    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS BY A LITTLE GIRL By Hilda Conkling With A Preface By Amy Lowell FOR YOU , MOTHER I have a dream for you , Mother , Like a soft thick fringe to hide your eyes . I have a surprise for you , Mother , Shaped like a strange butterfly . I have found a way of thinking To make you happy ; I have made a song and a poem All twisted into one . If I sing , you listen ; If I think , you know . I have a secret from everybody in the world full of people But I cannot always remember how it goes ; It is a song For you , Mother , With a curl of cloud and a feather of blue And a mist Blowing along the sky . If I sing it some day , under my voice , Will it make you happy ? Thanks are due to the editors of Poetry : A Magazine of Verse , The Delineator , Good Housekeeping , The Lyric , St. Nicholas , and Contemporary Verse for their courteous permission to reprint many of the following poems .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">A book which needs to be written is one dealing with the childhood of authors . It would be not only interesting , but instructive ; not merely profitable in a general way , but practical in a particular . We might hope , in reading it , to gain some sort of knowledge as to what environments and conditions are most conducive to the growth of the creative faculty . We might even learn how not to strangle this rare faculty in its early years .</p>
    <p n="2">At this moment I am faced with a difficult task , for here is an author and her childhood in a most unusual position ; these two conditions — that of being an author , and that of being a child — appear simultaneously , instead of in the due order to which we are accustomed . For I wish at the outset to state , and emphatically , that it is poetry , the stuff and essence of poetry , which this book contains . I know of no other instance in which such really beautiful poetry has been written by a child ; but , confronted with so unwonted a state of things , two questions obtrude themselves : how far has the condition of childhood been impaired by , not only the possession , but the expression , of the gift of writing ; how far has the condition of authorship ( at least in its more mature state still to come ) been hampered by this early leap into the light ?</p>
    <p n="3">The first question concerns the little girl and can best be answered by herself some twenty years hence ; the second concerns the world , and again the answer must wait . We can , however , do something — we can see what she is and what she has done . And if the one is interesting to the psychologist , the other is no less important to the poet .</p>
    <p n="4">Hilda Conkling is the younger daughter of Mrs. Grace Hazard Conkling , Assistant Professor of English at Smith College , Northampton , Massachusetts . At the time of writing , Hilda has just passed her ninth birthday . Her sister , Elsa , is two years her senior . The children and their mother live all the year round in Northampton , and glimpses of the woods and hills surrounding the little town crop up again and again in these poems . This is Emily Dickinson 's country , and there is a reminiscent sameness in the fauna and flora of her poems in these .</p>
    <p n="5">The two little girls go to a school a few blocks from where they live . In the afternoons , they take long walks with their mother , or play in the garden while she writes . On rainy days , there are books and Mrs. Conkling 's piano , which is not just a piano , for Mrs. Conkling is a musician , and we may imagine that the children hear a special music as they certainly read a special literature . By “ special ” I do not mean a prescribed course ( for dietitians of the mind are quite as apt to be faddists as dietitians of the stomach ) , but just that sort of reading which a person who passionately loves books would most want to introduce her children to . And here I think we have the answer to the why of Hilda . She and her sister have been their mother 's close companions ever since they were born . They have never known that somewhat equivocal relationship — a child with its nurse . They have never been for hours at a time in contact with an elementary intelligence . If Hilda had shown these poems to even the most sympathetic nurse , what would have been the result ? In the first place , they would , in all probability , have been lost , since Hilda does not write her poems , but tells them ; in the second , they would have been either extravagantly praised or laughingly commented upon . In either case , the fine flower of creation would most certainly have been injured .</p>
    <p n="6">Then again , blessed though many of the nurses of childhood undoubtedly are ( and we all remember them ) , they have no means of answering the thousand and one questions of an eager , opening mind . To be an adequate companion to childhood , one must know so many things . Hilda is fortunate in her mother , for if these poems reveal one thing more than another it is that Mrs. Conkling is dowered with an admirable tact . In the dedication poem to her mother , the little girl says :</p>
    <p n="7">“ If I sing , you listen ; If I think , you know . ”</p>
    <p n="8">No finer tribute could be offered by one person to another than the contented certainty of understanding in those two lines .</p>
    <p n="9">Hilda tells her poems , and the method of it is this : They come out in the course of conversation , and Mrs. Conkling is so often engaged in writing that there is nothing to be remarked if she scribbles absently while talking to the little girls . But this scribbling is really a complete draught of the poem . Occasionally Mrs. Conkling writes down the poem later from memory and reads it afterwards to the child , who always remembers if it is not exactly in its original form . No line , no cadence , is altered from Hilda 's version ; the titles have been added for convenience , but they are merely obvious handles derived from the text .</p>
    <p n="10">Naturally it is only a small proportion of Hilda 's life which is given to poetry . Much is devoted to running about , a part to study , etc . It is , however , significant that Hilda is not very keen about games with other children . Not that she is by any means either shy or solitary , but they do not greatly interest her . Doubtless childhood pays its debt of possession more steadily than we know .</p>
    <p n="11">Now to turn to the book itself ; at the very start , here is an amazing thing . This slim volume contains one hundred and seven separate poems , and that is counting as one all the very short pieces written between the ages of five and six . Certainly that is a remarkable output for a little girl , and the only possible explanation is that the poems are perfectly instinctive . There is no working over as with an adult poet . Hilda is subconscious , not self-conscious . Her mother says that she rarely hesitates for a word . When the feeling is strong , it speaks for itself . Read the dedication poem , “ For You , Mother . ” It is full of feeling , and of that simple , dignified , adequate diction which is the speech of feeling :</p>
    <p n="12">“ I have found a way of thinking To make you happy . ”</p>
    <p n="13">That is beautiful , and , once read , inevitable ; but it waited for a child to say . Poem after poem is charged with this feeling , this expression of great love :</p>
    <p n="14">“ I will sing you a song , Sweets-of-my-heart , With love in it , ( How I love you ! ) ”</p>
    <p n="15">“ Will you love me to-morrow after next As if I had a bird 's way of singing ? ”</p>
    <p n="16">But it is not only the pulse of feeling in such passages which makes them surprising ; it is the perfectly original expression of it . When one reads a thing and voluntarily exclaims : “ How beautiful ! How natural ! How true ! ” then one knows that one has stumbled upon that flash of personality which we call genius . These poems are full of such flashes :</p>
    <p n="17">“ Sparkle up , little tired flower Leaning in the grass ! ”</p>
    <p n="18">. . .</p>
    <p n="19">“ There is a star that runs very fast , That goes pulling the moon Through the tops of the poplars . ”</p>
    <p n="20">. . .</p>
    <p n="21">“ There is sweetness in the tree , And fireflies are counting the leaves . I like this country , I like the way it has . ”</p>
    <p n="22">A pansy has a “ thinking face ” ; a rooster has a comb “ gay as a parade , ” he shouts “ crooked words , loud . . . sharp . . . not beautiful ! ” ; frozen water is asked if it cannot “ lift ” itself “ with sun , ” and “ Easter morning says a glad thing over and over . ”</p>
    <p n="23">No matter who wrote them , those passages would be beautiful , the oldest poet in the world could not improve upon them ; and yet the reader has only to turn to the text to see the incredibly early age at which such expressions came into the author 's mind .</p>
    <p n="24">Where childhood betrays genius is in the mounting up of detail . Inadequate lines not infrequently jar a total effect , as when , in the poem of the star pulling the moon , she suddenly ends , “ Mr . Moon , does he make you hurry ? ” Or , speaking of a drop of water :</p>
    <p n="25">“ So it went on with its life For several years Until at last it was never heard of Any more . ”</p>
    <p n="26">This is the perennial child , thinking as children think ; and we are glad of it . It makes the whole more healthy , more sure of development . When the subconscious mind of Hilda Conkling takes a vacation , she does not “ nod , ” as erstwhile Homer ; she merely reverts to type and is a child again .</p>
    <p n="27">I think too highly of these poems to speak of the volume as though it were the finished achievement of a grown-up person . Some of the poems can be taken in that way , but by no means all . The child who writes them frequently transcends herself , but her thoughts for the most part are those proper to every imaginative child . Fairies play a large role in her fancies , and so does the sandman . There are kings , and princesses , and golden wings , and there are reminiscences of story-books , and hints of pictures that have pleased her . After all , that is the way we all make our poems , but the grown-up poet tries to get away from his author , he tries to see more than the painter has seen . The little girl is quite untroubled by any questions of technique . She takes what to her is the obvious always , and in these copied pieces it is , naturally , less her own peculiar obvious than in the nature poems .</p>
    <p n="28">Hilda Conkling is evidently possessed of a rare and accurate power of observation . And when we add this to her gift of imagination , we see that it is the perfectly natural play of these two faculties which makes what to her is an obvious expression . She does not search for it , it is her natural mode of thought . But , luckily for her , she has been guided by a wisdom which has not attempted to show her a better way . Her observation has been carefully , but unobtrusively , cultivated ; her imagination has been stimulated by the reading of excellent books ; but both these lines of instruction have been kept apparently apart from her own work . She has been let alone there ; she has been taught by an analogy which she has never suspected . By this means , her poetical gift has functioned happily , without ever for a moment experiencing the tension of doubt .</p>
    <p n="29">A few passages will serve to show how well Hilda knows how to use her eyes :</p>
    <p n="30">“ The water came in with a wavy look Like a spider 's web . ”</p>
    <p n="31">A bluebird has a back “ like a feathered sky . ” Apostrophizing a snow-capped mountain she writes :</p>
    <p n="32">“ You shine like a lily But with a different whiteness . ”</p>
    <p n="33">She asks a humming-bird :</p>
    <p n="34">“ Why do you stand on the air And no sun shining ? ”</p>
    <p n="35">She hears a chickadee :</p>
    <p n="36">“ Far off I hear him talking The way smooth bright pebbles Drop into water . ”</p>
    <p n="37">Now let us follow her a step farther , to where the imagination takes a firmer hold :</p>
    <p n="38">“ The world turns softly Not to spill its lakes and rivers . The water is held in its arms And the sky is held in the water . ”</p>
    <p n="39">School lessons , and a reflection in a pond — that is the stuff of which all poetry is made . It is the fusion which shows the quality of the poet . Turn to the text and read “ Geography . ” Really , this is an extraordinary child !</p>
    <p n="40">It is pleasant to watch her with the artist 's eagerness intrigued by the sounds of words , for instance :</p>
    <p n="41">“ — silvery lonesome lapping of the long wave . ”</p>
    <p n="42">Again , enchanted by a little bell of rhyme , we have this amusing catalogue :</p>
    <p n="43">“ John-flowers , Mary-flowers , Polly-flowers Cauli-flowers . ”</p>
    <p n="44">That is the conscious Hilda , the gay little girl , but it shows a quick ear nevertheless . We can almost hear the giggle with which that “ Cauliflowers ” came out . Usually rhyme does not appear to be a matter of moment to her . Some poets think in rhyme , some do not ; Hilda evidently belongs to the second category . “ Treasure , ” and “ The Apple-Jelly-Fish-Tree , ” and “ Short Story ” are the only poems in the book which seem to follow a clearly rhymed pattern . If any misguided schoolmistress had ever suggested that a poem should have rhyme and metre , this book would never have been “ told . ” In “ Moon Doves , ” however , there is a distinctly metrical effect without rhyme . But the great majority of the poems are built upon cadence , and the subtlety of this little girl 's cadences are a delight to those who can hear them . Doubtless her musical inheritance has all to do with this , for in poem after poem the instinct for rhythm is unerring . So constantly is this the case , that it is scarcely necessary to point out particular examples . I may , however , name , as two of her best for other qualities as well , “ Gift , ” and “ Poems . ” The latter contains two of her quick strokes of observation and comparison : the morning “ like the inside of a snow-apple , ” and she herself curled “ cushion-shaped ” in the window-seat .</p>
    <p n="45">Dear me ! How simple these poems seem when you read them done . But try to write something new about a dandelion . Try it ; and then read the poem of that name here . It is charming ; how did she think of it ? How indeed !</p>
    <p n="46">Delightful conceits she has — another is “ Sun Flowers ” — but how comes a child of eight to prick and point with the rapier of irony ? For it is nothing less than irony in “ The Tower and the Falcon . ” Did she quite grasp its meaning herself ? We may doubt it . In this poem , the subconscious is very much on the job .</p>
    <p n="47">To my thinking , the most successful poems in the book — and now I mean successful from a grown-up standpoint — are “ For You , Mother , ” “ Red Rooster , ” “ Gift , ” “ Poems , ” “ Dandelion , ” “ Butterfly , ” “ Weather , ” “ Hills , ” and “ Geography . ” And it will be noticed that these are precisely the poems which must have sprung from actual experience . They are not the book poems , not even the fairy poems , they are the records of reactions from actual happenings . I have not a doubt that Hilda prefers her fairy-stories . They are the conscious play of her imagination , it must be “ fun ” to make them . Ah , but it is the unconscious with which we are most concerned , those very poems which are probably to her the least interesting are the ones which most certainly reveal the fulness of poetry from which she draws . She probably hardly thought at all , so natural was it , to say that three pinks “ smell like more of them in a blue vase , ” but the expression fills the air with so strong a scent that no superlative could increase it .</p>
    <p n="48">“ Gift ” is a lovely poem , it has feeling , expression , originality , cadence . If a child can write such a poem at eight years old , what does it mean ? That depends , I think , on how long the instructors of youth can be persuaded to keep “ hands off . ” A period of imitation is , I fear , inevitable , but if consciousness is not induced by direct criticism , if instruction in the art of writing is abjured , the imitative period will probably be got through without undue loss . I think there is too much native sense of beauty and proportion here to be entirely killed even by the drying and freezing process which goes by the name of education .</p>
    <p n="49">What this book chiefly shows is high promise ; but it also has its pages of real achievement , and that of so high an order it may well set us pondering . AMY LOWELL .</p>

   <p>I Rosy plum-tree , think of me When Spring comes down the world !</p>

   <p>III Oh wrinkling star , wrinkling up so wise , When you go to sleep do you shut your eyes ?</p>
   <p>IV The red moon comes out in the night . When I 'm asleep , the moon comes pattering up Into the trees . Then I peep out my window To watch the moon go by .</p>
   <p>V Sparkle up , little tired flower Leaning in the grass ! Did you find the rain of night Too heavy to hold ?</p>
   <p>VI The garden is full of flowers All dancing round and round . John-flowers , Mary-flowers , Polly-flowers , Cauli-flowers , They dance round and round And they bow down and down To a black-eyed daisy .</p>
   <p>VII There is going to be the sound of bells And murmuring . This is the brook dance : There is going to be sound of voices , And the smallest will be the brook : It is the song of water You will hear , A little winding song To dance to . . .</p>

     <l n="4">On raindrops sliding ?</l>
     <l n="5">They change and fall , they are not steady ,</l>
     <l n="6">But you do not know they are gone .</l>
     <l n="7">Is there a silver wire</l>
     <l n="8">I cannot see ?</l>
     <l n="9">Is the wind your perch ?</l>
     <l n="10">Raindrops slide down your little shoulders . . .</l>
     <l n="11">They do not wet you :</l>
     <l n="12">I think you are not real</l>
     <l n="13">In your green feathers !</l>
     <l n="14">You are not a humming-bird at all</l>
     <l n="15">Standing on air above the garden !</l>
     <l n="16">I dreamed you the way I dream fairies ,</l>
     <l n="17">Or the flower I lost yesterday !</l>

    <head>BLUE GRASS</head>
     <l n="1">Blue grass flowering in the field ,</l>
     <l n="2">You are my heart 's content .</l>
     <l n="3">It is not only through the day I see you ,</l>
     <l n="4">But in dreams at night</l>
     <l n="5">When you trudge up the hill</l>
     <l n="6">Along the forest ,</l>
     <l n="7">As I do !</l>
     <l n="8">You are small to shine so ,</l>
     <l n="9">Nobody speaks of you much ,</l>
     <l n="10">Because of daisies and such summer blooms .</l>
     <l n="11">When you wonder why I like you</l>
     <l n="12">It makes me wonder too !</l>
     <l n="13">Maybe I remember when you grew high</l>
     <l n="14">Like a tree above my head ,</l>
     <l n="15">Because I was a fairy .</l>

     <l n="2">And there are things to do ,</l>
     <l n="3">It seems to be the reason</l>
     <l n="4">Of this world !</l>
