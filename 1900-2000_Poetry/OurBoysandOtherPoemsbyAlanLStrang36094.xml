    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">Alan L. Strang was born in Spokane , Washington , August 18 , 1908 . Living there until he was four years old , he came to California in 1913 with his parents , making their home in Redwood City .</p>
    <p n="2">He had a gentle , loving disposition , was always frail and delicate and possessed a mental development far in advance of his years . He was taken to the Great Beyond January 29 , 1919 .</p>
    <p n="3">The poems contained in this book were written prior to his tenth birthday . Considering the age of the author we feel that the work contains real merit , while the sentiment expressed betokens that patriotic spirit which never fails or hesitates when our country calls for men .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Do not worry over trifles , though to you they may seem great , All your fretting will not help you , or your troubles dissipate .</p>
   <p>If your sky is dark and gloomy , and the sun is hid from view , Bravely smile and keep on smiling , And your friends will smile with you .</p>
   <p>Happiness is so contagious , and a smile is never lost ; Then why worry over trifles , tho your heart seems tempest tossed .</p>
   <p>Therefore go on life 's journey with an optimistic smile , See the world is good to live in , and that living is worth while .</p>
   <p>How can we Fool the Rooster ?</p>
   <p>Written when the clock was set ahead one hour on April 1 , 1918 .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Our Rooster wakes at half-past five</l>
     <l n="2">And crows with all his might ,</l>
     <l n="3">He tries to wake the people up</l>

     <l n="5">When Daddy hears the rooster crow</l>
     <l n="6">He knows he should awake</l>

     <l n="10">That it 's half-past five when it 's half-past four ,</l>
     <l n="11">And maybe the system 's the best we have had</l>

     <l n="13">But , how can we fool that rooster ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">I have always thought our rooster had</l>
     <l n="15">A clock inside of his head ,</l>
     <l n="16">And I do n't know how we can fix it so</l>
     <l n="17">We can set the clock ahead .</l>
     <l n="18">I asked my Dad , and he said to me ,</l>
     <l n="19">“ Why , son , you surely know</l>
     <l n="20">A rooster 's instinct wakens him</l>
     <l n="21">And tells him when to crow . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="22">Now the hands of the clock we can turn ahead ,</l>
     <l n="23">We can fool the people and feel content ;</l>
     <l n="24">But the thing that worries me night and day ,</l>
     <l n="25">And on which my entire thought is bent</l>
     <l n="26">Is , how can we fool that rooster ?</l>

     <l n="22">Masata</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Masata was an Indian boy , he lived on the banks of the Ohio River in Kentucky . During the Revolutionary War in 1771 , the Americans were taking over the land very fast , and when Masata was ten years old his parents moved to the wild regions of the Dakotas , taking Masata with them .</p>
   <p>Here he enjoyed life although it was much colder than in his native Kentucky , and in the Winter months he wore coats of fur made from bear skin .</p>
   <p>The days soon became filled with interesting things for Masata . One day when he was roaming through the wilds , he heard a wild buffalo approaching . He seemed almost helpless , as he had nothing but a small bow and a few arrows , and the buffalo was only a short distance from him . He began to run in what he thought was the direction of his home , but instead he was going in the opposite way . In a few minutes he saw the smoke of a camp fire and ran toward it . By this time the beast was very close to him and he was almost in despair , when the buffalo lurched forward , then rolled over dead . Three Indians hunting near by had hit him in a vital spot with an arrow .</p>
   <p>The Indians belonged to a tribe which was his father 's most bitter enemy , and they took him before their chief . The chief ordered that he be let live for two moons , and he was given a bed of dry twigs to sleep on as the night was drawing near .</p>
   <p>Time passed quietly for Masata until the approach of the morning of the second moon . He had been planning how he would escape from his father 's enemies . Finally one morning he slipped into a bear skin and hopped bravely off toward the woods . The Indians thinking he was a bear , shot arrows at him and wounded him in the right arm , but Masata kept bravely on and was soon out of range of the arrows . Then he bandaged his wounded arm the best he could and set out for his father 's wigwam .</p>
   <p>He arrived safely the same evening , and his parents were overjoyed to see him and know he was safe once more , and the tribe made a great feast , or as they call it , Pow Wow , as a welcome to his home coming .</p>
   <p>While Masata was still a young “ brave ” their chief died and after a great ceremony , Masata was made Chief of the tribes , and was known as great and good ruler .</p>
