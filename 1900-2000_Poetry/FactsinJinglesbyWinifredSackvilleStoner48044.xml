    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">These jingles were written by a child for children . The young author does not expect that any one will imagine they were intended to be a contribution to poetry or literature . They will be of interest to adults principally as an illustration of the way a child 's mind views some of the every-day situations of life . Grown people will also be interested to see how easily a young child can put facts into the jingle form when freedom of expression is acquired early .</p>
    <p n="2">Those who have read Mrs. Stoner 's Natural Education will recall that Winifred learned almost as a babe to use the typewriter . This helped her in her spelling and composition , so that she gained ease and freedom in expressing herself on any topic that she understood . She wrote out everything she learned so that she might the better get a grasp of it and remember it . And she found that when some kinds of facts were put together in a jingle they could be fixed with less effort and retained more securely than if they were learned in the ordinary way — by rote and without any method of organization .</p>
    <p n="3">Rhyme and rhythm seem to furnish to the young mind an easy and effective method of relating and expressing facts ordinarily dissociated from anything of interest to a child . As long as such facts are presented to the young in home and school , the jingle will prove of service to teachers and parents , and of interest and value to children . In addition , some of these jingles will delight the young merely because of their rhythmical quality , while others will afford amusement because of the humorous interpretation they put on many of the events that are daily experienced by children everywhere .</p>
    <p n="4">Any adult who may read these jingles should be informed that many of them were written when Winifred was hardly more than a babe . And all of them were dashed off without effort to achieve poetic merit . One characteristic that makes them of interest is their spontaneity . As an illustration of the readiness with which Winifred can construct a jingle , I may say that when she was twelve years of age , I happened one day to read her the following essay on Bones written by a pupil :</p>
    <p n="5">“ Bones is the framework of the body . If I had no bones in me , I should not have so much shape as I have now . If I had no bones my brain , heart , lungs , and larger blood vessels would be lying around in me , and might get hurt . If my bones were burned I should be brittle , because it would take the animal out of me . If I was soaked in acid I should be limber . I 'd rather be soaked than burned . Some of my bones do n't grow close to my others snug like the branches to the trunk of a tree . The reason why they do n't grow that way is because they have joints . Joints is good things to have in bones . All my bones put together make a skeleton . Some animals have their skeleton on the outside . I am glad I am not them animals , for my skeleton like it is on the chart would not look very well on my outside . ”</p>
    <p n="6">I asked her if she would put the essay into a rhyme . She ran off to her typewriter , and in twelve minutes came back with the jingle , I 'm glad I 'm not an Exo . It is published exactly as she handed it to me , without change in content or in form .</p>
    <p n="7">Mrs. Stoner 's Natural Education describes in detail how Winifred has been educated up to this point in her career . This book of jingles presents some concrete evidence of the results of Mrs. Stoner 's method of teaching freedom of expression , and her many devices for assisting a child to retain more or less formal facts in history , the sciences , and so on . The book will prove of interest and help to children , and parents and teachers should be able to get suggestions and practical teaching devices from it .</p>

    <docImprint>Ever since I was five years old my dear friends , the fairies , have whispered jingles to me as keys to Memory 's storehouse . As these jingles have been of great assistance in my studies , I have asked my good publishers to put them in book form with the hope that they may help , or at least amuse , many girls and boys .</docImprint>

    <head>NISSEN , THE SANTA CLAUS OF NORWAY</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How glad I am that I was born in this land very dear ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where children have a Santa Claus of whom they have no fear ;</l>
     <l n="3">A Santa who is always kind , remembering one and all</l>
     <l n="4">When every year at Christmas time , he pays us all a call .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">In far away chill Norway , there NISSEN is the name</l>
     <l n="6">Of the Christmas visitor who bears good Santa 's fame ;</l>
     <l n="7">But he 's a naughty brownie so short and very small ,</l>
     <l n="8">Not a bit like Santa who pays us all a call .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">But , like our good gift giver , his beard is long and white ,</l>
     <l n="10">And he wears a coat of furs and many colors bright .</l>
     <l n="11">But instead of bringing goodies to good girls and to boys ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nice new clothes and books and games and lots of wondrous toys ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">He expects that all big folks and also little ones</l>
     <l n="14">Should leave his favorite dishes , such as puddings , cakes and buns ,</l>
     <l n="15">Outside of every doorway so that he may eat at will</l>
     <l n="16">Of these luscious dainties until he has had his fill .</l>
     <l n="17">Then after eating all the cakes his “ tummy-tum ” can hold ,</l>
     <l n="18">He milks the cows and splits the wood ( at least , so I 've been told ) ,</l>
     <l n="19">But never thinks to bring nice gifts to little girls and boys</l>
     <l n="20">Whose parents have to trim their trees and buy them all their toys .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">Besides , this naughty NISSEN is cross at times and bad ,</l>
     <l n="22">And does all sorts of horrid tricks which I think very sad</l>
     <l n="23">At Christmas when we all should be so kind to one another ,</l>
     <l n="24">And treat each person whom we meet as if he were our brother .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="25">But NISSEN steals away the cows and even horses fleet ,</l>
     <l n="26">From all the people who forget to bake him puddings sweet ;</l>
     <l n="27">And if above a whisper one should dare to speak or sing</l>
     <l n="28">About this cranky fellow , then this evil he will bring</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="29">Upon the one who dared to throw his name upon the breeze , As from that</l>
     <l n="30">time the guilty one must sneeze and sneeze and sneeze .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Now in our land we sing loud praise of Santa all the time , And tell about his goodness great , in prose and jingling rhyme ; And yet it seems the more we sing about the jolly elf , The more he brings each year to us upon the mantel shelf .</p>
   <p>But children in far Norway are better girls and boys Than we who live in this fair land and think so much of toys That we forget about the pets while feeding our own selves Like thoughtless , greedy little pigs or naughty selfish elves .</p>
   <p>While Norway children in the fall they work to gather corn And save it for the birds they feed on every Christmas morn ; So we should follow in their steps and feed the wee birds crumbs Before we start to feast ourselves on Christmas sugar plums .</p>

    <p>SANTA 'S REINDEER IN THE SKY</p>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Long , long ago before this earth had any girls and boys</l>
     <l n="10">To hang their stockings on the shelf expecting Christmas toys ,</l>
     <l n="11">Good Santa was a big white cloud that floated in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="12">If you had lived in those old days , you 'd seen him floating by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">But when the children came to rule upon good Mother Earth ,</l>
     <l n="14">She took kind Santa from the sky and made him God of Mirth ;</l>
     <l n="15">To bring at every Christmas time good gifts to girls and boys</l>
     <l n="16">And make them all so happy with a lot of lovely toys .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Far , far among the icebergs , in the cold and freezing zone ,</l>
     <l n="18">She built for him a palace , where he lives almost alone ,</l>
     <l n="19">With only good old Mrs. Claus to keep him company ,</l>
     <l n="20">And sometimes Cousin Nicholas for two days or for three .</l>
     <l n="21">Wise Mother Earth she knew this clime would suit good Santa well ,</l>
     <l n="22">For here no foolish , idle folks would ever come to dwell ;</l>
     <l n="23">Nor pay the good Saint visits which would waste his precious time ,</l>
     <l n="24">While he could work much faster here than in a warmer clime .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="25">But never did he suffer from the icebergs at the Pole ,</l>
     <l n="26">As fairies kept his fireplace all full of red-hot coal ;</l>
     <l n="27">Or heaped bright burning logs on it as full as it could hold ,</l>
     <l n="28">So Santa never felt a tweak of Jack Frost 's biting cold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="29">Likewise the fairies brought to him and his most faithful spouse ,</l>
     <l n="30">Just everything that they could need to keep a cozy house .</l>
     <l n="31">And even cooked their victuals and brought them every day</l>
     <l n="32">Exactly at the proper time , upon a huge hot tray .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="33">And after they had eaten all the dainties on the tray ,</l>
     <l n="34">The good kind fairies quickly came and took the tray away ;</l>
     <l n="35">So Mrs. Claus had no excuse for being cross or sad ,</l>
     <l n="36">Since no experience she had had with Bridgets getting mad .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="37">When Santa finished all his toys , he put them in a sack ,</l>
     <l n="38">Where he intended carrying them just like a pedler 's pack ,</l>
     <l n="39">But Mother Earth surprised the Saint and to his palace led</l>
     <l n="40">Eight lovely prancing reindeer and a large commodious sled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="41">These reindeer were the cousins of swift Pegasus , the steed</l>
     <l n="42">Who helped the hero Perseus when he was in great need ;</l>
     <l n="43">And , like the flying hero horse , they lived up in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="44">Till Mother Earth had need of them to help old Santa fly .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="45">And so on every Christmas eve for full ten hundred years ,</l>
     <l n="46">Good Santa and his reindeer fleet have banished children 's tears</l>
     <l n="47">By bringing them most all the gifts their little hearts could wish ,</l>
     <l n="48">And filling stockings , shoes and plates , and even puddin dish .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="49">But when last Christmas came around , good Mother Earth , she said ,</l>
     <l n="50">“ Dear Santa , I have something fine for you to use instead</l>
     <l n="51">Of your good , faithful reindeer and your big old-fashioned sled ,</l>
     <l n="52">For here 's a lovely aeroplane , all painted shining red . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="53">The wise old lady then declared that he could safely fly</l>
     <l n="54">With this machine most anywhere away up in the sky ,</l>
     <l n="55">And travel far , far faster than the reindeer who were fleet</l>
     <l n="56">But stumbled sometimes on the roofs made slippery with sleet .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="57">The aeroplane could carry well a larger load of toys ,</l>
     <l n="58">So he could visit more good girls and also little boys ,</l>
     <l n="59">Who live in far off heathen lands where everyone 's a sinner ,</l>
     <l n="60">But that 's no reason each should do without a Christmas dinner .</l>
     <l n="61">With this machine he 'd save some time to look out for each pet</l>
     <l n="62">Of all the little girls and boys , as they so oft forget</l>
     <l n="63">To treat their pets most kindly upon the Christmas morn</l>
     <l n="64">In memory of the Saviour who on this day was born .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="65">And likewise all the horses , the cows and pigs and sheep ,</l>
     <l n="66">For men so seldom think of them when Christmas time they keep ;</l>
     <l n="67">And even wild , fierce animals , and fishes in the sea ,</l>
     <l n="68">Should all be made quite happy at Christmas time to be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="69">“ I do not like this plan at all of giving up my sled</l>
     <l n="70">And my good faithful reindeer , ” so good old Santa said .</l>
     <l n="71">But Mother Earth she laughed at him and said she would repay</l>
     <l n="72">The reindeer , whom she would send home straight to the Milky Way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="73">But Santa was old-fashioned and had great fears to fly</l>
     <l n="74">Without his sled and reindeer , he 'd used in years gone by ,</l>
     <l n="75">And begged that on his maiden trip these true old friends to take</l>
     <l n="76">To help him should the aeroplane prove but a wicked fake .</l>
     <l n="77">The laughing Earth then granted him this very small request ,</l>
     <l n="78">And early on glad Christmas eve ( the eve of all most blest )</l>
     <l n="79">He started forth upon his trip , did good old Santa dear ,</l>
     <l n="80">Guiding his Wright aeroplane with feelings of great fear .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="81">But Mother Earth showed she was wise and knew just what was best</l>
     <l n="82">To help the good old tired saint while on his children quest ;</l>
     <l n="83">And fast the good Wright aeroplane it flew both low and high ,</l>
     <l n="84">So Santa took the Earth 's advice , and though he heaved a sigh ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="85">He dropped the poor old worn-out sled as he was passing by ,</l>
     <l n="86">And people said , who saw it fall , “ A meteor from the sky ! ”</l>
     <l n="87">Then , kissing each good reindeer , he bade them all farewell ,</l>
     <l n="88">And left them in the Milky Way , forever there to dwell .</l>
     <l n="89">And you , my little playmates , who have heard the tiny hoofs</l>
     <l n="90">Of the wondrous flying steeds pattering on the roofs ,</l>
     <l n="91">If you would like to catch a glimpse of Santa 's good reindeer ,</l>
     <l n="92">Then wait until it 's dark some night , and when the sky is clear ,</l>
     <l n="93">You 'll see them very plainly in the broad light Milky Way ,</l>
     <l n="94">And there , for all the time to come , these steeds will romp and play .</l>

     <l n="97">They pick at my teeth and scratch in my head</l>
     <l n="98">Until I begin to wish I were dead .</l>

    <head>THE PURE-BLOODED PUP</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Once there was a little pup who lived in far-off Kent ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where he was born some years ago in kennels of Lord Dent ;</l>
     <l n="3">His mother was of purest blood and likewise was his pa ,</l>
     <l n="4">So he arrived upon this earth without a single flaw .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">His tail was just the proper size and so was each small ear ,</l>
     <l n="6">His shapely legs and nose and paws , they pleased his mother dear ;</l>
     <l n="7">And with her soft and scarlet tongue she kissed her baby pup ,</l>
     <l n="8">And loved him , oh , so dearly that she almost ate him up .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">The keeper of the kennels when he saw this terrier pup ,</l>
     <l n="10">Declared , “ It 's just a beauty and will surely win ‘ THE CUP , ’</l>
     <l n="11">For being a fox terrier of very purest breed ,</l>
     <l n="12">And now to my dear master I 'll go with greatest speed .</l>
     <l n="13">“ And tell him of this puppy who will bring our kennels fame ,</l>
     <l n="14">And ask him what he thinks will be a truly proper name</l>
     <l n="15">For the most perfect terrier that ever came to Kent ;</l>
     <l n="16">It seems to me he should be called for my great master ‘ Dent . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">The master when he heard the news that a new pup had come ,</l>
     <l n="18">Left off his game of playing cards and drinking pints of rum ,</l>
     <l n="19">And hastened to the kennels to behold the wondrous pup ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who at the coming dog show was to win the great prize cup .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">The mother dog she wagged her tail , with pride she was puffed up ,</l>
     <l n="22">As her great master stood right near and smiled upon her pup ,</l>
     <l n="23">While saying , “ Higgens , listen well to what I have to say ,</l>
     <l n="24">And care for this good mother dog and her fine pup each day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="25">“ I 'll name him for my ancestor , the great and famous Kent ,</l>
     <l n="26">And in that name to the dog show next year he shall be sent ,</l>
     <l n="27">Where I am sure he 'll win the prize above all others there ,</l>
     <l n="28">For he is perfect in his shape and has fine silky hair . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="29">So little Kent was tended well and petted every day ,</l>
     <l n="30">He never had to seek for bones and only had to play ,</l>
     <l n="31">And having nothing else to do on mischief he was bent ,</l>
     <l n="32">Was this aristocratic pup , owned by the great Lord Dent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="33">And when a year had passed around , one day the master came</l>
     <l n="34">To take him to the London show , where he would win great fame ;</l>
     <l n="35">But Kent was very naughty , as he did not wish to go</l>
     <l n="36">Away from his good kennel home to any prize dog show .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="37">At last his master whipped Pup Kent and , oh , but he did swear ,</l>
     <l n="38">Because Kent snapped at Higgens , who was combing his fine hair</l>
     <l n="39">And putting on a collar with a chain of golden beads ;</l>
     <l n="40">Such ornaments Kent could not see that any puppy needs .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="41">At last the royal pup was dressed in pupdom regal style ,</l>
     <l n="42">And drove in a fine carriage , oh , for many a weary mile ,</l>
     <l n="43">Until he came to London town , where nothing he could see ,</l>
     <l n="44">Because all things were hidden with a fog as thick as could be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="45">Before he 'd even time to think , this ‘ ristocratic pup ,</l>
     <l n="46">He found himself in a small cage with all the doors shut up ,</l>
     <l n="47">And many men were standing round and gazing long at him ,</l>
     <l n="48">While passing comments on his shape of head , and tail , and limb .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="49">Kent glared at them in silence and he would not wag his tail ,</l>
     <l n="50">In fact , just like a good young boy who might be put in jail</l>
     <l n="51">When he had never done a thing to break the country 's law ,</l>
     <l n="52">So felt this little terrier , this pup without a flaw .</l>
     <l n="53">And when the judges thought that he should have the ribbon blue</l>
     <l n="54">Because of his most perfect blood shown by the records true ,</l>
     <l n="55">He snapped and barked and even bit at those who came quite near</l>
     <l n="56">To tie the lovely ribbon on the neck of “ PUPPY DEAR . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="57">So they decided that despite his wondrous pedigree</l>
     <l n="58">There yet was something in his blood that ought not there to be ,</l>
     <l n="59">And gave the prize , a silver cup , to a more common dog ,</l>
     <l n="60">Who lay so still and quiet that he might have been a log .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="61">But when that evening our Lord Dent beheld with great surprise</l>
     <l n="62">That a less blooded terrier had won the noble prize ,</l>
     <l n="63">He felt so very angry that he wished to beat Pup Kent ,</l>
     <l n="64">And ordered that the beastly dog should quickly home be sent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="65">But while poor Kent was going home so sad and in disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="66">He got away from Higgens and he found another place</l>
     <l n="67">Far , far away from kennels of the great and wealthy Dent ,</l>
     <l n="68">Near to a peaceful village , the runaway he went .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="69">Here he lay down so tired and thought of many a bone ,</l>
     <l n="70">Which now was being gnawed each day by his good ma alone ,</l>
     <l n="71">Since Kent , her darling puppy boy , was , oh , so far away ,</l>
     <l n="72">Oh , how he wished to gnaw a bone with his good ma this day !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="73">But as he lay a-dreaming of lovely things to eat ,</l>
     <l n="74">Quite suddenly a large gray rat ran right across his feet ,</l>
     <l n="75">And after it there followed an Irishman named Pat ,</l>
     <l n="76">Who sought to make a timely end of bad old Mister Rat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="77">Big Pat was armed with a huge club and called to his old dog ,</l>
     <l n="78">“ Now , come along , ye lazy baste , before he 's in the bog ! ”</l>
     <l n="79">Then Kent he jumped and in one bound he seized poor Mister Rat ,</l>
     <l n="80">Shook him about till he was dead and then brought him to Pat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="81">Big Pat he gazed in wonder at the clever little dog ,</l>
     <l n="82">And sitting down upon a large and green , moss covered log ,</l>
     <l n="83">Said , “ Shure , ye bate this lazy hound that kennot catch a rat ,</l>
     <l n="84">And if ye 'll stay right here , me boy , I 'll trate ye well , ” says Pat .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="85">Then proudly Kent he wagged his tail and tried so hard to smile</l>
     <l n="86">Upon the good old Irishman , who patted him a while ,</l>
     <l n="87">Then coaxed the stranger after him right through a broad green lane ,</l>
     <l n="88">Which led to the fine country home of good Sir Michael Kane .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="89">And here Pat introduced the pup to all the family ,</l>
     <l n="90">And they were all so very kind as any folks could be .</l>
     <l n="91">They patted his soft silky hair and praised him to the sky ,</l>
     <l n="92">And gave him a big gravy dish all filled with nice meat pie ,</l>
     <l n="93">And likewise a huge saucer , which was full of real sweet cream ,</l>
     <l n="94">Which made the hungry doggie think that he was in a dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="95">So here Dog Kent decided was the best place for to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="96">And here he still is living and is feeling ’ very well .</l>
     <l n="97">He goes each morning to the barn and helps his good friend Pat</l>
     <l n="98">To catch the naughty rodents , who are called the name of RAT .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="99">The cook she feeds him daily , and he captures all the mice ,</l>
     <l n="100">Which love to haunt the kitchen of the cleanly Bridget Bryce .</l>
     <l n="101">While little Mikey loves dear Kent far more than all his toys ,</l>
     <l n="102">And says that he 'd rather play with him than any girls or boys ,</l>
     <l n="103">Because he never minds a bit to jump right in the pond</l>
     <l n="104">And bring to land a stick or stone or weeping willow wand .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="105">He always acts politely to all who may come near ,</l>
     <l n="106">And so all strangers pet him and think he is a dear .</l>
     <l n="107">They like his soft and silky hair , which proves he has good blood ,</l>
     <l n="108">And never does he make folks mad by tracking floors with mud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="109">He 's wiser than most common dogs , whose hair is rough and coarse ,</l>
     <l n="110">His bark is always pleasant , and ‘ tis never loud nor hoarse ;</l>
     <l n="111">He 's swifter also than slow dogs who cannot catch a rat ,</l>
     <l n="112">Because they always eat too much and get so very fat .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MORAL :</head>
     <l n="1">This story proves that good , pure blood is a fine thing to own ,</l>
     <l n="2">But it can n't help the puppies or the children all alone ,</l>
     <l n="3">Unless these youthful puppies and the children , very small ,</l>
     <l n="4">Learn to keep quite busy and to have a smile for all .</l>

     <l n="6">But often it is not as big .</l>
     <l n="7">It has four legs just like a horse ,</l>
     <l n="8">But never runs on a race-course .</l>
     <l n="9">It gives good milk , though not as much</l>
     <l n="10">As cows and elephants and such ,</l>
     <l n="11">But more than any bull or ox ,</l>
     <l n="12">Rooster , ram , or sly old fox .</l>
     <l n="13">Like any mule , a goat likes hay</l>
     <l n="14">And all tin cans we throw away .</l>
     <l n="15">He 's useful and I 'm fond of him ,</l>
     <l n="16">But some good folks have a strange whim</l>
     <l n="17">To hold their noses when he 's near ,</l>
     <l n="18">And act as if they greatly fear</l>
     <l n="19">To touch his fur which has the smell</l>
     <l n="20">Of something I know very well ,</l>
     <l n="21">The odor I 'd know anywhere ,</l>
     <l n="22">It 's like Dad 's tonic for his hair .</l>

    <head>THE KING 'S QUESTIONS</head>

     <l n="1">Once on a time , long , long ago , in a far-off foreign land ,</l>
     <l n="2">A certain king who loved to roam with his chosen courtly band ,</l>
     <l n="3">Was riding abroad one early morn through streets of a city fair</l>
     <l n="4">When a curious sign above a door caused him to pause and stare .</l>
     <l n="5">This sign board plainly read to all that here was Wisdom 's college</l>
     <l n="6">With a Professor at its head of UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE .</l>
     <l n="7">“ Ha ! Ha ! ” loud laughed the wily king while rapping on the door ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ ‘ Tis true above all other men I need a goodly store</l>
     <l n="9">Of UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE so that I may wisely rule</l>
     <l n="10">And never say a foolish thing nor act the silly fool . ”</l>

     <l n="11">But when the great (? ) Professor X — appeared within the door ,</l>
     <l n="12">With trembling hands and downcast eyes , while bowing to the floor</l>
     <l n="13">The king gazed at the coward and this is what he said ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ You answer my three questions or you will lose your head .</l>
     <l n="15">Now first since you know everything please tell me what I 'm worth ,</l>
     <l n="16">And second tell the number of baskets of good earth</l>
     <l n="17">That one may find by digging within that mountain there</l>
     <l n="18">Reaching with its snow capped crown away up in the air .</l>
     <l n="19">And when you 've rightly answered these questions given you</l>
     <l n="20">Then you must tell me of my thoughts to prove your wisdom true .</l>
     <l n="21">Three days is all I 'll give you to answer me or go</l>

     <l n="41">It does n't even take a man who could be called quite wise</l>
     <l n="42">To tell you that this all depends upon the basket 's size .</l>
     <l n="43">For if the basket 's mountain size of course but one will do</l>
     <l n="44">But if it 's only half as large then we must needs have two . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="45">Delighted with these answers the King shook Jim 's rough hand ,</l>
     <l n="46">While smiling as he looked at him and gave his last command ,</l>
     <l n="47">“ Now tell me what I 'm thinking of , you wizard of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="48">And if you answer truly , yours is this pearl of worth . ”</l>
     <l n="49">“ Oh , that is very simple , ” Jim quickly answered him ,</l>
