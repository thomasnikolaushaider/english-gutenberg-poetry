   <div type="introduction">
    <head>Foreword</head>
    <p n="1">We all of us know that the ordinary every-day man and woman , the people we brush against in street cars , the people who read the funnies -  the people who are like us -  are capable of the profoundest depths of feeling and the noblest aspirations . But it is only on the rarest occasions that we happen to see one of them at it , so to speak , and when we do we have a certain sense of shame at intruding on something that really should be private between him and his God .</p>
    <p n="2">The artist enables us to see this ordinary man and woman in the moments when they are not ordinary , without any of this sense of intrusion . I think Mona Gould , in most of the verses in this volume , has been exceptionally successful in this kind of revelation , and I think Canada needs it . A number of these verses have been published in “ Saturday Night ” during the term of my editorship , and I am very glad that they are now to have a more permanent resting place .</p>

       <l n="3">Little orange willow switches</l>
       <l n="4">Hardly bending ;</l>
       <l n="5">Remember the white shore road</l>
       <l n="6">And the blue water in the Bay</l>
       <l n="7">Still fretted with clotted snow</l>
       <l n="8">At the sand edge ?</l>
       <l n="9">The sky was a light , high blue</l>
       <l n="10">And all the clouds were little , and frisky .</l>
       <l n="11">And we kept making wagers about the willows</l>
       <l n="12">At every curve in the road .</l>
       <l n="13">Darling ... the colour has come back in the willows ;</l>
       <l n="14">But I have no one ... to bet with !</l>

       <l n="56">And how we loved him ;</l>
       <l n="57">And how he ran just a little ahead of you ,</l>
       <l n="58">Just a little too fast</l>
       <l n="59">And you , chasing him on your tricycle ...</l>
       <l n="60">And the curb came ,</l>

       <l n="62">And Tip , did n't</l>

       <l n="65">And we tucked him away in a brown bean carton</l>
       <l n="66">Under the apple tree</l>
       <l n="67">And the house was awfully quiet without him ,</l>
       <l n="68">That was “ nostalgia ” .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="69">And remember when we did the Plays ,</l>
       <l n="70">And you were Wakefield in the Jalna one ,</l>
       <l n="71">And we used to prop up your lines over the basin in the bathroom ,</l>
       <l n="72">And you learned them while you brushed your teeth ;</l>
       <l n="73">And you followed me round the kitchen</l>
       <l n="74">While I made peanut butter cookies</l>
       <l n="75">And took the part of Renny</l>
       <l n="76">At the same time ...</l>
       <l n="77">And it was pretty exciting</l>
       <l n="78">And mixed up , and very wonderful ...</l>
       <l n="79">And the smell of make-up , remember that ?</l>
       <l n="80">And the keen edge of being treated like a grownup ...</l>
       <l n="81">And the first taste of applause</l>
       <l n="82">And the feeling of “ power ”</l>
       <l n="83">When you nip't your cue</l>
       <l n="84">Right on the nose ;</l>
       <l n="85">And then it was all over</l>
       <l n="86">And there were n't any more rehearsals ,</l>
       <l n="87">And all the excitement was quenched</l>
       <l n="88">And school seemed uncommonly dull</l>
       <l n="89">And one night you went back to the theatre</l>
       <l n="90">To get your little riding boots ,</l>
       <l n="91">And it was deserted and dusty .</l>
       <l n="92">But that lovely smell of make-up</l>
       <l n="93">Still lingered in the dressing-room ;</l>
       <l n="94">And you stood there for a minute</l>
       <l n="95">With one boot in your hand</l>
       <l n="96">And let it just “ roll ” over you ...</l>
       <l n="97">The Play ... the lights ... the fun ...</l>
       <l n="98">And then you gave yourself a little shake</l>
       <l n="99">And picked up the other boot ... and felt ... well ...</l>
       <l n="100">That was “ nostaglia ” !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="101">And then ... remember the time in the Union Station</l>
       <l n="102">And we 'd been down to Gammie 's together</l>
       <l n="103">Because Daddy was there ... on Last Leave ...</l>
       <l n="104">And he 'd met us at the train ,</l>
       <l n="105">And taken you to the Mess</l>
       <l n="106">And you 'd seen the Bunk , where he slept ,</l>
       <l n="107">And played a game of Darts ,</l>
       <l n="108">And had a Coke with him in the Canteen ,</l>
       <l n="109">And gone to a Movie</l>
       <l n="110">And felt very proud when we came out</l>
       <l n="111">Because your father looked so impressive in his uniform .</l>
       <l n="112">And because we 'd agreed there 'd be no fuss ,</l>
       <l n="113">No tears ... no last good-byes ...</l>
       <l n="114">Daddy had just said ,</l>
       <l n="115">“ So long , Sport ... I 'll see you in the Funny Papers ... ”</l>
       <l n="116">But for once</l>
       <l n="117">It was n't funny .</l>
       <l n="118">And you were still holding the little metal disc in your hand</l>
       <l n="119">Daddy had stamped out for you</l>
       <l n="120">With your name on it .</l>
       <l n="121">And you did n't seem to want to put it out of your hand</l>
       <l n="122">Not even in your pocket ;</l>
       <l n="123">And you looked at me across a great , black gap ...</l>
       <l n="124">And even I could n't fix it ... this time ...</l>
       <l n="125">And that was “ nostalgia ” !</l>

       <l n="4">Through the dark , cool earth that spreads above my head ,</l>

       <l n="6">Your kisses shall become inconsequent</l>
       <l n="7">As flowers and grass that grow above my grave ,</l>
       <l n="8">Our moments shared shall crumble down to dust ,</l>
       <l n="9">The ring upon my finger turn to rust .</l>
       <l n="10">There shall be nothing to remind me , then ,</l>
       <l n="11">I shall know peace , unstirred by pain or song ,</l>
       <l n="12">Turning my face to sleep , as children do ,</l>
       <l n="13">Never to start awake and cry your name ,</l>
       <l n="14">Seeking your arms to shelter me from fear</l>
