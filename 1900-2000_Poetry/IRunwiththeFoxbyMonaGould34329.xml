Printed in<country>Canada</country>by Le Soleil Limitee , Quebec . Frontespiece : For “ Mook ” ( Lt. - Col. Howard McTavish , Royal Canadian Engineers , killed in action , Dieppe ,<date>1942</date>) In proud and loving remembrance This was my brother At Dieppe , Quietly a hero Who gave his life Like a gift , Withholding nothing . His youth ... his Love ... His enjoyment of being alive ... His future , like a book With half the pages still uncut — This was my brother At Dieppe — The one who built me a doll house When I was seven , Complete to the last small picture frame , Nothing forgotten . He was awfully good at fixing things , At stepping into the breach when he was needed . That 's what he did at Dieppe ; He was needed . And even death must have been a little shamed At has eagerness .</docImprint>

     <p>I Run With the Fox</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Better to be proud and hunted</l>
       <l n="2">Than to ride with the Pink Coats .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Better than the smell of warm blood after a quick kill , Bitter and bright the scent of hidden fern .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Though the heart fail in the panting side</l>
       <l n="2">And the eye be clouded with straining</l>
       <l n="3">after the deep copse</l>
       <l n="4">Still is there thrill in flight —</l>
       <l n="5">Soft are oak leaves under the swift feet .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Sweet are the distant notes of the hunter 's horn And the hounds ’ baying , Sweet to the trembling ears of the hidden and hunted .</p>
     <p>I run with the fox !</p>
