   <note>Fine forms from Greece . l. 342 . In real stones , or in paste or soft coloured glass , many pieces of exquisite workmanship were produced by the antients . Basso-relievos of various sizes were made in coarse brown earth of one colour ; but of the improved kind of two or more colours , and of a true porcelain texture , none were made by the antients , nor attempted I believe by the moderns , before those of Mr. Wedgwood 's manufactory .</note>

   <note>Bright Amber shines . l. 353 . Coal has probably all been sublimed more or less from the clay , with which it was at first formed in decomposing morasses ; the petroleum seems to have been separated and condensed again in superior strata , and a still finer kind of oil , as naphtha , has probably had the same origin . Some of these liquid oils have again lost their more volatile parts , and become cannel-coal , asphaltum , jet , and amber , according to the purity of the original fossil oil . Dr. Priestley has shewn , that essential oils long exposed to the atmosphere absorb both the vital and phlogistic part of it ; whence it is probable their becoming solid may in great measure depend , as well as by the exhalation of their more volatile parts . On distillation with volatile alcaly all these fossil oils are shewn to contain the acid of amber , which evinces the identity of their origin . If a piece of amber be rubbed it attracts straws and hairs , whence the discovery of electricity , and whence its name , from electron the Greek word for amber .</note>

We saw the hooks of those chains , by which the prisoners were fastened by their necks to the walls of their cells ; many of which being below the level of the water were in a constant state of humidity ; from which issued a noxious vapour , which more than once extinguished the candles . Since the destruction of the building many subterraneous cells have been discovered under a piece of ground , which seemed only a bank of solid earth before the horrid secrets of this prison-house were disclosed . Some skeletons were found in these recesses with irons still fastened to their decayed bones . ” Letters from France , by H. M. Williams , p. 24 .</note>

     <l n="6">400 And bear phlogiston on their tepid wing .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>[ And pierce the rent roof . l. 398 . The granite rocks and the limestone rocks have been cracked to very great depths at the time they were raised up by subterranean fires ; in these cracks are found most of the metallic ores , except iron and perhaps manganese , the former of which is generally found in horizontal strata , and the latter generally near the surface of the earth .</p>
   <p>Philosophers possessing so convenient a test for the discovery of iron by the magnet , have long since found it in all vegetable and animal matters ; and of late Mr. Scheele has discovered the existence of manganese in vegetable ashes . Scheele , 56 mem . Stock . 1774 . Kirwan . Min . 353 . Which accounts for the production of it near the surface of earth , and thence for its calciform appearance , or union with vital air . Bergman has likewise shewn , that the limestones which become bluish or dark coloured when calcined , possess a mixture of manganese , and are thence preferable as a cement to other kinds of lime . 2 . Bergman , 229 . Which impregnation with manganese has probably been received from the decomposition of superincumbent vegetable matters .</p>
   <p>These cracks or perpendicular caverns in the granite or limestone pass to unknown depths ; and it is up these channels that I have endeavoured to shew that the steam rises which becomes afterwards condensed and produces the warm springs of this island , and other parts of the world . ( See note on Fucus , Vol . II . ) And up these cracks I suppose certain vapours arise , which either alone , or by meeting with something descending into them from above , have produced most of the metals ; and several of the materials in which they are bedded . Thus the ponderous earth , Barytes , of Derbyshire , is found in these cracks , and is stratified frequently with lead-ore , and frequently surrounds it . This ponderous earth has been found by Dr. Hoepfner in a granite in Switzerland , and may have thus been sublimed from immense depths by great heat , and have obtained its carbonic or vitriolic acid from above . Annales de Chimie . There is also reason to conclude that something from above is necessary to the formation of many of the metals : at Hawkstone in Shropshire , the seat of Sir Richard Hill , there is an elevated rock of siliceous sand which is coloured green with copper in many places high in the air ; and I have in my possession a specimen of lead formed in the cavity of an iron nodule , and another of lead amid spar from a crack of a coal-stratum ; all which countenance the modern production of those metals from descending materials . To which should be added , that the highest mountains of granite , which have therefore probably never been covered with marine productions on account of their early elevation , nor with vegetable or animal matters on account of their great coldness , contain no metallic ores , whilst the lower ones contain copper and tin in their cracks or veins , both in Saxony , Silesia , and Cornwall . Kirwan 's Mineral . p. 374 .</p>
   <p>The transmutation of one metal into another , though hitherto undiscovered by the alchymists , does not appear impossible ; such transmutations have been supposed to exist in nature , thus lapis calaminaris may have been produced from the destruction of lead-ore , as it is generally found on the top of the veins of lead , where it has been calcined or united with air , and because masses of lead-ore are often found intirely inclosed in it . So silver is found mixed in almost all lead-ores , and sometimes in seperate filaments within the cavities of lead-ore , as I am informed by Mr. Michell , and is thence probably a partial transmutation of the lead to silver , the rapid progress of modern chemistry having shewn the analogy between metallic calces and acids , may lead to the power of transmuting their bases : a discovery much to be wished . ]</p>

And has endeavoured from thence to shew , that , when a monarch died , several of his favourite courtiers were inclosed alive with the mummy in these great masses of stone-work ; and had food and water conveyed to them , as long as they lived , proper apertures being left for this purpose , and for the admission of air , and for the exclusion of any thing offensive .</note>

   <p>[ And stalking turrets . l. 478 . “ At one o'clock we alighted among some acacia trees at Waadi el Halboub , having gone twenty-one miles . We were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely one of the most magnificent in the world . In that vast expanse of desert , from W. to N. W . of us , we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances , at times moving with great celerity , at others stalking on with a majestic slowness ; at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us ; and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us . Again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight , their tops reaching to the very clouds . There the tops often separated from the bodies ; and these , once disjoined , dispersed in the air , and did not appear more . Sometimes they were broken in the middle , as if struck with large cannon-shot . About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us , the wind being very strong at north . Eleven of them ranged along side of us about the distance of three miles . The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure ten feet . They retired from us with a wind at S. E . leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name , though surely one ingredient in it was fear , with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment . It was in vain to think of flying ; the swiftest horse , or fastest sailing ship , could be of no use to carry us out of this danger ; and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where I stood .</p>
   <p>“ The same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to us this day in form and disposition like those we had seen at Waadi Halboub , only they seemed to be more in number and less in size . They came several times in a direction close upon us , that is , I believe , within less than two miles . They began immediately after sun rise like a thick wood and almost darkened the sun . His rays shining through them for near an hour , gave them an appearance of pillars of fire . Our people now became desperate , the Greeks shrieked out and said it was the day of judgment ; Ismael pronounced it to be hell ; and the Turcorories , that the world was on fire . ” Bruce 's Travels , Vol . IV . p. 553 , - 555 .</p>
   <p>From this account it would appear , that the eddies of wind were owing to the long range of broken rocks , which bounded one side of the sandy desert , and bent the currents of air , which struck against their sides ; and were thus like the eddies in a stream of water , which falls against oblique obstacles . This explanation is probably the true one , as these whirl-winds were not attended with rain or lightening like the tornadoes of the West-Indies . ]</p>

   <note>The granite-cliffs . l. 523 . On long exposure to air the granites or porphories of this country exhibit a ferrugenous crust , the iron being calcined by the air first becomes visible , and is then washed away from the external surface , which becomes white or grey , and thus in time seems to decompose . The marbles seem to decompose by loosing their carbonic acid , as the outside , which has been long exposed to the air , does not seem to effervesce so hastily with acids as the parts more recently broken . The immense quantity of carbonic acid , which exists in the many provinces of lime-stone , if it was extricated and decomposed would afford charcoal enough for fuel for ages , or for the production of new vegetable or animal bodies . The volcanic slaggs on Mount Vesuvius are said by M. Ferber to be changed into clay by means of the sulphur - acid , and even pots made of clay and burnt or vitrified are said by him to be again reducible to ductile clay by the volcanic steams . Ferber 's Travels through Italy , p. 166 .</note>
   <note>Wooden wedges wound . l. 524 . It is usual in seperating large mill - stones from the siliceous sand-rocks in some parts of Derbyshire to bore horizontal holes under them in a circle , and fill these with pegs made of dry wood , which gradually swell by the moisture of the earth , and in a day or two lift up the mill-stone without breaking it .</note>
   <note>With fires and acids . l. 534 . Hannibal was said to erode his way over the Alps by fire and vinegar . The latter is supposed to allude to the vinegar and water which was the beverage of his army . In respect to the former it is not improbable , but where wood was to be had in great abundance , that fires made round limestone precipices would calcine them to a considerable depth , the night-dews or mountain-mists would penetrate these calcined parts and pulverize them by the force of the steam which the generated heat would produce , the winds would disperse this lime-powder , and thus by repeated fires a precipice of lime-stone might be destroyed and a passage opened . It should be added , that according to Ferber 's observations , these Alps consist of lime-stone . Letters from Italy .</note>

   <p>[ Mould with retractile glue . l. 567 . The constituent parts of animal fibres are believed to be earth and gluten . These do not seperate except by long putrefaction or by fire . The earth then effervesces with acids , and can only be converted into glass by the greatest force of fire . The gluten has continued united with the earth of the bones above 2000 years in Egyptian mummies ; but by long exposure to air or moisture it diffolves and leaves only the earth . Hence bones long buried , when exposed to the air , absorb moisture and crumble into powder . Phil . Trans . No . 475 . The retractibility or elasticity of the animal fibre depends on the gluten ; and of these fibres are composed the membranes muscles and bones . Haller . Physiol . Tom . I , p. 2 .</p>
   <p>For the chemical decomposition of animal and vegetable bodies see the ingenious work of Lavoisier , Traité de Chimie , Tom . I. p. 132. who resolves all their component parts into oxygene , hydrogene , carbone , and azote , the three former of which belong principally to vegetable and the last to animal matter . ]</p>
   <p>[ The transmigrating Ens . l. 574 , The perpetual circulation of matter in the growth and dissolution of vegetable and animal bodies seems to have given Pythagoras his idea of the metempsycosis or transmigration of spirit ; which was afterwards dressed out or ridiculed in variety of amusing fables . Other philosophers have supposed , that there are two different materials or essences , which fill the universe . One of these , which has the power of commencing or producing motion , is called spirit ; the other , which has the power of receiving and of communicating motion , but not of beginning it , is called matter . The former of these is supposed to be diffused through all space , filling up the interstices of the suns and planets , and constituting the gravitations of the sidereal bodies , the attractions of chemistry , with the spirit of vegetation , and of animation . The latter occupies comparatively but small space , constituting the solid parts of the suns and planets , and their atmospheres . Hence these philosophers have supposed , that both matter and spirit are equally immortal and unperishable ; and that on the dissolution of vegetable or animal organization , the matter returns to the general mass of matter ; and the spirit to the general mass of spirit , to enter again into new combinations , according to the original idea of Pythagoras .</p>
   <p>The small apparent quantity of matter that exists in the universe compared to that of spirit , and the short time in which the recrements of animal or vegetable bodies become again vivified in the forms of vegetable mucor or microscopic insects , seems to have given rise to another curious fable of antiquity . That Jupiter threw down a large handful of souls upon the earth , and left them to scramble for the few bodies which were to be had . ]</p>

   <p>[ Adonis . l. 576 . The very antient story of the beautiful Adonis passing one half of the year with Venus , and the other with Proserpine alternately , has had variety of interpretations . Some have supposed that it allegorized the summer and winter solstice ; but this seems too obvious a fact to have needed an hieroglyphic emblem . Others have believed it to represent the corn , which was supposed to sleep in the earth during the winter months , and to rise out of it in summer . This does not accord with the climate of Egypt , where the harvest soon follows the seed-time .</p>
   <p>It seems more probably to have been a story explaining some hieroglyphic figures representing the decomposition and resuscitation of animal matter ; a sublime and interesting subject , and which seems to have given origin to the doctrine of the transmigration , which had probably its birth also from the hieroglyphic treasures of Egypt . It is remarkable that the cypress groves in the ancient greek writers , as in Theocritus , were dedicated to Venus ; and afterwards became funereal emblems . Which was probably occasioned by the Cypress being an accompaniment of Venus in the annual processions , in which she was supposed to lament over the funeral of Adonis ; a ceremony which obtained over all the eastern world from great antiquity , and is supposed to be referred to by Ezekiel , who accuses the idolatrous woman of weeping for Thammus . ]</p>

   <p>but were altered on account of the supposed false grammar in using the word drove for driven , according to the opinion of Dr. Lowth : at the same time it may be observed , 1. that this is in many cases only an ellipsis of the letter n at the end of the word ; as froze , for frozen ; wove , for woven ; spoke , for spoken ; and that then the participle accidentally becomes similar to the past tense : 2. that the language seems gradually tending to omit the letter n in other kind of words for the sake of euphony ; as housen is become houses ; eyne , eyes ; thine , thy , &amp; c. and in common conversation , the words forgot , spoke , froze , rode , are frequently used for forgotten , spoken , frozen , ridden . 3 . It does not appear that any confusion would follow the indiscriminate use of the same word for the past tense and the participle passive , since the auxiliary verb have , or the preceding noun or pronoun always clearly distinguishes them : and lastly , rhime-poetry must lose the use of many elegant words without this license . ]</p>

   </lg>
   <p>[ On each broad cloud . l. 15 . The clouds consist of condensed vapour , the particles of which are too small separately to overcome the tenacity of the air , and which therefore do not descend . They are in such small spheres as to repel each other , that is , they are applied to each other by such very small surfaces , that the attraction of the particles of each drop to its own centre is greater than its attraction to the surface of the drop in its vicinity ; every one has observed with what difficulty small spherules of quicksilver can be made to unite , owing to the same cause ; and it is common to see on riding through shallow water on a clear day , numbers of very small spheres of water as they are thrown from the horses feet run along the surface for many yards before they again unite with it . In many cases these spherules of water , which compose clouds , are kept from uniting by a surplus of electric fluid ; and fall in violent showers as soon as that is withdrawn from them , as in thunder storms . See note on Canto I. l. 553 .</p>
   <p>If in this state a cloud becomes frozen , it is torn to pieces in its descent by the friction of the air , and falls in white flakes of snow . Or these flakes are rounded by being rubbed together by the winds , and by having their angles thawed off by the warmer air beneath as they descend ; and part of the water produced by these angles thus dissolved is absorbed into the body of the hailstone , as may be seen by holding a lump of snow over a candle , and there becomes frozen into ice by the quantity of cold which the hailstone possesses beneath the freezing point , or which is produced by its quick evaporation in falling ; and thus hailstones are often found of greater or less density according as they consist of a greater portion of snow or ice . If hailstones consisted of the large drops of showers frozen in their descent , they would consist of pure transparent ice .</p>
   <p>As hail is only produced in summer , and is always attended with storms , some philosophers have believed that the sudden departure of electricity from a cloud may effect something yet unknown in this phenomenon ; but it may happen in summer independent of electricity , because the aqueous vapour is then raised higher in the atmosphere , whence it has further to fall , and there is warmer air below for it to fall through . ]</p>
   <note>Or sink in silver dews . l. 18 . During the coldness of the night the moisture before dissolved in the air is gradually precipitated , and as it subsides adheres to the bodies it falls upon . Where the attraction of the body to the particles of water is greater than the attractions of those particles to each other , it becomes spread upon their surface , or slides down them in actual contact ; as on the broad parts of the blades of moist grass : where the attraction of the surface to the water is less than the attraction of the particles of water to each other , the dew stands in drops ; as on the points and edges of grass or gorse , where the surface presented to the drop being small it attracts it so little as but just to support it without much changing its globular form : where there is no attraction between the vegetable surface and the dew drops , as on cabbage leaves , the drop does not come into contact with the leaf , but hangs over it repelled , and retains it natural form , composed of the attraction and pressure of its own parts , and thence looks like quicksilver , reflecting light from both its surfaces . Nor is this owing to any oiliness of the leaf , but simply to the polish of its surface , as a light needle may be laid on water in the same manner without touching it ; for as the attractive powers of polished surfaces are greater when in actual contact , so the repulsive power is greater before contact .</note>
   <p>[ The blue mist . l. 20 . Mists are clouds resting on the ground , they generally come on at the beginning of night , and either fill the moist vallies , or hang on the summits of hills , according to the degree of moisture previously dissolved , and the eduction of heat from them . The air over rivers during the warmth of the day suspends much moisture , and as the changeful surface of rivers occasions them to cool sooner than the land at the approach of evening , mists are most frequently seen to begin over rivers , and to spread themselves over moist grounds , and fill the vallies , while the mists on the tops of mountains are more properly clouds , condensed by the coldness of their situation .</p>
   <p>On ascending up the side of a hill from a misty valley , I have observed a beautiful coloured halo round the moon when a certain thickness of mist was over me , which ceased to be visible as soon as I emerged out of it ; and well remember admiring with other spectators the shadow of the three spires of the cathedral church at Lichfield , the moon rising behind it , apparently broken off , and lying distinctly over our heads as if horizontally on the surface of the mist , which arose about as high as the roof of the church . There are some curious remarks on shadows or reflexions seen on the surface of mists from high mountains in Ulloa 's Voyages . The dry mist of summer 1783 , was probably occasioned by volcanic eruption , as mentioned in note on Chunda , Vol . II . and therefore more like the atmosphere of smoke which hangs on still days over great cities .</p>
   <p>There is a dry mist , or rather a diminished transparence of the air , which according to Mr. Saussure accompanies fair weather , while great transparence of air indicates rain . Thus when large rivers two miles broad , such as at Liverpool , appear narrow , it is said to prognosticate rain ; and when wide , fair weather . This want of transparence of the air in dry weather , may be owing to new combinations or decompositions of the vapours dissolved in it , but wants further investigation .

   <p>[ Car 'd on the foam . l. 61 . The phenomena of the tides have been well investigated and satisfactorily explained by Sir Isaac Newton and Dr. Halley from the reciprocal gravitations of the earth , moon , and sun . As the earth and moon move round a centre of motion near the earth 's surface , at the same time that they are proceeding in their annual orbit round the sun , it follows that the water on the side of the earth nearest this centre of motion between the earth and moon will be more attracted by the moon , and the waters on the opposite side of the earth will be less attracted by the moon , than the central parts of the earth . Add to this that the centrifugal force of the water on the side of the earth furthest from the centre of the motion , round which the earth and moon move , ( which , as was said before , is near the surface of the earth ) is greater than that on the opposite side of the earth . From both these causes it is easy to comprehend that the water will rise on two sides of the earth , viz . on that nearest to the moon , and its opposite side , and that it will be flattened in consequence at the quadratures , and thus produce two tides in every lunar day , which consists of about twenty - four hours and forty-eight minutes .</p>
   <p>These tides will be also affected by the solar attraction when it coincides with the lunar one , or opposes it , as at new and full moon , and will also be much influenced by the opposing shores in every part of the earth .</p>
   <p>Now as the moon in moving round the centre of gravity between itself and the earth describes a much larger orbit than the earth describes round the same centre , it follows that the centrifugal motion on the side of the moon opposite to the earth must be much greater than the centrifugal motion of the side of the earth opposite to the moon round the same centre . And secondly , as the attraction of the earth exerted on the moon 's surface next to the earth is much greater than the attraction of the moon exerted on the earth 's surface , the tides on the lunar sea , ( if such there be ,) should be much greater than those of our ocean . Add to this that as the same face of the moon always is turned to the earth , the lunar tides must be permanent , and if the solid parts of the moon be spherical , must always cover the phasis next to us . But as there are evidently hills and vales and volcanos on this side of the moon , the consequence is that the moon has no ocean , or that it is frozen . ]</p>

   <p>[ The gaudy conch . l. 66 . The spiral form of many shells seem to have afforded a more frugal manner of covering the long tail of the fish with calcareous armour ; since a single thin partition between the adjoining circles of the fish was sufficient to defend both surfaces , and thus much cretaceous matter is saved ; and it is probable that from this spiral form they are better enabled to feel the vibrations of the element in which they exist . See note on Canto IV . l. 162 . This cretaceous matter is formed by a mucous secretion from the skin of the fish , as is seen in crab-fish , and others which annually cast their shells , and is at first a soft mucous covering , ( like that of a hen 's egg , when it is laid a day or two too soon ,) and which gradually hardens . This may also be seen in common shell snails , if a part of their shell be broken it becomes repaired in a similar manner with mucus , which by degrees hardens into shell .</p>
   <p>It is probable the calculi or stones found in other animals may have a similar origin , as they are formed on mucous membranes , as those of the kidney and bladder , chalk-stones in the gout , and gall-stones ; and are probably owing to the inflammation of the membrane where they are produced , and vary according to the degree of inflammation of the membrane which forms them , and the kind of mucous which it naturally produces . Thus the shelly matter of different shell-fish differs , from the courser kinds which form the shells of crabs , to the finer kinds which produces the mother-pearl .</p>
   <p>The beautiful colours of some shells originate from the thinness of the laminae of which they consist , rather than to any colouring matter , as is seen in mother-pearl , which reflects different colours according to the obliquity of the light which falls on it . The beautiful prismatic colours seen on the Labrodore stone are owing to a similar cause , viz . the thinness of the laminae of which it consists , and has probably been formed from mother-pearl shells .</p>
   <p>It is curious that some of the most common fossil shells are not now known in their recent state , as the cornua ammonis ; and on the contrary , many shells which are very plentiful in their recent state , as limpets , sea-ears , volutes , cowries , are very rarely found fossil . Da Costa 's Conchology , p. 163 . Were all the ammoniae destroyed when the continents were raised ? Or do some genera of animals perish by the increasing power of their enemies ? Or do they still reside at inaccessible depths in the sea ? Or do some animals change their forms gradually and become new genera ? ]</p>

   <note>And drop a pearl . l. 84 . Many are the opinions both of antient and modern concerning the production of pearls . Mr. Reaumur thinks they are formed like the hard concretions in many land animals as stones of the bladder , gallstones , and bezoar , and hence concludes them to be a disease of the fish , but there seems to be a stricter analogy between these and the calcareous productions found in crab-fish called crab 's eyes , which are formed near the stomach of the animal , and constitute a reservoir of calcareous matter against the renovation of the shell , at which time they are re-dissolved and deposited for that purpose . As the internal part of the shell of the pearl oyster or muscle consists of mother-pearl which is a similar material to the pearl and as the animal has annually occasion to enlarge his shell there is reason to suspect the loose pearls are similar reservoirs of the pearly matter for that purpose .</note>

   <p>[ Heave the vast spars . l. 116 . Water in descending down elevated situations if the outlet for it below is not sufficient for its emission acts with a force equal to the height of the column , as is seen in an experimental machine called the philosophical bellows , in which a few pints of water are made to raise many hundred pounds . To this cause is to be ascribed many large promontories of ice being occasionally thrown down from the glaciers ; rocks have likewise been thrown from the sides of mountains by the same cause , and large portions of earth have been removed many hundred yards from their situations at the foot of mountains . On inspecting the locomotion of about thirty acres of earth with a small house near Bilder 's Bridge in Shropshire , about twenty years ago , from the foot of a mountain towards the river , I well remember it bore all the marks of having been thus lifted up , pushed away , and as it were crumpled into ridges , by a column of water contained in the mountain .</p>
   <p>From water being thus confined in high columns between the strata of mountainous countries it has often happened that when wells or perforations have been made into the earth , that springs have arisen much above the surface of the new well . When the new bridge was building at Dublin Mr. G. Semple found a spring in the bed of the river where he meant to lay the foundation of a pierre , which , by fixing iron pipes into it , he raised many feet . Treatise on Building in Water , by G. Semple . From having observed a valley north-west of St. Alkmond 's well near Derby , at the head of which that spring of water once probably existed , and by its current formed the valley , ( but which in after times found its way out in its present situation ,) I suspect that St. Alkmond 's well might by building round it be raised high enough to supply many streets in Derby with spring-water which are now only supplied with river-water . See an account of an artificial spring of water , Phil . Trans . Vol . LXXV . p. 1 .</p>
   <p>In making a well at Sheerness the water rose 300 feet above its source in the well . Phil . Trans . Vol . LXXIV . And at Hartford in Connecticut there is a well which was dug seventy feet deep before water was found , then in boring an augur-hole through a rock the water rose so fast as to make it difficult to keep it dry by pumps till they could blow the hole larger by gunpowder , which was no sooner accomplished than it filled and run over , and has been a brook for near a century .

   <p>[ Dark monsoon inshrouds . l. 129 . When from any peculiar situations of land in respect to sea the tropic becomes more heated , when the sun is vertical over it , than the line , the periodical winds called monsoons are produced , and these are attended by rainy seasons ; for as the air at the tropic is now more heated than at the line it ascends by decrease of its specific gravity , and floods of air rush in both from the South West and North East , and these being one warmer than the other the rain is precipitated by their mixture as observed by Dr. Hutton . See additional notes , No . XXV . All late travellers have ascribed the rise of the Nile to the monsoons which deluge Nubia and Abyssinia with rain . The whirling of the ascending air was even seen by Mr. Bruce in Abyssinia ; he says , “ every morning a small cloud began to whirl round , and presently after the whole heavens became covered with clouds , ” by this vortex of ascending air the N. E . winds and the S. W . winds , which flow in to supply the place of the ascending column , became mixed more rapidly and deposited their rain in greater abundance .</p>
   <p>Mr. Volney observes that the time of the rising of the Nile commences about the 19th of June , and that Abyssinia and the adjacent parts of Africa are deluged with rain in May , June , and July , and produce a mass of water which is three months in draining off . The Abbe Le Pluche observes that as Sirius , or the dog-star , rose at the time of the commencement of the flood its rising was watched by the astronomers , and notice given of the approach of inundation by hanging the figure of Anubis , which was that of a man with a dog 's head , upon all their temples .

   <note>Egypt 's shower-less lands . l. 138 . There seem to be two situations which may be conceived to be exempted from rain falling upon them , one where the constant trade-winds meet beneath the line , for here two regions of warm air are mixed together , and thence do not seem to have any cause to precipitate their vapour ; and the other is , where the winds are brought from colder climates and become warmer by their contact with the earth of a warmer one . Thus Lower Egypt is a flat country warmed by the sun more than the higher lands of one side of it , and than the Mediterranean on the other ; and hence the winds which blow over it acquire greater warmth , which ever way they come , than they possessed before , and in consequence have a tendency to acquire and not to part with their vapour like the north-east winds of this country . There is said to be a narrow spot upon the coast of Peru where rain seldom occurs , at the same time according to Ulloa on the mountainous regions of the Andes beyond there is almost perpetual rain . For the wind blows uniformly upon this hot part of the coast of Peru , but no cause of devaporation occurs till it begins to ascend the mountainous Andes , and then its own expansion produces cold sufficient to condense its vapour .</note>

On cooling it deposited a siliceous matter or chalcedony forming a bason round its base . The heat of this water before it rose out of the earth could not be ascertained , as water looses all its heat above 212 ( as soon as it is at liberty to expand ) by the exhalation of a part , but the flinty bason which is deposited from it shews that water with great degrees of heat will dissolve siliceous matter . Van Troil 's Letters on Iceland . Since the above account in the year 1780 this part of Iceland has been destroyed by an earthquake or covered with lava , which was probably effected by the force of aqueous steam , a greater quantity of water falling on the subterraneous fires than could escape by the antient outlets and generating an increased quantity of vapour .

   <note>And sob , their blue eyes . l. 184 . The bath at Buxton being of 82 degrees of heat is called a warm bath , and is so compared with common spring-water which possesses but 48 degrees of heat , but is nevertheless a cold bath compared to the heat of the body which is 98 . On going into this bath there is therefore always a chill perceived at the first immersion , but after having been in it a minute the chill ceases and a sensation of warmth succeeds though the body continues to be immersed in the water . The cause of this curious phenomenon is to be looked for in the laws of animal sensation and not from any properties of heat . When a person goes from clear day-light into an obscure room for a while it appears gloomy , which gloom however in a little time ceases , and the deficiency of light becomes no longer perceived . This is not solely owing to the enlargement of the iris of the eye , since that is performed in an instant , but to this law of sensation , that when a less stimulus is applied ( within certain bounds ) the sensibility increases . Thus at going into a bath as much colder than the body as that of Buxton , the diminution of heat on the skin is at first perceived , but in about a minute the sensibility to heat increases and the nerves of the skin are equally excited by the lessened stimulus . The sensation of warmth at emerging from a cold-bath , and the pain called the hot-ach , after the hands have been immersed in snow , depend on the same principle , viz . the increased sensibility of the skin after having been previously exposed to a stimulus less than usual .</note>

   <note>And to pure air . l. 204 . Until very lately water was esteemed a simple element , nor are all the most celebrated chemists of Europe yet converts to the new opinion of its decomposition . Mr. Lavoisier and others of the French school have most ingeniously endeavoured to shew that water consists of pure air , called by them oxygene , and of inflammable air , called hydrogene , with as much of the matter of heat , or calorique , as is necessary to preserve them in the form of gas . Gas is distinguished from steam by its preserving its elasticity under the pressure of the atmosphere , and in the greatest degrees of cold yet known . The history of the progress of this great discovery is detailed in the Memoires of the Royal Academy for 1781 , and the experimental proofs of it are delivered in Lavoisier 's Elements of Chemistry . The results of which are that water consists of eighty-five parts by weight of oxygene , and fifteen parts by weight of hydrogene , with a sufficient quantity of Calorique . Not only numerous chemical phenomena , but many atmospherical and vegetable facts receive clear and beautiful elucidation from this important analysis . In the atmosphere inflammable air is probably perpetually uniting with vital air and producing moisture which descends in dews and showers , while the growth of vegetables by the assistance of light is perpetually again decomposing the water they imbibe from the earth , and while they retain the inflammable air for the formation of oils , wax , honey , resin , &amp; c. they give up the vital air to replenish the atmosphere .</note>

The allegorical interpretation of the very antient mythology which supposes Jupiter to represent the superior part of the atmosphere or ether , and Juno the inferior air , and that the conjunction of these two produces vernal showers , as alluded to in Virgil 's Georgics , is so analogous to the present important discovery of the production of water from pure air , or oxygene , and inflammable air , or hydrogene , ( which from its greater levity probably resides over the former ,) that one should be tempted to believe that the very antient chemists of Egypt had discovered the composition of water , and thus represented it in their hieroglyphic figures before the invention of letters .</p>

   <note>Lift her ponderous waves . l. 366 . The invention of the pump is of very antient date , being ascribed to one Ctesebes an Athenian , whence it was called by the Latins machina Ctesebiana ; but it was long before it was known that the ascent of the piston lifted the superincumbent column of the atmosphere , and that then the pressure of the surrounding air on the surface of the well below forced the water up into the vacuum , and that on that account in the common lifting pump the water would rise only about thirty-five feet , as the weight of such a column of water was in general an equipoise to the surrounding atmosphere . The foamy appearance of water , when the pressure of the air over it is diminished , is owing to the expansion and escape of the air previously dissolved by it , or existing in its pores . When a child first sucks it only presses or champs the teat , as observed by the great Harvey , but afterwards it learns to make an incipient vacuum in its mouth , and acts by removing the pressure of the atmosphere from the nipple , like a pump .</note>

The addition of an air-cell to machines for raising water to extinguish fire was first introduced by Mr. Newsham of London , and is now applied to similar engines for washing wall-trees in gardens , and to all kinds of forcing pumps , and might be applied with advantage to lifting pumps where the water is brought from a great distance horizontally . Another kind of machine was invented by one Greyl , in which a vessel of water was every way dispersed by the explosion of gun-powder lodging in the centre of it , and lighted by an adapted match ; from this idea Mr. Godfrey proposed a water-bomb of similar construction . Dr. Hales to prevent the spreading of fire proposed to cover the floors and stairs of the adjoining houses with earth ; Mr. Hartley proposed to prevent houses from taking fire by covering the cieling with thin iron-plates , and Lord Mahon by a bed of coarse mortar or plaister between the cieling and floor above it . May not this age of chemical science discover some method of injecting or soaking timber with lime-water and afterwards with vitriolic acid , and thus fill its pores with alabaster ? or of penetrating it with siliceous matter , by processes similar to those of Bergman and Achard ?

   <note>From each chill leaf . l. 459 . The upper side of the leaf is the organ of vegetable respiration , as explained in the additional notes , No . XXXVII , hence the leaf is liable to injury from much moisture on this surface , and is destroyed by being smeared with oil , in these respects resembling the lungs of animals or the spiracula of insects . To prevent these injuries some leaves repel the dew-drops from their upper surfaces as those of cabbages ; other vegetables close the upper surfaces of their leaves together in the night or in wet weather , as the sensitive plant ; others only hang their leaves downwards so as to shoot the wet from them , as kidney-beans , and many trees . See note on l. 18 of this Canto .</note>
   <p>[ Golden bell . l. 460 . There are muscles placed about the footstalks of the leaves or leaflets of many plants , for the purpose of closing their upper surfaces together , or of bending them down so as to shoot off the showers or dew-drops , as mentioned in the preceeding note . The claws of the petals or of the divisions of the calyx of many flowers are furnished in a similar manner with muscles , which are exerted to open or close the corol and calyx of the flower as in tragopogon , anemone . This action of opening and closing the leaves or flowers does not appear to be produced simply by irritation on the muscles themselves , but by the connection of those muscles with a sensitive sensorium or brain existing in each individual bud or flower . 1st . Because many flowers close from the defect of stimulus , not by the excess of it , as by darkness , which is the absence of the stimulus of light ; or by cold , which is the absence of the stimulus of heat . Now the defect of heat , or the absence of food , or of drink , affects our sensations , which had been previously accustomed to a greater quantity of them ; but a muscle cannot be said to be stimulated into action by a defect of stimulus . 2 . Because the muscles around the footstalks of the subdivisions of the leaves of the sensitive plant are exerted when any injury is offered to the other extremity of the leaf , and some of the stamens of the flowers of the class Syngenesia contract themselves when others are irritated . See note on Chondrilla , Vol . II . of this work .</p>
   <p>From this circumstance the contraction of the muscles of vegetables seems to depend on a disagreeable sensation in some distant part , and not on the irritation of the muscles themselves . Thus when a particle of dust stimulates the ball of the eye , the eye-lids are instantly closed , and when too much light pains the retina , the muscles of the iris contract its aperture , and this not by any connection or consent of the nerves of those parts , but as an effort to prevent or to remove a disagreeable sensation , which evinces that vegetables are endued with sensation , or that each bud has a common sensorium , and is furnished with a brain or a central place where its nerves were connected . ]</p>

   <p>[ Spread the bright treasure . l. 540 . The practice of flooding lands long in use in China has been but lately introduced into this country . Besides the supplying water to the herbage in dryer seasons , it seems to defend it from frost in the early part of the year , and thus doubly advances the vegetation . The waters which rise from springs passing through marl or limestone are replete with calcareous earth , and when thrown over morasses they deposit this earth and incrust or consolidate the morass . This kind of earth is deposited in great quantity from the springs at Matlock bath , and supplies the soft porous limestone of which the houses and walls are there constructed ; and has formed the whole bank for near a mile on that side of the Derwent on which they stand .</p>
   <p>The water of many springs contains much azotic gas , or phlogistic air , besides carbonic gas , or fixed air , as that of Buxton and Bath ; this being set at liberty may more readily contribute to the production of nitre by means of the putrescent matters which it is exposed to by being spread upon the surface of the land ; in the same manner as frequently turning over heaps of manure facilitates the nitrous process by imprisoning atmospheric air in the interstices of the putrescent materials . Water arising by land-floods brings along with it much of the most soluble parts of the manure from the higher lands to the lower ones . River-water in its clear state and those springs which are called soft are less beneficial for the purpose of watering lands , as they contain less earthy or saline matter ; and water from dissolving snow from its slow solution brings but little earth along with it , as may be seen by the comparative clearness of the water of snow-floods . ]</p>

   <note>Cacalia opens . l. 2 . The importance of the nectarium or honey-gland in the vegetable economy is seen from the very complicated apparatus , which nature has formed in some flowers for the preservation of their honey from insects , as in the aconites or monkshoods ; in other plants instead of a great apparatus for its protection a greater secretion of it is produced that thence a part may be spared to the depredation of insects . The cacalia suaveolens produces so much honey that on some days it may be smelt at a great distance from the plant . I remember once counting on one of these plants besides bees of various kinds without number , above two hundred painted butterflies , which gave it the beautiful appearance of being covered with additional flowers .</note>

   <p>[ The enamour 'd oxygene . l. 34 . The common air of the atmosphere appears by the analysis of Dr. Priestley and other philosophers to consist of about three parts of an elastic fluid unfit for respiration or combustion , called azote by the French school , and about one fourth of pure vital air fit for the support of animal life and of combustion , called oxygene . The principal source of the azote is probably from the decomposition of all vegetable and animal matters by putrefaction and combustion ; the principal source of vital air or oxygene is perhaps from the decomposition of water in the organs of vegetables by means of the sun 's light . The difficulty of injecting vegetable vessels seems to shew that their perspirative pores are much less than those of animals , and that the water which constitutes their perspiration is so divided at the time of its exclusion that by means of the sun 's light it becomes decomposed , the inflammable air or hydrogene , which is one of its constituent parts , being retained to form the oil , resin , wax , honey , &amp; c. of the vegetable economy ; and the other part , which united with light or heat becomes vital air or oxygene gas , rises into the atmosphere and replenishes it with the food of life .</p>
   <p>Dr. Priestley has evinced by very ingenious experiments that the blood gives out phlogiston , and receives vital air , or oxygene-gas by the lungs . And Dr. Crawford has shewn that the blood acquires heat from this vital air in respiration . There is however still a something more subtil than heat , which must be obtained in respiration from the vital air , a something which life can not exist a few minutes without , which seems necessary to the vegetable as well as to the animal world , and which as no organized vessels can confine it , requires perpetually to be renewed .

   <p>[ Arrest Simoom . l. 65 . “ At eleven o'clock while we were with great pleasure contemplating the rugged tops of Chiggre , where we expected to solace ourselves with plenty of good water , Idris cried out with a loud voice , “ fall upon your faces , for here is the simoom ! ” I saw from the S. E . a haze come in colour like the purple part of a rainbow , but not so compressed or thick ; it did not occupy twenty yards in breadth , and was about twelve feet high from the ground . It was a kind of a blush upon the air , and it moved very rapidly , for I scarce could turn to fall upon the ground with my head to the northward , when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon my face . We all lay flat upon the ground , as if dead , till Idris told us it was blown over . The meteor , or purple haze , which I saw was indeed passed ; but the light air that still blew was of heat to threaten suffocation . For my part I found distinctly in my breast , that I had imbibed a part of it ; nor was I free of an asthmatic sensation till I had been some months in Italy . ” Bruce 's Travels . Vol . IV . p. 557 .</p>
   <p>It is difficult to account for the narrow track of this pestilential wind , which is said not to exceed twenty yards , and for its small elevation of twelve feet . A whirlwind will pass forwards , and throw down an avenue of trees by its quick revolution as it passes , but nothing like a whirling is described as happening in these narrow streams of air , and whirlwinds ascend to greater heights . There seems but one known manner in which this channel of air could be effected , and that is by electricity .</p>
   <p>The volcanic origin of these winds is mentioned in the note on Chunda in Vol . II . of this work ; it must here be added , that Professor Vairo at Naples found , that during the eruption of Vesuvius perpendicular iron bars were electric ; and others have observed suffocating damps to attend these eruptions . Ferber 's Travels in Italy , p. 133 . And lastly , that a current of air attends the passage of electric matter , as is seen in presenting an electrized point to the flame of a candle . In Mr. Bruce 's account of this simoom , it was in its course over a quite dry desert of sand , ( and which was in consequence unable to conduct an electric stream into the earth beneath it ,) to some moist rocks at but a few miles distance ; and thence would appear to be a stream of electricity from a volcano attended with noxious air ; and as the bodies of Mr. Bruce and his attendants were insulated on the sand , they would not be sensible of their increased electricity , as it passed over them ; to which it may be added , that a sulphurous or suffocating sensation is said to accompany flames of lightning , and even strong sparks of artificial electricity . In the above account of the simoom , a great redness in the air is said to be a certain sign of its approach , which may be occasioned by the eruption of flame from a distant volcano in these extensive and impenetrable deserts of sand .

   <p>[ Torricell and Boyle . l. 128 . The pressure of the atmosphere was discovered by Torricelli , a disciple of Galileo , who had previously found that the air had weight . Dr. Hook and M. Du Hamel ascribe the invention of the air-pump to Mr. Boyle , who however confesses he had some hints concerning its construction from De Guerick . The vacancy at the summit of the barometer is termed the Torricellian vacuum , and the exhausted receiver of an air pump the Boylean vacuum , in honour of these two philosophers .</p>
   <p>The mist and descending dew which appear at first exhausting the receiver of an air-pump , are explained in the Phil . Trans . Vol . LXXVIII . from the cold produced by the expansion of air . For a thermometer placed in the receiver sinks some degrees , and in a very little time , as soon as a sufficient quantity of heat can be acquired from the surrounding bodies , the dew becomes again taken up . See additional notes , No . VII . Mr. Saussure observed on placing his hygrometer in a receiver of an air - pump , that though on beginning to exhaust it the air became misty , and parted with its moisture , yet the hair of his hygrometer contracted , and the instrument pointed to greater dryness . This unexpected occurrence is explained by M. Monge ( Annales de Chymie , Tom . V .) to depend on the want of the usual pressure of the atmosphere to force the aqueous particles into the pores of the hair ; and M. Saussure supposes , that his vesicular vapour requires more time to be redissolved , than is necessary to dry the hair of his thermometer . Essais sur l'Hygrom . p. 226. but I suspect there is a less hypothetical way of understanding it ; when a colder body is brought into warm and moist air , ( as a bottle of spring-water for instance ,) a steam is quickly collected on its surface ; the contrary occurs when a warmer body is brought into cold and damp air , it continues free from dew so long as it continues warm ; for it warms the atmosphere around it , and renders it capable of receiving instead of parting with moisture . The moment the air becomes rarefied in the receiver of the air-pump it becomes colder , as appears by the thermometer , and deposits its vapour ; but the hair of Mr. Saussure 's hygrometer is now warmer than the air in which it is immersed , and in consequence becomes dryer than before , by warming the air which immediately surrounds it , a part of its moisture evaporating along with its heat . ]</p>

   <note>And wide in ocean . l. 164 . Denser bodies propagate vibration or sound better than rarer ones ; if two stones be struck together under the water , they may be heard a mile or two by any one whose head is immersed at that distance , according to an experiment of Dr. Franklin . If the ear be applied to one end of a long beam of timber , the stroke of a pin at the other end becomes sensible ; if a poker be suspended in the middle of a garter , each end of which is pressed against the ear , the least percussions on the poker give great sounds . And I am informed by laying the ear on the ground the tread of a horse may be discerned at a great distance in the night . The organs of hearing belonging to fish are for this reason much less complicated than of quadrupeds , as the fluid they are immersed in so much better conveys its vibrations . And it is probable that some shell-fish which have twisted shells like the cochlea and semicircular canals of the ears of men and quadrupeds may have no appropriated organ for perceiving the vibrations of the element they live in , but may by their spiral form be in a manner all ear .</note>

   <p>[ Where oft your Priestley . l. 166 . The fame of Dr. Priestley is known in every part of the earth where science has penetrated . His various discoveries respecting the analysis of the atmosphere , and the production of variety of new airs or gasses , can only be clearly understood by reading his Experiments on Airs , ( 3 vols . octavo , Johnson , London . ) the following are amongst his many discoveries . 1 . The discovery of nitrous and dephlogisticated airs . 2 . The exhibition of the acids and alkalies in the form of air . 3 . Ascertaining the purity of respirable air by nitrous air . 4 . The restoration of vitiated air by vegetation . 5 . The influence of light to enable vegetables to yield pure air . 6 . The conversion by means of light of animal and vegetable substances , that would otherwise become putrid and offensive , into nourishment of vegetables . 7 . The use of respiration by the blood parting with phlogiston , and imbibing dephlogisticated air .</p>
   <p>The experiments here alluded to are , 1 . Concerning the production of nitrous gas from dissolving iron and many other metals in nitrous acid , which though first discovered by Dr. Hales ( Static . Ess . Vol . I. p. 224 ) was fully investigated , and applied to the important purpose of distinguishing the purity of atmospheric air by Dr. Priestley . When about two measures of common air and one of nitrous gas are mixed together a red effervescence takes place , and the two airs occupy about one fourth less space than was previously occupied by the common air alone .</p>
   <p>2 . Concerning the green substance which grows at the bottom of reservoirs of water , which Dr. Priestley discovered to yield much pure air when the sun shone on it . His method of collecting this air is by placing over the green substance , which he believes to be a vegetable of the genus conferva , an inverted bell-glass previously filled with water , which subsides as the air arises ; it has since been found that all vegetables give up pure air from their leaves , when the sun shines upon them , but not in the night , which may be owing to the sleep of the plant .</p>
   <p>3 . The third refers to the great quantity of pure air contained in the calces of metals . The calces were long known to weigh much more than the metallic bodies before calcination , insomuch that 100 pounds of lead will produce 112 pounds of minium ; the ore of manganese , which is always found near the surface of the earth , is replete with pure air , which is now used for the purpose of bleaching . Other metals when exposed to the atmosphere attract the pure air from it , and become calces by its combination , as zinc , lead , iron ; and increase in weight in proportion to the air , which they imbibe . ]</p>

   <note>When playful Proserpine . l. 178 . The fable of Proserpine 's being seized by Pluto as she was gathering flowers , is explained by Lord Bacon to signify the combination or marriage of etherial spirit with earthly materials . Bacon 's Works , Vol . V. p. 470. edit . 4to . Lond . 1778 . This allusion is still more curiously exact , from the late discovery of pure air being given up from vegetables , and that then in its unmixed state it more readily combines with metallic or inflammable bodies . From these fables which were probably taken from antient hieroglyphics there is frequently reason to believe that the Egyptians possessed much chemical knowledge , which for want of alphabetical writing perished with their philosophers .</note>

   <p>[ Led by the Sage . l. 195 . Dr. Priestley 's discovery of the production of pure air from such variety of substances will probably soon be applied to the improvement of the diving bell , as the substances which contain vital air in immense quantities are of little value as manganese and minium . See additional notes , No . XXXIII . In every hundred weight of minium there is combined about twelve pounds of pure air , now as sixty pounds of water are about a cubic foot , and as air is eight hundred times lighter than water , five hundred weight of minium will produce eight hundred cubic feet of air or about six thousand gallons . Now , as this is at least thrice as pure as atmospheric air , a gallon of it may be supposed to serve for three minutes respiration for one man . At present the air can not be set at liberty from minium by vitriolic acid without the application of some heat , this is however very likely soon to be discovered , and will then enable adventurers to journey beneath the ocean in large inverted ships or diving balloons .</p>
   <p>Mr. Boyle relates , that Cornelius Drebelle contrived not only a vessel to be rowed under water , but also a liquor to be caried in that vessel , which would supply the want of fresh air . The vessel was made by order of James I. and carried twelve rowers besides passengers . It was tried in the river Thames , and one of the persons who was in that submarine voyage told the particulars of the experiments to a person who related them to Mr. Boyle . Annual Register for 1774 , p . 248 . ]</p>
   <p>[ Day and Spalding mourn . l. 217 . Mr. Day perished in a diving bell , or diving boat , of his own construction at Plymouth in June 1774 , in which he was to have continued for a wager twelve hours one hundred feet deep in water , and probably perished from his not possessing all the hydrostatic knowledge that was necessary . See note on Ulva , Vol . II . of this work . See Annual Register for 1774. p. 245 .</p>
   <p>Mr. Spalding was professionally ingenious in the art of constructing and managing the diving bell , and had practised the business many years with success . He went down accompanied by one of his young men twice to view the wreck of the Imperial East-Indiaman at the Kish bank in Ireland . On descending the third time in June , 1783 , they remained about an hour under water , and had two barrels of air sent down to them , but on the signals from below not being again repeated , after a certain time , they were drawn up by their assistants and both found dead in the bell . Annual Register for 1783 , p. 206 . These two unhappy events may for a time check the ardor of adventurers in traversing the bottom of the ocean , but it is probable in another half century it may be safer to travel under the ocean than over it , since Dr. Priestley 's discovery of procuring pure air in such great abundance from the calces of metals . ]</p>
   <note>Hapless Pierce ! l , 219 . The Haslewell East-Indiaman , outward bound , was wrecked off Seacomb in the isle of Purbec on the 6th of January , 1786 ; when Capt . Pierce , the commander , with two young ladies , his daughters , and the greatest part of the crew and passengers perished in the sea . Some of the officers and about seventy seamen escaped with great difficulty on the rocks , but Capt . Pierce finding it was impossible to save the lives of the young ladies refused to quit the ship , and perished with them .</note>

   <p>[ Volcanic gales . l. 294 . The pestilential winds of the east are described by various authors under various denominations ; as harmattan , samiel , samium , syrocca , kamsin , seravansum . M. de Beauchamp describes a remarkable south wind in the deserts about Bagdad , called seravansum , or poison-wind ; it burns the face , impedes respiration , strips the trees of their leaves , and is said to pass on in a streight line , and often kills people in six hours . P. Cotte sur la Meteorol . Analytical Review for February , 1790 . M. Volney says , the hot wind or ramsin seems to blow at the season when the sands of the deserts are the hottest ; the air is then filled with an extreamly subtle dust . Vol . I. p. 61 . These winds blow in all directions from the deserts ; in Egypt the most violent proceed from the S. S. W . at Mecca from the E. at Surat from the N. at Bassora from the N. W . at Bagdad from the W. and in Syria from the S. E .</p>
   <p>On the south of Syria , he adds , where the Jordan flows is a country of volcanos ; and it is observed that the earthquakes in Syria happen after their rainy season , which is also conformable to a similar observation made by Dr. Shaw in Barbary . Travels in Egypt , Vol . I. p. 303 .</p>
   <p>These winds seem all to be of volcanic origin , as before mentioned , with this difference , that the Simoom is attended with a stream of electric matter ; they seem to be in consequence of earthquakes caused by the monsoon floods , which fall on volcanic fires in Syria , at the same time that they inundate the Nile . ]</p>

   <note>One golden secret . l. 308 . The suddenness of the change of the wind from N. E . to S. W . seems to shew that it depends on some minute chemical cause ; which if it was discovered might probably , like other chemical causes , be governed by human agency ; such as blowing up rocks by gunpowder , or extracting the lightening from the clouds . If this could be accomplished , it would be the most happy discovery that ever has happened to these northern latitudes , since in this country the N. E . winds bring frost , and the S. W . ones are attended with warmth and moisture ; if the inferior currents of air could be kept perpetually from the S. W . supplied by new productions of air at the line , or by superior currents flowing in a contrary direction , the vegetation of this country would be doubled ; as in the moist vallies of Africa , which know no frost ; the number of its inhabitants would be increased , and their lives prolonged ; as great abundance of the aged and infirm of mankind , as well as many birds and animals , are destroyed by severe continued frosts in this climate .</note>

Mr. Ray asserts that 101 seeds of tobacco weighed only one grain , and that from one tobacco plant the seeds thus calculated amounted to 360 , 000 ! The seeds of the ferns are by him supposed to exceed a million on a leaf . As the works of nature are governed by general laws this exuberant reproduction prevents the accidental extinction of the species , at the same time that they serve for food for the higher orders of animation .</p>
   <p>Every seed possesses a reservoir of nutriment designed for the growth of the future plant , this consists of starch , mucilage , or oil , within the coat of the seed , or of sugar and subacid pulp in the fruits , which belongs to it .</p>
   <p>For the preservation of the immature seed nature has used many ingenious methods ; some are wrapped in down , as the seeds of the rose , bean , and cotton-plant ; others are suspended in a large air-vessel , as those of the bladder-sena , staphylaea , and pea . ]</p>

   <p>[ Teach the fine seed . l. 411 . The seeds in their natural state fall on the surface of the earth , and having absorbed some moisture the root shoots itself downwards into the earth and the plume rises in air .

   <p>The pith seems to push up or elongate the bud by its elasticity , like the pith in the callow quills of birds . This medulla Linneus believes to consist of a bundle of fibres , which diverging breaks through the bark yet gelatinous producing the buds .</p>
   <p>The lobes are reservoirs of prepared nutriment for the young seed , which is absorbed by its placental vessels , and converted into sugar , till it has penetrated with its roots far enough into the earth to extract sufficient moisture , and has acquired leaves to convert it into nourishment . In some plants these lobes rise from the earth and supply the place of leaves , as in kidney-beans , cucumbers , and hence seem to serve both as a placenta to the foetus , and lungs to the young plant . During the process of germination the starch of the seed is converted into sugar , as is seen in the process of malting barley for the purpose of brewing . And is on this account very similar to the digestion of food in the stomachs of animals , which converts all their aliment into a chyle , which consists of mucilage , oil , and sugar ; the placentation of buds will be spoken of hereafter . ]</p>

The males , or stamens , have their anthers replete with a prolific powder containing the vivifying fovilla : in the females , or pistils , exists the ovary , terminated by the tubular stigma . When the anthers burst and shed their bags of dust , the male fovilla is received by the prolific lymph of the stigma , and produces the seed or egg , which is nourished in the ovary .

   <p>[ Wound them , ye Sylphs ! l. 463 . Mr. Whitmill advised to bind some of the most vigorous shoots with strong wire , and even some of the large roots ; and Mr. Warner cuts , what he calls a wild worm about the body of the tree , or scores the bark quite to the wood like a screw with a sharp knife . Bradley on Gardening , Vol . II . p. 155 . Mr. Fitzgerald produced flowers and fruit on wall trees by cutting off a part of the bark . Phil . Trans . Ann . 1761 . M. Buffon produced the same effect by a straight bandage put round a branch , Act . Paris , Ann . 1738 , and concludes that an ingrafted branch bears better from its vessels being compressed by the callous .</p>
   <p>A compleat cylinder of the bark about an inch in height was cut off from the branch of a pear tree against a wall in Mr. Howard 's garden at Lichfield about five years ago , the circumcised part is now not above half the diameter of the branch above and below it , yet this branch has been full of fruit every year since , when the other branches of the tree bore only sparingly . I lately observed that the leaves of this wounded branch were smaller and paler , and the fruit less in size , and ripened sooner than on the other parts of the tree . Another branch has the bark taken off not quite all round with much the same effect .</p>
   <p>The theory of this curious vegetable fact has been esteemed difficult , but receives great light from the foregoing account of the individuality of buds . A flower-bud dies , when it has perfected its seed , like an annual plant , and hence requires no place on the bark for new roots to pass downwards ; but on the contrary leaf-buds , as they advance into shoots , form new buds in the axilla of every leaf , which new buds require new roots to pass down the bark , and thus thicken as well as elongate the branch , now if a wire or string be tied round the bark , many of these new roots cannot descend , and thence more of the buds will be converted into flower-buds .</p>
   <p>It is customary to debark oak-trees in the spring , which are intended to be felled in the ensuing autumn ; because the bark comes off easier at this season , and the sap-wood , or alburnum , is believed to become harder and more durable , if the tree remains till the end of summer . The trees thus stripped of their bark put forth shoots as usual with acorns on the 6th 7th and 8th joint , like vines ; but in the branches I examined , the joints of the debarked trees were much shorter than those of other oak - trees ; the acorns were more numerous ; and no new buds were produced above the joints which bore acorns . From hence it appears that the branches of debarked oak-trees produce fewer leaf-buds , and more flower - buds , which last circumstance I suppose must depend on their being sooner or later debarked in the vernal months . And , secondly , that the new buds of debarked oak-trees continue to obtain moisture from the alburnum after the season of the ascent of sap in other vegetables ceases ; which in this unnatural state of the debarked tree may act as capillary tubes , like the alburnum of the small debarked cylinder of a pear-tree abovementioned ; or may continue to act as placental vessels , as happens to the animal embryon in cases of superfetation ; when the fetus continues a month or two in the womb beyond its usual time , of which some instances have been recorded , the placenta continues to supply perhaps the double office both of nutrition and of respiration . ]</p>
   <note>And bend to earth . l. 466 . Mr. Hitt in his treatise on fruit trees observes that if a vigorous branch of a wall tree be bent to the horizon , or beneath it , it looses its vigour and becomes a bearing branch . The theory of this I suppose to depend on the difficulty with which the leaf-shoots can protrude the roots necessary for their new progeny of buds upwards along the bended branch to the earth contrary to their natural habits or powers , whence more flower-shoots are produced which do not require new roots to pass along the bark of the bended branch , but which let their offspring , the seeds , fall upon the earth and seek roots for themselves .</note>
   <note>With new prolific power . l. 467 . About Midsummer the new buds are formed , but it is believed by some of the Linnean school , that these buds may in their early state be either converted into flower-buds or leaf-buds according to the vigour of the vegetating branch . Thus if the upper part of a branch be cut away , the buds near the extremity of the remaining stem , having a greater proportional supply of nutriment , or possessing a greater facility of shooting their roots , or absorbent vessels , down the bark , will become leaf-buds , which might otherwise have been flower-buds . And the contrary as explained in note on l. 463. of this Canto .</note>
   <note>Closed in the style . l. 469 . “ I conceive the medulla of a plant to consist of a bundle of nervous fibres , and that the propelling vital power separates their uppermost extremities . These , diverging , penetrate the bark , which is now gelatinous , and become multiplied in the new gem , or leaf-bud . The ascending vessels of the bark being thus divided by the nervous fibres , which perforate it , and the ascent of its fluids being thus impeded , the bark is extended into a leaf . But the flower is produced , when the protrusion of the medulla is greater than the retention of the including cortical part ; whence the substance of the bark is expanded in the calyx ; that of the rind , ( or interior bark ,) in the corol ; that of the wood in the stamens , that of the medulla in the pistil . Vegetation thus terminates in the production of new life , the ultimate medullary and cortical fibres being collected in the seeds . ” Linnei Systema Veget . p. 6. edit . 14 .</note>

The buds did not take , nevertheless in a fortnight yellow spots began to shew themselves about three feet above the inoculation , and in a short time afterwards yellow spots appeared on a shoot which came out of the ground from another part of the plant . Bradley , Vol . II . p. 129 . These facts are the more curious since from experiments of ingrafting red currants on black ( Ib . Vol . II . ) the fruit does not acquire any change of flavour , and by many other experiments neither colour nor any other change is produced in the fruit ingrafted on other stocks .</p>
   <p>There is an apple described in Bradley 's work which is said to have one side of it a sweet fruit which boils soft , and the other side a sour fruit which boils hard , which Mr. Bradley so long ago as the year 1721 ingeniously ascribes to the farina of one of these apples impregnating the other , which would seem the more probable if we consider that each division of an apple is a separate womb , and may therefore have a separate impregnation like puppies of different kinds in one litter . The same is said to have occurred in oranges and lemons , and grapes of different colours . ]</p>

   <p>[ Fair Cyprepedia . l. 505 . The cyprepedium from South America is supposed to be of larger size and brighter colours than that from North America from which this print is taken ; it has a large globular nectary about the size of a pidgeon 's egg of a fleshy colour , and an incision or depression on its upper part , much resembling the body of the large American spider ; this globular nectary is attached to divergent slender petals not unlike the legs of the same animal . This spider is called by Linneus Arenea avicularia , with a convex orbicular thorax , the center transversely excavated , he adds that it catches small birds as well as insects , and has the venemous bite of a serpent . System Nature , Tom . I. p. 1034 . M. Lonvilliers de Poincy , ( Histoire Nat . des Antilles , Cap . xiv . art . III . ) calls it Phalange , and describes the body to be the size of a pidgeon 's egg , with a hollow on its back like a navel , and mentions its catching the humming-bird in its strong nets .</p>
   <p>The similitude of this flower to this great spider seems to be a vegetable contrivance to prevent the humming-bird from plundering its honey . About Matlock in Derbyshire the fly-ophris is produced , the nectary of which so much resembles the small wall-bee , perhaps the apis ichneumonea , that it may be easily mistaken for it at a small distance . It is probable that by this means it may often escape being plundered . See note on lonicera in the next poem .</p>

   <p>Clavus , when the seeds grow out into larger horns black without , as in rye . This is called Ergot by the french writers .</p>
   <p>Ustulago , when the fruit instead of seed produces a black powder , as in barley , oats , &amp; c. To which perhaps the honey-dew ought to have been added , and the canker , in the former of which the nourishing fluid of the plant seems to be exsuded by a retrograde motion of the cutaneous lymphatics , as in the sweating sickness of the last century . The latter is a phagedenic ulcer of the bark , very destructive to young apple - trees , and which in cherry-trees is attended with a deposition of gum arabic , which often terminates in the death of the tree . ]</p>
   <note>Ergot 's horn . l. 513 . There is a disease frequently affects the rye in France , and sometimes in England in moist seasons , which is called Ergot , or horn seed ; the grain becomes considerably elongated and is either straight or crooked , containing black meal along with the white , and appears to be pierced by insects , which were probably the cause of the disease . Mr. Duhamel ascribes it to this cause , and compares it to galls on oak-leaves . By the use of this bad grain amongst the poor diseases have been produced attended with great debility and mortification of the extremities both in France and England . Dict . Raison . art . Siegle .

   <p>[ On glass unneal 'd . l. 519 . The glass makers occasionally make what they call proofs , which are cooled hastily , whereas the other glass vessels are removed from warmer ovens to cooler ones , and suffered to cool by slow degrees , which is called annealing , or nealing them . If an unnealed glass be scratched by even a grain of sand falling into it , it will seem to consider of it for some time , or even a day , and will then crack into a thousand pieces .</p>
   <p>The same happens to a smooth surfaced lead-ore in Derbyshire , the workmen having cleared a large face of it scratch it with picks , and in a few hours many tons of it crack to pieces and fall , with a kind of explosion . Whitehurst 's Theory of Earth .</p>
   <p>Glass dropped into cold water , called Prince Rupert 's drops , explode when a small part of their tails are broken off , more suddenly indeed , but probably from the same cause . Are the internal particles of these elastic bodies kept so far from each other by the external crust that they are nearly in a state of repulsion into which state they are thrown by their vibrations from any violence applied ? Or , like elastic balls in certain proportions suspended in contact with each other , can motion once began be increased by their elasticity , till the whole explodes ? And can this power be applied to any mechanical purposes ? ]</p>

   <p>[ With ambrosial slumbers . l. 538 . Many vegetables during the night do not seem to respire , but to sleep like the dormant animals and insects in winter . This appears from the mimosa and many other plants closing the upper sides of their leaves together in their sleep , and thus precluding that side of them from both light and air . And from many flowers closing up the polished or interior side of their petals , which we have also endeavoured to shew to be a respiratory organ .</p>
   <p>The irritability of plants is abundantly evinced by the absorption and pulmonary circulation of their juices ; their sensibility is shewn by the approaches of the males to the females , and of the females to the males in numerous instances ; and , as the essential circumstance of sleep consists in the temporary abolition of voluntary power alone , the sleep of plants evinces that they possess voluntary power ; which also indisputably appears in many of them by closing their petals or their leaves during cold , or rain , or darkness , or from mechanic violence . ]</p>

   <p>[ Diana 's trees , l. 552 . The chemists and astronomers from the earliest antiquity have used the same characters to represent the metals and the planets , which were most probably outlines or abstracts of the original hieroglyphic figures of Egypt . These afterwards acquired niches in their temples , and represented Gods as well as metals and planets ; whence silver is called Diana , or the moon , in the books of alchemy .</p>
   <p>The process for making Diana 's silver tree is thus described by Lemeri . Dissolve one ounce of pure silver in acid of nitre very pure and moderately strong ; mix this solution with about twenty ounces of distilled water ; add to this two ounces of mercury , and let it remain at rest . In about four days there will form upon the mercury a tree of silver with branches imitating vegetation .</p>
   <p>1 . As the mercury has a greater affinity than silver with the nitrous acid , the silver becomes precipitated ; and , being deprived of the nitrous oxygene by the mercury , sinks down in its metallic form and lustre . 2 . The attraction between silver and mercury , which causes them readily to amalgamate together , occasions the precipitated silver to adhere to the surface of the mercury in preference to any other part of the vessel . 3 . The attraction of the particles of the precipitated silver to each other causes the beginning branches to thicken and elongate into trees and shrubs rooted on the mercury . For other circumstances concerning this beautiful experiment see Mr. Keir 's Chemical Dictionary , art . Arbor Dianae ; a work perhaps of greater utility to mankind than the lost Alexandrian Library ; the continuation of which is so eagerly expected by all , who are occupied in the arts , or attached to the sciences . ]</p>

   <p>There seem to be three concentric strata of our incumbent atmosphere ; in which , or between them , are produced four kinds of meteors ; lightning , shooting stars , fire-balls , and northern lights . First , the lower region of air , or that which is dense enough to resist by the adhesion of its particles the descent of condensed vapour , or clouds , which may extend from one to three or four miles high . In this region the common lightning is produced from the accumulation or defect of electric matter in those floating fields of vapour either in respect to each other , or in respect to the earth beneath them , or the dissolved vapour above them , which is constantly varying both with the change of the form of the clouds , which thus evolve a greater or less surface ; and also with their ever-changing degree of condensation . As the lightning is thus produced in dense air , it proceeds but a short course on account of the greater resistance which it encounters , is attended with a loud explosion , and appears with a red light .</p>
   <p>2 . The second region of the atmosphere I suppose to be that which has too little tenacity to support condensed vapour or clouds ; but which yet contains invisible vapour , or water in aerial solution . This aerial solution of water differs from that dissolved in the matter of heat , as it is supported by its adhesion to the particles of air , and is not precipitated by cold . In this stratum it seems probable that the meteors called shooting stars are produced ; and that they consist of electric sparks , or lightning , passing from one region to another of these invisible fields of aero-aqueous solution . The height of these shooting stars has not yet been ascertained by sufficient observation ; Dr. Blagden thinks their situation is lower down in the atmosphere than that of fireballs , which he conjectures from their swift apparent motion , and ascribes their smallness to the more minute division of the electric matter of which they are supposed to consist , owing to the greater resistance of the denser medium through which they pass , than that in which the fire-balls exist . Mr. Brydone observed that the shooting stars appeared to him to be as high in the atmosphere , when he was near the summit of mount Etna , as they do when observed from the plain . Phil . Tran . Vol . LXIII .</p>
   <p>As the stratum of air , in which shooting stars are supposed to exist is much rarer than that in which lightning resides , and yet much denser than that in which fire-balls are produced , they will be attracted at a greater distance than the former , and at a less than the latter . From this rarity of the air so small a sound will be produced by their explosion , as not to reach the lower parts of the atmosphere ; their quantity of light from their greater distance being small , is never seen through dense air at all , and thence does not appear red , like lightning or fire balls . There are no apparent clouds to emit or to attract them , because the constituent parts of these aero-aqueous regions may possess an abundance or deficiency of electric matter and yet be in perfect reciprocal solution . And lastly their apparent train of light is probably owing only to a continuance of their impression on the eye ; as when a fire-stick is whirled in the dark it gives the appearance of a compleat circle of fire : for these white trains of shooting stars quickly vanish , and do not seem to set any thing on fire in their passage , as seems to happen in the transit of fire-balls .</p>
   <p>3 . The second region or stratum of air terminates I suppose where the twilight ceases to be refracted , that is , where the air is 3000 times rarer than at the surface of the earth ; and where it seems probable that the common air ends , and is surrounded by an atmosphere of inflammable gas tenfold rarer than itself . In this region I believe fire-balls sometimes to pass , and at other times the northern lights to exist . One of these fire-balls or draco volans , was observed by Dr. Pringle and many others on Nov. 26 , 1758 , which was afterwards estimated to have been a mile and a half in circumference , to have been about one hundred miles high , and to have moved towards the north with a velocity of near thirty miles in a second of time . This meteor had a real tail many miles long , which threw off sparks in its course , and the whole exploded with a sound like distant thunder . Philos . Trans . Vol . LI .</p>
   <p>Dr. Blagden has related the history of another large meteor , or fire - ball , which was seen the 18th of August , 1783 , with many ingenious observations and conjectures . This was estimated to be between 60 and 70 miles high , and to travel 1000 miles at the rate of about twenty miles in a second . This fire-ball had likewise a real train of light left behind it in its passage , which varied in colour ; and in some part of its course gave off sparks or explosions where it had been brightest ; and a dusky red streak remained visible perhaps a minute . Philos . Trans . Vol . LXXIV .</p>
   <p>These fire-balls differ from lightning , and from shooting stars in many remarkable circumstances ; as their very great bulk , being a mile and a half in diameter ; their travelling 1000 miles nearly horizontally ; their throwing off sparks in their passage ; and changing colours from bright blue to dusky red ; and leaving a train of fire behind them , continuing about a minute . They differ from the northern lights in not being diffused , but passing from one point of the heavens to another in a defined line ; and this in a region above the crepuscular atmosphere , where the air is 3000 tines rarer than at the surface of the earth . There has not yet been even a conjecture which can account for these appearances !— One I shall therefore hazard ; which , if it does not inform , may amuse the reader .</p>
   <p>In the note on l. 123 , it was shewn that there is probably a supernatant stratum of inflammable gas or hydrogene , over the common atmosphere ; and whose density at the surface where they meet , must be at least ten times less than that upon which it swims ; like chemical ether floating upon water , and perhaps without any real contact . 1 . In this region , where the aerial atmosphere terminates and the inflammable one begins , the quantity of tenacity or resistance must be almost inconceivable ; in which a ball of electricity might pass 1000 miles with greater ease than through a thousandth part of an inch of glass . 2 . Such a ball of electricity passing between inflammable and common air would set fire to them in a line as it patted along ; which would differ in colour according to the greater proportionate commixture of the two airs ; and from the same cause there might occur greater degrees of inflammation , or branches of fire , in some parts of its course .</p>
   <p>As these fire-balls travel in a defined line , it is pretty evident from the known laws of electricity , that they must be attracted ; and as they are a mile or more in diameter , they must be emitted from a large surface of electric matter ; because large nobs give larger sparks , less diffused , and more brightly luminous , than less ones or points , and resist more forceably the emission of the electric matter . What is there in nature can attract them at so great a distance as 1000 miles , and so forceably as to detach an electric spark of a mile diameter ? Can volcanos at the time of their eruptions have this effect , as they are generally attended with lightning ? Future observations must discover these secret operations of nature ! As a stream of common air is carried along with the passage of electric aura from one body to another ; it is easy to conceive , that the common air and the inflammable air between which the fire-ball is supposed to pass , will be partially intermixed by being thus agitated , and so far as it becomes intermixed it will take fire , and produce the linear flame and branching sparks above described . In this circumstance of their being attracted , and thence passing in a defined line , the fire-balls seem to differ from the coruscations of the aurora borealis , or northern lights , which probably take place in the same region of the atmosphere ; where the common air exists in extreme tenuity , and is covered by a still rarer sphere of inflammable gas , ten times lighter than itself .</p>
   <p>As the electric streams , which constitute these northern lights , seem to be repelled or radiated from an accumulation of that fluid in the north , and not attracted like the fireballs ; this accounts for the diffusion of their light , as well as the silence of their passage ; while their variety of colours , and the permanency of them , and even the breadth of them in different places , may depend on their setting on fire the mixture of inflammable and common air through which they pass ; as seems to happen in the transit of the fire-balls .</p>
   <p>It was observed by Dr. Priestley that the electric shock taken through inflammable air was red , in common air it is blueish ; to these circumstances perhaps some of the colours of the northern lights may bear analogy ; though the density of the medium through which light is seen must principally vary its colour , as is well explained by Mr. Morgan . Phil . Trans . Vol . LXXV . Hence lightning is red when seen through a dark cloud , or near the horizon ; because the more refrangible rays cannot permeate so dense a medium . But the shooting stars consist of white light , as they are generally seen on clear nights , and nearly vertical : in other situations their light is probably too faint to come to us . But as in some remarkable appearances of the northern lights , as in March , 1716 , all the prismatic colours were seen quickly to succeed each other , these appear to have been owing to real combustion ; as the density of the interposed medium could not be supposed to change so frequently ; and therefore these colours must have been owing to different degrees of heat according to Mr. Morgan 's theory of combustion . In Smith 's Optics , p. 69. the prismatic colours , and optical deceptions of the northern lights are described by Mr. Cotes .</p>
   <p>The Torricellian vacuum , if perfectly free from air , is said by Mr. Morgan and others to be a perfect non-conductor . This circumstance therefore would preclude the electric streams from rising above the atmosphere . But as Mr. Morgan did not try to pass an electric shock through a vacuum , and as air , or something containing air , surrounding the transit of electricity may be necessary to the production of light , the conclusion may perhaps still be dubious . If however the streams of the northern lights were supposed to rise above our atmosphere , they would only be visible at each extremity of their course ; where they emerge from , or are again immerged into the atmosphere ; but not in their journey through the vacuum ; for the absence of electric light in a vacuum is sufficiently proved by the common experiment of shaking a barometer in the dark ; the electricity , produced by the friction of the mercury in the glass at its top , is luminous if the barometer has a little air in it ; but there is no light if the vacuum be complete .</p>
   <p>The aurora borealis , or northern dawn , is very ingeniously accounted for by Dr. Franklin on principles of electricity . He premises the following electric phenomena : 1. that all new fallen snow has much positive electricity standing on its surface . 2 . That about twelve degrees of latitude round the poles are covered with a crust of eternal ice , which is impervious to the electric fluid . 3 . That the dense part of the atmosphere rises but a few miles high ; and that in the rarer parts of it the electric fluid will pass to almost any distance .</p>
   <p>Hence he supposes there must be a great accumulation of positive electric matter on the fresh fallen snow in the polar regions ; which , not being able to pass through the crust of ice into the earth , must rise into the rare air of the upper parts of our atmosphere , which will the least resist its passage ; and passing towards the equator descend again into the denser atmosphere , and thence into the earth in silent streams . And that many of the appearances attending these lights are optical deceptions , owing to the situation of the eye that beholds them ; which makes all ascending parallel lines appear to converge to a point .</p>
   <p>The idea , above explained in note on l. 123 , of the existence of a sphere of inflammable gas over the aerial atmosphere would much favour this theory of Dr. Franklin ; because in that case the dense aerial atmosphere would rise a much less height in the polar regions , diminishing almost to nothing at the pole itself ; and thus give an easier passage to the ascent of the electric fluid . And from the great difference in the specific gravity of the two airs , and the velocity of the earth 's rotation , there must be a place between the poles and the equator , where the superior atmosphere of inflammable gas would terminate ; which would account for these streams of the aurora borealis not appearing near the equator ; add to this that it is probable the electric fluid may be heavier than the magnetic one ; and will thence by the rotation of the earth 's surface ascend over the magnetic one by its centrifugal force ; and may thus be induced to rise through the thin stratum of aerial atmosphere over the poles . See note on Canto II . l. 193 . I shall have occasion again to mention this great accumulation of inflammable air over the poles ; and to conjecture that these northern lights may be produced by the union of inflammable with common air , without the assistance of the electric spark to throw them into combustion .</p>
   <p>The antiquity of the appearance of northern lights has been doubted ; as none were recorded in our annals since the remarkable one on Nov. 14 , 1574 , till another remarkable one on March 6 , 1716 , and the three following nights , which were seen at the same time in Ireland , Russia , and Poland , extending near 30 degrees of longitude and from about the 50th degree of latitude over almost all the north of Europe . There is however reason to believe them of remote antiquity though inaccurately described ; thus the following curious passage from the Book of Maccabees , ( B. II . c. v .) is such a description of them , as might probably be given by an ignorant and alarmed people . “ Through all the city , for the space of almost forty days , there were seen horsemen running in the air , in cloth of gold , and armed with lances , like a band of soldiers ; and troops of horsemen in array encountering and running one against another , with shaking of shields and multitude of pikes , and drawing of swords , and casting of darts , and glittering of golden ornaments and harness . ”</p>

   <p>The manner in which the rainbow is produced was in some measure understood before Sir Isaac Newton had discovered his theory of colours . The first person who expressly shewed the rainbow to be formed by the reflection of the sunbeams from drops of falling rain was Antonio de Dominis . This was afterwards more fully and distinctly explained by Des Cartes . But what caused the diversity of its colours was not then understood ; it was reserved for the immortal Newton to discover that the rays of light consisted of seven combined colours of different refrangibility , which could be seperated at pleasure by a wedge of glass . Pemberton 's View of Newton .</p>
   <p>Sir Isaac Newton discovered that the prismatic spectrum was composed of seven colours in the following proportions , violet 80 , indigo 40 , blue 60 , green 60 , yellow 48 , orange 27 , red 45 . If all these colours be painted on a circular card in the proportions above mentioned , and the card be rapidly whirled on its center , they produce in the eye the sensation of white . And any one of these colours may be imitated by painting a card with the two colours which are contiguous to it , in the same proportions as in the spectrum , and whirling them in the same manner . My ingenious friend , Mr. Galton of Birmingham , ascertained in this manner by a set of experiments the following propositions ; the truth of which he had preconceived from the above data .</p>
   <p>1 . Any colour in the prismatic spectrum may be imitated by a mixture of the two colours contiguous to it .</p>
   <p>2 . If any three successive colours in the prismatic spectrum are mixed , they compose only the second or middlemost colour .</p>
   <p>3 . If any four succesive colours in the prismatic spectrum be mixed , a tint similar to a mixture of the second and third colours will be produced , but not precisely the same , because they are not in the same proportion .</p>
   <p>4 . If beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum , you take of the second colour a quantity equal to the first , second , and third ; and add to that the fifth colour , equal in quantity to the fourth , fifth , and sixth ; and with these combine the seventh colour in the proportion it exists in the spectrum , white will be produced . Because the first , second , and third , compose only the second ; and the fourth , fifth , and sixth , compose only the fifth ; therefore if the seventh be added , the same effect is produced , as if all the seven were employed .</p>
   <p>5 . Beginning with any colour in the circular spectrum , if you take a tint composed of a certain proportion of the second and third , ( equal in quantity to the first , second , third , and fourth ,) and add to this the sixth colour equal in quantity to the fifth , sixth , and seventh , white will be produced .</p>
   <p>From these curious experiments of Mr. Galton many phenomena in the chemical changes of colours may probably become better understood ; especially if , as I suppose , the same theory must apply to transmitted colours , as to reflected ones . Thus it is well known , that if the glass of mangonese , which is a tint probably composed of violet and indigo , be mixed in a certain proportion with the glass of lead , which is yellow ; that the mixture becomes transparent . Now from Mr. Galton 's experiments it appears , that in reflected colours such a mixture would produce white , that is , the same as if all the colours were reflected . And therefore in transmitted colours the same circumstances must produce transparency , that is , the same as if all the colours were transmitted . For the particles , which constitute the glass of mangonese will transmit red , violet , indigo , and blue ; and those of the glass of lead will transmit orange , yellow , and green ; hence all the primary colours by a mixture of these glasses become transmitted , that is , the glass becomes transparent .</p>
   <p>Mr. Galton has further observed that five successive prismatic colours may be combined in such proportions as to produce but one colour , a circumstance which might be of consequence in the art of painting . For if you begin at any part of the circular spectrum above described , and take the first , second , and third colours in the proportions in which they exist in the spectrum ; these will compose only the second colour equal in quantity to the first , second , and third ; add to these the third , fourth , and fifth in the proportion they exist in the spectrum , and these will produce the fourth colour equal in quantity to the third , fourth , and fifth . Consequently this is precisely the same thing , as mixing the second and fourth colours only ; which mixture would only produce the third colour . Therefore if you combine the first , second , fourth , and fifth in the proportions in which they exist in the spectrum , with double the quantity of the third colour , this third colour will be produced . It is probable that many of the unexpected changes in mixing colours on a painter 's easle , as well as in more fluid chemical mixtures , may depend on these principles rather than on a new arrangement or combination of their minute particles .</p>
   <p>Mr. Galton further observes , that white may universally be produced by the combination of one prismatic colour , and a tint intermediate to two others . Which tint may be distinguished by a name compounded of the two colours , to which it is intermediate . Thus white is produced by a mixture of red with blue-green . Of orange with indigo-blue . Of Yellow with violet-indigo . Of green with red-violet . Of blue with Orange-red . Of indigo with yellow-orange . Of violet with green-yellow . Which he further remarks exactly coincides with the theory and facts mentioned by Dr. Robert Darwin of Shrewsbury in his account of ocular spectra ; who has shewn that when one of these contrasted colours has been long viewed , a spectrum or appearance of the other becomes visible in the fatigued eye . Philos . Trans . Vol . LXXVI . for the year 1786 .</p>
   <p>These experiments of Mr. Galton might much assist the copper-plate printers of callicoes and papers in colours ; as three colours or more might be produced by two copper-plates . Thus suppose some yellow figures were put on by the first plate , and upon some parts of these yellow figures and on other parts of the ground blue was laid on by another copper-plate . The three colours of yellow , blue , and green might be produced ; as green leaves with yellow and blue flowers .</p>

   <p>The rays from the rising and setting sun are refracted by our spherical atmosphere , hence the most refrangible rays , as the violet , indigo , and blue are reflected in greater quantities from the morning and evening skies ; and the least refrangible ones , as red and orange , are last seen about the setting sun . Hence Mr. Beguelin observed that the shadow of his finger on his pocket-book was much bluer in the morning and evening , when the shadow was about eight times as long as the body from which it was projected . Mr. Melville observes , that the blue rays being more refrangible are bent down in the evenings by our atmosphere , while the red and orange being less refrangible continue to pass on and tinge the morning and evening clouds with their colours . See Priestley 's History of Light and Colours , p. 440 . But as the particles of air , like those of water , are themselves blue , a blue shadow may be seen at all times of the day , though much more beautifully in the mornings and evenings , or by means of a candle in the middle of the day . For if a shadow on a piece of white paper is produced by placing your finger between the paper and a candle in the day light , the shadow will appear very blue ; the yellow light of the candle upon the other parts of the paper apparently deepens the blue by its contrast ; these colours being opposite to each other , as explained in note II .</p>
   <p>Colours are produced from clouds or mists by refraction , as well as by reflection . In riding in the night over an unequal country I observed a very beautiful coloured halo round the moon , whenever I was covered with a few feet of mist , as I ascended from the vallies ; which ceased to appear when I rose above the mist . This I suppose was owing to the thinness of the stratum of mist , in which I was immersed ; had it been thicker , the colours refracted by the small drops , of which a fog consists , would not have passed through it down to my eye .</p>
   <p>There is a bright spot seen on the cornea of the eye , when we face a window , which is much attended to by portrait painters ; this is the light reflected from the spherical surface of the polished cornea , and brought to a focus ; if the observer is placed in this focus , he sees the image of the window ; if he is placed before or behind the focus , he only sees a luminous spot , which is more luminous and of less extent , the nearer he approaches to the focus . The luminous appearance of the eyes of animals in the dusky corners of a room , or in holes in the earth , may arise in some instances from the same principle ; viz . the reflection of the light from the spherical cornea ; which will be coloured red or blue in some degree by the morning , evening , or meridian light ; or by the objects from which that light is previously reflected . In the cavern at Colebrook Dale , where the mineral tar exsudes , the eyes of the horse , which was drawing a cart from within towards the mouth of it , appeared like two balls of phosphorus , when he was above 100 yards off , and for a long time before any other part of the animal was visible . In this case I suspect the luminous appearance to have been owing to the light , which had entered the eye , being reflected from the back surface of the vitreous humour , and thence emerging again in parallel rays from the animals eye , as it does from the back surface of the drops of the rainbow , and from the water-drops which lie , perhaps without contact , on cabbage-leaves , and have the brilliancy of quicksilver . This accounts for this luminous appearance being best seen in those animals which have large apertures in their iris , as in cats and horses , and is the only part visible in obscure places , because this is a better reflecting surface than any other part of the animal . If any of these emergent rays from the animals eye can be supposed to have been reflected from the choroid coat through the semi-transparent retina , this would account for the coloured glare of the eyes of dogs or cats and rabits in dark corners .</p>

   <p>There have been many theories invented to account for the tails of comets . Sir Isaac Newton thinks that they consist of rare vapours raised from the nucleus of the comet , and so rarefied by the sun 's heat as to have their general gravitation diminished , and that they in consequence ascend opposite to the sun , and from thence reflect the rays of light . Dr. Halley compares the light of the tails of comets to the streams of the aurora borealis , and other electric effluvia . Philos . Trans . No . 347 .</p>
   <p>Dr. Hamilton observes that the light of small stars are seen undiminished through both the light of the tails of comets , and of the aurora borealis , and has further illustrated their electric analogy , and adds that the tails of comets consist of a lucid self-shining substance which has not the power of refracting or reflecting the rays of light . Essays .</p>
   <p>The tail of the comet of 1744 at one time appeared to extend above 16 degrees from its body , and must have thence been above twenty three millions of miles long . And the comet of 1680 , according to the calculations of Dr. Halley on November the 11th , was not above one semi - diameter of the earth , or less than 4000 miles to the northward of the way of the earth ; at which time had the earth been in that part of its orbit , what might have been the consequence ! no one would probably have survived to have registered the tremendous effects .</p>
   <p>The comet of 1531 , 1607 , and 1682 having returned in the year 1759 , according to Dr. Halley 's prediction in the Philos . Trans . for 1705 , there seems no reason to doubt that all the other comets will return after their proper periods . Astronomers have in general acquiesced in the conjecture of Dr. Halley , that the comets of 1532 , and 1661 are one and the same comet , from the similarity of the elements of their orbits , and were therefore induced to expect its return to its perihelium 1789 . As this comet is liable to be disturbed in its ascent from the sun by the planets Jupiter and Saturn , Dr. Maskelyne expected its return to its perihelium in the beginning of the year 1789 , or the latter end of the year 1788 , and certainly sometime before the 27th of April , 1789 , which prediction has not been fulfilled .

   <p>The dispute among philosophers about phlogiston is not concerning the existence of an inflammable principle , but rather whether there be one or more inflammable principles . The disciples of Stahl , which till lately included the whole chemical world , believed in the identity of phlogiston in all bodies which would flame or calcine . The disciples of Lavoisier pay homage to a plurality of phlogistons under the various names of charcoal , sulphur , metals , &amp; c. Whatever will unite with pure air , and thence compose an acid , is esteemed in this ingenious theory to be a different kind of phlogistic or inflammable body . At the same time there remains a doubt whether these inflammable bodies , as metals , sulphur , charcoal , &amp; c. may not be compounded of the same phlogiston along with some other material yet undiscovered , and thus an unity of phlogiston exist , as in the theory of Stahl , though very differently applied in the explication of chemical phenomena .</p>
   <p>Some modern philosophers are of opinion that the sun is the great fountain from which the earth and other planets derive all the phlogiston which they possess ; and that this is formed by the combination of the solar rays with all opake bodies , but particularly with the leaves of vegetables , which they suppose to be organs adapted to absorb them . And that as animals receive their nourishment from vegetables they also obtain in a secondary manner their phlogiston from the sun . And lastly as great masses of the mineral kingdom , which have been found in the thin crust of the earth which human labour has penetrated , have evidently been formed from the recrements of animal and vegetable bodies , these also are supposed thus to have derived their phlogiston from the sun .</p>
   <p>Another opinion concerning the sun 's rays is , that they are not luminous till they arrive at our atmosphere ; and that there uniting with some part of the air they produce combustion , and light is emitted , and that an etherial acid , yet undiscovered , is formed from this combustion .</p>
   <p>The more probable opinion is perhaps , that the sun is a phlogistic mass of matter , whose surface is in a state of combustion , which like other burning bodies emits light with immense velocity in all directions ; that these rays of light act upon all opake bodies , and combining with them either displace or produce their elementary heat , and become chemically combined with the phlogistic part of them ; for light is given out when phlogistic bodies unite with the oxygenous principle of the air , as in combustion , or in the reduction of metallic calxes ; thus in presenting to the flame of a candle a letter-wafer , ( if it be coloured with red - lead ,) at the time the red-lead becomes a metallic drop , a flash of light is perceived . Dr. Alexander Wilson very ingeniously endeavours to prove that the sun is only in a state of combustion on its surface , and that the dark spots seen on the disk are excavations or caverns through the luminous crust , some of which are 4000 miles in diameter . Phil . Trans . 1774 . Of this I shall have occasion to speak again .</p>

   <p>M. de Mairan in a paper published in the Histoire de l'Academie de Sciences , 1765 , has endeavoured to shew that the earth receives but a small part of the heat which it possesses , from the sun 's rays , but is principally heated by fires within itself . He thinks the sun is the cause of the vicissitudes of our seasons of summer and winter by a very small quantity of heat in addition to that already residing in the earth , which by emanations from the centre to the circumference renders the surface habitable , and without which , though the sun was constantly to illuminate two thirds of the globe at once , with a heat equal to that at the equator , it would soon become a mass of solid ice . His reasonings and calculations on this subject are too long and too intricate to be inserted here , but are equally curious and ingenious and carry much conviction along with them .</p>
   <p>The opinion that the center of the earth consists of a large mass of burning lava , has been espoused by Boyle , Boerhave , and many other philosophers . Some of whom considering its supposed effects on vegetation and the formation of minerals have called it a second sun . There are many arguments in support of this opinion , 1 . Because the power of the sun does not extend much beyond ten feet deep into the earth , all below being in winter and summer always of the same degree of heat , viz . 48 , which being much warmer than the mildest frost , is supposed to be sustained by some internal distant fire . Add to this however that from experiments made some years ago by Dr. Franklin the spring-water at Philadelphia appeared to be of 52 ° of heat , which seems further to confirm this opinion , since the climates in North America are supposed to be colder than those of Europe under similar degrees of latitude . 2 . Mr. De Luc in going 1359 feet perpendicular into the mines of Hartz on July the 5th , 1778 , on a very fine day found the air at the bottom a little warmer than at the top of the shaft . Phil . Trans . Vol . LXIX . p. 488 . In the mines in Hungary , which are 500 cubits deep , the heat becomes very troublesome when the miners get below 480 feet depth . Morinus de Locis subter . p. 131 . But as some other deep mines as mentioned by Mr. Kirwan are said to possess but the common heat of the earth ; and as the crust of the globe thus penetrated by human labour is so thin compared with the whole , no certain deduction can be made from these facts on either side of the question . 3 . The warm-springs in many parts of the earth at great distance from any Volcanos seem to originate from the condensation of vapours arising from water which is boiled by subterraneous fires , and cooled again in their passage through a certain length of the colder soil ; for the theory of chemical solution will not explain the equality of their heat at all seasons and through so many centuries . See note on Fucus in Vol . II . See a letter on this subject in Mr. Pilkinton 's View of Derbyshire from Dr. Darwin . 4 . From the situations of volcanos which are always found upon the summit of the highest mountains . For as these mountains have been lifted up and lose several of their uppermost strata as they rise , the lowest strata of the earth yet known appear at the tops of the highest hills ; and the beds of the Volcanos upon these hills must in consequence belong to the lowest strata of the earth , consisting perhaps of granite or basaltes , which were produced before the existance of animal or vegetable bodies , and might constitute the original nucleus of the earth , which I have supposed to have been projected from the sun , hence the volcanos themselves appear to be spiracula or chimneys belonging to great central fires . It is probably owing to the escape of the elastic vapours from these spiracula that the modern earthquakes are of such small extent compared with those of remote antiquity , of which the vestiges remain all over the globe . 5 . The great size and height of the continents , and the great size and depth of the South-sea , Atlantic , and other oceans , evince that the first earthquakes , which produced these immense changes in the globe , must have been occasioned by central fires . 6 . The very distant and expeditious communication of the shocks of some great earthquakes . The earthquake at Lisbon in 1755 was perceived in Scotland , in the Peak of Derbyshire , and in many other distant parts of Europe . The percussions of it travelled with about the velocity of sound , viz . about thirteen miles in a minute . The earthquake in 1693 extended 2600 leagues . ( Goldsmith 's History . ) These phenomena are easily explained if the central parts of the earth consist of a fluid lava , as a percussion on one part of such a fluid mass would be felt on other parts of its confining vault , like a stroke on a fluid contained in a bladder , which however gentle on one side is perceptible to the hand placed on the other ; and the velocity with which such a concussion would travel would be that of sound , or thirteen miles in a minute . For further information on this part of the subject the reader is referred to Mr. Michell 's excellent Treatise on Earthquakes in the Philos . Trans . Vol . LI . 7 . That there is a cavity at the center of the earth is made probable by the late experiments on the attraction of mountains by Mr. Maskerlyne , who supposed from other considerations that the density of the earth near the surface should be five times less than its mean density . Phil . Trans . Vol . LXV . p. 498 . But found from the attraction of the mountain Schehallien , that it is probable , the mean density of the earth is but double that of the hill . Ibid . p. 532 . Hence if the first supposition be well founded there would appear to be a cavity at the centre of considerable magnitude , from whence the immense beds and mountains of lava , toadstone , basaltes , granite , &amp; c. have been protruded . 8 . The variation of the compass can only be accounted for by supposing the central parts of the earth to consist of a fluid mass , and that part of this fluid is iron , which requiring a greater degree of heat to bring it into fusion than glass or other metals , remains a solid , and the vis inertiae of this fluid mass with the iron in it , occasions it to perform fewer revolutions than the crust of solid earth over it , and thus it is gradually left behind , and the place where the floating iron resides is pointed to by the direct or retrograde motions of the magnetic needle . This seems to have been nearly the opinion of Dr. Halley and Mr. Euler .</p>

   <p>A certain quantity of heat seems to be combined with all bodies besides the sensible quantity which gravitates like the electric fluid amongst them . This combined heat or latent heat of Dr. Black , when set at liberty by fermentation , inflammation , crystallization , freezing , or other chemical attractions producing new combinations , passes as a fluid element into the surrounding bodies . And by thawing , diffusion of neutral salts in water , melting , and other chemical solutions , a portion of heat is attracted from the bodies in vicinity and enters into or becomes combined with the new solutions .</p>
   <p>Hence a combination of metals with acids , of essential oils and acids , of alcohol and water , of acids and water , give out heat ; whilst a solution of snow in water or in acids , and of neutral salts in water , attract heat from the surrounding bodies . So the acid of nitre mixed with oil of cloves unites with it and produces a most violent flame ; the same acid of nitre poured on snow instantly dissolves it and produces the greatest degree of cold yet known , by which at Petersburgh quicksilver was first frozen in 1760 .</p>
   <p>Water may be cooled below 32º without being frozen , if it be placed on a solid floor and secured from agitation , but when thus cooled below the freezing point the least agitation turns part of it suddenly into ice , and when this sudden freezing takes place a thermometer placed in it instantly rises as some heat is given out in the act of congelation , and the ice is thus left with the same sensible degree of cold as the water had possessed before it was agitated , but is nevertheless now combined with less latent heat .</p>
   <p>A cubic inch of water thus cooled down to 32 ° mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water at 212 ° will cool it to the middle number between these two , or to 122 . But a cubic inch of ice whose sensible cold also is but 32 , mixed with an equal quantity of boiling water , will cool it six times as much as the cubic inch of cold water above-mentioned , as the ice not only gains its share of the sensible or gravitating heat of the boiling water but attracts to itself also and combines with the quantity of latent heat which it had lost at the time of its congelation .</p>
   <p>So boiling water will acquire but 212 ° of heat under the common pressure of the atmosphere , but the steam raised from it by its expansion or by its solution in the atmosphere combines with and carries away a prodigious quantity of heat which it again parts with on its condensation ; as is seen in common distillation where the large quantity of water in the worm-tub is so soon heated . Hence the evaporation of ether on a thermometer soon sinks the mercury below freezing , and hence a warmth of the air in winter frequently succeeds a shower .</p>
   <p>When the matter of heat or calorique is set at liberty from its combinations , as by inflammation , it passes into the surrounding bodies , which possess different capacities of acquiring their share of the loose or sensible heat ; thus a pint measure of cold water at 48 ° mixed with a pint of boiling water at 212 ° will cool it to the degree between these two numbers , or to 154 °, but it requires two pint measures of quicksilver at 48 ° of heat to cool one pint of water as above . These and other curious experiments are adduced by Dr. Black to evince the existance of combined or latent heat in bodies , as has been explained by some of his pupils , and well illustrated by Dr. Crawford . The world has long been in expectation of an account of his discoveries on this subject by the celebrated author himself .</p>
   <p>As this doctrine of elementary heat in its fluid and combined state is not yet universally received , I shall here add two arguments in support of it drawn from different sources , viz . from the heat given out or absorbed by the mechanical condensation or expansion of the air , and perhaps of other bodies , and from the analogy of the various phenomena of heat with those of electricity .</p>
   <p>I . If a thermometer be placed in the receiver of an air-pump , and the air hastily exhausted , the thermometer will sink some degrees , and the glass become steamy ; the same occurs in hastily admitting a part of the air again . This I suppose to be produced by the expansion of part of the air , both during the exhaustion and re-admission of it ; and that the air so expanded becomes capable of attracting from the bodies in its vicinity a part of their heat , hence the vapours contained in it and the glass receiver are for a time colder and the steam is precipitated . That the air thus parts with its moisture from the cold occasioned by its rarefaction and not simply by the rarefaction itself is evident , because in a minute or two the same rarefied air will again take up the dew deposited on the receiver ; and because water will evaporate sooner in rare than in dense air .</p>
   <p>There is a curious phenomenon similar to this observed in the fountain of Hiero constructed on a large scale at the Chemnicensian mines in Hungary . In this machine the air in a large vessel is compressed by a column of water 260 feet high , a stop-cock is then opened , and as the air issues out with great vehemence , and thus becomes immediately greatly expanded , so much cold is produced that the moisture from this stream of air is precipitated in the form of snow , and ice is formed adhering to the nosel of the cock . This remarkable circumstance is described at large with a plate of the machine in Philos . Trans . Vol . LII . for 1761 .</p>
   <p>The following experiment is related by Dr. Darwin in the Philos . Trans . Vol . LXXVIII . Having charged an air-gun as forcibly as he well could the air-cell and syringe became exceedingly hot , much more so than could be ascribed to the friction in working it ; it was then left about half an hour to cool down to the temperature of the air , and a thermometer having been previously fixed against a wall , the air was discharged in a continual stream on its bulb , and it sunk many degrees . From these three experiments of the steam in the exhausted receiver being deposited and re-absorbed , when a part of the air is exhausted or re-admitted , and the snow produced by the fountain of Hiero , and the extraordinary heat given out in charging , and the cold produced in discharging an air-gun , there is reason to conclude that when air is mechanically compressed the elementary fluid heat is pressed out of it , and that when it is mechanically expanded the same fluid heat is re-absorbed from the common mass .</p>
   <p>It is probable all other bodies as well as air attract heat from their neighbours when they are mechanically expanded , and give it out when they are mechanically condensed . Thus when a vibration of the particles of hard bodies is excited by friction or by percussion , these particles mutually recede from and approach each other reciprocally ; at the times of their recession from each other , the body becomes enlarged in bulk , and is then in a condition to attract heat from those in its vicinity with great and sudden power ; at the times of their approach to each other this heat is again given out , but the bodies in contact having in the mean while received the heat they had thus lost , from other bodies behind them , do not so suddenly or so forcibly re-absorb the heat again from the body in vibration ; hence it remains on its surface like the electric fluid on a rubbed glass globe , and for the same reason , because there is no good conductor to take it up again . Hence at every vibration more and more heat is acquired and stands loose upon the surface ; as in filing metals or rubbing glass tubes ; and thus a smith with a few strokes on a nail on his anvil can make it hot enough to light a brimstone-match ; and hence in striking flint and steel together heat enough is produced to vitrify the parts thus strucken off , the quantity of which heat is again probably increased by the new chemical combination .</p>
   <p>II . The analogy between the phenomena of the electric fluid and of heat furnishes another argument in support of the existence of heat as a gravitating fluid . 1 . They are both accumulated by friction on the excited body . 2 . They are propagated easily or with difficalty along the same classes of bodies ; with ease by metals , with less ease by water ; and with difficulty by resins , bees-wax , silk , air , and glass . Thus glass canes or canes of sealing-wax may be melted by a blow-pipe or a candle within a quarter of an inch of the fingers which hold them , without any inconvenient heat , while a pin or other metallic substance applyed to the flame of a candle so readily conducts the heat as immediately to burn the fingers . Hence clothes of silk keep the body warmer than clothes of linen of equal thickness , by confining the heat upon the body . And hence plains are so much warmer than the summits of mountains by the greater density of the air confining the acquired heat upon them . 3 . They both give out light in their passage through air , perhaps not in their passage through a vacuum . 4 . They both of them fuse or vitrify metals . 5 . Bodies after being electrized if they are mechanically extended will receive a greater quantity of electricity , as in Dr. Franklin 's experiment of the chain in the tankard ; the same seems true in respect to heat as explained above . 6 . Both heat and electricity contribute to suspend steam in the atmosphere by producing or increasing the repulsion of its particles . 7 . They both gravitate , when they have been accumulated , till they find their equilibrium .</p>
   <p>If we add to the above the many chemical experiments which receive an easy and elegant explanation from the supposed matter of heat , as employed in the works of Bergman and Lavoisier , I think we may reasonably allow of its existence as an element , occasionally combined with other bodies , and occasionally existing as a fluid , like the electric fluid gravitating amongst them , and that hence it may be propagated from the central fires of the earth to the whole mass , and contribute to preserve the mean heat of the earth , which in this country is about 48 degrees but variable from the greater or less effect of the sun 's heat in different climates , so well explained in Mr. Kirwan 's Treatise on the Temperature of different Latitudes . 1787 , Elmsly . London .</p>

   <p>The gigantic statue of Memnon in his temple at Thebes had a lyre in his hands , which many credible writers assure us , sounded when the rising sun shone upon it . Some philosophers have supposed that the sun 's light possesses a mechanical impulse , and that the sounds abovementioned might be thence produced . Mr. Michell constructed a very tender horizontal balance , as related by Dr. Priestley in his history of light and colours , for this purpose , but some experiments with this balance which I saw made by the late Dr. Powel , who threw the focus of a large reflector on one extremity of it , were not conclusive either way , as the copper leaf of the balance approached in one experiment and receded in another .</p>
   <p>There are however methods by which either a rotative or alternating motion may be produced by very moderate degrees of heat . If a straight glass tube , such as are used for barometers , be suspended horizontally before a fire , like a roasting spit , it will revolve by intervals ; for as glass is a bad conductor of heat the side next the fire becomes heated sooner than the opposite side , and the tube becomes bent into a bow with the external part of the curve towards the fire , this curve then falls down and produces a fourth part of a revolution of the glass tube , which thus revolves with intermediate pauses .</p>
   <p>Another alternating motion I have seen produced by suspending a glass tube about eight inches long with bulbs at each end on a centre like a scale beam . This curious machine is filled about one third part with purest spirit of wine , the other two thirds being a vacuum , and is called a pulse-glass , if it be placed in a box before the fire , so that either bulb , as it rises , may become shaded from the fire , and exposed to it when it descends , an alternate libration of it is produced . For spirit of wine in vacuo emits steam by a very small degree of heat , and this steam forces the spirit beneath it up into the upper bulb , which therefore descends . It is probable such a machine on a larger scale might be of use to open the doors or windows of hot-houses or mellon - frames , when the air within them should become too much heated , or might be employed in more important mechanical purposes .</p>
   <p>On travelling through a hot summer 's day in a chaise with a box covered with leather on the fore-axle-tree , I observed , as the sun shone upon the black leather , the box began to open its lid , which at noon rose above a foot , and could not without great force be pressed down ; and which gradually closed again as the sun declined in the evening . This I suppose might with still greater facility be applied to the purpose of opening melon-frames or the sashes of hot-houses .</p>
   <p>The statue of Memnon was overthrown and sawed in two by Cambyses to discover its internal structure , and is said still to exist . See Savary 's Letters on Egypt . The truncated statue is said for many centuries to have saluted the rising sun with chearful tones , and the setting sun with melancholy ones .</p>

   <p>There are eighteen species of Lampyris or glow-worm , according to Linneus , some of which are found in almost every part of the world . In many of the species the females have no wings , and are supposed to be discovered by the winged males by their shining in the night . They become much more lucid when they put themselves in motion , which would seem to indicate that their light is owing to their respiration ; in which process it is probable phosphoric acid is produced by the combination of vital air with some part of the blood , and that light is given out through their transparent bodies by this slow internal combustion .</p>
   <p>There is a fire-fly of the beetle-kind described in the Dict . Raisonné under the name of Acudia , which is said to be two inches long , and inhabits the West-Indies and South America ; the natives use them instead of candles , putting from one to three of them under a glass . Madam Merian says , that at Surinam the light of this fly is so great , that she saw sufficiently well by one of them to paint and finish one of the figures of them in her work on insects . The largest and oldest of them are said to become four inches long , and to shine like a shooting star as they fly , and are thence called Lantern-bearers . The use of this light to the insect itself seems to be that it may not fly against objects in the night ; by which contrivance these insects are enabled to procure their sustenance either by night or day , as their wants may require , or their numerous enemies permit them ; whereas some of our beetles have eyes adapted only to the night , and if they happen to come abroad too soon in the evening are so dazzled that they fly against every thing in their way .

   <p>In some seas , as particularly about the coast of Malabar , as a ship floats along , it seems during the night to be surrounded with fire , and to leave a long tract of light behind it . Whenever the sea is gently agitated it seems converted into little stars , every drop as it breaks emits light , like bodies electrified in the dark . Mr. Bomare says , that when he was at the port of Cettes in Languedoc , and bathing with a companion in the sea after a very hot day , they both appeared covered with fire after every immersion , and that laying his wet hand on the arm of his companion , who had not then dipped himself , the exact mark of his hand and fingers was seen in characters of fire . As numerous microscopic insects are found in this shining water , its light has been generally ascribed to them , though it seems probable that fish-slime in hot countries may become in such a state of incipient putrefaction as to give light , especially when by agitation it is more exposed to the air ; otherwise it is not easy to explain why agitation should be necessary to produce this marine light .

   <p>Kunckel , a native of Hamburgh , was the first who discovered to the world the process for producing phosphorus ; though Brandt and Boyle were likewise said to have previously had the art of making it . It was obtained from sal microcosmicum by evaporation in the form of an acid , but has since been found in other animal substances , as in the ashes of bones , and even in some vegetables , as in wheat flour . Keir 's chemical Dict . This phosphoric acid is like all other acids united with vital air , and requires to be treated with charcoal or phlogiston to deprive it of this air , it then becomes a kind of animal sulphur , but of so inflammable a nature , that on the access of air it takes fire spontaneously , and as it burns becomes again united with vital air , and re-assumes its form of phosphoric acid .</p>
   <p>As animal respiration seems to be a kind of slow combustion , in which it is probable that phosphoric acid is produced by the union of phosphorus with the vital air , so it is also probable that phosphoric acid is produced in the excretory or respiratory vessels of luminous insects , as the glow-worm and fire-fly , and some marine insects . From the same principle I suppose the light from putrid fish , as from the heads of hadocks , and from putrid veal , and from rotten wood in a certain state of their putrefaction , is produced , and phosphorus thus slowly combined with air is changed into phosphoric acid . The light from the Bolognian stone , and from calcined shells , and from white paper , and linen after having been exposed for a time to the sun 's light , seem to produce either the phosphoric or some other kind of acid from the sulphurous or phlogistic matter which they contain . See note on Beccari 's shells . l. 180 .</p>
   <p>There is another process seems similar to this slow combustion , and that is bleaching . By the warmth and light of the sun the water sprinkled upon linen or cotton cloth seems to be decomposed , ( if we credit the theory of M. Lavoisier ,) and a part of the vital air thus set at liberty and uncombined and not being in its elastic form , more easily dissolves the colouring or phlogistic matter of the cloth , and produces a new acid , which is itself colourless , or is washed out of the cloth by water . The new process of bleaching confirms a part of this theory , for by uniting much vital air to marine acid by distilling it from manganese , on dipping the cloth to be bleached in water repleat with this super-aerated marine acid , the colouring matter disappears immediately , sooner indeed in cotton than in linen . See note XXXIV .</p>
   <p>There is another process which I suspect bears analogy to these above - mentioned , and that is the rancidity of animal fat , as of bacon ; if bacon be hung up in a warm kitchen , with much salt adhering on the outside of it , the fat part of it soon becomes yellow and rancid ; if it be washed with much cold water after it has imbibed the salt , and just before it is hung up , I am well informed , that it will not become rancid , or in very slight degrees . In the former case I imagine the salt on the surface of the bacon attracts water during the cold of the night , which is evaporated during the day , and that in this evaporation a part of the water becomes decomposed , as in bleaching , and its vital air uniting with greater facility in its unelastic state with the animal fat , produces an acid , perhaps of the phosphoric kind , which being of a fixed nature lies upon the bacon , giving it the yellow colour and rancid taste . It is remarkable that the super-aerated marine acid does not bleach living animal substances , at least it did not whiten a part of my hand which I for some minutes exposed to it .</p>

   <p>The expansive force of steam was known in some degree to the antients , Hero of Alexandria describes an application of it to produce a rotative motion by the re-action of steam issuing from a sphere mounted upon an axis , through two small tubes bent into tangents , and issuing from the opposite sides of the equatorial diameter of the sphere , the sphere was supplied with steam by a pipe communicating with a pan of boiling water , and entering the sphere at one of its poles .</p>
   <p>A french writer about the year 1630 describes a method of raising water to the upper part of a house by filling a chamber with steam , and suffering it to condense of itself , but it seems to have been mere theory , as his method was scarcely practicable as he describes it . In 1655 the Marquis of Worcester mentions a method of raising water by fire in his Century of Inventions , but he seems only to have availed himself of the expansive force and not to have known the advantages arising from condensing the steam by an injection of cold water . This latter and most important improvement seems to have been made by Capt . Savery sometime prior to 1698 , for in that year his patent for the use of that invention was confirmed by act of parliament . This gentleman appears to have been the first who reduced the machine to practice and exhibited it in an useful form . This method consisted only in expelling the air from a vessel by steam and condensing the steam by an injection of cold water , which making a vacuum , the pressure of the atmosphere forced the water to ascend into the steam-vessel through a pipe of 24 to 26 feet high , and by the admission of dense steam from the boiler , forcing the water in the steam-vessel to ascend to the height desired . This construction was defective because it required very strong vessels to resist the force of the steam , and because an enormous quantity of steam was condensed by coming in contact with the cold water in the steam-vessel .</p>
   <p>About or soon after that time M. Papin attempted a steam-engine on similar principles but rather more defective in its construction .</p>
   <p>The next improvement was made very soon afterwards by Messrs. Newcomen and Cawley of Dartmouth , it consisted in employing for the steam-vessel a hollow cylinder , shut at bottom and open at top , furnished with a piston sliding easily up and down in it , and made tight by oakum or hemp , and covered with water . This piston is suspended by chains from one end of a beam , moveable upon an axis in the middle of its length , to the other end of this beam are suspended the pump-rods .</p>
   <p>The danger of bursting the vessels was avoided in this machine , as however high the water was to be raised it was not necessary to increase the density of the steam but only to enlarge the diameter of the cylinder .</p>
   <p>Another advantage was , that the cylinder not being made so cold as in Savary 's method , much less steam was lost in filling it after each condensation .</p>
   <p>The machine however still remained imperfect , for the cold water thrown into the cylinder acquired heat from the steam it condensed , and being in a vessel exhausted of air it produced steam itself , which in part resisted the action of the atmosphere on the piston ; were this remedied by throwing in more cold water the destruction of steam in the next filling of the cylinder would be proportionally increased . It has therefore in practice been found adviseable not to load these engines with columns of water weighing more than seven pounds for each square inch of the area of the piston . The bulk of water when converted into steam remained unknown until Mr. J. Watt , then of Glasgow , in 1764 , determined it to be about 1800 times more rare than water . It soon occurred to Mr. Watt that a perfect engine would be that in which no steam should be condensed in filling the cylinder , and in which the steam should be so perfectly cooled as to produce nearly a perfect vacuum .</p>
   <p>Mr. Watt having ascertained the degree of heat in which water boiled in vacuo , and under progressive degrees of pressure , and instructed by Dr. Black 's discovery of latent heat , having calculated the quantity of cold water necessary to condense certain quantities of steam so far as to produce the exhaustion required , he made a communication from the cylinder to a cold vessel previously exhausted of air and water , into which the steam rushed by its elasticity , and became immediately condensed . He then adapted a cover to the cylinder and admitted steam above the piston to press it down instead of air , and instead of applying water he used oil or grease to fill the pores of the oakum and to lubricate the cylinder .</p>
   <p>He next applied a pump to extract the injection water , the condensed steam , and the air , from the condensing vessel , every stroke of the engine .</p>
   <p>To prevent the cooling of the cylinder by the contact of the external air , he surrounded it with a case containing steam , which he again protected by a covering of matters which conduct heat slowly .</p>
   <p>This construction presented an easy means of regulating the power of the engine , for the steam being the acting power , as the pipe which admits it from the boiler is more or less opened , a greater or smaller quantity can enter during the time of a stroke , and consequently the engine can act with exactly the necessary degree of energy .</p>
   <p>Mr. Watt gained a patent for his engine in 1768 , but the further persecution of his designs were delayed by other avocations till 1775 , when in conjunction with Mr. Boulton of Soho near Birmingham , numerous experiments were made on a large scale by their united ingenuity , and great improvements added to the machinery , and an act of parliament obtained for the prolongation of their patent for twenty-five years , they have since that time drained many of the deep mines in Cornwall , which but for the happy union of such genius must immediately have ceased to work . One of these engines works a pump of eighteen inches diameter , and upwards of 100 fathom or 600 feet high , at the rate of ten to twelve strokes of seven feet long each , in a minute , and that with one fifth part of the coals which a common engine would have taken to do the same work . The power of this engine may be easier comprehended by saying that it raised a weight equal to 81000 pounds 80 feet high in a minute , which is equal to the combined action of 200 good horses . In Newcomen 's engine this would have required a cylinder of the enormous diameter of 120 inches or ten feet , but as in this engine of Mr. Watt and Mr. Boulton the steam acts , and a vacuum is made , alternately above and below the piston , the power exerted is double to what the same cylinder would otherways produce , and is further augmented by an inequality in the length of the two ends of the lever .</p>
   <p>These gentlemen have also by other contrivances applied their engines to the turning of mills for almost every purpose , of which that great pile of machinery the Albion Mill is a well known instance . Forges , slitting mills , and other great works are erected where nature has furnished no running water , and future times may boast that this grand and useful engine was invented and perfected in our own country .</p>
   <p>Since the above article went to the press the Albion Mill is no more ; it is supposed to have been set on fire by interested or malicious incendaries , and is burnt to the ground . Whence London has lost the credit and the advantage of possessing the most powerful machine in the world !</p>

   <p>The cause of the expansion of water during its conversion into ice is not yet well ascertained , it was supposed to have been owing to the air being set at liberty in the act of congelation which was before dissolved in the water , and the many air bubbles in ice were thought to countenance this opinion . But the great force with which ice expands during its congelation , so as to burst iron bombs and coehorns , according to the experiments of Major Williams at Quebec , invalidates this idea of the cause of it , and may sometime be brought into use as a means of breaking rocks in mining , or projecting cannon-balls , or for other mechanical purposes , if the means of producing congelation should ever be discovered to be as easy as the means of producing combustion .</p>
   <p>Mr. de Mairan attributes the increase of bulk of frozen water to the different arrangement of the particles of it in crystallization , as they are constantly joined at an angle of 60 degrees ; and must by this disposition he thinks occupy a greater volume than if they were parallel . He found the augmentation of the water during freezing to amount to one-fourteenth , one-eighteenth , one-nineteenth , and when the water was previously purged of air to only one-twenty-second part . He adds that a piece of ice , which was at first only one-fourteenth part specifically lighter than water , on being exposed some days to the frost became one-twelfth lighter than water . Hence he thinks ice by being exposed to greater cold still increases in volume , and to this attributes the bursting of ice in ponds and on the glaciers . See Lewis 's Commerce of Arts , p. 257. and the note on Muschus in the other volume of this work .</p>
   <p>This expansion of ice well accounts for the greater mischief done by vernal frosts attended with moisture , ( as by hoar-frosts ,) than by the dry frosts called black frosts . Mr. Lawrence in a letter to Mr. Bradley complains that the dale-mist attended with a frost on may-day had destroyed all his tender fruits ; though there was a sharper frost the night before without a mist , that did him no injury ; and adds , that a garden not a stone 's throw from his own on a higher situation , being above the dale-mist , had received no damage . Bradley , Vol . II . p. 232 .</p>
   <p>Mr. Hunter by very curious experiments discovered that the living principle in fish , in vegetables , and even in eggs and seeds , possesses a power of resisting congelation . Phil . Trans . There can be no doubt but that the exertions of animals to avoid the pain of cold may produce in them a greater quantity of heat , at least for a time , but that vegetables , eggs , or seeds , should possess such a quality is truly wonderful . Others have imagined that animals possess a power of preventing themselves from becoming much warmer than 98 degrees of heat , when immersed in an atmosphere above that degree of heat . It is true that the increased exhalation from their bodies will in some measure cool them , as much heat is carried off by the evaporation of fluids , but this is a chemical not an animal process . The experiments made by those who continued many minutes in the air of a room heated so much above any natural atmospheric heat , do not seem conclusive , as they remained in it a less time than would have been necessary to have heated a mass of beef of the same magnitude , and the circulation of the blood in living animals , by perpetually bringing new supplies of fluid to the skin , would prevent the external surface from becoming hot much sooner than the whole mass . And thirdly , there appears no power of animal bodies to produce cold in diseases , as in scarlet fever , in which the increased action of the vessels of the skin produces heat and contributes to exhaust the animal power already too much weakened .</p>
   <p>It has been thought by many that frosts meliorate the ground , and that they are in general salubrious to mankind . In respect to the former it is now well known that ice or snow contain no nitrous particles , and though frost by enlarging the bulk of moist clay leaves it softer for a time after the thaw , yet as soon as the water exhales , the clay becomes as hard as before , being pressed together by the incumbent atmosphere , and by its self-attraction , called setting by the potters . Add to this that on the coasts of Africa , where frost is unknown , the fertility of the soil is almost beyond our conceptions of it . In respect to the general salubrity of frosty seasons the bills of mortality are an evidence in the negative , as in long frosts many weakly and old people perish from debility occasioned by the cold , and many classes of birds and other wild animals are benumbed by the cold or destroyed by the consequent scarcity of food , and many tender vegetables perish from the degree of cold .</p>
   <p>I do not think it should be objected to this doctrine that there are moist days attended with a brisk cold wind when no visible ice appears , and which are yet more disagreeable and destructive than frosty weather . For on these days the cold moisture , which is deposited on the skin is there evaporated and thus produces a degree of cold perhaps greater than the milder frosts . Whence even in such days both the disagreeable sensations and insalubrious effects belong to the cause abovementioned , viz . the intensity of the cold . Add to this that in these cold moist days as we pass along or as the wind blows upon us , a new sheet of cold water is as it were perpetually applied to us and hangs upon our bodies , now as water is 800 times denser than air and is a much better conductor of heat , we are starved with cold like those who go into a cold bath , both by the great number of particles in contact with the skin and their greater facility of receiving our heat .</p>
   <p>It may nevertheless be true that snows of long duration in our winters may be less injurious to vegetation than great rains and shorter frosts , for two reasons . 1 . Because great rains carry down many thousand pounds worth of the best part of the manure off the lands into the sea , whereas snow dissolves more gradually and thence carries away less from the land ; any one may distinguish a snow-flood from a rain-flood by the transparency of the water . Hence hills or fields with considerable inclination of surface should be ploughed horizontally that the furrows may stay the water from showers till it deposits its mud . 2 . Snow protects vegetables from the severity of the frost , since it is always in a state of thaw where it is in contact with the earth ; as the earth 's heat is about 48 ° and the heat of thawing snow is 32 ° the vegetables between them are kept in a degree of heat about 40 , by which many of them are preserved .

   <p>ELECTRIC POINTS .</p>
   <p>There was an idle dispute whether knobs or points were preferable on the top of conductors for the defence of houses . The design of these conductors is to permit the electric matter accumulated in the clouds to pass through them into the earth in a smaller continued stream as the cloud approaches , before it comes to what is termed striking distance ; now as it is well known that accumulated electricity will pass to points at a much greater distance than it will to knobs there can be no doubt of their preference ; and it would seem that the finer the point and the less liable to become rusty the better , as it would take off the lightening while it was still at a greater distance , and by that means preserve a greater extent of building ; the very extremity of the point should be of pure silver or gold , and might be branched into a kind of brush , since one small point can not be supposed to receive so great a quantity as a thicker bar might conduct into the earth .</p>
   <p>If an insulated metallic ball is armed with a point , like a needle , projecting from one part of it , the electric fluid will be seen in the dark to pass off from this point , so long as the ball is kept supplied with electricity . The reason of this is not difficult to comprehend , every part of the electric atmosphere which surrounds the insulated ball is attracted to that ball by a large surface of it , whereas the electric atmosphere which is near the extremity of the needle is attracted to it by only a single point , in consequence the particles of electric matter near the surface of the ball approach towards it and push off by their greater gravitation the particles of electric matter over the point of the needle in a continued stream .</p>
   <p>Something like this happens in respect to the diffusion of oil on water from a pointed cork , an experiment which was many years ago shewn me by Dr. Franklin ; he cut a piece of cork about the size of a letter-wafer and left on one edge of it a point about a sixth of an inch in length projecting as a tangent to the circumference . This was dipped in oil and thrown on a pond of water and continued to revolve as the oil left the point for a great many minutes . The oil descends from the floating cork upon the water being diffused upon it without friction and perhaps without contact ; but its going off at the point so forcibly as to make the cork revolve in a contrary direction seems analogous to the departure of the electric fluid from points .</p>
   <p>Can any thing similar to either of these happen in respect to the earth 's atmosphere and give occasion to the breezes on the tops of mountains , which may be considered as points on the earths circumference ?</p>
   <p>FAIRY-RINGS .</p>
   <p>There is a phenomenon supposed to be electric which is yet unaccounted for , I mean the Fairy-rings , as they are called , so often seen on the grass . The numerous flashes of lightning which occur every summer are , I believe , generally discharged on the earth , and but seldom ( if ever ) from one cloud to another . Moist trees are the most frequent conductors of these flashes of lightning , and I am informed by purchasers of wood that innumerable trees are thus cracked and injured . At other times larger parts or prominences of clouds gradually sinking as they move along , are discharged on the moisture parts of grassy plains . Now this knob or corner of a cloud in being attracted by the earth will become nearly cylindrical , as loose wool would do when drawn out into a thread , and will strike the earth with a stream of electricity perhaps two or ten yards in diameter . Now as a stream of electricity displaces the air it passes through , it is plain no part of the grass can be burnt by it , but just the external ring of this cylinder where the grass can have access to the air , since without air nothing can be calcined . This earth after having been so calcined becomes a richer soil , and either funguses or a bluer grass for many years mark the place . That lightning displaces the air in its passage is evinced by the loud crack that succeeds it , which is owing to the sides of the aerial vacuum clapping together when the lightning is withdrawn . That nothing will calcine without air is now well understood from the acids produced in the burning of phlogistic substances , and may be agreeably seen by suspending a paper on an iron prong and putting it into the centre of the blaze of an iron-furnace ; it may be held there some seconds and may be again withdrawn without its being burnt , if it be passed quickly into the flame and out again through the external part of it which is in contact with the air . I know some circles of many yards diameter of this kind near Foremark in Derbyshire which annually produce large white funguses and stronger grass , and have done so , I am informed , above thirty years . This increased fertility of the ground by calcination or charring , and its continuing to operate so many years is well worth the attention of the farmer , and shews the use of paring and burning new turf in agriculture , which produces its effect not so much by the ashes of the vegetable fibres as by charring the soil which adheres to them .</p>
   <p>These situations , whether from eminence or from moisture , which were proper once to attract and discharge a thunder-cloud , are more liable again to experience the same . Hence many fairy-rings are often seen near each other either without intersecting each other , as I saw this summer in a garden in Nottinghamshire , or intersecting each other as described on Arthur 's seat near Edinburgh in the Edinb .

   <p>A tree is properly speaking a family or swarm of buds , each bud being an individual plant , for if one of these buds be torn or cut out and planted in the earth with a glass cup inverted over it to prevent its exhalation from being at first greater than its power of absorption , it will produce a tree similar to its parent ; each bud has a leaf , which is its lungs , appropriated to it , and the bark of the tree is a congeries of the roots of these individual buds , whence old hollow trees are often seen to have some branches flourish with vigour after the internal wood is almost intirely decayed and vanished . According to this idea Linneus has observed that trees and shrubs are roots above ground , for if a tree be inverted leaves will grow from the root-part and roots from the trunk-part . Phil . Bot p. 39 . Hence it appears that vegetables have two methods of propagating themselves , the oviparous as by seeds , and the viviparous as by their buds and bulbs , and that the individual plants , whether from seeds or buds or bulbs , are all annual productions like many kinds of insects as the silk-worm , the parent perishing in the autumn after having produced an embryon , which lies in a torpid state during the winter , and is matured in the succeeding summer . Hence Linneus names buds and bulbs the winter-cradles of the plant or hybernacula , and might have given the same term to seeds . In warm climates few plants produce buds , as the vegetable life can be compleated in one summer , and hence the hybernacle is not wanted ; in cold climates also some plants do not produce buds , as philadelphus , frangula , viburnum , ivy , heath , wood-nightshade , rue , geranium .</p>
   <p>The bulbs of plants are another kind of winter-cradle , or hybernacle , adhering to the descending trunk , and are found in the perennial herbaceous plants which are too tender to bear the cold of the winter . The production of these subterraneous winter lodges , is not yet perhaps clearly understood , they have been distributed by Linneus according to their forms into scaly , solid , coated , and jointed bulbs , which however does not elucidate their manner of production . As the buds of trees may be truly esteemed individual annual plants , their roots constituting the bark of the tree , it follows that these roots ( viz . of each individual bud ) spread themselves over the last years bark , making a new bark over the old one , and thence descending cover with a new bark the old roots also in the same manner . A similar circumstance I suppose to happen in some herbaceous plants , that is , a new bark is annually produced over the old root , and thus for some years at least the old root or caudex increases in size and puts up new stems . As these roots increase in size the central part I suppose changes like the internal wood of a tree and does not possess any vegetable life , and therefore gives out no fibres or rootlets , and hence appears bitten off , as in valerian , plantain , and devil'shYpppHeNbit . And this decay of the central part of the root I suppose has given occasion to the belief of the root-fibres drawing down the bulb so much insisted on by Mr. Milne in his Botanical Dictionary , Art . Bulb .</p>
   <p>From the observations and drawings of various kinds of bulbous roots at different times of their growth , sent me by a young lady of nice observation , it appears probable that all bulbous roots properly so called perish annually in this climate : Bradley , Miller , and the Author of Spectacle de la Nature , observe that the tulip annually renews its bulb , for the stalk of the old flower is found under the old dry coat but on the outside of the new bulb . This large new bulb is the flowering bulb , but besides this there are other small new bulbs produced between the coats of this large one but from the same caudex , ( or circle from which the root-fibres spring ;) these small bulbs are leaf-bearing bulbs , and renew themselves annually with increasing size till they bear flowers .</p>
   <p>Miss —— favoured me with the following curious experiment : She took a small tulip-root out of the earth when the green leaves were sufficiently high to show the flower , and placed it in a glass of water ; the leaves and flower soon withered and the bulb became wrinkled and soft , but put out one small side bulb and three bulbs beneath descending an inch into the water by long processes from the caudex , the old bulb in some weeks intirely decayed ; on dissecting this monster , the middle descending bulb was found by its process to adhere to the caudex and to the old flower-stem , and the side ones were separated from the flower - stem by a few shrivelled coats but adhered to the caudex . Whence she concludes that these last were off-sets or leaf-bulbs which should have been seen between the coats of the new flower-bulb if it had been left to grow in the earth , and that the middle one would have been the new flower-bulb . In some years ( perhaps in wet seasons ) the florists are said to lose many of their tulip-roots by a similar process , the new leaf-bulbs being produced beneath the old ones by an elongation of the caudex without any new flower-bulbs .</p>
   <p>By repeated dissections she observes that the leaf-bulbs or off-sets of tulip , crocus , gladiolus , fritillary , are renewed in the same manner as the flowering-bulbs , contrary to the opinion of many writers ; this new leaf-bulb is formed on the inside of the coats from whence the leaves grow , and is more or less advanced in size as the outer coats and leaves are more or less shrivelled . In examining tulip , iris , hyacinth , hare - bell , the new bulb was invariably found between the flower-stem and the base of the innermost leaf of those roots which had flowered , and inclosed by the base of the innermost leaf in those roots which had not flowered , in both cases adhering to the caudex or fleshy circle from which the root-fibres spring .</p>
   <p>Hence it is probable that the bulbs of hyacinths are renewed annually , but that this is performed from the caudex within the old bulb , the outer coat of which does not so shrivel as in crocus and fritillary and hence this change is not so apparent . But I believe as soon as the flower is advanced the new bulbs may be seen on dissection , nor does the annual increase of the size of the root of cyclamen and of aletris capensis militate against this annual renewal of them , since the leaf - bulbs or off-sets , as described above , are increased in size as they are annually renewed .

   <p>Dr. Alexander Wilson , Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow , published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1774 , demonstrating that the spots in the sun 's disk are real cavities , excavations through the luminous material , which covers the other parts of the sun 's surface . One of these cavities he found to be about 4000 miles deep and many times as wide . Some objections were made to this doctrine by M. De la Laude in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1776 , which however have been ably answered by Professor Wilson in reply in the Philos . Trans . for 1783 . Keil observes , in his Astronomical Lectures , p. 44 , “ We frequently see spots in the sun which are larger and broader not only than Europe or Africa , but which even equal , if they do not exceed , the surface of the whole terraqueous globe . ” Now that these cavities are made in the sun 's body by a process of nature similar to our earthquakes does not seem improbable on several accounts . 1 . Because from this discovery of Dr. Wilson it appears that the internal parts of the sun are not in a state of inflammation or of ejecting light , like the external part or luminous ocean which covers it ; and hence that a greater degree of heat or inflammation and consequent expansion or explosion may occasionally be produced in its internal or dark nucleus . 2 . Because the solar spots or cavities are frequently increased or diminished in size . 3 . New ones are often produced . 4 . And old ones vanish . 5 . Because there are brighter or more luminous parts of the sun 's disk , called faculae by Scheiner and Hevelius , which would seem to be volcanos in the sun , or , as Dr. Wilson calls them , “ eructations of matter more luminous than that which covers the sun 's surface . ” 6 . To which may be added that all the planets added together with their satellites do not amount to more than one six hundred and fiftieth part of the mass of the sun according to Sir Isaac Newton .</p>
   <p>Now if it could be supposed that the planets were originally thrown out of the sun by larger sun-quakes than those frequent ones which occasion these spots or excavations above-mentioned , what would happen ? 1 . According to the observations and opinion of Mr. Herschel the sun itself and all its planets are moving forwards round some other centre with an unknown velocity , which may be of opake matter corresponding with the very antient and general idea of a chaos . Whence if a ponderous planet , as Saturn , could be supposed to be projected from the sun by an explosion , the motion of the sun itself might be at the same time disturbed in such a manner as to prevent the planet from falling again into it . 2 . As the sun revolves round its own axis its form must be that of an oblate spheroid like the earth , and therefore a body projected from its surface perpendicularly upwards from that surface would not rise perpendicularly from the sun 's centre , unless it happened to be projected exactly from either of its poles or from its equator . Whence it may not be necessary that a planet if thus projected from the sun by explosion should again fall into the sun . 3 . They would part from the sun 's surface with the velocity with which that surface was moving , and with the velocity acquired by the explosion , and would therefore move round the sun in the same direction in which the sun rotates on its axis , and perform eliptic orbits . 4 . All the planets would move the same way round the sun , from this first motion acquired at leaving its surface , but their orbits would be inclined to each other according to the distance of the part , where they were thrown out , from the sun 's equator . Hence those which were ejected near the sun 's equator would have orbits but little inclined to each other , as the primary planets ; the plain of all whose orbits are inclined but seven degrees and a half from each other . Others which were ejected near the sun 's poles would have much more eccentric orbits , as they would partake so much less of the sun 's rotatory motion at the time they parted from his surface , and would therefore be carried further from the sun by the velocity they had gained by the explosion which ejected them , and become comets . 5 . They would all obey the same laws of motion in their revolutions round the sun ; this has been determined by astronomers , who have demonstrated that they move through equal areas in equal times . 6 . As their annual periods would depend on the height they rose by the explosion , these would differ in them all . 7 . As their diurnal revolutions would depend on one side of the exploded matter adhering more than the other at the time it was torn off by the explosion , these would also differ in the different planets , and not bear any proportion to their annual periods . Now as all these circumstances coincide with the known laws of the planetary system , they serve to strengthen this conjecture .</p>
   <p>This coincidence of such a variety of circumstances induced M. de Buffon to suppose that the planets were all struck off from the sun 's surface by the impact of a large comet , such as approached so near the sun 's disk , and with such amazing velocity , in the year 1680 , and is expected to return in 2255 . But Mr. Buffon did not recollect that these comets themselves are only planets with more eccentric orbits , and that therefore it must be asked , what had previously struck off these comets from the sun 's body ? 2 . That if all these planets were struck off from the sun at the same time , they must have been so near as to have attracted each other and have formed one mass : 3 . That we shall want new causes for separating the secondary planets from the primary ones , and must therefore look out for some other agent , as it does not appear how the impulse of a comet could have made one planet roll round another at the time they both of them were driven off from the surface of the sun .</p>
   <p>If it should be asked , why new planets are not frequently ejected from the sun ? it may be answered , that after many large earthquakes many vents are left for the elastic vapours to escape , and hence , by the present appearance of the surface of our earth , earthquakes prodigiously larger than any recorded in history have existed ; the same circumstances may have affected the sun , on whose surface there are appearances of volcanos , as described above . Add to this , that some of the comets , and even the georgium sidus , may , for ought we know to the contrary , have been emitted from the sun in more modern days , and have been diverted from their course , and thus prevented from returning into the sun , by their approach to some of the older planets , which is somewhat countenanced by the opinion several philosophers have maintained , that the quantity of matter of the sun has decreased . Dr. Halley observed , that by comparing the proportion which the periodical time of the moon bore to that of the sun in former times , with the proportion between them at present , that the moon is found to be somewhat accelerated in respect to the sun . Pemberton 's View of Sir Isaac Newton , p. 247 . And so large is the body of this mighty luminary , that all the planets thus thrown out of it would make scarcely any perceptible diminution of it , as mentioned above . The cavity mentioned above , as measured by Dr. Wilson of 4000 miles in depth , not penetrating an hundredth part of the sun 's semi-diameter ; and yet , as its width was many times greater than its depth , was large enough to contain a greater body than our terrestrial world .</p>
   <p>I do not mean to conceal , that from the laws of gravity unfolded by Sir Isaac Newton , supposing the sun to be a sphere and to have no progressive motion , and not liable itself to be disturbed by the supposed projection of the planets from it , that such planets must return into the sun . The late Rev . William Ludlam , of Leicester , whose genius never met with reward equal to its merits , in a letter to me , dated January , 1787 , after having shewn , as mentioned above , that planets so projected from the sun would return to it , adds , “ That a body as large as the moon so projected , would disturb the motion of the earth in its orbit , is certain ; but the calculation of such disturbing forces is difficult . The body in some circumstances might become a satellite , and both move round their common centre of gravity , and that centre be carried in an annual orbit round the sun . ”</p>
   <p>There are other circumstances which might have concurred at the time of such supposed explosions , which would render this idea not impossible . 1 . The planets might be thrown out of the sun at the time the sun itself was rising from chaos , and be attracted by other suns in their vicinity rising at the same time out of chaos , which would prevent them from returning into the sun . 2 . The new planet in its course or ascent from the sun , might explode and eject a satellite , or perhaps more than one , and thus by its course being affected might not return into the sun . 3 . If more planets were ejected at the same time from the sun , they might attract and disturb each others course at the time they left the body of the sun , or very soon afterwards , when they would be so much nearer each other .</p>

   <p>From having observed that many of the highest mountains of the world consist of lime-stone replete with shells , and that these mountains bear the marks of having been lifted up by subterraneous fires from the interior parts of the globe ; and as lime-stone replete with shells is found at the bottom of many of our deepest mines some philosophers have concluded that the nucleus of the earth was for many ages covered with water which was peopled with its adapted animals ; that the shells and bones of these animals in a long series of time produced solid strata in the ocean surrounding the original nucleus .</p>
   <p>These strata consist of the accumulated exuviae of shell-fish , the animals perished age after age but their shells remained , and in progression of time produced the amazing quantities of lime-stone which almost cover the earth . Other marine animals called coralloids raised walls and even mountains by the congeries of their calcareous habitations , these perpendicular corralline rocks make some parts of the Southern Ocean highly dangerous , as appears in the journals of Capt . Cook . From contemplating the immense strata of lime-stone , both in respect to their extent and thickness , formed from these shells of animals , philosophers have been led to conclude that much of the water of the sea has been converted into calcareous earth by passing through their organs of digestion . The formation of calcareous earth seems more particularly to be an animal process as the formation of clay belongs to the vegetable economy ; thus the shells of crabs and other testaceous fish are annually reproduced from the mucous membrane beneath them ; the shells of eggs are first a mucous membrane , and the calculi of the kidneys and those found in all other parts of our system which sometimes contain calcareous earth , seem to originate from inflamed membranes ; the bones themselves consist of calcareous earth united with the phosphoric or animal acid , which may be separated by dissolving the ashes of calcined bones in the nitrous acid ; the various secretions of animals , as their saliva and urine , abound likewise with calcareous earth , as appears by the incrustations about the teeth and the sediments of urine . It is probable that animal mucus is a previous process towards the formation of calcareous earth ; and that all the calcareous earth in the world which is seen in lime-stones , marbles , spars , alabasters , marls , ( which make up the greatest part of the earth 's crust , as far as it has yet been penetrated ,) have been formed originally by animal and vegetable bodies from the mass of water , and that by these means the solid part of the terraqueous globe has perpetually been in an increasing state and the water perpetually in a decreasing one .</p>
   <p>After the mountains of shells and other recrements of aquatic animals were elevated above the water the upper heaps of them were gradually dissolved by rains and dews and oozing through were either perfectly crystallized in smaller cavities and formed calcareous spar , or were imperfectly crystallized on the roofs of larger cavities and produced stalactes ; or mixing with other undissolved shells beneath them formed marbles , which were more or less crystallized and more or less pure ; or lastly , after being dissolved , the water was exhaled from them in such a manner that the external parts became solid , and forming an arch prevented the internal parts from approaching each other so near as to become solid , and thus chalk was produced . I have specimens of chalk formed at the root of several stalactites , and in their central parts ; and of other stalactites which are hollow like quills from a similar cause , viz . from the external part of the stalactite hardening first by its evaporation , and thus either attracting the internal dissolved particles to the crust , or preventing them from approaching each other so as to form a solid body . Of these I saw many hanging from the arched roof of a cellar under the high street in Edinburgh .</p>
   <p>If this dissolved limestone met with vitriolic acid it was converted into alabaster , parting at the same time with its fixable air . If it met with the fluor acid it became fluor ; if with the siliceous acid , flint ; and when mixed with clay and sand , or either of them , acquires the name of marl . And under one or other of these forms composes a great part of the solid globe of the earth .</p>
   <p>Another mode in which limestone appears is in the form of round granulated particles , but slightly cohering together ; of this kind a bed extends over Lincoln heath , perhaps twenty miles long by ten wide . The form of this calcareous sand , its angles having been rubbed off , and the flatness of its bed , evinces that that part of the country was so formed under water , the particles of sand having thus been rounded , like all other rounded pebbles . This round form of calcareous sand and of other larger pebbles is produced under water , partly by their being more or less soluble in water , and hence the angular parts become dissolved , first , by their exposing a larger surface to the action of the menstruum , and secondly , from their attrition against each other by the streams or tides , for a great length of time , successively as they were collected , and perhaps when some of them had not acquired their hardest state .</p>
   <p>This calcareous sand has generally been called ketton-stone and believed to resemble the spawn of fish , it has acquired a form so much rounder than siliceous sand from its being of so much softer a texture and also much more soluble in water . There are other soft calcareous stones called tupha which are deposited from water on mosses , as at Matlock , from which moss it is probable the water may receive something which induces it the readier to part with its earth .</p>
   <p>In some lime-stones the living animals seem to have been buried as well as their shells during some great convulsion of nature , these shells contain a black coaly substance within them , in others some phlogiston or volatile alcali from the bodies of the dead animals remains mixed with the stone , which is then called liver-stone as it emits a sulphurous smell on being struck , and there is a stratum about six inches thick extends a considerable way over the iron ore at Wingerworth near Chesterfield in Derbyshire which seems evidently to have been formed from the shells of fresh-water muscles .</p>
   <p>There is however another source of calcareous earth besides the aquatic one above described and that is from the recrements of land animals and vegetables as found in marls , which consist of various mixtures of calcareous earth , sand , and clay , all of them perhaps principally from vegetable origin .</p>
   <p>Dr. Hutton is of opinion that the rocks of marble have been softened by fire into a fluid mass , which he thinks under immense pressure might be done without the escape of their carbonic acid or fixed air . Edinb . Transact . Vol . I . If this ingenious idea be allowed it might account for the purity of some white marbles , as during their fluid state there might be time for their partial impurities , whether from the bodies of the animals which produced the shells or from other extraneous matter , either to sublime to the uppermost part of the stratum or to subside to the lowermost part of it . As a confirmation of this theory of Dr. Hutton 's it may be added that some calcareous stones are found mixed with lime , and have thence lost a part of their fixed air or carbonic gas , as the bath-stone , and on that account hardens on being exposed to the air , and mixed with sulphur produces calcareous liver of sulphur . Falconer on Bath-water . Vol . I. p. 156. and p. 257 . Mr. Monnet found lime in powder in the mountains of Auvergne , and suspected it of volcanic origin . Kirwan 's Min . p. 22 .</p>

   <p>Where woods have repeatedly grown and perished morasses are in process of time produced , and by their long roots fill up the interstices till the whole becomes for many yards deep a mass of vegetation . This fact is curiously verified by an account given many years ago by the Earl of Cromartie , of which the following is a short abstract .</p>
   <p>In the year 1651 the EARL OF CROMARTIE being then nineteen years of age saw a plain in the parish of Lockburn covered over with a firm standing wood , which was so old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon them but the bark was totally thrown off , which he was there informed by the old countrymen was the universal manner in which fir-woods terminated , and that in twenty or thirty years the trees would cast themselves up by the roots . About fifteen years after he had occasion to travel the same way and observed that there was not a tree nor the appearance of a root of any of them ; but in their place the whole plain where the wood stood was covered with a flat green moss or morass , and on asking the country people what was become of the wood he was informed that no one had been at the trouble to carry it away , but that it had all been overturned by the wind , that the trees lay thick over each other , and that the moss or bog had overgrown the whole timber , which they added was occasioned by the moisture which came down from the high hills above it and stagnated upon the plain , and that nobody could yet pass over it , which however his Lordship was so incautious as to attempt and slipt up to the arm-pits . Before the year 1699 that whole piece of ground was become a solid moss wherein the peasants then dug turf or peat , which however was not yet of the best sort . Philos . Trans . No . 330 . Abridg . Vol . V. p. 272 .</p>
   <p>Morasses in great length of time undergo variety of changes , first by elutriation , and afterwards by fermentation , and the consequent heat . 1 . By water perpetually oozing through them the most soluble parts are first washed away , as the essential salts , these together with the salts from animal recrements are carried down the rivers into the sea , where all of them seem to decompose each other except the marine salt . Hence the ashes of peat contain little or no vegetable alcali and are not used in the countries , where peat constitutes the fuel of the lower people , for the purpose of washing linen . The second thing which is always seen oozing from morasses is iron in solution , which produces chalybeate springs , from whence depositions of ochre and variety of iron ores . The third elutriation seems to consist of vegetable acid , which by means unknown appears to be converted into all other acids . 1 . Into marine and nitrous acids as mentioned above . 2 . Into vitriolic acid which is found in some morasses so plentifully as to preserve the bodies of animals from putrefaction which have been buried in them , and this acid carried away by rain and dews and meeting with calcareous earth produces gypsum or alabaster , with clay it produces alum , and deprived of its vital air produces sulphur . 3 . Fluor acid which being washed away and meeting with calcareous earth produces fluor or cubic spar . 4 . The siliceous acid which seems to have been disseminated in great quantity either by solution in water or by solution in air , and appears to have produced the sand in the sea uniting with calcareous earth previously dissolved in that element , from which were afterwards formed some of the grit - stone rocks by means of a siliceous or calcareous cement . By its union with the calcareous earth of the morass other strata of siliceous sand have been produced ; and by the mixture of this with clay and lime arose the beds of marl .</p>
   <p>In other circumstances , probably where less moisture has prevailed , morasses seem to have undergone a fermentation , as other vegetable matter , new hay for instance is liable to do from the great quantity of sugar it contains . From the great heat thus produced in the lower parts of immense beds of morass the phlogistic part , or oil , or asphaltum , becomes distilled , and rising into higher strata becomes again condensed forming coal-beds of greater or less purity according to their greater or less quantity of inflammable matter ; at the same time the clay beds become purer or less so , as the phlogistic part is more or less completely exhaled from them . Though coal and clay are frequently produced in this manner , yet I have no doubt , but that they are likewise often produced by elutriation ; in situations on declivities the clay is washed away down into the valleys , and the phlogistic part or coal left behind ; this circumstance is seen in many valleys near the beds of rivers , which are covered recently by a whitish impure clay , called water-clay . See note XIX . XX . and XXIII .</p>
   <p>LORD CROMARTIE has furnished another curious observation on morasses in the paper above referred to . In a moss near the town of Eglin in Murray , though there is no river or water which communicates with the moss , yet for three or four feet of depth in the moss there are little shell-fish resembling oysters with living fish in them in great quantities , though no such fish are found in the adjacent rivers , nor even in the water pits in the moss , but only in the solid substance of the moss . This curious fact not only accounts for the shells sometimes found on the surface of coals , and in the clay above them ; but also for a thin stratum of shells which sometimes exists over iron-ore .</p>

   <p>As iron is formed near the surface of the earth , it becomes exposed to streams of water and of air more than most other metallic bodies , and thence becomes combined with oxygene , or vital air , and appears very frequently in its calciform state , as in variety of ochres . Manganese , and zinc , and sometimes lead , are also found near the surface of the earth , and on that account become combined with vital air and are exhibited in their calciform state .</p>
   <p>The avidity with which iron unites with oxygene , or vital air , in which process much heat is given out from the combining materials , is shewn by a curious experiment of M. Ingenhouz . A fine iron wire twisted spirally is fixed to a cork , on the point of the spire is fixed a match made of agaric dipped in solution of nitre ; the match is then ignited , and the wire with the cork put immediately into a bottle full of vital air , the match first burns vividly , and the iron soon takes fire and consumes with brilliant sparks till it is reduced to small brittle globules , gaining an addition of about one third of its weight by its union , with vital air . Annales de Chymie . Traité de Chimie , per Lavoisier , c. iii .</p>
   <p>STEEL .</p>
   <p>It is probably owing to a total deprivation of vital air which it holds with so great avidity , that iron on being kept many hours or days in ignited charcoal becomes converted into steel , and thence acquires the faculty of being welded when red hot long before it melts , and also the power of becoming hard when immersed in cold water ; both which I suppose depend on the same cause , that is , on its being a worse conductor of heat than other metals ; and hence the surface both acquires heat much sooner , and loses it much sooner , than the internal parts of it , in this circumstance resembling glass .</p>
   <p>When steel is made very hot , and suddenly immerged in very cold water , and moved about in it , the surface of the steel becomes cooled first , and thus producing a kind of case or arch over the internal part , prevents that internal part from contracting quite so much as it otherwise would do , whence it becomes brittler and harder , like the glass-drops called Prince Rupert 's drops , which are made by dropping melted glass into cold water . This idea is countenanced by the circumstance that hardened steel is specifically lighter than steel which is more gradually cooled . ( Nicholson 's Chemistry , p . 313 . ) Why the brittleness and hardness of steel or glass should keep pace or be companions to each other may be difficult to conceive .</p>
   <p>When a steel spring is forcibly bent till it break , it requires less power to bend it through the first inch than the second , and less through the second than the third ; the same I suppose to happen if a wire be distended till it break by hanging weights to it ; this shews that the particles may be forced from each other to a small distance by less power , than is necessary to make them recede to a greater distance ; in this circumstance perhaps the attraction of cohesion differs from that of gravitation , which exerts its power inversely as the squares of the distance . Hence it appears that if the innermost particles of a steel bar , by cooling the external surface first , are kept from approaching each other so nearly as they otherwise would do , that they become in the situation of the particles on the convex side of a bent spring , and can not be forced further from each other except by a greater power than would have been necessary to have made them recede thus far . And secondly , that if they be forced a little further from each other they separate ; this may be exemplified by laying two magnetic needles parallel to each other , the contrary poles together , then drawing them longitudinally from each other , they will slide with small force till they begin to separate , and will then require a stronger force to really separate them . Hence it appears , that hardness and brittleness depend on the same circumstance , that the particles are removed to a greater distance from each other and thus resist any power more forcibly which is applied to displace them further , this constitutes hardness . And secondly , if they are displaced by such applied force they immediately separate , and this constitutes brittleness .</p>
   <p>Steel may be thus rendered too brittle for many purposes , on which account artists have means of softening it again , by exposing it to certain degrees of heat , for the construction of different kinds of tools , which is called tempering it . Some artists plunge large tools in very cold water as soon as they are compleatly ignited , and moving it about , take it out as soon as it ceases to be luminous beneath the water ; it is then rubbed quickly with a file or on sand to clean the surface , the heat which the metal still retains soon begins to produce a succession of colours ; if a hard temper be required , the piece is dipped again and stirred about in cold water as soon as the yellow tinge appears , if it be cooled when the purple tinge appears it becomes fit for gravers ’ tools used in working upon metals ; if cooled while blue it is proper for springs . Nicholson 's Chemistry , p. 313 . Keir 's Chemical Dictionary .</p>
   <p>MODERN PRODUCTION OF IRON .</p>
   <p>The recent production of iron is evinced from the chalybeate waters which flow from morasses which lie upon gravel-beds , and which must therefore have produced iron after those gravel-beds were raised out of the sea . On the south side of the road between Cheadle and Okeymoor in Staffordshire , yellow stains of iron are seen to penetrate the gravel from a thin morass on its surface . There is a fissure eight or ten feet wide , in a gravel-bed on the eastern side of the hollow road ascending the hill about a mile from Trentham in Staffordshire , leading toward Drayton in Shropshire , which fissure is filled up with nodules of iron - ore. A bank of sods is now raised against this fissure to prevent the loose iron nodules from falling into the turnpike road , and thus this natural curiosity is at present concealed from travellers . A similar fissure in a bed of marl , and filled up with iron nodules and with some large pieces of flint , is seen on the eastern side of the hollow road ascending the hill from the turnpike house about a mile from Derby in the road towards Burton . And another such fissure filled with iron nodes , appears about half a mile from Newton-Solney in Derbyshire , in the road to Burton , near the summit of the hill . These collections of iron and of flint must have been produced posterior to the elevation of all those hills , and were thence evidently of vegetable or animal origin . To which should be added , that iron is found in general in beds either near the surface of the earth , or stratified with clay coals or argillaceous grit , which are themselves productions of the modern world , that is , from the recrements of vegetables and air-breathing animals .</p>
   <p>Not only iron but manganese , calamy , and even copper and lead appear in some instances to have been of recent production . Iron and manganese are detected in all vegetable productions , and it is probable other metallic bodies might be found to exist in vegetable or animal matters , if we had tests to detect them in very minute quantities . Manganese and calamy are found in beds like iron near the surface of the earth , and in a calciform state , which countenances their modern production . The recent production of calamy , one of the ores of zinc , appears from its frequently incrusting calcareous spar in its descent from the surface of the earth into the uppermost fissures of the limestone mountains of Derbyshire . That the calamy has been carried by its solution or diffusion in water into these cavities , and not by its ascent from below in form of steam , is evinced from its not only forming a crust over the dogtooth spar , but by its afterwards dissolving or destroying the sparry crystal . I have specimens of calamy in the form of dogtooth spar , two inches high , which are hollow , and stand half an inch above the diminished sparry crystal on which they were formed , like a sheath a great deal too big for it ; this seems to shew , that this process was carried on in water , otherwise after the calamy had incrusted its spar , and dissolved its surface , so as to form a hollow cavern over it , it could not act further upon it except by the interposition of some medium . As these spars and calamy are formed in the fissures of mountains they must both have been formed after the elevation of those mountains .</p>
   <p>In respect to the recent production of copper , it was before observed in note on Canto II . l. 394 , that the summit of the grit-stone mountain at Hawkstone in Shropshire , is tinged with copper , which from the appearance of the blue stains seems to have descended to the parts of the rock beneath . I have a calciform ore of copper consisting of the hollow crusts of cubic cells , which has evidently been formed on crystals of fluor , which it has eroded in the same manner as the calamy erodes the calcareous crystals , from whence may be deduced in the same manner , the aqueous solution or diffusion , as well as the recent production of this calciform ore of copper .</p>
   <p>Lead in small quantities is sometimes found in the fissures of coal - beds , which fissures are previously covered with spar ; and sometimes in nodules of iron-ore. Of the former I have a specimen from near Caulk in Derbyshire , and of the latter from Colebrook Dale in Shropshire . Though all these facts shew that some metallic bodies are formed from vegetable or animal recrements , as iron , and perhaps manganese and calamy , all which are found near the surface of the earth ; yet as the other metals are found only in fissures of rocks , which penetrate to unknown depths , they may be wholly or in part produced by ascending steams from subterraneous fires , as mentioned in note on Canto II . l. 398 .</p>
   <p>SEPTARIA OF IRON-STONE .</p>
   <p>Over some lime works at Walsall in Staffordshire , I observed some years ago a stratum of iron earth about six inches thick , full of very large cavities ; these cavities were evidently produced when the material passed from a semifluid state into a solid one ; as the frit of the potters , or a mixture of clay and water is liable to crack in drying ; which is owing to the further contraction of the internal part , after the crust is become hard . These hollows are liable to receive extraneous matter , as I believe gypsum , and sometimes spar , and even lead ; a curious specimen of the last was presented to me by Mr. Darby of Colebrook Dale , which contains in its cavity some ounces of lead-ore . But there are other septaria of iron-stone which seem to have had a very different origin , their cavities having been formed in cooling or congealing from an ignited state , as is ingeniously deduced by Dr. Hutton from their internal structure . Edinb . Transact . Vol . I. p. 246 . The volcanic origin of these curious septaria appears to me to be further evinced from their form and the places where they are found . They consist of oblate spheroids and are found in many parts of the earth totally detached from the beds in which they lie , as at East Lothian in Scotland . Two of these , which now lie before me , were found with many others immersed in argillaceous shale or shiver , surrounded by broken limestone mountains at Bradbourn near Ashbourn in Derbyshire , and were presented to me by Mr. Buxton , a gentleman of that town . One of these is about fifteen inches in its equatorial diameter , and about six inches in its polar one , and contains beautiful star-like septaria incrusted and in part filled with calcareous spar . The other is about eight inches in its equatorial diameter , and about four inches in its polar diameter , and is quite solid , but shews on its internal surface marks of different colours , as if a beginning separation had taken place . Now as these septaria contain fifty per cent , of iron , according to Dr. Hutton , they would soften or melt into a semifluid globule by subterraneous fire by less heat than the limestone in their vicinity ; and if they were ejected through a hole or fissure would gain a circular motion along with their progressive one by their greater friction or adhesion to one side of the hole . This whirling motion would produce the oblate spheroidical form which they possess , and which as far as I know can not in any other way be accounted for . They would then harden in the air as they rose into the colder parts of the atmosphere ; and as they descended into so soft a material as shale or shiver , their forms would not be injured in their fall ; and their presence in materials so different from themselves becomes accounted for .</p>
   <p>About the tropics of the large septarium above mentioned , are circular eminent lines , such as might have been left if it had been coarsely turned in a lathe . These lines seem to consist of a fluid matter , which seems to have exsuded in circular zones , as their edges appear blunted or retracted ; and the septarium seems to have split easier in such sections parallel to its equator . Now as the crust would first begin to cool and harden after its ejection in a semifluid state , and the equatorial diameter would become gradually enlarged as it rose in the air ; the internal parts being softer would slide beneath the polar crust , which might crack and permit part of the semifluid to exsude , and it is probable the adhesion would thus become less in sections parallel to the equator . Which further confirms this idea of the production of these curious septaria . A new-cast cannon ball red-hot with its crust only solid , if it were shot into the air would probably burst in its passage ; as it would consist of a more fluid material than these septaria ; and thus by discharging a shower of liquid iron would produce more dreadful combustion , if used in war , than could be effected by a ball , which had been cooled and was heated again : since in the latter case the ball could not have its internal parts made hotter than the crust of it , without first loosing its form .</p>

   <p>1 . SILICEOUS ROCKS .</p>
   <p>The great masses of siliceous sand which lie in rocks upon the beds of limestone , or which are stratified with clay , coal , and iron-ore , are evidently produced in the decomposition of vegetable or animal matters , as explained in the note on morasses . Hence the impressions of vegetable roots and even whole trees are often found in sand-stone , as well as in coals and iron-ore . In these sand-rocks both the siliceous acid and the calcareous base seem to be produced from the materials of the morass ; for though the presence of a siliceous acid and of a calcareous base have not yet been separately exhibited from flints , yet from the analogy of flint to fluor , and gypsum , and marble , and from the conversion of the latter into flint , there can be little doubt of their existence .</p>
   <p>These siliceous sand-rocks are either held together by a siliceous cement , or have a greater or less portion of clay in them , which in some acts as a cement to the siliceous crystals , but in others is in such great abundance that in burning them they become an imperfect porcelain and are then used to repair the roads , as at Chesterfield in Derbyshire ; these are called argillaceous grit by Mr. Kirwan . In other places a calcareous matter cements the crystals together ; and in other places the siliceous crystals lie in loose strata under the marl in the form of white sand ; as at Normington about a mile from Derby .</p>
   <p>The lowest beds of siliceous sand-stone produced from morasses seem to obtain their acid from the morass , and their calcareous base from the limestone on which it rests ; These beds possess a siliceous cement , and from their greater purity and hardness are used for course grinding - stones and scyth stones , and are situated on the edges of limestone countries , having lost the other strata of coals , or clay , or iron , which were originally produced above them . Such are the sand-rocks incumbent on limestone near Matlock in Derbyshire . As these siliceous sand-rocks contain no marine productions scattered amongst them , they appear to have been elevated , torn to pieces , and many fragments of them scattered over the adjacent country by explosions , from fires within the morass from which they have been formed ; and which dissipated every thing inflammable above and beneath them , except some stains of iron , with which they are in some places spotted . If these sand-rocks had been accumulated beneath the sea , and elevated along with the beds of limestone on which they rest , some vestiges of marine shells either in their siliceous or calcareous state must have been discerned amongst them .</p>
   <p>2 . SILICEOUS TREES .</p>
   <p>In many of these sand-rocks are found the impressions of vegetable roots , which seem to have been the most unchangeable parts of the plant , as shells and shark 's teeth are found in chalk-beds from their being the most unchangeable parts of the animal . In other instances the wood itself is penetrated , and whole trees converted into flint ; specimens of which I have by me , from near Coventry , and from a gravel-pit in Shropshire near Child 's Archal in the road to Drayton . Other polished specimens of vegetable flints abound in the cabinets of the curious , which evidently shew the concentric circles of woody fibres , and their interstices filled with whiter siliceous matter , with the branching off of the knots when cut horizontally , and the parallel lines of wood when cut longitudinally , with uncommon beauty and variety . Of these I possess some beautiful specimens , which were presented to me by the Earl of Uxbridge .</p>
   <p>The colours of these siliceous vegetables are generally brown , from the iron , I suppose , or manganese , which induced them to crystallize or to fuse more easily . Some of the cracks of the wood in drying are filled with white flint or calcedony , and others of them remain hollow , lined with innumerable small crystals tinged with iron , which I suppose had a share in converting their calcareous matter into siliceous crystals , because the crystals called Peak-diamonds are always found bedded in an ochreous earth ; and those called Bristol-stones are situated on limestone coloured with iron . Mr. F. French presented me with a congeries of siliceous crystals , which he gathered on the crater ( as he supposes ) of an extinguished volcano at Cromach Water in Cumberland . The crystals are about an inch high in the shape of dogtooth or calcareous spar , covered with a dark ferruginous matter . The bed on which they rest is about an inch in thickness , and is stained with iron on its undersurface . This curious fossil shews the transmutation of calcareous earth into siliceous , as much as the siliceous shells which abound in the cabinets of the curious . There may sometime be discovered in this age of science , a method of thus impregnating wood with liquid flint , which would produce pillars for the support , and tiles for the covering of houses , which would be uninflammable and endure as long as the earth beneath them .</p>
   <p>That some siliceous productions have been in a fluid state without much heat at the time of their formation appears from the vegetable flints above described not having quite lost their organized appearance ; from shells , and coralloids , and entrochi being converted into flint without loosing their form ; from the bason of calcedony round Giesar in Iceland ; and from the experiment of Mr. Bergman , who obtained thirteen regular formed crystals by suffering the powder of quartz to remain in a vessel with fluor acid for two years ; these crystals were about the size of small peas , and were not so hard as quartz . Opusc . de Terrâ Siliceâ , p. 33 . Mr. Achard procured both calcareous and siliceous crystals , one from calcareous earth , and the other from the earth of alum , both dissolved in water impregnated with fixed air ; the water filtrating very slowly through a porous bottom of baked clay . See Journal de Physique , for January , 1778 .</p>
   <p>3 . AGATES , ONYXES , SCOTS-PEBBLES .</p>
   <p>In small cavities of these sand-rocks , I am informed , the beautiful siliceous nodules are found which are called Scot'shYpppHeNpebbles ; and which on being cut in different directions take the names of agates , onyxes , sardonyxes , &amp; c. according to the colours of the lines or strata which they exhibit . Some of the nodules are hollow and filled with crystals , others have a nucleus of less compact siliceous matter which is generally white , surrounded with many concentric strata coloured with iron , and other alternate strata of white agate or calcedony , sometimes to the number of thirty .</p>
   <p>I think these nodules bear evident marks of their having been in perfect fusion by either heat alone , or by water and heat , under great pressure , according to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton ; but I do not imagine , that they were injected into cavities from materials from without , but that some vegetables or parts of vegetables containing more iron or manganese than others , facilitated the compleat fusion , thus destroying the vestiges of vegetable organization , which were conspicuous in the siliceous trees above mentioned . Some of these nodules being hollow and lined with crystals , and others containing a nucleus of white siliceous matter of a looser texture , shew they were composed of the materials then existing in the cavity ; which consisting before of loose sand , must take up less space when fused into a solid mass .</p>
   <p>These siliceous nodules resemble the nodules of iron-stone mentioned in note on Canto II . l. 183 , in respect to their possessing a great number of concentric spheres coloured generally with iron , but they differ in this circumstance , that the concentric spheres generally obey the form of the external crust , and in their not possessing a chalybeate nucleus . The stalactites formed on the roofs of caverns are often coloured in concentric strata , by their coats being spread over each other at different times ; and some of them , as the cupreous ones , possess great beauty from this formation ; but as these are necessarily more or less of a cylindrical or conic form , the nodules or globular flints above described cannot have been constructed in this manner . To what law of nature then is to be referred the production of such numerous concentric spheres ? I suspect to the law of congelation .</p>
   <p>When salt and water are exposed to severe frosty air , the salt is said to be precipitated as the water freezes ; that is , as the heat , in which it was dissolved , is withdrawn ; where the experiment is tried in a bowl or bason , this may be true , as the surface freezes first , and the salt is found at the bottom . But in a fluid exposed in a thin phial , I found by experiment , that the extraneous matter previously dissolved by the heat in the mixture was not simply set at liberty to subside , but was detruded or pushed backward as the ice was produced . The experiment was this : about two ounces of a solution of blue vitriol were accidentally frozen in a thin phial , the glass was cracked and fallen to pieces , the ice was dissolved , and I found a pillar of blue vitriol standing erect on the bottom of the broken bottle . Nor is this power of congelation more extraordinary , than that by its powerful and sudden expansion it should burst iron shells and coehorns , or throw out the plugs with which the water was secured in them above one hundred and thirty yards , according to the experiments at Quebec by Major Williams . Edinb . Transact . Vol . II . p. 23 .</p>
   <p>In some siliceous nodules which now lie before me , the external crust for about the tenth of an inch consists of white agate , in others it is much thinner , and in some much thicker ; corresponding with this crust there are from twenty to thirty superincumbent strata , of alternately darker and lighter colour ; whence it appears , that the external crust as it cooled or froze , propelled from it the iron or manganese which was dissolved in it ; this receded till it had formed an arch or vault strong enough to resist its further protrusion ; then the next inner sphere or stratum as it cooled or froze , propelled forwards its colouring matter in the same manner , till another arch or sphere produced sufficient resistance to this frigoriscent expulsion . Some of them have detruded their colouring matter quite to the centre , the rings continuing to become darker as they are nearer it ; in others the chalybeate arch seems to have stopped half an inch from the centre , and become thicker by having attracted to itself the irony matter from the white nucleus , owing probably to its cooling less precipitately in the central parts than at the surface of the pebble .</p>
   <p>A similar detrusion of a marly matter in circular arches or vaults obtains in the salt mines in Cheshire ; from whence Dr. Hutton very ingeniously concludes , that the salt must have been liquified by heat ; which would seem to be much confirmed by the above theory . Edinb . Transact . Vol . I. p. 244 .</p>
   <p>I cannot conclude this account of Scots-pebbles without observing that some of them on being sawed longitudinally asunder , seem still to possess some vestiges of the cylindrical organization of vegetables ; others possess a nucleus of white agate much resembling some bulbous roots with their concentric coats , or the knots in elm-roots or crab - trees ; some of these I suppose were formed in the manner above explained , during the congelation of masses of melted flint and iron ; others may have been formed from a vegetable nucleus , and retain some vestiges of the organization of the plant .</p>
   <p>4 . SAND OF THE SEA .</p>
   <p>The great abundance of siliceous sand at the bottom of the ocean may in part be washed down from the siliceous rocks above described , but in general I suppose it derives its acid only from the vegetable and animal matter of morasses , which is carried down by floods or by the atmosphere , and becomes united in the sea with its calcareous base from shells and coralloids , and thus assumes its crystalline form at the bottom of the ocean , and is there intermixed with gravel or other matters washed from the mountains in its vicinity .</p>
   <p>5 . CHERT , OR PETROSILEX .</p>
   <p>The rocks of marble are often alternately intermixed with strata of chert , or coarse flint , and this in beds from one to three feet thick , as at Ham and Matlock , or of less than the tenth of an inch in thickness , as a mile or two from Bakewell in the road to Buxton . It is difficult to conceive in what manner ten or twenty strata of either limestone or flint , of different shades of white and black , could be laid quite regularly over each other from sediments or precipitations from the sea ; it appears to me much easier to comprehend , by supposing with Dr. Hutton , that both the solid rocks of marble and the flint had been fused by great heat , ( or by heat and water ,) under immense pressure ; by its cooling or congealing the colouring matter might be detruded , and form parallel or curvilinean strata , as above explained .</p>
   <p>The colouring matter both of limestone and flint was probably owing to the flesh of peculiar animals , as well as the siliceous acid , which converted some of the limestone into flint ; or to some strata of shell - fish having been overwhelmed when alive with new materials , while others dying in their natural situations would lose their fleshy parts , either by its putrid solution in the water or by its being eaten by other sea - insects . I have some calcareous fossil shells which contain a black coaly matter in them , which was evidently the body of the animal , and others of the same kind filled with spar instead of it . The Labradore stone has I suppose its colours from the nacre or mother-pearl shells , from which it was probably produced . And there is a stratum of calcareous matter about six or eight inches thick at Wingerworth in Derbyshire over the iron-beds , which is replete with shells of fresh - water muscles , and evidently obtains its dark colour from them , as mentioned in note XVI . Many nodules of flint resemble in colour as well as in form the shell of the echinus or sea-urchin ; others resemble some coralloids both in form and colour ; and M. Arduini found in the Monte de Pancrasio , red flints branching like corals , from whence they seem to have obtained both their form and their colour . Ferber 's Travels in Italy , p. 42 .</p>
   <p>6 . NODULES OF FLINT IN CHALK-BEDS .</p>
   <p>As the nodules of flint found in chalk-beds possess no marks of having been rounded by attrition or solution , I conclude that they have gained their form as well as their dark colour from the flesh of the shell-fish from which they had their origin ; but which have been so compleatly fused by heat , or heat and water , as to obliterate all vestiges of the shell , in the same manner as the nodules of agate and onyx were produced from parts of vegetables , but which had been so completely fused as to obliterate all marks of their organization , or as many iron-nodules have obtained their form and origin from peculiar vegetables .</p>
   <p>Some nodules in chalk-beds consist of shells of echini filled up with chalk , the animal having been dissolved away by putrescence in water , or eaten by other sea-insects ; other shells of echini , in which I suppose the animal 's body remained , are converted into flint but still retain the form of the shell . Others , I suppose as above , being more completely fused , have become flint coloured by the animal flesh , but without the exact form either of the flesh or shell of the animal . Many of these are hollow within and lined with crystals , like the Scot'shYpppHeNpebbles above described ; but as the colouring matter of animal bodies differs but little from each other compared with those of vegetables , these flints vary less in their colours than those above mentioned . At the same time as they cooled in concentric spheres like the Scot'shYpppHeNpebbles , they often possess faint rings of colours , and always break in conchoide forms like them .</p>
   <p>This idea of the production of nodules of flint in chalk-beds is countenanced from the iron which generally appears as these flints become decomposed by the air ; which by uniting with the iron in their composition reduces it from a vitrescent state to that of calx , and thus renders it visible . And secondly , by there being no appearance in chalk - beds of a string or pipe of siliceous matter connecting one nodule with another , which must have happened if the siliceous matter , or its acid , had been injected from without according to the idea of Dr. Hutton . And thirdly , because many of them have very large cavities at their centres , which should not have happened had they been formed by the injection of a material from without .</p>
   <p>When shells or chalk are thus converted from calcareous to siliceous matter by the flesh of the animal , the new flint being heavier than the shell or chalk occupies less space than the materials it was produced from ; this is the cause of frequent cavities within them , where the whole mass has not been completely fused and pressed together . In Derbyshire there are masses of coralloid and other shells which have become siliceous , and are thus left with large vacuities sometimes within and sometimes on the outside of the remaining form of the shell , like the French millstones , and I suppose might serve the same purpose ; the gravel of the Derwent is full of specimens of this kind .</p>
   <p>Since writing the above I have received a very ingenious account of chalk-beds from Dr. MENISH of Chelmsford . He distinguishes chalk-beds into three kinds ; such as have been raised from the sea with little disturbance of their strata , as the cliffs of Dover and Margate , which he terms intire chalk . Another state of chalk is where it has suffered much derangement , as the banks of the Thames at Gravesend and Dartford . And a third state where fragments of chalk have been rounded by water , which he terms alluvial chalk . In the first of these situations of chalk he observes , that the flint lies in strata horizontally , generally in distinct nodules , but that he has observed two instances of solid plates or strata of flint , from an inch to two inches in thickness , interposed between the chalk-beds ; one of these is in a chalk-bank by the road side at Berkhamstead , the other in a bank on the road from Chatham leading to Canterbury . Dr. Menish has further observed , that many of the echini are crushed in their form , and yet filled with flint , which has taken the form of the crushed shell , and that though many flint nodules are hollow , yet that in some echini the siliceum seems to have enlarged , as it passed from a fluid to a solid state , as it swells out in a protuberance at the mouth and anus of the shell , and that though these shells are so filled with flint yet that in many places the shell itself remains calcareous . These strata of nodules and plates of flint seem to countenance their origin from the flesh of a stratum of animals which perished by some natural violence , and were buried in their shells .</p>
   <p>7 . ANGLES OF SILICEOUS SAND .</p>
   <p>In many rocks of siliceous sand the particles retain their angular form , and in some beds of loose sand , of which there is one of considerable purity a few yards beneath the marl at Normington about a mile south of Derby . Other siliceous sands have had their angles rounded off , like the pebbles in gravel-beds . These seem to owe their globular form to two causes ; one to their attrition against each other , when they may for centuries have lain at the bottom of the sea , or of rivers ; where they may have been progressively accumulated , and thus progressively at the same time rubbed upon each other by the dashing of the water , and where they would be more easily rolled over each other by their gravity being so much less than in air . This is evidently now going on in the river Derwent , for though there are no limestone rocks for ten or fifteen miles above Derby , yet a great part of the river-gravel at Derby consists of limestone nodules , whose angles are quite worn off in their descent down the stream .</p>
   <p>There is however another cause which must have contributed to round the angles both of calcareous and siliceous fragments ; and that is , their solubility in water ; calcareous earth is perpetually found suspended in the waters which pass over it ; and the earth of flints was observed by Bergman to be contained in water in the proportion of one grain to a gallon . Kirwan 's Mineralogy , p. 107 . In boiling water , however , it is soluble in much greater proportion , as appears from the siliceous earth sublimed in the distillation of fluor acid in glass vessels ; and from the basons of calcedony which surrounded the jets of hot water near mount Heccla in Iceland . Troil on Iceland . It is probable most siliceous sands or pebbles have at some ages of the world been long exposed to aqueous steams raised by subterranean fires . And if fragments of stone were long immersed in a fluid menstrum , their angular parts would be first dissolved , on account of their greater surface .</p>
   <p>Many beds of siliceous gravel are cemented together by a siliceous cement , and are called breccia ; as the plumb-pudding stones of Hartfordshire , and the walls of a subterraneous temple excavated by Mr. Curzon , at Hagley near Rugely in Staffordfshire ; these may have been exposed to great heat as they were immersed in water ; which water under great pressure of superincumbent materials may have been rendered red - hot , as in Papin 's digester ; and have thus possessed powers of solution with which we are unacquainted .</p>
   <p>8 . BASALTES AND GRANITES .</p>
   <p>Another source of siliceous stones is from the granite , or basaltes , or porphyries , which are of different hardnesses according to the materials of their composition , or to the fire they have undergone ; such are the stones of Arthur'shYpppHeNhill near Edinburgh , of the Giant 's Causway in Ireland , and of Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire ; the uppermost stratum of which last seems to have been cracked either by its elevation , or by its hastily cooling after ignition by the contact of dews or snows , and thus breaks into angular fragments , such as the streets of London are paved with ; or have had their angles rounded by attrition or by partial solution ; and have thus formed the common paving stones or bowlers ; as well as the gravel , which is often rolled into strata amid the siliceous sand-beds , which are either formed or collected in the sea .</p>
   <p>In what manner such a mass of crystallized matter as the Giant 's Causway and similar columns of basaltes , could have been raised without other volcanic appearances , may be a matter not easy to comprehend ; but there is another power in nature besides that of expansile vapour which may have raised some materials which have previously been in igneous or aqueous solution ; and that is the act of congelation . When the water in the experiments above related of Major Williams had by congelation thrown out the plugs from the bomb-shells , a column of ice rose from the hole of the bomb six or eight inches high . Other bodies I suspect increase in bulk which crystallize in cooling , as iron and type-metal . I remember pouring eight or ten pounds of melted brimstone into a pot to cool and was surprized to see after a little time a part of the fluid beneath break a hole in the congealed crust above it , and gradually rise into a promontory several inches high ; the basaltes has many marks of fusion and of crystallization and may thence , as well as many other kinds of rocks , as of spar , marble , petrosilex , jasper , &amp; c. have been raised by the power of congelation , a power whose quantity has not yet been ascertained , and perhaps greater and more universal than that of vapours expanded by heat . These basaltic columns rise sometimes out of mountains of granite itself , as mentioned by Dr. Beddoes , ( Phil . Transact . Vol . LXXX . ) and as they seem to consist of similar materials more completely fused , there is still greater reason to believe them to have been elevated in the cooling or crystallization of the mass .

   </lg>
   <p>The philosophers , who have attended to the formation of the earth , have acknowledged two great agents in producing the various changes which the terraqueous globe has undergone , and these are water and fire . Some of them have perhaps ascribed too much to one of these great agents of nature , and some to the other . They have generally agreed that the stratification of materials could only be produced from sediments or precipitations , which were previously mixed or dissolved in the sea ; and that whatever effects were produced by fire were performed afterwards .</p>
   <p>There is however great difficulty in accounting for the universal stratification of the solid globe of the earth in this manner , since many of the materials , which appear in strata , could not have been suspended in water ; as the nodules of flint in chalk-beds , the extensive beds of shells , and lastly the strata of coal , clay , sand , and iron-ore , which in most coal-countries lie from five to seven times alternately stratified over each other , and none of them are soluble in water . Add to this if a solution of them or a mixture of them in water could be supposed , the cause of that solution must cease before a precipitation could commence .</p>
   <p>1 . The great masses of lava , under the various names of granite , porphyry , toadstone , moor-stone , rag , and slate , which constitute the old world , may have acquired the stratification , which some of them appear to possess , by their having been formed by successive eruptions of a fluid mass , which at different periods of antient time arose from volcanic shafts and covered each other , the surface of the interior mass of lava would cool and become solid before the superincumbent stratum was poured over it ; to the same cause may be ascribed their different compositions and textures , which are scarcely the same in any two parts of the world .</p>
   <p>2 . The stratifications of the great masses of limestone , which were produced from sea-shells , seem to have been formed by the different times at which the innumerable shells were produced and deposited . A colony of echini , or madrepores , or cornua ammonis , lived and perished in one period of time ; in another a new colony of either similar or different shells lived and died over the former ones , producing a stratum of more recent shell over a stratum of others which had began to petrify or to become marble ; and thus from unknown depths to what are now the summits of mountains the limestone is disposed in strata of varying solidity and colour . These have afterwards undergone variety of changes by their solution and deposition from the water in which they were immersed , or from having been exposed to great heat under great pressure , according to the ingenious theory of Dr. Hutton . Edinb . Transact . Vol . I . See Note XVI .</p>
   <p>3 . In most of the coal-countries of this island there are from five to seven beds of coal stratified with an equal number of beds , though of much greater thickness , of clay and sandstone , and occasionally of iron - ores . In what manner to account for the stratification of these materials seems to be a problem of greater difficulty . Philosophers have generally supposed that they have been arranged by the currents of the sea ; but considering their insolubility in water , and their almost similar specific gravity , an accumulation of them in such distinct beds from this cause is altogether inconceiveable , though some coal-countries bear marks of having been at some time immersed beneath the waves and raised again by subterranean fires .</p>
   <p>The higher and lower parts of morasses were necessarily produced at different periods of time , see Note XVII . and would thus originally be formed in strata of different ages . For when an old wood perished , and produced a morass , many centuries would elapse before another wood could grow and perish again upon the same ground , which would thus produce a new stratum of morass over the other , differing indeed principally in its age , and perhaps , as the timber might be different , in the proportions of its component parts .</p>
   <p>Now if we suppose the lowermost stratum of a morass become ignited , like fermenting hay , ( after whatever could be carried away by solution in water was gone ,) what would happen ? Certainly the inflammable part , the oil , sulphur , or bitumen , would burn away , and be evaporated in air ; and the fixed parts would be left , as clay , lime , and iron ; while some of the calcareous earth would join with the siliceous acid , and produce sand , or with the argillaceous earth , and produce marl . Thence after many centuries another bed would take fire , but with less degree of ignition , and with a greater body of morass over it , what then would happen ? The bitumen and sulphur would rise and might become condensed under an impervious stratum , which might not be ignited , and there form coal of different purities according to its degree of fluidity , which would permit some of the clay to subside through it into the place from which it was sublimed .</p>
   <p>Some centuries afterwards another similar process might take place , and either thicken the coal-bed , or produce a new clay-bed , or marl , or sand , or deposit iron upon it , according to the concomitant circumstances above mentioned .</p>
   <p>I do not mean to contend that a few masses of some materials may not have been rolled together by currents , when the mountains were much more elevated than at present , and in consequence the rivers broader and more rapid , and the storms of rain and wind greater both in quantity and force . Some gravel-beds may have been thus washed from the mountains ; and some white clay washed from morasses into valleys beneath them ; and some ochres of iron dissolved and again deposited by water ; and some calcareous depositions from water , ( as the bank for instance on which stand the houses at Matlock-bath ;) but these are of small extent or consequence compared to the primitive rocks of granite or porpyhry which form the nucleus of the earth , or to the immense strata of limestone which crust over the greatest part of this granite or porphyry ; or lastly to the very extensive beds of clay , marl , sandstone , coal , and iron , which were probably for many millions of years the only parts of our continents and islands , which were then elevated above the level of the sea , and which on that account became covered with vegetation , and thence acquired their later or superincumbent strata , which constitute , what some have termed , the new world .</p>
   <p>There is another source of clay , and that of the finest kind , from decomposed granite , this is of a snowy white and mixed with mining particles of mica , of this kind is an earth from the country of Cherokees . Other kinds are from less pure lavas ; Mr. Ferber asserts that the sulphurous steams from Mount Vesuvius convert the lava into clay .</p>
   <p>“ The lavas of the antient Solfatara volcano have been undoubtedly of a vitreous nature , and these appear at present argillaceous . Some fragments of this lava are but half or at one side changed into clay , which either is viscid or ductile , or hard and stoney . Clays by fire are deprived of their coherent quality , which cannot be restored to them by pulverization , nor by humectation . But the sulphureous Solfatara steams restore it , as may be easily observed on the broken pots wherein they gather the sal ammoniac ; though very well baked and burnt at Naples they are mollified again by the acid steams into a viscid clay which keeps the former fire-burnt colour . ” Travels in Italy , p. 156 .</p>

   <p>The fine bright purples or rose colours which we see on china cups are not producible with any other material except gold , manganese indeed gives a purple but of a very different kind .</p>
   <p>In Europe the application of gold to these purposes appears to be of modern invention . Cassius 's discovery of the precipitate of gold by tin , and the use of that precipitate for colouring glass and enamels , are now generally known , but though the precipitate with tin be more successful in producing the ruby glass , or the colourless glass which becomes red by subsequent ignition , the tin probably contributing to prevent the gold from separating , ( which it is very liable to do during the fusion ; yet , for enamels , the precipitates made by alcaline salts answer equally well , and give a finer red , the colour produced by the tin precipitate being a bluish purple , but with the others a rose red . I am informed that some of our best artists prefer aurum fulminans , mixing it , before it has become dry , with the white composition or enamel flux ; when once it is divided by the other matter , it is ground with great safety , and without the least danger of explosion , whether moist or dry . The colour is remarkably improved and brought forth by long grinding , which accordingly makes an essential circumstance in the process .</p>
   <p>The precipitates of gold , and the colcothar or other red preparations of iron , are called tender colours . The heat must be no greater than is just sufficient to make the enamel run upon the piece , for if greater , the colours will be destroyed or changed to a different kind . When the vitreous matter has just become fluid it seems as if the coloured metallic calx remained barely intermixed with it , like a coloured powder of exquisite tenuity suspended in water : but by stronger fire the calx is dissolved , and metallic colours are altered by solution in glass as well as in acids or alcalies .</p>
   <p>The Saxon mines have till very lately almost exclusively supplied the rest of Europe with cobalt , or rather with its preparations , zaffre and smalt , for the exportation of the ore itself is there a capital crime . Hungary , Spain , Sweden , and some other parts of the continent , are now said to afford cobalts equal to the Saxon , and specimens have been discovered in our own island , both in Cornwall and in Scotland ; but hitherto in no great quantity .</p>
   <p>Calces of cobalt and of copper differ very materially from those above mentioned in their application for colouring enamels . In those the calx has previously acquired the intended colour , a colour which bears a red heat without injury , and all that remains is to fix it on the piece by a vitreous flux . But the blue colour of cobalt , and the green or bluish green of copper , are produced by vitrification , that is , by solution in the glass , and a strong fire is necessary for their perfection . These calces therefore , when mixed with the enamel flux , are melted in crucibles , once or oftener , and the deep coloured opake glass , thence resulting , is ground into unpalpable powder , and used for enamel . One part of either of these calces is put to ten , sixteen , or twenty parts of the flux , according to the depth of colour required . The heat of the enamel kiln is only a full red , such as is marked on Mr. Wedgwood 's thermometer 6 degrees . It is therefore necessary that the flux be so adjusted as to melt in that low heat . The usual materials are flint , or flint-glass , with a due proportion of red-led , or borax , or both , and sometimes a little tin calx to give opacity .</p>
   <p>Ka-o-lin is the name given by the Chinese to their porcelain clay , and pe-tun-tse to the other ingredient in their China ware . Specimens of both these have been brought into England , and found to agree in quality with some of our own materials . Kaolin is the very same with the clay</p>
