    <head>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION .</head>
    <p n="1">BY CHARLES FOLLEN .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="dedication">
    <p>This little book is dedicated to parents and children . Most of the poems were written with no other hope , than that they would instruct or please some child . The pleasure they have given in a limited circle has tempted the writer to print them . Some have never before appeared in public , but most of them have been already published in different works ; some few , without the author 's knowledge . It will be found that these poems are intended for children of different ages and characters . It may be objected to the book , that gay and serious pieces are bound up together ; but so it is in human life and human nature , and it is essential to the healthful action of a child 's mind that it should be so . The smile that overtakes its tears is as necessary to the child as the sun after a spring shower is to the young plant ; and without it a blight will fall upon the opening blossom . The natural love that all have for their literary offspring , perhaps , first induced the author to bring the stray little family together . This motive was strengthened by the hope that children might love the book , and that she might have the pleasure of seeing it among their treasures , with the corners of the leaves well worn by their little fingers , and perhaps sometimes placed upon the pillow where “ angels hover round . ” This success , which must secure to her also the approbation of parents , she does aspire after , and most earnestly desire ; this , and this alone , will satisfy her ; without this , she would be the first to pronounce it an unworthy offering .</p>

    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="2">TO THE PRESENT EDITION .</p>
    <p n="3">The present edition of Hymns , Songs , and Fables , has been greatly enlarged , by poems either not before printed , or that have had a very limited circulation , and also by a number of translations from the German . If they should have the good fortune to add to the innocent pleasure of the young , and deserve to become associated in their minds with the pure and hallowed recollections of home , and happy early days , my highest ambition with regard to them be entirely gratified .</p>

     <l n="79">You both are wrong , and both are right ,</l>
     <l n="80">And both are very impolite .</l>

     <l n="82">To talk of every thing that 's true .</l>
     <l n="83">All personal remarks avoid ,</l>

     <l n="85">At hearing disagreeable truth ;</l>
     <l n="86">Besides , it shows you quite uncouth ,</l>

     <l n="89">Think , Pins and Needles , while you may ,</l>

     <l n="100">Ye Needles in your cases muse !</l>
     <l n="101">And take me for your kind adviser ,</l>
     <l n="102">And only think of growing wiser ;</l>

     <l n="104">Something you 'll have to talk about ,</l>
     <l n="105">And need not get into a passion ,</l>
     <l n="106">And quarrel in this vulgar fashion .</l>
     <l n="107">Less of yourselves you 'll think , and more</l>
     <l n="108">Of others , than you did before .</l>
     <l n="109">You 'll learn , that in their own right sphere</l>
     <l n="110">All things with dignity appear .</l>

    <head>BILLY RABBIT TO MARY .</head>
    <note>Billy Rabbit was a little rabbit which a boy caught in the woods , and gave to a little girl of the name of Mary . She was very attentive to the little prisoner , gave him an abundance of good things to eat , and tried her best to make him happy ; but all in vain . After many attempts , he at last succeeded in making his escape , and instantly disappeared in the woods . In the course of the day , the following letter , sealed with a sharp thorn , was received by his friend Mary .</note>

     <l n="2">You thought , my dear Mary , you had Billy fast ,</l>
     <l n="3">But I tried very hard , and escaped you at last ;</l>
     <l n="4">The chance was so tempting , I thought I would nab it ,—</l>
     <l n="5">It was not very naughty , I 'm sure , in a rabbit .</l>
     <l n="6">O , let not your kind heart be angry with me ;</l>
     <l n="7">But think what a joy it is to be free ,</l>
     <l n="8">To see the green woods , to feel the fresh air ,</l>
     <l n="9">To skip , and to play , and to run everywhere .</l>
     <l n="10">The food that you gave me was pleasant and sweet ,</l>

    <head>THE OLD AND NEW SHOES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Good bye , get away , you ugly old things ! ”</l>
     <l n="2">Said a little boy once to his shoes ;</l>
     <l n="3">“ All stubbed are your toes , all twisted your strings ,</l>
     <l n="4">You 're wrinkled , one-sided , and loose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ But here are my new ones , so shiny and bright ,</l>
     <l n="6">They are almost as smooth as my skin ;</l>
     <l n="7">How stiff they are , too ! how straight and upright !</l>
     <l n="8">How snug my feet feel now they 're in ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">So saying , he gave to his old shoes a kick ,</l>
     <l n="10">And strutted with pride to the door ;</l>
     <l n="11">His unkindness had cut the old shoes to the quick ,</l>
     <l n="12">For nothing contempt can endure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ Master Frank , Master Frank , stop a while , if you please , ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Frank stood still with wonder and looked at the shoe ,</l>
     <l n="18">But could not see into the matter ;</l>
     <l n="19">At last he exclaimed ,— “ As they 've nothing to do ,</l>
     <l n="20">I suppose , like Poll Parrot , they chatter . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">So he opened the door , and walked down the stairs ;</l>
     <l n="22">His shoes were too stiff to go fast ;</l>
     <l n="23">But let us observe him , and see how he fares ,</l>
     <l n="24">How repentant poor Frank was at last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">His shoes were so smooth that he could but just stand ,</l>

     <l n="28">And remember he had on new shoes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">But Fido ran in , who loved little Frank ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the shoes were remembered no more ;</l>
     <l n="31">They began to cut capers , but at the first prank</l>
     <l n="32">Down tumbled poor Frank on the floor .</l>

     <l n="33">He was a brave boy , he thought not of crying ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="37">He went to his bed with his heart full of sorrow ;</l>
     <l n="38">He said to the nurse ,— “ I should choose ,</l>

     <l n="40">To put on my easy old shoes .</l>

     <l n="41">“ See how red my toes are , and I 'm all black and blue ;</l>
     <l n="42">I do n't like my new shoes at all . ”</l>
     <l n="43">“ Ah ! you see , ” answered Betsey , “ what I told you was true ;</l>
     <l n="44">Your shoes , Master Frank , are too small . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="45">His old shoes he was glad in the morning to see ,</l>
     <l n="46">And , forgetting his trouble and pain ,</l>
     <l n="47">“ How happy , ” said he , “ my poor toes will be</l>
     <l n="48">To get into the old shoes again . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="49">The voice of the old shoe now once more was heard :—</l>
     <l n="50">“ Master Frank , will you please to attend ?</l>
     <l n="51">I wish , with your leave , to say just a word ,—</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Tis a word of advice from a friend .</l>

     <l n="59">I have done , ” said the shoe , in a kind , easy tone ,</l>
     <l n="60">And it gaped as the lecture was ended .</l>

     <l n="61">New toes and new heels now the old shoes have got ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The monkeys , ‘ tis said , once asked of the bears ,</l>

     <l n="4">By which the young bears were kept hearty and well .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Perhaps it may be , ” said one of the mothers ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who seemed more considerate and wise than the others ,</l>
     <l n="7">“ Perhaps , ” said she , trembling at even the thought ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ We give our dear young ones less food than we ought ;</l>
     <l n="9">We may be impatient ; I have really some fears</l>
     <l n="10">That we rock them too little , the poor little dears ;</l>
     <l n="11">Our milk may cause fever , and their stomachs not suit ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or perhaps they are weakened and injured by fruit .</l>
     <l n="13">Perhaps the whole mischief is caused by the air ,</l>
     <l n="14">And who ‘ gainst this evil can ever prepare ?</l>
     <l n="15">In their earliest years , it may poison instil ,</l>
     <l n="16">And through their whole lifetime produce every ill .</l>
     <l n="17">Perhaps it may be , before we are aware ,</l>
     <l n="18">They breathe in a pestilence , borne on the air .</l>
     <l n="19">Perhaps , for the nerves of us monkeys are weak ,</l>
     <l n="20">In jumping , or leaping , some bone they may break</l>
     <l n="21">In their breasts . ” Here , for weeping , she scarcely could speak ,</l>
     <l n="22">And she snatched up her little one long to her breast ;</l>
     <l n="23">With such vehement love the poor victim she pressed ,</l>
     <l n="24">That all its complainings and troubles were stilled ;</l>
     <l n="25">Alas the poor mother ! her pet she had killed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="26">Said the bear ,— “ No longer I think you need seek</l>
     <l n="27">For the cause why your young ones are sickly and weak ;</l>
     <l n="28">It is not the milk , nor the fruit , nor the air ,</l>
     <l n="29">Nor fault of the stomach , and ‘ tis no lack of care .</l>
     <l n="30">Your blind fondness it is that cuts short their days .</l>
     <l n="31">How is it that we such multitudes raise ?</l>
     <l n="32">As soon as our young ones are able to run ,</l>
     <l n="33">We take them out with us to play in the sun .</l>
     <l n="34">We take them through floods , through heat , and through cold ,</l>
     <l n="35">And so they are healthy , and live to be old . ”</l>

Part Third ,— The Ministry and Literature ; Religion and Philosophy ; Social Reforms ; The Antislavery Movement ; Politics ; Friends ; Home Life ; Notes . NOTICES OF THE PRESS . “ A more interesting and instructive biographical work we have never read . High as was our opinion of Channing ,— of his intellectual and moral worth ,— the perusal of this work has convinced us that we never duly estimated him .... His letters reveal his character more fully than his sermons and essays . In his letters he lays his heart entirely open ; and no man , no matter what his opinions or prejudices , can read them without saying ,— ‘ Channing was , indeed , a great and good man ,— one who lived for the world ! ’ ” — Christian Messenger . “ Only one who was similar in purpose and temper ,— who felt like aspirations , hopes , and faith ,— could at all do justice to the distinguished subject . The present book must , therefore , we are sure , give us Channing 's character in its completeness , and true harmony and proportions of parts . ” — Salem Observer . “ These memoirs of a great and good man will , we apprehend , obtain an uncommonly extensive circulation , not only among the denomination of Christians in which he ranked himself , but with all who reverence purity of character , an enlarged philanthropy , and eminent talents , guided by virtue and piety . ” — Salem Register . “ If we mistake not , now is the very time in God 's providence when the biography of William Ellery Channing could best make its appearance . We have heard that a distinguished divine , of different speculative religious views from Dr. Channing , has recently said ,— ‘ Channing is greatly needed among us at this present moment . ’ Behold him here ! We doubt not that the biography thus prepared is to make a great impression on the age that is passing , and that is yet to come . ” — Christian Register . SERMONS ON CHRISTIAN COMMUNION . Designed to promote the Culture of the Religious Affections . Edited by Rev . T. R . SULLIVAN . 12mo . pp . 403 . Price , $ 1. 00 . This work is not confined to the subject of the Lord 's Supper , but “ forms a series of practical discourses of the persuasive kind , relating to repentance , or the duty of commencing the Christian course ,— to edification , or the encouragements to progressive Christian improvement ,— and to the eucharistic service , as affording exercise for all the grateful and devout affections of the heart in every stage of its subjection to Christian discipline . ” — Preface . The following is a list of the writers :— Rev . H. A . MILES , Lowell . " F. PARKMAN , D. D ., Boston . " S. JUDD , Augusta . " F. D . HUNTINGTON , Boston . " C. T . BROOKS , Newport . " N. HALL , Dorchester . " J. I. T . COOLIDGE , Boston . " G. W . BRIGGS , Plymouth . " A. A. LIVERMORE , Keene . " J. WHITMAN , Lexington . " J. W . THOMPSON , Salem . " H. W . BELLOWS , New York . " E.

MUZZEY , Cambridge . “ The design of the work is admirable , and we doubt not it is admirably executed , and will promote the best interests of our churches . We chanced to open at Sermon XVIII ., on Christian Education , and were pleased to see the idea of Dr. Bushnell 's celebrated book on ‘ Christian Nurture ’ illustrated and urged in a sermon by Dr. Putnam , preached two years before Dr. Bushnell 's book made its appearance . ” — Christian Register . “ The tone of these sermons , their living interest , their unpremeditated variety in unity , fit them well for this purpose ,— close personal influence on minds of widely differing views , united in the one great aim of a Christian life . We shall probably take an early opportunity of making some selections . ” — Christian Inquirer . “ We think the volume is upon the whole one of the best volumes of discourses ever issued from the American press . ” — Boston Daily Atlas . THE GOSPEL NARRATIVES , their Origin , Peculiarities , and Transmission . By Rev . HENRY A . MILES . 16mo . pp . 174 . Price , 50 cents . This work is designed for families and Sunday Schools , and contains a comparison of each Gospel with the education , life , and character of its author , and with the purpose which he had in view in its composition ; as also an account of the transmission of the Gospels down to our time , and the evidence of their uncorrupted preservation . “ This volume by Mr . Miles has substantial value . It is by the circulation and use of such books that Christian knowledge is to be extended , and Christian faith confirmed . By a thorough study even of this small work in childhood , many persons might have the satisfaction of carrying through life a clear and connected idea of the biographies of Jesus , and of the nature of the external evidence in their favor , instead of remaining in vague uncertainty on the whole subject . Bringing into a simple and popular form , and small compass , information not hitherto accessible , except to a limited number of persons , the ‘ Gospel Narratives ’ will be interesting to the general reader , whether youthful or adult . It must , without doubt , be introduced in all our Sunday Schools , and will rank among the most important manuals . ” NAOMI ; or Boston Two Hundred Years Ago . A Tale of the Quaker Persecution in New England . By ELIZA BUCKMINSTER LEE , Author of “ The Life of Jean Paul . ” Second Edition . 12mo . pp . 324 . Price , 75 cents . The first edition of this popular book was exhausted within a month after its publication . “ Mrs. Lee has given the public a most agreeable book . Her style is elevated and earnest . Her sentiments , of the pure and the true . The characters are well conceived , and are presented each in strong individuality , and with such apparent truthfulness as almost to leave us in doubt whether they are ‘ beings of the mind , ’ or were real men and women who bore the parts she assigns them in those dark tragedies that stained this ‘ fair heritage of freedom ’ in the early days of Massachusetts . ” — Worcester Palladium . “ We have been exceedingly interested in this book , and recommend it as a beautiful picture of female piety and quiet heroism , set in a frame of history and tradition , that cannot fail to please every one connected , however remotely , with the land of the Puritans . The accomplished author of ‘ The Life of Jean Paul ’ has produced an American novel which we should like to see followed by others illustrative of the facts and manners of the olden time . ” — Christian Inquirer . THE MARRIAGE OFFERING . Designed as a Gift to the Newly-married . Edited by Rev . A. A. LIVERMORE . 16mo . pp . 215 . Price , 50 cents . “ It was a happy thought that suggested such a volume . We were not aware before that there was so much and so various Christian literature on the subject . ” — Christian Register . MARTYRIA ; a Legend , wherein are contained Homilies , Conversations , and Incidents of the Reign of Edward the Sixth . Written by WILLIAM MOUNTFORD , Clerk . With an Introduction to the American Edition , by Rev . F. D . HUNTINGTON . 16mo . pp . 348 . Price , 75 cents . “ The charm of the book lies in the elevated tone of thought and moral sentiment which pervades it . You feel , on closing the volume , as if leaving some ancient cathedral , where your soul had been mingling with ascending anthems and prayers . There is scarcely a page which does not contain some fine strain of thought or sentiment , over which you shut the book that you may pause and meditate . “ We recommend the volume to our readers , with the assurance that they will find few works in the current literature of the day so well worth perusal . ” — Christian Register . “ This is really an original book . We have seen nothing for a long time more fresh or true . The writer has succeeded wonderfully , in taking himself and his readers into the heart of the age he describes . What is more , he has uttered words and thoughts which stir up the deep places of the soul . Let those read who wish to commune with the true and unpretending martyr-spirit , the spread of faith and endurance , courage , self denial , forgiveness , prayer . “ Of all the treatises we have ever read on marriage , we have seen none so good as one here called a ‘ Marriage Sermon ’ ; not that we would ask any couple to hear it all on their marriage day , but we commend it to all who are married , or intend to be . The whole book is precious . ” — Providence Journal . “ There are few religious books which breathe a finer spirit than this singular volume . The author 's mind seems to have meditated deeply on the awful realities of life . In the thoughtful flow of his periods , and the grave , earnest eloquence of particular passages , we are sometimes reminded of the Old English prose writers . The work is a ‘ curiosity ’ of literature , well worth an attentive perusal . ” — Graham 's Magazine . A TRANSLATION OF PAUL 'S EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS , with an Introduction and Notes . By WILLIAM A. WHITWELL , Minister of the Congregational Society in Wilton , N. H. 16mo . pp . 116 . Price , 50 cents . “ We would express a high opinion of the book , and can assure the Christian reader who will compare it carefully with our common version , that he will rise up from the joint perusal of the two with a better understanding of Paul than he had before . ” — Christian Register . CHRISTIANITY THE DELIVERANCE OF THE SOUL AND ITS LIFE . By WILLIAM MOUNTFORD . With an Introduction by Rev . F. D . HUNTINGTON . 16mo . pp . 118 . Price , 37-1 / 2 cents . “ Mr. Mountford is full of warm religious feeling . He brings religion home to the heart , and applies it as the guide of the life . ” — London Inquirer . SELF-FORMATION ; or the History of an Individual Mind : Intended as a Guide for the Intellect through Difficulties to Success . By a Fellow of a College . 12mo . pp . 504 . Price , $ 1. 00 . “ The publishers have done good service by bringing forward an American edition of this work . It may be most unreservedly recommended , especially to the young . ” — Daily Advertiser . “ Your gift of ‘ Self-Formation ’ is truly a welcome one , and I am greatly obliged to you for it . It is a work of quite original character , and I esteem it ( in common with all I know of , who have read it ) as possessed of very rare merit . I am glad , for the cause of good education and sound principle , that you have republished it , and I wish every young man and woman in the community might be induced to read it carefully . It is several years since I looked into it in the English edition ,— but I yet retain a vivid impression of the great delight it afforded me , and I shall gladly avail of the opportunity of renewing it . ” — Extract from a Letter . “ This is emphatically a good book , which may be read with profit by all classes , but more especially by young men , to whose wants it is admirably adapted . The American editor is no doubt right in saying , that it is almost without a question the most valuable and useful work on self education that has appeared in our own , if not in any other language . ” — New York Tribune . THOUGHTS ON MORAL AND SPIRITUAL CULTURE . By Rev . ROBERT C. WATERSTON . Second Edition , revised . 16mo . pp . 302 . Price , 62-1 / 2 cents . This book has met with a ready sale in this country , and has been republished in England . A London periodical , in reviewing it , says :— “ We will venture to predict that it will soon take its place on the shelves of our religious libraries , beside Ware ‘ On the Christian Character , ’ Greenwood 's ‘ Lives of the Apostles , ’ and other works to which we might refer as standard publications , the value of which is not likely to be diminished by the lapse of time or the caprices of fashion . ” “ The sense of duty in parents and teachers may be strengthened and elevated by contemplating the high standard which is here held up to them . The style has the great merit of being an earnest one , and there are many passages which rise into genuine eloquence and the glow of poetry . ” — N. A . Review . “ The Lecture ‘ On the Best Means of exerting a Moral and Spiritual Influence in Schools , ’ no teacher , male or female , possessed of any of the germs of improvement , can read without benefit . ” — Hon . Horace Mann , Secretary of the Board of Education . DOMESTIC WORSHIP . By WILLIAM H. FURNESS , Pastor of the First Congregational Unitarian Church in Philadelphia . Third Edition . 12mo . pp . 272 . Price , 75 cents . “ We are glad to see this book . It is a work of great and peculiar excellence . It is not a compilation from other books of devotion ; nor is it made up of conventional phrases and Scripture quotations , which have been so long employed as the language of prayer , that they are repeated without thought and without feeling . It is admirably adapted to the purpose for which it was written ; and it may be read again and again with great interest and profit by any one , who desires to enrich his mind with the purest sentiments of devotion , and with the language in which it finds its best expression . Here we have the genuine utterances of religious sensibility ,— fresh , natural , and original , as they come from a mind of singular fertility and beauty , and a heart overflowing with love to God and love to man . They seem not like prayers made with hands , to be printed in a book , but real praying , full of spirit and life .... So remarkable is their tone of reality and genuineness , that we cannot bring ourselves to regard them as compositions written for a purpose , but rather as the actual utterances of a pure and elevated soul in reverent and immediate communion with the Infinite Father . ” — Christian Examiner . LAYS FOR THE SABBATH . A Collection of Religious Poetry . Compiled by EMILY TAYLOR . Revised , with Additions , by JOHN PIERPONT . 16mo . pp . 288 . Price , 75 cents . “ It is simple and unpretending : and though some of the pieces are probably familiar to most readers , they all breathe a pure and elevated spirit , and here and there is an exquisite effusion of genius , which answers to the holiest wants of the soul . “ Not only great pleasure may be derived from such a volume , but lasting and useful impressions . Many are keenly alive to the harmony of verse and the fresh outbursts of poetic feeling , who would pore with delight over such a volume , and many might thus be won to high thought and serious reflection . ” — Christian Examiner . THE YOUNG MAIDEN . Seventh Edition . By Rev . A. B . MUZZEY , Author of “ The Young Man 's Friend , ” “ Sunday School Guide , ” etc ., etc . 16mo . pp . 264 . Price , 62-1 / 2 cents .

Its purpose is excellent throughout ; and as it is everywhere governed by a just and amiable spirit , we believe it is calculated to do much good . ” — London Atlas . “ A little work , well worthy , from its good sense and good feeling , to be a permanent and favorite monitor to our fair countrywomen . ” — Morning Herald . A HISTORY OF SUNDAY SCHOOLS and of Religious Education , from the Earliest Times . By LEWIS G. PRAY . Embellished with two Engravings . 16mo . pp . 270 . Price , 62-1 / 2 cents . “ The author has been for a long period engaged in the cause of which he has now become the historian ; and if ardor , perseverance , and faithfulness in that service qualify him to write its history , we know of no one to whom it could have been more properly confided . ” — Portsmouth Journal . “ A volume of great Interest to all who have at heart the subject discussed . ” — Literary World . LIFE IN THE SICK-ROOM . Essays , by HARRIET MARTINEAU . With an Introduction to the American Edition , by MRS. FOLLEN . Second American Edition . 16mo . pp . 196 .

EUTHANASY , or Happy Talk towards the End of Life . By WILLIAM MOUNTFORD . Author of “ Martyria . ” 16mo . pp . “ This is a book which will prove an incalculable treasure to those who are in sorrow and bereavement , and cannot be perused by any thoughtful mind without pleasure and improvement . ” — Christian Examiner . THE CHRISTIAN PARENT . By Rev . A. B . MUZZEY , Author of “ The Young Maiden , ” &amp; c ., &amp; c. 16mo . Price , 75 cents . RELIGIOUS CONSOLATION . Edited by Rev . EZRA S. GANNETT . 16mo .

THOUGHTS ; selected from the Works of WILLIAM ELLERY CHANNING , D. D . 32mo . pp . 160 . Price , 37-1 / 2 cents . “ This is a diamond of a volume , the purpose of which is well expressed in the following ‘ thought ’ from Channing , which is put on the title-page :— “ ‘ Sometimes a single word , spoken by the voice of genius , goes far into the heart . A hint , a suggestion , an undefined delicacy of expression , teaches more than we gather from volumes of less gifted men . ’ “ Those who differ in theological views from the gifted Channing will of course find many thoughts in this little volume not to their taste . But those to whom any theological views have ever done much good will nevertheless prize the book for its thoughts . Thoughts they are , not faint reflections of thought . And those who would be wise above all things prize to know what can be thought on all sides of every important subject . To enrich our columns we borrow a gem or two . ” — Chronotype . “ A collection of noble thoughts , that may well take its place by the side of the celebrated thoughts of Pascal , which have in them more of metaphysics , but less that touches the human heart . It makes a beautiful pocket volume . ” — Christian Examiner . “ We have long desired to see a book of this kind , and now , from a slight examination , believe that it is well done . It is a beautiful collection of beautiful thoughts , and must be a welcome possession , not only for all who agree with Dr. Channing in his peculiar religious opinions , but for all who value lofty sentiments worthily expressed , and who by the influence of such thoughts would be strengthened to duty , or raised to a higher sphere of contemplation . ” — Christian Register . DAVID ELLINGTON . By Rev . HENRY WARE , JR. With other Extracts from his Writings . 18mo . pp . 192 . Price , 37-1 / 2 cents . “ Mr. Ware has left very few things which will do so much towards promoting the great object for which he lived and labored . The simple story of the every-day life of a good man , told as these stories are told , finds a response in the hearts of those most indifferent to the great concerns of virtue and religion ; it reaches and touches what nothing else , not the eloquent preaching of an apostle , could reach and touch . ” CHRISTIAN CONSOLATIONS . Sermons designed to furnish Comfort and Strength to the Afflicted . By Rev . A. P . PEABODY , Pastor of the South Church , Portsmouth , N. H. 16mo . pp . 320 . Price , 75 cents . “ We welcome with almost as much surprise as satisfaction the appearance of a volume of discourses as excellent as those of Mr. Peabody . They are rich in thought , and of a high order of literary merit . ” — N. A . Review . THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD . By A. B . JACOCKS . 16mo . pp . 94 . Price , 37-1 / 2 cents . GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE : with an Outline of some of its recent Developments among the Germans , embracing the Philosophical Systems of Schelling and Hegel , and Oken 's System of Nature . By J. B. STALLO , A. M ., lately Professor of Analytical Mathematics , Natural Philosophy , and Chemistry in St. John 's College , N. Y. 12mo . pp . 532 . Price , $ 1. 25 . “ It grapples with the most abstruse problems , and tugs fiercely to pluck out the heart of their mystery . No difficulty is too great for the author to meet , and none seems able to upset his theory . In truth , the book is one of the most profound ever published in Boston , and whatever opinion may be given regarding its principles , none can gainsay its vigor of understanding and reach of learning . The pertinent question , Who reads an American book ? will change somewhat its meaning , if American literature takes the abstruse direction indicated by Mr. Stallo 's volume . In that event , our books will remain unread , not because they are too shallow , but because they are too deep . ” — Boston Courier . MORNING AND EVENING MEDITATIONS , for every Day in a Month . By MISS CARPENTER ( daughter of the late Dr. Lant Carpenter ) . 16mo . pp . 312 . Price , 62-1 / 2 cents . “ The compiler of this work has rendered good service to all possessed of Christian sympathies . ” — Literary World . “ We like its spirit , and believe it will prove an excellent closet companion for those who will faithfully use it . ” — Christian Register . THE WORDS OF CHRIST ; from the New Testament . 16mo . pp . 150 . Price , 50 cents . “ The compiler has most happily collected the words of Christ , so that , by the slightest reference possible to the tables , every text is ascertained under the several heads . It will prove very beneficial to the Biblical scholar , clergyman , and Sunday-school teacher . ” — Christian World . DISCOURSES ON THE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT AND LIFE . By Rev . CYRUS A. BARTOL .

Explaining the Bible and Explaining it away . Unitarianism not mere Morality . Unitarianism Evangelical Christianity . Unitarianism does not tend to Unbelief . Dr. Watts a Unitarian . “ These topics Mr. Burnap treats with a freshness of thought which will render the volume acceptable to those who have a taste for reading of this sort , while its general merits place it in the class of works one would wish to see extensively circulated among those who think that Unitarianism has nothing to stand upon , or that it is a doctrine full of impiety . ” — Christian Examiner . THE MISCELLANEOUS WRITINGS OF F. W. P . GREENWOOD , D. D . 12mo . pp . 400 . Price , $ 1. 00 . “ It is a profitable book for any one to read ,— partly because it communicates information and offers instruction , but chiefly because its moral tone is of the healthiest kind . ” — Christian Examiner .

Twenty-eighth Edition . 18mo . pp . 562 . Price , 50 cents . Although this book has been published but four years , it is now used in forty societies , and this fact is considered sufficient to show the estimation in which it is held , and the manner in which it has stood the test of comparison with other collections . The following are some of the peculiar merits of the Christian Hymns :— the number of hymns is very large ; the variety of subjects and metres is very great ; the hymns are better adapted for singing ; the plan of arrangement is improved ; and the price is very low .
