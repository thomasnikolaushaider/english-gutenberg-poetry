    <body>
     <p>On the 14th of August , 1812 , the following advertisement appeared in most of the daily papers : -</p>
     <p>“ Rebuilding of Drury Lane Theatre .</p>
     <p>“ The Committee are desirous of promoting a free and fair competition for an Address to be spoken upon the opening of the Theatre , which will take place on the 10th of October next . They have , therefore , thought fit to announce to the public , that they will be glad to receive any such compositions , addressed to their Secretary , at the Treasury-office , in Drury Lane , on or before the 10th of September , sealed up , with a distinguishing word , number , or motto , on the cover , corresponding with the inscription on a separate sealed paper , containing the name of the author , which will not be opened unless containing the name of the successful candidate . ”</p>
     <p>Upon the propriety of this plan men 's minds were , as they usually are upon matters of moment , much divided . Some thought it a fair promise of the future intention of the Committee to abolish that phalanx of authors who usurp the stage , to the exclusion of a large assortment of dramatic talent blushing unseen in the background ; while others contended that the scheme would prevent men of real eminence from descending into an amphitheatre in which all Grub Street ( that is to say , all London and Westminster ) would be arrayed against them . The event has proved both parties to be in a degree right , and in a degree wrong . One hundred and twelve Addresses have been sent in , each sealed and signed , and mottoed , “ as per order , ” some written by men of great , some by men of little , and some by men of no talent .</p>
     <p>Many of the public prints have censured the taste of the Committee , in thus contracting for Addresses as they would for nails — by the gross ; but it is surprising that none should have censured their TEMERITY . One hundred and eleven of the Addresses must , of course , be unsuccessful : to each of the authors , thus infallibly classed with the genus irritabile , it would be very hard to deny six stanch friends , who consider his the best of all possible Addresses , and whose tongues will be as ready to laud him as to hiss his adversary . These , with the potent aid of the bard himself , make seven foes per address ; and thus will be created seven hundred and seventy-seven implacable auditors , prepared to condemn the strains of Apollo himself — a band of adversaries which no prudent manager would think of exasperating .</p>
     <p>But , leaving the Committee to encounter the responsibility they have incurred , the public have at least to thank them for ascertaining and establishing one point , which might otherwise have admitted of controversy . When it is considered that many amateur writers have been discouraged from becoming competitors , and that few , if any , of the professional authors can afford to write for nothing , and , of course , have not been candidates for the honorary prize at Drury Lane , we may confidently pronounce that , as far as regards NUMBER , the present is undoubtedly the Augustan age of English poetry . Whether or not this distinction will be extended to the QUALITY of its productions , must be decided at the tribunal of posterity ; though the natural anxiety of our authors on this score ought to be considerably diminished when they reflect how few will , in all probability , be had up for judgment .</p>
     <p>It is not necessary for the Editor to mention the manner in which he became possessed of this “ fair sample of the present state of poetry in Great Britain . ” It was his first intention to publish the whole ; but a little reflection convinced him that , by so doing , he might depress the good , without elevating the bad . He has therefore culled what had the appearance of flowers , from what possessed the reality of weeds , and is extremely sorry that , in so doing , he has diminished his collection to twenty-one . Those which he has rejected may possibly make their appearance in a separate volume , or they may be admitted as volunteers in the files of some of the newspapers ; or , at all events , they are sure of being received among the awkward squad of the Magazines . In general , they bear a close resemblance to each other ; thirty of them contain extravagant compliments to the immortal Wellington and the indefatigable Whitbread ; and , as the last - mentioned gentleman is said to dislike praise in the exact proportion in which he deserves it , these laudatory writers have probably been only building a wall against which they might run their own heads .</p>
     <p>The Editor here begs leave to advance a few words in behalf of that useful and much abused bird the Phoenix ; and in so doing he is biassed by no partiality , as he assures the reader he not only never saw one , but ( mirabile dictu ! ) never caged one , in a simile , in the whole course of his life . Not less than sixty-nine of the competitors have invoked the aid of this native of Arabia ; but as , from their manner of using him after they had caught him , he does not by any means appear to have been a native of Arabia Felix , the Editor has left the proprietors to treat with Mr. Polito , and refused to receive this rara avis , or black swan , into the present collection . One exception occurs , in which the admirable treatment of this feathered incombustible entitles the author to great praise : that Address has been preserved , and in the ensuing pages takes the lead , to which its dignity entitles it .</p>
     <p>Perhaps the reason why several of the subjoined productions of the MUSAE LONDINENSES have failed of selection , may he discovered in their being penned in a metre unusual upon occasions of this sort , and in their not being written with that attention to stage effect , the want of which , like want of manners in the concerns of life , is more prejudicial than a deficiency of talent . There is an art of writing for the Theatre , technically called TOUCH and GO , which is indispensable when we consider the small quantum of patience which so motley an assemblage as a London audience can be expected to afford . All the contributors have been very exact in sending their initials and mottoes . Those belonging to the present collection have been carefully preserved , and each has been affixed to its respective poem . The letters that accompanied the Addresses having been honourably destroyed unopened , it is impossible to state the real authors with any certainty ; but the ingenious reader , after comparing the initials with the motto , and both with the poem , may form his own conclusions .</p>
     <p>The Editor does not anticipate any disapprobation from thus giving publicity to a small portion of the Rejected Addresses ; for unless he is widely mistaken in assigning the respective authors , the fame of each individual is established on much too firm a basis to be shaken by so trifling and evanescent a publication as the present :</p>
     <p>- neque ego illi detrahere ausim Haerentem capiti multa cum laude ceronam .</p>
     <p>Of the numerous pieces already sent to the Committee for performance , he has only availed himself of three vocal Travesties , which he has selected , not for their merit , but simply for their brevity . Above one hundred spectacles , melodramas , operas , and pantomimes have been transmitted , besides the two first acts of one legitimate comedy . Some of these evince considerable smartness of manual dialogue , and several brilliant repartees of chairs , tables , and other inanimate wits ; but the authors seem to have forgotten that in the new Drury Lane the audience can hear as well as see . Of late our theatres have been so constructed , that John Bull has been compelled to have very long ears , or none at all ; to keep them dangling about his skull like discarded servants , while his eyes were gazing at pieballs and elephants , or else to stretch them out to an asinine length to catch the congenial sound of braying trumpets . An auricular revolution is , we trust , about to take place ; and as many people have been much puzzled to define the meaning of the new era , of which we have heard so much , we venture to pronounce that , as far as regards Drury Lane Theatre , the new era means the reign of ears . If the past affords any pledge for the future , we may confidently expect from the Committee of that House every thing that can be accomplished by the union of taste and assiduity . { 0 }</p>
     <p>PREFACE TO EIGHTEENTH EDITION { 1 }</p>
     <p>In the present publishing era , when books are like the multitudinous waves of the advancing sea , some of which make no impression whatever upon the sand , while the superficial traces left by others are destined to be perpetually obliterated by their successors , almost as soon as they are found , the authors of the Rejected Addresses may well feel flattered , after a lapse of twenty years , and the sale of seventeen large editions , in receiving an application to write a Preface to a new and more handsome impression . In diminution , however , of any overweening vanity which they might be disposed to indulge on this occasion , they cannot but admit the truth of the remark made by a particularly candid and good-natured friend , who kindly reminded them , that if their little work has hitherto floated upon the stream of time , while so many others of much greater weight and value have sunk to rise no more , it has been solely indebted for its buoyancy to that specific levity which enables feathers , straws , and similar trifles to defer their submersion until they have become thoroughly saturated with the waters of oblivion , when they quickly meet the fate which they had long before merited .</p>
     <p>Our ingenuous and ingenious friend furthermore observed , that the demolition of Drury Lane Theatre by fire , its reconstruction under the auspices of the celebrated Mr. Whitbread , { 2 } the reward offered by the Committee for an opening address , and the public recitation of a poem composed expressly for the occasion by Lord Byron , one of the most popular writers of the age , formed an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances which could not fail to insure the success of the Rejected Addresses , while it has subsequently served to fix them in the memory of the public , so far at least as a poor immortality of twenty years can be said to have effected that object . In fact , continued our impartial and affectionate monitor , your little work owes its present obscure existence entirely to the accidents that have surrounded and embalmed it ,— even as flies , and other worthless insects , may long survive their natural date of extinction , if they chance to be preserved in amber , or any similar substance .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The things , we know , are neither rich nor rare -</l>
       <l n="2">But wonder how the devil they got there !— POPE .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>With the natural affection of parents for the offspring of their own brains , we ventured to hint that some portion of our success might perhaps be attributable to the manner in which the different imitations were executed ; but our worthy friend protested that his sincere regard for us , as well as for the cause of truth , compelled him to reject our claim , and to pronounce that , when once the idea had been conceived , all the rest followed as a matter of course , and might have been executed by any other hands not less felicitously than by our own .</p>
     <p>Willingly leaving this matter to the decision of the public , since we cannot be umpires in our own cause , we proceed to detail such circumstances attending the writing and publication of our little work , as may literally meet the wishes of the present proprietor of the copyright , who has applied to us for a gossiping Preface . Were we disposed to be grave and didactic , which is as foreign to our mood as it was twenty years ago , we might draw the attention of the reader , in a fine sententious paragraph , to the trifles upon which the fate of empires , as well as a four-and-sixpenny volume of parodies , occasionally hangs in trembling balance . No sooner was the idea of our work conceived , than it was about to be abandoned in embryo , from the apprehension that we had no lime to mature and bring it forth , as it was indispensable that it should be written , printed , and published by the opening of Drury Lane Theatre , which would only allow us an interval of six weeks , and we had both of us other avocations that precluded us from the full command of even that limited period . Encouraged , however , by the conviction that the thought was a good one , and by the hope of making a lucky hit , we set to work con amore , our very hurry not improbably enabling us to strike out at a heat what we might have failed to produce so well , had we possessed time enough to hammer it into more careful and elaborate form .</p>
     <p>Our first difficulty , that of selection , was by no means a light one . Some of our most eminent poets — such , for instance , as Rogers and Campbell — presented so much beauty , harmony , and proportion in their writings , both as to style and sentiment , that if we had attempted to caricature them , nobody would have recognised the likeness ; and if we had endeavoured to give a servile copy of their manner , it would only have amounted , at best , to a tame and unamusing portrait , which it was not our object to present . Although fully aware that their names would , in the theatrical phrase , have conferred great strength upon our bill , we were reluctantly compelled to forego them , and to confine ourselves to writers whose style and habit of thought , being more marked and peculiar , was more capable of exaggeration and distortion . To avoid politics and personality , to imitate the turn of mind as well as the phraseology of our originals , and , at all events , to raise a harmless laugh , were our main objects ; in the attainment of which united aims , we were sometimes hurried into extravagance , by attaching much more importance to the last than to the two first . In no instance were we thus betrayed into a greater injustice than in the case of Mr. Wordsworth — the touching sentiment , profound wisdom , and copious harmony of whose loftier writings we left unnoticed , in the desire of burlesquing them ; while we pounced upon his popular ballads , and exerted ourselves to push their simplicity into puerility and silliness . With pride and pleasure do we now claim to be ranked among the most ardent admirers of this true poet ; and if he himself could see the state of his works , which are ever at our right hand , he would , perhaps , receive the manifest evidences they exhibit of constant reference and delighted re - perusal , as some sort of amende honorable for the unfairness of which we were guilty when we were less conversant with the higher inspirations of his muse . To Mr. Coleridge , and others of our originals , we must also do a tardy act of justice , by declaring that our burlesque of their peculiarities has never blinded us to those beauties and talents which are beyond the reach of all ridicule .</p>
     <p>One of us { 3 } had written a genuine Address for the occasion , which was sent to the Committee , and shared the fate it merited , in being rejected . To swell the bulk , or rather to diminish the tenuity of our little work , we added it to the Imitations ; and prefixing the initials of S. T. P. for the purpose of puzzling the critics , were not a little amused , in the sequel , by the many guesses and conjectures into which we had ensnared some of our readers . We could even enjoy the mysticism , qualified as it was by the poor compliment , that our carefully written Address exhibited no “ very prominent trait of absurdity , ” when we saw it thus noticed in the Edinburgh Review for November 1812 : -  “ An Address by S. T. P. we can make nothing of ; and professing our ignorance of the author designated by these letters , we can only add , that the Address , though a little affected , and not very full of meaning , has no very prominent trait of absurdity , that we can detect ; and might have been adopted and spoken , so far as we can perceive , without any hazard of ridicule . In our simplicity we consider it as a very decent , mellifluous , occasional prologue ; and do not understand how it has found its way into its present company . ”</p>
     <p>Urged forward by hurry , and trusting to chance , two very bad coadjutors in any enterprise , we at length congratulated ourselves on having completed our task in time to have it printed and published by the opening of the theatre . But alas ! our difficulties , so far from being surmounted , seemed only to be beginning . Strangers to the arcana of the booksellers ’ trade , and unacquainted with their almost invincible objection to single volumes of low price , especially when tendered by writers who have acquired no previous name , we little anticipated that they would refuse to publish our Rejected Addresses , even although we asked nothing for the copyright . Such , however , proved to be the case . Our manuscript was perused and returned to us by several of the most eminent publishers . { 4 } Well do we remember betaking ourselves to one of the craft in Bond-street , whom we found in a back parlour , with his gouty leg propped upon a cushion , in spite of which warning he diluted his luncheon with frequent glasses of Madeira . “ What have you already written ? ” was his first question - - an interrogatory to which we had been subjected in almost every instance . “ Nothing by which we can be known . ” “ Then I am afraid to undertake the publication . ” We presumed timidly to suggest that every writer must have a beginning , and that to refuse to publish for him until he had acquired a name , was to imitate the sapient mother who cautioned her son against going into the water until he could swim . “ An old joke — a regular Joe ! ” exclaimed our companion , tossing off another bumper . “ Still older than Joe Miller , ” was our reply ; “ for , if we mistake not , it is the very first anecdote in the facetiae of Hierocles . ” “ Ha , sirs ! ” resumed the bibliopolist , “ you are learned , are you ? So , sob !— Well , leave your manuscript with me ; I will look it over to-night , and give you an answer to-morrow . ” Punctual as the clock we presented ourselves at his door on the following morning , when our papers were returned to us with the observation — “ These trifles are really not deficient in smartness ; they are well , vastly well , for beginners ; but they will never do — never . They would not pay for advertising , and without it I should not sell fifty copies . ”</p>
     <p>This was discouraging enough . If the most experienced publishers feared to be out of pocket by the work , it was manifest , a fortiori , that its writers ran a risk of being still more heavy losers , should they undertake the publication on their own account . We had no objection to raise a laugh at the expense of others ; but to do it at our own cost , uncertain as we were to what extent we might be involved , had never entered into our contemplation . In this dilemma , our Addresses , now in every sense rejected , might probably have never seen the light , had not some good angel whispered us to betake ourselves to Mr. John Miller , a dramatic publisher , then residing in Bow Street , Covent Garden . No sooner had this gentleman looked over our manuscript , than he immediately offered to take upon himself all the risk of publication , and to give us half the profits , SHOULD THERE BE ANY ; a liberal proposition , with which we gladly closed . So rapid and decided was its success , at which none were more unfeignedly astonished than its authors , that Mr. Miller advised us to collect some Imitations of Horace , which had appeared anonymously in the Monthly Mirror , { 5 } offering to publish them upon the same terms . We did so accordingly ; and as new editions of the Rejected Addresses were called for in quick succession , we were shortly enabled to sell our half copyright in the two works to Mr. Miller for one thousand pounds ! We have entered into this unimportant detail , not to gratify any vanity of our own , but to encourage such literary beginners as may be placed in similar circumstances ; as well as to impress upon publishers the propriety of giving more consideration to the possible merit of the works submitted to them , than to the mere magic of a name .</p>
     <p>To the credit of the genus irritabile be it recorded , that not one of those whom we had parodied or burlesqued ever betrayed the least soreness on the occasion , or refused to join in the laugh that we had occasioned . With most of them we subsequently formed acquaintanceship ; while some honoured us with an intimacy which still continues , where it has not been severed by the rude hand of Death . Alas ! it is painful to reflect , that of the twelve writers whom we presumed to imitate , five are now no more ; the list of the deceased being unhappily swelled by the most illustrious of all , the clarum et venerabile nomen of Sir Walter Scott ! From that distinguished writer , whose transcendent talents were only to be equalled by his virtues and his amiability , we received favours and notice , both public and private , which it will be difficult to forget , because we had not the smallest claim upon his kindness . “ I certainly must have written this myself ! ” said that fine-tempered man to one of the authors , pointing to the description of the Fire , “ although I forget upon what occasion . ” Lydia White , { 6 } a literary lady who was prone to feed the lions of the day , invited one of us to dinner ; but , recollecting afterwards that William Spencer { 7 } formed one of the party , wrote to the latter to put him off , telling him that a man was to be at her table whom he “ would not like to meet . ” “ Pray , who is this whom I should not like to meet ? ” inquired the poet . “ O ! ” answered the lady , “ one of those men who have made that shameful attack upon you ! ” “ The very man upon earth I should like to know ! ” rejoined the lively and careless bard . The two individuals accordingly met , and have continued fast friends ever since . Lord Byron , too , wrote thus to Mr. Murray from Italy — “ Tell him I forgive him , were he twenty times over our satirist . ”</p>
     <p>It may not be amiss to notice , in this place , one criticism of a Leicestershire clergyman , which may be pronounced unique : “ I do not see why they should have been rejected , ” observed the matter-of-fact annotator ; “ I think some of them very good ! ” Upon the whole , few have been the instances , in the acrimonious history of literature , where a malicious pleasantry like the Rejected Addresses — which the parties ridiculed might well consider more annoying than a direct satire — instead of being met by querulous bitterness or petulant retaliation , has procured for its authors the acquaintance , or conciliated the good-will , of those whom they had the most audaciously burlesqued .</p>
     <p>In commenting on a work , however trifling , which has survived the lapse of twenty years , an author may almost claim the privileged garrulity of age ; yet even in a professedly gossiping Preface , we begin to fear that we are exceeding our commission , and abusing the patience of the reader . If we are doing so , we might urge extenuating circumstances , which will explain , though they may not excuse , our diffuseness . To one of us the totally unexpected success of this little work proved an important event , since it mainly decided him , some years afterwards , to embark in the literary career which the continued favour of that novel-reading world has rendered both pleasant and profitable to him . This is the first , as it will probably be the last , occasion upon which we shall ever intrude ourselves personally on the public notice ; and we trust that our now doing so will stand excused by the reasons we have adduced .</p>

      <docImprint>Hail , glorious edifice , stupendous work ! God bless the Regent and the Duke of York ! Ye Muses ! by whose aid I cried down Fox , Grant me in Drury Lane a private box , Where I may loll , cry Bravo ! and profess The boundless powers of<country>England</country>'s glorious press ; While Afric 's sons exclaim , from shore to shore , “ Quashee ma boo ! ” — the slave-trade is no more ! In fair Arabia ( happy once , now stony , Since ruined by that arch apostate Boney ) , A Phoenix late was caught : the Arab host Long ponder 'd — part would boil it , part would roast , But while they ponder , up the pot-lid flies , Fledged , beak 'd , and claw 'd , alive they see him rise To heaven , and caw defiance in the skies . So Drury , first in roasting flames consumed , Then by old renters to hot water doom 'd , By Wyatt 's { 8 } trowel patted , plump and sleek , Soars without wings , and caws without a beak . Gallia 's stern despot shall in vain advance From<settlement>Paris</settlement>, the metropolis of<country>France</country>; By this day month the monster shall not gain A foot of land in Portugal or<country>Spain</country>. See Wellington in Salamanca 's field Forces his favourite general to yield , Breaks through his lines , and leaves his boasted Marmont Expiring on the plain without his arm on ;<settlement>Madrid</settlement>he enters at the cannon 's mouth , And then the villages still further south . Base Buonaparte , fill 'd with deadly ire , Sets , one by one , our playhouses on fire . Some years ago he pounced with deadly glee on The Opera House , then burnt down the Pantheon ; Nay , still unsated , in a coat of flames , Next at Millbank he cross 'd the river Thames ; Thy hatch , O Halfpenny ! { 9 } pass 'd in a trice , Boil 'd some black pitch , and burnt down Astley 's twice ; Then buzzing on through ether with a vile hum , Turn 'd to the left hand , fronting the Asylum , And burnt the Royal Circus in a hurry -  ( ‘ Twas call 'd the Circus then , but now the Surrey ) . Who burnt ( confound his soul ! ) the houses twain Of Covent Garden and of Drury Lane ? { 10 } Who , while the British squadron lay off Cork , ( God bless the Regent and the Duke of York ! ) With a foul earthquake ravaged the Caraccas , And raised the price of dry goods and tobaccos ? Who makes the quartern loaf and Luddites rise ? Who fills the butchers ’ shops with large blue flies ? Who thought in flames St. James 's court to pinch ? { 11 } Who burnt the wardrobe of poor Lady Finch ? - Why he , who , forging for this isle a yoke , Reminds me of a line I lately spoke , “ The tree of freedom is the British oak . ” Bless every man possess 'd of aught to give ; Long may Long Tylney Wellesley Long Pole live ; { 12 } God bless the Army , bless their coats of scarlet , God bless the Navy , bless the Princess Charlotte ; God bless the Guards , though worsted Gallia scoff ; God bless their pig-tails , though they 're now cut off ; And , oh ! in Downing Street should Old Nick revel ,<country>England</country>'s prime minister , then bless the devil !</docImprint>

      <head>HAMPSHIRE FARMER 'S ADDRESS — BY W. C. { 99 }</head>
       <l n="1">TO THE SECRETARY OF THE MANAGING COMMITTEE OF DRURY-LANE PLAYHOUSE .</l>
       <l n="2">SIR ,</l>
     </lg>
     <p>To the gewgaw fetters of RHYME ( invented by the monks to enslave the people ) I have a rooted objection . I have therefore written an address for your Theatre in plain , homespun , yeoman 's prose ; in the doing whereof I hope I am swayed by nothing but an INDEPENDENT wish to open the eyes of this gulled people , to prevent a repetition of the dramatic BAMBOOZLING they have hitherto laboured under . If you like what I have done , and mean to make use of it , I do n't want any such ARISTOCRATIC reward as a piece of plate with two griffins sprawling upon it , or a DOG and a JACKASS fighting for a ha'p ' worth of GILT GINGERBREAD , or any such Bartholomew-fair nonsense . All I ask is that the door-keepers of your play-house may take all the SETS OF MY REGISTER { 24 } now on hand , and FORCE every body who enters your doors to buy one , giving afterwards a debtor and creditor account of what they have received , POST-PAID , and in due course remitting me the money and unsold Registers , CARRIAGE-PAID .</p>
     <p>I am , &amp; c. W. C .</p>

      <head>IN THE CHARACTER OF A HAMPSHIRE FARMER .</head>
       <l n="1">- “ Rabida qui concitus ira</l>

     </lg>
     <p>MOST THINKING PEOPLE ,</p>
     <p>When persons address an audience from the stage , it is usual , either in words or gesture , to say , “ Ladies and Gentlemen , your servant . ” If I were base enough , mean enough , paltry enough , and BRUTE BEAST enough , to follow that fashion , I should tell two lies in a breath . In the first place , you are NOT Ladies and Gentlemen , but I hope something better , that is to say , honest men and women ; and in the next place , if you were ever so much ladies , and ever so much gentlemen , I am not , NOR EVER WILL BE , your humble servant . You see me here , MOST THINKING PEOPLE , by mere chance . I have not been within the doors of a play-house before for these ten years ; nor , till that abominable custom of taking money at the doors is discontinued , will I ever sanction a theatre with my presence . The stage-door is the only gate of FREEDOM in the whole edifice , and through that I made my way from Bagshaw 's { 25 } in Brydges Street , to accost you . Look about you . Are you not all comfortable ? Nay , never slink , mun ; speak out , if you are dissatisfied , and tell me so before I leave town . You are now ( thanks to MR. WHITBREAD ) got into a large , comfortable house . Not into a GIMCRACK-PALACE ; not into a SOLOMON 'S TEMPLE ; not into a frost-work of Brobdignag filigree ; but into a plain , honest , homely , industrious , wholesome , BROWN BRICK PLAYHOUSE . You have been struggling for independence and elbow-room these three years ; and who gave it you ? Who helped you out of Lilliput ? Who routed you from a rat-hole five inches by four , to perch you in a palace ? Again and again I answer , MR. WHITBREAD . You might have sweltered in that place with the Greek name { 26 } till doomsday , and neither LORD CASTLEREAGH , MR. CANNING , no , nor the MARQUESS WELLESLEY , would have turned a trowel to help you out ! Remember that . Never forget that . Read it to your children , and to your children 's children ! And now , MOST THINKING PEOPLE , cast your eyes over my head to what the builder ( I beg his pardon , the architect ) calls the proscenium . No motto , no slang , no popish Latin , to keep the people in the dark . No veluti in speculum . Nothing in the dead languages , properly so called , for they ought to die , ay and be DAMNED to boot ! The Covent Garden manager tried that , and a pretty business he made of it ! When a man says veluti in speculum , he is called a man of letters . Very well , and is not a man who cries O. P. a man of letters too ? You ran your O. P. against his veluti in speculum , and pray which beat ? I prophesied that , though I never told any body . I take it for granted , that every intelligent man , woman , and child , to whom I address myself , has stood severally and respectively in Little Russell Street , and cast their , his , her , and its eyes on the outside of this building before they paid their money to view the inside . Look at the brick-work , ENGLISH AUDIENCE ! Look at the brick-work ! All plain and smooth like a quakers ’ meeting . None of your Egyptian pyramids , to entomb subscribers ’ capitals . No overgrown colonnades of stone , { 27 } like an alderman 's gouty legs in white cotton stockings , fit only to use as rammers for paving Tottenham Court Road . This house is neither after the model of a temple in Athens , no , nor a TEMPLE in MOORFIELDS , but it is built to act English plays in : and , provided you have good scenery , dresses , and decorations , I daresay you would n't break your hearts if the outside were as plain as the pikestaff I used to carry when I was a sergeant . Apropos , as the French valets say , who cut their masters ’ throats { 28 }— apropos , a word about dresses . You must , many of you , have seen what I have read a description of , Kemble and Mrs. Siddons in Macbeth , with more gold and silver plastered on their doublets than would have kept an honest family in butchers ’ meat and flannel from year 's end to year 's end ! I am informed , ( now mind , I do not vouch for the fact ) , but I am informed that all such extravagant idleness is to be done away with here . Lady Macbeth is to have a plain quilted petticoat , a cotton gown , and a MOB CAP ( as the court parasites call it ;— it will be well for them if , one of these days , they do n't wear a mob cap — I mean a WHITE CAP , with a MOB to look at them ) ; and Macbeth is to appear in an honest yeoman 's drab coat , and a pair of black calamanco breeches . Not SALAmanca ; no , nor TALAVERA neither , my most Noble Marquess ; but plain , honest , black calamanco stuff breeches . This is right ; this is as it should be . MOST THINKING PEOPLE , I have heard you much abused . There is not a compound in the language but is strung fifty in a rope , like onions , by the Morning Post , and hurled in your teeth . You are called the mob ; and when they have made you out to be the mob , you are called the SCUM of the people , and the DREGS of the people . I should like to know how you can be both . Take a basin of broth — not CHEAP SOUP , MR. WILBERFORCE — not soup for the poor , at a penny a quart , as your mixture of horses ’ legs , brick-dust , and old shoes , was denominated — but plain , wholesome , patriotic beef or mutton broth ; take this , examine it , and you will find — mind , I do n't vouch for the fact , but I am told — you will find the dregs at the bottom , and the scum at the top . I will endeavour to explain this to you : England is a large EARTHENWARE PIPKIN ; John Bull is the BEEF thrown into it ; taxes are the HOT WATER he boils in ; rotten boroughs are the FUEL that blazes under this same pipkin ; parliament is the LADLE that stirs the hodge - podge , and sometimes -  . But , hold ! I do n't wish to pay MR. NEWMAN { 29 } a second visit . I leave you better off than you have been this many a day : you have a good house over your head ; you have beat the French in Spain ; the harvest has turned out well ; the comet keeps its distance ; { 30 } and red slippers are hawked about in Constantinople for next to nothing ; and for all this , AGAIN AND AGAIN I tell you , you are indebted to MR . WHITBREAD !! !</p>

     <p>That which was organised by the moral ability of one has been executed by the physical efforts of many , and DRURY LANE THEATRE is now complete . Of that part behind the curtain , which has not yet been destined to glow beneath the brush of the varnisher , or vibrate to the hammer of the carpenter , little is thought by the public , and little need be said by the committee . Truth , however , is not to be sacrificed for the accommodation of either ; and he who should pronounce that our edifice has received its final embellishment would be disseminating falsehood without incurring favour , and risking the disgrace of detection without participating the advantage of success .</p>
     <p>Professions lavishly effused and parsimoniously verified are alike inconsistent with the precepts of innate rectitude and the practice of external policy : let it not then be conjectured that because we are unassuming , we are imbecile ; that forbearance is any indication of despondency , or humility of demerit . He that is the most assured of success will make the fewest appeals to favour , and where nothing is claimed that is undue , nothing that is due will be withheld . A swelling opening is too often succeeded by an insignificant conclusion . Parturient mountains have now produced muscipular abortions ; and the auditor who compares incipient grandeur with final vulgarity is reminded of the pious hawkers of Constantinople , who solemnly perambulate her streets , exclaiming , “ In the name of the Prophet — figs ! ”</p>
     <p>Of many who think themselves wise , and of some who are thought wise by others , the exertions are directed to the revival of mouldering and obscure dramas ; to endeavours to exalt that which is now rare only because it was always worthless , and whose deterioration , while it condemned it to living obscurity , by a strange obliquity of moral perception constitutes its title to posthumous renown . To embody the flying colours of folly , to arrest evanescence , to give to bubbles the globular consistency as well as form , to exhibit on the stage the piebald denizen of the stable , and the half-reasoning parent of combs , to display the brisk locomotion of Columbine , or the tortuous attitudinizing of Punch ;— these are the occupations of others , whose ambition , limited to the applause of unintellectual fatuity , is too innocuous for the application of satire , and too humble for the incitement of jealousy .</p>
     <p>Our refectory will be found to contain every species of fruit , from the cooling nectarine and luscious peach to the puny pippin and the noxious nut . There Indolence may repose , and Inebriety revel ; and the spruce apprentice , rushing in at second account , may there chatter with impunity ; debarred , by a barrier of brick and mortar , from marring that scenic interest in others , which nature and education have disqualified him from comprehending himself .</p>
     <p>Permanent stage-doors we have none . That which is permanent cannot be removed , for , if removed , it soon ceases to be permanent . What stationary absurdity can vie with that ligneous barricado , which , decorated with frappant and tintinnabulant appendages , now serves as the entrance of the lowly cottage , and now as the exit of a lady 's bed-chamber ; at one time insinuating plastic Harlequin into a butcher 's shop , and , at another , yawning , as a flood-gate , to precipitate the Cyprians of St. Giles 's into the embraces of Macheath ? To elude this glaring absurdity , to give to each respective mansion the door which the carpenter would doubtless have given , we vary our portal with the varying scene , passing from deal to mahogany , and from mahogany to oak , as the opposite claims of cottage , palace , or castle may appear to require .</p>
     <p>Amid the general hum of gratulation which flatters us in front , it is fit that some regard should be paid to the murmurs of despondence that assail us in the rear . They , as I have elsewhere expressed it , “ who live to please , ” should not have their own pleasures entirely overlooked . The children of Thespis are general in their censures of the architect , its having placed the locality of exit at such a distance from the oily irradiators which now dazzle the eyes of him who addresses you . I am , cries the Queen of Terrors , robbed of my fair proportions . When the king-killing Thane hints to the breathless auditory the murders he means to perpetrate , in the castle of Macduff , “ ere his purpose cool ; ” so vast is the interval he has to travel before he can escape from the stage , that his purpose has even time to freeze . Your condition , cries the Muse of Smiles , is hard , but it is cygnet 's down in comparison with mine . The peerless peer of capers and congees { 53 } has laid it down as a rule , that the best good thing uttered by the morning visitor should conduct him rapidly to the doorway , last impressions vying in durability with first . But when , on this boarded elongation , it falls to my lot to say a good thing , to ejaculate “ keep moving , ” or to chant “ hic hoc horum genitivo , ” many are the moments that must elapse ere I can hide myself from public vision in the recesses of O. P. or P. S .</p>
     <p>To objections like these , captiously urged and querulously maintained , it is time that equity should conclusively reply . Deviation from scenic propriety has only to vituperate itself for the consequences it generates . Let the actor consider the line of exit as that line beyond which he should not soar in quest of spurious applause : let him reflect , that in proportion as he advances to the lamps , he recedes from nature ; that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional charm from encountering the cheek of beauty in the stage-box ; and that the bravura of Mandane may produce effect , although the throat of her who warbles it should not overhang the orchestra . The Jove of the modern critical Olympus , Lord Mayor of the theatric sky , { 54 } has , ex cathedra , asserted that a natural actor looks upon the audience part of the theatre as the third side of the chamber he inhabits . Surely , of the third wall thus fancifully erected , our actors should , by ridicule or reason , be withheld from knocking their heads against the stucco .</p>
     <p>Time forcibly reminds me that all things which have a limit must be brought to a conclusion . Let me , ere that conclusion arrives , recall to your recollection , that the pillars which rise on either side of me , blooming in virid antiquity , like two massy evergreens , had yet slumbered in their native quarry but for the ardent exertions of the individual who called them into life : to his never-slumbering talents you are indebted for whatever pleasure this haunt of the Muses is calculated to afford . If , in defiance of chaotic malevolence , the destroyer of the temple of Diana yet survives in the name of Erostratus , surely we may confidently predict that the rebuilder of the temple of Apollo will stand recorded to distant posterity in that of — SAMUEL WHITBREAD .</p>

       <l n="95">Atoms , attracted by some law occult ,</l>
       <l n="96">Settling in spheres , the globe was the result ;</l>
       <l n="97">Pure child of CHANCE , which still directs the ball ,</l>

       <l n="99">In ether launch 'd , the peopled bubble floats ,</l>
       <l n="100">A mass of particles and confluent motes ,</l>

       <l n="106">Down to the realms of Tartarus and night .</l>
       <l n="107">What waters melt or scorching fires consume ,</l>
       <l n="108">In different forms their being re-assume :</l>

      <head>THEATRICAL ALARM-BELL — BY THE EDITOR OF THE M. P. { 68 } { 99 }</head>
       <l n="1">“ Bounce , Jupiter , bounce ! ” — O'HARA .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ,</p>
     <p>As it is now the universally-admitted , and indeed pretty-generally - suspected , aim of Mr. Whitbread and the infamous , bloodthirsty , and , in fact , illiberal faction to which he belongs , to burn to the ground this free and happy Protestant city , and establish himself in St. James 's Palace , his fellow committeemen have thought it their duty to watch the principles of a theatre built under his auspices . The information they have received from an undoubted authority — particularly from an old fruit-woman who has turned king 's evidence , and whose name , for obvious reasons , we forbear to mention , though we have had it some weeks in our possession — has induced them to introduce various reforms — not such reforms as the vile faction clamour for , meaning thereby revolution , but such reforms as are necessary to preserve the glorious constitution of the only free , happy , and prosperous country now left upon the face of the earth . From the valuable and authentic source above alluded to , we have learnt that a sanguinary plot has been formed by some United Irishmen , combined with a gang of Luddites , and a special committee sent over by the Pope at the instigation of the beastly Corsican fiend , for destroying all the loyal part of the audience on the anniversary of that deeply-to-be-abhorred-and-highly-to-be-blamed stratagem , the Gunpowder Plot , which falls this year on Thursday the fifth of November . The whole is under the direction of a delegated committee of O. P .' s whose treasonable exploits at Covent Garden you all recollect , and all of whom would have been hung from the chandeliers at that time , but for the mistaken lenity of Government . At a given signal , a well-known O. P. was to cry out from the gallery , “ Nosey ! Music ! ” whereupon all the O. P .' s were to produce from their inside pockets a long pair of shears , edged with felt , to prevent their making any noise , manufactured expressly by a wretch at Birmingham , one of Mr. Brougham 's evidences , and now in custody . With these they were to cut off the heads of all the loyal N. P .' s in the house , without distinction of sex or age . At the signal , similarly given , of “ Throw him over ! ” which it now appears always alluded to the overthrow of our never-sufficiently-enough-to-be - deeply-and-universally-to-be-venerated constitution , all the heads of the N. P .' s were to be thrown at the fiddlers , to prevent their appearing in evidence , or perhaps as a false and illiberal insinuation that they have no heads of their own . All that we know of the further designs of these incendiaries is , that they are by-a - great-deal-too-much-too-horrible-to-be-mentioned .</p>
     <p>The Manager has acted with his usual promptitude on this trying occasion . He has contracted for 300 tons of gun powder , which are at this moment placed in a small barrel under the pit ; and a descendant of Guy Faux , assisted by Col. Congreve , has undertaken to blow up the house , when necessary , in so novel and ingenious a manner , that every O. P. shall be annihilated , while not a whisker of the N. P .' s shall be singed . This strikingly displays the advantages of loyalty and attachment to government . Several other hints have been taken from the theatrical regulations of the not-a-bit-the-less-on-that-account - to-be-universally-execrated monster Bonaparte . A park of artillery , provided with chain-shot , is to be stationed on the stage , and play upon the audience , in case of any indication of misplaced applause or popular discontent ( which accounts for the large space between the curtain and the lamps ) ; and the public will participate our satisfaction in learning that the indecorous custom of standing up with the hat on is to be abolished , as the Bow-street officers are provided with daggers , and have orders to stab all such persons to the heart , and send their bodies to Surgeons ’ Hall . Gentlemen who cough are only to be slightly wounded . Fruit-women bawling “ Bill of the Play ! ” are to be forthwith shot , for which purpose soldiers will be stationed in the slips , and ball-cartridge is to be served out with the lemonade . If any of the spectators happen to sneeze or spit , they are to be transported for life ; and any person who is so tall as to prevent another seeing , is to be dragged out and sent on board the tender , or , by an instrument to be taken out of the pocket of Procrustes , to be forthwith cut shorter , either at the head or foot , according as his own convenience may dictate .</p>
     <p>Thus , ladies and gentlemen , have the committee , through my medium , set forth the not-in-a-hurry-to-be-paralleled plan they have adopted for preserving order and decorum within the walls of their magnificent edifice . Nor have they , while attentive to their own concerns , by any means overlooked those of the cities of London and Westminster . Finding on enumeration that they have , with a with-two - hands-and-one-tongue-to be-applauded liberality , contracted for more gunpowder than they want , they have parted with the surplus to the mattock-carrying and hustings-hammering high-bailiff of Westminster , who has , with his own shovel , dug a large hole in the front of the parish-church of St. Paul , Covent Garden , that , upon the least symptom of ill-breeding in the mob at the general election , the whole of the market may be blown into the air . This , ladies and gentlemen , may at first make provisions RISE , but we pledge the credit of our theatre that they will soon FALL again , and people be supplied , as usual , with vegetables , in the in-general-strewed-with-cabbage - stalks-but-on-Saturday-night-lighted-up-with-lamps market of Covent Garden .</p>
     <p>I should expatiate more largely on the other advantages of the glorious constitution of these by-the-whole-of-Europe-envied realms , but I am called away to take an account of the ladies and other artificial flowers at a fashionable rout , of which a full and particular account will hereafter appear . For the present , my fashionable intelligence is scanty , on account of the opening of Drury Lane ; and the ladies and gentlemen who honour me will not be surprised to find nothing under my usual head ! !</p>
     <p>THE THEATRE — BY THE REV . G. C. { 68a } { 99 }</p>
     <p>“ Nil intentatum nostri liquere poetae , Nec minimum meruere decus , veetigia Graeca Ausi deserere , et celebrare domestica facta . ” HOR .</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES .</head>
      <head>If the following poem should be fortunate enough to be selected for the opening address , a few words of explanation may be deemed necessary , on my part , to avert invidious misrepresentation . The animadversion I have thought it right to make on the noise created by tuning the orchestra will , I hope , give no lasting remorse to any of the gentlemen employed in the band . It is to be desired that they would keep their instruments ready tuned , and strike off at once . This would be an accommodation to many well-meaning persons who frequent the theatre , who , not being blest with the ear of St. Cecilia , mistake the tuning for the overture , and think the latter concluded before it is begun .</head>
       <l n="1">- “ One fiddle will</l>
       <l n="2">Give , half-ashamed , a tiny flourish still , ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>was originally written “ one hautboy will ; ” but , having providentially been informed , when this poem was on the point of being sent off , that there is but one hautboy in the band , I averted the storm of popular and manageria indignation from the head of its blower : as it now stands , “ one fiddle ” among many , the faulty individual will , I hope , escape detection . The story of the flying play-bill is calculated to expose a practice much too common , of pinning play - bills to the cushions insecurely , and frequently , I fear , not pinning them at all , if these lines save one play-bill only front the fate I have recorded , I shall not deem my labour ill employed . The concluding episode of Patrick Jennings glances at the boorish fashion of wearing the hat in the one-shilling gallery . Had Jennings thrust his between his feet at the commencement of the play , he might have leaned forward with impunity , and the catastrophe I relate would not have occurred . The line of handkerchiefs formed to enable him to recover his loss , is purposely so crossed in texture and materials as to mislead the reader in respect to the real owner of any one of them : for , in the statistical view of life and manners which I occasionally present , my clerical profession has taught me how extremely improper it would be , by any allusion , however slight , to give any uneasiness , however trivial , to any individual , however foolish or wicked .</p>

      <head>GENTLEMEN ,</head>
      <head>Happening to be wool-gathering at the foot of Mount Parnassus , I was suddenly seized with a violent travestie in the head . The first symptoms I felt were several triple rhymes floating about my brain , accompanied by a singing in my throat , which quickly communicated itself to the ears of everybody about me , and made me a burthen to my friends and a torment to Doctor Apollo ; three of whose favourite servants — that is to say , Macbeth , his butcher ; Mrs. Haller , his cook ; and George Barnwell , his book-keeper — I waylaid in one of my fits of insanity , and mauled after a very frightful fashion . In this woeful crisis , I accidentally heard of your invaluable New Patent Hissing Pit , which cures every disorder incident to Grub Street . I send you inclosed a more detailed specimen of my case : if you could mould it into the shape of an address , to be said or sung on the first night of your performance , I have no doubt that I should feel the immediate effects of your invaluable New Patent Hissing Pit , of which they tell me one hiss is a dose .</head>

     <p>{ 0 } “ We have no conjectures to offer as to the anonymous author of this amusing little volume . He who is such a master of disguises may easily be supposed to have been successful in concealing himself , and , with the power of assuming so many styles , is not likely to be detected by his own . We should guess , however , that he had not written a great deal in his own character — that his natural style was neither very lofty nor very grave — and that he rather indulges a partiality for puns and verbal pleasantries . We marvel why he has shut out Campbell and Rogers from his theatre of living poets , and confidently expect to have our curiosity , in this and in all other particulars , very speedily gratified , when the applause of the country shall induce him to take off his mask . ”</p>

     <p>{ 4 } The passage , as originally written , continued thus : “ and among others , so difficult is it to form a correct judgment in catering to the public taste , by the very bibliopolist who has now , after an interval of twenty [ ONLY seven ] years , purchased the copyright from a brother bookseller , and ventured upon the present edition . ” To this , on the proof-sheet , the late Mr. Murray appended the following note : -  “ I never saw or even had the MS. in my possession ; but knowing that Mr. Smith was brother-in-law to Mr. Cadell , I took it for granted that the MS. had been previously offered to him and declined . ” Mr. H. Smith consequently drew his pen through the passage .</p>

     <p>WILLIAM THOMAS FITZGERALD .— The annotator 's first personal knowledge of this gentleman was at Harry Greville 's Pic-Nic Theatre , in Tottenham-street , where he personated Zanga in a wig too small for his head . The second time of seeing him was at the table of old Lord Dudley , who familiarly called him Fitz , but forgot to name him in his will . The Viscount 's son ( recently deceased ) , however , liberally supplied the omission by a donation of five thousand pounds . The third and last time of encountering him was at an anniversary dinner of the Literary Fund , at the Freemasons ’ Tavern . Both parties , as two of the stewards , met their brethren in a small room about half an hour before dinner . The lampooner , out of delicacy , kept aloof from the poet . The latter , however , made up to him , when the following dialogue took place :</p>
     <p>Fitzgerald ( with good humour ) . “ Mr .—, I mean to recite after dinner . ”</p>
     <p>Mr. -  . “ Do you ? ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Fitzgerald . “ Yes : you 'll have more of ‘ God bless the Regent and the</l>
       <l n="2">Duke of York ! ’ ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The whole of this imitation , after a lapse of twenty years , appears to the Authors too personal and sarcastic ; but they may shelter themselves under a very broad mantle :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Let hoarse Fitzgerald bawl</l>
       <l n="2">His creaking couplets in a tavern-hall . ” — Byron .</l>

     <p>Fitzgerald actually sent in an address to the Committee on the 31st of August , 1812 . It was published among the other Genuine Rejected Addresses , in one volume , in that year . The following is an extract : -</p>
     <lg>

     <p>{ 13 } “ The author does not , in this instance , attempt to copy any of the higher attributes of Mr. Wordsworth 's poetry ; but has succeeded perfectly in the imitation of his mawkish affectations of childish simplicity and nursery stammering . We hope it will make him ashamed of his Alice Fell , and the greater part of his last volumes — of which it is by no means a parody , but a very fair , and indeed we think a flattering , imitation . ” — JEFFERY , Edinburgh Review .</p>
     <p>{ 14 } Jack and Nancy , as it was afterwards remarked to the Authors , are here made to come into the world at periods not sufficiently remote . The writers were then bachelors . One of them [ James ] , unfortunately , still continues so , as he has thus recorded in his niece 's album :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Should I seek Hymen 's tie ,</l>
       <l n="2">As a poet I die -</l>
       <l n="3">Ye Benedicks , mourn my distresses !</l>
       <l n="4">For what little fame</l>
       <l n="5">Is annexed to my name</l>
       <l n="6">Is derived from Rejected Addresses . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The blunder , notwithstanding , remains unrectified . The reader of poetry is always dissatisfied with emendations : they sound discordantly upon the ear , like a modern song , by Bishop or Braham , introduced in Love in a Village .</p>
     <p>{ 15 } This alludes to the Young Betty mania . The writer was in the stage-box at the height of this young gentleman 's popularity . One of the other occupants offered , in a loud voice , to prove that Young Betty did not understand Shakespeare . “ Silence ! ” was the cry ; but he still proceeded . “ Turn him out ! ” was the next ejaculation . He still vociferated . “ He does not understand Shakespeare ; ” and was consequently shouldered into the lobby . “ I 'll prove it to you , ” said the critic to the doorkeeper . “ Prove what , sir ? ” “ That he does not understand Shakespeare . ” This was Moliere 's housemaid with a vengeance .</p>
     <p>Young Betty may now<span type="note_anchor">[ 1833 ]</span>be seen walking about town — a portly personage , aged about forty — clad in a furred and frogged surtout ; probably muttering to himself ( as he has been at college ) , “ O mihi praeteritos ! ” &amp; c. [ He is still alive , 1854 . Master Betty , or the “ Young Roscius , ” was born in 1791 , and made his first appearance on a London stage as Achmet in “ Barbarossa , ” at Covent Garden Theatre , on the lst of December , 1804 . He was , therefore , “ not quite thirteen . ” He lasted two seasons . ]</p>
     <p>{ 16 } A “ Phoenix ” was perhaps excusable . The first theatre in Drury Lane was called “ The Cock-pit or Phoenix Theatre . ” Whitbread himself wrote an address , it is said , for the occasion ; like the others , it had of course a Phoenix . “ But Whitbread , ” said Sheridan , “ made more of the bird than any of them ; he entered into particulars , and described its wings , beak , tail , &amp; c .; in short , it was a POULTERER 'S description of a Phoenix . ”</p>
     <p>{ 17 } For an account of this anonymous gentleman , see Preface , xiii .</p>
     <p>{ 18 } “ The author has succeeded better in copying the melody and misanthropic sentiments of Childe Harold , than the nervous and impetuous diction in which his noble biographer has embodied them . The attempt , however , indicates very considerable power ; and the flow of the verse and the construction of the poetical period are imitated with no ordinary skill . ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>
     <p>{ 19 } This would seem to show that poet and prophet are synonymous , the noble bard having afterwards returned to England , and again quitted it , under domestic circumstances painfully notorious . His good-humoured forgiveness of the Authors has already been alluded to in the Preface . Nothing of this illustrious poet , however trivial , can be otherwise than interesting . “ We know him well . ” At Mr. Murray 's dinner-table the annotator met him and Sir John Malcolm . Lord Byron talked of intending to travel in Persia . “ What must I do when I set off ? ” said he to Sir John . “ Cut off your buttons ! ” “ My buttons ! what , these metal ones ! ” “ Yes ; the Persians are in the main very honest fellows ; but if you go thus bedizened , you will infallibly be murdered for your buttons ! ” At a dinner at Monk Lewis 's chambers in the Albany , Lord Byron expressed to the writer his determination not to go there again , adding , “ I never will dine with a middle-aged man who fills up his table with young ensigns , and has looking-glass panels to his book-cases . ” Lord Byron , when one of the Drury-lane Committee of Management , challenged the writer to sing alternately ( like the swains in Virgil ) the praises of Mrs. Mardyn , the actress , who , by-the-bye , was hissed off the stage for an imputed intimacy of which she was quite innocent .</p>
     <p>The contest ran as fellows :</p>

     <p>Lord Byron at that time wore a very narrow cravat of white sarsnet , with the shirt-collar falling over it ; a black coat and waist-coat , and very broad white trousers to hide his lame foot — these were of Russia duck in the morning , and jean in the evening . His watch-chain had a number of small gold seals appended to it , and was looped up to a button of his waistcoat . His face was void of colour ; he wore no whiskers . His eyes were grey , fringed with long black lashes ; and his air was imposing , but rather supercilious . He under-valued David Hume ; denying his claim to genius on account of his bulk , and calling him , from the Heroic Epistle ,</p>
     <p>“ The fattest hog in Epicurus ’ sly . ’</p>
     <p>One of this extraordinary man 's allegations was , that “ fat is an oily dropsy . ” To stave off its visitation , he frequently chewed tobacco in lieu of dinner , alleging that it absorbed the gastric juice of the stomach , and prevented hunger . “ Pass your hand down my side , ” said his Lordship to the writer ; “ can you count my ribs ? ” “ Every one of them . ” “ I am delighted to hear you say so . I called last week on Lady -  ; ‘ Ah , Lord Byron , ’ said she , ‘ how fat you grow ! ’ But you know Lady — is fond of saying spiteful timings ! ” Let this gossip be summed up with the words of Lord Chesterfield , in his character of Bolingbroke : “ Upon the whole , on a survey of this extraordinary character , what can we say , but ‘ Alas , poor human nature ! ’ ”</p>
     <p>His favourite Pope 's description of man is applicable to Byron individually :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Chaos of thought and passion all confused ,</l>
       <l n="2">Still by himself abused or disabused ;</l>
       <l n="3">Created part to rise and part to fall ,</l>
       <l n="4">Great lord of all things , yet a slave to all ;</l>
       <l n="5">Sole judge of truth , in endless error hurled -</l>
       <l n="6">The glory , jest , and riddle of the world . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The writer never heard him allude to his deformed foot except upon one occasion , when , entering the green-room of Drury-lane , he found Lord Byron alone , the younger Byrne and Miss Smith the dancer having just left him , after an angry conference about a pas suel . “ Had you been here a minute sooner , ” said Lord B ., “ you would have heard a question about dancing referred to me : -  me ! ( looking mournfully downward ) whom fate from my birth has prohibited from taking a single step . ”</p>
     <p>{ 20 } The first stanza ( see Preface ) was written by James Smith ; the remainder by Horace .</p>
     <p>{ 21 } See Note , p. 8 . ({ 15 })</p>
     <p>{ 22 } “ Holland 's edifice . ” The late theatre was built by Holland the architect . The writer visited it on the night of its opening [ April 21 , 1794 ] . The performances were Macbeth and the Virgin Unmasked . Between the play and the farce , an excellent epilogue , written by George Colman , was excellently spoken by Miss Farren . It referred to the iron curtain which was , in the event of fire , to be let down between the stage and the audience , and which accordingly descended , by way of experiment , leaving Miss Farren between the lamps and the curtain . The fair speaker informed the audience , that should the fire break out on the stage ( where it usually originates ) , it would thus be kept from the spectators ; adding , with great solemnity -</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ No ! we assure our generous benefactors</l>
       <l n="2">‘ Twill only burn the scenery and the actors ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>A tank of water was afterwards exhibited , in the course of the epilogue , in which a wherry was rowed by a real live man , the band playing -</p>
     <p>“ And did you not hear of a jolly young waterman ? ”</p>
     <p>Miss Farren reciting -</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Sit still , there 's nothing in it ,</l>
       <l n="2">We 'll undertake to drown you in a single minute . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">“ O vain thought ! ” as Othello says . Notwithstanding the boast in the</l>

       <l n="5">“ Blow , wind — come , rack , in ages yet unborn ,</l>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>the theatre fell a victim to the flames within fifteen years from the prognostic ! These preparations against fire always presuppose presence of mind and promptness in those who are to put them into action . They remind one of the dialogue , in Morton 's Speed the Plough , between Sir Able Handy and his son Bob :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Bob . Zounds , the castle 's on fire !</l>
       <l n="2">Sir A . Yes .</l>
       <l n="3">Bob . Where 's your patent liquid for extinguishing fire ?</l>
       <l n="4">Sir A . It is not mixed .</l>
       <l n="5">Bob . Then where 's your patent fire-escape ?</l>
       <l n="6">Sir A . It is not fixed .</l>
       <l n="7">Bob . You are never at a loss ?</l>
       <l n="8">Sir A . Never .</l>
       <l n="9">Bob . Then what do you mean to do ?</l>
       <l n="10">Sir A. I do n't know . ”</l>

     <p>{ 27 } The present colonnade in Little Russell Street formed no part of the original design , and was erected only a few years back .</p>
     <p>{ 28 } An allusion to a murder then recently committed on Barnes Terrace . [ The murder ( 22nd July , 1812 ) of the Count and Countess D'Antraigues ( distantly related to the Bourbons ) , by a servant out of livery of the name of Laurence — an Italian or Piedmontese , who made away with himself immediately after . ]</p>
     <p>{ 29 } At that time keeper of Newgate . The present superintendent ( 1833 ) is styled Governor !</p>
     <p>{ 30 } A portentous one that made its appearance in the year 1811 ; in the midst of the war ,</p>
     <p>“ with fear of change Perplexing nations . ”</p>
     <p>{ 31 } “ The Living Lustres appears to us a very fair imitation of the fantastic verses which that ingenious person , Mr. Moore , indites when he is merely gallant , and , resisting the lures of voluptuousness , is not enough in earnest to be tender . ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>
     <p>{ 32 } This alludes to two massive pillars of verd antique which then flanked the proscenium , but which have since been removed . Their colour reminds the bard of the Emerald Isle , and this causes him ( more suo ) to fly off at a tangent , and Hibernicise the rest of the poem .</p>
     <p>{ 33 } “ The Rebuilding is in the name of Mr. Southey , and is one of the best in the collection . It is in the style of the Kehama of that multifarious author , and is supposed to be spoken in the character of one of his Glendoveers . The imitation of the diction and measure , we think , is nearly almost perfect ; and the descriptions as good as the original . It opens with an account of the burning of the old theatre , formed upon the pattern of the Funeral of Arvalan . ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>
     <p>{ 34 } For the Glendoveer , and the rest of the dramatis persona of this imitation , the reader is referred to the “ Curse of Kehama . ”</p>
     <p>{ 35 } “ Midnight , and yet no eye Through all the Imperial City closed in sleep . ” SOUTHEY .</p>
     <p>{ 36 } This couplet was introduced by the Authors by way of bravado , in answer to one who alleged that the English language contained no rhyme to chimney .</p>
     <p>{ 37 } Apollo . A gigantic wooden figure of this deity was erected on the roof . The writer ( horrescit referens ! ) is old enough to recollect the time when it was first placed there . Old Bishop , then one of the masters of Merchant Tailors ’ School , wrote an epigram upon the occasion , which , referring to the aforesaid figure , concluded thus :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Above he fills up Shakespeare 's place .</l>
       <l n="2">And Shakespeare fills up his below . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Very antithetical ; but quaere as to the meaning ? The writer , like Pluto , “ long puzzled his brain ” to find it out , till he was immersed “ in a lower deep ” by hearing Madame de Stael say , at the table of the late Lord Dillon , “ Buonaparte is not a man , but a system . ” Inquiry was made in the course of the evening of Sir James Mackintosh as to what the lady meant ? He answered , “ Mass ! I cannot tell . ” Madame de Stael repeats this apophthegm in her work on Germany . It is probably understood THERE .</p>
     <p>{ 38 } O. P. This personage , who is alleged to have growled like a bull-dog , requires rather a lengthened note , for the edification of the rising generation . The “ horns , rattles , drums , ” with which he is accompanied , are no inventions of the poet . The new Covent Garden Theatre opened on the 18th Sept ., 1809 , when a cry of “ Old Prices ” ( afterwards diminished to O. P .) burst out from every part of the house . This continued and increased in violence till the 23rd , when rattles , drums , whistles , and cat-calls having completely drowned the voices of the actors , Mr. Kemble , the stage-manager , came forward and said that a committee of gentlemen had undertaken to examine the finances of the concern , and that until they were prepared with their report the theatre would continue closed . “ Name them ! ” was shouted from all sides . The names were declared , viz ., Sir Charles Price , the Solicitor-General , the Recorder of London , the Governor of the Bank , and Mr. Angerstein . “ All shareholders ! ” bawled a wag from the gallery . In a few days the theatre re-opened : the public paid no attention to the report of the referees , and the tumult was renewed for several weeks with even increased violence . The proprietors now sent in hired bruisers , to MILL the refractory into subjection . This irritated most of their former friends , and , amongst the root , the annotator , who accordingly wrote the song of “ Heigh-ho , says Kemble , ” which was caught up by the ballad-singers , and sung under Mr. Kemble 's house-windows in Great Russell-street . A dinner was given at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand , to celebrate the victory obtained by W. Clifford in his action against Brandon the box-keeper , for assaulting him for wearing the letters O. P. in his hat . At this dinner Mr. Kemble attended , and matters were compromised by allowing the advanced price ( seven shillings ) to the boxes . The writer remembers a former riot of a similar sort at the same theatre ( in the year 1792 ) , when the price to the boxes was raised from five shillings to six . That tumult , however , only lasted three nights .</p>
     <p>{ 39 } “ From the knobb 'd bludgeon to the taper switch . ” This image is not the creation of the poets : it sprang from reality . The Authors happened to be at the Royal Circus when “ God save the King ” was called for , accompanied by a cry of “ Stand up ! ” and “ Hats off ! ” An inebriated naval lieutenant , perceiving a gentleman in an adjoining box slow to obey the call , struck his hat off with his stick , exclaiming , “ Take off your hat , sir ! ” The other thus assaulted proved to be , unluckily for the lieutenant , Lord Camelford , the celebrated bruiser and duellist . A set-to in the lobby was the consequence , where his lordship quickly proved victorious . “ The devil is not so black as he is painted , ” said one of the Authors to the other ; “ let us call upon Lord Camelford , and tell him that we were witnesses of his being first assaulted . ” The visit was paid on the ensuing morning at Lord Camelford 's lodgings , in Bond-street . Over the fire place in the drawing-room were ornaments strongly expressive of the pugnacity of the peer . A long thick bludgeon lay horizontally supported by two brass hooks . Above this was placed parallel one of lesser dimensions , until a pyramid of weapons gradually arose , tapering to a horsewhip :</p>
     <p>“ Thus all below was strength , and all above was grace . ”</p>
     <p>Lord Camelford received his visitants with great civility , and thanked them warmly for the call ; adding , that their evidence would be material , it being his intention to indict the lieutenant for an assault . “ All I can say in return is this , ” exclaimed the peer with great cordiality , “ if ever I see you engaged in a row , upon my soul I 'll stand by you . ” The Authors expressed themselves thankful for so potent an ally , and departed . In about a fortnight afterwards [ March 7 , 1804 ] Lord Camelford was shot in a duel with Mr. Best .</p>

     <p>{ 42 } “ ‘ Drury 's Dirge , ’ by Laura Matilda , is not of the first quality . The verses , to be sure , are very smooth , and very nonsensical — as was intended ; but they are not so good as Swift 's celebrated Song by a Person of Quality ; and are so exactly in the same measure , and on the same plan , that it is impossible to avoid making the comparison .— JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>

     <p>“ ‘ A Tale of Drury , ’ by Walter Scott , is , upon the whole , admirably executed ; though the introduction is rather tame .

In front of it Moorfields extended , with broad gravel walks crossing each other at right angles . These the writer well recollects ; and Rivaz , an underwriter at Lloyd 's , his told him that he remembered when the merchants of London would parade these walks on a summer evening with their wives and daughters .

     <p>{ 52 } “ Samuel Johnson is not so good : the measure and solemnity of his sentences , in all the limited variety of their structure , are indeed imitated with singular skill ; but the diction is caricatured in a vulgar and unpleasing degree . To make Johnson call a doer ‘ a ligneous barricado , ’ and its knocker and bell its ‘ frappant and tintinnabulant appendages , ’ is neither just nor humorous ; and we are surprised that a writer who has given such extraordinary proofs of his talent for finer ridicule and fairer imitation , should have stooped to a vein of pleasantry so low , and so long ago exhausted ; especially as , in other passages of the same piece , he has shown how well qualified he was both to catch and to render the true characteristics of his original . The beginning , for example , we think excellent . ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>

     <p>{ 54 } Lord Mayor of the theatric sky . This alludes to Leigh Hunt , who , in The Examiner , at this time kept the actors in hot water . Dr. Johnson 's argument is , like many of his other arguments , specious , but untenable ; that which it defends has since been abandoned as impracticable . Mr. Whitbread contended that the actor was like a portrait in a picture , and accordingly placed the green curtain in a gilded frame remote from the foot-lights ; alleging that no performer should mar the illusion by stepping out of the frame . Dowton was the first actor who , like Manfred 's ancestor in the Castle of Otranto , took the liberty of abandoning the canon . “ Do n't tell me of frames and pictures , ” ejaculated the testy comedian ; “ if I can n't be heard by the audience in the frame , I 'll walk out of it ! ” The proscenium has since been new-modelled , and the actors thereby brought nearer to the audience .</p>
     <p>{ 55 } “ ‘ The Beautiful Incendiary , ’ by the Honourable W. Spencer , is also an imitation of great merit . The flashy , fashionable , artificial style of this writer , with his confident and extravagant compliments , can scarcely be said to be parodied in such lines . ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>
     <p>{ 56 } Sobriety , &amp; c. The good-humour of the poet upon occasion of this parody has been noticed in the Preface . “ It 's all very well for once , ” said he afterwards , in comic confidence , at his villa at Petersham , “ but do n't do it again . I had been almost forgotten when you revived me ; and now all the newspapers and reviews ring with this fashionable , trashy author . ’ ” The sand and “ filings of glass , ” mentioned in the last stanza , are referable to the well-known verses of the poet apologising to a lady for having paid an unconscionably long morning visit ; and where , alluding to Time , he says -</p>
     <lg>

The late Sir William Congreve had made a model of Drury Lane Theatre , to which was affixed an engine that , in event of fire , was made to play from the stage into every box in the house . The writer , accompanied by Theodore Hook , went to see the model at Sir William 's house in Cecil-street . “ Now I 'll duck Whitbread ! ” said Hook , seizing the water-pipe whilst he spoke , and sending a torrent of water into the brewer 's box .</p>

     <p>{ 58a } “ ‘ Fire and Ale , ’ by M. G. Lewis , exhibits not only a faithful copy of the spirited , loose , and flowing versification of that singular author , but a very just representation of that mixture of extravagance and jocularity which has impressed most of his writings with the character of a sort of farcical horror . ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>
     <p>MATTHEW GREGORY LEWIS , commonly called MONK Lewis , from his once popular romance of that name , was a good-hearted man , and , like too many of that fraternity , a disagreeable one — verbose , disputatious and paradoxical . His Monk and Castle Spectre elevated him into fame ; and he continued to write ghost-stories till , following as he did in the wake of Mrs. Radcliffe , he quite overstocked the market . Lewis visited his estates in Jamaica , and came back perfectly negro-bitten . He promulgated a new code of laws in the island , for the government of his sable subjects : one may serve for a specimen : “ Any slave who commits murder shall have his heed shaved , and be confined three days and nights in a dark room . ” Upon occasion of printing these parodies , Monk Lewis said to Lady H [ olland ] , “ Many of them are very fair , but mine is not at all like ; they have made me write burlesque , which I never do ” “ You do n't know your own talent , ” answered the lady .</p>
     <p>Lewis aptly described himself , as to externals , in the verses affixed to his Monk , as having</p>
     <p>“ A graceless form and dwarfish stature ”</p>
     <p>He had , moreover , large grey eyes , thick features , and an inexpressive countenance . In talking , he had a disagreeable habit of drawing the fore-finger of his right hand across his tight eye-lid . He affected , in conversation , a sort of dandified , drawling tone : young Harlowe , the artist , did the same . A foreigner who had but slight knowledge of the English language might have concluded , from their cadences , that they were little better than fools — “ just a born goose , ” as Terry the actor used to say . Lewis died on his passage homeward from Jamaica , owing to a dose of James 's powders injudiciously administered by “ his own mere motion . ” He wrote various plays , with various success , he had admirable notions of dramatic construction , but the goodness of his scenes and incidents was marred by the badness of his dialogue .</p>

     <p>{ 62 } “ Padmanaba , ” viz ., in a pantomime called Harlequin in Padmanaba . This elephant [ Chunee ] , some years afterwards , was exhibited over Exeter ‘ Change , where , the reader will remember , it was found necessary [ March , 1826 ] to destroy the poor animal by discharges of musketry . When he made his entrance in the pantomime above mentioned , Johnson , the machinist of the rival house , exclaimed , “ I should be very sorry if I could not make a better elephant than that ! ” Johnson was right : we go to the theatre to be pleased with the skill of the imitator , and not to look at the reality .</p>
     <p>{ 63 } “ ‘ A New Halfpenny Ballad , ’ by a Pic-Nic Poet , is a good imitation of what was not worth imitating — that tremendous mixture of vulgarity , nonsense , impudence , and miserable puns , which , under the name of humorous songs , rouses our polite audiences to a far higher pitch of rapture than Garrick or Siddons ever was able to inspire . ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</p>
     <p>{ 64 } Mr. Whitbread — it need hardly be added for the present generation of Londoners — was a celebrated brewer . Fifty years hence , and the allusion in the text may require a note which , perhaps even now ( 1854 ) , is scarcely out of place .</p>
     <p>{ 65 } “ Winsor 's patent gas ” — at that time in its infancy . The first place illumined by it was [ Jan. 28 , 1807 ] the Carlton-house side of Pall Mall ; the second , Bishopsgate Street . The writer attended a lecture given by the inventor : the charge of admittance was three shillings , but , as the inventor was about to apply to parliament , members of both houses were admitted gratis . The writer and a fellow-jester assumed the parts of senators at a short notice . “ Members of parliament ! ” was their important ejaculation at the door of entrance . “ What places , gentlemen ? ” “ Old Sarum and Bridgewater . ” “ Walk in , gentlemen . ” Luckily , the real Simon Pures did not attend . This Pall Mall illumination was further noticed in Horace in London : -</p>

Ticket-nights are those whereon the inferior actors club for a benefit : each distributes as many tickets of admission as he is able among his friends . A motley assemblage is the consequence ; and as each actor is encouraged by his own set , who are not in general play-going people , the applause comes ( as Chesterfield says of Pope 's attempts at wit ) “ generally unseasonably , and too often unsuccessfully . ”</p>

The Morning Post , in the year 1812 , congratulated its readers upon having stripped off Cobbett 's mask and discovered his cloven foot ; adding , that it was high time to give the hydra-head of Faction a rap on the knuckles ! ”</p>
     <p>{ 68a } The Rev . George Crabbe .— The writer 's first interview with this poet , who may be designated Pope in worsted stockings , took place at William Spencer 's villa at Petersham , close to what that gentleman called his gold-fish pond , though it was scarcely three feet in diameter , throwing up a jet d'eau like a thread . The venerable bard , seizing both the hands of his satirist exclaimed with a good-humoured laugh , “ Ah ! my old enemy , how do you do ? ” In the course of conversation , he expressed great astonishment at his popularity in London ; adding , “ In my own village they think nothing of me . ” The subject happening to be the inroads of time upon beauty , the writer quoted the following lines : -</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Six years had pass 'd , and forty ere the six ,</l>
       <l n="2">When Time began to play his usual tricks :</l>

     </lg>
     <p>“ That 's very good ! ” cried the bard ;— “ whose to it ? ” “ Your own . ” “ Indeed ! hah ! well , I had quite forgotten it . ” Was this affectation , or was it not ? In sooth , he seemed to push simplicity to puerility . This imitation contained in manuscript the following lines , after describing certain Sunday newspaper critics who were supposed to be present at a new play , and who were rather heated in their politics : -</p>

     <note>“ ‘ The Theatre , ’ by the Rev . G. Crabbe , we rather think , is the best piece in the collection . It is an exquisite and most masterly imitation , not only of the peculiar style , but of the taste , temper , and manner of description of that most original author ; and can hardly be said to be in any respect a caricature of that style or manner — except in the excessive profusion of puns and verbal jingles - - which , though undoubtedly to be ranked among his characteristics , are never so thick sown in his original works as in this admirable imitation . It does not aim , of course , at any shadow of his pathos or moral sublimity , but seems to us to be a singularly faithful copy of his passages of mere description , ” — JEFFREY , Edinburgh Review .</note>

     <p>{ 76b } Dr. Busby gave living recitations of his translation of Lucretius , with tea and bread-and-butter . He sent in a real Address to the Drury Lane committee , which was really rejected . The present imitation professes to be recited by the translator 's son . The poet here , again , was a prophet . A few evenings after the opening of the Theatre Dr. Busby sat with his son in one of the stage-boxes . The latter to the astonishment of the audience , at the end of the play , stepped from the box upon the stage , with his father 's real rejected address in his hand , and began to recite it as follows : -</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ When energising objects men pursue ,</l>
       <l n="2">What are the prodigies they cannot do ? ”</l>

     <p>“ In one single point the parodist has failed — there is a certain Dr. Busby , whose supposed address is a translation called ‘ Architectural Atoms , intended to be recited by the translator 's son . ’ Unluckily , however , for the wag who had prepared this fun , the genuine serious absurdity of Dr. Busby and his son has cast all his humour into the shade . The Doctor from the boxes , and the son from the stage , have actually endeavoured , it seems , to recite addresses , which they call MONOLOGUES and UNALOGUES ; and which , for extravagant folly , tumid meanness , and vulgar affectation , set all the powers of parody at utter defiance . ” — Quarterly Review .</p>
     <p>“ Of ‘ Architectural Atoms , ’ translated by Dr. Busby , we can say very little more than that they appear to us to be far more capable of combining into good poetry than the few lines we were able to read of the learned Doctor 's genuine address in the newspapers .
