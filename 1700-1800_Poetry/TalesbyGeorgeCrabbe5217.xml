    <head>TALE I .</head>
    <head>THE DUMB ORATORS ; OR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">With fair round belly , with good capon lined ,</l>
     <l n="2">With eyes severe -</l>
     <l n="3">Full of wise saws and modern instances .</l>
     <l n="4">SHAKESPEARE , As You Like It .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Deep shame hath struck me dumb .</l>
     <l n="6">King John .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">He gives the bastinado with his tongue ;</l>
     <l n="8">Our ears are cudgell 'd .</l>
     <l n="9">King John .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">. . . . . . . Let 's kill all the lawyers ;</l>
     <l n="11">Now show yourselves men ; ‘ tis for liberty :</l>
     <l n="12">We will not leave one lord or gentleman .</l>
     <l n="13">2 Henry VI .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="14">And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges .</l>
     <l n="15">Twelfth Night .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="16">That all men would be cowards if they dare ,</l>
     <l n="17">Some men we know have courage to declare ;</l>
     <l n="18">And this the life of many a hero shows ,</l>
     <l n="19">That , like the tide , man 's courage ebbs and flows :</l>
     <l n="20">With friends and gay companions round them , then</l>
     <l n="21">Men boldly speak and have the hearts of men ;</l>
     <l n="22">Who , with opponents seated miss the aid</l>
     <l n="23">Of kind applauding looks , and grow afraid ;</l>
     <l n="24">Like timid travelers in the night , they fear</l>
     <l n="25">Th ’ assault of foes , when not a friend is near .</l>
     <l n="26">In contest mighty , and of conquest proud ,</l>
     <l n="27">Was Justice Bolt , impetuous , warm , and loud ;</l>
     <l n="28">His fame , his prowess all the country knew ,</l>
     <l n="29">And disputants , with one so fierce , were few :</l>
     <l n="30">He was a younger son , for law design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">With dauntless look and persevering mind ;</l>
     <l n="32">While yet a clerk , for disputation famed ,</l>
     <l n="33">No efforts tired him , and no conflicts tamed .</l>
     <l n="34">Scarcely he bade his master 's desk adieu ,</l>
     <l n="35">When both his brothers from the world withdrew .</l>
     <l n="36">An ample fortune he from them possessed ,</l>
     <l n="37">And was with saving care and prudence bless 'd .</l>
     <l n="38">Now would he go and to the country give</l>
     <l n="39">Example how an English ‘ squire should live ;</l>
     <l n="40">How bounteous , yet how frugal man may be ,</l>
     <l n="41">By well-order 'd hospitality ;</l>
     <l n="42">He would the rights of all so well maintain .</l>
     <l n="43">That none should idle be , and none complain .</l>
     <l n="44">All this and more he purposed — and what man</l>
     <l n="45">Could do , he did to realise his plan ;</l>
     <l n="46">But time convinced him that we cannot keep</l>
     <l n="47">A breed of reasoners like a flock of sheep ;</l>
     <l n="48">For they , so far from following as we lead ,</l>
     <l n="49">Make that a cause why they will not proceed .</l>
     <l n="50">Man will not follow where a rule is shown ,</l>
     <l n="51">But loves to take a method of his own :</l>
     <l n="52">Explain the way with all your care and skill ,</l>
     <l n="53">This will he quit , if but to prove he will . -</l>
     <l n="54">Yet had our Justice honour — and the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="55">Awed by his presence , their respect avow 'd .</l>
     <l n="56">In later years he found his heart incline ,</l>
     <l n="57">More than in youth , to gen'rous food and wine ;</l>
     <l n="58">But no indulgence check 'd the powerful love</l>
     <l n="59">He felt to teach , to argue , and reprove .</l>
     <l n="60">Meetings , or public calls , he never miss 'd -</l>
     <l n="61">To dictate often , always to assist .</l>
     <l n="62">Oft he the clergy join 'd , and not a cause</l>
     <l n="63">Pertain 'd to them but he could quote the laws ;</l>
     <l n="64">He upon tithes and residence display 'd</l>
     <l n="65">A fund of knowledge for the hearer 's aid ;</l>
     <l n="66">And could on glebe and farming , wool and grains</l>
     <l n="67">A long discourse , without a pause , maintain .</l>
     <l n="68">To his experience and his native sense</l>
     <l n="69">He join 'd a bold imperious eloquence ;</l>
     <l n="70">The grave , stern look of men inform 'd and wise ,</l>
     <l n="71">A full command of feature , heart , and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="72">An awe-compelling frown , and fear-inspiring size .</l>
     <l n="73">When at the table , not a guest was seen</l>
     <l n="74">With appetite so lingering , or so keen ;</l>
     <l n="75">But when the outer man no more required ,</l>
     <l n="76">The inner waked , and he was man inspired .</l>
     <l n="77">His subjects then were those , a subject true</l>
     <l n="78">Presents in fairest form to public view ;</l>
     <l n="79">Of church and state , of law , with mighty strength</l>
     <l n="80">Of words he spoke , in speech of mighty length :</l>
     <l n="81">And now , into the vale of years declined ,</l>
     <l n="82">He hides too little of the monarch-mind :</l>
     <l n="83">He kindles anger by untimely jokes ,</l>
     <l n="84">And opposition by contempt provokes ;</l>
     <l n="85">Mirth he suppresses by his awful frown ,</l>
     <l n="86">And humble spirits , by disdain , keeps down ;</l>
     <l n="87">Blamed by the mild , approved by the severe ,</l>
     <l n="88">The prudent fly him , and the valiant fear .</l>
     <l n="89">For overbearing is his proud discourse ,</l>
     <l n="90">And overwhelming of his voice the force ;</l>
     <l n="91">And overpowering is he when he shows</l>
     <l n="92">What floats upon a mind that always overflows .</l>
     <l n="93">This ready man at every meeting rose ,</l>
     <l n="94">Something to hint , determine , or propose ;</l>
     <l n="95">And grew so fond of teaching , that he taught</l>
     <l n="96">Those who instruction needed not or sought :</l>
     <l n="97">Happy our hero , when he could excite</l>
     <l n="98">Some thoughtless talker to the wordy fight :</l>
     <l n="99">Let him a subject at his pleasure choose ,</l>
     <l n="100">Physic or law , religion or the muse ;</l>
     <l n="101">On all such themes he was prepared to shine , -</l>
     <l n="102">Physician , poet , lawyer , and divine .</l>
     <l n="103">Hemm 'd in by some tough argument , borne down</l>
     <l n="104">By press of language and the awful frown ,</l>
     <l n="105">In vain for mercy shall the culprit plead ;</l>
     <l n="106">His crime is past , and sentence must proceed :</l>
     <l n="107">Ah ! suffering man , have patience , bear thy woes -</l>
     <l n="108">For lo ! the clock — at ten the Justice goes .</l>
     <l n="109">This powerful man , on business , or to please</l>
     <l n="110">A curious taste , or weary grown of ease ,</l>
     <l n="111">On a long journey travelled many a mile</l>
     <l n="112">Westward , and halted midway in our isle ;</l>
     <l n="113">Content to view a city large and fair ,</l>
     <l n="114">Though none had notice — what a man was there !</l>
     <l n="115">Silent two days , he then began to long</l>
     <l n="116">Again to try a voice so loud and strong ;</l>
     <l n="117">To give his favourite topics some new grace ,</l>
     <l n="118">And gain some glory in such distant place ;</l>
     <l n="119">To reap some present pleasure , and to sow</l>
     <l n="120">Seeds of fair fame , in after-time to grow :</l>
     <l n="121">Here will men say , “ We heard , at such an hour ,</l>
     <l n="122">The best of speakers — wonderful his power . ”</l>
     <l n="123">Inquiry made , he found that day would meet</l>
     <l n="124">A learned club , and in the very street :</l>
     <l n="125">Knowledge to gain and give , was the design ;</l>
     <l n="126">To speak , to hearken , to debate , and dine :</l>
     <l n="127">This pleased our traveller , for he felt his force</l>
     <l n="128">In either way , to eat or to discourse .</l>
     <l n="129">Nothing more easy than to gain access</l>
     <l n="130">To men like these , with his polite address :</l>
     <l n="131">So he succeeded , and first look 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="132">To view his objects and to take his ground ;</l>
     <l n="133">And therefore silent chose awhile to sit ,</l>
     <l n="134">Then enter boldly by some lucky hit ;</l>
     <l n="135">Some observation keen or stroke severe ,</l>
     <l n="136">To cause some wonder or excite some fear .</l>
     <l n="137">Now , dinner past , no longer he supprest</l>
     <l n="138">His strong dislike to be a silent guest ;</l>
     <l n="139">Subjects and words were now at his command -</l>
     <l n="140">When disappointment frown 'd on all he plann 'd ;</l>
     <l n="141">For , hark !— he heard amazed , on every side ,</l>
     <l n="142">His church insulted and her priests belied ;</l>
     <l n="143">The laws reviled , the ruling power abused ,</l>
     <l n="144">The land derided , and its foes excused : -</l>
     <l n="145">He heard and ponder 'd — What , to men so vile ,</l>
     <l n="146">Should be his language ?— For his threat'ning style</l>
     <l n="147">They were too many ;— if his speech were meek ,</l>
     <l n="148">They would despise such poor attempts to speak :</l>
     <l n="149">At other times with every word at will ,</l>
     <l n="150">He now sat lost , perplex 'd , astonish 'd , still .</l>
     <l n="151">Here were Socinians , Deists , and indeed</l>
     <l n="152">All who , as foes to England 's Church , agreed ;</l>
     <l n="153">But still with creeds unlike , and some without a creed :</l>
     <l n="154">Here , too , fierce friends of liberty he saw ,</l>
     <l n="155">Who own 'd no prince and who obey no law ;</l>
     <l n="156">There were reformers of each different sort ,</l>
     <l n="157">Foes to the laws , the priesthood , and the court ;</l>
     <l n="158">Some on their favourite plans alone intent ,</l>
     <l n="159">Some purely angry and malevolent :</l>
     <l n="160">The rash were proud to blame their country 's laws ;</l>
     <l n="161">The vain , to seem supporters of a cause ;</l>
     <l n="162">One call 'd for change , that he would dread to see ;</l>
     <l n="163">Another sigh 'd for Gallic liberty !</l>
     <l n="164">And numbers joining with the forward crew ,</l>
     <l n="165">For no one reason — but that numbers do .</l>
     <l n="166">“ How , ” said the Justice , “ can this trouble rise ,</l>
     <l n="167">This shame and pain , from creatures I despise ? ”</l>
     <l n="168">And Conscience answer 'd — “ The prevailing cause</l>
     <l n="169">Is thy delight in listening to applause ;</l>
     <l n="170">Here , thou art seated with a tribe , who spurn</l>
     <l n="171">Thy favourite themes , and into laughter turn</l>
     <l n="172">Thy fears and wishes : silent and obscure ,</l>
     <l n="173">Thyself , shalt thou the long harangue endure ;</l>
     <l n="174">And learn , by feeling , what it is to force</l>
     <l n="175">On thy unwilling friends the long discourse :</l>
     <l n="176">What though thy thoughts be just , and these , it seems ,</l>
     <l n="177">Are traitors ’ projects , idiots ’ empty schemes ;</l>
     <l n="178">Yet minds , like bodies , cramm 'd , reject their food ,</l>
     <l n="179">Nor will be forced and tortured for their good ! ”</l>
     <l n="180">At length , a sharp , shrewd , sallow man arose ,</l>
     <l n="181">And begg 'd he briefly might his mind disclose ;</l>
     <l n="182">“ It was his duty , in these worst of times ,</l>
     <l n="183">T'inform the govern 'd of their rulers ’ crimes : ”</l>
     <l n="184">This pleasant subject to attend , they each</l>
     <l n="185">Prepare to listen , and forbore to teach .</l>
     <l n="186">Then voluble and fierce the wordy man</l>
     <l n="187">Through a long chain of favourite horrors ran : -</l>
     <l n="188">First of the Church , from whose enslaving power</l>
     <l n="189">He was deliver 'd , and he bless 'd the hour ;</l>
     <l n="190">“ Bishops and deans , and prebendaries all , ”</l>
     <l n="191">He said , “ were cattle fatt'ning in the stall ;</l>
     <l n="192">Slothful and pursy , insolent and mean ,</l>
     <l n="193">Were every bishop , prebendary , dean ,</l>
     <l n="194">And wealthy rector : curates , poorly paid ,</l>
     <l n="195">Were only dull ;— he would not them upbraid . ”</l>
     <l n="196">From priests he turn 'd to canons , creeds , and prayers ,</l>
     <l n="197">Rubrics and rules , and all our Church affairs ;</l>
     <l n="198">Churches themselves , desk , pulpit , altar , all</l>
     <l n="199">The Justice reverenced — and pronounced their fall .</l>
     <l n="200">Then from religion Hammond turn 'd his view</l>
     <l n="201">To give our Rulers the correction due ;</l>
     <l n="202">Not one wise action had these triflers plann 'd ;</l>
     <l n="203">There was , it seem 'd , no wisdom in the land ,</l>
     <l n="204">Save in this patriot tribe , who meet at times</l>
     <l n="205">To show the statesman 's errors and his crimes .</l>
     <l n="206">Now here was Justice Bolt compell 'd to sit ,</l>
     <l n="207">To hear the deist 's scorn , the rebel 's wit ;</l>
     <l n="208">The fact mis-stated , the envenom 'd lie ,</l>
     <l n="209">And , staring spell-bound , made not one reply .</l>
     <l n="210">Then were our Laws abused — and with the laws ,</l>
     <l n="211">All who prepare , defend , or judge a cause :</l>
     <l n="212">“ We have no lawyer whom a man can trust , ”</l>
     <l n="213">Proceeded Hammond — “ if the laws were just ;</l>
     <l n="214">But they are evil ; ‘ tis the savage state</l>
     <l n="215">Is only good , and ours sophisticate !</l>
     <l n="216">See ! the free creatures in their woods and plains ,</l>
     <l n="217">Where without laws each happy monarch reigns ,</l>
     <l n="218">King of himself — while we a number dread ,</l>
     <l n="219">By slaves commanded and by dunces led :</l>
     <l n="220">Oh , let the name with either state agree -</l>
     <l n="221">Savage our own we 'll name , and civil theirs shall be . ”</l>
     <l n="222">The silent Justice still astonish 'd sat ,</l>
     <l n="223">And wonder 'd much whom he was gazing at ;</l>
     <l n="224">Twice he essay 'd to speak — but in a cough ,</l>
     <l n="225">The faint , indignant , dying speech went off :</l>
     <l n="226">“ But who is this ? ” thought he — “ a demon vile ,</l>
     <l n="227">With wicked meaning and a vulgar style :</l>
     <l n="228">Hammond they call him : they can give the name</l>
     <l n="229">Of man to devils .— Why am I so tame ?</l>
     <l n="230">Why crush I not the viper ? ” — Fear replied ,</l>
     <l n="231">Watch him awhile , and let his strength be tried :</l>
     <l n="232">He will be foil 'd , if man ; but if his aid</l>
     <l n="233">Be from beneath , ‘ tis well to be afraid . ”</l>
     <l n="234">“ We are call 'd free ! ” said Hammond — “ doleful times ,</l>
     <l n="235">When rulers add their insult to their crimes ;</l>
     <l n="236">For should our scorn expose each powerful vice ,</l>
     <l n="237">It would be libel , and we pay the price . ”</l>
     <l n="238">Thus with licentious words the man went on ,</l>
     <l n="239">Proving that liberty of speech was gone ;</l>
     <l n="240">That all were slaves — nor had we better chance</l>
     <l n="241">For better times , than as allies to France .</l>
     <l n="242">Loud groan 'd the Stranger — Why , he must relate ,</l>
     <l n="243">And own 'd , “ In sorrow for his country 's fate ; ”</l>
     <l n="244">“ Nay , she were safe , ” the ready man replied ,</l>
     <l n="245">“ Might patriots rule her , and could reasoners guide ;</l>
     <l n="246">When all to vote , to speak , to teach , are free ,</l>
     <l n="247">Whate'er their creeds or their opinions be ;</l>
     <l n="248">When books of statutes are consumed in flames ,</l>
     <l n="249">And courts and copyholds are empty names :</l>
     <l n="250">Then will be times of joy — but ere they come ,</l>
     <l n="251">Havock , and war , and blood must be our doom . ”</l>
     <l n="252">The man here paused — then loudly for Reform</l>
     <l n="253">He call 'd , and hail 'd the prospect of the storm :</l>
     <l n="254">The wholesome blast , the fertilizing flood -</l>
     <l n="255">Peace gain 'd by tumult , plenty bought with blood :</l>
     <l n="256">Sharp means , he own 'd ; but when the land 's disease</l>
     <l n="257">Asks cure complete , no med'cines are like these .</l>
     <l n="258">Our Justice now , more led by fear than rage ,</l>
     <l n="259">Saw it in vain with madness to engage ;</l>
     <l n="260">With imps of darkness no man seeks to fight ,</l>
     <l n="261">Knaves to instruct , or set deceivers right :</l>
     <l n="262">Then as the daring speech denounced these woes ,</l>
     <l n="263">Sick at the soul , the grieving Guest arose ;</l>
     <l n="264">Quick on the board his ready cash he threw ,</l>
     <l n="265">And from the demons to his closet flew :</l>
     <l n="266">There when secured , he pray 'd with earnest seal ,</l>
     <l n="267">That all they wish 'd these patriot-souls might feel ;</l>
     <l n="268">“ Let them to France , their darling country , haste ,</l>
     <l n="269">And all the comforts of a Frenchman taste ;</l>
     <l n="270">Let them his safety , freedom , pleasure know ,</l>
     <l n="271">Feel all their rulers on the land bestow ;</l>
     <l n="272">And be at length dismiss 'd by one unerring blow , -</l>
     <l n="273">Not hack 'd and hew 'd by one afraid to strike ,</l>
     <l n="274">But shorn by that which shears all men alike ;</l>
     <l n="275">Nor , as in Britain , let them curse delay</l>
     <l n="276">Of law , but borne without a form away -</l>
     <l n="277">Suspected , tried , condemn 'd , and carted in a day ;</l>
     <l n="278">Oh ! let them taste what they so much approve ,</l>
     <l n="279">These strong fierce freedoms of the land they love . ” { 2 }</l>
     <l n="280">Home came our hero , to forget no more</l>
     <l n="281">The fear he felt and ever must deplore :</l>
     <l n="282">For though he quickly join 'd his friends again ,</l>
     <l n="283">And could with decent force his themes maintain ,</l>
     <l n="284">Still it occurr 'd that , in a luckless time ,</l>
     <l n="285">He fail 'd to fight with heresy and crime ;</l>
     <l n="286">It was observed his words were not so strong ,</l>
     <l n="287">His tones so powerful , his harangues so long ,</l>
     <l n="288">As in old times — for he would often drop</l>
     <l n="289">The lofty look , and of a sudden stop ;</l>
     <l n="290">When conscience whisper 'd , that he once was still ,</l>
     <l n="291">And let the wicked triumph at their will ;</l>
     <l n="292">And therefore now , when not a foe was near ,</l>
     <l n="293">He had no right so valiant to appear .</l>
     <l n="294">Some years had pass 'd , and he perceived his fears</l>
     <l n="295">Yield to the spirit of his earlier years -</l>
     <l n="296">When at a meeting , with his friends beside ,</l>
     <l n="297">He saw an object that awaked his pride ;</l>
     <l n="298">His shame , wrath , vengeance , indignation — all</l>
     <l n="299">Man 's harsher feelings did that sight recall .</l>
     <l n="300">For , lo ! beneath him fix 'd , our Man of Law</l>
     <l n="301">That lawless man the Foe of Order saw ;</l>
     <l n="302">Once fear 'd , now scorn 'd ; once dreaded , now abhorrd :</l>
     <l n="303">A wordy man , and evil every word :</l>
     <l n="304">Again he gazed — “ It is , ” said he “ the same</l>
     <l n="305">Caught and secure : his master owes him shame ; ”</l>
     <l n="306">So thought our hero , who each instant found</l>
     <l n="307">His courage rising , from the numbers round .</l>
     <l n="308">As when a felon has escaped and fled ,</l>
     <l n="309">So long , that law conceives the culprit dead ;</l>
     <l n="310">And back recall 'd her myrmidons , intent</l>
     <l n="311">On some new game , and with a stronger scent ;</l>
     <l n="312">Till she beholds him in a place , where none</l>
     <l n="313">Could have conceived the culprit would have gone ;</l>
     <l n="314">There he sits upright in his seat , secure ,</l>
     <l n="315">As one whose conscience is correct and pure ;</l>
     <l n="316">This rouses anger for the old offence ,</l>
     <l n="317">And scorn for all such seeming and pretence :</l>
     <l n="318">So on this Hammond look 'd our hero bold ,</l>
     <l n="319">Rememb'ring well that vile offence of old ;</l>
     <l n="320">And now he saw the rebel dar 'd t'intrude</l>
     <l n="321">Among the pure , the loyal , and the good ;</l>
     <l n="322">The crime provok 'd his wrath , the folly stirr 'd his blood :</l>
     <l n="323">Nor wonder was it , if so strange a sight</l>
     <l n="324">Caused joy with vengeance , terror with delight ;</l>
     <l n="325">Terror like this a tiger might create ,</l>
     <l n="326">A joy like that to see his captive state ,</l>
     <l n="327">At once to know his force and then decree his fate .</l>
     <l n="328">Hammond , much praised by numerous friends , was come</l>
     <l n="329">To read his lectures , so admired at home ;</l>
     <l n="330">Historic lectures , where he loved to mix</l>
     <l n="331">His free plain hints on modern politics :</l>
     <l n="332">Here , he had heard , that numbers had design ,</l>
     <l n="333">Their business finish 'd , to sit down and dine ;</l>
     <l n="334">This gave him pleasure , for he judged it right</l>
     <l n="335">To show by day that he could speak at night .</l>
     <l n="336">Rash the design — for he perceived , too late ,</l>
     <l n="337">Not one approving friend beside him sate ;</l>
     <l n="338">The greater number , whom he traced around ,</l>
     <l n="339">Were men in black , and he conceived they frown 'd .</l>
     <l n="340">“ I will not speak , ” he thought ; “ no pearls of mine</l>
     <l n="341">Shall be presented to this herd of swine ; ”</l>
     <l n="342">Not this avail 'd him , when he cast his eye</l>
     <l n="343">On Justice Bolt ; he could not fight , nor fly :</l>
     <l n="344">He saw a man to whom he gave the pain ,</l>
     <l n="345">Which now he felt must be return 'd again ;</l>
     <l n="346">His conscience told him with what keen delight</l>
     <l n="347">He , at that time , enjoy 'd a stranger 's fright ;</l>
     <l n="348">That stranger now befriended — he alone ,</l>
     <l n="349">For all his insult , friendless , to atone ;</l>
     <l n="350">Now he could feel it cruel that a heart</l>
     <l n="351">Should be distress 'd , and none to take its part ;</l>
     <l n="352">“ Though one by one , ” said Pride , “ I would defy</l>
     <l n="353">Much greater men , yet meeting every eye ,</l>
     <l n="354">I do confess a fear — but he will pass me by . ”</l>
     <l n="355">Vain hope ! the Justice saw the foe 's distress ,</l>
     <l n="356">With exultation he could not suppress ;</l>
     <l n="357">He felt the fish was hook 'd — and so forbore ,</l>
     <l n="358">In playful spite to draw it to the shore .</l>
     <l n="359">Hammond look 'd round again ; but none were near ,</l>
     <l n="360">With friendly smile to still his growing fear ;</l>
     <l n="361">But all above him seem 'd a solemn row</l>
     <l n="362">Of priests and deacons , so they seem 'd below ;</l>
     <l n="363">He wonder 'd who his right-hand man might be -</l>
     <l n="364">Vicar of Holt cum Uppingham was he ;</l>
     <l n="365">And who the man of that dark frown possess 'd -</l>
     <l n="366">Rector of Bradley and of Barton-west ;</l>
     <l n="367">“ A pluralist , ” he growl 'd — but check 'd the word ,</l>
     <l n="368">That warfare might not , by his zeal , be stirr 'd .</l>
     <l n="369">But now began the man above to show</l>
     <l n="370">Fierce looks and threat'nings to the man below ;</l>
     <l n="371">Who had some thoughts his peace by flight to seek -</l>
     <l n="372">But how then lecture , if he dar 'd not speak ! -</l>
     <l n="373">Now as the Justice for the war prepared ,</l>
     <l n="374">He seem 'd just then to question if he dared :</l>
     <l n="375">“ He may resist , although his power be small ,</l>
     <l n="376">And growing desperate may defy us all ;</l>
     <l n="377">One dog attack , and he prepares for flight -</l>
     <l n="378">Resist another , and he strives to bite ;</l>
     <l n="379">Nor can I say , if this rebellious cur</l>
     <l n="380">Will fly for safety , or will scorn to stir . ”</l>
     <l n="381">Alarm 'd by this , he lash 'd his soul to rage ,</l>
     <l n="382">Burn 'd with strong shame , and hurried to engage .</l>
     <l n="383">As a male turkey straggling on the green ,</l>
     <l n="384">When by fierce harriers , terriers , mongrels seen ,</l>
     <l n="385">He feels the insult of the noisy train</l>
     <l n="386">And skulks aside , though moved by much disdain ;</l>
     <l n="387">But when that turkey , at his own barn-door ,</l>
     <l n="388">Sees one poor straying puppy and no more ,</l>
     <l n="389">( A foolish puppy who had left the pack ,</l>
     <l n="390">Thoughtless what foe was threat'ning at his back )</l>
     <l n="391">He moves about , as ship prepared to sail ,</l>
     <l n="392">He hoists his proud rotundity of tail ,</l>
     <l n="393">The half-seal 'd eyes and changeful neck he shows ,</l>
     <l n="394">Where , in its quick'ning colours , vengeance glows ;</l>
     <l n="395">From red to blue the pendent wattles turn ,</l>
     <l n="396">Blue mix 'd with red , as matches when they burn ;</l>
     <l n="397">And thus th ’ intruding snarler to oppose ,</l>
     <l n="398">Urged by enkindling wrath , he gobbling goes .</l>
     <l n="399">So look 'd our hero in his wrath , his cheeks</l>
     <l n="400">Flush 'd with fresh fires and glow 'd in tingling streaks ,</l>
     <l n="401">His breath by passion 's force awhile restrain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="402">Like a stopp 'd current greater force regain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="403">So spoke , so look 'd he , every eye and ear</l>
     <l n="404">Were fix 'd to view him , or were turn 'd to hear .</l>
     <l n="405">“ My friends , you know me , you can witness all ,</l>
     <l n="406">How , urged by passion , I restrain my gall ;</l>
     <l n="407">And every motive to revenge withstand -</l>
     <l n="408">Save when I hear abused my native land .</l>
     <l n="409">“ Is it not known , agreed , confirm 'd , confess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="410">That , of all people , we are govern 'd best ?</l>
     <l n="411">We have the force of monarchies ; are free ,</l>
     <l n="412">As the most proud republicans can be ;</l>
     <l n="413">And have those prudent counsels that arise</l>
     <l n="414">In grave and cautious aristocracies ;</l>
     <l n="415">And live there those , in such all-glorious state .</l>
     <l n="416">Traitors protected in the land they hate ?</l>
     <l n="417">Rebels , still warring with the laws that give</l>
     <l n="418">To them subsistence ?— Yes , such wretches live .</l>
     <l n="419">“ Ours is a Church reformed , and now no more</l>
     <l n="420">Is aught for man to mend or to restore ;</l>
     <l n="421">‘ Tis pure in doctrines , ‘ tis correct in creeds ,</l>
     <l n="422">Has nought redundant , and it nothing needs ;</l>
     <l n="423">No evil is therein — no wrinkle , spot ,</l>
     <l n="424">Stain , blame , or blemish : — I affirm there 's not .</l>
     <l n="425">“ All this you know — now mark what once befell ,</l>
     <l n="426">With grief I bore it , and with shame I tell :</l>
     <l n="427">I was entrapp 'd — yes , so it came to pass ,</l>
     <l n="428">‘ Mid heathen rebels , a tumultuous class ;</l>
     <l n="429">Each to his country bore a hellish mind ,</l>
     <l n="430">Each like his neighbour was of cursed kind ;</l>
     <l n="431">The land that nursed them , they blasphemed ; the laws ,</l>
     <l n="432">Their sovereign 's glory , and their country 's cause :</l>
     <l n="433">And who their mouth , their master-fiend , and who</l>
     <l n="434">Rebellion 's oracle ?— You , catiff , you ! ”</l>
     <l n="435">He spoke , and standing stretch 'd his mighty arm ,</l>
     <l n="436">And fix 'd the Man of Words , as by a charm .</l>
     <l n="437">“ How raved that railer ! Sure some hellish power</l>
     <l n="438">Restrain 'd my tongue in that delirious hour ,</l>
     <l n="439">Or I had hurl 'd the shame and vengeance due</l>
     <l n="440">On him , the guide of that infuriate crew ;</l>
     <l n="441">But to mine eyes , such dreadful looks appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="442">Such mingled yell of lying words I heard ,</l>
     <l n="443">That I conceived around were demons all ,</l>
     <l n="444">And till I fled the house , I fear 'd its fall .</l>
     <l n="445">“ Oh ! could our country from our coasts expel</l>
     <l n="446">Such foes ! to nourish those who wish her well :</l>
     <l n="447">This her mild laws forbid , but we may still</l>
     <l n="448">From us eject them by our sovereign will ;</l>
     <l n="449">This let us do . ” — He said , and then began</l>
     <l n="450">A gentler feeling for the silent man ;</l>
     <l n="451">E'en in our hero 's mighty soul arose</l>
     <l n="452">A touch of pity for experienced woes ;</l>
     <l n="453">But this was transient , and with angry eye</l>
     <l n="454">He sternly look 'd , and paused for a reply .</l>
     <l n="455">‘ Twas then the Man of many Words would speak -</l>
     <l n="456">But , in his trial , had them all to seek :</l>
     <l n="457">To find a friend he look 'd the circle round ,</l>
     <l n="458">But joy or scorn in every feature found ;</l>
     <l n="459">He sipp 'd his wine , but in those times of dread</l>
     <l n="460">Wine only adds confusion to the head ;</l>
     <l n="461">In doubt he reason 'd with himself — “ And how</l>
     <l n="462">Harangue at night , if I be silent now ? ”</l>
     <l n="463">From pride and praise received , he sought to draw</l>
     <l n="464">Courage to speak , but still remain 'd the awe ;</l>
     <l n="465">One moment rose he with a forced disdain ,</l>
     <l n="466">And then , abash 'd , sunk sadly down again ;</l>
     <l n="467">While in our hero 's glance he seem 'd to read ,</l>
     <l n="468">“ Slave and insurgent ! what hast thou to plead ? ”</l>
     <l n="469">By desperation urged , he now began :</l>
     <l n="470">“ I seek no favour — I — the rights of man !</l>
     <l n="471">Claim ; and I — nay !— but give me leave — and I</l>
     <l n="472">Insist — a man — that is — and in reply ,</l>
     <l n="473">I speak , ” — Alas ! each new attempt was vain :</l>
     <l n="474">Confused he stood , he sate , he rose again ;</l>
     <l n="475">At length he growl 'd defiance , sought the door ,</l>
     <l n="476">Cursed the whole synod , and was seen no more .</l>
     <l n="477">“ Laud we , ” said Justice Bolt , “ the Powers above :</l>
     <l n="478">Thus could our speech the sturdiest foe remove . ”</l>
     <l n="479">Exulting now , he gain 'd new strength of fame ,</l>
     <l n="480">And lost all feelings of defeat and shame .</l>
     <l n="481">“ He dared not strive , you witness 'd — dared not lift</l>
     <l n="482">His voice , nor drive at his accursed drift :</l>
     <l n="483">So all shall tremble , wretches who oppose</l>
     <l n="484">Our Church or State — thus be it to our foes . ”</l>
     <l n="485">He spoke , and , seated with his former air ,</l>
     <l n="486">Look 'd his full self , and fill 'd his ample chair ;</l>
     <l n="487">Took one full bumper to each favourite cause ,</l>
     <l n="488">And dwelt all night on politics and laws ,</l>
     <l n="489">With high applauding voice , that gain 'd him high applause .</l>

     <l n="26">Minutely trace man 's life ; year after year ,</l>

     <l n="40">Beneath yon tree , observe an ancient pair -</l>

     <l n="59">And as the child grew up , there seem 'd in him</l>
     <l n="60">A more than common life in every limb ;</l>
     <l n="61">A strong and handsome stripling he became ,</l>
     <l n="62">And the gay spirit answer 'd to the frame ;</l>
     <l n="63">A lighter , happier lad was never seen ,</l>
     <l n="64">For ever easy , cheerful , or serene ;</l>
     <l n="65">His early love he fix 'd upon a fair</l>
     <l n="66">And gentle maid — they were a handsome pair .</l>
     <l n="67">They at an infant-school together play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="68">Where the foundation of their love was laid :</l>
     <l n="69">The boyish champion would his choice attend</l>
     <l n="70">In every sport , in every fray defend .</l>
     <l n="71">As prospects open 'd , and as life advanced ,</l>
     <l n="72">They walk 'd together , they together danced ;</l>
     <l n="73">On all occasions , from their early years ,</l>
     <l n="74">They mix 'd their joys and sorrows , hopes and fears ;</l>
     <l n="75">Each heart was anxious , till it could impart</l>
     <l n="76">Its daily feelings to its kindred heart ;</l>
     <l n="77">As years increased , unnumber 'd petty wars</l>
     <l n="78">Broke out between them ; jealousies and jars ;</l>
     <l n="79">Causeless indeed , and follow 'd by a peace ,</l>
     <l n="80">That gave to love — growth , vigour , and increase .</l>
     <l n="81">Whilst yet a boy , when other minds are void ,</l>
     <l n="82">Domestic thoughts young Alien 's hours employ 'd .</l>
     <l n="83">Judith in gaining hearts had no concern ,</l>
     <l n="84">Rather intent the matron 's part to learn ;</l>
     <l n="85">Thus early prudent and sedate they grew ,</l>
     <l n="86">While lovers , thoughtful — and though children , true .</l>
     <l n="87">To either parents not a day appeard ,</l>
     <l n="88">When with this love they might have interfered .</l>
     <l n="89">Childish at first , they cared not to restrain ;</l>
     <l n="90">And strong at last , they saw restriction vain ;</l>
     <l n="91">Nor knew they when that passion to reprove ,</l>
     <l n="92">Now idle fondness , now resistless love .</l>
     <l n="93">So while the waters rise , the children tread</l>
     <l n="94">On the broad estuary 's sandy bed ;</l>
     <l n="95">But soon the channel fills , from side to side</l>
     <l n="96">Comes danger rolling with the deep'ning tide ;</l>
     <l n="97">Yet none who saw the rapid current flow</l>
     <l n="98">Could the first instant of that danger know .</l>
     <l n="99">The lovers waited till the time should come</l>
     <l n="100">When they together could possess a home :</l>
     <l n="101">In either house were men and maids unwed ,</l>
     <l n="102">Hopes to be soothed , and tempers to be led .</l>
     <l n="103">Then Allen 's mother of his favourite maid</l>
     <l n="104">Spoke from the feelings of a mind afraid :</l>
     <l n="105">“ Dress and amusements were her sole employ , ”</l>
     <l n="106">She said — “ entangling her deluded boy ; ”</l>
     <l n="107">And yet , in truth , a mother 's jealous love</l>
     <l n="108">Had much imagined and could little prove ;</l>
     <l n="109">Judith had beauty — and if vain , was kind ,</l>
     <l n="110">Discreet and mild , and had a serious mind .</l>
     <l n="111">Dull was their prospect .— When the lovers met ,</l>
     <l n="112">They said , “ We must not — dare not venture yet . ”</l>
     <l n="113">“ Oh ! could I labour for thee , ” Allen cried ,</l>
     <l n="114">“ Why should our friends be thus dissatisfied ;</l>
     <l n="115">On my own arm I could depend , but they</l>
     <l n="116">Still urge obedience — must I yet obey ? ”</l>
     <l n="117">Poor Judith felt the grief , but grieving begg 'd delay .</l>
     <l n="118">At length a prospect came that seem 'd to smile ,</l>
     <l n="119">And faintly woo them , from a Western Isle ;</l>
     <l n="120">A kinsman there a widow 's hand had gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="121">“ Was old , was rich , and childless yet remain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="122">Would some young Booth to his affairs attend ,</l>
     <l n="123">And wait awhile , he might expect a friend . ”</l>
     <l n="124">The elder brothers , who were not in love ,</l>
     <l n="125">Fear 'd the false seas , unwilling to remove ;</l>
     <l n="126">But the young Allen , an enamour 'd boy ,</l>
     <l n="127">Eager an independence to enjoy ,</l>
     <l n="128">Would through all perils seek it ,— by the sea , -</l>
     <l n="129">Through labour , danger , pain , or slavery .</l>
     <l n="130">The faithful Judith his design approved ,</l>
     <l n="131">For both were sanguine , they were young , and loved .</l>
     <l n="132">The mother 's slow consent was then obtain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="133">The time arrived , to part alone remain 'd :</l>
     <l n="134">All things prepared , on the expected day</l>
     <l n="135">Was seen the vessel anchor 'd in the bay .</l>
     <l n="136">From her would seamen in the evening come ,</l>
     <l n="137">To take th ’ adventurous Allen from his home ;</l>
     <l n="138">With his own friends the final day he pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="139">And every painful hour , except the last .</l>
     <l n="140">The grieving father urged the cheerful glass ,</l>
     <l n="141">To make the moments with less sorrow pass ;</l>
     <l n="142">Intent the mother look 'd upon her son ,</l>
     <l n="143">And wish 'd th ’ assent withdrawn , the deed undone ;</l>
     <l n="144">The younger sister , as he took his way ,</l>
     <l n="145">Hung on his coat , and begg 'd for more delay :</l>
     <l n="146">But his own Judith call 'd him to the shore ,</l>
     <l n="147">Whom he must meet , for they might meet no more ; -</l>
     <l n="148">And there he found her — faithful , mournful , true ,</l>
     <l n="149">Weeping , and waiting for a last adieu !</l>
     <l n="150">The ebbing tide had left the sand , and there</l>
     <l n="151">Moved with slow steps the melancholy pair :</l>
     <l n="152">Sweet were the painful moments — but , how sweet ,</l>
     <l n="153">And without pain , when they again should meet !</l>
     <l n="154">Now either spoke as hope and fear impress 'd</l>
     <l n="155">Each their alternate triumph in the breast .</l>
     <l n="156">Distance alarm 'd the maid — she cried , “ ‘ Tis far ! ”</l>
     <l n="157">And danger too — “ it is a time of war :</l>
     <l n="158">Then in those countries are diseases strange ,</l>
     <l n="159">And women gay , and men are prone to change :</l>
     <l n="160">What then may happen in a year , when things</l>
     <l n="161">Of vast importance every moment brings !</l>
     <l n="162">But hark ! an oar ! ” she cried , yet none appear 'd -</l>
     <l n="163">‘ Twas love 's mistake , who fancied what it fear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="164">And she continued — “ Do , my Allen , keep</l>
     <l n="165">Thy heart from evil , let thy passions sleep ;</l>
     <l n="166">Believe it good , nay glorious , to prevail ,</l>
     <l n="167">And stand in safety where so many fail ;</l>
     <l n="168">And do not , Allen , or for shame , or pride ,</l>
     <l n="169">Thy faith abjure , or thy profession hide ;</l>
     <l n="170">Can I believe his love will lasting prove ,</l>
     <l n="171">Who has no rev'rence for the God I love ?</l>
     <l n="172">I know thee well ! how good thou art and kind ;</l>
     <l n="173">But strong the passions that invade thy mind -</l>
     <l n="174">Now , what to me hath Allen , to commend ? ”</l>
     <l n="175">“ Upon my mother , ” said the youth , ” attend ;</l>
     <l n="176">Forget her spleen , and , in my place appear ,</l>
     <l n="177">Her love to me will make my Judith dear ,</l>
     <l n="178">Oft I shall think ( such comforts lovers seek ) ,</l>
     <l n="179">Who speaks of me , and fancy what they speak ;</l>
     <l n="180">Then write on all occasions , always dwell</l>
     <l n="181">On hope 's fair prospects , and be kind and well ,</l>
     <l n="182">And ever choose the fondest , tenderest style . ”</l>
     <l n="183">She answer 'd , “ No , ” but answer 'd with a smile .</l>
     <l n="184">“ And now , my Judith , at so sad a time ,</l>
     <l n="185">Forgive my fear , and call it not my crime ;</l>
     <l n="186">When with our youthful neighbours ‘ tis thy chance</l>
     <l n="187">To meet in walks , the visit , or the dance ,</l>
     <l n="188">When every lad would on my lass attend ,</l>
     <l n="189">Choose not a smooth designer for a friend :</l>
     <l n="190">That fawning Philip !— nay , be not severe ,</l>
     <l n="191">A rival 's hope must cause a lover 's fear . ”</l>
     <l n="192">Displeased she felt , and might in her reply</l>
     <l n="193">Have mix 'd some anger , but the boat was nigh ,</l>
     <l n="194">Now truly heard !— it soon was full in sight ; -</l>
     <l n="195">Now the sad farewell , and the long good-night ;</l>
     <l n="196">For see !— his friends come hast'ning to the beach ,</l>
     <l n="197">And now the gunwale is within the reach :</l>
     <l n="198">“ Adieu !— farewell !— remember ! ” — and what more</l>
     <l n="199">Affection taught , was utter 'd from the shore .</l>
     <l n="200">But Judith left them with a heavy heart ,</l>
     <l n="201">Took a last view , and went to weep apart .</l>
     <l n="202">And now his friends went slowly from the place ,</l>
     <l n="203">Where she stood still , the dashing oar to trace ,</l>
     <l n="204">Till all were silent !— for the youth she pray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="205">And softly then return 'd the weeping maid .</l>
     <l n="206">They parted , thus by hope and fortune led ,</l>
     <l n="207">And Judith 's hours in pensive pleasure fled ;</l>
     <l n="208">But when return 'd the youth ?— the youth no more</l>
     <l n="209">Return 'd exulting to his native shore ;</l>
     <l n="210">But forty years were past , and then there came</l>
     <l n="211">A worn-out man with wither 'd limbs and lame ,</l>
     <l n="212">His mind oppress 'd with woes , and bent with age his frame .</l>
     <l n="213">Yes ! old and grieved , and trembling with decay ,</l>
     <l n="214">Was Allen landing in his native bay ,</l>
     <l n="215">Willing his breathless form should blend with kindred clay .</l>
     <l n="216">In an autumnal eve he left the beach ,</l>
     <l n="217">In such an eve he chanced the port to reach :</l>
     <l n="218">He was alone ; he press 'd the very place</l>
     <l n="219">Of the sad parting , of the last embrace :</l>
     <l n="220">There stood his parents , there retired the maid ,</l>
     <l n="221">So fond , so tender , and so much afraid ;</l>
     <l n="222">And on that spot , through many years , his mind</l>
     <l n="223">Turn 'd mournful back , half sinking , half resign 'd .</l>
     <l n="224">No one was present ; of its crew bereft ,</l>
     <l n="225">A single boat was in the billows left ;</l>
     <l n="226">Sent from some anchor 'd vessel in the bay ,</l>
     <l n="227">At the returning tide to sail away .</l>
     <l n="228">O'er the black stern the moonlight softly play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="229">The loosen 'd foresail flapping in the shade ;</l>
     <l n="230">All silent else on shore ; but from the town</l>
     <l n="231">A drowsy peal of distant bells came down :</l>
     <l n="232">From the tall houses here and there , a light</l>
     <l n="233">Served some confused remembrance to excite :</l>
     <l n="234">“ There , ” he observed , and new emotions felt ,</l>
     <l n="235">“ Was my first home — and yonder Judith dwelt ;</l>
     <l n="236">Dead ! dead are all ! I long — I fear to know , ”</l>
     <l n="237">He said , and walk 'd impatient , and yet slow .</l>
     <l n="238">Sudden there broke upon his grief a noise</l>
     <l n="239">Of merry tumult and of vulgar joys :</l>
     <l n="240">Seamen returning to their ship , were come ,</l>
     <l n="241">With idle numbers straying from their home ;</l>
     <l n="242">Allen among them mix 'd , and in the old</l>
     <l n="243">Strove some familiar features to behold ;</l>
     <l n="244">While fancy aided memory : — “ Man ! what cheer ? ”</l>
     <l n="245">A sailor cried ; “ Art thou at anchor here ? ”</l>
     <l n="246">Faintly he answer 'd , and then tried to trace</l>
     <l n="247">Some youthful features in some aged face :</l>
     <l n="248">A swarthy matron he beheld , and thought</l>
     <l n="249">She might unfold the very truths he sought :</l>
     <l n="250">Confused and trembling , he the dame address 'd :</l>
     <l n="251">“ The Booths ! yet live they ? ” pausing and oppress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="252">Then spake again : — “ Is there no ancient man ,</l>
     <l n="253">David his name ?— assist me , if you can . -</l>
     <l n="254">Flemings there were — and Judith , doth she live ? ”</l>
     <l n="255">The woman gazed , nor could an answer give , ’</l>
     <l n="256">Yet wond'ring stood , and all were silent by ,</l>
     <l n="257">Feeling a strange and solemn sympathy .</l>
     <l n="258">The woman musing said — “ She knew full well</l>
     <l n="259">Where the old people came at last to dwell ;</l>
     <l n="260">They had a married daughter , and a son ,</l>
     <l n="261">But they were dead , and now remain 'd not one . ”</l>
     <l n="262">“ Yes , ” said an elder , who had paused intent</l>
     <l n="263">On days long past , “ there was a sad event ; -</l>
     <l n="264">One of these Booths — it was my mother 's tale -</l>
     <l n="265">Here left his lass , I know not where to sail :</l>
     <l n="266">She saw their parting , and observed the pain ;</l>
     <l n="267">But never came th ’ unhappy man again : ”</l>
     <l n="268">“ The ship was captured ” — Allen meekly said ,</l>
     <l n="269">“ And what became of the forsaken maid ? ”</l>
     <l n="270">The woman answer 'd : “ I remember now ,</l>
     <l n="271">She used to tell the lasses of her vow ,</l>
     <l n="272">And of her lover 's loss , and I have seen</l>
     <l n="273">The gayest hearts grow sad where she bas been ;</l>
     <l n="274">Yet in her grief she married , and was made</l>
     <l n="275">Slave to a wretch , whom meekly she obey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="276">And early buried — but I know no more :</l>
     <l n="277">And hark ! our friends are hast'ning to the shore . ”</l>
     <l n="278">Allen soon found a lodging in the town ,</l>
     <l n="279">And walk 'd a man unnoticed up and down ,</l>
     <l n="280">This house , and this , he knew , and thought a face</l>
     <l n="281">He sometimes could among a number trace :</l>
     <l n="282">Of names remember 'd there remain 'd a few ,</l>
     <l n="283">But of no favourites , and the rest were new :</l>
     <l n="284">A merchant 's wealth , when Allen went to sea ,</l>
     <l n="285">Was reckon 'd boundless .— Could he living be ?</l>
     <l n="286">Or lived his son ? for one he had , the heir</l>
     <l n="287">To a vast business , and a fortune fair .</l>
     <l n="288">No ! but that heir 's poor widow , from her shed ,</l>
     <l n="289">With crutches went to take her dole of bread :</l>
     <l n="290">There was a friend whom he had left a boy ,</l>
     <l n="291">With hope to sail the master of a hoy ;</l>
     <l n="292">Him , after many a stormy day , he found</l>
     <l n="293">With his great wish , his life 's whole purpose , crown 'd .</l>
     <l n="294">This hoy 's proud captain look 'd in Allen 's face , -</l>
     <l n="295">“ Yours is , my friend , ” said he , “ a woeful case ;</l>
     <l n="296">We cannot all succeed : I now command</l>
     <l n="297">The Betsy sloop , and am not much at land :</l>
     <l n="298">But when we meet , you shall your story tell</l>
     <l n="299">Of foreign parts — I bid you now farewell ! ”</l>
     <l n="300">Allen so long had left his native shore ,</l>
     <l n="301">He saw but few whom he had seen before ;</l>
     <l n="302">The older people , as they met him , cast</l>
     <l n="303">A pitying look , oft speaking as they pass 'd -</l>
     <l n="304">“ The man is Allen Booth , and it appears</l>
     <l n="305">He dwelt among us in his early years :</l>
     <l n="306">We see the name engraved upon the stones ,</l>
     <l n="307">Where this poor wanderer means to lay his bones , ”</l>
     <l n="308">Thus where he lived and loved — unhappy change ! -</l>
     <l n="309">He seems a stranger , and finds all are strange .</l>
     <l n="310">But now a widow , in a village near ,</l>
     <l n="311">Chanced of the melancholy man to hear ;</l>
     <l n="312">Old as she was , to Judith 's bosom came</l>
     <l n="313">Some strong emotions at the well-known name ;</l>
     <l n="314">He was her much-loved Allen , she had stay 'd</l>
     <l n="315">Ten troubled years , a sad afflicted maid ;</l>
     <l n="316">Then was she wedded , of his death assured .</l>
     <l n="317">And much of mis'ry in her lot endured ;</l>
     <l n="318">Her husband died ; her children sought their bread</l>
     <l n="319">In various places , and to her were dead .</l>
     <l n="320">The once fond lovers met ; not grief nor age ,</l>
     <l n="321">Sickness nor pain , their hearts could disengage :</l>
     <l n="322">Each had immediate confidence ; a friend</l>
     <l n="323">Both now beheld , on whom they might depend :</l>
     <l n="324">“ Now is there one to whom I can express</l>
     <l n="325">My nature 's weakness , and my soul 's distress . ”</l>
     <l n="326">Allen look 'd up , and with impatient heart -</l>
     <l n="327">“ Let me not lose thee — never let us part :</l>
     <l n="328">So heaven this comfort to my sufferings give ,</l>
     <l n="329">It is not all distress to think and live . ”</l>
     <l n="330">Thus Allen spoke — for time had not removed</l>
     <l n="331">The charms attach 'd to one so fondly loved ;</l>
     <l n="332">Who with more health , the mistress of their cot ,</l>
     <l n="333">Labours to soothe the evils of his lot .</l>
     <l n="334">To her , to her alone , his various fate ,</l>
     <l n="335">At various times , ‘ tis comfort to relate ;</l>
     <l n="336">And yet his sorrow — she too loves to hear</l>
     <l n="337">What wrings her bosom , and compels the tear .</l>
     <l n="338">First he related how he left the shore ,</l>
     <l n="339">Alarm 'd with fears that they should meet no more .</l>
     <l n="340">Then , ere the ship had reach 'd her purposed course ,</l>
     <l n="341">They met and yielded to the Spanish force ;</l>
     <l n="342">Then ‘ cross th ’ Atlantic seas they bore their prey ,</l>
     <l n="343">Who grieving landed from their sultry bay :</l>
     <l n="344">And marching many a burning league , he found</l>
     <l n="345">Himself a slave upon a miner 's ground :</l>
     <l n="346">There a good priest his native language spoke ,</l>
     <l n="347">And gave some ease to his tormenting yoke ;</l>
     <l n="348">Kindly advanced him in his master 's grace ,</l>
     <l n="349">And he was station 'd in an easier place ;</l>
     <l n="350">There , hopeless ever to escape the land ,</l>
     <l n="351">He to a Spanish maiden gave his hand ;</l>
     <l n="352">In cottage shelter 'd from the blaze of day ,</l>
     <l n="353">He saw his happy infants round him play ;</l>
     <l n="354">Where summer shadows , made by lofty trees ,</l>
     <l n="355">Waved o'er his seat , and soothed his reveries ;</l>
     <l n="356">E'en then he thought of England , nor could sigh ,</l>
     <l n="357">But his fond Isabel demanded , “ Why ? ”</l>
     <l n="358">Grieved by the story , she the sigh repaid ,</l>
     <l n="359">And wept in pity for the English maid :</l>
     <l n="360">Thus twenty years were pass d , and pass 'd his views</l>
     <l n="361">Of further bliss , for he had wealth to lose :</l>
     <l n="362">His friend now dead , some foe had dared to paint</l>
     <l n="363">“ His faith as tainted : he his spouse would taint ;</l>
     <l n="364">Make all his children infidels , and found</l>
     <l n="365">An English heresy on Christian ground . ”</l>
     <l n="366">“ Whilst I was poor , ” said Allen , “ none would care</l>
     <l n="367">What my poor notions of religion were ;</l>
     <l n="368">None ask 'd me whom I worshipp 'd , how I pray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="369">If due obedience to the laws were paid :</l>
     <l n="370">My good adviser taught me to be still ,</l>
     <l n="371">Nor to make converts had I power or will .</l>
     <l n="372">I preach 'd no foreign doctrine to my wife ,</l>
     <l n="373">And never mention 'd Luther in my life ;</l>
     <l n="374">I , all they said , say what they would , allow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="375">And when the fathers bade me bow , I bow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="376">Their forms I follow 'd , whether well or sick ,</l>
     <l n="377">And was a most obedient Catholic .</l>
     <l n="378">But I had money , and these pastors found</l>
     <l n="379">My notions vague , heretical , unsound :</l>
     <l n="380">A wicked book they seized ; the very Turk</l>
     <l n="381">Could not have read a more pernicious work ;</l>
     <l n="382">To me pernicious , who if it were good</l>
     <l n="383">Or evil question 'd not , nor understood :</l>
     <l n="384">Oh ! had I little but the book possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="385">I might have read it , and enjoy 'd my rest . ”</l>
     <l n="386">Alas ! poor Allen — through his wealth was seen</l>
     <l n="387">Crimes that by poverty conceal 'd had been :</l>
     <l n="388">Faults that in dusty pictures rest unknown ,</l>
     <l n="389">Are in an instant through the varnish shown .</l>
     <l n="390">He told their cruel mercy ; how at last ,</l>
     <l n="391">In Christian kindness for the merits past ,</l>
     <l n="392">They spared his forfeit life , but bade him fly ,</l>
     <l n="393">Or for his crime and contumacy die ;</l>
     <l n="394">Fly from all scenes , all objects of delight :</l>
     <l n="395">His wife , his children , weeping in his sight ,</l>
     <l n="396">All urging him to flee , he fled , and cursed his flight .</l>
     <l n="397">He next related how he found a way ,</l>
     <l n="398">Guideless and grieving , to Campeachy-Bay :</l>
     <l n="399">There in the woods he wrought , and there , among</l>
     <l n="400">Some lab'ring seamen , heard his native tongue :</l>
     <l n="401">The sound , one moment , broke upon his pain</l>
     <l n="402">With joyful force ; he long 'd to hear again :</l>
     <l n="403">Again he heard ; he seized an offer 'd hand ,</l>
     <l n="404">“ And when beheld you last our native land ! ”</l>
     <l n="405">He cried , “ and in what country ? quickly say . ”</l>
     <l n="406">The seamen answer 'd — strangers all were they ;</l>
     <l n="407">Only one at his native port had been ;</l>
     <l n="408">He , landing once , the quay and church had seen ,</l>
     <l n="409">For that esteem 'd ; but nothing more he knew .</l>
     <l n="410">Still more to know , would Allen join the crew ,</l>
     <l n="411">Sail where they sail 'd , and , many a peril past ,</l>
     <l n="412">They at his kinsman 's isle their anchor cast ;</l>
     <l n="413">But him they found not , nor could one relate</l>
     <l n="414">Aught of his will , his wish , or his estate .</l>
     <l n="415">This grieved not Allen ; then again he sail 'd</l>
     <l n="416">For England 's coast , again his fate prevailed :</l>
     <l n="417">War raged , and he , an active man and strong ,</l>
     <l n="418">Was soon impress 'd , and served his country long .</l>
     <l n="419">By various shores he pass 'd , on various seas ,</l>
     <l n="420">Never so happy as when void of ease . -</l>
     <l n="421">And then he told how in a calm distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="422">Day after day his soul was sick of rest ;</l>
     <l n="423">When , as a log upon the deep they stood ,</l>
     <l n="424">Then roved his spirit to the inland wood ;</l>
     <l n="425">Till , while awake , he dream 'd , that on the seas</l>
     <l n="426">Were his loved home , the hill , the stream , the trees :</l>
     <l n="427">He gazed , he pointed to the scenes : — “ There stand</l>
     <l n="428">My wife , my children , ‘ tis my lovely land .</l>
     <l n="429">See ! there my dwelling — oh ! delicious scene</l>
     <l n="430">Of my best life : — unhand me — are ye men ? ”</l>
     <l n="431">And thus the frenzy ruled him , till the wind</l>
     <l n="432">Brush 'd the fond pictures from the stagnant mind .</l>
     <l n="433">He told of bloody fights , and how at length</l>
     <l n="434">The rage of battle gave his spirits strength :</l>
     <l n="435">‘ Twas in the Indian seas his limb he lost ,</l>
     <l n="436">And he was left half-dead upon the coast ;</l>
     <l n="437">But living gain 'd , ‘ mid rich aspiring men ,</l>
     <l n="438">A fair subsistence by his ready pen .</l>
     <l n="439">“ Thus , ” he continued , “ pass 'd unvaried years ,</l>
     <l n="440">Without events producing hopes or fears . ”</l>
     <l n="441">Augmented pay procured him decent wealth ,</l>
     <l n="442">But years advancing undermined his health ;</l>
     <l n="443">Then oft-times in delightful dream he flew</l>
     <l n="444">To England 's shore , and scenes his childhood knew :</l>
     <l n="445">He saw his parents , saw his fav'rite maid ,</l>
     <l n="446">No feature wrinkled , not a charm decay 'd ;</l>
     <l n="447">And thus excited , in his bosom rose</l>
     <l n="448">A wish so strong , it baffled his repose :</l>
     <l n="449">Anxious he felt on English earth to lie ;</l>
     <l n="450">To view his native soil , and there to die .</l>
     <l n="451">He then described the gloom , the dread he found ,</l>
     <l n="452">When first he landed on the chosen ground ,</l>
     <l n="453">Where undefined was all he hoped and fear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="454">And how confused and troubled all appear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="455">His thoughts in past and present scenes employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="456">All views in future blighted and destroy 'd :</l>
     <l n="457">His were a medley of be wild'ring themes ,</l>
     <l n="458">Sad as realities , and wild as dreams .</l>
     <l n="459">Here his relation closes , but his mind</l>
     <l n="460">Flies back again some resting-place to find ;</l>
     <l n="461">Thus silent , musing through the day , he sees</l>
     <l n="462">His children sporting by those lofty trees ,</l>
     <l n="463">Their mother singing in the shady scene ,</l>
     <l n="464">Where the fresh springs burst o'er the lively green ; -</l>
     <l n="465">So strong his eager fancy , he affrights</l>
     <l n="466">The faithful widow by its powerful flights ;</l>
     <l n="467">For what disturbs him he aloud will tell ,</l>
     <l n="468">And cry — “ ‘ Tis she , my wife ! my Isabel !</l>
     <l n="469">Where are my children ? ” — Judith grieves to hear</l>
     <l n="470">How the soul works in sorrows so severe ;</l>
     <l n="471">Assiduous all his wishes to attend ,</l>
     <l n="472">Deprived of much , he yet may boast a friend ;</l>
     <l n="473">Watch 'd by her care , in sleep , his spirit takes</l>
     <l n="474">Its flight , and watchful finds her when he wakes .</l>
     <l n="475">‘ Tis now her office ; her attention see !</l>
     <l n="476">While her friend sleeps beneath that shading tree ,</l>
     <l n="477">Careful , she guards him from the glowing heat ,</l>
     <l n="478">And pensive muses at her Allen 's feet .</l>
     <l n="479">And where is he ? Ah ! doubtless in those scenes</l>
     <l n="480">Of his best days , amid the vivid greens .</l>
     <l n="481">Fresh with unnumber 'd rills , where ev'ry gale</l>
     <l n="482">Breathes the rich fragrance of the neighb'ring vale .</l>
     <l n="483">Smiles not his wife , and listens as there comes</l>
     <l n="484">The night-bird 's music from the thick'ning glooms ?</l>
     <l n="485">And as he sits with all these treasures nigh ,</l>
     <l n="486">Blaze not with fairy-light the phosphor-fly ,</l>
     <l n="487">When like a sparkling gem it wheels illumined by ?</l>
     <l n="488">This is the joy that now so plainly speaks</l>
     <l n="489">In the warm transient flushing of his cheeks ;</l>
     <l n="490">For he is list'ning to the fancied noise</l>
     <l n="491">Of his own children , eager in their joys :</l>
     <l n="492">All this he feels , a dream 's delusive bliss</l>
     <l n="493">Gives the expression , and the glow like this .</l>
     <l n="494">And now his Judith lays her knitting by ,</l>
     <l n="495">These strong emotions in her friend to spy</l>
     <l n="496">For she can fully of their nature deem -</l>
     <l n="497">But see ! he breaks the long protracted theme ,</l>
     <l n="498">And wakes , and cries — “ My God ! ‘ twas but a dream . ”</l>

     <l n="5">Henry VIII .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="6">Gwyn was a farmer , whom the farmers all ,</l>
     <l n="7">Who dwelt around , “ the Gentleman ” would call ;</l>
     <l n="8">Whether in pure humility or pride ,</l>
     <l n="9">They only knew , and they would not decide .</l>
     <l n="10">Far different he from that dull plodding tribe</l>
     <l n="11">Whom it was his amusement to describe ;</l>
     <l n="12">Creatures no more enliven 'd than a clod ,</l>
     <l n="13">But treading still as their dull fathers trod ;</l>
     <l n="14">Who lived in times when not a man had seen</l>
     <l n="15">Corn sown by drill , or thresh 'd by a machine !</l>
     <l n="16">He was of those whose skill assigns the prize</l>
     <l n="17">For creatures fed in pens , and stalls , and sties ;</l>
     <l n="18">And who , in places where improvers meet ,</l>
     <l n="19">To fill the land with fatness , had a seat ;</l>
     <l n="20">Who in large mansions live like petty kings ,</l>
     <l n="21">And speak of farms but as amusing things ;</l>
     <l n="22">Who plans encourage , and who journals keep ,</l>
     <l n="23">And talk with lords about a breed of sheep .</l>
     <l n="24">Two are the species in this genus known ;</l>
     <l n="25">One , who is rich in his profession grown ,</l>
     <l n="26">Who yearly finds his ample stores increase ,</l>
     <l n="27">From fortune 's favours and a favouring lease ;</l>
     <l n="28">Who rides his hunter , who his house adorns ;</l>
     <l n="29">Who drinks his wine , and his disbursements scorns ;</l>
     <l n="30">Who freely lives , and loves to show he can , -</l>
     <l n="31">This is the Farmer made the Gentleman .</l>
     <l n="32">The second species from the world is sent ,</l>
     <l n="33">Tired with its strife , or with his wealth content ;</l>
     <l n="34">In books and men beyond the former read</l>
     <l n="35">To farming solely by a passion led ,</l>
     <l n="36">Or by a fashion ; curious in his land ;</l>
     <l n="37">Now planning much , now changing what he plann 'd ;</l>
     <l n="38">Pleased by each trial , not by failures vex 'd ,</l>
     <l n="39">And ever certain to succeed the next ;</l>
     <l n="40">Quick to resolve , and easy to persuade , -</l>
     <l n="41">This is the Gentleman , a farmer made .</l>
     <l n="42">Gwyn was of these ; he from the world withdrew</l>
     <l n="43">Early in life , his reasons known to few ;</l>
     <l n="44">Some disappointments said , some pure good sense ,</l>
     <l n="45">The love of land , the press of indolence ;</l>
     <l n="46">His fortune known , and coming to retire ,</l>
     <l n="47">If not a Farmer , men had call 'd him ‘ Squire .</l>
     <l n="48">Forty and five his years , no child or wife</l>
     <l n="49">Cross 'd the still tenour of his chosen life ;</l>
     <l n="50">Much land he purchased , planted far around ,</l>
     <l n="51">And let some portions of superfluous ground</l>
     <l n="52">To farmers near him , not displeased to say</l>
     <l n="53">“ My tenants , ” nor “ our worthy landlord , ” they .</l>
     <l n="54">Fix 'd in his farm , he soon display 'd his skill</l>
     <l n="55">In small-boned lambs , the horse-hoe , and the drill ;</l>
     <l n="56">From these he rose to themes of nobler kind ,</l>
     <l n="57">And show 'd the riches of a fertile mind ;</l>
     <l n="58">To all around their visits he repaid</l>
     <l n="59">And thus his mansion and himself display 'd .</l>
     <l n="60">His rooms were stately , rather fine than neat ,</l>
     <l n="61">And guests politely call 'd his house a Seat ;</l>
     <l n="62">At much expense was each apartment graced ,</l>
     <l n="63">His taste was gorgeous , but it still was taste ;</l>
     <l n="64">In full festoons the crimson curtains fell ,</l>
     <l n="65">The sofas rose in bold elastic swell ;</l>
     <l n="66">Mirrors in gilded frames display 'd the tints</l>
     <l n="67">Of glowing carpets and of colour 'd prints :</l>
     <l n="68">The weary eye saw every object shine ,</l>
     <l n="69">And all was costly , fanciful , and fine .</l>
     <l n="70">As with his friends he pass 'd the social hours ,</l>
     <l n="71">His generous spirit scorn 'd to hide its powers ;</l>
     <l n="72">Powers unexpected , for his eye and air</l>
     <l n="73">Gave no sure signs that eloquence was there ;</l>
     <l n="74">Oft he began with sudden fire and force ,</l>
     <l n="75">As loth to lose occasion for discourse ;</l>
     <l n="76">Some , ‘ tis observed , who feel a wish to speak ,</l>
     <l n="77">Will a due place for introduction seek ;</l>
     <l n="78">On to their purpose step by step they steal ,</l>
     <l n="79">And all their way , by certain signals , feel ;</l>
     <l n="80">Others plunge in at once , and never heed</l>
     <l n="81">Whose turn they take , whose purpose they impede ;</l>
     <l n="82">Resolved to shine , they hasten to begin ,</l>
     <l n="83">Of ending thoughtless — and of these was Gwyn .</l>
     <l n="84">And thus he spake : -</l>
     <l n="85">“ It grieves me to the soul ,</l>
     <l n="86">To see how man submits to man 's control ;</l>
     <l n="87">How overpower 'd and shackled minds are led</l>
     <l n="88">In vulgar tracks , and to submission bred ;</l>
     <l n="89">The coward never on himself relies ,</l>
     <l n="90">But to an equal for assistance flies ;</l>
     <l n="91">Man yields to custom , as he bows to fate ,</l>
     <l n="92">In all things ruled — mind , body , and estate ;</l>
     <l n="93">In pain , in sickness , we for cure apply</l>
     <l n="94">To them we know not , and we know not why ;</l>
     <l n="95">But that the creature has some jargon read ,</l>
     <l n="96">And got some Scotchman 's system in his head ;</l>
     <l n="97">Some grave impostor , who will health ensure ,</l>
     <l n="98">Long as your patience or your wealth endure ,</l>
     <l n="99">But mark them well , the pale and sickly crew ,</l>
     <l n="100">They have not health , and can they give it you ?</l>
     <l n="101">These solemn cheats their various methods choose ,</l>
     <l n="102">A system fires them , as a bard his muse :</l>
     <l n="103">Hence wordy wars arise ; the learn 'd divide ,</l>
     <l n="104">And groaning patients curse each erring guide .</l>
     <l n="105">“ Next , our affairs are govern 'd , buy or sell ,</l>
     <l n="106">Upon the deed the law must fix its spell ;</l>
     <l n="107">Whether we hire or let , we must have still</l>
     <l n="108">The dubious aid of an attorney 's skill ;</l>
     <l n="109">They take a part in every man 's affairs ,</l>
     <l n="110">And in all business some concern is theirs ;</l>
     <l n="111">Because mankind in ways prescribed are found</l>
     <l n="112">Like flocks that follow on a beaten ground .</l>
     <l n="113">Each abject nature in the way proceeds ,</l>
     <l n="114">That now to shearing , now to slaughter leads .</l>
     <l n="115">Should you offend , though meaning no offence ,</l>
     <l n="116">You have no safety in your innocence ;</l>
     <l n="117">The statute broken then is placed in view ,</l>
     <l n="118">And men must pay for crimes they never knew ;</l>
     <l n="119">Who would by law regain his plunder 'd store ,</l>
     <l n="120">Would pick up fallen merc'ry from the floor ;</l>
     <l n="121">If he pursue it , here and there it slides ,</l>
     <l n="122">He would collect it , but it more divides ;</l>
     <l n="123">This part and this he stops , but still in vain ,</l>
     <l n="124">It slips aside , and breaks in parts again ;</l>
     <l n="125">Till , after time and pains , and care and cost ,</l>
     <l n="126">He finds his labour and his object lost .</l>
     <l n="127">But most it grieves me ( friends alone are round ) ,</l>
     <l n="128">To see a man in priestly fetters bound ;</l>
     <l n="129">Guides to the soul , these friends of Heaven contrive ,</l>
     <l n="130">Long as man lives , to keep his fears alive :</l>
     <l n="131">Soon as an infant breathes , their rites begin ;</l>
     <l n="132">Who knows not sinning , must be freed from sin ;</l>
     <l n="133">Who needs no bond , must yet engage in vows ;</l>
     <l n="134">Who has no judgment , must a creed espouse :</l>
     <l n="135">Advanced in life , our boys are bound by rules ,</l>
     <l n="136">Are catechised in churches , cloisters , schools ,</l>
     <l n="137">And train 'd in thraldom to be fit for tools :</l>
     <l n="138">The youth grown up , he now a partner needs ,</l>
     <l n="139">And lo ! a priest , as soon as he succeeds .</l>
     <l n="140">What man of sense can marriage-rites approve ?</l>
     <l n="141">What man of spirit can be bound to love ?</l>
     <l n="142">Forced to be kind ! compell 'd to be sincere !</l>
     <l n="143">Do chains and fetters make companions dear ?</l>
     <l n="144">Pris'ners indeed we bind ; but though the bond</l>
     <l n="145">May keep them safe , it does not make them fond :</l>
     <l n="146">The ring , the vow , the witness , licence , prayers ,</l>
     <l n="147">All parties known ! made public all affairs !</l>
     <l n="148">Such forms men suffer , and from these they date</l>
     <l n="149">A deed of love begun with all they hate :</l>
     <l n="150">Absurd ! that none the beaten road should shun ,</l>
     <l n="151">But love to do what other dupes have done .</l>
     <l n="152">“ Well , now your priest has made you one of twain ,</l>
     <l n="153">Look you for rest ? Alas ! you look in vain .</l>
     <l n="154">If sick , he comes ; you cannot die in peace ,</l>
     <l n="155">Till he attends to witness your release ;</l>
     <l n="156">To vex your soul , and urge you to confess</l>
     <l n="157">The sins you feel , remember , or can guess ;</l>
     <l n="158">Nay , when departed , to your grave he goes -</l>
     <l n="159">But there indeed he hurts not your repose .</l>
     <l n="160">“ Such are our burthens ; part we must sustain ,</l>
     <l n="161">But need not link new grievance to the chain :</l>
     <l n="162">Yet men like idiots will their frames surround</l>
     <l n="163">With these vile shackles , nor confess they 're bound ;</l>
     <l n="164">In all that most confines them they confide ,</l>
     <l n="165">Their slavery boast , and make their bonds their pride ;</l>
     <l n="166">E'en as the pressure galls them , they declare</l>
     <l n="167">( Good souls ! ) how happy and how free they are !</l>
     <l n="168">As madmen , pointing round their wretched cells ,</l>
     <l n="169">Cry , ‘ Lo ! the palace where our honour dwells . ’</l>
     <l n="170">“ Such is our state : but I resolve to live</l>
     <l n="171">By rules my reason and my feelings give ;</l>
     <l n="172">No legal guards shall keep enthrall 'd my mind ,</l>
     <l n="173">No Slaves command me , and no teachers blind .</l>
     <l n="174">Tempted by sins , let me their strength defy ,</l>
     <l n="175">But have no second in a surplice by ;</l>
     <l n="176">No bottle-holder , with officious aid ,</l>
     <l n="177">To comfort conscience , weaken 'd and afraid :</l>
     <l n="178">Then if I yield , my frailty is not known ;</l>
     <l n="179">And , if I stand , the glory is my own .</l>
     <l n="180">“ When Truth and Reason are our friends , we seem</l>
     <l n="181">Alive ! awake !— the superstitious dream .</l>
     <l n="182">Oh ! then , fair truth , for thee alone I seek ,</l>
     <l n="183">Friend to the wise , supporter of the weak ;</l>
     <l n="184">From thee we learn whate'er is right and just :</l>
     <l n="185">Forms to despise , professions to distrust ;</l>
     <l n="186">Creeds to reject , pretensions to deride ,</l>
     <l n="187">And , following thee , to follow none beside . ”</l>
     <l n="188">Such was the speech : it struck upon the ear</l>
     <l n="189">Like sudden thunder none expect to hear .</l>
     <l n="190">He saw men 's wonder with a manly pride ,</l>
     <l n="191">And gravely smiled at guest electrified .</l>
     <l n="192">“ A farmer this ! ” they said , “ Oh ! let him seek</l>
     <l n="193">That place where he may for his country speak ;</l>
     <l n="194">On some great question to harangue for hours ,</l>
     <l n="195">While speakers , hearing , envy nobler powers ! ”</l>
     <l n="196">Wisdom like this , as all things rich and rare ,</l>
     <l n="197">Must be acquired with pains , and kept with care ;</l>
     <l n="198">In books he sought it , which his friends might view ,</l>
     <l n="199">When their kind host the guarding curtain drew .</l>
     <l n="200">There were historic works for graver hours ,</l>
     <l n="201">And lighter verse to spur the languid powers ;</l>
     <l n="202">There metaphysics , logic there had place ;</l>
     <l n="203">But of devotion not a single trace -</l>
     <l n="204">Save what is taught in Gibbon 's florid page ,</l>
     <l n="205">And other guides of this inquiring age .</l>
     <l n="206">There Hume appear 'd , and near a splendid book</l>
     <l n="207">Composed by Gay 's “ good lord of Bolingbroke : ”</l>
     <l n="208">With these were mix 'd the light , the free , the vain ,</l>
     <l n="209">And from a corner peep 'd the sage Tom Paine ;</l>
     <l n="210">Here four neat volumes Chesterfield were named ,</l>
     <l n="211">For manners much and easy morals famed ;</l>
     <l n="212">With chaste Memoirs of females , to be read</l>
     <l n="213">When deeper studies had confused the head .</l>
     <l n="214">Such his resources , treasures where he sought</l>
     <l n="215">For daily knowledge till his mind was fraught :</l>
     <l n="216">Then , when his friends were present , for their use</l>
     <l n="217">He would the riches he had stored produce ;</l>
     <l n="218">He found his lamp burn clearer when each day</l>
     <l n="219">He drew for all he purposed to display ;</l>
     <l n="220">For these occasions forth his knowledge sprung ,</l>
     <l n="221">As mustard quickens on a bed of dung :</l>
     <l n="222">All was prepared , and guests allow 'd the praise</l>
     <l n="223">For what they saw he could so quickly raise .</l>
     <l n="224">Such this new friend ; and when the year came round ,</l>
     <l n="225">The same impressive , reasoning sage was found :</l>
     <l n="226">Then , too , was seen the pleasant mansion graced</l>
     <l n="227">With a fair damsel — his no vulgar taste ;</l>
     <l n="228">The neat Rebecca — sly , observant , still ,</l>
     <l n="229">Watching his eye , and waiting on his will ;</l>
     <l n="230">Simple yet smart her dress , her manners meek ,</l>
     <l n="231">Her smiles spoke for her , she would seldom speak :</l>
     <l n="232">But watch 'd each look , each meaning to detect ,</l>
     <l n="233">And ( pleased with notice ) felt for all neglect .</l>
     <l n="234">With her lived Gwyn a sweet harmonious life ,</l>
     <l n="235">Who , forms excepted , was a charming wife :</l>
     <l n="236">The wives indeed , so made by vulgar law ,</l>
     <l n="237">Affected scorn , and censured what they saw ,</l>
     <l n="238">And what they saw not , fancied ; said ‘ twas sin ,</l>
     <l n="239">And took no notice of the wife of Gwyn :</l>
     <l n="240">But he despised their rudeness , and would prove</l>
     <l n="241">Theirs was compulsion and distrust , not love ;</l>
     <l n="242">“ Fools as they were ! could they conceive that rings</l>
     <l n="243">And parsons ’ blessings were substantial things ? ”</l>
     <l n="244">They answer 'd “ Yes ; ” while he contemptuous spoke</l>
     <l n="245">Of the low notions held by simple folk ;</l>
     <l n="246">Yet , strange that anger in a man so wise</l>
     <l n="247">Should from the notions of these fools arise ;</l>
     <l n="248">Can they so vex us , whom we so despise ?</l>
     <l n="249">Brave as he was , our hero felt a dread</l>
     <l n="250">Lest those who saw him kind should think him led ;</l>
     <l n="251">If to his bosom fear a visit paid ,</l>
     <l n="252">It was , lest he should be supposed afraid :</l>
     <l n="253">Hence sprang his orders ; not that he desired</l>
     <l n="254">The things when done : obedience he required ;</l>
     <l n="255">And thus , to prove his absolute command ,</l>
     <l n="256">Ruled every heart , and moved each subject hand ;</l>
     <l n="257">Assent he ask 'd for every word and whim ,</l>
     <l n="258">To prove that he alone was king of him .</l>
     <l n="259">The still Rebecca , who her station knew ,</l>
     <l n="260">With ease resign 'd the honours not her due :</l>
     <l n="261">Well pleased she saw that men her board would grace ,</l>
     <l n="262">And wish 'd not there to see a female face ;</l>
     <l n="263">When by her lover she his spouse was styled ,</l>
     <l n="264">Polite she thought it , and demurely smiled ;</l>
     <l n="265">But when he wanted wives and maidens round</l>
     <l n="266">So to regard her , she grew grave and frown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="267">And sometimes whisper 'd — “ Why should you respect</l>
     <l n="268">These people 's notions , yet their forms reject ? ”</l>
     <l n="269">Gwyn , though from marriage bond and fetter free ,</l>
     <l n="270">Still felt abridgment in his liberty ;</l>
     <l n="271">Something of hesitation he betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="272">And in her presence thought of what he said .</l>
     <l n="273">Thus fair Rebecca , though she walk 'd astray ,</l>
     <l n="274">His creed rejecting , judged it right to pray ,</l>
     <l n="275">To be at church , to sit with serious looks ,</l>
     <l n="276">To read her Bible and her Sunday-books :</l>
     <l n="277">She hated all those new and daring themes ,</l>
     <l n="278">And call 'd his free conjectures “ devil 's dreams : ”</l>
     <l n="279">She honour 'd still the priesthood in her fall ,</l>
     <l n="280">And claim 'd respect and reverence for them all ;</l>
     <l n="281">Call 'd them “ of sin 's destructive power the foes ,</l>
     <l n="282">And not such blockheads as he might suppose . ”</l>
     <l n="283">Gwyn to his friends would smile , and sometimes say ,</l>
     <l n="284">“ ‘ Tis a kind fool ; why vex her in her way ? ”</l>
     <l n="285">Her way she took , and still had more in view ,</l>
     <l n="286">For she contrived that he should take it too .</l>
     <l n="287">The daring freedom of his soul , ‘ twas plain ,</l>
     <l n="288">In part was lost in a divided reign ;</l>
     <l n="289">A king and queen , who yet in prudence sway 'd</l>
     <l n="290">Their peaceful state , and were in turn obey 'd .</l>
     <l n="291">Yet such our fate , that when we plan the best ,</l>
     <l n="292">Something arises to disturb our rest :</l>
     <l n="293">For though in spirits high , in body strong ,</l>
     <l n="294">Gwyn something felt — he knew not what — was wrong ,</l>
     <l n="295">He wish 'd to know , for he believed the thing ,</l>
     <l n="296">If unremoved , would other evil bring :</l>
     <l n="297">“ She must perceive , of late he could not eat ,</l>
     <l n="298">And when he walk 'd he trembled on his feet :</l>
     <l n="299">He had forebodings , and he seem 'd as one</l>
     <l n="300">Stopp 'd on the road , or threaten 'd by a dun ;</l>
     <l n="301">He could not live , and yet , should he apply</l>
     <l n="302">To those physicians — he must sooner die . ”</l>
     <l n="303">The mild Rebecca heard with some disdain ,</l>
     <l n="304">And some distress , her friend and lord complain :</l>
     <l n="305">His death she fear 'd not , but had painful doubt</l>
     <l n="306">What his distemper 'd nerves might bring about ;</l>
     <l n="307">With power like hers she dreaded an ally ,</l>
     <l n="308">And yet there was a person in her eye ; -</l>
     <l n="309">She thought , debated , fix 'd — “ Alas ! ” she said ,</l>
     <l n="310">“ A case like yours must be no more delay 'd ;</l>
     <l n="311">You hate these doctors ; well ! but were a friend</l>
     <l n="312">And doctor one , your fears would have an end :</l>
     <l n="313">My cousin Mollet — Scotland holds him now -</l>
     <l n="314">Is above all men skilful , all allow ;</l>
     <l n="315">Of late a Doctor , and within a while</l>
     <l n="316">He means to settle in this favoured isle :</l>
     <l n="317">Should he attend you , with his skill profound ,</l>
     <l n="318">You must be safe , and shortly would be sound . ”</l>
     <l n="319">When men in health against Physicians rail ,</l>
     <l n="320">They should consider that their nerves may fail ;</l>
     <l n="321">Who calls a Lawyer rogue , may find , too late ,</l>
     <l n="322">On one of these depends his whole estate ;</l>
     <l n="323">Nay , when the world can nothing more produce ,</l>
     <l n="324">The Priest , th ’ insulted priest , may have his use ;</l>
     <l n="325">Ease , health , and comfort lift a man so high ,</l>
     <l n="326">These powers are dwarfs that he can scarcely spy ;</l>
     <l n="327">Pain , sickness , langour , keep a man so low ,</l>
     <l n="328">That these neglected dwarfs to giants grow :</l>
     <l n="329">Happy is he who through the medium sees</l>
     <l n="330">Of clear good sense — but Gwyn was not of these .</l>
     <l n="331">He heard and he rejoiced : “ Ah ! let him come ,</l>
     <l n="332">And till he fixes , make my house his home . ”</l>
     <l n="333">Home came the Doctor — he was much admired ;</l>
     <l n="334">He told the patient what his case required ;</l>
     <l n="335">His hours for sleep , his time to eat and drink ,</l>
     <l n="336">When he should ride , read , rest , compose , or think .</l>
     <l n="337">Thus join 'd peculiar skill and art profound ,</l>
     <l n="338">To make the fancy-sick no more than fancy-sound .</l>
     <l n="339">With such attention , who could long be ill ?</l>
     <l n="340">Returning health proclaim 'd the Doctor 's skill .</l>
     <l n="341">Presents and praises from a grateful heart</l>
     <l n="342">Were freely offer 'd on the patient 's part ;</l>
     <l n="343">In high repute the Doctor seem 'd to stand ,</l>
     <l n="344">But still had got no footing in the land ;</l>
     <l n="345">And , as he saw the seat was rich and fair ,</l>
     <l n="346">He felt disposed to fix his station there :</l>
     <l n="347">To gain his purpose he perform 'd the part</l>
     <l n="348">Of a good actor , and prepared to start ;</l>
     <l n="349">Not like a traveller in a day serene ,</l>
     <l n="350">When the sun shone and when the roads were clean ;</l>
     <l n="351">Not like the pilgrim , when the morning gray ,</l>
     <l n="352">The ruddy eve succeeding , sends his way ;</l>
     <l n="353">But in a season when the sharp east wind</l>
     <l n="354">Had all its influence on a nervous mind ;</l>
     <l n="355">When past the parlour 's front it fiercely blew ,</l>
     <l n="356">And Gwyn sat pitying every bird that flew ,</l>
     <l n="357">This strange physician said — “ Adieu ! Adieu !</l>
     <l n="358">Farewell !— Heaven bless you !— if you should — but no ,</l>
     <l n="359">You need not fear — farewell ! ‘ tis time to go . ”</l>
     <l n="360">The Doctor spoke ; and as the patient heard ,</l>
     <l n="361">His old disorders ( dreadful train ! ) appear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="362">“ He felt the tingling tremor , and the stress</l>
     <l n="363">Upon his nerves that he could not express ;</l>
     <l n="364">Should his good friend forsake him , he perhaps</l>
     <l n="365">Might meet his death , and surely a relapse . ”</l>
     <l n="366">So , as the Doctor seem 'd intent to part ,</l>
     <l n="367">He cried in terror — “ Oh ! be where thou art :</l>
     <l n="368">Come , thou art young , and unengaged ; oh ! come ,</l>
     <l n="369">Make me thy friend , give comfort to mine home ;</l>
     <l n="370">I have now symptoms that require thine aid ,</l>
     <l n="371">Do , Doctor , stay : ” — th ’ obliging Doctor stay 'd .</l>
     <l n="372">Thus Gwyn was happy ; he had now a friend ,</l>
     <l n="373">And a meek spouse on whom he could depend :</l>
     <l n="374">But now possess 'd of male and female guide ,</l>
     <l n="375">Divided power he thus must subdivide :</l>
     <l n="376">In earlier days he rode , or sat at ease</l>
     <l n="377">Reclined , and having but himself to please ;</l>
     <l n="378">Now if he would a fav'rite nag bestride ,</l>
     <l n="379">He sought permission — “ Doctor , may I ride ? ”</l>
     <l n="380">( Rebecca 's eye her sovereign pleasure told ) -</l>
     <l n="381">“ I think you may , but guarded from the cold ,</l>
     <l n="382">Ride forty minutes . ” — Free and happy soul ,</l>
     <l n="383">He scorn 'd submission , and a man 's control ;</l>
     <l n="384">But where such friends in every care unite</l>
     <l n="385">All for his good , obedience is delight .</l>
     <l n="386">Now Gwyn a sultan bade affairs adieu ,</l>
     <l n="387">Led and assisted by the faithful two ;</l>
     <l n="388">The favourite fair , Rebecca , near him sat ,</l>
     <l n="389">And whisper 'd whom to love , assist , or hate ;</l>
     <l n="390">While the chief vizier eased his lord of cares ,</l>
     <l n="391">And bore himself the burden of affairs :</l>
     <l n="392">No dangers could from such alliance flow ,</l>
     <l n="393">But from that law that changes all below .</l>
     <l n="394">When wintry winds with leaves bestrew 'd the ground ,</l>
     <l n="395">And men were coughing all the village round ;</l>
     <l n="396">When public papers of invasion told ,</l>
     <l n="397">Diseases , famines , perils new and old ;</l>
     <l n="398">When philosophic writers fail 'd to clear</l>
     <l n="399">The mind of gloom , and lighter works to cheer ;</l>
     <l n="400">Then came fresh terrors on our hero 's mind -</l>
     <l n="401">Fears unforeseen , and feelings undefined .</l>
     <l n="402">“ In outward ills , ” he cried , “ I rest assured</l>
     <l n="403">Of my friend 's aid ; they will in time be cured ;</l>
     <l n="404">But can his art subdue , resist , control</l>
     <l n="405">These inward griefs and troubles of the soul ?</l>
     <l n="406">Oh ! my Rebecca ! my disorder 'd mind</l>
     <l n="407">No help in study , none in thought can find ;</l>
     <l n="408">What must I do , Rebecca ? ” She proposed</l>
     <l n="409">The Parish-guide ; but what could be disclosed</l>
     <l n="410">To a proud priest ?— “ No ! him have I defied ,</l>
     <l n="411">Insulted , slighted — shall he be my guide ?</l>
     <l n="412">But one there is , and if report be just ,</l>
     <l n="413">A wise good man , whom I may safely trust ;</l>
     <l n="414">Who goes from house to house , from ear to ear ,</l>
     <l n="415">To make his truths , his Gospel-truths , appear ;</l>
     <l n="416">True if indeed they be , ‘ tis time that I should hear :</l>
     <l n="417">Send for that man ; and if report be just ,</l>
     <l n="418">I , like Cornelius , will the teacher trust ;</l>
     <l n="419">But if deceiver , I the vile deceit</l>
     <l n="420">Shall soon discover , and discharge the cheat . ”</l>
     <l n="421">To Doctor Mollet was the grief confess " d ,</l>
     <l n="422">While Gwyn the freedom of his mind expressed ;</l>
     <l n="423">Yet own 'd it was to ills and errors prone ,</l>
     <l n="424">And he for guilt and frailty must atone .</l>
     <l n="425">“ My books , perhaps , ” the wav'ring mortal cried ,</l>
     <l n="426">“ Like men deceive ; I would be satisfied ; -</l>
     <l n="427">And to my soul the pious man may bring</l>
     <l n="428">Comfort and light : — do let me try the thing . ”</l>
     <l n="429">The cousins met , what pass 'd with Gwyn was told :</l>
     <l n="430">“ Alas ! ” the Doctor said , “ how hard to hold</l>
     <l n="431">These easy minds , where all impressions made</l>
     <l n="432">At first sink deeply , and then quickly fade ;</l>
     <l n="433">For while so strong these new-born fancies reign ,</l>
     <l n="434">We must divert them , to oppose is vain :</l>
     <l n="435">You see him valiant now , he scorns to heed</l>
     <l n="436">The bigot 's threat'nings or the zealot 's creed ;</l>
     <l n="437">Shook by a dream , he next for truth receives</l>
     <l n="438">What frenzy teaches , and what fear believes ;</l>
     <l n="439">And this will place him in the power of one</l>
     <l n="440">Whom we must seek , because we cannot shun . ”</l>
     <l n="441">Wisp had been ostler at a busy inn ,</l>
     <l n="442">Where he beheld and grew in dread of sin ;</l>
     <l n="443">Then to a Baptists ’ meeting found his way ,</l>
     <l n="444">Became a convert , and was taught to pray ;</l>
     <l n="445">Then preach 'd ; and , being earnest and sincere ,</l>
     <l n="446">Brought other sinners to religious fear :</l>
     <l n="447">Together grew his influence and his fame ,</l>
     <l n="448">Till our dejected hero heard his name :</l>
     <l n="449">His little failings were a grain of pride ,</l>
     <l n="450">Raised by the numbers he presumed to guide ;</l>
     <l n="451">A love of presents , and of lofty praise</l>
     <l n="452">For his meek spirit and his humble ways ;</l>
     <l n="453">But though this spirit would on flattery feed ,</l>
     <l n="454">No praise could blind him and no arts mislead : -</l>
     <l n="455">To him the Doctor made the wishes known</l>
     <l n="456">Of his good patron , but conceal 'd his own ;</l>
     <l n="457">He of all teachers had distrust and doubt ,</l>
     <l n="458">And was reserved in what he came about ;</l>
     <l n="459">Though on a plain and simple message sent ,</l>
     <l n="460">He had a secret and a bold intent :</l>
     <l n="461">Their minds at first were deeply veil 'd ; disguise</l>
     <l n="462">Form 'd the slow speech , and oped the eager eyes ;</l>
     <l n="463">Till by degrees sufficient light was thrown</l>
     <l n="464">On every view , and all the business shown .</l>
     <l n="465">Wisp , as a skilful guide who led the blind ,</l>
     <l n="466">Had powers to rule and awe the vapourish mind ;</l>
     <l n="467">But not the changeful will , the wavering fear to bind :</l>
     <l n="468">And should his conscience give him leave to dwell</l>
     <l n="469">With Gwyn , and every rival power expel</l>
     <l n="470">( A dubious point ) , yet he , with every care ,</l>
     <l n="471">Might soon the lot of the rejected share ;</l>
     <l n="472">And other Wisps he found like him to reign ,</l>
     <l n="473">And then be thrown upon the world again :</l>
     <l n="474">He thought it prudent then , and felt it just ,</l>
     <l n="475">The present guides of his new friend to trust :</l>
     <l n="476">True , he conceived , to touch the harder heart</l>
     <l n="477">Of the cool Doctor , was beyond his art ;</l>
     <l n="478">But mild Rebecca he could surely sway ,</l>
     <l n="479">While Gwyn would follow where she led the way :</l>
     <l n="480">So to do good , ( and why a duty shun ,</l>
     <l n="481">Because rewarded for the good when done ? )</l>
     <l n="482">He with his friends would join in all they plann 'd ,</l>
     <l n="483">Save when his faith or feelings should withstand ;</l>
     <l n="484">There he must rest sole judge of his affairs ,</l>
     <l n="485">While they might rule exclusively in theirs .</l>
     <l n="486">When Gwyn his message to the teacher sent ,</l>
     <l n="487">He fear 'd his friends would show their discontent ;</l>
     <l n="488">And prudent seem 'd it to th ’ attendant pair ,</l>
     <l n="489">Not all at once to show an aspect fair :</l>
     <l n="490">On Wisp they seem 'd to look with jealous eye ,</l>
     <l n="491">And fair Rebecca was demure and shy ;</l>
     <l n="492">But by degrees the teacher 's worth they knew ,</l>
     <l n="493">And were so kind , they seem 'd converted too .</l>
     <l n="494">Wisp took occasion to the nymph to say ,</l>
     <l n="495">“ You must be married : will you name the day ? ”</l>
     <l n="496">She smiled ,— “ ‘ Tis well : but should he not comply ,</l>
     <l n="497">Is it quite safe th ’ experiment to try ? ” -</l>
     <l n="498">“ My child , ” the teacher said , “ who feels remorse ,</l>
     <l n="499">( And feels not he ? ) must wish relief of course :</l>
     <l n="500">And can he find it , while he fears the crime ! -</l>
     <l n="501">You must be married ; will you name the time ? ”</l>
     <l n="502">Glad was the patron as a man could be ,</l>
     <l n="503">Yet marvell 'd too , to find his guides agree ;</l>
     <l n="504">“ But what the cause ? ” he cried ; “ ‘ tis genuine love for me . ”</l>
     <l n="505">Each found his part , and let one act describe</l>
     <l n="506">The powers and honours of th ’ accordant tribe : -</l>
     <l n="507">A man for favour to the mansion speeds ,</l>
     <l n="508">And cons his threefold task as he proceeds ;</l>
     <l n="509">To teacher Wisp he bows with humble air ,</l>
     <l n="510">And begs his interest for a barn 's repair :</l>
     <l n="511">Then for the Doctor he inquires , who loves</l>
     <l n="512">To hear applause for what his skill improves ,</l>
     <l n="513">And gives for praise , assent — and to the Fair</l>
     <l n="514">He brings of pullets a delicious pair ;</l>
     <l n="515">Thus sees a peasant , with discernment nice ,</l>
     <l n="516">A love of power , conceit , and avarice .</l>
     <l n="517">Lo ! now the change complete : the convert Gwyn</l>
     <l n="518">Has sold his books , and has renounced his sin ;</l>
     <l n="519">Mollet his body orders , Wisp his soul ,</l>
     <l n="520">And o'er his purse the Lady takes control ;</l>
     <l n="521">No friends beside he needs , and none attend -</l>
     <l n="522">Soul , body , and estate , has each a friend ;</l>
     <l n="523">And fair Rebecca leads a virtuous life -</l>
     <l n="524">She rules a mistress , and she reigns a wife .</l>

     <l n="19">Love will expire — the gay , the happy dream</l>
     <l n="20">Will turn to scorn , indiff'rence , or esteem :</l>
     <l n="21">Some favour 'd pairs , in this exchange , are blest ,</l>
     <l n="22">Nor sigh for raptures in a state of rest ;</l>
     <l n="23">Others , ill match 'd , with minds unpair 'd , repent</l>

     <l n="27">More luckless still their fate , who are the prey</l>
     <l n="28">Of long-protracted hope and dull delay :</l>
     <l n="29">‘ Mid plans of bliss the heavy hours pass on ,</l>
     <l n="30">Till love is withered , and till joy is gone .</l>
     <l n="31">This gentle flame two youthful hearts possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">The sweet disturber of unenvied rest ;</l>
     <l n="33">The prudent Dinah was the maid beloved ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the kind Rupert was the swain approved :</l>
     <l n="35">A wealthy Aunt her gentle niece sustain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="36">He , with a father , at his desk remain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="37">The youthful couple , to their vows sincere ,</l>
     <l n="38">Thus loved expectant ; year succeeding year ,</l>
     <l n="39">With pleasant views and hopes , but not a prospect near .</l>
     <l n="40">Rupert some comfort in his station saw ,</l>
     <l n="41">But the poor virgin lived in dread and awe ;</l>
     <l n="42">Upon her anxious looks the widow smiled ,</l>
     <l n="43">And bade her wait , “ for she was yet a child . ”</l>
     <l n="44">She for her neighbour had a due respect ,</l>
     <l n="45">Nor would his son encourage or reject ;</l>
     <l n="46">And thus the pair , with expectation vain ,</l>
     <l n="47">Beheld the seasons change and change again ;</l>
     <l n="48">Meantime the nymph her tender tales perused ,</l>
     <l n="49">Where cruel aunts impatient girls refused :</l>
     <l n="50">While hers , though teasing , boasted to be kind ,</l>
     <l n="51">And she , resenting , to be all resign 'd .</l>
     <l n="52">The dame was sick , and when the youth applied</l>
     <l n="53">For her consent , she groan 'd , and cough 'd , and cried ,</l>
     <l n="54">Talk 'd of departing , and again her breath</l>
     <l n="55">Drew hard , and cough 'd , and talk 'd again of death :</l>
     <l n="56">“ Here may you live , my Dinah ! here the boy</l>
     <l n="57">And you together my estate enjoy : ”</l>
     <l n="58">Thus to the lovers was her mind expressed ,</l>
     <l n="59">Till they forbore to urge the fond request .</l>
     <l n="60">Servant , and nurse , and comforter , and friend ,</l>
     <l n="61">Dinah had still some duty to attend ;</l>
     <l n="62">But yet their walk , when Rupert 's evening call</l>
     <l n="63">Obtain 'd an hour , made sweet amends for all ;</l>
     <l n="64">So long they now each other 's thoughts had known ,</l>
     <l n="65">That nothing seem 'd exclusively their own :</l>
     <l n="66">But with the common wish , the mutual fear ,</l>
     <l n="67">They now had travelled to their thirtieth year .</l>
     <l n="68">At length a prospect open 'd — but alas !</l>
     <l n="69">Long time must yet , before the union , pass .</l>
     <l n="70">Rupert was call 'd , in other clime , t'increase</l>
     <l n="71">Another 's wealth , and toil for future peace .</l>
     <l n="72">Loth were the lovers ; but the aunt declared</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Twas fortune 's call , and they must be prepar 'd :</l>
     <l n="74">“ You now are young , and for this brief delay ,</l>
     <l n="75">And Dinah 's care , what I bequeath will pay ;</l>
     <l n="76">All will be yours ; nay , love , suppress that sigh ;</l>
     <l n="77">The kind must suffer , and the best must die : ”</l>
     <l n="78">Then came the cough , and strong the signs it gave</l>
     <l n="79">Of holding long contention with the grave .</l>
     <l n="80">The lovers parted with a gloomy view ,</l>
     <l n="81">And little comfort , but that both were true ;</l>
     <l n="82">He for uncertain duties doom 'd to steer ,</l>
     <l n="83">While hers remain 'd too certain and severe .</l>
     <l n="84">Letters arrived , and Rupert fairly told</l>
     <l n="85">“ His cares were many , and his hopes were cold :</l>
     <l n="86">The view more clouded , that was never fair ,</l>
     <l n="87">And love alone preserved him from despair ; ”</l>
     <l n="88">In other letters brighter hopes he drew ,</l>
     <l n="89">“ His friends were kind , and he believed them true . ”</l>
     <l n="90">When the sage widow Dinah 's grief descried ,</l>
     <l n="91">She wonder 'd much why one so happy sigh 'd :</l>
     <l n="92">Then bade her see how her poor aunt sustain 'd</l>
     <l n="93">The ills of life , nor murmur 'd nor complain 'd .</l>
     <l n="94">To vary pleasures , from the lady 's chest</l>
     <l n="95">Were drawn the pearly string and tabby vest ;</l>
     <l n="96">Beads , jewels , laces , all their value shown ,</l>
     <l n="97">With the kind notice — “ They will be your own . ”</l>
     <l n="98">This hope , these comforts , cherish 'd day by day ,</l>
     <l n="99">To Dinah 's bosom made a gradual way ;</l>
     <l n="100">Till love of treasure had as large a part ,</l>
     <l n="101">As love of Rupert , in the virgin 's heart .</l>
     <l n="102">Whether it be that tender passions fail ,</l>
     <l n="103">From their own nature , while the strong prevail ;</l>
     <l n="104">Or whether av'rice , like the poison-tree ,</l>
     <l n="105">Kills all beside it , and alone will be ;</l>
     <l n="106">Whatever cause prevail 'd , the pleasure grew</l>
     <l n="107">In Dinah 's soul ,— she loved the hoards to view ;</l>
     <l n="108">With lively joy those comforts she survey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="109">And love grew languid in the careful maid .</l>
     <l n="110">Now the grave niece partook the widow 's cares ,</l>
     <l n="111">Look 'd to the great , and ruled the small affairs ;</l>
     <l n="112">Saw clean 'd the plate , arranged the china-show ,</l>
     <l n="113">And felt her passion for a shilling grow :</l>
     <l n="114">Th ’ indulgent aunt increased the maid 's delight ,</l>
     <l n="115">By placing tokens of her wealth in sight ;</l>
     <l n="116">She loved the value of her bonds to tell ,</l>
     <l n="117">And spake of stocks , and how they rose and fell .</l>
     <l n="118">This passion grew , and gain 'd at length such sway ,</l>
     <l n="119">That other passions shrank to make it way ;</l>
     <l n="120">Romantic notions now the heart forsook ,</l>
     <l n="121">She read but seldom , and she changed her book ;</l>
     <l n="122">And for the verses she was wont to send ,</l>
     <l n="123">Short was her prose , and she was Rupert 's friend .</l>
     <l n="124">Seldom she wrote , and then the widow 's cough ,</l>
     <l n="125">And constant call , excused her breaking off ;</l>
     <l n="126">Who now oppressed , no longer took the air ,</l>
     <l n="127">But sat and dozed upon an easy chair .</l>
     <l n="128">The cautious doctor saw the case was clear ,</l>
     <l n="129">But judged it best to have companions near ;</l>
     <l n="130">They came , they reason 'd , they prescribed ,— at last ,</l>
     <l n="131">Like honest men , they said their hopes were past ;</l>
     <l n="132">Then came a priest — ‘ tis comfort to reflect</l>
     <l n="133">When all is over , there was no neglect :</l>
     <l n="134">And all was over .— By her husband 's bones ,</l>
     <l n="135">The widow rests beneath the sculptured stones ,</l>
     <l n="136">That yet record their fondness and their fame ,</l>
     <l n="137">While all they left the virgin 's care became ;</l>
     <l n="138">Stock , bonds , and buildings ; it disturb 'd her rest ,</l>
     <l n="139">To think what load of troubles she possessed :</l>
     <l n="140">Yet , if a trouble , she resolved to take</l>
     <l n="141">Th ’ important duty for the donor 's sake ;</l>
     <l n="142">She too was heiress to the widow 's taste ,</l>
     <l n="143">Her love of hoarding , and her dread of waste .</l>
     <l n="144">Sometimes the past would on her mind intrude ,</l>
     <l n="145">And then a conflict full of care ensued ;</l>
     <l n="146">The thoughts of Rupert on her mind would press ,</l>
     <l n="147">His worth she knew , but doubted his success :</l>
     <l n="148">Of old she saw him heedless ; what the boy</l>
     <l n="149">Forebore to save , the man would not enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="150">Oft had he lost the chance that care would seize ,</l>
     <l n="151">Willing to live , but more to live at ease :</l>
     <l n="152">Yet could she not a broken vow defend ,</l>
     <l n="153">And Heav'n , perhaps , might yet enrich her friend .</l>
     <l n="154">Month after month was pass 'd , and all were spent</l>
     <l n="155">In quiet comfort , and in rich content ;</l>
     <l n="156">Miseries there were , and woes the world around ,</l>
     <l n="157">But these had not her pleasant dwelling found ;</l>
     <l n="158">She knew that mothers grieved , and widows wept ,</l>
     <l n="159">And she was sorry , said her prayers , and slept :</l>
     <l n="160">Thus passed the seasons , and to Dinah 's board</l>
     <l n="161">Gave what the seasons to the rich afford ;</l>
     <l n="162">For she indulged , nor was her heart so small ,</l>
     <l n="163">That one strong passion should engross it all .</l>
     <l n="164">A love of splendour now with av'rice strove ,</l>
     <l n="165">And oft appeared to be the stronger love :</l>
     <l n="166">A secret pleasure fill 'd the Widow 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="167">When she reflected on the hoards possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="168">But livelier joy inspired th ’ ambitious Maid ,</l>
     <l n="169">When she the purchase of those hoards display 'd :</l>
     <l n="170">In small but splendid room she loved to see</l>
     <l n="171">That all was placed in view and harmony .</l>
     <l n="172">There , as with eager glance she look 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="173">She much delight in every object found .</l>
     <l n="174">While books devout were near her — to destroy ,</l>
     <l n="175">Should it arise , an overflow of joy .</l>
     <l n="176">Within that fair apartment guests might see</l>
     <l n="177">The comforts cull 'd for wealth by vanity :</l>
     <l n="178">Around the room an Indian paper blazed ,</l>
     <l n="179">With lively tint and figures boldly raised ;</l>
     <l n="180">Silky and soft upon the floor below ,</l>
     <l n="181">Th ’ elastic carpet rose with crimson glow ;</l>
     <l n="182">All things around implied both cost and care ,</l>
     <l n="183">What met the eye was elegant or rare :</l>
     <l n="184">Some curious trifles round the room were laid ,</l>
     <l n="185">By hope presented to the wealthy Maid ;</l>
     <l n="186">Within a costly case of varnish 'd wood ,</l>
     <l n="187">In level rows , her polish 'd volumes stood ;</l>
     <l n="188">Shown as a favour to a chosen few ,</l>
     <l n="189">To prove what beauty for a book could do :</l>
     <l n="190">A silver urn with curious work was fraught ;</l>
     <l n="191">A silver lamp from Grecian pattern wrought :</l>
     <l n="192">Above her head , all gorgeous to behold ,</l>
     <l n="193">A time-piece stood on feet of burnish 'd gold ;</l>
     <l n="194">A stag'shYpppHeNhead crest adorn 'd the pictured case ,</l>
     <l n="195">Through the pure crystal shone the enamel 'd face ;</l>
     <l n="196">And while on brilliants moved the hands of steel ,</l>
     <l n="197">It click 'd from pray'r to pray'r , from meal to meal .</l>
     <l n="198">Here as the lady sat , a friendly pair</l>
     <l n="199">Stept in t'admire the view , and took their chair :</l>
     <l n="200">They then related how the young and gay</l>
     <l n="201">Were thoughtless wandering in the broad highway :</l>
     <l n="202">How tender damsels sail 'd in tilted boats ,</l>
     <l n="203">And laugh 'd with wicked men in scarlet coats ;</l>
     <l n="204">And how we live in such degen'rate times ,</l>
     <l n="205">That men conceal their wants and show their crimes ;</l>
     <l n="206">While vicious deeds are screen 'd by fashion 's name ,</l>
     <l n="207">And what was once our pride is now our shame .</l>
     <l n="208">Dinah was musing , as her friends discoursed ,</l>
     <l n="209">When these last words a sudden entrance forced</l>
     <l n="210">Upon her mind , and what was once her pride</l>
     <l n="211">And now her shame , some painful views supplied ;</l>
     <l n="212">Thoughts of the past within her bosom press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="213">And there a change was felt , and was confess 'd :</l>
     <l n="214">While thus the Virgin strove with secret pain ,</l>
     <l n="215">Her mind was wandering o'er the troubled main ;</l>
     <l n="216">Still she was silent , nothing seem 'd to see ,</l>
     <l n="217">But sat and sigh 'd in pensive reverie .</l>
     <l n="218">The friends prepared new subjects to begin ,</l>
     <l n="219">When tall Susannah , maiden starch , stalk 'd in ;</l>
     <l n="220">Not in her ancient mode , sedate and slow ,</l>
     <l n="221">As when she came , the mind she knew , to know ;</l>
     <l n="222">Nor as , when list'ning half an hour before ,</l>
     <l n="223">She twice or thrice tapp 'd gently at the door ;</l>
     <l n="224">But all decorum cast in wrath aside ,</l>
     <l n="225">“ I think the devil 's in the man ! ” she cried ;</l>
     <l n="226">“ A huge tall sailor , with his tawny cheek</l>
     <l n="227">And pitted face , will with my lady speak ;</l>
     <l n="228">He grinn 'd an ugly smile , and said he knew ,</l>
     <l n="229">Please you , my lady , ‘ t would be joy to you :</l>
     <l n="230">What must I answer ? ” — Trembling and distress 'd</l>
     <l n="231">Sank the pale Dinah by her fears oppress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="232">When thus alarm 'd and brooking no delay ,</l>
     <l n="233">Swift to her room the stranger made his way .</l>
     <l n="234">“ Revive , my love ! ” said he , “ I 've done thee harm ;</l>
     <l n="235">Give me thy pardon , ” and he look 'd alarm :</l>
     <l n="236">Meantime the prudent Dinah had contrived</l>
     <l n="237">Her soul to question , and she then revived .</l>
     <l n="238">“ See ! my good friend , ” and then she raised her head ,</l>
     <l n="239">“ The bloom of life , the strength of youth is fled ;</l>
     <l n="240">Living we die ; to us the world is dead ;</l>
     <l n="241">We parted bless 'd with health , and I am now</l>
     <l n="242">Age-struck and feeble — so I find art thou ;</l>
     <l n="243">Thine eye is sunken , furrow 'd is thy face ,</l>
     <l n="244">And downward look'st thou — so we run our race ;</l>
     <l n="245">And happier they whose race is nearly run ,</l>
     <l n="246">Their troubles over , and their duties done . ”</l>
     <l n="247">“ True , lady , true — we are not girl and boy ,</l>
     <l n="248">But time has left us something to enjoy . ”</l>
     <l n="249">“ What ! hast thou learn 'd my fortune ?— yes , I live</l>
     <l n="250">To feel how poor the comforts wealth can give :</l>
     <l n="251">Thou too perhaps art wealthy ; but our fate</l>
     <l n="252">Still mocks our wishes , wealth is come too late . ”</l>
     <l n="253">“ To me nor late nor early ; I am come</l>
     <l n="254">Poor as I left thee to my native home :</l>
     <l n="255">Nor yet , ” said Rupert , “ will I grieve ; ‘ tis mine</l>
     <l n="256">To share thy comforts , and the glory thine :</l>
     <l n="257">For thou wilt gladly take that generous part</l>
     <l n="258">That both exalts and gratifies the heart ;</l>
     <l n="259">While mine rejoices ” — “ Heavens ! ” return 'd the maid ,</l>
     <l n="260">“ This talk to one so wither 'd and decay 'd ?</l>
     <l n="261">No ! all my care is now to fit my mind</l>
     <l n="262">For other spousal , and to die resigned :</l>
     <l n="263">As friend and neighbour , I shall hope to see</l>
     <l n="264">These noble views , this pious love in thee ;</l>
     <l n="265">That we together may the change await ,</l>
     <l n="266">Guides and spectators in each other 's fate ;</l>
     <l n="267">When fellow pilgrims , we shall daily crave</l>
     <l n="268">The mutual prayer that arms us for the grave . ”</l>
     <l n="269">Half angry , half in doubt , the lover gazed</l>
     <l n="270">On the meek maiden , by her speech amazed ;</l>
     <l n="271">“ Dinah , ” said he , “ dost thou respect thy vows ?</l>
     <l n="272">What spousal mean'st thou ?— thou art Rupert 's spouse ;</l>
     <l n="273">That chance is mine to take , and thine to give :</l>
     <l n="274">But , trifling this , if we together live :</l>
     <l n="275">Can I believe , that , after all the past ,</l>
     <l n="276">Our vows , our loves , thou wilt be false at last ?</l>
     <l n="277">Something thou hast — I know not what — in view ;</l>
     <l n="278">I find thee pious — let me find thee true . ”</l>
     <l n="279">“ Ah ! cruel this ; but do , my friend , depart ;</l>
     <l n="280">And to its feelings leave my wounded heart . ”</l>
     <l n="281">“ Nay , speak at once ; and Dinah , let me know ,</l>
     <l n="282">Mean'st thou to take me , now I 'm wreck 'd , in tow ?</l>
     <l n="283">Be fair ; nor longer keep me in the dark ;</l>
     <l n="284">Am I forsaken for a trimmer spark ?</l>
     <l n="285">Heaven 's spouse thou art not ; nor can I believe</l>
     <l n="286">That God accepts her who will man deceive :</l>
     <l n="287">True I am shatter 'd , I have service seen ,</l>
     <l n="288">And service done , and have in trouble been ;</l>
     <l n="289">My cheek ( it shames me not ) has lost its red ,</l>
     <l n="290">And the brown buff is o'er my features spread :</l>
     <l n="291">Perchance my speech is rude ; for I among</l>
     <l n="292">Th ’ untamed have been , in temper and in tongue ;</l>
     <l n="293">Have been trepann 'd , have lived in toil and care ,</l>
     <l n="294">And wrought for wealth I was not doom 'd to share ;</l>
     <l n="295">It touch 'd me deeply , for I felt a pride</l>
     <l n="296">In gaining riches for my destin 'd bride :</l>
     <l n="297">Speak then my fate ; for these my sorrows past ,</l>
     <l n="298">Time lost , youth fled , hope wearied , and at last</l>
     <l n="299">This doubt of thee — a childish thing to tell ,</l>
     <l n="300">But certain truth — my very throat they swell :</l>
     <l n="301">They stop the breath , and but for shame could I</l>
     <l n="302">Give way to weakness , and with passion cry ;</l>
     <l n="303">These are unmanly struggles , but I feel</l>
     <l n="304">This hour must end them , and perhaps will heal . ”</l>
     <l n="305">Here Dinah sigh 'd , as if afraid to speak -</l>
     <l n="306">And then repeated — “ They were frail and weak :</l>
     <l n="307">His soul she lov 'd , and hoped he had the grace</l>
     <l n="308">To fix his thoughts upon a better place . ”</l>
     <l n="309">She ceased ;— with steady glance , as if to see</l>
     <l n="310">The very root of this hypocrisy , -</l>
     <l n="311">He her small fingers moulded in his hard</l>
     <l n="312">And bronzed broad hand ; then told her his regard ,</l>
     <l n="313">His best respect were gone , but love had still</l>
     <l n="314">Hold in his heart , and govern 'd yet the will -</l>
     <l n="315">Or he would curse her : — saying this , he threw</l>
     <l n="316">The hand in scorn away , and bade adieu</l>
     <l n="317">To every lingering hope , with every care in view .</l>
     <l n="318">Proud and indignant , suffering , sick , and poor ,</l>
     <l n="319">He grieved unseen : and spoke of love no more -</l>
     <l n="320">Till all he felt in indignation died ,</l>
     <l n="321">As hers had sunk in avarice and pride .</l>
     <l n="322">In health declining , as in mind distressed ,</l>
     <l n="323">To some in power his troubles he confess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="324">And shares a parish-gift ; at prayers he sees</l>
     <l n="325">The pious Dinah dropp 'd upon her knees ;</l>
     <l n="326">Thence as she walks the street with stately air</l>
     <l n="327">As chance directs , oft meet the parted pair ;</l>
     <l n="328">When he , with thickset coat of badgeman 's blue ,</l>
     <l n="329">Moves near her shaded silk of changeful hue ;</l>
     <l n="330">When his thin locks of gray approach her braid ,</l>
     <l n="331">A costly purchase made in Beauty 's aid ;</l>
     <l n="332">When his frank air , and his unstudied pace ,</l>
     <l n="333">Are seen with her soft manner , air , and grace ;</l>
     <l n="334">And his plain artless look with her sharp meaning face ;</l>
     <l n="335">It might some wonder in a stranger move ,</l>
     <l n="336">How these together could have talk 'd of love .</l>
     <l n="337">Behold them now !— see there a tradesman stands ,</l>
     <l n="338">And humbly hearkens to some fresh commands ;</l>
     <l n="339">He moves to speak , she interrupts him — “ Stay , ”</l>
     <l n="340">Her air expresses ,— “ Hark to what I say ! ”</l>
     <l n="341">Ten paces off , poor Rupert on a seat</l>
     <l n="342">Has taken refuge from the noon-day heat ,</l>
     <l n="343">His eyes on her intent , as if to find</l>
     <l n="344">What were the movements of that subtle mind :</l>
     <l n="345">How still !— how earnest is he !— it appears</l>
     <l n="346">His thoughts are wand'ring through his earlier years ;</l>
     <l n="347">Through years of fruitless labour , to the day</l>
     <l n="348">When all his earthly prospects died away :</l>
     <l n="349">“ Had I , ” he thinks , “ been wealthier of the two ,</l>
     <l n="350">Would she have found me so unkind , untrue ?</l>
     <l n="351">Or knows not man when poor , what man when rich will do ?</l>
     <l n="352">Yes , yes ! I feel that I had faithful proved ,</l>
     <l n="353">And should have soothed and raised her , bless 'd and loved . ”</l>
     <l n="354">But Dinah moves — she had observed before</l>
     <l n="355">The pensive Rupert at an humble door :</l>
     <l n="356">Some thoughts of pity raised by his distress ,</l>
     <l n="357">Some feeling touch of ancient tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="358">Religion , duty urged the maid to speak ,</l>
     <l n="359">In terms of kindness to a man so weak :</l>
     <l n="360">But pride forbade , and to return would prove</l>
     <l n="361">She felt the shame of his neglected love ;</l>
     <l n="362">Nor wrapp 'd in silence could she pass , afraid</l>
     <l n="363">Each eye should see her , and each heart upbraid ;</l>
     <l n="364">One way remain 'd — the way the Levite took ,</l>
     <l n="365">Who without mercy could on misery look ;</l>
     <l n="366">( A way perceiv 'd by craft , approved by pride ) ,</l>
     <l n="367">She cross 'd and pass 'd him on the other side .</l>

     <l n="15">A Borough-Bailiff , who to law was train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="16">A wife and sons in decent state maintain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="17">He had his way in life 's rough ocean steer 'd</l>
     <l n="18">And many a rock and coast of danger clear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="19">He saw where others fail 'd , and care had he ,</l>
     <l n="20">Others in him should not such feelings see :</l>
     <l n="21">His sons in various busy states were placed ,</l>
     <l n="22">And all began the sweets of gain to taste ,</l>
     <l n="23">Save John , the younger , who , of sprightly parts ,</l>
     <l n="24">Felt not a love for money-making arts :</l>
     <l n="25">In childhood feeble , he , for country air ,</l>
     <l n="26">Had long resided with a rustic pair ;</l>
     <l n="27">All round whose room were doleful ballads , songs ,</l>
     <l n="28">Of lovers ’ sufferings and of ladies ’ wrongs ;</l>
     <l n="29">Of peevish ghosts who came at dark midnight ,</l>
     <l n="30">For breach of promise , guilty men to fright ;</l>
     <l n="31">Love , marriage , murder , were the themes , with these ,</l>
     <l n="32">All that on idle , ardent spirits seize ;</l>
     <l n="33">Robbers at land and pirates on the main ,</l>
     <l n="34">Enchanters foil 'd , spells broken , giants slain ;</l>
     <l n="35">Legends of love , with tales of halls and bowers ,</l>
     <l n="36">Choice of rare songs , and garlands of choice flowers ,</l>
     <l n="37">And all the hungry mind without a choice devours .</l>
     <l n="38">From village-children kept apart by pride ,</l>
     <l n="39">With such enjoyments , and without a guide ,</l>
     <l n="40">Inspired by feelings all such works infused ,</l>
     <l n="41">John snatch 'd a pen , and wrote as he perused :</l>
     <l n="42">With the like fancy he could make his knight</l>
     <l n="43">Slay half a host , and put the rest to flight ;</l>
     <l n="44">With the like knowledge he could make him ride</l>
     <l n="45">From isle to isle at Parthenissa 's side ;</l>
     <l n="46">And with a heart yet free , no busy brain</l>
     <l n="47">Form 'd wilder notions of delight and pain ,</l>
     <l n="48">The raptures smiles create , the anguish of disdain .</l>
     <l n="49">Such were the fruits of John 's poetic toil -</l>
     <l n="50">Weeds , but still proofs of vigour in the soil :</l>
     <l n="51">He nothing purposed but with vast delight ,</l>
     <l n="52">Let Fancy loose , and wonder 'd at her flight :</l>
     <l n="53">His notions of poetic worth were high ,</l>
     <l n="54">And of his own still-hoarded poetry ; -</l>
     <l n="55">These to his father 's house he bore with pride ,</l>
     <l n="56">A miser 's treasure , in his room to hide ;</l>
     <l n="57">Till spurr 'd by glory , to a reading friend ,</l>
     <l n="58">He kindly show 'd the sonnets he had penn 'd :</l>
     <l n="59">With erring judgment , though with heart sincere ,</l>
     <l n="60">That friend exclaim 'd , “ These beauties must appear . ’</l>
     <l n="61">In magazines they claim 'd their share of fame ,</l>
     <l n="62">Though undistinguish 'd by their author 's name ;</l>
     <l n="63">And with delight the young enthusiast found</l>
     <l n="64">The muse of Marcus with applauses crown 'd .</l>
     <l n="65">This heard the father , and with some alarm ;</l>
     <l n="66">“ The boy , ” said he , “ will neither trade nor farm ,</l>
     <l n="67">He for both law and physic is unfit ,</l>
     <l n="68">Wit he may have , but cannot live on wit :</l>
     <l n="69">Let him his talents then to learning give ,</l>
     <l n="70">Where verse is honour 'd , and where poets live . ”</l>
     <l n="71">John kept his terms at college unreproved ,</l>
     <l n="72">Took his degree , and left the life he loved ;</l>
     <l n="73">Not yet ordain 'd , his leisure he employ 'd</l>
     <l n="74">In the light labours he so much enjoy 'd ;</l>
     <l n="75">His favourite notions and his daring views</l>
     <l n="76">Were cherish 'd still , and he adored the Muse .</l>
     <l n="77">“ A little time , and he should burst to light ,</l>
     <l n="78">And admiration of the world excite ;</l>
     <l n="79">And every friend , now cool and apt to blame</l>
     <l n="80">His fond pursuit , would wonder at his fame . ”</l>
     <l n="81">When led by fancy , and from view retired ,</l>
     <l n="82">He call 'd before him all his heart desired ;</l>
     <l n="83">“ Fame shall be mine , then wealth shall I possess ,</l>
     <l n="84">And beauty next an ardent lover bless ;</l>
     <l n="85">For me the maid shall leave her nobler state ,</l>
     <l n="86">Happy to raise and share her poet 's fate . ”</l>
     <l n="87">He saw each day his father 's frugal board ,</l>
     <l n="88">With simple fare by cautious prudence stored :</l>
     <l n="89">Where each indulgence was foreweigh 'd with care ,</l>
     <l n="90">And the grand maxims were to save and spare :</l>
     <l n="91">Yet in his walks , his closet , and his bed ,</l>
     <l n="92">All frugal cares and prudent counsels fled ;</l>
     <l n="93">And bounteous Fancy , for his glowing mind ,</l>
     <l n="94">Wrought various scenes , and all of glorious kind :</l>
     <l n="95">Slaves of the ring and lamp ! what need of you ,</l>
     <l n="96">When Fancy 's self such magic deeds can do ?</l>
     <l n="97">Though rapt in visions of no vulgar kind ,</l>
     <l n="98">To common subjects stoop 'd our poet 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="99">And oft when wearied with more ardent flight ,</l>
     <l n="100">He felt a spur satiric song to write ;</l>
     <l n="101">A rival burgess his bold Muse attack 'd ,</l>
     <l n="102">And whipp 'd severely for a well known fact ;</l>
     <l n="103">For while he seem 'd to all demure and shy ,</l>
     <l n="104">Our poet gazed at what was passing by ;</l>
     <l n="105">And e'en his father smiled when playful wit ,</l>
     <l n="106">From his young bard , some haughty object hit .</l>
     <l n="107">From ancient times , the borough where they dwelt</l>
     <l n="108">Had mighty contests at elections felt ;</l>
     <l n="109">Sir Godfrey Ball , ‘ tis true , had held in pay</l>
     <l n="110">Electors many for the trying day ;</l>
     <l n="111">But in such golden chains to bind them all</l>
     <l n="112">Required too much for e'en Sir Godfrey Ball .</l>
     <l n="113">A member died , and to supply his place</l>
     <l n="114">Two heroes enter 'd for th ’ important race ;</l>
     <l n="115">Sir Godfrey 's friend and Earl Fitzdonnel 's son ,</l>
     <l n="116">Lord Frederick Darner , both prepared to run ;</l>
     <l n="117">And partial numbers saw with vast delight</l>
     <l n="118">Their good young lord oppose the proud old knight .</l>
     <l n="119">Our poet 's father , at a first request ,</l>
     <l n="120">Gave the young lord his vote and interest ;</l>
     <l n="121">And what he could our poet , for he stung</l>
     <l n="122">The foe by verse satiric , said and sung .</l>
     <l n="123">Lord Frederick heard of all this youthful zeal ,</l>
     <l n="124">And felt as lords upon a canvass feel ;</l>
     <l n="125">He read the satire , and he saw the use</l>
     <l n="126">That such cool insult , and such keen abuse ,</l>
     <l n="127">Might on the wavering minds of voting men produce ;</l>
     <l n="128">Then too his praises were in contrast seen ,</l>
     <l n="129">“ A lord as noble as the knight was mean . ”</l>
     <l n="130">“ I much rejoice , ” he cried , “ such worth to find ;</l>
     <l n="131">To this the world must be no longer blind :</l>
     <l n="132">His glory will descend from sire to son ,</l>
     <l n="133">The Burns of English race , the happier Chatterton . ”</l>
     <l n="134">Our poet 's mind now hurried and elate ,</l>
     <l n="135">Alarm 'd the anxious parent for his fate ;</l>
     <l n="136">Who saw with sorrow , should their friend succeed ,</l>
     <l n="137">That much discretion would the poet need .</l>
     <l n="138">Their friends succeeded , and repaid the zeal</l>
     <l n="139">The Poet felt , and made opposers feel ,</l>
     <l n="140">By praise ( from lords how soothing and how sweet ! )</l>
     <l n="141">An invitation to his noble seat .</l>
     <l n="142">The father ponder 'd , doubtful if the brain</l>
     <l n="143">Of his proud boy such honour could sustain ;</l>
     <l n="144">Pleased with the favours offer 'd to a son ,</l>
     <l n="145">But seeing dangers few so ardent shun .</l>
     <l n="146">Thus when they parted , to the youthful breast</l>
     <l n="147">The father 's fears were by his love impress 'd :</l>
     <l n="148">“ There will you find , my son , the courteous ease</l>
     <l n="149">That must subdue the soul it means to please ;</l>
     <l n="150">That soft attention which e'en beauty pays</l>
     <l n="151">To wake our passions , or provoke our praise ;</l>
     <l n="152">There all the eye beholds will give delight ,</l>
     <l n="153">Where every sense is flatter 'd like the sight ;</l>
     <l n="154">This is your peril ; can you from such scene</l>
     <l n="155">Of splendour part , and feel your mind serene ,</l>
     <l n="156">And in the father 's humble state resume</l>
     <l n="157">The frugal diet and the narrow room ? ”</l>
     <l n="158">To this the youth with cheerful heart replied ,</l>
     <l n="159">Pleased with the trial , but as yet untried ;</l>
     <l n="160">And while professing patience , should he fail ,</l>
     <l n="161">He suffered hope o'er reason to prevail .</l>
     <l n="162">Impatient , by the morning mail conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="163">The happy guest his promised visit paid ;</l>
     <l n="164">And now arriving at the Hall , he tried</l>
     <l n="165">For air composed , serene and satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="166">As he had practised in his room alone ,</l>
     <l n="167">And there acquired a free and easy tone :</l>
     <l n="168">There he had said , “ Whatever the degree</l>
     <l n="169">A man obtains , what more than man is he ? ”</l>
     <l n="170">And when arrived — “ This room is but a room ;</l>
     <l n="171">Can aught we see the steady soul o'ercome ?</l>
     <l n="172">Let me in all a manly firmness show ,</l>
     <l n="173">Upheld by talents , and their value know . ”</l>
     <l n="174">This reason urged ; but it surpassed his skill</l>
     <l n="175">To be in act as manly as in will :</l>
     <l n="176">When he his Lordship and the Lady saw</l>
     <l n="177">Brave as he was , he felt oppress 'd with awe ;</l>
     <l n="178">And spite of verse , that so much praise had won ,</l>
     <l n="179">The poet found he was the Bailiff 's son .</l>
     <l n="180">But dinner came , and the succeeding hours</l>
     <l n="181">Fix 'd his weak nerves , and raised his failing powers ;</l>
     <l n="182">Praised and assured , he ventured once or twice</l>
     <l n="183">On some remark , and bravely broke the ice ;</l>
     <l n="184">So that , at night , reflecting on his words ,</l>
     <l n="185">He found , in time , he might converse with lords .</l>
     <l n="186">Now was the Sister of his Patron seen -</l>
     <l n="187">A lovely creature , with majestic mien ;</l>
     <l n="188">Who , softly smiling , while she looked so fair ,</l>
     <l n="189">Praised the young poet with such friendly air ;</l>
     <l n="190">Such winning frankness in her looks express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="191">And such attention to her brother 's guest ;</l>
     <l n="192">That so much beauty , join 'd with speech so kind ,</l>
     <l n="193">Raised strong emotions in the poet 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="194">Till reason fail 'd his bosom to defend ,</l>
     <l n="195">From the sweet power of this enchanting friend . -</l>
     <l n="196">Rash boy ! what hope thy frantic mind invades ?</l>
     <l n="197">What love confuses , and what pride persuades ?</l>
     <l n="198">Awake to truth ! shouldst thou deluded feed</l>
     <l n="199">On hopes so groundless , thou art mad indeed .</l>
     <l n="200">What say'st thou , wise one ?— “ that all powerful Love</l>
     <l n="201">Can fortune 's strong impediments remove ;</l>
     <l n="202">Nor is it strange that worth should wed to worth ,</l>
     <l n="203">The pride of genius with the pride of birth . ”</l>
     <l n="204">While thou art dreaming thus , the Beauty spies</l>
     <l n="205">Love in thy tremor , passion in thine eyes ;</l>
     <l n="206">And with th ’ amusement pleased , of conquest vain ,</l>
     <l n="207">She seeks her pleasure , careless of thy pain ;</l>
     <l n="208">She gives thee praise to humble and confound ,</l>
     <l n="209">Smiles to ensnare , and flatters thee to wound .</l>
     <l n="210">Why has she said that in the lowest state</l>
     <l n="211">The noble mind ensures a noble fate ?</l>
     <l n="212">And why thy daring mind to glory call ? -</l>
     <l n="213">That thou may'st dare and suffer , soar and fall .</l>
     <l n="214">Beauties are tyrants , and if they can reign ,</l>
     <l n="215">They have no feeling for their subjects ’ pain :</l>
     <l n="216">Their victim 's anguish gives their charms applause ,</l>
     <l n="217">And their chief glory is the woe they cause :</l>
     <l n="218">Something of this was felt , in spite of love ,</l>
     <l n="219">Which hope , in spite of reason , would remove .</l>
     <l n="220">Thus lived our youth , with conversation , books ,</l>
     <l n="221">And Lady Emma 's soul-subduing looks :</l>
     <l n="222">Lost in delight , astonish 'd at his lot ,</l>
     <l n="223">All prudence banish 'd , all advice forgot -</l>
     <l n="224">Hopes , fears , and every thought , were fix 'd upon the spot .</l>
     <l n="225">‘ Twas autumn yet , and many a day must frown</l>
     <l n="226">On Brandon-Hall , ere went my Lord to town ;</l>
     <l n="227">Meantime the father , who had heard his boy</l>
     <l n="228">Lived in a round of luxury and joy ,</l>
     <l n="229">And justly thinking that the youth was one</l>
     <l n="230">Who , meeting danger , was unskill 'd to shun ;</l>
     <l n="231">Knowing his temper , virtue , spirit , zeal ,</l>
     <l n="232">How prone to hope and trust , believe and feel ;</l>
     <l n="233">These on the parent 's soul their weight impress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="234">And thus he wrote the counsels of his breast : -</l>

     <l n="239">Whereas this genius , like a bill must take</l>

     <l n="437">And , as before , with praises overflowed ;</l>
     <l n="438">But his grave Lady took a silent view</l>
     <l n="439">Of all that pass 'd , and smiling , pitied too .</l>
     <l n="440">Cold grew the foggy morn , the day was brief ,</l>
     <l n="441">Loose on the cherry hung the crimson leaf ;</l>
     <l n="442">The dew dwelt ever on the herb ; the woods</l>
     <l n="443">Roar 'd with strong blasts , with mighty showers the floods :</l>
     <l n="444">All green was vanish 'd , save of pine and yew ,</l>
     <l n="445">That still displayed their melancholy hue ;</l>
     <l n="446">Save the green holly with its berries red ,</l>
     <l n="447">And the green moss that o'er the gravel spread .</l>
     <l n="448">To public views my Lord must soon attend ;</l>
     <l n="449">And soon the ladies — would they leave their friend ?</l>
     <l n="450">The time was fix 'd — approach 'd — was near — was come ;</l>
     <l n="451">The trying time that fill 'd his soul with gloom :</l>
     <l n="452">Thoughtful our poet in the morning rose ,</l>
     <l n="453">And cried , “ One hour my fortune will disclose ;</l>
     <l n="454">Terrific hour ! from thee have I to date</l>
     <l n="455">Life 's loftier views , or my degraded state ;</l>
     <l n="456">For now to be what I have been before</l>
     <l n="457">Is so to fall , that I can rise no more . ”</l>
     <l n="458">The morning meal was past ; and all around</l>
     <l n="459">The mansion rang with each discordant sound ;</l>
     <l n="460">Haste was in every foot , and every look</l>
     <l n="461">The trav'ller ' s joy for London-journey spoke :</l>
     <l n="462">Not so our youth ; whose feelings at the noise</l>
     <l n="463">Of preparation , had no touch of joys :</l>
     <l n="464">He pensive stood , and saw each carriage drawn ,</l>
     <l n="465">With lackeys mounted , ready on the lawn :</l>
     <l n="466">The ladies came ; and John in terror threw</l>
     <l n="467">One painful glance , and then his eyes withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="468">Not with such speed , but he in other eyes</l>
     <l n="469">With anguish read — “ I pity , but despise -</l>
     <l n="470">Unhappy boy !— presumptuous scribbler !— you ,</l>
     <l n="471">To dream such dreams !— be sober , and adieu ! ”</l>
     <l n="472">Then came the Noble Friend — “ And will my Lord</l>
     <l n="473">Vouchsafe no comfort ; drop no soothing word ?</l>
     <l n="474">Yes , he must speak ; ” he speaks , “ My good young friend ,</l>
     <l n="475">You know my views ; upon my care depend ;</l>
     <l n="476">My hearty thanks to your good father pay ,</l>
     <l n="477">And be a student .— Harry , drive away . ”</l>
     <l n="478">Stillness reign 'd all around ; of late so full</l>
     <l n="479">The busy scene , deserted now and dull :</l>
     <l n="480">Stern is his nature who forbears to feel</l>
     <l n="481">Gloom o'er his spirits on such trials steal ;</l>
     <l n="482">Most keenly felt our poet as he went</l>
     <l n="483">From room to room without a fix 'd intent ;</l>
     <l n="484">“ And here , ” he thought , “ I was caress 'd ; admired</l>
     <l n="485">Were here my songs ; she smiled , and I aspired .</l>
     <l n="486">The change how grievous ! ” As he mused , a dame</l>
     <l n="487">Busy and peevish to her duties came ;</l>
     <l n="488">Aside the tables and the chairs she drew ,</l>
     <l n="489">And sang and mutter 'd in the poet 's view : -</l>
     <l n="490">“ This was her fortune ; here they leave the poor ;</l>
     <l n="491">Enjoy themselves , and think of us no more ;</l>
     <l n="492">I had a promise ” — here his pride and shame</l>
     <l n="493">Urged him to fly from this familiar dame ;</l>
     <l n="494">He gave one farewell look , and by a coach</l>
     <l n="495">Reach 'd his own mansion at the night 's approach .</l>
     <l n="496">His father met him with an anxious air ,</l>
     <l n="497">Heard his sad tale , and check 'd what seem 'd despair :</l>
     <l n="498">Hope was in him corrected , but alive ;</l>
     <l n="499">My lord would something for a friend contrive ;</l>
     <l n="500">His word was pledged : our hero 's feverish mind</l>
     <l n="501">Admitted this , and half his grief resigned :</l>
     <l n="502">But , when three months had fled , and every day</l>
     <l n="503">Drew from the sickening hopes their strength away ,</l>
     <l n="504">The youth became abstracted , pensive , dull ;</l>
     <l n="505">He utter 'd nothing , though his heart was full ;</l>
     <l n="506">Teased by inquiring words and anxious looks ,</l>
     <l n="507">And all forgetful of his Muse and books ;</l>
     <l n="508">Awake he mourn 'd , but in his sleep perceived</l>
     <l n="509">A lovely vision that his pain relieved : -</l>
     <l n="510">His soul , transported , hail 'd the happy seat ,</l>
     <l n="511">Where once his pleasure was so pure and sweet ;</l>
     <l n="512">Where joys departed came in blissful view</l>
     <l n="513">Till reason waked , and not a joy he knew .</l>
     <l n="514">Questions now vex 'd his spirit , most from those</l>
     <l n="515">Who are call 'd friends , because they are not foes :</l>
     <l n="516">“ John ? ” they would say ; he , starting , turn 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="517">“ John ! ” there was something shocking in the sound :</l>
     <l n="518">Ill brook 'd he then the pert familiar phrase ,</l>
     <l n="519">The untaught freedom and th ’ inquiring gaze ;</l>
     <l n="520">Much was his temper touch 'd , his spleen provoked ,</l>
     <l n="521">When ask 'd how ladies talk 'd , or walk 'd , or look 'd ?</l>
     <l n="522">“ What said my Lord of politics ! how spent</l>
     <l n="523">He there his time ? and was he glad he went ? ”</l>
     <l n="524">At length a letter came , both cool and brief ,</l>
     <l n="525">But still it gave the burden 'd heart relief :</l>
     <l n="526">Though not inspired by lofty hopes , the youth</l>
     <l n="527">Placed much reliance on Lord Frederick 's truth ;</l>
     <l n="528">Summon 'd to town , he thought the visit one</l>
     <l n="529">Where something fair and friendly would be done ;</l>
     <l n="530">Although he judged not , as before his fall ,</l>
     <l n="531">When all was love and promise at the hall .</l>
     <l n="532">Arrived in town , he early sought to know</l>
     <l n="533">The fate such dubious friendship would bestow ;</l>
     <l n="534">At a tall building trembling he appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="535">And his low rap was indistinctly heard ;</l>
     <l n="536">A well-known servant came — “ Awhile , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="537">“ Be pleased to wait ; my Lord has company . ”</l>
     <l n="538">Alone our hero sat ; the news in hand ,</l>
     <l n="539">Which though he read , he could not understand :</l>
     <l n="540">Cold was the day ; in days so cold as these</l>
     <l n="541">There needs a fire , where minds and bodies freeze .</l>
     <l n="542">The vast and echoing room , the polish 'd grate ,</l>
     <l n="543">The crimson chairs , the sideboard with its plate ;</l>
     <l n="544">The splendid sofa , which , though made for rest ,</l>
     <l n="545">He then had thought it freedom to have press 'd ;</l>
     <l n="546">The shining tables , curiously inlaid ,</l>
     <l n="547">Were all in comfortless proud style display 'd ;</l>
     <l n="548">And to the troubled feelings terror gave ,</l>
     <l n="549">That made the once-dear friend the sick'ning slave .</l>
     <l n="550">“ Was he forgotten ? ” Thrice upon his ear</l>
     <l n="551">Struck the loud clock , yet no relief was near :</l>
     <l n="552">Each rattling carriage , and each thundering stroke</l>
     <l n="553">On the loud door , the dream of fancy broke ;</l>
     <l n="554">Oft as a servant chanced the way to come ,</l>
     <l n="555">“ Brings he a message ? ” no ! he passed the room . ’</l>
     <l n="556">At length ‘ tis certain ; “ Sir , you will attend</l>
     <l n="557">At twelve on Thursday ! ” Thus the day had end .</l>
     <l n="558">Vex 'd by these tedious hours of needless pain ,</l>
     <l n="559">John left the noble mansion with disdain ;</l>
     <l n="560">For there was something in that still , cold place ,</l>
     <l n="561">That seemed to threaten and portend disgrace .</l>
     <l n="562">Punctual again the modest rap declared</l>
     <l n="563">The youth attended ; then was all prepared :</l>
     <l n="564">For the same servant , by his lord 's command ,</l>
     <l n="565">A paper offer 'd to his trembling hand :</l>
     <l n="566">“ No more ! ” he cried : “ disdains he to afford</l>
     <l n="567">One kind expression , one consoling word ? ”</l>
     <l n="568">With troubled spirit he began to read</l>
     <l n="569">That “ In the Church my lord could not succeed ; ”</l>
     <l n="570">Who had “ to peers of either kind applied ,</l>
     <l n="571">And was with dignity and grace denied ;</l>
     <l n="572">While his own livings were by men possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="573">Not likely in their chancels yet to rest ;</l>
     <l n="574">And therefore , all things weigh 'd ( as he my lord ,</l>
     <l n="575">Had done maturely , and he pledged his word ) ,</l>
     <l n="576">Wisdom it seem 'd for John to turn his view</l>
     <l n="577">To busier scenes , and bid the Church adieu ! ”</l>
     <l n="578">Here grieved the youth : he felt his father 's pride</l>
     <l n="579">Must with his own be shocked and mortified ;</l>
     <l n="580">But , when he found his future comforts placed</l>
     <l n="581">Where he , alas ! conceived himself disgraced -</l>
     <l n="582">In some appointment on the London quays ,</l>
     <l n="583">He bade farewell to honour and to ease ;</l>
     <l n="584">His spirit fell , and from that hour assured</l>
     <l n="585">How vain his dreams , he suffer 'd and was cured .</l>
     <l n="586">Our Poet hurried on , with wish to fly</l>
     <l n="587">From all mankind , to be conceal 'd , and die .</l>
     <l n="588">Alas ! what hopes , what high romantic views</l>
     <l n="589">Did that one visit to the soul infuse ,</l>
     <l n="590">Which cherished with such love , ‘ twas worse than death to lose .</l>
     <l n="591">Still he would strive , though painful was the strife ,</l>
     <l n="592">To walk in this appointed road of life ;</l>
     <l n="593">On these low duties duteous he would wait ,</l>
     <l n="594">And patient bear the anguish of his fate .</l>
     <l n="595">Thanks to the Patron , but of coldest kind ,</l>
     <l n="596">Express 'd the sadness of the Poet 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="597">Whose heavy hours were pass 'd with busy men ,</l>
     <l n="598">In the dull practice of th ’ official pen ;</l>
     <l n="599">Who to superiors must in time impart ;</l>
     <l n="600">( The custom this ) his progress in their art :</l>
     <l n="601">But so had grief on his perception wrought ,</l>
     <l n="602">That all unheeded were the duties taught ;</l>
     <l n="603">No answers gave he when his trial came ,</l>
     <l n="604">Silent he stood , but suffering without shame ;</l>
     <l n="605">And they observed that words severe or kind</l>
     <l n="606">Made no impression on his wounded mind :</l>
     <l n="607">For all perceived from whence his failure rose ,</l>
     <l n="608">Some grief , whose cause he deign 'd not to disclose .</l>
     <l n="609">A soul averse from scenes and works so new ,</l>
     <l n="610">Fear ever shrinking from the vulgar crew ;</l>
     <l n="611">Distaste for each mechanic law and rule .</l>
     <l n="612">Thoughts of past honour and a patron cool ;</l>
     <l n="613">A grieving parent , and a feeling mind ,</l>
     <l n="614">Timid and ardent , tender and refined :</l>
     <l n="615">These all with mighty force the youth assail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="616">Till his soul fainted , and his reason fail 'd :</l>
     <l n="617">When this was known , and some debate arose ,</l>
     <l n="618">How they who saw it should the fact disclose ,</l>
     <l n="619">He found their purpose , and in terror fled</l>
     <l n="620">From unseen kindness , with mistaken dread .</l>
     <l n="621">Meantime the parent was distress 'd to find</l>
     <l n="622">His son no longer for a priest design 'd ;</l>
     <l n="623">But still he gain 'd some comfort by the news</l>
     <l n="624">Of John 's promotion , though with humbler views ;</l>
     <l n="625">For he conceived that in no distant time</l>
     <l n="626">The boy would learn to scramble and to climb ;</l>
     <l n="627">He little thought his son , his hope and pride ,</l>
     <l n="628">His favour 'd boy , was now a home denied :</l>
     <l n="629">Yes ! while the parent was intent to trace</l>
     <l n="630">How men in office climb from place to place ,</l>
     <l n="631">By day , by night , o'er moor and heath , and hill ,</l>
     <l n="632">Roved the sad youth , with ever-changing will ,</l>
     <l n="633">Of every aid bereft , exposed to every ill .</l>
     <l n="634">Thus as he sat , absorb 'd in all the care</l>
     <l n="635">And all the hope that anxious fathers share ,</l>
     <l n="636">A friend abruptly to his presence brought ,</l>
     <l n="637">With trembling hand , the subject of his thought ;</l>
     <l n="638">Whom he had found afflicted and subdued</l>
     <l n="639">By hunger , sorrow , cold , and solitude .</l>
     <l n="640">Silent he enter 'd the forgotten room ,</l>
     <l n="641">As ghostly forms may be conceived to come ;</l>
     <l n="642">With sorrow-shrunken face and hair upright ,</l>
     <l n="643">He look 'd dismayed , neglect , despair , affright ;</l>
     <l n="644">But dead to comfort , and on misery thrown ,</l>
     <l n="645">His parent 's loss he felt not , nor his own .</l>
     <l n="646">The good man , struck with horror , cried aloud ,</l>
     <l n="647">And drew around him an astonish 'd crowd ;</l>
     <l n="648">The sons and servants to the father ran ,</l>
     <l n="649">To share the feelings of the griev 'd old man .</l>
     <l n="650">“ Our brother , speak ! ” they all exclam 'd “ explain</l>
     <l n="651">Thy grief , thy suffering : ” — but they ask 'd in vain :</l>
     <l n="652">The friend told all he knew ; and all was known ,</l>
     <l n="653">Save the sad causes whence the ills had grown ;</l>
     <l n="654">But , if obscure the cause , they all agreed</l>
     <l n="655">From rest and kindness must the cure proceed :</l>
     <l n="656">And he was cured ; for quiet , love , and care ,</l>
     <l n="657">Strove with the gloom , and broke on the despair ;</l>
     <l n="658">Yet slow their progress , and as vapours move</l>
     <l n="659">Dense and reluctant from the wintry grove ;</l>
     <l n="660">All is confusion , till the morning light</l>
     <l n="661">Gives the dim scene obscurely to the sight ;</l>
     <l n="662">More and yet more defined the trunks appear ,</l>
     <l n="663">Till the wild prospect stands distinct and clear ; -</l>
     <l n="664">So the dark mind of our young poet grew</l>
     <l n="665">Clear and sedate ; the dreadful mist withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="666">And he resembled that bleak wintry scene ,</l>
     <l n="667">Sad , though unclouded ; dismal , though serene .</l>
     <l n="668">At times he utter 'd , “ What a dream was mine !</l>
     <l n="669">And what a prospect ! glorious and divine !</l>
     <l n="670">Oh ! in that room , and on that night to see</l>
     <l n="671">Those looks , that sweetness beaming all on me ;</l>
     <l n="672">That syren-flattery — and to send me then ,</l>
     <l n="673">Hope-raised and soften 'd , to those heartless men ;</l>
     <l n="674">That dark-brow 'd stern Director , pleased to show</l>
     <l n="675">Knowledge of subjects I disdain 'd to know ;</l>
     <l n="676">Cold and controlling — but ‘ tis gone — ‘ tis past ;</l>
     <l n="677">I had my trial , and have peace at last . ”</l>
     <l n="678">Now grew the youth resigned : he bade adieu</l>
     <l n="679">To all that hope , to all that fancy drew ;</l>
     <l n="680">His frame was languid , and the hectic heat</l>
     <l n="681">Flush 'd on his pallid face , and countless beat</l>
     <l n="682">The quick'ning pulse , and faint the limbs that bore</l>
     <l n="683">The slender form that soon would breathe no more .</l>
     <l n="684">Then hope of holy kind the soul sustain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="685">And not a lingering thought of earth remain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="686">Now heaven had all , and he could smile at Love ,</l>
     <l n="687">And the wild sallies of his youth reprove ;</l>
     <l n="688">Then could he dwell upon the tempting days ,</l>
     <l n="689">The proud aspiring thought , the partial praise ;</l>
     <l n="690">Victorious now , his worldly views were closed ,</l>
     <l n="691">And on the bed of death the youth reposed .</l>
     <l n="692">The father grieved — but as the poet 's heart</l>
     <l n="693">Was all unfitted for his earthly part ;</l>
     <l n="694">As , he conceived , some other haughty fair</l>
     <l n="695">Would , had he lived , have led him to despair ;</l>
     <l n="696">As , with this fear , the silent grave shut out</l>
     <l n="697">All feverish hope , and all tormenting doubt ;</l>
     <l n="698">While the strong faith the pious youth possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="699">His hope enlivening gave his sorrows rest ;</l>
     <l n="700">Soothed by these thoughts , he felt a mournful joy</l>
     <l n="701">For his aspiring and devoted boy .</l>
     <l n="702">Meantime the news through various channels spread ,</l>
     <l n="703">The youth , once favour 'd with such praise , was dead :</l>
     <l n="704">“ Emma , ” the lady cried , “ my words attend ,</l>
     <l n="705">Your syren-smiles have kill 'd your humble friend ;</l>
     <l n="706">The hope you raised can now delude no more ,</l>
     <l n="707">Nor charms , that once inspired , can now restore . ”</l>
     <l n="708">Faint was the flush of anger and of shame ,</l>
     <l n="709">That o'er the cheek of conscious beauty came :</l>
     <l n="710">“ You censure not , ” said she , “ the sun 's bright rays ,</l>
     <l n="711">When fools imprudent dare the dangerous gaze ;</l>
     <l n="712">And should a stripling look till he were blind ,</l>
     <l n="713">You would not justly call the light unkind :</l>
     <l n="714">But is he dead ? and am I to suppose</l>
     <l n="715">The power of poison in such looks as those ? ”</l>
     <l n="716">She spoke , and pointing to the mirror , cast</l>
     <l n="717">A pleased gay glance , and curtsied as she pass 'd .</l>
     <l n="718">My Lord , to whom the poet 's fate was told ,</l>
     <l n="719">Was much affected , for a man so cold :</l>
     <l n="720">“ Dead ! ” said his lordship , “ run distracted , mad !</l>
     <l n="721">Upon my soul I 'm sorry for the lad ;</l>
     <l n="722">And now no doubt th ’ obliging world will say</l>
     <l n="723">That my harsh usage help 'd him on his way :</l>
     <l n="724">What ! I suppose , I should have nursed his muse ,</l>
     <l n="725">And with champagne have brighten 'd up his views ;</l>
     <l n="726">Then had he made me famed my whole life long ,</l>
     <l n="727">And stunn 'd my ears with gratitude and song .</l>
     <l n="728">Still should the father bear that I regret</l>

     <l n="1">Grave Jonas Kindred , Sybil Kindred 's sire ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was six feet high , and look 'd six inches higher ;</l>
     <l n="3">Erect , morose , determined , solemn , slow ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who knew the man could never cease to know :</l>
     <l n="5">His faithful spouse , when Jonas was not by ,</l>
     <l n="6">Had a firm presence and a steady eye ;</l>
     <l n="7">But with her husband dropp 'd her look and tone ,</l>
     <l n="8">And Jonas ruled unquestion 'd and alone .</l>
     <l n="9">He read , and oft would quote the sacred words ,</l>
     <l n="10">How pious husbands of their wives were lords ;</l>
     <l n="11">Sarah called Abraham Lord ! and who could be ,</l>
     <l n="12">So Jonas thought , a greater man than he ?</l>
     <l n="13">Himself he view 'd with undisguised respect ,</l>
     <l n="14">And never pardon 'd freedom or neglect .</l>
     <l n="15">They had one daughter , and this favourite child</l>
     <l n="16">Had oft the father of his spleen beguiled ;</l>
     <l n="17">Soothed by attention from her early years ,</l>
     <l n="18">She gained all wishes by her smiles or tears ;</l>
     <l n="19">But Sybil then was in that playful time ,</l>
     <l n="20">When contradiction is not held a crime ;</l>
     <l n="21">When parents yield their children idle praise</l>
     <l n="22">For faults corrected in their after days .</l>
     <l n="23">Peace in the sober house of Jonas dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="24">Where each his duty and his station felt :</l>
     <l n="25">Yet not that peace some favour 'd mortals find ,</l>
     <l n="26">In equal views and harmony of mind ;</l>
     <l n="27">Not the soft peace that blesses those who love ,</l>
     <l n="28">Where all with one consent in union move ;</l>
     <l n="29">But it was that which one superior will</l>
     <l n="30">Commands , by making all inferiors still ;</l>
     <l n="31">Who bids all murmurs , all objections , cease ,</l>
     <l n="32">And with imperious voice announces — Peace !</l>
     <l n="33">They were , to wit , a remnant of that crew ,</l>
     <l n="34">Who , as their foes maintain , their Sovereign slew ;</l>
     <l n="35">An independent race , precise , correct ,</l>
     <l n="36">Who ever married in the kindred sect :</l>
     <l n="37">No son or daughter of their order wed</l>
     <l n="38">A friend to England 's king who lost his head ;</l>
     <l n="39">Cromwell was still their Saint , and when they met ,</l>
     <l n="40">They mourn 'd that Saints were not our rulers yet .</l>
     <l n="41">Fix 'd were their habits ; they arose betimes ,</l>
     <l n="42">Then pray 'd their hour , and sang their party-rhymes :</l>
     <l n="43">Their meals were plenteous , regular and plain ;</l>
     <l n="44">The trade of Jonas brought him constant gain ;</l>
     <l n="45">Vender of hops and malt , of coals and corn -</l>
     <l n="46">And , like his father , he was merchant born :</l>
     <l n="47">Neat was their house ; each table , chair , and stool ,</l>
     <l n="48">Stood in its place , or moving moved by rule ;</l>
     <l n="49">No lively print or picture graced the room ;</l>
     <l n="50">A plain brown paper lent its decent gloom ;</l>
     <l n="51">But here the eye , in glancing round , survey 'd</l>
     <l n="52">A small recess that seem 'd for china made ;</l>
     <l n="53">Such pleasing pictures seem 'd this pencill 'd ware ,</l>
     <l n="54">That few would search for nobler objects there -</l>
     <l n="55">Yet , turn 'd by chosen friends , and there appear 'd</l>
     <l n="56">His stern , strong features , whom they all revered ;</l>
     <l n="57">For there in lofty air was seen to stand</l>
     <l n="58">The bold Protector of the conquer 'd land ;</l>
     <l n="59">Drawn in that look with which he wept and swore ,</l>
     <l n="60">Turn 'd out the Members , and made fast the door ,</l>
     <l n="61">Ridding the House of every knave and drone ,</l>
     <l n="62">Forced , though it grieved his soul , to rule alone .</l>
     <l n="63">The stern still smile each friend approving gave ,</l>
     <l n="64">Then turn 'd the view , and all again were grave .</l>
     <l n="65">There stood a clock , though small the owner 's need ,</l>
     <l n="66">For habit told when all things should proceed ;</l>
     <l n="67">Few their amusements , but when friends appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="68">They with the world 's distress their spirits cheer 'd ;</l>
     <l n="69">The nation 's guilt , that would not long endure</l>
     <l n="70">The reign of men so modest and so pure :</l>
     <l n="71">Their town was large , and seldom pass 'd a day</l>
     <l n="72">But some had fail 'd , and others gone astray ;</l>
     <l n="73">Clerks had absconded , wives eloped , girls flown</l>
     <l n="74">To Gretna-Green , or sons rebellious grown ;</l>
     <l n="75">Quarrels and fires arose ;— and it was plain</l>
     <l n="76">The times were bad ; the Saints had ceased to reign !</l>
     <l n="77">A few yet lived , to languish and to mourn</l>
     <l n="78">For good old manners never to return .</l>
     <l n="79">Jonas had sisters , and of these was one</l>
     <l n="80">Who lost a husband and an only son :</l>
     <l n="81">Twelve months her sables she in sorrow wore ,</l>
     <l n="82">And mourn 'd so long that she could mourn no more .</l>
     <l n="83">Distant from Jonas , and from all her race ,</l>
     <l n="84">She now resided in a lively place ;</l>
     <l n="85">There , by the sect unseen , at whist she play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="86">Nor was of churchman or their church afraid :</l>
     <l n="87">If much of this the graver brother heard ,</l>
     <l n="88">He something censured , but he little fear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="89">He knew her rich and frugal ; for the rest ,</l>
     <l n="90">He felt no care , or , if he felt , suppress 'd :</l>
     <l n="91">Nor for companion when she ask 'd her Niece ,</l>
     <l n="92">Had he suspicions that disturb 'd his peace ;</l>
     <l n="93">Frugal and rich , these virtues as a charm</l>
     <l n="94">Preserved the thoughtful man from all alarm ;</l>
     <l n="95">An infant yet , she soon would home return ,</l>
     <l n="96">Nor stay the manners of the world to learn ;</l>
     <l n="97">Meantime his boys would all his care engross ,</l>
     <l n="98">And be his comforts if he felt the loss .</l>
     <l n="99">The sprightly Sybil , pleased and unconfined ,</l>
     <l n="100">Felt the pure pleasure of the op'ning mind :</l>
     <l n="101">All here was gay and cheerful — all at home</l>
     <l n="102">Unvaried quiet and unruffled gloom :</l>
     <l n="103">There were no changes , and amusements few ; -</l>
     <l n="104">Here all was varied , wonderful , and new ;</l>
     <l n="105">There were plain meals , plain dresses , and grave looks -</l>
     <l n="106">Here , gay companions and amusing books ;</l>
     <l n="107">And the young Beauty soon began to taste</l>
     <l n="108">The light vocations of the scene she graced .</l>
     <l n="109">A man of business feels it as a crime</l>
     <l n="110">On calls domestic to consume his time ;</l>
     <l n="111">Yet this grave man had not so cold a heart ,</l>
     <l n="112">But with his daughter he was grieved to part :</l>
     <l n="113">And he demanded that in every year</l>
     <l n="114">The Aunt and Niece should at his house appear .</l>
     <l n="115">“ Yes ! we must go , my child , and by our dress</l>
     <l n="116">A grave conformity of mind express ;</l>
     <l n="117">Must sing at meeting , and from cards refrain ,</l>
     <l n="118">The more t'enjoy when we return again . ”</l>
     <l n="119">Thus spake the Aunt , and the discerning child</l>
     <l n="120">Was pleased to learn how fathers are beguiled .</l>
     <l n="121">Her artful part the young dissembler took ,</l>
     <l n="122">And from the matron caught th ’ approving look :</l>
     <l n="123">When thrice the friends had met , excuse was sent</l>
     <l n="124">For more delay , and Jonas was content ;</l>
     <l n="125">Till a tall maiden by her sire was seen ,</l>
     <l n="126">In all the bloom and beauty of sixteen ;</l>
     <l n="127">He gazed admiring ;— she , with visage prim ,</l>
     <l n="128">Glanced an arch look of gravity on him ;</l>
     <l n="129">For she was gay at heart , but wore disguise ,</l>
     <l n="130">And stood a vestal in her father 's eyes :</l>
     <l n="131">Pure , pensive , simple , sad ; the damsel 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="132">When Jonas praised , reproved her for the part .</l>
     <l n="133">For Sybil , fond of pleasure , gay and light ,</l>
     <l n="134">Had still a secret bias to the right ;</l>
     <l n="135">Vain as she was — and flattery made her vain -</l>
     <l n="136">Her simulation gave her bosom pain .</l>
     <l n="137">Again return 'd , the Matron and the Niece</l>
     <l n="138">Found the late quiet gave their joy increase ;</l>
     <l n="139">The aunt infirm , no more her visits paid ,</l>
     <l n="140">But still with her sojourn 'd the favourite maid .</l>
     <l n="141">Letters were sent when franks could be procured ,</l>
     <l n="142">And when they could not , silence was endured ;</l>
     <l n="143">All were in health , and if they older grew ,</l>
     <l n="144">It seem 'd a fact that none among them knew ;</l>
     <l n="145">The aunt and niece still led a pleasant life ,</l>
     <l n="146">And quiet days had Jonas and his wife .</l>
     <l n="147">Near him a Widow dwelt of worthy fame ,</l>
     <l n="148">Like his her manners , and her creed the same ;</l>
     <l n="149">The wealth her husband left , her care retain 'd</l>
     <l n="150">For one tall Youth , and widow she remain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="151">His love respectful all her care repaid ,</l>
     <l n="152">Her wishes watch 'd , and her commands obey 'd .</l>
     <l n="153">Sober he was and grave from early youth ,</l>
     <l n="154">Mindful of forms , but more intent on truth :</l>
     <l n="155">In a light drab he uniformly dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="156">And look serene th ’ unruffled mind express 'd ;</l>
     <l n="157">A hat with ample verge his brows o'erspread ,</l>
     <l n="158">And his brown locks curl 'd graceful on his head ;</l>
     <l n="159">Yet might observers in his speaking eye</l>
     <l n="160">Some observation , some acuteness spy ;</l>
     <l n="161">The friendly thought it keen , the treacherous deem 'd it sly .</l>
     <l n="162">Yet not a crime could foe or friend detect ,</l>
     <l n="163">His actions all were , like his speech , correct ;</l>
     <l n="164">And they who jested on a mind so sound ,</l>
     <l n="165">Upon his virtues must their laughter found ;</l>
     <l n="166">Chaste , sober , solemn , and devout they named</l>
     <l n="167">Him who was thus , and not of this ashamed .</l>
     <l n="168">Such were the virtues Jonas found in one</l>
     <l n="169">In whom he warmly wish 'd to find a son :</l>
     <l n="170">Three years had pass 'd since he had Sybil seen ;</l>
     <l n="171">But she was doubtless what she once had been ,</l>
     <l n="172">Lovely and mild , obedient and discreet ;</l>
     <l n="173">The pair must love whenever they should meet ;</l>
     <l n="174">Then ere the widow or her son should choose</l>
     <l n="175">Some happier maid , he would explain his views :</l>
     <l n="176">Now she , like him , was politic and shrewd ,</l>
     <l n="177">With strong desire of lawful gain embued ;</l>
     <l n="178">To all he said , she bow 'd with much respect ,</l>
     <l n="179">Pleased to comply , yet seeming to reject ;</l>
     <l n="180">Cool and yet eager , each admired the strength</l>
     <l n="181">Of the opponent , and agreed at length :</l>
     <l n="182">As a drawn battle shows to each a force ,</l>
     <l n="183">Powerful as his , he honours it of course ;</l>
     <l n="184">So in these neighbours , each the power discern 'd ,</l>
     <l n="185">And gave the praise that was to each return 'd .</l>
     <l n="186">Jonas now ask 'd his daughter — and the Aunt ,</l>
     <l n="187">Though loth to lose her , was obliged to grant : -</l>
     <l n="188">But would not Sybil to the matron cling ,</l>
     <l n="189">And fear to leave the shelter of her wing ?</l>
     <l n="190">No ! in the young there lives a love of change ,</l>
     <l n="191">And to the easy they prefer the strange !</l>
     <l n="192">Then , too , the joys she once pursued with zeal ,</l>
     <l n="193">From whist and visits sprung , she ceased to feel :</l>
     <l n="194">When with the matrons Sybil first sat down ,</l>
     <l n="195">To cut for partners and to stake her crown ,</l>
     <l n="196">This to the youthful maid preferment seem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="197">Who thought what woman she was then esteem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="198">But in few years , when she perceived , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="199">The real woman to the girl succeed ,</l>
     <l n="200">No longer tricks and honours fill 'd her mind ,</l>
     <l n="201">But other feelings , not so well defined ;</l>
     <l n="202">She then reluctant grew , and thought it hard</l>
     <l n="203">To sit and ponder o'er an ugly card ;</l>
     <l n="204">Rather the nut-tree shade the nymph preferr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="205">Pleased with the pensive gloom and evening bird ;</l>
     <l n="206">Thither , from company retired , she took</l>
     <l n="207">The silent walk , or read the fav'rite book .</l>
     <l n="208">The father 's letter , sudden , short , and kind ,</l>
     <l n="209">Awaked her wonder , and disturb 'd her mind ;</l>
     <l n="210">She found new dreams upon her fancy seize ,</l>
     <l n="211">Wild roving thoughts and endless reveries .</l>
     <l n="212">The parting came ;— and when the Aunt perceived</l>
     <l n="213">The tears of Sybil , and how much she grieved -</l>
     <l n="214">To love for her that tender grief she laid ,</l>
     <l n="215">That various , soft , contending passions made .</l>
     <l n="216">When Sybil rested in her father 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="217">His pride exulted in a daughter 's charms ;</l>
     <l n="218">A maid accomplish 'd he was pleased to find ,</l>
     <l n="219">Nor seem 'd the form more lovely than the mind :</l>
     <l n="220">But when the fit of pride and fondness fled ,</l>
     <l n="221">He saw his judgment by his hopes misled ;</l>
     <l n="222">High were the lady 's spirits , far more free</l>
     <l n="223">Her mode of speaking than a maid 's should be ;</l>
     <l n="224">Too much , as Jonas thought , she seem 'd to know ,</l>
     <l n="225">And all her knowledge was disposed to show ;</l>
     <l n="226">“ Too gay her dress , like theirs who idly dote</l>
     <l n="227">On a young coxcomb or a coxcomb 's coat ;</l>
     <l n="228">In foolish spirits when our friends appear ,</l>
     <l n="229">And vainly grave when not a man is near . ”</l>
     <l n="230">Thus Jonas , adding to his sorrow blame ,</l>
     <l n="231">And terms disdainful to a Sister 's name :</l>
     <l n="232">“ The sinful wretch has by her arts denied</l>
     <l n="233">The ductile spirit of my darling child . ”</l>
     <l n="234">“ The maid is virtuous , ” said the dame — Quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="235">“ Let her give proof , by acting virtuously :</l>
     <l n="236">Is it in gaping when the Elders pray ?</l>
     <l n="237">In reading nonsense half a summer 's day ?</l>
     <l n="238">In those mock forms that she delights to trace ,</l>
     <l n="239">Or her loud laughs in Hezekiah 's face ?</l>
     <l n="240">She — O Susannah !— to the world belongs ;</l>
     <l n="241">She loves the follies of its idle throngs ,</l>
     <l n="242">And reads soft tales of love , and sings love 's soft'ning songs .</l>
     <l n="243">But , as our friend is yet delay 'd in town ,</l>
     <l n="244">We must prepare her till the Youth comes down :</l>
     <l n="245">You shall advise the maiden ; I will threat ;</l>
     <l n="246">Her fears and hopes may yield us comfort yet . ”</l>
     <l n="247">Now the grave father took the lass aside ,</l>
     <l n="248">Demanding sternly , “ Wilt thou be a bride ? ”</l>
     <l n="249">She answer 'd , calling up an air sedate ,</l>
     <l n="250">“ I have not vow 'd against the holy state . ”</l>
     <l n="251">“ No folly , Sybil , ” said the parent ; “ know</l>
     <l n="252">What to their parents virtuous maidens owe :</l>
     <l n="253">A worthy , wealthy youth , whom I approve ,</l>
     <l n="254">Must thou prepare to honour and to love .</l>
     <l n="255">Formal to thee his air and dress may seem ,</l>
     <l n="256">But the good youth is worthy of esteem :</l>
     <l n="257">Shouldst thou with rudeness treat him ; of disdain</l>
     <l n="258">Should he with justice or of slight complain ,</l>
     <l n="259">Or of one taunting speech give certain proof ,</l>
     <l n="260">Girl ! I reject thee from my sober roof . ”</l>
     <l n="261">“ My aunt , ” said Sybil , ” will with pride protect</l>
     <l n="262">One whom a father can for this reject ;</l>
     <l n="263">Nor shall a formal , rigid , soul-less boy</l>
     <l n="264">My manners alter , or my views destroy ! ”</l>
     <l n="265">Jonas then lifted up his hands on high ,</l>
     <l n="266">And , utt'ring something ‘ twixt a groan and sigh ,</l>
     <l n="267">Left the determined maid , her doubtful mother by .</l>
     <l n="268">“ Hear me , ” she said ; “ incline thy heart , my child ,</l>
     <l n="269">And fix thy fancy on a man so mild :</l>
     <l n="270">Thy father , Sybil , never could be moved</l>
     <l n="271">By one who loved him , or by one he loved .</l>
     <l n="272">Union like ours is but a bargain made</l>
     <l n="273">By slave and tyrant — he will be obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="274">Then calls the quiet , comfort — but thy Youth</l>
     <l n="275">Is mild by nature , and as frank as truth . ”</l>
     <l n="276">“ But will he love ? ” said Sybil ; “ I am told</l>
     <l n="277">That these mild creatures are by nature cold . ”</l>
     <l n="278">“ Alas ! ” the matron answer 'd , “ much I dread</l>
     <l n="279">That dangerous love by which the young are led !</l>
     <l n="280">That love is earthy ; you the creature prize ,</l>
     <l n="281">And trust your feelings and believe your eyes :</l>
     <l n="282">Can eyes and feelings inward worth descry ?</l>
     <l n="283">No ! my fair daughter , on our choice rely !</l>
     <l n="284">Your love , like that display 'd upon the stage ,</l>
     <l n="285">Indulged is folly , and opposed is rage ; -</l>
     <l n="286">More prudent love our sober couples show ,</l>
     <l n="287">All that to mortal beings , mortals owe ;</l>
     <l n="288">All flesh is grass — before you give a heart ,</l>
     <l n="289">Remember , Sybil , that in death you part ;</l>
     <l n="290">And should your husband die before your love ,</l>
     <l n="291">What needless anguish must a widow prove !</l>
     <l n="292">No ! my fair child , let all such visions cease ;</l>
     <l n="293">Yield but esteem , and only try for peace . ”</l>
     <l n="294">“ I must be loved , ” said Sybil ; “ I must see</l>
     <l n="295">The man in terrors who aspires to me ;</l>
     <l n="296">At my forbidding frown his heart must ache ,</l>
     <l n="297">His tongue must falter , and his frame must shake :</l>
     <l n="298">And if I grant him at my feet to kneel ,</l>
     <l n="299">What trembling , fearful pleasure must he feel ;</l>
     <l n="300">Nay , such the raptures that my smiles inspire ,</l>
     <l n="301">That reason 's self must for a time retire . ”</l>
     <l n="302">“ Alas ! for good Josiah , ” said the dame ,</l>
     <l n="303">“ These wicked thoughts would fill his soul with shame ;</l>
     <l n="304">He kneel and tremble at a thing of dust !</l>
     <l n="305">He cannot , child : ” — the Child replied , “ He must . ”</l>
     <l n="306">They ceased : the matron left her with a frown ;</l>
     <l n="307">So Jonas met her when the Youth came down :</l>
     <l n="308">“ Behold , ” said he , “ thy future spouse attends ;</l>
     <l n="309">Receive him , daughter , as the best of friends ;</l>
     <l n="310">Observe , respect him — humble be each word ,</l>
     <l n="311">That welcomes home thy husband and thy lord . ”</l>
     <l n="312">Forewarn 'd , thought Sybil , with a bitter smile ,</l>
     <l n="313">I shall prepare my manner and my style .</l>
     <l n="314">Ere yet Josiah enter 'd on his task ,</l>
     <l n="315">The father met him — “ Deign to wear a mask</l>
     <l n="316">A few dull days , Josiah — but a few -</l>
     <l n="317">It is our duty , and the sex 's due ;</l>
     <l n="318">I wore it once , and every grateful wife</l>
     <l n="319">Repays it with obedience through her life :</l>
     <l n="320">Have no regard to Sybil 's dress , have none</l>
     <l n="321">To her pert language , to her flippant tone :</l>
     <l n="322">Henceforward thou shalt rule unquestion 'd and alone ;</l>
     <l n="323">And she thy pleasure in thy looks shall seek -</l>
     <l n="324">How she shall dress , and whether she may speak . ”</l>
     <l n="325">A sober smile returned the Youth , and said ,</l>
     <l n="326">“ Can I cause fear , who am myself afraid ? ”</l>
     <l n="327">Sybil , meantime , sat thoughtful in her room ,</l>
     <l n="328">And often wonder 'd — “ Will the creature come ?</l>
     <l n="329">Nothing shall tempt , shall force me to bestow</l>
     <l n="330">My hand upon him ,— yet I wish to know . ”</l>
     <l n="331">The door unclosed , and she beheld her sire</l>
     <l n="332">Lead in the Youth , then hasten to retire ;</l>
     <l n="333">“ Daughter , my friend — my daughter , friend , ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="334">And gave a meaning look , and stepp 'd aside :</l>
     <l n="335">That look contained a mingled threat and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="336">“ Do take him , child ,— offend him if you dare . ”</l>
     <l n="337">The couple gazed — were silent , and the maid</l>
     <l n="338">Look 'd in his face , to make the man afraid ;</l>
     <l n="339">The man , unmoved , upon the maiden cast</l>
     <l n="340">A steady view — so salutation pass 'd :</l>
     <l n="341">But in this instant Sybil 's eye had seen</l>
     <l n="342">The tall fair person , and the still staid mien ;</l>
     <l n="343">The glow that temp'rance o'er the cheek had spread ,</l>
     <l n="344">Where the soft down half veil 'd the purest red ;</l>
     <l n="345">And the serene deportment that proclaim 'd</l>
     <l n="346">A heart unspotted , and a life unblamed :</l>
     <l n="347">But then with these she saw attire too plain ,</l>
     <l n="348">The pale brown coat , though worn without a stain ;</l>
     <l n="349">The formal air , and something of the pride</l>
     <l n="350">That indicates the wealth it seems to hide ;</l>
     <l n="351">And looks that were not , she conceived , exempt</l>
     <l n="352">From a proud pity , or a sly contempt .</l>
     <l n="353">Josiah 's eyes had their employment too ,</l>
     <l n="354">Engaged and soften 'd by so bright a view ;</l>
     <l n="355">A fair and meaning face , an eye of fire ,</l>
     <l n="356">That check 'd the bold , and made the free retire :</l>
     <l n="357">But then with these he marked the studied dress</l>
     <l n="358">And lofty air , that scorn or pride express ;</l>
     <l n="359">With that insidious look , that seem 'd to hide</l>
     <l n="360">In an affected smile the scorn and pride ;</l>
     <l n="361">And if his mind the virgin 's meaning caught ,</l>
     <l n="362">He saw a foe with treacherous purpose fraught -</l>
     <l n="363">Captive the heart to take , and to reject it , caught .</l>
     <l n="364">Silent they sat — thought Sybil , that he seeks</l>
     <l n="365">Something , no doubt ; I wonder if he speaks :</l>
     <l n="366">Scarcely she wonder 'd , when these accents fell</l>
     <l n="367">Slow in her ear — “ Fair maiden , art thou well ? ”</l>
     <l n="368">“ Art thou physician ? ” she replied ; “ my hand ,</l>
     <l n="369">My pulse , at least , shall be at thy command . ”</l>
     <l n="370">She said — and saw , surprised , Josiah kneel ,</l>
     <l n="371">And gave his lips the offer 'd pulse to feel ;</l>
     <l n="372">The rosy colour rising in her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="373">Seem 'd that surprise unmix 'd with wrath to speak ;</l>
     <l n="374">Then sternness she assumed , and — “ Doctor , tell ;</l>
     <l n="375">Thy words cannot alarm me — am I well ? ”</l>
     <l n="376">“ Thou art , ” said he ; “ and yet thy dress so light ,</l>
     <l n="377">I do conceive , some danger must excite : ”</l>
     <l n="378">“ In whom ? ” said Sybil , with a look demure :</l>
     <l n="379">“ In more , ” said he , “ than I expect to cure ; -</l>
     <l n="380">I , in thy light luxuriant robe behold</l>
     <l n="381">Want and excess , abounding and yet cold ;</l>
     <l n="382">Here needed , there display 'd , in many a wanton fold ;</l>
     <l n="383">Both health and beauty , learned authors show ,</l>
     <l n="384">From a just medium in our clothing flow . ”</l>
     <l n="385">“ Proceed , good doctor ; if so great my need ,</l>
     <l n="386">What is thy fee ? Good doctor ! pray proceed . ”</l>
     <l n="387">“ Large is my fee , fair lady , but I take</l>
     <l n="388">None till some progress in my cure I make :</l>
     <l n="389">Thou hast disease , fair maiden ; thou art vain ;</l>
     <l n="390">Within that face sit insult and disdain ;</l>
     <l n="391">Thou art enamour 'd of thyself ; my art</l>
     <l n="392">Can see the naughty malice of thy heart :</l>
     <l n="393">With a strong pleasure would thy bosom move ,</l>
     <l n="394">Were I to own thy power , and ask thy love ;</l>
     <l n="395">And such thy beauty , damsel , that I might ,</l>
     <l n="396">But for thy pride , feel danger in thy sight ,</l>
     <l n="397">And lose my present peace in dreams of vain delight . ”</l>
     <l n="398">“ And can thy patients , ” said the nymph “ endure</l>
     <l n="399">Physic like this ? and will it work a cure ? ”</l>
     <l n="400">“ Such is my hope , fair damsel ; thou , I find ,</l>
     <l n="401">Hast the true tokens of a noble mind ;</l>
     <l n="402">But the world wins thee , Sybil , and thy joys</l>
     <l n="403">Are placed in trifles , fashions , follies , toys ;</l>
     <l n="404">Thou hast sought pleasure in the world around ,</l>
     <l n="405">That in thine own pure bosom should be found ;</l>
     <l n="406">Did all that world admire thee , praise and love ,</l>
     <l n="407">Could it the least of nature 's pains remove ?</l>
     <l n="408">Could it for errors , follies , sins atone ,</l>
     <l n="409">Or give the comfort , thoughtful and alone ?</l>
     <l n="410">It has , believe me , maid , no power to charm</l>
     <l n="411">Thy soul from sorrow , or thy flesh from harm :</l>
     <l n="412">Turn then , fair creature , from a world of sin ,</l>
     <l n="413">And seek the jewel happiness within . ”</l>
     <l n="414">“ Speak'st thou at meeting ? ” said the nymph ; “ thy speech</l>
     <l n="415">Is that of mortal very prone to teach ;</l>
     <l n="416">But wouldst thou , doctor , from the patient learn</l>
     <l n="417">Thine own disease ?— the cure is thy concern . ”</l>
     <l n="418">“ Yea , with good will . ” — “ Then know ‘ tis thy complaint ,</l>
     <l n="419">That , for a sinner , thou'rt too much a saint ;</l>
     <l n="420">Hast too much show of the sedate and pure ,</l>
     <l n="421">And without cause art formal and demure :</l>
     <l n="422">This makes a man unsocial , unpolite ;</l>
     <l n="423">Odious when wrong , and insolent if right .</l>
     <l n="424">Thou mayst be good , but why should goodness be</l>
     <l n="425">Wrapt in a garb of such formality ?</l>
     <l n="426">Thy person well might please a damsel 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="427">In decent habit with a scarlet dye ;</l>
     <l n="428">But , jest apart — what virtue canst thou trace</l>
     <l n="429">In that broad brim that hides thy sober face ?</l>
     <l n="430">Does that long-skirted drab , that over-nice</l>
     <l n="431">And formal clothing , prove a scorn of vice ?</l>
     <l n="432">Then for thine accent — what in sound can be</l>
     <l n="433">So void of grace as dull monotony ?</l>
     <l n="434">Love has a thousand varied notes to move</l>
     <l n="435">The human heart : — thou mayest not speak of love</l>
     <l n="436">Till thou hast cast thy formal ways aside ,</l>
     <l n="437">And those becoming youth and nature tried :</l>
     <l n="438">Not till exterior freedom , spirit , ease ,</l>
     <l n="439">Prove it thy study and delight to please ;</l>
     <l n="440">Not till these follies meet thy just disdain ,</l>
     <l n="441">While yet thy virtues and thy worth remain . ”</l>
     <l n="442">“ This is severe !— Oh ! maiden wilt not thou</l>
     <l n="443">Something for habits , manners , modes , allow ? ” -</l>
     <l n="444">“ Yes ! but allowing much , I much require ,</l>
     <l n="445">In my behalf , for manners , modes , attire ! ”</l>
     <l n="446">“ True , lovely Sybil ; and , this point agreed ,</l>
     <l n="447">Let me to those of greater weight proceed :</l>
     <l n="448">Thy father ! ” — “ Nay , ” she quickly interposed ,</l>
     <l n="449">“ Good doctor , here our conference is closed ! ”</l>
     <l n="450">Then left the Youth , who , lost in his retreat ,</l>
     <l n="451">Pass 'd the good matron on her garden-seat ;</l>
     <l n="452">His looks were troubled , and his air , once mild</l>
     <l n="453">And calm , was hurried : — “ My audacious child ! ”</l>
     <l n="454">Exclaim 'd the dame , “ I read what she has done</l>
     <l n="455">In thy displeasure — Ah ! the thoughtless one :</l>
     <l n="456">But yet , Josiah , to my stern good man</l>
     <l n="457">Speak of the maid as mildly as you can :</l>
     <l n="458">Can you not seem to woo a little while</l>
     <l n="459">The daughter 's will , the father to beguile ?</l>
     <l n="460">So that his wrath in time may wear away ;</l>
     <l n="461">Will you preserve our peace , Josiah ? say . ”</l>
     <l n="462">“ Yes ! my good neighbour , ” said the gentle youth ,</l>
     <l n="463">“ Rely securely on my care and truth ;</l>
     <l n="464">And should thy comfort with my efforts cease ,</l>
     <l n="465">And only then ,— perpetual is thy peace . ”</l>
     <l n="466">The dame had doubts : she well his virtues knew ,</l>
     <l n="467">His deeds were friendly , and his words were true :</l>
     <l n="468">“ But to address this vixen is a task</l>
     <l n="469">He is ashamed to take , and I to ask . ”</l>
     <l n="470">Soon as the father from Josiah learn 'd</l>
     <l n="471">What pass 'd with Sybil , he the truth discern 'd .</l>
     <l n="472">“ He loves , ” the man exclaim 'd , “ he loves , ‘ tis plain ,</l>
     <l n="473">The thoughtless girl , and shall he love in vain ?</l>
     <l n="474">She may be stubborn , but she shall be tried ,</l>
     <l n="475">Born as she is of wilfulness and pride . ”</l>
     <l n="476">With anger fraught , but willing to persuade ,</l>
     <l n="477">The wrathful father met the smiling maid :</l>
     <l n="478">“ Sybil , ” said he , “ I long , and yet I dread</l>
     <l n="479">To know thy conduct — hath Josiah fled ?</l>
     <l n="480">And , grieved and fretted by thy scornful air ,</l>
     <l n="481">For his lost peace , betaken him to prayer ?</l>
     <l n="482">Couldst thou his pure and modest mind distress</l>
     <l n="483">By vile remarks upon his speech , address ,</l>
     <l n="484">Attire , and voice ? ” — “ All this I must confess . ”</l>
     <l n="485">“ Unhappy child ! what labour will it cost</l>
     <l n="486">To win him back ! ” — “ I do not think him lost . ”</l>
     <l n="487">“ Courts he then ( trifler ! ) insult and disdain ? ” -</l>
     <l n="488">“ No ; but from these he courts me to refrain . ”</l>
     <l n="489">“ Then hear me , Sybil : should Josiah leave</l>
     <l n="490">Thy father 's house ? ” — “ My father 's child would grieve . ”</l>
     <l n="491">“ That is of grace , and if he come again</l>
     <l n="492">To speak of love ? ” — “ I might from grief refrain . ”</l>
     <l n="493">“ Then wilt thou , daughter , our design embrace ? ” -</l>
     <l n="494">“ Can I resist it , if it be of Grace ? ”</l>
     <l n="495">“ Dear child in three plain words thy mind express :</l>
     <l n="496">Wilt thou have this good youth ? ” — “ Dear Father ! yes . ”</l>

     <l n="16">To Farmer Moss , in Langar Vale , came down ,</l>
     <l n="17">His only daughter , from her school in town ;</l>
     <l n="18">A tender , timid maid ! who knew not how</l>
     <l n="19">To pass a pig-sty , or to face a cow :</l>
     <l n="20">Smiling she came , with petty talents graced ,</l>
     <l n="21">A fair complexion , and a slender waist .</l>
     <l n="22">Used to spare meals , disposed in manner pure ,</l>
     <l n="23">Her father 's kitchen she could ill endure :</l>
     <l n="24">Where by the steaming beef he hungry sat ,</l>
     <l n="25">And laid at once a pound upon his plate ;</l>
     <l n="26">Hot from the field , her eager brother seized</l>
     <l n="27">An equal part , and hunger 's rage appeased ;</l>
     <l n="28">The air surcharged with moisture , flagg 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="29">And the offended damsel sigh 'd and frown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="30">The swelling fat in lumps conglomerate laid ,</l>
     <l n="31">And fancy 's sickness seized the loathing maid :</l>
     <l n="32">But when the men beside their station took ,</l>
     <l n="33">The maidens with them , and with these the cook ;</l>
     <l n="34">When one huge wooden bowl before them stood ,</l>
     <l n="35">Fill 'd with huge balls of farinaceous food ;</l>
     <l n="36">With bacon , mass saline , where never lean</l>
     <l n="37">Beneath the brown and bristly rind was seen ;</l>
     <l n="38">When from a single horn the party drew</l>
     <l n="39">Their copious draughts of heavy ale and new ;</l>
     <l n="40">When the coarse cloth she saw , with many a stain</l>
     <l n="41">Soil 'd by rude hinds who cut and came again -</l>
     <l n="42">She could not breathe ; but with a heavy sigh ,</l>
     <l n="43">Rein 'd the fair neck , and shut th ’ offended eye ;</l>
     <l n="44">She minced the sanguine flesh in frustums fine ,</l>
     <l n="45">And wonder 'd much to see the creatures dine ;</l>
     <l n="46">When she resolved her father 's heart to move ,</l>
     <l n="47">If hearts of farmers were alive to love .</l>
     <l n="48">She now entreated by herself to sit</l>
     <l n="49">In the small parlour , if papa thought fit ,</l>
     <l n="50">And there to dine , to read , to work alone -</l>
     <l n="51">“ No ! ” said the Farmer in an angry tone ;</l>
     <l n="52">“ These are your school-taught airs ; your mother 's pride</l>
     <l n="53">Would send you there ; but I am now your guide . -</l>
     <l n="54">Arise betimes , our early meal prepare ,</l>
     <l n="55">And , this despatch 'd , let business be your care ;</l>
     <l n="56">Look to the lasses , let there not be one</l>
     <l n="57">Who lacks attention , till her tasks be done ;</l>
     <l n="58">In every household work your portion take ,</l>
     <l n="59">And what you make not , see that others make :</l>
     <l n="60">At leisure times attend the wheel , and see</l>
     <l n="61">The whit'ning web besprinkled on the lea ;</l>
     <l n="62">When thus employ 'd , should our young neighbours view ,</l>
     <l n="63">A useful lass ,— you may have more to do . ”</l>
     <l n="64">Dreadful were these commands ; but worse than these</l>
     <l n="65">The parting hint — a Farmer could not please :</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Tis true she had without abhorrence seen</l>
     <l n="67">Young Harry Carr , when he was smart and clean :</l>
     <l n="68">But , to be married — be a farmer 's wife -</l>
     <l n="69">A slave ! a drudge !— she could not for her life .</l>
     <l n="70">With swimming eyes the fretful nymph withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="71">And , deeply sighing , to her chamber flew ;</l>
     <l n="72">There on her knees , to Heaven she grieving pray 'd</l>
     <l n="73">For change of prospect to a tortured maid .</l>
     <l n="74">Harry , a youth whose late-departed sire</l>
     <l n="75">Had left him all industrious men require ,</l>
     <l n="76">Saw the pale Beauty ,— and her shape and air</l>
     <l n="77">Engaged him much , and yet he must forbear :</l>
     <l n="78">“ For my small farm what can the damsel do ? ”</l>
     <l n="79">He said ,— then stopp 'd to take another view :</l>
     <l n="80">“ Pity so sweet a lass will nothing learn</l>
     <l n="81">Of household cares ,— for what can beauty earn</l>
     <l n="82">By those small arts which they at school attain ,</l>
     <l n="83">That keep them useless , and yet make them vain ? ”</l>
     <l n="84">This luckless Damsel look 'd the village round ,</l>
     <l n="85">To find a friend , and one was quickly found :</l>
     <l n="86">A pensive Widow , whose mild air and dress</l>
     <l n="87">Pleased the sad nymph , who wish 'd her soul 's distress</l>
     <l n="88">To one so seeming kind , confiding , to confess .</l>
     <l n="89">“ What Lady that ? ” the anxious lass inquired ,</l>
     <l n="90">Who then beheld the one she most admired :</l>
     <l n="91">“ Here , ” said the Brother , “ are no ladies seen -</l>
     <l n="92">That is a widow dwelling on the Green ;</l>
     <l n="93">A dainty dame , who can but barely live</l>
     <l n="94">On her poor pittance , yet contrives to give ;</l>
     <l n="95">She happier days has known , but seems at ease ,</l>
     <l n="96">And you may call her lady if you please :</l>
     <l n="97">But if you wish , good sister , to improve ,</l>
     <l n="98">You shall see twenty better worth your love . ”</l>
     <l n="99">These Nancy met ; but , spite of all they taught ,</l>
     <l n="100">This useless Widow was the one she sought :</l>
     <l n="101">The father growl 'd ; but said he knew no harm</l>
     <l n="102">In such connexion that could give alarm ;</l>
     <l n="103">“ And if we thwart the trifler in her course ,</l>
     <l n="104">‘ Tis odds against us she will take a worse . ”</l>
     <l n="105">Then met the friends ; the Widow heard the sigh</l>
     <l n="106">That ask 'd at once compassion and reply : -</l>
     <l n="107">“ Would you , my child , converse with one so poor ,</l>
     <l n="108">Yours were the kindness — yonder is my door :</l>
     <l n="109">And , save the time that we in public pray ,</l>
     <l n="110">From that poor cottage I but rarely stray . ”</l>
     <l n="111">There went the nymph , and made her strong complaints ,</l>
     <l n="112">Painting her woe as injured feeling paints .</l>
     <l n="113">“ Oh , dearest friend ! do think how one must feel ,</l>
     <l n="114">Shock 'd all day long , and sicken 'd every meal ;</l>
     <l n="115">Could you behold our kitchen ( and to you</l>
     <l n="116">A scene so shocking must indeed be new ) ,</l>
     <l n="117">A mind like yours , with true refinement graced ,</l>
     <l n="118">Would let no vulgar scenes pollute your taste :</l>
     <l n="119">And yet , in truth , from such a polish 'd mind</l>
     <l n="120">All base ideas must resistance find ,</l>
     <l n="121">And sordid pictures from the fancy pass ,</l>
     <l n="122">As the breath startles from the polish 'd glass .</l>
     <l n="123">“ Here you enjoy a sweet romantic scene ,</l>
     <l n="124">Without so pleasant , and within so clean ;</l>
     <l n="125">These twining jess'mines , what delicious gloom</l>
     <l n="126">And soothing fragrance yield they to the room !</l>
     <l n="127">What lovely garden ! there you oft retire ,</l>
     <l n="128">And tales of woe and tenderness admire .</l>
     <l n="129">In that neat case your books , in order placed ,</l>
     <l n="130">Soothe the full soul , and charm the cultur 'd taste ;</l>
     <l n="131">And thus , while all about you wears a charm ,</l>
     <l n="132">How must you scorn the Farmer and the Farm ! ”</l>
     <l n="133">The Widow smiled , and “ Know you not , ” said she ,</l>
     <l n="134">“ How much these farmers scorn or pity me ;</l>
     <l n="135">Who see what you admire , and laugh at all they see ?</l>
     <l n="136">True , their opinion alters not my fate ,</l>
     <l n="137">By falsely judging of an humble state :</l>
     <l n="138">This garden you with such delight behold ,</l>
     <l n="139">Tempts not a feeble dame who dreads the cold ;</l>
     <l n="140">These plants which please so well your livelier sense ,</l>
     <l n="141">To mine but little of their sweets dispense :</l>
     <l n="142">Books soon are painful to my failing sight ,</l>
     <l n="143">And oftener read from duty than delight ;</l>
     <l n="144">( Yet let me own , that I can sometimes find</l>
     <l n="145">Both joy and duty in the act combined ;)</l>
     <l n="146">But view me rightly , you will see no more</l>
     <l n="147">Than a poor female , willing to be poor ;</l>
     <l n="148">Happy indeed , but not in books nor flowers ,</l>
     <l n="149">Not in fair dreams , indulged in earlier hours ,</l>
     <l n="150">Of never-tasted joys ;— such visions shun ,</l>
     <l n="151">My youthful friend , nor scorn the Farmer 's Son . ”</l>
     <l n="152">“ Nay , ” said the Damsel , nothing pleased to see</l>
     <l n="153">A friend 's advice could like a Father 's be ,</l>
     <l n="154">“ Bless 'd in your cottage , you must surely smile</l>
     <l n="155">At those who live in our detested style :</l>
     <l n="156">To my Lucinda 's sympathising heart</l>
     <l n="157">Could I my prospects and my griefs impart ;,</l>
     <l n="158">She would console me ; but I dare not show ,</l>
     <l n="159">Ills that would wound her tender soul to know :</l>
     <l n="160">And I confess , it shocks my pride to tell</l>
     <l n="161">The secrets of the prison where I dwell ;</l>
     <l n="162">For that dear maiden would be shock 'd to feel</l>
     <l n="163">The secrets I should shudder to reveal ;</l>
     <l n="164">When told her friend was by a parent ask 'd ,</l>
     <l n="165">‘ Fed you the swine ? ’ — Good heaven ! how I am task 'd ! -</l>
     <l n="166">What ! can you smile ? Ah ! smile not at the grief</l>
     <l n="167">That woos your pity and demands relief . ”</l>
     <l n="168">“ Trifles , my love : you take a false alarm ;</l>
     <l n="169">Think , I beseech you , better of the Farm :</l>
     <l n="170">Duties in every state demand your care ,</l>
     <l n="171">And light are those that will require it there .</l>
     <l n="172">Fix on the Youth a favouring eye , and these ,</l>
     <l n="173">To him pertaining , or as his , will please . ”</l>
     <l n="174">“ What words , ” the Lass replied , “ offend my ear !</l>
     <l n="175">Try you my patience ? Can you be sincere ?</l>
     <l n="176">And am I told a willing hand to give</l>
     <l n="177">To a rude farmer , and with rustics live ?</l>
     <l n="178">Far other fate was yours ;— some gentle youth</l>
     <l n="179">Admir 'd your beauty , and avow 'd his truth ;</l>
     <l n="180">The power of love prevail 'd , and freely both</l>
     <l n="181">Gave the fond heart , and pledged the binding oath ;</l>
     <l n="182">And then the rival 's plot , the parent 's power ,</l>
     <l n="183">And jealous fears , drew on the happy hour :</l>
     <l n="184">Ah ! let not memory lose the blissful view ,</l>
     <l n="185">But fairly show what love has done for you . ”</l>
     <l n="186">“ Agreed , my daughter ; what my heart has known</l>
     <l n="187">Of Love 's strange power , shall be with frankness shown :</l>
     <l n="188">But let me warn you , that experience finds</l>
     <l n="189">Few of the scenes that lively hope designs . ”</l>
     <l n="190">“ Mysterious all , ” said Nancy ; “ you , I know ,</l>
     <l n="191">Have suffered much ; now deign the grief to show , -</l>
     <l n="192">I am your friend , and so prepare my heart</l>
     <l n="193">In all your sorrows to receive a part . ”</l>
     <l n="194">The Widow answer 'd : “ I had once , like you ,</l>
     <l n="195">Such thoughts of love ; no dream is more untrue ;</l>
     <l n="196">You judge it fated , and decreed to dwell</l>
     <l n="197">In youthful hearts , which nothing can expel ,</l>
     <l n="198">A passion doom 'd to reign , and irresistible .</l>
     <l n="199">The struggling mind , when once subdued , in vain</l>
     <l n="200">Rejects the fury or defies the pain ;</l>
     <l n="201">The strongest reason fails the flames t'allay ,</l>
     <l n="202">And resolution droops and faints away :</l>
     <l n="203">Hence , when the destined lovers meet , they prove</l>
     <l n="204">At once the force of this all-powerful love ;</l>
     <l n="205">Each from that period feels the mutual smart ,</l>
     <l n="206">Nor seeks to cure it — heart is changed for heart ;</l>
     <l n="207">Nor is there peace till they delighted stand ,</l>
     <l n="208">And , at the altar — hand is join 'd to hand .</l>
     <l n="209">“ Alas ! my child , there are who , dreaming so ,</l>
     <l n="210">Waste their fresh youth , and waking feel the woe .</l>
     <l n="211">There is no spirit sent the heart to move</l>
     <l n="212">With such prevailing and alarming love ;</l>
     <l n="213">Passion to reason will submit — or why</l>
     <l n="214">Should wealthy maids the poorest swains deny ?</l>
     <l n="215">Or how could classes and degrees create</l>
     <l n="216">The slightest bar to such resistless fate ?</l>
     <l n="217">Yet high and low , you see , forbear to mix ;</l>
     <l n="218">No beggars ’ eyes the heart of kings transfix ;</l>
     <l n="219">And who but am'rous peers or nobles sigh ,</l>
     <l n="220">When titled beauties pass triumphant by ?</l>
     <l n="221">For reason wakes , proud wishes to reprove ;</l>
     <l n="222">You cannot hope , and therefore dare not love ;</l>
     <l n="223">All would be safe , did we at first inquire -</l>
     <l n="224">‘ Does reason sanction what our hearts desire ? ’</l>
     <l n="225">But quitting precept , let example show</l>
     <l n="226">What joys from Love uncheck 'd by prudence flow .</l>
     <l n="227">“ A Youth my father in his office placed ,</l>
     <l n="228">Of humble fortune , but with sense and taste ;</l>
     <l n="229">But he was thin and pale , had downcast looks :</l>
     <l n="230">He studied much , and pored upon his books :</l>
     <l n="231">Confused he was when seen , and when he saw</l>
     <l n="232">Me or my sisters , would in haste withdraw ;</l>
     <l n="233">And had this youth departed with the year ,</l>
     <l n="234">His loss had cost us neither sigh nor tear .</l>
     <l n="235">“ But with my father still the youth remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="236">And more reward and kinder notice gain 'd :</l>
     <l n="237">He often , reading , to the garden stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="238">Where I by books or musing was delay 'd ;</l>
     <l n="239">This to discourse in summer evenings led ,</l>
     <l n="240">Of these same evenings , or of what we read :</l>
     <l n="241">On such occasions we were much alone ;</l>
     <l n="242">But , save the look , the manner , and the tone ,</l>
     <l n="243">( These might have meaning ,) all that we discuss 'd</l>
     <l n="244">We could with pleasure to a parent trust .</l>
     <l n="245">“ At length ‘ twas friendship — and my Friend and I</l>
     <l n="246">Said we were happy , and began to sigh ;</l>
     <l n="247">My sisters first , and then my father , found</l>
     <l n="248">That we were wandering o'er enchanted ground :</l>
     <l n="249">But he had troubles in his own aifairs ,</l>
     <l n="250">And would not bear addition to his cares :</l>
     <l n="251">With pity moved , yet angry , ‘ Child , ’ said he ,</l>
     <l n="252">‘ Will you embrace contempt and beggary ? ’</l>
     <l n="253">Can you endure to see each other cursed</l>
     <l n="254">By want , of every human woe the worst ?</l>
     <l n="255">Warring for ever with distress , in dread</l>
     <l n="256">Either of begging or of wanting bread ;</l>
     <l n="257">While poverty , with unrelenting force ,</l>
     <l n="258">Will your own offspring from your love divorce ;</l>
     <l n="259">They , through your folly , must be doom 'd to pine ,</l>
     <l n="260">And you deplore your passion , or resign ;</l>
     <l n="261">For if it die , what good will then remain ?</l>
     <l n="262">And if it live , it doubles every pain . ’ ”</l>
     <l n="263">“ But you were true , ” exclaim 'd the Lass , ” and fled</l>
     <l n="264">The tyrant 's power who fill 'd your soul with dread ? ”</l>
     <l n="265">“ But , ” said the smiling Friend , “ he fill 'd my mouth with bread :</l>
     <l n="266">And in what other place that bread to gain</l>
     <l n="267">We long consider 'd , and we sought in vain :</l>
     <l n="268">This was my twentieth year ,— at thirty-five</l>
     <l n="269">Our hope was fainter , yet our love alive ;</l>
     <l n="270">So many years in anxious doubt had pass 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="271">“ Then , ” said the Damsel , “ you were bless 'd at last ? ”</l>
     <l n="272">A smile again adorn 'd the Widow 's face ,</l>
     <l n="273">But soon a starting tear usurp 'd its place .</l>
     <l n="274">“ Slow pass 'd the heavy years , and each had more</l>
     <l n="275">Pains and vexations than the years before .</l>
     <l n="276">My father fail 'd ; his family was rent ,</l>
     <l n="277">And to new states his grieving daughters sent :</l>
     <l n="278">Each to more thriving kindred found a way ,</l>
     <l n="279">Guests without welcome ,— servants without pay ;</l>
     <l n="280">Our parting hour was grievous ; still I feel</l>
     <l n="281">The sad , sweet converse at our final meal ;</l>
     <l n="282">Our father then reveal 'd his former fears ,</l>
     <l n="283">Cause of his sternness , and then join 'd our tears :</l>
     <l n="284">Kindly he strove our feelings to repress ,</l>
     <l n="285">But died , and left us heirs to his distress .</l>
     <l n="286">The rich , as humble friends , my sisters chose ;</l>
     <l n="287">I with a wealthy widow sought repose ;</l>
     <l n="288">Who with a chilling frown her friend received ,</l>
     <l n="289">Bade me rejoice , and wonder 'd that I grieved :</l>
     <l n="290">In vain my anxious lover tried his skill ,</l>
     <l n="291">To rise in life , he was dependent still :</l>
     <l n="292">We met in grief , nor can I paint the fears</l>
     <l n="293">Of these unhappy , troubled , trying years :</l>
     <l n="294">Our dying hopes and stronger fears between ,</l>
     <l n="295">We felt no season peaceful or serene ;</l>
     <l n="296">Our fleeting joys , like meteors in the night ,</l>
     <l n="297">Shone on our gloom with inauspicious light ;</l>
     <l n="298">And then domestic sorrows , till the mind ,</l>
     <l n="299">Worn with distresses , to despair inclined ;</l>
     <l n="300">Add too the ill that from the passion flows ,</l>
     <l n="301">When its contemptuous frown the world bestows ,</l>
     <l n="302">The peevish spirit caused by long delay ,</l>
     <l n="303">When , being gloomy , we contemn the gay ,</l>
     <l n="304">When , being wretched , we incline to hate</l>
     <l n="305">And censure others in a happier state ;</l>
     <l n="306">Yet loving still , and still compell 'd to move</l>
     <l n="307">In the sad labyrinth of lingering love :</l>
     <l n="308">While you , exempt from want , despair , alarm ,</l>
     <l n="309">May wed — oh ! take the Farmer and the Farm . ”</l>
     <l n="310">“ Nay , ” said the nymph , “ joy smiled on you at last ? ”</l>
     <l n="311">“ Smiled for a moment , ” she replied , “ and pass 'd :</l>
     <l n="312">My lover still the same dull means pursued ,</l>
     <l n="313">Assistant call 'd , but kept in servitude ;</l>
     <l n="314">His spirits wearied in the prime of life ,</l>
     <l n="315">By fears and wishes in eternal strife ;</l>
     <l n="316">At length he urged impatient — ‘ Now consent ;</l>
     <l n="317">With thee united , Fortune may relent . ’</l>
     <l n="318">I paused , consenting ; but a Friend arose ,</l>
     <l n="319">Pleased a fair view , though distant , to disclose ;</l>
     <l n="320">From the rough ocean we beheld a gleam</l>
     <l n="321">Of joy , as transient as the joys we dream ;</l>
     <l n="322">By lying hopes deceived , my friend retired ,</l>
     <l n="323">And sail 'd — was wounded — reach 'd us — and expired !</l>
     <l n="324">You shall behold his grave ; and when I die ,</l>
     <l n="325">There — but ‘ tis folly — I request to lie . ”</l>
     <l n="326">“ Thus , ” said the lass , “ to joy you bade adieu !</l>
     <l n="327">But how a widow ?— that cannot be true :</l>
     <l n="328">Or was it force , in some unhappy hour ,</l>
     <l n="329">That placed you , grieving , in a tyrant 's power ? ”</l>
     <l n="330">“ Force , my young friend , when forty years are fled ,</l>
     <l n="331">Is what a woman seldom has to dread ;</l>
     <l n="332">She needs no brazen locks nor guarding walls ,</l>
     <l n="333">And seldom comes a lover though she calls :</l>
     <l n="334">Yet , moved by fancy , one approved my face ,</l>
     <l n="335">Though time and tears had wrought it much disgrace .</l>
     <l n="336">“ The man I married was sedate and meek ,</l>
     <l n="337">And spoke of love as men in earnest speak ;</l>
     <l n="338">Poor as I was , he ceaseless sought for years ,</l>
     <l n="339">A heart in sorrow and a face in tears :</l>
     <l n="340">That heart I gave not ; and ‘ twas long before</l>
     <l n="341">I gave attention , and then nothing more :</l>
     <l n="342">But in my breast some grateful feeling rose ,</l>
     <l n="343">For one whose love so sad a subject chose ;</l>
     <l n="344">Till long delaying , fearing to repent ,</l>
     <l n="345">But grateful still , I gave a cold assent .</l>
     <l n="346">Thus we were wed ; no fault had I to find ,</l>
     <l n="347">And he but one : my heart could not be kind :</l>
     <l n="348">Alas ! of every early hope bereft ,</l>
     <l n="349">There was no fondness in my bosom left ;</l>
     <l n="350">So had I told him , but had told in vain ,</l>
     <l n="351">He lived but to indulge me and complain :</l>
     <l n="352">His was this cottage ; he inclosed this ground .</l>
     <l n="353">And planted all these blooming shrubs around ;</l>
     <l n="354">He to my room these curious trifles brought ,</l>
     <l n="355">And with assiduous love my pleasure sought ;</l>
     <l n="356">He lived to please me , and I ofttimes strove ,</l>
     <l n="357">Smiling , to thank his unrequited love :</l>
     <l n="358">‘ Teach me , ’ he cried , ‘ that pensive mind to ease ,</l>
     <l n="359">For all my pleasure is the hope to please . ’</l>
     <l n="360">Serene though heavy , were the days we spent ,</l>
     <l n="361">Yet kind each word , and gen'rous each intent ;</l>
     <l n="362">But his dejection lessen 'd every day ,</l>
     <l n="363">And to a placid kindness died away :</l>
     <l n="364">In tranquil ease we pass 'd our latter years ,</l>
     <l n="365">By griefs untroubled , unassail 'd by fears .</l>
     <l n="366">Let not romantic views your bosom sway ;</l>
     <l n="367">Yield to your duties , and their call obey :</l>
     <l n="368">Fly not a Youth , frank , honest , and sincere ;</l>
     <l n="369">Observe his merits , and his passion hear !</l>
     <l n="370">‘ Tis true , no hero , but a farmer , sues -</l>
     <l n="371">Slow in his speech , but worthy in his views ;</l>
     <l n="372">With him you cannot that affliction prove ,</l>
     <l n="373">That rends the bosom of the poor in love :</l>
     <l n="374">Health , comfort , competence , and cheerful days ,</l>
     <l n="375">Your friends ’ approval , and your father 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="376">Will crown the deed , and you escape their fate</l>
     <l n="377">Who plan so wildly , and are wise too late . ”</l>
     <l n="378">The Damsel heard ; at first th ’ advice was strange ,</l>
     <l n="379">Yet wrought a happy , nay , a speedy change :</l>
     <l n="380">“ I have no care , ” she said , when next they met ,</l>
     <l n="381">But one may wonder , he is silent yet ;</l>
     <l n="382">He looks around him with his usual stare ,</l>
     <l n="383">And utters nothing — not that I shall care . ”</l>
     <l n="384">This pettish humour pleased th ’ experienced Friend -</l>
     <l n="385">None need despair , whose silence can offend ;</l>
     <l n="386">“ Should I , ” resumed the thoughtful Lass , “ consent</l>
     <l n="387">To hear the man , the man may now repent :</l>
     <l n="388">Think you my sighs shall call him from the plough ,</l>
     <l n="389">Or give one hint , that ‘ You may woo me now ? ’ ”</l>
     <l n="390">“ Persist , my love , ” replied the Friend , “ and gain</l>
     <l n="391">A parent 's praise , that cannot be in vain . ”</l>
     <l n="392">The father saw the change , but not the cause ,</l>
     <l n="393">And gave the alter 'd maid his fond applause :</l>
     <l n="394">The coarser manners she in part removed ,</l>
     <l n="395">In part endured , improving and improved ;</l>
     <l n="396">She spoke of household works , she rose betimes ,</l>
     <l n="397">And said neglect and indolence were crimes ;</l>
     <l n="398">The various duties of their life she weigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="399">And strict attention to her dairy paid ;</l>
     <l n="400">The names of servants now familiar grew ,</l>
     <l n="401">And fair Lucinda 's from her mind withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="402">As prudent travellers for their ease assume</l>
     <l n="403">Their modes and language to whose lands they come ;</l>
     <l n="404">So to the Farmer this fair Lass inclined ,</l>
     <l n="405">Gave to the business of the Farm her mind ;</l>
     <l n="406">To useful arts she turned her hand and eye ;</l>
     <l n="407">And by her manners told him — “ You may try . ”</l>
     <l n="408">Th ’ observing Lover more attention paid ,</l>
     <l n="409">With growing pleasure , to the alter 'd maid ;</l>
     <l n="410">He fear 'd to lose her , and began to see</l>
     <l n="411">That a slim beauty might a helpmate be :</l>
     <l n="412">‘ Twixt hope and fear he now the lass address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="413">And in his Sunday robe his love express 'd :</l>
     <l n="414">She felt no chilling dread , no thrilling joy ,</l>
     <l n="415">Nor was too quickly kind , too slowly coy ;</l>
     <l n="416">But still she lent an unreluctant ear</l>
     <l n="417">To all the rural business of the year ;</l>
     <l n="418">Till love 's strong hopes endured no more delay ,</l>
     <l n="419">And Harry ask 'd , and Nancy named the day .</l>
     <l n="420">“ A happy change ! my Boy , ” the father cried :</l>
     <l n="421">“ How lost your sister all her school-day pride ? ”</l>
     <l n="422">The Youth replied , “ It is the Widow 's deed ;</l>
     <l n="423">The cure is perfect and was wrought with speed .</l>
     <l n="424">And comes there , Boy , this benefit of books ,</l>
     <l n="425">Of that smart dress , and of those dainty looks ?</l>
     <l n="426">We must be kind — some offerings from the Farm</l>
     <l n="427">To the White Cot will speak our feelings warm ;</l>
     <l n="428">Will show that people , when they know the fact ,</l>
     <l n="429">Where they have judged severely , can retract .</l>
     <l n="430">Oft have I smiled , when I beheld her pass</l>
     <l n="431">With cautious step as if she hurt the grass ;</l>
     <l n="432">Where , if a snail 's retreat she chanced to storm ,</l>
     <l n="433">She look 'd as begging pardon of the worm ;</l>
     <l n="434">And what , said I , still laughing at the view ,</l>
     <l n="435">Have these weak creatures in the world to do ?</l>
     <l n="436">But some are made for action , some to speak ;</l>
     <l n="437">And , while she looks so pitiful and meek ,</l>
     <l n="438">Her words are weighty , though her nerves are weak . ’</l>
     <l n="439">Soon told the village-bells the rite was done ,</l>
     <l n="440">That joined the school-bred Miss and Farmer 's Son ;</l>
     <l n="441">Her former habits some slight scandal raised ,</l>
     <l n="442">But real worth was soon perceived and praised ;</l>
     <l n="443">She , her neat taste imparted to the Farm ,</l>
     <l n="444">And he , th ’ improving skill and vigorous arm .</l>

     <l n="22">Gain 'd all her wishes from their pride or fears ;</l>
     <l n="23">She wrote a billet , and a novel read ,</l>
     <l n="24">And with her fame her vanity was fed ;</l>
     <l n="25">Each word , each look , each action was a cause</l>
     <l n="26">For flattering wonder and for fond applause ;</l>
     <l n="27">She rode or danced , and ever glanced around ,</l>

     <l n="41">Here , on the favour 'd beauty Fortune smiled ;</l>
     <l n="42">Her chosen Husband was a man so mild ,</l>
     <l n="43">So humbly temper 'd , so intent to please ,</l>
     <l n="44">It quite distress 'd her to remain at ease ,</l>
     <l n="45">Without a cause to sigh , without pretence to tease :</l>

     <l n="80">Her father 's sister , who the world had seen</l>
     <l n="81">Near sixty years when Lucy saw sixteen ,</l>
     <l n="82">Begg 'd the plain girl : the gracious Mother smiled ,</l>
     <l n="83">And freely gave her grieved but passive child ;</l>

     <l n="90">Beauty to keep , adorn , increase , and guard ,</l>
     <l n="91">Was their sole care , and had its full reward :</l>
     <l n="92">In rising splendour with the one it reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="93">And in the other was by care sustain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="94">The daughter 's charms increased , the parent 's yet remain 'd .</l>
     <l n="95">Leave we these ladies to their daily care ,</l>
     <l n="96">To see how meekness and discretion fare : -</l>
     <l n="97">A village maid , unvex 'd by want or love ,</l>
     <l n="98">Could not with more delight than Lucy move ;</l>
     <l n="99">The village lark , high mounted in the spring ,</l>
     <l n="100">Could not with purer joy than Lucy sing ;</l>
     <l n="101">Her cares all light , her pleasures all sincere ,</l>
     <l n="102">Her duty joy , and her companion dear ;</l>
     <l n="103">In tender friendship and in true respect</l>
     <l n="104">Lived Aunt and Niece , no flattery , no neglect -</l>
     <l n="105">They read , walk 'd , visited — together pray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="106">Together slept the matron and the maid :</l>
     <l n="107">There was such goodness , such pure nature seen</l>
     <l n="108">In Lucy 's looks , a manner so serene ;</l>
     <l n="109">Such harmony in motion , speech , and air ,</l>
     <l n="110">That without fairness she was more than fair ,</l>
     <l n="111">Had more than beauty in each speaking grace ,</l>
     <l n="112">That lent their cloudless glory to the face ;</l>
     <l n="113">Where mild good sense in placid looks were shown ,</l>
     <l n="114">And felt in every bosom but her own ;</l>
     <l n="115">The one presiding feature in her mind</l>
     <l n="116">Was the pure meekness of a will resign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="117">A tender spirit , freed from all pretence</l>
     <l n="118">Of wit , and pleased in mild benevolence ;</l>
     <l n="119">Bless 'd in protecting fondness she reposed</l>
     <l n="120">With every wish indulged though undisclosed ;</l>
     <l n="121">But love , like zephyr on the limpid lake ,</l>
     <l n="122">Was now the bosom of the maid to shake ,</l>
     <l n="123">And in that gentle mind a gentle strife to make .</l>
     <l n="124">Among their chosen friends , a favoured few</l>
     <l n="125">The aunt and niece a youthful Rector knew ;</l>
     <l n="126">Who , though a younger brother , might address</l>
     <l n="127">A younger sister , fearless of success ;</l>
     <l n="128">His friends , a lofty race , their native pride</l>
     <l n="129">At first display 'd , and their assent denied :</l>
     <l n="130">But , pleased such virtues and such love to trace ,</l>
     <l n="131">They own 'd she would adorn the loftiest race .</l>
     <l n="132">The Aunt , a mother 's caution to supply ,</l>
     <l n="133">Had watch 'd the youthful priest with jealous eye ;</l>
     <l n="134">And , anxious for her charge , had view 'd unseen</l>
     <l n="135">The cautious life that keeps the conscience clean :</l>
     <l n="136">In all she found him all she wish 'd to find ,</l>
     <l n="137">With slight exception of a lofty mind :</l>
     <l n="138">A certain manner that express 'd desire</l>
     <l n="139">To be received as brother to the ‘ Squire .</l>
     <l n="140">Lucy 's meek eye had beam 'd with many a tear ,</l>
     <l n="141">Lucy 's soft heart had beat with many a fear ,</l>
     <l n="142">Before he told ( although his looks , she thought ,</l>
     <l n="143">Had oft confess 'd ) that he her favour sought ;</l>
     <l n="144">But when he kneel 'd , ( she wish 'd him not to kneel ,)</l>
     <l n="145">And spoke the fears and hopes that lovers feel ;</l>
     <l n="146">When too the prudent aunt herself confess 'd</l>
     <l n="147">Her wishes on the gentle youth would rest ;</l>
     <l n="148">The maiden 's eye with tender passion beam 'd ,</l>
     <l n="149">She dwelt with fondness on the life she schemed ;</l>
     <l n="150">The household cares , the soft and lasting ties</l>
     <l n="151">Of love , with all his binding charities ;</l>
     <l n="152">Their village taught , consoled , assisted , fed ,</l>
     <l n="153">Till the young zealot tears of pleasure shed .</l>
     <l n="154">But would her Mother ? Ah ! she fear 'd it wrong</l>
     <l n="155">To have indulged these forward hopes so long ,</l>
     <l n="156">Her mother loved , but was not used to grant</l>
     <l n="157">Favours so freely as her gentle aunt . -</l>
     <l n="158">Her gentle aunt , with smiles that angels wear ,</l>
     <l n="159">Dispell 'd her Lucy 's apprehensive tear :</l>
     <l n="160">Her prudent foresight the request had made</l>
     <l n="161">To one whom none could govern , few persuade ;</l>
     <l n="162">She doubted much if one in earnest woo 'd</l>
     <l n="163">A girl with not a single charm endued ;</l>
     <l n="164">The Sister 's nobler views she then declared ,</l>
     <l n="165">And what small sum for Lucy could be spared ;</l>
     <l n="166">“ If more than this the foolish priest requires ,</l>
     <l n="167">Tell him , ” she wrote , ” to check his vain desires . ”</l>
     <l n="168">At length , with many a cold expression mix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="169">With many a sneer on girls so fondly fix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="170">There came a promise — should they not repent ,</l>
     <l n="171">But take with grateful minds the portion meant ,</l>
     <l n="172">And wait the Sister 's day — the Mother might consent .</l>
     <l n="173">And here , might pitying hope o'er truth prevail ,</l>
     <l n="174">Or love o'er fortune , we would end our tale ;</l>
     <l n="175">For who more bless 'd than youthful pair removed</l>
     <l n="176">From fear of want — by mutual friends approved -</l>
     <l n="177">Short time to wait , and in that time to live</l>
     <l n="178">With all the pleasures hope and fancy give ;</l>
     <l n="179">Their equal passion raised on just esteem ,</l>
     <l n="180">When reason sanctions all that love can dream ?</l>
     <l n="181">Yes ! reason sanctions what stern fate denies :</l>
     <l n="182">The early prospect in the glory dies ,</l>
     <l n="183">As the soft smiles on dying infants play</l>
     <l n="184">In their mild features , and then pass away .</l>
     <l n="185">The Beauty died ere she could yield her hand</l>
     <l n="186">In the high marriage by the Mother plann 'd ;</l>
     <l n="187">Who grieved indeed , but found a vast relief</l>
     <l n="188">In a cold heart , that ever warr 'd with grief .</l>
     <l n="189">Lucy was present when her sister died ,</l>
     <l n="190">Heiress to duties that she ill supplied :</l>
     <l n="191">There were no mutual feelings , sister arts ,</l>
     <l n="192">No kindred taste , nor intercourse of hearts :</l>
     <l n="193">When in the mirror play 'd the matron 's smile ,</l>
     <l n="194">The maiden 's thoughts were traveling all the while ;</l>
     <l n="195">And when desired to speak , she sigh 'd to find</l>
     <l n="196">Her pause offended ; “ Envy made her blind :</l>
     <l n="197">Tasteless she was , nor had a claim in life</l>
     <l n="198">Above the station of a rector 's wife ;</l>
     <l n="199">Yet as an heiress , she must shun disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="200">Although no heiress to her mother 's face :</l>
     <l n="201">It is your duty , ” said th ’ imperious dame ,</l>
     <l n="202">“ ( Advanced your fortune ,) to advance your name ,</l>

     <l n="205">May look upon you , and for favour sigh ;</l>
     <l n="206">Nor can you offer a reluctant hand ;</l>
     <l n="207">His birth is noble , and his seat is grand . ”</l>
     <l n="208">Alarm 'd was Lucy , was in tears — “ A fool !</l>
     <l n="209">Was she a child in love ?— a miss at school ?</l>
     <l n="210">Doubts any mortal , if a change of state</l>
     <l n="211">Dissolves all claims and ties of earlier date ? ”</l>
     <l n="212">The Rector doubted , for he came to mourn</l>
     <l n="213">A sister dead , and with a wife return :</l>
     <l n="214">Lucy with heart unchanged received the youth ,</l>
     <l n="215">True in herself , confiding in his truth ;</l>
     <l n="216">But own 'd her mother 's change ; the haughty dame</l>
     <l n="217">Pour 'd strong contempt upon the youthful flame ;</l>
     <l n="218">She firmly vow 'd her purpose to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="219">Judged her own cause , and bade the youth adieu !</l>
     <l n="220">The lover begg 'd , insisted , urged his pain ,</l>
     <l n="221">His brother wrote to threaten and complain ;</l>
     <l n="222">Her sister reasoning proved the promise made ,</l>
     <l n="223">Lucy appealing to a parent pray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="224">But all opposed the event that she design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="225">And all in vain — she never changed her mind ;</l>
     <l n="226">But coldly answer 'd in her wonted way ,</l>
     <l n="227">That she “ would rule , and Lucy must obey . ”</l>
     <l n="228">With peevish fear , she saw her health decline ,</l>
     <l n="229">And cried , “ Oh ! monstrous , for a man to pine !</l>
     <l n="230">But if your foolish heart must yield to love ,</l>
     <l n="231">Let him possess it whom I now approve ;</l>
     <l n="232">This is my pleasure . ” — Still the Rector came</l>
     <l n="233">With larger offers and with bolder claim ;</l>
     <l n="234">But the stern lady would attend no more -</l>
     <l n="235">She frown 'd , and rudely pointed to the door ;</l>
     <l n="236">Whate'er he wrote , he saw unread return 'd ,</l>
     <l n="237">And he , indignant , the dishonour spurn 'd :</l>
     <l n="238">Nay , fix 'd suspicion where he might confide ,</l>
     <l n="239">And sacrificed his passion to his pride .</l>
     <l n="240">Lucy , meantime , though threaten 'd and distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="241">Against her marriage made a strong protest :</l>
     <l n="242">All was domestic war ; the Aunt rebell 'd</l>
     <l n="243">Against the sovereign will , and was expell 'd ;</l>
     <l n="244">And every power was tried , and every art ,</l>
     <l n="245">To bend to falsehood one determined heart ;</l>
     <l n="246">Assail 'd , in patience it received the shock ,</l>
     <l n="247">Soft as the wave , unshaken as the rock :</l>
     <l n="248">But while th ’ unconquer 'd soul endures the storm</l>
     <l n="249">Of angry fate , it preys upon the form ;</l>
     <l n="250">With conscious virtue she resisted still ,</l>
     <l n="251">And conscious love gave vigour to her will ;</l>
     <l n="252">But Lucy 's trial was at hand ; with joy</l>
     <l n="253">The Mother cried — “ Behold your constant boy -</l>
     <l n="254">Thursday — was married : — take the paper , sweet ,</l>
     <l n="255">And read the conduct of your reverend cheat ;</l>
     <l n="256">See with what pomp of coaches , in what crowd</l>
     <l n="257">The creature married — of his falsehood proud !</l>
     <l n="258">False , did I say ?— at least no whining fool ;</l>
     <l n="259">And thus will hopeless passions ever cool :</l>
     <l n="260">But shall his bride your single state reproach ?</l>
     <l n="261">No ! give him crowd for crowd , and coach for coach .</l>
     <l n="262">Oh ! you retire ; reflect then , gentle miss ,</l>
     <l n="263">And gain some spirit in a cause like this . ”</l>
     <l n="264">Some spirit Lucy gain 'd ; a steady soul ,</l>
     <l n="265">Defying all persuasion , all control :</l>
     <l n="266">In vain reproach , derision , threats were tried ;</l>
     <l n="267">The constant mind all outward force defied ,</l>
     <l n="268">By vengeance vainly urged , in vain assail 'd by pride ;</l>
     <l n="269">Fix 'd in her purpose , perfect in her part ,</l>
     <l n="270">She felt the courage of a wounded heart ;</l>
     <l n="271">The world receded from her rising view ,</l>
     <l n="272">When heaven approach 'd as earthly things withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="273">Not strange before , for in the days of love ,</l>
     <l n="274">Joy , hope , and pleasure , she had thoughts above ,</l>
     <l n="275">Pious when most of worldly prospects fond ,</l>
     <l n="276">When they best pleased her she could look beyond ;</l>
     <l n="277">Had the young priest a faithful lover died ,</l>
     <l n="278">Something had been her bosom to divide ;</l>
     <l n="279">Now heaven had all , for in her holiest views</l>
     <l n="280">She saw the matron whom she fear 'd to lose ;</l>
     <l n="281">While from her parent , the dejected maid</l>
     <l n="282">Forced the unpleasant thought , or thinking pray 'd .</l>
     <l n="283">Surprised , the mother saw the languid frame ,</l>
     <l n="284">And felt indignant , yet forbore to blame ;</l>
     <l n="285">Once with a frown she cried , “ And do you mean</l>
     <l n="286">To die of love — the folly of fifteen ? ”</l>
     <l n="287">But as her anger met with no reply ,</l>
     <l n="288">She let the gentle girl in quiet die ;</l>
     <l n="289">And to her sister wrote , impell 'd by pain ,</l>
     <l n="290">“ Come quickly , Martha , or you come in vain . ”</l>
     <l n="291">Lucy meantime profess 'd with joy sincere ,</l>
     <l n="292">That nothing held , employ 'd , engaged her here .</l>
     <l n="293">“ I am an humble actor , doom 'd to play</l>
     <l n="294">A part obscure , and then to glide away :</l>
     <l n="295">Incurious how the great or happy shine ,</l>
     <l n="296">Or who have parts obscure and sad as mine ;</l>
     <l n="297">In its best prospect I but wish 'd for life ,</l>
     <l n="298">To be th ’ assiduous , gentle , useful wife ;</l>
     <l n="299">That lost , with wearied mind , and spirit poor ,</l>
     <l n="300">I drop my efforts , and can act no more ;</l>
     <l n="301">With growing joy I feel my spirits tend</l>
     <l n="302">To that last scene where all my duties end . ”</l>
     <l n="303">Hope , ease , delight , the thoughts of dying gave ,</l>
     <l n="304">Till Lucy spoke with fondness of the grave ;</l>
     <l n="305">She smiled with wasted form , but spirit firm ,</l>
     <l n="306">And said , “ She left but little for the worm : ”</l>
     <l n="307">As toll 'd the bell , “ There 's one , ” she said , “ hath press 'd</l>
     <l n="308">Awhile before me to the bed of rest : ”</l>
     <l n="309">And she beside her with attention spread</l>
     <l n="310">The decorations of the maiden dead .</l>
     <l n="311">While quickly thus the mortal part declin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="312">The happiest visions fill 'd the active mind ;</l>
     <l n="313">A soft , religious melancholy gain 'd</l>
     <l n="314">Entire possession , and for ever reign 'd :</l>
     <l n="315">On Holy Writ her mind reposing dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="316">She saw the wonders , she the mercies felt ;</l>
     <l n="317">Till , in a bless 'd and glorious reverie ,</l>
     <l n="318">She seem 'd the Saviour as on earth to see ,</l>
     <l n="319">And , fill 'd with love divine , th ’ attending friend to be ;</l>
     <l n="320">Or she who trembling , yet confiding , stole</l>
     <l n="321">Near to the garment , touch 'd it , and was whole ;</l>
     <l n="322">When , such the intenseness of the working thought ,</l>
     <l n="323">On her it seem 'd the very deed was wrought ;</l>
     <l n="324">She the glad patient 's fear and rapture found ,</l>
     <l n="325">The holy transport , and the healing wound ;</l>
     <l n="326">This was so fix 'd , so grafted in the heart ,</l>
     <l n="327">That she adopted , nay became the part :</l>
     <l n="328">But one chief scene was present to her sight ,</l>
     <l n="329">Her Saviour resting in the tomb by night ;</l>
     <l n="330">Her fever rose , and still her wedded mind</l>
     <l n="331">Was to that scene , that hallow 'd cave , confin 'd -</l>
     <l n="332">Where in the shade of death the body laid ,</l>
     <l n="333">There watch 'd the spirit of the wandering maid ;</l>
     <l n="334">Her looks were fix 'd , entranced , illumed , serene ,</l>
     <l n="335">In the still glory of the midnight scene :</l>
     <l n="336">There at her Saviour 's feet , in visions bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="337">Th ’ enraptured maid a sacred joy possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="338">In patience waiting for the first-born ray</l>
     <l n="339">Of that all-glorious and triumphant day :</l>
     <l n="340">To this idea all her soul she gave ,</l>
     <l n="341">Her mind reposing by the sacred grave ;</l>
     <l n="342">Then sleep would seal the eye , the vision close ,</l>
     <l n="343">And steep the solemn thoughts in brief repose .</l>
     <l n="344">Then grew the soul serene , and all its powers</l>
     <l n="345">Again restored , illumed the dying hours ;</l>
     <l n="346">But reason dwelt where fancy stray 'd before ,</l>
     <l n="347">And the mind wander 'd from its views no more ;</l>
     <l n="348">Till death approach 'd , when every look express 'd</l>
     <l n="349">A sense of bliss , till every sense had rest .</l>
     <l n="350">The mother lives , and has enough to buy</l>
     <l n="351">The attentive ear and the submissive eye</l>
     <l n="352">Of abject natures — these are daily told ,</l>
     <l n="353">How triumph 'd beauty in the days of old ;</l>
     <l n="354">How , by her window seated , crowds have cast</l>
     <l n="355">Admiring glances , wondering as they pass 'd ;</l>
     <l n="356">How from her carriage as she stepp 'd to pray ,</l>
     <l n="357">Divided ranks would humbly make her way ;</l>
     <l n="358">And how each voice in the astonish 'd throng</l>
     <l n="359">Pronounced her peerless as she moved along .</l>
     <l n="360">Her picture then the greedy Dame displays ;</l>
     <l n="361">Touch 'd by no shame , she now demands its praise ;</l>
     <l n="362">In her tall mirror then she shows a face ,</l>
     <l n="363">Still coldly fair with unaffecting grace ;</l>
     <l n="364">These she compares : “ It has the form , ” she cries ,</l>
     <l n="365">“ But wants the air , the spirit , and the eyes ;</l>
     <l n="366">This , as a likeness , is correct and true ,</l>
     <l n="367">But there alone the living grace we view . ”</l>
     <l n="368">This said , th ’ applauding voice the Dame requir 'd ,</l>
     <l n="369">And , gazing , slowly from the glass retired .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="11">Of a fair town where Doctor Rack was guide ,</l>
     <l n="12">His only daughter was the boast and pride -</l>
     <l n="13">Wise Arabella , yet not wise alone ,</l>
     <l n="14">She like a bright and polish 'd brilliant shone ;</l>
     <l n="15">Her father own 'd her for his prop and stay ,</l>
     <l n="16">Able to guide , yet willing to obey ;</l>
     <l n="17">Pleased with her learning while discourse could please ,</l>
     <l n="18">And with her love in languor and disease :</l>
     <l n="19">To every mother were her virtues known ,</l>
     <l n="20">And to their daughters as a pattern shown ;</l>
     <l n="21">Who in her youth had all that age requires ,</l>
     <l n="22">And with her prudence all that youth admires :</l>
     <l n="23">These odious praises made the damsels try</l>
     <l n="24">Not to obtain such merits , but deny ;</l>
     <l n="25">For , whatsoever wise mammas might say ,</l>
     <l n="26">To guide a daughter , this was not the way ;</l>
     <l n="27">From such applause disdain and anger rise ,</l>
     <l n="28">And envy lives where emulation dies .</l>
     <l n="29">In all his strength contends the noble horse</l>
     <l n="30">With one who just precedes him on the course ,</l>
     <l n="31">But when the rival flies too far before ,</l>
     <l n="32">His spirit fails , and he attempts no more .</l>
     <l n="33">This reasoning Maid , above her sex 's dread ,</l>
     <l n="34">Had dared to read , and dared to say she read ;</l>
     <l n="35">Not the last novel , not the new-born play ;</l>
     <l n="36">Not the mere trash and scandal of the day ;</l>
     <l n="37">But ( though her young companions felt the shock )</l>
     <l n="38">She studied Berkeley , Bacon , Hobbes and Locke :</l>
     <l n="39">Her mind within the maze of history dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="40">And of the moral Muse the beauty felt ;</l>
     <l n="41">The merits of the Roman page she knew ,</l>
     <l n="42">And could converse with More and Montague :</l>
     <l n="43">Thus she became the wonder of the town ,</l>
     <l n="44">From that she reap 'd , to that she gave renown ;</l>
     <l n="45">And strangers coming , all were taught t'admire</l>
     <l n="46">The learned lady , and the lofty spire .</l>
     <l n="47">Thus fame in public fix 'd the Maid where all</l>
     <l n="48">Might throw their darts , and see the idol fall :</l>
     <l n="49">A hundred arrows came with vengeance keen ,</l>
     <l n="50">From tongues envenom 'd , and from arms unseen ;</l>
     <l n="51">A thousand eyes were fix 'd upon the place ,</l>
     <l n="52">That , if she fell , she might not fly disgrace :</l>
     <l n="53">But malice vainly throws the poison 'd dart ,</l>
     <l n="54">Unless our frailty shows the peccant part ;</l>
     <l n="55">And Arabella still preserved her name</l>
     <l n="56">Untouch 'd , and shone with undisputed fame ;</l>
     <l n="57">Her very notice some respect would cause ,</l>
     <l n="58">And her esteem was honour and applause .</l>
     <l n="59">Men she avoided ; not in childish fear ,</l>
     <l n="60">As if she thought some savage foe was near ;</l>
     <l n="61">Not as a prude , who hides that man should seek ,</l>
     <l n="62">Or who by silence hints that they should speak ;</l>
     <l n="63">But with discretion all the sex she view 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">Ere yet engaged pursuing or pursued ;</l>
     <l n="65">Ere love had made her to his vices blind ,</l>
     <l n="66">Or hid the favourite 's failings from her mind .</l>
     <l n="67">Thus was the picture of the man portray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="68">By merit destined for so rare a maid ;</l>
     <l n="69">At whose request she might exchange her state ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or still be happy in a virgin 's fate : -</l>
     <l n="71">He must be one with manners like her own ,</l>
     <l n="72">His life unquestion 'd , his opinions known ;</l>
     <l n="73">His stainless virtue must all tests endure ,</l>
     <l n="74">His honour spotless , and his bosom pure ;</l>
     <l n="75">She no allowance made for sex or times ,</l>
     <l n="76">Of lax opinion — crimes were ever crimes ;</l>
     <l n="77">No wretch forsaken must his frailty curse ,</l>
     <l n="78">No spurious offspring drain his private purse ;</l>
     <l n="79">He at all times his passions must command ,</l>
     <l n="80">And yet possess — or be refused her hand .</l>
     <l n="81">All this without reserve the maiden told ,</l>
     <l n="82">And some began to weigh the rector 's gold ;</l>
     <l n="83">To ask what sum a prudent man might gain ,</l>
     <l n="84">Who had such store of virtues to maintain ?</l>
     <l n="85">A Doctor Campbell , north of Tweed , came forth ,</l>
     <l n="86">Declared his passion , and proclaim 'd his worth ;</l>
     <l n="87">Not unapproved , for he had much to say</l>
     <l n="88">On every cause , and in a pleasant way ;</l>
     <l n="89">Not all his trust was in a pliant tongue ,</l>
     <l n="90">His form was good , and ruddy he , and young :</l>
     <l n="91">But though the doctor was a man of parts ,</l>
     <l n="92">He read not deeply male or female hearts ;</l>
     <l n="93">But judged that all whom he esteem 'd as wise</l>
     <l n="94">Must think alike , though some assumed disguise ;</l>
     <l n="95">That every reasoning Brahmin , Christian , Jew ,</l>
     <l n="96">Of all religions took their liberal view ;</l>
     <l n="97">And of her own , no doubt , this learned Maid</l>
     <l n="98">Denied the substance , and the forms obey 'd :</l>
     <l n="99">And thus persuaded , he his thoughts express 'd</l>
     <l n="100">Of her opinions , and his own profess 'd :</l>
     <l n="101">“ All states demand this aid , the vulgar need</l>
     <l n="102">Their priests and prayers , their sermons and their creed ;</l>
     <l n="103">And those of stronger minds should never speak</l>
     <l n="104">( In his opinion ) what might hurt the weak :</l>
     <l n="105">A man may smile , but still he should attend</l>
     <l n="106">His hour at church , and be the Church 's friend ,</l>
     <l n="107">What there he thinks conceal , and what he hears commend . ”</l>
     <l n="108">Frank was the speech , but heard with high disdain ,</l>
     <l n="109">Nor had the doctor leave to speak again ;</l>
     <l n="110">A man who own 'd , nay gloried in deceit ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ He might despise her , but he should not cheat . ”</l>
     <l n="112">The Vicar Holmes appear 'd : he heard it said</l>
     <l n="113">That ancient men best pleased the prudent maid ;</l>
     <l n="114">And true it was her ancient friends she loved ,</l>
     <l n="115">Servants when old she favour 'd and approved ;</l>
     <l n="116">Age in her pious parents she revered ,</l>
     <l n="117">And neighbours were by length of days endear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="118">But , if her husband too must ancient be ,</l>
     <l n="119">The good old vicar found it was not he .</l>
     <l n="120">On Captain Bligh her mind in balance hung -</l>
     <l n="121">Though valiant , modest ; and reserved , though young :</l>
     <l n="122">Against these merits must defects be set -</l>
     <l n="123">Though poor , imprudent ; and though proud , in debt :</l>
     <l n="124">In vain the captain close attention paid ;</l>
     <l n="125">She found him wanting , whom she fairly weigh 'd .</l>
     <l n="126">Then came a youth , and all their friends agreed</l>
     <l n="127">That Edward Huntly was the man indeed ;</l>
     <l n="128">Respectful duty he had paid awhile ,</l>
     <l n="129">Then ask 'd her hand , and had a gracious smile :</l>
     <l n="130">A lover now declared , he led the fair</l>
     <l n="131">To woods and fields , to visits , and to pray'r ;</l>
     <l n="132">Then whisper 'd softly — “ Will you name the day ? ”</l>
     <l n="133">She softly whisper 'd — “ If you love me , stay . ”</l>
     <l n="134">“ Oh ! try me not beyond my strength , ” he cried :</l>
     <l n="135">“ Oh ! be not weak , ” the prudent Maid replied ;</l>
     <l n="136">“ But by some trial your affection prove -</l>
     <l n="137">Respect , and not impatience , argues love :</l>
     <l n="138">And love no more is by impatience known ,</l>
     <l n="139">Than ocean 's depth is by its tempests shown :</l>
     <l n="140">He whom a weak and fond impatience sways ,</l>
     <l n="141">But for himself with all his fervour prays ,</l>
     <l n="142">And not the maid he woos , but his own will obeys ;</l>
     <l n="143">And will she love the being who prefers ,</l>
     <l n="144">With so much ardour , his desire to hers ? ”</l>
     <l n="145">Young Edward grieved , but let not grief be seen ;</l>
     <l n="146">He knew obedience pleased his fancy 's queen :</l>
     <l n="147">Awhile he waited , and then cried — “ Behold !</l>
     <l n="148">The year advancing , be no longer cold ! ”</l>
     <l n="149">For she had promised — “ Let the flowers appear ,</l>
     <l n="150">And I will pass with thee the smiling year : ”</l>
     <l n="151">Then pressing grew the youth ; the more he press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="152">The less inclined the maid to his request :</l>
     <l n="153">“ Let June arrive . ” Alas ! when April came ,</l>
     <l n="154">It brought a stranger , and the stranger , shame ;</l>
     <l n="155">Nor could the Lover from his house persuade</l>
     <l n="156">A stubborn lass whom he had mournful made ;</l>
     <l n="157">Angry and weak , by thoughtless vengeance moved ,</l>
     <l n="158">She told her story to the Fair beloved ;</l>
     <l n="159">In strongest words th ’ unwelcome truth was shown ,</l>
     <l n="160">To blight his prospects , careless of her own .</l>
     <l n="161">Our heroine grieved , but had too firm a heart</l>
     <l n="162">For him to soften , when she swore to part ;</l>
     <l n="163">In vain his seeming penitence and pray'r ,</l>
     <l n="164">His vows , his tears ; she left him in despair :</l>
     <l n="165">His mother fondly laid her grief aside ,</l>
     <l n="166">And to the reason of the nymph applied : -</l>
     <l n="167">“ It well becomes thee , lady , to appear ,</l>
     <l n="168">But not to be , in very truth , severe ;</l>
     <l n="169">Although the crime be odious in thy sight ,</l>
     <l n="170">That daring sex is taught such things to slight ,</l>
     <l n="171">His heart is thine , although it once was frail ;</l>
     <l n="172">Think of his grief , and let his love prevail ! ”</l>
     <l n="173">“ Plead thou no more , “ the lofty lass return 'd ;</l>
     <l n="174">“ Forgiving woman is deceived and spurn 'd :</l>
     <l n="175">Say that the crime is common — shall I take</l>
     <l n="176">A common man my wedded lord to make ?</l>
     <l n="177">See ? a weak woman by his arts betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="178">An infant born his father to upbraid ;</l>
     <l n="179">Shall I forgive his vileness , take his name ,</l>
     <l n="180">Sanction his error , and partake his shame ?</l>
     <l n="181">No ! this assent would kindred frailty prove ,</l>
     <l n="182">A love for him would be a vicious love :</l>
     <l n="183">Can a chaste maiden secret counsel hold</l>
     <l n="184">With one whose crime by every mouth is told ?</l>
     <l n="185">Forbid it spirit , prudence , virtuous pride ;</l>
     <l n="186">He must despise me , were he not denied :</l>
     <l n="187">The way from vice the erring mind to win</l>
     <l n="188">Is with presuming sinners to begin ,</l>
     <l n="189">And show , by scorning them , a just contempt for sin . ”</l>
     <l n="190">The youth , repulsed , to one more mild convey 'd</l>
     <l n="191">His heart , and smiled on the remorseless maid ;</l>
     <l n="192">The maid , remorseless , in her pride , the while</l>
     <l n="193">Despised the insult , and return 'd the smile .</l>
     <l n="194">First to admire , to praise her , and defend ,</l>
     <l n="195">Was ( now in years advanced ) a virgin-friend :</l>
     <l n="196">Much she preferr 'd , she cried the single state ,</l>
     <l n="197">“ It was her choice ” — it surely was her fate ;</l>
     <l n="198">And much it pleased her in the train to view</l>
     <l n="199">A maiden vot'ress , wise and lovely too .</l>
     <l n="200">Time to the yielding mind his change imparts ,</l>
     <l n="201">He varies notions , and he alters hearts ;</l>
     <l n="202">‘ Tis right , ‘ tis just to feel contempt for vice ,</l>
     <l n="203">But he that shows it may be over-nice :</l>
     <l n="204">There are who feel , when young , the false sublime ,</l>
     <l n="205">And proudly love to show disdain for crime ;</l>
     <l n="206">To whom the future will new thoughts supply ,</l>
     <l n="207">The pride will soften , and the scorn will die ;</l>
     <l n="208">Nay , where they still the vice itself condemn ,</l>
     <l n="209">They bear the vicious , and consort with them :</l>
     <l n="210">Young Captain Grove , when one had changed his side ,</l>
     <l n="211">Despised the venal turncoat , and defied ;</l>
     <l n="212">Old Colonel Grove now shakes him by the hand ,</l>
     <l n="213">Though he who bribes may still his vote command .</l>
     <l n="214">Why would not Ellen to Belinda speak ,</l>
     <l n="215">When she had flown to London for a week ,</l>
     <l n="216">And then return 'd , to every friend 's surprise ,</l>
     <l n="217">With twice the spirit , and with half the size ?</l>
     <l n="218">She spoke not then — but , after years had flown ,</l>
     <l n="219">A better friend had Ellen never known :</l>
     <l n="220">Was it the lady her mistake had seen ?</l>
     <l n="221">Or had she too on such a journey been ?</l>
     <l n="222">No : ‘ twas the gradual change in human hearts ,</l>
     <l n="223">That time , in commerce with the world , imparts ;</l>
     <l n="224">That on the roughest temper throws disguise ,</l>
     <l n="225">And steals from virtue her asperities .</l>
     <l n="226">The young and ardent , who with glowing zeal</l>
     <l n="227">Felt wrath for trifles , and were proud to feel ,</l>
     <l n="228">Now find those trifles all the mind engage ,</l>
     <l n="229">To soothe dull hours , and cheat the cares of age ;</l>
     <l n="230">As young Zelinda , in her quaker-dress ,</l>
     <l n="231">Disdain 'd each varying fashion 's vile excess ,</l>
     <l n="232">And now her friends on old Zelinda gaze ,</l>
     <l n="233">Pleased in rich silks and orient gems to blaze :</l>
     <l n="234">Changes like these ‘ tis folly to condemn ,</l>
     <l n="235">So virtue yields not , nor is changed with them .</l>
     <l n="236">Let us proceed : — Twelve brilliant years were past ,</l>
     <l n="237">Yet each with less of glory than the last .</l>
     <l n="238">Whether these years to this fair virgin gave</l>
     <l n="239">A softer mind — effect they often have ;</l>
     <l n="240">Whether the virgin-state was not so bless 'd</l>
     <l n="241">As that good maiden in her zeal profess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="242">Or whether lovers falling from her train ,</l>
     <l n="243">Gave greater price to those she could retain ,</l>
     <l n="244">Is all unknown ;— but Arabella now</l>
     <l n="245">Was kindly listening to a Merchant 's vow ,</l>
     <l n="246">Who offer 'd terms so fair , against his love</l>
     <l n="247">To strive was folly , so she never strove . -</l>
     <l n="248">Man in his earlier days we often find</l>
     <l n="249">With a too easy and unguarded mind ;</l>
     <l n="250">But by increasing years and prudence taught ,</l>
     <l n="251">He grows reserved , and locks up every thought :</l>
     <l n="252">Not thus the maiden , for in blooming youth</l>
     <l n="253">She hides her thought and guards the tender truth :</l>
     <l n="254">This , when no longer young , no more she hides ,</l>
     <l n="255">But frankly in the favour 'd swain confides :</l>
     <l n="256">Man , stubborn man , is like the growing tree ,</l>
     <l n="257">That , longer standing , still will harder be ;</l>
     <l n="258">And like its fruit , the virgin , first austere ,</l>
     <l n="259">Then kindly softening with the ripening year .</l>
     <l n="260">Now was the lover urgent , and the kind</l>
     <l n="261">And yielding lady to his suit inclined :</l>
     <l n="262">“ A little time , my friend , is just , is right ;</l>
     <l n="263">We must be decent in our neighbours ’ sight : ”</l>
     <l n="264">Still she allow 'd him of his hopes to speak ,</l>
     <l n="265">And in compassion took off week by week ;</l>
     <l n="266">Till few remain 'd , when , wearied with delay ,</l>
     <l n="267">She kindly meant to take off day by day .</l>
     <l n="268">That female Friend who gave our virgin praise</l>
     <l n="269">For flying man and all his treacherous ways ,</l>
     <l n="270">Now heard with mingled anger , shame , and fear</l>
     <l n="271">Of one accepted , and a wedding near ;</l>
     <l n="272">But she resolved again with friendly zeal</l>
     <l n="273">To make the maid her scorn of wedlock feel ;</l>
     <l n="274">For she was grieved to find her work undone ,</l>
     <l n="275">And like a sister mourn 'd the failing nun .</l>
     <l n="276">Why are these gentle maidens prone to make</l>
     <l n="277">Their sister-doves the tempting world forsake ?</l>
     <l n="278">Why all their triumph when a maid disdains</l>
     <l n="279">The tyrant sex , aud scorns to wear its chains ?</l>
     <l n="280">Is it pure joy to see a sister flown</l>
     <l n="281">From the false pleasures they themselves have known :</l>
     <l n="282">Or do they , as the call-birds in the cage ,</l>
     <l n="283">Try , in pure envy , others to engage ?</l>
     <l n="284">And therefore paint their native woods and groves ,</l>
     <l n="285">As scenes of dangerous joys and naughty loves ?</l>
     <l n="286">Strong was the maiden 's hope ; her friend was proud ,</l>
     <l n="287">And had her notions to the world avow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="288">And , could she find the Merchant weak and frail ,</l>
     <l n="289">With power to prove it , then she must prevail :</l>
     <l n="290">For she aloud would publish his disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="291">And save his victim from a man so base .</l>
     <l n="292">When all inquiries had been duly made ,</l>
     <l n="293">Came the kind Friend her burthen to unlade : -</l>
     <l n="294">“ Alas ! my dear ! not all our care and art</l>
     <l n="295">Can thread the maze of man 's deceitful heart ;</l>
     <l n="296">Look not surprised — nor let resentment swell</l>
     <l n="297">Those lovely features , all will yet be well ;</l>
     <l n="298">And thou , from love 's and man 's deceptions free ,</l>
     <l n="299">Wilt dwell in virgin-state , and walk to Heaven with me . ”</l>
     <l n="300">The Maiden frown 'd , and then conceived “ that wives</l>
     <l n="301">Could walk as well , and lead as holy lives ,</l>
     <l n="302">As angry prudes who scorn 'd the marriage-chain ,</l>
     <l n="303">Or luckless maids , who sought it still in vain . ”</l>
     <l n="304">The Friend was vex 'd — she paused ; at length she cried ,</l>
     <l n="305">“ Know your own danger , then your lot decide :</l>
     <l n="306">That traitor Beswell , while he seeks your hand ,</l>
     <l n="307">Has , I affirm , a wanton at command ;</l>
     <l n="308">A slave , a creature from a foreign place ,</l>
     <l n="309">The nurse and mother of a spurious race ;</l>
     <l n="310">Brown ugly bastards ( Heaven the word forgive ,</l>
     <l n="311">And the deed punish ! ) in his cottage live ;</l>
     <l n="312">To town if business calls him , there he stays</l>
     <l n="313">In sinful pleasures wasting countless days .</l>
     <l n="314">Nor doubt the facts , for I can witness call ,</l>
     <l n="315">For every crime , and prove them one and all . ”</l>
     <l n="316">Here ceased th ’ informer ; Arabella 's look</l>
     <l n="317">Was like a schoolboy 's puzzled by his book ;</l>
     <l n="318">Intent she cast her eyes upon the floor ,</l>
     <l n="319">Paused — then replied -</l>
     <l n="320">“ I wish to know no more :</l>
     <l n="321">I question not your motive , zeal , or love ,</l>
     <l n="322">But must decline such dubious points to prove .</l>
     <l n="323">All is not true , I judge , for who can guess</l>
     <l n="324">Those deeds of darkness men with care suppress ?</l>
     <l n="325">He brought a slave perhaps to England 's coast ,</l>
     <l n="326">And made her free ; it is our country 's boast !</l>
     <l n="327">And she perchance too grateful — good and ill</l>
     <l n="328">Were sown at first , and grow together still ;</l>
     <l n="329">The colour 'd infants on the village green ,</l>
     <l n="330">What are they more than we have often seen ?</l>
     <l n="331">Children half-clothed who round their village stray ,</l>
     <l n="332">In sun or rain , now starved , now beaten , they</l>
     <l n="333">Will the dark colour of their fate betray :</l>
     <l n="334">Let us in Christian love for all account ,</l>
     <l n="335">And then behold to what such tales amount . ”</l>
     <l n="336">“ His heart is evil , ” said the impatient Friend :</l>
     <l n="337">“ My duty bids me try that heart to mend , ”</l>
     <l n="338">Replied the virgin ; “ we may be too nice</l>
     <l n="339">And lose a soul in our contempt of vice ;</l>
     <l n="340">If false the charge , I then shall show regard</l>
     <l n="341">For a good man , and be his just reward :</l>
     <l n="342">And what for virtue can I better do</l>
     <l n="343">Than to reclaim him , if the charge be true ? ”</l>
     <l n="344">She spoke , nor more her holy work delay 'd ;</l>
     <l n="345">‘ Twas time to lend an erring mortal aid :</l>
     <l n="346">“ The noblest way , ” she judged , “ a soul to win ,</l>
     <l n="347">Was with an act of kindness to begin ,</l>
     <l n="348">To make the sinner sure , and then t'attack the sin . ” { 3 }</l>

     <l n="10">Which now shows all her beauty to the sun ,</l>

     <l n="12">Two Gentlemen of Verona .</l>

     <l n="13">And happily I have arrived at last</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="16">It is the Soul that sees : the outward eyes</l>
     <l n="17">Present the object , but the Mind descries ;</l>
     <l n="18">And thence delight , disgust , or cool indiff'rence rise :</l>
     <l n="19">When minds are joyful , then we look around ,</l>
     <l n="20">And what is seen is all on fairy ground ;</l>
     <l n="21">Again they sicken , and on every view</l>
     <l n="22">Cast their own dull and melancholy hue ;</l>
     <l n="23">Or , if absorb 'd by their peculiar cares ,</l>
     <l n="24">The vacant eye on viewless matter glares ,</l>
     <l n="25">Our feelings still upon our views attend ,</l>
     <l n="26">And their own natures to the objects lend :</l>
     <l n="27">Sorrow and joy are in their influence sure ,</l>
     <l n="28">Long as the passion reigns th ’ effects endure ;</l>
     <l n="29">But Love in minds his various changes makes ,</l>
     <l n="30">And clothes each object with the change he takes ;</l>
     <l n="31">His light and shade on every view he throws ,</l>
     <l n="32">And on each object what he feels bestows .</l>
     <l n="33">Fair was the morning , and the month was June ,</l>
     <l n="34">When rose a Lover ;— love awakens soon :</l>
     <l n="35">Brief his repose , yet much he dreamt the while</l>
     <l n="36">Of that day 's meeting , and his Laura 's smile :</l>
     <l n="37">Fancy and love that name assign 'd to her ,</l>
     <l n="38">Call 'd Susan in the parish-register ;</l>
     <l n="39">And he no more was John — his Laura gave</l>
     <l n="40">The name Orlando to her faithful slave .</l>
     <l n="41">Bright shone the glory of the rising day ,</l>
     <l n="42">When the fond traveller took his favourite way ;</l>
     <l n="43">He mounted gaily , felt his bosom light ,</l>
     <l n="44">And all he saw was pleasing in his sight .</l>
     <l n="45">“ Ye hours of expectation , quickly fly ,</l>
     <l n="46">And bring on hours of bless 'd reality ;</l>
     <l n="47">When I shall Laura see , beside her stand ,</l>
     <l n="48">Hear her sweet voice , and press her yielded hand . ”</l>
     <l n="49">First o'er a barren heath beside the coast</l>
     <l n="50">Orlando rode , and joy began to boast .</l>
     <l n="51">“ This neat low gorse , ” said he , “ with golden bloom ,</l>
     <l n="52">Delights each sense , is beauty , is perfume ;</l>
     <l n="53">And this gay ling , with all its purple flowers ,</l>
     <l n="54">A man at leisure might admire for hours ;</l>
     <l n="55">This green-fringed cup-moss has a scarlet tip ,</l>
     <l n="56">That yields to nothing but my Laura 's lip ;</l>
     <l n="57">And then how fine this herbage ! men may say</l>
     <l n="58">A heath is barren ; nothing is so gay :</l>
     <l n="59">Barren or bare to call such charming scene</l>
     <l n="60">Argues a mind possess 'd by care and spleen . ”</l>
     <l n="61">Onward he went , and fiercer grew the heat ,</l>
     <l n="62">Dust rose in clouds before the horse 's feet ;</l>
     <l n="63">For now he pass 'd through lanes of burning sand ,</l>
     <l n="64">Bounds to thin crops or yet uncultured land ;</l>
     <l n="65">Where the dark poppy flourish 'd on the dry</l>
     <l n="66">And sterile soil , and mock 'd the thin-set rye .</l>
     <l n="67">“ How lovely this ! ” the rapt Orlando said ;</l>
     <l n="68">“ With what delight is labouring man repaid !</l>
     <l n="69">The very lane has sweets that all admire ,</l>
     <l n="70">The rambling suckling , and the vigorous brier ;</l>
     <l n="71">See ! wholesome wormwood grows beside the way ,</l>
     <l n="72">Where dew-press 'd yet the dog-rose bends the spray ;</l>
     <l n="73">Fresh herbs the fields , fair shrubs the banks adorn ,</l>
     <l n="74">And snow-white bloom falls flaky from the thorn ;</l>
     <l n="75">No fostering hand they need , no sheltering wall ,</l>
     <l n="76">They spring uncultured , and they bloom for all . ”</l>
     <l n="77">The Lover rode as hasty lovers ride ,</l>
     <l n="78">And reach 'd a common pasture wild and wide ;</l>
     <l n="79">Small black-legg 'd sheep devour with hunger keen</l>
     <l n="80">The meagre herbage , fleshless , lank , and lean :</l>
     <l n="81">Such o'er thy level turf , Newmarket ! stray ,</l>
     <l n="82">And there , with other black-legs , find their prey .</l>
     <l n="83">He saw some scatter 'd hovels ; turf was piled</l>
     <l n="84">In square brown stacks ; a prospect bleak and wild !</l>
     <l n="85">A mill , indeed , was in the centre found ,</l>
     <l n="86">With short sear herbage withering all around ;</l>
     <l n="87">A smith 's black shed opposed a wright 's long shop ,</l>
     <l n="88">And join 'd an inn where humble travellers stop .</l>
     <l n="89">“ Ay , this is Nature , ” said the gentle ‘ Squire ;</l>
     <l n="90">“ This ease , peace , pleasure — who would not admire ?</l>
     <l n="91">With what delight these sturdy children play ,</l>
     <l n="92">And joyful rustics at the close of day ;</l>
     <l n="93">Sport follows labour ; on this even space</l>
     <l n="94">Will soon commence the wrestling and the race ;</l>
     <l n="95">Then will the village-maidens leave their home ,</l>
     <l n="96">And to the dance with buoyant spirits come ;</l>
     <l n="97">No affectation in their looks is seen ,</l>
     <l n="98">Nor know they what disguise aud flattery mean ;</l>
     <l n="99">Nor aught to move an envious pang they see ,</l>
     <l n="100">Easy their service , and their love is free ;</l>
     <l n="101">Hence early springs that love , it long endures ,</l>
     <l n="102">And life 's first comfort , while they live , ensures :</l>
     <l n="103">They the low roof and rustic comforts prize ,</l>
     <l n="104">Nor cast on prouder mansions envying eyes :</l>
     <l n="105">Sometimes the news at yonder town they hear ,</l>
     <l n="106">And learn what busier mortals feel and fear ;</l>
     <l n="107">Secure themselves , although by tales amazed</l>
     <l n="108">Of towns bombarded and of cities razed ;</l>
     <l n="109">As if they doubted , in their still retreat ,</l>
     <l n="110">The very news that makes their quiet sweet ,</l>
     <l n="111">And their days happy — happier only knows</l>
     <l n="112">He on whom Laura her regard bestows . ”</l>
     <l n="113">On rode Orlando , counting all the while</l>
     <l n="114">The miles he pass 'd , and every coming mile ;</l>
     <l n="115">Like all attracted things , he quicker flies ,</l>
     <l n="116">The place approaching where th ’ attraction lies ;</l>
     <l n="117">When next appear 'd a dam — so call the place -</l>
     <l n="118">Where lies a road confined in narrow space ;</l>
     <l n="119">A work of labour , for on either side</l>
     <l n="120">Is level fen , a prospect wild and wide ,</l>
     <l n="121">With dikes on either hand by ocean 's self supplied :</l>
     <l n="122">Far on the right the distant sea is seen ,</l>
     <l n="123">And salt the springs that feed the marsh between :</l>
     <l n="124">Beneath an ancient bridge , the straiten 'd flood</l>
     <l n="125">Rolls through its sloping banks of slimy mud ;</l>
     <l n="126">Near it a sunken boat resists the tide ,</l>
     <l n="127">That frets and hurries to th ’ opposing side ;</l>
     <l n="128">The rushes sharp , that on the borders grow ,</l>
     <l n="129">Bend their brown flow'rets to the stream below ,</l>
     <l n="130">Impure in all its course , in all its progress slow :</l>
     <l n="131">Here a grave Flora scarcely deigns to bloom ,</l>
     <l n="132">Nor wears a rosy blush , nor sheds perfume :</l>
     <l n="133">The few dull flowers that o'er the place are spread</l>
     <l n="134">Partake the nature of their fenny bed ;</l>
     <l n="135">Here on its wiry stem , in rigid bloom ,</l>
     <l n="136">Grows the salt lavender that lacks perfume ;</l>
     <l n="137">Here the dwarf sallows creep , the septfoil harsh ,</l>
     <l n="138">And the soft slimy mallow of the marsh ;</l>
     <l n="139">Low on the ear the distant billows sound ,</l>
     <l n="140">And just in view appears their stony bound ;</l>
     <l n="141">No hedge nor tree conceals the glowing sun ,</l>
     <l n="142">Birds , save a wat'ry tribe , the district shun ,</l>
     <l n="143">Nor chirp among the reeds where bitter waters run .</l>
     <l n="144">“ Various as beauteous , Nature , is thy face , ”</l>
     <l n="145">Exclaim 'd Orlando : “ all that grows has grace :</l>
     <l n="146">All are appropriate — bog , and marsh , and fen ,</l>
     <l n="147">Are only poor to undiscerning men ;</l>
     <l n="148">Here may the nice and curious eye explore</l>
     <l n="149">How Nature 's hand adorns the rushy moor ;</l>
     <l n="150">Here the rare moss in secret shade is found ,</l>
     <l n="151">Here the sweet myrtle of the shaking ground ;</l>
     <l n="152">Beauties are these that from the view retire ,</l>
     <l n="153">But well repay th ’ attention they require ;</l>
     <l n="154">For these my Laura will her home forsake ,</l>
     <l n="155">And all the pleasures they afford partake . ”</l>
     <l n="156">Again , the country was enclosed , a wide</l>
     <l n="157">And sandy road has banks on either side ;</l>
     <l n="158">Where , lo ! a hollow on the left appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="159">And there a gipsy tribe their tent had rear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="160">‘ Twas open spread , to catch the morning sun ,</l>
     <l n="161">And they had now their early meal begun ,</l>
     <l n="162">When two brown boys just left their grassy seat ,</l>
     <l n="163">The early Trav'ller with their prayers to greet :</l>
     <l n="164">While yet Orlando held his pence in hand ,</l>
     <l n="165">He saw their sister on her duty stand ;</l>
     <l n="166">Some twelve years old , demure , affected , sly ,</l>
     <l n="167">Prepared the force of early powers to try ;</l>
     <l n="168">Sudden a look of languor he descries ,</l>
     <l n="169">And well-feign 'd apprehension in her eyes ;</l>
     <l n="170">Train 'd but yet savage , in her speaking face</l>
     <l n="171">He mark 'd the features of her vagrant race ;</l>
     <l n="172">When a light laugh and roguish leer express 'd</l>
     <l n="173">The vice implanted in her youthful breast :</l>
     <l n="174">Forth from the tent her elder brother came ,</l>
     <l n="175">Who seem 'd offended , yet forbore to blame</l>
     <l n="176">The young designer , but could only trace</l>
     <l n="177">The looks of pity in the trav'ller ' s face :</l>
     <l n="178">Within , the Father , who from fences nigh</l>
     <l n="179">Had brought the fuel for the fire 's supply ,</l>
     <l n="180">Watch 'd now the feeble blaze , and stood dejected by .</l>
     <l n="181">On ragged rug , just borrow 'd from the bed ,</l>
     <l n="182">And by the hand of coarse indulgence fed ,</l>
     <l n="183">In dirty patchwork negligently dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="184">Reclined the Wife , an infant at her breast ;</l>
     <l n="185">In her wild face some touch of grace remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="186">Of vigour palsied and of beauty stain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="187">Her bloodshot eyes on her unheeding mate</l>
     <l n="188">Were wrathful turn 'd , and seem 'd her wants to state ,</l>
     <l n="189">Cursing his tardy aid — her Mother there</l>
     <l n="190">With gipsy-state engross 'd the only chair ;</l>
     <l n="191">Solemn and dull her look ; with such she stands ,</l>
     <l n="192">And reads the milk-maid 's fortune in her hands ,</l>
     <l n="193">Tracing the lines of life ; assumed through years ,</l>
     <l n="194">Each feature now the steady falsehood wears ;</l>
     <l n="195">With hard and savage eye she views the food ,</l>
     <l n="196">And grudging pinches their intruding brood ;</l>
     <l n="197">Last in the group , the worn-out Grandsire sits</l>
     <l n="198">Neglected , lost , and living but by fits :</l>
     <l n="199">Useless , despised , his worthless labours done ,</l>
     <l n="200">And half protected by the vicious Son ,</l>
     <l n="201">Who half supports him ; he with heavy glance</l>
     <l n="202">Views the young ruffians who around him dance ;</l>
     <l n="203">And , by the sadness in his face , appears</l>
     <l n="204">To trace the progress of their future years :</l>
     <l n="205">Through what strange course of misery , vice , deceit ,</l>
     <l n="206">Must wildly wander each unpractised cheat !</l>
     <l n="207">What shame and grief , what punishment and pain ,</l>
     <l n="208">Sport of fierce passions , must each child sustain -</l>
     <l n="209">Ere they like him approach their latter end ,</l>
     <l n="210">Without a hope , a comfort , or a friend !</l>
     <l n="211">But this Orlando felt not ; “ Rogues , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="212">“ Doubtless they are , but merry rogues they be ;</l>
     <l n="213">They wander round the land , and be it true</l>
     <l n="214">They break the laws — then let the laws pursue</l>
     <l n="215">The wanton idlers ; for the life they live ,</l>
     <l n="216">Acquit I cannot , but I can forgive . ”</l>
     <l n="217">This said , a portion from his purse was thrown ,</l>
     <l n="218">And every heart seem 'd happy like his own .</l>
     <l n="219">He hurried forth , for now the town was nigh -</l>
     <l n="220">“ The happiest man of mortal men am I . ”</l>
     <l n="221">Thou art ! but change in every state is near</l>
     <l n="222">( So while the wretched hope , the bless 'd may fear ):</l>
     <l n="223">“ Say , Where is Laura ? ” — “ That her words must show , ”</l>
     <l n="224">A lass replied ; “ read this , and thou shalt know ! ”</l>
     <l n="225">“ What , gone !— ‘ Her friend insisted — forced to go :</l>
     <l n="226">Is vex 'd , was teased , could not refuse her ’ — No ?</l>
     <l n="227">‘ But you can follow . ’ Yes ! ‘ The miles are few ,</l>
     <l n="228">The way is pleasant ; will you come ?— Adieu !</l>
     <l n="229">Thy Laura ! ’ No ! I feel I must resign</l>
     <l n="230">The pleasing hope ; thou hadst been here , if mine .</l>
     <l n="231">A lady was it ?— Was no brother there ?</l>
     <l n="232">But why should I afflict me , if there were ?</l>
     <l n="233">‘ The way is pleasant . ’ What to me the way ?</l>
     <l n="234">I cannot reach her till the close of day .</l>
     <l n="235">My dumb companion ! Is it thus we speed ?</l>
     <l n="236">Not I from grief nor thou from toil art freed ;</l>
     <l n="237">Still art thou doom 'd to travel and to pine ,</l>
     <l n="238">For my vexation — What a fate is mine !</l>
     <l n="239">“ Gone to a friend , she tells me ;— I commend</l>
     <l n="240">Her purpose : means she to a female friend ?</l>
     <l n="241">By Heaven , I wish she suffer 'd half the pain</l>
     <l n="242">Of hope protracted through the day in vain .</l>
     <l n="243">Shall I persist to see th ’ ungrateful maid ?</l>
     <l n="244">Yes , I will see her , slight her , and upbraid .</l>
     <l n="245">What ! in the very hour ? She knew the time ,</l>
     <l n="246">And doubtless chose it to increase her crime . ”</l>
     <l n="247">Forth rode Orlando by a river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="248">Inland and winding , smooth , and full , and wide ,</l>
     <l n="249">That roll 'd majestic on , in one soft-flowing tide ;</l>
     <l n="250">The bottom gravel , flow'ry were the banks ,</l>
     <l n="251">Tall willows waving in their broken ranks ;</l>
     <l n="252">The road , now near , now distant , winding led</l>
     <l n="253">By lovely meadows which the waters fed ;</l>
     <l n="254">He pass 'd the way-side inn , the village spire ,</l>
     <l n="255">Nor stopp 'd to gaze , to question or admire ;</l>
     <l n="256">On either side the rural mansions stood ,</l>
     <l n="257">With hedge-row trees , and hills , high-crown 'd with wood ,</l>
     <l n="258">And many a devious stream that reach 'd the nobler flood .</l>
     <l n="259">“ I hate these scenes , ” Orlando angry cried ,</l>
     <l n="260">“ And these proud farmers ! yes I hate their pride ,</l>
     <l n="261">See ! that sleek fellow , how he strides along ,</l>
     <l n="262">Strong as an ox , and ignorant as strong ;</l>
     <l n="263">Can yon close crops a single eye detain</l>
     <l n="264">But he who counts the profits of the grain ?</l>
     <l n="265">And these vile beans with deleterious smell ,</l>
     <l n="266">Where is there beauty ? can a mortal tell ?</l>
     <l n="267">These deep fat meadows I detest ; it shocks</l>
     <l n="268">One 's feelings there to see the grazing ox ; -</l>
     <l n="269">For slaughter fatted , as a lady 's smile</l>
     <l n="270">Rejoices man , and means his death the while .</l>
     <l n="271">Lo ! now the sons of labour ! every day</l>
     <l n="272">Employ 'd in toil and vex 'd in every way ;</l>
     <l n="273">Theirs is but mirth assumed , and they conceal ,</l>
     <l n="274">In their affected joys , the ills they feel :</l>
     <l n="275">I hate these long green lanes ; there 's nothing sees</l>
     <l n="276">In this vile country but eternal green ;</l>
     <l n="277">Woods ! waters ! meadows ! Will they never end ?</l>
     <l n="278">‘ Tis a vile prospect : — Gone to see a friend ? ”</l>
     <l n="279">Still on he rode ! a mansion fair and tall</l>
     <l n="280">Rose on his view — the pride of Loddon Hall :</l>
     <l n="281">Spread o'er the park he saw the grazing steer ,</l>
     <l n="282">The full-fed steed , and herds of bounding deer :</l>
     <l n="283">On a clear stream the vivid sunbeams play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="284">Through noble elms , and on the surface made</l>
     <l n="285">That moving picture , checker 'd light and shade ;</l>
     <l n="286">Th ’ attended children , there indulged to stray ,</l>
     <l n="287">Enjoy 'd and gave new beauty to the day ;</l>
     <l n="288">Whose happy parents from their room were seen</l>
     <l n="289">Pleased with the sportive idlers on the green .</l>
     <l n="290">“ Well ! ” said Orlando , “ and for one so bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="291">A thousand reasoning wretches are distressed ;</l>
     <l n="292">Nay , these , so seeming glad , are grieving like the rest :</l>
     <l n="293">Man is a cheat — and all but strive to hide</l>
     <l n="294">Their inward misery by their outward pride .</l>
     <l n="295">What do yon lofty gates and walls contain ,</l>
     <l n="296">But fruitless means to sooth unconquer 'd pain ?</l>
     <l n="297">The parents read each infant daughter 's smile ,</l>
     <l n="298">Form 'd to seduce , encouraged to beguile ;</l>
     <l n="299">They view the boys unconscious of their fate ,</l>
     <l n="300">Sure to be tempted , sure to take the bait ;</l>
     <l n="301">These will be Lauras , sad Orlandos these -</l>
     <l n="302">There 's guilt and grief in all one hears and sees . ”</l>
     <l n="303">Our Trav'ller , lab'ring up a hill , look 'd down</l>
     <l n="304">Upon a lively , busy , pleasant town ;</l>
     <l n="305">All he beheld were there alert , alive ,</l>
     <l n="306">The busiest bees that ever stock 'd a hive :</l>
     <l n="307">A pair were married , and the bells aloud</l>
     <l n="308">Proclaim 'd their joy , and joyful seem 'd the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="309">And now , proceeding on his way , he spied ,</l>
     <l n="310">Bound by strong ties , the bridegroom and the bride ,</l>
     <l n="311">Each by some friends attended , near they drew ,</l>
     <l n="312">And spleen beheld them with prophetic view .</l>
     <l n="313">“ Married ! nay mad ! ” Orlando cried in scorn ;</l>
     <l n="314">“ Another wretch on this unlucky morn :</l>
     <l n="315">What are this foolish mirth , these idle joys ?</l>
     <l n="316">Attempts to stifle doubt and fear by noise :</l>
     <l n="317">To me these robes , expressive of delight ,</l>
     <l n="318">Foreshow distress , and only grief excite ;</l>
     <l n="319">And for these cheerful friends , will they behold</l>
     <l n="320">Their wailing brood in sickness , want , and cold ;</l>
     <l n="321">And his proud look , and her soft languid air</l>
     <l n="322">Will — but I spare you — go , unhappy pair ! ”</l>
     <l n="323">And now , approaching to the Journey 's end ,</l>
     <l n="324">His anger fails , his thoughts to kindness tend ,</l>
     <l n="325">He less offended feels , and rather fears t'offend :</l>
     <l n="326">Now gently rising , hope contends with doubt ,</l>
     <l n="327">And casts a sunshine on the views without ;</l>
     <l n="328">And still reviving joy and lingering gloom</l>
     <l n="329">Alternate empire o'er his soul assume ;</l>
     <l n="330">Till , long perplex 'd he now began to find</l>
     <l n="331">The softer thoughts engross the settling mind :</l>
     <l n="332">He saw the mansion , and should quickly see</l>
     <l n="333">His Laura 's self — and angry could he be ?</l>
     <l n="334">No ! the resentment melted all away -</l>
     <l n="335">“ For this my grief a single smile will pay , ”</l>
     <l n="336">Our trav'ller cried ;— “ And why should it offend ,</l>
     <l n="337">That one so good should have a pressing friend ?</l>
     <l n="338">Grieve not , my heart ! to find a favourite guest</l>
     <l n="339">Thy pride and boast — ye selfish sorrows rest ;</l>
     <l n="340">She will be kind , and I again be bless 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="341">While gentler passions thus his bosom sway 'd</l>
     <l n="342">He reach 'd the mansion , and he saw the maid ;</l>
     <l n="343">“ My Laura ! ” — “ My Orlando !— this is kind ;</l>
     <l n="344">In truth I came persuaded , not inclined :</l>
     <l n="345">Our friends ’ amusement let us now pursue ,</l>
     <l n="346">And I to-morrow will return with you . ”</l>
     <l n="347">Like man entranced the happy Lover stood -</l>
     <l n="348">“ As Laura wills , for she is kind and good ;</l>
     <l n="349">Ever the truest , gentlest , fairest , best -</l>
     <l n="350">As Laura wills : I see her and am bless 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="351">Home went the Lovers through that busy place ,</l>
     <l n="352">By Loddon Hall , the country 's pride and grace ;</l>
     <l n="353">By the rich meadows where the oxen fed ,</l>
     <l n="354">Through the green vale that form 'd the river 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="355">And by unnumber 'd cottages and farms ,</l>
     <l n="356">That have for musing minds unnumbered charms ;</l>
     <l n="357">And how affected by the view of these</l>
     <l n="358">Was then Orlando ? did they pain or please ?</l>
     <l n="359">Nor pain nor pleasure could they yield — and why ?</l>
     <l n="360">The mind was fill 'd , was happy , and the eye</l>
     <l n="361">Roved o'er the fleeting views , that but appear 'd to die .</l>
     <l n="362">Alone Orlando on the morrow paced</l>
     <l n="363">The well-known road ; the gipsy-tent he traced ;</l>
     <l n="364">The dam high-raised , the reedy dikes between ,</l>
     <l n="365">The scatter 'd hovels on the barren green ,</l>
     <l n="366">The burning sand , the fields of thin-set rye ,</l>
     <l n="367">Mock 'd by the useless Flora blooming by ;</l>
     <l n="368">And last the heath with all its various bloom ,</l>
     <l n="369">And the close lanes that led the trav'ller home .</l>
     <l n="370">Then could these scenes the former joys renew ?</l>
     <l n="371">Or was there now dejection in the view ? -</l>
     <l n="372">Nor one or other would they yield — and why ?</l>
     <l n="373">The mind was absent , and the vacant eye</l>
     <l n="374">Wander 'd o'er viewless scenes , that but appear 'd to die .</l>

     <l n="29">And in the service of the conqu'ror live ;</l>
     <l n="30">Like captive Samson making sport for all ,</l>
     <l n="31">Who fear 'd their strength , and glory in their fall .</l>
     <l n="32">Genius , with virtue , still may lack the aid</l>
     <l n="33">Implored by humble minds , and hearts afraid ;</l>
     <l n="34">May leave to timid souls the shield and sword</l>
     <l n="35">Of the tried Faith , and the resistless Word ;</l>
     <l n="36">Amid a world of dangers venturing forth ,</l>
     <l n="37">Frail , but yet fearless , proud in conscious worth ,</l>
     <l n="38">Till strong temptation , in some fatal time ,</l>
     <l n="39">Assails the heart , and wins the soul to crime ,</l>
     <l n="40">When left by honour , and by sorrow spent ,</l>
     <l n="41">Unused to pray , unable to repent ,</l>
     <l n="42">The nobler powers , that once exalted high</l>
     <l n="43">Th ’ aspiring man , shall then degraded lie :</l>
     <l n="44">Reason , through anguish , shall her throne forsake ,</l>

     <l n="46">When Edward Shore had reach 'd his twentieth year ,</l>
     <l n="47">He felt his bosom light , his conscience clear ;</l>
     <l n="48">Applause at school the youthful hero gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="49">And trials there with manly strength sustain 'd :</l>
     <l n="50">With prospects bright upon the world he came ,</l>
     <l n="51">Pure love of virtue , strong desire of fame :</l>
     <l n="52">Men watch 'd the way his lofty mind would take ,</l>
     <l n="53">And all foretold the progress he would make .</l>
     <l n="54">Boast of these friends , to older men a guide ,</l>
     <l n="55">Proud of his parts , but gracious in his pride ;</l>
     <l n="56">He bore a gay good-nature in his face ,</l>
     <l n="57">And in his air were dignity and grace ;</l>
     <l n="58">Dress that became his state and years he wore ,</l>
     <l n="59">And sense and spirit shone in Edward Shore .</l>
     <l n="60">Thus , while admiring friends the Youth beheld ,</l>
     <l n="61">His own disgust their forward hopes repell 'd ;</l>
     <l n="62">For he unfix 'd , unfixing , look 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="63">And no employment but in seeking found ;</l>
     <l n="64">He gave his restless thoughts to views refined ,</l>
     <l n="65">And shrank from worldly cares with wounded mind .</l>
     <l n="66">Rejecting trade , awhile he dwelt on laws ,</l>
     <l n="67">“ But who could plead , if unapproved the cause ? ”</l>
     <l n="68">A doubting , dismal tribe physicians seem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="69">Divines o'er texts and disputations dream 'd ,</l>
     <l n="70">War and its glory he perhaps could love ,</l>
     <l n="71">But there again he must the cause approve .</l>
     <l n="72">Our hero thought no deed should gain applause</l>
     <l n="73">Where timid virtue found support in laws ;</l>
     <l n="74">He to all good would soar , would fly all sin ,</l>
     <l n="75">By the pure prompting of the will within ;</l>
     <l n="76">“ Who needs a law that binds him not to steal , ”</l>
     <l n="77">Ask 'd the young teacher , “ can he rightly feel ?</l>
     <l n="78">To curb the will , or arm in honour 's cause ,</l>
     <l n="79">Or aid the weak — are these enforced by laws ?</l>
     <l n="80">Should we a foul , ungenerous action dread ,</l>
     <l n="81">Because a law condemns th ’ adulterous bed ?</l>
     <l n="82">Or fly pollution , not for fear of stain ,</l>
     <l n="83">But that some statute tells us to refrain ?</l>
     <l n="84">The grosser herd in ties like these we bind ,</l>
     <l n="85">In virtue 's freedom moves th ’ enlighten 'd mind . ”</l>
     <l n="86">“ Man 's heart deceives him , ” said a friend .— “ Of course , ”</l>
     <l n="87">Replied the Youth ; “ but has it power to force ?</l>
     <l n="88">Unless it forces , call it as you will ,</l>
     <l n="89">It is but wish , and proneness to the ill . ”</l>
     <l n="90">“ Art thou not tempted ? ” — “ Do I fall ? ” said Shore .</l>
     <l n="91">“ The pure have fallen . ” — “ Then are pure no more .</l>
     <l n="92">While reason guides me , I shall walk aright ,</l>
     <l n="93">Nor need a steadier hand , or stronger light ;</l>
     <l n="94">Nor this in dread of awful threats , design 'd</l>
     <l n="95">For the weak spirit and the grov'ling mind ;</l>
     <l n="96">But that , engaged by thoughts and views sublime ,</l>
     <l n="97">I wage free war with grossness and with crime . ”</l>
     <l n="98">Thus look 'd he proudly on the vulgar crew ,</l>
     <l n="99">Whom statutes govern , and whom fears subdue .</l>
     <l n="100">Faith , with his virtue , he indeed profess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="101">But doubts deprived his ardent mind of rest ;</l>
     <l n="102">Reason , his sovereign mistress , fail 'd to show</l>
     <l n="103">Light through the mazes of the world below :</l>
     <l n="104">Questions arose , and they surpass 'd the skill</l>
     <l n="105">Of his sole aid , and would be dubious still ;</l>
     <l n="106">These to discuss he sought no common guide ,</l>
     <l n="107">But to the doubters in his doubts applied ;</l>
     <l n="108">When all together might in freedom speak ,</l>
     <l n="109">And their loved truth with mutual ardour seek .</l>
     <l n="110">Alas ! though men who feel their eyes decay</l>
     <l n="111">Take more than common pains to find their way ,</l>
     <l n="112">Yet , when for this they ask each other 's aid ,</l>
     <l n="113">Their mutual purpose is the more delay 'd :</l>
     <l n="114">Of all their doubts , their reasoning clear 'd not one ,</l>
     <l n="115">Still the same spots were present in the sun :</l>
     <l n="116">Still the same scruples haunted Edward 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who found no rest , nor took the means to find .</l>
     <l n="118">But though with shaken faith , and slave to fame ,</l>
     <l n="119">Vain and aspiring on the world he came ,</l>
     <l n="120">Yet was he studious , serious , moral , grave ,</l>
     <l n="121">No passion 's victim , and no system 's slave :</l>
     <l n="122">Vice he opposed , indulgence he disdain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="123">And o'er each sense in conscious triumph reign 'd .</l>
     <l n="124">Who often reads will sometimes wish to write ,</l>
     <l n="125">And Shore would yield instruction and delight :</l>
     <l n="126">A serious drama he design 'd , but found</l>
     <l n="127">‘ Twas tedious travelling in that gloomy ground ;</l>
     <l n="128">A deep and solemn story he would try ,</l>
     <l n="129">But grew ashamed of ghosts , and laid it by ;</l>
     <l n="130">Sermons he wrote , but they who knew his creed ,</l>
     <l n="131">Or knew it not , were ill-disposed to read ;</l>
     <l n="132">And he would lastly be the nation 's guide ,</l>
     <l n="133">But , studying , fail 'd to fix upon a side ;</l>
     <l n="134">Fame he desired , and talents he possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="135">But loved not labour , though he could not rest ,</l>
     <l n="136">Nor firmly fix the vacillating mind ,</l>
     <l n="137">That , ever working , could no centre find .</l>
     <l n="138">‘ Tis thus a sanguine reader loves to trace</l>
     <l n="139">The Nile forth rushing on his glorious race ;</l>
     <l n="140">Calm and secure the fancied traveller goes</l>
     <l n="141">Through sterile deserts and by threat'ning foes ;</l>
     <l n="142">He thinks not then of Afric 's scorching sands ,</l>
     <l n="143">Th ’ Arabian sea , the Abyssinian bands ;</l>
     <l n="144">Fasils and Michaels , and the robbers all , { 4 }</l>
     <l n="145">Whom we politely chiefs and heroes call :</l>
     <l n="146">He of success alone delights to think ,</l>
     <l n="147">He views that fount , he stands upon the brink ,</l>
     <l n="148">And drinks a fancied draught , exulting so to drink .</l>
     <l n="149">In his own room , and with his books around ,</l>
     <l n="150">His lively mind its chief employment found ;</l>
     <l n="151">Then idly busy , quietly employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="152">And , lost to life , his visions were enjoy 'd :</l>
     <l n="153">Yet still he took a keen inquiring view</l>
     <l n="154">Of all that crowds neglect , desire , pursue ;</l>
     <l n="155">And thus abstracted , curious , still , serene ,</l>
     <l n="156">He , unemploy 'd , beheld life 's shifting scene :</l>
     <l n="157">Still more averse from vulgar joys and cares ,</l>
     <l n="158">Still more unfitted for the world 's affairs .</l>
     <l n="159">There was a house where Edward ofttimes went ,</l>
     <l n="160">And social hours in pleasant trifling spent ;</l>
     <l n="161">He read , conversed , and reason 'd , sang and play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="162">And all were happy while the idler stay 'd ;</l>
     <l n="163">Too happy one ! for thence arose the pain ,</l>
     <l n="164">Till this engaging trifler came again .</l>
     <l n="165">But did he love ? We answer , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="166">The loving feet would take th ’ accustom 'd way ,</l>
     <l n="167">The amorous eye would rove as if in quest</l>
     <l n="168">Of something rare , and on the mansion rest ;</l>
     <l n="169">The same soft passion touch 'd the gentle tongue ,</l>
     <l n="170">And Anna 's charms in tender notes were sung ;</l>
     <l n="171">The ear , too , seem 'd to feel the common flame ,</l>
     <l n="172">Soothed and delighted with the fair one 's name ;</l>
     <l n="173">And thus , as love each other part possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="174">The heart , no doubt , its sovereign power confess 'd .</l>
     <l n="175">Pleased in her sight , the Youth required no more ;</l>
     <l n="176">Not rich himself , he saw the damsel poor ;</l>
     <l n="177">And he too wisely , nay , too kindly loved ,</l>
     <l n="178">To pain the being whom his soul approved .</l>
     <l n="179">A serious Friend our cautious Youth possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="180">And at his table sat a welcome guest ;</l>
     <l n="181">Both unemploy 'd , it was their chief delight</l>
     <l n="182">To read what free and daring authors write ;</l>
     <l n="183">Authors who loved from common views to soar ,</l>
     <l n="184">And seek the fountains never traced before :</l>
     <l n="185">Truth they profess 'd , yet often left the true</l>
     <l n="186">And beaten prospect , for the wild and new .</l>
     <l n="187">His chosen friend his fiftieth year had seen ,</l>
     <l n="188">His fortune easy , and his air serene ;</l>
     <l n="189">Deist and atheist call 'd ; for few agreed</l>
     <l n="190">What were his notions , principles , or creed ;</l>
     <l n="191">His mind reposed not , for he hated rest ,</l>
     <l n="192">But all things made a query or a jest ;</l>
     <l n="193">Perplex 'd himself , he ever sought to prove</l>
     <l n="194">That man is doom 'd in endless doubt to rove ;</l>
     <l n="195">Himself in darkness he profess 'd to be ,</l>
     <l n="196">And would maintain that not a man could see .</l>
     <l n="197">The youthful Friend , dissentient , reason 'd still</l>
     <l n="198">Of the soul 's prowess , and the subject-will ;</l>
     <l n="199">Of virtue 's beauty , and of honour 's force ,</l>
     <l n="200">And a warm zeal gave life to his discourse :</l>
     <l n="201">Since from his feelings all his fire arose ,</l>
     <l n="202">And he had interest in the themes he chose .</l>
     <l n="203">The Friend , indulging a sarcastic smile ,</l>
     <l n="204">Said , “ Dear enthusiast ! thou wilt change thy style ,</l>
     <l n="205">When man 's delusions , errors , crimes , deceit ,</l>
     <l n="206">No more distress thee , and no longer cheat . ”</l>
     <l n="207">Yet , lo ! this cautious man , so coolly wise ,</l>
     <l n="208">On a young Beauty fix 'd unguarded eyes ;</l>
     <l n="209">And her he married : Edward at the view</l>
     <l n="210">Bade to his cheerful visits long adieu ;</l>
     <l n="211">But haply err 'd , for this engaging bride</l>
     <l n="212">No mirth suppress 'd , but rather cause supplied :</l>
     <l n="213">And when she saw the friends , by reasoning long ,</l>
     <l n="214">Confused if right , and positive if wrong ,</l>
     <l n="215">With playful speech , and smile that spoke delight ,</l>
     <l n="216">She made them careless both of wrong and right .</l>
     <l n="217">This gentle damsel gave consent to wed ,</l>
     <l n="218">With school and school-day dinners in her head :</l>
     <l n="219">She now was promised choice of daintiest food ,</l>
     <l n="220">And costly dress , that made her sovereign good ;</l>
     <l n="221">With walks on hilly heath to banish spleen ,</l>
     <l n="222">And summer-visits when the roads were clean .</l>
     <l n="223">All these she loved , to these she gave consent ,</l>
     <l n="224">And she was married to her heart 's content .</l>
     <l n="225">Their manner this — the Friends together read ,</l>
     <l n="226">Till books a cause for disputation bred ;</l>
     <l n="227">Debate then follow 'd , and the vapour 'd child</l>
     <l n="228">Declared they argued till her head was wild ;</l>
     <l n="229">And strange to her it was that mortal brain</l>
     <l n="230">Could seek the trial , or endure the pain .</l>
     <l n="231">Then , as the Friend reposed , the younger pair</l>
     <l n="232">Sat down to cards , and play 'd beside his chair ;</l>
     <l n="233">Till he , awaking , to his books applied ,</l>
     <l n="234">Or heard the music of th ’ obedient bride :</l>
     <l n="235">If mild the evening , in the fields they stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="236">And their own flock with partial eye survey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="237">But oft the husband , to indulgence prone ,</l>
     <l n="238">Resumed his book , and bade them walk alone .</l>
     <l n="239">“ Do , my kind Edward — I must take mine ease -</l>
     <l n="240">Name the dear girl the planets and the trees :</l>
     <l n="241">Tell her what warblers pour their evening song ,</l>
     <l n="242">What insects flutter , as you walk along ;</l>
     <l n="243">Teach her to fix the roving thoughts , to bind</l>
     <l n="244">The wandering sense , and methodize the mind . ”</l>
     <l n="245">This was obey 'd ; and oft when this was done ,</l>
     <l n="246">They calmly gazed on the declining sun ;</l>
     <l n="247">In silence saw the glowing landscape fade ,</l>
     <l n="248">Or , sitting , sang beneath the arbour 's shade :</l>
     <l n="249">Till rose the moon , and on each youthful face</l>
     <l n="250">Shed a soft beauty and a dangerous grace .</l>
     <l n="251">When the young Wife beheld in long debate</l>
     <l n="252">Tho friends , all careless as she seeming sate ,</l>
     <l n="253">It soon appear 'd there was in one combined</l>
     <l n="254">The nobler person and the richer mind :</l>
     <l n="255">He wore no wig , no grisly beard was seen ,</l>
     <l n="256">And none beheld him careless or unclean ,</l>
     <l n="257">Or watch 'd him sleeping . We indeed have heard</l>
     <l n="258">Of sleeping beauty , and it has appear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="259">‘ Tis seen in infants — there indeed we find</l>
     <l n="260">The features soften 'd by the slumbering mind ;</l>
     <l n="261">But other beauties , when disposed to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="262">Should from the eye of keen inspector keep :</l>
     <l n="263">The lovely nymph who would her swain surprise ,</l>
     <l n="264">May close her mouth , but not conceal her eyes ;</l>
     <l n="265">Sleep from the fairest face some beauty takes ,</l>
     <l n="266">And all the homely features homelier makes :</l>
     <l n="267">So thought our wife , beholding with a sigh</l>
     <l n="268">Her sleeping spouse , and Edward smiling by .</l>
     <l n="269">A sick relation for the husband sent ;</l>
     <l n="270">Without delay the friendly sceptic went ;</l>
     <l n="271">Nor fear 'd the youthful pair , for he had seen</l>
     <l n="272">The wife untroubled , and the friend serene ;</l>
     <l n="273">No selfish purpose in his roving eyes ,</l>
     <l n="274">No vile deception in her fond replies :</l>
     <l n="275">So judged the husband , and with judgment true ,</l>
     <l n="276">For neither yet the guilt or danger knew .</l>
     <l n="277">What now remain 'd ? but they again should play</l>
     <l n="278">Th ’ accustom 'd game , and walk th ’ accustom 'd way ;</l>
     <l n="279">With careless freedom should converse or read ,</l>
     <l n="280">And the Friend 's absence neither fear nor heed :</l>
     <l n="281">But rather now they seem 'd confused , constrain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="282">Within their room still restless they remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="283">And painfully they felt , and knew each other pain 'd .</l>
     <l n="284">Ah , foolish men ! how could ye thus depend ,</l>
     <l n="285">One on himself , the other on his friend ?</l>
     <l n="286">The Youth with troubled eye the lady saw ,</l>
     <l n="287">Yet felt too brave , too daring to withdraw ;</l>
     <l n="288">While she , with tuneless hand the jarring keys</l>
     <l n="289">Touching , was not one moment at her ease :</l>
     <l n="290">Now would she walk , and call her friendly guide ,</l>
     <l n="291">Now speak of rain , and cast her cloak aside ;</l>
     <l n="292">Seize on a book , unconscious what she read ,</l>
     <l n="293">And restless still to new resources fled ;</l>
     <l n="294">Then laugh 'd aloud , then tried to look serene ;</l>
     <l n="295">And ever changed , and every change was seen .</l>
     <l n="296">Painful it is to dwell on deeds of shame -</l>
     <l n="297">The trying day was past , another came ;</l>
     <l n="298">The third was all remorse , confusion , dread ,</l>
     <l n="299">And ( all too late ! ) the fallen hero fled .</l>
     <l n="300">Then felt the Youth , in that seducing time ,</l>
     <l n="301">How feebly Honour guards the heart from crime :</l>
     <l n="302">Small is his native strength ; man needs the stay ,</l>
     <l n="303">The strength imparted in the trying day ;</l>
     <l n="304">For all that Honour brings against the force</l>
     <l n="305">Of headlong passion , aids its rapid course ;</l>
     <l n="306">Its slight resistance but provokes the fire ,</l>
     <l n="307">As wood-work stops the flame , and then conveys it higher .</l>
     <l n="308">The Husband came ; a wife by guilt made bold</l>
     <l n="309">Had , meeting , soothed him , as in days of old ;</l>
     <l n="310">But soon this fact transpired ; her strong distress ,</l>
     <l n="311">And his Friend 's absence , left him nought to guess .</l>
     <l n="312">Still cool , though grieved , thus prudence bade him write -</l>
     <l n="313">“ I cannot pardon , and I will not fight ;</l>
     <l n="314">Thou art too poor a culprit for the laws ,</l>
     <l n="315">And I too faulty to support my cause :</l>
     <l n="316">All must be punish 'd ; I must sigh alone ,</l>
     <l n="317">At home thy victim for her guilt atone ;</l>
     <l n="318">And thou , unhappy ! virtuous now no more ,</l>
     <l n="319">Must loss of fame , peace , purity deplore ;</l>
     <l n="320">Sinners with praise will pierce thee to the heart ,</l>
     <l n="321">And saints , deriding , tell thee what thou art . ”</l>
     <l n="322">Such was his fall ; and Edward , from that time ,</l>
     <l n="323">Felt in full force the censure and the crime -</l>
     <l n="324">Despised , ashamed ; his noble views before ,</l>
     <l n="325">And his proud thoughts , degraded him the more :</l>
     <l n="326">Should he repent — would that conceal his shame ?</l>
     <l n="327">Could peace be his ? It perish 'd with his fame :</l>
     <l n="328">Himself he scorn 'd , nor could his crime forgive ;</l>
     <l n="329">He fear 'd to die , yet felt ashamed to live :</l>
     <l n="330">Grieved , but not contrite , was his heart ; oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="331">Not broken ; not converted , but distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="332">He wanted will to bend the stubborn knee ,</l>
     <l n="333">He wanted light the cause of ill to see ,</l>
     <l n="334">To learn how frail is man , how humble then should be ;</l>
     <l n="335">For faith he had not , or a faith too weak</l>
     <l n="336">To gain the help that humble sinners seek ;</l>
     <l n="337">Else had he pray 'd — to an offended God</l>
     <l n="338">His tears had flown a penitential flood ;</l>
     <l n="339">Though far astray , he would have heard the call</l>
     <l n="340">Of mercy — “ Come ! return , thou prodigal : ”</l>
     <l n="341">Then , though confused , distress 'd , ashamed , afraid ,</l>
     <l n="342">Still had the trembling penitent obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="343">Though faith had fainted , when assail 'd by fear ,</l>
     <l n="344">Hope to the soul had whisper 'd , “ Persevere ! ”</l>
     <l n="345">Till in his Father 's house , an humbled guest ,</l>
     <l n="346">He would have found forgiveness , comfort , rest .</l>
     <l n="347">But all this joy was to our Youth denied</l>
     <l n="348">By his fierce passions and his daring pride ;</l>
     <l n="349">And shame and doubt impell 'd him in a course ,</l>
     <l n="350">Once so abhorr 'd , with unresisted force ,</l>
     <l n="351">Proud minds and guilty , whom their crimes oppress ,</l>
     <l n="352">Fly to new crimes for comfort and redress ;</l>
     <l n="353">So found our fallen Youth a short relief</l>
     <l n="354">In wine , the opiate guilt applies to grief , -</l>
     <l n="355">From fleeting mirth that o'er the bottle lives ,</l>
     <l n="356">From the false joy its inspiration gives , -</l>
     <l n="357">And from associates pleased to find a friend</l>
     <l n="358">With powers to lead them , gladden , and defend ,</l>
     <l n="359">In all those scenes where transient ease is found ,</l>
     <l n="360">For minds whom sins oppress and sorrows wound .</l>
     <l n="361">Wine is like anger ; for it makes us strong ,</l>
     <l n="362">Blind , and impatient , and it leads us wrong ;</l>
     <l n="363">The strength is quickly lost , we feel the error long :</l>
     <l n="364">Thus led , thus strengthen 'd , in an evil cause ,</l>
     <l n="365">For folly pleading , sought the Youth applause ;</l>
     <l n="366">Sad for a time , then eloquently wild ,</l>
     <l n="367">He gaily spoke as his companions smiled ;</l>
     <l n="368">Lightly he rose , and with his former grace</l>
     <l n="369">Proposed some doubt , and argued on the case ;</l>
     <l n="370">Fate and foreknowledge were his favourite themes -</l>
     <l n="371">How vain man 's purpose , how absurd his schemes :</l>
     <l n="372">“ Whatever is , was ere our birth decreed ;</l>
     <l n="373">We think our actions from ourselves proceed ,</l>
     <l n="374">And idly we lament th ’ inevitable deed ;</l>
     <l n="375">It seems our own , but there 's a power above</l>
     <l n="376">Directs the motion , nay , that makes us move ;</l>
     <l n="377">Nor good nor evil can you beings name ,</l>
     <l n="378">Who are but rooks and castles in the game ;</l>
     <l n="379">Superior natures with their puppets play ,</l>
     <l n="380">Till , bagg 'd or buried , all are swept away . ”</l>
     <l n="381">Such were the notions of a mind to ill</l>
     <l n="382">Now prone , but ardent and determined still :</l>
     <l n="383">Of joy now eager , as before of fame ,</l>
     <l n="384">And screen 'd by folly when assail 'd by shame ,</l>
     <l n="385">Deeply he sank ; obey 'd each passion 's call ,</l>
     <l n="386">And used his reason to defend them all .</l>
     <l n="387">Shall I proceed , and step by step relate</l>
     <l n="388">The odious progress of a Sinner 's fate ?</l>
     <l n="389">No — let me rather hasten to the time</l>
     <l n="390">( Sure to arrive ! ) when misery waits on crime .</l>
     <l n="391">With Virtue , prudence fled ; what Shore possessed</l>
     <l n="392">Was sold , was spent , and he was now distressed :</l>
     <l n="393">And Want , unwelcome stranger , pale and wan ,</l>
     <l n="394">Met with her haggard looks the hurried man :</l>
     <l n="395">His pride felt keenly what he must expect</l>
     <l n="396">From useless pity and from cold neglect .</l>
     <l n="397">Struck by new terrors , from his friends he fled ,</l>
     <l n="398">And wept his woes upon a restless bed ;</l>
     <l n="399">Retiring late , at early hour to rise ,</l>
     <l n="400">With shrunken features , and with bloodshot eyes :</l>
     <l n="401">If sleep one moment closed the dismal view ,</l>
     <l n="402">Fancy her terrors built upon the true :</l>
     <l n="403">And night and day had their alternate woes ,</l>
     <l n="404">That baffled pleasure , and that mock 'd repose ;</l>
     <l n="405">Till to despair and anguish was consign 'd</l>
     <l n="406">The wreck and ruin of a noble mind .</l>
     <l n="407">Now seized for debt , and lodged within a jail ,</l>
     <l n="408">He tried his friendships , and he found them fail ;</l>
     <l n="409">Then fail 'd his spirits , and his thoughts were all</l>
     <l n="410">Fix 'd on his sins , his sufferings , and his fall :</l>
     <l n="411">His ruffled mind was pictured in his face ,</l>
     <l n="412">Once the fair seat of dignity and grace :</l>
     <l n="413">Great was the danger of a man so prone</l>
     <l n="414">To think of madness , and to think alone ;</l>
     <l n="415">Yet pride still lived , and struggled to sustain</l>
     <l n="416">The drooping spirit and the roving brain ;</l>
     <l n="417">But this too fail 'd : a Friend his freedom gave ,</l>
     <l n="418">And sent him help the threat'ning world to brave ;</l>
     <l n="419">Gave solid counsel what to seek or flee ,</l>
     <l n="420">But still would stranger to his person be :</l>
     <l n="421">In vain ! the truth determined to explore ,</l>
     <l n="422">He traced the Friend whom he had wrong 'd before .</l>
     <l n="423">This was too much ; both aided and advised</l>
     <l n="424">By one who shunn 'd him , pitied , and despised :</l>
     <l n="425">He bore it not ; ‘ twas a deciding stroke ,</l>
     <l n="426">And on his reason like a torrent broke :</l>
     <l n="427">In dreadful stillness he appear 'd a while ,</l>
     <l n="428">With vacant horror and a ghastly smile ;</l>
     <l n="429">Then rose at once into the frantic rage ,</l>
     <l n="430">That force controlled not , nor could love assuage .</l>
     <l n="431">Friends now appear 'd , but in the Man was seen</l>
     <l n="432">The angry Maniac , with vindictive mien ;</l>
     <l n="433">Too late their pity gave to care and skill</l>
     <l n="434">The hurried mind and ever-wandering will :</l>
     <l n="435">Unnoticed pass 'd all time , and not a ray</l>
     <l n="436">Of reason broke on his benighted way ;</l>
     <l n="437">But now he spurn 'd the straw in pure disdain ,</l>
     <l n="438">And now laugh 'd loudly at the clinking chain .</l>
     <l n="439">Then , as its wrath subsided by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="440">The mind sank slowly to infantine ease ,</l>
     <l n="441">To playful folly , and to causeless joy ,</l>
     <l n="442">Speech without aim , and without end , employ ;</l>
     <l n="443">He drew fantastic figures on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="444">And gave some wild relation of them all ;</l>
     <l n="445">With brutal shape he join 'd the human face ,</l>
     <l n="446">And idiot smiles approved the motley race .</l>
     <l n="447">Harmless at length th ’ unhappy man was found ,</l>
     <l n="448">The spirit settled , but the reason drown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="449">And all the dreadful tempest died away</l>
     <l n="450">To the dull stillness of the misty day .</l>
     <l n="451">And now his freedom he attain 'd — if free</l>
     <l n="452">The lost to reason , truth , and hope , can be ;</l>
     <l n="453">His friends , or wearied with the charge , or sure</l>
     <l n="454">The harmless wretch was now beyond a cure ,</l>
     <l n="455">Gave him to wander where he pleased , and find</l>
     <l n="456">His own resources for the eager mind :</l>
     <l n="457">The playful children of the place he meets ,</l>
     <l n="458">Playful with them he rambles through the streets ;</l>
     <l n="459">In all they need , his stronger arm he lends ,</l>
     <l n="460">And his lost mind to these approving friends .</l>
     <l n="461">That gentle Maid , whom once the Youth had loved ,</l>
     <l n="462">Is now with mild religious pity moved ;</l>
     <l n="463">Kindly she chides his boyish flights , while he</l>
     <l n="464">Will for a moment fix 'd and pensive be ;</l>
     <l n="465">And as she trembling speaks , his lively eyes</l>
     <l n="466">Explore her looks , he listens to her sighs ;</l>
     <l n="467">Charm 'd by her voice , th ’ harmonious sounds invade</l>
     <l n="468">His clouded mind , and for a time persuade :</l>
     <l n="469">Like a pleased infant , who has newly caught</l>
     <l n="470">From the maternal glance a gleam of thought ,</l>
     <l n="471">He stands enrapt , the half-known voice to hear ,</l>
     <l n="472">And starts , half conscious , at the falling tear .</l>
     <l n="473">Rarely from town , nor then unwatch 'd , he goes ,</l>
     <l n="474">In darker mood , as if to hide his woes ;</l>
     <l n="475">Returning soon , he with impatience seeks</l>
     <l n="476">His youthful friends , and shouts , and sings , and speaks ;</l>
     <l n="477">Speaks a wild speech with action all is wild -</l>
     <l n="478">The children 's leader , and himself a child ;</l>
     <l n="479">He spins their top , or , at their bidding , bends</l>
     <l n="480">His back , while o'er it leap his laughing friends ;</l>
     <l n="481">Simple and weak , he acts the boy once more ,</l>
     <l n="482">And heedless children call him Silly Shore .</l>

     <l n="21">‘ Squire Thomas flatter 'd long a wealthy Aunt ,</l>
     <l n="22">Who left him all that she could give or grant ;</l>
     <l n="23">Ten years he tried , with all his craft and skill ,</l>
     <l n="24">To fix the sovereign lady 's varying will ;</l>
     <l n="25">Ten years enduring at her board to sit ,</l>
     <l n="26">He meekly listen 'd to her tales and wit :</l>
     <l n="27">He took the meanest office man can take ,</l>
     <l n="28">And his aunt 's vices for her money 's sake :</l>
     <l n="29">By many a threat'ning hint she waked his fear ,</l>
     <l n="30">And he was pain 'd to see a rival near :</l>
     <l n="31">Yet all the taunts of her contemptuous pride</l>
     <l n="32">He bore , nor found his grov'ling spirit tried :</l>
     <l n="33">Nay , when she wish 'd his parents to traduce ,</l>
     <l n="34">Fawning he smiled , and justice call 'd th ’ abuse :</l>
     <l n="35">“ They taught you nothing : are you not at best , ”</l>
     <l n="36">Said the proud Dame , “ a trifler , and a jest ?</l>
     <l n="37">Confess you are a fool ! ” — he bow 'd and he confess 'd .</l>
     <l n="38">This vex 'd him much , but could not always last :</l>
     <l n="39">The dame is buried , and the trial past .</l>
     <l n="40">There was a female , who had courted long</l>
     <l n="41">Her cousin 's gifts , and deeply felt the wrong ;</l>
     <l n="42">By a vain boy forbidden to attend</l>
     <l n="43">The private councils of her wealthy friend ,</l>
     <l n="44">She vow 'd revenge , nor should that crafty boy</l>
     <l n="45">In triumph undisturb 'd his spoils enjoy :</l>
     <l n="46">He heard , he smiled , and when the Will was read ,</l>
     <l n="47">Kindly dismiss 'd the Kindred of the dead ;</l>
     <l n="48">“ The dear deceased ” he call 'd her , and the crowd</l>
     <l n="49">Moved off with curses deep and threat'nings loud .</l>
     <l n="50">The youth retired , and , with a mind at ease ,</l>
     <l n="51">Found he was rich , and fancied he must please :</l>
     <l n="52">He might have pleased , and to his comfort found</l>
     <l n="53">The wife he wish 'd , if he had sought around ,</l>
     <l n="54">For there were lasses of his own degree ,</l>
     <l n="55">With no more hatred to the state than he ;</l>
     <l n="56">But he had courted spleen and age so long ,</l>
     <l n="57">His heart refused to woo the fair and young ;</l>
     <l n="58">So long attended on caprice and whim ,</l>
     <l n="59">He thought attention now was due to him ;</l>
     <l n="60">And as his flattery pleased the wealthy Dame ,</l>
     <l n="61">Heir to the wealth , he might the flattery claim :</l>
     <l n="62">But this the fair , with one accord , denied ,</l>
     <l n="63">Nor waived for man 's caprice the sex 's pride .</l>
     <l n="64">There is a season when to them is due</l>
     <l n="65">Worship and awe , and they will claim it too :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Fathers , ” they cry , “ long hold us in their chain ,</l>
     <l n="67">Nay , tyrant brothers claim a right to reign :</l>
     <l n="68">Uncles and guardians we in turn obey ,</l>
     <l n="69">And husbands rule with ever-during sway ;</l>
     <l n="70">Short is the time when lovers at the feet</l>
     <l n="71">Of beauty kneel , and own the slavery sweet ;</l>
     <l n="72">And shall we thus our triumph , this the aim</l>
     <l n="73">And boast of female power , forbear to claim ?</l>
     <l n="74">No ! we demand that homage , that respect ,</l>
     <l n="75">Or the proud rebel punish and reject . ”</l>
     <l n="76">Our Hero , still too indolent , too nice ,</l>
     <l n="77">To pay for beauty the accustom 'd price ,</l>
     <l n="78">No less forbore t'address the humbler maid ,</l>
     <l n="79">Who might have yielded with the price unpaid ;</l>
     <l n="80">But lived , himself to humour and to please ,</l>
     <l n="81">To count his money , and enjoy his ease .</l>
     <l n="82">It pleased a neighbouring ‘ squire to recommend</l>
     <l n="83">A faithful youth as servant to his friend ;</l>
     <l n="84">Nay , more than servant , whom he praised for parts</l>
     <l n="85">Ductile yet strong , and for the best of hearts :</l>
     <l n="86">One who might ease him in his small affairs ,</l>
     <l n="87">With tenants , tradesmen , taxes , and repairs ;</l>
     <l n="88">Answer his letters , look to all his dues ,</l>
     <l n="89">And entertain him with discourse and news .</l>
     <l n="90">The ‘ Squire believed , and found the trusted youth</l>
     <l n="91">A very pattern for his care and truth ;</l>
     <l n="92">Not for his virtues to be praised alone ,</l>
     <l n="93">But for a modest mien and humble tone ;</l>
     <l n="94">Assenting always , but as if he meant</l>
     <l n="95">Only to strength of reasons to assent :</l>
     <l n="96">For was he stubborn , and retain 'd his doubt ,</l>
     <l n="97">Till the more subtle ‘ Squire had forced it out ;</l>
     <l n="98">Nay , still was right , but he perceived that strong</l>
     <l n="99">And powerful minds could make the right the wrong .</l>
     <l n="100">When the ‘ Squire 's thoughts on some fair damsel dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="101">The faithful Friend his apprehensions felt ;</l>
     <l n="102">It would rejoice his faithful heart to find</l>
     <l n="103">A lady suited to his master 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="104">But who deserved that master ? who would prove</l>
     <l n="105">That hers was pure , uninterested love ?</l>
     <l n="106">Although a servant , he would scorn to take</l>
     <l n="107">A countess , till she suffer 'd for his sake ;</l>
     <l n="108">Some tender spirit , humble , faithful , true ,</l>
     <l n="109">Such , my dear master ! must be sought for you .</l>
     <l n="110">Six months had pass 'd , and not a lady seen ,</l>
     <l n="111">With just this love , ‘ twixt fifty and fifteen ;</l>
     <l n="112">All seem 'd his doctrine or his pride to shun ,</l>
     <l n="113">All would be woo 'd before they would be won ;</l>
     <l n="114">When the chance naming of a race and fair</l>
     <l n="115">Our ‘ Squire disposed to take his pleasure there ,</l>
     <l n="116">The Friend profess 'd , “ although he first began</l>
     <l n="117">To hint the thing , it seem 'd a thoughtless plan ;</l>
     <l n="118">The roads , he fear 'd , were foul , the days were short ,</l>
     <l n="119">The village far , and yet there might be sport . ”</l>
     <l n="120">“ What ! you of roads and starless nights afraid ?</l>
     <l n="121">You think to govern ! you to be obey 'd ! ”</l>
     <l n="122">Smiling he spoke : the humble Friend declared</l>
     <l n="123">His soul 's obedience , and to go prepared .</l>
     <l n="124">The place was distant , but with great delight</l>
     <l n="125">They saw a race , and hail 'd the glorious sight :</l>
     <l n="126">The ‘ Squire exulted , and declared the ride</l>
     <l n="127">Had amply paid , and he was satisfied .</l>
     <l n="128">They gazed , they feasted , and , in happy mood ,</l>
     <l n="129">Homeward return 'd , and hastening as they rode ;</l>
     <l n="130">For short the day , and sudden was the change</l>
     <l n="131">From light to darkness , and the way was strange :</l>
     <l n="132">Our hero soon grew peevish , then distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="133">He dreaded darkness , and he sigh 'd for rest :</l>
     <l n="134">Going , they pass 'd a village ; but alas !</l>
     <l n="135">Returning saw no village to repass ;</l>
     <l n="136">The ‘ Squire remember 'd too a noble hall ,</l>
     <l n="137">Large as a church , and whiter than its wall :</l>
     <l n="138">This he had noticed as they rode along ,</l>
     <l n="139">And justly reason 'd that their road was wrong ,</l>
     <l n="140">George , full of awe , was modest in reply -</l>
     <l n="141">“ The fault was his , ‘ twas folly to deny ;</l>
     <l n="142">And of his master 's safety were he sure ,</l>
     <l n="143">There was no grievance he would not endure . ”</l>
     <l n="144">This made his peace with the relenting ‘ Squire ,</l>
     <l n="145">Whose thoughts yet dwelt on supper and a fire ;</l>
     <l n="146">When , as they reach 'd a long and pleasant green ,</l>
     <l n="147">Dwellings of men , and next a man , were seen .</l>
     <l n="148">“ My friend , ” said George , “ to travellers astray</l>
     <l n="149">Point out an inn , and guide us on the way . ”</l>
     <l n="150">The man look 'd up ; “ Surprising ! can it be</l>
     <l n="151">My master 's son ? as I 'm alive , ‘ tis he ! ”</l>
     <l n="152">“ How ! Robin ? ” George replied , “ and are we near</l>
     <l n="153">My father 's house ? how strangely things appear ! -</l>
     <l n="154">Dear sir , though wanderers , we at last are right :</l>
     <l n="155">Let us proceed , and glad my father 's sight :</l>
     <l n="156">We shall at least be fairly lodged and fed ,</l>
     <l n="157">I can ensure a supper and a bed ;</l>
     <l n="158">Let us this night as one of pleasure date ,</l>
     <l n="159">And of surprise : it is an act of Fate . ”</l>
     <l n="160">“ Go on , ” the ‘ Squire in happy temper cried ;</l>
     <l n="161">“ I like such blunder ! I approve such guide . ”</l>
     <l n="162">They ride , they halt , the farmer comes in haste ,</l>
     <l n="163">Then tells his wife how much their house is graced ;</l>
     <l n="164">They bless the chance , they praise the lucky son .</l>
     <l n="165">That caused the error — Nay ! it was not one ,</l>
     <l n="166">But their good fortune : cheerful grew the ‘ Squire ,</l>
     <l n="167">Who found dependants , flattery , wine , and fire ;</l>
     <l n="168">He heard the jack turn round ; the busy dame</l>
     <l n="169">Produced her damask ; and with supper came</l>
     <l n="170">The Daughter , dress 'd with care , and full of maiden shame .</l>
     <l n="171">Surprised , our hero saw the air and dress ,</l>
     <l n="172">And strove his admiration to express ;</l>
     <l n="173">Nay ! felt it too — for Harriot was in truth</l>
     <l n="174">A tall fair beauty in the bloom of youth ;</l>
     <l n="175">And from the pleasure and surprise , a grace</l>
     <l n="176">Adorn 'd the blooming damsel 's form and face ;</l>
     <l n="177">Then , too , such high respect and duty paid</l>
     <l n="178">By all — such silent reverence in the maid ;</l>
     <l n="179">Vent'ring with caution , yet with haste , a glance ,</l>
     <l n="180">Loth to retire , yet trembling to advance ,</l>
     <l n="181">Appear 'd the nymph , and in her gentle guest</l>
     <l n="182">Stirr 'd soft emotions till the hour of rest ;</l>
     <l n="183">Sweet was his sleep , and in the morn again</l>
     <l n="184">He felt a mixture of delight and pain :</l>
     <l n="185">“ How fair , how gentle , ” said the ‘ Squire , “ how meek ,</l>
     <l n="186">And yet how sprightly , when disposed to speak !</l>
     <l n="187">Nature has bless 'd her form , and heaven her mind ,</l>
     <l n="188">But in her favours Fortune is unkind ;</l>
     <l n="189">Poor is the maid — nay , poor she cannot prove</l>
     <l n="190">Who is enrich 'd with beauty , worth , and love . ”</l>
     <l n="191">The ‘ Squire arose , with no precise intent</l>
     <l n="192">To go or stay — uncertain what he meant :</l>
     <l n="193">He moved to part — they begg 'd him first to dine ;</l>
     <l n="194">And who could then escape from Love and Wine ?</l>
     <l n="195">As came the night , more charming grew the Fair ,</l>
     <l n="196">And seem 'd to watch him with a twofold care :</l>
     <l n="197">On the third morn , resolving not to stay ,</l>
     <l n="198">Though urged by Love , he bravely rode away .</l>
     <l n="199">Arrived at home , three pensive days he gave</l>
     <l n="200">To feelings fond and meditations grave ;</l>
     <l n="201">Lovely she was , and , if he did not err ,</l>
     <l n="202">As fond of him as his fond heart of her ;</l>
     <l n="203">Still he delay 'd , unable to decide ,</l>
     <l n="204">Which was the master-passion , Love or Pride :</l>
     <l n="205">He sometimes wonder 'd how his friend could make ,</l>
     <l n="206">And then exulted in , the night 's mistake ;</l>
     <l n="207">Had she but fortune , “ Doubtless then , ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="208">“ Some happier man had won the wealthy bride . ”</l>
     <l n="209">While thus he hung in balance , now inclined</l>
     <l n="210">To change his state , and then to change his mind ,</l>
     <l n="211">That careless George dropp 'd idly on the ground</l>
     <l n="212">A letter , which his crafty master found ;</l>
     <l n="213">The stupid youth confess 'd his fault , and pray 'd</l>
     <l n="214">The generous ‘ Squire to spare a gentle maid ,</l>
     <l n="215">Of whom her tender mother , full of fears ,</l>
     <l n="216">Had written much — “ she caught her oft in tears ,</l>
     <l n="217">For ever thinking on a youth above</l>
     <l n="218">Her humble fortune — still she own 'd not love ;</l>
     <l n="219">Nor can define , dear girl ! the cherish 'd pain ,</l>
     <l n="220">But would rejoice to see the cause again :</l>
     <l n="221">That neighbouring youth , whom she endured before ,</l>
     <l n="222">She now rejects , and will behold no more ;</l>
     <l n="223">Raised by her passion , she no longer stoops</l>
     <l n="224">To her own equals , but she pines and droops ,</l>
     <l n="225">Like to a lily on whose sweets the sun</l>
     <l n="226">Has withering gazed — she saw and was undone ;</l>
     <l n="227">His wealth allured her not — nor was she moved</l>
     <l n="228">By his superior state , himself she loved ;</l>
     <l n="229">So mild , so good , so gracious , so genteel , -</l>
     <l n="230">But spare your sister , and her love conceal ;</l>
     <l n="231">We must the fault forgive , since she the pain must feel . ”</l>
     <l n="232">“ Fault ! ” said the ‘ Squire , “ there 's coarseness in the mind</l>
     <l n="233">That thus conceives of feelings so refined ;</l>
     <l n="234">Here end my doubts , nor blame yourself , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="235">Fate made you careless — here my doubts have end . ”</l>
     <l n="236">The way is plain before us — there is now</l>
     <l n="237">The Lover 's visit first , and then the vow ,</l>
     <l n="238">Mutual and fond , the marriage-rite , the Bride</l>
     <l n="239">Brought to her home with all a husband 's pride :</l>
     <l n="240">The ‘ Squire receives the prize his merits won ,</l>
     <l n="241">And the glad parents leave the patron-son .</l>
     <l n="242">But in short time he saw , with much surprise ,</l>
     <l n="243">First gloom , then grief , and then resentment rise ,</l>
     <l n="244">From proud , commanding frowns , and anger-darting eyes :</l>
     <l n="245">“ Is there in Harriot 's humble mind this fire ,</l>
     <l n="246">This fierce impatience ? ” ask 'd the puzzled ‘ Squire :</l>
     <l n="247">“ Has marriage changed her ? or the mask she wore</l>
     <l n="248">Has she thrown by , and is herself once more ? ”</l>
     <l n="249">Hour after hour , when clouds on clouds appear ,</l>
     <l n="250">Dark and more dark , we know the tempest near ;</l>
     <l n="251">And thus the frowning brow , the restless form ,</l>
     <l n="252">And threat'ning glance , forerun domestic storm :</l>
     <l n="253">So read the Husband , and , with troubled mind ,</l>
     <l n="254">Reveal 'd his fears — “ My Love , I hope you find</l>
     <l n="255">All here is pleasant — but I must confess</l>
     <l n="256">You seem offended , or in some distress :</l>
     <l n="257">Explain the grief you feel , and leave me to redress . ”</l>
     <l n="258">“ Leave it to you ? ” replied the Nymph — “ indeed !</l>
     <l n="259">What to the cause from whence the ills proceed ?</l>
     <l n="260">Good Heaven ! to take me from a place where I</l>
     <l n="261">Had every comfort underneath the sky ;</l>
     <l n="262">And then immure me in a gloomy place ,</l>
     <l n="263">With the grim monsters of your ugly race ,</l>
     <l n="264">That from their canvas staring , make me dread</l>
     <l n="265">Through the dark chambers , where they hang , to tread .</l>
     <l n="266">No friend nor neighbour comes to give that joy</l>
     <l n="267">Which all things here must banish or destroy .</l>
     <l n="268">Where is the promised coach ? the pleasant ride ?</l>
     <l n="269">Oh ! what a fortune has a Farmer 's bride !</l>
     <l n="270">Your sordid pride has placed me just above</l>
     <l n="271">Your hired domestics — and what pays me ? Love !</l>
     <l n="272">A selfish fondness I endure each hour ,</l>
     <l n="273">And share unwitness 'd pomp , unenvied power .</l>
     <l n="274">I hear your folly , smile at your parade ,</l>
     <l n="275">And see your favourite dishes duly made ;</l>
     <l n="276">Then am I richly dress 'd for you t'admire ,</l>
     <l n="277">Such is my duty and my Lord 's desire :</l>
     <l n="278">Is this a life for youth , for health , for joy ?</l>
     <l n="279">Are these my duties — this my base employ ?</l>
     <l n="280">No ! to my father 's house will I repair ,</l>
     <l n="281">And make your idle wealth support me there .</l>
     <l n="282">Was it your wish to have an humble bride ,</l>
     <l n="283">For bondage thankful ? Curse upon your pride !</l>
     <l n="284">Was it a slave you wanted ? You shall see ,</l>
     <l n="285">That , if not happy , I at least am free :</l>
     <l n="286">Well , sir ! your answer . ” — Silent stood the ‘ Squire ,</l>
     <l n="287">As looks a miser at his house on fire ;</l>
     <l n="288">Where all he deems is vanish 'd in that flame ,</l>
     <l n="289">Swept from the earth his substance and his name ,</l>
     <l n="290">So , lost to every promised joy of life ,</l>
     <l n="291">Our ‘ Squire stood gaping at his angry wife ; -</l>
     <l n="292">His fate , his ruin , where he saw it vain</l>
     <l n="293">To hope for peace , pray , threaten , or complain ;</l>
     <l n="294">And thus , betwixt his wonder at the ill</l>
     <l n="295">And his despair , there stood he gaping still .</l>
     <l n="296">“ Your answer , sir !— Shall I depart a spot</l>
     <l n="297">I thus detest ? ” — “ Oh , miserable lot ! ”</l>
     <l n="298">Exclaim 'd the man . “ Go , serpent ! nor remain</l>
     <l n="299">To sharpen woe by insult and disdain ;</l>
     <l n="300">A nest of harpies was I doom 'd to meet ;</l>
     <l n="301">What plots , what combinations of deceit !</l>
     <l n="302">I see it now — all plann 'd , design 'd , contrived ;</l>
     <l n="303">Served by that villain — by this fury wived -</l>
     <l n="304">What fate is mine ! What wisdom , virtue truth ,</l>
     <l n="305">Can stand if demons set their traps for youth ?</l>
     <l n="306">He lose his way ? vile dog ! he cannot lose</l>
     <l n="307">The way a villain through his life pursues ;</l>
     <l n="308">And thou , deceiver ! thou afraid to move ,</l>
     <l n="309">And hiding close the serpent in the dove !</l>
     <l n="310">I saw — but , fated to endure disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="311">Unheeding saw — the fury in thy face ,</l>
     <l n="312">And call 'd it spirit . Oh : I might have found</l>
     <l n="313">Fraud and imposture all the kindred round !</l>
     <l n="314">A nest of vipers ” -</l>
     <l n="315">“ Sir , I 'll not admit</l>
     <l n="316">These wild effusions of your angry wit :</l>
     <l n="317">Have you that value , that we all should use</l>
     <l n="318">Such mighty arts for such important views ?</l>
     <l n="319">Are you such prize — and is my state so fair ,</l>
     <l n="320">That they should sell their souls to get me there ?</l>
     <l n="321">Think you that we alone our thoughts disguise ?</l>
     <l n="322">When , in pursuit of some contended prize ,</l>
     <l n="323">Mask we alone the heart , and soothe whom we despise ?</l>
     <l n="324">Speak you of craft and subtle schemes , who know</l>
     <l n="325">That all your wealth you to deception owe ;</l>
     <l n="326">Who play 'd for ten dull years a scoundrel part ,</l>
     <l n="327">To worm yourself into a Widow 's heart ?</l>
     <l n="328">Now , when you guarded , with superior skill ,</l>
     <l n="329">That lady 's closet , and preserved her Will ,</l>
     <l n="330">Blind in your craft , you saw not one of those</l>
     <l n="331">Opposed by you might you in turn oppose ,</l>
     <l n="332">Or watch your motions , and by art obtain</l>
     <l n="333">Share of that wealth you gave your peace to gain .</l>
     <l n="334">Did conscience never ” -</l>
     <l n="335">“ Cease , tormentor , cease -</l>
     <l n="336">Or reach me poison ;— let me rest in peace ! ”</l>
     <l n="337">“ Agreed — but hear me — let the truth appear . ”</l>
     <l n="338">“ Then state your purpose — I 'll be calm and hear . ”</l>
     <l n="339">“ Know then , this wealth , sole object of your care ,</l>
     <l n="340">I had some right , without your hand , to share ;</l>
     <l n="341">My mother 's claim was just — but soon she saw</l>
     <l n="342">Your power , compell 'd , insulted , to withdraw :</l>
     <l n="343">‘ Twas then my father , in his anger , swore</l>
     <l n="344">You should divide the fortune , or restore .</l>
     <l n="345">Long we debated — and you find me now</l>
     <l n="346">Heroic victim to a father 's vow ;</l>
     <l n="347">Like Jephtha 's daughter , but in different state ,</l>
     <l n="348">And both decreed to mourn our early fate :</l>
     <l n="349">Hence was my brother servant to your pride ,</l>
     <l n="350">Vengeance made him your slave , and me your bride .</l>
     <l n="351">Now all is known — a dreadful price I pay</l>
     <l n="352">For our revenge — but still we have our day :</l>
     <l n="353">All that you love you must with others share ,</l>
     <l n="354">Or all you dread from their resentment dare : -</l>
     <l n="355">Yet terms I offer — let contention cease ;</l>
     <l n="356">Divide the spoil , and let us part in peace . ”</l>
     <l n="357">Our hero trembling heard — he sat , he rose -</l>
     <l n="358">Nor could his motions nor his mind compose ;</l>
     <l n="359">He paced the room — and , stalking to her side ,</l>
     <l n="360">Gazed on the face of his undaunted bride ,</l>
     <l n="361">And nothing there but scorn and calm aversion spied .</l>
     <l n="362">He would have vengeance , yet he fear 'd the law ;</l>
     <l n="363">Her friends would threaten , and their power he saw ;</l>
     <l n="364">“ Then let her go : ” but , oh ! a mighty sum</l>
     <l n="365">Would that demand , since he had let her come ;</l>
     <l n="366">Nor from his sorrows could he find redress ,</l>
     <l n="367">Save that which led him to a like distress ;</l>
     <l n="368">And all his ease was in his wife to see</l>
     <l n="369">A wretch as anxious and distress 'd as he :</l>
     <l n="370">Her strongest wish , the fortune to divide ,</l>
     <l n="371">And part in peace , his avarice denied ;</l>
     <l n="372">And thus it happen 'd , as in all deceit ,</l>
     <l n="373">The cheater found the evil of the cheat ;</l>
     <l n="374">The Husband griev 'd — nor was the Wife at rest ;</l>
     <l n="375">Him she could vex , and he could her molest ;</l>
     <l n="376">She could his passion into frenzy raise ,</l>
     <l n="377">But , when the fire was kindled , fear 'd the blaze ;</l>
     <l n="378">As much they studied , so in time they found</l>
     <l n="379">The easiest way to give the deepest wound ;</l>
     <l n="380">But then , like fencers , they were equal still , -</l>
     <l n="381">Both lost in danger what they gain 'd in skill ;</l>
     <l n="382">Each heart a keener kind of rancour gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="383">And , paining more , was more severely pain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="384">And thus by both was equal vengeance dealt ,</l>
     <l n="385">And both the anguish they inflicted felt .</l>

     <l n="14">That raise the soul and soften human hearts ;</l>
     <l n="15">And boasts a parent , who deserves to shine</l>
     <l n="16">In higher class , and I could wish her mine ;</l>
     <l n="17">Nor wants he will his station to improve ,</l>
     <l n="18">A just ambition waked by faithful love ;</l>
     <l n="19">Still is he poor — and here my Father 's Friend</l>
     <l n="20">Deigns for his Daughter , as her own , to send :</l>
     <l n="21">A worthy lady , who it seems has known</l>
     <l n="22">A world of griefs and troubles of her own :</l>
     <l n="23">I was an infant when she came a guest</l>
     <l n="24">Beneath my father 's humble roof to rest ;</l>
     <l n="25">Her kindred all unfeeling , vast her woes ,</l>
     <l n="26">Such her complaint , and there she found repose ;</l>
     <l n="27">Enrich 'd by fortune , now she nobly lives ,</l>
     <l n="28">And nobly , from the bless 'd abundance , gives ;</l>
     <l n="29">The grief , the want , of human life she knows ,</l>
     <l n="30">And comfort there and here relief bestows :</l>
     <l n="31">But are they not dependants ?— Foolish pride !</l>
     <l n="32">Am I not honour 'd by such friend and guide ?</l>
     <l n="33">Have I a home ” ( here Jesse dropp 'd a tear ) ,</l>
     <l n="34">“ Or friend beside ? ” — A faithful friend was near .</l>
     <l n="35">Now Colin came , at length resolved to lay</l>
     <l n="36">His heart before her , and to urge her stay :</l>
     <l n="37">True , his own plough the gentle Colin drove ,</l>
     <l n="38">An humble farmer with aspiring love ;</l>
     <l n="39">Who , urged by passion , never dared till now ,</l>
     <l n="40">Thus urged by fears , his trembling hopes avow :</l>
     <l n="41">Her father 's glebe he managed ; every year</l>
     <l n="42">The grateful Vicar held the youth more dear ;</l>
     <l n="43">He saw indeed the prize in Colin 's view ,</l>
     <l n="44">And wish 'd his Jesse with a man so true :</l>
     <l n="45">Timid as true , he urged with anxious air</l>
     <l n="46">His tender hope , and made the trembling prayer ,</l>
     <l n="47">When Jesse saw , nor could with coldness see ,</l>
     <l n="48">Such fond respect , such tried sincerity ;</l>
     <l n="49">Grateful for favours to her father dealt ,</l>
     <l n="50">She more than grateful for his passion felt ;</l>
     <l n="51">Nor could she frown on one so good and kind ,</l>
     <l n="52">Yet fear 'd to smile , and was unfix 'd in mind ;</l>
     <l n="53">But prudence placed the Female Friend in view -</l>
     <l n="54">What might not one so rich and grateful do ?</l>
     <l n="55">So lately , too , the good old Vicar died ,</l>
     <l n="56">His faithful daughter must not cast aside</l>
     <l n="57">The signs of filial grief , and be a ready bride .</l>
     <l n="58">Thus , led by prudence , to the Lady 's seat</l>
     <l n="59">The Village-Beauty purposed to retreat ;</l>
     <l n="60">But , as in hard-fought fields the victor knows</l>
     <l n="61">What to the vanquish 'd he in honour owes ,</l>
     <l n="62">So , in this conquest over powerful love ,</l>
     <l n="63">Prudence resolved a generous foe to prove ,</l>
     <l n="64">And Jesse felt a mingled fear and pain</l>
     <l n="65">In her dismission of a faithful swain ,</l>
     <l n="66">Gave her kind thanks , and when she saw his woe ,</l>
     <l n="67">Kindly betray 'd that she was loth to go ;</l>
     <l n="68">“ But would she promise , if abroad she met</l>
     <l n="69">A frowning world , she would remember yet</l>
     <l n="70">Where dwelt a friend ? ” — “ That could she not forget . ”</l>
     <l n="71">And thus they parted ; but each faithful heart</l>
     <l n="72">Felt the compulsion , and refused to part .</l>
     <l n="73">Now , by the morning mail the timid Maid</l>
     <l n="74">Was to that kind and wealthy Dame conveyed ;</l>
     <l n="75">Whose invitation , when her father died ,</l>
     <l n="76">Jesse as comfort to her heart applied ;</l>
     <l n="77">She knew the days her generous Friend had seen -</l>
     <l n="78">As wife and widow , evil days had been ;</l>
     <l n="79">She married early , and for half her life</l>
     <l n="80">Was an insulted and forsaken wife ;</l>
     <l n="81">Widow 'd and poor , her angry father gave ,</l>
     <l n="82">Mix 'd with reproach , the pittance of a slave ;</l>
     <l n="83">Forgetful brothers pass 'd her , but she knew</l>
     <l n="84">Her humbler friends , and to their home withdrew :</l>
     <l n="85">The good old Vicar to her sire applied</l>
     <l n="86">For help , and help 'd her when her sire denied .</l>
     <l n="87">When in few years Death stalk 'd through bower and hall ,</l>
     <l n="88">Sires , sons , and sons of sons , were buried all ,</l>
     <l n="89">She then abounded , and had wealth to spare</l>
     <l n="90">For softening grief she once was doom 'd to share ;</l>
     <l n="91">Thus train 'd in misery 's school , and taught to feel ,</l>
     <l n="92">She would rejoice an orphan 's woes to heal : -</l>
     <l n="93">So Jesse thought , who look 'd within her breast ,</l>
     <l n="94">And thence conceived how bounteous minds are bless 'd .</l>
     <l n="95">From her vast mansion look 'd the Lady down</l>
     <l n="96">On humbler buildings of a busy town ;</l>
     <l n="97">Thence came her friends of either sex , and all</l>
     <l n="98">With whom she lived on terms reciprocal :</l>
     <l n="99">They pass 'd the hours with their accustom 'd ease ,</l>
     <l n="100">As guests inclined , but not compelled , to please ;</l>
     <l n="101">But there were others in the mansion found ,</l>
     <l n="102">For office chosen , and by duties bound ;</l>
     <l n="103">Three female rivals , each of power possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="104">Th ’ attendant Maid , poor Friend , and kindred Guest .</l>
     <l n="105">To these came Jesse , as a seaman thrown</l>
     <l n="106">By the rude storm upon a coast unknown :</l>
     <l n="107">The view was flattering , civil seem 'd the race ,</l>
     <l n="108">But all unknown the dangers of the place .</l>
     <l n="109">Few hours had pass 'd , when , from attendants freed</l>
     <l n="110">The Lady utter 'd , “ This is kind indeed ;</l>
     <l n="111">Believe me , love ! that I for one like you</l>
     <l n="112">Have daily pray 'd , a friend discreet and true ;</l>
     <l n="113">Oh ! wonder not that I on you depend ,</l>
     <l n="114">You are mine own hereditary friend :</l>
     <l n="115">Hearken , my Jesse , never can I trust</l>
     <l n="116">Beings ungrateful , selfish , and unjust ;</l>
     <l n="117">But you are present , and my load of care</l>
     <l n="118">Your love will serve to lighten and to share :</l>
     <l n="119">Come near me , Jesse — let not those below</l>
     <l n="120">Of my reliance on your friendship know ;</l>
     <l n="121">Look as they look , be in their freedoms free -</l>
     <l n="122">But all they say do you convey to me . ”</l>
     <l n="123">Here Jesse 's thoughts to Colin 's cottage flew ,</l>
     <l n="124">And with such speed she scarce their absence knew .</l>
     <l n="125">“ Jane loves her mistress , and should she depart ,</l>
     <l n="126">I lose her service , and she breaks her heart ;</l>
     <l n="127">My ways and wishes , looks and thoughts , she knows ,</l>
     <l n="128">And duteous care by close attention shows :</l>
     <l n="129">But is she faithful ? in temptation strong ,</l>
     <l n="130">Will she not wrong me ? ah ! I fear the wrong ;</l>
     <l n="131">Your father loved me ; now , in time of need ,</l>
     <l n="132">Watch for my good , and to his place succeed .</l>
     <l n="133">“ Blood does n't bind — that Girl , who every day</l>
     <l n="134">Eats of my bread , would wish my life away ;</l>
     <l n="135">I am her dear relation , and she thinks</l>
     <l n="136">To make her fortune , an ambitious minx !</l>
     <l n="137">She only courts me for the prospect 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="138">Because she knows I have a Will to make ;</l>
     <l n="139">Yes , love ! my Will delay 'd , I know not how -</l>
     <l n="140">But you are here , and I will make it now .</l>
     <l n="141">“ That idle creature , keep her in your view ,</l>
     <l n="142">See what she does , what she desires to do ;</l>
     <l n="143">On her young mind may artful villains prey ,</l>
     <l n="144">And to my plate and jewels find a way :</l>
     <l n="145">A pleasant humour has the girl ; her smile ,</l>
     <l n="146">And cheerful manner , tedious hours beguile :</l>
     <l n="147">But well observe her , ever near her be ,</l>
     <l n="148">Close in your thoughts , in your professions free .</l>
     <l n="149">“ Again , my Jesse , hear what I advise ,</l>
     <l n="150">And watch a woman ever in disguise ;</l>
     <l n="151">Issop , that widow , serious , subtle , sly -</l>
     <l n="152">But what of this ?— I must have company :</l>
     <l n="153">She markets for me , and although she makes</l>
     <l n="154">Profit , no doubt , of all she undertakes ,</l>
     <l n="155">Yet she is one I can to all produce ,</l>
     <l n="156">And all her talents are in daily use :</l>
     <l n="157">Deprived of her , I may another find</l>
     <l n="158">As sly and selfish , with a weaker mind :</l>
     <l n="159">But never trust her , she is full of art ,</l>
     <l n="160">And worms herself into the closest heart ;</l>
     <l n="161">Seem then , I pray you , careless in her sight ,</l>
     <l n="162">Nor let her know , my love , how we unite .</l>
     <l n="163">“ Do , my good Jesse , cast a view around ,</l>
     <l n="164">And let no wrong within my house be found ;</l>
     <l n="165">That Girl associates with — I know not who</l>
     <l n="166">Are her companions , nor what ill they do ;</l>
     <l n="167">‘ Tis then the Widow plans , ‘ tis then she tries</l>
     <l n="168">Her various arts and schemes for fresh supplies ;</l>
     <l n="169">‘ Tis then , if ever , Jane her duty quits ,</l>
     <l n="170">And , whom I know not , favours and admits :</l>
     <l n="171">Oh ! watch their movements all ; for me ‘ tis hard ,</l>
     <l n="172">Indeed is vain , but you may keep a guard ;</l>
     <l n="173">And I , when none your watchful glance deceive ,</l>
     <l n="174">May make my Will , and think what I shall leave . ”</l>
     <l n="175">Jesse , with fear , disgust , alarm , surprise ,</l>
     <l n="176">Heard of these duties for her ears and eyes ;</l>
     <l n="177">Heard by what service she must gain her bread ,</l>
     <l n="178">And went with scorn and sorrow to her bed .</l>
     <l n="179">Jane was a servant fitted for her place ,</l>
     <l n="180">Experienced , cunning , fraudful , selfish , base ;</l>
     <l n="181">Skill 'd in those mean humiliating arts</l>
     <l n="182">That make their way to proud and selfish hearts :</l>
     <l n="183">By instinct taught , she felt an awe , a fear ,</l>
     <l n="184">For Jesse 's upright , simple character ;</l>
     <l n="185">Whom with gross flattery she awhile assail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="186">And then beheld with hatred when it fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="187">Yet , trying still upon her mind for hold ,</l>
     <l n="188">She all the secrets of the mansion told ;</l>
     <l n="189">And , to invite an equal trust , she drew</l>
     <l n="190">Of every mind a bold and rapid view ;</l>
     <l n="191">But on the widow 'd Friend with deep disdain ,</l>
     <l n="192">And rancorous envy , dwelt the treacherous Jane :</l>
     <l n="193">In vain such arts ;— without deceit or pride ,</l>
     <l n="194">With a just taste and feeling for her guide ,</l>
     <l n="195">From all contagion Jesse kept apart ,</l>
     <l n="196">Free in her manners , guarded in her heart .</l>
     <l n="197">Jesse one morn was thoughtful , and her sigh</l>
     <l n="198">The Widow heard as she was passing by ;</l>
     <l n="199">And — “ Well ! ” she said , “ is that some distant swain ,</l>
     <l n="200">Or aught with us , that gives your bosom pain ?</l>
     <l n="201">Come , we are fellow-sufferers , slaves in thrall ,</l>
     <l n="202">And tasks and griefs are common to us all ;</l>
     <l n="203">Think not my frankness strange : they love to paint</l>
     <l n="204">Their state with freedom , who endure restraint ;</l>
     <l n="205">And there is something in that speaking eye</l>
     <l n="206">And sober mien that prove I may rely :</l>
     <l n="207">You came a stranger ; to my words attend ,</l>
     <l n="208">Accept my offer , and you find a friend ;</l>
     <l n="209">It is a labyrinth in which you stray ,</l>
     <l n="210">Come , hold my clue , and I will lead the way .</l>
     <l n="211">“ Good Heav'n ! that one so jealous , envious , base ,</l>
     <l n="212">Should be the mistress of so sweet a place ;</l>
     <l n="213">She , who so long herself was low and poor ,</l>
     <l n="214">Now broods suspicious on her useless store ;</l>
     <l n="215">She loves to see us abject , loves to deal</l>
     <l n="216">Her insult round , and then pretends to feel :</l>
     <l n="217">Prepare to cast all dignity aside ,</l>
     <l n="218">For know , your talents will be quickly tried ;</l>
     <l n="219">Nor think , from favours past a friend to gain , -</l>
     <l n="220">‘ Tis but by duties we our posts maintain :</l>
     <l n="221">I read her novels , gossip through the town ,</l>
     <l n="222">And daily go , for idle stories down ;</l>
     <l n="223">I cheapen all she buys , and bear the curse</l>
     <l n="224">Of honest tradesmen for my niggard purse ;</l>
     <l n="225">And , when for her this meanness I display ,</l>
     <l n="226">She cries , ‘ I heed not what I throw away ; ’</l>
     <l n="227">Of secret bargains I endure the shame ,</l>
     <l n="228">And stake my credit for our fish and game ;</l>
     <l n="229">Oft has she smiled to hear ‘ her generous soul</l>
     <l n="230">Would gladly give , but stoops to my control : ’</l>
     <l n="231">Nay ! I have heard her , when she chanced to come</l>
     <l n="232">Where I contended for a petty sum ,</l>
     <l n="233">Affirm ‘ twas painful to behold such care ,</l>
     <l n="234">‘ But Issop 's nature is to pinch and spare : ’</l>
     <l n="235">Thus all the meanness of the house is mine ,</l>
     <l n="236">And my reward — to scorn her , and to dine .</l>
     <l n="237">“ See next that giddy thing , with neither pride</l>
     <l n="238">To keep her safe , nor principle to guide :</l>
     <l n="239">Poor , idle , simple flirt ! as sure as fate</l>
     <l n="240">Her maiden-fame will have an early date :</l>
     <l n="241">Of her beware ; for all who live below</l>
     <l n="242">Have faults they wish not all the world to know ,</l>
     <l n="243">And she is fond of listening , full of doubt ,</l>
     <l n="244">And stoops to guilt to find an error out .</l>
     <l n="245">“ And now once more observe the artful Maid ,</l>
     <l n="246">A lying , prying , jilting , thievish jade ;</l>
     <l n="247">I think , my love , you would not condescend</l>
     <l n="248">To call a low , illiterate girl your friend :</l>
     <l n="249">But in our troubles we are apt , you know ,</l>
     <l n="250">To lean on all who some compassion show ;</l>
     <l n="251">And she has flexile features , acting eyes ,</l>
     <l n="252">And seems with every look to sympathise ;</l>
     <l n="253">No mirror can a mortal 's grief express</l>
     <l n="254">With more precision , or can feel it less ;</l>
     <l n="255">That proud , mean spirit , she by fawning courts</l>
     <l n="256">By vulgar flattery , and by vile reports ;</l>
     <l n="257">And by that proof she every instant gives</l>
     <l n="258">To one so mean , that yet a meaner lives .</l>
     <l n="259">“ Come , I have drawn the curtain , and you see</l>
     <l n="260">Your fellow-actors , all our company ;</l>

     <l n="262">And in my judgment and my love confide ,</l>
     <l n="263">I could some prospects open to your view ,</l>
     <l n="264">That ask attention — and , till then , adieu . ”</l>
     <l n="265">“ Farewell ! ” said Jesse , hastening to her room ,</l>
     <l n="266">Where all she saw within , without , was gloom :</l>
     <l n="267">Confused , perplex 'd , she pass 'd a dreary hour ,</l>
     <l n="268">Before her reason could exert its power ;</l>
     <l n="269">To her all seem 'd mysterious , all allied</l>
     <l n="270">To avarice , meanness , folly , craft , and pride ;</l>
     <l n="271">Wearied with thought , she breathed the garden 's air ,</l>
     <l n="272">Then came the laughing Lass , and join 'd her thore .</l>
     <l n="273">“ My sweetest friend has dwelt with us a week ,</l>
     <l n="274">And does she love us ? be sincere and speak ;</l>
     <l n="275">My Aunt you cannot — Lord ! how I should hate</l>
     <l n="276">To be like her , all misery and state ;</l>
     <l n="277">Proud , and yet envious , she disgusted sees</l>
     <l n="278">All who are happy , and who look at ease .</l>
     <l n="279">Let friendship bind us , I will quickly show</l>
     <l n="280">Some favourites near us you 'll be bless 'd to know ;</l>
     <l n="281">My aunt forbids it — but , can she expect ,</l>
     <l n="282">To soothe her spleen , we shall ourselves neglect ?</l>
     <l n="283">Jane and the Widow were to watch and stay</l>
     <l n="284">My free-born feet ; I watch 'd as well as they :</l>
     <l n="285">Lo ! what is this ?— this simple key explores</l>
     <l n="286">The dark recess that holds the Spinster 's stores :</l>
     <l n="287">And , led by her ill star , I chanced to see</l>
     <l n="288">Where Issop keeps her stock of ratafie ;</l>
     <l n="289">Used in the hours of anger and alarm ,</l>
     <l n="290">It makes her civil , and it keeps her warm :</l>
     <l n="291">Thus bless 'd with secrets both would choose to hide ,</l>
     <l n="292">Their fears now grant me what their scorn denied .</l>
     <l n="293">“ My freedom thus by their assent secured ,</l>
     <l n="294">Bad as it is , the place may be endured ;</l>
     <l n="295">And bad it is , but her estates , you know ,</l>
     <l n="296">And her beloved hoards , she must bestow ;</l>
     <l n="297">So we can slily our amusements take ,</l>
     <l n="298">And friends of demons , if they help us , make . ”</l>
     <l n="299">“ Strange creatures these , ” thought Jesse , half inclined</l>
     <l n="300">To smile at one malicious and yet kind ;</l>
     <l n="301">Frank and yet cunning , with a heart to love</l>
     <l n="302">And malice prompt — the serpent and the dove ;</l>
     <l n="303">Here could she dwell ? or could she yet depart ?</l>
     <l n="304">Could she be artful ? could she bear with art ? -</l>
     <l n="305">This splendid mansion gave the cottage grace ,</l>
     <l n="306">She thought a dungeon was a happier place ;</l>
     <l n="307">And Colin pleading , when he pleaded best ,</l>
     <l n="308">Wrought not such sudden change in Jesse 's breast .</l>
     <l n="309">The wondering maiden , who had only read</l>
     <l n="310">Of such vile beings , saw them now with dread ;</l>
     <l n="311">Safe in themselves — for nature has design 'd</l>
     <l n="312">The creature 's poison harmless to the kind ;</l>
     <l n="313">But all beside who in the haunts are found</l>
     <l n="314">Must dread the poison , and must feel the wound .</l>
     <l n="315">Days full of care , slow weary weeks pass 'd on ,</l>
     <l n="316">Eager to go , still Jesse was not gone ;</l>
     <l n="317">Her time in trifling , or in tears , she spent ,</l>
     <l n="318">She never gave , she never felt , content :</l>
     <l n="319">The Lady wonder 'd that her humble guest</l>
     <l n="320">Strove not to please , would neither lie nor jest ;</l>
     <l n="321">She sought no news , no scandal would convey ,</l>
     <l n="322">But walk 'd for health , and was at church to pray :</l>
     <l n="323">All this displeased , and soon the Widow cried ,</l>
     <l n="324">“ Let me be frank — I am not satisfied ;</l>
     <l n="325">You know my wishes , I your judgment trust ;</l>
     <l n="326">You can be useful , Jesse , and you must :</l>
     <l n="327">Let me be plainer , child — I want an ear ,</l>
     <l n="328">When I am deaf , instead of mine to hear ;</l>
     <l n="329">When mine is sleeping let your eye awake ;</l>
     <l n="330">When I observe not , observation take :</l>
     <l n="331">Alas ! I rest not on my pillow laid ,</l>
     <l n="332">Then threat'ning whispers make my soul afraid ;</l>
     <l n="333">The tread of strangers to my ear ascends ,</l>
     <l n="334">Fed at my cost , the minions of my friends ;</l>
     <l n="335">While you , without a care , a wish to please ,</l>
     <l n="336">Eat the vile bread of idleness and ease . ”</l>
     <l n="337">Th ’ indignant Girl , astonish 'd , answer 'd — “ Nay !</l>
     <l n="338">This instant , madam , let me haste away :</l>
     <l n="339">Thus speaks my father 's , thus an orphan 's friend ?</l>
     <l n="340">This instant , lady , let your bounty end . ”</l>
     <l n="341">The Lady frown 'd indignant — “ What ! ” she cried ,</l>
     <l n="342">“ A vicar 's daughter with a princess ’ pride</l>
     <l n="343">And pauper 's lot ! but pitying I forgive ;</l>
     <l n="344">How , simple Jesse , do you think to live ?</l>
     <l n="345">Have I not power to help you , foolish maid ?</l>
     <l n="346">To my concerns be your attention paid ;</l>
     <l n="347">With cheerful mind th ’ allotted duties take ,</l>
     <l n="348">And recollect I have a Will to make . ”</l>
     <l n="349">Jesse , who felt as liberal natures feel ,</l>
     <l n="350">When thus the baser their designs reveal ,</l>
     <l n="351">Replied — “ Those duties were to her unfit ,</l>
     <l n="352">Nor would her spirit to her tasks submit . ”</l>
     <l n="353">In silent scorn the Lady sat awhile ,</l>
     <l n="354">And then replied with stern contemptuous smile -</l>
     <l n="355">“ Think you , fair madam , that you came to share</l>
     <l n="356">Fortunes like mine without a thought or care ?</l>
     <l n="357">A guest , indeed ! from every trouble free ,</l>
     <l n="358">Dress 'd by my help , with not a care for me ;</l>
     <l n="359">When I a visit to your father made ,</l>
     <l n="360">I for the poor assistance largely paid ;</l>
     <l n="361">To his domestics I their tasks assign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="362">I fix 'd the portion for his hungry hind ;</l>
     <l n="363">And had your father ( simple man ! ) obey 'd</l>
     <l n="364">My good advice , and watch 'd as well as pray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="365">He might have left you something with his prayers ,</l>
     <l n="366">And lent some colour for these lofty airs . -</l>
     <l n="367">“ In tears , my love ! Oh , then my soften 'd heart</l>
     <l n="368">Cannot resist — we never more will part ;</l>
     <l n="369">I need your friendship — I will be your friend ,</l>
     <l n="370">And , thus determined , to my Will attend . ”</l>
     <l n="371">Jesse went forth , but with determined soul</l>
     <l n="372">To fly such love , to break from such control :</l>
     <l n="373">“ I hear enough , ” the trembling damsel cried ;</l>
     <l n="374">Flight be my care , and Providence my guide :</l>
     <l n="375">Ere yet a prisoner , I escape will make ;</l>
     <l n="376">Will , thus display 'd , th ’ insidious arts forsake ,</l>
     <l n="377">And , as the rattle sounds , will fly the fatal snake . ”</l>
     <l n="378">Jesse her thanks upon the morrow paid ,</l>
     <l n="379">Prepared to go , determined though afraid .</l>
     <l n="380">“ Ungrateful creature ! ” said the Lady , “ this</l>
     <l n="381">Could I imagine ?— are you frantic , miss ?</l>
     <l n="382">What ! leave your friend , your prospects — is it true ? ”</l>
     <l n="383">This Jesse answer 'd by a mild “ Adieu ? ”</l>
     <l n="384">The Dame replied “ Then houseless may you rove ,</l>
     <l n="385">The starving victim to a guilty love ;</l>
     <l n="386">Branded with shame , in sickness doom 'd to nurse</l>
     <l n="387">An ill-form 'd cub , your scandal and your curse ;</l>
     <l n="388">Spurn 'd by its scoundrel father , and ill fed</l>
     <l n="389">By surly rustics with the parish-bread ! -</l>
     <l n="390">Relent you not ?— speak — yet I can forgive ;</l>
     <l n="391">Still live with me . ” — “ With you , ” said Jesse , “ live ?</l>
     <l n="392">No ! I would first endure what you describe ,</l>
     <l n="393">Rather than breathe with your detested tribe ;</l>
     <l n="394">Who long have feign 'd , till now their very hearts</l>
     <l n="395">Are firmly fix 'd in their accursed parts ;</l>
     <l n="396">Who all profess esteem , and feel disdain ,</l>
     <l n="397">And all , with justice , of deceit complain ;</l>
     <l n="398">Whom I could pity , but that , while I stay ,</l>
     <l n="399">My terror drives all kinder thoughts away ;</l>
     <l n="400">Grateful for this , that , when I think of you ,</l>
     <l n="401">I little fear what poverty can do . ”</l>
     <l n="402">The angry matron her attendant Jane</l>
     <l n="403">Summon 'd in haste to soothe the fierce disdain : -</l>
     <l n="404">“ A vile detested wretch ! ” the Lady cried ,</l>
     <l n="405">“ Yet shall she be by many an effort tried ,</l>
     <l n="406">And , clogg 'd with debt and fear , against her will abide ;</l>
     <l n="407">And , once secured , she never shall depart</l>
     <l n="408">Till I have proved the firmness of her heart :</l>
     <l n="409">Then when she dares not , would not , cannot go</l>
     <l n="410">I 'll make her feel what ‘ tis to use me so . ”</l>
     <l n="411">The pensive Colin in his garden stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="412">But felt not then the beauties it display 'd ;</l>
     <l n="413">There many a pleasant object met his view ,</l>
     <l n="414">A rising wood of oaks behind it grew ;</l>
     <l n="415">A stream ran by it , and the village-green</l>
     <l n="416">And public road were from the garden seen ;</l>
     <l n="417">Save where the pine and larch the bound'ry made ,</l>
     <l n="418">And on the rose-beds threw a softening shade .</l>
     <l n="419">The Mother sat beside the garden-door ,</l>
     <l n="420">Dress 'd as in times ere she and hers were poor ;</l>
     <l n="421">The broad-laced cap was known in ancient days ,</l>
     <l n="422">When madam 's dress compell 'd the village praise ;</l>
     <l n="423">And still she look 'd as in the times of old ,</l>
     <l n="424">Ere his last farm the erring husband sold ;</l>
     <l n="425">While yet the mansion stood in decent state ,</l>
     <l n="426">And paupers waited at the well-known gate .</l>
     <l n="427">“ Alas , my son ! ” the Mother cried , “ and why</l>
     <l n="428">That silent grief and oft-repeated sigh ?</l>
     <l n="429">True we are poor , but thou hast never felt</l>
     <l n="430">Pangs to thy father for his error dealt ;</l>
     <l n="431">Pangs from strong hopes of visionary gain ,</l>
     <l n="432">For ever raised , and ever found in vain .</l>
     <l n="433">He rose unhappy from his fruitless schemes ,</l>
     <l n="434">As guilty wretches from their blissful dreams ;</l>
     <l n="435">But thou wert then , my son , a playful child ,</l>
     <l n="436">Wondering at grief , gay , innocent , and wild ;</l>
     <l n="437">Listening at times to thy poor mother 's sighs</l>
     <l n="438">With curious looks and innocent surprise ;</l>
     <l n="439">Thy father dying , thou my virtuous boy ,</l>
     <l n="440">My comfort always , waked my soul to joy ;</l>
     <l n="441">With the poor remnant of our fortune left ,</l>
     <l n="442">Thou hast our station of its gloom bereft :</l>
     <l n="443">Thy lively temper , and thy cheerful air ,</l>
     <l n="444">Have cast a smile on sadness and despair ;</l>
     <l n="445">Thy active hand has dealt to this poor space</l>
     <l n="446">The bliss of plenty and the charm of grace ;</l>
     <l n="447">And all around us wonder when they find</l>
     <l n="448">Such taste and strength , such skill and power combined ;</l>
     <l n="449">There is no mother , Colin , no not one ,</l>
     <l n="450">But envies me so kind , so good a son ;</l>
     <l n="451">By thee supported on this failing side ,</l>
     <l n="452">Weakness itself awakes a parent 's pride :</l>
     <l n="453">I bless the stroke that was my grief before ,</l>
     <l n="454">And feel such joy that ‘ tis disease no more ;</l>
     <l n="455">Shielded by thee , my want becomes my wealth ,</l>
     <l n="456">And , soothed by Colin , sickness smiles at health ;</l>
     <l n="457">The old men love thee , they repeat thy praise ,</l>
     <l n="458">And say , like thee were youth in earlier days ;</l>
     <l n="459">While every village-maiden cries , ‘ How gay ,</l>
     <l n="460">How smart , how brave , how good is Colin Grey ! ’</l>
     <l n="461">“ Yet art thou sad ; alas ! my son , I know</l>
     <l n="462">Thy heart is wounded , and the cure is slow ;</l>
     <l n="463">Fain would I think that Jesse still may come</l>
     <l n="464">To share the comforts of our rustic home :</l>
     <l n="465">She surely loved thee ; I have seen the maid ,</l>
     <l n="466">When thou hast kindly brought the Vicar aid -</l>
     <l n="467">When thou hast eased his bosom of its pain ,</l>
     <l n="468">Oh ! I have seen her — she will come again . ”</l>
     <l n="469">The Matron ceased ; and Colin stood the while</l>
     <l n="470">Silent , but striving for a grateful smile ;</l>
     <l n="471">He then replied — “ Ah ! sure , had Jesse stay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="472">And shared the comforts of our sylvan shade ,</l>
     <l n="473">The tenderest duty and the fondest love</l>
     <l n="474">Would not have fail 'd that generous heart to move ;</l>
     <l n="475">A grateful pity would have ruled her breast ,</l>
     <l n="476">And my distresses would have made me bless 'd .</l>
     <l n="477">“ But she is gone , and ever has in view</l>
     <l n="478">Grandeur and taste ,— and what will then ensue ?</l>
     <l n="479">Surprise and then delight in scenes so fair and new ;</l>
     <l n="480">For many a day , perhaps for many a week ,</l>
     <l n="481">Home will have charms , and to her bosom speak ;</l>
     <l n="482">But thoughtless ease , and affluence , and pride ,</l>
     <l n="483">Seen day by day , will draw the heart aside :</l>
     <l n="484">And she at length , though gentle and sincere ,</l>
     <l n="485">Will think no more of our enjoyments here . ”</l>
     <l n="486">Sighing he spake — but hark ! he hears th ’ approach</l>
     <l n="487">Of rattling wheels ! and , lo ! the evening coach ;</l>
     <l n="488">Once more the movement of the horses ’ feet</l>
     <l n="489">Makes the fond heart with strong emotion beat :</l>
     <l n="490">Faint were his hopes , but ever had the sight</l>
     <l n="491">Drawn him to gaze beside his gate at night ;</l>
     <l n="492">And when with rapid wheels it hurried by ,</l>
     <l n="493">He grieved his parent with a hopeless sigh ;</l>
     <l n="494">And could the blessing have been bought — what sum</l>
     <l n="495">Had he not offer 'd to have Jesse come !</l>
     <l n="496">She came — he saw her bending from the door ,</l>
     <l n="497">Her face , her smile , and he beheld no more ;</l>
     <l n="498">Lost in his joy — the mother lent her aid</l>
     <l n="499">T'assist and to detain the willing Maid ;</l>
     <l n="500">Who thought her late , her present home to make ,</l>
     <l n="501">Sure of a welcome for the Vicar 's sake :</l>
     <l n="502">But the good parent was so pleased , so kind ,</l>
     <l n="503">So pressing Colin , she so much inclined ,</l>
     <l n="504">That night advanced ; and then , so long detain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="505">No wishes to depart she felt , or feign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="506">Yet long in doubt she stood , and then perforce remain 'd .</l>
     <l n="507">Here was a lover fond , a friend sincere ;</l>
     <l n="508">Here was content and joy , for she was here :</l>
     <l n="509">In the mild evening , in the scene around ,</l>
     <l n="510">The Maid , now free , peculiar beauties found ;</l>
     <l n="511">Blended with village-tones , the evening gale</l>
     <l n="512">Gave the sweet night-bird 's warblings to the vale :</l>
     <l n="513">The Youth , embolden 'd , yet abash 'd , now told</l>
     <l n="514">His fondest wish , nor found the maiden cold ;</l>
     <l n="515">The Mother smiling whisper 'd , “ Let him go</l>
     <l n="516">And seek the licence ! ” Jesse answer 'd “ No : ”</l>
     <l n="517">But Colin went .— I know not if they live</l>
     <l n="518">With all the comforts wealth and plenty give ;</l>
     <l n="519">But with pure joy to envious souls denied ,</l>
     <l n="520">To suppliant meanness and suspicious pride ;</l>
     <l n="521">And village-maids of happy couples say ,</l>
     <l n="522">“ They live like Jesse Bourn and Colin Grey . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="14">A serious Toyman in the city dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="15">Who much concern for his religion felt ;</l>
     <l n="16">Reading , he changed his tenets , read again ,</l>
     <l n="17">And various questions could with skill maintain ;</l>
     <l n="18">Papist and Quaker if we set aside ,</l>
     <l n="19">He had the road of every traveller tried ;</l>
     <l n="20">There walk 'd a while , and on a sudden turn 'd</l>
     <l n="21">Into some by-way he had just discern 'd :</l>
     <l n="22">He had a nephew , Fulham : — Fulham went</l>
     <l n="23">His Uncle 's way , with every turn content ;</l>
     <l n="24">He saw his pious kinsman 's watchful care ,</l>
     <l n="25">And thought such anxious pains his own might spare ,</l>
     <l n="26">And he the truth obtain 'd , without the toil , might share .</l>
     <l n="27">In fact , young Fulham , though he little read ,</l>
     <l n="28">Perceived his uncle was by fancy led ;</l>
     <l n="29">And smiled to see the constant care he took ,</l>
     <l n="30">Collating creed with creed , and book with book .</l>
     <l n="31">At length the senior fix 'd ; I pass the sect</l>
     <l n="32">He call 'd a Church , ‘ twas precious and elect ;</l>
     <l n="33">Yet the seed fell not in the richest soil ,</l>
     <l n="34">For few disciples paid the preacher 's toil ;</l>
     <l n="35">All in an attic room were wont to meet ,</l>
     <l n="36">These few disciples , at their pastor 's feet ;</l>
     <l n="37">With these went Fulham , who , discreet and grave ,</l>
     <l n="38">Follow 'd the light his worthy uncle gave ;</l>
     <l n="39">Till a warm Preacher found the way t'impart</l>
     <l n="40">Awakening feelings to his torpid heart :</l>
     <l n="41">Some weighty truths , and of unpleasant kind ,</l>
     <l n="42">Sank , though resisted , in his struggling mind :</l>
     <l n="43">He wish 'd to fly them , but , compell 'd to stay ,</l>
     <l n="44">Truth to the waking Conscience found her way ;</l>
     <l n="45">For though the Youth was call 'd a prudent lad ,</l>
     <l n="46">And prudent was , yet serious faults he had -</l>
     <l n="47">Who now reflected — “ Much am I surprised ;</l>
     <l n="48">I find these notions cannot be despised :</l>
     <l n="49">No ! there is something I perceive at last ,</l>
     <l n="50">Although my uncle cannot hold it fast ;</l>
     <l n="51">Though I the strictness of these men reject ,</l>
     <l n="52">Yet I determine to be circumspect :</l>
     <l n="53">This man alarms me , and I must begin</l>
     <l n="54">To look more closely to the things within :</l>
     <l n="55">These sons of zeal have I derided long ,</l>
     <l n="56">But now begin to think the laugher 's wrong !</l>
     <l n="57">Nay , my good uncle , by all teachers moved ,</l>
     <l n="58">Will be preferr 'd to him who none approved ; -</l>
     <l n="59">Better to love amiss than nothing to have loved . ”</l>
     <l n="60">Such were his thoughts , when Conscience first began</l>
     <l n="61">To hold close converse with th ’ awaken 'd man :</l>
     <l n="62">He from that time reserved and cautious grew ,</l>
     <l n="63">And for his duties felt obedience due ;</l>
     <l n="64">Pious he was not , but he fear 'd the pain</l>
     <l n="65">Of sins committed , nor would sin again :</l>
     <l n="66">Whene'er he stray 'd , he found his Conscience rose ,</l>
     <l n="67">Like one determined what was ill t'oppose ,</l>
     <l n="68">What wrong t'accuse , what secret to disclose ;</l>
     <l n="69">To drag forth every latent act to light ,</l>
     <l n="70">And fix them fully in the actor 's sight :</l>
     <l n="71">This gave him trouble , but he still confess 'd</l>
     <l n="72">The labour useful , for it brought him rest .</l>
     <l n="73">The Uncle died , and when the Nephew read</l>
     <l n="74">The will , and saw the substance of the dead -</l>
     <l n="75">Five hundred guineas , with a stock in trade -</l>
     <l n="76">He much rejoiced , and thought his fortune made ;</l>
     <l n="77">Yet felt aspiring pleasure at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="78">And for increase , increasing appetite ;</l>
     <l n="79">Desire of profit idle habits check 'd</l>
     <l n="80">( For Fulham 's virtue was to be correct ) ;</l>
     <l n="81">He and his Conscience had their compact made -</l>
     <l n="82">“ Urge me with truth , and you will soon persuade ;</l>
     <l n="83">But not , ” he cried , “ for mere ideal things</l>
     <l n="84">Give me to feel those terror-breeding stings . ”</l>
     <l n="85">“ Let not such thoughts , ” she said , “ your mind confound ;</l>
     <l n="86">Trifles may wake me , but they never wound ;</l>
     <l n="87">In them indeed there is a wrong and right ,</l>
     <l n="88">But you will find me pliant and polite ;</l>
     <l n="89">Not like a Conscience of the dotard kind ,</l>
     <l n="90">Awake to dreams , to dire offences blind :</l>
     <l n="91">Let all within be pure , in all beside</l>
     <l n="92">Be your own master , governor , and guide ;</l>
     <l n="93">Alive to danger , in temptation strong ,</l>
     <l n="94">And I shall sleep our whole existence long . ”</l>
     <l n="95">“ Sweet be thy sleep , ” said Fulham ; “ strong must be</l>
     <l n="96">The tempting ill that gains access to me :</l>
     <l n="97">Never will I to evil deed consent ;</l>
     <l n="98">Or , if surprised , oh ! how will I repent !</l>
     <l n="99">Should gain be doubtful , soon would I restore</l>
     <l n="100">The dangerous good , or give it to the poor ;</l>
     <l n="101">Repose for them my growing wealth shall buy ,</l>
     <l n="102">Or build — who knows ?— an hospital like Guy .</l>
     <l n="103">Yet why such means to soothe the smart within ,</l>
     <l n="104">While firmly purposed to renounce the sin ? ”</l>
     <l n="105">Thus our young Trader and his Conscience dwelt</l>
     <l n="106">In mutual love , and great the joy they felt ;</l>
     <l n="107">But yet in small concerns , in trivial things ,</l>
     <l n="108">“ She was , ” he said , “ too ready with the stings ; ”</l>
     <l n="109">And he too apt , in search of growing gains ,</l>
     <l n="110">To lose the fear of penalties and pains :</l>
     <l n="111">Yet these were trifling bickerings , petty jars ,</l>
     <l n="112">Domestic strifes , preliminary wars ;</l>
     <l n="113">He ventured little , little she express 'd</l>
     <l n="114">Of indignation , and they both had rest .</l>
     <l n="115">Thus was he fix d to walk the worthy way ,</l>
     <l n="116">When profit urged him to a bold essay : -</l>
     <l n="117">A time was that when all at pleasure gamed</l>
     <l n="118">In lottery chances , yet a law unblamed :</l>
     <l n="119">This Fulham tried ; who would to him advance</l>
     <l n="120">A pound or crown , he gave in turn a chance</l>
     <l n="121">For weighty prize — and should they nothing share ,</l>
     <l n="122">They had their crown or pound in Fulham 's ware ;</l>
     <l n="123">Thus the old stores within the shop were sold</l>
     <l n="124">For that which none refuses , new or old .</l>
     <l n="125">Was this unjust ? yet Conscience could not rest ,</l>
     <l n="126">But made a mighty struggle in the breast ,</l>
     <l n="127">And gave th ’ aspiring man an early proof</l>
     <l n="128">That should they war he would have work enough :</l>
     <l n="129">“ Suppose , ” said she , “ your vended numbers rise</l>
     <l n="130">The same with those which gain each real prize ,</l>
     <l n="131">( Such your proposal ) , can you ruin shun ? ” -</l>
     <l n="132">“ A hundred thousand , ” he replied , “ to one . ”</l>
     <l n="133">“ Still it may happen . ” — “ I the sum must pay . ”</l>
     <l n="134">“ You know you cannot . ” — “ I can run away . ”</l>
     <l n="135">“ That is dishonest . ” — “ Nay , but you must wink</l>
     <l n="136">At a chance hit : it cannot be , I think .</l>
     <l n="137">Upon my conduct as a whole decide ,</l>
     <l n="138">Such trifling errors let my virtues hide .</l>
     <l n="139">Fail I at meeting ? am I sleepy there ?</l>
     <l n="140">My purse refuse I with the priest to share ?</l>
     <l n="141">Do I deny the poor a helping hand ?</l>
     <l n="142">Or stop the wicked women in the Strand ?</l>
     <l n="143">Or drink at club beyond a certain pitch ?</l>
     <l n="144">Which are your charges ? Conscience , tell me which ? ”</l>
     <l n="145">“ ‘ Tis well , ” said she , “ but — ” “ Nay , I pray , have done :</l>
     <l n="146">Trust me , I will not into danger run . ”</l>
     <l n="147">The lottery drawn , not one demand was made ;</l>
     <l n="148">Fulham gain 'd profit and increase of trade .</l>
     <l n="149">“ See now , ” said he — for Conscience yet arose -</l>
     <l n="150">“ How foolish ‘ tis such measures to oppose :</l>
     <l n="151">Have I not blameless thus my state advanced ? ”</l>
     <l n="152">“ Still , ” mutter 'd Conscience , “ still it might have chanced . ”</l>
     <l n="153">“ Might ! ” said our hero : “ who is so exact</l>
     <l n="154">As to inquire what might have been a fact ? ”</l>
     <l n="155">Now Fulham 's shop contain 'd a curious view</l>
     <l n="156">Of costly trifles , elegant and new :</l>
     <l n="157">The papers told where kind mammas might buy</l>
     <l n="158">The gayest toys to charm an infant 's eye ;</l>
     <l n="159">Where generous beaux might gentle damsels please ,</l>
     <l n="160">And travellers call who cross the land or seas ,</l>
     <l n="161">And find the curious art , the neat device ,</l>
     <l n="162">Of precious value and of trifling price .</l>
     <l n="163">Here Conscience rested , she was pleased to find</l>
     <l n="164">No less an active than an honest mind ;</l>
     <l n="165">But when he named his price , and when he swore</l>
     <l n="166">His Conscience check 'd him that he ask 'd no more ,</l>
     <l n="167">When half he sought had been a large increase</l>
     <l n="168">On fair demand , she could not rest in peace ;</l>
     <l n="169">( Beside th ’ affront to call th ’ adviser in ,</l>
     <l n="170">Who would prevent , to justify the sin ):</l>
     <l n="171">She therefore told him that “ he vainly tried</l>
     <l n="172">To soothe her anger , conscious that he lied ;</l>
     <l n="173">If thus he grasp 'd at such usurious gains ,</l>
     <l n="174">He must deserve , and should expect her pains . ”</l>
     <l n="175">The charge was strong ; he would in part confess</l>
     <l n="176">Offence there was — But , who offended less ?</l>
     <l n="177">“ What ! is a mere assertion call 'd a lie ?</l>
     <l n="178">And if it be , are men compell 'd to buy ?</l>
     <l n="179">‘ Twas strange that Conscience on such points should dwell ,</l>
     <l n="180">While he was acting ( he would call it ) well ;</l>
     <l n="181">He bought as others buy , he sold as others sell ;</l>
     <l n="182">There was no fraud , and he demanded cause</l>
     <l n="183">Why he was troubled when he kept the laws ? ”</l>
     <l n="184">“ My laws ! ” said Conscience . “ What , ” said he , “ are thine ?</l>
     <l n="185">Oral or written , human or divine ?</l>
     <l n="186">Show me the chapter , let me see the text ;</l>
     <l n="187">By laws uncertain subjects are perplex 'd :</l>
     <l n="188">Let me my finger on the statute lay ,</l>
     <l n="189">And I shall feel it duty to obey . ”</l>
     <l n="190">“ Reflect , ” said Conscience , “ ‘ twas your own desire</l>
     <l n="191">That I should warn you — does the compact tire ?</l>
     <l n="192">Repent you this ?— then bid me not advise ,</l>
     <l n="193">And rather hear your passions as they rise :</l>
     <l n="194">So you may counsel and remonstrance shun ;</l>
     <l n="195">But then remember it is war begun ;</l>
     <l n="196">And you may judge from some attacks , my friend ,</l>
     <l n="197">What serious conflicts will on war attend . ”</l>
     <l n="198">“ Nay , but , ” at length the thoughtful man replied ,</l>
     <l n="199">“ I say not that ; I wish you for my guide ;</l>
     <l n="200">Wish for your checks and your reproofs — but then</l>
     <l n="201">Be like a conscience of my fellow-men ;</l>
     <l n="202">Worthy I mean , and men of good report ,</l>
     <l n="203">And not the wretches who with Conscience sport :</l>
     <l n="204">There 's Bice , my friend , who passes off his grease</l>
     <l n="205">Of pigs for bears ’ , in pots a crown apiece ;</l>
     <l n="206">His Conscience never checks him when he swears</l>
     <l n="207">The fat he sells is honest fat of bears ;</l>
     <l n="208">And so it is , for he contrives to give</l>
     <l n="209">A drachm to each — ‘ tis thus that tradesmen live ;</l>
     <l n="210">Now why should you and I be over-nice ?</l>
     <l n="211">What man is held in more repute than Bice ? ”</l>
     <l n="212">Here ended the dispute ; but yet ‘ twas plain</l>
     <l n="213">The parties both expected strife again :</l>
     <l n="214">Their friendship cool 'd , he look 'd about and saw</l>
     <l n="215">Numbers who seem 'd unshackled by his awe ;</l>
     <l n="216">While like a schoolboy he was threatened still ,</l>
     <l n="217">Now for the deed , now only for the will :</l>
     <l n="218">Here Conscience answered “ To thy neighbour 's guide</l>
     <l n="219">Thy neighbour leave , and in thine own confide . ”</l>
     <l n="220">Such were each day the charges and replies ,</l>
     <l n="221">When a new object caught the trader 's eyes ;</l>
     <l n="222">A Vestry-patriot , could he gain the name ,</l>
     <l n="223">Would famous make him , and would pay the fame .</l>
     <l n="224">He knew full well the sums bequeath 'd in charge</l>
     <l n="225">For schools , for almsmen , for the poor , were large ;</l>
     <l n="226">Report had told , and he could feel it true ,</l>
     <l n="227">That most unfairly dealt the trusted few ;</l>
     <l n="228">No partners would they in their office take ,</l>
     <l n="229">Nor clear accounts at annual meetings make .</l>
     <l n="230">Aloud our hero in the vestry spoke</l>
     <l n="231">Of hidden deeds , and vow 'd to draw the cloak ;</l>
     <l n="232">It was the poor man 's cause , and he for one</l>
     <l n="233">Was quite determined to see justice done :</l>
     <l n="234">His foes affected , laughter , then disdain ,</l>
     <l n="235">They too were Ioud ; and threat'ning , but in vain ;</l>
     <l n="236">The pauper 's friend , their foe , arose and spoke again ;</l>
     <l n="237">Fiercely he cried , “ Your garbled statements show</l>
     <l n="238">That you determine we shall nothing know ;</l>
     <l n="239">But we shall bring your hidden crimes to light ,</l>
     <l n="240">Give you to shame , and to the poor their right . ”</l>
     <l n="241">Virtue like this might some approval ask -</l>
     <l n="242">But Conscience sternly said , “ You wear a mask ! ”</l>
     <l n="243">“ At least , ” said Fulham , “ if I have a view</l>
     <l n="244">To serve myself , I serve the public too . ”</l>
     <l n="245">Fulham , though check 'd , retain 'd his former zeal ,</l>
     <l n="246">And this the cautious rogues began to feel :</l>
     <l n="247">“ Thus will he ever bark , ” in peevish tone</l>
     <l n="248">An elder cried — “ the cur must have a bone . ”</l>
     <l n="249">They then began to hint , and to begin</l>
     <l n="250">Was all they needed — it was felt within :</l>
     <l n="251">In terms less veil 'd an offer then was made ;</l>
     <l n="252">Though distant still , it fail 'd not to persuade :</l>
     <l n="253">More plainly then was every point proposed ,</l>
     <l n="254">Approved , accepted , and the bargain closed .</l>
     <l n="255">The exulting paupers hail 'd their Friend 's success ,</l>
     <l n="256">And bade adieu to murmurs and distress .</l>
     <l n="257">Alas ! their Friend had now superior light ,</l>
     <l n="258">And , view 'd by that , he found that all was right ;</l>
     <l n="259">“ There were no errors , the disbursements small ;</l>
     <l n="260">This was the truth , and truth was due to all . ”</l>
     <l n="261">And rested Conscience ? No ! she would not rest ,</l>
     <l n="262">Yet was content with making a protest :</l>
     <l n="263">Some acts she now with less resistance bore ,</l>
     <l n="264">Nor took alarm so quickly as before :</l>
     <l n="265">Like those in towns besieged , who every ball</l>
     <l n="266">At first with terror view , and dread them all ;</l>
     <l n="267">But , grown familiar with the scenes , they fear</l>
     <l n="268">The clanger less , as it approaches near ;</l>
     <l n="269">So Conscience , more familiar with the view</l>
     <l n="270">Of growing evils , less attentive grew :</l>
     <l n="271">Yet he , who felt some pain and dreaded more ,</l>
     <l n="272">Gave a peace-offering to the angry poor .</l>
     <l n="273">Thus had he quiet — but the time was brief ;</l>
     <l n="274">From his new triumph sprang a cause of grief ;</l>
     <l n="275">In office join 'd , and acting with the rest ,</l>
     <l n="276">He must admit the sacramental test .</l>
     <l n="277">Now , as a sectary , he had all his life ,</l>
     <l n="278">As he supposed , been with the Church at strife : -</l>
     <l n="279">No rules of hers , no laws had he perused ,</l>
     <l n="280">Nor knew the tenets he by rote abused ;</l>
     <l n="281">Yet Conscience here arose more fierce and strong</l>
     <l n="282">Than when she told of robbery and wrong .</l>
     <l n="283">“ Change his religion ! No ! he must be sure</l>
     <l n="284">That was a blow no Conscience eould endure . ”</l>
     <l n="285">Though friend to Virtue , yet she oft abides</l>
     <l n="286">In early notions , fix 'd by erring guides ;</l>
     <l n="287">And is more startled by a call from those ,</l>
     <l n="288">Than when the foulest crimes her rest oppose :</l>
     <l n="289">By error taught , by prejudice misled ,</l>
     <l n="290">She yields her rights , and Fancy rules instead ;</l>
     <l n="291">When Conscience all her stings and terror deals ,</l>
     <l n="292">Not as Truth dictates , but as Fancy feels :</l>
     <l n="293">And thus within our hero 's troubled breast ,</l>
     <l n="294">Crime was less torture than the odious test .</l>
     <l n="295">New forms , new measures , he must now embrace ,</l>
     <l n="296">With sad conviction that they warr 'd with grace ;</l>
     <l n="297">To his new church no former friend would come ,</l>
     <l n="298">They scarce preferr 'd her to the Church of Rome ;</l>
     <l n="299">But thinking much , and weighing guilt and gain ,</l>
     <l n="300">Conscience and he commuted for her pain ;</l>
     <l n="301">Then promised Fulham to retain his creed ,</l>
     <l n="302">And their peculiar paupers still to feed ;</l>
     <l n="303">Their attic-room ( in secret ) to attend ,</l>
     <l n="304">And not forget he was the preacher 's friend :</l>
     <l n="305">Thus he proposed , and Conscience , troubled , tried ,</l>
     <l n="306">And wanting peace , reluctantly complied .</l>
     <l n="307">Now , care subdued , and apprehensions gone ,</l>
     <l n="308">In peace our hero went aspiring on ;</l>
     <l n="309">But short the period — soon a quarrel rose ,</l>
     <l n="310">Fierce in the birth , and fatal in the close ;</l>
     <l n="311">With times of truce between , which rather proved</l>
     <l n="312">That both were weary , than that either loved .</l>
     <l n="313">Fulham e'en now disliked the heavy thrall ,</l>
     <l n="314">And for her death would in his anguish call ,</l>
     <l n="315">As Rome 's mistaken friend exclaimed , ‘ Let Carthage fall , ’</l>
     <l n="316">So felt our hero , so his wish express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="317">Against this powerful sprite — delenda est :</l>
     <l n="318">Rome in her conquest saw not danger near ,</l>
     <l n="319">Freed from her rival and without a fear ;</l>
     <l n="320">So , Conscience conquer 'd , men perceive how free ,</l>
     <l n="321">But not how fatal , such a state must be .</l>
     <l n="322">Fatal , not free , our hero 's ; foe or friend ,</l>
     <l n="323">Conscience on him was destined to attend :</l>
     <l n="324">She dozed indeed , grew dull , nor seem 'd to spy</l>
     <l n="325">Crime following crime , and each of deeper dye ;</l>
     <l n="326">But all were noticed , and the reckoning time</l>
     <l n="327">With her account came on — crime following crime .</l>
     <l n="328">This , once a foe , now Brother in the Trust ,</l>
     <l n="329">Whom Fulham late described as fair and just ,</l>
     <l n="330">Was the sole Guardian of a wealthy maid ,</l>
     <l n="331">Placed in his power , and of his frown afraid :</l>
     <l n="332">Not quite an idiot , for her busy brain</l>
     <l n="333">Sought , by poor cunning , trifling points to gain ;</l>
     <l n="334">Success in childish projects her delight ,</l>
     <l n="335">She took no heed of each important right .</l>
     <l n="336">The friendly parties met — the Guardian cried ,</l>
     <l n="337">“ I am too old ; my sons have each a bride :</l>
     <l n="338">Martha , my ward , would make an easy wife :</l>
     <l n="339">On easy terms I 'll make her yours for life ;</l>
     <l n="340">And then the creature is so weak and mild .</l>
     <l n="341">She may be soothed and threaten 'd as a child . ”</l>
     <l n="342">“ Yet not obey , ” said Fulham , “ for your fools ,</l>
     <l n="343">Female and male , are obstinate as mules . ”</l>
     <l n="344">Some points adjusted , these new friends agreed ,</l>
     <l n="345">Proposed the day , and hurried on the deed .</l>
     <l n="346">“ ‘ Tis a vile act , ” said Conscience . “ It will prove , ”</l>
     <l n="347">Replied the bolder man , “ an act of love :</l>
     <l n="348">Her wicked guardian might the girl have sold</l>
     <l n="349">To endless misery for a tyrant 's gold ;</l>
     <l n="350">Now may her life be happy — for I mean</l>
     <l n="351">To keep my temper even and serene . ”</l>
     <l n="352">“ I cannot thus compound , ” the spirit cried ,</l>
     <l n="353">“ Nor have my laws thus broken and defied :</l>
     <l n="354">This is a fraud , a bargain for a wife ;</l>
     <l n="355">Expect my vengeance , or amend your life . ”</l>
     <l n="356">The Wife was pretty , trifling , childish , weak ;</l>
     <l n="357">She could not think , but would not cease to speak .</l>
     <l n="358">This he forbade — she took the caution ill ,</l>
     <l n="359">And boldly rose against his sovereign will ;</l>
     <l n="360">With idiot-cunning she would watch the hour ,</l>
     <l n="361">When friends were present , to dispute his power :</l>
     <l n="362">With tyrant-craft , he then was still and calm ,</l>
     <l n="363">But raised in private terror and alarm :</l>
     <l n="364">By many trials , she perceived how far</l>
     <l n="365">To vex and tease , without an open war ;</l>
     <l n="366">And he discovered that so weak a mind</l>
     <l n="367">No art could lead , and no compulsion bind ;</l>
     <l n="368">The rudest force would fail such mind to tame ,</l>
     <l n="369">And she was callous to rebuke and shame ;</l>
     <l n="370">Proud of her wealth , the power of law she knew ,</l>
     <l n="371">And would assist him in the spending too :</l>
     <l n="372">His threat'ning words with insult she defied ,</l>
     <l n="373">To all his reasoning with a stare replied ;</l>
     <l n="374">And when he begg 'd her to attend , would say ,</l>
     <l n="375">“ Attend I will — but let me have my way . ”</l>
     <l n="376">Nor rest had Conscience : “ While you merit pain</l>
     <l n="377">From me , ” she cried , “ you seek redress in vain . ”</l>
     <l n="378">His thoughts were grievous : “ All that I possess</l>
     <l n="379">From this vile bargain adds to my distress ;</l>
     <l n="380">To pass a life with one who will not mend ,</l>
     <l n="381">Who cannot love , nor save , nor wisely spend ,</l>
     <l n="382">Is a vile prospect , and I see no end :</l>
     <l n="383">For if we part , I must of course restore</l>
     <l n="384">Much of her money , and must wed no more .</l>
     <l n="385">“ Is there no way ? ” — Here Conscience rose in power , -</l>
     <l n="386">“ Oh ! fly the danger of this fatal hour ;</l>
     <l n="387">I am thy Conscience , faithful , fond , and true :</l>
     <l n="388">Ah , fly this thought , or evil must ensue ;</l>
     <l n="389">Fall on thy knees , and pray with all thy soul ,</l>
     <l n="390">Thy purpose banish , thy design control :</l>
     <l n="391">Let every hope of such advantage cease ,</l>
     <l n="392">Or never more expect a moment 's peace . ”</l>
     <l n="393">Th ’ affrighten 'd man a due attention paid ,</l>
     <l n="394">Felt the rebuke , and the command obey 'd .</l>
     <l n="395">Again the wife rebell 'd , again express 'd</l>
     <l n="396">A love for pleasure — a contempt of rest ;</l>
     <l n="397">“ She whom she pleased would visit , would receive</l>
     <l n="398">Those who pleased her , nor deign to ask for leave . ”</l>
     <l n="399">“ One way there is , ” said he ; “ I might contrive</l>
     <l n="400">Into a trap this foolish thing to drive :</l>
     <l n="401">Who pleased her , said she ?— I 'll be certain who . ”</l>
     <l n="402">“ Take heed , ” said Conscience “ what thou mean'st to do ;</l>
     <l n="403">Ensnare thy wife ? ” — “ Why , yes , ” he must confess ,</l>
     <l n="404">“ It might be wrong , but there was no redress ;</l>
     <l n="405">Beside to think , ” said he , “ is not to sin . ”</l>
     <l n="406">“ Mistaken man ! ” replied the power within .</l>
     <l n="407">No guest unnoticed to the lady came ,</l>
     <l n="408">He judged th ’ event with mingled joy and shame ;</l>
     <l n="409">Oft he withdrew , and seem 'd to leave her free ,</l>
     <l n="410">But still as watchful as a lynx was he ;</l>
     <l n="411">Meanwhile the wife was thoughtless , cool , and gay ,</l>
     <l n="412">And , without virtue , had no wish to stray .</l>
     <l n="413">Though thus opposed , his plans were not resign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="414">“ Revenge , ” said he , “ will prompt that daring mind ;</l>
     <l n="415">Refused supplies , insulted and distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="416">Enraged with me , and near a favourite guest -</l>
     <l n="417">Then will her vengeance prompt the daring deed ,</l>
     <l n="418">And I shall watch , detect her , and be freed . ”</l>
     <l n="419">There was a youth — but let me hide the name ,</l>
     <l n="420">With all the progress of this deed of shame ;</l>
     <l n="421">He had his views — on him the husband cast</l>
     <l n="422">His net , and saw him in his trammels fast .</l>
     <l n="423">“ Pause but a moment — think what you intend , ”</l>
     <l n="424">Said the roused Sleeper : “ I am yet a friend .</l>
     <l n="425">Must all our days in enmity be spent ? ”</l>
     <l n="426">“ No ! ” and he paused — “ I surely shall repent : ”</l>
     <l n="427">Then hurried on — the evil plan was laid ,</l>
     <l n="428">The wife was guilty , and her friend betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="429">And Fulham gain 'd his wish , and for his will was paid .</l>
     <l n="430">Had crimes less weighty on the spirit press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="431">This troubled Conscience might have sunk to rest ;</l>
     <l n="432">And , like a foolish guard , been bribed to peace ,</l>
     <l n="433">By a false promise , that offence should cease ;</l>
     <l n="434">Past faults had seem 'd familiar to the view ,</l>
     <l n="435">Confused if many , and obscure though true ;</l>
     <l n="436">And Conscience , troubled with the dull account ,</l>
     <l n="437">Had dropp 'd her tale , and slumber 'd o'er th ’ amount :</l>
     <l n="438">But , struck by daring guilt , alert she rose ,</l>
     <l n="439">Disturb 'd , alarm 'd , and could no more repose :</l>
     <l n="440">All hopes of friendship and of peace were past ,</l>
     <l n="441">And every view with gloom was overcast .</l>
     <l n="442">Hence from that day , that day of shame and sin ,</l>
     <l n="443">Arose the restless enmity within :</l>
     <l n="444">On no resource could Fulham now rely ,</l>
     <l n="445">Doom 'd all expedients , and in vain , to try ;</l>
     <l n="446">For Conscience , roused , sat boldly on her throne ,</l>
     <l n="447">Watch 'd every thought , attack 'd the foe alone ,</l>
     <l n="448">And with envenom 'd sting drew forth the inward groan :</l>
     <l n="449">Expedients fail 'd that brought relief before ,</l>
     <l n="450">In vain his alms gave comfort to the poor ,</l>
     <l n="451">Give what he would , to him the comfort came no more :</l>
     <l n="452">Not prayer avail 'd , and when ( his crimes confess 'd )</l>
     <l n="453">He felt some ease , she said , “ Are they redress 'd ?</l>
     <l n="454">You still retain the profit , and be sure ,</l>
     <l n="455">Long as it lasts , this anguish shall endure . ”</l>
     <l n="456">Fulham still tried to soothe her , cheat , mislead ,</l>
     <l n="457">But Conscience laid her finger on the deed ,</l>
     <l n="458">And read the crime with power , and all that must succeed :</l>
     <l n="459">He tried t'expel her , but was sure to find</l>
     <l n="460">Her strength increased by all that he design 'd ;</l>
     <l n="461">Nor ever was his groan more loud and deep</l>
     <l n="462">Than when refresh 'd she rose from momentary sleep .</l>
     <l n="463">Now desperate grown , weak , harass 'd , and afraid ,</l>
     <l n="464">From new allies he sought for doubtful aid ;</l>
     <l n="465">To thought itself he strove to bid adieu ,</l>
     <l n="466">And from devotions to diversions flew ;</l>
     <l n="467">He took a poor domestic for a slave</l>
     <l n="468">( Though avarice grieved to see the price he gave ) ;</l>
     <l n="469">Upon his board , once frugal , press 'd a load</l>
     <l n="470">Of viands rich the appetite to goad ;</l>
     <l n="471">The long protracted meal , the sparkling cup ,</l>
     <l n="472">Fought with his gloom , and kept his courage up :</l>
     <l n="473">Soon as the morning came , there met his eyes</l>
     <l n="474">Accounts of wealth , that he might reading rise ;</l>
     <l n="475">To profit then he gave some active hours ,</l>
     <l n="476">Till food and wine again should renovate his powers :</l>
     <l n="477">Yet , spite of all defence , of every aid ,</l>
     <l n="478">The watchful Foe her close attention paid ;</l>
     <l n="479">In every thoughtful moment on she press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="480">And gave at once her dagger to his breast ;</l>
     <l n="481">He waked at midnight , and the fears of sin ,</l>
     <l n="482">As waters through a bursten dam , broke in ;</l>
     <l n="483">Nay , in the banquet , with his friends around ,</l>
     <l n="484">When all their cares and half their crimes were drown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="485">Would some chance act awake the slumbering fear ,</l>
     <l n="486">And care and crime in all their strength appear :</l>
     <l n="487">The news is read , a guilty victim swings ,</l>
     <l n="488">And troubled looks proclaim the bosom-stings :</l>
     <l n="489">Some pair are wed ; this brings the wife in view ;</l>
     <l n="490">And some divorced ; this shows the parting too :</l>
     <l n="491">Nor can he hear of evil word or deed ,</l>
     <l n="492">But they to thought , and thought to sufferings lead .</l>
     <l n="493">Such was his life — no other changes came ,</l>
     <l n="494">The hurrying day , the conscious night the same ;</l>
     <l n="495">The night of horror — when he starting cried</l>
     <l n="496">To the poor startled sinner at his side ,</l>
     <l n="497">“ Is it in law ? am I condemned to die ?</l>
     <l n="498">Let me escape !— I 'll give — oh ! let me fly -</l>
     <l n="499">How ! but a dream !— no judges ! dungeon ! chain !</l>
     <l n="500">Or these grim men !— I will not sleep again -</l>
     <l n="501">Wilt thou , dread being ! thus thy promise keep ?</l>
     <l n="502">Day is thy time — and wilt thou murder sleep ?</l>
     <l n="503">Sorrow and want repose , and wilt thou come ,</l>
     <l n="504">Nor give one hour of pure untroubled gloom ?</l>
     <l n="505">“ Oh ! Conscience ! Conscience ! man 's most faithful friend ,</l>
     <l n="506">Him canst thou comfort , ease , relieve , defend ;</l>
     <l n="507">But if he will thy friendly checks forego ,</l>
     <l n="508">Thou art , oh ? woe for me , his deadliest foe ? ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">A wealthy Lord of far-extended land</l>
     <l n="13">Had all that pleased him placed at his command ;</l>
     <l n="14">Widow 'd of late , but finding much relief</l>
     <l n="15">In the world 's comforts , he dismiss 'd his grief ;</l>
     <l n="16">He was by marriage of his daughters eased ,</l>
     <l n="17">And knew his sons could marry if they pleased ;</l>
     <l n="18">Meantime in travel he indulged the boys ,</l>
     <l n="19">And kept no spy nor partner of his joys .</l>
     <l n="20">These joys , indeed , were of the grosser kind ,</l>
     <l n="21">That fed the cravings of an earthly mind ;</l>
     <l n="22">A mind that , conscious of its own excess ,</l>
     <l n="23">Felt the reproach his neighbours would express .</l>
     <l n="24">Long at th ’ indulgent board he loved to sit ,</l>
     <l n="25">Where joy was laughter , and profaneness wit ;</l>
     <l n="26">And such the guest and manners of the hall ,</l>
     <l n="27">No wedded lady on the ‘ Squire would call :</l>
     <l n="28">Here reign 'd a Favourite , and her triumph gain 'd</l>
     <l n="29">O'er other favourites who before had reign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="30">Reserved and modest seemed the nymph to be ,</l>
     <l n="31">Knowing her lord was charm 'd with modesty ;</l>
     <l n="32">For he , a sportsman keen , the more enjoy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="33">The greater value had the thing destroyed .</l>
     <l n="34">Our ‘ Squire declared , that from a wife released ,</l>
     <l n="35">He would no more give trouble to a Priest ;</l>
     <l n="36">Seem 'd it not , then , ungrateful and unkind</l>
     <l n="37">That he should trouble from the priesthood find ?</l>
     <l n="38">The Church he honour 'd , and he gave the due</l>
     <l n="39">And full respect to every son he knew ;</l>
     <l n="40">But envied those who had the luck to meet</l>
     <l n="41">A gentle pastor , civil and discreet ;</l>
     <l n="42">Who never bold and hostile sermon penned ,</l>
     <l n="43">To wound a sinner , or to shame a friend ;</l>
     <l n="44">One whom no being either shunn 'd or fear 'd :</l>
     <l n="45">Such must be loved wherever they appear 'd .</l>
     <l n="46">Not such the stern old Rector of the time ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who soothed no culprit , and who spared no crime ;</l>
     <l n="48">Who would his fears and his contempt express</l>
     <l n="49">For irreligion and licentiousness ;</l>
     <l n="50">Of him our Village Lord , his guests among ,</l>
     <l n="51">By speech vindictive proved his feelings stung .</l>
     <l n="52">“ Were he a bigot , ” said the ‘ Squire , “ whose zeal</l>
     <l n="53">Condemn 'd us all , I should disdain to feel :</l>
     <l n="54">But when a man of parts , in college train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="55">Prates of our conduct , who would not be pain 'd ?</l>
     <l n="56">While he declaims ( where no one dares reply )</l>
     <l n="57">On men abandon 'd , grov'ling in the sty</l>
     <l n="58">( Like beasts in human shape ) of shameless luxury .</l>
     <l n="59">Yet with a patriot 's zeal I stand the shock</l>
     <l n="60">Of vile rebuke , example to his flock :</l>
     <l n="61">But let this Rector , thus severe and proud ,</l>
     <l n="62">Change his wide surplice for a narrow shroud ,</l>
     <l n="63">And I will place within his seat a youth ,</l>
     <l n="64">Train 'd by the Graces to explain the Truth ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then shall the flock with gentle hand be led ,</l>
     <l n="66">By wisdom won , and by compassion fed . ”</l>
     <l n="67">This purposed Teacher was a sister 's son ,</l>
     <l n="68">Who of her children gave the priesthood one ;</l>
     <l n="69">And she had early train 'd for this employ</l>
     <l n="70">The pliant talents of her college-boy :</l>
     <l n="71">At various times her letters painted all</l>
     <l n="72">Her brother 's views — the manners of the Hall ;</l>
     <l n="73">The rector 's harshness , and the mischief made</l>
     <l n="74">By chiding those whom preachers should persuade :</l>
     <l n="75">This led the youth to views of easy life ,</l>
     <l n="76">A friendly patron , an obliging wife ;</l>
     <l n="77">His tithe , his glebe , the garden , and the steed ,</l>
     <l n="78">With books as many as he wish 'd to read .</l>
     <l n="79">All this accorded with the Uncle 's will :</l>
     <l n="80">He loved a priest compliant , easy , still ;</l>
     <l n="81">Sums he had often to his favourite sent ,</l>
     <l n="82">“ To be , ” he wrote , “ in manly freedom spent ;</l>
     <l n="83">For well it pleased his spirit to assist</l>
     <l n="84">An honest lad , who scorn 'd a Methodist . ”</l>
     <l n="85">His mother , too , in her maternal care ,</l>
     <l n="86">Bade him of canting hypocrites beware :</l>
     <l n="87">Who from his duties would his heart seduce ,</l>
     <l n="88">And make his talents of no earthly use .</l>
     <l n="89">Soon must a trial of his worth be made -</l>
     <l n="90">The ancient priest is to the tomb convey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="91">And the Youth summon 'd from a serious friend ,</l>
     <l n="92">His guide and host , new duties to attend .</l>
     <l n="93">Three months before , the nephew and the ‘ Squire</l>
     <l n="94">Saw mutual worth to praise and to admire ;</l>
     <l n="95">And though the one too early left his wine ,</l>
     <l n="96">The other still exclaim 'd — “ My boy will shine :</l>
     <l n="97">Yes , I perceive that he will soon improve ,</l>
     <l n="98">And I shall form the very guide I love ;</l>
     <l n="99">Decent abroad , he will my name defend ,</l>
     <l n="100">And when at home , be social and unbend . ”</l>
     <l n="101">The plan was specious , for the mind of James</l>
     <l n="102">Accorded duly with his uncle 's schemes ;</l>
     <l n="103">He then aspired not to a higher name</l>
     <l n="104">Than sober clerks of moderate talents claim ;</l>
     <l n="105">Gravely to pray , and rev'rendly to preach ,</l>
     <l n="106">Was all he saw , good youth ! within his reach :</l>
     <l n="107">Thus may a mass of sulphur long abide ,</l>
     <l n="108">Cold and inert , but , to the flame applied ,</l>
     <l n="109">Kindling it blazes , and consuming turns</l>
     <l n="110">To smoke and poison , as it boils and burns .</l>
     <l n="111">James , leaving college , to a Preacher stray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="112">What call 'd he knew not — but the call obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="113">Mild , idle , pensive , ever led by those</l>
     <l n="114">Who could some specious novelty propose ;</l>
     <l n="115">Humbly he listen 'd , while the preacher dwelt</l>
     <l n="116">On touching themes , and strong emotions felt ;</l>
     <l n="117">And in this night was fix 'd that pliant will</l>
     <l n="118">To one sole point , and he retains it still .</l>
     <l n="119">At first his care was to himself confined ;</l>
     <l n="120">Himself assured , he gave it to mankind :</l>
     <l n="121">His zeal grew active — honest , earnest zeal ,</l>
     <l n="122">And comfort dealt to him , he long 'd to deal ;</l>
     <l n="123">He to his favourite preacher now withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="124">Was taught to teach , instructed to subdue ,</l>
     <l n="125">And train 'd for ghostly warfare , when the call</l>
     <l n="126">Of his new duties reach 'd him from the Hall .</l>
     <l n="127">Now to the ‘ Squire , although alert and stout ,</l>
     <l n="128">Came unexpected an attack of gout ;</l>
     <l n="129">And the grieved patron felt such serious pain ,</l>
     <l n="130">He never thought to see a church again :</l>
     <l n="131">Thrice had the youthful rector taught the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="132">Whose growing numbers spoke his powers aloud ,</l>
     <l n="133">Before the patron could himself rejoice</l>
     <l n="134">( His pain still lingering ) in the general voice ;</l>
     <l n="135">For he imputed all this early fame</l>
     <l n="136">To graceful manner and the well-known name ;</l>
     <l n="137">And to himself assumed a share of praise ,</l>
     <l n="138">For worth and talents he was pleased to raise .</l>
     <l n="139">A month had flown , and with it fled disease ;</l>
     <l n="140">What pleased before , began again to please ;</l>
     <l n="141">Emerging daily from his chamber 's gloom ,</l>
     <l n="142">He found his old sensations hurrying home ;</l>
     <l n="143">Then call 'd his nephew , and exclaim 'd , “ My boy ,</l>
     <l n="144">Let us again the balm of life enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="145">The foe has left me , and I deem it right ,</l>
     <l n="146">Should he return , to arm me for the fight . ”</l>
     <l n="147">Thus spoke the ‘ Squire , the favourite nymph stood by ,</l>
     <l n="148">And view 'd the priest with insult in her eye ;</l>
     <l n="149">She thrice had heard him when he boldly spoke</l>
     <l n="150">On dangerous points , and fear 'd he would revoke :</l>
     <l n="151">For James she ioved not — and her manner told ,</l>
     <l n="152">“ This warm affection will be quickly cold : ”</l>
     <l n="153">And still she fear 'd impression might be made</l>
     <l n="154">Upon a subject nervous and decay 'd ;</l>
     <l n="155">She knew her danger , and had no desire</l>
     <l n="156">Of reformation in the gallant ‘ Squire ;</l>
     <l n="157">And felt an envious pleasure in her breast</l>
     <l n="158">To see the rector daunted and distress 'd .</l>
     <l n="159">Again the Uncle to the youth applied -</l>
     <l n="160">“ Cast , my dear lad , that cursed gloom aside :</l>
     <l n="161">There are for all things time and place ; appear</l>
     <l n="162">Grave in your pulpit , and be merry here :</l>

     <l n="164">And the best prelude to a long discourse . ”</l>
     <l n="165">James half obey 'd , but cast an angry eye</l>
     <l n="166">On the fair lass , who still stood watchful by ;</l>
     <l n="167">Resolving thus , “ I have my fears — but still</l>
     <l n="168">I must perform my duties , and I will :</l>
     <l n="169">No love , no interest , shall my mind control ;</l>
     <l n="170">Better to lose my comforts than my soul ;</l>
     <l n="171">Better my uncle 's favour to abjure ,</l>
     <l n="172">Than the upbraidings of my heart endure . ”</l>
     <l n="173">He took his glass , and then address 'd the ‘ Squire :</l>
     <l n="174">“ I feel not well , permit me to retire . ”</l>
     <l n="175">The ‘ Squire conceived that the ensuing day</l>
     <l n="176">Gave him these terrors for the grand essay ,</l>
     <l n="177">When he himself should this young preacher try ,</l>
     <l n="178">And stand before him with observant eye ;</l>
     <l n="179">This raised compassion in his manly breast ,</l>
     <l n="180">And he would send the rector to his rest ;</l>
     <l n="181">Yet first , in soothing voice — “ A moment stay ,</l>
     <l n="182">And these suggestions of a friend obey ;</l>
     <l n="183">Treasure these hints , if fame or peace you prize , -</l>

     <l n="186">To prove his talents , and insure his friends :</l>
     <l n="187">First , of the first — your stores at once produce ;</l>
     <l n="188">And bring your reading to its proper use :</l>
     <l n="189">On doctrines dwell , and every point enforce</l>
     <l n="190">By quoting much , the scholar 's sure resource ;</l>

     <l n="197">Be it that faith the orthodox maintain ,</l>
     <l n="198">Found in the rubric , what the creeds explain ;</l>
     <l n="199">Fail not to show us on this ancient faith</l>

     <l n="201">Dwell not one moment on a faith that shocks</l>
     <l n="202">The minds of men sincere and orthodox ;</l>
     <l n="203">That gloomy faith , that robs the wounded mind</l>
     <l n="204">Of all the comfort it was wont to find</l>
     <l n="205">From virtuous acts , and to the soul denies</l>
     <l n="206">Its proper due for alms and charities ;</l>
     <l n="207">That partial faith , that , weighing sins alone ,</l>
     <l n="208">Lets not a virtue for a fault atone ;</l>
     <l n="209">That partial faith , that would our tables clear ,</l>
     <l n="210">And make one dreadful Lent of all the year ;</l>
     <l n="211">And cruel too , for this is faith that rends</l>
     <l n="212">Confiding beauties from protecting friends ;</l>
     <l n="213">A faith that all embracing , what a gloom</l>
     <l n="214">Deep and terrific o'er the land would come !</l>
     <l n="215">What scenes of horror would that time disclose !</l>
     <l n="216">No sight but misery , and no sound but woes ;</l>
     <l n="217">Your nobler faith , in loftier style convey 'd ,</l>

     <l n="229">Shun all resemblance to that forward race</l>
     <l n="230">Who preach of sins before a sinner 's face ;</l>
     <l n="231">And seem as if they overlook 'd a pew ,</l>
     <l n="232">Only to drag a failing man in view :</l>

     <l n="242">How errors cloud us , and how sins defile :</l>
     <l n="243">Here bring persuasive tropes and figures forth ,</l>
     <l n="244">To show the poor that wealth is nothing worth ;</l>

     <l n="250">That vice you combat , in the abstract — vice :</l>
     <l n="251">The very captious will be quiet then ;</l>
     <l n="252">We all confess we are offending men :</l>
     <l n="253">In lashing sin , of every stroke beware ,</l>
     <l n="254">For sinners feel , and sinners you must spare ;</l>
     <l n="255">In general satire , every man perceives</l>
     <l n="256">A slight attack , yet neither fears nor grieves ;</l>
     <l n="257">But name th ’ offence , and you absolve the rest ,</l>
     <l n="258">And point the dagger at a single breast .</l>
     <l n="259">“ Yet are there sinners of a class so low ,</l>

     <l n="263">And all the better sort , who see your zeal ,</l>

     <l n="274">The Nephew answer 'd not , except a sigh</l>
     <l n="275">And look of sorrow might be term 'd reply ;</l>
     <l n="276">He saw the fearful hazard of his state ,</l>
     <l n="277">And held with truth and safety strong debate ;</l>
     <l n="278">Nor long he reason 'd , for the zealous youth</l>
     <l n="279">Resolved , though timid , to profess the truth ;</l>
     <l n="280">And though his friend should like a lion roar ,</l>
     <l n="281">Truth would he preach , and neither less nor more .</l>
     <l n="282">The bells had toll 'd — arrived the time of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="283">The flock assembled , and the ‘ Squire was there :</l>
     <l n="284">And now can poet sing , or proseman say ,</l>
     <l n="285">The disappointment of that trying day ?</l>
     <l n="286">As he who long had train 'd a favourite steed ,</l>
     <l n="287">( Whose blood and bone gave promise of his speed ,)</l>
     <l n="288">Sanguine with hope , he runs with partial eye</l>
     <l n="289">O'er every feature , and his bets are high ;</l>
     <l n="290">Of triumph sure , he sees the rivals start ,</l>
     <l n="291">And waits their coming with exulting heart ;</l>
     <l n="292">Forestalling glory , with impatient glance ,</l>
     <l n="293">And sure to see his conquering steed advance :</l>
     <l n="294">The conquering steed advances — luckless day !</l>
     <l n="295">A rival 's Herod bears the prize away ,</l>
     <l n="296">Nor second his , nor third , but lagging last ,</l>
     <l n="297">With hanging head he comes , by all surpass 'd :</l>
     <l n="298">Surprise and wrath the owner 's mind inflame ,</l>
     <l n="299">Love turns to scorn , and glory ends in shame ; -</l>
     <l n="300">Thus waited , high in hope , the partial ‘ Squire ,</l>
     <l n="301">Eager to hear , impatient to admire ;</l>
     <l n="302">When the young Preacher , in the tones that find</l>
     <l n="303">A certain passage to the kindling mind ,</l>
     <l n="304">With air and accent strange , impressive , sad ,</l>
     <l n="305">Alarm 'd the judge — he trembled for the lad ;</l>
     <l n="306">But when the text announced the power of grace ,</l>
     <l n="307">Amazement scowl 'd upon his clouded face</l>
     <l n="308">At this degenerate son of his illustrious race ;</l>
     <l n="309">Staring he stood , till hope again arose</l>
     <l n="310">That James might well define the words he chose :</l>
     <l n="311">For this he listen 'd — but , alas ! he found</l>
     <l n="312">The preacher always on forbidden ground .</l>
     <l n="313">And now the Uncle left the hated pew ,</l>
     <l n="314">With James , and James 's conduct , in his view ;</l>
     <l n="315">A long farewell to all his favourite schemes !</l>
     <l n="316">For now no crazed fanatic 's frantic dreams</l>
     <l n="317">Seem 'd vile as James 's conduct , or as James :</l>
     <l n="318">All he had long derided , hated , fear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="319">This , from the chosen youth , the uncle heard ; -</l>
     <l n="320">The needless pause , the fierce disorder 'd air ,</l>
     <l n="321">The groan for sin , the vehemence of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="322">Gave birth to wrath , that , in a long discourse</l>
     <l n="323">Of grace triumphant , rose to fourfold force :</l>
     <l n="324">He found his thoughts despised , his rules transgress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="325">And while the anger kindled in his breast ,</l>
     <l n="326">The pain must be endured that could not be expressed :</l>
     <l n="327">Each new idea more inflamed his ire ,</l>
     <l n="328">As fuel thrown upon a rising fire :</l>
     <l n="329">A hearer yet , he sought by threatening sign</l>
     <l n="330">To ease his heart , and awe the young divine ;</l>
     <l n="331">But James refused those angry looks to meet ,</l>
     <l n="332">Till he dismiss 'd his flock , and left his seat :</l>
     <l n="333">Exhausted then he felt his trembling frame ,</l>
     <l n="334">But fix 'd his soul ,— his sentiments the same ;</l>
     <l n="335">And therefore wise it seem 'd to fly from rage ,</l>
     <l n="336">And seek for shelter in his parsonage :</l>
     <l n="337">There , if forsaken , yet consoled to find</l>
     <l n="338">Some comforts left , though not a few resign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="339">There , if he lost an erring parent 's love ,</l>
     <l n="340">An honest conscience must the cause approve ;</l>
     <l n="341">If the nice palate were no longer fed ,</l>
     <l n="342">The mind enjoy 'd delicious thoughts instead ;</l>
     <l n="343">And if some part of earthly good was flown ,</l>
     <l n="344">Still was the tithe of ten good farms his own .</l>
     <l n="345">Fear now , and discord , in the village reign ,</l>
     <l n="346">The cool remonstrate , and the meek complain ;</l>
     <l n="347">But there is war within , and wisdom pleads in vain .</l>
     <l n="348">Now dreads the Uncle , and proclaims his dread ,</l>
     <l n="349">Lest the Boy-priest should turn each rustic head ;</l>
     <l n="350">The certain converts cost him certain woe ,</l>
     <l n="351">The doubtful fear lest they should join the foe :</l>
     <l n="352">Matrons of old , with whom he used to joke ,</l>
     <l n="353">Now pass his Honour with a pious look ;</l>
     <l n="354">Lasses , who met him once with lively airs ,</l>
     <l n="355">Now cross his way , and gravely walk to prayers :</l>
     <l n="356">An old companion , whom he long has loved ,</l>
     <l n="357">By coward fears confess 'd his conscience moved ;</l>
     <l n="358">As the third bottle gave its spirit forth ,</l>
     <l n="359">And they bore witness to departing worth ,</l>
     <l n="360">The friend arose , and he too would depart :</l>
     <l n="361">“ Man , ” said the ‘ Squire , “ thou wert not wont to start ;</l>
     <l n="362">Hast thou attended to that foolish boy ,</l>
     <l n="363">Who would abridge all comforts , or destroy ? ”</l>
     <l n="364">Yes , he had listen 'd , who had slumber 'd long ,</l>
     <l n="365">And was convinced that something must be wrong :</l>
     <l n="366">But , though affected , still his yielding heart ,</l>
     <l n="367">And craving palate , took the Uncle 's part ;</l>
     <l n="368">Wine now oppress 'd him , who , when free from wine ,</l>
     <l n="369">Could seldom clearly utter his design ;</l>
     <l n="370">But though by nature and indulgence weak ,</l>
     <l n="371">Yet , half converted , he resolved to speak ;</l>
     <l n="372">And , speaking , own 'd , “ that in his mind the Youth</l>
     <l n="373">Had gifts and learning , and that truth was truth :</l>
     <l n="374">The ‘ Squire he honour 'd , and for his poor part ,</l>
     <l n="375">He hated nothing like a hollow heart :</l>
     <l n="376">But ‘ twas a maxim he had often tried ,</l>
     <l n="377">That right was right , and there he would abide ;</l>
     <l n="378">He honoured learning , and he would confess</l>
     <l n="379">The preacher had his talents — more or less :</l>
     <l n="380">Why not agree ? he thought the young divine</l>
     <l n="381">Had no such strictness — they might drink and dine ;</l>
     <l n="382">For them sufficient — but he said before</l>
     <l n="383">That truth was truth , and he would drink no more . ”</l>
     <l n="384">This heard the ‘ Squire with mix 'd contempt and pain ;</l>
     <l n="385">He fear 'd the Priest this recreant sot would gain .</l>
     <l n="386">The favourite Nymph , though not a convert made ,</l>
     <l n="387">Conceived the man she scorn 'd her cause would aid ,</l>
     <l n="388">And when the spirits of her lord were low ,</l>
     <l n="389">The lass presumed the wicked cause to show ;</l>
     <l n="390">“ It was the wretched life his Honour led ,</l>
     <l n="391">And would draw vengeance on his guilty head ;</l>
     <l n="392">Their loves ( Heav'n knew how dreadfully distressed</l>
     <l n="393">The thought had made her ! ) were as yet unbless 'd :</l>
     <l n="394">And till the church had sanction 'd ” — Here she saw</l>
     <l n="395">The wrath that forced her trembling to withdraw .</l>
     <l n="396">Add to these outward ills some inward light ,</l>
     <l n="397">That showed him all was not correct and right :</l>
     <l n="398">Though now he less indulged — and to the poor ,</l>
     <l n="399">From day to day , sent alms from door to door ;</l>
     <l n="400">Though he some ease from easy virtues found ,</l>
     <l n="401">Yet conscience told him he could not compound ,</l>
     <l n="402">But must himself the darling sin deny ,</l>
     <l n="403">Change the whole heart ,— but here a heavy sigh</l>
     <l n="404">Proclaim 'd , “ How vast the toil ! and , ah ! how weak am I ! ”</l>
     <l n="405">James too has trouble — he divided sees</l>
     <l n="406">A parish , once harmonious and at ease ;</l>
     <l n="407">With him united are the simply meek ,</l>
     <l n="408">The warm , the sad , the nervous , and the weak ;</l>
     <l n="409">The rest his Uncle 's , save the few beside ,</l>
     <l n="410">Who own no doctrine , and obey no guide ;</l>
     <l n="411">With stragglers of each adverse camp , who lend</l>
     <l n="412">Their aid to both , but each in turn offend .</l>
     <l n="413">Though zealous still , yet he begins to feel</l>
     <l n="414">The heat too fierce that glows in vulgar zeal ;</l>
     <l n="415">With pain he hears his simple friends relate</l>
     <l n="416">Their week 's experience , and their woful state ;</l>
     <l n="417">With small temptation struggling every hour ,</l>
     <l n="418">And bravely battling with the tempting power :</l>
     <l n="419">His native sense is hurt by strange complaints</l>
     <l n="420">Of inward motions in these warring saints ;</l>
     <l n="421">Who never cast on sinful bait a look ,</l>
     <l n="422">But they perceive the devil at the hook :</l>
     <l n="423">Grieved , yet compell 'd to smile , he finds it hard</l>
     <l n="424">Against the blunders of conceit to guard ;</l>
     <l n="425">He sighs to hear the jests his converts cause ,</l>
     <l n="426">He cannot give their erring zeal applause ;</l>
     <l n="427">But finds it inconsistent to condemn</l>
     <l n="428">The flights and follies he has nursed in them :</l>
     <l n="429">These , in opposing minds , contempt produce ,</l>
     <l n="430">Or mirth occasion , or provoke abuse ;</l>
     <l n="431">On each momentous theme disgrace they bring ,</l>
     <l n="432">And give to Scorn her poison and her sting .</l>

     <l n="28">In one whose looks were with such meaning fraught ,</l>
     <l n="29">For on a Lady , as an humble friend ,</l>
     <l n="30">It was her painful office to attend .</l>
     <l n="31">Her duties here were of the usual kind -</l>
     <l n="32">And some the body harass 'd , some the mind :</l>
     <l n="33">Billets she wrote , and tender stories read ,</l>
     <l n="34">To make the Lady sleepy in her bed ;</l>
     <l n="35">She play 'd at whist , but with inferior skill ,</l>
     <l n="36">And heard the summons as a call to drill ;</l>
     <l n="37">Music was ever pleasant till she play 'd</l>
     <l n="38">At a request that no request convey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="39">The Lady 's tales with anxious looks she heard ,</l>
     <l n="40">For she must witness what her Friend averr 'd ;</l>
     <l n="41">The Lady 's taste she must in all approve ,</l>
     <l n="42">Hate whom she hated , whom she lov 'd must love ;</l>
     <l n="43">These , with the various duties of her place ,</l>
     <l n="44">With care she studied , and perform 'd with grace :</l>
     <l n="45">She veil 'd her troubles in a mask of ease ,</l>
     <l n="46">And show 'd her pleasure was a power to please .</l>
     <l n="47">Such were the damsel 's duties : she was poor -</l>
     <l n="48">Above a servant , but with service more :</l>
     <l n="49">Men on her face with careless freedom gaz 'd ,</l>
     <l n="50">Nor thought how painful was the glow they raised .</l>
     <l n="51">A wealthy few to gain her favour tried ,</l>
     <l n="52">But not the favour of a grateful bride ;</l>
     <l n="53">They spoke their purpose with an easy air ,</l>
     <l n="54">That shamed and frighten 'd the dependent fair ;</l>
     <l n="55">Past time she view 'd , the passing time to cheat ,</l>
     <l n="56">But nothing found to make the present sweet :</l>
     <l n="57">With pensive soul she read life 's future page ,</l>
     <l n="58">And saw dependent , poor , repining age .</l>
     <l n="59">But who shall dare t'assert what years may bring ,</l>
     <l n="60">When wonders from the passing hour may spring ?</l>
     <l n="61">There dwelt a Yeoman in the place , whose mind</l>
     <l n="62">Was gentle , generous , cultivated , kind ;</l>
     <l n="63">For thirty years he labour 'd ; fortune then</l>
     <l n="64">Placed the mild rustic with superior men :</l>
     <l n="65">A richer Stafford who had liv 'd to save ,</l>
     <l n="66">What he had treasured to the poorer gave ;</l>
     <l n="67">Who with a sober mind that treasure view 'd ,</l>
     <l n="68">And the slight studies of his youth renew 'd :</l>
     <l n="69">He not profoundly , but discreetly read ,</l>
     <l n="70">And a fair mind with useful culture fed ;</l>
     <l n="71">Then thought of marriage — “ But the great , ” said he</l>
     <l n="72">“ I shall not suit , nor will the meaner me . ”</l>
     <l n="73">Anna , he saw , admired her modest air ;</l>
     <l n="74">He thought her virtuous , and he knew her fair ;</l>
     <l n="75">Love raised his pity for her humble state ,</l>
     <l n="76">And prompted wishes for her happier fate ;</l>
     <l n="77">No pride in money would his feelings wound ,</l>
     <l n="78">Nor vulgar manners hurt him and confound :</l>
     <l n="79">He then the Lady at the Hall address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="80">Sought her consent , and his regard expressed :</l>
     <l n="81">Yet if some cause his earnest wish denied ,</l>
     <l n="82">He begg 'd to know it , and he bow 'd and sigh 'd .</l>
     <l n="83">The Lady own 'd that she was loth to part ,</l>
     <l n="84">But praised the damsel for her gentle heart ,</l>
     <l n="85">Her pleasing person , and her blooming health ,</l>
     <l n="86">But ended thus , “ Her virtue is her wealth . ”</l>
     <l n="87">“ Then is she rich ! ” he cried with lively air ;</l>
     <l n="88">“ But whence , so please you , came a lass so fair ? ”</l>
     <l n="89">“ A placeman 's child was Anna , one who died</l>
     <l n="90">And left a widow by afflictions tried ;</l>
     <l n="91">She to support her infant daughter strove ,</l>
     <l n="92">But early left the object of her love :</l>
     <l n="93">Her youth , her beauty , and her orphan state</l>
     <l n="94">Gave a kind countess interest in her fate :</l>
     <l n="95">With her she dwelt and still might dwelling be ,</l>
     <l n="96">When the earl 's folly caused the lass to flee ;</l>
     <l n="97">A second friend was she compell 'd to shun ,</l>
     <l n="98">By the rude offers of an uncheek 'd son ;</l>
     <l n="99">I found her then , and with a mother 's love</l>
     <l n="100">Regard the gentle girl whom you approve ;</l>
     <l n="101">Yet e'en with me protection is not peace ,</l>
     <l n="102">Nor man 's designs nor beauty 's trials cease :</l>
     <l n="103">Like sordid boys by costly fruit they feel -</l>
     <l n="104">They will not purchase , but they try to steal . ”</l>
     <l n="105">Now this good Lady , like a witness true ,</l>
     <l n="106">Told but the truth , and all the truth she knew ;</l>
     <l n="107">And ‘ tis our duty and our pain to show</l>
     <l n="108">Truth this good lady had not means to know .</l>
     <l n="109">Yes , there was lock 'd within the damsel 's breast</l>
     <l n="110">A fact important to be now confess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="111">Gently , my muse , th ’ afflicting tale relate ,</l>
     <l n="112">And have some feeling for a sister 's fate .</l>
     <l n="113">Where Anna dwelt , a conquering hero came , -</l>
     <l n="114">An Irish captain , Sedley was his name ;</l>
     <l n="115">And he too had that same prevailing art ,</l>
     <l n="116">That gave soft wishes to the virgin 's heart :</l>
     <l n="117">In years they differ 'd ; he had thirty seen</l>
     <l n="118">When this young beauty counted just fifteen ;</l>
     <l n="119">But still they were a lovely lively pair ,</l>
     <l n="120">And trod on earth as if they trod on air .</l>
     <l n="121">On love , delightful theme ! the captain dwelt</l>
     <l n="122">With force still growing with the hopes he felt</l>
     <l n="123">But with some caution and reluctance told ,</l>
     <l n="124">He had a father crafty , harsh , and old ;</l>
     <l n="125">Who , as possessing much , would much expert ,</l>
     <l n="126">Or both , for ever , from his love reject :</l>
     <l n="127">Why then offence to one so powerful give ,</l>
     <l n="128">Who ( for their comfort ) had not long to live ?</l>
     <l n="129">With this poor prospect the deluded maid ,</l>
     <l n="130">In words confiding , was indeed betray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="131">And , soon as terrors in her bosom rose ,</l>
     <l n="132">The hero fled ; they hinder 'd his repose .</l>
     <l n="133">Deprived of him , she to a parent 's breast</l>
     <l n="134">Her secret trusted , and her pains impress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="135">Let her to town ( so prudence urged ) repair ,</l>
     <l n="136">To shun disgrace , at least to hide it there ;</l>
     <l n="137">But ere she went , the luckless damsel pray 'd</l>
     <l n="138">A chosen friend might lend her timely aid :</l>
     <l n="139">“ Yes ! my soul 's sister , my Eliza , come ,</l>
     <l n="140">Hear her last sigh , and ease thy Anna 's doom . ”</l>
     <l n="141">“ ‘ Tis a fool 's wish , ” the angry father cried ,</l>
     <l n="142">But , lost in troubles of his own , complied ;</l>
     <l n="143">And dear Eliza to her friend was sent ,</l>
     <l n="144">T'indulge that wish , and be her punishment .</l>
     <l n="145">The time arrived , and brought a tenfold dread ;</l>
     <l n="146">The time was past , and all the terror fled ;</l>
     <l n="147">The infant died ; the face resumed each charm ,</l>
     <l n="148">And reason now brought trouble and alarm .</l>
     <l n="149">Should her Eliza — no ! she was too just ,</l>
     <l n="150">“ Too good and kind — but ah ! too young to trust . ”</l>
     <l n="151">Anna return 'd , her former place resumed ,</l>
     <l n="152">And faded beauty with now grace re-bloom 'd ;</l>
     <l n="153">And if some whispers of the past were heard ,</l>
     <l n="154">They died innoxious , as no cause appear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="155">But other cares on Anna 's bosom press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="156">She saw her father gloomy and distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="157">He died o'erwhelmed with debt , and soon was shed</l>
     <l n="158">The filial sorrow o'er a mother dead :</l>
     <l n="159">She sought Eliza 's arms — that faithful friend was wed ;</l>
     <l n="160">Then was compassion by the countess shown ,</l>
     <l n="161">And all th ’ adventures of her life are known .</l>
     <l n="162">And now , beyond her hopes — no longer tried</l>
     <l n="163">By slavish awe — she lived a Yoeman 's bride ;</l>
     <l n="164">Then bless 'd her lot , and with a grateful mind</l>
     <l n="165">Was careful , cheerful , vigilant , and kind :</l>
     <l n="166">The gentle husband felt supreme delight ,</l>
     <l n="167">Bless 'd by her joy , and happy in her sight ;</l>
     <l n="168">He saw with pride in every friend and guest</l>
     <l n="169">High admiration and regard express 'd :</l>
     <l n="170">With greater pride , and with superior joy ,</l>
     <l n="171">He look 'd exulting on his first-born boy ;</l>
     <l n="172">To her fond breast the wife her infant strain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="173">Some feelings utter 'd , some were not explain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="174">And she enraptured with her treasure grew ,</l>
     <l n="175">The sight familiar , but the pleasure new .</l>
     <l n="176">Yet there appear 'd within that tranquil state</l>
     <l n="177">Some threat'ning prospect of uncertain fate ;</l>
     <l n="178">Between the married when a secret lies ,</l>
     <l n="179">It wakes suspicion from enforced disguise :</l>
     <l n="180">Still thought the Wife upon her absent friend ,</l>
     <l n="181">With all that must upon her truth depend .</l>
     <l n="182">" There is no being in the world beside</l>
     <l n="183">Who can discover what that friend will hide :</l>
     <l n="184">Who knew the fact , knew not my name or state ,</l>
     <l n="185">Who these can tell cannot the fact relate ;</l>
     <l n="186">But thou , Eliza , canst the whole impart ,</l>
     <l n="187">And all my safety is thy generous heart . ”</l>
     <l n="188">Mix 'd with these fears — but light and transient these -</l>
     <l n="189">Fled years of peace , prosperity , and ease ;</l>
     <l n="190">So tranquil all , that scarce a gloomy day</l>
     <l n="191">For days of gloom unmix 'd prepared the way :</l>
     <l n="192">One eve , the Wife , still happy in her state ,</l>
     <l n="193">Sang gaily , thoughtless of approaching fate ;</l>
     <l n="194">Then came a letter , that ( received in dread</l>
     <l n="195">Not unobserved ) she in confusion read ;</l>
     <l n="196">The substance this — “ Her friend rejoiced to find</l>
     <l n="197">That she had riches with a grateful mind ;</l>
     <l n="198">While poor Eliza had , from place to place ,</l>
     <l n="199">Been lured by hope to labour for disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="200">That every scheme her wandering husband tried ,</l>
     <l n="201">Pain 'd while he lived , and perish 'd when he died . ”</l>
     <l n="202">She then of want in angry style complain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="203">Her child a burthen to her life remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="204">Her kindred shunn 'd her prayers , no friend her soul sustain 'd .</l>
     <l n="205">“ Yet why neglected ? Dearest Anna knew</l>
     <l n="206">Her worth once tried , her friendship ever true ;</l>
     <l n="207">She hoped , she trusted , though by wants oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="208">To lock the treasured secret in her breast ;</l>
     <l n="209">Yet , vex 'd by trouble , must apply to one ,</l>
     <l n="210">For kindness due to her for kindness done . ”</l>
     <l n="211">In Anna 's mind was tumult , in her face</l>
     <l n="212">Flushings of dread had momentary place :</l>
     <l n="213">“ I must , ” she judged , “ these cruel lines expose ,</l>
     <l n="214">Or fears , or worse than fears , my crime disclose . ”</l>
     <l n="215">The letter shown , he said , with sober smile , -</l>
     <l n="216">“ Anna , your Friend has not a friendly style :</l>
     <l n="217">Say , where could you with this fair lady dwell ,</l>
     <l n="218">Who boasts of secrets that she scorns to tell ? ”</l>
     <l n="219">“ At school , ” she answer 'd : he “ At school ! ” replied ;</l>
     <l n="220">“ Nay , then I know the secrets you would hide ;</l>
     <l n="221">Some early longings these , without dispute ,</l>
     <l n="222">Some youthful gaspings for forbidden fruit :</l>
     <l n="223">Why so disorder 'd , love ? are such the crimes</l>
     <l n="224">That give us sorrow in our graver times ?</l>
     <l n="225">Come , take a present for your friend , and rest</l>
     <l n="226">In perfect peace — you find you are confess 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="227">This cloud , though past , alarm 'd the conscious wife ,</l>
     <l n="228">Presaging gloom and sorrow for her life ;</l>
     <l n="229">Who to her answer join 'd a fervent prayer</l>
     <l n="230">That her Eliza would a sister spare :</l>
     <l n="231">If she again — but was there cause ?— should send ,</l>
     <l n="232">Let her direct — and then she named a friend :</l>
     <l n="233">A sad expedient untried friends to trust ,</l>
     <l n="234">And still to fear the tried may be unjust :</l>
     <l n="235">Such is his pain , who , by his debt oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="236">Seeks by new bonds a temporary rest .</l>
     <l n="237">Few were her peaceful days till Anna read</l>
     <l n="238">The words she dreaded , and had cause to dread : -</l>
     <l n="239">“ Did she believe , did she , unkind , suppose</l>
     <l n="240">That thus Eliza 's friendship was to close ?</l>
     <l n="241">No , though she tried , and her desire was plain ,</l>
     <l n="242">To break the friendly bond , she strove in vain :</l>
     <l n="243">Ask 'd she for silence ? why so loud the call ,</l>
     <l n="244">And yet the token of her love so small ?</l>
     <l n="245">By means like these will you attempt to bind</l>
     <l n="246">And check the movements of an injured mind ?</l>
     <l n="247">Poor as I am , I shall be proud to show</l>
     <l n="248">What dangerous secrets I may safely know :</l>
     <l n="249">Secrets to men of jealous minds convey 'd</l>
     <l n="250">Have many a noble house in ruins laid ;</l>
     <l n="251">Anna , I trust , although with wrongs beset ,</l>
     <l n="252">And urged by want , I shall be faithful yet ;</l>
     <l n="253">But what temptation may from these arrive ,</l>
     <l n="254">To take a slighted woman by surprise ,</l>
     <l n="255">Becomes a subject for your serious care -</l>
     <l n="256">For who offends , must for offence prepare . ”</l>
     <l n="257">Perplex 'd , dismay 'd , the Wife foresaw her doom ;</l>
     <l n="258">A day deferr 'd was yet a day to come ;</l>
     <l n="259">But still , though painful her suspended state ,</l>
     <l n="260">She dreaded more the crisis of her fate ;</l>
     <l n="261">Better to die than Stafford 's scorn to meet ,</l>
     <l n="262">And her strange friend perhaps would be discreet .</l>
     <l n="263">Presents she sent , and made a strong appeal</l>
     <l n="264">To woman 's feelings , begging her to feel ;</l>
     <l n="265">With too much force she wrote of jealous men ,</l>
     <l n="266">And her tears falling spoke beyond the pen ;</l>
     <l n="267">Eliza 's silence she again implored ,</l>
     <l n="268">And promised all that prudence could afford .</l>
     <l n="269">For looks composed and careless Anna tried ;</l>
     <l n="270">She seem 'd in trouble , and unconscious sigh 'd :</l>
     <l n="271">The faithful Husband , who devoutly loved</l>
     <l n="272">His silent partner , with concern reproved :</l>
     <l n="273">“ What secret sorrows on my Anna press ,</l>
     <l n="274">That love may not partake , nor care redress ? ”</l>
     <l n="275">“ None , none , ” she answer 'd , with a look so kind</l>
     <l n="276">That the fond man determined to be blind .</l>
     <l n="277">A few succeeding weeks of brief repose</l>
     <l n="278">In Anna 's cheek revived the faded rose ;</l>
     <l n="279">A hue like this the western sky displays ,</l>
     <l n="280">That glows awhile , and withers as we gaze .</l>
     <l n="281">Again the Friend 's tormenting letter came -</l>
     <l n="282">“ The wants she suffer 'd were affection 's shame ;</l>
     <l n="283">She with her child a life of terrors led ,</l>
     <l n="284">Unhappy fruit , but of a lawful bed :</l>
     <l n="285">Her friend was tasting every bliss in life ,</l>
     <l n="286">The joyful mother , and the wealthy wife ;</l>
     <l n="287">While she was placed in doubt , in fear , in want ,</l>
     <l n="288">To starve on trifles that the happy grant ;</l>
     <l n="289">Poorly for all her faithful silence paid ,</l>
     <l n="290">And tantalized by ineffectual aid :</l>
     <l n="291">She could not thus a beggar 's lot endure ;</l>
     <l n="292">She wanted something permanent and sure :</l>
     <l n="293">If they were friends , then equal be their lot ,</l>
     <l n="294">And she were free to speak if they were not . ”</l>
     <l n="295">Despair and terror seized the Wife , to find</l>
     <l n="296">The artful workings of a vulgar mind :</l>
     <l n="297">Money she had not , but the hint of dress</l>
     <l n="298">Taught her new bribes , new terrors to redress ;</l>
     <l n="299">She with such feeling then described her woes</l>
     <l n="300">That envy 's self might on the view repose ;</l>
     <l n="301">Then to a mother 's pains she made appeal ,</l>
     <l n="302">And painted grief like one compell 'd to feel .</l>
     <l n="303">Yes ! so she felt , that in her air , her face ,</l>
     <l n="304">In every purpose , and in every place ,</l>
     <l n="305">In her slow motion , in her languid mien ,</l>
     <l n="306">The grief , the sickness of her soul , was seen .</l>
     <l n="307">Of some mysterious ill , the Husband sure ,</l>
     <l n="308">Desired to trace it , for he hoped to cure ;</l>
     <l n="309">Something he knew obscurely , and had seen</l>
     <l n="310">His wife attend a cottage on the green ;</l>
     <l n="311">Love , loth to wound , endured conjecture long ,</l>
     <l n="312">Till fear would speak , and spoke in language strong .</l>
     <l n="313">“ All I must know , my Anna — truly know</l>
     <l n="314">Whence these emotions , terrors , trouble flow :</l>
     <l n="315">Give me thy grief , and I will fairly prove</l>
     <l n="316">Mine is no selfish , no ungenerous love . ”</l>
     <l n="317">Now Anna 's soul the seat of strife became ,</l>
     <l n="318">Fear with respect contended , love with shame :</l>
     <l n="319">But fear prevailing was the ruling guide ,</l>
     <l n="320">Prescribing what to show and what to hide .</l>
     <l n="321">“ It is my friend , ” she said — “ but why disclose</l>
     <l n="322">A woman 's weakness struggling with her woes ?</l>
     <l n="323">Yes , she has grieved me by her fond complaints ,</l>
     <l n="324">The wrongs she suffers , the distress she paints :</l>
     <l n="325">Something we do — but she afflicts me still ,</l>
     <l n="326">And says , with power to help , I want the will ;</l>
     <l n="327">This plaintive style I pity and excuse ,</l>
     <l n="328">Help when I can , and grieve when I refuse ;</l>
     <l n="329">But here my useless sorrows I resign ,</l>
     <l n="330">And will be happy in a love like thine . ”</l>
     <l n="331">The Husband doubted : he was kind but cool : -</l>
     <l n="332">“ ‘ Tis a strong friendship to arise at school ;</l>
     <l n="333">Once more then , love , once more the sufferer aid , -</l>
     <l n="334">I too can pity , but I must upbraid :</l>
     <l n="335">Of these vain feelings then thy bosom free ,</l>
     <l n="336">Nor be o'erwhelm ' d by useless sympathy . ”</l>
     <l n="337">The Wife again despatch 'd the useless bribe ,</l>
     <l n="338">Again essay 'd her terrors to describe ;</l>
     <l n="339">Again with kindest words entreated peace ,</l>
     <l n="340">And begg 'd her offerings for a time might cease .</l>
     <l n="341">A calm succeeded , but too like the one</l>
     <l n="342">That causes terror ere the storm comes on :</l>
     <l n="343">A secret sorrow lived in Anna 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="344">In Stafford 's mind a secret fear of art ;</l>
     <l n="345">Not long they lasted — this determined foe</l>
     <l n="346">Knew all her claims , and nothing would forego .</l>
     <l n="347">Again her letter came , where Anna read ,</l>
     <l n="348">“ My child , one cause of my distress , is dead :</l>
     <l n="349">Heav'n has my infant . ” — “ Heartless wretch ! ” she cried</l>
     <l n="350">“ Is this thy joy ? ” — “ I am no longer tied :</l>
     <l n="351">Now will I , hast'ning to my friend , partake</l>
     <l n="352">Her cares and comforts , and no more forsake ;</l>
     <l n="353">Now shall we both in equal station move ,</l>
     <l n="354">Save that my friend enjoys a husband 's love . ”</l>
     <l n="355">Complaint and threats so strong the Wife amazed ,</l>
     <l n="356">Who wildly on her cottage-neighbour gazed ;</l>
     <l n="357">Her tones , her trembling , first betray 'd her grief ,</l>
     <l n="358">When floods of tears gave anguish its relief .</l>
     <l n="359">She fear 'd that Stafford would refuse assent ,</l>
     <l n="360">And knew her selfish Friend would not relent ;</l>
     <l n="361">She must petition , yet delay 'd the task ,</l>
     <l n="362">Ashamed , afraid , and yet compell 'd to ask ;</l>
     <l n="363">Unknown to him some object fill 'd her mind ,</l>
     <l n="364">And , once suspicious , he became unkind :</l>
     <l n="365">They sat one evening , each absorb 'd in gloom ,</l>
     <l n="366">When , hark ! a noise ; and , rushing to the room ,</l>
     <l n="367">The Friend tripp 'd lightly in , and laughing said , “ I come . ”</l>
     <l n="368">Anna received her with an anxious mind ,</l>
     <l n="369">And meeting whisper 'd , “ Is Eliza kind ? ”</l>
     <l n="370">Reserved and cool the Husband sought to prove</l>
     <l n="371">The depth and force of this mysterious love .</l>
     <l n="372">To nought that pass 'd between the Stranger-friend</l>
     <l n="373">And his meek partner seem 'd he to attend ;</l>
     <l n="374">But , anxious , listened to the lightest word</l>
     <l n="375">That might some knowledge of his guest afford ,</l>
     <l n="376">And learn the reason one to him so dear</l>
     <l n="377">Should feel such fondness , yet betray such fear .</l>
     <l n="378">Soon he perceived this uninvited guest ,</l>
     <l n="379">Unwelcome too , a sovereign power possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="380">Lofty she was and careless , while the meek</l>
     <l n="381">And humbled Anna was afraid to speak :</l>
     <l n="382">As mute she listen 'd with a painful smile ,</l>
     <l n="383">Her friend sat laughing , and at ease the while ,</l>
     <l n="384">Telling her idle tales with all the glee</l>
     <l n="385">Of careless and unfeeling levity .</l>
     <l n="386">With calm good sense he knew his Wife endued ,</l>
     <l n="387">And now with wounded pride her conduct view 'd ;</l>
     <l n="388">Her speech was low , her every look convey 'd -</l>
     <l n="389">“ I am a slave , subservient and afraid . ”</l>
     <l n="390">All trace of comfort vanish 'd ; if she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="391">The noisy friend upon her purpose broke ;</l>
     <l n="392">To her remarks with insolence replied ,</l>
     <l n="393">And her assertions doubted or denied :</l>
     <l n="394">While the meek Anna like an infant shook ,</l>
     <l n="395">Woe-struck and trembling at the serpent 's look .</l>
     <l n="396">“ There is , ” said Stafford , “ yes , there is a cause -</l>
     <l n="397">This creature frights her , overpowers , and awes . ”</l>
     <l n="398">Six weeks had pass 'd — “ In truth , my love , this friend</l>
     <l n="399">Has liberal notions ; what does she intend ?</l>
     <l n="400">Without a hint she came , and will she stay</l>
     <l n="401">Till she receives the hint to go away ? ”</l>
     <l n="402">Confused the Wife replied , in spite of truth ,</l>
     <l n="403">“ I love the dear companion of my youth . ”</l>
     <l n="404">“ ‘ Tis well , ” said Stafford ; “ then your loves renew :</l>
     <l n="405">Trust me , your rivals , Anna , will be few . ”</l>
     <l n="406">Though playful this , she felt too much distress 'd</l>
     <l n="407">T'admit the consolation of a jest .</l>
     <l n="408">Ill she reposed , and in her dreams would sigh ,</l>
     <l n="409">And , murmuring forth her anguish , beg to die ;</l>
     <l n="410">With sunken eye , slow pace , and pallid cheek ,</l>
     <l n="411">She look 'd confusion , and she fear 'd to speak .</l>
     <l n="412">All this the Friend beheld , for , quick of sight ,</l>
     <l n="413">She knew the husband eager for her flight ;</l>
     <l n="414">And that by force alone she could retain</l>
     <l n="415">The lasting comforts she had hope to gain .</l>
     <l n="416">She now perceived , to win her post for life ,</l>
     <l n="417">She must infuse fresh terrors in the wife ;</l>
     <l n="418">Must bid to friendship 's feebler ties adieu ,</l>
     <l n="419">And boldly claim the object in her view :</l>
     <l n="420">She saw the husband 's love , and knew the power</l>
     <l n="421">Her friend might use in some propitious hour .</l>
     <l n="422">Meantime the anxious Wife , from pure distress</l>
     <l n="423">Assuming courage , said , “ I will confess ; ”</l>
     <l n="424">But with her children felt a parent 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="425">And sought once more the hated truth to hide .</l>
     <l n="426">Offended , grieved , impatient , Stafford bore</l>
     <l n="427">The odious change , till he could bear no more :</l>
     <l n="428">A friend to truth , in speech and action plain ,</l>
     <l n="429">He held all fraud and cunning in disdain ;</l>
     <l n="430">But fraud to find , and falsehood to detect ,</l>
     <l n="431">For once he fled to measures indirect .</l>
     <l n="432">One day the Friends were seated in that room</l>
     <l n="433">The Guest with care adorn 'd , and named her home .</l>
     <l n="434">To please the eye , there curious prints were placed ,</l>
     <l n="435">And some light volumes to amuse the taste ;</l>
     <l n="436">Letters and music on a table laid ,</l>
     <l n="437">The favourite studies of the fair betray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="438">Beneath the window was the toilet spread ,</l>
     <l n="439">And the fire gleam 'd upon a crimson bed .</l>
     <l n="440">In Anna 's looks and falling tears were seen</l>
     <l n="441">How interesting had their subjects been :</l>
     <l n="442">“ Oh ! then , ” resumed the Friend , “ I plainly find</l>
     <l n="443">That you and Stafford know each other 's mind ;</l>
     <l n="444">I must depart , must on the world be thrown ,</l>
     <l n="445">Like one discarded , worthless , and unknown ;</l>
     <l n="446">But , shall I carry , and to please a foe ,</l>
     <l n="447">A painful secret in my bosom ? No !</l>
     <l n="448">Think not your Friend a reptile you may tread</l>
     <l n="449">Beneath your feet , and say , the worm is dead ;</l>
     <l n="450">I have some feeling , and will not be made</l>
     <l n="451">The scorn of her whom love cannot persuade :</l>
     <l n="452">Would not your word , your slightest wish , effect</l>
     <l n="453">All that I hope , petition , or expect ?</l>
     <l n="454">The power you have , but you the use decline -</l>
     <l n="455">Proof that you feel not , or you fear not mine .</l>
     <l n="456">There was a time when I , a tender maid ,</l>
     <l n="457">Flew at a call , and your desires obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="458">A very mother to the child became ,</l>
     <l n="459">Consoled your sorrow , and conceal 'd your shame ;</l>
     <l n="460">But now , grown rich and happy , from the door</l>
     <l n="461">You thrust a bosom-friend , despised and poor ;</l>
     <l n="462">That child alive , its mother might have known</l>
     <l n="463">The hard , ungrateful spirit she had shown . ”</l>
     <l n="464">Here paused the Guest , and Anna cried at length -</l>
     <l n="465">“ You try me , cruel friend ! beyond my strength ;</l>
     <l n="466">Would I had been beside my infant laid ,</l>
     <l n="467">Where none would vex me , threaten , or upbraid ! ”</l>
     <l n="468">In Anna 's looks the Friend beheld despair ;</l>
     <l n="469">Her speech she soften 'd , and composed her air ;</l>
     <l n="470">Yet , while professing love , she answer 'd still -</l>
     <l n="471">“ You can befriend me , but you want the will . ”</l>
     <l n="472">They parted thus , and Anna went her way ,</l>
     <l n="473">To shed her secret sorrows , and to pray .</l>
     <l n="474">Stafford , amused with books , and fond of home ,</l>
     <l n="475">By reading oft dispell 'd the evening gloom ;</l>
     <l n="476">History or tale — all heard him with delight ,</l>
     <l n="477">And thus was pass 'd this memorable night .</l>
     <l n="478">The listening Friend bestow 'd a flattering smile :</l>
     <l n="479">A sleeping boy the mother held the while ;</l>
     <l n="480">And ere she fondly bore him to his bed ,</l>
     <l n="481">On his fair face the tear of anguish shed .</l>
     <l n="482">And now his task resumed , “ My tale , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="483">“ Is short and sad , short may our sadness be ! ”</l>
     <l n="484">“ The Caliph Harun , as historians tell , { 5 }</l>
     <l n="485">Ruled , for a tyrant , admirably well ;</l>
     <l n="486">Where his own pleasures were not touch 'd , to men</l>
     <l n="487">He was humane , and sometimes even then .</l>
     <l n="488">Harun was fond of fruits and gardens fair ,</l>
     <l n="489">And woe to all whom he found poaching there :</l>
     <l n="490">Among his pages was a lively Boy ,</l>
     <l n="491">Eager in search of every trifling joy ;</l>
     <l n="492">His feelings vivid , and his fancy strong ,</l>
     <l n="493">He sigh 'd for pleasure while he shrank from wrong :</l>
     <l n="494">When by the Caliph in the garden placed ,</l>
     <l n="495">He saw the treasures which he long 'd to taste ;</l>
     <l n="496">And oft alone he ventured to behold</l>
     <l n="497">Rich hanging fruits with rind of glowing gold ;</l>
     <l n="498">Too long he stay 'd forbidden bliss to view ,</l>
     <l n="499">His virtue failing as his longings grew ;</l>
     <l n="500">Athirst and wearied with the noontide heat ,</l>
     <l n="501">Fate to the garden led his luckless feet ;</l>
     <l n="502">With eager eyes and open mouth he stood ,</l>
     <l n="503">Smelt the sweet breath , and touch 'd the fragrant food ;</l>
     <l n="504">The tempting beauty sparkling in the sun</l>
     <l n="505">Charm 'd his young sense — he ate , and was undone ;</l>
     <l n="506">When the fond glutton paused , his eyes around</l>
     <l n="507">He turn 'd , and eyes upon him turning found ;</l>
     <l n="508">Pleased he beheld the spy , a brother-page .</l>
     <l n="509">A friend allied in office and in age ;</l>
     <l n="510">Who promised much that secret he would be ,</l>
     <l n="511">But high the price he fix 'd in secrecy :</l>
     <l n="512">“ ‘ Were you suspected , my unhappy friend , ’</l>
     <l n="513">Began the boy , ‘ where would your sorrows end ?</l>
     <l n="514">In all the palace there is not a page</l>
     <l n="515">The Caliph would not torture in his rage :</l>
     <l n="516">I think I see thee now impaled alive ,</l>
     <l n="517">Writhing in pangs — but come , my friend ! revive ;</l>
     <l n="518">Had some beheld you , all your purse contains</l>
     <l n="519">Could not have saved you from terrific pains ;</l>
     <l n="520">I scorn such meanness ; and , if not in debt ,</l>
     <l n="521">Would not an asper on your folly set . ’</l>
     <l n="522">“ The hint was strong ; young Osmyn search 'd his store</l>
     <l n="523">For bribes , and found he soon could bribe no more ;</l>
     <l n="524">That time arrived , for Osmyn 's stock was small ,</l>
     <l n="525">And the young tyrant now possess 'd it all ;</l>
     <l n="526">The cruel youth , with his companions near ,</l>
     <l n="527">Gave the broad hint that raised the sudden fear ;</l>
     <l n="528">Th ’ ungenerous insult now was daily shown ,</l>
     <l n="529">And Osmyn 's peace and honest pride were flown ;</l>
     <l n="530">Then came augmenting woes , and fancy strong</l>
     <l n="531">Drew forms of suffering , a tormenting throng ;</l>
     <l n="532">He felt degraded , and the struggling mind</l>
     <l n="533">Dared not be free , and could not be resign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="534">And all his pains and fervent prayers obtain 'd</l>
     <l n="535">Was truce from insult , while the fears remain 'd .</l>
     <l n="536">“ One day it chanced that this degraded Boy</l>
     <l n="537">And tyrant-friend were fixed at their employ ;</l>
     <l n="538">Who now had thrown restraint and form aside ,</l>
     <l n="539">And for his bribe in plainer speech applied :</l>
     <l n="540">‘ Long have I waited , and the last supply</l>
     <l n="541">Was but a pittance , yet how patient I !</l>
     <l n="542">But give me now what thy first terrors gave ,</l>
     <l n="543">My speech shall praise thee , and my silence save . ’</l>
     <l n="544">“ Osmyn had found , in many a dreadful day ,</l>
     <l n="545">The tyrant fiercer when he seem 'd in play :</l>
     <l n="546">He begg 'd forbearance : ‘ I have not to give ;</l>
     <l n="547">Spare me awhile , although ‘ tis pain to live :</l>
     <l n="548">Oh ! had that stolen fruit the power possess 'd</l>
     <l n="549">To war with life , I now had been at rest . ’</l>
     <l n="550">“ ‘ So fond of death , ’ replied the Boy , ‘'tis plain</l>
     <l n="551">Thou hast no certain notion of the pain ;</l>
     <l n="552">But to the Caliph were a secret shown ,</l>
     <l n="553">Death has no pain that would be then unknown . ’</l>
     <l n="554">“ Now , ” says the story , “ in a closet near ,</l>
     <l n="555">The monarch seated , chanced the boys to hear ;</l>
     <l n="556">There oft he came , when wearied on his throne ,</l>
     <l n="557">To read , sleep , listen , pray , or be alone .</l>
     <l n="558">“ The tale proceeds , when first the Caliph found</l>
     <l n="559">That he was robb 'd , although alone , he frown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="560">And swore in wrath that he would send the boy</l>
     <l n="561">Far from his notice , favour , or employ ;</l>
     <l n="562">But gentler movements soothed his ruffled mind ,</l>
     <l n="563">And his own failings taught him to be kind .</l>
     <l n="564">“ Relenting thoughts then painted Osmyn young ,</l>
     <l n="565">His passion urgent , and temptation strong ;</l>
     <l n="566">And that he suffer 'd from that villain-Spy</l>
     <l n="567">Pains worse than death , till he desired to die ;</l>
     <l n="568">Then if his morals had received a stain ,</l>
     <l n="569">His bitter sorrows made him pure again :</l>
     <l n="570">To reason , pity lent her powerful aid ,</l>
     <l n="571">For one so tempted , troubled , and betray 'd :</l>
     <l n="572">And a free pardon the glad Boy restored</l>
     <l n="573">To the kind presence of a gentle lord ;</l>
     <l n="574">Who from his office and his country drove</l>
     <l n="575">That traitor-Friend , whom pains nor pray'rs could move :</l>
     <l n="576">Who raised the fears no mortal could endure ,</l>
     <l n="577">And then with cruel av'rice sold the cure .</l>
     <l n="578">“ My tale is ended ; but , to be applied ,</l>
     <l n="579">I must describe the place where Caliphs hide . ”</l>
     <l n="580">Here both the females look 'd alarm 'd , distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="581">With hurried passions hard to be express 'd .</l>
     <l n="582">“ It was a closet by a chamber placed ,</l>
     <l n="583">Where slept a lady of no vulgar taste ;</l>
     <l n="584">Her friend attended in that chosen room</l>
     <l n="585">That she had honour 'd and proclaim 'd her home ;</l>
     <l n="586">To please the eye were chosen pictures placed ;</l>
     <l n="587">And some light volumes to amuse the taste ;</l>
     <l n="588">Letters and music on a table laid ,</l>
     <l n="589">For much the lady wrote , and often play 'd :</l>
     <l n="590">Beneath the window was a toilet spread ,</l>
     <l n="591">And a fire gleamed upon a crimson bed . ”</l>
     <l n="592">He paused , he rose ; with troubled joy the Wife</l>
     <l n="593">Felt the new era of her changeful life ;</l>
     <l n="594">Frankness and love appear 'd in Stafford 's face ,</l>
     <l n="595">And all her trouble to delight gave place .</l>
     <l n="596">Twice made the Guest an effort to sustain</l>
     <l n="597">Her feelings , twice resumed her seat in vain ,</l>
     <l n="598">Nor could suppress her shame , nor could support her pain .</l>
     <l n="599">Quick she retired , and all the dismal night</l>
     <l n="600">Thought of her guilt , her folly , and her flight ;</l>
     <l n="601">Then sought unseen her miserable home ,</l>
     <l n="602">To think of comforts lost , and brood on wants to come .</l>

     <l n="13">And , seldom pardoning , never trust again ;</l>
     <l n="14">Urged by religion , they forgive — but yet</l>
     <l n="15">Guard the warm heart , and never more forget :</l>
     <l n="16">Those are like wax — apply them to the fire ,</l>
     <l n="17">Melting , they take th ’ impressions you desire ;</l>
     <l n="18">Easy to mould and fashion as you please ,</l>
     <l n="19">And again moulded with an equal ease :</l>
     <l n="20">Like smelted iron these the forms retain ,</l>
     <l n="21">But once impress 'd , will never melt again .</l>
     <l n="22">A busy port a serious Merchant made</l>
     <l n="23">His chosen place to recommence his trade ;</l>
     <l n="24">And brought his Lady , who , their children dead ,</l>
     <l n="25">Their native seat of recent sorrow fled :</l>
     <l n="26">The husband duly on the quay was seen ,</l>
     <l n="27">The wife at home became at length serene ;</l>
     <l n="28">There in short time the social couple grew</l>
     <l n="29">With all acquainted , friendly with a few ;</l>
     <l n="30">When the good lady , by disease assail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">In vain resisted — hope and science fail 'd :</l>
     <l n="32">Then spoke the female friends , by pity led ,</l>
     <l n="33">“ Poor merchant Paul ! what think ye ? will he wed ?</l>
     <l n="34">A quiet , easy , kind , religious man ,</l>
     <l n="35">Thus can he rest ?— I wonder if he can . ”</l>
     <l n="36">He too , as grief subsided in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="37">Gave place to notions of congenial kind :</l>
     <l n="38">Grave was the man , as we have told before ;</l>
     <l n="39">His years were forty — he might pass for more ;</l>
     <l n="40">Composed his features were , his stature low ,</l>
     <l n="41">His air important , and his motion slow :</l>
     <l n="42">His dress became him , it was neat and plain ,</l>
     <l n="43">The colour purple , and without a stain ;</l>
     <l n="44">His words were few , and special was his care</l>
     <l n="45">In simplest terms his purpose to declare ;</l>
     <l n="46">A man more civil , sober , and discreet ,</l>
     <l n="47">More grave and corteous , you could seldom meet :</l>
     <l n="48">Though frugal he , yet sumptuous was his board ,</l>
     <l n="49">As if to prove how much he could afford ;</l>
     <l n="50">For though reserved himself , he loved to see</l>
     <l n="51">His table plenteous , and his neighbours free :</l>
     <l n="52">Among these friends he sat in solemn style ,</l>
     <l n="53">And rarely soften 'd to a sober smile :</l>
     <l n="54">For this , observant friends their reason gave -</l>
     <l n="55">“ Concerns so vast would make the idlest grave ;</l>
     <l n="56">And for such man to be of language free ,</l>
     <l n="57">Would seem incongruous as a singing tree :</l>
     <l n="58">Trees have their music , but the birds they shield -</l>
     <l n="59">The pleasing tribute for protection yield ;</l>
     <l n="60">Each ample tree the tuneful choir defends ,</l>
     <l n="61">As this rich merchant cheers his happy friends ! ”</l>
     <l n="62">In the same town it was his chance to meet</l>
     <l n="63">A gentle Lady , with a mind discreet ;</l>
     <l n="64">Neither in life 's decline , nor bloom of youth ,</l>
     <l n="65">One famed for maiden modesty and truth :</l>
     <l n="66">By nature cool , in pious habits bred ,</l>
     <l n="67">She look 'd on lovers with a virgin 's dread :</l>
     <l n="68">Deceivers , rakes , and libertines were they ,</l>
     <l n="69">And harmless beauty their pursuit and prey ;</l>
     <l n="70">As bad as giants in the ancient times</l>
     <l n="71">Were modern lovers , and the same their crimes :</l>
     <l n="72">Soon as she heard of her all-conquering charms ,</l>
     <l n="73">At once she fled to her defensive arms ;</l>
     <l n="74">Conn 'd o'er the tales her maiden aunt had told ,</l>
     <l n="75">And , statue like , was motionless and cold :</l>
     <l n="76">From prayer of love , like that Pygmalion pray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="77">Ere the hard stone became the yielding maid ,</l>
     <l n="78">A different change in this chaste nymph ensued ,</l>
     <l n="79">And turn 'd to stone the breathing flesh and blood :</l>
     <l n="80">Whatever youth described his wounded heart ,</l>
     <l n="81">“ He came to rob her , and she scorn 'd his art ;</l>
     <l n="82">And who of raptures once presumed to speak ,</l>
     <l n="83">Told listening maids he thought them fond and weak ;</l>
     <l n="84">But should a worthy man his hopes display</l>
     <l n="85">In few plain words , and beg a yes or nay ,</l>
     <l n="86">He would deserve an answer just and plain ,</l>
     <l n="87">Since adulation only moved disdain -</l>
     <l n="88">Sir , if my friends object not , come again . ”</l>
     <l n="89">Hence , our grave Lover , though he liked the face ,</l>
     <l n="90">Praised not a feature — dwelt not on a grace ;</l>
     <l n="91">But in the simplest terms declared his state :</l>
     <l n="92">“ A widow 'd man , who wish 'd a virtuous mate ;</l>
     <l n="93">Who fear 'd neglect , and was compell 'd to trust</l>
     <l n="94">Dependants wasteful , idle , or unjust ;</l>
     <l n="95">Or should they not the trusted stores destroy ,</l>
     <l n="96">At best , they could not help him to enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="97">But with her person and her prudence bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="98">His acts would prosper , and his soul have rest :</l>
     <l n="99">Would she be his ? ” — “ Why , that was much to say ;</l>
     <l n="100">She would consider ; he awhile might stay :</l>
     <l n="101">She liked his manners , and believed his word ;</l>
     <l n="102">He did not flatter , flattery she abhorr 'd :</l>
     <l n="103">It was her happy lot in peace to dwell -</l>
     <l n="104">Would change make better what was now so well ?</l>
     <l n="105">But she would ponder . ” “ This , ” he said , “ was kind ; ”</l>
     <l n="106">And begg 'd to know “ when she had fix 'd her mind .</l>
     <l n="107">Romantic maidens would have scorn 'd the air ,</l>
     <l n="108">And the cool prudence of a mind so fair ;</l>
     <l n="109">But well it pleased this wiser maid to find</l>
     <l n="110">Her own mild virtues in her lover 's mind .</l>
     <l n="111">His worldly wealth she sought , and quickly grew</l>
     <l n="112">Pleased with her search , and happy in the view</l>
     <l n="113">Of vessels freighted with abundant stores ,</l>
     <l n="114">Of rooms whose treasures press 'd the groaning floors ;</l>
     <l n="115">And he of clerks and servants could display</l>
     <l n="116">A little army on a public day :</l>
     <l n="117">Was this a man like needy bard to speak</l>
     <l n="118">Of balmy lip , bright eye , or rosy cheek ?</l>
     <l n="119">The sum appointed for her widow 'd state ,</l>
     <l n="120">Fix 'd by her friend , excited no debate ;</l>
     <l n="121">Then the kind lady gave her hand and heart ,</l>
     <l n="122">And , never finding , never dealt with art :</l>
     <l n="123">In his engagements she had no concern ;</l>
     <l n="124">He taught her not , nor had she wish to learn ;</l>
     <l n="125">On him in all occasions she relied ,</l>
     <l n="126">His word her surety , and his worth her pride .</l>
     <l n="127">When ship was launch 'd , and merchant Paul had share ,</l>
     <l n="128">A bounteous feast became the lady 's care ;</l>
     <l n="129">Who then her entry to the dinner made ,</l>
     <l n="130">In costly raiment , and with kind parade .</l>
     <l n="131">Call 'd by this duty on a certain day ,</l>
     <l n="132">And robed to grace it in a rich array ,</l>
     <l n="133">Forth from her room , with measured step she came ,</l>
     <l n="134">Proud of th ’ event , and stately look 'd the dame ;</l>
     <l n="135">The husband met her at his study door -</l>
     <l n="136">“ This way , my love — one moment , and no more :</l>
     <l n="137">A trifling business — you will understand -</l>
     <l n="138">The law requires that you affix your hand ;</l>
     <l n="139">But first attend , and you shall learn the cause</l>
     <l n="140">Why forms like these have been prescribed by laws . ”</l>
     <l n="141">Then from his chair a man in black arose ,</l>
     <l n="142">And with much quickness hurried off his prose -</l>
     <l n="143">That “ Ellen Paul , the wife , and so forth , freed</l>
     <l n="144">From all control , her own the act and deed ,</l>
     <l n="145">And forasmuch ” — said she , “ I 've no distrust ,</l>
     <l n="146">For he that asks it is discreet and just ;</l>
     <l n="147">Our friends are waiting — where am I to sign ? -</l>
     <l n="148">There ?— Now be ready when we meet to dine . ”</l>
     <l n="149">This said , she hurried off in great delight ,</l>
     <l n="150">The ship was launch 'd , and joyful was the night .</l>
     <l n="151">Now , says the reader , and in much disdain ,</l>
     <l n="152">This serious Merchant was a rogue in grain ;</l>
     <l n="153">A treacherous wretch , an artful sober knave ,</l>
     <l n="154">And ten times worse for manners cool and grave :</l>
     <l n="155">And she devoid of sense , to set her hand</l>
     <l n="156">To scoundrel deeds she could not understand .</l>
     <l n="157">Alas ! ‘ tis true ; and I in vain had tried</l>
     <l n="158">To soften crime that cannot be denied ;</l>
     <l n="159">And might have labour 'd many a tedious verse</l>
     <l n="160">The latent cause of mischief to rehearse :</l>
     <l n="161">Be it confess 'd , that long , with troubled look ,</l>
     <l n="162">This Trader view 'd a huge accompting-book ;</l>
     <l n="163">( His former marriage for a time delay 'd</l>
     <l n="164">The dreaded hour , the present lent its aid ;)</l>
     <l n="165">But he too clearly saw the evil day ,</l>
     <l n="166">And put the terror , by deceit , away ;</l>
     <l n="167">Thus , by connecting with his sorrows crime ,</l>
     <l n="168">He gain 'd a portion of uneasy time . -</l>
     <l n="169">All this too late the injur 'd Lady saw :</l>
     <l n="170">What law had given , again she gave to law ;</l>
     <l n="171">His guilt , her folly — these at once impress 'd</l>
     <l n="172">Their lasting feelings on her guileless breast .</l>
     <l n="173">“ Shame I can bear , ” she cried , “ and want sustain ,</l>
     <l n="174">But will not see this guilty wretch again : ”</l>
     <l n="175">For all was lost , and he with many a tear</l>
     <l n="176">Confess 'd the fault — she turning scorn 'd to hear .</l>
     <l n="177">To legal claims he yielded all his worth .</l>
     <l n="178">But small the portion , and the wrong 'd were wroth ,</l>
     <l n="179">Nor to their debtor would a part allow ;</l>
     <l n="180">And where to live he know not — knew not how .</l>
     <l n="181">The Wife a cottage found , and thither went</l>
     <l n="182">The suppliant man , but she would not relent :</l>
     <l n="183">Thenceforth she utter 'd with indignant tone ,</l>
     <l n="184">“ I feel the misery , and will feel alone . ”</l>
     <l n="185">He would turn servant for her sake , would keep</l>
     <l n="186">The poorest school , the very streets would sweep ,</l>
     <l n="187">To show his love . “ It was already shown ,</l>
     <l n="188">And her affliction should be all her own :</l>
     <l n="189">His wants and weakness might have touch 'd her heart ,</l>
     <l n="190">But from his meanness she resolved to part . ”</l>
     <l n="191">In a small alley was she lodged , beside</l>
     <l n="192">Its humblest poor , and at the view she cried ,</l>
     <l n="193">“ Welcome ! yes ! let me welcome , if I can ,</l>
     <l n="194">The fortune dealt me by this cruel man :</l>
     <l n="195">Welcome this low-thatch 'd roof , this shatter 'd door ,</l>
     <l n="196">These walls of clay , this miserable floor ;</l>
     <l n="197">Welcome my envied neighbours ; this to you</l>
     <l n="198">Is all familiar — all to me is new :</l>
     <l n="199">You have no hatred to the loathsome meal ,</l>
     <l n="200">Your firmer nerves no trembling terrors feel ,</l>
     <l n="201">Nor , what you must expose , desire you to conceal ;</l>
     <l n="202">What your coarse feelings bear without offence ,</l>
     <l n="203">Disgusts my taste and poisons every sense :</l>
     <l n="204">Daily shall I your sad relations hear</l>
     <l n="205">Of wanton women and of men severe ;</l>
     <l n="206">There will dire curses , dreadful oaths abound ,</l>
     <l n="207">And vile expressions shock me and confound :</l>
     <l n="208">Noise of dull wheels , and songs with horrid words ,</l>
     <l n="209">Will be the music that this lane affords ;</l>
     <l n="210">Mirth that disgusts , and quarrels that degrade</l>
     <l n="211">The human mind , must my retreat invade :</l>
     <l n="212">Hard is my fate ! yet easier to sustain ,</l>
     <l n="213">Than to abide with guilt and fraud again ;</l>
     <l n="214">A grave impostor ! who expects to meet ,</l>
     <l n="215">In such gray locks and gravity , deceit ?</l>
     <l n="216">Where the sea rages and the billows roar ,</l>
     <l n="217">Men know the danger , and they quit the shore ;</l>
     <l n="218">But , be there nothing in the way descried ,</l>
     <l n="219">When o'er the rocks smooth runs the wicked tide -</l>
     <l n="220">Sinking unwarn 'd , they execrate the shock</l>
     <l n="221">And the dread peril of the sunken rock . ”</l>
     <l n="222">A frowning world had now the man to dread ,</l>
     <l n="223">Taught in no arts , to no profession bred ;</l>
     <l n="224">Pining in grief , beset with constant care</l>
     <l n="225">Wandering he went , to rest he knew not where .</l>
     <l n="226">Meantime the Wife — but she abjured the name -</l>
     <l n="227">Endured her lot , and struggled with the shame ;</l>
     <l n="228">When , lo ! an uncle on the mother 's side ,</l>
     <l n="229">In nature something , as in blood allied ,</l>
     <l n="230">Admired her firmness , his protection gave ,</l>
     <l n="231">And show 'd a kindness she disdain 'd to crave .</l>
     <l n="232">Frugal and rich the man , and frugal grew</l>
     <l n="233">The sister-mind without a selfish view ;</l>
     <l n="234">And further still — the temp'rate pair agreed</l>
     <l n="235">With what they saved the patient poor to feed :</l>
     <l n="236">His whole estate , when to the grave consign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="237">Left the good kinsman to the kindred mind ;</l>
     <l n="238">Assured that law , with spell secure and tight ,</l>
     <l n="239">Had fix 'd it as her own peculiar right .</l>
     <l n="240">Now to her ancient residence removed ,</l>
     <l n="241">She lived as widow , well endowed and loved ;</l>
     <l n="242">Decent her table was , and to her door</l>
     <l n="243">Came daily welcomed the neglected poor :</l>
     <l n="244">The absent sick were soothed by her relief ,</l>
     <l n="245">As her free bounty sought the haunts of grief ;</l>
     <l n="246">A plain and homely charity had she ,</l>
     <l n="247">And loved the objects of her alms to see ;</l>
     <l n="248">With her own hands she dress 'd the savoury meat ,</l>
     <l n="249">With her own fingers wrote the choice receipt ;</l>
     <l n="250">She heard all tales that injured wives relate ,</l>
     <l n="251">And took a double interest in their fate ;</l>
     <l n="252">But of all husbands not a wretch was known</l>
     <l n="253">So vile , so mean , so cruel as her own .</l>
     <l n="254">This bounteous Lady kept an active spy ,</l>
     <l n="255">To search th ’ abodes of want , and to supply ;</l>
     <l n="256">The gentle Susan served the liberal dame -</l>
     <l n="257">Unlike their notions , yet their deeds the same :</l>
     <l n="258">No practised villain could a victim find</l>
     <l n="259">Than this stern Lady more completely blind ;</l>
     <l n="260">Nor ( if detected in his fraud ) could meet</l>
     <l n="261">One less disposed to pardon a deceit ;</l>
     <l n="262">The wrong she treasured , and on no pretence</l>
     <l n="263">Received th ’ offender , or forgot th ’ offence :</l>
     <l n="264">But the kind Servant , to the thrice-proved knave</l>
     <l n="265">A fourth time listen 'd and the past forgave .</l>
     <l n="266">First in her youth , when she was blithe and gay ;</l>
     <l n="267">Came a smooth rogue , and stole her love away :</l>
     <l n="268">Then to another and another flew ,</l>
     <l n="269">To boast the wanton mischief he could do :</l>
     <l n="270">Yet she forgave him , though so great her pain ,</l>
     <l n="271">That she was never blithe or gay again .</l>
     <l n="272">Then came a spoiler , who , with villain-art</l>
     <l n="273">Implored her hand , and agonized her heart ;</l>
     <l n="274">He seized her purse , in idle waste to spend</l>
     <l n="275">With a vile wanton , whom she call 'd her friend ;</l>
     <l n="276">Five years she suffer 'd — he had revell 'd five -</l>
     <l n="277">Then came to show her he was just alive ;</l>
     <l n="278">Alone he came , his vile companion dead ,</l>
     <l n="279">And he , a wand'ring pauper , wanting bread ;</l>
     <l n="280">His body wasted , wither 'd life and limb ,</l>
     <l n="281">When this kind soul became a slave to him :</l>
     <l n="282">Nay , she was sure that , should he now survive ,</l>
     <l n="283">No better husband would be left alive :</l>
     <l n="284">For him she mourn 'd , and then , alone and poor ,</l>
     <l n="285">Sought and found comfort at her Lady 's door :</l>
     <l n="286">Ten years she served , and mercy her employ ,</l>
     <l n="287">Her tasks were pleasure , and her duty joy .</l>
     <l n="288">Thus lived the Mistress and the Maid , design 'd</l>
     <l n="289">Each other 's aid — one cautious , and both kind :</l>
     <l n="290">Oft at their window , working , they would sigh</l>
     <l n="291">To see the aged and the sick go by ;</l>
     <l n="292">Like wounded bees , that at their home arrive</l>
     <l n="293">Slowly and weak , but labouring for the hive .</l>
     <l n="294">The busy people of a mason 's yard</l>
     <l n="295">The curious Lady view 'd with much regard ;</l>
     <l n="296">With steady motion she perceived them draw</l>
     <l n="297">Through blocks of stone the slowly-working saw ;</l>
     <l n="298">It gave her pleasure and surprise to see</l>
     <l n="299">Among these men the signs of revelry :</l>
     <l n="300">Cold was the season , and confined their view ,</l>
     <l n="301">Tedious their tasks , but merry were the crew ;</l>
     <l n="302">There she beheld an aged pauper wait ,</l>
     <l n="303">Patient and still , to take an humble freight ;</l>
     <l n="304">Within the panniers on an ass he laid</l>
     <l n="305">The ponderous grit , and for the portion paid ;</l>
     <l n="306">This he re-sold , and , with each trifling gift ,</l>
     <l n="307">Made shift to live , and wretched was the shift .</l>
     <l n="308">Now will it be by every reader told</l>
     <l n="309">Who was this humble trader , poor and old . -</l>
     <l n="310">In vain an author would a name suppress ,</l>
     <l n="311">From the least hint a reader learns to guess ;</l>
     <l n="312">Of children lost , our novels sometimes treat ,</l>
     <l n="313">We never care — assured again to meet :</l>
     <l n="314">In vain the writer for concealment tries ,</l>
     <l n="315">We trace his purpose under all disguise ;</l>
     <l n="316">Nay , though he tells us they are dead and gone ,</l>
     <l n="317">Of whom we wot , they will appear anon ;</l>
     <l n="318">Our favourites fight , are wounded , hopeless lie ,</l>
     <l n="319">Survive they cannot — nay , they cannot die ;</l>
     <l n="320">Now , as these tricks and stratagems are known ,</l>
     <l n="321">‘ Tis best , at once , the simple truth to own .</l>
     <l n="322">This was the husband — in an humble shed</l>
     <l n="323">He nightly slept , and daily sought his bread :</l>
     <l n="324">Once for relief the weary man applied ;</l>
     <l n="325">“ Your wife is rich , ” the angry vestry cried :</l>
     <l n="326">Alas ! he dared not to his wife complain ,</l>
     <l n="327">Feeling her wrongs , and fearing her disdain :</l>
     <l n="328">By various methods he had tried to live ,</l>
     <l n="329">But not one effort would subsistence give :</l>
     <l n="330">He was an usher in a school , till noise</l>
     <l n="331">Made him less able than the weaker boys ;</l>
     <l n="332">On messages he went , till he in vain</l>
     <l n="333">Strove names , or words , or meanings to retain ;</l>
     <l n="334">Each small employment in each neighbouring town ,</l>
     <l n="335">By turn he took , to lay as quickly down :</l>
     <l n="336">For , such his fate , he fail 'd in all he plann 'd ,</l>
     <l n="337">And nothing prosper 'd in his luckless hand .</l>
     <l n="338">At his old home , his motive half suppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="339">He sought no more for riches , but for rest :</l>
     <l n="340">There lived the bounteous Wife , and at her gate</l>
     <l n="341">He saw in cheerful groups the needy wait ;</l>
     <l n="342">“ Had he a right with bolder hope t'apply ? ”</l>
     <l n="343">He ask 'd — was answer 'd , and went groaning by :</l>
     <l n="344">For some remains of spirit , temper , pride ,</l>
     <l n="345">Forbade a prayer he knew would be denied .</l>
     <l n="346">Thus was the grieving man , with burthen 'd ass ,</l>
     <l n="347">Seen day by day along the street to pass :</l>
     <l n="348">“ Who is he , Susan ? who the poor old man ?</l>
     <l n="349">He never calls — do make him , if you can . ”</l>
     <l n="350">The conscious damsel still delay 'd to speak ,</l>
     <l n="351">She stopp 'd confused , and had her words to seek ;</l>
     <l n="352">From Susan 's fears the fact her mistress knew ,</l>
     <l n="353">And cried — “ The wretch ! what scheme has he in view ?</l>
     <l n="354">Is this his lot ?— but let him , let him feel -</l>
     <l n="355">Who wants the courage , not the will , to steal . ”</l>
     <l n="356">A dreadful winter came , each day severe ,</l>
     <l n="357">Misty when mild , and icy cold when clear ;</l>
     <l n="358">And still the humble dealer took his load ,</l>
     <l n="359">Returning slow , and shivering on the road :</l>
     <l n="360">The Lady , still relentless , saw him come ,</l>
     <l n="361">And said — “ I wonder , has the wretch a home ? ” -</l>
     <l n="362">“ A hut ! a hovel ! ” “ Then his fate appears</l>
     <l n="363">To suit his crime . ” — “ Yes , lady , not his years ; -</l>
     <l n="364">No ! nor his sufferings — nor that form decay 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="365">“ Well ! let the parish give its paupers aid :</l>
     <l n="366">You must the vileness of his acts allow . ” -</l>
     <l n="367">“ And you , dear lady , that he feels it now . ”</l>
     <l n="368">“ When such dissemblers on their deeds reflect ,</l>
     <l n="369">Can they the pity they refused expect ?</l>
     <l n="370">He that doth evil , evil shall he dread . ” -</l>
     <l n="371">“ The snow , ” quoth Susan , “ falls upon his bed -</l>
     <l n="372">It blows beside the thatch — it melts upon his head . ”</l>
     <l n="373">“ Tis weakness , child , for grieving guilt to feel . ” -</l>
     <l n="374">“ Yes , but he never sees a wholesome meal ;</l>
     <l n="375">Through his bare dress appears his shrivell 'd skin ,</l>
     <l n="376">And ill he fares without , and worse within :</l>
     <l n="377">With that weak body , lame , diseased , and slow ,</l>
     <l n="378">What cold , pain , peril , must the sufferer know ! ”</l>
     <l n="379">“ Think on his crime . ” — “ Yes , sure ‘ twas very wrong ;</l>
     <l n="380">But look ( God bless him ! ) how he gropes along . ”</l>
     <l n="381">“ Brought me to shame . ” — Oh ! yes , I know it all -</l>
     <l n="382">What cutting blast ! and he can scarcely crawl :</l>
     <l n="383">He freezes as he moves — he dies ! if he should fall :</l>
     <l n="384">With cruel fierceness drives this icy sleet -</l>
     <l n="385">And must a Christian perish in the street ,</l>
     <l n="386">In sight of Christians ?— There ! at last , he lies ; -</l>
     <l n="387">Nor unsupported can he ever rise :</l>
     <l n="388">He cannot live . ” “ But is he fit to die ? ” -</l>
     <l n="389">Here Susan softly mutter 'd a reply ,</l>
     <l n="390">Look 'd round the room — said something of its state ,</l>
     <l n="391">Dives the rich , and Lazarus at his gate ;</l>
     <l n="392">And then aloud — “ In pity do behold</l>
     <l n="393">The man affrighten 'd , weeping , trembling , cold :</l>
     <l n="394">Oh ! how those flakes of snow their entrance win</l>
     <l n="395">Through the poor rags , and keep the frost within .</l>
     <l n="396">His very heart seems frozen as he goes ,</l>
     <l n="397">Leading that starved companion of his woes :</l>
     <l n="398">He tried to pray — his lips , I saw them move ,</l>
     <l n="399">And he so turn 'd his piteous looks above ;</l>
     <l n="400">But the fierce wind the willing heart opposed ,</l>
     <l n="401">And , ere he spoke , the lips in misery closed :</l>
     <l n="402">Poor suffering object ! yes , for ease you pray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="403">And God will hear — He only , I 'm afraid . ”</l>
     <l n="404">“ Peace ! Susan , peace ! pain ever follows sin . ” -</l>
     <l n="405">“ Ah ! then , ” thought Susan , “ when will ours begin ?</l>
     <l n="406">When reach 'd his home , to what a cheerless fire</l>
     <l n="407">And chilling bed will those cold limbs retire !</l>
     <l n="408">Yet ragged , wretched as it is , that bed</l>
     <l n="409">Takes half the space of his contracted shed ;</l>
     <l n="410">I saw the thorns beside the narrow grate ,</l>
     <l n="411">With straw collected in a putrid state :</l>
     <l n="412">There will he , kneeling , strive the fire to raise ,</l>
     <l n="413">And that will warm him , rather than the blaze :</l>
     <l n="414">The sullen , smoky blaze , that cannot last</l>
     <l n="415">One moment after his attempt is past ;</l>
     <l n="416">And I so warmly and so purely laid ,</l>
     <l n="417">To sink to rest — indeed , I am afraid . ”</l>
     <l n="418">“ Know you his conduct ? ” — “ Yes , indeed I know ,</l>
     <l n="419">And how he wanders in the wind and snow ;</l>
     <l n="420">Safe in our rooms the threat'ning storm we hear ,</l>
     <l n="421">But he feels strongly what we faintly fear . ”</l>
     <l n="422">“ Wilful was rich , and he the storm defied ;</l>
     <l n="423">Wilful is poor , and must the storm abide , ”</l>
     <l n="424">Said the stern Lady ; “ ‘ tis in vain to feel ;</l>
     <l n="425">Go and prepare the chicken for our meal . ”</l>
     <l n="426">Susan her task reluctantly began ,</l>
     <l n="427">And utter 'd as she went — “ The poor old man ! ”</l>
     <l n="428">But while her soft and ever-yielding heart</l>
     <l n="429">Made strong protest against her lady 's part ,</l>
     <l n="430">The lady 's self began to think it wrong</l>
     <l n="431">To feel so wrathful and resent so long .</l>
     <l n="432">“ No more the wretch would she receive again ,</l>
     <l n="433">No more behold him — but she would sustain ;</l>
     <l n="434">Great his offence , and evil was his mind -</l>
     <l n="435">But he had suffer 'd , and she would be kind :</l>
     <l n="436">She spurn 'd such baseness , and she found within</l>
     <l n="437">A fair acquittal from so foul a sin ;</l>
     <l n="438">Yet she too err 'd , and must of Heaven expect</l>
     <l n="439">To be rejected , him should she reject . ”</l>
     <l n="440">Susan was summon 'd — “ I 'm about to do</l>
     <l n="441">A foolish act , in part seduced by you ;</l>
     <l n="442">Go to the creature — say that I intend ,</l>
     <l n="443">Foe to his sins , to be his sorrow 's friend :</l>
     <l n="444">Take , for his present comforts , food and wine ,</l>
     <l n="445">And mark his feelings at this act of mine :</l>
     <l n="446">Observe if shame be o'er his features spread ,</l>
     <l n="447">By his own victim to be soothed and fed ;</l>
     <l n="448">But , this inform him , that it is not love</l>
     <l n="449">That prompts my heart , that duties only move .</l>
     <l n="450">Say , that no merits in his favour plead ,</l>
     <l n="451">But miseries only , and his abject need ;</l>
     <l n="452">Nor bring me grov'ling thanks , nor high-flown praise ;</l>
     <l n="453">I would his spirits , not his fancy , raise :</l>
     <l n="454">Give him no hope that I shall ever more</l>
     <l n="455">A man so vile to my esteem restore ;</l>
     <l n="456">But warn him rather , that , in time of rest ,</l>
     <l n="457">His crimes be all remember 'd and confess 'd :</l>
     <l n="458">I know not all that form the sinner 's debt ,</l>
     <l n="459">But there is one that he must not forget . ”</l>
     <l n="460">The mind of Susan prompted her with speed</l>
     <l n="461">To act her part in every courteous deed :</l>
     <l n="462">All that was kind she was prepared to say ,</l>
     <l n="463">And keep the lecture for a future day ;</l>
     <l n="464">When he had all life 's comforts by his side ,</l>
     <l n="465">Pity might sleep , and good advice be tried .</l>
     <l n="466">This done , the mistress felt disposed to look ,</l>
     <l n="467">As self-approving , on a pious book ;</l>
     <l n="468">Yet , to her native bias still inclined ,</l>
     <l n="469">She felt her act too merciful and kind ;</l>
     <l n="470">But when , long musing on the chilling scene</l>
     <l n="471">So lately past — the frost and sleet so keen -</l>
     <l n="472">The man 's whole misery in a single view -</l>
     <l n="473">Yes ! she could think some pity was his due .</l>
     <l n="474">Thus fix 'd , she heard not her attendant glide</l>
     <l n="475">With soft slow step — till , standing by her side ,</l>
     <l n="476">The trembling servant gasp 'd for breath , and shed</l>
     <l n="477">Relieving tears , then utter 'd , “ He is dead ! ”</l>
     <l n="478">“ Dead ! ” said the startled Lady .— “ Yes , he fell</l>
     <l n="479">Close at the door where he was wont to dwell ;</l>
     <l n="480">There his sole friend , the Ass , was standing by ,</l>
     <l n="481">Half dead himself , to see his Master die . ”</l>
     <l n="482">“ Expired he then , good Heaven ! for want of food ? ” -</l>
     <l n="483">“ No ! crusts and water in a corner stood : -</l>
     <l n="484">To have this plenty , and to wait so long ,</l>
     <l n="485">And to be right too late , is doubly wrong :</l>
     <l n="486">Then , every day to see him totter by ,</l>
     <l n="487">And to forbear — Oh ! what a heart had I ! ”</l>
     <l n="488">“ Blame me not , child ; I tremble at the news . ”</l>
     <l n="489">“ Tis my own heart , ” said Susan , “ I accuse :</l>
     <l n="490">To have this money in my purse — to know</l>
     <l n="491">What grief was his , and what to grief we owe ;</l>
     <l n="492">To see him often , always to conceive</l>
     <l n="493">How he must pine and languish , groan and grieve ,</l>
     <l n="494">And every day in ease and peace to dine ,</l>
     <l n="495">And rest in comfort !— What a heart is mine ! ”</l>

     <l n="10">Counter and Clubb were men in trade , whose pains ,</l>
     <l n="11">Credit , and prudence , brought them constant gains ;</l>
     <l n="12">Partners and punctual , every friend agreed</l>
     <l n="13">Counter and Clubb were men who must succeed .</l>
     <l n="14">When they had fix 'd some little time in life ,</l>
     <l n="15">Each thought of taking to himself a wife :</l>
     <l n="16">As men in trade alike , as men in love ,</l>
     <l n="17">They seem 'd with no according views to move ;</l>
     <l n="18">As certain ores in outward view the same ,</l>
     <l n="19">They show 'd their difference when the magnet came .</l>
     <l n="20">Counter was vain : with spirit strong and high ,</l>
     <l n="21">‘ Twas not in him like suppliant swain to sigh :</l>
     <l n="22">“ His wife might o'er his men and maids preside ,</l>
     <l n="23">And in her province be a judge and guide ;</l>
     <l n="24">But what he thought , or did , or wish 'd to do ,</l>
     <l n="25">She must not know , or censure if she knew ;</l>
     <l n="26">At home , abroad , by day , by night , if he</l>
     <l n="27">On aught determined , so it was to be :</l>
     <l n="28">How is a man , ” he ask 'd , “ for business fit ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who to a female can his will submit ?</l>
     <l n="30">Absent a while , let no inquiring eye</l>
     <l n="31">Or plainer speech presume to question why :</l>
     <l n="32">But all be silent ; and , when seen again ,</l>
     <l n="33">Let all be cheerful — shall a wife complain ?</l>
     <l n="34">Friends I invite , and who shall dare t'object ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or look on them with coolness or neglect ?</l>
     <l n="36">No ! I must ever of my house be head ,</l>
     <l n="37">And , thus obey 'd , I condescend to wed . ”</l>
     <l n="38">Clubb heard the speech — “ My friend is nice , said he ;</l>
     <l n="39">A wife with less respect will do for me :</l>
     <l n="40">How is he certain such a prize to gain ?</l>
     <l n="41">What he approves , a lass may learn to feign ,</l>
     <l n="42">And so affect t'obey till she begins to reign ;</l>
     <l n="43">A while complying , she may vary then ,</l>
     <l n="44">And be as wives of more unwary men ;</l>
     <l n="45">Beside , to him who plays such lordly part ,</l>
     <l n="46">How shall a tender creature yield her heart ;</l>
     <l n="47">Should he the promised confidence refuse ,</l>
     <l n="48">She may another more confiding choose ;</l>
     <l n="49">May show her anger , yet her purpose hide ,</l>
     <l n="50">And wake his jealousy , and wound his pride .</l>
     <l n="51">In one so humbled , who can trace the friend ?</l>
     <l n="52">I on an equal , not a slave , depend ;</l>
     <l n="53">If true , my confidence is wisely placed ,</l>
     <l n="54">And being false , she only is disgraced . ”</l>
     <l n="55">Clubb , with these notions , cast his eye around ;</l>
     <l n="56">And one so easy soon a partner found .</l>
     <l n="57">The lady chosen was of good repute ;</l>
     <l n="58">Meekness she had not , and was seldom mute ;</l>
     <l n="59">Though quick to anger , still she loved to smile ,</l>
     <l n="60">And would be calm if men would wait a while :</l>
     <l n="61">She knew her duty , and she loved her way ,</l>
     <l n="62">More pleased in truth to govern than obey ;</l>
     <l n="63">She heard her priest with reverence , and her spouse</l>
     <l n="64">As one who felt the pressure of her vows ;</l>
     <l n="65">Useful and civil , all her friends confess 'd -</l>
     <l n="66">Give her her way , and she would choose the best ;</l>
     <l n="67">Though some indeed a sly remark would make -</l>
     <l n="68">Give it her not , and she would choose to take .</l>
     <l n="69">All this , when Clubb some cheerful months had spent ,</l>
     <l n="70">He saw , confess 'd , and said he was content .</l>
     <l n="71">Counter meantime selected , doubted , weigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="72">And then brought home a young complying maid ;</l>
     <l n="73">A tender creature , full of fears as charms ,</l>
     <l n="74">A beauteous nursling from its mother 's arms ;</l>
     <l n="75">A soft , sweet blossom , such as men must love ,</l>
     <l n="76">But to preserve must keep it in the stove :</l>
     <l n="77">She had a mild , subdued , expiring look -</l>
     <l n="78">Raise but the voice , and this fair creature shook ;</l>
     <l n="79">Leave her alone , she felt a thousand fears -</l>
     <l n="80">Chide , and she melted into floods of tears ;</l>
     <l n="81">Fondly she pleaded , and would gently sigh ,</l>
     <l n="82">For very pity , or she knew not why ;</l>
     <l n="83">One whom to govern none could be afraid -</l>
     <l n="84">Hold up the finger , this meek thing obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="85">Her happy husband had the easiest task -</l>
     <l n="86">Say but his will , no question would she ask ;</l>
     <l n="87">She sought no reasons , no affairs she knew ,</l>
     <l n="88">Of business spoke not , and had nought to do .</l>
     <l n="89">Oft he exclaim 'd , “ How meek ! how mild ! how kind !</l>
     <l n="90">With her ‘ twere cruel but to seem unkind ;</l>
     <l n="91">Though ever silent when I take my leave ,</l>
     <l n="92">It pains my heart to think how hers will grieve ;</l>
     <l n="93">‘ Tis heaven on earth with such a wife to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="94">I am in raptures to have sped so well ;</l>
     <l n="95">But let me not , my friend , your envy raise ,</l>
     <l n="96">No ! on my life , your patience has my praise . ”</l>
     <l n="97">His Friend , though silent , felt the scorn implied -</l>
     <l n="98">“ What need of patience ? ” to himself he cried :</l>
     <l n="99">“ Better a woman o'er her house to rule ,</l>
     <l n="100">Than a poor child just hurried from her school ;</l>
     <l n="101">Who has no care , yet never lives at ease ;</l>
     <l n="102">Unfit to rule , and indisposed to please .</l>
     <l n="103">What if he govern , there his boast should end ;</l>
     <l n="104">No husband 's power can make a slave his friend . ”</l>
     <l n="105">It was the custom of these Friends to meet</l>
     <l n="106">With a few neighbours in a neighbouring street ;</l>
     <l n="107">Where Counter ofttimes would occasion seize</l>
     <l n="108">To move his silent Friend by words like these :</l>
     <l n="109">“ A man , ” said he , “ if govern 'd by his wife ,</l>
     <l n="110">Gives up his rank and dignity in life ;</l>
     <l n="111">Now , better fate befalls my Friend and me . ” -</l>
     <l n="112">He spoke , and look 'd th ’ approving smile to see .</l>
     <l n="113">The quiet partner , when he chose to speak ,</l>
     <l n="114">Desired his friend “ another theme to seek ;</l>
     <l n="115">When thus they met , he judged that state-affairs</l>
     <l n="116">And such important subjects should be theirs : ”</l>
     <l n="117">But still the partner , in his lighter vein ,</l>
     <l n="118">Would cause in Clubb affliction or disdain ;</l>
     <l n="119">It made him anxious to detect the cause</l>
     <l n="120">Of all that boasting : — “ Wants my friend applause ?</l>
     <l n="121">This plainly proves him not at perfect ease ,</l>
     <l n="122">For , felt he pleasure , he would wish to please .</l>
     <l n="123">These triumphs here for some regrets atone -</l>
     <l n="124">Men who are bless 'd let other men alone . ”</l>
     <l n="125">Thus made suspicious , he observed and saw</l>
     <l n="126">His friend each night at early hour withdraw ;</l>
     <l n="127">He sometimes mention 'd Juliet 's tender nerves ,</l>
     <l n="128">And what attention such a wife deserves :</l>
     <l n="129">“ In this , ” thought Clubb , “ full sure some mystery lies -</l>
     <l n="130">He laughs at me , yet he with much complies ,</l>
     <l n="131">And all his vaunts of bliss are proud apologies . ”</l>
     <l n="132">With such ideas treasured in his breast ,</l>
     <l n="133">He grew composed , and let his anger rest ;</l>
     <l n="134">Till Counter once ( when wine so long went round ,</l>
     <l n="135">That friendship and discretion both were drown 'd )</l>
     <l n="136">Began , in teasing and triumphant mood ,</l>
     <l n="137">His evening banter : — “ Of all earthly good ,</l>
     <l n="138">The best , ” he said , “ was an obedient spouse ,</l>
     <l n="139">Such as my friend 's — that every one allows :</l>
     <l n="140">What if she wishes his designs to know ?</l>
     <l n="141">It is because she would her praise bestow ;</l>
     <l n="142">What if she wills that he remain at home ?</l>
     <l n="143">She knows that mischief may from travel come .</l>
     <l n="144">I , who am free to venture where I please ,</l>
     <l n="145">Have no such kind preventing checks as these ;</l>
     <l n="146">But mine is double duty , first to guide</l>
     <l n="147">Myself aright , then rule a house beside ;</l>
     <l n="148">While this our friend , more happy than the free ,</l>
     <l n="149">Resigns all power , and laughs at liberty . ”</l>
     <l n="150">“ By heaven ! ” said Clubb , “ excuse me if I swear ,</l>
     <l n="151">I 'll bet a hundred guineas , if he dare ,</l>
     <l n="152">That uncontroll 'd I will such freedoms take</l>
     <l n="153">That he will fear to equal — there 's my stake . ”</l>
     <l n="154">“ A match ! ” said Counter , much by wine inflamed ;</l>
     <l n="155">“ But we are friends — let smaller stake be named :</l>
     <l n="156">Wine for our future meeting , that will I</l>
     <l n="157">Take and no more — what peril shall we try ? ”</l>
     <l n="158">“ Let 's to Newmarket , ” Clubb replied ; “ or choose</l>
     <l n="159">Yourself the place , and what you like to lose :</l>
     <l n="160">And he who first returns , or fears to go ,</l>
     <l n="161">Forfeits his cash . ” — Said Counter , “ Be it so . ”</l>
     <l n="162">The friends around them saw with much delight</l>
     <l n="163">The social war , and hail 'd the pleasant night ;</l>
     <l n="164">Nor would they further hear the cause discuss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="165">Afraid the recreant heart of Clubb to trust .</l>
     <l n="166">Now sober thoughts return 'd as each withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="167">And of the subject took a serious view :</l>
     <l n="168">“ ‘ Twas wrong , ” thought Counter , “ and will grieve my love ; ”</l>
     <l n="169">“ ‘ Twas wrong , ” thought Clubb , “ my wife will not approve :</l>
     <l n="170">But friends were present ; I must try the thing ,</l>
     <l n="171">Or with my folly half the town will ring . ”</l>
     <l n="172">He sought his lady — “ Madam , I 'm to blame ,</l>
     <l n="173">But was reproach 'd , and could not bear the shame ;</l>
     <l n="174">Here in my folly — for ‘ tis best to say</l>
     <l n="175">The very truth — I 've sworn to have my way ;</l>
     <l n="176">To that Newmarket — ( though I hate the place ,</l>
     <l n="177">And have no taste or talents for a race ,</l>
     <l n="178">Yet so it is — well , now prepare to chide ) -</l>
     <l n="179">I laid a wager that I dared to ride :</l>
     <l n="180">And I must go : by heaven , if you resist</l>
     <l n="181">I shall be scorn 'd , and ridiculed , and hiss 'd ;</l>
     <l n="182">Let me with grace before my friends appear ,</l>
     <l n="183">You know the truth , and must not be severe :</l>
     <l n="184">He too must go , but that he will of course :</l>
     <l n="185">Do you consent ?— I never think of force . ”</l>
     <l n="186">“ You never need , ” the worthy Dame replied ;</l>
     <l n="187">“ The husband 's honour is the woman 's pride :</l>
     <l n="188">If I in trifles be the wilful wife ,</l>
     <l n="189">Still for your credit I would lose my life .</l>
     <l n="190">Go ! and when fix 'd the day of your return ,</l>
     <l n="191">Stay longer yet , and let the blockheads learn</l>
     <l n="192">That though a wife may sometimes wish to rule ,</l>
     <l n="193">She would not make th ’ indulgent man a fool ;</l>
     <l n="194">I would at times advise — but idle they</l>
     <l n="195">Who think th ’ assenting husband must obey . ”</l>
     <l n="196">The happy man , who thought his lady right</l>
     <l n="197">In other cases , was assured to-night ;</l>
     <l n="198">Then for the day with proud delight prepared ,</l>
     <l n="199">To show his doubting friends how much he dared .</l>
     <l n="200">Counter — who grieving sought his bed , his rest</l>
     <l n="201">Broken by pictures of his love distress 'd -</l>
     <l n="202">With soft and winning speech the fair prepared :</l>
     <l n="203">“ She all his councils , comforts , pleasures shared :</l>
     <l n="204">She was assured he loved her from his soul ,</l>
     <l n="205">She never knew and need not fear control ;</l>
     <l n="206">But so it happen 'd — he was grieved at heart</l>
     <l n="207">It happen 'd so , that they awhile must part</l>
     <l n="208">A little time — the distance was but short ,</l>
     <l n="209">And business called him — he despised the sport ;</l>
     <l n="210">But to Newmarket he engaged to ride</l>
     <l n="211">With his friend Clubb : ” and there he stopp 'd and sigh 'd .</l>
     <l n="212">Awhile the tender creature look 'd dismay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="213">Then floods of tears the call of grief obeyed : -</l>
     <l n="214">“ She an objection ! No ! ” she sobb 'd , “ not one :</l>
     <l n="215">Her work was finish 'd , and her race was run ;</l>
     <l n="216">For die she must — indeed she would not live</l>
     <l n="217">A week alone , for all the world could give ;</l>
     <l n="218">He too must die in that same wicked place ;</l>
     <l n="219">It always happen 'd — was a common case ;</l>
     <l n="220">Among those horrid horses , jockeys , crowds ,</l>
     <l n="221">‘ Twas certain death — they might bespeak their shrouds .</l>
     <l n="222">He would attempt a race , be sure to fall -</l>
     <l n="223">And she expire with terror — that was all ;</l>
     <l n="224">With love like hers she was indeed unfit</l>
     <l n="225">To bear such horrors , but she must submit . ”</l>
     <l n="226">“ But for three days , my love ! three days at most , ”</l>
     <l n="227">“ Enough for me ; I then shall be a ghost . ”</l>
     <l n="228">“ My honour 's pledged ! ” — “ Oh ! yes , my dearest life ,</l>
     <l n="229">I know your honour must outweigh your wife ;</l>
     <l n="230">But ere this absence have you sought a friend ?</l>
     <l n="231">I shall be dead — on whom can you depend ?</l>
     <l n="232">Let me one favour of your kindness crave ,</l>
     <l n="233">Grant me the stone I mention 'd for my grave . ”</l>
     <l n="234">“ Nay , love , attend — why , bless my soul ! I say</l>
     <l n="235">I will return — there , weep no longer , nay ! ”</l>
     <l n="236">“ Well ! I obey , and to the last am true ,</l>
     <l n="237">But spirits fail me ; I must die ; adieu ! ”</l>
     <l n="238">“ What , Madam ! must ?— ‘ tis wrong — I 'm angry — zounds</l>
     <l n="239">Can I remain and lose a thousand pounds ? ”</l>
     <l n="240">“ Go then , my love ! it is a monstrous sum ,</l>
     <l n="241">Worth twenty wives — go , love ! and I am dumb ;</l>
     <l n="242">Nor be displeased — had I the power to live ,</l>
     <l n="243">You might be angry , now you must forgive :</l>
     <l n="244">Alas ! I faint — ah ! cruel — there 's no need</l>
     <l n="245">Of wounds or fevers — this has done the deed . ”</l>
     <l n="246">The lady fainted , and the husband sent</l>
     <l n="247">For every aid — for every comfort went ;</l>
     <l n="248">Strong terror seized him : “ Oh ! she loved so well ,</l>
     <l n="249">And who th ’ effect of tenderness could tell ? ”</l>
     <l n="250">She now recover 'd , and again began</l>
     <l n="251">With accent querulous — “ Ah ! cruel man ! ”</l>
     <l n="252">Till the sad husband , conscience-struck , confess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="253">‘ Twas very wicked with his friend to jest ;</l>
     <l n="254">For now he saw that those who were obey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="255">Could like the most subservient feel afraid :</l>
     <l n="256">And though a wife might not dispute the will</l>
     <l n="257">Of her liege lord , she could prevent it still .</l>
     <l n="258">The morning came , and Clubb prepared to ride</l>
     <l n="259">With a smart boy , his servant , and his guide ;</l>
     <l n="260">When , ere he mounted on his ready steed ,</l>
     <l n="261">Arrived a letter , and he stopped to read .</l>
     <l n="262">“ My friend , ” he read , “ our journey I decline ,</l>
     <l n="263">A heart too tender for such strife is mine ;</l>
     <l n="264">Yours is the triumph , be you so inclined ;</l>
     <l n="265">But you are too considerate and kind :</l>
     <l n="266">In tender pity to my Juliet 's fears</l>
     <l n="267">I thus relent , o'ercome by love and tears ;</l>
     <l n="268">She knows your kindness ; I have heard her say ,</l>
     <l n="269">A man like you ‘ tis pleasure to obey :</l>
     <l n="270">Each faithful wife , like ours , must disapprove</l>
     <l n="271">Such dangerous trifling with connubial love ;</l>
     <l n="272">What has the idle world , my friend , to do</l>
     <l n="273">With our affairs ? they envy me and you :</l>
     <l n="274">What if I could my gentle spouse command -</l>
     <l n="275">Is that a cause I should her tears withstand ?</l>
     <l n="276">And what if you , a friend of peace , submit</l>
     <l n="277">To one you love — is that a theme for wit ?</l>
     <l n="278">‘ Twas wrong , and I shall henceforth judge it weak</l>
     <l n="279">Both of submission and control to speak :</l>
     <l n="280">Be it agreed that all contention cease ,</l>
     <l n="281">And no such follies vex our future peace ;</l>
     <l n="282">Let each keep guard against domestic strife ,</l>
     <l n="283">And find nor slave nor tyrant in his wife . ”</l>
     <l n="284">“ Agreed , ” said Clubb , “ with all my soul agreed ; ” -</l>
     <l n="285">And to the boy , delighted , gave his steed .</l>
     <l n="286">“ I think my friend has well his mind express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="287">And I assent ; such things are not a jest . ”</l>
     <l n="288">“ True , ” said the Wife , “ no longer he can hide</l>
     <l n="289">The truth that pains him by his wounded pride :</l>
     <l n="290">Your friend has found it not an easy thing ,</l>
     <l n="291">Beneath his yoke this yielding soul to bring :</l>
     <l n="292">These weeping willows , though they seem inclined</l>
     <l n="293">By every breeze , yet not the strongest wind</l>
     <l n="294">Can from their bent divert this weak but stubborn kind ;</l>
     <l n="295">Drooping they seek your pity to excite ,</l>
     <l n="296">But ‘ tis at once their nature and delight ;</l>
     <l n="297">Such women feel not ; while they sigh and weep ,</l>
     <l n="298">‘ Tis but their habit — their affections sleep ;</l>
     <l n="299">They are like ice that in the hand we hold ,</l>
     <l n="300">So very melting , yet so very cold ;</l>
     <l n="301">On such affection let not man rely ,</l>
     <l n="302">The husbands suffer , and the ladies sigh :</l>
     <l n="303">But your friend 's offer let us kindly take ,</l>
     <l n="304">And spare his pride for his vexation 's sake ;</l>
     <l n="305">For he has found , and through his life will find ,</l>
     <l n="306">‘ Tis easiest dealing with the firmest mind -</l>
     <l n="307">More just when it resists , and , when it yields , more kind . ”</l>

     <l n="11">Some to our Hero have a hero 's name</l>
     <l n="12">Denied , because no father 's he could claim ;</l>
     <l n="13">Nor could his mother with precision state</l>
     <l n="14">A full fair claim to her certificate ;</l>
     <l n="15">On her own word the marriage must depend -</l>
     <l n="16">A point she was not eager to defend :</l>
     <l n="17">But who , without a father 's name , can raise</l>
     <l n="18">His own so high , deserves the greater praise ;</l>
     <l n="19">The less advantage to the strife he brought ,</l>
     <l n="20">The greater wonders has his prowess wrought ;</l>
     <l n="21">He who depends upon his wind and limbs ,</l>
     <l n="22">Needs neither cork nor bladder when he swims ;</l>
     <l n="23">Nor will by empty breath be puff 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="24">As not himself — but in his helpers — strong .</l>
     <l n="25">Suffice it then , our Hero 's name was clear ,</l>
     <l n="26">For call John Dighton , and he answer 'd “ Here ! ”</l>
     <l n="27">But who that name in early life assign 'd</l>
     <l n="28">He never found , he never tried to find :</l>
     <l n="29">Whether his kindred were to John disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or John to them , is a disputed case ;</l>
     <l n="31">His infant state owed nothing to their care -</l>
     <l n="32">His mind neglected , and his body bare ;</l>
     <l n="33">All his success must on himself depend ,</l>
     <l n="34">He had no money , counsel , guide , or friend ;</l>
     <l n="35">But in a market-town an active boy</l>
     <l n="36">Appear 'd , and sought in various ways employ ;</l>
     <l n="37">Who soon , thus cast upon the world , began</l>
     <l n="38">To show the talents of a thriving man .</l>
     <l n="39">With spirit high John learn 'd the world to brave ,</l>
     <l n="40">And in both senses was a ready knave ;</l>
     <l n="41">Knave as of old obedient , keen , and quick ,</l>
     <l n="42">Knave as of present , skill 'd to shift and trick ;</l>
     <l n="43">Some humble part of many trades he caught ,</l>
     <l n="44">He for the builder and the painter wrought ;</l>
     <l n="45">For serving-maids on secret errands ran ,</l>
     <l n="46">The waiter 's helper , and the ostler 's man ;</l>
     <l n="47">And when he chanced ( oft chanced he ) place to lose ,</l>
     <l n="48">His varying genius shone in blacking shoes :</l>
     <l n="49">A midnight fisher by the pond he stood ,</l>
     <l n="50">Assistant poacher , he o'erlook ' d the wood ;</l>
     <l n="51">At an election John 's impartial mind</l>
     <l n="52">Was to no cause nor candidate confined ;</l>
     <l n="53">To all in turn he full allegiance swore ,</l>
     <l n="54">And in his hat the various badges bore :</l>
     <l n="55">His liberal soul with every sect agreed ,</l>
     <l n="56">Unheard their reasons , he received their creed :</l>
     <l n="57">At church he deign 'd the organ-pipes to fill ,</l>
     <l n="58">And at the meeting sang both loud and shrill :</l>
     <l n="59">But the full purse these different merits gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="60">By strong demands his lively passions drain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="61">Liquors he loved of each inflaming kind ,</l>
     <l n="62">To midnight revels flew with ardent mind ;</l>
     <l n="63">Too warm at cards , a losing game he play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">To fleecing beauty his attention paid ;</l>
     <l n="65">His boiling passions were by oaths express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="66">And lies he made his profit and his jest .</l>
     <l n="67">Such was the boy , and such the man had been ,</l>
     <l n="68">But fate or happier fortune changed the scene ;</l>
     <l n="69">A fever seized him , “ He should surely die — ”</l>
     <l n="70">He fear 'd , and lo ! a friend was praying by ;</l>
     <l n="71">With terror moved , this Teacher he address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="72">And all the errors of his youth confess 'd :</l>
     <l n="73">The good man kindly clear 'd the Sinner 's way</l>
     <l n="74">To lively hope , and counsell 'd him to pray ;</l>
     <l n="75">Who then resolved , should he from sickness rise ,</l>
     <l n="76">To quit cards , liquors , poaching , oaths , and lies ;</l>
     <l n="77">His health restored , he yet resolved and grew</l>
     <l n="78">True to his masters , to their Meeting true ;</l>
     <l n="79">His old companions at his sober face</l>
     <l n="80">Laugh 'd loud , while he , attesting it was grace ,</l>
     <l n="81">With tears besought them all his calling to embrace :</l>
     <l n="82">To his new friends such convert gave applause ,</l>
     <l n="83">Life to their zeal , and glory to their cause :</l>
     <l n="84">Though terror wrought the mighty change , yet strong</l>
     <l n="85">Was the impression , and it lasted long ;</l>
     <l n="86">John at the lectures due attendance paid ,</l>
     <l n="87">A convert meek , obedient , and afraid ;</l>
     <l n="88">His manners strict , though form 'd on fear alone ,</l>
     <l n="89">Pleased the grave friends , nor less his solemn tone ,</l>
     <l n="90">The lengthen 'd face of care , the low and inward groan ;</l>
     <l n="91">The stern good men exulted when they saw</l>
     <l n="92">Those timid looks of penitence and awe ;</l>
     <l n="93">Nor thought that one so passive , humble , meek ,</l>
     <l n="94">Had yet a creed and principles to seek .</l>
     <l n="95">The Faith that Reason finds , confirms , avows ,</l>
     <l n="96">The hopes , the views , the comforts she allows -</l>
     <l n="97">These were not his , who by his feelings found ,</l>
     <l n="98">And by them only , that his faith was sound ;</l>
     <l n="99">Feelings of terror these , for evil past ,</l>
     <l n="100">Feelings of hope to be received at last ;</l>
     <l n="101">Now weak , now lively , changing with the day -</l>
     <l n="102">These were his feelings , and he felt his way .</l>
     <l n="103">Sprung from such sources , will this faith remain</l>
     <l n="104">While these supporters can their strength retain ?</l>
     <l n="105">As heaviest weights the deepest rivers pass ,</l>
     <l n="106">While icy chains fast bind the solid mass ;</l>
     <l n="107">So , born of feelings , faith remains secure ,</l>
     <l n="108">Long as their firmness and their strength endure ;</l>
     <l n="109">But when the waters in their channel glide ,</l>
     <l n="110">A bridge must bear us o'er the threat'ning tide ;</l>
     <l n="111">Such bridge is Reason , and there Faith relies ,</l>
     <l n="112">Whether the varying spirits fall or rise .</l>
     <l n="113">His patrons , still disposed their aid to lend .</l>
     <l n="114">Behind a counter placed their humble friend ,</l>
     <l n="115">Where pens and paper were on shelves display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="116">And pious pamphlets on the windows laid :</l>
     <l n="117">By nature active , and from vice restrain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="118">Increasing trade his bolder views sustain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="119">His friends and teachers , finding so much zeal</l>
     <l n="120">In that young convert whom they taught to feel ,</l>
     <l n="121">His trade encouraged , and were pleased to find</l>
     <l n="122">A hand so ready , with such humble mind .</l>
     <l n="123">And now , his health restored , his spirits eased ,</l>
     <l n="124">He wish 'd to marry , if the teachers pleased .</l>
     <l n="125">They , not unwilling , from the virgin-class</l>
     <l n="126">Took him a comely and a courteous lass ;</l>
     <l n="127">Simple and civil , loving and beloved ,</l>
     <l n="128">She long a fond and faithful partner proved ;</l>
     <l n="129">In every year the elders and the priest</l>
     <l n="130">Were duly summon 'd to a christening feast ;</l>
     <l n="131">Nor came a babe , but by his growing trade</l>
     <l n="132">John had provision for the coming made ;</l>
     <l n="133">For friends and strangers all were pleased to deal</l>
     <l n="134">With one whose care was equal to his zeal .</l>
     <l n="135">In human friendships , it compels a sigh</l>
     <l n="136">To think what trifles will dissolve the tie .</l>
     <l n="137">John , now become a master of his trade ,</l>
     <l n="138">Perceived how much improvement might be made ;</l>
     <l n="139">And as this prospect open 'd to his view ,</l>
     <l n="140">A certain portion of his zeal withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="141">His fear abated — “ What had he to fear -</l>
     <l n="142">His profits certain , and his conscience clear ? ”</l>
     <l n="143">Above his door a board was placed by John ,</l>
     <l n="144">And “ Dighton , Stationer , ” was gilt thereon ;</l>
     <l n="145">His window next , enlarged to twice the size ,</l>
     <l n="146">Shone with such trinkets as the simple prize ;</l>
     <l n="147">While in the shop with pious works were seen</l>
     <l n="148">The last new play , review , or magazine :</l>
     <l n="149">In orders punctual , he observed — “ The books</l>
     <l n="150">He never read , and could he judge their looks ?</l>
     <l n="151">Readers and critics should their merits try ,</l>
     <l n="152">He had no office but to sell and buy ;</l>
     <l n="153">Like other traders , profit was his care ;</l>
     <l n="154">Of what they print , the authors must beware . ”</l>
     <l n="155">He held his patrons and his teachers dear ,</l>
     <l n="156">But with his trade they must not interfere .</l>
     <l n="157">‘ Twas certain now that John had lost the dread</l>
     <l n="158">And pious thoughts that once such terrors bred ;</l>
     <l n="159">His habits varied , and he more inclined</l>
     <l n="160">To the vain world , which he had half resign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="161">He had moreover in his brethren seen ,</l>
     <l n="162">Or he imagined , craft , conceit , and spleen :</l>
     <l n="163">“ They are but men , ” said John , “ and shall I then</l>
     <l n="164">Fear man 's control , or stand in awe of men ?</l>
     <l n="165">‘ Tis their advice ( their Convert 's rule and law ) ,</l>
     <l n="166">And good it is — I will not stand in awe . ”</l>
     <l n="167">Moreover Dighton , though he thought of books</l>
     <l n="168">As one who chiefly on the title looks ,</l>
     <l n="169">Yet sometimes ponder 'd o'er a page to find ,</l>
     <l n="170">When vex 'd with cares , amusement for his mind ;</l>
     <l n="171">And by degrees that mind had treasured much</l>
     <l n="172">From works his teachers were afraid to touch :</l>
     <l n="173">Satiric novels , poets bold and free ,</l>
     <l n="174">And what their writers term philosophy ;</l>
     <l n="175">All these were read , and he began to feel</l>
     <l n="176">Some self-approval on his bosom steal .</l>
     <l n="177">Wisdom creates humility , but he</l>
     <l n="178">Who thus collects it will not humble be :</l>
     <l n="179">No longer John was fill 'd with pure delight</l>
     <l n="180">And humble reverence in a pastor 's sight ;</l>
     <l n="181">Who , like a grateful zealot , listening stood ,</l>
     <l n="182">To hear a man so friendly and so good ;</l>
     <l n="183">But felt the dignity of one who made</l>
     <l n="184">Himself important by a thriving trade :</l>
     <l n="185">And growing pride in Dighton 's mind was bred</l>
     <l n="186">By the strange food on which it coarsely fed .</l>
     <l n="187">Their Brother 's fall the grieving Brethren heard -</l>
     <l n="188">His pride indeed to all around appeared ;</l>
     <l n="189">The world , his friends agreed , had won the soul</l>
     <l n="190">From its best hopes , the man from their control .</l>
     <l n="191">To make him humble , and confine his views</l>
     <l n="192">Within their bounds , and books which they peruse ,</l>
     <l n="193">A deputation from these friends select</l>
     <l n="194">Might reason with him to some good effect ;</l>
     <l n="195">Arm 'd with authority , and led by love ,</l>
     <l n="196">They might those follies from his mind remove .</l>
     <l n="197">Deciding thus , and with this kind intent ,</l>
     <l n="198">A chosen body with its speaker went .</l>
     <l n="199">“ John , ” said the Teacher , “ John , with great concern .</l>
     <l n="200">We see thy frailty , and thy fate discern -</l>
     <l n="201">Satan with toils thy simple soul beset ,</l>
     <l n="202">And thou art careless slumbering in the net :</l>
     <l n="203">Unmindful art thou of thy early vow ;</l>
     <l n="204">Who at the morning meeting sees thee now ?</l>
     <l n="205">Who at the evening ? ‘ Where is brother John ? ’</l>
     <l n="206">We ask ;— are answer 'd , ‘ To the tavern gone . ’</l>
     <l n="207">Thee on the Sabbath seldom we behold ;</l>
     <l n="208">Thou canst not sing , thou'rt nursing for a cold :</l>
     <l n="209">This from the churchmen thou hast learn 'd , for they</l>
     <l n="210">Have colds and fevers on the Sabbath-day ;</l>
     <l n="211">When in some snug warm room they sit , and pen</l>
     <l n="212">Bills from their ledgers — world-entangled men ,</l>
     <l n="213">“ See with what pride thou hast enlarged thy shop ;</l>
     <l n="214">To view thy tempting stores the heedless stop .</l>
     <l n="215">By what strange names dost thou these baubles know ,</l>
     <l n="216">Which wantons wear , to make a sinful show ?</l>
     <l n="217">Hast thou in view these idle volumes placed</l>
     <l n="218">To be the pander of a vicious taste ?</l>
     <l n="219">What 's here ? a book of dances !— you advance</l>
     <l n="220">In goodly knowledge — John , wilt learn to dance ?</l>
     <l n="221">How ! ‘ Go , ’ it says , and ‘ to the devil go !</l>
     <l n="222">And shake thyself ! ’ I tremble — but ‘ tis so ;</l>
     <l n="223">Wretch as thou art , what answer canst thou make ?</l>
     <l n="224">Oh ! without question , thou wilt go and shake .</l>
     <l n="225">What 's here ? ‘ The School for Scandal ’ — pretty schools !</l>
     <l n="226">Well , and art thou proficient in the rules ?</l>
     <l n="227">Art thou a pupil ? Is it thy design</l>
     <l n="228">To make our names contemptible as thine ?</l>

     <l n="230">A fool has courage when he laughs at hell ;</l>
     <l n="231">‘ Frolic and Fun ; ’ the Humours of Tim Grin ; ’</l>
     <l n="232">Why , John , thou grow'st facetious in thy sin ;</l>
     <l n="233">And what ?— ‘ The Archdeacon 's Charge ! ’ — ‘ tis mighty well -</l>
     <l n="234">If Satan publish 'd , thou wouldst doubtless sell :</l>
     <l n="235">Jests , novels , dances , and this precious stuff</l>
     <l n="236">To crown thy folly — we have seen enough ;</l>
     <l n="237">We find thee fitted for each evil work :</l>
     <l n="238">Do print the Koran and become a Turk .</l>
     <l n="239">“ John , thou art lost ; success and worldly pride</l>
     <l n="240">O'er all thy thoughts and purposes preside ,</l>
     <l n="241">Have bound thee fast , and drawn thee far aside :</l>
     <l n="242">Yet turn ; these sin-traps from thy shop expel ,</l>
     <l n="243">Repent and pray , and all may yet be well .</l>
     <l n="244">“ And here thy wife , thy Dorothy behold ,</l>
     <l n="245">How fashion 's wanton robes her form infold !</l>
     <l n="246">Can grace , can goodness with such trappings dwell ?</l>
     <l n="247">John , thou hast made thy wife a Jezebel :</l>
     <l n="248">See ! on her bosom rests the sign of sin ,</l>
     <l n="249">The glaring proof of naughty thoughts within :</l>
     <l n="250">What ! ‘ tis a cross : come hither — as a friend ,</l>
     <l n="251">Thus from thy neck the shameful badge I rend . ”</l>
     <l n="252">“ Rend , if you dare , ” said Dighton ; “ you shall find</l>
     <l n="253">A man of spirit , though to peace inclined ;</l>
     <l n="254">Call me ungrateful ! have I not my pay</l>
     <l n="255">At all times ready for the expected day ?</l>
     <l n="256">To share my plenteous board you deign to come ,</l>
     <l n="257">Myself your pupil , and my house your home :</l>
     <l n="258">And shall the persons who my meat enjoy</l>
     <l n="259">Talk of my faults , and treat me as a boy ?</l>
     <l n="260">Have you not told how Rome 's insulting priests</l>
     <l n="261">Led their meek laymen like a herd of beasts ;</l>
     <l n="262">And by their fleecing and their forgery made</l>
     <l n="263">Their holy calling an accursed trade ?</l>
     <l n="264">Can you such acts and insolence condemn ,</l>
     <l n="265">Who to your utmost power resemble them ?</l>
     <l n="266">“ Concerns it you what books I set for sale ?</l>
     <l n="267">The tale perchance may be a virtuous tale ;</l>
     <l n="268">And for the rest , ‘ tis neither wise nor just</l>
     <l n="269">In you , who read not , to condemn on trust ;</l>
     <l n="270">Why should th ’ Archdeacon 's Charge your spleen excite ?</l>
     <l n="271">He , or perchance th ’ Archbishop , may be right .</l>
     <l n="272">“ That from your meetings I refrain is true :</l>
     <l n="273">I meet with nothing pleasant — nothing new ;</l>
     <l n="274">But the same proofs , that not one text explain ,</l>
     <l n="275">And the same lights , where all things dark remain ;</l>
     <l n="276">I thought you saints on earth — but I have found</l>
     <l n="277">Some sins among you , and the best unsound :</l>
     <l n="278">You have your failings , like the crowds below ,</l>
     <l n="279">And at your pleasure hot and cold can blow :</l>
     <l n="280">When I at first your grave deportment saw ,</l>
     <l n="281">( I own my folly ,) I was fill 'd with awe ;</l>
     <l n="282">You spoke so warmly , and it seem 'd so well ,</l>
     <l n="283">I should have thought it treason to rebel .</l>
     <l n="284">Is it a wonder that a man like me</l>
     <l n="285">Should such perfection in such teachers see -</l>
     <l n="286">Nay , should conceive you sent from Heaven to brave</l>
     <l n="287">The host of sin , and sinful souls to save ?</l>
     <l n="288">But as our reason wakes , our prospects clear ,</l>
     <l n="289">And failings , flaws , and blemishes appear .</l>
     <l n="290">“ When you were mounted in your rostrum high ,</l>
     <l n="291">We shrank beneath your tone , your frown , your eye :</l>
     <l n="292">Then you beheld us abject , fallen , low ,</l>
     <l n="293">And felt your glory from our baseness grow ;</l>
     <l n="294">Touch 'd by your words , I trembled like the rest ,</l>
     <l n="295">And my own vileness and your power confess 'd :</l>
     <l n="296">These , I exclaim 'd , are men divine , and gazed</l>
     <l n="297">On him who taught , delighted and amazed ;</l>
     <l n="298">Glad when he finish 'd , if by chance he cast</l>
     <l n="299">One look on such a sinner as he pass 'd .</l>
     <l n="300">“ But when I view 'd you in a clearer light ,</l>
     <l n="301">And saw the frail and carnal appetite ;</l>
     <l n="302">When at his humble pray'r , you deign 'd to eat ,</l>
     <l n="303">Saints as you are , a civil sinner 's meat ;</l>
     <l n="304">When , as you sat contented and at ease ,</l>
     <l n="305">Nibbling at leisure on the ducks and peas ,</l>
     <l n="306">And , pleased some comforts in such place to find ,</l>
     <l n="307">You could descend to be a little kind ;</l>
     <l n="308">And gave us hope in heaven there might be room</l>
     <l n="309">For a few souls beside your own to come ;</l>
     <l n="310">While this world 's good engaged your carnal view ,</l>
     <l n="311">And like a sinner you enjoy 'd it too ;</l>
     <l n="312">All this perceiving , can you think it strange</l>
     <l n="313">That change in you should work an equal change ? ”</l>
     <l n="314">“ Wretch that thou art , ” an elder cried , “ and gone</l>
     <l n="315">For everlasting ! ” — “ Go thyself , ” said John ;</l>
     <l n="316">Depart this instant , let me hear no more ;</l>
     <l n="317">My house my castle is , and that my door . ”</l>
     <l n="318">The hint they took , and from the door withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="319">And John to meeting bade a long adieu ;</l>
     <l n="320">Attached to business , he in time became</l>
     <l n="321">A wealthy man of no inferior name .</l>
     <l n="322">It seem 'd , alas ! in John 's deluded sight ,</l>
     <l n="323">That all was wrong because not all was right :</l>
     <l n="324">And when he found his teachers had their stains ,</l>
     <l n="325">Resentment and not reason broke his chains :</l>
     <l n="326">Thus on his feelings he again relied ,</l>
     <l n="327">And never look 'd to reason for his guide :</l>
     <l n="328">Could he have wisely view 'd the frailty shown ,</l>
     <l n="329">And rightly weigh 'd their wanderings and his own ,</l>
     <l n="330">He might have known that men may be sincere ,</l>
     <l n="331">Though gay and feasting on the savoury cheer ;</l>
     <l n="332">That doctrines sound and sober they may teach ,</l>
     <l n="333">Who love to eat with all the glee they preach ;</l>
     <l n="334">Nay ! who believe the duck , the grape , the pine ,</l>
     <l n="335">Were not intended for the dog and swine :</l>
     <l n="336">But Dighton 's hasty mind on every theme</l>
     <l n="337">Ran from the truth , and rested in th ’ extreme :</l>
     <l n="338">Flaws in his friends he found , and then withdrew</l>
     <l n="339">( Vain of his knowledge ) from their virtues too ,</l>
     <l n="340">Best of his books he loved the liberal kind</l>
     <l n="341">That , if they improve not , still enlarge the mind ;</l>
     <l n="342">And found himself , with such advisers , free</l>
     <l n="343">From a fix 'd creed , as mind enlarged could be .</l>
     <l n="344">His humble wife at these opinions sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="345">But her he never heeded till she died :</l>
     <l n="346">He then assented to a last request ,</l>
     <l n="347">And by the meeting-window let her rest ;</l>
     <l n="348">And on her stone the sacred text was seen ,</l>
     <l n="349">Which had her comfort in departing been .</l>
     <l n="350">Dighton with joy beheld his trade advance ,</l>
     <l n="351">Yet seldom published , loth to trust to chance :</l>
     <l n="352">Then wed a doctor 's sister — poor indeed ,</l>
     <l n="353">But skill 'd in works her husband could not read ;</l>
     <l n="354">Who , if he wish 'd new ways of wealth to seek ,</l>
     <l n="355">Could make her half-crown pamphlet in a week :</l>
     <l n="356">This he rejected , though without disdain .</l>
     <l n="357">And chose the old and certain way to gain .</l>
     <l n="358">Thus he proceeded : trade increased the while ,</l>
     <l n="359">And fortune woo 'd him with perpetual smile :</l>
     <l n="360">On early scenes he sometimes cast a thought ,</l>
     <l n="361">When on his heart the mighty change was wrought ;</l>
     <l n="362">And all the ease and comfort Converts find</l>
     <l n="363">Was magnified in his reflecting mind :</l>
     <l n="364">Then on the teacher 's priestly pride he dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="365">That caused his freedom , but with this he felt</l>
     <l n="366">The danger of the free — for since that day</l>
     <l n="367">No guide had shown , no brethren join 'd his way ;</l>
     <l n="368">Forsaking one , he found no second creed ,</l>
     <l n="369">But reading doubted , doubting what to read .</l>
     <l n="370">Still , though reproof had brought some present pain ,</l>
     <l n="371">The gain he made was fair and honest gain ;</l>
     <l n="372">He laid his wares indeed in public view ,</l>
     <l n="373">But that all traders claim a right to do :</l>
     <l n="374">By means like these , he saw his wealth increase ,</l>
     <l n="375">And felt his consequence , and dwelt in peace .</l>
     <l n="376">Our Hero 's age was threescore years and five ,</l>
     <l n="377">When he exclaim 'd , “ Why longer should I strive ?</l>
     <l n="378">Why more amass , who never must behold</l>
     <l n="379">A young John Dighton to make glad the old ? ”</l>
     <l n="380">( The sons he had to early graves were gone ,</l>
     <l n="381">And girls were burdens to the mind of John . )</l>
     <l n="382">“ Had I a boy , he would our name sustain ,</l>
     <l n="383">That now to nothing must return again ;</l>
     <l n="384">But what are all my profits , credit , trade ,</l>
     <l n="385">And parish honours ?— folly and parade . ”</l>
     <l n="386">Thus Dighton thought , and in his looks appeared</l>
     <l n="387">Sadness , increased by much he saw and heard ;</l>
     <l n="388">The Brethren often at the shop would stay ,</l>
     <l n="389">And make their comments ere they walk 'd away ;</l>
     <l n="390">They mark 'd the window , fill 'd in every pane</l>
     <l n="391">With lawless prints of reputations slain ;</l>
     <l n="392">Distorted forms of men with honours graced ,</l>
     <l n="393">And our chief rulers in dirision placed :</l>
     <l n="394">Amazed they stood , remembering well the days</l>
     <l n="395">When to be humble was their brother 's praise ;</l>
     <l n="396">When at the dwelling of their friend they stopped ;</l>
     <l n="397">To drop a word , or to receive it dropp 'd ;</l>
     <l n="398">Where they beheld the prints of men renown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="399">And far-famed preachers pasted all around ,</l>
     <l n="400">( Such mouths ! eyes ! hair ! so prim ! so fierce ! so sleek !</l>
     <l n="401">They look 'd as speaking what is woe to speak ):</l>
     <l n="402">On these the passing brethren loved to dwell -</l>
     <l n="403">How long they spake ! how strongly ! warmly ! well !</l>
     <l n="404">What power had each to dive in mysteries deep ,</l>
     <l n="405">To warm the cold , to make the harden 'd weep ;</l>
     <l n="406">To lure , to fright , to soothe , to awe the soul ,</l>
     <l n="407">And listening locks to lead and to control !</l>
     <l n="408">But now discoursing , as they linger 'd near ,</l>
     <l n="409">They tempted John ( whom they accused ) to hear</l>
     <l n="410">Their weighty charge — “ And can the lost one feel ,</l>
     <l n="411">As in the time of duty , love , and zeal ;</l>
     <l n="412">When all were summon 'd at the rising sun ,</l>
     <l n="413">And he was ready with his friends to run ;</l>
     <l n="414">When he , partaking with a chosen few ,</l>
     <l n="415">Felt the great change , sensation rich and new ?</l>
     <l n="416">No ! all is lost ; her favours Fortune shower 'd</l>
     <l n="417">Upon the man , and he is overpower 'd ;</l>
     <l n="418">The world has won him with its tempting store</l>
     <l n="419">Of needless wealth , and that has made him poor :</l>
     <l n="420">Success undoes him ; he has risen to fall ,</l>
     <l n="421">Has gain 'd a fortune , and has lost his all ;</l>
     <l n="422">Gone back from Sion , he will find his age</l>
     <l n="423">Loth to commence a second pilgrimage ;</l>
     <l n="424">He has retreated from the chosen track ,</l>
     <l n="425">And now must ever bear the burden on his back . ”</l>
     <l n="426">Hurt by such censure , John began to find</l>
     <l n="427">Fresh revolutions working in his mind ;</l>
     <l n="428">He sought for comfort in his books , but read</l>
     <l n="429">Without a plan or method in his head ;</l>
     <l n="430">What once amused , now rather made him sad ;</l>
     <l n="431">What should inform , increased the doubts he had ;</l>
     <l n="432">Shame would not let him seek at Church a guide ,</l>
     <l n="433">And from his Meeting he was held by pride ;</l>
     <l n="434">His wife derided fears she never felt ,</l>
     <l n="435">And passing brethren daily censures dealt ;</l>
     <l n="436">Hope for a son was now for ever past ,</l>
     <l n="437">He was the first John Dighton and the last ;</l>
     <l n="438">His stomach fail 'd , his case the doctor knew ,</l>
     <l n="439">But said , “ he still might hold a year or two . ”</l>
     <l n="440">“ No more ! ” he said ; “ but why should I complain ?</l>
     <l n="441">A life of doubt must be a life of pain :</l>
     <l n="442">Could I be sure — but why should I despair ?</l>
     <l n="443">I 'm sure my conduct has been just and fair ;</l>
     <l n="444">In youth , indeed , I had a wicked will ,</l>
     <l n="445">But I repented , and have sorrow still :</l>
     <l n="446">I had my comforts , and a growing trade</l>
     <l n="447">Gave greater pleasure than a fortune made ;</l>
     <l n="448">And as I more possess 'd , and reason 'd more ,</l>
     <l n="449">I lost those comforts I enjoy 'd before ,</l>
     <l n="450">When reverend guides I saw my table round ,</l>
     <l n="451">And in my guardian guest my safety found :</l>
     <l n="452">Now sick and sad , no appetite , no ease ,</l>
     <l n="453">Nor pleasures have I , nor a wish to please ;</l>
     <l n="454">Nor views , nor hopes , nor plans , nor taste have I ;</l>
     <l n="455">Yet , sick of life , have no desire to die . ”</l>
     <l n="456">He said , and died : his trade , his name is gone ,</l>
     <l n="457">And all that once gave consequence to John .</l>
     <l n="458">Unhappy Dighton ! had he found a friend</l>
     <l n="459">When conscience told him it was time to mend -</l>
     <l n="460">A friend descreet , considerate , kind , sincere ,</l>
     <l n="461">Who would have shown the grounds of hope and fear ,</l>
     <l n="462">And proved that spirits , whether high or low ,</l>
     <l n="463">No certain tokens of man 's safety show -</l>
     <l n="464">Had Reason ruled him in her proper place ,</l>
     <l n="465">And Virtue led him while he lean 'd on grace -</l>
     <l n="466">Had he while zealous been discreet and pure ,</l>
     <l n="467">His knowledge humble , and his hope secure ; -</l>
     <l n="468">These guides had placed him on the solid rock ,</l>
     <l n="469">Where Faith had rested , nor received a shock ;</l>
     <l n="470">But his , alas ! was placed upon the sand ,</l>
     <l n="471">Where long it stood not , and where none can stand .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="12">Than old George Fletcher , on the British coast</l>
     <l n="13">Dwelt not a seaman who had more to boast :</l>
     <l n="14">Kind , simple and sincere — he seldom spoke ,</l>
     <l n="15">But sometimes sang and chorus 'd — “ Hearts of Oak : ”</l>
     <l n="16">In dangers steady , with his lot content ,</l>
     <l n="17">His days in labour and in love were spent .</l>
     <l n="18">He left a Son so like him , that the old</l>
     <l n="19">With joy exclaim 'd , “ ‘ Tis Fletcher we behold ; ”</l>
     <l n="20">But to his Brother , when the kinsmen came</l>
     <l n="21">And view 'd his form , they grudged the father 's name .</l>
     <l n="22">George was a bold , intrepid , careless lad ,</l>
     <l n="23">With just the failings that his father had ;</l>
     <l n="24">Isaac was weak , attentive , slow , exact ,</l>
     <l n="25">With just the virtues that his father lack 'd .</l>
     <l n="26">George lived at sea : upon the land a guest -</l>
     <l n="27">He sought for recreation , not for rest ;</l>
     <l n="28">While , far unlike , his brother 's feebler form</l>
     <l n="29">Shrank from the cold , and shudder 'd at the storm ;</l>
     <l n="30">Still with the Seaman 's to connect his trade ,</l>
     <l n="31">The boy was bound where blocks and ropes were made .</l>
     <l n="32">George , strong and sturdy , had a tender mind ,</l>
     <l n="33">And was to Isaac pitiful and kind ;</l>
     <l n="34">A very father , till his art was gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="35">And then a friend unwearied he remain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="36">He saw his brother was of spirit low ,</l>
     <l n="37">His temper peevish , and his motions slow ;</l>
     <l n="38">Not fit to bustle in a world , or make</l>
     <l n="39">Friends to his fortune for his merit 's sake ;</l>
     <l n="40">But the kind sailor could not boast the art</l>
     <l n="41">Of looking deeply in the human heart ;</l>
     <l n="42">Else had he seen that this weak brother knew</l>
     <l n="43">What men to court — what objects to pursue ;</l>
     <l n="44">That he to distant gain the way discern 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">And none so crooked but his genius learn 'd .</l>
     <l n="46">Isaac was poor , and this the brother felt ;</l>
     <l n="47">He hired a house , and there the Landman dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="48">Wrought at his trade , and had an easy home ,</l>
     <l n="49">For there would George with cash and comforts come ;</l>
     <l n="50">And when they parted , Isaac look 'd around</l>
     <l n="51">Where other friends and helpers might be found .</l>
     <l n="52">He wish 'd for some port-place , and one might fall ,</l>
     <l n="53">He wisely thought , if he should try for all ;</l>
     <l n="54">He had a vote — and were it well applied ,</l>
     <l n="55">Might have its worth — and he had views beside ;</l>
     <l n="56">Old Burgess Steel was able to promote</l>
     <l n="57">An humble man who served him with a vote ;</l>
     <l n="58">For Isaac felt not what some tempers feel ,</l>
     <l n="59">But bow 'd and bent the neck to Burgess Steel ;</l>
     <l n="60">And great attention to a lady gave ,</l>
     <l n="61">His ancient friend , a maiden spare and grave ;</l>
     <l n="62">One whom the visage long and look demure</l>
     <l n="63">Of Isaac pleased — he seem 'd sedate and pure ;</l>
     <l n="64">And his soft heart conceived a gentle flame</l>
     <l n="65">For her who waited on this virtuous dame .</l>
     <l n="66">Not an outrageous love , a scorching fire ,</l>
     <l n="67">But friendly liking and chastised desire ;</l>
     <l n="68">And thus he waited , patient in delay ,</l>
     <l n="69">In present favour and in fortune 's way .</l>
     <l n="70">George then was coasting — war was yet delay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="71">And what he gain 'd was to his brother paid ;</l>
     <l n="72">Nor ask 'd the Seaman what he saved or spent ,</l>
     <l n="73">But took his grog , wrought hard , and was content ;</l>
     <l n="74">Till war awaked the land , and George began</l>
     <l n="75">To think what part became a useful man :</l>
     <l n="76">“ Press 'd , I must go : why , then , ‘ tis better far</l>
     <l n="77">At once to enter like a British tar ,</l>
     <l n="78">Than a brave captain and the foe to shun ,</l>
     <l n="79">As if I fear 'd the music of a gun . ”</l>
     <l n="80">“ Go not ! ” said Isaac — “ you shall wear disguise . ”</l>
     <l n="81">“ What ! ” said the Seaman , “ clothe myself with lies ! ”</l>
     <l n="82">“ Oh ! but there 's danger . ” — “ Danger in the fleet ?</l>
     <l n="83">You cannot mean , good brother , of defeat ;</l>
     <l n="84">And other dangers I at land must share -</l>
     <l n="85">So now adieu ! and trust a brother 's care . ”</l>
     <l n="86">Isaac awhile demurr 'd — but , in his heart ,</l>
     <l n="87">So might he share , he was disposed to part :</l>
     <l n="88">The better mind will sometimes feel the pain</l>
     <l n="89">Of benefactions — favour is a chain ;</l>
     <l n="90">But they the feeling scorn , and what they wish , disdain ;</l>
     <l n="91">While beings form 'd in coarser mould will hate</l>
     <l n="92">The helping hand they ought to venerate :</l>
     <l n="93">No wonder George should in this cause prevail ,</l>
     <l n="94">With one contending who was glad to fail :</l>
     <l n="95">“ Isaac , farewell ! do wipe that doleful eye ;</l>
     <l n="96">Crying we came , and groaning we may die ;</l>
     <l n="97">Let us do something ‘ twixt the groan and cry :</l>
     <l n="98">And hear me , brother , whether pay or prize ,</l>
     <l n="99">One half to thee I give and I devise ;</l>
     <l n="100">Por thou hast oft occasion for the aid</l>
     <l n="101">Of learn 'd physicians , and they will be paid ;</l>
     <l n="102">Their wives and children men support at sea ,</l>
     <l n="103">And thou , my lad , art wife and child to me :</l>
     <l n="104">Farewell ! I go where hope and honour call ,</l>
     <l n="105">Nor does it follow that who fights must fall , ”</l>
     <l n="106">Isaac here made a poor attempt to speak ,</l>
     <l n="107">And a huge tear moved slowly down his cheek ;</l>
     <l n="108">Like Pluto 's iron drop , hard sign of grace ,</l>
     <l n="109">It slowly roll 'd upon the rueful face ,</l>
     <l n="110">Forced by the striving will alone its way to trace .</l>
     <l n="111">Years fled — war lasted — George at sea remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="112">While the slow Landman still his profits gain 'd :</l>
     <l n="113">An humble place was vacant — he besought</l>
     <l n="114">His patron 's interest , and the office caught ;</l>
     <l n="115">For still the Virgin was his faithful friend ,</l>
     <l n="116">And one so sober could with truth commend ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who of his own defects most humbly thought ,</l>
     <l n="118">And their advice with zeal and reverence sought :</l>
     <l n="119">Whom thus the Mistress praised , the Maid approved ,</l>
     <l n="120">And her he wedded whom he wisely loved .</l>
     <l n="121">No more he needs assistance — but , alas !</l>
     <l n="122">He fears the money will for liquor pass ;</l>
     <l n="123">Or that the Seaman might to flatterers lend ,</l>
     <l n="124">Or give support to some pretended friend :</l>
     <l n="125">Still he must write — he wrote , and he confess 'd</l>
     <l n="126">That , till absolved , he should be sore distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="127">But one so friendly would , he thought , forgive</l>
     <l n="128">The hasty deed — Heav'n knew how he should live ;</l>
     <l n="129">“ But you , ” he added , “ as a man of sense ,</l>
     <l n="130">Have well consider 'd danger and expense :</l>
     <l n="131">I ran , alas ! into the fatal snare ,</l>
     <l n="132">And now for trouble must my mind prepare ;</l>
     <l n="133">And how , with children , I shall pick my way</l>
     <l n="134">Through a hard world , is more than I can say :</l>
     <l n="135">Then change not , Brother , your more happy state ,</l>
     <l n="136">Or on the hazard long deliberate . ”</l>
     <l n="137">George answered gravely , “ It is right and fit ,</l>
     <l n="138">In all our crosses , humbly to submit :</l>
     <l n="139">Your apprehensions are unwise , unjust ;</l>
     <l n="140">Forbear repining , and expel distrust . ”</l>
     <l n="141">He added , “ Marriage was the joy of life , ”</l>
     <l n="142">And gave his service to his brother 's wife ;</l>
     <l n="143">Then vow 'd to bear in all expense a part ,</l>
     <l n="144">And thus concluded , “ Have a cheerful heart . ”</l>
     <l n="145">Had the glad Isaac been his brother 's guide ,</l>
     <l n="146">In the same terms the Seaman had replied ;</l>
     <l n="147">At such reproofs the crafty Landman smiled ,</l>
     <l n="148">And softly said , “ This creature is a child . ”</l>
     <l n="149">Twice had the gallant ship a capture made -</l>
     <l n="150">And when in port the happy crew were paid ,</l>
     <l n="151">Home went the Sailor , with his pockets stored ,</l>
     <l n="152">Ease to enjoy , and pleasure to afford ;</l>
     <l n="153">His time was short , joy shone in every face ,</l>
     <l n="154">Isaac half fainted in the fond embrace :</l>
     <l n="155">The wife resolved her honour 'd guest to please ,</l>
     <l n="156">The children clung upon their uncle 's knees ;</l>
     <l n="157">The grog went round , the neighbours drank his health ,</l>
     <l n="158">And George exclaimed , “ Ah ! what to this is wealth ?</l>
     <l n="159">Better , ” said he , “ to bear a loving heart ,</l>
     <l n="160">Than roll in riches — but we now must part ! ”</l>
     <l n="161">All yet is still — but hark ! the winds o'ersweep</l>
     <l n="162">The rising waves , and howl upon the deep ;</l>
     <l n="163">Ships late becalm 'd on mountain-billows ride -</l>
     <l n="164">So life is threaten 'd and so man is tried .</l>
     <l n="165">Ill were the tidings that arrived from sea ,</l>
     <l n="166">The worthy George must now a cripple be :</l>
     <l n="167">His leg was lopp 'd ; and though his heart was sound ,</l>
     <l n="168">Though his brave captain was with glory crown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="169">Yet much it vex 'd him to repose on shore ,</l>
     <l n="170">An idle log , and be of use no more :</l>
     <l n="171">True , he was sure that Isaac would receive</l>
     <l n="172">All of his Brother that the foe might leave ;</l>
     <l n="173">To whom the Seaman his design had sent ,</l>
     <l n="174">Ere from the port the wounded hero went :</l>
     <l n="175">His wealth and expectations told , he “ knew</l>
     <l n="176">Wherein they fail 'd , what Isaac 's love would do ;</l>
     <l n="177">That he the grog and cabin would supply ,</l>
     <l n="178">Where George at anchor during life would lie . ”</l>
     <l n="179">The Landman read — and , reading , grew distress 'd : -</l>
     <l n="180">“ Could he resolve t'admit so poor a guest ?</l>
     <l n="181">Better at Greenwich might the Sailor stay ,</l>
     <l n="182">Unless his purse could for his comforts pay . ”</l>
     <l n="183">So Isaac judged , and to his wife appealed ,</l>
     <l n="184">But yet acknowledged it was best to yield :</l>
     <l n="185">“ Perhaps his pension , with what sums remain</l>
     <l n="186">Due or unsquander 'd , may the man maintain ;</l>
     <l n="187">Refuse we must not . ” — With a heavy sigh</l>
     <l n="188">The lady heard , and made her kind reply : -</l>
     <l n="189">“ Nor would I wish it , Isaac , were we sure</l>
     <l n="190">How long this crazy building will endure ;</l>
     <l n="191">Like an old house , that every day appears</l>
     <l n="192">About to fall , he may be propp 'd for years ;</l>
     <l n="193">For a few months , indeed , we might comply ,</l>
     <l n="194">But these old batter 'd fellows never die . ”</l>
     <l n="195">The hand of Isaac , George on entering took ,</l>
     <l n="196">With love and resignation in his look ;</l>
     <l n="197">Declared his comfort in the fortune past ,</l>
     <l n="198">And joy to find his anchor safely cast :</l>
     <l n="199">“ Call then my nephews , let the grog be brought ,</l>
     <l n="200">And I will tell them how the ship was fought . ”</l>
     <l n="201">Alas ! our simple Seaman should have known</l>
     <l n="202">That all the care , the kindness , he had shown ,</l>
     <l n="203">Were from his Brother 's heart , if not his memory , flown :</l>
     <l n="204">All swept away , to be perceived no more ,</l>
     <l n="205">Like idle structures on the sandy shore ,</l>
     <l n="206">The chance amusement of the playful boy ,</l>
     <l n="207">That the rude billows in their rage destroy .</l>
     <l n="208">Poor George confess 'd , though loth the truth to find ,</l>
     <l n="209">Slight was his knowledge of a Brother 's mind :</l>
     <l n="210">The vulgar pipe was to the wife offence ,</l>
     <l n="211">The frequent grog to Isaac an expense ;</l>
     <l n="212">Would friends like hers , she question 'd , “ choose to come</l>
     <l n="213">Where clouds of poison 'd fume defiled a room ?</l>
     <l n="214">This could their Lady-friend , and Burgess Steel</l>
     <l n="215">( Teased with his worship 's asthma ) , bear to feel ?</l>
     <l n="216">Could they associate or converse with him -</l>
     <l n="217">A loud rough sailor with a timber limb ? ”</l>
     <l n="218">Cold as he grew , still Isaac strove to show ,</l>
     <l n="219">By well-feign 'd care , that cold he could not grow ;</l>
     <l n="220">And when he saw his brother look distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="221">He strove some petty comforts to suggest ;</l>
     <l n="222">On his wife solely their neglect to lay ,</l>
     <l n="223">And then t'excuse it , as a woman 's way ;</l>
     <l n="224">He too was chidden when her rules he broke ,</l>
     <l n="225">And when she sicken 'd at the scent of smoke .</l>
     <l n="226">George , though in doubt , was still consoled to find</l>
     <l n="227">His Brother wishing to be reckoned kind :</l>
     <l n="228">That Isaac seem 'd concern 'd by his distress ,</l>
     <l n="229">Gave to his injured feelings some redress ;</l>
     <l n="230">But none he found disposed to lend an ear</l>
     <l n="231">To stories , all were once intent to hear :</l>
     <l n="232">Except his nephew , seated on his knee ,</l>
     <l n="233">He found no creature cared about the sea ;</l>
     <l n="234">But George indeed — for George they call 'd the boy ,</l>
     <l n="235">When his good uncle was their boast and joy -</l>
     <l n="236">Would listen long , and would contend with sleep ,</l>
     <l n="237">To hear the woes and wonders of the deep ;</l>
     <l n="238">Till the fond mother cried — “ That man will teach</l>
     <l n="239">The foolish boy his rude and boisterous speech . ”</l>
     <l n="240">So judged the father — and the boy was taught</l>
     <l n="241">To shun the uncle , whom his love had sought .</l>
     <l n="242">The mask of kindness now but seldom worn ,</l>
     <l n="243">George felt each evil harder to be borne ;</l>
     <l n="244">And cried ( vexation growing day by day ) ,</l>
     <l n="245">“ Ah ! brother Isaac ! What ! I 'm in the way ! ”</l>
     <l n="246">“ No ! on my credit , look ye , No ! but I</l>
     <l n="247">Am fond of peace , and my repose would buy</l>
     <l n="248">On any terms — in short , we must comply :</l>
     <l n="249">My spouse had money — she must have her will -</l>
     <l n="250">Ah ! brother , marriage is a bitter pill . ”</l>
     <l n="251">George tried the lady — “ Sister , I offend . ”</l>
     <l n="252">“ Me ? ” she replied — “ Oh no ! you may depend</l>
     <l n="253">On my regard — but watch your brother 's way ,</l>
     <l n="254">Whom I , like you , must study and obey . ”</l>
     <l n="255">“ Ah ! ” thought the Seaman , “ what a head was mine ,</l>
     <l n="256">That easy berth at Greenwich to resign !</l>
     <l n="257">I 'll to the parish ” — but a little pride ,</l>
     <l n="258">And some affection , put the thought aside .</l>
     <l n="259">Now gross neglect and open scorn he bore</l>
     <l n="260">In silent sorrow — but he felt the more :</l>
     <l n="261">The odious pipe he to the kitchen took ,</l>
     <l n="262">Or strove to profit by some pious book .</l>
     <l n="263">When the mind stoops to this degraded state ,</l>
     <l n="264">New griefs will darken the dependant 's fate ;</l>
     <l n="265">“ Brother ! ” said Isaac , “ you will sure excuse</l>
     <l n="266">The little freedom I 'm compell 'd to use :</l>
     <l n="267">My wife 's relations — ( curse the haughty crew ! ) -</l>
     <l n="268">Affect such niceness , and such dread of you :</l>
     <l n="269">You speak so loud — and they have natures soft -</l>
     <l n="270">Brother — I wish — do go upon the loft ! ”</l>
     <l n="271">Poor George obey 'd , and to the garret fled ,</l>
     <l n="272">Where not a being saw the tears he shed :</l>
     <l n="273">But more was yet required , for guests were come ,</l>
     <l n="274">Who could not dine if he disgraced the room .</l>
     <l n="275">It shock 'd his spirit to be esteem 'd unfit</l>
     <l n="276">With an own brother and his wife to sit ;</l>
     <l n="277">He grew rebellious — at the vestry spoke</l>
     <l n="278">For weekly aid — they heard it as a joke :</l>
     <l n="279">“ So kind a brother , and so wealthy — you</l>
     <l n="280">Apply to us ?— No ! this will never do :</l>
     <l n="281">Good neighbour Fletcher , ” said the Overseer ,</l>
     <l n="282">“ We are engaged — you can have nothing here ! ”</l>
     <l n="283">George mutter 'd something in despairing tone ,</l>
     <l n="284">Then sought his loft , to think and grieve alone ;</l>
     <l n="285">Neglected , slighted , restless on his bed ,</l>
     <l n="286">With heart half broken , and with scraps ill fed ;</l>
     <l n="287">Yet was he pleased that hours for play design 'd</l>
     <l n="288">Were given to ease his ever-troubled mind ;</l>
     <l n="289">The child still listen 'd with increasing joy ,</l>
     <l n="290">And he was sooth 'd by the attentive boy .</l>
     <l n="291">At length he sicken 'd , and this duteous child</l>
     <l n="292">Watch 'd o'er his sickness , and his pains beguiled ;</l>
     <l n="293">The mother bade him from the loft refrain ,</l>
     <l n="294">But , though with caution , yet he went again ;</l>
     <l n="295">And now his tales the Sailor feebly told ,</l>
     <l n="296">His heart was heavy , and his limbs were cold :</l>
     <l n="297">The tender boy came often to entreat</l>
     <l n="298">His good kind friend would of his presents eat ;</l>
     <l n="299">Purloin 'd or purchased , for he saw , with shame ,</l>
     <l n="300">The food untouch 'd that to his uncle came ;</l>
     <l n="301">Who , sick in body and in mind , received</l>
     <l n="302">The boy 's indulgence , gratified and grieved .</l>
     <l n="303">“ Uncle will die ! ” said George : — the piteous wife</l>
     <l n="304">Exclaim 'd , “ she saw no value in his life ;</l>
     <l n="305">But , sick or well , to my commands attend ,</l>
     <l n="306">And go no more to your complaining friend . ”</l>
     <l n="307">The boy was vex 'd , he felt his heart reprove</l>
     <l n="308">The stern decree .— What ! punish 'd for his love !</l>
     <l n="309">No ! he would go , but softly , to the room ,</l>
     <l n="310">Stealing in silence — for he knew his doom .</l>
     <l n="311">Once in a week the father came to say ,</l>
     <l n="312">“ George , are you ill ? ” and hurried him away ;</l>
     <l n="313">Yet to his wife would on their duties dwell ,</l>
     <l n="314">And often cry , “ Do use my brother well : ”</l>
     <l n="315">And something kind , no question , Isaac meant ,</l>
     <l n="316">Who took vast credit for the vague intent .</l>
     <l n="317">But , truly kind , the gentle boy essay 'd</l>
     <l n="318">To cheer his uncle , firm , although afraid ;</l>
     <l n="319">But now the father caught him at the door ,</l>
     <l n="320">And , swearing — yes , the man in office swore ,</l>
     <l n="321">And cried , “ Away ! How ! Brother , I 'm surprised</l>
     <l n="322">That one so old can be so ill advised :</l>
     <l n="323">Let him not dare to visit you again ,</l>
     <l n="324">Your cursed stories will disturb his brain ;</l>
     <l n="325">Is it not vile to court a foolish boy ,</l>
     <l n="326">Your own absurd narrations to enjoy ?</l>
     <l n="327">What ! sullen !— ha , George Fletcher ! you shall see ,</l>
     <l n="328">Proud as you are , your bread depends on me ! ”</l>
     <l n="329">He spoke , and , frowning , to his dinner went ,</l>
     <l n="330">Then cool 'd and felt some qualms of discontent :</l>
     <l n="331">And thought on times when he compell 'd his son</l>
     <l n="332">To hear these stories , nay , to beg for one ;</l>
     <l n="333">But the wife 's wrath o'ercame the brother 's pain ,</l>
     <l n="334">And shame was felt , and conscience rose , in vain .</l>
     <l n="335">George yet stole up ; he saw his Uncle lie</l>
     <l n="336">Sick on the bed , and heard his heavy sigh ;</l>
     <l n="337">So he resolved , before he went to rest ,</l>
     <l n="338">To comfort one so dear and so distressed ;</l>
     <l n="339">Then watch 'd his time , but , with a child-like art ,</l>
     <l n="340">Betray 'd a something treasured at his heart :</l>
     <l n="341">Th ’ observant wife remark 'd , “ The boy is grown</l>
     <l n="342">So like your brother , that he seems his own :</l>
     <l n="343">So close and sullen ! and I still suspect</l>
     <l n="344">They often meet : — do watch them and detect . ”</l>
     <l n="345">George now remark 'd that all was still as night ,</l>
     <l n="346">And hasten 'd up with terror and delight ;</l>
     <l n="347">“ Uncle ! ” he cried , and softly tapp 'd the door ,</l>
     <l n="348">Do let me in ” — but he could add no more ;</l>
     <l n="349">The careful father caught him in the fact ,</l>
     <l n="350">And cried ,— “ You serpent ! is it thus you act ?</l>
     <l n="351">“ Back to your mother ! ” — and , with hasty blow ,</l>
     <l n="352">He sent th ’ indignant boy to grieve below ;</l>
     <l n="353">Then at the door an angry speech began -</l>
     <l n="354">“ Is this your conduct ?— Is it thus you plan ?</l>
     <l n="355">Seduce my child , and make my house a scene</l>
     <l n="356">Of vile dispute — What is it that you mean ?</l>
     <l n="357">George , are you dumb ? do learn to know your friends ,</l>
     <l n="358">And think a while on whom your bread depends .</l>
     <l n="359">What ! not a word ? be thankful I am cool -</l>
     <l n="360">But , sir , beware , nor longer play the fool .</l>
     <l n="361">Come ! brother , come ! what is it that you seek</l>
     <l n="362">By this rebellion ?— Speak , you villain , speak !</l>
     <l n="363">Weeping ! I warrant — sorrow makes you dumb :</l>
     <l n="364">I 'll ope your mouth , impostor ! if I come :</l>
     <l n="365">Let me approach — I 'll shake you from the bed ,</l>
     <l n="366">You stubborn dog — Oh God ! my Brother 's dead ! ”</l>
     <l n="367">Timid was Isaac , and in all the past</l>
     <l n="368">He felt a purpose to be kind at last :</l>
     <l n="369">Nor did he mean his brother to depart ,</l>
     <l n="370">Till he had shown this kindness of his heart ;</l>
     <l n="371">But day by day he put the cause aside ,</l>
     <l n="372">Induced by av'rice , peevishness , or pride .</l>
     <l n="373">But now awaken 'd , from this fatal time</l>
     <l n="374">His conscience Isaac felt , and found his crime :</l>
     <l n="375">He raised to George a monumental stone ,</l>
     <l n="376">And there retired to sigh and think alone ;</l>
     <l n="377">An ague seized him , he grew pale , and shook -</l>
     <l n="378">“ So , ” said his son , “ would my poor Uncle look . ”</l>
     <l n="379">“ And so , my child , shall I like him expire . ”</l>
     <l n="380">“ No ! you have physic and a cheerful fire . ”</l>
     <l n="381">“ Unhappy sinner ! yes , I 'm well supplied</l>
     <l n="382">With every comfort my cold heart denied . ”</l>
     <l n="383">He view 'd his Brother now , but not as one</l>
     <l n="384">Who vex 'd his wife by fondness for her son ;</l>
     <l n="385">Not as with wooden limb , and seaman 's tale ,</l>
     <l n="386">The odious pipe , vile grog , or humbler ale :</l>
     <l n="387">He now the worth and grief alone can view</l>
     <l n="388">Of one so mild , so generous , and so true ;</l>
     <l n="389">“ The frank , kind Brother , with such open heart , -</l>
     <l n="390">And I to break it — ‘ twas a demon 's part ! ”</l>
     <l n="391">So Isaac now , as led by conscience , feels ,</l>
     <l n="392">Nor his unkindness palliates or conceals ;</l>
     <l n="393">“ This is your folly , ” said his heartless wife :</l>
     <l n="394">“ Alas ! my folly cost my Brother 's life ;</l>
     <l n="395">It suffer 'd him to languish and decay -</l>
     <l n="396">My gentle Brother , whom I could not pay ,</l>
     <l n="397">And therefore left to pine , and fret his life away ! ”</l>
     <l n="398">He takes his Son , and bids the boy unfold</l>
     <l n="399">All the good Uncle of his feelings told ,</l>
     <l n="400">All he lamented — and the ready tear</l>
     <l n="401">Falls as he listens , soothed , and grieved to hear .</l>
     <l n="402">“ Did he not curse me , child ? ” — “ He never cursed ,</l>
     <l n="403">But could not breathe , and said his heart would burst . ”</l>
     <l n="404">“ And so will mine : ” — “ Then , father , you must pray :</l>
     <l n="405">My uncle said it took his pains away . ”</l>
     <l n="406">Repeating thus his sorrows , Isaac shows</l>
     <l n="407">That he , repenting , feels the debt he owes ,</l>
     <l n="408">And from this source alone his every comfort flows .</l>
     <l n="409">He takes no joy in office , honours , gain ;</l>
     <l n="410">They make him humble , nay , they give him pain :</l>
     <l n="411">“ These from my heart , ” he cries , “ all feeling drove ;</l>
     <l n="412">They made me cold to nature , dead to love . ”</l>
     <l n="413">He takes no joy in home , but sighing , sees</l>
     <l n="414">A son in sorrow , and a wife at ease ;</l>
     <l n="415">He takes no joy in office — see him now ,</l>
     <l n="416">And Burgess Steel has but a passing bow ;</l>
     <l n="417">Of one sad train of gloomy thoughts possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="418">He takes no joy in friends , in food , in rest -</l>
     <l n="419">Dark are the evil days , and void of peace the best .</l>
     <l n="420">And thus he lives , if living be to sigh ,</l>
     <l n="421">And from all comforts of the world to fly ,</l>
     <l n="422">Without a hope in life — without a wish to die .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">An honest man was Farmer Jones , and true ;</l>
     <l n="9">He did by all as all by him should do ;</l>
     <l n="10">Grave , cautious , careful , fond of gain was he ,</l>
     <l n="11">Yet famed for rustic hospitality :</l>
     <l n="12">Left with his children in a widow 'd state ,</l>
     <l n="13">The quiet man submitted to his fate ;</l>
     <l n="14">Though prudent matrons waited for his call ,</l>
     <l n="15">With cool forbearance he avoided all ;</l>
     <l n="16">Though each profess 'd a pure maternal joy ,</l>
     <l n="17">By kind attention to his feeble boy ;</l>
     <l n="18">And though a friendly Widow knew no rest ,</l>
     <l n="19">Whilst neighbour Jones was lonely and distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="20">Nay , though the maidens spoke in tender tone</l>
     <l n="21">Their hearts ’ concern to see him left alone ,</l>
     <l n="22">Jones still persisted in that cheerless life ,</l>
     <l n="23">As if ‘ twere sin to take a second wife .</l>
     <l n="24">Oh ! ‘ tis a precious thing , when wives are dead ,</l>
     <l n="25">To find such numbers who will serve instead ;</l>
     <l n="26">And in whatever state a man be thrown ,</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Tis that precisely they would wish their own ;</l>
     <l n="28">Left the departed infants — then their joy</l>
     <l n="29">Is to sustain each lovely girl and boy :</l>
     <l n="30">Whatever calling his , whatever trade ,</l>
     <l n="31">To that their chief attention has been paid ;</l>
     <l n="32">His happy taste in all things they approve ,</l>
     <l n="33">His friends they honour , and his food they love ;</l>
     <l n="34">His wish for order , prudence in affairs ,</l>
     <l n="35">An equal temper ( thank their stars ! ) , are theirs ;</l>
     <l n="36">In fact , it seem 'd to be a thing decreed ,</l>
     <l n="37">And fix 'd as fate , that marriage must succeed :</l>
     <l n="38">Yet some , like Jones , with stubborn hearts and hard ,</l>
     <l n="39">Can hear such claims and show them no regard .</l>
     <l n="40">Soon as our Farmer , like a general , found</l>
     <l n="41">By what strong foes he was encompass 'd round ,</l>
     <l n="42">Engage he dared not , and he could not fly ,</l>
     <l n="43">But saw his hope in gentle parley lie ;</l>
     <l n="44">With looks of kindness then , and trembling heart ,</l>
     <l n="45">He met the foe , and art opposed to art .</l>
     <l n="46">Now spoke that foe insidious — gentle tones ,</l>
     <l n="47">And gentle looks , assumed for Farmer Jones :</l>
     <l n="48">“ Three girls , ” the Widow cried , “ a lively three</l>
     <l n="49">To govern well — indeed it cannot be . ”</l>
     <l n="50">“ Yes , ” he replied , “ it calls for pains and care :</l>
     <l n="51">But I must bear it . ” — “ Sir , you cannot bear ;</l>
     <l n="52">Your son is weak , and asks a mother 's eye : ”</l>
     <l n="53">“ That , my kind friend , a father 's may supply . ”</l>
     <l n="54">“ Such growing griefs your very soul will tease ; ”</l>
     <l n="55">“ To grieve another would not give me ease -</l>
     <l n="56">I have a mother , ” — “ She , poor ancient soul !</l>
     <l n="57">Can she the spirits of the young control ?</l>
     <l n="58">Can she thy peace promote , partake thy care ,</l>
     <l n="59">Procure thy comforts , and thy sorrows share ?</l>
     <l n="60">Age is itself impatient , uncontroll 'd : ”</l>
     <l n="61">But wives like mothers must at length be old . ”</l>
     <l n="62">Thou hast shrewd servants — they are evils sore ? ”</l>
     <l n="63">Yet a shrewd mistress might afflict me more . ”</l>
     <l n="64">Wilt thou not be a weary , wailing man ? ”</l>
     <l n="65">Alas ! and I must bear it as I can . ”</l>
     <l n="66">Resisted thus , the Widow soon withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="67">That in his pride the Hero might pursue ;</l>
     <l n="68">And off his wonted guard , in some retreat</l>
     <l n="69">Find from a foe prepared entire defeat :</l>
     <l n="70">But he was prudent ; for he knew in flight</l>
     <l n="71">These Parthian warriors turn again and fight ;</l>
     <l n="72">He but at freedom , not at glory aim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="73">And only safety by his caution claim 'd .</l>
     <l n="74">Thus , when a great and powerful state decrees</l>
     <l n="75">Upon a small one , in its love , to seize -</l>
     <l n="76">It vows in kindness , to protect , defend ,</l>
     <l n="77">And be the fond ally , the faithful friend ;</l>
     <l n="78">It therefore wills that humbler state to place</l>
     <l n="79">Its hopes of safety in a fond embrace ;</l>
     <l n="80">Then must that humbler state its wisdom prove</l>
     <l n="81">By kind rejection of such pressing love ;</l>
     <l n="82">Must dread such dangerous friendship to commence ,</l>
     <l n="83">And stand collected in its own defence :</l>
     <l n="84">Our Farmer thus the proffer 'd kindness fled ,</l>
     <l n="85">And shunn 'd the love that into bondage led .</l>
     <l n="86">The Widow failing , fresh besiegers came ,</l>
     <l n="87">To share the fate of this retiring dame :</l>
     <l n="88">And each foresaw a thousand ills attend</l>
     <l n="89">The man that fled from so discreet a friend ;</l>
     <l n="90">And pray 'd , kind soul ! that no event might make</l>
     <l n="91">The harden 'd heart of Farmer Jones to ache .</l>
     <l n="92">But he still govern 'd with resistless hand ,</l>
     <l n="93">And where he could not guide he would command :</l>
     <l n="94">With steady view , in course direct he steer 'd ,</l>
     <l n="95">And his fair daughters loved him , though they fear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="96">Each had her school , and as his wealth was known ,</l>
     <l n="97">Each had in time a household of her own .</l>
     <l n="98">The Boy indeed was at the Grandam 's side</l>
     <l n="99">Humour 'd and train 'd , her trouble and her pride :</l>
     <l n="100">Companions dear , with speech and spirits mild ,</l>
     <l n="101">The childish widow and the vapourish child ;</l>
     <l n="102">This nature prompts ; minds uninform 'd and weak</l>
     <l n="103">In such alliance ease and comfort seek :</l>
     <l n="104">Push 'd by the levity of youth aside ,</l>
     <l n="105">The cares of man , his humour , or his pride ,</l>
     <l n="106">They feel , in their defenceless state , allied ;</l>
     <l n="107">The child is pleased to meet regard from age ,</l>
     <l n="108">The old are pleased e'en children to engage ;</l>
     <l n="109">And all their wisdom , scorn 'd by proud mankind ,</l>
     <l n="110">They love to pour into the ductile mind ,</l>
     <l n="111">By its own weakness into error led ,</l>
     <l n="112">And by fond age with prejudices fed .</l>
     <l n="113">The Father , thankful for the good he had ,</l>
     <l n="114">Yet saw with pain a whining , timid Lad ;</l>
     <l n="115">Whom he instructing led through cultured fields ,</l>
     <l n="116">To show what Man performs , what Nature yields :</l>
     <l n="117">But Stephen , listless , wander 'd from the view ,</l>
     <l n="118">From beasts he fled , for butterflies he flew ,</l>
     <l n="119">And idly gazed about in search of something new .</l>
     <l n="120">The lambs indeed he loved , and wish 'd to play</l>
     <l n="121">With things so mild , so harmless , and so gay ;</l>
     <l n="122">Best pleased the weakest of the flock to see ,</l>
     <l n="123">With whom he felt a sickly sympathy .</l>
     <l n="124">Meantime the Dame was anxious , day and night ,</l>
     <l n="125">To guide the notions of her babe aright ,</l>
     <l n="126">And on the favourite mind to throw her glimmering light ;</l>
     <l n="127">Her Bible-stories she impress 'd betimes ,</l>
     <l n="128">And fill 'd his head with hymns and holy rhymes ;</l>
     <l n="129">On powers unseen , the good and ill , she dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="130">And the poor Boy mysterious terrors felt ;</l>
     <l n="131">From frightful dreams he waking sobb 'd in dread ,</l>
     <l n="132">Till the good lady came to guard his bed .</l>
     <l n="133">The Father wish 'd such errors to correct ,</l>
     <l n="134">But let them pass in duty and respect :</l>
     <l n="135">But more it grieved his worthy mind to see</l>
     <l n="136">That Stephen never would a farmer be :</l>
     <l n="137">In vain he tried the shiftless Lad to guide ,</l>
     <l n="138">And yet ‘ twas time that something should be tried :</l>
     <l n="139">He at the village-school perchance might gain</l>
     <l n="140">All that such mind could gather and retain ;</l>
     <l n="141">Yet the good Dame affirm 'd her favourite child</l>
     <l n="142">Was apt and studious , though sedate and mild ;</l>
     <l n="143">“ That he on many a learned point could speak ,</l>
     <l n="144">And that his body , not his mind , was weak . ”</l>
     <l n="145">The Father doubted — but to school was sent</l>
     <l n="146">The timid Stephen , weeping as he went :</l>
     <l n="147">There the rude lads compell 'd the child to fight ,</l>
     <l n="148">And sent him bleeding to his home at night ;</l>
     <l n="149">At this the Grandam more indulgent grew ;</l>
     <l n="150">And bade her Darling “ shun the beastly crew ,</l>
     <l n="151">Whom Satan ruled , and who were sure to lie</l>
     <l n="152">Howling in torments , when they came to die . ”</l>
     <l n="153">This was such comfort , that in high disdain</l>
     <l n="154">He told their fate , and felt their blows again :</l>
     <l n="155">Yet if the Boy had not a hero 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="156">Within the school he play 'd a better part ;</l>
     <l n="157">He wrote a clean fine hand , and at his slate</l>
     <l n="158">With more success than many a hero sate ;</l>
     <l n="159">He thought not much indeed — but what depends</l>
     <l n="160">On pains and care was at his fingers ’ ends .</l>
     <l n="161">This had his Father 's praise , who now espied</l>
     <l n="162">A spark of merit , with a blaze of pride ;</l>
     <l n="163">And though a farmer he would never make ,</l>
     <l n="164">He might a pen with some advantage take ;</l>
     <l n="165">And as a clerk that instrument employ ,</l>
     <l n="166">So well adapted to a timid boy .</l>
     <l n="167">A London Cousin soon a place obtain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="168">Easy but humble — little could be gain 'd :</l>
     <l n="169">The time arrived when youth and age must part ,</l>
     <l n="170">Tears in each eye , and sorrow in each heart ;</l>
     <l n="171">The careful Father bade his Son attend</l>
     <l n="172">To all his duties and obey his Friend ;</l>
     <l n="173">To keep his church and there behave aright ,</l>
     <l n="174">As one existing in his Maker 's sight ,</l>
     <l n="175">Till acts to habits led , and duty to delight .</l>
     <l n="176">“ Then try , my boy , as quickly as you can ,</l>
     <l n="177">T'assume the looks and spirit of a man ;</l>
     <l n="178">I say , be honest , faithful , civil , true ,</l>
     <l n="179">And this you may , and yet have courage too :</l>
     <l n="180">Heroic men , their country 's boast and pride ,</l>
     <l n="181">Have fear 'd their God , and nothing fear 'd beside ;</l>
     <l n="182">While others daring , yet imbecile , fly</l>
     <l n="183">The power of man , and that of God defy :</l>
     <l n="184">Be manly , then , though mild , for , sure as fate ,</l>
     <l n="185">Thou art , my Stephen , too effeminate ;</l>
     <l n="186">Here , take my purse , and make a worthy use</l>
     <l n="187">( ‘ Tis fairly stock 'd ) of what it will produce :</l>
     <l n="188">And now my blessing , not as any charm</l>
     <l n="189">Or conjuration ; but ‘ twill do no harm . ”</l>
     <l n="190">Stephen , whose thoughts were wandering up and down ,</l>
     <l n="191">Now charm 'd with promised sights in London-town ,</l>
     <l n="192">Now loth to leave his Grandam — lost the force ,</l>
     <l n="193">The drift and tenor of this grave discourse ;</l>
     <l n="194">But , in a general way , he understood</l>
     <l n="195">‘ Twas good advice , and meant , “ My son be good ; ”</l>
     <l n="196">And Stephen knew that all such precepts mean</l>
     <l n="197">That lads should read their Bible , and be clean .</l>
     <l n="198">The good old Lady , though in some distress ,</l>
     <l n="199">Begg 'd her dear Stephen would his grief suppress :</l>
     <l n="200">“ Nay , dry those eyes , my child — and , first of all .</l>
     <l n="201">Hold fast thy faith , whatever may befall : ’</l>
     <l n="202">Hear the best preacher , and preserve the text</l>
     <l n="203">For meditation till you hear the next ;</l>
     <l n="204">Within your Bible night and morning look -</l>
     <l n="205">There is your duty , read no other book ;</l>
     <l n="206">Be not in crowds , in broils , in riots seen ,</l>
     <l n="207">And keep your conscience and your linen clean :</l>
     <l n="208">Be you a Joseph , and the time may be</l>
     <l n="209">When kings and rulers will be ruled by thee . ”</l>
     <l n="210">“ Nay , ” said the Father — “ Hush , my son ! ” replied</l>
     <l n="211">The Dame — “ the Scriptures must not be denied . ”</l>
     <l n="212">The Lad , still weeping , heard the wheels approach ,</l>
     <l n="213">And took his place within the evening coach ,</l>
     <l n="214">With heart quite rent asunder : on one side</l>
     <l n="215">Was love , and grief , and fear , for scenes untried ;</l>
     <l n="216">Wild beasts and wax-work fill 'd the happier part</l>
     <l n="217">Of Stephen 's varying and divided heart :</l>
     <l n="218">This he betray 'd by sighs and questions strange ,</l>
     <l n="219">Of famous shows , the Tower , and the Exchange .</l>
     <l n="220">Soon at his desk was placed the curious Boy ,</l>
     <l n="221">Demure and silent at his new employ ;</l>
     <l n="222">Yet as he could he much attention paid</l>
     <l n="223">To all around him , cautious and afraid ;</l>
     <l n="224">On older Clerks his eager eyes were fix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="225">But Stephen never in their council mix 'd :</l>
     <l n="226">Much their contempt he fear 'd , for if like them ,</l>
     <l n="227">He felt assured he should himself contemn ;</l>
     <l n="228">“ Oh ! they were all so eloquent , so free ,</l>
     <l n="229">No ! he was nothing — nothing could he be :</l>
     <l n="230">They dress so smartly , and so boldly look ,</l>
     <l n="231">And talk as if they read it from a book ;</l>
     <l n="232">But I , ” said Stephen , “ will forbear to speak ,</l>
     <l n="233">And they will think me prudent and not weak .</l>
     <l n="234">They talk , the instant they have dropp 'd the pen ,</l>
     <l n="235">Of singing-women and of acting-men :</l>
     <l n="236">Of plays and places where at night they walk</l>
     <l n="237">Beneath the lamps , and with the ladies talk ;</l>
     <l n="238">While other ladies for their pleasure sing , -</l>
     <l n="239">Oh ! ‘ tis a glorious and a happy thing :</l>
     <l n="240">They would despise me , did they understand</l>
     <l n="241">I dare not look upon a scene so grand ;</l>
     <l n="242">Or see the plays when critics rise and roar ,</l>
     <l n="243">And hiss and groan , and cry — Encore ! encore !</l>
     <l n="244">There 's one among them looks a little kind ;</l>
     <l n="245">If more encouraged , I would ope my mind . ”</l>
     <l n="246">Alas ! poor Stephen , happier had he kept</l>
     <l n="247">His purpose secret , while his envy slept !</l>
     <l n="248">Virtue perhaps had conquer 'd , or his shame</l>
     <l n="249">At least preserved him simple as he came .</l>
     <l n="250">A year elapsed before this Clerk began</l>
     <l n="251">To treat the rustic something like a man ;</l>
     <l n="252">He then in trifling points the youth advised ,</l>
     <l n="253">Talk 'd of his coat , and had it modernized ;</l>
     <l n="254">Or with the lad a Sunday-walk would take ,</l>
     <l n="255">And kindly strive his passions to awake ;</l>
     <l n="256">Meanwhile explaining all they heard and saw ,</l>
     <l n="257">Till Stephen stood in wonderment and awe ;</l>
     <l n="258">To a neat garden near the town they stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="259">Where the Lad felt delighted and afraid ;</l>
     <l n="260">There all he saw was smart , and fine , and fair -</l>
     <l n="261">He could but marvel how he ventured there :</l>
     <l n="262">Soon he observed , with terror and alarm ,</l>
     <l n="263">His friend enlocked within a Lady 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="264">And freely talking — “ But it is , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="265">“ A near relation , and that makes him free ; ”</l>
     <l n="266">And much amazed was Stephen when he knew</l>
     <l n="267">This was the first and only interview ;</l>
     <l n="268">Nay , had that lovely arm by him been seized ,</l>
     <l n="269">The lovely owner had been highly pleased .</l>
     <l n="270">“ Alas ! ” he sigh 'd , “ I never can contrive</l>
     <l n="271">At such bold , blessed freedoms to arrive ;</l>
     <l n="272">Never shall I such happy courage boast ,</l>
     <l n="273">I dare as soon encounter with a ghost . ”</l>
     <l n="274">Now to a play the friendly couple went ,</l>
     <l n="275">But the Boy murmurd at the money spent ;</l>
     <l n="276">“ He lov 'd , ” he said , “ to buy , but not to spend -</l>
     <l n="277">They only talk awhile , and there 's an end . ”</l>
     <l n="278">“ Come , you shall purchase books , ” the Friend replied ;</l>
     <l n="279">“ You are bewilder 'd , and you want a guide ;</l>
     <l n="280">To me refer the choice , and you shall find</l>
     <l n="281">The light break in upon your stagnant mind ! ”</l>
     <l n="282">The cooler Clerks exclaim 'd , “ In vain your art</l>
     <l n="283">To improve a cub without a head or heart ;</l>
     <l n="284">Rustics , though coarse , and savages , though wild ,</l>
     <l n="285">Our cares may render liberal and mild :</l>
     <l n="286">But what , my friend , can flow from all these pains ?</l>
     <l n="287">There is no dealing with a lack of brains . ”</l>
     <l n="288">“ True I am hopeless to behold him man ,</l>
     <l n="289">But let me make the booby what I can :</l>
     <l n="290">Though the rude stone no polish will display ,</l>
     <l n="291">Yet you may strip the rugged coat away . ”</l>
     <l n="292">Stephen beheld his books — “ I love to know</l>
     <l n="293">How money goes — now here is that to show :</l>
     <l n="294">And now ” he cried , “ I shall be pleased to get</l>
     <l n="295">Beyond the Bible — there I puzzle yet . ”</l>
     <l n="296">He spoke abash 'd — “ Nay , nay ! ” the friend replied ,</l>
     <l n="297">“ You need not lay the good old book aside ;</l>
     <l n="298">Antique and curious , I myself indeed</l>
     <l n="299">Read it at times , but as a man should read ;.</l>
     <l n="300">A fine old work it is , and I protest</l>
     <l n="301">I hate to hear it treated as a jest :</l>
     <l n="302">The book has wisdom in it , if you look</l>
     <l n="303">Wisely upon it , as another book :</l>
     <l n="304">For superstition ( as our priests of sin</l>
     <l n="305">Are pleased to tell us ) makes us blind within ;</l>
     <l n="306">Of this hereafter — we will now select</l>
     <l n="307">Some works to please you , others to direct ;</l>
     <l n="308">Tales and romances shall your fancy feed ,</l>
     <l n="309">And reasoners form your morals and your creed . ”</l>
     <l n="310">The books were view 'd , the price was fairly paid ,</l>
     <l n="311">And Stephen read undaunted , undismay 'd :</l>
     <l n="312">But not till first he papered all the row ,</l>
     <l n="313">And placed in order to enjoy the show :</l>
     <l n="314">Next letter 'd all the backs with care and speed ,</l>
     <l n="315">Set them in ranks , and then began to read .</l>
     <l n="316">The love of Order — I the thing receive</l>
     <l n="317">From reverend men , and I in part believe -</l>
     <l n="318">Shows a clear mind and clean , and whoso needs</l>
     <l n="319">This love , but seldom in the world succeeds ;</l>
     <l n="320">And yet with this some other love must be ,</l>
     <l n="321">Ere I can fully to the fact agree ;</l>
     <l n="322">Valour and study may by order gain ,</l>
     <l n="323">By order sovereigns hold more steady reign ;</l>
     <l n="324">Through all the tribes of nature order runs ,</l>
     <l n="325">And rules around in systems and in suns :</l>
     <l n="326">Still has the love of order found a place ,</l>
     <l n="327">With all that 's low , degrading , mean , and base ,</l>
     <l n="328">With all that merits scorn , and all that meets disgrace -</l>
     <l n="329">In the cold miser , of all change afraid ;</l>
     <l n="330">In pompous men in public seats obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="331">In humble placemen , heralds , solemn drones ,</l>
     <l n="332">Fanciers of flowers , and lads like Stephen Jones :</l>
     <l n="333">Order to these is armour and defence ,</l>
     <l n="334">And love of method serves in lack of sense .</l>
     <l n="335">For rustic youth could I a list produce</l>
     <l n="336">Of Stephen 's books , how great might be the use !</l>
     <l n="337">But evil fate was theirs — survey 'd , enjoy 'd</l>
     <l n="338">Some happy months , and then by force destroyed :</l>
     <l n="339">So will 'd the Fates — but these with patience read</l>
     <l n="340">Had vast effect on Stephen 's heart and head .</l>
     <l n="341">This soon appear 'd : within a single week</l>
     <l n="342">He oped his lips , and made attempt to speak ;</l>
     <l n="343">He fail 'd indeed — but still his Friend confess 'd</l>
     <l n="344">The best have fail 'd , and he had done his best :</l>
     <l n="345">The first of swimmers , when at first he swims ,</l>
     <l n="346">Has little use or freedom in his limbs ;</l>
     <l n="347">Nay , when at length he strikes with manly force ,</l>
     <l n="348">The cramp may seize him , and impede his course .</l>
     <l n="349">Encouraged thus , our Clerk again essay 'd</l>
     <l n="350">The daring act , though daunted and afraid :</l>
     <l n="351">Succeeding now , though partial his success ,</l>
     <l n="352">And pertness mark 'd his manner and address ,</l>
     <l n="353">Yet such improvement issued from his books ,</l>
     <l n="354">That all discern 'd it in his speech and looks :</l>
     <l n="355">He ventured then on every theme to speak ,</l>
     <l n="356">And felt no feverish tingling in his cheek ;</l>
     <l n="357">His friend , approving , hail 'd the happy change ,</l>
     <l n="358">The Clerks exclaim 'd — “ ‘ Tis famous , and ‘ tis strange . ”</l>
     <l n="359">Two years had pass 'd ; the Youth attended still</l>
     <l n="360">( Though thus accomplish 'd ) with a ready quill :</l>
     <l n="361">He sat th ’ allotted hours , though hard the case ,</l>
     <l n="362">While timid prudence ruled in virtue 's place ;</l>
     <l n="363">By promise bound , the Son his letters penn 'd</l>
     <l n="364">To his good parent at the quarter 's end .</l>
     <l n="365">At first he sent those lines , the state to tell</l>
     <l n="366">Of his own health , and hoped his friends were well ;</l>
     <l n="367">He kept their virtuous precepts in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="368">And needed nothing — then his name was sign 'd :</l>
     <l n="369">But now he wrote of Sunday-walks and views ,</l>
     <l n="370">Of actors ’ names , choice novels , and strange news ;</l>
     <l n="371">How coats were cut , and of his urgent need</l>
     <l n="372">For fresh supply , which he desired with speed .</l>
     <l n="373">The Father doubted , when these letters came ,</l>
     <l n="374">To what they tended , yet was loth to blame :</l>
     <l n="375">“ Stephen was once my duteous son , and now</l>
     <l n="376">My most obedient — this can I allow ?</l>
     <l n="377">Can I with pleasure or with patience see</l>
     <l n="378">A boy at once so heartless and so free ? ”</l>
     <l n="379">But soon the kinsman heavy tidings told ,</l>
     <l n="380">That love and prudence could no more withhold :</l>
     <l n="381">“ Stephen , though steady at his desk , was grown</l>
     <l n="382">A rake and coxcomb — this he grieved to own ;</l>
     <l n="383">His cousin left his church , and spent the day</l>
     <l n="384">Lounging about in quite a heathen way ;</l>
     <l n="385">Sometimes he swore , but had indeed the grace</l>
     <l n="386">To show the shame imprinted on his face :</l>
     <l n="387">I search 'd his room , and in his absence read</l>
     <l n="388">Books that I knew would turn a stronger head .</l>
     <l n="389">The works of atheists half the number made ,</l>
     <l n="390">The rest were lives of harlots leaving trade ;</l>
     <l n="391">Which neither man nor boy would deign to read ,</l>
     <l n="392">If from the scandal and pollution freed :</l>
     <l n="393">I sometimes threaten 'd , and would fairly state</l>
     <l n="394">My sense of things so vile and profligate ;</l>
     <l n="395">But I 'm a cit , such works are lost on me -</l>
     <l n="396">They 're knowledge , and ( good Lord ! ) philosophy . ”</l>
     <l n="397">“ Oh , send him down , ” the Father soon replied ;</l>
     <l n="398">Let me behold him , and my skill be tried :</l>
     <l n="399">If care and kindness lose their wonted use ,</l>
     <l n="400">Some rougher medicine will the end produce . ”</l>
     <l n="401">Stephen with grief and anger heard his doom -</l>
     <l n="402">“ Go to the farmer ? to the rustic 's home ?</l>
     <l n="403">Curse the base threat'ning — ” “ Nay , child , never curse ;</l>
     <l n="404">Corrupted long , your case is growing worse . ”</l>
     <l n="405">“ I ! ” quoth the youth ; “ I challenge all mankind</l>
     <l n="406">To find a fault ; what fault have you to find ?</l>
     <l n="407">Improve I not in manner , speech , and grace ?</l>
     <l n="408">Inquire — my friends will tell it to your face ;</l>
     <l n="409">Have I been taught to guard his kine and sheep ?</l>
     <l n="410">A man like me has other things to keep ;</l>
     <l n="411">This let him know . ” — “ It would his wrath excite :</l>
     <l n="412">But come , prepare , you must away to-night . ”</l>
     <l n="413">“ What ! leave my studies , my improvements leave ,</l>
     <l n="414">My faithful friends and intimates to grieve ? ”</l>
     <l n="415">“ Go to your father , Stephen , let him see</l>
     <l n="416">All these improvements ; they are lost on me . ”</l>
     <l n="417">The Youth , though loth , obey 'd , and soon he saw</l>
     <l n="418">The Farmer-father , with some signs of awe ;</l>
     <l n="419">Who , kind , yet silent , waited to behold</l>
     <l n="420">How one would act , so daring , yet so cold :</l>
     <l n="421">And soon he found , between the friendly pair</l>
     <l n="422">That secrets pass 'd which he was not to share ;</l>
     <l n="423">But he resolved those secrets to obtain ,</l>
     <l n="424">And quash rebellion in his lawful reign .</l>
     <l n="425">Stephen , though vain , was with his father mute ;</l>
     <l n="426">He fear 'd a crisis , and he shunn 'd dispute ;</l>
     <l n="427">And yet he long 'd with youthful pride to show</l>
     <l n="428">He knew such things as farmers could not know ;</l>
     <l n="429">These to the Grandam he with freedom spoke ,</l>
     <l n="430">Saw her amazement , and enjoy 'd the joke :</l>
     <l n="431">But on the father when he cast his eye ,</l>
     <l n="432">Something he found that made his valour shy ;</l>
     <l n="433">And thus there seem 'd to be a hollow truce ,</l>
     <l n="434">Still threat'ning something dismal to produce .</l>
     <l n="435">Ere this the Father at his leisure read</l>
     <l n="436">The son 's choice volumes , and his wonder fled ;</l>
     <l n="437">He saw how wrought the works of either kind</l>
     <l n="438">On so presuming , yet so weak a mind ;</l>
     <l n="439">These in a chosen hour he made his prey ,</l>
     <l n="440">Condemn 'd , and bore with vengeful thoughts away ;</l>
     <l n="441">Then in a close recess the couple near ,</l>
     <l n="442">He sat unseen to see , unheard to hear .</l>
     <l n="443">There soon a trial for his patience came ;</l>
     <l n="444">Beneath were placed the Youth and ancient Dame ,</l>
     <l n="445">Each on a purpose fix 'd — but neither thought</l>
     <l n="446">How near a foe , with power and vengeance fraught .</l>
     <l n="447">And now the matron told , as tidings sad ,</l>
     <l n="448">What she had heard of her beloved lad ;</l>
     <l n="449">How he to graceless , wicked men gave heed ,</l>
     <l n="450">And wicked books would night and morning read ;</l>
     <l n="451">Some former lectures she again began ,</l>
     <l n="452">And begg 'd attention of her little man ;</l>
     <l n="453">She brought , with many a pious boast , in view</l>
     <l n="454">His former studies , and condemn 'd the new :</l>
     <l n="455">Once he the names of saints and patriarchs old ,</l>
     <l n="456">Judges and kings , and chiefs and prophets , told ;</l>
     <l n="457">Then he in winter-nights the Bible took ,</l>
     <l n="458">To count how often in the sacred book</l>
     <l n="459">The sacred name appear 'd , and could rehearse</l>
     <l n="460">Which were the middle chapter , word , and verse ,</l>
     <l n="461">The very letter in the middle placed ,</l>
     <l n="462">And so employ 'd the hours that others waste .</l>
     <l n="463">“ Such wert thou once ; and now , my child , they say</l>
     <l n="464">Thy faith like water runneth fast away ,</l>
     <l n="465">The prince of devils hath , I fear , beguiled</l>
     <l n="466">The ready wit of my backsliding child . ”</l>
     <l n="467">On this , with lofty looks , our Clerk began</l>
     <l n="468">His grave rebuke , as he assumed the man . -</l>
     <l n="469">“ There is no devil , ” said the hopeful youth ,</l>
     <l n="470">“ Nor prince of devils : that I know for truth .</l>
     <l n="471">Have I not told you how my books describe</l>
     <l n="472">The arts of priests , and all the canting tribe ?</l>
     <l n="473">Your Bible mentions Egypt , where it seems</l>
     <l n="474">Was Joseph found when Pharoah dream 'd his dreams :</l>
     <l n="475">Now in that place , in some bewilder 'd head ,</l>
     <l n="476">( The learned write ) religious dreams were bred ;</l>
     <l n="477">Whence through the earth , with various forms combined ,</l>
     <l n="478">They came to frighten and afflict mankind ,</l>
     <l n="479">Prone ( so I read ) to let a priest invade</l>
     <l n="480">Their souls with awe , and by his craft be made</l>
     <l n="481">Slave to his will , and profit to his trade :</l>
     <l n="482">So say my books , and how the rogues agreed</l>
     <l n="483">To blind the victims , to defraud and lead ;</l>
     <l n="484">When joys above to ready dupes were sold ,</l>
     <l n="485">And hell was threaten 'd to the shy and cold .</l>
     <l n="486">“ Why so amazed , and so prepared to pray ?</l>
     <l n="487">As if a Being heard a word we say :</l>
     <l n="488">This may surprise you ; I myself began</l>
     <l n="489">To feel disturb 'd , and to my Bible ran :</l>
     <l n="490">I now am wiser — yet agree in this ,</l>
     <l n="491">The book has things that are not much amiss ;</l>
     <l n="492">It is a fine old work , and I protest</l>
     <l n="493">I hate to hear it treated as a jest :</l>
     <l n="494">The book has wisdom in it , if you look</l>
     <l n="495">Wisely upon it as another book . ”</l>
     <l n="496">“ Oh ! wicked ! wicked ! my unhappy child ,</l>
     <l n="497">How hast thou been by evil men beguiled ! ”</l>
     <l n="498">“ How ! wicked , say you ? You can little guess</l>
     <l n="499">The gain of that which you call wickedness ;</l>

     <l n="517">On side and shoulder , quick as mill-wheels broke ;</l>
     <l n="518">Quick as the patient 's pulse , who trembling cried ,</l>

     <l n="520">Till all the medicine he prepared was dealt ,</l>

     <l n="522">Till all the panting flesh was red and raw ,</l>

   <p>{ 2 } The reader will perceive , in these and the preceding verses , allusions to the state of France , as that country was circumstanced some years since , rather than as it appears to be in the present date ; several years elapsing between the alarm of the loyal magistrate on the occasion now related , and a subsequent event that further illustrates the remark with which the narrative commences .</p>
   <p>{ 3 } As the author 's purpose in this tale may be mistaken , he wishes to observe that conduct like that of the lady 's here described must be meritorious or consurable just as the motives to it are pure or selfish ; that these motives may in a great measure be concealed from the mind of the agent ; and that we often take credit to our virtue for actions which spring originally from our tempers , inclinations , or our indifference . It cannot therefore be improper , much less immoral , to give an instance of such self-deception .</p>
