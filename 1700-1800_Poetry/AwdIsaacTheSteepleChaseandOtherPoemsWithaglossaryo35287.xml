    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The Author of the following Poems prefixes a “ Preface ” to them , lest he should seem to be wanting in respect to his readers , did he not comply with a custom which is universal . In doing so , however , he would eschew two kinds of Preface , viz : that in which the author arrogates to himself the merit of having produced a work entirely new , both in subject , and in manner of expression , and on that score claims the plaudits of his friends and the public ;— and that in which the author professes to feel himself inadequate to the task of composing a book , but at the pressing solicitation of his friends , with great distrust of his abilities for such a work , he yields to their entreaties , and pleads his inability in mitigation of the critic 's wrath . With respect to the former , the writer of the present volume professes not to offer to his readers any thing new , either as to matter , or to language ; and as to the latter , the following pieces were most of them composed several years ago , at distant intervals of time , and were frequently perused by his friends long before he had thoughts of publishing them :— the character of his poetry is therefore pretty well known to those who are likely to become purchasers of his book ; and it would be but a bungling apology did he attempt to shelter its defects under the plea of inability for his task .</p>
    <p n="2">It will be unnecessary to say much of the subjects sung of in the following poems . Though they are various , the author hopes they will all be found to contain a moral , which , if acted upon in common life , would direct the conduct to a beneficial end . Many of them are founded on facts which occurred in the writer 's neighbourhood , and which he has endeavoured to turn to a useful purpose . Others are of an experimental cast , and are the breathings of the poet 's heart when inflamed by Love Divine ! It has been his constant aim to exhibit the workings of grace in the heart , its effects on the life , and the glorious futurity to which it conducts its possessor . For this purpose , he has seized on a variety of incidents known to many of his friends , which have furnished him with matter on which to graft a spiritual thought . Life in its spring tide , or when ebbing in death , home with its simple yet hallowed joys , a religious assembly rapt in devotion and love , a landscape endeared by the associations of youth or of kindred , a dilapidated church , a withering flower , a text of scripture — have supplied him with topics ;— and he trusts that the doctrines which he has inculcated in connection with them will always be found to agree with the Word of God .</p>
    <p n="3">Of the “ Dialect ” in which some of the pieces are composed , the author deems it necessary to say a few words . It is well known that every county in England has its peculiarities of expression and pronunciation . These peculiarities , though often unintelligible to persons brought up at a distance , are yet the native language of the common inhabitants ; and there is , in their estimation , a point and power in them , which are not to be found in more polished periods . The author has availed himself of the dialect of his native county to convey to a particular class of persons some important truths , which may , perhaps , be more welcomely received because clad in that garb . There may , indeed , appear to delicate ears , a rudeness approaching to barbarism , in the dialect which he has employed ; but what is wanting in polish , will , in the estimation of those for whom he writes , be more than compensated by force and vigour . Truth is truth — however humble the habiliments in which it is dressed : nor does it come with less power to the heart because conveyed in language with which those for whom it was intended are familiar . Indeed , there is in that very familiarity something which arrests the attention and affects the heart . Of the correctness of this view , the author has many times seen proof , in the interest with which some of the pieces in the dialect have been listened to , by persons whose education being limited they could not perhaps have appreciated the beauties of polished verse , but were at once arrested and delighted when the artless tale was narrated in their mother tongue . To make this part of the work as complete as possible , great care has been used to render the orthography correct : published specimens of the Dialect have been consulted , as well as living authorities , and no pains have been spared that could contribute to make it complete both to the eye and to the ear . A difference of orthography may occasionally appear , caused by the necessity of making a rhyme ;— excepting a few rare instances of this kind , a standard has been adopted which has not been departed from . For the assistance of those who are unacquainted with the dialect of the North Riding of Yorkshire , a copious glossary is appended to the work , by reference to which the meaning of any unknown term or phrase will at once be seen .</p>
    <p n="4">The author prays that the blessing of God may accompany his work !</p>

    <head>LEALHOLM BRIDGE .</head>
    <head>A SOLILOQUY DURING A VISIT , AFTER SOME YEARS ’ ABSENCE .</head>
     <l n="1">Ah , lovely Lealholm ! Where shall I begin ,</l>
     <l n="2">To say what thou art now , and once hast been ?</l>
     <l n="3">Once the dear seat of all my earthly joys ,</l>
     <l n="4">That now , in recollection only , rise !</l>
     <l n="5">Methinks , where'er I look no life appears ,</l>
     <l n="6">But all the place a cheerless aspect wears ;</l>
     <l n="7">Thy groves are desolate , thy swains are fled ,</l>
     <l n="8">And many of them number 'd with the dead ;</l>
     <l n="9">Religion ‘ s cold , the poor are sore oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">Thy orphans weep , and widows are distress 'd .</l>
     <l n="11">O let us pray their griefs may shortly end ,</l>
     <l n="12">And God , their Father , still may prove their friend .</l>
     <l n="13">This ancient Bridge some faint idea brings ,</l>
     <l n="14">Where still the swallow comes and dips her wings ;</l>
     <l n="15">The murmuring river , and the rumbling mill ,</l>
     <l n="16">Bear some resemblance to poor Lealholm still ;</l>
     <l n="17">Yon silent whirlpool beautifies the scene ,</l>
     <l n="18">Where shades of trees are in its deepness seen ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where leaping fishes on the surface play ,</l>
     <l n="20">And gladly seems to close , the summer 's day ;</l>
     <l n="21">The broken waters from yon glen resound ,</l>
     <l n="22">Their constant rippling ‘ s heard the village round ;</l>
     <l n="23">Yon burden 'd iron pinion loudly shrieks ,</l>
     <l n="24">While tears of oil hang on his rusty cheeks ;</l>
     <l n="25">The greedy race , the water still supplies ,</l>
     <l n="26">The lofty wheel 's broad shelves successive rise ;</l>
     <l n="27">The thund'ring engine doth her hands employ ,</l>
     <l n="28">And Hunter 's place is fill 'd by William Joy ;</l>
     <l n="29">The floating bubble swims upon the wave ,</l>
     <l n="30">While Ord [ B ] lies mould'ring in the silent grave ;</l>
     <l n="31">Behind yon hill the sun escapes from sight ,</l>
     <l n="32">And yields his empire to the shades of night .</l>
     <l n="33">Alas ! Poor Lealholm once in glory shone ,</l>
     <l n="34">But now , she like a widow , sits alone !</l>
     <l n="35">Once from yon town the people flock 'd like bees ,</l>
     <l n="36">To taste the sweetness of the country breeze ;</l>
     <l n="37">Pedestrians joyful , here and there were seen ,</l>
     <l n="38">While shays and whiskeys deck 'd her level green ;</l>
     <l n="39">The banks of Esk , were crowded all along ,</l>
     <l n="40">Either with Anglers , or with lookers on .</l>
     <l n="41">The full “ Moon ,"[ C ] then did through her valleys shine ,</l>
     <l n="42">So bright , some thought she never would decline ;</l>
     <l n="43">Year after year she in her sphere did move ,</l>
     <l n="44">And all seem 'd animation , life , and love :</l>
     <l n="45">But now , in mists and gloom she disappears ,</l>
     <l n="46">Eclips 'd — her light no longer Lealholm cheers !</l>
     <l n="47">Pluck 'd from her orb , her borrow 'd lustre 's fled ,</l>
     <l n="48">And in the silent tomb , she rests her head .</l>
     <l n="49">In distant lands my father 's lot was cast ,</l>
     <l n="50">And we were left to feel the bitter blast .</l>
     <l n="51">Death 's fatal hand its victim did arrest ,</l>
     <l n="52">And tore him from the darlings of his breast .</l>
     <l n="53">I , by a mother 's care , when young was led ,</l>
     <l n="54">Down by the river to yon primrose bed ,</l>
     <l n="55">Where birds so sweetly sung the trees among ,</l>
     <l n="56">I thought those days were happy , bright , and long .</l>
     <l n="57">Oft I , a boy , with others of my age ,</l>
     <l n="58">Did eager here in youthful sports engage .</l>
     <l n="59">Oft in yon wood we rov 'd when life was new ,</l>
     <l n="60">The rocks , and trees and rugged caves to view ;</l>
     <l n="61">Where woodbines wild , with sweets perfum 'd the air ,</l>
     <l n="62">And all seem 'd joyous , beautiful , and fair .</l>
     <l n="63">Alas ! where 's now the grove ? The trees are gone !</l>
     <l n="64">And many the wide ocean are upon :</l>
     <l n="65">A few remaining springers yet survive ,</l>
     <l n="66">And keep their owner 's name and place alive !</l>
     <l n="67">Just so it is with us , could we but see ,</l>
     <l n="68">Our fathers who are in eternity !</l>
     <l n="69">Their offspring live , but they 're for ever gone ,</l>
     <l n="70">Their portion 's fixed , no more will they return !</l>
     <l n="71">May we be wise , and lessons learn afresh ,</l>
     <l n="72">To trust no longer in an arm of flesh !—</l>
     <l n="73">Begin to seek , and rest not till we find</l>
     <l n="74">The peace of God , which satisfies the mind .</l>
     <l n="75">Then seeing all my earthly joys are fled ,</l>
     <l n="76">Where , O my soul ! art thou for succour led ?</l>
     <l n="77">‘ Tis Jesus , that can all thy wants supply ,</l>
     <l n="78">A fountain ‘ s there which never will run dry :</l>
     <l n="79">Arabia 's grove , nor Sharon 's flowery field ,</l>
     <l n="80">Such rich perfume , such holy incense yield :</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tis Jesus ’ merit , and his dying love ,</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Tis these perfume the glorious courts above !</l>

     <l n="6">Attend , while I a simple tale relate .</l>
     <l n="7">A preacher being to a village sent ,</l>
     <l n="8">To warn and woo the people to repent ;</l>
     <l n="9">Depending only on God 's mighty grace ,</l>
     <l n="10">His pious soul was looking for success .</l>
     <l n="11">For God , his people had a house prepared ,</l>
     <l n="12">In which his arm had many times been bared ,</l>
     <l n="13">And in that little village congregation ,</l>
     <l n="14">Were found some earnest seekers of salvation .</l>
     <l n="15">Among the rest a noted Bruiser stood ,</l>
     <l n="16">Whose hands had oft been stain 'd with human blood ;</l>
     <l n="17">A man of constitution so robust ,</l>
     <l n="18">He oft had laid Goliaths in the dust .</l>
     <l n="19">He fully on the preacher fix 'd his eye ,</l>
     <l n="20">But scarcely could declare the reason why ;</l>
     <l n="21">The subject , and the theme on which he dwelt ,</l>
     <l n="22">Caught his attention , and its force he felt .</l>
     <l n="23">He thought the preacher all his actions knew ,</l>
     <l n="24">His words , like arrows , pierc 'd his conscience through ;</l>
     <l n="25">His spirits fell , his heart was sick and sore ,</l>
     <l n="26">Such anguish he had never felt before .</l>
     <l n="27">It seem 'd to him as if an angel spoke ,</l>
     <l n="28">He felt within as if his heart was broke ,</l>
     <l n="29">He thought he heard mount Sinai 's thunder roll ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which shook the very centre of his soul !</l>
     <l n="31">Such mighty strokes soon humbled all his pride ,</l>
     <l n="32">He sank condemn 'd , and loud for mercy cried .</l>
     <l n="33">“ What shall I do ? ” said he , “ Nay , who can tell ?</l>
     <l n="34">Oh ! how shall I escape the pit of Hell ? ”</l>
     <l n="35">On bended knees he did salvation seek ,</l>
     <l n="36">Big tears roll 'd down his long undaunted cheek :—</l>
     <l n="37">The people pray 'd , the sinner wept the more ,—</l>
     <l n="38">This man , who till that hour , ne'er wept before .</l>
     <l n="39">After a time his mighty anguish ceas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="40">The Lord of life his captive soul releas 'd !</l>
     <l n="41">The joy he felt he scarcely could contain ,</l>
     <l n="42">The people sung — “ a sinner 's born again ! ”</l>
     <l n="43">Some time elaps 'd — two of his mates had met ,</l>
     <l n="44">As custom was , and in a tavern sat ,</l>
     <l n="45">Conversing on events that daily pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">Till one the other thus address 'd at last .</l>
     <l n="47">“ Heard you not what occurred the other day ?</l>
     <l n="48">Old Sam has been converted , people say ! ”</l>
     <l n="49">“ Old Sam ! ” the other says , with great surprise ,</l>
     <l n="50">“ What Sam , the Boxer ? ” “ Yes ! ” the other cries !</l>
     <l n="51">“ Depend upo n't , though you may think it strange ,</l>
     <l n="52">But in old Sam there is a wondrous change ! ”</l>
     <l n="53">“ Nay ,— he converted ! Pshaw ! ‘ tis all a whim ;</l>
     <l n="54">They 've just as much converted me as him ;</l>
     <l n="55">And I can find a man , I have no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="56">That soon will beat all his religion out . ”</l>
     <l n="57">“ Perhaps not so , ” the other softly said ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ I think Old Sam ‘ s of better mettle made ,</l>
     <l n="59">I know that he was always bad to bend ,</l>
     <l n="60">And on his firmness I will still depend . ”</l>
     <l n="61">The other rose , and would a wager bet ,</l>
     <l n="62">Old Sam was not so far converted yet ,</l>
     <l n="63">But that if pick 'd at , he would turn again ,</l>
     <l n="64">And still he would the bloody cause maintain .</l>
     <l n="65">To Sammy 's door their way direct they took ,</l>
     <l n="66">For he had now the tavern 's haunts forsook ;</l>
     <l n="67">They call 'd a rebel out to lead the van ,</l>
     <l n="68">To vex and aggravate the poor old man .</l>
     <l n="69">At length they reach 'd , and rattled at the door ,</l>
     <l n="70">Standing around , like lions to devour</l>
     <l n="71">His happy soul ; but he had by his side ,</l>
     <l n="72">King David 's faithful Shepherd for his guide .</l>
     <l n="73">Old Sammy from his Bible reading rose ,</l>
     <l n="74">And straightway forth to meet the rebel goes ;</l>
     <l n="75">“ Here 's one , ” say they , “ will fight for what you like ! ”</l>
     <l n="76">He stamp 'd , and raged , and dared old Sam to strike ;</l>
     <l n="77">Sam look 'd and smiled , as he before him stood ,</l>
     <l n="78">Then shook his head , thinking the cause not good ;</l>
     <l n="79">At length his flaming passion to control ,</l>
     <l n="80">He cries , “ The Lord have mercy on thy soul !</l>
     <l n="81">Thy case I pity , O thou man of might ,</l>
     <l n="82">Although this practice once was my delight ;</l>
     <l n="83">Calm thy fierce rage , and to old Sam attend ,</l>
     <l n="84">Before destruction prove thy awful end .</l>
     <l n="85">I clearly see the spirit thou art in ,</l>
     <l n="86">For I myself oft in the same have been ;</l>
     <l n="87">And many a one like thee I 've made to bend ,</l>
     <l n="88">And brought their boasting valour to an end .</l>
     <l n="89">‘ Tis well for thee that I 'm another man ,</l>
     <l n="90">Or thou wouldst rue the day that this began ;</l>
     <l n="91">I soon should settle all thy boasts and brags ,</l>
     <l n="92">And make thy bones fall rattling on the flags !</l>
     <l n="93">Thou mayst thank God , whose power and grace divine ,</l>
     <l n="94">Have chang 'd this proud , rebellious heart of mine ;</l>
     <l n="95">The love I feel to thee forbids the blow ,</l>
     <l n="96">Which soon would lay thy boasting prowess low .</l>
     <l n="97">Restrain thy passion , give old Sam thine hand ,</l>
     <l n="98">Be thankful that thou dost before him stand ;</l>
     <l n="99">Go tell the men whom once I did adore ,</l>
     <l n="100">Their wager 's lost , old Sam will fight no more ;</l>
     <l n="101">Tell them to save their money for their wives ,</l>
     <l n="102">Give up their folly , and reform their lives ;</l>
     <l n="103">To go and seek salvation while they may ,</l>
     <l n="104">Before the wrath of God drives them away ! ”</l>
     <l n="105">Sam 's noble speech so satisfied them all ,</l>
     <l n="106">That not one there durst him a coward call .</l>
     <l n="107">“ Although the wager ‘ s fairly lost , ” say they ,</l>
     <l n="108">“ We all must own old Sam hath won the day ! ”</l>
     <l n="109">Now Sammy like a warrior stout and bold ,</l>
     <l n="110">Seeks new companions , and forsakes the old ;</l>
     <l n="111">While shouts of praise his ravish 'd ears surround ,</l>
     <l n="112">He hears , and understands , the joyful sound !</l>
     <l n="113">Yes , Sammy has a better master now ,</l>
     <l n="114">And more substantial friends to deal with too ;</l>
     <l n="115">Secure he leans on his Redeemer 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="116">And sweetly sings himself away to rest .</l>

    <head>THOUGHTS ON GOOD FRIDAY :</head>
    <head>Occasioned by seeing two “ Sinkers ” dragged out of a Coal Pit ; one of them killed , the other dreadfully wounded . At a short distance , a busy crowd were preparing their tents and posts for the approaching races , on Easter Monday and Tuesday . On mentioning the fatal occurrence , and naming the day , a bystander exclaimed , “ O , Good Friday is nought ! ”</head>
     <l n="1">The morning sun shone dim , as if in pain ,</l>
     <l n="2">To see that day by man so soon despised .</l>
     <l n="3">The feather 'd choirs did heedless man reprove ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who had more cause than they , with early song</l>
     <l n="5">To greet the morn , on which their Saviour bled .</l>
     <l n="6">Alas ! that man should e'er forget his love !</l>
     <l n="7">Down , down the pit , the cheerful sinkers went ,</l>
     <l n="8">Nor grief , nor fear through all the gloom appear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="9">Though at the bottom deep , grim death sat shrouded</l>
     <l n="10">In horrid features , measuring their minutes !</l>
     <l n="11">Foul was the air , and bad ;— they saw him not ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor dream 'd he was so near , nor held dispute ,</l>
     <l n="13">On which the lot might fall , to be his victim :—</l>
     <l n="14">When suddenly , through wanton carelessness ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or the just judgment of an angry God ,</l>
     <l n="16">The kibble kick 'd , brim full of splinter 'd rock !</l>
     <l n="17">Down fell at once his ponderous instrument ,</l>
     <l n="18">Full thirty fathom , whizzing as it went !</l>
     <l n="19">Beneath its heavy crash a victim fell ,</l>
     <l n="20">And groan 'd , nor ceas 'd , till he had groan 'd his last .</l>
     <l n="21">Then from behind the scene the monster stept ,</l>
     <l n="22">And with his bony fingers hurl 'd his dart :</l>
     <l n="23">Its point another touch 'd , but not so deep .</l>
     <l n="24">Forth from the pit I saw the sufferers dragg 'd ,</l>
     <l n="25">I heard deep groans , and saw their mangled flesh .</l>
     <l n="26">The former then with grief was quick interr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="27">The other a poor halting cripple lives .</l>
     <l n="28">Where 's now the man that says “ Good Friday 's nought ? ”</l>
     <l n="29">With accidents like this , God 's swift judgments ,</l>
     <l n="30">I could , if ‘ twere requested , fill these sheets ;</l>
     <l n="31">But to the man who thinks , and judges right ,</l>
     <l n="32">This may suffice . And is Good Friday nought ?</l>
     <l n="33">Is that day nought on which our Saviour bled ,</l>
     <l n="34">To buy our pardon , to save by suff'ring !</l>
     <l n="35">Open salvation 's fount for crimson crimes ,</l>
     <l n="36">And wash , and make us guilty lepers clean ?</l>
     <l n="37">Alas for man ! He sees , he feels it not !</l>
     <l n="38">Of old , men saw , and felt it , though far off .</l>
     <l n="39">The martyrs saw , own 'd , and observ 'd it too ,</l>
     <l n="40">In fasting , prayer , and self-denial ;</l>
     <l n="41">This made them march , when call 'd , with holy joy ,</l>
     <l n="42">To meet the dagger 's point , or burning stake .</l>
     <l n="43">The earth once felt , and felt to her foundations ;</l>
     <l n="44">The marble mountain felt , and quak 'd , and shiver 'd ;</l>
     <l n="45">The sun felt , and grew dark ; the heavens wept ,</l>
     <l n="46">And hell beneath , in dismal groanings howl 'd !</l>
     <l n="47">The serpent felt ,— and still feels in his bruis 'd head .</l>
     <l n="48">The Saviour !— Yes , the King of Glory felt ,</l>
     <l n="49">In that sad cup his subjects should have drunk :—</l>
     <l n="50">Both in the temple , and the wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="51">The street , the judgment hall ,— in Pilate 's scourge ,</l>
     <l n="52">In cruel mockings , and the scarlet robe !</l>
     <l n="53">He felt it too beneath the rugged wood ,</l>
     <l n="54">When He fatigued climb 'd Calvary 's steep brow !</l>
     <l n="55">He felt it in the hammer and the nails</l>
     <l n="56">That pierc 'd his flesh , though he offended not !</l>
     <l n="57">He felt it in the reed , and crown of thorns !</l>
     <l n="58">He felt it in the hyssop , vinegar , and gall ,</l>
     <l n="59">In strange upbraidings , and the soldier 's spear !</l>
     <l n="60">He felt it in that mighty crush , which should ,</l>
     <l n="61">And would have crush 'd , his guilty murderers .</l>
     <l n="62">He felt it till his mortal part expir 'd !</l>
     <l n="63">He feels it yet , and so do his disciples :</l>
     <l n="64">But the proud stiff-neck 'd sinner feels it not ;—</l>
     <l n="65">Perverse , he will not , yet one day he shall !</l>
     <l n="66">Though he at present , feast and garnish out</l>
     <l n="67">His wife 's , or children 's birth days , and his own ,</l>
     <l n="68">With songs , and cards , and music , and the dance ,</l>
     <l n="69">Yet this , like Job 's day , shall be blotted out !</l>
     <l n="70">Though he will not , yet he shall regard it ,</l>
     <l n="71">When God appears in majesty , and power ,</l>
     <l n="72">Arm 'd with thunder-bolts , and chariots of fire ,</l>
     <l n="73">On all his foes to pour his vengeance !</l>
     <l n="74">Yes ! All men then will wish to be his friends .</l>
     <l n="75">E'en those who have his words and grace despis 'd ,</l>
     <l n="76">Will wish their lives were to begin again !—</l>
     <l n="77">“ Whither , O , whither shall the guilty flee ,</l>
     <l n="78">When consternation turns the good man pale ! ”</l>

     <l n="5">To manifest to us his Father 's love !</l>

     <l n="43">And when , and where they enter 'd mercy 's gate .</l>
     <l n="44">They tell us how their eyes with tears did fill ,</l>
     <l n="45">When unbelief was wilful of its will .</l>
     <l n="46">They tell us how their sins did them oppress ,</l>
     <l n="47">And fill 'd their inmost souls with deep distress ;</l>
     <l n="48">And how the Lord their burden did remove ,</l>

     <l n="51">To hear each prospers in the work of grace .</l>
     <l n="52">With one consent their cheerful hearts aspire ,</l>

     <l n="58">Both far and near his Kingdom doth extend ,</l>
     <l n="59">Temples are rising both by sea and land .</l>
     <l n="60">The Bethel flag , high waving in the air ,</l>
     <l n="61">Calls seamen to engage in praise and prayer ,</l>
     <l n="62">Whole streets , reform 'd , the great assembly join ,</l>
     <l n="63">Speak with new tongues , and sing in songs divine .</l>
     <l n="64">Poor trembling sinners wipe their watery eyes ,</l>

     <l n="66">Blasphemers fall beneath the power of God ,</l>
     <l n="67">And statesmen flock to hear his Holy Word ;</l>
     <l n="68">While some of them a portion find to spare ,</l>
     <l n="69">Waste Zion 's walls and bulwarks to repair .</l>
     <l n="70">See golden prospects round us rise ,</l>
     <l n="71">See the dejected raise their downcast eyes ,</l>

    <head>A VOICE FROM THE DEAD !</head>
    <head>Written on being uncivilly treated , when erecting some Tombstones in —— Church Yard , where the Author was denied the use of any part of the Church , Porch , or Stable ; was forbidden to Letter the Stone in the Church Yard , though it was more than a mile from the Church to the nearest convenient place for such a work ; and was also denied the Keys of the Gate :— yet at that very time , the parson 's horse and cow , were feeding on the grass , tearing up the graves , and breaking down the stones , while none dared to complain !
