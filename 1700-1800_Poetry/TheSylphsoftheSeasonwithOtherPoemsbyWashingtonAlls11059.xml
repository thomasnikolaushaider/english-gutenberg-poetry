      <docTitle><titlePart>The Sylphs of the Seasons ; A Poet 's Dream . Prefatory Note to The Sylphs of the Seasons . As it may be objected to the following Poem , that some of the images there introduced are not wholly peculiar to the Season described , the Author begs leave to state , that , both in their selection and disposition , he was guided by that , which , in his limited experience , was found to be the Season of their greatest impression : and , though he has not always felt the necessity of pointing out the collateral causes by which the effect was increased , he yet flatters himself that , in general , they are sufficiently implied either by what follows or precedes them . Thus , for instance , the running brook , though by no means peculiar , is appropriated to Spring ; as affording by its motion and seeming exultation one of the most lively images of that spirit of renovation which animates the earth after its temporary suspension during the Winter . By the same rule , is assigned to Summer the placid lake , &amp; c. not because that image is never seen , or enjoyed , at any other season ; but on account of its affecting us more in Summer , than either in the Spring , or in Autumn ; the indolence and languor generally then experienced disposing us to dwell with particular delight on such an object of repose , not to mention the grateful idea of coolness derived from a knowledge of its temperature . Thus also the evening cloud , exhibiting a fleeting representation of successive objects , is , perhaps , justly appropriated to Autumn , as in that Season the general decay of inanimate nature leads the mind to turn upon itself , and without effort to apply almost every image of sense or vision of the imagination ,* to its own transitory state . If the above be admitted , it is needless to add more ; if it be not , it would be useless .</titlePart></docTitle>

       <l n="8">For , mounted on the Poet 's steed ,</l>
       <l n="9">I there my ceaseless journey speed</l>
       <l n="10">O'er mountain , wood , and stream :</l>
       <l n="11">And oft within a little day</l>
       <l n="12">‘ Mid comets fierce ‘ tis mine to stray ,</l>
       <l n="13">And wander o'er the Milky-way</l>

       <l n="15">But would the Man of Lucre know</l>
       <l n="16">What riches from my labours flow ?—</l>
       <l n="17">A DREAM is my reply .</l>
       <l n="18">And who for wealth has ever pin 'd ,</l>
       <l n="19">That had a World within his mind ,</l>
       <l n="20">Where every treasure he may find ,</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="22">One night , my task diurnal done ,</l>
       <l n="23">( For I had travell 'd with the Sun</l>
       <l n="24">O'er burning sands , o'er snows )</l>
       <l n="25">Fatigued , I sought the couch of rest ;</l>
       <l n="26">My wonted pray'r to Heaven address 'd ;</l>
       <l n="27">But scarce had I my pillow press 'd</l>
       <l n="28">When thus a vision rose .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="29">Methought within a desert cave ,</l>
       <l n="30">Cold , dark , and solemn as the grave ,</l>
       <l n="31">I suddenly awoke .</l>
       <l n="32">It seem 'd of sable Night the cell ,</l>
       <l n="33">Where , save when from the ceiling fell</l>
       <l n="34">An oozing drop , her silent spell</l>
       <l n="35">No sound had ever broke .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="6">
       <l n="36">There motionless I stood alone ,</l>
       <l n="37">Like some strange monument of stone</l>
       <l n="38">Upon a barren wild ;</l>
       <l n="39">Or like , ( so solid and profound</l>
       <l n="40">The darkness seem 'd that wall 'd me round )</l>
       <l n="41">A man that 's buried under ground ,</l>
       <l n="42">Where pyramids are pil 'd .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="7">
       <l n="43">Thus fix 'd , a dreadful hour I past ,</l>
       <l n="44">And now I heard , as from a blast ,</l>
       <l n="45">A voice pronounce my name :</l>
       <l n="46">Nor long upon my ear it dwelt ,</l>
       <l n="47">When round me ‘ gan the air to melt .</l>
       <l n="48">And motion once again I felt</l>
       <l n="49">Quick circling o'er my frame .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="50">Again it call 'd ; and then a ray ,</l>
       <l n="51">That seem 'd a gushing fount of day ,</l>
       <l n="52">Across the cavern stream 'd .</l>
       <l n="53">Half struck with terror and delight ,</l>
       <l n="54">I hail 'd the little blessed light ,</l>
       <l n="55">And follow 'd ‘ till my aching sight</l>
       <l n="56">An orb of darkness seem 'd .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="9">
       <l n="57">Nor long I felt the blinding pain ;</l>
       <l n="58">For soon upon a mountain plain</l>
       <l n="59">I gaz 'd with wonder new .</l>
       <l n="60">There high a castle rear 'd its head ;</l>
       <l n="61">And far below a region spread ,</l>
       <l n="62">Where every Season seem 'd to shed</l>
       <l n="63">Its own peculiar hue .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="64">Now at the castle 's massy gate ,</l>
       <l n="65">Like one that 's blindly urged by fate ,</l>
       <l n="66">A bugle-horn I blew .</l>
       <l n="67">The mountain-plain it shook around ,</l>
       <l n="68">The vales return 'd a hollow sound ,</l>
       <l n="69">And , moving with a sigh profound .</l>
       <l n="70">The portals open flew .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="11">
       <l n="71">Then ent'ring , from a glittering hall</l>
       <l n="72">I heard a voice seraphic call ,</l>
       <l n="73">That bade me “ ever reign ,</l>
       <l n="74">All hail ! ” it said in accent wild ,</l>
       <l n="75">“ For thou art Nature 's chosen child ,</l>
       <l n="76">Whom wealth nor blood has e'er defil 'd ,</l>
       <l n="77">Hail , Lord of this Domain ! ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="12">
       <l n="78">And now I paced a bright saloon ,</l>
       <l n="79">That seem 'd illumin 'd by the moon ,</l>
       <l n="80">So mellow was the light .</l>
       <l n="81">The walls with jetty darkness teem 'd ,</l>
       <l n="82">While down them chrystal columns streamed ,</l>
       <l n="83">And each a mountain torrent seem 'd .</l>
       <l n="84">High-flashing through the night .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="13">
       <l n="85">Rear 'd in the midst , a double throne .</l>
       <l n="86">Like burnish 'd cloud of evening shone ;</l>
       <l n="87">While , group 'd the base around ,</l>
       <l n="88">Four Damsels stood of Faery race ;</l>
       <l n="89">Who , turning each with heavenly grace</l>
       <l n="90">Upon me her immortal face ,</l>
       <l n="91">Transfix 'd me to the ground .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="14">
       <l n="92">And thus the foremost of the tram :</l>
       <l n="93">Be thine the throne , and thine to reign</l>
       <l n="94">O'er all the varying year !</l>
       <l n="95">But ere thou rulest the Fates command ;</l>
       <l n="96">That of our chosen rival band</l>
       <l n="97">A Sylph shall win thy heart and hand ,</l>
       <l n="98">Thy sovereignty to share .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="15">
       <l n="99">For we , the sisters of a birth ,</l>
       <l n="100">Do rule by turns the subject earth</l>
       <l n="101">To serve ungrateful man ;</l>
       <l n="102">But since our varied toils impart</l>
       <l n="103">No joy to his capricious heart ,</l>
       <l n="104">‘ Tis now ordain 'd that human art</l>
       <l n="105">Shall rectify the plan .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="16">
       <l n="106">Then spake the Sylph of Spring serene ,</l>
       <l n="107">‘ Tis I thy joyous heart I ween ,</l>
       <l n="108">With sympathy shall move :</l>
       <l n="109">For I with living melody</l>
       <l n="110">Of birds in choral symphony ,</l>
       <l n="111">First wak 'd thy soul to poesy ,</l>
       <l n="112">To piety and love .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="17">
       <l n="113">When thou , at call of vernal breeze ,</l>
       <l n="114">And beck'ning bough of budding trees ,</l>

       <l n="116">And stretch 'd thee in some mossy dell .</l>
       <l n="117">And heard the browsing wether 's bell ,</l>
       <l n="118">Blythe echoes rousing from their cell</l>
       <l n="119">To swell the tinkling quire :</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="18">
       <l n="120">Or heard from branch of flow'ring thorn</l>

       <l n="122">The tardy-moving swain ;</l>
       <l n="123">Hast bid the purple swallow hail ;</l>
       <l n="124">And seen him now through ether sail ,</l>
       <l n="125">Now sweeping downward o'er the vale .</l>
       <l n="126">And skimming now the plain ;</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="19">
       <l n="127">Then , catching with a sudden glance</l>
       <l n="128">The bright and silver-clear expanse</l>
       <l n="129">Of some broad river 's stream .</l>
       <l n="130">Beheld the boats adown it glide ,</l>
       <l n="131">And motion wind again the tide ,</l>
       <l n="132">Where , chain 'd in ice by Winter 's pride ,</l>

       <l n="138">Now faintly seen the ocean o'er ,</l>

       <l n="771">In academick lore profound ,</l>
       <l n="772">I boldly took that lofty ground ,</l>
       <l n="773">Which , as it rais 'd me near the sky ,</l>

       <l n="777">Yet still that misty height I chose ,</l>
       <l n="778">For well I knew the world had those ,</l>
       <l n="779">Whose sight , by learning clear 'd of rheum ,</l>
       <l n="780">Could pierce with ease the thickest gloom .</l>

       <l n="786">My drapery to bronze and tin ,</l>
       <l n="787">My flesh to brick and earthen ware ,</l>
       <l n="788">And wire of various kinds my hair ;</l>

       <l n="793">Yet this , and many a grosser rub ,</l>
       <l n="794">Like fam 'd Diogenes in tub ,</l>

       <l n="800">Yet thus I 'll prove it to a hair .—</l>

       <l n="803">And as the only power they boast ,</l>
       <l n="804">Is merely at each other 's cost ;</l>
       <l n="805">If both should hold an equal station ,</l>
       <l n="806">They 'd both be kings without a nation :</l>
       <l n="807">If therefore , one would paint the Mind</l>
       <l n="808">In partnership with Body join 'd ,</l>
       <l n="809">And give to each an equal place ,</l>

       <l n="815">To fix her pow'r beyond dispute ,</l>
       <l n="816">I trampled Body under foot :</l>
       <l n="817">That is , in more prosaick dress ,</l>

       <l n="828">I left my col'ring all to chance ;</l>

     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In a late beautiful poem by Mr. Montgomery is the following lines “ The spirits of departed hours . ” The Author , fearing that so singular a coincidence of thought and language might subject him to the charge of plagiarism , thinks it necessary to state that his poem was written long before he had the pleasure of reading Mr. M .' s .</p>
     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The Author would be sorry to have it supposed that he alludes here to any individual ; for he can say with truth , that such a character has never fallen under his observation : much less would he be thought to reflect on the Artists , as a class of men to which such baseness may be generally imputed . The case here is merely supposed , to shew how easily imbecility and selfishness may pervert this most innocent of all arts to the vilest purposes . He may be allowed also to disclaim an opinion too generally prevalent ; namely , that envy and detraction are the natural offspring of the art . That Artists should possess a portion of these vices , in common with Poets , Musicians , and other candidates for fame , is reasonably to be expected ; but that they should exclusively monopolise them , or even hold an undue proportion , ‘ twere ungenerous to suppose . The Author has known Artists in various countries ; and can truly say , that , with a very few exceptions , he has found them candid and liberal ; prompt to discover merit , and just in applauding it . If there have been exceptions , he has also generally been able to trace their cause to the unpropitious coincidence of narrow circumstances , a defective education , and poverty of intellect . Is it then surprising , that in the hands of such a triumvirate the art should be degraded to an imposture , to the trick of a juggler ? but it surely would be a cause of wonder , if , with such leprous members , the sound and respectable body of its professors should escape the suspicion of partaking their contamination .</p>

     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The Author having no revenge to gratify , and consequently no pleasure in giving pain , has purposely excluded the Works of all living Artists from this Gallery .</p>
     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>To those who are conversant with the Works of the Old Masters this piece of anachronism will hardly appear exaggerated .</p>
