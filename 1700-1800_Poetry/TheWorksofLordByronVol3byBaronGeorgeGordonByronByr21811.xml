    <head>PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME .</head>
    <p n="1">The present volume contains the six metrical tales which were composed within the years 1812 and 1815 , the Hebrew Melodies , and the minor poems of 1809-1816 . With the exception of the first fifteen poems ( 1809-1811 ) — Chansons de Voyage , as they might be called — the volume as a whole was produced on English soil . Beginning with the Giaour ; which followed in the wake of Childe Harold and shared its triumph , and ending with the ill-omened Domestic Pieces , or Poems of the Separation , the poems which Byron wrote in his own country synchronize with his popularity as a poet by the acclaim and suffrages of his own countrymen . His greatest work , by which his lasting fame has been established , and by which his relative merits as a great poet will be judged in the future , was yet to come ; but the work which made his name , which is stamped with his sign-manual , and which has come to be regarded as distinctively and characteristically Byronic , preceded maturity and achievement .</p>
    <p n="2">No poet of his own or other times , not Walter Scott , not Tennyson , not Mr. Kipling , was ever in his own lifetime so widely , so amazingly popular . Thousands of copies of the “ Tales ” — of the Bride of Abydos , of the Corsair , of Lara — were sold in a day , and edition followed edition month in and month out . Everywhere men talked about the “ noble author ” — in the capitals of Europe , in literary circles in the United States , in the East Indies . He was “ the glass of fashion ... the observ 'd of all observers , ” the swayer of sentiment , the master and creator of popular emotion . No other English poet before or since has divided men 's attention with generals and sea-captains and statesmen , has attracted and fascinated and overcome the world so entirely and potently as Lord Byron .</p>
    <p n="3">It was Childe Harold , the unfinished , immature Childe Harold , and the Turkish and other “ Tales , ” which raised this sudden and deafening storm of applause when the century was young , and now , at its close ( I refer , of course , to the Tales , not to Byron 's poetry as a whole , which , in spite of the critics , has held and still holds its own ) , are ignored if not forgotten , passed over if not despised — which but few know thoroughly , and “ very few ” are found to admire or to love . Ubi lapsus , quid feci ? might the questioning spirit of the author exclaim with regard to his “ Harrys and Larrys , Pilgrims and Pirates , ” who once held the field , and now seem to have gone under in the struggle for poetical existence !</p>
    <p n="4">To what , then , may we attribute the passing away of interest and enthusiasm ? To the caprice of fashion , to an insistence on a more faultless technique , to a nicer taste in ethical sentiment , to a preference for a subtler treatment of loftier themes ? More certainly , and more particularly , I think , to the blurring of outline and the blotting out of detail due to lapse of time and the shifting of the intellectual standpoint .</p>
    <p n="5">However much the charm of novelty and the contagion of enthusiasm may have contributed to the success of the Turkish and other Tales , it is in the last degree improbable that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers were enamoured , not of a reality , but of an illusion born of ignorance or of vulgar bewilderment . They were carried away because they breathed the same atmosphere as the singer ; and being undistracted by ethical , or grammatical , or metrical offences , they not only read these poems with avidity , but understood enough of what they read to be touched by their vitality , to realize their verisimilitude .</p>
    <p n="6">Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner . Nay , more , the knowledge , the comprehension of essential greatness in art , in nature , or in man is not to know that there is aught to forgive . But that sufficing knowledge which the reader of average intelligence brings with him for the comprehension and appreciation of contemporary literature has to be bought at the price of close attention and patient study when the subject-matter of a poem and the modes and movements of the poet 's consciousness are alike unfamiliar .</p>
    <p n="7">Criticism , however subtle , however suggestive , however luminous , will not bridge over the gap between the past and the present , will not supply the sufficing knowledge . It is delightful and interesting and , in a measure , instructive to know what great poets of his own time and of ours have thought of Byron , how he “ strikes ” them ; but unless we are ourselves saturated with his thought and style , unless we learn to breathe his atmosphere by reading the books which he read , picturing to ourselves the scenes which he saw ,— unless we aspire to his ideals and suffer his limitations , we are in no way entitled to judge his poems , whether they be good or bad .</p>
    <p n="8">Byron 's metrical “ Tales ” come before us in the guise of light reading , and may be “ easily criticized ” as melo-dramatic — the heroines conventional puppets , the heroes reduplicated reflections of the author 's personality , the Oriental “ properties ” loosely arranged , and somewhat stage-worn . A thorough and sympathetic study of these once extravagantly lauded and now belittled poems will not , perhaps , reverse the deliberate judgment of later generations , but it will display them for what they are , bold and rapid and yet exact presentations of the “ gorgeous East , ” vivid and fresh from the hand of the great artist who conceived them out of the abundance of memory and observation , and wrought them into shape with the “ pen of a ready writer . ” They will be once more recognized as works of genius , an integral portion of our literary inheritance , which has its proper value , and will repay a more assiduous and a finer husbandry .</p>
    <p n="9">I have once more to acknowledge the generous assistance of the officials of the British Museum , and , more especially , of Mr. A. G. Ellis , of the Oriental Printed Books and MSS . Department , who has afforded me invaluable instruction in the compilation of the notes to the Giaour and Bride of Abydos .</p>
    <p n="10">I have also to thank Mr. R. L. Binyon , of the Department of Prints and Drawings , for advice and assistance in the selection of illustrations .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION TO THE OCCASIONAL PIECES ( POEMS 1809-1813 ; POEMS 1814-1816 ) .</head>
    <p n="11">The Poems afterwards entitled “ Occasional Pieces , ” which were included in the several editions of the Collected Works issued by Murray , 1819-1831 , numbered fifty-seven in all . They may be described as the aggregate of the shorter poems written between the years 1809-1818 , which the author thought worthy of a permanent place among his poetical works . Of these the first twenty-nine appeared in successive editions of Childe Harold ( Cantos I ., II . ) [ viz . fourteen in the first edition , twenty in the second , and twenty-nine in the seventh edition ] , while the thirtieth , the Ode on the Death of Sir Peter Parker , was originally attached to Hebrew Melodies . The remaining twenty-seven pieces consist of six poems first published in the Second Edition of the Corsair , 1814 ; eleven which formed the collection entitled “ Poems , ” 1816 ; six which were appended to the Prisoner of Chillon , December , 1816 ; the Very Mournful Ballad , and the Sonnet by Vittorelli , which accompanied the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold , 1818 ; the Sketch , first included by Murray in his edition of 1819 ; and the Ode to Venice , which appeared in the same volume as Mazeppa .</p>
    <p n="12">Thus matters stood till 1831 , when seventy new poems ( sixty had been published by Moore , in Letters and Journals , 1830 , six were republished from Hobhouse 's Imitations and Translations , 1809 , and four derived from other sources ) were included in a sixth volume of the Collected Works .</p>
    <p n="13">In the edition of 1832-35 , twenty-four new poems were added , but four which had appeared in Letters and Journals , 1830 , and in the sixth volume of the edition of 1831 were omitted . In the one-volume edition ( first issued in 1837 and still in print ) , the four short pieces omitted in 1832 once more found a place , and the lines on “ John Keats , ” first published in Letters and Journals , and the two stanzas to Lady Caroline Lamb , “ Remember thee ! remember thee , ” first printed by Medwin , in the Conversations of Lord Byron , 1824 , were included in the Collection .</p>
    <p n="14">The third volume of the present issue includes all minor poems ( with the exception of epigrams and jeux d'esprit reserved for the sixth volume ) written after Byron 's departure for the East in July , 1809 , and before he left England for good in April , 1816 .</p>
    <p n="15">The “ Separation ” and its consequent exile afforded a pretext and an opportunity for the publication of a crop of spurious verses . Of these Madame Lavalette ( first published in the Examiner , January 21 , 1816 , under the signature B . B ., and immediately preceding a genuine sonnet by Wordsworth , “ How clear , how keen , how marvellously bright ! ” ) and Oh Shame to thee , Land of the Gaul ! included by Hone , in Poems on his Domestic Circumstances , 1816 ; and Farewell to England , Ode to the Isle of St. Helena , To the Lily of France , On the Morning of my Daughter 's Birth , published by J. Johnston , 1816 , were repudiated by Byron , in a letter to Murray , dated July 22 , 1816 . A longer poem entitled The Tempest , which was attached to the spurious Pilgrimage to the Holy Land , published by Johnston , “ the Cheapside impostor , ” in 1817 , was also denounced by Byron as a forgery in a letter to Murray , dated December 16 , 1816 .</p>
    <p n="16">The Triumph of the Whale , by Charles Lamb , and the Enigma on the Letter H , by Harriet Fanshawe , were often included in piratical editions of Byron 's Poetical Works . Other attributed poems which found their way into newspapers and foreign editions , viz . ( i . ) To my dear Mary Anne , 1804 , “ Adieu to sweet Mary for ever ; ” and ( ii . ) To Miss Chaworth , “ Oh , memory , torture me no more , ” 1804 , published in Works of Lord Byron , Paris , 1828 ; ( iii . ) lines written In the Bible , “ Within this awful volume lies , ” quoted in Life , Writings , Opinions , etc ., 1825 , iii . 414 ; ( iv . ) lines addressed to (? ) George Anson Byron , “ And dost thou ask the reason of my sadness ? ” Nicnac , March 29 , 1823 ; ( v .) To Lady Caroline Lamb , “ And sayst thou that I have not felt , ” published in Works , etc ., 1828 ; ( vi . ) lines To her who can best understand them , “ Be it so , we part for ever , ” published in the Works of Lord Byron , In Verse and Prose , Hartford , 1847 ; ( vii . ) Lines found in the Travellers ’ Book at Chamouni , “ How many numbered are , how few agreed ! ” published Works , etc ., 1828 ; and ( viii . ) a second copy of verses with the same title , “ All hail , Mont Blanc ! Mont-au-Vert , hail ! ” Life , Writings , etc ., 1825 , ii . 384 ; ( ix . ) Lines addressed by Lord Byron to Mr. Hobhouse on his Election for Westminster , “ Would you get to the house by the true gate ? ” Works , etc ., 1828 ; and ( x . ) Enigma on the Letter I , “ I am not in youth , nor in manhood , nor age , ” Works , etc ., Paris , p. 720 , together with sundry epigrams , must , failing the production of the original MSS ., be accounted forgeries , or , perhaps , in one or two instances , of doubtful authenticity .</p>
    <p n="17">The following poems : On the Quotation , “ And my true faith ” etc . ; [ Love and Gold ] ; Julian [ a Fragment ] ; and On the Death of the Duke of Dorset , are now published for the first time from MSS . in the possession of Mr. John Murray .</p>

     <l n="1">In one dread night our city saw , and sighed ,</l>
     <l n="2">Bowed to the dust , the Drama 's tower of pride ;</l>
     <l n="3">In one short hour beheld the blazing fane ,</l>

     <l n="8">Like Israel 's pillar , chase the night from heaven ;</l>
     <l n="9">Saw the long column of revolving flames</l>
     <l n="10">Shake its red shadow o'er the startled Thames ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>10</l>
     <l n="11">While thousands , thronged around the burning dome ,</l>
     <l n="12">Shrank back appalled , and trembled for their home ,</l>
     <l n="13">As glared the volumed blaze , and ghastly shone [ bn ]</l>
     <l n="14">The skies , with lightnings awful as their own ,</l>
     <l n="15">Till blackening ashes and the lonely wall [ bo ]</l>
     <l n="16">Usurped the Muse 's realm , and marked her fall ;</l>

     <l n="21">Yes — it shall be — the magic of that name</l>

     <l n="24">And bids the Drama be where she hath been :</l>

     <l n="30">Names such as hallow still the dome we lost . 30</l>
     <l n="31">On Drury first your Siddons ’ thrilling art</l>
     <l n="32">O'erwhelmed the gentlest , stormed the sternest heart .</l>
     <l n="33">On Drury , Garrick 's latest laurels grew ;</l>
     <l n="34">Here your last tears retiring Roscius drew ,</l>
     <l n="35">Sighed his last thanks , and wept his last adieu :</l>
     <l n="36">But still for living wit the wreaths may bloom ,</l>

     <l n="38">Such Drury claimed and claims — nor you refuse</l>
     <l n="39">One tribute to revive his slumbering muse ;</l>
     <l n="40">With garlands deck your own Menander 's head , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Nor hoard your honours idly for the dead ! [ bq ]</l>
     <l n="42">Dear are the days which made our annals bright ,</l>
     <l n="43">Ere Garrick fled , or Brinsley<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>ceased to write [ br ]</l>
     <l n="44">Heirs to their labours , like all high-born heirs ,</l>
     <l n="45">Vain of our ancestry as they of theirs ;</l>
     <l n="46">While thus Remembrance borrows Banquo 's glass</l>
     <l n="47">To claim the sceptred shadows as they pass ,</l>
     <l n="48">And we the mirror hold , where imaged shine</l>
     <l n="49">Immortal names , emblazoned on our line ,</l>
     <l n="50">Pause — ere their feebler offspring you condemn , 50</l>

   <note>This thunderstorm occurred during the night of the 11th October , 1809 , when Lord Byron 's guides had lost the road to Zitza , near the range of mountains formerly called Pindus , in Albania . Hobhouse , who had ridden on before the rest of the party , and arrived at Zitza just as the evening set in , describes the thunder as rolling “ without intermission — the echoes of one peal had not ceased to roll in the mountains , before another tremendous crash burst over our heads , whilst the plains and the distant hills , visible through the cracks in the cabin , appeared in a perpetual blaze . The tempest was altogether terrific , and worthy of the Grecian Jove . Lord Byron , with the priest and the servants , did not enter our hut before three ( in the morning ) . I now learnt from him that they had lost their way , ... and that after wandering up and down in total ignorance of their position , had , at last , stopped near some Turkish tombstones and a torrent , which they saw by the flashes of lightning . They had been thus exposed for nine hours .... It was long before we ceased to talk of the thunderstorm in the plain of Zitza . ” — Travels in Albania , 1858 , i . 70 , 72 ; Childe Harold , Canto II . stanza xlviii ., Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 129 , note 1 .</note>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>{ 13 } On the 3rd of May , 1810 , while the Salsette ( Captain Bathurst ) was lying in the Dardanelles , Lieutenant Ekenhead , of that frigate , and the writer of these rhymes , swam from the European shore to the Asiatic — by the by , from Abydos to Sestos would have been more correct . The whole distance , from the place whence we started to our landing on the other side , including the length we were carried by the current , was computed by those on board the frigate at upwards of four English miles , though the actual breadth is barely one . The rapidity of the current is such that no boat can row directly across , and it may , in some measure , be estimated from the circumstance of the whole distance being accomplished by one of the parties in an hour and five , and by the other in an hour and ten minutes . The water was extremely cold , from the melting of the mountain snows . About three weeks before , in April , we had made an attempt ; but having ridden all the way from the Troad the same morning , and the water being of an icy chillness , we found it necessary to postpone the completion till the frigate anchored below the castles , when we swam the straits as just stated , entering a considerable way above the European , and landing below the Asiatic , fort . [ Le ] Chevalier says that a young Jew swam the same distance for his mistress ; and Olivier mentions its having been done by a Neapolitan ; but our consul , Tarragona , remembered neither of these circumstances , and tried to dissuade us from the attempt . A number of the Salsette 's crew were known to have accomplished a greater distance ; and the only thing that surprised me was that , as doubts had been entertained of the truth of Leander 's story , no traveller had ever endeavoured to ascertain its practicability . [ See letter to Drury , dated May 3 ; to his mother , May 24 , 1810 , etc . ( Letters , 1898 , i . 262 , 275 ) . Compare the well-known lines in Don Juan , Canto II . stanza cv .—</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>[ The Maid of Athens was , it is supposed , the eldest of three sisters , daughters of Theodora Macri , the widow of a former English vice-consul . Byron and Hobhouse lodged at her house . The sisters were sought out and described by the artist , Hugh W. Williams , who visited Athens in May , 1817 : “ Theresa , the Maid of Athens , Catinco , and Mariana , are of middle stature .... The two eldest have black , or dark hair and eyes ; their visage oval , and complexion somewhat pale , with teeth of pearly whiteness . Their cheeks are rounded , their noses straight , rather inclined to aquiline . The youngest , Mariana , is very fair , her face not so finely rounded , but has a gayer expression than her sisters ’ , whose countenances , except when the conversation has something of mirth in it , may be said to be rather pensive . Their persons are elegant , and their manners pleasing and lady-like , such as would be fascinating in any country . They possess very considerable powers of conversation , and their minds seem to be more instructed than those of the Greek women in general . ” — Travels in Italy , Greece , etc ., ii . 291 , 292 .</p>
   <p>Other travellers , Hughes , who visited Athens in 1813 , and Walsh ( Narrative of a Resident in Constantinople , i . 122 ) , who saw Theresa in 1821 , found her charming and interesting , but speak of her beauty as a thing of the past . “ She married an Englishman named Black , employed in H. M. Consular Service at Mesolonghi . She survived her husband and fell into great poverty .... Theresa Black died October 15 , 1875 , aged 80 years . ” ( See Letters , 1898 , i . 269 , 270 , note 1 ; and Life , p. 105 , note . )</p>
   <p>“ Maid of Athens ” is possibly the best-known of Byron 's short poems , all over the English-speaking world . This is no doubt due in part to its having been set to music by about half a dozen composers — the latest of whom was Gounod . ]</p>

   <p>In a curious work of doubtful authority , entitled , The Life , Writings , Opinions and Times of the Right Hon . G. G. Noel Byron , London , 1825 ( iii . 123-132 ) , there is a long and circumstantial narrative of a “ defeated ” attempt of Byron 's to rescue a Georgian girl , whom he had bought in the slave-market for 800 piastres , from a life of shame and degradation .

He explains in a footnote that the metre is “ a mixed trochaic , except the chorus . ” “ This song , ” he adds , “ the chorus particularly , is sung to a tune very nearly the same as the Marseillois Hymn .

   </lg>
   <p>“ There can be no doubt that Lord Byron referred to Thyrza in conversation with Lady Byron , and probably also with Mrs. Leigh , as a young girl who had existed , and the date of whose death almost coincided with Lord Byron 's landing in England in 1811 . On one occasion he showed Lady Byron a beautiful tress of hair , which she understood to be Thyrza 's . He said he had never mentioned her name , and that now she was gone his breast was the sole depository of that secret . ‘ I took the name of Thyrza from Gesner . She was Abel 's wife . ’</p>
   <p>“ Thyrza is mentioned in a letter from Elizabeth , Duchess of Devonshire , to Augustus Foster ( London , May 4 , 1812 ): ‘ Your little friend , Caro William ( Lady Caroline Lamb ) , as usual , is doing all sorts of imprudent things for him ( Lord Byron ) and with him ; he admires her very much , but is supposed by some to admire our Caroline ( the Hon . Mrs. George Lamb ) more ; he says she is like Thyrsa , and her singing is enchantment to him . ’ From this extract it is obvious that Thyrza is alluded to in the following lines , which , with the above quotation , may be reproduced , by kind permission of Mr. Vere Foster , from his most interesting book , The Two Duchesses ( 1898 , pp . 362-374 ) .</p>

     <l n="3">“ ‘ The sacred song that on my ear</l>
     <l n="4">Yet vibrates from that voice of thine</l>
     <l n="5">I heard before from one so dear ,</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Tis strange it still appears divine .</l>
     <l n="7">But oh ! so sweet that look and tone</l>
     <l n="8">To her and thee alike is given ;</l>
     <l n="9">It seemed as if for me alone</l>
     <l n="10">That both had been recalled from Heaven .</l>
     <l n="11">And though I never can redeem</l>
     <l n="12">The vision thus endeared to me ,</l>
     <l n="13">I scarcely can regret my dream</l>
     <l n="14">When realized again by thee . ’ ”</l>

   <p>( It may be noted that the name Thirza , or Thyrza , a variant of Theresa , had been familiar to Byron in his childhood . In the Preface to Cain he writes , “ Gesner 's Death of Abel ! I have never read since I was eight years of age at Aberdeen . The general impression of my recollection is delight ; but of the contents I remember only that Cain 's wife was called Mahala , and Abel 's Thirza . ” Another and more immediate suggestion of the name may be traced to the following translation of Meleager 's Epitaphium In Heliodoram , which one of the “ associate bards , ” Bland , or Merivale , or Hodgson , contributed to their Translations chiefly from the Greek Anthology , 1806 , p. 4 , a work which Byron singles out for commendation in English Bards , etc , ( lines 881-890 ):—</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>[ The scene which begat these memorable stanzas was enacted at a banquet at Carlton House , February 22 , 1812 . On March 6 the following quatrain , entitled , “ Impromptu on a Recent Incident , ” appeared in the Morning Chronicle :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Blest omens of a happy reign ,</l>
     <l n="2">In swift succession hourly rise ,</l>
     <l n="3">Forsaken friends , vows made in vain —</l>
     <l n="4">A daughter 's tears , a nation 's sighs . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Byron 's lines , headed , “ Sympathetic Address to a Young Lady , ” were published anonymously in the Morning Chronicle of March 7 , but it was not till March 10 that the Courier ventured to insert a report of “ The Fracas at Carlton House on the 22nd ult ., ” which had already been communicated to the Caledonian Mercury .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The party consisted of the Princess Charlotte , the Duchess of</l>
     <l n="2">York , the Dukes of York and Cambridge , Lords Moira , Erskine ,</l>
     <l n="3">Lauderdale , Messrs. Adams and Sheridan .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Prince Regent expressed ‘ his surprise and mortification ’ at the conduct of Lords Grey and Grenville [ who had replied unfavourably to a letter addressed by the P. R . to the Duke of York , suggesting an united administration ] . Lord Lauderdale thereupon , with a freedom unusual in courts , asserted that the reply did not express the opinions of Lords Grey and Grenville only , but of every political friend of that way of thinking , and that he had been present at and assisted in the drawing-up , and that every sentence had his cordial assent . The Prince was suddenly and deeply affected by Lord Lauderdale 's reply , so much so , that the Princess , observing his agitation , dropt her head and burst into tears — upon which the Prince turned round and begged the female part of the company to withdraw . ”</p>
   <p>In the following June , at a ball at Miss Johnson 's , Byron was “ presented by order to our gracious Regent , who honoured me with some conversation , ” and for a time he ignored and perhaps regretted his anonymous jeu d'esprit . But early in 1814 , either out of mere bravado or in an access of political rancour , he determined to republish the stanzas under his own name . The first edition of the Corsair was printed , if not published , but in accordance with a peremptory direction ( January 22 , 1814 ) , “ eight lines on the little Royalty weeping in 1812 , ” were included among the poems printed at the end of the second edition .</p>

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO THE GIAOUR</p>
   <p>In a letter to Murray , dated Pisa , December 12 , 1821 ( Life , p. 545 ) , Byron avows that the “ Giaour Story ” had actually “ some foundation on facts . ” Soon after the poem appeared ( June 5 , 1813 ) , “ a story was circulated by some gentlewomen ... a little too close to the text ” ( Letters to Moore , September 1 , 1813 , Letters , 1898 , ii . 258 ) , and in order to put himself right with his friends or posterity , Byron wrote to his friend Lord Sligo , who in July , 1810 , was anchored off Athens in “ a twelve-gun brig , with a crew of fifty men ” ( see Letters , 1898 , i . 289 , note 1 ) , requesting him to put on paper not so much the narrative of an actual event , but “ what he had heard at Athens about the affair of that girl who was so near being put an end to while you were there . ” According to the letter which Moore published ( Life , p. 178 ) , and which is reprinted in the present issue ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 257 ) , Byron interposed on behalf of a girl , who “ in compliance with the strict letter of the Mohammedan law , ” had been sewn in a sack and was about to be thrown into the sea . “ I was told , ” adds Lord Sligo , “ that you then conveyed her in safety to the convent , and despatched her off at night to Thebes . ” The letter , which Byron characterizes as “ curious , ” is by no means conclusive , and to judge from the designedly mysterious references in the Journal , dated November 16 and December 5 , and in the second postscript to a letter to Professor Clarke , dated December 15 , 1813 ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 321 , 361 , 311 ) , “ the circumstances which were the groundwork ” are not before us . “ An event , ” says John Wright ( ed . 1832 , ix . 145 ) , “ in which Lord Byron was personally concerned , undoubtedly supplied the groundwork of this tale ; but for the story so circumstantially set forth ( see Medwin 's Conversations , 1824 , pp . 121 , 124 ) of his having been the lover of this female slave , there is no foundation . The girl whose life the poet saved at Athens was not , we are assured by Sir John Hobhouse ( Westminster Review , January , 1825 , iii . 27 ) , an object of his Lordship 's attachment , but of that of his Turkish servant . ” Nevertheless , whatever Byron may have told Hobhouse ( who had returned to England ) , and he distinctly says ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 393 ) that he did not tell him everything , he avowed to Clarke that he had been led “ to the water 's edge , ” and confided to his diary that to “ describe the feelings of that situation was impossible — it is icy even to recollect them . ”</p>
   <p>For the allusive and fragmentary style of the Giaour , The Voyage of Columbus , which Rogers published in 1812 , is in part responsible . “ It is sudden in its transitions , ” wrote the author , in the Preface to the first edition , “ ... leaving much to be imagined by the reader . ” The story or a part of it is told by a fellow-seaman of Columbus , who had turned “ eremite ” in his old age , and though the narrative itself is in heroic verse , the prologue and epilogue , as they may be termed , are in “ the romance or ballad-measure of the Spanish . ” The resemblance between the two poems is certainly more than accidental . On the other hand , a vivid and impassioned description of Oriental scenery and customs was , as Gifford observed , new and original , and though , by his own admission , Byron was indebted to Vathek ( or rather S. Henley 's notes to Vathek ) and to D'Herbelot ' s Bibliothèque Orientale for allusions and details , the “ atmosphere ” could only have been reproduced by the creative fancy of an observant and enthusiastic traveller who had lived under Eastern skies , and had come within ken of Eastern life and sentiment .</p>
   <p>In spite , however , of his love for the subject-matter of his poem , and the facility , surprising even to himself , with which he spun his rhymes , Byron could not persuade himself that a succession of fragments would sort themselves and grow into a complete and connected whole . If his thrice-repeated depreciation of the Giaour is not entirely genuine , it is plain that he misdoubted himself . Writing to Murray ( August 26 , 1813 ) he says , “ I have , but with some difficulty , not added any more to this snake of a poem , which has been lengthening its rattles every month ; ” to Moore ( September 1 ) , “ The Giaour I have added to a good deal , but still in foolish fragments ; ” and , again , to Moore ( September 8 ) , “ By the coach I send you a copy of that awful pamphlet the Giaour . ”</p>
   <p>But while the author doubted and apologized , or deprecated “ his love 's excess In words of wrong and bitterness , ” the public read , and edition followed edition with bewildering speed .</p>
   <p>The Giaour was reviewed by George Agar Ellis in the Quarterly ( No . xxxi ., January , 1813 [ published February 11 , 1813 ]) and in the Edinburgh Review by Jeffrey ( No . 54 , January , 1813 [ published February 24 , 1813 ]) .</p>

    <head>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON THE GIAOUR</head>
    <head>The bibliography of the Giaour is beset with difficulties , and it is doubtful if more than approximate accuracy can be secured . The composition of the entire poem in its present shape was accomplished within six months , May-November , 1813 , but during that period it was expanded by successive accretions from a first draft of 407 lines ( extant in MS .) to a seventh edition of 1334 lines . A proof is extant of an edition of 28 pages containing 460 lines , itself an enlargement on the MS .; but whether ( as a note in the handwriting of the late Mr. Murray affirms ) this was or was not published is uncertain . A portion of a second proof of 38 pages has been preserved , but of the publication of the poem in this state there is no record . On June 5 a first edition of 41 pages , containing 685 lines , was issued , and of this numerous copies are extant . At the end of June , or the beginning of July , 1813 , a second edition , entitled , a “ New Edition with some Additions , ” appeared . This consisted of 47 pages , and numbered 816 lines . Among the accretions is to be found the famous passage beginning , “ He that hath bent him o'er the dead . ” Two MS. copies of this pannus vere purpureus are in Mr. Murray 's possession . At the end of July , and during the first half of August , two or more issues of a third edition were set up in type . The first issue amounted to 53 pages , containing 950 lines , was certainly published in this form , and possibly a second issue of 56 pages , containing 1004 lines , may have followed at a brief interval . A revise of this second issue , dated August 13 , is extant . In the last fortnight of August a fourth edition of 58 pages , containing 1048 lines , undoubtedly saw the light . Scarcely more than a few days can have elapsed before a fifth edition of 66 pages , containing 1215 lines , was ready to supplant the fourth edition . A sixth edition , a reproduction of the fifth , may have appeared in October . A seventh edition of 75 pages , containing 1334 lines , which presented the poem in its final shape , was issued subsequently to November 27 , 1813 ( a seventh edition was advertised in the Morning Chronicle , December 22 , 1813 ) , the date of the last revise , or of an advance copy of the issue . The ninth , tenth , eleventh , and twelfth editions belong to 1814 , while a fourteenth edition is known to have been issued in 1815 . In that year and henceforward the Giaour was included in the various collected editions of Byron 's works . The subjoined table assigns to their several editions the successive accretions in their order as now published :—</head>

   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>The tale which these disjointed fragments present , is founded upon circumstances now less common in the East than formerly ; either because the ladies are more circumspect than in the “ olden time , ” or because the Christians have better fortune , or less enterprise . The story , when entire , contained the adventures of a female slave , who was thrown , in the Mussulman manner , into the sea for infidelity , and avenged by a young Venetian , her lover , at the time the Seven Islands were possessed by the Republic of Venice , and soon after the Arnauts were beaten back from the Morea , which they had ravaged for some time subsequent to the Russian invasion . The desertion of the Mainotes , on being refused the plunder of Misitra , led to the abandonment of that enterprise , and to the desolation of the Morea , during which the cruelty exercised on all sides was unparalleled even in the annals of the faithful .</p>

   <p>The traditional site of the tomb of Themistocles , “ a rock-hewn grave on the very margin of the sea generally covered with water , ” adjoins the lighthouse , which stands on the westernmost promontory of the Piræus , some three quarters of a mile from the entrance to the harbour . Plutarch , in his Themistocles ( cap . xxxii . ) , is at pains to describe the exact site of the “ altar-like tomb , ” and quotes the passage from Plato ( the comic poet , B.

   <p>[ The MS. and First Edition read , “ Bright as the gem of Giamschid . ” Byron 's first intention was to change the line into “ Bright as the ruby of Giamschid ; ” but to this Moore objected , “ that as the comparison of his heroine 's eye to a ruby might unluckily call up the idea of its being bloodshot , he had better change the line to ‘ Bright as the jewel , ’ etc . ”</p>

   <p>Sir Richard Burton ( Arabian Nights , S. N ., iii . 440 ) gives the following résumé of the conflicting legends : “ Jám-i-jámshid is a well-known commonplace in Moslem folk-lore ; but commentators cannot agree whether ‘ Jám ’ be a mirror or a cup . In the latter sense it would represent the Cyathomantic cup of the Patriarch Joseph , and the symbolic bowl of Nestor . Jamshid may be translated either ‘ Jam the bright , ’ or ‘ the Cup of the Sun ; ’ this ancient king is the Solomon of the grand old Guebres . ”</p>

   <p>Arsenius , Archbishop of Monembasia ( circ . 1530 ) , was famous for his scholarship . He prefaced his Scholia in Septem Euripidis Tragædias ( Basileæ , 1544 ) by a dedicatory epistle in Greek to his friend Pope Paul III . “ He submitted to the Church of Rome , which made him so odious to the Greek schismatics that the Patriarch of Constantinople excommunicated him ; and the Greeks reported that Arsenius , after his death , was Broukolakas , that is , that the Devil hovered about his corps and re-animated him ” ( Bayle , Dictionary , 1724 , i . 508 , art . “ Arsenius ” ) . Martinus Crusius , in his Turco-Græcia , lib . ii . ( Basileæ , 1584 , p. 151 ) records the death of Arsenius while under sentence of excommunication , and adds that “ his miserable corpse turned black , and swelled to the size of a drum , so that all who beheld it were horror-stricken , and trembled exceedingly . ” Hence , no doubt , the legend which Bayle takes verbatim from Guillet , “ Les Grecs disent qu ’ Arsenius , apres la mort fust Broukolakas , ” etc . ( Lacédémone , Ancienne et Nouvelle , par Le Sieur de la Guilletiére , 1676 , ii . 586 . See , too , for “ Arsenius , ” Fabricii Script . Gr . Var ., 1808 , xi . 581 , and Gesneri Bibliotheca Univ ., ed . 1545 , fol . 96 . ) Byron , no doubt , got his information from Bayle .

   <note>Vampires were the reanimated corpses of persons newly buried , which were supposed to suck the blood and suck out the life of their selected victims . The marks by which a vampire corpse was recognized were the apparent non-putrefaction of the body and effusion of blood from the lips . A suspected vampire was exhumed , and if the marks were perceived or imagined to be present , a stake was driven through the heart , and the body was burned . This , if Southey 's authorities ( J . B. Boyer , Marquis d'Argens , in Lettres Juives ) may be believed , “ laid ” the vampire , and the community might sleep in peace .

Apparently the question , “ How name ye ? ” is put by the fisherman , the narrator of the first part of the Fragment , and answered by a monk of the fraternity , with whom the Giaour has been pleased to “ abide ” during the past six years , under conditions and after a fashion of which the monk disapproves . Hereupon the fisherman disappears , and a kind of dialogue between the author and the protesting monk ensues . The poem concludes with the Giaour 's confession , which is addressed to the monk , or perhaps to the interested and more tolerant Prior of the community .</note>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 117 ]</span>This superstition of a second-hearing ( for I never met with downright second-sight in the East ) fell once under my own observation . On my third journey to Cape Colonna , early in 1811 , as we passed through the defile that leads from the hamlet between Keratia and Colonna , I observed Dervish Tahiri riding rather out of the path and leaning his head upon his hand , as if in pain . I rode up and inquired . “ We are in peril , ” he answered . “ What peril ? We are not now in Albania , nor in the passes to Ephesus , Messalunghi , or Lepanto ; there are plenty of us , well armed , and the Choriates have not courage to be thieves . ” — “ True , Affendi , but nevertheless the shot is ringing in my ears . ” — “ The shot . Not a tophaike has been fired this morning . ” — “ I hear it notwithstanding — Bom — Bom — as plainly as I hear your voice . ” — “ Psha ! ” — “ As you please , Affendi ; if it is written , so will it be . ” — I left this quick-eared predestinarian , and rode up to Basili , his Christian compatriot , whose ears , though not at all prophetic , by no means relished the intelligence . We all arrived at Colonna , remained some hours , and returned leisurely , saying a variety of brilliant things , in more languages than spoiled the building of Babel , upon the mistaken seer . Romaic , Arnaout , Turkish , Italian , and English were all exercised , in various conceits , upon the unfortunate Mussulman . While we were contemplating the beautiful prospect , Dervish was occupied about the columns . I thought he was deranged into an antiquarian , and asked him if he had become a “ Palaocastro ” man ? “ No , ” said he ; “ but these pillars will be useful in making a stand ; ” and added other remarks , which at least evinced his own belief in his troublesome faculty of forehearing . On our return to Athens we heard from Leoné ( a prisoner set ashore some days after ) of the intended attack of the Mainotes , mentioned , with the cause of its not taking place , in the notes to Childe Harold , Canto 2nd [ Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 169 ] . I was at some pains to question the man , and he described the dresses , arms , and marks of the horses of our party so accurately , that , with other circumstances , we could not doubt of his having been in “ villanous company ” [ I Henry IV ., act iii . sc . 3 , line 11 ] and ourselves in a bad neighbourhood . Dervish became a soothsayer for life , and I dare say is now hearing more musketry than ever will be fired , to the great refreshment of the Arnaouts of Berat , and his native mountains .— I shall mention one trait more of this singular race . In March , 1811 , a remarkably stout and active Arnaout came ( I believe the fiftieth on the same errand ) to offer himself as an attendant , which was declined . “ Well , Affendi , ” quoth he , “ may you live !— you would have found me useful . I shall leave the town for the hills to-morrow ; in the winter I return , perhaps you will then receive me . ” — Dervish , who was present , remarked as a thing of course , and of no consequence , “ in the mean time he will join the Klephtes ” ( robbers ) , which was true to the letter . If not cut off , they come down in the winter , and pass it unmolested in some town , where they are often as well known as their exploits .</p>

They were seized , fastened up in sacks , and drowned in the lake the same night ! One of the guards who was present informed me that not one of the victims uttered a cry , or showed a symptom of terror at so sudden a “ wrench from all we know , from all we love . ” The fate of Phrosine , the fairest of this sacrifice , is the subject of many a Romaic and Arnaout ditty . The story in the text is one told of a young Venetian many years ago , and now nearly forgotten . I heard it by accident recited by one of the coffee-house story-tellers who abound in the Levant , and sing or recite their narratives . The additions and interpolations by the translator will be easily distinguished from the rest , by the want of Eastern imagery ; and I regret that my memory has retained so few fragments of the original . For the contents of some of the notes I am indebted partly to D'Herbelot , and partly to that most Eastern , and , as Mr. Weber justly entitles it , “ sublime tale , ” the “ Caliph Vathek . ” I do not know from what source the author of that singular volume may have drawn his materials ; some of his incidents are to be found in the Bibliothèque Orientale ; but for correctness of costume , beauty of description , and power of imagination , it far surpasses all European imitations , and bears such marks of originality that those who have visited the East will find some difficulty in believing it to be more than a translation . As an Eastern tale , even Rasselas must bow before it ; his “ Happy Valley ” will not bear a comparison with the “ Hall of Eblis . ” [ See Childe Harold , Canto II . stanza xxii . line 6 , Poetical Works , 1899 , ii . 37 , note 1 .</p>
   <p>“ Mansour Effendi tells the story ( vide supra , line 6 ) thus : Frosini was niece of the Archbishop of Joannina . Mouctar Pasha ordered her to come to his harem , and her father advised her to go ; she did so . Mouctar , among other presents , gave her a ring of great value , which she wished to sell , and gave it for that purpose to a merchant , who offered it to the wife of Mouctar . That lady recognized the jewel as her own , and , discovering the intrigue , complained to Ali Pasha , who , the next night , seized her himself in his own house , and ordered her to be drowned . Mansour Effendi says he had the story from the brother and son of Frosini . This son was a child of six years old , and was in bed in his mother 's chamber when Ali came to carry away his mother to death . He had a confused recollection of the horrid scene . ” — Travels in Albania , 1858 , i . Ill , note 6 .</p>

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO THE THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS .</p>
   <p>Many poets — Wordsworth , for instance — have been conscious in their old age that an interest attaches to the circumstances of the composition of their poems , and have furnished their friends and admirers with explanatory notes . Byron recorded the motif and occasion of the Bride of Abydos while the poem was still in the press . It was written , he says , to divert his mind , “ to wring his thoughts from reality to imagination — from selfish regrets to vivid recollections ” ( Diary , December 5 , 1813 , Letters , ii . 361 ) , “ to distract his dreams from ... ” ( Diary , November 16 ) “ for the sake of employment ” ( Letter to Moore , November 30 , 1813 ) . He had been staying during part of October and November at Aston Hall , Rotherham , with his friend James Wedderburn Webster , and had fallen in love with his friend 's wife , Lady Frances . From a brief note to his sister , dated November 5 , we learn that he was in a scrape , but in “ no immediate peril , ” and from the lines , “ Remember him , whom Passion 's power ” ( vide ante , p. 67 ) , we may infer that he had sought safety in flight . The Bride of Abydos , or Zuleika , as it was first entitled , was written early in November , “ in four nights ” ( Diary , November 16 ) , or in a week ( Letter to Gifford , November 12 ) — the reckoning goes for little — as a counter-irritant to the pain and distress of amour interrompu .</p>
   <p>The confession or apology is eminently characteristic . Whilst the Giaour was still in process of evolution , still “ lengthening its rattles , ” another Turkish poem is offered to the public , and the natural explanation , that the author is in vein , and can score another trick , is felt to be inadequate and dishonouring — “ To withdraw myself from myself , ” he confides to his Diary ( November 27 ) , “ has ever been my sole , my entire , my sincere motive for scribbling at all . ”</p>
   <p>It is more than probable that in his twenty-sixth year Byron had not attained to perfect self-knowledge , but there is no reason to question his sincerity . That Byron loved to surround himself with mystery , and to dissociate himself from “ the general , ” is true enough ; but it does not follow that at all times and under all circumstances he was insincere . “ Once a poseur always a poseur ” is a rough-and-ready formula not invariably applicable even to a poet .</p>
   <p>But the Bride of Abydos was a tonic as well as a styptic . Like the Giaour , it embodied a personal experience , and recalled “ a country replete with the darkest and brightest , but always the most lively colours of my memory ” ( Diary , December 5 , 1813 ) .</p>
   <p>In a letter to Galt ( December 11 , 1813 , Letters , 1898 , ii . 304 , reprinted from Life of Byron , pp . 181 , 182 ) Byron maintains that the first part of the Bride was drawn from “ observations ” of his own , “ from existence . ” He had , it would appear , intended to make the story turn on the guilty love of a brother for a sister , a tragic incident of life in a Harem , which had come under his notice during his travels in the East , but “ on second thoughts ” had reflected that he lived “ two centuries at least too late for the subject , ” and that not even the authority of the “ finest works of the Greeks , ” or of Schiller ( in the Bride of Messina ) , or of Alfieri ( in Mirra ) , “ in modern times , ” would sanction the intrusion of the μισητὸν [ misêto \ n ] into English literature . The early drafts and variants of the MS. do not afford any evidence of this alteration of the plot which , as Byron thought , was detrimental to the poem as a work of art , but the undoubted fact that the Bride of Abydos , as well as the Giaour , embody recollections of actual scenes and incidents which had burnt themselves into the memory of an eye-witness , accounts not only for the fervent heat at which these Turkish tales were written , but for the extraordinary glamour which they threw over contemporary readers , to whom the local colouring was new and attractive , and who were not out of conceit with “ good Monsieur Melancholy . ”</p>
   <p>Byron was less dissatisfied with his second Turkish tale than he had been with the Giaour . He apologizes for the rapidity with which it had been composed — stans pede in uno — but he announced to Murray ( November 20 ) that “ he was doing his best to beat the Giaour , ” and ( November 29 ) he appraises the Bride as “ my first entire composition of any length . ”</p>
   <p>Moreover , he records ( November 15 ) , with evident gratification , the approval of his friend Hodgson , “ a very sincere and by no means ( at times ) a flattering critic of mine , ” and modestly accepts the praise of such masters of letters as “ Mr. Canning , ” Hookham Frere , Heber , Lord Holland , and of the traveller Edward Daniel Clarke .</p>

     <l n="1">The Bride of Abydos was advertised in the Morning Chronicle , among</l>

    <head>NOTE TO THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS .</head>
     <head>CANTO II . STANZA XX .</head>
    <head>After the completion of the fair copy of the MS. of the Bride of Abydos , seventy lines were added to stanza xx . of Canto II . In both MSS . the rough and fair copies , the stanza ends with the line , “ The Dove of peace and promise to mine ark ! ”</head>
     <l n="1">Seven MS. sheets are extant , which make up the greater portion of these</l>
     <l n="2">additional lines .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The First Addition amounts to eight lines , and takes the narrative from line 880 to line 893 , “ Wait — wave — defend — destroy — at thy command ! ”</p>
   <p>Lines 884-889 do not appear in the first MS. Fragment , but are given in three variants on separate sheets . Two of these are dated December 2 and December 3 , 1813 .</p>
   <p>The Second Fragment begins with line 890 , “ For thee in those bright isles is built a bower , ” and , numbering twenty-two lines , ends with a variant of line 907 , “ Blend every thought , do all — but disunite ! ” Two lines of this addition , “ With thee all toils are sweet , ” find a place in the text as lines 934 , 935 .</p>
   <p>The Third Fragment amounts to thirty-six lines , and may be taken as the first draft of the whole additions — lines 880-949 .</p>
   <p>Lines 908-925 and 936-945 of the text are still later additions , but a fourth MS. fragment supplies lines 920-925 and lines 936-945 . ( A fair copy of this fragment gives text for Revise of November 13 . ) Between November 13 and November 25 no less than ten revises of the Bride were submitted to Lord Byron . In the earliest of these , dated November 13 , the thirty-six lines of the Third Fragment have been expanded into forty lines — four lines of the MS. being omitted , and twelve lines , 908-919 , “ Once free , ” — “ social home , ” being inserted . The text passed through five revises and remained unaltered till November 21 , when eighteen lines were added to the forty , viz . : ( 4 ) “ Mark ! where his carnage , ” — “ sabre 's length ; ” ( 6 ) “ There ev'n thy soul , ” — “ Zuleika 's name ; ” and ( 8 ) “ Aye — let the loud winds , ” — “ bars escape . ” Of these the two latter additions belong to the Fourth Fragment . The text in this state passed through three more revises , but before the first edition was issued two more lines were added — lines 938 , 939 ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The deepest murmur of this lip shall be ,</l>
     <l n="2">No sigh for safety , but a prayer for thee ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Even then the six lines , “ Blest — as the Muezzin 's , ” — “ endears , ” are wanting in the text ; but the four lines , “ Soft — as the melody , ” — “ endears , ” are inserted in MS. in the margin . The text as it stands first appears in the Seventh Edition .</p>

   <note>The “ line of Carasman ” dates back to Kara Youlouk , the founder of the dynasty of the “ White Sheep , ” at the close of the fourteenth century . Hammer-Purgstall ( Hist . de l'Emp .

   <note>Passwan Oglou ( 1758-1807 ) [ Passewend 's , or the Watchman 's son , according to Hobhouse ] was born and died at Widdin . He first came into notice in 1788 , in alliance with certain disbanded Turkish levies , named Krdschalies . “ It was their pride to ride along on stately horses , with trappings of gold and silver , and bearing costly arms . In their train were female slaves , Giuvendi , in male attire , who not only served to amuse them in their hours of ease with singing and dancing , but also followed them to battle ( as Kaled followed Lara , see Lara , Canto II . stanza xv ., etc . ) , for the purpose of holding their horses when they fought . ” On one occasion he is reported to have addressed these “ rebel hordes ” much in the spirit of the “ Corsair , ” “ The booty be yours , and mine the glory . ” “ After having for some time suffered a Pacha to be associated with him , he at length expelled his superior , and demanded ‘ the three horse-tails ’ for himself . ” In 1798 the Porte despatched another army , but Passwan was completely victorious , and “ at length the Porte resolved to make peace , and actually sent him the ‘ three horse-tails ’ ” ( i. e . made him commander-in-chief of the Janissaries at Widdin ) .

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO THE CORSAIR .</p>
   <p>A seventh edition of the Giaour , including the final additions , and the first edition of the Bride of Abydos , were published on the twenty-ninth of November , 1813 . In less than three weeks ( December 18 ) Byron began the Corsair , and completed the fair copy of the first draft by the last day of the year . The Corsair in all but its final shape , together with the sixth edition of the Bride of Abydos , the seventh of Childe Harold , and the ninth of the Giaour , was issued on the first of February , 1814 .</p>
   <p>A letter from John Murray to Lord Byron , dated February 3 , 1814 ( Memoir of John Murray , 1891 , i . 223 ) , presents a vivid picture of a great literary triumph —</p>
   <p>“ My Lord ,— I have been unwilling to write until I had something to say .... I am most happy to tell you that your last poem is — what Mr. Southey 's is called — a Carmen Triumphale . Never in my recollection has any work ... excited such a ferment ... I sold on the day of publication — a thing perfectly unprecedented — 10 , 000 copies .... Mr. Moore says it is masterly — a wonderful performance . Mr. Hammond , Mr. Heber , D'Israeli , every one who comes ... declare their unlimited approbation . Mr. Ward was here with Mr. Gifford yesterday , and mingled his admiration with the rest ... and Gifford did , what I never knew him do before — he repeated several stanzas from memory , particularly the closing stanza —</p>
   <p>“ ‘ His death yet dubious , deeds too widely known . ’</p>
   <p>“ I have the highest encomiums in letters from Croker and Mr. Hay ; but I rest most upon the warm feeling it has created in Gifford 's critic heart .... You have no notion of the sensation which the publication has occasioned ; and my only regret is that you were not present to witness it . ”</p>
   <p>For some time before and after the poem appeared , Byron was , as he told Leigh Hunt ( February 9 , 1814 ; Letters , 1899 , iii . 27 ) , “ snow-bound and thaw-swamped in ‘ the valley of the shadow ’ of Newstead Abbey , ” and it was not till he had returned to town that he resumed his journal , and bethought him of placing on record some dark sayings with regard to the story of the Corsair and the personality of Conrad . Under date February 18 , 1814 , he writes —</p>
   <p>“ The Corsair has been conceived , written , published , etc ., since I last took up this journal [? last day but one ] . They tell me it has great success ; it was written con amore [ i. e . during the reign of Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster ] , and much from existence . ”</p>
   <p>And again , Journal , March 10 ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 399 ) ,</p>
   <p>“ He [ Hobhouse ] told me an odd report ,— that I am the actual Conrad , the veritable Corsair , and that part of my travels are supposed to have passed in privacy [ sic ;? piracy ] . Um ! people sometimes hit near the truth ; but never the whole truth . H. do n't know what I was about the year after he left the Levant ; nor does any one — nor — nor — nor — however , it is a lie — but , ‘ I doubt the equivocation of the fiend that lies like truth . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Very little weight can be attached to these “ I could an I would ” pronouncements , deliberately framed to provoke curiosity , and destined , no doubt , sooner or later to see the light ; but the fact remains that Conrad is not a mere presentation of Byron in a fresh disguise , or “ The Pirate 's Tale ” altogether a “ painting of the imagination . ”</p>
   <p>That the Corsair is founded upon fact is argued at some length by the author ( an “ English Gentleman in the Greek Military Service ” ) of the Life , Writings , Opinions , and Times of the R. H. George Gordon Noel Byron , which was published in 1825 . The point of the story ( i . 197-201 ) , which need not be repeated at length , is that Byron , on leaving Constantinople and reaching the island of Zea ( July , 1810 ) , visited [ “ strolled about ” ] the islands of the Archipelago , in company with a Venetian gentleman who had turned buccaneer malgré lui , and whose history and adventures , amatory and piratical , prefigured and inspired the “ gestes ” of Conrad . The tale must be taken for what it is worth ; but it is to be remarked that it affords a clue to Byron 's mysterious entries in a journal which did not see the light till 1830 , five years after the “ English Gentleman ” published his volumes of gossiping anecdote . It may , too , be noted that , although , in his correspondence of 1810 , 1811 , there is no mention of any tour among the “ Isles of Greece , ” in a letter to Moore dated February 2 , 1815 ( Letters , 1899 , iii . 176 ) , Byron recalls “ the interesting white squalls and short seas of Archipelago memory . ”</p>
   <p>How far Byron may have drawn on personal experience for his picture of a pirate chez lui , it is impossible to say ; but during the year 1809-11 , when he was travelling in Greece , the exploits of Lambros Katzones and other Greek pirates sailing under the Russian flag must have been within the remembrance and on the lips of the islanders and the “ patriots ” of the mainland . The “ Pirate 's Island , ” from which “ Ariadne 's isle ” ( line 444 ) was visible , may be intended for Paros or Anti-Paros .</p>
   <p>For the inception of Conrad ( see Canto I. stanza ii . ) , the paradoxical hero , an assortment rather than an amalgam of incongruous characteristics , Byron may , perhaps , have been in some measure indebted to the description of Malefort , junior , in Massinger 's Unnatural Combat , act i. sc . 2 , line 20 , sq .—</p>
   <p>“ I have sat with him in his cabin a day together ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sigh he did often , as if inward grief</l>
     <l n="2">And melancholy at that instant would</l>
     <l n="3">Choke up his vital spirits ....</l>
     <l n="4">When from the maintop</l>
     <l n="5">A sail 's descried , all thoughts that do concern</l>
     <l n="6">Himself laid by , no lion pinched with hunger</l>
     <l n="7">Rouses himself more fiercely from his den ,</l>
     <l n="8">Then he comes on the deck ; and then how wisely</l>
     <l n="9">He gives directions , ” etc .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Corsair , together with the Bride of Abydos , was reviewed by Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review of April , 1814 , vol . xxiii . p. 198 ; and together with Lara , by George Agar Ellis in the Quarterly Review of July , 1814 , vol . ii . p. 428 .</p>

    <head>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON THE CORSAIR .</head>
    <head>In comparison with the Giaour , the additions made to the Corsair whilst it was passing through the press were inconsiderable . The original MS ., which numbers 1737 lines , is probably the fair copy of a number of loose sheets which have not been preserved . The erasures are few and far between , and the variations between the copy and the text are neither numerous nor important .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In one of the latest revises stanza x. was added to the First Canto . The</l>
     <l n="2">last four lines of stanza xi . first appeared in the Seventh Edition .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The Second Canto suffered no alteration except the substitution of lines</l>
     <l n="4">1131-1133 for two lines which were expunged .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Larger additions were made to the Third Canto . Lines 1299-1375 , or stanza v. ( included in a revise dated January 6 , 1814 ) , stanzas xvii . and xxiii ., numbering respectively 77 , 32 , and 16 lines , and the two last lines of stanza x ., 127 lines in all , represent the difference between the text as it now stands and the original MS .</p>
   <p>In a note to Byron 's Poetical Works , 1832 , ix . 257 , it is stated that the Corsair was begun on the 18th and finished on the 31st of December , 1813 . In the Introduction to the Corsair prefixed to the Library Edition , the poem is said to have been composed in ten days , “ at the rate of 200 lines a day . ” The first page of the MS. is dated “ 27th of December , 1813 , ” and the last page “ December 31 , 1813 , January 1 , 1814 . ” It is probable that the composition of the first draft was begun on the 18th and finished on the 27th of December , and that the work of transcription occupied the last five days of the month . Stanza v. of Canto III . reached the publisher on the 6th , and stanzas xvii . and xxiii . on the 11th and 12th of January , 1814 .</p>
   <p>The First Edition amounted to 1859 lines ( the numeration , owing to the inclusion of broken lines , is given as 1863 ) , and falls short of the existing text by the last four lines of stanza xi . It contains the first dedication to Moore , and numbers 100 pages . To the Second Edition , which numbers 108 pages , the following poems were appended :—</p>
   <p>To a Lady Weeping .</p>
   <p>From the Turkish .</p>
   <p>Sonnet to Genevra ( “ Thine eyes ’ blue tenderness , ” etc . ) .</p>
   <p>Sonnet to Genevra ( “ Thy cheek is pale with thought , ” etc . ) .</p>
   <p>Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog .</p>
   <p>Farewell .</p>
   <p>These occasional poems were not appended to the Third Edition , which only numbered 100 pages ; but they reappeared in the Fourth and subsequent editions .</p>
   <p>The Seventh Edition contained four additional lines ( the last four of stanza xi . ) , and a note ( unnumbered ) to line 226 , in defence of the vraisemblance of the Corsair 's misanthropy . The Ninth Edition numbered 112 pages . The additional matter consists of a long note to the last line of the poem ( “ Linked with one virtue , and a thousand crimes ” ) on the pirates of Barataria .</p>
   <p>Twenty-five thousand copies of the Corsair were sold between January and March , 1814 . An Eighth Edition of fifteen hundred copies was printed in March , and sold before the end of the year . A Ninth Edition of three thousand copies was printed in the beginning of 1815 .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO THOMAS MOORE , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">My dear Moore ,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I dedicate to you the last production with which I shall trespass on public patience , and your indulgence , for some years ; and I own that I feel anxious to avail myself of this latest and only opportunity of adorning my pages with a name , consecrated by unshaken public principle , and the most undoubted and various talents . While Ireland ranks you among the firmest of her patriots ; while you stand alone the first of her bards in her estimation , and Britain repeats and ratifies the decree , permit one , whose only regret , since our first acquaintance , has been the years he had lost before it commenced , to add the humble but sincere suffrage of friendship , to the voice of more than one nation . It will at least prove to you , that I have neither forgotten the gratification derived from your society , nor abandoned the prospect of its renewal , whenever your leisure or inclination allows you to atone to your friends for too long an absence . It is said among those friends , I trust truly , that you are engaged in the composition of a poem whose scene will be laid in the East ; none can do those scenes so much justice . The wrongs of your own country ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 194 ]</span>the magnificent and fiery spirit of her sons , the beauty and feeling of her daughters , may there be found ; and Collins , when he denominated his Oriental his Irish Eclogues , was not aware how true , at least , was a part of his parallel . Your imagination will create a warmer sun , and less clouded sky ; but wildness , tenderness , and originality , are part of your national claim of oriental descent , to which you have already thus far proved your title more clearly than the most zealous of your country 's antiquarians .</p>
   <p>May I add a few words on a subject on which all men are supposed to be fluent , and none agreeable ?— Self . I have written much , and published more than enough to demand a longer silence than I now meditate ; but , for some years to come , it is my intention to tempt no further the award of “ Gods , men , nor columns . ” In the present composition I have attempted not the most difficult , but , perhaps , the best adapted measure to our language , the good old and now neglected heroic couplet . The stanza of Spenser is perhaps too slow and dignified for narrative ; though , I confess , it is the measure most after my own heart ; Scott alone ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 195 ]</span>of the present generation , has hitherto completely triumphed over the fatal facility of the octosyllabic verse ; and this is not the least victory of his fertile and mighty genius : in blank verse , Milton , Thomson , and our dramatists , are the beacons that shine along the deep , but warn us from the rough and barren rock on which they are kindled . The heroic couplet is not the most popular measure certainly ; but as I did not deviate into the other from a wish to flatter what is called public opinion , I shall quit it without further apology , and take my chance once more with that versification , in which I have hitherto published nothing but compositions whose former circulation is part of my present , and will be of my future regret .</p>
   <p>With regard to my story , and stories in general , I should have been glad to have rendered my personages more perfect and amiable , if possible , inasmuch as I have been sometimes criticised , and considered no less responsible for their deeds and qualities than if all had been personal . Be it so — if I have deviated into the gloomy vanity of “ drawing from self , ” the pictures are probably like , since they are unfavourable : and if not , those who know me are undeceived , and those who do not , I have little interest in undeceiving . I have no particular desire that any but my acquaintance should think the author better than the beings of his imagining ; but I cannot help a little surprise , and perhaps amusement , at some odd critical exceptions in the present instance , when I see several bards ( far more deserving , I allow ) in very reputable plight , and quite exempted from all participation in the faults of those heroes , who , nevertheless , might be found with little more morality than The Giaour , and perhaps — but no — I must admit Childe Harold to be a very repulsive personage ; and as to his identity , those who like it must give him whatever “ alias ” they please .<span type="note_anchor">[ 196 ]</span></p>
   <p>If , however , it were worth while to remove the impression , it might be of some service to me , that the man who is alike the delight of his readers and his friends , the poet of all circles , and the idol of his own , permits me here and elsewhere to subscribe myself ,</p>
   <p>Most truly , And affectionately , His obedient servant , BYRON . January 2 , 1814 .</p>

      <l n="1">“ O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea ,</l>
      <l n="2">Our thoughts as boundless , and our souls as free ,</l>
      <l n="3">Far as the breeze can bear , the billows foam ,</l>
      <l n="4">Survey our empire , and behold our home !<span type="note_anchor">[ 198 ]</span></l>
      <l n="5">These are our realms , no limits to their sway —</l>
      <l n="6">Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey .</l>
      <l n="7">Ours the wild life in tumult still to range</l>
      <l n="8">From toil to rest , and joy in every change .</l>
      <l n="9">Oh , who can tell ? not thou , luxurious slave !</l>
      <l n="10">Whose soul would sicken o'er the heaving wave ; 10</l>
      <l n="11">Not thou , vain lord of Wantonness and Ease !</l>
      <l n="12">Whom Slumber soothes not — Pleasure cannot please —</l>
      <l n="13">Oh , who can tell , save he whose heart hath tried ,</l>
      <l n="14">And danced in triumph o'er the waters wide ,</l>
      <l n="15">The exulting sense — the pulse 's maddening play ,</l>
      <l n="16">That thrills the wanderer of that trackless way ?</l>
      <l n="17">That for itself can woo the approaching fight ,</l>
      <l n="18">And turn what some deem danger to delight ;</l>
      <l n="19">That seeks what cravens shun with more than zeal ,</l>
      <l n="20">And where the feebler faint can only feel — 20</l>
      <l n="21">Feel — to the rising bosom 's inmost core ,</l>
      <l n="22">Its hope awaken and its spirit soar ?</l>
      <l n="23">No dread of Death — if with us die our foes —</l>
      <l n="24">Save that it seems even duller than repose ;</l>
      <l n="25">Come when it will — we snatch the life of Life —</l>
      <l n="26">When lost — what recks it by disease or strife ?</l>
      <l n="27">Let him who crawls , enamoured of decay ,</l>
      <l n="28">Cling to his couch , and sicken years away ; [ hk ]</l>
      <l n="29">Heave his thick breath , and shake his palsied head ;</l>
      <l n="30">Ours the fresh turf , and not the feverish bed ,— 30</l>
      <l n="31">While gasp by gasp he falters forth his soul ,</l>
      <l n="32">Ours with one pang — one bound — escapes control .</l>
      <l n="33">His corse may boast its urn and narrow cave ,</l>
      <l n="34">And they who loathed his life may gild his grave :</l>
      <l n="35">Ours are the tears , though few , sincerely shed ,</l>
      <l n="36">When Ocean shrouds and sepulchres our dead .</l>
      <l n="37">For us , even banquets fond regret supply</l>
      <l n="38">In the red cup that crowns our memory ;</l>
      <l n="39">And the brief epitaph in Danger 's day ,</l>
      <l n="40">When those who win at length divide the prey , 40</l>
      <l n="41">And cry , Remembrance saddening o'er each brow ,</l>
      <l n="42">How had the brave who fell exulted now ! ”</l>

      <l n="67">Ne'er for his lip the purpling cup they fill ,</l>
      <l n="68">That goblet passes him untasted still —</l>
      <l n="69">And for his fare — the rudest of his crew</l>
      <l n="70">Would that , in turn , have passed untasted too ; 70</l>
      <l n="71">Earth 's coarsest bread , the garden 's homeliest roots ,</l>
      <l n="72">And scarce the summer luxury of fruits ,</l>
      <l n="73">His short repast in humbleness supply</l>
      <l n="74">With all a hermit 's board would scarce deny .</l>
      <l n="75">But while he shuns the grosser joys of sense ,</l>
      <l n="76">His mind seems nourished by that abstinence .</l>

      <l n="78">“ Now form and follow me ! ” — the spoil is won .</l>
      <l n="79">Thus prompt his accents and his actions still ,</l>
      <l n="80">And all obey and few inquire his will ; 80</l>
      <l n="81">To such , brief answer and contemptuous eye</l>
      <l n="82">Convey reproof , nor further deign reply .</l>

      <l n="555">When echoed to the heart as from his own</l>
      <l n="556">His deep yet tender melody of tone : 550</l>
      <l n="557">But such was foreign to his wonted mood ,</l>

My praise could add nothing to your well-earned and firmly established fame ; and with my most hearty admiration of your talents , and delight in your conversation , you are already acquainted .

I find something not unlike it in history .— “ Anxious to explore with his own eyes the state of the Vandals , Majorian ventured , after disguising the colour of his hair , to visit Carthage in the character of his own ambassador ; and Genseric was afterwards mortified by the discovery , that he had entertained and dismissed the Emperor of the Romans .

   <note>238 ] { 295 } [ Byron had , perhaps , explored the famous stalactite cavern in the island of Anti-Paros , which is described by Tournefort , Clarke , Choiseul-Gouffier , and other travellers .</note>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 239 ]</span>{ 296 } That the point of honour which is represented in one instance of Conrad 's character has not been carried beyond the bounds of probability , may perhaps be in some degree confirmed by the following anecdote of a brother buccaneer in the year 1814 :— “ Our readers have all seen the account of the enterprise against the pirates of Barataria ; but few , we believe , were informed of the situation , history , or nature of that establishment . For the information of such as were unacquainted with it , we have procured from a friend the following interesting narrative of the main facts , of which he has personal knowledge , and which cannot fail to interest some of our readers :— Barataria is a bayou , or a narrow arm of the Gulf of Mexico ; it runs through a rich but very flat country , until it reaches within a mile of the Mississippi river , fifteen miles below the city of New Orleans . This bayou has branches almost innumerable , in which persons can lie concealed from the severest scrutiny . It communicates with three lakes which lie on the south-west side , and these , with the lake of the same name , and which lies contiguous to the sea , where there is an island formed by the two arms of this lake and the sea . The east and west points of this island were fortified , in the year 1811 , by a band of pirates , under the command of one Monsieur La Fitte . A large majority of these outlaws are of that class of the population of the state of Louisiana who fled from the island of St. Domingo during the troubles there , and took refuge in the island of Cuba ; and when the last war between France and Spain commenced , they were compelled to leave that island with the short notice of a few days . Without ceremony they entered the United States , the most of them the state of Louisiana , with all the negroes they had possessed in Cuba . They were notified by the Governor of that State of the clause in the constitution which forbade the importation of slaves ; but , at the same time , received the assurance of the Governor that he would obtain , if possible , the approbation of the General Government for their retaining this property .— The island of Barataria is situated about lat . 29 deg . 15 min ., lon . 92 . 30 .; and is as remarkable for its health as for the superior scale and shell fish with which its waters abound . The chief of this horde , like Charles de Moor , had , mixed with his many vices , some transcendant virtues . In the year 1813 , this party had , from its turpitude and boldness , claimed the attention of the Governor of Louisiana ; and to break up the establishment he thought proper to strike at the head . He therefore , offered a reward of 500 dollars for the head of Monsieur La Fitte , who was well known to the inhabitants of the city of New Orleans , from his immediate connection , and his once having been a fencing-master in that city of great reputation , which art he learnt in Buonaparte 's army , where he was a captain . The reward which was offered by the Governor for the head of La Fitte was answered by the offer of a reward from the latter of 15 , 000 for the head of the Governor . The Governor ordered out a company to march from the city to La Fitte 's island , and to burn and destroy all the property , and to bring to the city of New Orleans all his banditti . This company , under the command of a man who had been the intimate associate of this bold Captain , approached very near to the fortified island , before he saw a man , or heard a sound , until he heard a whistle , not unlike a boatswain 's call . Then it was he found himself surrounded by armed men who had emerged from the secret avenues which led to this bayou . Here it was that this modern Charles de Moor developed his few noble traits ; for to this man , who had come to destroy his life and all that was dear to him , he not only spared his life , but offered him that which would have made the honest soldier easy for the remainder of his days , which was indignantly refused . He then , with the approbation of his captor , returned to the city . This circumstance , and some concomitant events , proved that this band of pirates was not to be taken by land . Our naval force having always been small in that quarter , exertions for the destruction of this illicit establishment could not be expected from them until augmented ; for an officer of the navy , with most of the gun-boats on that station , had to retreat from an overwhelming force of La Fitte 's . So soon as the augmentation of the navy authorised an attack , one was made ; the overthrow of this banditti has been the result : and now this almost invulnerable point and key to New Orleans is clear of an enemy , it is to be hoped the government will hold it by a strong military force . ” — American Newspaper .</p>
   <note>The story of the “ Pirates of Barataria , ” which an American print , the National Intelligencer , was the first to make public , is quoted in extenso by the Weekly Messenger ( published at Boston ) of November 4 , 1814 . It is remarkable that a tale which was destined to pass into the domain of historical romance should have been instantly seized upon and turned to account by Byron , whilst it was as yet half-told , while the legend was still in the making . Jean Lafitte , the Franco-American Conrad , was born either at Bayonne or Bordeaux , circ . 1780 , emigrated with his elder brother Pierre , and settled at New Orleans , in 1809 , as a blacksmith . Legitimate trade was flat , but the delta of the Mississippi , with its labyrinth of creeks and islands and bayous , teemed with pirates or merchant-smugglers . Accordingly , under the nominal sanction of letters of marque from the Republic of Cartagena , and as belligerents of Spain , the brothers , who had taken up their quarters on Grande Terre , an island to the east of the “ Grand Pass , ” or channel of the Bay of Barataria , swept the Gulph of Mexico with an organised flotilla of privateers , and acquired vast booty in the way of specie and living cargoes of claves . Hence the proclamation of the Governor of Louisiana , W. C. C. Claiborne , in which ( November 24 , 1813 ) he offered a sum of $ 500 for the capture of Jean Lafitte . For the sequel of this first act of the drama the “ American newspaper ” is the sole authority . The facts , however , if facts they be , which are pieced together by Charles Étienne Arthur Gayarré , in the History of Louisiana ( 1885 , iv . 301 , sq . ) , and in two articles contributed to the American Magazine of History , October and November , 1883 , are as curious and romantic as the legend . It would appear that early in September , 1814 , a British officer , Colonel E. Nicholls , made overtures to Jean Lafitte , offering him the rank of captain in the British army , a grant of lands , and a sum of $ 30 , 000 if he would join forces with the British squadron then engaged in an attack on the coast of Louisiana . Lafitte begged for time to consider Colonel Nicholls 's proposal , but immediately put himself in communication with Claiborne , offering , on condition of immunity for past offences , to place his resources at the disposal of the United States . Claiborne 's reply to this patriotic offer seems to have been to despatch a strong naval force , under Commander Daniel Patterson , with orders to exterminate the pirates , and seize their fort on Grande Terre ; and , on this occasion , though the brothers escaped , the authorities were successful . A proclamation was issued by General Andrew Jackson , in which the pirates were denounced as “ hellish banditti , ” and , to all appearances , their career was at an end . But circumstances were in their favour , and a few weeks later Jackson not only went back on his own mandate , but accepted the alliance and services of the brothers Lafitte and their captains at the siege of New Orleans , January 8 , 1815 . Finally , when peace with Great Britain was concluded , President Madison publicly acknowledged the “ unequivocal traits of courage and fidelity ” which had been displayed by the brothers Lafitte , and the once proscribed band of outlaws . Thenceforth Pierre Lafitte disappears from history ; but Jean is believed to have settled first at Galveston , in Texas , and afterwards , in 1820 , on the coast of Yucatan , whence “ he continued his depredations on Spanish commerce . ” He died game , a pirate to the last , in 1826 . See , for what purports to be documentary evidence of the correspondence between Colonel E. Nicholls and Jean Lafitte , Historical Memoirs of the War in West Florida and Louisiana , by Major A . La Carriére Latour , 1816 , Appendix III . pp . vii. - xv . See , too , Fernando de Lemos ( an historical novel ) , by Charles Gayarré , 1872 , pp . 347-361 .</note>
   <p>In [ the Rev . Mark ] Noble 's continuation of “ Granger 's Biographical History ” [ of England , 1806 , iii . 68 ] , there is a singular passage in his account of Archbishop Blackbourne [ 1658-1743 ] ; and as in some measure connected with the profession of the hero of the foregoing poem , I cannot resist the temptation of extracting it .— “ There is something mysterious in the history and character of Dr. Blackbourne . The former is but imperfectly known ; and report has even asserted he was a buccaneer ; and that one of his brethren in that profession having asked , on his arrival in England , what had become of his old chum , Blackbourne , was answered , he is Archbishop of York . We are informed , that Blackbourne was installed sub-dean of Exeter in 1694 , which office he resigned in 1702 ; but after his successor Lewis Barnet 's death , in 1704 , he regained it . In the following year he became dean ; and in 1714 held with it the archdeanery [ i. e . archdeaconry ] of Cornwall . He was consecrated Bishop of Exeter , February 24 , 1716 ; and translated to York , November 28 , 1724 , as a reward , according to court scandal , for uniting George I. to the Duchess of Munster . This , however , appears to have been an unfounded calumny . As archbishop he behaved with great prudence , and was equally respectable as the guardian of the revenues of the see . Rumour whispered he retained the vices of his youth , and that a passion for the fair sex formed an item in the list of his weaknesses ; but so far from being convicted by seventy witnesses , he does not appear to have been directly criminated by one . In short , I look upon these aspersions as the effects of mere malice . How is it possible a buccaneer should have been so good a scholar as Blackbourne certainly was ? He who had so perfect a knowledge of the classics ( particularly of the Greek tragedians ) , as to be able to read them with the same ease as he could Shakespeare , must have taken great pains to acquire the learned languages ; and have had both leisure and good masters . But he was undoubtedly educated at Christ-church College , Oxford . He is allowed to have been a pleasant man ; this , however , was turned against him , by its being said , ‘ he gained more hearts than souls . ’ ”</p>
   <note>Walpole , in his Memoirs of the Reign of King George II ., 1847 , i . 87 , who makes himself the mouthpiece of these calumnies , says that Hayter , Bishop of Norwich , was “ a natural son of Blackbourne , the jolly old Archbishop of York , who had all the manners of a man of quality , though he had been a Buccaneer , and was a clergyman ; but he retained nothing of his first profession except his seraglio . ”</note>
   <p>“ The only voice that could soothe the passions of the savage ( Alphonso III . ) was that of an amiable and virtuous wife , the sole object of his love ; the voice of Donna Isabella , the daughter of the Duke of Savoy , and the grand-daughter of Philip II . King of Spain . Her dying words sunk deep into his memory [ A. D. 1626 , August 22 ] ; his fierce spirit melted into tears ; and , after the last embrace , Alphonso retired into his chamber to bewail his irreparable loss , and to meditate on the vanity of human life . ” — Gibbon 's Miscellaneous Works [ 1837 , p. 831 ] .</p>

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO THE ODE TO NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE .</p>
   <p>The dedication of the Corsair , dated January 2 , 1814 , contains one of Byron 's periodical announcements that he is about , for a time , to have done with authorship — some years are to elapse before he will again “ trespass on public patience . ”</p>
   <p>Three months later he was , or believed himself to be , in the same mind . In a letter to Moore , dated April 9 , 1814 ( Letters , 1899 , iii . 64 ) , he writes , “ No more rhyme for — or rather , from — me . I have taken my leave of that stage , and henceforth will mountebank it no longer . ” He had already — Journal , April 8 ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 408 ) — heard a rumour “ that his poor little pagod , Napoleon ” was “ pushed off his pedestal , ” and before or after he began his letter to Moore he must have read an announcement in the Gazette Extraordinary ( April 9 , 1814 — the abdication was signed April 11 ) that Napoleon had abdicated the “ throne of the world , ” and declined upon the kingdom of Elba . On the next day , April 10 , he wrote two notes to Murray , to inform him that he had written an “ ode on the fall of Napoleon , ” that Murray could print it or not as he pleased ; but that if it appeared by itself , it was to be published anonymously . A first edition consisting of fifteen stanzas , and numbering fourteen pages , was issued on the 16th of April , 1814 . A second edition followed immediately , but as publications of less than a sheet were liable to the stamp tax on newspapers , at Murray 's request , another stanza , the fifth , was inserted in a later ( between the second and the twelfth ) edition , and , by this means , the pamphlet was extended to seventeen pages . The concluding stanzas xvii ., xviii ., xix ., which Moore gives in a note ( Life , p. 249 ) , were not printed in Byron 's lifetime , but were first included , in a separate poem , in Murray 's edition of 1831 , and first appended to the Ode in the seventeen-volume edition of 1832 .</p>
   <p>Although he had stipulated that the Ode should be published anonymously , Byron had no objection to “ its being said to be mine . ” There was , in short , no secret about it , and notices on the whole favourable appeared in the Morning Chronicle , April 21 , in the Examiner , April 24 ( in which Leigh Hunt combated Byron 's condemnation of Buonaparte for not “ dying as honour dies ” ) , and in the Anti-Jacobin for May , 1814 ( Letters , 1899 , iii . 73 , note 3 ) .</p>
   <p>Byron 's repeated resolutions and promises to cease writing and publishing , which sound as if they were only made to be broken , are somewhat exasperating , and if , as he pleaded in his own behalf , the occasion ( of Napoleon 's abdication ) was physically irresistible , it is to be regretted that he did not swerve from his self-denying ordinance to better purpose . The note of disillusionment and disappointment in the Ode is but an echo of the sentiments of the “ general . ” Napoleon on his own “ fall ” is more original and more interesting : “ Il céda , ” writes Léonard Gallois ( Histoire de Napoléon d'après luihYpppHeNmême , 1825 , pp . 546 , 547 ) , “ non sans de grands combats intérieurs , et la dicta en ces termes .</p>
   <p>‘ Les puissances alliées ayant proclamé que l'empereur Napoléon était le seul obstacle au rétablissement , de la paix en Europe , l'empereur Napoléon fidèle à son serment , déclare qu'il renonce , pour lui et ses héritiers , aux trônes de France et d'Italie , parce qu'il n'est aucun sacrifice personnel , même celui de la vie , qu'il ne soit prêt à faire à l'intérêt de la France .</p>

   <p>LARA :</p>
   <p>A TALE .</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION TO LARA</p>
   <p>The MS. of Lara is dated May 14 , 1814 . The opening lines , which were not prefixed to the published poem , and were first printed in Murray 's Magazine ( January , 1887 ) , are of the nature of a Dedication . They were probably written a few days after the well-known song , “ I speak not , I trace not , I breathe not thy name , ” which was enclosed to Moore in a letter dated May 4 , 1814 . There can be little doubt that both song and dedication were addressed to Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster , and that Lara , like the Corsair and the Bride of Abydos , was written con amore , and because the poet was “ eating his heart away . ”</p>
   <p>By the 14th of June Byron was able to announce to Moore that “ Lara was finished , and that he had begun copying . ” It was written , owing to the length of the London season , “ amidst balls and fooleries , and after coming home from masquerades and routs , in the summer of the sovereigns ” ( Letter to Moore , June 8 , 1822 , Life , p. 561 ) .</p>
   <p>By way of keeping his engagement — already broken by the publication of the Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte — not to “ trespass on public patience , ” Byron began by protesting ( June 14 ) that Lara was not to be published separately , but “ might be included in a third volume now collecting . ” A fortnight later ( June 27 ) an interchange of unpublished poems between himself and Rogers , “ two cantos of darkness and dismay ” in return for a privately printed copy of Jacqueline , who is “ all grace and softness and poetry ” ( Letter to Rogers , Letters , 1899 , iii . 101 ) , suggested another and happier solution of the difficulty , a coalescing with Rogers , and , if possible , Moore ( Life , 1892 , p. 257 , note 2 ) , “ into a joint invasion of the public ” ( Letter to Moore , July 8 , 1814 , Letters , 1899 , iii . 102 ) . But Rogers hesitated , and Moore refused to embark on so doubtful a venture , with the result that , as late as the 3rd of August , Byron thought fit to remonstrate with Murray for “ advertising Lara and Jacqueline , ” and confessed to Moore that he was “ still demurring and delaying and in a fuss ” ( Letters , 1899 , iii . 115 , 119 ) . Murray knew his man , and , though he waited for Byron 's formal and ostensibly reluctant word of command , “ Out with Lara , since it must be ” ( August 5 , 1814 , Letters , 1899 , iii . 122 ) , he admitted ( August 6 , Memoir of John Murray , 1891 , i . 230 ) that he had “ anticipated his consent , ” and “ had done everything but actually deliver the copies of Lara . ” “ The moment , ” he adds , “ I received your letter , for for it I waited , I cut the last cord of my aerial work , and at this instant 6000 copies are sold . ” Lara , a Tale ; Jacqueline , a Tale , was published on Saturday , August 6 , 1814 .</p>
   <p>Jacqueline is a somewhat insipid pastoral , betraying the influence of the Lake School , more especially Coleridge , on a belated and irresponsive disciple , and wholly out of place as contrast or foil to the melodramatic Lara .</p>
   <p>No sooner had the “ lady , ” as Byron was pleased to call her , played her part as decoy , than she was discharged as emerita . A week after publication ( August 12 , 1814 , Letters , iii . 125 ) Byron told Moore that “ Murray talks of divorcing Larry and Jacky — a bad sign for the authors , who will , I suppose , be divorced too .... Seriously , I do n't care a cigar about it . ” The divorce was soon pronounced , and , contrary to Byron 's advice ( September 2 , 1814 , Letters , iii . 131 ) , at least four separate editions of Lara were published during the autumn of 1814 .</p>
   <p>The “ advertisement ” to Lara and Jacqueline contains the plain statement that “ the reader ... may probably regard it [ Lara ] as a sequel to the Corsair ” — an admission on the author 's part which forestalls and renders nugatory any prolonged discussion on the subject . It is evident that Lara is Conrad , and that Kaled , the “ darkly delicate ” and mysterious page , whose “ hand is femininely white , ” is Gulnare in a transparent and temporary disguise .</p>
   <p>If the facts which the “ English Gentleman in the Greek Military Service ” ( Life , Writings , etc ., of Lord Byron , 1825 , i . 191-201 ) gives in detail with regard to the sources of the Corsair are not wholly imaginary , it is possible that the original Conrad 's determination to “ quit so horrible a mode of life ” and return to civilization may have suggested to Byron the possible adventures and fate of a grand seigneur who had played the pirate in his time , and resumed his ancestral dignities only to be detected and exposed by some rival or victim of his wild and lawless youth .</p>
   <p>Lara was reviewed together with the Corsair , by George Agar Ellis in the Quarterly Review for July , 1814 , vol . xi . p. 428 ; and in the Portfolio , vol . xiv . p. 33 .</p>

      <l n="1210">Himself unheeded watched the stranger 's course ,</l>
      <l n="1211">Who reached the river , bounded from his horse , 1210</l>
      <l n="1212">And lifting thence the burthen which he bore ,</l>
      <l n="1213">Heaved up the bank , and dashed it from the shore ,</l>

      <l n="1215">And still another hurried glance would snatch ,</l>
      <l n="1216">And follow with his step the stream that flowed ,</l>
      <l n="1217">As if even yet too much its surface showed ;</l>
      <l n="1218">At once he started — stooped — around him strown</l>
      <l n="1219">The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone :</l>

      <l n="1227">A massy fragment smote it , and it sunk :[ lb ]</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 265 ]</span>[ A revised version of the following “ Advertisement ” was prefixed to the First Edition ( Printed for J. Murray , Albemarle Street , By T. Davison , Whitefriars , 1814 ) , which was accompanied by Jacqueline :—</p>
   <p>“ The Reader — if the tale of Lara has the fortune to meet with one — may probably regard it as a sequel to the Corsair ;— the colouring is of a similar cast , and although the situations of the characters are changed , the stories are in some measure connected . The countenance is nearly the same — but with a different expression . To the readers ’ conjecture are left the name of the writer and the failure or success of his attempt — the latter are the only points upon which the author or his judges can feel interested .</p>
   <p>“ The Poem of Jaqueline is the production of a different author and is added at the request of the writer of the former tale , whose wish and entreaty it was that it should occupy the first pages of the following volume , and he regrets that the tenacious courtesy of his friend would not permit him to place it where the judgement of the reader concurring with his own will suggest its more appropriate station . ” ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 266 ]</span>The reader is apprised , that the name of Lara being Spanish , and no circumstance of local and natural description fixing the scene or hero of the poem to any country or age , the word “ Serf , ” which could not be correctly applied to the lower classes in Spain , who were never vassals of the soil , has nevertheless been employed to designate the followers of our fictitious chieftain .</p>
   <note>Byron , writing to Murray , July 14 , 1814 , says , “ The name only is Spanish ; the country is not Spain , but the Moon ” ( not “ Morea , ” as hitherto printed ) .— Letters , 1899 , iii . 110 . The MS. is dated May 15 , 1814 .</note>

   <note>286 ] The event in this section was suggested by the description of the death or rather burial of the Duke of Gandia . “ The most interesting and particular account of it is given by Burchard , and is in substance as follows :— ‘ On the eighth day of June , the Cardinal of Valenza and the Duke of Gandia , sons of the pope , supped with their mother , Vanozza , near the church of S. Pietro ad vincula : several other persons being present at the entertainment . A late hour approaching , and the cardinal having reminded his brother that it was time to return to the apostolic palace , they mounted their horses or mules , with only a few attendants , and proceeded together as far as the palace of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza , when the duke informed the cardinal that , before he returned home , he had to pay a visit of pleasure . Dismissing therefore all his attendants , excepting his staffiero , or footman , and a person in a mask , who had paid him a visit whilst at supper , and who , during the space of a month or thereabouts , previous to this time , had called upon him almost daily at the apostolic palace , he took this person behind him on his mule , and proceeded to the street of the Jews , where he quitted his servant , directing him to remain there until a certain hour ; when , if he did not return , he might repair to the palace . The duke then seated the person in the mask behind him , and rode I know not whither ; but in that night he was assassinated , and thrown into the river . The servant , after having been dismissed , was also assaulted and mortally wounded ; and although he was attended with great care , yet such was his situation , that he could give no intelligible account of what had befallen his master . In the morning , the duke not having returned to the palace , his servants began to be alarmed ; and one of them informed the pontiff of the evening excursion of his sons , and that the duke had not yet made his appearance . This gave the pope no small anxiety ; but he conjectured that the duke had been attracted by some courtesan to pass the night with her , and , not choosing to quit the house in open day , had waited till the following evening to return home . When , however , the evening arrived , and he found himself disappointed in his expectations , he became deeply afflicted , and began to make inquiries from different persons , whom he ordered to attend him for that purpose . Amongst these was a man named Giorgio Schiavoni , who , having discharged some timber from a bark in the river , had remained on board the vessel to watch it ; and being interrogated whether he had seen any one thrown into the river on the night preceding , he replied , that he saw two men on foot , who came down the street , and looked diligently about to observe whether any person was passing . That seeing no one , they returned , and a short time afterwards two others came , and looked around in the same manner as the former : no person still appearing , they gave a sign to their companions , when a man came , mounted on a white horse , having behind him a dead body , the head and arms of which hung on one side , and the feet on the other side of the horse ; the two persons on foot supporting the body , to prevent its falling . They thus proceeded towards that part where the filth of the city is usually discharged into the river , and turning the horse , with his tail towards the water , the two persons took the dead body by the arms and feet , and with all their strength flung it into the river . The person on horseback then asked if they had thrown it in ; to which they replied , Signor , si ( yes , Sir ) . He then looked towards the river , and seeing a mantle floating on the stream , he enquired what it was that appeared black , to which they answered , it was a mantle ; and one of them threw stones upon it , in consequence of which it sunk . The attendants of the pontiff then enquired from Giorgio , why he had not revealed this to the governor of the city ; to which he replied , that he had seen in his time a hundred dead bodies thrown into the river at the same place , without any inquiry being made respecting them ; and that he had not , therefore , considered it as a matter of any importance . The fishermen and seamen were then collected , and ordered to search the river , where , on the following evening , they found the body of the duke , with his habit entire , and thirty ducats in his purse . He was pierced with nine wounds , one of which was in his throat , the others in his head , body , and limbs . No sooner was the pontiff informed of the death of his son , and that he had been thrown , like filth , into the river , than , giving way to his grief , he shut himself up in a chamber , and wept bitterly . The Cardinal of Segovia , and other attendants on the pope , went to the door , and after many hours spent in persuasions and exhortations , prevailed upon him to admit them . From the evening of Wednesday till the following Saturday the pope took no food ; nor did he sleep from Thursday morning till the same hour on the ensuing day . At length , however , giving way to the entreaties of his attendants , he began to restrain his sorrow , and to consider the injury which his own health might sustain by the further indulgence of his grief . ’ ” — Roscoe 's Life and Pontificate of Leo Tenth , 1805 , i . 265 .

   <p>HEBREW MELODIES</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION TO HEBREW MELODIES</p>
   <p>According to the “ Advertisement ” prefixed to Murray 's First Edition of the Hebrew Melodies , London , 1815 ( the date , January , 1815 , was appended in 1832 ) , the “ poems were written at the request of the author 's friend , the Hon . D. Kinnaird , for a selection of Hebrew Melodies , and have been published , with the music , arranged by Mr. Braham and Mr. Nathan . ”</p>
   <p>Byron 's engagement to Miss Milbanke took place in September , 1814 , and the remainder of the year was passed in London , at his chambers in the Albany . The so-called Hebrew Melodies were , probably , begun in the late autumn of that year , and were certainly finished at Seaham , after his marriage had taken place , in January-February , 1815 . It is a natural and pardonable conjecture that Byron took to writing sacred or , at any rate , scriptural verses by way of giving pleasure and doing honour to his future wife , “ the girl who gave to song What gold could never buy . ” They were , so to speak , the first-fruits of a seemlier muse .</p>
   <p>It is probable that the greater number of these poems were in MS. before it occurred to Byron 's friend and banker , the Honble . Douglas James William Kinnaird ( 1788-1830 ) , to make him known to Isaac Nathan ( 1792-1864 ) , a youthful composer of “ musical farces and operatic works , ” who had been destined by his parents for the Hebrew priesthood , but had broken away , and , after some struggles , succeeded in qualifying himself as a musician .</p>
   <p>Byron took a fancy to Nathan , and presented him with the copyright of his “ poetical effusions , ” on the understanding that they were to be set to music and sung in public by John Braham . “ Professional occupations ” prevented Braham from fulfilling his part of the engagement , but a guinea folio ( Part . I . ) ( “ Selections of Hebrew Melodies , Ancient and Modern , with appropriate symphonies and accompaniments , by I. Braham and I. Nathan , the poetry written expressly for the work by the Right Honourable Lord Byron ” ) — with an ornamental title-page designed by the architect Edward Blore ( 1789-1879 ) , and dedicated to the Princess Charlotte of Wales — was published in April , 1815 . A second part was issued in 1816 .</p>
   <p>The preface , part of which was reprinted ( p . vi . ) by Nathan , in his Fugitive Pieces and Reminiscences of Lord Byron , London , 1829 , is not without interest —</p>
   <p>“ The Hebrew Melodies are a selection from the favourite airs which are still sung in the religious ceremonies of the Jews . Some of these have , in common with all their Sacred airs , been preserved by memory and tradition alone , without the assistance of written characters . Their age and originality , therefore , must be left to conjecture . But the latitude given to the taste and genius of their performers has been the means of engrafting on the original Melodies a certain wildness and pathos , which have at length become the chief characteristics of the sacred songs of the Jews ....</p>
   <p>“ Of the poetry it is necessary to speak , in order thus publicly to acknowledge the kindness with which Lord Byron has condescended to furnish the most valuable part of the work . It has been our endeavour to select such melodies as would best suit the style and sentiment of the poetry . ”</p>
   <p>Moore , for whose benefit the Melodies had been rehearsed , was by no means impressed by their “ wildness and pathos , ” and seems to have twitted Byron on the subject , or , as he puts it ( Life , p. 276 ) , to have taken the liberty of “ laughing a little at the manner in which some of the Hebrew Melodies had been set to music . ” The author of Sacred Songs ( 1814 ) set to airs by Beethoven , Mozart , Haydn , etc ., was a critic not to be gainsaid , but from the half-comical petulance with which he “ curses ” and “ sun-burns ” ( Letters to Moore , February 22 , March 8 , 1815 , Letters , 1899 , iii . 179 , 183 ) Nathan , and his “ vile Ebrew nasalities , ” it is evident that Byron winced under Moore 's “ chaff . ”</p>
   <p>Apart from the merits or demerits of the setting , the title Hebrew Melodies is somewhat misleading . Three love-songs , “ She walks in Beauty like the Night , ” “ Oh ! snatched away in Beauty 's Bloom , ” and “ I saw thee weep , ” still form part of the collection ; and , in Nathan 's folio ( which does not contain “ A spirit passed before me ” ) , two fragments , “ It is the hour when from the boughs ” and “ Francesca walks in the shadow of night , ” which were afterwards incorporated in Parisina , were included . The Fugitive Pieces , 1829 , retain the fragments from Parisina , and add the following hitherto unpublished poems : “ I speak not , I trace not , ” etc ., “ They say that Hope is Happiness , ” and the genuine but rejected Hebrew Melody “ In the valley of waters we wept on the day . ”</p>
   <p>It is uncertain when Murray 's first edition appeared . Byron wrote to Nathan with regard to the copyright in January , 1815 ( Letters , 1899 , iii . 167 ) , but it is unlikely that the volume was put on the market before Nathan 's folio , which was advertised for the first time in the Morning Chronicle , April 6 , 1815 ; and it is possible that the first public announcement of the Hebrew Melodies , as a separate issue , was made in the Courier , June 22 , 1815 .</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Melodies were reviewed in the Christian Observer , August , 1815 , vol . xiv . p. 542 ; in the Analectic Magazine , October , 1815 , vol . vi . p. 292 ; and were noticed by Jeffrey [ The Hebrew Melodies , though “ obviously inferior ” to Lord Byron 's other works , “ display a skill in versification and a mastery in diction which would have raised an inferior artist to the very summit of distinction ” ] in the Edinburgh Review , December , 1816 , vol . xxvii . p. 291 .</p>

When we returned to ... the Albany , he ... desired Fletcher to give him a tumbler of brandy , which he drank at once to Mrs. Wilmot 's health ....

   </lg>
   <p>INTRODUCTION TO THE SIEGE OF CORINTH .</p>
   <p>In a note to the “ Advertisement ” to the Siege of Corinth ( vide post , p. 447 ) , Byron puts it on record that during the years 1809-10 he had crossed the Isthmus of Corinth eight times , and in a letter to his mother , dated Patras , July 30 , 1810 , he alludes to a recent visit to the town of Corinth , in company with his friend Lord Sligo . ( See , too , his letter to Coleridge , dated October 27 , 1815 , Letters , 1899 , iii . 228 . ) It is probable that he revisited Corinth more than once in the autumn of 1810 ; and we may infer that , just as the place and its surroundings — the temple with its “ two or three columns ” ( line 497 ) , and the view across the bay from Acro-Corinth — are sketched from memory , so the story of the siege which took place in 1715 is based upon tales and legends which were preserved and repeated by the grandchildren of the besieged , and were taken down from their lips . There is point and meaning in the apparently insignificant line ( stanza xxiv . line 765 ) , “ We have heard the hearers say ” ( see variant i. p. 483 ) , which is slipped into the description of the final catastrophe . It bears witness to the fact that the Siege of Corinth is not a poetical expansion of a chapter in history , but a heightened reminiscence of local tradition .</p>
   <p>History has , indeed , very little to say on the subject . The anonymous Compleat History of the Turks ( London , 1719 ) , which Byron quotes as an authority , is meagre and inaccurate . Hammer-Purgstall ( Histoire de l'Empire Ottoman , 1839 , xiii . 269 ) , who gives as his authorities Girolamo Ferrari and Raschid , dismisses the siege in a few lines ; and it was not till the publication of Finlay 's History of Greece ( vol . v ., a. d. 1453-1821 ) , in 1856 , that the facts were known or reported . Finlay 's newly discovered authority was a then unpublished MS. of a journal kept by Benjamin Brue , a connection of Voltaire 's , who accompanied the Grand Vizier , Ali Cumurgi , as his interpreter , on the expedition into the Morea . According to Brue ( Journal de la Campagne ... en 1715 ... Paris , 1870 , p. 18 ) , the siege began on June 28 , 1715 . A peremptory demand on the part of the Grand Vizier to surrender at discretion was answered by the Venetian proveditor-general , Giacomo Minetto , with calm but assured defiance ( “ Your menaces are useless , for we are prepared to resist all your attacks , and , with confidence in the assistance of God , we will preserve this fortress to the most serene Republic . God is with us ” ) . Nevertheless , the Turks made good their threat , and on the 2nd of July the fortress capitulated . On the following day at noon , whilst a party of Janissaries , contrary to order , were looting and pillaging in all directions , the fortress was seen to be enveloped in smoke . How or why the explosion happened was never discovered , but the result was that some of the pillaging Janissaries perished , and that others , to avenge their death , which they attributed to Venetian treachery , put the garrison to the sword . It was believed at the time that Minetto was among the slain ; but , as Brue afterwards discovered , he was secretly conveyed to Smyrna , and ultimately ransomed by the Dutch Consul .</p>
   <p>The late Professor Kölbing ( Siege of Corinth , 1893 , p . xxvii . ) , in commenting on the sources of the poem , suggests , under reserve , that Byron may have derived the incident of Minetto 's self-immolation from an historic source — the siege of Zsigetvar , in 1566 , when a multitude of Turks perished from the explosion of a powder magazine which had been fired at the cost of his own life by the Hungarian commander Zrini .</p>
   <p>It is , at least , equally probable that local patriotism was , in the first instance , responsible for the poetic colouring , and that Byron supplemented the meagre and uninteresting historic details which were at his disposal by “ intimate knowledge ” of the Corinthian version of the siege . ( See Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Right Hon . Lord Byron , London , 1822 , p. 222 ; and Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Lord Byron , by George Clinton , London , 1825 , p . 284 . )</p>
   <p>It has been generally held that the Siege of Corinth was written in the second half of 1815 ( Kölbing 's Siege of Corinth , p . vii . ) . “ It appears , ” says John Wright ( Works , 1832 , x . 100 ) , “ by the original MS ., to have been begun in July , 1815 ; ” and Moore ( Life , p. 307 ) , who probably relied on the same authority , speaks of “ both the Siege of Corinth and Parisina having been produced but a short time before the Separation ” ( i. e . spring , 1816 ) . Some words which Medwin ( Conversations , 1824 , p. 55 ) puts into Byron 's mouth point to the same conclusion . Byron 's own testimony , which is completely borne out by the MS. itself ( dated J ^ y [ i. e . January , not July ] 31 , 1815 ) , is in direct conflict with these statements . In a note to stanza xix . lines 521-532 ( vide post , pp . 471-473 ) he affirms that it “ was not till after these lines were written ” that he heard “ that wild and singularly original and beautiful poem [ Christabel ] recited ; ” and in a letter to S. T. Coleridge , dated October 27 , 1815 ( Letters , 1899 , iii . 228 ) , he is careful to explain that “ the enclosed extract from an unpublished poem ( i. e . stanza xix . lines 521-532 ) ... was written before ( not seeing your Christabelle [ sic ] , for that you know I never did till this day ) , but before I heard Mr. S [ cott ] repeat it , which he did in June last , and this thing was begun in January , and more than half written before the Summer . ” The question of plagiarism will be discussed in an addendum to Byron 's note on the lines in question ; but , subject to the correction that it was , probably , at the end of May ( see Lockhart 's Memoir of the Life of Sir W. Scott , 1871 , pp . 311-313 ) , not in June , that Scott recited Christabel for Byron 's benefit , the date of the composition of the poem must be determined by the evidence of the author himself .</p>
   <p>The copy of the MS. of the Siege of Corinth was sent to Murray at the beginning ( probably on the 2nd , the date of the copy ) of November , and was placed in Gifford 's hands about the same time ( see letter to Murray , November 4 , 1815 , Letters , 1899 , iii . 245 ; and Murray 's undated letter on Gifford 's “ great delight ” in the poem , and his “ three critical remarks , ” Memoir of John Murray , 1891 , i . 356 ) . As with Lara , Byron began by insisting that the Siege should not be published separately , but slipped into a fourth volume of the collected works , and once again ( possibly when he had at last made up his mind to accept a thousand guineas for his own requirements , and not for other beneficiaries — Godwin , Coleridge , or Maturin ) yielded to his publisher 's wishes and representations . At any rate , the Siege of Corinth and Parisina , which , says Moore , “ during the month of January and part of February were in the hands of the printers ” ( Life , p. 300 ) , were published in a single volume on February 7 , 1816 . The greater reviews were silent , but notices appeared in numerous periodicals ; e. g . the Monthly Review , February , 1816 , vol . lxxix . p. 196 ; the Eclectic Review , March , 1816 , N. S . vol . v. p. 269 ; the European , May , 1816 , vol . lxxix . p. 427 ; the Literary Panorama , June , 1816 , N. S . vol . iv . p. 418 ; etc . Many of these reviews took occasion to pick out and hold up to ridicule the illogical sentences , the grammatical solecisms , and general imperfections of technique which marked and disfigured the Siege of Corinth . A passage in a letter which John Murray wrote to his brother-publisher , William Blackwood ( Annals of a Publishing House , 1897 , i . 53 ) , refers to these cavillings , and suggests both an apology and a retaliation —</p>
   <p>“ Many who by ‘ numbers judge a poet 's song ’ are so stupid as not to see the powerful effect of the poems , which is the great object of poetry , because they can pick out fifty careless or even bad lines . The words may be carelessly put together ; but this is secondary . Many can write polished lines who will never reach the name of poet . You see it is all poetically conceived in Lord B . ' s mind . ”</p>
   <p>In such wise did Murray bear testimony to Byron 's “ splendid and imperishable excellence , which covers all his offences and outweighs all his defects — the excellence of sincerity and strength . ”</p>

   <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
   <p>“ The grand army of the Turks ( in 1715 ) , under the Prime Vizier , to open to themselves a way into the heart of the Morea , and to form the siege of Napoli di Romania , the most considerable place in all that country ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 331 ]</span>thought it best in the first place to attack Corinth , upon which they made several storms . The garrison being weakened , and the governor seeing it was impossible to hold out such a place against so mighty a force , thought it fit to beat a parley : but while they were treating about the articles , one of the magazines in the Turkish camp , wherein they had six hundred barrels of powder , blew up by accident , whereby six or seven hundred men were killed ; which so enraged the infidels , that they would not grant any capitulation , but stormed the place with so much fury , that they took it , and put most of the garrison , with Signior Minotti , the governor , to the sword . The rest , with Signior or Antonio Bembo , Proveditor Extraordinary , were made prisoners of war . ” — A Compleat History of the Turks [ London , 1719 ] , iii . 151 .</p>

Napoli is near Argos . I visited all three in 1810-11 ; and , in the course of journeying through the country from my first arrival in 1809 , I crossed the Isthmus eight times in my way from Attica to the Morea , over the mountains ; or in the other direction , when passing from the Gulf of Athens to that of Lepanto . Both the routes are picturesque and beautiful , though very different : that by sea has more sameness ; but the voyage , being always within sight of land , and often very near it , presents many attractive views of the islands Salamis , Ægina , Poros , etc ., and the coast of the Continent .</p>
   <note>“ Independently of the suitableness of such an event to the power of Lord Byron 's genius , the Fall of Corinth afforded local attractions , by the intimate knowledge which the poet had of the place and surrounding objects .... Thus furnished with that topographical information which could not be well obtained from books and maps , he was admirably qualified to depict the various operations and progress of the siege . ” — Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Right Honourable Lord Byron , London , 1822 , p. 222 .</note>

The sheets on which Gifford 's corrections are scrawled are not proof-sheets , but pages torn out of the first edition ; and it is probable that they were made after the poem was published , and with a view to the inclusion of an emended edition in the collected works .

   <p>Byron ( vide ante , p. 443 ) , in a letter to Coleridge , dated October 27 , 1815 , had already expressly guarded himself against a charge of plagiarism , by explaining that lines 521-532 of stanza xix . were written before he heard Walter Scott repeat Christabel in the preceding June . Now , as Byron himself perceived , perhaps for the first time , when he had the MS. of Christabel before him , the coincidence in language and style between the two passages is unquestionable ; and , as he hoped and expected that Coleridge 's fragment , when completed , would issue from the press , he was anxious to avoid even the semblance of pilfering , and went so far as to suggest that the passage should be cancelled . Neither in the private letter nor the published note does Byron attempt to deny or explain away the coincidence , but pleads that his lines were written before he had heard Coleridge 's poem recited , and that he had not been guilty of a “ wilful plagiarism . ” There is no difficulty in accepting his statement . Long before the summer of 1815 Christabel “ had a pretty general circulation in the literary world ” ( Medwin , Conversations , 1824 , p. 261 ) , and he may have heard without heeding this and other passages quoted by privileged readers ; or , though never a line of Christabel had sounded in his ears , he may ( as Kölbing points out ) have caught its lilt at second hand from the published works of Southey , or of Scott himself .</p>

I am glad of it ; but it is not original — at least not mine ; it may be found much better expressed in pages 182-3-4 of the English version of “ Vathek ” ( I forget the precise page of the French ) , a work to which I have before referred ; and never recur to , or read , without a renewal of gratification .— [ The following is the passage : “ ‘ Deluded prince ! ’ said the Genius , addressing the Caliph ... ‘ This moment is the last , of grace , allowed thee : ... give back Nouronihar to her father , who still retains a few sparks of life : destroy thy tower , with all its abominations : drive Carathis from thy councils : be just to thy subjects : respect the ministers of the Prophet : compensate for thy impieties by an exemplary life ; and , instead of squandering thy days in voluptuous indulgence , lament thy crimes on the sepulchres of thy ancestors . Thou beholdest the clouds that obscure the sun : at the instant he recovers his splendour , if thy heart be not changed , the time of mercy assigned thee will be past for ever . ’ ”</p>
   <p>“ Vathek , depressed with fear , was on the point of prostrating himself at the feet of the shepherd ... but , his pride prevailing ... he said , ‘ Whoever thou art , withhold thy useless admonitions .... If what I have done be so criminal ... there remains not for me a moment of grace . I have traversed a sea of blood to acquire a power which will make thy equals tremble ; deem not that I shall retire when in view of the port ; or that I will relinquish her who is dearer to me than either my life or thy mercy . Let the sun appear ! let him illumine my career ! it matters not where it may end ! ’ On uttering these words ... Vathek ... commanded that his horses should be forced back to the road .</p>
   <p>“ There was no difficulty in obeying these orders ; for the attraction had ceased ; the sun shone forth in all his glory , and the shepherd vanished with a lamentable scream ” ( ed . 1786 , pp . 183-185 ) . ]</p>

   <p>A sentence in a letter to Moore , dated January 10 , 1815 ( Letters , 1899 , iii . 168 ) , “ I have tried the rascals ( i. e . the public ) with my Harrys and Larrys , Pilgrims and Pirates . Nobody but S .... y has done any thing worth a slice of bookseller 's pudding , and he has not luck enough to be found out in doing a good thing , ” implies that Byron had read and admired Southey 's Roderick — an inference which is curiously confirmed by a memorandum in Murray 's handwriting : “ When Southey 's poem , Don Roderick ( sic ) , was published , Lord Byron sent in the middle of the night to ask John Murray if he had heard any opinion of it , for he thought it one of the finest poems he had ever read . ” The resemblance between the two passages , which is pointed out by Professor Kölbing , is too close to be wholly unconscious , but Byron 's expansion of Southey 's lines hardly amounts to a plagiarism . ]</p>
   <p>PARISINA .</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION TO PARISINA .</p>
   <p>Parisina , which had been begun before the Siege of Corinth , was transcribed by Lady Byron , and sent to the publisher at the beginning of December , 1815 . Murray confessed that he had been alarmed by some hints which Byron had dropped as to the plot of the narrative , but was reassured when he traced “ the delicate hand that transcribed it . ” He could not say enough of this “ Pearl ” of great price . “ It is very interesting , pathetic , beautiful — do you know I would almost say moral ” ( Memoir of John Murray , 1891 , i . 353 ) . Ward , to whom the MS. of Parisina was shown , and Isaac D'Israeli , who heard it read aloud by Murray , were enthusiastic as to its merits ; and Gifford , who had mingled censure with praise in his critical appreciation of the Siege , declared that the author “ had never surpassed Parisina . ”</p>
   <p>The last and shortest of the six narrative poems composed and published in the four years ( the first years of manhood and of fame , the only years of manhood passed at home in England ) which elapsed between the appearance of the first two cantos of Childe Harold and the third , Parisina has , perhaps , never yet received its due . At the time of its appearance it shared the odium which was provoked by the publication of Fare Thee Well and A Sketch , and before there was time to reconsider the new volume on its own merits , the new canto of Childe Harold , followed almost immediately by the Prisoner of Chillon and its brilliant and noticeable companion poems , usurped the attention of friend and foe . Contemporary critics ( with the exception of the Monthly and Critical Reviews ) fell foul of the subject-matter of the poem — the guilty passion of a bastard son for his father 's wife . “ It was too disgusting to be rendered pleasing by any display of genius ” ( European Magazine ) ; “ The story of Parisina includes adultery not to be named ” ( Literary Panorama ) ; while the Eclectic , on grounds of taste rather than of morals , gave judgment that “ the subject of the tale was purely unpleasing ” — “ the impression left simply painful . ”</p>
   <p>Byron , no doubt , for better or worse , was in advance of his age , in the pursuit of art for art 's sake , and in his indifference , not to morality — the dénouement of the story is severely moral — but to the moral edification of his readers . The tale was chosen because it is a tale of love and guilt and woe , and the poet , unconcerned with any other issue , sets the tale to an enchanting melody . It does not occur to him to condone or to reprobate the loves of Hugo and Parisina , and in detailing the issue leaves the actors to their fate . It was this aloofness from ethical considerations which perturbed and irritated the “ canters , ” as Byron called them — the children and champions of the anti-revolution . The modern reader , without being attracted or repelled by the motif of the story , will take pleasure in the sustained energy and sure beauty of the poetic strain . Byron may have gone to the “ nakedness of history ” for his facts , but he clothed them in singing robes of a delicate and shining texture .</p>

   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>The following poem is grounded on a circumstance mentioned in Gibbon 's “ Antiquities of the House of Brunswick . ” I am aware , that in modern times , the delicacy or fastidiousness of the reader may deem such subjects unfit for the purposes of poetry . The Greek dramatists , and some of the best of our old English writers , were of a different opinion : as Alfieri and Schiller have also been , more recently , upon the Continent . The following extract will explain the facts on which the story is founded . The name of Azo is substituted for Nicholas , as more metrical .— [ B . ]</p>
   <p>“ Under the reign of Nicholas III . [ A. D. 1425 ] Ferrara was polluted with a domestic tragedy . By the testimony of a maid , and his own observation , the Marquis of Este discovered the incestuous loves of his wife Parisina , and Hugo his bastard son , a beautiful and valiant youth . They were beheaded in the castle by the sentence of a father and husband , who published his shame , and survived their execution .<span type="note_anchor">[ 411 ]</span>He was unfortunate , if they were guilty : if they were innocent , he was still more unfortunate ; nor is there any possible situation in which I can sincerely approve the last act of the justice of a parent . ” — Gibbon 's Miscellaneous Works , vol . iii . p . 470 .— [ Ed . 1837 , p . 830 . ]</p>

   <note>411 ] { 503 } [ “ Ferrara is much decayed and depopulated ; but the castle still exists entire ; and I saw the court where Parisina and Hugo were beheaded , according to the annal of Gibbon . ” — Vide Advertisement to Lament of Tasso .</note>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 412 ]</span>{ 505 } “ This turned out a calamitous year for the people of Ferrara , for there occurred a very tragical event in the court of their sovereign . Our annals , both printed and in manuscript , with the exception of the unpolished and negligent work of Sardi , and one other , have given the following relation of it ,— from which , however , are rejected many details , and especially the narrative of Bandelli , who wrote a century afterwards , and who does not accord with the contemporary historians .</p>
   <p>“ By the above-mentioned Stella dell ’ Assassino , the Marquis , in the year 1405 , had a son called Ugo , a beautiful and ingenuous youth . Parisina Malatesta , second wife of Niccolo , like the generality of step-mothers , treated him with little kindness , to the infinite regret of the Marquis , who regarded him with fond partiality . One day she asked leave of her husband to undertake a certain journey , to which he consented , but upon condition that Ugo should bear her company ; for he hoped by these means to induce her , in the end , to lay aside the obstinate aversion which she had conceived against him . And indeed his intent was accomplished but too well , since , during the journey , she not only divested herself of all her hatred , but fell into the opposite extreme . After their return , the Marquis had no longer any occasion to renew his former reproofs . It happened one day that a servant of the Marquis , named Zoese , or , as some call him , Giorgio , passing before the apartments of Parisina , saw going out from them one of her chamber-maids , all terrified and in tears . Asking the reason , she told him that her mistress , for some slight offence , had been beating her ; and , giving vent to her rage , she added , that she could easily be revenged , if she chose to make known the criminal familiarity which subsisted between Parisina and her step-son . The servant took note of the words , and related them to his master . He was astounded thereat , but , scarcely believing his ears , he assured himself of the fact , alas ! too clearly , on the 18th of May , by looking through a hole made in the ceiling of his wife 's chamber . Instantly he broke into a furious rage , and arrested both of them , together with Aldobrandino Rangoni , of Modena , her gentleman , and also , as some say , two of the women of her chamber , as abettors of this sinful act . He ordered them to be brought to a hasty trial , desiring the judges to pronounce sentence , in the accustomed forms , upon the culprits . This sentence was death . Some there were that bestirred themselves in favour of the delinquents , and , amongst others , Ugoccion Contrario , who was all-powerful with Niccolo , and also his aged and much deserving minister Alberto dal Sale . Both of these , their tears flowing down their cheeks , and upon their knees , implored him for mercy ; adducing whatever reasons they could suggest for sparing the offenders , besides those motives of honour and decency which might persuade him to conceal from the public so scandalous a deed . But his rage made him inflexible , and , on the instant , he commanded that the sentence should be put in execution .</p>
   <p>“ It was , then , in the prisons of the castle , and exactly in those frightful dungeons which are seen at this day beneath the chamber called the Aurora , at the foot of the Lion 's tower , at the top of the street Giovecca , that on the night of the 21st of May were beheaded , first , Ugo , and afterwards Parisina . Zoese , he that accused her , conducted the latter under his arm to the place of punishment . She , all along , fancied that she was to be thrown into a pit , and asked at every step , whether she was yet come to the spot ? She was told that her punishment was the axe . She enquired what was become of Ugo , and received for answer , that he was already dead ; at which , sighing grievously , she exclaimed , ‘ Now , then , I wish not myself to live ; ’ and , being come to the block , she stripped herself , with her own hands , of all her ornaments , and , wrapping a cloth round her head , submitted to the fatal stroke , which terminated the cruel scene . The same was done with Rangoni , who , together with the others , according to two calendars in the library of St. Francesco , was buried in the cemetery of that convent . Nothing else is known respecting the women .</p>
   <p>“ The Marquis kept watch the whole of that dreadful night , and , as he was walking backwards and forwards , enquired of the captain of the castle if Ugo was dead yet ? who answered him , Yes . He then gave himself up to the most desperate lamentations , exclaiming , ‘ Oh ! that I too were dead , since I have been hurried on to resolve thus against my own Ugo ! ’ And then gnawing with his teeth a cane which he had in his hand , he passed the rest of the night in sighs and in tears , calling frequently upon his own dear Ugo . On the following day , calling to mind that it would be necessary to make public his justification , seeing that the transaction could not be kept secret , he ordered the narrative to be drawn out upon paper , and sent it to all the courts of Italy .</p>
   <p>“ On receiving this advice , the Doge of Venice , Francesco Foscari , gave orders , but without publishing his reasons , that stop should be put to the preparations for a tournament , which , under the auspices of the Marquis , and at the expense of the city of Padua , was about to take place , in the square of St. Mark , in order to celebrate his advancement to the ducal chair .</p>
   <p>“ The Marquis , in addition to what he had already done , from some unaccountable burst of vengeance , commanded that as many of the married women as were well known to him to be faithless , like his Parisina , should , like her , be beheaded . Amongst others , Barberina , or , as some call her , Laodamia Romei , wife of the court judge , underwent this sentence , at the usual place of execution ; that is to say , in the quarter of St. Giacomo , opposite the present fortress , beyond St. Paul 's . It cannot be told how strange appeared this proceeding in a prince , who , considering his own disposition , should , as it seemed , have been in such cases most indulgent . Some , however , there were who did not fail to commend him . ” [ Memorie per la Storia di Ferrara , Raccolte da Antonio Frizzi , 1793 , iii . 408-410 .

   <p>Putting Lady Macbeth out of the question , the situation may be traced to a passage in Henry Mackenzie 's Julia de Roubigné ( 1777 , ii . 101 : “ Montauban to Segarva , ” Letter xxxv . ):—</p>
   <p>“ I was last night abroad at supper ; Julia was a-bed before my return . I found her lute lying on the table , and a music-book open by it . I could perceive the marks of tears shed on the paper , and the air was such as might encourage their falling . Sleep , however , had overcome her sadness , and she did not awake when I opened the curtain to look on her . When I had stood some moments , I heard her sigh strongly through her sleep , and presently she muttered some words , I know not of what import . I had sometimes heard her do so before , without regarding it much ; but there was something that roused my attention now . I listened ; she sighed again , and again spoke a few broken words . At last I heard her plainly pronounce the name Savillon two or three times , and each time it was accompanied with sighs so deep that her heart seemed bursting as it heaved then . ” ]</p>

   <p>POEMS OF THE SEPARATION .</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION TO POEMS OF THE SEPARATION .</p>
   <p>The two poems , Fare Thee Well ( March 17 ) and A Sketch ( March 29 , 1816 ) , which have hitherto been entitled Domestic Pieces , or Poems on His Own Circumstances , I have ventured to rename Poems of the Separation . Of secondary importance as poems or works of art , they stand out by themselves as marking and helping to make the critical epoch in the life and reputation of the poet . It is to be observed that there was an interval of twelve days between the date of Fare Thee Well and A Sketch ; that the composition of the latter belongs to a later episode in the separation drama ; and that for some reasons connected with the proceedings between the parties , a pathetic if not uncritical resignation had given place to the extremity of exasperation — to hatred and fury and revenge . It follows that either poem , in respect of composition and of publication , must be judged on its own merits . Contemporary critics , while they were all but unanimous in holding up A Sketch to unqualified reprobation , were divided with regard to the good taste and good faith of Fare Thee Well . Moore intimates that at first , and , indeed , for some years after the separation , he was strongly inclined to condemn the Fare Thee Well as a histrionic performance — “ a showy effusion of sentiment ; ” but that on reading the account of all the circumstances in Byron 's Memoranda , he was impressed by the reality of the “ swell of tender recollections , under the influence of which , as he sat one night musing in his study , these stanzas were produced — the tears , as he said , falling fast over the paper as he wrote them ” ( Life , p. 302 ) .</p>
   <p>With whatever purpose , or under whatever emotion the lines were written , Byron did not keep them to himself . They were shown to Murray , and copies were sent to “ the initiated . ” “ I have just received , ” writes Murray , “ the enclosed letter from Mrs. Maria Graham [ 1785-1842 , née Dundas , authoress and traveller , afterwards Lady Callcott ] , to whom I had sent the verses . It will show you that you are thought of in the remotest corners , and furnishes me with an excuse for repeating that I shall not forget you . God bless your Lordship . Fare Thee Well ” [ MSS . M .] .</p>
   <p>But it does not appear that they were printed in their final shape ( the proof of a first draft , consisting of thirteen stanzas , is dated March 18 , 1816 ) till the second copy of verses were set up in type with a view to private distribution ( see Letters , 1899 , iii . 279 ) . Even then there was no thought of publication on the part of Byron or of Murray , and , as a matter of fact , though Fare Thee Well was included in the “ Poems ” of 1816 , it was not till both poems had appeared in over twenty pirated editions that A Sketch was allowed to appear in vol . iii . of the Collected Works of 1819 . Unquestionably Byron intended that the “ initiated , ” whether foes or sympathizers , should know that he had not taken his dismissal in silence ; but it is far from certain that he connived at the appearance of either copy of verses in the public press . It is impossible to acquit him of the charge of appealing to a limited circle of specially chosen witnesses and advocates in a matter which lay between himself and his wife , but the aggravated offence of rushing into print may well be attributed to “ the injudicious zeal of a friend , ” or the “ malice prepense ” of an enemy . If he had hoped that the verses would slip into a newspaper , as it were , malgré lui , he would surely have taken care that the seed fell on good ground under the favouring influence of Perry of the Morning Chronicle , or Leigh Hunt of the Examiner . As it turned out , the first paper which possessed or ventured to publish a copy of the “ domestic pieces ” was the Champion , a Tory paper , then under the editorship of John Scott ( 1783-1821 ) , a man of talent and of probity , but , as Mr. Lang puts it ( Life and Letters of John Gibson Lockhart , 1897 , i . 256 ) , “ Scotch , and a professed moralist . ” The date of publication was Sunday , April 14 , and it is to be noted that the Ode from the French ( “ We do not curse thee , Waterloo ” ) had been published in the Morning Chronicle on March 15 , and that on the preceding Sunday , April 7 , the brilliant but unpatriotic apostrophe to the Star of the Legion of Honour had appeared in the Examiner . “ We notice it [ this strain of his Lordship 's harp ] , ” writes the editor , “ because we think it would not be doing justice to the merits of such political tenets , if they were not coupled with their corresponding practice in regard to moral and domestic obligations . There is generally a due proportion kept in ‘ the music of men 's lives . ’ ... Of many of the facts of this distressing case we are not ignorant ; but God knows they are not for a newspaper . Fortunately they fall within very general knowledge , in London at least ; if they had not they would never have found their way to us . But there is a respect due to certain wrongs and sufferings that would be outraged by uncovering them . ” It was all very mysterious , very terrible ; but what wonder that the laureate of the ex-emperor , the contemner of the Bourbons , the pæanist of the “ star of the brave , ” “ the rainbow of the free , ” should make good his political heresy by personal depravity — by unmanly vice , unmanly whining , unmanly vituperation ?</p>
   <p>Wordsworth , to whom Scott forwarded the Champion of April 14 , “ outdid ” the journalist in virtuous fury : “ Let me say only one word of Lord B . The man is insane . The verses on his private affairs excite in me less indignation than pity . The latter copy is the Billingsgate of Bedlam . ... You yourself seem to labour under some delusion as to the merits of Lord B . ' s poetry , and treat the wretched verses , the Fare Well , with far too much respect . They are disgusting in sentiment , and in execution contemptible . ‘ Though my many faults deface me , ’ etc . Can worse doggerel than such a stanza be written ? One verse is commendable : ‘ All my madness none can know . ’ ” The criticism , as criticism , confutes itself , and is worth quoting solely because it displays the feeling of a sane and honourable man towards a member of the “ opposition , ” who had tripped and fallen , and now lay within reach of his lash ( see Life of William Wordsworth , 1889 , ii . 267 , etc . ) .</p>
   <p>It was not only , as Macaulay put it , that Byron was “ singled out as an expiatory sacrifice ” by the British public in a periodical fit of morality , but , as the extent and the limitations of the attack reveal , occasion was taken by political adversaries to inflict punishment for an outrage on popular sentiment .</p>
   <p>The Champion had been the first to give tongue , and the other journals , on the plea that the mischief was out , one after the other took up the cry . On Monday , April 15 , the Sun printed Fare Thee Well , and on Tuesday , April 16 , followed with A Sketch . On the same day the Morning Chronicle , protesting that “ the poems were not written for the public eye , but as having been inserted in a Sunday paper , ” printed both sets of verses ; the Morning Post , with an ugly hint that “ the noble Lord gives us verses , when he dare not give us circumstances , ” restricted itself to Fare Thee Well ; while the Times , in a leading paragraph , feigned to regard “ the two extraordinary copies of verses ... the whining stanzas of Fare Thee Well , and the low malignity and miserable doggerel of the companion Sketch , ” as “ an injurious fabrication . ” On Thursday , the 18th , the Courier , though declining to insert A Sketch , deals temperately and sympathetically with the Fare Thee Well , and quotes the testimony of a “ fair correspondent ” (? Madame de Staël ) , that if “ her husband had bade her such a farewell she could not have avoided running into his arms , and being reconciled immediately — ‘ Je n'aurois pu m'y tenir un instant ’ ; ” and on the same day the Times , having learnt to its “ extreme astonishment and regret , ” that both poems were indeed Lord Byron 's , maintained that the noble author had “ degraded literature , and abused the privileges of rank , by converting them into weapons of vengeance against an inferior and a female . ” On Friday , the 19th , the Star printed both poems , and the Morning Post inserted a criticism , which had already appeared in the Courier of the preceding day . On Saturday , the 20th , the Courier found itself compelled , in the interests of its readers , to print both poems . On Sunday , the 21st , the octave of the original issue , the Examiner devoted a long article to an apology for Byron , and a fierce rejoinder to the Champion ; and on the same day the Independent Whig and the Sunday News , which favoured the “ opposition , ” printed both poems , with prefatory notices more or less favourable to the writer ; whereas the Tory Antigallican Monitor , which also printed both poems , added the significant remark that “ if everything said of Lord Byron be true , it would appear that the Whigs were not altogether so immaculate as they themselves would wish the world to suppose . ”</p>
   <p>The testimony of the press is instructive from two points of view . In the first place , it tends to show that the controversy was conducted on party lines ; and , secondly , that the editor of the Champion was in some degree responsible for the wide diffusion and lasting publicity of the scandal . The separation of Lord and Lady Byron must , in any case , have been more than a nine days ’ wonder , but if the circulation of the “ pamphlet ” had been strictly confined to the “ initiated , ” the excitement and interest of the general public would have smouldered and died out for lack of material .</p>
   <p>In his second letter on Bowles , dated March 25 , 1821 ( Observations upon Observations , Life , 1892 , p. 705 ) , Byron alludes to the publication of these poems in the Champion , and comments on the behaviour of the editor , who had recently ( February 16 , 1821 ) been killed in a duel . He does not minimize the wrong , but he pays a fine and generous tribute to the courage and worth of his assailant . “ Poor Scott is now no more ... he died like a brave man , and he lived an able one , ” etc . It may be added that Byron was an anonymous subscriber to a fund raised by Sir James Mackintosh , Murray , and others , for “ the helpless family of a man of virtue and ability ” ( London Magazine , April , 1821 , vol . iii . p. 359 ) .</p>
   <p>For chronological reasons , and in accordance with the precedent of the edition of 1832 , a third poem , Stanzas to Augusta , has been included in this group .</p>

     <l n="1">When all around grew drear and dark , [ sn ]</l>
     <l n="2">And reason half withheld her ray —</l>
     <l n="3">And Hope but shed a dying spark</l>
     <l n="4">Which more misled my lonely way ;</l>
     <l n="5">In that deep midnight of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="6">And that internal strife of heart ,</l>
     <l n="7">When dreading to be deemed too kind ,</l>
     <l n="8">The weak despair — the cold depart ;</l>
     <l n="9">When Fortune changed — and Love fled far , [ so ]</l>
     <l n="10">And Hatred 's shafts flew thick and fast ,</l>
     <l n="11">Thou wert the solitary star [ sp ]</l>
     <l n="12">Which rose and set not to the last . [ sq ]</l>
     <l n="13">Oh ! blest be thine unbroken light !</l>
     <l n="14">That watched me as a Seraph 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="15">And stood between me and the night ,</l>
     <l n="16">For ever shining sweetly nigh .</l>
     <l n="17">And when the cloud upon us came , [ sr ]</l>
     <l n="18">Which strove to blacken o'er thy ray — [ ss ]</l>
     <l n="19">Then purer spread its gentle flame , [ st ]</l>
     <l n="20">And dashed the darkness all away .</l>
     <l n="21">Still may thy Spirit dwell on mine , [ su ]</l>
     <l n="22">And teach it what to brave or brook —</l>
     <l n="23">There 's more in one soft word of thine</l>
     <l n="24">Than in the world 's defied rebuke .</l>
     <l n="25">Thou stood'st , as stands a lovely tree , [ sv ]</l>
     <l n="26">That still unbroke , though gently bent ,</l>
     <l n="27">Still waves with fond fidelity</l>
     <l n="28">Its boughs above a monument .</l>
     <l n="29">The winds might rend — the skies might pour ,</l>
     <l n="30">But there thou wert — and still wouldst be</l>
     <l n="31">Devoted in the stormiest hour</l>
     <l n="32">To shed thy weeping leaves o'er me .</l>
     <l n="33">But thou and thine shall know no blight ,</l>
     <l n="34">Whatever fate on me may fall ;</l>
     <l n="35">For Heaven in sunshine will requite</l>
     <l n="36">The kind — and thee the most of all .</l>
     <l n="37">Then let the ties of baffled love</l>
     <l n="38">Be broken — thine will never break ;</l>
     <l n="39">Thy heart can feel — but will not move ;</l>
     <l n="40">Thy soul , though soft , will never shake .</l>
     <l n="41">And these , when all was lost beside ,</l>
     <l n="42">Were found and still are fixed in thee :—</l>
     <l n="43">And bearing still a breast so tried ,</l>
     <l n="44">Earth is no desert — ev'n to me .</l>
