    <docTitle><titlePart>Inebriety and The Candidate by George Crabbe Contents : Inebriety The Candidate An Introductory Address To the Reader To the Authors of the Monthly Review “ INEBRIETY ” { 1 } The mighty spirit , and its power , which stains The bloodless cheek , and vivifies the brains , I sing . Say , ye , its fiery vot'ries true , The jovial curate , and the shrill-tongued shrew ; Ye , in the floods of limpid poison nurst , Where bowl the second charms like bowl the first ; Say how , and why , the sparkling ill is shed , The heart which hardens , and which rules the head . When winter stern his gloomy front uprears , A sable void the barren earth appears ; The meads no more their former verdure boast , Fast bound their streams , and all their beauty lost ; The herds , the flocks , in icy garments mourn , And wildly murmur for the spring 's return ; From snow-topp 'd hills the whirlwinds keenly blow , Howl through the woods , and pierce the vales below ; Through the sharp air a flaky torrent flies , Mocks the slow sight , and hides the gloomy skies ; The fleecy clouds their chilly bosoms bare , And shed their substance on the floating air ; The floating air their downy substance glides Through springing waters , and prevents their tides ; Seizes the rolling waves , and , as a god , Charms their swift race , and stops the refluent flood ; The opening valves , which fill the venal road , Then scarcely urge along the sanguine flood ; The labouring pulse a slower motion rules , The tendons stiffen , and the spirit cools ; Each asks the aid of Nature 's sister , Art , To cheer the senses , and to warm the heart . The gentle fair on nervous tea relies , Whilst gay good-nature sparkles in her eyes ; An inoffensive scandal fluttering round , Too rough to tickle , and too light to wound ; Champagne the courtier drinks , the spleen to chase , The colonel burgundy , and port his grace ; Turtle and ‘ rrac the city rulers charm , Ale and content the labouring peasants warm : O'er the dull embers , happy Colin sits , Colin , the prince of joke , and rural wits ; Whilst the wind whistles through the hollow panes , He drinks , nor of the rude assault complains ; And tells the tale , from sire to son retold , Of spirits vanishing near hidden gold ; Of moon-clad imps that tremble by the dew , Who skim the air , or glide o'er waters blue : The throng invisible that , doubtless , float By mouldering tombs , and o'er the stagnant meat : Fays dimly glancing on the russet plain , And all the dreadful nothing of the green . Peace be to such , the happiest and the best , Who with the forms of fancy urge their jest ; Who wage no war with an avenger 's rod , Nor in the pride of reason curse their God . When in the vaulted arch Lucina gleams , And gaily dances o'er the azure streams ; On silent ether when a trembling sound Reverberates , and wildly floats around , Breaking through trackless space upon the ear , Conclude the Bacchanalian rustic near : O'er hills and vales the jovial savage reels , Fire in his head and frenzy at his heels ; From paths direct the bending hero swerves , And shapes his way in ill-proportioned curves . Now safe arrived , his sleeping rib he calls , And madly thunders on the muddy walls ; The well-known sounds an equal fury move , For rage meets rage , as love enkindles love : In vain the waken 'd infant 's accents shrill , The humble regions of the cottage fill ; In vain the cricket chirps the mansion through , ‘ Tis war , and blood , and battle must ensue . As when , on humble stage , him Satan hight Defies the brazen hero to the fight : From twanging strokes what dire misfortunes rise , What fate to maple arms and glassen eyes ! Here lies a leg of elm , and there a stroke From ashen neck has whirl 'd a head of oak . So drops from either power , with vengeance big , A remnant night-cap and an old cut wig ; Titles unmusical retorted round , On either ear with leaden vengeance sound ; Till equal valour , equal wounds create , And drowsy peace concludes the fell debate ; Sleep in her woollen mantle wraps the pair , And sheds her poppies on the ambient air ; Intoxication flies , as fury fled , On rooky pinions quits the aching head ; Returning reason cools the fiery blood , And drives from memory 's seat the rosy god . Yet still he holds o'er some his maddening rule . Still sways his sceptre , and still knows his fool ; Witness the livid lip , and fiery front , With many a smarting trophy placed upo n't ; The hollow eye , which plays in misty springs , And the hoarse voice , which rough and broken rings ; These are his triumphs , and o'er these he reigns , The blinking deity of reeling brains . See Inebriety ! her wand she waves , And lo ! her pale , and lo ! her purple slaves ! Sots in embroidery , and sots in crape , Of every order , station , rank , and shape : The king , who nods upon his rattle throne ; The staggering peer , to midnight revel prone ; The slow-tongued bishop , and the deacon sly , The humble pensioner , and gownsman dry ; The proud , the mean , the selfish , and the great , Swell the dull throng , and stagger into state . Lo ! proud Flaminius at the splendid board , The easy chaplain of an atheist lord , Quaffs the bright juice , with all the gust of sense , And clouds his brain in torpid elegance ; In china vases , see ! the sparkling ill , From gay decanters view the rosy rill ; The neat-carved pipes in silver settle laid , The screw by mathematic cunning made : Oh , happy priest ! whose God , like Egypt 's , lies At once the deity and sacrifice . But is Flaminius then the man alone To whom the joys of swimming brains are known ? Lo ! the poor toper whose untutor 'd sense , Sees bliss in ale , and can with wine dispense ; Whose head proud fancy never taught to steer Beyond the muddy ecstasies of beer ; But simple nature can her longing quench , Behind the settle 's curve , or humbler bench : Some kitchen fire diffusing warmth around , The semi-globe by hieroglyphics crown 'd ; Where canvas purse displays the brass enroll 'd , Nor waiters rave , nor landlords thirst for gold ; Ale and content his fancy 's bounds confine . He asks no limpid punch , no rosy wine ; But sees , admitted to an equal share , Each faithful swain the heady potion bear : Go , wiser thou ! and in thy scale of taste , Weigh gout and gravel against ale and rest ; Call vulgar palates what thou judgest so ; Say beer is heavy , windy , cold , and slow ; Laugh at poor sots with insolent pretence , Yet cry , when tortured , where is Providence ? In various forms the madd'ning spirit moves , This drinks and fights , another drinks and loves . A bastard zeal , of different kinds it shows , And now with rage , and now religion glows : The frantic soul bright reason 's path defies , Now creeps on earth , now triumphs in the skies ; Swims in the seas of error , and explores , Through midnight mists , the fluctuating shores ; From wave to wave in rocky channel glides , And sinks in woe , or on presumption slides ; In pride exalted , or by shame deprest , An angel-devil , or a human-beast . Some rage in all the strength of folly mad ; Some love stupidity , in silence clad , Are never quarrelsome , are never gay , But sleep , and groan , and drink the night away ; Old Torpio nods , and as the laugh goes round , Grunts through the nasal duct , and joins the sound . Then sleeps again , and , as the liquors pass , Wakes at the friendly jog , and takes his glass : Alike to him who stands , or reels , or moves , The elbow chair , good wine , and sleep he loves , Nor cares of state disturb his easy head , By grosser fumes and calmer follies fed ; Nor thoughts of when , or where , or how to come , The canvass general , or the general doom ; Extremes ne'er reach 'd one passion of his soul , A villain tame , and an unmettled fool ; To half his vices he has but pretence , For they usurp the place of common sense ; To half his little merits has no claim , For very indolence has raised his name ; Happy in this , that , under Satan 's sway , His passions tremble , but will not obey . The vicar at the table 's front presides , Whose presence a monastic life derides ; The reverend wig , in sideway order placed , The reverend band , by rubric stains disgraced , The leering eye , in wayward circles roll 'd , Mark him the pastor of a joyial fold , Whose various texts excite a loud applause , Favouring the bottle , and the good old cause . See ! the dull smile which fearfully appears , When gross indecency her front uprears , The joy conceal 'd , the fiercer burns within , As masks afford the keenest gust to sin ; Imagination helps the reverend sire , And spreads the sails of sub-divine desire ; But when the gay immoral joke goes round , When shame and all her blushing train are drown 'd , Rather than hear his God blasphemed , he takes The last loved glass , and then the board forsakes . Not that religion prompts the sober thought , But slavish custom has the practice taught ; Besides , this zealous son of warm devotion Has a true Levite bias for promotion . Vicars must with discretion go astray , Whilst bishops may be damn 'd the nearest way ; So puny robbers individuals kill , When hector-heroes murder as they will . Good honest Curio elbows the divine , And strives a social sinner how to shine ; The dull quaint tale is his , the lengthen 'd tale , That Wilton farmers give you with their ale , How midnight ghosts o'er vaults terrific pass , Dance o'er the grave , and slide along the grass ; Or how pale Cicely within the wood Call 'd Satan forth , and bargain 'd with her blood . These , honest Curio , are thine , and these Are the dull treasures of a brain at peace ; No wit intoxicates thy gentle skull , Of heavy , native , unwrought folly full : Bowl upon bowl in vain exert their force , The breathing spirit takes a downward course , Or mainly soaring upwards to the head , Meets an impenetrable fence of lead . Hast thou , oh reader ! searched o'er gentle Gay , Where various animals their powers display ? In one strange group a chattering race are hurl 'd , Led by the monkey who had seen the world . Like him Fabricio steals from guardian 's side , Swims not in pleasure 's stream , but sips the tide : He hates the bottle , yet but thinks it right To boast next day the honours of the night ; None like your coward can describe a fight . See him as down the sparkling potion goes , Labour to grin away the horrid dose ; In joy-feigned gaze his misty eyeballs float , Th ’ uncivil spirit gurgling at his throat ; So looks dim Titan through a wintry scene , And faintly cheers the woe-foreboding swain . Timon , long practised in the school of art , Has lost each finer feeling of the heart ; Triumphs o'er shame , and , with delusive wiles , Laughs at the idiot he himself beguiles : So matrons , past the awe of censure 's tongue , Deride the blushes of the fair and young . Few with more fire on every subject spoke , But chief he loved the gay immoral joke ; The words most sacred , stole from holy writ , He gave a newer form , and called them wit . Vice never had a more sincere ally , So bold no sinner , yet no saint so sly ; Learn 'd , but not wise , and without virtue brave , A gay , deluding , philosophic knave . When Bacchus ’ joys his airy fancy fire , They stir a new , but still a false desire ; And to the comfort of each untaught fool , Horace in English vindicates the bowl . “ The man , ” says Timon , “ who is drunk is blest , No fears disturb , no cares destroy his rest ; In thoughtless joy he reels away his life , Nor dreads that worst of ills , a noisy wife . ” “ Oh ! place me , Jove , where none but women come , And thunders worse than thine afflict the room , Where one eternal nothing flutters round , And senseless titt'ring sense of mirth confound ; Or lead me bound to garret , Babel-high , Where frantic poet rolls his crazy eye , Tiring the ear with oft-repeated chimes , And smiling at the never-ending rhymes : E'en here , or there , I 'll be as blest as Jove , Give me tobacco , and the wine I love . ” Applause from hands the dying accents break , Of stagg'ring sots who vainly try to speak ; From Milo , him who hangs upon each word , And in loud praises splits the tortured board , Collects each sentence , ere it 's better known , And makes the mutilated joke his own . At weekly club to flourish , where he rules , The glorious president of grosser fools . But cease , my Muse ! of those or these enough , The fools who listen , and the knaves who scoff ; The jest profane , that mocks th ’ offended God , Defies his power , and sets at nought his rod ; The empty laugh , discretion 's vainest foe , From fool to fool re-echoed to and fro ; The sly indecency , that slowly springs From barren wit , and halts on trembling wings : Enough of these , and all the charms of wine , Be sober joys and social evenings mine ; Where peace and reason , unsoil 'd mirth , improve The powers of friendship and the joys of love ; Where thought meets thought ere words its form array , And all is sacred , elegant , and gay : Such pleasure leaves no sorrow on the mind , Too great to fall , to sicken too refined ; Too soft for noise , and too sublime for art , The social solace of the feeling heart , For sloth too rapid , and for wit too high , ‘ Tis virtue 's pleasure , and can never die ! “ THE CANDIDATE ” { 2 } A POETICAL EPISTLE TO THE AUTHORS OF THE MONTHLY REVIEW . AN INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS OF THE AUTHOR TO HIS POEMS .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <docImprint>Ye idler things , that soothed my hours of care , Where would ye wander , triflers , tell me where ? As maids neglected , do ye fondly dote , On the tair type , or the embroider 'd coat ; Detest my modest shelf , and long to fly Where princely Popes and mighty Miltons lie ? Taught but to sing , and that in simple style , Of Lycia 's lip , and Musidora 's smile ; -  Go then ! and taste a yet unfelt distress , The fear that guards the captivating press ; Whose maddening region should ye once explore , No refuge yields my tongueless mansion more . But thus ye 'll grieve , Ambition 's plumage stript , “ Ah , would to Heaven , we 'd died in manuscript ! ” Your unsoil 'd page each yawning wit shall flee , -  For few will read , and none admire like me . - Its place , where spiders silent bards enrobe , Squeezed betwixt Cibber 's Odes and Blackmore 's Job ; Where froth and mud , that varnish and deform , Feed the lean critic and the fattening worm ; Then sent disgraced — the unpaid printer 's bane -  To mad Moorfields , or sober Chancery Lane , On dirty stalls I see your hopes expire , Vex 'd by the grin of your unheeded sire , Who half reluctant has his care resign 'd , Like a teased parent , and is rashly kind . Yet rush not all , but let some scout go forth , View the strange land , and tell us of its worth ; And should he there barbarian usage meet , The patriot scrap shall warn us to retreat . And thou , the first of thy eccentric race , A forward imp , go , search the dangerous place , Where Fame 's eternal blossoms tempt each bard , Though dragon-wits there keep eternal guard ; Hope not unhurt the golden spoil to seize , The Muses yield , as the Hesperides ; Who bribes the guardian , all his labour 's done , For every maid is willing to be won . Before the lords of verse a suppliant stand , And beg our passage through the fairy land : Beg more — to search for sweets each blooming field , And crop the blossoms woods and valleys yield , To snatch the tints that beam on Fancy 's bow ; And feel the fires on Genius ’ wings that glow ; Praise without meanness , without flattery stoop , Soothe without fear , and without trembling , hope .</docImprint>

    <p n="1">The following Poem being itself of an introductory nature , its author supposes it can require but little preface .</p>
    <p n="2">It is published with a view of obtaining the opinion of the candid and judicious reader on the merits of the writer as a poet ; very few , he apprehends , being in such cases sufficiently impartial to decide for themselves .</p>
    <p n="3">It is addressed to the Authors of the Monthy Review , as to critics of acknowledged merit ; an acquaintance with whose labours has afforded the writer of this Epistle a reason for directing it to them in particular , and , he presumes , will yield to others a just and sufficient plea for the preference .</p>
    <p n="4">Familiar with disappointment , he shall not be much surprised to find he has mistaken his talent .</p>
    <p n="5">However , if not egregiously the dupe of his vanity , he promises to his readers some entertainment , and is assured that however little in the ensuing Poem is worthy of applause , there is yet less that merits contempt .</p>

    <docImprint>The pious pilot , whom the gods provide , Through the rough seas the shatter 'd bark to guide , Trusts not alone his knowledge of the deep , Its rocks that threaten , and its sands that sleep ; But whilst with nicest skill he steers his way , The guardian Tritons hear their favourite pray . Hence borne his vows to Neptune 's coral dome , The god relents , and shuts each gulfy tomb . Thus as on fatal floods to fame I steer , I dread the storm that ever rattles here , Nor think enough , that long my yielding soul Has felt the Muse 's soft but strong control , Nor think enough , that manly strength and ease , Such as have pleased a friend , will strangers please ; But , suppliant , to the critic 's throne I bow , Here burn my incense , and here pay my vow ; That censure hush 'd , may every blast give o'er , And the lash 'd coxcomb hiss contempt no more . And ye , whom authors dread or dare in vain , Affecting modest hopes , or poor disdain , Receive a bard , who neither mad nor mean , Despises each extreme , and sails between ; Who fears ; but has , amid his fears confess 'd , The conscious virtue of a Muse oppress 'd ; A muse in changing times and stations nursed , By nature honour 'd , and by fortune cursed . No servile strain of abject hope she brings , Nor soars presumptuous , with unwearied wings , But , pruned for flight — the future all her care -  Would know her strength , and , if not strong , forbear . The supple slave to regal pomp bows down , Prostrate to power , and cringing to a crown ; The bolder villain spurns a decent awe , Tramples on rule , and breaks through every law ; But he whose soul on honest truth relies , Nor meanly flatters power , nor madly flies . Thus timid authors bear an abject mind , And plead for mercy they but seldom find . Some , as the desperate , to the halter run , Boldly deride the fate they cannot shun ; But such there are , whose minds , not taught to stoop , Yet hope for fame , and dare avow their hope , Who neither brave the judges of their cause , Nor beg in soothing strains a brief applause . And such I 'd be ;— and ere my fate is past , Ere clear 'd with honour , or with culprits cast , Humbly at Learning 's bar I 'll state my case , And welcome then distinction or disgrace ! When in the man the flights of fancy reign , Rule in the heart or revel in the brain , As busy Thought her wild creation apes , And hangs delighted o'er her varying shapes , It asks a judgment , weighty and discreet , To know where wisdom prompts , and where conceit . Alike their draughts to every scribbler 's mind ( Blind to their faults as to their danger blind ) ; -  We write enraptured , and we write in haste , Dream idle dreams , and call them things of taste , Improvement trace in every paltry line , And see , transported , every dull design ; Are seldom cautious , all advice detest , And ever think our own opinions best ; Nor shows my Muse a muse-like spirit here , Who bids me pause , before I persevere . But she — who shrinks while meditating flight In the wide way , whose bounds delude her sight , Yet tired in her own mazes still to roam , And cull poor banquets for the soul at home , Would , ere she ventures , ponder on the way , Lest dangers yet unthought of , flight betray ; Lest her Icarian wing , by wits unplumed , Be robb 'd of all the honours she assumed ; And Dulness swell ,— a black and dismal sea , Gaping her grave ; while censures madden me . Such was his fate , who flew too near the sun , Shot far beyond his strength , and was undone ; Such is his fate , who creeping at the shore The billow sweeps him , and he 's found no more . Oh ! for some god , to bear my fortunes fair Midway betwixt presumption and despair ! “ Has then some friendly critic 's former blow Taught thee a prudence authors seldom know ? ” Not so ! their anger and their love untried , A woe-taught prudence deigns to tend my side : Life 's hopes ill-sped , the Muse 's hopes grow poor , And though they flatter , yet they charm no more ; Experience points where lurking dangers lay , And as I run , throws caution in my way . There was a night , when wintry winds did rage , Hard by a ruin 'd pile , I meet a sage ; Resembling him the time-struck place appear 'd , Hollow its voice , and moss its spreading beard ; Whose fate-lopp 'd brow , the bat 's and beetle 's dome , Shook , as the hunted owl flew hooting home . His breast was bronzed by many an eastern blast , And fourscore winters seem 'd he to have past ; His thread-bare coat the supple osier bound , And with slow feet he press 'd the sodden ground , Where , as he heard the wild-wing 'd Eurus blow , He shook , from locks as white , December 's snow ; Inured to storm , his soul ne'er bid it cease , But lock 'd within him meditated peace . Father , I said — for silver hairs inspire , And oft I call the bending peasant Sire -  Tell me , as here beneath this ivy bower , That works fantastic round its trembling tower , We hear Heaven 's guilt-alarming thunders roar , Tell me the pains and pleasures of the poor ; For Hope , just spent , requires a sad adieu , And Fear acquaints me I shall live with you . There was a time when , by Delusion led , A scene of sacred bliss around me spread , On Hope 's , as Pisgah 's lofty top , I stood , And saw my Canaan there , my promised good ; A thousand scenes of joy the clime bestow 'd , And wine and oil through vision 's valleys flow 'd ; As Moses his , I call 'd my prospect bless 'd , And gazed upon the good I ne'er possess 'd : On this side Jordan doom 'd by fate to stand , Whilst happier Joshuas win the promised land . “ Son , ” said the Sage — “ be this thy care suppress 'd ; The state the gods shall chose thee is the best : Rich if thou art , they ask thy praises more , And would thy patience when they make thee poor ; But other thoughts within thy bosom reign , And other subjects vex thy busy brain , Poetic wreaths thy vainer dreams excite , And thy sad stars have destined thee to write . Then since that task the ruthless fates decree , Take a few precepts from the gods and me ! “ Be not too eager in the arduous chase ; Who pants for triumph seldom wins the race : Venture not all , but wisely hoard thy worth , And let thy labours one by one go forth : Some happier scrap capricious wits may find On a fair day , and be profusely kind ; Which , buried in the rubbish of a throng , Had pleased as little as a new-year 's song , Or lover 's verse , that cloy 'd with nauseous sweet , Or birth-day ode , that ran on ill-pair 'd feet . Merit not always — Fortune feeds the bard , And as the whim inclines bestows reward : None without wit , nor with it numbers gain ; To please is hard , but none shall please in vain : As a coy mistress is the humour 'd town , Loth every lover with success to crown ; He who would win must every effort try , Sail in the mode , and to the fashion fly ; Must gay or grave to every humour dress , And watch the lucky Moment of Success ; That caught , no more his eager hopes are crost ; But vain are Wit and Love , when that is lost . ” Thus said the god ; for now a god he grew His white locks changing to a golden hue , And from his shoulders hung a mantle azure-blue . His softening eyes the winning charm disclosed Of dove-like Delia when her doubts reposed ; Mira 's alone a softer lustre bear , When woe beguiles them of an angel 's tear ; Beauteous and young the smiling phantom stood , Then sought on airy wing his blest abode . Ah ! truth , distasteful in poetic theme , Why is the Muse compell 'd to own her dream ? Whilst forward wits had sworn to every line , I only wish to make its moral mine . Say then , O ye who tell how authors speed , May Hope indulge her flight , and I succeed ? Say , shall my name , to future song prefixed , Be with the meanest of the tuneful mix 'd ? Shall my soft strains the modest maid engage , My graver numbers move the silver “ d sage , My tender themes delight the lover 's heart , And comfort to the poor my solemn songs impart ? For Oh ! thou Hope 's , thou Thought 's eternal King , Who gav'st them power to charm , and me to sing -  Chief to thy praise my willing numbers soar , And in my happier transports I adore ; Mercy ! thy softest attribute proclaim , Thyself in abstract , thy more lovely name ; That flings o'er all my grief a cheering ray , As the full moon-beam gilds the watery way . And then too , Love , my soul 's resistless lord , Shall many a gentle , generous strain afford , To all the soil of sooty passion blind , Pure as embracing angels and as kind ; Our Mira 's name in future times shall shine , And — though the harshest — Shepherds envy mine . Then let me ( pleasing task ! ) however hard , Join , as of old , the prophet and the bard ; If not , ah ! shield me from the dire disgrace , That haunts our wild and visionary race ; Let me not draw my lengthen 'd lines along , And tire in untamed infamy of song , Lest , in some dismal Dunciad 's future page , I stand the CIBBER of this tuneless age ; Lest , in another POPE th ’ indulgent skies Should give inspired by all their deities , My luckless name , in his immortal strain , Should , blasted , brand me as a second Cain ; Doom 'd in that song to live against my will , Whom all must scorn , and yet whom none could kill . The youth , resisted by the maiden 's art , Persists , and time subdues her kindling heart ; To strong entreaty yields the widow 's vow , As mighty walls to bold beseigers bow ; Repeated prayers draw bounty from the sky , And heaven is won by importunity ; Ours , a projecting tribe , pursue in vain , In tedious trials , an uncertain gain ; Madly plunge on through every hope 's defeat , And with our ruin only find the cheat . “ And why then seek that luckless doom to share ? ” Who , I ?— To shun it is my only care . I grant it true , that others better tell Of mighty WOLFE , who conquer 'd as he fell ; Of heroes born , their threaten 'd realms to save , Whom Fame anoints , and Envy tends whose grave ; Of crimson 'd fields , where Fate , in dire array , Gives to the breathless the short-breathing clay ; Ours , a young train , by humbler fountains dream , Nor taste presumptuous the Pierian stream ; When Rodney 's triumph comes on eagle-wing , We hail the victor whom we fear to sing ; Nor tell we how each hostile chief goes on , The luckless Lee , or wary Washington ; How Spanish bombast blusters — they were beat , And French politeness dulcifies — defeat . My modest Muse forbears to speak of kings , Lest fainting stanzas blast the name she sings ; For who — the tenant of the beechen shade , Dares the big thought in regal breasts pervade ? Or search his soul , whom each too-favouring god Gives to delight in plunder , pomp , and blood ? No ; let me free from Cupid 's frolic round , Rejoice , or more rejoice by Cupid bound ; Of laughing girls in smiling couplets tell , And paint the dark-brow 'd grove , where wood-nymphs dwell ; Who bid invading youths their vengeance feel , And pierce the votive hearts they mean to heal . Such were the themes I knew in school-day ease , When first the moral magic learn 'd to please , Ere Judgment told how transports warm 'd the breast , Transported Fancy there her stores imprest ; The soul in varied raptures learn 'd to fly , Felt all their force , and never question 'd why ; No idle doubts could then her peace molest , She found delight , and left to heaven the rest ; Soft joys in Evening 's placid shades were born ; And where sweet fragrance wing 'd the balmy morn , When the wild thought roved vision 's circuit o'er , And caught the raptures , caught , alas ! no more : No care did then a dull attention ask , For study pleased , and that was every task ; No guilty dreams stalk 'd that heaven-favour 'd round , Heaven-guarded , too , no Envy entrance found ; Nor numerous wants , that vex advancing age , Nor Flattery 's silver tale , nor Sorrow 's sage ; Frugal Affliction kept each growing dart , To o'erwhelm in future days the bleeding heart . No sceptic art veil 'd Pride in Truth 's disguise , But prayer unsoil 'd of doubt besieged the skies ; Ambition , avarice , care , to man retired , Nor came desires more quick than joys desired . A summer morn there was , and passing fair , Still was the breeze , and health perfumed the air ; The glowing east in crimson 'd splendour shone , What time the eye just marks the pallid moon , Vi'lethYpppHeNwing ' d Zephyr fann 'd each opening flower , And brush 'd from fragrant cups the limpid shower ; A distant huntsman fill 'd his cheerful horn , The vivid dew hung trembling on the thorn , And mists , like creeping rocks , arose to meet the morn . Huge giant shadows spread along the plain , Or shot from towering rocks o'er half the main , There to the slumbering bark the gentle tide Stole soft , and faintly beat against its side ; Such is that sound , which fond designs convey , When , true to love , the damsel speeds away ; The sails unshaken , hung aloft unfurl 'd , And simpering nigh , the languid current curl 'd ; A crumbling ruin , once a city 's pride , The well-pleased eye through withering oaks descried , Where Sadness , gazing on time 's ravage , hung , And Silence to Destruction 's trophy clung -  Save that as morning songsters swell 'd their lays , Awaken 'd Echo humm 'd repeated praise : The lark on quavering pinion woo 'd the day , Less towering linnets fill 'd the vocal spray , And song-invited pilgrims rose to pray . Here at a pine-press 'd hill 's embroider 'd base I stood , and hail 'd the Genius of the place . Then was it doom 'd by fate , my idle heart , Soften 'd by Nature , gave access to Art ; The Muse approach 'd , her syren-song I heard , Her magic felt , and all her charms revered : E'er since she rules in absolute control , And Mira only dearer to my soul . Ah ! tell me not these empty joys to fly , If they deceive , I would deluded die ; To the fond themes my heart so early wed , So soon in life to blooming visions led , So prone to run the vague uncertain course , ‘ Tis more than death to think of a divorce . What wills the poet of the favouring gods , Led to their shrine , and blest in their abodes ? What when he fills the glass , and to each youth Names his loved maid , and glories in his truth ? Not India 's spoils , the splended nabob 's pride , Not the full trade of Hermes ’ own Cheapside , Nor gold itself , nor all the Ganges laves , Or shrouds , well shrouded in his sacred waves ; Nor gorgeous vessels deck 'd in trim array , Which the more noble Thames bears far away ; Let those whose nod makes sooty subjects flee ? Hack with blunt steel the savory callipee ; Let those whose ill-used wealth their country fly , Virtue-scorn 'd wines from hostile<country>France</country>to buy ; Favour 'd by Fate , let such in joy appear , Their smuggled cargoes landed thrice a year ; Disdaining these , for simpler food I 'll look , And crop my beverage at the mantled brook . O Virtue ! brighter than the noon-tide ray , My humble prayers with sacred joys repay ! Health to my limbs may the kind gods impart , And thy fair form delight my yielding heart ! Grant me to shun each vile inglorious road , To see thy way , and trace each moral good : If more — let Wisdom 's sons my page peruse , And decent credit deck my modest Muse . Nor deem it pride that prophesies my song Shall please the sons of taste , and please them long . Say ye ! to whom my Muse submissive brings Her first-fruit offering , and on trembling wings , May she not hope in future days to soar , Where fancy 's sons have led the way before ? Where genius strives in each ambrosial bower To snatch with agile hand the opening flower ? To cull what sweets adorn the mountain 's brow , What humbler blossoms crown the vales below ? To blend with these the stores by art refined , And give the moral Flora to the mind ? Far other scenes my timid hour admits , Relentless critics and avenging wits ; E'en coxcombs take a licence from their pen , And to each “ Let him perish , ” cry Amen ! And thus , with wits or fools my heart shall cry , For if they please not , let the trifles die : Die , and be lost in dark oblivion 's shore , And never rise to vex their author more . I would not dream o'er some soft liquid line , Amid a thousand blunders form 'd to shine ; Yet rather this , than that dull scribbler be , From every fault and every beauty free , Curst with tame thoughts and mediocrity . Some have I found so thick beset with spots , ‘ Twas hard to trace their beauties through their blots ; And these , as tapers round a sick man 's room Or passing chimes , but warn 'd me of the tomb ! O ! if you blast , at once consume my bays , And damn me not with mutilated praise . With candour judge ; and , a young bard in view , Allow for that , and judge with kindness too ; Faults he must own , though hard for him to find , Not to some happier merits quite so blind ; These if mistaken Fancy only sees , Or Hope , that takes Deformity for these : If Dunce , the crowd-befitting title falls His lot , and Dulness her new subject calls , To the poor bard alone your censures give -  Let his fame die , but let his honour live ; Laugh if you must — be candid as you can , And when you lash the Poet , spare the Man .</docImprint>
