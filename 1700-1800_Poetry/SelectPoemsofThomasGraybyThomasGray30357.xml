    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Many editions of Gray have been published in the last fifty years , some of them very elegant , and some showing considerable editorial labor , but not one , so far as I am aware , critically exact either in text or in notes . No editor since Mathias ( A. D. 1814 ) has given the 2d line of the Elegy as Gray wrote and printed it ; while Mathias 's mispunctuation of the 123d line has been copied by his successors , almost without exception . Other variations from the early editions are mentioned in the notes .</p>
    <p n="2">It is a curious fact that the most accurate edition of Gray 's collected poems is the editio princeps of 1768 , printed under his own supervision . The first edition of the two Pindaric odes , The Progress of Poesy and The Bard ( Strawberry-Hill , 1757 ) , was printed with equal care , and the proofs were probably read by the poet . The text of the present edition has been collated , line by line , with that of these early editions , and in no instance have I adopted a later reading . All the MS. variations , and the various readings I have noted in the modern editions , are given in the notes .</p>
    <p n="3">Pickering 's edition of 1835 , edited by Mitford , has been followed blindly in nearly all the more recent editions , and its many errors ( see pp . 84 and 105 , foot-notes ) have been faithfully reproduced . Even its blunders in the “ indenting ” of the lines in the corresponding stanzas of the two Pindaric odes , which any careful proof-reader ought to have corrected , have been copied again and again — as in the Boston ( 1853 ) reprint of Pickering , the pretty little edition of Bickers &amp; Son ( London , n. d .) , the fac-simile of the latter printed at our University Press , Cambridge ( 1866 ) , etc .</p>
    <p n="4">Of former editions of Gray , the only one very fully annotated is Mitford 's ( Pickering , 1835 ) , already mentioned . I have drawn freely from that , correcting many errors , and also from Wakefield 's and Mason 's editions , and from Hales 's notes ( Longer English Poems , London , 1872 ) on the Elegy and the Pindaric odes . To all this material many original notes and illustrations have been added .</p>
    <p n="5">The facts concerning the first publication of the Elegy are not given correctly by any of the editors , and even the “ experts ” of Notes and Queries have not been able to disentangle the snarl of conflicting evidence . I am not sure that I have settled the question myself ( see p. 74 and foot-note ) , but I have at least shown that Gray is a more credible witness in the case than any of his critics . Their testimony is obviously inconsistent and inconclusive ; he may have confounded the names of two magazines , but that remains to be proved .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
    <note xml:id="note1" place="bottom" n="1">Since writing the above to-day , I have found by the merest chance in my own library another bit of evidence in the case , which fully confirms my surmise that the Elegy was printed in The Magazine of Magazines before it appeared in the Grand Magazine of Magazines . Chambers 's Book of Days ( vol . ii . p. 146 ) , in an article on “ Gray and his Elegy , ” says :</note>
    <p n="6">“ It first saw the light in The Magazine of Magazines , February , 1751 . Some imaginary literary wag is made to rise in a convivial assembly , and thus announce it : ‘ Gentlemen , give me leave to soothe my own melancholy , and amuse you in a most noble manner , with a full copy of verses by the very ingenious Mr. Gray , of Peterhouse , Cambridge . They are stanzas written in a country churchyard . ’ Then follow the verses . A few days afterwards , Dodsley 's edition appeared , ” etc .</p>
    <p n="7">The same authority gives the four stanzas omitted after the 18th ( see p. 79 ) as they appear in the North American Review , except that the first line of the third is “ Hark how the sacred calm that reigns around , ” a reading which I have found nowhere else . The stanza “ There scattered oft , ” etc . ( p. 81 ) , is given as in the review . The reading on p. 82 must be a later one . ]</p>
    <p n="8">I have retained most of the “ parallel passages ” from the poets given by the editors , and have added others , without regard to the critics who have sneered at this kind of annotations . Whether Gray borrowed from the others , or the others from him , matters little ; very likely , in most instances , neither party was consciously the borrower . Gray , in his own notes , has acknowledged certain debts to other poets , and probably these were all that he was aware of . Some of these he contracted unwittingly ( see what he says of one of them in a letter to Walpole , quoted in the note on the Ode on the Spring , 31 ) , and the same may have been true of some apparently similar cases pointed out by modern editors . To me , however , the chief interest of these coincidences and resemblances of thought or expression is as studies in the “ comparative anatomy ” of poetry . The teacher will find them useful as pegs to hang questions upon , or texts for oral instruction . The pupil , or the young reader , who finds out who all these poets were , when they lived , what they wrote , etc ., will have learned no small amount of English literary history . If he studies the quotations merely as illustrations of style and expression , or as examples of the poetic diction of various periods , he will have learned some lessons in the history and the use of his mother-tongue .</p>

    <docTitle><titlePart>THE LIFE OF THOMAS GRAY . BY ROBERT CARRUTHERS . Thomas Gray , the author of the celebrated Elegy written in a Country Churchyard , was born in Cornhill , London , December 26 , 1716 . His father , Philip Gray , an exchange broker and scrivener , was a wealthy and nominally respectable citizen , but he treated his family with brutal severity and neglect , and the poet was altogether indebted for the advantages of a learned education to the affectionate care and industry of his mother , whose maiden name was Antrobus , and who , in conjunction with a maiden sister , kept a millinery shop . A brother of Mrs. Gray was assistant to the Master of Eton , and was also a fellow of Pembroke College , Cambridge . Under his protection the poet was educated at Eton , and from thence went to Peterhouse , attending college from 1734 to September , 1738 . At Eton he had as contemporaries Richard West , son of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland , and Horace Walpole , son of the triumphant Whig minister , Sir Robert Walpole . West died early in his 26th year , but his genius and virtues and his sorrows will forever live in the correspondence of his friend . In the spring of 1739 , Gray was invited by Horace Walpole to accompany him as travelling companion in a tour through France and Italy . They made the usual route , and Gray wrote remarks on all he saw in Florence , Rome , Naples , etc . His observations on arts and antiquities , and his sketches of foreign manners , evince his admirable taste , learning , and discrimination . Since Milton , no such accomplished English traveller had visited those classic shores . In their journey through Dauphiny , Gray 's attention was strongly arrested by the wild and picturesque site of the Grande Chartreuse , surrounded by its dense forest of beech and fir , its enormous precipices , cliffs , and cascades . He visited it a second time on his return , and in the album of the mountain convent he wrote his famous Alcaic Ode . At Reggio the travellers quarrelled and parted . Walpole took the whole blame on himself . He was fond of pleasure and amusements , “ intoxicated by vanity , indulgence , and the insolence of his situation as a prime minister 's son ” — his own confession — while Gray was studious , of a serious disposition , and independent spirit . The immediate cause of the rupture is said to have been Walpole 's clandestinely opening , reading , and resealing a letter addressed to Gray , in which he expected to find a confirmation of his suspicions that Gray had been writing unfavourably of him to some friends in England . A partial reconciliation was effected about three years afterwards by the intervention of a lady , and Walpole redeemed his youthful error by a life-long sincere admiration and respect for his friend . From Reggio Gray proceeded to Venice , and thence travelled homewards , attended by a laquais de voyage . He arrived in England in September , 1741 , having been absent about two years and a half . His father died in November , and it was found that the poet 's fortune would not enable him to prosecute the study of the law . He therefore retired to Cambridge , and fixed his residence at the university . There he continued for the remainder of his life , with the exception of about two years spent in London , when the treasures of the British Museum were thrown open . At Cambridge he had the range of noble libraries . His happiness consisted in study , and he perused with critical attention the Greek and Roman poets , philosophers , historians , and orators . Plato and the Anthologia he read and annotated with great care , as if for publication . He compiled tables of Greek chronology , added notes to Linnæus and other naturalists , wrote geographical disquisitions on Strabo ; and , besides being familiar with French and Italian literature , was a zealous archæological student , and profoundly versed in architecture , botany , painting , and music . In all departments of human learning , except mathematics , he was a master . But it follows that one so studious , so critical , and so fastidious , could not be a voluminous writer . A few poems include all the original compositions of Gray — the quintessence , as it were , of thirty years of ceaseless study and contemplation , irradiated by bright and fitful gleams of inspiration . In 1742 Gray composed his Ode to Spring , his Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College , and his Ode to Adversity — productions which most readers of poetry can repeat from memory . He commenced a didactic poem , On the Alliance of Education and Government , but wrote only about a hundred lines . Every reader must regret that this philosophical poem is but a fragment . It is in the style and measure of Dryden , of whom Gray was an ardent admirer and close student . His Elegy written in a Country Churchyard was completed and published in 1751 . In the form of a sixpenny brochure it circulated rapidly , four editions being exhausted the first year . This popularity surprised the poet . He said sarcastically that it was owing entirely to the subject , and that the public would have received it as well if it had been written in prose . The solemn and affecting nature of the poem , applicable to all ranks and classes , no doubt aided its sale ; it required high poetic sensibility and a cultivated taste to appreciate the rapid transitions , the figurative language , and lyrical magnificence of the odes ; but the elegy went home to all hearts ; while its musical harmony , originality , and pathetic train of sentiment and feeling render it one of the most perfect of English poems . No vicissitudes of taste or fashion have affected its popularity . When the original manuscript of the poem was lately ( 1854 ) offered for sale , it brought the almost incredible sum of 131 pounds . The two great odes of Gray , The Progress of Poetry and The Bard , were published in 1757 , and were but coldly received . His name , however , stood high , and on the death of Cibber , the same year , he was offered the laureateship , which he wisely declined . He was ambitious , however , of obtaining the more congenial and dignified appointment of Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge , which fell vacant in 1762 , and , by the advice of his friends , he made application to Lord Bute , but was unsuccessful . Lord Bute had designed it for the tutor of his son-in-law , Sir James Lowther . No one had heard of the tutor , but the Bute influence was all-prevailing . In 1765 Gray took a journey into Scotland , penetrating as far north as Dunkeld and the Pass of Killiecrankie ; and his account of his tour , in letters to his friends , is replete with interest and with touches of his peculiar humour and graphic description . One other poem proceeded from his pen . In 1768 the Professorship of Modern History was again vacant , and the Duke of Grafton bestowed it upon Gray . A sum of 400 pounds per annum was thus added to his income ; but his health was precarious — he had lost it , he said , just when he began to be easy in his circumstances . The nomination of the Duke of Grafton to the office of Chancellor of the University enabled Gray to acknowledge the favour conferred on himself . He thought it better that gratitude should sing than expectation , and he honoured his grace 's installation with an ode . Such occasional productions are seldom happy ; but Gray preserved his poetic dignity and select beauty of expression . He made the founders of Cambridge , as Mr. Hallam has remarked , “ pass before our eyes like shadows over a magic glass . ” When the ceremony of the installation was over , the poet-professor went on a tour to the lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland , and few of the beauties of the lake-country , since so famous , escaped his observation . This was to be his last excursion . While at dinner one day in the college-hall he was seized with an attack of gout in his stomach , which resisted all the powers of medicine , and proved fatal in less than a week . He died on the 30th of July , 1771 , and was buried , according to his own desire , beside the remains of his mother at Stoke-Pogis , near Slough , in Buckinghamshire , in a beautiful sequestered village churchyard that is supposed to have furnished the scene of his elegy .<span corresp="#note1_2" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The literary habits and personal peculiarities of Gray are familiar to us from the numerous representations and allusions of his friends . It is easy to fancy the recluse-poet sitting in his college-chambers in the old quadrangle of Pembroke Hall . His windows are ornamented with mignonette and choice flowers in China vases , but outside may be discerned some iron-work intended to be serviceable as a fire-escape , for he has a horror of fire . His furniture is neat and select ; his books , rather for use than show , are disposed around him . He has a harpsichord in the room . In the corner of one of the apartments is a trunk containing his deceased mother 's dresses , carefully folded up and preserved . His fastidiousness , bordering upon effeminacy , is visible in his gait and manner — in his handsome features and small , well-dressed person , especially when he walks abroad and sinks the author and hard student in “ the gentleman who sometimes writes for his amusement . ” He writes always with a crow-quill , speaks slowly and sententiously , and shuns the crew of dissonant college revellers , who call him “ a prig , ” and seek to annoy him . Long mornings of study , and nights feverish from ill-health , are spent in those chambers ; he is often listless and in low spirits ; yet his natural temper is not desponding , and he delights in employment . He has always something to learn or to communicate — some sally of humour or quiet stroke of satire for his friends and correspondents — some note on natural history to enter in his journal — some passage of Plato to unfold and illustrate — some golden thought of classic inspiration to inlay on his page — some bold image to tone down — some verse to retouch and harmonize . His life is on the whole innocent and happy , and a feeling of thankfulness to the Great Giver is breathed over all . [ Footnote 1 : A claim has been put up for the churchyard of Granchester , about two miles from Cambridge , the great bell of St. Mary 's serving for the “ curfew . ” But Stoke-Pogis is more likely to have been the spot , if any individual locality were indicated . The poet often visited the village , his aunt and mother residing there , and his aunt was interred in the churchyard of the place . Gray 's epitaph on his mother is characterized not only by the tenderness with which he always regarded her memory , but by his style and cast of thought . It runs thus : “ Beside her friend and sister here sleep the remains of Dorothy Gray , widow , the careful , tender mother of many children , one of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her . She died March 11 , 1753 , aged 72 . ” She had lived to read the Elegy , which was perhaps an ample recompense for her maternal cares and affection . Mrs. Gray 's will commences in a similar touching strain : “ In the name of God , amen . This is the last will and desire of Dorothy Gray to her son Thomas Gray . ” [ Cunningham 's edit . of Johnson 's Lives . ] They were all in all to each other . The father 's cruelty and neglect , their straitened circumstances , the sacrifices made by the mother to maintain her son at the university , her pride in the talents and conduct of that son , and the increasing gratitude and affection of the latter , nursed in his scholastic and cloistered solitude — these form an affecting but noble record in the history of genius .</titlePart></docTitle>

  <body>
   <note>One would infer from the above that Mrs. Gray was not “ interred in the churchyard of the place , ” though the epitaph given immediately after shows that she was . Gray in his will directed that he should be laid beside her there . The passage in the will reads thus : “ First , I do desire that my body may be deposited in the vault , made by my dear mother in the churchyard of Stoke-Pogeis , near Slough in Buckinghamshire , by her remains , in a coffin of seasoned oak , neither lined nor covered , and ( unless it be inconvenient ) I could wish that one of my executors may see me laid in the grave , and distribute among such honest and industrious poor persons in said parish as he thinks fit , the sum of ten pounds in charity . ” — Ed .</note>
   <p>Various editions of the collected works of Gray have been published . The first , including memoirs of his life and his correspondence , edited by his friend , the Rev . W. Mason , appeared in 1775 . It has been often reprinted , and forms the groundwork of the editions by Mathias ( 1814 ) and Mitford ( 1816 ) . Mr. Mitford , in 1843 , published Gray 's correspondence with the Rev . Norton Nicholls ; and in 1854 another collection of Gray 's letters was published , edited also by Mr. Mitford . Every scrap of the poet 's MSS . is eagerly sought after , and every year seems to add to his popularity as a poet and letter-writer .</p>
   <p>In 1778 a monument to Gray was erected in Westminster Abbey by Mason , with the following inscription :</p>

     <l n="1">It is at Stoke-Pogis that we seek the most attractive vestiges of</l>
     <l n="2">Gray . Here he used to spend his vacations , not only when a youth at</l>
     <l n="3">Eton , but during the whole of his future life , while his mother and</l>
     <l n="4">his aunts lived . Here it was that his Ode on a Distant Prospect of</l>
     <l n="5">Eton College , his celebrated Elegy written in a Country</l>
     <l n="6">Churchyard , and his Long Story were not only written , but were</l>
     <l n="7">mingled with the circumstances and all the tenderest feelings of his</l>
     <l n="8">own life .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His mother and aunts lived at an old-fashioned house in a very retired spot at Stoke , called West-End . This house stood in a hollow , much screened by trees . A small stream ran through the garden , and it is said that Gray used to employ himself when here much in this garden , and that many of the trees still remaining are of his planting . On one side of the house extended an upland field , which was planted round so as to give a charming retired walk ; and at the summit of the field was raised an artificial mound , and upon it was built a sort of arcade or summer-house , which gave full prospect of Windsor and Eton . Here Gray used to delight to sit ; here he was accustomed to read and write much ; and it is just the place to inspire the Ode on Eton College , which lay in the midst of its fine landscape , beautifully in view . The old house inhabited by Gray and his mother has just been pulled down , and replaced by an Elizabethan mansion by the present proprietor , Mr. Penn , of Stoke Park , just by .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The garden , of course , has shared in the change , and now stands gay with its fountain and its modern greenhouse , and , excepting for some fine trees , no longer reminds you of Gray . The woodland walk still remains round the adjoining field , and the summer-house on its summit , though now much cracked by time , and only held together by iron cramps . The trees are now so lofty that they completely obstruct the view , and shut out both Eton and Windsor .</p>
   <note xml:id="note2" place="bottom" n="2">This was written ( or published , at least ) in 1846 ; but Mitford , in the Life of Gray prefixed to the “ Eton edition ” of his Poems , published in 1847 , says : “ The house , which is now called West-End , lies in a secluded part of the parish , on the road to Fulmer . It has lately been much enlarged and adorned by its present proprietor [ Mr. Penn ] , but the room called ‘ Gray 's ’ ( distinguished by a small balcony ) is still preserved ; and a shady walk round an adjoining meadow , with a summer-house on the rising land , are still remembered as favourite places frequented by the poet . ” — Ed .</note>
   <p>Stoke Park is about a couple of miles from Slough . The country is flat , but its monotony is broken up by the noble character and disposition of its woods . Near the house is a fine expanse of water , across which the eye falls on fine views , particularly to the south , of Windsor Castle , Cooper 's Hill , and the Forest Woods . About three hundred yards from the north front of the house stands a column , sixty-eight feet high , bearing on the top a colossal statue of Sir Edward Coke , by Rosa . The woods of the park shut out the view of West-End House , Gray 's occasional residence , but the space is open from the mansion across the park , so as to take in the view both of the church and of a monument erected by the late Mr. Penn to Gray . Alighting from the carriage at a lodge , we enter the park just at the monument . This is composed of fine freestone , and consists of a large sarcophagus , supported on a square pedestal , with inscriptions on each side . Three of them are selected from the Ode on Eton College and the Elegy . They are :</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hard by yon wood , now smiling as in scorn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove ;</l>

   <p>This Monument , in honour of THOMAS GRAY , Was erected A. D. 1799 , Among the scenery Celebrated by that great Lyric and Elegiac Poet . He died in 1771 , And lies unnoted in the adjoining Church-yard , Under the Tomb-stone on which he piously And pathetically recorded the interment Of his Aunt and lamented Mother .</p>
   <p>This monument is in a neatly kept garden-like enclosure , with a winding walk approaching from the shade of the neighbouring trees . To the right , across the park , at some little distance , backed by fine trees , stands the rural little church and churchyard where Gray wrote his Elegy , and where he lies . As you walk on to this , the mansion closes the distant view between the woods with fine effect . The church has often been engraved , and is therefore tolerably familiar to the general reader . It consists of two barn-like structures , with tall roofs , set side by side , and the tower and finely tapered spire rising above them at the northwest corner . The church is thickly hung with ivy , where</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The moping owl may to the moon complain</l>
     <l n="2">Of such as , wandering near her secret bower ,</l>
     <l n="3">Molest her ancient , solitary reign . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The structure is as simple and old-fashioned , both without and within , as any village church can well be . No village , however , is to be seen . Stoke consists chiefly of scattered houses , and this is now in the midst of the park . In the churchyard ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Beneath those rugged elms , that yew-tree 's shade ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap ,</l>
     <l n="3">Each in his narrow cell forever laid ,</l>
     <l n="4">The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>All this is quite literal ; and the tomb of the poet himself , near the southeast window , completes the impression of the scene . It is a plain brick altar tomb , covered with a blue slate slab , and , besides his own ashes , contains those of his mother and aunt . On the slab are inscribed the following lines by Gray himself : “ In the vault beneath are deposited , in hope of a joyful resurrection , the remains of Mary Antrobus . She died unmarried , Nov. 5 , 1749 , aged sixty-six . In the same pious confidence , beside her friend and sister , here sleep the remains of Dorothy Gray , widow ; the careful , tender mother of many children , ONE of whom alone had the misfortune to survive her . She died , March 11 , 1753 , aged LXXII . ”</p>
   <p>No testimony of the interment of Gray in the same tomb was inscribed anywhere till Mr. Penn , in 1799 , erected the monument already mentioned , and placed a small slab in the wall , under the window , opposite to the tomb itself , recording the fact of Gray 's burial there . The whole scene is well worthy of a summer day 's stroll , especially for such as , pent in the metropolis , know how to enjoy the quiet freshness of the country and the associations of poetry and the past .</p>

   <p>ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD .</p>
   <p>This poem was begun in the year 1742 , but was not finished until 1750 , when Gray sent it to Walpole with a letter ( dated June 12 , 1750 ) in which he says : “ I have been here at Stoke a few days ( where I shall continue good part of the summer ) , and having put an end to a thing , whose beginning you have seen long ago , I immediately send it you . You will , I hope , look upon it in the light of a thing with an end to it : a merit that most of my writings have wanted , and are like to want . ” It was shown in manuscript to some of the author 's friends , and was published in 1751 only because it was about to be printed surreptitiously .</p>
   <p>February 11 , 1751 , Gray wrote to Walpole that the proprietors of “ the Magazine of Magazines ” were about to publish his Elegy , and added , “ I have but one bad way left to escape the honour they would inflict upon me ; and therefore am obliged to desire you would make Dodsley print it immediately ( which may be done in less than a week 's time ) from your copy , but without my name , in what form is most convenient for him , but on his best paper and character ; he must correct the press himself ,<span corresp="#note1_3" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and print it without any interval between the stanzas , because the sense is in some places continued beyond them ; and the title must be — ‘ Elegy , written in a Country Churchyard . ’ If he would add a line or two to say it came into his hands by accident , I should like it better . ” Walpole did as requested , and wrote an advertisement to the effect that accident alone brought the poem before the public , although an apology was unnecessary to any but the author . On which Gray wrote , “ I thank you for your advertisement , which saves my honour . ”</p>
   <note xml:id="note1_3" place="bottom" n="1">Dodsley 's proof-reading must have been somewhat careless , for there are many errors of the press in this editio princeps . Gray writes to Walpole , under date of “ Ash-Wednesday , Cambridge , 1751 , ” as follows : “ Nurse Dodsley has given it a pinch or two in the cradle , that ( I doubt ) it will bear the marks of as long as it lives . But no matter : we have ourselves suffered under her hands before now ; and besides , it will only look the more careless and by accident as it were . ” Again , March 3 , 1751 , he writes : “ I do not expect any more editions ; as I have appeared in more magazines than one . The chief errata were sacred for secret ; hidden for kindred ( in spite of dukes and classics ) ; and ‘ frowning as in scorn ’ for smiling . I humbly propose , for the benefit of Mr. Dodsley and his matrons , that take awake [ in line 92 , which at first read “ awake and faithful to her wonted fires ” ] for a verb , that they should read asleep , and all will be right . ” Other errors were , “ Their harrow oft the stubborn glebe , ” “ And read their destiny in a nation 's eyes , ” “ With uncouth rhymes and shapeless culture decked , ” “ Slow through the churchway pass , ” and many of minor importance .</note>
   <p>A writer in Notes and Queries , June 12 , 1875 , states that the poem first appeared in the London Magazine , March , 1751 , p. 134 , and that “ the Magazine of Magazines ” is “ a gentle term of scorn used by Gray to indicate ” that periodical , and not the name of any actual magazine . But in the next number of Notes and Queries ( June 19 , 1875 ) Mr. F. Locker informs us that he has in his possession a title-page of the Grand Magazine of Magazines , and the page of the number for April , 1751 , which contains the Elegy . The magazine is said to be “ collected and digested by Roger Woodville , Esq ., ” and “ published by Cooper at the Globe , in Pater Noster Row . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Gray says nothing in his letters of the appearance of the Elegy in</l>
     <l n="2">the London Magazine . The full title of that periodical was “ The</l>
     <l n="3">London Magazine : or Gentleman 's Monthly Intelligencer . ” The editor 's</l>
     <l n="4">name was not given ; the publisher was “ R. Baldwin , jun . at the Rose</l>
     <l n="5">in Pater-Noster Row . ” The volume for 1751 was the 20th , and the</l>
     <l n="6">Preface ( written at the close of the year ) begins thus : “ As the two</l>
     <l n="7">most formidable Enemies we have ever had , are now extinct , we have</l>
     <l n="8">great Reason to conclude , that it is only the Merit , and real</l>
     <l n="9">Usefulness of our COLLECTION , that hath supported its Sale and</l>
     <l n="10">Reputation for Twenty Years . ” A foot-note informs us that the</l>
     <l n="11">“ Enemies ” are the “ Magazine of Magazines and Grand Magazine of</l>
     <l n="12">Magazines ; ” from which it would appear that there were two</l>
     <l n="13">periodicals of similar name published in London in 1751 .<span corresp="#note2_2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note2_2" place="bottom" n="2">May not the Elegy have been printed in both of these ? We do not know how otherwise to reconcile the conflicting statements concerning the “ Magazine of Magazines , ” as Gray calls it . In the first place , Gray appears ( from other portions of his letter to Walpole ) to be familiar with this magazine , and would not be likely to confound it with another of similar name . Then , as we have seen , he writes early in March to Walpole that the poem has been printed “ in more magazines than one . ” This cannot refer to the Grand Magazine of Magazines , if , as Mr. Locker states , it was the April number of that periodical in which the poem appeared . Nor can it refer to the London Magazine , as it is clear from internal evidence that the March number , containing the Elegy , was not issued until early in April . It contains a summary of current news down to Sunday , March 31 , and the price of stocks in the London market for March 30 . The February number , in its “ monthly catalogue ” of new books , records the publication of the Elegy by Dodsley thus : “ An Elegy wrote in a Church-yard , pr . 6d . Dodsley . ”</note>
   <p>If , then , the Elegy did not appear in either the London Magazine or the Grand Magazine of Magazines until more than a month ( in the case of the latter , perhaps two months ) after Dodsley had issued it , in what magazine was it that it did appear just before he issued it ? The N. A . Review says that “ it was a close race between the Magazine and Dodsley ; but the former , having a little the start , came out a few days ahead . ” If so , it must have been the March number ; or the February one , if it was published , like the London , at the end of the month . Gray calls it “ the Magazine of Magazines , ” and we shall take his word for it until we have reason for doubting it . What else was included in his “ more magazines than one ” we cannot even guess .</p>
   <p>We have not been able to find the Magazine of Magazines or the Grand Magazine of Magazines in the libraries , and know nothing about either “ of our own knowledge . ” The London Magazine is in the Harvard College Library , and the statements concerning that we can personally vouch for . ]</p>
   <p>The author 's name is not given with the Elegy as printed in the London Magazine . The poem is sandwiched between an “ Epilogue to Alfred , a Masque ” and some coarse rhymes entitled “ Strip-Me-Naked , or Royal Gin for ever . ” There is not even a printer 's “ rule ” or “ dash ” to separate the title of the latter from the last line of the Elegy . The poem is more correctly printed than in Dodsley 's authorized edition ; though , queerly enough , it has “ winds ” in the second line and the parenthesis “ ( all he had ) ” in the Epitaph . Of Dodsley 's misprints noted above it has only “ Their harrow oft ” and “ shapeless culture . ” These four errors , indeed , are the only ones worth noting , except “ Or wake to extasy the living lyre . ”</p>
   <p>The “ Magazine of Magazines ” ( as the writer in the North American Review tells us ) printed the Elegy with the author 's name . The authorized though anonymous edition was thus briefly noticed by The Monthly Review , the critical Rhadamanthus of the day : “ An Elegy in a Country Churchyard . 4to . Dodsley 's . Seven pages .— The excellence of this little piece amply compensates for its want of quantity . ”</p>
   <p>“ Soon after its publication , ” says Mason , “ I remember , sitting with Mr. Gray in his College apartment , he expressed to me his surprise at the rapidity of its sale . I replied :</p>
   <p>‘ Sunt lacrymae rerum , et mentem mortalia tangunt . ’</p>
   <p>He paused awhile , and taking his pen , wrote the line on a printed copy of it lying on his table . ‘ This , ’ said he , ‘ shall be its future motto . ’ ‘ Pity , ’ cried I , ‘ that Dr. Young 's Night Thoughts have preoccupied it . ’ ‘ So , ’ replied he , ‘ indeed it is . ’ ” Gray himself tells the story of its success on the margin of the manuscript copy of the Elegy preserved at Cambridge among his papers , and reproduced in fac-simile in Mathias 's elegant edition of the poet . The following is a careful transcript of the memorandum :</p>
   <p>“ publish 'd in Feb :^{ ry }, 1751. by Dodsley : &amp; went thro ’ four Editions ; in two months ; and af - terwards a fifth 6 ^{ th } 7 ^{ th } &amp; 8 ^{ th } 9 ^{ th } &amp; 10 ^{ th } &amp; 11 ^{ th } printed also in 1753 with M ^ r Bentley 's Designs , of w ^{ ch } there is a 2 ^ d Edition &amp; again by Dodsley in his Miscellany , Vol : 4 ^{ th } &amp; in a Scotch Collection call 'd the Union . translated into Latin by Chr : Anstey Esq , &amp; the Rev ^ d M ^ r Roberts , &amp; publish 'd in 1762 ; &amp; again in the same year by Rob : Lloyd , M : A : ”</p>
   <p>“ One peculiar and remarkable tribute to the merit of the Elegy , ” says Professor Henry Reed , “ is to be noticed in the great number of translations which have been made of it into various languages , both of ancient and modern Europe . It is the same kind of tribute which has been rendered to Robinson Crusoe and to The Pilgrim 's Progress , and is proof of the same universality of interest , transcending the limits of language and of race . To no poem in the English language has the same kind of homage been paid so abundantly . Of what other poem is there a polyglot edition ? Italy and England have competed with their polyglot editions of the Elegy : Torri 's , bearing the title , ‘ Elegia di Tomaso Gray sopra un Cimitero di Campagna , tradotta dall ’ Inglese in più lingue : Verona , 1817 ; Livorno , 1843 ; ’ and Van Voorst 's London edition . ” Professor Reed adds a list of the translations ( which , however , is incomplete ) , including one in Hebrew , seven in Greek , twelve in Latin , thirteen in Italian , fifteen in French , six in German , and one in Portuguese .</p>
   <p>“ Had Gray written nothing but his Elegy , ” remarks Byron , “ high as he stands , I am not sure that he would not stand higher ; it is the cornerstone of his glory . ”</p>
   <p>The tribute paid the poem by General Wolfe is familiar to all , but we cannot refrain from quoting Lord Mahon 's beautiful account of it in his History of England . On the night of September 13th , 1759 , the night before the battle on the Plains of Abraham , Wolfe was descending the St. Lawrence with a part of his troops . The historian says : “ Swiftly , but silently , did the boats fall down with the tide , unobserved by the enemy 's sentinels at their posts along the shore . Of the soldiers on board , how eagerly must every heart have throbbed at the coming conflict ! how intently must every eye have contemplated the dark outline , as it lay pencilled upon the midnight sky , and as every moment it grew closer and clearer , of the hostile heights ! Not a word was spoken — not a sound heard beyond the rippling of the stream . Wolfe alone — thus tradition has told us — repeated in a low tone to the other officers in his boat those beautiful stanzas with which a country churchyard inspired the muse of Gray . One noble line ,</p>
   <p>‘ The paths of glory lead but to the grave , ’</p>
   <p>must have seemed at such a moment fraught with mournful meaning . At the close of the recitation Wolfe added , ‘ Now , gentlemen , I would rather be the author of that poem than take Quebec . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Hales , in his Introduction to the poem , remarks : “ The Elegy is perhaps the most widely known poem in our language . The reason of this extensive popularity is perhaps to be sought in the fact that it expresses in an exquisite manner feelings and thoughts that are universal . In the current of ideas in the Elegy there is perhaps nothing that is rare , or exceptional , or out of the common way . The musings are of the most rational and obvious character possible ; it is difficult to conceive of any one musing under similar circumstances who should not muse so ; but they are not the less deep and moving on this account . The mystery of life does not become clearer , or less solemn and awful , for any amount of contemplation . Such inevitable , such everlasting questions as rise on the mind when one lingers in the precincts of Death can never lose their freshness , never cease to fascinate and to move . It is with such questions , that would have been commonplace long ages since if they could ever be so , that the Elegy deals . It deals with them in no lofty philosophical manner , but in a simple , humble , unpretentious way , always with the truest and the broadest humanity . The poet 's thoughts turn to the poor ; he forgets the fine tombs inside the church , and thinks only of the ‘ mouldering heaps ’ in the churchyard . Hence the problem that especially suggests itself is the potential greatness , when they lived , of the ‘ rude forefathers ’ that now lie at his feet . He does not , and cannot solve it , though he finds considerations to mitigate the sadness it must inspire ; but he expresses it in all its awfulness in the most effective language and with the deepest feeling ; and his expression of it has become a living part of our language . ”</p>
   <p>The writer in the North American Review ( vol . 96 ) from whom we have elsewhere quoted says of the Elegy : “ It is upon this that Gray 's fame as a poet must chiefly rest . By this he will be known forever alike to the lettered and the unlettered . Many , in future ages , who may never have heard of his classic Odes , his various learning , or his sparkling letters , will revere him only as the author of the Elegy . For this he will be enshrined through all time in the hearts of the myriads who shall speak our English tongue . For this his name will be held in glad remembrance in the far-off summer isles of the Pacific , and amidst the waste of polar snows . If he had written nothing else , his place as a leading poet in our language would still be assured . Many have asserted , with Johnson , that he was a mere mechanical poet — one who brought from without , but never found within ; that the gift of inspiration was not native to him ; that his imagination was borrowed finery , his fancy tinsel , and his invention the world 's well-worn jewels ; that whatever in his verse was poetic was not new , and what was new was not poetic ; that he was only an unworldly dyspeptic , living amid many books , and laboriously delving for a lifetime between musty covers , picking out now and then another 's gems and bits of ore , and fashioning them into ill-compacted mosaics , which he wrongly called his own . To all this the Elegy is a sufficient answer . It is not old — it is not bookish ; it is new and human . Books could not make its maker : he was born of the divine breath alone . Consider all the commentators , the scholiasts , the interpreters , the annotators , and other like book-worms , from Aristarchus down to Döderlein ; and may it not be said that , among them all , ‘ Nec viget quidquam simile aut secundum ? ’</p>
   <p>“ Gray wrote but little , yet he wrote that little well . He might have done far more for us ; the same is true of most men , even of the greatest . The possibilities of a life are always in advance of its performance . But we cannot say that his life was a wasted one . Even this little Elegy alone should go for much . For , suppose that he had never written this , but instead had done much else in other ways , according to his powers : that he had written many learned treatises ; that he had , with keen criticism , expounded and reconstructed Greek classics ; that he had , perchance , sat upon the woolsack , and laid rich offerings at the feet of blind Justice ;— taking the years together , would it have been , on the whole , better for him or for us ? Would he have added so much to the sum of human happiness ? He might thus have made himself a power for a time , to be dethroned by some new usurper in the realm of knowledge ; now he is a power and a joy forever to countless thousands . ”</p>
   <p>Two manuscripts of the Elegy , in Gray 's handwriting , still exist . Both were bequeathed by the poet , together with his library , letters , and many miscellaneous papers , to his friends the Rev . William Mason and the Rev . James Browne , as joint literary executors . Mason bequeathed the entire trust to Mr. Stonhewer . The latter , in making his will , divided the legacy into two parts . The larger share went to the Master and Fellows of Pembroke Hall . Among the papers , which are still in the possession of the College , was found a copy of the Elegy . An excellent fac-simile of this manuscript appears in Mathias 's edition of Gray , published in 1814 . In referring to it hereafter we shall designate it as the “ Pembroke ” MS .</p>
   <p>The remaining portion of Gray 's literary bequest , including the other manuscript of the Elegy , was left by Mr. Stonhewer to his friend , Mr . Bright . In 1845 Mr . Bright 's sons sold the collection at auction . The MS. of the Elegy was bought by Mr. Granville John Penn , of Stoke Park , for one hundred pounds — the highest sum that had ever been known to be paid for a single sheet of paper . In 1854 this manuscript came again into the market , and was knocked down to Mr. Robert Charles Wrightson , of Birmingham , for 131 pounds . On the 29th of May , 1875 , it was once more offered for sale in London , and was purchased by Sir William Fraser for 230 pounds , or about $ 1150 . A photographic reproduction of it was published in London in 1862 . For convenience we shall refer to it as the “ Wrightson ” MS .</p>
   <p>There can be little doubt that the Wrightson MS. is the original one , and that the Pembroke MS. is a fair copy made from it by the poet . The former contains a greater number of alterations , and varies more from the printed text . It bears internal evidence of being the rough draft , while the other represents a later stage of the poem . We will give the variations of both from the present version .<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></p>
   <note xml:id="note3" place="bottom" n="3">For the readings of the Wrightson MS. we have had to depend on Mason , Mitford , and other editors of the poem , and on the article in the North American Review , already referred to . The readings of the Pembroke MS. are taken from the engraved fac-simile in Mathias 's edition .</note>
   <p>The two stanzas of which a fac-simile is given on page 73 are from the Pembroke MS ., but the wood-cut hardly does justice to the feminine delicacy of the poet 's handwriting . ]</p>
   <p>The Wrightson MS. has in the first stanza , “ The lowing herd wind slowly , ” etc . See our note on this line , below .</p>
   <p>In the 2d stanza , it reads , “ And now the air , ” etc .</p>
   <p>The 5th stanza is as follows :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ For ever sleep : the breezy call of morn ,</l>

     <l n="15">Some Cæsar guiltless of his country 's blood . "[ 4 ]</l>

   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note4" place="bottom" n="4">The Saturday Review for June 19 , 1875 , has a long article on the change made by Gray in this stanza , entitled , “ A Lesson from Gray 's Elegy , ” from which we cull the following paragraphs :</note>
   <p>“ Gray , having first of all put down the names of three Romans as illustrations of his meaning , afterwards deliberately struck them out and put the names of three Englishmen instead . This is a sign of a change in the taste of the age , a change with which Gray himself had a good deal to do . The deliberate wiping out of the names of Cato , Tully , and Cæsar , to put in the names of Hampden , Milton , and Cromwell , seems to us so obviously a change for the better that there seems to be no room for any doubt about it . It is by no means certain that Gray 's own contemporaries would have thought the matter equally clear . We suspect that to many people in his day it must have seemed a daring novelty to draw illustrations from English history , especially from parts of English history which , it must be remembered , were then a great deal more recent than they are now . To be sure , in choosing English illustrations , a poet of Gray 's time was in rather a hard strait . If he chose illustrations from the century or two before his own time , he could only choose names which had hardly got free from the strife of recent politics . If , in a poem of the nature of the Elegy , he had drawn illustrations from earlier times of English history , he would have found but few people in his day likely to understand him ....</p>
   <p>“ The change which Gray made in this well-known stanza is not only an improvement in a particular poem , it is a sign of a general improvement in taste . He wrote first according to the vicious taste of an earlier time , and he then changed it according to his own better taste . And of that better taste he was undoubtedly a prophet to others . Gray 's poetry must have done a great deal to open men 's eyes to the fact that they were Englishmen , and that on them , as Englishmen , English things had a higher claim than Roman , and that to them English examples ought to be more speaking than Roman ones . But there is another side of the case not to be forgotten . Those who would have regretted the change from Cato , Tully , and Cæsar to Hampden , Milton , and Cromwell , those who perhaps really did think that the bringing in of Hampden , Milton , and Cromwell was a degradation of what they would have called the Muse , were certainly not those who had the truest knowledge of Cato , Tully , and Cæsar . The ‘ classic ’ taste from which Gray helped to deliver us was a taste which hardly deserves to be called a taste . Pardonable perhaps in the first heat of the Renaissance , when ‘ classic ’ studies and objects had the charm of novelty , it had become by his day a mere silly fashion . ” ]</p>
   <p>In 18th stanza , “ Or crown the shrine , ” etc .</p>
   <p>After this stanza , the MS. has the following four stanzas , now omitted :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The thoughtless world to Majesty may bow ,</l>
     <l n="2">Exalt the brave , and idolize success ;</l>
     <l n="3">But more to innocence their safety owe</l>
     <l n="4">Than Pow'r , or Genius , e'er conspir 'd to bless .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ And thou who , mindful of the unhonour 'd Dead ,</l>
     <l n="6">Dost in these notes their artless tale relate ,</l>
     <l n="7">By night and lonely contemplation led</l>
     <l n="8">To wander in the gloomy walks of fate :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ Hark ! how the sacred Calm , that breathes around ,</l>
     <l n="10">Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease ;</l>
     <l n="11">In still small accents whisp'ring from the ground</l>
     <l n="12">A grateful earnest of eternal peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">“ No more , with reason and thyself at strife ,</l>
     <l n="14">Give anxious cares and endless wishes room ;</l>
     <l n="15">But through the cool sequester 'd vale of life</l>
     <l n="16">Pursue the silent tenor of thy doom . "[ 5 ]</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note5" place="bottom" n="5">We follow Mason ( ed . 1778 ) in the text of these stanzas . The North American Review has “ Power and Genius ” in the first , and “ linger in the lonely walks ” in the second .</note>
   <p>The second of these stanzas has been remodelled and used as the 24th of the present version . Mason thought that there was a pathetic melancholy in all four which claimed preservation . The third he considered equal to any in the whole Elegy . The poem was originally intended to end here , the introduction of “ the hoary-headed swain ” being a happy after-thought .</p>
   <p>In the 19th stanza , the MS. has “ never learn 'd to stray . ”</p>
   <p>In the 21st stanza , “ fame and epitaph , ” etc .</p>
   <p>In the 23d stanza , the last line reads ,</p>
   <p>“ And buried ashes glow with social fires . ”</p>
   <p>“ Social ” subsequently became “ wonted , ” and other changes were made ( see p. 74 , foot-note ) before the line took its present form .</p>
   <p>The 24th stanza reads ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ If chance that e'er some pensive Spirit more ,</l>
     <l n="2">By sympathetic musings here delay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="3">With vain , though kind inquiry shall explore</l>
     <l n="4">Thy once-lov 'd haunt , this long-deserted shade . "[ 6 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <note xml:id="note6" place="bottom" n="6">Mitford ( Eton ed . ) gives “ sympathizing ” in the second line , and for the last ,</note>
   <p>“ Thy ever loved haunt — this long deserted shade . ”</p>
   <p>The latter is obviously wrong ( Gray was incapable of such metre ) , and the former is probably wrong also . ]</p>
   <p>The last line of the 25th stanza reads ,</p>
   <p>“ On the high brow of yonder hanging lawn . ”</p>
   <p>Then comes the following stanza , afterwards omitted :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Him have we seen the greenwood side along ,</l>
     <l n="2">While o'er the heath we hied , our labour done ,</l>
     <l n="3">Oft as the woodlark pip 'd her farewell song ,</l>
     <l n="4">With wistful eyes pursue the setting sun . "[ 7 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Mason remarked : “ I rather wonder that he rejected this stanza , as it not only has the same sort of Doric delicacy which charms us peculiarly in this part of the poem , but also completes the account of his whole day ; whereas , this evening scene being omitted , we have only his morning walk , and his noontide repose . ”</p>
   <note xml:id="note7" place="bottom" n="7">Here also we follow Mason ; the North American Review reads “ our labours done . ”</note>
   <p>The first line of the 27th stanza reads ,</p>
   <p>“ With gestures quaint , now smiling as in scorn . ”</p>
   <p>After the 29th stanza , and before the Epitaph , the MS. contains the following omitted stanza :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ There scatter 'd oft , the earliest of the year ,</l>
     <l n="2">By hands unseen are frequent violets found ;</l>
     <l n="3">The robin loves to build and warble there ,</l>
     <l n="4">And little footsteps lightly print the ground . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This — with two or three verbal changes only<span corresp="#note8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>— was inserted in all the editions up to 1753 , when it was dropped . The omission was not made from any objection to the stanza in itself , but simply because it was too long a parenthesis in this place ; on the principle which he states in a letter to Dr. Beattie : “ As to description , I have always thought that it made the most graceful ornament of poetry , but never ought to make the subject . ” The part was sacrificed for the good of the whole . Mason very justly remarked that “ the lines , however , are in themselves exquisitely fine , and demand preservation . ”</p>

   <note xml:id="note9" place="bottom" n="9">The above are all the variations from the present text in the Wrightson MS. which are noted by the authorities on whom we have depended ; but we suspect that the following readings , mentioned by Mitford as in the MS ., belong to that MS ., as they are not found in the other : in the 7th stanza , “ sickles ” for “ sickle ; ” in 18th , “ shrines ” for “ shrine . ” Two others ( in stanzas 9th and 27th ) are referred to in our account of the Pembroke MS. below .</note>
   <p>The Pembroke MS. has the following variations from the present version :</p>
   <p>In the 1st stanza , “ wind ” for “ winds . ”</p>
   <p>2d stanza , “ Or drowsy , ” etc .</p>
   <p>5th stanza , “ and the ecchoing horn . ”</p>
   <p>6th stanza , “ Nor climb his knees . ”</p>
   <p>9th stanza , “ Awaits alike . ” Probably this is also the reading of the Wrightson MS. Mitford gives it as noted by Mason , and it is retained by Gray in the ed . of 1768 .</p>

   <p>The 27th stanza has “ would he rove . ” We suspect that this is also the reading of the Wrightson MS ., as Mitford says it is noted by Mason .</p>

   <p>Some of the peculiarities of spelling in this MS. are the following : “ Curfeu ; ” “ Plowman ; ” “ Tinkleings ; ” “ mopeing ; ” “ ecchoing ; ” “ Huswife ; ” “ Ile ” ( aisle ) ; “ wast ” ( waste ) ; “ village-Hambden ; ” “ Rhimes ; ” “ spell't ; ” “ chearful ; ” “ born ” ( borne ) ; etc .</p>
   <p>Mitford , in his Life of Gray prefixed to the “ Eton ” edition of his Poems ( edited by Rev . John Moultrie , 1847 ) , says : “ I possess many curious variations from the printed text , taken from a copy of it in his own handwriting . ” He adds specimens of these variations , a few of which differ from both the Wrightson and Pembroke MSS . We give these in our notes below . See on 12 , 24 , and 93 .</p>
   <p>Several localities have contended for the honor of being the scene of the Elegy , but the general sentiment has always , and justly , been in favor of Stoke-Pogis . It was there that Gray began the poem in 1742 ; and there , as we have seen , he finished it in 1750 . In that churchyard his mother was buried , and there , at his request , his own remains were afterwards laid beside her . The scene is , moreover , in all respects in perfect keeping with the spirit of the poem .</p>
   <p>According to the common Cambridge tradition , Granchester , a parish about two miles southwest of the University , to which Gray was in the habit of taking his “ constitutional ” daily , is the locality of the poem ; and the great bell of St. Mary 's is the “ curfew ” of the first stanza . Another tradition makes a similar claim for Madingley , some three miles and a half northwest of Cambridge . Both places have churchyards such as the Elegy describes ; and this is about all that can be said in favor of their pretensions . There is also a parish called Burnham Beeches , in Buckinghamshire , which one writer at least has suggested as the scene of the poem , but for no better reason than that Gray once wrote a description of the place to Walpole , and casually mentioned the existence of certain “ beeches , ” at the foot of which he would “ squat , ” and “ there grow to the trunk a whole morning . ” Gray 's uncle had a seat in the neighborhood , and the poet often visited here , but the spot was not hallowed to him by the fond and tender associations that gathered about Stoke .</p>
   <p>1 . The curfew . Hales remarks : “ It is a great mistake to suppose that the ringing of the curfew was , at its institution , a mark of Norman oppression . If such a custom was unknown before the Conquest , it only shows that the old English police was less well-regulated than that of many parts of the Continent , and how much the superior civilization of the Norman-French was needed . Fires were the curse of the timber-built towns of the Middle Ages : ‘ Solae pestes Londoniae sunt stultorum immodica potatio et frequens incendium ’ ( Fitzstephen ) . The enforced extinction of domestic lights at an appointed signal was designed to be a safeguard against them . ”</p>
   <p>Warton wanted to have this line read</p>
   <p>“ The curfew tolls !— the knell of parting day . ”</p>
   <p>It is sufficient to say that Gray , as the manuscript shows , did not want it to read so , and that we much prefer his way to Warton 's .</p>
   <p>Mitford says that toll is “ not the appropriate verb , ” as the curfew was rung , not tolled . We presume that depended , to some extent , on the fancy of the ringer . Milton ( Il Pens . 76 ) speaks of the curfew as</p>
   <p>“ Swinging slow with sullen roar . ”</p>
   <p>Gray himself quotes here Dante , Purgat . 8 :</p>
   <p>— “ squilla di lontano Che paia ‘ l giorno pianger , che si muore ; ”</p>
   <p>and we cannot refrain from adding , for the benefit of those unfamiliar with Italian , Longfellow 's exquisite translation :</p>
   <p>— “ from far away a bell That seemeth to deplore the dying day . ”</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ That tolls the knell for their departed sense . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>On parting = departing , cf . Shakes . Cor . v. 6 : “ When I parted hence ; ” Goldsmith , D. V. 171 : “ Beside the bed where parting life was laid , ” etc .</p>
   <p>2 . The lowing herd wind , etc . Wind , and not winds , is the reading of the MS. ( see fac-simile of this stanza on p. 73 ) and of all the early editions — that of 1768 , Mason 's , Wakefield 's , Mathias 's , etc .— but we find no note of the fact in Mitford 's or any other of the more recent editions , which have substituted winds . Whether the change was made as an amendment or accidentally , we do not know ;<span corresp="#note10" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>but the original reading seems to us by far the better one . The poet does not refer to the herd as an aggregate , but to the animals that compose it . He sees , not it , but “ them on their winding way . ” The ordinary reading mars both the meaning and the melody of the line .</p>
   <note xml:id="note10" place="bottom" n="10">Very likely the latter , as we have seen that winds appears in the unauthorized version of the London Magazine ( March , 1751 ) , where it may be a misprint , like the others noted above .</note>
   <p>We may remark here that the edition of 1768 — the editio princeps of the collected Poems — was issued under Gray 's own supervision , and is printed with remarkable accuracy . We have detected only one indubitable error of the type in the entire volume . Certain peculiarities of spelling were probably intentional , as we find the like in the fac-similes of the poet 's manuscripts . The many quotations from Greek , Latin , and Italian are correctly given ( according to the received texts of the time ) , and the references to authorities , so far as we have verified them , are equally exact . The book throughout bears the marks of Gray 's scholarly and critical habits , and we may be sure that the poems appear in precisely the form which he meant they should retain . In doubtful cases , therefore , we have generally followed this edition . Mason 's ( the second edition : York , 1778 ) is also carefully edited and printed , and its readings seldom vary from Gray 's . All of Mitford 's that we have examined swarm with errors , especially in the notes . Pickering 's ( 1835 ) , edited by Mitford , is perhaps the worst of all . The Boston ed . ( Little , Brown , &amp; Co ., 1853 ) is a pretty careful reproduction of Pickering 's , with all its inaccuracies . ]</p>
   <p>3 . The critic of the N. A . Review points out that this line “ is quite peculiar in its possible transformations . We have made , ” he adds , “ twenty different versions preserving the rhythm , the general sentiment and the rhyming word . Any one of these variations might be , not inappropriately , substituted for the original reading . ”</p>

   <p>13 . “ As he stands in the churchyard , he thinks only of the poorer people , because the better-to-do lay interred inside the church . Tennyson ( In Mem . x . ) speaks of resting</p>
   <p>‘ beneath the clover sod That takes the sunshine and the rains , Or where the kneeling hamlet drains The chalice of the grapes of God . ’</p>
   <p>In Gray 's time , and long before , and some time after it , the former resting-place was for the poor , the latter for the rich . It was so in the first instance , for two reasons : ( i . ) the interior of the church was regarded as of great sanctity , and all who could sought a place in it , the most dearly coveted spot being near the high altar ; ( ii . ) when elaborate tombs were the fashion , they were built inside the church for the sake of security , ‘ gay tombs ’ being liable to be ‘ robb 'd ’ ( see the funeral dirge in Webster 's White Devil ) . As these two considerations gradually ceased to have power , and other considerations of an opposite tendency began to prevail , the inside of the church became comparatively deserted , except when ancestral reasons gave no choice ” ( Hales ) .</p>

   <p>20 . Their lowly bed . Wakefield remarks : “ Some readers , keeping in mind the ‘ narrow cell ’ above , have mistaken the ‘ lowly bed ’ in this verse for the grave — a most puerile and ridiculous blunder ; ” and Mitford says : “ Here the epithet ‘ lowly , ’ as applied to ‘ bed , ’ occasions some ambiguity as to whether the poet meant the bed on which they sleep , or the grave in which they are laid , which in poetry is called a ‘ lowly bed . ’ Of course the former is designed ; but Mr. Lloyd , in his Latin translation , mistook it for the latter . ”</p>

   <p>36 . Hayley , in the Life of Crashaw , Biographia Britannica , says that this line is “ literally translated from the Latin prose of Bartholinus in his Danish Antiquities . ”</p>
   <p>39 . Fretted . The fret is , strictly , an ornament used in classical architecture , formed by small fillets intersecting each other at right angles . Parker ( Glossary of Architecture ) derives the word from the Latin fretum , a strait ; and Hales from ferrum , iron , through the Italian ferrata , an iron grating . It is more likely ( see Stratmann and Wb . ) from the A. S. frætu , an ornament .</p>
   <p>Cf . Hamlet , ii . 2 :</p>
   <p>“ This majestical roof fretted with golden fire ; ”</p>

   <p>43 . Provoke . Mitford considers this use of the word “ unusually bold , to say the least . ” It is simply the etymological meaning , to call forth ( Latin , provocare ) . See Wb . Cf . Pope , Ode :</p>

   <p>57 . It was in 1636 that John Hampden , of Buckinghamshire ( a cousin of Oliver Cromwell ) , refused to pay the ship-money tax which Charles I. was levying without the authority of Parliament .</p>
   <p>58 . Little tyrant . Cf . Thomson , Winter :</p>
   <p>“ With open freedom little tyrants raged . ”</p>
   <p>The artists who have illustrated this passage ( see , for instance , Favourite English Poems , p. 305 , and Harper 's Monthly , vol . vii . p. 3 ) appear to understand “ little ” as equivalent to juvenile . If that had been the meaning , the poet would have used some other phrase than “ of his fields , ” or “ his lands , ” as he first wrote it .</p>
   <p>59 . Some mute inglorious Milton . Cf . Phillips , preface to Theatrum Poetarum : “ Even the very names of some who having perhaps been comparable to Homer for heroic poesy , or to Euripides for tragedy , yet nevertheless sleep inglorious in the crowd of the forgotten vulgar . ”</p>
   <p>60 . Some Cromwell , etc . Hales remarks : “ The prejudice against Cromwell was extremely strong throughout the 18th century , even amongst the more liberal-minded . That cloud of ‘ detractions rude , ’ of which Milton speaks in his noble sonnet to our ‘ chief of men ’ as in his own day enveloping the great republican leader , still lay thick and heavy over him . His wise statesmanship , his unceasing earnestness , his high-minded purpose , were not yet seen . ”</p>

   <p>Mitford points out “ the ambiguity of this couplet , which indeed gives a sense exactly contrary to that intended ; to avoid which one must break the grammatical construction . ” The poet 's meaning is , however , clear enough .</p>
   <p>75 . Wakefield quotes Pope , Epitaph on Fenton :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Foe to loud praise , and friend to learned ease ,</l>
     <l n="2">Content with science in the vale of peace . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>77 . These bones . “ The bones of these . So is is often used in Latin , especially by Livy , as in v. 22 : ‘ Ea sola pecunia , ’ the money derived from that sale , etc . ” ( Hales ) .</p>
   <p>84 . That teach . Mitford censures teach as ungrammatical ; but it may be justified as a “ construction according to sense . ”</p>
   <p>85 . Hales remarks : “ At the first glance it might seem that to dumb Forgetfulness a prey was in apposition to who , and the meaning was , ‘ Who that now lies forgotten , ’ etc . ; in which case the second line of the stanza must be closely connected with the fourth ; for the question of the passage is not ‘ Who ever died ? ’ but ‘ Who ever died without wishing to be remembered ? ’ But in this way of interpreting this difficult stanza ( i . ) there is comparatively little force in the appositional phrase , and ( ii . ) there is a certain awkwardness in deferring so long the clause ( virtually adverbal though apparently coördinate ) in which , as has just been noticed , the point of the question really lies . Perhaps therefore it is better to take the phrase to dumb Forgetfulness a prey as in fact the completion of the predicate resign 'd , and interpret thus : Who ever resigned this life of his with all its pleasures and all its pains to be utterly ignored and forgotten ?= who ever , when resigning it , reconciled himself to its being forgotten ? In this case the second half of the stanza echoes the thought of the first half . ”</p>
   <p>We give the note in full , and leave the reader to take his choice of the two interpretations . For ourself , we incline to the first rather than the second . We prefer to take to dumb Forgetfulness a prey as appositional and proleptic , and not as the grammatical complement of resigned : Who , yielding himself up a prey to dumb Forgetfulness , ever resigned this life without casting a longing , lingering look behind ?</p>
   <p>90 . Pious is used in the sense of the Latin pius . Ovid has “ piae lacrimae . ” Mitford quotes Pope , Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady , 49 :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ No friend 's complaint , no kind domestic tear</l>
     <l n="2">Pleas 'd thy pale ghost , or grac 'd thy mournful bier ;</l>
     <l n="3">By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos 'd . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ In this stanza , ” says Hales , “ he answers in an exquisite manner the two questions , or rather the one question twice repeated , of the preceding stanza .... What he would say is that every one while a spark of life yet remains in him yearns for some kindly loving remembrance ; nay , even after the spark is quenched , even when all is dust and ashes , that yearning must still be felt . ”</p>
   <p>91 , 92 . Mitford paraphrases the couplet thus : “ The voice of Nature still cries from the tomb in the language of the epitaph inscribed upon it , which still endeavours to connect us with the living ; the fires of former affection are still alive beneath our ashes . ”</p>
   <p>Cf . Chaucer , C. T. 3880 :</p>
   <p>“ Yet in our ashen cold is fire yreken . ”</p>

    </lg>

   <p>the “ these ” meaning his love and his songs concerning it . Gray translated this sonnet into Latin elegiacs , the last line being rendered ,</p>

   <p>In L'Allegro , 92 , we have “ upland hamlets , ” where Hales thinks “ upland = country , as opposed to town . ” He adds , “ Gray in his Elegy seems to use the word loosely for ‘ on the higher ground ; ’ perhaps he took it from Milton , without quite understanding in what sense Milton uses it . ” We doubt whether Hales understands Milton here . It is true that upland used to mean country , as uplanders meant countrymen , and uplandish countrified ( see Nares and Wb . ) , but the other meaning is older than Milton ( see Halliwell 's Dict . of Archaic Words ) , and Johnson , Keightley , and others are probably right in considering “ upland hamlets ” an instance of it . Masson , in his recent edition of Milton ( 1875 ) , explains the “ upland hamlets ” as “ little villages among the slopes , away from the river-meadows and the hay-making . ”</p>

   <p>Lucretius ( i . 291 ) has “ gremium matris terrai . ” Mitford adds the pathetic sentence of Pliny , Hist . Nat . ii . 63 : “ Nam terra novissime complexa gremio jam a reliqua natura abnegatos , tum maxime , ut mater , operit . ”</p>
   <p>123 . He gave to misery all he had , a tear . This is the pointing of the line in the MSS . and in all the early editions except that of Mathias , who seems to be responsible for the change ( adopted by the recent editors , almost without exception ) to ,</p>
   <p>“ He gave to Misery ( all he had ) a tear . ”</p>
   <p>This alters the meaning , mars the rhythm , and spoils the sentiment . If one does not see the difference at once , it would be useless to try to make him see it . Mitford , who ought to have known better , not only thrusts in the parenthesis , but quotes this from Pope 's Homer as an illustration of it :</p>
   <p>“ His fame ( ‘ tis all the dead can have ) shall live . ”</p>
   <p>126 . Mitford says that Or in this line should be Nor . Yes , if “ draw ” is an imperative , like “ seek ; ” no , if it is an infinitive , in the same construction as “ to disclose . ” That the latter was the construction the poet had in mind is evident from the form of the stanza in the Wrightson MS ., where “ seek ” is repeated :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ No farther seek his merits to disclose ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nor seek to draw them from their dread abode . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>127 . In trembling hope . Gray quotes Petrarch , Sonnet 104 : “ paventosa speme . ” Cf . Lucan , Pharsalia , vii . 297 : “ Spe trepido ; ” Mallet , Funeral Hymn , 473 :</p>
   <p>“ With trembling tenderness of hope and fear ; ”</p>
   <p>and Beaumont , Psyche , xv . 314 :</p>
   <p>“ Divided here twixt trembling hope and fear . ”</p>
   <p>Hooker ( Eccl . Pol . i . ) defines hope as “ a trembling expectation of things far removed . ”</p>

    <head>ODE ON THE SPRING .</head>
    <head>The original manuscript title of this ode was “ Noontide . ” It was first printed in Dodsley 's Collection , vol . ii . p. 271 , under the title of “ Ode . ”</head>

     <l n="1">1 . The rosy-bosom 'd Hours . Cf . Milton , Comus , 984 : “ The Graces</l>

   </lg>
   <p>The Horæ , or hours , according to the Homeric idea , were the goddesses of the seasons , the course of which was symbolically represented by “ the dance of the Hours . ” They were often described , in connection with the Graces , Hebe , and Aphrodite , as accompanying with their dancing the songs of the Muses and the lyre of Apollo . Long after the time of Homer they continued to be regarded as the givers of the seasons , especially spring and autumn , or “ Nature in her bloom and her maturity . ” At first there were only two Horæ , Thallo ( or Spring ) and Karpo ( or Autumn ) ; but later the number was three , like that of the Graces . In art they are represented as blooming maidens , bearing the products of the seasons .</p>
   <p>2 . Fair Venus ’ train . The Hours adorned Aphrodite ( Venus ) as she rose from the sea , and are often associated with her by Homer , Hesiod , and other classical writers . Wakefield remarks : “ Venus is here employed , in conformity to the mythology of the Greeks , as the source of creation and beauty . ”</p>
   <p>3 . Long-expecting . Waiting long for the spring . Sometimes incorrectly printed “ long-expected . ” Cf . Dryden , Astræa Redux , 132 : “ To flowers that in its womb expecting lie . ”</p>
   <p>4 . The purple year . Cf . the Pervigilium Veneris , 13 : “ Ipsa gemmis purpurantem pingit annum floribus ; ” Pope , Pastorals , i . 28 : “ And lavish Nature paints the purple year ; ” and Mallet , Zephyr : “ Gales that wake the purple year . ”</p>
   <p>5 . The Attic warbler . The nightingale , called “ the Attic bird , ” either because it was so common in Attica , or from the old legend that Philomela ( or , as some say , Procne ) , the daughter of a king of Attica , was changed into a nightingale . Cf . Milton 's description of Athens ( P. R. iv . 245 ):</p>
   <p>“ where the Attic bird Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long . ”</p>
   <p>Cf . Ovid , Hal . 110 : “ Attica avis verna sub tempestate queratus ; ” and Propertius , ii . 16 , 6 : “ Attica volucris . ”</p>
   <p>Pours her throat is a metonymy . H. p. 85 . Cf . Pope , Essay on Man , iii . 33 : “ Is it for thee the linnet pours her throat ? ”</p>

   <p>According to Ruskin ( Modern Painters , vol . iii . p. 241 , Amer . ed . ) there is no brown in nature . After remarking that Dante “ does not acknowledge the existence of the colour of brown at all , ” he goes on to say : “ But one day , just when I was puzzling myself about this , I happened to be sitting by one of our best living modern colourists , watching him at his work , when he said , suddenly and by mere accident , after we had been talking about other things , ‘ Do you know I have found that there is no brown in nature ? What we call brown is always a variety either of orange or purple . It never can be represented by umber , unless altered by contrast . ’ It is curious how far the significance of this remark extends , how exquisitely it illustrates and confirms the mediæval sense of hue , ” etc .</p>
   <p>14 . O'ercanopies the glade . Gray himself quotes Shakes . M. N. D. ii . 1 : “ A bank o'ercanopied with luscious woodbine . "[ 1 ] Cf . Fletcher , Purple Island , i . 5 , 30 : “ The beech shall yield a cool , safe canopy ; ” and Milton , Comus , 543 : “ a bank , With ivy canopied . ”</p>

   <p>24 . The busy murmur . Cf . Milton , P. R. iv . 248 : “ bees ’ industrious murmur . ”</p>
   <p>25 . The insect youth . Perhaps suggested by a line in Green 's Hermitage , quoted in a letter of Gray to Walpole : “ From maggot-youth through change of state , ” etc . See on 31 below .</p>
   <p>26 . The honied spring . Cf . Milton , Il Pens . 142 : “ the bee with honied thigh ; ” and Lyc . 140 : “ the honied showers . ”</p>
   <p>“ There has of late arisen , ” says Johnson in his Life of Gray , “ a practice of giving to adjectives derived from substantives the termination of participles , such as the cultured plain , the daisied bank ; but I am sorry to see in the lines of a scholar like Gray the honied spring . ” But , as we have seen , honied is found in Milton ; and Shakespeare also uses it in Hen . V. i . 1 : “ honey 'd sentences . ” Mellitus is used by Cicero , Horace , and Catullus . The editor of an English dictionary , as Lord Grenville has remarked , ought to know “ that the ready conversion of our substances into verbs , participles , and participial adjectives is of the very essence of our tongue , derived from its Saxon origin , and a main source of its energy and richness . ”</p>
   <p>27 . The liquid noon . Gray quotes Virgil , Geo . iv . 59 : “ Nare per aestatem liquidam . ”</p>
   <p>30 . Quick-glancing to the sun . Gray quotes Milton , P. L. vii . 405 :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sporting with quick glance ,</l>
     <l n="2">Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>31 . Gray here quotes Green , Grotto : “ While insects from the threshold preach . ” In a letter to Walpole , he says : “ I send you a bit of a thing for two reasons : first , because it is of one of your favourites , Mr. M. Green ; and next , because I would do justice . The thought on which my second Ode turns [ this Ode , afterwards placed first by Gray ] is manifestly stole from hence ; not that I knew it at the time , but having seen this many years before , to be sure it imprinted itself on my memory , and , forgetting the Author , I took it for my own . ” Then comes the quotation from Green 's Grotto . The passage referring to the insects is as follows :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ To the mind 's ear , and inward sight ,</l>
     <l n="2">There silence speaks , and shade gives light :</l>

   <p>ODE ON THE DEATH OF A FAVOURITE CAT .</p>
   <p>This ode first appeared in Dodsley 's Collection , vol . ii . p. 274 , with some variations noticed below . Walpole , after the death of Gray , placed the china vase on a pedestal at Strawberry Hill , with a few lines of the ode for an inscription .</p>
   <p>In a letter to Walpole , dated March 1 , 1747 , Gray refers to the subject of the ode in the following jocose strain : “ As one ought to be particularly careful to avoid blunders in a compliment of condolence , it would be a sensible satisfaction to me ( before I testify my sorrow , and the sincere part I take in your misfortune ) to know for certain who it is I lament . I knew Zara and Selima ( Selima , was it ? or Fatima ? ) , or rather I knew them both together ; for I cannot justly say which was which . Then as to your handsome Cat , the name you distinguish her by , I am no less at a loss , as well knowing one 's handsome cat is always the cat one likes best ; or if one be alive and the other dead , it is usually the latter that is the handsomest . Besides , if the point were never so clear , I hope you do not think me so ill-bred or so imprudent as to forfeit all my interest in the survivor ; oh no ! I would rather seem to mistake , and imagine to be sure it must be the tabby one that had met with this sad accident . Till this affair is a little better determined , you will excuse me if I do not begin to cry ,</p>
   <p>Tempus inane peto , requiem spatiumque doloris .</p>
   <p>“ ... Heigh ho ! I feel ( as you to be sure have done long since ) that I have very little to say , at least in prose . Somebody will be the better for it ; I do not mean you , but your Cat , feuë Mademoiselle Selime , whom I am about to immortalize for one week or fortnight , as follows : [ the Ode follows , which we need not reprint here ] .</p>
   <p>“ There 's a poem for you , it is rather too long for an Epitaph . ”</p>

     <l n="2">With antic shapes in China 's azure dyed . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>3 . The azure flowers that blow . Johnson and Wakefield find fault with this as redundant , but it is no more so than poetic usage allows . In the Progress of Poesy , i . 1 , we have again : “ The laughing flowers that round them blow . ” Cf . Comus , 992 :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Iris there with humid bow</l>
     <l n="2">Waters the odorous banks that blow</l>
     <l n="3">Flowers of more mingled hue</l>

   <p>ODE ON A DISTANT PROSPECT OF ETON COLLEGE .</p>
   <p>This , as Mason informs us , was the first English<span corresp="#note1_4" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>production of Gray 's that appeared in print . It was published , in folio , in 1747 ; and appeared again in Dodsley 's Collection , vol . ii . p. 267 , without the name of the author .</p>
   <note xml:id="note1_5" place="bottom" n="1">A Latin poem by him , a “ Hymeneal ” on the Prince of Wales 's Marriage , had appeared in the Cambridge Collection in 1736 .</note>
   <p>Hazlitt ( Lectures on English Poets ) says of this Ode : “ It is more mechanical and commonplace [ than the Elegy ] ; but it touches on certain strings about the heart , that vibrate in unison with it to our latest breath . No one ever passes by Windsor 's ‘ stately heights , ’ or sees the distant spires of Eton College below , without thinking of Gray . He deserves that we should think of him ; for he thought of others , and turned a trembling , ever-watchful ear to ‘ the still sad music of humanity . ’ ”</p>
   <p>The writer in the North American Review ( vol . xcvi . ) , after referring to the publication of this Ode , which , “ according to the custom of the time , was judiciously swathed in folio , ” adds :</p>
   <p>“ About this time Gray 's portrait was painted , at Walpole 's request ; and on the paper which he is represented as holding , Walpole wrote the title of the Ode , with a line from Lucan :</p>
   <p>‘ Nec licuit populis parvum te , Nile , videre . ’</p>
   <p>The poem met with very little attention until it was republished in 1751 , with a few other of his Odes . Gray , in speaking of it to Walpole , in connection with the Ode to Spring , merely says that to him ‘ the latter seems not worse than the former . ’ But the former has always been the greater favourite — perhaps more from the matter than the manner . It is the expression of the memories , the thoughts , and the feelings which arise unbidden in the mind of the man as he looks once more on the scenes of his boyhood . He feels a new youth in the presence of those old joys . But the old friends are not there . Generations have come and gone , and an unknown race now frolic in boyish glee . His sad , prophetic eye cannot help looking into the future , and comparing these careless joys with the inevitable ills of life . Already he sees the fury passions in wait for their little victims . They seem present to him , like very demons . Our language contains no finer , more graphic personifications than these almost tangible shapes . Spenser is more circumstantial , Collins more vehement , but neither is more real . Though but outlines in miniature , they are as distinct as Dutch art . Every epithet is a lifelike picture ; not a word could be changed without destroying the tone of the whole . At last the musing poet asks himself , Cui bono ? Why thus borrow trouble from the future ? Why summon so soon the coming locusts , to poison before their time the glad waters of youth ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Yet ah ! why should they know their fate ,</l>
     <l n="2">Since sorrow never comes too late .</l>
     <l n="3">And happiness too quickly flies ?</l>
     <l n="4">Thought would destroy their paradise .</l>
     <l n="5">No more ;— where ignorance is bliss ,</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Tis folly to be wise . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>So feeling and the want of feeling come together for once in the moral . The gay Roman satirist — the apostle of indifferentism — reaches the same goal , though he has travelled a different road . To Thaliarchus he says :</p>

   <p>In Anglo-Saxon and Early English prepositions were often placed after their objects . In the Elizabethan period the transposition of the weaker prepositions was not allowed , except in the compounds whereto , herewith , etc . ( cf . the Latin quocum , secum ) , but the longer forms were still , though rarely , transposed ( see Shakes . Gr . 203 ) ; and in more recent writers this latter license is extremely rare . Even the use of the preposition after the relative , which was very common in Shakespeare 's day , is now avoided , except in colloquial style .</p>

   <p>12 . Ah , fields belov 'd in vain ! Mitford remarks that this expression has been considered obscure , and adds the following explanation : “ The poem is written in the character of one who contemplates this life as a scene of misfortune and sorrow , from whose fatal power the brief sunshine of youth is supposed to be exempt . The fields are beloved as the scene of youthful pleasures , and as affording the promise of happiness to come ; but this promise never was fulfilled . Fate , which dooms man to misery , soon overclouded these opening prospects of delight . That is in vain beloved which does not realize the expectations it held out . No fruit but that of disappointment has followed the blossoms of a thoughtless hope . ”</p>

   <p>THE PROGRESS OF POESY .</p>
   <p>This Ode , as we learn from one of Gray 's letters to Walpole , was finished , with the exception of a few lines , in 1755 . It was not published until 1757 , when it appeared with The Bard in a quarto volume , which was the first issue of Walpole 's press at Strawberry Hill . In one of his letters Walpole writes : “ I send you two copies of a very honourable opening of my press — two amazing odes of Mr. Gray . They are Greek , they are Pindaric , they are sublime , consequently I fear a little obscure ; the second particularly , by the confinement of the measure and the nature of prophetic vision , is mysterious . I could not persuade him to add more notes . ” In another letter Walpole says : “ I found Gray in town last week ; he had brought his two odes to be printed . I snatched them out of Dodsley 's hands , and they are to be the first-fruits of my press . ” The title-page of the volume is as follows :</p>
   <p>ODES BY MR. GRAY . [ Greek : PHÔNANTA SUNETOISI ] — PINDAR , Olymp , II . PRINTED AT STRAWBERRY-HILL , for R. and J. DODSLEY in Pall-Mall . MDCCLVII .</p>
   <p>Both Odes were coldly received at first . “ Even my friends , ” writes Gray , in a letter to Hurd , Aug. 25 , 1757 , “ tell me they do not succeed , and write me moving topics of consolation on that head . In short , I have heard of nobody but an Actor [ Garrick ] and a Doctor of Divinity [ Warburton ] that profess their esteem for them . Oh yes , a Lady of quality ( a friend of Mason 's ) who is a great reader . She knew there was a compliment to Dryden , but never suspected there was anything said about Shakespeare or Milton , till it was explained to her , and wishes that there had been titles prefixed to tell what they were about . "[ 1 ] In a letter to Dr. Wharton , dated Aug. 17 , 1757 , he says : “ I hear we are not at all popular . The great objection is obscurity , nobody knows what we would be at . One man ( a Peer ) I have been told of , that thinks the last stanza of the 2d Ode relates to Charles the First and Oliver Cromwell ; in short , the [ Greek : Sunetoi ] appear to be still fewer than even I expected . ” A writer in the Critical Review thought that “ Æolian lyre ” meant the Æolian harp . Coleman the elder and Robert Lloyd wrote parodies entitled Odes to Obscurity and Oblivion . Gray finally had to add explanatory notes , though he intimates that his readers ought not to have needed them .<span corresp="#note2_3" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></p>
   <note xml:id="note1_6" place="bottom" n="1">Forster remarks that Gray might have added to the admirers of the Odes “ the poor monthly critic of The Dunciad ” — Oliver Goldsmith , then beginning his London career as a bookseller 's hack . In a review of the Odes in the London Monthly Review for Sept ., 1757 , after citing certain passages of The Bard , he says that they “ will give as much pleasure to those who relish this species of composition as anything that has hitherto appeared in our language , the odes of Dryden himself not excepted . ”</note>
   <note xml:id="note2_4" place="bottom" n="2">In a foot-note he says : “ When the author first published this and the following Ode , he was advised , even by his friends , to subjoin some few explanatory notes ; but had too much respect for the understanding of his readers to take that liberty . ”</note>
   <p>In a letter to Beattie , dated Feb. 1 , 1768 , referring to the new edition of his poems , he says : “ As to the notes , I do it out of spite , because the public did not understand the two Odes ( which I have called Pindaric ) , though the first was not very dark , and the second alluded to a few common facts to be found in any sixpenny history of England , by way of question and answer , for the use of children . ” And in a letter to Walpole , Feb. 25 , 1768 , he says he has added “ certain little Notes , partly from justice ( to acknowledge the debt where I had borrowed anything ) , partly from ill temper , just to tell the gentle reader that Edward I. was not Oliver Cromwell , nor Queen Elizabeth the Witch of Endor . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Fox , afterwards Lord Holland , said that “ if the Bard recited his Ode only once to Edward , he was sure he could not understand it . ” When this was told to Gray , he said , “ If he had recited it twenty times , Edward would not have been a bit wiser ; but that was no reason why Mr. Fox should not . ” ]</p>
   <p>“ The metre of these Odes is constructed on Greek models . It is not uniform but symmetrical . The nine stanzas of each ode form three groups . A slight examination will show that the 1st , 4th , and 7th stanzas are exactly inter-correspondent ; so the 2d , 5th , and 8th ; and so the remaining three . The technical Greek names for these three parts were [ Greek : strophê ] ( strophe ) , [ Greek : antistrophê ] ( antistrophe ) , and [ Greek : epôdos ] ( epodos ) — the Turn , the Counter-turn , and the After-song — names derived from the theatre ; the Turn denoting the movement of the Chorus from one side of the [ Greek : orchêstra ] ( orchestra ) , or Dance-stage , to the other , the Counter-turn the reverse movement , the After-song something sung after two such movements . Odes thus constructed were called by the Greeks Epodic . Congreve is said to have been the first who so constructed English odes . This system cannot be said to have prospered with us . Perhaps no English ear would instinctively recognize that correspondence between distant parts which is the secret of it . Certainly very many readers of The Progress of Poesy are wholly unconscious of any such harmony ” ( Hales ) .</p>

   <p>1 . Awake , Æolian lyre . The blunder of the Critical Reviewers who supposed the “ harp of Æolus ” to be meant led Gray to insert this note : “ Pindar styles his own poetry with its musical accompaniments , [ Greek : Aiolis molpê , Aiolides chordai , Aiolidôn pnoai aulôn ] , Æolian song , Æolian strings , the breath of the Æolian flute . ”</p>
   <p>Cf . Cowley , Ode of David : “ Awake , awake , my lyre ! ” Gray himself quotes Ps . lvii . 8 . The first reading of the line in the MS. was , “ Awake , my lyre : my glory , wake . ” Gray also adds the following note : “ The subject and simile , as usual with Pindar , are united . The various sources of poetry , which gives life and lustre to all it touches , are here described ; its quiet majestic progress enriching every subject ( otherwise dry and barren ) with a pomp of diction and luxuriant harmony of numbers ; and its more rapid and irresistible course , when swollen and hurried away by the conflict of tumultuous passions . ”</p>
   <p>2 . And give to rapture . The first reading of the MS. was “ give to transport . ”</p>
   <p>3 . Helicon 's harmonious springs . In the mountain range of Helicon , in Boeotia , there were two fountains sacred to the Muses , Aganippe and Hippocrene , of which the former was the more famous .</p>

   <p>We append , as a curiosity of criticism , Dr. Johnson 's comments on this ode , from his Lives of the Poets . The Life of Gray has been called “ the worst in the series , ” and perhaps this is the worst part of it :[ 4 ]</p>
   <p>“ My process has now brought me to the wonderful ‘ Wonder of Wonders , ’ the two Sister Odes , by which , though either vulgar ignorance or common-sense at first universally rejected them , many have been since persuaded to think themselves delighted . I am one of those that are willing to be pleased , and therefore would gladly find the meaning of the first stanza of ‘ The Progress of Poetry . ’</p>
   <p>“ Gray seems in his rapture to confound the images of spreading sound and running water . A ‘ stream of music ’ may be allowed ; but where does ‘ music , ’ however ‘ smooth and strong , ’ after having visited the ‘ verdant vales , roll down the steep amain , ’ so as that ‘ rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar ? ’ If this be said of music , it is nonsense ; if it be said of water , it is nothing to the purpose .</p>
   <p>“ The second stanza , exhibiting Mars 's car and Jove 's eagle , is unworthy of further notice . Criticism disdains to chase a schoolboy to his commonplaces .</p>
   <p>“ To the third it may likewise be objected that it is drawn from mythology , though such as may be more easily assimilated to real life . Idalia 's ‘ velvet-green ’ has something of cant . An epithet or metaphor drawn from Nature ennobles Art ; an epithet or metaphor drawn from Art degrades Nature . Gray is too fond of words arbitrarily compounded . ‘ Many-twinkling ’ was formerly censured as not analogical ; we may say ‘ many-spotted , ’ but scarcely ‘ many-spotting . ’ This stanza , however , has something pleasing .</p>
   <p>“ Of the second ternary of stanzas , the first endeavours to tell something , and would have told it , had it not been crossed by Hyperion ; the second describes well enough the universal prevalence of poetry ; but I am afraid that the conclusion will not arise from the premises . The caverns of the North and the plains of Chili are not the residences of ‘ Glory and generous Shame . ’ But that Poetry and Virtue go always together is an opinion so pleasing that I can forgive him who resolves to think it true .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The third stanza sounds big with ‘ Delphi , ’ and ‘ Ægean , ’ and</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Ilissus , ’ and ‘ Mæander , ’ and with ‘ hallowed fountains , ’ and ‘ solemn</l>
     <l n="3">sound ; ’ but in all Gray 's odes there is a kind of cumbrous splendour</l>
     <l n="4">which we wish away . His position is at last false : in the time of</l>
     <l n="5">Dante and Petrarch , from whom we derive our first school of poetry ,</l>
     <l n="6">Italy was overrun by ‘ tyrant power ’ and ‘ coward vice ; ’ nor was our</l>
     <l n="7">state much better when we first borrowed the Italian arts .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Of the third ternary , the first gives a mythological birth of Shakespeare . What is said of that mighty genius is true ; but it is not said happily : the real effects of this poetical power are put out of sight by the pomp of machinery . Where truth is sufficient to fill the mind , fiction is worse than useless ; the counterfeit debases the genuine .</p>
   <p>“ His account of Milton 's blindness , if we suppose it caused by study in the formation of his poem , a supposition surely allowable , is poetically true and happily imagined . But the car of Dryden , with his two coursers , has nothing in it peculiar ; it is a car in which any other rider may be placed . ”</p>
   <note xml:id="note4_2" place="bottom" n="4">Sir James Mackintosh well says of Johnson 's criticisms : “ Wherever understanding alone is sufficient for poetical criticism , the decisions of Johnson are generally right . But the beauties of poetry must be felt before their causes are investigated . There is a poetical sensibility , which in the progress of the mind becomes as distinct a power as a musical ear or a picturesque eye . Without a considerable degree of this sensibility , it is as vain for a man of the greatest understanding to speak of the higher beauties of poetry as it is for a blind man to speak of colours . To adopt the warmest sentiments of poetry , to realize its boldest imagery , to yield to every impulse of enthusiasm , to submit to the illusions of fancy , to retire with the poet into his ideal worlds , were dispositions wholly foreign from the worldly sagacity and stern shrewdness of Johnson . As in his judgment of life and character , so in his criticism on poetry , he was a sort of Free-thinker . He suspected the refined of affectation , he rejected the enthusiastic as absurd , and he took it for granted that the mysterious was unintelligible . He came into the world when the school of Dryden and Pope gave the law to English poetry . In that school he had himself learned to be a lofty and vigorous declaimer in harmonious verse ; beyond that school his unforced admiration perhaps scarcely soared ; and his highest effort of criticism was accordingly the noble panegyric on Dryden . ”</note>
   <p>W. H. Prescott , the historian , also remarks that Johnson , as a critic , “ was certainly deficient in sensibility to the more delicate , the minor beauties of poetic sentiment . He analyzes verse in the cold-blooded spirit of a chemist , until all the aroma which constituted its principal charm escapes in the decomposition . By this kind of process , some of the finest fancies of the Muse , the lofty dithyrambics of Gray , the ethereal effusions of Collins , and of Milton too , are rendered sufficiently vapid . ” ]</p>

   <p>THE BARD .</p>
   <p>“ This ode is founded on a tradition current in Wales that Edward the First , when he completed the conquest of that country , ordered all the bards that fell into his hands to be put to death ” ( Gray ) .</p>
   <p>The original argument of the ode , as Gray had set it down in his commonplace-book , was as follows : “ The army of Edward I ., as they march through a deep valley , and approach Mount Snowdon , are suddenly stopped by the appearance of a venerable figure seated on the summit of an inaccessible rock , who , with a voice more than human , reproaches the king with all the desolation and misery which he had brought on his country ; foretells the misfortunes of the Norman race , and with prophetic spirit declares that all his cruelty shall never extinguish the noble ardour of poetic genius in this island ; and that men shall never be wanting to celebrate true virtue and valour in immortal strains , to expose vice and infamous pleasure , and boldly censure tyranny and oppression . His song ended , he precipitates himself from the mountain , and is swallowed up by the river that rolls at its feet . ”</p>
   <p>Mitford , in his “ Essay on the Poetry of Gray , ” says of this Ode : “ The tendency of The Bard is to show the retributive justice that follows an act of tyranny and wickedness ; to denounce on Edward , in his person and his progeny , the effect of the crime he had committed in the massacre of the bards ; to convince him that neither his power nor situation could save him from the natural and necessary consequences of his guilt ; that not even the virtues which he possessed could atone for the vices with which they were accompanied :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Helm nor hauberk 's twisted mail ,</l>
     <l n="2">Nor e'en thy virtues , tyrant , shall avail . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is the real tendency of the poem ; and well worthy it was of being adorned and heightened by such a profusion of splendid images and beautiful machinery . We must also observe how much this moral feeling increases as we approach the close ; how the poem rises in dignity ; and by what a fine gradation the solemnity of the subject ascends . The Bard commenced his song with feelings of sorrow for his departed brethren and his desolate country . This despondence , however , has given way to emotions of a nobler and more exalted nature . What can be more magnificent than the vision which opens before him to display the triumph of justice and the final glory of his cause ? And it may be added , what can be more forcible or emphatic than the language in which it is conveyed ?</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ But oh ! what solemn scenes on Snowdon 's height ,</l>
     <l n="2">Descending slow their glittering skirts unroll ?</l>
     <l n="3">Visions of glory , spare my aching sight !</l>
     <l n="4">Ye unborn ages , crowd not on my soul ! ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The fine apostrophe to the shade of Taliessin completes the picture</l>
     <l n="6">of exultation :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="7">‘ Hear from the grave , great Taliessin , hear ;</l>
     <l n="8">They breathe a soul to animate thy clay . ’</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The triumph of justice , therefore , is now complete . The vanquished has risen superior to his conqueror , and the reader closes the poem with feelings of content and satisfaction . He has seen the Bard uplifted both by a divine energy and by the natural superiority of virtue ; and the conqueror has shrunk into a creature of hatred and abhorrence :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Be thine despair , and sceptred care ;</l>
     <l n="2">To triumph , and to die , are mine . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With regard to the obscurity of the poem , the same writer remarks that “ it is such only as of necessity arises from the plan and conduct of a prophecy . ” “ In the prophetic poem , ” he adds , “ one point of history alone is told , and the rest is to be acquired previously by the reader ; as in the contemplation of an historical picture , which commands only one moment of time , our memory must supply us with the necessary links of knowledge ; and that point of time selected by the painter must be illustrated by the spectator 's knowledge of the past or future , of the cause or the consequences . ”</p>
   <p>He refers , for corroboration of this opinion , to Dr. Campbell , who in his “ Philosophy of Rhetoric , ” says : “ I know no style to which darkness of a certain sort is more suited than to the prophetical : many reasons might be assigned which render it improper that prophecy should be perfectly understood before it be accomplished . Besides , we are certain that a prediction may be very dark before the accomplishment , and yet so plain afterwards as scarcely to admit a doubt in regard to the events suggested . It does not belong to critics to give laws to prophets , nor does it fall within the confines of any human art to lay down rules for a species of composition so far above art . Thus far , however , we may warrantably observe , that when the prophetic style is imitated in poetry , the piece ought , as much as possible , to possess the character above mentioned . This character , in my opinion , is possessed in a very eminent degree by Mr. Gray 's ode called The Bard . It is all darkness to one who knows nothing of the English history posterior to the reign of Edward the First , and all light to one who is acquainted with that history . But this is a kind of writing whose peculiarities can scarcely be considered as exceptions from ordinary rules . ”</p>
   <p>Farther on in the same essay , Mitford remarks : “ The skill of Gray is , I think , eminently shown in the superior distinctness with which he has marked those parts of his prophecies which are speedily to be accomplished ; and in the gradations by which , as he descends , he has insensibly melted the more remote into the deeper and deeper shadowings of general language . The first prophecy is the fate of Edward the Second . In that the Bard has pointed out the very night in which he is to be destroyed ; has named the river that flowed around his prison , and the castle that was the scene of his sufferings :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Mark the year , and mark the night ,</l>
     <l n="2">When Severn shall re-echo with affright</l>
     <l n="3">The shrieks of death thro ’ Berkeley 's roofs that ring ,</l>
     <l n="4">Shrieks of an agonizing king . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How different is the imagery when Richard the Second is described ; and how indistinctly is the luxurious monarch marked out in the form of the morning , and his country in the figure of the vessel !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ The swarm that in thy noontide beam were born ?</l>
     <l n="2">Gone to salute the rising morn .</l>
     <l n="3">Fair laughs the morn , ’ etc .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The last prophecy is that of the civil wars , and of the death of the two young princes . No place , no name is now noted : and all is seen through the dimness of figurative expression :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Above , below , the rose of snow ,</l>
     <l n="2">Twin 'd with her blushing foe , we spread :</l>
     <l n="3">The bristled boar in infant gore</l>
     <l n="4">Wallows beneath the thorny shade . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Hales remarks : “ It is perhaps scarcely now necessary to say that the tradition on which The Bard is founded is wholly groundless . Edward I. never did massacre Welsh bards . Their name is legion in the beginning of the 14th century . Miss Williams , the latest historian of Wales , does not even mention the old story . "[ 1 ]</p>
   <note xml:id="note1_7" place="bottom" n="1">The Saturday Review , for June 19 , 1875 , in the article from which we have elsewhere quoted ( p. 79 , foot-note ) , refers to this point as follows :</note>
   <p>“ Gray was one of the first writers to show that earlier parts of English history were not only worth attending to , but were capable of poetic treatment . We can almost forgive him for dressing up in his splendid verse a foul and baseless calumny against Edward the First , when we remember that to most of Gray 's contemporaries Edward the First must have seemed a person almost mythical , a benighted Popish savage , of whom there was very little to know , and that little hardly worth knowing . Our feeling towards Gray in this matter is much the same as our feeling towards Mitford in the matter of Greek history . We are angry with Mitford for misrepresenting Demosthenes and a crowd of other Athenian worthies , but we do not forget that he was the first to deal with Demosthenes and his fellows , neither as mere names nor as demi-gods , but as real living men like ourselves . It was a pity to misrepresent Demosthenes , but even the misrepresentation was something ; it showed that Demosthenes could be made the subject of human feeling one way or another . It is unpleasant to hear the King whose praise it was that</p>
   <p>‘ Velox est ad veniam , ad vindictam tardus , ’</p>
   <p>spoken of as ‘ ruthless , ’ and the rest of it . But Gray at least felt that Edward was a real man , while to most of his contemporaries he could have been little more than ‘ the figure of an old Gothic king , ’ such as Sir Roger de Coverley looked when he sat in Edward 's own chair . ” ]</p>
   <p>1 . A good example of alliteration .</p>
   <p>2 . Cf . Shakes . K. John , iv . 2 : “ and vast confusion waits . ”</p>
   <p>4 . Gray quotes K. John , v. 1 : “ Mocking the air with colours idly spread . ”</p>
   <p>5 . “ The hauberk was a texture of steel ringlets , or rings interwoven , forming a coat of mail that sat close to the body , and adapted itself to every motion ” ( Gray ) .</p>
   <p>Cf . Robert of Gloucester : “ With helm and hauberk ; ” and Dryden , Pal . and Arc . iii . 603 : “ Hauberks and helms are hewed with many a wound . ”</p>
   <p>7 . Nightly . Nocturnal , as often in poetry . Cf . Il Pens . 84 , etc .</p>
   <p>9 . The crested pride . Gray quotes Dryden , Indian Queen : “ The crested adder 's pride . ”</p>
   <p>11 . “ Snowdon was a name given by the Saxons to that mountainous tract which the Welsh themselves call Craigian-eryri : it included all the highlands of Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire , as far east as the river Conway . R. Hygden , speaking of the castle of Conway , built by King Edward the First , says : ‘ Ad ortum amnis Conway ad clivum montis Erery ; ’ and Matthew of Westminster ( ad ann . 1283 ) , ‘ Apud Aberconway ad pedes montis Snowdoniae fecit erigi castrum forte ’ ” ( Gray ) .</p>
   <p>It was in the spring of 1283 that English troops at last forced their way among the defiles of Snowdon . Llewellyn had preserved those passes and heights intact until his death in the preceding December . The surrender of Dolbadern in the April following that dispiriting event opened a way for the invader ; and William de Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick , at once advanced by it ( Hales ) .</p>
   <p>The epithet shaggy is highly appropriate , as Leland ( Itin . ) says that great woods clothed the mountain in his time . Cf . Dyer , Ruins of Rome :</p>
   <p>“ as Britannia 's oaks On Merlin 's mount , or Snowdon 's rugged sides , Stand in the clouds . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">See also Lycidas , 54 : “ Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high ; ” and P .</l>
     <l n="2">L. vi . 645 : “ the shaggy tops . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>13 . Stout Gloster . “ Gilbert de Clare , surnamed the Red , Earl of Gloucester and Hereford , son-in-law to King Edward ” ( Gray ) . He had , in 1282 , conducted the war in South Wales ; and after overthrowing the enemy near Llandeilo Fawr , had reinforced the king in the northwest .</p>
   <p>14 . Mortimer . “ Edmond de Mortimer , Lord of Wigmore ” ( Gray ) . It was by one of his knights , named Adam de Francton , that Llewellyn , not at first known to be he , was slain near Pont Orewyn ( Hales ) .</p>
   <p>On quivering lance , cf . Virgil , Æn . xii . 94 : “ hastam quassatque trementem . ”</p>
   <p>15 . On a rock whose haughty brow . Cf . Daniel , Civil Wars : “ A huge aspiring rock , whose surly brow . ”</p>
   <p>The rock is probably meant for Penmaen-mawr , the northern termination of the Snowdon range . It is a mass of rock , 1545 feet high , a few miles from the mouth of the Conway , the valley of which it overlooks . Towards the sea it presents a rugged and almost perpendicular front . On its summit is Braich-y-Dinas , an ancient fortified post , regarded as the strongest hold of the Britons in the district of Snowdon . Here the reduced bands of the Welsh army were stationed during the negotiation between their prince Llewellyn and Edward I . Within the inner enclosure is a never-failing well of pure water . The rock is now pierced with a tunnel 1890 feet long for the Chester and Holyhead railway .</p>
   <p>17 . Rob 'd in the sable garb of woe . It would appear that Wharton had criticised this line , for in a letter to him , dated Aug. 21 , 1757 , Gray writes : “ You may alter that ‘ Robed in the sable , ’ etc ., almost in your own words , thus ,</p>

   <p>Though haggard , which conveys to you the idea of a witch , is indeed only a metaphor taken from an unreclaimed hawk , which is called a haggard , and looks wild and farouche , and jealous of its liberty . ” Gray seems to have afterwards returned to his first ( and we think better ) reading .</p>
   <p>19 . “ The image was taken from a well-known picture of Raphael , representing the Supreme Being in the vision of Ezekiel . There are two of these paintings ( both believed originals ) , one at Florence , the other in the Duke of Orleans 's collection at Paris ” ( Gray ) .</p>
   <p>20 . Like a meteor . Gray quotes P. L. i . 537 : “ Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind . ”</p>
   <p>21 , 22 . Wakefield remarks : “ This is poetical language in perfection ; and breathes the sublime spirit of Hebrew poetry , which delights in this grand rhetorical substitution . ”</p>
   <p>23 . Desert caves . Cf . Lycidas , 39 : “ The woods and desert caves . ”</p>
   <p>26 . Hoarser murmurs . That is , perhaps , with continually increasing hoarseness , hoarser and hoarser ; or it may mean with unwonted hoarseness , like the comparative sometimes in Latin ( Hales ) .</p>
   <p>28 . Hoel is called high-born , being the son of Owen Gwynedd , prince of North Wales , by Finnog , an Irish damsel . He was one of his father 's generals in his wars against the English , Flemings , and Normans , in South Wales ; and was a famous bard , as his poems that are extant testify .</p>
   <p>Soft Llewellyn 's lay . “ The lay celebrating the mild Llewellyn , ” says Hales , though he afterwards remarks that , “ looking at the context , it would be better to take Llewellyn here for a bard . ” Many bards celebrated the warlike prowess and princely qualities of Llewellyn . A poem by Einion the son of Guigan calls him “ a tender-hearted prince ; ” and another , by Llywarch Brydydd y Moch , says : “ Llewellyn , though in battle he killed with fury , though he burned like an outrageous fire , yet was a mild prince when the mead-horns were distributed . ” In an ode by Llygard Gwr he is also called “ Llewellyn the mild . ”</p>
   <p>29 . Cadwallo and Urien were bards of whose songs nothing has been preserved . Taliessin ( see 121 below ) dedicated many poems to the latter , and wrote an elegy on his death : he was slain by treachery in the year 560 .</p>
   <p>30 . That hush 'd the stormy main . Cf . Shakes . M. N. D. ii . 2 :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath ,</l>
     <l n="2">That the rude sea grew civil at her song . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>33 . Modred . This name is not found in the lists of the old bards . It may have been borrowed from the Arthurian legends ; or , as Mitford suggests , it may refer to “ the famous Myrddin ab Morvyn , called Merlyn the Wild , a disciple of Taliessin , the form of the name being changed for the sake of euphony . ”</p>
   <p>34 . Plinlimmon . One of the loftiest of the Welsh mountains , being 2463 feet in height . It is really a group of mountains , three of which tower high above the others , and on each of these is a carnedd , or pile of stones . The highest of the three is further divided into two peaks , and on these , as well as on another prominent part of the same height , are other piles of stones . These five piles , according to the common tradition , mark the graves of slain warriors , and serve as memorials of their exploits ; but some believe that they were intended as landmarks or military signals , and that from them the mountain was called Pump-lumon or Pum-lumon , “ the five beacons ” — a name somehow corrupted into Plinlimmon . Five rivers take their rise in the recesses of Plinlimmon — the Wye , the Severn , the Rheidol , the Llyfnant , and the Clywedog .</p>
   <p>35 . Arvon 's shore . “ The shores of Caernarvonshire , opposite the isle of Anglesey ” ( Gray ) . Caernarvon , or Caer yn Arvon , means the camp in Arvon .</p>
   <p>38 . “ Camden and others observe that eagles used annually to build their aerie among the rocks of Snowdon , which from thence ( as some think ) were named by the Welsh Craigian-eryri , or the crags of the eagles . At this day ( I am told ) the highest point of Snowdon is called the Eagle 's Nest . That bird is certainly no stranger to this island , as the Scots , and the people of Cumberland , Westmoreland , etc ., can testify ; it even has built its nest in the peak of Derbyshire [ see Willoughby 's Ornithology , published by Ray ] ” ( Gray ) .</p>

   <p>Berkeley Castle is on the southeast side of the town of Berkeley , on a height commanding a fine view of the Severn and the surrounding country , and is in a state of perfect preservation . It is said to have been founded by Roger de Berkeley soon after the Norman Conquest . About the year 1150 it was granted by Henry II . to Robert Fitzhardinge , Governor of Bristol , who strengthened and enlarged it . On the right of the great staircase leading to the keep , and approached by a gallery , is the room in which it is supposed that Edward II . was murdered , Sept. 21 , 1327 . The king , during his captivity here , composed a dolorous poem , of which the following is an extract :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Moste blessed Jesu ,</l>
     <l n="2">Roote of all vertue ,</l>
     <l n="3">Graunte I may the sue ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>Walpole , who visited the place in 1774 , says : “ The room shown for the murder of Edward II ., and the shrieks of an agonizing king , I verily believe to be genuine . It is a dismal chamber , almost at the top of the house , quite detached , and to be approached only by a kind of foot-bridge , and from that descends a large flight of steps , that terminates on strong gates ; exactly a situation for a corps de garde . ”</p>

     <l n="19">append his comments on this “ Sister Ode : ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ ‘ The Bard ’ appears , at the first view , to be , as Algarotti and others have remarked , an imitation of the prophecy of Nereus . Algarotti thinks it superior to its original ; and , if preference depends only on the imagery and animation of the two poems , his judgment is right . There is in ‘ The Bard ’ more force , more thought , and more variety . But to copy is less than to invent , and the copy has been unhappily produced at a wrong time . The fiction of Horace was to the Romans credible ; but its revival disgusts us with apparent and unconquerable falsehood . Incredulus odi .</p>
   <p>“ To select a singular event , and swell it to a giant 's bulk by fabulous appendages of spectres and predictions , has little difficulty ; for he that forsakes the probable may always find the marvellous . And it has little use ; we are affected only as we believe ; we are improved only as we find something to be imitated or declined . I do not see that ‘ The Bard ’ promotes any truth , moral or political .</p>
   <p>“ His stanzas are too long , especially his epodes ; the ode is finished before the ear has learned its measures , and consequently before it can receive pleasure from their consonance and recurrence .</p>
   <p>“ Of the first stanza the abrupt beginning has been celebrated ; but technical beauties can give praise only to the inventor . It is in the power of any man to rush abruptly upon his subject , that has read the ballad of ‘ Johnny Armstrong , ’</p>
   <p>‘ Is there ever a man in all Scotland — ’</p>
   <p>“ The initial resemblances , or alliterations , ‘ ruin , ruthless , helm or hauberk , ’ are below the grandeur of a poem that endeavours at sublimity .</p>
   <p>“ In the second stanza the Bard is well described ; but in the third we have the puerilities of obsolete mythology . When we are told that ‘ Cadwallo hush 'd the stormy main , ’ and that ‘ Modred made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-topt head , ’ attention recoils from the repetition of a tale that , even when it was first heard , was heard with scorn .</p>
   <p>“ The weaving of the winding-sheet he borrowed , as he owns , from the Northern Bards ; but their texture , however , was very properly the work of female powers , as the act of spinning the thread of life is another mythology . Theft is always dangerous ; Gray has made weavers of slaughtered bards by a fiction outrageous and incongruous . They are then called upon to ‘ Weave the warp , and weave the woof , ’ perhaps with no great propriety ; for it is by crossing the woof with the warp that men weave the web or piece ; and the first line was dearly bought by the admission of its wretched correspondent , ‘ Give ample room and verge enough . ’ He has , however , no other line as bad .</p>
   <p>“ The third stanza of the second ternary is commended , I think , beyond its merit . The personification is indistinct . Thirst and Hunger are not alike ; and their features , to make the imagery perfect , should have been discriminated . We are told , in the same stanza , how ‘ towers are fed . ’ But I will no longer look for particular faults ; yet let it be observed that the ode might have been concluded with an action of better example ; but suicide is always to be had , without expense of thought . ”</p>

    <head>APPENDIX TO NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">Just as this book is going to press we have received The Quarterly Review ( London ) for January , 1876 , which contains an interesting paper on “ Wordsworth and Gray . ” After quoting Wordsworth 's remark that “ Gray was at the head of those poets who , by their reasonings , have attempted to widen the space of separation between prose and metrical composition , and was , more than any other man , curiously elaborate in the construction of his own poetic diction , ” the reviewer remarks :</p>
    <p n="2">“ The indictment , then , brought by Wordsworth against Gray is twofold . Gray , it seems , had in the first place a false conception of the nature of poetry ; and , secondly , a false standard of poetical diction . To begin with the first count , Gray , we are told , sought to widen the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition . What this charge amounts to we shall see hereafter . Meantime , did Wordsworth think that between prose and poetry there was any line of demarcation at all ? In the Preface [ to the “ Lyrical Ballads ” ] from which we have quoted we read :</p>
    <p n="3">“ ‘ There neither is nor can be any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition . We are fond of tracing the resemblance between Poetry and Painting , and accordingly we call them sisters ; but where shall we find bonds of connection sufficiently strong to typify the connection betwixt prose and metrical composition ? ’</p>
    <p n="4">“ Now this question admits of a very definite answer . Take the Iliad of Homer and a proposition of Euclid . Is it conceivable that the latter could have been expressed at all in metre , or the former expressed half so well in prose ? If not , what is the reason ? Is it not plain that the poem contains a predominant element of imagination and feeling which is absolutely excluded from the proposition ? And in the same way it may be shown that whenever a man expresses himself properly in metre , the subject-matter of his composition belongs to imagination or feeling ; whenever he writes in prose his subject belongs to or ( if the prose be fiction ) intimately resembles matter of fact . We may decide then with certainty that the sphere of poetry lies in Imagination , and that the larger the amount of just liberty the Imagination enjoys , the better will be the poetry it produces . But then a further question arises , and this is the key of the whole position , How far does this liberty extend ? Is Imagination absolute , supreme , and uncontrolled in its own sphere , or is it under the guidance and government of reason ? That its dominion is not universal is obvious , but of its influence we are all conscious , and there is no exaggeration in the eloquent words of Pascal :</p>
    <p n="5">“ ‘ This mighty power , the perpetual antagonist of reason , which delights to show its ascendency by bringing her under its control and dominion , has created a second nature in man . It has its joys and its sorrows ; its health , its sickness ; its wealth , its poverty ; it compels reason , in spite of herself , to believe , to doubt , to deny ; it suspends the exercise of the senses , and imparts to them again an artificial acuteness ; it has its follies and its wisdom ; and the most perverse thing of all is that it fills its votaries with a complacency more full and complete even than that which reason can supply . ’</p>
    <p n="6">“ If such be the force of Imagination in active life , how absolute must be its dominion in poetry ! And absolute it is , if we are to believe Wordsworth , who defines poetry to be ‘ the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotion . ’ This definition coincides well with modern notions on the nature of the art . But how different is the view if we turn from theory to practice ! It would surely be a serious mistake to describe the noblest poems , like the ‘ Æneid ’ or ‘ Paradise Lost , ’ as the product of mere spontaneous emotion . And even in lyric verse , to which it may be said Wordsworth is specially alluding , we find the greatest poets , like Pindar and Simonides , composing their odes for set occasions like the public games , in honour of persons with whom they were but little acquainted , and ( most significant fact of all ) in the expectation of receiving liberal rewards . We need not say that such considerations detract nothing from the genius of these great poets ; but they prove very conclusively that poetry is not what Wordsworth 's definition asserts , and what in these days it is too often assumed to be , the mere gush of unconscious inspiration . The definition of Wordsworth may perhaps suit short lyrics , such as he was himself in the habit of composing , but it would be fatal to the claims of poetry to rank among the higher arts , for it would exclude that quality which , in poetry as in all art , is truly sovereign , Invention . The poet , no less than the mechanical inventor , excels by the exercise of reason , by his knowledge of the required effect , his power of adapting means to ends , and his skill in availing himself of circumstances . Consider for a moment the external difficulties which restrict the poet 's liberty , and require the most vigorous efforts of reason to subdue them . To begin with , in order to secure the happy result promised by Horace ,</p>

    <p n="8">he has to take the exact measure of his own powers . How many a poet has failed for want of judgment by trespassing on a subject and style for which his genius is unfitted ! Again , he is confronted by the most obvious difficulties of language and metre , which limit his freedom to a degree unknown to the prose-writer . And beyond this , if he wishes to be read — and a poem without readers is no more than a musical instrument without a musician — he has to consider the character of his audience . He must have all the instinct of an orator , all the intuitive knowledge of the world , as well as all the practical resource , which are required to gain command over the hearts of men , and to subdue , by the charms of eloquence , their passions , their prejudices , and their judgment . To achieve such results something more is required than ‘ the spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling . ’</p>
    <p n="9">“ How far Wordsworth 's own poetry illustrates his principles we shall consider presently ; meantime his definition helps us to understand what he meant by Gray 's fault of widening the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition . Neither in respect of the quantity nor the quality of his verse could Gray 's manner of composition be described as spontaneous . Compared with Wordsworth 's numerous volumes of poetry , the slender volume that contains the poetry of Gray looks meagre indeed ; yet almost every poem in this small collection is a considered work of art . To begin with ‘ The Bard . ’ Few readers , we suppose , would rise from this ode without a sense of its poetical ‘ effect . ’ The details may be thought to require too much attention ; the allusions , from the nature of the subject , are , no doubt , difficult ; but a feeling of loftiness , of harmony , of proportion , remains in the mind at the close of the poem , which is not likely to pass away . How , then , was this effect produced ? First of all we see that Gray had selected a good subject ; his raw materials , so to speak , were poetical . The imagination , unembarrassed by common associations , breathes freely in its own region , and is instinctively elevated as it moves among the great events of the past , dwelling on the misfortunes of monarchs , the rise of dynasties , and the splendours of literature . But , in the second place , when he has chosen his subject , it is the part of the poet to impress the great ideas derived from it on the feelings and the memory by the distinctness of the form under which he presents it ; and here poetical invention first begins to work . By the imaginative fiction of ‘ The Bard , ’ Gray is enabled to cast the whole course of English history into the form of a prophecy , and to excite the patriotic feelings of the reader , as Virgil roused the pride of his own countrymen by Anchises ’ forecast of the grandeur of Rome . Finally , when the main design of the poem is thus conceived , observe with what art all the different parts are made to emphasize the beauty of the general conception ; with what dramatic propriety the calamities of the conquering Plantagenet are prophesied by his vanquished foe ; while on the other hand , the literary glories of the Tudor Elizabeth awaken the triumph of the patriot and the poet ; how martial and spirited is the opening of the poem ! how lofty and enthusiastic its close ! Perhaps there is no English lyric which , animated by equal fervour , displays so much architectural genius as ‘ The Bard . ’</p>
    <p n="10">“ Take , again , the ‘ Ode on the Prospect of Eton College . ’ A subject better adapted far the indulgence of personal feeling , or for those sentimental confidences between the reader and the poet , in which the modern muse so much delights , could not be imagined . But what do we find ? The theme is treated in the most general manner . Though emphasizing the irony of his reflection by the beautiful touch of memory in the second stanza , the poet speaks throughout as a moralist or spectator ; from first to last he seems to lose all thought of himself in contemplating the tragedies he foresees for others ; the subject is in fact handled with the most skilful rhetoric , and every stanza is made to strengthen and elaborate the leading thought . In the ‘ Progress of Poesy , ’ though the general constructive effect is perhaps inferior to ‘ The Bard , ’ we see the same evidence of careful preconsideration , while the course of the poem is particularly distinguished by the beauty of the transitions . Of the form of the ‘ Elegy ’ it is superfluous to speak ; a poem so dignified and yet so tender , appeals immediately , and will continue to appeal , to the heart of every Englishman , so long as the care of public liberty and love of the soil maintain their hold in this country . In this poem , as indeed in all that Gray ever wrote , we find it his first principle to prefer his subject to himself ; he never forgot that while he was a man he was also an artist , and he knew that the function of art was not merely to indulge nature , but to dignify and refine it .</p>
    <p n="11">“ Yet , in spite of his love of form , there is nothing frigid or statuesque in the genius of Gray . A vein of deep melancholy , evidently constitutional , runs through his poetry , and , considering how little he produced , the number of personal allusions in his verses is undoubtedly large . But he is entirely free from that egotism which we have had frequent occasion to blame as the prevailing vice of modern poetry . For whereas the modern poet thrusts his private feelings into prominence , and finds a luxury in the confession of his sorrows , Gray 's references to himself are introduced on public grounds , or , in other words , with a view to poetical effect . He , like our own bards , is ‘ condemned to groan , ’ but for different reasons —</p>
    <p n="12">‘ The tender for another 's pain , The unfeeling for his own . ’</p>
    <p n="13">“ We have already remarked on the public character of the ‘ Ode on Eton College ; ’ but the second stanza of this poem is a pure expression of individual feeling :</p>
    <p n="14">‘ Ah , happy hills ! ah , pleasing shade ! Ah , fields belov 'd in vain ! Where once my careless childhood play 'd , A stranger yet to pain ! I feel the gales that from ye blow A momentary bliss bestow , As waving fresh their gladsome wing , My weary soul they seem to soothe , And , redolent of joy and youth , To breathe a second spring . ’</p>
    <p n="15">Every one will perceive the art which enforces the truth of the general reflections that follow by the personal experience of the speaker . Again , the ‘ Progress of Poesy ’ closes with a personal allusion which , as it is a climax , might , if ill-managed , have appeared arrogant , but which is , in fact , a masterpiece of oratory . After confessing his own inferiority to Pindar , the poet proceeds :</p>
    <p n="16">‘ Yet oft before his infant eyes would run Such forms as glitter in the Muse 's ray , With orient hues , unborrow 'd of the sun ; Yet shall he mount , and keep his distant way , Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate , Beneath the Good how far — but far above the Great ! ’</p>
    <p n="17">There is something very noble in the elevated manner in which the self-complacent triumph of genius , expressed by so many poets from Ennius downwards , is at once justified and chastened by the reflection in these lines . We see in them that the poet alludes to himself in the third person , and he repeats this style in the ‘ Elegy , ’ where , after the fourth line , the first personal pronoun is never again used . How just and beautiful is the turn where , after contemplating the general lot of the lowly society he is celebrating , he proceeds to identify his own fate with theirs :</p>
    <p n="18">‘ For thee , who , mindful of th ’ unhonour 'd dead , Dost in these lines their artless tale relate , If , chance , by lonely contemplation led , Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate ,</p>
    <p n="19">‘ Haply some hoary-headed swain may say , ’ etc .</p>
    <p n="20">“ The two great characteristics of Gray 's poetry that we have noticed — his self-suppression and his sense of form and dignity — are best described by the word ‘ classical . ’ What we particularly admire in the great authors of Greece and Rome is their public spirit . Their writings are full of patriotism , good-breeding , and common-sense , and have that happy mixture of art and nature which is only acquired by men who have learned from liberty how to discipline individual instincts by social refinement . Their style is masculine , clear , and moderate ; they seem , as it were , never to lose the sense of being before an audience , and , like orators who know that they are always exposed to the judgment of their intellectual equals , they aim at putting intelligible thoughts into the most natural and forcible words . Precisely the same qualities are observable in all the best English writers of the eighteenth century . Addison , Pope , and Goldsmith are perhaps the most shining examples , but the rest are ‘ classical ’ in the sense which we have just indicated ; and we can hardly be wrong in ascribing this common rhetorical instinct to the intimate connection between the men of thought and the men of action , which existed both in the free states of antiquity , and in England under the rule of the aristocracy . With the advance of the eighteenth century the instinct in English literature seems to grow weaker ; the style of our authors becomes more formal and constrained , and symptoms of that dislike of society encouraged by the philosophy of Rousseau more frequently betray themselves . As the poetry of Cowper shows less social instinct than that of Gray , so Gray himself is inferior in this respect to Pope and Goldsmith . But his style has the same lofty public spirit that distinguishes his favourite models , and no worthier form could be imagined to express the ardour excited in the heart of a patriotic poet by the rising fortunes of his native country . We feel that it is in every way fitting that the author of the ‘ Elegy ’ should have been the favourite of Wolfe and the countryman of Chatham . ”</p>
