    <docTitle><titlePart>In the present edition of Crabbe 's Poems the general arrangement adopted is that of the chronological order of publication . The poem entitled Midnight has been inserted at a conjectural date as belonging to the period of the Juvenile Poems ( 1772-1780 ) ; but all other poems contained in this edition which have hitherto remained unpublished will be printed after the published poems , in the sequence of their production so far as this is ascertainable . With the poems hitherto unpublished I have also been fortunate enough to obtain permission to include in a later volume , among other posthumously printed pieces , the Two Poetical Epistles by Crabbe , first published , from a manuscript in the collection of Mr Buxton Forman , in Vol . II of Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century edited by W. Robertson Nicoll and Thomas J . Wise ( London , 1896 ) . From the second of these Epistles were taken , but not in their original order , the ten lines reproduced in the present volume from George Crabbe the younger 's 1834 edition of his father 's Poems . The earliest of the Juvenile Poems here printed are taken from The Lady 's Magazine , or Entertaining Companion for the Fair Sex , appropriated solely to their Use and Amusement , for the year 1772 , printed at London for Robinson and Roberts , 25 Paternoster Row . The first volume of this Magazine seems to have been that for the year 1770 , and to have comprised the numbers from August to December inclusive ; but the earlier portion of this volume had been previously published in the same year 1770 under the same title by J. Wheble at 20 Paternoster Row , ‘ by whom letters to the Editor are requested and received . ’ This then must be the ‘ Wheble 's Magazine for 1772 , ’ of which George Crabbe the younger in the Life prefixed to the 1834 edition of his father 's Poems ( p. 22 ) states that he had after long search discovered a copy . The Magazine seems itself to have been a revival of an earlier Lady 's Magazine , of which portions of the volumes for 1760 and 1761 are extant , and which , according to the title-page of the volume for 1761 , was printed for J. Wilkie at the Bible in St Paul 's Churchyard .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>But the younger Crabbe 's account of his father 's verses in ‘ Wheble 's Magazine for<date>1772</date>’ does not tally with the actual contents of the volume for<date>1772</date>of The Lady 's Magazine which has been used for the present edition . It is possible , of course , though there is no evidence to support the supposition , that The Lady 's Magazine published by Wheble was continued at all events till<date>1772</date>, parallel to The Lady 's Magazine published by Robinson and Roberts , with which in<date>1770</date>it had been in some measure blended . It is equally possible that the younger Crabbe made some mistake or mistakes . In any case , his statement is , that Wheble 's Magazine for<date>1772</date>‘ contains besides the prize poem on Hope , ’ from which he proceeds to quote the concluding six lines , ‘ four other pieces , signed “ G. C ., Woodbridge , Suffolk , ” “ To Mira , ” “ The Atheist reclaimed , ” “ The Bee , ” and “ An Allegorical Fable . " ’ The volume published by Robinson and Roberts contains no pieces corresponding to these , except that in its October number there is printed an Essay on Hope , in which the lines cited by the younger Crabbe and reprinted , on his authority , in the present edition , do not appear , but of which the concluding lines seem to imply that it was a copy of verses written in competition for a prize . It cannot however be by Crabbe . For it is signed ‘ C. C ., Rotherhithe ,<date>1772</date>’ ; and the July number of the same volume contains a piece of verse of some length entitled The Rotherhithe Beauties and signed ‘ C. C ., Rotherhithe , July 15 , ’ which is certainly not by Crabbe ; and later in the volume follows another piece entitled Night , signed ‘ C. C ., Rotherhithe , November 19 ,<date>1772</date>, ’ which likewise cannot be attributed to Crabbe . On the other hand the<date>1772</date>volume of The Lady 's Magazine contains certain pieces of verse which may without hesitation be assigned to him , and which are accordingly reprinted in the present edition . These are , in the September number , Solitude and A Song , which bear as a signature the quasi-anagram ‘ G. EBBARE ’ ; in the October number , the lines To Emma , with the quasi-anagram ‘ G. EBBAAC ’ and the date ‘ Suffolk ’ ; and , in the November number , Despair , Cupid , and a Song , signed with the earlier form ‘ G. EBBARE . ’ This Song is followed by some lines in blank verse On the Wonders of Creation , and , further on , by some stanzas To Friendship , likewise signed ‘ C. C . ’ ; but manifestly neither blank verse nor stanzas are by Crabbe . Finally , it should be noted that in the October number in the same volume the following occurs among the notices To our Correspondents : ‘ The birth of a Maccaroni , by Ebbare , in the style of the Scriptures , seems to be taking too great a liberty with things sacred ; and it is our maxim , as far as possible , to abstain from every appearance of evil . ’ The Lady 's Magazine continued to be published by Robinson and Roberts for many subsequent years ; and it is a curious coincidence that No . 5 of Vol . XLVII ( for May ,<date>1816</date>) contains some stanzas entitled Myra 's Wedding-Day . The remaining Juvenilia printed in the present edition are partly reproduced from the Fragments of Verse , from Mr Crabbe 's early Note-Books in Vol . II of the<date>1834</date>edition , partly from the Life in Vol . I of the same . The lines On the Death of William Springall Levett are quoted in the latter from Green 's History of Framlingham , which has been compared . Of the poems which follow in the present volume , Inebriety is here printed from a copy of the quarto of<date>1775</date>, which lacks a title-page and which bears on p. 1 the following deprecation in Crabbe 's handwriting : ‘ NB .— pray let not this be seen at [ cipher ] there is very little of it that I 'm not heartily asham 'd of . ’ The imprint of the title-page here given is taken from the Life (<date>1834</date>, p. 28 ) . Midnight , a Poem , is now first printed from the original manuscript which formed part of Dawson Turner 's collection , in which it was numbered 121 at the sale of Dawson Turner 's manuscripts in June ,<date>1859</date>. Its handwriting , as Professor Dowden points out , is identical with that of a facsimile in a passage from the Two Epistles mentioned above , given in the Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century . The Candidate is printed from the edition of<date>1834</date>( Vol . II , Appendix ) . This poem is not included in the edition of<date>1823</date>, and after a long quest it has proved impossible to obtain a copy of the original edition of<date>1780</date>( published in quarto by H. Payne , opposite Marlborough House , Pall Mall ) . This edition is not in the British Museum . It was only possible to compare the forty-six lines of the poem quoted in The Monthly Review for September ,<date>1780</date>; but no variants have been found in these . The subsequent poems contained in the present volume are all printed from the edition of<date>1823</date>, the last edition published in<country>England</country>in the poet 's lifetime . The Variants enumerated at the close of this volume are in each case the readings of the first editions of the several poems , viz ., The Library ,<date>1781</date>, The Village ,<date>1783</date>, The Newspaper ,<date>1785</date>, The Parish Register &amp; c .,<date>1807</date>, and The Borough ,<date>1810</date>. The address To the Reader prefixed to The Newspaper , which does not appear in the edition of<date>1823</date>, has been restored from that of<date>1785</date>, as it appears in the younger Crabbe 's edition of<date>1834</date>. The list of Errata includes all the misprints , slips of the pen , and unintentional mistakes of spelling or quotation , which have been found in the texts which have been reprinted in this volume . The reading substituted here is in each case enclosed in square brackets . The list is a long one , for Crabbe was a careless writer ; and in the matter of quotations ( as the concluding sentence of the Preface to The Borough indicates ) was not given to over-conscientiousness . It has seemed permissible , where this could be done , to supplement the poet 's statements as to the sources of his quotations ; but there are instances in which these statements themselves remain more or less doubtful . Crabbe 's interpunctuation is so arbitrary , and , though no doubt largely determined by what might be described as the movement of the writer 's mind , so frequently at variance even with the practice ( it can hardly be called system ) which he more usually follows , that it has been thought right to use as much freedom on this head as seemed consistent with a due respect for the author 's intention . No alteration has been made in the matter of interpunctuation which was not warranted either by the poet 's ordinary practice , or by the primary necessity of making his meaning clear . As complete as possible a bibliography of Crabbe 's Poems will , it is hoped , be published in the concluding volume of this edition . There remains the pleasant duty of thanking those whose kindness has been of assistance in the preparation of this volume . The relatives of my dear friend the late Canon AINGER have allowed me to retain for this purpose the first editions of Inebriety ( with Crabbe 's autograph ) , The Village and The Newspaper which he had lent me not long before his death . The Vice-Master of Trinity , Mr W. ALDIS WRIGHT , besides enabling me to borrow from Trinity Library the first edition of The Library , kindly lent his own copy of the Poems published in<date>1807</date>. I am indebted to Professor EDWARD DOWDEN , LL. D ., of Trinity College ,<settlement>Dublin</settlement>, for various services generously rendered by him to this edition of Crabbe , which will benefit from them in its concluding as it has in its opening volume . He has readily allowed me to print the whole of the interesting blank verse poem of Midnight , which , in his own words , ‘ unless it be a transcript by Crabbe from some other eighteenth-century poet , of which there is no evidence , may be assumed to be of his authorship . ’ To the same kind friend , and to the special courtesy of Mr J. W. LYSTER , Librarian of the National Library of Ireland , Kildare Street ,<settlement>Dublin</settlement>, I owe the opportunity of tracing fide oculata , so far as it seems possible to make sure of it , the elusive volume of The Lady 's Magazine containing the earliest of Crabbe 's printed verse . Mr A. R. WALLER , of Peterhouse , Assistant Secretary to the Syndics of the University Press , has in many ways facilitated the preparation of this volume . And without the unstinting and unflagging cooperation of another member of my College , Mr A. T. BARTHOLOMEW , of the University Library , who has compiled the list of variants , besides giving me much other assistance , I could not , amidst other engagements , have carried so far the execution of a delightful task .

    <head>INEBRIETY .</head>
    <note>Inebriety , a Poem , in three Parts . Ipswich , printed and sold by C. Punchard , Bookseller , in the Butter-Market , 1775 . Price one shilling and sixpence .</note>
     <l n="1">The PREFACE .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Presumption or Meanness are but too often the only articles to be discovered in a Preface . Whilst one author haughtily affects to despise the public attention , another timidly courts it . I would no more beg for than disdain applause , and therefore should advance nothing in Favor of the following little Poem , did it not appear a Cruelty and disregard to send a first Production naked into the WORLD .</p>
   <p>The WORLD !— how pompous , and yet how trifling the sound . Every MAN , Gentle Reader , has a WORLD of his own , &amp; whether it consists of half a score , or half a thousand Friends , ‘ tis his , and he loves to boast of it . Into my WORLD , therefore , I commit this , my Muse 's earliest labor , nothing doubting the Clemency of the Climate , nor fearing the Partiality of the censorious .</p>
   <p>Something by way of Apology for this trifle , is perhaps necessary ; especially for those parts , wherein I have taken such great Liberties with Mr. POPE ; that Gentleman , secure in immortal Fame , would forgive me ; forgive me too , my friendly Critic ; I promise thee , thou wilt find the Extracts from the Swan of Thames the best Parts of the Performance ; Few , I dare venture to affirm , will pay me so great a Compliment , as to think I have injured Mr POPE ; Fewer , I hope , will think I endeavoured to do it , and Fewest of all will think any thing about it .</p>
   <p>The LADIES will doubtless favor my Attempt ; for them indeed it was principally composed ; I have endeavored to demonstrate that it is their own Faults , if they are not deemed as good MEN , as half the masculine World ; that a personal Difference of Sex need not make a real Difference ; and that a tender Languishment , a refin 'd Delicacy , and a particular attention to shine in Dress , will render the Beau-Animal infinitely more feminine , than the generality of LADIES , whatever arcane Tokens of Manhood the said Animal may be indued with ; and yet , ye FAIR ! these creatures pass even in your catalogue for MEN ; which I 'm afraid is a Demonstration that the real MAN is very scarce .</p>
   <p>Some grave Head or other may possibly tell me , that Vice is to be lash 'd , not indulg 'd ; that true Poetry forbids , not encourages , Folly ; and such other wise and weighty Sentences , picked from POPE and HORACE , as he shall think most appertaining to his own dignity . But this , my good Reader , is a trifle ; People now a Days are not to be preach 'd into Reflection , or they pay Parsons , not Poets for it , if they were ; they listen indeed to a Discourse from the Pulpit , for MEN are too wise to give away their Money without any consideration ; and though they do n't mind what is said there , ‘ tis doubtless a great Satisfaction to think they might if they choose it ; but a MAN reads a Poem for quite a different purpose : to be lul 'd into ease from reflection , to be lul 'd into an inclination for pleasure , and ( where I confess it comes nearer the Sermon ) to be lul 'd — asleep .</p>
   <p>But lest the Apology should have the latter effect in itself , and so take away the merit of the Performance by forestalling that agreeable Event : I without further ceremony bid thee Adieu !</p>
   <p>PART the FIRST .</p>

     <l n="29">The labouring Pulse a slower motion rules ,</l>

     <l n="40">Ale and content the labouring peasants warm ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">O'er the dull embers happy Colin sits ,</l>
     <l n="42">Colin , the prince of joke and rural wits ;</l>
     <l n="43">Whilst the wind whistles through the hollow panes ,</l>
     <l n="44">He drinks , nor of the rude assault complains ;</l>
     <l n="45">And tells the Tale , from sire to son retold ,</l>

     <l n="47">Of moon-clad Imps , that tremble by the dew ,</l>

     <l n="49">The throng invisible , that doubtless float</l>

     <l n="21">As soon divine by dreaming of the gods , 20</l>

     <l n="31">No potent Dean commends thy head or heart ! 30</l>
     <l n="32">What gain'st thou but the praises of the poor ?</l>
     <l n="33">They bribe no milkman to thy lofty door ,</l>
     <l n="34">They wipe no scrawl from thy increasing score .</l>
     <l n="35">What did the Muse , or Fame , for Dryden , say ?</l>

     <l n="41">Like thee , elate at what thou canst not know ; 40</l>
     <l n="42">Like thee , repining at each puny blow ;</l>

     <l n="44">Upon their wits — but with a larger stock .</l>
     <l n="45">No , if for food thy unambitious pray'r ,</l>
     <l n="46">With supple acts to supple minds repair ;</l>
     <l n="47">Learn of the base in soft grimace to deal ,</l>

     <l n="50">Draw teeth , or any viler thing but write .</l>
     <l n="51">Writers , whom once th ’ astonish 'd vulgar saw 50</l>

     <l n="60">To shape the useful to a nobler use .</l>
     <l n="61">Some few of these a statue and a stone 60</l>
     <l n="62">Has Fame decreed — but deals out bread to none .</l>
     <l n="63">Unhappy art ! decreed thine owner 's curse ,</l>

     <l n="71">Oft have I read , and , reading , mourn 'd the fate 70</l>
     <l n="72">Of garret-bard , and his unpitied mate ;</l>
     <l n="73">Of children stinted in their daily meal ,—</l>
     <l n="74">The joke of wealthier wits who could not feel .</l>
     <l n="75">Portentous spoke that pity in my breast ,</l>
     <l n="76">And pleaded self — who ever pleads the best .</l>
     <l n="77">No ! thank my stars , my misery 's all my own —</l>
     <l n="78">To friends , to family , to foes unknown ;</l>
     <l n="79">Who hates my verse , and damns the mean design ,</l>
     <l n="80">Shall wound no peace — shall grieve no heart but mine .</l>
     <l n="81">One trial past , let sober Reason speak : 80</l>
     <l n="82">Here shall we rest , or shall we further seek ?</l>
     <l n="83">Rest here , if our relenting stars ordain</l>
     <l n="84">A placid harbour from the stormy main ;</l>
     <l n="85">Or , that denied , the fond remembrance weep ,</l>
     <l n="86">And sink , forgotten , in the mighty deep .</l>

    <head>TO THE READER .</head>
     <l n="1">The following Poem being itself of an introductory nature , its author</l>
     <l n="2">supposes it can require but little preface .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is published with a view of obtaining the opinion of the candid and judicious reader on the merits of the writer as a poet ; very few , he apprehends , being in such cases sufficiently impartial to decide for themselves .</p>
   <p>It is addressed to the Authors of the Monthly Review , as to critics of acknowledged merit ; an acquaintance with whose labours has afforded the writer of this Epistle a reason for directing it to them in particular , and , he presumes , will yield to others a just and sufficient plea for the preference .</p>
   <p>Familiar with disappointment , he shall not be much surprised to find he has mistaken his talent . However , if not egregiously the dupe of his vanity , he promises to his readers some entertainment , and is assured that , however little in the ensuing Poem is worthy of applause , there is yet less that merits contempt .</p>

     <l n="240">Such were the themes I knew in school-day ease , 240</l>
     <l n="241">When first the moral magic learn 'd to please ;</l>
     <l n="242">Ere Judgment told how transports warm 'd the breast ,</l>
     <l n="243">Transported Fancy there her stores imprest ;</l>
     <l n="244">The soul in varied raptures learn 'd to fly ,</l>
     <l n="245">Felt all their force , and never question 'd why .</l>
     <l n="246">No idle doubts could then her peace molest ;</l>
     <l n="247">She found delight , and left to heaven the rest .</l>

     <l n="250">When the wild thought roved vision 's circuit o'er , 250</l>
     <l n="251">And caught the raptures , caught , alas ! no more :</l>
     <l n="252">No care did then a dull attention ask ,</l>
     <l n="253">For study pleased , and that was every task ;</l>
     <l n="254">No guilty dreams stalk 'd that heaven-favour 'd round ,</l>
     <l n="255">Heaven-guarded too ; no Envy entrance found ;</l>

   <p>TO THE</p>
   <p>RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY RICHARD FOX ,</p>
   <p>LORD HOLLAND ,</p>
   <p>OF HOLLAND , IN LINCOLNSHIRE ; LORD HOLLAND OF FOXLEY ; AND FELLOW OF THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES .</p>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>That the longest poem in this collection was honoured by the notice of your Lordship 's right honourable and ever-valued relation , Mr. FOX ; that it should be the last which engaged his attention ; and that some parts of it were marked with his approbation : are circumstances productive of better hopes of ultimate success than I had dared to entertain before I was gratified with a knowledge of them ; and the hope thus raised leads me to ask permission that I may dedicate this book to your Lordship , to whom that truly great and greatly lamented personage was so nearly allied in family , so closely bound in affection , and in whose mind presides the same critical taste which he exerted to the delight of all who heard him . He doubtless united with his unequalled abilities a fund of good-nature ; and this possibly led him to speak favourably of , and give satisfaction to writers , with whose productions he might not be entirely satisfied ; nor must I allow myself to suppose his desire of obliging was withholden , when he honoured any effort of mine with his approbation . But , my Lord , as there was discrimination in the opinion he gave ; as he did not veil indifference for insipid mediocrity of composition under any general expression of cool approval : I allow myself to draw a favourable conclusion from the verdict of one who had the superiority of intellect few would dispute , which he made manifest by a force of eloquence peculiar to himself ; whose excellent judgment no one of his friends found cause to distrust , and whose acknowledged candour no enemy had the temerity to deny .</p>
   <p>With such encouragement , I present my book to your Lordship : the Account of the Life and Writings of Lopez de Vega has taught me what I am to expect ; I there perceive how your Lordship can write , and am there taught how you can judge of writers : my faults , however numerous , I know will none of them escape through inattention , nor will any merit be lost for want of discernment ; my verses are before him who has written elegantly , who has judged with accuracy , and who has given unequivocal proof of abilities in a work of difficulty — a translation of poetry , which few persons in this kingdom are able to read , and in the estimation of talents not hitherto justly appreciated . In this view , I cannot but feel some apprehension ; but I know also , that your Lordship is apprised of the great difficulty of writing well ; that you will make much allowance for failures , if not too frequently repeated ; and , as you can accurately discern , so you will readily approve , all the better and more happy efforts of one who places the highest value upon your Lordship 's approbation , and who has the honour to be ,</p>
   <p>My LORD ,</p>
   <p>Your Lordship 's most faithful</p>
   <p>and obliged humble servant ,</p>
   <p>GEO . CRABBE .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>About twenty-five years since was published a poem called “ The Library , ” which , in no long time , was followed by two others , “ The Village , ” and “ The Newspaper . ” These , with a few alterations and additions , are here reprinted ; and are accompanied by a poem of greater length , and several shorter attempts , now , for the first time , before the public ; whose reception of them creates in their author something more than common solicitude , because he conceives that , with the judgment to be formed of these latter productions , upon whatever may be found intrinsically meritorious or defective , there will be united an inquiry into the relative degree of praise or blame which they may be thought to deserve , when compared with the more early attempts of the same writer .</p>
   <p>And certainly , were it the principal employment of a man 's life to compose verses , it might seem reasonable to expect that he would continue to improve as long as he continued to live ; though , even then , there is some doubt whether such improvement would follow , and perhaps proof might be adduced to show it would not . But when , to this “ idle trade ” is added some “ calling , ” with superior claims upon his time and attention , his progress in the art of versification will probably be in proportion neither to the years he has lived , nor even to the attempts he has made .</p>
   <p>While composing the first-published of these poems , the author was honoured with the notice and assisted by the advice of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke ; part of it was written in his presence , and the whole submitted to his judgment ; receiving , in its progress , the benefit of his correction . I hope , therefore , to obtain pardon of the reader , if I eagerly seize the occasion , and , after so long a silence , endeavour to express a grateful sense of the benefits I have received from this gentleman , who was solicitous for my more essential interests , as well as benevolently anxious for my credit as a writer .</p>
   <p>I will not enter upon the subject of his extraordinary abilities ; it would be vanity , it would be weakness , in me to believe that I could make them better known or more admired than they now are . But of his private worth , of his wishes to do good , of his affability and condescension ; his readiness to lend assistance when he knew it was wanted , and his delight to give praise where he thought it was deserved : of these I may write with some propriety . All know that his powers were vast , his acquirements various ; and I take leave to add , that he applied them with unremitted attention to those objects which he believed tended to the honour and welfare of his country . But it may not be so generally understood that he was ever assiduous in the more private duties of a benevolent nature ; that he delighted to give encouragement to any promise of ability , and assistance to any appearance of desert . To what purposes he employed his pen , and with what eloquence he spake in the senate , will be told by many , who yet may be ignorant of the solid instruction , as well as the fascinating pleasantry , found in his common conversation , amongst his friends , and his affectionate manners , amiable disposition , and zeal for their happiness , which he manifested in the hours of retirement with his family .</p>
   <p>To this gentleman I was indebted for my knowledge of Sir Joshua Reynolds , who was as well known to his friends for his perpetual fund of good-humour and his unceasing wishes to oblige , as he was to the public for the extraordinary productions of his pencil and his pen . By him I was favoured with an introduction to Doctor Johnson , who honoured me with his notice , and assisted me , as Mr. Boswell has told , with remarks and emendations for a poem I was about to publish . The doctor had been often wearied by applications , and did not readily comply with requests for his opinion : not from any unwillingness to oblige , but from a painful contention in his mind between a desire of giving pleasure and a determination to speak truth . No man can , I think , publish a work without some expectation of satisfying those who are to judge of its merit ; but I can , with the utmost regard to veracity , speak my fears , as predominating over every pre-indulged thought of a more favourable nature , when I was told that a judge so discerning had consented to read and give his opinion of “ The Village , ” the poem I had prepared for publication . The time of suspense was not long protracted ; I was soon favoured with a few words from Sir Joshua , who observed , “ If I knew how cautious Doctor Johnson was in giving commendation , I should be well satisfied with the portion dealt to me in his letter . ” Of that letter the following is a copy :</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>“ SIR ,</head>
    <head>“ I have sent you back Mr. Crabbe 's poem , which I read with great delight . It is original , vigorous , and elegant . The alterations which I have made , I do not require him to adopt ; for my lines are , perhaps , not often better [ than ] his own : but he may take mine and his own together , and perhaps , between them , produce something better than either .— He is not to think his copy wantonly defaced ; a wet sponge will wash all the red lines away , and leave the pages clean .— His Dedication will be least liked : it were better to contract it into a short sprightly address .— I do not doubt of Mr. Crabbe 's success .</head>

   <p>That I was fully satisfied , my readers will do me the justice to believe ; and I hope they will pardon me , if there should appear to them any impropriety in publishing the favourable opinion expressed in a private letter : they will judge , and truly , that by so doing , I wish to bespeak their good opinion , but have no design of extorting their applause . I would not hazard an appearance so ostentatious to gratify my vanity , but I venture to do it in compliance with my fears .</p>
   <p>After these was published “ The Newspaper ": it had not the advantage of such previous criticism from any friends , nor perhaps so much of my own attention as I ought to have given to it ; but the impression was disposed of , and I will not pay so little respect to the judgment of my readers as now to suppress they then approved .</p>
   <p>Since the publication of this poem more than twenty years have elapsed , and I am not without apprehension , lest so long a silence should be construed into a blamable neglect of my own interest , which those excellent friends were desirous of promoting ; or , what is yet worse , into a want of gratitude for their assistance , since it becomes me to suppose , they considered these first attempts as promises of better things , and their favours as stimulants to future exertion . And here , be the construction put upon my apparent negligence what it may , let me not suppress my testimony to the liberality of those who are looked up to as patrons and encouragers of literary merit , or indeed of merit of any kind : their patronage has never been refused , I conceive , when it has been reasonably expected or modestly required ; and it would be difficult , probably , to instance , in these times and in this country , any one who merited or was supposed to merit assistance , but who nevertheless languished in obscurity or necessity for want of it ; unless in those cases where it was prevented by the resolution of impatient pride , or wearied by the solicitations of determined profligacy . And , while the subject is before me , I am unwilling to pass silently over the debt of gratitude which I owe to the memory of two deceased noblemen , His Grace the late Duke of Rutland , and the Right Honourable the Lord Thurlow : sensible of the honour done me by their notice , and the benefits received from them , I trust this acknowledgment will be imputed to its only motive , a grateful sense of their favours .</p>
   <p>Upon this subject I could dwell with much pleasure ; but , to give a reason for that appearance of neglect , as it is more difficult , so , happily , it is less required . In truth , I have , for many years , intended a republication of these poems , as soon as I should be able to join with them such other of later date as might not deprive me of the little credit the former had obtained . Long indeed has this purpose been procrastinated ; and , if the duties of a profession , not before pressing upon me — if the claims of a situation , at that time untried — if diffidence of my own judgment , and the loss of my earliest friends , will not sufficiently account for my delay , I must rely upon the good-nature of my reader , that he will let them avail as far as he can , and find an additional apology in my fears of his censure .</p>
   <p>These fears being so prevalent with me , I determined not to publish any thing more , unless I could first obtain the sanction of such an opinion as I might with some confidence rely upon . I looked for a friend who , having the discerning taste of Mr. Burke , and the critical sagacity of Doctor Johnson , would bestow upon my MS. the attention requisite to form his opinion , and would then favour me with the result of his observations ; and it was my singular good fortune to gain such assistance ; the opinion of a critic so qualified , and a friend so disposed to favour me . I had been honoured by an introduction to the Right Honourable Charles James Fox some years before , at the seat of Mr. Burke ; and , being again with him , I received a promise that he would peruse any work I might send to him previous to its publication , and would give me his opinion . At that time , I did not think myself sufficiently prepared ; and when , afterwards , I had collected some poems for his inspection , I found my right honourable friend engaged by the affairs of a great empire , and struggling with the inveteracy of a fatal disease ; at such time , upon such mind , ever disposed to oblige as that mind was , I could not obtrude the petty business of criticising verses ; but he remembered the promise he had kindly given , and repeated an offer , which , though I had not presumed to expect , I was happy to receive . A copy of the poems , now first published , was immediately sent to him , and ( as I have the information from Lord Holland , and his Lordship 's permission to inform my readers ) the poem which I have named “ The Parish Register ” was heard by Mr. Fox , and it excited interest enough , by some of its parts , to gain for me the benefit of his judgment upon the whole . Whatever he approved , the reader will readily believe , I have carefully retained ; the parts he disliked are totally expunged , and others are substituted , which I hope resemble those , more conformable to the taste of so admirable a judge . Nor can I deny myself the melancholy satisfaction of adding , that this poem ( and more especially the story of Phoebe Dawson , with some parts of the second book ) , were the last compositions of their kind that engaged and amused the capacious , the candid , the benevolent mind of this great man .</p>
   <p>The above information I owe to the favour of the Right Honourable Lord Holland ; nor this only , but to his Lordship I am indebted for some excellent remarks upon the other parts of my MS . It was not indeed my good fortune then to know that my verses were in the hands of a nobleman who had given proof of his accurate judgment as a critic , and his elegance as a writer , by favouring the public with an easy and spirited translation of some interesting scenes of a dramatic poet , not often read in this kingdom . The Life of Lopez de Vega was then unknown to me ; I had , in common with many English readers , heard of him , but could not judge whether his far-extended reputation was caused by the sublime efforts of a mighty genius , or the unequalled facility of a rapid composer , aided by peculiar and fortunate circumstances . That any part of my MS. was honoured by the remarks of Lord Holland yields me a high degree of satisfaction , and his Lordship will perceive the use I have made of them ; but I must feel some regret when I know to what small portion they were limited ; and discerning , as I do , the taste and judgment bestowed upon the verses of Lopez de Vega , I must perceive how much my own needed the assistance afforded to one who cannot be sensible of the benefit he has received .</p>
   <p>But how much soever I may lament the advantages lost , let me remember with gratitude the helps I have obtained . With a single exception , every poem in the ensuing collection has been submitted to the critical sagacity of a gentleman , upon whose skill and candour their author could rely . To publish by advice of friends has been severely ridiculed , and that too by a poet , who probably , without such advice , never made public any verses of his own : in fact , it may not be easily determined who acts with less discretion , the writer who is encouraged to publish his works , merely by the advice of friends whom he consulted , or he who , against advice , publishes from the sole encouragement of his own opinion . These are deceptions to be carefully avoided ; and I was happy to escape the latter , by the friendly attentions of the Reverend Richard Turner , minister of Great Yarmouth . To this gentleman I am indebted more than I am able to describe , or than he is willing to allow , for the time he has bestowed upon the attempts I have made . He is , indeed , the kind of critic for whom every poet should devoutly wish , and the friend whom every man would be happy to acquire ; he has taste to discern all that is meritorious , and sagacity to detect whatsoever should be discarded ; he gives just the opinion an author 's wisdom should covet , however his vanity might prompt him to reject it ; what altogether to expunge and what to improve he has repeatedly taught me , and , could I have obeyed him in the latter direction , as I invariably have in the former , the public would have found this collection more worthy its attention , and I should have sought the opinion of the critic more void of apprehension .</p>
   <p>But whatever I may hope or fear , whatever assistance I have had or have needed , it becomes me to leave my verses to the judgment of the reader , without my endeavour to point out their merit , or an apology for their defects . Yet as , among the poetical attempts of one who has been for many years a priest , it may seem a want of respect for the legitimate objects of his study , that nothing occurs , unless it be incidentally , of the great subjects of religion : so it may appear a kind of ingratitude of a beneficed clergyman , that he has not employed his talent ( be it estimated as it may ) to some patriotic purpose — as in celebrating the unsubdued spirit of his countrymen in their glorious resistance of those enemies , who would have no peace throughout the world , except that which is dictated to the drooping spirit of suffering humanity by the triumphant insolence of military success .</p>
   <p>Credit will be given to me , I hope , when I affirm that subjects so interesting have the due weight with me , which the sacred nature of the one , and the national importance of the other , must impress upon every mind not seduced into carelessness for religion by the lethargic influence of a perverted philosophy , nor into indifference for the cause of our country by hyperbolical or hypocritical professions of universal philanthropy ; but , after many efforts to satisfy myself by various trials on these subjects , I declined all further attempt , from a conviction that I should not be able to give satisfaction to my readers . Poetry of religious nature must indeed ever be clogged with almost insuperable difficulty ; but there are doubtless to be found poets who are well qualified to celebrate the unanimous and heroic spirit of our countrymen , and to describe in appropriate colours some of those extraordinary scenes , which have been and are shifting in the face of Europe , with such dreadful celerity ; and to such I relinquish the duty .</p>
   <p>It remains for me to give the reader a brief view of those articles in the following collection , which for the first time solicit his attention .</p>
   <p>In the “ Parish Register , ” he will find an endeavour once more to describe village-manners , not by adopting the notion of pastoral simplicity or assuming ideas of rustic barbarity , but by more natural views of the peasantry , considered as a mixed body of persons , sober or profligate , and hence , in a great measure , contented or miserable . To this more general description are added the various characters which occur in the three parts of a Register : Baptism , Marriages , and Burials .</p>
   <p>If the “ Birth of Flattery ” offer no moral , as an appendage to the fable , it is hoped that nothing of an immoral , nothing of improper , tendency will be imputed to a piece of poetical playfulness . In fact , genuine praise , like all other species of truth , is known by its bearing full investigation : it is what the giver is happy that he can justly bestow , and the receiver conscious that he may boldly accept ; but adulation must ever be afraid of inquiry , and must , in proportion to their degrees of moral sensibility ,</p>
   <p>Be shame “ to him that gives and him that takes . ”</p>
   <p>The verses in page [ s 234-7 ] want a title ; nor does the motto , although it gave occasion to them , altogether express the sense of the writer , who meant to observe that some of our best acquisitions , and some of our nobler conquests , are rendered ineffectual , by the passing away of opportunity , and the changes made by time : an argument that such acquirements and moral habits are reserved for a state of being in which they have the uses here denied them .</p>
   <p>In the story of “ Sir Eustace Grey , ” an attempt is made to describe the wanderings of a mind first irritated by the consequences of error and misfortune , and afterwards soothed by a species of enthusiastic conversion , still keeping him insane : a task very difficult , and , if the presumption of the attempt may find pardon , it will not be refused to the failure of the poet . It is said of our Shakspeare , respecting madness ,</p>
   <p>“ In that circle none dare walk but he . ”</p>
   <p>Yet be it granted to one who dares not to pass the boundary fixed for common minds , at least to step near to the tremendous verge , and form some idea of the terrors that are stalking in the interdicted space .</p>
   <p>When first I had written “ Aaron , or The Gipsy , ” I had no unfavourable opinion of it ; and , had I been collecting my verses at that time for publication , I should certainly have included this tale . Nine years have since elapsed , and I continue to judge the same of it , thus literally obeying one of the directions given by the prudence of criticism to the eagerness of the poet ; but how far I may have conformed to rules of more importance must be left to the less partial judgment of the readers .</p>
   <p>The concluding poem , entitled “ Woman ! ” was written at the time when the quotation from Mr. Ledyard was first made public ; the expression has since become hackneyed ; but the sentiment is congenial with our feelings , and though somewhat amplified in these verses , it is hoped they are not so far extended as to become tedious .</p>
   <p>After this brief account of his subjects , the author leaves them to their fate , not presuming to make any remarks upon the kinds of versification he has chosen , or the merit of the execution . He has indeed brought forward the favourable opinion of his friends , and for that he earnestly hopes his motives will be rightly understood ; it was a step of which he felt the advantage while he foresaw the danger ; he was aware of the benefit , if his readers would consider him as one who puts on a defensive armour against hasty and determined severity ; but he feels also the hazard , lest they should suppose he looks upon himself to be guarded by his friends , and so secure in the defence , that he may defy the fair judgment of legal criticism . It will probably be said , “ he has brought with him his testimonials to the bar of the public , ” and he must admit the truth of the remark ; but he begs leave to observe in reply , that of those who bear testimonials of any kind the greater numbers feel apprehension , and not security : they are indeed so far from the enjoyment of victory , of the exultation of triumph , that , with all they can do for themselves , with all their friends have done for them , they are , like him , in dread of examination , and in fear of disappointment .</p>

     <l n="21">When the sad soul , by care and grief oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="22">Looks round the world , but looks in vain for rest ;</l>
     <l n="23">When every object that appears in view ,</l>
     <l n="24">Partakes her gloom and seems dejected too :</l>
     <l n="25">Where shall affliction from itself retire ?</l>
     <l n="26">Where fade away and placidly expire ?</l>
     <l n="27">Alas ! we fly to silent scenes in vain ;</l>
     <l n="28">Care blasts the honours of the flow'ry plain :</l>
     <l n="29">Care veils in clouds the sun 's meridian beam ,</l>
     <l n="30">Sighs through the grove and murmurs in the stream . 10</l>
     <l n="31">For , when the soul is labouring in despair ,</l>
     <l n="32">In vain the body breathes a purer air :</l>
     <l n="33">No storm-toss 'd sailor sighs for slumbering seas —</l>
     <l n="34">He dreads the tempest , but invokes the breeze ;</l>
     <l n="35">On the smooth mirror of the deep resides }</l>
     <l n="36">Reflected wo , and o'er unruffled tides }</l>
     <l n="37">The ghost of every former danger glides . }</l>
     <l n="38">Thus , in the calms of life , we only see</l>
     <l n="39">A steadier image of our misery ;</l>
     <l n="40">But lively gales and gently-clouded skies 20</l>
     <l n="41">Disperse the sad reflections as they rise ;</l>
     <l n="42">And busy thoughts and little cares avail</l>
     <l n="43">To ease the mind , when rest and reason fail .</l>
     <l n="44">When the dull thought , by no designs employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">Dwells on the past , or suffer 'd or enjoy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">We bleed anew in every former grief ,</l>
     <l n="47">And joys departed furnish no relief .</l>
     <l n="48">Not Hope herself , with all her flattering art ,</l>
     <l n="49">Can cure this stubborn sickness of the heart :</l>
     <l n="50">The soul disdains each comfort she prepares , 30</l>
     <l n="51">And anxious searches for congenial cares —</l>
     <l n="52">Those lenient cares , which , with our own combined , }</l>

     <l n="55">A lighter grief ! which feeling hearts endure</l>
     <l n="56">Without regret , nor e'en demand a cure .</l>
     <l n="57">But what strange art , what magic can dispose</l>
     <l n="58">The troubled mind to change its native woes ?</l>
     <l n="59">Or lead us willing from ourselves , to see</l>
     <l n="60">Others more wretched , more undone than we ? 40</l>
     <l n="61">This , books can do — nor this alone : they give</l>
     <l n="62">New views to life , and teach us how to live ;</l>
     <l n="63">They soothe the grieved , the stubborn they chastise ;</l>
     <l n="64">Fools they admonish , and confirm the wise .</l>
     <l n="65">Their aid they yield to all : they never shun</l>
     <l n="66">The man of sorrow , nor the wretch undone ;</l>
     <l n="67">Unlike the hard , the selfish , and the proud ,</l>
     <l n="68">They fly not sullen from the suppliant crowd ;</l>
     <l n="69">Nor tell to various people various things ,</l>
     <l n="70">But show to subjects , what they show to kings . 50</l>
     <l n="71">Come , Child of Care ! to make thy soul serene ,</l>
     <l n="72">Approach the treasures of this tranquil scene ;</l>
     <l n="73">Survey the dome , and , as the doors unfold ,</l>
     <l n="74">The soul 's best cure in all her cares behold !</l>
     <l n="75">Where mental wealth the poor in thought may find ,</l>
     <l n="76">And mental physic the diseased in mind .</l>
     <l n="77">See here the balms that passion 's wounds assuage ;</l>

     <l n="79">Here alt'ratives by slow degrees control</l>
     <l n="80">The chronic habits of the sickly soul ; 60</l>
     <l n="81">And round the heart , and o'er the aching head ,</l>
     <l n="82">Mild opiates here their sober influence shed .</l>
     <l n="83">Now bid thy soul man 's busy scenes exclude ,</l>
     <l n="84">And view composed this silent multitude :—</l>
     <l n="85">Silent they are , but , though deprived of sound ,</l>
     <l n="86">Here all the living languages abound ,</l>
     <l n="87">Here all that live no more ; preserved they lie ,</l>
     <l n="88">In tombs that open to the curious eye .</l>
     <l n="89">Bless 'd be the gracious Power , who taught mankind</l>
     <l n="90">To stamp a lasting image of the mind !— 70</l>
     <l n="91">Beasts may convey , and tuneful birds may sing ,</l>
     <l n="92">Their mutual feelings in the opening spring ;</l>
     <l n="93">But man alone has skill and power to send</l>
     <l n="94">The heart 's warm dictates to the distant friend ;</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Tis his alone to please , instruct , advise</l>
     <l n="96">Ages remote , and nations yet to rise .</l>
     <l n="97">In sweet repose , when labour 's children sleep ,</l>
     <l n="98">When joy forgets to smile and care to weep ,</l>
     <l n="99">When passion slumbers in the lover 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="100">And fear and guilt partake the balm of rest — 80</l>
     <l n="101">Why then denies the studious man to share</l>
     <l n="102">Man 's common good , who feels his common care ?</l>
     <l n="103">Because the hope is his , that bids him fly</l>
     <l n="104">Night 's soft repose , and sleep 's mild power defy ;</l>
     <l n="105">That after-ages may repeat his praise ,</l>
     <l n="106">And fame 's fair meed be his for length of days .</l>
     <l n="107">Delightful prospect ! when we leave behind</l>
     <l n="108">A worthy offspring of the fruitful mind ,</l>
     <l n="109">Which , born and nursed through many an anxious day ,</l>
     <l n="110">Shall all our labour , all our care repay . 90</l>
     <l n="111">Yet all are not these births of noble kind ,</l>
     <l n="112">Not all the children of a vigorous mind ;</l>
     <l n="113">But , where the wisest should alone preside ,</l>
     <l n="114">The weak would rule us , and the blind would guide ;</l>
     <l n="115">Nay , man 's best efforts taste of man , and show</l>
     <l n="116">The poor and troubled source from which they flow :</l>
     <l n="117">Where most he triumphs , we his wants perceive ,</l>
     <l n="118">And for his weakness in his wisdom grieve .</l>
     <l n="119">But , though imperfect all , yet wisdom loves</l>
     <l n="120">This seat serene , and virtue 's self approves ; 100</l>
     <l n="121">Here come the grieved , a change of thought to find ,</l>
     <l n="122">The curious here , to feed a craving mind ;</l>
     <l n="123">Here the devout their peaceful temple choose ;</l>
     <l n="124">And here the poet meets his favouring muse .</l>
     <l n="125">With awe around these silent walks I tread :</l>
     <l n="126">These are the lasting mansions of the dead .—</l>

     <l n="509">Their virtue lost , and of their triumphs vain ,</l>
     <l n="510">Lo ! how they sunk to slavery again ! 490</l>
     <l n="511">Satiate with power , of fame and wealth possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="512">A nation grows too glorious to be bless 'd ;</l>
     <l n="513">Conspicuous made , she stands the mark of all ,</l>
     <l n="514">And foes join foes to triumph in her fall .</l>
     <l n="515">Thus speaks the page that paints ambition 's race ,</l>
     <l n="516">The monarch 's pride , his glory , his disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="517">The headlong course , that madd'ning heroes run ,</l>
     <l n="518">How soon triumphant , and how soon undone ;</l>
     <l n="519">How slaves , turn 'd tyrants , offer crowns to sale ,</l>
     <l n="520">And each fall'n nation 's melancholy tale . 500</l>
     <l n="521">Lo ! where of late the Book of Martyrs stood ,</l>
     <l n="522">Old pious tracts , and Bibles bound in wood :</l>
     <l n="523">There , such the taste of our degenerate age ,</l>
     <l n="524">Stand the profane delusions of the STAGE .</l>
     <l n="525">Yet virtue owns the TRAGIC MUSE a friend —</l>
     <l n="526">Fable her means , morality her end ;</l>
     <l n="527">For this she rules all passions in their turns ,</l>
     <l n="528">And now the bosom bleeds , and now it burns ;</l>
     <l n="529">Pity with weeping eye surveys her bowl ;</l>
     <l n="530">Her anger swells , her terror chills the soul ; 510</l>
     <l n="531">She makes the vile to virtue yield applause ,</l>
     <l n="532">And own her sceptre while they break her laws ;</l>
     <l n="533">For vice in others is abhorr 'd of all ,</l>
     <l n="534">And villains triumph when the worthless fall .</l>
     <l n="535">Not thus her sister COMEDY prevails ,</l>
     <l n="536">Who shoots at folly , for her arrow fails :</l>
     <l n="537">Folly , by dulness arm 'd , eludes the wound ,</l>
     <l n="538">And harmless sees the feather 'd shafts rebound ;</l>
     <l n="539">Unhurt she stands , applauds the archer 's skill ,</l>
     <l n="540">Laughs at her malice , and is folly still . 520</l>
     <l n="541">Yet well the Muse portrays in fancied scenes</l>
     <l n="542">What pride will stoop to , what profession means ;</l>
     <l n="543">How formal fools the farce of state applaud ;</l>
     <l n="544">How caution watches at the lips of fraud ;</l>
     <l n="545">The wordy variance of domestic life ;</l>
     <l n="546">The tyrant husband , the retorting wife ,</l>
     <l n="547">The snares for innocence , the lie of trade ,</l>
     <l n="548">And the smooth tongue 's habitual masquerade .</l>
     <l n="549">With her the virtues too obtain a place ,</l>
     <l n="550">Each gentle passion , each becoming grace ; 530</l>
     <l n="551">The social joy in life 's securer road ,</l>
     <l n="552">Its easy pleasure , its substantial good ;</l>
     <l n="553">The happy thought that conscious virtue gives .</l>
     <l n="554">And all that ought to live , and all that lives .</l>

     <l n="570">Ghosts , fairies , demons , dance before our eyes ; 550</l>

     <l n="577">Away he flies ; and now for bloody deeds ,</l>
     <l n="578">Black suits of armour , masks , and foaming steeds ;</l>
     <l n="579">The giant falls , his recreant throat I seize ,</l>
     <l n="580">And from his corslet take the massy keys ; 560</l>
     <l n="581">Dukes , lords , and knights in long procession move ,</l>
     <l n="582">Released from bondage with my virgin love ;</l>
     <l n="583">She comes ! she comes ! in all the charms of youth ,</l>
     <l n="584">Unequall 'd love and unsuspected truth !</l>
     <l n="585">Ah ! happy he who thus , in magic themes ,</l>
     <l n="586">O'er worlds bewitch 'd in early rapture dreams ,</l>
     <l n="587">Where wild Enchantment waves her potent wand ,</l>

     <l n="591">But lost , for ever lost , to me these joys ,</l>
     <l n="592">Which Reason scatters , and which Time destroys —</l>
     <l n="593">Too dearly bought : maturer judgment calls</l>
     <l n="594">My busied mind from tales and madrigals ;</l>
     <l n="595">My doughty giants all are slain or fled ,</l>

     <l n="600">The church-yard ghost , is now at rest again ; 580</l>
     <l n="601">And all these wayward wanderings of my youth</l>
     <l n="602">Fly Reason 's power and shun the light of truth .</l>
     <l n="603">With fiction , then , does real joy reside ,</l>

     <l n="638">What dangers threaten them — yet still they write :</l>
     <l n="639">A hapless tribe ! to every evil born ,</l>
     <l n="640">Whom villains hate , and fools affect to scorn ; 620</l>
     <l n="641">Strangers they come amid a world of wo ,</l>

     <l n="643">Pensive I spoke , and cast mine eyes around ;</l>
     <l n="644">The roof , methought , return 'd a solemn sound ;</l>
     <l n="645">Each column seem 'd to shake , and clouds , like smoke ,</l>
     <l n="646">From dusty piles and ancient volumes broke ;</l>
     <l n="647">Gathering above , like mists condensed they seem ,</l>
     <l n="648">Exhaled in summer from the rushy stream ;</l>
     <l n="649">Like flowing robes they now appear , and twine</l>
     <l n="650">Round the large members of a form divine ; 630</l>
     <l n="651">His silver beard , that swept his aged breast , }</l>
     <l n="652">His piercing eye , that inward light express 'd , }</l>

     <l n="656">So , in Cimmerian shores , Ulysses saw</l>
     <l n="657">His parent-shade , and shrunk in pious awe ;</l>
     <l n="658">Like him I stood , and wrapt in thought profound ,</l>
     <l n="659">When from the pitying power broke forth a solemn sound :—</l>
     <l n="660">“ Care lives with all ; no rules , no precepts save 640 }</l>
     <l n="661">The wise from wo , no fortitude the brave ; }</l>

     <l n="663">Tempests and storms in life 's whole progress rise ,</l>
     <l n="664">And hope shines dimly through o'erclouded skies ;</l>
     <l n="665">Some drops of comfort on the favour 'd fall ,</l>
     <l n="666">But showers of sorrow are the lot of all :</l>
     <l n="667">Partial to talents , then , shall Heav'n withdraw</l>
     <l n="668">Th ’ afflicting rod , or break the general law ?</l>
     <l n="669">Shall he who soars , inspired by loftier views ,</l>
     <l n="670">Life 's little cares and little pains refuse ? 650</l>
     <l n="671">Shall he not rather feel a double share</l>
     <l n="672">Of mortal wo , when doubly arm 'd to bear ?</l>
     <l n="673">“ Hard is his fate who builds his peace of mind</l>
     <l n="674">On the precarious mercy of mankind ;</l>

     <l n="686">Or virtue bears , or some preserver heals ;</l>
     <l n="687">Some generous friend , of ample power possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="688">Some feeling heart that bleeds for the distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="689">Some breast that glows with virtues all divine ;</l>
     <l n="690">Some noble RUTLAND , Misery 's friend and thine . 670</l>
     <l n="691">“ Nor say , the Muse 's song , the Poet 's pen ,</l>
     <l n="692">Merit the scorn they meet from little men .</l>
     <l n="693">With cautious freedom if the numbers flow ,</l>
     <l n="694">Not wildly high , nor pitifully low ;</l>
     <l n="695">If vice alone their honest aims oppose ,</l>
     <l n="696">Why so ashamed their friends , so loud their foes ?</l>
     <l n="697">Happy for men in every age and clime ,</l>

     <l n="699">Go on then , Son of Vision ! still pursue</l>
     <l n="700">Thy airy dreams ; the world is dreaming too . 680</l>
     <l n="701">Ambition 's lofty views , the pomp of state ,</l>
     <l n="702">The pride of wealth , the splendour of the great ,</l>
     <l n="703">Stripp 'd of their mask , their cares and troubles known ,</l>
     <l n="704">Are visions far less happy than thy own :</l>
     <l n="705">Go on ! and , while the sons of care complain ,</l>
     <l n="706">Be wisely gay and innocently vain ;</l>
     <l n="707">While serious souls are by their fears undone ,</l>
     <l n="708">Blow sportive bladders in the beamy sun ,</l>
     <l n="709">And call them worlds ! and bid the greatest show</l>
     <l n="710">More radiant colours in their worlds below ; 690</l>
     <l n="711">Then , as they break , the slaves of care reprove ,</l>
     <l n="712">And tell them , Such are all the toys they love . ”</l>

    <head>THE VILLAGE .</head>
    <head>IN TWO BOOKS .</head>
    <head>BOOK I .</head>
    <head>The Subject proposed — Remarks upon Pastoral Poetry — A Tract of Country near the Coast described — An impoverished Borough — Smugglers and their Assistants — Rude Manners of the Inhabitants — Ruinous Effects of a high Tide — The Village Life more generally considered : Evils of it — The youthful Labourer — The old Man : his Soliloquy — The Parish Workhouse : its Inhabitants — The sick Poor : their Apothecary — The dying Pauper — The Village Priest .</head>
     <l n="1">The Village Life , and every care that reigns</l>
     <l n="2">O'er youthful peasants and declining swains ;</l>
     <l n="3">What labour yields , and what , that labour past ,</l>
     <l n="4">Age , in its hour of languor , finds at last ;</l>
     <l n="5">What form the real picture of the poor ,</l>
     <l n="6">Demand a song — the Muse can give no more .</l>
     <l n="7">Fled are those times when , in harmonious strains ,</l>
     <l n="8">The rustic poet praised his native plains .</l>
     <l n="9">No shepherds now , in smooth alternate verse ,</l>
     <l n="10">Their country 's beauty or their nymphs ’ rehearse ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Yet still for these we frame the tender strain ,</l>
     <l n="12">Still in our lays fond Corydons complain ,</l>
     <l n="13">And shepherds ’ boys their amorous pains reveal ,</l>
     <l n="14">The only pains , alas ! they never feel .</l>
     <l n="15">On Mincio 's banks , in Caesar 's bounteous reign ,</l>
     <l n="16">If Tityrus found the Golden Age again ,</l>
     <l n="17">Must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong ,</l>
     <l n="18">Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song ?</l>
     <l n="19">From Truth and Nature shall we widely stray ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where Virgil , not where Fancy , leads the way ? 20</l>
     <l n="21">Yes , thus the Muses sing of happy swains ,</l>
     <l n="22">Because the Muses never knew their pains .</l>
     <l n="23">They boast their peasants ’ pipes ; but peasants now</l>
     <l n="24">Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough ;</l>
     <l n="25">And few , amid the rural-tribe , have time</l>
     <l n="26">To number syllables , and play with rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="27">Save honest Duck , what son of verse could share</l>
     <l n="28">The poet 's rapture , and the peasant 's care ?</l>
     <l n="29">Or the great labours of the field degrade ,</l>
     <l n="30">With the new peril of a poorer trade ? 30</l>
     <l n="31">From this chief cause these idle praises spring ,</l>
     <l n="32">That themes so easy few forbear to sing ;</l>
     <l n="33">For no deep thought the trifling subjects ask :</l>
     <l n="34">To sing of shepherds is an easy task .</l>
     <l n="35">The happy youth assumes the common strain ,</l>
     <l n="36">A nymph his mistress , and himself a swain ;</l>
     <l n="37">With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer ,</l>
     <l n="38">But all ; to look like her , is painted fair .</l>
     <l n="39">I grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms</l>
     <l n="40">For him that grazes or for him that farms ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">But , when amid such pleasing scenes I trace</l>
     <l n="42">The poor laborious natives of the place ,</l>
     <l n="43">And see the mid-day sun , with fervid ray ,</l>
     <l n="44">On their bare heads and dewy temples play ;</l>
     <l n="45">While some , with feebler heads and fainter hearts ,</l>
     <l n="46">Deplore their fortune , yet sustain their parts :</l>
     <l n="47">Then shall I dare these real ills to hide</l>
     <l n="48">In tinsel trappings of poetic pride ?</l>
     <l n="49">No ; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast ,</l>
     <l n="50">Which neither groves nor happy valleys boast ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Where other cares than those the Muse relates ,</l>
     <l n="52">And other shepherds dwell with other mates ;</l>
     <l n="53">By such examples taught , I paint the Cot ,</l>
     <l n="54">As Truth will paint it , and as Bards will not :</l>
     <l n="55">Nor you , ye poor , of letter 'd scorn complain ,</l>
     <l n="56">To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain ;</l>
     <l n="57">O'ercome by labour , and bow 'd down by time ,</l>
     <l n="58">Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme ?</l>
     <l n="59">Can poets soothe you , when you pine for bread ,</l>
     <l n="60">By winding myrtles round your ruin 'd shed ? 60</l>
     <l n="61">Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower ,</l>
     <l n="62">Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour ?</l>
     <l n="63">Lo ! where the heath , with withering brake grown o'er ,</l>
     <l n="64">Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor ;</l>
     <l n="65">From thence a length of burning sand appears ,</l>
     <l n="66">Where the thin harvest waves its wither 'd ears ;</l>
     <l n="67">Rank weeds , that every art and care defy ,</l>
     <l n="68">Reign o'er the land , and rob the blighted rye :</l>
     <l n="69">There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar ,</l>
     <l n="70">And to the ragged infant threaten war ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">There poppies , nodding , mock the hope of toil ;</l>
     <l n="72">There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil ;</l>
     <l n="73">Hardy and high , above the slender sheaf ,</l>
     <l n="74">The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf ;</l>
     <l n="75">O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade ,</l>
     <l n="76">And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade ;</l>
     <l n="77">With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound ,</l>
     <l n="78">And a sad splendour vainly shines around .</l>
     <l n="79">So looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn ,</l>
     <l n="80">Betray 'd by man , then left for man to scorn ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose ,</l>
     <l n="82">While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose ;</l>
     <l n="83">Whose outward splendour is but folly 's dress ,</l>
     <l n="84">Exposing most , when most it gilds distress .</l>
     <l n="85">Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race ,</l>
     <l n="86">With sullen wo display 'd in every face ;</l>
     <l n="87">Who far from civil arts and social fly ,</l>
     <l n="88">And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye .</l>
     <l n="89">Here too the lawless merchant of the main</l>
     <l n="90">Draws from his plough th ’ intoxicated swain ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">Want only claim 'd the labour of the day ,</l>
     <l n="92">But vice now steals his nightly rest away .</l>
     <l n="93">Where are the swains , who , daily labour done ,</l>
     <l n="94">With rural games play 'd down the setting sun ;</l>
     <l n="95">Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball ,</l>
     <l n="96">Or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely fall ;</l>
     <l n="97">While some huge Ajax , terrible and strong ,</l>
     <l n="98">Engaged some artful stripling of the throng ,</l>
     <l n="99">And fell beneath him , foil 'd , while far around</l>
     <l n="100">Hoarse triumph rose , and rocks return 'd the sound ? 100</l>
     <l n="101">Where now are these ?— Beneath yon cliff they stand ,</l>
     <l n="102">To show the freighted pinnace where to land ;</l>
     <l n="103">To load the ready steed with guilty haste ;</l>
     <l n="104">To fly in terror o'er the pathless waste ;</l>
     <l n="105">Or , when detected in their straggling course ,</l>
     <l n="106">To foil their foes by cunning or by force ;</l>
     <l n="107">Or , yielding part ( which equal knaves demand ) ,</l>
     <l n="108">To gain a lawless passport through the land .</l>
     <l n="109">Here , wand'ring long amid these frowning fields ,</l>
     <l n="110">I sought the simple life that Nature yields ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurp 'd her place ,</l>
     <l n="112">And a bold , artful , surly , savage race ;</l>
     <l n="113">Who , only skill 'd to take the finny tribe ,</l>
     <l n="114">The yearly dinner , or septennial bribe ,</l>
     <l n="115">Wait on the shore , and , as the waves run high ,</l>
     <l n="116">On the tost vessel bend their eager eye ,</l>
     <l n="117">Which to their coast directs its vent'rous way ;</l>
     <l n="118">[ Their ] , or the ocean 's , miserable prey .</l>
     <l n="119">As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand ,</l>
     <l n="120">And wait for favouring winds to leave the land , 120</l>
     <l n="121">While still for flight the ready wing is spread :</l>
     <l n="122">So waited I the favouring hour , and fled —</l>
     <l n="123">Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign ,</l>
     <l n="124">And cried , Ah ! hapless they who still remain ;</l>
     <l n="125">Who still remain to hear the ocean roar ,</l>
     <l n="126">Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore ;</l>
     <l n="127">Till some fierce tide , with more imperious sway ,</l>
     <l n="128">Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away ;</l>
     <l n="129">When the sad tenant weeps from door to door ,</l>
     <l n="130">And begs a poor protection from the poor ! 130</l>
     <l n="131">But these are scenes where Nature 's niggard hand</l>
     <l n="132">Gave a spare portion to the famish 'd land ;</l>
     <l n="133">Hers is the fault , if here mankind complain</l>
     <l n="134">Of fruitless toil and labour spent in vain .</l>
     <l n="135">But yet in other scenes , more fair in view ,</l>
     <l n="136">Where Plenty smiles — alas ! she smiles for few —</l>
     <l n="137">And those who taste not , yet behold her store , }</l>
     <l n="138">Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore , }</l>
     <l n="139">The wealth around them makes them doubly poor }</l>
     <l n="140">Or will you deem them amply paid in health , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Labour 's fair child , that languishes with wealth ?</l>
     <l n="142">Go , then ! and see them rising with the sun ,</l>
     <l n="143">Through a long course of daily toil to run ;</l>
     <l n="144">See them beneath the dog-star 's raging heat ,</l>
     <l n="145">When the knees tremble and the temples beat ;</l>
     <l n="146">Behold them , leaning on their scythes , look o'er</l>
     <l n="147">The labour past , and toils to come explore ;</l>
     <l n="148">See them alternate suns and showers engage ,</l>
     <l n="149">And hoard up aches and anguish for their age ;</l>
     <l n="150">Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue , 150</l>
     <l n="151">When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew ;</l>
     <l n="152">Then own that labour may as fatal be</l>
     <l n="153">To these thy slaves , as thine excess to thee .</l>
     <l n="154">Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride</l>
     <l n="155">Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide ;</l>
     <l n="156">There may you see the youth of slender frame</l>
     <l n="157">Contend with weakness , weariness , and shame ;</l>
     <l n="158">Yet , urged along , and proudly loth to yield ,</l>
     <l n="159">He strives to join his fellows of the field ;</l>
     <l n="160">Till long-contending nature droops at last , 160</l>
     <l n="161">Declining health rejects his poor repast ,</l>
     <l n="162">His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees ,</l>
     <l n="163">And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease .</l>
     <l n="164">Yet grant them health , ‘ tis not for us to tell ,</l>
     <l n="165">Though the head droops not , that the heart is well ;</l>
     <l n="166">Or will you praise that homely , healthy fare ,</l>
     <l n="167">Plenteous and plain , that happy peasants share ?</l>
     <l n="168">Oh ! trifle not with wants you cannot feel ,</l>
     <l n="169">Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal —</l>
     <l n="170">Homely , not wholesome ; plain , not plenteous ; such 170</l>
     <l n="171">As you who praise would never deign to touch .</l>
     <l n="172">Ye gentle souls , who dream of rural ease ,</l>
     <l n="173">Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please ;</l>
     <l n="174">Go ! if the peaceful cot your praises share ,</l>
     <l n="175">Go , look within , and ask if peace be there :</l>
     <l n="176">If peace be his — that drooping weary sire ,</l>
     <l n="177">Or theirs , that offspring round their feeble fire ;</l>
     <l n="178">Or hers , that matron pale , whose trembling hand</l>
     <l n="179">Turns on the wretched hearth th ’ expiring brand !</l>
     <l n="180">Nor yet can Time itself obtain for these 180</l>
     <l n="181">Life 's latest comforts , due respect and ease :</l>
     <l n="182">For yonder see that hoary swain , whose age</l>
     <l n="183">Can with no cares except his own engage ;</l>
     <l n="184">Who , propp 'd on that rude staff , looks up to see</l>
     <l n="185">The bare arms broken from the withering tree ,</l>
     <l n="186">On which , a boy , he climb 'd the loftiest bough ,</l>
     <l n="187">Then his first joy , but his sad emblem now .</l>
     <l n="188">He once was chief in all the rustic trade ;</l>
     <l n="189">His steady hand the straightest furrow made ;</l>
     <l n="190">Full many a prize he won , and still is proud 190</l>
     <l n="191">To find the triumphs of his youth allow 'd .</l>
     <l n="192">A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="193">He hears and smiles , then thinks again and sighs :</l>
     <l n="194">For now he journeys to his grave in pain ;</l>
     <l n="195">The rich disdain him , nay , the poor disdain ;</l>
     <l n="196">Alternate masters now their slave command ,</l>
     <l n="197">Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand ;</l>

     <l n="200">Oft may you see him , when he tends the sheep , 200</l>
     <l n="201">His winter-charge , beneath the hillock weep ;</l>
     <l n="202">Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow</l>
     <l n="203">O'er his white locks and bury them in snow ,</l>
     <l n="204">When , roused by rage and muttering in the morn ,</l>
     <l n="205">He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn :—</l>
     <l n="206">“ Why do I live , when I desire to be</l>
     <l n="207">At once from life and life 's long labour free ?</l>
     <l n="208">Like leaves in spring , the young are blown away ,</l>
     <l n="209">Without the sorrows of a slow decay ;</l>
     <l n="210">I , like yon wither 'd leaf , remain behind , 210</l>
     <l n="211">Nipp 'd by the frost , and shivering in the wind ;</l>

     <l n="218">To me the children of my youth are lords ,</l>
     <l n="219">Cool in their looks , but hasty in their words :</l>

     <l n="223">None need my help , and none relieve my wo ;</l>

     <l n="229">Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door ;</l>
     <l n="230">There , where the putrid vapours , flagging , play , 230</l>
     <l n="231">And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day —</l>
     <l n="232">There children dwell , who know no parents ’ care ;</l>
     <l n="233">Parents , who know no children 's love , dwell there !</l>
     <l n="234">Heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed ,</l>
     <l n="235">Forsaken wives , and mothers never wed ;</l>
     <l n="236">Dejected widows with unheeded tears ,</l>
     <l n="237">And crippled age with more than childhood fears ;</l>
     <l n="238">The lame , the blind , and , far the happiest they !</l>
     <l n="239">The moping idiot and the madman gay .</l>
     <l n="240">Here too the sick their final doom receive , 240</l>
     <l n="241">Here brought , amid the scenes of grief , to grieve ,</l>
     <l n="242">Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow ,</l>
     <l n="243">Mix 'd with the clamours of the crowd below ;</l>
     <l n="244">Here , sorrowing , they each kindred sorrow scan ,</l>
     <l n="245">And the cold charities of man to man :</l>
     <l n="246">Whose laws indeed for ruin 'd age provide ,</l>
     <l n="247">And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride ;</l>
     <l n="248">But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="249">And pride embitters what it can n't deny .</l>
     <l n="250">Say ye , oppress 'd by some fantastic woes , 250</l>
     <l n="251">Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose ;</l>
     <l n="252">Who press the downy couch , while slaves advance</l>
     <l n="253">With timid eye to read the distant glance ;</l>
     <l n="254">Who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease ,</l>
     <l n="255">To name the nameless ever-new disease ;</l>
     <l n="256">Who with mock patience dire complaints endure ,</l>
     <l n="257">Which real pain , and that alone , can cure —</l>
     <l n="258">How would ye bear in real pain to lie ,</l>
     <l n="259">Despised , neglected , left alone to die ?</l>
     <l n="260">How would ye bear to draw your latest breath , 260</l>
     <l n="261">Where all that 's wretched paves the way for death ?</l>
     <l n="262">Such is that room which one rude beam divides ,</l>
     <l n="263">And naked rafters form the sloping sides ;</l>
     <l n="264">Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen ,</l>
     <l n="265">And lath and mud are all that lie between ,</l>
     <l n="266">Save one dull pane , that , coarsely patch 'd , gives way</l>
     <l n="267">To the rude tempest , yet excludes the day .</l>
     <l n="268">Here , on a matted flock , with dust o'erspread ,</l>
     <l n="269">The drooping wretch reclines his languid head ;</l>
     <l n="270">For him no hand the cordial cup applies , 270</l>
     <l n="271">Or wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="272">No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile ,</l>
     <l n="273">Or promise hope till sickness wears a smile .</l>
     <l n="274">But soon a loud and hasty summons calls ,</l>
     <l n="275">Shakes the thin roof , and echoes round the walls .</l>
     <l n="276">Anon , a figure enters , quaintly neat ,</l>
     <l n="277">All pride and business , bustle and conceit ;</l>
     <l n="278">With looks unalter 'd by these scenes of wo ,</l>
     <l n="279">With speed that , entering , speaks his haste to go ,</l>
     <l n="280">He bids the gazing throng around him fly , 280</l>
     <l n="281">And carries fate and physic in his eye :</l>
     <l n="282">A potent quack , long versed in human ills ,</l>
     <l n="283">Who first insults the victim whom he kills ;</l>
     <l n="284">Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy Bench protect .</l>
     <l n="285">And whose most tender mercy is neglect .</l>
     <l n="286">Paid by the parish for attendance here ,</l>
     <l n="287">He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer ;</l>
     <l n="288">In haste he seeks the bed where Misery lies ,</l>
     <l n="289">Impatience mark 'd in his averted eyes ;</l>
     <l n="290">And , some habitual queries hurried o'er , 290</l>
     <l n="291">Without reply , he rushes on the door .</l>
     <l n="292">His drooping patient , long inured to pain ,</l>
     <l n="293">And long unheeded , knows remonstrance vain ;</l>
     <l n="294">He ceases now the feeble help to crave</l>
     <l n="295">Of man ; and silent sinks into the grave .</l>
     <l n="296">But ere his death some pious doubts arise ,</l>
     <l n="297">Some simple fears , which “ bold bad ” men despise :</l>
     <l n="298">Fain would he ask the parish-priest to prove</l>
     <l n="299">His title certain to the joys above ;</l>
     <l n="300">For this he sends the murmuring nurse , who calls 300</l>
     <l n="301">The holy stranger to these dismal walls ;</l>
     <l n="302">And doth not he , the pious man , appear ,</l>
     <l n="303">He , “ passing rich with forty pounds a year ” ?</l>
     <l n="304">Ah ! no ; a shepherd of a different stock ,</l>
     <l n="305">And far unlike him , feeds this little flock :</l>
     <l n="306">A jovial youth , who thinks his Sunday 's task</l>
     <l n="307">As much as God or man can fairly ask ;</l>
     <l n="308">The rest he gives to loves and labours light ,</l>
     <l n="309">To fields the morning , and to feasts the night ;</l>
     <l n="310">None better skill 'd the noisy pack to guide , 310</l>
     <l n="311">To urge their chase , to cheer them or to chide ;</l>
     <l n="312">A sportsman keen , he shoots through half the day ,</l>
     <l n="313">And , skill 'd at whist , devotes the night to play .</l>
     <l n="314">Then , while such honours bloom around his head ,</l>
     <l n="315">Shall he sit sadly by the sick man 's bed ,</l>
     <l n="316">To raise the hope he feels not , or with zeal</l>
     <l n="317">To combat fears that e'en the pious feel ?</l>
     <l n="318">Now once again the gloomy scene explore , }</l>
     <l n="319">Less gloomy now ; the bitter hour is o'er , }</l>
     <l n="320">The man of many sorrows sighs no more .— 320 }</l>
     <l n="321">Up yonder hill , behold how sadly slow</l>
     <l n="322">The bier moves winding from the vale below ;</l>
     <l n="323">There lie the happy dead , from trouble free ,</l>
     <l n="324">And the glad parish pays the frugal fee .</l>
     <l n="325">No more , O Death ! thy victim starts to hear</l>
     <l n="326">Churchwarden stern , or kingly overseer ;</l>
     <l n="327">No more the farmer claims his humble bow ,</l>
     <l n="328">Thou art his lord , the best of tyrants thou !</l>
     <l n="329">Now to the church behold the mourners come ,</l>
     <l n="330">Sedately torpid and devoutly dumb ; 330</l>
     <l n="331">The village children now their games suspend ,</l>
     <l n="332">To see the bier that bears their ancient friend :</l>
     <l n="333">For he was one in all their idle sport ,</l>
     <l n="334">And like a monarch ruled their little court ;</l>
     <l n="335">The pliant bow he form 'd , the flying ball ,</l>
     <l n="336">The bat , the wicket , were his labours all ;</l>
     <l n="337">Him now they follow to his grave , and stand</l>
     <l n="338">Silent and sad , and gazing , hand in hand ;</l>
     <l n="339">While bending low , their eager eyes explore</l>
     <l n="340">The mingled relics of the parish poor . 340</l>
     <l n="341">The bell tolls late , the moping owl flies round ,</l>

     <l n="28">Thus , as their hours glide on , with pleasure fraught ,</l>
     <l n="29">Their careful masters brood the painful thought ; 20</l>
     <l n="30">Much in their mind they murmur and lament ,</l>
     <l n="31">That one fair day should be so idly spent ;</l>
     <l n="32">And think that Heaven deals hard , to tithe their store</l>
     <l n="33">And tax their time for preachers and the poor .</l>
     <l n="34">Yet still , ye humbler friends , enjoy your hour ,</l>
     <l n="35">This is your portion , yet unclaim 'd of power ;</l>
     <l n="36">This is Heaven 's gift to weary men oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="37">And seems the type of their expected rest .</l>
     <l n="38">But yours , alas ! are joys that soon decay ;</l>
     <l n="39">Frail joys , begun and ended with the day ; 30</l>
     <l n="40">Or yet , while day permits those joys to reign ,</l>
     <l n="41">The village vices drive them from the plain .</l>
     <l n="42">See the stout churl , in drunken fury great ,</l>
     <l n="43">Strike the bare bosom of his teeming mate !</l>
     <l n="44">His naked vices , rude and unrefined ,</l>
     <l n="45">Exert their open empire o'er the mind ;</l>
     <l n="46">But can we less the senseless rage despise ,</l>
     <l n="47">Because the savage acts without disguise ?</l>
     <l n="48">Yet here disguise , the city 's vice , is seen ,</l>
     <l n="49">And Slander steals along and taints the Green : 40</l>
     <l n="50">At her approach domestic peace is gone ,</l>
     <l n="51">Domestic broils at her approach come on ;</l>
     <l n="52">She to the wife the husband 's crime conveys ,</l>
     <l n="53">She tells the husband when his consort strays ,</l>
     <l n="54">Her busy tongue through all the little state</l>
     <l n="55">Diffuses doubt , suspicion , and debate ;</l>
     <l n="56">Peace , tim'rous goddess ! quits her old domain ,</l>
     <l n="57">In sentiment and song content to reign .</l>
     <l n="58">Nor are the nymphs that breathe the rural air</l>
     <l n="59">So fair as Cynthia 's , nor so chaste as fair : 50</l>
     <l n="60">These to the town afford each fresher face ,</l>
     <l n="61">And the clown 's trull receives the peer 's embrace ;</l>
     <l n="62">From whom , should chance again convey her down ,</l>
     <l n="63">The peer 's disease in turn attacks the clown .</l>
     <l n="64">Here too the ‘ squire , or ‘ squire-like farmer , talk ,</l>
     <l n="65">How round their regions nightly pilferers walk ;</l>
     <l n="66">How from their ponds the fish are borne , and all</l>
     <l n="67">The rip'ning treasures from their lofty wall ;</l>
     <l n="68">How meaner rivals in their sports delight ,</l>
     <l n="69">Just rich enough to claim a doubtful right ; 60</l>
     <l n="70">Who take a licence round their fields to stray ,</l>
     <l n="71">A mongrel race ! the poachers of the day .</l>
     <l n="72">And hark ! the riots of the Green begin ,</l>
     <l n="73">That sprang at first from yonder noisy inn ;</l>
     <l n="74">What time the weekly pay was vanish 'd all ,</l>
     <l n="75">And the slow hostess scored the threatening wall ;</l>
     <l n="76">What time they ask 'd , their friendly feast to close ,</l>
     <l n="77">A final cup , and that will make them foes ;</l>
     <l n="78">When blows ensue that break the arm of toil ,</l>
     <l n="79">And rustic battle ends the boobies ’ broil . 70</l>
     <l n="80">Save when to yonder Hall they bend their way ,</l>
     <l n="81">Where the grave justice ends the grievous fray ;</l>
     <l n="82">He who recites , to keep the poor in awe ,</l>
     <l n="83">The law 's vast volume — for he knows the law :—</l>
     <l n="84">To him with anger or with shame repair</l>
     <l n="85">The injured peasant and deluded fair .</l>
     <l n="86">Lo ! at his throne the silent nymph appears ,</l>
     <l n="87">Frail by her shape , but modest in her tears ;</l>
     <l n="88">And while she stands abash 'd , with conscious eye ,</l>
     <l n="89">Some favourite female of her judge glides by , 80</l>
     <l n="90">Who views with scornful glance the strumpet 's fate ,</l>
     <l n="91">And thanks the stars that made her keeper great ;</l>
     <l n="92">Near her the swain , about to bear for life</l>
     <l n="93">One certain evil , doubts ‘ twixt war and wife ;</l>
     <l n="94">But , while the falt'ring damsel takes her oath ,</l>
     <l n="95">Consents to wed , and so secures them both .</l>
     <l n="96">Yet , why , you ask , these humble crimes relate ,</l>
     <l n="97">Why make the poor as guilty as the great ?</l>
     <l n="98">To show the great , those mightier sons of pride ,</l>
     <l n="99">How near in vice the lowest are allied ; 90</l>
     <l n="100">Such are their natures and their passions such ,</l>
     <l n="101">But these disguise too little , those too much :</l>
     <l n="102">So shall the man of power and pleasure see</l>
     <l n="103">In his own slave as vile a wretch as he ;</l>
     <l n="104">In his luxurious lord the servant find</l>
     <l n="105">His own low pleasures and degenerate mind :</l>
     <l n="106">And each in all the kindred vices trace</l>
     <l n="107">Of a poor , blind , bewilder 'd , erring race ;</l>
     <l n="108">Who , a short time in varied fortune past ,</l>
     <l n="109">Die , and are equal in the dust at last . 100</l>
     <l n="110">And you , ye poor , who still lament your fate ,</l>
     <l n="111">Forbear to envy those you call the great ;</l>
     <l n="112">And know , amid those blessings they possess ,</l>
     <l n="113">They are , like you , the victims of distress ;</l>
     <l n="114">While sloth with many a pang torments her slave ,</l>
     <l n="115">Fear waits on guilt , and danger shakes the brave .</l>
     <l n="116">Oh ! if in life one noble chief appears ,</l>
     <l n="117">Great in his name , while blooming in his years ;</l>
     <l n="118">Born to enjoy whate'er delights mankind ,</l>
     <l n="119">And yet to all you feel or fear resign 'd ; 110</l>
     <l n="120">Who gave up joys and hopes , to you unknown ,</l>
     <l n="121">For pains and dangers greater than your own :</l>
     <l n="122">If such there be , then let your murmurs cease ,</l>
     <l n="123">Think , think of him , and take your lot in peace .</l>
     <l n="124">And such there was :— Oh ! grief , that checks our pride !</l>
     <l n="125">Weeping we say , there was — for Manners died :</l>

     <l n="188">The noble spirit , that , in dangers brave ,</l>
     <l n="189">Calmly looks on , or looks beyond the grave :— 180</l>
     <l n="190">Such Manners was , so he resign 'd his breath ,</l>
     <l n="191">If in a glorious , then a timely death .</l>
     <l n="192">Cease then that grief , and let those tears subside ;</l>

     <l n="201">Grief is a foe ; expel him , then , thy soul ;</l>

     <l n="205">And , as thy thoughts through streaming ages glide ,</l>
     <l n="206">See other heroes die as Manners died :</l>
     <l n="207">And , from their fate , thy race shall nobler grow ,</l>
     <l n="208">As trees shoot upwards that are pruned below ;</l>
     <l n="209">Or as old Thames , borne down with decent pride , 200</l>
     <l n="210">Sees his young streams run warbling at his side ;</l>
     <l n="211">Though some , by art cut off , no longer run ,</l>
     <l n="212">And some are lost beneath the summer 's sun —</l>
     <l n="213">Yet the pure stream moves on , and , as it moves ,</l>
     <l n="214">Its power increases and its use improves ;</l>
     <l n="215">While plenty round its spacious waves bestow ,</l>
     <l n="216">Still it flows on , and shall for ever flow .</l>

   <p>Some apology is due for the insertion of a circumstance by no means common : that it has been a subject for complaint in any place is a sufficient reason for its being reckoned among the evils which may happen to the poor , and which must happen to them exclusively ; nevertheless , it is just to remark , that such neglect is very rare in any part of the kingdom , and in many parts is totally unknown .</p>

   <p>Lord Robert Manners , the youngest son of the Marquis of Granby and the Lady Frances Seymour , daughter of Charles Duke of Somerset , was born the 5th of February , 1758 ; and was placed with his brother , the late Duke of Rutland , at Eton school , where he acquired , and ever after retained , a considerable knowledge of the classical authors .</p>
   <p>Lord Robert , after going through the duties of his profession on board different ships , was made captain of the Resolution , and commanded her in nine different actions , besides the last memorable one on the 2nd of April , 1782 , when , in breaking the French line of battle , he received the wounds which terminated his life , in the twenty-fourth year of his age .— See the Annual Register , printed for Mr. Dodsley .</p>

   <p>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE</p>
   <p>EDWARD LORD THURLOW ,</p>
   <p>LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF GREAT BRITAIN ; ONE OF HIS MAJESTY 'S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL , ETC . ETC .</p>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>My obligations to your Lordship , great as they are , have not induced me to prefix your name to the following Poem ; nor is it your Lordship 's station , exalted as that is , which prevailed upon me to solicit the honour of your protection for it . But , when I considered your Lordship 's great abilities and good taste , so well known and so universally acknowledged , I became anxious for the privilege with which you have indulged me ; well knowing that the Public would not be easily persuaded to disregard a performance , marked , in any degree , with your Lordship 's approbation .</p>
   <p>It is , my Lord , the province of superior rank , in general , to bestow this kind of patronage ; but superior talents only can render it valuable . Of the value of your Lordship 's I am fully sensible ; and , while I make my acknowledgments for that , and for many other favours , I cannot suppress the pride I have in thus publishing my gratitude , and declaring how much I have the honour to be ,</p>

     <l n="2">February 20th , 1785 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>TO THE READER .</p>
   <p>The Poem which I now offer to the Public , is , I believe , the only one written on the subject ; at least , it is the only one which I have any knowledge of ; and , fearing there may not be found in it many things to engage the Reader 's attention , I am willing to take the strongest hold I can upon him , by offering something which has the claim of novelty .</p>
   <p>When the subject first occurred to me , I meant , in a few lines only , to give some description of that variety of dissociating articles which are huddled together in our Daily Papers . As the thought dwelt upon me , I conceived this might be done methodically , and with some connection of parts , by taking a larger scope ; which notwithstanding I have done , I must still apologize for a want of union and coherence in my Poem . Subjects like this will not easily admit of them : we cannot slide from theme to theme in an easy and graceful succession ; but , on quitting one thought , there will be an unavoidable hiatus , and in general an awkward transition into that which follows .</p>
   <p>That , in writing upon the subject of our Newspapers , I have avoided every thing which might appear like the opinion of a party , is to be accounted for from the knowledge I have gained from them ; since , the more of these Instructors a man reads , the less he will infallibly understand ; nor would it have been very consistent in me , at the same time to censure their temerity and ignorance , and to adopt their rage .</p>
   <p>I should have been glad to have made some discrimination in my remarks on these productions . There is , indeed , some difference ; and I have observed , that one editor will sometimes convey his abuse with more decency , and colour his falsehood with more appearance of probability , than another : but till I see that paper , wherein no great character is wantonly abused , nor groundless insinuation wilfully disseminated , I shall not make any distinction in my remarks upon them .</p>
   <p>It must , however , be confessed , that these things have their use , and are , besides , vehicles of much amusement ; but this does not outweigh the evil they do to society , and the irreparable injury they bring upon the characters of individuals . In the following Work I have given those good properties their due weight : they have changed indignation into mirth , and turned , what would otherwise have been abhorrence , into derision .</p>

     <l n="70">When kings and queens , dethroned , insulted , tried ,</l>

     <l n="72">There is King Charles , and all his Golden Rules ,</l>

     <l n="120">Not one who slowly gain 'd the hill sublime ,</l>
     <l n="121">Then often sipp 'd and little at a time ; 100</l>
     <l n="122">But one who dabbled in the sacred springs ,</l>

     <l n="139">Jack , by whose arm the giant-brood were quell 'd :</l>
     <l n="140">His shoes of swiftness on his feet he placed ;</l>
     <l n="141">His coat of darkness on his loins he braced ; 120</l>
     <l n="142">His sword of sharpness in his hand he took ,</l>
     <l n="143">And off the heads of doughty giants stroke :</l>
     <l n="144">Their glaring eyes beheld no mortal near ;</l>

     <l n="157">Peers not about , some secret fault to spy ;</l>
     <l n="158">Nor voice severe is there , nor censure known ;—</l>
     <l n="159">Hope , profit , pleasure ,— they are all his own .</l>

     <l n="177">What , though fastidious ears may shun the speech ,</l>
     <l n="178">Where all are talkers and where none can teach ;</l>
     <l n="179">Where still the welcome and the words are old ,</l>
     <l n="180">And the same stories are for ever told —</l>
     <l n="181">Yet theirs is joy that , bursting from the heart , 160</l>
     <l n="182">Prompts the glad tongue these nothings to impart ;</l>
     <l n="183">That forms these tones of gladness we despise ,</l>
     <l n="184">That lifts their steps , that sparkles in their eyes ;</l>
     <l n="185">That talks or laughs or runs or shouts or plays ,</l>
     <l n="186">And speaks in all their looks and all their ways .</l>
     <l n="187">Fair scenes of peace ! ye might detain us long ;</l>
     <l n="188">But vice and misery now demand the song ,</l>
     <l n="189">And turn our view from dwellings simply neat ,</l>
     <l n="190">To this infected row we term our street .</l>
     <l n="191">Here , in cabal , a disputatious crew 170</l>
     <l n="192">Each evening meet : the sot , the cheat , the shrew ;</l>
     <l n="193">Riots are nightly heard — the curse , the cries</l>
     <l n="194">Of beaten wife , perverse in her replies ;</l>
     <l n="195">While shrieking children hold each threat'ning hand ,</l>
     <l n="196">And sometimes life , and sometimes food , demand :</l>
     <l n="197">Boys , in their first-stol'n rags , to swear begin ,</l>
     <l n="198">And girls , who heed not dress , are skill 'd in gin :</l>
     <l n="199">Snarers and smugglers here their gains divide ;</l>
     <l n="200">Ensnaring females here their victims hide ;</l>
     <l n="201">And here is one , the sibyl of the row , 180</l>
     <l n="202">Who knows all secrets , or affects to know .</l>
     <l n="203">Seeking their fate , to her the simple run ,</l>
     <l n="204">To her the guilty , theirs awhile to shun ;</l>
     <l n="205">Mistress of worthless arts , depraved in will ,</l>
     <l n="206">Her care unbless 'd and unrepaid her skill ,</l>
     <l n="207">Slave to the tribe , to whose command she stoops ,</l>
     <l n="208">And poorer than the poorest maid she dupes .</l>
     <l n="209">Between the road-way and the walls , offence</l>
     <l n="210">Invades all eyes and strikes on every sense :</l>
     <l n="211">There lie , obscene , at every open door , 190</l>
     <l n="212">Heaps from the hearth and sweepings from the floor ;</l>
     <l n="213">And day by day the mingled masses grow ,</l>
     <l n="214">As sinks are disembogued and kennels flow .</l>
     <l n="215">There hungry dogs from hungry children steal ;</l>
     <l n="216">There pigs and chickens quarrel for a meal ;</l>
     <l n="217">There dropsied infants wail without redress ,</l>
     <l n="218">And all is want and wo and wretchedness :</l>
     <l n="219">Yet , should these boys , with bodies bronzed and bare ,</l>
     <l n="220">High-swoln and hard , outlive that lack of care ,</l>
     <l n="221">Forced on some farm , the unexerted strength , 200</l>
     <l n="222">Though loth to action , is compell 'd at length ,</l>
     <l n="223">When warm 'd by health , as serpents in the spring</l>
     <l n="224">Aside their slough of indolence they fling .</l>
     <l n="225">Yet , ere they go , a greater evil comes —</l>
     <l n="226">See ! crowded beds in those contiguous rooms ;</l>
     <l n="227">Beds but ill parted by a paltry screen</l>
     <l n="228">Of paper 'd lath or curtain dropp 'd between ;</l>
     <l n="229">Daughters and sons to yon compartments creep ,</l>
     <l n="230">And parents here beside their children sleep .</l>
     <l n="231">Ye who have power , these thoughtless people part , 210</l>
     <l n="232">Nor let the ear be first to taint the heart !</l>
     <l n="233">Come ! search within , nor sight nor smell regard ;</l>
     <l n="234">The true physician walks the foulest ward .</l>
     <l n="235">See ! on the floor what frouzy patches rest !</l>
     <l n="236">What nauseous fragments on yon fractured chest !</l>
     <l n="237">What downy dust beneath yon window-seat !</l>
     <l n="238">And round these posts that serve this bed for feet ;</l>
     <l n="239">This bed , where all those tatter 'd garments lie ,</l>
     <l n="240">Worn by each sex , and now perforce thrown by !</l>
     <l n="241">See ! as we gaze , an infant lifts its head , 220</l>
     <l n="242">Left by neglect and burrow 'd in that bed ;</l>
     <l n="243">The mother-gossip has the love suppress 'd</l>
     <l n="244">An infant 's cry once waken 'd in her breast ;</l>
     <l n="245">And daily prattles , as her round she takes ,</l>
     <l n="246">( With strong resentment ) of the want she makes .</l>
     <l n="247">Whence all these woes ?— From want of virtuous will ,</l>
     <l n="248">Of honest shame , of time-improving skill ;</l>
     <l n="249">From want of care t'employ the vacant hour ,</l>
     <l n="250">And want of ev'ry kind but want of power .</l>
     <l n="251">Here are no wheels for either wool or flax , 230</l>
     <l n="252">But packs of cards — made up of sundry packs ;</l>
     <l n="253">Here is no clock , nor will they turn the glass .</l>
     <l n="254">And see how swift th'important moments pass ;</l>
     <l n="255">Here are no books , but ballads on the wall</l>
     <l n="256">Are some abusive , and indecent all ;</l>
     <l n="257">Pistols are here , unpair 'd ; with nets and hooks ,</l>
     <l n="258">Of every kind , for rivers , ponds , and brooks ;</l>
     <l n="259">An ample flask , that nightly rovers fill</l>
     <l n="260">With recent poison from the Dutchman 's still ;</l>
     <l n="261">A box of tools , with wires of various size , 240 }</l>
     <l n="262">Frocks , wigs , and hats , for night or day disguise , }</l>
     <l n="263">And bludgeons stout to gain or guard a prize . }</l>
     <l n="264">To every house belongs a space of ground ,</l>
     <l n="265">Of equal size , once fenced with paling round ;</l>
     <l n="266">That paling now by slothful waste destroy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="267">Dead gorse and stumps of elder fill the void ,</l>
     <l n="268">Save in the centre-spot , whose walls of clay</l>
     <l n="269">Hide sots and striplings at their drink or play .</l>
     <l n="270">Within , a board , beneath a tiled retreat ,</l>
     <l n="271">Allures the bubble and maintains the cheat ; 250</l>
     <l n="272">Where heavy ale in spots like varnish shows ;</l>
     <l n="273">Where chalky tallies yet remain in rows ;</l>
     <l n="274">Black pipes and broken jugs the seats defile ,</l>
     <l n="275">The walls and windows , rhymes and reck'nings vile ;</l>
     <l n="276">Prints of the meanest kind disgrace the door ,</l>
     <l n="277">And cards , in curses torn , lie fragments on the floor .</l>
     <l n="278">Here his poor bird th'inhuman cocker brings ,</l>
     <l n="279">Arms his hard heel and clips his golden wings ;</l>
     <l n="280">With spicy food th'impatient spirit feeds ,</l>
     <l n="281">And shouts and curses as the battle bleeds . 260</l>
     <l n="282">Struck through the brain , deprived of both his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="283">The vanquish 'd bird must combat till he dies ;</l>
     <l n="284">Must faintly peck at his victorious foe ,</l>
     <l n="285">And reel and stagger at each feeble blow .</l>
     <l n="286">When fall'n , the savage grasps his dabbled plumes ,</l>
     <l n="287">His blood-stain 'd arms , for other deaths assumes ;</l>
     <l n="288">And damns the craven-fowl , that lost his stake ,</l>
     <l n="289">And only bled and perish 'd for his sake .</l>
     <l n="290">Such are our peasants , those to whom we yield</l>
     <l n="291">Praise with relief , the fathers of the field ; 270</l>
     <l n="292">And these who take , from our reluctant hands ,</l>
     <l n="293">What Burn advises or the Bench commands .</l>
     <l n="294">Our farmers round , well pleased with constant gain ,</l>
     <l n="295">Like other farmers , flourish and complain .—</l>
     <l n="296">These are our groups ; our portraits next appear ,</l>

     <l n="298">With evil omen we that year begin :</l>
     <l n="299">A Child of Shame — stern Justice adds , of Sin —</l>
     <l n="300">Is first recorded ; I would hide the deed ,</l>
     <l n="301">But vain the wish ; I sigh and I proceed : 280</l>
     <l n="302">And could I well th ’ instructive truth convey ,</l>
     <l n="303">‘ Twould warn the giddy and awake the gay .</l>
     <l n="304">Of all the nymphs who gave our village grace ,</l>
     <l n="305">The Miller 's daughter had the fairest face .</l>
     <l n="306">Proud was the Miller ; money was his pride ;</l>
     <l n="307">He rode to market , as our farmers ride ;</l>
     <l n="308">And ‘ twas his boast , inspired by spirits , there ,</l>
     <l n="309">His favourite Lucy should be rich as fair ;</l>
     <l n="310">But she must meek and still obedient prove ,</l>
     <l n="311">And not presume , without his leave , to love . 290</l>
     <l n="312">A youthful Sailor heard him ;— “ Ha ! ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="313">“ This Miller 's maiden is a prize for me ;</l>
     <l n="314">Her charms I love , his riches I desire ,</l>
     <l n="315">And all his threats but fan the kindling fire ;</l>
     <l n="316">My ebbing purse no more the foe shall fill ,</l>
     <l n="317">But Love 's kind act and Lucy at the mill . ”</l>
     <l n="318">Thus thought the youth , and soon the chase began ,</l>
     <l n="319">Stretch 'd all his sail , nor thought of pause or plan :</l>
     <l n="320">His trusty staff in his bold hand he took ,</l>
     <l n="321">Like him and like his frigate , heart of oak ; 300</l>
     <l n="322">Fresh were his features , his attire was new ;</l>
     <l n="323">Clean was his linen , and his jacket blue :</l>
     <l n="324">Of finest jean , his trowsers , tight and trim ,</l>
     <l n="325">Brush 'd the large buckle at the silver rim .</l>
     <l n="326">He soon arrived , he traced the village-green ;</l>
     <l n="327">There saw the maid , and was with pleasure seen ;</l>
     <l n="328">Then talk 'd of love , till Lucy 's yielding heart</l>
     <l n="329">Confess 'd ‘ twas painful , though ‘ twas right , to part .</l>
     <l n="330">“ For ah ! my father has a haughty soul ;</l>
     <l n="331">Whom best he loves , he loves but to control ; 310</l>
     <l n="332">Me to some churl in bargain he 'll consign ,</l>
     <l n="333">And make some tyrant of the parish mine :</l>
     <l n="334">Cold is his heart , and he with looks severe</l>
     <l n="335">Has often forced but never shed the tear ;</l>
     <l n="336">Save , when my mother died , some drops express 'd</l>
     <l n="337">A kind of sorrow for a wife at rest .—</l>
     <l n="338">To me a master 's stern regard is shown ,</l>
     <l n="339">I 'm like his steed , prized highly as his own ;</l>
     <l n="340">Stroked but corrected , threaten 'd when supplied ,</l>
     <l n="341">His slave and boast , his victim and his pride . ” 320</l>
     <l n="342">“ Cheer up , my lass ! I 'll to thy father go —</l>

     <l n="624">Her idle neighbours , who approach to tell</l>
     <l n="625">Some trifling tale , her serious looks compel ,</l>
     <l n="626">To hear reluctant — while the lads who pass ,</l>
     <l n="627">In pure respect walk silent on the grass .</l>
     <l n="628">Then sinks the day ; but not to rest she goes ,</l>
     <l n="629">Till solemn prayers the daily duties close .</l>
     <l n="630">But I digress , and lo ! an infant train</l>
     <l n="631">Appear , and call me to my task again . 610</l>
     <l n="632">“ Why Lonicera wilt thou name thy child ? ”</l>
     <l n="633">I ask 'd the Gardener 's wife , in accents mild .</l>
     <l n="634">“ We have a right , ” replied the sturdy dame —</l>
     <l n="635">And Lonicera was the infant 's name .</l>
     <l n="636">If next a son shall yield our Gardener joy ,</l>
     <l n="637">Then Hyacinthus shall be that fair boy ;</l>
     <l n="638">And if a girl , they will at length agree ,</l>
     <l n="639">That Belladonna that fair maid shall be .</l>
     <l n="640">High-sounding words our worthy Gardener gets ,</l>
     <l n="641">And at his club to wondering swains repeats ; 620</l>
     <l n="642">He then of Rhus and Rhododendron speaks ,</l>
     <l n="643">And Allium calls his onions and his leeks ;</l>
     <l n="644">Nor weeds are now , for whence arose the weed ,</l>
     <l n="645">Scarce plants , fair herbs , and curious flowers proceed ;</l>
     <l n="646">Where Cuckoo-pints and Dandelions sprung ,</l>
     <l n="647">( Gross names had they our plainer sires among ,)</l>
     <l n="648">There Arums , there Leontodons we view ,</l>
     <l n="649">And Artemisia grows , where Wormwood grew .</l>
     <l n="650">But though no weed exists his garden round ,</l>
     <l n="651">From Rumex strong our Gardener frees his ground ; 630</l>
     <l n="652">Takes soft Senicio from the yielding land ,</l>
     <l n="653">And grasps the arm 'd Urtica in his hand .</l>
     <l n="654">Not Darwin 's self had more delight to sing</l>
     <l n="655">Of floral courtship , in th ’ awaken 'd Spring ,</l>
     <l n="656">Than Peter Pratt , who , simpering , loves to tell</l>
     <l n="657">How rise the Stamens , as the Pistils swell ;</l>
     <l n="658">How bend and curl the moist-top to the spouse ,</l>
     <l n="659">And give and take the vegetable vows ;</l>
     <l n="660">How those esteem 'd of old but tips and chives ,</l>
     <l n="661">Are tender husbands and obedient wives ; 640</l>
     <l n="662">Who live and love within the sacred bower —</l>
     <l n="663">That bridal bed the vulgar term a flower .</l>
     <l n="664">Hear Peter proudly , to some humble friend ,</l>
     <l n="665">A wondrous secret in his science lend :—</l>
     <l n="666">“ Would you advance the nuptial hour , and bring</l>
     <l n="667">The fruit of Autumn with the flowers of Spring :</l>
     <l n="668">View that light frame where Cucumis lies spread ,</l>

     <l n="672">Then by thyself , from prying glance secure ,</l>
     <l n="673">Twirl the full tip and make your purpose sure ;</l>
     <l n="674">A long-abiding race the deed shall pay ,</l>
     <l n="675">Nor one unbless 'd abortion pine away . ”</l>
     <l n="676">T ’ admire their friend 's discourse our swains agree ,</l>
     <l n="677">And call it science and philosophy .</l>
     <l n="678">‘ Tis good , ‘ tis pleasant , through th ’ advancing year ,</l>

     <l n="691">No ! let us rather seek , in grove and field , 670</l>

     <l n="713">Some harden 'd knaves , who roved the country round ,</l>
     <l n="714">Had left a babe within the parish-bound .—</l>
     <l n="715">First , of the fact they question 'd — “ Was it true ? ”</l>
     <l n="716">The child was brought — “ What then remain 'd to do ?</l>
     <l n="717">Was't dead or living ? ” This was fairly proved :</l>
     <l n="718">‘ Twas pinch 'd , it roar 'd , and every doubt removed .</l>
     <l n="719">Then by what name th ’ unwelcome guest to call</l>
     <l n="720">Was long a question , and it posed them all ;</l>
     <l n="721">For he who lent it to a babe unknown , 700</l>
     <l n="722">Censorious men might take it for his own :</l>
     <l n="723">They look 'd about , they gravely spoke to all ,</l>
     <l n="724">And not one Richard answer 'd to the call .</l>
     <l n="725">Next they inquired the day , when , passing by ,</l>

     <l n="727">This known , how food and raiment they might give ,</l>
     <l n="728">Was next debated — for the rogue would live ;</l>

     <l n="730">Back to their homes the prudent vestry went , }</l>
     <l n="731">And Richard Monday to the workhouse sent . 710 }</l>
     <l n="732">There was he pinch 'd and pitied , thump 'd and fed ,</l>
     <l n="733">And duly took his beatings and his bread ;</l>
     <l n="734">Patient in all control , in all abuse ,</l>
     <l n="735">He found contempt and kicking have their use —</l>
     <l n="736">Sad , silent , supple , bending to the blow ,</l>
     <l n="737">A slave of slaves , the lowest of the low ;</l>
     <l n="738">His pliant soul gave way to all things base ;</l>
     <l n="739">He knew no shame , he dreaded no disgrace .</l>
     <l n="740">It seem 'd , so well his passions he suppressed ,</l>
     <l n="741">No feeling stirr 'd his ever-torpid breast ; 720</l>
     <l n="742">Him might the meanest pauper bruise and cheat ,</l>
     <l n="743">He was a footstool for the beggar 's feet ;</l>

     <l n="745">They used on all occasions Richard 's hands .</l>
     <l n="746">His very soul was not his own ; he stole</l>
     <l n="747">As others order 'd , and without a dole ;</l>
     <l n="748">In all disputes , on either part he lied ,</l>
     <l n="749">And freely pledged his oath on either side ;</l>
     <l n="750">In all rebellions Richard join 'd the rest ,</l>
     <l n="751">In all detections Richard first confess 'd . 730</l>
     <l n="752">Yet , though disgraced , he watch 'd his time so well ,</l>
     <l n="753">He rose in favour , when in fame he fell ;</l>
     <l n="754">Base was his usage , vile his whole employ ,</l>
     <l n="755">And all despised and fed the pliant boy .</l>
     <l n="756">At length , “ ‘ tis time he should abroad be sent , ”</l>
     <l n="757">Was whisper 'd near him — and abroad he went .</l>
     <l n="758">One morn they call 'd him , Richard answered not ;</l>

     <l n="760">Yet miss 'd him long , as each , throughout the clan ,</l>
     <l n="761">Found he “ had better spared a better man . ” 740</l>
     <l n="762">Now Richard 's talents for the world were fit ,</l>
     <l n="763">He 'd no small cunning , and had some small wit ;</l>
     <l n="764">Had that calm look which seem 'd to all assent ,</l>
     <l n="765">And that complacent speech which nothing meant ;</l>
     <l n="766">He 'd but one care , and that he strove to hide ,</l>
     <l n="767">How best for Richard Monday to provide .</l>
     <l n="768">Steel , through opposing plates , the magnet draws ,</l>
     <l n="769">And steely atoms culls from dust and straws ;</l>
     <l n="770">And thus our hero , to his interest true ,</l>
     <l n="771">Gold through all bars and from each trifle drew ; 750</l>
     <l n="772">But , still more surely round the world to go ,</l>
     <l n="773">This fortune 's child had neither friend nor foe .</l>
     <l n="774">Long lost to us , at last our man we trace —</l>
     <l n="775">Sir Richard Monday died at Monday-place .</l>
     <l n="776">His lady 's worth , his daughter 's , we peruse ,</l>
     <l n="777">And find his grandsons all as rich as Jews ;</l>
     <l n="778">He gave reforming charities a sum ,</l>

     <l n="780">Bequeathed to missions money from the stocks ,</l>
     <l n="781">And Bibles issued from his private box ; 760</l>
     <l n="782">But , to his native place severely just ,</l>
     <l n="783">He left a pittance bound in rigid trust —</l>

     <l n="790">Twice in this year a female Giles I see :</l>
     <l n="791">A Spalding once , and once a Barnaby — 770</l>
     <l n="792">A humble man is he , and , when they meet ,</l>
     <l n="793">Our farmers find him on a distant seat ;</l>
     <l n="794">There for their wit he serves a constant theme —</l>
     <l n="795">They praise his dairy , they extol his team ,</l>
     <l n="796">They ask the price of each unrivall 'd steed .</l>
     <l n="797">And whence his sheep , that admirable breed ?</l>
     <l n="798">His thriving arts they beg he would explain ,</l>
     <l n="799">And where he puts the money he must gain .</l>
     <l n="800">They have their daughters , but they fear their friend</l>
     <l n="801">Would think his sons too much would condescend ; 780</l>
     <l n="802">They have their sons who would their fortunes try ,</l>
     <l n="803">But fear his daughters will their suit deny .</l>
     <l n="804">So runs the joke , while James , with sigh profound ,</l>
     <l n="805">And face of care , looks moveless on the ground ;</l>
     <l n="806">His cares , his sighs , provoke the insult more ,</l>

     <l n="344">Stephen , meantime , to ease his amorous cares ,</l>

     <l n="346">Two pigs , a cow , and wethers half a score ,</l>

     <l n="413">Next to these ladies , but in nought allied ,</l>
     <l n="414">A noble Peasant , Isaac Ashford , died .</l>

     <l n="416">His truth unquestion 'd and his soul serene ;</l>
     <l n="417">Of no man 's presence Isaac felt afraid ;</l>
     <l n="418">At no man 's question Isaac look 'd dismay 'd :</l>
     <l n="419">Shame knew him not , he dreaded no disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="420">Truth , simple truth , was written in his face ; 420</l>
     <l n="421">Yet while the serious thought his soul approved ,</l>
     <l n="422">Cheerful he seem 'd , and gentleness he loved .</l>
     <l n="423">To bliss domestic he his heart resign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="424">And , with the firmest , had the fondest mind .</l>
     <l n="425">Were others joyful , he look 'd smiling on ,</l>
     <l n="426">And gave allowance where he needed none ;</l>
     <l n="427">Good he refused with future ill to buy ,</l>
     <l n="428">Nor knew a joy that caused reflection 's sigh ;</l>
     <l n="429">A friend to virtue , his unclouded breast</l>
     <l n="430">No envy stung , no jealousy distress 'd ; 430</l>
     <l n="431">( Bane of the poor ! it wounds their weaker mind ,</l>
     <l n="432">To miss one favour which their neighbours find . )</l>
     <l n="433">Yet far was he from stoic pride removed ;</l>
     <l n="434">He felt humanely , and he warmly loved .</l>
     <l n="435">I mark 'd his action , when his infant died ,</l>
     <l n="436">And his old neighbour for offence was tried ;</l>
     <l n="437">The still tears , stealing down that furrow 'd cheek ,</l>
     <l n="438">Spoke pity , plainer than the tongue can speak .</l>
     <l n="439">If pride were his , ‘ twas not their vulgar pride ,</l>
     <l n="440">Who , in their base contempt , the great deride ; 440</l>
     <l n="441">Nor pride in learning ,— though my clerk agreed ,</l>
     <l n="442">If fate should call him , Ashford might succeed ;</l>
     <l n="443">Nor pride in rustic skill , although we knew</l>
     <l n="444">None his superior , and his equals few :—</l>
     <l n="445">But , if that spirit in his soul had place ,</l>
     <l n="446">It was the jealous pride that shuns disgrace :</l>
     <l n="447">A pride in honest fame , by virtue gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="448">In sturdy boys to virtuous labours train 'd ;</l>
     <l n="449">Pride in the power that guards his country 's coast ,</l>
     <l n="450">And all that Englishmen enjoy and boast ; 450</l>
     <l n="451">Pride in a life that slander 's tongue defied ,—</l>
     <l n="452">In fact , a noble passion , misnamed pride .</l>
     <l n="453">He had no party 's rage , no sect'ry ' s whim ;</l>
     <l n="454">Christian and countryman was all with him .</l>
     <l n="455">True to his church he came ; no Sunday-shower</l>
     <l n="456">Kept him at home in that important hour ;</l>
     <l n="457">Nor his firm feet could one persuading sect ,</l>
     <l n="458">By the strong glare of their new light , direct ;—</l>
     <l n="459">“ On hope , in mine own sober light , I gaze ,</l>

     <l n="461">In times severe , when many a sturdy swain</l>

     <l n="463">Isaac their wants would soothe , his own would hide ,</l>
     <l n="464">And feel in that his comfort and his pride .</l>
     <l n="465">At length he found , when seventy years were run ,</l>
     <l n="466">His strength departed , and his labour done ;</l>
     <l n="467">When he , save honest fame , retain 'd no more ,</l>
     <l n="468">But lost his wife and saw his children poor :</l>
     <l n="469">‘ Twas then , a spark of — say not , discontent —</l>
     <l n="470">Struck on his mind , and thus he gave it vent : 470</l>
     <l n="471">“ Kind are your laws , ( ‘ tis not to be denied ,)</l>
     <l n="472">That in yon house for ruin 'd age provide ,</l>
     <l n="473">And they are just ;— when young , we give you all ,</l>
     <l n="474">And for assistance in our weakness call .—</l>
     <l n="475">Why then this proud reluctance to be fed ,</l>
     <l n="476">To join your poor , and eat the parish-bread ?</l>
     <l n="477">But yet I linger , loth with him to feed ,</l>
     <l n="478">Who gains his plenty by the sons of need ;</l>
     <l n="479">He who , by contract , all your paupers took ,</l>
     <l n="480">And gauges stomachs with an anxious look . 480</l>
     <l n="481">On some old master I could well depend ;</l>
     <l n="482">See him with joy and thank him as a friend ;</l>
     <l n="483">But ill on him , who doles the day 's supply ,</l>
     <l n="484">And counts our chances , who at night may die :</l>
     <l n="485">Yet help me , Heav'n ! and let me not complain</l>
     <l n="486">Of what I suffer , but my fate sustain . ”</l>
     <l n="487">Such were his thoughts , and so resign 'd he grew ;</l>
     <l n="488">Daily he placed the workhouse in his view !</l>
     <l n="489">But came not there , for sudden was his fate :</l>
     <l n="490">He dropp 'd , expiring , at his cottage-gate . 490</l>
     <l n="491">I feel his absence in the hours of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="492">And view his seat and sigh for Isaac there :</l>
     <l n="493">I see no more those white locks thinly spread</l>
     <l n="494">Round the bald polish of that honoured head ;</l>
     <l n="495">No more that awful glance on playful wight ,</l>
     <l n="496">Compell 'd to kneel and tremble at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="497">To fold his fingers , all in dread the while ,</l>
     <l n="498">Till Mister Ashford soften 'd to a smile ;</l>
     <l n="499">No more that meek and suppliant look in prayer ,</l>
     <l n="500">Nor the pure faith ( to give it force ) , are there ;— 500</l>
     <l n="501">But he is bless 'd , and I lament no more</l>

     <l n="521">To this poor swain a keen Attorney came :—</l>

     <l n="527">The claim was made ; ‘ twas tried — it would not stand ;</l>
     <l n="528">They proved the blood , but were refused the land .</l>
     <l n="529">Assured of wealth , this man of simple heart ,</l>
     <l n="530">To every friend had predisposed a part : 530</l>
     <l n="531">His wife had hopes indulged of various kind ;</l>
     <l n="532">The three Miss Dingleys had their school assign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="533">Masters were sought for what they each required ,</l>
     <l n="534">And books were bought and harpsichords were hired :</l>
     <l n="535">So high was hope ;— the failure touch 'd his brain ,</l>
     <l n="536">And Robin never was himself again .</l>
     <l n="537">Yet he no wrath , no angry wish express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="538">But tried , in vain , to labour or to rest ;</l>
     <l n="539">Then cast his bundle on his back , and went</l>
     <l n="540">He knew not whither , nor for what intent . 540</l>
     <l n="541">Years fled ;— of Robin all remembrance past ,</l>
     <l n="542">When home he wander 'd in his rags at last .</l>
     <l n="543">A sailor 's jacket on his limbs was thrown ,</l>
     <l n="544">A sailor 's story he had made his own ;</l>
     <l n="545">Had suffer 'd battles , prisons , tempests , storms ,</l>
     <l n="546">Encountering death in all his ugliest forms .</l>
     <l n="547">His cheeks were haggard , hollow was his eye ,</l>
     <l n="548">Where madness lurk 'd , conceal 'd in misery ;</l>
     <l n="549">Want , and th ’ ungentle world , had taught a part ,</l>
     <l n="550">And prompted cunning to that simple heart : 550</l>
     <l n="551">He now bethought him , he would roam no more ,</l>
     <l n="552">But live at home and labour as before .</l>
     <l n="553">Here clothed and fed , no sooner he began</l>

     <l n="559">We chide , we pity ;— placed among our poor ,</l>
     <l n="560">He fed again , and was a man once more . 560</l>
     <l n="561">As when a gaunt and hungry fox is found ,</l>
     <l n="562">Entrapp 'd alive in some rich hunter 's ground ;</l>

     <l n="573">And when it stopp 'd , he tried in vain to stand ;</l>
     <l n="574">Closed was his eye , and clench 'd his clammy hand ;</l>
     <l n="575">Life ebb 'd apace , and our best aid no more</l>
     <l n="576">Could his weak sense or dying heart restore :</l>

     <l n="578">That vile attorneys for the weak prepare —</l>
     <l n="579">They who , when profit or resentment call ,</l>
     <l n="580">Heed not the groaning victim they enthrall . 580</l>

     <l n="581">Then died lamented , in the strength of life ,</l>
     <l n="582">A valued Mother and a faithful Wife ;</l>

     <l n="600">Awe in each eye , alarm in every face : 600</l>
     <l n="601">So swift the ill , and of so fierce a kind ,</l>

     <l n="609">While the meek father , listening to their tones ,</l>
     <l n="610">Swell 'd the full cadence of the grief by groans . 610</l>
     <l n="611">The elder sister strove her pangs to hide ,</l>

     <l n="639">A matron she , whom every village-wife</l>

     <l n="643">Who in the house of plenty largely fed ,</l>

     <l n="717">If not , this stranger from your doors repel ,</l>
     <l n="718">And be content to be , and to be well . ”</l>
     <l n="719">She spake ; but , ah ! with words too strong and plain ;</l>
     <l n="720">Her warmth offended , and her truth was vain : 720</l>
     <l n="721">The many left her , and the friendly few ,</l>
     <l n="722">If never colder , yet they older grew ;</l>
     <l n="723">Till , unemploy 'd , she felt her spirits droop ,</l>

     <l n="725">Grew poor and peevish as her powers decay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="726">And propp 'd the tottering frame with stronger aid ;—</l>
     <l n="727">Then died !— I saw our careful swains convey ,</l>
     <l n="728">From this our changeful world , the matron 's clay ,</l>
     <l n="729">Who to this world , at least , with equal care ,</l>
     <l n="730">Brought them its changes , good and ill to share . 730</l>
     <l n="731">Now to his grave was Roger Cuff convey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="732">And strong resentment 's lingering spirit laid .</l>
     <l n="733">Shipwreck 'd in youth , he home return 'd , and found</l>
     <l n="734">His brethren three — and thrice they wish 'd him drown 'd .</l>
     <l n="735">“ Is this a landman 's love ? Be certain then ,</l>
     <l n="736">We part for ever ! ” — and they cried , “ Amen ! ”</l>
     <l n="737">His words were truth 's .— Some forty summers fled ;</l>
     <l n="738">His brethren died ; his kin supposed him dead :</l>
     <l n="739">Three nephews these , one sprightly niece , and one ,</l>
     <l n="740">Less near in blood — they call 'd him surly John ; 740</l>
     <l n="741">He work 'd in woods apart from all his kind .</l>
     <l n="742">Fierce were his looks and moody was his mind .</l>
     <l n="743">For home the Sailor now began to sigh :—</l>
     <l n="744">“ The dogs are dead , and I 'll return and die ;</l>
     <l n="745">When all I have , my gains , in years of care ,</l>
     <l n="746">The younger Cuffs with kinder souls shall share .—</l>
     <l n="747">Yet hold ! I 'm rich ;— with one consent they 'll say ,</l>
     <l n="748">‘ You 're welcome , Uncle , as the flowers in May . ’</l>
     <l n="749">No ; I 'll disguise me , be in tatters dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="750">And best befriend the lads who treat me best . ” 750</l>
     <l n="751">Now all his kindred ,— neither rich nor poor —</l>
     <l n="752">Kept the wolf want some distance from the door .</l>
     <l n="753">In piteous plight he knock 'd at George 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="754">And begg 'd for aid , as he described his state ;—</l>
     <l n="755">But stern was George :— “ Let them who had thee strong ,</l>
     <l n="756">Help thee to drag thy weaken 'd frame along ;</l>
     <l n="757">To us a stranger , while your limbs would move ,</l>
     <l n="758">From us depart and try a stranger 's love :—</l>
     <l n="759">Ha ! dost thou murmur ? ” — for , in Roger 's throat ,</l>
     <l n="760">Was “ Rascal ! ” rising with disdainful note . 760</l>
     <l n="761">To pious James he then his prayer address 'd ;—</l>
     <l n="762">“ Good lack , ” quoth James , “ thy sorrows pierce my breast ;</l>
     <l n="763">And , had I wealth , as have my brethren twain ,</l>
     <l n="764">One board should feed us and one roof contain .</l>
     <l n="765">But plead I will thy cause and I will pray ;</l>
     <l n="766">And so farewell ! Heaven help thee on thy way ! ”</l>
     <l n="767">“ Scoundrel ! ” said Roger , ( but apart ;) — and told</l>
     <l n="768">His case to Peter ;— Peter too was cold ;—</l>
     <l n="769">“ The rates are high ; we have a-many poor ;</l>
     <l n="770">But I will think , ” — he said , and shut the door . 770</l>
     <l n="771">Then the gay Niece the seeming pauper press 'd :—</l>
     <l n="772">“ Turn , Nancy , turn , and view this form distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="773">Akin to thine is this declining frame ,</l>
     <l n="774">And this poor beggar claims an Uncle 's name . ”</l>
     <l n="775">“ Avaunt ! begone ! ” the courteous maiden said ,</l>
     <l n="776">“ Thou vile impostor ! Uncle Roger 's dead :</l>
     <l n="777">I hate thee , beast ; thy look my spirit shocks !</l>
     <l n="778">Oh ! that I saw thee starving in the stocks ! ”</l>
     <l n="779">“ My gentle niece ! ” he said — and sought the wood .—</l>
     <l n="780">“ I hunger , fellow ; prithee , give me food ! ” 780</l>
     <l n="781">“ Give ! am I rich ? This hatchet take , and try</l>
     <l n="782">Thy proper strength , nor give those limbs the lie ;</l>
     <l n="783">Work , feed thyself , to thine own powers appeal ,</l>
     <l n="784">Nor whine out woes , thine own right-hand can heal :</l>
     <l n="785">And while that hand is thine and thine a leg ,</l>
     <l n="786">Scorn of the proud or of the base to beg . ”</l>
     <l n="787">“ Come , surly John , thy wealthy kinsman view , ”</l>
     <l n="788">Old Roger said :— “ thy words are brave and true ;</l>
     <l n="789">Come , live with me : we 'll vex those scoundrel-boys ,</l>
     <l n="790">And that prim shrew shall , envying , hear our joys .— 790</l>
     <l n="791">Tobacco 's glorious fume all day we 'll share ,</l>
     <l n="792">With beef and brandy kill all kinds of care ;</l>
     <l n="793">We 'll beer and biscuit on our table heap ,</l>
     <l n="794">And rail at rascals , till we fall asleep . ”</l>
     <l n="795">Such was their life ; but when the woodman died ,</l>
     <l n="796">His grieving kin for Roger 's smiles applied —</l>
     <l n="797">In vain ; he shut , with stern rebuke , the door ,</l>
     <l n="798">And dying , built a refuge for the poor :</l>
     <l n="799">With this restriction , That no Cuff should share</l>
     <l n="800">One meal , or shelter for one moment there . 800</l>

     <l n="816">Appear 'd at variance with his complaisance :</l>
     <l n="817">For , as he told their fate and varying worth ,</l>
     <l n="818">He archly look 'd ,— “ I yet may bear thee forth . ”</l>
     <l n="819">“ When first ” — ( he so began ) — “ my trade I plied ,</l>
     <l n="820">Good master Addle was the parish-guide ; 820</l>

     <l n="825">Then as he paced the hallow 'd aisles about ,</l>

     <l n="827">But in his pulpit , wearied down with prayer ,</l>
     <l n="828">He sat and seem 'd as in his study 's chair ;</l>
     <l n="829">For while the anthem swell 'd , and when it ceased ,</l>
     <l n="830">Th ’ expecting people view 'd their slumbering priest : 830</l>
     <l n="831">Who , dozing , died .— Our Parson Peele was next ;</l>
     <l n="832">‘ I will not spare you , ’ was his favourite text ;</l>
     <l n="833">Nor did he spare , but raised them many a pound ;</l>
     <l n="834">Ev'n me he mulct for my poor rood of ground ;</l>
     <l n="835">Yet cared he nought , but with a gibing speech ,</l>
     <l n="836">‘ What should I do , ’ quoth he , ‘ but what I preach ? ’</l>
     <l n="837">His piercing jokes ( and he 'd a plenteous store )</l>

     <l n="839">His scorn , his love , in playful words he spoke ;</l>
     <l n="840">His pity , praise , and promise , were a joke : 840</l>
     <l n="841">But though so young and bless 'd with spirits high ,</l>
     <l n="842">He died as grave as any judge could die :</l>
     <l n="843">The strong attack subdued his lively powers ,—</l>
     <l n="844">His was the grave , and Doctor Grandspear ours .</l>

     <l n="852">Kind to the poor , and , ah ! most kind to me :</l>
     <l n="853">‘ Ralph , ’ would he say , ‘ Ralph Dibble , thou art old ;</l>
     <l n="854">That doublet fit , ‘ twill keep thee from the cold .</l>
     <l n="855">How does my sexton ?— What ! the times are hard ;</l>
     <l n="856">Drive that stout pig , and pen him in thy yard . ’</l>
     <l n="857">But most , his rev'rence loved a mirthful jest :—</l>
     <l n="858">‘ Thy coat is thin ; why , man , thou'rt barely dress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="859">It 's worn to th ’ thread ; but I have nappy beer ;</l>
     <l n="860">Clap that within , and see how they will wear ! ’ 860</l>
     <l n="861">“ Gay days were these ; but they were quickly past :</l>
     <l n="862">When first he came , we found he cou'dn ' t last :</l>
     <l n="863">A whoreson cough ( and at the fall of leaf )</l>
     <l n="864">Upset him quite ;— but what 's the gain of grief ?</l>
     <l n="865">“ Then came the Author-Rector ; his delight</l>
     <l n="866">Was all in books ; to read them , or to write :</l>
     <l n="867">Women and men he strove alike to shun ,</l>
     <l n="868">And hurried homeward when his tasks were done ,</l>
     <l n="869">Courteous enough , but careless what he said ,</l>
     <l n="870">For points of learning he reserved his head ; 870</l>
     <l n="871">And , when addressing either poor or rich ,</l>
     <l n="872">He knew no better than his cassock which .</l>
     <l n="873">He , like an osier , was of pliant kind ,</l>
     <l n="874">Erect by nature , but to bend inclined ;</l>
     <l n="875">Not like a creeper falling to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="876">Or meanly catching on the neighbours round .—</l>
     <l n="877">Careless was he of surplice , hood , and band —</l>
     <l n="878">And kindly took them as they came to hand ;</l>
     <l n="879">Nor , like the doctor , wore a world of hat ,</l>
     <l n="880">As if he sought for dignity in that . 880</l>
     <l n="881">He talk 'd , he gave , but not with cautious rules ,</l>
     <l n="882">Nor turn 'd from gipsies , vagabonds , or fools ;</l>
     <l n="883">It was his nature , but they thought it whim ,</l>
     <l n="884">And so our beaux and beauties turn 'd from him .</l>
     <l n="885">Of questions much he wrote , profound and dark —</l>
     <l n="886">How spake the serpent , and where stopp 'd the ark ;</l>
     <l n="887">From what far land the Queen of Sheba came ;</l>
     <l n="888">Who Salem 's priest , and what his father 's name ;</l>
     <l n="889">He made the Song of Songs its mysteries yield ,</l>
     <l n="890">And Revelations , to the world , reveal 'd . 890</l>
     <l n="891">He sleeps i ’ the aisle — but not a stone records</l>
     <l n="892">His name or fame , his actions or his words :</l>
     <l n="893">And , truth , your reverence , when I look around ,</l>
     <l n="894">And mark the tombs in our sepulchral ground ,</l>
     <l n="895">( Though dare I not of one man 's hope to doubt ) ,</l>
     <l n="896">I 'd join the party who repose without ,</l>
     <l n="897">“ Next came a youth from Cambridge , and , in truth ,</l>
     <l n="898">He was a sober and a comely youth ;</l>
     <l n="899">He blush 'd in meekness as a modest man ,</l>
     <l n="900">And gain 'd attention ere his task began ; 900</l>
     <l n="901">When preaching , seldom ventured on reproof ,</l>
     <l n="902">But touch 'd his neighbours tenderly enough .</l>
     <l n="903">Him , in his youth , a clamorous sect assail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="904">Advised and censured , flatter 'd ,— and prevail 'd .—</l>
     <l n="905">Then did he much his sober hearers vex ,</l>
     <l n="906">Confound the simple , and the sad perplex ;</l>
     <l n="907">To a new style his reverence rashly took ;</l>
     <l n="908">Loud grew his voice , to threat'ning swell 'd his look ;</l>
     <l n="909">Above , below , on either side , he gazed ,</l>
     <l n="910">Amazing all , and most himself amazed : 910</l>
     <l n="911">No more he read his preachments pure and plain ,</l>
     <l n="912">But launch 'd outright , and rose and sank again :</l>
     <l n="913">At times he smiled in scorn , at times he wept , }</l>
     <l n="914">And such sad coil with words of vengeance kept , }</l>
     <l n="915">That our best sleepers started as they slept . }</l>
     <l n="916">“ ‘ Conviction comes like lightning , ’ he would cry ;</l>
     <l n="917">‘ In vain you seek it , and in vain you fly ;</l>
     <l n="918">‘ Tis like the rushing of the mighty wind ,</l>
     <l n="919">Unseen its progress , but its power you find ;</l>
     <l n="920">It strikes the child ere yet its reason wakes ; 920</l>
     <l n="921">His reason fled , the ancient sire it shakes .</l>
     <l n="922">The proud , learn 'd man , and him who loves to know</l>
     <l n="923">How and from whence these gusts of grace will blow ,</l>
     <l n="924">It shuns ,— but sinners in their way impedes ,</l>
     <l n="925">And sots and harlots visits in their deeds :</l>
     <l n="926">Of faith and penance it supplies the place ; }</l>
     <l n="927">Assures the vilest that they live by grace , }</l>
     <l n="928">And , without running , makes them win the race . ’ }</l>
     <l n="929">“ Such was the doctrine our young prophet taught ;</l>
     <l n="930">And here conviction , there confusion wrought ; 930</l>
     <l n="931">When his thin cheek assumed a deadly hue ,</l>
     <l n="932">And all the rose to one small spot withdrew :</l>
     <l n="933">They call 'd it hectic ; ‘ twas a fiery flush ,</l>
     <l n="934">More fix 'd and deeper than the maiden blush ;</l>
     <l n="935">His paler lips the pearly teeth disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="936">And lab'ring lungs the length'ning speech opposed .</l>
     <l n="937">No more his span-girth shanks and quiv'ring thighs</l>
     <l n="938">Upheld a body of the smaller size ;</l>
     <l n="939">But down he sank upon his dying bed ,</l>
     <l n="940">And gloomy crotchets fill 'd his wandering head .— 940</l>
     <l n="941">“ ‘ Spite of my faith , all-saving faith , ’ he cried ,</l>
     <l n="942">‘ I fear of worldly works the wicked pride ;</l>
     <l n="943">Poor as I am , degraded , abject , blind ,</l>
     <l n="944">The good I 've wrought still rankles in my mind ;</l>
     <l n="945">My alms-deeds all , and every deed I 've done ,</l>
     <l n="946">My moral-rags defile me , every one ;</l>
     <l n="947">It should not be — what say'st thou ? tell me , Ralph . ’</l>
     <l n="948">Quoth I , ‘ Your reverence , I believe , you 're safe ;</l>
     <l n="949">Your faith 's your prop , nor have you pass 'd such time</l>
     <l n="950">In life 's good-works as swell them to a crime . 950</l>
     <l n="951">If I of pardon for my sins were sure ,</l>
     <l n="952">About my goodness I would rest secure . ’</l>
     <l n="953">“ Such was his end ; and mine approaches fast ;</l>
     <l n="954">I 've seen my best of preachers — and my last . ” —</l>
     <l n="955">He bow 'd , and archly smiled at what he said ,</l>
     <l n="956">Civil but sly :— “ And is old Dibble dead ? ”</l>
     <l n="957">Yes ! he is gone : and WE are going all ;</l>
     <l n="958">Like flowers we wither , and like leaves we fall ;—</l>
     <l n="959">Here , with an infant , joyful sponsors come ,</l>
     <l n="960">Then bear the new-made Christian to its home ; 960</l>
     <l n="961">A few short years , and we behold him stand ,</l>
     <l n="962">To ask a blessing , with his bride in hand :</l>
     <l n="963">A few , still seeming shorter , and we hear</l>
     <l n="964">His widow weeping at her husband 's bier :—</l>
     <l n="965">Thus , as the months succeed , shall infants take</l>
     <l n="966">Their names ; thus parents shall the child forsake ;</l>
     <l n="967">Thus brides again and bridegrooms blithe shall kneel ,</l>
     <l n="968">By love or law compell 'd their vows to seal ,</l>

   <p>It has been suggested to me , that this change from restlessness to repose , in the mind of Sir Eustace , is wrought by a methodistic call ; and it is admitted to be such : a sober and rational conversion could not have happened while the disorder of the brain continued . Yet the verses which follow , in a different measure , are not intended to make any religious persuasion appear ridiculous ; they are to be supposed as the effect of memory in the disordered mind of the speaker , and , though evidently enthusiastic in respect to language , are not meant to convey any impropriety of sentiment .</p>

    <head>THE BOROUGH .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>HIS GRACE</p>
   <p>THE DUKE OF RUTLAND ,</p>
   <p>MARQUIS OF GRANBY ;</p>
   <p>RECORDER OF CAMBRIDGE AND SCARBOROUGH ; LORD-LIEUTENANT AND CUSTOS-ROTULORUM OF THE COUNTY OF LEICESTER ; K. G . &amp; LL. D .</p>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>The poem , for which I have ventured to solicit your Grace 's attention , was composed in a situation so near to Belvoir Castle , that the author had all the advantage to be derived from prospects extensive and beautiful , and from works of grandeur and sublimity : and , though nothing of the influence arising from such situation should be discernible in these verses , either from want of adequate powers in the writer , or because his subjects do not assimilate with such views , yet would it be natural for him to indulge a wish , that he might inscribe his labours to the lord of a scene which perpetually excited his admiration , and he would plead the propriety of placing the titles of the House of Rutland at the entrance of a volume written in the Vale of Belvoir .</p>
   <p>But , my Lord , a motive much more powerful than a sense of propriety , a grateful remembrance of benefits conferred by the noble family in which you preside , has been the great inducement for me to wish that I might be permitted to inscribe this work to your Grace . The honours of that time were to me unexpected , they were unmerited , and they were transitory ; but since I am thus allowed to make public my gratitude , I am in some degree restored to the honour of that period ; I have again the happiness to find myself favoured , and my exertions stimulated , by the condescension of the Duke of Rutland .</p>
   <p>It was my fortune , in a poem which yet circulates , to write of the virtues , talents , and heroic death of Lord Robert Manners , and to bear witness to the affection of a brother whose grief was poignant , and to be soothed only by remembrance of his worth whom he so deeply deplored . In a patron thus favourably predisposed , my Lord , I might look for much lenity , and could not fear the severity of critical examination : from your Grace , who , happily , have no such impediment to justice , I must not look for the same kind of indulgence . I am assured , by those whose situation gave them opportunity for knowledge , and whose abilities and attention guarded them from error , that I must not expect my failings will escape detection from want of discernment , neither am I to fear that any merit will be undistinguished through deficiency of taste . It is from this information , my Lord , and a consciousness of much which needs forgiveness , that I entreat your Grace to read my verses , with a wish , I had almost added , with a purpose , to be pleased , and to make every possible allowance for subjects not always pleasing , for manners sometimes gross , and for language too frequently incorrect .</p>
   <p>With the fullest confidence in your Grace 's ability and favour , in the accuracy of your judgment , and the lenity of your decision ; with grateful remembrance of benefits received , and due consciousness of the little I could merit ; with prayers that your Grace may long enjoy the dignities of the House of Rutland , and continue to dictate improvement for the surrounding country — I terminate an address , in which a fear of offending your Grace has made me so cautious in my expressions , that I may justly fear to offend many of my readers , who will think that something more of animation should have been excited by the objects I view , the benevolence I honour , and the gratitude I profess .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I have the honour to be ,</l>
     <l n="2">My Lord ,</l>
     <l n="3">Your Grace 's</l>
     <l n="4">Most obliged</l>
     <l n="5">and obedient humble servant ,</l>

   <p>GEORGE CRABBE .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>Whether , if I had not been encouraged by some proofs of public favour , I should have written the Poem now before the reader , is a question which I cannot positively determine ; but I will venture to assert , that I should not , in that case , have committed the work to the press ; I should not have allowed my own opinion of it to have led me into further disappointment , against the voice of judges impartial and indifferent , from whose sentence it had been fruitless to appeal . The success of a late publication , therefore , may be fairly assigned as the principal cause for the appearance of this .</p>
   <p>When the ensuing Letters were so far written , that I could form an opinion of them , and when I began to conceive that they might not be unacceptable to the public , I felt myself prompted by duty , as well as interest , to put them to the press ; I considered myself bound by gratitude for the favourable treatment I had already received , to show that I was not unmindful of it ; and , however this might be mixed with other motives , it operated with considerable force upon my mind , acting as a stimulus to exertions naturally tardy , and to expectations easily checked .</p>
   <p>It must nevertheless be acknowledged that , although such favourable opinion had been formed , I was not able , with the requisite impartiality , to determine the comparative value of an unpublished manuscript , and a work sent into the world . Books , like children , when established , have doubtless our parental affection and good wishes ; we rejoice to hear that they are doing well , and are received and respected in good company : but it is to manuscripts in the study , as to children in the nursery , that our care , our anxiety , and our tenderness are principally directed : they are fondled as our endearing companions , their faults are corrected with the lenity of partial love , and their good parts are exaggerated by the strength of parental imagination ; nor is it easy even for the more cool and reasonable among parents , thus circumstanced , to decide upon the comparative merits of their offspring , whether they be children of the bed or issue of the brain .</p>
   <p>But , however favourable my own opinion may have been , or may still be , I could not venture to commit so long a Poem to the press without some endeavour to obtain the more valuable opinion of less partial judges . At the same time , I am willing to confess that I have lost some portion of the timidity once so painful , and that I am encouraged to take upon myself the decision of various points , which heretofore I entreated my friends to decide . Those friends were then my council , whose opinion I was implicitly to follow ; they are now advisers , whose ideas I am at liberty to reject . This will not , I hope , seem like arrogance : it would be more safe , it would be more pleasant , still to have that reliance on the judgment of others ; but it cannot always be obtained ; nor are they , however friendly disposed , ever ready to lend a helping hand to him whom they consider as one who ought by this time to have cast away the timidity of inexperience , and to have acquired the courage that would enable him to decide for himself .</p>
   <p>When it is confessed that I have less assistance from my friends , and that the appearance of this work is , in a great measure , occasioned by the success of a former , some readers will , I fear , entertain the opinion that the book before them was written in haste , and published without due examination and revisal . Should this opinion be formed , there will doubtless occur many faults which may appear as originating in neglect . Now , readers are , I believe , disposed to treat with more than common severity those writers who have been led into presumption by the approbation bestowed on their diffidence , and into idleness and unconcern , by the praises given to their attention . I am therefore even anxious it should be generally known that sufficient time and application were bestowed upon this work , and by this I mean that no material alteration would be effected by delay ; it is true that this confession removes one plea for the errors of the book — want of time , but , in my opinion , there is not much consolation to be drawn by reasonable minds from this resource : if a work fails , it appears to be poor satisfaction when it is observed , that if the author had taken more care , the event had been less disgraceful .</p>
   <p>When the reader enters into the Poem , he will find the author retired from view , and an imaginary personage brought forward to describe his Borough for him . To him it seemed convenient to speak in the first person ; but the inhabitant of a village , in the centre of the kingdom , could not appear in the character of a residing burgess in a large sea-port ; and when , with this point , was considered what relations were to be given , what manners delineated , and what situations described , no method appeared to be so convenient as that of borrowing the assistance of an ideal friend . By this means the reader is in some degree kept from view of any particular place ; nor will he perhaps be so likely to determine where those persons reside , and what their connexions , who are so intimately known to this man of straw .</p>
   <p>From the title of this Poem , some persons will , I fear , expect a political satire ,— an attack upon corrupt principles in a general view , or upon the customs and manners of some particular place ; of these they will find nothing satirized , nothing related . It may be that graver readers would have preferred a more historical account of so considerable a Borough — its charter , privileges , trade , public structures , and subjects of this kind ; but I have an apology for the omission of these things , in the difficulty of describing them , and in the utter repugnancy which subsists between the studies and objects of topography and poetry . What I thought I could best describe , that I attempted :— the sea , and the country in the immediate vicinity ; the dwellings , and the inhabitants ; some incidents and characters , with an exhibition of morals and manners , offensive perhaps to those of extremely delicate feelings , but sometimes , I hope , neither unamiable nor unaffecting . An Election indeed forms a part of one Letter , but the evil there described is one not greatly nor generally deplored , and there are probably many places of this kind where it is not felt .</p>
   <p>From the variety of relations , characters , and descriptions which a BOROUGH affords , several were rejected which a reader might reasonably expect to have met with : in this case he is entreated to believe that these , if they occurred to the author , were considered by him as beyond his ability , as subjects which he could not treat in a manner satisfactory to himself . Possibly the admission of some will be thought to require more apology than the rejection of others . In such variety , it is to be apprehended , that almost every reader will find something not according with his ideas of propriety , or something repulsive to the tone of his feelings ; nor could this be avoided but by the sacrifice of every event , opinion , and even expression , which could be thought liable to produce such effect ; and this casting away so largely of our cargo , through fears of danger , though it might help us to clear it , would render our vessel of little worth when she came into port . I may likewise entertain a hope , that this very variety , which gives scope to objection and censure , will also afford a better chance for approval and satisfaction .</p>
   <p>Of these objectionable parts many must be to me unknown ; of others some opinion may be formed , and for their admission some plea may be stated .</p>
   <p>In the first Letter is nothing which particularly calls for remark , except possibly the last line — giving a promise to the reader that he should both smile and sigh in the perusal of the following Letters . This may appear vain , and more than an author ought to promise ; but let it be considered that the character assumed is that of a friend , who gives an account of objects , persons , and events to his correspondent , and who was therefore at liberty , without any imputation of this kind , to suppose in what manner he would be affected by such descriptions .</p>
   <p>Nothing , I trust , in the second Letter , which relates to the imitation of what are called weather-stains on buildings , will seem to any invidious or offensive . I wished to make a comparison between those minute and curious bodies which cover the surface of some edifices , and those kinds of stain which are formed of boles and ochres , and laid on with a brush . Now , as the work of time cannot be anticipated in such cases , it may be very judicious to have recourse to such expedients as will give to a recent structure the venerable appearance of antiquity ; and in this case , though I might still observe the vast difference between the living varieties of nature , and the distant imitation of the artist , yet I would not forbear to make use of his dexterity , because he could not clothe my freestone with mucor , lichen , and byssus .</p>
   <p>The wants and mortifications of a poor Clergyman are the subjects of one portion of the third Letter ; and , he being represented as a stranger in the Borough , it may be necessary to make some apology for his appearance in the Poem . Previous to a late meeting of a literary society , whose benevolent purpose is well known to the public , I was induced by a friend to compose a few verses , in which , with the general commendation of the design , should be introduced a hint that the bounty might be farther extended ; these verses a gentleman did me the honour to recite at the meeting , and they were printed as an extract from the Poem , to which in fact they may be called an appendage .</p>
   <p>I am now arrived at that part of my work , which I may expect will bring upon me some animadversion . Religion is a subject deeply interesting to the minds of many ; and , when these minds are weak , they are often led by a warmth of feeling into the violence of causeless resentment . I am therefore anxious that my purpose should be understood ; and I wish to point out what things they are which an author may hold up to ridicule and be blameless . In referring to the two principal divisions of enthusiastical teachers , I have denominated them , as I conceive they are generally called , Calvinistic and Arminian Methodists . The Arminians , though divided and perhaps subdivided , are still , when particular accuracy is not intended , considered as one body , having had , for many years , one head , who is yet held in high respect by the varying members of the present day . But the Calvinistic societies are to be looked upon rather as separate and independent congregations ; and it is to one of these ( unconnected , as is supposed , with any other ) I more particularly allude . But while I am making use of this division , I must entreat that I may not be considered as one who takes upon him to censure the religious opinions of any society or individual : the reader will find that the spirit of the enthusiast , and not his opinions , his manners , and not his creed , have engaged my attention . I have nothing to observe of the Calvinist and Arminian , considered as such ; but my remarks are pointed at the enthusiast and the bigot , at their folly and their craft .</p>
   <p>To those readers who have seen the journals of the first Methodists , or the extracts quoted from them by their opposers<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>in the early times of this spiritual influenza , are sufficiently known all their leading notions and peculiarities ; so that I have no need to enter into such unpleasant inquiries in this place . I have only to observe that their tenets remain the same , and have still the former effect on the minds of the converted . There is yet that imagined contention with the powers of darkness , that is at once so lamentable and so ludicrous ; there is the same offensive familiarity with the Deity , with a full trust and confidence both in the immediate efficacy of their miserably delivered supplications , and in the reality of numberless small miracles wrought at their request and for their convenience ; there still exists that delusion , by which some of the most common diseases of the body are regarded as proofs of the malignity of Satan contending for dominion over the soul ; and there still remains the same wretched jargon , composed of scriptural language , debased by vulgar expressions , which has a kind of mystic influence on the minds of the ignorant . It will be recollected that it is the abuse of those scriptural terms which I conceive to be improper : they are doubtless most significant and efficacious when used with propriety ; but it is painful to the mind of a soberly devout person , when he hears every rise and fall of the animal spirits , every whim and notion of enthusiastic ignorance , expressed in the venerable language of the Apostles and Evangelists .</p>
   <p>The success of these people is great , but not surprising : as the powers they claim are given , and come not of education , many may , and therefore do , fancy they are endowed with them ; so that they who do not venture to become preachers , yet exert the minor gifts , and gain reputation for the faculty of prayer , as soon as they can address the Creator in daring flights of unpremeditated absurdity . The less indigent gain the praise of hospitality , and the more harmonious become distinguished in their choirs ; curiosity is kept alive by succession of ministers , and self-love is flattered by the consideration that they are the persons at whom the world wonders ; add to this , that , in many of them , pride is gratified by their consequence as new members of a sect whom their conversion pleases , and by the liberty , which as seceders they take , of speaking contemptuously of the Church and ministers , whom they have relinquished .</p>
   <p>Of those denominated Calvinistic Methodists I had principally one sect in view , or , to adopt the term of its founder , a church . This church consists of several congregations in town and country , unknown perhaps in many parts of the kingdom , but , where known , the cause of much curiosity and some amusement . To such of my readers as may judge an enthusiastic teacher and his peculiarities to be unworthy any serious attention , I would observe that there is something unusually daring in the boast of this man , who claims the authority of a messenger sent from God , and declares without hesitation that his call was immediate ; that he is assisted by the sensible influence of the Spirit , and that miracles are perpetually wrought in his favour and for his convenience .</p>
   <p>As it was and continues to be my desire to give proof that I had advanced nothing respecting this extraordinary person , his operations or assertions , which might not be readily justified by quotations from his own writings , I had collected several of these and disposed them under certain heads . But I found that by this means a very disproportioned share of attention must be given to the subject , and after some consideration , I have determined to relinquish the design ; and , should any have curiosity to search whether my representation of the temper and disposition , the spirit and manners , the knowledge and capacity , of a very popular teacher be correct , he is referred to about fourscore pamphlets , whose titles will be found on the covers of the late editions of the Bank of Faith , itself a wonderful performance , which ( according to the turn of mind in the reader ) will either highly excite , or totally extinguish , curiosity . In these works will be abundantly seen , abuse and contempt of the Church of England and its ministers ; vengeance and virulent denunciation against all offenders ; scorn for morality and heathen virtue , with that kind of learning which the author possesses , and his peculiar style of composition . A few of the titles placed below will give some information to the reader respecting the merit and design of those performances<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>.</p>
   <p>As many of the preacher 's subjects are controverted and nice questions in divinity , he has sometimes allowed himself relaxation from the severity of study , and favoured his admirers with the effects of an humbler kind of inspiration , viz . that of the Muse . It must be confessed that these flights of fancy are very humble , and have nothing of that daring and mysterious nature which the prose of the author leads us to expect . The Dimensions of eternal LOVE is a title of one of his more learned productions , with which might have been expected ( as a fit companion ) The Bounds of infinite Grace ; but no such work appears , and possibly the author considered one attempt of this kind was sufficient to prove the extent and direction of his abilities .</p>
   <p>Of the whole of this mass of inquiry and decision , of denunciation and instruction ( could we suppose it read by intelligent persons ) , different opinions would probably be formed ; the more indignant and severe would condemn the whole as the produce of craft and hypocrisy , while the more lenient would allow that such things might originate in the wandering imagination of a dreaming enthusiast .</p>
   <p>None of my readers will , I trust , do me so much injustice as to suppose I have here any other motive than a vindication of what I have advanced in the verses which describe this kind of character , or that I had there any other purpose than to express ( what I conceive to be ) justifiable indignation against the assurance , the malignity , and ( what is of more importance ) the pernicious influence of such sentiments on the minds of the simple and ignorant , who , if they give credit to his relations , must be no more than tools and instruments under the control and management of one called to be their Apostle .</p>
   <p>Nothing would be more easy for me , as I have observed , than to bring forward quotations such as would justify all I have advanced ; but , even had I room , I cannot tell whether there be not something degrading in such kind of attack : the reader might smile at those miraculous accounts , but he would consider them and the language of the author as beneath his further attention : I therefore once more refer him to those pamphlets , which will afford matter for pity and for contempt by which some would be amused and others astonished — not without sorrow , when they reflect that thousands look up to the writer as a man literally inspired , to whose wants they administer with their substance , and to whose guidance they prostrate their spirit and understanding .</p>
   <p>Having been so long detained by this Letter , I must not permit my desire of elucidating what may seem obscure , or of defending what is liable to misconstruction , any further to prevail over a wish for brevity , and the fear of giving an air of importance to subjects which have perhaps little in themselves .</p>
   <p>The circumstance recorded in the fifth Letter is a fact ; although it may appear to many almost incredible , that , in this country , and but few years since , a close and successful man should be a stranger to the method of increasing money by the loan of it . The Minister of the place where the honest Fisherman resided has related to me the apprehension and suspicion he witnessed . With trembling hand and dubious look , the careful man received and surveyed the bond given to him ; and , after a sigh or two of lingering mistrust , he placed it in the coffer whence he had just before taken his cash ; for which , and for whose increase , he now indulged a belief that it was indeed both promise and security .</p>
   <p>If the Letter which treats of Inns should be found to contain nothing interesting or uncommon ; if it describe things which we behold every day , and some which we do not wish to behold at any time : let it be considered that this Letter is one of the shortest , and that from a Poem whose subject was a Borough , populous and wealthy , these places of public accommodation could not , without some impropriety , be excluded .</p>
   <p>I entertain the strongest , because the most reasonable , hope that no liberal practitioner in the Law will be offended by the notice taken of dishonourable and crafty attorneys . The increased difficulty of entering into the profession will in time render it much more free than it now is from those who disgrace it ; at present such persons remain , and it would not be difficult to give instances of neglect , ignorance , cruelty , oppression , and chicanery ; nor are they by any means confined to one part of the country : quacks and impostors are indeed in every profession , as well with a licence as without one . The character and actions of Swallow might doubtless be contrasted by the delineation of an able and upright Solicitor ; but this Letter is of sufficient length , and such persons , without question , are already known to my readers .</p>
   <p>When I observe , under the article Physic , that the young and less experienced physician will write rather with a view of making himself known , than to investigate and publish some useful fact , I would not be thought to extend this remark to all the publications of such men . I could point out a work , containing experiments the most judicious , and conclusions the most interesting , made by a gentleman , then young , which would have given just celebrity to a man after long practice . The observation is nevertheless generally true : many opinions have been adopted and many books written , not that the theory might be well defended , but that a young physician might be better known .</p>
   <p>If I have in one Letter praised the good-humour of a man confessedly too inattentive to business , and , in another , if I have written somewhat sarcastically of “ the brick-floored parlour which the butcher lets : ” be credit given to me , that in the one case I had no intention to apologize for idleness , nor any design in the other to treat with contempt the resources of the poor . The good-humour is considered as the consolation of disappointment , and the room is so mentioned because the lodger is vain . Most of my readers will perceive this ; but I shall be sorry if by any I am supposed to make pleas for the vices of men , or treat their wants and infirmities with derision or with disdain .</p>
   <p>It is probable , that really polite people , with cultivated minds and harmonious tempers , may judge my description of a Card-club conversation to be highly exaggerated , if not totally fictitious ; and I acknowledge that the club must admit a particular kind of members to afford such specimens of acrimony and objurgation . Yet , that such language is spoken , and such manners exhibited , is most certain , chiefly among those who , being successful in life , without previous education , not very nice in their feelings , or very attentive to improprieties , sit down to game with no other view than that of adding the gain of the evening to the profits of the day ; whom therefore disappointment itself makes angry , and , when caused by another ; resentful and vindictive .</p>
   <p>The Letter on Itinerant Players will to some appear too harshly written , their profligacy exaggerated , and their distresses magnified ; but , though the respectability of a part of these people may give us a more favourable view of the whole body , though some actors be sober , and some managers prudent : still there is vice and misery left , more than sufficient to justify my description . But , if I could find only one woman who ( passing forty years on many stages , and sustaining many principal characters ) laments in her unrespected old age , that there was no workhouse to which she could legally sue for admission ; if I could produce only one female , seduced upon the boards , and starved in her lodging , compelled by her poverty to sing , and by her sufferings to weep , without any prospect but misery , or any consolation but death ; if I could exhibit only one youth who sought refuge from parental authority in the licentious freedom of a wandering company : yet , with three such examples , I should feel myself justified in the account I have given .— But such characters and sufferings are common , and there are few of these societies which could not show members of this description . To some , indeed , the life has its satisfactions : they never expected to be free from labour , and their present kind , they think , is light ; they have no delicate ideas of shame , and therefore duns and hisses give them no other pain than what arises from the fear of not being trusted , joined with the apprehension that they may have nothing to subsist upon except their credit .</p>
   <p>For the Alms-House itself , its Governors and Inhabitants , I have not much to offer , in favour of the subject or of the characters . One of these , Sir Denys Brand , may be considered as too highly placed for an author ( who seldom ventures above middle-life ) to delineate ; and indeed I had some idea of reserving him for another occasion , where he might have appeared with those in his own rank ; but then it is most uncertain whether he would ever appear , and he has been so many years prepared for the public whenever opportunity might offer , that I have at length given him place , and though with his inferiors , yet as a ruler over them . Of these , one ( Benbow ) may be thought too low and despicable to be admitted here ; but he is a Borough-character , and , however disgusting in some respects a picture may be , it will please some , and be tolerated by many , if it can boast that one merit of being a faithful likeness .</p>
   <p>Blaney and Clelia , a male and female inhabitant of this mansion , are drawn at some length ; and I may be thought to have given them attention which they do not merit . I plead not for the originality , but for the truth , of the character ; and , though it may not be very pleasing , it may be useful to delineate ( for certain minds ) these mixtures of levity and vice ; people who are thus incurably vain and determinately worldly ; thus devoted to enjoyment and insensible of shame , and so miserably fond of their pleasures , that they court even the remembrance with eager solicitation , by conjuring up the ghosts of departed indulgences with all the aid that memory can afford them . These characters demand some attention , because they hold out a warning to that numerous class of young people who are too lively to be discreet ; to whom the purpose of life is amusement , and who are always in danger of falling into vicious habits , because they have too much activity to be quiet , and too little strength to be steady .</p>
   <p>The characters of the Hospital-Directors were written many years since , and , so far as I was capable of judging , are drawn with fidelity . I mention this circumstance , that , if any reader should find a difference in the versification or expression , he will be thus enabled to account for it .</p>
   <p>The Poor are here almost of necessity introduced , for they must be considered , in every place , as a large and interesting portion of its inhabitants . I am aware of the great difficulty of acquiring just notions on the maintenance and management of this class of our fellow-subjects , and I forbear to express any opinion of the various modes which have been discussed or adopted : of one method only I venture to give my sentiments , that of collecting the poor of a hundred into one building . This admission of a vast number of persons , of all ages and both sexes , of very different inclinations , habits , and capacities , into a society , must , at a first view , I conceive , be looked upon as a cause of both vice and misery ; nor does anything which I have heard or read invalidate the opinion ; happily , it is not a prevailing one , as these houses are , I believe , still confined to that part of the kingdom where they originated .</p>
   <p>To this subject follow several Letters describing the follies , and crimes of persons in lower life , with one relation of a happier and more consolatory kind . It has been a subject of greater vexation to me than such trifle ought to be , that I could not , without destroying all appearance of arrangement , separate these melancholy narratives , and place the fallen Clerk in Office at a greater distance from the Clerk of the Parish , especially as they resembled each other in several particulars ; both being tempted , seduced , and wretched . Yet are there , I conceive , considerable marks of distinction : their guilt is of different kind ; nor would either have committed the offence of the other . The Clerk of the Parish could break the commandment , but he could not have been induced to have disowned an article of that creed for which he had so bravely contended , and on which he fully relied ; and the upright mind of the Clerk in Office would have secured him from being guilty of wrong and robbery , though his weak and vacillating intellect could not preserve him from infidelity and profaneness . Their melancholy is nearly alike , but not its consequences . Jachin retained his belief , and though he hated life , he could never be induced to quit it voluntarily ; but Abel was driven to terminate his misery in a way which the unfixedness of his religious opinions rather accelerated than retarded . I am therefore not without hope that the more observant of my readers will perceive many marks of discrimination in these characters .</p>
   <p>The Life of Ellen Orford , though sufficiently burthened with error and misfortune , has in it little besides , which resembles those of the above unhappy men , and is still more unlike that of Grimes , in a subsequent Letter . There is in this character cheerfulness and resignation , a more uniform piety , and an immovable trust in the aid of religion : this , with the light texture of the introductory part , will , I hope , take off from that idea of sameness which the repetition of crimes and distresses is likely to create . The character of Grimes , his obduracy and apparent want of feeling , his gloomy kind of misanthropy , the progress of his madness , and the horrors of his imagination , I must leave to the judgment and observation of my readers . The mind here exhibited is one untouched by pity , unstung by remorse , and uncorrected by shame : yet is this hardihood of temper and spirit broken by want , disease , solitude , and disappointment ; and he becomes the victim of a distempered and horror-stricken fancy . It is evident , therefore , that no feeble vision , no half-visible ghost , not the momentary glance of an unbodied being , nor the half-audible voice of an invisible one , would be created by the continual workings of distress on a mind so depraved and flinty . The ruffian of Mr Scott<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span>has a mind of this nature : he has no shame or remorse : but the corrosion of hopeless want , the wasting of unabating disease , and the gloom of unvaried solitude , will have their effect on every nature ; and , the harder that nature is , and the longer time required to work upon it , so much the more strong and indelible is the impression . This is all the reason I am able to give , why a man of feeling so dull should yet become insane , should be of so horrible a nature .</p>
   <p>That a Letter on Prisons should follow those narratives is unfortunate , but not to be easily avoided . I confess it is not pleasant to be detained so long by subjects so repulsive to the feelings of many as the sufferings of mankind ; but , though I assuredly would have altered this arrangement , had I been able to have done it by substituting a better , yet am I not of opinion that my verses , or indeed the verses of any other person , can so represent the evils and distresses of life as to make any material impression on the mind , and much less any of injurious nature . Alas ! sufferings real , evident , continually before us , have not effects very serious or lasting , even in the minds of the more reflecting and compassionate ; nor indeed does it seem right that the pain caused by sympathy should serve for more than a stimulus to benevolence . If , then , the strength and solidity of truth placed before our eyes have effect so feeble and transitory , I need not be very apprehensive that my representations of Poor-houses and Prisons , of wants and sufferings , however faithfully taken , will excite any feelings which can be seriously lamented . It has always been held as a salutary exercise of the mind , to contemplate the evils and miseries of our nature . I am not , therefore , without hope , that even this gloomy subject of Imprisonment , and more especially the Dream of the condemned Highwayman , will excite in some minds that mingled pity and abhorrence , which , while it is not unpleasant to the feelings , is useful in its operation : it ties and binds us to all mankind by sensations common to us all , and in some degree connects us , without degradation , even to the most miserable and guilty of our fellow-men .</p>
   <p>Our concluding subject is Education ; and some attempt is made to describe its various seminaries , from that of the Poor Widow , who pronounces the alphabet for infants , to seats whence the light of learning is shed abroad on the world . If , in this Letter , I describe the lives of literary men as embittered by much evil ; if they be often disappointed , and sometimes unfitted for the world they improve : let it be considered that they are described as men who possess that great pleasure , the exercise of their own talents , and the delight which flows from their own exertions ; they have joy in their pursuits , and glory in their acquirements of knowledge . Their victory over difficulties affords the most rational cause of triumph , and the attainment of new ideas leads to incalculable riches , such as gratify the glorious avarice of aspiring and comprehensive minds . Here , then , I place the reward of learning .— Our Universities produce men of the first scholastic attainments , who are heirs to large possessions , or descendants from noble families . Now , to those so favoured , talents and acquirements are , unquestionably , means of arriving at the most elevated and important situations ; but these must be the lot of a few . In general , the diligence , acuteness , and perseverance of a youth at the University , have no other reward than some College honours and emoluments , which they desire to exchange , many of them , for very moderate incomes in the obscurity of some distant village : so that , in stating the reward of an ardent and powerful mind to consist principally ( I might have said entirely ) in its own views , efforts , and excursions , I place it upon a sure foundation , though not one so elevated as the more ambitious aspire to . It is surely some encouragement to a studious man to reflect , that if he be disappointed , he cannot be without gratification ; and that , if he gets but a very humble portion of what the world can give , he has a continual fruition of unwearying enjoyment , of which it has not power to deprive him .</p>
   <p>Long as I have detained the reader , I take leave to add a few words on the subject of imitation , or , more plainly speaking , borrowing . In the course of a long Poem , and more especially of two long ones , it is very difficult to avoid a recurrence of the same thoughts , and of similar expressions ; and , however careful I have been myself in detecting and removing these kinds of repetitions , my readers , I question not , would , if disposed to seek them , find many remaining . For these I can only plead that common excuse — they are the offences of a bad memory , and not of voluntary inattention ; to which I must add the difficulty ( I have already mentioned ) of avoiding the error . This kind of plagiarism will therefore , I conceive , be treated with lenity ; and of the more criminal kind , borrowing from others , I plead , with much confidence , “ not guilty . ” But while I claim exemption from guilt , I do not affirm that much of sentiment and much of expression may not be detected in the vast collection of English poetry : it is sufficient for an author , that he uses not the words or ideas of another without acknowledgment ; and this , and no more than this , I mean , by disclaiming debts of the kind . Yet resemblances are sometimes so very striking , that it requires faith in a reader to admit they were undesigned . A line in the second Letter ,</p>
   <p>“ And monuments themselves memorials need , ”</p>
   <p>was written long before the author , in an accidental recourse to Juvenal , read —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Quandoquidem data sunt ipsis quoque fata sepulchris . ”</l>
     <l n="2">Sat . x. l. 146 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and for this I believe the reader will readily give me credit . But there is another apparent imitation in the life of Blaney ( Letter xiv ) , a simile of so particular a kind , that its occurrence to two writers at the same time must appear as an extraordinary event . For this reason I once determined to exclude it from the relation , but , as it was truly unborrowed , and suited the place in which it stood , this seemed , on after-consideration , to be an act of cowardice , and the lines are therefore printed as they were written about two months before the very same thought ( prosaically drest ) appeared in a periodical work of the last summer . It is highly probable , in these cases , that both may derive the idea from a forgotten but common source ; and in this way I must entreat the reader to do me justice , by accounting for other such resemblances , should any be detected .</p>
   <p>I know not whether to some readers the placing two or three Latin quotations to a Letter may not appear pedantic and ostentatious , while both they and the English ones may be thought unnecessary . For the necessity I have not much to advance ; but if they be allowable ( and certainly the best writers have adopted them ) , then , where two or three different subjects occur , so many of these mottoes seem to be required : nor will a charge of pedantry remain , when it is considered that these things are generally taken from some books familiar to the school-boy , and the selecting them is facilitated by the use of a book of common-place . Yet , with this help , the task of motto-hunting has been so unpleasant to me , that I have in various instances given up the quotation I was in pursuit of , and substituted such English verse or prose as I could find or invent for my purpose .</p>

    <head>GENERAL DESCRIPTION .</head>
     <l n="1">“ Describe the Borough . ” — Though our idle tribe</l>
     <l n="2">May love description , can we so describe ,</l>
     <l n="3">That you shall fairly streets and buildings trace ,</l>
     <l n="4">And all that gives distinction to a place ?</l>
     <l n="5">This cannot be ; yet , moved by your request ,</l>
     <l n="6">A part I paint — let fancy form the rest .</l>
     <l n="7">Cities and towns , the various haunts of men ,</l>
     <l n="8">Require the pencil ; they defy the pen .</l>
     <l n="9">Could he , who sang so well the Grecian fleet ,</l>
     <l n="10">So well have sung of alley , lane , or street ? 10</l>
     <l n="11">Can measured lines these various buildings show ,</l>
     <l n="12">The Town-Hall Turning , or the Prospect Row ?</l>
     <l n="13">Can I the seats of wealth and want explore ,</l>
     <l n="14">And lengthen out my lays from door to door ?</l>
     <l n="15">Then , let thy fancy aid me .— I repair</l>
     <l n="16">From this tall mansion of our last-year 's mayor ,</l>
     <l n="17">Till we the outskirts of the Borough reach ,</l>
     <l n="18">And these half-buried buildings next the beach ;</l>
     <l n="19">Where hang at open doors the net and cork ,</l>
     <l n="20">While squalid sea-dames mend the meshy work ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Till comes the hour , when , fishing through the tide ,</l>
     <l n="22">The weary husband throws his freight aside —</l>
     <l n="23">A living mass , which now demands the wife ,</l>
     <l n="24">Th ’ alternate labours of their humble life .</l>
     <l n="25">Can scenes like these withdraw thee from thy wood ,</l>
     <l n="26">Thy upland forest or thy valley 's flood ?</l>
     <l n="27">Seek , then , thy garden 's shrubby bound , and look ,</l>
     <l n="28">As it steals by , upon the bordering brook :</l>
     <l n="29">That winding streamlet , limpid , lingering , slow ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where the reeds whisper when the zephyrs blow ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Where in the midst , upon her throne of green ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sits the large lily<span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>as the water 's queen ;</l>
     <l n="33">And makes the current , forced awhile to stay ,</l>
     <l n="34">Murmur and bubble as it shoots away ;</l>
     <l n="35">Draw then the strongest contrast to that stream ,</l>
     <l n="36">And our broad river will before thee seem .</l>
     <l n="37">With ceaseless motion comes and goes the tide ,</l>
     <l n="38">Flowing , it fills the channel vast and wide ;</l>
     <l n="39">Then back to sea , with strong majestic sweep</l>
     <l n="40">It rolls , in ebb yet terrible and deep ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Here sampire-banks<span type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>and salt-wort<span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>bound the flood ;</l>
     <l n="42">There stakes and sea-weeds , withering on the mud ;</l>
     <l n="43">And , higher up , a ridge of all things base ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which some strong tide has roll 'd upon the place .</l>
     <l n="45">Thy gentle river boasts its pigmy boat ,</l>
     <l n="46">Urged on by pains , half grounded , half afloat ;</l>
     <l n="47">While at her stern an angler takes his stand ,</l>
     <l n="48">And marks the fish he purposes to land ;</l>
     <l n="49">From that clear space , where , in the cheerful ray</l>
     <l n="50">Of the warm sun , the scaly people play . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Far other craft our prouder river shows ,</l>
     <l n="52">Hoys , pinks and sloops ; brigs , brigantines and snows :</l>
     <l n="53">Nor angler we on our wide stream descry ,</l>
     <l n="54">But one poor dredger where his oysters lie :</l>
     <l n="55">He , cold and wet , and driving with the tide ,</l>
     <l n="56">Beats his weak arms against his tarry side ,</l>
     <l n="57">Then drains the remnant of diluted gin ,</l>
     <l n="58">To aid the warmth that languishes within ;</l>
     <l n="59">Renewing oft his poor attempts to beat</l>
     <l n="60">His tingling fingers into gathering heat . 60</l>
     <l n="61">He shall again be seen when evening comes ,</l>
     <l n="62">And social parties crowd their favourite rooms ;</l>
     <l n="63">Where on the table pipes and papers lie ,</l>
     <l n="64">The steaming bowl or foaming tankard by .</l>
     <l n="65">‘ Tis then , with all these comforts spread around ,</l>
     <l n="66">They hear the painful dredger 's welcome sound ;</l>
     <l n="67">And few themselves the savoury boon deny ,</l>
     <l n="68">The food that feeds , the living luxury .</l>
     <l n="69">Yon is our quay ! those smaller hoys from town .</l>
     <l n="70">Its various wares , for country-use , bring down ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">Those laden waggons , in return , impart</l>
     <l n="72">The country-produce to the city mart ;</l>
     <l n="73">Hark to the clamour in that miry road ,</l>
     <l n="74">Bounded and narrow 'd by yon vessels ’ load ;</l>
     <l n="75">The lumbering wealth she empties round the place ,</l>
     <l n="76">Package , and parcel , hogshead , chest , and case ;</l>
     <l n="77">While the loud seaman and the angry hind ,</l>
     <l n="78">Mingling in business , bellow to the wind .</l>
     <l n="79">Near these a crew amphibious , in the docks ,</l>
     <l n="80">Rear , for the sea , those castles on the stocks : 80</l>
     <l n="81">See the long keel , which soon the waves must hide ;</l>
     <l n="82">See the strong ribs which form the roomy side ;</l>
     <l n="83">Bolts yielding slowly to the sturdiest stroke ,</l>
     <l n="84">And planks<span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>which curve and crackle in the smoke .</l>
     <l n="85">Around the whole rise cloudy wreaths , and far</l>
     <l n="86">Bear the warm pungence of o'erhYpppHeNboiling tar .</l>
     <l n="87">Dabbling on shore half-naked sea-boys crowd ,</l>
     <l n="88">Swim round a ship , or swing upon the shroud ;</l>
     <l n="89">Or , in a boat purloin 'd , with paddles play ,</l>
     <l n="90">And grow familiar with the watery way . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Young though they be , they feel whose sons they are ;</l>
     <l n="92">They know what British seamen do and dare ;</l>
     <l n="93">Proud of that fame , they raise and they enjoy</l>
     <l n="94">The rustic wonder of the village-boy .</l>
     <l n="95">Before you bid these busy scenes adieu ,</l>
     <l n="96">Behold the wealth that lies in public view ,</l>
     <l n="97">Those far-extended heaps of coal and coke ,</l>
     <l n="98">Where fresh-fill 'd lime-kilns breathe their stifling smoke .</l>
     <l n="99">This shall pass off , and you behold , instead ,</l>
     <l n="100">The night-fire gleaming on its chalky bed ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">When from the light-house brighter beams will rise ,</l>
     <l n="102">To show the shipman where the shallow lies .</l>
     <l n="103">Thy walks are ever pleasant ; every scene</l>
     <l n="104">Is rich in beauty , lively , or serene :</l>
     <l n="105">Rich — is that varied view with woods around ,</l>
     <l n="106">Seen from the seat , within the shrubb'ry bound ;</l>
     <l n="107">Where shines the distant lake , and where appear</l>
     <l n="108">From ruins bolting , unmolested deer ;</l>
     <l n="109">Lively — the village-green , the inn , the place</l>
     <l n="110">Where the good widow schools her infant race ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Shops , whence are heard the hammer and the saw ,</l>
     <l n="112">And village-pleasures unreproved by law .</l>
     <l n="113">Then , how serene — when in your favourite room ,</l>
     <l n="114">Gales from your jasmines soothe the evening gloom ;</l>
     <l n="115">When from your upland paddock you look down ,</l>
     <l n="116">And just perceive the smoke which hides the town ;</l>
     <l n="117">When weary peasants at the close of day</l>
     <l n="118">Walk to their cots , and part upon the way ;</l>
     <l n="119">When cattle slowly cross the shallow brook ,</l>
     <l n="120">And shepherds pen their folds , and rest upon their crook . 120</l>
     <l n="121">We prune our hedges , prime our slender trees ,</l>
     <l n="122">And nothing looks untutor 'd and at ease ;</l>
     <l n="123">On the wide heath , or in the flow'ry vale ,</l>
     <l n="124">We scent the vapours of the sea-born gale ;</l>
     <l n="125">Broad-beaten paths lead on from stile to stile ,</l>
     <l n="126">And sewers from streets the road-side banks defile ;</l>
     <l n="127">Our guarded fields a sense of danger show ,</l>
     <l n="128">Where garden-crops with corn and clover grow ;</l>
     <l n="129">Fences are form 'd of wreck and placed around</l>
     <l n="130">( With tenters tipp 'd ) , a strong repulsive bound ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">Wide and deep ditches by the gardens run ,</l>
     <l n="132">And there in ambush lie the trap and gun ;</l>
     <l n="133">Or yon broad board , which guards each tempting prize ,</l>
     <l n="134">“ Like a tall bully , lifts its head and lies . ”</l>
     <l n="135">There stands a cottage with an open door ,</l>
     <l n="136">Its garden undefended blooms before ;</l>
     <l n="137">Her wheel is still , and overturn 'd her stool ,</l>
     <l n="138">While the lone widow seeks the neighb'ring pool .</l>
     <l n="139">This gives us hope all views of town to shun —</l>
     <l n="140">No ! here are tokens of the sailor-son : 140</l>
     <l n="141">That old blue jacket , and that shirt of check ,</l>
     <l n="142">And silken kerchief for the seaman 's neck ;</l>
     <l n="143">Sea-spoils and shells from many a distant shore ,</l>
     <l n="144">And furry robe from frozen Labrador .</l>
     <l n="145">Our busy streets and sylvan-walks between ,</l>
     <l n="146">Fen , marshes , bog and heath all intervene ;</l>
     <l n="147">Here pits of crag , with spongy , plashy base ,</l>
     <l n="148">To some enrich th ’ uncultivated space :</l>
     <l n="149">For there are blossoms rare , and curious rush ,</l>
     <l n="150">The gale 's rich balm , and sun-dew 's crimson blush , 150</l>
     <l n="151">Whose velvet leaf , with radiant beauty dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="152">Forms a gay pillow for the plover 's breast .</l>
     <l n="153">Not distant far , a house , commodious made ,</l>
     <l n="154">Lonely yet public stands , for Sunday-trade ;</l>
     <l n="155">Thither , for this day free , gay parties go ,</l>
     <l n="156">Their tea-house walk , their tippling rendezvous ;</l>
     <l n="157">There humble couples sit in corner-bowers ,</l>
     <l n="158">Or gaily ramble for th ’ allotted hours ;</l>
     <l n="159">Sailors and lasses from the town attend ,</l>
     <l n="160">The servant-lover , the apprentice-friend ; 160</l>
     <l n="161">With all the idle social tribes who seek</l>
     <l n="162">And find their humble pleasures once a week .</l>
     <l n="163">Turn to the watery world !— but who to thee</l>
     <l n="164">( A wonder yet unview 'd ) shall paint — the sea ?</l>
     <l n="165">Various and vast , sublime in all its forms ,</l>
     <l n="166">When lull 'd by zephyrs , or when roused by storms ;</l>
     <l n="167">Its colours changing , when from clouds and sun</l>
     <l n="168">Shades after shades upon the surface run ;</l>
     <l n="169">Embrown 'd and horrid now , and now serene ,</l>
     <l n="170">In limpid blue , and evanescent green ; 170</l>
     <l n="171">And oft the foggy banks on ocean lie ,</l>
     <l n="172">Lift the fair sail , and cheat th ’ experienced eye<span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>.</l>
     <l n="173">Be it the summer-noon : a sandy space</l>
     <l n="174">The ebbing tide has left upon its place ;</l>
     <l n="175">Then , just the hot and stony beach above ,</l>
     <l n="176">Light twinkling streams in bright confusion move</l>
     <l n="177">( For heated thus , the warmer air ascends ,</l>
     <l n="178">And with the cooler in its fall contends ) ;</l>
     <l n="179">Then the broad bosom of the ocean keeps</l>
     <l n="180">An equal motion , swelling as it sleeps , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Then slowly sinking ; curling to the strand ,</l>
     <l n="182">Faint , lazy waves o'ercreep the ridgy sand ,</l>
     <l n="183">Or tap the tarry boat with gentle blow ,</l>
     <l n="184">And back return in silence , smooth and slow .</l>
     <l n="185">Ships in the calm seem anchored ; for they glide</l>
     <l n="186">On the still sea , urged solely by the tide ;</l>
     <l n="187">Art thou not present , this calm scene before , }</l>
     <l n="188">Where all beside is pebbly length of shore , }</l>
     <l n="189">And far as eye can reach , it can discern no more ? }</l>
     <l n="190">Yet sometimes comes a ruffling cloud , to make 190</l>
     <l n="191">The quiet surface of the ocean shake ;</l>
     <l n="192">As an awaken 'd giant with a frown</l>
     <l n="193">Might show his wrath , and then to sleep sink down .</l>
     <l n="194">View now the winter-storm , above , one cloud ,</l>
     <l n="195">Black and unbroken , all the skies o'ershroud .</l>
     <l n="196">Th ’ unwieldy porpoise through the day before</l>
     <l n="197">Had roll 'd in view of boding men on shore ;</l>
     <l n="198">And sometimes hid , and sometimes show 'd , his form ,</l>
     <l n="199">Dark as the cloud , and furious as the storm .</l>
     <l n="200">All where the eye delights , yet dreads , to roam , 200</l>
     <l n="201">The breaking billows cast the flying foam</l>
     <l n="202">Upon the billows rising — all the deep</l>
     <l n="203">Is restless change ; the waves so swell 'd and steep ,</l>
     <l n="204">Breaking and sinking , and the sunken swells ,</l>
     <l n="205">Nor one , one moment , in its station dwells .</l>
     <l n="206">But , nearer land , you may the billows trace ,</l>
     <l n="207">As if contending in their watery chase ;</l>
     <l n="208">May watch the mightiest till the shoal they reach ,</l>
     <l n="209">Then break and hurry to their utmost stretch ;</l>
     <l n="210">Curl 'd as they come , they strike with furious force , 210</l>
     <l n="211">And then , re-flowing , take their grating course ,</l>
     <l n="212">Raking the rounded flints , which ages past</l>
     <l n="213">Roll 'd by their rage , and shall to ages last .</l>
     <l n="214">Far off , the petrel in the troubled way</l>
     <l n="215">Swims with her brood , or flutters in the spray ;</l>
     <l n="216">She rises often , often drops again ,</l>
     <l n="217">And sports at ease on the tempestuous main .</l>
     <l n="218">High o'er the restless deep , above the reach</l>
     <l n="219">Of gunner 's hope , vast flights of wild-ducks stretch ;</l>
     <l n="220">Far as the eye can glance on either side , 220</l>
     <l n="221">In a broad space and level line they glide ;</l>
     <l n="222">All in their wedge-like figures from the north ,</l>
     <l n="223">Day after day , flight after flight , go forth .</l>
     <l n="224">In-shore their passage tribes of sea-gulls urge ,</l>
     <l n="225">And drop for prey within the sweeping surge ;</l>
     <l n="226">Oft in the rough opposing blast they fly }</l>
     <l n="227">Far back , then turn , and all their force apply , }</l>
     <l n="228">While to the storm they give their weak complaining cry ; }</l>
     <l n="229">Or clap the sleek white pinion to the breast ,</l>
     <l n="230">And in the restless ocean dip for rest . 230</l>
     <l n="231">Darkness begins to reign ; the louder wind</l>
     <l n="232">Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind ;</l>
     <l n="233">But frights not him , whom evening and the spray</l>
     <l n="234">In part conceal — yon prowler on his way .</l>
     <l n="235">Lo ! he has something seen ; he runs apace ,</l>
     <l n="236">As if he fear 'd companion in the chase ;</l>
     <l n="237">He sees his prize , and now he turns again ,</l>
     <l n="238">Slowly and sorrowing — “ Was your search in vain ? ”</l>
     <l n="239">Gruffly he answers , “ ‘ Tis a sorry sight !</l>
     <l n="240">A seaman 's body ; there 'll be more to-night ! ” 240</l>
     <l n="241">Hark to those sounds ! they 're from distress at sea :</l>
     <l n="242">How quick they come ! What terrors may there be !</l>
     <l n="243">Yes , ‘ tis a driven vessel : I discern</l>
     <l n="244">Lights , signs of terror , gleaming from the stern ;</l>
     <l n="245">Others behold them too , and from the town</l>
     <l n="246">In various parties seamen hurry down ;</l>
     <l n="247">Their wives pursue , and damsels urged by dread ,</l>
     <l n="248">Lest men so dear be into danger led ;</l>
     <l n="249">Their head the gown has hooded , and their call</l>
     <l n="250">In this sad night is piercing like the squall ; 250</l>
     <l n="251">They feel their kinds of power , and when they meet ,</l>
     <l n="252">Chide , fondle , weep , dare , threaten , or entreat .</l>
     <l n="253">See one poor girl , all terror and alarm ,</l>
     <l n="254">Has fondly seized upon her lover 's arm ;</l>
     <l n="255">“ Thou shalt not venture ; ” and he answers “ No !</l>
     <l n="256">I will not ” — still she cries , “ Thou shalt not go . ”</l>
     <l n="257">No need of this ; not here the stoutest boat</l>
     <l n="258">Can through such breakers , o'er such billows float ;</l>
     <l n="259">Yet may they view these lights upon the beach ,</l>
     <l n="260">Which yield them hope , whom help can never reach . 260</l>
     <l n="261">From parted clouds the moon her radiance throws</l>
     <l n="262">On the wild waves , and all the danger shows ;</l>
     <l n="263">But shows them beaming in her shining vest ,</l>
     <l n="264">Terrific splendour ! gloom in glory dress 'd !</l>
     <l n="265">This for a moment , and then clouds again</l>
     <l n="266">Hide every beam , and fear and darkness reign .</l>
     <l n="267">But hear we now those sounds ? Do lights appear ?</l>
     <l n="268">I see them not ! the storm alone I hear :</l>
     <l n="269">And lo ! the sailors homeward take their way ;</l>
     <l n="270">Man must endure — let us submit and pray . 270</l>
     <l n="271">Such are our winter-views ; but night comes on —</l>
     <l n="272">Now business sleeps , and daily cares are gone ;</l>
     <l n="273">Now parties form , and some their friends assist</l>
     <l n="274">To waste the idle hours at sober whist ;</l>
     <l n="275">The tavern 's pleasure or the concert 's charm</l>
     <l n="276">Unnumber 'd moments of their sting disarm ;</l>
     <l n="277">Play-bills and open doors a crowd invite ,</l>
     <l n="278">To pass off one dread portion of the night ;</l>
     <l n="279">And show and song and luxury combined</l>
     <l n="280">Lift off from man this burthen of mankind . 280</l>
     <l n="281">Others advent'rous walk abroad and meet</l>
     <l n="282">Returning parties pacing through the street ;</l>
     <l n="283">When various voices , in the dying day ,</l>
     <l n="284">Hum in our walks , and greet us in our way ;</l>
     <l n="285">When tavern-lights flit on from room to room ,</l>
     <l n="286">And guide the tippling sailor , staggering home :</l>
     <l n="287">There as we pass , the jingling bells betray</l>
     <l n="288">How business rises with the closing day :</l>
     <l n="289">Now walking silent , by the river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="290">The ear perceives the rippling of the tide ; 290</l>
     <l n="291">Or measured cadence of the lads who tow</l>
     <l n="292">Some enter 'd hoy , to fix her in her row ;</l>
     <l n="293">Or hollow sound , which from the parish-bell</l>
     <l n="294">To some departed spirit bids farewell !</l>
     <l n="295">Thus shall you something of our BOROUGH know ,</l>
     <l n="296">Far as a verse , with Fancy 's aid , can show ;</l>
     <l n="297">Of sea or river , of a quay or street ,</l>
     <l n="298">The best description must be incomplete ;</l>
     <l n="299">But when a happier theme [ succeeds ] , and when</l>
     <l n="300">Men are our subjects and the deeds of men ; 300</l>
     <l n="301">Then may we find the Muse in happier style ,</l>
     <l n="302">And we may sometimes sigh and sometimes smile .</l>

    <head>THE CHURCH .</head>
     <l n="1">“ What is a Church ? ” — Let Truth and Reason speak ,</l>
     <l n="2">They would reply , “ The faithful , pure , and meek ;</l>
     <l n="3">From Christian folds the one selected race ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of all professions , and in every place . ”</l>
     <l n="5">“ What is a Church ? ” — “ A flock , ” our vicar cries ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Whom bishops govern and whom priests advise ;</l>
     <l n="7">Wherein are various states and due degrees ,</l>
     <l n="8">The bench for honour , and the stall for ease ;</l>
     <l n="9">That ease be mine , which , after all his cares ,</l>
     <l n="10">The pious , peaceful prebendary shares . ” 10</l>
     <l n="11">“ What is a Church ? ” — Our honest sexton tells ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ ‘ Tis a tall building , with a tower and bells ;</l>
     <l n="13">Where priest and clerk with joint exertion strive</l>
     <l n="14">To keep the ardour of their flock alive :</l>
     <l n="15">That , by his periods eloquent and grave ;</l>
     <l n="16">This , by responses , and a well-set stave .</l>
     <l n="17">These for the living ; but , when life be fled ,</l>
     <l n="18">I toll myself the requiem for the dead . ”</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis to this Church I call thee , and that place</l>
     <l n="20">Where slept our fathers , when they 'd run their race . 20</l>
     <l n="21">We too shall rest , and then our children keep</l>
     <l n="22">Their road in life , and then , forgotten , sleep ;</l>
     <l n="23">Meanwhile the building slowly falls away ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , like the builders , will in time decay .</l>
     <l n="25">The old foundation — but it is not clear</l>
     <l n="26">When it was laid — you care not for the year :</l>
     <l n="27">On this , as parts decay 'd by time and storms ,</l>
     <l n="28">Arose these various disproportion 'd forms ;</l>
     <l n="29">Yet Gothic , all the learn 'd who visit us</l>
     <l n="30">( And our small wonders ) have decided thus : 30</l>
     <l n="31">“ Yon noble Gothic arch ; ” “ That Gothic door ; ”</l>
     <l n="32">So have they said ; of proof you 'll need no more .</l>
     <l n="33">Here large plain columns rise in solemn style :</l>
     <l n="34">You 'd love the gloom they make in either aile ,</l>
     <l n="35">When the sun 's rays , enfeebled as they pass</l>
     <l n="36">( And shorn of splendour ) through the storied glass ,</l>
     <l n="37">Faintly display the figures on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="38">Which pleased distinctly in their place before .</l>
     <l n="39">But , ere you enter , yon bold tower survey ,</l>
     <l n="40">Tall and entire , and venerably gray ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">For time has soften 'd what was harsh when new ,</l>
     <l n="42">And now the stains are all of sober hue —</l>
     <l n="43">The living stains which Nature 's hand alone ,</l>
     <l n="44">Profuse of life , pours forth upon the stone ,</l>
     <l n="45">For ever growing ; where the common eye</l>
     <l n="46">Can but the bare and rocky bed descry ,</l>
     <l n="47">There Science loves to trace her tribes minute ,</l>
     <l n="48">The juiceless foliage , and the tasteless fruit ;</l>
     <l n="49">There she perceives them round the surface creep ,</l>
     <l n="50">And , while they meet , their due distinction keep , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Mix 'd but not blended ; each its name retains ,</l>
     <l n="52">And these are Nature 's ever-during stains .</l>
     <l n="53">And would'st thou , artist , with thy tints and brush ,</l>
     <l n="54">Form shades like these ? Pretender , where thy blush ?</l>
     <l n="55">In three short hours shall thy presuming hand</l>
     <l n="56">Th ’ effect of three slow centuries command<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>?</l>
     <l n="57">Thou may'st thy various greens and grays contrive :</l>
     <l n="58">They are not lichens , nor like aught alive .—</l>
     <l n="59">But yet proceed , and when thy tints are lost ,</l>
     <l n="60">Fled in the shower , or crumbled by the frost ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">When all thy work is done away as clean</l>
     <l n="62">As if thou never spread'st thy gray and green :</l>
     <l n="63">Then may'st thou see how Nature 's work is done ,</l>
     <l n="64">How slowly true she lays her colours on ;</l>
     <l n="65">When her least speck upon the hardest flint</l>
     <l n="66">Has mark and form and is a living tint ,</l>
     <l n="67">And so embodied with the rock , that few</l>
     <l n="68">Can the small germ upon the substance view<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>.</l>
     <l n="69">Seeds , to our eye invisible , will find</l>
     <l n="70">On the rude rock the bed that fits their kind ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">There , in the rugged soil , they safely dwell ,</l>
     <l n="72">Till showers and snows the subtle atoms swell ,</l>
     <l n="73">And spread th ’ enduring foliage ;— then we trace</l>
     <l n="74">The freckled flower upon the flinty base ;</l>
     <l n="75">These all increase , till in unnoticed years</l>
     <l n="76">The stony tower as gray with age appears ;</l>
     <l n="77">With coats of vegetation , thinly spread ,</l>
     <l n="78">Coat above coat , the living on the dead .</l>
     <l n="79">These then dissolve to dust , and make a way</l>
     <l n="80">For bolder foliage , nursed by their decay ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">The long-enduring ferns in time will all</l>
     <l n="82">Die and depose their dust upon the wall ,</l>
     <l n="83">Where the wing 'd seed may rest , till many a flower</l>
     <l n="84">Show Flora 's triumph o'er the falling tower .</l>
     <l n="85">But ours yet stands , and has its bells renown 'd</l>

     <l n="90">From ten loud coppers when their clappers swing . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Enter 'd the Church , we to a tomb proceed ,</l>
     <l n="92">Whose names and titles few attempt to read ;</l>
     <l n="93">Old English letters , and those half pick 'd out ,</l>
     <l n="94">Leave us , unskilful readers , much in doubt .</l>
     <l n="95">Our sons shall see its more degraded state ;</l>
     <l n="96">The tomb of grandeur hastens to its fate ;</l>
     <l n="97">That marble arch , our sexton 's favourite show ,</l>
     <l n="98">With all those ruff 'd and painted pairs below —</l>
     <l n="99">The noble lady and the lord who rest</l>
     <l n="100">Supine , as courtly dame and warrior dress 'd — 100</l>
     <l n="101">All are departed from their state sublime ,</l>
     <l n="102">Mangled and wounded in their war with time ,</l>
     <l n="103">Colleagued with mischief ; here a leg is fled ,</l>
     <l n="104">And lo ! the baron with but half a head ;</l>
     <l n="105">Midway is cleft the arch ; the very base</l>
     <l n="106">Is batter 'd round and shifted from its place .</l>
     <l n="107">Wonder not , mortal , at thy quick decay —</l>
     <l n="108">See ! men of marble piece-meal melt away ;</l>
     <l n="109">When whose the image we no longer read ,</l>
     <l n="110">But monuments themselves memorials need<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>. 110</l>
     <l n="111">With few such stately proofs of grief or pride ,</l>
     <l n="112">By wealth erected , is our Church supplied ;</l>
     <l n="113">But we have mural tablets , every size ,</l>
     <l n="114">That wo could wish , or vanity devise .</l>
     <l n="115">Death levels man ,— the wicked and the just ,</l>
     <l n="116">The wise , the weak , lie blended in the dust ;</l>
     <l n="117">And by the honours dealt to every name ,</l>
     <l n="118">The king of terrors seems to level fame .</l>
     <l n="119">— See here lamented wives , and every wife</l>
     <l n="120">The pride and comfort of her husband 's life ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">Here to her spouse , with every virtue graced ,</l>
     <l n="122">His mournful widow has a trophy placed ;</l>
     <l n="123">And here ‘ tis doubtful if the duteous son ,</l>
     <l n="124">Or the good father , be in praise outdone .</l>
     <l n="125">This may be nature ; when our friends we lose ,</l>
     <l n="126">Our alter 'd feelings alter too our views ;</l>
     <l n="127">What in their tempers teased us or distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="128">Is , with our anger and the dead , at rest ;</l>
     <l n="129">And much we grieve , no longer trial made ,</l>
     <l n="130">For that impatience which we then display 'd ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">Now to their love and worth of every kind</l>
     <l n="132">A soft compunction turns th ’ afflicted mind ;</l>
     <l n="133">Virtues , neglected then , adored become ,</l>
     <l n="134">And graces slighted blossom on the tomb .</l>
     <l n="135">‘ Tis well ; but let not love nor grief believe</l>
     <l n="136">That we assent ( who neither loved nor grieve )</l>
     <l n="137">To all that praise which on the tomb is read ,</l>
     <l n="138">To all that passion dictates for the dead ;</l>
     <l n="139">But , more indignant , we the tomb deride ,</l>
     <l n="140">Whose bold inscription flattery sells to pride . 140</l>
     <l n="141">Read of this Burgess — on the stone appear ,</l>
     <l n="142">How worthy he ! how virtuous ! and how dear !</l>
     <l n="143">What wailing was there when his spirit fled , }</l>
     <l n="144">How mourn 'd his lady for her lord when dead , }</l>
     <l n="145">And tears abundant through the town were shed ; }</l>
     <l n="146">See ! he was liberal , kind , religious , wise ,</l>
     <l n="147">And free from all disgrace and all disguise ;</l>
     <l n="148">His sterling worth , which words cannot express ,</l>
     <l n="149">Lives with his friends , their pride and their distress .</l>
     <l n="150">All this of Jacob Holmes ? for his the name , 150</l>
     <l n="151">He thus kind , liberal , just , religious ?— shame !</l>
     <l n="152">What is the truth ? Old Jacob married thrice ;</l>
     <l n="153">He dealt in coals , and av'rice was his vice ;</l>
     <l n="154">He ruled the Borough when his year came on ,</l>
     <l n="155">And some forget , and some are glad he 's gone ;</l>
     <l n="156">For never yet with shilling could he part ,</l>
     <l n="157">But when it left his hand , it struck his heart .</l>
     <l n="158">Yet , here will love its last attentions pay ,</l>
     <l n="159">And place memorials on these beds of clay .</l>
     <l n="160">Large level stones lie flat upon the grave , 160</l>
     <l n="161">And half a century 's sun and tempest brave ;</l>
     <l n="162">But many an honest tear and heart-felt sigh</l>
     <l n="163">Have follow 'd those who now unnoticed lie ;</l>
     <l n="164">Of these what numbers rest on every side !</l>
     <l n="165">Without one token left by grief or pride ;</l>
     <l n="166">Their graves soon levell 'd to the earth , and then</l>
     <l n="167">Will other hillocks rise o'er other men ;</l>
     <l n="168">Daily the dead on the decay 'd are thrust ,</l>
     <l n="169">And generations follow , “ dust to dust . ”</l>
     <l n="170">Yes ! there are real mourners — I have seen 170</l>
     <l n="171">A fair , sad girl , mild , suffering , and serene ;</l>
     <l n="172">Attention ( through the day ) her duties claim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="173">And to be useful as resign 'd she aim 'd ;</l>
     <l n="174">Neatly she dress 'd , nor vainly seem 'd t ’ expect</l>
     <l n="175">Pity for grief , or pardon for neglect .</l>
     <l n="176">But , when her wearied parents sunk to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="177">She sought her place to meditate and weep :</l>
     <l n="178">Then to her mind was all the past display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="179">That faithful memory brings to sorrow 's aid :</l>
     <l n="180">For then she thought on one regretted youth , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Her tender trust , and his unquestion 'd truth ;</l>
     <l n="182">In ev'ry place she wander 'd where they 'd been ,</l>
     <l n="183">And sadly-sacred held the parting-scene ,</l>
     <l n="184">Where last for sea he took his leave — that place</l>
     <l n="185">With double interest would she nightly trace ;</l>
     <l n="186">For long the courtship was , and he would say ,</l>
     <l n="187">Each time he sail 'd ,— “ This once , and then the day . ”</l>
     <l n="188">Yet prudence tarried ; but , when last he went ,</l>
     <l n="189">He drew from pitying love a full consent .</l>
     <l n="190">Happy he sail 'd , and great the care she took , 190</l>
     <l n="191">That he should softly sleep , and smartly look ;</l>
     <l n="192">White was his better linen , and his check</l>
     <l n="193">Was made more trim than any on the deck ;</l>
     <l n="194">And every comfort men at sea can know</l>
     <l n="195">Was hers to buy , to make , and to bestow :</l>
     <l n="196">For he to Greenland sail 'd , and much she told ,</l>
     <l n="197">How he should guard against the climate 's cold ;</l>
     <l n="198">Yet saw not danger ; dangers he 'd withstood ,</l>
     <l n="199">Nor could she trace the fever in his blood .</l>
     <l n="200">His messmates smiled at flushings in his cheek , 200</l>
     <l n="201">And he too smiled , but seldom would he speak ;</l>
     <l n="202">For now he found the danger , felt the pain ,</l>
     <l n="203">With grievous symptoms he could not explain ;</l>
     <l n="204">Hope was awaken 'd , as for home he sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="205">But quickly sank , and never more prevail 'd .</l>
     <l n="206">He call 'd his friend , and prefaced with a sigh</l>
     <l n="207">A lover 's message — “ Thomas , I must die .</l>
     <l n="208">Would I could see my Sally , and could rest</l>
     <l n="209">My throbbing temples on her faithful breast ,</l>
     <l n="210">And gazing go !— if not , this trifle take , 210</l>
     <l n="211">And say , till death I wore it for her sake .</l>
     <l n="212">Yes ! I must die — blow on , sweet breeze , blow on !</l>
     <l n="213">Give me one look , before my life be gone ,</l>
     <l n="214">Oh ! give me that , and let me not despair ,</l>
     <l n="215">One last fond look — and now repeat the prayer . ”</l>
     <l n="216">He had his wish , had more ; I will not paint</l>
     <l n="217">The lovers ’ meeting : she beheld him faint —</l>
     <l n="218">With tender fears she took a nearer view ,</l>
     <l n="219">Her terrors doubling as her hopes withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="220">He tried to smile , and , half succeeding , said , 220</l>
     <l n="221">“ Yes ! I must die ; ” and hope for ever fled .</l>
     <l n="222">Still long she nursed him : tender thoughts meantime</l>
     <l n="223">Were interchanged , and hopes and views sublime .</l>
     <l n="224">To her he came to die , and every day</l>
     <l n="225">She took some portion of the dread away ;</l>
     <l n="226">With him she pray 'd , to him his Bible read ,</l>
     <l n="227">Soothed the faint heart , and held the aching head .</l>
     <l n="228">She came with smiles the hour of pain to cheer ;</l>
     <l n="229">Apart , she sigh 'd ; alone , she shed the tear ;</l>
     <l n="230">Then , as if breaking from a cloud , she gave 230</l>
     <l n="231">Fresh light , and gilt the prospect of the grave .</l>
     <l n="232">One day he lighter seem 'd , and they forgot</l>
     <l n="233">The care , the dread , the anguish of their lot ;</l>
     <l n="234">They spoke with cheerfulness , and seem 'd to think ,</l>
     <l n="235">Yet said not so — “ Perhaps he will not sink . ”</l>
     <l n="236">A sudden brightness in his look appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="237">A sudden vigour in his voice was heard ;—</l>
     <l n="238">She had been reading in the Book of Prayer ,</l>
     <l n="239">And led him forth , and placed him in his chair ;</l>
     <l n="240">Lively he seem 'd , and spoke of all he knew , 240</l>
     <l n="241">The friendly many , and the favourite few ;</l>
     <l n="242">Nor one that day did he to mind recall</l>
     <l n="243">But she has treasured , and she loves them all ;</l>
     <l n="244">When in her way she meets them , they appear</l>
     <l n="245">Peculiar people — death has made them dear .</l>
     <l n="246">He named his friend , but then his hand she press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="247">And fondly whisper 'd , “ Thou must go to rest ; ”</l>
     <l n="248">“ I go , ” he said ; but , as he spoke , she found</l>
     <l n="249">His hand more cold , and fluttering was the sound !</l>
     <l n="250">Then gazed affrighten 'd ; but she caught a last , 250</l>
     <l n="251">A dying look of love — and all was past !</l>
     <l n="252">She placed a decent stone his grave above ,</l>
     <l n="253">Neatly engraved — an offering of her love ;</l>
     <l n="254">For that she wrought , for that forsook her bed ,</l>
     <l n="255">Awake alike to duty and the dead ;</l>
     <l n="256">She would have grieved , had friends presumed to spare</l>
     <l n="257">The least assistance — ‘ twas her proper care .</l>
     <l n="258">Here will she come , and on the grave will sit ,</l>
     <l n="259">Folding her arms , in long abstracted fit ;</l>
     <l n="260">But if observer pass , will take her round , 260</l>
     <l n="261">And careless seem , for she would not be found ;</l>
     <l n="262">Then go again , and thus her hour employ ,</l>
     <l n="263">While visions please her , and while woes destroy .</l>
     <l n="264">Forbear , sweet maid ! nor be by fancy led</l>
     <l n="265">To hold mysterious converse with the dead ;</l>
     <l n="266">For sure at length thy [ thoughts ’ ] , thy [ spirit 's ] pain</l>
     <l n="267">In this sad conflict will disturb thy brain .</l>
     <l n="268">All have their tasks and trials ; thine are hard ,</l>
     <l n="269">But short the time , and glorious the reward :</l>
     <l n="270">Thy patient spirit to thy duties give ; 270</l>

   <p>This kind of vegetation , as it begins upon siliceous stones , is very thin , and frequently not to be distinguished from the surface of the flint . The byssus jolithus of Linnaeus ( lepraria jolithus of the present system ) , an adhesive carmine crust on rocks and old buildings , was , even by scientific persons , taken for the substance on which it spread . A great variety of these minute vegetables are to be found in some parts of the coast , where the beach , formed of stones of various kinds , is undisturbed , and exposed to every change of weather ; in this situation the different species of lichen , in their different stages of growth , have an appearance interesting and agreeable even to those who are ignorant of , and indifferent to , the cause .</p>

   <p>It has been observed to me , that in the first part of the story I have represented this young woman as resigned and attentive to her duties ; from which it should appear that the concluding advice is unnecessary ; but if the reader will construe the expression “ to the living live , ” into the sense — “ live entirely for them , attend to duties only which are real , and not those imposed by the imagination , ” I shall have no need to alter the line which terminates the story .</p>

     <l n="6">To what famed college we our Vicar owe ,</l>
     <l n="7">To what fair county , let historians show .</l>
     <l n="8">Few now remember when the mild young man ,</l>
     <l n="9">Ruddy and fair , his Sunday-task began ;</l>
     <l n="10">Few live to speak of that soft soothing look</l>
     <l n="11">He cast around , as he prepared his book ; 10</l>
     <l n="12">It was a kind of supplicating smile ,</l>

     <l n="20">He was his Master 's soldier , but not one</l>
     <l n="21">To lead an army of his martyrs on : 20</l>
     <l n="22">Fear was his ruling passion ; yet was love ,</l>
     <l n="23">Of timid kind , once known his heart to move ;</l>
     <l n="24">It led his patient spirit where it paid</l>

     <l n="29">And paid the same attention to the two ;</l>
     <l n="30">Meeting and parting without joy or pain ,</l>
     <l n="31">He seem 'd to come that he might go again . 30</l>
     <l n="32">The wondering girl , no prude , but something nice ,</l>
     <l n="33">At length was chill 'd by his unmelting ice ;</l>
     <l n="34">She found her tortoise held such sluggish pace ,</l>
     <l n="35">That she must turn and meet him in the chase .</l>
     <l n="36">This not approving , she withdrew till one</l>
     <l n="37">Came who appeared with livelier hope to run ;</l>
     <l n="38">Who sought a readier way the heart to move ,</l>
     <l n="39">Than by faint dalliance of unfixing love .</l>
     <l n="40">Accuse me not that I approving paint</l>
     <l n="41">Impatient hope or love without restraint ; 40</l>
     <l n="42">Or think the passions , a tumultuous throng ,</l>
     <l n="43">Strong as they are , ungovernably strong :</l>
     <l n="44">But is the laurel to the soldier due ,</l>
     <l n="45">Who cautious comes not into danger 's view ?</l>
     <l n="46">What worth has virtue by desire untried ,</l>
     <l n="47">When Nature 's self enlists on duty 's side ?</l>
     <l n="48">The married dame in vain assail 'd the truth</l>
     <l n="49">And guarded bosom of the Hebrew youth ;</l>
     <l n="50">But with the daughter of the Priest of On</l>
     <l n="51">The love was lawful , and the guard was gone ; 50</l>
     <l n="52">But Joseph 's fame had lessen 'd in our view ,</l>
     <l n="53">Had he , refusing , fled the maiden too .</l>
     <l n="54">Yet our good priest to Joseph 's praise aspired ,</l>
     <l n="55">As once rejecting what his heart desired ;</l>
     <l n="56">“ I am escaped , ” he said , when none pursued ;</l>
     <l n="57">When none attack 'd him , “ I am unsubdued ; ”</l>
     <l n="58">“ Oh pleasing pangs of love , ” he sang again ,</l>
     <l n="59">Cold to the joy , and stranger to the pain .</l>
     <l n="60">Ev'n in his age would he address the young ,</l>
     <l n="61">“ I too have felt these fires , and they are strong ; ” 60</l>
     <l n="62">But from the time he left his favourite maid ,</l>
     <l n="63">To ancient females his devoirs were paid ;</l>
     <l n="64">And still they miss him after morning prayer ;</l>
     <l n="65">Nor yet successor fills the Vicar 's chair ,</l>
     <l n="66">Where kindred spirits in his praise agree ,</l>
     <l n="67">A happy few , as mild and cool as he —</l>
     <l n="68">The easy followers in the female train ,</l>
     <l n="69">Led without love , and captives without chain .</l>
     <l n="70">Ye lilies male ! think ( as your tea you sip ,</l>
     <l n="71">While the town small-talk flows from lip to lip ; 70</l>
     <l n="72">Intrigues half-gather 'd , conversation-scraps ,</l>
     <l n="73">Kitchen-cabals , and nursery-mishaps )</l>
     <l n="74">If the vast world may not some scene produce ,</l>
     <l n="75">Some state , where your small talents might have use .</l>
     <l n="76">Within seraglios you might harmless move ,</l>
     <l n="77">‘ Mid ranks of beauty , and in haunts of love ;</l>
     <l n="78">There from too daring man the treasures guard ,</l>
     <l n="79">An easy duty , and its own reward ;</l>
     <l n="80">Nature 's soft substitutes , you there might save</l>
     <l n="81">From crime the tyrant , and from wrong the slave . 80</l>
     <l n="82">But let applause be dealt in all we may :</l>
     <l n="83">Our priest was cheerful , and in season gay ;</l>
     <l n="84">His frequent visits seldom fail 'd to please ;</l>
     <l n="85">Easy himself , he sought his neighbour 's ease .</l>
     <l n="86">To a small garden with delight he came ,</l>
     <l n="87">And gave successive flowers a summer 's fame ;</l>
     <l n="88">These he presented with a grace his own</l>
     <l n="89">To his fair friends , and made their beauties known ,</l>
     <l n="90">Not without moral compliment : how they</l>
     <l n="91">“ Like flowers were sweet , and must like flowers decay . ” 90</l>
     <l n="92">Simple he was , and loved the simple truth ,</l>
     <l n="93">Yet had some useful cunning from his youth ;</l>
     <l n="94">A cunning never to dishonour lent ,</l>
     <l n="95">And rather for defence than conquest meant ;</l>
     <l n="96">‘ Twas fear of power , with some desire to rise ,</l>
     <l n="97">But not enough to make him enemies ;</l>
     <l n="98">He ever aim 'd to please ; and to offend</l>
     <l n="99">Was ever cautious ; for he sought a friend ;</l>
     <l n="100">Yet for the friendship never much would pay , }</l>
     <l n="101">Content to bow , be silent , and obey , 100 }</l>
     <l n="102">And by a soothing suff'rance find his way . }</l>
     <l n="103">Fiddling and fishing were his arts ; at times</l>
     <l n="104">He alter 'd sermons , and he aim 'd at rhymes ;</l>
     <l n="105">And his fair friends , not yet intent on cards ,</l>
     <l n="106">Oft he amused with riddles and charades .</l>
     <l n="107">Mild were his doctrines , and not one discourse</l>
     <l n="108">But gain 'd in softness what it lost in force :</l>
     <l n="109">Kind his opinions ; he would not receive</l>
     <l n="110">An ill report , nor evil act believe ;</l>
     <l n="111">“ If true , ‘ twas wrong ; but blemish great or small 110</l>
     <l n="112">Have all mankind ; yea , sinners are we all . ”</l>
     <l n="113">If ever fretful thought disturbed his breast ,</l>
     <l n="114">If aught of gloom that cheerful mind oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="115">It sprang from innovation ; it was then</l>
     <l n="116">He spake of mischief made by restless men ,</l>
     <l n="117">Not by new doctrines : never in his life</l>
     <l n="118">Would he attend to controversial strife ;</l>
     <l n="119">For sects he cared not ; “ They are not of us ,</l>
     <l n="120">Nor need we , brethren , their concerns discuss ;</l>
     <l n="121">But ‘ tis the change , the schism at home I feel ; 120</l>
     <l n="122">Ills few perceive , and none have skill to heal :</l>
     <l n="123">Not at the altar our young brethren read</l>
     <l n="124">( Facing their flock ) the decalogue and creed ;</l>
     <l n="125">But at their duty , in their desks they stand ,</l>
     <l n="126">With naked surplice , lacking hood and band :</l>
     <l n="127">Churches are now of holy song bereft ,</l>
     <l n="128">And half our ancient customs changed or left ;</l>
     <l n="129">Few sprigs of ivy are at Christmas seen ,</l>
     <l n="130">Nor crimson berry tips the holly 's green ;</l>
     <l n="131">Mistaken choirs refuse the solemn strain 130</l>
     <l n="132">Of ancient Sternhold , which from ours amain</l>
     <l n="133">[ Comes ] flying forth , from aile to aile about ,</l>
     <l n="134">Sweet links of harmony and long drawn out . ”</l>
     <l n="135">These were to him essentials , all things new</l>
     <l n="136">He deem 'd superfluous , useless , or untrue ;</l>
     <l n="137">To all beside indifferent , easy , cold ,</l>
     <l n="138">Here the fire kindled , and the wo was told .</l>
     <l n="139">Habit with him was all the test of truth ,</l>
     <l n="140">“ It must be right : I 've done it from my youth . ”</l>
     <l n="141">Questions he answer 'd in as brief a way , 140</l>
     <l n="142">“ It must be wrong — it was of yesterday . ”</l>
     <l n="143">Though mild benevolence our priest possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="144">‘ Twas but by wishes or by words express 'd :</l>
     <l n="145">Circles in water , as they wider flow ,</l>
     <l n="146">The less conspicuous , in their progress grow ;</l>
     <l n="147">And when at last they touch upon the shore ,</l>
     <l n="148">Distinction ceases , and they 're view 'd no more .</l>
     <l n="149">His love , like that last circle , all embraced ,</l>
     <l n="150">But with effect that never could be traced .</l>
     <l n="151">Now rests our Vicar . They who knew him best 150</l>
     <l n="152">Proclaim his life t ’ have been entirely rest —</l>
     <l n="153">Free from all evils which disturb his mind</l>
     <l n="154">Whom studies vex and controversies blind .</l>
     <l n="155">The rich approved — of them in awe he stood ;</l>
     <l n="156">The poor admired — they all believed him good ;</l>
     <l n="157">The old and serious of his habits spoke ;</l>
     <l n="158">The frank and youthful loved his pleasant joke ;</l>
     <l n="159">Mothers approved a safe contented guest ,</l>
     <l n="160">And daughters one who back 'd each small request :</l>
     <l n="161">In him his flock found nothing to condemn ; 160</l>
     <l n="162">Him sectaries liked — he never troubled them ;</l>
     <l n="163">No trifles fail 'd his yielding mind to please ,</l>
     <l n="164">And all his passions sunk in early ease ;</l>
     <l n="165">Nor one so old has left this world of sin ,</l>
     <l n="166">More like the being that he entered in .</l>

    <head>THE CURATE .</head>
     <l n="1">Ask you what lands our pastor tithes ?— Alas !</l>
     <l n="2">But few our acres , and but short our grass :</l>
     <l n="3">In some fat pastures of the rich , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="4">May roll the single cow or favourite steed ,</l>
     <l n="5">Who , stable-fed , is here for pleasure seen , 170</l>
     <l n="6">His sleek sides bathing in the dewy green :</l>
     <l n="7">But these , our hilly heath and common wide ,</l>
     <l n="8">Yield a slight portion for the parish-guide ;</l>
     <l n="9">No crops luxuriant in our borders stand ,</l>
     <l n="10">For here we plough the ocean , not the land ;</l>
     <l n="11">Still reason wills that we our pastor pay ,</l>
     <l n="12">And custom does it on a certain day .</l>
     <l n="13">Much is the duty , small the legal due ,</l>
     <l n="14">And this with grateful minds we keep in view ;</l>
     <l n="15">Each makes his off'ring , some by habit led , 180</l>
     <l n="16">Some by the thought , that all men must be fed ;</l>
     <l n="17">Duty and love , and piety and pride ,</l>
     <l n="18">have each their force , and for the priest provide .</l>
     <l n="19">Not thus our Curate , one whom all believe</l>
     <l n="20">Pious and just , and for whose fate they grieve ;</l>
     <l n="21">All see him poor , but ev'n the vulgar know</l>
     <l n="22">He merits love , and their respect bestow .</l>
     <l n="23">A man so learn 'd you shall but seldom see ,</l>
     <l n="24">Nor one so honour 'd , so aggrieved as he —</l>
     <l n="25">Not grieved by years alone ; though his appear 190</l>
     <l n="26">Dark and more dark , severer on severe :</l>
     <l n="27">Not in his need ,— and yet we all must grant</l>
     <l n="28">How painful ‘ tis for feeling age to want ;</l>
     <l n="29">Nor in his body 's sufferings — yet we know</l>
     <l n="30">Where time has plough 'd , there misery loves to sow :</l>
     <l n="31">But in the wearied mind , that all in vain</l>
     <l n="32">Wars with distress , and struggles with its pain .</l>
     <l n="33">His father saw his powers — “ I 'll give , ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="34">“ My first-born learning ; ‘ twill a portion be . ”</l>
     <l n="35">Unhappy gift ! a portion for a son ! 200</l>
     <l n="36">But all he had :— he learn 'd , and was undone !</l>
     <l n="37">Better , apprenticed to an humble trade ,</l>
     <l n="38">Had he the cassock for the priesthood made ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or thrown the shuttle , or the saddle shaped ,</l>
     <l n="40">And all these pangs of feeling souls escaped .</l>
     <l n="41">He once had hope — hope ardent , lively , light ;</l>
     <l n="42">His feelings pleasant , and his prospects bright :</l>
     <l n="43">Eager of fame , he read , he thought , he wrote ,</l>
     <l n="44">Weigh 'd the Greek page , and added note on note ;</l>
     <l n="45">At morn , at evening at his work was he , 210</l>
     <l n="46">And dream 'd what his Euripides would be .</l>
     <l n="47">Then care began ;— he loved , he woo 'd , he wed ;</l>
     <l n="48">Hope cheer 'd him still , and Hymen bless 'd his bed —</l>
     <l n="49">A Curate 's bed ! then came the woful years ,</l>
     <l n="50">The husband 's terrors , and the father 's tears ;</l>
     <l n="51">A wife grown feeble , mourning , pining , vex 'd ,</l>
     <l n="52">With wants and woes — by daily cares perplex 'd ;</l>
     <l n="53">No more a help , a smiling , soothing aid ,</l>
     <l n="54">But boding , drooping , sickly , and afraid .</l>
     <l n="55">A kind physician and without a fee , 220</l>
     <l n="56">Gave his opinion — “ Send her to the sea . ”</l>
     <l n="57">“ Alas ! ” the good man answer 'd , “ can I send</l>
     <l n="58">A friendless woman ? Can I find a friend ?</l>
     <l n="59">No ; I must with her , in her need , repair</l>
     <l n="60">To that new place ; the poor lie everywhere ;—</l>
     <l n="61">Some priest will pay me for my pious pains : ” —</l>
     <l n="62">He said , he came , and here he yet remains .</l>
     <l n="63">Behold his dwelling ; this poor hut he hires ,</l>
     <l n="64">Where he from view , though not from want , retires ;</l>
     <l n="65">Where four fair daughters , and five sorrowing sons , 230</l>
     <l n="66">Partake his sufferings , and dismiss his duns .</l>
     <l n="67">All join their efforts , and in patience learn</l>
     <l n="68">To want the comforts they aspire to earn ;</l>
     <l n="69">For the sick mother something they 'd obtain ,</l>
     <l n="70">To soothe her grief and mitigate her pain ;</l>
     <l n="71">For the sad father something they 'd procure ,</l>
     <l n="72">To ease the burthen they themselves endure .</l>
     <l n="73">Virtues like these at once delight and press</l>
     <l n="74">On the fond father with a proud distress ;</l>
     <l n="75">On all around he looks with care and love , 240</l>
     <l n="76">Grieved to behold , but happy to approve .</l>
     <l n="77">Then from his care , his love , his grief he steals ,</l>
     <l n="78">And by himself an author 's pleasure feels ;</l>
     <l n="79">Each line detains him , he omits not one ,</l>
     <l n="80">And all the sorrows of his state are gone .—</l>
     <l n="81">Alas ! ev'n then , in that delicious hour ,</l>
     <l n="82">He feels his fortune , and laments its power .</l>
     <l n="83">Some tradesman 's bill his wandering eyes engage ,</l>
     <l n="84">Some scrawl for payment , thrust ‘ twixt page and page ;</l>
     <l n="85">Some bold , loud rapping at his humble door , 250 }</l>
     <l n="86">Some surly message he has heard before , }</l>
     <l n="87">Awake , alarm , and tell him he is poor . }</l>
     <l n="88">An angry dealer , vulgar , rich , and proud ,</l>
     <l n="89">Thinks of his bill , and passing , raps aloud ;</l>
     <l n="90">The elder daughter meekly makes him way —</l>
     <l n="91">“ I want my money , and I cannot stay :</l>
     <l n="92">My mill is stopp 'd ; what , Miss ! I cannot grind ;</l>
     <l n="93">Go tell your father he must raise the wind . ”</l>
     <l n="94">Still trembling , troubled , the dejected maid</l>
     <l n="95">Says , “ Sir ! my father !— ” and then steps afraid : 260</l>
     <l n="96">Ev'n his hard heart is soften 'd , and he hears</l>
     <l n="97">Her voice with pity ; he respects her tears ;</l>
     <l n="98">His stubborn features half admit a smile ,</l>
     <l n="99">And his tone softens — “ Well ! I 'll wait awhile . ”</l>
     <l n="100">Pity , a man so good , so mild , so meek ,</l>
     <l n="101">At such an age , should have his bread to seek ;</l>
     <l n="102">And all those rude and fierce attacks to dread ,</l>
     <l n="103">That are more harrowing than the want of bread ;</l>
     <l n="104">Ah ! who shall whisper to that misery peace ,</l>
     <l n="105">And say that want and insolence shall cease ? 270</l>
     <l n="106">“ But why not publish ? ” — those who know too well ,</l>
     <l n="107">Dealers in Greek , are fearful ‘ twill not sell ;</l>
     <l n="108">Then he himself is timid , troubled , slow ,</l>
     <l n="109">Nor likes his labours nor his griefs to show ;</l>
     <l n="110">The hope of fame may in his heart have place ,</l>
     <l n="111">But he has dread and horror of disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="112">Nor has he that confiding , easy way ,</l>
     <l n="113">That might his learning and himself display ;</l>
     <l n="114">But to his work he from the world retreats ,</l>
     <l n="115">And frets and glories o'er the favourite sheets . 280</l>
     <l n="116">But see the man himself ; and sure I trace</l>
     <l n="117">Signs of new joy exulting in that face</l>
     <l n="118">O'er care that sleeps — we err , or we discern</l>
     <l n="119">Life in thy looks — the reason may we learn ?</l>
     <l n="120">“ Yes , ” he replied , “ I 'm happy , I confess ,</l>
     <l n="121">To learn that some are pleased with happiness</l>
     <l n="122">Which others feel — there are who now combine }</l>
     <l n="123">The worthiest natures in the best design , }</l>
     <l n="124">To aid the letter 'd poor , and soothe such ills as mine : }</l>
     <l n="125">We who more keenly feel the world 's contempt , 290</l>
     <l n="126">And from its miseries are the least exempt ;</l>
     <l n="127">Now hope shall whisper to the wounded breast ,</l>
     <l n="128">And grief , in soothing expectation , rest .</l>
     <l n="129">Yes , I am taught that men who think , who feel ,</l>
     <l n="130">Unite the pains of thoughtful men to heal ;</l>
     <l n="131">Not with disdainful pride , whose bounties make</l>
     <l n="132">The needy curse the benefits they take ;</l>
     <l n="133">Not with the idle vanity that knows</l>
     <l n="134">Only a selfish joy when it bestows ;</l>
     <l n="135">Not with o'erbearing wealth , that , in disdain , 300</l>
     <l n="136">Hurls the superfluous bliss at groaning pain ;</l>
     <l n="137">But these are men who yield such bless 'd relief</l>
     <l n="138">That with the grievance they destroy the grief ;</l>
     <l n="139">Their timely aid the needy sufferers find ,</l>
     <l n="140">Their generous manner soothes the suffering mind ;</l>
     <l n="141">Theirs is a gracious bounty , form 'd to raise</l>
     <l n="142">Him whom it aids ; their charity is praise ;</l>
     <l n="143">A common bounty may relieve distress ,</l>
     <l n="144">But whom the vulgar succour , they oppress ;</l>
     <l n="145">This , though a favour , is an honour too ; 310</l>
     <l n="146">Though mercy 's duty , yet ‘ tis merit 's due :</l>
     <l n="147">When our relief from such resources rise ,</l>
     <l n="148">All painful sense of obligation dies ;</l>
     <l n="149">And grateful feelings in the bosom wake ,</l>
     <l n="150">For ‘ tis their offerings , not their alms , we take .</l>
     <l n="151">Long may these founts of charity remain ,</l>
     <l n="152">And never shrink but to be fill 'd again ;</l>
     <l n="153">True ! to the author they are now confined , }</l>
     <l n="154">To him who gave the treasure of his mind , }</l>
     <l n="155">His time , his health , and thankless found mankind : 320 }</l>
     <l n="156">But there is hope that from these founts may flow</l>
     <l n="157">A sideway stream , and equal good bestow —</l>

     <l n="1">“ Sects in Religion ? ” — Yes , of every race</l>
     <l n="2">We nurse some portion in our favoured place ;</l>
     <l n="3">Not one warm preacher of one growing sect</l>
     <l n="4">Can say our Borough treats him with neglect ;</l>
     <l n="5">Frequent as fashions they with us appear ,</l>
     <l n="6">And you might ask , “ how think we for the year ? ”</l>
     <l n="7">They come to us as riders in a trade ,</l>
     <l n="8">And with much art exhibit and persuade .</l>
     <l n="9">Minds are for sects of various kinds decreed ,</l>
     <l n="10">As different soils are form 'd for diff'rent seed ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Some , when converted , sigh in sore amaze ,</l>
     <l n="12">And some are wrapt in joy 's ecstatic blaze ;</l>
     <l n="13">Others again will change to each extreme ,</l>
     <l n="14">They know not why — as hurried in a dream ;</l>
     <l n="15">Unstable they , like water , take all forms ,</l>
     <l n="16">Are quick and stagnant , have their calms and storms ;</l>
     <l n="17">High on the hills , they in the sunbeams glow ; }</l>
     <l n="18">Then muddily they move debased and slow , }</l>
     <l n="19">Or cold and frozen rest , and neither rise nor flow . }</l>
     <l n="20">Yet none the cool and prudent teacher prize ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">On him they dote who wakes their ecstasies ;</l>
     <l n="22">With passions ready primed such guide they meet ,</l>
     <l n="23">And warm and kindle with th ’ imparted heat ;</l>
     <l n="24">‘ Tis he who wakes the nameless strong desire ,</l>
     <l n="25">The melting rapture , and the glowing fire ;</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis he who pierces deep the tortured breast ,</l>
     <l n="27">And stirs the terrors , never more to rest .</l>
     <l n="28">Opposed to these we have a prouder kind ,</l>
     <l n="29">Rash without heat , and without raptures blind ;</l>
     <l n="30">These our Glad Tidings unconcern 'd peruse , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Search without awe , and without fear refuse ;</l>
     <l n="32">The truths , the blessings found in Sacred Writ ,</l>
     <l n="33">Call forth their spleen , and exercise their wit ;</l>
     <l n="34">Respect from these nor saints nor martyrs gain ;</l>
     <l n="35">The zeal they scorn , and they deride the pain ;</l>
     <l n="36">And take their transient , cool , contemptuous view ,</l>
     <l n="37">Of that which must be tried , and doubtless — may be true .</l>
     <l n="38">Friends of our faith we have , whom doubts like these ,</l>
     <l n="39">And keen remarks , and bold objections please ;</l>
     <l n="40">They grant such doubts have weaker minds oppress 'd , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Till sound conviction gave the troubled rest .</l>
     <l n="42">“ But still , ” they cry , “ let none their censures spare ;</l>

     <l n="45">With five-fold triumph sacred truth shall rise . ”</l>
     <l n="46">Yes ! I allow , so truth shall stand at last ,</l>
     <l n="47">And gain fresh glory by the conflict past —</l>
     <l n="48">As Solway-Moss ( a barren mass and cold ,</l>
     <l n="49">Death to the seed , and poison to the fold ,)</l>
     <l n="50">The smiling plain and fertile vale o'erlaid , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Choked the green sod , and kill 'd the springing blade ;</l>
     <l n="52">That , changed by culture , may in time be seen ,</l>
     <l n="53">Enrich 'd by golden grain , and pasture green ;</l>
     <l n="54">And these fair acres , rented and enjoy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="55">May those excel by Solway-Moss destroyed<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>.</l>
     <l n="56">Still must have mourn 'd the tenant of the day ,</l>
     <l n="57">For hopes destroy 'd and harvests swept away ;</l>
     <l n="58">To him the gain of future years unknown ,</l>
     <l n="59">The instant grief and suffering were his own .</l>
     <l n="60">So must I grieve for many a wounded heart , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Chill 'd by those doubts which bolder minds impart :</l>
     <l n="62">Truth in the end shall shine divinely clear ,</l>
     <l n="63">But sad the darkness till those times appear ;</l>
     <l n="64">Contests for truth , as wars for freedom , yield</l>
     <l n="65">Glory and joy to those who gain the field ;</l>
     <l n="66">But still the Christian must in pity sigh</l>
     <l n="67">For all who suffer , and uncertain die .</l>
     <l n="68">Here are , who all the Church maintains approve ,</l>
     <l n="69">But yet the Church herself they will not love ;</l>
     <l n="70">In angry speech , they blame the carnal tie , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Which pure Religion lost her spirit by ;</l>
     <l n="72">What time from prisons , flames , and tortures led ,</l>
     <l n="73">She slumber 'd careless in a royal bed ;</l>
     <l n="74">To make , they add , the Churches ’ glory shine .</l>
     <l n="75">Should Diocletian reign , not Constantine .</l>
     <l n="76">“ In pomp , ” they cry , “ is England 's Church array 'd ;</l>
     <l n="77">Her cool reformers wrought like men afraid .</l>
     <l n="78">We would have pull 'd her gorgeous temples down ,</l>
     <l n="79">And spurn 'd her mitre , and defiled her gown ;</l>
     <l n="80">We would have trodden low both bench and stall , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Nor left a tithe remaining , great or small . ”</l>
     <l n="82">Let us be serious .— Should such trials come ,</l>
     <l n="83">Are they themselves prepared for martyrdom ?</l>
     <l n="84">It seems to us that our reformers knew</l>
     <l n="85">Th ’ important work they undertook to do ;</l>
     <l n="86">An equal priesthood they were loth to try ,</l>
     <l n="87">Lest zeal and care should with ambition die ;</l>
     <l n="88">To them it seem 'd that , take the tenth away ,</l>
     <l n="89">Yet priests must eat , and you must feed or pay :</l>
     <l n="90">Would they indeed , who hold such pay in scorn , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Put on the muzzle when they tread the corn ?</l>
     <l n="92">Would they , all gratis , watch and tend the fold ,</l>
     <l n="93">Nor take one fleece to keep them from the cold ?</l>
     <l n="94">Men are not equal , and ‘ tis meet and right</l>
     <l n="95">That robes and titles our respect excite ;</l>
     <l n="96">Order requires it ; ‘ tis by vulgar pride</l>
     <l n="97">That such regard is censured and denied ,</l>
     <l n="98">Or by that false enthusiastic zeal ,</l>
     <l n="99">That thinks the spirit will the priest reveal ,</l>
     <l n="100">And show to all men , by their powerful speech , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Who are appointed and inspired to teach .</l>
     <l n="102">Alas ! could we the dangerous rule believe ,</l>
     <l n="103">Whom for their teacher should the crowd receive ?</l>
     <l n="104">Since all the varying kinds demand respect ,</l>
     <l n="105">All press you on to join their chosen sect ,</l>
     <l n="106">Although but in this single point agreed ,</l>
     <l n="107">“ Desert your churches and adopt our creed . ”</l>
     <l n="108">We know full well how much our forms offend</l>
     <l n="109">The burthen 'd Papist and the simple Friend —</l>
     <l n="110">Him who new robes for every service takes , 110</l>
     <l n="111">And who in drab and beaver sighs and shakes .</l>
     <l n="112">He on the priest , whom hood and band adorn ,</l>
     <l n="113">Looks with the sleepy eye of silent scorn ;</l>
     <l n="114">But him I would not for my friend and guide ,</l>
     <l n="115">Who views such things with spleen , or wears with pride .</l>
     <l n="116">See next our several sects — but first behold</l>
     <l n="117">The Church of Rome , who here is poor and old :</l>
     <l n="118">Use not triumphant rail'ry , or , at least ,</l>
     <l n="119">Let not thy mother be a whore and beast .</l>
     <l n="120">Great was her pride indeed in ancient times ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">Yet shall we think of nothing but her crimes ?</l>
     <l n="122">Exalted high above all earthly things ,</l>
     <l n="123">She placed her foot upon the neck of kings ;</l>
     <l n="124">But some have deeply since avenged the crown ,</l>
     <l n="125">And thrown her glory and her honours down ;</l>
     <l n="126">Nor neck nor ear can she of kings command ,</l>
     <l n="127">Nor place a foot upon her own fair land .</l>
     <l n="128">Among her sons , with us a quiet few ,</l>
     <l n="129">Obscure themselves , her ancient state review ;</l>
     <l n="130">And fond and melancholy glances cast 130</l>
     <l n="131">On power insulted , and on triumph pass 'd :</l>
     <l n="132">They look , they can but look , with many a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="133">On sacred buildings doom 'd in dust to lie ;</l>
     <l n="134">“ On seats , ” they tell , “ where priests ‘ mid tapers dim</l>
     <l n="135">Breathed the warm prayer , or tuned the midnight hymn ;</l>
     <l n="136">Where trembling penitents their guilt confess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="137">Where want had succour , and contrition rest .</l>
     <l n="138">There weary men from trouble found relief ,</l>
     <l n="139">There men in sorrow found repose from grief ;</l>
     <l n="140">To scenes like these the fainting soul retired ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Revenge and anger in these cells expired ;</l>
     <l n="142">By pity soothed , remorse lost half her fears ,</l>
     <l n="143">And soften 'd pride dropp 'd penitential tears .</l>
     <l n="144">Then convent-walls and nunnery-spires arose ,</l>
     <l n="145">In pleasant spots which monk or abbot chose ;</l>
     <l n="146">When counts and barons saints devoted fed ,</l>
     <l n="147">And , making cheap exchange , had pray'r for bread .</l>
     <l n="148">Now all is lost ; the earth where abbeys stood</l>
     <l n="149">Is layman 's land , the glebe , the stream , the wood ;</l>
     <l n="150">His oxen low where monks retired to eat ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">His cows repose upon the prior 's seat ;</l>
     <l n="152">And wanton doves within the cloisters bill ,</l>
     <l n="153">Where the chaste votary warr 'd with wanton will . ”</l>
     <l n="154">Such is the change they mourn , but they restrain</l>
     <l n="155">The rage of grief , and passively complain .</l>
     <l n="156">We 've Baptists old and new ; forbear to ask</l>
     <l n="157">What the distinction — I decline the task .</l>
     <l n="158">This I perceive , that , when a sect grows old ,</l>
     <l n="159">Converts are few , and the converted cold :</l>
     <l n="160">First comes the hot-bed heat , and , while it glows , 160</l>
     <l n="161">The plants spring up , and each with vigour grows ;</l>
     <l n="162">Then comes the cooler day , and , though awhile</l>
     <l n="163">The verdure prospers and the blossoms smile ,</l>
     <l n="164">Yet poor the fruit , and form 'd by long delay ,</l>
     <l n="165">Nor will the profits for the culture pay ;</l>
     <l n="166">The skilful gard'ner then no longer stops ,</l>
     <l n="167">But turns to other beds for bearing crops .</l>
     <l n="168">Some Swedenborgians in our streets are found ,</l>
     <l n="169">Those wandering walkers on enchanted ground ;</l>
     <l n="170">Who in our world can other worlds survey , 170</l>

     <l n="172">Of Bible-mysteries they the keys possess ,</l>

     <l n="174">‘ Tis theirs to see — around , about , above —</l>
     <l n="175">How spirits mingle thoughts , and angels move ;</l>
     <l n="176">Those whom our grosser views from us exclude ,</l>
     <l n="177">To them appear a heavenly multitude ;</l>
     <l n="178">While the dark sayings , seal 'd to men like us ,</l>
     <l n="179">Their priests interpret , and their flocks discuss .</l>
     <l n="180">But while these gifted men , a favoured fold , 180</l>
     <l n="181">New powers exhibit and new worlds behold ;</l>
     <l n="182">Is there not danger lest their minds confound</l>
     <l n="183">The pure above them with the gross around ?</l>
     <l n="184">May not these Phaetons , who thus contrive</l>

     <l n="186">When from their flaming chariots they descend ,</l>
     <l n="187">The worlds they visit in their fancies blend ?</l>
     <l n="188">Alas ! too sure on both they bring disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="189">Their earth is crazy , and their heav'n is base .</l>
     <l n="190">We have , it seems , who treat , and doubtless well , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Of a chastising , not awarding hell ;</l>
     <l n="192">Who are assured that an offended God</l>
     <l n="193">Will cease to use the thunder and the rod ;</l>
     <l n="194">A soul on earth , by crime and folly stain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="195">When here corrected , has improvement gain 'd —</l>
     <l n="196">In other state still more improved to grow ,</l>
     <l n="197">And nobler powers in happier world to know ;</l>
     <l n="198">New strength to use in each divine employ ,</l>
     <l n="199">And , more enjoying , looking to more joy .</l>
     <l n="200">A pleasing vision ! could we thus be sure 200</l>
     <l n="201">Polluted souls would be at length so pure ;</l>
     <l n="202">The view is happy , we may think it just ,</l>
     <l n="203">It may be true — but who shall add it must ?</l>
     <l n="204">To the plain words and sense of sacred writ ,</l>
     <l n="205">With all my heart I reverently submit ;</l>
     <l n="206">But , where it leaves me doubtful , I 'm afraid</l>
     <l n="207">To call conjecture to my reason 's aid ;</l>

    <head>THE ELECTION .</head>
     <l n="1">Yes , our Election 's past , and we 've been free ,</l>
     <l n="2">Somewhat as madmen without keepers be ;</l>
     <l n="3">And such desire of freedom has been shown ,</l>
     <l n="4">That both the parties wish 'd her all their own :</l>
     <l n="5">All our free smiths and cobblers in the town</l>
     <l n="6">Were loth to lay such pleasant freedom down —</l>
     <l n="7">To put the bludgeon and cockade aside ,</l>
     <l n="8">And let us pass unhurt and undefied .</l>
     <l n="9">True ! you might then your party 's sign produce ,</l>
     <l n="10">And so escape with only half th ’ abuse — 10</l>
     <l n="11">With half the danger as you walk 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="12">With rage and threat'ning but from half the throng .</l>
     <l n="13">This you might do , and not your fortune mend ;</l>
     <l n="14">For where you lost a foe , you gain 'd a friend ;</l>
     <l n="15">And , to distress you , vex you , and expose ,</l>
     <l n="16">Election-friends are worse than any foes ;</l>
     <l n="17">The party-curse is with the canvass past ,</l>
     <l n="18">But party-friendship , for your grief , will last .</l>
     <l n="19">Friends of all kinds , the civil and the rude ,</l>
     <l n="20">Who humbly wish , or boldly dare t ’ intrude : 20</l>
     <l n="21">These beg or take a liberty to come</l>
     <l n="22">( Friends should be free ) , and make your house their home ;</l>
     <l n="23">They know that warmly you their cause espouse ,</l>
     <l n="24">And come to make their boastings and their bows .</l>
     <l n="25">You scorn their manners , you their words mistrust ;</l>
     <l n="26">But you must hear them , and they know you must .</l>
     <l n="27">One plainly sees a friendship firm and true</l>
     <l n="28">Between the noble candidate and you ;</l>
     <l n="29">So humbly begs ( and states at large the case ) ,</l>
     <l n="30">“ You 'll think of Bobby and the little place . ” 30</l>
     <l n="31">Stifling his shame by drink , a wretch will come ,</l>
     <l n="32">And prate your wife and daughter from the room :</l>
     <l n="33">In pain you hear him , and at heart despise ,</l>
     <l n="34">Yet with heroic mind your pangs disguise ;</l>
     <l n="35">And still in patience to the sot attend ,</l>
     <l n="36">To show what man can bear to serve a friend .</l>
     <l n="37">One enters hungry — not to be denied ,</l>
     <l n="38">And takes his place and jokes — “ We 're of a side . ”</l>
     <l n="39">Yet worse , the proser who , upon the strength</l>
     <l n="40">Of his one vote , has tales of three hours ’ length — 40</l>
     <l n="41">This sorry rogue you bear , yet with surprise</l>
     <l n="42">Start at his oaths , and sicken at his lies .</l>
     <l n="43">Then comes there one , and tells in friendly way ,</l>
     <l n="44">What the opponents in their anger say ;</l>
     <l n="45">All that through life has vex 'd you , all abuse ,</l>
     <l n="46">Will this kind friend in pure regard produce ;</l>
     <l n="47">And , having through your own offences run ,</l>
     <l n="48">Adds ( as appendage ) what your friends have done .</l>
     <l n="49">Has any female cousin made a trip</l>
     <l n="50">To Gretna-Green , or more vexatious slip ? 50</l>
     <l n="51">Has your wife 's brother , or your uncle 's son ,</l>
     <l n="52">Done aught amiss , or is he thought t ’ have done ?</l>
     <l n="53">Is there of all your kindred some who lack</l>
     <l n="54">Vision direct , or have a gibbous back ?</l>
     <l n="55">From your unlucky name may quips and puns</l>
     <l n="56">Be made by these upbraiding Goths and Huns ?</l>
     <l n="57">To some great public character have you</l>
     <l n="58">Assign 'd the fame to worth and talents due ,</l>
     <l n="59">Proud of your praise ?— In this , in any case ,</l>
     <l n="60">Where the brute-spirit may affix disgrace , 60</l>
     <l n="61">These friends will smiling bring it , and the while</l>
     <l n="62">You silent sit , and practise for a smile .</l>
     <l n="63">Vain of their power , and of their value sure ,</l>
     <l n="64">They nearly guess the tortures you endure ;</l>
     <l n="65">Nor spare one pang — for they perceive your heart</l>
     <l n="66">Goes with the cause ; you 'd die before you 'd start ;</l>
     <l n="67">Do what they may , they 're sure you 'll not offend</l>
     <l n="68">Men who have pledged their honours to your friend .</l>
     <l n="69">Those friends indeed , who start as in a race ,</l>
     <l n="70">May love the sport , and laugh at this disgrace ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">They have in view the glory and the prize ,</l>
     <l n="72">Nor heed the dirty steps by which they rise :</l>
     <l n="73">But we , their poor associates , lose the fame ,</l>
     <l n="74">Though more than partners in the toil and shame .</l>
     <l n="75">Were this the whole , and did the time produce</l>
     <l n="76">But shame and toil , but riot and abuse :</l>
     <l n="77">We might be then from serious griefs exempt ,</l>
     <l n="78">And view the whole with pity and contempt ,</l>
     <l n="79">Alas ! but here the vilest passions rule ;</l>
     <l n="80">It is Seduction 's , is Temptation 's school : 80</l>
     <l n="81">Where vices mingle in the oddest ways ,</l>
     <l n="82">The grossest slander and the dirtiest praise ;</l>
     <l n="83">Flattery enough to make the vainest sick ,</l>
     <l n="84">And clumsy stratagem , and scoundrel trick .</l>
     <l n="85">Nay more , your anger and contempt to cause ,</l>
     <l n="86">These , while they fish for profit , claim applause ;</l>
     <l n="87">Bribed , bought and bound , they banish shame and fear ;</l>
     <l n="88">Tell you they 're stanch , and have a soul sincere ;</l>
     <l n="89">Then talk of honour , and , if doubt 's express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="90">Show where it lies , and smite upon the breast . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Among these worthies , some at first declare</l>
     <l n="92">For whom they vote ; he then has most to spare .</l>
     <l n="93">Others hang off — when coming to the post</l>
     <l n="94">Is spurring time , and then he 'll spare the most ;</l>
     <l n="95">While some , demurring , wait , and find at last</l>
     <l n="96">The bidding languish , and the market pass 'd ;</l>
     <l n="97">These will affect all bribery to condemn ,</l>
     <l n="98">And , be it Satan laughs , he laughs at them .</l>
     <l n="99">Some too are pious — one desired the Lord</l>
     <l n="100">To teach him where “ to drop his little word ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">To lend his vote , where it will profit best ;</l>
     <l n="102">Promotion came not from the east or west ;</l>
     <l n="103">But as their freedom had promoted some ,</l>
     <l n="104">He should be glad to know which way ‘ twould come ,</l>
     <l n="105">It was a naughty world , and , where to sell</l>
     <l n="106">His precious charge , was more than he could tell . ”</l>
     <l n="107">“ But you succeeded ? ” — true , at mighty cost ;</l>
     <l n="108">And our good friend , I fear , will think he 's lost .</l>
     <l n="109">Inns , horses , chaises , dinners , balls and notes ;</l>
     <l n="110">What fill 'd their purses , and what drench 'd their throats ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">The private pension , and indulgent lease ,</l>
     <l n="112">Have all been granted to these friends who fleece —</l>
     <l n="113">Friends who will hang like burs upon his coat ,</l>
     <l n="114">And boundless judge the value of a vote .</l>
     <l n="115">And , though the terrors of the time be pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="116">There still remain the scatterings of the blast .</l>
     <l n="117">The boughs are parted that entwined before ,</l>
     <l n="118">And ancient harmony exists no more ;</l>
     <l n="119">The gusts of wrath our peaceful seats deform ,</l>
     <l n="120">And sadly flows the sighing of the storm : 120</l>
     <l n="121">Those who have gain 'd are sorry for the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="122">But they who lost unwilling peace should come ;</l>
     <l n="123">There open envy , here suppress 'd delight ,</l>
     <l n="124">Yet live till time shall better thoughts excite ,</l>
     <l n="125">And so prepare us , by a six-years ’ truce ,</l>
     <l n="126">Again for riot , insult , and abuse .</l>
     <l n="127">Our worthy mayor , on the victorious part ,</l>
     <l n="128">Cries out for peace , and cries with all his heart ;</l>
     <l n="129">He , civil creature ! ever does his best ,</l>
     <l n="130">To banish wrath from every voter 's breast ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">“ For where , ” says he , with reason strong and plain ,</l>
     <l n="132">“ Where is the profit ? what will anger gain ? ”</l>
     <l n="133">His short stout person he is wont to brace</l>
     <l n="134">In good brown broad-cloth , edged with two-inch lace ,</l>
     <l n="135">When in his seat ; and still the coat seems new ,</l>
     <l n="136">Preserved by common use of seaman 's blue .</l>
     <l n="137">He was a fisher from his earliest day ,</l>
     <l n="138">And placed his nets within the Borough 's bay ;</l>
     <l n="139">Where by his skates , his herrings , and his soles ,</l>
     <l n="140">He lived , nor dream 'd of corporation-doles<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span>; 140</l>
     <l n="141">But , toiling , saved and , saving , never ceased</l>
     <l n="142">Till he had box 'd up twelve score pounds at least .</l>
     <l n="143">He knew not money 's power , but judged it best</l>
     <l n="144">Safe in his trunk to let his treasure rest ;</l>
     <l n="145">Yet to a friend complain 'd : “ Sad charge , to keep</l>
     <l n="146">So many pounds , and then I cannot sleep . ”</l>
     <l n="147">“ Then put it out , ” replied the friend .— “ What , give</l>
     <l n="148">My money up ? why , then I could not live . ” —</l>
     <l n="149">“ Nay , but for interest place it in his hands ,</l>
     <l n="150">Who 'll give you mortgage on his house or lands . ” — 150</l>
     <l n="151">“ Oh but , ” said Daniel , “ that 's a dangerous plan ;</l>
     <l n="152">He may be robb 'd like any other man . ” —</l>
     <l n="153">“ Still he is bound , and you may be at rest ,</l>
     <l n="154">More safe the money than within your chest ;</l>
     <l n="155">And you 'll receive , from all deductions clear ,</l>
     <l n="156">Five pounds for every hundred , every year . ” —</l>
     <l n="157">“ What good in that ? ” quoth Daniel , “ for ‘ tis plain ,</l>
     <l n="158">If part I take , there can but part remain . ” —</l>
     <l n="159">“ What ! you , my friend , so skill 'd in gainful things ,</l>
     <l n="160">Have you to learn what interest money brings ? ” — 160</l>
     <l n="161">“ Not so , ” said Daniel , “ perfectly I know ,</l>
     <l n="162">He 's the most interest who has most to show . ” —</l>
     <l n="163">“ True ! and he 'll show the more , the more he lends ;</l>
     <l n="164">Thus he his weight and consequence extends ;</l>
     <l n="165">For they who borrow must restore each sum ,</l>
     <l n="166">And pay for use — What , Daniel , art thou dumb ? ”</l>
     <l n="167">For much amazed was that good man — “ Indeed ! ”</l>
     <l n="168">Said he , with glad'ning eye , “ will money breed ?</l>
     <l n="169">How have I lived ? I grieve , with all my heart ,</l>
     <l n="170">For my late knowledge in this precious art :— 170</l>
     <l n="171">Five pounds for every hundred will he give ?</l>
     <l n="172">And then the hundred ?—— I begin to live . ” —</l>
     <l n="173">So he began , and other means he found ,</l>
     <l n="174">As he went on , to multiply a pound :</l>
     <l n="175">Though blind so long to interest , all allow</l>
     <l n="176">That no man better understands it now .</l>
     <l n="177">Him in our body-corporate we chose ,</l>
     <l n="178">And , once among us , he above us rose ;</l>
     <l n="179">Stepping from post to post , he reach 'd the chair ,</l>
     <l n="180">And there he now reposes — that 's the mayor . 180</l>
     <l n="181">But ‘ tis not he , ‘ tis not the kinder few ,</l>
     <l n="182">The mild , the good , who can our peace renew ;</l>
     <l n="183">A peevish humour swells in every eye ,</l>
     <l n="184">The warm are angry , and the cool are shy ;</l>
     <l n="185">There is no more the social board at whist .</l>
     <l n="186">The good old partners are with scorn dismiss 'd ;</l>
     <l n="187">No more with dog and lantern comes the maid ,</l>
     <l n="188">To guide the mistress when the rubber 's play 'd ;</l>
     <l n="189">Sad shifts are made , lest ribbons blue and green</l>
     <l n="190">Should at one table , at one time be seen . 190</l>
     <l n="191">On care and merit none will now rely ,</l>
     <l n="192">‘ Tis party sells what party-friends must buy ;</l>
     <l n="193">The warmest burgess wears a bodger 's coat ,</l>
     <l n="194">And fashion gains less int'rest than a vote ;</l>
     <l n="195">Uncheck 'd , the vintner still his poison vends ;</l>
     <l n="196">For he too votes , and can command his friends .</l>
     <l n="197">But , this admitted , be it still agreed ,</l>
     <l n="198">These ill effects from noble cause proceed ;</l>
     <l n="199">Though like some vile excrescences they be , }</l>
     <l n="200">The tree they spring from is a sacred tree , 200 }</l>
     <l n="201">And its true produce , strength and liberty . }</l>
     <l n="202">Yet if we could th ’ attendant ills suppress ;</l>
     <l n="203">If we could make the sum of mischief less ;</l>
     <l n="204">If we could warm and angry men persuade</l>
     <l n="205">No more man 's common comforts to invade ;</l>
     <l n="206">And that old ease and harmony re-seat</l>
     <l n="207">In all our meetings , so in joy to meet :</l>
     <l n="208">Much would of glory to the Muse ensue ,</l>
     <l n="209">And our good vicar would have less to do .</l>

   <p>I am informed that some explanation is here necessary , though I am ignorant for what class of my readers it can be required . Some corporate bodies have actual property , as appears by their receiving rents ; and they obtain money on the admission of members into their society : this they may lawfully share perhaps . There are , moreover , other doles , of still greater value , of which it is not necessary for me to explain the nature , or to inquire into the legality .</p>

     <l n="121">Jails , bailiffs , writs , all terms and threats of law ,</l>
     <l n="122">Grow now familiar as once top and taw ;</l>

     <l n="125">As feels the surgeon for the mangled limb ,</l>
     <l n="126">The mangled mind is but a job for him ;</l>
     <l n="127">Thus taught to think , these legal reasoners draw</l>
     <l n="128">Morals and maxims from their views of law ;</l>
     <l n="129">They cease to judge by precepts taught in schools ,</l>
     <l n="130">By man 's plain sense , or by religious rules ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">No ! nor by law itself , in truth discern 'd ,</l>
     <l n="132">But as its statutes may be warp 'd and turn 'd .</l>
     <l n="133">How they should judge of man , his word and deed ,</l>
     <l n="134">They in their books and not their bosoms read :</l>
     <l n="135">Of some good act you speak with just applause ,</l>

     <l n="137">Blame you some tyrant 's deed ?— he answers , “ Nay ,</l>
     <l n="138">He 'll get a verdict ; heed you what you say . ”</l>
     <l n="139">Thus , to conclusions from examples led ,</l>
     <l n="140">The heart resigns all judgment to the head ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Law , law alone , for ever kept in view ,</l>
     <l n="142">His measures guides , and rules his conscience too ;</l>
     <l n="143">Of ten commandments , he confesses three</l>
     <l n="144">Are yet in force , and tells you which they be ,</l>
     <l n="145">As law instructs him , thus : “ Your neighbour 's wife</l>

     <l n="163">As long as they can make the smaller profits flow ; }</l>

     <l n="165">When they perceive they 've drawn out every drop .</l>
     <l n="166">Yet , I repeat , there are , who nobly strive</l>
     <l n="167">To keep the sense of moral worth alive :</l>
     <l n="168">Men who would starve , ere meanly deign to live</l>
     <l n="169">On what deception and chican'ry give ;</l>
     <l n="170">And these at length succeed : they have their strife , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Their apprehensions , stops , and rubs in life ;</l>
     <l n="172">But honour , application , care , and skill ,</l>
     <l n="173">Shall bend opposing fortune to their will .</l>
     <l n="174">Of such is Archer , he who keeps in awe</l>
     <l n="175">Contending parties by his threats of law .</l>
     <l n="176">He , roughly honest , has been long a guide</l>
     <l n="177">In Borough-business , on the conquering side ;</l>
     <l n="178">And seen so much of both sides , and so long ,</l>
     <l n="179">He thinks the bias of man 's mind goes wrong .</l>
     <l n="180">Thus , though he 's friendly , he is still severe , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Surly though kind , suspiciously sincere :</l>
     <l n="182">So much he 's seen of baseness in the mind ,</l>
     <l n="183">That , while a friend to man , he scorns mankind ;</l>
     <l n="184">He knows the human heart , and sees with dread ,</l>
     <l n="185">By slight temptation , how the strong are led ;</l>
     <l n="186">He knows how interest can asunder rend</l>
     <l n="187">The bond of parent , master , guardian , friend ,</l>
     <l n="188">To form a new and a degrading tie</l>
     <l n="189">‘ Twixt needy vice and tempting villany .</l>
     <l n="190">Sound in himself , yet , when such flaws appear , 190</l>
     <l n="191">He doubts of all , and learns that self to fear :</l>
     <l n="192">For , where so dark the moral view is grown ,</l>
     <l n="193">A timid conscience trembles for her own ;</l>
     <l n="194">The pitchy taint of general vice is such</l>
     <l n="195">As daubs the fancy , and you dread the touch .</l>
     <l n="196">Far unlike him was one in former times ,</l>
     <l n="197">Famed for the spoil he gather 'd by his crimes ;</l>
     <l n="198">Who , while his brethren nibbling held their prey ,</l>
     <l n="199">He like an eagle seized and bore the whole away .</l>
     <l n="200">Swallow , a poor attorney , brought his boy 200</l>
     <l n="201">Up at his desk , and gave him his employ ;</l>
     <l n="202">He would have bound him to an honest trade ,</l>
     <l n="203">Could preparations have been duly made .</l>
     <l n="204">The clerkship ended , both the sire and son</l>
     <l n="205">Together did what business could be done ;</l>
     <l n="206">Sometimes they 'd luck to stir up small disputes</l>
     <l n="207">Among their friends , and raise them into suits .</l>
     <l n="208">Though close and hard , the father was content</l>
     <l n="209">With this resource , now old and indolent ;</l>
     <l n="210">But his young Swallow , gaping and alive 210</l>
     <l n="211">To fiercer feelings , was resolved to thrive :—</l>
     <l n="212">“ Father , ” he said , “ but little can they win</l>
     <l n="213">Who hunt in couples , where the game is thin ;</l>
     <l n="214">Let 's part in peace , and each pursue his gain</l>
     <l n="215">Where it may start — our love may yet remain . ”</l>
     <l n="216">The parent growl 'd , he could n't think that love</l>
     <l n="217">Made the young cockatrice his den remove ;</l>
     <l n="218">But , taught by habit , he the truth suppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="219">Forced a frank look , and said he “ thought it best . ”</l>
     <l n="220">Not long they 'd parted ere dispute arose ; 220</l>
     <l n="221">The game they hunted quickly made them foes .</l>
     <l n="222">Some house the father by his art had won</l>
     <l n="223">Seem 'd a fit cause of contest to the son :</l>
     <l n="224">Who raised a claimant , and then found a way</l>
     <l n="225">By a stanch witness to secure his prey .</l>
     <l n="226">The people cursed him , but in times of need</l>
     <l n="227">Trusted in one so certain to succeed :</l>
     <l n="228">By law 's dark by-ways he had stored his mind</l>
     <l n="229">With wicked knowledge , how to cheat mankind .</l>
     <l n="230">Few are the freeholds in our ancient town ; 230</l>
     <l n="231">A copy-right from heir to heir came down .</l>
     <l n="232">From whence some heat arose , when there was doubt</l>
     <l n="233">In point of heirship ; but the fire went out ,</l>
     <l n="234">Till our attorney had the art to raise</l>
     <l n="235">The dying spark , and blow it to a blaze .</l>
     <l n="236">For this he now began his friends to treat ;</l>
     <l n="237">His way to starve them was to make them eat ,</l>
     <l n="238">And drink oblivious draughts — to his applause</l>
     <l n="239">It must be said , he never starved a cause ;</l>
     <l n="240">He 'd roast and boil 'd upon his board — the boast 240</l>
     <l n="241">Of half his victims was his boil 'd and roast —</l>
     <l n="242">And these at every hour : he seldom took</l>
     <l n="243">Aside his client , till he 'd praised his cook ;</l>
     <l n="244">Nor to an office led him , there in pain</l>
     <l n="245">To give his story and go out again ,</l>
     <l n="246">But first the brandy and the chine were seen .</l>
     <l n="247">And then the business came by starts between .</l>
     <l n="248">“ Well , if ‘ tis so , the house to you belongs ;</l>
     <l n="249">But have you money to redress these wrongs ?</l>
     <l n="250">Nay , look not sad , my friend ; if you 're correct , 250</l>
     <l n="251">You 'll find the friendship that you 'd not expect . ”</l>
     <l n="252">If right the man , the house was Swallow 's own ;</l>
     <l n="253">If wrong , his kindness and good-will were shown .</l>
     <l n="254">“ Rogue ! ” “ Villain ! ” “ Scoundrel ! ” cried the losers all ;</l>
     <l n="255">He let them cry , for what would that recall ?</l>
     <l n="256">At length he left us , took a village seat ,</l>
     <l n="257">And like a vulture look 'd abroad for meat ;</l>
     <l n="258">The Borough-booty , give it all its praise ,</l>
     <l n="259">Had only served the appetite to raise ;</l>

     <l n="261">He might a noble feast at will command ;</l>
     <l n="262">Still he proceeded by his former rules ,</l>
     <l n="263">His bait their pleasures , when he fish 'd for fools ;—</l>
     <l n="264">Flagons and haunches on his board were placed ,</l>
     <l n="265">And subtle avarice look 'd like thoughtless waste .</l>
     <l n="266">Most of his friends , though youth from him had fled ,</l>
     <l n="267">Were young , were minors , of their sires in dread ;</l>
     <l n="268">Or those whom widow 'd mothers kept in bounds ,</l>
     <l n="269">And check 'd their generous rage for steeds and hounds ;</l>
     <l n="270">Or such as travell 'd ‘ cross the land to view 270</l>
     <l n="271">A Christian 's conflict with a boxing Jew .</l>
     <l n="272">Some too had run upon Newmarket heath</l>

     <l n="274">Others had tasted claret , till they now</l>
     <l n="275">To humbler port would turn , and knew not how .</l>
     <l n="276">All these for favours would to Swallow run ,</l>
     <l n="277">Who never sought their thanks for all he 'd done ;</l>
     <l n="278">He kindly took them by the hand , then bow 'd</l>
     <l n="279">Politely low , and thus his love avow 'd —</l>
     <l n="280">( For he 'd a way that many judged polite ; 280</l>

     <l n="298">A nurse attends him to lay straight his limbs ,</l>
     <l n="299">Present his gruel , and respect his whims .</l>
     <l n="300">Now , shall this dotard from our hero hold 300</l>
     <l n="301">His lands and lordships ? Shall he hide his gold ?</l>
     <l n="302">That which he cannot use , and dare not show ,</l>
     <l n="303">And will not give — why longer should he owe ?</l>
     <l n="304">Yet , ‘ twould be murder should we snap the locks ,</l>
     <l n="305">And take the thing he worships from the box ;</l>
     <l n="306">So let him dote and dream : but , till he die ,</l>
     <l n="307">Shall not our generous heir receive supply ?</l>
     <l n="308">For ever sitting on the river 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="309">And ever thirsty , shall he fear to drink ?</l>
     <l n="310">The means are simple : let him only wish , 310</l>
     <l n="311">Then say he 's willing , and I 'll fill his dish . ”</l>
     <l n="312">They all applauded , and not least the boy ,</l>
     <l n="313">Who now replied , “ It fill 'd his heart with joy</l>
     <l n="314">To find he needed not deliv'rance crave</l>
     <l n="315">Of death , or wish the justice in the grave ;</l>
     <l n="316">Who , while he spent , would every art retain ,</l>
     <l n="317">Of luring home the scatter 'd gold again ;</l>
     <l n="318">Just as a fountain gaily spirts and plays</l>
     <l n="319">With what returns in still and secret ways . ”</l>
     <l n="320">Short was the dream of bliss ; he quickly found , 320</l>
     <l n="321">His father 's acres all were Swallow 's ground .</l>
     <l n="322">Yet to those arts would other heroes lend</l>
     <l n="323">A willing ear , and Swallow was their friend ;</l>
     <l n="324">Ever successful , some began to think</l>
     <l n="325">That Satan help 'd him to his pen and ink ;</l>
     <l n="326">And shrewd suspicions ran about the place ,</l>
     <l n="327">“ There was a compact ” — I must leave the case .</l>
     <l n="328">But of the parties , had the fiend been one ,</l>
     <l n="329">The business could not have been speedier done .</l>
     <l n="330">Still , when a man has angled day and night , 330</l>
     <l n="331">The silliest gudgeons will refuse to bite :</l>
     <l n="332">So Swallow tried no more ; but if they came</l>
     <l n="333">To seek his friendship , that remain 'd the same .</l>
     <l n="334">Thus he retired in peace , and some would say ,</l>
     <l n="335">He balk 'd his partner , and had learn 'd to pray .</l>
     <l n="336">To this some zealots lent an ear , and sought</l>
     <l n="337">How Swallow felt , then said “ a change is wrought . ”</l>
     <l n="338">‘ Twas true there wanted all the signs of grace ,</l>
     <l n="339">But there were strong professions in their place ;</l>
     <l n="340">Then , too , the less that men from him expect , 340</l>
     <l n="341">The more the praise to the converting sect ;</l>
     <l n="342">He had not yet subscribed to all their creed ,</l>
     <l n="343">Nor own 'd a call ; but he confess 'd the need .</l>
     <l n="344">His acquiescent speech , his gracious look ,</l>
     <l n="345">That pure attention , when the brethren spoke ,</l>
     <l n="346">Was all contrition ,— he had felt the wound ,</l>
     <l n="347">And with confession would again be sound .</l>
     <l n="348">True , Swallow 's board had still the sumptuous treat ;</l>
     <l n="349">But could they blame ? the warmest zealots eat .</l>
     <l n="350">He drank — ‘ twas needful his poor nerves to brace ; 350</l>
     <l n="351">He swore — ‘ twas habit ; he was grieved — ‘ twas grace .</l>
     <l n="352">What could they do a new-born zeal to nurse ?</l>
     <l n="353">“ His wealth 's undoubted — let him hold our purse ;</l>
     <l n="354">He 'll add his bounty , and the house we 'll raise</l>
     <l n="355">Hard by the church , and gather all her strays ;</l>
     <l n="356">We 'll watch her sinners as they home retire ,</l>
     <l n="357">And pluck the brands from the devouring fire . ”</l>
     <l n="358">Alas ! such speech was but an empty boast ;</l>
     <l n="359">The good men reckon 'd , but without their host ;</l>
     <l n="360">Swallow , delighted , took the trusted store , 360</l>
     <l n="361">And own 'd the sum : they did not ask for more ,</l>
     <l n="362">Till more was needed ; when they call 'd for aid —</l>
     <l n="363">And had it ?— No , their agent was afraid ;</l>
     <l n="364">“ Could he but know to whom he should refund ,</l>
     <l n="365">He would most gladly — nay , he 'd go beyond ;</l>
     <l n="366">But , when such numbers claim 'd , when some were gone ,</l>
     <l n="367">And others going — he must hold it on ;</l>
     <l n="368">The Lord would help them , ” — Loud their anger grew , }</l>
     <l n="369">And while they threat'ning from his door withdrew , }</l>
     <l n="370">He bow 'd politely low , and bade them all adieu . 370 }</l>
     <l n="371">But lives the man by whom such deeds are done ?</l>
     <l n="372">Yes , many such — but Swallow 's race is run ;</l>
     <l n="373">His name is lost ;— for , though his sons have name ,</l>
     <l n="374">It is not his , they all escape the shame ;</l>
     <l n="375">Nor is there vestige now of all he had ,</l>
     <l n="376">His means are wasted , for his heir was mad .</l>
     <l n="377">Still we of Swallow as a monster speak ,</l>
     <l n="378">A hard , bad man , who prey 'd upon the weak .</l>

     <l n="7">We own that numbers join with care and skill</l>
     <l n="8">A temperate judgment , a devoted will :</l>
     <l n="9">Men who suppress their feelings , but who feel</l>
     <l n="10">The painful symptoms they delight to heal ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Patient in all their trials , they sustain</l>

     <l n="19">To the physicians of the soul , and these ,</l>
     <l n="20">Turn the distress 'd for safety , hope , and ease . 20</l>
     <l n="21">But as physicians of that nobler kind</l>
     <l n="22">Have their warm zealots , and their sectaries blind ;</l>
     <l n="23">So among these for knowledge most renown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="24">Are dreamers strange , and stubborn bigots found .</l>
     <l n="25">Some , too , admitted to this honour 'd name ,</l>
     <l n="26">Have , without learning , found a way to fame ;</l>
     <l n="27">And some by learning :— young physicians write ,</l>
     <l n="28">To set their merit in the fairest light ;</l>
     <l n="29">With them a treatise is a bait that draws</l>
     <l n="30">Approving voices ; ‘ tis to gain applause , 30</l>
     <l n="31">And to exalt them in the public view ,</l>
     <l n="32">More than a life of worthy toil could do .</l>

     <l n="43">As rustic damsels from their woods are won ,</l>
     <l n="44">And live in splendour till their race be run ;</l>
     <l n="45">It weighs not much on what their powers be shown ,</l>
     <l n="46">When all his purpose is to make them known .</l>
     <l n="47">To show the world what long experience gains ,</l>
     <l n="48">Requires not courage , though it calls for pains ;</l>
     <l n="49">But , at life 's outset to inform mankind ,</l>
     <l n="50">Is a bold effort of a valiant mind . 50</l>
     <l n="51">The great good man , for noblest cause , displays</l>
     <l n="52">What many labours taught , and many days ;</l>
     <l n="53">These sound instruction from experience give ,</l>
     <l n="54">The others show us how they mean to live ;</l>
     <l n="55">That they have genius , and they hope mankind</l>
     <l n="56">Will to its efforts be no longer blind .</l>
     <l n="57">There are , beside , whom powerful friends advance ,</l>
     <l n="58">Whom fashion favours , person , patrons , chance ;</l>
     <l n="59">And merit sighs to see a fortune made</l>
     <l n="60">By daring rashness or by dull parade . 60</l>
     <l n="61">But these are trifling evils ; there is one</l>
     <l n="62">Which walks uncheck 'd , and triumphs in the sun :</l>
     <l n="63">There was a time , when we beheld the quack ,</l>
     <l n="64">On public stage , the licensed trade attack ;</l>
     <l n="65">He made his labour 'd speech with poor parade ;</l>
     <l n="66">And then a laughing zany lent him aid .</l>
     <l n="67">Smiling we pass 'd him , but we felt the while</l>
     <l n="68">Pity so much , that soon we ceased to smile ;</l>
     <l n="69">Assured that fluent speech and flow'ry vest</l>
     <l n="70">Disguised the troubles of a man distress 'd . 70</l>
     <l n="71">But now our quacks are gamesters , and they play</l>
     <l n="72">With craft and skill to ruin and betray ;</l>
     <l n="73">With monstrous promise they delude the mind ,</l>
     <l n="74">And thrive on all that tortures human-kind .</l>
     <l n="75">Void of all honour , avaricious , rash ,</l>
     <l n="76">The daring tribe compound their boasted trash —</l>
     <l n="77">Tincture or syrup , lotion , drop or pill ;</l>
     <l n="78">All tempt the sick to trust the lying bill ;</l>
     <l n="79">And twenty names of cobblers turn 'd to squires ,</l>
     <l n="80">Aid the bold language of these blushless liars . 80</l>
     <l n="81">There are among them those who cannot read ,</l>
     <l n="82">And yet they 'll buy a patent , and succeed ;</l>
     <l n="83">Will dare to promise dying sufferers aid ,—</l>
     <l n="84">For who , when dead , can threaten or upbraid ?</l>
     <l n="85">With cruel avarice still they recommend</l>
     <l n="86">More draughts , more syrup , to the journey 's end :</l>
     <l n="87">“ I feel it not ; ” — “ Then take it every hour . ” —</l>
     <l n="88">“ It makes me worse ; ” — “ Why , then it shows its power . ” —</l>
     <l n="89">“ I fear to die ; ” — “ Let not your spirits sink ,</l>
     <l n="90">You 're always safe , while you believe and drink . ” 90</l>
     <l n="91">How strange to add , in this nefarious trade ,</l>
     <l n="92">That men of parts are dupes by dunces made :</l>
     <l n="93">That creatures nature meant should clean our streets</l>
     <l n="94">Have purchased lands and mansions , parks and seats ;</l>
     <l n="95">Wretches with conscience so obtuse , they leave</l>
     <l n="96">Their untaught sons their parents to deceive ;</l>
     <l n="97">And , when they 're laid upon their dying-bed ,</l>
     <l n="98">No thought of murder comes into their head ,</l>
     <l n="99">Nor one revengeful ghost to them appears ,</l>
     <l n="100">To fill the soul with penitential fears . 100</l>
     <l n="101">Yet not the whole of this imposing train</l>
     <l n="102">Their gardens , seats , and carriages obtain ;</l>
     <l n="103">Chiefly , indeed , they to the robbers fall ,</l>
     <l n="104">Who are most fitted to disgrace them all .</l>
     <l n="105">But there is hazard — patents must be bought ,</l>
     <l n="106">Venders and puffers for the poison sought ;</l>
     <l n="107">And then in many a paper through the year</l>
     <l n="108">Must cures and cases , oaths and proofs appear ;</l>
     <l n="109">Men snatch 'd from graves , as they were dropping in ,</l>
     <l n="110">Their lungs cough 'd up , their bones pierced through their skin ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Their liver all one scirrhus , and the frame</l>
     <l n="112">Poison 'd with evils which they dare not name ;</l>
     <l n="113">Men who spent all upon physicians ’ fees , }</l>
     <l n="114">Who never slept , nor had a moment 's ease , }</l>
     <l n="115">Are now as roaches sound , and all as brisk as bees . }</l>
     <l n="116">If the sick gudgeons to the bait attend ,</l>
     <l n="117">And come in shoals , the angler gains his end ;</l>
     <l n="118">But , should the advertising cash be spent ,</l>
     <l n="119">Ere yet the town has due attention lent ,</l>
     <l n="120">Then bursts the bubble , and the hungry cheat 120</l>
     <l n="121">Pines for the bread he ill deserves to eat :</l>
     <l n="122">It is a lottery , and he shares perhaps</l>
     <l n="123">The rich man 's feast , or begs the pauper 's scraps .</l>
     <l n="124">From powerful causes spring th ’ empiric 's gains ,</l>
     <l n="125">Man 's love of life , his weakness , and his pains ;</l>
     <l n="126">These first induce him the vile trash to try ,</l>
     <l n="127">Then lend his name , that other men may buy .</l>
     <l n="128">This love of life , which in our nature rules ,</l>
     <l n="129">To vile imposture makes us dupes and tools ;</l>
     <l n="130">Then pain compels th ’ impatient soul to seize 130</l>
     <l n="131">On promised hopes of instantaneous ease ;</l>
     <l n="132">And weakness too with every wish complies ,</l>
     <l n="133">Worn out and won by importunities .</l>
     <l n="134">Troubled with something in your bile or blood ,</l>
     <l n="135">You think your doctor does you little good ;</l>
     <l n="136">And , grown impatient , you require in haste</l>
     <l n="137">The nervous cordial , nor dislike the taste ;</l>
     <l n="138">It comforts , heals , and strengthens ; nay , you think</l>
     <l n="139">It makes you better every time you drink ;</l>
     <l n="140">“ Then lend your name ” — you 're loth , but yet confess 140</l>
     <l n="141">Its powers are great , and so you acquiesce .</l>
     <l n="142">Yet , think a moment , ere your name you lend ,</l>
     <l n="143">With whose ‘ tis placed , and what you recommend ;</l>
     <l n="144">Who tipples brandy will some comfort feel ,</l>
     <l n="145">But will he to the med'cine set his seal ?</l>
     <l n="146">Wait , and you 'll find the cordial you admire</l>
     <l n="147">Has added fuel to your fever 's fire .</l>
     <l n="148">Say , should a robber chance your purse to spare ,</l>
     <l n="149">Would you the honour of the man declare ?</l>
     <l n="150">Would you assist his purpose ? swell his crime ? 150</l>
     <l n="151">Besides , he might not spare a second time .</l>
     <l n="152">Compassion sometimes sets the fatal sign ,</l>
     <l n="153">The man was poor , and humbly begg 'd a line ;</l>
     <l n="154">Else how should noble names and titles back</l>
     <l n="155">The spreading praise of some advent'rous quack ?</l>
     <l n="156">But he the moment watches , and entreats</l>
     <l n="157">Your honour 's name — your honour joins the cheats ;</l>
     <l n="158">You judged the med'cine harmless , and you lent</l>
     <l n="159">What help you could , and with the best intent ;</l>
     <l n="160">But can it please you , thus to league with all 160</l>
     <l n="161">Whom he can beg or bribe to swell the scrawl ?</l>
     <l n="162">Would you these wrappers with your name adorn ,</l>
     <l n="163">Which hold the poison for the yet unborn ?</l>
     <l n="164">No class escapes them — from the poor man 's pay</l>
     <l n="165">The nostrum takes no trifling part away ;</l>
     <l n="166">See ! those square patent bottles from the shop ,</l>
     <l n="167">Now decoration to the cupboard 's top ;</l>
     <l n="168">And there a favourite hoard you 'll find within ,</l>
     <l n="169">Companions meet ! the julep and the gin .</l>
     <l n="170">Time too with cash is wasted ; ‘ tis the fate 170</l>
     <l n="171">Of real helpers to be call 'd too late ;</l>
     <l n="172">This find the sick , when ( time and patience gone )</l>
     <l n="173">Death with a tenfold terror hurries on .</l>
     <l n="174">Suppose the case surpasses human skill ,</l>
     <l n="175">There comes a quack to flatter weakness still ;</l>
     <l n="176">What greater evil can a flatterer do ,</l>
     <l n="177">Than from himself to take the sufferer 's view ?</l>
     <l n="178">To turn from sacred thoughts his reasoning powers ,</l>
     <l n="179">And rob a sinner of his dying hours ?</l>
     <l n="180">Yet this they , dare and craving to the last , 180</l>
     <l n="181">In hope 's strong bondage hold their victim fast :</l>
     <l n="182">For soul or body no concern have they , }</l>
     <l n="183">All their inquiry , “ Can the patient pay ? }</l>
     <l n="184">And will he swallow draughts until his dying day ? ” }</l>
     <l n="185">Observe what ills to nervous females flow ,</l>
     <l n="186">When the heart flutters , and the pulse is low ;</l>
     <l n="187">If once induced these cordial sips to try ,</l>
     <l n="188">All feel the ease , and few the danger fly ;</l>
     <l n="189">For , while obtain 'd , of drams they 've all the force ,</l>
     <l n="190">And when denied , then drams are the resource . 190</l>
     <l n="191">Nor these the only evils — there are those</l>
     <l n="192">Who for the troubled mind prepare repose ;</l>
     <l n="193">They write : the young are tenderly address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="194">Much danger hinted , much concern express 'd ;</l>
     <l n="195">They dwell on freedoms lads are prone to take ,</l>
     <l n="196">Which makes the doctor tremble for their sake ;</l>
     <l n="197">Still , if the youthful patient will but trust</l>
     <l n="198">In one so kind , so pitiful , and just ;</l>
     <l n="199">If he will take the tonic all the time ,</l>
     <l n="200">And hold but moderate intercourse with crime : 200</l>
     <l n="201">The sage will gravely give his honest word ,</l>
     <l n="202">That strength and spirits shall be both restored ;</l>
     <l n="203">In plainer English — if you mean to sin ,</l>
     <l n="204">Fly to the drops , and instantly begin .</l>
     <l n="205">Who would not lend a sympathizing sigh ,</l>
     <l n="206">To hear yon infant 's pity-moving cry ?</l>
     <l n="207">That feeble sob , unlike the new-born note ,</l>
     <l n="208">Which came with vigour from the op'ning throat ;</l>
     <l n="209">When air and light first rush 'd on lungs and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="210">And there was life and spirit in the cries ; 210</l>
     <l n="211">Now an abortive , faint attempt to weep</l>
     <l n="212">Is all we hear ; sensation is asleep .</l>
     <l n="213">The boy was healthy , and at first express 'd</l>
     <l n="214">His feelings loudly , when he fail 'd to rest ;</l>
     <l n="215">When cramm 'd with food , and tighten 'd every limb ,</l>
     <l n="216">To cry aloud , was what pertain 'd to him ;</l>
     <l n="217">Then the good nurse , ( who , had she borne a brain ,</l>
     <l n="218">Had sought the cause that made her babe complain ,)</l>
     <l n="219">Has all her efforts , loving soul ! applied ,</l>
     <l n="220">To set the cry , and not the cause , aside ; 220</l>
     <l n="221">She gave her powerful sweet without remorse ,</l>
     <l n="222">The sleeping cordial — she had tried its force ,</l>
     <l n="223">Repeating oft ; the infant , freed from pain ,</l>
     <l n="224">Rejected food , but took the dose again ,</l>
     <l n="225">Sinking to sleep ; while she her joy express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="226">That her dear charge could sweetly take his rest :</l>
     <l n="227">Soon may she spare her cordial ; not a doubt</l>
     <l n="228">Remains but quickly he will rest without .</l>
     <l n="229">This moves our grief and pity , and we sigh</l>
     <l n="230">To think what numbers from these causes die ; 230</l>
     <l n="231">But what contempt and anger should we show ,</l>
     <l n="232">Did we the lives of these impostors know !</l>
     <l n="233">Ere for the world 's I left the cares of school ,</l>
     <l n="234">One I remember who assumed the fool :</l>
     <l n="235">A part well suited — when the idler boys</l>
     <l n="236">Would shout around him , and he loved the noise ;</l>
     <l n="237">They call 'd him Neddy ;— Neddy had the art</l>
     <l n="238">To play with skill his ignominious part ;</l>
     <l n="239">When he his trifles would for sale display ,</l>
     <l n="240">And act the mimic for a schoolboy 's pay . 240</l>
     <l n="241">For many years he plied his humble trade ,</l>
     <l n="242">And used his tricks and talents to persuade ;</l>
     <l n="243">The fellow barely read , but chanced to look</l>
     <l n="244">Among the fragments of a tatter 'd book ,</l>
     <l n="245">Where , after many efforts made to spell</l>
     <l n="246">One puzzling word , he found it oxymel :</l>
     <l n="247">A potent thing , ‘ twas said , to cure the ills</l>
     <l n="248">Of ailing lungs — the oxymel of squills .</l>
     <l n="249">Squills he procured , but found the bitter strong ,</l>
     <l n="250">And most unpleasant ; none would take it long ; 250</l>
     <l n="251">But the pure acid and the sweet would make</l>
     <l n="252">A med'cine numbers would for pleasure take .</l>
     <l n="253">There was a fellow near , an artful knave ,</l>
     <l n="254">Who knew the plan , and much assistance gave ;</l>
     <l n="255">He wrote the puffs , and every talent plied</l>
     <l n="256">To make it sell : it sold , and then he died .</l>
     <l n="257">Now all the profit fell to Ned 's control ,</l>
     <l n="258">And Pride and Avarice quarrell 'd for his soul ;</l>
     <l n="259">When mighty profits by the trash were made ,</l>
     <l n="260">Pride built a palace , Avarice groan 'd and paid ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">Pride placed the signs of grandeur all about ,</l>
     <l n="262">And Avarice barr 'd his friends and children out .</l>
     <l n="263">Now see him doctor ! yes , the idle fool ,</l>
     <l n="264">The butt , the robber of the lads at school ;</l>
     <l n="265">Who then knew nothing , nothing since acquired ,</l>
     <l n="266">Became a doctor , honour 'd and admired ;</l>
     <l n="267">His dress , his frown , his dignity were such ,</l>
     <l n="268">Some who had known him thought his knowledge much ;</l>
     <l n="269">Nay , men of skill , of apprehension quick ,</l>
     <l n="270">Spite of their knowledge , trusted him when sick . 270</l>
     <l n="271">Though he could never reason , write , nor spell , }</l>
     <l n="272">They yet had hope his trash would make them well ; }</l>
     <l n="273">And while they scorn 'd his parts , they took his oxymel . }</l>
     <l n="274">Oh ! when his nerves had once received a shock ,</l>
     <l n="275">Sir Isaac Newton might have gone to Rock [ 52 ]:</l>
     <l n="276">Hence impositions of the grossest kind ;</l>
     <l n="277">Hence thought is feeble , understanding blind ;</l>
     <l n="278">Hence sums enormous by those cheats are made ,</l>
     <l n="279">And deaths unnumber 'd by their dreadful trade .</l>
     <l n="280">Alas ! in vain is my contempt express 'd ; 280</l>
     <l n="281">To stronger passions are their words address 'd :</l>
     <l n="282">To pain , to fear , to terror their appeal ,</l>
     <l n="283">To those who , weakly reasoning , strongly feel .</l>
     <l n="284">What then our hopes ?— perhaps there may by law</l>
     <l n="285">Be method found , these pests to curb and awe ;</l>
     <l n="286">Yet in this land of freedom , law is slack</l>
     <l n="287">With any being to commence attack ;</l>
     <l n="288">Then let us trust to science — there are those }</l>
     <l n="289">Who can their falsehoods and their frauds disclose , }</l>
     <l n="290">All their vile trash detect , and their low tricks expose . 290 }</l>
     <l n="291">Perhaps their numbers may in time confound</l>
     <l n="292">Their arts — as scorpions give themselves the wound :</l>
     <l n="293">For , when these curers dwell in every place ,</l>
     <l n="294">While of the cured we not a man can trace ,</l>
     <l n="295">Strong truth may then the public mind persuade ,</l>
     <l n="296">And spoil the fruits of this nefarious trade .</l>

     <l n="1">Of manufactures , trade , inventions rare ,</l>
     <l n="2">Steam-towers and looms , you 'd know our Borough 's share —</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis small : we boast not these rich subjects here ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who hazard thrice ten thousand pounds a year ,</l>
     <l n="5">We 've no huge buildings , where incessant noise</l>
     <l n="6">Is made by springs and spindles , girls and boys ;</l>
     <l n="7">Where , ‘ mid such thundering sounds , the maiden 's song</l>
     <l n="8">Is “ Harmony in Uproar "[ 53 ] all day long .</l>
     <l n="9">Still , common minds with us , in common trade ,</l>
     <l n="10">Have gain 'd more wealth than ever student made ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">And yet a merchant , when he gives his son</l>
     <l n="12">His college-learning , thinks his duty done ;</l>
     <l n="13">A way to wealth he leaves his boy to find ,</l>
     <l n="14">Just when he 's made for the discovery blind .</l>
     <l n="15">Jones and his wife perceived their elder boy</l>
     <l n="16">Took to his learning , and it gave them joy ;</l>
     <l n="17">This they encouraged , and were bless 'd to see</l>
     <l n="18">Their son a Fellow with a high degree ;</l>
     <l n="19">A living fell , he married , and his sire</l>
     <l n="20">Declared ‘ twas all a father could require ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Children then bless 'd them , and when letters came ,</l>
     <l n="22">The parents proudly told each grandchild 's name .</l>
     <l n="23">Meantime the sons at home in trade were placed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Money their object — just the father 's taste ;</l>
     <l n="25">Saving he lived and long , and when he died ,</l>
     <l n="26">He gave them all his fortune to divide .</l>
     <l n="27">“ Martin , ” said he , “ at vast expense was taught ;</l>
     <l n="28">He gain 'd his wish , and has the ease he sought . ”</l>
     <l n="29">Thus the good priest ( the Christian-scholar ! ) finds</l>
     <l n="30">What estimate is made by vulgar minds ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">He sees his brothers , who had every gift</l>
     <l n="32">Of thriving , now assisted in their thrift ;</l>
     <l n="33">While he whom learning , habits , all prevent ,</l>
     <l n="34">Is largely mulct for each impediment .</l>
     <l n="35">Yet , let us own that trade has much of chance :</l>
     <l n="36">Not all the careful by their care advance ;</l>
     <l n="37">With the same parts and prospects , one a seat</l>
     <l n="38">Builds for himself ; one finds it in the Fleet .</l>
     <l n="39">Then , to the wealthy you will see denied</l>
     <l n="40">Comforts and joys that with the poor abide : 40</l>
     <l n="41">There are who labour through the year , and yet</l>
     <l n="42">No more have gain 'd than — not to be in debt ;</l>
     <l n="43">Who still maintain the same laborious course ,</l>
     <l n="44">Yet pleasure hails them from some favourite source ;</l>
     <l n="45">And health , amusements , children , wife or friend ,</l>
     <l n="46">With life 's dull views their consolations blend .</l>
     <l n="47">Nor these alone possess the lenient power</l>
     <l n="48">Of soothing life in the desponding hour ;</l>
     <l n="49">Some favourite studies , some delightful care ,</l>
     <l n="50">The mind with trouble and distresses share ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">And by a coin , a flower , a verse , a boat ,</l>
     <l n="52">The stagnant spirits have been set afloat ;</l>
     <l n="53">They pleased at first , and then the habit grew ,</l>
     <l n="54">Till the fond heart no higher pleasure knew ;</l>
     <l n="55">Till , from all cares and other comforts freed ,</l>
     <l n="56">Th ’ important nothing took in life the lead .</l>
     <l n="57">With all his phlegm , it broke a Dutchman 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="58">At a vast price with one loved root to part ;</l>
     <l n="59">And toys like these fill many a British mind ,</l>
     <l n="60">Although their hearts are found of firmer kind . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Oft have I smiled the happy pride to see</l>
     <l n="62">Of humble tradesmen , in their evening glee ;</l>
     <l n="63">When , of some pleasing , fancied good possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">Each grew alert , was busy , and was bless 'd ;</l>
     <l n="65">Whether the call-bird yield the hour 's delight ,</l>
     <l n="66">Or , magnified in microscope , the mite ;</l>
     <l n="67">Or whether tumblers , croppers , carriers seize</l>
     <l n="68">The gentle mind , they rule it and they please .</l>
     <l n="69">There is my friend the Weaver ; strong desires</l>
     <l n="70">Reign in his breast ; ‘ tis beauty he admires : 70</l>
     <l n="71">See ! to the shady grove he wings his way ,</l>
     <l n="72">And feels in hope the raptures of the day —</l>
     <l n="73">Eager he looks ; and soon , to glad his eyes , }</l>
     <l n="74">From the sweet bower , by nature form 'd , arise }</l>
     <l n="75">Bright troops of virgin moths and fresh-born butterflies ; }</l>
     <l n="76">Who broke that morning from their half-year 's sleep ,</l>
     <l n="77">To fly o'er flow'rs where they were wont to creep .</l>
     <l n="78">Above the sovereign oak a sovereign skims ,</l>
     <l n="79">The purple Emp'ror , strong in wing and limbs :</l>
     <l n="80">There fair Camilla takes her flight serene , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Adonis blue , and Paphia , silver-queen ;</l>
     <l n="82">With every filmy fly from mead or bower ,</l>
     <l n="83">And hungry Sphinx , who threads the honey 'd flower ;</l>
     <l n="84">She o'er the Larkspur 's bed , where sweets abound ,</l>
     <l n="85">Views ev'ry bell , and hums th ’ approving sound ;</l>
     <l n="86">Poised on her busy plumes , with feeling nice</l>
     <l n="87">She draws from every flower , nor tries a floret twice .</l>
     <l n="88">He fears no bailiff 's wrath , no baron 's blame ,</l>
     <l n="89">His is untax 'd and undisputed game ;</l>
     <l n="90">Nor less the place of curious plant he knows<span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>; 90</l>
     <l n="91">He both his Flora and his Fauna shows ;</l>
     <l n="92">For him is blooming in its rich array</l>
     <l n="93">The glorious flower which bore the palm away ;</l>
     <l n="94">In vain a rival tried his utmost art ,</l>
     <l n="95">His was the prize , and joy o'erflow ' d his heart .</l>
     <l n="96">“ This , this is beauty ! cast , I pray , your eyes</l>
     <l n="97">On this my glory ! see the grace ! the size !</l>
     <l n="98">Was ever stem so tall , so stout , so strong ,</l>
     <l n="99">Exact in breadth , in just proportion , long !</l>
     <l n="100">These brilliant hues are all distinct and clean , 100</l>
     <l n="101">No kindred tint , no blending streaks between ;</l>
     <l n="102">This is no shaded , run-off<span type="note_anchor">[ 55 ]</span>, pin-eyed<span type="note_anchor">[ 56 ]</span>thing ,</l>
     <l n="103">A king of flowers , a flower for England 's king :</l>
     <l n="104">I own my pride , and thank the favouring star ,</l>
     <l n="105">Which shed such beauty on my fair Bizarre<span type="note_anchor">[ 57 ]</span>. ”</l>
     <l n="106">Thus may the poor the cheap indulgence seize ,</l>
     <l n="107">While the most wealthy pine and pray for ease ;</l>
     <l n="108">Content not always waits upon success ,</l>
     <l n="109">And more may he enjoy who profits less .</l>
     <l n="110">Walter and William took ( their father dead ) 110</l>
     <l n="111">Jointly the trade to which they both were bred ;</l>
     <l n="112">When fix 'd , they married , and they quickly found</l>
     <l n="113">With due success their honest labours crown 'd :</l>
     <l n="114">Few were their losses , but , although a few ,</l>
     <l n="115">Walter was vex 'd , and somewhat peevish grew :</l>
     <l n="116">“ You put your trust in every pleading fool , ”</l>
     <l n="117">Said he to William , and grew strange and cool .</l>
     <l n="118">“ Brother , forbear , ” he answer 'd ; “ take your due ,</l>
     <l n="119">Nor let my lack of caution injure you . ”</l>
     <l n="120">Half friends they parted ,— better so to close , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Than longer wait to part entirely foes .</l>
     <l n="122">Walter had knowledge , prudence , jealous care ;</l>
     <l n="123">He let no idle views his bosom share ;</l>
     <l n="124">He never thought nor felt for other men —</l>
     <l n="125">“ Let one mind one , and all are minded then . ”</l>
     <l n="126">Friends he respected , and believed them just ;</l>
     <l n="127">But they were men , and he would no man trust ;</l>
     <l n="128">He tried and watch 'd his people day and night ,—</l>
     <l n="129">The good it harm 'd not ; for the bad ‘ twas right :</l>
     <l n="130">He could their humours bear , nay disrespect , 130</l>
     <l n="131">But he could yield no pardon to neglect ;</l>
     <l n="132">That all about him were of him afraid ,</l>
     <l n="133">“ Was right , ” he said — “ so should we be obey 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="134">These merchant-maxims , much good-fortune too , }</l>
     <l n="135">And ever keeping one grand point in view , }</l>
     <l n="136">To vast amount his once small portion drew . }</l>
     <l n="137">William was kind and easy ; he complied</l>
     <l n="138">With all requests , or grieved when he denied ;</l>
     <l n="139">To please his wife he made a costly trip ,</l>
     <l n="140">To please his child he let a bargain slip ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Prone to compassion , mild with the distress 'd , }</l>
     <l n="142">He bore with all who poverty profess 'd , }</l>
     <l n="143">And some would he assist , nor one would he arrest . }</l>
     <l n="144">He had some loss at sea , bad debts at land , }</l>
     <l n="145">His clerk absconded with some bills in hand , }</l>
     <l n="146">And plans so often fail 'd that he no longer plann 'd . }</l>
     <l n="147">To a small house ( his brother 's ) he withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="148">At easy rent — the man was not a Jew ;</l>
     <l n="149">And there his losses and his cares he bore ,</l>
     <l n="150">Nor found that want of wealth could make him poor . 150</l>
     <l n="151">No , he in fact was rich ; nor could he move ,</l>
     <l n="152">But he was follow 'd by the looks of love ;</l>
     <l n="153">All he had suffer 'd , every former grief ,</l>
     <l n="154">Made those around more studious in relief ;</l>
     <l n="155">He saw a cheerful smile in every face ,</l>
     <l n="156">And lost all thoughts of error and disgrace .</l>
     <l n="157">Pleasant it was to see them in their walk</l>
     <l n="158">Round their small garden , and to hear them talk ;</l>
     <l n="159">Free are their children , but their love refrains</l>
     <l n="160">From all offence — none murmurs , none complains ; 160</l>
     <l n="161">Whether a book amused them , speech or play ,</l>
     <l n="162">Their looks were lively , and their hearts were gay ;</l>
     <l n="163">There no forced efforts for delight were made ,</l>
     <l n="164">Joy came with prudence , and without parade ;</l>
     <l n="165">Their common comforts they had all in view ,</l>
     <l n="166">Light were their troubles , and their wishes few ;</l>
     <l n="167">Thrift made them easy for the coming day ;</l>
     <l n="168">Religion took the dread of death away ;</l>
     <l n="169">A cheerful spirit still insured content ,</l>
     <l n="170">And love smiled round them wheresoe'er they went . 170</l>
     <l n="171">Walter , meantime , with all his wealth 's increase ,</l>
     <l n="172">Gain 'd many points , but could not purchase peace ;</l>
     <l n="173">When he withdrew from business for an hour ,</l>
     <l n="174">Some fled his presence , all confess 'd his power ;</l>
     <l n="175">He sought affection , but received instead</l>
     <l n="176">Fear undisguised , and love-repelling dread ;</l>
     <l n="177">He look 'd around him — “ Harriet , dost thou love ? ” —</l>
     <l n="178">“ I do my duty , ” said the timid dove ;—</l>
     <l n="179">“ Good Heav'n , your duty ! prithee , tell me now —</l>
     <l n="180">To love and honour — was not that your vow ? 180</l>
     <l n="181">Come , my good Harriet , I would gladly seek</l>
     <l n="182">Your inmost thought — Why can n't the woman speak ?</l>
     <l n="183">Have you not all things ? ” — “ Sir , do I complain ? ” —</l>
     <l n="184">“ No , that 's my part , which I perform in vain ;</l>
     <l n="185">I want a simple answer , and direct —</l>
     <l n="186">But you evade ; yes ! ‘ tis as I suspect .</l>
     <l n="187">Come then , my children ! Watt ! upon your knees</l>
     <l n="188">Vow that you love me . ” — “ Yes , sir , if you please . ” —</l>
     <l n="189">“ Again ! by Heav'n , it mads me ; I require</l>
     <l n="190">Love , and they 'll do whatever I desire . 190</l>
     <l n="191">Thus too my people shun me ; I would spend</l>
     <l n="192">A thousand pounds to get a single friend ;</l>
     <l n="193">I would be happy — I have means to pay</l>
     <l n="194">For love and friendship , and you run away ;</l>
     <l n="195">Ungrateful creatures ! why , you seem to dread</l>
     <l n="196">My very looks ; I know you wish me dead .</l>
     <l n="197">Come hither , Nancy ! you must hold me dear ;</l>
     <l n="198">Hither , I say ; why ! what have you to fear ?</l>
     <l n="199">You see I 'm gentle — Come , you trifler , come ;</l>
     <l n="200">My God ! she trembles ! Idiot , leave the room ! 200</l>
     <l n="201">Madam ! your children hate me ; I suppose</l>
     <l n="202">They know their cue ; you make them all my foes ;</l>
     <l n="203">I 've not a friend in all the world — not one :</l>
     <l n="204">I 'd be a bankrupt sooner ; nay , ‘ tis done ;</l>
     <l n="205">In every better hope of life I fail ;</l>
     <l n="206">You 're all tormentors , and my house a jail ;</l>
     <l n="207">Out of my sight ! I 'll sit and make my will —</l>
     <l n="208">What , glad to go ? stay , devils , and be still ;</l>
     <l n="209">‘ Tis to your uncle 's cot you wish to run ,</l>
     <l n="210">To learn to live at ease and be undone ; 210</l>
     <l n="211">Him you can love , who lost his whole estate ,</l>
     <l n="212">And I , who gain you fortunes , have your hate ;</l>
     <l n="213">‘ Tis in my absence you yourselves enjoy :</l>
     <l n="214">Tom ! are you glad to lose me ? tell me , boy :</l>
     <l n="215">‘ Yes ! ’ does he answer ? ” — “ ‘ Yes ! ’ upon my soul ; ”</l>
     <l n="216">“ No awe , no fear , no duty , no control !</l>
     <l n="217">Away ! away ! ten thousand devils seize</l>
     <l n="218">All I possess , and plunder where they please !</l>
     <l n="219">What 's wealth to me ?— yes , yes ! it gives me sway ,</l>
     <l n="220">And you shall feel it — Go ! begone , I say . ” 220</l>

   <p>This , it must be acknowledged , is contrary to the opinion of Thomson , and I believe of some other poets , who , in describing the varying hues of our most beautiful flowers , have considered them as lost and blended with each other ; whereas their beauty , in the eye of a florist ( and I conceive in that of the uninitiated also ) , depends upon the distinctness of their colours : the stronger the bounding line , and the less they break into the neighbouring tint , so much the richer and more valuable is the flower esteemed .</p>

     <l n="1">Of our amusements ask you ?— We amuse }</l>
     <l n="2">Ourselves and friends with sea-side walks and views , }</l>
     <l n="3">Or take a morning ride , a novel , or the news ; }</l>
     <l n="4">Or , seeking nothing , glide about the street ,</l>
     <l n="5">And , so engaged , with various parties meet ;</l>
     <l n="6">Awhile we stop , discourse of wind and tide ,</l>
     <l n="7">Bathing and books , the raffle , and the ride :</l>
     <l n="8">Thus , with the aid which shops and sailing give ,</l>
     <l n="9">Life passes on ; ‘ tis labour , but we live .</l>
     <l n="10">When evening comes , our invalids awake , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Nerves cease to tremble , heads forbear to ache ;</l>
     <l n="12">Then cheerful meals the sunken spirits raise ,</l>
     <l n="13">Cards or the dance , wine , visiting , or plays .</l>
     <l n="14">Soon as the season comes , and crowds arrive ,</l>
     <l n="15">To their superior rooms the wealthy drive ;</l>
     <l n="16">Others look round for lodging snug and small ,</l>
     <l n="17">Such is their taste — they 've hatred to a hall ;</l>
     <l n="18">Hence one his fav'rite habitation gets ,</l>
     <l n="19">The brick-floor 'd parlour which the butcher lets ;</l>
     <l n="20">Where , through his single light , he may regard 20</l>
     <l n="21">The various business of a common yard ,</l>
     <l n="22">Bounded by backs of buildings form 'd of clay ,</l>

     <l n="24">The needy-vain , themselves awhile to shun ,</l>
     <l n="25">For dissipation to these dog-holes run ;</l>
     <l n="26">Where each ( assuming petty pomp ) appears ,</l>
     <l n="27">And quite forgets the shopboard and the shears .</l>
     <l n="28">For them are cheap amusements : they may slip</l>
     <l n="29">Beyond the town and take a private dip ;</l>
     <l n="30">When they may urge that to be safe they mean : 30</l>
     <l n="31">They 've heard there 's danger in a light machine ;</l>
     <l n="32">They too can gratis move the quays about ,</l>

     <l n="40">May see its varying views in every hour , 40 }</l>
     <l n="41">All softness now , then rising with all power , }</l>
     <l n="42">As sleeping to invite , or threat'ning to devour : }</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Tis this which gives us all our choicest views ;</l>
     <l n="44">Its waters heal us , and its shores amuse .</l>
     <l n="45">See those fair nymphs upon that rising strand ,</l>
     <l n="46">Yon long salt lake has parted from the land ;</l>
     <l n="47">Well pleased to press that path , so clean , so pure ,</l>
     <l n="48">To seem in danger , yet to feel secure ;</l>
     <l n="49">Trifling with terror , while they strive to shun</l>
     <l n="50">The curling billows ; laughing as they run ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">They know the neck that joins the shore and sea ,</l>
     <l n="52">Or , ah ! how changed that fearless laugh would be .</l>
     <l n="53">Observe how various parties take their way ,</l>
     <l n="54">By sea-side walks , or make the sand-hills gay ;</l>
     <l n="55">There group 'd are laughing maids and sighing swains ,</l>
     <l n="56">And some apart who feel unpitied pains :</l>
     <l n="57">Pains from diseases , pains which those who feel</l>
     <l n="58">To the physician , not the fair , reveal ;</l>
     <l n="59">For nymphs ( propitious to the lover 's sigh )</l>
     <l n="60">Leave these poor patients to complain and die . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Lo ! where on that huge anchor sadly leans</l>
     <l n="62">That sick tall figure , lost in other scenes ;</l>
     <l n="63">He late from India 's clime impatient sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">There , as his fortune grew , his spirits fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="65">For each delight , in search of wealth he went ,</l>
     <l n="66">For ease alone , the wealth acquired is spent —</l>
     <l n="67">And spent in vain ; enrich 'd , aggriev 'd , he sees</l>
     <l n="68">The envied poor possess 'd of joy and ease ;</l>
     <l n="69">And now he flies from place to place , to gain</l>
     <l n="70">Strength for enjoyment , and still flies in vain . 70</l>
     <l n="71">Mark , with what sadness , of that pleasant crew ,</l>
     <l n="72">Boist'rous in mirth , he takes a transient view ,</l>
     <l n="73">And , fixing then his eye upon the sea ,</l>
     <l n="74">Thinks what has been and what must shortly be :</l>
     <l n="75">Is it not strange that man should health destroy ,</l>
     <l n="76">For joys that come when he is dead to joy ?</l>
     <l n="77">Now is it pleasant in the summer-eve ,</l>
     <l n="78">When a broad shore retiring waters leave ,</l>
     <l n="79">Awhile to wait upon the firm fair sand ,</l>
     <l n="80">When all is calm at sea , all still at land ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">And there the ocean 's produce to explore ,</l>
     <l n="82">As floating by , or rolling on the shore ;</l>
     <l n="83">Those living jellies<span type="note_anchor">[ 58 ]</span>which the flesh inflame ,</l>
     <l n="84">Fierce as a nettle , and from that its name ;</l>
     <l n="85">Some in huge masses , some that you may bring</l>
     <l n="86">In the small compass of a lady 's ring ;</l>
     <l n="87">Figured by hand divine — there 's not a gem</l>
     <l n="88">Wrought by man 's art to be compared to them ;</l>
     <l n="89">Soft , brilliant , tender , through the wave they glow ,</l>
     <l n="90">And make the moon-beam brighter where they flow . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Involved in sea-wrack , here you find a race ,</l>
     <l n="92">Which science , doubting , knows not where to place ;</l>
     <l n="93">On shell or stone is dropp 'd the embryo-seed ,</l>
     <l n="94">And quickly vegetates a vital breed<span type="note_anchor">[ 59 ]</span>.</l>
     <l n="95">While thus with pleasing wonder you inspect</l>
     <l n="96">Treasures the vulgar in their scorn reject ,</l>
     <l n="97">See as they float along th ’ entangled weeds</l>
     <l n="98">Slowly approach , upborne on bladdery beads ;</l>
     <l n="99">Wait till they land , and you shall then behold</l>
     <l n="100">The fiery sparks those tangled frons ’ infold , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Myriads of living points<span type="note_anchor">[ 60 ]</span>; th ’ unaided eye</l>
     <l n="102">Can but the fire and not the form descry .</l>
     <l n="103">And now your view upon the ocean turn ,</l>
     <l n="104">And there the splendour of the waves discern ;</l>
     <l n="105">Cast but a stone , or strike them with an oar ,</l>
     <l n="106">And you shall flames within the deep explore ;</l>
     <l n="107">Or scoop the stream phosphoric as you stand ,</l>
     <l n="108">And the cold flames shall flash along your hand ;</l>
     <l n="109">When , lost in wonder , you shall walk and gaze</l>
     <l n="110">On weeds that sparkle , and on waves that blaze<span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span>. 110</l>
     <l n="111">The ocean too has winter-views serene ,</l>
     <l n="112">When all you see through densest fog is seen ;</l>
     <l n="113">When you can hear the fishers near at hand</l>
     <l n="114">Distinctly speak , yet see not where they stand ;</l>
     <l n="115">Or sometimes them and not their boat discern ,</l>
     <l n="116">Or half-conceal 'd some figure at the stern ;</l>
     <l n="117">The view 's all bounded , and from side to side</l>
     <l n="118">Your utmost prospect but a few ells wide ;</l>
     <l n="119">Boys who , on shore , to sea the pebble cast ,</l>
     <l n="120">Will hear it strike against the viewless mast ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">While the stern boatman growls his fierce disdain ,</l>
     <l n="122">At whom he knows not , whom he threats in vain .</l>
     <l n="123">‘ Tis pleasant then to view the nets float past ,</l>
     <l n="124">Net after net till you have seen the last ;</l>
     <l n="125">And as you wait till all beyond you slip ,</l>
     <l n="126">A boat comes gliding from an anchor 'd ship ,</l>
     <l n="127">Breaking the silence with the dipping oar</l>
     <l n="128">And their own tones , as labouring for the shore —</l>
     <l n="129">Those measured tones which with the scene agree ,</l>
     <l n="130">And give a sadness to serenity . 130</l>
     <l n="131">All scenes like these the tender maid should shun ,</l>
     <l n="132">Nor to a misty beach in autumn run ;</l>
     <l n="133">Much should she guard against the evening cold ,</l>
     <l n="134">And her slight shape with fleecy warmth infold ;</l>
     <l n="135">This she admits , but not with so much ease</l>
     <l n="136">Gives up the night-walk when th ’ attendants please .</l>
     <l n="137">Her have I seen , pale , vapour 'd through the day ,</l>
     <l n="138">With crowded parties at the midnight play ;</l>
     <l n="139">Faint in the morn , no powers could she exert ;</l>
     <l n="140">At night with Pam delighted and alert ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">In a small shop she 's raffled with a crowd ,</l>
     <l n="142">Breathed the thick air , and cough 'd and laugh 'd aloud ;</l>
     <l n="143">She , who will tremble if her eye explore</l>
     <l n="144">“ The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor ; ”</l>
     <l n="145">Whom the kind doctor charged , with shaking head ,</l>
     <l n="146">At early hour to quit the beaux for bed :</l>
     <l n="147">She has , contemning fear , gone down the dance ,</l>
     <l n="148">Till she perceived the rosy morn advance ;</l>
     <l n="149">Then has she wonder 'd , fainting o'er her tea ,</l>
     <l n="150">Her drops and juleps should so useless be : 150</l>
     <l n="151">Ah ! sure her joys must ravish every sense ,</l>
     <l n="152">Who buys a portion at so vast expense .</l>
     <l n="153">Among those joys , ‘ tis one at eve to sail</l>
     <l n="154">On the broad river with a favourite gale ;</l>
     <l n="155">When no rough waves upon the bosom ride ,</l>
     <l n="156">But the keel cuts , nor rises on the tide ;</l>
     <l n="157">Safe from the stream the nearer gunwale stands ,</l>
     <l n="158">Where playful children trail their idle hands ,</l>
     <l n="159">Or strive to catch long grassy leaves that float</l>
     <l n="160">On either side of the impeded boat : 160</l>
     <l n="161">What time the moon , arising , shows the mud</l>
     <l n="162">A shining border to the silver flood ;</l>
     <l n="163">When , by her dubious light , the meanest views ,</l>
     <l n="164">Chalk , stones , and stakes , obtain the richest hues ;</l>
     <l n="165">And when the cattle , as they gazing stand ,</l>
     <l n="166">Seem nobler objects than when view 'd from land .</l>
     <l n="167">Then anchor 'd vessels in the way appear ,</l>
     <l n="168">And sea-boys greet them as they pass — “ What cheer ? ”</l>
     <l n="169">The sleeping shell-ducks at the sound arise ,</l>
     <l n="170">And utter loud their unharmonious cries ; 170</l>
     <l n="171">Fluttering , they move their weedy beds among ,</l>
     <l n="172">Or , instant diving , hide their plumeless young .</l>
     <l n="173">Along the wall , returning from the town ,</l>
     <l n="174">The weary rustic homeward wanders down ;</l>
     <l n="175">Who stops and gazes at such joyous crew ,</l>
     <l n="176">And feels his envy rising at the view ;</l>
     <l n="177">He the light speech and laugh indignant hears ,</l>
     <l n="178">And feels more press 'd by want , more vex 'd by fears .</l>
     <l n="179">Ah ! go in peace , good fellow , to thine home ,</l>
     <l n="180">Nor fancy these escape the general doom ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">Gay as they seem , be sure with them are hearts</l>
     <l n="182">With sorrow tried ; there 's sadness in their parts .</l>
     <l n="183">If thou couldst see them when they think alone ,</l>
     <l n="184">Mirth , music , friends , and these amusements gone ;</l>
     <l n="185">Couldst thou discover every secret ill</l>
     <l n="186">That pains their spirit , or resists their will ;</l>
     <l n="187">Couldst thou behold forsaken Love 's distress ,</l>
     <l n="188">Or Envy 's pang at glory and success ,</l>
     <l n="189">Or Beauty , conscious of the spoils of Time ,</l>
     <l n="190">Or Guilt , alarm 'd when Memory shows the crime — 190</l>
     <l n="191">All that gives sorrow , terror , grief , and gloom :</l>
     <l n="192">Content would cheer thee , trudging to thine home<span type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>.</l>
     <l n="193">There are , ‘ tis true , who lay their cares aside ,</l>
     <l n="194">And bid some hours in calm enjoyment glide ;</l>
     <l n="195">Perchance some fair-one to the sober night</l>
     <l n="196">Adds ( by the sweetness of her song ) delight ;</l>
     <l n="197">And , as the music on the water floats ,</l>
     <l n="198">Some bolder shore returns the soften 'd notes ;</l>
     <l n="199">Then , youth , beware , for all around conspire</l>
     <l n="200">To banish caution and to wake desire ; 200</l>
     <l n="201">The day 's amusement , feasting , beauty , wine , }</l>
     <l n="202">These accents sweet and this soft hour combine , }</l>
     <l n="203">When most unguarded , then to win that heart of thine : }</l>
     <l n="204">But see , they land ! the fond enchantment flies ,</l>
     <l n="205">And in its place life 's common views arise .</l>
     <l n="206">Sometimes a party , row 'd from town , will land</l>
     <l n="207">On a small islet form 'd of shelly sand ,</l>
     <l n="208">Left by the water when the tides are low ,</l>
     <l n="209">But which the floods in their return o'erflow :</l>
     <l n="210">There will they anchor , pleased awhile to view 210</l>
     <l n="211">The watery waste , a prospect wild and new ;</l>
     <l n="212">The now receding billows give them space</l>
     <l n="213">On either side the growing shores to pace ;</l>
     <l n="214">And then , returning , they contract the scene ,</l>
     <l n="215">Till small and smaller grows the walk between ,</l>
     <l n="216">As sea to sea approaches , shore to shores ,</l>
     <l n="217">Till the next ebb the sandy isle restores .</l>
     <l n="218">Then what alarm ! what danger and dismay ,</l>
     <l n="219">If all their trust , their boat should drift away ;</l>
     <l n="220">And once it happen 'd — gay the friends advanced ; 220</l>
     <l n="221">They walk 'd , they ran , they play 'd , they sang , they danced ;</l>
     <l n="222">The urns were boiling , and the cups went round ,</l>
     <l n="223">And not a grave or thoughtful face was found ;</l>
     <l n="224">On the bright sand they trod with nimble feet ,</l>
     <l n="225">Dry shelly sand that made the summer-seat ;</l>
     <l n="226">The wondering mews flew fluttering o'er the head ,</l>
     <l n="227">And waves ran softly up their shining bed .</l>
     <l n="228">Some form 'd a party from the rest to stray ,</l>
     <l n="229">Pleased to collect the trifles in their way ;</l>
     <l n="230">These to behold , they call their friends around — 230</l>
     <l n="231">No friends can hear , or hear another sound ;</l>
     <l n="232">Alarm 'd , they hasten , yet perceive not why ,</l>
     <l n="233">But catch the fear that quickens as they fly .</l>
     <l n="234">For lo ! a lady sage , who paced the sand</l>
     <l n="235">With her fair children , one in either hand ,</l>
     <l n="236">Intent on home , had turn 'd , and saw the boat</l>
     <l n="237">Slipp 'd from her moorings , and now far afloat ;</l>
     <l n="238">She gazed , she trembled , and though faint her call ,</l>
     <l n="239">It seem 'd , like thunder , to confound them all .</l>
     <l n="240">Their sailor-guides , the boatman and his mate , 240</l>
     <l n="241">Had drank , and slept regardless of their state ;</l>
     <l n="242">“ Awake ! ” they cried aloud ; “ Alarm the shore !</l>
     <l n="243">“ Shout all , or never shall we reach it more ! ”</l>
     <l n="244">Alas ! no shout the distant land can reach ,</l>
     <l n="245">Nor eye behold them from the foggy beach .</l>
     <l n="246">Again they join in one loud , powerful cry , }</l>
     <l n="247">Then cease , and eager listen for reply ; }</l>
     <l n="248">None came — the rising wind blew sadly by . }</l>
     <l n="249">They shout once more , and then they turn aside ,</l>
     <l n="250">To see how quickly flow 'd the coming tide ; 250</l>
     <l n="251">Between each cry they find the waters steal</l>
     <l n="252">On their strange prison , and new horrors feel ;</l>
     <l n="253">Foot after foot on the contracted ground</l>
     <l n="254">The billows fall , and dreadful is the sound ;</l>
     <l n="255">Less and yet less the sinking isle became ,</l>
     <l n="256">And there was wailing , weeping , wrath , and blame .</l>
     <l n="257">Had one been there , with spirit strong and high ,</l>
     <l n="258">Who could observe , as he prepared to die :</l>
     <l n="259">He might have seen of hearts the varying kind ,</l>
     <l n="260">And traced the movement of each different mind ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">He might have seen , that not the gentle maid</l>
     <l n="262">Was more than stern and haughty man afraid ;</l>
     <l n="263">Such calmly grieving , will their fears suppress ,</l>
     <l n="264">And silent prayers to Mercy 's throne address ;</l>
     <l n="265">While fiercer minds , impatient , angry , loud ,</l>
     <l n="266">Force their vain grief on the reluctant crowd .</l>
     <l n="267">The party 's patron , sorely sighing , cried ,</l>
     <l n="268">“ Why would you urge me ? I at first denied . ”</l>
     <l n="269">Fiercely they answer 'd , “ Why will you complain ,</l>
     <l n="270">“ Who saw no danger , or was warn 'd in vain ? ” 270</l>
     <l n="271">A few essay 'd the troubled soul to calm ;</l>
     <l n="272">But dread prevail 'd , and anguish and alarm .</l>
     <l n="273">Now rose the water through the lessening sand ,</l>
     <l n="274">And they seem 'd sinking while they yet could stand ;</l>
     <l n="275">The sun went down , they look 'd from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="276">Nor aught except the gathering sea descried ;</l>
     <l n="277">Dark and more dark , more wet , more cold it grew ,</l>
     <l n="278">And the most lively bade to hope adieu ;</l>
     <l n="279">Children , by love then lifted from the seas ,</l>
     <l n="280">Felt not the waters at the parents ’ knees , 280</l>
     <l n="281">But wept aloud ; the wind increased the sound ,</l>
     <l n="282">And the cold billows as they broke around .</l>
     <l n="283">“ Once more , yet once again , with all our strength ,</l>
     <l n="284">Cry to the land — we may be heard at length . ”</l>
     <l n="285">Vain hope , if yet unseen ! but hark ! an oar ,</l>
     <l n="286">That sound of bliss ! comes dashing to their shore ;</l>
     <l n="287">Still , still the water rises ; “ Haste ! ” they cry ,</l>
     <l n="288">“ Oh ! hurry , seamen ; in delay we die ; ”</l>
     <l n="289">( Seamen were these , who in their ship perceived</l>
     <l n="290">The drifted boat , and thus her crew relieved . ) 290</l>
     <l n="291">And now the keel just cuts the cover 'd sand ,</l>
     <l n="292">Now to the gunwale stretches every hand ;</l>
     <l n="293">With trembling pleasure all confused embark ,</l>
     <l n="294">And kiss the tackling of their welcome ark ;</l>
     <l n="295">While the most giddy , as they reach the shore ,</l>
     <l n="296">Think of their danger , and their GOD adore .</l>

   <p>Some of the smaller species of the Medusa ( sea-nettle ) are exquisitely beautiful : their form is nearly oval , varied with serrated longitudinal lines ; they are extremely tender , and by no means which I am acquainted with can be preserved , for they soon dissolve in either spirit of wine or water , and lose every vestige of their shape , and indeed of their substance : the larger species are found in mis-shapen masses of many pounds weight ; these , when handled , have the effect of the nettle , and the stinging is often accompanied or succeeded by the more unpleasant feeling , perhaps in a slight degree resembling that caused by the torpedo .</p>

   <p>And quickly vegetates a vital breed .</p>
   <p>Various tribes and species of marine vermes are here meant : that which so nearly resembles a vegetable in its form , and perhaps , in some degree , manner of growth , is the coralline called by naturalists Sertularia , of which there are many species in almost every part of the coast . The animal protrudes its many claws ( apparently in search of prey ) from certain pellucid vesicles which proceed from a horny , tenacious , branchy stem .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">You say you envy in your calm retreat</l>
     <l n="2">Our social meetings ;— ‘ tis with joy we meet .</l>
     <l n="3">In these our parties you are pleased to find</l>
     <l n="4">Good sense and wit , with intercourse of mind ;</l>
     <l n="5">Composed of men , who read , reflect , and write ;</l>
     <l n="6">Who , when they meet , must yield and share delight .</l>
     <l n="7">To you our Book-club has peculiar charm ,</l>
     <l n="8">For which you sicken in your quiet farm ;</l>
     <l n="9">Here you suppose us at our leisure placed ,</l>
     <l n="10">Enjoying freedom , and displaying taste ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">With wisdom cheerful , temperately gay ,</l>
     <l n="12">Pleased to enjoy , and willing to display .</l>
     <l n="13">If thus your envy gives your ease its gloom ,</l>
     <l n="14">Give wings to fancy , and among us come .</l>
     <l n="15">We 're now assembled ; you may soon attend —</l>
     <l n="16">I 'll introduce you — “ Gentlemen , my friend . ” —</l>
     <l n="17">“ Now are you happy ? you have pass 'd a night</l>
     <l n="18">In gay discourse , and rational delight . ” —</l>
     <l n="19">“ Alas ! not so ; for how can mortals think ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or thoughts exchange , if thus they eat and drink ? 20</l>
     <l n="21">No ! I confess , when we had fairly dined ,</l>
     <l n="22">That was no time for intercourse of mind ;</l>
     <l n="23">There was each dish prepared with skill t ’ invite ,</l>
     <l n="24">And to detain the struggling appetite ;</l>
     <l n="25">On such occasions minds with one consent</l>
     <l n="26">Are to the comforts of the body lent ;</l>
     <l n="27">There was no pause — the wine went quickly round ,</l>
     <l n="28">Till struggling Fancy was by Bacchus bound ;</l>
     <l n="29">Wine is to wit as water thrown on fire :</l>
     <l n="30">By duly sprinkling , both are raised the higher ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Thus largely dealt , the vivid blaze they choke ,</l>
     <l n="32">And all the genial flame goes off in smoke . ” —</l>
     <l n="33">“ But when no more your boards these loads contain ,</l>
     <l n="34">When wine no more o'erwhelms the labouring brain ,</l>
     <l n="35">But serves , a gentle stimulus : we know</l>
     <l n="36">How wit must sparkle , and how fancy flow . ” —</l>
     <l n="37">It might be so , but no such club-days come ;</l>
     <l n="38">We always find these dampers in the room .</l>
     <l n="39">If to converse were all that brought us here ,</l>
     <l n="40">A few odd members would in turn appear ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Who , dwelling nigh , would saunter in and out ,</l>
     <l n="42">O'erlook the list , and toss the books about ;</l>
     <l n="43">Or , yawning , read them , walking up and down ,</l>
     <l n="44">Just as the loungers in the shops in town ;</l>
     <l n="45">Till , fancying nothing would their minds amuse ,</l>
     <l n="46">They 'd push them by , and go in search of news .</l>
     <l n="47">But our attractions are a stronger sort ,</l>
     <l n="48">The earliest dainties and the oldest port ;</l>
     <l n="49">All enter then with glee in every look ,</l>
     <l n="50">And not a member thinks about a book . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Still let me own , there are some vacant hours ,</l>
     <l n="52">When minds might work , and men exert their powers :</l>
     <l n="53">Ere wine to folly spurs the giddy guest ,</l>
     <l n="54">But gives to wit its vigour and its zest ;</l>
     <l n="55">Then might we reason , might in turn display</l>
     <l n="56">Our several talents , and be wisely gay ;</l>
     <l n="57">We might — but who a tame discourse regards ,</l>
     <l n="58">When whist is named , and we behold the cards ?</l>
     <l n="59">We from that time are neither grave nor gay ;</l>
     <l n="60">Our thought , our care , our business is to play : 60</l>
     <l n="61">Fix 'd on these spots and figures , each attends</l>
     <l n="62">Much to his partners , nothing to his friends .</l>
     <l n="63">Our public cares , the long , the warm debate ,</l>
     <l n="64">That kept our patriots from their beds so late ;</l>
     <l n="65">War , peace , invasion , all we hope or dread ,</l>
     <l n="66">Vanish like dreams when men forsake their bed ;</l>
     <l n="67">And groaning nations and contending kings</l>
     <l n="68">Are all forgotten for these painted things :</l>
     <l n="69">Paper and paste , vile figures and poor spots ,</l>
     <l n="70">Level all minds , philosophers and sots ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">And give an equal spirit , pause , and force ,</l>
     <l n="72">Join 'd with peculiar diction , to discourse :</l>
     <l n="73">“ Who deals ?— you led — we 're three by cards — had you</l>
     <l n="74">Honour in hand ? ” — “ Upon my honour , two . ”</l>
     <l n="75">Hour after hour , men thus contending sit ,</l>
     <l n="76">Grave without sense , and pointed without wit .</l>
     <l n="77">Thus it appears these envied clubs possess</l>
     <l n="78">No certain means of social happiness ;</l>
     <l n="79">Yet there 's a good that flows from scenes like these —</l>
     <l n="80">Man meets with man at leisure and at ease ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">We to our neighbours and our equals come ,</l>
     <l n="82">And rub off pride that man contracts at home ;</l>
     <l n="83">For there , admitted master , he is prone</l>
     <l n="84">To claim attention and to talk alone :</l>
     <l n="85">But here he meets with neither son nor spouse ;</l>
     <l n="86">No humble cousin to his bidding bows ;</l>
     <l n="87">To his raised voice his neighbours ’ voices rise ;</l>
     <l n="88">To his high look as lofty look replies ;</l>

     <l n="378">This is a scene which few companions grace ,</l>
     <l n="379">And where the heart 's first favourites yield their place .</l>
     <l n="380">Here all the aid of man to man must end , 380</l>
     <l n="381">Here mounts the soul to her eternal Friend ;</l>
     <l n="382">The tenderest love must here its tie resign ,</l>
     <l n="383">And give th ’ aspiring heart to love divine .</l>
     <l n="384">Men feel their weakness , and to numbers run ,</l>
     <l n="385">Themselves to strengthen , or themselves to shun ;</l>
     <l n="386">But though to this our weakness may be prone ,</l>
     <l n="387">Let 's learn to live , for we must die , alone .</l>

     <l n="1">Much do I need , and therefore will I ask ,</l>
     <l n="2">A Muse to aid me in my present task ;</l>
     <l n="3">For then with special cause we beg for aid ,</l>
     <l n="4">When of our subject we are most afraid :</l>
     <l n="5">Inns are this subject — ‘ tis an ill-drawn lot ;</l>
     <l n="6">So , thou who gravely triflest , fail me not .</l>
     <l n="7">Fail not , but haste , and to my memory bring</l>
     <l n="8">Scenes yet unsung , which few would choose to sing :</l>
     <l n="9">Thou mad'st a Shilling splendid ; thou hast thrown</l>
     <l n="10">On humble themes the graces all thine own ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">By thee the Mistress of a village-school</l>
     <l n="12">Became a queen , enthroned upon her stool ;</l>
     <l n="13">And far beyond the rest thou gav'st to shine</l>
     <l n="14">Belinda 's Lock — that deathless work was thine .</l>
     <l n="15">Come , lend thy cheerful light , and give to please</l>
     <l n="16">These seats of revelry , these scenes of ease ;</l>
     <l n="17">Who sings of Inns much danger has to dread ,</l>
     <l n="18">And needs assistance from the fountain-head .</l>
     <l n="19">High in the street , o'erlooking all the place ,</l>
     <l n="20">The rampant Lion shows his kingly face ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">His ample jaws extend from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="22">His eyes are glaring , and his nostrils wide ;</l>
     <l n="23">In silver shag the sovereign form is dress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="24">A mane horrific sweeps his ample chest ;</l>
     <l n="25">Elate with pride , he seems t ’ assert his reign ,</l>
     <l n="26">And stands , the glory of his wide domain .</l>
     <l n="27">Yet nothing dreadful to his friends the sight ,</l>
     <l n="28">But sign and pledge of welcome and delight :</l>
     <l n="29">To him the noblest guest the town detains</l>
     <l n="30">Flies for repast , and in his court remains ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Him too the crowd with longing looks admire ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sigh for his joys , and modestly retire ;</l>
     <l n="33">Here not a comfort shall to them be lost</l>
     <l n="34">Who never ask or never feel the cost .</l>
     <l n="35">The ample yards on either side contain</l>
     <l n="36">Buildings where order and distinction reign ;—</l>
     <l n="37">The splendid carriage of the wealthier guest ,</l>
     <l n="38">The ready chaise and driver smartly dress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="39">Whiskeys and gigs and curricles are there ,</l>
     <l n="40">And high-fed prancers , many a raw-boned pair . 40</l>
     <l n="41">On all without a lordly host sustains</l>
     <l n="42">The care of empire , and observant reigns ;</l>
     <l n="43">The parting guest beholds him at his side ,</l>
     <l n="44">With pomp obsequious , bending in his pride ;</l>
     <l n="45">Round all the place his eyes all objects meet ,</l>
     <l n="46">Attentive , silent , civil , and discreet .</l>
     <l n="47">O'er all within the lady-hostess rules ,</l>
     <l n="48">Her bar she governs , and her kitchen schools ;</l>
     <l n="49">To every guest th ’ appropriate speech is made ,</l>
     <l n="50">And every duty with distinction paid : 50</l>
     <l n="51">Respectful , easy , pleasant , or polite —</l>
     <l n="52">“ Your honour 's servant — Mister Smith , good night . ”</l>
     <l n="53">Next , but not near , yet honour 'd through the town ,</l>
     <l n="54">There swing , incongruous pair ! the Bear and Crown ;</l>
     <l n="55">That Crown suspended gems and ribands deck ,</l>
     <l n="56">A golden chain hangs o'er that furry neck .</l>
     <l n="57">Unlike the nobler beast , the Bear is bound ,</l>
     <l n="58">And with the Crown so near him , scowls uncrown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="59">Less his dominion , but alert are all</l>
     <l n="60">Without , within , and ready for the call ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">Smart lads and light run nimbly here and there ,</l>
     <l n="62">Nor for neglected duties mourns the Bear .</l>
     <l n="63">To his retreats , on the election-day ,</l>
     <l n="64">The losing party found their silent way ;</l>
     <l n="65">There they partook of each consoling good ,</l>
     <l n="66">Like him uncrown 'd , like him in sullen mood —</l>
     <l n="67">Threat'ning , but bound .— Here meet a social kind ,</l>
     <l n="68">Our various clubs , for various cause combined ;</l>
     <l n="69">Nor has he pride , but thankful takes as gain</l>
     <l n="70">The dew-drops shaken from the Lion 's mane : 70</l>
     <l n="71">A thriving couple here their skill display ,</l>
     <l n="72">And share the profits of no vulgar sway .</l>
     <l n="73">Third in our Borough 's list appears the sign</l>
     <l n="74">Of a fair queen — the gracious Caroline ;</l>
     <l n="75">But in decay — each feature in the face</l>
     <l n="76">Has stain of Time , and token of disgrace .</l>
     <l n="77">The storm of winter , and the summer-sun ,</l>
     <l n="78">Have on that form their equal mischief done ;</l>
     <l n="79">The features now are all disfigured seen ,</l>
     <l n="80">And not one charm adorns th ’ insulted queen : 80</l>
     <l n="81">To this poor face was never paint applied ,</l>
     <l n="82">Th ’ unseemly work of cruel Time to hide ;</l>
     <l n="83">Here we may rightly such neglect upbraid ;</l>
     <l n="84">Paint on such faces is by prudence laid .</l>
     <l n="85">Large the domain , but all within combine</l>
     <l n="86">To correspond with the dishonour 'd sign ;</l>
     <l n="87">And all around dilapidates ; you call —</l>
     <l n="88">But none replies — they 're inattentive all .</l>
     <l n="89">At length a ruin 'd stable holds your steed ,</l>
     <l n="90">While you through large and dirty rooms proceed , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Spacious and cold ; a proof they once had been</l>
     <l n="92">In honour — now magnificently mean ;</l>
     <l n="93">Till in some small half-furnish 'd room you rest ,</l>
     <l n="94">Whose dying fire denotes it had a guest .</l>
     <l n="95">In those you pass 'd where former splendour reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="96">You saw the carpets torn , the paper stain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="97">Squares of discordant glass in windows fix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="98">And paper oil 'd in many a space betwixt ;</l>
     <l n="99">A soil 'd and broken sconce ; a mirror crack 'd ,</l>
     <l n="100">With table underpropp 'd , and chairs new-back 'd ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">A marble side-slab with ten thousand stains ,</l>
     <l n="102">And all an ancient tavern 's poor remains .</l>
     <l n="103">With much entreaty , they your food prepare ,</l>
     <l n="104">And acid wine afford , with meagre fare ;</l>
     <l n="105">Heartless you sup ; and when a dozen times</l>
     <l n="106">You 've read the fractured window 's senseless rhymes ;</l>
     <l n="107">Have been assured that Phoebe Green was fair ,</l>
     <l n="108">And Peter Jackson took his supper there :</l>
     <l n="109">You reach a chilling chamber , where you dread</l>
     <l n="110">Damps , hot or cold , from a tremendous bed ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Late comes your sleep , and you are waken 'd soon</l>
     <l n="112">By rustling tatters of the old festoon .</l>
     <l n="113">O'er this large building , thus by time defaced ,</l>
     <l n="114">A servile couple has its owner placed ,</l>
     <l n="115">Who , not unmindful that its style is large ,</l>
     <l n="116">To lost magnificence adapt their charge .</l>
     <l n="117">Thus an old beauty , who has long declined ,</l>
     <l n="118">Keeps former dues and dignity in mind ;</l>
     <l n="119">And wills that all attention should be paid</l>
     <l n="120">For graces vanish 'd and for charms decay 'd . 120</l>
     <l n="121">Few years have pass 'd , since brightly ‘ cross the way</l>
     <l n="122">Lights from each window shot the lengthen 'd ray ,</l>
     <l n="123">And busy looks in every face were seen ,</l>
     <l n="124">Through the warm precincts of the reigning Queen .</l>
     <l n="125">There fires inviting blazed , and all around</l>
     <l n="126">Was heard the tinkling bells ’ seducing sound ;</l>
     <l n="127">The nimble waiters to that sound from far</l>
     <l n="128">Sprang to the call , then hasten 'd to the bar ;</l>
     <l n="129">Where a glad priestess of the temple sway 'd ,</l>
     <l n="130">The most obedient , and the most obey 'd ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">Rosy and round , adorn 'd in crimson vest ,</l>
     <l n="132">And flaming ribands at her ample breast ,</l>
     <l n="133">She , skill 'd like Circe , tried her guests to move</l>
     <l n="134">With looks of welcome and with words of love ;</l>
     <l n="135">And such her potent charms , that men unwise</l>
     <l n="136">Were soon transform 'd and fitted for the sties .</l>
     <l n="137">Her port in bottles stood , a well-stain 'd row ,</l>
     <l n="138">Drawn for the evening from the pipe below ;</l>
     <l n="139">Three powerful spirits fill 'd a parted case ;</l>
     <l n="140">Some cordial-bottles stood in secret place ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Fair acid fruits in nets above were seen ;</l>
     <l n="142">Her plate was splendid , and her glasses clean ;</l>
     <l n="143">Basins and bowls were ready on the stand ,</l>
     <l n="144">And measures clatter 'd in her powerful hand .</l>
     <l n="145">Inferior houses now our notice claim ,</l>
     <l n="146">But who shall deal them their appropriate fame ?</l>
     <l n="147">Who shall the nice , yet known distinction , tell ,</l>
     <l n="148">Between the peal complete and single bell ?</l>
     <l n="149">Determine , ye , who on your shining nags</l>
     <l n="150">Wear oil-skin beavers and bear seal-skin bags ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">Or ye , grave topers , who with coy delight</l>
     <l n="152">Snugly enjoy the sweetness of the night ;</l>
     <l n="153">Ye travellers all , superior inns denied</l>
     <l n="154">By moderate purse , the low by decent pride :</l>
     <l n="155">Come and determine ,— will ye take your place</l>
     <l n="156">At the full orb , or half the lunar face ?</l>
     <l n="157">With the Black-Boy or Angel will ye dine ?</l>
     <l n="158">Will ye approve the Fountain or the Vine ?</l>
     <l n="159">Horses the white or black will ye prefer ?</l>
     <l n="160">The Silver-Swan , or swan opposed to her — 160</l>
     <l n="161">Rare bird ! whose form the raven-plumage decks ,</l>
     <l n="162">And graceful curve her three alluring necks ?</l>
     <l n="163">All these a decent entertainment give ,</l>
     <l n="164">And by their comforts comfortably live .</l>
     <l n="165">Shall I pass by the Boar ?— there are who cry ,</l>
     <l n="166">“ Beware the Boar , ” and pass determined by :</l>
     <l n="167">Those dreadful tusks , those little peering eyes</l>
     <l n="168">And churning chaps , are tokens to the wise .</l>
     <l n="169">There dwells a kind old aunt , and there you see</l>
     <l n="170">Some kind young nieces in her company — 170</l>
     <l n="171">Poor village nieces , whom the tender dame</l>
     <l n="172">Invites to town , and gives their beauty fame ;</l>
     <l n="173">The grateful sisters feel th ’ important aid ,</l>
     <l n="174">And the good aunt is flatter 'd and repaid .</l>
     <l n="175">What though it may some cool observers strike ,</l>
     <l n="176">That such fair sisters should be so unlike ;</l>
     <l n="177">That still another and another comes ,</l>
     <l n="178">And at the matron 's table smiles and blooms ;</l>
     <l n="179">That all appear as if they meant to stay</l>
     <l n="180">Time undefined , nor name a parting day ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">And yet , though all are valued , all are dear ,</l>
     <l n="182">Causeless , they go , and seldom more appear :</l>
     <l n="183">Yet — let Suspicion hide her odious head ,</l>
     <l n="184">And Scandal vengeance from a burgess dread —</l>
     <l n="185">A pious friend , who with the ancient dame</l>
     <l n="186">At sober cribbage takes an evening game ;</l>
     <l n="187">His cup beside him , through their play he quaffs ,</l>
     <l n="188">And oft renews , and innocently laughs ;</l>
     <l n="189">Or , growing serious , to the text resorts ,</l>
     <l n="190">And from the Sunday-sermon makes reports ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">While all , with grateful glee , his wish attend ,</l>
     <l n="192">A grave protector and a powerful friend .</l>
     <l n="193">But Slander says , who indistinctly sees ,</l>
     <l n="194">Once he was caught with Silvia on his knees —</l>
     <l n="195">A cautious burgess with a careful wife</l>
     <l n="196">To be so caught !— ‘ tis false , upon my life .</l>
     <l n="197">Next are a lower kind , yet not so low</l>
     <l n="198">But they , among them , their distinctions know ;</l>
     <l n="199">And , when a thriving landlord aims so high</l>
     <l n="200">As to exchange the Chequer for the Pye , 200</l>
     <l n="201">Or from Duke William to the Dog repairs ,</l>
     <l n="202">He takes a finer coat and fiercer airs .</l>
     <l n="203">Pleased with his power , the poor man loves to say</l>
     <l n="204">What favourite inn shall share his evening 's pay ;</l>
     <l n="205">Where he shall sit the social hour , and lose</l>
     <l n="206">His past day 's labours and his next day 's views .</l>
     <l n="207">Our seamen too have choice : one takes a trip</l>
     <l n="208">In the warm cabin of his favourite ship ;</l>
     <l n="209">And on the morrow in the humbler boat</l>
     <l n="210">He rows , till fancy feels herself afloat ; 210</l>
     <l n="211">Can he the sign — Three Jolly Sailors pass ,</l>
     <l n="212">Who hears a fiddle and who sees a lass ?</l>
     <l n="213">The Anchor too affords the seaman joys ,</l>
     <l n="214">In small smoked room , all clamour , crowd , and noise ;</l>
     <l n="215">Where a curved settle half surrounds the fire ,</l>
     <l n="216">Where fifty voices purl and punch require .</l>
     <l n="217">They come for pleasure in their leisure hour ,</l>
     <l n="218">And they enjoy it to their utmost power ;</l>
     <l n="219">Standing they drink , they swearing smoke , while all</l>
     <l n="220">Call or make ready for a second call : 220</l>
     <l n="221">There is no time for trifling — “ Do ye see ?</l>
     <l n="222">We drink and drub the French extempore . ”</l>
     <l n="223">See ! round the room , on every beam and balk ,</l>
     <l n="224">Are mingled scrolls of hieroglyphic chalk ;</l>
     <l n="225">Yet nothing heeded — would one stroke suffice</l>
     <l n="226">To blot out all , here honour is too nice —</l>
     <l n="227">“ Let knavish landsmen think such dirty things ,</l>
     <l n="228">We 're British tars , and British tars are kings . ”</l>
     <l n="229">But the Green-Man shall I pass by unsung ,</l>
     <l n="230">Which mine own James upon his sign-post hung ? 230</l>
     <l n="231">His sign , his image ,— for he once was seen</l>
     <l n="232">A squire 's attendant , clad in keeper 's green ;</l>
     <l n="233">Ere yet , with wages more , and honour less ,</l>
     <l n="234">He stood behind me in a graver dress .</l>
     <l n="235">James in an evil hour went forth to woo</l>
     <l n="236">Young Juliet Hart , and was her Romeo :</l>
     <l n="237">They 'd seen the play , and thought it vastly sweet</l>
     <l n="238">For two young lovers by the moon to meet ;</l>
     <l n="239">The nymph was gentle , of her favours free ,</l>
     <l n="240">Ev'n at a word — no Rosalind was she ; 240</l>
     <l n="241">Nor , like that other Juliet , tried his truth</l>
     <l n="242">With — “ Be thy purpose marriage , gentle youth ? ”</l>
     <l n="243">But him received , and heard his tender tale ,</l>
     <l n="244">When sang the lark , and when the nightingale :</l>
     <l n="245">So in few months the generous lass was seen</l>
     <l n="246">I ’ the way that all the Capulets had been .</l>
     <l n="247">Then first repentance seized the amorous man ,</l>
     <l n="248">And — shame on love — he reason 'd and he ran ;</l>
     <l n="249">The thoughtful Romeo trembled for his purse ,</l>
     <l n="250">And the sad sounds , “ for better and for worse . ” 250</l>
     <l n="251">Yet could the lover not so far withdraw ,</l>
     <l n="252">But he was haunted both by love and law :</l>
     <l n="253">Now law dismay 'd him as he view 'd its fangs ,</l>
     <l n="254">Now pity seized him for his Juliet 's pangs ;</l>
     <l n="255">Then thoughts of justice and some dread of jail ,</l>
     <l n="256">Where all would blame him and where none might bail ;</l>
     <l n="257">These drew him back , till Juliet 's hut appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="258">Where love had drawn him when he should have fear 'd .</l>
     <l n="259">There sat the father in his wicker throne ,</l>
     <l n="260">Uttering his curses in tremendous tone ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">With foulest names his daughter he reviled ,</l>
     <l n="262">And look 'd a very Herod at the child :</l>
     <l n="263">Nor was she patient , but with equal scorn ,</l>
     <l n="264">Bade him remember when his Joe was born :</l>
     <l n="265">Then rose the mother , eager to begin</l>
     <l n="266">Her plea for frailty , when the swain came in .</l>
     <l n="267">To him she turn 'd , and other theme began ,</l>
     <l n="268">Show 'd him his boy , and bade him be a man —</l>
     <l n="269">“ An honest man , who , when he breaks the laws ,</l>
     <l n="270">Will make a woman honest if there 's cause . ” 270</l>
     <l n="271">With lengthened speech she proved what came to pass</l>
     <l n="272">Was no reflection on a loving lass :</l>
     <l n="273">“ If she your love as wife and mother claim ,</l>
     <l n="274">What can it matter which was first the name ?</l>
     <l n="275">But ‘ tis most base , ‘ tis perjury and theft ,</l>
     <l n="276">When a lost girl is like a widow left ;</l>
     <l n="277">The rogue who ruins ” — here the father found</l>
     <l n="278">His spouse was treading on forbidden ground .</l>
     <l n="279">“ That 's not the point , ” quoth he ,— “ I do n't suppose</l>
     <l n="280">My good friend Fletcher to be one of those ; 280</l>
     <l n="281">What 's done amiss he 'll mend in proper time —</l>
     <l n="282">I hate to hear of villany and crime .</l>
     <l n="283">‘ Twas my misfortune , in the days of youth ,</l>
     <l n="284">To find two lasses pleading for my truth ;</l>
     <l n="285">The case was hard , I would with all my soul</l>
     <l n="286">Have wedded both , but law is our control ;</l>
     <l n="287">So one I took , and when we gain 'd a home ,</l>
     <l n="288">Her friend agreed — what could she more ?— to come ;</l>
     <l n="289">And when she found that I 'd a widow 'd bed ,</l>
     <l n="290">Me she desired — what could I less ?— to wed. 290</l>
     <l n="291">An easier case is yours : you 've not the smart</l>
     <l n="292">That two fond pleaders cause in one man 's heart ;</l>
     <l n="293">You 've not to wait from year to year distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="294">Before your conscience can be laid at rest ;</l>
     <l n="295">There smiles your bride , there sprawls your new-born son ,</l>
     <l n="296">— A ring , a licence , and the thing is done . ”</l>
     <l n="297">“ My loving James , ” — the lass began her plea ,</l>
     <l n="298">“ I 'll make thy reason take a part with me .</l>
     <l n="299">Had I been froward , skittish , or unkind ,</l>
     <l n="300">Or to thy person or thy passion blind ; 300</l>
     <l n="301">Had I refused , when ‘ twas thy part to pray ,</l>
     <l n="302">Or put thee off with promise and delay ;</l>
     <l n="303">Thou might'st in justice and in conscience fly ,</l>
     <l n="304">Denying her who taught thee to deny :</l>
     <l n="305">But , James , with me thou hadst an easier task ,</l>
     <l n="306">Bonds and conditions I forbore to ask ;</l>
     <l n="307">“ I laid no traps for thee , no plots or plans ,</l>
     <l n="308">Nor marriage named by licence or by banns ;</l>
     <l n="309">Nor would I now the parson 's aid employ ,</l>
     <l n="310">But for this cause ” — and up she held her boy . 310</l>
     <l n="311">Motives like these could heart of flesh resist ?</l>
     <l n="312">James took the infant and in triumph kiss 'd ;</l>
     <l n="313">Then to his mother 's arms the child restored ,</l>
     <l n="314">Made his proud speech , and pledged his worthy word .</l>
     <l n="315">“ Three times at church our banns shall publish 'd be ,</l>
     <l n="316">Thy health be drunk in bumpers three times three ;</l>
     <l n="317">And thou shalt grace ( bedeck 'd in garments gay )</l>
     <l n="318">The christening-dinner on the wedding day . ”</l>
     <l n="319">James at my door then made his parting bow ,</l>
     <l n="320">Took the Green-Man , and is a master now . 320</l>

     <l n="20">To take each part , and act in every age . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Cull 'd from all houses , what a house are they !</l>
     <l n="22">Swept from all barns , our borough-critics say ;</l>
     <l n="23">But with some portion of a critic 's ire ,</l>
     <l n="24">We all endure them ; there are some admire :</l>
     <l n="25">They might have praise , confined to farce alone ;</l>
     <l n="26">Full well they grin — they should not try to groan ;</l>

     <l n="38">And vends each night the manufactured man .</l>

     <l n="47">Of crown and palace , throne and guards bereft ,</l>
     <l n="48">The pomp is vanish 'd , and the care is left .</l>
     <l n="49">Yet strong and lively is the joy they feel ,</l>
     <l n="50">When the full house secures the plenteous meal ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Flatt'ring and flatter 'd , each attempts to raise</l>
     <l n="52">A brother 's merits for a brother 's praise :</l>
     <l n="53">For never hero shows a prouder heart ,</l>

     <l n="56">Place for fierce contest , like the tented field .</l>
     <l n="57">Graceful to tread the stage , to be in turn</l>
     <l n="58">The prince we honour , and the knave we spurn ;</l>
     <l n="59">Bravely to bear the tumult of the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="60">The hiss tremendous , and the censure loud : 60</l>
     <l n="61">These are their parts — and he who these sustains</l>
     <l n="62">Deserves some praise and profit for his pains .</l>
     <l n="63">Heroes at least of gentler kind are they , }</l>
     <l n="64">Against whose swords no weeping widows pray , }</l>
     <l n="65">No blood their fury sheds , nor havoc marks their way . }</l>
     <l n="66">Sad happy race ! soon raised and soon depress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="67">Your days all pass 'd in jeopardy and jest ;</l>
     <l n="68">Poor without prudence , with afflictions vain ,</l>
     <l n="69">Not warn 'd by misery , not enrich 'd by gain ;</l>
     <l n="70">Whom justice pitying , chides from place to place , 70</l>
     <l n="71">A wandering , careless , wretched , merry race ;</l>
     <l n="72">Who cheerful looks assume , and play the parts</l>
     <l n="73">Of happy rovers with repining hearts ;</l>
     <l n="74">Then cast off care , and in the mimic pain</l>
     <l n="75">Of tragic wo , feel spirits light and vain ,</l>
     <l n="76">Distress and hope — the mind 's , the body 's wear ,</l>
     <l n="77">The man 's affliction , and the actor 's tear :</l>
     <l n="78">Alternate times of fasting and excess</l>
     <l n="79">Are yours , ye smiling children of distress .</l>
     <l n="80">Slaves though ye be , your wandering freedom seems , 80 }</l>
     <l n="81">And with your varying views and restless schemes , }</l>
     <l n="82">Your griefs are transient , as your joys are dreams . }</l>
     <l n="83">Yet keen those griefs — ah ! what avail thy charms ,</l>
     <l n="84">Fair Juliet ! what that infant in thine arms ;</l>
     <l n="85">What those heroic lines thy patience learns ,</l>
     <l n="86">What all the aid thy present Romeo earns ,</l>
     <l n="87">Whilst thou art crowded in that lumbering wain ,</l>
     <l n="88">With all thy plaintive sisters to complain ?</l>
     <l n="89">Nor is there lack of labour .— To rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="90">Day after day , poor scraps of prose and verse ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">To bear each other 's spirit , pride , and spite ;</l>
     <l n="92">To hide in rant the heart-ache of the night ;</l>
     <l n="93">To dress in gaudy patch-work , and to force</l>
     <l n="94">The mind to think on the appointed course :</l>
     <l n="95">This is laborious , and may be defined</l>
     <l n="96">The bootless labour of the thriftless mind .</l>
     <l n="97">There is a veteran dame — I see her stand</l>
     <l n="98">Intent and pensive with her book in hand ;</l>
     <l n="99">Awhile her thoughts she forces on her part ,</l>
     <l n="100">Then dwells on objects nearer to the heart ; 100</l>
     <l n="101">Across the room she paces , gets her tone ,</l>
     <l n="102">And fits her features for the Danish throne ;</l>
     <l n="103">To-night a queen — I mark her motion slow ,</l>
     <l n="104">I hear her speech , and Hamlet 's mother know .</l>
     <l n="105">Methinks ‘ tis pitiful to see her try</l>
     <l n="106">For strength of arms and energy of eye ;</l>
     <l n="107">With vigour lost , and spirits worn away ,</l>
     <l n="108">Her pomp and pride she labours to display ;</l>
     <l n="109">And when awhile she 's tried her part to act ,</l>
     <l n="110">To find her thoughts arrested by some fact ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">When struggles more and more severe are seen</l>
     <l n="112">In the plain actress than the Danish queen ;—</l>
     <l n="113">At length she feels her part , she finds delight ,</l>
     <l n="114">And fancies all the plaudits of the night :</l>
     <l n="115">Old as she is , she smiles at every speech ,</l>
     <l n="116">And thinks no youthful part beyond her reach .</l>
     <l n="117">But , as the mist of vanity again</l>
     <l n="118">Is blown away by press of present pain ,</l>
     <l n="119">Sad and in doubt she to her purse applies</l>
     <l n="120">For cause of comfort , where no comfort lies ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">Then to her task she sighing turns again ,—</l>
     <l n="122">“ Oh ! Hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain ! ”</l>
     <l n="123">And who that poor , consumptive , wither 'd thing ,</l>
     <l n="124">Who strains her slender throat and strives to sing ?</l>
     <l n="125">Panting for breath , and forced her voice to drop ,</l>
     <l n="126">And far unlike the inmate of the shop ,</l>
     <l n="127">Where she , in youth and health , alert and gay ,</l>
     <l n="128">Laugh 'd off at night the labours of the day ;</l>
     <l n="129">With novels , verses , fancy 's fertile powers ,</l>
     <l n="130">And sister-converse pass 'd the evening-hours ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">But Cynthia 's soul was soft , her wishes strong ,</l>
     <l n="132">Her judgment weak , and her conclusions wrong .</l>
     <l n="133">The morning-call and counter were her dread ,</l>
     <l n="134">And her contempt the needle and the thread ;</l>
     <l n="135">But , when she read a gentle damsel 's part ,</l>
     <l n="136">Her wo , her wish — she had them all by heart .</l>
     <l n="137">At length the hero of the boards drew nigh ,</l>
     <l n="138">Who spake of love till sigh re-echo 'd sigh ;</l>
     <l n="139">He told in honey 'd words his deathless flame ,</l>
     <l n="140">And she his own by tender vows became ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Nor ring nor licence needed souls so fond ,</l>
     <l n="142">Alphonso 's passion was his Cynthia 's bond :</l>
     <l n="143">And thus the simple girl , to shame betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="144">Sinks to the grave forsaken and dismay 'd .</l>
     <l n="145">Sick without pity , sorrowing without hope ,</l>
     <l n="146">See her , the grief and scandal of the troop ;</l>
     <l n="147">A wretched martyr to a childish pride ,</l>
     <l n="148">Her wo insulted , and her praise denied ;</l>
     <l n="149">Her humble talents , though derided , used ,</l>
     <l n="150">Her prospects lost , her confidence abused ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">All that remains — for she not long can brave</l>
     <l n="152">Increase of evils — is an early grave ,</l>
     <l n="153">Ye gentle Cynthias of the shop , take heed</l>
     <l n="154">What dreams ye cherish , and what books ye read .</l>
     <l n="155">A decent sum had Peter Nottage made ,</l>
     <l n="156">By joining bricks — to him a thriving trade .</l>
     <l n="157">Of his employment master and his wife ,</l>
     <l n="158">This humble tradesman led a lordly life ;</l>
     <l n="159">The house of kings and heroes lack 'd repairs ,</l>
     <l n="160">And Peter , though reluctant , served the players : 160</l>
     <l n="161">Connected thus , he heard in way polite ,—</l>
     <l n="162">“ Come , Master Nottage , see us play to-night . ”</l>
     <l n="163">At first ‘ twas folly , nonsense , idle stuff ,</l>
     <l n="164">But seen for nothing it grew well enough ;</l>
     <l n="165">And better now — now best , and every night</l>
     <l n="166">In this fool 's paradise he drank delight ;</l>
     <l n="167">And , as he felt the bliss , he wish 'd to know</l>
     <l n="168">Whence all this rapture and these joys could flow ;</l>
     <l n="169">For , if the seeing could such pleasure bring ,</l>
     <l n="170">What must the feeling ?— feeling like a king ? 170</l>
     <l n="171">In vain his wife , his uncle , and his friend ,</l>
     <l n="172">Cried — “ Peter ! Peter ! let such follies end ;</l>
     <l n="173">‘ Tis well enough these vagabonds to see ,</l>
     <l n="174">But would you partner with a showman be ? ”</l>
     <l n="175">“ Showman ! ” said Peter , “ did not Quin and Clive ,</l>
     <l n="176">And Roscius-Garrick , by the science thrive ?</l>
     <l n="177">Showman !— ‘ tis scandal ; I 'm by genius led</l>
     <l n="178">To join a class who 've Shakspeare at their head . ”</l>
     <l n="179">Poor Peter thus by easy steps became</l>
     <l n="180">A dreaming candidate for scenic fame ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">And , after years consumed , infirm and poor ,</l>
     <l n="182">He sits and takes the tickets at the door .</l>
     <l n="183">Of various men these marching troops are made —</l>
     <l n="184">Pen-spurning clerks , and lads contemning trade ;</l>
     <l n="185">Waiters and servants by confinement teased ,</l>
     <l n="186">And youths of wealth by dissipation eased ;</l>
     <l n="187">With feeling nymphs , who , such resource at hand ,</l>
     <l n="188">Scorn to obey the rigour of command ;</l>
     <l n="189">Some , who from higher views by vice are won ,</l>
     <l n="190">And some of either sex by love undone ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">The greater part lamenting as their fall</l>
     <l n="192">What some an honour and advancement call .</l>
     <l n="193">There are who names in shame or fear assume ,</l>
     <l n="194">And hence our Bevilles and our Savilles come :</l>
     <l n="195">It honours him , from tailor 's board kick 'd down ,</l>
     <l n="196">As Mister Dormer to amuse the town ;</l>
     <l n="197">Falling , he rises : but a kind there are</l>
     <l n="198">Who dwell on former prospects , and despair ;</l>
     <l n="199">Justly , but vainly , they their fate deplore ,</l>
     <l n="200">And mourn their fall who fell to rise no more . 200</l>
     <l n="201">Our merchant Thompson , with his sons around ,</l>
     <l n="202">Most mind and talent in his Frederick found :</l>
     <l n="203">He was so lively , that his mother knew ,</l>
     <l n="204">If he were taught , that honour must ensue ;</l>
     <l n="205">The father 's views were in a different line ;</l>
     <l n="206">But if at college he were sure to shine ,</l>
     <l n="207">Then should he go — to prosper , who could doubt —</l>
     <l n="208">When school-boy stigmas would be all wash 'd out ;</l>
     <l n="209">For there were marks upon his youthful face ,</l>
     <l n="210">‘ Twixt vice and error — a neglected case : 210</l>
     <l n="211">These would submit to skill ; a little time ,</l>
     <l n="212">And none could trace the error or the crime ;</l>
     <l n="213">Then let him go , and once at college , he</l>
     <l n="214">Might choose his station — what would Frederick be ?</l>
     <l n="215">‘ Twas soon determined .— He could not descend</l>
     <l n="216">To pedant-laws and lectures without end ;</l>
     <l n="217">And then the chapel — night and morn to pray ,</l>
     <l n="218">Or mulct and threaten 'd if he kept away ;</l>
     <l n="219">No ! not to be a bishop — so he swore ,</l>
     <l n="220">And at his college he was seen no more . 220</l>
     <l n="221">His debts all paid , the father with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="222">Placed him in office — “ Do , my Frederick , try ;</l>
     <l n="223">“ Confine thyself a few short months , and then —— ”</l>
     <l n="224">He tried a fortnight , and threw down the pen .</l>
     <l n="225">Again demands were hush 'd : “ My son , you 're free ,</l>
     <l n="226">But you 're unsettled ; take your chance at sea : ”</l>
     <l n="227">So in few days the midshipman equipp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="228">Received the mother 's blessing and was shipp 'd .</l>
     <l n="229">Hard was her fortune ! soon compell 'd to meet</l>
     <l n="230">The wretched stripling staggering through the street ; 230</l>
     <l n="231">For , rash , impetuous , insolent and vain ,</l>
     <l n="232">The captain sent him to his friends again .</l>
     <l n="233">About the borough roved th ’ unhappy boy ,</l>
     <l n="234">And ate the bread of every chance-employ ;</l>
     <l n="235">Of friends he borrow 'd , and the parents yet</l>
     <l n="236">In secret fondness authorised the debt ;</l>
     <l n="237">The younger sister , still a child , was taught</l>
     <l n="238">To give with feign 'd affright the pittance sought ;</l>
     <l n="239">For now the father cried — “ It is too late</l>
     <l n="240">For trial more — I leave him to his fate ” — 240</l>
     <l n="241">Yet left him not ; and with a kind of joy</l>
     <l n="242">The mother heard of her desponding boy :</l>
     <l n="243">At length he sicken 'd , and he found , when sick ,</l>
     <l n="244">All aid was ready , all attendance quick ;</l>
     <l n="245">A fever seized him , and at once was lost</l>
     <l n="246">The thought of trespass , error , crime and cost ;</l>
     <l n="247">Th ’ indulgent parents knelt beside the youth ;</l>
     <l n="248">They heard his promise and believed his truth ;</l>
     <l n="249">And , when the danger lessen 'd on their view ,</l>
     <l n="250">They cast off doubt , and hope assurance grew ;— 250</l>
     <l n="251">Nursed by his sisters , cherish 'd by his sire ,</l>
     <l n="252">Begg 'd to be glad , encouraged to aspire ,</l>
     <l n="253">His life , they said , would now all care repay ,</l>
     <l n="254">And he might date his prospects from that day ;</l>
     <l n="255">A son , a brother to his home received ,</l>
     <l n="256">They hoped for all things , and in all believed .</l>
     <l n="257">And now will pardon , comfort , kindness , draw</l>
     <l n="258">The youth from vice ? will honour , duty , law ?</l>
     <l n="259">Alas ! not all : the more the trials lent ,</l>
     <l n="260">The less he seem 'd to ponder and repent ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">Headstrong , determined in his own career ,</l>
     <l n="262">He thought reproof unjust and truth severe ;</l>
     <l n="263">The soul 's disease was to its crisis come ,</l>
     <l n="264">He first abused and then abjured his home ;</l>
     <l n="265">And when he chose a vagabond to be ,</l>
     <l n="266">He made his shame his glory — “ I 'll be free . ”</l>
     <l n="267">Friends , parents , relatives , hope , reason , love ,</l>
     <l n="268">With anxious ardour for that empire strove ;</l>
     <l n="269">In vain their strife , in vain the means applied ,</l>
     <l n="270">They had no comfort , but that all were tried ; 270</l>
     <l n="271">One strong vain trial made , the mind to move ,</l>
     <l n="272">Was the last effort of parental love .</l>
     <l n="273">Ev'n then he watch 'd his father from his home ,</l>
     <l n="274">And to his mother would for pity come ,</l>
     <l n="275">Where , as he made her tender terrors rise ,</l>
     <l n="276">He talk 'd of death , and threaten 'd for supplies .</l>
     <l n="277">Against a youth so vicious and undone</l>
     <l n="278">All hearts were closed , and every door but one :</l>
     <l n="279">The players received him ; they with open heart</l>
     <l n="280">Gave him his portion and assign 'd his part ; 280</l>
     <l n="281">And ere three days were added to his life ,</l>
     <l n="282">He found a home , a duty , and a wife .</l>
     <l n="283">His present friends , though they were nothing nice ,</l>
     <l n="284">Nor ask 'd how vicious he , or what his vice ,</l>
     <l n="285">Still they expected he should now attend</l>
     <l n="286">To the joint duty as an useful friend ;</l>
     <l n="287">The leader too declared , with frown severe ,</l>
     <l n="288">That none should pawn a robe that kings might wear ;</l>
     <l n="289">And much it moved him , when he Hamlet play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="290">To see his Father 's Ghost so drunken made . 290</l>
     <l n="291">Then too the temper , the unbending pride</l>
     <l n="292">Of this ally would no reproof abide :—</l>
     <l n="293">So , leaving these , he march 'd away and join 'd</l>
     <l n="294">Another troop , and other goods purloin 'd ;</l>
     <l n="295">And other characters , both gay and sage ,</l>
     <l n="296">Sober and sad , made stagger on the stage ;</l>
     <l n="297">Then to rebuke , with arrogant disdain ,</l>
     <l n="298">He gave abuse , and sought a home again .</l>
     <l n="299">Thus changing scenes , but with unchanging vice ,</l>
     <l n="300">Engaged by many , but with no one twice : 300</l>
     <l n="301">Of this , a last and poor resource , bereft ,</l>
     <l n="302">He to himself , unhappy guide ! was left —</l>
     <l n="303">And who shall say where guided ? to what seats</l>
     <l n="304">Of starving villany ? of thieves and cheats ?</l>
     <l n="305">In that sad time , of many a dismal scene</l>
     <l n="306">Had he a witness ( not inactive ) been ;</l>
     <l n="307">Had leagued with petty pilferers , and had crept ,</l>
     <l n="308">Where of each sex degraded numbers slept .</l>
     <l n="309">With such associates he was long allied , }</l>
     <l n="310">Where his capacity for ill was tried , 310 }</l>
     <l n="311">And , that once lost , the wretch was cast aside ; }</l>
     <l n="312">For now , though willing with the worst to act ,</l>
     <l n="313">He wanted powers for an important fact ;</l>
     <l n="314">And , while he felt as lawless spirits feel ,</l>
     <l n="315">His hand was palsied , and he could n't steal .</l>
     <l n="316">By these rejected , is there lot so strange ,</l>
     <l n="317">So low , that he could suffer by the change ?</l>
     <l n="318">Yes ! the new station as a fall we judge —</l>
     <l n="319">He now became the harlot 's humble drudge ,</l>
     <l n="320">Their drudge in common : they combined to save 320</l>
     <l n="321">Awhile from starving their submissive slave ;</l>
     <l n="322">For now his spirit left him , and his pride ,</l>
     <l n="323">His scorn , his rancour , and resentment died ;</l>
     <l n="324">Few were his feelings — but the keenest these ,</l>
     <l n="325">The rage of hunger , and the sigh for ease ;</l>
     <l n="326">He who abused indulgence , now became</l>
     <l n="327">By want subservient and by misery tame ;</l>
     <l n="328">A slave , he begg 'd forbearance ; bent with pain ,</l>
     <l n="329">He shunn 'd the blow — “ Ah ! strike me not again . ”</l>
     <l n="330">Thus was he found : the master of a hoy 330</l>
     <l n="331">Saw the sad wretch , whom he had known a boy</l>
     <l n="332">At first in doubt ; but Frederick laid aside</l>
     <l n="333">All shame , and humbly for his aid applied .</l>
     <l n="334">He , tamed and smitten with the storms gone by ,</l>
     <l n="335">Look 'd for compassion through one living eye ,</l>
     <l n="336">And stretch 'd th ’ unpalsied hand ; the seaman felt }</l>
     <l n="337">His honest heart with gentle pity melt , }</l>
     <l n="338">And his small boon with cheerful frankness dealt ; }</l>
     <l n="339">Then made inquiries of th ’ unhappy youth ,</l>
     <l n="340">Who told , nor shame forbade him , all the truth . 340</l>
     <l n="341">“ Young Frederick Thompson to a chandler 's shop</l>
     <l n="342">By harlots order 'd and afraid to stop !—</l>
     <l n="343">What ! our good merchant 's favourite to be seen</l>
     <l n="344">In state so loathsome and in dress so mean ? ” —</l>
     <l n="345">So thought the seaman as he bade adieu ,</l>
     <l n="346">And , when in port , related all he knew .</l>
     <l n="347">But time was lost , inquiry came too late ,</l>
     <l n="348">Those whom he served knew nothing of his fate ;</l>
     <l n="349">No ! they had seized on what the sailor gave ,</l>
     <l n="350">Nor bore resistance from their abject slave ; 350</l>
     <l n="351">The spoil obtain 'd , they cast him from the door ,</l>
     <l n="352">Robb 'd , beaten , hungry , pain 'd , diseased and poor .</l>
     <l n="353">Then nature ( pointing to the only spot</l>
     <l n="354">Which still had comfort for so dire a lot ,)</l>
     <l n="355">Although so feeble , led him on the way ,</l>
     <l n="356">And hope look 'd forward to a happier day .</l>
     <l n="357">He thought , poor prodigal ! a father yet</l>
     <l n="358">His woes would pity and his crimes forget ;</l>
     <l n="359">Nor had he brother who with speech severe</l>
     <l n="360">Would check the pity or refrain the tear : 360</l>
     <l n="361">A lighter spirit in his bosom rose ,</l>
     <l n="362">As near the road he sought an hour 's repose .</l>
     <l n="363">And there he found it : he had left the town ,</l>
     <l n="364">But buildings yet were scatter 'd up and down ;</l>
     <l n="365">To one of these , half-ruin 'd and half-built ,</l>
     <l n="366">Was traced this child of wretchedness and guilt ;</l>
     <l n="367">There on the remnant of a beggar 's vest ,</l>
     <l n="368">Thrown by in scorn , the sufferer sought for rest ;</l>
     <l n="369">There was this scene of vice and wo to close ,</l>
     <l n="370">And there the wretched body found repose . 370</l>

     <l n="1">Leave now our streets , and in yon plain behold</l>
     <l n="2">Those pleasant seats for the reduced and old ;</l>
     <l n="3">A merchant 's gift , whose wife and children died ,</l>
     <l n="4">When he to saving all his powers applied ;</l>
     <l n="5">He wore his coat till bare was every thread ,</l>
     <l n="6">And with the meanest fare his body fed .</l>
     <l n="7">He had a female cousin , who with care</l>
     <l n="8">Walk 'd in his steps and learn 'd of him to spare ;</l>
     <l n="9">With emulation and success they strove ,</l>
     <l n="10">Improving still , still seeking to improve , 10</l>
     <l n="11">As if that useful knowledge they would gain —</l>
     <l n="12">How little food would human life sustain :</l>
     <l n="13">No pauper came their table 's crums to crave ;</l>
     <l n="14">Scraping they lived , but not a scrap they gave :</l>
     <l n="15">When beggars saw the frugal merchant pass ,</l>
     <l n="16">It moved their pity , and they said , “ Alas !</l>
     <l n="17">Hard is thy fate , my brother , ” and they felt</l>
     <l n="18">A beggar 's pride as they that pity dealt :</l>
     <l n="19">The dogs , who learn of man to scorn the poor ,</l>
     <l n="20">Bark 'd him away from ev'ry decent door ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">While they who saw him bare , but thought him rich ,</l>
     <l n="22">To show respect or scorn , they knew not which .</l>
     <l n="23">But while our merchant seem 'd so base and mean ,</l>
     <l n="24">He had his wanderings , sometimes , “ not unseen ; ”</l>
     <l n="25">To give in secret was a favourite act ,</l>
     <l n="26">Yet more than once they took him in the fact .</l>
     <l n="27">To scenes of various wo he nightly went ,</l>
     <l n="28">And serious sums in healing misery spent ;</l>
     <l n="29">Oft has he cheer 'd the wretched , at a rate</l>
     <l n="30">For which he daily might have dined on plate ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">He has been seen — his hair all silver-white , }</l>
     <l n="32">Shaking and shining — as he stole by night , }</l>
     <l n="33">To feed unenvied on his still delight . }</l>
     <l n="34">A two-fold taste he had : to give and spare ,</l>
     <l n="35">Both were his duties , and had equal care ;</l>
     <l n="36">It was his joy , to sit alone and fast ,</l>
     <l n="37">Then send a widow and her boys repast .</l>
     <l n="38">Tears in his eyes would , spite of him , appear ,</l>
     <l n="39">But he from other eyes has kept the tear :</l>
     <l n="40">All in a wint'ry night from far he came , 40</l>
     <l n="41">To soothe the sorrows of a suff'ring dame ;</l>
     <l n="42">Whose husband robb 'd him , and to whom he meant</l>
     <l n="43">A ling'ring , but reforming punishment .</l>
     <l n="44">Home then he walk 'd , and found his anger rise ,</l>
     <l n="45">When fire and rush-light met his troubled eyes ;</l>
     <l n="46">But , these extinguish 'd , and his prayer address 'd</l>
     <l n="47">To Heaven in hope , he calmly sank to rest .</l>
     <l n="48">His seventieth year was pass 'd , and then was seen</l>
     <l n="49">A building rising on the northern green ;</l>
     <l n="50">There was no blinding all his neighbours ’ eyes , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Or surely no one would have seen it rise .</l>
     <l n="52">Twelve rooms contiguous stood , and six were near ;</l>
     <l n="53">There men were placed , and sober matrons here ;</l>
     <l n="54">There were behind small useful gardens made ,</l>
     <l n="55">Benches before , and trees to give them shade ;</l>
     <l n="56">In the first room were seen , above , below ,</l>
     <l n="57">Some marks of taste , a few attempts at show ;</l>
     <l n="58">The founder 's picture and his arms were there</l>
     <l n="59">( Not till he left us ) , and an elbow 'd chair ;</l>
     <l n="60">There , ‘ mid these signs of his superior place , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Sat the mild ruler of this humble race .</l>
     <l n="62">Within the row are men who strove in vain ,</l>
     <l n="63">Through years of trouble , wealth and ease to gain ;</l>
     <l n="64">Less must they have than an appointed sum ,</l>
     <l n="65">And freemen been , or hither must not come ;</l>
     <l n="66">They should be decent and command respect</l>
     <l n="67">( Though needing fortune ,) whom these doors protect ,</l>
     <l n="68">And should for thirty dismal years have tried</l>
     <l n="69">For peace unfelt and competence denied .</l>
     <l n="70">Strange , that o'er men thus train 'd in sorrow 's school , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Power must be held , and they must live by rule !</l>
     <l n="72">Infirm , corrected by misfortunes , old ,</l>
     <l n="73">Their habits settled and their passions cold ;</l>
     <l n="74">Of health , wealth , power , and worldly cares , bereft ,</l>
     <l n="75">Still must they not at liberty be left ;</l>
     <l n="76">There must be one to rule them , to restrain</l>
     <l n="77">And guide the movements of his erring train .</l>
     <l n="78">If then control imperious , check severe ,</l>
     <l n="79">Be needed where such reverend men appear ;</l>
     <l n="80">To what would youth , without such checks , aspire , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Free the wild wish , uncurb 'd the strong desire ?</l>
     <l n="82">And where ( in college or in camp ) they found</l>
     <l n="83">The heart ungovern 'd and the hand unbound ?</l>
     <l n="84">His house endow 'd , the generous man resign 'd</l>
     <l n="85">All power to rule , nay power of choice declined ;</l>
     <l n="86">He and the female saint survived to view</l>
     <l n="87">Their work complete , and bade the world adieu !</l>
     <l n="88">Six are the guardians of this happy seat ,</l>
     <l n="89">And one presides when they on business meet ;</l>
     <l n="90">As each expires , the five a brother choose ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">Nor would Sir Denys Brand the charge refuse ;</l>
     <l n="92">True , ‘ twas beneath him , “ but to do men good</l>
     <l n="93">Was motive never by his heart withstood . ”</l>
     <l n="94">He too is gone , and they again must strive</l>
     <l n="95">To find a man in whom his gifts survive .</l>
     <l n="96">Now , in the various records of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="97">Thy worth , Sir Denys , shall be weigh 'd and read ;</l>

     <l n="99">With each alliance of thy noble race .</l>
     <l n="100">Yes ! here we have him !— “ Came in William 's reign 100</l>
     <l n="101">The Norman-Brand , the blood without a stain ;</l>
     <l n="102">From the fierce Dane and ruder Saxon clear ,</l>
     <l n="103">Pict , Irish , Scot , or Cambrian mountaineer ;</l>
     <l n="104">But the pure Norman was the sacred spring ,</l>
     <l n="105">And he , Sir Denys , was in heart a king :</l>
     <l n="106">Erect in person and so firm in soul ,</l>
     <l n="107">Fortune he seem 'd to govern and control ;</l>
     <l n="108">“ Generous as he who gives his all away ,</l>
     <l n="109">Prudent as one who toils for weekly pay ;</l>
     <l n="110">In him all merits were decreed to meet — 110</l>
     <l n="111">Sincere though cautious , frank and yet discreet ;</l>
     <l n="112">Just all his dealings , faithful every word ;</l>
     <l n="113">His passions ’ master , and his temper 's lord . ”</l>
     <l n="114">Yet more , kind dealers in decaying fame ?</l>
     <l n="115">His magnanimity you next proclaim ;</l>
     <l n="116">You give him learning , join 'd with sound good sense ,</l>
     <l n="117">And match his wealth with his benevolence ;</l>
     <l n="118">What hides the multitude of sins , you add —</l>
     <l n="119">Yet seem to doubt if sins he ever had .</l>
     <l n="120">Poor honest Truth ! thou writ'st of living men , 120</l>
     <l n="121">And art a railer and detractor then ;</l>
     <l n="122">They die , again to be described , and now</l>
     <l n="123">A foe to merit and mankind art thou !</l>
     <l n="124">Why banish truth ? it injures not the dead ;</l>
     <l n="125">It aids not them with flattery to be fed ;</l>
     <l n="126">And , when mankind such perfect pictures view ,</l>
     <l n="127">They copy less , the more they think them true .</l>
     <l n="128">Let us a mortal as he was behold ,</l>
     <l n="129">And see the dross adhering to the gold ;</l>
     <l n="130">When we the errors of the virtuous state , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Then erring men their worth may emulate .</l>
     <l n="132">View then this picture of a noble mind :</l>
     <l n="133">Let him be wise , magnanimous , and kind ;</l>
     <l n="134">What was the wisdom ? Was it not the frown</l>
     <l n="135">That keeps all question , all inquiry down ?</l>
     <l n="136">His words were powerful and decisive all ;</l>
     <l n="137">But his slow reasons came for no man 's call .</l>
     <l n="138">“ ‘ Tis thus , ” he cried , no doubt with kind intent ,</l>
     <l n="139">To give results and spare all argument .—</l>
     <l n="140">“ Let it be spared — all men at least agree 140</l>
     <l n="141">Sir Denys Brand had magnanimity :</l>
     <l n="142">His were no vulgar charities ; none saw</l>
     <l n="143">Him like the merchant to the hut withdraw ;</l>
     <l n="144">He left to meaner minds the simple deed ,</l>
     <l n="145">By which the houseless rest , the hungry feed ;</l>
     <l n="146">His was a public bounty vast and grand ;</l>
     <l n="147">‘ Twas not in him to work with viewless hand ;</l>
     <l n="148">He raised the room that towers above the street ,</l>
     <l n="149">A public room where grateful parties meet ;</l>
     <l n="150">He first the life-boat plann 'd ; to him the place 150</l>
     <l n="151">Is deep in debt — ‘ twas he reviv 'd the race ;</l>
     <l n="152">To every public act this hearty friend</l>
     <l n="153">Would give with freedom or with frankness lend ;</l>
     <l n="154">His money built the jail , nor prisoner yet</l>
     <l n="155">Sits at his ease , but he must feel the debt ;</l>
     <l n="156">To these let candour add his vast display — }</l>
     <l n="157">Around his mansion all is grand and gay , }</l>
     <l n="158">And this is bounty with the name of pay . ” }</l>
     <l n="159">I grant the whole , nor from one deed retract ,</l>
     <l n="160">But wish recorded too the private act ; 160</l>
     <l n="161">All these were great , but still our hearts approve</l>
     <l n="162">Those simpler tokens of the Christian love ;</l>
     <l n="163">‘ Twould give me joy some gracious deed to meet ,</l>
     <l n="164">That has not call 'd for glory through the street .</l>
     <l n="165">Who felt for many , could not always shun ,</l>
     <l n="166">In some soft moment , to be kind to one ;</l>
     <l n="167">And yet they tell us , when Sir Denys died ,</l>
     <l n="168">That not a widow in the Borough sigh 'd ;</l>
     <l n="169">Great were his gifts , his mighty heart I own ,</l>
     <l n="170">But why describe what all the world has known ? 170</l>
     <l n="171">The rest is petty pride , the useless art</l>
     <l n="172">Of a vain mind to hide a swelling heart .</l>
     <l n="173">Small was his private room ; men found him there</l>
     <l n="174">By a plain table , on a paltry chair ;</l>
     <l n="175">A wretched floor-cloth , and some prints around ,</l>
     <l n="176">The easy purchase of a single pound :</l>
     <l n="177">These humble trifles and that study small</l>
     <l n="178">Make a strong contrast with the servants ’ hall ;</l>
     <l n="179">There barely comfort , here a proud excess ,</l>
     <l n="180">The pompous seat of pamper 'd idleness , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Where the sleek rogues with one consent declare ,</l>
     <l n="182">They would not live upon his honour 's fare .</l>
     <l n="183">He daily took but one half-hour to dine ,</l>
     <l n="184">On one poor dish and some three sips of wine ;</l>
     <l n="185">Then he 'd abuse them for their sumptuous feasts ,</l>
     <l n="186">And say , “ My friends ! you make yourselves like beasts ;</l>
     <l n="187">One dish suffices any man to dine ,</l>
     <l n="188">But you are greedy as a herd of swine ;</l>
     <l n="189">Learn to be temperate . ” — Had they dared t ’ obey ,</l>
     <l n="190">He would have praised and turn 'd them all away . 190</l>
     <l n="191">Friends met Sir Denys riding in his ground ,</l>
     <l n="192">And there the meekness of his spirit found :</l>
     <l n="193">For that grey coat , not new for many a year ,</l>
     <l n="194">Hides all that would like decent dress appear ;</l>
     <l n="195">An old brown pony ‘ twas his will to ride ,</l>
     <l n="196">Who shuffled onward , and from side to side ;</l>
     <l n="197">A five-pound purchase , but so fat and sleek ,</l>
     <l n="198">His very plenty made the creature weak .</l>
     <l n="199">“ Sir Denys Brand ! and on so poor a steed ! ” —</l>
     <l n="200">“ Poor ! it may be — such things I never heed : ” 200</l>
     <l n="201">And who that youth behind , of pleasant mien ,</l>
     <l n="202">Equipp 'd as one who wishes to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="203">Upon a horse , twice victor for a plate ,</l>
     <l n="204">A noble hunter , bought at dearest rate ?—</l>
     <l n="205">Him the lad , fearing , yet resolved to guide ,</l>
     <l n="206">He curbs his spirit , while he strokes his pride .</l>
     <l n="207">“ A handsome youth , Sir Denys ; and a horse</l>
     <l n="208">Of finer figure never trod the course —</l>
     <l n="209">Yours , without question ? ” — “ Yes ! I think , a groom</l>
     <l n="210">Bought me the beast ; I cannot say the sum : 210</l>
     <l n="211">I ride him not , it is a foolish pride</l>
     <l n="212">Men have in cattle — but my people ride ;</l>
     <l n="213">The boy is — hark ye , sirrah ! what 's your name ?</l>
     <l n="214">Ay , Jacob , yes ! I recollect — the same ,</l>
     <l n="215">As I bethink me now , a tenant 's son —</l>
     <l n="216">I think a tenant — is your father one ? ”</l>
     <l n="217">There was an idle boy who ran about ,</l>
     <l n="218">And found his master 's humble spirit out ;</l>
     <l n="219">He would at awful distance snatch a look ,</l>
     <l n="220">Then run away and hide him in some nook ; 220</l>
     <l n="221">“ For oh ! ” quoth he , “ I dare not fix my sight</l>
     <l n="222">On him , his grandeur puts me in a fright ;</l>
     <l n="223">Oh ! Mister Jacob , when you wait on him ,</l>
     <l n="224">Do you not quake and tremble every limb ? ”</l>
     <l n="225">The steward soon had orders — “ Summers , see</l>
     <l n="226">That Sam be clothed , and let him wait on me . ”</l>

     <l n="227">Sir Denys died , bequeathing all affairs</l>

     <l n="229">Before a guardian ; and , Sir Denys dead ,</l>
     <l n="230">All rule and power devolved upon his head . 230</l>
     <l n="231">Numbers are call 'd to govern , but in fact</l>
     <l n="232">Only the powerful and assuming act .</l>
     <l n="233">Laughton , too wise to be a dupe to fame ,</l>
     <l n="234">Cared not a whit of what descent he came ,</l>
     <l n="235">Till he was rich ; he then conceived the thought</l>
     <l n="236">To fish for pedigree , but never caught .</l>
     <l n="237">All his desire , when he was young and poor ,</l>
     <l n="238">Was to advance ; he never cared for more :</l>
     <l n="239">“ Let me buy , sell , be factor , take a wife ,</l>
     <l n="240">Take any road to get along in life . ” 240</l>
     <l n="241">Was he a miser then ? a robber ? foe</l>
     <l n="242">To those who trusted ? a deceiver ?— No !</l>
     <l n="243">He was ambitious ; all his powers of mind</l>
     <l n="244">Were to one end controll 'd , improved , combined ;</l>
     <l n="245">Wit , learning , judgment , were , by his account ,</l>
     <l n="246">Steps for the ladder he design 'd to mount .</l>
     <l n="247">Such step was money : wealth was but his slave ,</l>
     <l n="248">For power he gain 'd it , and for power he gave ;</l>
     <l n="249">Full well the Borough knows that he 'd the art</l>
     <l n="250">Of bringing money to the surest mart ; 250</l>
     <l n="251">Friends too were aids , they led to certain ends ,</l>
     <l n="252">Increase of power and claim on other friends .</l>
     <l n="253">A favourite step was marriage : then he gain 'd</l>
     <l n="254">Seat in our hall , and o'er his party reign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="255">Houses and lands he bought , and long 'd to buy ,</l>
     <l n="256">But never drew the springs of purchase dry ;</l>
     <l n="257">And thus at last they answer 'd every call ,</l>
     <l n="258">The failing found him ready for their fall .</l>
     <l n="259">He walks along the street , the mart , the quay ,</l>
     <l n="260">And looks and mutters , “ This belongs to me . ” 260</l>
     <l n="261">His passions all partook the general bent ; }</l>
     <l n="262">Interest inform 'd him when he should resent , }</l>
     <l n="263">How long resist , and on what terms relent . }</l>
     <l n="264">In points where he determined to succeed ,</l>
     <l n="265">In vain might reason or compassion plead ;</l>
     <l n="266">But gain 'd his point , he was the best of men ,</l>
     <l n="267">‘ Twas loss of time to be vexatious then :</l>
     <l n="268">Hence he was mild to all men whom he led ,</l>
     <l n="269">Of all who dared resist the scourge and dread .</l>
     <l n="270">Falsehood in him was not the useless lie 270</l>
     <l n="271">Of boasting pride or laughing vanity ;</l>
     <l n="272">It was the gainful , the persuading art ,</l>
     <l n="273">That made its way and won the doubting heart ,</l>
     <l n="274">Which argued , soften 'd , humbled , and prevail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="275">Nor was it tried till ev'ry truth had fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="276">No sage on earth could more than he despise</l>
     <l n="277">Degrading , poor , unprofitable lies .</l>
     <l n="278">Though fond of gain , and grieved by wanton waste ,</l>
     <l n="279">To social parties he had no distaste ;</l>
     <l n="280">With one presiding purpose in his view , 280</l>
     <l n="281">He sometimes could descend to trifle too !</l>
     <l n="282">Yet , in these moments , he had still the art</l>
     <l n="283">To ope the looks and close the guarded heart ;</l>
     <l n="284">And , like the public host , has sometimes made</l>
     <l n="285">A grand repast , for which the guests have paid .</l>
     <l n="286">At length , with power endued and wealthy grown ,</l>
     <l n="287">Frailties and passions , long suppressed , were shown ;</l>
     <l n="288">Then , to provoke him was a dangerous thing ;</l>
     <l n="289">His pride would punish , and his temper sting ;</l>
     <l n="290">His powerful hatred sought th ’ avenging hour , 290</l>
     <l n="291">And his proud vengeance struck with all his power —</l>
     <l n="292">Save when th ’ offender took a prudent way</l>
     <l n="293">The rising storm of fury to allay .</l>
     <l n="294">This might he do , and so in safety sleep ,</l>
     <l n="295">By largely casting to the angry deep ;</l>
     <l n="296">Or , better yet ( its swelling force t ’ assuage ,)</l>
     <l n="297">By pouring oil of flattery on its rage .</l>
     <l n="298">And now , of all the heart approved , possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="299">Fear 'd , favour 'd , follow 'd , dreaded , and caress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="300">He gently yields to one mellifluous joy , 300</l>
     <l n="301">The only sweet that is not found to cloy ,</l>
     <l n="302">Bland adulation ! Other pleasures pall</l>
     <l n="303">On the sick taste , and transient are they all ;</l>
     <l n="304">But this one sweet has such enchanting power ,</l>
     <l n="305">The more we take , the faster we devour ;</l>
     <l n="306">Nauseous to those who must the dose apply ,</l>
     <l n="307">And most disgusting to the standers-by ;</l>
     <l n="308">Yet in all companies will Laughton feed ,</l>
     <l n="309">Nor care how grossly men perform the deed .</l>
     <l n="310">As gapes the nursling , or , what comes more near , 310</l>
     <l n="311">Some Friendly-island chief , for hourly cheer —</l>
     <l n="312">When wives and slaves , attending round his seat ,</l>
     <l n="313">Prepare by turns the masticated meat :</l>
     <l n="314">So for this master , husband , parent , friend ,</l>
     <l n="315">His ready slaves their various efforts blend ,</l>
     <l n="316">And , to their lord still eagerly inclined ,</l>
     <l n="317">Pour the crude trash of a dependent mind .</l>
     <l n="318">But let the muse assign the man his due ;</l>
     <l n="319">Worth he possess 'd , nor were his virtues few ;—</l>
     <l n="320">He sometimes help 'd the injured in their cause ; 320</l>
     <l n="321">His power and purse have back 'd the failing laws ;</l>
     <l n="322">He for religion has a due respect ,</l>
     <l n="323">And all his serious notions are correct ;</l>
     <l n="324">Although he pray 'd and languished for a son ,</l>
     <l n="325">He grew resigned when Heaven denied him one ;</l>
     <l n="326">He never to this quiet mansion sends</l>
     <l n="327">Subject unfit , in compliment to friends .</l>
     <l n="328">Not so Sir Denys , who would yet protest</l>
     <l n="329">He always chose the worthiest and the best :</l>
     <l n="330">Not men in trade by various loss brought down , 330</l>
     <l n="331">But those whose glory once amazed the town ;</l>
     <l n="332">Who their last guinea in their pleasures spent ,</l>
     <l n="333">Yet never fell so low as to repent ;</l>
     <l n="334">To these his pity he could largely deal ,</l>
     <l n="335">Wealth they had known , and therefore want could feel .</l>
     <l n="336">Three seats were vacant while Sir Denys reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="337">And three such favourites their admission gain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="338">These let us view , still more to understand</l>
     <l n="339">The moral feelings of Sir Denys Brand .</l>

     <l n="5">There wishes strong and stronger griefs are seen ,</l>
     <l n="6">Looks ever changed , and never one serene :</l>
     <l n="7">Show not that manner , and these features all ,</l>
     <l n="8">The serpent 's cunning and the sinner 's fall ?</l>
     <l n="9">Hark to that laughter !— ‘ tis the way he takes</l>
     <l n="10">To force applause for each vile jest he makes ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Such is yon man , by partial favour sent</l>
     <l n="12">To these calm seats to ponder and repent .</l>
     <l n="13">Blaney , a wealthy heir at twenty-one ,</l>
     <l n="14">At twenty-five was ruin 'd and undone :</l>
     <l n="15">These years with grievous crimes we need not load ,</l>
     <l n="16">He found his ruin in the common road ;—</l>
     <l n="17">Gamed without skill , without inquiry bought ,</l>
     <l n="18">Lent without love , and borrowed without thought .</l>
     <l n="19">But , gay and handsome , he had soon the dower</l>
     <l n="20">Of a kind wealthy widow in his power ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Then he aspired to loftier flights of vice ,</l>
     <l n="22">To singing harlots of enormous price ;</l>
     <l n="23">He took a jockey in his gig to buy</l>
     <l n="24">A horse , so valued that a duke was shy ;</l>
     <l n="25">To gain the plaudits of the knowing few ,</l>
     <l n="26">Gamblers and grooms , what would not Blaney do ?</l>
     <l n="27">His dearest friend , at that improving age ,</l>
     <l n="28">Was Hounslow Dick , who drove the western stage .</l>
     <l n="29">Cruel he was not .— If he left his wife ,</l>
     <l n="30">He left her to her own pursuits in life ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Deaf to reports , to all expenses blind ;</l>
     <l n="32">Profuse , not just , and careless , but not kind .</l>
     <l n="33">Yet , thus assisted , ten long winters pass 'd</l>
     <l n="34">In wasting guineas ere he saw his last ;</l>
     <l n="35">Then he began to reason , and to feel</l>
     <l n="36">He could not dig , nor had he learn 'd to steal ;</l>
     <l n="37">And should he beg as long as he might live ,</l>
     <l n="38">He justly fear 'd that nobody would give .</l>
     <l n="39">But he could charge a pistol , and , at will ,</l>
     <l n="40">All that was mortal by a bullet kill : 40</l>
     <l n="41">And he was taught , by those whom he would call</l>
     <l n="42">Man 's surest guides — that he was mortal all .</l>
     <l n="43">While thus he thought , still waiting for the day ,</l>
     <l n="44">When he should dare to blow his brains away ,</l>
     <l n="45">A place for him a kind relation found ,</l>
     <l n="46">Where England 's monarch ruled , but far from English ground ;</l>
     <l n="47">He gave employ that might for bread suffice ,</l>
     <l n="48">Correct his habits and restrain his vice .</l>
     <l n="49">Here Blaney tried ( what such man 's miseries teach )</l>
     <l n="50">To find what pleasures were within his reach ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">These he enjoy 'd , though not in just the style</l>
     <l n="52">He once possess 'd them in his native isle ;</l>
     <l n="53">Congenial souls he found in every place ,</l>
     <l n="54">Vice in all soils , and charms in every race :</l>
     <l n="55">His lady took the same amusing way ,</l>
     <l n="56">And laugh 'd at Time till he had turn 'd them grey :</l>
     <l n="57">At length for England once again they steer 'd ,</l>
     <l n="58">By ancient views and new designs endear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="59">His kindred died , and Blaney now became</l>
     <l n="60">An heir to one who never heard his name . 60</l>
     <l n="61">What could he now ?— The man had tried before</l>
     <l n="62">The joys of youth , and they were joys no more ;</l>
     <l n="63">To vicious pleasure he was still inclined ,</l>
     <l n="64">But vice must now be season 'd and refined ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then as a swine he would on pleasure seize ,</l>
     <l n="66">Now common pleasures had no power to please :</l>
     <l n="67">Beauty alone has for the vulgar charms ,</l>
     <l n="68">He wanted beauty trembling with alarms ;</l>
     <l n="69">His was no more a youthful dream of joy ,</l>
     <l n="70">The wretch desired to ruin and destroy ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">He bought indulgence with a boundless price ,</l>
     <l n="72">Most pleased when decency bow 'd down to vice ,</l>
     <l n="73">When a fair dame her husband 's honour sold ,</l>
     <l n="74">And a frail Countess play 'd for Blaney 's gold .</l>
     <l n="75">“ But did not conscience in her anger rise ? ”</l>
     <l n="76">Yes ! and he learn 'd her terrors to despise ;</l>
     <l n="77">When stung by thought , to soothing books he fled ,</l>
     <l n="78">And grew composed and hardened as he read ;</l>
     <l n="79">Tales of Voltaire , and essays gay and slight ,</l>
     <l n="80">Pleased him and shone with their phosphoric light ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Which , though it rose from objects vile and base ,</l>
     <l n="82">Where'er it came threw splendour on the place ,</l>
     <l n="83">And was that light which the deluded youth ,</l>
     <l n="84">And this grey sinner , deem 'd the light of truth .</l>
     <l n="85">He different works for different cause admired —</l>
     <l n="86">Some fix 'd his judgment , some his passions fired ;</l>
     <l n="87">To cheer the mind and raise a dormant flame , }</l>
     <l n="88">He had the books , decreed to lasting shame , }</l>
     <l n="89">Which those who read are careful not to name : }</l>
     <l n="90">These won to vicious act the yielding heart , 90</l>
     <l n="91">And then the cooler reasoners soothed the smart .</l>
     <l n="92">He heard of Blount , and Mandeville , and Chubb ,</l>
     <l n="93">How they the doctors of their day would drub ;</l>
     <l n="94">How Hume had dwelt on miracles so well ,</l>
     <l n="95">That none would now believe a miracle ;</l>
     <l n="96">And though he cared not works so grave to read ,</l>
     <l n="97">He caught their faith and sign 'd the sinner 's creed .</l>
     <l n="98">Thus was he pleased to join the laughing side ;</l>
     <l n="99">Nor ceased the laughter when his lady died .</l>
     <l n="100">Yet was he kind and careful of her fame , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And on her tomb inscribed a virtuous name :</l>
     <l n="102">“ A tender wife , respected , and so forth . ” —</l>
     <l n="103">The marble still bears witness to the worth .</l>
     <l n="104">He has some children , but he knows not where ;</l>
     <l n="105">Something they cost , but neither love nor care ;</l>
     <l n="106">A father 's feelings he has never known ,</l>
     <l n="107">His joys , his sorrows , have been all his own .</l>
     <l n="108">He now would build — and lofty seat he built ,</l>
     <l n="109">And sought , in various ways , relief from guilt .</l>
     <l n="110">Restless , for ever anxious to obtain 110</l>
     <l n="111">Ease for the heart by ramblings of the brain ,</l>
     <l n="112">He would have pictures , and of course a taste ,</l>
     <l n="113">And found a thousand means his wealth to waste .</l>
     <l n="114">Newmarket steeds he bought at mighty cost ;</l>
     <l n="115">They sometimes won , but Blaney always lost .</l>
     <l n="116">Quick came his ruin , came when he had still</l>
     <l n="117">For life a relish , and in pleasure skill :</l>
     <l n="118">By his own idle reckoning he supposed</l>
     <l n="119">His wealth would last him till his life was closed ;</l>
     <l n="120">But no ! he found his final hoard was spent , 120</l>
     <l n="121">While he had years to suffer and repent .</l>
     <l n="122">Yet at the last , his noble mind to show ,</l>
     <l n="123">And in his misery how he bore the blow ,</l>
     <l n="124">He view 'd his only guinea , then suppress 'd</l>
     <l n="125">For a short time , the tumults in his breast ,</l>
     <l n="126">And , moved by pride , by habit and despair ,</l>
     <l n="127">Gave it an opera-bird to hum an air .</l>
     <l n="128">Come ye ! who live for pleasure , come , behold</l>
     <l n="129">A man of pleasure when he 's poor and old ;</l>
     <l n="130">When he looks back through life , and cannot find 130</l>
     <l n="131">A single action to relieve his mind ;</l>
     <l n="132">When he looks forward , striving still to keep</l>
     <l n="133">A steady prospect of eternal sleep ;</l>
     <l n="134">When not one friend is left , of all the train</l>
     <l n="135">Whom ‘ twas his pride and boast to entertain —</l>
     <l n="136">Friends now employ 'd from house to house to run</l>
     <l n="137">And say , “ Alas ! poor Blaney is undone ! ” —</l>
     <l n="138">Those whom he shook with ardour by the hand ,</l>
     <l n="139">By whom he stood as long as he could stand ,</l>
     <l n="140">Who seem 'd to him from all deception clear , 140</l>
     <l n="141">And who , more strange ! might think themselves sincere .</l>
     <l n="142">Lo ! now the hero shuffling through the town ,</l>
     <l n="143">To hunt a dinner and to beg a crown ;</l>
     <l n="144">To tell an idle tale , that boys may smile ;</l>
     <l n="145">To bear a strumpet 's billet-doux a mile ;</l>
     <l n="146">To cull a wanton for a youth of wealth ,</l>
     <l n="147">( With [ reverent ] view to both his taste and health ) ;</l>
     <l n="148">To be a useful , needy thing between</l>
     <l n="149">Fear and desire — the pander and the screen ;</l>
     <l n="150">To flatter pictures , houses , horses , dress , 150</l>
     <l n="151">The wildest fashion or the worst excess ;</l>
     <l n="152">To be the grey seducer , and entice</l>
     <l n="153">Unbearded folly into acts of vice ;</l>
     <l n="154">And then , to level every fence which law</l>
     <l n="155">And virtue fix to keep the mind in awe ,</l>
     <l n="156">He first inveigles youth to walk astray , }</l>
     <l n="157">Next prompts and soothes them in their fatal way , }</l>
     <l n="158">Then vindicates the deed , and makes the mind his prey . }</l>
     <l n="159">Unhappy man ! what pains he takes to state</l>
     <l n="160">( Proof of his fear ! ) that all below is fate ; 160</l>
     <l n="161">That all proceed in one appointed track ,</l>
     <l n="162">Where none can stop , or take their journey back !</l>
     <l n="163">Then what is vice or virtue ?— Yet he 'll rail</l>
     <l n="164">At priests till memory and quotation fail ;</l>
     <l n="165">He reads , to learn the various ills they 've done ,</l>
     <l n="166">And calls them vipers , every mother 's son .</l>
     <l n="167">He is the harlot 's aid , who wheedling tries</l>
     <l n="168">To move her friend for vanity 's supplies ;</l>
     <l n="169">To weak indulgence he allures the mind ,</l>
     <l n="170">Loth to be duped , but willing to be kind ; 170</l>
     <l n="171">And if successful — what the labour pays ?</l>
     <l n="172">He gets the friend 's contempt and Chloe 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="173">Who , in her triumph , condescends to say ,</l>
     <l n="174">“ What a good creature Blaney was to-day ! ”</l>
     <l n="175">Hear the poor daemon when the young attend ,</l>
     <l n="176">And willing ear to vile experience lend ;</l>
     <l n="177">When he relates ( with laughing , leering eye )</l>
     <l n="178">The tale licentious , mix 'd with blasphemy :</l>
     <l n="179">No genuine gladness his narrations cause ,</l>
     <l n="180">The frailest heart denies sincere applause ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">And many a youth has turn 'd him half aside ,</l>
     <l n="182">And laugh 'd aloud , the sign of shame to hide .</l>
     <l n="183">Blaney , no aid in his vile cause to lose ,</l>
     <l n="184">Buys pictures , prints , and a licentious muse ;</l>
     <l n="185">He borrows every help from every art ,</l>
     <l n="186">To stir the passions and mislead the heart .</l>
     <l n="187">But from the subject let us soon escape ,</l>
     <l n="188">Nor give this feature all its ugly shape :</l>
     <l n="189">Some to their crimes escape from satire owe ;</l>
     <l n="190">Who shall describe what Blaney dares to show ? 190</l>
     <l n="191">While thus the man , to vice and passion slave ,</l>
     <l n="192">Was , with his follies , moving to the grave ,</l>
     <l n="193">The ancient ruler of this mansion died ,</l>
     <l n="194">And Blaney boldly for the seat applied .</l>
     <l n="195">Sir Denys Brand , then guardian , join 'd his suit ;</l>
     <l n="196">“ ‘ Tis true , ” said he , “ the fellow 's quite a brute —</l>
     <l n="197">A very beast ; but yet , with all his sin ,</l>
     <l n="198">He has a manner — let the devil in . ”</l>
     <l n="199">They half complied , they gave the wish 'd retreat ,</l>
     <l n="200">But raised a worthier to the vacant seat . 200</l>
     <l n="201">Thus forced on ways unlike each former way ,</l>
     <l n="202">Thus led to prayer without a heart to pray ,</l>
     <l n="203">He quits the gay and rich , the young and free ,</l>
     <l n="204">Among the badge-men with a badge to be .</l>
     <l n="205">He sees an humble tradesman raised to rule</l>
     <l n="206">The grey-beard pupils of this moral school ;</l>
     <l n="207">Where he himself , an old licentious boy ,</l>
     <l n="208">Will nothing learn , and nothing can enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="209">In temp'rate measures he must eat and drink ,</l>
     <l n="210">And , pain of pains ! must live alone and think . 210</l>
     <l n="211">In vain , by fortune 's smiles , thrice affluent made ,</l>
     <l n="212">Still has he debts of ancient date unpaid ;</l>
     <l n="213">Thrice into penury by error thrown ,</l>
     <l n="214">Not one right maxim has he made his own ;</l>
     <l n="215">The old men shun him — some his vices hate ,</l>
     <l n="216">And all abhor his principles and prate ;</l>
     <l n="217">Nor love nor care for him will mortal show ,</l>
     <l n="218">Save a frail sister in the female row .</l>

     <l n="1">We had a sprightly nymph — in every town</l>
     <l n="2">Are some such sprights , who wander up and down ;</l>
     <l n="3">She had her useful arts , and could contrive ,</l>
     <l n="4">In time 's despite , to stay at twenty-five ;—</l>
     <l n="5">“ Here will I rest ; move on , thou lying year ,</l>
     <l n="6">This is mine age , and I will rest me here . ”</l>
     <l n="7">Arch was her look , and she had pleasant ways</l>
     <l n="8">Your good opinion of her heart to raise ;</l>
     <l n="9">Her speech was lively , and with ease express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">And well she judged the tempers she address 'd : 10</l>
     <l n="11">If some soft stripling had her keenness felt ,</l>
     <l n="12">She knew the way to make his anger melt ;</l>
     <l n="13">Wit was allow 'd her , though but few could bring</l>
     <l n="14">Direct example of a witty thing ;</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Twas that gay , pleasant , smart , engaging speech ,</l>
     <l n="16">Her beaux admired , and just within their reach ;</l>
     <l n="17">Not indiscreet , perhaps , but yet more free</l>
     <l n="18">Than prudish nymphs allow their wit to be .</l>
     <l n="19">Novels and plays , with poems , old and new ,</l>
     <l n="20">Were all the books our nymph attended to ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Yet from the press no treatise issued forth ,</l>
     <l n="22">But she would speak precisely of its worth .</l>
     <l n="23">She with the London stage familiar grew ,</l>
     <l n="24">And every actor 's name and merit knew ;</l>
     <l n="25">She told how this or that their part mistook ,</l>
     <l n="26">And of the rival Romeos gave the look ;</l>
     <l n="27">Of either house ‘ twas hers the strength to see ,</l>
     <l n="28">Then judge with candour — “ Drury-Lane for me . ”</l>
     <l n="29">What made this knowledge , what this skill complete ?</l>
     <l n="30">A fortnight 's visit in Whitechapel-street . 30</l>
     <l n="31">Her place in life was rich and poor between ,</l>
     <l n="32">With those a favourite , and with these a queen ;</l>
     <l n="33">She could her parts assume , and condescend</l>
     <l n="34">To friends more humble while an humble friend ;</l>
     <l n="35">And thus a welcome , lively guest could pass ,</l>
     <l n="36">Threading her pleasant way from class to class .</l>
     <l n="37">“ Her reputation ? ” — That was like her wit ,</l>
     <l n="38">And seem 'd her manner and her state to fit ;</l>
     <l n="39">Something there was — what , none presumed to say :</l>
     <l n="40">Clouds lightly passing on a smiling day — 40</l>
     <l n="41">Whispers and hints which went from ear to ear ,</l>
     <l n="42">And mix 'd reports no judge on earth could clear .</l>
     <l n="43">But of each sex a friendly number press 'd</l>
     <l n="44">To joyous banquets this alluring guest .</l>
     <l n="45">There , if , indulging mirth and freed from awe ,</l>
     <l n="46">If , pleasing all and pleased with all she saw ,</l>
     <l n="47">Her speech were free , and such as freely dwelt</l>
     <l n="48">On the same feelings all around her felt ;</l>
     <l n="49">Or if some fond presuming favourite tried</l>
     <l n="50">To come so near as once to be denied ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Yet not with brow so stern or speech so nice ,</l>
     <l n="52">But that he ventured on denial twice :—</l>
     <l n="53">If these have been , and so has scandal taught ,</l>
     <l n="54">Yet malice never found the proof she sought .</l>
     <l n="55">But then came one , the Lovelace of his day ,</l>
     <l n="56">Rich , proud , and crafty , handsome , brave , and gay ;</l>
     <l n="57">Yet loved he not those labour 'd plans and arts ,</l>
     <l n="58">But left the business to the ladies ’ hearts ,</l>
     <l n="59">And , when he found them in a proper train ,</l>
     <l n="60">He thought all else superfluous and vain . 60</l>
     <l n="61">But in that training he was deeply taught ,</l>
     <l n="62">And rarely fail 'd of gaining all he sought ;</l>
     <l n="63">He knew how far directly on to go ;</l>
     <l n="64">How to recede and dally to and fro ;</l>
     <l n="65">How to make all the passions his allies , }</l>
     <l n="66">And , when he saw them in contention rise , }</l>
     <l n="67">To watch the wrought-up heart , and conquer by surprise . }</l>
     <l n="68">Our heroine fear 'd him not ; it was her part ,</l>
     <l n="69">To make sure conquest of such gentle heart —</l>
     <l n="70">Of one so mild and humble ; for she saw 70</l>
     <l n="71">In Henry 's eye a love chastised by awe .</l>
     <l n="72">Her thoughts of virtue were not all sublime ,</l>
     <l n="73">Nor virtuous all her thoughts ; ‘ twas now her time</l>
     <l n="74">To bait each hook , in every way to please ,</l>
     <l n="75">And the rich prize with dext'rous hand to seize .</l>
     <l n="76">She had no virgin-terrors ; she could stray</l>
     <l n="77">In all love 's maze , nor fear to lose her way ;</l>
     <l n="78">Nay , could go near the precipice , nor dread</l>
     <l n="79">A failing caution or a giddy head ;</l>
     <l n="80">She 'd fix her eyes upon the roaring flood , 80</l>
     <l n="81">And dance upon the brink where danger stood .</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Twas nature all , she judged , in one so young ,</l>
     <l n="83">To drop the eye and falter in the tongue ;</l>
     <l n="84">To be about to take , and then command</l>
     <l n="85">His daring wish , and only view the hand :</l>
     <l n="86">Yes ! all was nature ; it became a maid</l>
     <l n="87">Of gentle soul t ’ encourage love afraid .—</l>
     <l n="88">He , so unlike the confident and bold ,</l>
     <l n="89">Would fly in mute despair to find her cold :</l>
     <l n="90">The young and tender germ requires the sun 90</l>
     <l n="91">To make it spread ; it must be smiled upon .</l>
     <l n="92">Thus the kind virgin gentle means devised</l>
     <l n="93">To gain a heart so fond , a hand so prized ;</l>
     <l n="94">More gentle still she grew ; to change her way</l>
     <l n="95">Would cause confusion , danger and delay :</l>
     <l n="96">Thus , ( an increase of gentleness her mode ,)</l>
     <l n="97">She took a plain , unvaried , certain road ,</l>
     <l n="98">And every hour believed success was near ,</l>
     <l n="99">Till there was nothing left to hope or fear .</l>
     <l n="100">It must be own 'd that in this strife of hearts , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Man has advantage — has superior arts .</l>
     <l n="102">The lover 's aim is to the nymph unknown ,</l>
     <l n="103">Nor is she always certain of her own ;</l>
     <l n="104">Or has her fears , nor these can so disguise , }</l>
     <l n="105">But he who searches , reads them in her eyes , }</l>
     <l n="106">In the avenging frown , in the regretting sighs : }</l>
     <l n="107">These are his signals , and he learns to steer</l>
     <l n="108">The straighter course whenever they appear .</l>

     <l n="214">The darkest deeds no indignation raise ,</l>
     <l n="215">The purest virtue never wins their praise ;</l>

     <l n="1">See yonder badgeman , with that glowing face ,</l>
     <l n="2">A meteor shining in this sober place !</l>
     <l n="3">Vast sums were paid , and many years were past ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ere gems so rich around their radiance cast !</l>
     <l n="5">Such was the fiery front that Bardolph wore ,</l>

     <l n="12">By jovial sets , and ( as he thought ) beloved ,</l>

     <l n="19">The reasoning few , who neither scorn 'd nor loved ,</l>
     <l n="20">His feelings pitied and his faults reproved . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Benbow , the father , left possessions fair ,</l>

     <l n="32">Known but in drink — he found an easy friend ,</l>

     <l n="37">Care and contention of a busy life ;—</l>
     <l n="38">Worthy , and why ?— that o'er the midnight bowl</l>
     <l n="39">He made his friend the partner of his soul ,</l>
     <l n="40">And any man his friend ;— then thus in glee , 40</l>

     <l n="48">But when the gas from the balloon is gone ,</l>
     <l n="49">When sober thoughts and serious cares come on ,</l>
     <l n="50">Where then the worth that in himself he found ?— 50</l>
     <l n="51">Vanish 'd — and he sank grov'ling on the ground .</l>

     <l n="55">Seated with some grey beadsman , he regrets</l>
     <l n="56">His former feasting , though it swell 'd his debts ;</l>
     <l n="57">Topers once famed , his friends in earlier days ,</l>
     <l n="58">Well he describes , and thinks description praise :</l>
     <l n="59">Each hero 's worth with much delight he paints ;</l>

     <l n="68">That all his tenants and his tradesmen drank ;</l>
     <l n="69">He was delighted from his favourite room</l>
     <l n="70">To see them ‘ cross the park go daily home , 70</l>
     <l n="71">Praising aloud the liquor and the host ,</l>
     <l n="72">And striving who should venerate him most .</l>

     <l n="74">Between the master 's and the servants ’ hall ; }</l>
     <l n="75">And here or there the guests were welcome all . }</l>
     <l n="76">Of Heaven 's free gifts he took no special care ;</l>
     <l n="77">He never quarrel 'd for a simple hare ;</l>
     <l n="78">But sought , by giving sport , a sportsman 's name ,</l>
     <l n="79">Himself a poacher , though at other game .</l>
     <l n="80">He never planted nor inclosed — his trees 80</l>
     <l n="81">Grew like himself , untroubled and at ease ;</l>
     <l n="82">Bounds of all kinds he hated , and had felt</l>
     <l n="83">Choked and imprison 'd in a modern belt ,</l>
     <l n="84">Which some rare genius now has twined about</l>
     <l n="85">The good old house , to keep old neighbours out ;</l>
     <l n="86">Along his valleys , in the evening hours ,</l>
     <l n="87">The borough-damsels stray 'd to gather flowers ,</l>
     <l n="88">Or by the brakes and brushwood of the park ,</l>
     <l n="89">To take their pleasant rambles in the dark .</l>
     <l n="90">“ Some prudes , of rigid kind , forbore to call 90</l>
     <l n="91">On the kind females — favourites at the hall ;</l>
     <l n="92">But better natures saw , with much delight ,</l>
     <l n="93">The different orders of mankind unite ;</l>
     <l n="94">‘ Twas schooling pride to see the footman wait ,</l>
     <l n="95">Smile on his sister and receive her plate .</l>
     <l n="96">“ His worship ever was a churchman true ,</l>
     <l n="97">He held in scorn the methodistic crew ;</l>
     <l n="98">‘ May God defend the Church , and save the King , ’</l>
     <l n="99">He 'd pray devoutly and divinely sing .</l>
     <l n="100">Admit that he the holy day would spend 100</l>
     <l n="101">As priests approved not — still he was a friend .</l>
     <l n="102">Much then I blame the preacher , as too nice ,</l>
     <l n="103">To call such trifles by the name of vice ,</l>
     <l n="104">Hinting , though gently and with cautious speech ,</l>
     <l n="105">Of good example — ‘ tis their trade to preach ;</l>
     <l n="106">But still ‘ twas pity , when the worthy ‘ squire</l>
     <l n="107">Stuck to the church : what more could they require ?</l>
     <l n="108">‘ Twas almost joining that fanatic crew ,</l>
     <l n="109">To throw such morals at his honour 's pew ;</l>
     <l n="110">A weaker man , had he been so reviled , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Had left the place — he only swore and smiled .</l>
     <l n="112">“ But think , ye rectors and ye curates , think ,</l>
     <l n="113">Who are your friends , and at their frailties wink ;</l>
     <l n="114">Conceive not — mounted on your Sunday-throne ,</l>
     <l n="115">Your fire-brands fall upon your foes alone ;</l>
     <l n="116">They strike your patrons — and , should all withdraw</l>
     <l n="117">In whom your wisdoms may discern a flaw ,</l>
     <l n="118">You would the flower of all your audience lose ,</l>
     <l n="119">And spend your crackers on their empty pews ,</l>
     <l n="120">“ The father dead , the son has found a wife , 120</l>
     <l n="121">And lives a formal , proud , unsocial life ;—</l>
     <l n="122">The lands are now enclosed ; the tenants all ,</l>
     <l n="123">Save at a rent-day , never see the hall ;</l>
     <l n="124">No lass is suffer 'd o'er the walks to come ,</l>
     <l n="125">And , if there 's love , they have it all at home .</l>
     <l n="126">“ Oh ! could the ghost of our good ‘ squire arise ,</l>
     <l n="127">And see such change , would it believe its eyes ?</l>
     <l n="128">Would it not glide about from place to place ,</l>
     <l n="129">And mourn the manners of a feebler race ?</l>
     <l n="130">At that long table , where the servants found 130</l>
     <l n="131">Mirth and abundance while the year went round ;</l>
     <l n="132">Where a huge pollard on the winter-fire</l>
     <l n="133">At a huge distance made them all retire ;</l>
     <l n="134">Where not a measure in the room was kept ,</l>
     <l n="135">And but one rule — they tippled till they slept :</l>
     <l n="136">There would it see a pale old hag preside ,</l>
     <l n="137">A thing made up of stinginess and pride ;</l>
     <l n="138">Who carves the meat , as if the flesh could feel ,</l>
     <l n="139">Careless whose flesh must miss the plenteous meal .</l>
     <l n="140">Here would the ghost a small coal-fire behold , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Not fit to keep one body from the cold ;</l>
     <l n="142">Then would it flit to higher rooms , and stay</l>
     <l n="143">To view a dull , dress 'd company at play ;</l>
     <l n="144">All the old comfort , all the genial fare</l>
     <l n="145">For ever gone ! how sternly would it stare ;</l>
     <l n="146">And , though it might not to their view appear ,</l>
     <l n="147">‘ Twould cause among them lassitude and fear ;</l>
     <l n="148">Then wait to see — where he delight has seen —</l>
     <l n="149">The dire effect of fretfulness and spleen .</l>
     <l n="150">“ Such were the worthies of these better days ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">We had their blessings — they shall have our praise .—</l>
     <l n="152">“ Of Captain Dowling would you hear me speak ?</l>
     <l n="153">I 'd sit and sing his praises for a week :</l>
     <l n="154">He was a man , and man-like all his joy ,—</l>
     <l n="155">I 'm led to question , was he ever boy ?</l>
     <l n="156">Beef was his breakfast ;— if from sea and salt ,</l>
     <l n="157">It relish 'd better with his wine of malt ;</l>
     <l n="158">Then , till he dined , if walking in or out ,</l>
     <l n="159">Whether the gravel teased him or the gout ,</l>
     <l n="160">Though short in wind and flannel 'd every limb , 160</l>
     <l n="161">He drank with all who had concerns with him :</l>
     <l n="162">Whatever trader , agent , merchant , came ,</l>
     <l n="163">They found him ready , every hour the same ;</l>
     <l n="164">Whatever liquors might between them pass ,</l>
     <l n="165">He took them all , and never balk 'd his glass ;</l>
     <l n="166">Nay , with the seamen working in the ship ,</l>
     <l n="167">At their request , he 'd share the grog and flip .</l>
     <l n="168">But in the club-room was his chief delight ,</l>
     <l n="169">And punch the favourite liquor of the night ;</l>
     <l n="170">Man after man they from the trial shrank , 170</l>
     <l n="171">And Dowling ever was the last who drank .</l>
     <l n="172">Arrived at home , he , ere he sought his bed ,</l>
     <l n="173">With pipe and brandy would compose his head ;</l>
     <l n="174">Then half an hour was o'er the news beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="175">When he retired as harmless as a child .</l>
     <l n="176">Set but aside the gravel and the gout ,</l>
     <l n="177">And breathing short — his sand ran fairly out .</l>
     <l n="178">“ At fifty-five we lost him — after that</l>
     <l n="179">Life grows insipid and its pleasures flat ;</l>
     <l n="180">He had indulged in all that man can have , 180</l>
     <l n="181">He did not drop a dotard to his grave ;</l>
     <l n="182">Still to the last , his feet upon the chair ,</l>
     <l n="183">With rattling lungs now gone beyond repair ;</l>
     <l n="184">When on each feature death had fix 'd his stamp ,</l>
     <l n="185">And not a doctor could the body vamp ;</l>
     <l n="186">Still at the last , to his beloved bowl</l>
     <l n="187">He clung , and cheer 'd the sadness of his soul ;</l>
     <l n="188">For , though a man may not have much to fear ,</l>
     <l n="189">Yet death looks ugly , when the view is near .</l>
     <l n="190">— ‘ I go , ’ he said , ‘ but still my friends shall say , 190</l>
     <l n="191">‘ Twas as a man — I did not sneak away ;</l>
     <l n="192">An honest life with worthy souls I 've spent —</l>
     <l n="193">Come , fill my glass ; ’ — he took it , and he went .—</l>
     <l n="194">“ Poor Dolly Murrey !— I might live to see</l>
     <l n="195">My hundredth year , but no such lass as she .</l>
     <l n="196">Easy by nature , in her humour gay ,</l>
     <l n="197">She chose her comforts , ratafia and play :</l>
     <l n="198">She loved the social game , the decent glass ;</l>
     <l n="199">And was a jovial , friendly , laughing lass .</l>
     <l n="200">We sat not then at Whist demure and still , 200</l>
     <l n="201">But pass 'd the pleasant hours at gay Quadrille ;</l>
     <l n="202">Lame in her side , we placed her in her seat ,</l>
     <l n="203">Her hands were free , she cared not for her feet ;</l>
     <l n="204">As the game ended , came the glass around ,</l>
     <l n="205">( So was the loser cheer 'd , the winner crown 'd . )</l>
     <l n="206">Mistress of secrets , both the young and old</l>
     <l n="207">In her confided — not a tale she told ;</l>
     <l n="208">Love never made impression on her mind ,</l>
     <l n="209">She held him weak , and all his captives blind ;</l>
     <l n="210">She suffered no man her free soul to vex , 210</l>
     <l n="211">Free from the weakness of her gentle sex ;</l>
     <l n="212">One with whom ours unmoved conversing sate ,</l>
     <l n="213">In cool discussion or in free debate .</l>
     <l n="214">“ Once in her chair we 'd placed the good old lass ,</l>
     <l n="215">Where first she took her preparation glass ;</l>
     <l n="216">By lucky thought she 'd been that day at prayers ,</l>
     <l n="217">And long before had fix 'd her small affairs ;</l>
     <l n="218">So all was easy — on her cards she cast</l>
     <l n="219">A smiling look ; I saw the thought that pass 'd :</l>
     <l n="220">‘ A king , ’ she call 'd ;— though conscious of her skill , 220</l>
     <l n="221">‘ Do more , ’ I answer 'd — ‘ More ? ’ she said ; ‘ I will ; ’</l>
     <l n="222">And more she did — cards answer 'd to her call ,</l>
     <l n="223">She saw the mighty to her mightier fall :</l>
     <l n="224">‘ A vole ! a vole ! ’ she cried , ‘'tis fairly won ,</l>
     <l n="225">My game is ended and my work is done . ’ —</l>
     <l n="226">This said , she gently , with a single sigh ,</l>
     <l n="227">Died as one taught and practised how to die .</l>
     <l n="228">“ Such were the dead-departed ; I survive ,</l>
     <l n="229">To breathe in pain among the dead-alive . ”</l>
     <l n="230">The bell then call 'd these ancient men to pray ; 230 }</l>
     <l n="231">“ Again ! ” said Benbow — “ tolls it every day ? }</l>
     <l n="232">Where is the life I led ? ” — He sigh 'd , and walk 'd his way . }</l>

    <head>THE HOSPITAL AND GOVERNORS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">An ardent spirit dwells with Christian love ,</l>
     <l n="2">The eagle 's vigour in the pitying dove ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis not enough that we with sorrow sigh ,</l>
     <l n="4">That we the wants of pleading man supply ;</l>
     <l n="5">That we in sympathy with sufferers feel ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nor hear a grief without a wish to heal .</l>
     <l n="7">Not these suffice — to sickness , pain , and wo ,</l>
     <l n="8">The Christian spirit loves with aid to go ;</l>
     <l n="9">Will not be sought , waits not for want to plead ,</l>
     <l n="10">But seeks the duty — nay , prevents the need ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Her utmost aid to every ill applies ,</l>
     <l n="12">And plans relief for coming miseries .</l>
     <l n="13">Hence yonder building rose : on either side</l>
     <l n="14">Far stretch 'd the wards , all airy , warm , and wide ;</l>
     <l n="15">And every ward has beds by comfort spread ,</l>
     <l n="16">And smooth 'd for him who suffers on the bed .</l>
     <l n="17">There have all kindness , most relief — for some</l>
     <l n="18">Is cure complete — it is the sufferer 's home :</l>
     <l n="19">Fevers and chronic ills , corroding pains ,</l>
     <l n="20">Each accidental mischief man sustains ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Fractures and wounds , and wither 'd limbs and lame ,</l>
     <l n="22">With all that , slow or sudden , vex our frame ,</l>
     <l n="23">Have here attendance — here the sufferers lie }</l>
     <l n="24">( Where love and science every aid apply ) , }</l>
     <l n="25">And heal 'd with rapture live , or soothed by comfort die . }</l>
     <l n="26">See one relieved from anguish , and to-day</l>
     <l n="27">Allow 'd to walk and look an hour away ;</l>
     <l n="28">Two months confined by fever , frenzy , pain ,</l>
     <l n="29">He comes abroad and is himself again :</l>
     <l n="30">‘ Twas in the spring , when carried to the place , 30</l>
     <l n="31">The snow fell down and melted in his face .</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Tis summer now ; all objects gay and new ;</l>
     <l n="33">Smiling alike the viewer and the view :</l>
     <l n="34">He stops as one unwilling to advance ,</l>
     <l n="35">Without another and another glance ;</l>
     <l n="36">With what a pure and simple joy he sees</l>
     <l n="37">Those sheep and cattle browzing at their ease ;</l>
     <l n="38">Easy himself , there 's nothing breathes or moves</l>
     <l n="39">But he would cherish — all that lives he loves :</l>
     <l n="40">Observing every ward as round he goes , 40</l>
     <l n="41">He thinks what pain , what danger they enclose ;</l>
     <l n="42">Warm in his wish for all who suffer there ,</l>
     <l n="43">At every view he meditates a prayer :</l>
     <l n="44">No evil counsels in his breast abide ,</l>
     <l n="45">There joy , and love , and gratitude reside .</l>
     <l n="46">The wish that Roman necks in one were found ,</l>
     <l n="47">That he who form 'd the wish might deal the wound ,</l>
     <l n="48">This man had never heard ; but of the kind ,</l>
     <l n="49">Is that desire which rises in his mind ;</l>
     <l n="50">He 'd have all English hands ( for further he 50</l>
     <l n="51">Cannot conceive extends our charity ) ,</l>
     <l n="52">All but his own , in one right-hand to grow ,</l>
     <l n="53">And then what hearty shake would he bestow !</l>
     <l n="54">“ How rose the building ? ” — Piety first laid</l>
     <l n="55">A strong foundation , but she wanted aid ;</l>
     <l n="56">To Wealth unwieldy was her prayer address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="57">Who largely gave , and she the donor bless 'd .</l>
     <l n="58">Unwieldy Wealth then to his couch withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="59">And took the sweetest sleep he ever knew .</l>
     <l n="60">Then busy Vanity sustain 'd her part , 60</l>
     <l n="61">“ And much , ” she said , “ it moved her tender heart ;</l>
     <l n="62">To her all kinds of man 's distress were known ,</l>
     <l n="63">And all her heart adopted as its own . ”</l>
     <l n="64">Then Science came — his talents he display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="65">And Charity with joy the dome survey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="66">Skill , Wealth , and Vanity , obtain the fame ,</l>
     <l n="67">And Piety , the joy that makes no claim .</l>
     <l n="68">Patrons there are , and governors , from whom</l>
     <l n="69">The greater aid and guiding orders come ;</l>
     <l n="70">Who voluntary cares and labours take , 70</l>
     <l n="71">The sufferers ’ servants for the service ’ sake .</l>
     <l n="72">Of these a part I give you — but a part —</l>
     <l n="73">Some hearts are hidden ; some have not a heart .</l>
     <l n="74">First let me praise — for so I best shall paint —</l>
     <l n="75">That pious moralist , that reasoning saint !</l>
     <l n="76">Can I of worth like thine , Eusebius , speak ?</l>
     <l n="77">The man is willing , but the muse is weak ;—</l>
     <l n="78">‘ Tis thine to wait on wo ! to soothe ! to heal !</l>
     <l n="79">With learning social , and polite with zeal :</l>
     <l n="80">In thy pure breast although the passions dwell , 80</l>
     <l n="81">They 're train 'd by virtue and no more rebel ;</l>
     <l n="82">But have so long been active on her side ,</l>
     <l n="83">That passion now might be itself the guide .</l>
     <l n="84">Law , conscience , honour , all obey 'd ; all give</l>
     <l n="85">Th ’ approving voice , and make it bliss to live ;</l>
     <l n="86">While faith , when life can nothing more supply ,</l>
     <l n="87">Shall strengthen hope , and make it bliss to die .</l>
     <l n="88">He preaches , speaks and writes with manly sense —</l>
     <l n="89">No weak neglect , no laboured eloquence ;</l>
     <l n="90">Goodness and wisdom are in all his ways , 90</l>
     <l n="91">The rude revere him and the wicked praise .</l>
     <l n="92">Upon humility his virtues grow ,</l>
     <l n="93">And tower so high because so fix 'd below ;</l>
     <l n="94">As wider spreads the oak his boughs around ,</l>
     <l n="95">When deeper with his roots he digs the solid ground .</l>
     <l n="96">By him , from ward to ward , is every aid</l>
     <l n="97">The sufferer needs with every care convey 'd .</l>
     <l n="98">Like the good tree he brings his treasure forth ,</l>
     <l n="99">And , like the tree , unconscious of his worth ;</l>
     <l n="100">Meek as the poorest Publican is he , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And strict as lives the straitest Pharisee ;</l>
     <l n="102">Of both , in him unite the better part —</l>
     <l n="103">The blameless conduct and the humble heart .</l>
     <l n="104">Yet he escapes not ; he , with some , is wise</l>
     <l n="105">In carnal things , and loves to moralize ;</l>
     <l n="106">Others can doubt , if all that Christian care</l>
     <l n="107">Has not its price — there 's something he may share .</l>
     <l n="108">But this , and ill severer , he sustains ,</l>
     <l n="109">As gold the fire , and as unhurt remains ;</l>
     <l n="110">When most reviled , although he feels the smart , 110</l>
     <l n="111">It wakes to nobler deeds the wounded heart ,</l>
     <l n="112">As the rich olive , beaten for its fruit ,</l>
     <l n="113">Puts forth at every bruise a bearing shoot .</l>
     <l n="114">A second friend we have , whose care and zeal</l>
     <l n="115">But few can equal — few indeed can feel .</l>
     <l n="116">He lived a life obscure , and profits made</l>
     <l n="117">In the coarse habits of a vulgar trade .</l>
     <l n="118">His brother , master of a hoy , he loved</l>
     <l n="119">So well , that he the calling disapproved :</l>
     <l n="120">“ Alas ! poor Tom ! ” the landman oft would sigh , 120</l>
     <l n="121">When the gale freshen 'd and the waves ran high ;</l>
     <l n="122">And when they parted , with a tear he 'd say ,</l>
     <l n="123">“ No more adventure !— here in safety stay . ”</l>
     <l n="124">Nor did he feign ; with more than half he had ,</l>
     <l n="125">He would have kept the seaman , and been glad .</l>
     <l n="126">Alas ! how few resist , when strongly tried !—</l>
     <l n="127">A rich relation 's nearer kinsman died ;</l>
     <l n="128">He sicken 'd , and to him the landman went ,</l>
     <l n="129">And all his hours with cousin Ephraim spent .</l>
     <l n="130">This Thomas heard , and cared not : “ I , ” quoth he , 130</l>
     <l n="131">“ Have one in port upon the watch for me . ”</l>
     <l n="132">So Ephraim died , and , when the will was shown ,</l>
     <l n="133">Isaac , the landman , had the whole his own :</l>
     <l n="134">Who to his brother sent a moderate purse ,</l>
     <l n="135">Which he return 'd , in anger , with his curse ;</l>
     <l n="136">Then went to sea , and made his grog so strong ,</l>
     <l n="137">He died before he could forgive the wrong .</l>
     <l n="138">The rich man built a house , both large and high ,</l>
     <l n="139">He enter 'd in and set him down to sigh ;</l>
     <l n="140">He planted ample woods and gardens fair , 140</l>
     <l n="141">And walk 'd with anguish and compunction there :</l>
     <l n="142">The rich man 's pines , to every friend a treat ,</l>
     <l n="143">He saw with pain , and he refused to eat ;</l>
     <l n="144">His daintiest food , his richest wines , were all</l>
     <l n="145">Turn 'd by remorse to vinegar and gall :</l>
     <l n="146">The softest down , by living body press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="147">The rich man bought , and tried to take his rest ;</l>
     <l n="148">But care had thorns upon his pillow spread ,</l>
     <l n="149">And scatter 'd sand and nettles in his bed .</l>
     <l n="150">Nervous he grew — would often sigh and groan , 150</l>
     <l n="151">He talk 'd but little , and he walk 'd alone ;</l>
     <l n="152">Till by his priest convinced , that from one deed</l>
     <l n="153">Of genuine love would joy and health proceed ;</l>
     <l n="154">He from that time with care and zeal began</l>
     <l n="155">To seek and soothe the grievous ills of man ;</l>
     <l n="156">And , as his hands their aid to grief apply ,</l>
     <l n="157">He learns to smile and he forgets to sigh .</l>
     <l n="158">Now he can drink his wine and taste his food .</l>
     <l n="159">And feel the blessings Heav'n has dealt are good ;</l>
     <l n="160">And , since the suffering seek the rich man 's door , 160</l>
     <l n="161">He sleeps as soundly as when young and poor .</l>
     <l n="162">Here much he gives — is urgent more to gain ;</l>
     <l n="163">He begs — rich beggars seldom sue in vain ;</l>
     <l n="164">Preachers most famed he moves , the crowd to move ,</l>
     <l n="165">And never wearies in the work of love ;</l>
     <l n="166">He rules all business , settles all affairs ,</l>
     <l n="167">He makes collections , he directs repairs ;</l>
     <l n="168">And if he wrong 'd one brother — Heav'n forgive</l>
     <l n="169">The man by whom so many brethren live !</l>

     <l n="170">Then , ‘ mid our signatures , a name appears 170</l>
     <l n="171">Of one for wisdom famed above his years ;</l>
     <l n="172">And these were forty : he was from his youth</l>
     <l n="173">A patient searcher after useful truth :</l>
     <l n="174">To language little of his time he gave ,</l>
     <l n="175">To science less , nor was the muse 's slave ;</l>
     <l n="176">Sober and grave , his college sent him down ,</l>
     <l n="177">A fair example for his native town .</l>
     <l n="178">Slowly he speaks , and with such solemn air ,</l>
     <l n="179">You 'd think a Socrates or Solon there ,</l>
     <l n="180">For though a Christian , he 's disposed to draw 180</l>
     <l n="181">His rules from reason 's and from nature 's law .</l>
     <l n="182">“ Know , ” he exclaims , “ my fellow mortals , know ,</l>
     <l n="183">Virtue alone is happiness below ;</l>
     <l n="184">And what is virtue ? Prudence , first to choose</l>
     <l n="185">Life 's real good — the evil to refuse ;</l>
     <l n="186">Add justice then , the eager hand to hold ,</l>
     <l n="187">To curb the lust of power and thirst of gold ;</l>
     <l n="188">Join temp'rance next , that cheerful health insures ,</l>
     <l n="189">And fortitude unmoved , that conquers or endures . ”</l>
     <l n="190">He speaks , and lo !— the very man you see : 190</l>
     <l n="191">Prudent and temperate , just and patient he ;</l>
     <l n="192">By prudence taught his worldly wealth to keep ,</l>
     <l n="193">No folly wastes , no avarice swells the heap :</l>
     <l n="194">He no man 's debtor , no man 's patron lives ;</l>
     <l n="195">Save sound advice , he neither asks nor gives ;</l>
     <l n="196">By no vain thoughts or erring fancy sway 'd ,</l>
     <l n="197">His words are weighty , or at least are weigh 'd ;</l>
     <l n="198">Temp'rate in every place — abroad , at home ,</l>
     <l n="199">Thence will applause , and hence will profit come ;</l>
     <l n="200">And health from either he in time prepares 200</l>
     <l n="201">For sickness , age , and their attendant cares ,</l>
     <l n="202">But not for fancy 's ills ;— he never grieves</l>
     <l n="203">For love that wounds or friendship that deceives ;</l>
     <l n="204">His patient soul endures what Heav'n ordains ,</l>
     <l n="205">But neither feels nor fears ideal pains .</l>
     <l n="206">“ Is aught then wanted in a man so wise ? ” —</l>
     <l n="207">Alas !— I think he wants infirmities ;</l>
     <l n="208">He wants the ties that knit us to our kind —</l>
     <l n="209">The cheerful , tender , soft , complacent mind ,</l>
     <l n="210">That would the feelings , which he dreads , excite , 210</l>
     <l n="211">And make the virtues he approves delight ;</l>
     <l n="212">What dying martyrs , saints , and patriots feel —</l>
     <l n="213">The strength of action and the warmth of zeal .</l>
     <l n="214">Again attend !— and see a man whose cares</l>
     <l n="215">Are nicely placed on either world 's affairs .—</l>
     <l n="216">Merchant and saint , ‘ tis doubtful if he knows</l>
     <l n="217">To which account he most regard bestows ;</l>
     <l n="218">Of both he keeps his ledger :— there he reads</l>
     <l n="219">Of gainful ventures and of godly deeds ;</l>
     <l n="220">There all he gets or loses find a place — 220</l>
     <l n="221">A lucky bargain and a lack of grace .</l>
     <l n="222">The joys above this prudent man invite</l>
     <l n="223">To pay his tax — devotion !— day and night ;</l>
     <l n="224">The pains of hell his timid bosom awe ,</l>
     <l n="225">And force obedience to the church 's law :</l>
     <l n="226">Hence that continual thought , that solemn air ,</l>
     <l n="227">Those sad good works , and that laborious prayer .</l>
     <l n="228">All these ( when conscience , waken 'd and afraid</l>
     <l n="229">To think how avarice calls and is obey 'd )</l>
     <l n="230">He in his journal finds , and for his grief 230</l>
     <l n="231">Obtains the transient opium of relief .</l>
     <l n="232">“ Sink not , my soul !— my spirit , rise and look</l>
     <l n="233">O'er the fair entries of this precious book :</l>
     <l n="234">Here are the sins , our debts ;— this fairer side</l>
     <l n="235">Has what to carnal wish our strength denied ;</l>
     <l n="236">Has those religious duties every day</l>
     <l n="237">Paid — which so few upon the sabbath pay ;</l>
     <l n="238">Here too are conquests over frail desires ,</l>
     <l n="239">Attendance due on all the church requires ;</l>
     <l n="240">Then alms I give — for I believe the word 240</l>
     <l n="241">Of holy writ , and lend unto the Lord —</l>
     <l n="242">And , if not all th ’ importunate demand ,</l>
     <l n="243">The fear of want restrains my ready hand ;</l>
     <l n="244">— Behold what sums I to the poor resign ,</l>
     <l n="245">Sums placed in Heaven 's own book , as well as mine !</l>
     <l n="246">Rest , then , my spirit !— fastings , prayers , and alms ,</l>
     <l n="247">Will soon suppress these idly-raised alarms ,</l>
     <l n="248">And , weigh 'd against our frailties , set in view</l>
     <l n="249">A noble balance in our favour due .</l>
     <l n="250">Add that I yearly here affix my name , 250</l>
     <l n="251">Pledge for large payment — not from love of fame ,</l>
     <l n="252">But to make peace within ;— that peace to make ,</l>
     <l n="253">What sums I lavish ! and what gains forsake !</l>
     <l n="254">Cheer up , my heart !— let 's cast off every doubt ,</l>
     <l n="255">Pray without dread , and place our money out . ”</l>
     <l n="256">Such the religion of a mind that steers</l>
     <l n="257">Its way to bliss , between its hopes and fears ;</l>
     <l n="258">Whose passions in due bounds each other keep ,</l>
     <l n="259">And , thus subdued , they murmur till they sleep ;</l>
     <l n="260">Whose virtues all their certain limits know , 260</l>
     <l n="261">Like well-dried herbs that neither fade nor grow ;</l>
     <l n="262">Who for success and safety ever tries ,</l>
     <l n="263">And with both worlds alternately complies .</l>
     <l n="264">Such are the guardians of this bless 'd estate ;</l>
     <l n="265">Whate'er without , they 're praised within the gate ;</l>
     <l n="266">That they are men , and have their faults , is true ,</l>
     <l n="267">But here their worth alone appears in view :</l>
     <l n="268">The Muse indeed , who reads the very breast ,</l>
     <l n="269">Has something of the secrets there express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="270">But yet in charity ;— and , when she sees 270</l>
     <l n="271">Such means for joy or comfort , health or ease ,</l>
     <l n="272">And knows how much united minds effect ,</l>
     <l n="273">She almost dreads their failings to detect ;</l>
     <l n="274">But truth commands :— in man 's erroneous kind ,</l>
     <l n="275">Virtues and frailties mingle in the mind ;</l>
     <l n="276">Happy , when fears to public spirit move ,</l>
     <l n="277">And even vices to the work of love !</l>

     <l n="11">At her old house , her dress , her air the same ,</l>

     <l n="13">“ Learning , my child , ” said she , “ shall fame command ;</l>
     <l n="14">Learning is better worth than house or land —</l>
     <l n="15">For houses perish , lands are gone and spent ;</l>

     <l n="18">In every verse throughout one sacred book ;</l>
     <l n="19">From this her joy , her hope , her peace is sought :</l>
     <l n="20">This she has learn 'd , and she is nobly taught . 20</l>

     <l n="26">When first I trembled o'er the gilded book ?</l>
     <l n="27">How she , all patient , both at eve and morn ,</l>
     <l n="28">Her needle pointed at the guarding horn ;</l>
     <l n="29">And how she soothed me , when , with study sad ,</l>
     <l n="30">I labour 'd on to reach the final zad ? 30</l>
     <l n="31">Shall I not grateful still the dame survey ,</l>

     <l n="37">And feel the pleasing debt , and pay the just applause : }</l>
     <l n="38">To her own house is borne the week 's supply ;</l>
     <l n="39">There she in credit lives , there hopes in peace to die .</l>
     <l n="40">With her a harmless idiot we behold , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Who hoards up silver shells for shining gold ;</l>
     <l n="42">These he preserves , with unremitted care ,</l>
     <l n="43">To buy a seat , and reign the Borough 's mayor :</l>
     <l n="44">Alas !— who could th ’ ambitious changeling tell ,</l>
     <l n="45">That what he sought our rulers dared to sell ?</l>
     <l n="46">Near these a sailor in that hut of thatch</l>
     <l n="47">( A fish-boat 's cabin is its nearest match )</l>
     <l n="48">Dwells , and the dungeon is to him a seat ,</l>
     <l n="49">Large as he wishes — in his view complete .</l>
     <l n="50">A lockless coffer and a lidless hutch 50</l>
     <l n="51">That hold his stores , have room for twice as much ;</l>
     <l n="52">His one spare shirt , long glass , and iron box ,</l>
     <l n="53">Lie all in view ; no need has he for locks .</l>
     <l n="54">Here he abides , and , as our strangers pass ,</l>
     <l n="55">He shows the shipping , he presents the glass ;</l>
     <l n="56">He makes ( unask 'd ) their ports and business known ,</l>
     <l n="57">And ( kindly heard ) turns quickly to his own .</l>
     <l n="58">Of noble captains — heroes every one —</l>
     <l n="59">You might as soon have made the steeple run :</l>
     <l n="60">And then his messmates , if you 're pleased to stay , 60</l>
     <l n="61">He 'll one by one the gallant souls display ;</l>
     <l n="62">And as the story verges to an end ,</l>
     <l n="63">He 'll wind from deed to deed , from friend to friend ;</l>
     <l n="64">He 'll speak of those long lost , the brave of old ,</l>
     <l n="65">As princes gen'rous and as heroes bold ;</l>
     <l n="66">Then will his feelings rise , till you may trace</l>
     <l n="67">Gloom , like a cloud , frown o'er his manly face —</l>
     <l n="68">And then a tear or two , which sting his pride ,</l>
     <l n="69">These he will dash indignantly aside ,</l>
     <l n="70">And splice his tale ;— now take him from his cot , 70</l>
     <l n="71">And for some cleaner [ berth ] exchange his lot ,</l>
     <l n="72">How will he all that cruel aid deplore ?</l>
     <l n="73">His heart will break , and he will fight no more .</l>
     <l n="74">Here is the poor old merchant : he declined ,</l>
     <l n="75">And , as they say , is not in perfect mind ;</l>
     <l n="76">In his poor house , with one poor maiden friend ,</l>
     <l n="77">Quiet he paces to his journey 's end .</l>
     <l n="78">Rich in his youth , he traded and he fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="79">Again he tried , again his fate prevail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="80">His spirits low and his exertions small , 80</l>
     <l n="81">He fell perforce , he seem 'd decreed to fall :</l>
     <l n="82">Like the gay knight , unapt to rise was he ,</l>
     <l n="83">But downward sank with sad alacrity .</l>
     <l n="84">A borough-place we gain 'd him — in disgrace</l>
     <l n="85">For gross neglect , he quickly lost the place ;</l>
     <l n="86">But still he kept a kind of sullen pride ,</l>
     <l n="87">Striving his wants to hinder or to hide .</l>
     <l n="88">At length , compell 'd by very need , in grief</l>
     <l n="89">He wrote a proud petition for relief .</l>
     <l n="90">“ He did suppose a fall , like his , would prove 90</l>
     <l n="91">Of force to wake their sympathy and love ;</l>
     <l n="92">Would make them feel the changes all may know ,</l>
     <l n="93">And stir them up a new regard to show . ”</l>
     <l n="94">His suit was granted ;— to an ancient maid ,</l>
     <l n="95">Relieved herself , relief for him was paid .</l>
     <l n="96">Here they together ( meet companions ) dwell ,</l>
     <l n="97">And dismal tales of man 's misfortunes tell :</l>
     <l n="98">“ ‘ Twas not a world for them , God help them ! they</l>
     <l n="99">Could not deceive , nor flatter , nor betray ;</l>
     <l n="100">But there 's a happy change , a scene to come , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And they , God help them ! shall be soon at home . ”</l>
     <l n="102">If these no pleasures nor enjoyments gain , }</l>
     <l n="103">Still none their spirits nor their speech restrain ; }</l>
     <l n="104">They sigh at ease , ‘ mid comforts they complain . }</l>
     <l n="105">The poor will grieve , the poor will weep and sigh ,</l>
     <l n="106">Both when they know , and when they know not why ;</l>
     <l n="107">But we our bounty with such care bestow ,</l>
     <l n="108">That cause for grieving they shall seldom know .</l>
     <l n="109">Your plan I love not ;— with a number you</l>
     <l n="110">Have placed your poor , your pitiable few ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">There , in one house , throughout their lives to be —</l>
     <l n="112">The pauper-palace which they hate to see ;</l>
     <l n="113">That giant-building , that high-bounding wall ,</l>
     <l n="114">Those bare-worn walks , that lofty thund'ring hall !</l>
     <l n="115">That large loud clock , which tolls each dreaded hour ;</l>
     <l n="116">Those gates and locks , and all those signs of power :</l>
     <l n="117">It is a prison , with a milder name ,</l>
     <l n="118">Which few inhabit without dread or shame .</l>
     <l n="119">Be it agreed — the poor who hither come</l>
     <l n="120">Partake of plenty , seldom found at home ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">That airy rooms and decent beds are meant</l>
     <l n="122">To give the poor by day , by night , content ;</l>
     <l n="123">That none are frighten 'd , once admitted here ,</l>
     <l n="124">By the stern looks of lordly overseer ;</l>
     <l n="125">Grant that the guardians of the place attend ,</l>
     <l n="126">And ready ear to each petition lend ;</l>
     <l n="127">That they desire the grieving poor to show</l>
     <l n="128">What ills they feel , what partial acts they know ,</l>
     <l n="129">Not without promise , nay desire to heal</l>
     <l n="130">Each wrong they suffer and each wo they feel .— 130</l>
     <l n="131">Alas ! their sorrows in their bosoms dwell ;</l>
     <l n="132">They 've much to suffer , but have nought to tell ;</l>
     <l n="133">They have no evil in the place to state ,</l>
     <l n="134">And dare not say , it is the house they hate :</l>
     <l n="135">They own , there 's granted all such place can give ,</l>
     <l n="136">But live repining , for ‘ tis there they live .</l>
     <l n="137">Grandsires are there , who now no more must see , }</l>
     <l n="138">No more must nurse upon the trembling knee , }</l>
     <l n="139">The lost loved daughter 's infant progeny : }</l>
     <l n="140">Like death 's dread mansion , this allows not place 140</l>
     <l n="141">For joyful meetings of a kindred race .</l>
     <l n="142">Is not the matron there , to whom the son</l>
     <l n="143">Was wont at each declining day to run ;</l>
     <l n="144">He ( when his toil was over ) gave delight ,</l>
     <l n="145">By lifting up the latch , and one “ good night ” ?</l>
     <l n="146">Yes , she is here ; but nightly to her door</l>
     <l n="147">The son , still lab'ring , can return no more .</l>
     <l n="148">Widows are here , who in their huts were left ,</l>
     <l n="149">Of husbands , children , plenty , ease bereft ;</l>
     <l n="150">Yet all that grief within the humble shed 150</l>
     <l n="151">Was soften 'd , soften 'd in the humble bed ;—</l>
     <l n="152">But here , in all its force , remains the grief ,</l>
     <l n="153">And not one soft'ning object for relief .</l>
     <l n="154">Who can , when here , the social neighbour meet ?</l>
     <l n="155">Who learn the story current in the street ?</l>
     <l n="156">Who to the long-known intimate impart</l>
     <l n="157">Facts they have learn 'd or feelings of the heart ?—</l>
     <l n="158">They talk indeed ; but who can choose a friend ,</l>
     <l n="159">Or seek companions at their journey 's end ?</l>
     <l n="160">Here are not those whom they , when infants , knew ; 160</l>
     <l n="161">Who , with like fortune , up to manhood grew ;</l>
     <l n="162">Who , with like troubles , at old age arrived ;</l>
     <l n="163">Who , like themselves , the joy of life survived ;</l>
     <l n="164">Whom time and custom so familiar made ,</l>
     <l n="165">That looks the meaning in the mind convey 'd :</l>
     <l n="166">But here , to strangers , words nor looks impart</l>
     <l n="167">The various movements of the suffering heart ;</l>
     <l n="168">Nor will that heart with those alliance own ,</l>
     <l n="169">To whom its views and hopes are all unknown .</l>
     <l n="170">What , if no grievous fears their lives annoy , 170</l>
     <l n="171">Is it not worse no prospects to enjoy ?</l>
     <l n="172">‘ Tis cheerless living in such bounded view ,</l>
     <l n="173">With nothing dreadful , but with nothing new ;</l>
     <l n="174">Nothing to bring them joy , to make them weep —</l>
     <l n="175">The day itself is , like the night , asleep ;</l>
     <l n="176">Or , on the sameness if a break be made ,</l>
     <l n="177">‘ Tis by some pauper to his grave convey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="178">By smuggled news from neighb'ring village told ,</l>
     <l n="179">News never true , or truth a twelvemonth old ;</l>
     <l n="180">By some new inmate doom 'd with them to dwell , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Or justice come to see that all goes well ;</l>
     <l n="182">Or change of room , or hour of leave to crawl }</l>
     <l n="183">On the black footway winding with the wall , }</l>
     <l n="184">Till the stern bell forbids , or master 's sterner call . }</l>
     <l n="185">Here too the mother sees her children train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="186">Her voice excluded and her feelings pain 'd .</l>
     <l n="187">Who govern here , by general rules must move ,</l>
     <l n="188">Where ruthless custom rends the bond of love .</l>
     <l n="189">Nations , we know , have nature 's law transgressed .</l>
     <l n="190">And snatch 'd the infant from the parent 's breast ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">But still for public good the boy was train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="192">The mother suffer 'd , but the matron gain 'd :</l>
     <l n="193">Here nature 's outrage serves no cause to aid ;</l>
     <l n="194">The ill is felt , but not the Spartan made .</l>
     <l n="195">Then too , I own , it grieves me to behold</l>
     <l n="196">Those ever virtuous , helpless now and old ,</l>
     <l n="197">By all for care and industry approved ,</l>
     <l n="198">For truth respected , and for temper loved ;</l>
     <l n="199">And who , by sickness and misfortune tried ,</l>
     <l n="200">Gave want its worth and poverty its pride : 200</l>
     <l n="201">I own it grieves me to behold them sent</l>
     <l n="202">From their old home ; ‘ tis pain , ‘ tis punishment ,</l>
     <l n="203">To leave each scene familiar , every face ,</l>
     <l n="204">For a new people and a stranger race ;</l>
     <l n="205">For those who , sunk in sloth and dead to shame ,</l>
     <l n="206">From scenes of guilt with daring spirits came ;</l>
     <l n="207">Men , just and guileless , at such manners start ,</l>
     <l n="208">And bless their God that time has fenced their heart ,</l>
     <l n="209">Confirm 'd their virtue , and expell 'd the fear</l>
     <l n="210">Of vice in minds so simple and sincere . 210</l>
     <l n="211">Here the good pauper , losing all the praise</l>
     <l n="212">By worthy deeds acquired in better days ,</l>
     <l n="213">Breathes a few months ; then , to his chamber led ,</l>
     <l n="214">Expires , while strangers prattle round his bed .</l>
     <l n="215">The grateful hunter , when his horse is old ,</l>
     <l n="216">Wills not the useless favourite to be sold ;</l>
     <l n="217">He knows his former worth , and gives him place</l>
     <l n="218">In some fair pasture , till he runs his race .</l>
     <l n="219">But has the labourer , has the seaman done</l>
     <l n="220">Less worthy service , thought not dealt to one ? 220</l>
     <l n="221">Shall we not , then , contribute to their ease ,</l>
     <l n="222">In their old haunts , where ancient objects please ;</l>
     <l n="223">That , till their sight shall fail them , they may trace</l>
     <l n="224">The well-known prospect and the long-loved face ?</l>
     <l n="225">The noble oak , in distant ages seen ,</l>
     <l n="226">With far-stretch 'd boughs and foliage fresh and green ,</l>
     <l n="227">Though now its bare and forky branches show</l>
     <l n="228">How much it lacks the vital warmth below —</l>
     <l n="229">The stately ruin yet our wonder gains ,</l>
     <l n="230">Nay , moves our pity , without thought of pains ; 230</l>

     <l n="232">Our gentler passions in their cause engage .—</l>
     <l n="233">Drooping and burthen 'd with a weight of years ,</l>

     <l n="235">How worthy pity , love , respect , and grief —</l>
     <l n="236">He claims protection — he compels relief ;—</l>

     <l n="238">The storms abroad , whom we at home might save , }</l>
     <l n="239">And let a stranger dig our ancient brother 's grave ? }</l>
     <l n="240">No !— we will shield him from the storm he fears , 240</l>

   <p>The Parish-Clerk began his Duties with the late Vicar , a grave and austere Man ; one fully orthodox ; a Detecter and Opposer of the Wiles of Satan — His Opinion of his own Fortitude — The more frail offended by these Professions — His good Advice gives further Provocation — They invent Stratagems to overcome his Virtue — His Triumph — He is yet not invulnerable : is assaulted by Fear of Want , and Avarice — He gradually yields to the Seduction — He reasons with himself and is persuaded — He offends , but with Terror ; repeats his Offence ; grows familiar with Crime ; is detected — His Sufferings and Death .</p>

    <head>THE PARISH-CLERK .</head>
     <l n="1">With our late vicar , and his age the same , }</l>
     <l n="2">His clerk , hight Jachin , to his office came : }</l>
     <l n="3">The like slow speech was his , the like tall slender frame . }</l>
     <l n="4">But Jachin was the gravest man on ground ,</l>
     <l n="5">And heard his master 's jokes with look profound ;</l>
     <l n="6">For worldly wealth this man of letters sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="7">And had a sprinkling of the spirit 's pride ;</l>
     <l n="8">But he was sober , chaste , devout , and just ,</l>
     <l n="9">One whom his neighbours could believe and trust :</l>
     <l n="10">Of none suspected , neither man nor maid 10</l>
     <l n="11">By him were wrong 'd , or were of him afraid .</l>
     <l n="12">There was indeed a frown , a trick of state</l>
     <l n="13">In Jachin ;— formal was his air and gait ;</l>
     <l n="14">But if he seem 'd more solemn and less kind</l>
     <l n="15">Than some light men to light affairs confined ,</l>
     <l n="16">Still ‘ twas allow 'd that he should so behave</l>
     <l n="17">As in high seat , and be severely grave .</l>
     <l n="18">This book-taught man to man 's first foe profess 'd</l>
     <l n="19">Defiance stern , and hate that knew not rest ;</l>
     <l n="20">He held that Satan , since the world began , 20</l>
     <l n="21">In every act had strife with every man ;</l>
     <l n="22">That never evil deed on earth was done ,</l>
     <l n="23">But of the acting parties he was one :</l>
     <l n="24">The flattering guide to make ill prospers clear ;</l>
     <l n="25">To smooth rough ways the constant pioneer ;</l>
     <l n="26">The ever-tempting , soothing , softening power ,</l>
     <l n="27">Ready to cheat , seduce , deceive , devour .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Me has the sly seducer oft withstood , ”</l>
     <l n="29">Said pious Jachin ,— “ but he gets no good ;</l>
     <l n="30">I pass the house where swings the tempting sign , 30</l>
     <l n="31">And , pointing , tell him , ‘ Satan , that is thine ; ’</l>
     <l n="32">I pass the damsels pacing down the street ,</l>
     <l n="33">And look more grave and solemn when we meet ;</l>
     <l n="34">Nor doth it irk me to rebuke their smiles ,</l>
     <l n="35">Their wanton ambling and their watchful wiles .</l>
     <l n="36">Nay , like the good John Bunyan , when I view</l>
     <l n="37">Those forms , I 'm angry at the ills they do ;</l>
     <l n="38">That I could pinch and spoil , in sin 's despite ,</l>
     <l n="39">Beauties , which frail and evil thoughts excite<span type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span>!</l>
     <l n="40">“ At feasts and banquets seldom am I found , 40</l>
     <l n="41">And ( save at church ) abhor a tuneful sound ;</l>
     <l n="42">To plays and shows I run not to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="43">And where my master goes forbear to go . ”</l>
     <l n="44">No wonder Satan took the thing amiss ,</l>
     <l n="45">To be opposed by such a man as this —</l>
     <l n="46">A man so grave , important , cautious , wise ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who dared not trust his feeling or his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="48">No wonder he should lurk and lie in wait ,</l>
     <l n="49">Should fit his hooks and ponder on his bait ;</l>
     <l n="50">Should on his movements keep a watchful eye ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">For he pursued a fish who led the fry .</l>
     <l n="52">With his own peace our clerk was not content ;</l>
     <l n="53">He tried , good man ! to make his friends repent .</l>
     <l n="54">“ Nay , nay , my friends , from inns and taverns fly ;</l>
     <l n="55">You may suppress your thirst , but not supply .</l>
     <l n="56">A foolish proverb says , ‘ the devil 's at home ; ’</l>
     <l n="57">But he is there , and tempts in every room :</l>
     <l n="58">Men feel , they know not why , such places please ;</l>
     <l n="59">His are the spells — they 're idleness and ease ;</l>
     <l n="60">Magic of fatal kind he throws around , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Where care is banish 'd but the heart is bound .</l>
     <l n="62">“ Think not of beauty ; when a maid you meet ,</l>
     <l n="63">Turn from her view , and step across the street ;</l>
     <l n="64">Dread all the sex : their looks create a charm ,</l>
     <l n="65">A smile should fright you and a word alarm .</l>
     <l n="66">E'en I myself , with all my watchful care , }</l>
     <l n="67">Have for an instant felt th ’ insidious snare , }</l>
     <l n="68">And caught my sinful eyes at th ’ endangering stare ; }</l>
     <l n="69">Till I was forced to smite my bounding breast</l>
     <l n="70">With forceful blow and bid the bold-one rest . 70</l>
     <l n="71">“ Go not with crowds when they to pleasure run ,</l>
     <l n="72">But public joy in private safety shun .</l>
     <l n="73">When bells , diverted from their true intent , }</l>
     <l n="74">Ring loud for some deluded mortal sent }</l>
     <l n="75">To hear or make long speech in parliament ; }</l>
     <l n="76">What time the many , that unruly beast ,</l>
     <l n="77">Roars its rough joy and shares the final feast :</l>
     <l n="78">Then heed my counsel , shut thine ears and eyes ;</l>
     <l n="79">A few will hear me — for the few are wise . ”</l>
     <l n="80">Not Satan 's friends , nor Satan 's self could bear 80</l>
     <l n="81">The cautious man who took of souls such care :</l>
     <l n="82">An interloper — one who , out of place ,</l>
     <l n="83">Had volunteer 'd upon the side of grace .</l>
     <l n="84">There was his master ready once a week</l>
     <l n="85">To give advice ; what further need he seek ?</l>
     <l n="86">“ Amen , so be it : ” — what had he to do</l>
     <l n="87">With more than this ?— ‘ twas insolent and new ;</l>
     <l n="88">And some determined on a way to see</l>
     <l n="89">How frail he was , that so it might not be .</l>
     <l n="90">First they essay 'd to tempt our saint to sin , 90</l>
     <l n="91">By points of doctrine argued at an inn ;</l>
     <l n="92">Where he might warmly reason , deeply drink ,</l>
     <l n="93">Then lose all power to argue and to think .</l>
     <l n="94">In vain they tried ; he took the question up ,</l>
     <l n="95">Clear 'd every doubt , and barely touch 'd the cup ;</l>
     <l n="96">By many a text he proved his doctrine sound ,</l>
     <l n="97">And look 'd in triumph on the tempters round .</l>
     <l n="98">Next ‘ twas their care an artful lass to find ,</l>
     <l n="99">Who might consult him , as perplex 'd in mind ;</l>
     <l n="100">She , they conceived , might put her case with fears , 100</l>
     <l n="101">With tender tremblings and seducing tears ;</l>
     <l n="102">She might such charms of various kind display ,</l>
     <l n="103">That he would feel their force and melt away :</l>
     <l n="104">For why of nymphs such caution and such dread ,</l>
     <l n="105">Unless he felt and fear 'd to be misled ?</l>
     <l n="106">She came , she spake : he calmly heard her case ,</l>
     <l n="107">And plainly told her ‘ twas a want of grace ;</l>
     <l n="108">Bade her “ such fancies and affections check ,</l>
     <l n="109">And wear a thicker muslin on her neck . ”</l>
     <l n="110">Abased , his human foes the combat fled , 110</l>
     <l n="111">And the stern clerk yet higher held his head .</l>
     <l n="112">They were indeed a weak , impatient set ;</l>
     <l n="113">But their shrewd prompter had his engines yet ;</l>
     <l n="114">Had various means to make a mortal trip ,</l>
     <l n="115">Who shunn 'd a flowing bowl and rosy lip ;</l>
     <l n="116">And knew a thousand ways his heart to move ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who flies from banquets and who laughs at love .</l>
     <l n="118">Thus far the playful Muse has lent her aid ,</l>
     <l n="119">But now departs , of graver theme afraid ;</l>
     <l n="120">Her may we seek in more appropriate time — 120</l>
     <l n="121">There is no jesting with distress and crime .</l>
     <l n="122">Our worthy clerk had now arrived at fame ,</l>
     <l n="123">Such as but few in his degree might claim ;</l>
     <l n="124">But he was poor , and wanted not the sense</l>
     <l n="125">That lowly rates the praise without the pence :</l>
     <l n="126">He saw the common herd with reverence treat</l>
     <l n="127">The weakest burgess whom they chanced to meet ;</l>
     <l n="128">While few respected his exalted views ,</l>
     <l n="129">And all beheld his doublet and his shoes ;</l>
     <l n="130">None , when they meet , would to his parts allow 130</l>
     <l n="131">( Save his poor boys ) a hearing or a bow .</l>
     <l n="132">To this false judgment of the vulgar mind</l>
     <l n="133">He was not fully , as a saint , resign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="134">He found it much his jealous soul affect ,</l>
     <l n="135">To fear derision and to find neglect .</l>
     <l n="136">The year was bad , the christening-fees were small ,</l>
     <l n="137">The weddings few , the parties paupers all :</l>
     <l n="138">Desire of gain , with fear of want combined ,</l>
     <l n="139">Raised sad commotion in his wounded mind ;</l>
     <l n="140">Wealth was in all his thoughts , his views , his dreams , 140</l>
     <l n="141">And prompted base desires and baseless schemes .</l>
     <l n="142">Alas ! how often erring mortals keep</l>
     <l n="143">The strongest watch against the foes who sleep ;</l>
     <l n="144">While the more wakeful , bold and artful foe</l>
     <l n="145">Is suffer 'd guardless and unmark 'd to go .</l>
     <l n="146">Once in a month the sacramental bread</l>
     <l n="147">Our clerk with wine upon the table spread ;</l>
     <l n="148">The custom this , that , as the vicar reads ,</l>
     <l n="149">He for our off'rings round the church proceeds .</l>
     <l n="150">Tall , spacious seats the wealthier people hid , 150</l>
     <l n="151">And none had view of what his neighbour did ;</l>
     <l n="152">Laid on the box and mingled when they fell ,</l>
     <l n="153">Who should the worth of each oblation tell ?</l>
     <l n="154">Now as poor Jachin took the usual round ,</l>
     <l n="155">And saw the alms and heard the metal sound ,</l>
     <l n="156">He had a thought ;— at first it was no more</l>
     <l n="157">Than — “ these have cash and give it to the poor . ”</l>
     <l n="158">A second thought from this to work began —</l>
     <l n="159">“ And can they give it to a poorer man ? ”</l>
     <l n="160">Proceeding thus — “ My merit could they know , 160</l>
     <l n="161">And knew my need , how freely they 'd bestow ;</l>
     <l n="162">But though they know not , these remain the same ;</l>
     <l n="163">And are a strong , although a secret claim :</l>
     <l n="164">To me , alas ! the want and worth are known ;—</l>
     <l n="165">Why then , in fact , ‘ tis but to take my own . ”</l>
     <l n="166">Thought after thought pour 'd in , a tempting train —</l>
     <l n="167">“ Suppose it done , who is it could complain ?</l>
     <l n="168">How could the poor ? for they such trifles share</l>
     <l n="169">As add no comfort , as suppress no care ;</l>
     <l n="170">But many a pittance makes a worthy heap — 170</l>
     <l n="171">What says the law ? that silence puts to sleep ;—</l>
     <l n="172">Nought then forbids , the danger could we shun ;</l>
     <l n="173">And sure the business may be safely done .</l>
     <l n="174">“ But am I earnest ?— earnest ? No .— I say ,</l>
     <l n="175">If such my mind , that I could plan a way ;</l>
     <l n="176">Let me reflect ;— I 've not allow 'd me time</l>
     <l n="177">To purse the pieces , and if dropp 'd they 'd chime . ”</l>
     <l n="178">Fertile is evil in the soul of man —</l>
     <l n="179">He paused — said Jachin , “ They may drop on bran .</l>
     <l n="180">Why then ‘ tis safe and ( all consider 'd ) just ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">The poor receive it — ‘ tis no breach of trust ;</l>
     <l n="182">The old and widows may their trifles miss ,</l>
     <l n="183">There must be evil in a good like this .</l>
     <l n="184">But I 'll be kind — the sick I 'll visit twice ,</l>
     <l n="185">When now but once , and freely give advice .</l>
     <l n="186">Yet let me think again , ” — Again he tried</l>
     <l n="187">For stronger reasons on his passion 's side ;</l>
     <l n="188">And quickly these were found , yet slowly he complied .</l>
     <l n="189">The morning came : the common service done —</l>
     <l n="190">Shut every door — the solemn rite begun ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">And , as the priest the sacred sayings read ,</l>
     <l n="192">The clerk went forward , trembling as he tread ;</l>
     <l n="193">O'er the tall pew he held the box , and heard</l>
     <l n="194">The offer 'd piece , rejoicing as he fear 'd .</l>
     <l n="195">Just by the pillar , as he cautious tripp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="196">And turn 'd the aile , he then a portion slipp 'd</l>
     <l n="197">From the full store , and to the pocket sent ,</l>
     <l n="198">But held a moment — and then down it went .</l>
     <l n="199">The priest read on ; on walk 'd the man afraid ,</l>
     <l n="200">Till a gold offering in the plate was laid ; 200</l>
     <l n="201">Trembling he took it , for a moment stopp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="202">Then down it fell , and sounded as it dropp 'd ;</l>
     <l n="203">Amazed he started , for th ’ affrighted man ,</l>
     <l n="204">Lost and bewildered , thought not of the bran ;</l>
     <l n="205">But all were silent , all on things intent</l>
     <l n="206">Of high concern ; none ear to money lent ;</l>
     <l n="207">So on he walk 'd , more cautious than before ,</l>
     <l n="208">And gain 'd the purposed sum , and one piece more .</l>
     <l n="209">Practice makes perfect ;— when the month came round ,</l>
     <l n="210">He dropp 'd the cash , nor listen 'd for a sound ; 210</l>
     <l n="211">But yet , when , last of all th ’ assembled flock ,</l>
     <l n="212">He ate and drank — it gave th ’ electric shock .</l>
     <l n="213">Oft was he forced his reasons to repeat ,</l>
     <l n="214">Ere he could kneel in quiet at his seat ;</l>
     <l n="215">But custom soothed him .— Ere a single year</l>
     <l n="216">All this was done without restraint or fear :</l>
     <l n="217">Cool and collected , easy and composed ,</l>
     <l n="218">He was correct till all the service closed ;</l>
     <l n="219">Then to his home , without a groan or sigh ,</l>
     <l n="220">Gravely he went , and laid his treasure by . 220</l>
     <l n="221">Want will complain : some widows had express 'd</l>
     <l n="222">A doubt if they were favour 'd like the rest ;</l>
     <l n="223">The rest described with like regret their dole ,</l>
     <l n="224">And thus from parts they reason 'd to the whole ;</l>
     <l n="225">When all agreed some evil must be done ,</l>
     <l n="226">Or rich men 's hearts grew harder than a stone .</l>
     <l n="227">Our easy vicar cut the matter short ;</l>
     <l n="228">He would not listen to such vile report .</l>
     <l n="229">All were not thus — there govern 'd in that year }</l>
     <l n="230">A stern stout churl , an angry overseer ; 230 }</l>
     <l n="231">A tyrant fond of power , loud , lewd , and most severe . }</l>
     <l n="232">Him the mild vicar , him the graver clerk ,</l>
     <l n="233">Advised , reproved , but nothing would he mark ,</l>
     <l n="234">Save the disgrace ; “ and that , my friends , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="235">“ Will I avenge , whenever time may be . ”</l>
     <l n="236">And now , alas ! ‘ twas time ;— from man to man</l>
     <l n="237">Doubt and alarm and shrewd suspicions ran .</l>
     <l n="238">With angry spirit and with sly intent ,</l>
     <l n="239">This parish ruler to the altar went ;</l>
     <l n="240">A private mark he fix 'd on shillings three , 240</l>
     <l n="241">And but one mark could in the money see ;</l>
     <l n="242">Besides , in peering round , he chanced to note</l>
     <l n="243">A sprinkling slight on Jachin 's Sunday-coat .</l>
     <l n="244">All doubt was over :— when the flock were bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="245">In wrath he rose , and thus his mind express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="246">“ Foul deeds are here ! ” and , saying this , he took</l>
     <l n="247">The clerk , whose conscience , in her cold-fit , shook .</l>
     <l n="248">His pocket then was emptied on the place ;</l>
     <l n="249">All saw his guilt ; all witness 'd his disgrace :</l>
     <l n="250">He fell , he fainted ; not a groan , a look , 250</l>
     <l n="251">Escaped the culprit ; ‘ twas a final stroke —</l>
     <l n="252">A death-wound never to be heal 'd — a fall</l>
     <l n="253">That all had witness 'd , and amazed were all .</l>
     <l n="254">As he recover 'd , to his mind it came ,</l>
     <l n="255">“ I owe to Satan this disgrace and shame . ”</l>
     <l n="256">All the seduction now appear 'd in view ;</l>
     <l n="257">“ Let me withdraw , ” he said , and he withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="258">No one withheld him , all in union cried ,</l>
     <l n="259">E'en the avenger — “ We are satisfied ; ”</l>
     <l n="260">For what has death in any form to give , 260</l>
     <l n="261">Equal to that man 's terrors , if he live ?</l>
     <l n="262">He lived in freedom , but he hourly saw</l>
     <l n="263">How much more fatal justice is than law ;</l>
     <l n="264">He saw another in his office reign ,</l>
     <l n="265">And his mild master treat him with disdain ;</l>
     <l n="266">He saw that all men shunn 'd him , some reviled ;</l>
     <l n="267">The harsh pass 'd frowning , and the simple smiled ;</l>
     <l n="268">The town maintain 'd him , but with some reproof ;</l>
     <l n="269">“ And clerks and scholars proudly kept aloof . ”</l>
     <l n="270">In each lone place , dejected and dismay 'd , 270</l>
     <l n="271">Shrinking from view , his wasting form he laid ;</l>
     <l n="272">Or to the restless sea and roaring wind</l>
     <l n="273">Gave the strong yearnings of a ruin 'd mind .</l>
     <l n="274">On the broad beach , the silent summer day ,</l>
     <l n="275">Stretch 'd on some wreck , he wore his life away ;</l>
     <l n="276">Or where the river mingles with the sea , }</l>
     <l n="277">Or on the mud-bank by the elder-tree , }</l>
     <l n="278">Or by the bounding marsh-dyke , there was he ; }</l>
     <l n="279">And when unable to forsake the town ,</l>
     <l n="280">In the blind courts he sate desponding down — 280</l>
     <l n="281">Always alone ; then feebly would he crawl</l>
     <l n="282">The church-way walk , and lean upon the wall .</l>
     <l n="283">Too ill for this , he lay beside the door ,</l>
     <l n="284">Compell 'd to hear the reasoning of the poor :</l>
     <l n="285">He look 'd so pale , so weak , the pitying crowd</l>
     <l n="286">Their firm belief of his repentance vow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="287">They saw him then so ghastly and so thin ,</l>
     <l n="288">That they exclaim 'd , “ Is this the work of sin ? ”</l>
     <l n="289">“ Yes , ” in his better moments , he replied ,</l>
     <l n="290">“ Of sinful avarice and the spirit 's pride ;— 290</l>
     <l n="291">While yet untempted , I was safe and well ;</l>
     <l n="292">Temptation came ; I reason 'd , and I fell .</l>
     <l n="293">To be man 's guide and glory I design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="294">A rare example for our sinful kind ;</l>
     <l n="295">But now my weakness and my guilt I see ,</l>
     <l n="296">And am a warning — man , be warn 'd by me ! ”</l>
     <l n="297">He said , and saw no more the human face ;</l>
     <l n="298">To a lone loft he went , his dying place ,</l>
     <l n="299">And , as the vicar of his state inquired ,</l>
     <l n="300">Turn 'd to the wall and silently expired ! 300</l>

     <l n="3">Where the low benches lean beside the door ,</l>
     <l n="4">And the red paling bounds the space before ;</l>
     <l n="5">Where thrift and lavender and lad'shYpppHeNlove<span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>bloom —</l>
     <l n="6">That humble dwelling is the widow 's home .</l>
     <l n="7">There live a pair , for various fortunes known ,</l>
     <l n="8">But the Blind Ellen will relate her own ;—</l>
     <l n="9">Yet , ere we hear the story she can tell ,</l>
     <l n="10">On prouder sorrows let us briefly dwell . 10</l>
     <l n="11">I 've often marvel 'd , when by night , by day ,</l>
     <l n="12">I 've mark 'd the manners moving in my way ,</l>
     <l n="13">And heard the language and beheld the lives</l>
     <l n="14">Of lass and lover , goddesses and wives :</l>
     <l n="15">That books , which promise much of life to give ,</l>
     <l n="16">Should show so little how we truly live .</l>
     <l n="17">To me it seems , their females and their men</l>
     <l n="18">Are but the creatures of the author 's pen ;</l>
     <l n="19">Nay , creatures borrow 'd and again convey 'd</l>
     <l n="20">From book to book — the shadows of a shade . 20</l>
     <l n="21">Life , if they 'd search , would show them many a change ,</l>
     <l n="22">The ruin sudden and the misery strange !</l>
     <l n="23">With more of grievous , base , and dreadful things ,</l>
     <l n="24">Than novelists relate or poet sings .</l>
     <l n="25">But they , who ought to look the world around ,</l>
     <l n="26">Spy out a single spot in fairy-ground ;</l>
     <l n="27">Where all , in turn , ideal forms behold ,</l>
     <l n="28">And plots are laid and histories are told .</l>
     <l n="29">Time have I lent — I would their debt were less —</l>
     <l n="30">To flow'ry pages of sublime distress ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">And to the heroine 's soul-distracting fears</l>
     <l n="32">I early gave my sixpences and tears :</l>
     <l n="33">Oft have I travell 'd in these tender tales ,</l>
     <l n="34">To Darnley-Cottages and Maple-Vales ,</l>
     <l n="35">And watch 'd the fair-one from the first-born sigh ,</l>
     <l n="36">When Henry pass 'd and gazed in passing by ;</l>
     <l n="37">Till I beheld them pacing in the park ,</l>
     <l n="38">Close by a coppice where ‘ twas cold and dark ;</l>
     <l n="39">When such affection with such fate appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="40">Want and a father to be shunn 'd and fear 'd , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Without employment , prospect , cot , or cash ,</l>
     <l n="42">That I have judged th ’ heroic souls were rash .</l>
     <l n="43">Now shifts the scene — the fair , in tower confined ,</l>
     <l n="44">In all things suffers but in change of mind ;</l>
     <l n="45">Now woo 'd by greatness to a bed of state ,</l>
     <l n="46">Now deeply threaten 'd with a dungeon 's grate ;</l>
     <l n="47">Till , suffering much and being tried enough ,</l>
     <l n="48">She shines , triumphant maid !— temptation-proof .</l>
     <l n="49">Then was I led to vengeful monks , who mix</l>
     <l n="50">With nymphs and swains , and play unpriestly tricks ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Then view 'd banditti , who in forest wide ,</l>
     <l n="52">And cavern vast , indignant virgins hide ;</l>
     <l n="53">Who , hemm 'd with bands of sturdiest rogues about ,</l>
     <l n="54">Find some strange succour , and come virgins out .</l>
     <l n="55">I 've watch 'd a wint'ry night on castle-walls ;</l>
     <l n="56">I 've stalk 'd by moonlight through deserted halls ;</l>
     <l n="57">And , when the weary world was sunk to rest ,</l>
     <l n="58">I 've had such sights as — may not be express 'd .</l>
     <l n="59">Lo ! that chateau , the western tower decay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="60">The peasants shun it — they are all afraid ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">For there was done a deed !— could walls reveal ,</l>
     <l n="62">Or timbers tell it , how the heart would feel !</l>
     <l n="63">Most horrid was it :— for , behold , the floor</l>
     <l n="64">Has stain of blood , and will be clean no more .</l>
     <l n="65">Hark to the winds ! which through the wide saloon</l>
     <l n="66">And the long passage send a dismal tune —</l>
     <l n="67">Music that ghosts delight in ;— and now heed</l>
     <l n="68">Yon beauteous nymph , who must unmask the deed .</l>
     <l n="69">See ! with majestic sweep she swims alone</l>
     <l n="70">Through rooms , all dreary , guided by a groan ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">Though windows rattle , and though tap'stries shake ,</l>
     <l n="72">And the feet falter every step they take ,</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Mid groans and gibing sprights she silent goes , }</l>
     <l n="74">To find a something , which will soon expose }</l>
     <l n="75">The villanies and wiles of her determined foes ; }</l>
     <l n="76">And , having thus adventured , thus endured ,</l>
     <l n="77">Fame , wealth , and lover , are for life secured .</l>
     <l n="78">Much have I fear 'd , but am no more afraid ,</l>
     <l n="79">When some chaste beauty , by some wretch betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="80">Is drawn away with such distracted speed , 80</l>
     <l n="81">That she anticipates a dreadful deed ;—</l>
     <l n="82">Not so do I .— Let solid walls impound</l>
     <l n="83">The captive fair , and dig a moat around ;</l>
     <l n="84">Let there be brazen locks and bars of steel ,</l>
     <l n="85">And keepers cruel , such as never feel ;</l>
     <l n="86">With not a single note the purse supply ,</l>
     <l n="87">And when she begs , let men and maids deny ;</l>
     <l n="88">Be windows those from which she dares not fall ,</l>
     <l n="89">And help so distant , ‘ tis in vain to call ;</l>
     <l n="90">Still means of freedom will some power devise , 90</l>
     <l n="91">And from the baffled ruffian snatch his prize .</l>
     <l n="92">To Northern Wales , in some sequester 'd spot ,</l>
     <l n="93">I 've followed fair Louisa to her cot ;</l>
     <l n="94">Where , then a wretched and deserted bride ,</l>
     <l n="95">The injured fair-one wish 'd from man to hide ;</l>
     <l n="96">Till by her fond repenting Belville found ,</l>
     <l n="97">By some kind chance — the straying of a hound —</l>
     <l n="98">He at her feet craved mercy , nor in vain ;</l>
     <l n="99">For the relenting dove flew back again .</l>
     <l n="100">There 's something rapturous in distress , or , oh ! 100 }</l>
     <l n="101">Could Clementina bear her lot of wo ? }</l>
     <l n="102">Or what she underwent could maiden undergo ? }</l>
     <l n="103">The day was fix 'd ; for so the lover sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="104">So knelt and craved , he could n't be denied ;</l>
     <l n="105">When , tale most dreadful ! every hope adieu —</l>
     <l n="106">For the fond lover is the brother too :</l>
     <l n="107">All other griefs abate ; this monstrous grief</l>
     <l n="108">Has no remission , comfort , or relief ;</l>
     <l n="109">Four ample volumes , through each page disclose —</l>
     <l n="110">Good Heaven protect us !— only woes on woes ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Till some strange means afford a sudden view</l>
     <l n="112">Of some vile plot , and every wo adieu !<span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span></l>
     <l n="113">Now , should we grant these beauties all endure</l>
     <l n="114">Severest pangs , they 've still the speediest cure ,</l>
     <l n="115">Before one charm be wither 'd from the face , }</l>
     <l n="116">Except the bloom , which shall again have place , }</l>
     <l n="117">In wedlock ends each wish , in triumph all disgrace ; }</l>
     <l n="118">And life to come we fairly may suppose</l>
     <l n="119">One light , bright contrast to these wild dark woes .</l>
     <l n="120">These let us leave , and at her sorrows look , 120</l>
     <l n="121">Too often seen , but seldom in a book ;</l>
     <l n="122">Let her who felt , relate them .— On her chair</l>
     <l n="123">The heroine sits — in former years the fair ,</l>
     <l n="124">Now aged and poor ; but Ellen Orford knows ,</l>
     <l n="125">That we should humbly take what Heav'n bestows .</l>
     <l n="126">“ My father died — again my mother wed ,</l>
     <l n="127">And found the comforts of her life were fled ;</l>
     <l n="128">Her angry husband , vex 'd through half his years</l>
     <l n="129">By loss and troubles , fill 'd her soul with fears ;</l>
     <l n="130">Their children many , and ‘ twas my poor place 130</l>
     <l n="131">To nurse and wait on all the infant-race ;</l>
     <l n="132">Labour and hunger were indeed my part ,</l>
     <l n="133">And should have strengthen 'd an erroneous heart .</l>
     <l n="134">“ Sore was the grief to see him angry come ,</l>
     <l n="135">And , teased with business , make distress at home ;</l>
     <l n="136">The father 's fury and the children 's cries</l>
     <l n="137">I soon could bear , but not my mother 's sighs ;</l>
     <l n="138">For she look 'd back on comforts , and would say ,</l>
     <l n="139">‘ I wrong 'd thee , Ellen , ’ and then turn away .</l>
     <l n="140">Thus for my age 's good , my youth was tried , 140</l>
     <l n="141">And this my fortune till my mother died .</l>
     <l n="142">“ So , amid sorrow much and little cheer —</l>
     <l n="143">A common case — I pass 'd my twentieth year ;</l>
     <l n="144">For these are frequent evils ; thousands share</l>
     <l n="145">An equal grief — the like domestic care .</l>
     <l n="146">“ Then in my days of bloom , of health and youth ,</l>
     <l n="147">One , much above me , vow 'd his love and truth .</l>
     <l n="148">We often met , he dreading to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="149">And much I question 'd what such dread might mean ;</l>
     <l n="150">Yet I believed him true ; my simple heart 150</l>
     <l n="151">And undirected reason took his part .</l>
     <l n="152">“ Can he who loves me , whom I love , deceive ? }</l>
     <l n="153">Can I such wrong of one so kind believe , }</l>
     <l n="154">Who lives but in my smile , who trembles when I grieve ? }</l>
     <l n="155">“ He dared not marry , but we met to prove</l>
     <l n="156">What sad encroachments and deceits has love :</l>
     <l n="157">Weak that I was , when he , rebuked , withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="158">I let him see that I was wretched too ;</l>
     <l n="159">When less my caution , I had still the pain</l>
     <l n="160">Of his or mine own weakness to complain . 160</l>
     <l n="161">“ Happy the lovers class 'd alike in life ,</l>
     <l n="162">Or happier yet the rich endowing wife ;</l>
     <l n="163">But most aggrieved the fond believing maid ,</l>
     <l n="164">Of her rich lover tenderly afraid .</l>
     <l n="165">You judge th ’ event ; for grievous was my fate ,</l>
     <l n="166">Painful to feel , and shameful to relate :</l>
     <l n="167">Ah ! sad it was my burthen to sustain ,</l>
     <l n="168">When the least misery was the dread of pain ;</l>
     <l n="169">When I have grieving told him my disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="170">And plainly mark 'd indifference in his face . 170</l>
     <l n="171">“ Hard ! with these fears and terrors to behold</l>
     <l n="172">The cause of all , the faithless lover cold ;</l>
     <l n="173">Impatient grown at every wish denied ,</l>
     <l n="174">And barely civil , soothed and gratified ;</l>
     <l n="175">Peevish when urged to think of vows so strong ,</l>
     <l n="176">And angry when I spake of crime and wrong .</l>
     <l n="177">“ All this I felt , and still the sorrow grew ,</l>
     <l n="178">Because I felt that I deserved it too ,</l>
     <l n="179">And begg 'd my infant stranger to forgive</l>
     <l n="180">The mother 's shame , which in herself must live . 180</l>
     <l n="181">“ When known that shame , I , soon expell 'd from home ,</l>
     <l n="182">With a frail sister shared a hovel 's gloom ;</l>
     <l n="183">There barely fed — ( what could I more request ? ) —</l>
     <l n="184">My infant slumberer sleeping at my breast ;</l>
     <l n="185">I from my window saw his blooming bride ,</l>
     <l n="186">And my seducer smiling at her side ;</l>
     <l n="187">Hope lived till then ; I sank upon the floor ,</l>
     <l n="188">And grief and thought and feeling were no more .</l>
     <l n="189">Although revived , I judged that life would close ,</l>
     <l n="190">And went to rest , to wonder that I rose : 190</l>
     <l n="191">My dreams were dismal ; wheresoe'er I stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="192">I seem 'd ashamed , alarm 'd , despised , betray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="193">Always in grief , in guilt , disgraced , forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="194">Mourning that one so weak , so vile , was born ;</l>
     <l n="195">The earth a desert , tumult in the sea , }</l>
     <l n="196">The birds affrighted fled from tree to tree , }</l>
     <l n="197">Obscured the setting sun , and every thing like me ; }</l>
     <l n="198">But Heav'n had mercy , and my need at length</l>
     <l n="199">Urged me to labour and renew 'd my strength .</l>
     <l n="200">“ I strove for patience as a sinner must , 200</l>
     <l n="201">Yet felt th ’ opinion of the world unjust :</l>
     <l n="202">There was my lover , in his joy , esteem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="203">And I , in my distress , as guilty deem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="204">Yet sure , not all the guilt and shame belong</l>
     <l n="205">To her who feels and suffers for the wrong .</l>
     <l n="206">The cheat at play may use the wealth he 's won ,</l>
     <l n="207">But is not honour 'd for the mischief done ;</l>
     <l n="208">The cheat in love may use each villain-art ,</l>
     <l n="209">And boast the deed that breaks the victim 's heart .</l>
     <l n="210">“ Four years were past ; I might again have found 210</l>
     <l n="211">Some erring wish , but for another wound :</l>
     <l n="212">Lovely my daughter grew , her face was fair ;</l>
     <l n="213">But no expression ever brighten 'd there .</l>
     <l n="214">I doubted long , and vainly strove to make</l>
     <l n="215">Some certain meaning of the words she spake ;</l>
     <l n="216">But meaning there was none , and I survey 'd</l>
     <l n="217">With dread the beauties of my idiot-maid .</l>
     <l n="218">“ Still I submitted ;— Oh ! ‘ tis meet and fit</l>
     <l n="219">In all we feel to make the heart submit ;</l>
     <l n="220">Gloomy and calm my days , but I had then , 220</l>
     <l n="221">It seem 'd , attractions for the eyes of men .</l>
     <l n="222">The sober master of a decent trade</l>
     <l n="223">O'erlook ' d my errors , and his offer made ;</l>
     <l n="224">Reason assented ;— true , my heart denied ,</l>
     <l n="225">‘ But thou , ’ I said , ‘ shalt be no more my guide . ’</l>
     <l n="226">“ When wed , our toil and trouble , pains and care ,</l>
     <l n="227">Of means to live procured us humble share ;</l>
     <l n="228">Five were our sons ,— and we , though careful , found</l>
     <l n="229">Our hopes declining as the year came round ;</l>
     <l n="230">For I perceived , yet would not soon perceive , 230</l>
     <l n="231">My husband stealing from my view to grieve ;</l>
     <l n="232">Silent he grew , and when he spoke he sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="233">And surly look 'd and peevishly replied .</l>
     <l n="234">Pensive by nature , he had gone of late</l>
     <l n="235">To those who preach 'd of destiny and fate ,</l>
     <l n="236">Of things fore-doom 'd , and of election-grace ,</l>
     <l n="237">And how in vain we strive to run our race ;</l>
     <l n="238">That all by works and moral worth we gain }</l>
     <l n="239">Is to perceive our care and labour vain ; }</l>
     <l n="240">That still the more we pay , our debts the more remain ; 240 }</l>
     <l n="241">That he who feels not the mysterious call ,</l>
     <l n="242">Lies bound in sin , still grov'ling from the fall .</l>
     <l n="243">My husband felt not ;— our persuasion , prayer ,</l>
     <l n="244">And our best reason darken 'd his despair ;</l>
     <l n="245">His very nature changed ; he now reviled</l>
     <l n="246">My former conduct — he reproach 'd my child ;</l>
     <l n="247">He talk 'd of bastard slips , and cursed his bed ,</l>
     <l n="248">And from our kindness to concealment fled ;</l>
     <l n="249">For ever to some evil change inclined , }</l>
     <l n="250">To every gloomy thought he lent his mind , 250 }</l>
     <l n="251">Nor rest would give to us , nor rest himself could find ; }</l>
     <l n="252">His son suspended saw him , long bereft</l>
     <l n="253">Of life , nor prospect of revival left .</l>
     <l n="254">“ With him died all our prospects , and once more</l>
     <l n="255">I shared th ’ allotments of the parish poor ;</l>
     <l n="256">They took my children too , and this I know</l>
     <l n="257">Was just and lawful , but I felt the blow ;</l>
     <l n="258">My idiot-maid and one unhealthy boy</l>
     <l n="259">Were left , a mother 's misery and her joy .</l>
     <l n="260">“ Three sons I follow 'd to the grave , and one — 260</l>
     <l n="261">Oh ! can I speak of that unhappy son ?</l>
     <l n="262">Would all the memory of that time were fled ,</l>
     <l n="263">And all those horrors , with my child , were dead !</l>
     <l n="264">Before the world seduced him , what a grace</l>
     <l n="265">And smile of gladness shone upon his face !</l>
     <l n="266">Then he had knowledge ; finely would he write ;</l>
     <l n="267">Study to him was pleasure and delight ;</l>
     <l n="268">Great was his courage , and but few could stand</l>
     <l n="269">Against the sleight and vigour of his hand ;</l>
     <l n="270">The maidens loved him ;— when he came to die , 270</l>
     <l n="271">No , not the coldest could suppress a sigh .</l>
     <l n="272">Here I must cease — how can I say , my child</l>
     <l n="273">Was by the bad of either sex beguiled ?</l>
     <l n="274">Worst of the bad — they taught him that the laws</l>
     <l n="275">Made wrong and right ; there was no other cause ;</l>
     <l n="276">That all religion was the trade of priests ,</l>
     <l n="277">And men , when dead , must perish like the beasts ;—</l>
     <l n="278">And he , so lively and so gay before —</l>
     <l n="279">Ah ! spare a mother — I can tell no more .</l>
     <l n="280">“ Int'rest was made that they should not destroy 280</l>
     <l n="281">The comely form of my deluded boy —</l>
     <l n="282">But pardon came not ; damp the place and deep</l>
     <l n="283">Where he was kept , as they 'd a tiger keep ;</l>
     <l n="284">For he , unhappy ! had before them all</l>
     <l n="285">Vow 'd he 'd escape , whatever might befall .</l>
     <l n="286">“ He 'd means of dress , and dress 'd beyond his means ,</l>
     <l n="287">And , so to see him in such dismal scenes ,</l>
     <l n="288">I cannot speak it — cannot bear to tell</l>
     <l n="289">Of that sad hour — I heard the passing-bell !</l>
     <l n="290">“ Slowly they went ; he smiled and look 'd so smart , 290</l>
     <l n="291">Yet sure he shudder 'd when he saw the cart ,</l>
     <l n="292">And gave a look — until my dying-day ,</l>
     <l n="293">That look will never from my mind away ;</l>
     <l n="294">Oft as I sit , and ever in my dreams ,</l>
     <l n="295">I see that look , and they have heard my screams .</l>
     <l n="296">“ Now let me speak no more — yet all declared</l>
     <l n="297">That one so young , in pity should be spared ,</l>
     <l n="298">And one so manly ;— on his graceful neck ,</l>
     <l n="299">That chains of jewels may be proud to deck ,</l>
     <l n="300">To a small mole a mother 's lips have press 'd — 300</l>
     <l n="301">And there the cord — my breath is sore oppress 'd .</l>
     <l n="302">“ I now can speak again :— my elder boy</l>
     <l n="303">Was that year drown 'd — a seaman in a hoy .</l>
     <l n="304">He left a numerous race ; of these would some</l>
     <l n="305">In their young troubles to my cottage come ;</l>
     <l n="306">And these I taught — an humble teacher I —</l>
     <l n="307">Upon their heavenly Parent to rely .</l>
     <l n="308">“ Alas ! I needed such reliance more :—</l>
     <l n="309">My idiot-girl , so simply gay before ,</l>
     <l n="310">Now wept in pain ; some wretch had found a time , 310</l>
     <l n="311">Depraved and wicked , for that coward-crime ;</l>
     <l n="312">I had indeed my doubt , but I suppress 'd</l>
     <l n="313">The thought that day and night disturb 'd my rest ;</l>
     <l n="314">She and that sick-pale brother — but why strive</l>
     <l n="315">To keep the terrors of that time alive ?</l>
     <l n="316">“ The hour arrived , the new , th ’ undreaded pain ,</l>
     <l n="317">That came with violence and yet came in vain .</l>
     <l n="318">I saw her die ; her brother too is dead ,</l>
     <l n="319">Nor own 'd such crime — what is it that I dread ?</l>
     <l n="320">“ The parish-aid withdrawn , I look 'd around , 320</l>
     <l n="321">And in my school a bless 'd subsistence found —</l>
     <l n="322">My winter-calm of life : to be of use</l>
     <l n="323">Would pleasant thoughts and heavenly hopes produce ;</l>
     <l n="324">I loved them all ; it soothed me to presage</l>
     <l n="325">The various trials of their riper age ,</l>
     <l n="326">Then dwell on mine , and bless the Power who gave</l>
     <l n="327">Pains to correct us , and remorse to save .</l>
     <l n="328">“ Yes ! these were days of peace , but they are past —</l>
     <l n="329">A trial came , I will believe , a last ;</l>
     <l n="330">I lost my sight , and my employment gone , 330</l>
     <l n="331">Useless I live , but to the day live on ;</l>
     <l n="332">Those eyes , which long the light of heaven enjoy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="333">Were not by pain , by agony destroy 'd ;</l>
     <l n="334">My senses fail not all ; I speak , I pray ;</l>
     <l n="335">By night my rest , my food I take by day ;</l>
     <l n="336">And as my mind looks cheerful to my end ,</l>
     <l n="337">I love mankind and call my God my friend . ”</l>

   <p>As this incident points out the work alluded to , I wish it to be remembered , that the gloomy tenour , the querulous melancholy of the story , is all I censure . The language of the writer is often animated , and is , I believe , correct ; the characters well drawn , and the manners described from real life ; but the perpetual occurrence of sad events , the protracted list of teasing and perplexing mischances , joined with much waspish invective , unallayed by pleasantry or sprightliness , and these continued through many hundred pages , render publications , intended for amusement and executed with ability , heavy and displeasing ;— you find your favourite persons happy in the end ; but they have teased you so much with their perplexities by the way , that you were frequently disposed to quit them in their distresses .</p>

    <head>LETTER XXI .</head>
    <head>ABEL KEENE .</head>
     <l n="1">A quiet simple man was Abel Keene ;</l>
     <l n="2">He meant no harm , nor did he often mean .</l>
     <l n="3">He kept a school of loud rebellious boys ,</l>
     <l n="4">And growing old , grew nervous with the noise ;</l>
     <l n="5">When a kind merchant hired his useful pen ,</l>
     <l n="6">And made him happiest of accompting men ;</l>
     <l n="7">With glee he rose to every easy day ,</l>
     <l n="8">When half the labour brought him twice the pay .</l>
     <l n="9">There were young clerks , and there the merchant 's son ,</l>
     <l n="10">Choice spirits all , who wish 'd him to be one ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">It must , no question , give them lively joy ,</l>
     <l n="12">Hopes long indulged , to combat and destroy ;</l>
     <l n="13">At these they level 'd all their skill and strength —</l>
     <l n="14">He fell not quickly , but he fell at length .</l>
     <l n="15">They quoted books , to him both bold and new ,</l>
     <l n="16">And scorn 'd as fables all he held as true —</l>
     <l n="17">“ Such monkish stories and such nursery lies , ”</l>
     <l n="18">That he was struck with terror and surprise .</l>
     <l n="19">“ What ! all his life had he the laws obey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="20">Which they broke through and were not once afraid ? 20</l>
     <l n="21">Had he so long his evil passions check 'd ,</l>
     <l n="22">And yet at last had nothing to expect ?</l>
     <l n="23">While they their lives in joy and pleasure led ,</l>
     <l n="24">And then had nothing , at the end , to dread ?</l>
     <l n="25">Was all his priest with so much zeal convey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">A part ! a speech ! for which the man was paid ?</l>
     <l n="27">And were his pious books , his solemn prayers ,</l>
     <l n="28">Not worth one tale of the admired Voltaire 's ?</l>
     <l n="29">Then was it time , while yet some years remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="30">To drink untroubled and to think unchain 'd , 30</l>
     <l n="31">And on all pleasures , which his purse could give ,</l>
     <l n="32">Freely to seize , and while he lived , to live . ”</l>
     <l n="33">Much time he passed in this important strife ,</l>
     <l n="34">The bliss or bane of his remaining life ;</l>
     <l n="35">For converts all are made with care and grief ,</l>
     <l n="36">And pangs attend the birth of unbelief ;</l>
     <l n="37">Nor pass they soon ;— with awe and fear he took</l>
     <l n="38">The flow'ry way , and cast back many a look .</l>
     <l n="39">The youths applauded much his wise design ,</l>
     <l n="40">With weighty reasoning o'er their evening wine ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">And much in private ‘ twould their mirth improve ,</l>
     <l n="42">To hear how Abel spake of life and love ;</l>
     <l n="43">To hear him own what grievous pains it cost ,</l>
     <l n="44">Ere the old saint was in the sinner lost ;</l>
     <l n="45">Ere his poor mind with every deed alarm 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">By wit was settled , and by vice was charm 'd .</l>
     <l n="47">For Abel enter 'd in his bold career ,</l>
     <l n="48">Like boys on ice , with pleasure and with fear ;</l>
     <l n="49">Lingering , yet longing for the joy , he went ,</l>
     <l n="50">Repenting now , now dreading to repent ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">With awkward pace , and with himself at war ,</l>
     <l n="52">Far gone , yet frighten 'd that he went so far ;</l>
     <l n="53">Oft for his efforts he 'd solicit praise ,</l>
     <l n="54">And then proceed with blunders and delays .</l>
     <l n="55">The young more aptly passion 's calls pursue , }</l>
     <l n="56">But age and weakness start at scenes so new , }</l>
     <l n="57">And tremble when they 've done , for all they dared to do . }</l>
     <l n="58">At length example Abel 's dread removed ;</l>
     <l n="59">With small concern he sought the joys he loved ;</l>
     <l n="60">Not resting here , he claim 'd his share of fame , 60</l>
     <l n="61">And first their votary , then their wit became ;</l>
     <l n="62">His jest was bitter and his satire bold ,</l>
     <l n="63">When he his tales of formal brethren told ,</l>
     <l n="64">What time with pious neighbours he discuss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="65">Their boasted treasure and their boundless trust :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Such were our dreams , ” the jovial elder cried ;</l>
     <l n="67">“ Awake and live , ” his youthful friends replied .</l>
     <l n="68">Now the gay clerk a modest drab despised ,</l>
     <l n="69">And clad him smartly as his friends advised ;</l>
     <l n="70">So fine a coat upon his back he threw , 70</l>
     <l n="71">That not an alley-boy old Abel knew ;</l>
     <l n="72">Broad polish 'd buttons blazed that coat upon ,</l>
     <l n="73">And just beneath the watch 's trinkets shone —</l>
     <l n="74">A splendid watch , that pointed out the time ,</l>
     <l n="75">To fly from business and make free with crime .</l>
     <l n="76">The crimson waistcoat and the silken hose</l>
     <l n="77">Rank 'd the lean man among the Borough beaux ;</l>
     <l n="78">His raven hair he cropp 'd with fierce disdain ,</l>
     <l n="79">And light elastic locks encased his brain :</l>
     <l n="80">More pliant pupil who could hope to find , 80</l>
     <l n="81">So deck 'd in person and so changed in mind ?</l>
     <l n="82">When Abel walk 'd the streets , with pleasant mien</l>
     <l n="83">He met his friends , delighted to be seen ;</l>
     <l n="84">And , when he rode along the public way ,</l>
     <l n="85">No beau so gaudy and no youth so gay .</l>
     <l n="86">His pious sister , now an ancient maid , }</l>
     <l n="87">For Abel fearing , first in secret pray 'd ; }</l>
     <l n="88">Then thus in love and scorn her notions she convey 'd : }</l>
     <l n="89">“ Alas ! my brother ! can I see thee pace }</l>
     <l n="90">Hoodwink 'd to hell , and not lament thy case , 90 }</l>
     <l n="91">Nor stretch my feeble hand to stop thy headlong race ? }</l>
     <l n="92">Lo ! thou art bound ; a slave in Satan 's chain ,</l>
     <l n="93">The righteous Abel turn 'd the wretched Cain ;</l>
     <l n="94">His brother 's blood against the murderer cried ;</l>
     <l n="95">Against thee thine , unhappy suicide !</l>
     <l n="96">Are all our pious nights and peaceful days ,</l>
     <l n="97">Our evening readings and our morning praise ,</l>
     <l n="98">Our spirits ’ comfort in the trials sent ,</l>
     <l n="99">Our hearts ’ rejoicings in the blessings lent ,</l>
     <l n="100">All that o'er grief a cheering influence shed — 100</l>
     <l n="101">Are these for ever and for ever fled ?</l>
     <l n="102">“ When in the years gone by , the trying years ,</l>
     <l n="103">When faith and hope had strife with wants and fears ,</l>
     <l n="104">Thy nerves have trembled till thou couldst not eat</l>
     <l n="105">( Dress 'd by this hand ) thy mess of simple meat ;</l>
     <l n="106">When , grieved by fastings , gall 'd by fates severe ,</l>
     <l n="107">Slow pass 'd the days of the successless year ;</l>
     <l n="108">Still in these gloomy hours , my brother then</l>
     <l n="109">Had glorious views , unseen by prosperous men :</l>
     <l n="110">And when thy heart has felt its wish denied , 110</l>
     <l n="111">What gracious texts hast thou to grief applied ;</l>
     <l n="112">Till thou hast enter 'd in thine humble bed ,</l>
     <l n="113">By lofty hopes and heavenly musings fed ;</l>
     <l n="114">Then I have seen thy lively looks express</l>
     <l n="115">The spirit 's comforts in the man 's distress .</l>
     <l n="116">“ Then didst thou cry , exulting , ‘ Yes , ‘ tis fit ,</l>
     <l n="117">‘ Tis meet and right , my heart ! that we submit ; ’</l>
     <l n="118">And wilt thou , Abel , thy new pleasures weigh</l>
     <l n="119">Against such triumphs ?— Oh ! repent and pray .</l>
     <l n="120">“ What are thy pleasures ?— with the gay to sit , 120</l>
     <l n="121">And thy poor brain torment for awkward wit ;</l>
     <l n="122">All thy good thoughts ( thou hat'st them ) to restrain ,</l>
     <l n="123">And give a wicked pleasure to the vain ;</l>
     <l n="124">Thy long lean frame by fashion to attire ,</l>
     <l n="125">That lads may laugh and wantons may admire ;</l>
     <l n="126">To raise the mirth of boys , and not to see ,</l>
     <l n="127">Unhappy maniac ! that they laugh at thee .</l>
     <l n="128">“ These boyish follies , which alone the boy</l>
     <l n="129">Can idly act or gracefully enjoy ,</l>
     <l n="130">Add new reproaches to thy fallen state , 130</l>
     <l n="131">And make men scorn what they would only hate .</l>
     <l n="132">“ What pains , my brother , dost thou take to prove</l>
     <l n="133">A taste for follies which thou canst not love !</l>
     <l n="134">Why do thy stiffening limbs the steed bestride —</l>
     <l n="135">That lads may laugh to see thou canst not ride ?</l>
     <l n="136">And why ( I feel the crimson tinge my cheek )</l>
     <l n="137">Dost thou by night in Diamond-Alley sneak ?</l>
     <l n="138">“ Farewell ! the parish will thy sister keep , }</l>
     <l n="139">Where she in peace shall pray and sing and sleep , }</l>
     <l n="140">Save when for thee she mourns , thou wicked , wandering sheep ! 140 }</l>
     <l n="141">When youth is fall'n , there 's hope the young may rise ,</l>
     <l n="142">But fallen age for ever hopeless lies :</l>
     <l n="143">Torn up by storms and placed in earth once more ,</l>
     <l n="144">The younger tree may sun and soil restore ;</l>
     <l n="145">But when the old and sapless trunk lies low ,</l>
     <l n="146">No care or soil can former life bestow ;</l>
     <l n="147">Reserved for burning is the worthless tree ;</l>
     <l n="148">And what , O Abel ! is reserved for thee ? ”</l>
     <l n="149">These angry words our hero deeply felt ,</l>
     <l n="150">Though hard his heart , and indisposed to melt ! 150</l>
     <l n="151">To gain relief he took a glass the more ,</l>
     <l n="152">And , then went on as careless as before ;</l>
     <l n="153">Thenceforth , uncheck 'd , amusements he partook ,</l>
     <l n="154">And ( save his ledger ) saw no decent book ;</l>
     <l n="155">Him found the merchant punctual at his task ,</l>
     <l n="156">And , that perform 'd , he 'd nothing more to ask ;</l>
     <l n="157">He cared not how old Abel play 'd the fool ,</l>
     <l n="158">No master he , beyond the hours of school :</l>
     <l n="159">Thus they , proceeding , had their wine and joke ,</l>
     <l n="160">Till merchant Dixon felt a warning stroke , 160</l>
     <l n="161">And , after struggling half a gloomy week ,</l>
     <l n="162">Left his poor clerk another friend to seek .</l>
     <l n="163">Alas ! the son , who led the saint astray ,</l>
     <l n="164">Forgot the man whose follies made him gay ;</l>
     <l n="165">He cared no more for Abel in his need ,</l>
     <l n="166">[ Than ] Abel cared about his hackney steed ;</l>
     <l n="167">He now , alas ! had all his earnings spent ,</l>
     <l n="168">And thus was left to languish and repent ;</l>
     <l n="169">No school nor clerkship found he in the place ,</l>
     <l n="170">Now lost to fortune , as before to grace . 170</l>
     <l n="171">For town-relief the grieving man applied ,</l>
     <l n="172">And begg 'd with tears what some with scorn denied ;</l>
     <l n="173">Others look 'd down upon the glowing vest ,</l>
     <l n="174">And , frowning , ask 'd him at what price he dress 'd ?</l>
     <l n="175">Happy for him his country 's laws are mild ,</l>
     <l n="176">They must support him , though they still reviled ;</l>
     <l n="177">Grieved , abject , scorn 'd , insulted , and betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="178">Of God unmindful , and of man afraid —</l>
     <l n="179">No more he talk 'd ; ‘ twas pain , ‘ twas shame to speak ,</l>
     <l n="180">His heart was sinking and his frame was weak . 180</l>
     <l n="181">His sister died with such serene delight ,</l>
     <l n="182">He once again began to think her right ;</l>
     <l n="183">Poor like himself , the happy spinster lay ,</l>
     <l n="184">And sweet assurance bless 'd her dying-day ;</l>
     <l n="185">Poor like the spinster , he , when death was nigh ,</l>
     <l n="186">Assured of nothing , felt afraid to die .</l>
     <l n="187">The cheerful clerks who sometimes pass 'd the door ,</l>
     <l n="188">Just mention 'd “ Abel ! ” and then thought no more .</l>
     <l n="189">So Abel , pondering on his state forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="190">Look 'd round for comfort , and was chased by scorn . 190</l>
     <l n="191">And now we saw him on the beach reclined ,</l>
     <l n="192">Or causeless walking in the wint'ry wind ;</l>
     <l n="193">And , when it raised a loud and angry sea ,</l>
     <l n="194">He stood and gazed , in wretched reverie ;</l>
     <l n="195">He heeded not the frost , the rain , the snow ;</l>
     <l n="196">Close by the sea he walk 'd alone and slow .</l>
     <l n="197">Sometimes his frame through many an hour he spread</l>
     <l n="198">Upon a tombstone , moveless as the dead ;</l>
     <l n="199">And , was there found a sad and silent place ,</l>
     <l n="200">There would he creep with slow and measured pace . 200</l>
     <l n="201">Then would he wander by the river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="202">And fix his eyes upon the falling tide ;</l>
     <l n="203">The deep dry ditch , the rushes in the fen ,</l>
     <l n="204">And mossy crag-pits were his lodgings then :</l>
     <l n="205">There , to his discontented thoughts a prey ,</l>
     <l n="206">The melancholy mortal pined away .</l>
     <l n="207">The neighb'ring poor at length began to speak</l>
     <l n="208">Of Abel 's ramblings — he 'd been gone a week ,</l>
     <l n="209">They knew not where ; and little care they took</l>
     <l n="210">For one so friendless and so poor to look ; 210</l>
     <l n="211">At last a stranger , in a pedler 's shed ,</l>
     <l n="212">Beheld him hanging — he had long been dead .</l>
     <l n="213">He left a paper , penn 'd at sundry times ,</l>
     <l n="214">Intitled thus — “ My Groanings and my Crimes ! ”</l>
     <l n="215">“ I was a christian man , and none could lay</l>
     <l n="216">Aught to my charge ; I walk 'd the narrow way :</l>
     <l n="217">All then was simple faith , serene and pure ,</l>
     <l n="218">My hope was steadfast and my prospects sure ;</l>
     <l n="219">Then was I tried by want and sickness sore , }</l>
     <l n="220">But these I clapp 'd my shield of faith before , 220 }</l>
     <l n="221">And cares and wants and man 's rebukes I bore . }</l>
     <l n="222">Alas ! new foes assail 'd me ; I was vain ,</l>
     <l n="223">They stung my pride and they confused my brain :</l>
     <l n="224">Oh ! these deluders ! with what glee they saw</l>
     <l n="225">Their simple dupe transgress the righteous law ;</l>
     <l n="226">‘ Twas joy to them to view that dreadful strife ,</l>
     <l n="227">When faith and frailty warr 'd for more than life ;</l>
     <l n="228">So with their pleasures they beguiled the heart ,</l>
     <l n="229">Then with their logic they allay 'd the smart ;</l>
     <l n="230">They proved ( so thought I then ) with reasons strong , 230</l>
     <l n="231">That no man 's feelings ever led him wrong ;</l>
     <l n="232">And thus I went , as on the varnish 'd ice ,</l>
     <l n="233">The smooth career of unbelief and vice .</l>
     <l n="234">Oft would the youths , with sprightly speech and bold ,</l>
     <l n="235">Their witty tales of naughty priests unfold ;</l>
     <l n="236">‘'Twas all a craft , ’ they said , ‘ a cunning trade ,</l>
     <l n="237">Not she the priests , but priests religion made : ’</l>
     <l n="238">So I believed ; ” — No , Abel ! to thy grief ,</l>
     <l n="239">So thou relinquish'dst all that was belief ;—</l>
     <l n="240">“ I grew as very flint , and when the rest 240</l>
     <l n="241">Laugh 'd at devotion , I enjoy 'd the jest ;</l>
     <l n="242">But this all vanish 'd like the morning-dew , }</l>
     <l n="243">When unemploy 'd , and poor again I grew ; }</l>
     <l n="244">Yea ! I was doubly poor , for I was wicked too . }</l>
     <l n="245">“ The mouse that trespass 'd and the treasure stole ,</l>
     <l n="246">Found his lean body fitted to the hole ;</l>
     <l n="247">Till , having fatted , he was forced to stay ,</l>
     <l n="248">And , fasting , starve his stolen bulk away .</l>
     <l n="249">Ah ! worse for me — grown poor , I yet remain</l>
     <l n="250">In sinful bonds , and pray and fast in vain . 250</l>
     <l n="251">“ At length I thought : although these friends of sin</l>
     <l n="252">Have spread their net and caught their prey therein ;</l>
     <l n="253">Though my hard heart could not for mercy call ,</l>
     <l n="254">Because , though great my grief , my faith was small ;</l>
     <l n="255">Yet , as the sick on skilful men rely ,</l>
     <l n="256">The soul diseased may to a doctor fly .</l>
     <l n="257">“ A famous one there was , whose skill had wrought</l>
     <l n="258">Cures past relief , and him the sinners sought ;</l>
     <l n="259">Numbers there were denied by mire and filth ,</l>
     <l n="260">Whom he recover 'd by his goodly tilth :— 260</l>
     <l n="261">‘ Come then , ’ I said , ‘ let me the man behold ,</l>
     <l n="262">And tell my case ; ’ — I saw him and I told .</l>
     <l n="263">“ With trembling voice , ‘ Oh ! reverend sir , ’ I said ,</l>
     <l n="264">‘ I once believed , and I was then misled ;</l>
     <l n="265">And now such doubts my sinful soul beset ,</l>
     <l n="266">I dare not say that I 'm a Christian yet ;</l>
     <l n="267">Canst thou , good sir , by thy superior skill ,</l>
     <l n="268">Inform my judgment and direct my will ?</l>
     <l n="269">Ah ! give thy cordial ; let my soul have rest ,</l>
     <l n="270">And be the outward man alone distress 'd ; 270</l>
     <l n="271">For at my state I tremble . ’ — ‘ Tremble more , ’</l>
     <l n="272">Said the good man , ‘ and then rejoice therefore ;</l>
     <l n="273">‘ Tis good to tremble ; prospects then are fair ,</l>
     <l n="274">When the lost soul is plunged in deep despair .</l>
     <l n="275">Once thou wert simply honest , just and pure ,</l>
     <l n="276">Whole , as thou thought'st , and never wish 'd a cure ;</l>
     <l n="277">Now thou hast plunged in folly , shame , disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="278">Now thou'rt an object meet for healing grace ;</l>
     <l n="279">No merit thine , no virtue , hope , belief ; }</l>
     <l n="280">Nothing hast thou , but misery , sin , and grief , 280 }</l>
     <l n="281">The best , the only titles to relief . ’ }</l>
     <l n="282">“ ‘ What must I do , ’ I said , ‘ my soul to free ? ’</l>
     <l n="283">‘ — Do nothing , man ; it will be done for thee . ’</l>
     <l n="284">‘ But must I not , my reverend guide , believe ? ’</l>
     <l n="285">‘ — If thou art call 'd , thou wilt the faith receive ; ’ —</l>
     <l n="286">‘ But I repent not . ’ — Angry he replied ,</l>
     <l n="287">‘ If thou art call 'd , thou needest nought beside ;</l>
     <l n="288">Attend on us , and if ‘ tis Heaven 's decree ,</l>
     <l n="289">The call will come — if not , ah ! wo for thee . ’</l>
     <l n="290">“ There then I waited , ever on the watch , 290</l>
     <l n="291">A spark of hope , a ray of light to catch ;</l>
     <l n="292">His words fell softly like the flakes of snow ,</l>
     <l n="293">But I could never find my heart o'erflow .</l>
     <l n="294">He cried aloud , till in the flock began</l>
     <l n="295">The sigh , the tear , as caught from man to man ;</l>
     <l n="296">They wept and they rejoiced , and there was I ,</l>
     <l n="297">Hard as a flint , and as the desert dry .</l>
     <l n="298">To me no tokens of the call would come ,</l>
     <l n="299">I felt my sentence and received my doom ;</l>
     <l n="300">But I complain 'd ;— ‘ Let thy repinings cease , 300 }</l>

   <p>In a periodical work for the month of June last , the preceding dialogue is pronounced to be a most abominable caricature , if meant to be applied to Calvinists in general , and greatly distorted , if designed for an individual . Now , the author in his preface has declared , that he takes not upon him the censure of any sect or society for their opinions ; and the lines themselves evidently point to an individual , whose sentiments they very fairly represent , without any distortion whatsoever . In a pamphlet entitled “ A Cordial for a Sin-despairing Soul , ” originally written by a teacher of religion , and lately re-published by another teacher of greater notoriety , the reader is informed that after he had full assurance of his salvation , the Spirit entered particularly into the subject with him ; and , among many other matters of like nature , assured him that “ his sins were fully and freely forgiven , as if they had never been committed : not for any act done by him , whether believing in Christ , or repenting of sin ; nor yet for the sorrows and miseries he endured , nor for any service he should be called upon in his militant state , but for his own name and for his glory 's sake<span type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span>, ” &amp; c. And the whole drift and tenour of the book is to the same purpose , viz . the uselessness of all religious duties , such as prayer , contrition , fasting , and good works : he shows the evil done by reading such books as the Whole Duty of Man , and the Practice of Piety ; and complains heavily of his relation , an Irish bishop , who wanted him to join with the household in family prayer : in fact , the whole work inculcates that sort of quietism which this dialogue alludes to , and that without any recommendation of attendance on the teachers of the Gospel , but rather holding forth encouragement to the supineness of man 's nature ; by the information that he in vain looks for acceptance by the employment of his talents , and that his hopes of glory are rather extinguished than raised by any application to the means of grace .</p>

     <l n="1">Old Peter Grimes made fishing his employ ; }</l>
     <l n="2">His wife he cabin 'd with him and his boy , }</l>
     <l n="3">And seem 'd that life laborious to enjoy . }</l>
     <l n="4">To town came quiet Peter with his fish ,</l>
     <l n="5">And had of all a civil word and wish .</l>
     <l n="6">He left his trade upon the sabbath-day ,</l>
     <l n="7">And took young Peter in his hand to pray ;</l>
     <l n="8">But soon the stubborn boy from care broke loose ,</l>
     <l n="9">At first refused , then added his abuse ;</l>
     <l n="10">His father 's love he scorn 'd , his power defied , 10</l>
     <l n="11">But , being drunk , wept sorely when he died .</l>
     <l n="12">Yes ! then he wept , and to his mind there came</l>
     <l n="13">Much of his conduct , and he felt the shame :—</l>
     <l n="14">How he had oft the good old man reviled ,</l>
     <l n="15">And never paid the duty of a child ;</l>
     <l n="16">How , when the father in his Bible read ,</l>
     <l n="17">He in contempt and anger left the shed ;</l>
     <l n="18">“ It is the word of life , ” the parent cried ;</l>
     <l n="19">— “ This is the life itself , ” the boy replied ;</l>
     <l n="20">And while old Peter in amazement stood , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Gave the hot spirit to his boiling blood ;—</l>
     <l n="22">How he , with oath and furious speech , began</l>
     <l n="23">To prove his freedom and assert the man ;</l>
     <l n="24">And when the parent check 'd his impious rage ,</l>
     <l n="25">How he had cursed the tyranny of age ;—</l>
     <l n="26">Nay , once had dealt the sacrilegious blow</l>
     <l n="27">On his bare head , and laid his parent low ;</l>
     <l n="28">The father groan 'd — “ If thou art old , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="29">“ And hast a son — thou wilt remember me ;</l>
     <l n="30">Thy mother left me in a happy time , 30</l>
     <l n="31">Thou kill'dst not her — Heav'n spares the double crime . ”</l>
     <l n="32">On an inn-settle , in his maudlin grief ,</l>
     <l n="33">This he revolved , and drank for his relief .</l>
     <l n="34">Now lived the youth in freedom , but debarr 'd</l>
     <l n="35">From constant pleasure , and he thought it hard ;</l>
     <l n="36">Hard that he could not every wish obey ,</l>
     <l n="37">But must awhile relinquish ale and play ;</l>
     <l n="38">Hard ! that he could not to his cards attend ,</l>
     <l n="39">But must acquire the money he would spend .</l>
     <l n="40">With greedy eye he look 'd on all he saw ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">He knew not justice , and he laugh 'd at law ;</l>
     <l n="42">On all he mark 'd he stretch 'd his ready hand ;</l>
     <l n="43">He fish 'd by water , and he filch 'd by land .</l>
     <l n="44">Oft in the night has Peter dropp 'd his oar ,</l>
     <l n="45">Fled from his boat and sought for prey on shore ;</l>
     <l n="46">Oft up the hedge-row glided , on his back }</l>
     <l n="47">Bearing the orchard 's produce in a sack , }</l>
     <l n="48">Or farm-yard load , tugg 'd fiercely from the stack ; }</l>
     <l n="49">And as these wrongs to greater numbers rose ,</l>
     <l n="50">The more he look 'd on all men as his foes . 50</l>
     <l n="51">He built a mud-wall 'd hovel , where he kept</l>
     <l n="52">His various wealth , and there he oft-times slept ;</l>
     <l n="53">But no success could please his cruel soul ,</l>
     <l n="54">He wish 'd for one to trouble and control ;</l>
     <l n="55">He wanted some obedient boy to stand</l>
     <l n="56">And bear the blow of his outrageous hand ;</l>
     <l n="57">And hoped to find in some propitious hour</l>
     <l n="58">A feeling creature subject to his power .</l>
     <l n="59">Peter had heard there were in London then —</l>
     <l n="60">Still have they being !— workhouse-clearing men , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Who , undisturb 'd by feelings just or kind ,</l>
     <l n="62">Would parish-boys to needy tradesmen bind ;</l>
     <l n="63">They in their want a trifling sum would take ,</l>
     <l n="64">And toiling slaves of piteous orphans make .</l>
     <l n="65">Such Peter sought , and , when a lad was found ,</l>
     <l n="66">The sum was dealt him , and the slave was bound .</l>
     <l n="67">Some few in town observed in Peter 's trap</l>
     <l n="68">A boy , with jacket blue and woollen cap ;</l>
     <l n="69">But none inquired how Peter used the rope ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or what the bruise , that made the stripling stoop ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">None could the ridges on his back behold ,</l>
     <l n="72">None sought him shiv'ring in the winter 's cold ;</l>
     <l n="73">None put the question — “ Peter , dost thou give</l>
     <l n="74">The boy his food ?— What , man ! the lad must live :</l>
     <l n="75">Consider , Peter , let the child have bread ,</l>
     <l n="76">He 'll serve thee better if he 's stroked and fed . ”</l>
     <l n="77">None reason 'd thus — and some , on hearing cries ,</l>
     <l n="78">Said calmly , “ Grimes is at his exercise . ”</l>
     <l n="79">Pinn 'd , beaten , cold , pinch 'd , threaten 'd , and abused —</l>
     <l n="80">His efforts punish 'd and his food refused — 80</l>
     <l n="81">Awake tormented — soon aroused from sleep —</l>
     <l n="82">Struck if he wept , and yet compell 'd to weep :</l>
     <l n="83">The trembling boy dropp 'd down and strove to pray ,</l>
     <l n="84">Received a blow , and trembling turn 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="85">Or sobb 'd and hid his piteous face ;— while he ,</l>
     <l n="86">The savage master , grinn 'd in horrid glee :</l>
     <l n="87">He 'd now the power he ever loved to show ,</l>
     <l n="88">A feeling being subject to his blow .</l>
     <l n="89">Thus lived the lad , in hunger , peril , pain ,</l>
     <l n="90">His tears despised , his supplications vain . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Compell 'd by fear to lie , by need to steal ,</l>
     <l n="92">His bed uneasy and unbless 'd his meal ,</l>
     <l n="93">For three sad years the boy his tortures bore ;</l>
     <l n="94">And then his pains and trials were no more .</l>
     <l n="95">“ How died he , Peter ? ” when the people said , }</l>
     <l n="96">He growl 'd — “ I found him lifeless in his bed ; ” }</l>
     <l n="97">Then tried for softer tone , and sigh 'd , “ Poor Sam is dead . ” }</l>
     <l n="98">Yet murmurs were there , and some questions ask 'd —</l>
     <l n="99">How he was fed , how punish 'd , and how task 'd ?</l>
     <l n="100">Much they suspected , but they little proved , 100</l>
     <l n="101">And Peter pass 'd untroubled and unmoved .</l>
     <l n="102">Another boy with equal ease was found ,</l>
     <l n="103">The money granted , and the victim bound ;</l>
     <l n="104">And what his fate ?— One night , it chanced he fell</l>
     <l n="105">From the boat 's mast and perish 'd in her well ,</l>
     <l n="106">Where fish were living kept , and where the boy</l>
     <l n="107">( So reason 'd men ) could not himself destroy .</l>
     <l n="108">“ Yes ! so it was , ” said Peter ; “ in his play ,</l>
     <l n="109">( For he was idle both by night and day ,)</l>
     <l n="110">He climb 'd the main-mast and then fell below ; ” — 110</l>
     <l n="111">Then show 'd his corpse and pointed to the blow ;—</l>
     <l n="112">“ What said the jury ? ” — They were long in doubt ;</l>
     <l n="113">But sturdy Peter faced the matter out :</l>
     <l n="114">So they dismiss 'd him , saying at the time ,</l>
     <l n="115">“ Keep fast your hatchway , when you 've boys who climb . ”</l>
     <l n="116">This hit the conscience , and he colour 'd more</l>
     <l n="117">Than for the closest questions put before .</l>
     <l n="118">Thus all his fears the verdict set aside ,</l>
     <l n="119">And at the slave-shop Peter still applied .</l>
     <l n="120">Then came a boy , of manners soft and mild — 120</l>
     <l n="121">Our seamen 's wives with grief beheld the child ;</l>
     <l n="122">All thought ( the poor themselves ) that he was one</l>
     <l n="123">Of gentle blood , some noble sinner 's son ,</l>
     <l n="124">Who had , belike , deceived some humble maid ,</l>
     <l n="125">Whom he had first seduced and then betray 'd .—</l>
     <l n="126">However this , he seem 'd a gracious lad ,</l>
     <l n="127">In grief submissive and with patience sad .</l>
     <l n="128">Passive he labour 'd , till his slender frame</l>
     <l n="129">Bent with his loads , and he at length was lame ;—</l>
     <l n="130">Strange that a frame so weak could bear so long 130</l>
     <l n="131">The grossest insult and the foulest wrong ;</l>
     <l n="132">But there were causes — in the town they gave</l>
     <l n="133">Fire , food , and comfort , to the gentle slave ;</l>
     <l n="134">And though stern Peter , with a cruel hand ,</l>
     <l n="135">And knotted rope , enforced the rude command ,</l>
     <l n="136">Yet he consider 'd what he 'd lately felt ,</l>
     <l n="137">And his vile blows with selfish pity dealt .</l>
     <l n="138">One day such draughts the cruel fisher made</l>
     <l n="139">He could not vend them in his borough-trade ,</l>
     <l n="140">But sail 'd for London-mart ; the boy was ill , 140</l>
     <l n="141">But ever humbled to his master 's will ;</l>
     <l n="142">And on the river , where they smoothly sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="143">He strove with terror and awhile prevail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="144">But , new to danger on the angry sea ,</l>
     <l n="145">He clung affrighten 'd to his master 's knee .</l>
     <l n="146">The boat grew leaky and the wind was strong ,</l>
     <l n="147">Rough was the passage and the time was long ;</l>
     <l n="148">His liquor fail 'd , and Peter 's wrath arose —</l>
     <l n="149">No more is known — the rest we must suppose ,</l>
     <l n="150">Or learn of Peter ;— Peter says , he “ spied 150 }</l>
     <l n="151">The stripling 's danger and for harbour tried ; }</l>
     <l n="152">Meantime the fish , and then th ’ apprentice died . ” }</l>
     <l n="153">The pitying women raised a clamour round ,</l>
     <l n="154">And weeping said , “ Thou hast thy ‘ prentice drown 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="155">Now the stern man was summon 'd to the hall ,</l>
     <l n="156">To tell his tale before the burghers all .</l>
     <l n="157">He gave th ’ account ; profess 'd the lad he loved ,</l>
     <l n="158">And kept his brazen features all unmoved .</l>
     <l n="159">The mayor himself with tone severe replied ,—</l>
     <l n="160">“ Henceforth with thee shall never boy abide ; 160</l>
     <l n="161">Hire thee a freeman , whom thou durst not beat ,</l>
     <l n="162">But who , in thy despite , will sleep and eat .</l>
     <l n="163">Free thou art now !— again shouldst thou appear ,</l>
     <l n="164">Thou'lt find thy sentence , like thy soul , severe . ”</l>
     <l n="165">Alas ! for Peter not a helping hand ,</l>
     <l n="166">So was he hated , could he now command ;</l>
     <l n="167">Alone he row 'd his boat ; alone he cast</l>
     <l n="168">His nets beside , or made his anchor fast ;</l>
     <l n="169">To hold a rope or hear a curse was none —</l>
     <l n="170">He toil 'd and rail 'd ; he groan 'd and swore alone . 170</l>
     <l n="171">Thus by himself compell 'd to live each day ,</l>
     <l n="172">To wait for certain hours the tide 's delay ;</l>
     <l n="173">At the same times the same dull views to see ,</l>
     <l n="174">The bounding marsh-bank and the blighted tree ;</l>
     <l n="175">The water only when the tides were high ;</l>
     <l n="176">When low , the mud half-cover 'd and half-dry ;</l>
     <l n="177">The sun-burnt tar that blisters on the planks ,</l>
     <l n="178">And bank-side stakes in their uneven ranks ;</l>
     <l n="179">Heaps of entangled weeds that slowly float ,</l>
     <l n="180">As the tide rolls by the impeded boat . 180</l>
     <l n="181">When tides were neap , and , in the sultry day ,</l>
     <l n="182">Through the tall bounding mud-banks made their way ,</l>
     <l n="183">Which on each side rose swelling , and below</l>
     <l n="184">The dark warm flood ran silently and slow :</l>
     <l n="185">There anchoring , Peter chose from man to hide , }</l>
     <l n="186">There hang his head , and view the lazy tide }</l>
     <l n="187">In its hot slimy channel slowly glide ; }</l>
     <l n="188">Where the small eels that left the deeper way</l>
     <l n="189">For the warm shore , within the shallows play ;</l>
     <l n="190">Where gaping muscles , left upon the mud , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Slope their slow passage to the fallen flood :—</l>
     <l n="192">Here dull and hopeless he 'd lie down and trace</l>
     <l n="193">How sidelong crabs had scrawl 'd their crooked race ;</l>
     <l n="194">Or sadly listen to the tuneless cry</l>
     <l n="195">Of fishing gull or clanging golden-eye ;</l>
     <l n="196">What time the sea-birds to the marsh would come , }</l>
     <l n="197">And the loud bittern , from the bull-rush home , }</l>
     <l n="198">Gave from the salt-ditch side the bellowing boom . }</l>
     <l n="199">He nursed the feelings these dull scenes produce ,</l>
     <l n="200">And loved to stop beside the opening sluice ; 200</l>
     <l n="201">Where the small stream , confined in narrow bound ,</l>
     <l n="202">Ran with a dull , unvaried , sadd'ning sound ;</l>
     <l n="203">Where all presented to the eye or ear</l>
     <l n="204">Oppress 'd the soul with misery , grief , and fear .</l>
     <l n="205">Besides these objects , there were places three ,</l>
     <l n="206">Which Peter seem 'd with certain dread to see ;</l>
     <l n="207">When he drew near them he would turn from each ,</l>
     <l n="208">And loudly whistle till he pass 'd the reach<span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>.</l>
     <l n="209">A change of scene to him brought no relief ;</l>
     <l n="210">In town , ‘ twas plain , men took him for a thief : 210</l>
     <l n="211">The sailors ’ wives would stop him in the street ,</l>
     <l n="212">And say , “ Now , Peter , thou'st no boy to beat ; ”</l>
     <l n="213">Infants at play , when they perceived him , ran ,</l>
     <l n="214">Warning each other — “ That 's the wicked man ; ”</l>
     <l n="215">He growl 'd an oath , and in an angry tone</l>
     <l n="216">Cursed the whole place and wish 'd to be alone .</l>
     <l n="217">Alone he was , the same dull scenes in view ,</l>
     <l n="218">And still more gloomy in his sight they grew .</l>
     <l n="219">Though man he hated , yet employ 'd alone</l>
     <l n="220">At bootless labour , he would swear and groan , 220</l>
     <l n="221">Cursing the shoals that glided by the spot ,</l>
     <l n="222">And gulls that caught them when his arts could not .</l>
     <l n="223">Cold nervous tremblings shook his sturdy frame ,</l>
     <l n="224">And strange disease — he could n't say the name ;</l>
     <l n="225">Wild were his dreams , and oft he rose in fright ,</l>
     <l n="226">Waked by his view of horrors in the night —</l>
     <l n="227">Horrors that would the sternest minds amaze ,</l>
     <l n="228">Horrors that demons might be proud to raise ;</l>
     <l n="229">And , though he felt forsaken , grieved at heart , }</l>
     <l n="230">To think he lived from all mankind apart ; 230 }</l>
     <l n="231">Yet , if a man approach 'd , in terrors he would start . }</l>
     <l n="232">A winter pass 'd since Peter saw the town ,</l>
     <l n="233">And summer-lodgers were again come down ;</l>
     <l n="234">These , idly curious , with their glasses spied</l>
     <l n="235">The ships in bay as anchored for the tide —</l>
     <l n="236">The river 's craft — the bustle of the quay —</l>
     <l n="237">And sea-port views , which landmen love to see .</l>
     <l n="238">One , up the river , had a man and boat</l>
     <l n="239">Seen day by day , now anchor 'd , now afloat ;</l>
     <l n="240">Fisher he seem 'd , yet used no net nor hook ; 240 }</l>
     <l n="241">Of sea-fowl swimming by no heed he took , }</l>
     <l n="242">But on the gliding waves still fix 'd his lazy look ; }</l>
     <l n="243">At certain stations he would view the stream ,</l>
     <l n="244">As if he stood bewilder 'd in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="245">Or that some power had chain 'd him for a time ,</l>
     <l n="246">To feel a curse or meditate on crime .</l>
     <l n="247">This known , some curious , some in pity went ,</l>
     <l n="248">And others question 'd — “ Wretch , dost thou repent ? ”</l>
     <l n="249">He heard , he trembled , and in fear resign 'd</l>
     <l n="250">His boat ; new terror fill 'd his restless mind ; 250</l>
     <l n="251">Furious he grew , and up the country ran ,</l>
     <l n="252">And there they seized him — a distemper 'd man .—</l>
     <l n="253">Him we received ; and to a parish-bed ,</l>
     <l n="254">Follow 'd and cursed , the groaning man was led .</l>
     <l n="255">Here when they saw him , whom they used to shun ,</l>
     <l n="256">A lost , lone man , so harass 'd and undone ,</l>
     <l n="257">Our gentle females , ever prompt to feel ,</l>
     <l n="258">Perceived compassion on their anger steal ;</l>
     <l n="259">His crimes they could not from their memories blot ;</l>
     <l n="260">But they were grieved , and trembled at his lot . 260</l>
     <l n="261">A priest too came , to whom his words are told ;</l>
     <l n="262">And all the signs they shudder 'd to behold .</l>
     <l n="263">“ Look ! look ! ” they cried ; “ his limbs with horror shake , }</l>
     <l n="264">And as he grinds his teeth , what noise they make ! }</l>
     <l n="265">How glare his angry eyes , and yet he 's not awake . }</l>
     <l n="266">See ! what cold drops upon his forehead stand ,</l>
     <l n="267">And how he clenches that broad bony hand . ”</l>
     <l n="268">The priest , attending , found he spoke at times</l>
     <l n="269">As one alluding to his fears and crimes :</l>
     <l n="270">“ It was the fall , ” he mutter 'd , “ I can show 270</l>
     <l n="271">The manner how — I never struck a blow ; ” —</l>
     <l n="272">And then aloud — “ Unhand me , free my chain ;</l>
     <l n="273">On oath , he fell — it struck him to the brain ;—</l>
     <l n="274">Why ask my father ?— that old man will swear</l>
     <l n="275">Against my life ; besides , he was n't there ;—</l>
     <l n="276">What , all agreed ?— Am I to die to-day ?—</l>
     <l n="277">My Lord , in mercy , give me time to pray . ”</l>
     <l n="278">Then , as they watch 'd him , calmer he became ,</l>
     <l n="279">And grew so weak he could n't move his frame ,</l>
     <l n="280">But murmuring spake — while they could see and hear 280</l>
     <l n="281">The start of terror and the groan of fear ;</l>
     <l n="282">See the large dew-beads on his forehead rise ,</l>
     <l n="283">And the cold death-drop glaze his sunken eyes ;</l>
     <l n="284">Nor yet he died , but with unwonted force</l>
     <l n="285">Seem 'd with some fancied being to discourse .</l>
     <l n="286">He knew not us , or with accustom 'd art</l>
     <l n="287">He hid the knowledge , yet exposed his heart ;</l>
     <l n="288">‘ Twas part confession and the rest defence ,</l>
     <l n="289">A madman 's tale , with gleams of waking sense .</l>
     <l n="290">“ I 'll tell you all , ” he said ; “ the very day 290</l>
     <l n="291">When the old man first placed them in my way :</l>
     <l n="292">My father 's spirit — he who always tried</l>
     <l n="293">To give me trouble , when he lived and died —</l>
     <l n="294">When he was gone , he could not be content</l>
     <l n="295">To see my days in painful labour spent ,</l>
     <l n="296">But would appoint his meetings , and he made</l>
     <l n="297">Me watch at these , and so neglect my trade .</l>
     <l n="298">“ ‘ Twas one hot noon , all silent , still , serene ;</l>
     <l n="299">No living being had I lately seen ;</l>
     <l n="300">I paddled up and down and dipp 'd my net , 300</l>
     <l n="301">But ( such his pleasure ) I could nothing get —</l>
     <l n="302">A father 's pleasure , when his toil was done ,</l>
     <l n="303">To plague and torture thus an only son !</l>
     <l n="304">And so I sat and look 'd upon the stream ,</l>
     <l n="305">How it ran on , and felt as in a dream —</l>
     <l n="306">But dream it was not ; no !— I fix 'd my eyes</l>
     <l n="307">On the mid stream and saw the spirits rise ;</l>
     <l n="308">I saw my father on the water stand ,</l>
     <l n="309">And held a thin pale boy in either hand ;</l>
     <l n="310">And there they glided ghastly on the top 310</l>
     <l n="311">Of the salt flood , and never touch 'd a drop .</l>
     <l n="312">I would have struck them , but they knew th ’ intent ,</l>
     <l n="313">And smiled upon the oar , and down they went .</l>
     <l n="314">“ Now , from that day , whenever I began</l>
     <l n="315">To dip my net , there stood the hard old man —</l>
     <l n="316">He and those boys ; I humbled me and pray 'd</l>
     <l n="317">They would be gone ;— they heeded not , but stay 'd .</l>
     <l n="318">Nor could I turn , nor would the boat go by , }</l>
     <l n="319">But gazing on the spirits , there was I ; }</l>
     <l n="320">They bade me leap to death , but I was loth to die . 320 }</l>
     <l n="321">And every day , as sure as day arose ,</l>
     <l n="322">Would these three spirits meet me ere the close ;</l>
     <l n="323">To hear and mark them daily was my doom ,</l>
     <l n="324">And ‘ Come , ’ they said , with weak , sad voices , ‘ come . ’</l>
     <l n="325">To row away with all my strength I try 'd ; }</l>
     <l n="326">But there were they , hard by me in the tide , }</l>
     <l n="327">The three unbodied forms — and ‘ Come , ’ still ‘ come , ’ they cried . }</l>
     <l n="328">“ Fathers should pity — but this old man shook</l>
     <l n="329">His hoary locks , and froze me by a look .</l>
     <l n="330">Thrice , when I struck them , through the water came 330</l>
     <l n="331">A hollow groan that weakened all my frame ;</l>
     <l n="332">‘ Father ! ’ said I , ‘ have mercy ! ’ — He replied ,</l>
     <l n="333">I know not what — the angry spirit lied ,—</l>
     <l n="334">‘ Didst thou not draw thy knife ? ’ said he ;— ‘ Twas true ,</l>
     <l n="335">But I had pity and my arm withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="336">He cried for mercy which I kindly gave ,</l>
     <l n="337">But he has no compassion in his grave .</l>
     <l n="338">“ There were three places , where they ever rose ;—</l>
     <l n="339">The whole long river has not such as those —</l>
     <l n="340">Places accursed , where , if a man remain , 340</l>
     <l n="341">He 'll see the things which strike him to the brain ;</l>
     <l n="342">And there they made me on my paddle lean ,</l>
     <l n="343">And look at them for hours — accursed scene !</l>
     <l n="344">When they would glide to that smooth eddy-space ,</l>
     <l n="345">Then bid me leap and join them in the place ;</l>
     <l n="346">And at my groans each little villain sprite</l>
     <l n="347">Enjoy 'd my pains and vanish 'd in delight .</l>
     <l n="348">“ In one fierce summer-day , when my poor brain</l>
     <l n="349">Was burning hot and cruel was my pain ,</l>
     <l n="350">Then came this father-foe ; and there he stood 350</l>
     <l n="351">With his two boys again upon the flood ;</l>
     <l n="352">There was more mischief in their eyes , more glee</l>
     <l n="353">In their pale faces when they glared at me .</l>
     <l n="354">Still did they force me on the oar to rest ,</l>
     <l n="355">And when they saw me fainting and oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="356">He , with his hand , the old man , scoop 'd the flood ,</l>
     <l n="357">And there came flame about him , mix 'd with blood ;</l>
     <l n="358">He bade me stoop and look upon the place ,</l>
     <l n="359">Then flung the hot-red liquor in my face ;</l>
     <l n="360">Burning it blazed , and then I roar 'd for pain , 360</l>
     <l n="361">I thought the demons would have turn 'd my brain .</l>
     <l n="362">“ Still there they stood , and forced me to behold</l>
     <l n="363">A place of horrors — they cannot be told —</l>
     <l n="364">Where the flood open 'd , there I heard the shriek</l>
     <l n="365">Of tortured guilt no earthly tongue can speak :</l>
     <l n="366">‘ All days alike ! for ever ! ’ did they say ,</l>
     <l n="367">‘ And unremitted torments every day ! ’ —</l>
     <l n="368">Yes , so they said ; ” — but here he ceased and gazed</l>
     <l n="369">On all around , affrighten 'd and amazed ;</l>
     <l n="370">And still he tried to speak , and look 'd in dread 370</l>
     <l n="371">Of frighten 'd females gathering round his bed ;</l>
     <l n="372">Then dropp 'd exhausted and appear 'd at rest ,</l>
     <l n="373">Till the strong foe the vital powers possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="374">Then with an inward , broken voice he cried ,</l>
     <l n="375">“ Again they come , ” and mutter 'd as he died .</l>

     <l n="17">Bear to be drawn by ruthless arms away</l>
     <l n="18">To the vile nuisance of a noisome room ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where only insolence and misery come ?</l>
     <l n="20">( Save that the curious will by chance appear , 20</l>

     <l n="22">To a damp prison , where the very sight</l>
     <l n="23">Of the warm sun is favour and not right ;</l>
     <l n="24">Where all we hear or see the feelings shock ,</l>
     <l n="25">The oath and groan , the fetter and the lock ?</l>
     <l n="26">Who could bear this and live ?— Oh ! many a year</l>
     <l n="27">All this is borne , and miseries more severe ;</l>
     <l n="28">And some there are , familiar with the scene ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who live in mirth , though few become serene .</l>
     <l n="30">Far as I might the inward man perceive , 30</l>
     <l n="31">There was a constant effort — not to grieve ;</l>
     <l n="32">Not to despair , for better days would come ,</l>
     <l n="33">And the freed debtor smile again at home ;</l>
     <l n="34">Subdued his habits , he may peace regain ,</l>
     <l n="35">And bless the woes that were not sent in vain .</l>
     <l n="36">Thus might we class the debtors here confined ,</l>

     <l n="38">Here are the guilty race , who mean to live</l>
     <l n="39">On credit , that credulity will give ;</l>
     <l n="40">Who purchase , conscious they can never pay ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Who know their fate , and traffic to betray ;</l>
     <l n="42">On whom no pity , fear , remorse , prevail ,</l>
     <l n="43">Their aim a statute , their resource a jail ;—</l>
     <l n="44">These as the public spoilers we regard ;</l>
     <l n="45">No dun so harsh , no creditor so hard .</l>
     <l n="46">A second kind are they , who truly strive</l>
     <l n="47">To keep their sinking credit long alive ;</l>
     <l n="48">Success , nay prudence , they may want , but yet</l>
     <l n="49">They would be solvent , and deplore a debt ;</l>
     <l n="50">All means they use , to all expedients run , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And are by slow , sad steps , at last undone .</l>
     <l n="52">Justly , perhaps , you blame their want of skill ,</l>
     <l n="53">But mourn their feelings and absolve their will .</l>
     <l n="54">There is a debtor , who his trifling all</l>
     <l n="55">Spreads in a shop ; it would not fill a stall :</l>
     <l n="56">There at one window his temptation lays ,</l>
     <l n="57">And in new modes disposes and displays .</l>
     <l n="58">Above the door you shall his name behold ,</l>
     <l n="59">And what he vends in ample letters told ,</l>
     <l n="60">The words repository , warehouse , all 60</l>
     <l n="61">He uses to enlarge concerns so small .</l>
     <l n="62">He to his goods assigns some beauty 's name ,</l>
     <l n="63">Then in her reign , and hopes they 'll share her fame ;</l>
     <l n="64">And talks of credit , commerce , traffic , trade ,</l>
     <l n="65">As one important by their profit made ;</l>
     <l n="66">But who can paint the vacancy , the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="67">And spare dimensions of one backward room ?</l>
     <l n="68">Wherein he dines , if so ‘ tis fit to speak ,</l>
     <l n="69">Of one day 's herring and the morrow 's steak ;</l>
     <l n="70">An anchorite in diet , all his care 70</l>
     <l n="71">Is to display his stock and vend his ware .</l>
     <l n="72">Long waiting hopeless , then he tries to meet</l>
     <l n="73">A kinder fortune in a distant street ;</l>
     <l n="74">There he again displays , increasing yet</l>
     <l n="75">Corroding sorrow and consuming debt :</l>
     <l n="76">Alas ! he wants the requisites to rise —</l>
     <l n="77">The true connexions , the availing ties ;</l>
     <l n="78">They who proceed on certainties advance ;</l>
     <l n="79">These are not times when men prevail by chance .</l>
     <l n="80">But still he tries , till , after years of pain , 80</l>
     <l n="81">He finds , with anguish , he has tried in vain .</l>
     <l n="82">Debtors are these on whom ‘ tis hard to press ,</l>
     <l n="83">‘ Tis base , impolitic , and merciless .</l>
     <l n="84">To these we add a miscellaneous kind ,</l>
     <l n="85">By pleasure , pride , and indolence confined ;</l>
     <l n="86">Those whom no calls , no warnings could divert ,</l>
     <l n="87">The unexperienced and the inexpert ;</l>
     <l n="88">The builder , idler , schemer , gamester , sot —</l>
     <l n="89">The follies different , but the same their lot ;</l>
     <l n="90">Victims of horses , lasses , drinking , dice , 90</l>
     <l n="91">Of every passion , humour , whim , and vice .</l>
     <l n="92">See that sad merchant , who but yesterday</l>
     <l n="93">Had a vast household in command and pay ;</l>
     <l n="94">He now entreats permission to employ</l>
     <l n="95">A boy he needs , and then entreats the boy .</l>
     <l n="96">And there sits one , improvident but kind ,</l>
     <l n="97">Bound for a friend , whom honour could not bind ;</l>
     <l n="98">Sighing , he speaks to any who appear ,</l>
     <l n="99">“ A treach'rous friend — ‘ twas that which sent me here :</l>
     <l n="100">I was too kind — I thought I could depend 100</l>
     <l n="101">On his bare word — he was a treach'rous friend . ”</l>
     <l n="102">A female too !— it is to her a home ;</l>
     <l n="103">She came before — and she again will come .</l>
     <l n="104">Her friends have pity ; when their anger drops ,</l>
     <l n="105">They take her home ;— she 's tried her schools and shops —</l>
     <l n="106">Plan after plan ;— but fortune would not mend , }</l>
     <l n="107">She to herself was still the treach'rous friend ; }</l>
     <l n="108">And wheresoe'er began , all here was sure to end . }</l>
     <l n="109">And there she sits as thoughtless and as gay , }</l>
     <l n="110">As if she 'd means , or not a debt to pay — 110 }</l>
     <l n="111">Or knew to-morrow she 'd be call 'd away — }</l>
     <l n="112">Or felt a shilling and could dine to-day . }</l>
     <l n="113">While thus observing , I began to trace</l>
     <l n="114">The sober 'd features of a well-known face —</l>
     <l n="115">Looks once familiar , manners form 'd to please ,</l>
     <l n="116">And all illumined by a heart at ease .</l>
     <l n="117">But fraud and flattery ever claim 'd a part</l>
     <l n="118">( Still unresisted ) of that easy heart ;</l>
     <l n="119">But he at length beholds me — “ Ah ! my friend !</l>
     <l n="120">And have thy pleasures this unlucky end ? ” 120</l>
     <l n="121">“ Too sure , ” he said , and , smiling as he sigh 'd :</l>
     <l n="122">“ I went astray , though prudence seem 'd my guide ;</l>
     <l n="123">All she proposed I in my heart approved ,</l>
     <l n="124">And she was honour 'd , but my pleasure loved —</l>
     <l n="125">Pleasure , the mistress to whose arms I fled ,</l>
     <l n="126">From wife-like lectures angry prudence read .</l>
     <l n="127">“ Why speak the madness of a life like mine ,</l>
     <l n="128">The powers of beauty , novelty , and wine ?</l>
     <l n="129">Why paint the wanton smile , the venal vow ,</l>
     <l n="130">Or friends whose worth I can appreciate now ? 130</l>
     <l n="131">“ Oft I perceived my fate , and then would say ,</l>
     <l n="132">‘ I 'll think to-morrow , I must live to-day : ’</l>
     <l n="133">So am I here — I own the laws are just —</l>
     <l n="134">And here , where thought is painful , think I must .</l>
     <l n="135">But speech is pleasant ; this discourse with thee</l>
     <l n="136">Brings to my mind the sweets of liberty ;</l>
     <l n="137">Breaks on the sameness of the place , and gives</l>
     <l n="138">The doubtful heart conviction that it lives ,</l>

     <l n="144">Pinch 'd through neglect or turbid by disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="145">When in these wasting forms affliction stood</l>
     <l n="146">In my afflicted view , it chill 'd my blood ;—</l>
     <l n="147">And forth I rush 'd , a quick retreat to make ,</l>
     <l n="148">Till a loud laugh proclaim 'd the dire mistake .</l>
     <l n="149">But when the groan had settled to a sigh ;</l>
     <l n="150">When gloom became familiar to the eye ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">When I perceive how others seem to rest ,</l>
     <l n="152">With every evil rankling in my breast —</l>
     <l n="153">Led by example , I put on the man ,</l>

     <l n="211">With death before her , and her fate in view ,</l>
     <l n="212">Unsated vengeance in her bosom grew ;</l>
     <l n="213">Sullen she was and threat'ning ; in her eye</l>
     <l n="214">Glared the stern triumph that she dared to die ;</l>
     <l n="215">But first a being in the world must leave —</l>
     <l n="216">‘ Twas once reproach ; ‘ twas now a short reprieve .</l>
     <l n="217">She was a pauper bound , who early gave</l>
     <l n="218">Her mind to vice , and doubly was a slave ;</l>
     <l n="219">Upbraided , beaten , held by rough control ,</l>
     <l n="220">Revenge sustain 'd , inspired , and fill 'd her soul . 220</l>
     <l n="221">She fired a full-stored barn , confess 'd the fact ,</l>
     <l n="222">And laugh 'd at law and justified the act .</l>
     <l n="223">Our gentle vicar tried his powers in vain ,</l>
     <l n="224">She answer 'd not , or answer 'd with disdain ;</l>
     <l n="225">Th ’ approaching fate she heard without a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="226">And neither cared to live nor fear 'd to die .</l>
     <l n="227">Not so he felt , who with her was to pay</l>
     <l n="228">The forfeit , life — with dread he view 'd the day ,</l>
     <l n="229">And that short space which yet for him remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="230">Till with his limbs his faculties were chain 'd . 230</l>
     <l n="231">He paced his narrow bounds some ease to find ,</l>
     <l n="232">But found it not ,— no comfort reached his mind .</l>
     <l n="233">Each sense was palsied ; when he tasted food ,</l>
     <l n="234">He sigh 'd and said , “ Enough — ‘ tis very good . ”</l>
     <l n="235">Since his dread sentence , nothing seem 'd to be</l>
     <l n="236">As once it was — he seeing could not see ,</l>
     <l n="237">Nor hearing , hear aright ;— when first , I came</l>
     <l n="238">Within his view , I fancied there was shame ,</l>
     <l n="239">I judged , resentment ; I mistook the air —</l>
     <l n="240">These fainter passions live not with despair , 240</l>
     <l n="241">Or but exist and die ;— Hope , fear , and love ,</l>
     <l n="242">Joy , doubt , and hate , may other spirits move ,</l>
     <l n="243">But touch not his , who every waking hour</l>
     <l n="244">Has one fix 'd dread , and always feels its power .</l>
     <l n="245">“ But will not mercy ? ” — No ! she cannot plead</l>
     <l n="246">For such an outrage ;— ‘ twas a cruel deed :</l>
     <l n="247">He stopp 'd a timid traveller ;— to his breast ,</l>
     <l n="248">With oaths and curses , was the danger press 'd :—</l>
     <l n="249">No ! he must suffer ; pity we may find</l>
     <l n="250">For one man 's pangs , but must not wrong mankind . 250</l>
     <l n="251">Still I behold him , every thought employ 'd</l>
     <l n="252">On one dire view !— all others are destroy 'd ;</l>
     <l n="253">This makes his features ghastly , gives the tone</l>
     <l n="254">Of his few words resemblance to a groan .</l>
     <l n="255">He takes his tasteless food , and , when ‘ tis done ,</l>
     <l n="256">Counts up his meals , now lessen 'd by that one ;</l>
     <l n="257">For expectation is on time intent ,</l>
     <l n="258">Whether he brings us joy or punishment .</l>
     <l n="259">Yes ! e'en in sleep the impressions all remain ;</l>
     <l n="260">He hears the sentence and he feels the chain ; 260</l>
     <l n="261">He sees the judge and jury , when he shakes ,</l>
     <l n="262">And loudly cries , “ Not guilty , ” and awakes .</l>
     <l n="263">Then chilling tremblings o'er his body creep ,</l>
     <l n="264">Till worn-out nature is compell 'd to sleep .</l>
     <l n="265">Now comes the dream again ; it shows each scene ,</l>
     <l n="266">With each small circumstance that comes between —</l>
     <l n="267">The call to suffering and the very deed —</l>
     <l n="268">There crowds go with him , follow , and precede ;</l>
     <l n="269">Some heartless shout , some pity , all condemn ,</l>
     <l n="270">While he in fancied envy looks at them . 270</l>
     <l n="271">He seems the place for that sad act to see ,</l>
     <l n="272">And dreams the very thirst which then will be ;</l>
     <l n="273">A priest attends — it seems , the one he knew</l>
     <l n="274">In his best days , beneath whose care he grew .</l>
     <l n="275">At this his terrors take a sudden flight ,</l>
     <l n="276">He sees his native village with delight ;</l>
     <l n="277">The house , the chamber , where he once array 'd</l>
     <l n="278">His youthful person ; where he knelt and pray 'd .</l>
     <l n="279">Then too the comforts he enjoy 'd at home ,</l>
     <l n="280">The days of joy ; the joys themselves are come — 280</l>
     <l n="281">The hours of innocence — the timid look</l>
     <l n="282">Of his loved maid , when first her hand he took</l>
     <l n="283">And told his hope ; her trembling joy appears ,</l>
     <l n="284">Her forced reserve and his retreating fears .</l>
     <l n="285">All now is present ;— ‘ tis a moment 's gleam</l>
     <l n="286">Of former sunshine — stay , delightful dream !</l>
     <l n="287">Let him within his pleasant garden walk ,</l>
     <l n="288">Give him her arm , of blessings let them talk .</l>
     <l n="289">Yes ! all are with him now , and all the while</l>
     <l n="290">Life 's early prospects and his Fanny 's smile : 290</l>
     <l n="291">Then come his sister and his village-friend ,</l>
     <l n="292">And he will now the sweetest moments spend</l>
     <l n="293">Life has to yield ;— no ! never will he find</l>
     <l n="294">Again on earth such pleasure in his mind :</l>
     <l n="295">He goes through shrubby walks these friends among ,</l>
     <l n="296">Love in their looks and honour on the tongue ;</l>
     <l n="297">Nay , there 's a charm beyond what nature shows ,</l>
     <l n="298">The bloom is softer and more sweetly grows ;—</l>
     <l n="299">Pierced by no crime , and urged by no desire</l>
     <l n="300">For more than true and honest hearts require , 300</l>
     <l n="301">They feel the calm delight , and thus proceed</l>
     <l n="302">Through the green lane — then linger in the mead —</l>
     <l n="303">Stray o'er the heath in all its purple bloom —</l>
     <l n="304">And pluck the blossom where the wild bees hum ;</l>
     <l n="305">Then through the broomy bound with ease they pass ,</l>
     <l n="306">And press the sandy sheep-walk 's slender grass ,</l>
     <l n="307">Where dwarfish flowers among the gorse are spread ,</l>
     <l n="308">And the lamb browses by the linnet 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="309">Then ‘ cross the bounding brook they make their way</l>
     <l n="310">O'er its rough bridge — and there behold the bay !— 310</l>
     <l n="311">The ocean smiling to the fervid sun —</l>
     <l n="312">The waves that faintly fall and slowly run —</l>
     <l n="313">The ships at distance and the boats at hand ;</l>
     <l n="314">And now they walk upon the sea-side sand ,</l>
     <l n="315">Counting the number and what kind they be ,</l>
     <l n="316">Ships softly sinking in the sleepy sea ;</l>
     <l n="317">Now arm in arm , now parted , they behold</l>
     <l n="318">The glitt'ring waters on the shingles roll 'd ;</l>
     <l n="319">The timid girls , half dreading their design ,</l>
     <l n="320">Dip the small foot in the retarded brine , 320</l>
     <l n="321">And search for crimson weeds , which spreading flow ,</l>
     <l n="322">Or lie like pictures on the sand below ;</l>
     <l n="323">With all those bright red pebbles that the sun</l>
     <l n="324">Through the small waves so softly shines upon ;</l>
     <l n="325">And those live lucid jellies which the eye</l>
     <l n="326">Delights to trace as they swim glitt'ring by :</l>
     <l n="327">Pearl-shells and rubied star-fish they admire ,</l>
     <l n="328">And will arrange above the parlour-fire ,—</l>
     <l n="329">Tokens of bliss !— “ Oh ! horrible ! a wave</l>
     <l n="330">Roars as it rises — save me , Edward ! save ! ” 330</l>
     <l n="331">She cries — Alas ! the watchman on his way</l>
     <l n="332">Calls and lets in — truth , terror , and the day !</l>

     <l n="1">To every class we have a school assign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2">Rules for all ranks and food for every mind ;</l>
     <l n="3">Yet one there is , that small regard to rule</l>
     <l n="4">Or study pays , and still is deem 'd a school :</l>
     <l n="5">That , where a deaf , poor , patient widow sits ,</l>
     <l n="6">And awes some thirty infants as she knits ;</l>
     <l n="7">Infants of humble , busy wives , who pay</l>
     <l n="8">Some trifling price for freedom through the day .</l>
     <l n="9">At this good matron 's hut the children meet ,</l>
     <l n="10">Who thus becomes the mother of the street . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Her room is small , they cannot widely stray —</l>
     <l n="12">Her threshold high , they cannot run away ;</l>
     <l n="13">Though deaf , she sees the rebel-heroes shout ;—</l>
     <l n="14">Though lame , her white rod nimbly walks about ;</l>
     <l n="15">With band of yarn she keeps offenders in ,</l>
     <l n="16">And to her gown the sturdiest rogue can pin .</l>
     <l n="17">Aided by these , and spells , and tell-tale birds ,</l>
     <l n="18">Her power they dread and reverence her words .</l>
     <l n="19">To learning 's second seats we now proceed ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where humming students gilded primers read ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Or books with letters large and pictures gay ,</l>
     <l n="22">To make their reading but a kind of play —</l>
     <l n="23">“ Reading made Easy , ” so the titles tell ;</l>
     <l n="24">But they who read must first begin to spell .</l>
     <l n="25">There may be profit in these arts , but still</l>
     <l n="26">Learning is labour , call it what you will —</l>
     <l n="27">Upon the youthful mind a heavy load ;</l>
     <l n="28">Nor must we hope to find the royal road .</l>
     <l n="29">Some will their easy steps to science show ,</l>
     <l n="30">And some to heav'n itself their by-way know ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Ah ! trust them not ;— who fame or bliss would share ,</l>
     <l n="32">Must learn by labour , and must live by care .</l>
     <l n="33">Another matron of superior kind</l>
     <l n="34">For higher schools prepares the rising mind ;</l>
     <l n="35">Preparatory she her learning calls ,</l>
     <l n="36">The step first made to colleges and halls .</l>
     <l n="37">She early sees to what the mind will grow ,</l>
     <l n="38">Nor abler judge of infant-powers I know ;</l>
     <l n="39">She sees what soon the lively will impede ,</l>
     <l n="40">And how the steadier will in turn succeed ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Observes the dawn of wisdom , fancy , taste ,</l>
     <l n="42">And knows what parts will wear and what will waste :</l>
     <l n="43">She marks the mind too lively , and at once</l>
     <l n="44">Sees the gay coxcomb and the rattling dunce .</l>
     <l n="45">Long has she lived , and much she loves to trace</l>
     <l n="46">Her former pupils , now a lordly race ;</l>
     <l n="47">Whom when she sees rich robes and furs bedeck ,</l>
     <l n="48">She marks the pride which once she strove to check .</l>
     <l n="49">A burgess comes , and she remembers well</l>
     <l n="50">How hard her task to make his worship spell ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Cold , selfish , dull , inanimate , unkind ,</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Twas but by anger he display 'd a mind ;</l>
     <l n="53">Now civil , smiling , complaisant , and gay ,</l>
     <l n="54">The world has worn th ’ unsocial crust away ;</l>
     <l n="55">That sullen spirit now a softness wears ,</l>
     <l n="56">And , save by fits , e'en dulness disappears :</l>
     <l n="57">But still the matron can the man behold ,</l>
     <l n="58">Dull , selfish , hard , inanimate , and cold .</l>
     <l n="59">A merchant passes ;— “ probity and truth ,</l>
     <l n="60">Prudence and patience , mark 'd thee from thy youth . ” 60</l>
     <l n="61">Thus she observes , but oft retains her fears</l>
     <l n="62">For him , who now with name unstain 'd appears ;</l>
     <l n="63">Nor hope relinquishes for one who yet</l>
     <l n="64">Is lost in error and involved in debt ;</l>
     <l n="65">For latent evil in that heart she found ,</l>
     <l n="66">More open here , but here the core was sound .</l>
     <l n="67">Various our day-schools : here behold we one</l>
     <l n="68">Empty and still ;— the morning duties done ,</l>
     <l n="69">Soil 'd , tatter 'd , worn , and thrown in various heaps ,</l>
     <l n="70">Appear their books , and there confusion sleeps ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">The workmen all are from the Babel fled ,</l>
     <l n="72">And lost their tools , till the return they dread .</l>
     <l n="73">Meantime the master , with his wig awry ,</l>
     <l n="74">Prepares his books for business by-and-by .</l>
     <l n="75">Now all th ’ insignia of the monarch laid</l>
     <l n="76">Beside him rest , and none stand by afraid ;</l>
     <l n="77">He , while his troop light-hearted leap and play ,</l>
     <l n="78">Is all intent on duties of the day ;</l>
     <l n="79">No more the tyrant stern or judge severe ,</l>
     <l n="80">He feels the father 's and the husband 's fear . 80</l>
     <l n="81">Ah ! little think the timid trembling crowd ,</l>
     <l n="82">That one so wise , so powerful , and so proud ,</l>
     <l n="83">Should feel himself , and dread the humble ills</l>
     <l n="84">Of rent-day charges and of coalman 's bills ;</l>
     <l n="85">That , while they mercy from their judge implore ,</l>
     <l n="86">He fears himself — a knocking at the door ;</l>
     <l n="87">And feels the burthen as his neighbour states</l>
     <l n="88">His humble portion to the parish-rates .</l>
     <l n="89">They sit th ’ allotted hours , then eager run ,</l>
     <l n="90">Rushing to pleasure when the duty 's done ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">His hour of leisure is of different kind ,</l>
     <l n="92">Then cares domestic rush upon his mind ;</l>
     <l n="93">And half the ease and comfort he enjoys ,</l>
     <l n="94">Is when surrounded by slates , books , and boys .</l>
     <l n="95">Poor Reuben Dixon has the noisiest school</l>
     <l n="96">Of ragged lads , who ever bow 'd to rule ;</l>
     <l n="97">Low in his price — the men who heave our coals ,</l>
     <l n="98">And clean our causeways , send him boys in shoals .</l>
     <l n="99">To see poor Reuben , with his fry beside —</l>
     <l n="100">Their half-check 'd rudeness and his half-scorn 'd pride — 100</l>
     <l n="101">Their room , the sty in which th ’ assembly meet ,</l>
     <l n="102">In the close lane behind the Northgate-street ;</l>
     <l n="103">T ’ observe his vain attempts to keep the peace ,</l>
     <l n="104">Till tolls the bell , and strife and troubles cease ,</l>
     <l n="105">Calls for our praise ; his labour praise deserves ,</l>
     <l n="106">But not our pity ; Reuben has no nerves .</l>
     <l n="107">‘ Mid noise and dirt , and stench , and play , and prate ,</l>
     <l n="108">He calmly cuts the pen or views the slate .</l>
     <l n="109">But Leonard !— yes , for Leonard 's fate I grieve ,</l>
     <l n="110">Who loathes the station which he dares not leave ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">He cannot dig , he will not beg his bread ;</l>
     <l n="112">All his dependence rests upon his head ;</l>
     <l n="113">And , deeply skill 'd in sciences and arts ,</l>
     <l n="114">On vulgar lads he wastes superior parts .</l>
     <l n="115">Alas ! what grief that feeling mind sustains ,</l>
     <l n="116">In guiding hands and stirring torpid brains ;</l>
     <l n="117">He whose proud mind from pole to pole will move ,</l>
     <l n="118">And view the wonders of the worlds above ;</l>
     <l n="119">Who thinks and reasons strongly — hard his fate ,</l>
     <l n="120">Confined for ever to the pen and slate . 120</l>
     <l n="121">True , he submits , and when the long dull day</l>

     <l n="123">To other worlds with cheerful view he looks ,</l>
     <l n="124">And parts the night between repose and books .</l>
     <l n="125">Amid his labours , he has sometimes tried</l>
     <l n="126">To turn a little from his cares aside ;</l>
     <l n="127">Pope , Milton , Dryden , with delight has seized ,</l>
     <l n="128">His soul engaged and of his trouble eased .</l>
     <l n="129">When , with a heavy eye and ill-done sum ,</l>
     <l n="130">No part conceived , a stupid boy will come ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">Then Leonard first subdues the rising frown ,</l>
     <l n="132">And bids the blockhead lay his blunders down ;</l>
     <l n="133">O'er which disgusted he will turn his eye , }</l>
     <l n="134">To his sad duty his sound mind apply , }</l>
     <l n="135">And , vex 'd in spirit , throw his pleasures by . }</l>
     <l n="136">Turn we to schools which more than these afford —</l>
     <l n="137">The sound instruction and the wholesome board ;</l>
     <l n="138">And first our school for ladies :— pity calls</l>
     <l n="139">For one soft sigh , when we behold these walls ,</l>
     <l n="140">Placed near the town , and where , from window high , 140</l>
     <l n="141">The fair , confined , may our free crowds espy ,</l>
     <l n="142">With many a stranger gazing up and down ,</l>
     <l n="143">And all the envied tumult of the town ;</l>
     <l n="144">May , in the smiling summer-eve , when they</l>
     <l n="145">Are sent to sleep the pleasant hours away ,</l>
     <l n="146">Behold the poor ( whom they conceive the bless 'd )</l>
     <l n="147">Employ 'd for hours , and grieved they cannot rest .</l>
     <l n="148">Here the fond girl , whose days are sad and few</l>
     <l n="149">Since dear mamma pronounced the last adieu ,</l>
     <l n="150">Looks to the road , and fondly thinks she hears 150</l>
     <l n="151">The carriage-wheels , and struggles with her tears .</l>
     <l n="152">All yet is new , the misses great and small ,</l>
     <l n="153">Madam herself , and teachers , odious all ;</l>
     <l n="154">From laughter , pity , nay command , she turns ,</l>
     <l n="155">But melts in softness , or with anger burns ;</l>
     <l n="156">Nauseates her food , and wonders who can sleep</l>
     <l n="157">On such mean beds , where she can only weep .</l>
     <l n="158">She scorns condolence — but to all she hates</l>
     <l n="159">Slowly at length her mind accommodates ;</l>
     <l n="160">Then looks on bondage with the same concern 160</l>
     <l n="161">As others felt , and finds that she must learn</l>
     <l n="162">As others learn 'd — the common lot to share ,</l>
     <l n="163">To search for comfort and submit to care .</l>
     <l n="164">There are , ‘ tis said , who on these seats attend ,</l>
     <l n="165">And to these ductile minds destruction vend ;</l>
     <l n="166">Wretches ( to virtue , peace , and nature , foes )</l>
     <l n="167">To these soft minds , their wicked trash expose ;</l>
     <l n="168">Seize on the soul , ere passions take the sway ,</l>
     <l n="169">And lead the heart , ere yet it feels , astray :</l>
     <l n="170">Smugglers obscene !— and can there be who take 170</l>
     <l n="171">Infernal pains , the sleeping vice to wake ?</l>
     <l n="172">Can there be those , by whom the thought defiled</l>
     <l n="173">Enters the spotless bosom of a child ?</l>
     <l n="174">By whom the ill is to the heart convey 'd , }</l>
     <l n="175">Who lend the foe , not yet in arms , their aid , }</l>
     <l n="176">And sap the city-walls before the siege be laid ? }</l>
     <l n="177">Oh ! rather skulking in the by-ways steal ,</l>
     <l n="178">And rob the poorest traveller of his meal ;</l>
     <l n="179">Burst through the humblest trader 's bolted door ;</l>
     <l n="180">Bear from the widow 's hut her winter-store ; 180</l>
     <l n="181">With stolen steed on highways take your stand ,</l>
     <l n="182">Your lips with curses arm 'd , with death your hand ;—</l>
     <l n="183">Take all but life — the virtuous more would say , }</l>
     <l n="184">Take life itself , dear as it is , away , }</l>
     <l n="185">Rather than guilty thus the guileless soul betray . }</l>
     <l n="186">Years , pass away — let us suppose them past ,</l>
     <l n="187">Th ’ accomplish 'd nymph for freedom looks at last ;</l>
     <l n="188">All hardships over , which a school contains ,</l>
     <l n="189">The spirit 's bondage and the body 's pains ;</l>
     <l n="190">Where teachers make the heartless , trembling set 190</l>
     <l n="191">Of pupils suffer for their own regret ;</l>
     <l n="192">Where winter 's cold , attack 'd by one poor fire ,</l>
     <l n="193">Chills the fair child , commanded to retire ;</l>
     <l n="194">She felt it keenly in the morning air ,</l>
     <l n="195">Keenly she felt it at the evening prayer .</l>
     <l n="196">More pleasant summer ; but then walks were made</l>
     <l n="197">Not a sweet ramble , but a slow parade ;</l>
     <l n="198">They moved by pairs beside the hawthorn-hedge ,</l>
     <l n="199">Only to set their feelings on an edge ;</l>
     <l n="200">And now at eve , when all their spirits rise , 200</l>
     <l n="201">Are sent to rest , and all their pleasure dies ;</l>
     <l n="202">Where yet they all the town alert can see ,</l>
     <l n="203">And distant plough-boys pacing o'er the lea .</l>
     <l n="204">These and the tasks successive masters brought —</l>
     <l n="205">The French they conn 'd , the curious works they wrought ,</l>
     <l n="206">The hours they made their taper fingers strike ,</l>
     <l n="207">Note after note , all dull to them alike ;</l>
     <l n="208">Their drawings , dancings on appointed days ,</l>
     <l n="209">Playing with globes , and getting parts of plays ;</l>
     <l n="210">The tender friendships made ‘ twixt heart and heart , 210</l>
     <l n="211">When the dear friends had nothing to impart :—</l>
     <l n="212">All ! all ! are over ;— now th ’ accomplished maid</l>
     <l n="213">Longs for the world , of nothing there afraid .</l>
     <l n="214">Dreams of delight invade her gentle breast ,</l>
     <l n="215">And fancied lovers rob the heart of rest ;</l>
     <l n="216">At the paternal door a carriage stands ,</l>
     <l n="217">Love knits their hearts , and Hymen joins their hands .</l>
     <l n="218">Ah !— world unknown ! how charming is thy view ,</l>
     <l n="219">Thy pleasures many , and each pleasure new !</l>
     <l n="220">Ah !— world experienced ! what of thee is told ? 220</l>
     <l n="221">How few thy pleasures , and those few how old !</l>
     <l n="222">Within a silent street , and far apart</l>
     <l n="223">From noise of business , from a quay or mart ,</l>
     <l n="224">Stands an old spacious building , and the din</l>
     <l n="225">You hear without , explains the work within ;</l>
     <l n="226">Unlike the whispering of the nymphs , this noise</l>
     <l n="227">Loudly proclaims a “ boarding-school for boys . ”</l>
     <l n="228">The master heeds it not , for thirty years</l>
     <l n="229">Have render 'd all familiar to his ears ;</l>
     <l n="230">He sits in comfort , ‘ mid the various sound 230</l>
     <l n="231">Of mingled tones for ever flowing round ;</l>
     <l n="232">Day after day he to his task attends —</l>
     <l n="233">Unvaried toil , and care that never ends .</l>
     <l n="234">Boys in their works proceed ; while his employ</l>
     <l n="235">Admits no change , or changes but the boy ;</l>
     <l n="236">Yet time has made it easy ;— he beside</l>
     <l n="237">Has power supreme , and power is sweet to pride .</l>
     <l n="238">But grant him pleasure ;— what can teachers feel ,</l>
     <l n="239">Dependent helpers always at the wheel ?</l>
     <l n="240">Their power despised , their compensation small , 240</l>
     <l n="241">Their labour dull , their life laborious all ;</l>
     <l n="242">Set after set , the lower lads to make</l>
     <l n="243">Fit for the class which their superiors take ;</l>
     <l n="244">The road of learning for a time to track</l>
     <l n="245">In roughest state , and then again go back ;</l>
     <l n="246">Just the same way on other troops to wait —</l>
     <l n="247">Attendants fix 'd at learning 's lower gate .</l>
     <l n="248">The day-tasks now are over ;— to their ground</l>
     <l n="249">Rush the gay crowd with joy-compelling sound ;</l>
     <l n="250">Glad to [ elude ] the burthens of the day , 250</l>
     <l n="251">The eager parties hurry to their play .</l>
     <l n="252">Then in these hours of liberty we find</l>
     <l n="253">The native bias of the opening mind ;</l>
     <l n="254">They yet possess not skill the mask to place ,</l>
     <l n="255">And hide the passions glowing in the face ;</l>
     <l n="256">Yet some are found — the close , the sly , the mean ,</l>
     <l n="257">Who know already all must not be seen .</l>
     <l n="258">Lo ! one who walks apart , although so young ,</l>
     <l n="259">He lays restraint upon his eye and tongue ;</l>
     <l n="260">Nor will he into scrapes or dangers get , 260</l>
     <l n="261">And half the school are in the stripling 's debt .</l>
     <l n="262">Suspicious , timid , he is much afraid</l>
     <l n="263">Of trick and plot — he dreads to be betray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="264">He shuns all friendship , for he finds they lend ,</l>
     <l n="265">When lads begin to call each other friend .</l>
     <l n="266">Yet self with self has war ; the tempting sight</l>
     <l n="267">Of fruit on sale provokes his appetite ;—</l>
     <l n="268">See ! how , he walks the sweet seduction by ; }</l>
     <l n="269">That he is tempted , costs him first a sigh — }</l>
     <l n="270">‘ Tis dangerous to indulge , ‘ tis grievous to deny ! 270 }</l>
     <l n="271">This he will choose , and whispering asks the price .</l>
     <l n="272">The purchase dreadful , but the portion nice ;</l>
     <l n="273">Within the pocket he explores the pence ;</l>
     <l n="274">Without , temptation strikes on either sense ,</l>
     <l n="275">The sight , the smell ;— but then he thinks again</l>
     <l n="276">Of money gone ! while fruit nor taste remain .</l>
     <l n="277">Meantime there comes an eager thoughtless boy ,</l>
     <l n="278">Who gives the price and only feels the joy :</l>
     <l n="279">Example dire ! the youthful miser stops ,</l>
     <l n="280">And slowly back the treasured coinage drops . 280</l>
     <l n="281">Heroic deed ! for should he now comply ,</l>
     <l n="282">Can he to-morrow 's appetite deny ?</l>
     <l n="283">Beside , these spendthrifts who so friendly live ,</l>
     <l n="284">Cloy 'd with their purchase , will a portion give .—</l>
     <l n="285">Here ends debate , he buttons up his store ,</l>
     <l n="286">And feels the comfort that it burns no more ,</l>
     <l n="287">Unlike to him the tyrant-boy , whose sway</l>
     <l n="288">All hearts acknowledge ; him the crowds obey :</l>
     <l n="289">At his command they break through every rule ;</l>
     <l n="290">Whoever governs , he controls the school ; 290</l>
     <l n="291">‘ Tis not the distant emperor moves their fear ,</l>
     <l n="292">But the proud viceroy who is ever near .</l>
     <l n="293">Verres could do that mischief in a day ,</l>
     <l n="294">For which not Rome , in all its power , could pay ;</l>
     <l n="295">And these boy-tyrants will their slaves distress ,</l>
     <l n="296">And do the wrongs no master can redress .</l>
     <l n="297">The mind they load with fear ; it feels disdain }</l>
     <l n="298">For its own baseness ; yet it tries in vain }</l>
     <l n="299">To shake th ’ admitted power ;— the coward comes again . }</l>
     <l n="300">‘ Tis more than present pain these tyrants give , 300</l>
     <l n="301">Long as we 've life some strong impressions live ;</l>
     <l n="302">And these young ruffians in the soul will sow</l>
     <l n="303">Seeds of all vices that on weakness grow .</l>
     <l n="304">Hark ! at his word the trembling younglings flee ;</l>
     <l n="305">Where he is walking none must walk but he ;</l>
     <l n="306">See ! from the winter-fire the weak retreat ;</l>
     <l n="307">His the warm corner , his the favourite seat ,</l>
     <l n="308">Save when he yields it to some slave to keep</l>
     <l n="309">Awhile , then back , at his return , to creep .</l>
     <l n="310">At his command his poor dependents fly , 310</l>
     <l n="311">And humbly bribe him as a proud ally ;</l>
     <l n="312">Flatter 'd by all , the notice he bestows</l>
     <l n="313">Is gross abuse , and bantering and blows ;</l>
     <l n="314">Yet he 's a dunce , and , spite of all his fame</l>
     <l n="315">Without the desk , within he feels his shame :</l>
     <l n="316">For there the weaker boy , who felt his scorn ,</l>
     <l n="317">For him corrects the blunders of the morn ;</l>
     <l n="318">And he is taught , unpleasant truth ! to find</l>
     <l n="319">The trembling body has the prouder mind .</l>
     <l n="320">Hark to that shout , that burst of empty noise , 320</l>
     <l n="321">From a rude set of bluff , obstreperous boys ;</l>
     <l n="322">They who , like colts let loose , with vigour bound ,</l>
     <l n="323">And thoughtless spirit , o'er the beaten ground ;</l>
     <l n="324">Fearless they leap , and every youngster feels</l>
     <l n="325">His Alma active in his hands and heels .</l>
     <l n="326">These are the sons of farmers , and they come</l>
     <l n="327">With partial fondness for the joys of home ;</l>
     <l n="328">Their minds are coursing in their fathers ’ fields ,</l>
     <l n="329">And e'en the dream a lively pleasure yields ;</l>
     <l n="330">They , much enduring , sit th ’ allotted hours , 330</l>
     <l n="331">And o'er a grammar waste their sprightly powers ;</l>
     <l n="332">They dance ; but them can measured steps delight ,</l>
     <l n="333">Whom horse and hounds to daring deeds excite ?</l>
     <l n="334">Nor could they bare to wait from meal to meal ,</l>
     <l n="335">Did they not slyly to the chamber steal ,</l>
     <l n="336">And there the produce of the basket seize ,</l>
     <l n="337">The mother 's gift ! still studious of their ease .</l>
     <l n="338">Poor Alma , thus oppress 'd , forbears to rise ,</l>

     <l n="342">The farm , the ship , the humble shop have each</l>
     <l n="343">Gains which severest studies seldom reach .</l>
     <l n="344">At college place a youth , who means to raise</l>
     <l n="345">His state by merit and his name by praise ;</l>
     <l n="346">Still much he hazards ; there is serious strife</l>
     <l n="347">In the contentions of a scholar 's life .</l>
     <l n="348">Not all the mind 's attention , care , distress ,</l>
     <l n="349">Nor diligence itself , ensure success ;</l>
     <l n="350">His jealous heart a rival 's power may dread , 350</l>
     <l n="351">Till its strong feelings have confused his head ,</l>
     <l n="352">And , after days and months , nay , years of pain ,</l>

     <l n="355">For other prospects he begins to live ;</l>
     <l n="356">Begins to feel that man was form 'd to look</l>
     <l n="357">And long for other objects than a book .</l>
     <l n="358">In his mind 's eye his house and glebe he sees ,</l>
     <l n="359">And farms and talks with farmers at his ease ;</l>
     <l n="360">And time is lost , till fortune sends him forth 360</l>
     <l n="361">To a rude world unconscious of his worth ;</l>
     <l n="362">There in some petty parish to reside ,</l>
     <l n="363">The college-boast , then turn 'd the village-guide ;</l>
     <l n="364">And , though awhile his flock and dairy please ,</l>

     <l n="366">Glad when a friend shall come to break his rest ,</l>
     <l n="367">And speak of all the pleasures they possess 'd —</l>
     <l n="368">Of masters , fellows , tutors , all with whom</l>
     <l n="369">They shared those pleasures , never more to come ;</l>
     <l n="370">Till both conceive the times by bliss endear 'd , 370</l>
     <l n="371">Which once so dismal and so dull appear 'd .</l>

     <l n="375">And to his college all his care confined ;</l>

     <l n="378">Let his apartments with his taste agree ,</l>
     <l n="379">And all his views be those he loves to see ;</l>
     <l n="380">Let him each day behold the savoury treat , 380</l>
     <l n="381">For which he pays not , but is paid to eat ;</l>
     <l n="382">These joys and glories soon delight no more ,</l>
     <l n="383">Although , withheld , the mind is vex 'd and sore ;</l>
     <l n="384">The honour too is to the place confined ;</l>

     <l n="386">Strangers no wranglers in these figures see ,</l>
     <l n="387">Nor give they worship to a high degree .</l>
     <l n="388">Unlike the prophet 's is the scholar 's case ,</l>
     <l n="389">His honour all is in his dwelling-place ;</l>
     <l n="390">And there such honours are familiar things ; 390</l>

     <l n="393">By statutes govern 'd and with rules oppress 'd .</l>
     <l n="394">When all these forms and duties die away ,</l>
     <l n="395">And the day passes like the former day ,</l>
     <l n="396">Then , of exterior things at once bereft ,</l>
     <l n="397">He 's to himself and one attendant left ;</l>
     <l n="398">Nay , John too goes ; nor aught of service more</l>
     <l n="399">Remains for him ; he gladly quits the door ,</l>
     <l n="400">And , as he whistles to the college-gate , 400</l>
     <l n="401">He kindly pities his poor master 's fate .</l>
     <l n="402">Books cannot always please , however good ;</l>
     <l n="403">Minds are not ever craving for their food ;</l>

     <l n="415">For labours past and honours long delay 'd .</l>
     <l n="416">No ! ‘ tis not worldly gain , although by chance</l>
     <l n="417">The sons of learning may to wealth advance ;</l>
     <l n="418">Nor station high , though in some favouring hour</l>
     <l n="419">The sons of learning may arrive at power ;</l>
     <l n="420">Nor is it glory , though the public voice 420</l>
     <l n="421">Of honest praise will make the heart rejoice ;</l>
     <l n="422">But ‘ tis the mind 's own feelings give the joy ,</l>
     <l n="423">Pleasures she gathers in her own employ —</l>
     <l n="424">Pleasures that gain or praise cannot bestow ,</l>
     <l n="425">Yet can dilate and raise them when they flow .</l>
     <l n="426">For this the poet looks the world around ,</l>
     <l n="427">Where form and life and reasoning man are found .</l>
     <l n="428">He loves the mind in all its modes to trace ,</l>
     <l n="429">And all the manners of the changing race ;</l>
     <l n="430">Silent he walks the road of life along , 430</l>
     <l n="431">And views the aims of its tumultuous throng ;</l>
     <l n="432">He finds what shapes the Proteus-passions take ,</l>
     <l n="433">And what strange waste of life and joy they make ,</l>
     <l n="434">And loves to show them in their varied ways ,</l>
     <l n="435">With honest blame or with unflattering praise .</l>
     <l n="436">‘ Tis good to know , ‘ tis pleasant to impart ,</l>
     <l n="437">These turns and movements of the human heart ;</l>
     <l n="438">The stronger features of the soul to paint ,</l>
     <l n="439">And make distinct the latent and the faint ;</l>
     <l n="440">Man as he is , to place in all men 's view , 440</l>
     <l n="441">Yet none with rancour , none with scorn pursue ;</l>
     <l n="442">Nor be it ever of my portraits told ,—</l>
     <l n="443">“ Here the strong lines of malice we behold . ” —</l>

     <l n="444">This let me hope , that when in public view</l>
     <l n="445">I bring my pictures , men may feel them true ;</l>
     <l n="446">“ This is a likeness , ” may they all declare ,</l>
     <l n="447">“ And I have seen him , but I know not where ; ”</l>
     <l n="448">For I should mourn the mischief I had done ,</l>
     <l n="449">If as the likeness all would fix on one .</l>
     <l n="450">Man 's vice and crime I combat as I can , 450</l>
     <l n="451">But to his GOD and conscience leave the man ;</l>
     <l n="452">I search ( a [ Quixote ! ]) all the land about ,</l>
     <l n="453">To find its giants and enchanters out ,</l>
     <l n="454">( The giant-folly , the enchanter-vice ,</l>
     <l n="455">Whom doubtless I shall vanquish in a trice ;)</l>
     <l n="456">But is there man whom I would injure ?— no !</l>
     <l n="457">I am to him a fellow , not a foe —</l>
     <l n="458">A fellow-sinner , who must rather dread</l>
     <l n="459">The bolt , than hurl it at another 's head .</l>
     <l n="460">No ! let the guiltless , if there such be found , 460</l>
     <l n="461">Launch forth the spear , and deal the deadly wound ;</l>
     <l n="462">How can I so the cause of virtue aid ,</l>
     <l n="463">Who am myself attainted and afraid ?</l>
     <l n="464">Yet , as I can , I point the powers of rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="465">And , sparing criminals , attack the crime .</l>
