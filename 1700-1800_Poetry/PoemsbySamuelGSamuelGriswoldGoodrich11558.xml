     <p>Frontispiece ] And ‘ mid the awful stillness Of their grave , The forest oaks have flourished — And the breath Of years hath swept their races , Wave on wave , As ages fainted On the shores of death . The tumbling cliff perchance Hath thundered deep , Like a rough note Of music in the song Of centuries , and the whirlwind 's Crushing sweep , Hath ploughed the forest With its furrows strong .

      <l n="40">I 'll tell you a Fairy Tale that 's new :</l>
      <l n="41">How the merry Elves o'er the ocean flew</l>
      <l n="42">From the Emerald isle to this far-off shore ,</l>
      <l n="43">As they were wont in the days of yore ;</l>
      <l n="44">And played their pranks one moonlit night ,</l>
      <l n="45">Where the zephyrs alone could see the sight .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="46">Ere the Old world yet had found the New ,</l>
      <l n="47">The fairies oft in their frolics flew</l>
      <l n="48">To the fragrant isles of the Caribbee —</l>
      <l n="49">Bright bosom-gems of a golden sea .</l>
      <l n="50">Too dark was the film of the Indian 's eye ,</l>
      <l n="51">These gossamer sprites to suspect or spy ,—</l>
      <l n="52">So they danced ‘ mid the spicy groves unseen ,</l>
      <l n="53">And mad were their merry pranks , I ween ;</l>
      <l n="54">For the fairies , like other discreet little elves ,</l>
      <l n="55">Are freest and fondest when all by themselves .</l>
      <l n="56">No thought had they that in after time ,</l>
      <l n="57">The Muse would echo their deeds in rhyme ;</l>
      <l n="58">So gayly doffing light stocking and shoe ,</l>
      <l n="59">They tripped o'er the meadow all dappled in dew .</l>

      <l n="60">I could tell , if I would , some right merry tales ,</l>
      <l n="61">Of unslippered fairies that danced in the vales —</l>
      <l n="62">But the lovers of scandal I leave in the lurch —</l>
      <l n="63">And , beside , these elves do n't belong to the church .</l>
      <l n="64">If they danced — be it known — ‘ twas not in the clime</l>
      <l n="65">Of your Mathers and Hookers , where laughter was crime ;</l>
      <l n="66">Where sentinel virtue kept guard o'er the lip ,</l>
      <l n="67">Though witchcraft stole into the heart by a slip !</l>
      <l n="68">Oh no ! ‘ twas the land of the fruit and the flower —</l>
      <l n="69">Where Summer and Spring both dwelt in one bower —</l>
      <l n="70">Where one hung the citron , all ripe from the bough ,</l>
      <l n="71">And the other with blossoms encircled her brow ;</l>
      <l n="72">Where the mountains embosomed rich tissues of gold ,</l>
      <l n="73">And the rivers o'er rubies and emeralds rolled .</l>
      <l n="74">It was there , where the seasons came only to bless ,</l>
      <l n="75">And the fashions of Eden still lingered , in dress ,</l>
      <l n="76">That these gay little fairies were wont , as I say ,</l>
      <l n="77">To steal in their merriest gambols away .</l>
      <l n="78">But dropping the curtain o'er frolic and fun ,</l>
      <l n="79">Too good to be told , or too bad to be done ,</l>
      <l n="80">I give you a legend from Fancy 's own sketch ,</l>
      <l n="81">Though I warn you he 's given to fibbing — the wretch !</l>
      <l n="82">Yet I learn by the legends of breezes and brooks ,</l>
      <l n="83">‘ Tis as true as the fairy tales told in the books .</l>

      <l n="84">One night , when the moon shone fair on the main ,</l>
      <l n="85">Choice spirits were gathered from meadow and plain —</l>
      <l n="86">And lightly embarking from Erin 's bold cliffs ,</l>
      <l n="87">They slid o'er the wave in their moonbeam skiffs .</l>
      <l n="88">A ray for a rudder — a thought for a sail —</l>

      <l n="101">Of coral , where mullet</l>

      <l n="104">Of silence and sleep ,</l>
      <l n="105">They waltzed , as if mocking</l>
      <l n="106">The death of the deep :</l>
      <l n="107">How , oft , where the wreck</l>
      <l n="108">Lay scattered and torn ,</l>
      <l n="109">They peeped in the skull ,</l>
      <l n="110">All ghastly and lorn ;</l>
      <l n="111">Or deep , ‘ mid wild rocks ,</l>
      <l n="112">Quizzed the goggling shark ,</l>
      <l n="113">And mouthed at the sea-wolf ,</l>
      <l n="114">So solemn and stark ;</l>
      <l n="115">Each seeming to think</l>
      <l n="116">That the earth and the sea</l>
      <l n="117">Were made but for fairies ,</l>

     <l n="199">In days of yore , while yet the world was new ,</l>
     <l n="200">And all around was beautiful to view —</l>
     <l n="201">When spring or summer ruled the happy hours ,</l>
     <l n="202">And golden fruit hung down mid opening flowers ;</l>
     <l n="203">When , if you chanced among the woods to stray ,</l>
     <l n="204">The rosy-footed dryad led the way ,—</l>
     <l n="205">Or if , beside a mountain brook , your path ,</l>
     <l n="206">You ever caught some naïad at her bath :</l>
     <l n="207">‘ Twas in that golden day , that Damon strayed .</l>
     <l n="208">Musing , alone , along a Grecian glade .</l>
     <l n="209">Retired the scene , yet in the morning light ,</l>
     <l n="210">Athens in view , shone glimmering to the sight .</l>
     <l n="211">‘ Twas far away , yet painted on the skies ,</l>
     <l n="212">It seemed a marble cloud of glorious dyes ,</l>
     <l n="213">Where yet the rosy morn , with lingering ray ,</l>
     <l n="214">Loved on the sapphire pediments to play .</l>
     <l n="215">But why did Damon heed the distant scene ?</l>
     <l n="216">For he was young , and all around was green :</l>
     <l n="217">A noisy brook was romping through the dell ,</l>
     <l n="218">And on his ear the laughing echoes fell :</l>
     <l n="219">Along his path the stooping wild flowers grew ,</l>
     <l n="220">And woo 'd the very zephyrs as they flew .</l>
     <l n="221">Then why young Damon , heeding nought around ,</l>
     <l n="222">Seemed in some thrall of distant vision bound ,</l>
     <l n="223">I cannot tell — but dreamy grew his gaze ,</l>
     <l n="224">And all his thought was in a misty maze .</l>
     <l n="225">Awhile he sauntered — then beneath a tree ,</l>
     <l n="226">He sat him down , and there a reverie</l>
     <l n="227">Came o'er his spirit like a spell ,— and bright ,</l>
     <l n="228">A truth-like vision , shone upon his sight .</l>
     <l n="229">Around on every side , with glowing pinions ,</l>
     <l n="230">A circling band , as if from Jove 's dominions ,</l>
     <l n="231">All wooing came , and sought with wily art ,</l>
     <l n="232">To steal away the youthful dreamer 's heart .</l>
     <l n="233">One offered wealth — another spoke of fame ,</l>
     <l n="234">And held a wreath to twine around his name .</l>
     <l n="235">One brought the pallet , and the magic brush ,</l>
     <l n="236">By which creative art bids nature blush ,</l>
     <l n="237">To see her rival — and the artful boy ,</l>
     <l n="238">His story told — the all-entrancing joy</l>
     <l n="239">His skill could give ,— but well the rogue concealed</l>
     <l n="240">The piercing thorns that flourish , unrevealed ,</l>
     <l n="241">Along the artist 's path — the poverty , the strife</l>
     <l n="242">Of study , and the weary waste of life —</l>
     <l n="243">All these , the drawback of his wily tale ,</l>
     <l n="244">The little artist covered with a veil .</l>
     <l n="245">Young Damon listened , and his heart beat high —</l>
     <l n="246">But now a cunning archer gained his eye —</l>
     <l n="247">And stealing close , he whispered in his ear ,</l>
     <l n="248">A glowing tale , so musical and dear ,</l>
     <l n="249">That Damon vowed , like many a panting youth ,</l>
     <l n="250">To Love , eternal constancy and truth !</l>
     <l n="251">But while the whisper from his bosom broke ,</l>
     <l n="252">A fearful Image to his spirit spoke :</l>
     <l n="253">With frowning brow , and giant arm he stood ,</l>
     <l n="254">Holding a glass , as if in threatening mood ,</l>
     <l n="255">He waited but a moment for the sand ,</l>
     <l n="256">To sweep the idle Dreamer from the land !</l>
     <l n="257">Young Damon started , and his dream was o'er ,</l>
     <l n="258">But to his soul , the seeming vision bore</l>
     <l n="259">A solemn meaning , which he could not spurn —</l>
     <l n="260">And Youth , perchance , may from our fable learn ,</l>
     <l n="261">That while the beckoning passions woo and sigh ,</l>
     <l n="262">TIME , with his ready scythe , stands listening by .</l>

      <l n="956">Yet o'er it bids the billow roll .</l>
      <l n="957">A helmless wreck upon the tide —</l>
      <l n="958">An earthquake 's ruin wrapped in gloom —</l>
      <l n="959">A gnarled oak blasted in its pride —</l>
      <l n="960">Are feeble emblems of my doom .</l>
      <l n="961">There is a tongue in every leaf ,</l>
      <l n="962">A sigh in every tossing tree —</l>
      <l n="963">A murmur in each wave ; of grief</l>
      <l n="964">They whisper , and they speak to me .</l>
      <l n="965">Nature hath many voices — strings</l>

      <l n="972">A chorus for the skies , alone .</l>
      <l n="973">At night , when the pale moonlight falls</l>
      <l n="974">O'er prairies , sleeping like a grave ,</l>

      <l n="976">Pours in a flood its silvery wave —</l>
      <l n="977">I climb the cliff , and hear the song ,</l>
      <l n="978">That o'er the breast of stillness steals :</l>
      <l n="979">I hear the cataract thundering strong</l>
      <l n="980">From far ; I hear the wave that peals</l>
      <l n="981">Along the lone lake 's pebbly shore ;</l>
      <l n="982">I hear the sweeping gust that weaves</l>
      <l n="983">The tree tops , and the winds that pour</l>
      <l n="984">In rippling lapses through the leaves .</l>
      <l n="985">And as the diapason sweeps</l>
      <l n="986">Across the breast of night , the moan</l>
      <l n="987">Of wolves upon the spirit creeps ,</l>
      <l n="988">Lending the hymn a wilder tone .</l>
      <l n="989">The panther 's wail , the owlet 's scream ,</l>
      <l n="990">The whippoorwill 's complaining song ,</l>
      <l n="991">Blend with the cataract 's solemn theme ,</l>
      <l n="992">And the wild cadences prolong .</l>
      <l n="993">And often when the heart is chilled</l>
      <l n="994">By the deep harmony , the note</l>
      <l n="995">Of some light-hearted bird is trilled</l>
      <l n="996">Upon the breeze . How sweet its throat !</l>
      <l n="997">Yet , as a gem upon the finger</l>
      <l n="998">Of a pale corse , deepens the gloom ,</l>
      <l n="999">By its bright rays that laugh and linger</l>
      <l n="1000">In the dread bosom of the tomb ;</l>
      <l n="1001">So doth the note of that wild bird ,</l>
      <l n="1002">Sadden the anthem of the hills ,</l>
      <l n="1003">And my hushed bosom , spirit-stirred ,</l>

      <l n="1217">And stealing forth , a gentle trembling thing ,</l>
      <l n="1218">It seemed an infant fearing all around —</l>
      <l n="1219">Yet clinging to its mother 's breast — the ground .</l>
      <l n="1220">But soon it bolder grew , and with a wing</l>
      <l n="1221">It went : its carol was a joyous sound ,</l>
      <l n="1222">Making the silent woods responsive ring ,</l>
      <l n="1223">And the far forest-echoes , sighing , sing .</l>

      <l n="1224">And now I stood upon the mountain 's height —</l>
      <l n="1225">Like a wide map , the landscape lay unrolled —</l>
      <l n="1226">There could I trace that rivulet 's path of light ,</l>
      <l n="1227">From the steep mountain to the sea of gold ;</l>
      <l n="1228">Now leaping o'er the rocks like chamois bold ,—</l>
      <l n="1229">Now like a crouching hare concealed from sight ,—</l>
      <l n="1230">Now hid beneath the willow 's bowering fold ,</l>
      <l n="1231">As if they sought to stay its arrowy flight ,</l>
      <l n="1232">Then give it forth again more swift and bright .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="129">
      <l n="1233">‘ Twas changeful — beautiful ; now dark , now fair —</l>
      <l n="1234">A tale of life , from childhood to the tomb —</l>
      <l n="1235">Its birth-place near the skies , in mountain air ,</l>
      <l n="1236">Where wild flowers throw around their sweet perfume ,</l>
      <l n="1237">Like the blest thoughts that often brightly bloom ,</l>
      <l n="1238">At home , beneath a mother 's culturing care —</l>
      <l n="1239">Its form now hid in shadows , such as gloom</l>
      <l n="1240">Our downward way — its grave in ocean , where</l>
      <l n="1241">It mingles with the wave — a dweller there !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="130">
      <l n="1242">And though that stream be hidden from the view ,</l>
      <l n="1243">‘ Tis yet preserved ‘ neath ocean 's briny crest :</l>
      <l n="1244">That wide eternity of waves is true —</l>
      <l n="1245">And as the planets anchored in their rest ,</l>
      <l n="1246">The sparkling streamlet lives ; and while unblest ,</l>
      <l n="1247">The land-wave stagnant lingers — there the blue</l>
      <l n="1248">Tide holds the river stainless in its breast —</l>
      <l n="1249">An image still of life , that sparkles through</l>
      <l n="1250">The starry deep of heaven , for ever new .</l>
