    <docTitle><titlePart>Thou ! whose superior , and aspiring mind Can leave the weakness of thy sex behind ; Above its follies , and its fears can rise , Quit the low earth , and gain the distant skies : Whom strength of soul and innocence have taught To think of death , nor shudder at the thought ; Say ! whence the dread , that can alike engage Vain thoughtless youth , and deep-reflecting age ; Can shake the feeble , and appal the strong ; Say ! whence the terrors , that to death belong ? Guilt must be fearful : but the guiltless too Start from the grave , and tremble at the view . The blood-stained pirate , who in neighbouring climes , Might fear , lest justice should o'ertake his crimes , Wisely may bear the sea 's tempestuous roar , And rather wait the storm , than make the shore ; But can the mariner , who sailed in vain In search of fancy 'd treasure on the main , By hope deceiv 'd , by endless whirlwinds tost , His strength exhausted , and his viands lost , When land invites him to receive at last A full reward for every danger past : Can he then wish his labours to renew , And fly the port just opening to his view ? Not less the folly of the timorous mind , Which dreads that peace , it ever longs to find ; Which worn with age , and tost in endless strife On this rough ocean , this tempestuous life , Still covets pain , and shakes with abject fear , When sickness points to death , and shews the haven near . The love of life , it yet must be confest , Was fixed by Nature in the human breast ; And Heaven thought fit that fondness to employ . To teach us to preserve the brittle toy . But why , when knowledge has improv 'd our thought , Years undeceived us , and affliction taught ; Why do we strive to grasp with eager hand , And stop the course of life 's quick-ebbing sand ? Why vainly covet , what we can n't sustain ? Why , dead to pleasure , would we live to pain ? What is this sentence , from which all would fly ? Oh ! what this horrible decree — to die ? Tis but to quit , what hourly we despise A fretful dream , that tortures as it flies .— But hold my pen !— nor let a picture stand Thus darkly coloured by this gloomy hand : Minds deeply wounded , or with spleen opprest , Grow sick of life , and sullen sink to rest : But when the soul , possest of its desires , Glows with more warmth , and burns with brighter fires ; When friendship soothes each care , and love imparts Its mutual raptures to congenial hearts ; When joyful life thus strikes the ravish 'd eye , ‘ Tis then a task , a painful task to die . See ! where Philario , poor Philario ! lies , Philario late the happy , as the wise ! Connubial love , and friendship 's pleasing power Fill 'd his good heart , and crown 'd his every hour : But sickness bids him those lost joys deplore , And death now tells him , they are his no more . Blest in each name of Husband , Father , Friend , Must those strong ties , those dear connexions end ? Must be thus leave to all the woes of life His helpless child , his unprotected wife ? While thus to earth these lov 'd ideas bind , And tear his lab'ring — his distracted mind : How shall that mind its wretched fate defy ? How calm his trouble , and how learn to die ? In vain would Faith before his eyes display The opening realms of never-ending day ; Superior love his faithful soul detains Bound , strongly bound , in Adamantine chains . But lo ! the gates of pitying Heaven unfold : A form , that earth rejoices to behold . Descends : her energy with sweetness join 'd , Speaks the bright mission for relief design 'd : See ! to Philario moves the flood of light ; And Resignation bursts upon his sight : See ! to the Cross , bedew 'd with sacred gore , Humbly she points , and bids the world adore ; Then sweetly breathing in his soul inspires A Christian spirit , and devout desires .— Hark ! his last wish , his dying pray'r ' s begun : “ Lord , as in Heaven , on earth thy will be done ! ” Calm is his soul ; his painful struggles cease ; He bows adoring , and expires in peace . O ! Resignation ; thou unerring guide To human weakness , and to earthly pride , Friend to Distress , who canst alone controul Each rising tumult in the mad'ning soul ; ‘ Tis thine alone from dark despair to save , To soothe the woes of life , and terrors of the grave : Thro ’ this rough world assist me with thy power ! Calm every thought ! adorn my latest hour , Sustain my spirit , and confirm my mind , Serene tho ’ feeling , chearful tho ’ resign 'd ! And thou ! my friend , while thus in artless verse Thy mind I copy , and thy thoughts rehearse ; Let one memorial , tho ’ unpolish 'd , stand Rais 'd to thy friendship by this grateful hand ! By partial favour let my verse be tried , And ‘ gainst thy judgement let thy love decide ! Tho ’ I no longer must thy converse share , Hear thy kind counsel , see thy pleasing care ; Yet mem'ry still upon the past shall dwell , And still the wishes of my heart shall tell : O ! be the cup of joy to thee consign 'd , Of joy unmix 'd , without a dreg behind ! For no rough monitor thy soul requires , To check the frenzy of too rash desires ; No poignant grief , to prove its latent worth , No pain to wean it from the toys of earth ; Thy soul untroubled can alike survey This gloomy world , and Heaven 's immortal day : Then while the current of thy blood shall flow , While Heaven yet lends thee to thy friends below ; Round thee may pleasure spread a chearful scene , Mild as thy heart , and as thy soul serene ! And O ! when Time shall bid thee yield thy breath , And take thy passage thro ’ the gates of death , May that last path without a pang be trod , And one short sigh conduct thee to thy God !</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>FELPHAM .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hail Felpham ! Hail ! in youth my favorite scene !</l>
     <l n="2">First in my heart of villages marine !</l>
     <l n="3">To me thy waves confirm 'd my truest wealth ,</l>
     <l n="4">My only parent 's renovated health ,</l>
     <l n="5">Whose love maternal , and whose sweet discourse</l>
     <l n="6">Gave to my feelings all their cordial force :</l>
     <l n="7">Hence mindful , how her tender spirit blest</l>
     <l n="8">Thy salutary air , and balmy rest ;</l>
     <l n="9">Thee , as profuse of recollections sweet ,</l>
     <l n="10">Fit for a pensive veteran 's calm retreat ,</l>
     <l n="11">I chose , as provident for sure decay ,</l>
     <l n="12">A nest for age in life 's declining day !</l>
     <l n="13">Reserving Eartham for a darling son ,</l>
     <l n="14">Confiding in our threads of life unspun :</l>
     <l n="15">Blind to futurity !— O blindness , given</l>
     <l n="16">As mercy 's boon to man from pitying Heaven !</l>
     <l n="17">Man could not live , if his prophetic eyes</l>
     <l n="18">View 'd all afflictions , ere they will arise .</l>
     <l n="19">Think , gentle friend , who saw'st , in chearful hour</l>
     <l n="20">Thy poet planning a sequestered tower ,</l>
     <l n="21">And gayly rearing , in affection 's pride ,</l>
     <l n="22">His little villa by the ocean 's side ;</l>
     <l n="23">Encircled then by friendly artists , three ,</l>
     <l n="24">Full of sweet fancy , and of social glee ,</l>
     <l n="25">Think what sensations must have pierc 'd his breast</l>
     <l n="26">Had a prophetic voice this truth exprest :</l>
     <l n="27">O'er thy new fabric ere six year 's have fled</l>
     <l n="28">Lonely thou'lt mourn all these dear inmates dead .</l>
     <l n="29">The unrelenting grave absorb 'd them all ,</l>
     <l n="30">And in the shade of this domestic wall ,</l>
     <l n="31">Which , as it rose re-echoed to their voice ,</l>
     <l n="32">And heard them in gay presages rejoice</l>
     <l n="33">Of future studies , works of special note !</l>
     <l n="34">That each , to deck these precincts , would devote .</l>
     <l n="35">Here robb 'd of them , their leader , and their friend ,</l>
     <l n="36">Of their kind visions feels the mournful end ,</l>
     <l n="37">Afflicted , and alone !— Yet not alone !</l>
     <l n="38">Their hovering spirits make this scene their own .</l>
     <l n="39">O sweet prerogative of love sublime !</l>
     <l n="40">Which so can soften destiny , and time ,</l>
     <l n="41">That grief-worn hearts , by Fancy 's charm revive !</l>
     <l n="42">The lost are present ! the deceas 'd alive !</l>
     <l n="43">Yes ! ye dear buried inmates of my mind !</l>
     <l n="44">Your converse still within these walls I find ;</l>
     <l n="45">In hours of study , and in hours of rest ,</l>
     <l n="46">You still to me my purest thoughts suggest :</l>
     <l n="47">My heart 's propensities you cherish still</l>
     <l n="48">To Heaven thanksgiving ! and to earth good-will !</l>
     <l n="49">In you I still behold affection 's smile ,</l>
     <l n="50">Which can all troubles of the heart beguile ;</l>
     <l n="51">I hear your kind approvance of my zeal ,</l>
     <l n="52">When , anxious all your merits to reveal ,</l>
     <l n="53">Having consign 'd your bones to sacred earth ,</l>
     <l n="54">My mind aspir 'd to memorize your worth .</l>
     <l n="55">Grateful employment of the feeling soul !</l>
     <l n="56">That , in despite of sorrow 's dark controul</l>
     <l n="57">Keeps the pure form of deathless virtue bright</l>
     <l n="58">By just commemoration 's soothing light !</l>
     <l n="59">For such employment thou wast aptly made ,</l>
     <l n="60">Thou dear sequester 'd cell ! in whose calm shade</l>
     <l n="61">Thy lonely bard might suit his plaintive strain ,</l>
     <l n="62">To solemn music from the murmuring main !</l>
     <l n="63">Belov 'd marine retreat ! I oft recall</l>
     <l n="64">The night , I first repos 'd within thy wall :</l>
     <l n="65">A night devoted , at a friend 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="66">To touch the chords of a sepulchral lyre !</l>
     <l n="67">Touch 'd not in vain !— The faithful tribute brought</l>
     <l n="68">To cureless grief the lenitive , she sought ;</l>
     <l n="69">And Lushington , thro ’ tearful anguish , smil 'd</l>
     <l n="70">On truth 's memorial of her darling child .</l>
     <l n="71">Little I thought , when eager to bestow</l>
     <l n="72">The heart 's pure offering on parental woe ,</l>
     <l n="73">How soon my filial pride , and friend most dear ,</l>
     <l n="74">Would claim the “ meed of a melodious tear . ”</l>
     <l n="75">Dear sacred shades of Cowper ! and my Son !</l>
     <l n="76">Who , in my fond affection , liv 'd as one !</l>
     <l n="77">Congenial inmates ! on whose loss I found</l>
     <l n="78">The sweetest light of life in darkness drown 'd !</l>
     <l n="79">Oft have ye witness 'd , while , in this calm cell ,</l>
     <l n="80">Ye watch 'd the lonely bard , ye lov 'd so well ,</l>
     <l n="81">Oft have ye witness 'd , how his struggling mind</l>
     <l n="82">Labour 'd affliction 's fetters to unbind ,</l>
     <l n="83">Ere his o'erhYpppHeNburthen ' d faculties could cope</l>
     <l n="84">With that ambitious task of tender hope ,</l>
     <l n="85">To render justice to you both ; and frame }</l>
     <l n="86">Memorials worthy of each honour 'd name : }</l>
     <l n="87">A debt the heart must feel ! &amp; truth , and nature claim ! }</l>
     <l n="88">Your smile , dear visionary guests of night !</l>
     <l n="89">O'er my nocturnal hours breath 'd new delight ;</l>
     <l n="90">Made me exult in labour , plann 'd for you !</l>
     <l n="91">Its progress from your inspiration grew :</l>
     <l n="92">The toil was sweet , that your approvance cheer 'd ;</l>
     <l n="93">For what your love inspir 'd , that love endear 'd .</l>
     <l n="94">Nor unregarded by the fair , and great ,</l>
     <l n="95">Was your recluse in this sequester 'd state ;</l>
     <l n="96">When I began , by just records , to prove</l>
     <l n="97">How Cowper merited our country 's love ;</l>
     <l n="98">The loveliest regent of poetic taste ;</l>
     <l n="99">First of the fair ; with all attractions grac 'd !</l>
     <l n="100">Friend of the muses ! and herself a muse !</l>
     <l n="101">Her bright eyes dimm 'd with sorrow 's sacred dews ,</l>
     <l n="102">The high-born beauty , in whose lot combin 'd</l>
     <l n="103">All — that could charm and grieve a feeling mind ,</l>
     <l n="104">Shar 'd with me , in my cell , some pensive hours ;</l>
     <l n="105">Herself most eloquent on Cowper 's powers ,</l>
     <l n="106">Urg 'd to his willing Eulogist his claim</l>
     <l n="107">To public gratitude , and purest fame .</l>
     <l n="108">The memoir , as by gradual toil it grows ,</l>
     <l n="109">Endears the tranquil scene , in which it rose ;</l>
     <l n="110">And sheds , since public favor blest the page ,</l>
     <l n="111">A soothing lustre on my letter 'd age .</l>
     <l n="112">The dues of faithful memory fondly paid</l>
     <l n="113">To him , devotion 's bard ! dear sacred shade !</l>
     <l n="114">Then my paternal hand was prompt to raise</l>
     <l n="115">To that blest pupil , who had shar 'd his praise</l>
     <l n="116">A similar record of tender truth ;</l>
     <l n="117">The genuine portraiture of studious youth —</l>
     <l n="118">Task of such pleasing pain , as pierc 'd the heart</l>
     <l n="119">Of Daedalus , the sire of antient art !</l>
     <l n="120">When , in fond zeal , his busy hand begun</l>
     <l n="121">To mould the story of his hapless son ,</l>
     <l n="122">But falter 'd , while , o'erwhelm ' d in mournful thought ,</l>
     <l n="123">He work 'd , and wept upon the work , he wrought .</l>
     <l n="124">Ah peerless youth ! whose highly-gifted hand</l>
     <l n="125">Could all varieties of skill command ,</l>
     <l n="126">Ere illness undermin 'd thy powers to use</l>
     <l n="127">The Sculptor 's chizzel , and the Painter 's hues !</l>
     <l n="128">Had thy ascending talents , unenchain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="129">Of studious life the promis 'd zenith gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="130">Confederate arts would then have joy 'd to see</l>
     <l n="131">Their English Michael Angelo in thee .</l>
     <l n="132">But never be it by true love forgot ,</l>
     <l n="133">Thou hast a higher , and a happier lot !</l>
     <l n="134">The prime of blessings , in a world like this ,</l>
     <l n="135">Is early transit to the realms of bliss :</l>
     <l n="136">Thence thy pure spirit oft will charm to rest</l>
     <l n="137">Those pangs of fond regret , that pierce my breast ,</l>
     <l n="138">When recollection mournfully surveys</l>
     <l n="139">Unfinish 'd products of thy studious days .</l>
     <l n="140">Ah what a host of filial fair designs :</l>
     <l n="141">Where , springing from the heart , the fancy shines ,</l>
     <l n="142">Thy enterprising mind had here bestow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="143">To honour Felpham as thy sire 's abode !</l>
     <l n="144">All to thy mental eyes were present here ;</l>
     <l n="145">The scene , we join 'd to deck , all yet endear ,</l>
     <l n="146">Tho ’ hardly embrios of plastic grace ,</l>
     <l n="147">Many yet want their features , and their place .</l>
     <l n="148">These vacant circlets , that still court mine eye ,</l>
     <l n="149">Can I survey , without a bursting sigh ,</l>
     <l n="150">When fond remembrance tells me that from these</l>
     <l n="151">Thy filial hand , tho ’ robb 'd of strength and ease ,</l>
     <l n="152">Yet inly conscious of ingenious power ,</l>
     <l n="153">Resolv 'd , in labour 's first reviving hour ,</l>
     <l n="154">To fashion portraits claiming just regard ,</l>
     <l n="155">The Tuscan sculptor ! and the Grecian bard !</l>
     <l n="156">Whom ‘ twas thy hope in marble to create</l>
     <l n="157">As honour 'd guardians of thy poet 's gate ;</l>
     <l n="158">There is no spot within this Villa 's bound ,</l>
     <l n="159">E'en to the Turret 's topmost airy round ,</l>
     <l n="160">Which thy kind fancy , that no ills could check .</l>
     <l n="161">With sweet ideal projects fail 'd to deck :</l>
     <l n="162">Eager to fix around , below , above ,</l>
     <l n="163">Proofs of thy skill , and monuments of love !</l>
     <l n="164">Thy gay activity how passing sweet ,</l>
     <l n="165">Ere this arising structure was complete !</l>
     <l n="166">When ‘ twas our joy its scaffolds to ascend ,</l>
     <l n="167">And mark how bright its varied views extend ;</l>
     <l n="168">To search how far the glass-assisted eye</l>
     <l n="169">May scenes of splendor , and of peace , descry !</l>
     <l n="170">The first , where , blazing in the gorgeous west ,</l>
     <l n="171">The sun delights on Vecta 's hills to rest ,</l>
     <l n="172">And gild those fleets , that , when they cease to roam ;</l>
     <l n="173">Come fraught with glory to her favorite home ;</l>
     <l n="174">The second , where , in softer northern light ,</l>
     <l n="175">Eartham , lov 'd little hill , allures the sight ,</l>
     <l n="176">And towering woods , that crown the loftier Nore ,</l>
     <l n="177">Salute our seamen , as they near the shore !</l>
     <l n="178">Ye scenes , that live in memory 's regard .</l>
     <l n="179">Whose quiet beauty charm 'd your pensive bard !</l>
     <l n="180">In hopes his eye might long delight to trace ,</l>
     <l n="181">Tho ’ distant , visible , your rural grace ;</l>
     <l n="182">In hopes of tender love , not idle pride !</l>
     <l n="183">He rear 'd his turret by the ocean 's side ,</l>
     <l n="184">Lofty , tho ’ little ! that his sight might still</l>
     <l n="185">Enjoy sweet intercourse with Eartham-hill ;</l>
     <l n="186">Where , while his heart with pure ambition glow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="187">The filial artist plann 'd his own abode ;</l>
     <l n="188">And by a telegraph , his skill design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="189">Endearing mark of his inventive mind ,</l>
     <l n="190">He meant to hold , as mutual wants require ,</l>
     <l n="191">Constant communion with his absent sire :</l>
     <l n="192">Fair purpose ! furnishing much kind employ ,</l>
     <l n="193">And oft a subject of ideal joy</l>
     <l n="194">To hearts , forbid by mercy to foresee ,</l>
     <l n="195">How soon the heaven-taught youth , by heaven 's decree</l>
     <l n="196">Must leave the favorite hill , that charm 'd his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="197">In early transit to serener skies !</l>
     <l n="198">Angel ! yet visible to mental sight !</l>
     <l n="199">Still let me , pensive in my Turret 's height ,</l>
     <l n="200">Whose view of heaven unbroken , unconfin 'd</l>
     <l n="201">Fixes the lifted eye and fills the mind ;</l>
     <l n="202">Let love , ascending from earth 's dark abyss ,</l>
     <l n="203">Still commune with thee in thy scene of bliss !</l>
     <l n="204">Sole meditation on thy heavenly worth .</l>

     <l n="2">Friend of my vernal and autumnal day ,</l>
     <l n="3">In life 's gay bloom , and in its slow decay :</l>
     <l n="4">Sargent ! who leav'st thy hermit 's studious cell ,</l>
     <l n="5">To act thy busier part , and act it well ,</l>
     <l n="6">In courts of rural justice to preside ,</l>
     <l n="7">In temperate dignity unstain 'd with pride .</l>
     <l n="8">Oft let us meet , that friendship 's honour 'd chain ,</l>
     <l n="9">In its extension may new lustre gain ;</l>
     <l n="10">So let us , cheer 'd by memory 's social blaze ,</l>
     <l n="11">Live o'er again our long-departed days .</l>
     <l n="12">I thank kind Heaven , that made the pleasure mine</l>
     <l n="13">Beneath my roof to see thy virtues shine ;</l>
     <l n="14">When Providence thy fondest wishes crown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="15">Casting thy lot on fair , and southern ground :</l>
     <l n="16">When the gay songs of Eartham 's friendly grove</l>
     <l n="17">Proclaim 'd the triumph of thy prosperous love —</l>
     <l n="18">Tis sweet to plant a friend in genial land ,</l>
     <l n="19">And see his branches round the world expand !</l>
     <l n="20">I share thy joy , the heart 's parental feast</l>
     <l n="21">To learn thy filial pilgrim in the East ,</l>
     <l n="22">Thy youthful Harry , is among the prime ,</l>
     <l n="23">Whom learning honours in her Indian clime :</l>
     <l n="24">Nor less the joy to hear thy eldest-born ,</l>
     <l n="25">Whom gifts of sacred eloquence adorn ,</l>
     <l n="26">Has , with Cicestria 's liberal applause ,</l>
     <l n="27">Those gifts exerted in the noblest cause :</l>
     <l n="28">Pleas 'd to promote the most sublime emprise</l>
     <l n="29">That Christian charity could e'er devise ;</l>
     <l n="30">To blend her votaries of every name</l>
     <l n="31">In one harmonious universal aim ;</l>
     <l n="32">To make the word of God , that truest wealth ,</l>
     <l n="33">The heart 's nutrition , and the spirit 's health</l>
     <l n="34">As common as the food , by heavenly power</l>
     <l n="35">Pour 'd from the skies , a life-preserving shower ,</l>
     <l n="36">On deserts pour 'd , in hopeless hunger 's track ,</l>
     <l n="37">When He , who gather 'd little , felt no lack .</l>
     <l n="38">My friend of many years ! we both have found</l>
     <l n="39">Darkness and sunshine on the chequer 'd ground ,</l>
     <l n="40">In different paths appointed to our feet :</l>
     <l n="41">You in the world — your host in his retreat !</l>
     <l n="42">Yet blest be Heaven , that grants us to behold</l>
     <l n="43">Wonders of Providence like those of old ,</l>
     <l n="44">When mortals in the waste , they murmuring trod ,</l>
     <l n="45">Saw , and rever 'd the guidance of their God ,</l>
     <l n="46">We have beheld , and with one heart and voice</l>
     <l n="47">Hail 'd the bright scene , that bids the globe rejoice ;</l>
     <l n="48">Nature releas 'd from devastation 's flood ,</l>
     <l n="49">And peace emerging from a sea of blood .</l>
     <l n="50">Wonders yet happier to devotion 's eyes</l>
     <l n="51">In blissful vision will now widely rise ,</l>
     <l n="52">From pure diffusive zeal in Britain sprung ,</l>
     <l n="53">Bidding the Gospel speak in every tongue ;</l>
     <l n="54">Till its effect earth 's utmost bounds attest ,</l>
     <l n="55">Jesus enthron 'd in every human breast ,</l>
     <l n="56">And all his subjects , as his mercy will 'd ,</l>
     <l n="57">Feeling within themselves his joy fulfill 'd .</l>
     <l n="58">Yes , my time-honoured friend , with one accord</l>
     <l n="59">We bless the promised advent of our Lord ,</l>
     <l n="60">In heavenly prospect , tho ’ we still sustain</l>
     <l n="61">Our unexhausted share of earthly pain .</l>
     <l n="62">But whatsoever ills yet undisplay 'd</l>
     <l n="63">May o'er our eve of life throw deeper shade ,</l>
     <l n="64">We have the constant comfort to possess</l>
     <l n="65">An antidote against the mind 's distress ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="66">That settled trust in Providence divine .</l>
     <l n="67">Which lets the Christian at no lot repine :</l>
     <l n="68">But , when most tried , his faith 's prime power employ ,</l>
     <l n="69">And make affliction minister to joy .</l>
     <l n="70">We both have past thro ’ many a troubled day ,</l>
     <l n="71">And felt adversity 's heart-searching sway :</l>
     <l n="72">But when most wounded , both have kiss 'd the rod ,</l>
     <l n="73">And blest the pangs assign 'd us by our God ;</l>
     <l n="74">To wean us from a world , which , Nature sees ,</l>
     <l n="75">None estimate aright , or quit with ease ,</l>
     <l n="76">But souls Heaven-taught , that , free from doubt 's alarm ,</l>
     <l n="77">Hail death their herald to the Saviour 's arms .</l>
     <l n="78">We both , my friend , in mind sedate and firm</l>
     <l n="79">Enter 'd with thankfulness life 's latest term .</l>
     <l n="80">And I might claim ( could years such right assume )</l>
     <l n="81">First to attain the quiet of the tomb ;</l>
     <l n="82">There show me still the friendship of our youth ,</l>
     <l n="83">And still speak of me with indulgent truth .</l>
     <l n="84">May'st thou , less worn by griefs of many a year ,</l>
     <l n="85">Still rich in filial gems , that earth endear !</l>
     <l n="86">Thy public duties long with grace discharge ,</l>
     <l n="87">Esteem 'd and honour 'd by the world at large .</l>
     <l n="88">Thy elder , idler friend that world may spare ,</l>
     <l n="89">And yet allow his name a station there ;</l>
     <l n="90">For he long literary zeal has shown ,</l>
     <l n="91">To honour merit , that surpassed his own :</l>
     <l n="92">And hop 'd to live beyond his mortal days ,</l>
     <l n="93">In England 's memory , and friendship 's praise .</l>

     <l n="75">( Or hasty muse , or irritable bard ,)</l>

     <l n="77">From wounded vanity 's vindictive rage !</l>
     <l n="78">To genuine friendship pure delight is given ,</l>
     <l n="79">Next to the favor of approving heaven ;</l>
     <l n="80">And that delight is most sublimely felt .</l>

     <l n="87">In Porteus , still thy friend ! in Cowper , mine !</l>
     <l n="88">When tender fancy , on affection 's plume ,</l>
     <l n="89">Emerging from the shadows of the tomb</l>
     <l n="90">Aspires to trace , in visionary flight ,</l>
     <l n="91">The just made perfect , thro ’ the realms of light !</l>
     <l n="92">How glows the soul , with more than earthly joy ,</l>
     <l n="93">In fondly imaging their blest employ !</l>
     <l n="94">How oft , dear Cowper ! at the close of day ,</l>
     <l n="95">When contemplation sheds her mental ray ,</l>
     <l n="96">I seem , through optics of the mind to see</l>
     <l n="97">Thy sainted spirit , from incumbrance free !</l>
     <l n="98">Marking how quick , in various hearts , arise</l>
     <l n="99">Those seeds of virtue , that thy verse supplies !</l>
     <l n="100">What joy , not speakable by mortal tongue ,</l>
     <l n="101">What praises , to the harp of seraph sung ,</l>
     <l n="102">May glad thee , now repaid for all thy woes ,</l>
     <l n="103">While boundless vision to thy spirit shows</l>
     <l n="104">How e'en thy earthly song , by heaven inspired .</l>
     <l n="105">Attain 'd the glorious aim , thy heart desired :</l>
     <l n="106">Destin 'd to spread , uncrampt by time or space ,</l>
     <l n="107">Progressive goodness thro ’ the human race !</l>
     <l n="108">Thou monitor ! by youth and age revered !</l>
     <l n="109">By wisdom prized ! to tenderness endear 'd !</l>
     <l n="110">While men and angels bid thy fame extend ,</l>
     <l n="111">And nature owns thee her benignant friend ;</l>
     <l n="112">Could there be mortals so perversely blind ,</l>
     <l n="113">As coarsely to revile thy tender mind ,</l>
     <l n="114">Basely applying , with malignant glee ,</l>
     <l n="115">The hateful title Misanthrope , to thee !</l>
     <l n="116">Let just oblivion wrap in endless night</l>
     <l n="117">Such baleful fruits of worth-defaming spight :</l>
     <l n="118">Truth ne'er could Cowper 's want of zeal reprove ,</l>
     <l n="119">As fervent as a saint in friendly love .</l>

     <l n="6">I love the candid fervency of soul ,</l>
     <l n="7">That scorns a dogmatist 's austere controul ;</l>

     <l n="20">Tis reas'ning pride , not reason , just , and sore .</l>
     <l n="21">Which in religion finds no point obscure ;</l>
     <l n="22">Which , measuring Godhead with an earthly line ,</l>
     <l n="23">Would rob the Saviour of his rights divine .</l>
     <l n="24">There are , who call Him , by their dreams beguil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="25">Mere man ; of mortal geniture the child !</l>

     <l n="48">More humbly grateful , learn ye to rejoice</l>

     <l n="57">Without Thee on a sea of darkness tost !</l>
     <l n="58">Sovereign of grace , and kindness so sublime ,</l>
     <l n="59">Thou view'st with pity their ungrateful crime ,</l>
     <l n="60">Who , while they load Thee with degrading praise ,</l>

     <l n="73">And change their darkness to eternal day !</l>
     <l n="74">How passing sweet to pure devotion 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="75">Are proofs of thy unlimited controul !</l>
     <l n="76">While the true Christian 's mental eyes survey</l>
     <l n="77">Thy heavenly origin , and healing sway .</l>
     <l n="78">Only begotten Son of Sire supreme ,</l>
     <l n="79">Whose quickening bounty was thy vital beam ,</l>
     <l n="80">Ere nature lived , when , with thy filial aid ,</l>
     <l n="81">The vast foundation of all worlds was laid !</l>
     <l n="82">When the paternal God was pleas 'd to see</l>
     <l n="83">A blight reflection of Himself in Thee !</l>
     <l n="84">The splendour of his glory ! form 'd to share</l>
     <l n="85">His purest power , his providential care ,</l>
     <l n="86">And , in consummating his gracious will ,</l>
     <l n="87">At length annihilate all cureless ill !</l>
     <l n="88">To faith 's pure eyes how ravishingly clear</l>
     <l n="89">Signs of her Lord 's Divinity appear !</l>
     <l n="90">While earth and Heaven invite her to behold</l>
     <l n="91">How the fair series of those signs unfold !</l>
     <l n="92">A blest Redeemer , and without a trace</l>
     <l n="93">Of man 's corruption in his ruin 'd race ,</l>
     <l n="94">Announc 'd by mercy to our fallen sire ,</l>
     <l n="95">Soon made that contrite criminal respire :</l>
     <l n="96">Age after age , of prophecy the breath .</l>
     <l n="97">Softening the horrors in the doom of death ,</l>
     <l n="98">While nature strove with sin 's dark woes to cope ,</l>
     <l n="99">Shed thro ’ her lighten 'd heart religious hope .</l>
     <l n="100">Thro ’ patriarchal times , in vision clear ,</l>
     <l n="101">Types of the great Deliverer appear :</l>
     <l n="102">At length , when centuries have roll 'd away .</l>
     <l n="103">And faith stands watching for her promis 'd day ,</l>
     <l n="104">She sees her Saviour from a virgin sprung ,</l>
     <l n="105">His advent by attending angels song !</l>
     <l n="106">And wisdom usher 'd by the guiding Star ,</l>
     <l n="107">Hails Him , with gifts of homage , from afar .</l>

     <l n="110">His uninstructed youth divinely sage ,</l>

     <l n="115">He dies , the ransom of redeem 'd mankind !</l>
     <l n="116">Lord of Existence ! He expires to prove</l>
     <l n="117">His matchless effort of celestial love ;</l>

     <l n="119">His glorious conquest o'er the gates of death !</l>
     <l n="120">A massive tomb receives his sacred corse ;</l>
     <l n="121">And foes would guard it with a watchful force :</l>
     <l n="122">Vain boast of folly 's disbelieving rout !</l>
     <l n="123">Who thus confirm the Deity , they doubt !</l>
     <l n="124">The grave beholds the heavenly victor rise ,</l>
     <l n="125">And soar triumphant to his native skies .</l>
     <l n="126">His troubled servants still to calm and cheer</l>
     <l n="127">See Him , in human tenderness appear !</l>
     <l n="128">And while the slow of faith He mildly blames ,</l>
     <l n="129">“ My Lord ! my God ! ” his doubt-freed saint exclaims .</l>
     <l n="130">Were He not God , and worthy of our trust ,</l>
     <l n="131">Could He admit such worship from the just ?</l>
     <l n="132">And bless the conscious of his heavenly right ,</l>
     <l n="133">Whose faith demands no evidence of sight ?</l>
     <l n="134">Yet grace divine full evidence has given ;</l>
     <l n="135">Witness ! Thou earth ! by his dread sufferings riven !</l>
     <l n="136">Witness ! Thou speaking firmament above !</l>
