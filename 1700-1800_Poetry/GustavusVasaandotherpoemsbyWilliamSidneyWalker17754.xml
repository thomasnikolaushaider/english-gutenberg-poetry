    <docImprint>J. G . BARNARD , SKINNER-STREET ,<settlement>LONDON</settlement>. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE BARONESS HOWE . It would be a sufficient reason for sanctioning this work with your Ladyship 's name , that it is an offering of gratitude , presented because there is nothing worthier to give . But there is another cause . He who celebrates a patriot , cannot address himself to any one more properly than to the daughter of a patriot ; of one who was for years the naval sun of<country>England</country>, and from whom the young and enterprising caught the unextinguishable rays of patriotism and courage . For actions and glory such as his , the female mind is not formed ; but in the calm and active virtues of private life , which are almost equally honourable to the possessor , your Ladyship maintains the dignity of your race . I call to witness those whom you have soothed in affliction , and those whom you have honoured with your friendship . They will vindicate me from the charge of flattery , and support my assertion , that your patronage is as glorious to me , as any I could possibly have chosen . With the hope , that the virtues of your excellent daughter , and your son , whom I am proud to call my friend , may answer your fullest expectations , I remain , Your Ladyship 's Most obliged And devoted Servant , W. S . WALKER .</docImprint>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">As the author of these Poems is only seventeen , some apology may be required for offering them to the public .</p>
    <p n="2">Many precedents may be quoted in favour of early publication ; and the practice perhaps is not in itself blameable , except when the advice of good judges is unasked , or the work itself uncorrected and negligent . To neither of these charges is the author liable . These poems , as well as the design of publishing them , have been approved of by many sincere and judicious friends ; and the work has been altered in many parts , in conformity to the advice of the same persons . The author has made no improper sacrifice to the Muse : he has deserted no duty , and neglected no necessary employment . Influenced by these motives , he appears before the bar of criticism , not indeed without diffidence , but unconscious of having deserved censure . If his verses are bad , he is content to sink into oblivion ; and if the public confirms the favourable judgment of his friends , he does not deny that it will give him real satisfaction .— He is sensible , that if he delayed till time had matured his judgment , and reflection perfected his ideas , the “ scribendi cacoëthes , ” perhaps an unfortunate inclination , would take a firm and unalterable possession of his mind . He is therefore determined to try the public opinion ; that he may be enabled either to pursue his poetical studies under their encouragement , or to desist in time from an useless employment . This volume is not intended to challenge approbation , but to be the precursor of something which may challenge it in future : it is not an attempt to gain the prize , but a specimen of his powers , which may entitle him to the honour of standing candidate for that prize . The reader will here find the genuine effusions of a youthful fancy , free , yet not uncontrolled ; a collection of pieces , exempt from negligence and inaccuracy , though not from the usual and inevitable faults of early compositions . To offer less than this would be arrogant , and to require more than this would be unreasonable .</p>
    <p n="3">“ Gustavus Vasa ” was originally planned ( the reader will smile ) at eleven years of age . When the author began to know what poetry was , his first design was to write an epic poem — no matter of what sort or character , so it was an epic poem . The subject was soon chosen ; and the progress of the work was various : sometimes hurried on with all the ardour of hope and enterprize , sometimes relinquished for more lively pursuits , and left to sleep for months in the leaves of a portfolio . In this manner were six long cantos completed . At length the author , in his thirteenth year , perceived numerous faults and extravagances in his early composition . He destroyed the manuscript : and some time after recommenced his poem on a new and more rational plan . Accordingly , the first and part of the second book , were written in 1810 , and the rest of the work which is published in this volume , principally in 1812 . All that is yet completed of this production ( except the sequel of the fourth book , and the whole fifth , which are yet uncorrected ) is here presented to the public ; and on its success the continuation of “ Gustavus Vasa ” depends .</p>
    <p n="4">It was designed to embrace the whole actions of the hero , from his first signalizing himself under Steen Sture , to his death in 1560 ; but as all this could not be regularly related without destroying the unity of the poem , it was thought most convenient to begin with his introduction among the Dalecarlians at Mora , and conclude with his first election to the royalty , in 1523 ; the rest being introduced by means of narration , anticipation , and episode .</p>
    <p n="5">It will be doubtless objected , that the enterprize is beyond his powers , and that he acted rashly in undertaking it . But this is no light scheme ; no work , begun for want of other amusement , and deserted when a more specious or pleasing subject for poetry presented itself . He has considered it seriously ; the subject appears full of poetical capabilities , and superior to many others which offered themselves ; and if the opinion of the world coincides with his own in this point , he has resolved to make it the favourite employment of his maturer years , and to reduce it as far as possible to perfection . Part of his plan for continuing the poem , will be found in the Notes .</p>
    <p n="6">The smaller pieces are selected from a large number of original compositions ; they are not chosen as his favourites , but as what he esteems most faultless . This appeared the safer method ; since it is impossible that “ the flimsy productions of a youth of seventeen , ” as Kirke White expresses it , should be free from considerable errors ; and we are apt to think our most irregular flights , our most vigorous ones . On these pieces , however , he places little stress ; his principal reliance is on “ Gustavus Vasa . ” The Latin Poems have been honoured by the approbation of different Masters at Eton .</p>
    <p n="7">The Author may be accused of arrogance in saying too much of himself . But he felt strongly that early publication , and the design of writing a long epic poem , would naturally be censured by many well-meaning persons ; he thought it his duty to state his motives ; and was less solicitous to avoid the possible charge of self-conceit , than the certain one of folly and presumption .</p>
    <p n="8">Any resemblance to former writers , which may occur in the course of the work , are generally unintentional . Thus the lines —</p>
    <p n="9">“ Touch 'd the abyss , and , lest his eyes might view The abandon 'd shore , into its depths withdrew , ”</p>
    <p n="10">were written before the author had seen Persius 's description of a totally abandoned man :</p>
    <p n="11">— nescit quid perdat , et , alto Demersus , summâ rursus non bullit in undâ .</p>

   <p>The Author has to express his sincere gratitude for a numerous and respectable list of Subscribers . It is far beyond his expectations ; and it encourages his hope , that the reception of the present volume will authorize his continuing in the same pursuit .</p>

     <l n="31">To share the deep recesses of his mind :</l>
     <l n="32">In these the prince unshaken trust reposed ,</l>
     <l n="33">To these his intricate designs disclosed ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="40">First of their order , as in rank and fame</l>
     <l n="41">Superior , Upsal 's haughty prelate came ;</l>
     <l n="42">Erect in priestly pride , he stalk 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="43">And tower 'd supreme o'er all the princely throng .</l>
     <l n="44">A soul congenial , and a mind replete</l>
     <l n="45">With ready artifice and bold deceit ,</l>
     <l n="46">To suit a tyrant 's ends , however base ,</l>
     <l n="47">In Christiern 's friendship had secured his place .</l>
     <l n="48">His were the senator 's and courtier 's parts ,</l>
     <l n="49">And all the statesman 's magazine of arts ;</l>
     <l n="50">His , each expedient , each all-powerful wile ,</l>
     <l n="51">To thwart a foe , or win a monarch 's smile :</l>
     <l n="52">The nicely-plann 'd and well-pursued intrigue ;</l>
     <l n="53">The smooth evasion of the hollow league ;</l>
     <l n="54">The specious argument , that subtly strays</l>
     <l n="55">Thro ’ winding sophistry 's protracted maze :</l>
     <l n="56">The complicated , deep , immense design ,</l>
     <l n="57">That works in darkness like a labouring mine ,</l>
     <l n="58">Unknown to all , ‘ till , bursting into birth ,</l>
     <l n="59">Its wide explosion shakes th ’ astonish 'd earth .</l>
     <l n="60">His was the prompt invention , fruitful still</l>
     <l n="61">In means subservient to the varying will :</l>
     <l n="62">The flexible expertness , smooth and mean ,</l>
     <l n="63">That glides thro ’ obstacles , and wins unseen :</l>
     <l n="64">The quick discernment , that with eagle eyes</l>
     <l n="65">Sees distant storms in ether darkly rise ,</l>
     <l n="66">And active vigour , that arrests their course ,</l>
     <l n="67">Or to a different aim diverts their force .</l>
     <l n="68">He , in a happier land , by freedom bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="69">Had hallow 'd virtue dawn 'd upon his breast ,</l>
     <l n="70">Had done some glorious deed , to stamp his name</l>
     <l n="71">High on the roll of ever-during fame ;</l>
     <l n="72">Snatch 'd from Oppression 's jaws some victim realm ,</l>
     <l n="73">Or fix 'd in stable peace his country 's wavering helm .</l>
     <l n="74">But baleful Guilt usurp 'd with fatal care</l>
     <l n="75">A heart which Virtue had been proud to share ;</l>
     <l n="76">And turn 'd to hateful dross the radiant ore ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose lustre might have gilded Sweden 's shore .</l>
     <l n="78">As the red dog star , Autumn 's fiery eye ,</l>
     <l n="79">Shines eminent o'er all the spangled sky ,</l>
     <l n="80">While thro ’ th ’ afflicted earth his torrid breath</l>
     <l n="81">Darts glowing fevers and a cloud of death :</l>
     <l n="82">So Trollio shone , in whose corrupted mind</l>
     <l n="83">Transcendent genius and deep guilt combined ;</l>
     <l n="84">Placed all his arduous aims within his reach ,</l>
     <l n="85">Yet fix 'd the stamp of infamy on each .</l>
     <l n="86">But Providence , whose undiscover 'd plan</l>
     <l n="87">Lies deeper than the wiliest schemes of man ,</l>
     <l n="88">Can bare the sty designer 's latent guilt ,</l>
     <l n="89">And crush to dust the structures he has built ;</l>
     <l n="90">Can disappoint the subtle tyrant 's spite ,</l>
     <l n="91">And stem the billows of his stormy might ;</l>
     <l n="92">Confound a Trollio 's skill , a Christiern 's power ,</l>
     <l n="93">And blast presumption in its haughtiest hour .</l>
     <l n="94">So Christiern found — and Trollio found it true ,</l>
     <l n="95">( Unwelcome truth , to his experience new ! )</l>
     <l n="96">That he , who trusts in guilty friendship , binds</l>
     <l n="97">His fortune to a cloud , that shifts with veering winds .</l>
     <l n="98">Throned in Religion 's seat , he scorn 'd her laws ,</l>
     <l n="99">And with a cool indifference view 'd her cause :</l>
     <l n="100">Yet , might her earthly treasures feed the fire</l>
     <l n="101">Of wild ambition , or base gain 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="102">He could assume , at will , her fairest dress —</l>
     <l n="103">Could plunge in Superstition 's dark recess —</l>
     <l n="104">Or the red mask of Bigotry put on ;</l>

    <head>NOTES ON GUSTAVUS VASA .</head>
    <p n="1">I have prefixed to this fragment the title of Epic Poem , though epic poems are growing out of fashion ; because , in the structure , plan , and metre , the heroic model is followed . My authorities for facts , dates , and characters , are Vertot and Puffendorff . The latter I have only read in an English translation , dated 1702 : the former I quote from a small Amsterdam edition , printed for Stephen Roger , in 2 vols . 1722 .</p>

    <p n="8">Many have attributed the efforts which Gustavus made use of to deliver his country , to ambition , and a desire of reigning . Yet , since his elevation produced much good to Sweden , and no evil , it is surely allowable , if not just , to attribute them to a purer motive : at any rate , a poet is at liberty to set his hero 's character in the fairest light he can , consistently with history .</p>

    <p n="13">And her brave chief was numbered with the dead .</p>
    <p n="14">Steen Sture , Poeticè Stenon , was the son of Suante Sture , administrator of Sweden , who reduced John the Second of Denmark to conclude a treaty with him , and who is greatly extolled by historians for the extraordinary spirit , skill , and moderation , with which he governed a turbulent kingdom for many years . Sture , though a young man , was admitted his successor , being duly elected on the 21st of July , 1513 , after a violent struggle with his competitor , Eric Trolle , the senator , which laid the foundation of the enmity between him and Gustavus Trolle , the famous Primate of Sweden . On that prelate 's arrival from Rome , however , he welcomed him to his see , and behaved to him in the most courteous manner . This behaviour was repaid by Trolle with almost open hostility ; but the young administrator had spirit enough to resist his encroachments . Arcemboldi , the Pope 's Legate , and merchant of indulgences , when passing through Sweden , in execution of his gainful office , was well received by Sture , who encouraged him in his exactions , from a political motive , and even exempted him from the duty which former venders of indulgences had been accustomed to pay to the Kings and Governors of Sweden . In the war commenced by Christiern the Second against Sweden , he signalized his courage and military talents on many occasions , and was killed in an engagement with Otho Crumpein 's army , near Bogesund in East Gothland .</p>
    <p n="15">Inferior to his father as an Administrator , he appears to have equalled him only in courage and the art of war . He was one of those men who are born to adorn , though not defend , a declining state : and , in the words of the French writer , was “ fitter to command a party , than govern an empire . ” His death happened in the beginning of 1519 .</p>
    <p n="16">18 .</p>
    <p n="17">—— ruthless Christiern ——</p>
    <p n="18">Christiern the Second was perhaps the worst king that ever disgraced the Danish throne . It is difficult to find any thing estimable or admirable in his character ; he had neither the moderation of a Pisistratus , the talents of a Cæsar , nor the political prudence of an Augustus . He succeeded his father John in 1512 , and declared war against Sweden , in which he was assisted by Trolle . Having made a descent on the coast , he was repulsed by Steen Sture , and reduced to extremities . Wishing to treat with Sture , he demanded hostages for his safety ; some of the principal nobles were sent to him in that quality , and among them Gustavus Vasa . With these he immediately sailed away , and on his return , confined them in the castle of Copenhagen , excepting Gustavus , who was committed to the custody of Eric Banner . He made a second attack upon Sweden , and , after the death of Steen Sture , was crowned King of Sweden . Under false pretences , he put to death the whole Swedish senate , and exercised innumerable barbarities on the townsmen and peasants . ( Puffendorff , passim . ) Being afterwards expelled from Denmark by his uncle Prince Frederick , and from Sweden by Gustavus Vasa , after many fruitless attempts to regain possession of either kingdom , he was at last seized by Frederick , August 2 , 1532 , and confined in the Castle of Coldinger , where he died some years after .</p>

    <p n="20">‘ Twas morn , when Christiern , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="21">This poem begins in January , 1521 , immediately before the introduction of Gustavus in the assembly of Mora .</p>
    <p n="22">41 .</p>
    <p n="23">—— Upsal 's haughty Prelate ——</p>
    <p n="24">Gustavus Trolle , son of Eric the rival of Steen Sture , was sent when young to Rome ( where it is supposed he learned the art of political finesse ) , and was there consecrated Archbishop of Upsal by Leo the Tenth . On his return to Sweden , he treated with great haughtiness Steen Sture , who came to congratulate him on his elevation . He joined in Christiern 's attempts on Sweden , and , being convicted of treason by the assembled Swedish States , retired from his archiepiscopal throne to a monastery . On the successes of Christiern , however , he quitted his retirement , and , regardless of his oaths of abdication , resumed his former office . His forcible deposition was one of the pretexts for the massacre of Stockholm . He opposed Gustavus Vasa in his patriotic endeavours , and once circumvented the hero with a troop of Danes , so that he narrowly escaped with his life . Vasa , however , soon retorted the same stratagem on his enemy ; and he was at last obliged to retire into Denmark , where he with difficulty escaped death from the resentment of his master . A wound , received in an engagement with the troops of Christiern the Third , terminated the existence of one of the most restless caballers , and most accomplished statesmen , of his time .</p>
    <p n="25">119 .</p>
    <p n="26">Otho .</p>
    <p n="27">Otho Crumpein , one of the most celebrated generals of the North , was employed by Christiern in his war with Steen Sture , and gained many signal victories over the Danes ; and afterwards , by his master 's orders , invested Stockholm . He was at length removed to Denmark by the tyrant , who was jealous of his talents .</p>
    <p n="28">191 .</p>
    <p n="29">Ernestus .</p>
    <p n="30">Ernestus and Harfagar are fictitious characters . Puffendorff , however , reports that Steen Sture was killed by the treachery of one of his confidential friends .— The hint of the vision , l. 281-311 , is taken from Lucan .</p>
    <p n="31">335 .</p>
    <p n="32">Brask 's proud genius .</p>
    <p n="33">Brask , Bishop of Lincoping , was secretly a partisan of Christiern 's , and escaped the massacre of Stockholm by an artful contrivance . When the order for Trolle 's arrest was signed by the Senate and Bishops , at the instigation of Steen Sture , he added his name to the rest , but secretly slipped under the seal a note , declaring his dissent : of this he informed Christiern , when under the edge of the axe . On Gustavus 's insurrection , he at first remained neutral : afterwards , being besieged in his castle by Gustavus , he came over to him . But his invincible obstinacy and factious disposition were a great obstacle to Gustavus in the introduction of Lutheranism into his kingdom .</p>
    <p n="34">336 .</p>
    <p n="35">Bernheim .</p>
    <p n="36">Bernheim is a fictitious character .</p>
    <p n="37">337 .</p>
    <p n="38">Theodore .</p>
    <p n="39">Theodore , Archbishop of Lunden , is thus characterized by Vertot :</p>
    <p n="40">“ L'Archevêque de Lunden avoit beaucoup de part dans sa confiance . C'étoit un homme de basse naissance , sans érudition , et même sans habileté ; mais savant dans l'art d'inventer de nouveaux plaisirs , et qui en connoissoit également tous les sécrèts et les assaisonnemens . Il étoit redevable de sa faveur et de son élevation à Sigebritte ( the well-known mistress of Christiern ): elle l'avoit d'abord introduit à la cour pour lui servir d'espion : il passa ensuite tout d'un coup ( here we must suspect some exaggeration ) , par le crédit de cette femme , de la fonction de Barbier du Prince à la dignité d'Archevêque , et il se maintint dans sa faveur en presentant à Christierne des plaisirs qu'il savoit accommoder à son goût . ” P. 108 , 109 , Amst . ed .</p>
    <p n="41">Christiern , having first employed Theodore in an official commission , appointed him Administrator of Sweden in his absence . On the news of the Swedish rebellion , that prelate , fearful of losing the ample opportunities he now possessed of indulging his voluptuousness and rapacity , sent an immediate express to his master , who ordered him to assemble his army , and attack the insurgents . In conformity to these orders , he occupied an advantageous post on the banks of the river Brunebec : Gustavus was on the opposite side , and he intended to dispute the passage with him . But , through natural cowardice , or a sudden fit of alarm , he quitted his station , like Hector ; and flying for safety from one fortress to another , was at last obliged , like Trolle , to take refuge in Denmark .</p>
    <p n="42">371 .</p>
    <p n="43">The factious souls , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="44">While Christiern was exercising his cruelty towards the Swedes , the Danish nobility , offended at his usurping absolute power , combined against him under the auspices of Prince Frederic , and finally succeeded in expelling him from Denmark . The rebellion began in Jutland .</p>

    <p n="59">Gustavus was disturbed during the first years of his reign , by the restless machinations of Christiern and Trolle : but from 1532 to 1560 , when he died ( Sept. 29 ) , the kingdom enjoyed a profound peace . The same may be said of the earlier part of his son Eric 's reign .</p>

    <p n="61">The mighty seraph ceas 'd ——</p>
    <p n="62">This speech , and the whole intervention of the Guardian Genius of Sweden , is introduced in order to elevate the subject , by ascribing the calamities of Sweden to a supernatural arm , and by giving , as it were , a divine direction to the sword of Gustavus . Its more immediate use is to bring about the main design of the poem , by persuading Gustavus to relinquish his design of self-banishment , and renew his patriotic efforts .</p>

    <p n="68">Soren Norbi ( Gallicè Severin ) , one of the most renowned adherents of Christiern , was employed by him on many occasions , during the war with Steen Sture . It was by his intercession that Christina , the widow of that Governor , was saved from death . According to Vertot , he wished to marry her , and , by the means of her influence and his master 's unpopularity , procure himself elected Administrator . He also concealed many Swedish gentlemen from the rage of Christiern . He defeated the generals of Gustavus in their first attempt upon Stockholm , and afterwards routed one of that hero 's armies in Finland . But his fleet was at last burnt by the Lubeckers , under the command of Gustavus , and he was compelled to retire to Gothland , where he purposed to erect an independent kingdom of his own . This design being defeated , he continued to harass Gustavus and the Lubeckers in various ways , ‘ till they at length expelled him from Sweden . He now collected his remaining forces , and retreated to Narva , where he was seized and imprisoned by the Russians . After remaining some time in confinement , he was at length released at the instance of Charles the Fifth of Germany , in whose service he died , at the siege of Florence . According to Puffendorff , his death happened in 1539 .</p>

    <p n="80">Gustavus .</p>
    <p n="81">Gustaf Wase , or Gustavus Vasa , was the son of Eric Vasa , governor of Halland , and was cousin-german to Steen Sture . Being the grand nephew of King Canutson , he was descended from the ancient kings of Sweden . Before his confinement by Christiern , he was one of the moving springs of the state ; he assisted Sture with his counsels , which were bold and judicious , and gained a signal victory over the Danes . Christiern , receiving him as a hostage , caused him to be arrested and carried him to Denmark , where , by the request of Eric Banner , he was entrusted to the care of that nobleman . From his custody , however , he soon escaped , and traversed the various provinces of Sweden , in hopes of exciting at least some of them to assert their independence . His efforts , however , surprising and unwearied as they were , did not avail , ‘ till he arrived in the remote province of Dalecarlia . His unexpected appearance there among the peasants excited the whole province to revolt , and an army , assembled in haste , stormed the Governor 's castle , and destroyed the greater part of the garrison . After this beginning , his successes gradually increased , and Angermanland , Helsingland , Gestricia , and other governments almost immediately came over to his party . He sustained a war against the whole powers of Christiern for some years in a most skilful and indefatigable manner , and succeeded at last in expelling Christiern , Trolle , and Norbi , from the land of which he was now elected monarch . A task , scarcely less difficult , remained — to extirpate the Catholic religion from Sweden . This he effected , and established Lutheranism on so firm a basis , that it has resisted all attempts to shake it . After a long and really glorious reign , he was succeeded by his son Eric the Fourteenth , in 1560 . In him were combined all the qualities necessary to constitute a hero ; he was enterprising , vigilant , proof against pleasures , brave , prudent , and generous . He erected Sweden to a degree of power and respectability unknown before , and laid the foundation for the victories of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles the Twelfth . For the particular events of his life and reign , see Vertot , Puffendorff , the Encyclopædia Britannica , and most modern histories .</p>

    <p n="90">The successor of Margaret . He is called the thirteenth by Vertot , though according to other accounts he was but the tenth or eleventh .</p>
    <p n="91">198 .</p>
    <p n="92">‘ Twas then , when , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="93">The Massacre of Stockholm , as it is commonly called , happened on the 8th of November , 1520 . Of this almost unparalleled act of baseness and cruelty , Vertot ( p. 113 , 114 , 115 , Amst . ed . ) gives the following account , from Zigler , who was an eye-witness , and many other authors of credit . The pretext for this execution was the demolishing of Stecka , a castle belonging to the traitor Trolle , which the Swedish States had ordered to be rased , contrary to the bull of Leo the Tenth .</p>
    <p n="94">“ Le nouveau Roi fit ensuite inviter tout ces Seigneurs à une fête magnifique qu'il fit dans le château , pour marquer la joie de son avènement a la couronne . Le Sénat en corps , et ce qu'il y avoit de Seigneurs de la première noblesse , à Stocolme , ne manquèrent pas de s'y rendre : ce ne fut pendant les deux premiers jours que festins , que jeux , que plaisirs ; Christierne affectoit des manières pleines de bonté et de familiarité ; il sembloit qu'on eût enseveli dans la bonne chère la haine et l'aversion que les deux parties avoient fait paroître si long-tems l'une contre l'autre ; tout le monde s'abandonnoit tranquillement à la joie , lors que , le troisième jour , les Suédois furent tirés de cet excès de securité , d'une maniere bien funeste . ”</p>
    <p n="95">He then proceeds to relate the proceedings of the Danish Monarch against the Nobility , in the way of accusation , by means of his ministers the Danish Bishops , and the Pope 's Bull ; and having described their pleas , &amp; c. thus continues :</p>
    <p n="96">“ Ce Prince sortit ensuite de l'Assemblée , comme s'il cut voulu laisser la liberté aux commissaires de délibérer : mais en même tems on vit entrer une troupe de soldats de ses gardes , qui arrêtoient la veuve de l'Administrateur ( Christina ) , les Senateurs , les Evêques même , et tout ce qui se trouva de Seigneurs et de Gentilshommes Suédois dans le château .</p>
    <p n="97">“ Les Evêques Danois , commissaires du Pape , commencèrent à instruire leur procès comme à des héretiques , et comme s'ils eussent êté en pays d'inquisition ; mais la procedure étant trop longue pour des gens qui étoient déjà condamnés , Christierne , dans la crainte qu'il ne se fît quelque revolte en leur faveur , leur envoya des bourreaux sans autre formalité , pour leur annoncer qu'il falloit mourir .</p>
    <p n="98">“ Le huitième de Novembre fut destiné pour leur supplice ; on entendit dès le matin des trompettes et des hérauts de la part du Prince , qui défendoient à qui que ce fût de sortir de la ville , sous peine de la vie : toute la garrison étoit sous les armes : il y avoit des corps de garde aux portes , et dans toutes les places . Le canon prêt à tirer étoit dans la grande place , la bouche tournée contre les principals rues ; tout le monde étoit dans une profonde consternation ; ou ne savoit à quoi aboutiroient ces mouvemens extraordinaires , lorsque sur le midi ou vit ouvrir les portes du château , et , au travers de deux files de soldats , des illustres prisonniers , la plupart encore avec les marques de leur dignité , conduits à la mort par des bourreaux .</p>
    <p n="99">“ Si-tôt qu'ils furent arrivés au lieu de leur supplice , un officier Danois lût tout haut la bulle du pape , comme l'arrêt de leur condemnation , et il ajouta que dans le châtiment des coupables , le Roi ne faisoit rien que par l'ordonnance des commissaires apostoliques , et que suivant le conseil de l'Archevèque d'Upsal . Les Evêques condamnés , et les autres prisonniers , demandèrent avec instance des confesseurs ; mais Christierne leur refusa cette consolation avec beaucoup d'inhumanité , soit que ce Prince trouvât un rafinement de vengeance à étendre son ressentiment sur les choses de l'autre vie , où qu'il ne voulût pas qu'on traitât en Catholiques des gens qu'on venoit de condamner comme héretiques : il sacrifia par la même politique ses amis et ses partisans , pour n'être pas soupçonné d'avoir fait périr ses ennemis : toute l'ardeur et tout le zêle que les Evêques de Stregnez et de Scara avoient fait paroître pour ses interêts , ne purent les exempter de la mort , la qualité de Sénateurs leur coûta la vie , et la signature qu'ils avoient mise à la condamnation de l'Archevêque avec les autres Sénateurs , fut la prétexte de leur supplice . ”</p>
    <p n="100">( He mentions here the stratagem of Bishop Brask , related in a former note . )</p>
    <p n="101">“ On exécuta ensuite ” ( i. e . after the execution of the Bishops ) “ tous les Senateurs seculiers : on commença par Eric Vasa , père de Gustave ; les Consules et les Magistrats de Stocolme , et quatre-vingt quatorze Senateurs , qui avoient été arrêtés dans le Chateau , eurent la même destinée .</p>
    <p n="102">“ Le Roi n'apprit qu'avec un violent chagrin qu'on n'avoit pû faire périr quelques Seigneurs qu'il avoit proscrits particulièrement , et qu'on croyoit qu'ils étoient cachés dans la ville . La crainte qu'ils n'échappassent , et l'espérance de décourrir la rétraite de Gustave , qu'il soupçonnoit d'être caché dans Stocolme , lui fit confondre les innocens avec les coupables . Il abandonna la ville à la fureur de ses troupes : les soldats se jettèrent d'abord sur le peuple qui étoit accoura à ce triste spectacle : ils frappoient et ils tuoient indifferemment tous ceux qui étoient assez malheureux pour se rencoutrer à leur chemin : ils passèrent ensuite dans les meilleurs maisons de la ville , sous prétexte de chercher Gustave et les autres proscrits ; ils poignardoient les bourgeois jusque dans les bras de leur femmes ; les maisons furent mises au pillage , et la pudicité des femmes et des filles exposée à la brutalité des soldats . Rien ne fut épargué que la laideur et la pauvreté : tout le reste devint la proie du soldat furieux , qui , sous les ordres et à l'exemple de son souverain , se faisoit un mérite de sa fureur et de son emportement . ”</p>

    <p n="139">The Supreme Being commands the Genius of Sweden to lull the Danish garrison of Dalecarlia into false security , to invigorate the drooping spirits of the Dalecarlians , and to assist and increase the army of Prince Frederic of Denmark by means of various rumours , &amp; c .— The Genius dispatches a fiend to execute the first commission , while he hastens to perform the second .— Transition to Gustavus .— He finds his sword , but misses Ernestus , by means of a storm which the whirlwind had excited .— His reflections .— Taking shelter under the roof of a cottage ; he there overhears a party of young men , with Adolphus at their head , exclaiming against the dilatory measures of the seniors , and resolving on more vigorous plans .— He joins them , without disclosing himself , and bids them report to the council , that a stranger will appear in the public assembly of Dalecarlia , the following day , and notify things which may influence their counsels .— He retires : Adolphus follows him unseen .— The youths , returning to the assembly , find their elders watching the event of an augury , mentioned in the Third Book .— Its process described — the result .— The young men announce their message .— Reflections of the Dalecarlians on it .— Gustavus meets Ernestus , and prepares to attack him , but is prevented by a miraculous sign .— The Genius of Sweden , after having revived the spirits of the Dalecarlians , passes to Denmark , where he influences the Danes to join the standards of Prince Frederic of Oldenburg .— Description of that Prince 's court , and of the state of Denmark .— The Genius returns through Sweden .— Account of what was passing there .</p>

    <p n="143">BOOK THE SIXTH .</p>
    <p n="144">Gustavus recounts the causes of the war , and its progress , prior to the capitulation of Stockholm ; which will afford much room for detail . This narration is necessary , to acquaint the reader with what happened before the commencement of the action , and is therefore similar in design to the second and third Æneid , and the four narrative books of the Odyssey . Christiern , Steen Sture , Archbishop Trolle , Otho , Norbi , and other distinguished characters , will make a figure in this relation . The hero describes the massacre of Stockholm , from the account of an eye-witness of that catastrophe .— He enlarges on the death of his father Eric . Some reflections on this event may be introduced , in imitation of Lucan .— Fate of Gustavus 's wife and sister ; whose death , and the intercession made by Christiern with Gustavus for their preservation , will afterwards form one of the principal episodes .— He then relates part of his numerous adventures in the different provinces of Sweden .</p>
    <p n="145">BOOK THE SEVENTH .</p>
    <p n="146">He continues his recital , and concludes with his arrival in Dalecarlia , and adventures there . He then exhorts them to assist in his patriotic design . ( See his speech in Vertot . ) The Dalecarlians applaud his harangue , which is also attended by favourable omens . A body-guard of 400 men is appointed him ; Adolphus is chosen captain , having now returned , and disclosed the supineness and neglect of the Danish garrison . Gustavus declares his intentions of storming the castle ; arranges the troops , and bids all be ready by midnight . They retire .</p>
    <p n="147">BOOK THE EIGHTH .</p>
    <p n="148">The proceedings of Christiern , Trolle , and Norbi , from the conclusion of Book 4 , severally described .— Gustavus secretly dismisses the unfaithful tribes .— The Genius of Sweden appears to him in a dream ; foretels his future exaltation , and the disgraceful end of Christiern and his party . He then shews him the reward of patriots in heaven .— Ancient Swedish kings and heroes .</p>
    <p n="149">BOOK THE NINTH .</p>
    <p n="150">He now shews him , “ in a sort of Pisgah-sight , ” as Pope expresses it , but on a new plan , the future history of Sweden : its wars , arts , manners , &amp; c .— Gustavus Adolphus .— Christina .— Charles the Twelfth .— Puffendorff , Oxenstiern , Linnæus , &amp; c .— Part of the Danish history may be mentioned , as connected with that of Sweden .— Gustavas the Fourth .— Siege of Copenhagen by the English .— Bernadotte .— The Genius concludes with an exhortation , and directions for prosecuting the war .— Gustavus 's prayer .— The army described .— Their leaders .</p>
    <p n="151">BOOK THE TENTH .</p>

    <p n="153">The action , from the council in Book 1 , to the taking of the castle , in Book 10 , occupies four days .</p>
    <p n="154">The remaining books , ten or fourteen in number , will be occupied with a detail of the long and various war waged by Gustavus against Christiern , and the poem will conclude with his coronation . Many events afford great scope for poetry ; such as the hero 's constancy under his defeat by Trolle , his subsequent victory over that prelate , the adventures of Steen Sture 's widow , the death of Gustavus 's mother and sister , the burning of Norbi 's fleet , the coronation of Gustavus , &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="155">NOTES ON THE OTHER POEMS .</p>

    <p n="161">An intelligent person suggested to the author , that to compose a new version of Homer , in the style and measure of Scott 's Marmion , would be a feasible idea . He observed , that Scott 's style , and his circumstantial descriptions , bore much resemblance to those of Homer and that the rapid flow of Scott 's verse was happily accommodated to the swift succession of events , and fiery impetuosity of the Iliad ; corresponding with the dactylic hexameter of the old poet . These hints induced the author to attempt the above translation .</p>
