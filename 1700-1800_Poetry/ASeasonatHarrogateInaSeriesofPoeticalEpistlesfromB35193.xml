   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>That admirable production of Mr. Anstey 's the “ New Bath Guide , ” may justly be considered the parent of a numerous progeny of watering place bagatelles , each of which has some resemblance to its father , though not one of them can boast the wit , humour , or poetical talent which so eminently distinguishes those celebrated letters .</p>
   <p>The youngest of this race is now presented to the Public with that timidity which arises from conscious imperfection , devoid of the fear which rivalry has endeavoured to excite , and persecution may seek to perpetuate . Neither nurtured by patronage nor dandled by fashion , neither supported by rank nor allied to literary honours , this child of obscurity is cast on the world in a helpless , yet not hopeless state , for the good man 's smile has illumed its cradle , and it possesses that confidence derived from purity of intention , and that humility which disarms malice , and draws the sting of criticism .</p>

     <l n="3">‘ Tis now forty years and dear mother you know it ,</l>
     <l n="4">Since my great Uncle<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Simkin set up for a poet ,</l>
     <l n="5">And I 'll venture to say that not one in the nation ,</l>
     <l n="6">From that day to this caus 'd so much admiration ,</l>
     <l n="7">But tho ’ I ne'er hope on his humour to hit ,</l>
     <l n="8">Much less catch his genius or glow with his wit ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or blend with simplicity satire so keen ,</l>
     <l n="10">That it laugh 'd away sin , while it laugh 'd away spleen ,</l>
     <l n="11">Yet since there are many more folks in our times ,</l>
     <l n="12">Than were found about his , who make verses and rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="13">I do n't see a reason why I should not try ,</l>
     <l n="14">To spread my poor fins and to swim with the fry ,</l>
     <l n="15">You know Drewry of Derby would never refuse ,</l>
     <l n="16">My sonnets , and stanzas , a place in the news ,</l>
     <l n="17">Besides a great name 's a great matter we know ,</l>
     <l n="18">James Thompson our schoolmaster always said so ,</l>
     <l n="19">And thought it the best of a hundred good reasons ,</l>
     <l n="20">Why he should write verses as fine as ‘ The Seasons ’</l>
     <l n="21">Now I being last of the Blunderhead race ,</l>
     <l n="22">As a casuist this doctrine most warmly embrace ,</l>
     <l n="23">And hope my dear mother the parson and you ,</l>
     <l n="24">Whilst conning my letters will give me my due ,</l>
     <l n="25">And say to reward all my labour and pains ,</l>
     <l n="26">He is just like his uncle save wanting his brains .</l>
     <l n="27">But a truce to this subject of grave declamation ,</l>
     <l n="28">My spirit 's not suited to sage dissertation ,</l>
     <l n="29">To anatomists leaving the state of my skull ,</l>
     <l n="30">To critics their right of pronouncing me dull ,</l>
     <l n="31">I shall merely go on with my gossiping rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="32">To tell you my method of killing my time ,</l>
     <l n="33">And open as well as I can all the merit ,</l>
     <l n="34">This place of resort is allow 'd to inherit . 32</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">When first I arriv 'd here I did n't well know ,</l>
     <l n="36">If at Harrogate High , or at Harrogate Low ,</l>
     <l n="37">I should place myself snugly , but after some chatter ,</l>
     <l n="38">With those who were knowing , I fix 'd on the latter</l>
     <l n="39">So now my good madam behold me sat down ,</l>
     <l n="40">With a number of invalid folks at the Crown ,</l>
     <l n="41">But what way invalid to unfold I 'm not able ,</l>
     <l n="42">Unless ‘ tis with cramming at Thackwray 's good table ,</l>
     <l n="43">Who with turbot , and ven'son , and poultry , and beef ,</l>
     <l n="44">To the sick with their hunger gives instant relief ,</l>
     <l n="45">But as to the crop-sick I very much question ,</l>
     <l n="46">If here they find help for diseas 'd indigestion ,</l>
     <l n="47">The sight of these good things to me was unpleasant ,</l>
     <l n="48">For you know I am ticklish and qualmish at present</l>
     <l n="49">But the Company laugh and declare I shall soon eat ,</l>
     <l n="50">Three pounds of good food , tho ’ I now live on spoonmeat ,</l>
     <l n="51">And in order to bring me about very quickly ,</l>
     <l n="52">Some good looking dames neither sighing nor sickly ,</l>
     <l n="53">Advis 'd me most kindly the very first night ,</l>
     <l n="54">To consult with a doctor as soon as ‘ twas light ,</l>
     <l n="55">Then take of the water a plentiful dose ,</l>
     <l n="56">Said they “ the well 's nigh ” so I find by my nose ,</l>
     <l n="57">“ But pray gentle ladies declare in a trice ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ The doctor of whom I must ask this advice ? ” 56</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="59">This question once put t'would surprise you dear mother ,</l>
     <l n="60">How they answer 'd at once each more loud than the other ,</l>
     <l n="61">“ There 's not one of them all that my fancy so takes ”</l>
     <l n="62">“ Cried a lady in black ” “ as my good Doctor Jaques , ”</l>
     <l n="63">Says the next “ Mr. Richardson 's wonderful clever ,</l>
     <l n="64">Tho ’ so busy dear heart there 's no catching him ever , ”</l>
     <l n="65">Cries a third “ if you really want medical skill ,</l>
     <l n="66">Mr. Wormald will cure you if any man will , ”</l>
     <l n="67">“ And I know ” “ said a fourth ” “ that whatever may ail ye ,</l>
     <l n="68">“ You 're sure of relief if you see Doctor Cayley . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="69">Afraid of offending each charming adviser ,</l>
     <l n="70">By a pref'rence that said “ ma'am your neighbour is wiser , ”</l>
     <l n="71">I obey 'd the loud mandate of Gen'ral O'Flurry ,</l>
     <l n="72">And this morning consulted with one Doctor Murray</l>
     <l n="73">Who sans ruffles , sans wig , and sans avis supercilious ,</l>
     <l n="74">Has pronounc 'd on my case and declares I am bilious ,</l>
     <l n="75">In my next dearest mother some news I will tell ,</l>
     <l n="76">Of these wonderful waters when drank at the well</l>
     <l n="77">So wishing you ne'er may have need of such liquor</l>

     <l n="2">Oh ! how my dear mother shall pen , ink , and paper</l>
     <l n="3">Convey to your mind a true sense of the vapour ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which hov'ring around this new Acheron serves ,</l>
     <l n="5">To torture and wound your olfactory nerves ,</l>
     <l n="6">And gives you presentiment piercing and strong ,</l>
     <l n="7">Of its pungent effects when receiv 'd on the tongue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">Of rotten eggs , brimstone , and salts make a hash ,</l>
     <l n="9">And ‘ twill form something like this delectable mash</l>
     <l n="10">Nothing else in this world I will wager a pasty ,</l>
     <l n="11">So good in effect , ever tasted so nasty .</l>
     <l n="12">But ah ! tis the pencil of Bunb'ry alone ,</l>
     <l n="13">By which the sweet stream and its pow'rs can be shewn ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nor does the whole kingdom afford I am sure ,</l>
     <l n="15">One scene like this well for a caricature ,</l>
     <l n="16">All ages , and sexes , all ranks , and degree ,</l>
     <l n="17">All forms , and all sizes distorted you see ,</l>
     <l n="18">Some grinning , some splutt'ring , some pulling wry faces ,</l>
     <l n="19">In short ‘ tis a mart for all sorts of grimaces ,</l>
     <l n="20">But all you conceive , of age , infancy , youth ,</l>
     <l n="21">In contortion and whim must fall short of the truth ,</l>
     <l n="22">One screws up his lips like the mouth of a purse ,</l>
     <l n="23">While his neighbour 's fierce grin gives the threat of a curse ,</l>
     <l n="24">And a third gasping begs with his eyes turn 'd to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="25">That his stomach will keep what so lately was given</l>
     <l n="26">But feeling the rebel will spurn at his pray'r ,</l>
     <l n="27">Throws the rest of his bumper away in despair .</l>
     <l n="28">But woe to the wight of more delicate notions ,</l>
     <l n="29">When he sees how the well-women deal out their potions ,</l>
     <l n="30">This levelling tribe of a democrat race ,</l>
     <l n="31">From the red nos 'd postillion , up to her Grace</l>
     <l n="32">Feeds each from one glass , without washing , or rincing ,</l>
     <l n="33">And the sybil but laughs if you make any wincing ,</l>
     <l n="34">From the modest who issue from cheap Mrs. Binns ’</l>
     <l n="35">To the great ones who drive from High Harrogate Inns ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where a difference far more essential is found ,</l>
     <l n="37">From the sick , to the well , the same cup travels round ,</l>
     <l n="38">From breath that would poison a Hottentot king</l>
     <l n="39">To breath that is sweeter than violets in spring ,</l>
     <l n="40">But as sulphur prohibits all sorts of infection ,</l>
     <l n="41">The rational say “ there 's no proper objection , 116</l>
     <l n="42">To mingling en masse with all sorts of diseases ,</l>
     <l n="43">Tho ’ the stomach may make what objection she pleases . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="44">Now turn my dear mother with me and survey</l>
     <l n="45">This company blended of grave and of gay ,</l>
     <l n="46">See Alderman Gobble , and Counsellor Puffing ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who came to this well as a penance for stuffing ,</l>
     <l n="48">And poor Captain Brandylove come to recruit ,</l>
     <l n="49">Swears the Cognac grape was the forbidden fruit ,</l>
     <l n="50">Here gentlemen jockies who ride into fevers ,</l>
     <l n="51">And surfeits obtain from their noble endeavours ,</l>
     <l n="52">Such as Timothy Twig'em Esquire of our town ,</l>
     <l n="53">And my Lord Spatterdashit that peer of renown ,</l>
     <l n="54">And Sir Gilbert O'Fetlock with coach driving coat ,</l>
     <l n="55">With many more whips of distinction and note ,</l>
     <l n="56">Come swarming around just to take off their glasses ,</l>
     <l n="57">Make matches for horses , and bets upon asses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="58">But here come a group whose deplorable faces ,</l>
     <l n="59">E'en surfeit itself would illumine with graces ,</l>
     <l n="60">See poor Major Liverless come from Bombay ,</l>
     <l n="61">To send his sharp bile and black jaundice away ,</l>
     <l n="62">And gripe the contractor , who ruin 'd his health ,</l>
     <l n="63">While he sold ( silly booby ) his conscience for wealth</l>
     <l n="64">For Escarides every physician will tell ,</l>
     <l n="65">There 's no med'cine on earth like the Harrogate well ,</l>
     <l n="66">But the worm which gnaws gripe will ne'er yield to its mixture ,</l>
     <l n="67">‘ Tis lodg 'd in the heart an indelible fixture ,</l>
     <l n="68">But truce to my preaching — who makes his approach</l>
     <l n="69">In such dashing array , and so splendid a coach ?</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Tis the great Doctor Solomon stooping to take ,</l>
     <l n="71">A dose of this water by way of a freak , 148</l>
     <l n="72">Tho ’ all the world knows that his own balmy bottle ,</l>
     <l n="73">( More warm to the heart and more sweet to the throttle )</l>
     <l n="74">Not only cures patients but makes ‘ em so merry ,</l>
     <l n="75">One spoonful is worth a whole bottle of sherry .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="76">All hail to Britannia ! her plentiful hive ,</l>
     <l n="77">Has taught many bees like this doctor to thrive ,</l>
     <l n="78">But from all I can learn not one quack shares her honey ,</l>
     <l n="79">More deserving than this , since he 's free with his money ,</l>
     <l n="80">“ Easy come easy go ” is his motto I 'm told ,</l>
     <l n="81">Tho ’ his daughters are portion 'd with ingots of gold</l>
     <l n="82">But I scorn upon men any more to descant ,</l>
     <l n="83">For the Blunderheads always were very gallant ,</l>
     <l n="84">And if beauty and fashion e'er claim 'd admiration ,</l>
     <l n="85">From the heart of a man since the days of creation ,</l>
     <l n="86">I 'm sure at this time there 's the very best reason ,</l>
     <l n="87">To exult in the beauty that blooms here this season ,</l>
     <l n="88">E'en now on parade I delighted behold ,</l>
     <l n="89">Five elegant sisters of exquisite mould ,</l>
     <l n="90">There too are the C — tt — rs sweet innocent creatures ,</l>
     <l n="91">With peace in their bosoms and love in their features</l>
     <l n="92">And the beautiful L — nds and the L — kes too appear</l>
     <l n="93">Like goddesses dropt from a delicate sphere ;</l>
     <l n="94">Yet mid the assemblage M — cd — nald we trace ,</l>
     <l n="95">No charmer that equals thy form or thy face ,</l>
     <l n="96">Tho ’ W — m — ld such majesty dwells in thy mien ,</l>
     <l n="97">And in W — ts — n 's mild eyes such true sweetness is seen ,</l>
     <l n="98">That really my muse is perplex 'd to declare ,</l>
     <l n="99">How one can excel where so many are fair ,</l>
     <l n="100">Oh woman ! dear woman ! without you all nature ,</l>
     <l n="101">Would be to my mind like a draught of this water ,</l>
     <l n="102">And may he whose cold heart and dull head would disprove ,</l>
     <l n="103">The magic of beauty the solace of love ,</l>
     <l n="104">And seek from rude man your soft claims to dissever ,</l>
     <l n="105">Be condemn 'd without mercy to drink it for ever ,</l>
     <l n="106">Ye are stars of the night ! ye are gems of the morn !</l>
     <l n="107">Ye are dew-drops whose lustre illumines the thorn !</l>
     <l n="108">And rayless that night is — that morning unblest ,</l>
     <l n="109">Where no beam in your eye lights up bliss in the breast ,</l>
     <l n="110">And the sharp thorn of sorrow sinks deep in the heart</l>
     <l n="111">Till the sweet lip of woman assuages the smart ,</l>
     <l n="112">‘ Tis her 's o'er the couch of misfortune to bend ,</l>
     <l n="113">In fondness a lover , in firmness a friend ,</l>
     <l n="114">And prosperity 's hour be it ever confest ,</l>
     <l n="115">From woman receives both refinement and zest ,</l>
     <l n="116">And adorn 'd by the bays or enwreath 'd with the willow</l>
     <l n="117">Her smile is our meed , and her bosom our pillow .</l>
     <l n="118">But ah ! my good mother this subject I find ,</l>
     <l n="119">Has quite run away with my paper and mind ,</l>
     <l n="120">For in themes so bewitching so many thoughts pop in</l>
     <l n="121">The mania of scribbling finds no place to stop in ,</l>
     <l n="122">But in praising the ladies you can n't think me rude ,</l>
     <l n="123">So adieu till my next — ‘ tis high time to conclude .</l>

     <l n="5">To pick up my crumbs with the best at the table ,</l>
     <l n="6">And now think the landlord a very wise man ,</l>
     <l n="7">For placing thereon all the dishes he can ,</l>
     <l n="8">No longer fastidious or squeamish or dainty ,</l>
     <l n="9">I like all I see and rejoice that there 's plenty ,</l>
     <l n="10">But since I wrote last by my doctor 's prescription ,</l>
     <l n="11">I 've had a warm bath of which take my description</l>
     <l n="12">Fair Derwent how oft in thy pure limpid wave ,</l>
     <l n="13">Delighted I lov 'd in full freedom to lave ,</l>
     <l n="14">While on thy green banks in soft herbage reposing ,</l>
     <l n="15">The swains and their flocks , were contentedly dosing</l>
     <l n="16">And the landscape around , and above the blue sky</l>
     <l n="17">Shed new life on the heart while they solac 'd the eye</l>
     <l n="18">Little thought I in those days so sunny and smiling ,</l>
     <l n="19">What a different thing was a Harrogate boiling ,</l>
     <l n="20">And astonish 'd I saw when I came to my doffing<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>,</l>
     <l n="21">A tub of hot water made just like a coffin ,</l>
     <l n="22">In which the good woman who tended the bath ,</l>
     <l n="23">Declar 'd I must lie down as straight as a lath ,</l>
     <l n="24">Just keeping my face above water that so ,</l>
     <l n="25">I might better inhale the fine fume from below ,</l>
     <l n="26">“ But mistress , ” ‘ quoth I in a trembling condition , ’</l>
     <l n="27">“ I hope you 'll allow me one small requisition ,</l>
     <l n="28">Since scrophula , leprosy , herpes , and scurvy ,</l>

     <l n="36">So caviller like I submitted to pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="37">And was coddled in troth for the third of an hour .</l>
     <l n="38">But that very same night to atone for it all ,</l>
     <l n="39">I figur 'd away the first man at the ball ,</l>
     <l n="40">For the president being both idle and lusty ,</l>
     <l n="41">Conceiv 'd that his pow'rs “ a la danse ” were grown rusty ,</l>
     <l n="42">And consign 'd all his rights in this gay exhibition ,</l>
     <l n="43">To myself as a man of more able condition ,</l>
     <l n="44">But oh ! how it griev 'd me dear mother to find ,</l>
     <l n="45">So very few beaux were to dancing inclin 'd ;</l>
     <l n="46">Constellations of beauty all night shone in vain ,</l>
     <l n="47">Condemn 'd as fix 'd stars unremov 'd to remain ,</l>
     <l n="48">Whose influence benignant ne'er reach 'd from their sphere ,</l>
     <l n="49">To warm the cold heels of the gentlemen here ,</l>
     <l n="50">Captain — r — r consider 'd a man of high ton ,</l>
     <l n="51">All dancing declin 'd till the ball was just done ,</l>
     <l n="52">And then he made shift just to drawl on his legs ,</l>
     <l n="53">As a lame Chelsea pensioner does when he begs ,</l>
     <l n="54">But in spite of his ennui and indolent air</l>
     <l n="55">He dances divinely the ladies declare . 258</l>
     <l n="56">Of these tho ’ a great many caper 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="57">Yet many sat still who were lovely as they ,</l>
     <l n="58">Fair F — z — r was there , and the beautiful P — k — r</l>
     <l n="59">With the elegant H — tt — n as lovely tho ’ darker ,</l>
     <l n="60">The gay A — x — nd — r and R — g — rs the pretty ,</l>
     <l n="61">And M — w — r the graceful , and B — ley the witty .</l>
     <l n="62">Some came from the Granby and some from the Dragon ,</l>
     <l n="63">But these are all belles that our own house may brag on ,</l>
     <l n="64">For at present the Crown is much fuller than any ,</l>
     <l n="65">Tho ’ the Inns at High Harrogate boast a good many</l>
     <l n="66">The Crescent our neighbour is full to o'erflowing ,</l>
     <l n="67">And numbers I see to the White Hart are going .</l>
     <l n="68">As bad as the times are John Bull makes a shift ,</l>
     <l n="69">To give the gay world an effectual lift ,</l>
     <l n="70">And so long as these places can live by their trading</l>

     <l n="89">To make out my meaning by shrugs and grimaces ,</l>
     <l n="90">Thus a man without reading may give an opinion ,</l>

     <l n="112">On wonderful plans for complete reformation ,</l>

     <l n="116">Or deeply regret these degenerate times ,</l>
     <l n="117">Produce prose without sense , without poetry rhymes</l>
     <l n="118">Step on to consider the faults of the stage</l>
     <l n="119">And conclude there 's not one decent thing in the age .</l>
     <l n="120">Thus as sung my great uncle “ our evil , and good ,</l>

     <l n="2">Since I wrote to you last my dear mother I 've been</l>
     <l n="3">To see all the lions which are to be seen</l>
     <l n="4">Around this gay place — where ‘ tis much in the fashion ,</l>
     <l n="5">Small parties to form for this sweet recreation ,</l>
     <l n="6">So we lately set out on a very fine day ,</l>
     <l n="7">Our respects to the beauties of Knaresbro ’ to pay , 342</l>
     <l n="8">But a painter alone to your eye can disclose ,</l>
     <l n="9">A view of the scene as before us it rose ,</l>
     <l n="10">Presenting a coup d'oeil so simple and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="11">Yet so grand , so sublime , and in fact so complete ,</l>
     <l n="12">That I fancied the river as winding around ,</l>
     <l n="13">Was enclosing the spot as if consecrate ground</l>
     <l n="14">And this castle crown 'd scene will ne'er rise to my mind ,</l>
     <l n="15">Without claiming a sigh that I 've left it behind ,</l>
     <l n="16">Thro ’ a beautiful grove we were led to be shewn ,</l>
     <l n="17">The fam 'd Dropping-Well which turns all things to stone ,</l>
     <l n="18">Yet in silver ton 'd tinkling the Naiad departs ,</l>
     <l n="19">Like ladies whose tears only harden their hearts .</l>
     <l n="20">From thence to the cell<span corresp="#note4" type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>of a saint we ascended ,</l>
     <l n="21">By sage antiquarians most highly commended ,</l>
     <l n="22">Then climb 'd to the Fort where an honest old pair ,</l>
     <l n="23">Would give you more pleasure than any thing there</l>
     <l n="24">Tho ’ their mutual labours have spread o'er the soil ,</l>
     <l n="25">Astonishing proofs of their patience and toil .</l>
     <l n="26">We trac 'd the bold ruins still proudly sublime ,</l>
     <l n="27">Which yielding to man have found mercy from time ,</l>
     <l n="28">And adorn the sweet scenes they were rais 'd to protect ,</l>
     <l n="29">With picturesque beauty more fine from defect ;</l>
     <l n="30">Delighted to find wheresoever we roved</l>
     <l n="31">“ His<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Honour of Scriven ” revered and beloved</l>
     <l n="32">As e'er his forefathers have been in those ages ,</l>
     <l n="33">When the smile of the lord was more priz 'd than his wages ,</l>
     <l n="34">When the sire of the land in the heart of each vassal</l>
     <l n="35">Found a bulwark more strong than the walls of his castle ——</l>
     <l n="36">From Knaresbro ’ to Plumpton our party proceeded</l>
     <l n="37">A spot that no trav'ller should pass by unheeded , 374</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Tis a miniature landscape redeem 'd from the waste</l>
     <l n="39">As a species of show-box by nature and taste ,</l>
     <l n="40">Of small rocks and small groves and a pretty small lake ,</l>
     <l n="41">Where small parties aquatic excursions may take ,</l>
     <l n="42">And fancy they view in perspective the shores ,</l>
     <l n="43">Where Loch Lomond smiles or Geneva deplores .—</l>
     <l n="44">So well my first jaunt had agreed with my mood ,</l>
     <l n="45">That I went to see Harewood the first day I cou 'd , 380</l>
     <l n="46">But here my description must certainly fail as ,</l>
     <l n="47">I have not one talent for painting a palace ,</l>
     <l n="48">But to draw the proud mansion and bring it to view</l>
     <l n="49">Will surely dear mother be needless to you ,</l>
     <l n="50">Since at Chatsworth we Derbyshire folks have all been ,</l>
     <l n="51">You will judge I am certain of all that I mean ,</l>
     <l n="52">When I tell you groves , gardens , fine water , and hall ,</l>
     <l n="53">Seem the gift of good Genii to spangle this ball .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="54">To Studley far-fam 'd for its beauty we went 389</l>
     <l n="55">And gaz 'd on those beauties with placid content ,</l>
     <l n="56">Tho ’ some of the amateurs fancied that art ,</l>
     <l n="57">In planning these grounds had o'er acted her part ,</l>
     <l n="58">But who hallow 'd Fountains thy threshold shall pass</l>
     <l n="59">And remember the ponds with their trimmings of grass ?</l>
     <l n="60">No ! rapt in the scene which presents contemplation ,</l>
     <l n="61">Such objects of interest and deep veneration ,</l>
     <l n="62">We gaze on the arch whence the ivy descending ,</l>
     <l n="63">Usurps the rich shrine where the lamp was once pending ,</l>
     <l n="64">Where the wild currant blooms and the mountain ash bows ,</l>
     <l n="65">There knelt the great abbot and offer 'd his vows , 400</l>
     <l n="66">And where the green beech his proud branches displays</l>
     <l n="67">Sweet incense ascended with anthems of praise .</l>

     <l n="71">The pleasure I took in these scenes at the time ,</l>
     <l n="72">For sure ‘ twas a pity that feelings so fine</l>
     <l n="73">Should evap'rate the moment we set off to dine ,</l>
     <l n="74">Reducing at once the fine flights of the brain ,</l>
     <l n="75">To the vulgar subjection of hunger , and pain ,</l>
     <l n="76">Unlike to those heroes we read of in books ,</l>
     <l n="77">Who living on sentiment scorn meat and cooks ,</l>
     <l n="78">Fight , conquer , make love to a princess , and win her ,</l>
     <l n="79">Without ever asking the aid of a dinner ,</l>
     <l n="80">And heroines we see thro ’ five volumes can go ,</l>
     <l n="81">Immers 'd in all sorts of distraction and woe ,</l>
     <l n="82">Without wetting their lips , thus bestowing the lie ,</l>
     <l n="83">On the proverb which says that “ true sorrow is dry . ”</l>
     <l n="84">But be that their affair ‘ twas no part of our plan ,</l>
     <l n="85">For our beaux grew voracious , our ladies look 'd wan</l>
     <l n="86">So we set off for Rippon with stomachs so hearty ,</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Twas well Mrs. Robinson knew of the party ,</l>
     <l n="88">She gave us a treat which so gladden 'd our sight ,</l>
     <l n="89">That we quickly determin 'd to stay here all night</l>
     <l n="90">So I thought it was best just to empty my head ,</l>
     <l n="91">Of its “ perilous stuff ” ere I ventur 'd to bed ,</l>
     <l n="92">Lest the walk I have taken with gazing and peeping</l>
     <l n="93">Should injure my nerves and prevent me from sleeping ,</l>

     <l n="9">Bare martyrdom well while the toast they were proving ;</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Since the world and all in it are subject to changing ,</l>
     <l n="3">I hope my dear mother you 'll pardon my ranging ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor think it surprising to find your son plac 'd</l>
     <l n="5">‘ Mongst the very first people for fashion , and taste ,</l>
     <l n="6">You must know that last week to read novels I took</l>
     <l n="7">And had stepp 'd up to Wilson 's to get a new book ,</l>
     <l n="8">When who should I hear in the reading-room laughing ,</l>
     <l n="9">But our Yeomanry Col'nel and Major O'Baffin ;</l>
     <l n="10">So I stepp 'd to the first with a very low bow ,</l>
     <l n="11">And he was transported to see me I vow ,</l>
     <l n="12">Call 'd me neighbour , and friend , brother soldier , and all that ,</l>
     <l n="13">Introducing the Major with plenty of small chat ;</l>
     <l n="14">In short we became all so happy together ,</l>
     <l n="15">They thought it was best I should just remove hither ;</l>
     <l n="16">In fact as High Harrogate 's now all the go ,</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Twould be folly to stay any longer at Low .</l>
     <l n="18">The Col'nel and Lady reside at the Granby ,</l>
     <l n="19">But the Major and I who are good friends as can be ,</l>
     <l n="20">Prefer at the Dragon to take up our quarters ;</l>
     <l n="21">Where the company 's charming , tho ’ some of ‘ em Tartars ,</l>
     <l n="22">And the eating 's so good and the claret so fine ,</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Tis worth riding post fifty miles just to dine ,</l>
     <l n="24">And in spite of the bustle ( good madam do n't frown ,)</l>
     <l n="25">The house and the garden 's as neat as your own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="26">Here 's a young widow Jointurewell lately come dashing ,</l>
     <l n="27">But the Countess of Allwit 's the woman for splashing ,</l>
     <l n="28">Her bays in their coach are as constantly prancing ,</l>
     <l n="29">As the widow 's black eyes on the strangers are glancing .</l>
     <l n="30">The fam 'd —— r —— n —— he is this moment arriving ,</l>
     <l n="31">To strangers well known by the style of his driving</l>
     <l n="32">For he sports his own mail his own trumpet he blows ,</l>
     <l n="33">So he well may be known wheresoever he goes ,</l>
     <l n="34">He 's the soul of good humour , of frolic , and whim ,</l>
     <l n="35">And High Harrogate owes half its pleasures to him .</l>
     <l n="36">Lady Shufflecut 's here and her husband Sir Ned ,</l>
     <l n="37">She games all the night while he 's snoring in bed ,</l>
     <l n="38">And tho ’ handsome and young he 's so idle all day ,</l>
     <l n="39">That he seldom assists in her labours at play ;</l>
     <l n="40">So the lady transacts all the business alone ,</l>
     <l n="41">Tho ’ he on her efforts subsists ‘ tis well known ,</l>
     <l n="42">Her friend Lady Sweepstakes oft comes for a rubber ,</l>
     <l n="43">And gen'rally finds some one willing to drub her ,</l>
     <l n="44">But tied by her Lord to play only for guineas ,</l>
     <l n="45">She bites while she 's bit and then laughs at the ninnies ;</l>
     <l n="46">Who in losing their time have egregiously blundered ,</l>
     <l n="47">In but taking ten pounds where they hoped for a hundred ;</l>
     <l n="48">For wit and good humour this lady can boast ,</l>
     <l n="49">And her temper can keep when her money is lost .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="50">We 've a dashing buck Parson among us a creature ,</l>
     <l n="51">I can never describe since ‘ tis quite out of nature ,</l>
     <l n="52">Tho ’ the race is antique for I 'm sure ‘ tis the same ,</l>
     <l n="53">That St. Paul has declar 'd can take “ glory in shame , ”</l>
     <l n="54">For he 's constantly gaming or quizzing the church ,</l>
     <l n="55">Where he holds two good livings but leaves in the lurch ,</l>
     <l n="56">Tho ’ the “ fusty old bishop ” has sought to restore him ,</l>

     <l n="58">In other bad men I am sorry to say ,</l>
     <l n="59">We wink at the sin when the humour is gay ,</l>

     <l n="61">Their errors o'erlook for their temper or parts ;</l>
     <l n="62">But he who embracing an holy profession ,</l>
     <l n="63">Thus robs some good man of a needful possession ;</l>
     <l n="64">While conscious his heart is abandon 'd and vicious ,</l>
     <l n="65">Is disgustingly wicked , thence seldom pernicious ;</l>
     <l n="66">So a beacon of warning this coxcomb supplies ,</l>
     <l n="67">Since few men will follow what all men despise ;</l>
     <l n="68">And bad as the world is he stands by himself ,</l>
     <l n="69">We have good ones enow to lay him on the shelf ;</l>
     <l n="70">Who e'en in this place of profuse dissipation ,</l>
     <l n="71">Still honour themselves , and adorn their vocation .</l>

     <l n="74">His humour is droll and his tongue like a sickle ,</l>

     <l n="76">Lady Shufflecut oft from his spleen gets a hit ,</l>
     <l n="77">But she pockets his money which pays for his wit ,</l>
     <l n="78">As beauties the —— nds are at present the rage ,</l>
     <l n="79">And one has two strings to her bow I 'll engage ,</l>
     <l n="80">But I 'm sorry to say that the elegant Julie ,</l>
     <l n="81">Has the fault of the day and forgets to love truly ,</l>
     <l n="82">For a fine showy rake whose pretension to merit ,</l>
     <l n="83">Is a far distant title he ne'er may inherit ,</l>
     <l n="84">She forsakes a most excellent well manner 'd youth ,</l>
     <l n="85">Who deserves her no less for his virtue than truth .</l>
     <l n="86">How soon will she learn from her new master 's teaching ,</l>
     <l n="87">“ She has cast off a pearl ” , but I 've no time for preaching ;</l>
     <l n="88">So I only shall mention one family more ,</l>
     <l n="89">Tho ’ I wish to describe you at least half-a-score ;</l>
     <l n="90">‘ Tis an old fashion 'd gentleman drest like a show ,</l>

     <l n="93">Tho ’ still a fine woman complies with the whim ,</l>
     <l n="94">But his daughter an elegant lovely young creature ,</l>
     <l n="95">Steals a spice of the mode in her dress tho ’ not nature ,</l>
     <l n="96">For a being so lively , yet modest , and charming ,</l>
     <l n="97">So simple so wild to the heart so alarming , 630</l>
     <l n="98">This world or its customs e'er form 'd I believe ,</l>
     <l n="99">From the very first days of our grandmother Eve .</l>

     <l n="100">From a Cumberland castle I find they have crept ,</l>
     <l n="101">Where from ages to ages their ancestors slept ;</l>
     <l n="102">And ‘ tis vastly amusing to see how they look ,</l>
     <l n="103">On the Harrogate world , as a new open 'd book ,</l>
     <l n="104">Where many new faces appear to delight ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="105">But many new manners to wound and affright ‘ em</l>
     <l n="106">The old man is shock 'd to find gamesters in orders ,</l>
     <l n="107">And barons whose names are well known on the Borders ,</l>
     <l n="108">Now the rivals of grooms a degen'rate race ,</l>
     <l n="109">The days and the deeds of their grandsires disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="110">Nor less does he mourn o'er the ladies undrest ,</l>
     <l n="111">While his delicate daughter , tho ’ silent 's distrest ;</l>
     <l n="112">But his lady bewails with an innocent sigh ,</l>
     <l n="113">That women should gamble , should flirt , or look sly ,</l>
     <l n="114">And declares when they wish to do any thing odd ,</l>
     <l n="115">They should ask their liege lords for a smile and a nod ,</l>
     <l n="116">A practice she thinks in a great many cases ,</l>
     <l n="117">Would save much confusion ‘ mongst knaves , queens , and aces ;</l>
     <l n="118">So contracted her conscience , illiberal her notion ,</l>
     <l n="119">She fancies submission allied to devotion ,</l>
     <l n="120">And thinks ( as she promis 'd it once ) that a wife ,</l>
     <l n="121">Should remember her vow all the days of her life ,</l>
     <l n="122">The Dragonite ladies all laugh loud enough ,</l>
     <l n="123">At her doctrine , her caps , and her long ruffled cuff ,</l>
     <l n="124">Declaring her creed like her dress is replete ,</l>
     <l n="125">With all that is outre , antique , obsolete ,</l>
     <l n="126">‘ Tis the very worst part , of the very old school ,</l>
     <l n="127">Detested by instinct —— exploded by rule ——</l>
     <l n="128">Lady Shufflecut vows she 'll to Coventry send her ,</l>
     <l n="129">And the Countess declares not a soul shall defend her ,</l>
     <l n="130">Mrs. Rantipole wishes all women so silly ,</l>
     <l n="131">Were tied by the neck to the heels of her filly ,</l>
     <l n="132">But somehow I feel in the midst of this pother ,</l>
     <l n="133">I should much like a wife who had had such a mother ,</l>
     <l n="134">With this hint dearest madam I 'll bid you good bye ,</l>

     <l n="2">You 'll rejoice my kind mother to hear once again ,</l>
     <l n="3">I 've been shooting with pleasure and health in my train ,</l>
     <l n="4">The Major and I went a sporting together ,</l>
     <l n="5">Traversing whole regions of sweet mountain heather ,</l>
     <l n="6">And brought back such a number of very fine grouse</l>
     <l n="7">They charm 'd all the ladies and pleas 'd all the house ,</l>
     <l n="8">But unluckily just in the bar while I stopp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="9">To present Mrs. Goodlad the fruits I had cropp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">A fine powder 'd Cockney just took up my gun ,</l>
     <l n="11">Crying “ shooting dear sar must be wery good fun ,</l>

     <l n="13">When off went the piece like the snuff of a candle ,</l>
     <l n="14">My unfortunate fingers at once caught the powder ,</l>
     <l n="15">While the poor little Londonite felt at his shou'der</l>
     <l n="16">I could'nt help laughing in spite of my smart ,</l>
     <l n="17">To see how he trembled and shook to the heart ,</l>

     <l n="29">And a very fine supper to finish it all ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where elegance , plenty , and order presided ,</l>
     <l n="31">A trio that ought to be never divided . 698</l>

     <l n="43">The thefts of old time she contrives to repair ,</l>

     <l n="56">And should the poor wretches presume but to grumble ,</l>
     <l n="57">Look down with contempt and so bid them be humble ,</l>
     <l n="58">But though on our entrance we flounder and flout ,</l>
     <l n="59">Be assur 'd we are better before we go out ,</l>

     <l n="65">Some thunder I heard and the sky ‘ gan to frown ;</l>
     <l n="66">So expecting a shower my way I soon bent ,</l>
     <l n="67">To a mean looking cottage to ‘ scape the descent ;</l>
     <l n="68">And o'ertook the poor owner decrepid and sickly ,</l>
     <l n="69">Who strove but in vain , to move forward more quickly ;</l>
     <l n="70">So I said “ honest fellow your toiling refrain ,</l>
     <l n="71">You may yet reach your cottage untouch 'd by the rain . ”</l>
     <l n="72">When struck by my voice he turn 'd round to reply ,</l>
     <l n="73">I saw with much pain the tears stand in his eye ,</l>
     <l n="74">“ I have two little girls Sir , should tempest come on ,</l>
     <l n="75">“ Most sorely they 'll grieve that their daddy is gone ;</l>
     <l n="76">“ But their mother will sooth them , ” “ their mother , ” ! he cried ,</l>
     <l n="77">And his anguish gush 'd forth in keen agony 's tide . 743</l>
     <l n="78">Alarm 'd and distress 'd by the wound I had given ,</l>
     <l n="79">I dismounted and leaving my pony with Stephen ,</l>
     <l n="80">Attended the mourner whose words weak and faint</l>
     <l n="81">Were rather the language of woe than complaint ,</l>
     <l n="82">Tho ’ worn with disease and by mis'ry opprest ,</l>
     <l n="83">Yet one sorrow ‘ bove all gave a pang to his breast ,</l>
     <l n="84">The heart that was widow 'd all evils could bear ,</l>
     <l n="85">For sorrow is sunk in the gulph of despair !</l>
     <l n="86">“ Many men have good wives Sir but one like my own ,</l>
     <l n="87">I doubt even great men too seldom have known ,</l>
     <l n="88">“ When robb 'd by disease of our means of subsistence ,</l>
     <l n="89">“ Her care and industry kept want at a distance ;</l>
     <l n="90">“ Her tenderness sooth 'd while her labour sustain 'd me ,</l>
     <l n="91">“ Nor a word pass 'd her lips Sir , that ever yet pain 'd me ,</l>
     <l n="92">“ To her all my burden of suffering was given ,</l>
     <l n="93">“ And it sunk her to earth while it rais 'd her to Heaven , ”</l>
     <l n="94">‘ Twas simplicity 's tale which no words could adorn ,</l>
     <l n="95">And I wept o'er the being thus ‘ reft and forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="96">Ere I ventur 'd to offer that kind of relief ,</l>
     <l n="97">Which could sooth but one source of his manifold grief .</l>
     <l n="98">It was sympathy 's proof and I wish for no other ,</l>
     <l n="99">That however divided still man is man 's brother ;</l>
     <l n="100">But judge my emotion on ent'ring the cot ,</l>
     <l n="101">Where once love and innocence hallow 'd the spot ,</l>
     <l n="102">To see love and innocence burst on my sight ,</l>
     <l n="103">In a form more endearing and beauty more bright ,</l>
     <l n="104">‘ Twas my Cumberland maiden embracing each child</l>
     <l n="105">Like the Angel of pity that wept as she smil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="106">She had heard the poor babes as they wander 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="107">Lament their dear mammy laid deep in the ground ,</l>
     <l n="108">And stole from her party tho ’ splendid and gay ,</l>
     <l n="109">To wipe their sad tears and to show them their way ,</l>
     <l n="110">Now I gaz 'd !— my heart throbb 'd ! while a kind of devotion</l>
     <l n="111">Rose at once to my tongue and obstructed its motion ,</l>
     <l n="112">May I ne'er lose the sense of that sacred sensation</l>
     <l n="113">Or forget her blue eyes more divine emanation !</l>
     <l n="114">In folly 's light moment in solitude 's hour ,</l>
     <l n="115">Still dear be its memory , resistless its pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="116">And if ever false pleasure to guilt should allure me ,</l>
     <l n="117">May a glance on this scene from perdition secure me .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="118">Whatever each thought was reveal 'd but in looks ,</l>
     <l n="119">And I trust that for once they were legible books ,</l>
     <l n="120">Which fairly translated read this way I deem ,</l>
     <l n="121">Our compassion is mutual , be such our esteem ,</l>
     <l n="122">We walk 'd home together a road long and dreary ,</l>
     <l n="123">But my heart trod in air , nor did Agnes seem weary ,</l>
     <l n="124">And her mother declares she 'll go with us to-morrow</l>
     <l n="125">To visit and comfort these children of sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="126">And tho ’ with the Major engaged to my cost ,</l>
     <l n="127">To take my revenge for some trifles I 've lost ;</l>
     <l n="128">And sweet Lady Shufflecut vow 'd I should take ,</l>
     <l n="129">A hand at her table , yet all I 'll forsake ,</l>
     <l n="130">For one gentle smile from that excellent being ,</l>
     <l n="131">Of all this world 's pleasures is best worth the seeing ,</l>
     <l n="132">And would she but smile in the way that I want her ,</l>
     <l n="133">The wealth of the Indies for that smile I 'd banter ;</l>
     <l n="134">But adieu , my dear mother , I cannot dissemble ,</l>
     <l n="135">That my hopes , and my fears , put me all in a tremble .</l>

     <l n="1">High Harrogate , August 26th .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">This week in such various amusement has past ,</l>
     <l n="3">I have scarce had an hour to myself since my last ,</l>
     <l n="4">On Monday all day we for wagers were prancing ,</l>
     <l n="5">And concluded at night with most exquisite dancing ;</l>
     <l n="6">Our belles and our ball every other excell 'd ,</l>
     <l n="7">And our supper the finest you ever beheld ;</l>
     <l n="8">With Agnes I danc 'd and with Agnes I sat , 801</l>
     <l n="9">And enjoy 'd much communion tho ’ but little chat .</l>
     <l n="10">On Tuesday we all sally 'd out on the green ,</l>
     <l n="11">To see Mr. —— drive his dashing machine ,</l>
     <l n="12">In a figure of eight , but alas he was cross 'd ,</l>
     <l n="13">And his coach and four bays were to — n — s — n lost !</l>
     <l n="14">For his horses tho ’ doubtlessly brutes of great sense ,</l>
     <l n="15">Were unskill 'd in the shaping or saving of pence ;</l>
     <l n="16">But he quickly redeem 'd them and mounting again ,</l>
     <l n="17">Return 'd our brisk cheers as he drove o'er the plain .</l>
     <l n="18">The next day we were treated with excellent races ,</l>
     <l n="19">But alas when they clos 'd there were many long faces ;</l>
     <l n="20">And especially poor Lady Shufflecut 's prov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="21">She had dabbled too much in the current she lov 'd ;</l>
     <l n="22">So profusely her bets had been offer 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="23">That her wings were close clipp 'd ere she drove from the ground ;</l>
     <l n="24">When eagerly seeking her loss to repair ,</l>
     <l n="25">She doubled the mischief that fell to her share ;</l>
     <l n="26">And in words cabalistic combin 'd with “ done , done , ”</l>
     <l n="27">The evening completed what morning begun ,</l>
     <l n="28">And tho ’ till broad day-light she push 'd on her chance ,</l>
     <l n="29">Yet fortune ne'er deign 'd an encouraging glance ,</l>
     <l n="30">For Major O'Baffin and Twig'em together ,</l>
     <l n="31">Pluck 'd her poor little Ladyship down to a feather .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="32">What pity a female whom nature assign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="33">Such a portion of beauty in person and mind ,</l>
     <l n="34">Whose softness and wit might have temper 'd thro ’ life ,</l>
     <l n="35">The sweetest ingredients we seek in a wife ,</l>
     <l n="36">Should absorb 'd in one crime make a hell of that breast ,</l>
     <l n="37">Where dove-like benignity once form 'd her nest ,</l>
     <l n="38">For sure if all storms were together combin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="39">Of hail , rain , and tempest , steel , thunder , and wind ,</l>
     <l n="40">The light'ning ' s red glare , and the volcano laming ,</l>
     <l n="41">Will but shadow the passions of woman when gaming ,</l>
     <l n="42">Unmask 'd , and unsex 'd she presents to our view ,</l>
     <l n="43">The image of vice in her own native hue ,</l>
     <l n="44">At the fury before us in horror we gaze ,</l>
     <l n="45">And ask where the woman is fled in amaze ?</l>
     <l n="46">Whence sprung this dread Demon ye sages tell ,</l>
     <l n="47">Was she born upon earth , or transported from hell ,</l>
     <l n="48">What plagues and what pestilence met in their rambling ,</l>
     <l n="49">To form this detestable passion for gambling ,</l>
     <l n="50">Society 's Upas that withers the ground ,</l>
     <l n="51">And poisons the blossoms of virtue around ,</l>
     <l n="52">Destroying and blasting all promise of worth ,</l>
     <l n="53">Like the curse of the locusts “ that ravaged the earth . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="54">When Avarice with Misery alone in his cot ,</l>
     <l n="55">Had endur 'd many years an old bachelor 's lot ,</l>
     <l n="56">He sought from this partner to make a division ,</l>
     <l n="57">By seeking himself , for a change of condition ,</l>
     <l n="58">Concluding like many old men , that a wife ,</l>
     <l n="59">Would banish grim Misery his cottage for life ,</l>
     <l n="60">And the better this end so desir 'd to obtain ,</l>
     <l n="61">He fix 'd on a damsel , young , splendid , and vain ,</l>
     <l n="62">Her name Prodigality — not over nice ,</l>
     <l n="63">The lady lov 'd Avarice alone for his vice ,</l>
     <l n="64">And reckon 'd the pleasure of emptying his coffer ,</l>
     <l n="65">Would atone for all other defects in the offer ,</l>
     <l n="66">They marry and fly at the lady 's suggestion ,</l>
     <l n="67">A very long way from the cot of discretion , 860</l>
     <l n="68">For Extravagance sold them a villa and park ,</l>
     <l n="69">Which was stock 'd by Expence with all wares like an ark ,</l>
     <l n="70">Yet the bridegroom astonish 'd beheld with great pain ,</l>
     <l n="71">That Mis'ry was still the first man in their train ,</l>
     <l n="72">He stalk 'd o'er their garden — sat down at their table ,</l>
     <l n="73">He perch 'd on the coach , and he groan 'd in the stable ;</l>
     <l n="74">And the tongue of the lady tho ’ flippant and strong ,</l>
     <l n="75">Could not keep his keen face from her dressing-room long ,</l>
     <l n="76">Nay e'en when her first blooming daughter was born ,</l>
     <l n="77">Old Misery stood sponsor in spite of her scorn ,</l>
     <l n="78">And while she his rude interference was blaming ,</l>
     <l n="79">With mighty sang froid he pronounc 'd the babe “ Gaming . ”</l>
     <l n="80">Prodigality sought for a nurse at her leisure ,</l>
     <l n="81">And consign 'd the fair imp to be dandled by pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="82">Hence some have mistaken this child for another ,</l>
     <l n="83">Amusement — no kin , but a mere foster brother .</l>
     <l n="84">As the young one grew up she full early display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="85">Her sire 's inclination for scraping in trade ,</l>
     <l n="86">Was wond'rous alert at a close calculation ,</l>
     <l n="87">And scann 'd the whole science of deep computation ,</l>
     <l n="88">When embu 'd with her father 's all grasping desires ,</l>
     <l n="89">The rashness of daring her mother inspires ,</l>
     <l n="90">And bids her ne'er hesitate roundly to send ,</l>
     <l n="91">A bold speculation in search of her end , 884</l>
     <l n="92">Thus covetous meanness combines with profusion ,</l>
     <l n="93">To spread o'er her actions the veil of delusion ;</l>
     <l n="94">While Misery attends her wherever she goes ,</l>
     <l n="95">With hosts of bad passions , and myriads of woes ,</l>
     <l n="96">The foremost I ween is that canker-worm Care ,</l>
     <l n="97">And the last that black fiend which proceeds from despair ,</l>
     <l n="98">Life knows not one torment that gnaws like the first ,</l>
     <l n="99">And the last of all deaths , is the death most accurst .</l>
     <l n="100">I hope you 'll excuse this long fabling digression ,</l>
     <l n="101">As a thing very common in bards by profession ,</l>
     <l n="102">And to tell you the truth having been somewhat bit ,</l>
     <l n="103">I find I have gain 'd a new edge to my wit ,</l>
     <l n="104">Yes ! thanks to O'Baffin , his friendship 's unriddled ,</l>
     <l n="105">And her Ladyship 's simper , with “ Blunderhead 's diddled . ”</l>
     <l n="106">But ‘ tis well I 'm no worse and the wisdom they taught me ,</l>
     <l n="107">Experience alone I 'm afraid could have bought me ,</l>
     <l n="108">For I foolishly slighted Sir J — n G — ff — d 's hint ,</l>
     <l n="109">Tho ’ I knew his heart sterling as gold from the mint ;</l>
     <l n="110">I wish my good Col'nel aware of this Major ,</l>
     <l n="111">Would take home his wife in the country to cage her ,</l>
     <l n="112">For this Cormorant 's eyes while they glanc 'd on my purse ,</l>
     <l n="113">Mark 'd the Col'nel I doubt for a robb'ry far worse ,</l>
     <l n="114">Ah mother ! dear mother ! I now can perceive it ,</l>
     <l n="115">The world is far worse than I once could believe it ,</l>
     <l n="116">When we mountaineers from the Peak make these sallies ,</l>
     <l n="117">We meet with strange cattle in civiliz 'd vallies ,</l>
     <l n="118">And our good education I honestly own ,</l>
     <l n="119">But fits us to mix with each other alone ,</l>
     <l n="120">Our naivete , simplicity , openness , truth ,</l>
     <l n="121">The romantic attachments of warm-hearted youth ,</l>
     <l n="122">In the world 's chilling atmosphere meet with such shocks ,</l>
     <l n="123">We had better ne'er roam from our own native rocks ,</l>
     <l n="124">But at present away with these moral excursions ,</l>
     <l n="125">And return we again to the list of diversions . 916</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="126">Next came donkey races and pony likewise ,</l>
     <l n="127">Each nobly contending a suitable prize ,</l>
     <l n="128">For the last a fine saddle was stuck up to view ,</l>
     <l n="129">Which after hard riding was won by the blue ,</l>
     <l n="130">Then we all were amus 'd by men jumping in sacks ,</l>
     <l n="131">Tho ’ it laid the competitors soon on their backs ,</l>
     <l n="132">But the best sport of all since it shew 'd the most skill ,</l>
     <l n="133">Was two well lather 'd pigs left to run at their will</l>
     <l n="134">Which who seiz 'd by the tail was to have for the catching ,</l>
     <l n="135">But the grunters in this had the best in the matching ,</l>
     <l n="136">And I never yet saw such most excellent fun ,</l>
     <l n="137">As they made of the fellows who ventur 'd to run ;</l>
     <l n="138">Nor do I yet think that they fairly were caught ,</l>
     <l n="139">But the company all left the place ere they ought ,</l>
     <l n="140">For a very fine turtle that day was set out ,</l>
     <l n="141">By a West India heiress presented sans doute ,</l>
     <l n="142">And people of taste were impatient to try ,</l>
     <l n="143">If Harrogate turtle with London could vie ;</l>
     <l n="144">And ‘ tis with great pride my good madam I tell ,</l>
     <l n="145">‘ Twas allow 'd that our cook did all London excel ,</l>
     <l n="146">I 'm sure that Lord Gout , and Sir Harry Fullfare ,</l>
     <l n="147">Each ate three good pints of the soup for their share ,</l>
     <l n="148">And Mrs. Gourmander with Lady Allferret ,</l>
     <l n="149">Were equally strong in their proofs of its merit ,</l>
     <l n="150">And as very good eating some men of deep thinking ,</l>
     <l n="151">Have roundly declar 'd calls for very good drinking ;</l>
     <l n="152">This alliance so nat'ral we sought to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="153">And gave to the turtle the honour its due ,</l>
     <l n="154">And that night for the first time I stagger 'd to bed ,</l>
     <l n="155">With more wine on my stomach , than sense in my head ,</l>
     <l n="156">But a dose of the water as soon as ‘ twas day ,</l>
     <l n="157">Dispers 'd all my head-ache and left me quite gay ,</l>
     <l n="158">And ‘ twas well that this good panacea I took ,</l>
     <l n="159">Or Agnes had murder 'd my hopes with a look ;</l>
     <l n="160">For at best they 're so delicate poor little things ,</l>
     <l n="161">One glance of her anger would clip all their wings ,</l>
     <l n="162">But I nourish the nestlings as well as I 'm able ,</l>
     <l n="163">And consider each smile as an anchor and cable ,</l>
     <l n="164">My courage sometimes rises up to my cheek ,</l>
     <l n="165">Where it flushes and glows yet forbids me to speak ;</l>
     <l n="166">I would give all the world to make love to one woman ,</l>
     <l n="167">With the ease Col'nel B — tem — n can do it in common ,</l>
     <l n="168">So pointed , yet meek , sentimental , and charming ,</l>
     <l n="169">Tho ’ always encroaching yet never alarming ; 960</l>
     <l n="170">But no wonder the Colonel shines in this way ,</l>
     <l n="171">For practice makes perfect in all things they say ,</l>
     <l n="172">And to maid , wife , or widow he 's constantly paying ,</l>
     <l n="173">Those tender attentions most dear , most betraying ,</l>
     <l n="174">Unmindful I ween what vexations and smarts ,</l>
     <l n="175">Must follow the game in this “ play upon hearts . ”</l>
     <l n="176">Far different the bosom true passion inspires ,</l>
     <l n="177">That silently loves , and devoutly admires ,</l>
     <l n="178">It sighs not by rule nor makes speeches by measure ,</l>
     <l n="179">Nor studies the arts of allurement at leisure ,</l>
     <l n="180">Yet feeling all eloquent sometimes reveals ,</l>
     <l n="181">That state of the soul which timidity seals ,</l>
     <l n="182">And I take it the very best chance for a lover ,</l>
     <l n="183">Is that moment when fortune his flame may discover ;</l>
     <l n="184">Since no damsel will shrink from a peep at the breast ,</l>
     <l n="185">Where her own lovely form is so sweetly imprest ,</l>
     <l n="186">For should she regret that the picture 's ill plac 'd ,</l>
     <l n="187">Yet she 'll value the wearer for exquisite taste .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="188">My Agnes of late has convers 'd more than common ,</l>
     <l n="189">With a Mrs. Latouche a most excellent woman ,</l>
     <l n="190">Whose husband like many brave fellows beside ,</l>
     <l n="191">By his country was torn from the arms of his bride ,</l>
     <l n="192">For three years has he left her his absence to mourn ,</l>
     <l n="193">But she now has some hopes of his speedy return ,</l>
     <l n="194">She visits this place with a poor ailing aunt ,</l>
     <l n="195">Whom she tends with that kindness all invalids want ,</l>
     <l n="196">And proves in her tenderness , faithfulness , duty ,</l>
     <l n="197">Her virtue at least is as great as her beauty ,</l>
     <l n="198">Twin soul with my charmer I think it no wonder ,</l>
     <l n="199">( Tho ’ I 'm sorry sometimes ) they are seldom asunder ,</l>
     <l n="200">I fancy whenever I see them conversing ,</l>
     <l n="201">The wife all the worth of her lord is rehearsing ,</l>
     <l n="202">But I dare not yet hope that my Agnes replies ,</l>

    <head>LETTER IX .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">High Harrogate , August 30th .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Dear mother I 've so much to say in my letter ,</l>
     <l n="3">Tho ’ the last was too long I fear this wo'nt be better ,</l>
     <l n="4">And someway I never know how to begin ,</l>
     <l n="5">When I 've got a great many fine things to bring in ;</l>
     <l n="6">Nor can I with truth to our mutual relief ,</l>
     <l n="7">Declare in the first place I mean to be brief ,</l>
     <l n="8">For I know to my sorrow no Blunderhead yet ,</l>
     <l n="9">Could ever the talent of brevity get ,</l>
     <l n="10">So I still must go on with my doggerel chatter ,</l>
     <l n="11">And your pardon implore for “ extraneous matter . ”</l>
     <l n="12">You must know all this summer ‘ t has been much the rage ,</l>
     <l n="13">For High Harrogate parties new scenes to engage ,</l>
     <l n="14">Leaving Studley and Hackfall and huge Brimham rocks ,</l>
     <l n="15">And assemble like swallows in emigrant flocks ,</l>
     <l n="16">Unmindful what terrible roads they must jolt on ,</l>
     <l n="17">To view the fine grounds and the ruins of Bolton ,</l>
     <l n="18">And yesterday morn a large party set out ,</l>
     <l n="19">To partake the delights of this picturesque rout .</l>
     <l n="20">Fair Fenton , sweet Agnes , and lovely Latouche ,</l>
     <l n="21">Were all drove by Sir George in his splendid barouche ,</l>
     <l n="22">And if ever I envy 'd a man so before ,</l>
     <l n="23">I will leave you to judge — but I now say no more .</l>
     <l n="24">The rest in a chariot , and curricles went ,</l>
     <l n="25">And set off pretty early by general consent ,</l>
     <l n="26">At the Blubber-house Inn we all gladly alighted ,</l>
     <l n="27">By the sight of an excellent breakfast invited ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which enabled us all to endure future jumbling ,</l>
     <l n="29">And substitute laughter for hunger , and grumbling ,</l>
     <l n="30">When arrived at the bridge the first glimpse of the scene ,</l>
     <l n="31">Majestic yet simple , tho ’ grand yet serene ,</l>
     <l n="32">Gave presentiment sweet of the pleasure before us ,</l>
     <l n="33">And our hearts with the music of nature kept chorus ,</l>
     <l n="34">We just stopp 'd at the Inn to enquire for a guide ,</l>
     <l n="35">And while saunt'ring around till this want was supplied ,</l>
     <l n="36">A Skipton chaise pass 'd ; whence a stranger look 'd out ,</l>
     <l n="37">To see what so many gay folks were about ;</l>
     <l n="38">But the moment the form of his visage appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="39">What a shriek of delight from his consort was heard ,</l>
     <l n="40">‘ Tis he ! ‘ tis my Henry ! no more could she say ,</l>
     <l n="41">On the bosom of Agnes just fainting she lay ,</l>
     <l n="42">While the gallant Latouche from his vehicle sprung ,</l>
     <l n="43">And in speechless delight o'er his Ellinor hung ;</l>
     <l n="44">While adown his brown face roll 'd the gracefullest tear ,</l>
     <l n="45">Which the hero could shed or the lover hold dear ,</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Twas a moment of bliss so intense in delight ,</l>
     <l n="47">It concenter 'd whole ages of joy in its flight ,</l>
     <l n="48">And as Ellinor 's eyes in transported amaze ,</l>
     <l n="49">Again , and again , on her Henry would gaze ,</l>
     <l n="50">The Elysium of extacy glow 'd in their beam ,</l>
     <l n="51">The world was forgot , and past sorrow a dream .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="52">And think ye that Agnes unmov 'd could behold ,</l>
     <l n="53">A scene where the bosom 's best feeling 's were told ?</l>
     <l n="54">Ah no ! in her cheeks heightened blushes I read ,</l>
     <l n="55">Sensibility 's whisper that moment had sped , 1050</l>
     <l n="56">And told her when hearts thus congenial could meet ,</l>
     <l n="57">Earth knows no communion more pure or more sweet ,</l>
     <l n="58">I hail 'd the blest omen , and watch 'd for the hour ,</l>
     <l n="59">Which should lead our wild wanderings to solitude 's bow'r ,</l>
     <l n="60">But long had we travers 'd the ruins and grove ,</l>
     <l n="61">Ere my lips dar 'd to utter one word of my love</l>
     <l n="62">For such trembling anxiety hung on my breast ,</l>
     <l n="63">Even now I scarce know what I falt'ring confest ,</l>
     <l n="64">But this I well know that my falt'ring confession ,</l>
     <l n="65">Was deem 'd by the fair one no flagrant transgression ,</l>
     <l n="66">Tho ’ her words were but few yet her charming confusion ,</l>
     <l n="67">Assur 'd me forgiveness beyond all delusion ,</l>
     <l n="68">And this young bud of hope ere the sun was gone down ,</l>
     <l n="69">By her kindness became a fair blossom full blown</l>
     <l n="70">Oh morning of rapture ! oh day of delight !</l>
     <l n="71">Oh evening full gemm 'd with the spangles of night !</l>
     <l n="72">If e'er I forget the dear moments ye gave me ,</l>
     <l n="73">May the world be my guide — may her follies enslave me ,</l>
     <l n="74">May the blossom of hope from my bosom dissever ,</l>
     <l n="75">And may Agnes be lost to my wishes for ever ——</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="76">Do you ask me of Bolton its rocks , woods , and plains ,</l>
     <l n="77">Where beauty enthron 'd in sublimity reigns ?</l>
     <l n="78">Where the Wharfe ever lovely , capricious , romantic ,</l>
     <l n="79">Or murmuring glides or impetuously frantic ,</l>
     <l n="80">Now spreads o'er the plain in majestic repose ,</l>
     <l n="81">Now rending the rocks as a cataract flows ?</l>
     <l n="82">Or enquire of the Priory whose ruins sublime ,</l>
     <l n="83">Shew beauties more soft from the pressure of time ,</l>
     <l n="84">And as their fine forms moulder gently away ,</l>
     <l n="85">Awake veneration and love from decay ?</l>
     <l n="86">Of Bardon 's fine tow'r which proudly excelling ,</l>
     <l n="87">The Genius of Craven might choose for his dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="88">( For Genii and Fairies alone should be found ,</l>
     <l n="89">To people the regions celestial around , 1084</l>
     <l n="90">While a Demon of darkness might howl o'er the Strid ,</l>
     <l n="91">And lash the fierce torrent that roar 'd as he chid ,)</l>
     <l n="92">Yes this is the region for fancy to soar ,</l>
     <l n="93">Meditation to rove and devotion adore ,</l>
     <l n="94">For the painter 's whole soul to exist in his eye ,</l>
     <l n="95">And the poet 's on pinions new plumag 'd to fly !</l>
     <l n="96">But alas tho ’ each charm I could quickly discover ,</l>
     <l n="97">Yet expect no description but one from a lover ,</l>
     <l n="98">If to tell of the Abbey 's grey stones I begin ,</l>
     <l n="99">I shall surely contrast them with Agnes 's skin ;</l>
     <l n="100">From the rock herbage-crown 'd all bespangled with dew ,</l>
     <l n="101">I shall start to her eye 's melting orbit of blue ;</l>
     <l n="102">Nor a wave of the river can flow wildly simple ,</l>
     <l n="103">But Agnes will rise with her smile and her dimple ,</l>
     <l n="104">So aware of my weakness I make no pretension ,</l>
     <l n="105">To give you description supply 'd by invention ,</l>
     <l n="106">But I 've bought a whole set of fine prints which will prove ,</l>
     <l n="107">That Bolton is meet for the birth place of love .</l>
     <l n="108">And in them I will shew you dear mother , those places ,</l>
     <l n="109">The smiles of my fair one illum 'd with new graces ,</l>
     <l n="110">And when I 'm so blest ( may the time quickly come ,)</l>
     <l n="111">To bring the sweet maid to a Derbyshire home ,</l>
     <l n="112">These pictures hung round the old hall shall display ,</l>
     <l n="113">How dear to my heart are the scenes they pourtray ,</l>
     <l n="114">And Agnes methinks “ nothing loth ” will behold ,</l>
     <l n="115">The spot where my passion first dar 'd to unfold ,</l>
     <l n="116">And fondly will point to that bank where the willow ,</l>
     <l n="117">Re-murmur 'd my vows as it bent to the billow .—</l>
     <l n="118">“ Dear Bolton adieu ! ” we all cried while returning ,</l>
     <l n="119">“ Whoe'er left thy glen 's lovely vale without mourning . ”</l>
     <l n="120">When just as we spoke the fair rectory rose ,</l>
     <l n="121">Like the dwelling of peace in the lap of repose ,</l>
     <l n="122">We started with pleasure astonish 'd to find ,</l>
     <l n="123">Such a Paradise close on the Eden behind ,</l>
     <l n="124">There Pomona 's rich clusters hung sportively round ,</l>
     <l n="125">And Flora 's gay carpet enamell 'd the ground .</l>
     <l n="126">As enchanted we gaz 'd the kind owner appearing ,</l>
     <l n="127">Address 'd us with manners politely endearing ,</l>
     <l n="128">And much we regretted the shadows of eve ,</l>
     <l n="129">Oblig 'd us reluctantly soon to take leave . 1124</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="130">Dinner quickly dispatch 'd — to the Captain of course ,</l>
     <l n="131">My seat I resign 'd and then borrow 'd a horse ,</l>
     <l n="132">Be assur 'd the barouche was most duly attended ,</l>
     <l n="133">And from dangers ( that came not ) most bravely defended ,</l>
     <l n="134">So courageous I felt , that ‘ twas really a pity ,</l>
     <l n="135">We never encounter 'd one troop of banditti ,</l>
     <l n="136">No fright of the horses induc 'd them to try ,</l>
     <l n="137">Just to leap o'er a bridge tho ’ so many were nigh ,</l>
     <l n="138">As the roads that would shake her ‘ twas folly to fly at ,</l>
     <l n="139">I was forc 'd to ride on most provokingly quiet ,</l>
     <l n="140">In hopes that some future occasion will prove ,</l>
     <l n="141">My prowess , and gallantry , equal my love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="142">This morning I rose with the dawning of day ,</l>
     <l n="143">On Agnes to think and contrive what to say ,</l>
     <l n="144">And after some planning and much hesitation ,</l>
     <l n="145">To her father I spoke on this weighty occasion :</l>
     <l n="146">And I gratefully own that the worthy old Squire ,</l>
     <l n="147">Was as kind to my hopes as my heart could desire ;</l>
     <l n="148">He confess 'd ‘ twas his foible to value old blood ,</l>
     <l n="149">And declar 'd that my race was both ancient and good ,</l>
     <l n="150">‘ Fore the conquest he reckon 'd some fifteen or twenty ,</l>
     <l n="151">And when it took place there were Blunderheads plenty ,</l>
     <l n="152">In the days of King Stephen ‘ tis known how they flourish 'd ,</l>
     <l n="153">And the wars of the Roses the pedigree nourish 'd ,</l>
     <l n="154">In Harry the eighth 's time ‘ twas easy to trace ,</l>
     <l n="155">The parliament owed its support to our race ,</l>
     <l n="156">Tho ’ Elizabeth liked us not yet it was plain ,</l>
     <l n="157">We came pretty handsomely in the next reign ;</l>
     <l n="158">And continued in pow'r thro ’ succeeding confusion ,</l>
     <l n="159">Till sadly eclips 'd by the proud revolution ,</l>
     <l n="160">And altho ’ since that period somewhat declining ,</l>
     <l n="161">He trusted the time would return for our shining ,</l>
     <l n="162">Tho ’ ‘ tis true that the Regent disclaims our alliance ,</l>
     <l n="163">From his fondness for freedom , for arts , and for science .</l>
     <l n="164">In short he appear 'd both so learned and kind ,</l>
     <l n="165">He 's the wisest and best of old men to my mind ,</l>
     <l n="166">But adieu my dear mother I 'm now on the wing ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">For my silence these three weeks your pardon I ask ,</l>
     <l n="3">But really dear mother all writing 's a task ,</l>
     <l n="4">Save for sonnets to Agnes I do not know when ,</l>
     <l n="5">My run-a-way fingers laid hold of a pen ,</l>
     <l n="6">But I trust your indulgence will freely excuse ,</l>

     <l n="25">For a sigh to our parting is gratitude 's debt ,</l>
     <l n="26">His suavity , modesty , knowledge , and truth ,</l>
     <l n="27">Where the wisdom of age , joins the candour of youth ,</l>

    <head>NOTES .</head>
    <p n="1">NOTES .</p>
    <p n="2">Our respects to the beauties of Knaresbro ’ &amp; c. Verse 342 .— Knaresbro ’ is a considerable Town , situated on a rock almost encompassed by the river Nidd . Near the town are the ruins of an ancient magnificent castle built soon after the Conquest , and in one side of a neighbouring rock is a cell where an hermit lived , still called St. Robert 's Chapel . The altar is cut out of one piece of solid rock , and on it are engraved the figures of three heads , supposed to represent the Trinity . This Robert founded himself a new order of monks , called Robertines , but it is probable that they soon diminished to nothing , as we do not meet with their name either in the Breviary or Baronius .</p>
    <p n="3">But the greatest curiosity at Knaresbro ’ is the petrifying spring commonly called the Dropping-Well . This natural curiosity is a spring that rises about two miles from the town , and after running above a mile under ground , comes to the top of a rock sixteen feet high , after which it drops through in fifty or sixty places into a bason below , formed by nature for its reception . Every drop has something of a musical sound as if it were small stones falling on brass , and near it are many pieces of moss reduced to a state of petrefaction ; there is a fine walk on one side of the well shaded with tall trees that makes the whole extremely delightful .</p>
    <p n="4">Extract from British Traveller , page 621 .</p>
    <p n="5">To this brief extract the Editor begs leave to add , that the finest views of this singularly beautiful place are obtained from the Low-bridge , the road leading to the Upper-bridge , and the fields which are nearly opposite the castle ; the variety of cottages and the beautiful knolls of bold and herbaged rock which every where intersect the scenery , render it the most picturesque and interesting which can be found in so short a compass . But though much beauty may be discovered in a few hours at Knaresbrough , yet its charms will not be exhausted by the residence of a long life .</p>
    <p n="6">To Plumpton proceeded , &amp; c. v . 374 .— This beautiful spot is rendered extremely attractive to the visitors at Harrogate , not only on account of its intrinsic merit , but its vicinity , as it is scarcely three miles distant from High Harrogate . Plumpton is always most admired by those who have seen it most frequently , being more pleasing than striking ; it is open to the public on Tuesdays and Fridays ; on the road from Plumpton a fine view of the Honourable Mr. Gordon 's magnificent new mansion in Rudding Park is obtained .</p>
    <p n="7">Editor 's Note .</p>
    <p n="8">To Harewood I went the first day I could , v. 380 . This splendid mansion can be seen only on Saturdays ; it is justly considered an object of admiration as it unites elegance with grandeur , and utility with beauty .</p>
    <p n="9">Editor 's Note .</p>
    <p n="10">To Studley , &amp; c. v . 389 .— The celebrated grounds of Studley have long enjoyed a pre-eminence of fame among the northern beauties ; their characteristics are magnificence , uniformity , and neatness . The stateliness of the trees and the luxuriance of their foliage is unequalled , and combines with the smoothness of the water and the “ clear smooth shaven green , ” which surrounds it , to impress on the mind a sense of repose rather than an emotion of surprise . In its own style , Studley is perfect , and can never fail to delight , though it may be unable to astonish .</p>
    <p n="11">But who hallow 'd Fountains , &amp; c. v . 393 .— The magnificent ruin of Fountains Abbey included in the grounds of Studley , is an object of delight and veneration in the highest degree , and will in the eye of an artist be rendered still more so when it shall have become farther dilapidated ; the first view of it from the grounds of Studley is extremely commanding and striking , but as a ruin it is more beautiful and interesting in the interior views ; the extent of the church and the monastery and its offices conveys a clear idea of the power and state enjoyed by the Benedictine monks , who resided here in all the dignity of honour and the luxury of wealth — the dining-room and kitchen of the higher orders and the refectory of the lower , bespeak the richness of their revenues and their princely method of disposing of them . The trees , shrubs , and foliage intermingled with these extensive ruins , are the principal source of its beauties , being combined and contrasted with the mouldering arches and nodding towers in every possible form ; of these the ivy and wild currant are the most prominent .</p>
    <p n="12">Editor 's Note .</p>
    <p n="13">See the Unicorn send us all merry to Newby , &amp; c. v . 483 .— Newby-hall the seat of Lord Grantham , is most remarkable for possessing a very fine Gallery built after the model of the Florentine Gallery so long the pride of the civilized world ; it contains many fine statues and three sarcophagi , although the largest alone appears to have attracted the attention of Mr. Blunderhead , who it is plain had but little knowledge or taste in works of art .— The tapestry in the drawing-room is considered incomparably fine , but the author has undoubtedly a very handsome and sufficient excuse for leaving it so abruptly .</p>
    <p n="14">Editor 's Note .</p>
    <p n="15">Oh then might I sing lovely Hackfall , v . 453 .— To those who seek in landscape gardening for the wilder features of nature harmonized yet unsubdued by art , this sequestered vale will present an exquisite treat and afford to the contemplative mind a scene of such deep retirement and romantic seclusion adorned with objects of such exquisite and concentred beauty as must meet the eye ere they can be appreciated by the imagination , which may people these fairy regions with every object of terror , or delight with equal propriety .</p>
    <p n="16">Editor 's Note .</p>
    <p n="17">We went to the Minster , v . 505 .— The Minster at Rippon is a fine gothic structure , it formerly contained a narrow passage called the Needle of St. Wilfred , used by the monks as an ordeal for female purity .— The Bone-house contains many thousand skulls , and is generally shewn as a curiosity .</p>
    <p n="18">Editor 's Note .</p>
    <p n="19">Fam 'd Brimham rocks , &amp; c .— v . 1009 .— These prodigious masses of natural rock , together with a druidical temple near them , form one of the objects of curiosity in this neighbourhood ; they are distant about eleven miles .</p>
    <p n="20">Editor 's Note .</p>
    <p n="21">To view the fine grounds and the ruins of Bolton . v . 1011 .— Bolton-Priory stands upon a beautiful curviture of the Wharfe , on a level sufficiently elevated to protect it from inundation , and low enough for every purpose of picturesque effect .— In the latter respect it has no equal among the northern houses , perhaps not in the kingdom .— To the south all is soft and delicious , the eye reposes upon a few rich pastures , a moderate reach of the river sufficiently tranquil to form a mirror for the sun , and the bounding fells beyond neither too near , nor too lofty , to exclude even in winter any considerable portion of his rays .</p>
    <p n="22">But after all , the glories of Bolton are on the north , whatever the most fastidious taste could require to form a perfect landscape , is not only found here , but in its proper place ; in front and immediately under the eye , is a smooth expanse of park-like inclosure , spotted with native elm , ash , &amp; c. of the finest growth ; on the right a skirting oak wood with jutting points of grey rock ; on the left a rising copse , still forward are the aged groves of Bolton-park the growth of centuries , and further yet the barren and rocky distances of Simon Seat and Barden Fell , contrasted with the warmth , fertility , and luxuriant foliage of the valley below — about half a mile above Bolton-Priory the valley closes , and either side of the Wharfe is overhung with deep and solemn woods , intermingled with huge masses of perpendicular rocks which jut out at intervals .</p>
    <p n="23">This sequestered scene was inaccessible till of late , when under the judicious direction of the Rev . W. Carr , B. D. Rector of Bolton-ridings , were cut in the woods , and the most interesting parts laid open to the eye , at the request of the noble proprietor , His Grace the Duke of Devonshire . Extract from Dr. Whitaker 's history of Craven .</p>
    <p n="24">Howl o'er the Strid , &amp; c .— v . 1085 .— In the deep solitude of the woods above Bolton , the Wharfe suddenly contracts itself to a rocky channel little more than four feet wide , and pours through the tremendous fissure with a violence proportioned to its confinement . The place is called the Strid from a feat sometimes exercised by persons of great agility and little prudence , who skip from brink to brink regardless of the destruction which awaits a faltering step . An accident caused by this rashness has given a dreadful and sensible interest to this awful spot , in addition to the commending one it has received by nature , and which is immediately connected with the records of Bolton .</p>
    <p n="25">In the 12th century , William Fitz Duncan at the command of David King of Scotland , who was besieging Narham , laid waste this part of Yorkshire with fire and sword , committing every species of cruelty which barbarity could suggest , and humanity deplore . In fourteen years after , David established him by force in the domain he had impoverished , and he married Aaliza daughter and heiress of William de Meschines a neighbouring Earl . They had a son commonly called the Boy of Egremont ( from one of his grandfather 's baronies where he was born ) and who surviving his eldest brother became the sole hope of his family .</p>
    <p n="26">This youth in his sixteenth year , inconsiderately bounding over this terrific chasm with a greyhound in his leash , the affrighted animal hung back and drew his unfortunate master into the torrent .— The forester who accompanied young Romille ( the Boy of Egremont ) returned to the Lady Aaliza , and with a despairing countenance said , “ What is good for a bootless bene ? ” to which the mother apprehending some great calamity had befallen her son , answered , “ endless sorrow . ” — The language of this question proves the antiquity of the story ; its meaning appears to have been , what remains when prayer is useless .</p>
    <p n="27">This fatal accident induced the Lady Aaliza to translate the Priory of Embsay , founded by her parents from thence to Bolton on account of its proximity to the scene of her son 's deplorable death .</p>

    <p n="29">N. B . Six fine coloured prints of views in Bolton have been published from original pictures painted on the spot , by T. C. Hofland , among which is an admirable representation of the Strid .</p>
    <p n="30">Farewell to your Doctors , &amp; c .— v . 1180 .— Mr . Blunderhead was undoubtedly right in this observation , as perhaps not one watering place can boast medical men of equal ability and liberality , affording so striking a contrast with those “ condemn 'd to endless fame , ” by the memoirs of his celebrated uncle .</p>
