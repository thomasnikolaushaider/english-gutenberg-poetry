    <docTitle><titlePart>THE COMPLETE POEMS OF SIR THOMAS MOORE COLLECTED BY HIMSELF WITH EXPLANATORY NOTES WITH A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY WILLIAM M. ROSSETTI THOMAS MOORE Thomas Moore was born in Dublin on the 28th of May 1780 . Both his parents were Roman-Catholics ; and he was , as a matter of course , brought up in the same religion , and adhered to it — not perhaps with any extreme zeal — throughout his life . His father was a decent tradesman , a grocer and spirit-retailer — or “ spirit-grocer , ” as the business is termed in Ireland . Thomas received his schooling from Mr. Samuel Whyte , who had been Sheridan 's first preceptor , a man of more than average literary culture . He encouraged a taste for acting among the boys : and Moore , naturally intelligent and lively , became a favorite with his master , and a leader in the dramatic recreations .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>His aptitude for verse appeared at an early age . In<date>1790</date>he composed an epilogue to a piece acted at the house of Lady Borrows , in<settlement>Dublin</settlement>; and in his fourteenth year he wrote a sonnet to Mr. Whyte , which was published in a<settlement>Dublin</settlement>magazine .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Like other Irish Roman-Catholics , galled by the hard and stiff collar of Protestant ascendancy , the parents of Thomas Moore hailed the French Revolution , and the prospects which it seemed to offer of some reflex ameliorations . In 1792 the lad was taken by his father to a dinner in honor of the Revolution ; and he was soon launched upon a current of ideas and associations which might have conducted a person of more self-oblivious patriotism to the scaffold on which perished the friend of his opening manhood , Robert Emmet . Trinity College , Dublin , having been opened to Catholics by the Irish Parliament in 1793 , Moore was entered there as a student in the succeeding year . He became more proficient in French and Italian than in the classic languages , and showed no turn for Latin verses . Eventually , his political proclivities , and intimacy with many of the chiefs of opposition , drew down upon him ( after various interrogations , in which he honorably refused to implicate his friends ) a severe admonition from the University authorities ; but he had not joined in any distinctly rebellious act and no more formidable results ensued to him .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <l n="2">In 1793 Moore published in the Anthologia Hibernica two pieces of verse ;</l>
     <l n="3">and his budding talents became so far known as to earn him the proud</l>
     <l n="4">eminence of Laureate to the Gastronomic Club of Dalkey , near Dublin , in</l>
     <l n="5">1794 . Through his acquaintance with Emmet , he joined the Oratorical</l>
     <l n="6">Society , and afterwards the more important Historical Society ; and he</l>
     <l n="7">published An Ode on Nothing , with Notes , by Trismegistus Rustifucius , D .</l>
     <l n="8">D ., which won a party success . About the same time he wrote articles for</l>
     <l n="9">The Press , a paper founded towards the end of 1797 by O'Connor , Addis ,</l>
     <l n="10">Emmet , and others . He graduated at Trinity College in November , 1799 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The bar was the career which his parents , and especially his mother , wished Thomas to pursue ; neither of them had much faith in poetry or literature as a resource for his subsistence . Accordingly , in 1799 , he crossed over into England , and studied in the Middle Temple ; and he was afterwards called to the bar , but literary pursuits withheld him from practicing . He had brought with him from Ireland his translations from Anacreon ; and published these by subscription in 1800 , dedicated to the Prince Regent ( then the illusory hope of political reformers ) , with no inconsiderable success . Lord Moira , Lady Donegal , and other leaders of fashionable society , took him up with friendly warmth , and he soon found himself a well-accepted guest in the highest circles in London . No clever young fellow — without any advantage of birth or of person , and with intellectual attractions which seem to posterity to be of a rather middling kind — ever won his way more easily or more cheaply into that paradise of mean ambitions , the beau monde . Moore has not escaped the stigma which attaches to almost all men who thus succeeded under the like conditions — that of tuft-hunting and lowering compliances . He would be a bold man who should affirm that there was absolutely no sort of ground for the charge ; or that Moore — fêted at Holland House , and hovered-round by the fashionable of both sexes , the men picking up his witticisms , and the women languishing over his songs — was capable of the same sturdy self-reliance and simple adhesion to principle which might possibly have been in him , and forthcoming from him , under different conditions . Who shall touch pitch and not be defiled ,— who treacle , and not be sweetened ? At the same time , it is easy to carry charges of this kind too far , and not always through motives the purest and most exalted . It may be said without unfairness on either side that the sort of talents which Moore possessed brought him naturally into the society which he frequented ; that very possibly the world has got quite as much out of him by that development of his faculties as by any other which they could have been likely to receive ; and that he repaid patronage in the coin of amusement and of bland lenitives , rather than in that of obsequious adulation . For we are not required nor permitted to suppose that there was the stuff of a hero in “ little Tom Moore ; ” or that the lapdog of the drawing-room would under any circumstances have been the wolf-hound of the public sheepfold . In the drawing-room he is a sleeker lapdog , and lies upon more and choicelier-clothed laps than he would in “ the two-pair back ; ” and that is about all that needs to be said or speculated in such a case . As a matter of fact , the demeanor of Moore among the socially great seems to have been that of a man who respected his company , without failing to respect himself also — any ill-natured caviling or ready-made imputations to the contrary notwithstanding .</p>
   <p>In 1802 Moore produced his first volume of original verse , the Poetical Works of the late Thomas Little ( an allusion to the author 's remarkably small stature ) , for which he received £ 60 . There are in this volume some erotic improprieties , not of a very serious kind either in intention or in harmfulness , which Moore regretted in later years . Next year Lord Moira procured him the post of Registrar to the Admiralty Court of Bermuda ; he embarked on the 25th of September , and reached his destination in January 1804 . This work did not suit him much better than the business of the bar ; in March he withdrew from personal discharge of the duties : and , leaving a substitute in his place , he made a tour in the United States and Canada . He was presented to Jefferson , and felt impressed by his republican simplicity . Such a quality , however , was not in Moore 's line ; and nothing perhaps shows the essential smallness of his nature more clearly than the fact that his visit to the United States , in their giant infancy , produced in him no glow of admiration or aspiration , but only a recrudescence of the commonest prejudices — the itch for picking little holes , the petty joy of reporting them , and the puny self-pluming upon fancied or factitious superiorities . If the washy liberal patriotism of Moore 's very early years had any vitality at all , such as would have qualified it for a harder struggle than jeering at the Holy Alliance , and singing after-dinner songs of national sentimentalism to the applause of Whig lords and ladies , this American experience may beheld to have been its death-blow . He now saw republicans face to face ; and found that they were not for him , nor he for them . He returned to England in 1806 ; and soon afterwards published his Odes and Epistles , comprising many remarks , faithfully expressive of his perceptions , on American society and manners .</p>
   <p>The volume was tartly criticised in the Edinburgh Review by Jeffrey , who made some rather severe comments upon the improprieties chargeable to Moore 's early writings . The consequence was a challenge , and what would have been a duel at Chalk Farm , but for unloaded pistols and police interference . This fiasco soon led to an amicable understanding between Moore and Jeffrey ; and a few years later , about the end of 1811 , to a friendship of closer intimacy between the Irish songster and his great poetic contemporary Lord Byron . His lordship , in his youthful satire of English Bards and Scotch Reviewers , had made fun of the unbloody duel . This Moore resented , not so much as a mere matter of ridicule as because it involved an ignoring or a denial of a counter-statement of the matter put into print by himself . He accordingly wrote a letter to Byron on the 1st of January 1810 , calculated to lead to further hostilities . But , as the noble poet had then already for some months left England for his prolonged tour on the Continent , the missive did not reach him ; and a little epistolary skirmishing , after his return in the following year , terminated in a hearty reconciliation , and a very intimate cordiality , almost deserving of the lofty name of friendship , on both sides .</p>
   <p>Re-settled in London , and re-quartered upon the pleasant places of fashion , Moore was once more a favorite at Holland House , Lansdowne House , and Donington House , the residence of Lord Moira . His lordship obtained a comfortable post to soothe the declining years of Moore 's father , and held out to the poet himself the prospect — which was not however realized — of another snug berth for his own occupancy . The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland never received the benefit of the Irish patriot 's services in any public capacity at home — only through the hands of a defaulting deputy in Bermuda : it did , however , at length give him the money without the official money'shYpppHeNworth , for in 1835 , under Lord Melbourne 's ministry , an annual literary pension of £ 300 was bestowed upon the then elderly poet . Nor can it be said that Moore 's worth to his party , whether we regard him as political sharpshooter or as national lyrist , deserved a less recognition from the Whigs : he had at one time , with creditable independence , refused to be indebted to the Tories for an appointment . Some obloquy has at times been cast upon him on account of his sarcasms against the Prince Regent , which , however well merited on public grounds , have been held to come with an ill grace from the man whose first literary effort , the Anacreon , had been published under the auspices of his Royal Highness as dedicatee , no doubt a practical obligation of some moment to the writer . It does not appear , however , that the obligation went much beyond this simple acceptance of the dedication : Moore himself declared that the Regent 's further civilities had consisted simply in asking him twice to dinner , and admitting him , in 1811 , to a fête in honor of the regency .</p>
   <p>The life of Moore for several years ensuing is one of literary success and social brilliancy , varied by his marrying in 1811 , Miss Bessy Dyke , a lady who made an excellent and devoted wife , and to whom he was very affectionately attached , although the attractions and amenities of the fashionable world caused from time to time considerable inroads upon his domesticity . After a while , he removed from London , with his wife and young family , to Mayfield Cottage , near Ashbourne , Derbyshire — a somewhat lonely site . His Irish Melodies , the work by which he will continue best known , had their origin in 1797 , when his attention was drawn to a publication named Bunting 's Irish Melodies , for which he occasionally wrote the words . In 1807 he entered into a definite agreement with Mr. Power on this subject , in combination with Sir J. Stevenson , who undertook to compose the accompaniments . The work was prolonged up to the year 1834 ; and contributed very materially to Moore 's comfort in money matters and his general prominence — as his own singing of the Melodies in good society kept up his sentimental and patriotic prestige , and his personal lionizing , in a remarkable degree . He played on the piano , and sang with taste , though in a style resembling recitative , and not with any great power of voice : in speaking , his voice had a certain tendency to hoarseness , but its quality became flute-like in singing . In 1811 he made another essay in the musical province ; writing , at the request of the manager of the Lyceum Theatre , an operetta named M. P ., or the Bluestocking . It was the reverse of a stage-success ; and Moore , in collecting his poems , excluded this work , save as regards some of the songs comprised in it . In 1808 had appeared anonymously , the poems of Intolerance and Corruption , followed in 1809 by The Sceptic . Intercepted Letters , or The Twopenny Postbag , by Thomas Brown the Younger , came out in 1812 : it was a huge success , and very intelligibly such , going through fourteen editions in one year . In the same year the project of writing an oriental poem — a class of work greatly in vogue now that Byron was inventing Giaours and Corsairs — was seriously entertained by Moore . This project took shape in Lalla Rookh , written chiefly at Mayfield Cottage — a performance for which Mr. Longman the publisher paid the extremely large sum of £ 3150 in advance : its publication hung over till 1817 . The poem has been translated into all sorts of languages , including Persian , and is said to have found many admirers among its oriental readers . Whatever may be thought of its poetic merits — and I for one disclaim any scintilla of enthusiasm — or of its power in vitalizing the disjecta membra of orientalism , the stock-in-trade of the Asiatic curiosity-shop , there is no doubt that Moore worked very conscientiously upon this undertaking : he read up to any extent ,— wrote , talked , and perhaps thought , Islamically — and he trips up his reader with some allusion verse after verse , tumbling him to the bottom of the page , with its quagmire of explanatory footnotes . In 1815 appeared the National Airs ; in 1816 , Sacred Songs , Duets , and Trios , the music composed and selected by Stevenson and Moore ; in 1818 , The Fudge Family in Paris , again a great hit . This work was composed in Paris , which capital Moore had been visiting in company with his friend Samuel Rogers the poet .</p>
   <p>The easily earned money and easily discharged duties of the appointment in Bermuda began now to weigh heavy on Moore . Defalcations of his deputy , to the extent of £ 6000 , were discovered , for which the nominal holder of the post was liable . Moore declined offers of assistance ; and , pending a legal decision on the matter , he had found it apposite to revisit the Continent . In France , Lord John ( the late Earl ) Russell was his travelling companion : they went on together through Switzerland , and parted at Milan . Moore then , on the 8th of October 1819 , joined in Venice his friend Byron , who had been absent from England since 1816 . The poets met in the best of humor , and on terms of hearty good-fellowship — Moore staying with Byron for five or six days . On taking leave of him , Byron presented the Irish lyrist with the MS. of his autobiographical memoirs stipulating that they should not be published till after the donor 's death : at a later date he became anxious that they should remain wholly unpublished . Moore sold the MS. in 1831 to Murray for £ 2100 , after some negotiations with Longman , and consigned it to the publisher 's hands . In 1824 the news arrived of Byron 's death . Mr. ( afterwards Sir Wilmot ) Horton on the part of Lady Byron , Mr. Luttrell on that of Moore , Colonel Doyle on that of Mrs. Leigh , Lord Byron 's half-sister , and Mr. Hobhouse ( afterwards Lord Broughton ) as a friend and executor of the deceased poet , consulted on the subject . Hobhouse was strong in urging the suppression of the Memoirs . The result was that Murray , setting aside considerations of profit , burned the MS. ( some principal portions of which nevertheless exist in print , in other forms of publication ) ; and Moore immediately afterwards , also in a disinterested spirit , repaid him the purchase-money of £ 2100 . It was quite fair that Moore should be reimbursed this large sum by some of the persons in whose behoof he had made the sacrifice , this was not neglected .</p>
   <p>To resume . Bidding adieu to Byron at Venice , Moore went on to Rome with the sculptor Chantrey and the portrait-painter Jackson . His tour supplied the materials for the Rhymes on the Road , published , as being extracted from the journal of a travelling member of the Pococurante Society , in 1820 , along with the Fables for the Holy Alliance . Lawrence , Turner , and Eastlake , were also much with Moore in Rome : and here he made acquaintance with Canova . Hence he returned to Paris , and made that city his home up to 1822 , expecting the outcome of the Bermuda affair . He also resided partly at Butte Goaslin , near Sèvres , with a rich and hospitable Spanish family named Villamil . The debt of £ 6000 was eventually reduced to £ 750 : both the Marquis of Lansdowne and Lord John Russell pressed Moore with their friendly offers , and the advance which he at last accepted was soon repaid out of the profits of the Loves of the Angels — which poem , chiefly written in Paris , was published in 1823 . The prose tale of The Epicurean was composed about the same time , but did not issue from the press till 1827 : the Memoirs of Captain Rock in 1824 . He had been under an engagement to a bookseller to write a Life of Sheridan . During his stay in France the want of documents withheld him from proceeding with this work : but he ultimately took it up , and brought it out in 1825 . It was not availed to give Moore any reputation as a biographer , though the reader in search of amusement will pick out of it something to suit him . George the Fourth is credited with having made a neat bon mot upon this book . Some one having remarked to him that “ Moore had been murdering Sheridan , ” — “ No , ” replied his sacred majesty , “ but he has certainly attempted his life . ” A later biographical performance , published in 1830 , and one of more enduring interest to posterity , was the Life of Byron . This is a very fascinating book ; but more — which is indeed a matter of course — in virtue of the lavish amount of Byron 's own writing which it embodies than , on account of the Memoir-compiler 's doings . However , there is a considerable share of good feeling in the book , as well as matter of permanent value from the personal knowledge that Moore had of Byron ; and the avoidance of “ posing ” and of dealing with the subject for purposes of effect , in the case of a man whose career and genius lent themselves so insidiously to such a treatment , is highly creditable to the biographer 's good sense and taste . The Life of Byron succeeded , in the list of Moore 's writings , a History of Ireland , contributed in 1827 to Lardner 's Cyclopaedia , and the Travels of an Irishman in Search of a Religion , published in the same year : and was followed by a Life of Lord Edward Fitzgerald , issued in 1881 . This , supplemented by some minor productions , closes the sufficiently long list of writings of an industrious literary life .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In his latter years Moore resided at Sloperton Cottage , near Devizes in</l>
     <l n="2">Wiltshire , Where he was near the refined social circle of Lord Lansdowne</l>
     <l n="3">at Bowood , as well as the lettered home of the Rev . Mr. Bowles at</l>
     <l n="4">Bremhill . Domestic sorrows clouded his otherwise cheerful and comfortable</l>
     <l n="5">retirement . One of his sons died in the French military service in</l>
     <l n="6">Algeria ; another of consumption in 1842 . For some years before his own</l>
     <l n="7">death , which occurred on the 25th of February 1853 , his mental powers had</l>
     <l n="8">collapsed . He sleeps in Bromham Cemetery , in the neighborhood of</l>
     <l n="9">Sloperton .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Moore had a very fair share of learning , as well as steady application , greatly as he sacrificed to the graces of life , and especially of “ good society . ” His face was not perhaps much more impressive in its contour than his diminutive figure . His eyes , however , were dark and fine ; his forehead bony , and with what a phrenologist would recognize as large bumps of wit ; the mouth pleasingly dimpled . His manner and talk were bright , abounding rather in lively anecdote and point than in wit and humor , strictly so called . To term him amiable according to any standard , and estimable too as men of an unheroic fibre go , is no more than his due .</p>
   <p>No doubt the world has already seen the most brilliant days of Moore 's poetry . Its fascinations are manifestly of the more temporary sort : partly through fleetingness of subject-matter and evanescence of allusion ( as in the clever and still readable satirical poems ) ; partly through the aroma of sentimental patriotism , hardly strong enough in stamina to make the compositions national , or to maintain their high level of popularity after the lyrist himself has long been at rest ; partly through the essentially commonplace sources and forms of inspiration which belong to his more elaborate and ambitious works . No poetical reader of the present day is the poorer for knowing absolutely nothing of Lalla Rookh or the Loves of the Angels . What then will be the hold or the claim of these writings upon a reader of the twenty-first century ? If we expect the satirical compositions , choice in a different way , the best things of Moore are to be sought in the Irish Melodies , to which a considerable share of merit , and of apposite merit , is not to be denied : yet even here what deserts around the oases , and the oases themselves how soon exhaustible and forgettable ! There are but few thoroughly beautiful and touching lines in the whole of Moore 's poetry . Here is one —</p>
   <p>“ Come rest in this bosom , mine own stricken deer . ”</p>
   <p>A great deal has been said upon the overpowering “ lusciousness ” of his poetry , and the magical “ melody ” of his verse : most of this is futile . There is in the former as much of fadeur as of lusciousness ; and a certain tripping or trotting exactitude , not less fully reducible to the test of scansion than of a well-attuned ear , is but a rudimentary form of melody — while of harmony or rhythmic volume of sound Moore is as decisively destitute as any correct versifier can well be . No clearer proof of the incapacity of the mass of critics and readers to appreciate the calibre of poetical work in point of musical and general execution could be given than the fact that Moore has always with them passed , and still passes , for an eminently melodious poet . What then remains ? Chiefly this . In one class of writing , liveliness of witty banter , along with neatness ; and , in the other and ostensibly more permanent class , elegance , also along with neatness . Reduce these qualities to one denomination , and we come to something that may be called “ Propriety ": a sufficiently disastrous “ raw material ” for the purposes of a poet , and by no means loftily to be praised or admired even when regarded as the outer investiture of a nobler poetic something within . But let desert of every kind have its place , and welcome . In the cosmical diapason and august orchestra of poetry , Tom Moore 's little Pan'shYpppHeNpipe can at odd moments be heard , and interjects an appreciable and rightly-combined twiddle or two . To be gratified with these at the instant is no more than the instrument justifies , and the executant claims : to think much about them when the organ is pealing or the violin plaining ( with a Shelley performing on the first , or a Mrs. Browning on the second ) , or to be on the watch for their recurrences , would be equally superfluous and weak-minded .</p>

   <p>THOMAS MOORE .</p>
   <p>REMARKS ON ANACREON</p>
   <p>There is but little known , with certainty of the life of Anacreon . Chamaeleon Heracleotes , who wrote upon the subject , has been lost in the general wreck of ancient literature . The editors of the poet have collected the few trifling anecdotes which are scattered through the extant authors of antiquity , and , supplying the deficiency of materials by fictions of their own imagination , have arranged what they call a life of Anacreon . These specious fabrications are intended to indulge that interest which we naturally feel in the biography of illustrious men ; but it is rather a dangerous kind of illusion , as it confounds the limits of history and romance , and is too often supported by unfaithful citation .</p>
   <p>Our poet was born in the city of Teos , in the delicious region of Ionia , and the time of his birth appears to have been in the sixth century before Christ . He flourished at that remarkable period when , under the polished tyrants Hipparchus and Polycrates , Athens and Samos were become the rival asylums of genius . There is nothing certain known about his family ; and those who pretend to discover in Plato that he was a descendant of the monarch Codrus , show much more of zeal than of either accuracy or judgment .</p>
   <p>The disposition and talents of Anacreon recommended him to the monarch of Samos , and he was formed to be the friend of such a prince as Polycrates . Susceptible only to the pleasures , he felt not the corruptions , of the court ; and while Pythagoras fled from the tyrant , Anacreon was celebrating his praises oh the lyre . We are told , too , by Maximus Tyrius , that , by the influence of his amatory songs , he softened the mind of Polycrates into a spirit of benevolence towards his subjects .</p>
   <p>The amours of the poet , and the rivalship of the tyrant , I shall pass over in silence ; and there are few , I presume , who will regret the omission of most of those anecdotes , which the industry of some editors has not only promulged , but discussed . Whatever is repugnant to modesty and virtue is considered , in ethical science , by a supposition very favorable to humanity , as impossible ; and this amiable persuasion should be much more strongly entertained where the transgression wars with nature as well as virtue . But why are we not allowed to indulge in the presumption ? Why are we officiously reminded that there have been really such instances of depravity ?</p>
   <p>Hipparchus , who now maintained at Athens the power which his father Pisistratus had usurped , was one of those princes who may be said to have polished the fetters of their subjects . He was the first , according to Plato , who edited the poems of Homer , and commanded them to be sung by the rhapsodists at the celebration of the Panathenaea . From his court , which was a sort of galaxy of genius , Anacreon could not long be absent . Hipparchus sent a barge for him ; the poet readily embraced the invitation , and the Muses and the Loves were wafted with him to Athens .</p>
   <p>The manner of Anacreon 's death was singular . We are told that in the eighty-fifth year of his age he was choked by a grape-stone ; and however we may smile at their enthusiastic partiality who see in this easy and characteristic death a peculiar indulgence of Heaven , we cannot help admiring that his fate should have been so emblematic of his disposition . Caelius Calcagninus alludes to this catastrophe in the following epitaph on our poet :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Those lips , then , hallowed sage , which poured along</l>
     <l n="2">A music sweet as any cygnet 's song ,</l>
     <l n="3">The grape hath closed for ever !</l>
     <l n="4">Here let the ivy kiss the poet 's tomb ,</l>
     <l n="5">Here let the rose he loved with laurels bloom ,</l>
     <l n="6">In bands that ne'er shall sever .</l>
     <l n="7">But far be thou , oh ! far , unholy vine ,</l>
     <l n="8">By whom the favorite minstrel of the Nine</l>
     <l n="9">Lost his sweet vital breath ;</l>
     <l n="10">Thy God himself now blushes to confess ,</l>
     <l n="11">Once hallowed vine ! he feels he loves thee less ,</l>
     <l n="12">Since poor Anacreon 's death .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It has been supposed by some writers that Anacreon and Sappho were contemporaries ; and the very thought of an intercourse between persons so congenial , both in warmth of passion and delicacy of genius , gives such play to the imagination that the mind loves to indulge in it . But the vision dissolves before historical truth ; and Chamaeleon , and Hermesianax , who are the source of the supposition , are considered as having merely indulged in a poetical anachronism .</p>
   <p>To infer the moral dispositions of a poet from the tone of sentiment which pervades his works , is sometimes a very fallacious analogy ; but the soul of Anacreon speaks so unequivocally through his odes , that we may safely consult them as the faithful mirrors of his heart . We find him there the elegant voluptuary , diffusing the seductive charm of sentiment over passions and propensities at which rigid morality must frown . His heart , devoted to indolence , seems to have thought that there is wealth enough in happiness , but seldom happiness in mere wealth . The cheerfulness , indeed , with which he brightens his old age is interesting and endearing ; like his own rose , he is fragrant even in decay . But the most peculiar feature of his mind is that love of simplicity , which be attributes to himself so feelingly , and which breathes characteristically throughout all that he has sung . In truth , if we omit those few vices in our estimate which religion , at that time , not only connived at , but consecrated , we shall be inclined to say that the disposition of our poet was amiable ; that his morality was relaxed , but not abandoned ; and that Virtue , with her zone loosened , may be an apt emblem of the character of Anacreon .</p>
   <p>Of his person and physiognomy , time has preserved such uncertain memorials , that it were better , perhaps , to leave the pencil to fancy ; and few can read the Odes of Anacreon without imaging to themselves the form of the animated old bard , crowned with roses , and singing cheerfully to his lyre .</p>
   <p>After the very enthusiastic eulogiums bestowed both by ancients and moderns upon the poems of Anacreon , we need not be diffident in expressing our raptures at their beauty , nor hesitate to pronounce them the most polished remains of antiquity . They are indeed , all beauty , all enchantment . He steals us so insensibly along with him , that we sympathize even in his excesses . In his amatory odes there is a delicacy of compliment not to be found in any other ancient poet . Love at that period was rather an unrefined emotion ; and the intercourse of the sexes was animated more by passion than by sentiment . They knew not those little tendernesses which form the spiritual part of affection ; their expression of feeling was therefore rude and unvaried , and the poetry of love deprived it of its most captivating graces . Anacreon , however , attained some ideas of this purer gallantry ; and the same delicacy of mind which led him to this refinement , prevented him also from yielding to the freedom of language which has sullied the pages of all the other poets . His descriptions are warm ; but the warmth is in the ideas , not the words . He is sportive without being wanton , and ardent without being licentious . His poetic invention is always most brilliantly displayed in those allegorical fictions which so many have endeavored to imitate , though all have confessed them to be inimitable . Simplicity is the distinguishing feature of these odes , and they interest by their innocence , as much as they fascinate by their beauty . They may be said , indeed , to be the very infants of the Muses , and to lisp in numbers .</p>
   <p>I shall not be accused of enthusiastic partiality by those who have read and felt the original ; but to others , I am conscious , this should not be the language of a translator , whose faint reflection of such beauties can but ill justify his admiration of them .</p>
   <p>In the age of Anacreon music and poetry were inseparable . These kindred talents were for a long time associated , and the poet always sung his own compositions to the lyre . It is probable that they were not set to any regular air , but rather a kind of musical recitation , which was varied according to the fancy and feelings of the moment . The poems of Anacreon were sung at banquets as late as the time of Aulus Gellius , who tells us that he heard one of the odes performed at a birthday entertainment .</p>
   <p>The singular beauty of our poet 's style and the apparent facility , perhaps , of his metre have attracted , as I have already remarked , a crowd of imitators . Some of these have succeeded with wonderful felicity , as may be discerned in the few odes which are attributed to writers of a later period . But none of his emulators have been half so dangerous to his fame as those Greek ecclesiastics of the early ages , who , being conscious of their own inferiority to their great prototypes , determined on removing all possibility of comparison , and , under a semblance of moral zeal , deprived the world of some of the most exquisite treasures of ancient times . The works of Sappho and Alcaeus were among those flowers of Grecian literature which thus fell beneath the rude hand of ecclesiastical presumption . It is true they pretended that this sacrifice of genius was hallowed by the interests of religion , but I have already assigned the most probable motive ; and if Gregorius Nazianzenus had not written Anacreontics , we might now perhaps have the works of the Teian unmutilated , and be empowered to say exultingly with Horace ,</p>
   <p>Nec si quid olim lusit Anacreon delevit aetas .</p>
   <p>The zeal by which these bishops professed to be actuated gave birth more innocently , indeed , to an absurd species of parody , as repugnant to piety as it is to taste , where the poet of voluptuousness was made a preacher of the gospel , and his muse , like the Venus in armor at Lacedaemon , was arrayed in all the severities of priestly instruction . Such was the “ Anacreon Recantatus , ” by Carolus de Aquino , a Jesuit , published 1701 , which consisted of a series of palinodes to the several songs of our poet . Such , too , was the Christian Anacreon of Patrignanus , another Jesuit , who preposterously transferred to a most sacred subject all that the Graecian poet had dedicated to festivity and love .</p>
   <p>His metre has frequently been adopted by the modern Latin poets ; and Scaliger , Taubman , Barthius , and others , have shown that it is by no means uncongenial with that language . The Anacreontics of Scaliger , however , scarcely deserve the name ; as they glitter all over with conceits , and , though often elegant , are always labored . The beautiful fictions of Angerianus preserve more happily than any others the delicate turn of those allegorical fables , which , passing so frequently through the mediums of version and imitation , have generally lost their finest rays in the transmission . Many of the Italian poets have indulged their fancies upon the subjects ; and in the manner of Anacreon , Bernardo Tasso first introduced the metre , which was afterwards polished and enriched by Chabriera and others .</p>

     <l n="12">The fragrance of the racy tide ;</l>

     <l n="14">He came my cordial kiss to meet ,</l>
     <l n="15">An infant , of the Cyprian band ,</l>
     <l n="16">Guided him on with tender hand .</l>
     <l n="17">Quick from his glowing brows he drew</l>
     <l n="18">His braid , of many a wanton hue ;</l>
     <l n="19">I took the wreath , whose inmost twine</l>
     <l n="20">Breathed of him and blushed with wine .</l>
     <l n="21">I hung it o'er my thoughtless brow ,</l>
     <l n="22">And ah ! I feel its magic now :</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Respecting the barbiton a host of authorities may be collected , which , after all , leave us ignorant of the nature of the instrument . There is scarcely any point upon which we are so totally uninformed as the music of the ancients . The authors extant upon the subject are , I imagine , little understood ; and certainly if one of their moods was a progression by quarter-tones , which we are told was the nature of the enharmonic scale , simplicity was by no means the characteristic of their melody ; for this is a nicety of progression of which modern music is not susceptible . The invention of the barbiton is , by Athenaeus , attributed to Anacreon .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The introduction of these deities to the festival is merely allegorical . Madame Dacier thinks that the poet describes a masquerade , where these deities were personated by the company in masks . The translation will conform with either idea .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This spirited poem is a eulogy on the rose ; and again , in the fifty - fifth ode , we shall find our author rich in the praises of that flower . In a fragment of Sappho , in the romance of Achilles Tatius , to which Barnes refers us , the rose is fancifully styled “ the eye of flowers ; ” and the same poetess , in another fragment , calls the favors of the Muse “ the roses of the Pleria . ”</p>

   <p>From the idea of peculiar excellence , which the ancients attached to this flower , arose a pretty proverbial expression , used by Aristophanes , according to Suidas “ You have spoken roses . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>In the original here , he enumerates the many epithets of beauty , borrowed from roses , which were used by the poets . We see that poets were dignified in Greece with the title of sages : even the careless Anacreon , who lived but for love and voluptuousness , was called by Plato the wise Anacreon — fuit haec sapienta quondam .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>He here alludes to the use of the rose in embalming ; and , perhaps ( as Barnes thinks ) , to the rosy unguent with which Venus anointed the corpse of Hector .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The author of the “ Pervigilium Veneris ” ( a poem attributed to Catullus , the style of which appears to me to have all the labored luxuriance of a much later period ) ascribes the tincture of the rose to the blood from the wound of Adonis .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This ode is a very animated description of a picture of Venus on a discus , which represented the goddess in her first emergence from the waves . About two centuries after our poet wrote , the pencil of the artist Apelles embellished this subject , in his famous painting of the Venus Anadyomene , the model of which , as Pliny informs us , was the beautiful Campaspe , given to him by Alexander ; though , according to Natalis Comes , lib . vii . cap . 16 ., it was Phryne who sat to Apelles for the face and breast of this Venus .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The picture here has all the delicate character of the semi-reducta Venus , and affords a happy specimen of what the poetry of passion ought to be — glowing but through a veil , and stealing upon the heart from concealment . Few of the ancients have attained this modesty of description , which , like the golden cloud that hung over Jupiter and Juno , is impervious to every beam but that of fancy .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>There is a kind of pun in these words , as Madame Dacier has already remarked ; for Chrysos , which signifies gold , was also a frequent name for a slave . In one of Lucian 's dialogues , there is , I think , a similar play upon the word , where the followers of Chrysippus are called golden fishes . The puns of the ancients are , in general , even more vapid than our own ; some of the best are those recorded of Diogenes .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>This grace of iteration has already been taken notice of . Though sometimes merely a playful beauty , it is peculiarly expressive of impassioned sentiment , and we may easily believe that it was one of the many sources of that energetic sensibility which breathed through the style of Sappho .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Horace has Desiderique temperare poculum , not figuratively , however , like Anacreon , but importng the love-philtres of the witches . By “ cups of kisses ” our poet may allude to a favorite gallantry among the ancients , of drinking when the lips of their mistresses had touched the brim ;—</p>
   <p>“ Or leave a kiss within the cup And I 'll not ask for wine . ”</p>
   <p>As In Ben Jonson 's translation from Philostratus ; and Lucian has a conceit upon the same idea , “ that you may at once both drink and kiss . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This hymn to Apollo is supposed not to have been written by Anacreon ; and it is undoubtedly rather a sublimer flight than the Teian wing is accustomed to soar . But in a poet of whose works so small a proportion has reached us , diversity of style is by no means a safe criterion . If we knew Horace but as a satirist , should we easily believe there could dwell such animation in his lyre ? Suidas says that our poet wrote hymns , and this perhaps is one of them . We can perceive in what an altered and imperfect state his works are at present , when we find a scholiast upon Horace citing an ode from the third book of Anacreon .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This hymn to Diana is extant in Hephaestion . There is an anecdote of our poet , which has led some to doubt whether he ever wrote any odes of this kind . It is related by the Scholiast upon Pindar ( Isthmionic . od . ii . v. 1. as cited by Barnes ) that Anaecreon being asked why he addressed all his hymns to women , and none to the deities ? answered , “ Because women are my deities . ”</p>
   <p>I have assumed , it will be seen , in reporting this anecdote , the same liberty which I have thought it right to take in translating some of the odes ; and it were to be wished that these little infidelities were always allowable in interpreting the writings of the ancients .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Lethe , a river of Iona , according to Strabo , falling into the Meander . In its neighborhood was the city called Magnesia , in favor of whose inhabitants our poet is supposed to have addressed this supplication to Diana . It was written ( as Madame Dacier conjectures ) on the occasion of some battle , in which the Magnesians had been defeated .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This ode , which is addressed to some Thracian girl , exists in Heraclides , and has been imitated very frequently by Horace , as all the annotators have remarked . Madame Dacier rejects the allegory , which runs so obviously through the poem , and supposes it to have been addressed to a young mare belonging to Polycrates .</p>
   <p>Pierius , in the fourth book of his “ Hieroglyphics , ” cites this ode , and informs us that the horse was the hieroglyphical emblem of pride .</p>

    <head>TO JOSEPH ATKINSON , ESQ .</head>
    <head>MY DEAR SIR ,</head>
    <head>I feel a very sincere pleasure in dedicating to you the Second Edition of our friend LITTLE 'S Poems . I am not unconscious that there are many in the collection which perhaps it would be prudent to have altered or omitted ; and , to say the truth , I more than once revised them for that purpose ; but , I know not why , I distrusted either my heart or my judgment ; and the consequence is you have them in their original form :</head>
     <l n="1">non possunt nostros multae , Faustine , liturae</l>
     <l n="2">emendare jocos ; una litura potest .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am convinced , however , that , though not quite a casuiste relâché , you have charity enough to forgive such inoffensive follies : you know that the pious Beza was not the less revered for those sportive Juvenilia which he published under a fictitious name ; nor did the levity of Bembo 's poems prevent him from making a very good cardinal .</p>
   <p>Believe me , my dear friend .</p>
   <p>With the truest esteem ,</p>
   <p>Yours ,</p>

     <l n="14">And so , perhaps , will every thrill</l>
     <l n="15">Of feeling soon be lulled to rest ,</l>
     <l n="16">Which late I waked in Anna 's breast .</l>
     <l n="17">Yet , no — the simple notes I played</l>
     <l n="18">From memory 's tablet soon may fade ;</l>
     <l n="19">The songs , which Anna loved to hear ,</l>
     <l n="20">May vanish from her heart and ear ;</l>
     <l n="21">But friendship 's voice shall ever find</l>
     <l n="22">An echo in that gentle mind ,</l>
     <l n="23">Nor memory lose nor time impair</l>
     <l n="24">The sympathies that tremble there .</l>

   <p>PREFACE .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>The principal poems in the following collection were written during an absence of fourteen months from Europe . Though curiosity was certainly not the motive of my voyage to America , yet it happened that the gratification of curiosity was the only advantage which I derived from it . Finding myself in the country of a new people , whose infancy had promised so much , and whose progress to maturity has been an object of such interesting speculation , I determined to employ the short period of time , which my plan of return to Europe afforded me , in travelling through a few of the States , and acquiring some knowledge of the inhabitants .</p>
   <p>The impression which my mind received from the character and manners of these republicans , suggested the Epistles which are written from the city of Washington and Lake Erie .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>How far I was right in thus assuming the tone of a satirist against a people whom I viewed but as a stranger and a visitor , is a doubt which my feelings did not allow me time to investigate . All I presume to answer for is the fidelity of the picture which I have given ; and though prudence might have dictated gentler language , truth , I think , would have justified severer .</p>
   <p>I went to America with prepossessions by no means unfavorable , and indeed rather indulged in many of those illusive ideas , with respect to the purity of the government and the primitive happiness of the people , which I had early imbibed In my native country , where , unfortunately , discontent at home enhances every distant temptation , and the western world has long been looked to as a retreat from real or imaginary oppression ; as , in short , the elysian Atlantis , where persecuted patriots might find their visions realized , and be welcomed by kindred spirits to liberty and repose . In all these flattering expectations I found myself completely disappointed , and felt inclined to say to America , as Horace says to his mistress , “ intentata nites . ” Brissot , in the preface to his travels , observes , that “ freedom in that country is carried to so high a degree as to border upon a state of nature ; ” and there certainly is a close approximation to savage life not only in the liberty which they enjoy , but in the violence of party spirit and of private animosity which results from it . This illiberal zeal imbitters all social intercourse ; and , though I scarcely could hesitate in selecting the party , whose views appeared to me the more pure and rational , yet I was sorry to observe that , in asserting their opinions , they both assume an equal share of intolerance ; the Democrats consistently with their principles , exhibiting a vulgarity of rancor , which the Federalists too often are so forgetful of their cause as to imitate .</p>
   <p>The rude familiarity of the lower orders , and indeed the unpolished state of society in general , would neither surprise nor disgust if they seemed to flow from that simplicity of character , that honest ignorance of the gloss of refinement which may be looked for in a new and inexperienced people . But , when we find them arrived at maturity in most of the vices , and all the pride of civilization , while they are still so far removed from its higher and better characteristics , it is impossible not to feel that this youthful decay , this crude anticipation of the natural period of corruption , must repress every sanguine hope of the future energy and greatness of America .</p>
   <p>I am conscious that , in venturing these few remarks , I have said just enough to offend , and by no means sufficient to convince ; for the limits of a preface prevent me from entering into a justification of my opinions , and I am committed on the subject as effectually as if I had written volumes in their defence . My reader , however , is apprised of the very cursory observation upon which these opinions are founded , and can easily decide for himself upon the degree of attention or confidence which they merit .</p>
   <p>With respect to the poems in general , which occupy the following pages , I know not in what manner to apologize to the public for intruding upon their notice such a mass of unconnected trifles , such a world of epicurean atoms as I have here brought in conflict together . To say that I have been tempted by the liberal offers of my bookseller , is an excuse which can hope for but little indulgence from the critic ; yet I own that , without this seasonable inducement , these poems very possibly would never have been submitted to the world . The glare of publication is too strong for such imperfect productions : they should be shown but to the eye of friendship , in that dim light of privacy which is as favorable to poetical as to female beauty , and serves as a veil for faults , while it enhances every charm which it displays . Besides , this is not a period for the idle occupations of poetry , and times like the present require talents more active and more useful . Few have now the leisure to read such trifles , and I most sincerely regret that I have had the leisure to write them .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>It is the opinion of St. Austin upon Genesis , and I believe of nearly all the Fathers , that birds , like fish , were originally produced from the waters ; in defence of which idea they have collected every fanciful circumstance which can tend to prove a kindred similitude between them . With this thought in our minds , when we first see the Flying-Fish , we could almost fancy , that we are present at the moment of creation , and witness the birth of the first bird from the waves .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In days , my Kate , when life was new ,</l>
     <l n="2">When , lulled with innocence and you ,</l>
     <l n="3">I heard , in home 's beloved shade ,</l>
     <l n="4">The din the world at distance made ;</l>
     <l n="5">When , every night my weary head</l>
     <l n="6">Sunk on its own unthorned bed ,</l>
     <l n="7">And , mild as evening 's matron hour ,</l>
     <l n="8">Looks on the faintly shutting flower ,</l>
     <l n="9">A mother saw our eyelids close ,</l>
     <l n="10">And blest them into pure repose ;</l>
     <l n="11">Then , haply if a week , a day ,</l>
     <l n="12">I lingered from that home away ,</l>
     <l n="13">How long the little absence seemed !</l>
     <l n="14">How bright the look of welcome beamed ,</l>
     <l n="15">As mute you heard , with eager smile ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">Yet now , my Kate , a gloomy sea</l>

     <l n="20">Ere even that seal can reach mine eye .</l>

    <head>“ They tell of a young man , who lost his mind upon the death of a girl he loved , and who , suddenly disappearing from his friends , was never afterwards heard of . As he had frequently said , in his ravings , that the girl was not dead , but gone to the Dismal Swamp , it is supposed he had wandered into that dreary wilderness , and had died of hunger , or been lost in some of its dreadful morasses . ” — Anon .</head>

In the short but beautiful twilight of their spring evenings , the white cottages , scattered over the islands , and but partially seen through the trees that surround them , assume often the appearance of little Grecian temples ; and a vivid fancy may embellish the poor fisherman 's hut with columns such as the pencil of a Claude might imitate . I had one favorite object of this kind in my walks , which the hospitality of its owner robbed me of , by asking me to visit him .

The Driver sloop of war , in which I went , was built at Bermuda of cedar , and is accounted an excellent sea-boat .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ What will be the old age of this government , if it is thus early decrepit ! ” Such was the remark of Fauchet , the French minister at Philadelphia , in that famous despatch to his government , which was intercepted by one of our cruisers in the year 1794 . This curious memorial may be found in Porcupine 's Works , vol . i. p. 279 . It remains a striking monument of republican intrigue on one side and republican profligacy on the other ; and I would recommend the perusal of it to every honest politician , who may labor under a moment 's delusion with respect to the purity of American patriotism .</p>

    <head>DEDICATION</head>
    <head>TO THE MARCHIONESS DOWAGER OF DONEGAL .</head>
    <head>It is now many years since , in , a Letter prefixed to the Third Number of the Irish Melodies , I had the pleasure of inscribing the Poems of that work to your Ladyship , as to one whose character reflected honor on the country to which they relate , and whose friendship had long been the pride and happiness of their Author . With the same feelings of affection and respect , confirmed if not increased by the experience of every succeeding year , I now place those Poems in their present new form under your protection , and am ,</head>

   <p>THOMAS MOORE .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>Though an edition of the Poetry of the Irish Melodies , separate from the Music , has long been called for , yet , having , for many reasons , a strong objection to this sort of divorce , I should with difficulty have consented to a disunion of the words from the airs , had it depended solely upon me to keep them quietly and indissolubly together . But , besides the various shapes in which these , as well as my other lyrical writings , have been published throughout America , they are included , of course , in all the editions of my works printed on the Continent , and have also appeared , in a volume full of typographical errors , in Dublin . I have therefore readily acceded to the wish expressed by the Proprietor of the Irish Melodies , for a revised and complete edition of the poetry of the Work , though well aware that my verses must lose even more than the “ animae dimidium ” in being detached from the beautiful airs to which it was their good fortune to be associated .</p>

On this occasion a song was written by one of our bards , in which an Irish virgin is made to give the preference to her dear Coulin ( or the youth with the flowing locks ) to all strangers ( by which the English were meant ) , or those who wore their habits . Of this song , the air alone has reached us , and is universally admired . ” — “ Walker 's “ Historical Memoirs of Irish Bards , ” p. 184 .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>It is said that St. Patrick , when preaching the Trinity to the Pagan Irish , used to illustrate his subject by reference to that species of trefoil called in Ireland by the name of the Shamrock ; and hence , perhaps , the Island of Saints adopted this plant as her national emblem . Hope , among the ancients , was sometimes represented as a beautiful child , standing upon tiptoes , and a trefoil or three-colored grass in her hand .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>These stanzas are founded upon an event of most melancholy importance to Ireland ; if , as we are told by our Irish historians , it gave England the first opportunity of profiting by our divisions and subduing us . The following are the circumstances , as related by O'Halloran :— “ The king of Leinster had long conceived a violent affection for Dearbhorgil , daughter to the king of Meath , and though she had been for some time married to O'Ruark , prince of Breffni , yet it could not restrain his passion . They carried on a private correspondence , and she informed him that O'Ruark , intended soon to go on a pilgrimage ( an act of piety frequent in those days ) , and conjured him to embrace that opportunity of conveying her from a husband she detested to a lover she adored . MacMurchad too punctually obeyed the summons , and had the lady conveyed to his capital of Ferns . ” — The monarch Roderick espoused the cause of O'Ruark , while MacMurchad fled to England , and obtained the assistance of Henry II .</p>
   <p>“ Such , ” adds Giraldus Cambrensis ( as I find him in an old translation ) “ is the variable and fickle nature of woman , by whom all mischief in the world ( for the most part ) do happen and come , as may appear by Marcus Antonius , and by the destruction of Troy . ”</p>

   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>It is Cicero , I believe , who says “ naturâ , ad modes ducimur ; ” and the abundance of wild , indigenous airs , which almost every country , except England , possesses , sufficiently proves the truth of his assertion . The lovers of this simple , but interesting kind of music , are here presented with the first number of a collection , which , I trust , their contributions will enable us to continue . A pretty air without words resembles one of those half creatures of Plato , which are described as wandering in search of the remainder of themselves through the world . To supply this other half , by uniting with congenial words the many fugitive melodies which have hitherto had none ,— or only such as are unintelligible to the generality of their hearers ,— it is the object and ambition of the present work . Neither is it our intention to confine ourselves to what are strictly called National Melodies , but , wherever we meet with any wandering and beautiful air , to which poetry has not yet assigned a worthy home , we shall venture to claim it as an estray swan , and enrich our humble Hippocrene with its song .</p>

The sound of her marriage-bells seemed scarcely out of our ears when we heard of her death . During her last delirium she sung several hymns , in a voice even clearer and sweeter than usual , and among them were some from the present collection , ( particularly , “ There 's nothing bright but Heaven , ” ) which this very interesting girl had often heard me sing during the summer .</p>

   <p>A MELOLOGUE UPON NATIONAL MUSIC .</p>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>These verses were written for a Benefit at the Dublin Theatre , and were spoken by Miss Smith , with a degree of success , which they owed solely to her admirable manner of reciting them . I wrote them in haste ; and it very rarely happens that poetry which has cost but little labor to the writer is productive of any great pleasure to the reader . Under this impression , I certainly should not have published them if they had not found their way into some of the newspapers with such an addition of errors to their own original stock , that I thought it but fair to limit their responsibility to those faults alone which really belong to them .</p>
   <p>With respect to the title which I have invented for this Poem , I feel even more than the scruples of the Emperor Tiberius , when he humbly asked pardon of the Roman Senate for using “ the outlandish term , monopoly . ” But the truth is , having written the Poem with the sole view of serving a Benefit , I thought that an unintelligible word of this kind would not be without its attraction for the multitude , with whom , “ If ‘ tis not sense , at least ‘ tis Greek . ” To some of my readers , however , it may not be superfluous to say , that by “ Melologue , ” I mean that mixture of recitation of music , which is frequently adopted in the performance of Collins 's Ode on the Passions , and of which the most striking example I can remember is the prophetic speech of Joad in the Athalie of Racine .</p>

     <l n="14">And sings along the lengthening waste of snow ,</l>

   <p>THE SUMMER FÊTE .</p>
   <p>TO THE HONORABLE MRS. NORTON .</p>
   <p>For the groundwork of the following Poem I am indebted to a memorable Fête , given some years since , at Boyle Farm , the seat of the late Lord Henry Fitzgerald . In commemoration of that evening — of which the lady to whom these pages are inscribed was , I well recollect , one of the most distinguished ornaments — I was induced at the time to write some verses , which were afterwards , however , thrown aside unfinished , on my discovering that the same task had been undertaken by a noble poet ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>whose playful and happy jeu d'esprit on the subject has since been published . It was but lately , that , on finding the fragments of my own sketch among my papers , I thought of founding on them such a description of an imaginary Fête as might furnish me with situations for the introduction of music .</p>
   <p>Such is the origin and object of the following Poem , and to MRS. NORTON it is , with every feeling of admiration and regard , inscribed by her father 's warmly attached friend ,</p>
   <p>THOMAS MOORE .</p>
   <p>Sloperton Cottage ,</p>

     <l n="1">“ ‘ Tis the Vine ! ‘ tis the Vine ! ” said the cup-loving boy</l>

     <l n="4">To witness and hallow its birth .</l>
     <l n="5">The fruit was full grown , like a ruby it flamed</l>
     <l n="6">Till the sunbeam that kist it looked pale ;</l>
     <l n="7">“ ‘ Tis the Vine ! ‘ tis the Vine ! ” every Spirit exclaimed</l>

     <l n="11">In flashes so quick and so brilliant all knew</l>
     <l n="12">T'was the light from his lips as he spoke .</l>
     <l n="13">“ Bright tree ! let thy nectar but cheer me , ” he cried ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ And the fount of Wit never can fail : ”</l>
     <l n="15">“ ‘ Tis the Vine ! ‘ tis the Vine ! ” hills and valleys reply ,</l>

     <l n="20">As made the tree tremble all o'er .</l>
     <l n="21">Oh ! never did flower of the earth , sea , or sky ,</l>
     <l n="22">Such a soul-giving odor inhale :</l>
     <l n="23">“ ‘ Tis the Vine ! ‘ tis the Vine ! ” all re-echo the cry ,</l>

     <l n="25">Last , Joy , without whom even Love and Wit die ,</l>

     <l n="28">When a laugh spoke what Joy could not say ;—</l>
     <l n="29">A laugh of the heart which was echoed around</l>
     <l n="30">Till like music it swelled on the gale :</l>
     <l n="31">“ T is the Vine ! ‘ tis the Vine ! ” laughing myriads resound ,</l>

     <l n="1">Well may you wonder at my flight</l>
     <l n="2">From those fair Gardens in whose bowers</l>
     <l n="3">Lingers whate'er of wise and bright ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of Beauty 's smile or Wisdom 's light ,</l>
     <l n="5">Is left to grace this world of ours .</l>
     <l n="6">Well may my comrades as they roam</l>
     <l n="7">On such sweet eyes as this inquire</l>
     <l n="8">Why I have left that happy home</l>
     <l n="9">Where all is found that all desire ,</l>
     <l n="10">And Time hath wings that never tire :</l>
     <l n="11">Where bliss in all the countless shapes</l>
     <l n="12">That Fancy 's self to bliss hath given</l>
     <l n="13">Comes clustering round like roadside grapes</l>
     <l n="14">That woo the traveller 's lip at even ;</l>
     <l n="15">Where Wisdom flings not joy away —</l>
     <l n="16">As Pallas in the stream they say</l>
     <l n="17">Once flung her flute — but smiling owns</l>
     <l n="18">That woman 's lip can send forth tones</l>
     <l n="19">Worth all the music of those spheres</l>
     <l n="20">So many dream of but none hears ;</l>
     <l n="21">Where Virtue 's self puts on so well</l>
     <l n="22">Her sister Pleasure 's smile that , loath</l>
     <l n="23">From either nymph apart to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="24">We finish by embracing both .</l>

     <l n="28">And by the Nile 's dark flood recline ,</l>
     <l n="29">Fondly , in thought I wing my flight</l>
     <l n="30">Back to those groves and gardens bright ,</l>
     <l n="31">And often think by this sweet light</l>
     <l n="32">How lovelily they all must shine ;</l>
     <l n="33">Can see that graceful temple throw</l>
     <l n="34">Down the green slope its lengthened shade ,</l>
     <l n="35">While on the marble steps below</l>
     <l n="36">There sits some fair Athenian maid ,</l>
     <l n="37">Over some favorite volume bending ;</l>
     <l n="38">And by her side a youthful sage</l>
     <l n="39">Holds back the ringlets that descending</l>
     <l n="40">Would else o'ershadow all the page .</l>
     <l n="41">But hence such thoughts !— nor let me grieve</l>
     <l n="42">O'er scenes of joy that I but leave ,</l>

     <l n="48">I 've floated without pain or care</l>
     <l n="49">Like a light leaf down pleasure 's stream ,</l>
     <l n="50">Caught in each sparkling eddy there ;</l>
     <l n="51">Tho ’ never Mirth awaked a strain</l>
     <l n="52">That my heart echoed not again ;</l>
     <l n="53">Yet have I felt , when even most gay ,</l>
     <l n="54">Sad thoughts — I knew not whence or why —</l>
     <l n="55">Suddenly o'er my spirit fly ,</l>
     <l n="56">Like clouds that ere we 've time to say</l>
     <l n="57">“ How bright the sky is ! ” shade the sky .</l>
     <l n="58">Sometimes so vague , so undefined</l>

     <l n="64">More oft , however , ‘ twas the thought</l>
     <l n="65">How soon that scene with all its play</l>
     <l n="66">Of life and gladness must decay —</l>
     <l n="67">Those lips I prest , the hands I caught —</l>

     <l n="70">This thought it was that came to shed</l>

     <l n="73">Its sadness with my happiest joys .</l>
     <l n="74">Oh , but for this disheartening voice</l>
     <l n="75">Stealing amid our mirth to say</l>
     <l n="76">That all in which we most rejoice</l>
     <l n="77">Ere night may be the earthworm 's prey —</l>
     <l n="78">But for this bitter — only this —</l>
     <l n="79">Full as the world is brimmed with bliss ,</l>
     <l n="80">And capable as feels my soul</l>
     <l n="81">Of draining to its dregs the whole ,</l>

     <l n="90">Of this bright world and wrote her law</l>
     <l n="91">In human hearts was felt and known —</l>
     <l n="92">Not in unreal dreams but true ,</l>
     <l n="93">Substantial joy as pulse e'er knew —</l>

     <l n="116">On one side in the dark blue sky</l>

     <l n="2">‘ Tis true , alas — the mysteries and the lore</l>
     <l n="3">I came to study on this , wondrous shore .</l>
     <l n="4">Are all forgotten in the new delights .</l>
     <l n="5">The strange , wild joys that fill my days and nights .</l>
     <l n="6">Instead of dark , dull oracles that speak</l>
     <l n="7">From subterranean temples , those I seek</l>
     <l n="8">Come from the breathing shrines where Beauty lives ,</l>
     <l n="9">And Love , her priest , the soft responses gives .</l>
     <l n="10">Instead of honoring Isis in those rites</l>
     <l n="11">At Coptos held , I hail her when she lights</l>
     <l n="12">Her first young crescent on the holy stream —</l>
     <l n="13">When wandering youths and maidens watch her beam</l>
     <l n="14">And number o'er the nights she hath to run ,</l>
     <l n="15">Ere she again embrace her bridegroom sun .</l>
     <l n="16">While o'er some mystic leaf that dimly lends</l>
     <l n="17">A clew into past times the student bends ,</l>
     <l n="18">And by its glimmering guidance learns to tread</l>
     <l n="19">Back thro ’ the shadowy knowledge of the dead —</l>
     <l n="20">The only skill , alas , I yet can claim</l>
     <l n="21">Lies in deciphering some new loved-one 's name —</l>
     <l n="22">Some gentle missive hinting time and place ,</l>
     <l n="23">In language soft as Memphian reed can trace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="24">And where — oh where 's the heart that could withstand</l>
     <l n="25">The unnumbered witcheries of this sun-born land ,</l>
     <l n="26">Where first young Pleasure 's banner was unfurled</l>
     <l n="27">And Love hath temples ancient as the world !</l>
     <l n="28">Where mystery like the veil by Beauty worn</l>
     <l n="29">Hides but to win and shades but to adorn ;</l>
     <l n="30">Where that luxurious melancholy born</l>
     <l n="31">Of passion and of genius sheds a gloom</l>
     <l n="32">Making joy holy ;— where the bower and tomb</l>
     <l n="33">Stand side by side and Pleasure learns from Death</l>
     <l n="34">The instant value of each moment 's breath .</l>
     <l n="35">Couldst thou but see how like a poet 's dream</l>
     <l n="36">This lovely land now looks !— the glorious stream</l>
     <l n="37">That late between its banks was seen to glide</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Mong shrines and marble cities on each side</l>
     <l n="39">Glittering like jewels strung along a chain</l>
     <l n="40">Hath now sent forth its waters , and o'er plain</l>
     <l n="41">And valley like a giant from his bed</l>
     <l n="42">Rising with outstretched limbs hath grandly spread .</l>
     <l n="43">While far as sight can reach beneath as clear</l>
     <l n="44">And blue a heaven as ever blest our sphere ,</l>
     <l n="45">Gardens and pillared streets and porphyry domes</l>
     <l n="46">And high-built temples fit to be the homes</l>
     <l n="47">Of mighty Gods , and pyramids whose hour</l>
     <l n="48">Outlasts all time above the waters tower !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">Then , too , the scenes of pomp and joy that make</l>

     <l n="51">Where all that Love , Religion , Commerce gives</l>
     <l n="52">Of life and motion ever moves and lives .</l>
     <l n="53">Here , up the steps of temples from the wave</l>
     <l n="54">Ascending in procession slow and grave .</l>
     <l n="55">Priests in white garments go , with sacred wands</l>
     <l n="56">And silver cymbals gleaming in their hands ;</l>
     <l n="57">While there , rich barks — fresh from those sunny tracts</l>
     <l n="58">Far off beyond the sounding cataracts —</l>
     <l n="59">Glide with their precious lading to the sea ,</l>
     <l n="60">Plumes of bright birds , rhinoceros ivory ,</l>
     <l n="61">Gems from the Isle of Meroe , and those grains</l>
     <l n="62">Of gold washed down by Abyssinian rains .</l>
     <l n="63">Here where the waters wind into a bay</l>
     <l n="64">Shadowy and cool some pilgrims on their way</l>
     <l n="65">To Saïs or Bubastus among beds</l>
     <l n="66">Of lotus flowers that close above their heads</l>
     <l n="67">Push their light barks , and there as in a bower ,</l>
     <l n="68">Sing , talk , or sleep away the sultry hour ;</l>
     <l n="69">Oft dipping in the Nile , when faint with heat ,</l>
     <l n="70">That leaf from which its waters drink most sweet .—</l>
     <l n="71">While haply not far off beneath a bank</l>
     <l n="72">Of blossoming acacias many a prank</l>
     <l n="73">Is played in the cool current by a train</l>
     <l n="74">Of laughing nymphs , lovely as she ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>whose chain</l>
     <l n="75">Around two conquerors of the world was cast ,</l>
     <l n="76">But , for a third too feeble , broke at last .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="77">For oh ! believe not them who dare to brand</l>
     <l n="78">As poor in charms the women of this land .</l>

     <l n="80">Thro ’ every vein and tinges as it goes ,</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tis but the embrowning of the fruit that tells</l>
     <l n="82">How rich within the soul of ripeness dwells —</l>
     <l n="83">The hue their own dark sanctuaries wear ,</l>
     <l n="84">Announcing heaven in half-caught glimpses there .</l>
     <l n="85">And never yet did tell-tale looks set free</l>
     <l n="86">The secret of young hearts more tenderly .</l>
     <l n="87">Such eyes !— long , shadowy , with that languid fall</l>
     <l n="88">Of the fringed lids which may be seen in all</l>
     <l n="89">Who live beneath the sun 's too ardent rays —</l>
     <l n="90">Lending such looks as on their marriage days</l>
     <l n="91">Young maids cast down before a bridegroom 's gaze !</l>
     <l n="92">Then for their grace — mark but the nymph-like shapes</l>
     <l n="93">Of the young village girls , when carrying grapes</l>
     <l n="94">From green Anthylla or light urns of flowers —</l>
     <l n="95">Not our own Sculpture in her happiest hours</l>
     <l n="96">E'er imaged forth even at the touch of him<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
     <l n="97">Whose touch was life , more luxury of limb !</l>
     <l n="98">Then , canst thou wonder if mid scenes like these</l>
     <l n="99">I should forget all graver mysteries ,</l>
     <l n="100">All lore but Love 's , all secrets but that best</l>
     <l n="101">In heaven or earth , the art of being blest !</l>
     <l n="102">Yet are there times — tho ’ brief I own their stay ,</l>
     <l n="103">Like summer-clouds that shine themselves away —</l>
     <l n="104">Moments of gloom , when even these pleasures pall</l>
     <l n="105">Upon my saddening heart and I recall</l>
     <l n="106">That garden dream — that promise of a power ,</l>
     <l n="107">Oh , were there such !— to lengthen out life 's hour ,</l>

     <l n="109">Opening before us into endless day !</l>
     <l n="110">And chiefly o'er my spirit did this thought</l>
     <l n="111">Come on that evening — bright as ever brought</l>
     <l n="112">Light 's golden farewell to the world — when first</l>
     <l n="113">The eternal pyramids of Memphis burst</l>
     <l n="114">Awfully on my sight-standing sublime</l>
     <l n="115">Twixt earth and heaven , the watch-towers of Time ,</l>
     <l n="116">From whose lone summit when his reign hath past</l>

     <l n="118">There hung a calm and solemn sunshine round</l>

     <l n="121">Like music of past times into my soul .</l>

   <p>LALLA ROOKH</p>
   <p>TO</p>
   <p>SAMUEL ROGERS , ESQ .</p>
   <p>THIS EASTERN ROMANCE</p>
   <p>IS INSCRIBED</p>
   <p>BY</p>
   <p>HIS VERY GRATEFUL AND AFFECTIONATE FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>THOMAS MOORE .</p>
   <p>LALLA ROOKH</p>
   <p>In the eleventh year of the reign of Aurungzebe , Abdalla , King of the Lesser Bucharia , a lineal descendant from the Great Zingis , having abdicated the throne in favor of his son , set out on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Prophet ; and , passing into India through the delightful valley of Cashmere , rested for a short time at Delhi on his way . He was entertained by Aurungzebe in a style of magnificent hospitality , worthy alike of the visitor and the host , and was afterwards escorted with the same splendor to Surat , where he embarked for Arabia .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>During the stay of the Royal Pilgrim at Delhi , a marriage was agreed upon between the Prince , his son , and the youngest daughter of the Emperor , LALLA ROOKH ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>— a Princess described by the poets of her time as more beautiful than Leila ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Shirine ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Dewildé ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>or any of those heroines whose names and loves embellish the songs of Persia and Hindostan . It was intended that the nuptials should be celebrated at Cashmere ; where the young King , as soon as the cares of the empire would permit , was to meet , for the first time , his lovely bride , and , after a few months ’ repose in that enchanting valley , conduct her over the snowy hills into Bucharia .</p>
   <p>The day of LALLA ROOKH 'S departure from Delhi was as splendid as sunshine and pageantry could make it . The bazaars and baths were all covered with the richest tapestry ; hundreds of gilded barges upon the Jumna floated with their banners shining in the water ; while through the streets groups of beautiful children went strewing the most delicious flowers around , as in that Persian festival called the Scattering of the Roses ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>till every part of the city was as fragrant as if a caravan of musk from Khoten had passed through it . The Princess , having taken leave of her kind father , who at parting hung a cornelian of Yemen round her neck , on which was inscribed a verse from the Koran , and having sent a considerable present to the Fakirs , who kept up the Perpetual Lamp in her sister 's tomb , meekly ascended the palankeen prepared for her ; and while Aurungzebe stood to take a last look from his balcony , the procession moved slowly on the road to Lahore .</p>
   <p>Seldom had the Eastern world seen a cavalcade so superb . From the gardens in the suburbs to the Imperial palace , it was one unbroken line of splendor . The gallant appearance of the Rajahs and Mogul lords , distinguished by those insignia of the Emperor 's favor ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>the feathers of the egret of Cashmere in their turbans , and the small silver-rimm 'd kettle-drums at the bows of their saddles ;— the costly armor of their cavaliers , who vied , on this occasion , with the guards of the great Keder Khan ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>in the brightness of their silver battle-axes and the massiness of their maces of gold ;— the glittering of the gilt pine-apple<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>on the tops of the palankeens ;— the embroidered trappings of the elephants , bearing on their backs small turrets , in the shape of little antique temples , within which the Ladies of LALLA ROOKH lay as it were enshrined ; — the rose-colored veils of the Princess 's own sumptuous litter ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>at the front of which a fair young female slave sat fanning her through the curtains , with feathers of the Argus pheasant 's wing ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>— and the lovely troop of Tartarian and Cashmerian maids of honor , whom the young King had sent to accompany his bride , and who rode on each side of the litter , upon small Arabian horses ;— all was brilliant , tasteful , and magnificent , and pleased even the critical and fastidious FADLADEEN , Great Nazir or Chamberlain of the Haram , who was borne in his palankeen immediately after the Princess , and considered himself not the least important personage of the pageant .</p>
   <p>FADLADEEN was a judge of everything ,— from the pencilling of a Circassian 's eyelids to the deepest questions of science and literature ; from the mixture of a conserve of rose-leaves to the composition of an epic poem : and such influence had his opinion upon the various tastes of the day , that all the cooks and poets of Delhi stood in awe of him . His political conduct and opinions were founded upon that line of Sadi ,— “ Should the Prince at noon-day say , It is night , declare that you behold the moon and stars . ” — And his zeal for religion , of which Aurungzebe was a munificent protector ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>was about as disinterested as that of the goldsmith who fell in love with the diamond eyes of the idol of Jaghernaut .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span></p>
   <p>During the first days of their journey , LALLA ROOKH , who had passed all her life within the shadow of the Royal Gardens of Delhi ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>found enough in the beauty of the scenery through which they passed to interest her mind , and delight her imagination ; and when at evening or in the heat of the day they turned off from the high road to those retired and romantic places which had been selected for her encampments ,— sometimes , on the banks of a small rivulet , as clear as the waters of the Lake of Pearl ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>sometimes under the sacred shade of a Banyan tree , from which the view opened upon a glade covered with antelopes ; and often in those hidden , embowered spots , described by one from the Isles of the West ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>as “ places of melancholy , delight , and safety , where all the company around was wild peacocks and turtle-doves ; ” — she felt a charm in these scenes , so lovely and so new to her , which , for a time , made her indifferent to every other amusement . But LALLA ROOKH was young , and the young love variety ; nor could the conversation of her Ladies and the Great Chamberlain , FADLADEEN , ( the only persons , of course , admitted to her pavilion . ) sufficiently enliven those many vacant hours , which were devoted neither to the pillow nor the palankeen . There was a little Persian slave who sung sweetly to the Vina , and who , now and then , lulled the Princess to sleep with the ancient ditties of her country , about the loves of Wavnak and Ezra ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>the fair-haired Zal and his mistress Rodahver ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>not forgetting the combat of Rustam with the terrible White Demon .<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>At other times she was amused by those graceful dancing-girls of Delhi , who had been permitted by the Bramins of the Great Pagoda to attend her , much to the horror of the good Mussulman FADLADEEN , who could see nothing graceful or agreeable in idolaters , and to whom the very tinkling of their golden anklets<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>was an abomination .</p>
   <p>But these and many other diversions were repeated till they lost all their charm , and the nights and noon-days were beginning to move heavily , when , at length , it was recollected that , among the attendants sent by the bridegroom , was a young poet of Cashmere , much celebrated throughout the Valley for his manner of reciting the Stories of the East , on whom his Royal Master had conferred the privilege of being admitted to the pavilion of the Princess , that he might help to beguile the tediousness of the journey by some of his most agreeable recitals . At the mention of a poet , FADLADEEN elevated his critical eyebrows , and , having refreshed his faculties with a dose of that delicious opium which is distilled from the black poppy of the Thebais , gave orders for the minstrel to be forthwith introduced into the presence .</p>
   <p>The Princess , who had once in her life seen a poet from behind the screens of gauze in her father 's hall , and had conceived from that specimen no very favorable ideas of the Caste , expected but little in this new exhibition to interest her ;— she felt inclined , however , to alter her opinion on the very first appearance of FERAMORZ . He was a youth about LALLA ROOKH 'S own age , and graceful as that idol of women , Crishna ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>— such as he appears to their young imaginations , heroic , beautiful , breathing music from his very eyes , and exalting the religion of his worshippers into love . His dress was simple , yet not without some marks of costliness ; and the Ladies of the Princess were not long in discovering that the cloth , which encircled his high Tartarian cap , was of the most delicate kind that the shawl-goats of Tibet supply .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>Here and there , too , over his vest , which was confined by a flowered girdle of Kashan , hung strings of fine pearl , disposed with an air of studied negligence ;— nor did the exquisite embroidery of his sandals escape the observation of these fair critics ; who , however they might give way to FADLADEEN upon the unimportant topics of religion and government , had the spirit of martyrs in everything relating to such momentous matters as jewels and embroidery .</p>
   <p>For the purpose of relieving the pauses of recitation by music , the young Cashmerian held in his hand a kitar ;— such as , in old times , the Arab maids of the West used to listen to by moonlight in the gardens of the Alhambra — and , having premised , with much humility , that the story he was about to relate was founded on the adventures of that Veiled Prophet of Khorassan ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>who , in the year of the Hegira 163 , created such alarm throughout the Eastern Empire , made an obeisance to the Princess , and thus began :—</p>

   <p>On their arrival next night at the place of encampment they were surprised and delighted to find the groves all around illuminated ; some artists of Yamtcheou<span type="note_anchor">[ 53 ]</span>having been sent on previously for the purpose . On each side of the green alley , which led to the Royal Pavilion , artificial sceneries of bamboo-work were erected , representing arches , minarets , towers , from which hung thousands of silken lanterns painted by the most delicate pencils of Canton .— Nothing could be more beautiful than the leaves of the mango-trees and acacias shining in the light of the bamboo-scenery which shed a lustre round as soft as that of the nights of Peristan .</p>

   <p>LALLA ROOKH could think of nothing all day but the misery of those two young lovers . Her gayety was gone , and she looked pensively even upon FADLAPEEN . She felt , too , without knowing why , a sort of uneasy pleasure in imagining that AZIM must have been just such a youth as FERAMORZ ; just as worthy to enjoy all the blessings , without any of the pangs , of that illusive passion , which too often like the sunny apples of Istkahar<span type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span>is all sweetness on one side and all bitterness on the other .</p>
   <p>As they passed along a sequestered river after sunset they saw a young Hindoo girl upon the bank , whose employment seemed to them so strange that they stopped their palankeens to observe her . She had lighted a small lamp filled with oil of cocoa , and placing it in an earthen dish adorned with a wreath of flowers , had committed it with a trembling hand to the stream ; and was now anxiously watching its progress down the current , heedless of the gay cavalcade which had drawn up beside her . LALLA ROOKH was all curiosity ;— when one of her attendants , who had lived upon the banks of the Ganges , ( where this ceremony is so frequent that often in the dusk of the evening the river is seen glittering all over with lights , like the Oton-tala or Sea of Stars ,)[ 89 ] informed the princess that it was the usual way in which the friends of those who had gone on dangerous voyages offered up vows for their safe return . If the lamp sunk immediately the omen was disastrous ; but if it went shining down the stream and continued to burn till entirely out of sight , the return of the beloved object was considered as certain .</p>
   <p>LALLA ROOKH as they moved on more than once looked back to observe how the young Hindoo 's lamp proceeded ; and while she saw with pleasure that it was still unextinguished she could not help fearing that all the hopes of this life were no better than that feeble light upon the river . The remainder of the journey was passed in silence . She now for the first time felt that shade of melancholy which comes over the youthful maiden 's heart as sweet and transient as her own breath upon a mirror ; nor was it till she heard the lute of FERAMOKZ , touched lightly at the door of her pavilion that she waked from the revery in which she had been wandering . Instantly her eyes were lighted up with pleasure ; and after a few unheard remarks from FADLADEEN upon the indecorum of a poet seating himself in presence of a Princess everything was arranged as on the preceding evening and all listened with eagerness while the story was thus continued :—</p>

   <p>The story of the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan being ended , they were now doomed to hear FADLADEEN 'S criticisms upon it . A series of disappointments and accidents had occurred to this learned Chamberlain during the journey . In the first place , those couriers stationed , as in the reign of Shah Jehan , between Delhi and the Western coast of India , to secure a constant supply of mangoes for the Royal Table , had by some cruel irregularity failed in their duty ; and to eat any mangoes but those of Mazagong was of course impossible .<span type="note_anchor">[ 136 ]</span>In the next place , the elephant laden with his fine antique porcelain ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 137 ]</span>had , in an unusual fit of liveliness , shattered the whole set to pieces :— an irreparable loss , as many of the vessels were so exquisitely old , as to have been used under the Emperors Yan and Chun , who reigned many ages before the dynasty of Tang . His Koran too , supposed to be the identical copy between the leaves of which Mahomet 's favorite pigeon used to nestle , had been mislaid by his Koran-bearer three whole days ; not without much spiritual alarm to FADLADEEN who though professing to hold with other loyal and orthodox Mussulmans that salvation could only be found in the Koran was strongly suspected of believing in his heart that it could only be found in his own particular copy of it . When to all these grievances is added the obstinacy of the cooks in putting the pepper of Canara into his dishes instead of the cinnamon of Serendib , we may easily suppose that he came to the task of criticism with at least a sufficient degree of irritability for the purpose .</p>
   <p>“ In order , ” said he , importantly swinging about his chaplet of pearls , “ to convey with clearness my opinion of the story this young man has related , it is necessary to take a review of all the stories that have ever ” — -  “ My good FADLADEEN ! ” exclaimed the Princess , interrupting him , “ we really do not deserve that you should give yourself so much trouble . Your opinion of the poem we have just heard , will I have no doubt be abundantly edifying without any further waste of your valuable erudition . ” — “ If that be all , ” replied the critic ,— evidently mortified at not being allowed to show how much he knew about everything but the subject immediately before him — “ if that be all that is required the matter is easily despatched . ” He then proceeded to analyze the poem , in that strain ( so well known to the unfortunate bards of Delhi ) , whose censures were an infliction from which few recovered and whose very praises were like the honey extracted from the bitter flowers of the aloe . The chief personages of the story were , if he rightly understood them , an ill-favored gentleman with a veil over his face ;— a young lady whose reason went and came according as it suited the poet 's convenience to be sensible or otherwise ;— and a youth in one of those hideous Bokharian bonnets , who took the aforesaid gentleman in a veil for a Divinity . “ From such materials , ” said he , “ what can be expected ?— after rivalling each other in long speeches and absurdities through some thousands of lines as indigestible as the filberts of Berdaa , our friend in the veil jumps into a tub of aquafortis ; the young lady dies in a set speech whose only recommendation is that it is her last ; and the lover lives on to a good old age for the laudable purpose of seeing her ghost which he at last happily accomplishes , and expires . This you will allow is a fair summary of the story ; and if Nasser , the Arabian merchant , told no better , our Holy Prophet ( to whom be all honor and glory ! ) had no need to be jealous of his abilities for story-telling . ”</p>
   <p>With respect to the style , it was worthy of the matter ;— it had not even those politic contrivances of structure which make up for the commonness of the thoughts by the peculiarity of the manner nor that stately poetical phraseology by which sentiments mean in themselves , like the blacksmith 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 138 ]</span>apron converted into a banner , are so easily gilt and embroidered into consequence . Then as to the versification it was , to say no worse of it , execrable : it had neither the copious flow of Ferdosi , the sweetness of Hafez , nor the sententious march of Sadi ; but appeared to him in the uneasy heaviness of its movements to have been modelled upon the gait of a very tired dromedary . The licenses too in which it indulged were unpardonable ;— for instance this line , and the poem abounded with such ;—</p>
   <p>Like the faint , exquisite music of a dream .</p>
   <p>“ What critic that can count , ” said FADLADEEN , “ and has his full complement of fingers to count withal , would tolerate for an instant such syllabic superfluities ? ” — He here looked round , and discovered that most of his audience were asleep ; while the glimmering lamps seemed inclined to follow their example . It became necessary therefore , however painful to himself , to put an end to his valuable animadversions for the present and he accordingly concluded with an air of dignified candor , thus :—</p>
   <p>“ Notwithstanding the observations which I have thought it my duty to make , it is by no means my wish to discourage the young man :— so far from it indeed that if he will but totally alter his style of writing and thinking I have very little doubt that I shall be vastly pleased with him . ”</p>
   <p>Some days elapsed after this harangue of the Great Chamberlain before LALLA ROOKH could venture to ask for another story . The youth was still a welcome guest in the pavilion — to one heart perhaps too dangerously welcome ;— but all mention of poetry was as if by common consent avoided . Though none of the party had much respect for FADLADEEN , yet his censures thus magisterially delivered evidently made an impression on them all . The Poet himself to whom criticism was quite a new operation , ( being wholly unknown in that Paradise of the Indies , Cashmere ,) felt the shock as it is generally felt at first , till use has made it more tolerable to the patient ;— the Ladies began to suspect that they ought not to be pleased and seemed to conclude that there must have been much good sense in what FADLADEEN said from its having set them all so soundly to sleep ;— while the self-complacent Chamberlain was left to triumph in the idea of having for the hundred and fiftieth time in his life extinguished a Poet . LALLA ROOKH alone — and Love knew why — persisted in being delighted with all she had heard and in resolving to hear more as speedily as possible . Her manner however of first returning to the subject was unlucky . It was while they rested during the heat of noon near a fountain on which some hand had rudely traced those well-known words from the Garden of Sadi .— “ Many like me have viewed this fountain , but they are gone and their eyes are closed for ever ! ” — that she took occasion from the melancholy beauty of this passage to dwell upon the charms of poetry in general . “ It is true , ” she said , “ few poets can imitate that sublime bird which flies always in the air and never touches the earth :[ 139 ] — it is only once in many ages a Genius appears whose words , like those on the Written Mountain last for ever :[ 140 ] — but still there are some as delightful perhaps , though not so wonderful , who if not stars over our head are at least flowers along our path and whose sweetness of the moment we ought gratefully to inhale without calling upon them for a brightness and a durability beyond their nature . In short , ” continued she , blushing as if conscious of being caught in an oration , “ it is quite cruel that a poet cannot wander through his regions of enchantment without having a critic for ever , like the old Man of the Sea , upon his back ! "[ 141 ] — FADLADEEN , it was plain took this last luckless allusion to himself and would treasure it up in his mind as a whetstone for his next criticism . A sudden silence ensued ; and the Princess , glancing a look at FERAMORZ , saw plainly she must wait for a more courageous moment .</p>
   <p>But the glories of Nature and her wild , fragrant airs playing freshly over the current of youthful spirits will soon heal even deeper wounds than the dull Fadladeens of this world can inflict . In an evening or two after , they came to the small Valley of Gardens which had been planted by order of the Emperor for his favorite sister Rochinara during their progress to Cashmere some years before ; and never was there a more sparkling assemblage of sweets since the Gulzar-e-Irem or Rose-bower of Irem . Every precious flower was there to be found that poetry or love or religion has ever consecrated ; from the dark hyacinth to which Hafez compares his mistress 's hair to be Cámalatá by whose rosy blossoms the heaven of Indra is scented .<span type="note_anchor">[ 142 ]</span>As they sat in the cool fragrance of this delicious spot and LALLA ROOKH remarked that she could fancy it the abode of that flower-loving Nymph whom they worship in the temples of Kathay ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 143 ]</span>or of one of those Peris , those beautiful creatures of the air who live upon perfumes and to whom a place like this might make some amends for the Paradise they have lost ,— the young Poet in whose eyes she appeared while she spoke to be one of the bright spiritual creatures she was describing said hesitatingly that he remembered a Story of a Peri , which if the Princess had no objection he would venture to relate . “ It is , ” said he , with an appealing look to FADLADEEN , “ in a lighter and humbler strain than the other : ” then , striking a few careless but melancholy chords on his kitar , he thus began :—</p>

   <p>“ And this , ” said the Great Chamberlain , “ is poetry ! this flimsy manufacture of the brain , which in comparison with the lofty and durable monuments of genius is as the gold filigree-work of Zamara beside the eternal architecture of Egypt ! ” After this gorgeous sentence , which , with a few more of the same kind , FADLADEEN kept by him for rare and important occasions , he proceeded to the anatomy of the short poem just recited . The lax and easy kind of metre in which it was written ought to be denounced , he said , as one of the leading causes of the alarming growth of poetry in our times . If some check were not given to this lawless facility we should soon be overrun by a race of bards as numerous and as shallow as the hundred and twenty thousand Streams of Basra .<span type="note_anchor">[ 179 ]</span>They who succeeded in this style deserved chastisement for their very success ;— as warriors have been punished even after gaining a victory because they had taken the liberty of gaining it in an irregular or unestablished manner . What then was to be said to those who failed ? to those who presumed as in the present lamentable instance to imitate the licence and ease of the bolder sons of song without any of that grace or vigor which gave a dignity even to negligence ;— who like them flung the jereed<span type="note_anchor">[ 180 ]</span>carelessly , but not , like them , to the mark ;— “ and who , ” said he , raising his voice to excite a proper degree of wakefulness in his hearers , “ contrive to appear heavy and constrained in the midst of all the latitude they allow themselves , like one of those young pagans that dance before the Princess , who is ingenious enough to move as if her limbs were fettered , in a pair of the lightest and loosest drawers of Masulipatam ! ”</p>
   <p>It was but little suitable , he continued , to the grave march of criticism to follow this fantastical Peri of whom they had just heard , through all her flights and adventures between earth and heaven , but he could not help adverting to the puerile conceitedness of the Three Gifts which she is supposed to carry to the skies ,— a drop of blood , forsooth , a sigh , and a tear ! How the first of these articles was delivered into the Angel 's “ radiant hand ” he professed himself at a loss to discover ; and as to the safe carriage of the sigh and the tear , such Peris and such poets were beings by far too incomprehensible for him even to guess how they managed such matters . “ But , in short , ” said he , “ it is a waste of time and patience to dwell longer upon a thing so incurably frivolous ,— puny even among its own puny race , and such as only the Banyan Hospital<span type="note_anchor">[ 181 ]</span>for Sick Insects should undertake . ”</p>
   <p>In vain did LALLA ROOKH try to soften this inexorable critic ; in vain did she resort to her most eloquent commonplaces , reminding him that poets were a timid and sensitive race whose sweetness was not to be drawn forth like that of the fragrant grass near the Ganges by crushing and trampling upon them ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 182 ]</span>that severity often extinguished every chance of the perfection which it demanded , and that after all perfection was like the Mountain of the Talisman ,— no one had ever yet reached its summit .<span type="note_anchor">[ 183 ]</span>Neither these gentle axioms nor the still gentler looks with which they were inculcated could lower for one instant the elevation of FADLADEEN 'S eyebrows or charm him into anything like encouragement or even toleration of her poet . Toleration , indeed , was not among the weaknesses of FADLADEEN :— he carried the same spirit into matters of poetry and of religion , and though little versed in the beauties or sublimities of either was a perfect master of the art of persecution in both . His zeal was the same too in either pursuit , whether the game before him was pagans or poetasters , worshippers of cows , or writers of epics .</p>
   <p>They had now arrived at the splendid city of Lahore whose mausoleums and shrines , magnificent and numberless where Death appeared to share equal honors with Heaven would have powerfully affected the heart and imagination of LALLA ROOKH , if feelings more of this earth had not taken entire possession of her already . She was here met by messengers despatched from Cashmere who informed her that the King had arrived in the Valley and was himself superintending the sumptuous preparations that were then making in the Saloons of the Shalimar for her reception . The chill she felt on receiving this intelligence ,— which to a bride whose heart was free and light would have brought only images of affection and pleasure ,— convinced her that her peace was gone for ever and that she was in love , irretrievably in love , with young FERAMORZ . The veil had fallen off in which this passion at first disguises itself , and to know that she loved was now as painful as to love without knowing it had been delicious . FERAMORZ , too ,— what misery would be his , if the sweet hours of intercourse so imprudently allowed them should have stolen into his heart the same fatal fascination as into hers ;— if , notwithstanding her rank and the modest homage he always paid to it , even he should have yielded to the influence of those long and happy interviews where music , poetry , the delightful scenes of nature ,— all had tended to bring their hearts close together and to waken by every means that too ready passion which often like the young of the desert-bird is warmed into life by the eyes alone !<span type="note_anchor">[ 184 ]</span>She saw but one way to preserve herself from being culpable as well as unhappy , and this however painful she was resolved to adopt . FERAMORZ must no more be admitted to her presence . To have strayed so far into the dangerous labyrinth was wrong , but to linger in it while the clew was yet in her hand would be criminal . Though the heart she had to offer to the King of Bucharia might be cold and broken , it should at least be pure , and she must only endeavor to forget the short dream of happiness she had enjoyed ,— like that Arabian shepherd who in wandering into the wilderness caught a glimpse of the Gardens of Irim and then lost them again for ever !</p>
   <p>The arrival of the young Bride at Lahore was celebrated in the most enthusiastic manner . The Rajas and Omras in her train , who had kept at a certain distance during the journey and never encamped nearer to the Princess than was strictly necessary for her safeguard here rode in splendid cavalcade through the city and distributed the most costly presents to the crowd . Engines were erected in all the squares which cast forth showers of confectionery among the people , while the artisans in chariots<span type="note_anchor">[ 185 ]</span>adorned with tinsel and flying streamers exhibited the badges of their respective trades through the streets . Such brilliant displays of life and pageantry among the palaces and domes and gilded minarets of Lahore made the city altogether like a place of enchantment ;— particularly on the day when LALLA ROOKH set out again upon her journey , when she was accompanied to the gate by all the fairest and richest of the nobility and rode along between ranks of beautiful boys and girls who kept waving over their heads plates of gold and silver flowers ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 186 ]</span>and then threw them around to be gathered by the populace .</p>
   <p>For many days after their departure from Lahore a considerable degree of gloom hung over the whole party . LALLA ROOKH , who had intended to make illness her excuse for not admitting the young minstrel , as usual , to the pavilion , soon found that to feign indisposition was unnecessary ;— FADLADEEN felt the loss of the good road they had hitherto travelled and was very near cursing Jehan-Guire ( of blessed memory ! ) for not having continued his delectable alley of trees<span type="note_anchor">[ 187 ]</span>a least as far as the mountains of Cashmere ;— while the Ladies who had nothing now to do all day but to be fanned by peacocks ’ feathers and listen to FADLADEEN seemed heartily weary of the life they led and in spite of all the Great Chamberlain 's criticisms were so tasteless as to wish for the poet again . One evening as they were proceeding to their place of rest for the night the Princess who for the freer enjoyment of the air had mounted her favorite Arabian palfrey , in passing by a small grove heard the notes of a lute from within its leaves and a voice which she but too well knew singing the following words :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Tell me not of joys above ,</l>
     <l n="2">If that world can give no bliss ,</l>
     <l n="3">Truer , happier than the Love</l>
     <l n="4">Which enslaves our souls in this .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">Tell me not of Houris ’ eyes ;—</l>
     <l n="6">Far from me their dangerous glow .</l>
     <l n="7">If those looks that light the skies</l>
     <l n="8">Wound like some that burn below .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">Who that feels what Love is here ,</l>
     <l n="10">All its falsehood — all its pain —</l>
     <l n="11">Would , for even Elysium 's sphere ,</l>
     <l n="12">Risk the fatal dream again ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Who that midst a desert 's heat</l>
     <l n="14">Sees the waters fade away</l>
     <l n="15">Would not rather die than meet</l>
     <l n="16">Streams again as false as they ?</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The tone of melancholy defiance in which these words were uttered went to LALLA ROOKH 'S heart ;— and as she reluctantly rode on she could not help feeling it to be a sad but still sweet certainty that FERAMORZ was to the full as enamored and miserable as herself .</p>
   <p>The place where they encamped that evening was the first delightful spot they had come to since they left Lahore . On one side of them was a grove full of small Hindoo temples and planted with the most graceful trees of the East , where the tamarind , the cassia , and the silken plantains of Ceylon were mingled in rich contrast with the high fan-like foliage of the Palmyra ,— that favorite tree of the luxurious bird that lights up the chambers of its nest with fire-flies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 188 ]</span>. In the middle of the lawn where the pavilion stood there was a tank surrounded by small mango-trees on the clear cold waters of which floated multitudes of the beautiful red lotus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 189 ]</span>while at a distance stood the ruins of a strange and awful - looking tower which seemed old enough to have been the temple of some religion no longer known and which spoke the voice of desolation in the midst of all that bloom and loveliness . This singular ruin excited the wonder and conjectures of all . LALLA ROOKH guessed in vain , and the all - pretending FADLADEEN who had never till this journey been beyond the precincts of Delhi was proceeding most learnedly to show that he knew nothing whatever about the matter , when one of the Ladies suggested that perhaps FERAMORZ could satisfy their curiosity . They were now approaching his native mountains and this tower might perhaps be a relic of some of those dark superstitions which had prevailed in that country before the light of Islam dawned upon it . The Chamberlain who usually preferred his own ignorance to the best knowledge that any one else could give him was by no means pleased with this officious reference , and the Princess too was about to interpose a faint word of objection , but before either of them could speak a slave was despatched for FERAMORZ , who in a very few minutes made his appearance before them — looking so pale and unhappy in LALLA ROOKH 'S eyes that she repented already of her cruelty in having so long excluded him .</p>
   <p>That venerable tower he told them was the remains of an ancient Fire - Temple , built by those Ghebers or Persians of the old religion , who many hundred years since had fled hither from the Arab conquerors , preferring liberty and their altars in a foreign land to the alternative of apostasy or persecution in their own . It was impossible , he added , not to feel interested in the many glorious but unsuccessful struggles which had been made by these original natives of Persia to cast off the yoke of their bigoted conquerors . Like their own Fire in the Burning Field at Bakou when suppressed in one place they had but broken out with fresh flame in another ; and as a native of Cashmere , of that fair and Holy Valley which had in the same manner become the prey of strangers<span type="note_anchor">[ 190 ]</span>and seen her ancient shrines and native princes swept away before the march of her intolerant invaders he felt a sympathy , he owned , with the sufferings of the persecuted Ghebers which every monument like this before them but tended more powerfully to awaken .</p>
   <p>It was the first time that FERAMORZ had ever ventured upon so much prose before FADLADEEN and it may easily be conceived what effect such prose as this must have produced upon that most orthodox and most pagan - hating personage . He sat for some minutes aghast , ejaculating only at intervals , “ Bigoted conquerors !— sympathy with Fire-worshippers ! "[ 191 ] — while FERAMORZ happy to take advantage of this almost speechless horror of the Chamberlain proceeded to say that he knew a melancholy story connected with the events of one of those struggles of the brave Fire-worshippers against their Arab masters , which if the evening was not too far advanced he should have much pleasure in being allowed to relate to the Princess . It was impossible for LALLA ROOKH to refuse ;— he had never before looked half so animated , and when he spoke of the Holy Valley his eyes had sparkled she thought like the talismanic characters on the scimitar of Solomon . Her consent was therefore most readily granted ; and while FADLADEEN sat in unspeakable dismay , expecting treason and abomination in every line , the poet thus began his story of the Fire-worshippers :</p>

   <p>The Princess whose heart was sad enough already could have wished that FERAMORZ had chosen a less melancholy story ; as it is only to the happy that tears are a luxury . Her Ladies however were by no means sorry that love was once more the Poet 's theme ; for , whenever he spoke of love , they said , his voice was as sweet as if he had chewed the leaves of that enchanted tree , which grows over the tomb of the musician , Tan-Sein .<span type="note_anchor">[ 212 ]</span></p>
   <p>Their road all the morning had lain through a very dreary country ;— through valleys , covered with a low bushy jungle , where in more than one place the awful signal of the bamboo staff<span type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span>with the white flag at its top reminded the traveller that in that very spot the tiger had made some human creature his victim . It was therefore with much pleasure that they arrived at sunset in a safe and lovely glen and encamped under one of those holy trees whose smooth columns and spreading roofs seem to destine them for natural temples of religion . Beneath this spacious shade some pious hands had erected a row of pillars ornamented with the most beautiful porcelain<span type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span>which now supplied the use of mirrors to the young maidens as they adjusted their hair in descending from the palankeens . Here while as usual the Princess sat listening anxiously with FADLADEEN in one of his loftiest moods of criticism by her side the young Poet leaning against a branch of the tree thus continued his story :—</p>

   <p>LALLA ROOKH had the night before been visited by a dream which in spite of the impending fate of poor HAFED made her heart more than usually cheerful during the morning and gave her cheeks all the freshened animation of a flower that the Bidmusk had just passed over .<span type="note_anchor">[ 240 ]</span>She fancied that she was sailing on that Eastern Ocean where the sea-gypsies who live for ever on the water<span type="note_anchor">[ 241 ]</span>enjoy a perpetual summer in wandering from isle to isle when she saw a small gilded bark approaching her . It was like one of those boats which the Maldivian islanders send adrift , at the mercy of winds and waves , loaded with perfumes , flowers , and odoriferous wood , as an offering to the Spirit whom they call King of the Sea . At first , this little bark appeared to be empty but on coming nearer —</p>
   <p>She had proceeded thus far in relating the dream to her Ladies , when FERAMORZ appeared at the door of the pavilion . In his presence of course everything else was forgotten and the continuance of the story was instantly requested by all . Fresh wood of aloes was set to burn in the cassolets ;— the violet sherbets<span type="note_anchor">[ 242 ]</span>were hastily handed round , and after a short prelude on his lute in the pathetic measure of Nava ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 243 ]</span>which is always used to express the lamentations of absent lovers , the Poet thus continued :—</p>

   <p>The next evening LALLA ROOKH was entreated by her Ladies to continue the relation of her wonderful dream ; but the fearful interest that hung round the fate of HINDA and her lover had completely removed every trace of it from her mind ;— much to the disappointment of a fair seer or two in her train , who prided themselves on their skill in interpreting visions , and who had already remarked , as an unlucky omen , that the Princess , on the very morning after the dream , had worn a silk dyed with the blossoms of the sorrowful tree , Nilica .<span type="note_anchor">[ 255 ]</span></p>
   <p>FADLADEEN , whose indignation had more than once broken out during the recital of some parts of this heterodox poem , seemed at length to have made up his mind to the infliction ; and took his seat this evening with all the patience of a martyr while the Poet resumed his profane and seditious story as follows :—</p>

     <l n="9">And a moist radiance from the skies</l>
     <l n="10">Shoots trembling down , as from the eyes</l>
     <l n="11">Of some meek penitent whose last</l>
     <l n="12">Bright hours atone for dark ones past ,</l>

   <p>The singular placidity with which FADLADEEN had listened during the latter part of this obnoxious story surprised the Princess and FERAMORZ exceedingly ; and even inclined towards him the hearts of these unsuspicious young persons who little knew the source of a complacency so marvellous . The truth was he had been organizing for the last few days a most notable plan of persecution against the poet in consequence of some passages that had fallen from him on the second evening of recital ,— which appeared to this worthy Chamberlain to contain language and principles for which nothing short of the summary criticism of the Chabuk<span type="note_anchor">[ 270 ]</span>would be advisable . It was his intention therefore immediately on their arrival at Cashmere to give information to the King of Bucharia of the very dangerous sentiments of his minstrel ; and if unfortunately that monarch did not act with suitable vigor on the occasion , ( that is , if he did not give the Chabuk to FERAMORZ and a place to FADLADEEN . ) there would be an end , he feared , of all legitimate government in Bucharia . He could not help however auguring better both for himself and the cause of potentates in general ; and it was the pleasure arising from these mingled anticipations that diffused such unusual satisfaction through his features and made his eyes shine out like poppies of the desert over the wide and lifeless wilderness of that countenance .</p>
   <p>Having decided upon the Poet 's chastisement in this manner he thought it but humanity to spare him the minor tortures of criticism . Accordingly when they assembled the following evening in the pavilion and LALLA ROOKH was expecting to see all the beauties of her bard melt away one by one in the acidity of criticism , like pearls in the cup of the Egyptian queen .— he agreeably disappointed her by merely saying with an ironical smile that the merits of such a poem deserved to be tried at a much higher tribunal ; and then suddenly passed off into a panegyric upon all Mussulman sovereigns , more particularly his august and Imperial master , Aurungzebe , — the wisest and best of the descendants of Timur ,— who among other great things he had done for mankind had given to him , FADLADEEN , the very profitable posts of Betel-carrier and Taster of Sherbets to the Emperor , Chief Holder of the Girdle of Beautiful Forms ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 271 ]</span>and Grand Nazir or Chamberlain of the Haram .</p>
   <p>They were now not far from that Forbidden River<span type="note_anchor">[ 272 ]</span>beyond which no pure Hindoo can pass , and were reposing for a time in the rich valley of Hussun Abdaul , which had always been a favorite resting-place of the Emperors in their annual migrations to Cashmere . Here often had the Light of the Faith , Jehan-Guire , been known to wander with his beloved and beautiful Nourmahal , and here would LALLA ROOKH have been happy to remain for ever , giving up the throne of Bucharia and the world for FERAMORZ and love in this sweet , lonely valley . But the time was now fast approaching when she must see him no longer ,— or , what was still worse , behold him with eyes whose every look belonged to another , and there was a melancholy preciousness in these last moments , which made her heart cling to them as it would to life . During the latter part of the journey , indeed , she had sunk into a deep sadness from which nothing but the presence of the young minstrel could awake her . Like those lamps in tombs which only light up when the air is admitted , it was only at his approach that her eyes became smiling and animated . But here in this dear valley every moment appeared an age of pleasure ; she saw him all day and was therefore all day happy ,— resembling , she often thought , that people of Zinge<span type="note_anchor">[ 273 ]</span>who attribute the unfading cheerfulness they enjoy to one genial star that rises nightly over their heads .<span type="note_anchor">[ 274 ]</span></p>
   <p>The whole party indeed seemed in their liveliest mood during the few days they passed in this delightful solitude . The young attendants of the Princess who were here allowed a much freer range than they could safely be indulged with in a less sequestered place ran wild among the gardens and bounded through the meadows lightly as young roes over the aromatic plains of Tibet . While FADLADEEN , in addition to the spiritual comfort derived by him from a pilgrimage to the tomb of the Saint from whom the valley is named , had also opportunities of indulging in a small way his taste for victims by putting to death some hundreds of those unfortunate little lizards ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 275 ]</span>which all pious Mussulmans make it a point to kill ;— taking for granted that the manner in which the creature hangs its head is meant as a mimicry of the attitude in which the Faithful say their prayers .</p>
   <p>About two miles from Hussun Abdaul were those Royal Gardens which had grown beautiful under the care of so many lovely eyes , and were beautiful still though those eyes could see them no longer . This place , with its flowers and its holy silence interrupted only by the dipping of the wings of birds in its marble basins filled with the pure water of those hills , was to LALLA ROOKH all that her heart could fancy of fragrance , coolness , and almost heavenly tranquillity . As the Prophet said of Damascus , “ it was too delicious ;"[ 276 ] — and here in listening to the sweet voice of FERAMORZ or reading in his eyes what yet he never dared to tell her , the most exquisite moments of her whole life were passed . One evening when they had been talking of the Sultana Nourmahal , the Light of the Haram ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 277 ]</span>who had so often wandered among these flowers , and fed with her own hands in those marble basins the small shining fishes of which she was so fond ,— the youth in order to delay the moment of separation proposed to recite a short story or rather rhapsody of which this adored Sultana was the heroine . It related , he said , to the reconcilement of a sort of lovers ’ quarrel which took place between her and the Emperor during a Feast of Roses at Cashmere ; and would remind the Princess of that difference between Haroun-al-Raschid and his fair mistress Marida , which was so happily made up by the soft strains of the musician Moussali . As the story was chiefly to be told in song and FERAMORZ had unluckily forgotten his own lute in the valley , he borrowed the vina of LALLA ROOKH 'S little Persian slave , and thus began :—</p>

   <p>FADLADEEN , at the conclusion of this light rhapsody , took occasion to sum up his opinion of the young Cashmerian 's poetry ,— of which , he trusted , they had that evening heard the last . Having recapitulated the epithets , “ frivolous ” — “ inharmonious ” — “ nonsensical , ” he proceeded to say that , viewed in the most favorable light it resembled one of those Maldivian boats , to which the Princess had alluded in the relation of her dream ,— a slight , gilded thing , sent adrift without rudder or ballast , and with nothing but vapid sweets and faded flowers on board . The profusion , indeed , of flowers and birds , which this poet had ready on all occasions , — not to mention dews , gems , etc .— was a most oppressive kind of opulence to his hearers ; and had the unlucky effect of giving to his style all the glitter of the flower garden without its method , and all the flutter of the aviary without its song . In addition to this , he chose his subjects badly , and was always most inspired by the worst parts of them . The charms of paganism , the merits of rebellion ,— these were the themes honored with his particular enthusiasm ; and , in the poem just recited , one of his most palatable passages was in praise of that beverage of the Unfaithful , wine ;— “ being , perhaps , ” said he , relaxing into a smile , as conscious of his own character in the Haram on this point , “ one of those bards , whose fancy owes all its illumination to the grape , like that painted porcelain ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 341 ]</span>so curious and so rare , whose images are only visible when liquor is poured into it . ” Upon the whole , it was his opinion , from the specimens which they had heard , and which , he begged to say , were the most tiresome part of the journey , that — whatever other merits this well-dressed young gentleman might possess — poetry was by no means his proper avocation ; “ and indeed , ” concluded the critic , “ from his fondness for flowers and for birds , I would venture to suggest that a florist or a bird-catcher is a much more suitable calling for him than a poet . ”</p>
   <p>They had now begun to ascend those barren mountains , which separate Cashmere from the rest of India ; and , as the heats were intolerable , and the time of their encampments limited to the few hours necessary for refreshment and repose , there was an end to all their delightful evenings , and LALLA ROOKH saw no more of FERAMORZ . She now felt that her short dream of happiness was over , and that she had nothing but the recollection of its few blissful hours , like the one draught of sweet water that serves the camel across the wilderness , to be her heart 's refreshment during the dreary waste of life that was before her . The blight that had fallen upon her spirits soon found its way to her cheek , and her ladies saw with regret — though not without some suspicion of the cause — that the beauty of their mistress , of which they were almost as proud as of their own , was fast vanishing away at the very moment of all when she had most need of it . What must the King of Bucharia feel , when , instead of the lively and beautiful LALLA ROOKH , whom the poets of Delhi had described as more perfect than the divinest images in the house of AZOR ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 342 ]</span>he should receive a pale and inanimate victim , upon whose cheek neither health nor pleasure bloomed , and from whose eyes Love had fled ,— to hide himself in her heart ?</p>
   <p>If any thing could have charmed away the melancholy of her spirits , it would have been the fresh airs and enchanting scenery of that Valley , which the Persians so justly called the Unequalled .<span type="note_anchor">[ 343 ]</span>But neither the coolness of its atmosphere , so luxurious after toiling up those bare and burning mountains ,— neither the splendor of the minarets and pagodas , that shone put from the depth of its woods , nor the grottoes , hermitages , and miraculous fountains ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 344 ]</span>which make every spot of that region holy ground ,— neither the countless waterfalls , that rush into the Valley from all those high and romantic mountains that encircle it , nor the fair city on the Lake , whose houses , roofed with flowers ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 345 ]</span>appeared at a distance like one vast and variegated parterre ;— not all these wonders and glories of the most lovely country under the sun could steal her heart for a minute from those sad thoughts which but darkened and grew bitterer every step she advanced .</p>
   <p>The gay pomps and processions that met her upon her entrance into the Valley , and the magnificence with which the roads all along were decorated , did honor to the taste and gallantry of the young King . It was night when they approached the city , and , for the last two miles , they had passed under arches , thrown from hedge to hedge , festooned with only those rarest roses from which the Attar Gul , more precious than gold , is distilled , and illuminated in rich and fanciful forms with lanterns of the triple-colored tortoise-shell of Pegu .<span type="note_anchor">[ 346 ]</span>Sometimes , from a dark wood by the side of the road , a display of fireworks would break out , so sudden and so brilliant , that a Brahmin might fancy he beheld that grove , in whose purple shade the God of Battles was born , bursting into a flame at the moment of his birth ;— while , at other times , a quick and playful irradiation continued to brighten all the fields and gardens by which they passed , forming a line of dancing lights along the horizon ; like the meteors of the north as they are seen by those hunters who pursue the white and blue foxes on the confines of the Icy Sea .</p>
   <p>These arches and fireworks delighted the Ladies of the Princess exceedingly ; and , with their usual good logic , they deduced from his taste for illuminations , that the King of Bucharia would make the most exemplary husband imaginable . Nor , indeed , could LALLA ROOKH herself help feeling the kindness and splendor with which the young bridegroom welcomed her ;— but she also felt how painful is the gratitude which kindness from those we cannot love excites ; and that their best blandishments come over the heart with all that chilling and deadly sweetness which we can fancy in the cold , odoriferous wind<span type="note_anchor">[ 347 ]</span>that is to blow over this earth in the last days .</p>
   <p>The marriage was fixed for the morning after her arrival , when she was , for the first time , to be presented to the monarch in that Imperial Palace beyond the lake , called the Shalimar . Though never before had a night of more wakeful and anxious thought been passed in the Happy Valley , yet , when she rose in the morning , and her Ladies came around her , to assist in the adjustment of the bridal ornaments , they thought they had never seen her look half so beautiful . What she had lost of the bloom and radiancy of her charms was more than made up by that intellectual expression , that soul beaming forth from the eyes , which is worth all the rest of loveliness . When they had tinged her fingers with the Henna leaf , and placed upon her brow a small coronet of jewels , of the shape worn by the ancient Queens of Bucharia , they flung over her head the rose-colored bridal veil , and she proceeded to the barge that was to convey her across the lake ;— first kissing , with a mournful look , the little amulet of cornelian , which her father at parting had hung about her neck .</p>
   <p>The morning was as fresh and fair as the maid on whose nuptials it rose , and the shining lake , all covered with boats , the minstrels playing upon the shores of the islands , and the crowded summer-houses on the green hills around , with shawls and banners waving from their roofs , presented such a picture of animated rejoicing , as only she , who was the object of it all , did not feel with transport . To LALLA ROOKH alone it was a melancholy pageant ; nor could she have even borne to look upon the scene , were it not for a hope that among the crowds around , she might once more perhaps catch a glimpse of FERAMORZ . So much was her imagination haunted by this thought that there was scarcely an islet or boat she passed on the way at which her heart did not flutter with the momentary fancy that he was there . Happy , in her eyes , the humblest slave upon whom the light of his dear looks fell !— In the barge immediately after the Princess sat FADLADEEN , with his silken curtains thrown widely apart , that all might have the benefit of his august presence , and with his head full of the speech he was to deliver to the King , “ concerning FERAMORZ and literature and the Chabuk as connected therewith . ”</p>
   <p>They now had entered the canal which leads from the Lake to the splendid domes and saloons of the Shalimar and went gliding on through the gardens that ascended from each bank , full of flowering shrubs that made the air all perfume ; while from the middle of the canal rose jets of water , smooth and unbroken , to such a dazzling height that they stood like tall pillars of diamond in the sunshine . After sailing under the arches of various saloons they at length arrived at the last and most magnificent , where the monarch awaited the coming of his bride ; and such was the agitation of her heart and frame that it was with difficulty she could walk up the marble steps which were covered with cloth of gold for her ascent from the barge . At the end of the hall stood two thrones , as precious as the Cerulean Throne of Koolburga ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 348 ]</span>on one of which sat ALIRIS , the youthful King of Bucharia , and on the other was in a few minutes to be placed the most beautiful Princess in the world . Immediately upon the entrance of LALLA ROOKH into the saloon the monarch descended from his throne to meet her ; but scarcely had he time to take her hand in his when she screamed with surprise and fainted at his feet . It was FERAMORZ , himself , who stood before her ! FERAMORZ , was , himself , the Sovereign of Bucharia , who in this disguise had accompanied his young bride from Delhi , and having won her love as an humble minstrel now amply deserved to enjoy it as a King .</p>
   <p>The consternation of FADLADEEN at this discovery was , for the moment , almost pitiable . But change of opinion is a resource too convenient in courts for this experienced courtier not to have learned to avail himself of it . His criticisms were all , of course , recanted instantly : he was seized with an admiration of the King 's verses , as unbounded as , he begged him to believe , it was disinterested ; and the following week saw him in possession of an additional place , swearing by all the Saints of Islam that never had there existed so great a poet as the Monarch ALIRIS , and moreover ready to prescribe his favorite regimen of the Chabuk for every man , woman and child that dared to think otherwise .</p>
   <p>Of the happiness of the King and Queen of Bucharia , after such a beginning , there can be but little doubt ; and among the lesser symptoms it is recorded of LALLA ROOKH that to the day of her death in memory of their delightful journey she never called the King by any other name than FERAMORZ .</p>

They say that it was in length nine feet , and three in breadth ; made of ebony covered with plates of pure gold , and set with precious stones of immense value . Every prince of the house of Bhamenee , who possessed this throne , made a point of adding to it some rich stones ; so that when in the reign of Sultan Mamood it was taken to pieces to remove some of the jewels to be set in vases and cups , the jewellers valued it at one corore of oons ( nearly four millions sterling ) . I learned also that it was called Firozeh from being partly enamelled of a sky-blue color which was in time totally concealed by the number of jewels . ” — Ferishta .</p>
   <p>THE LOVES OF THE ANGELS .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The Eastern story of the angels Harut and Marut and the Rabbinical fictions of the loves of Uzziel and Shámchazai are the only sources to which I need refer for the origin of the notion on which this Romance is founded . In addition to the fitness of the subject for poetry , it struck me also as capable of affording an allegorical medium through which might be shadowed out ( as I have endeavored to do in the following stories ) the fall of the Soul from its original purity<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>— the loss of light and happiness which it suffers , in the pursuit of this world 's perishable pleasures — and the punishments both from conscience and Divine justice with which impurity , pride , and presumptuous inquiry into the awful secrets of Heaven are sure to be visited — The beautiful story of Cupid and Psyche owes its chief charm to this sort of “ veiled meaning , ” and it has been my wish ( however I may have failed in the attempt ) to communicate to the following pages the same moral interest .</p>
   <p>Among the doctrines or notions derived by Plato from the East , one of the most natural and sublime is that which inculcates the pre-existence of the soul and its gradual descent into this dark material world from that region of spirit and light which it is supposed to have once inhabited and to which after a long lapse of purification and trial it will return . This belief under various symbolical forms may be traced through almost all the Oriental theologies . The Chaldeans represent the Soul as originally endowed with wings which fall away when it sinks from its native element and must be re-produced before it can hope to return . Some disciples of Zoroaster once inquired of him , “ How the wings of the Soul might be made to grow again ? ”</p>
   <p>“ By sprinkling them , ” he replied , “ with the Waters of Life . ”</p>
   <p>“ But where are those Waters to be found ? ” they asked .</p>
   <p>“ In the Garden of God , ” replied Zoroaster .</p>
   <p>The mythology of the Persians has allegorized the same doctrine , in the history of those genii of light who strayed from their dwellings in the stars and obscured their original nature by mixture with this material sphere ; while the Egyptians connecting it with the descent and ascent of the sun in the zodiac considered Autumn as emblematic of the Soul 's decline toward darkness and the re-appearance of Spring as its return to life and light .</p>
   <p>Besides the chief spirits of the Mahometan heaven , such as Gabriel the angel of Revelation , Israfil by whom the last trumpet is to be sounded , and Azrael the angel of death , there were also a number of subaltern intelligences of which tradition has preserved the names , appointed to preside over the different stages of ascents into which the celestial world was supposed to be divided .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Thus Kelail governs the fifth heaven ; while Sadiel , the presiding spirit of the third , is also employed in steadying the motions of the earth which would be in a constant state of agitation if this angel did not keep his foot planted upon its orb .</p>
   <p>Among other miraculous interpositions in favor of Mahomet we find commemorated in the pages of the Koran the appearance of five thousand angels on his side at the battle of Bedr .</p>
   <p>The ancient Persians supposed that Ormuzd appointed thirty angels to preside successively over the days of the month and twelve greater ones to assume the government of the months themselves ; among whom Bahman ( to whom Ormuzd committed the custody of all animals , except man ) was the greatest . Mihr , the angel of the 7th month , was also the spirit that watched over the affairs of friendship and love ;— Chûr had the care of the disk of the sun ;— Mah was agent for the concerns of the moon ;— Isphandârmaz ( whom Cazvin calls the Spirit of the Earth ) was the tutelar genius of good and virtuous women , etc . For all this the reader may consult the 19th and 20th chapters of Hyde , “ de Religione Veterum Persarum , ” where the names and attributes of these daily and monthly angels are with much minuteness and erudition explained . It appears from the Zend-avesta that the Persians had a certain office or prayer for every day of the month ( addressed to the particular angel who presided over it ) , which they called the Sirouzé .</p>
   <p>The Celestial Hierarchy of the Syrians , as described by Kircher , appears to be the most regularly graduated of any of these systems . In the sphere of the Moon they placed the angels , in that of Mercury the archangels , Venus and the Sun contained the Principalities and the Powers ;— and so on to the summit of the planetary system , where , in the sphere of Saturn , the Thrones had their station . Above this was the habitation of the Cherubim in the sphere of the fixed stars ; and still higher , in the region of those stars which are so distant as to be imperceptible , the Seraphim , we are told , the most perfect of all celestial creatures , dwelt .</p>
   <p>The Sabeans also ( as D'Herbelot tells us ) had their classes of angels , to whom they prayed as mediators , or intercessors ; and the Arabians worshipped female angels , whom they called Benab Hasche , or , Daughters of God .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The account which Macrobius gives of the downward journey of the Soul , through that gate of the zodiac which opens into the lower spheres , is a curious specimen of the wild fancies that passed for philosophy in ancient times .</p>

     <l n="7">And mid-way choosing where to light ,</l>
     <l n="8">I saw from the blue element —</l>
     <l n="9">Oh beautiful , but fatal sight !—</l>
     <l n="10">One of earth 's fairest womankind ,</l>
     <l n="11">Half veiled from view , or rather shrined</l>
     <l n="12">In the clear crystal of a brook ;</l>

     <l n="21">At length as from that airy height</l>

     <l n="25">Startled her as she reached the shore</l>
     <l n="26">Of that small lake — her mirror still —</l>
     <l n="27">Above whose brink she stood , like snow</l>
     <l n="28">When rosy with a sunset glow ,</l>
     <l n="29">Never shall I forget those eyes !—</l>
     <l n="30">The shame , the innocent surprise</l>
     <l n="31">Of that bright face when in the air</l>
     <l n="32">Uplooking she beheld me there .</l>
     <l n="33">It seemed as if each thought and look</l>
     <l n="34">And motion were that minute chained</l>
     <l n="35">Fast to the spot , such root she took ,</l>
     <l n="36">And — like a sunflower by a brook ,</l>

     <l n="152">No matter where my wanderings were ,</l>
     <l n="153">So there she lookt , breathed , moved about —</l>

     <l n="156">But to return — that very day</l>
     <l n="157">A feast was held , where , full of mirth ,</l>
     <l n="158">Came — crowding thick as flowers that play</l>
     <l n="159">In summer winds — the young and gay</l>
     <l n="160">And beautiful of this bright earth .</l>
     <l n="161">And she was there and mid the young</l>
     <l n="162">And beautiful stood first , alone ;</l>
     <l n="163">Tho ’ on her gentle brow still hung</l>
     <l n="164">The shadow I that morn had thrown —</l>
     <l n="165">The first that ever shame or woe</l>
     <l n="166">Had cast upon its vernal snow .</l>
     <l n="167">My heart was maddened ;— in the flush</l>
     <l n="168">Of the wild revel I gave way</l>
     <l n="169">To all that frantic mirth — that rush</l>
     <l n="170">Of desperate gayety which they ,</l>
     <l n="171">Who never felt how pain 's excess</l>
     <l n="172">Can break out thus , think happiness !</l>
     <l n="173">Sad mimicry of mirth and life</l>
     <l n="174">Whose flashes come but from the strife</l>
     <l n="175">Of inward passions — like the light</l>
     <l n="176">Struck out by clashing swords in fight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="177">Then too that juice of earth , the bane</l>
     <l n="178">And blessing of man 's heart and brain —</l>
     <l n="179">That draught of sorcery which brings</l>
     <l n="180">Phantoms of fair , forbidden things —</l>

     <l n="182">Upon the mists that circle man ,</l>
     <l n="183">Brightening not only Earth the while ,</l>
     <l n="184">But grasping Heaven too in their span !—</l>

     <l n="188">To my lost soul into eclipse ;</l>

     <l n="199">Her eyes as usual were upturned</l>
     <l n="200">To her loved star whose lustre burned</l>
     <l n="201">Purer than ever on that night ;</l>

     <l n="210">And lips that burned in their own sighs ,</l>
     <l n="211">I stood to gaze with awe and shame —</l>
     <l n="212">The memory of Eden came</l>
     <l n="213">Full o'er me when I saw those eyes ;</l>

     <l n="215">To the pale , shrinking maiden proved</l>
     <l n="216">How far , alas ! from aught divine ,</l>
     <l n="217">Aught worthy of so pure a shrine ,</l>
     <l n="218">Was the wild love with which I loved ,</l>

     <l n="221">The deep , true , soul-felt tenderness ,</l>

     <l n="223">To her , a mortal , whom pure love</l>
     <l n="224">Then placed above him — far above —</l>
     <l n="225">And all that struggle to repress</l>
     <l n="226">A sinful spirit 's mad excess ,</l>
     <l n="227">Which workt within me at that hour ,</l>

     <l n="2">When unto Eden 's new-made bowers</l>
     <l n="3">ALLA convoked the bright array</l>
     <l n="4">Of his supreme angelic powers</l>
     <l n="5">To witness the one wonder yet ,</l>
     <l n="6">Beyond man , angel , star , or sun ,</l>

     <l n="10">That crowning of creation 's birth ,</l>

     <l n="12">Of circling angels Woman 's eyes</l>
     <l n="13">First open upon heaven and earth ;</l>
     <l n="14">And from their lids a thrill was sent ,</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>A belief that the stars are either spirits or the vehicles of spirits , was common to all the religions and heresies of the East .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>According to the cosmogony of the ancient Persians , there were four stars set as sentinels in the four quarters of the heavens , to watch over the other fixed stars , and superintend the planets in their course . The names of these four Sentinel stars are , according to the Boundesh , Taschter , for the east ; Satevis , for the west ; Venand , for the south ; and Haftorang . for the north .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>According to Whitehurst 's theory , the mention of rainbows by an antediluvian angel is an anachronism ; as he says , “ There was no rain before the flood , and consequently no rainbow , which accounts for the novelty of this sight after the Deluge . ”</p>

   <p>CORRUPTION ,</p>
   <p>AND</p>
   <p>INTOLERANCE .</p>
   <p>TWO POEMS .</p>
   <p>ADDRESSED TO AN ENGLISHMAN BY AN IRISHMAN .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The practice which has been lately introduced into literature , of writing very long notes upon very indifferent verses , appears to me a rather happy invention , as it supplies us with a mode of turning dull poetry to account ; and as horses too heavy for the saddle may yet serve well enough to draw lumber , so Poems of this kind make excellent beasts of burden and will bear notes though they may not bear reading . Besides , the comments in such cases are so little under the necessity of paying any servile deference to the text , that they may even adopt that Socratic , “ quod supra nos nihil ad nos . ”</p>
   <p>In the first of the two following Poems , I have ventured to speak of the Revolution of 1688 , in language which has sometimes been employed by Tory writers and which is therefore neither very new nor popular . But however an Englishman might be reproached with ingratitude for depreciating the merits and results of a measure which he is taught to regard as the source of his liberties — however ungrateful it might appear in Alderman Birch to question for a moment the purity of that glorious era to which he is indebted for the seasoning of so many orations — yet an Irishman who has none of these obligations to acknowledge , to whose country the Revolution brought nothing but injury and insult , and who recollects that the book of Molyneux was burned by order of William 's Whig Parliament for daring to extend to unfortunate Ireland those principles on which the Revolution was professedly founded — an Irishman may be allowed to criticise freely the measures of that period without exposing himself either to the imputation of ingratitude or to the suspicion of being influenced by any Popish remains of Jacobitism . No nation , it is true , was ever blessed with a more golden opportunity of establishing and securing its liberties for ever than the conjuncture of Eighty-eight presented to the people of Great Britain . But the disgraceful reigns of Charles and James had weakened and degraded the national character . The bold notions of popular right which had arisen out of the struggles between Charles the First and his Parliament were gradually supplanted by those slavish doctrines for which Lord Hawkesbury eulogizes the churchmen of that period , and as the Reformation had happened too soon for the purity of religion , so the Revolution came too late for the spirit of liberty . Its advantages accordingly were for the most part specious and transitory , while the evils which it entailed are still felt and still increasing . By rendering unnecessary the frequent exercise of Prerogative ,— that unwieldy power which cannot move a step without alarm ,— it diminished the only interference of the Crown , which is singly and independently exposed before the people , and whose abuses therefore are obvious to their senses and capabilities . Like the myrtle over a celebrated statue in Minerva 's temple at Athens , it skilfully veiled from the public eye the only obtrusive feature of royalty . At the same time , however , that the Revolution abridged this unpopular attribute , it amply compensated by the substitution of a new power , as much more potent in its effect as it is more secret in its operations . In the disposal of an immense revenue and the extensive patronage annexed to it , the first foundations of this power of the Crown were laid ; the innovation of a standing army at once increased and strengthened it , and the few slight barriers which the Act of Settlement opposed to its progress have all been gradually removed during the Whiggish reigns that succeeded ; till at length this spirit of influence has become the vital principle of the state ,— an agency , subtle and unseen , which pervades every part of the Constitution , lurks under all its forms and regulates all its movements , and , like the invisible sylph or grace which presides over the motions of beauty ,</p>
   <p>“ illam , quicquid agit , quoquo westigia flectit , componit furlim subsequiturque . ”</p>
   <p>The cause of Liberty and the Revolution are so habitually associated in the minds of Englishmen that probably in objecting to the latter I may be thought hostile or indifferent to the former . But assuredly nothing could be more unjust than such a suspicion . The very object indeed which my humble animadversions would attain is that in the crisis to which I think England is now hastening , and between which and foreign subjugation she may soon be compelled to choose , the errors and omissions of 1688 should be remedied ; and , as it was then her fate to experience a Revolution without Reform , so she may now endeavor to accomplish a Reform without Revolution .</p>
   <p>In speaking of the parties which have so long agitated England , it will be observed that I lean as little to the Whigs as to their adversaries . Both factions have been equally cruel to Ireland and perhaps equally insincere in their efforts for the liberties of England . There is one name indeed connected with Whiggism , of which I can never think but with veneration and tenderness . As justly , however , might the light of the sun be claimed by any particular nation as the sanction of that name be monopolized by any party whatsoever . Mr. Fox belonged to mankind and they have lost in him their ablest friend .</p>
   <p>With respect to the few lines upon Intolerance , which I have subjoined , they are but the imperfect beginning of a long series of Essays with which I here menace my readers upon the same important subject . I shall look to no higher merit in the task than that of giving a new form to claims and remonstrances which have often been much more eloquently urged and which would long ere now have produced their effect , but that the minds of some of our statesmen , like the pupil of the human eye , contract themselves the more , the stronger light is shed upon them .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>England began very early to feel the effects of cruelty towards her dependencies . “ The severity of her government [ says Macpherson ] contributed more to deprive her of the continental dominions of the family of the Plantagenet than the arms of France . ” — See his History , vol . i .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>“ By the total reduction of the kingdom of Ireland in 1691 [ says Burke ] , the ruin of the native Irish , and in a great measure , too , of the first races of the English , was completely accomplished . The new English interested was settled with as solid a stability as anything in human affairs can look for . All the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppression , which were made after the last event , were manifestly the effects of national hatred and scorn towards a conquered people , whom the victors delighted to trample upon , and were not at all afraid to provoke . ” Yet this is the era to which the wise Common Council of Dublin refer us for “ invaluable blessings , ” etc .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The drivelling correspondence between James I and his “ dog Steenie ” ( the Duke of Buckingham ) , which we find among the Hardwicke Papers , sufficiently shows , if we wanted any such illustration , into what doting , idiotic brains the plan at arbitrary power may enter .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Tacitus has expressed his opinion , in a passage very frequently quoted , that such a distribution of power as the theory of the British constitution exhibits is merely a subject of bright speculation , “ a system more easily praised than practised , and which , even could it happen to exist , would certainly not prove permanent ; ” and , in truth , a review of England 's annals would dispose us to agree with the great historian 's remark . For we find that at no period whatever has this balance of the three estates existed ; that the nobles predominated till the policy of Henry VII , and his successor reduced their weight by breaking up the feudal system of property ; that the power of the Crown became then supreme and absolute , till the bold encroachments of the Commons subverted the fabric altogether ; that the alternate ascendency of prerogative and privilege distracted the period which followed the Restoration ; and that lastly , the Acts of 1688 , by laying the foundation of an unbounded court - influence , have secured a preponderance to the Throne , which every succeeding year increases . So that the vaunted British constitution has never perhaps existed but in mere theory .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>The last great wound given to the feudal system was the Act of the 12th of Charles II , which abolished the tenure of knight 's service in capite , and which Blackstone compares , for its salutary influence upon property , to the boasted provisions of Magna Charta itself . Yet even in this act we see the effects of that counteracting spirit which has contrived to weaken every effort of the English nation towards liberty .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>“ They drove so fast [ says Wellwood of the ministers of Charles I . ] , that it was no wonder that the wheels and chariot broke . ” — ( Memoirs p . 86 . )</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Among those auxiliaries which the Revolution of 1688 marshalled on the side of the Throne , the bugbear of Popery has not been the least convenient and serviceable . Those unskilful tyrants , Charles and James , instead of profiting by that useful subserviency which has always distinguished the ministers of our religious establishment , were so infatuated as to plan the ruin of this best bulwark of their power and moreover connected their designs upon the Church so undisguisedly with their attacks upon the Constitution that they identified in the minds of the people the interests of their religion and their liberties . During those times therefore “ No Popery ” was the watchword of freedom and served to keep the public spirit awake against the invasions of bigotry and prerogative .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>“ It is a scandal [ said Sir Charles Sedley in William 's reign ] that a government so sick at heart as ours is should look so well in the face . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>The senate still continued , during the reign of Tiberius , to manage all the business of the public : the money was then and long after coined by their authority , and every other public affair received their sanction .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>There is something very touching in what Tacitus tells us of the hopes that revived in a few patriot bosoms , when the death of Augustus was near approaching , and the fond expectation with which they already began “ bona libertatis incassum disserere . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Andrew Marvell , the honest opposer of the court during the reign of Charles the Second , and the last member of parliament who , according to the ancient mode , took wages from his constituents . The Commons have , since then , much changed their pay-masters .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>According to Xenophon , the chief circumstance which recommended these creatures to the service of Eastern princes was the ignominious station they held in society , and the probability of their being , upon this account , more devoted to the will and caprice of a master , from whose notice alone they derived consideration , and in whose favor they might seek refuge from the general contempt of mankind .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>Among the many measures , which , since the Revolution , have contributed to increase the influence of the Throne , and to feed up this “ Aaron 's serpent ” of the constitution to its present healthy and respectable magnitude , there have been few more nutritive than the Scotch and Irish Unions .</p>

   <p>THE SCEPTIC ,</p>
   <p>A PHILOSOPHICAL SATIRE .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The Sceptical Philosophy of the Ancients has been no less misrepresented than the Epicurean . Pyrrho may perhaps have carried it to rather an irrational excess ;— but we must not believe with Beattie all the absurdities imputed to this philosopher ; and it appears to me that the doctrines of the school , as explained by Sextus Empiricus , are far more suited to the wants and infirmities of human reason as well as more conducive to the mild virtues of humility and patience , than any of those systems of philosophy which preceded the introduction of Christianity . The Sceptics may be said to have held a middle path between the Dogmatists and Academicians ; the former of whom boasted that they had attained the truth while the latter denied that any attainable truth existed . The Sceptics however , without either asserting or denying its existence , professed to be modestly and anxiously in search of it ; or , as St. Augustine expresses it , in his liberal tract against the Manichaeans , “ nemo nostrum dicat jam se invenisse veritatem ; sic eam quoeramus quasi ab utrisque nesciatur . ” From this habit of impartial investigation and the necessity which it imposed upon them of studying not only every system of philosophy but every art and science which professed to lay its basis in truth , they necessarily took a wider range of erudition and were far more travelled in the regions of philosophy than those whom conviction or bigotry had domesticated in any particular system . It required all the learning of dogmatism to overthrow the dogmatism of learning ; and the Sceptics may be said to resemble in this respect that ancient incendiary who stole from the altar the fire with which he destroyed the temple . This advantage over all the other sects is allowed to them even by Lipsius , whose treatise on the miracles of the Virgo Hallensis will sufficiently save him from all suspicion of scepticism . “ labore , ingenio , memoria , ” he says , “ supra omnes pene philosophos fuisse .— quid nonne omnia aliorum secta tenere debuerunt et inquirere , si poterunt refellere ? res dicit nonne orationes varias , raras , subtiles inveniri ad tam receptas , claras , certas ( ut videbatur ) sententias evertendas ? ” etc .— “ Manuduct . ad Philosoph . Stoic . ” Dissert . 4 .</p>
   <p>Between the scepticism of the ancients and the moderns the great difference is that the former doubted for the purpose of investigating , as may be exemplified by the third book of Aristotle 's Metaphysics , while the latter investigate for the purpose of doubting , as may be seen through most of the philosophical works of Hume . Indeed the Pyrrhonism of latter days is not only more subtle than that of antiquity , but , it must be confessed , more dangerous in its tendency . The happiness of a Christian depends so essentially upon his belief , that it is but natural he should feel alarm at the progress of doubt , lest it should steal by degrees into that region from which he is most interested in excluding it , and poison at last the very spring of his consolation and hope . Still however the abuses of doubting ought not to deter a philosophical mind from indulging mildly and rationally in its use ; and there is nothing surely more consistent with the meek spirit of Christianity than that humble scepticism which professes not to extend its distrust beyond the circle of human pursuits and the pretensions of human knowledge . A follower of this school may be among the readiest to admit the claims of a superintending Intelligence upon his faith and adoration : it is only to the wisdom of this weak world that he refuses or at least delays his assent ;— it is only in passing through the shadow of earth that his mind undergoes the eclipse of scepticism . No follower of Pyrrho has ever spoken more strongly against the dogmatists than St. Paul himself , in the First Epistle to the Corinthians ; and there are passages in Ecclesiastes and other parts of Scripture , which justify our utmost diffidence in all that human reason originates . Even the Sceptics of antiquity refrained carefully from the mysteries of theology , and in entering the temples of religion laid aside their philosophy at the porch . Sextus Empiricus declares the acquiescence of his sect in the general belief of a divine and foreknowing Power :— In short it appears to me that this rational and well-regulated scepticism is the only daughter of the Schools that can safely be selected as a handmaid for Piety . He who distrusts the light of reason will be the first to follow a more luminous guide ; and if with an ardent love for truth he has sought her in vain through the ways of this life , he will but turn with the more hope to that better world where all is simple , true and everlasting : for there is no parallax at the zenith ;— it is only near our troubled horizon that objects deceive us into vague and erroneous calculations .</p>

Take away the sensation of them ; let not the eye see light or colors , nor the ears hear sounds ; let the palate not taste nor the nose smell , and all colors , tastes , odors and sounds , as they are such particular ideas , vanish and cease . ” — Locke , book ii . chap 8 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>This was the creed also of those modern Epicureans , whom Ninon de l'Enclos collected around her in the Rue des Tournelles , and whose object seems to have been to decry the faculty of reason , as tending only to embarrass our wholesome use of pleasures , without enabling us , in any degree , to avoid their abuse . Madame des Houlières , the fair pupil of Des Barreaux in the arts of poetry and gallantry , has devoted most of her verses to this laudable purpose , and is even such a determined foe to reason , that , in one of her pastorals , she congratulates her sheep on the want of it .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Socrates and Plato were the grand sources of ancient scepticism . According to Cicero ( “ de Orator , ” lib . iii . ) , they supplied Arcesilas with the doctrines of the Middle Academy ; and how closely these resembled the tenets of the Sceptics , may be seen even in Sextus Empiricus ( lib . i. cap . 33 ) , who with all his distinctions can scarcely prove any difference . It appears strange that Epicurus should have been a dogmatist ; and his natural temper would most probably have led him to the repose of scepticism had not the Stoics by their violent opposition to his doctrines compelled him to be as obstinate as themselves .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Descartes , who is considered as the parent of modern scepticism , says , that there is nothing in the whole range of philosophy which does not admit of two opposite opinions , and which is not involved in doubt and uncertainty . Gassendi is likewise to be added to the list of modern Sceptics , and Wedderkopff , has denounced Erasmus also as a follower of Pyrrho , for his opinions upon the Trinity , and some other subjects .

   <p>STEPHEN WOOLRICHE , ESQ .</p>
   <p>MY DEAR WOOLRICHE ,—</p>
   <p>It is now about seven years since I promised ( and I grieve to think it is almost as long since we met ) to dedicate to you the very first Book , of whatever size or kind I should publish . Who could have thought that so many years would elapse , without my giving the least signs of life upon the subject of this important promise ? Who could have imagined that a volume of doggerel , after all , would be the first offering that Gratitude would lay upon the shrine of Friendship ?</p>
   <p>If you continue , however , to be as much interested about me and my pursuits as formerly , you will be happy to hear that doggerel is not my only occupation ; but that I am preparing to throw my name to the Swans of the Temple of Immortality , leaving it of course to the said Swans to determine whether they ever will take the trouble of picking it from the stream .</p>
   <p>In the meantime , my dear Woolriche , like an orthodox Lutheran , you must judge of me rather by my faith than my works ; and however trifling the tribute which I here offer , never doubt the fidelity with which I am and always shall be</p>
   <p>Your sincere and attached friend ,</p>

   <p>The Bag , from which the following Letters are selected , was dropped by a Twopenny Postman about two months since , and picked up by an emissary of the Society for the Suppression of Vice , who supposing it might materially assist the private researches of that Institution , immediately took it to his employers and was rewarded handsomely for his trouble . Such a treasury of secrets was worth a whole host of informers ; and , accordingly , like the Cupids of the poet ( if I may use so profane a simile ) who “ fell at odds about the sweet-bag of a bee ,"[ 1 ] those venerable Suppressors almost fought with each other for the honor and delight of first ransacking the Post-Bag . Unluckily , however , it turned out upon examination that the discoveries of profligacy which it enabled them to make , lay chiefly in those upper regions of society which their well-bred regulations forbid them to molest or meddle with .— In consequence they gained but very few victims by their prize , and after lying for a week or two under Mr. Hatchard 's counter the Bag with its violated contents was sold for a trifle to a friend of mine .</p>
   <p>It happened that I had been just then seized with an ambition ( having never tried the strength of my wing but in a Newspaper ) to publish something or other in the shape of a Book ; and it occurred to me that , the present being such a letter-writing era , a few of these Twopenny-Post Epistles turned into easy verse would be as light and popular a task as I could possibly select for a commencement . I did not , however , think it prudent to give too many Letters at first and accordingly have been obliged ( in order to eke out a sufficient number of pages ) to reprint some of those trifles , which had already appeared in the public journals . As in the battles of ancient times , the shades of the departed were sometimes seen among the combatants , so I thought I might manage to remedy the thinness of my ranks , by conjuring up a few dead and forgotten ephemerons to fill them .</p>
   <p>Such are the motives and accidents that led to the present publication ; and as this is the first time my Muse has ever ventured out of the go-cart of a Newspaper , though I feel all a parent 's delight at seeing little Miss go alone , I am also not without a parent 's anxiety lest an unlucky fall should be the consequence of the experiment ; and I need not point out how many living instances might be found of Muses that have suffered very severely in their heads from taking rather too early and rashly to their feet . Besides , a Book is so very different a thing from a Newspaper !— in the former , your doggerel without either company or shelter must stand shivering in the middle of a bleak page by itself ; whereas in the latter it is comfortably backed by advertisements and has sometimes even a Speech of Mr. Stephen 's , or something equally warm , for a chauffe-pieds — so that , in general , the very reverse of “ laudatur et alget ” is its destiny .</p>
   <p>Ambition , however , must run some risks and I shall be very well satisfied if the reception of these few Letters should have the effect of sending me to the Post-Bag for more .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">FROM THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE OF WALES</l>
     <l n="2">TO THE LADY BARBARA ASHLER .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">My dear Lady Bab , you 'll be shockt I 'm afraid ,</l>
     <l n="4">When you hear the sad rumpus your Ponies have made ;</l>
     <l n="5">Since the time of horse-consuls ( now long out of date ) ,</l>
     <l n="6">No nags ever made such a stir in the state .</l>
     <l n="7">Lord Eldon first heard — and as instantly prayed he</l>
     <l n="8">To “ God and his King ” — that a Popish young Lady</l>
     <l n="9">( For tho ’ you 've bright eyes and twelve thousand a year ,</l>
     <l n="10">It is still but too true you 're a Papist , my dear ,)</l>
     <l n="11">Had insidiously sent , by a tall Irish groom ,</l>
     <l n="12">Two priest-ridden ponies just landed from Rome ,</l>
     <l n="13">And so full , little rogues , of pontifical tricks</l>
     <l n="14">That the dome of St. Paul was scarce safe from their kicks .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Off at once to Papa in a flurry he flies —</l>
     <l n="16">For Papa always does what these statesmen advise</l>
     <l n="17">On condition that they 'll be in turn so polite</l>
     <l n="18">As in no case whate'er to advise him too right —</l>
     <l n="19">“ Pretty doings are here , Sir ( he angrily cries ,</l>
     <l n="20">While by dint of dark eyebrows he strives to look wise ) —</l>
     <l n="21">“ ‘ Tis a scheme of the Romanists , so help me God !</l>
     <l n="22">“ To ride over your most Royal Highness roughshod —</l>
     <l n="23">“ Excuse , Sir , my tears — they 're from loyalty 's source-</l>
     <l n="24">“ Bad enough ‘ twas for Troy to be sackt by a Horse ,</l>
     <l n="25">“ But for us to be ruined by Ponies still worse ! ”</l>
     <l n="26">Quick a Council is called — the whole Cabinet sits —</l>
     <l n="27">The Archbishops declare , frightened out of their wits ,</l>
     <l n="28">That if once Popish Ponies should eat at my manger ,</l>
     <l n="29">From that awful moment the Church is in danger !</l>
     <l n="30">As , give them but stabling and shortly no stalls</l>
     <l n="31">Will suit their proud stomachs but those at St. Paul 's .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="32">The Doctor ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>and he , the devout man of Leather ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
     <l n="33">Vansittart , now laying their Saint-heads together ,</l>
     <l n="34">Declare that these skittish young abominations</l>
     <l n="35">Are clearly foretold in Chap . vi . Revelations —</l>
     <l n="36">Nay , they verily think they could point out the one</l>
     <l n="37">Which the Doctor 's friend Death was to canter upon .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="38">Lord Harrowby hoping that no one imputes</l>
     <l n="39">To the Court any fancy to persecute brutes ,</l>
     <l n="40">Protests on the word of himself and his cronies</l>
     <l n="41">That had these said creatures been Asses , not Ponies ,</l>
     <l n="42">The Court would have started no sort of objection ,</l>
     <l n="43">As Asses were , there , always sure of protection .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="44">“ If the Princess will keep them ( says Lord Castlereagh ) ,</l>
     <l n="45">“ To make them quite harmless , the only true way</l>
     <l n="46">“ Is ( as certain Chief Justices do with their wives )</l>
     <l n="47">“ To flog them within half an inch of their lives .</l>
     <l n="48">“ If they 've any bad Irish blood lurking about ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ This ( he knew by experience ) would soon draw it out . ”</l>
     <l n="50">Should this be thought cruel his Lordship proposes</l>
     <l n="51">“ The new Veto snaffle<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>to bind down their noses —</l>
     <l n="52">“ A pretty contrivance made out of old chains ,</l>
     <l n="53">“ Which appears to indulge while it doubly restrains ;</l>
     <l n="54">“ Which , however high-mettled , their gamesomeness checks</l>
     <l n="55">“ ( Adds his Lordship humanely ) , or else breaks their necks ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="56">This proposal received pretty general applause</l>
     <l n="57">From the Statesmen around-and the neck-breaking clause</l>
     <l n="58">Had a vigor about it , which soon reconciled</l>
     <l n="59">Even Eldon himself to a measure so mild .</l>
     <l n="60">So the snaffles , my dear , were agreed to nem . con .,</l>
     <l n="61">And my Lord Castlereagh , having so often shone</l>
     <l n="62">In the fettering line , is to buckle them on .</l>
     <l n="63">I shall drive to your door in these Vetoes some day ,</l>
     <l n="64">But , at present , adieu ! - I must hurry away</l>
     <l n="65">To go see my Mamma , as I 'm suffered to meet her</l>
     <l n="66">For just half an hour by the Queen 's best repeater .</l>

   <note>POSTSCRIPT . Before I send this scrawl away , I seize a moment just to say There 's some parts of the Turkish system So vulgar ‘ twere as well you missed ‘ em . For instance — in Seraglio matters — Your Turk whom girlish fondness flatters , Would fill his Haram ( tasteless fool ! ) With tittering , red-cheekt things from school . But here ( as in that fairy land , Where Love and Age went hand in hand ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Where lips , till sixty , shed no honey , And Grandams were worth any money ,) Our Sultan has much riper notions — So , let your list of she-promotions Include those only plump and sage , Who 've reached the regulation-age ; That is , ( as near as one can fix From Peerage dates ) full fifty-six . This rule 's for favorites — nothing more — For , as to wives , a Grand Signor , Tho ’ not decidedly without them , Need never care one curse about them .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ The truth indeed seems to be , that having lived so long abroad as evidently to have lost , in a great degree , the use of his native language , Mr. Leckie has gradually come not only to speak , but to feel , like a foreigner . ” — Edinburgh Review .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The learned Colonel must allude here to a description of the Mysterious Isle , in the History of Abdalla , Son of Hanif , where such inversions of the order of nature are said to have taken place .— “ A score of old women and the same number of old men played here and there in the court , some at chuck-farthing , others at tip-cat or at cockles . ” — And again , “ There is nothing , believe me , more engaging than those lovely wrinkles . ” — See “ Tales of the East , ” vol . iii . pp . 607 , 608 . LETTER III . FROM GEORGE PRINCE REGENT TO THE EARL OF YARMOUTH .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>We missed you last night at the “ hoary old sinner 's , ” Who gave us as usual the cream of good dinners ; His soups scientific , his fishes quite prime — His pâtés superb , and his cutlets sublime ! In short , ‘ twas the snug sort of dinner to stir a Stomachic orgasm in my Lord Ellenborough , Who set to , to be sure , with miraculous force , And exclaimed between mouthfuls , “ a He-Cook , of course !— “ While you live — ( what 's there under that cover ? pray , look ) — “ While you live — ( I 'll just taste it ) — ne'er keep a She-Cook . “ ‘ Tis a sound Salic Law — ( a small bit of that toast ) — “ Which ordains that a female shall ne'er rule the roast ; “ For Cookery 's a secret — ( this turtle 's uncommon ) — “ Like Masonry , never found out by a woman ! ” The dinner you know was in gay celebration Of my brilliant triumph and Hunt 's condemnation ; A compliment too to his Lordship the Judge For his Speech to the Jury — and zounds ! who would grudge Turtle soup tho ’ it came to five guineas a bowl , To reward such a loyal and complaisant soul ? We were all in high gig — Roman Punch and Tokay Travelled round till our heads travelled just the same way ; And we cared not for Juries or Libels — no — damme ! nor Even for the threats of last Sunday 's Examiner ! More good things were eaten than said — but Tom Tyrrhitt In quoting Joe Miller you know has some merit ; And hearing the sturdy Judiciary Chief Say — sated with turtle — “ I 'll now try the beef ” — Tommy whispered him ( giving his Lordship a sly hit ) “ I fear ‘ twill be hung-beef , my Lord , if you try it ! ” And Camden was there , who that morning had gone To fit his new Marquis 's coronet on ; And the dish set before him — oh ! dish well-devised !— Was what old Mother Glasse calls , “ a calf 's head surprised ! ” The brains were near Sherry and once had been fine , But of late they had lain so long soaking in wine , That tho ’ we from courtesy still chose to call These brains very fine they were no brains at all . When the dinner was over , we drank , every one In a bumper , “ the venial delights of Crim . Con . ; ” At which Headfort with warm reminiscences gloated , And Ellenb'rough chuckled to hear himself quoted . Our next round of toasts was a fancy quite new , For we drank — and you 'll own ‘ twas benevolent too — To those well-meaning husbands , cits , parsons or peers , Whom we 've any time honored by courting their dears : This museum of wittols was comical rather ; Old Headfort gave Massey , and I gave your father . In short , not a soul till this morning would budge — We were all fun and frolic , and even the Judge Laid aside for the time his juridical fashion , And thro ’ the whole night was n't once in a passion ! I write this in bed while my whiskers are airing , And Mac<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>has a sly dose of jalap preparing For poor Tommy Tyrrhitt at breakfast to quaff — As I feel I want something to give me a laugh , And there 's nothing so good as old Tommy kept close To his Cornwall accounts after taking a dose .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This letter , as the reader will perceive , was written the day after a dinner given by the Marquis of Headfort .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Colonel M'Mahon .

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>FROM THE RIGHT HON . PATRICK DUIGENAN TO THE RIGHT HON . SIR JOHN NICHOL . Last week , dear Nichol , making merry At dinner with our Secretary , When all were drunk or pretty near ( The time for doing business here ) , Says he to me , “ Sweet Bully Bottom ! “ These Papist dogs — hiccup — ‘ od rot ‘ em !— “ Deserve to be bespattered — hiccup — “ With all the dirt even you can pick up . “ But , as the Prince ( here 's to him — fill — “ Hip , hip , hurra ! ) — is trying still “ To humbug them with kind professions , “ And as you deal in strong expressions — “ Rogue ” — “ traitor ” — hiccup — and all that — “ You must be muzzled , Doctor Pat !— “ You must indeed — hiccup — that 's flat . ” — Yes — “ muzzled ” was the word Sir John — These fools have clapt a muzzle on The boldest mouth that e'er run o'er With slaver of the times of yore !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>— Was it for this that back I went As far as Lateran and Trent , To prove that they who damned us then Ought now in turn be damned again ? The silent victim still to sit Of Grattan 's fire and Canning 's wit , To hear even noisy Mathew gabble on , Nor mention once the Whore of Babylon ! Oh ! ‘ tis too much — who now will be The Nightman of No-Popery ? What Courtier , Saint or even Bishop Such learned filth will ever fish up ? If there among our ranks be one To take my place , ‘ tis thou , Sir John ; Thou who like me art dubbed Right Hon . Like me too art a Lawyer Civil That wishes Papists at the devil . To whom then but to thee , my friend , Should Patrick<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>his Port-folio send ? Take it — ‘ tis thine — his learned Port-folio , With all its theologic olio Of Bulls , half Irish and half Roman — Of Doctrines now believed by no man — Of Councils held for men 's salvation , Yet always ending in damnation — ( Which shows that since the world 's creation Your Priests , whate'er their gentle shamming , Have always had a taste for damning ,) And many more such pious scraps , To prove ( what we 've long proved , perhaps ,) That mad as Christians used to be About the Thirteenth Century , There still are Christians to be had In this , the Nineteenth , just as mad ! Farewell — I send with this , dear Nichol , A rod or two I 've had in pickle Wherewith to trim old Grattan 's jacket .— The rest shall go by Monday 's packet . P. D. Among the Enclosures in the foregoing Letter was the following “ Unanswerable Argument against the Papists . ” We 're told the ancient Roman nation Made use of spittle in lustration ; ( Vide “ Lactantium ap . Gallaeum "[ 3 ] — i. e. you need not read but see ‘ em ;) Now Irish Papists — fact surprising — Make use of spittle in baptizing ; Which proves them all , O'Finns , O'Fagans , Connors and Tooles all downright Pagans . This fact 's enough ; let no one tell us To free such sad , salivous fellows .— No , no — the man , baptized with spittle , Hath no truth in him — not a tittle !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In sending this sheet to the Press , however , I learn that the “ muzzle ” has been taken off , and the Right Hon . Doctor again let loose !<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>A bad name for poetry ; but Duigenan is still worse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>I have taken the trouble of examining the Doctor 's reference here , and find him for once correct . LETTER V. FROM THE COUNTESS DOWAGER OF CORK TO LADY — -  . My dear Lady — -  ! I 've been just sending out About five hundred cards for a snug little Rout — ( By the by , you 've seen “ Rokeby ” ?— this moment got mine — The “ Mail-Coach Edition ” — prodigiously fine ! ) But I can n't conceive how in this very cold weather I 'm ever to bring my five hundred together ; As , unless the thermometer 's near boiling heat , One can never get half of one 's hundreds to meet . ( Apropos — you 'd have thought to see Townsend last night , Escort to their chairs , with his staff , so polite , The “ three maiden Miseries , ” all in a fright ; Poor Townsend , like Mercury , filling two posts , Supervisor of thieves and chief-usher of ghosts ! ) But , my dear Lady ——, can n't you hit on some notion , At least for one night to set London in motion ?— As to having the Regent , that show is gone by — Besides , I 've remarkt that ( between you and I ) The Marchesa and he , inconvenient in more ways , Have taken much lately to whispering in doorways ; Which — considering , you know , dear , the size of the two — Makes a block that one 's company cannot get thro ’ ; And a house such as mine is , with door-ways so small , Has no room for such cumbersome love-work at all .— ( Apropos , tho ’ , of love-work — you 've heard it , I hope , That Napoleon 's old mother 's to marry the Pope ,— “ What a comical pair ! ) — but , to stick to my Rout , ‘ Twill be hard if some novelty can n't be struck out . Is there no Algerine , no Kamchatkan arrived ? No Plenipo Pacha , three-tailed and ten-wived ? No Russian whose dissonant consonant name Almost rattles to fragments the trumpet of fame ? I remember the time three or four winters back , When — provided their wigs were but decently black — A few Patriot monsters from Spain were a sight That would people one 's house for one , night after night . But — whether the Ministers pawed them too much — ( And you — know how they spoil whatsoever they touch ) Or , whether Lord George ( the young man about town ) Has by dint of bad poetry written them down . One has certainly lost one 's peninsular rage ; And the only stray Patriot seen for an age Has been at such places ( think , how the fit cools ! ) As old Mrs. Vaughan 's or Lord Liverpool 's . But , in short , my dear , names like Wintztschitstopschinzoudhoff Are the only things now make an evening go smooth off : So , get me a Russian — till death I 'm your debtor — If he brings the whole Alphabet , so much the better . And — Lord ! if he would but , in character , sup Off his fish-oil and candles , he 'd quite set me up ! Au revoir , my sweet girl — I must leave you in haste — Little Gunter has brought me the Liqueurs to taste . POSTSCRIPT . By the by , have you found any friend that can conster That Latin account , t'other day , of a Monster ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>If we can n't get a Russian , and that think in Latin Be not too improper , I think I 'll bring that in .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Alluding , I suppose , to the Latin Advertisement of a lusus Naturae in the Newspapers lately . LETTER VI . FROM ABDALLAH ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>IN LONDON , TO MOHASSAN , IN ISPAHAN .

    <head>APPENDIX .</head>
    <p n="1">LETTER IV . PAGE 584 .</p>
    <p n="2">Among the papers , enclosed in Dr. Duigenan 's Letter , was found an Heroic Epistle in Latin verse , from Pope Joan to her Lover , of which , as it is rather a curious document , I shall venture to give some account . This female Pontiff was a native of England , ( or , according to others of Germany ,) who at an early age disguised herself in male attire and followed her lover , a young ecclesiastic , to Athens where she studied with such effect that upon her arrival at Rome she was thought worthy of being raised to the Pontificate . This Epistle is addressed to her Lover ( whom she had elevated to the dignity of Cardinal ) , soon after the fatal accouchement , by which her Fallibility was betrayed .</p>
    <p n="3">She begins by reminding him tenderly of the time , when they were together at Athens — when , as she says ,</p>
    <p n="4">— “ by Ilissus ’ stream “ We whispering walkt along , and learned to speak “ The tenderest feelings in the purest Greek ; “ Ah ! then how little did we think or hope , “ Dearest of men , that I should e'er be Pope !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ That I , the humble Joan , whose housewife art “ Seemed just enough to keep thy house and heart , “ ( And those , alas ! at sixes and at sevens ,) “ Should soon keep all the keys of all the heavens ! ”</p>
    <p n="5">Still less ( she continues to say ) could they have foreseen , that such a catastrophe as had happened in Council would befall them — that she</p>
    <p n="6">“ Should thus surprise the Conclave 's grave decorum , “ And let a little Pope pop out before ‘ em — “ Pope Innocent ! alas , the only one “ That name could e'er be justly fixt upon . ”</p>
    <p n="7">She then very pathetically laments the downfall of her greatness , and enumerates the various treasures to which she is doomed to bid farewell forever :—</p>
    <p n="8">“ But oh , more dear , more precious ten times over — “ Farewell my Lord , my Cardinal , my Lover ! “ I made thee Cardinal — thou madest me — ah ! “ Thou madest the Papa of the world Mamma ! ”</p>
    <p n="9">I have not time at present to translate any more of this Epistle ; but I presume the argument which the Right Hon . Doctor and his friends mean to deduce from it , is ( in their usual convincing strain ) that Romanists must be unworthy of Emancipation now , because they had a Petticoat Pope in the Ninth Century . Nothing can be more logically clear , and I find that Horace had exactly the same views upon the subject .</p>
    <p n="10">Romanus ( eheu posteri negabitis ! ) emancipatus FOEMINAE fert vallum !</p>
    <p n="11"><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Spanheim attributes the unanimity with which Joan was elected to that innate and irresistible charm by which her sex , though latent , operated upon the instinct of the Cardinals .</p>
    <p n="12">LETTER VII . PAGE 588 .</p>
    <p n="13">The Manuscript , found enclosed in the Bookseller 's Letter , turns out to be a Melo-Drama , in two Acts , entitled “ The Book ,"[ 1 ] of which the Theatres , of course , had had the refusal , before it was presented to Messrs. Lackington and Co . This rejected Drama however possesses considerable merit and I shall take the liberty of laying a sketch of it before my Readers .</p>
    <p n="14">The first Act opens in a very awful manner — Time , three o'clock in the morning — Scene , the Bourbon Chamber<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>in Carleton House — Enter the Prince Regent solus — After a few broken sentences , he thus exclaims :—</p>
    <p n="15">Away — Away — Thou haunt'st my fancy so , thou devilish Book , I meet thee — trace thee , whereso'er I look . I see thy damned ink in Eldon 's brows — I see thy foolscap on my Hertford 's Spouse — Vansittart 's head recalls thy leathern case , And all thy blank-leaves stare from R — d — r 's face ! While , turning here ( laying his hand on his heart ,) I find , ah wretched elf , Thy List of dire Errata in myself . ( Walks the stage in considerable agitation . ) Oh Roman Punch ! oh potent Curaçoa ! Oh Mareschino ! Mareschino oh ! Delicious drams ! why have you not the art To kill this gnawing Book-worm in my heart ?</p>
    <p n="16">He is here interrupted in his Soliloquy by perceiving on the ground some scribbled fragments of paper , which he instantly collects , and “ by the light of two magnificent candelabras ” discovers the following unconnected words , “ Wife neglected ” — “ the Book ” — “ Wrong Measures ” — “ the Queen ” — “ Mr. Lambert ” — “ the Regent . ”</p>
    <p n="17">Ha ! treason in my house !— Curst words , that wither My princely soul , ( shaking the papers violently ) what Demon brought you hither ? “ My Wife ; ” — “ the Book ” too !— stay — a nearer look — ( holding the fragments closer to the Candelabras ) Alas ! too plain , B , double O , K , Book — Death and destruction !</p>
    <p n="18">He here rings all the bells , and a whole legion of valets enter . A scene of cursing and swearing ( very much in the German style ) ensues , in the course of which messengers are despatched , in different directions , for the Lord Chancellor , the Duke of Cumberland , etc . The intermediate time is filled up by another Soliloquy , at the conclusion of which the aforesaid Personages rush on alarmed ; the Duke with his stays only half-laced , and the Chancellor with his wig thrown hastily over an old red night-cap , “ to maintain the becoming splendor of his office . "[ 3 ] The Regent produces the appalling fragments , upon which the Chancellor breaks out into exclamations of loyalty and tenderness , and relates the following portentous dream :</p>
    <p n="19">‘ Tis scarcely two hours since I had a fearful dream of thee , my Prince !— Methought I heard thee midst a courtly crowd Say from thy throne of gold , in mandate loud , “ Worship my whiskers ! ” — ( weeps ) not a knee was there But bent and worshipt the Illustrious Pair , Which curled in conscious majesty ! ( pulls out his handkerchief ) — while cries Of “ Whiskers ; whiskers ! ” shook the echoing skies .— Just in that glorious hour , me-thought , there came , With looks of injured pride , a Princely Dame And a young maiden , clinging by her side , As if she feared some tyrant would divide Two hearts that nature and affection tied ! The Matron came — within her right hand glowed A radiant torch ; while from her left a load Of Papers hung — ( wipes his eyes ) collected in her veil — The venal evidence , the slanderous tale , The wounding hint , the current lies that pass From Post to Courier , formed the motley mass ; Which with disdain before the Throne she throws , And lights the Pile beneath thy princely nose .</p>
    <p n="20">( Weeps . )</p>
    <p n="21">Heavens , how it blazed !— I 'd ask no livelier fire , ( With animation ) To roast a Papist by , my gracious Sire !— But ah ! the Evidence — ( weeps again ) I mourned to see — Cast as it burned , a deadly light on thee : And Tales and Hints their random sparkles flung , And hissed and crackled , like an old maid 's tongue ; While Post and Courier , faithful to their fame , Made up in stink for what they lackt in flame . When , lo , ye Gods ! the fire ascending brisker , Now singes one now lights the other whisker . Ah ! where was then the Sylphid that unfurls Her fairy standard in defence of curls ? Throne , Whiskers , Wig soon vanisht into smoke , The watchman cried “ Past One , ” and — I awoke .</p>
    <p n="22">Here his Lordship weeps more profusely than ever , and the Regents ( who has been very much agitated during the recital of the Dream ) by a movement as characteristic as that of Charles XII . when he was shot , claps his hands to his whiskers to feel if all be really safe . A Privy Council is held — all the Servants , etc . are examined , and it appears that a Tailor , who had come to measure the Regent for a Dress ( which takes three whole pages of the best superfine clinquant in describing ) was the only person who had been in the Bourbon Chamber during the day . It is , accordingly , determined to seize the Tailor , and the Council breaks up with a unanimous resolution to be vigorous .</p>
    <p n="23">The commencement of the Second Act turns chiefly upon the Trial and Imprisonment of two Brothers<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>— but as this forms the under plot of the Drama , I shall content myself with extracting from it the following speech , which is addressed to the two Brothers , as they “ exeunt severally ” to Prison :—</p>
    <p n="24">Go to your prisons — tho ’ the air of Spring No mountain coolness to your cheeks shall bring ; Tho ’ Summer flowers shall pass unseen away , And all your portion of the glorious day May be some solitary beam that falls At morn or eve upon your dreary walls — Some beam that enters , trembling as if awed , To tell how gay the young world laughs abroad ! Yet go — for thoughts as blessed as the air Of Spring or Summer flowers await you there ; Thoughts such as He who feasts his courtly crew In rich conservatories never knew ; Pure self-esteem — the smiles that light within — The Zeal , whose circling charities begin With the few loved-ones Heaven has placed it near , And spread till all Mankind are in its sphere ; The Pride that suffers without vaunt or plea . And the fresh Spirit that can warble free Thro ’ prison-bars its hymn to Liberty !</p>
    <p n="25">The Scene next changes to a Tailor 's Workshop , and a fancifully-arranged group of these Artists is discovered upon the Shop-board — Their task evidently of a royal nature , from the profusion of gold-lace , frogs , etc ., that lie about — They all rise and come forward , while one of them sings the following Stanzas to the tune of “ Derry Down . ”</p>
    <p n="26">My brave brother Tailors , come , straighten your knees , For a moment , like gentlemen , stand up at ease , While I sing of our Prince ( and a fig for his railers ) , The Shop-board 's delight ! the Maecenas of Tailors ! Derry down , down , down derry down .</p>
    <p n="27">Some monarchs take roundabout ways into note , While His short cut to fame is — the cut of his coat ; Philip 's Son thought the World was too small for his Soul , But our Regent 's finds room in a laced button-hole . Derry down , etc .</p>
    <p n="28">Look thro ’ all Europe 's Kings — those , at least , who go loose — Not a King of them all 's such a friend to the Goose . So , God keep him increasing in size and renown , Still the fattest and best fitted Prince about town ! Derry down , etc .</p>
    <p n="29">During the “ Derry down ” of this last verse , a messenger from the Secretary of State 's Office rushes on , and the singer ( who , luckily for the effect of the scene , is the very Tailor suspected of the mysterious fragments ) is interrupted in the midst of his laudatory exertions and hurried away , to the no small surprise and consternation of his comrades . The Plot now hastens rapidly in its development — the management of the Tailor 's examination is highly skilful , and the alarm which he is made to betray is natural without being ludicrous . The explanation too which he finally gives is not more simple than satisfactory . It appears that the said fragments formed part of a self-exculpatory note , which he had intended to send to Colonel M'Mahon upon subjects purely professional , and the corresponding bits ( which still lie luckily in his pocket ) being produced and skilfully laid beside the others , the following billet-doux is the satisfactory result of their juxtaposition ,</p>
    <p n="30">Honored Colonel — my Wife , who 's the Queen of all slatterns , Neglected to put up the Book of new Patterns . She sent the wrong Measures too — shamefully wrong — They 're the same used for poor Mr. Lambert , when young ; But , bless you ! they wouldn  t go half round the Regent — So , hope you 'll excuse yours till death , most obedient .</p>
    <p n="31">This fully explains the whole mystery — the Regent resumes his wonted smiles , and the Drama terminates as usual to the satisfaction of all parties .</p>
    <p n="32"><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>There was , in like manner , a mysterious Book , in the 16th Century , which employed all the anxious curiosity of the Learned of that time . Every one spoke of it ; many wrote against it ; though it does not appear that anybody had ever seen it ; and Grotius is of opinion that no such Book ever existed . It was entitled , “ Liber de tribus impostoribus . ” ( See Morhof . Cap . “ de Libris damnatis . ” )</p>

    <p n="38">A DREAM .</p>
    <p n="39">“ It would be impossible for his Royal Highness to disengage his person from the accumulating pile of papers that encompassed it . ” — Lord CASTLEREAGH 'S Speech upon Colonel M Mahon 's Appointment , April 14 , 1812 .</p>
    <p n="40">Last night I tost and turned in bed , But could not sleep — at length I said , “ I 'll think of Viscount Castlereagh , “ And of his speeches — that 's the way . ” And so it was , for instantly I slept as sound as sound could be . And then I dreamt — so dread a dream ! Fuseli has no such theme ; Lewis never wrote or borrowed Any horror half so horrid !</p>
    <p n="41">Methought the Prince in whiskered state Before me at his breakfast sate ; On one side lay unread Petitions , On t'other , Hints from five Physicians ! Here tradesmen 's bills ,— official papers , Notes from my Lady , drams for vapors There plans of Saddles , tea and toast . Death-warrants and The Morning Post .</p>
    <p n="42">When lo ! the Papers , one and all . As if at some magician 's call . Began to flutter of themselves From desk and table , floor and shelves , And , cutting each some different capers , Advanced , oh jacobinic papers ! As tho ’ they said , “ Our sole design is “ To suffocate his Royal Highness ! ” The Leader of this vile sedition Was a huge Catholic Petition , With grievances so full and heavy , It threatened worst of all the bevy ; Then Common-Hall Addresses came In swaggering sheets and took their aim Right at the Regent 's well-drest head , As if determined to be read . Next Tradesmen 's bills began to fly , And Tradesmen 's bills , we know , mount high ; Nay even Death-warrants thought they 'd best Be lively too and join the rest .</p>
    <p n="43">But , oh the basest of defections ! His letter about “ predilections ” !— His own dear letter , void of grace , Now flew up in its parent 's face ! Shocked with this breach of filial duty , He just could murmur “ et Tu Brute ? ” Then sunk , subdued upon the floor At Fox 's bust , to rise no more !</p>
    <p n="44">I waked — and prayed , with lifted hand , “ Oh ! never may this Dream prove true ; “ Tho ’ paper overwhelms the land , “ Let it not crush the Sovereign , too ! ”</p>

No !— far were such dreams of improvement from me : And it pleased me to find , at the House , where , you know ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>There 's such good mutton cutlets , and strong curaçoa ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>That the Marchioness called me a duteous old boy , And my Yarmouth 's red whiskers grew redder for joy .</p>
    <p n="52">You know , my dear Freddy , how oft , if I would , By the law of last sessions I might have done good . I might have withheld these political noodles From knocking their heads against hot Yankee Doodles ; I might have told Ireland I pitied her lot , Might have soothed her with hope — but you know I did not .</p>
    <p n="53">And my wish is , in truth , that the best of old fellows Should not , on recovering , have cause to be jealous , But find that while he has been laid on the shelf We 've been all of us nearly as mad as himself . You smile at my hopes — but the Doctors and I Are the last that can think the King ever will die .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></p>
    <p n="54">A new era 's arrived<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>— tho ’ you 'd hardly believe it — And all things of course must be new to receive it . New villas , new fêtes ( which even Waithman attends ) — New saddles , new helmets , and — why not new friends ?</p>
    <p n="55">I repeat it , “ New Friends ” — for I cannot describe The delight I am in with this Perceval tribe . Such capering !— Such vaporing !— Such rigor !— Such vigor ! North , South , East , and West , they have cut such a figure , That soon they will bring the whole world round our ears , And leave us no friends — but Old Nick and Algiers .</p>
    <p n="56">When I think of the glory they 've beamed on my chains , ‘ Tis enough quite to turn my illustrious brains . It is true we are bankrupts in commerce and riches , But think how we find our Allies in new breeches ! We 've lost the warm hearts of the Irish , ‘ tis granted , But then we 've got Java , an island much wanted , To put the last lingering few who remain , Of the Walcheren warriors , out of their pain . Then how Wellington fights ! and how squabbles his brother ! For Papists the one and with Papists the other ; One crushing Napoleon by taking a City , While t'other lays waste a whole Catholic Committee . Oh deeds of renown !— shall I boggle or flinch , With such prospects before me ? by Jove , not an inch . No — let England 's affairs go to rack , if they will , We 'll look after the affairs of the Continent still ; And with nothing at home but starvation and riot , Find Lisbon in bread and keep Sicily quiet .</p>
    <p n="57">I am proud to declare I have no predilections ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>My heart is a sieve where some scattered affections Are just danced about for a moment or two , And the finer they are , the more sure to run thro ’ ; Neither feel I resentments , nor wish there should come ill To mortal — except ( now I think o n't ) Beau Brummel , Who threatened last year , in a superfine passion , To cut me and bring the old King into fashion . This is all I can lay to my conscience at present ; When such is my temper , so neutral , so pleasant , So royally free from all troublesome feelings , So little encumbered by faith in my dealings ( And that I 'm consistent the world will allow , What I was at Newmarket the same I am now ) . When such are my merits ( you know I hate cracking ) , I hope , like the Vender of Best Patent Blacking , “ To meet with the generous and kind approbation “ Of a candid , enlightened , and liberal nation . ”</p>
    <p n="58">By the by , ere I close this magnificent Letter , ( No man , except Pole , could have writ you a better ,) ‘ Twould please me if those , whom I 've humbugged so long<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>With the notion ( good men ! ) that I knew right from wrong , Would a few of them join me — mind , only a few — To let too much light in on me never would do ; But even Grey 's brightness sha n't make me afraid , While I 've Camden and Eldon to fly to for shade ; Nor will Holland 's clear intellect do us much harm , While there 's Westmoreland near him to weaken the charm . As for Moira 's high spirit , if aught can subdue it . Sure joining with Hertford and Yarmouth will do it ! Between R-d-r and Wharton let Sheridan sit , And the fogs will soon quench even Sheridan 's wit : And against all the pure public feeling that glows Even in Whitbread himself we 've a Host in George Rose ! So in short if they wish to have Places , they may , And I 'll thank you to tell all these matters to Grey .<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>Who , I doubt not , will write ( as there 's no time to lose ) By the twopenny post to tell Grenville the news ; And now , dearest Fred ( tho ’ I 've no predilection ) , Believe me yours always with truest affection .</p>

    <p n="100">King Crack was the best of all possible Kings , ( At least , so his Courtiers would swear to you gladly ,) But Crack now and then would do heterodox things , And at last took to worshipping Images sadly .</p>
    <p n="101">Some broken-down Idols , that long had been placed In his father 's old Cabinet , pleased him so much , That he knelt down and worshipt , tho ’ — such was his taste !— They were monstrous to look at and rotten to touch .</p>
    <p n="102">And these were the beautiful Gods of King Crack !— But his People disdaining to worship such things Cried aloud , one and all , “ Come , your Godships must pack — “ You 'll not do for us , tho ’ you may do for Kings . ”</p>
    <p n="103">Then trampling these images under their feet , They sent Crack a petition , beginning “ Great Caesar ! “ We 're willing to worship ; but only entreat “ That you 'll find us some decenter godheads than these are . ”</p>
    <p n="104">“ I 'll try , ” says King Crack — so they furnisht him models Of better shaped Gods but he sent them all back ; Some were chiselled too fine , some had heads stead of noddles , In short they were all much too godlike for Crack .</p>
    <p n="105">So he took to his darling old Idols again , And just mending their legs and new bronzing their faces , In open defiance of Gods and of man , Set the monsters up grinning once more in their places .</p>

OCCASIONAL ADDRESS FOR THE OPENING OF THE NEW THEATRE OF ST. STEPHEN , INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY THE PROPRIETOR IN FULL COSTUME , ON THE 24TH OF NOVEMBER , 1812 . This day a New House for your edification We open , most thinking and right-headed nation ! Excuse the materials — tho ’ rotten and bad , They 're the best that for money just now could be had ; And if echo the charm of such houses should be , You will find it shall echo my speech to a T. As for actors , we 've got the old Company yet , The same motley , odd , tragicomical set ; And considering they all were but clerks t'other day , It is truly surprising how well they can play . Our Manager ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>( he who in Ulster was nurst , And sung Erin go Bragh for the galleries first , But on finding Pitt-interest a much better thing , Changed his note of a sudden to God save the King ,) Still wise as he 's blooming and fat as he 's clever , Himself and his speeches as lengthy as ever . Here offers you still the full use of his breath , Your devoted and long-winded proser till death . You remember last season , when things went perverse on . We had to engage ( as a block to rehearse on ) One Mr. Vansittart , a good sort of person , Who 's also employed for this season to play , In “ Raising the Wind , ” and “ the Devil to Pay . "[ 2 ] We expect too — at least we 've been plotting and planning — To get that great actor from Liverpool , Canning ; And , as at the Circus there 's nothing attracts Like a good single combat brought in ‘ twixt the acts , If the Manager should , with the help of Sir Popham , Get up new diversions and Canning should stop ‘ em , Who knows but we 'll have to announce in the papers , “ Grand fight — second time — with additional capers . ” Be your taste for the ludicrous , humdrum , or sad , There is plenty of each in this House to be had . Where our Manager ruleth , there weeping will be , For a dead hand at tragedy always was he ; And there never was dealer in dagger and cup , Who so smilingly got all his tragedies up . His powers poor Ireland will never forget , And the widows of Walcheren weep o'er them yet . So much for the actors ;— for secret machinery , Traps , and deceptions , and shifting of scenery , Yarmouth and Cum are the best we can find , To transact all that trickery business behind . The former 's employed too to teach us French jigs , Keep the whiskers in curl and look after the wigs . In taking my leave now , I 've only to say , A few Seats in the House , not as yet sold away , May be had of the Manager , Pat Castlereagh .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Lord Castlereagh .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>He had recently been appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer .

What tool is there job after job will not hack ? Their edge is but dullish it must be confest , And their temper , like Ellenborough 's , none of the best ; But you 'll find them good hardworking Tools , upon trying , Were't but for their brass they are well worth the buying ; They 're famous for making blinds , sliders , and screens , And are some of them excellent turning machines . The first Tool I 'll put up ( they call it a Chancellor ) , Heavy concern to both purchaser and seller .

    <p>DEDICATED TO THE RT . HON . CHARLES ABBOT . arcades ambo et cantare pares 1813 . There was a little Man and he had a little Soul , And he said , “ Little Soul , let us try , try , try . “ Whether it 's within our reach “ To make up a little Speech , “ Just between little you and little I , I , I , “ Just between little you and little I ! ” Then said his little Soul , Peeping from her little hole , “ I protest , little Man , you are stout , stout , stout , “ But , if it 's not uncivil , “ Pray tell me what the devil , “ Must our little , little speech be about , bout , bout , “ Must our little , little speech be about ? ” The little Man lookt big , With the assistance of his wig , And he called his little Soul to order , order , order , Till she feared he 'd make her jog in To jail , like Thomas Croggan , ( As she was n't Duke or Earl ) to reward her , ward her , ward her , As she was n't Duke or Earl , to reward her . The little Man then spoke , “ Little Soul , it is no joke , “ For as sure as Jacky Fuller loves a sup , sup , sup , “ I will tell the Prince and People “ What I think of Church and Steeple . “ And my little patent plan to prop them up , up , up , “ And my little patent plan to prop them up . ” Away then , cheek by jowl , Little Man and little Soul Went and spoke their little speech to a tittle , tittle , tittle , And the world all declare That this priggish little pair Never yet in all their lives lookt so little , little , little . Never yet in all their lives lookt so little ! REINFORCEMENTS FOR LORD WELLINGTON . suosque tibi commendat , Troja Penates hos cape fatorum comites . VERGIL . 1813 . As recruits in these times are not easily got And the Marshal must have them — pray , why should we not , As the last and , I grant it , the worst of our loans to him , Ship off the Ministry , body and bones to him ? There 's not in all England , I 'd venture to swear , Any men we could half so conveniently spare ; And tho ’ they 've been helping the French for years past , We may thus make them useful to England at last . Castlereagh in our sieges might save some disgraces , Being used to the taking and keeping of places ; And Volunteer Canning , still ready for joining , Might show off his talent for sly under-mining . Could the Household but spare us its glory and pride , Old Headfort at horn-works again might be tried , And as Chief Justice make a bold charge at his side : While Vansittart could victual the troops upon tick , And the Doctor look after the baggage and sick . Nay , I do not see why the great Regent himself Should in times such as these stay at home on the shelf : Tho ’ thro ’ narrow defiles he 's not fitted to pass , Yet who could resist , if he bore down en masse ? And tho ’ oft of an evening perhaps he might prove , Like our Spanish confederates , “ unable to move ,"[ 1 ] Yet there 's one thing in war of advantage unbounded , Which is , that he could not with ease be surrounded . In my next I shall sing of their arms and equipment : At present no more , but — good luck to the shipment !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The character given to the Spanish soldier , in Sir John Murray 's memorable despatch .

LORD WELLINGTON AND THE MINISTERS . 1813 . So gently in peace Alcibiades smiled , While in battle he shone forth so terribly grand , That the emblem they graved on his seal , was a child With a thunderbolt placed in its innocent hand . Oh Wellington , long as such Ministers wield Your magnificent arm , the same emblem will do ; For while they 're in the Council and you in the Field . We 've the babies in them , and the thunder in you ! The following trifles , having enjoyed in their circulation through the newspapers all the celebrity and length of life to which they were entitled , would have been suffered to pass quietly into oblivion without pretending to any further distinction , had they not already been published , in a collective form , both in London and Paris , and , in each case , been mixed up with a number of other productions , to which , whatever may be their merit , the author of the following pages has no claim . A natural desire to separate his own property , worthless as it is , from that of others , is , he begs to say , the chief motive of the publication of this volume .

Sir Hudson Lowe , Sir Hudson Low , ( By name , and ah ! by nature so ) As thou art fond of persecutions , Perhaps thou'st read , or heard repeated , How Captain Gulliver was treated , When thrown among the Lilliputians . They tied him down — these little men did — And having valiantly ascended Upon the Mighty Man 's protuberance , They did so strut !— upon my soul , It must have been extremely droll To see their pigmy pride 's exuberance ! And how the doughty mannikins Amused themselves with sticking pins And needles in the great man 's breeches : And how some very little things , That past for Lords , on scaffoldings Got up and worried him with speeches , Alas , alas ! that it should happen To mighty men to be caught napping !— Tho ’ different too these persecutions ; For Gulliver , there , took the nap , While , here , the Nap , oh sad mishap , Is taken by the Lilliputians ! AMATORY COLLOQUY BETWEEN BANK AND GOVERNMENT . 1826 . BANK . Is all then forgotten ? those amorous pranks You and I in our youth , my dear Government , played ; When you called me the fondest , the truest of Banks , And enjoyed the endearing advances I made ! When left to ourselves , unmolested and free , To do all that a dashing young couple should do , A law against paying was laid upon me , But none against owing , dear helpmate , on you . And is it then vanisht ?— that “ hour ( as Othello So happily calls it ) of Love and Direction ? ” And must we , like other fond doves , my dear fellow , Grow good in our old age and cut the connection ? GOVERNMENT . Even so , my beloved Mrs. Bank , it must be ; This paying in cash plays the devil with wooing : We 've both had our swing , but I plainly foresee There must soon be a stop to our billing and cooing . Propagation in reason — a small child or two — Even Reverend Malthus himself is a friend to ; The issue of some folks is moderate and few — But ours , my dear corporate Bank , there 's no end to !

Said a Sovereign to a Note , In the pocket of his coat , Where they met in a neat purse of leather , “ How happens it , I prithee , “ That , tho ’ I 'm wedded with thee , “ Fair Pound , we can never live together ? “ Like your sex , fond of change “ With Silver you can range , “ And of lots of young sixpences be mother ; “ While with me — upon my word , “ Not my Lady and my Lord “ Of Westmouth see so little of each other ! ” The indignant Note replied ( Lying crumpled by his side ) , “ Shame , shame , it is yourself that roam , Sir — “ One cannot look askance , “ But , whip ! you 're off to France , “ Leaving nothing but old rags at home , Sir . “ Your scampering began “ From the moment Parson Van , “ Poor man , made us one in Love 's fetter ; “ ‘ For better or for worse ’ “ Is the usual marriage curse , “ But ours is all ‘ worse ’ and no ‘ better . ’ “ In vain are laws past , “ There 's nothing holds you fast , “ Tho ’ you know , sweet Sovereign , I adore you — “ At the smallest hint in life , “ You forsake your lawful wife , “ As other Sovereigns did before you . “ I flirt with Silver , true — “ But what can ladies do , “ When disowned by their natural protectors ? “ And as to falsehood , stuff ! “ I shall soon be false enough , “ When I get among those wicked Bank Directors . ” The Sovereign , smiling on her , Now swore upon his honor , To be henceforth domestic and loyal ; But , within an hour or two , Why — I sold him to a Jew , And he 's now at No . 10 , Palais Royal .

As to weavers , no matter how poorly they feast ; But Peers and such animals , fed up for show , ( Like the well-physickt elephant , lately deceased ,) Take a wonderful quantum of cramming , you know .

When Rome was uproarious , her knowing patricians Made “ Bread and the Circus ” a cure for each row ; But not so the plan of our noble physicians , “ No Bread and the Treadmill ,"' s the regimen now .

My banks are all furnisht with rags , So thick , even Freddy can n't thin ‘ em ; I 've torn up my old money-bags , Having little or nought to put in ‘ em .

As sages the matter explain ;— Bob owes it to Tom , and then Tommy Just owes it to Bob back again . Since all have thus taken to owing , There 's nobody left that can pay ; And this is the way to keep going ,— All quite in the family way . My senators vote away millions , To put in Prosperity 's budget ; And tho ’ it were billions or trillions , The generous rogues wouldn  t grudge it . ‘ Tis all but a family hop , ‘ Twas Pitt began dancing the hay ; Hands round !— why the deuce should we stop ? ‘ Tis all in the family way .

But cheer up , John , Sawney , and Paddy , The King is your father , they say ; So even if you starve for your Daddy , ‘ Tis all in the family way . My rich manufacturers tumble , My poor ones have nothing to chew ; And even if themselves do not grumble Their stomachs undoubtedly do . But coolly to fast en famille , Is as good for the soul as to pray ; And famine itself is genteel , When one starves in a family way . I have found out a secret for Freddy , A secret for next Budget day ; Tho ’ perhaps he may know it already , As he too 's a sage in his way . When next for the Treasury scene he Announces “ the Devil to pay , ” Let him write on the bills , “ nota bene , “ ‘ Tis all in the family way . ” BALLAD FOR THE CAMBRIDGE ELECTION . “ I authorized my Committee to take the step which they did , of proposing a fair comparison of strength , upon the understanding that whichever of the two should prove to be the weakest , should give way to the other . ” — Extract from Mr. W.

Yes , Sleeper of Ages , thou shalt be their chosen ; And deeply with thee will they sorrow , good men , To think that all Europe has , since thou wert frozen , So altered thou hardly wilt know it again . And Eldon will weep o'er each sad innovation Such oceans of tears , thou wilt fancy that he Has been also laid up in a long congelation , And is only now thawing , dear Roger , like thee .

Well knowing how dear were those times to thy soul , When every good Christian tormented his brother , And caused , in thy realm , such a saving of coal , From all coming down , ready grilled by each other ; Remembering besides how it pained thee to part With the old Penal Code — that chef-d'oeuvre of Law , In which ( tho ’ to own it too modest thou art ) We could plainly perceive the fine touch of thy claw ; I thought , as we ne'er can those good times revive , ( Tho ’ Eldon , with help from your Highness would try ,) ‘ Twould still keep a taste for Hell 's music alive , Could we get up a thundering No-Popery cry ;— That yell which when chorused by laics and clerics , So like is to ours , in its spirit and tone . That I often nigh laugh myself into hysterics , To think that Religion should make it her own . So , having sent down for the original notes Of the chorus as sung by your Majesty 's choir With a few pints of lava to gargle the throats Of myself and some others who sing it “ with fire ,"[ 1 ] Thought I , “ if the Marseillais Hymn could command “ Such audience , tho ’ yelled by a Sans-culotte crew “ What wonders shall we do , who 've men in our band , “ That not only wear breeches but petticoats too . ” Such then were my hopes , but with sorrow , your Highness , I 'm forced to confess — be the cause what it will , Whether fewness of voices or hoarseness or shyness ,— Our Beelzebub Chorus has gone off but ill . The truth is no placeman now knows his right key , The Treasury pitch-pipe of late is so various ; And certain base voices , that lookt for a fee At the York music-meeting now think it precarious . Even some of our Reverends might have been warmer ,— Tho ’ one or two capital roarers we 've had ; Doctor Wise<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>is for instance a charming performer , And Huntingdon Maberley 's yell was not bad ! Altogether however the thing was not hearty ;— Even Eldon allows we got on but so so ; And when next we attempt a No-Popery party , We must , please your Highness , recruit from below . But hark ! the young Black-leg is cracking his whip — Excuse me , Great Sir-there 's no time to be civil ;— The next opportunity sha n't be let slip , But , till then , I 'm , in haste , your most dutiful DEVIL . July , 1826<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Con fuoco — a music-book direction .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>This reverend gentleman distinguished himself at the Reading election . THE MILLENNIUM . SUGGESTED BY THE LATE WORK OF THE REVEREND MR. IRVING “ ON PROPHECY . ” 1826 A millennium at hand !— I 'm delighted to hear it — As matters both public and private now go , With multitudes round us all starving or near it . A good , rich Millennium will come à-propos . Only think , Master Fred , what delight to behold , Instead of thy bankrupt old City of Rags , A bran-new Jerusalem built all of gold , Sound bullion throughout from the roof to the flags — A City where wine and cheap corn<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>shall abound — A celestial Cocaigne on whose buttery shelves We may swear the best things of this world will be found , As your Saints seldom fail to take care of themselves ! Thanks , reverend expounder of raptures Elysian , Divine Squintifobus who , placed within reach Of two opposite worlds , by a twist of your vision Can cast at the same time a sly look at each ;— Thanks , thanks for the hope thou affordest , that we May even in our own times a Jubilee share . Which so long has been promist by prophets like thee , And so often postponed , we began to despair . There was Whiston<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>who learnedly took Prince Eugene For the man who must bring the Millennium about ; There 's Faber whose pious productions have been All belied ere his book 's first edition was out ;— There was Counsellor Dobbs , too , an Irish M. P ., Who discoursed on the subject with signal eclat , And , each day of his life sat expecting to see A Millennium break out in the town of Armagh !<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>There was also — but why should I burden my lay With your Brotherses , Southcotes , and names less deserving , When all past Millenniums henceforth must give way To the last new Millennium of Orator Irving . Go on , mighty man ,— doom them all to the shelf ,— And when next thou with Prophecy troublest thy sconce , Oh forget not , I pray thee , to prove that thyself Art the Beast ( Chapter iv . ) that sees nine ways at once .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny . ” — Rev . vi .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>When Whiston presented to Prince Eugene the Essay in which he attempted to connect his victories over the Turks with Revelation , the Prince is said to have replied , that “ he was not aware he had ever had ever had honor of being known to St. John ” .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Mr. Dobbs was a member of the Irish Parliament , and , on all other subjects but the Millennium , a very sensible person : he chose Armagh as the scene of his Millennium on account of the name Armageddon mentioned in Revelation . THE THREE DOCTORS . doctoribus loetamur tribus . 1826 . Tho ’ many great Doctors there be , There are three that all Doctors out-top , Doctor Eady , that famous M. D ., Doctor Southey , and dear Doctor Slop .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The purger , the proser , the bard — All quacks in a different style ; Doctor Southey writes books by the yard . Doctor Eady writes puffs by the mile !<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Doctor Slop , in no merit outdone By his scribbling or physicking brother , Can dose us with stuff like the one . Ay , and doze us with stuff like the other . Doctor Eady good company keeps With “ No Popery ” scribes , on the walls ; Doctor Southey as gloriously sleeps With “ No Popery ” scribes on the stalls . Doctor Slop , upon subjects divine , Such bedlamite slaver lets drop , Taat if Eady should take the mad line , He 'll be sure of a patient in Slop . Seven millions of Papists , no less , Doctor Southey attacks , like a Turk ; Doctor Eady , less bold , I confess , Attacks but his maid-of-all-work Doctor Southey , for his grand attack , Both a laureate and pensioner is ; While poor Doctor Eady , alack , Has been had up to Bow-street for his ! And truly , the law does so blunder , That tho ’ little blood has been spilt , he May probably suffer as , under The Chalking Act , known to be guilty . So much for the merits sublime ( With whose catalogue ne'er should I stop ) Of the three greatest lights of our time , Doctor Eady and Southey and Slop ! Should you ask me , to which of the three Great Doctors the preference should fall , As a matter of course I agree Doctor Eady must go to the wall . But as Southey with laurels is crowned , And Slop with a wig and a tail is , Let Eady 's bright temples be bound With a swingeing “ Corona Muralis ! "[ 3 ]<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The editor of the Morning Herald , so nicknamed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Alluding to the display of this doctor 's name , in chalk , on all the walls round the metropolis .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>A crown granted as a reward among the Romans to persons who performed any extraordinary exploits upon wall , such as scaling them , battering them , etc .— No doubt , writing upon them , to the extent Dr. Eady does , would equally establish a claim to the honor . EPITAPH ON A TUFT-HUNTER . Lament , lament , Sir Isaac Heard , Put mourning round thy page , Debrett , For here lies one who ne'er preferred A Viscount to a Marquis yet . Beside him place the God of Wit , Before him Beauty 's rosiest girls , Apollo for a star he 'd quit , And Love 's own sister for an Earl 's . Did niggard fate no peers afford , He took of course to peers ’ relations ; And rather than not sport a Lord Put up with even the last creations ; Even Irish names could he but tag ‘ em With “ Lord ” and “ Duke , ” were sweet to call ; And at a pinch Lord Ballyraggum Was better than no Lord at all . Heaven grant him now some noble nook , For rest his soul ! he 'd rather be Genteelly damned beside a Duke , Than saved in vulgar company . ODE TO A HAT . — altum aedificat caput . ” JUVENAL 1826 . Hail , reverent Hat !— sublime mid all The minor felts that round thee grovel ;— Thou that the Gods “ a Delta ” call While meaner mortals call the “ shovel . ” When on thy shape ( like pyramid , Cut horizontally in two )[ 1 ] I raptured gaze , what dreams unbid Of stalls and mitres bless my view ! That brim of brims so sleekly good — Not flapt , like dull Wesleyans ’ , down , But looking ( as all churchmen 's should ) Devoutly upward — towards the crown . Gods ! when I gaze upon that brim , So redolent of Church all over , What swarms of Tithes in vision dim ,— Some-pig-tailed , some like cherubim , With ducklings ’ wings — around it hover ! Tenths of all dead and living things , That Nature into being brings , From calves and corn to chitterlings . Say , holy Hat , that hast , of cocks , The very cock most orthodox . To which of all the well-fed throng Of Zion ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>joy'st thou to belong ? Thou'rt not Sir Harcourt Lees 's — no - For hats grow like the heads that wear ‘ em : And hats , on heads like his , would grow Particularly harum-scarum . Who knows but thou mayst deck the pate Of that famed Doctor Ad-mth-te , ( The reverend rat , whom we saw stand On his hind-legs in Westmoreland ,) Who changed so quick from blue to yellow , And would from yellow back to blue , And back again , convenient fellow , If ‘ twere his interest so to do . Or haply smartest of triangles , Thou art the hat of Doctor Owen ; The hat that , to his vestry wrangles , That venerable priest doth go in ,— And then and there amid the stare Of all St. Olave 's , takes the chair And quotes with phiz right orthodox The example of his reverend brothers , To prove that priests all fleece their flocks And he must fleece as well as others . Blest Hat ! ( whoe'er thy lord may be ) Thus low I take off mine to thee , The homage of a layman 's castor , To the spruce delta of his pastor . Oh mayst thou be , as thou proceedest , Still smarter cockt , still brusht the brighter , Till , bowing all the way , thou leadest Thy sleek possessor to a mitre !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>So described by a Reverend Historian of the Church :— “ A Delta hat like the horizontal section of a pyramid . ” — GRANT 'S “ History of the English Church . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Archbishop Magee affectionately calls the Church Establishment of Ireland “ the little Zion . ” NEWS FOR COUNTRY COUSINS . Dear Coz , as I know neither you nor Miss Draper , When Parliament 's up , ever take in a paper , But trust for your news to such stray odds and ends As you chance to pick up from political friends - Being one of this well-informed class , I sit down To transmit you the last newest news that 's in town . As to Greece and Lord Cochrane , things could n't look better — His Lordship ( who promises now to fight faster ) Has just taken Rhodes and despatched off a letter To Daniel O'Connell , to make him Grand Master ; Engaging to change the old name , if he can , From the Knights of St. John to the Knights of St. Dan ;— Or if Dan should prefer ( as a still better whim ) Being made the Colossus , ‘ tis all one to him . From Russia the last accounts are that the Tsar — Most generous and kind as all sovereigns are , And whose first princely act ( as you know , I suppose ) Was to give away all his late brother 's old clothes<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>— Is now busy collecting with brotherly care The late Emperor 's nightcaps , and thinks , of bestowing One nightcap apiece ( if he has them to spare ) On all the distinguisht old ladies now going . ( While I write , an arrival from Riga — the “ Brothers ” — Having nightcaps on board for Lord Eldon and others . ) Last advices from India — Sir Archy , ‘ tis thought , Was near catching a Tartar ( the first ever caught In N. Lat . 2l . ) — and his Highness Burmese , Being very hard prest to shell out the rupees , And not having rhino sufficient , they say , meant To pawn his august Golden Foot<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>for the payment . ( How lucky for monarchs , that thus when they choose Can establish a running account with the Jews ! ) The security being what Rothschild calls “ goot , ” A loan will be shortly , of course , set on foot ; The parties are Rothschild , A. Baring and Co. With three other great pawnbrokers : each takes a toe , And engages ( lest Gold-foot should give us leg-bail , As he did once before ) to pay down on the nail . This is all for the present — what vile pens and paper ! Yours truly , dear Cousin — best love to Miss Draper .

    <p>BY THE AUTHOR OF “ CHRISTABEL . ” “ Up ! ” said the Spirit and ere I could pray One hasty orison , whirled me away To a Limbo , lying — I wist not where — Above or below , in earth or air ; For it glimmered o'er with a doubtful light , One could n't say whether ‘ twas day or night ; And ‘ twas crost by many a mazy track , One did n't know how to get on or back ; And I felt like a needle that 's going astray ( With its one eye out ) thro ’ a bundle of hay ; When the Spirit he grinned , and whispered me , “ Thou'rt now in the Court of Chancery ! ” Around me flitted unnumbered swarms Of shapeless , bodiless , tailless forms ; ( Like bottled-up babes that grace the room Of that worthy knight , Sir Everard Home ) — All of them , things half-killed in rearing ; Some were lame — some wanted hearing ; Some had thro ’ half a century run , Tho ’ they had n't a leg to stand upon . Others , more merry , as just beginning , Around on a point of law were spinning ; Or balanced aloft , ‘ twixt Bill and Answer , Lead at each end , like a tight-rope dancer . Some were so cross that nothing could please ‘ em ; -  Some gulpt down affidavits to ease ‘ em — All were in motion , yet never a one , Let it move as it might , could ever move on , “ These , ” said the Spirit , “ you plainly see , “ Are what they call suits in Chancery ! ” I heard a loud screaming of old and young , Like a chorus by fifty Vellutis sung ; Or an Irish Dump ( “ the words by Moore “ ) At an amateur concert screamed in score ;— So harsh on my ear that wailing fell Of the wretches who in this Limbo dwell ! It seemed like the dismal symphony Of the shapes ’ Aeneas in hell did see ; Or those frogs whose legs a barbarous cook Cut off and left the frogs in the brook , To cry all night , till life 's last dregs , “ Give us our legs !— give us our legs ! ” Touched with the sad and sorrowful scene , I askt what all this yell might mean , When the Spirit replied , with a grin of glee , “ ‘ Tis the cry of the Suitors in Chancery ! ” I lookt and I saw a wizard rise ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>With a wig like a cloud before men 's eyes . In his aged hand he held a wand , Wherewith he beckoned his embryo band , And they moved and moved as he waved it o'er , But they never get on one inch the more . And still they kept limping to and fro , Like Ariels round old Prospero — Saying , “ Dear Master , let us go , ” But still old Prospero answered “ No . ” And I heard the while that wizard elf Muttering , muttering spells to himself , While o'er as many old papers he turned , As Hume e'er moved for or Omar burned . He talkt of his virtue — “ tho ’ some , less nice , ( He owned with a sigh ) preferred his Vice ” — And he said , “ I think ” — “ I doubt ” — “ I hope , ” Called God to witness , and damned the Pope ; With many more sleights of tongue and hand I could n't for the soul of me understand . Amazed and posed , I was just about To ask his name , when the screams without , The merciless clack of the imps within , And that conjuror 's mutterings , made such a din , That , startled , I woke — leapt up in my bed — Found the Spirit , the imps , and the conjuror fled , And blest my stars , right pleased to see , That I was n't as yet in Chancery .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Lord Chancellor Eldon .

Southey and Butler nigh coming to blows , To decide whether Dunstan , that strong-bodied Saint , Ever truly and really pulled the De'il ' s nose ; Whether t'other Saint , Dominic , burnt the De'il ' s paw — Whether Edwy intrigued with Elgiva 's odd mother — And many such points , from which Southey can draw Conclusions most apt for our hating each other .

BY SIR W. CURTIS . 1826 . ‘ Twas evening time , in the twilight sweet I sailed along , when — whom should I meet But a Turtle journeying o'er the sea , “ On the service of his Majesty . "[ 1 ] When spying him first thro ’ twilight dim , I did n't know what to make of him ; But said to myself , as slow he plied His fins and rolled from side to side Conceitedly o'er the watery path — “ ‘ Tis my Lord of Stowell taking a bath , “ And I hear him now , among the fishes , “ Quoting Vatel and Burgersdicius ! ” But , no — ‘ twas , indeed , a Turtle wide And plump as ever these eyes descried ; A turtle juicy as ever yet Glued up the lips of a Baronet ! And much did it grieve my soul to see That an animal of such dignity , Like an absentee abroad should roam , When he ought to stay and be ate at home . But now “ a change came o'er my dream , ” Like the magic lantern 's shifting slider ; I lookt and saw by the evening beam On the back of that Turtle sat a rider — A goodly man with an eye so merry , I knew ‘ twas our Foreign Secretary ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Who there at his ease did sit and smile , Like Waterton on his crocodile ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Cracking such jokes , at every motion , As made the Turtle squeak with glee And own they gave him a lively notion Of what his forced-meat balls would be . So , on the Sec . in his glory went . Over that briny element , Waving his hand as he took farewell With graceful air , and bidding me tell Inquiring friends that the Turtle and he Were gone on a foreign embassy — To soften the heart of a Diplomat , Who is known to dote upon verdant fat , And to let admiring Europe see , That calipash and calipee Are the English forms of Diplomacy .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>We are told that the passport of this grand diplomatic Turtle ( sent by the Secretary for Foreign Affairs to a certain noble envoy ) described him as “ on his majesty 's service . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Mr. Canning .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Wanderings in South America . “ It was the first and last time [ says Mr. Waterton ] I was ever on a crocodile 's back . ” THE DONKEY AND HIS PANNIERS .

His owners and drivers stood round in amaze What ! Neddy , the patient , the prosperous Neddy , So easy to drive thro ’ the dirtiest ways For every description of job-work so ready ! One driver ( whom Ned might have “ hailed ” as a “ brother ” )[ 1 ] Had just been proclaiming his Donkey 's renown For vigor , for spirit , for one thing or other — When , lo ! mid his praises the Donkey came down !

Or — material fitter yet — If thou couldst a remnant get Of that stuff with which , of old , Sage Penelope , we 're told , Still by doing and undoing , Kept her suitors always wooing — That 's the stuff which I pronounce , is Fittest for Dame Eldon 's flounces .

Dublin , March 12 , 1827 .— Friday , after the arrival of the packet bringing the account of the defeat of the Catholic Question , in the House of Commons , orders were sent to the Pigeon-House to forward 5 , 000 , 000 rounds of musket-ball cartridge to the different garrisons round the country .— Freeman 's Journal . I have found out a gift for my Erin , A gift that will surely content her :— Sweet pledge of a love so endearing ! Five millions of bullets I 've sent her . She askt me for Freedom and Right , But ill she her wants understood ;— Ball cartridges , morning and night , Is a dose that will do her more good . There is hardly a day of our lives But we read , in some amiable trials , How husbands make love to their wives Thro ’ the medium of hemp and of vials . One thinks , with his mistress or mate A good halter is sure to agree — That love-knot which , early and late , I have tried , my dear Erin , on thee . While another , whom Hymen has blest With a wife that is not over placid , Consigns the dear charmer to rest , With a dose of the best Prussic acid . Thus , Erin ! my love do I show — Thus quiet thee , mate of my bed ! And , as poison and hemp are too slow , Do thy business with bullets instead . Should thy faith in my medicine be shaken , Ask Roden , that mildest of saints ; He 'll tell thee , lead , inwardly taken , Alone can remove thy complaints ;— That , blest as thou art in thy lot , Nothing 's wanted to make it more pleasant But being hanged , tortured and shot , Much oftener than thou art at present . Even Wellington 's self hath averred Thou art yet but half sabred and hung , And I loved him the more when I heard Such tenderness fall from his tongue . So take the five millions of pills , Dear partner , I herewith inclose ; ‘ Tis the cure that all quacks for thy ill , From Cromwell to Eldon , propose . And you , ye brave bullets that go , How I wish that , before you set out , The Devil of the Freischütz could know The good work you are going about . For he 'd charm ye , in spite of your lead . Into such supernatural wit . That you 'd all of you know , as you sped , Where a bullet of sense ought to hit .

TOUT POUR LA TRIPE . “ If in China or among the natives of India , we claimed civil advantages which were connected with religious usages , little as we might value those forms in our hearts , we should think common decency required us to abstain from treating them with offensive contumely ; and , though unable to consider them sacred , we would not sneer at the name of Fot , or laugh at the imputed divinity of Visthnou . ” — Courier , Tuesday .

Come take my advice , never trouble your cranium , When “ civil advantages ” are to be gained , What god or what goddess may help to obtain you ‘ em , Hindoo or Chinese , so they 're only obtained . In this world ( let me hint in your organ auricular ) All the good things to good hypocrites fall ; And he who in swallowing creeds is particular , Soon will have nothing to swallow at all . Oh place me where Fo ( or , as some call him , Fot ) Is the god from whom “ civil advantages ” flow , And you 'll find , if there 's anything snug to be got , I shall soon be on excellent terms with old Fo . Or were I where Vishnu , that four-handed god , Is the quadruple giver of pensions and places , I own I should feel it unchristian and odd Not to find myself also in Vishnu 's good graces .

THE “ LIVING DOG ” AND “ THE DEAD LION . ” 1828 . Next week will be published ( as “ Lives ” are the rage ) The whole Reminiscences , wondrous and strange , Of a small puppy-dog that lived once in the cage Of the late noble Lion at Exeter ‘ Change . Tho ’ the dog is a dog of the kind they call “ sad , ” ‘ Tis a puppy that much to good breeding pretends ; And few dogs have such opportunities had Of knowing how Lions behave — among friends ; How that animal eats , how he snores , how he drinks , Is all noted down by this Boswell so small ; And ‘ tis plain from each sentence , the puppy-dog thinks That the Lion was no such great things after all . Tho ’ he roared pretty well — this the puppy allows — It was all , he says , borrowed — all second-hand roar ; And he vastly prefers his own little bow-wows To the loftiest war-note the Lion could pour . ‘ Tis indeed as good fun as a Cynic could ask , To see how this cockney-bred setter of rabbits Takes gravely the Lord of the Forest to task , And judges of lions by puppy-dog habits . Nay , fed as he was ( and this makes it a dark case ) With sops every day from the Lion 's own pan , He lifts up his leg at the noble beast 's carcass . And does all a dog so diminutive can . However , the book 's a good book , being rich in Examples and warnings to lions high-bred , How they suffer small mongrelly curs in their kitchen , Who 'll feed on them living and foul them when dead .

THOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND . 1828 . Oft have I seen , in gay , equestrian pride , Some well-rouged youth round Astley 's Circus ride Two stately steeds — standing , with graceful straddle , Like him of Rhodes , with foot on either saddle , While to soft tunes — some jigs and some andantes — He steers around his light-paced Rosinantes . So rides along , with canter smooth and pleasant , That horseman bold , Lord Anglesea , at present ;— Papist and Protestant the coursers twain , That lend their necks to his impartial rein , And round the ring — each honored , as they go , With equal pressure from his gracious toe — To the old medley tune , half “ Patrick 's Day ” And half “ Boyne Water , ” take their cantering way , While Peel , the showman in the middle , cracks His long-lasht whip to cheer the doubtful hacks . Ah , ticklish trial of equestrian art ! How blest , if neither steed would bolt or start ;— If Protestant 's old restive tricks were gone , And Papist 's winkers could be still kept on ! But no , false hopes — not even the great Ducrow ‘ Twixt two such steeds could ‘ scape an overthrow : If solar hacks played Phaëton a trick , What hope , alas , from hackneys lunatic ? If once my Lord his graceful balance loses , Or fails to keep each foot where each horse chooses ; If Peel but gives one extra touch of whip To Papist 's tail or Protestant 's ear-tip — That instant ends their glorious horsmanship ! Off bolt the severed steeds , for mischief free . And down between them plumps Lord Anglesea ! THE LIMBO OF LOST REPUTATIONS . A DREAM . “ Cio che si perde qui , là si raguna . ” ARIOSTO . “ — - a valley , where he sees Things that on earth were lost . ” MILTON . 1828 . Knowest thou not him<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>the poet sings , Who flew to the moon 's serene domain , And saw that valley where all the things , That vanish on earth are found again — The hopes of youth , the resolves of age , The vow of the lover , the dream of the sage , The golden visions of mining cits , The promises great men strew about them ; And , packt in compass small , the wits Of monarchs who rule as well without them !— Like him , but diving with wing profound , I have been to a Limbo underground , Where characters lost on earth , ( and cried , In vain , like Harris 's , far and wide ,) In heaps like yesterday 's orts , are thrown And there , so worthless and flyblown That even the imps would not purloin them , Lie till their worthy owners join them . Curious it was to see this mass Of lost and torn-up reputations ;— Some of them female wares , alas ! Mislaid at innocent assignations ; Some , that had sighed their last amen From the canting lips of saints that would be ; And some once owned by “ the best of men , ” Who had proved-no better than they should be . ‘ Mong others , a poet 's fame I spied , Once shining fair , now soakt and black — “ No wonder ” ( an imp at my elbow cried ) , “ For I pickt it out of a butt of sack ! ” Just then a yell was heard o'er head , Like a chimney-sweeper 's lofty summons ; And lo ! a devil right downward sped , Bringing within his claws so red Two statesmen 's characters , found , he said , Last night , on the floor of the House of Commons ; The which , with black official grin , He now to the Chief Imp handed in ;— Both these articles much the worse For their journey down , as you may suppose ; But one so devilish rank — “ Odd 's curse ! ” . Said the Lord Chief Imp , and held his nose . “ Ho , ho ! ” quoth he , “ I know full well “ From whom these two stray matters fell ; ” — Then , casting away , with loathful shrug , The uncleaner waif ( as he would a drug The Invisible 's own dark hand had mixt ) , His gaze on the other<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>firm he fixt , And trying , tho ’ mischief laught in his eye , To be moral because of the young imps by , “ What a pity ! ” he cried — “ so fresh its gloss , “ So long preserved — ‘ tis a public loss ! “ This comes of a man , the careless blockhead , “ Keeping his character in his pocket ; “ And there — without considering whether “ There 's room for that and his gains together — “ Cramming and cramming and cramming away , “ Till — out slips character some fine day ! “ However ” — and here he viewed it round — “ This article still may pass for sound . “ Some flaws , soon patched , some stains are all “ The harm it has had in its luckless fall . “ Here , Puck ! ” and he called to one of his train — “ The owner may have this back again . “ Tho ’ damaged for ever , if used with skill , “ It may serve perhaps to trade on still ; “ Tho ’ the gem can never as once be set , “ It will do for a Tory Cabinet . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Astolpho .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Huskisson . HOW TO WRITE BY PROXY . qui facit per alium facit per se . ‘ Mong our neighbors , the French , in the good olden time When Nobility flourisht , great Barons and Dukes Often set up for authors in prose and in rhyme , But ne'er took the trouble to write their own books . Poor devils were found to do this for their betters ;— And one day a Bishop , addressing a Blue , Said , “ Ma'am , have you read my new Pastoral Letters ? ” To which the Blue answered — “ No , Bishop , have you ? ” The same is now done by our privileged class ; And to show you how simple the process it needs , If a great Major-General<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>wishes to pass For an author of History , thus he proceeds :— First , scribbling his own stock of notions as well As he can , with a goose-quill that claims him as kin , He settles his neckcloth — takes snuff — rings the bell , And yawningly orders a Subaltern in . The Subaltern comes — sees his General seated , In all the self-glory of authorship swelling ;— “ There look , ” saith his Lordship , “ my work is completed ,— “ It wants nothing now but the grammar and spelling . ” Well used to a breach , the brave Subaltern dreads Awkward breaches of syntax a hundred times more ; And tho ’ often condemned to see breaking of heads , He had ne'er seen such breaking of Priscian 's before . However , the job 's sure to pay — that 's enough — So , to it he sets with his tinkering hammer , Convinced that there never was job half so tough As the mending a great Major-General 's grammar . But lo ! a fresh puzzlement starts up to view — New toil for the Sub .— for the Lord new expense : ‘ Tis discovered that mending his grammar wo n't do , As the Subaltern also must find him in sense ! At last — even this is achieved by his aid ; Friend Subaltern pockets the cash and — the story ; Drums beat — the new Grand March of Intellect 's played — And off struts my Lord , the Historian , in glory !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Or Lieutenant-General , as it may happen to be .

Alas ! my Lord , ‘ twas not well done , ‘ Twas not , indeed ,— tho ’ sad at heart , From office and its sweets to part , Yet hopes of coming in again , Sweet Tory hopes ! beguiled our pain ; But thus to miss that tail of thine , Thro ’ long , long years our rallying sign — As if the State and all its powers By tenancy in tail were ours — To see it thus by scissors fall , This was “ the unkindest cut of all ! ” It seemed as tho ’ the ascendant day Of Toryism had past away , And proving Samson 's story true , She lost her vigor with her queue .

    <p>TO THE REVEREND ——. ONE OF THE SIXTEEN REQUISITIONISTS OF NOTTINGHAM . 1828 . What , you , too , my ******, in hashes so knowing , Of sauces and soups Aristarchus profest ! Are you , too , my savory Brunswicker , going To make an old fool of yourself with the rest ? Far better to stick to your kitchen receipts ; And — if you want something to tease — for variety , Go study how Ude , in his “ Cookery , ” treats Live eels when he fits them for polisht society . Just snuggling them in , ‘ twixt the bars of the fire , He leaves them to wriggle and writhe on the coals ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In a manner that Horner himself would admire , And wish , ‘ stead of eels , they were Catholic souls . Ude tells us the fish little suffering feels ; While Papists of late have more sensitive grown ; So take my advice , try your hand at live eels , And for once let the other poor devils alone . I have even a still better receipt for your cook — How to make a goose die of confirmed hepatitis ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>And if you 'll , for once , fellow-feelings o'erlook , A well-tortured goose a most capital sight is . First , catch him , alive — make a good steady fire — Set your victim before it , both legs being tied , ( As if left to himself he might wish to retire ,) And place a large bowl of rich cream by his side . There roasting by inches , dry , fevered , and faint , Having drunk all the cream you so civilly laid , off , He dies of as charming a liver complaint As ever sleek person could wish a pie made of . Besides , only think , my dear one of Sixteen , What an emblem this bird , for the epicure 's use meant . Presents of the mode in which Ireland has been Made a tid-bit for yours and your brethren 's amusement : Tied down to the stake , while her limbs , as they quiver , A slow fire of tyranny wastes by degrees — No wonder disease should have swelled up her liver , No wonder you , Gourmands , should love her disease .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The only way , Monsieur Ude assures us , to get rid of the oil so objectionable in this fish .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>A liver complaint . The process by which the livers of geese are enlarged for the famous Pates de foie d'oie . IRISH ANTIQUITIES . According to some learned opinions The Irish once were Carthaginians ; But trusting to more late descriptions I 'd rather say they were Egyptians . My reason 's this :— the Priests of Isis , When forth they marched in long array , Employed , ‘ mong other grave devices , A Sacred Ass to lead the way ; And still the antiquarian traces ‘ Mong Irish Lords this Pagan plan , For still in all religious cases They put Lord Roden in the van . A CURIOUS FACT . The present Lord Kenyon ( the Peer who writes letters , For which the waste-paper folks much are his debtors ) Hath one little oddity well worth reciting , Which puzzleth observers even more than his writing . Whenever Lord Kenyon doth chance to behold A cold Apple-pie — mind , the pie must be cold — His Lordship looks solemn ( few people know why ) , And he makes a low bow to the said apple-pie . This idolatrous act in so “ vital ” a Peer , Is by most serious Protestants thought rather queer — Pie-worship , they hold , coming under the head ( Vide Crustium , chap , iv . ) of the Worship of Bread . Some think ‘ tis a tribute , as author he owes For the service that pie-crust hath done to his prose ;— The only good things in his pages , they swear , Being those that the pastry-cook sometimes put there . Others say , ‘ tis a homage , thro ’ piecrust conveyed , To our Glorious Deliverer 's much-honored shade ; As that Protestant Hero ( or Saint , if you please ) Was as fond of cold pie as he was of green pease ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>And ‘ tis solely in loyal remembrance of that , My Lord Kenyon to apple-pie takes off his hat . While others account for this kind salutation ; ” — By what Tony Lumpkin calls “ concatenation ; ” A certain good-will that , from sympathy 's ties , ‘ Twixt old Apple-women and Orange-men lies . But ‘ tis needless to add , these are all vague surmises , For thus , we 're assured , the whole matter arises : Lord Kenyon 's respected old father ( like many Respected old fathers ) was fond of a penny ; And loved so to save ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>that — there 's not the least question — His death was brought on by a bad indigestion , From cold apple-pie-crust his Lordship would stuff in At breakfast to save the expense of hot muffin . Hence it is , and hence only , that cold apple-pies Are beheld by his Heir with such reverent eyes — Just as honest King Stephen his beaver might doff To the fishes that carried his kind uncle off — And while filial piety urges so many on , ‘ Tis pure apple-pie-ety moves my Lord Kenyon .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>See the anecdote , which the Duchess of Marlborough relates in her Memoirs , of this polite hero appropriating to himself one day , at dinner , a whole dish of green peas — the first of the season — while the poor Princess Anne , who was then in a longing condition , sat by vainly entreating with her eyes for a share .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The same prudent propensity characterizes his descendant , who ( as is well known ) would not even go to the expense of a diphthong on his father 's monument , but had the inscription spelled , economically , thus :— “ mors janua vita ” NEW-FASHIONED ECHOES . Sir ,— Most of your readers are no doubt acquainted with the anecdote told of a certain not over-wise judge who , when in the act of delivering a charge in some country court-house , was interrupted by the braying of an ass at the door . “ What noise is that ? ” asked the angry judge . “ Only an extraordinary echo there is in court , my Lord , ” answered one of the counsel . As there are a number of such “ extraordinary echoes ” abroad just now , you will not , perhaps , be unwilling , Mr. Editor , to receive the following few lines suggested by them . Yours , etc . S. 1828 huc coeamus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>ait ; nullique libentius unquam responsura sono , coeamus , retulit echo . OVID . There are echoes , we know , of all sorts , From the echo that “ dies in the dale , ” To the “ airy-tongued babbler ” that sports Up the tide of the torrent her “ tale . ” There are echoes that bore us , like Blues , With the latest smart mot they have heard ; There are echoes extremely like shrews Letting nobody have the last word . In the bogs of old Paddy-land , too . Certain “ talented ” echoes<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>there dwell , Who on being askt , “ How do you do ? ” Politely reply ,  Pretty well , ” But why should I talk any more Of such old-fashioned echoes as these , When Britain has new ones in store , That transcend them by many degrees ? For of all repercussions of sound Concerning which bards make a pother , There 's none like that happy rebound When one blockhead echoes an other ;— When Kenyon commences the bray , And the Borough-Duke follows his track ; And loudly from Dublin 's sweet bay Rathdowne brays , with interest , back !— And while , of most echoes the sound On our ear by reflection doth fall , These Brunswickers<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>pass the bray round , Without any reflection at all . Oh Scott , were I gifted like you , Who can name all the echoes there are From Benvoirlich to bold Benvenue , From Benledi to wild Uamvar ; I might track thro ’ each hard Irish name The rebounds of this asinine strain , Till from Neddy to Neddy , it came To the chief Neddy , Kenyon , again ; Might tell how it roared in Rathdowne , How from Dawson it died off genteelly — How hollow it hung from the crown Of the fat-pated Marquis of Ely ; How on hearing my Lord of Glandine , Thistle-eaters the stoutest gave way , Outdone in their own special line By the forty-ass power of his bray ! But , no — for so humble a bard ‘ Tis a subject too trying to touch on ; Such noblemen 's names are too hard , And their noddles too soft to dwell much on . Oh Echo , sweet nymph of the hill , Of the dell and the deep-sounding shelves ; If in spite of Narcissus you still Take to fools who are charmed with themselves , Who knows but , some morning retiring , To walk by the Trent 's wooded side , You may meet with Newcastle , admiring His own lengthened ears in the tide ! Or , on into Cambria straying , Find Kenyon , that double tongued elf , In his love of ass-cendency , braying A Brunswick duet with himself !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ Let us from Clubs . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Commonly called “ Paddy Blake 's Echoes ” .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Anti-Catholic associations , under the title of Brunswick Clubs , were at this time becoming numerous both in England and Ireland .

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD POLITICIAN . Whene'er you 're in doubt , said a Sage I once knew , ‘ Twixt two lines of conduct which course to pursue , Ask a woman 's advice , and , whate'er she advise , Do the very reverse and you 're sure to be wise . Of the same use as guides the Brunswicker throng ; In their thoughts , words and deeds , so instinctively wrong , That whatever they counsel , act , talk or indite , Take the opposite course and you 're sure to be right . So golden this rule , that , had nature denied you The use of that finger-post , Reason , to guide you — Were you even more doltish than any given man is , More soft than Newcastle , more twaddling than Van is . I 'd stake my repute , on the following conditions , To make you the soundest of sound politicians . Place yourself near the skirts of some high-flying Tory — Some Brunswicker parson , of port-drinking glory ,— Watch well how he dines , during any great Question — What makes him feel gayly , what spoils his digestion — And always feel sure that his joy o'er a stew Portends a clear case of dyspepsia to you . Read him backwards , like Hebrew — whatever he wishes Or praises , note down as absurd or pernicious . Like the folks of a weather-house , shifting about , When he 's out be an In-when he 's in be an Out . Keep him always reversed in your thoughts , night and day , Like an Irish barometer turned the wrong way :— If he 's up you may swear that foul weather is nigh ; If he 's down you may look for a bit of blue sky . Never mind what debaters or journalists say , Only ask what he thinks and then think t'other way . Does he hate the Small-note Bill ? then firmly rely The Small-note Bill 's a blessing , tho ’ you do n't know why . Is Brougham his aversion ? then Harry 's your man . Does he quake at O'Connell ? take doubly to Dan . Is he all for the Turks ? then at once take the whole Russian Empire ( Tsar , Cossacks and all ) to your soul . In short , whatsoever he talks , thinks or is , Be your thoughts , words and essence the contrast of his . Nay , as Siamese ladies — at least the polite ones ,— All paint their teeth black , ‘ cause the devil has white ones - If even by the chances of time or of tide Your Tory for once should have sense on his side , Even then stand aloof — for be sure that Old Nick When a Tory talks sensibly , means you some trick . Such my recipe is — and , in one single verse , I shall now , in conclusion , its substance rehearse , Be all that a Brunswicker is not nor could be , And then — you  ll be all that an honest man should be . EPISTLE OF CONDOLENCE . FROM A SLAVE-LORD , TO A COTTON-LORD . Alas ! my dear friend , what a state of affairs ! How unjustly we both are despoiled of our rights ! Not a pound of black flesh shall I leave to my heirs , Nor must you any more work to death little whites . Both forced to submit to that general controller Of King , Lords and cotton mills , Public Opinion , No more shall you beat with a big billy-roller . Nor I with the cart-whip assert my dominion . Whereas , were we suffered to do as we please With our Blacks and our Whites , as of yore we were let , We might range them alternate , like harpsichord keys , And between us thump out a good piebald duet . But this fun is all over ;— farewell to the zest Which Slavery now lends to each teacup we sip ; Which makes still the cruellest coffee the best , And that sugar the sweetest which smacks of the whip . Farewell too the Factory 's white pickaninnies — Small , living machines which if flogged to their tasks Mix so well with their namesakes , the “ Billies ” and “ Jennies , ” That which have got souls in ‘ em nobody asks ;— Little Maids of the Mill , who themselves but ill-fed , Are obliged , ‘ mong their other benevolent cares , To “ keep feeding the scribblers ,"[ 1 ] — and better , ‘ tis said , Than old Blackwood or Fraser have ever fed theirs . All this is now o'er and so dismal my loss is , So hard ‘ tis to part from the smack of the throng , That I mean ( from pure love for the old whipping process ) , To take to whipt syllabub all my life long .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>One of the operations in cotton mills usually performed by children . THE GHOST OF MILTIADES . ah quoties dubies Scriptis exarsit amator . OVID . The Ghost of Miltiades came at night , And he stood by the bed of the Benthamite , And he said , in a voice that thrilled the frame , “ If ever the sound of Marathon 's name Hath fired thy blood or flusht thy brow , “ Lover of Liberty , rouse thee now ! ” The Benthamite yawning left his bed — Away to the Stock Exchange he sped , And he found the Scrip of Greece so high , That it fired his blood , it flusht his eye , And oh ! ‘ twas a sight for the Ghost to see , For never was Greek more Greek than he ! And still as the premium higher went , His ecstasy rose — so much per cent . ( As we see in a glass that tells the weather The heat and the silver rise together ,) And Liberty sung from the patriot 's lip , While a voice from his pocket whispered “ Scrip ! ” The Ghost of Miltiades came again ;— He smiled , as the pale moon smiles thro ’ rain , For his soul was glad at that patriot strain ; ( And poor , dear ghost — how little he knew The jobs and the tricks of the Philhellene crew ! ) “ Blessings and thanks ! ” was all he said , Then melting away like a night-dream fled ! The Benthamite hears — amazed that ghosts Could be such fools — and away he posts , A patriot still ? Ah no , ah no — Goddess of Freedom , thy Scrip is low , And warm and fond as thy lovers are , Thou triest their passion , when under par , The Benthamite 's ardor fast decays , By turns he weeps and swears and prays . And wishes the devil had Crescent and Cross , Ere he had been forced to sell at a loss . They quote him the Stock of various nations , But , spite of his classic associations , Lord ! how he loathes the Greek quotations ! “ Who 'll buy my Scrip ? Who 'll buy my Scrip ? ” Is now the theme of the patriot 's lip , As he runs to tell how hard his lot is To Messrs. Orlando and Luriottis , And says , “ Oh Greece , for Liberty 's sake , “ Do buy my Scrip , and I vow to break “ Those dark , unholy bonds of thine — “ If you 'll only consent to buy up mine ! ” The Ghost of Miltiades came once more ;— His brow like the night was lowering o'er , And he said , with a look that flasht dismay , “ Of Liberty 's foes the worst are they , “ Who turn to a trade her cause divine , “ And gamble for gold on Freedom 's shrine ! ” Thus saying , the Ghost , as he took his flight , Gave a Parthian kick to the Benthamite , Which sent him , whimpering , off to Jerry — And vanisht away to the Stygian ferry ! ALARMING INTELLIGENCE ! REVOLUTION IN THE DICTIONARY — ONE GALT AT THE HEAD OF IT . God preserve us !— there 's nothing now safe from assault ;— Thrones toppling around , churches brought to the hammer ; And accounts have just reached us that one Mr. Galt Has declared open war against English and Grammar ! He had long been suspected of some such design , And , the better his wicked intents to arrive at , Had lately ‘ mong Colburn 's troops of the line ( The penny-a-line men ) enlisted as private . There schooled , with a rabble of words at command , Scotch , English and slang in promiscuous alliance . He at length against Syntax has taken his stand , And sets all the Nine Parts of Speech at defiance . Next advices , no doubt , further facts will afford : In the mean time the danger most imminent grows , He has taken the Life of one eminent Lord , And whom he 'll next murder the Lord only knows .

RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT A LATE MEETING OF REVERENDS AND RIGHT REVERENDS . Resolved — to stick to every particle Of every Creed and every Article ; Reforming naught , or great or little , We 'll stanchly stand by every tittle , And scorn the swallow of that soul Which cannot boldly bolt the whole .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Resolved that tho ’ St. Athanasius In damning souls is rather spacious — Tho ’ wide and far his curses fall , Our Church “ hath stomach for them all ; ” And those who 're not content with such , May e'en be damned ten times as much .

Resolved that Hooper ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Latimer ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>And Cranmer ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>all extremely err , In taking such a low-bred view Of what Lords Spiritual ought to do :— All owing to the fact , poor men , That Mother Church was modest then , Nor knew what golden eggs her goose , The Public , would in time produce .

Those good men made the world their debtor , But we , the Church reformed , know better ; And taking all that all can pay , Balance the account the other way . Resolved our thanks profoundly due are To last month 's Quarterly Reviewer , Who proves by arguments so clear ( One sees how much he holds per year ) That England 's Church , tho ’ out of date , Must still be left to lie in state , As dead , as rotten and as grand as The mummy of King Osymandyas , All pickled snug — the brains drawn out — With costly cerements swathed about ,— And “ Touch me not , ” those words terrific , Scrawled o'er her in good hieroglyphic .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>One of the questions propounded to the Puritans in 1573 was — “ Whether the Book of Service was good and godly , every tittle grounded on the Holy Scripture ? ” On which an honest Dissenter remarks — “ Surely they had a wonderful opinion of their Service Book that there was not a tittle amiss , in it . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>“ They , ” the Bishops , “ know that the primitive Church had no such Bishops .

SIR ANDREW 'S DREAM . “ nec tu sperne piis venientia somnia portis : cum pia venerunt somnia , pondus liubent . ” PROPERT . lib . iv . eleg . 7 . As snug , on a Sunday eve , of late , In his easy chair Sir Andrew sate , Being much too pious , as every one knows , To do aught , of a Sunday eve , but doze , He dreamt a dream , dear , holy man , And I 'll tell you his dream as well as I can . He found himself , to his great amaze , In Charles the First 's high Tory days , And just at the time that gravest of Courts Had publisht its Book of Sunday Sports .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Sunday Sports ! what a thing for the ear Of Andrew even in sleep to hear !— It chanced to be too a Sabbath day When the people from church were coming away ; And Andrew with horror heard this song . As the smiling sinners flockt along ;— “ Long life to the Bishops , hurrah ! hurrah ! “ For a week of work and a Sunday of play “ Make the poor man 's life run merry away . ” “ The Bishops ! ” quoth Andrew , “ Popish , I guess , ” And he grinned with conscious holiness . But the song went on , and , to brim the cup Of poor Andy 's grief , the fiddles struck up ! “ Come , take out the lasses — let 's have a dance — “ For the Bishops allow us to skip our fill , “ Well knowing that no one 's the more in advance “ On the road to heaven , for standing still . “ Oh ! it never was meant that grim grimaces “ Should sour the cream of a creed of love ; “ Or that fellows with long , disastrous faces , “ Alone should sit among cherubs above . “ Then hurrah for the Bishops , etc . “ For Sunday fun we never can fail , “ When the Church herself each sport points out ;— “ There 's May-games , archery , Whitsun-ale , “ And a May-pole high to dance about . “ Or should we be for a pole hard driven , “ Some lengthy saint of aspect fell , “ With his pockets on earth and his nose in heaven , “ Will do for a May-pole just as well . “ Then hurrah for the Bishops , hurrah ! hurrah ! “ A week of work and a Sabbath of play “ Make the poor man 's life run merry away . ” To Andy , who does n't much deal in history , This Sunday scene was a downright mystery ; And God knows where might have ended the joke , But , in trying to stop the fiddles , he woke , And the odd thing is ( as the rumor goes ) That since that dream — which , one would suppose , Should have made his godly stomach rise . Even more than ever ‘ gainst Sunday pies — He has viewed things quite with different eyes ; Is beginning to take , on matters divine , Like Charles and his Bishops , the sporting line — Is all for Christians jigging in pairs , As an interlude ‘ twixt Sunday prayers :— Nay , talks of getting Archbishop Howley To bring in a Bill enacting duly That all good Protestants from this date May freely and lawfully recreate , Of a Sunday eve , their spirits moody , With Jack in the Straw or Punch and Judy .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Book of Sports drawn up by Bishop Moreton was first put forth in the reign of James I ., 1618 , and afterwards republished , at the advice of Laud , by Charles I ., 1633 , with an injunction that it should be “ made public by order from the Bishops . ” We find it therein declared , that “ for his good people 's recreation , his Majesty 's pleasure was , that after the end of divine service they should not be disturbed , letted , or discouraged from any lawful recreations , such as dancing , either of men or women , archery for men , leaping , vaulting , or any such harmless recreations , nor having of May-games , Whitsun-ales , or Morris-dances , or setting up of May poles , or other sports therewith used . ” etc .

So on from street to street I strode : And you can n't conceive how vastly odd The butchers lookt — a roseate crew , Inshrined in stalls with naught to do ; While some on a bench , half dozing , sat , And the Sacred Cows were not more fat . Still posed to think what all this scene Of sinecure trade was meant to mean , “ And , pray , ” askt I — “ by whom is paid The expense of this strange masquerade ? ” — “ The expense !— oh ! that 's of course defrayed ( Said one of these well-fed Hecatombers ) “ By yonder rascally rice-consumers . ” “ What ! they who must n't eat meat ! ” — No matter — ( And while he spoke his cheeks grew fatter ,) “ The rogues may munch their Paddy crop , “ But the rogues must still support our shop , “ And depend upon it , the way to treat “ Heretical stomachs that thus dissent , “ Is to burden all that wo n't eat meat , “ With a costly MEAT ESTABLISHMENT . ” On hearing these words so gravely said , With a volley of laughter loud I shook , And my slumber fled and my dream was sped , And I found I was lying snug in bed , With my nose in the Bishop of FERNS 'S book .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>An indefatigable scribbler of anti-Catholic pamphlets . THE BRUNSWICK CLUB . A letter having been addressed to a very distinguished personage , requesting him to become the Patron of this Orange Club , a polite answer was forthwith returned , of which we have been fortunate enough to obtain a copy . Brimstone-hall , September 1 , 1828 . Private ,— Lord Belzebub presents To the Brunswick Club his compliments . And much regrets to say that he Can not at present their Patron be . In stating this , Lord Belzebub Assures on his honor the Brunswick Club , That ‘ tis n't from any lukewarm lack Of zeal or fire he thus holds back — As even Lord Coal himself is not<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>For the Orange party more red-hot : But the truth is , still their Club affords A somewhat decenter show of Lords , And on its list of members gets A few less rubbishy Baronets , Lord Belzebub must beg to be Excused from keeping such company . Who the devil , he humbly begs to know , Are Lord Glandine , and Lord Dunlo ? Or who , with a grain of sense , would go To sit and be bored by Lord Mayo ? What living creature — except his nurse — For Lord Mountcashel cares a curse , Or think ‘ twould matter if Lord Muskerry Were ‘ tother side of the Stygian ferry ? Breathes there a man in Dublin town , Who 'd give but half of half-a-crown To save from drowning my Lord Rathdowne , Or who would n't also gladly hustle in Lords Roden , Bandon , Cole and Jocelyn ? In short , tho ’ from his tenderest years , Accustomed to all sorts of Peers , Lord Belzebub much questions whether He ever yet saw mixt together As ‘ twere in one capacious tub . Such a mess of noble silly-bub As the twenty Peers of the Brunswick Club . ‘ Tis therefore impossible that Lord B . Could stoop to such society , Thinking , he owns ( tho ’ no great prig ) , For one in his station ‘ twere infra dig . But he begs to propose , in the interim ( Till they find some properer Peers for him ) , His Highness of Cumberland , as Sub To take his place at the Brunswick Club — Begging , meanwhile , himself to dub Their obedient servant , BELZEBUB . It luckily happens , the Royal Duke Resembles so much , in air and look , The head of the Belzebub family , That few can any difference see ; Which makes him of course the better suit To serve as Lord B .

If Ude 's receipts have done things ill , To Weippert 's band they may go better ; There 's Lady **, in one quadrille , Would settle Europe , if you 'd let her : And who the deuce or asks or cares When Whigs or Tories have undone ‘ em , Whether they 've danced thro ’ State affairs , Or simply , dully , dined upon ‘ em ?

TO THE EDITOR OF THE * * *. Sir , Having heard some rumors respecting the strange and awful visitation under which Lord Henley has for some time past been suffering , in consequence of his declared hostility to “ anthems , solos , duets ,"[ 1 ] etc ., I took the liberty of making inquiries at his Lordship 's house this morning and lose no time in transmitting to you such particulars as I could collect . It is said that the screams of his Lordship , under the operation of this nightly concert , ( which is no doubt some trick of the Radicals ) , may be heard all over the neighborhood . The female who personates St. Cecilia is supposed to be the same that last year appeared in the character of Isis at the Rotunda . How the cherubs are managed , I have not yet ascertained . Yours , etc . P. P.<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In a work , on Church Reform , published by his Lordship in 1832 . LORD HENLEY AND ST. CECILIA — in Metii decenaat Judicis aures . HORAT . As snug in his bed Lord Henley lay , Revolving much his own renown , And hoping to add thereto a ray By putting duets and anthems down , Sudden a strain of choral sounds Mellifluous o'er his senses stole ; Whereat the Reformer muttered “ Zounds ! ” For he loathed sweet music with all his soul . Then starting up he saw a sight That well might shock so learned a snorer — Saint Cecilia robed in light With a portable organ slung before her . And round were Cherubs on rainbow wings , Who , his Lordship feared , might tire of flitting , So begged they 'd sit — but ah ! poor things , They 'd , none of them , got the means of sitting . “ Having heard , ” said the Saint , “ you 're fond of hymns , “ And indeed that musical snore betrayed you , “ Myself and my choir of cherubims “ Are come for a while to serenade you . ” In vain did the horrified Henley say “ ‘ Twas all a mistake — she was misdirected ; ” And point to a concert over the way Where fiddlers and angels were expected . In vain — the Saint could see in his looks ( She civilly said ) much tuneful lore ; So at once all opened their music-books , And herself and her Cherubs set off at score . All night duets , terzets , quartets , Nay , long quintets most dire to hear ; Ay , and old motets and canzonets And glees in sets kept boring his ear . He tried to sleep — but it would n't do ; So loud they squalled , he must attend to ‘ em . Tho ’ Cherubs ’ songs to his cost he knew Were like themselves and had no end to ‘ em . Oh judgment dire on judges bold , Who meddle with music 's sacred strains ! Judge Midas tried the same of old And was punisht like Henley for his pains . But worse on the modern judge , alas ! Is the sentence launched from Apollo 's throne ; For Midas was given the ears of an ass , While Henley is doomed to keep his own ! ADVERTISEMENT .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>1830 .

And still , poor Peer , to old and young , He goes on raving in that tongue ; Tells you how much you would enjoy a Trip to Dalnodubrovrkoya ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Talks of such places by the score on As Oulisflirmchinagoboron ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>And swears ( for he at nothing sticks ) That Russia swarms with Raskolniks , Tho ’ one such Nick , God knows , must be A more than ample quantity .

THE DANCE OF BISHOPS ; OR , THE EPISCOPAL QUADRILLE .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>A DREAM . 1833 . “ Solemn dances were , on great festivals and celebrations , admitted among the primitive Christians , in which even the Bishops and dignified Clergy were performers . Scaliger says , that the first Bishops were called praesules<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>for other reason than that they led off these dances . ” — “ Cyclopaedia , ” art . Dances . I 've had such a dream — a frightful dream — Tho ’ funny mayhap to wags ‘ twill seem , By all who regard the Church , like us , ‘ Twill be thought exceedingly ominous ! As reading in bed I lay last night — Which ( being insured ) is my delight — I happened to doze off just as I got to The singular fact which forms my motto . Only think , thought I , as I dozed away , Of a party of Churchmen dancing the hay ! Clerks , curates and rectors capering all With a neat-legged Bishop to open the ball ! Scarce had my eyelids time to close , When the scene I had fancied before me rose — An Episcopal Hop on a scale so grand As my dazzled eyes could hardly stand . For Britain and Erin clubbed their Sees To make it a Dance of Dignities , And I saw — oh brightest of Church events ! A quadrille of the two Establishments , Bishop to Bishop vis-à-vis , Footing away prodigiously . There was Bristol capering up to Derry , And Cork with London making merry ; While huge Llandaff , with a See , so so , Was to dear old Dublin pointing his toe . There was Chester , hatched by woman 's smile , Performing a chaine des Dames in style ; While he who , whene'er the Lords ’ House dozes , Can waken them up by citing Moses ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The portly Tuam , was all in a hurry To set , en avant , to Canterbury . Meantime , while pamphlets stuft his pockets , ( All out of date like spent skyrockets ,) Our Exeter stood forth to caper , As high on the floor as he doth on paper — like a dapper Dancing Dervise , Who pirouettes his whole church-service — Performing , midst those reverend souls , Such entrechats , such cabrioles , Such balonnés , such — rigmaroles , Now high , now low , now this , that , That none could guess what the devil he 'd be at ; Tho ’ , watching his various steps , some thought That a step in the Church was all he sought . But alas , alas ! while thus so gay . These reverend dancers friskt away , Nor Paul himself ( not the saint , but he Of the Opera-house ) could brisker be , There gathered a gloom around their glee — A shadow which came and went so fast , That ere one could say “ ‘ Tis there , ” ‘ twas past — And , lo ! when the scene again was cleared , Ten of the dancers had disappeared ! Ten able-bodied quadrillers swept From the hallowed floor where late they stept , While twelve was all that footed it still , On the Irish side of that grand Quadrille ! Nor this the worst :— still danced they on , But the pomp was saddened , the smile was gone ; And again from time to time the same Ill-omened darkness round them came — While still as the light broke out anew , Their ranks lookt less by a dozen or two ; Till ah ! at last there were only found Just Bishops enough for a four-hands-round ; And when I awoke , impatient getting , I left the last holy pair poussetting !

DICK * * * * A CHARACTER . Of various scraps and fragments built , Borrowed alike from fools and wits , Dick 's mind was like a patchwork quilt , Made up of new , old , motley bits — Where , if the Co. called in their shares , If petticoats their quota got And gowns were all refunded theirs , The quilt would look but shy , God wot . And thus he still , new plagiaries seeking , Reversed ventriloquism 's trick , For , ‘ stead of Dick thro ’ others speaking , ‘ Twas others we heard speak thro ’ Dick . A Tory now , all bounds exceeding , Now best of Whigs , now worst of rats ; One day with Malthus , foe to breeding , The next with Sadler , all for brats . Poor Dick !— and how else could it be ? With notions all at random caught , A sort of mental fricassee , Made up of legs and wings of thought — The leavings of the last Debate , or A dinner , yesterday , of wits , Where Dick sate by and , like a waiter , Had the scraps for perquisites . A CORRECTED REPORT OF SOME LATE SPEECHES . 1834 . “ Then I heard one saint speaking , and another saint said unto that saint , ” St. Sinclair rose and declared in smooth , That he would n't give sixpence to Maynooth . He had hated priests the whole of his life , For a priest was a man who had no wife ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>And , having no wife , the Church was his mother , The Church was his father , sister and brother . This being the case , he was sorry to say That a gulf ‘ twixt Papist and Protestant lay ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>So deep and wide , scarce possible was it To say even “ how d ’ ye do ? ” across it : And tho ’ your Liberals , nimble as fleas , Could clear such gulfs with perfect ease , ‘ Twas a jump that naught on earth could make Your proper , heavy-built Christian take . No , no ,— if a Dance of Sects must be , He would set to the Baptist willingly ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>At the Independent deign to smirk , And rigadoon with old Mother Kirk ; Nay even , for once , if needs must be , He 'd take hands round with all the three ; But as to a jig with Popery , no ,— To the Harlot ne'er would he point his toe . St. Mandeville was the next that rose ,— A saint who round as pedler goes With his pack of piety and prose , Heavy and hot enough , God knows ,— And he said that Papists were much inclined To extirpate all of Protestant kind , Which he could n't in truth so much condemn , Having rather a wish to extirpate them ; That is ,— to guard against mistake ,— To extirpate them for their doctrine 's sake ; A distinction Churchman always make ,— Insomuch that when they 've prime control , Tho ’ sometimes roasting heretics whole , They but cook the body for sake of the soul . Next jumpt St. Johnston jollily forth , The spiritual Dogberry of the North ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>A right “ wise fellow , and what 's more , An officer , ” like his type of yore ; And he asked if we grant such toleration , Pray , what 's the use of our Reformation ? What is the use of our Church and State ? Our Bishops , Articles , Tithe and Rate ? And still as he yelled out “ what 's the use ? ” Old Echoes , from their cells recluse Where they 'd for centuries slept , broke loose , Yelling responsive , “ What 's the use ? ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ He objected to the maintenance and education of clergy bound by the particular vows of celibacy , which as it were gave them the Church as their only family , making it fill the places of father and mother and brother . ” — Debate on the Grant to Maynooth College , The Times , April 19 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>“ It had always appeared to him that between the Catholic and Protestant a great gulf intervened , with rendered it impossible , ” etc .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The Baptist might acceptably extend the offices of religion to the Presbyterian and the Independent , or the member of the Church of England to any of the other three ; but the Catholic , ” etc .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>“ Could he then , holding as he did a spiritual office in the Church of Scotland , ( cries of hear , and laughter ,) with any consistency give his consent to a grant of money ? ” etc . MORAL POSITIONS . A DREAM . “ His Lordship said that it took a long time for a moral position to find its way across the Atlantic . He was very sorry that its voyage had been so long , ” etc .— Speech of Lord Dudley and Ward on Colonial Slavery , March 8 . T'other night , after hearing Lord Dudley 's oration ( A treat that comes once a year as May-day does ) , I dreamt that I saw — what a strange operation ! A “ moral position ” shipt off for Barbadoes . The whole Bench of Bishops stood by in grave attitudes , Packing the article tidy and neat ;— As their Reverences know that in southerly latitudes “ Moral positions ” do n't keep very sweet . There was Bathurst arranging the custom-house pass ; And to guard the frail package from tousing and routing , There stood my Lord Eldon , endorsing it “ Glass , ” Tho ’ as to which side should lie uppermost , doubting . The freight was however stowed safe in the hold ; The winds were polite and the moon lookt romantic , While off in the good ship “ The Truth ” we were rolled , With our ethical cargo , across the Atlantic . Long , dolefully long , seemed the voyage we made ; For “ The Truth , ” at all times but a very slow sailer , By friends , near as much as by foes , is delayed , And few come aboard her tho ’ so many hail her . At length , safe arrived , I went thro ’ “ tare and tret , ” Delivered my goods in the primest condition . And next morning read in the Bridge-town Gazette , “ Just arrived by ‘ The Truth , ’ a new moral position . “ The Captain ” — here , startled to find myself named As “ the Captain ” — ( a thing which , I own it with pain , I thro ’ life have avoided ,) I woke — lookt ashamed , Found I was n't a captain and dozed off again . THE MAD TORY AND THE COMET .

And still , as odd shapes seemed to flit thro ’ his glass , “ Ha ! there it is now , ” the poor maniac cries ; While his fancy with forms but too monstrous , alas ! From his own Tory zodiac peoples the skies :— “ Now I spy a big body , good heavens , how big ! “ Whether Bucky<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>or Taurus I cannot well say :— “ And yonder there 's Eldon 's old Chancery wig , “ In its dusty aphelion fast fading away . “ I see , ‘ mong those fatuous meteors behind , “ Londonderry , in vacuo , flaring about ;— “ While that dim double star , of the nebulous kind , “ Is the Gemini , Roden and Lorton , no doubt . “ Ah , Ellenborough ! ‘ faith , I first thought ‘ twas the Comet ; “ So like that in Milton , it made me quite pale ; “ The head with the same ‘ horrid hair ’ coming from it , “ And plenty of vapor , but — where is the tail ? ” Just then , up aloft jumpt the gazer elated — For lo ! his bright glass a phenomenon showed , Which he took to be Cumberland , upwards translated , Instead of his natural course , t'other road ! But too awful that sight for a spirit so shaken ,— Down dropt the poor Tory in fits and grimaces , Then off to the Bedlam in Charles Street was taken , And is now one of Halford 's most favorite cases .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Eclipses and comets have been always looked to as great changers of administrations .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The Duke of Buckingham .

You bid me explain , my dear angry Ma'amselle , How I came thus to bolt without saying farewell ; And the truth is ,— as truth you will have , my sweet railer ,— There are two worthy persons I always feel loath To take leave of at starting ,— my mistress and tailor ,— As somehow one always has scenes with them both ; The Snip in ill-humor , the Syren in tears , She calling on Heaven , and he on the attorney ,— Till sometimes , in short , ‘ twixt his duns and his dears , A young gentleman risks being stopt in his journey . But to come to the point , tho ’ you think , I dare say . That ‘ tis debt or the Cholera drives me away , ‘ Pon honor you 're wrong ;— such a mere bagatelle As a pestilence , nobody now-a-days fears ; And the fact is , my love , I 'm thus bolting , pell-mell , To get out of the way of these horrid new Peers ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This deluge of coronets frightful to think of ; Which England is now for her sins on the brink of ; This coinage of nobles ,— coined all of ‘ em , badly , And sure to bring Counts to a dis-count most sadly .

The prospect 's quite frightful , and what Sir George Rose ( My particular friend ) says is perfectly true , That , so dire the alternative , nobody knows , ‘ Twixt the Peers and the Pestilence , what he 's to do ; And Sir George even doubts ,— could he choose his disorder ,— ‘ Twixt coffin and coronet , which he would order . This being the case , why , I thought , my dear Emma , ‘ Twere best to fight shy of so curst a dilemma ; And tho ’ I confess myself somewhat a villain , To 've left idol mio without an addio , Console your sweet heart , and a week hence from Milan I 'll send you — some news of Bellini 's last trio .

Small presents for ladies ,— and nothing so wheedles The creatures abroad as your golden-eyed needles . A neat pocket Horace by which folks are cozened To think one knows Latin , when — one , perhaps , does n't ; With some little book about heathen mythology , Just large enough to refresh one 's theology ; Nothing on earth being half such a bore as Not knowing the difference ‘ twixt Virgins and Floras .

Ay , yoke ye to the bigots ’ car , Ye chosen of Alma Mater 's scions ; -  Fleet chargers drew the God of War , Great Cybele was drawn by lions , And Sylvan Pan , as Poet 's dream , Drove four young panthers in his team .

TRANSLATION FROM THE GULL LANGUAGE . Scripta manet . 1833 . ‘ Twas graved on the Stone of Destiny ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In letters four and letters three ; And ne'er did the King of the Gulls go by But those awful letters scared his eye ; For he knew that a Prophet Voice had said , “ As long as those words by man were read , “ The ancient race of the Gulls should ne'er “ One hour of peace or plenty share . ” But years on years successive flew , And the letters still more legible grew ,— At top , a T , an H , an E , And underneath , D. E. B. T. Some thought them Hebrew ,— such as Jews More skilled in Scrip than Scripture use ; While some surmised ‘ twas an ancient way Of keeping accounts , ( well known in the day Of the famed Didlerius Jeremias , Who had thereto a wonderful bias ,) And proved in books most learnedly boring , ‘ Twas called the Pontick way of scoring . Howe'er this be there never were yet Seven letters of the alphabet , That ‘ twixt them formed so grim a spell , Or scared a Land of Gulls so well , As did this awful riddle-me-ree Of T. H. E. D. E. B. T . Hark !— it is struggling Freedom 's cry ; “ Help , help , ye nations , or I die ; “ ‘ Tis Freedom 's fight and on the field “ Where I expire your doom is sealed . ” The Gull-King hears the awakening call , He hath summoned his Peers and Patriots all , And he asks . “ Ye noble Gulls , shall we “ Stand basely by at the fall of the Free , “ Nor utter a curse nor deal a blow ? ” And they answer with voice of thunder , “ No . ” Out fly their flashing swords in the air !— But ,— why do they rest suspended there ? What sudden blight , what baleful charm , Hath chilled each eye and checkt each arm ? Alas ! some withering hand hath thrown The veil from off that fatal stone , And pointing now with sapless finger , Showeth where dark those letters linger ,— Letters four and letters three , T. H. E. D. E. B. T. At sight thereof , each lifted brand Powerless falls from every hand ; In vain the Patriot knits his brow ,— Even talk , his staple , fails him now . In vain the King like a hero treads , His Lords of the Treasury shake their heads ; And to all his talk of “ brave and free , ” No answer getteth His Majesty But “ T. H. E. D. E. B.

NOTIONS ON REFORM . BY A MODERN REFORMER . Of all the misfortunes as yet brought to pass By this comet-like Bill , with its long tail of speeches , The saddest and worst is the schism which , alas ! It has caused between Wetherel 's waistcoat and breeches . Some symptoms of this Anti-Union propensity Had oft broken out in that quarter before ; But the breach , since the Bill , has attained such immensity , Daniel himself could have scarce wisht it more . Oh ! haste to repair it , ye friends of good order , Ye Atwoods and Wynns , ere the moment is past ; Who can doubt that we tread upon Anarchy 's border , When the ties that should hold men are loosening so fast ? Make Wetherel yield to “ some sort of Reform ” ( As we all must , God help us ! with very wry faces ;) And loud as he likes let him bluster and storm About Corporate Rights , so he 'll only wear braces . Should those he now sports have been long in possession , And , like his own borough , the worse for the wear , Advise him at least as a prudent concession To Intellect 's progress , to buy a new pair . Oh ! who that e'er saw him when vocal he stands , With a look something midway ‘ twixt Filch 's and Lockit 's , While still , to inspire him , his deeply-thrust hands Keep jingling the rhino in both breeches-pockets — Who that ever has listened thro ’ groan and thro ’ cough , To the speeches inspired by this music of pence ,— But must grieve that there 's any thing like falling off In that great nether source of his wit and his sense ? Who that knows how he lookt when , with grace debonair , He began first to court — rather late in the season — Or when , less fastidious , he sat in the chair Of his old friend , the Nottingham Goddess of Reason ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>That Goddess whose borough-like virtue attracted All mongers in both wares to proffer their love ; Whose chair like the stool of the Pythoness acted , As Wetherel 's rants ever since go to prove ; Who in short would not grieve if a man of his graces Should go on rejecting , unwarned by the past , The “ moderate Reform ” of a pair of new braces , Till , some day ,— he 'll all fall to pieces at last .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>It will be recollected that the learned gentleman himself boasted , one night , in the House of Commons , of having sat in the very chair which this allegorical lady had occupied . TORY PLEDGES . I pledge myself thro ’ thick and thin , To labor still with zeal devout To get the Outs , poor devils , in , And turn the Ins , the wretches , out . I pledge myself , tho ’ much bereft Of ways and means of ruling ill , To make the most of what are left , And stick to all that 's rotten still . Tho ’ gone the days of place and pelf , And drones no more take all the honey , I pledge myself to cram myself With all I can of public money . To quarter on that social purse My nephews , nieces , sisters , brothers , Nor , so we prosper , care a curse How much ‘ tis at the expense of others . I pledge myself , whenever Right And Might on any point divide , Not to ask which is black or white . But take at once the strongest side . For instance , in all Tithe discussions , I 'm for the Reverend encroachers : -  I loathe the Poles , applaud the Russians ,— Am for the Squires , against the Poachers . Betwixt the Corn-lords and the Poor I 've not the slightest hesitation ,— The People must be starved , to insure The Land its due remuneration . I pledge myself to be no more With Ireland 's wrongs beprosed or shammed ,— I vote her grievances a bore , So she may suffer and be damned . Or if she kick , let it console us , We still have plenty of red coats , To cram the Church , that general bolus , Down any given amount of throats . I dearly love the Frankfort Diet ,— Think newspapers the worst of crimes ; And would , to give some chance of quiet , Hang all the writers of “ The Times ; ” Break all their correspondents ’ bones , All authors of “ Reply , ” “ Rejoinder , ” From the Anti-Tory , Colonel Jones , To the Anti-Suttee , Mr. Poynder . Such are the Pledges I propose ; And tho ’ I can n't now offer gold , There 's many a way of buying those Who 've but the taste for being sold . So here 's , with three times three hurrahs , A toast of which you 'll not complain ,— “ Long life to jobbing ; may the days “ Of Peculation shine again ! ” ST. JEROME ON EARTH . FIRST VISIT . 1832 . As St. Jerome who died some ages ago , Was sitting one day in the shades below , “ I 've heard much of English bishops , ” quoth he , “ And shall now take a trip to earth to see “ How far they agree in their lives and ways “ With our good old bishops of ancient days . ” He had learned — but learned without misgivings — Their love for good living and eke good livings ; Not knowing ( as ne'er having taken degrees ) That good living means claret and fricassees , While its plural means simply — pluralities . “ From all I hear , ” said the innocent man , “ They are quite on the good old primitive plan . “ For wealth and pomp they little can care , “ As they all say ‘ No ’ to the Episcopal chair ; “ And their vestal virtue it well denotes “ That they all , good men , wear petticoats . ” Thus saying , post-haste to earth he hurries , And knocks at the Archbishop of Canterbury 's . The door was oped by a lackey in lace , Saying , “ What 's your business with his Grace ? ” “ His Grace ! ” quoth Jerome — for posed was he , Not knowing what sort this Grace could be ; Whether Grace preventing , Grace particular , Grace of that breed called Quinquarticular —<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In short he rummaged his holy mind The exact description of Grace to find , Which thus could represented be By a footman in full livery . At last , out loud in a laugh he broke , ( For dearly the good saint loved his joke )[ 2 ] And said — surveying , as sly he spoke , The costly palace from roof to base — “ Well , it is n't , at least , a saving Grace ! ” “ Umph ! ” said the lackey , a man of few words , “ The Archbishop is gone to the House of Lords . ” “ To the House of the Lord , you mean , my son , “ For in my time at least there was but one ; Unless such many-fold priests as these “ Seek , even in their LORD , pluralities ! "[ 3 ] “ No time for gab , ” quoth the man in lace : Then slamming the door in St. Jerome 's face With a curse to the single knockers all Went to finish his port in the servants ’ hall , And propose a toast ( humanely meant To include even Curates in its extent ) “ To all as serves the Establishment . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>So called from the proceedings of the Synod of Dort .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Witness his well known pun on the name of his adversary Vigilantius , whom he calls facetiously Dormitantius .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The suspicion attached to some of the early Fathers of being Arians in their doctrine would appear to derive some confirmation , from this passage . ST. JEROME ON EARTH . SECOND VISIT . “ This much I dare say , that , since lording and loitering hath come up , preaching hath come down , contrary to the Apostles ’ times . For they preached and lorded not ; and now they lord and preach not .... Ever since the Prelates were made Lords and Nobles , the plough standeth ; there is no work done , people starve . ” — Latimer , “ Sermon of the Plough . ” “ Once more , ” said Jerome , “ I 'll run up and see How the Church goes on , ” — and off set he . Just then the packet-boat which trades Betwixt our planet and the shades Had arrived below with a freight so queer , “ My eyes ! ” said Jerome , “ what have we here ? ” — For he saw , when nearer he explored , They 'd a cargo of Bishops ’ wigs aboard . “ They are ghosts of wigs , ” said Charon , “ all , “ Once worn by nobs Episcopal .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ For folks on earth , who 've got a store “ Of cast off things they 'll want no more , “ Oft send them down , as gifts , you know , “ To a certain Gentleman here below . “ A sign of the times , I plainly see , ” Said the Saint to himself as , pondering , he Sailed off in the death-boat gallantly . Arrived on earth , quoth he , “ No more “ I 'll affect a body as before ; “ For I think I 'd best , in the company “ Of Spiritual Lords , a spirit be , “ And glide unseen from See to See . ” But oh ! to tell what scenes he saw ,— It was more than Rabelais 's pen could draw . For instance , he found Exeter , Soul , body , inkstand , all in a stir ,— For love of God ? for sake of King ? For good of people ?— no such thing ; But to get for himself , by some new trick , A shove to a better bishoprick .

( VIDE DESCRIPTION OF A LATE FÊTE . )[ 1 ] 1832 . What a pleasing contrivance ! how aptly devised ‘ Twixt tar and magnolias to puzzle one 's noses ! And how the tar-barrels must all be surprised To find themselves seated like “ Love among roses ! ” What a pity we can n't , by precautions like these , Clear the air of that other still viler infection ; That radical pest , that old whiggish disease , Of which cases , true-blue , are in every direction . Stead of barrels , let 's light up an Auto da Fe Of a few good combustible Lords of “ the Club ; ” They would fume in a trice , the Whig cholera away , And there 's Bucky would burn like a barrel of bub . How Roden would blaze ! and what rubbish throw out ! A volcano of nonsense in active display ; While Vane , as a butt , amidst laughter , would spout The hot nothings he 's full of , all night and all day . And then , for a finish , there 's Cumberland 's Duke ,— Good Lord , how his chin-tuft would crackle in air ! Unless ( as is shrewdly surmised from his look ) He 's already bespoke for combustion elsewhere .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Marquis of Hertford 's Fête .— From dread of cholera his Lordship had ordered tar-barrels to be burned in every direction .

He , too , says “ ‘ tis painful ” — “ quite makes his heart bleed ” — But “ Your eels are a vile , oleaginous breed . ” — He would fain use them gently , but Cookery says “ No , ” And — in short — eels were born to be treated just so .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>‘ Tis the same with these Irish ,— who 're odder fish still ,— Your tender Whig heart shrinks from using them ill ; I myself in my youth , ere I came to get wise , Used at some operations to blush to the eyes :— But , in fact , my dear brother ,— if I may make bold To style you , as Peachum did Lockit , of old ,— We , Doctors , must act with the firmness of Ude , And , indifferent like him ,— so the fish is but stewed ,— Must torture live Pats for the general good .

Sweet singer of Romaldkirk , thou who art reckoned , By critics Episcopal , David the Second ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>If thus , as a Curate , so lofty your flight , Only think , in a Rectory , how you would write ! Once fairly inspired by the “ Tithe-crowned Apollo , ” ( Who beats , I confess it , our lay Phoebus hollow , Having gotten , besides the old Nine 's inspiration , The Tenth of all eatable things in creation . ) There 's nothing in fact that a poet like you , So be-nined and be-tenthed , could n't easily do . Round the lips of the sweet-tongued Athenian<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>they say , While yet but a babe in his cradle he lay , Wild honey-bees swarmed as presage to tell Of the sweet-flowing words that thence afterwards fell . Just so round our Overton 's cradle , no doubt , Tenth ducklings and chicks were seen flitting about ; Goose embryos , waiting their doomed decimation , Came , shadowing forth his adult destination , And small , sucking tithe-pigs , in musical droves , Announced the Church poet whom Chester approves . O Horace ! when thou , in thy vision of yore , Didst dream that a snowy-white plumage came o'er Thy etherealized limbs , stealing downily on , Till , by Fancy 's strong spell , thou wert turned to a swan , Little thought'st thou such fate could a poet befall , Without any effort of fancy , at all ; Little thought'st thou the world would in Overton find A bird , ready-made , somewhat different in kind , But as perfect as Michaelmas ’ self could produce , By gods yclept anser , by mortals a goose .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ Your Lordship , ” says Mr. Overton , in the Dedication of his Poem to the Bishop of Chester , ” has kindly expressed your persuasion that my Muse will always be a ‘ Muse of sacred song and that it will be tuned as David 's was . ’ ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Sophocles . SCENE FROM A PLAY , ACTED AT OXFORD , CALLED “ MATRICULATION . "[ 1 ] [ Boy discovered at a table , with the Thirty-Nine Articles before him .— Enter the Rt . Rev . Doctor Phillpots . ] Doctor P .— There , my lad , lie the Articles — ( Boy begins to count them ) just thirty nine — No occasion to count — you 've now only to sign . At Cambridge where folks are less High-church than we , The whole Nine-and-Thirty are lumped into Three . Let 's run o'er the items ;— there ‘ a Justification , Predestination , and Supererogation — Not forgetting Salvation and Creed Athanasian , Till we reach , at last , Queen Bess 's Ratification . That is sufficient — now , sign — having read quite enough , You “ believe in the full and true meaning thereof ? ” ( Boy stares . ) Oh ! a mere form of words , to make things smooth and brief ,— A commodious and short make-believe of belief , Which our Church has drawn up in a form thus articular To keep out in general all who 're particular . But what 's the boy doing ? what ! reading all thro ’ , And my luncheon fast cooling !— this never will do . Boy ( poring over the Articles ) .— Here are points which — pray , Doctor , what 's “ Grace of Congruity ? ” Doctor P. ( sharply ) .— You 'll find out , young sir , when you 've more ingenuity . At present , by signing , you pledge yourself merely . Whate'er it may be , to believe it sincerely , Both in dining and signing we take the same plan ,— First , swallow all down , then digest — as we can . Boy ( still reading ) .— I 've to gulp , I see , St. Athanasius 's Creed , Which . I 'm told , is a very tough morsel indeed ; As he damns — Doctor P. ( aside ) .— Ay , and so would I , willingly , too , All confounded particular young boobies , like you . This comes of Reforming !— all 's o'er with our land , When people won  t stand what they can n't under-stand ; Nor perceive that our ever-revered Thirty-Nine Were made not for men to believe but to sign .

LATE TITHE CASE . “ sic vos non vobis . ” 1833 . “ The Vicar of Birmingham desires me to state that , in consequence of the passing of a recent Act of Parliament , he is compelled to adopt measures which may by some be considered harsh or precipitate ; but , in duty to what he owes to his successors , he feels bound to preserve the rights of the vicarage . ” — Letter from Mr. S. Powell , August 6 . No , not for yourselves , ye reverend men , Do you take one pig in every ten , But for Holy Church 's future heirs , Who 've an abstract right to that pig , as theirs ; The law supposing that such heirs male Are already seized of the pig , in tail . No , not for himself hath Birmingham 's priest His “ well-beloved ” of their pennies fleeced : But it is that , before his prescient eyes , All future Vicars of Birmingham rise , With their embryo daughters , nephews , nieces , And ‘ tis for them the poor he fleeces . He heareth their voices , ages hence Saying , “ Take the pig ” — “ oh take the pence ; ” The cries of little Vicarial dears , The unborn Birminghamites , reach his ears ; And , did he resist that soft appeal , He would not like a true-born Vicar feel . Thou , too , Lundy of Lackington ! A rector true , if e'er there was one , Who , for sake of the Lundies of coming ages , Gripest the tenths of laborer 's wages .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>‘ Tis true , in the pockets of thy small-clothes The claimed “ obvention "[ 2 ] of four-pence goes ; But its abstract spirit , unconfined , Spreads to all future Rector-kind , Warning them all to their rights to wake , And rather to face the block , the stake , Than give up their darling right to take .

FOOLS ’ PARADISE . DREAM THE FIRST . I have been , like Puck , I have been , in a trice , To a realm they call Fool 's Paradise , Lying N. N. E . of the Land of Sense , And seldom blest with a glimmer thence . But they wanted not in this happy place , Where a light of its own gilds every face ; Or if some wear a shadowy brow , ‘ Tis the wish to look wise ,— not knowing how . Self-glory glistens o'er all that 's there , The trees , the flowers have a jaunty air ; The well-bred wind in a whisper blows , The snow , if it snows , is couleur de rose , The falling founts in a titter fall , And the sun looks simpering down on all . Oh , ‘ tis n't in tongue or pen to trace The scenes I saw in that joyous place . There were Lords and Ladies sitting together , In converse sweet , “ What charming weather !— “ You 'll all rejoice to hear , I 'm sure , “ Lord Charles has got a good sinecure ; “ And the Premier says , my youngest brother “ ( Him in the Guards ) shall have another . “ Isn  t this very , very gallant !— “ As for my poor old virgin aunt , “ Who has lost her all , poor thing , at whist , “ We must quarter her on the Pension List . ” Thus smoothly time in that Eden rolled ; It seemed like an Age of real gold , Where all who liked might have a slice , So rich was that Fools ’ Paradise . But the sport at which most time they spent , Was a puppet-show , called Parliament Performed by wooden Ciceros , As large as life , who rose to prose , While , hid behind them , lords and squires , Who owned the puppets , pulled the wires ; And thought it the very best device Of that most prosperous Paradise , To make the vulgar pay thro ’ the nose For them and their wooden Ciceros . And many more such things I saw In this Eden of Church and State and Law ; Nor e'er were known such pleasant folk As those who had the best of the joke . There were Irish Rectors , such as resort To Cheltenham yearly , to drink — port , And bumper , “ Long may the Church endure , “ May her cure of souls be a sinecure , “ And a score of Parsons to every soul “ A moderate allowance on the whole . ” There were Heads of Colleges lying about , From which the sense had all run out , Even to the lowest classic lees , Till nothing was left but quantities ; Which made them heads most fit to be Stuck up on a University , Which yearly hatches , in its schools , Such flights of young Elysian fools . Thus all went on , so snug and nice , In this happiest possible Paradise . But plain it was to see , alas ! That a downfall soon must come to pass . For grief is a lot the good and wise Don  t quite so much monopolize , But that ( “ lapt in Elysium ” as they are ) Even blessed fools must have their share . And so it happened :— but what befell , In Dream the Second I mean to tell . THE RECTOR AND HIS CURATE ; OR , ONE POUND TWO . “ I trust we shall part as we met , in peace and charity . My last payment to you paid your salary up to the 1st of this month . Since that , I owe you for one month , which , being a long month , of thirty-one days , amounts , as near as I can calculate , to six pounds eight shillings . My steward returns you as a debtor to the amount of SEVEN POUNDS TEN SHILLINGS FOR COX-ACRE-GROUND , which leaves some trifling balance in my favor . ” — Letter of Dismissal from the Rev . Marcus Beresford to his Curate , the Rev . T. A. Lyons . The account is balanced — the bill drawn out ,— The debit and credit all right , no doubt — The Rector rolling in wealth and state , Owes to his Curate six pound eight ; The Curate , that least well-fed of men , Owes to his Rector seven pound ten , Which maketh the balance clearly due From Curate to Rector , one pound two . Ah balance , on earth unfair , uneven ! But sure to be all set right in heaven , Where bills like these will be checkt , some day , And the balance settled the other way : Where Lyons the curate 's hard-wrung sum Will back to his shade with interest come ; And Marcus , the rector , deep may rue This tot , in his favor , of one pound two . PADDY 'S METAMORPHOSIS . 1833 . About fifty years since , in the days of our daddies , That plan was commenced which the wise now applaud , Of shipping off Ireland 's most turbulent Paddies , As good raw material for settlers , abroad . Some West-India island , whose name I forget , Was the region then chosen for this scheme so romantic ; And such the success the first colony met , That a second , soon after , set sail o'er the Atlantic . Behold them now safe at the long-lookt-for shore , Sailing in between banks that the Shannon might greet , And thinking of friends whom , but two years before , They had sorrowed to lose , but would soon again meet . And , hark ! from the shore a glad welcome there came — “ Arrah , Paddy from Cork , is it you , my sweet boy ? ” While Pat stood astounded , to hear his own name Thus hailed by black devils , who capered for joy ! Can it possibly be ?— half amazement — half doubt , Pat listens again — rubs his eyes and looks steady ; Then heaves a deep sigh , and in horror yells out , “ Good Lord ! only think ,— black and curly already ! ” Deceived by that well-mimickt brogue in his ears , Pat read his own doom in these wool-headed figures , And thought , what a climate , in less than two years , To turn a whole cargo of Pats into niggers ! MORAL . ‘ Tis thus ,— but alas ! by a marvel more true Than is told in this rival of Ovid 's best stories ,— Your Whigs , when in office a short year or two , By a lusus naturae , all turn into Tories . And thus , when I hear them “ strong measures ” advise , Ere the seats that they sit on have time to get steady , I say , while I listen , with tears in my eyes , “ Good Lord ! only think ,— black and curly already ! ” COCKER , ON CHURCH REFORM . FOUNDED UPON SOME LATE CALCULATIONS . 1833 . Fine figures of speech let your orators follow , Old Cocker has figures that beat them all hollow . Tho ’ famed for his rules Aristotle may be , In but half of this Sage any merit I see , For , as honest Joe Hume says , the “ tottle ” for me ! For instance , while others discuss and debate , It is thus about Bishops I ratiocinate . In England , where , spite of the infidel 's laughter , ‘ Tis certain our souls are lookt very well after , Two Bishops can well ( if judiciously sundered ) Of parishes manage two thousand two hundred .— Said number of parishes , under said teachers , Containing three millions of Protestant creatures ,— So that each of said Bishops full ably controls One million and five hundred thousands of souls . And now comes old Cocker . In Ireland we 're told , Half a million includes the whole Protestant fold ; If , therefore , for three million souls , ‘ tis conceded Two proper-sized Bishops are all that is needed , ‘ Tis plain , for the Irish half million who want ‘ em , One-third of one Bishop is just the right quantum . And thus , by old Cocker 's sublime Rule of Three , The Irish Church question 's resolved to a T ; Keeping always that excellent maxim in view , That , in saving men 's souls , we must save money too . Nay , if — as St. Roden complains is the case — The half million of soul is decreasing apace , The demand , too , for bishop will also fall off , Till the tithe of one , taken in kind be enough . But , as fractions imply that we 'd have to dissect , And to cutting up Bishops I strongly object . We 've a small , fractious prelate whom well we could spare , Who has just the same decimal worth , to a hair , And , not to leave Ireland too much in the lurch . We 'll let her have Exeter , sole , as her Church . LES HOMMES AUTOMATES . 1834 . “ We are persuaded that this our artificial man will not only walk and speak and perform most of the outward functions of animal life , but ( being wound up once a week ) will perhaps reason as well as most of your country parsons . ” — “ Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus , ” chap . xii . It being an object now to meet With Parsons that don  t want to eat , Fit men to fill those Irish rectories , Which soon will have but scant refectories , It has been suggested ,— lest that Church Should all at once be left in the lurch For want of reverend men endued With this gift of never requiring food ,— To try , by way of experiment , whether There couldn  t be made of wood and leather ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>( Howe'er the notion may sound chimerical ,) Jointed figures , not lay ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>but clerical , Which , wound up carefully once a week , Might just like parsons look and speak , Nay even , if requisite , reason too , As well as most Irish parsons do . The experiment having succeeded quite , ( Whereat those Lords must much delight , Who 've shown , by stopping the Church 's food , They think it isn  t for her spiritual good To be served by parsons of flesh and blood ,) The Patentees of this new invention Beg leave respectfully to mention , They now are enabled to produce An ample supply for present use , Of these reverend pieces of machinery , Ready for vicarage , rectory , deanery , Or any such-like post of skill That wood and leather are fit to fill . N. B .— In places addicted to arson , We can  t recommend a wooden parson : But if the Church any such appoints , They 'd better at least have iron joints . In parts , not much by Protestants haunted , A figure to look at 's all that 's wanted — A block in black , to eat and sleep , Which ( now that the eating 's o'er ) comes cheap . P. S .— Should the Lords , by way of a treat , Permit the clergy again to eat , The Church will of course no longer need Imitation-parsons that never feed ; And these wood creatures of ours will sell For secular purposes just as well — Our Beresfords , turned to bludgeons stout , May , ‘ stead of beating their own about , Be knocking the brains of Papists out ; While our smooth O'Sullivans , by all means , Should transmigrate into turning machines .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The materials of which those Nuremberg Savans , mentioned by Scriblerus , constructed their artificial man .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The wooden models used by painters are , it is well known , called “ lay figures ” . HOW TO MAKE ONE 'S SELF A PEER . ACCORDING TO THE NEWEST RECEIPT AS DISCLOSED IN A LATE HERALDIC WORK ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>1834 . Choose some title that 's dormant — the Peerage hath many — Lord Baron of Shamdos sounds nobly as any . Next , catch a dead cousin of said defunct Peer , And marry him , off hand , in some given year , To the daughter of somebody ,— no matter who ,— Fig , the grocer himself , if you 're hard run , will do ; For , the Medici pills still in heraldry tell , And why should n't lollypops quarter as well ? Thus , having your couple , and one a lord 's cousin , Young materials for peers may be had by the dozen ; And ‘ tis hard if , inventing each small mother 's son of ‘ em , You can n't somehow manage to prove yourself one of ‘ em . Should registers , deeds and such matters refractory , Stand in the way of this lord-manufactory , I 've merely to hint , as a secret auricular , One grand rule of enterprise ,— do n't be particular . A man who once takes such a jump at nobility , Must not mince the matter , like folks of nihility , But clear thick and thin with true lordly agility . ‘ Tis true , to a would-be descendant from Kings , Parish-registers sometimes are troublesome things ; As oft , when the vision is near brought about , Some goblin , in shape of a grocer , grins out ; Or some barber , perhaps , with my Lord mingles bloods , And one 's patent of peerage is left in the suds . But there are ways — when folks are resolved to be lords — Of expurging even troublesome parish records . What think ye of scissors ? depend o n't no heir Of a Shamdos should go unsupplied with a pair , As whate'er else the learned in such lore may invent , Your scissors does wonders in proving descent . Yes , poets may sing of those terrible shears With which Atropos snips off both bumpkins and peers , But they 're naught to that weapon which shines in the hands Of some would-be Patricians , when proudly he stands O'er the careless churchwarden 's baptismal array , And sweeps at each cut generations away . By some babe of old times is his peerage resisted ? One snip ,— and the urchin hath never existed ! Does some marriage , in days near the Flood , interfere With his one sublime object of being a Peer ? Quick the shears at once nullify bridegroom and bride ,— No such people have ever lived , married or died ! Such the newest receipt for those high minded elves , Who 've a fancy for making great lords of themselves . Follow this , young aspirer who pant'st for a peerage , Take S — m for thy model and B — z for thy steerage , Do all and much worse than old Nicholas Flam does , And — who knows but you 'll be Lord Baron of Shamdos ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The claim to the barony of Chandos ( if I recollect right ) advanced by the late Sir Egerinton Brydges .

Galloping , dreary duke ; The Duke is the lad to frighten a lass , He 's an ogre to meet , and the devil to pass , With his charger prancing , Grim eye glancing , Chin , like a Mufti , Grizzled and tufty , Galloping , dreary Duke .

As ‘ tis now , my dear Tully , some weeks since I started By railroad for earth , having vowed ere we parted To drop you a line by the Dead-Letter post , Just to say how I thrive in my new line of ghost , And how deucedly odd this live world all appears , To a man who 's been dead now for three hundred years , I take up my pen , and with news of this earth Hope to waken by turns both your spleen and your mirth . In my way to these shores , taking Italy first , Lest the change from Elysium too sudden should burst , I forgot not to visit those haunts where of yore You took lessons from Paetus in cookery 's lore . Turned aside from the calls of the rostrum and Muse , To discuss the rich merits of rôtis and stews , And preferred to all honors of triumph or trophy , A supper on prawns with that rogue , little Sophy . Having dwelt on such classical musings awhile , I set off by a steam-boat for this happy isle , ( A conveyance you ne'er , I think , sailed by , my Tully , And therefore , per next , I 'll describe it more fully ,) Having heard on the way what distresses me greatly , That England 's o'errun by idolaters lately , Stark , staring adorers of wood and of stone , Who will let neither stick , stock or statue alone . Such the sad news I heard from a tall man in black , Who from sports continental was hurrying back , To look after his tithes ;— seeing , doubtless , ‘ twould follow , That just as of old your great idol , Apollo , Devoured all the Tenths , so the idols in question , These wood and stone gods , may have equal digestion , And the idolatrous crew whom this Rector despises , May eat up the tithe-pig which he idolizes . London . ‘ Tis all but too true — grim Idolatry reigns In full pomp over England 's lost cities and plains ! On arriving just now , as my first thought and care Was as usual to seek out some near House of Prayer , Some calm holy spot , fit for Christians to pray on , I was shown to — what think you ?— a downright Pantheon ! A grand , pillared temple with niches and halls , Full of idols and gods , which they nickname St. Paul 's ;— Tho ’ ‘ tis clearly the place where the idolatrous crew Whom the Rector complained of , their dark rites pursue ; And , ‘ mong all the “ strange gods ” Abr'ham ' s father carved out ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>That he ever carv 'd stranger than these I much doubt . Were it even , my dear TULLY , your Hebes and Graces , And such pretty things , that usurpt the Saints ’ places , I shouldn  t much mind ,— for in this classic dome Such folks from Olympus would feel quite at home . But the gods they 've got here !— such a queer omnium gatherum Of misbegot things that no poet would father ‘ em ;— Britannias in light summer-wear for the skies ,— Old Thames turned to stone , to his no small surprise ,— Father Nile , too ,— a portrait , ( in spite of what 's said , That no mortal e'er yet got a glimpse of his head ,) And a Ganges which India would think somewhat fat for't , Unless ‘ twas some full-grown Director had sat for't ;— Not to mention the et caeteras of Genii and Sphinxes , Fame , Victory , and other such semi-clad minxes ;— Sea Captains ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>— the idols here most idolized ; And of whom some , alas ! might too well be comprized Among ready-made Saints , as they died cannonized ; With a multitude more of odd cockneyfied deities , Shrined in such pomp that quite shocking to see it ‘ tis ; Nor know I what better the Rector could do Than to shrine there his own beloved quadruped too ; As most surely a tithe-pig , whate'er the world thinks , is A much fitter beast for a church than a Sphinx is . But I 'm called off to dinner — grace just has been said , And my host waits for nobody , living or dead .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Joshua xxiv 2 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Captains Mosse , Riou etc .

The one , the best lover we have — of his years , And the other Prime Statesman of Britain 's dominions . Go , Hero of Chancery , blest with the smile Of the Misses that love and the monarchs that prize thee ; Forget Mrs. Angelo Taylor awhile , And all tailors but him who so well dandifies thee . Never mind how thy juniors in gallantry scoff , Never heed how perverse affidavits may thwart thee , But show the young Misses thou'rt scholar enough To translate “ Amor Fortis ” a love , about forty ! And sure ‘ tis no wonder , when , fresh as young Mars , From the battle you came , with the Orders you 'd earned i n't , That sweet Lady Fanny should cry out “ My stars ! ” And forget that the Moon , too , was some way concerned i n't . For not the great Regent himself has endured ( Tho ’ I 've seen him with badges and orders all shine , Till he lookt like a house that was over insured ) A much heavier burden of glories than thine . And ‘ tis plain , when a wealthy young lady so mad is , Or any young ladies can so go astray , As to marry old Dandies that might be their daddies , The stars are in fault , my Lord Stewart , not they ! Thou , too , t'other brother , thou Tully of Tories , Thou Malaprop Cicero , over whose lips Such a smooth rigmarole about ; “ monarchs , ” and “ glories , ” And “ nullidge , ” and “ features , ” like syllabub slips . Go , haste , at the Congress pursue thy vocation Of adding fresh sums to this National Debt of ours , Leaguing with Kings , who for mere recreation Break promises , fast as your Lordship breaks metaphors . Fare ye well , fare ye well , bright Pair of Peers , And may Cupid and Fame fan you both with their pinions ! The one , the best lover we have — of his years , And the other , Prime Statesman of Britain 's dominions .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This and the following squib , which must have been written about the year 1815-16 , have been by some oversight misplaced .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Ovid is mistaken in saying that it was “ at Paris ” these rapacious transactions took place — we should read “ at Vienna . ”</p>

    <p>TO THE SHIP IN WHICH LORD CASTLEREAGH SAILED FOR THE CONTINENT . Imitated from Horace , lib . i , ode 3 . So may my Lady 's prayers prevail , And Canning 's too , and lucid Bragge 's , And Eldon beg a favoring gale From Eolus , that older Bags , To speed thee on thy destined way , Oh ship , that bearest our Castlereagh , Our gracious Regent 's better half And therefore quarter of a King — ( As Van or any other calf May find without much figuring ) . Waft him , oh ye kindly breezes , Waft this Lord of place and pelf , Any where his Lordship pleases , Tho ’ ‘ twere to Old Nick himself ! Oh , what a face of brass was his . Who first at Congress showed his phiz — To sign away the Rights of Man To Russian threats and Austrian juggle ; And leave the sinking African To fall without one saving struggle — ‘ Mong ministers from North and South , To show his lack of shame and sense , And hoist the sign of “ Bull and Mouth ” For blunders and for eloquence ! In vain we wish our Secs , at home To mind their papers , desks , and shelves , If silly Secs , abroad will roam And make such noodles of themselves . But such hath always been the case — For matchless impudence of face , There 's nothing like your Tory race ! First , Pitt , the chosen of England , taught her A taste for famine , fire and slaughter . Then came the Doctor , for our ease , With Eldons , Chathams , Hawksburies , And other deadly maladies . When each in turn had run their rigs , Necessity brought in the Whigs : And oh ! I blush , I blush to say , When these , in turn , were put to flight , too , Illustrious TEMPLE flew away With lots of pens he had no right to .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In short , what will not mortal man do ? And now , that — strife and bloodshed past — We 've done on earth what harm we can do , We gravely take to heaven at last And think its favoring smile to purchase ( Oh Lord , good Lord ! ) by — building churches !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This alludes to the 1200l . worth of stationery , which his Lordship is said to have ordered , when on the point of vacating his place . SKETCH OF THE FIRST ACT OF A NEW ROMANTIC DRAMA . “ And now , ” quoth the goddess , in accents jocose , “ Having got good materials , I 'll brew such a dose “ Of Double X mischief as , mortals shall say , “ They 've not known its equal for many a long day . ” Here she winkt to her subaltern imps to be steady , And all wagged their fire-tipt tails and stood ready . “ So , now for the ingredients :— first , hand me that bishop ; ” Whereupon , a whole bevy of imps run to fish up From out a large reservoir wherein they pen ‘ em The blackest of all its black dabblers in venom ; And wrapping him up ( lest the virus should ooze , And one “ drop of the immortal "[ 1 ] Right Rev .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>they might lose ) In the sheets of his own speeches , charges , reviews , Pop him into the caldron , while loudly a burst From the by-standers welcomes ingredient the first ! “ Now fetch the Ex-Chancellor , ” muttered the dame — “ He who 's called after Harry the Older , by name . ” “ The Ex-Chancellor ! ” echoed her imps , the whole crew of ‘ em — “ Why talk of one Ex , when your Mischief has two of ‘ em ? ” “ True , true , ” said the hag , looking arch at her elves , “ And a double-Ex dose they compose , in themselves . ” This joke , the sly meaning of which was seen lucidly , Set all the devils a laughing most deucedly . So , in went the pair , and ( what none thought surprising ) Showed talents for sinking as great as for rising ; While not a grim phiz in that realm but was lighted With joy to see spirits so twin-like united — Or ( plainly to speak ) two such birds of a feather , In one mess of venom thus spitted together . Here a flashy imp rose — some connection , no doubt , Of the young lord in question — and , scowling about , “ Hoped his fiery friend , Stanley , would not be left out ; “ As no schoolboy unwhipt , the whole world must agree , “ Loved mischief , pure mischief , more dearly than he . ” But , no — the wise hag wouldn  t hear of the whipster ; Not merely because , as a shrew , he eclipst her , And nature had given him , to keep him still young , Much tongue in his head and no head in his tongue ; But because she well knew that , for change ever ready , He 'd not even to mischief keep properly steady : That soon even the wrong side would cease to delight , And , for want of a change , he must swerve to the right ; While , on each , so at random his missiles he threw , That the side he attackt was most safe , of the two .— This ingredient was therefore put by on the shelf , There to bubble , a bitter , hot mess , by itself . “ And now , ” quoth the hag , as her caldron she eyed . And the tidbits so friendlily rankling inside , “ There wants but some seasoning ;— so , come , ere I stew ‘ em , “ By way of a relish we 'll throw in John Tuam . ’ “ In cooking up mischief , there 's no flesh or fish “ Like your meddling High Priest , to add zest to the dish . ” Thus saying , she pops in the Irish Grand Lama — Which great event ends the First Act of the Drama .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>To lose no drop of the immortal man .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The present Bishop of Exeter . ANIMAL MAGNETISM . Tho ’ famed was Mesmer , in his day , Nor less so , in ours , is Dupotet , To say nothing of all the wonders done By that wizard , Dr. Elliotson , When , standing as if the gods to invoke , he Up waves his arm , and — down drops Okey !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Tho ’ strange these things , to mind and sense , If you wish still stranger things to see — If you wish to know the power immense Of the true magnetic influence , Just go to her Majesty 's Treasury , And learn the wonders working there — And I 'll be hanged if you don  t stare ! Talk of your animal magnetists , And that wave of the hand no soul resists , Not all its witcheries can compete With the friendly beckon towards Downing Street , Which a Premier gives to one who wishes To taste of the Treasury loaves and fishes . It actually lifts the lucky elf , Thus acted upon , above himself ;— He jumps to a state of clairvoyance , And is placeman , statesman , all , at once ! These effects , observe ( with which I begin ) , Take place when the patient 's motioned in ; Far different of course the mode of affection , When the wave of the hand 's in the out direction ; The effects being then extremely unpleasant , As is seen in the case of Lord Brougham , at present ; In whom this sort of manipulation , Has lately produced such inflammation , Attended with constant irritation , That , in short — not to mince his situation — It has workt in the man a transformation That puzzles all human calculation ! Ever since the fatal day which saw That “ pass ” performed on this Lord of Law — A pass potential , none can doubt , As it sent Harry Brougham to the right about — The condition in which the patient has been Is a thing quite awful to be seen . Not that a casual eye could scan This wondrous change by outward survey ; It being , in fact , the interior man That 's turned completely topsy-turvy :— Like a case that lately , in reading o'er ‘ em , I found in the Acta Eruditorum , Of a man in whose inside , when disclosed , The whole order of things was found transposed ; By a lusus naturae , strange to see , The liver placed where the heart should be , And the spleen ( like Brougham 's , since laid on the shelf ) As diseased and as much out of place as himself . In short , ‘ tis a case for consultation , If e'er there was one , in this thinking nation ; And therefore I humbly beg to propose , That those savans who mean , as the rumor goes , To sit on Miss Okey 's wonderful case , Should also Lord Parry 's case embrace ; And inform us , in both these patients ’ states , Which ism it is that predominates , Whether magnetism and somnambulism , Or , simply and solely , mountebankism .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The name of the heroine of the performances at the North London Hospital . THE SONG OF THE BOX . Let History boast of her Romans and Spartans , And tell how they stood against tyranny 's shock ; They were all , I confess , in my eye , Betty Martins Compared to George Grote and his wonderful Box . Ask , where Liberty now has her seat ?— Oh , it is n't By Delaware 's banks or on Switzerland 's rocks ;— Like an imp in some conjuror 's bottle imprisoned , She 's slyly shut up in Grote 's wonderful Box . How snug !— ‘ stead of floating thro ’ ether 's dominions , Blown this way and that , by the “ populi vox , ” To fold thus in silence her sinecure pinions , And go fast asleep in Grote 's wonderful Box . Time was , when free speech was the life-breath of freedom — So thought once the Seldens , the Hampdens , the Lockes ; But mute be our troops , when to ambush we lead ‘ em , “ For Mum ” is the word with us Knights of the Box . Pure , exquisite Box ! no corruption can soil it ; There 's Otto of Rose in each breath it unlocks ; While Grote is the “ Betty , ” that serves at the toilet , And breathes all Arabia around from his Box . ‘ Tis a singular fact , that the famed Hugo Grotius ( A namesake of Grote 's — being both of Dutch stocks ) , Like Grote , too , a genius profound as precocious , Was also , like him , much renowned for a Box ;— An immortal old clothes-box , in which the great Grotius When suffering in prison for views heterodox , Was packt up incog . spite of jailers ferocious ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>And sent to his wife ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>carriage free , in a Box ! But the fame of old Hugo now rests on the shelf , Since a rival hath risen that all parallel mocks ;— That Grotius ingloriously saved but himself , While ours saves the whole British realm by a Box ! And oh ! when , at last , even this greatest of Grotes Must bend to the Power that at every door knocks , May he drop in the urn like his own “ silent votes , ” And the tomb of his rest be a large Ballot-Box . While long at his shrine , both from county and city , Shall pilgrims triennially gather in flocks , And sing , while they whimper , the appropriate ditty , “ Oh breathe not his name , let it sleep — in the Box . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>For the particulars of this escape of Grotius from the Castle of Louvenstein , by means of a box ( only three feet and a half long , it is said ) in which books used to be occasionally sent to him and foul linen returned , see any of the Biographical Dictionaries .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>This is not quite according to the facts of the case ; his wife having been the contriver of the stratagem , and remained in the prison herself to give him time for escape . ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW THALABA . ADDRESSED TO ROBERT SOUTHEY , ESQ . When erst , my Southey , thy tuneful tongue The terrible tale of Thalaba sung — Of him , the Destroyer , doomed to rout That grim divan of conjurors out , Whose dwelling dark , as legends say , Beneath the roots of the ocean lay , ( Fit place for deep ones , such as they ,) How little thou knewest , dear Dr. Southey , Altho ’ bright genius all allow thee , That , some years thence , thy wondering eyes Should see a second Thalaba rise — As ripe for ruinous rigs as thine , Tho ’ his havoc lie in a different line , And should find this new , improved Destroyer Beneath the wig of a Yankee lawyer ; A sort of an “ alien , ” alias man , Whose country or party guess who can , Being Cockney half , half Jonathan ; And his life , to make the thing completer , Being all in the genuine Thalaba metre , Loose and irregular as thy feet are ;— First , into Whig Pindarics rambling , Then in low Tory doggrel scrambling ; Now love his theme , now Church his glory ( At once both Tory and ama-tory ) , Now in the Old Bailey-lay meandering , Now in soft couplet style philandering ; And , lastly , in lame Alexandrine , Dragging his wounded length along , When scourged by Holland 's silken thong . In short , dear Bob , Destroyer the Second May fairly a match for the First be reckoned ; Save that your Thalaba 's talent lay In sweeping old conjurors clean away , While ours at aldermen deals his blows , ( Who no great conjurors are , God knows ,) Lays Corporations , by wholesale , level , Sends Acts of Parliament to the devil , Bullies the whole Milesian race — Seven millions of Paddies , face to face ; And , seizing that magic wand , himself , Which erst thy conjurors left on the shelf , Transforms the boys of the Boyne and Liffey All into foreigners , in a jiffy — Aliens , outcasts , every soul of ‘ em , Born but for whips and chains , the whole of ‘ em ? Never in short did parallel Betwixt two heroes gee so well ; And among the points in which they fit , There 's one , dear Bob , I can  t omit . That hacking , hectoring blade of thine Dealt much in the Domdaniel line ; And ‘ tis but rendering justice due , To say that ours and his Tory crew Damn Daniel most devoutly too . RIVAL TOPICS .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>AN EXTRAVAGANZA . Oh Wellington and Stephenson , Oh morn and evening papers , Times , Herald , Courier , Globe , and Sun , When will ye cease our ears to stun With these two heroes ’ capers ? Still “ Stephenson ” and “ Wellington , ” The everlasting two !— Still doomed , from rise to set of sun , To hear what mischief one has done , And t'other means to do :— What bills the banker past to friends , But never meant to pay ; What Bills the other wight intends , As honest , in their way ;— Bills , payable at distant sight , Beyond the Grecian kalends , When all good deeds will come to light , When Wellington will do what 's right , And Rowland pay his balance . To catch the banker all have sought , But still the rogue unhurt is ; While t'other juggler — who 'd have thought ? Tho ’ slippery long , has just been caught By old Archbishop Curtis ;— And , such the power of papal crook , The crosier scarce had quivered About his ears , when , lo ! the Duke Was of a Bull delivered ! Sir Richard Birnie doth decide That Rowland “ must be mad , ” In private coach , with crest , to ride , When chaises could be had . And t'other hero , all agree , St. Luke 's will soon arrive at , If thus he shows off publicly , When he might pass in private . Oh Wellington , oh Stephenson , Ye ever-boring pair , Where'er I sit , or stand , or run , Ye haunt me everywhere . Tho ’ Job had patience tough enough , Such duplicates would try it ; Till one 's turned out and t'other off , We Shan  have peace or quiet . But small 's the chance that Law affords — Such folks are daily let off ; And , ‘ twixt the old Bailey and the Lords , They both , I fear , will get off .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The date of this squib must have been , I think , about 1828-9 . THE BOY STATESMAN . BY A TORY . “ That boy will be the death of me . ” Matthews at Home . Ah , Tories dear , our ruin is near , With Stanley to help us , we can  t but fall ; Already a warning voice I hear , Like the late Charles Matthews ’ croak in my ear , “ That boy — that boy 'll be the death of you all . ” He will , God help us !— not even Scriblerius In the “ Art of Sinking ” his match could be ; And our case is growing exceeding serious , For , all being in the same boat as he , If down my Lord goes , down go we , Lord Baron Stanley and Company , As deep in Oblivion 's swamp below As such “ Masters Shallow , ” well could go ; And where we shall all both low and high , Embalmed in mud , as forgotten lie As already doth Graham of Netherby ! But that boy , that boy !— there 's a tale I know , Which in talking of him comes àpropos . Sir Thomas More had an only son , And a foolish lad was that only one , And Sir Thomas said one day to his wife , “ My dear , I can  t but wish you joy . “ For you prayed for a boy , and you now have a boy , “ Who 'll continue a boy to the end of his life . ” Even such is our own distressing lot , With the ever-young statesman we have got ; Nay even still worse ; for Master More Was n't more a youth than he 'd been before , While ours such power of boyhood shows , That the older he gets the more juvenile he grows , And at what extreme old age he 'll close His schoolboy course , heaven only knows ;— Some century hence , should he reach so far , And ourselves to witness it heaven condemn , We shall find him a sort of cub Old Parr , A whipper-snapper Methusalem ; Nay , even should he make still longer stay of it , The boy 'll want judgment , even to the day of it ! Meanwhile , ‘ tis a serious , sad infliction ; And day and night with awe I recall The late Mr. Matthews ’ solemn prediction , “ That boy 'll be the death , the death of you all . ” LETTER FROM LARRY O'BRANIGAN TO THE REV . MURTHAGH O'MULLIGAN . Arrah , where were you , Murthagh , that beautiful day ?— Or how came it your riverence was laid on the shelf , When that poor craythur , Bobby — as you were away — Had to make twice as big a Tomfool of himself . Troth , it wasn  t at all civil to lave in the lurch A boy so deserving your tindhr'est affection :— Too such iligant Siamase twins of the Church , As Bob and yourself , ne'er should cut the connection . If thus in two different directions you pull , ‘ Faith , they 'll swear that yourself and your riverend brother Are like those quare foxes , in Gregory 's Bull , Whose tails were joined one way , while they lookt another !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Och blest be he , whosomdever he be , That helpt soft Magee to that Bull of a Letther !

Finding it to be the wish , however , of my reverend friend — as I am now glad to be permitted to call him — that both the wrong and the reparation , the Ode and , the Palinode , should be thus placed in juxtaposition , I have thought it but due to him , to comply with his request . MUSINGS OF AN UNREFORMED PEER . Of all the odd plans of this monstrously queer age , The oddest is that of reforming the peerage ;— Just as if we , great dons , with a title and star , Did not get on exceedingly well as we are , And perform all the functions of noodles by birth As completely as any born noodles on earth . How acres descend , is in law-books displayed , But we as wiseacres descend , ready made ; And by right of our rank in Debrett 's nomenclature , Are all of us born legislators by nature ;— Like ducklings to water instinctively taking , So we with like quackery take to lawmaking ; And God forbid any reform should come o'er us , To make us more wise than our sires were before us . The Egyptians of old the same policy knew — If your sire was a cook , you must be a cook too : Thus making , from father to son , a good trade of it , Poisoners by right ( so no more could be said of it ) , The cooks like our lordships a pretty mess made of it ; While , famed for conservative stomachs , the Egyptians Without a wry face bolted all the prescriptions . It is true , we 've among us some peers of the past , Who keep pace with the present most awfully fast — Fruits that ripen beneath the new light now arising With speed that to us , old conserves , is surprising . Conserves , in whom — potted , for grandmamma uses — ‘ Twould puzzle a sunbeam to find any juices . ‘ Tis true too . I fear , midst the general movement , Even our House , God help it , is doomed to improvement , And all its live furniture , nobly descended But sadly worn out , must be sent to be mended . With movables ‘ mong us , like Brougham and like Durham , No wonder even fixtures should learn to bestir ‘ em ; And distant , ye gods , be that terrible day , When — as playful Old Nick , for his pastime , they say , Flies off with old houses , sometimes , in a storm — So ours may be whipt off , some night , by Reform ; And as up , like Loretto 's famed house ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>thro ’ the air , Not angels , but devils , our lordships shall bear , Grim , radical phizzes , unused to the sky , Shall flit round , like cherubs , to wish us “ good-by , ” While perched up on clouds little imps of plebeians , Small Grotes and O'Connells , shall sing Io Paeans .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Casa Santa , supposed to have been carried by angels through the air from Galilee to Italy . THE REVEREND PAMPHLETEER . A ROMANTIC BALLAD . Oh , have you heard what hapt of late ? If not , come lend an ear , While sad I state the piteous fate Of the Reverend Pamphleteer . All praised his skilful jockeyship , Loud rung the Tory cheer , While away , away , with spur and whip , Went the Reverend Pamphleteer . The nag he rode — how could it err ? ‘ Twas the same that took , last year , That wonderful jump to Exeter With the Reverend Pamphleteer . Set a beggar on horseback , wise men say , The course he will take is clear : And in that direction lay the way Of the Reverend Pamphleteer , “ Stop , stop , ” said Truth , but vain her cry — Left far away in the rear , She heard but the usual gay “ Good-by ” From her faithless Pamphleteer . You may talk of the jumps of Homer 's gods , When cantering o'er our sphere — I 'd back for a bounce , ‘ gainst any odds , This Reverend Pamphleteer . But ah ! what tumbles a jockey hath ! In the midst of his career , A file of the Times lay right in the path Of the headlong Pamphleteer . Whether he tript or shyed thereat , Doth not so clear appear : But down he came , as his sermons flat — This Reverend Pamphleteer ! Lord King himself could scarce desire To see a spiritual Peer Fall much more dead , in the dirt and mire , Than did this Pamphleteer . Yet pitying parsons many a day Shall visit his silent bier , And , thinking the while of Stanhope , say “ Poor dear old Pamphleteer ! “ He has finisht at last his busy span , “ And now lies coolly here — “ As often he did in life , good man , “ Good , Reverend Pamphleteer ! ” RECENT DIALOGUE . 1825 . A Bishop and a bold dragoon , Both heroes in their way , Did thus , of late , one afternoon , Unto each other say :— “ Dear bishop , ” quoth the brave huzzar , “ As nobody denies “ That you a wise logician are , “ And I am — otherwise , “ ‘ Tis fit that in this question , we “ Stick each to his own art — “ That yours should be the sophistry , “ And mine the fighting part . “ My creed , I need not tell you , is “ Like that of Wellington , “ To whom no harlot comes amiss , “ Save her of Babylon ; “ And when we 're at a loss for words , “ If laughing reasoners flout us , “ For lack of sense we 'll draw our swords — “ The sole thing sharp about us . ” — “ Dear bold dragoon , ” the bishop said , “ ‘ Tis true for war thou art meant ; “ And reasoning — bless that dandy head ! “ Is not in thy department . “ So leave the argument to me — “ And , when my holy labor “ Hath lit the fires of bigotry , “ Thou'lt poke them with thy sabre . “ From pulpit and from sentrybox , “ We 'll make our joint attacks , “ I at the head of my Cassocks , “ And you , of your Cossacks . “ So here 's your health , my brave huzzar , “ My exquisite old fighter — “ Success to bigotry and war , “ The musket and the mitre ! ” Thus prayed the minister of heaven — While York , just entering then , Snored out ( as if some Clerk had given His nose the cue ) “ Amen . ” THE WELLINGTON SPA . “ And drink oblivion to our woes . ” Anna Matilda . 1829 . Talk no more of your Cheltenham and Harrowgate springs , ‘ Tis from Lethe we now our potations must draw ; Yon Lethe 's a cure for — all possible things , And the doctors have named it the Wellington Spa . Other physical waters but cure you in part ; One cobbles your gout — t'other mends your digestion — Some settle your stomach , but this — bless your heart !— It will settle for ever your Catholic Question . Unlike too the potions in fashion at present , This Wellington nostrum , restoring by stealth , So purges the memory of all that 's unpleasant , That patients forget themselves into rude health . For instance , the inventor — his having once said “ He should think himself mad if at any one 's call , “ He became what he is ” — is so purged from his head That he now doesn  t think he 's a madman at all . Of course , for your memories of very long standing — Old chronic diseases that date back undaunted To Brian Boroo and Fitz-Stephens ’ first landing — A devil of a dose of the Lethe is wanted . But even Irish patients can hardly regret An oblivion so much in their own native style , So conveniently planned that , whate'er they forget , They may go on remembering it still all the while ! A CHARACTERLESS 1834 . Half Whig , half Tory , like those mid-way things , ‘ Twixt bird and beast , that by mistake have wings ; A mongrel Stateman , ‘ twixt two factions nurst , Who , of the faults of each , combines the worst — The Tory 's loftiness , the Whigling 's sneer , The leveller 's rashness , and the bigot 's fear : The thirst for meddling , restless still to show How Freedom 's clock , repaired by Whigs , will go ; The alarm when others , more sincere than they , Advance the hands to the true time of day . By Mother Church , high-fed and haughty dame , The boy was dandled , in his dawn of fame ; Listening , she smiled , and blest the flippant tongue On which the fate of unborn tithe-pigs hung . Ah ! who shall paint the grandam 's grim dismay , When loose Reform enticed her boy away ; When shockt she heard him ape the rabble 's tone , And in Old Sarum 's fate foredoom her own ! Groaning she cried , while tears rolled down her cheeks , “ Poor , glib-tongued youth , he means not what he speaks . “ Like oil at top , these Whig professions flow , “ But , pure as lymph , runs Toryism below . “ Alas ! that tongue should start thus , in the race , “ Ere mind can reach and regulate its pace !— “ For , once outstript by tongue , poor , lagging mind , “ At every step , still further limps behind . “ But , bless the boy !— whate'er his wandering be , “ Still turns his heart to Toryism and me . “ Like those odd shapes , portrayed in Dante 's lay . “ With heads fixt on , the wrong and backward way , “ His feet and eyes pursue a diverse track , “ While those march onward , these look fondly back . ” And well she knew him — well foresaw the day , Which now hath come , when snatched from Whigs away The self-same changeling drops the mask he wore , And rests , restored , in granny 's arms once more . But whither now , mixt brood of modern light And ancient darkness , canst thou bend thy flight ? Tried by both factions and to neither true , Feared by the old school , laught at by the new ; For this too feeble and for that too rash , This wanting more of fire , that less of flash , Lone shalt thou stand , in isolation cold , Betwixt two worlds , the new one and the old , A small and “ vext Bermoothes , ” which the eye Of venturous seaman sees — and passes by . A GHOST STORY . To THE AIR OF “ UNFORTUNATE MISS BAILEY . ” 1835 . Not long in bed had Lyndhurst lain , When , as his lamp burned dimly , The ghosts of corporate bodies slain ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Stood by his bedside grimly . Dead aldermen who once could feast , But now , themselves , are fed on , And skeletons of mayors deceased , This doleful chorus led on :— Oh Lord Lyndhurst , “ Unmerciful Lord Lyndhurst , “ Corpses we , “ All burkt by thee , “ Unmerciful Lord Lyndhurst ! ” “ Avaunt , ye frights ! ” his Lordship cried , “ Ye look most glum and whitely . ” “ Ah , Lyndhurst dear ! ” the frights replied , “ You 've used us unpolitely . “ And now , ungrateful man ! to drive “ Dead bodies from your door so , “ Who quite corrupt enough , alive , “ You 've made by death still more so . “ Oh , Ex-Chancellor , “ Destructive Ex-Chancellor , “ See thy work , “ Thou second Burke , “ Destructive Ex-Chancellor ! ” Bold Lyndhurst then , whom naught could keep Awake or surely that would , Cried “ Curse you all ” — fell fast asleep — And dreamt of “ Small v.

I sat me down in my easy chair , To read , as usual , the morning papers ; But — who shall describe my look of despair , When I came to Lefroy 's “ destructive ” capers ! That he — that , of all live men , Lefroy Should join in the cry “ Destroy , destroy ! ” Who , even when a babe , as I 've heard said , On Orange conserve was chiefly fed , And never , till now , a movement made That wasn  t manfully retrograde ! Only think — to sweep from the light of day Mayors , maces , criers and wigs away ; To annihilate — never to rise again — A whole generation of aldermen , Nor leave them even the accustomed tolls , To keep together their bodies and souls !— At a time too when snug posts and places Are falling away from us one by one , Crash — crash — like the mummy-cases Belzoni , in Egypt , sat upon , Wherein lay pickled , in state sublime , Conservatives of the ancient time ;— To choose such a moment to overset The few snug nuisances left us yet ; To add to the ruin that round us reigns , By knocking out mayors ’ and town-clerks ’ brains ; By dooming all corporate bodies to fall , Till they leave at last no bodies at all — Naught but the ghosts of by-gone glory , Wrecks of a world that once was Tory !— Where pensive criers , like owls unblest , Robbed of their roosts , shall still hoot o'er them : Nor mayors shall know where to seek a nest , Till Gaily Knight shall find one for them ;— Till mayors and kings , with none to rue ‘ em , Shall perish all in one common plague ; And the sovereigns of Belfast and Tuam Must join their brother , Charles Dix , at Prague . Thus mused I , in my chair , alone , ( As above described ) till dozy grown , And nodding assent to my own opinions , I found myself borne to sleep 's dominions , Where , lo ! before my dreaming eyes , A new House of Commons appeared to rise , Whose living contents , to fancy 's survey , Seemed to me all turned topsy-turvy — A jumble of polypi — nobody knew Which was the head or which the queue . Here , Inglis , turned to a sansculotte , Was dancing the hays with Hume and Grote ; There , ripe for riot , Recorder Shaw Was learning from Roebuck “ Çaira : ” While Stanley and Graham , as poissarde wenches , Screamed “ à-bas ! ” from the Tory benches ; And Peel and O'Connell , cheek by jowl , Were dancing an Irish carmagnole . The Lord preserve us !— if dreams come true , What is this hapless realm to do ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>These verses were written in reference to the Bill brought in at this time , for the reform of Corporations , and the sweeping amendments proposed by Lord Lyndhurst and other Tory Peers , in order to obstruct the measure . ANTICIPATED MEETING OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION IN THE YEAR 1836 . 1836 After some observations from Dr. M'Grig On that fossil reliquium called Petrified Wig , Or Perruquolithus — a specimen rare Of those wigs made for antediluvian wear , Which , it seems , stood the Flood without turning a hair — Mr. Tomkins rose up , and requested attention To facts no less wondrous which he had to mention . Some large fossil creatures had lately been found , Of a species no longer now seen above ground , But the same ( as to Tomkins most clearly appears ) With those animals , lost now for hundreds of years , Which our ancestors used to call “ Bishops ” and “ Peers , ” But which Tomkins more erudite names has bestowed on , Having called the Peer fossil the Aris-tocratodon ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>And , finding much food under t'other one 's thorax , Has christened that creature the Episcopus Vorax . Lest the savantes and dandies should think this all fable , Mr. Tomkins most kindly produced , on the table , A sample of each of these species of creatures , Both tolerably human , in structure and features , Except that the Episcopus seems , Lord deliver us ! To 've been carnivorous as well as granivorous ; And Tomkins , on searching its stomach , found there Large lumps , such as no modern stomach could bear , Of a substance called Tithe , upon which , as ‘ tis said , The whole Genus Clericum formerly fed ; And which having lately himself decompounded , Just to see what ‘ twas made of , he actually found it Composed of all possible cookable things That e'er tript upon trotters or soared upon wings — All products of earth , both gramineous , herbaceous , Hordeaceous , fabaceous and eke farinaceous , All clubbing their quotas , to glut the oesophagus Of this ever greedy and grasping Tithophagus .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>“ Admire , ” exclaimed Tomkins . “ the kind dispensation “ By Providence shed on this much-favored nation , “ In sweeping so ravenous a race from the earth , “ That might else have occasioned a general dearth — “ And thus burying ‘ em , deep as even Joe Hume would sink ‘ em , “ With the Ichthyosaurus and Paloeorynchum , “ And other queer ci-devant things , under ground — “ Not forgetting that fossilized youth ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>so renowned , “ Who lived just to witness the Deluge — was gratified “ Much by the sight , and has since been found stratified ! ” This picturesque touch — quite in Tomkins 's way — Called forth from the savantes a general hurrah ; While inquiries among them , went rapidly round , As to where this young stratified man could be found . The “ learned Theban 's ” discourse next as livelily flowed on , To sketch t'other wonder , the Aristocratodon — An animal , differing from most human creatures Not so much in speech , inward structure or features , As in having a certain excrescence , T. said , Which in form of a coronet grew from its head , And devolved to its heirs , when the creature was dead ; Nor mattered it , while this heirloom was transmitted , How unfit were the heads , so the coronet fitted . He then mentioned a strange zoölogical fact , Whose announcement appeared much applause to attract . In France , said the learned professor , this race Had so noxious become , in some centuries ’ space , From their numbers and strength , that the land was o'errun with ‘ em , Every one 's question being , “ What 's to be done with em ? ” When , lo ! certain knowing ones — savans , mayhap , Who , like Buckland 's deep followers , understood trap ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Slyly hinted that naught upon earth was so good For Aristocratodons , when rampant and rude , As to stop or curtail their allowance of food . This expedient was tried and a proof it affords Of the effect that short commons will have upon lords ; For this whole race of bipeds , one fine summer 's morn , Shed their coronets , just as a deer sheds his horn , And the moment these gewgaws fell off , they became Quite a new sort of creature — so harmless and tame , That zoölogists might , for the first time , maintain ‘ em To be near akin to the genius humanum , And the experiment , tried so successfully then , Should be kept in remembrance when wanted again .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>A term formed on the model of the Mastodon , etc .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The zoölogical term for a tithe-eater .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The man found by Scheuchzer , and supposed by him to have witnessed the Deluge ( “ homo diluvii testis ” ) , but who turned out , I am sorry to say , to be merely a great lizard .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Particularly the formation called Transition Trap . SONG OF THE CHURCH . No . 1 . LEAVE ME ALONE . A PASTORAL BALLAD . “ We are ever standing on the defensive . All that we say to them is , ‘ leave us alone . ’ The Established Church is part and parcel of the constitution of this country . You are bound to conform to this constitution . We ask of you nothing more :— let us alone . ” — Letter in The Times , Nov. 1838 . 1838 . Come , list to my pastoral tones , In clover my shepherds I keep ; My stalls are well furnisht with drones , Whose preaching invites one to sleep . At my spirit let infidels scoff , So they leave but the substance my own ; For in sooth I 'm extremely well off If the world will but let me alone . Dissenters are grumblers , we know ;— Tho ’ excellent men in their way , They never like things to be so , Let things be however they may . But dissenting 's a trick I detest ; And besides ‘ tis an axiom well known , The creed that 's best paid is the best , If the unpaid would let it alone . To me , I own , very surprising Your Newmans and Puseys all seem , Who start first with rationalizing , Then jump to the other extreme . Far better , ‘ twixt nonsense and sense , A nice half-way concern , like our own , Where piety 's mixt up with pence , And the latter are ne'er left alone . Of all our tormentors , the Press is The one that most tears us to bits ; And now , Mrs. Woolfrey 's “ excesses ” Have thrown all its imps into fits . The devils have been at us , for weeks , And there 's no saying when they 'll have done ;— Oh dear ! how I wish Mr. Breeks Had left Mrs. Woolfrey alone ! If any need pray for the dead , ‘ Tis those to whom post-obits fall ; Since wisely hath Solomon said , ‘ Tis “ money that answereth all . ” But ours be the patrons who live ; -  For , once in their glebe they are thrown , The dead have no living to give , And therefore we leave them alone . Tho ’ in morals we may not excel , Such perfection is rare to be had ; A good life is , of course , very well , But good living is also-not bad . And when , to feed earth-worms , I go . Let this epitaph stare from my stone , “ Here lies the Right Rev . so and so ; “ Pass , stranger , and — leave him alone . ” EPISTLE FROM HENRY OF EXETER TO JOHN OF TUAM . Dear John , as I know , like our brother of London , You 've sipt of all knowledge , both sacred and mundane , No doubt , in some ancient Joe Miller , you 've read What Cato , that cunning old Roman , once said — That he ne'er saw two reverend sooth-say ers meet , Let it be where it might , in the shrine or the street , Without wondering the rogues , mid their solemn grimaces , Didn  t burst out a laughing in each other 's faces . What Cato then meant , tho ’ ‘ tis so long ago , Even we in the present times pretty well know ; Having soothsayers also , who — sooth to say , John — Are no better in some points than those of days gone , And a pair of whom , meeting ( between you and me ) , Might laugh in their sleeves , too — all lawn tho ’ they be . But this , by the way — my intention being chiefly In this , my first letter , to hint to you briefly , That , seeing how fond you of Tuum<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>must be , While Meum 's at all times the main point with me , We scarce could do better than form an alliance , To set these sad Anti-Church times at defiance : You , John , recollect , being still to embark , With no share in the firm but your title and mark ; Or even should you feel in your grandeur inclined To call yourself Pope , why , I shouldn  t much mind ; While my church as usual holds fast by your Tuum , And every one else 's , to make it all Suum . Thus allied , I 've no doubt we shall nicely agree , As no twins can be liker , in most points , than we ; Both , specimens choice of that mixt sort of beast , ( See Rev . xiii . I ) a political priest : Both mettlesome chargers , both brisk pamphleteers , Ripe and ready for all that sets men by the ears ; And I , at least one , who would scorn to stick longer By any given cause than I found it the stronger , And who , smooth in my turnings , as if on a swivel , When the tone ecclesiastic won  t do , try the civil . In short ( not to bore you , even jure divino ) We 've the same cause in common , John — all but the rhino ; And that vulgar surplus , whate'er it may be , As you 're not used to cash , John , you 'd best leave to me . And so , without form — as the postman won  t tarry — I 'm , dear Jack of Tuain , Yours , EXETER HARRY .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>So spelled in those ancient versicles which John , we understand , frequently chants :— “ Had every one Suum , You wouldn  t have Tuum , But I should have Meum , And sing Te Deum . ” SONG OF OLD PUCK . “ And those things do best please me , That befall preposterously . ” PUCK Junior , Midsummer Night 's Dream . Who wants old Puck ? for here am I , A mongrel imp , ‘ twixt earth and sky , Ready alike to crawl or fly ; Now in the mud , now in the air , And , so ‘ tis for mischief , reckless where . As to my knowledge , there 's no end to't , For , where I have n't it , I pretend to't : And , ‘ stead of taking a learned degree At some dull university , Puck found it handier to commence With a certain share of impudence , Which passes one off as learned and clever , Beyond all other degrees whatever ; And enables a man of lively sconce To be Master of all the Arts at once . No matter what the science may be — Ethics , Physics , Theology , Mathematics , Hydrostatics , Aerostatics or Pneumatics — Whatever it be , I take my luck , ‘ Tis all the same to ancient Puck ; Whose head 's so full of all sorts of wares , That a brother imp , old Smugden , swears If I had but of law a little smattering , I 'd then be perfect — which is flattering . My skill as a linguist all must know Who met me abroad some months ago ; ( And heard me abroad exceedingly , In the moods and tenses of parlez vous ) When , as old Chambaud 's shade stood mute , I spoke such French to the Institute As puzzled those learned Thebans much , To know if ‘ twas Sanscrit or High Dutch , And might have past with the unobserving As one of the unknown tongues of Irving . As to my talent for ubiquity , There 's nothing like it in all antiquity . Like Mungo ( my peculiar care ) “ I 'm here , I 'm dere , I 'm ebery where . ” If any one 's wanted to take the chair Upon any subject , any where , Just look around , and — Puck is there ! When slaughter 's at hand , your bird of prey Is never known to be out of the way : And wherever mischief 's to be got , There 's Puck instanter , on the spot . Only find me in negus and applause , And I 'm your man for any cause . If wrong the cause , the more my delight ; But I don  t object to it , even when right , If I only can vex some old friend by't ; There 's Durham , for instance ;— to worry him Fills up my cup of bliss to the brim ! ( NOTE BY THE EDITOR . ) Those who are anxious to run a muck Can  t do better than join with Puck . They 'll find him bon diable — spite of his phiz — And , in fact , his great ambition is , While playing old Puck in first-rate style , To be thought Robin Good-fellow all the while . POLICE REPORTS . CASE OF IMPOSTURE . Among other stray flashmen disposed of , this week , Was a youngster named Stanley , genteelly connected , Who has lately been passing off coins as antique , Which have proved to be sham ones , tho ’ long unsuspected . The ancients , our readers need hardly be told , Had a coin they called “ Talents , ” for wholesale demands ; And ‘ twas some of said coinage this youth was so bold As to fancy he 'd got , God knows how , in his hands . People took him , however , like fools , at his word ; And these talents ( all prized at his own valuation ,) Were bid for , with eagerness even more absurd Than has often distinguisht this great thinking nation . Talk of wonders one now and then sees advertised , “ Black swans ” — “ Queen Anne farthings ” — or even “ a child 's caul ” — Much and justly as all these rare objects are prized , “ Stanley 's talents ” outdid them — swans , farthings and all ! At length some mistrust of this coin got abroad ; Even quondam believers began much to doubt of it ; Some rung it , some rubbed it , suspecting a fraud — And the hard rubs it got rather took the shine out of it . Others , wishing to break the poor prodigy 's fall , Said ‘ twas known well to all who had studied the matter , That the Greeks had not only great talents but small , And those found on the youngster were clearly the latter . While others who viewed the grave farce with a grin — Seeing counterfeits pass thus for coinage so massy , By way of a hint to the dolts taken in , Appropriately quoted Budaeus “ de Asse . ” In short , the whole sham by degrees was found out , And this coin which they chose by such fine names to call , Proved a mere lackered article — showy , no doubt , But , ye gods ! not the true Attic Talent at all . As the impostor was still young enough to repent , And , besides , had some claims to a grandee connection , Their Worships — considerate for once — only sent The young Thimblerig off to the House of Correction .

    <p>ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE OF THE CHURCH IN THE LAST NUMBER OF The Quarterly Review . I 'm quite of your mind ;— tho ’ these Pats cry aloud That they 've got “ too much Church , ” ‘ tis all nonsense and stuff ; For Church is like Love , of which Figaro vowed That even too much of it 's not quite enough . Ay ! dose them with parsons , ‘ twill cure all their ills ;— Copy Morrison 's mode when from pill-box undaunted he Pours thro ’ the patient his black-coated pills , Nor cares what their quality , so there 's but quantity . I verily think ‘ twould be worth England 's while To consider , for Paddy 's own benefit , whether ‘ Twould not be as well to give up the green isle To the care , wear and tear of the Church altogether . The Irish are well used to treatment so pleasant ; The harlot Church gave them to Henry Plantagenet ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>And now if King William would make them a present To t'other chaste lady — ye Saints , just imagine it ! Chief Secs ., Lord-Lieutenants , Commanders-in-chief , Might then all be culled from the episcopal benches ; While colonels in black would afford some relief From the hue that reminds one of the old scarlet wench 's . Think how fierce at a charge ( being practised therein ) The Right Reverend Brigadier Phillpotts would slash on ! How General Blomfield , thro ’ thick and thro ’ thin , To the end of the chapter ( or chapters ) would dash on ! For in one point alone do the amply fed race Of bishops to beggars similitude bear — That , set them on horseback , in full steeple chase , And they 'll ride , if not pulled up in time — you know where . But , bless you ! in Ireland , that matters not much , Where affairs have for centuries gone the same way ; And a good stanch Conservative 's system is such That he 'd back even Beelzebub 's long-founded sway . I am therefore , dear Quarterly , quite of your mind ;— Church , Church , in all shapes , into Erin let 's pour : And the more she rejecteth our medicine so kind . The more let 's repeat it — “ Black dose , as before . ” Let Coercion , that peace-maker , go hand in hand With demure-eyed Conversion , fit sister and brother ; And , covering with prisons and churches the land , All that wo n't go to one , we 'll put into the other . For the sole , leading maxim of us who 're inclined To rule over Ireland , not well but religiously , Is to treat her like ladies who 've just been confined ( Or who ought to be so ) , and to church her prodigiously .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Grant of Ireland to Henry II . by Pope Adrian . NEW GRAND EXHIBITION OF MODELS OF THE TWO HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT . Come , step in , gentlefolks , here ye may view An exact and natural representation ( Like Siburn 's Model of Waterloo [ 1 ]) Of the Lords and Commons of this here nation . There they are — all cut out in cork — The “ Collective Wisdom ” wondrous to see ; My eyes ! when all them heads are at work , What a vastly weighty consarn it must be . As for the “ wisdom , ” — that may come anon ; Tho ’ , to say truth , we sometimes see ( And I find the phenomenon no uncommon ‘ un ) A man who 's M. P . with a head that 's M. T . Our Lords are rather too small , ‘ tis true ; But they do well enough for Cabinet shelves ; And , besides ,— what 's a man with creeturs to do That make such werry small figures themselves ? There — don  t touch those lords , my pretty dears — ( Aside . ) Curse the children !— this comes of reforming a nation : Those meddling young brats have so damaged my peers , I must lay in more cork for a new creation . Them yonder 's our bishops — “ to whom much is given , ” And who 're ready to take as much more as you please : The seers of old time saw visions of heaven , But these holy seers see nothing but Sees . Like old Atlas [ 2 ]( the chap , in Cheapside , there below ,) ‘ Tis for so much per cent , they take heaven on their shoulders ; And joy ‘ tis to know that old High Church and Co ., Tho ’ not capital priests , are such capital-holders . There 's one on ‘ em , Phillpotts , who now is away , As we 're having him filled with bumbustible stuff , Small crackers and squibs , for a great gala-day , When we annually fire his Right Reverence off . ‘ Twould do your heart good , ma'am , then to be by , When , bursting with gunpowder , ‘ stead of with bile , Crack , crack , goes the bishop , while dowagers cry , “ How like the dear man , both in matter and style ! ” Should you want a few Peers and M. P. s , to bestow , As presents to friends , we can recommend these :— Our nobles are come down to nine-pence , you know , And we charge but a penny a piece for M. P. s . Those of bottle-corks made take most with the trade , ( At least ‘ mong such as my Irish writ summons ,) Of old whiskey corks our O'Connells are made , But those we make Shaws and Lefroys of , are rum ‘ uns . So , step in , gentlefolks , etc . Da Capo .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>One of the most interesting and curious of all the exhibitions of the day .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The sign of the Insurance Office in Cheapside . ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW GRAND ACCELERATION COMPANY FOR THE PROMOTION OF THE SPEED OF LITERATURE . Loud complaints being made in these quick-reading times , Of too slack a supply both of prose works and rhymes , A new Company , formed on the keep-moving plan , First proposed by the great firm of Catch - ‘ em-who-can , Beg to say they 've now ready , in full wind and speed , Some fast-going authors , of quite a new breed — Such as not he who runs but who gallops may read — And who , if well curried and fed , they 've no doubt , Will beat even Bentley 's swift stud out and out . It is true in these days such a drug is renown , We 've “ Immortals ” as rife as M. P. s about town ; And not a Blue 's rout but can offhand supply Some invalid bard who 's insured “ not to die . ” Still let England but once try our authors , she 'll find How fast they 'll leave even these Immortals behind ; And how truly the toils of Alcides were light , Compared with his toil who can read all they write . In fact there 's no saying , so gainful the trade , How fast immortalities now may be made ; Since Helicon never will want an “ Undying One , ” As long as the public continues a Buying One ; And the company hope yet to witness the hour . When , by strongly applying the mare-motive<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>power , A three-decker novel , midst oceans of praise , May be written , launched , read and — forgot , in three days ! In addition to all this stupendous celerity , Which — to the no small relief of posterity — Pays off at sight the whole debit of fame , Nor troubles futurity even with a name ( A project that won  t as much tickle Tom Tegg as us , Since ‘ twill rob him of his second-priced Pegasus ) ; We , the Company — still more to show how immense Is the power o'er the mind of pounds , shillings , and pence ; And that not even Phoebus himself , in our day , Could get up a lay without first an out-lay — Beg to add , as our literature soon may compare , In its quick make and vent , with our Birmingham ware , And it doesn  t at all matter in either of these lines , How sham is the article , so it but shines ,— We keep authors ready , all perched , pen in hand , To write off , in any given style , at command . No matter what bard , be he living or dead , Ask a work from his pen , and ‘ tis done soon as said : There being on the establishment six Walter Scotts , One capital Wordsworth and Southeys in lots ;— Three choice Mrs. Nortons , all singing like syrens , While most of our pallid young clerks are Lord Byrons . Then we 've *** s and *** s ( for whom there 's small call ) , And *** s and *** s ( for whom no call at all ) . In short , whosoe'er the last “ Lion ” may be , We 've a Bottom who 'll copy his roar<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>to a T , And so well , that not one of the buyers who 've got ‘ em Can tell which is lion , and which only Bottom . N . B .— The company , since they set up in this line , Have moved their concern and are now at the sign Of the Muse 's Velocipede , Fleet Street , where all Who wish well to the scheme are invited to call .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ ‘ Tis money makes the mare to go . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>“ Bottom : Let me play the lion ; I will roar you as ‘ twere any nightingale . ” SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LATE DINNER TO DAN . From tongue to tongue the rumor flew ; All askt , aghast , “ Is't true ? is't true ? ” But none knew whether ‘ twas fact or fable : And still the unholy rumor ran , From Tory woman to Tory man , Tho ’ none to come at the truth was able — Till , lo ! at last , the fact came out , The horrible fact , beyond all doubt , That Dan had dined at the Viceroy 's table ; Had flesht his Popish knife and fork In the heart of the Establisht mutton and pork ! Who can forget the deep sensation That news produced in this orthodox nation ? Deans , rectors , curates , all agreed , If Dan was allowed at the Castle to feed , ‘ Twas clearly all up with the Protestant creed ! There hadn  t indeed such an apparition Been heard of in Dublin since that day When , during the first grand exhibition Of Don Giovanni , that naughty play , There appeared , as if raised by necromancers , An extra devil among the dancers ! Yes — every one saw with fearful thrill That a devil too much had joined the quadrille ; And sulphur was smelt and the lamps let fall A grim , green light o'er the ghastly ball , And the poor sham devils didn  t like it at all ; For they knew from whence the intruder had come , Tho ’ he left , that night , his tail at home . This fact , we see , is a parallel case To the dinner that some weeks since took place . With the difference slight of fiend and man , It shows what a nest of Popish sinners That city must be , where the devil and Dan May thus drop in at quadrilles and dinners ! But mark the end of these foul proceedings , These demon hops and Popish feedings . Some comfort ‘ twill be — to those , at least , Who 've studied this awful dinner question — To know that Dan , on the night of that feast , Was seized with a dreadful indigestion ; That envoys were sent post-haste to his priest To come and absolve the suffering sinner , For eating so much at a heretic dinner ; And some good people were even afraid That Peel 's old confectioner — still at the trade — Had poisoned the Papist with orangeade . NEW HOSPITAL FOR SICK LITERATI . With all humility we beg To inform the public , that Tom Tegg — Known for his spunky speculations In buying up dead reputations , And by a mode of galvanizing Which , all must own , is quite surprising , Making dead authors move again , As tho ’ they still were living men ;— All this too managed , in a trice , By those two magic words , “ Half Price , ” Which brings the charm so quick about , That worn-out poets , left without A second foot whereon to stand , Are made to go at second hand ;— ‘ Twill please the public , we repeat , To learn that Tegg who works this feat , And therefore knows what care it needs To keep alive Fame 's invalids , Has oped an Hospital in town , For cases of knockt-up renown — Falls , fractures , dangerous Epic fits ( By some called Cantoes ) , stabs from wits ; And of all wounds for which they 're nurst , Dead cuts from publishers , the worst ;— All these , and other such fatalities , That happen to frail immortalities , By Tegg are so expertly treated , That oft-times , when the cure 's completed , The patient 's made robust enough To stand a few more rounds of puff , Till like the ghosts of Dante 's lay He 's puft into thin air away ! As titled poets ( being phenomenons ) Don  t like to mix with low and common ‘ uns , Tegg 's Hospital has separate wards , Express for literary lords , Where prose-peers , of immoderate length , Are nurst , when they 've outgrown their strength , And poets , whom their friends despair of , Are — put to bed and taken care of . Tegg begs to contradict a story Now current both with Whig and Tory , That Doctor Warburton , M. P ., Well known for his antipathy , His deadly hate , good man , to all The race of poets great and small — So much , that he 's been heard to own , He would most willingly cut down The holiest groves on Pindus ’ mount , To turn the timber to account !— The story actually goes , that he Prescribes at Tegg 's Infirmary ; And oft not only stints for spite The patients in their copy-right , But that , on being called in lately To two sick poets suffering greatly , This vaticidal Doctor sent them So strong a dose of Jeremy Bentham , That one of the poor bards but cried , “ Oh , Jerry , Jerry ! ” and then died ; While t'other , tho ’ less stuff was given , Is on his road , ‘ tis feared , to heaven ! Of this event , howe'er unpleasant , Tegg means to say no more at present ,— Intending shortly to prepare A statement of the whole affair , With full accounts , at the same time , Of some late cases ( prose and rhyme ) , Subscribed with every author 's name , That 's now on the Sick List of Fame . RELIGION AND TRADE . “ Sir Robert Peel believed it was necessary to originate all respecting religion and trade in a Committee of the House . ” — Church Extension , May 22 , 1830 . Say , who was the wag , indecorously witty , Who first in a statute this libel conveyed ; And thus slyly referred to the selfsame committee , As matters congenial , Religion and Trade ? Oh surely , my Phillpotts , ‘ twas thou didst the deed ; For none but thyself or some pluralist brother , Accustomed to mix up the craft with the creed , Could bring such a pair thus to twin with each other . And yet , when one thinks of times present and gone , One is forced to confess on maturer reflection That ‘ tis n't in the eyes of committees alone That the shrine and the shop seem to have some connection . Not to mention those monarchs of Asia 's fair land , Whose civil list all is in “ god-money ” paid ; And where the whole people , by royal command , Buy their gods at the government mart , ready made ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>— There was also ( as mentioned , in rhyme and in prose , is ) Gold heaped throughout Egypt on every shrine , To make rings for right reverend crocodiles ’ noses — Just such as , my Phillpotts , would look well in thine . But one need n't fly off in this erudite mood ; And ‘ tis clear without going to regions so sunny That priests love to do the least possible good For the largest most possible quantum of money . “ Of him , ” saith the text , “ unto whom much is given , “ Of him much , in turn , will be also required : ” — “ By me , ” quoth the sleek and obese man of heaven — “ Give as much as you will — more will still be desired . ” More money ! more churches !— oh Nimrod , hadst thou ‘ Stead of Tower-extension , some shorter way gone — Hadst thou known by what methods we mount to heaven now , And tried Church-extension , the feat had been done !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Birmans may not buy the sacred marble in mass but must purchase figures of the deity already made .— SYMES .

Whether as queens or subjects , in these days , Women seem formed to grace alike each station :— As Captain Flaherty gallantly says , “ You ladies , are the lords of the creation ! ” Thus o'er my mind did prescient visions float Of all that matchless woman yet may be ; When hark ! in rumors less and less remote , Came the glad news o'er Erin 's ambient sea , The important news — that Mrs. Nethercoat Had been appointed jailer of Loughrea ; Yes , mark it , History — Nethercoat is dead , And Mrs. N. now rules his realm instead ; Hers the high task to wield the uplocking keys , To rivet rogues and reign o'er Rapparees ! Thus , while your blusterers of the Tory school Find Ireland 's sanest sons so hard to rule , One meek-eyed matron in Whig doctrines nurst Is all that 's askt to curb the maddest , worst ! Show me the man that dares with blushless brow Prate about Erin 's rage and riot now ; Now , when her temperance forms her sole excess ; When long-loved whiskey , fading from her sight , “ Small by degrees and beautifully less , ” Will soon like other spirits vanish quite ; When of red coats the number 's grown so small , That soon , to cheer the warlike parson 's eyes , No glimpse of scarlet will be seen at all , Save that which she of Babylon supplies ;— Or , at the most , a corporal 's guard will be , Of Ireland 's red defence the sole remains ; While of its jails bright woman keeps the key , And captive Paddies languish in her chains ! Long may such lot be Erin 's , long be mine ! Oh yes — if even this world , tho ’ bright it shine , In Wisdom 's eyes a prison-house must be , At least let woman 's hand our fetters twine , And blithe I 'll sing , more joyous than if free , The Nethercoats , the Nethercoats for me ! INTENDED TRIBUTE TO THE AUTHOR OF AN ARTICLE IN THE LAST NUMBER OF The Quarterly Review , ENTITLED “ ROMANISM IN IRELAND . ” It glads us much to be able to say , That a meeting is fixt for some early day , Of all such dowagers — he or she — ( No matter the sex , so they dowagers be ,) Whose opinions concerning Church and State From about the time of the Curfew date — Stanch sticklers still for days bygone , And admiring them for their rust alone — To whom if we would a leader give , Worthy their tastes conservative , We need but some mummy-statesman raise , Who was pickled and potted in Ptolemy 's days ; For that 's the man , if waked from his shelf , To conserve and swaddle this world like himself . Such , we 're happy to state , are the old he-dames Who 've met in committee and given their names ( In good hieroglyphics ) , with kind intent To pay some handsome compliment To their sister author , the nameless he , Who wrote , in the last new Quarterly , That charming assault upon Popery ; An article justly prized by them As a perfect antediluvian gem — The work , as Sir Sampson Legend would say , Of some “ fellow the Flood couldn  t wash away . "[ 1 ] The fund being raised , there remained but to see What the dowager-author 's gift was to be . And here , I must say , the Sisters Blue Showed delicate taste and judgment too . For finding the poor man suffering greatly From the awful stuff he has thrown up lately — So much so indeed to the alarm of all , As to bring on a fit of what doctors call The Antipapistico-monomania ( I 'm sorry with such a long word to detain ye ) , They 've acted the part of a kind physician , By suiting their gift to the patient 's condition ; And as soon as ‘ tis ready for presentation , We shall publish the facts for the gratification Of this highly-favored and Protestant nation .

GRAND DINNER OF TYPE AND CO. A POOR POET 'S DREAM .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>As I sate in my study , lone and still , Thinking of Sergeant Talfourd 's Bill , And the speech by Lawyer Sugden made , In spirit congenial , for “ the Trade , ” Sudden I sunk to sleep and lo ! Upon Fancy 's reinless nightmare flitting , I found myself , in a second or so , At the table of Messrs . Type and Co. With a goodly group of diners sitting ;— All in the printing and publishing line , Drest , I thought , extremely fine , And sipping like lords their rosy wine ; While I in a state near inanition With coat that had n't much nap to spare ( Having just gone into its second edition ) , Was the only wretch of an author there . But think , how great was my surprise , When I saw , in casting round my eyes , That the dishes , sent up by Type 's she-cooks , Bore all , in appearance , the shape of books ; Large folios — God knows where they got ‘ em , In these small times — at top and bottom ; And quartos ( such as the Press provides For no one to read them ) down the sides . Then flasht a horrible thought on my brain , And I said to myself , “ ‘ Tis all too plain , “ Like those well known in school quotations , “ Who ate up for dinner their own relations , “ I see now , before me , smoking here , “ The bodies and bones of my brethren dear ;— “ Bright sons of the lyric and epic Muse , “ All cut up in cutlets , or hasht in stews ; “ Their works , a light thro ’ ages to go ,— “ Themselves , eaten up by Type and Co .! ” While thus I moralized , on they went , Finding the fare most excellent : And all so kindly , brother to brother , Helping the tidbits to each other : “ A slice of Southey let me send you ” — “ This cut of Campbell I recommend you ” — “ And here , my friends , is a treat indeed , “ The immortal Wordsworth fricasseed ! ” Thus having , the cormorants , fed some time , Upon joints of poetry — all of the prime — With also ( as Type in a whisper averred it ) “ Cold prose on the sideboard , for such as preferred it ” — They rested awhile , to recruit their force , Then pounced , like kites , on the second course , Which was singing-birds merely — Moore and others — Who all went the way of their larger brothers ; And , numerous now tho ’ such songsters be , ‘ Twas really quite distressing to see A whole dishful of Toms — Moore , Dibdin , Bayly ,— Bolted by Type and Co. so gayly ! Nor was this the worst — I shudder to think What a scene was disclosed when they came to drink . The warriors of Odin , as every one knows , Used to drink out of skulls of slaughtered foes : And Type 's old port , to my horror I found , Was in skulls of bards sent merrily round . And still as each well-filled cranium came , A health was pledged to its owner 's name ; While Type said slyly , midst general laughter , “ We eat them up first , then drink to them after . ” There was no standing this — incensed I broke From my bonds of sleep , and indignant woke , Exclaiming , “ Oh shades of other times , “ Whose voices still sound , like deathless chimes , “ Could you e'er have foretold a day would be , “ When a dreamer of dreams should live to see “ A party of sleek and honest John Bulls “ Hobnobbing each other in poets ’ skulls ! ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Written during the late agitation of the question of Copyright . CHURCH EXTENSION . TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING CHRONICLE . Sir — A well-known classical traveller , while employed in exploring , some time since , the supposed site of the Temple of Diana of Ephesus , was so fortunate , in the course of his researches , as to light upon a very ancient bark manuscript , which has turned out , on examination , to be part of an old Ephesian newspaper ;— a newspaper published , as you will see , so far back as the time when Demetrius , the great Shrine-Extender ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>flourished . I am , Sir , yours , etc . EPHESIAN GAZETTE . Second edition . Important event for the rich and religious ! Great Meeting of Silversmiths held in Queen Square ;— Church Extension , their object ,— the excitement prodigious ;— Demetrius , head man of the craft , takes the chair ! Third edition . The Chairman still up , when our devil came away ; Having prefaced his speech with the usual state prayer , That the Three-headed Dian would kindly , this day , Take the Silversmiths ’ Company under her care . Being askt by some low , unestablisht divines , “ When your churches are up , where are flocks to be got ? ” He manfully answered , “ Let us build the shrines ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>“ And we care not if flocks are found for them or not . ” He then added — to show that the Silversmiths ’ Guild Were above all confined and intolerant views — “ Only pay thro ’ the nose to the altars we build , “ You may pray thro ’ the nose to what altars you choose . ” This tolerance , rare from a shrine-dealer 's lip ( Tho ’ a tolerance mixt with due taste for the till ) — So much charmed all the holders of scriptural scrip , That their shouts of “ Hear ! ” “ Hear ! ” are re-echoing still .

LATEST ACCOUNTS FROM OLYMPUS . As news from Olympus has grown rather rare , Since bards , in their cruises , have ceased to touch there , We extract for our readers the intelligence given , In our latest accounts from that ci-devant Heaven — That realm of the By-gones , where still sit in state Old god-heads and nod-heads now long out of date . Jove himself , it appears , since his love-days are o'er , Seems to find immortality rather a bore ; Tho ’ he still asks for news of earth 's capers and crimes , And reads daily his old fellow-Thunderer , the Times . He and Vulcan , it seems , by their wives still hen-peckt are , And kept on a stinted allowance of nectar . Old Phoebus , poor lad , has given up inspiration , And packt off to earth on a puff speculation . The fact is , he found his old shrines had grown dim , Since bards lookt to Bentley and Colburn , not him . So he sold off his stud of ambrosia-fed nags . Came incog . down to earth , and now writes for the Mags ; Taking care that his work not a gleam hath to linger i n't , From which men could guess that the god had a finger i n't . There are other small facts , well deserving attention , Of which our Olympic despatches make mention . Poor Bacchus is still very ill , they allege , Having never recovered the Temperance Pledge . “ What , the Irish ! ” he cried — “ those I lookt to the most ! “ If they give up the spirit , I give up the ghost : ” While Momus , who used of the gods to make fun , Is turned Socialist now and declares there are none ! But these changes , tho ’ curious , are all a mere farce Compared to the new “ casus belli ” of Mars , Who , for years , has been suffering the horrors of quiet , Uncheered by one glimmer of bloodshed or riot ! In vain from the clouds his belligerent brow Did he pop forth , in hopes that somewhere or somehow , Like Pat at a fair , he might “ coax up a row : ” But the joke would n't take — the whole world had got wiser ; Men liked not to take a Great Gun for adviser ; And , still less , to march in fine clothes to be shot , Without very well knowing for whom or for what . The French , who of slaughter had had their full swing , Were content with a shot , now and then , at their King ; While , in England , good fighting 's a pastime so hard to gain , Nobody 's left to fight with , but Lord Cardigan . ‘ Tis needless to say then how monstrously happy Old Mars has been made by what 's now on the tapis ; How much it delights him to see the French rally , In Liberty 's name , around Mehemet Ali ; Well knowing that Satan himself could not find A confection of mischief much more to his mind Than the old Bonnet Rouge and the Bashaw combined . Right well , too , he knows , that there ne'er were attackers , Whatever their cause , that they didn  t find backers ; While any slight care for Humanity 's woes May be soothed by that “ Art Diplomatique , ” which shows How to come in the most approved method to blows . This is all for to-day — whether Mars is much vext At his friend Thiers 's exit , we 'll know by our next . THE TRIUMPHS OF FARCE . Our earth , as it rolls thro ’ the regions of space , Wears always two faces , the dark and the sunny ; And poor human life runs the same sort of race , Being sad on one side — on the other side , funny . Thus oft we , at eve , to the Haymarket hie , To weep o'er the woes of Macready ;— but scarce Hath the tear-drop of Tragedy past from the eye , When lo ! we 're all laughing in fits at the Farce . And still let us laugh — preach the world as it may — Where the cream of the joke is , the swarm will soon follow ; Heroics are very grand things in their way , But the laugh at the long run will carry it hollow . For instance , what sermon on human affairs Could equal the scene that took place t'other day ‘ Twixt Romeo and Louis Philippe , on the stairs — The Sublime and Ridiculous meeting half-way ! Yes , Jocus ! gay god , whom the Gentiles supplied , And whose worship not even among Christians declines , In our senate thou'st languisht since Sheridan died , But Sydney still keeps thee alive in our shrines . Rare Sydney ! thrice honored the stall where he sits , And be his every honor he deigneth to climb at ! Had England a hierarchy formed all of wits , Who but Sydney would England proclaim as its primate ? And long may he flourish , frank , merry and brave — A Horace to hear and a Paschal to read ; While he laughs , all is safe , but , when Sydney grows grave , We shall then think the Church is in danger indeed . Meanwhile it much glads us to find he 's preparing To teach other bishops to “ seek the right way ;"[ 1 ] And means shortly to treat the whole Bench to an airing , Just such as he gave to Charles James t'other day . For our parts , gravity 's good for the soul , Such a fancy have we for the side that there 's fun on , We 'd rather with Sydney southwest take a “ stroll , ” Than coach it north-east with his Lordship of Lunnun .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ This stroll in the metropolis is extremely well contrived for your Lordship 's speech ; but suppose , my dear Lord , that instead of going E. and N. E. you had turned about , ” etc .— SYDNEY SMITH 'S Last Letter to the Bishop of London . THOUGHTS ON PATRONS , PUFFS , AND OTHER MATTERS . IN AN EPISTLE FROM THOMAS MOORE TO SAMUEL ROGERS . What , thou , my friend ! a man of rhymes , And , better still , a man of guineas , To talk of “ patrons , ” in these times , When authors thrive like spinning-jennies , And Arkwright 's twist and Bulwer 's page Alike may laugh at patronage ! No , no — those times are past away , When , doomed in upper floors to star it . The bard inscribed to lords his lay ,— Himself , the while , my Lord Mountgarret . No more he begs with air dependent . His “ little bark may sail attendant ” Under some lordly skipper 's steerage ; But launched triumphant in the Row , Or taken by Murray 's self in tow . Cuts both Star Chamber and the peerage . Patrons , indeed ! when scarce a sail Is whiskt from England by the gale . But bears on board some authors , shipt For foreign shores , all well equipt With proper book-making machinery , To sketch the morals , manners , scenery , Of all such lands as they shall see , Or not see , as the case may be :— It being enjoined on all who go To study first Miss Martineau , And learn from her the method true , [ too . To do one 's books — and readers , For so this nymph of nous and nerve Teaches mankind “ How to Observe ; ” And , lest mankind at all should swerve , Teaches them also “ What to Observe . ” No , no , my friend — it can  t be blinkt — The Patron is a race extinct ; As dead as any Megatherion That ever Buckland built a theory on . Instead of bartering in this age Our praise for pence and patronage , We authors now more prosperous elves , Have learned to patronize ourselves ; And since all-potent Puffing 's made The life of song , the soul of trade . More frugal of our praises grown , We puff no merits but our own . Unlike those feeble gales of praise Which critics blew in former days , Our modern puffs are of a kind That truly , really raise the wind ; And since they 've fairly set in blowing , We find them the best trade-winds going . ‘ Stead of frequenting paths so slippy As her old haunts near Aganippe , The Muse now taking to the till Has opened shop on Ludgate Hill ( Far handier than the Hill of Pindus , As seen from bard 's back attic windows ): And swallowing there without cessation Large draughts ( at sight ) of inspiration , Touches the notes for each new theme , While still fresh “ change comes o'er her dream . ” What Steam is on the deep — and more — Is the vast power of Puff on shore ; Which jumps to glory 's future tenses Before the present even commences ; And makes “ immortal ” and “ divine ” of us Before the world has read one line of us . In old times , when the God of Song Drove his own two-horse team along , Carrying inside a bard or two , Bookt for posterity “ all thro ’ ; ” — Their luggage , a few close-packt rhymes , ( Like yours , my friend ,) for after-times — So slow the pull to Fame 's abode , That folks oft slept upon the road ;— And Homer 's self , sometimes , they say , Took to his night-cap on the way . Ye Gods ! how different is the story With our new galloping sons of glory , Who , scorning all such slack and slow time , Dash to posterity in no time ! Raise but one general blast of Puff To start your author — that 's enough . In vain the critics set to watch him Try at the starting post to catch him : He 's off — the puffers carry it hollow — The critics , if they please , may follow . Ere they 've laid down their first positions , He 's fairly blown thro ’ six editions ! In vain doth Edinburgh dispense Her blue and yellow pestilence ( That plague so awful in my time To young and touchy sons of rhyme ) — The Quarterly , at three months ’ date , To catch the Unread One , comes too late ; And nonsense , littered in a hurry , Becomes “ immortal , ” spite of Murray . But bless me !— while I thus keep fooling , I hear a voice cry , “ Dinner 's cooling . ” That postman too ( who , truth to tell , ‘ Mong men of letters bears the bell ,) Keeps ringing , ringing , so infernally That I must stop — Yours sempiternally . THOUGHTS ON MISCHIEF . BY LORD STANLEY . ( HIS FIRST ATTEMPT IN VERSE . ) “ Evil , be thou my good . ” — MILTON . How various are the inspirations Of different men in different nations ! As genius prompts to good or evil , Some call the Muse , some raise the devil . Old Socrates , that pink of sages , Kept a pet demon on board wages To go about with him incog ., And sometimes give his wits a jog . So Lyndhurst , in our day , we know , Keeps fresh relays of imps below , To forward from that nameless spot ; His inspirations , hot and hot . But , neat as are old Lyndhurst 's doings — Beyond even Hecate 's “ hell-broth ” brewings — Had I , Lord Stanley , but my will , I 'd show you mischief prettier still ; Mischief , combining boyhood 's tricks With age 's sourest politics ; The urchin 's freaks , the veteran 's gall , Both duly mixt , and matchless all ; A compound naught in history reaches But Machiavel , when first in breeches ! Yes , Mischief , Goddess multiform , Whene'er thou , witch-like , ridest the storm , Let Stanley ride cockhorse behind thee — No livelier lackey could they find thee . And , Goddess , as I 'm well aware , So mischief 's done , you care not where , I own , ‘ twill most my fancy tickle In Paddyland to play the Pickle ; Having got credit for inventing A new , brisk method of tormenting — A way they call the Stanley fashion , Which puts all Ireland in a passion ; So neat it hits the mixture due Of injury and insult too ; So legibly it bears upo n't The stamp of Stanley 's brazen front . Ireland , we 're told , means the land of Ire ; And why she 's so , none need inquire , Who sees her millions , martial , manly , Spat upon thus by me , Lord Stanley . Already in the breeze I scent The whiff of coming devilment ; Of strife , to me more stirring far Than the Opium or the Sulphur war , Or any such drug ferments are . Yes — sweeter to this Tory soul Than all such pests , from pole to pole , Is the rich , “ sweltered venom ” got By stirring Ireland 's “ charmed pot ; ” And thanks to practice on that land I stir it with a master-hand . Again thou'lt see , when forth have gone The War-Church-cry , “ On , Stanley , on ! ” How Caravats and Shanavests Shall swarm from out their mountain nests , With all their merry moonlight brothers , To whom the Church ( step-dame to others ) Hath been the best of nursing mothers . Again o'er Erin 's rich domain Shall Rockites and right reverends reign ; And both , exempt from vulgar toil , Between them share that titheful soil ; Puzzling ambition which to climb at , The post of Captain , or of Primate . And so , long life to Church and Co .— Hurrah for mischief !— here we go . EPISTLE FROM CAPTAIN ROCK TO LORD LYNDHURST . Dear Lyndhurst ,— you 'll pardon my making thus free ,— But form is all fudge ‘ twixt such “ comrogues ” as we , Who , whate'er the smooth views we , in public , may drive at , Have both the same praiseworthy object , in private — Namely , never to let the old regions of riot , Where Rock hath long reigned , have one instant of quiet , But keep Ireland still in that liquid we 've taught her To love more than meat , drink , or clothing — hot water . All the difference betwixt you and me , as I take it , Is simply , that you make the law and I break it ; And never , of big-wigs and small , were there two Played so well into each other 's hands as we do ; Insomuch , that the laws you and yours manufacture , Seem all made express for the Rock-boys to fracture . Not Birmingham 's self — to her shame be it spoken — E'er made things more neatly contrived to be broken ; And hence , I confess , in this island religious , The breakage of laws — and of heads is prodigious . And long may it thrive , my Ex-Bigwig , say I ,— Tho ’ , of late , much I feared all our fun was gone by ; As , except when some tithe-hunting parson showed sport , Some rector — a cool hand at pistols and port , Who “ keeps dry ” his powder , but never himself — One who , leaving his Bible to rust on the shelf , Sends his pious texts home , in the shape of ball-cartridges , Shooting his “ dearly beloved , ” like partridges ; Except when some hero of this sort turned out , Or , the Exchequer sent , flaming , its tithe-writs<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>about — A contrivance more neat , I may say , without flattery , Than e'er yet was thought of for bloodshed and battery ; So neat , that even I might be proud , I allow , To have bit off so rich a receipt for a row ;— Except for such rigs turning up , now and then , I was actually growing the dullest of men ; And , had this blank fit been allowed to increase , Might have snored myself down to a Justice of Peace . Like you , Reformation in Church and in State Is the thing of all things I most cordially hate . If once these curst Ministers do as they like , All 's o'er , my good Lord , with your wig and my pike , And one may be hung up on t'other , henceforth , Just to show what such Captains and Chancellors were worth . But we must not despair — even already Hope sees You 're about , my bold Baron , to kick up a breeze Of the true baffling sort , such as suits me and you , Who have boxt the whole compass of party right thro ’ , And care not one farthing , as all the world knows , So we but raise the wind , from what quarter it blows . Forgive me , dear Lord , that thus rudely I dare My own small resources with thine to compare : Not even Jerry Diddler , in “ raising the wind , ” durst Complete , for one instant , with thee , my dear Lyndhurst . But , hark , there 's a shot !— some parsonic practitioner ? No — merely a bran-new Rebellion Commissioner ; The Courts having now , with true law erudition , Put even Rebellion itself “ in commission . ” As seldom , in this way , I 'm any man 's debtor , I 'll just pay my shot and then fold up this letter . In the mean time , hurrah for the Tories and Rocks ! Hurrah for the parsons who fleece well their flocks ! Hurrah for all mischief in all ranks and spheres , And , above all , hurrah for that dear House of Peers !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Exchequer tithe processes , served under a commission of rebellion .— Chronicle . CAPTAIN ROCK IN LONDON . LETTER FROM THE CAPTAIN TO TERRY ALT , ESQ .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Here I am , at headquarters , dear Terry , once more , Deep in Tory designs , as I 've oft been before : For , bless them ! if ‘ twas n't for this wrong-headed crew , You and I , Terry Alt , would scarce know what to do ; So ready they 're always , when dull we are growing , To set our old concert of discord a-going , While Lyndhurst 's the lad , with his Tory-Whig face , To play in such concert the true double-base . I had feared this old prop of my realm was beginning To tire of his course of political sinning , And , like Mother Cole , when her heyday was past , Meant by way of a change to try virtue at last . But I wronged the old boy , who as staunchly derides All reform in himself as in most things besides ; And , by using two faces thro ’ life , all allow , Has acquired face sufficient for any-thing now . In short , he 's all right ; and , if mankind 's old foe , My “ Lord Harry ” himself — who 's the leader , we know , Of another red-hot Opposition below — If that “ Lord , ” in his well-known discernment , but spares Me and Lyndhurst , to look after Ireland 's affairs , We shall soon such a region of devilment make it , That Old Nick himself for his own may mistake it . Even already — long life to such Bigwigs , say I , For , as long as they flourish , we Rocks cannot die — He has served our right riotous cause by a speech Whose perfection of mischief he only could reach ; As it shows off both his and my merits alike , Both the swell of the wig and the point of the pike ; Mixes up , with a skill which one can  t but admire , The lawyer 's cool craft with the incendiary 's fire , And enlists , in the gravest , most plausible manner , Seven millions of souls under Rockery 's banner ! Oh Terry , my man , let this speech never die ; Thro ’ the regions of Rockland , like flame , let it fly ; Let each syllable dark the Law-Oracle uttered By all Tipperary 's wild echoes be muttered . Till naught shall be heard , over hill , dale or flood , But “ You 're aliens in language , in creed and in blood ; ” While voices , from sweet Connemara afar , Shall answer , like true Irish echoes , “ We are ! ” And , tho ’ false be the cry , and the sense must abhor it , Still the echoes may quote Law authority for it , And naught Lyndhurst cares for my spread of dominion So he , in the end , touches cash “ for the opinion . ” But I 've no time for more , my dear Terry , just now , Being busy in helping these Lords thro ’ their row . They 're bad hands at mob-work , but once they begin , They 'll have plenty of practice to break them well in .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The subordinate officer or lieutenant of Captain Rock . POLITICAL AND SATIRICAL POEMS . LINES ON THE DEATH OF MR. PERCEVAL . In the dirge we sung o'er him no censure was heard , Unembittered and free did the tear-drop descend ; We forgot , in that hour , how the statesman had erred , And wept for the husband , the father and friend . Oh ! proud was the meed his integrity won , And generous indeed were the tears that we shed , When in grief we forgot all the ill he had done , And tho ’ wronged by him living , bewailed him , when dead . Even now if one harsher emotion intrude , ‘ Tis to wish he had chosen some lowlier state , Had known what he was — and , content to be good , Had ne'er for our ruin aspired to be great . So , left thro ’ their own little orbit to move , His years might have rolled inoffensive away ; His children might still have been blest with his love , And England would ne'er have been curst with his sway .</p>

    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF “ THE MORNING CHRONICLE . ” Sir ,— In order to explain the following Fragment , it is necessary to refer your readers to a late florid description of the Pavilion at Brighton , in the apartments of which , we are told , “ FUM , The Chinese Bird of Royalty , ” is a principal ornament .

One day the Chinese Bird of Royalty , FUM , Thus accosted our own Bird of Royalty , HUM , In that Palace or China-shop ( Brighton , which is it ? ) Where FUM had just come to pay HUM a short visit .— Near akin are these Birds , tho ’ they differ in nation ( The breed of the HUMS is as old as creation ) ; Both , full-crawed Legitimates — both , birds of prey , Both , cackling and ravenous creatures , half way ‘ Twixt the goose and the vulture , like Lord Castlereagh . While FUM deals in Mandarins Bonzes , Bohea , Peers , Bishops and Punch , HUM .— are sacred to thee So congenial their tastes , that , when FUM first did light on The floor of that grand China-warehouse at Brighton , The lanterns and dragons and things round the dome Where so like what he left , “ Gad , ” says FUM , “ I 'm at home , ” — And when , turning , he saw Bishop L — GE , “ Zooks , it is . ” Quoth the Bird , “ Yes — I know him — a Bonze , by his phiz - “ And that jolly old idol he kneels to so low “ Can be none but our round-about god-head , fat Fo ! ” It chanced at this moment , the Episcopal Prig Was imploring the Prince to dispense with his wig ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Which the Bird , overhearing , flew high o'er his head , And some TOBIT-like marks of his patronage shed , Which so dimmed the poor Dandy 's idolatrous eye , That , while FUM cried “ Oh Fo ! ” all the court cried “ Oh fie ! ” But a truce to digression ;— these Birds of a feather Thus talkt , t'other night , on State matters together ; ( The PRINCE just in bed , or about to depart for't , His legs full of gout , and his arms full of HARTFORD ,) “ I say , HUM , ” says FUM — FUM , of course , spoke Chinese , But , bless you ! that 's nothing — at Brighton one sees Foreign lingoes and Bishops translated with ease — “ I say , HUM , how fares it with Royalty now ? “ Is it up ? is it prime ? is it spooney-or how ? ” ( The Bird had just taken a flash-man 's degree Under BARRYMORE , YARMOUTH , and young Master L — E ,) “ As for us in Pekin ” — here , a devil of a din From the bed-chamber came , where that long Mandarin , Castlereagh ( whom FUM calls the Confucius of Prose ) , Was rehearsing a speech upon Europe 's repose To the deep , double bass of the fat Idol 's nose .

Dear Lord Byron ,— Though this Volume should possess no other merit in your eyes , than that of reminding you of the short time we passed together at Venice , when some of the trifles which it contains were written , you will , I am sure , receive the dedication of it with pleasure , and believe that I am , My dear Lord , Ever faithfully yours , T. B . PREFACE . Though it was the wish of the Members of the Poco-curante Society ( who have lately done me the honor of electing me their Secretary ) that I should prefix my name to the following Miscellany , it is but fair to them and to myself to state , that , except in the “ painful pre-eminence ” of being employed to transcribe their lucubrations , my claim to such a distinction in the title-page is not greater than that of any other gentleman , who has contributed his share to the contents of the volume . I had originally intended to take this opportunity of giving some account of the origin and objects of our Institution , the names and characters of the different members , etc .— but as I am at present preparing for the press the First Volume of the “ Transactions of the Pococurante Society , ” I shall reserve for that occasion all further details upon the subject , and content myself here with referring , for a general insight into our tenets , to a Song which will be found at the end of this work and which is sung to us on the first day of every month , by one of our oldest members , to the tune of ( as far as I can recollect , being no musician ,) either “ Nancy Dawson ” or “ He stole away the Bacon . ” It may be as well also to state for the information of those critics who attack with the hope of being answered , and of being thereby brought into notice , that it is the rule of this Society to return no other answer to such assailants , than is contained in the three words “ non curat Hippoclides ” ( meaning , in English , “ Hippoclides does not care a fig , ” ) which were spoken two thousand years ago by the first founder of Poco - curantism , and have ever since been adopted as the leading dictum of the sect . THOMAS BROWN . FABLES FOR THE HOLY ALLIANCE . FABLE I . THE DISSOLUTION OF THE HOLY ALLIANCE . A DREAM . I 've had a dream that bodes no good Unto the Holy Brotherhood . I may be wrong , but I confess — As far as it is right or lawful For one , no conjurer , to guess — It seems to me extremely awful . Methought , upon the Neva 's flood A beautiful Ice Palace stood , A dome of frost-work , on the plan Of that once built by Empress Anne ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Which shone by moonlight — as the tale is — Like an Aurora Borealis . In this said Palace , furnisht all And lighted as the best on land are , I dreamt there was a splendid Ball , Given by the Emperor Alexander , To entertain with all due zeal , Those holy gentlemen , who 've shown a Regard so kind for Europe 's weal , At Troppau , Laybach and Verona . The thought was happy — and designed To hint how thus the human Mind May , like the stream imprisoned there , Be checkt and chilled , till it can bear The heaviest Kings , that ode or sonnet E'er yet be-praised , to dance upon it . And all were pleased and cold and stately , Shivering in grand illumination — Admired the superstructure greatly , Nor gave one thought to the foundation . Much too the Tsar himself exulted , To all plebeian fears a stranger , For , Madame Krudener , when consulted , Had pledged her word there was no danger So , on he capered , fearless quite , Thinking himself extremely clever , And waltzed away with all his might , As if the Frost would last forever . Just fancy how a bard like me , Who reverence monarchs , must have trembled To see that goodly company , At such a ticklish sport assembled . Nor were the fears , that thus astounded My loyal soul , at all unfounded — For , lo ! ere long , those walls so massy Were seized with an ill-omened dripping , And o'er the floors , now growing glassy , Their Holinesses took to slipping . The Tsar , half thro ’ a Polonaise , Could scarce get on for downright stumbling ; And Prussia , tho ’ to slippery ways Well used , was cursedly near tumbling . Yet still ‘ twas , who could stamp the floor most , Russia and Austria ‘ mong the foremost .— And now , to an Italian air , This precious brace would , hand in hand , go ; Now — while old Louis , from his chair , Intreated them his toes to spare — Called loudly out for a Fandango . And a Fandango , ‘ faith , they had , At which they all set to , like mad ! Never were Kings ( tho ’ small the expense is Of wit among their Excellencies ) So out of all their princely senses , But ah ! that dance — that Spanish dance — Scarce was the luckless strain begun , When , glaring red , as ‘ twere a glance Shot from an angry Southern sun , A light thro ’ all the chambers flamed , Astonishing old Father Frost , Who , bursting into tears , exclaimed , “ A thaw , by Jove — we 're lost , we 're lost ! “ Run , France — a second Waterloo “ Is come to drown you-sauve qui peut ! ” Why , why will monarchs caper so In palaces without foundations ?— Instantly all was in a flow , Crowns , fiddles , sceptres , decorations — Those Royal Arms , that lookt so nice , Cut out in the resplendent ice — Those Eagles , handsomely provided With double heads for double dealings — How fast the globes and sceptres glided Out of their claws on all the ceilings ! Proud Prussia 's double bird of prey Tame as a spatch cock , slunk away ; While — just like France herself , when she Proclaims how great her naval skill is — Poor Louis 's drowning fleurs-de-lys Imagined themselves water-lilies . And not alone rooms , ceilings , shelves , But — still more fatal execution — The Great Legitimates themselves Seemed in a state of dissolution . The indignant Tsar — when just about To issue a sublime Ukase , “ Whereas all light must be kept out ” — Dissolved to nothing in its blaze . Next Prussia took his turn to melt , And , while his lips illustrious felt The influence of this southern air , Some word , like “ Constitution ” — long Congealed in frosty silence there — Came slowly thawing from his tongue . While Louis , lapsing by degrees , And sighing out a faint adieu To truffles , salmis , toasted cheese And smoking fondus , quickly grew , Himself , into a fondu too ;— Or like that goodly King they make Of sugar for a Twelfth-night cake , When , in some urchin 's mouth , alas ! It melts into a shapeless mass ! In short , I scarce could count a minute , Ere the bright dome and all within it , Kings , Fiddlers , Emperors , all were gone — And nothing now was seen or heard But the bright river , rushing on , Happy as an enfranchised bird , And prouder of that natural ray , Shining along its chainless way — More proudly happy thus to glide In simple grandeur to the sea , Than when , in sparkling fetters tied , ‘ Twas deckt with all that kingly pride Could bring to light its slavery ! Such is my dream — and , I confess , I tremble at its awfulness . That Spanish Dance — that southern beam — But I say nothing — there 's my dream — And Madame Krüdener , the she-prophet , May make just what she pleases of it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ It is well-known that the Empress Anne built a palace of ice on the Neva , in 1740 , which was fifty-two feet in length , and when illuminated had a surprising effect . ” — PINKERTON . FABLE II . THE LOOKING-GLASSES . PROEM . Where Kings have been by mob-elections Raised to the throne , ‘ tis strange to see What different and what odd perfections Men have required in Royalty . Some , liking monarchs large and plumpy , Have chosen their Sovereigns by the weight ;— Some wisht them tall , some thought your Dumpy , Dutch-built , the true Legitimate .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Easterns in a Prince , ‘ tis said , Prefer what 's called a jolterhead :[ 2 ] The Egyptians were n't at all partic'lar , So that their Kings had not red hair — This fault not even the greatest stickler For the blood-royal well could bear . A thousand more such illustrations Might be adduced from various nations . But , ‘ mong the many tales they tell us , Touching the acquired or natural right Which some men have to rule their fellows , There 's one which I shall here recite :— FABLE . There was a land — to name the place Is neither now my wish nor duty — Where reigned a certain Royal race , By right of their superior beauty . What was the cut legitimate Of these great persons ’ chins and noses , By right of which they ruled the state , No history I have seen discloses . But so it was — a settled case — Some Act of Parliament , past snugly , Had voted them a beauteous race , And all their faithful subjects ugly . As rank indeed stood high or low , Some change it made in visual organs ; Your Peers were decent — Knights , so so — But all your common people , gorgons ! Of course , if any knave but hinted That the King 's nose was turned awry , Or that the Queen ( God bless her ! ) squinted — The judges doomed that knave to die . But rarely things like this occurred , The people to their King were duteous , And took it , on his Royal word , That they were frights and He was beauteous . The cause whereof , among all classes , Was simply this — these island elves Had never yet seen looking-glasses , And therefore did not know themselves . Sometimes indeed their neighbors ’ faces Might strike them as more full of reason , More fresh than those in certain places — But , Lord , the very thought was treason ! Besides , howe'er we love our neighbor , And take his face 's part , ‘ tis known We ne'er so much in earnest labor , As when the face attackt 's our own . So on they went — the crowd believing — ( As crowds well governed always do ) Their rulers , too , themselves deceiving — So old the joke , they thought ‘ twas true . But jokes , we know , if they too far go , Must have an end — and so , one day , Upon that coast there was a cargo Of looking-glasses cast away . ‘ Twas said , some Radicals , somewhere , Had laid their wicked heads together , And forced that ship to founder there ,— While some believe it was the weather . However this might be , the freight Was landed without fees or duties ; And from that hour historians date The downfall of the Race of Beauties . The looking-glasses got about , And grew so common thro ’ the land , That scarce a tinker could walk out , Without a mirror in his hand . Comparing faces , morning , noon , And night , their constant occupation — By dint of looking-glasses , soon , They grew a most reflecting nation . In vain the Court , aware of errors In all the old , establisht mazards , Prohibited the use of mirrors And tried to break them at all hazards :— In vain — their laws might just as well Have been waste paper on the shelves ; That fatal freight had broke the spell ; People had lookt — and knew themselves . If chance a Duke , of birth sublime , Presumed upon his ancient face , ( Some calf-head , ugly from all time ,) They popt a mirror to his Grace ;— Just hinting , by that gentle sign , How little Nature holds it true , That what is called an ancient line , Must be the line of Beauty too . From Dukes ’ they past to regal phizzes , Compared them proudly with their own , And cried . “ How could such monstrous quizzes “ In Beauty 's name usurp the throne ! ” — They then wrote essays , pamphlets , books , Upon Cosmetical Oeconomy , Which made the King try various looks , But none improved his physiognomy . And satires at the Court were levelled , And small lampoons , so full of slynesses , That soon , in short , they quite bedeviled Their Majesties and Royal Highnesses . At length — but here I drop the veil , To spare some royal folks ’ sensations ;— Besides , what followed is the tale Of all such late-enlightened nations ; Of all to whom old Time discloses A truth they should have sooner known — That kings have neither rights nor noses A whit diviner than their own .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Goths had a law to choose always a short , thick man for their King .— Munster , “ Cosmog . ” lib . iii . p. 164 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>“ In a Prince a jolter-head is invaluable . ” — Oriental Field Sports . FABLE III . THE TORCH OF LIBERTY . I saw it all in Fancy 's glass — Herself , the fair , the wild magician , Who bade this splendid day-dream pass , And named each gliding apparition . ‘ Twas like a torch-race — such as they Of Greece performed , in ages gone , When the fleet youths , in long array , Past the bright torch triumphant on . I saw the expectant nations stand , To catch the coming flame in turn ;— I saw , from ready hand to hand , The clear tho ’ struggling glory burn . And oh ! their joy , as it came near , ‘ Twas in itself a joy to see ;— While Fancy whispered in my ear . “ That torch they pass is Liberty ! ” And each , as she received the flame , Lighted her altar with its ray ; Then , smiling , to the next who came , Speeded it on its sparkling way . From ALBION first , whose ancient shrine Was furnisht with the fire already , COLUMBIA caught the boon divine , And lit a flame , like ALBION 'S , steady . The splendid gift then GALLIA took , And , like a wild Bacchante , raising The brand aloft , its sparkles shook , As she would set the world a-blazing ! Thus kindling wild , so fierce and high Her altar blazed into the air , That ALBION , to that fire too nigh , Shrunk back and shuddered at its glare ! Next , SPAIN , so new was light to her , Leapt at the torch — but , ere the spark That fell upon her shrine could stir , ‘ Twas quenched — and all again was dark . Yet , no — not quenched — a treasure worth So much to mortals rarely dies : Again her living light lookt forth , And shone , a beacon , in all eyes . Who next received the flame ? alas ! Unworthy NAPLES — shame of shames , That ever thro ’ such hands should pass That brightest of all earthly flames ! Scarce had her fingers touched the torch . When , frighted by the sparks it shed , Nor waiting even to feel the scorch , She dropt it to the earth — and fled . And fallen it might have long remained ; But GREECE , who saw her moment now , Caught up the prize , tho ’ prostrate , stained , And waved it round her beauteous brow . And Fancy bade me mark where , o'er Her altar , as its flame ascended , Fair , laurelled spirits seemed to soar , Who thus in song their voices blended :— “ Shine , shine for ever , glorious Flame , “ Divinest gift of Gods to men ! “ From GREECE thy earliest splendor came , “ To GREECE thy ray returns again . “ Take , Freedom , take thy radiant round , “ When dimmed , revive , when lost , return , “ Till not a shrine thro ’ earth be found , “ On which thy glories shall not burn . ” FABLE IV . THE FLY AND THE BULLOCK . PROEM . Of all that , to the sage 's survey , This world presents of topsy-turvy , There 's naught so much disturbs one 's patience , As little minds in lofty stations . ‘ Tis like that sort of painful wonder . Which slender columns , laboring under Enormous arches , give beholders ;— Or those poor Caryatides , Condemned to smile and stand at ease , With a whole house upon their shoulders . If as in some few royal cases , Small minds are born into such places — If they are there by Right Divine Or any such sufficient reason , Why — Heaven forbid we should repine !— To wish it otherwise were treason ; Nay , even to see it in a vision , Would be what lawyers call misprision . SIR ROBERT FILMER saith — and he , Of course , knew all about the matter — “ Both men and beasts love Monarchy ; ” Which proves how rational the latter . SIDNEY , we know , or wrong or right . Entirely differed from the Knight : Nay , hints a King may lose his head . By slipping awkwardly his bridle :— But this is treasonous , ill-bred , And ( now-a-days , when Kings are led In patent snaffles ) downright idle . No , no — it isn  t right-line Kings , ( Those sovereign lords in leading strings Who , from their birth , are Faith-Defenders ,) That move my wrath — ‘ tis your pretenders , Your mushroom rulers , sons of earth , Who — not , like t'others , bores by birth , Establisht gratiâ Dei blockheads , Born with three kingdoms in their pockets — Yet , with a brass that nothing stops , Push up into the loftiest stations , And , tho ’ too dull to manage shops , Presume , the dolts , to manage nations ! This class it is , that moves my gall , And stirs up bile , and spleen and all . While other senseless things appear To know the limits of their sphere — While not a cow on earth romances So much as to conceit she dances — While the most jumping frog we know of , Would scarce at Astley 's hope to show off — Your *** s , your *** s dare , Untrained as are their minds , to set them To any business , any where , At any time that fools will let them . But leave we here these upstart things — My business is just now with Kings ; To whom and to their right-line glory , I dedicate the following story . FABLE The wise men of Egypt were secret as dummies ; And even when they most condescended to teach , They packt up their meaning , as they did their mummies , In so many wrappers , ‘ twas out of one 's reach . They were also , good people , much given to Kings — Fond of craft and of crocodiles , monkeys and mystery ; But blue-bottle flies were their best beloved things — As will partly appear in this very short history . A Scythian philosopher ( nephew , they say , To that other great traveller , young Anacharsis ,) Stept into a temple at Memphis one day , To have a short peep at their mystical farces . He saw a brisk blue-bottle Fly on an altar , Made much of , and worshipt , as something divine ; While a large , handsome Bullock , led there in a halter , Before it lay stabbed at the foot of the shrine . Surprised at such doings , he whispered his teacher — “ If ‘ tis n't impertinent , may I ask why “ Should a Bullock , that useful and powerful creature , “ Be thus offered up to a bluebottle Fly ? ” “ No wonder ” — said t'other — “ you stare at the sight , “ But we as a Symbol of Monarchy view it — “ That Fly on the shrine is Legitimate Right , “ And that Bullock , the People that 's sacrificed to it . ” FABLE V. CHURCH AND STATE . PROEM “ The moment any religion becomes national , or established , its purity must certainly be lost , because it is then impossible to keep it unconnected with men 's interests ; and , if connected , it must inevitably be perverted by them . ” — SOAME JENYNS Thus did SOAME JENYNS — tho ’ a Tory , A Lord of Trade and the Plantations ; Feel how Religion 's simple glory Is stained by State associations . When CATHARINE , ere she crusht the Poles , Appealed to the benign Divinity ; Then cut them up in protocols , Made fractions of their very souls — All in the name of the blest Trinity ; Or when her grandson , ALEXANDER , That mighty Northern salamander ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Whose icy touch , felt all about , Puts every fire of Freedom out — When he , too , winds up his Ukases With God and the Panagia 's praises — When he , of royal Saints the type , In holy water dips the sponge , With which , at one imperial wipe , He would all human rights expunge ; When LOUIS ( whom as King , and eater , Some name Dix-huit , and some Deshuitres . ) Calls down “ St. Louis 's God ” to witness The right , humanity , and fitness Of sending eighty thousand Solons , Sages with muskets and laced coats , To cram instruction , nolens volens , Down the poor struggling Spaniards ’ throats — I can  t help thinking , ( tho ’ to Kings I must , of course , like other men , bow ,) That when a Christian monarch brings Religion 's name to gloss these things — Such blasphemy out-Benbows Benbow !<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Or — not so far for facts to roam , Having a few much nearer home - When we see Churchmen , who , if askt , “ Must Ireland 's slaves be tithed , and taskt , “ And driven , like Negroes or Croats , “ That you may roll in wealth and bliss ? ” Look from beneath their shovel hats With all due pomp and answer “ Yes ! ” But then , if questioned , “ Shall the brand “ Intolerance flings throughout that land ,— “ Shall the fierce strife now taught to grow ‘ Betwixt her palaces and hovels , “ Be ever quenched ? ” — from the same shovels Look grandly forth and answer “ No . ” — Alas , alas ! have these a claim To merciful Religion 's name ? If more you seek , go see a bevy Of bowing parsons at a levee — ( Choosing your time , when straw 's before Some apoplectic bishop 's door ,) Then if thou canst with life escape That rush of lawn , that press of crape , Just watch their reverences and graces , As on each smirking suitor frisks , And say , if those round shining faces To heaven or earth most turn their disks ? This , this it is — Religion , made , Twixt Church and State , a truck , a trade — This most ill-matched , unholy Co ., From whence the ills we witness flow ; The war of many creeds with one — The extremes of too much faith and none — Till , betwixt ancient trash and new , ‘ Twixt Cant and Blasphemy — the two Rank ills with which this age is curst — We can no more tell which is worst , Than erst could Egypt , when so rich In various plagues , determine which She thought most pestilent and vile , Her frogs , like Benbow and Carlisle , Croaking their native mud-notes loud , Or her fat locusts , like a cloud Of pluralists , obesely lowering , At once benighting and devouring !— This — this it is — and here I pray Those sapient wits of the Reviews . Who make us poor , dull authors say , Not what we mean , but what they choose ; Who to our most abundant shares Of nonsense add still more of theirs , And are to poets just such evils As caterpillars find those flies ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Which , not content to sting like devils , Lay eggs upon their backs like wise — To guard against such foul deposits Of other 's meaning in my rhymes , ( A thing more needful here because it 's A subject , ticklish in these times ) — I , here , to all such wits make known , Monthly and Weekly , Whig and Tory , ‘ Tis this Religion — this alone — I aim at in the following story :— FABLE . When Royalty was young and bold , Ere , touched by Time , he had become — If ‘ tis n't civil to say old , At least , a ci-devant jeune homme ; One evening , on some wild pursuit Driving along , he chanced to see Religion , passing by on foot , And took him in his vis-à-vis . This said Religion was a Friar , The humblest and the best of men , Who ne'er had notion or desire Of riding in a coach till then . “ I say ” — quoth Royalty , who rather Enjoyed a masquerading joke — “ I say , suppose , my good old father , “ You lend me for a while your cloak . ” The Friar consented — little knew What tricks the youth had in his head ; Besides , was rather tempted too By a laced coat he got instead . Away ran Royalty , slap-dash , Scampering like mad about the town ; Broke windows , shivered lamps to smash , And knockt whole scores of watchmen down . While naught could they , whose heads were broke , Learn of the “ why ” or the “ wherefore , ” Except that ‘ twas Religion 's cloak The gentleman , who crackt them , wore , Meanwhile , the Friar , whose head was turned By the laced coat , grew frisky too ; Lookt big — his former habits spurned — And stormed about , as great men do : Dealt much in pompous oaths and curses — Said “ Damn you ” often , or as bad — Laid claim to other people 's purses — In short , grew either knaves or mad . As work like this was unbefitting , And flesh and blood no longer bore it , The Court of Common Sense , then sitting , Summoned the culprits both before it . Where , after hours in wrangling spent ( As Courts must wrangle to decide well ) . Religion to St. Luke 's was sent , And Royalty packt off to Bridewell . With this proviso — should they be Restored , in due time , to their senses , They both must give security , In future , against such offences — Religion ne'er to lend his cloak , Seeing what dreadful work it leads to ; And Royalty to crack his joke ,— But not to crack poor people 's heads too .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The salamander is supposed to have the power of extinguishing fire by its natural coldness and moisture .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>A well-known publisher of irreligious books .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>“ The greatest number of the ichneumon tribe are seen settling upon the back of the caterpillar , and darting at different intervals their stings into its body — at every dart they deposit an egg ” — GOLDSMITH .

Novella , a young Bolognese , The daughter of a learned Law Doctor ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Who had with all the subtleties Of old and modern jurists stockt her , Was so exceeding fair , ‘ tis said , And over hearts held such dominion , That when her father , sick in bed , Or busy , sent her , in his stead , To lecture on the Code Justinian , She had a curtain drawn before her , Lest , if her charms were seen , the students Should let their young eyes wander o'er her , And quite forget their jurisprudence . Just so it is with Truth , when seen , Too dazzling far ,— ‘ tis from behind A light , thin allegoric screen , She thus can safest leach mankind . FABLE . In Thibet once there reigned , we 're told , A little Lama , one year old — Raised to the throne , that realm to bless , Just when his little Holiness Had cut — as near as can be reckoned — Some say his first tooth , some his second . Chronologers and Nurses vary , Which proves historians should be wary . We only know the important truth , His Majesty had cut a tooth . And much his subjects were enchanted ,— As well all Lamas ’ subjects may be , And would have given their heads , if wanted , To make tee-totums for the baby . Throned as he was by Right Divine — ( What Lawyers call Jure Divino , Meaning a right to yours and mine And everybody 's goods and rhino . ) Of course , his faithful subjects ’ purses Were ready with their aids and succors ; Nothing was seen but pensioned Nurses ; And the land groaned with bibs and tuckers . Oh ! had there been a Hume or Bennet , Then sitting in the Thibet Senate , Ye Gods ! what room for long debates Upon the Nursery Estimates ! What cutting down of swaddling-clothes And pinafores , in nightly battles ! What calls for papers to expose The waste of sugar-plums and rattles ! But no — if Thibet had M. P. s , They were far better bred than these ; Nor gave the slightest opposition , During the Monarch 's whole dentition . But short this calm ;— for , just when he , Had reached the alarming age of three , When Royal natures and no doubt Those of all noble beasts break out — The Lama , who till then was quiet , Showed symptoms of a taste for riot ; And , ripe for mischief , early , late , Without regard for Church or State , Made free with whosoe'er came nigh ; Tweakt the Lord Chancellor by the nose , Turned all the Judges ’ wigs awry , And trod on the old Generals ’ toes ; Pelted the Bishops with hot buns , Rode cock-horse on the City maces , And shot from little devilish guns , Hard peas into the subjects ’ faces . In short , such wicked pranks he played , And ’ grew so mischievous , God bless him ! That his Chief Nurse — with even the aid Of an Archbishop — was afraid . When in these moods , to comb or dress him . Nay , even the persons most inclined Thro ’ thick and thin , for Kings to stickle , Thought him ( if they 'd but speak their mind ; Which they did not ) an odious pickle . At length some patriot lords — a breed Of animals they 've got in Thibet , Extremely rare and fit indeed For folks like Pidcock , to exhibit — Some patriot lords , who saw the length To which things went , combined their strength , And penned a manly , plain and free , Remonstrance to the Nursery ; Protesting warmly that they yielded To none that ever went before ‘ em , In loyalty to him who wielded The hereditary pap-spoon o'er ‘ em ; That , as for treason , ‘ twas a thing That made them almost sick to think of — That they and theirs stood by the King , Throughout his measles and his chincough , When others , thinking him consumptive , Had ratted to the Heir Presumptive !— But , still — tho ’ much admiring Kings ( And chiefly those in leading-strings ) , They saw , with shame and grief of soul , There was no longer now the wise And constitutional control Of birch before their ruler 's eyes ; But that of late such pranks and tricks And freaks occurred the whole day long , As all but men with bishoprics Allowed , in even a King , were wrong . Wherefore it was they humbly prayed That Honorable Nursery , That such reforms be henceforth made , As all good men desired to see ;— In other words ( lest they might seem Too tedious ) , as the gentlest scheme For putting all such pranks to rest , And in its bud the mischief nipping — They ventured humbly to suggest His Majesty should have a whipping ! When this was read , no Congreve rocket , Discharged into the Gallic trenches E'er equalled the tremendous shock it Produced upon the Nursery benches . The Bishops , who of course had votes , By right of age and petticoats , Were first and foremost in the fuss — “ What , whip a Lama ! suffer birch “ To touch his sacred — infamous ! “ Deistical !— assailing thus “ The fundamentals of the Church !— “ No — no — such patriot plans as these , “ ( So help them Heaven — and their Sees ! ) “ They held to be rank blasphemies . ” The alarm thus given , by these and other Grave ladies of the Nursery side , Spread thro ’ the land , till , such a pother , Such party squabbles , far and wide , Never in history 's page had been Recorded , as were then between The Whippers and Non-whippers seen . Till , things arriving at a state , Which gave some fears of revolution , The patriot lords ’ advice , tho ’ late , Was put at last in execution . The Parliament of Thibet met — The little Lama , called before it , Did , then and there , his whipping get , And ( as the Nursery Gazette Assures us ) like a hero bore it . And tho ’ , ‘ mong Thibet Tories , some Lament that Royal Martyrdom ( Please to observe , the letter D In this last word 's pronounced like B ) , Yet to the example of that Prince So much is Thibet 's land a debtor , That her long line of Lamas , since , Have all behaved themselves much better .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Andreas . FABLE VII . THE EXTINGUISHERS . PROEM . Tho ’ soldiers are the true supports , The natural allies of Courts , Woe to the Monarch , who depends Too much on his red-coated friends ; For even soldiers sometimes think — Nay , Colonels have been known to reason ,— And reasoners , whether clad in pink Or red or blue , are on the brink ( Nine cases out of ten ) of treason Not many soldiers , I believe , are As fond of liberty as Mina ; Else — woe to Kings ! when Freedom 's fever Once turns into a Scarletina ! For then — but hold — ‘ tis best to veil My meaning in the following tale :— FABLE . A Lord of Persia , rich and great , Just come into a large estate , Was shockt to find he had , for neighbors , Close to his gate , some rascal Ghebers , Whose fires , beneath his very nose , In heretic combustion rose . But Lords of Persia can , no doubt , Do what they will — so , one fine morning , He turned the rascal Ghebers out , First giving a few kicks for warning . Then , thanking Heaven most piously , He knockt their Temple to the ground , Blessing himself for joy to see Such Pagan ruins strewed around . But much it vext my Lord to find , That , while all else obeyed his will , The Fire these Ghebers left behind , Do what he would , kept burning still . Fiercely he stormed , as if his frown Could scare the bright insurgent down ; But , no — such fires are headstrong things , And care not much for Lords or Kings . Scarce could his Lordship well contrive The flashes in one place to smother , Before — hey presto !— all alive , They sprung up freshly in another . At length when , spite of prayers and damns , ‘ Twas found the sturdy flame defied him , His stewards came , with low salams , Offering , by contract , to provide him Some large Extinguishers , ( a plan , Much used , they said , at Ispahan , Vienna , Petersburg — in short , Wherever Light 's forbid at court ) , Machines no Lord should be without , Which would at once put promptly out All kinds of fires ,— from staring , stark Volcanoes to the tiniest spark ; Till all things slept as dull and dark , As in a great Lord 's neighborhood ‘ Twas right and fitting all things should . Accordingly , some large supplies Of these Extinguishers were furnisht ( All of the true Imperial size ) , And there , in rows , stood black and burnisht , Ready , where'er a gleam but shone Of light or fire , to be clapt on . But ah ! how lordly wisdom errs , In trusting to extinguishers ! One day , when he had left all sure , ( At least , so thought he ) dark , secure — The flame , at all its exits , entries , Obstructed to his heart 's content , And black extinguishers , like sentries , Placed over every dangerous vent — Ye Gods , imagine his amaze , His wrath , his rage , when , on returning , He found not only the old blaze , Brisk as before , crackling and burning ,— Not only new , young conflagrations , Popping up round in various stations — But still more awful , strange and dire , The Extinguishers themselves on fire !!<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>They , they — those trusty , blind machines His Lordship had so long been praising , As , under Providence , the means Of keeping down all lawless blazing , Were now , themselves — alas , too true , The shameful fact — turned blazers too , And by a change as odd as cruel Instead of dampers , served for fuel ! Thus , of his only hope bereft , “ What , ” said the great man , “ must be done ? ” — All that , in scrapes like this , is left To great men is — to cut and run . So run he did ; while to their grounds , The banisht Ghebers blest returned ; And , tho ’ their Fire had broke its bounds , And all abroad now wildly burned , Yet well could they , who loved the flame , Its wandering , its excess reclaim ; And soon another , fairer Dome Arose to be its sacred home , Where , cherisht , guarded , not confined , The living glory dwelt inshrined , And , shedding lustre strong , but even , Tho ’ born of earth , grew worthy heaven .

Lord Chateaubriand made a speech , ( Quoting , to show what men 's rights are , Or rather what men 's rights should be , From Hobbes , Lord Castlereagh , the Tsar , And other friends to Liberty ,) Wherein he — having first protested ‘ Gainst humoring the mob — suggested ( As the most high-bred plan he saw For giving the new War éclat ) A grand , Baptismal Melo-drame , To be got up at Notre Dame , In which the Duke ( who , bless his Highness ! Had by his hilt acquired such fame , ‘ Twas hoped that he as little shyness Would show , when to the point he came ,) Should , for his deeds so lion-hearted , Be christened Hero , ere he started ; With power , by Royal Ordonnance , To bear that name — at least in France .

Or if ( the Viscount said ) this scheme Too rash and premature should seem — If thus discounting heroes , on tick — This glory , by anticipation , Was too much in the genre romantique For such a highly classic nation , He begged to say , the Abyssinians A practice had in their dominions , Which , if at Paris got up well . In full costume , was sure to tell .

THE FUDGE FAMILY IN PARIS . Le Leggi della Maschera richiedono che una persona mascherata non sia salutata per nome da uno che la conosce malgrado il suo travestimento . CASTIGLIONE . PREFACE . In what manner the following Epistles came into my hands , it is not necessary for the public to know . It will be seen by Mr. FUDGE 'S Second Letter , that he is one of those gentlemen whose Secret Services in Ireland , under the mild ministry of my Lord CASTLEREAGH , have been so amply and gratefully remunerated . Like his friend and associate , THOMAS REYNOLDS , Esq ., he had retired upon the reward of his honest industry ; but has lately been induced to appear again in active life , and superintend the training of that Delatorian Cohort which Lord SIDMOUTH , in his wisdom and benevolence , has organized . Whether Mr. FUDGE , himself , has yet made any discoveries , does not appear from the following pages . But much may be expected from a person of his zeal and sagacity , and , indeed , to him , Lord SIDMOUTH , and the Greenland-bound ships , the eyes of all lovers of discoveries are now most anxiously directed . I regret much that I have been obliged to omit Mr. BOB FUDGE 'S Third Letter , concluding the adventures of his Day with the Dinner , Opera , etc . ; — but , in consequence of some remarks upon Marinette 's thin drapery , which , it was thought , might give offence to certain well-meaning persons , the manuscript was sent back to Paris for his revision and had not returned when the last sheet was put to press . It will not , I hope , be thought presumptuous , if I take this opportunity of complaining of a very serious injustice I have suffered from the public . Dr. KING wrote a treatise to prove that BENTLEY “ was not the author of his own book , ” and a similar absurdity has been asserted of me , in almost all the best-informed literary circles . With the name of the real author staring them in the face , they have yet persisted in attributing my works to other people ; and the fame of the “ Twopenny Post - Bag ” — such as it is — having hovered doubtfully over various persons , has at last settled upon the head of a certain little gentleman , who wears it , I understand , as complacently as if it actually belonged to him . I can only add , that if any lady or gentleman , curious in such matters , will take the trouble of calling at my lodgings , 245 Piccadilly , I shall have the honor of assuring them , in propriâ personâ , that I am — his , or her , Very obedient and very humble Servant , April 17 , 1818 . THOMAS BROWN THE YOUNGER . THE FUDGE FAMILY IN PARIS LETTER I . FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ——, OF CLONKILTY , IN IRELAND . Amiens . Dear DOLL , while the tails of our horses are plaiting , The trunks tying on , and Papa , at the door , Into very bad French is as usual translating His English resolve not to give a sou more , I sit down to write you a line — only think !— A letter from France , with French pens and French ink , How delightful ! tho ’ , would you believe it , my dear ? I have seen nothing yet very wonderful here ; No adventure , no sentiment , far as we 've come , But the cornfields and trees quite as dull as at home ; And but for the post-boy , his boots and his queue , I might just as well be at Clonkilty with you ! In vain , at DESSEIN 'S , did I take from my trunk That divine fellow , STERNE , and fall reading “ The Monk ; ” In vain did I think of his charming Dead Ass , And remember the crust and the wallet — alas ! No monks can be had now for love or for money , ( All owing , Pa says , to that infidel BONEY ;) And , tho ’ one little Neddy we saw in our drive Out of classical Nampont , the beast was alive ! By the by , tho ’ at Calais , Papa had a touch Of romance on the pier , which affected me much . At the sight of that spot , where our darling DIXHUIT Set the first of his own dear legitimate feet ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>( Modelled out so exactly , and — God bless the mark ! ‘ Tis a foot , DOLLY , worthy so Grand a Monarque ) . He exclaimed , “ Oh , mon Roi ! ” and , with tear-dropping eye , Stood to gaze on the spot — while some Jacobin , nigh , Muttered out with a shrug ( what an insolent thing ! ) “ Ma foi , he be right — ‘ tis de Englishman 's King ; And dat gros pied de cochon — begar me vil say Dat de foot look mosh better , if turned toder way . ” There 's the pillar , too — Lord ! I had nearly forgot — What a charming idea !— raised close to the spot ; The mode being now , ( as you 've heard , I suppose ,) To build tombs over legs and raise pillars to toes . This is all that 's occurred sentimental as yet ; Except indeed some little flower-nymphs we 've met , Who disturb one 's romance with pecuniary views , Flinging flowers in your path , and then — bawling for sous ! And some picturesque beggars , whose multitudes seem To recall the good days of the ancien regime , All as ragged and brisk , you 'll be happy to learn , And as thin as they were in the time of poor STERNE . Our party consists ( in a neat Calais job ) Of Papa and myself , Mr. CONNOR and BOB . You remember how sheepish BOB lookt at Kilrandy , But , Lord ! he 's quite altered — they 've made him a Dandy ; A thing , you know , whiskered , great-coated , and laced , Like an hour-glass , exceedingly small in the waist ; Quite a new sort of creatures , unknown yet to scholars , With beads so immovably stuck in shirt-collars , That seats , like our music-stools , soon must be found them , To twirl , when the creatures may wish , to look round them , In short , dear , “ a Dandy ” describes what I mean , And BOB 's far the best of the genus I 've seen : An improving young man , fond of learning , ambitious , And goes now to Paris to study French dishes . Whose names — think , how quick ! he already knows pat , À la braise , petits pâtés , and — what d ’ ye call that They inflict on potatoes ?— oh ! maître d'hôtel — I assure you , dear DOLLY , he knows them as well As if nothing else all his life he had eat , Tho ’ a bit of them BOBBY has never touched yet ; But just knows the names of French dishes and cooks , As dear Pa knows the titles of authors and books . As to Pa , what d ’ ye think ?— mind , it 's all entre nous , But you know , love , I never keep secrets from you — Why , he 's writing a book — what ! a tale ? a romance ? No , we Gods , would it were !— but his travels in France ; At the special desire ( he let out t'other day ) Of his great friend and patron , my Lord CASTLEREAGH , Who said , “ My dear FUDGE ” — I forget the exact words , And , it 's strange , no one ever remembers my Lord 's ; But ‘ twas something to say that , as all must allow A good orthodox work is much wanting just now , To expound to the world the new — thingummie — science , Found out by the — what'shYpppHeNitshYpppHeNname — Holy Alliance , And prove to mankind that their rights are but folly , Their freedom a joke ( which it is , you know , DOLLY ) , “ There 's none , ” said his Lordship , “ if I may be judge , Half so fit for this great undertaking as FUDGE ! ” The matter 's soon , settled — Pa flies to the Row ( The first stage your tourists now usually go ) , Settles all for his quarto — advertisements , praises — Starts post from the door , with his tablets — French phrases — “ SCOTT 'S Visit ” of course — in short , everything he has An author can want , except words and ideas :— And , lo ! the first thing , in the spring of the year , Is PHIL . FUDGE at the front of a Quarto , my dear ! But , bless me , my paper 's near out , so I 'd better Draw fast to a close :— this exceeding long letter You owe to a déjeûner à la fourchette , Which BOBBY would have , and is hard at it yet .— What 's next ? oh ? the tutor , the last of the party , Young CONNOR :— they say he 's so like BONAPARTE , His nose and his chin — which Papa rather dreads , As the Bourbons , you know , are suppressing all heads That resemble old NAP 'S , and who knows but their honors May think , in their fright , of suppressing poor CONNOR 'S ? Au reste ( as we say ) , the young lad 's well enough , Only talks much of Athens , Rome , virtue and stuff ; A third cousin of ours , by the way — poor as Job ( Tho ’ of royal descent by the side of Mamma ) , And for charity made private tutor to BOB ; Entre nous , too , a Papist — how liberal of Pa ! This is all , dear ,— forgive me for breaking off thus , But BOB 'S déjeûner 's done , and Papa 's in a fuss . B. F. P. S. How provoking of Pa ! he will not let me stop Just to run in and rummage some milliner 's shop ; And my début in Paris , I blush to think on it , Must now , DOLL , be made in a hideous low bonnet . But Paris , dear Paris !— oh , there will be joy , And romance , and high bonnets , and Madame Le Roi !<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>To commemorate the landing of Louis le Désiré from England , the impression of his foot is marked out on the pier at Calais , and a pillar with an inscription raised opposite to the spot .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>A celebrated mantua-maker in Paris . LETTER II . FROM PHIL . FUDGE , ESQ ., TO THE LORD VISCOUNT CASTLEREAGH . Paris . At length , my Lord , I have the bliss To date to you a line from this “ Demoralized ” metropolis ; Where , by plebeians low and scurvy , The throne was turned quite topsy-turvy , And Kingship , tumbled from its seat , “ Stood prostrate ” at the people 's feet ; Where ( still to use your Lordship 's tropes ) The level of obedience slopes Upward and downward , as the stream Of hydra faction kicks the beam !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Where the poor Palace changes masters Quicker than a snake its skin , And LOUIS is rolled out on castors , While BONEY 'S borne on shoulders in :— But where , in every change , no doubt , One special good your Lordship traces ,— That ‘ tis the Kings alone turn out , The Ministers still keep their places . How oft , dear Viscount CASTLEREAGH , I 've thought of thee upon the way , As in my job ( what place could be More apt to wake a thought of thee ? ) — Or , oftener far , when gravely sitting Upon my dicky , ( as is fitting For him who writes a Tour , that he May more of men and manners see . ) I 've thought of thee and of thy glories , Thou guest of Kings and King of Tories ! Reflecting how thy fame has grown And spread , beyond man 's usual share , At home , abroad , till thou art known , Like Major SEMPLE , everywhere ! And marvelling with what powers of breath Your Lordship , having speeched to death Some hundreds of your fellow-men , Next speeched to Sovereign 's ears ,— and when All Sovereigns else were dozed , at last Speeched down the Sovereign of Belfast . Oh ! mid the praises and the trophies Thou gain'st from Morosophs and Sophis ; Mid all the tributes to thy fame , There 's one thou shouldst be chiefly pleased at — That Ireland gives her snuff thy name , And CASTLEREAGH 'S the thing now sneezed at ! But hold , my pen !— a truce to praising — Tho ’ even your Lordship will allow The theme 's temptations are amazing ; But time and ink run short , and now , ( As thou wouldst say , my guide and teacher In these gay metaphorie fringes , I must embark into the feature On which this letter chiefly hinges ;) My Book , the Book that is to prove — And will , ( so help ye Sprites above , That sit on clouds , as grave as judges , Watching the labors of the FUDGES ! ) Will prove that all the world , at present , Is in a state extremely pleasant ; That Europe — thanks to royal swords And bayonets , and the Duke commanding — Enjoys a peace which , like the Lord 's , Passeth all human understanding : That France prefers her go-cart King To such a coward scamp as BONEY ; Tho ’ round , with each a leading-string . There standeth many a Royal crony , For fear the chubby , tottering thing Should fall , if left there loney-poney ;— That England , too , the more her debts , The more she spends , the richer gets ; And that the Irish , grateful nation !

FROM MR. BOB FUDGE TO RICHARD ——, ESQ . Oh Dick ! you may talk of your writing and reading , Your Logic and Greek , but there 's nothing like feeding ; And this is the place for it , DICKY , you dog , Of all places on earth — the headquarters of Prog ! Talk of England — her famed Magna Charta , I swear , is A humbug , a flam , to the Carte<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>at old VÉRY 'S ; And as for your Juries — who would not set o'er ‘ em A Jury of Tasters , with woodcocks before ‘ em ? Give CARTWRIGHT his Parliaments , fresh every year ; But those friends of short Commons would never do here ; And , let ROMILLY speak as he will on the question . No Digest of Law 's like the laws of digestion ! By the by , DICK , I fatten — but n'importe for that , ‘ Tis the mode — your Legitimates always get fat . There 's the REGENT , there 's LOUIS — and BONEY tried too , But , tho ’ somewhat imperial in paunch , ‘ twould n't do :— He improved indeed much in this point when he wed , But he ne'er grew right royally fat in the head . DICK , DICK , what a place is this Paris !— but stay — As my raptures may bore you , I 'll just sketch a Day , As we pass it , myself and some comrades I 've got , All thorough-bred Gnostics , who know what is what . After dreaming some hours of the land of Cocaigne , That Elysium of all that is friand and nice , Where for hail they have bon-bons , and claret for rain , And the skaters in winter show off on cream-ice ; Where so ready all nature its cookery yields , Macaroni au parmesan grows in the fields ; Little birds fly about with the true pheasant taint , And the geese are all born with a liver complaint ! I rise — put on neck-cloth — stiff , tight , as can be — For a lad who goes into the world , DICK , like me , Should have his neck tied up , you know — there 's no doubt of it — Almost as tight as some lads who go out of it . With whiskers well oiled , and with boots that “ hold up “ The mirror to nature ” — so bright you could sup Off the leather like china ; with coat , too , that draws On the tailor , who suffers , a martyr 's applause !— With head bridled up , like a four-in-hand leader , And stays — devil 's in them — too tight for a feeder , I strut to the old Café Hardy , which yet Beats the field at a déjeûner a la fourchette . There , DICK , what a breakfast !— oh ! not like your ghost Of a breakfast in England , your curst tea and toast ; But a side-board , you dog , where one 's eye roves about , Like a turk 's in the Haram , and thence singles out One 's pâté of larks , just to tune up the throat , One 's small limbs of chickens , done en papillote . One 's erudite cutlets , drest all ways but plain , Or one 's kidneys — imagine , DICK — done with champagne ! Then , some glasses of Beaune , to dilute — or , mayhap , Chambertin ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>which you know 's the pet tipple of NAP , And which Dad , by the by , that legitimate stickler , Much scruples to taste , but I 'm not so partic'lar .— Your coffee comes next , by prescription : and then DICK 's The coffee 's ne'erhYpppHeNfailing and glorious appendix , ( If books had but such , my old Grecian , depend o n't , I 'd swallow e'en Watkins ’ , for sake of the end o n't ,) A neat glass of parfait-amour , which one sips Just as if bottled velvet tipt over one 's lips . This repast being ended , and paid for — ( how odd ! Till a man 's used to paying , there 's something so queer i n't ! ) — The sun now well out , and the girls all abroad , And the world enough aired for us Nobs to appear i n't , We lounge up the boulevards , where — oh ! DICK , the phizzes , The turn-outs , we meet — what a nation of quizzes ! Here toddles along some old figure of fun , With a coat you might date Anno Domini 1 .; A laced hat , worsted stockings , and — noble old soul ! A fine ribbon and cross in his best button-hole ; Just such as our PRINCE , who nor reason nor fun dreads , Inflicts , without even a court-martial , on hundreds . Here trips a grisette , with a fond , roguish eye , ( Rather eatable things these grisettes , by the by ) ; And there an old demoiselle , almost as fond , In a silk that has stood since the time of the Fronde . There goes a French Dandy — ah , DICK ! unlike some ones We 've seen about WHITE 'S — the Mounseers are but rum ones ; Such hats !— fit for monkies — I 'd back Mrs. DRAPER To cut neater weather-boards out of brown paper : And coats — how I wish , if it would n't distress ‘ em , They 'd club for old BRUMMEL , from Calais , to dress ‘ em ! The collar sticks out from the neck such a space , That you 'd swear ‘ twas the plan of this head-lopping nation , To leave there behind them a snug little place For the head to drop into , on decapitation . In short , what with mountebanks , counts and friseurs , Some mummers by trade and the rest amateurs — What with captains in new jockey-boots and silk breeches , Old dustmen with swinging great opera-hats , And shoeblacks , reclining by statues in niches , There never was seen such a race of Jack Sprats ! From the Boulevards — but hearken !— yes — as I 'm a sinner , The clock is just striking the half-hour to dinner : So no more at present — short time for adorning — My Day must be finisht some other fine morning . Now , hey for old BEAUVILLIERS 'S<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>larder , my boy !

Still hope and suffer , all who can !— but I , Who durst not hope , and cannot bear , must fly . But whither ?— every where the scourge pursues — Turn where he will , the wretched wanderer views , In the bright , broken hopes of all his race , Countless reflections of the Oppressor 's face . Every where gallant hearts and spirits true , Are served up victims to the vile and few ; While England , every where — the general foe Of Truth and Freedom , wheresoe'er they glow — Is first , when tyrants strike , to aid the blow . Oh , England ! could such poor revenge atone For wrongs , that well might claim the deadliest one ; Were it a vengeance , sweet enough to sate The wretch who flies from thy intolerant hate , To hear his curses on such barbarous sway Echoed , where'er he bends his cheerless way ;— Could this content him , every lip he meets Teems for his vengeance with such poisonous sweets ; Were this his luxury , never is thy name Pronounced , but he doth banquet on thy shame ; Hears maledictions ring from every side Upon that grasping power , that selfish pride , Which vaunts its own and scorns all rights beside ; That low and desperate envy which to blast A neighbor 's blessings risks the few thou hast ;— That monster , Self , too gross to be concealed , Which ever lurks behind thy proffered shield ;— That faithless craft , which , in thy hour of need , Can court the slave , can swear he shall be freed , Yet basely spurns him , when thy point is gained , Back to his masters , ready gagged and chained ! Worthy associate of that band of Kings , That royal , ravening flock , whose vampire wings O'er sleeping Europe treacherously brood , And fan her into dreams of promist good , Of hope , of freedom — but to drain her blood ! If thus to hear thee branded be a bliss That Vengeance loves , there 's yet more sweet than this , That ‘ twas an Irish head , an Irish heart , Made thee the fallen and tarnisht thing thou art ; That , as the centaur gave the infected vest In which he died , to rack his conqueror 's breast , We sent thee CASTLEREAGH :— as heaps of dead Have slain their slayers by the pest they spread , So hath our land breathed out , thy fame to dim , Thy strength to waste and rot thee soul and limb , Her worst infections all condensed in him ! When will the world shake off such yokes ? oh , when Will that redeeming day shine out on men , That shall behold them rise , erect and free As Heaven and Nature meant mankind should be ! When Reason shall no longer blindly bow To the vile pagod things , that o'er her brow , Like him of Jaghernaut , drive trampling now ; Nor Conquest dare to desolate God 's earth ; Nor drunken Victory , with a NERO 'S mirth , Strike her lewd harp amidst a people 's groans ;— But , built on love , the world 's exalted thrones Shall to the virtuous and the wise be given — Those bright , those sole Legitimates of Heaven ! When will this be ?— or , oh ! is it , in truth , But one of those sweet , day-break dreams of youth , In which the Soul , as round her morning springs , ‘ Twixt sleep and waking , see such dazzling things ! And must the hope , as vain as it is bright , Be all resigned ?— and are they only right , Who say this world of thinking souls was made To be by Kings partitioned , truckt and weighed In scales that , ever since the world begun , Have counted millions but as dust to one ? Are they the only wise , who laugh to scorn The rights , the freedom to which man was born ? Who . . . . . . . . . . Who , proud to kiss each separate rod of power , Bless , while he reigns , the minion of the hour ; Worship each would-be god , that o'er them moves , And take the thundering of his brass for JOVE 'S ! If this be wisdom , then farewell , my books , Farewell , ye shrines of old , ye classic brooks . Which fed my soul with currents , pure and fair , Of living Truth that now must stagnate there !— Instead of themes that touch the lyre with light , Instead of Greece and her immortal fight For Liberty which once awaked my strings , Welcome the Grand Conspiracy of Kings , The High Legitimates , the Holy Band , Who , bolder ’ even than He of Sparta 's land , Against whole millions , panting to be free , Would guard the pass of right line tyranny . Instead of him , the Athenian bard whose blade Had stood the onset which his pen portrayed , Welcome . . . . . . . . .

LETTER V. FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ——. What a time since I wrote !— I 'm a sad , naughty girl — For , tho ’ like a tee-totum , I 'm all in a twirl ;— Yet even ( as you wittily say ) a tee-totum Between all its twirls gives a letter to note ‘ em . But , Lord , such a place ! and then , DOLLY , my dresses , My gowns , so divine !— there 's no language expresses , Except just the two words “ superbe , magnifique , ” The trimmings of that which I had home last week ! It is called — I forget — à la — something which sounded Like alicampane — but in truth I 'm confounded And bothered , my dear , ‘ twixt that troublesome boy 's ( BOB 'S ) cookery language , and Madame LE ROI 'S : What with fillets of roses , and fillets of veal , Things garni with lace , and things garni with eel , One 's hair and one 's cutlets both en papillote , And a thousand more things I shall ne'er have by rote , I can scarce tell the difference , at least as to phrase , Between beef à la Psyche and curls à la braise .— But in short , dear , I 'm trickt out quite à la Francaise , With my bonnet — so beautiful !— high up and poking , Like things that are put to keep chimneys from smoking . Where shall I begin with the endless delights Of this Eden of milliners , monkeys and sights — This dear busy place , where there 's nothing transacting But dressing and dinnering , dancing and acting ? Imprimis , the Opera — mercy , my ears ! Brother BOBBY 'S remark , t'other night , was a true one :— “ This must be the music , ” said he , “ of the spears , For I 'm curst if each note of it doesn  t run thro ’ one ! ” Pa says ( and you know , love , his Book 's to make out ‘ Twas the Jacobins brought every mischief about ) That this passion for roaring has come in of late , Since the rabble all tried for a voice in the State .— What a frightful idea , one 's mind to o'erwhelm ! What a chorus , dear DOLLY , would soon be let loose of it , If , when of age , every man in the realm Had a voice like old LAIS ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and chose to make use of it ! No — never was known in this riotous sphere Such a breach of the peace as their singing , my dear . So bad too , you 'd swear that the God of both arts , Of Music and Physic , had taken a frolic For setting a loud fit of asthma in parts , And composing a fine rumbling bass to a cholic ! But , the dancing — ah parlez-moi , DOLLY , de ca — There , indeed , is a treat that charms all but Papa . Such beauty — such grace — oh ye sylphs of romance ! Fly , fly to TITANIA , and ask her if she has One light-footed nymph in her train , that can dance Like divine BIGOTTINI and sweet FANNY BIAS ! FANNY BIAS in FLORA — dear creature !— you 'd swear , When her delicate feet in the dance twinkle round , That her steps are of light , that her home is the air , And she only par complaisance touches the ground . And when BIGOTTINI in PSYCHE dishevels Her black flowing hair , and by daemons is driven , Oh ! who does not envy those rude little devils , That hold her and hug her , and keep her from heaven ? Then , the music — so softly its cadences die , So divinely — oh , DOLLY ! between you and I , It 's as well for my peace that there 's nobody nigh To make love to me then — you 've a soul , and can judge What a crisis ‘ twould be for your friend BIDDY FUDGE !

Here DANIEL , in pantomime ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>bids bold defiance To NEBUCHADNEZZAR and all his stuft lions , While pretty young Israelites dance round the Prophet , In very thin clothing , and but little of it ;— Here BEGRAND ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>who shines in this scriptural path , As the lovely SUSANNA , without even a relic Of drapery round her , comes out of the bath In a manner that , BOB says , is quite Eve-angelic !

These vehicles , mind me , in which you go thro ’ This delightfully dangerous journey , hold two , Some cavalier asks , with humility , whether You 'll venture down with him — you smile — ‘ tis a match ; In an instant you 're seated , and down both together Go thundering , as if you went post to old scratch !<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Well , it was but last night , as I stood and remarkt On the looks and odd ways of the girls who embarkt , The impatience of some for the perilous flight , The forced giggle of others , ‘ twixt pleasure and fright ,— That , there came up — imagine , dear DOLL , if you can — A fine sallow , sublime , sort of Werterfaced man , With mustachios that gave ( what we read of so oft ) The dear Corsair expression , half savage , half soft , As Hyenas in love may be fancied to look , or A something between ABELARD and old BLUCHER ! Up he came , DOLL , to me , and uncovering his head , ( Rather bald , but so warlike ! ) in bad English said , “ Ah ! my dear — if Ma'mselle vil be so very good — Just for von littel course ” — tho ’ I scarce understood What he wisht me to do , I said , thank him , I would . Off we set — and , tho ’ ‘ faith , dear , I hardly knew whether My head or my heels were the uppermost then , For ‘ twas like heaven and earth , DOLLY , coming together ,— Yet , spite of the danger , we dared it again . And oh ! as I gazed on the features and air Of the man , who for me all this peril defied , I could fancy almost he and I were a pair Of unhappy young lovers , who thus , side by side , Were taking , instead of rope , pistol , or dagger , a Desperate dash down the falls of Niagara ! This achieved , thro ’ the gardens we sauntered about , Saw the fire-works , exclaimed “ magnifique ! ” at each cracker , And , when ‘ twas all o'er , the dear man saw us out With the air I will say , of a Prince , to our fiacre . Now , hear me — this Stranger ,— it may be mere folly — But who do you think we all think it is , DOLLY ? Why , bless you , no less than the great King of Prussia , Who 's here now incog .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>— he , who made so much fuss , you Remember , in London , with BLUCHER and PLATOF , When SAL was near kissing old BLUCHER 'S cravat off ! Pa says he 's come here to look after his money , ( Not taking things now as he used under BONEY ,) Which suits with our friend , for BOB saw him , he swore , Looking sharp to the silver received at the door . Besides , too , they say that his grief for his Queen ( Which was plain in this sweet fellow 's face to be seen ) Requires such a stimulant dose as this car is , Used three times a day with young ladies in Paris . Some Doctor , indeed , has declared that such grief Should — unless ‘ twould to utter despairing its folly push — Fly to the Beaujon , and there seek relief By rattling , as BOB says , “ like shot thro ’ a holly-bush . ” I must now bid adieu ;— only think , DOLLY , think If this should be the King — I have scarce slept a wink With imagining how it will sound in the papers , And how all the Misses my good luck will grudge , When they read that Count RUPPIN , to drive away vapors , Has gone down the Beaujon with Miss BIDDY FUDGE .

Give me the useful peaching Rat ; Not things as mute as Punch , when bought , Whose wooden heads are all they 've brought ; Who , false enough to shirk their friends , But too faint-hearted to betray , Are , after all their twists and bends , But souls in Limbo , damned half way . No , no , we nobler vermin are A genus useful as we 're rare ; Midst all the things miraculous Of which your natural histories brag , The rarest must be Rats like us , Who let the cat out of the bag . Yet still these Tyros in the cause Deserve , I own , no small applause ; And they 're by us received and treated With all due honors — only seated In the inverse scale of their reward , The merely promised next my Lord ; Small pensions then , and so on , down , Rat after rat , they graduate Thro ’ job , red ribbon and silk gown , To Chancellorship and Marquisate .

I 'll ne'er forget the old maid 's alarm , When , feeling thus Miss Sukey Flirt , he Said , as he dropt her shrivelled arm , “ Damned bad this morning — only thirty ! ” Your dowagers , too , every one , So generous are , when they call him in , That he might now retire upon The rheumatisms of three old women . Then whatsoe'er your ailments are , He can so learnedly explain ye'em — Your cold of course is a catarrh , Your headache is a hemi-cranium :— His skill too in young ladies ’ lungs , The grace with which , most mild of men , He begs them to put out their tongues . Then bids them — put them in again ; In short , there 's nothing now like JACK !— Take all your doctors great and small , Of present times and ages back , Dear Doctor FUDGE is worth them all . So much for physic — then , in law too , Counsellor TIM , to thee we bow ; Not one of us gives more éclat to The immortal name of FUDGE than thou . Not to expatiate on the art With which you played the patriot 's part , Till something good and snug should offer ;— Like one , who , by the way he acts The enlightening part of candle-snuffer , The manager 's keen eye attracts , And is promoted thence by him To strut in robes , like thee , my TIM !— Who shall describe thy powers of face , Thy well-fed zeal in every case , Or wrong or right — but ten times warmer ( As suits thy calling ) in the former — Thy glorious , lawyer-like delight In puzzling all that 's clear and right , Which , tho ’ conspicuous in thy youth , Improves so with a wig and band on , That all thy pride 's to waylay Truth , And leave her not a leg to stand on . Thy patent prime morality ,— Thy cases cited from the Bible — Thy candor when it falls to thee To help in trouncing for a libel ;— “ God knows , I , from my soul , profess “ To hate all bigots and be-nighters ! “ God knows , I love , to even excess , “ The sacred Freedom of the Press , “ My only aim 's to — crush the writers . ” These are the virtues , TIM , that draw The briefs into thy bag so fast ; And these , oh TIM — if Law be Law — Will raise thee to the Bench at last . I blush to see this letter 's length — But ‘ twas my wish to prove to thee How full of hope , and wealth , and strength , Are all our precious family . And , should affairs go on as pleasant As , thank the Fates , they do at present — Should we but still enjoy the sway Of SIDMOUTH and of CASTLEREAGH , I hope , ere long , to see the day When England 's wisest statesmen , judges , Lawyers , peers , will all be — FUDGES ! Good-by — my paper 's out so nearly , I 've room only for Yours sincerely .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Lord C .' s tribute to the character of his friend , Mr. Reynolds , will long be remembered with equal credit to both .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>It was not under wigs , but tiaras , that King Midas endeavored to conceal these appendages .

LETTER VII . FROM PHELIM CONNOR TO —. Before we sketch the Present — let us cast A few , short , rapid glances to the Past . When he , who had defied all Europe 's strength , Beneath his own weak rashness sunk at length ;— When , loosed as if by magic from a chain That seemed like Fate 's the world was free again , And Europe saw , rejoicing in the sight , The cause of Kings , for once , the cause of Right ;— Then was , indeed , an hour of joy to those Who sighed for justice — liberty — repose , And hoped the fall of one great vulture 's nest Would ring its warning round , and scare the rest . All then was bright with promise ;— Kings began To own a sympathy with suffering Man , And man was grateful ; Patriots of the South Caught wisdom from a Cossack Emperor 's mouth , And heard , like accents thawed in Northern air , Unwonted words of freedom burst forth there ! Who did not hope , in that triumphant time , When monarchs , after years of spoil and crime , Met round the shrine of Peace , and Heaven lookt on ;— Who did not hope the lust of spoil was gone ; That that rapacious spirit , which had played The game of Pilnitz o'er so oft , was laid ; And Europe 's Rulers , conscious of the past , Would blush and deviate into right at last ? But no — the hearts , that nurst a hope so fair , Had yet to learn what men on thrones can dare ; Had yet to know , of all earth 's ravening things , The only quite untameable are Kings ! Scarce had they met when , to its nature true , The instinct of their race broke out anew ; Promises , treaties , charters , all were vain , And “ Rapine ! rapine ! ” was the cry again . How quick they carved their victims , and how well , Let Saxony , let injured Genoa tell ; -  Let all the human stock that , day by day , Was , at that Royal slave-mart , truckt away ,— The million souls that , in the face of heaven , Were split to fractions , bartered , sold or given To swell some despot Power , too huge before , And weigh down Europe with one Mammoth more . How safe the faith of Kings let France decide ;— Her charter broken , ere its ink had dried ;— Her Press enthralled — her Reason mockt again With all the monkery it had spurned in vain ; Her crown disgraced by one , who dared to own He thankt not France but England for his throne ; Her triumphs cast into the shade by those , Who had grown old among her bitterest foes , And now returned , beneath her conqueror 's shields , Unblushing slaves ! to claim her heroes ’ fields ; To tread down every trophy of her fame , And curse that glory which to them was shame !— Let these — let all the damning deeds , that then Were dared thro ’ Europe , cry aloud to men , With voice like that of crashing ice that rings Round Alpine huts , the perfidy of Kings ; And tell the world , when hawks shall harmless bear The shrinking dove , when wolves shall learn to spare The helpless victim for whose blood they lusted , Then and then only monarchs may be trusted . It could not last — these horrors could not last — France would herself have risen in might to cast The insulters off — and oh ! that then as now , Chained to some distant islet 's rocky brow , NAPOLEON ne'er had come to force , to blight , Ere half matured , a cause so proudly bright ;— To palsy patriot arts with doubt and shame , And write on Freedom 's flag a despot 's name ;— To rush into the list , unaskt , alone , And make the stake of all the game of one ! Then would the world have seen again what power A people can put forth in Freedom 's hour ; Then would the fire of France once more have blazed ;— For every single sword , reluctant raised In the stale cause of an oppressive throne , Millions would then have leaped forth in her own ; And never , never had the unholy stain Of Bourbon feet disgraced her shores again . But fate decreed not so — the Imperial Bird , That , in his neighboring cage , unfeared , unstirred , Had seemed to sleep with head beneath his wing , Yet watched the moment for a daring spring ;— Well might he watch , when deeds were done , that made His own transgressions whiten in their shade ; Well might he hope a world thus trampled o'er By clumsy tyrants would be his once more :— Forth from his cage the eagle burst ; to light , From steeple on to steeple<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>winged his flight , With calm and easy grandeur , to that throne From which a Royal craven just had flown ; And resting there , as in his eyry , furled Those wings , whose very rustling shook the world ! What was your fury then , ye crowned array , Whose feast of spoil , whose plundering holiday Was thus broke up , in all its greedy mirth , By one bold chieftain 's stamp on Gallic earth ! Fierce was the cry , and fulminant the ban ,— “ Assassinate , who will — enchain , who can , “ The vile , the faithless , outlawed , lowborn man ! ” “ Faithless ! ” — and this from you — from you , forsooth , Ye pious Kings , pure paragons of truth , Whose honesty all knew , for all had tried ; Whose true Swiss zeal had served on every side ; Whose fame for breaking faith so long was known , Well might ye claim the craft as all your own , And lash your lordly tails and fume to see Such low-born apes of Royal perfidy ! Yes — yes — to you alone did it belong To sin for ever , and yet ne'er do wrong ,— The frauds , the lies of Lords legitimate Are but fine policy , deep strokes of state ; But let some upstart dare to soar so high In Kingly craft , and “ outlaw ” is the cry ! What , tho ’ long years of mutual treachery Had peopled full your diplomatic shelves With ghosts of treaties , murdered ‘ mong yourselves ; Tho ’ each by turns was knave and dupe — what then ? A holy League would set all straight again ; Like JUNO 'S virtue , which a dip or two In some blest fountain made as good as new ! Most faithful Russia — faithful to whoe'er Could plunder best and give him amplest share ; Who , even when vanquisht , sure to gain his ends , For want of foes to rob , made free with friends ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>And , deepening still by amiable gradations , When foes were stript of all , then fleeced relations !<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Most mild and saintly Prussia — steeped to the ears In persecuted Poland 's blood and tears , And now , with all her harpy wings outspread O'er severed Saxony 's devoted head ! Pure Austria too — whose history naught repeats But broken leagues and subsidized defeats ; Whose faith , as Prince , extinguisht Venice shows , Whose faith , as man , a widowed daughter knows ! And thou , oh England — who , tho ’ once as shy As cloistered maids , of shame or perfidy , Art now broke in , and , thanks to CASTLEREAGH , In all that 's worst and falsest lead'st the way ! Such was the pure divan , whose pens and wits The escape from Elba frightened into fits ;— Such were the saints , who doomed NAPOLEON 'S life , In virtuous frenzy , to the assassin 's knife . Disgusting crew !— who would not gladly fly To open , downright , bold-faced tyranny , To honest guilt , that dares do all but lie , From the false , juggling craft of men like these , Their canting crimes and varnisht villanies ;— These Holy Leaguers , who then loudest boast Of faith and honor , when they 've stained them most ; From whose affection men should shrink as loath As from their hate , for they 'll be fleeced by both ; Who , even while plundering , forge Religion 's name To frank their spoil , and without fear or shame Call down the Holy Trinity<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>to bless Partition leagues and deeds of devilishness ! But hold — enough — soon would this swell of rage O'erflow the boundaries of my scanty page ;— So , here I pause — farewell — another day , Return we to those Lords of prayer and prey , Whose loathsome cant , whose frauds by right divine , Deserve a lash — oh ! weightier far than mine !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Napoleon 's Proclamation on landing from Elba .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>At the Peace of Tilsit , where he abandoned his ally , Prussia , to France , and received a portion of her territory .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The seizure of Finland from his relative of Sweden .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The usual preamble of these flagitious compacts .

FROM MR. BOB FUDGE TO RICHARD ——, ESQ . Dear DICK , while old DONALDSON 'S<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>mending my stays ,— Which I knew would go smash with me one of these days , And , at yesterday 's dinner , when , full to the throttle , We lads had begun our dessert with a bottle Of neat old Constantia , on my leaning back Just to order another , by Jove , I went crack !— Or , as honest TOM said , in his nautical phrase , “ Damn my eyes , BOB , in doubling the Cape you 've missed stays . "[ 2 ] So , of course , as no gentleman 's seen out without them , They 're now at the Schneider 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>— and , while he 's about them , Here goes for a letter , post-haste , neck and crop . Let us see — in my last I was — where did I stop ? Oh ! I know — at the Boulevards , as motley a road as Man ever would wish a day 's lounging upon ; With its cafés and gardens , hotels and pagodas , Its founts and old Counts sipping beer in the sun : With its houses of all architectures you please , From the Grecian and Gothic , DICK , down by degrees To the pure Hottentot or the Brighton Chinese ; Where in temples antique you may breakfast or dinner it , Lunch at a mosque and see Punch from a minaret . Then , DICK , the mixture of bonnets and bowers . Of foliage and frippery , fiacres and flowers , Green-grocers , green gardens — one hardly knows whether ‘ Tis country or town , they 're so messed up together ! And there , if one loves the romantic , one sees Jew clothes-men , like shepherds , reclined under trees ; Or Quidnuncs , on Sunday , just fresh from the barber 's , Enjoying their news and groseille<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>in those arbors ; While gayly their wigs , like the tendrils , are curling , And founts of red currant-juice<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>round them are purling . Here , DICK , arm in arm as we chattering stray , And receive a few civil “ Goddems ” by the way ,— For , ‘ tis odd , these mounseers ,— tho ’ we 've wasted our wealth And our strength , till we 've thrown ourselves into a phthisic ;— To cram down their throats an old King for their health . As we whip little children to make them take physic ;— Yet , spite of our good-natured money and slaughter , They hate us , as Beelzebub hates holy-water ! But who the deuce cares , DICK , as long as they nourish us Neatly as now , and good cookery flourishes — Long as , by bayonets protected , we Natties May have our full fling at their salmis and pâtés ? And , truly , I always declared ‘ twould be pity To burn to the ground such a choice-feeding city . Had Dad but his way , he 'd have long ago blown The whole batch to old Nick — and the people , I own , If for no other cause than their curst monkey looks , Well deserve a blow-up — but then , damn it , their Cooks ! As to Marshals , and Statesmen , and all their whole lineage , For aught that I care , you may knock them to spinage ; But think , DICK , their Cooks — what a loss to mankind ! What a void in the world would their art leave behind ! Their chronometer spits — their intense salamanders — Their ovens — their pots , that can soften old ganders , All vanisht for ever ,— their miracles o'er , And the Marmite Perpétuelle bubbling no more ! Forbid it , forbid it , ye Holy Allies ! Take whatever ye fancy — take statues , take money — But leave them , oh leave them , their Perigueux pies , Their glorious goose-livers and high pickled tunny ! Tho ’ many , I own , are the evils they 've brought us , Tho ’ Royalty 's here on her very last legs , Yet who can help loving the land that has taught us Six hundred and eighty-five ways to dress eggs ? You see , DICK , in spite of them cries of “ God-dam , ” “ Coquin Anglais , ” et cetera — how generous I am ! And now ( to return , once again , to my “ Day , ” Which will take us all night to get thro ’ in this way . ) From the Boulevards we saunter thro ’ many a street , Crack jokes on the natives — mine , all very neat — Leave the Signs of the Times to political fops , And find twice as much fun in the Signs of the Shops ;— Here , a Louis Dix-huit — there , a Martinmas goose , ( Much in vogue since your eagles are gone out of use ) — Henri Quatres in shoals , and of Gods a great many , But Saints are the most on hard duty of any :— St. TONY , who used all temptations to spurn , Here hangs o'er a beer-shop , and tempts in his turn ; While there St. VENECIA<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>sits hemming and frilling her Holy mouchoir o'er the door of some milliner ;— Saint AUSTIN 'S the “ outward and visible sign “ Of an inward ” cheap dinner , and pint of small wine ; While St. DENYS hangs out o'er some hatter of ton , And possessing , good bishop , no head of his own ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Takes an interest in Dandies , who 've got — next to none ! Then we stare into shops — read the evening 's affiches — Or , if some , who 're Lotharios in feeding , should wish Just to flirt with a luncheon , ( a devilish bad trick , As it takes off the bloom of one 's appetite , DICK . ) To the Passage des — what d'ye call't — des Panoramas<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>We quicken our pace , and there heartily cram as Seducing young pâtés , as ever could cozen One out of one 's appetite , down by the dozen . We vary , of course — petits pâtés do one day , The next we 've our lunch with the Gauffrier Hollandais ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>That popular artist , who brings out , like SCOTT , His delightful productions so quick , hot and hot ; Not the worse for the exquisite comment that follows ,— Divine maresquino , which — Lord , how one swallows ! Once more , then , we saunter forth after our snack , or Subscribe a few francs for the price of a fiacre , And drive far away to the old Montagnes Russes , Where we find a few twirls in the car of much use To regenerate the hunger and thirst of us sinners , Who 've lapst into snacks — the perdition of dinners . And here , DICK — in answer to one of your queries , About which we Gourmands have had much discussion — I 've tried all these mountains , Swiss , French , and Ruggieri 's , And think , for digestion ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>there 's none like the Russian ; So equal the motion — so gentle , tho ’ fleet — It in short such a light and salubrious scamper is , That take whom you please — take old Louis DIX-HUIT , And stuff him — ay , up to the neck — with stewed lampreys ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>So wholesome these Mounts , such a solvent I 've found them , That , let me but rattle the Monarch well down them , The fiend , Indigestion , would fly far away , And the regicide lampreys<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>be foiled of their prey ! Such , DICK , are the classical sports that content us , Till five o'clock brings on that hour so momentous , That epoch — but whoa ! my lad — here comes the Schneider , And , curse him , has made the stays three inches wider — Too wide by an inch and a half — what a Guy ! But , no matter — ‘ twill all be set right by-and-by . As we 've MASSINOT 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>eloquent carte to eat still up . An inch and a half 's but a trifle to fill up . So — not to lose time , DICK — here goes for the task ; Au revoir , my old boy — of the Gods I but ask That my life , like “ the Leap of the German , ” may be , “ Du lit à la table , d'la table du lit ! ” R.

LETTER IX . PROM PHIL . FUDGE , ESQ ., TO THE LORD VISCOUNT CASTLEREAGH . My Lord , the Instructions , brought to-day , “ I shall in all my best obey . ” Your Lordship talks and writes so sensibly ! And — whatsoe'er some wags may say — Oh ! not at all incomprehensibly . I feel the inquiries in your letter About my health and French most flattering ; Thank ye , my French , tho ’ somewhat better , Is , on the whole , but weak and smattering :— Nothing , of course , that can compare With his who made the Congress stare ( A certain Lord we need not name ) , Who , even in French , would have his trope , And talk of “ batir un systême “ Sur l'équilibre de l'Europe ! ” Sweet metaphor !— and then the Epistle , Which bid the Saxon King go whistle ,— That tender letter to “ Mon Prince "[ 1 ] Which showed alike thy French and sense ;— Oh no , my Lord — there 's none can do Or say un-English things like you : And , if the schemes that fill thy breast Could but a vent congenial seek , And use the tongue that suits them best , What charming Turkish wouldst thou speak ! But as for me , a Frenchless grub , At Congress never born to stammer , Nor learn like thee , my Lord , to snub Fallen Monarchs , out of CHAMBAUD 'S grammar — Bless you , you do not , can not , know How far a little French will go ; For all one 's stock , one need but draw On some half-dozen words like toese — Comme ça — par-là — là-bas — ah ha ! They 'll take you all thro ’ France with ease . Your Lordship 's praises of the scraps I sent you from my Journal lately , ( Enveloping a few laced caps For Lady C ,) delight me greatly . Her flattering speech — “ What pretty things “ One finds in Mr. FUDGE 's pages ! ” Is praise which ( as some poet sings ) Would pay one for the toils of ages . Thus flattered , I presume to send A few more extracts by a friend ; And I should hope they 'll be no less Approved of than my last MS .— The former ones , I fear , were creased , As BIDDY round the caps would pin them ; But these will come to hand , at least Unrumpled , for there 's — nothing in them . Extracts from Mr. Fudge 's Journal , addressed to Lord C. August 10 . Went to the Mad-house — saw the man<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Who thinks , poor wretch , that , while the Fiend Of Discord here full riot ran , He , like the rest , was guillotined ;— But that when , under BONEY 'S reign , ( A more discreet , tho ’ quite as strong one ,) The heads were all restored again , He , in the scramble , got a wrong one . Accordingly , he still cries out This strange head fits him most unpleasantly ; And always runs , poor devil , about , Inquiring for his own incessantly ! While to his case a tear I dropt , And sauntered home , thought I — ye Gods ! How many heads might thus be swopt , And , after all , not make much odds ! For instance , there 's VANSITTART 'S head — ( “ Tam carum ” it may well be said ) If by some curious chance it came To settle on BILL SOAMES 'S<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>shoulders , The effect would turn out much the same On all respectable cash-holders ; Except that while , in its new socket , The head was planning schemes to win A zig-zag way into one 's pocket , The hands would plunge directly in . Good Viscount SIDMOUTH , too , instead Of his own grave , respected head , Might wear ( for aught I see that bars ) Old Lady WILHELMINA FRUMP 'S — So while the hand signed Circulars , The head might lisp out “ What is trumps ? ” — The REGENT 'S brains could we transfer To some robust man-milliner , The shop , the shears , the lace , and ribbon Would go , I doubt not , quite as glib on ; And , vice versa , take the pains To give the PRINCE the shopman 's brains , One only change from thence would flow , Ribbons would not be wasted so . ‘ Twas thus I pondered on , my Lord ; And , even at night , when laid in bed , I found myself , before I snored , Thus chopping , swopping head for head . At length I thought , fantastic elf ! How such a change would suit myself . ‘ Twixt sleep and waking , one by one , With various pericraniums saddled , At last I tried your Lordship 's on , And then I grew completely addled — Forgot all other heads , od rot ‘ em ! And slept , and dreamt that I was — BOTTOM . August 21 . Walked out with daughter BID — was shown The House of Commons and the Throne , Whose velvet cushion 's just the same NAPOLEON sat on — what a shame ! Oh ! can we wonder , best of speechers , When LOUIS seated thus we see , That France 's “ fundamental features ” Are much the same they used to be ? However ,— God preserve the Throne , And cushion too — and keep them free ; From accidents , which have been known To happen even to Royalty !<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>August 28 . Read , at a stall ( for oft one pops On something at these stalls and shops , That does to quote and gives one 's Book A classical and knowing look .— Indeed , I 've found , in Latin , lately , A course of stalls improves me greatly ) — ‘ Twas thus I read that in the East A monarch 's fat 's a serious matter ; And once in every year , at least , He 's weighed — to see if he gets fatter :[ 5 ] Then , if a pound or two he be Increased , there 's quite a jubilee !<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Suppose , my Lord — and far from me To treat such things with levity — But just suppose the Regent 's weight Were made thus an affair of state ; And , every sessions , at the close ,— ‘ Stead of a speech , which , all can see , is Heavy and dull enough , God knows — We were to try how heavy he is . Much would it glad all hearts to hear — That , while the Nation 's Revenue Loses so many pounds a year , The PRINCE , God bless him ! gains a few . With bales of muslin , chintzes , spices , I see the Easterns weigh their Kings ;— But , for the REGENT , my advice is , We should throw in much heavier things : For instance —— -  ‘ s quarto volumes , Which , tho ’ not spices , serve to wrap them ; Dominie STODDART 'S Daily columns , “ Prodigious ! ” — in , of course , we 'd clap them — Letters , that CARTWRIGHT 'S<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>pen indites , In which , with logical confusion , The Major like a Minor writes , And never comes to a Conclusion :— Lord SOMERS 'S pamphlet — or his head — ( Ah ! that were worth its weight in lead ! ) Along with which we in may whip , sly , The Speeches of Sir JOHN COX HIPPISLY ; That Baronet of many words , Who loves so , in the House of Lords , To whisper Bishops — and so nigh Unto their wigs in whispering goes , That you may always know him by A patch of powder on his nose !— If this won  t do , we in must cram The “ Reasons ” of Lord BUCKINGHAM ; ( A Book his Lordship means to write , Entitled “ Reasons for my Ratting ":) Or , should these prove too small and light , His rump 's a host — we 'll bundle that in ! And , still should all these masses fail To stir the REGENT 'S pondrous scale , Why , then , my Lord , in heaven 's name , Pitch in , without reserve or stint , The whole of RAGLEY 'S beauteous Dame — If that won  t raise him , devil 's in it !

Consulted MURPHY 'S TACITUS About those famous spies at Rome ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Whom certain Whigs — to make a fuss — Describe as much resembling us , Informing gentlemen , at home . But , bless the fools , they can n't be serious , To say Lord SIDMOUTH 'S like TIBERIUS ! What ! he , the Peer , that injures no man , Like that severe , blood-thirsty Roman !— ‘ Tis true , the Tyrant lent an ear to All sorts of spies — so doth the Peer , too . ‘ Tis true , my Lord 's elect tell fibs , And deal in perjury — ditto TIB 's . ‘ Tis true , the Tyrant screened and hid His rogues from justice — ditto SID . ‘ Tis true the Peer is grave and glib At moral speeches — ditto TIB . ‘ Tis true the feats the Tyrant did Were in his dotage — ditto SID . So far , I own , the parallel ‘ Twixt TIB and SIB goes vastly well ; But there are points in TIB that strike My humble mind as much more like Yourself , my dearest Lord , or him , Of the India Board — that soul of whim ! Like him , TIBERIUS loved his joke , On matters , too , where few can bear one ; E. g. a man cut up , or broke Upon the wheel — a devilish fair one ! Your common fractures , wounds and fits , Are nothing to such wholesale wits ; But , let the sufferer gasp for life , The joke is then , worth any money ; And , if he writhe beneath a knife ,— Oh dear , that 's something quite too funny . In this respect , my Lord , you see The Roman wag and ours agree : Now as to your resemblance — mum — This parallel we need not follow : Tho ’ ‘ tis , in Ireland , said by some Your Lordship beats TIBERIUS hollow ; Whips , chains — but these are things too serious For me to mention or discuss ; Whene'er your Lordship acts TIBERIUS , PHIL . FUDGE 'S part is Tacitus ! September 2 . Was thinking , had Lord SIDMOUTH got Any good decent sort of Plot Against the winter-time — if not , Alas , alas , our ruin 's fated ; All done up and spiflicated !

FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ——. Well , it is n't the King , after all , my dear creature ! But do n't you go laugh , now — there 's nothing to quiz i n't — For grandeur of air and for grimness of feature , He might be a King , DOLL , tho ’ , hang him , he is n't . At first , I felt hurt , for I wisht it , I own , If for no other cause but to vex Miss MALONE ,— ( The great heiress , you know , of Shandangan , who 's here , Showing off with such airs , and a real Cashmere , While mine 's but a paltry , old rabbit-skin , dear ! ) But Pa says , on deeply considering the thing , “ I am just as well pleased it should not be the King ; “ As I think for my BIDDY , so gentille and jolie . “ Whose charms may their price in an honest way fetch , “ That a Brandenburgh ” — ( what is a Brandenburgh , DOLLY ? ) — “ Would be , after all , no such very great catch . “ If the REGENT indeed ” — added he , looking sly — ( You remember that comical squint of his eye ) But I stopt him with “ La , Pa , how can you say so , “ When the REGENT loves none but old women , you know ! ” Which is fact , my dear DOLLY — we , girls of eighteen , And so slim — Lord , he 'd think us not fit to be seen : And would like us much better as old-as , as old As that Countess of DESMOND , of whom I 've been told That she lived to much more than a hundred and ten , And was killed by a fall from a cherry-tree then ! What a frisky old girl ! but — to come to my lover , Who , tho ’ not a King , is a hero I 'll swear ,— You shall hear all that 's happened , just briefly run over , Since that happy night , when we whiskt thro ’ the air ! Let me see — ‘ twas on Saturday — yes , DOLLY , yes — From that evening I date the first dawn of my bliss ; When we both rattled off in that dear little carriage , Whose journey , BOB says , is so like Love and Marriage , “ Beginning gay , desperate , dashing , down-hilly , “ And ending as dull as a six-inside Dilly ! "[ 1 ] Well , scarcely a wink did I sleep the night thro ’ ; And , next day , having scribbled my letter to you , With a heart full of hope this sweet fellow to meet , I set out with Papa , to see Louis DIX-HUIT Make his bow to some half-dozen women and boys , Who get up a small concert of shrill Vive le Rois - And how vastly genteeler , my dear , even this is , Than vulgar Pall-Mall 's oratorio of hisses ! The gardens seemed full — so , of Course , we walkt o'er ‘ em , ‘ Mong orange-trees , clipt into town-bred decorum , And daphnes and vases and many a statue There staring , with not even a stitch on them , at you ! The ponds , too , we viewed — stood awhile on the brink To contemplate the play of those pretty gold fishes — “ Live bullion , ” says merciless BOB , “ which , I think , “ Would , if coined , with a little mint sauce , be delicious ! ” But what , DOLLY , what , is the gay orange-grove , Or gold fishes , to her that 's in search of her love ? In vain did I wildly explore every chair Where a thing like a man was — no lover sat there ! In vain my fond eyes did I eagerly cast At the whiskers , mustachios and wigs that went past , To obtain if I could but a glance at that curl ,— A glimpse of those whiskers , as sacred , my girl , As the lock that , Pa says ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>is to Mussulman given , For the angel to hold by that “ lugs them to heaven ! ” Alas , there went by me full many a quiz , And mustachios in plenty , but nothing like his ! Disappointed , I found myself sighing out “ well-a-day , ” — Thought of the words of TOM MOORE 'S Irish Melody , Something about the “ green spot of delight ” ( Which , you know , Captain MACKINTOSH sung to us one day ): Ah DOLLY , my “ spot ” was that Saturday night , And its verdure , how fleeting , had withered by Sunday ! We dined at a tavern — La , what do I say ? If BOB was to know !— a Restaurateur 's , dear ; Where your properest ladies go dine every day , And drink Burgundy out of large tumblers , like beer . Fine BOB ( for he 's really grown super-fine ) Condescended for once to make one of the party ; Of course , tho ’ but three , we had dinner for nine , And in spite of my grief , love , I own I ate hearty . Indeed , DOLL , I know not how ‘ tis , but , in grief , I have always found eating a wondrous relief ; And BOB , who 's in love , said he felt the same , quite — “ My sighs , ” said he , “ ceased with the first glass I drank you ; “ The lamb made me tranquil , the puffs made me light , “ And — now that all 's o'er — why , I 'm — pretty well , thank you ! ” To my great annoyance , we sat rather late ; For BOBBY and Pa had a furious debate About singing and cookery — BOBBY , of course , Standing up for the latter Fine Art in full force ; And Pa saying , “ God only knows which is worst , “ The French Singers or Cooks , but I wish us well over it — “ What with old LAÏ 'S and VÉRY , I 'm curst “ If my head or my stomach will ever recover it ! ” ‘ Twas dark when we got to the Boulevards to stroll , And in vain did I look ‘ mong the street Macaronis , When , sudden it struck me — last hope of my soul — That some angel might take the dear man to TORTONI 'S !<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>We entered — and , scarcely had BOB , with an air , For a grappe à la jardinière called to the waiters , When , oh DOLL ! I saw him — my hero was there ( For I knew his white small-clothes and brown leather gaiters ) , A group of fair statues from Greece smiling o'er him ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>And lots of red currant-juice sparkling before him ! Oh ! DOLLY , these heroes — what creatures they are ; In the boudoir the same as in fields full of slaughter ! As cool in the Beaujon 's precipitous car , As when safe at TORTONI 'S , o'er iced currant water ! He joined us — imagine , dear creature , my ecstasy — Joined by the man I 'd have broken ten necks to see ! BOB wished to treat him with Punch à la glace , But the sweet fellow swore that my beaute , my grâce , And my ja-ne-sais-quoi ( then his whiskers he twirled ) Were to him , “ on de top of all Ponch in de vorld . ” — How pretty !— tho ’ oft ( as of course it must be ) Both his French and his English are Greek , DOLL , to me . But , in short , I felt happy as ever fond heart did ; And happier still , when ‘ twas fixt , ere we parted , That , if the next day should be pastoral weather . We all would set off , in French buggies , together , To see Montmorency — that place which , you know , Is so famous for cherries and JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU . His card then he gave us — the name , rather creased — But ‘ twas CALICOT — something — a Colonel , at least ! After which — sure there never was hero so civil — he Saw us safe home to our door in Rue Rivoli , Where his last words , as , at parting , he threw A soft look o'er his shoulders , were — “ How do you do ! ” But , lord !— there 's Papa for the post — I 'm so vext — Montmorency must now , love , be kept for my next . That dear Sunday night — I was charmingly drest , And — so providential !— was looking my best ; Such a sweet muslin gown , with a flounce — and my frills , You 've no notion how rich — ( tho ’ Pa has by the bills ) And you 'd smile had you seen , when we sat rather near , Colonel CALICOT eyeing the cambric , my dear . Then the flowers in my bonnet — but , la ! it 's in vain — So , good-by , my sweet DOLL — I shall soon write again . B. F. Nota bene — our love to all neighbors about — Your Papa in particular — how is his gout ? P. S .— I 've just opened my letter to say , In your next you must tell me , ( now do , DOLLY , pray , For I hate to ask BOB , he 's so ready to quiz ,) What sort of a thing , dear , a Brandenburgh is .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The cars , on return , are dragged up slowly by a chain .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>For this scrap of knowledge “ Pa ” was , I suspect , indebted to a note upon Volney 's “ Ruins : ” “ It is by this tuft of hair ( on the crown of the head ) , worn by the majority of Mussulmans , that the Angel of the Tomb is to take the elect and carry them to Paradise . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>A fashionable café glacier on the Italian Boulevards .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>“ You eat your ice at Tortoni 's , ” says Mr. Scott , “ under a Grecian group . ” LETTER XI . FROM PHELIM CONNOR TO ——. Yes , ‘ twas a cause , as noble and as great As ever hero died to vindicate — A Nation 's right to speak a Nation 's voice , And own no power but of the Nation 's choice ! Such was the grand , the glorious cause that now Hung trembling on NAPOLEON 'S single brow ; Such the sublime arbitrament , that poured , In patriot eyes , a light around his sword , A hallowing light , which never , since the day Of his young victories , had illumed its way ! Oh ‘ twas not then the time for tame debates , Ye men of Gaul , when chains were at your gates ; When he , who late had fled your Chieftain 's eye . As geese from eagles on Mount Taurus fly ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Denounced against the land , that spurned his chain , Myriads of swords to bind it fast again — Myriads of fierce invading swords , to track Thro ’ your best blood his path of vengeance back ; When Europe 's Kings , that never yet combined But ( like those upper Stars , that , when conjoined , Shed war and pestilence ,) to scourge mankind , Gathered around , with hosts from every shore , Hating NAPOLEON much , but Freedom more , And , in that coming strife , appalled to see The world yet left one chance for liberty !— No , ‘ twas not then the time to weave a net Of bondage round your Chief ; to curb and fret Your veteran war-horse , pawing for the fight , When every hope was in his speed and might — To waste the hour of action in dispute , And coolly plan how freedom 's boughs should shoot , When your Invader 's axe was at the root ! No sacred Liberty ! that God , who throws , Thy light around , like His own sunshine , knows How well I love thee and how deeply hate All tyrants , upstart and Legitimate — Yet , in that hour , were France my native land , I would have followed , with quick heart and hand , NAPOLEON , NERO — ay , no matter whom — To snatch my country from that damning doom , That deadliest curse that on the conquered waits — A Conqueror 's satrap , throned within her gates ! True , he was false — despotic — all you please — Had trampled down man 's holiest liberties — Had , by a genius , formed for nobler things Than lie within the grasp of vulgar Kings , But raised the hopes of men — as eaglets fly With tortoises aloft into the sky — To dash them down again more shatteringly !

LETTER XII . FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MISS DOROTHY ——. At last , DOLLY ,— thanks to potent emetic , Which BOBBY and Pa , grimace sympathetic , Have swallowed this morning , to balance the bliss , Of an eel matelote and a bisque d'écrevisses — I 've a morning at home to myself , and sit down To describe you our heavenly trip out of town . How agog you must be for this letter , my dear ! Lady JANE , in the novel , less languisht to hear , If that elegant cornet she met at Lord NEVILLE 'S Was actually dying with love or — blue devils . But Love , DOLLY , Love is the theme I pursue ; With Blue Devils , thank heaven , I have nothing to do — Except , indeed , dear Colonel CALICOT spies Any imps of that color in certain blue eyes , Which he stares at till I , DOLL , at his do the same ; Then he simpers — I blush — and would often exclaim , If I knew but the French for it , “ Lord , Sir , for shame ! ” Well , the morning was lovely — the trees in full dress For the happy occasion — the sunshine express — Had we ordered it , dear , of the best poet going , It scarce could be furnisht more golden and glowing . Tho ’ late when we started , the scent of the air Was like GATTIE 'S rose-water ,— and , bright , here and there , On the grass an odd dew-drop was glittering yet , Like my aunt 's diamond pin on her green tabbinet ! While the birds seemed to warble as blest on the boughs , As if each a plumed Calicot had for her spouse ; And the grapes were all blushing and kissing in rows , And — in short , need I tell you wherever one goes With the creature one loves , ‘ tis couleur de rose ; And ah ! I shall ne'er , lived I ever so long , see A day such as that at divine Montmorency ! There was but one drawback — at first when we started , The Colonel and I were inhumanly parted ; How cruel — young hearts of such moments to rob ! He went in Pa 's buggy , and I went with BOB : And , I own , I felt spitefully happy to know That Papa and his comrade agreed but so-so . For the Colonel , it seems , is a stickler of BONEY 'S — Served with him of course — nay , I 'm sure they were cronies . So martial his features ! dear DOLL , you can trace Ulm , Austerlitz , Lodi , as plain in his face As you do on that pillar of glory and brass ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Which the poor DUC DE BERRI must hate so to pass ! It appears , too , he made — as most foreigners do — About English affairs an odd blunder or two . For example misled by the names , I dare say — He confounded JACK CASTLES with LORD CASTLEREAGH ; And — sure such a blunder no mortal hit ever on — Fancied the present Lord CAMDEN the clever one ! But politics ne'er were the sweet fellow 's trade ; ‘ Twas for war and the ladies my Colonel was made . And oh ! had you heard , as together we walkt Thro ’ that beautiful forest , how sweetly he talkt ; And how perfectly well he appeared , DOLL , to know All the life and adventures of JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU ?— “ ‘ Twas there , ” said he — not that his words I can state — ‘ Twas a gibberish that Cupid alone could translate ;— But “ there , ” said he , ( pointing where , small and remote , The dear Hermitage rose ) , “ there his JULIE he wrote ,— “ Upon paper gilt-edged , without blot or erasure ; “ Then sauded it over with silver and azure , “ And — oh , what will genius and fancy not do !— “ Tied the leaves up together with nonpareille blue ! ” What a trait of Rousseau ! what a crowd of emotions From sand and blue ribbons are conjured up here ! Alas , that a man of such exquisite notions Should send his poor brats to the Foundling , my dear ! “ ‘ Twas here too perhaps , ” Colonel CALICOT said — As down the small garden he pensively led — ( Tho ’ once I could see his sublime forehead wrinkle With rage not to find there the loved periwinkle ) “ ‘ Twas here he received from the fair D'ÉPINAY “ ( Who called him so sweetly her Bear , every day ,) “ That dear flannel petticoat , pulled off to form “ A waistcoat , to keep the enthusiast warm ! ” Such , DOLL , were the sweet recollections we pondered , As , full of romance , thro ’ that valley we wandered . The flannel ( one 's train of ideas , how odd it is ! ) Led us to talk about other commodities , Cambric , and silk , and — I ne'er shall forget , For the sun was then hastening in pomp to its set . And full on the Colonel 's dark whiskers shone down , When he askt me , with eagerness ,— who made my gown ? The question confused me — for , DOLL , you must know , And I ought to have told my best friend long ago , That , by Pa 's strict command , I no longer employ<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>That enchanting couturière , Madame LE ROI ; But am forced now to have VICTORINE , who — deuce take her !— It seems is , at present , the King 's mantua-maker — I mean of his party — and , tho ’ much the smartest , LE ROI is condemned as a rank Bonapartist .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Think , DOLL , how confounded I lookt — so well knowing The Colonel 's opinions — my cheeks were quite glowing ; I stammered out something — nay , even half named The legitimate sempstress , when , loud , he exclaimed , “ Yes ; yes , by the stitching ‘ tis plain to be seen “ It was made by that Bourbonite bitch , VICTORINE ! ” What a word for a hero !— but heroes will err , And I thought , dear , I 'd tell you things just as they were . Besides tho ’ the word on good manners intrench , I assure you ‘ tis not half so shocking in French . But this cloud , tho ’ embarrassing , soon past away , And the bliss altogether , the dreams of that day , The thoughts that arise , when such dear fellows woo us ,— The nothings that then , love , are — everything to us — That quick correspondence of glances and sighs , And what BOB calls the “ Two-penny-post of the Eyes ” — Ah , DOLL ! tho ’ I know you 've a heart , ‘ tis in vain , To a heart so unpractised these things to explain . They can only be felt , in their fulness divine , By her who has wandered , at evening 's decline , Thro ’ a valley like that , with a Colonel like mine ! But here I must finish — for BOB , my dear DOLLY , Whom physic , I find , always makes melancholy , Is seized with a fancy for churchyard reflections ; And , full of all yesterday 's rich recollections , Is just setting off for Montmartre — “ for there is , ” Said he , looking solemn , “ the tomb of the VÉRYS !<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>“ Long , long have I wisht as a votary true , “ O'er the grave of such talents to utter my moans ; “ And , to-day — as my stomach is not in good cue “ For the flesh of the VÉRYS — I 'll visit their bones ! ” He insists upon my going with him — how teasing !

Oh , DOLLY , dear DOLLY , I 'm ruined for ever — I ne'er shall be happy again , DOLLY , never ! To think of the wretch — what a victim was I ! ‘ Tis too much to endure — I shall die , I shall die — “ My brain 's in a fever — my pulses beat quick — I shall die or at least be exceedingly sick !

But — ye Gods , what a phantom !— I thought I should drop — There he stood , my dear DOLLY — no room for a doubt — There , behind the vile counter , these eyes saw him stand , With a piece of French cambric , before him rolled out , And that horrid yard-measure upraised in his hand !

The man , whom I fondly had fancied a King , And , when that too delightful illusion was past , As a hero had worshipt — vile , treacherous thing — To turn out but a low linen-draper at last ! My head swam around — the wretch smiled , I believe , But his smiling , alas , could no longer deceive — I fell back on BOB — my whole heart seemed to wither — And , pale as a ghost , I was carried back hither ! I only remember that BOB , as I caught him , With cruel facetiousness said , “ Curse the Kiddy ! “ A stanch Revolutionist always I 've thought him , “ But now I find out he 's a Counter one , BIDDY ! ” Only think , my dear creature , if this should be known To that saucy , satirical thing , Miss MALONE !

THE FUDGES IN ENGLAND BEING A SEQUEL TO THE “ FUDGE FAMILY IN PARIS . ” PREFACE . The name of the country town , in England — a well-known fashionable watering-place — in which the events that gave rise to the following correspondence occurred , is , for obvious reasons , suppressed . The interest attached , however , to the facts and personages of the story , renders it independent of all time and place ; and when it is recollected that the whole train of romantic circumstances so fully unfolded in these Letters has passed during the short period which has now elapsed since the great Meetings in Exeter Hall , due credit will , it is hoped , be allowed to the Editor for the rapidity with which he has brought the details before the Public ; while , at the same time any errors that may have been the result of such haste will , he trusts , with equal consideration , be pardoned . THE FUDGES IN ENGLAND LETTER I . FROM PATRICK MAGAN , ESQ ., TO THE REV . RICHARD ——; CURATE OF ——, IN IRELAND . Who d ’ ye think we 've got here ?— quite reformed from the giddy . Fantastic young thing that once made such a noise — Why , the famous Miss Fudge — that delectable Biddy , Whom you and I saw once at Paris , when boys , In the full blaze of bonnets , and ribands , and airs — Such a thing as no rainbow hath colors to paint ; Ere time had reduced her to wrinkles and prayers , And the Flirt found a decent retreat in the Saint . Poor “ Pa ” hath popt off — gone , as charity judges , To some choice Elysium reserved for the Fudges ; And Miss , with a fortune , besides expectations From some much revered and much palsied relations , Now wants but a husband , with requisites meet ,— Age , thirty , or thereabouts — stature six feet , And warranted godly — to make all complete . Nota bene — a Churchman would suit , if he 's high , But Socinians or Catholics need not apply . What say you , Dick ? doesn  t this tempt your ambition ? The whole wealth of Fudge , that renowned man of pith . All brought to the hammer , for Church competition ,— Sole encumbrance , Miss Fudge to be taken therewith . Think , my boy , for a Curate how glorious a catch ! While , instead of the thousands of souls you now watch , To save Biddy Fudge 's is all you need do ; And her purse will meanwhile be the saving of you . You may ask , Dick , how comes it that I , a poor elf , Wanting substance even more than your spiritual self , Should thus generously lay my own claims on the shelf , When , God knows ! there ne'er was young gentleman yet So much lackt an old spinster to rid him from debt , Or had cogenter reasons than mine to assail her With tender love-suit — at the suit of his tailor . But thereby there hangs a soft secret , my friend , Which thus to your reverend breast I commend : Miss Fudge hath a niece — such a creature !— with eyes Like those sparklers that peep out from summer-night skies At astronomers-royal , and laugh with delight To see elderly gentlemen spying all night . While her figure — oh ! bring all the gracefullest things That are borne thro ’ the light air by feet or by wings , Not a single new grace to that form could they teach , Which combines in itself the perfection of each ; While , rapid or slow , as her fairy feet fall , The mute music of symmetry modulates all . Ne'er in short was there creature more formed to bewilder A gay youth like me , who of castles aërial ( And only of such ) am , God help me ! a builder ; Still peopling each mansion with lodgers ethereal , And now , to this nymph of the seraph-like eye , Letting out , as you see , my first floor next the sky . But , alas ! nothing 's perfect on earth — even she , This divine little gipsy , does odd things sometimes ; Talks learning — looks wise ( rather painful to see ) , Prints already in two County papers her rhymes ; And raves — the sweet , charming , absurd little dear , About Amulets , Bijous , and Keepsakes , next year . In a manner which plainly bad symptoms portends Of that Annual blue fit , so distressing to friends ; A fit which , tho ’ lasting but one short edition , Leaves the patient long after in sad inanition . However , let 's hope for the best — and , meanwhile , Be it mine still to bask in the niece 's warm smile ; While you , if you 're wise , Dick , will play the gallant ( Uphill work , I confess ,) to her Saint of an Aunt . Think , my boy , for a youngster like you , who 've a lack , Not indeed of rupees , but of all other specie .

FROM MISS BIDDY FUDGE TO MRS. ELIZABETH ——. Just in time for the post , dear , and monstrously busy , With godly concernments — and worldly ones , too ; Things carnal and spiritual mixt , my dear Lizzy , In this little brain till , bewildered and dizzy , ‘ Twixt heaven and earth , I scarce know what I do . First , I 've been to see all the gay fashions from Town , Which our favorite Miss Gimp for the spring has had down . Sleeves still worn ( which I think is wise ) , à la folle , Charming hats , pou de soie — tho ’ the shape rather droll . But you can  t think how nicely the caps of tulle lace , With the mentonnières look on this poor sinful face ; And I mean , if the Lord in his mercy thinks right , To wear one at Mrs. Fitz-wigram 's to-night . The silks are quite heavenly :— I 'm glad too to say Gimp herself grows more godly and good every day ; Hath had sweet experience — yea , even doth begin To turn from the Gentiles , and put away sin — And all since her last stock of goods was laid in . What a blessing one 's milliner , careless of pelf , Should thus “ walk in newness , ” as well as one 's self ! So much for the blessings , the comforts of Spirit I 've had since we met , and they 're more than I merit !— Poor , sinful , weak creature in every respect , Tho ’ ordained ( God knows why ) to be one of the Elect . But now for the picture 's reverse .— You remember That footman and cook-maid I hired last December ; He a Baptist Particular — she , of some sect Not particular , I fancy , in any respect ; But desirous , poor thing , to be fed with the Word , And “ to wait , ” as she said , “ on Miss Fudge and the Lord . ” Well , my dear , of all men , that Particular Baptist At preaching a sermon , off hand , was the aptest ; And , long as he staid , do him justice , more rich in Sweet savors of doctrine , there never was kitchen . He preached in the parlor , he preached in the hall , He preached to the chambermaids , scullions and all . All heard with delight his reprovings of sin , But above all , the cook-maid :— oh , ne'er would she tire — Tho ’ , in learning to save sinful souls from the fire , She would oft let the soles she was frying fall in . ( God forgive me for punning on points thus of piety !— A sad trick I 've learned in Bob 's heathen society . ) But ah ! there remains still the worst of my tale ; Come , Asterisks , and help me the sad truth to veil — Conscious stars , that at even your own secret turn pale ! * * * * * In short , dear , this preaching and psalm-singing pair , Chosen “ vessels of mercy , ” as I thought they were , Have together this last week eloped ; making bold To whip off as much goods as both vessels could hold — Not forgetting some scores of sweet Tracts from my shelves , Two Family Bibles as large as themselves , And besides , from the drawer — I neglecting to lock it — My neat “ Morning Manna , done up for the pocket . "[ 1 ] Was there e'er known a case so distressing , dear Liz ? It has made me quite ill : - and the worst of it is , When rogues are all pious , ‘ tis hard to detect Which rogues are the reprobate , which the elect . This man “ had a call , ” he said — impudent mockery ! What call had he to my linen and crockery ? I 'm now and have been for this week past in chase Of some godly young couple this pair to replace . The enclosed two announcements have just met my eyes In that venerable Monthly where Saints advertise For such temporal comforts as this world supplies ; And the fruits of the Spirit are properly made An essential in every craft , calling and trade . Where the attorney requires for his ‘ prentice some youth Who has “ learned to fear God and to walk in the truth ; ” Where the sempstress , in search of employment , declares That pay is no object , so she can have prayers ; And the Establisht Wine Company proudly gives out That the whole of the firm , Co. and all , are devout . Happy London , one feels , as one reads o'er the pages , Where Saints are so much more abundant than sages ; Where Parsons may soon be all laid on the shelf , As each Cit can cite chapter and verse for himself , And the serious frequenters of market and dock All lay in religion as part of their stock .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Who can tell to what lengths we may go on improving , When thus thro ’ all London the Spirit keeps moving , And heaven 's so in vogue that each shop advertisement Is now not so much for the earth as the skies meant ? P. S. Have mislaid the two paragraphs — can  t stop to look , But both describe charming — both Footman and Cook . She , “ decidedly pious ” — with pathos deplores The increase of French cookery and sin on our shores ; And adds — ( while for further accounts she refers To a great Gospel preacher , a cousin of hers ,) That “ tho ’ some make their Sabbaths mere matter-of-fun days , She asks but for tea and the Gospel , on Sundays . ” The footman , too , full of the true saving knowledge ;— Has late been to Cambridge — to Trinity College ; Served last a young gentleman , studying divinity , But left — not approving the morals of Trinity . P. S. I enclose , too , according to promise , some scraps Of my Journal — that Day-book I keep of my heart ; Where , at some little items , ( partaking , perhaps , More of earth than of heaven ,) thy prudery may start , And suspect something tender , sly girl as thou art . For the present , I 'm mute — but , whate'er may befall , Recollect , dear , ( in Hebrews , xiii . 4 ,) St. Paul Hath himself declared , “ marriage is honorable in all . ” EXTRACTS FROM MY DIARY . Monday . Tried a new chälé gown on — pretty . No one to see me in it — pity ! Flew in a passion with Fritz , my maid ;— The Lord forgive me !— she lookt dismayed ; But got her to sing the 100th Psalm , While she curled my hair , which made me calm . Nothing so soothes a Christian heart As sacred music — heavenly art ! Tuesday At two a visit from Mr. Magan — A remarkably handsome , nice young man ; And , all Hibernian tho ’ he be , As civilized , strange to say , as we ! I own this young man 's spiritual state Hath much engrossed my thoughts of late ; And I mean , as soon as my niece is gone , To have some talk with him thereupon . At present I naught can do or say , But that troublesome child is in the way ; Nor is there , I think , a doubt that he Would also her absence much prefer , As oft , while listening intent to me , He 's forced , from politeness , to look at her . Heigho !— what a blessing should Mr. Magan Turn out , after all , a “ renewed ” young man ; And to me should fall the task , on earth , To assist at the dear youth 's second birth . Blest thought ! and ah ! more blest the tie , Were it Heaven 's high will , that he and I — But I blush to write the nuptial word — Should wed , as St. Paul says , “ in the Lord ” ; Not this world 's wedlock — gross , gallant , But pure — as when Amram married his aunt . Our ages differ — but who would count One 's natural sinful life 's amount , Or look in the Register 's vulgar page For a regular twice-born Christian 's age , Who , blessed privilege ! only then Begins to live when he 's born again ? And , counting in this way — let me see — I myself but five years old shall be . And dear Magan , when the event takes place , An actual new-born child of grace — Should Heaven in mercy so dispose — A six-foot baby , in swaddling clothes . Wednesday . Finding myself , by some good fate , With Mr. Magan left téte-à-téte , Had just begun — having stirred the fire , And drawn my chair near his — to inquire , What his notions were of Original Sin , When that naughty Fanny again bounced in ; And all the sweet things I had got to say Of the Flesh and the Devil were whiskt away ! Much grieved to observe that Mr. Magan Is actually pleased and , amused with Fan ! What charms any sensible man can see In a child so foolishly young as she — But just eighteen , come next Mayday , With eyes , like herself , full of naught but play — Is , I own , an exceeding puzzle to me .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ Morning Manna , or British Verse-book , neatly done up for the pocket , ” and chiefly intended to assist the members of the British Verse Association , whose design is , we are told , “ to induce the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland to commit one and the same verse of Scripture to memory every morning . Already , it is known , several thousand persons in Scotland , besides tens of thousands in America and Africa , are every morning learning the same verse . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>According to the late Mr. Irving , there is even a peculiar form of theology got up expressly for the money-market , “ I know how far wide , ” he says , “ of the mark my views of Christ 's work in the flesh will be viewed by those who are working with the stock-jobbing theology of the religious world . ” “ Let these preachers . ” he adds , “ ( for I will not call them theologians ) , cry up , brother like , their article , ” — Morning Watch . ” — No . iii , 442 . 443 . LETTER III . FROM MISS FANNY FUDGE , TO HER COUSIN , MISS KITTY ——. STANZAS ENCLOSED . TO MY SHADOW ; OR , WHY ?— WHAT ?— HOW ? Dark comrade of my path ! while earth and sky Thus wed their charms , in bridal light arrayed , Why in this bright hour , walkst thou ever nigh ; Blackening my footsteps , with thy length of shade — Dark comrade , WHY ? Thou mimic Shape that , mid these flowery scenes , Glidest beside me o'er each sunny spot , Saddening them as thou goest — say , what means So dark an adjunct to so bright a lot — Grim goblin , WHAT ? Still , as to pluck sweet flowers I bend my brow , Thou bendest , too — then risest when I rise ;— Say , mute , mysterious Thing ! how is't that thou Thus comest between me and those blessed skies — Dim shadow , HOW ? ( ADDITIONAL STANZA , BY ANOTHER HAND . ) Thus said I to that Shape , far less in grudge Than gloom of soul ; while , as I eager cried , Oh Why ? What ? How ?— a Voice , that one might judge To be some Irish echo 's , faint replied , Oh fudge , fudge , fudge ! You have here , dearest Coz , my last lyric effusion ; And , with it , that odious “ additional stanza , Which Aunt will insist I must keep , as conclusion , And which , you 'll at once see , is Mr. Magan 's ;— a Most cruel and dark-designed extravaganza , And part of that plot in which he and my Aunt are To stifle the flights of my genius by banter . Just so ‘ twas with Byron 's young eagle-eyed strain , Just so did they taunt him ;— but vain , critics , vain All your efforts to saddle Wit 's fire with a chain ! To blot out the splendor of Fancy 's young stream , Or crop , in its cradle , her newly-fledged beam !!! Thou perceivest , dear , that , even while these lines I indite , Thoughts burn , brilliant fancies break out , wrong or right , And I 'm all over poet , in Criticism 's spite ! That my Aunt , who deals only in Psalms , and regards Messrs. Sternhold and Co. as the first of all bards — That she should make light of my works I can  t blame ; But that nice , handsome , odious Magan — what a shame ! Do you know , dear , that , high as on most points I rate him , I 'm really afraid — after all , I — must hate him , He is so provoking — naught 's safe from his tongue ; He spares no one authoress , ancient or young . Were you Sappho herself , and in Keepsake or Bijou Once shone as contributor , Lord ! how he 'd quiz you ! He laughs at all Monthlies — I 've actually seen A sneer on his brow at The Court Magazine !— While of Weeklies , poor things , there 's but one he peruses , And buys every book which that Weekly abuses . But I care not how others such sarcasm may fear , One spirit , at least , will not bend to his sneer ; And tho ’ tried by the fire , my young genius shall burn as Uninjured as crucified gold in the furnace ! ( I suspect the word “ crucified ” must be made “ crucible , ” Before this fine image of mine is producible . ) And now , dear — to tell you a secret which , pray Only trust to such friends as with safety you may — You know and indeed the whole country suspects ( Tho ’ the Editor often my best things rejects ) , That the verses signed so , [ symbol : hand ] , which you now and then see In our County Gazette ( vide last ) are by me . But ‘ tis dreadful to think what provoking mistakes The vile country Press in one 's prosody makes . For you know , dear — I may , without vanity , hint — Tho ’ an angel should write , still ‘ tis devils must print ; And you can  t think what havoc these demons sometimes Choose to make of one 's sense , and what 's worse , of one 's rhymes . But a week or two since , in my Ode upon Spring , Which I meant to have made a most beautiful thing , Where I talkt of the “ dewdrops from freshly-blown roses , ” The nasty things made it “ from freshly-blown noses ! ” And once when to please my cross Aunt , I had tried To commemorate some saint of her cligue , who 'd just died , Having said he “ had taken up in heaven his position , ” They made it , he 'd “ taken up to heaven his physician ! ” This is very disheartening ;— but brighter days shine , I rejoice , love , to say both for me and the Nine ; For what do you think ?— so delightful ! next year , Oh , prepare , dearest girl , for the grand news prepare — I 'm to write in “ The Keepsake ” — yes , Kitty , my dear . To write in “ The Keepsake , ” as sure as you 're there !! T ’ other night , at a Ball , ‘ twas my fortunate chance With a very nice elderly Dandy to dance , Who , ‘ twas plain , from some hints which I now and then caught . Was the author of something — one couldn  t tell what ; But his satisfied manner left no room to doubt It was something that Colburn had lately brought out . We conversed of belles-lettres thro ’ all the quadrille ,— Of poetry , dancing , of prose , standing still ; Talkt of Intellect 's march — whether right ‘ twas or wrong — And then settled the point in a bold en avant . In the course of this talk ‘ twas that , having just hinted That I too had Poems which — longed to be printed , He protested , kind man ! he had seen , at first sight , I was actually born in “ The Keepsake ” to write . “ In the Annals of England let some , ” he said , “ shine , “ But a place in her Annuals , Lady , be thine ! “ Even now future ‘ Keepsakes ’ seem brightly to rise , “ Thro ’ the vista of years , as I gaze on those eyes ,— “ All lettered and prest , and of large-paper size ! ” How unlike that Magan , who my genius would smother , And how we true geniuses find out each other ! This and much more he said with that fine frenzied glance One so rarely now sees , as we slid thro ’ the dance ; Till between us ‘ twas finally fixt that , next year , In this exquisite task I my pen should engage ; And , at parting , he stoopt down and lispt in my ear These mystical words , which I could but just hear , “ Terms for rhyme — if it 's prime — ten and sixpence per page . ” Think , Kitty , my dear , if I heard his words right , What a mint of half-guineas this small head contains ; If for nothing to write is itself a delight , Ye Gods , what a bliss to be paid for one 's strains ! Having dropt the dear fellow a courtesy profound , Off at once , to inquire all about him , I ran ; And from what I could learn , do you know , dear , I 've found That he 's quite a new species of literary man ; One , whose task is — to what will not fashion accustom us ?— To edit live authors , as if they were posthumous . For instance — the plan , to be sure , is the oddest !— If any young he or she author feels modest In venturing abroad , this kind gentleman-usher Lends promptly a hand to the interesting blusher ; Indites a smooth Preface , brings merit to light , Which else might , by accident , shrink out of sight , And , in short , renders readers and critics polite . My Aunt says — tho ’ scarce on such points one can credit her — He was Lady Jane Thingumbob 's last novel 's editor . ‘ Tis certain the fashion 's but newly invented ; And quick as the change of all things and all names is , Who knows but as authors like girls are presented , We girls may be edited soon at St. James 's ? I must now close my letter — there 's Aunt , in full screech , Wants to take me to hear some great Irvingite preach . God forgive me , I 'm not much inclined , I must say , To go and sit still to be preached at to-day . And besides — ‘ twill be all against dancing , no doubt , Which my poor Aunt abhors with such hatred devout , That so far from presenting young nymphs with a head , For their skill in the dance , as of Herod is said , She 'd wish their own heads in the platter instead . There again — coming , Ma'am !— I 'll write more , if I can , Before the post goes , Your affectionate Fan . Four o'clock . Such a sermon !— tho ’ not about dancing , my dear ; ‘ Twas only on the end of the world being near . Eighteen Hundred and Forty 's the year that some state As the time for that accident — some Forty Eight<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>And I own , of the two , I 'd prefer much the latter , As then I shall be an old maid , and ‘ two n't matter .

He comes from Erin 's speechful shore Like fervid kettle , bubbling o'er With hot effusions — hot and weak ; Sound , Humbug , all your hollowest drums , He comes , of Erin 's martyrdoms To Britain 's well-fed Church to speak . Puff him , ye Journals of the Lord ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Twin prosers , Watchman and Record ! Journals reserved for realms of bliss , Being much too good to sell in this , Prepare , ye wealthier Saints , your dinners , Ye Spinsters , spread your tea and crumpets ; And you , ye countless Tracts for Sinners , Blow all your little penny trumpets . He comes , the reverend man , to tell To all who still the Church 's part take , Tales of parsonic woe , that well Might make even grim Dissenter 's heart ache :— Of ten whole bishops snatched away For ever from the light of day ; ( With God knows , too , how many more , For whom that doom is yet in store ) — Of Rectors cruelly compelled From Bath and Cheltenham to haste home , Because the tithes , by Pat withheld , Will not to Bath or Cheltenham come ; Nor will the flocks consent to pay Their parsons thus to stay away ;— Tho ’ with such parsons , one may doubt If ‘ tis n't money well laid out ;— Of all , in short , and each degree Of that once happy Hierarchy , Which used to roll in wealth so pleasantly ; But now , alas ! is doomed to see Its surplus brought to nonplus presently ! Such are the themes this man of pathos , Priest of prose and lord of bathos , Will preach and preach t'ye , till you 're dull again ; Then , hail him , Saints , with joint acclaim , Shout to the stars his tuneful name , Which Murtagh was , ere known to fame , But now is Mortimer O'Mulligan ! All true , Dick , true as you 're alive — I 've seen him , some hours since , arrive . Murtagh is come , the great Itinerant — And Tuesday , in the market-place , Intends , to every saint and sinner i n't , To state what he calls Ireland 's Case ; Meaning thereby the case of his shop , -  Of curate , vicar , rector , bishop , And all those other grades seraphic , That make men 's souls their special traffic , Tho ’ caring not a pin which way The erratic souls go , so they pay .— Just as some roguish country nurse , Who takes a foundling babe to suckle , First pops the payment in her purse , Then leaves poor dear to — suck its knuckle : Even so these reverend rigmaroles Pocket the money — starve the souls . Murtagh , however , in his glory , Will tell , next week , a different story ; Will make out all these men of barter , As each a saint , a downright martyr , Brought to the stake — i. e . a beef one , Of all their martyrdoms the chief one ; Tho ’ try them even at this , they 'll bear it , If tender and washt down with claret . Meanwhile Miss Fudge , who loves all lions . Your saintly , next to great and high ‘ uns — ( A Viscount , be he what he may , Would cut a Saint out any day ,) Has just announced a godly rout , Where Murtagh 's to be first brought out , And shown in his tame , week-day state :— “ Prayers , half-past seven , tea at eight . ” Even so the circular missive orders — Pink cards , with cherubs round the borders . Haste , Dick — you 're lost , if you lose time ;— Spinsters at forty-five grow giddy , And Murtagh with his tropes sublime Will surely carry off old Biddy , Unless some spark at once propose , And distance him by downright prose . That sick , rich squire , whose wealth and lands All pass , they say , to Biddy 's hands , ( The patron , Dick , of three fat rectories ! ) Is dying of angina pectoris ;— So that , unless you 're stirring soon . Murtagh , that priest of puff and pelf , May come in for a honey-moon , And be the man of it , himself ! As for me , Dick — ‘ tis whim , ‘ tis folly , But this young niece absorbs me wholly . ‘ Tis true , the girl 's a vile verse-maker — Would rhyme all nature , if you 'd let her ;— But even her oddities , plague take her , But made me love her all the better . Too true it is , she 's bitten sadly With this new rage for rhyming badly , Which late hath seized all ranks and classes , Down to that new Estate , “ the masses “ ; Till one pursuit all tastes combines — One common railroad o'er Parnassus , Where , sliding in those tuneful grooves , Called couplets , all creation moves , And the whole world runs mad in lines . Add to all this — what 's even still worse , As rhyme itself , tho ’ still a curse , Sounds better to a chinking purse — Scarce sixpence hath my charmer got , While I can muster just a groat ; So that , computing self and Venus , Tenpence would clear the amount between us . However , things may yet prove better :— Meantime , what awful length of letter ! And how , while heaping thus with gibes The Pegasus of modern scribes , My own small hobby of farrago Hath beat the pace at which even they go !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ Our anxious desire is to be found on the side of the Lord . ” — Record Newspaper . LETTER V. FROM LARRY O'BRANIGAN , IN ENGLAND , TO HIS WIFE JUDY , AT MULLINAFAD . Dear Judy , I sind you this bit of a letther , By mail-coach conveyance — for want of a betther — To tell you what luck in this world I have had Since I left the sweet cabin , at Mullinafad . Och , Judy , that night !— when the pig which we meant To dry-nurse in the parlor , to pay off the rent , Julianna , the craythur — that name was the death of her —<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Gave us the shlip and we saw the last breath of her ! And there were the childher , six innocent sowls , For their nate little play-fellow turning up howls ; While yourself , my dear Judy ( tho ’ grievin 's a folly ) , Stud over Julianna 's remains , melancholy — Cryin ’ , half for the craythur and half for the money , “ Arrah , why did ye die till we 'd sowled you , my honey ? ” But God 's will be done !— and then , faith , sure enough , As the pig was desaiced , ‘ twas high time to be off . So we gothered up all the poor duds we could catch , Lock the owld cabin-door , put the kay in the thatch , Then tuk laave of each other 's sweet lips in the dark , And set off , like the Chrishtians turned out of the Ark ; The six childher with you , my dear Judy , ochone ! And poor I wid myself , left condolin ’ alone . How I came to this England , o'er say and o'er lands , And what cruel hard walkin ’ I 've had on my hands , Is , at this present writin ’ , too tadious to speak , So I 'll mintion it all in a postscript , next week :— Only starved I was , surely , as thin as a lath , Till I came to an up-and-down place they call Bath , Where , as luck was , I managed to make a meal 's meat , By dhraggin ’ owld ladies all day thro ’ the street — Which their docthors ( who pocket , like fun , the pound starlins ,) Have brought into fashion to plase the owld darlins . Divil a boy in all Bath , tho ’ I say it , could carry The grannies up hill half so handy as Larry ; And the higher they lived , like owld crows , in the air , The more I was wanted to lug them up there . But luck has two handles , dear Judy , they say , And mine has both handles put on the wrong way . For , pondherin ’ , one morn , on a drame I 'd just had Of yourself and the babbies , at Mullinafad , Och , there came o'er my sinses so plasin ’ a flutther , That I spilt an owld Countess right clane in the gutther , Muff , feathers and all !— the descint was most awful , And — what was still worse , faith — I knew'twas unlawful : For , tho ’ , with mere women , no very great evil , ‘ Tupset an owld Countess in Bath is the divil ! So , liftin ’ the chair , with herself safe upon it , ( for nothin ’ about her — was kilt , but her bonnet ,) Without even mentionin ’ “ By your lave , ma'am , ” I tuk to my heels and — here , Judy , I am ! What 's the name of this town I can n't say very well , But your heart sure will jump when you hear what befell Your own beautiful Larry , the very first day , ( And a Sunday it was , shinin ’ out mighty gay ,) When his brogues to this city of luck found their way . Bein ’ hungry , God help me and happenin ’ to stop , Just to dine on the shmell of a pasthry-cook 's shop , I saw , in the window , a large printed paper . And read there a name , och ! that made my heart caper — Though printed it was in some quare ABC , That might bother a schoolmaster , let alone me . By gor , you 'd have laughed Judy , could you 've but listened , As , doubtin ’ , I cried , “ why is it !— no , it is n't : ” But it was , after all — for , by spellin ’ quite slow , First I made out “ Rev . Mortimer ” — then a great “ O ” ; And , at last , by hard readin ’ and rackin ’ my skull again , Out it came , nate as imported , “ O'Mulligan ! ” Up I jumpt like a sky-lark , my jewel , at that name ,— Divil a doubt on my mind , but it must be the same “ Master Murthagh , himself , ” says I , “ all the world over ! My own fosther-brother — by jinks , I 'm in clover . Tho ’ there , in the play-bill , he figures so grand , One wet-nurse it was brought us both up by hand , And he 'll not let me shtarve in the inemy 's land ! ” Well , to make a long hishtory short , niver doubt But I managed , in no time , to find the lad out : And the joy of the meetin ’ bethuxt him and me , Such a pair of owld cumrogues — was charmin ’ to see . Nor is Murthagh less plased with the evint than I am , As he just then was wanting a Valley-de-sham ; And , for dressin ’ a gintleman , one way or t'other , Your nate Irish lad is beyant every other . But now , Judy , comes the quare part of the case ; And , in throth , it 's the only drawback on my place . ‘ Twas Murthagh 's ill luck to be crost , as you know , With an awkward mishfortune some short time ago ; That 's to say , he turned Protestant — why , I can'tlarn ; But , of coorse , he knew best , an ’ it 's not my consarn . All I know is , we both were good Catholics , at nurse , And myself am so still — nayther better not worse . Well , our bargain was all right and tight in a jiffy , And lads more contint never yet left , the Liffey , When Murthagh — or Morthimer , as he 's now chrishened , His name being convarted , at laist , if he is n't — Lookin ’ sly at me ( faith , ‘ twas divartin ’ to see ) “ Of coorse , you 're a Protestant , Larry , ” says he . Upon which says myself , wid a wink just as shly , “ Is't a Protestant ?— oh yes , I am , sir , ” says I ;— And there the chat ended , and divil a more word Controvarsial between us has since then occurred . What Murthagh could mane , and , in troth , Judy dear , What I myself meant , doesn'tseem mighty clear ; But the truth is , tho ’ still for the Owld Light a stickler , I was just then too shtarved to be over partic'lar :— And , God knows , between us , a comic'ler pair Of twin Protestants could n't be seen any where . Next Tuesday ( as towld in the play-bills I mintioned , Addrest to the loyal and godly intintioned ,) His Riverence , my master , comes forward to preach ,— Myself doesn'tknow whether sarmon or speech , But it 's all one to him , he 's a dead hand at each ; Like us Paddys in gin'ral , whose skill in orations Quite bothers the blarney of all other nations . But , whisht !— there 's his Riverence , shoutin ’ out “ Larry , ” And sorra a word more will this shmall paper carry ; So , here , Judy , ends my short bit of a letther , Which , faix , I 'd have made a much bigger and betther . But divil a one Post-office hole in this town Fit to swallow a dacent sized billy-dux down . So good luck to the childer !— tell Molly , I love her ; Kiss Oonagh 's sweet mouth , and kiss Katty all over — Not forgettin ’ the mark of the red-currant whiskey She got at the fair when yourself was so frisky .

How I grieve you 're not with us !— pray , come , if you can , Ere we 're robbed of this dear , oratorical man , Who combines in himself all the multiple glory Of , Orangeman , Saint , quondam Papist and Tory ;— ( Choice mixture ! like that from which , duly confounded , The best sort of brass was , in old times , compounded . ) — The sly and the saintly , the worldly and godly , All fused down , in brogue so deliciously oddly ! In short , he 's a dear — and such audiences draws , Such loud peals of laughter and shouts of applause , As can n't but do good to the Protestant cause . Poor dear Irish Church !— he today sketched a view Of her history and prospect , to me at least new , And which ( if it takes as it ought ) must arouse The whole Christian world her just rights to espouse . As to reasoning — you know , dear , that 's now of no use , People still will their facts and dry figures produce , As if saving the souls of a Protestant flock were A thing to be managed “ according to Cocker ! ” In vain do we say , ( when rude radicals hector At paying some thousands a year to a Rector , In places where Protestants never yet were ,) “ Who knows but young Protestants may be born there ? ” And granting such accident , think , what a shame , If they didn  t find Rector and Clerk when they came ! It is clear that , without such a staff on full pay , These little Church embryos must go astray ; And , while fools are computing what Parsons would cost , Precious souls are meanwhile to the Establishment lost ! In vain do we put the case sensibly thus ;— They 'll still with their figures and facts make a fuss , And ask “ if , while all , choosing each his own road , Journey on , as we can , towards the Heavenly Abode , It is right that seven eighths of the travellers should pay For one eighth that goes quite a different way ? ” — Just as if , foolish people , this was n't , in reality , A proof of the Church 's extreme liberality , That tho ’ hating Popery in other respects , She to Catholic money in no way objects ; And so liberal her very best Saints , in this sense , That they even go to heaven at the Catholic 's expense . But tho ’ clear to our minds all these arguments be , People cannot or will not their cogency see ; And I grieve to confess , did the poor Irish Church Stand on reasoning alone , she 'd be left in the lurch . It was therefore , dear Lizzy , with joy most sincere , That I heard this nice Reverend O'something we 've here , Produce , from the depths of his knowledge and reading , A view of that marvellous Church , far exceeding , In novelty , force , and profoundness of thought , All that Irving himself in his glory e'er taught . Looking thro ’ the whole history , present and past , Of the Irish Law Church , from the first to the last ; Considering how strange its original birth — Such a thing having never before been on earth — How opposed to the instinct , the law and the force Of nature and reason has been its whole course ; Thro ’ centuries encountering repugnance , resistance , Scorn , hate , execration — yet still in existence ! Considering all this , the conclusion he draws Is that Nature exempts this one Church from her laws — That Reason , dumb-foundered , gives up the dispute , And before the portentous anomaly stands mute ; That in short ‘ tis a Miracle ! and , once begun , And transmitted thro ’ ages , from father to son , For the honor of miracles , ought to go on . Never yet was conclusion so cogent and sound , Or so fitted the Church 's weak foes to confound . For observe the more low all her merits they place , The more they make out the miraculous case , And the more all good Christians must deem it profane To disturb such a prodigy 's marvellous reign . As for scriptural proofs , he quite placed beyond doubt That the whole in the Apocalypse may be found out , As clear and well-proved , he would venture to swear , As anything else has been ever found there :— While the mode in which , bless the dear fellow , he deals With that whole lot of vials and trumpets and seals , And the ease with which vial on vial he strings , Shows him quite a first-rate at all these sort of things . So much for theology :— as for the affairs Of this temporal world — the light drawing-room cares And gay toils of the toilet , which , God knows , I seek , From no love of such things , but in humbleness meek , And to be , as the Apostle , was , “ weak with the weak , ” Thou wilt find quite enough ( till I 'm somewhat less busy ) In the extracts inclosed , my dear news-loving Lizzy . EXTRACTS FROM MY DIARY . Thursday . Last night , having naught more holy to do , Wrote a letter to dear Sir Andrew Agnew , About the “ Do-nothing-on-Sunday-club , ” Which we wish by some shorter name to dub :— As the use of more vowels and Consonants Than a Christian on Sunday really wants , Is a grievance that ought to be done away , And the Alphabet left to rest , that day . Sunday . Sir Andrew 's answer !— but , shocking to say , Being franked unthinkingly yesterday . To the horror of Agnews yet unborn , It arrived on this blessed Sunday morn ! !— How shocking !— the postman 's self cried “ shame o n't , ” Seeing the immaculate Andrew 's name o n't !! What will the Club do ?— meet , no doubt . ‘ Tis a matter that touches the Class Devout , And the friends of the Sabbath must speak out . Tuesday . Saw to-day , at the raffle — and saw it with pain — That those stylish Fitzwigrams begin to dress plain . Even gay little Sophy smart trimmings renounces — She who long has stood by me thro ’ all sorts of flounces , And showed by upholding the toilet 's sweet rites , That we girls may be Christians without being frights . This , I own , much alarms me ; for tho ’ one 's religious , And strict and — all that , there 's no need to be hideous ; And why a nice bonnet should stand in the way Of one 's going to heaven , ‘ tis n't easy to say . Then , there 's Gimp , the poor thing — if her custom we drop , Pray what 's to become of her soul and her shop ? If by saints like ourselves no more orders are given , She 'll lose all the interest she now takes in heaven ; And this nice little “ fire-brand , pluckt from the burning , ” May fall in again at the very next turning . Wednesday . Mem .— To write to the India Mission Society ; And send £ 20 — heavy tax upon piety ! Of all Indian luxuries we now-a-days boast , Making “ Company 's Christians ” perhaps costs the most . And the worst of it is , that these converts full grown , Having lived in our faith mostly die in their own ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Praying hard , at the last , to some god who , they say , When incarnate on earth , used to steal curds and whey .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>Think , how horrid , my dear !— so that all 's thrown away ; And ( what is still worse ) for the rum and the rice They consumed , while believers , we saints pay the price . Still ‘ tis cheering to find that we do save a few — The Report gives six Christians for Cunnangcadoo ; Doorkotchum reckons seven , and four Trevandrum , While but one and a half 's left at Cooroopadum . In this last-mentioned place ‘ tis the barbers enslave ‘ em , For once they turn Christians no barber will shave ‘ em .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>To atone for this rather small Heathen amount , Some Papists , turned Christians ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>are tackt to the account . And tho ’ to catch Papists , one need n't go so far , Such fish are worth hooking , wherever they are ; And now , when so great of such converts the lack is , One Papist well caught is worth millions of Blackies . Friday . Last night had a dream so odd and funny , I cannot resist recording it here .— Methought that the Genius of Matrimony Before me stood with a joyous leer , Leading a husband in each hand , And both for me , which lookt rather queer ;— One I could perfectly understand , But why there were two wasn  t quite so clear . T'was meant however , I soon could see , To afford me a choice — a most excellent plan ; And — who should this brace of candidates be , But Messrs. O'Mulligan and Magan :— A thing , I suppose , unheard of till then , To dream , at once , of two Irishmen !— That handsome Magan , too , with wings on his shoulders ( For all this past in the realms of the Blest . ) And quite a creature to dazzle beholders ; While even O'Mulligan , feathered and drest As an elderly cherub , was looking his best . Ah Liz , you , who know me , scarce can doubt As to which of the two I singled out . But — awful to tell — when , all in dread Of losing so bright a vision 's charms , I graspt at Magan , his image fled , Like a mist , away , and I found but the head Of O'Mulligan , wings and all , in my arms ! The Angel had flown to some nest divine . And the elderly Cherub alone was mine ! Heigho !— it is certain that foolish Magan Either can'tor won  t see that he might be the man ; And , perhaps , dear — who knows ?— if naught better befall But — O'Mulligan may be the man , after all . N. B . Next week mean to have my first scriptural rout , For the special discussion of matters devout ;— Like those soirées , at Powerscourt , so justly renowned , For the zeal with which doctrine and negus went round ; Those theology-routs which the pious Lord Roden , That pink of Christianity , first set the mode in ; Where , blessed down-pouring<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>from tea until nine , The subjects lay all in the Prophecy line ;— Then , supper — and then , if for topics hard driven , From thence until bed-time to Satan was given ; While Roden , deep read in each topic and tome , On all subjects ( especially the last ) was at home .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Of such relapses we find innumerable instances in the accounts of the Missionaries .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The god Krishna , one of the incarnations of the god Vishnu . “ One day [ says the Bhagavata ] Krishna 's playfellows complained to Tasuda that he had pilfered and ate their curds . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>“ Roteen wants shaving ; but the barber here will not do it .

Bring me the slumbering souls of flowers , While yet , beneath some northern sky , Ungilt by beams , ungemmed by showers , They wait the breath of summer hours , To wake to light each diamond eye , And let loose every florid sigh ! Bring me the first-born ocean waves , From out those deep primeval caves , Where from the dawn of Time they 've lain — THE EMBRYOS OF A FUTURE MAIN !— Untaught as yet , young things , to speak The language of their PARENT SEA ( Polyphlysbaean named , in Greek ) , Tho ’ soon , too soon , in bay and creek , Round startled isle and wondering peak , They 'll thunder loud and long as HE ! Bring me , from Hecla 's iced abode , Young fires — I had got , dear , thus far in my ODE Intending to fill the whole page to the bottom , But , having invoked such a lot of fine things , Flowers , billows and thunderbolts , rainbows and wings , Didn  t know what to do with ‘ em , when I had got ‘ em . The truth is , my thoughts are too full , at this minute , Of Past MSS . any new ones to try . This very night 's coach brings my destiny in it — Decides the great question , to live or to die ! And , whether I 'm henceforth immortal or no , All depends on the answer of Simpkins and Co .! You 'll think , love , I rave , so ‘ tis best to let out The whole secret , at once — I have publisht a book !!! Yes , an actual Book :— if the marvel you doubt , You have only in last Monday 's Courier to look , And you 'll find “ This day publisht by Simpkins and Co. A Romaunt , in twelve Cantos , entitled ‘ Woe Woe ! ’ By Miss Fanny F ——, known more commonly so [ symbol : hand ] . ” This I put that my friends may n't be left in the dark But may guess at my writing by knowing my mark . How I managed , at last , this great deed to achieve , Is itself a “ Romaunt ” which you 'd scarce , dear believe ; Nor can I just now , being all in a whirl , Looking out for the Magnet ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>explain it , dear girl . Suffice it to say , that one half the expense Of this leasehold of fame for long centuries hence — ( Tho ’ “ God knows , ” as aunt says my humble ambition Aspires not beyond a small Second Edition ) — One half the whole cost of the paper and printing , I 've managed , to scrape up , this year past , by stinting My own little wants in gloves , ribands , and shoes , Thus defrauding the toilet to fit out the Muse ! And who , my dear Kitty ; would not do the same ? What 's eau de Cologne to the sweet breath of fame ? Yards of riband soon end — but the measures of rhyme , Dipt in hues of the rainbow , stretch out thro ’ all time . Gloves languish and fade away pair after pair , While couplets shine out , but the brighter for wear , And the dancing-shoe 's gloss in an evening is gone , While light-footed lyrics thro ’ ages trip on . The remaining expense , trouble , risk — and , alas ! My poor copyright too — into other hands pass ; And my friend , the Head Devil of the “ County Gazette ” ( The only Mecaenas I 've ever had yet ) , He who set up in type my first juvenile lays , Is now see up by them for the rest of his days ; And while Gods ( as my “ Heathen Mythology ” says ) Live on naught but ambrosia , his lot how much sweeter To live , lucky devil , on a young lady 's metre ! As for puffing — that first of all literary boons , And essential alike both to bards and balloons , As , unless well supplied with inflation , ‘ tis found Neither bards nor balloons budge an inch from the ground ;— In this respect , naught could more prosperous befall ; As my friend ( for no less this kind imp can I call ) Knows the whole would of critics — the hypers and all . I suspect he himself , indeed , dabbles in rhyme , Which , for imps diabolic , is not the first time ; As I 've heard uncle Bob say , ‘ twas known among Gnostics , That the Devil on Two Sticks was a devil at Acrostics . But hark ! there 's the Magnet just dasht in from Town — How my heart , Kitty , beats ! I shall surely drop down . That awful Court Journal , Gazette Athenaeum , All full of my book — I shall sink when I see ‘ em . And then the great point — whether Simpkins and Co. Are actually pleased with their bargain or no !— Five o'clock . All 's delightful — such praises !— I really fear That this poor little head will turn giddy , my dear , I 've but time now to send you two exquisite scraps — All the rest by the Magnet , on Monday , perhaps . FROM THE “ MORNING POST . ” ‘ Tis known that a certain distinguisht physician Prescribes , for dyspepsia , a course of light reading ; And Rhymes by young Ladies , the first , fresh edition ( Ere critics have injured their powers of nutrition ,) Are he thinks , for weak stomachs , the best sort of feeding . Satires irritate — love-songs are found calorific ; But smooth , female sonnets he deems a specific , And , if taken at bedtime , a sure soporific . Among works of this kind , the most pleasing we know , Is a volume just published by Simpkins and Co ., Where all such ingredients — the flowery , the sweet , And the gently narcotic — are mixt per receipt , With a hand so judicious , we 've no hesitation To say that — ‘ bove all , for the young generation — ‘ Tis an elegant , soothing and safe preparation . Nota bene — for readers , whose object 's to sleep , And who read , in their nightcaps , the publishers keep Good fire-proof binding , which comes very cheap . ANECDOTE — FROM THE “ COURT JOURNAL . ” T ’ other night , at the Countess of ***' s rout , An amusing event was much whispered about . It was said that Lord — -  , at the Council , that day , Had , move than once , jumpt from his seat , like a rocket , And flown to a corner , where — heedless , they say , How the country 's resources were squandered away — He kept reading some papers he 'd brought in his pocket . Some thought them despatches from Spain or the Turk , Others swore they brought word we had lost the Mauritius ; But it turned out ‘ twas only Miss Fudge 's new work , Which his Lordship devoured with such zeal expeditious — Messrs. Simpkins and Co ., to avoid all delay , Having sent it in sheets , that his Lordship might say , He had distanced the whole reading world by a day !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>A day-coach of that name . LETTER VIII . FROM BOB FUDGE , ESQ ., TO THE REV . MORTIMER O'MULLIGAN . Tuesday evening , I much regret , dear Reverend Sir , I could not come to * * * to meet you ; But this curst gout won  t let me stir — Even now I but by proxy greet you ; As this vile scrawl , whate'er its sense is , Owes all to an amanuensis . Most other scourges of disease Reduce men to extremities — But gout won  t leave one even these . From all my sister writes , I see That you and I will quite agree . I 'm a plain man who speak the truth , And trust you 'll think me not uncivil , When I declare that from my youth I 've wisht your country at the devil : Nor can I doubt indeed from all I 've heard of your high patriot fame — From every word your lips let fall — That you most truly wish the same . It plagues one 's life out — thirty years Have I had dinning in my ears , “ Ireland wants this and that and t'other , ” And to this hour one nothing hears But the same vile , eternal bother . While , of those countless things she wanted , Thank God , but little has been granted , And even that little , if we 're men And Britons , we 'll have back again ! I really think that Catholic question Was what brought on my indigestion ; And still each year , as Popery 's curse Has gathered round us , I 've got worse ; Till even my pint of port a day Can  t keep the Pope and bile away . And whereas , till the Catholic bill , I never wanted draught or pill , The settling of that cursed question Has quite unsettled my digestion . Look what has happened since — the Elect Of all the bores of every sect , The chosen triers of men 's patience , From all the Three Denominations . Let loose upon us ;— even Quakers Turned into speechers and lawmakers , Who 'll move no question , stiff-rumpt elves , Till first the Spirit moves themselves ; And whose shrill Yeas and Nays , in chorus , Conquering our Ayes and Noes sonorous , Will soon to death 's own slumber snore us . Then , too , those Jews !— I really sicken To think of such abomination ; Fellows , who won  t eat ham with chicken , To legislate for this great nation !— Depend upo n't , when once they 've sway , With rich old Goldsmid at the head o ’ them , The Excise laws will be done away , And Circumcise ones past instead o ’ them ! In short , dear sir , look where one will , Things all go on so devilish ill , That , ‘ pon my soul , I rather fear Our reverend Rector may be right , Who tells me the Millennium 's near ; Nay , swears he knows the very year , And regulates his leases by ‘ t ;— Meaning their terms should end , no doubt , Before the world 's own lease is out . He thinks too that the whole thing 's ended So much more soon than was intended , Purely to scourge those men of sin Who brought the accurst Reform Bill in . However , let 's not yet despair ; Tho ’ Toryism 's eclipst , at present . And — like myself , in this old chair — Sits in a state by no means pleasant ; Feet crippled — hands , in luckless hour , Disabled of their grasping power ; And all that rampant glee , which revelled In this world 's sweets , be-dulled , be-deviled — Yet , tho ’ condemned to frisk no more , And both in Chair of Penance set , There 's something tells me , all 's not o'er With Toryism or Bobby yet ; That tho ’ , between us , I allow We 've not a leg to stand on now ; Tho ’ curst Reform and colchicum Have made us both look deuced glum , Yet still , in spite of Grote and Gout , Again we 'll shine triumphant out ! Yes — back again shall come , egad , Our turn for sport , my reverend lad . And then , O'Mulligan — oh then , When mounted on our nags again , You , on your high-flown Rosinante , Bedizened out , like Show-Gallantee ( Glitter great from substance scanty ) ;— While I , Bob Fudge , Esquire , shall ride Your faithful Sancho , by your side ; Then — talk of tilts and tournaments ! Dam'me , we 'll — ‘ Squire Fudge 's clerk presents To Reverend Sir his compliments ; Is grieved to say an accident Has just occurred which will prevent The Squire — tho ’ now a little better — From finishing this present letter . Just when he 'd got to “ Dam'me , we 'll ” — His Honor , full of martial zeal , Graspt at his crutch , but not being able To keep his balance or his hold , Tumbled , both self and crutch , and rolled , Like ball and bat , beneath the table . All 's safe — the table , chair and crutch ;— Nothing , thank God , is broken much , But the Squire 's head , which in the fall Got bumped considerably — that 's all . At this no great alarm we feel , As the Squire 's head can bear a deal . Wednesday morning Squire much the same — head rather light — Raved about “ Barbers ’ Wigs ” all night . Our housekeeper , old Mrs. Griggs , Suspects that he meant “ barbarous Whigs . ” LETTER IX . FROM LARRY O'BRANIGAN , TO HIS WIFE JUDY . As it was but last week that I sint you a letther , You 'll wondher , dear Judy , what this is about ; And , throth , it 's a letther myself would like betther , Could I manage to lave the contints of it out ; For sure , if it makes even me onaisy , Who takes things quiet , ‘ twill dhrive you crazy .

Arrah , sure , if I 'd heerd where he last showed his phiz , I 'd have known what a quare sort of monsthsr he is ; For , by gor , ‘ twas at Exether Change , sure enough , That himself and his other wild Irish showed off ; And it 's pity , so ‘ tis , that they had n't got no man Who knew the wild crathurs to act as their showman — Sayin ’ , “ Ladies and Gintlemen , plaze to take notice , “ How shlim and how shleek this black animal 's coat is ; “ All by raison , we 're towld , that the natur o ’ the baste “ Is to change its coat once in its lifetime , at laste ; “ And such objiks , in our counthry , not bein ’ common ones , “ Are bought up , as this was , by way of Fine Nomenons . “ In regard of its name — why , in throth , I 'm consarned “ To differ on this point so much with the Larned , “ Who call it a ‘ Morthimer , ’ whereas the craythur “ Is plainly a ‘ Murthagh , ’ by name and by nathur . ” This is how I 'd have towld them the righst of it all .

When axed how he daared , by tongue or by pen , To belie , in this way , seven millions of men , Faith , he said'twas all towld him by Docthor Den !<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>“ And who the divil 's he ? ” was the question that flew From Chrishtian to Chrishtian — but not a sowl knew . While on went Murthagh , in iligant style , Blasphaming us Cath'lics all the while , As a pack of desaivers , parjurers , villains , All the whole kit of the aforesaid millions ;— Yourself , dear Judy , as well as the rest , And the innocent craythur that 's at your breast , All rogues together , in word and deed , Owld Den our insthructor and Sin our creed ! When axed for his proofs again and again , Divil an answer he 'd give but Docthor Den . Couldn'the call into coort some livin ’ men ? “ No , thank you ” — he 'd stick to Docthor Den — An ould gintleman dead a century or two , Who all about us , live Catholics , knew ; And of coorse was more handy , to call in a hurry , Than Docthor MacHale or Docthor Murray ! But , throth , it 's no case to be jokin ’ upon , Tho ’ myself , from bad habits , is makin ’ it one . Even you , had you witnessed his grand climactherics , Which actially threw one owld maid in hysterics — Or , och ! had you heerd such a purty remark as his , That Papists are only “ Humanity 's carcasses , “ Risen ” — but , by dad , I 'm afeared I can n't give it ye — “ Risen from the sepulchre of — inactivity ; “ And , like owld corpses , dug up from antikity , “ Wandrin ’ about in all sorts of inikity !! ” —<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Even you , Judy , true as you are to the Owld Light , Would have laught , out and out , at this iligant flight Of that figure of speech called the Blatherumskite .

Gentleman 's Speech , June 20 , in the Record Newspaper . LETTER X . FROM THE REV . MORTIMER O'MULLIGAN , TO THE REV . ——. These few brief lines , my reverend friend , By a safe , private hand I send ( Fearing lest some low Catholic wag Should pry into the Letter-bag ) , To tell you , far as pen can dare How we , poor errant martyrs , fare ;— Martyrs , not quite to fire and rack , As Saints were , some few ages back . But — scarce less trying in its way — To laughter , wheresoe'er we stray ; To jokes , which Providence mysterious Permits on men and things so serious , Lowering the Church still more each minute , And — injuring our preferment in it . Just think , how worrying ‘ tis , my friend , To find , where'er our footsteps bend , Small jokes , like squibs , around us whizzing ; And bear the eternal torturing play Of that great engine of our day , Unknown to the Inquisition — quizzing ! Your men of thumb-screws and of racks Aimed at the body their attack ; But modern torturers , more refined , Work their machinery on the mind . Had St. Sebastian had the luck With me to be a godly rover , Instead of arrows , he 'd be stuck With stings of ridicule all over ; And poor St. Lawrence who was killed By being on a gridiron grilled , Had he but shared my errant lot , Instead of grill on gridiron hot , A moral roasting would have got . Nor should I ( trying as all this is ) Much heed the suffering or the shame — As , like an actor , used to hisses , I long have known no other fame , But that ( as I may own to you , Tho ’ to the world it would not do ,) No hope appears of fortune 's beams Shining on any of my schemes ; No chance of something more per ann , As supplement to Kellyman ; No prospect that , by fierce abuse Of Ireland , I shall e'er induce The rulers of this thinking nation To rid us of Emancipation : To forge anew the severed chain , And bring back Penal Laws again . Ah happy time ! when wolves and priests Alike were hunted , as wild beasts ; And five pounds was the price , per head , For bagging either , live or dead ;—<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>Tho ’ oft , we 're told , one outlawed brother Saved cost , by eating up the other , Finding thus all those schemes and hopes I built upon my flowers and tropes All scattered , one by one , away , As flashy and unsound as they , The question comes — what 's to be done ? And there 's but one course left me — one . Heroes , when tired of war 's alarms , Seek sweet repose in Beauty 's arms . The weary Day-God 's last retreat is The breast of silvery-footed Thetis ; And mine , as mighty Love 's my judge , Shall be the arms of rich Miss Fudge ! Start not , my friend ,— the tender scheme , Wild and romantic tho ’ it seem , Beyond a parson 's fondest dream , Yet shines , too , with those golden dyes , So pleasing to a parson 's eyes That only gilding which the Muse Can not around her sons diffuse :— Which , whencesoever flows its bliss , From wealthy Miss or benefice , To Mortimer indifferent is , So he can only make it his . There is but one slight damp I see Upon this scheme 's felicity , And that is , the fair heroine 's claim That I shall take her family name . To this ( tho ’ it may look henpeckt ) , I can  t quite decently object , Having myself long chosen to shine Conspicuous in the alias<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>line ; So that henceforth , by wife 's decree , ( For Biddy from this point won  t budge ) Your old friend 's new address must be The Rev . Mortimer O'Fudge — The “ O ” being kept , that all may see We 're both of ancient family . Such , friend , nor need the fact amaze you , My public life 's a calm Euthanasia . Thus bid I long farewell to all The freaks of Exeter 's old Hall — Freaks , in grimace , its apes exceeding , And rivalling its bears in breeding . Farewell , the platform filled with preachers — The prayer given out , as grace , by speechers , Ere they cut up their fellow-creatures :— Farewell to dead old Dens 's volumes , And , scarce less dead , old Standard 's columns :— From each and all I now retire , My task , henceforth , as spouse and sire , To bring up little filial Fudges , To be M. P. s , and Peers , and Judges — Parsons I 'd add too , if alas ! There yet were hope the Church could pass The gulf now oped for hers and her , Or long survive what Exeter — Both Hall and Bishop , of that name — Have done to sink her reverend fame . Adieu , dear friend — you 'll oft hear from me , Now I 'm no more a travelling drudge ; Meanwhile I sign ( that you may judge How well the surname will become me ) Yours truly , MORTIMER O'FUDGE .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>“ Among other amiable enactments against the Catholics at this period ( 1649 ) , the price of five pounds was set on the head of a Romish priest — being exactly the same sum offered by the same legislators for the head of a wolf . ” — Memoirs of Captain Rock , book i ., chap . 10 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>In the first edition of his Dictionary , Dr. Johnson very significantly exemplified the meaning of the word “ alias ” by the instance of Mallet , the poet , who had exchanged for this more refined name his original Scotch patronymic , Malloch . “ What other proofs he gave [ says Johnson ] of disrespect to his native country , I know not ; but it was remarked of him that he was the only Scot whom Scotchmen did not commend . ” — Life of Mallet . LETTER XI . FROM PATRICK MAGAN , ESQ ., TO THE REV . RICHARD ——. ———, IRELAND . Dear Dick — just arrived at my own humblegîte , I enclose you , post-haste , the account , all complete , Just arrived , per express , of our late noble feat . [ Extract from the “ County Gazette . ” ] This place is getting gay and full again . Last week was married , “ in the Lord , ” The Reverend Mortimer O'Mulligan , Preacher , in Irish , of the Word , He , who the Lord 's force lately led on — ( Exeter Hall his Armagh-geddon ,)[ 1 ] To Miss B. Fudge of Pisgah Place , One of the chosen , as “ heir of grace , ” And likewise heiress of Phil . Fudge , Esquire , defunct , of Orange Lodge . Same evening , Miss F. Fudge , ‘ tis hinted — Niece of the above , ( whose “ Sylvan Lyre , ” In our Gazette , last week , we printed ) . Eloped with Pat . Magan , Esquire . The fugitives were trackt some time , After they 'd left the Aunt 's abode , By scraps of paper scrawled with rhyme , Found strewed along the Western road ;— Some of them , ci-devant curlpapers , Others , half burnt in lighting tapers . This clew , however , to their flight , After some miles was seen no more ; And , from inquiries made last night , We find they 've reached the Irish shore . Every word of it true , Dick — the escape from Aunt 's thrall — Western road — lyric fragments — curl-papers and all . My sole stipulation , ere linkt at the shrine ( As some balance between Fanny 's numbers and mine ) , Was that , when we were one , she must give up the Nine ; Nay , devote to the Gods her whole stock of MS. With a vow never more against prose to transgress . This she did , like a heroine ;— smack went to bits The whole produce sublime of her dear little wits — Sonnets , elegies , epigrams , odes canzonets — Some twisted up neatly , to form allumettes , Some turned into papillotes , worthy to rise And enwreathe Berenice 's bright locks in the skies ! While the rest , honest Larry ( who 's now in my pay ) , Begged , as “ lover of po'thry , ” to read on the way . Having thus of life 's poetry dared to dispose , How we now , Dick , shall manage to get thro ’ its prose , With such slender materials for style , Heaven knows ! But — I 'm called off abruptly — another Express ! What the deuce can it mean ?— I 'm alarmed , I confess . P. S . Hurrah , Dick , hurrah , Dick , ten thousand hurrahs ! I 'm a happy , rich dog to the end of my days . There — read the good news — and while glad , for my sake , That Wealth should thus follow in Love 's shining wake , Admire also the moral — that he , the sly elf , Who has fudged all the world , should be now fudged himself ! EXTRACT FROM LETTER ENCLOSED . With pain the mournful news I write , Miss Fudge 's uncle died last night ; And much to mine and friends ’ surprise , By will doth all his wealth devise — Lands , dwellings — rectories likewise — To his “ beloved grand-niece , ” Miss Fanny , Leaving Miss Fudge herself , who many Long years hath waited — not a penny ! Have notified the same to latter , And wait instructions in the matter . For self and partners , etc .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The rectory which the Rev . gentleman holds is situated in the county of Armagh !— a most remarkable coincidence — and well worthy of the attention of certain expounders of the Apocalypse .</p>
