     <item>THE MEETING .</item>
     <item>I see her still — by her fair train surrounded , The fairest of them all , she took her place ; Afar I stood , by her bright charms confounded , For , oh ! they dazzled with their heavenly grace . With awe my soul was filled — with bliss unbounded , While gazing on her softly radiant face ; But soon , as if up-borne on wings of fire , My fingers ‘ gan to sweep the sounding lyre .</item>
     <item>The thoughts that rushed across me in that hour , The words I sang , I 'd fain once more invoke ; Within , I felt a new-awakened power , That each emotion of my bosom spoke . My soul , long time enchained in sloth 's dull bower , Through all its fetters now triumphant broke , And brought to light unknown , harmonious numbers , Which in its deepest depths , had lived in slumbers .</item>
     <item>And when the chords had ceased their gentle sighing , And when my soul rejoined its mortal frame , I looked upon her face and saw love vieing , In every feature , with her maiden shame . And soon my ravished heart seemed heavenward flying , When her soft whisper o'er my senses came . The blissful seraphs ’ choral strains alone Can glad mine ear again with that sweet tone ,</item>
     <item>Of that fond heart , which , pining silently , Ne'er ventures to express its feelings lowly , The real and modest worth is known to me — ‘ Gainst cruel fate I 'll guard its cause so holy . Most blest of all , the meek one 's lot shall be — Love 's flowers by love 's own hand are gathered solely — The fairest prize to that fond heart is due , That feels it , and that beats responsive , too !</item>

    <head>THE SECRET .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">She sought to breathe one word , but vainly ;</l>
     <l n="2">Too many listeners were nigh ;</l>
     <l n="3">And yet my timid glance read plainly</l>
     <l n="4">The language of her speaking eye .</l>
     <l n="5">Thy silent glades my footstep presses ,</l>
     <l n="6">Thou fair and leaf-embosomed grove !</l>
     <l n="7">Conceal within thy green recesses</l>
     <l n="8">From mortal eye our sacred love !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Afar with strange discordant noises ,</l>
     <l n="10">The busy day is echoing ;</l>
     <l n="11">And ‘ mid the hollow hum of voices ,</l>
     <l n="12">I hear the heavy hammer ring .</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Tis thus that man , with toil ne'er ending</l>
     <l n="14">Extorts from heaven his daily bread ;</l>
     <l n="15">Yet oft unseen the Gods are sending</l>
     <l n="16">The gifts of fortune on his head !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Oh , let mankind discover never</l>
     <l n="18">How true love fills with bliss our hearts</l>
     <l n="19">They would but crush our joy forever ,</l>
     <l n="20">For joy to them no glow imparts .</l>
     <l n="21">Thou ne'er wilt from the world obtain it —</l>
     <l n="22">‘ Tis never captured save as prey ;</l>
     <l n="23">Thou needs must strain each nerve to gain it ,</l>
     <l n="24">E'er envy dark asserts her sway .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">The hours of night and stillness loving ,</l>
     <l n="26">It comes upon us silently —</l>
     <l n="27">Away with hasty footstep moving</l>
     <l n="28">Soon as it sees a treacherous eye .</l>
     <l n="29">Thou gentle stream , soft circlets weaving ,</l>
     <l n="30">A watery barrier cast around ,</l>
     <l n="31">And , with thy waves in anger heaving ,</l>
     <l n="32">Guard from each foe this holy ground !</l>

    <head>THE ASSIGNATION .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span></head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hear I the creaking gate unclose ?</l>
     <l n="2">The gleaming latch uplifted ?</l>
     <l n="3">No — ‘ twas the wind that , whirring , rose ,</l>
     <l n="4">Amidst the poplars drifted !</l>
     <l n="5">Adorn thyself , thou green leaf-bowering roof ,</l>
     <l n="6">Destined the bright one 's presence to receive ,</l>
     <l n="7">For her , a shadowy palace-hall aloof</l>
     <l n="8">With holy night , thy boughs familiar weave .</l>
     <l n="9">And ye sweet flatteries of the delicate air ,</l>
     <l n="10">Awake and sport her rosy cheek around ,</l>
     <l n="11">When their light weight the tender feet shall bear ,</l>
     <l n="12">When beauty comes to passion 's trysting-ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">Hush ! what amidst the copses crept —</l>
     <l n="14">So swiftly by me now ?</l>
     <l n="15">No- ‘ twas the startled bird that swept</l>
     <l n="16">The light leaves of the bough !</l>
     <l n="17">Day , quench thy torch ! come , ghostlike , from on high ,</l>
     <l n="18">With thy loved silence , come , thou haunting Eve ,</l>
     <l n="19">Broaden below thy web of purple dye ,</l>
     <l n="20">Which lulled boughs mysterious round us weave .</l>
     <l n="21">For love 's delight , enduring listeners none ,</l>
     <l n="22">The froward witness of the light will flee ;</l>
     <l n="23">Hesper alone , the rosy silent one ,</l>
     <l n="24">Down-glancing may our sweet familiar be !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="25">What murmur in the distance spoke ,</l>
     <l n="26">And like a whisper died ?</l>
     <l n="27">No — ‘ twas the swan that gently broke</l>
     <l n="28">In rings the silver tide !</l>
     <l n="29">Soft to my ear there comes a music-flow ;</l>
     <l n="30">In gleesome murmur glides the waterfall ;</l>
     <l n="31">To zephyr 's kiss the flowers are bending low ;</l>
     <l n="32">Through life goes joy , exchanging joy with all .</l>
     <l n="33">Tempt to the touch the grapes — the blushing fruit ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span></l>
     <l n="34">Voluptuous swelling from the leaves that bide ;</l>
     <l n="35">And , drinking fever from my cheek , the mute</l>
     <l n="36">Air sleeps all liquid in the odor-tide !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">Hark ! through the alley hear I now</l>
     <l n="38">A footfall ? Comes the maiden ?</l>
     <l n="39">No ,— ‘ twas the fruit slid from the bough ,</l>
     <l n="40">With its own richness laden !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="41">Day 's lustrous eyes grow heavy in sweet death ,</l>
     <l n="42">And pale and paler wane his jocund hues ,</l>
     <l n="43">The flowers too gentle for his glowing breath ,</l>
     <l n="44">Ope their frank beauty to the twilight dews .</l>
     <l n="45">The bright face of the moon is still and lone ,</l>
     <l n="46">Melts in vast masses the world silently ;</l>
     <l n="47">Slides from each charm the slowly-loosening zone ;</l>
     <l n="48">And round all beauty , veilless , roves the eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">What yonder seems to glimmer ?</l>
     <l n="50">Her white robe 's glancing hues ?</l>
     <l n="51">No ,— ‘ twas the column 's shimmer</l>
     <l n="52">Athwart the darksome yews !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="53">O , longing heart , no more delight-upbuoyed</l>
     <l n="54">Let the sweet airy image thee befool !</l>
     <l n="55">The arms that would embrace her clasp the void</l>
     <l n="56">This feverish breast no phantom-bliss can cool ,</l>
     <l n="57">O , waft her here , the true , the living one !</l>
     <l n="58">Let but my hand her hand , the tender , feel —</l>
     <l n="59">The very shadow of her robe alone !—</l>
     <l n="60">So into life the idle dream shall steal !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="61">As glide from heaven , when least we ween ,</l>
     <l n="62">The rosy hours of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="63">All gently came the maid , unseen :—</l>
     <l n="64">He waked beneath her kiss !</l>

    <head>LONGING .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Could I from this valley drear ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where the mist hangs heavily ,</l>
     <l n="3">Soar to some more blissful sphere ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ah ! how happy should I be !</l>
     <l n="5">Distant hills enchant my sight ,</l>
     <l n="6">Ever young and ever fair ;</l>
     <l n="7">To those hills I 'd take my flight</l>
     <l n="8">Had I wings to scale the air .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Harmonies mine ear assail ,</l>
     <l n="10">Tunes that breathe a heavenly calm ;</l>
     <l n="11">And the gently-sighing gale</l>
     <l n="12">Greets me with its fragrant balm .</l>
     <l n="13">Peeping through the shady bowers ,</l>
     <l n="14">Golden fruits their charms display .</l>
     <l n="15">And those sweetly-blooming flowers</l>
     <l n="16">Ne'er become cold winter 's prey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">In you endless sunshine bright ,</l>
     <l n="18">Oh ! what bliss ‘ twould be to dwell !</l>
     <l n="19">How the breeze on yonder height</l>
     <l n="20">Must the heart with rapture swell !</l>
     <l n="21">Yet the stream that hems my path</l>
     <l n="22">Checks me with its angry frown ,</l>
     <l n="23">While its waves , in rising wrath ,</l>
     <l n="24">Weigh my weary spirit down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="25">See — a bark is drawing near ,</l>
     <l n="26">But , alas , the pilot fails !</l>
     <l n="27">Enter boldly — wherefore fear ?</l>
     <l n="28">Inspiration fills its sails ,</l>
     <l n="29">Faith and courage make thine own ,—</l>
     <l n="30">Gods ne'er lend a helping-hand ;</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Tis by magic power alone</l>
     <l n="32">Thou canst reach the magic land !</l>

    <head>THE PILGRIM .</head>
     <l n="1">Youth 's gay springtime scarcely knowing</l>
     <l n="2">Went I forth the world to roam —</l>
     <l n="3">And the dance of youth , the glowing ,</l>
     <l n="4">Left I in my father 's home ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of my birthright , glad-believing ,</l>
     <l n="6">Of my world-gear took I none ,</l>
     <l n="7">Careless as an infant , cleaving</l>
     <l n="8">To my pilgrim staff alone .</l>
     <l n="9">For I placed my mighty hope in</l>
     <l n="10">Dim and holy words of faith ,</l>
     <l n="11">“ Wander forth — the way is open ,</l>
     <l n="12">Ever on the upward path —</l>
     <l n="13">Till thou gain the golden portal ,</l>
     <l n="14">Till its gates unclose to thee .</l>
     <l n="15">There the earthly and the mortal ,</l>
     <l n="16">Deathless and divine shall be ! ”</l>
     <l n="17">Night on morning stole , on stealeth ,</l>
     <l n="18">Never , never stand I still ,</l>
     <l n="19">And the future yet concealeth ,</l>
     <l n="20">What I seek , and what I will !</l>
     <l n="21">Mount on mount arose before me ,</l>
     <l n="22">Torrents hemmed me every side ,</l>
     <l n="23">But I built a bridge that bore me</l>
     <l n="24">O'er the roaring tempest-tide .</l>
     <l n="25">Towards the east I reached a river ,</l>
     <l n="26">On its shores I did not rest ;</l>
     <l n="27">Faith from danger can deliver ,</l>
     <l n="28">And I trusted to its breast .</l>
     <l n="29">Drifted in the whirling motion ,</l>
     <l n="30">Seas themselves around me roll —</l>
     <l n="31">Wide and wider spreads the ocean ,</l>
     <l n="32">Far and farther flies the goal .</l>
     <l n="33">While I live is never given</l>
     <l n="34">Bridge or wave the goal to near —</l>
     <l n="35">Earth will never meet the heaven ,</l>

     <l n="20">And life diffused through every limb ,</l>
     <l n="21">So I , with youthful passion fired ,</l>

     <l n="3">Thee , too , I hail , thou smiling plain , and ye murmuring lindens ,</l>

   <p>PUPIL . I am rejoiced , worthy sirs , to find you in pleno assembled ; For I have come down below , seeking the one needful thing .</p>
   <p>ARISTOTLE . Quick to the point , my good friend ! For the Jena Gazette comes to hand here , Even in hell ,— so we know all that is passing above .</p>
   <p>PUPIL . So much the better ! So give me ( I will not depart hence without it ) Some good principle now ,— one that will always avail !</p>
   <p>FIRST PHILOSOPHER . Cogito , ergo sum . I have thought , and therefore existence ! If the first be but true , then is the second one sure .</p>
   <p>PUPIL . As I think , I exist . ‘ Tis good ! But who always is thinking ? Oft I 've existed e'en when I have been thinking of naught .</p>
   <p>SECOND PHILOSOPHER . Since there are things that exist , a thing of all things there must needs be ; In the thing of all things dabble we , just as we are .</p>
   <p>THIRD PHILOSOPHER . Just the reverse , say I . Besides myself there is nothing ; Everything else that there is is but a bubble to me .</p>
   <p>FOURTH PHILOSOPHER . Two kinds of things I allow to exist ,— the world and the spirit ; Naught of others I know ; even these signify one .</p>
   <p>FIFTH PHILOSOPHER . I know naught of the thing , and know still less of the spirit ; Both but appear unto me ; yet no appearance they are .</p>
   <p>SIXTH PHILOSOPHER . I am I , and settle myself ,— and if I then settle Nothing to be , well and good — there 's a nonentity formed .</p>
   <p>SEVENTH PHILOSOPHER . There is conception at least ! A thing conceived there is , therefore ; And a conceiver as well ,— which , with conception , make three .</p>
   <p>PUPIL . All this nonsense , good sirs , wo n't answer my purpose a tittle : I a real principle need ,— one by which something is fixed .</p>
   <p>EIGHTH PHILOSOPHER . Nothing is now to be found in the theoretical province ; Practical principles hold , such as : thou canst , for thou shouldst .</p>
   <p>PUPIL . If I but thought so ! When people know no more sensible answer , Into the conscience at once plunge they with desperate haste .</p>
   <p>DAVID HUME . Do n't converse with those fellows ! That Kant has turned them all crazy ; Speak to me , for in hell I am the same that I was .</p>
   <p>LAW POINT . I have made use of my nose for years together to smell with ; Have I a right to my nose that can be legally proved ?</p>
   <p>PUFFENDORF . Truly a delicate point ! Yet the first possession appeareth In thy favor to tell ; therefore make use of it still !</p>
   <p>SCRUPLE OF CONSCIENCE . Willingly serve I my friends ; but , alas , I do it with pleasure ; Therefore I often am vexed that no true virtue I have .</p>
   <p>DECISION . As there is no other means , thou hadst better begin to despise them ; And with aversion , then , do that which thy duty commands .</p>

    <head>DEDICATION TO DEATH , MY PRINCIPAL .</head>
     <l n="1">Most high and mighty Czar of all flesh , ceaseless reducer of empires ,</l>
     <l n="2">unfathomable glutton in the whole realms of nature .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With the most profound flesh-creeping I take the liberty of kissing the rattling leg-bones of your voracious Majesty , and humbly laying this little book at your dried-up feet . My predecessors have always been accustomed , as if on purpose to annoy you , to transport their goods and chattels to the archives of eternity , directly under your nose , forgetting that , by so doing , they only made your mouth water the more , for the proverb — Stolen bread tastes sweetest — is applicable even to you . No ! I prefer to dedicate this work to you , feeling assured that you will throw it aside .</p>
   <p>But , joking apart ! methinks we two know each other better than by mere hearsay . Enrolled in the order of Aesculapius , the first-born of Pandora 's box , as old as the fall of man , I have stood at your altar ,— have sworn undying hatred to your hereditary foe , Nature , as the son of Hamilcar to the seven hills of Rome ,— have sworn to besiege her with a whole army of medicines ,— to throw up barricades round the obstinate soul ,— to drive from the field the insolents who cut down your fees and cripple your finances ,— and on the Archaean battle-plain to plant your midnight standard . In return ( for one good turn deserves another ) , you must prepare for me the precious TALISMAN , which can save me from the gallows and the wheel uninjured , and with a whole skin —</p>
   <p>Jusque datum sceleri .</p>
   <p>Come then ! act the generous Maecenas ; for observe , I should be sorry to fare like my foolhardy colleagues and cousins , who , armed with stiletto and pocket-pistol , hold their court in gloomy ravines , or mix in the subterranean laboratory the wondrous polychrest , which , when taken with proper zeal , tickles our political noses , either too little or too much , with throne vacancies or state-fevers . D'Amiens and Ravaillac !— Ho , ho , ho !— ‘ Tis a good thing for straight limbs !</p>
   <p>Perhaps you have been whetting your teeth at Easter and Michaelmas ?— the great book-epidemic times at Leipzig and Frankfort ! Hurrah for the waste-paper !— ‘ twill make a royal feast . Your nimble brokers , Gluttony and Lust , bring you whole cargoes from the fair of life . Even Ambition , your grandpapa — War , Famine , Fire , and Plague , your mighty huntsmen , have provided you with many a jovial man-chase . Avarice and Covetousness , your sturdy butlers , drink to your health whole towns floating in the bubbling cup of the world-ocean . I know a kitchen in Europe where the rarest dishes have been served up in your honor with festive pomp . And yet — who has ever known you to be satisfied , or to complain of indigestion ? Your digestive faculties are of iron ; your entrails fathomless !</p>
   <p>Pooh — I had many other things to say to you , but I am in a hurry to be off . You are an ugly brother-in-law — go ! I hear you are calculating on living to see a general collation , where great and small , globes and lexicons , philosophies and knick-knacks , will fly into your jaws — a good appetite to you , should it come to that .— Yet , ravenous wolf that you are ! take care that you do n't overeat yourself , and have to disgorge to a hair all that you have swallowed , as a certain Athenian ( no particular friend of yours , by-the-by ) has prophesied .</p>

   <p>Flowers in Siberia ? Behind this lies a piece of knavery , or the sun must make face against midnight . And yet — if ye were to exert yourselves ! ‘ Tis really so ; we have been hunting sables long enough ; let us for once in a way try our luck with flowers . Have not enough Europeans come to us stepsons of the sun , and waded through our hundred years ’ snow , to pluck a modest flower ? Shame upon our ancestors — we 'll gather them ourselves , and frank a whole basketful to Europe . Do not crush them , ye children of a milder heaven !</p>
   <p>But to be serious ; to remove the iron weight of prejudice that broods heavily over the north , requires a stronger lever than the enthusiasm of a few individuals , and a firmer Hypomochlion than the shoulders of two or three patriots . Yet if this anthology reconciles you squeamish Europeans to us snow-men as little as — let 's suppose the case — our “ Muses ’ Almanac , ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span>which we — let 's again suppose the case — might have written , it will at least have the merit of helping its companions through the whole of Germany to give the last neck-stab to expiring taste , as we people of Tobolsko like to word it .</p>
   <p>If your Homers talk in their sleep , and your Herculeses kill flies with their clubs — if every one who knows how to give vent to his portion of sorrow in dreary Alexandrines , interprets that as a call to Helicon , shall we northerns be blamed for tinkling the Muses ’ lyre ?— Your matadors claim to have coined silver when they have stamped their effigy on wretched pewter ; and at Tobolsko coiners are hanged . ‘ Tis true that you may often find paper-money amongst us instead of Russian roubles , but war and hard times are an excuse for anything .</p>
   <p>Go forth then , Siberian anthology ! Go ! Thou wilt make many a coxcomb happy , wilt be placed by him on the toilet-table of his sweetheart , and in reward wilt obtain her alabaster , lily-white hand for his tender kiss . Go ! thou wilt fill up many a weary gulf of ennui in assemblies and city-visits , and may be relieve a Circassienne , who has confessed herself weary amidst a shower of calumnies . Go ! thou wilt be consulted in the kitchens of many critics ; they will fly thy light , and like the screech-owl , retreat into thy shadow . Ho , ho , ho ! Already I hear the ear-cracking howls in the inhospitable forest , and anxiously conceal myself in my sable .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>It may be scarcely necessary to treat , however briefly , of the mythological legend on which this exquisite elegy is founded ; yet we venture to do so rather than that the forgetfulness of the reader should militate against his enjoyment of the poem . Proserpine , according to the Homeride ( for the story is not without variations ) , when gathering flowers with the Ocean-Nymphs , is carried off by Aidoneus , or Pluto . Her mother , Ceres , wanders over the earth for her in vain , and refuses to return to heaven till her daughter is restored to her . Finally , Jupiter commissions Hermes to persuade Pluto to render up his bride , who rejoins Ceres at Eleusis . Unfortunately she has swallowed a pomegranate seed in the Shades below , and is thus mysteriously doomed to spend one-third of the year with her husband in Hades , though for the remainder of the year she is permitted to dwell with Ceres and the gods . This is one of the very few mythological fables of Greece which can be safely interpreted into an allegory . Proserpine denotes the seed-corn one-third of the year below the earth ; two-thirds ( that is , dating from the appearance of the ear ) above it . Schiller has treated this story with admirable and artistic beauty ; and , by an alteration in its symbolical character has preserved the pathos of the external narrative , and heightened the beauty of the interior meaning — associating the productive principle of the earth with the immortality of the soul . Proserpine here is not the symbol of the buried seed , but the buried seed is the symbol of her — that is , of the dead . The exquisite feeling of this poem consoled Schiller 's friend , Sophia La Roche , in her grief for her son 's death .<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>What a beautiful vindication of the shortness of human life !</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span>We have already seen in “ The Ring of Polycrates , ” Schiller 's mode of dealing with classical subjects . In the poems that follow , derived from similar sources , the same spirit is maintained . In spite of Humboldt , we venture to think that Schiller certainly does not narrate Greek legends in the spirit of an ancient Greek . The Gothic sentiment , in its ethical depth and mournful tenderness , more or less pervades all that he translates from classic fable into modern pathos . The grief of Hero in the ballad subjoined , touches closely on the lamentations of Thekla , in “ Wallenstein . ” The Complaint of Ceres , embodies Christian grief and Christian hope . The Trojan Cassandra expresses the moral of the Northern Faust . Even the “ Victory Feast ” changes the whole spirit of Homer , on whom it is founded , by the introduction of the ethical sentiment at the close , borrowed , as a modern would apply what he so borrows from the moralizing Horace . Nothing can be more foreign to the Hellenic genius , ( if we except the very disputable intention of the “ Prometheus ” ) , than the interior and typical design which usually exalts every conception in Schiller . But it is perfectly open to the modern poet to treat of ancient legends in the modern spirit . Though he selects a Greek story , he is still a modern who narrates — he can never make himself a Greek any more than Aeschylus in the “ Persae ” could make himself a Persian . But this is still more the privilege of the poet in narrative , or lyrical composition , than in the drama , for in the former he does not abandon his identity , as in the latter he must — yet even this must has its limits . Shakspeare 's wonderful power of self-transfusion has no doubt enabled him , in his plays from Roman history , to animate his characters with much of Roman life . But no one can maintain that a Roman would ever have written plays in the least resembling “ Julius Caesar , ” or “ Coriolanus , ” or “ Antony and Cleopatra . ” The portraits may be Roman , but they are painted in the manner of the Gothic school . The spirit of antiquity is only in them , inasmuch as the representation of human nature , under certain circumstances , is accurately , though loosely outlined . When the poet raises the dead , it is not to restore , but to remodel .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 37 ]</span>This story , the heroes of which are more properly known to us under the names of Damon and Pythias ( or Phintias ) , Schiller took from Hyginus in whom the friends are called Moerus and Selinuntius . Schiller has somewhat amplified the incidents in the original , in which the delay of Moerus is occasioned only by the swollen stream — the other hindrances are of Schiller 's invention . The subject , like “ The Ring of Polycrates , ” does not admit of that rich poetry of description with which our author usually adorns some single passage in his narratives . The poetic spirit is rather shown in the terse brevity with which picture after picture is not only sketched but finished — and in the great thought at the close . Still it is not one of Schiller 's best ballads . His additions to the original story are not happy . The incident of the robbers is commonplace and poor . The delay occasioned by the thirst of Moerus is clearly open to Goethe 's objection ( an objection showing very nice perception of nature ) — that extreme thirst was not likely to happen to a man who had lately passed through a stream on a rainy day , and whose clothes must have been saturated with moisture — nor in the traveller 's preoccupied state of mind , is it probable that he would have so much felt the mere physical want . With less reason has it been urged by other critics , that the sudden relenting of the tyrant is contrary to his character . The tyrant here has no individual character at all . He is the mere personation of disbelief in truth and love — which the spectacle of sublime self-abnegation at once converts . In this idea lies the deep philosophical truth , which redeems all the defects of the piece — for poetry , in its highest form , is merely this — “ Truth made beautiful . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>The somewhat irregular metre of the original has been preserved in this ballad , as in other poems ; although the perfect anapaestic metre is perhaps more familiar to the English ear .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span>This poem is very characteristic of the noble ease with which Schiller often loves to surprise the reader , by the sudden introduction of matter for the loftiest reflection in the midst of the most familiar subjects . What can be more accurate and happy than the poet 's description of the national dance , as if such description were his only object — the outpouring , as it were , of a young gallant intoxicated by the music , and dizzy with the waltz ? Suddenly and imperceptibly the reader finds himself elevated from a trivial scene . He is borne upward to the harmony of the sphere . He bows before the great law of the universe — the young gallant is transformed into the mighty teacher ; and this without one hard conceit — without one touch of pedantry . It is but a flash of light ; and where glowed the playful picture shines the solemn moral .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 53 ]</span>The first five verses in the original of this poem are placed as a motto on Goethe 's statue in the Library at Weimar . The poet does not here mean to extol what is vulgarly meant by the gifts of fortune ; he but develops a favorite idea of his , that , whatever is really sublime and beautiful , comes freely down from heaven ; and vindicates the seeming partiality of the gods , by implying that the beauty and the genius given , without labor , to some , but serve to the delight of those to whom they are denied .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 56 ]</span>This simile is nobly conceived , but expressed somewhat obscurely . As Hercules contended in vain against Antaeus , the Son of Earth — so long as the earth gave her giant offspring new strength in every fall ,— so the soul contends in vain with evil — the natural earth-born enemy , while the very contact of the earth invigorates the enemy for the struggle . And as Antaeus was slain at last , when Hercules lifted him from the earth , and strangled him while raised aloft , so can the soul slay the enemy ( the desire , the passion , the evil , the earth 's offspring ) , when bearing it from earth itself , and stifling it in the higher air .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 57 ]</span>By this Schiller informs us elsewhere that he does not mean death alone ; but that the thought applies equally to every period of life when we can divest ourselves of the body and perceive or act as pure spirits ; we are truly then under the influence of the sublime .</p>
