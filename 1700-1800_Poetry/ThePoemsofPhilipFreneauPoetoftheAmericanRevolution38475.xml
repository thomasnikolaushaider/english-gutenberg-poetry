    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The present edition of the poetical works of Philip Freneau was begun at the advice of the late lamented Moses Coit Tyler . In his opinion there were few fields in American history that needed exploring more , and few that would require on the part of the explorer more of the Columbus spirit .</p>
    <p n="2">It would be almost impossible for a poet to pass more completely into the shadow than has Freneau during the century since his activities closed . His poems are , almost all of them in their earliest editions , exceedingly rare and costly and only to be read by those who can have access to the largest libraries , his letters and papers have almost entirely disappeared , and his biography in almost every book of reference has been so distorted by misstatement and omission as to be really grotesque .</p>
    <p n="3">This neglect has resulted not from lack of real worth in the man , but from prejudices born during one of the most bitter and stormy eras of partisan politics that America has ever known . What Sidney Smith said of Scotland at this period was true here : “ The principles of the French Revolution were fully afloat and it is impossible to conceive a more violent and agitated state of society . ” Freneau was a victim of this intense era . New England rejected him with scorn and all admirers of Washington echoed his epithet , “ that rascal Freneau . ” Thus it has become the tradition to belittle his work , to vilify his character , and to sum up his whole career , as a prominent New Englander has recently done , by alluding to him as a “ creature of the opposition . ”</p>
    <p n="4">Unprejudiced criticism , however , has always exalted Freneau 's work . The great Scotch dictator Jeffrey , with all his scorn for American literature , could say that “ the time would arrive when his poetry , like that of Hudibras , would command a commentator like Gray ; ” and Sir Walter Scott once declared that “ Eutaw Springs [ was ] as fine a thing as there is of the kind in the language . ” E. A. Duyckinck did not hesitate to group him as one of “ four of the most original writers whom the country has produced , ” and S. G. W. Benjamin could say in 1887 : “ In all the history of American letters , or of the United States press , there is no figure more interesting or remarkable , no career more versatile and varied than that of Philip Freneau . ” Such testimony might be multiplied . Surely had the poet been an ordinary man , Jefferson would never have said “ his paper has saved our Constitution , ” Madison would not have pronounced him a man of genius , and Adams would hardly have admitted that he was a leading element in his defeat .</p>
    <p n="5">I have endeavored not only to rescue the most significant of Freneau 's poems , but to arrange them as far as possible in their order of composition , or at least in the order in which they first appeared in print . It has seemed to me highly important to do this since such an arrangement , especially with a poet like Freneau , who drew his themes almost wholly from the range of his own observation , would be virtually an autobiography , and since it would also furnish a running commentary upon the history of a stirring period in our annals . The task has been no slight one . It has necessitated a search through the files of a large proportion of the early newspapers and periodicals and a minute investigation of every other source of possible information .</p>
    <p n="6">Much material has been rescued that , as far as the public was concerned , had practically become extinct . I have introduced the unique fragment of an unpublished drama , “ The Spy , ” which I was the first to explore . I have taken pains to reproduce the poet 's early poetical pamphlets dealing with the first year of the Revolution , not one of which has ever been republished . The revisions of many of these used by Freneau in his later collections were so thoroughgoing as to be in reality entirely new poems . “ The Voyage to Boston , ” for instance , published during the siege of Boston , was cut down for the 1786 edition from six hundred and five lines to three hundred and six lines , and of these more than half were entirely changed . From the standpoint of the historian , at least , the original version is much more valuable than that made several years after the war was over . This is true of all the earlier pamphlet poems . Aside from their value as specimens of Freneau 's earlier muse they are valuable commentaries on the history of the stormy times that called them forth , and I have not hesitated to reprint them verbatim in connection with the revised versions . The pamphlet poems “ American Liberty ” and “ General Gage 's Confession , ” ( until recently supposed to have been lost ) exist only in unique copies . Freneau never attempted to revise them . Some of the other early poems , notably “ The House of Night , ” I have annotated with care , showing the evolution of the poem from its first nucleus to its final fragmentary form . In the case of a few of the more important poems , especially those dealing with the Revolution , I have given variorum readings .</p>
    <p n="7">Aside from this early material , which has a real historical value , I have introduced very few poems not included in Freneau 's collected editions of 1786 , 1788 , 1795 , 1809 and 1815 . Previous to 1795 the poet reprinted with miserly care almost all the verses which he had contributed to the press . In his later years he was more prodigal of his creations . I have , however , reprinted from newspapers very few poems not found elsewhere , and these few only on the best evidence that they were genuine , for it has been my experience that when a poem is not to be found in the collected editions of the poet it is almost certain that it is not genuine . In justice to Freneau , who had the welfare of his writings much at heart , and who cut and pruned and remodeled with tireless hand , I have usually given the latest version .</p>
    <p n="8">I wish to acknowledge here my great indebtedness to the descendants of Philip Freneau , especially Miss Adele M. Sweeney , Mr. Weymer J . Mills , Mrs. Helen K. Vreeland , and Mrs. Eleanor F. Noel , who have allowed me to consult freely all the papers and literary remains of the poet and have supplied me with all possible information . I would also express my great obligation to many librarians , collectors , and scholars , who have cheerfully aided me , especially to Mr. Wilberforce Eames , of the New York Public Library , the late Paul Leicester Ford , Mr. Robert H. Kelby , of the New York Historical Society , Mr. John W. Jordan , of the Pennsylvania Historical Society , Mr. A. S. Salley , Jr ., of Charleston , S. C ., Mr. E. M. Barton , of the American Antiquarian Society , and Dr. E. C. Richardson , of Princeton University , who with their courteous helpfulness have made possible the work . I wish also to express my thanks to Professor A. Howry Espenshade , and Mr. John Rogers Williams , to whose careful and patient work upon the proofs the accuracy of the text depends .</p>

   <head>LIFE OF PHILIP FRENEAU</head>
    <head>I .</head>
   <p>In the possession of the Freneau descendants there is an old French Bible , printed in Geneva , Switzerland , in 1587 , which preserves an unbroken roll of the heads of the family back to the original owner of the book , Philip Fresneau , who on his death-bed in La Chapelle , France , in 1590 , gave it into the hands of his eldest son . For five generations the book remained in the little suburban village , its possessors sturdy , industrious tradesmen , who stood high in the esteem of their community and yet who on account of their Protestant faith were often imposed upon and at times even persecuted . It was doubtless this feeling of insecurity , if not positive persecution , which compelled Andre Fresneau , like so many of his fellow Huguenots , to leave his native village and to seek a home in a more tolerant land .</p>
   <p>He landed in New York in 1707 . He was in his thirty-sixth year , an active , handsome man , almost brilliant in certain directions , of pleasing address , and skilled from his youth in the handling of affairs . He became at once a leader in the little Huguenot Colony whose center was the quaint old church “ du St. Esprit ” on Pine street . He was soon in the midst of a thriving shipping business , dealing largely in imported wines , and in 1710 , three years after his arrival , he was able to furnish a beautiful home on Pearl street , near Hanover Square , for his young bride , Mary Morin , a daughter of Pierre Morin , of the French Congregation . Of the comfort and hospitality of this home there are many contemporary references . John Fontaine , the French traveller , was entertained here in 1716 and he speaks highly of his host and his entertainment .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>In 1721 Mrs. Fresneau died at the early age of twenty-seven , leaving behind a family of five children , the oldest only nine years of age . Four years later the father followed . But the young family was far from destitute . The business house in New York had grown to be very profitable and there was a large landed estate in eastern New Jersey , a part of which was sold in 1740 . Soon the two eldest sons , Andrew , born 1712 , and Pierre , born January 22 , 1718 , were able to continue their father 's business . For years their firm name was familiar in New York .</p>
   <p>Pierre Freneau ( the family seem to have dropped the “ s ” about 1725 ) was married in 1748 to Agnes Watson , daughter of Richard Watson , of Freehold , whose property bordered upon the Freneau estate . They made their home in Frankfort street , New York , and here on January 2 ( O. S .) , 1752 , was born their eldest child , Philip Morin Freneau , the subject of our sketch . Four other children came from their union , of whom only one , Peter , born April 5 , 1757 , who in later years became a prominent figure in Charleston , S. C ., need be mentioned .</p>
   <p>The home of the Freneau 's was one of comfort and even refinement . There was a large and well selected library , the pride of its owner . “ There , ” he would say to his visitors , pointing to his books , “ use them freely , for among them you will find your truest friends . ” He delighted in men of refinement , and his home became a social center for the lovers of books and of culture . He looked carefully after the education of his children ; and all of them early became omnivorous readers . In such an environment the young poet passed his first ten years .</p>
   <p>In 1762 the family decided to leave New York and to make their home permanently on their estate , “ Mount Pleasant , ” near Middletown Point , N. J . The estate at this time contained nearly a thousand acres , and with its large buildings , its slaves and its broad area under cultivation , was in many respects like a southern plantation . Heretofore the elder Freneau had made it of secondary importance . He had used it as a summer resort , and as a pleasant relief to the monotony of his city business , but now , perhaps on account of failing health , he determined to devote to it all of his energies . Philip was left behind in New York . For the next three years he lived at a boarding school in the city , going home only during the long vacations . At the age of thirteen he was sent to the Latin school at Penolopen , then presided over by the Rev . Alexander Mitchell , to prepare for college .</p>
   <p>The father of the family died Oct. 17 , 1767 . This , however , did not disturb the plans of the eldest son , and on Nov. 7 , 1768 , he entered the sophomore class at Princeton so well prepared that President Witherspoon is said to have sent a letter of congratulation to his mother .</p>
   <p>II .</p>
   <p>Of the college life of Philip Freneau we have only fragmentary records . He was in his sixteenth year when he entered , a somewhat dreamy youth who had read very widely , especially in the English poets and the Latin classics , and who already commanded a facile pen , especially in the field of heroic verse . During the year in which he entered Princeton he composed two long poems , “ The History of the Prophet Jonah , ” and “ The Village Merchant , ” — surely notable work for the pen of a college sophomore . During the following year he wrote “ The Pyramids of Egypt , ” and before his graduation he had completed several other pieces , some of them full of real poetic inspiration .</p>
   <p>The period during which Freneau resided at Princeton was a most significant one . In the same class with him were James Madison , H. H. Brackenridge , the author of “ Modern Chivalry ” and a conspicuous figure in later Pennsylvania history , and Samuel Spring , who was to become widely influential in religious circles . In the class below him were the refined and scholarly William Bradford and the brilliant Aaron Burr . The shadow of the coming struggle with Great Britain was already lengthening over the Colonies and nowhere was its presence more manifest than in the colleges , always the most sensitive areas in times of tyranny and oppression . On August 6 , 1770 , the senior class at Princeton voted unanimously to appear at commencement dressed in American manufactures .</p>
   <p>Another circumstance made the period a notable one . On June 24 , 1769 , a little band of students , headed by Madison , Brackenridge , Bradford and Freneau , organized an undergraduate fraternity to be called the American Whig Society . One year later The Well Meaning Club , a rival literary organization founded in 1765 , became the Cliosophic Society . The act was the signal for a war , the echoes of which have even yet not died away at Princeton . There exists a manuscript book ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>rescued from the papers of William Bradford , in which are preserved the poetic tirades , called forth in this first onset . Its title page is as follows :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Satires | against the Tories . | Written in the last War between the</l>
     <l n="2">Whigs &amp; Cliosophians | in which | the former obtained a compleat</l>
     <l n="3">Victory .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">— Arm 'd for virtue now we point the pen</l>
     <l n="5">Brand the bold front of shameless , guilty men</l>
     <l n="6">Dash the proud Tory in his gilded Car</l>
     <l n="7">Bare the mean heart that hides beneath a star . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="8">It opens with ten “ pastorals ” by Brackenridge , of which the ninth begins</l>
     <l n="9">thus :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="10">“ Spring 's Soliloquy that morning before he hung himself .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="11">O World adieu ! the doleful time draws nigh</l>
     <l n="12">I cannot live and yet I fear to die</l>
     <l n="13">Warford is dead ! and in his turn Freneau</l>
     <l n="14">Will send me headlong to the shades below .</l>
     <l n="15">What raging fury or what baleful Star</l>
     <l n="16">Did find — ingulph me in the whiggish war</l>
     <l n="17">The deeds of darkness which my soul hath done</l>
     <l n="18">Are now apparent as the noon-day sun</l>
     <l n="19">A Thousand things as yet remain untold</l>
     <l n="20">My secret practice and my sins of old . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Then follow several satires by Freneau , full of fire and invective , but like the work of all the others , not always refined or quotable in print . His satire , “ McSwiggen , ” printed in 1775 , contains nearly half of the poems ,— the only lines indeed which are of any real merit . The three concluding poems of the collection , and these by all means the worst of the lot , are from no less a pen than Madison 's . No patriotic citizen will ever venture to resurrect them .</p>
   <p>There is a tradition very widely current that Freneau was for a time the room-mate of Madison . However this may be , there is no question as to who was his most intimate friend . With Brackenridge he had much in common . Both had dreams of a literary life , both had read largely in polite literature , both scribbled constantly in prose and verse . In the same manuscript volume with the Clio-Whig satires there is an extensive fragment of a novel written alternately by Brackenridge and Freneau , between September 20th and October 22d , 1770 . Its manuscript title page is as follows :</p>
   <p>“ Father Bombo 's | Pilgrimage to Mecca in Arabia . | Vol . II . | Wherein is given a true account of the innumerable and | surprizing adventures which befell him in the course of that | long and tedious Journey , | Till he once more returned safe to his native Land , as related | by his own mouth . | Written By B. H. and P. F .— 1770 .</p>
   <p>Mutato nomine Fabula de te narratur — Hor . Change but the name The story 's told of you . MDVIILXX . ”</p>
   <p>The adventures of the hero read like chapters from the “ Arabian Nights . ” He has been for seven days a close captive on a French man-of-war , but he is rescued by an Irish privateer , only to be taken for a wizard and thrown overboard in a cask which is finally washed ashore on the north coast of Ireland . It would be useless to recount all of his adventures both afloat and ashore . He finally succeeds in reaching Mecca , and in returning safely home to America . The final chapter recounts the details of his death and moralizes on his life and character .</p>
   <p>The work is crude and hasty . Whole chapters of it were evidently written at one sitting . The part signed H. B. is unquestionably the best ; the prose is vigorous and the movement rapid . The only merit in Freneau 's section lies in its lyric lament at the close of one of the chapters . The hero suddenly bursts into minor song , the opening stanzas of which are :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Sweet are the flow'rs that crown the Vale</l>
     <l n="2">And sweet the spicy breathing Gale</l>
     <l n="3">That murmurs o'er the hills :</l>
     <l n="4">See how the distant lowing throng</l>
     <l n="5">Thro ’ verdant pastures move along ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or drink the Limpid Streams and crystal rills .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Ah see in yonder gloomy Grove</l>
     <l n="8">The Shepherd tells his tale of Love</l>
     <l n="9">And clasps the wanton fair :</l>
     <l n="10">While winds and trees and shades conspire</l>
     <l n="11">To fann with Love the Gentle Fire ,</l>
     <l n="12">And banish every black and boding care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">But what has Love to do with me</l>
     <l n="14">Unknown ashore , distress 'd by sea ,</l>
     <l n="15">Now hast'ning to the Tomb :</l>
     <l n="16">Whilst here I rove , and pine and weep ,</l>
     <l n="17">Sav 'd from the fury of the deep</l>
     <l n="18">To find alas on shore a harder doom .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The nature of the undergraduate work done by Princeton in Freneau 's time was thus summed up by President Witherspoon in his “ Address to the Inhabitants of Jamaica , ” published in Philadelphia in 1772 :</p>
   <p>“ In the first year they read Latin and Greek , with the Roman and Grecian antiquities , and Rhetoric . In the second , continuing the study of the languages , they learn a compleat system of Geography , with the use of the globes , the first principles of Philosophy , and the elements of mathematical knowledge . The third , though the languages are not wholly omitted , is chiefly employed in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy . And the senior year is employed in reading the higher classics , proceeding in the Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and going through a course of Moral Philosophy . In addition to these , the President gives lectures to the juniors and seniors , which consequently every Student hears twice over in his course , first , upon Chronology and History , and afterwards upon Composition and Criticism . He has also taught the French language last winter , and it will continue to be taught to all who desire to learn it . * * *</p>
   <p>“ As we have never yet been obliged to omit or alter it for want of scholars , there is a fixed Annual Commencement on the last Wednesday of September , when , after a variety of public exercises , always attended by a vast concourse of the politest company , from the different parts of this province and the cities of New York and Philadelphia . * * * ”</p>
   <p>Of Freneau 's proficiency as a student we have no record . Of the details of the Commencement of September 25 , 1771 , when he received his degree , we have but a brief account . Brackenridge opened the exercises with a salutatory , and following came four other exercises which completed the morning 's programme .</p>
   <p>The audience assembled again at three , and after singing by the students there came :</p>
   <p>“ 6 . An English forensic dispute on this question , ‘ Does ancient poetry excel the modern ? ’ Mr. Freneau , the respondent , his arguments in favor of the ancients were read . Mr. Williamson answered him and Mr. McKnight replied . ”</p>
   <p>“ 7 . A poem on ‘ The Rising Glory of America , ’ by Mr. Brackenridge , was received with great applause by the audience . ”</p>
   <p>Madison on account of ill health did not appear .</p>
   <p>The “ Rising Glory ” had been written conjointly by Brackenridge and Freneau . Although the former was given on the Commencement programme full credit for the exercise , it was surely Freneau who conceived the work and who gave it its strength and high literary value . Brackenridge in later years confessed to his son that “ on his part it was a task of labor , while the verse of his associate flowed spontaneously . ” The poem was printed in Philadelphia the following year , and in 1786 Freneau isolated his own portion for publication in the first edition of his works .</p>
   <p>This detaching of Freneau 's portion from the complete work destroyed at the outset the original unity of the piece . The changes and omissions made necessary by the process of separating the part from the whole , the deliberate readjustment of perspective to bring the poem up to the historical conditions of the later date , and the careful editing which strove to remove blemishes and weaknesses due to inexperience , combine to make the 1786 version practically a new poem .</p>
   <p>The first glimpse of Freneau after his graduation from Princeton is furnished by a letter to Madison , dated Somerset County , in Maryland , November 22 , 1772 :[ 3 ]</p>
   <p>“ If I am not wrongly informed by my memory , I have not seen you since last April , you may recollect I was then undertaking a School at Flatbush on Long Island . I did not enter upon the business it is certain and continued in it thirteen days — but — ‘ Long Island I have bid adieu , With all its bruitish , brainless crew . The youth of that detested place , Are void of reason and of grace . From Flushing hills to Flatbush plains , Deep ignorance unrivalld reigns . ’ I 'm very poetical , but excuse it . ‘ Si fama non venit ad aures , ’ — if you have not heard the rumour of this story ( which , by the by is told in various taverns and eating houses ) you must allow me to be a little prolix with it . Those who employed me were some gentlemen of New York , some of them are bullies , some merchants , and others Scoundrels : They sent me eight children , the eldest of whom was 10 years . Some could read , others spell and a few stammer over a chapter of the Bible — these were my pupils and over these was I to preside . My salary moreover was L40 ,— there is something else relating to that I shall not at present mention — after I forsook them they proscribed me for four days and swore that if I was caught in New York they would either Trounce or Maim me : but I luckily escaped with my goods to Princetown — where I remained till commencement — so much for this affair .</p>
   <p>“ I have printed a poem in New York called the American Village , containing about 450 Lines , also a few short pieces added ; I would send you one if I had a proper opportunity — the additional poems are — A Poem to the Nymph I never saw — The miserable Life of a Pedagogue — and Stanzas on an ancient Dutch house on Long Island — As to the main poem it is damned by all good and judicious judges — my name is in the title page , this is called vanity by some — but ‘ who so fond as youthful bards of fame ? ’</p>
   <p>“ I arrived at this Somerset Academy the 18th of October , and intend to remain here till next October . I am assistant to Mr. Brakenridge . This is the last time I shall enter into such a business ; it worries me to death and by no means suits my ‘ giddy , wandring brain . ’ I would go over for the gown this time two years , but the old hag Necessity has got such a prodigious gripe of me that I fear I shall never be able to accomplish it . I believe if I cannot make this out I must turn quack , and indeed I am now reading Physic at my leisure hours , that is , when I am neither sleeping , hearing classes , or writing Poetry — for these three take up all my time .</p>
   <p>“ It is now late at night , not an hour ago I finished a little poem of about 400 lines , entitled a Journey to Maryland — being the Sum of my adventures — it begins ‘ From that fam 'd town where Hudson 's flood — unites with Stream perhaps as good ; Muse has your bard begun to roam —&amp; I intend to write a terrible Satire upon certain vicious persons of quality in New York — who have also used me ill — and print it next fall it shall contain 5 or 600 lines . Sometimes I write pastorals to shew my Wit .</p>

   <p>The scene of Freneau 's new labors was the famous old school near Princess Anne , Md ., which in 1779 was incorporated as Washington Academy . Brackenridge became Master here shortly after his graduation , and in the words of his son and biographer , received “ a handsome salary . ” “ He continued here , ” says his biographer , “ during several years until the breaking out of the American Revolution , in the midst of a wealthy and highly polished society , greatly respected as a man of genius and scholarship . He used to speak with the pride of a Porson , of the Winders , the Murrays , the Parnells and others who afterward became distinguished . "[ 4 ] For many years the academy drew to it the sons of the best families of Northern Virginia , Maryland and Delaware .</p>
   <p>The length of Freneau 's stay in Maryland is uncertain . There is evidence that he remained as Second Master of the school for several years . There is a tradition in the family that it was the wish of Freneau 's father that he study divinity and that for a time he joined with Brackenridge in preparing for this profession ; and there is another , which is very persistent , that he left Maryland to study the law in Philadelphia , but I can find no positive evidence . The period between 1772 and 1775 is at best a vague one in our life of the poet .</p>
   <p>III .</p>
   <p>In the early summer of 1775 , Freneau suddenly appeared in New York as a publicist of remarkable fluency . Before November he had issued no less than eight long poems as separate publications , nearly all of them called forth by the new crisis in American affairs . Beginning with “ American Liberty , ” issued by Anderson , the editor of the new patriotic weekly , The Constitutional Gazette , he published pamphlet after pamphlet in rapid succession , all of them throwing upon Gage and the British cause in Boston all the satire and invective which he had used so mercilessly in the old society war at Princeton . Two of these were published by Hugh Gaine , and another , “ The Voyage to Boston , ” first issued by Anderson , was reprinted at once in Philadelphia . All of them have fared hardly during the years . Several , like “ General Gage 's Soliloquy , ” and “ Timothy Taurus , ” which recounts the story of a journey made by Freneau to Passaic Falls , near Paterson , New Jersey , in August , have disappeared entirely , one of them , the “ General Gage 's Confession , ” has never been republished in any form , and all the others were cut down and altered by the author for later editions until they were almost in every respect entirely new poems .</p>
   <p>That these voluminous and vigorous tirades , which their author evidently poured forth with perfect ease , were criticised and condemned by the fastidious we have no evidence . Certain it is that judging by the contemporary newspaper press they were exceedingly popular . Yet , in November we find Freneau in a sad state of discouragement , ready to give up forever all association with the muses . Some one , envious of his rising fame , has criticised him unmercifully . He seeks out the old Clio-Whig satires and after adapting and reshaping them he hurls them at the head of his enemy whom he designates as McSwiggen .</p>

   <p>Freneau had determined to spend the winter in the West Indies . He had become acquainted during the autumn with a West Indian gentleman by the name of Hanson , who owned large estates in the islands , and who sailed master of his own vessel . Upon his invitation Freneau became a passenger late in November for the Island of Santa Cruz . Early in the voyage the mate died , and the young poet , his education outweighing his inexperience in nautical matters , was chosen to fill his place . The study of navigation , made necessary by this step , doubtless turned the direction of his whole life .</p>
   <p>For the next two years Freneau made his home on Captain Hanson 's estate on the Island of Santa Cruz . A selection from one of his letters charmingly describes the spot .</p>
   <p>“ The town at the west end is but mean and ordinary , consisting of a fort and perhaps 80 or 90 wooden houses . The harbor is nothing but an open road , where , however , ships lie in the utmost security at their moorings , the bottom being good for anchorage and the wind always off shore . About two miles to the eastward of this town , along the seashore , is the estate of Capt . Hanson , into which the sea has formed a beautiful little bay , called Buttler 's Bay , about 100 yards across ; it has a sandy shore and an excellent landing , though all the rest of the shore is sharp craggy rocks . My agreeable residence at this place for above two years , off and on during the wars in America , renders the idea of it all too pleasing , and makes me feel much the same anxiety at a distance from it as Adam did after he was banished from the bowers of Eden . "[ 5 ]</p>
   <p>He seems to have been employed at intervals by Captain Hanson in voyages about the islands . Thus he records of the Island of St. James , that “ I went over July 13 , 1777 , and remained there eight days . We loaded our vessel with coral rock , which is used in these islands for burning lime of a very excellent quality . ”</p>
   <p>It was while at the ideal retreat at Butler 's Bay that Freneau wrote three of his most significant poems , “ Santa Cruz , ” “ The House of Night , ” and “ The Jamaica Funeral , ” the first two of which were contributed to the United States Magazine in 1779 . Of these the “ House of Night ” is the most significant , containing as it does evidence of a high creative power and a romantic imagination , rare indeed in English poetry in 1776 . There are evidences that Freneau composed the first draught of the poem before leaving for the West Indies , but the point is not an important one . For the edition of 1786 he nearly doubled the original version , but in 1795 he cut it down to a few stanzas , taking from it nearly everything which had made it a notable creation .</p>
   <p>On April 1 , 1778 , Freneau sailed from Santa Cruz for the Bermuda Islands , where for a time he was the guest of the English Governor . In an elaborate letter to Brackenridge , dated Bermuda , May 10 , afterward published in the United States Magazine , he describes at length the islands . “ These , ” he says in conclusion , “ are a few particulars concerning this little country where I resided upwards of five weeks , and if this slight description gives you any satisfaction , it will amply repay me for the fatigues I underwent in sailing thither . ”</p>
   <p>On June 6th he was again in Santa Cruz ; on the 15th he set out on his homeward voyage , after an absence of nearly three years . The run home was destined to be eventful . Off the Delaware capes the vessel was taken by the British , but Freneau , being a passenger , was landed on July 9th and allowed to go his way .</p>
   <p>The young poet now retired to Mount Pleasant , where doubtless he quietly remained until the autumn of the following year . In August , 1778 , he published with Bell in Philadelphia the pamphlet poem “ America Independent . ” On January 1 , 1779 , Brackenridge issued in Philadelphia the first number of the United States Magazine ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>and Freneau at once became an important contributor . His work in prose and verse may be found in nearly every number . There are prose papers on the West Indies , purporting to be extracts from the letters of “ a young philosopher and bel esprit just returned from several small voyages amongst these islands . ” There are several early poems for the first time put into print , like “ Columbus to Ferdinand ” and “ The Dying Elm , ” and there are several notable long poems , like “ Santa Cruz ” and “ The House of Night . ” At least three of the poetical contributions were written expressly for the magazine : “ George the Third 's Soliloquy , ” “ Psalm cxxxvii Imitated , ” — signed “ Monmouth , Sept. 10 , ” — and the “ Dialogue between George and Fox . ” It is evident , however , that Freneau , though his work very greatly strengthened the periodical , was only a “ valued contributor . ” The psalm in the September issue , the first of the poems to bear his name , had a foot-note explaining that the author was “ a young gentleman to whom in the course of this work we are greatly indebted . ”</p>
   <p>The United States Magazine is a notable landmark in American literary history . Its methods , as we view them to-day , seem singularly modern , and its materials and arrangement are indeed remarkable when we view them against the background of their times . It was a spirited , intensely patriotic , and highly literary periodical ; the single fact that “ The House of Night ” first appeared in its columns is enough to stamp it as no ordinary work . It died with its twelfth issue , owing to the troubled state of the country and the unsettled nature of the currency . Then , too , the audience to which it appealed was found to be a small one . In his valedictory the editor complains bitterly of the unliterary atmosphere in America . A large class , he declares , “ inhabit the region of stupidity , and cannot bear to have the tranquility of their repose disturbed by the villanous shock of a book . Reading is to them the worst of all torments , and I remember very well that at the commencement of the work it was their language , ‘ Art thou come to torment us before the time ? ’ We will now say to them , ‘ Sleep on and take your rest . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Late in September , 1779 , Freneau shipped as super-cargo on the brig Rebecca , Captain Chatham , bound for the Azores . After an exciting voyage , during which they were several times chased by British ships , they arrived at Santa Cruz , in the island of Teneriffe , where they remained two months . A part of Freneau 's notebook during this voyage has been preserved . It shows him to have been a careful and conscientious student of navigation , making each day an observation of his own and minutely tabulating his results . His cash account with the crew during the stay in the islands is interesting and suggestive .</p>
   <p>The early spring of 1780 was spent by the poet at the old home , but his mind was evidently tossing upon the ocean . He longed to visit again his beloved West Indies , and accordingly on the 25th of May he took passage at Philadelphia , in the ship Aurora , for St. Eustatia . Freneau 's account of this voyage and its after results is still extant .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>A few quotations will tell the story .</p>
   <p>“ On the 25th of May , in beating down the Delaware Bay , we unfortunately retook a small sloop from the refugees loaded with corn , which hindered us from standing out to sea that night , whereby in all probability we should have avoided the enemy which afterwards captured us .</p>
   <p>“ Friday morning , May 26 . The air very smoky and the wind somewhat faintish , though it afterward freshened up . The wind was so that we stood off E. S. E ., after putting the pilot on board the small sloop , handcuffing the prisoners , and sending the prize to Cape May . About three o'clock in the afternoon we discovered three sail bearing from us about E. N. E . ; they were not more than five leagues from us when we discovered them from the foretop ; at the same time we could see them from the quarter-deck . One appeared to be a pretty large ship , the other two brigs . We soon found they were in chase of us ; we therefore tacked immediately , set all sail we could crowd , and stood back from the bay . My advice to the officers was to stand for Egg Harbor or any part of the Jersey shore , and run the ship on the flats , rather than be taken ; but this was disregarded . We continued to stand in till we saw Cape Henlopen ; the frigate , in the meantime , gaining on us apace ; sun about half an hour high . We were abreast of the Cape , close in , when the wind took us aback , and immediately after we were becalmed ; the ebb of the tide at the same time setting very strong out of the bay , so that we rather drifted out . Our design was , if possible , to get within the road around the point , and then run the ship on shore ; but want of wind and the tide being against us , hindered from putting this into execution . We were now within three hundred yards of the shore . The frigate in the meantime ran in the bay to leeward of us about one-quarter of a mile ( her distance from the Cape hindering it from becalming her as it did us ) and began to bring her cannon to bear on us . Her two prizes hove to ; one we knew to be the brig Active , Captain Mesnard ; the other , as we afterward learned , was a Salem brig from the West Indies . The frigate was the Iris , returning from Charleston to New York , with the express of the former 's being taken . We now began to fire upon each other at the distance of about three hundred yards . The frigate hulled us several times . One shot went betwixt wind and water , which made the ship leak amazingly , making twenty-four inches in thirty minutes . We found our four-pounders were but trifles against the frigate , so we got our nine-pounder , the only one we had , pointed from the cabin windows , with which we played upon the frigate for about half an hour . At last a twelve-pound shot came from the frigate , and , striking a parcel of oars lashed upon the starboard quarter , broke them all in two , and continuing its destructive course , struck Captain Laboyteaut in the right thigh , which it smashed to atoms , tearing part of his belly open at the same time with the splinters from the oars ; he fell from the quarter-deck close by me , and for some time seemed very busily engaged in setting his legs to rights . He died about eleven the same night , and next day was sewed up in his hammock and sunk . Every shot seemed now to bring ruin with it . A lad named Steel had his arm broken and some others complained of slight wounds ; whereupon , finding the frigate ready and in a position to give us a broadside , we struck , after having held a very unequal contest with her for about an hour .... As soon as we struck , one Squires with some midshipmen came on board and took possession of the vessel . ”</p>
   <p>Freneau at first supposed that , being a passenger , he would be taken with the prize to New York and there released ; but despite his protests , he was driven into the barge with the other prisoners and taken to the Iris . All his baggage was left behind , and he was destined never to see it again . Arriving on board , the prisoners were driven between decks , where the air was hot and stifling .</p>
   <p>“ There were about one hundred prisoners forward , the stench of whom was almost intolerable . So many melancholy sights and dismal countenances made it a pretty just representation of the infernal region . I marched through a torrent of cursing and blasphemy to my station , viz ., at the blacksmith 's vice , where the miserable prisoners were handcuffed two and two . At last it came my turn . ‘ Pray , ’ said I , ‘ is it your custom to handcuff passengers ? The Americans , I am confident , never used the English so . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Are you a passenger ? ’ said the blacksmith . At the same time happening to look up , I saw Hugh Ray looking steadily at me , who immediately seized my hand , and asked me how I did . ‘ Do you know him ? ’ said Holmes , the master-at-arms . ‘ Then you are free from irons ; come over among the gentlemen . ’</p>
   <p>“ This was an unexpected deliverance from a cursed disgrace which I hardly knew how I should get clear of . After this I was used well by everybody . ”</p>
   <p>On the 29th the Iris reached New York and the common prisoners were sent to the prison ships in the harbor . Freneau , however , was retained with the officers . He had been promised his liberty at the first possible moment , but on Thursday , June 1st , at the Commissioner 's office , the charge was brought by the second mate that Freneau had been among those stationed at the guns during the fight . He was refused parole , though he promised security in any amount up to ten thousand pounds , and the same day was placed on board the Scorpion prison ship , “ lying off the college in the North River . ”</p>
   <p>Freneau 's experiences during his stay upon the Scorpion have been described by him in graphic style in his poem , “ The Prison Ship . ”</p>
   <p>“ On the night of June 4th , thirty-five of the prisoners formed a design of making their escape , in which they were favored by a large schooner accidentally alongside of us . She was one that was destined for the expedition to Elizabeth Town , and anchored just astern of us . We were then suffered to continue upon deck , if we chose , till nine o'clock . We were all below at that time except the insurgents , who rushed upon the sentries and disarmed them in a moment ; one they tied by his neck-stock to the quarter rails , and carried off his musquet with them ( they were all Hessians ) ; the rest they drove down with their arms into the cabin and rammed the sentry box down the companion in such a manner that no one could get it up or down . One , Murphy , possessed himself of Gauzoo 's silver-hilted sword , and carried it off with him . When the sentries were all silent , they manned the ship 's boat and boarded the schooner , though the people on board attempted to keep them off with handspikes . The wind blowing fresh at south and the flood of tide being made , they hoisted sail and were out of sight in a few minutes . Those particulars we learned from some who were on duty , but were unsuccessful in getting into the boat . As soon as the sentries got possession of the vessel again , which they had no difficulty in doing , as there was no resistance made , they posted themselves at each hatchway and most basely and cowardly fired fore and aft among us , pistols and musquets , for a full quarter of an hour without intermission . By the mercy of God they touched but four , one mortally .... After this no usage seemed severe enough for us . ”</p>
   <p>On June 22d , Freneau , who was weak with fever , was taken to the Hunter hospital ship , lying in the East River . Here he languished with an intermittent fever , that threatened constantly to become “ putrid ” and fatal , until July 12th , when :</p>
   <p>“ The flag came alongside and cleared the hospital ship . But the miseries we endured in getting to Elizabeth Town were many . Those that were very bad , of which the proportion was great , naturally took possession of the hold . No prisoner was allowed to go to the cabin , so that I , with twenty or thirty others , were obliged to sleep out all night , which was uncommonly cold for the season . About ten next morning we arrived at Elizabeth Town Point , where we were kept in the burning sun several hours , till the Commissary came to discharge us .</p>
   <p>“ I was afflicted with such pains in my joints , I could scarcely walk , and besides was weakened with a raging fever ; nevertheless I walked two miles to Elizabeth Town ; here I got a passage in a wagon to within a mile of Crow 's Ferry , which I walked ; got a passage over the ferry and walked on as far as Molly Budleigh 's , where I stayed all night . Next morning , having breakfasted on some bread and milk , I set homeward ; when I came to Obadiah Budleigh 's corner I turned to the right and came home round about through the woods , for fear of terrifying the neighbors with my ghastly looks had I gone through Mount Pleasant . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Some days later he despatched the following note to his friend at Santa</l>
     <l n="2">Cruz :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ SIR :— I take this opportunity to inform you that instead of arriving , as I fondly promised myself , at the fragrant groves and delectable plains of Santa Cruz , to enjoy the fruits and flowers of that happy clime , I was unfortunately taken and confined on board a prison ship at New York , and afterwards in a Hospital Ship , where the damnable draughts of a German doctor afforded far different feelings to my stomach than the juice of the orange or more nourishing milk of the cocoa . ”</p>
   <p>IV .</p>
   <p>On April 25 , 1781 , there was established in Philadelphia a new weekly newspaper , the Freeman 's Journal or North American Intelligencer , which was to be “ open to all parties but influenced by none , ” and which had for its object “ To encourage genius , to deter vice , and disrobe tyranny and misrule of every plumage . ” The proprietor and printer of this paper was Mr. Francis Bailey , who not long before had removed his office from Lancaster , Pa . The editor and ruling spirit , although his name during three years did not once appear in its columns , was Philip Freneau . The mark of the young poet is upon every page . Its opening editorial , which was from his pen , sounded a note that was not once lowered or weakened while he was in control .</p>
   <p>“ At no period of time , in no era of important events from the first establishment of social government , have the liberties of man , have the rights even of human nature , been more deeply interested than at the time in which we presume to address you . While Liberty , the noblest ornament of society , and without which no community can be well organized , seemed to pine and sicken under the trammels of despotic restraint in every one of the ancient nations of the earth , it fairly promises to resume its pristine majesty here , and the new world begins to emerge from the fangs and tyranny of the old .... One of the first sources of her decline in those countries where she last resided spring from the wanton and unhallowed restraints which the jealous arm of despotism hath imposed on the freedom of the press ....</p>
   <p>“ That freemen may be made acquainted with the real state of their affairs , and that the characters of their public servants , both individually and collectively , be made manifest , is our object . With this patriotic view , and under the tutelage of law and the constitution , has the subscriber opened a Free Press , universally free to every citizen indiscriminately , whose principles coincide with those of the Revolution , and whose object is confessedly known to point at public or private good . ”</p>
   <p>From this time until June , 1784 , Freneau resided principally in Philadelphia , and edited the journal . During all of this time his muse was exceedingly active . He followed carefully the last years of the war , and put into satiric verse every movement of the “ insolent foe . ” He sang the victory of Jones , and mourned in plaintive numbers the dead at Eutaw Springs . He voiced his indignation over the destructive career of Cornwallis , and burst into a Laus Deo at his fall . The ludicrous plight of Rivington and Gaine , the distress of the Tories , and the final departure of the British filled him with glee , which he poured out in song after song . It was his most prolific and spontaneous period .</p>
   <p>He wrote , too , an abundance of prose . The series of graceful papers entitled “ The Pilgrim ” is from his pen , besides many a political study and literary sketch signed with a sounding name . Everywhere are manifest his love of true literature and his desire to lead a merely literary life , but here and there are notes of discouragement . “ Barbers cannot possibly exist as such , ” he writes , “ among a people who have neither hair nor beards . How , then , can a poet hope for success in a city where there are not three persons possessed of elegant ideas ? ”</p>
   <p>During the year 1783 Freneau 's pen was very busy in various lines of work . It is probable that he assisted Bailey in many ways ,— writing introductions to publications issued by the office and performing the various other duties incumbent upon the literary editor of a publishing house . During this year he translated the “ New Travels through North America , ” which had just been issued by the Abbe Robin , one of the chaplains of the French Army in America , and the translation was issued first by Bailey and later by Powers and Willis of Boston . Freneau 's introduction is characteristic :</p>
   <p>“ Most of those accounts of North America , given to the public by British explorators and others , previous to the Revolution , are generally taken up , with the recitals of wonderful adventures , in the woods beyond the Lakes , or with the Histories and records of the wild Indian nations , so that by the time the reader gets through one of those performances , he never fails to be better acquainted with the Ottagnies , Chereokees , Miamees , Nadouwessians , and a hundred others , with their various customs of paw-wawing , or methods of making wampum , than with the most interesting particulars relative to the inhabitants of the then colonies these were but rarely thought worthy mentioning by those gentlemen , and when they are , it is mortifying enough to see them constantly considered as mere beasts of burden , calculated solely for the support of the grandeur , wealth and omnipotence of Great-Britain , than as men and Free-Men .</p>
   <p>“ Our French Author is more liberal — two years before the present peace he considered the United States as a great independent nation , advancing with hasty strides to the summit of power and sovereignty . ”</p>
   <p>It was during this year that the poet , for the first time , met with positive opposition and abuse . Oswald , the editor of the newly established Gazette , quarrelled with Bailey , and a poetical battle was one phase of the contest . The details of this affair will be found in the proper place , and I need not recount them here , but suffice it to say that Freneau soon found his muse assailed by the meanest of all critics . His extremely sensitive nature could brook no criticism . His Celtic temperament could fight fiercely in the presence of an open foe , but it was easily depressed and discouraged by criticism and covert attack . He lost heart in his work , and at the end of the third volume he quietly withdrew from his editorship .</p>
   <p>The three volumes of the Journal which bear his impress are notable for their vigor of policy , their high ideals , their unswerving patriotism , and their real literary merit . It is to be hoped that a selection from Freneau 's prose writings during this critical era in our history may sometime be made . Nowhere else can we gain so distinct a picture of the man , with his sanguine , impetuous temperament , his proud spirit , and his intense hatred of every form of tyranny . He wrote vigorously not only on British oppression , but on such topics as the wrongs of negro slavery , cruelty to animals , the wanton destruction of trees , the evils of intemperance , and the rights of woman .</p>
   <p>The “ Epistle to Sylvius ” was his valedictory . In it he deplores the lack of literary taste in America , and the sad fate which has befallen his youthful poetic dreams . The age is grown mercantile , and Sejanus the mighty tradesman ,—</p>

     <l n="1">“ Sejanus has in house declared</l>
     <l n="2">‘ These States , as yet , can boast no bard ,</l>
     <l n="3">And all the sing-song of our clime</l>
     <l n="4">Is merely nonsense fringed with rhyme . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A bard with more Teutonic blood , if he knew within himself that he was indeed a poet , and the only real poet of his time , would have staid at his post and made himself heard , despite narrow criticism and mean abuse , but Freneau was too proud to fight for recognition . The people had crowned him , to be sure , but if the critics , those who should be the real judges , rejected him , he would strive no longer . He would leave the field .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Then , Sylvius , come — let you and I</l>
     <l n="2">On Neptune 's aid , once more rely :</l>
     <l n="3">Perhaps the muse may still impart</l>
     <l n="4">The balm to ease the aching heart .</l>
     <l n="5">Though cold might chill and storms dismay ,</l>
     <l n="6">Yet Zoilus will be far away . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On June 24 , 1784 , Freneau sailed from Middletown Point as master of the brig Dromilly , bound for Jamaica . The voyage was indeed a memorable one . On the night of July 30 , while off the end of the island , the ship encountered a violent hurricane . According to contemporary accounts , “ No more than eight out of one hundred and fifty sail of vessels in the ports of Kingston and Port Royal were saved . ” The Dromilly survived the storm , but it was a mere wreck when the next morning it crept into Kingston Harbor .</p>
   <p>Freneau remained in Jamaica until September 24 , when he left for Philadelphia in the brig Mars , arriving November 4 . His experiences in trying to fit out the wrecked Dromilly are not recorded , but the one incident of his poetic reply to the keeper of the King 's water works , who had refused him a puncheon of water , is characteristic .</p>
   <p>From this time until 1790 , Freneau 's life is redolent of the ocean . A complete itinerary of this wandering era may be compiled from the shipping news of the various seaport newspapers , but it is useless to go into details . He was master for a time of the sloop Monmouth , plying for freight between Charleston , S. C ., New York , and Savannah . His brother Peter , in Charleston , had become a man not only of influence , but of means , and together they owned the vessel and shared its profits . For several years advertisements like this appeared in the Charleston papers :</p>
   <p>“ For freight to any part of this State or Georgia ; for charter in any free port in the West Indies , the sloop Monmouth , Philip Freneau , Master , burden about 40 tons . She is new , stanch , well-formed and draws six feet when loaded . Will carry about one hundred barrels of rice . For further particulars inquire of said master on board at Mrs. Motte 's wharf or Peter Freneau . ”</p>
   <p>On the 1st of June , 1786 , there was issued from Bailey 's press the first collected edition of Freneau 's poetry . During the entire year its author was at sea almost continuously . It is evident that he had little to do with the edition . The copy furnished to Bailey consisted of the manuscript of a few early poems , revised copies of the 1775 pamphlets , and corrected and enlarged versions of his contributions to the United States Magazine . The bulk of the book is made up of Freneau 's contributions to the Freeman 's Journal , printed seriatim and without change . The poem “ Rivington 's Confessions ” is even divided into two parts , with another poem between , as it first appeared in the paper . An index of the poetry in the first four volumes of the Journal is a nearly perfect index of the 1786 edition , after the poem “ The Prison Ship . ”</p>
   <p>Bailey wrote for the edition the following introduction :</p>
   <p>“ The pieces now collected and printed in the following sheets , were left in my hands , by the author , above a year ago , with permission to publish them whenever I thought proper . A considerable number of the performances contained in this volume , as many will recollect , have appeared at different times in Newspapers ( particularly the Freeman 's Journal ) and other periodical publications in the different States of America , during the late war , and since ; and from the avidity and pleasure with which they generally appear to have been read by persons of the best taste , the Printer now the more readily gives them to the world in their present form , ( without troubling the reader with any affected apologies for their supposed or real imperfections ) in hopes they will afford a high degree of satisfaction to the lovers of poetical wit , and elegance of expression . ”</p>
   <p>This edition is the most spontaneous and poetic of the poet 's works . In it we see Freneau before he has lost his early poetic dream , before he has become hardened by close contact with the world of affairs and the cold , practical round of political life . This and the 1788 edition contain by far the most valuable part of his poetic work .</p>
   <p>In those days before the invention of book reviews , the fate of a book turned largely upon its immediate reception by the reading public . Criticism was by word of mouth : the poems were discussed in polite circles and over the morning coffee . Thus we have nothing to quote to show how America received her bard . We know , however , that the poems were successful even beyond Bailey 's expectations . In less than five months he was out with proposals for “ an additional collection of entertaining original performances in prose and verse by Philip Freneau . ” The book was to be published as soon as five hundred subscribers could be secured , and the subscribers ’ names were to be printed at the beginning of the volume .</p>
   <p>“ Such persons as are disposed to encourage American authors ( particularly at a time when we are surfeited with stale publications retailed to us from British presses ) and are not unwilling to be known as promoters of polite literature and the fine arts in these Republican States are requested to deliver in their names . ”</p>

   <p>The second volume of poems did not appear promptly . One year after the first proposals , Bailey advertised that the book was at last in press . “ An unusual hurry of other business ( of a nature not to be postponed ) , has unavoidably delayed the printer in its publication to so late a period . ” It is notable that of the four hundred and sixty-three subscribers , two hundred and fifty , or over half , were in Charleston , S. C ., and one hundred and twenty-six in New York . Philadelphia subscribed for very few of the volumes .</p>
   <p>The printer 's advertisement was as follows :</p>
   <p>“ The following Essays and Poems , selected from some printed and manuscript papers of Mr. Freneau , are now presented to the public of the United Slates in hopes they will prove at least equally acceptable with his volume of poems published last year . Some few of the pieces in this volume have heretofore appeared in American newspapers ; but through a fatality , not unusually attending publications of that kind , are now , perhaps , forgotten ; and , at any time , may possibly never have been seen or attended to but by very few . ”</p>
   <p>Of the forty-nine poems in the volume , one , “ Slender 's Journey , ” had been published separately by Bailey early in 1787 , and nearly half of the others had first seen the light between April , 1786 , and January , 1788 , in the columns of the Freeman 's Journal . The greater number of the others were doubtless printed from the poet 's manuscripts . A few of the prose papers , like “ The Philosopher of the Forest , ” were selected from the columns of the Journal , especially from the series entitled “ The Pilgrim , ” but much of the rest was from the poet 's manuscripts now first published .</p>
   <p>In the meantime the poet was leading a stormy and adventurous career upon the sea . As master of the sloop Industry , and later of the schooner Columbia , plying irregularly on all kinds of coastwise voyages between Georgia and New York , he experienced every phase of life upon the ocean . As a sample of his adventurous career during this period , note the following letter<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>to Bailey , written from Norfolk , Va ., in the summer of 1788 :</p>
   <p>“ Norfolk , Virginia , August 6 , 1788 .</p>
   <p>“ Mr. BAILEY ,</p>
   <p>“ I have the mortification to inform you that , after leaving New-York on the 21st of July , I had the misfortune to have my vessel dismasted , thrown on her beam ends , shifted and ruined the bulk of her cargo , lost every sail , mast , spar , boat , and almost every article upon deck , on the Wednesday afternoon following , in one of the hardest gales that ever blew upon this coast . Capt . William Cannon , whom I think you know , who was going passenger with me to Charleston , and Mr. Joseph Stillwell , a lad of a reputable family in New-Jersey , were both washed overboard and drowned , notwithstanding every effort to save them . All my people besides , except one , an old man who stuck fast in one of the scuttles , were several times overboard , but had the fortune to regain the wreck , and with considerable difficulty save their lives .— As to myself , I found the vessel no longer under any guidance — I took refuge in the main weather shrouds , where indeed I saved myself from being washed into the sea , but was almost staved to pieces in a violent fall I had upon the main deck , the main-mast having given way six feet above the deck , and gone overboard — I was afterward knocked in the head by a violent stroke of the tiller , which entirely deprived me of sensation for ( I was told ) near a quarter of an hour .— Our pumps were now so choaked with corn that they would no longer work , upward of four feet of water was in the hold , fortunately our bucket was saved , and with this we went to baling , which alone prevented us from foundering in one of the most dismal nights that ever man witnessed .</p>
   <p>“ The next morning the weather had cleared away and the wind came round to the N. E. which during the gale had been E. N. E .— the land was then in sight , about 5 miles distant , latitude at noon 36-17 , I then rigged out a broken boom , and set the fore top-sail , the only sail remaining , and steered for cape Henry ; making however but very little way , the vessel being very much on one side and ready to sink with her heavy cargo of iron , besides other weighty articles . We were towed in next day , Friday , by the friendly assistance of capt . Archibald Bell , of the ship Betsey , from London — I have since arrived at this port by the assistance of a Potowmac pilot .— Nothing could exceed our distress — no fire , no candle , our beds soaked with sea water , the cabbin torn to pieces , a vast quantity of corn damaged and poisoning us to death , &amp; c. &amp; c. &amp; c. As we entered this port , on the 29th of July , the very dogs looked at us with an eye of commiseration — the negros pitied us , and almost every one shewed a disposition to relieve us . In the midst of all this vexation the crew endeavoured to keep up their spirits with a little grog , while I have recourse to my old expedient of philosophy and reflection . I have unloaded my cargo , partly damaged , partly otherwise — This day I also begin to refit my vessel , and mean to proceed back to New-York as soon as refitted , which cannot be sooner than the 25th , perhaps the 30th of this month . It is possible , however , that I may be ordered to sell the vessel here ; if so , I shall take a passage to Baltimore , and go to New-York by the way of Philadelphia , to look out for another more fortunate barque than that which I now command .</p>
   <p>Your 's &amp; c. PHILIP FRENEAU . ”</p>
   <p>I cannot forbear quoting another letter<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>written nearly a year later , since it gives us a charming glimpse of the Freneau of this period :</p>
   <p>“ Yamacraw , Savanna , March 14th , 1789 .</p>
   <p>“ SIR : Amongst a number of my good natured acquaintance , who have lately sympathized with me , on account of what they term my misfortunes , during great part of last year , I know of no one more entitled to my acknowledgments , on the occasion , than yourself . When an old woman talks of witches , ghosts , or blue devils , we naturally make an allowance for bad education , or the imbicility of intellect , occasioned by age . When one man seriously supposes another unfortunate , for the sake of two or three successive disasters , which no prudence or foresight could have avoided , the same allowance ought to be made , provided the same excuses could be assigned .</p>
   <p>“ Can you be serious , then in advising me to quit all future intercourse with an element , that has for some years , with all its dangers and losses , afforded to your humble servant attractions , far more powerful than those of Apollo ! Formerly , when I wrote poetry , most of those that attended to it , would not allow my verses to be good . I gave credit to what I deemed the popular opinion , and made a safe retreat in due time , to the solitary wastes of Neptune . I am not , however , inclined to believe people so readily now , when they alledge my vessel is not sound , and when several gentlemen , for reasons best known to themselves , and perhaps not over willing to risque the uncertainties of the world to come , effect to doubt of her ability to waft their carcases in safety .</p>
   <p>But my ambition is greatly concerned in this matter : a schooner is confided to my care , humble , indeed , when compared to those lofty piles which I have seen you so much admire , but which is , nevertheless , really capable of an European , nay of an India voyage . Read all history , ransack libraries , call tradition to your aid , search all records , examine a million of manuscripts on vellum , on parchment , on paper , on marble , on what you please , and I defy you to find the most distant hint of any poet , in any age or country , from Hesiod down to Peter Pindar , having been trusted with the controul or possession of anything fit to be mentioned or compared with the same barque , which you say , I have the misfortune to command .</p>
   <p>“ To be serious : misfortune ought to be only the topic of such men as do not think or reason with propriety , upon the nature of things . Some writer says , it is but another name for carelessness or inattention : Though that may not at all times be the case , it is in the power of every man to place himself beyond the supposed baneful influence of this inexorable deity , by assuming a dignity of mind , ( if it be not the gift of nature ) that will , in the end , get the better of the untoward events , that may frequently cross our best purposes . Indeed , the sea is the best school for philosophy ( I mean of the moral kind ) ; in thirteen or fourteen years ’ acquaintance with this element , I am convinced a man ought to imbibe more of your right genuine stoical stuff , than could be gained in half a century on shore .— I must add that , be our occupations what they may , or our fortunes what they will , there is a certain delectable , inexpressible satisfaction in now and then encountering the rubs and disasters of life , and I am entirely of the opinion which ( says Dr. Langhorne )</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Weakness wrote in Petrarch 's gentle strain ,</l>
     <l n="2">When once he own 'd at love 's unfavouring shrine</l>
     <l n="3">A thousand pleasures art not worth one pain ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I must now conclude this scrawl , with telling you , that I am receiving on board my vessel a small cargo of lumber , at a place called Yamacraw , a little above Savanna . The weather is extremely warm , I am tired of my letter , and must , of course , conclude . I do not know whether you ever mean to make a voyage to sea — if you should , thrice welcome shall you be to such accommodations as my little embarkation affords . Poets and philosophers , shall ever travel with me at a cheap rate indeed ! Not only because they are not generally men of this world , but because , even supposing the barque that bears them , should make an external exit to the bottom of the ocean , the busy world , as things go , will regret the loss of most of them very little , perhaps not at all .</p>
   <p>Your 's , &amp; c ., P. FRENEAU . ”</p>
   <p>On the 24th of April , 1789 , when Washington arrived in New York to enter upon the duties of the presidency , in the fleet that accompanied him from Elizabethtown Point was the schooner Columbia , Capt . Freneau , eight days from Charleston . In June the Columbia again entered New York Harbor , and on December 28th she was at Sunbury , Georgia . On February 12th , 1790 , Freneau arrived in New York , passenger from Middletown Point in the brig Betsy , Capt . Motley , to become editor of Child and Swaine 's New York Daily Advertiser . For several months negotiations had been pending . Every appearance of the poet in New York for a year past had been marked by a small budget of poems in the Advertiser from the pen of “ Capt . Freneau , ” but it was not until February , 1790 , that he was induced to leave his beloved Columbia and settle down to a life upon shore . The poem “ Neversink , ” written some months later , is his valedictory to the ocean .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Proud heights : with pain so often seen</l>
     <l n="2">( With joy beheld once more )</l>
     <l n="3">On your firm base I take my stand ,</l>
     <l n="4">Tenacious of the shore :</l>
     <l n="5">Let those who pant for wealth or fame</l>
     <l n="6">Pursue the watery road ;—</l>
     <l n="7">Soft sleep and ease , blest days and nights ,</l>
     <l n="8">And health , attend these favoring heights ,</l>
     <l n="9">Retirement 's blest abode . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poem “ Constantia ” may record the poet 's reasons for leaving the ocean , for on the 19th of May , 1790 , there appeared in Peter Freneau 's Charleston paper , the City Gazette , or the Daily Advertiser , the following :</p>
   <p>“ Married , on the fifteenth of April , at Middletown Point , East New Jersey , Capt . Philip Freneau to Miss Eleanor Forman , daughter of Mr. Samuel Forman , of that place . ”</p>
   <p>The Forman family with which the poet allied himself was one of great respectability and even prominence in New Jersey . Its record during the Revolution had been a conspicuous one , and its connection included the Ledyards , the Seymours , and many other prominent families . Mrs. Freneau , in the words of her daughter , “ was remarkable for her gentle , lady-like manners , amiable disposition and finely informed mind . She was affable and sprightly in her conversation , and there were , even when she had reached the advanced age of eighty-seven , few handsomer women . ” In her early years she dabbled a little in poetry herself , and there is a tradition in the family that the prenuptial correspondence was for a long time wholly in verse .</p>
   <p>Freneau was now fairly settled in life , and for the next seven or eight years he was engaged almost continuously in newspaper work .</p>
   <p>V .</p>
   <p>During the next year and more Freneau , as editor of the Daily Advertiser , brought to bear upon the paper all the vigor and literary skill which had so marked the Freeman 's Journal . The tone of the editorial comment was patriotic and spirited . The note of reform , of opposition to everything that was degrading to high ideals , or that in any way threatened personal liberty , was never absent . Despite the manifold duties incumbent upon the editor of a city daily , he found time to write finished prose sketches and to woo the muses . His poetry of this period is notable both as to quantity and quality . Some of it was drawn from the notebooks of his years of wandering , but the greater part dealt with more timely topics . In June he published the advertisement :</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Freneau proposes publishing a volume of original poems , to contain about two hundred and fifty pages , 12mo , neatly printed .... As soon as there appears a sufficiency of subscribers to defray the expenses of paper and printing , the collection shall be put to press . ”</p>
   <p>Judging from several poems of this period which were printed as from the author 's new volume , “ The Rising Empire , ” this was to be the title of the book . The advertisement was dropped in October , and “ The Rising Empire ” never appeared , though most of its poems were printed in the edition of 1795 .</p>
   <p>On September 20 , 1791 , Freneau 's daughter , Eleanor , was born at Mount Pleasant . His salary as editor of the Advertiser was not large ; the little family , it appears , was in straightened circumstances . A letter<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>from Aedanus Burke of Charleston to Madison , dated September 13 , 1801 , throws light upon the period .</p>
   <p>“ I remember , it was about the last fortnight that we served together in Congress , in 1791 , I one day called you aside , and mentioned the name of Mr. Phillip Freneau to you , as one I knew you esteemed , and then lay strugling under difficulties , with his family . My memory brings to my recollection , that you mentioned the matter to the Secretary of State , Mr. Jefferson . Freneau was invited from N. York , and had the place of interpreter , with a mere trifle of Salary . Little did William Smith know , that you were the author or cause of bringing Freneau from New York ; or he might have turned against you , his terrible battery of the slanders and invectives which he poured forth against Mr. Jefferson for three or four years afterwards . ”</p>
   <p>Madison acted promptly . On the 28th of February , 1791 , Jefferson wrote to Freneau as follows :</p>
   <p>“ SIR : The clerkship for foreign languages in my office is vacant the salary indeed is very low , being but two hundred &amp; fifty dollars a year ; but also it gives so little to do as not to interfere with any other calling the person may chuse , which would not absent him from the seat of government . I was told a few days ago that it might perhaps be convenient to you to accept it — if so , it is at your service . It requires no other qualification than a moderate knowledge of the French . Should anything better turn up within my department that might suit you , I should be very happy to bestow it as well . Should you conclude to accept the present , you may consider it as engaged to you , only be so good as to drop me a line informing me of your resolution . I am with great esteem , Sir , Your very humble serv't , TH . JEFFERSON . ”</p>
   <p>Freneau 's letter in reply has been lost . On May 1st , however , Madison wrote Jefferson , so that we may gather its import :</p>
   <p>“ I have seen Freneau also and given him a line to you . He sets out for Philada . today or tomorrow , though it is not improbable that he may halt in N. Jersey . He is in the habit , I find , of translating the Leyden Gazette and consequently must be fully equal to the task you have alloted for him . He had supposed that besides this degree of skill , it might be expected that he should be able to translate with equal propriety into French : and under this idea , his delicacy had taken an insuperable objection to the undertaking . Being now set right as to this particular and being made sensible of the advantages of Philada . over N. Jersey for his private undertaking , his mind is taking another turn ; and if the scantiness of his capital should not be a bar , I think he will establish himself in the former . At all events he will give his friends there an opportunity of aiding his decision by their information &amp; counsel . The more I learn of his character , talents and principles , the more I should regret his burying himself in the obscurity he had chosen in N. Jersey . It is certain that there is not to be found in the whole catalogue of American Printers , a single name that can approach towards a rivalship . ”</p>
   <p>Jefferson replied on May 9th :</p>
   <p>“ Your favor of the 1st came to hand on the 3d . Mr. Freneau has not followed it . I suppose therefore he has changed his mind back again , for which I am really sorry . ”</p>
   <p>That Jefferson had made overtures to Freneau about the establishing of a paper at the seat of government , or at least had discussed the matter with those who had , is evident from the following letter written to his son-in-law , Randolph , six days later :</p>
   <p>“ I enclose you Bache 's as well as Fenno 's papers . You will have perceived that the latter is a paper of pure Toryism , disseminating the doctrines of Monarchy , aristocracy , &amp; the exclusion of the people . We have been trying to get another weekly or half weekly set up , excluding advertisements , so that it might go through the states &amp; furnish a whig vehicle of intelligence . We hoped at one time to have persuaded Freneau to set up here , but failed . ”</p>
   <p>It is a testimonial to the energy and the ability of Freneau that leaders like Madison and Jefferson should have sought him so persistently . Notwithstanding Freneau 's refusal , Jefferson , on July 21st , wrote to Madison :</p>
   <p>“ I am sincerely sorry that Freneau has declined coming here . Tho ’ the printing business be sufficiently full here , yet I think he would have set out on such advantageous ground as to have been sure of success . His own genius in the first place is so superior to that of his competitors . I should have given him the perusal of all my letters of foreign intelligence &amp; all foreign newspapers ; the publication of all proclamations &amp; other public notices within my department , &amp; the printing of the laws , which added to his salary would have been a considerable aid . Besides this , Fenno 's being the only weekly , or half weekly paper , &amp; under general condemnation for its toryism &amp; its incessant efforts to overturn the government , Freneau would have found that ground as good as unoccupied . ”</p>
   <p>This being brought to Freneau 's attention , he determined to hold out no longer . On July 25th he wrote to Madison from Middletown Point :</p>
   <p>“ Some business detains me here a day or two longer from returning to New York . When I come , which I expect will be on Thursday , if you should not have left the City , I will give you a decisive answer relative to printing my paper at the Seat of Govt . instead of in N. York . If I can get Mr. Childs to be connected with me on a tolerable plan , I believe I shall sacrifice other considerations and transfer myself to Philadelphia . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Francis Childs , who was one of the proprietors of the Advertiser , as we have already seen , agreed to the enterprise , and the following document was soon signed :</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>“ DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF THE UNITED STATES .</head>
    <head>“ Philip Freneau is hereby appointed Clerk for foreign languages in the office of Secretary of State with a salary of two hundred &amp; fifty dollars a year , to commence from the time he shall take the requisite oaths of qualification . Given under my hand and seal this 16th day of August 1791 . TH . JEFFERSON . ”</head>
     <l n="1">I have considered this episode somewhat minutely since it throws light</l>
     <l n="2">upon what follows .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The first number of The National Gazette appeared on Monday , October 31st . It was issued Mondays and Thursdays . Its typography and arrangement were neat and attractive ; its news columns were well filled , and its literary department was carefully attended to . Its success was all that had been predicted by Madison . On May 7 , 1792 , the editor announced that the subscription to the Gazette had succeeded beyond his most sanguine expectations .</p>
   <p>The period covered by the two years of the National Gazette was one of singular unrest in America . The French Revolution was in progress ; everything seemed tottering . America believed that all Europe was soon to cast off its chains of monarch ; she believed that the torch of the Rights of Man had been lighted in America , and she looked with almost paternal interest on the progress of the Revolution . In his poetical salutatory in the first number of the Gazette , Freneau writes :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ From the spark that we kindled , a flame has gone forth</l>
     <l n="2">To astonish the world and enlighten mankind :</l>
     <l n="3">With a code of new doctrines the universe rings ,</l>
     <l n="4">And Paine is addressing strange sermons to Kings . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The columns of the Gazette are full of ringing words on the Rights of Man , the Age of Reason , the final doom of monarchy . In poem after poem the editor pours out his sympathy for republicanism and the cause of the French insurgents . That the French had been largely instrumental in the gaining of our own independence , increased the interest . “ On the Fourteenth of July , ” “ On the French Republicans , ” “ On the Anniversary of the Storming of the Bastile , ” “ Ode to Liberty , ” and “ Demolition of the French Monarchy , ” are a few of the poems that Freneau poured forth during this incendiary period . It is significant that he included none of these verses in his edition of 1809 . That he was honest to the core in his belief cannot for a moment be doubted . His impulsive Celtic temperament threw his whole soul into his work .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Ah ! while I write , dear France allied ,</l>
     <l n="2">My ardent wish I scarce restrain ,</l>
     <l n="3">To throw these sybil leaves aside</l>
     <l n="4">And fly to join you on the main . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The frenzy among the American Republicans culminated with the arrival of</l>
     <l n="6">Citizen Genet , in 1793 . At the Republican dinner given Genet , May 18th ,</l>
     <l n="7">Citizen Freneau was elected by acclamation to translate Pichon 's ode . On</l>
     <l n="8">June 1st , at the civic feast , Freneau 's ode , “ God Save the Rights of</l>
     <l n="9">Man , ” was received with thunderous applause .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>One must study carefully this incendiary period of Freneau 's life before he can understand fully the much discussed episode of the National Gazette . The wine of French Republicanism was sadly intoxicating . It could make Freneau write such a stanza as this :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Virtue , Order and Religion ,</l>
     <l n="2">Haste , and seek some other region ;</l>
     <l n="3">Your plan is fixed to hunt them down ,</l>
     <l n="4">Destroy the mitre , rend the gown ,</l>
     <l n="5">And that vile b-tc-h — Philosophy — restore ,</l>
     <l n="6">Did ever paper plan so much before ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And then explain it by saying that “ The National Gazette is the vehicle of party spleen and opposition to the great principles of order , virtue and religion . ”</p>
   <p>In view of all this , it is not strange that he should have been impatient with the conservative party , who not only did not grow enthusiastic over the French Revolution , but even looked upon it with actual disapprobation . From the very first , the editor of the Gazette criticised the leading Federalists , especially Adams and Hamilton , and he even mildly rebuked Washington , the hero of his earlier muse . The administration , in his mind , was leaning toward monarchial ideas . Washington , in his opinion , had exceeded his power in the matter of the banks , and the precedent was a dangerous one . The ceremonials with which the President had hedged himself about were greatly at variance with simple democratic ideas ; and , to crown all , the ingratitude of the administration ( to the extremists it could have no other name ) in its attitude toward Genet and the French people hurt him deeply . I believe that Freneau was fundamentally honest in his position . It is almost impossible to believe that a note like this , in the Jersey Chronicle of 1795 , is not sincere :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The conduct of the Federal Executive of this country toward the</l>
     <l n="2">Republic of France , so far as it may appear inimical , has given</l>
     <l n="3">great and general disgust to the citizens of the United States ....</l>
     <l n="4">It would be well if some that might be mentioned would recollect</l>
     <l n="5">the nation that supported us in the late war when our infant</l>
     <l n="6">Republic was on the point of annihilation . Enmity to France is</l>
     <l n="7">treason against Republicanism . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In regard to Adams , who had danced at the King 's ball in a scarlet suit , and Hamilton , the father of the Federalists , Freneau had no scruples . The attacks of the Gazette became more and more pointed with every issue , though much of the more incendiary matter was not from Freneau 's pen . The “ Probationary Odes , ” for instance , attributed to him by contemporary enemies , and in later years quoted by Buckingham and Duyckinck as from his pen , were written by St. George Tucker . They were published in book form by Tucker in 1796 . In the sensitive state of party politics at this time , such frank criticism could not fail to raise a tempest of rebuttal and of counter abuse . It was soon noted that the Gazette , in its attacks upon the administration , spared the State department . Jefferson was never mentioned except for praise . The inference was obvious : either he had “ muzzled ” the paper by granting it certain favors , or he was making use of it as a weapon against the very administration of which he was a member .</p>
   <p>Hamilton naturally inclined toward the latter view , and much bitterness was the result . On July 25 , 1792 , he inserted this anonymous bit in Fenno 's Gazette of the United States , the Federalist organ :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The Editor of the National Gazette receives a salary from</l>
     <l n="2">Government :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Quere — Whether this salary is paid him for translations ; or for publications , the design for which is to vilify those to whom the voice of the people has committed the administration of our public affairs — to oppose the measures of Government , and , by false insinuations , to disturb the public peace ?</p>
   <p>“ In common life it is thought ungrateful for a man to bite the hand that puts bread in his mouth ; but if the man is hired to do it , the case is altered . T. L . ”</p>
   <p>This was the beginning of a series of anonymous attacks in the Federalist newspaper , written undoubtedly by Hamilton . A second article , still more definite , appeared on August 4th . In it the writer directly charged Jefferson with being the soul and spirit of the National Gazette . “ Mr. Freneau was thought a fit instrument , ” and so was deliberately engaged ; he was simply the “ faithful and devoted servant of the head of a party from whose hands he received a boon . ” The article then proceeds at length to arraign Jefferson and to appeal to the American people , whether they will consent to see the precious legacies which are theirs “ frittered away ” in so shameless a manner .</p>
   <p>This attack called forth ( from Freneau ) an affidavit which was printed in the Gazette , August 8 , 1792 :</p>
   <p>“ Personally appeared before me , Matthew Clarkson , Mayor of the City of Philadelphia , Philip Freneau , of the City of Philadelphia , who , being duly sworn , doth depose and say , That no negociation was ever opened with him by Thomas Jefferson , Secretary of State , for the establishment or institution of the National Gazette : that the deponent 's coming to the City of Philadelphia , as publisher of a Newspaper , was at no time urged , advised , or influenced by the above officer , but that it was his own voluntary act ; and that the said Gazette , nor the Editor thereof , was ever directed , controuled , or attempted to be influenced , in any manner , either by the Secretary of State , or any of his friends ; nor was a line ever , directly or indirectly , written , dictated , or composed for it by that officer , but that the Editor has consulted his own judgment alone in the conducting of it — free — unfettered — and uninfluenced .</p>
   <p>“ PHILIP FRENEAU .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sworn the 6th August , 1772 , before</l>
     <l n="2">“ MATTHEW CLARKSON , Mayor . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Hamilton followed , August 11th , with another article . He emphatically discredited Freneau 's oath , declaring that “ facts spoke louder than words , and under certain circumstances louder than oaths ; ” that “ the editor of the National Gazette must not think to swear away their efficacy ; ” that “ if he was truly , as they announced , the pensioned tool of the public character who had been named , no violation of truth in any shape ought to astonish ; equivocations and mental reservations were the too common refuge of minds struggling to escape from disgraceful imputations . ” The article then proceeded to show that Jefferson did really establish the Gazette through a particular friend .</p>
   <p>Freneau at once declined to answer further the attacks , on the ground that they were mere “ personal charges , ” and Hamilton promptly branded this as “ a mere subterfuge . ” Thus Freneau found himself in the midst of a perfect hornet 's nest of partisan strife that involved the country from end to end . The Federal organ continued its attacks , and Freneau , always restive under criticism , increased in bitterness .</p>
   <p>On September 9 , 1792 , Jefferson put himself on record in a letter to Washington .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>The letter is extremely long , since it covers the entire contest with Hamilton from the beginning . In it he declared :</p>
   <p>“ While the Government was at New York I was applied to on behalf of Freneau to know if there was any place within my department to which he could be appointed . I answered there were but four clerkships , all of which I found full , and continued without any change . When we removed to Philadelphia , Mr. Pintard , the translating clerk , did not choose to remove with us . His office then became vacant . I was again applied to there for Freneau , and had no hesitation to promise the clerkship for him . I cannot recollect whether it was at the same time , or afterwards , that I was told he had a thought of setting up a newspaper there . But whether then , or afterwards , I considered it a circumstance of some value , as it might enable me to do , what I had long wished to have done , that is , to have the material parts of the Leyden Gazette brought under your eye , and that of the public , in order to possess yourself and them of a juster view of the affairs of Europe than could be obtained from any other public source . This I had ineffectually attempted through the press of Mr. Fenno , while in New York , selecting and translating passages myself at first , then having it done by Mr. Pintard , the translating clerk , but they found their way too slowly into Mr. Fenno 's papers . Mr. Bache essayed it for me in Philadelphia , but his being a daily paper , did not circulate sufficiently in the other States . He even tried , at my request , the plan of a weekly paper of recapitulation from his daily paper , in hopes , that that might go into the other States , but in this too we failed . Freneau , as translating clerk , and the printer of a periodical paper likely to circulate through the States ( uniting in one person the parts of Pintard and Fenno ) revived my hopes that the thing could at length be effected . On the establishment of his paper , therefore , I furnished him with the Leyden Gazettes , with an expression of my wish that he could always translate and publish the material intelligence they contained , and have continued to furnish them from time to time , as regularly as I received them . But as to any other direction or indication of my wish how his press should be conducted , what sort of intelligence he should give , what essays encourage , I can protest , in the presence of Heaven that I never did by myself , or any other , or indirectly , say a syllable , nor attempt any kind of influence . I can further protest , in the same awful presence , that I never did , by myself , or any other , directly or indirectly , write , dictate or procure any one sentence or sentiment to be inserted in his , or any other gazette , to which my name was not affixed , or that of my office .... Freneau 's proposition to publish a paper , having been about the time that the writings of Publicola , and the discourses on Davila , had a good deal excited the public attention , I took for granted from Freneau 's character , which had been marked as that of a good Whig , that he would give free place to pieces written against the aristocratical and monarchial principles these papers had inculcated . This having been in my mind , it is likely enough I may have expressed it in conversation with others , though I do not recollect that I did . To Freneau I think I could not , because I had still seen him but once , and that at a public table , at breakfast , at Mrs. Elsworth 's , as I passed through New York the last year . And I can safely declare that my expectations looked only to the chastisement of the aristocratical and monarchial writers , and not to any criticisms on the proceedings of Government . Colonel Hamilton can see no motive for any appointment , but that of making a convenient partisan . But you , sir , who have received from me recommendations of a Rittenhouse , Barlow , Paine , will believe that talents and science are sufficient motives with me in appointments to which they are fitted ; and that Freneau , as a man of genius , might find a preference in my eye to be a translating clerk , and make good title to the little aids I could give him as the editor of a gazette , by procuring subscriptions to his paper , as I did some before it appeared , and as I have with pleasure done for the labors of other men of genius . I hold it to be one of the distinguishing excellences of elective over hereditary successions , that the talents which nature has provided in sufficient proportion , should be selected by the society for the government of their affairs , rather than this should be transmitted through the loins of knaves and fools , passing from the debauches of the table to those of the bed . Colonel Hamilton , alias ‘ Plain Facts , ’ says , that Freneau 's salary began before he resided in Philadelphia . I do not know what quibble he may have in reserve on the word ‘ residence . ’ He may mean to include under that idea the removal of his family ; for I believe he removed himself before his family did , to Philadelphia . But no act of mine gave commencement to his salary before he so far took up his abode in Philadelphia , as to be sufficiently in readiness for the duties of the office . As to the merits or demerits of his paper , they certainly concern me not . He and Fenno are rivals for the public favor . The one courts them by flattery , the other by censure , and I believe it will be admitted that the one has been as servile , as the other severe . But is not the dignity , and even decency of Government committed , when one of its principal ministers enlists himself as an anonymous writer or paragraphist for either the one or the other of them ? No government ought to be without censors ; and where the press is free , no one ever will . If virtuous , it need not fear the fair operation of attack and defence . Nature has given to man no other means of sifting out the truth either in religion , law , or politics . I think it as honorable to the Government neither to know , nor notice , its sycophants or censors , as it would be undignified and criminal to pamper the former and persecute the latter . "[ 12 ]</p>
   <p>But if the National Gazette concerned Jefferson not at all , as he alleged , it certainly did exasperate Washington . Later on , when the Genet affair had urged Freneau into still greater excesses , Washington , on the 23d of May , 1793 , had a conversation with Jefferson , which the latter recorded in his Ana :</p>
   <p>“ He [ the President ] adverted to a piece in Freneau 's paper of yesterday , he said he despised all their attacks on him personally , but that there never had been an act of the government , not meaning in the Executive line only , but in any line , which that paper had not abused . He had also marked the word republic thus —— where it was applied to the French republic [ see the original paper ] . He was evidently sore &amp; warm , and I took his intention to be that I should interpose in some way with Freneau ; perhaps withdraw his appointment of translating clerk to my office . But I will not do it . His paper has saved our constitution , which was galloping fast into monarchy , &amp; has been checked by no one means so powerfully as by that paper . It is well and universally known , that it has been that paper which has checked the career of the monocrats , &amp; the President , not sensible of the designs of the party , has not with his usual good sense and sang froid , looked on the efforts and effects of this free press and seen that , though some bad things have passed through it to the public , yet the good have preponderated immensely . "[ 13 ]</p>
   <p>Washington even brought the affair into a meeting of the Cabinet , declaring , according to Jefferson 's Ana , that ,</p>
   <p>“ That rascal , Freneau , sent him three copies of his paper every day as if he thought he ( Washington ) would become the distributor of them ; that he could see in this nothing but an impudent design to insult him ; he ended in a high tone . "[ 14 ]</p>
   <p>The National Gazette published its last issue , October 23 , 1793 . The collapse of the Genet bubble — the revulsion of feeling after the Frenchman had threatened to appeal from Washington to the people , brought on a tidal wave which swept away all the idols of French Republicanism in America , and the National Gazette could not withstand the tide . Subscribers withdrew their subscriptions at a ruinous rate , the notes of the proprietors were protested , and the paper was abandoned . Freneau had no idea , however , of final surrender . His last word was a promise which , however , was never fulfilled .</p>
   <p>“ With the present number concludes the second volume and second year 's publication of the National Gazette . Having just imported on his own account a considerable quantity of new and elegant printing types from Europe , it is the editor 's intention to resume the publication of this paper in a short time and previous to the meeting of Congress in December next . ”</p>
   <p>It is upon this episode that the reputation of Freneau among the generality of people chiefly rests . “ That rascal Freneau ” is the epithet that has clung to his name through all the intervening century . It is this one affair , more than anything else , that has kept him from the recognition he deserves , both as a patriot and a poet . The attitude of New England may be expressed in the words of President Dwight , written during the summer of 1793 :</p>
   <p>“ Freneau , your printer , linguist , &amp; c ., is regarded here as a mere incendiary , or rather as a despicable tool of bigger incendiaries , and his paper as a public nuisance . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Letters might be multiplied in showing the same spirit in all of the</l>
     <l n="2">Federalists .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It must not be forgotten , however , that Freneau acted from pure and honest motives ; that the excitement and bitter partisanship of the period were extraordinary , and that the air was heavily charged with the subtle magnetism that in France had created a reign of terror . It cannot be denied that Freneau went to excess in his denunciations ; but so did Hamilton , who in reality began the conflict ; so did Jefferson ; so did many others . As to the extent to which Jefferson went in subsidizing the Gazette for his own use , the reader may judge for himself . Neither side is free from blame ; Freneau is certainly no more culpable than the others who held far higher positions than he . It is but justice to say of Freneau , in the words of Jefferson 's biographer , Randall —</p>
   <p>“ He was always a warm , and after the period of which we write , became a violent partisan . It is but justice to his memory , however , to say that his honor and his veracity as a man were never questioned by those who knew him , and that his reputation in these particulars is now as free from all taint of suspicion as is that of any of the distinguished gentlemen whose names were associated with his in the controversy . ”</p>
   <p>The following words of Madison , taken from Mr. Trist 's memoranda of a conversation , May 25 , 1827 , and published in Tucker 's Life of Jefferson , probably presents the affair in its true light :</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Madison said : ‘ Freneau 's paper was another cause of soreness in General Washington . Among its different contributors , some were actuated by over-heated zeal , and some , perhaps , by malignity . Every effort was made in Fenno 's paper , and by those immediately around him ( Washington ) to impress on his mind a belief that this paper had been got up by Mr. Jefferson to injure him and oppose the measures of his administration . Freneau himself was an old College mate of mine , a poet and man of literary and refined tastes , knowing nothing of the world . He was a French scholar , and employed at first as translator . Henry Lee , who was also his College mate , and had also a friendly feeling for him , was the more immediate cause of his establishing a paper . Our main object in encouraging it , was to provide an antidote against Fenno 's paper , which was devoted to monarchy , and had begun to publish extracts from Mr. Adams 's book . I used occasionally to throw in an article , all of which I have marked , and some of which I have shown you , with a view chiefly to counteract the monarchial spirit and partisanship of the British government which characterized Fenno 's paper . I never engaged in the party criminations . ’ ”</p>
   <p>It deserves mention that Freneau stuck to his post during the yellow fever epidemic of 1793 , and that for weeks he was the only active editor in the city . On October 1st he resigned his position as translator , and soon after removed to his old home at Mount Pleasant . For a time he was without employment . He contemplated several newspaper enterprises . He evidently took steps toward the publication of a paper in Monmouth County , New Jersey , as the following advertisement , published in the Jersey Chronicle , May 30 , 1795 , would show :</p>
   <p>“ A number of persons in Freehold and other parts of Monmouth subscribed last year to a paper the editor then proposed to set on foot . As various causes delayed him prosecuting his intended purpose until the present spring , and as he supposes , many of them might in the meantime have engaged with other printers , he hopes they will if possible transfer their subscription to the Chronicle . ”</p>
   <p>On November 2 , 1794 , he writes Madison , recommending his old friend Bailey for the office of public printer , and on May 6th following , he received a reply :</p>
   <p>“ I delayed acknowledging your favour long ago received , until I could inform you of the prospects of Mr. Bailey in whose favor it was written . I have now the pleasure to tell you that although his wishes are not to be immediately fulfilled he is looking to obtain under the auspices of Mr. Beckley and Mr. Randolph a share of employment hereafter which may be very valuable to him . I congratulate you on the public intelligence just received from Holland which gives joy to all true Republicans , and wish you all the private happiness which an exchange of your former travelled scenes for the shade and tranquility of your present life can afford . Remember , however , as you have not chosen any longer to labor in the field of politics it will be expected by your friends that you cultivate with the more industry your inheritance on Parnassus . ”</p>
   <p>On May the 20th following , Freneau continued the correspondence :</p>
   <p>“ My respected friend : By some accident your kind letter of April 6th was a long time in finding its way hither , having not come to hand till the 17th inst . I sincerely thank you for the interest you have taken in Mr. Bailey . He is a good Republican and a worthy honest man , which qualifications , I have thought , entitled him to some notice from the Government , in his line of business — I was heartily laughed at , however , a few weeks ago in N. York , by some Aristocrats , for having in my Letter to you or Mr. Beckley , I forget which , extolled his Military services in the late War — I am sensible he never cut off the heads of Giants or drove hosts before him , as some have done ; at the same time it ought to be remembered that he was an officer in the Pennsylvania Militia in the season that tried men 's souls ( as Paine says ) and I believe never acted otherwise than became the character in which he acted .—</p>
   <p>I meet you at least half way in your congratulations on the public intelligence received from Holland . It is but another step toward the advancement and completion of that great and philanthropic System which I have been anticipating for many years , and which you as well as myself , I hope , will live to see realized — When I first went to reside in Philada . in 1791 I wished to be one of those who would have the honour and happiness of announcing these great events to the public through the medium of a newspaper : A variety of circumstances however , needless to trouble you with , urged my departure from that city after completing a two years publication — As I mean to pass the remainder of my days on a couple of hundred of acres of an old sandy patrimony , I have , by the way of filling up the vacuities of time set on foot a small weekly Newspaper calculated for the part of the country in which I am . Should you have any curiosity to see it I will forward it to you free of all expence except that of postage . I will not make high promises in regard to what it may contain . It will scarcely be expected that in a rude barbarous part of the country I could calculate it for the polite taste of Philadelphia .— Should your fixed residence be in Philada . I can transmit the papers to you once a week by the Public Post , who stops every Wednesday at my door . A Letter put into the Post Office at Philadelphia on Saturday morning , will be sure to reach me on Wednesday .— The public papers some time ago announced your Marriage .— I wish you all possible happiness with the lady whom you have chosen for your Companion through life — Mrs. Freneau joins me in the same , and desires me to present her best respects to your lady and yourself — and should you ever take an excursion to these parts of Jersey , we will endeavour to give Mrs. Madison and yourself — ‘ if not a costly welcome , yet a kind . ’ ”</p>
   <p>The Jersey Chronicle , an eight-paged paper of the size of a sheet of letter paper , issued its initial number from the editor 's little office at Mount Pleasant , Saturday , May 2 , 1795 . It bore the motto , “ Inter Sylvas Academi quaerere verum .— Hor . ; ” and its object , in the words of its editor , was “ to present ... a complete history of the foreign and domestic events of the Times , together with such essays , remarks , and observations as shall tend to illustrate the politics , or mark the general character of the age and country in which we live . ” The editor 's salutatory is characteristic of its author :</p>
   <p>“ Never was there a more interesting period than the present , nor ever was there a time within the reach of history when mankind have been so generally united in attending to the cultivation of the mind , examining into the natural and political rights of nations , and emancipating themselves from those shackles of despotism which have so long impeded the happiness of the human species , and rendered the rights of the many subservient to the interests of the few .</p>
   <p>“ At this time , when new Republics are forming and new Empires bursting into birth ; when the great family of mankind are evidently making their egress from the dark shadows of despotism which have so long enveloped them , &amp; are assuming a character suitable to the dignity of their species , the Editor seizes the opportunity to renew his efforts for contributing , in some small degree , to the general information of his fellow citizens in the present history and politics of the world . No pains shall be spared , on his part , to procure the best , the most authentic , and earliest intelligence from every quarter , and circulating it by every method and means in his power ; and to whatever parts his subscription will enable him to do it .</p>
   <p>“ When it is considered that few Advertisements are reasonably to be expected in these more eastern parts of New-Jersey , the terms of subscription will appear low , and , it may be added , are within the power of almost every man who has the will and inclination to encourage literature , promote the interests , or enlarge the ideas of the rising generation , and contribute to the general diffusion of knowledge among his fellow citizens .</p>
   <p>“ Should the publication of The Jersey Chronicle be suitably encouraged , the Editor will in due time enlarge the size of the sheet ; but that now published on is , in his opinion , every way adequate to an experiment whether the attempt be practicable or not . ”</p>
   <p>Freneau 's essays contributed to the Chronicle are among the most notable prose productions from his pen . He began a series of studies “ On Monarchial and Mixed Forms of Government ; ” he wrote “ Observations on Monarchy , ” and discussed at length the leading arguments for and against Jay 's Treaty with England . On May 23d he began to publish a series of papers entitled “ Tomo Cheeki , the Creek Indian in Philadelphia , ” in which the manners and absurdities of the Americans are described from the standpoint of an observant savage . In nearly every issue of the paper there was an elaborate essay on some political subject . Of poetry there was very little . The National Gazette had contained little poetry from the editor 's pen , save earlier verses reprinted , and a few political satires and republican lyrics . The influence of Peter Pindar was becoming more and more manifest in the poet 's style . Politics and party strife had for a time displaced the muse . This is nowhere more evident than in the collected edition of his poems printed on his own press and issued in June , 1795 .</p>
   <p>In many respects this is the most interesting of Freneau 's collections : it brings us into the very presence of the poet . The earlier editions had been published without his supervision , the material for this one passed all of it under the author 's critical eye . Scarcely a poem escaped revision . After noting the scrupulous care with which he changed adjectives , improved rhymes , added new stanzas , or cut out old ones , repunctuated sentences , and rearranged material , one cannot join the somewhat large band of hasty and superficial critics who allude flippantly to the poet as a hasty and careless improviser of ephemeral trash . As a matter of fact , Freneau was a miser with his verses . When a newspaper poem suspected to be his , especially in the period previous to 1795 , cannot be found in any of his collections , grave doubts at once arise as to whether the poem is his . He was never tired of revising , and cutting , and pruning . The poems so carefully edited in 1795 were again carefully revised in 1809 . As an instance of his concern for the fate of his poems let me quote a letter , written August 29 , 1781 , to Matthew Carey :</p>
   <p>“ I see by this day 's paper that my verses on General Washington 's arrival , etc ., are to appear in your next Museum . If it is not too late , I would request the favour of you to rectify an error ( which was entirely of the press ) in the fifth line of the thirteenth stanza , as it materially affects the sense . Instead of ‘ whom ’ please to read ‘ who . ’ ”</p>
   <p>The 1795 edition is interesting from another standpoint . The resources of the little country office were taxed to the utmost in the production of the book . At best it is a crude piece of printing . There is manifest everywhere an effort to keep the work within bounds , to economize space . Titles are abbreviated , mottoes dropped , foot notes cut out , and many earlier poems reduced , or omitted entirely . The list of omissions is very suggestive : scenes one and two were cut from the “ Pictures of Columbus , ” the long song of Ismenius was dropped from “ The Monument of Phaon , ” “ The Jamaica Funeral , ” and “ The House of Night ” were reduced to mere fragments , “ Female Frailty ” was dropped save for the opening lyric , and there were other notable changes . In every case it will be found that the poet threw overboard the light and imaginative element , the purely poetic .</p>
   <p>The reason for these omissions has been often sought . Prof. C. F. Richardson in particular has wondered at the dropping of the intensely original and weirdly strong poem “ The House of Night , ” — in his opinion the best thing Freneau ever did . It is not difficult to answer the question after a careful study of the evolution of Freneau 's poetic ideals . He began to write poetry after a thorough course of reading in the Latin and English classics . His early work is redolent of Virgil 's “ Eclogues , ” of Horace , of Shakespeare , of Milton 's minor poems , of Gray 's “ Elegy . ” If ever there was a sensitive , beauty-loving , poetic soul , the young Freneau was one . In his early inexperience he even dreamed of a poetic career in which he might perhaps win a place beside the great masters of song . His early work like the “ Ode to Fancy , ” and similar pieces , and the strong and original “ House of Night ” and “ Santa Cruz ” show what he might have done in another environment .</p>
   <p>But Revolutionary America had little encouragement for an imaginative poet . There was something in the air that seemed to put into men the Franklin spirit . It was the era of common-sense , of stern reality , of practical affairs . Madison voiced the age when in 1774 he advised Bradford , the cultured and imaginative young lover of poetry and all art , to turn to sterner things :</p>
   <p>“ I was afraid you would not easily have loosened your affections from the Belles Lettres . A Delicate Taste and warm imagination like yours must find it hard to give up such refined &amp; exquisite enjoyments for the coarse and dry study of the Law . It is like leaving a pleasant flourishing field for a barren desert ; perhaps I should not say barren either because the Law does bear fruit but it is sour fruit that must be gathered and pressed and distilled before it can bring pleasure or profit .... I myself use to have too great a hankering after those amusing studies . Poetry wit and Criticism Romances Plays &amp; c captivated me much : but I begin to discover that they deserve but a moderate portion of a mortal 's Time and that something more substantial more durable more profitable befits our riper age . It would be exceeding improper for a labouring man to have nothing but flowers in his Garden or to determine to eat nothing but sweet-meats and confections . Equally absurd would it be for a Scholar and man of Business to make up his whole Library with Books of Fancy and feed his mind with nothing but such Luscious performances . "[ 15 ]</p>
   <p>The first half of Freneau 's life , as we have seen , was one of disillusion . It took twenty-five years to kill the spark in his breast , but the process though slow was sure . After the fierce period of the National Gazette he thought of himself only as a worker in the tide of practical affairs , a champion of the rights of man , a protestor against tyranny and wrong , and his muse had become a mere drudge , aiding by satire and song what he now conceived to be his life work . He had taken a deliberate though sorrowful leave of his early muse in 1787 , one year after the appearance of his first volume of poems :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ On these bleak climes by fortune thrown</l>
     <l n="2">Where rigid Reason reigns alone ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where flowery Fancy holds no sway</l>
     <l n="4">Nor golden forms around her play ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nor Nature takes her magic hue ,</l>
     <l n="6">Alas what has the muse to do !</l>
     <l n="7">An age employed in painting steel</l>
     <l n="8">Can no poetic raptures feel ;</l>
     <l n="9">No fabled Love 's enchanting power</l>
     <l n="10">No tale of Flora 's shady bower .</l>
     <l n="11">Nor wood-land haunt , or murmuring grove</l>
     <l n="12">Can its prosaic bosom move .</l>
     <l n="13">The muse of love in no request ,</l>
     <l n="14">I 'll try my fortune with the rest ;</l>
     <l n="15">Which of the nine shall I engage</l>
     <l n="16">To suit the humor of the age ?</l>
     <l n="17">On one , alas , my choice must fall ,</l>
     <l n="18">The least engaging of them all !</l>
     <l n="19">Her visage stern , severe her style ,</l>
     <l n="20">A clouded brow , a cruel smile ,</l>
     <l n="21">A mind on murdered victims placed ,</l>
     <l n="22">She , only she , can please the taste . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>One cannot read long the columns of the Jersey Chronicle without realizing forcibly the change that had come over Freneau . The poet who emerged from the crucible of the National Gazette was not at all like the poet of “ The House of Night ” period . He could look upon this product of his early imagination much as Madison would have done , and he could in cold blood cut it down to a mere fragment which would voice his new French Deistic ideas , that he might have room for his Republican songs . The poem “ To the Americans of the United States , ” written in 1797 , gives us a true picture of this later Freneau . He would be no courtly singer “ beneath some great man 's ceiling placed , ” no solitary dreamer . He would be a man of action travelling over lands and seas , a poet who caught his subjects from the varying scene of human things .</p>

     <l n="7">With the fifty-second number of the Chronicle , published April 30 ,</l>
     <l n="8">1796 , the paper came to an end . Freneau 's final editorial stated that :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ In number one of the Jersey Chronicle the editor announced his intention of extending the publication beyond the first year , provided the attempt should in the meantime be suitably encouraged and found practicable . But the necessary number of subscribers having not yet appeared , scarcely to defray the expenses of the undertaking , notwithstanding the very low rate at which it has been offered , the editor with some regret declines a further prosecution of his plan at this time . He embraces the present opportunity to return his sincere thanks to such persons in this and the neighboring counties as have favored him with their subscriptions ; and have also by their punctuality in complying with the terms originally proposed , thus far enabled him to issue a free , independent , and republican paper . ”</p>
   <p>A letter<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>written by Freneau from New York , to Madison , dated December 1 , 1796 , reveals what was in the poet 's mind during the months following the abandonment of the Chronicle :</p>
   <p>“ Having three or four months since formed a resolution to bid adieu for a few years to some old Trees in Jersey under the shade of which I edited , amongst ditching and grubbing , a small weekly Paper entitled the Jersey Chronicle , I did not know how to employ that interval better than in striking out here with some printer , if such could be found , already engaged in supporting the good old Republican cause . After experiencing one or two disappointments in accomplishing this object , I am now through the kind aid of some friends here nearly completing the project of a copartnership with Thomas Greenleaf in his two Papers , The Argus , a daily publication , and the New York Journal , twice a week ; both on a pretty respectable footing , and noted for a steady attachment to Republican principles , though open to all decent speculations from any party if they choose to transmit them . In short , I would wish to revive something in the spirit of the National Gazette , if time and circumstances allow , and with proper assistance hope to succeed — Thus ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A Raven once an acorn took</l>
     <l n="2">From Bashan 's strongest stoutest tree ;</l>
     <l n="3">He hid it near a murmuring brook ,</l>
     <l n="4">And liv 'd another oak to see .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As I consider the bargain the same as concluded , my next object is to make all the friends here that I decently can among men of eminence and ability . This I have in some small degree attempted and gained , but for want of certain insinuating qualities , natural enough I suppose to some men , I feel myself sadly at a loss to get acquainted with some characters here to whom I could wish to be known upon motives of public as well as private utility .</p>
   <p>“ Among these is the chancellor of this State , Robert R. Livingston , with whom , if I recollect right , you are upon terms of intimacy . If I am not mistaken in this point , and you can with propriety accede to my request , you would confer a favor upon me by mentioning me to him in your next Letter , in such manner as you may think best , so that this new connexion may attract some share of his attention , and thereby the countenance of the Livingston family in general , which would operate greatly , through this State at least , in advancing our Subscription and printing Interest in general . ”</p>
   <p>The partnership with Greenleaf , mentioned to Madison , for some reason was never consummated . On March 13 , 1797 , however , Freneau issued in New York the first number of a new journal , The Time Piece and Literary Companion , to be devoted to “ literary amusement and an abridgement of the most interesting intelligence foreign and domestic . ” He “ associated himself , ” as he expressed it , “ as a partner in the typographical line of business with Mr. Alexander Menut of that profession , sometime since from Canada , ” though , during the first year at least , Freneau had entire control of the editing of the paper . His address to the public is of considerable interest :</p>
   <p>“ Several months having elapsed since the publication of a periodical paper in this city was first contemplated by the subscriber , he now informs his friends and the public in general that he has at length so far matured his plan as to attempt a paper of this kind to be published three times a week and transmitted to city subscribers early on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday mornings .</p>
   <p>“ The Time Piece and Literary Companion will on all occasions be open to political , moral , or other interesting discussion from any quarter whatever provided such communications are written with candor , decency , and liberality , their object such as to promote the general good of our great Confederate Commonwealth , or the common interest of man , and conceived in that disinterested spirit which while it carefully avoids as far as possible irritating the feelings of individuals , holds itself obligated under any circumstances whatever to consider truth , the moral and political happiness of our species , social harmony , and good order , the basis of all its exertions , the end of all its aims , views and endeavors . ”</p>
   <p>The paper is a tastily arranged and neatly printed sheet , and its contents show constantly its editor 's rare ability to cater to the public needs . Refinement and a fastidious taste are evidenced everywhere in its columns . Duyckinck comments on “ the skill of the selection and the general elegance of the material , ” which were certainly unusual in those early days of American journalism . The paper had a large number of feminine contributors , who gave freely of their sentimental lyrics and sprightly letters . The poet himself contributed many poems , the most of them , as usual , concerned with contemporary affairs . He republished his translation from the Abbe Robin made in 1783 since , as he declared , only a small edition was then printed , and the work was in the hands of a very few . He republished also his “ Tomo Cheeki ” letters , introducing them thus :</p>
   <p>“ A number of eccentric writings under the subsequent title and to the amount of a considerable volume are in the hands of the editor of the Time Piece said to be translated from one of the Indian languages of this country . They were transmitted to him more than two years ago and a few numbers published in a gazette edited by him in a neighboring State , but discontinued with that paper . If the contributions of a rude aboriginal of America shall appear to afford any gratification to the generality of our readers the whole will be occasionally offered to the public through the medium of the Time Piece . ”</p>
   <p>His pen was constantly active . He wrote vigorous editorials on all passing political measures , and on September 1 , 1897 , proposed to edit Ledyard 's Journals :</p>
   <p>“ The subscriber having procured from the hands of his relatives the original MSS . of Mr. Ledyard now offers to the public of the United States an opportunity of gratifying their curiosity and at the same time paying a token of respect to the memory of Ledyard . Ledyard 's travels will be compiled by P. Freneau from the original MSS . of the author , consisting of letters , journals , notes , etc ., etc ., and such documents as have appeared in print , both in America and Europe , particularly a work published by the British African Society , in whose service , with a view of exploring the interior of Africa , his last expedition was undertaken and terminated in his death at Cairo , in Egypt .</p>
   <p>“ One vol . at least 250 pages .</p>
   <p>“ A life of the author collected from authentic materials will be prefixed to the work , with some other preliminary matter . ”</p>
   <p>Freneau evidently made some progress with the work , for on August 30 , 1798 , the following advertisement appeared in the Time Piece , as well as in the Charleston City Gazette :</p>
   <p>“ The interesting travels of John Ledyard , with a summary of his life , are now in the hands of the printer .</p>
   <p>“ It shall be printed on fine paper with new type ornamented with a full length portrait of the author in the attitude of taking leave on his departure for Africa . Page octavo , handsomely bound and lettered . Calculated to contain between 400 and 500 pages . $ 2 per volume . ”</p>
   <p>The volume , whether from a failure to secure subscribers or other reasons , was never published .</p>
   <p>The partnership of Freneau and Menut was dissolved September 13 , 1797 , and shortly after , the imprint of the paper was changed to read “ Published by P. Freneau and M. L. Davis , No . 26 Moore Street , near Whitehall . ” On January 3 , 1798 , Freneau made a visit to Charleston , taking passage in the sloop Katy , and arriving after a rough voyage of thirty-one days . During the following month he was the guest of his brother , Peter , and in the words of his daughter , of “ his many friends there , among whom were Charles Pinckney , Governor of South Carolina , Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , General Bull , Edge , and many others where he was as much at home as at his brother 's . ” He embarked from Charleston March 7th and arrived in New York after a week 's voyage .</p>
   <p>The affairs of the Time Piece were in a critical condition . A part of the subscribers lived at a distance from New York and the expenses were large . Freneau was unwilling to run further risks , and a few days after his return from the South , he withdrew from the firm , having been editor of the paper just one year . He thereupon retired with his family to the little estate at Mount Pleasant , where he made his home for the rest of his life .</p>
   <p>VI .</p>
   <p>The quiet period after the anxiety and stress of editorship in a great city was for a time grateful to the poet . He managed the farm in a desultory way , but his main occupation was composing verses under his favorite locust tree which had been planted by his father and which had increased in size and numbers until in the words of his daughter , “ it was a complete grove of locust trees surrounding a house grown old with its time worn owner , his venerable mother and maiden sister beloved and respected for her many virtues . Her decease , which took place a few years previous to his own , he says in an obituary , he can say no more nor less than that ‘ she was as good and innocent as an angel . ’ ” This sister , Mary Freneau , a beautiful woman , had been wooed at one time by Madison , but for some reason she had refused him .</p>
   <p>Freneau 's family consisted of four daughters : Eleanor , born in 1791 ; Agnes W ., born June 22 , 1794 ; Catherine L ., born February 25 , 1798 ; and Margaret Alaire , born June 10 , 1801 . Eleanor married a Mr. Hammill , and the four daughters of this union died unmarried ; Agnes married Dr. Edward Leadbeater , and the eldest son of this union , at the earnest request of the poet , was christened Philip Leadbeater Freneau , his grandfather putting into his infant hands the ancestral Bible , which was the family treasure . The descendants of Agnes Freneau and Dr. Leadbeater are very numerous . The two younger daughters of the poet never married .</p>
   <p>The active pen of Freneau , so long practiced in discussing the affairs of the day , could not rest idle during his period of retirement . He began a series of letters to the Philadelphia Aurora and other papers , and on December 30 , 1799 , issued them in a volume entitled “ Letters on Various Interesting and Important Subjects , many of which have appeared in the Aurora . ” It bore his old pen name , Robert Slender , with the added title , O. S. M ., interpreted later to mean “ One of the Swinish Multitude . ” The book has surprising merit . The letters are written in a breezy , colloquial style , and the simple-minded old cobbler is well characterized . Freneau has actually succeeded in making him a living creature , and his opinions and “ whim whams ” are full of hard sense and practical wisdom . The book is by all means the best prose that Freneau ever wrote . So easy is the style and so natural is the characterization that I cannot forbear quoting at some length from a chapter chosen almost at random :</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>LETTER XXII</head>
    <head>MR. EDITOR ,</head>
    <head>Having heard that there was a tavern at about the distance of a mile or so from my favourite country spot , where now and then a few neighbours meet to spit , smoke segars , drink apple whiskey , cider or cider-royal , and read the news — a few evenings ago , I put on my best coat , combed out my wig , put my spectacles in my pocket , and a quarter dollar — This I thought was right ; for although Mrs . Slender told me eleven-pence was enough , says I , I 'll e'en take the quarter dollar , for a man always feels himself of more consequence when he has got good money in his pocket — so out I walks with a good stout stick in my hand , which I always make a point to carry with me , lest the dogs should make rather freer with my legs than I could wish . But I had not gone more than half the way , when , by making a false step , I splash 'd my stocking from knee to the ancle . Odds my heart , said I , see what a hand I have made of my stocking ; I 'll be bail , added I , I 'll hear of this in both sides of my head — but it can n't now be helped — this , and a thousand worse accidents , which daily happen , are all occasioned by public neglect , and the misapplication of the public 's money — Had I , said I , ( talking to myself all the while ) the disposal of but half the income of the United States , I could at least so order matters , that a man might walk to his next neighbour 's without splashing his stockings or being in danger of breaking his legs in ruts , holes , gutts , and gullies . I do not know , says I to myself , as I moralized on my splash 'd stocking , but money might with more profit be laid out in repairing the roads , than in marine establishments , supporting a standing army , useless embassies , exorbitant salaries , given to many flashy fellows that are no honour to us , or to themselves , and chartering whole ships to carry a single man to another nation — Odds my life , continued I , what a number of difficulties a man labours under , who has never read further than Lilly 's grammar , and has but a poor brain — had I been favoured with a good education , I could no doubt readily see the great usefulness of all these measures of government , that now appear to me so unaccountable — I could then , said I , still talking to myself , see the reason why the old patriots , whose blood flowed so freely in purchasing our independence , are cast aside , like a broken pitcher , ( as the scripture says ) and why the old tories and active refugees are advanced to places of power , honour and trust — I could then be able to explain why Robbins , an American citizen , for killing an Englishman who held him a slave , and so gaining his liberty , was delivered to the English to be hanged — and Sterret , who killed a veteran sailor , who had formerly fought and bled in the cause of his country , and then was bravely doing his duty , yet , remains unpunished .... As I said this , by accident I looked up , and perceived to my surprise , that if I had gone but one step further , I would have actually knocked my nose against the sign-post — I declare , said I , here I am , this is a tavern indeed . I then felt in my pocket , if I had my quarter dollar , which to my joy I found — I then unbuttoned my coat , to shew my silk waistcoat , pulled my watch chain a good piece longer out of my pocket , fixed my hat a little better on my head — and then advanced boldly into the tavern — But I see I am got to the end of my page , and therefore must defer the remainder of my adventure to another opportunity . ”</head>
     <l n="1">In the advertisement of the book , the author made the half promise of</l>
     <l n="2">more letters in the same vein :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Should these letters meet with a favourable reception in their present form , a second volume will shortly be published , containing besides those that have since appeared separately a variety of original ones upon such interesting subjects as may hereafter claim the public attention . ”</p>
   <p>The volume was never published . The little family at Mount Pleasant could not subsist alone on letters and poems , however brilliant . The outlook was not a bright one , as the following letter<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>to his brother Peter , in Charleston , dated March 1 , 1801 , would indicate :</p>
   <p>“ Having been here [ New York ] a day or two and finding the brig Echo , Capt . Webb , to sail for Charleston , I take the opportunity of dropping you a line by him .</p>
   <p>“ I left all well at home last Thursday , and the place , etc ., as well as could be expected after my poor mother 's absence . I have been and shall be for some time busy in repairing old fences and making new ones , and some other small improvements , as far as I personally can with the money you let me have . Helen goes to school here , the other two girls are at home , but Agnes is to come here next month for the same purpose for awhile . There are more cares and vexations coming on , but still they must be got through with at some rate . Probably I shall have to embark on some new expedition or plan before long wherever or to whatever the devil , etc ., shall see fit to drive me . But I shall attempt nothing if I can before I see you here , in April or May , as you promised .</p>
   <p>“ I return this morning to Jersey . Mr. Hunn , Peggy , Mamma and Polly all desire their love to you . My love and respects to Mrs. Freneau and Miss Dora with her mother and family . Remembrances , love , etc ., to Mr. Davis , and may I expect to have a line from you by Capt . Peter . ”</p>
   <p>Freneau was at best a half-hearted farmer . A little anecdote told by the family is eloquent . One day the poet and his wife , who had walked together into the field to inspect the work , found a slave asleep in the young corn . Mrs. Freneau seizing his hoe declared that she would show him how to work . At the very first attempt , however , she cut down a hill of corn , whereupon the slave remarked gleefully : “ Ho , ho , Missie Freneau , if that 's the way you hoe , the corn 'll never grow . ” She threw down the hoe in disgust , declaring that “ No wonder the farm does n't pay when even the slaves talk in rhymes . ”</p>
   <p>The affairs of the poet were soon such as to give real concern to his friends . In a letter dated September 13 , 1801 , a part of which we have already quoted , Aedanus Burke wrote Madison :</p>
   <p>“ I am sorry to have it to say that Freneau , with his wife and two children , is still in embarrassed circumstances . He is a virtuous , honest man , and an undeviating Republican ; yet utterly incapable of soliciting anything for himself . The best apology I can offer for mentioning it , is that I know you have great regard for him . You were at College together , as I heard you often say . ”</p>
   <p>However this letter may have been received , Freneau obtained no appointment either from Madison or Jefferson , though there is a persistent tradition among his descendants that he was offered a good position under President Jefferson but refused it on the ground that the latter had deserted him in the National Gazette affair . On October 23 , 1803 , his old-time friend , Francis Bailey , addressed Madison :</p>
   <p>“ My dear sir : The death of Col. Bauman of New York has left the Post Office without a Master . I know of no man in the United States who would fill the office with more ability , or greater integrity , than Philip Freneau . ”</p>
   <p>As far as we know , there was no response , though the family declare that Madison sent for him and that the poet proudly said , “ James Madison knows where I live , let him come to see me . ”</p>
   <p>The “ expedition ” to mend his fortunes , which he had mentioned to his brother as a disagreeable possibility , became at length inevitable . On Saturday , November 27th , he embarked at New York as Master of the schooner John , bound for Fredericksburg , Virginia , with a cargo of salt . A minute log book of this voyage is still to be seen .<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>After an exceedingly hard experience he returned to New York , January 12 , 1803 , and the last entry in the log reads “ Finished discharging the wheat — 1264 bushels at 17 cents a bushel freight — 214 dollars and 88 cents . ”</p>
   <p>This was the opening voyage of his last period at sea . His brother Peter had fitted out at Charleston a new brig for the Madeira trade , and until 1807 Freneau was busy plying between Charleston and the Azores . In one of his books of navigation is inscribed the following :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Sailed from Charleston for Maderia with brig Washington , May 12 ,</l>
     <l n="2">1803 . Got there June 23 . Arrived back at Charleston Aug. 16 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Sailed in ditto from Charleston Jan. 25 , 1804 . Arrived in Maderia March 7th following . A hurricane of wind the whole way . April 12 , sailed from Funchal Road for Teneriff . Arrived at Santa Cruz the 15th ; at Arasava , 22nd . Sailed May 11th . Arrived in Charleston , June 10 . ”</p>
   <p>On June 30 , 1806 , he was in Savannah , Georgia , as Master of the sloop Industry . He made his last voyage to the Azores in the Washington in 1807 . During this last period of sea life we find evidences everywhere that this old enthusiasm for nautical adventure had greatly waned . He was a sailor now from sheer necessity ; he was approaching old age and he longed for the quiet of his home and his family . In one of his books of navigation of this period is penned a verse made in mid Atlantic :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ In dreams condemned to roam</l>
     <l n="2">He left his native home</l>
     <l n="3">O'er land and ocean vast and wide</l>
     <l n="4">With oar and sail , with wind and tide ,</l>
     <l n="5">Proceeding an imaginary way . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="6">In 1809 , Freneau now in retirement at Mount Pleasant , began a new</l>
     <l n="7">edition of his poems . On April 8 , he wrote Madison :[ 19 ]</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ SIR ,— I do myself the pleasure to enclose to you a copy of Proposals for the publication of a couple of Volumes of Poems shortly to be put to the Press in this city . Perhaps some of your particular friends in Virginia may be induced from a view of the Proposals in your hands to subscribe their names . If so , please to have them forwarded to this place by Post , addressed to the Publisher at No . 10 North Alley , Philadelphia . “ Accept my congratulations on your late Election to the Presidency of the United States , and my hopes that your weight of State Affairs may receive every alleviation in the gratitude and esteem of the Public whom you serve in your truly honourable and exalted Station . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Madison 's reply has been lost , but on May 12th , Freneau answered from</l>

   <p>“ SIR ,— After a month 's ramble through the States of New Jersey and New York , I returned to this place on Saturday last , and found your friendly Letter on Mr. Bailey 's table , with the contents . There was no occasion of enclosing any Money , as your name was all I wanted to have placed at the head of the Subscription list .— I hope you will credit me when I say that the republication of these Poems , such as they are , was not a business of my own seeking or forwarding . I found last Winter an Edition would soon be going on at all events , and in contradiction to my wishes , as I had left these old scribblings , to float quietly down the stream of oblivion to their destined element the ocean of forgetfulness . However , I have concluded to remain here this Summer , and have them published in a respectable manner , and free as possible from the blemishes imputable to the two former Editions , over which I had no controul , having given my manuscripts away , and left them to the mercy of chance .— I am endeavouring to make the whole work as worthy of the public eye as circumstances will allow . 1500 copies are to be printed , only ; but I have a certainty , from the present popular frenzy , that three times that number might soon be disposed of .— I will attend to what you direct on the subject , and will forward the ten you mention by the middle of July or sooner .— I will consider of what you say relative to the insertion of a piece or two in prose , but suspect that anything I have written in that way is so inferior to the Poetry , that the contrast will be injurious to the credit of the Publication .— I feel much in the humour of remaining here about two years , to amuse myself , as well as the Public , with such matter as that of the fat man you refer to , and if the public are in the same humour they shall be gratified .— But I am intruding on your time and will add no more at present .— I had almost said —</p>

   </lg>
   <p>“ My best wishes , Sir , will ever await you , and in particular that your Presidential Career may be equally honourable though less stormy than that of your predecessor . ”</p>
   <p>It is evident that Freneau wrote also to Jefferson , for on May 22 , 1809 , the latter wrote from Monticello .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span></p>
   <p>“ SIR ,— I subscribe with pleasure to the publication of your volumes of poems . I anticipate the same pleasure from them which the perusal of those heretofore published has given me . I have not been able to circulate the paper because I have not been from home above once or twice since my return , and because in a country situation like mine , little can be done in that way . The inhabitants of the country are mostly industrious farmers employed in active life and reading little . They rarely buy a book of whose merit they can judge by having it in their hand , and are less disposed to engage for those yet unknown to them . I am becoming like them myself in a preference of the healthy and cheerful employment without doors , to the being immured within four brick walls . But under the shade of a tree one of your volumes will be a pleasant pocket companion .</p>
   <p>“ Wishing you all possible success and happiness , I salute you with constant esteem and respect . ”</p>
   <p>The reply to Freneau 's second letter to Jefferson has also been lost , but Freneau 's letter dated Philadelphia , May 27th , has escaped destruction :[ 23 ]</p>
   <p>“ SIR ,— Yesterday your Letter , dated May 22d came to hand .— Perhaps you a little misunderstood me , when I wrote to you from this place in April last , inclosing the Proposal Paper , respecting the Poems .— I only wished your name to be placed at the head of the list , and did not wish you to be at the pains of collecting Subscriptions , further than as any of your neighbours might choose to put down their names — Indeed , the whole Subscription plan was Set a going without my knowledge or approbation , last Winter . But as I found the matter had gone too far to be recalled , I thought it best to submit , in the present Edition , to the course and order of things as they are and must be .— Sir , if there be anything like happiness in this our State of existence , it will be such to me , when these two little Volumes reach you in August ensuing , if the sentiments in them under the poetical Veil , amuse you but for a single hour .— This is the first Edition that I have in reality attended to , the other two having been published , in a strange way , while I was wandering over gloomy Seas , until embargoed by the necessity of the times , and now again , I fear , I am reverting to the folly of scribbling Verses .</p>
   <p>“ That your shades of Monticello may afford you complete happiness is the wish and hope of all the worthy part of Mankind , and my own in particular . In such the philosophers of antiquity preferred to pass life , or if that was not allowed , their declining days .</p>
   <p>“ Will you be so good as to read the inclosed Verses ? They were published early in March last in the Trenton True American Newspaper , and in the Public Advertiser , of New York . ”</p>
   <p>On August 7 , 1809 , Freneau wrote finally to Madison :[ 24 ]</p>
   <p>“ SIR ,— The two Volumes of Poems that in April last I engaged to have published , are finished , and will be ready for delivery in two or three days . The ten Setts you subscribed for I am rather at a loss how to have safely transmitted to you at your residence in Virginia , where I find by the Newspapers , you mean to Continue until the end of September . Will you on receipt of this , send me a line or two , informing me whether you would prefer having the Books put into the hands of some Confidential person here , to be sent or ; that they be sent to the Post Office at Washington ; or that they be forwarded directly to yourself in Orange County . The precise direction is not in my power . ”</p>
   <p>The 1809 collection is the most elaborate of all the earlier editions of Freneau 's works . His statement that it was the only one which received his personal supervision is certainly wrong , for he had carefully supervised the 1795 edition . On the title page he announced that the poems were “ now republished from the original manuscripts , ” and that he had added several “ translations from the ancients and other pieces not heretofore in print , ” but the new poems that had not previously appeared in the Time Piece were very few . On the title page also he placed the stanza :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Justly to record the deeds of fame ,</l>
     <l n="2">A muse from heaven should touch the soul with flame ;</l>
     <l n="3">Some powerful spirit in superior lays</l>
     <l n="4">Should tell the conflicts of the stormy days . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">The poet 's advertisement is as follows :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The Poems , included in these two volumes , were originally written between the years 1768 and 1793 ; and were partly published in the transient prints of the times , and afterwards collected into two editions of 1786 and 1795 . The present is a revision of the whole , and now published agreeable to the terms of the subscription issued in this city , in April last . Such , perhaps , as are not attracted by mere novelty or amusement , will attend more particularly to the Poems originating from the temporary events of the American war . These Poems were intended , in part to expose to vice and treason , their own hideous deformity ; to depict virtue , honour and patriotism in their native beauty . Such ( says a most distinguished foreign author ) was the intention of poetry from the beginning , and here her purpose should end . Whether the following verses have any real claim to the attention of the citizens of the American United States , who may honour them with a reading , is left for the Public to decide .</p>
   <p>“ To his Countrymen , the real Patriotic Americans , the Revolutionary Republicans , and the rising generation who are attached to their sentiments and principles , the writer hopes this collection will not prove unacceptable . A more complete edition might have been published , so as to include a great number of miscellaneous Poems and animadversions on public events down to the present year , 1809 ; but it has been judged most proper , to restrict what is now printed to the date of 1793 ; with the exception of only a very few pieces of later composition which have been retained , and inserted in the body of the work , but not so as to materially interrupt the general tenor of the Poems that arose from the incidents of the American revolutionary contest .</p>
   <p>“ The Author will only add , that to this Edition are prefixed two copper-plate engravings : the one representing ST. TAMMANY , observing a hostile fleet approaching his shores ; the other a nocturnal view of Captain Jones 's engagement with the Seraphis .— These , it is hoped will be considered not inelegant embellishments of the edition now presented to the public .</p>
   <p>“ Philadelphia , August 2d , 1809 . ”</p>
   <p>The work is divided into four parts :</p>
   <p>“ Book I . Containing translations from the ancients ; and other pieces on various subjects , written in America .</p>
   <p>“ Book II . Containing original pieces , with some relative to the more early events of the American Revolutionary War .</p>
   <p>“ Book III . Containing original poems , written and published at different periods , during the Revolutionary War .</p>
   <p>“ Book IV . Consisting of Miscellaneous pieces , on the events of the times , interspersed with others on moral , satirical , and political subjects . ”</p>
   <p>The author made almost no attempt to arrange the material chronologically as to the dates of composition . He resurrected none of the material dropped from the 1795 collection , but cut from the edition some fifty-five other poems , among them nearly all of the material relating to the French Revolution , the greater number of the New Year Odes , and such fine pieces as “ Neversink , ” “ The Country Printer , ” “ Slender 's Journey , ” and “ The Wintry Prospect . ”</p>
   <p>The text was taken largely from the 1795 version , and a few minor amendments and changes made , but in no case were they so frequent or so careful as those made for the second edition . The poet 's editorial work consisted mainly in elaborated titles with Latin quotations , in foot-notes , and in division of the material into books .</p>
   <p>The next few years of Freneau 's life were spent quietly at Mount Pleasant . He passed his time , as his daughter describes , “ in writing poetry , and in answering and receiving letters . ” Her picture of the man at this period is full of interest . “ Although no farmer , he loved to see the work going on . He was very fond of feeding poultry and all the dumb animals , and when the season came for slaughtering the porkers , he generally managed it so as to have some business in New York , and he was usually absent when poultry was wanted for dinner . Mrs. Freneau had to give orders to the blacks to do it privately . He confessed it a weakness and tried to conceal it . ”</p>
   <p>His interest in politics was still keen . He watched carefully all the premonitory signs of the approaching storm of 1812 , and when war was found to be inevitable , his harp was in full tune to satirize the foe , which he had never ceased to hate , and to celebrate the heroes and the victories of his country .</p>
   <p>On January 12 , 1815 , we find him again in correspondence with his old friend Madison :[ 25 ]</p>
   <p>“ SIR ,— Since my last return from the Canary Islands in 1807 to Charleston and from thence to New York ; with my Brigantine Washington , quitting the bustle and distraction of active life , my walks have been confined , with now and then a short excursion , to the neighbourhood of the Never Sink hills , and under some old hereditary trees , and on some fields , which I well recollect for sixty years . During the last Seven Years my pen could not be entirely idle , and for amusement only now and then I had recourse to my old habit of scribbling verses . A Bookseller in New York , Mr. Longworth , by some means discovered this , and has prevailed on me to put my papers into his hands for publication . With some reluctance I consented to gratify his wish , altho ’ I think after the age of fifty , or thereabouts , the vanity of authorship ought to cease , at least it has been the case with myself . Mr. Longworth informs me the work will be published early in February in two duodecimo volumes . I have directed him , when done , to forward a copy to yourself , of which I beg your acceptance . I do not know that the Verses are of any superior or very unusual merit ; but he tells me the Town will have them : and of course , have them they will , and must , it seems . The Work cannot be very tedious , for in two small Volumes there will be upwards of one hundred and thirty Poems on different subjects , moral , political , or merely amusing , and not a few upon the events of the times since May 1812 . However , you know a short production may sometimes be tedious , and a long one very lively and captivating . None of my effusions in these Volumes much exceed two hundred lines , and several do not reach more than the fourth part of that number of lines .</p>
   <p>“ When I left Philadelphia , about the middle of September 1809 , the ten copies of the Revolutionary Poems , which you subscribed for , were put into a box well secured , and forwarded according to your direction , under the care of General Steele , then Collector of the Port of Philadelphia : I have not since heard whether they reached you or not .</p>
   <p>“ That Edition was published by Subscription merely for the benefit of , and to assist Mrs. Bailey , an unfortunate but deserving widowed female , niece to General Steele , and this consideration alone induced me to pay some attention to that third Edition .</p>
   <p>“ But , in mentioning these matters I fear I am intruding both on your time and patience , constantly , or always perpetually engaged , as you undoubtedly are , in the duties of your station at a stormy period , a tempestuous Presidency indeed : May you weather all the conflicts of these mighty times , and return safe at the proper period to your Virginian Groves , fields and streams : sure I am , different very different indeed from your long intercourse with political Life and the affairs of a ‘ grumbling Hive . ’ My best wishes attend Yourself , and Mrs. Madison , to whom , tho ’ I never had the pleasure of her acquaintance , I beg you to present my best compliments and regards . ”</p>
   <p>On March 3d following , he writes again to Madison :[ 26 ]</p>
   <p>“ SIR ,— When I mentioned in my few lines to you , dated from my residence in New Jersey on the 22d of January last , the two Volumes of Poems publishing in this city by Mr. Longworth , I did really think to have had a small box of them at Washington by the middle of February at farthest , with a particular direction of a couple of copies to Yourself bound in an elegant manner . Finding , however , that the business went on slowly here , and a little vexed to be under the necessity of leaving my Solitude and the wild Scenes of nature in New Jersey for the ever execrated streets and company of this Capital , I embarked near Sandy Hook in a snow storm , about the last of January , and shortly after arrived here , fortunately unnoticed and almost unknown — At my time of life , 63 !!! abounding however in all the powers of health and vigour , though I consider my poetry and poems as mere trifles , I was seriously out of humour on my arrival here to see my work delayed , as well from the severity of the cold , which has been unremitting for more than a month past , and perhaps to some other causes it would not be prudent here to explain . By my incessant exertions in spurring on the indolence of typography , the work , such as it is , is now finished , in two small Volumes of about 180 pages each .— The moment they are out of the bookbinder 's hands , Mr. Longworth will forward you a Copy , and by the first Vessel to Alexandria , Georgetown , or Washington a Box of them to his correspondents in these places . A Copy or two of the Revolutionary poems will be forwarded to your direction — I am sorry the Copies you had were doomed to the flames , but the author had nearly suffered the same fate in the year 1780 .— Yesterday I received from New Jersey a Copy of your friendly Letter of the 1st February : a Copy , I say , for my wife , or some one of my four Girls , daughters , would not forward me the original , but keep it until my return for fear of accidents .</p>
   <p>“ To-morrow morning I embark again for Monmouth , and among other cares , when I arrive at my magical grove , I shall hasten to exert all the poetical energy I possess , on the grand Subject of the Repulse of the British Army from New Orleans . There is a subject indeed ! far above my power , I fear . If there be anything in inspiration , it will be needful on such a theme . Eight hundred lines in Heroic Measure I mean to devote to this animating subject .— In due time you shall hear more from me on this business , if I am not anticipated by some one more muse beloved than myself .— Hoping that all health and happiness may attend you , and that your libraries in future may escape the ravages and flames of Goths and Barbarians — I remain , etc . ”</p>
   <p>Madison 's reply has been lost . On May 10 , 1815 , Freneau wrote his last letter , as far as we know , to Madison :[ 27 ]</p>
   <p>“ SIR ,— Mrs. Anna Smyth , the Lady of Charles Smyth Esquire , a respectable Citizen of this place , being to set out in a few days on a tour to Virginia , and expecting to be in your neighbourhood , either at Washington , or at Montpelier , does me the favour to take under her particular care , to put , or transmit into your hands , the two little Volumes I mentioned to you in my letter last Winter , and to which I received your friendly and obliging Answer .</p>
   <p>“ Be pleased to accept them as a mark of my attention , respect , and esteem , in regard to your private as well as public character .</p>
   <p>“ I have written to Mr. Carey , in Philadelphia , Book-seller there , to forward on to you , if he has them , the two Volumes of the Revolutionary Poems , published in Philadelphia in the Summer of 1809 , and which you wished to regain , since the loss of your Copies in the conflagration at Washington last year . I flatter myself , the arrangement I have made with him will replace them in your hands .— I will only add , that any attention paid by you to Mrs. Smyth , I will consider as conferred on myself . ”</p>
   <p>The 1815 edition contains no poems previously published in the poet 's earlier collections . The work shows no falling off in vigor from the earlier martial standard set by the poet in his more vigorous years . Some critics have declared that the poet 's best work is in this collection . Certain it is that a few of the lyrics of battle have a spirit and swing that make them notable productions .</p>
   <p>Freneau placed upon the title-page the ringing challenge :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Then England come !— a sense of wrong requires</l>
     <l n="2">To meet with thirteen stars your thousand fires :</l>
     <l n="3">Through these stern times the conflict to maintain ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or drown them , with your commerce , in the main . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">He introduced the work as follows :</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The poetical pieces contained in these volumes were composed at different periods , and on a variety of occasions , between the years 1797 and 1815 , and are now presented to the public , printed from the author 's original and corrected manuscripts , and , it is hoped , in such a style of typography , as will not be unacceptable to the reader .— Several of the performances , comprised in this collection , and chiefly those on political subjects , and other events of the times , have heretofore appeared in several periodical publications of this and other STATES of the union . It is presumed , however , that the poems of this description will not be the less acceptable to the friends of the muses , now they are collected in these volumes ; with the advantage of having at one view what were before scattered in those bulky vehicles of information , whose principal object can be little more than to record the common events and business of the day , and soon descend into comparative oblivion .— Whatever may be the fate of the work , they are respectfully offered to the world , in hopes it may obtain a share of their attention , and particularly , from the friends of poetical composition ; and in a country where it may be expected , the fine arts in general will , with the return of peace , find that share of encouragement , which they seem entitled to demand , in every nation that makes any pretensions to refinement and civilization .— It is only necessary to add , that care has been taken to execute the typographical part as correctly as possible . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The poems were reviewed for the Analectic Magazine by Mr. Gulian C .</l>
     <l n="2">Verplanck , who said in part :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ He depicts land battles and naval fights with much animation and gay coloring ; and being himself a son of old Neptune , he is never at a loss ... when the scene lies at sea . His martial and political ballads are free from bombast and affectation , and often have an arch simplicity in their manner that renders them very poignant and striking . If the ballads and songs of Dibdin have cheered the spirits and incited the valor of the British tars , the strains of Freneau , in like manner , are calculated to impart patriotic impulses to the hearts of his countrymen , and their effect in this way should be taken as the test of their merit , without entering into a very nice examination of the rhyme or the reason . For our own part , we have no inclination to dwell on his defects ; we had much rather —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ With full applause , in honor to his age ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dismiss the veteran poet from the stage ,</l>
     <l n="3">Crown his last exit with distinguished praise ,</l>
     <l n="4">And kindly hide his baldness with the bays . ’ ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The last lines used by Verplanck are from “ American Bards , ” a poem published in Philadelphia in 1820 . The reference to Freneau is not without interest :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Let Freneau live , though Flattery 's baleful tongue ,</l>
     <l n="2">Too early tuned his youthful lyre to song ,</l>
     <l n="3">And ripe old age , in ill directed zeal ,</l>
     <l n="4">Has made an enervated last appeal ;</l>
     <l n="5">His song could fire the sailor on the wave ,</l>
     <l n="6">Raise up the coward ,— animate the brave ,</l>
     <l n="7">While wit and satire cast their darts around ,</l>
     <l n="8">And fools and cowards tremble at the sound .</l>
     <l n="9">Although ambition never soared to claim</l>
     <l n="10">The meed of polished verse , or classic fame ,</l>
     <l n="11">And caustic critics honor but condemn ,</l>
     <l n="12">A strain of feeling , but a style too tame .</l>
     <l n="13">Let the old bard whose patient voice has fanned</l>
     <l n="14">The fire of freedom that redeemed our land ,</l>
     <l n="15">Live on the scroll with kindred names that swell</l>
     <l n="16">The page of history , where their honors dwell ;</l>
     <l n="17">With full applause , in honor to his age ,</l>
     <l n="18">Dismiss the veteran poet from the stage ,</l>
     <l n="19">Crown his last exit with distinguished praise ,</l>
     <l n="20">And kindly hide his baldness with the bays . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The last years of Freneau 's life were eventless , passed quietly at Mount Pleasant , and varied only with frequent visits to New York . Shortly after the issue of the 1815 edition of his poems , the ancestral home was completely destroyed by fire , together with most of the poet 's papers , manuscript poems , valuable letters and books — the collection of a lifetime . During his last years he contemplated a complete and final edition of his poetical works . He wrote Dr. Mease of Philadelphia whether there was “ enough of the old spirit of patriotism abroad to insure the safety of such an adventure ; ” and it was the testimony of Alexander Anderson , the once celebrated engraver on wood , that Freneau once consulted with him as to the cost of an illustrated volume of his poems , and departed sadly remarking that his purse was not equal to the venture .</p>
   <p>The best picture of the poet in his old age is from the pen of the genial Dr. John W. Francis of New York , who knew him well during his last years :[ 28 ]</p>
   <p>“ I had , when very young , read the poetry of Freneau , and as we instinctively become attached to the writers who first captivate our imaginations , it was with much zest that I formed a personal acquaintance with the revolutionary bard . He was at that time about seventy-six years old , when he first introduced himself to me in my library . I gave him an earnest welcome . He was somewhat below the ordinary height ; in person thin yet muscular , with a firm step , though a little inclined to stoop ; his countenance wore traces of care , yet lightened with intelligence as he spoke ; he was mild in enunciation , neither rapid nor slow , but clear , distinct , and emphatic . His forehead was rather beyond the medium elevation , his eyes a dark grey , occupying a socket deeper than common ; his hair must have once been beautiful , it was now thinned and of an iron grey . He was free of all ambitious displays ; his habitual expression was pensive . His dress might have passed for that of a farmer . New York , the city of his birth , was his most interesting theme ; his collegiate career with Madison , next . His story of many of his occasional poems was quite romantic . As he had at command types and a printing press , when an incident of moment in the Revolution occurred , he would retire for composition , or find shelter under the shade of some tree , indite his lyrics , repair to the press , set up his types , and issue his productions . There was no difficulty in versification with him . I told him what I had heard Jeffrey , the Scotch Reviewer , say of his writings , that the time would arrive when his poetry , like that of Hudibras , would command a commentator like Gray . On some of the occasions when Freneau honored me with a visit , we had within our circle one of my earliest friends , that rare Knickerbocker , Gulian C. Verplanck . I need not add that the charm of my interview with the bard was heightened by the rich funds of antiquarian lore possessed by the latter .</p>
   <p>“ It is remarkable how tenaciously Freneau preserved the acquisitions of his early classical studies , notwithstanding he had for many years , in the after portion of his life , been occupied in pursuits so entirely alien to books . There is no portrait of the patriot Freneau ; he always firmly declined the painter 's art , and would brook no ‘ counterfeit presentiment . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Freneau 's frequent visits to New York were the chief solace of his last years . Says Dr. Francis :</p>
   <p>“ Freneau was widely known to a large circle of our most prominent and patriotic New Yorkers . His native city , with all his wanderings , was ever uppermost in his mind and in his affections . While in the employment of Jefferson , as a translator in the department of state , upon the organization of Congress , with Washington at its head , he had the gratification of witnessing the progress of improvement , and might have enjoyed increased facilities had he not enlisted with an indiscreet zeal as an advocate of the radical doctrines of the day . Freneau was , nevertheless , esteemed a true patriot ; and his private worth , his courteous manner , and his general bearing won admiration with all parties . His pen was more acrimonious than his heart . He was tolerant , frank in expression , and not deficient in geniality . He was highly cultivated in classical knowledge , abounding in anecdotes of the revolutionary crisis , and extensively acquainted with prominent characters .</p>
   <p>“ It were easy to record a long list of eminent citizens who ever gave him a cordial welcome . He was received with the warmest greetings by the old soldier , Governor George Clinton . He , also , in the intimacy of kindred feeling , found an agreeable pastime with the learned Provoost , the first regularly consecrated Bishop of the American Protestant Episcopate , who himself had shouldered a musket in the Revolution , and hence was sometimes called the fighting bishop . They were allied by classical tastes , a love of natural science , and ardor in the cause of liberty . With Gates he compared the achievements of Monmouth with those at Saratoga . With Col . Fish he reviewed the capture of Yorktown ; with Dr. Mitchell he rehearsed , from his own sad experience , the physical sufferings and various diseases of the incarcerated patriots of the Jersey prison-ship ; and descanted on Italian poetry and the piscatory eclogues of Sannazarius . He , doubtless , furnished Dr. Benjamin Dewitt with data for his funeral discourse on the remains of the 11 , 500 American martyrs . With Pintard he could laud Horace and talk largely of Paul Jones . With Major Fairlie he discussed the tactics and chivalry of Baron Steuben . With Sylvanus Miller he compared notes on the political clubs of 1795-1810 . With Dewitt Clinton and Cadwallader D. Colden he debated the projects of internal improvement and artificial navigation , based on the famous precedent of the Languedoc canal . ”</p>
   <p>The death of Freneau was a sad one . On the evening of the 18th of December , 1832 , he had gone on an errand to Freehold , some two miles distant . When he set out to return , late in the evening , a fierce and blinding storm was in progress . His friends sought to dissuade him , but he insisted on returning . Instead of taking the long way round by the road , he took the usual short way through the fields , and was soon lost in the roaring “ blizzard . ” He circled into a swamp , and doubtless , after hours of wandering , sank down benumbed and hopeless , to be found by his friends a few hours later , still breathing but nearly lifeless . For the whispered tradition that he was intoxicated when he left the town , there is no foundation .</p>
   <p>The next issue of the Monmouth Press contained a notice of his death :</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Freneau was in the village and started , towards evening , to go home , about two miles . In attempting to go across he appears to have got lost and mired in a bog where his lifeless corpse was discovered yesterday morning . Captain Freneau was a stanch Whig in the time of the Revolution , a good soldier , and a warm patriot . The productions of his pen animated his countrymen in the darkest days of ‘ 76 and the effusions of his muse cheered the desponding soldier as he fought the battles of freedom . ”</p>
   <p>His old friend , John Pintard , wrote a biographical notice of the poet in the New York Mirror for January 12 , 1833 , in which he dwelt largely upon his mental endowments and accomplishments :</p>
   <p>“ He was a man of great reading and extensive acquirements ; few were more thoroughly versed in classical literature , and fewer still who knew as much about the early history of our country , the organization of the government , and the use and progress of parties . ”</p>
   <p>The house which Freneau occupied during his last years is still standing . His remains rest in the little cemetery at Mount Pleasant , which recently , in honor of the poet , has been rechristened Freneau .</p>

    <head>VII .</head>
    <head>The personality of Philip Freneau , if we judge from contemporary testimony and the effect which his personal presence invariably exerted , was a singularly winning one . The bluff , hearty old sailor breathed out good-will and honesty with every breath . He was the soul of honor , and , despite his caustic pen , the kindest hearted creature in the world . All that one of his grand-daughters can remember of him is that once he took her upon his knee and chided her for having killed a fly . “ Surely , ” he said , “ it was not made without some wise end , and its little life was as dear to him as is yours to you . ” It reminds one of “ My Uncle Toby . ” There is a cheery optimism in many of his poems . A stanza like this might have been written by Browning :</head>
     <l n="1">“ All nature must decay , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="2">But nature shall her face renew ,</l>
     <l n="3">Her travels in a circle make ,</l>
     <l n="4">Freeze but to thaw , sleep but to wake ,</l>
     <l n="5">Die but to live and live to die . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His temperament was Celtic . He inherited with his French blood a passionate love for beauty , a sensuous , dreamy delight in the merely poetic , in the weird and romantic . He had not the Teutonic stability ; he was easily exalted , easily depressed ; he went often to extremes ; he was sensitive to a degree that made criticism a torture , and he was proud beyond all reason . He had been deeply touched by the principles of the Revolution ; he had suffered personally at the hands of the enemy ; he had followed Paine in his democratic doctrines even to the extremes , and he tried to live consistently with these exalted ideals . His honesty and his ignorance of the world prevented him from seeing how greatly these principles must be modified to become of really practical value .</p>
   <p>His kindly heart made him a fierce foe to all kinds of tyranny and oppression . He saw sights in the West Indies that made him a bitter opponent of human slavery . Again and again in his poems and prose sketches does he condemn the evil . His message is almost as intense as Whittier 's :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ O come the time and haste the day</l>
     <l n="2">When man shall man no longer crush ,</l>
     <l n="3">When reason shall enforce her sway ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor these fair regions raise the blush</l>
     <l n="5">Where still the African complains</l>
     <l n="6">And mourns his yet unbroken chains . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Not only slavery , but every other form of oppression and wrong received his condemnation . He wrote boldly against intemperance in a day when the use of intoxicating liquors was well-nigh universal and wholly uncriticised ; he spoke eloquently on cruelty to animals ; and he was one of the earliest to demand equal rights for man and woman .</p>
   <p>Freneau 's religious inclinations have been sometimes harshly criticised by those of puritanic creed . The school of Dr. Dwight could speak of him only in contempt , yet it is true that the poet was a deeply religious man . His love of freedom and his perfect sincerity affected his creed . He had an intense dislike for hollow formalism . In his “ Jamaica Funeral ” he has pictured a hypocritical priest in colors as vivid almost as Chaucer 's . He detested</p>
   <p>“ The holy man by Bishops holy made . ”</p>
   <p>He loved sincerity , and the creed that came not from dry formalism , but from reason and from an honest heart .</p>
   <p>It has often been overlooked by his critics that Freneau was a widely read and thoroughly cultured man ; that he was a linguist of more than ordinary powers ; and that he knew intimately the chief writings in Latin , Italian , French , and English . He was no ignorant , careless scribbler , tossing into the ephemeral columns of the press hasty rhymes of which he never thought again . He revised and corrected with patient care , and he took a deep interest in the children of his pen , rescuing at one time or another almost every one of them from the oblivion of the newspaper .</p>
   <p>VIII .</p>
   <p>As to the absolute literary value of Freneau 's literary remains , there is room for honest difference of opinion . He is certainly not , if we judge him from what he actually produced , a great poet . But he must in fairness be viewed against the background of his age and his environment . Nature had equipped him as she has equipped few other men . He had the poet 's creative imagination ; he had an exquisite sense of the beautiful ; and he had a realization of his own poetic endowments that kept him during a long life constantly true to the muse . Scarcely a month went by in all his life , from his early boyhood , that was not marked by poetic composition . Few poets , even in later and more auspicious days , have devoted their lives more assiduously to song .</p>
   <p>Freneau was the first to catch what may be called the new poetic impulse in America — the new epic note . Previous to the Revolutionary era , America was destitute even of the germs of an original literature . Before she could produce anything really strong and individual , there was necessary some great primal impulse that should stir mightily the whole people ; that should strike from their hands the old books and the old models ; that should arouse them to a true realization of themselves ; and that should clear the atmosphere for a new and broader view of human life . Such new forces are always needed by society , but they stalk with long strides over the centuries .</p>
   <p>In pre-Revolutionary America such an upheaval was near at hand . It came with appalling suddenness . The colonists had had no gradual preparation for the idea of separation from England . As late as 1775 , Franklin declared before the House of Commons that in all of his journeyings up and down the colonies he had not heard expressed one single wish for complete independence . Even after Concord and Bunker Hill , Freneau , the radical , could write :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Long may Britannia rule our hearts again ,</l>
     <l n="2">Rule as she ruled in George the Second 's reign . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The idea of independence came all in a moment ; but once it had come , it went with leaps and bounds to its extreme . Never in all history has a whole people been lifted by such rapid stages into a region of such vast outlook . We can trace the growth of the new spirit , not decade by decade , but month by month : Justice , Freedom , Independence , and then the radiant vision of perfect Liberty and the Rights of Man , and then like a torrent the sense of boundless possibilities and glorious destiny :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ No pent-up Utica contracts our powers ,</l>
     <l n="2">But the whole boundless continent is ours . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The soul of man stirred by such ideals , and successful in realizing them beyond all dreams , struggled for utterance . It is such upheavals in human society that make poets and bring outbursts of song and periods in the history of literature . But there was no burst of song in America ; instead there followed one of the most pathetic spectacles in all literary history — a people with a vision that transported them into the clouds , yet powerless through environment and early education to transmute that vision into song . The South , thrilled by the new spirit , turned it at once into action , and took the leadership in war and statesmanship . New England lifted up her voice , but she could speak only through the medium of old spiritual conceptions and worn-out poetic forms . A young Connecticut parson , thrilled through and through , pours his enthusiasm into an epic of the wars of Joshua done in the heroics of Pope ; a brilliant Boston lad would sing of “ War and Washington , ” but he must set it to the tune of Dryden ; and a gifted Connecticut satirist , overflowing with the true poetic spirit , is content simply to add new American stanzas to “ Hudibras . ” With all her rhymers and all her inspiration , New England gave forth not a single original note . It was the repeating of the old spectacle of a heavenly anthem sung unto shepherds ,— unto those utterly unable to give it utterance .</p>
   <p>We see them , however , struggling heroically with the burden . From 1774 , when Dwight completed his “ Conquest of Canaan , ” “ the first piece of this kind ever attempted in this country , ” as he observed in his preface , until 1808 , which ends the period with Barlow 's “ Columbiad ” — the “ Polyolbion ” of American poetry — the years are strewn thick with the wrecks of epics . Every poet of the era felt his soul burn with the epic fire . Charles Brockden Brown , when only sixteen , had started no less than three of these Homeric efforts : one on the discovery of America , and one each on the conquests of Mexico and Peru . It was our heroic era , but it yielded almost nothing of value . Mere exaltation availeth little unless it be grounded either upon genius or long-continued culture .</p>
   <p>America , however , was not without her genius . Before Dwight and Barlow and Trumbull had written a line , Freneau at Princeton was planning epics American in scene and spirit . He had dreamed , over his Virgil , of a greater Aeneas who had sailed into the pathless West to discover a new world , and to plant there the seeds of a greater than Rome ; he had translated with beating heart the words of Seneca :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ The time shall come , when numerous years are past ,</l>
     <l n="2">When ocean shall unloose the bands of things ,</l>
     <l n="3">And an extended region rise at last ;</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">“ And Typhis shall disclose the mighty land</l>
     <l n="5">Far , far away , where none have rov 'd before ;</l>
     <l n="6">Nor shall the world 's remotest region be</l>
     <l n="7">Gibraltar 's rock , or Thule 's savage shore . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Fired at the theme , ” he had mapped out the epic of a new world ; but his work of this era , like all schoolboy epics , had resulted only in fragments which were to strew his earlier volumes . How strong and original was this youthful dream one can judge from the ringing lines of “ Columbus to Ferdinand , ” “ Discovery , ” and the “ Pictures of Columbus , ” which are mere epic fragments . There is an originality and a fire in them utterly new in American poetry . There is poetry of a high order in such a climax as that recording the soliloquy of the dying Columbus , beginning :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The winds blow high ; one other world remains ,</l>
     <l n="2">Once more without a guide I find the way . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But Commencement was at hand . Here was a chance , indeed ; here was a theme commensurate with the occasion . The two young dreamers would outline an epic poem ; they would essay “ Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme ":</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Now shall the adventurous Muse attempt a theme</l>
     <l n="2">More new , more noble , and more flush of fame</l>
     <l n="3">Than all that went before . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Never was graduating exercise based on broader foundations . The young graduates bewail at every step their limitations of space . The plan they suggest is the plan of a “ Columbiad . ” They would begin with all the tale of Columbus ; they would rehearse the story of Cortez and Pizarro ; they would discuss at learned length the origin and the characteristics of the Indians ; they would tell the story of the early colonies ; and would trace the course of settlement and review the progress and the promise of agriculture and commerce ; they would peer into the future and mark the time</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">

   <p>It is not a great poem when we measure it by absolute standards , but “ The Rising Glory of America ” is a very great poem if we view it in connection with the conditions and the environment that produced it . Full as it is of Latin influence and Commencement day zeal , it is the first real poem that America ever made — the first poem that was impelled hot from a man 's soul . It is more than this , it is the first real fruit of a new influence in the world of letters — the first literary product of that mighty force that was to set in motion the American and French Revolutions , with all that they mean in human history .</p>
   <p>America should have recognized this new and original voice , and should have encouraged it to sing the new message which it had to proclaim to the world , but she was not yet ready .</p>
   <p>How the young dreamer , who had seen life from his earliest years only through the medium of his books , was gradually disillusioned , we have endeavored to show . His first book , put forth in the enthusiasm of inexperience , with his name on the title-page , was “ damned by all good and judicious judges . ” So was Wordsworth 's ; so have been the earliest ventures of every innovator in the field of song . Gradually the young poet awoke to a realization of his position : America was unprepared for her prophet ; she would not listen . The discovery disheartened him ; his Celtic temperament would not patiently wait for recognition , as did Wordsworth ; he was too proud to force his poetry upon an unwilling public . He would leave the scene , for three years to dwell in the dreamy seclusion of the tropic islands .</p>
   <p>This was his period of pure invention , where he showed the possibilities of his genius . With the “ House of Night ” he became one of the earliest pioneers in that dimly-lighted region which was soon to be exploited by Coleridge and Poe . The poem is the first distinctly romantic note heard in America . Moreover , one may search in vain in the English poetry of the early romantic movement for anything that can equal it in strength of conception , in mastery of weird epithet , and in sustained command over the vaguely terrible . The page that recounts the poet 's departure from the house of night , quaking with fear ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Beneath my feet substantial darkness lay ,</l>
     <l n="2">And screams were heard from the distempered ground , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>his timid look behind him to find the windows of the infernal dome a “ flaming hell-red , ” the fearful shrieks of the dying monster within the walls , the “ hell-red wandering light ” that led him to the graves , the sudden peal of the iron bell above him in the darkness , and then the troop of spectres galloping fiercely on Death 's horses , while “ their busy eyes shot terror to my soul , ” — all this is worthy of Poe . As a product of pure imagination , the poem is most remarkable , especially when we view it in connection with the English literature of its day . In its weird supernaturalism it anticipated Scott , and in its unearthly atmosphere it clearly anticipated Coleridge .</p>
   <p>In the “ Jamaica Funeral ” the poet outlined his early philosophy of life . He was fast breaking from the influence of Gray , his early master . It is a Gallic philosophy that he outlines ; he is becoming infected with Deism ; he is a true bacchanalian . Is there not a ring of the “ Rubaiyat ” in a stanza like this :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Count all the trees that crown Jamaica 's hills ,</l>
     <l n="2">Count all the stars that through the heavens you see ,</l>
     <l n="3">Count every drop that the wide ocean fills ,</l>
     <l n="4">Then count the pleasures Bacchus yields to me ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Freneau 's early dream of a purely poetic career was rudely broken by the sudden clash of war and by the sternly practical nature of the American people . Circumstances decided for him his career . There was needed a poetic voice to arouse the common people to action . There was no demand for an imaginative creator , for a sensuous singer of love and wine ,— America needed a popular voice , one that could be understood by the unlettered , one that with satire and patriotic appeal could arouse and fire the land . Freneau laid aside for a time the harp and the lyre and took up the trumpet and the bagpipes , and of his influence on the stormy period of the Revolution there can be no two opinions . His ballads and satires were scattered far and wide ; they were sold in broadsides in every port and city and camp . Even in the war of 1812 his poems flew like leaves everywhere that men were gathered together . To be the lyrist of a righteous revolution , and above all to be the people 's poet , is in itself no small distinction .</p>
   <p>His poems of the war are in themselves a running history of the struggle , especially of its last years . His heart was in his work ; the prison ship had blotted for a time all memories of the old criticisms of his early work , all his early dreams , everything save “ the insulting foe ” who was making desolate his dear mother land . He lampooned without mercy Clinton , Cornwallis , Carleton , and the royalist printers , Rivington and Gaine . He sang tender lyrics of the patriot dead at Eutaw Springs , who</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Saw their injured Country 's woe ;</l>
     <l n="2">The flaming town , the wasted field ;</l>
     <l n="3">Then rushed to meet the insulting foe ;</l>
     <l n="4">They took the spear ,— but left the shield . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He sang peans of victory over the downfall at Yorktown ; he exalted the fame of Washington ; he called down maledictions on the ship that bore the “ worthless Arnold ” from American shores . These are more than the fleeting voices of a newspaper muse ; they are true poems , and they are American to the core . Scott declared that “ Eutaw Springs [ was ] as fine a thing as there is of the kind in the language . ”</p>
   <p>With a few fiery songs he placed himself at the head of the small group of naval lyrists , a position which even to-day he has not wholly lost . In dash and fire , in ability to catch and reproduce the odors and the atmosphere of the ocean , in enthusiasm and excitement that is contagious and that plunges the reader at once into the heart of the action , and in glowing patriotism that makes the poems national hymns , no American poet has excelled this earliest singer of the American ocean . No true patriot can read without a thrill of pride such songs as “ Captain Jones 's Invitation ” and “ The Death of Captain Biddle , ” a song of the intrepid seaman who from the Randolph poured death into the British ship :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Tremendous flash ! and hark , the ball</l>
     <l n="2">Drives through old Yarmouth , flames and all , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and then in a fatal moment was blown up by his own magazine , and “ Stanzas on the New Frigate Alliance , ” the gallant ship “ who walks the ocean like its queen , ” and “ Barney 's Victory over the General Monk , ” that rollicking song of battle and of triumph , and best of all , perhaps , “ The Sailor 's Invitation , ” which is full of the very salt and vigor of the western seas . “ The Memorable Victory of Paul Jones , ” written when America was ringing with the first news of the battle , is one of the glories of American literature . Longfellow or Whittier never wrote a more stirring ballad . It moves with leaps and bounds ; it is full of the very spirit of battle .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ She felt the fury of her ball ,</l>
     <l n="2">Down , prostrate down , the Britons fall ;</l>
     <l n="3">The decks are strew 'd with slain :</l>
     <l n="4">Jones to the foe his vessel lash 'd ;</l>
     <l n="5">And while the black artillery flash 'd</l>
     <l n="6">Loud thunders shook the main . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is not impertinent to observe that Thomas Campbell was but four years of age when this appeared . It was not Scott or Cooper who added the domain of the ocean to literature ; it was Freneau . His books are full of the roar and the sweep of the open sea , which he knew as the farmer knows his ancestral acres . There is no more true and vigorous picture of an ocean voyage and a naval combat than that contained in Canto I of “ The British Prison Ship . ” The episode of the boatswain 's fiery prayer , just before the conflict , is unique in literature .</p>
   <p>The war over , Freneau would return to his dream ; he would pour forth the poetic message that was in him ; but his countrymen , delighting in his hard blows and biting sarcasm , refused to listen to the merely poetic . They demanded jingles and clever hits . The poet turned fiercely upon them . “ For men I keep a pen , ” he cried , “ for dogs a cane . ” The time for using the cane was past ; he would use it no more . But who would listen to anything that was not rant and bombast ? Fate had thrown him into a “ bard-baiting clime . ” A wave of the old bitterness swept over him :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Expect not in these times of rude renown</l>
     <l n="2">That verse like yours will have the chance to please :</l>
     <l n="3">No taste for plaintive elegy is known ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor lyric ode ,— none care for things like these . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>How he at length deliberately turned from the muse of his choice , and how after a long experience with the world of actual affairs he exchanged his old poetic ideals for those of mere reason and common sense , we have attempted to show .</p>
   <p>Here was a man equipped by nature for a true poet , a man with a message , yet dwarfed and transformed by his environment . America was not ready for her singer . It took half a century more to make way in the wilderness for the new message that had been whispered to Freneau in his young manhood . Had he been a great world-poet , he would have been heard despite all difficulties ; he would have trampled down the barriers about him and have compelled his age to listen , but the task was beyond him . America , to this day , has produced no poet who single-handed and alone could have performed such a labor of Hercules . Sadly Freneau turned to other things .</p>
   <p>He has never been adequately recognized . Had the first edition of his poems , published the same year as the Kilmarnock edition of Burns , been an English book , it long ago would have figured largely in the histories of the romantic and naturalistic movement which made possible the great outburst of the nineteenth century . That Freneau was the most conspicuous pioneer in the dim romantic world that was to be explored by Coleridge and Poe , we have already shown ; that he was a pioneer in the movement that succeeded in throwing off the chain forged by Pope is evident to any one who will examine his early work . “ The Wild Honey Suckle , ” for instance , which was written in 1786 , twelve years before the “ Lyrical Ballads , ” is as spontaneous and as free from Pope as anything written by Wordsworth . It is a nature lyric written with the eye upon the object , without recollection of other poetry , and it draws from the humble flower a lesson for humanity in the true Wordsworthian manner . Before Freneau , American poetry had been full of the eglantine , the yew , the Babylonian willow , the lark — the flora and fauna of the Hebrew and British bards . In our poet we find , for the first time , the actual life of the American forest and field — the wild pink , the elm , the wild honeysuckle , the pumpkin , the blackbird , the squirrel , the partridge , “ the loquacious whip-poor-will , ” and in addition to this the varied life of the American tropic islands . We find for the first time examples of that true poetic spirit that can find inspiration in humble and even vulgar things ; that , furthermore , can draw from lowly nature and her commonplaces deep lessons for human life . Freneau sees the reflection of the stars in the bosom of the river ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ But when the tide had ebbed away</l>
     <l n="2">The scene fantastic with it fled ,</l>
     <l n="3">A bank of mud around me lay</l>
     <l n="4">And sea-weed on the river 's bed , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and from this he draws the obvious moral for human life . Consider what Pope would have said of mud . Indeed , to appreciate Freneau , one must come to him after a careful reading of the classic poets who preceded him . What a shock to this school would have been the vividly realistic poem on “ Logtown . ” Just how much Freneau influenced the school of poets who in England broke away from the trammels of the eighteenth century , we can never know ; yet no one can read long in the American poet and not be convinced that his influence was considerable . His poems were known and read freely in England at the very dawn of the critical period in British poetry , and their echoes can be detected more than once .</p>
   <p>In his use of his native land and his familiar surroundings as a background for art , Freneau discovered the poetical side of the Indian , and thus became the literary father of Brockden Brown , Cooper , and the little school of poets which in the early years of the century fondly believed that the aboriginal American was to be the central figure in the poetry of the new world . To the little real poetry that there is in the Indian , Freneau did full justice , but he went to no such absurd lengths as did Eastburn and Whittier . The “ Indian Death Song , ” if it indeed be his , is full of the wild , stoical heroism of the brave who is dying beneath the torture of his enemies . In “ The Indian Student ” he has covered fully the Indian 's love for the pathless forest , and to the untamable wildness of his nature . “ The Dying Indian ” and “ The Indian Burying-Ground ” sum up what is essentially poetic in Indian legend and all that is pathetic in the fate of the vanishing race . Poetry , if it is to confine itself to the truth , can do little more for the Indian .</p>
   <p>Such was Philip Freneau , a man in every respect worthy to bear the title of “ the father of American poetry . ” He was the first true poet born upon our continent ; he realized in his early youth his vocation ; he gave himself with vigor and enthusiasm to his calling ; he fitted himself by wide reading and classic culture ; he received the full inspiration of a great movement in human society ; he lifted up his voice to sing , but he was smothered and silenced by his contemporaries . He was all alone ; he had about him no circle of “ Pleiades ” to encourage and assist ; he had no traditions , religious or otherwise , that would compel silence . He was out of step with the theology of his generation ; he was out of tune with the music of his day ; he was beating time a half century ahead of the chorus about him . The people have to be educated to revolution , and America had not yet learned to take the initiative in things intellectual and aesthetic . She must follow the literary fashions beyond the sea . Freneau was for breaking violently away from England and for setting up a new standard of culture and literary art on this side the water .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Can we never be thought</l>
     <l n="2">To have learning or grace</l>
     <l n="3">Unless it be brought</l>
     <l n="4">From that damnable place ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>he cried . But he reckoned without his countrymen . Not until Emerson 's day did it dawn upon America that it was possible for her to think for herself and make poetry that did not echo the English bards . Thus did America reject her earliest prophet ; thus did she stop her ears and compel him to lay aside his seven-stringed lyre for the horn and the bagpipes .</p>
   <p>Freneau lived to see his discarded harp in full tune in other hands , first in England and then in his own land . There is something truly pathetic in the figure of the old minstrel , who had realized almost nothing of his early dreams , and yet who had been told by the great Jeffries that the time would surely come when his poems would command a commentator like Gray , who had been extravagantly praised by such masters as Scott and Campbell , who had written to Madison as late as 1815 , “ my publisher tells me the town will have them [ his verses ] and of course have them they will , ” it is pathetic to see this poet , in his hoary old age , for he lived until 1832 , realizing that he had been utterly forgotten , witnessing the triumph of the very songs that had haunted his youth , and seeing those who had not half his native ability crowned by those who had rejected and forgotten him . Such ever is the penalty of being born out of due time .</p>
   <p>The present age has also been unjust to Freneau . It has left his poems in their first editions , which are now extremely rare and costly ; it has scattered his letters and papers to the winds ; it has garbled and distorted his life in every book of reference ; it has left untold the true story of his career ; it has judged him from generalizations that have floated from no one knows where . But time works slowly with her verdicts ; true merit in the end is sure to receive its deserts ; and Freneau may even yet be given the place that is his .</p>

     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="2">In ages past , when smit with warmth sublime ,</l>
      <l n="3">Their bards foretold the dark events of time ,</l>
      <l n="4">And piercing forward through the mystic shade ,</l>
      <l n="5">Kings yet to come , and chiefs unborn survey 'd ,</l>
      <l n="6">Amittai 's son perceiv 'd , among the rest ,</l>
      <l n="7">The mighty flame usurp his labouring breast :—</l>
      <l n="8">For this , in dreams , the voice unerring came</l>
      <l n="9">Of Him , who lives through every age the same :</l>
      <l n="10">“ Arise ! and o'er the intervening waste ,</l>
      <l n="11">“ To Nineveh 's imperial turrets haste ;</l>
      <l n="12">“ That mighty town to ruin I decree ,</l>
      <l n="13">“ Proclaim destruction , and proclaim from me :</l>
      <l n="14">“ Too long it stands , to God and man a foe ,</l>
      <l n="15">“ Without one virtue left to shield the blow ;</l>
      <l n="16">“ Guilt , black as night , their speedy ruin brings ,</l>
      <l n="17">“ And hottest vengeance from the King of Kings . ”</l>
      <l n="18">The prophet heard — but dared to disobey ,</l>
      <l n="19">( Weak as he was ) and fled a different way ;</l>
      <l n="20">In Joppa 's port a trading ship he found</l>
      <l n="21">Far o'er the main to distant Tarshish bound :</l>
      <l n="22">The price of passage to her chief he paid ,</l>
      <l n="23">And there conceal 'd with wandering sailors stay 'd ,</l>
      <l n="24">His purpose fixt , at once perverse and blind ,</l>
      <l n="25">To leave his country , and his God behind .</l>
      <l n="26">But He who spread the ocean 's vast expanse ,</l>
      <l n="27">And views all nature with a single glance ,</l>
      <l n="28">Forth from its prison bade the tempest fly —</l>
      <l n="29">The tempest swell 'd the ocean to the sky ;</l>
      <l n="30">The trembling barque , as the fierce billow knocks ,</l>
      <l n="31">Scarce bears the fury of repeated shocks ;</l>
      <l n="32">Her crew distrest , astonish 'd and afraid ,</l>
      <l n="33">Each to his various god in anguish pray 'd ,</l>
      <l n="34">Nor trust alone to penitence and prayer ,</l>
      <l n="35">They clear the decks , and for the worst prepare ,</l>
      <l n="36">The costly lading to the deep they throw ,</l>
      <l n="37">That lighter o'er the billows she may go ,</l>
      <l n="38">Nor with regret the wealthy cargo spared ,</l>
      <l n="39">For wealth is nothing when with life compared .</l>
      <l n="40">But to the ship 's remotest chambers fled</l>
      <l n="41">There pensive Jonah droop 'd his languid head ,</l>
      <l n="42">And , new to all the dangers of the deep ,</l>
      <l n="43">Had sunk , dejected , in the arms of sleep —</l>
      <l n="44">‘ Twas then the master broke the prophet 's rest ,</l>
      <l n="45">And thus exclaim 'd , and smote his frantic breast —</l>
      <l n="46">“ O sleeper , from thy stupid slumbers rise ,</l>
      <l n="47">“ At such an hour can sleep invade thine eyes ?—</l>
      <l n="48">“ If ever thou to heaven didst send a prayer ,</l>
      <l n="49">“ Now send thy warmest supplications there ,</l>
      <l n="50">“ Perhaps thy God may pity our distress ,</l>
      <l n="51">“ And save us , foundering in this dark abyss . ”</l>
      <l n="52">Thus warn 'd , the seer his vows repentant paid —</l>
      <l n="53">Meantime , the seamen to their fellows said :</l>
      <l n="54">“ No common waves our shatter 'd vessel rend ,</l>
      <l n="55">“ There must be one for whom these storms impend ,</l>
      <l n="56">“ Some wretch we bear , for whom these billows rise ,</l>
      <l n="57">“ Foe to the gods , and hated by the skies ;</l>
      <l n="58">“ Come , since the billows all our arts defy ,</l>
      <l n="59">“ Come , let the lot decide for whom we die . ”</l>
      <l n="60">Instant the lots amidst the vase they threw ,</l>
      <l n="61">And the markt lot dejected Jonah drew !</l>
      <l n="62">Then thus their chief the guilty man address 'd ,</l>
      <l n="63">“ Say , for what crime of thine are we distrest ?</l>
      <l n="64">“ What is thy country , what thy calling , say ,</l>
      <l n="65">“ Whence dost thou come , what potentate obey ?</l>
      <l n="66">“ Unfold it all , nor be the truth deny 'd . ” —</l>
      <l n="67">The master spoke , and Jonah thus reply 'd :</l>
      <l n="68">“ A Hebrew I , from neighbouring regions came ,</l>
      <l n="69">“ A Jewish prophet , of no vulgar fame :</l>
      <l n="70">“ That God I fear who spread this raging sea ,</l>
      <l n="71">“ Who fixt the shores by his supreme decree ,</l>
      <l n="72">“ And reigns throughout immeasurable space ,</l>
      <l n="73">“ His footstool earth , the heaven his dwelling place .</l>
      <l n="74">“ But I , regardless of his high command ,</l>
      <l n="75">“ His mandate slighting , fled my native land ,</l>
      <l n="76">“ Fool that I was , from Joppa 's port to fly ,</l>
      <l n="77">“ Who thought to shun his all-pervading eye !</l>
      <l n="78">“ For this the tempest rends each tatter 'd sail ,</l>
      <l n="79">“ For this your vessel scarce supports the gale ! ”</l>
      <l n="80">The seamen heard , distracted and dismay 'd ;</l>
      <l n="81">When thus again their trembling pilot said :</l>
      <l n="82">“ How couldst thou thus , ungenerous as thou art ,</l>
      <l n="83">“ Affront thy patron , and with us depart ?—</l>
      <l n="84">“ Lo ! for thy crimes , and not our own , we die ;</l>
      <l n="85">“ Mark , how the wild waves threaten from on high ,</l>
      <l n="86">“ Our sails in fragments flit before the blast ,</l>
      <l n="87">“ Scarce to its station we confine the mast ;</l>
      <l n="88">“ What shall we do , unhappy man , declare ,</l>
      <l n="89">“ How shall we act , or how direct our prayer ,</l>
      <l n="90">“ That angry Neptune may his rage restrain ,</l>
      <l n="91">“ And hush once more these tumults of the main ? ”</l>
      <l n="92">The seer reply 'd , “ The means are in your power</l>
      <l n="93">“ To still the tempest in this dreadful hour :—</l>
      <l n="94">“ High on the sea-beat prow will I ascend ,</l>
      <l n="95">“ And let the boldest of your crew attend</l>
      <l n="96">“ To plunge me headlong from that giddy steep</l>
      <l n="97">“ Down to the bosom of the unfathom 'd deep ;</l>
      <l n="98">“ So shall the ocean from its raging cease ,</l>
      <l n="99">“ And the fierce tempest soon be hush 'd to peace :—</l>
      <l n="100">“ ‘ Tis for my crimes this angry ocean raves ,</l>
      <l n="101">“ ‘ Tis for my sin we plough these fearful waves ;</l>
      <l n="102">“ Dislodge me soon — the storm shall then decay ,</l>
      <l n="103">“ Which still grows louder while on board I stay . ”</l>
      <l n="104">Thus he — but they , to save their vagrant guest ,</l>
      <l n="105">Refus 'd as yet to grant his strange request ,</l>
      <l n="106">And though aloft on mountain waves they ride ,</l>
      <l n="107">And the tost galley reels from side to side ,</l>
      <l n="108">Yet to their breasts they drew the sweepy oar ,</l>
      <l n="109">And vainly strove to gain the distant shore :</l>
      <l n="110">The ruffian winds refuse that wish 'd retreat ,</l>
      <l n="111">And fiercer o'er the decks the billows beat .</l>
      <l n="112">Then to the skies the chief his prayer addrest ,</l>
      <l n="113">“ Thou Jove supreme , the greatest and the best !</l>
      <l n="114">“ Because thy sovereign pleasure doth require</l>
      <l n="115">“ That death alone must satisfy thine ire ,</l>
      <l n="116">“ O spare us for thy dying prophet 's sake ,</l>
      <l n="117">“ Nor let us perish for the life we take ;</l>
      <l n="118">“ If we are wrong , his lot was thy decree ,</l>
      <l n="119">“ And thou hast done as it seem 'd best to thee . ”</l>
      <l n="120">Then from the summit of the washy prow ,</l>
      <l n="121">They plunged the prophet to the depths below ,</l>
      <l n="122">And straight the winds , and straight the billows cease ,</l>
      <l n="123">And every threatening surge lay hush 'd in peace ;</l>
      <l n="124">The trembling crew adore the Power Supreme</l>
      <l n="125">Who kindly thus from ruin rescued them ;</l>
      <l n="126">Their vows they send to his imperial throne ,</l>
      <l n="127">And victims offer to this God unknown .</l>

      <l n="128">When from the prow 's intimidating height</l>

      <l n="223">His lords and nobles , now repentant grown ,</l>
      <l n="224">With equal grief their various sins bemoan ,</l>
      <l n="225">And through the city sent this loud decree ,</l>
      <l n="226">With threatening back 'd , and dreadful penalty :</l>
      <l n="227">“ Ye Ninevites ! your wonted food refrain ,</l>
      <l n="228">“ Nor touch , ye beasts , the herbage of the plain ,</l>
      <l n="229">“ Let all that live be humbled to the dust ,</l>
      <l n="230">“ Nor taste the waters , though ye die of thirst ;</l>
      <l n="231">“ Let men and beasts the garb of sorrow wear ,</l>
      <l n="232">“ And beg yon ’ skies these guilty walls to spare :</l>
      <l n="233">“ Let all repent the evil they pursue ,</l>
      <l n="234">“ And curse the mischief that their hands would do —</l>
      <l n="235">“ Perhaps that God , who leans to mercy still ,</l>
      <l n="236">“ And sent a prophet to declare his will ,</l>
      <l n="237">“ May yet the vengeance he designs , adjourn ,</l>
      <l n="238">“ And , ere we perish , from his anger turn . ”</l>
      <l n="239">Jehovah heard , and pleas 'd beheld at last</l>
      <l n="240">Their deep repentance for transgressions past ,</l>
      <l n="241">With pity moved , he heard the earnest prayer</l>
      <l n="242">Of this vast city , humbled in despair ;</l>
      <l n="243">Though justly due , his anger dies away ,</l>
      <l n="244">He bids the angel of destruction stay :—</l>
      <l n="245">The obedient angel hears the high command ,</l>
      <l n="246">And sheathes the sword , he drew to smite the land .</l>

      <l n="247">But anger swell 'd the haughty prophet 's breast ,</l>
      <l n="248">Rage burn 'd within , and robb 'd his soul of rest ;</l>
      <l n="249">Such was his pride , he wish 'd they all in flame</l>
      <l n="250">Might rather perish than belie his fame ,</l>
      <l n="251">And God 's own bolts the tottering towers assail ,</l>
      <l n="252">And millions perish , than his word should fail .</l>
      <l n="253">Then to the heavens he sent this peevish prayer —</l>
      <l n="254">( Vain , impious man , to send such pinings there ):</l>
      <l n="255">“ While yet within my native land , I stay 'd ,</l>
      <l n="256">“ This would at last reward my toil , I said ,</l>
      <l n="257">“ Destruction through the Assyrian streets to cry ,</l>
      <l n="258">“ And then the event my mission falsify ;</l>
      <l n="259">“ For this I strove to shun thy sight before ,</l>
      <l n="260">“ And sought repose upon a foreign shore ;</l>
      <l n="261">“ I knew thou wert so gracious and so kind ,</l>
      <l n="262">“ Such mercy sways thy all creating mind ,</l>
      <l n="263">“ Averse thy bolts of vengeance to employ ,</l>
      <l n="264">“ And still relenting when you should'st destroy ,</l>
      <l n="265">“ That when I had declar 'd thy sacred will ,</l>
      <l n="266">“ Thou would'st not what I prophesy 'd fulfil ,</l>
      <l n="267">“ But leave me thus to scorn , contempt , and shame ,</l>
      <l n="268">“ A lying prophet , blasted in my fame —</l>
      <l n="269">“ And now , I pray thee , grant my last request ,</l>
      <l n="270">“ O take my life , so wretched and unblest !</l>
      <l n="271">“ If here I stay , ‘ tis but to grieve and sigh ;</l>
      <l n="272">“ Then take my life — ‘ tis better far to die ! ”</l>
      <l n="273">“ Is it thy place to swell with rage and pride ,</l>
      <l n="274">“ ( Thus to his pining prophet , God reply 'd )</l>
      <l n="275">“ Say is it just thy heart should burn with ire</l>
      <l n="276">“ Because yon ’ city is not wrapt in fire ?</l>
      <l n="277">“ What if I choose its ruin to delay ,</l>
      <l n="278">“ And send destruction on some future day ,</l>

      <l n="280">“ And , hostile to my pleasure , wish to die ? ”</l>
      <l n="281">Then Jonah parted from the mourning town ,</l>
      <l n="282">And near its eastern limits sate him down ,</l>
      <l n="283">A booth he builded with assiduous care ,</l>
      <l n="284">( Form 'd of the cypress boughs that flourish 'd there )</l>
      <l n="285">And anxious now beneath their shadow lay ,</l>
      <l n="286">Waiting the issue of the fortieth day —</l>
      <l n="287">As yet uncertain if the Power Divine</l>
      <l n="288">Or would to mercy , or to wrath incline —</l>
      <l n="289">Meantime the leaves that roof 'd his arbour o'er ,</l>
      <l n="290">Shrunk up and faded , sheltered him no more ;</l>
      <l n="291">But God ordain 'd a thrifty gourd to rise ,</l>
      <l n="292">To screen his prophet from the scorching skies ;</l>
      <l n="293">High o'er his head aspired the spreading leaf ,</l>
      <l n="294">Too fondly meant to mitigate his grief .</l>
      <l n="295">So close a foliage o'er his head was made ,</l>
      <l n="296">That not a beam could pierce the happy shade :</l>
      <l n="297">The wondering seer perceiv 'd the branches grow</l>
      <l n="298">And bless 'd the shadow that reliev 'd his woe ;</l>
      <l n="299">But when the next bright morn began to shine</l>
      <l n="300">( So God ordain 'd ) a worm attack 'd the vine ,</l>
      <l n="301">Beneath his bite its goodly leaves decay ,</l>
      <l n="302">And wasting , withering , die before the day !</l>
      <l n="303">Then as the lamp of heaven still higher rose</l>
      <l n="304">From eastern skies a sultry tempest blows ,</l>
      <l n="305">The vertic sun as fiercely pour 'd his ray ,</l>
      <l n="306">And beam 'd around insufferable day .</l>
      <l n="307">How beat those beams on Jonah 's fainting head !</l>
      <l n="308">How oft he wish 'd a place among the dead !</l>
      <l n="309">All he could do , was now to grieve and sigh ,</l>
      <l n="310">His life detest , and beg of God to die .</l>
      <l n="311">Again , Jehovah to his prophet said ,</l>
      <l n="312">“ Art thou so angry for thy vanish 'd shade —</l>
      <l n="313">“ For a mere shadow dost thou well to grieve ,</l>
      <l n="314">“ For this poor loss would'st thou thy being leave ? ” —</l>
      <l n="315">“ My rage is just , ( the frantic prophet cry 'd ) ,</l>
      <l n="316">“ My last , my only comfort is deny 'd —</l>
      <l n="317">“ The spreading vine that form 'd my leafy bower ;</l>
      <l n="318">“ Behold it vanish 'd in the needful hour !</l>
      <l n="319">“ To beating winds and sultry suns a prey ,</l>
      <l n="320">“ My fainting spirit droops and dies away —</l>
      <l n="321">“ Give me a mansion in my native dust ,</l>
      <l n="322">“ For though I die with rage , my rage is just . ”</l>
      <l n="323">Once more the Almighty deign 'd to make reply —</l>
      <l n="324">“ Does this lost gourd thy sorrow swell so high ,</l>
      <l n="325">“ Whose friendly shade not to thy toil was due ,</l>
      <l n="326">“ Alone it sprouted and alone it grew ;</l>
      <l n="327">“ A night beheld its branches waving high ,</l>
      <l n="328">“ And the next sun beheld those branches die ;</l>
      <l n="329">“ And should not pity move the Lord of all</l>
      <l n="330">“ To spare the vast Assyrian capital ,</l>
      <l n="331">“ Within whose walls uncounted myriads stray ,</l>
      <l n="332">“ Their Father I , my sinful offspring they ?—</l>
      <l n="333">“ Should they not move the creating mind</l>
      <l n="334">“ With six score thousand of the infant kind ,</l>
      <l n="335">“ And herds untold that graze the spacious field ,</l>
      <l n="336">“ For whom yon ’ meads their stores of fragrance yield ;</l>
      <l n="337">“ Should I this royal city wrap in flame ,</l>
      <l n="338">“ And slaughter millions to support thy fame ,</l>
      <l n="339">“ When now repentant to their God they turn ,</l>
      <l n="340">“ And their past follies , low in ashes , mourn ?—</l>
      <l n="341">“ Vain , thoughtless wretch , recall thy weak request ,</l>
      <l n="342">“ Death never came to man a welcome guest ;—</l>
      <l n="343">“ Why wish to die — what madness prompts thy mind ?</l>
      <l n="344">“ Too long the days of darkness thou shalt find ;</l>
      <l n="345">“ Life was a blessing by thy Maker meant ,</l>
      <l n="346">“ Dost thou despise the blessings he has lent —</l>
      <l n="347">“ Enjoy my gifts while yet the seasons run</l>
      <l n="348">“ True to their months , and social with the sun ;</l>
      <l n="349">“ When to the dust my mandate bids thee fall ,</l>
      <l n="350">“ All these are lost , for death conceals them all —</l>
      <l n="351">“ No more the sun illumes the sprightly day ,</l>
      <l n="352">“ The seasons vanish , and the stars decay :</l>
      <l n="353">“ The trees , the flowers , no more thy sense delight ,</l>
      <l n="354">“ Death shades them all in ever-during night .</l>
      <l n="355">“ Then think not long the little space I lent —</l>
      <l n="356">“ Of thy own sins , like Nineveh , repent ;</l>
      <l n="357">“ Rejoice at last the mighty change to see ,</l>
      <l n="358">“ And bear with them as I have borne with thee . ”</l>

    <head>PRELIMINARY PARTICULARS</head>
     <l n="1">Sprung from a race that had long till 'd the soil ,</l>
     <l n="2">And first disrobed it of its native trees ,</l>
     <l n="3">He wish 'd to heir their lands , but not their toil ,</l>
     <l n="4">And thought the ploughman 's life no life of ease ;—</l>
     <l n="5">“ ‘ Tis wrong ( said he ) these pretty hands to wound</l>
     <l n="6">“ With felling oaks , or delving in the ground :</l>
     <l n="7">“ I , who at least have forty pounds in cash</l>
     <l n="8">“ And in a country store might cut a dash ,</l>
     <l n="9">“ Why should I till these barren fields ( he said )</l>
     <l n="10">“ I who have learnt to cypher , write and read ,</l>
     <l n="11">“ These fields that shrubs , and weeds , and brambles bear ,</l>
     <l n="12">“ That pay me not , and only bring me care ! ”</l>
     <l n="13">Some thoughts had he , long while , to quit the sod ,</l>
     <l n="14">In sea-port towns to try his luck in trade ,</l>
     <l n="15">But , then , their ways of living seem 'd most odd —</l>
     <l n="16">For dusty streets to leave his native shade ,</l>
     <l n="17">From grassy plats to pebbled walks removed —</l>
     <l n="18">The more he thought of them , the less he loved :</l>
     <l n="19">The city springs he could not drink , and still</l>
     <l n="20">Preferr 'd the fountain near some bushy hill :</l>
     <l n="21">And yet no splendid objects there were seen ,</l>
     <l n="22">No distant hills , in gaudy colours clad ,</l>
     <l n="23">Look where you would , the prospect was but mean ,</l>
     <l n="24">Scrub oaks , and scatter 'd pines , and willows sad —</l>
     <l n="25">Banks of a shallow river , stain 'd with mud ;</l>
     <l n="26">A stream , where never swell 'd the tide of flood ,</l>
     <l n="27">Nor lofty ship her topsails did unlose ,</l>
     <l n="28">Nor sailor sail 'd , except in long canoes .</l>
     <l n="29">It would have puzzled Faustus , to have told ,</l>
     <l n="30">What did attach him to this paltry spot ;</l>
     <l n="31">Where even the house he heir 'd was very old ,</l>
     <l n="32">And all its outworks hardly worth a groat :</l>
     <l n="33">Yet so it was , the fancy took his brain</l>
     <l n="34">A country shop might here some custom gain :</l>
     <l n="35">Whiskey , he knew , would always be in vogue ,</l>
     <l n="36">While there are country squires to take a cogue ,</l>
     <l n="37">Laces and lawns would draw each rural maid ,</l>

    <head>THE SHOP DESCRIBED AND THE MERCHANT 'S OUTSET</head>
     <l n="1">Hard by the road a pigmy building stood ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thatch 'd was its roof , and earthen were its floors ;</l>
     <l n="3">So small its size , that , in a jesting mood ,</l>
     <l n="4">It might be call 'd a house turn 'd out of doors —</l>
     <l n="5">Yet here , adjacent to an aged oak ,</l>
     <l n="6">Full fifty years old dad his hams did smoke ,</l>
     <l n="7">Nor ceas 'd the trade , ‘ till worn with years and spent ,</l>
     <l n="8">To Pluto 's smoke-house he , himself , was sent .</l>
     <l n="9">Hither our merchant turn 'd his curious eye ,</l>
     <l n="10">And mused awhile upon this sable shell ;</l>
     <l n="11">“ Here father smoked his hogs ( he said ) and why</l>
     <l n="12">“ In truth , may not our garret do as well ? ”</l>
     <l n="13">So , down he took his hams and bacon flitches ,</l>
     <l n="14">Resolv 'd to fill the place with other riches ;</l>
     <l n="15">From every hole and cranny brush 'd the soot ,</l>
     <l n="16">And fixt up shelves throughout the crazy hut ;</l>
     <l n="17">A counter , too , most cunningly was plann 'd ,</l>
     <l n="18">Behind whose breast-work none but he might stand ,</l>
     <l n="19">Excepting now and then , by special grace ,</l>
     <l n="20">Some brother merchant from some other place .</l>
     <l n="21">Now , muster 'd up his cash , and said his prayers ,</l>
     <l n="22">In Sunday suit he rigs himself for town ,</l>
     <l n="23">Two raw-boned steeds ( design 'd for great affairs )</l>
     <l n="24">Are to the waggon hitch 'd , old Bay and Brown ;</l>
     <l n="25">Who ne'er had been before a league from home ,</l>
     <l n="26">But now are doom 'd full many a mile to roam ,</l>
     <l n="27">Like merchant-ships , a various freight to bring</l>
     <l n="28">Of ribbons , lawns , and many a tawdry thing .</l>
     <l n="29">Molasses too , blest sweet , was not forgot ,</l>
     <l n="30">And island Rum , that every taste delights ,</l>
     <l n="31">And teas , for maid and matron must be bought ,</l>
     <l n="32">Rosin and catgut strings for fiddling wights —</l>
     <l n="33">But why should I his invoice here repeat ?</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Twould be like counting grains in pecks of wheat .</l>
     <l n="35">Half Europe 's goods were on his invoice found ,</l>
     <l n="36">And all was to be bought with forty pound !</l>
     <l n="37">Soon as the early dawn proclaim 'd the day ,</l>
     <l n="38">He cock 'd his hat with pins , and comb 'd his hair :</l>
     <l n="39">Curious it was , and laughable to see</l>
     <l n="40">The village-merchant , mounted in his chair :</l>
     <l n="41">Shelves , piled with lawns and linens , in his head ,</l>
     <l n="42">Coatings and stuffs , and cloths , and scarlets red —</l>
     <l n="43">All that would suit man , woman , girl , or boy ;</l>
     <l n="44">Muslins and muslinets , jeans , grograms , corduroy .</l>
     <l n="45">Alack ! said I , he little , little dreams</l>
     <l n="46">That all the cash he guards with studious care —</l>
     <l n="47">His cash ! the mother of a thousand schemes ,</l>
     <l n="48">Will hardly buy a load of earthen ware !</l>
     <l n="49">But why should I excite the hidden tear</l>
     <l n="50">By whispering truths ungrateful to his ear ;</l>
     <l n="51">Still let him travel on , with scheming pate ,</l>
     <l n="52">As disappointment never comes too late .—</l>

    <head>HIS JOURNEY TO THE METROPOLIS ; AND MERCANTILE TRANSACTIONS</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Through woods obscure and rough perplexing ways ,</l>
     <l n="2">Slow and alone , he urged the clumsy wheel ;</l>
     <l n="3">Now stopping short , to let his horses graze ,</l>
     <l n="4">Now treating them with straw and Indian meal :</l>
     <l n="5">At length a lofty steeple caught his eye ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Higher ( thought he ) than ever kite did fly :—</l>
     <l n="7">But so it is , these churchmen are so proud</l>
     <l n="8">They ever will be climbing to a cloud ;</l>
     <l n="9">Bound on a sky-blue cruise , they always rig</l>
     <l n="10">The longest steeple , and the largest wig . ”</l>
     <l n="11">Now safe arrived upon the pebbled way ,</l>
     <l n="12">Where well-born steeds the rattling coaches trail ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where shops on shops are seen — and ladies gay</l>
     <l n="14">Walk with their curtains some , and some their veil ;</l>
     <l n="15">Where sons of art their various labors shew</l>
     <l n="16">And one cries fish ! and one cries muffins ho !</l>
     <l n="17">Amaz 'd , alike , the merchant , and his pair</l>
     <l n="18">Of scare-crow steeds , did nothing else but stare ;</l>
     <l n="19">So new was all the scene , that , smit with awe ,</l>
     <l n="20">They grinn 'd , and gaz 'd , and gap 'd at all they saw ,</l>
     <l n="21">And often stopp 'd , to ask at every door ,</l>
     <l n="22">“ Sirs , can you tell us where 's the cheapest store ! ”</l>
     <l n="23">“ The cheapest store ( a sly retailer said )</l>
     <l n="24">“ Cheaper than cheap , guid faith , I have to sell ;</l>
     <l n="25">“ Here are some colour 'd cloths that never fade :</l>
     <l n="26">“ No other shop can serve you half so well ;</l>
     <l n="27">“ Wanting some money now , to pay my rent ,</l>
     <l n="28">“ I 'll sell them at a loss of ten per cent .—</l>
     <l n="29">“ Hum-hums are here — and muslins — what you please —</l>
     <l n="30">“ Bandanas , baftas , pullcats , India teas ;</l>
     <l n="31">“ Improv 'd by age , and now grown very old ,</l>
     <l n="32">“ And given away , you may depend — not sold ! ”</l>
     <l n="33">Lured by the bait the wily shopman laid ,</l>
     <l n="34">He gave his steeds their mess of straw and meal ,</l>
     <l n="35">Then gazing round the shop , thus , cautious said ,</l>
     <l n="36">“ Well , if you sell so cheap , I think we 'll deal ;</l>
     <l n="37">“ But pray remember , ‘ tis for goods I 'm come ,</l>
     <l n="38">“ For , as to polecats , we 've enough at home —</l>
     <l n="39">“ Full forty pounds I have , and that in gold</l>
     <l n="40">“ ( Enough to make a trading man look bold )</l>
     <l n="41">“ Unrig your shelves , and let me take a peep ;</l>
     <l n="42">“ ‘ Tis odds I leave them bare , you sell so cheap . ”</l>
     <l n="43">The city merchant stood , with lengthen 'd jaws ;</l>
     <l n="44">And stared awhile , then made this short reply —</l>
     <l n="45">“ You clear my shelves ! ( he said ) — this trunk of gauze</l>
     <l n="46">“ Is more than all your forty pounds can buy :—</l>
     <l n="47">“ On yonder board , whose burthen seems so small</l>
     <l n="48">“ That one man 's pocket might contain it all ,</l>
     <l n="49">“ More value lies , than you and all your race</l>
     <l n="50">“ From Adam down , could purchase or possess . ”</l>
     <l n="51">Convinced , he turn 'd him to another street ,</l>

    <head>THE MERCHANT 'S RETURN</head>
     <l n="1">Returning far o'er many a hill and stone</l>
     <l n="2">And much in dread his earthen ware would break ,</l>
     <l n="3">Thoughtful he rode , and uttering many a groan</l>
     <l n="4">Lest at some worm-hole vent his cask should leak —</l>
     <l n="5">His cask , that held the joys of rural squire</l>
     <l n="6">Which even , ‘ twas said , the parson did admire ,</l>
     <l n="7">And valued more than all the dusty pages</l>
     <l n="8">That Calvin penn 'd , and fifty other sages —</l>
     <l n="9">Once high in fame — beprais 'd in verse and prose ,</l>

     <l n="11">At dusk of eve he reach 'd his old abode ,</l>

     <l n="15">While on his cask each glanced a loving eye ,</l>
     <l n="16">Patient , to all he gave a brisk reply —</l>

     <l n="18">What wonders in the town detain 'd his stay —</l>
     <l n="19">“ Houses as high as yonder white-oak tree</l>

     <l n="3">Jove has on none unmingled bliss bestow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">But disappointment is the lot of all :</l>
     <l n="5">Thieves rob our stores , in spite of locks and keys ,</l>
     <l n="6">Cats steal our cream , and rats infest our cheese ,</l>
     <l n="7">The gayest coat a grease-spot may assail ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or Susan pin a dish-clout to its tail ,—</l>
     <l n="9">Our village-merchant ( trust me ) had his share</l>
     <l n="10">Of vile mis-haps — for now , the goods unpackt ,</l>
     <l n="11">Discover 'd , what might make a deacon swear ,</l>
     <l n="12">Jugs , cream-pots , pipes , and grog-bowls sadly crackt —</l>
     <l n="13">A general groan throughout the crowd was heard ;</l>
     <l n="14">Most pitied him , and some his ruin fear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="15">Poor wight ! ‘ twas sad to see him fret and chafe ,</l>
     <l n="16">While each enquir 'd , “ Sir , is the rum-cask safe ? ”</l>
     <l n="17">Alas ! even that some mischief had endured ;—</l>
     <l n="18">One rascal hoop had started near the chine !—</l>
     <l n="19">Then curiously the bung-hole they explored ,</l>
     <l n="20">With stem of pipe , the leakage to define —</l>
     <l n="21">Five gallons must be charged to loss and gain !—</l>
     <l n="22">“ — Five gallons ! ( cry 'd the merchant , writh 'd with pain )</l>
     <l n="23">“ Now may the cooper never see full flask ,</l>
     <l n="24">“ But still be driving at an empty cask —</l>
     <l n="25">“ Five gallons might have mellowed down the ‘ squire</l>
     <l n="26">“ And made the captain strut a full inch higher ;</l>
     <l n="27">“ Five gallons might have prompted many a song ,</l>
     <l n="28">“ And made a frolic more than five days long :</l>
     <l n="29">“ Five gallons now are lost , and — sad to think ,</l>
     <l n="30">“ That when they leak 'd — no soul was there to drink ! ”</l>
     <l n="31">Now , slightly treated with a proof-glass dram ,</l>
     <l n="32">Each neighbour took his leave , and went to bed ,</l>
     <l n="33">All but our merchant : he , with grief o'ercome ,</l>
     <l n="34">Revolv 'd strange notions in his scheming head —</l>
     <l n="35">“ For losses such as these , ( thought he ) ‘ tis meant ,</l>
     <l n="36">“ That goods are sold at twenty-five per cent :</l>
     <l n="37">“ No doubt these trading men know what is just ,</l>
     <l n="38">“ ‘ Tis twenty-five times what they cost at first ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">So rigging off his shelves by light of candle ,</l>
     <l n="40">The dismal smoke-house walls began to shine :</l>
     <l n="41">Here , stood his tea-pots — some without a handle —</l>
     <l n="42">A broken jar — and there his keg of wine ;</l>
     <l n="43">Pipes , many a dozen , ordered in a row ;</l>
     <l n="44">Jugs , mugs , and grog-bowls — less for sale than show :</l>
     <l n="45">The leaky cask , replenish 'd from the well ,</l>
     <l n="46">Roll 'd to its birth — but we no tales will tell .—</l>
     <l n="47">Catching the eye in elegant display ,</l>
     <l n="48">All was arranged and snug , by break of day :</l>
     <l n="49">The blue dram-bottle , on the counter plac 'd ,</l>
     <l n="50">Stood , all prepared for him that buys to taste ;—</l>
     <l n="51">Sure bait ! by which the man of cash is taken ,</l>
     <l n="52">As rats are caught by cheese or scraps of bacon .</l>
     <l n="53">Now from all parts the rural people ran ,</l>
     <l n="54">With ready cash , to buy what might be bought :</l>
     <l n="55">One went to choose a pot , and one a pan ,</l>
     <l n="56">And they that had no pence their produce brought ,</l>
     <l n="57">A hog , a calf , safe halter 'd by the neck ;</l>
     <l n="58">Potatoes ( Ireland 's glory ) many a peck ;</l>
     <l n="59">Bacon and cheese , of real value more</l>
     <l n="60">Than India 's gems , or all Potosi 's ore .</l>
     <l n="61">Some questions ask 'd , the folks began to stare —</l>
     <l n="62">No soul would purchase , pipe , or pot , or pan :</l>
     <l n="63">Each shook his head — hung back — “ Your goods so dear !</l>
     <l n="64">“ In fact ( said they ) the devil 's in the man !</l>
     <l n="65">“ Rum ne'er shall meet my lips ( cry 'd honest Sam )</l>
     <l n="66">“ In shape of toddy , punch , grog , sling , or dram ;</l>
     <l n="67">“ No cash of mine you 'll get ( said pouting Kate )</l>
     <l n="68">“ While gauze is valued at so dear a rate . ”</l>
     <l n="69">Thus things dragg 'd on for many a tedious day ;</l>
     <l n="70">No custom came ; and nought but discontent</l>
     <l n="71">Gloom 'd through the shop .— “ Well , let them have their way ,</l>
     <l n="72">( The merchant said ) I 'll sell at cent per cent ,</l>
     <l n="73">“ By which , ‘ tis plain , I scarce myself can save ,</l>
     <l n="74">“ For cent per cent is just the price I gave . ”</l>
     <l n="75">“ Now ! ( cry 'd the squire who still had kept his pence )</l>
     <l n="76">“ Now , Sir , you reason like a man of sense !</l>
     <l n="77">“ Custom will now from every quarter come ;</l>
     <l n="78">“ In joyous streams shall flow the inspiring rum ,</l>
     <l n="79">“ ‘ Till every soul in pleasing dreams be sunk ,</l>
     <l n="80">“ And even our Socrates himself — is drunk ! ”</l>
     <l n="81">Soon were the shelves disburthen 'd of their load ;</l>
     <l n="82">In three short hours the kegs of wine ran dry —</l>
     <l n="83">Swift from its tap even dull molasses flow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="84">Each saw the rum cask wasting , with a sigh —</l>
     <l n="85">The farce concluded , as it was foreseen —</l>
     <l n="86">With empty shelves — long trust — and law suits keen —</l>
     <l n="87">The woods resounding with a curse on trade ,—</l>
     <l n="88">An empty purse — sour looks — and hanging head .—</l>

    <head>THE MONUMENT OF PHAON<span type="note_anchor">[ 33 ]</span></head>
     <l n="1">Written 1770 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Phaon , the admirer of Sappho , both of the isle of Lesbos , privately forsook this first object of his affections , and set out to visit foreign countries . Sappho , after having long mourned his absence ( which is the subject of one of Ovid 's finest epistles ) , is here supposed to fall into the company of Ismenius a traveller , who informs her that he saw the tomb of a certain Phaon in Sicily , erected to his memory by a lady of the island , and gives her the inscriptions , hinting to her that , in all probability , it belonged to the same person she bemoans . She thereupon , in a fit of rage and despair , throws herself from the famous Leucadian rock , and perishes in the gulph below .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>The first trace that I can find of this poem is in the Freeman 's Journal of May 18 , 1785 . I have little doubt that it is the “ Stanzas on an Ancient Dutch House on Long Island , ” mentioned in 1773 in a letter to Madison as forming a part of Freneau 's publication , “ The American Village , ” now lost . After its appearance in the Freeman 's Journal , it was widely copied . The Independent Gazetteer printed it in 1787 , introduced as follows : “ The following is copied from Perryman 's London Morning Herald of July 22 , 1787 : ‘ The Deserted Farm House , ’ written in America by Mr. Freneau , whose political productions tended considerably to keep alive the spirit of independence during the late civil war . ” I have followed the text of 1809 . The poet constantly emended this poem ; he seldom reprinted it without minor changes , usually for the better .</p>

     <l n="113">Forever from their native skies estranged . 110</l>
     <l n="114">Doubtless they made these virgin climes their own ,</l>
     <l n="115">And in the course of long revolving years</l>

The poem , given originally as the graduating address of Freneau and Brackenridge at Princeton , Brackenridge delivering it , was first published In 1772 at Philadelphia , by Joseph Crukshank , for R. Aitken , bookseller . This pamphlet edition is the only one extant of the original poem . Freneau reprinted his own part , with many modifications and additions , in the first edition of his poems , 1786 , explaining it with the following note : “ This poem is a little altered from the original ( published in Philadelphia in 1772 ) , such parts being only inserted here as were written by the author of this volume . A few more modern lines towards the conclusion are incorporated with the rest , being a supposed prophetical anticipation of subsequent events . ” The text of the edition of 1772 , which is now exceedingly rare , is as follows :</p>

     <l n="2">Or Alexandria , where the Ptolomies</l>
     <l n="3">Taught golden commerce to unfurl her sails ,</l>
     <l n="4">And bid fair science smile : No more of Greece</l>
     <l n="5">Where learning next her early visit paid ,</l>
     <l n="6">And spread her glories to illume the world ;</l>

     <l n="10">Who with resistless eloquence reviv 'd</l>
     <l n="11">The spirit of Liberty , and shook the thrones</l>
     <l n="12">Of Macedon and Persia 's haughty king .</l>
     <l n="13">No more of Rome , enlighten 'd by her beams ,</l>
     <l n="14">Fresh kindling there the fire of eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="15">And poesy divine ; imperial Rome !</l>
     <l n="16">Whose wide dominion reach 'd o'er half the globe ;</l>
     <l n="17">Whose eagle flew o'er Ganges to the East ,</l>
     <l n="18">And in the West far to the British isles .</l>
     <l n="19">No more of Britain and her kings renown 'd ,</l>

     <l n="25">Our ev'ry thought on this auspicious day ;</l>

     <l n="15">Of Atabilipa , by thirst of gold</l>
     <l n="16">Depriv 'd of life : which not Peru 's rich ore ,</l>

     <l n="6">Whether they sprang from some premoeval head</l>
     <l n="7">In their own lands , like Adam in the East ;</l>
     <l n="8">Yet this the sacred oracles deny ,</l>

     <l n="10">For when the gen'ral deluge drown 'd the world ,</l>

     <l n="15">High on the Andes , wrapt in endless snow ,</l>

     <l n="40">Of this unhappy land now sunk and lost ;</l>
     <l n="41">The islands rising in the eastern main</l>
     <l n="42">Are but small fragments of this continent ,</l>
     <l n="43">Whose two extremities were Newfoundland</l>
     <l n="44">And St . Helena .— One far in the north</l>
     <l n="45">Where British seamen now with strange surprise</l>
     <l n="46">Behold the pole star glitt'ring o'er their heads ;</l>
     <l n="47">The other in the southern tropic rears</l>

     <l n="50">With fam 'd Hibernia are but broken parts</l>

     <l n="3">On hidden things , merely because they 're hid ;</l>

   <p>The 1786 edition , which was evolved with such great changes from the original version , furnished the text of the 1795 edition . There were some twenty variations and three added lines , viz ., lines 354 , 427 , 438 . Line 265 was changed from “ Which full enjoyment only finds for fools , ” to its final form ; line 352 was changed from “ A thousand kingdoms rais 'd ; ” line 360 , from “ Our Alexanders , Pompeys , heroes , kings ; ” line 371 , from “ One monarchy ; ” and 461 , from “ Death 's ancient . ” The other changes were largely verbal , nearly all being for the better . For the edition of 1809 , Freneau used the 1795 text , with some twenty-one variations and one added line , viz ., line 67 . These variations , which nearly all concern single words , are generally not at all for the better : for instance , “ Shackle , ” in line 343 , is changed to “ people ; ” “ our sons , ” in line 365 , is changed to “ a race ; ” “ were born , ” in 367 , to “ we exist ; ” and “ strumpets , ” in 409 , to “ vagrants . ” Freneau 's notes in the various editions were as follows :</p>

     <l n="22">How govern our actions , or rule at our birth ?</l>

     <l n="31">Dear girl ! if you wait ‘ till the planets are for us</l>
     <l n="32">Your name will scarce alter to Tryphena Taurus .</l>
     <l n="33">Tryphena ! I love you — have courted you long —</l>
     <l n="34">But find all my labours will end in a song !—</l>
     <l n="35">“ Will you play at all-fours ? ” — she said , very jolly ;—</l>
     <l n="36">I answered , The play at all-fours is all folly !</l>
     <l n="37">“ Will you play , then , at whist ? ” — she obligingly said ;—</l>
     <l n="38">I answered , the game is gone out of my head —</l>
     <l n="39">Indeed , I am weary — I feel rather sick ,</l>
     <l n="40">So , I leave you , Tryphena , to win the odd trick .—</l>
     <l n="41">There 's a music some talk of , that 's play 'd by the spheres :—</l>
     <l n="42">I wish him all luck who this harmony hears ;</l>
     <l n="43">And the people who hear it , I hope they may find</l>
     <l n="44">It is not a music that fills them with wind .—</l>
     <l n="45">There 's Saturn , and Venus , and Jove , and the rest :</l>
     <l n="46">Their music to me is not quite of the best .—</l>
     <l n="47">These orbs of the stars , and that globe of the moon</l>
     <l n="48">To me , I am certain , all play a wrong tune .</l>
     <l n="49">Not a creature that plods in , or ploughs up the dirt ,</l>
     <l n="50">But from the mean clod gets a better support :</l>
     <l n="51">Then farewell to Mars , and the rest of the gang ,</l>
     <l n="52">And the comets — I tell them they all may go hang ;</l>
     <l n="53">I mean , if they only with music will treat ,</l>
     <l n="54">It is not to me the best cooked of all meat .</l>
     <l n="55">They may go where they will , and return when they please ,—</l>
     <l n="56">And I hope they 'll remember to pay up my fees —</l>
     <l n="57">So I leave them awhile , to be cheerful below ,</l>
     <l n="58">And away to Passaick most merrily go !</l>
     <l n="59">The month , it was August , and meltingly warm ,</l>
     <l n="60">Not a cloud in the sky nor the sign of a storm ;</l>
     <l n="61">So I jumped in the stage , with the freight of the fair ,</l>
     <l n="62">And in less than a day at Passaick we were .—</l>
     <l n="63">Well , arrived at the Falls , I procured me a bed</l>
     <l n="64">In a box of a house — you might call it a shed ;</l>
     <l n="65">The best of the taverns were all pre-engaged ,</l>
     <l n="66">So I barely was lodged , or rather encaged ;</l>
     <l n="67">Yet , cage as it was , I enjoyed a regale</l>
     <l n="68">Of victuals three times every day , without fail :</l>
     <l n="69">There was poultry , and pyes , and a dozen things more</l>
     <l n="70">That the damnable college had never in store :</l>
     <l n="71">I feasted , and lived on such fat of the place</l>
     <l n="72">That the college would not have remembered my face —</l>
     <l n="73">So long had I fed on their trash algebraic ,</l>
     <l n="74">Indeed , it was time I went to Passaick !—</l>
     <l n="75">The rocks were amazing , and such was the height ,</l>
     <l n="76">They struck me at once with surprize and delight .</l>
     <l n="77">The waters rushed down with a terrible roar —</l>
     <l n="78">What a pleasure it was to be lounging on shore !</l>
     <l n="79">They now were as clear as old Helicon 's stream ,</l>
     <l n="80">Or as clear as the clearest in poetry 's dream .—</l>
     <l n="81">These falls were stupendous , the fountains so clear ,</l>
     <l n="82">That another Narcissus might see himself here ,</l>
     <l n="83">Nor only Narcissus — some ill-featured faces</l>
     <l n="84">From the springs were reflected — not made up of graces .</l>
     <l n="85">But now I must tell you — what people were met :</l>
     <l n="86">They were , on my conscience , a wonderful sett ;</l>
     <l n="87">Some came for their health , and some came for their pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="88">And to steal from the city a fortnight of leisure ;</l>
     <l n="89">Some came for a day , and yet more for a week ,</l>
     <l n="90">Some came from the college , tormented with Greek ,</l>
     <l n="91">To continue as long as their means would afford ,</l>
     <l n="92">That is , while the taverns would trust them their board :</l>
     <l n="93">( Of this last mentioned class , I confess I was one ,</l>
     <l n="94">For why should I fib when the mischief is done ? )</l>
     <l n="95">This age may decay , and another may rise ,</l>
     <l n="96">Before it is fully revealed to our eyes ,</l>
     <l n="97">That Latin , and Hebrew , Chaldaic , and Greek ,</l>
     <l n="98">To the shades of oblivion must certainly sneak ;</l>
     <l n="99">Too much of our time is employed on such trash</l>
     <l n="100">When we ought to be taught to accumulate cash .</l>
     <l n="101">Supposing I knew them as pat as my prayers</l>
     <l n="102">( And to know them completely would cost me twelve years )</l>
     <l n="103">Supposing , I say , I had Virgil by rote ,</l>
     <l n="104">And could talk with old Homer — ‘ tis not worth a groat ;</l>
     <l n="105">If with Rabbi Bensalem I knew how to chat ,</l>
     <l n="106">Where lies the advantage ?— and what of all that ?</l>
     <l n="107">Were this cart load of learning the whole that I knew ,</l>
     <l n="108">I could sooner get forward by mending a shoe :</l>
     <l n="109">I could sooner grow rich by the axe or the spade ,</l>
     <l n="110">Or thrive by the meanest mechanical trade ,</l>
     <l n="111">The tinker himself would be richer than I ,</l>
     <l n="112">For the tinker has something that people must buy ,</l>
     <l n="113">While such as have little but Latin to vend ,</l>
     <l n="114">On a shadow may truly be said to depend ;</l>
     <l n="115">Old words , and old phrases that nothing bestow ,</l>
     <l n="116">And the owners discarded ten ages ago .—</l>
     <l n="117">Here were people on people — I hardly know who —</l>
     <l n="118">There was Mammon the merchant , and Japhet the Jew :</l>
     <l n="119">There was Slyboots the Quaker , whose coat had no flaps ,</l>
     <l n="120">With two of his Lambkins , as plain in their caps .</l>
     <l n="121">In silks of the richest I saw them array ,</l>
     <l n="122">But nothing was cut in our mode of the day ,</l>
     <l n="123">They hung to old habits as firm as to rocks ,</l>
     <l n="124">And are just what they were in the days of George Fox .</l>
     <l n="125">They talked in a style that was wholly their own ;</l>
     <l n="126">They shunned the vain world , and were mostly alone ,</l>
     <l n="127">One talked in the Nay , and one talked in the Yea ,</l>
     <l n="128">And of light in their lanthorns that no one could see :</l>
     <l n="129">They hated the crowd , and they hated the play ,</l>
     <l n="130">And hoped the vain actors would soon run away ;—</l>
     <l n="131">No follies like that would the preachers allow ;</l>
     <l n="132">And Tabitha said thee , and Rebecca said thou .</l>
     <l n="133">Here was Dullman , the broker , who looked as demure</l>
     <l n="134">As if a false key had unlocked the shop door :</l>
     <l n="135">He seemed to enjoy not a moment of rest ,</l>
     <l n="136">So unhappy to be — far away from his chest .</l>
     <l n="137">He was all on the fidgets to be with his gold :</l>
     <l n="138">Both honour and conscience he bartered , or sold —</l>
     <l n="139">The devil himself — excuse me , I pray —</l>
     <l n="140">Old Satan — oh no — take it some other way —</l>
     <l n="141">The God of this world had him fast by a chain ,</l>
     <l n="142">And there let us leave him — and let him remain .—</l>
     <l n="143">Here was Samuel , the Deacon , who read a large book ,</l>
     <l n="144">Though few but himself on its pages would look ;</l>
     <l n="145">Would you know what it was ?— an abridgement of Flavell , [ A ]</l>
     <l n="146">With Bunyan 's whole war between soul and the devil ;—</l>
     <l n="147">It seemed very old , and the worse for the wear ,</l>
     <l n="148">And might last the next century , handled with care ;</l>
     <l n="149">But if fashions and folly should not have a fall ,</l>
     <l n="150">I presume it will hardly be handled at all .—</l>
     <l n="151">Here was Nimrod the soldier — he wore a long sword ,</l>
     <l n="152">And , of course , all the ladies his courage adored ;</l>
     <l n="153">Two fringed epaulettes on his shoulders displayed ,</l>
     <l n="154">Discovered the rank of this son of the blade .</l>
     <l n="155">“ O la ! ” cried Miss Kitty , “ how bold he must be !</l>
     <l n="156">Papa ! we must beg him to join us at tea !</l>
     <l n="157">How much like a hero he looketh — good me !</l>
     <l n="158">Full many a battle , no doubt , he has stood ,</l>
     <l n="159">And waded shoe deep through a mill pond of mud !</l>
     <l n="160">What heads have been sliced from the place they possessed</l>
     <l n="161">By the sword at his side !— all , I hope , for the best ! ”</l>
     <l n="162">Then the soldier went out , to refresh at the inn —</l>
     <l n="163">Perhaps he did not — if he did it 's no sin —</l>
     <l n="164">He made his congee , and he bowed to us all ,</l>
     <l n="165">And said he was going to Liberty Hall :</l>
     <l n="166">‘ Tis certain he went , but certainly where</l>
     <l n="167">I cannot inform , and the devil may care .</l>
     <l n="168">But now to proceed , in describing in rhyme</l>
     <l n="169">The folks that came hither to pass away time :</l>
     <l n="170">There were more that had heads rather shallow than strong ,</l>
     <l n="171">And more than had money to bear them out long .</l>
     <l n="172">In short , there were many more ladies than gents ,</l>
     <l n="173">And the latter complained of the heavy expense !</l>
     <l n="174">And some I could see , with their splendour and show ,</l>
     <l n="175">That their credit was bad , and their pockets were low ;</l>
     <l n="176">Many females were gadding , I saw with concern ,</l>
     <l n="177">Who had better been knitting , or weaving their yarn .</l>
     <l n="178">And many went into Passaick to lave</l>
     <l n="179">Whose hides were , indeed , a disgrace to the wave ;</l>
     <l n="180">Who should have been home at their houses and farms ,</l>
     <l n="181">Not here to be dabbling , to shew us their charms :</l>
     <l n="182">It would have been better to wash their own walls</l>
     <l n="183">Than here — to come here , to be washed in the falls .</l>
     <l n="184">A judge of the court ( in the law a mere goose )</l>
     <l n="185">Here wasted his time with a lawyer let loose .</l>
     <l n="186">Their books were thrown by — so I begged of the fates</l>
     <l n="187">That the falls of Passaick might fall on their pates .</l>
     <l n="188">This lawyer was Ludwick , who scarce had a suit ,</l>
     <l n="189">And for once in his life was disposed to be mute ,</l>
     <l n="190">But was mostly engaged in some crazy dispute :</l>
     <l n="191">A cause against Smyth [ B ] he could never defend ,</l>
     <l n="192">As well might the Old One with Michael contend :</l>
     <l n="193">The road was before him , the country was spacious ,</l>
     <l n="194">And he knew an old fellow called fieri facias :—</l>
     <l n="195">I saw him demurr , when they asked him to pay —</l>
     <l n="196">With a noli-pros-equi he scampered away .—</l>
     <l n="197">Though his head was profusely be-plaistered with meal ,</l>
     <l n="198">One sorrowful secret it could not conceal ,</l>
     <l n="199">That he drew his first breath when a two penny star</l>
     <l n="200">Presided , and governed this son of the bar .</l>
     <l n="201">Here was Pedro , the parson , who looked full as grave</l>
     <l n="202">As it he had lodged in Trophonius 's cave .</l>
     <l n="203">He talked of his wine , and he talked of his beer ,</l>
     <l n="204">And he talked of his texts , that were not very clear ;</l>
     <l n="205">And many suspected he talked very queer .—</l>
     <l n="206">He talked with Scalpella , the inn-holder 's wife ,</l>
     <l n="207">Then dwelt on her beauties , and called her his life !—</l>
     <l n="208">He ogled Scalpella !— and spake of her charms ;</l>
     <l n="209">And oh ! how he wished to repose in her arms :</l>
     <l n="210">He called her his deary , and talked of their loves ;</l>
     <l n="211">And left her at last — a pair of old gloves !</l>
     <l n="212">I was sorry to see him deranged and perplext</l>
     <l n="213">That no one would ask him to handle a text :—</l>
     <l n="214">All gaped when he spoke , and incessantly gazed ,</l>
     <l n="215">And thought him no witch , but a parson be-crazed .</l>
     <l n="216">Fine work did he make of Millennium , I trow ,</l>
     <l n="217">Which he told us would come ( tho ’ it comes very slow )</l>
     <l n="218">When earth with the pious and just will abound</l>
     <l n="219">And Eden itself at Egg-Harbour be found :</l>
     <l n="220">No musketoes to bite us , no rats to molest ,</l>
     <l n="221">And lawyers themselves rocked into something like rest .</l>
     <l n="222">But most of us judged it was rather a whim ,</l>
     <l n="223">Or , at least , that the prospect was distant and dim .</l>
     <l n="224">So I saw him pack up his polemical gown ,</l>
     <l n="225">To retreat while he could from the noise of the town . [ C ]</l>
     <l n="226">He said there was something in Falls he admired ,</l>
     <l n="227">But of constantly hearing the roar — he was tired !</l>
     <l n="228">With their damp exhalations his fancy was dimmed ,</l>
     <l n="229">He would come the next spring with his surplice new trimmed ,</l>
     <l n="230">Besides there were fogs in the morning ( he said )</l>
     <l n="231">That rose on the river and muddled his head !—</l>
     <l n="232">Thus he quitted Passaick !— deserted her shore ,</l>
     <l n="233">And the taverns that knew him shall know him no more !</l>
     <l n="234">One farmer Milhollan — I saw him come here ,</l>
     <l n="235">Almost at the busiest time in the year ;</l>
     <l n="236">His intent might be good , but I never could learn</l>
     <l n="237">Who coaxed him away from his crib and his barn :</l>
     <l n="238">Each morning he tippled three glasses of gin</l>
     <l n="239">With as many , at least , as three devils therein .</l>
     <l n="240">He quarrelled with Jack , and he wrangled with Tom ,</l>
     <l n="241">‘ Till scarcely a negro but wished him at home ;</l>
     <l n="242">He talked over much of the badness of times ,</l>
     <l n="243">And read us a list of the governor 's [ D ] crimes ,</l>
     <l n="244">From which it was clearly predicted , and plain ,</l>
     <l n="245">That his honour would hardly be chosen again .</l>
     <l n="246">He fought with Tim Tearcoat , and cudgelled with Ben ,</l>
     <l n="247">And wrestled with Sampson — all quarrelsome men ;—</l>
     <l n="248">I was sorry to see him thus wasting his force</l>
     <l n="249">On fellows who kicked with the heels of a horse .</l>
     <l n="250">Tho ’ strong in my arms , and of strength to contest</l>
     <l n="251">With the youths of my age in the wars of the fist ,</l>
     <l n="252">I thought it was better to let them pursue</l>
     <l n="253">The quarrels they had , than to be one of their crew ;</l>
     <l n="254">I saw it was madness to join in the fray ,</l>
     <l n="255">So I left them to wrangle — each dog his own way .</l>
     <l n="256">He spoke thrice an hour of his crop that had failed ,</l>
     <l n="257">And losses , he feared , that would get him enjailed ;</l>
     <l n="258">He mentioned his poultry , and mentioned his pigs ,</l>
     <l n="259">And railed at some Tories , converted to Whigs .—</l>
     <l n="260">( Excuse me retailing so much in my rhymes</l>
     <l n="261">Of the chatt of the day and the stuff of the times ;</l>
     <l n="262">‘ Tis thus in the acts of a play , we perceive</l>
     <l n="263">All the parts are not cast to the wise , or the brave ;</l>
     <l n="264">Not all is discoursed by the famed or the fair ,</l>
     <l n="265">The demons of dullness have also their share ;</l>
     <l n="266">Statira in play-house has not all the chance ,</l>
     <l n="267">For hags are permitted to join in the dance :</l>
     <l n="268">Not Catos , or Platos engross every play ,</l>
     <l n="269">For clowns and clod-hoppers must , too , have their day ;</l>
     <l n="270">Not the nobles of nature say all that is said ,</l>
     <l n="271">And monarchs are frequently left in the shade ;</l>
     <l n="272">There must be some nonsense , to step in between ,</l>
     <l n="273">There must be some fools to enliven the scene . )</l>
     <l n="274">Here was Doctor Sangrado , with potion and pill ,</l>
     <l n="275">And his price was the same , to recover or kill .</l>
     <l n="276">He waddled about , and was vext to the soul</l>
     <l n="277">To see so much health in this horrible hole ;</l>
     <l n="278">He seemed in a fret there was nobody sick ,</l>
     <l n="279">And enquired of the landlord , “ What ails your son Dick ? ”</l>
     <l n="280">“ What ails him ? ( said Gubbins ) why nothing at all ! ”</l>
     <l n="281">“ By my soul ( said the quack ) he 's as white as the wall ;</l>
     <l n="282">I must give him a potion to keep down his gall !</l>
     <l n="283">There is bile on his stomach — I clearly see that ;</l>
     <l n="284">This night he will vomit as black as my hat :</l>
     <l n="285">Here 's a puke and a purge — twelve doses of bark ;</l>
     <l n="286">Let him swallow them all — just an hour before dark ! ”</l>
     <l n="287">“ O dear ! ( said the mother ) the lad is quite well ! ” —</l>
     <l n="288">Said the Doctor , “ No , no ! he must take calomel :</l>
     <l n="289">It will put him to rights , as I hope to be saved ! ”</l>
     <l n="290">“ Or rather ( said Gubbins ) you hope him engraved ! ”</l>
     <l n="291">So , the Doctor walked off in a pitiful plight ,</l>
     <l n="292">And he lodged in a dog-house ( they told me ) that night .</l>
     <l n="293">Here were wives , and young widows , and matrons , and maids ,</l>
     <l n="294">Who came for their health , or to stroll in the shades ;</l>
     <l n="295">Here were Nellies , and Nancies , and Hetties , by dozens ,</l>
     <l n="296">With their neighbours , and nephews , and nieces , and cousins —</l>
     <l n="297">All these had come hither to see the famed Fall ,</l>
     <l n="298">And you , pretty Sally , the best of them all .</l>
     <l n="299">Here was Saunders , the jockey , who rode a white horse ,</l>
     <l n="300">His last , it was said , and his only resource ;</l>
     <l n="301">And the landlord was careful to put us in mind</l>
     <l n="302">That hell and destruction were riding behind :</l>
     <l n="303">He often had told him , “ Do , Saunders , take care ,</l>
     <l n="304">This swilling of gin is a cursed affair :</l>
     <l n="305">Indeed — and it puts a man off from his legs ,</l>
     <l n="306">And brings us at last to be pelted with eggs —</l>
     <l n="307">The wit of your noddle should carry you through ,—</l>
     <l n="308">Break your bottle of rum — give the devil his due !</l>
     <l n="309">Keep the reason about you that nature designed ,</l>
     <l n="310">And you have the respect and regard of mankind ! ”</l>
     <l n="311">This steed of poor Saunders ’ was woefully lean ,</l>
     <l n="312">And he looked , as we thought , like the flying machine ;</l>
     <l n="313">And , in short , it appeared , by the looks of his hide ,</l>
     <l n="314">That the stables he came from were poorly supplied :</l>
     <l n="315">A bundle of bones — and they whispered it round ,</l>
     <l n="316">That he came from the hole where the Mammoth was found . [ E ]</l>
     <l n="317">They stuff 'd him with hay , and they crammed him with oats</l>
     <l n="318">While Saunders was gaming and drinking with sots :</l>
     <l n="319">( For the de'il in the shape of a bottle of rum</l>
     <l n="320">Deceived him with visions of fortune to come ;)</l>
     <l n="321">His landlady had on the horse a sheep'shYpppHeNeye ,</l>
     <l n="322">So Saunders had plenty of whiskey and pye :</l>
     <l n="323">He had gin of the best , and he treated all round ,</l>
     <l n="324">‘ Till care was dismissed and solicitude drowned ,</l>
     <l n="325">And a reckoning was brought him of more than three pound .</l>
     <l n="326">As he had not a groat in his lank looking purse ,</l>
     <l n="327">The landlord made seizure of saddle and horse :—</l>
     <l n="328">Scalpella , the hostess , cried , “ Fly from this room ,</l>
     <l n="329">Or I 'll sweep you away with my hickory broom ! ”</l>
     <l n="330">Thus Saunders sneaked off in a sorrowful way ,</l>
     <l n="331">And the Falls were his fall — to be beggar next day .—</l>
     <l n="332">The lady of ladies that governed the inn</l>
     <l n="333">Was a sharper indeed , and she kept such a din !—</l>
     <l n="334">Scalpella !— and may I remember the name !—</l>
     <l n="335">Could scratch like a tyger , or play a tight game .</l>
     <l n="336">A bludgeon she constantly held in her hand ,</l>
     <l n="337">The sign of respect , and a sign of command :</l>
     <l n="338">She could scream like a vulture , or wink like an owl ;</l>
     <l n="339">Not a dog in the street like Scalpella could howl .—</l>
     <l n="340">She was a Scalpella !— I am yet on her books ,</l>
     <l n="341">But , oh ! may I never encounter her looks !—</l>
     <l n="342">I owe her five pounds — I am that in her debt ,</l>
     <l n="343">And my dues from the stars have not cleared it off yet .</l>
     <l n="344">If she knew where I am !— I should fare very ill ;</l>
     <l n="345">Instead of some beer she would drench me with swill ;</l>
     <l n="346">I should curse and reflect on the hour I was born .—</l>
     <l n="347">If she thought I had fixed on the pitch of Cape Horn ,</l>
     <l n="348">She would find me !— Scalpella ! set down what I owe</l>
     <l n="349">In the page of bad debts — due to Scalpy and Co !—</l>
     <l n="350">Her boarders she hated , and drove with a dash ,</l>
     <l n="351">And nothing about them she liked but their cash ;</l>
     <l n="352">Except they were Tories — ah , then she was kind —</l>
     <l n="353">And said to their honours , “ You are men to my mind !</l>
     <l n="354">Sit down , my dear creatures — I hope you 've not dined ! ” —</l>
     <l n="355">She talked of the king , and she talked of the queen ,</l>
     <l n="356">And she talked of her floors — that were not very clean :—</l>
     <l n="357">She talked of the parson , and spoke of the ‘ squire ,</l>
     <l n="358">She talked of her child that was singed in the fire —</l>
     <l n="359">The Tories , poor beings , were wishing to kiss her — oh —</l>
     <l n="360">If they had — all the stars would have fought against — Cicero . [ F ]</l>
     <l n="361">She talked , and she talked — now angry , now civil ,</l>
     <l n="362">‘ Till the Tories themselves wished her gone to the devil .</l>
     <l n="363">How I tremble to think of her tongue and her stick ,—</l>
     <l n="364">Tryphena , Tryphena ! I 've played the odd trick !</l>
     <l n="365">Now the soldier re-entered — the ladies were struck :</l>
     <l n="366">And “ she that can win him will have the best luck ! ”</l>
     <l n="367">“ La ! father ( said Kitty ) observe the bold man !</l>
     <l n="368">I will peep at his phyz from behind my new fan !</l>
     <l n="369">What a lace on his beaver !— his buttons all shine !</l>
     <l n="370">In the cock of a hat there is something divine !</l>
     <l n="371">Since the days of Goliah , I 'll venture to lay</l>

     <l n="374">If he 's not a hero , then call me Black Bess !</l>
     <l n="375">What a gaite — what a strut — how noble and free !</l>
     <l n="376">I 'm ravished !— I 'm ruined !— - good father !— good me ! ”</l>
     <l n="377">“ Dear Kitty , ( he answered ) regard not his lace ,</l>
     <l n="378">The devil I see in the mould of his face :</l>
     <l n="379">Cockades have been famous for crazing your sex</l>
     <l n="380">Since Helen played truant , and left the poor Greeks ;</l>
     <l n="381">And while her good husband was sleeping , and snored ,</l>
     <l n="382">Eloped with Sir Knight from his bed , and his board .—</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 59 ]</span>Freneau mentions in this poem that it was printed in New York in September , 1775 . I can find no trace of it , either as a separate publication or a contribution to a newspaper . As far as I can find , the poem is unique in the edition of 1809 .</p>
   <p>Mr. William Nelson of Paterson , N. J ., Secretary of the New Jersey Historical Society , believes that the local allusions in the poem cannot be verified . He writes :</p>
   <p>“ There were but two taverns at the Passaic Falls at that time ; one kept by Abraham Godwin , the other by James Leslie . Godwin and three of his sons went in the American Army at the beginning of the Revolution , and he died in the service . His widow survived him and carried on the tavern for a number of years . She had an intolerant hatred of all Tories . In 1776 Leslie was keeping a tavern at the present Passaic , a few miles below the Passaic Falls , and he continued there during the greater part of the Revolution , I think .</p>
   <p>“ The character of the tavern-keeper 's wife , ‘ Scalpella , ’ is either purely fictitious or based on the character of some other person . Moreover , I do not think Passaic Falls was ever a summer resort of the character depicted in this poem . Travellers merely went there to see the Falls , occasionally staying over night , but I cannot think it possible that there could have been such a party assembled there at one time as indicated in the poem . I do not think the two taverns together could have accommodated so many people . The place was never called ‘ Passaic Village , ’ as stated in the note , but was known as Totown Bridge until 1792 , when Paterson was founded . Passaic Village was the name given about forty years ago to the present city of Passaic .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The only allusions in the poem which have some semblance of reality are</l>
     <l n="2">the references to ‘ Miss Kitty , ’ by whom is perhaps meant the daughter of</l>
     <l n="3">Lord Stirling ; and ‘ Liberty Hall , ’ the residence of her uncle , Gov .</l>
     <l n="4">Livingstone , near Elizabethtown . There was no such person as ‘ Gubbins . ’</l>
     <l n="5">I should think that the scene of the poem , if it has any foundation</l>
     <l n="6">whatever in fact , was more probably laid somewhere near Philadelphia . ”</l>

   <p>THE FIRST POETIC PERIOD</p>
   <p>1775-1781 [ A ]</p>
   <p>[ A ] In August , 1775 , Freneau emerges from the obscurity which has concealed him since the year of his graduation at Princeton , and enters upon an era of marvelous productiveness . For four months , poetry must have been his one thought , his one occupation . It was during this period of his life that he did his most spontaneous and original work .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>This was published by Anderson in 1775 . In Holt 's New York Journal of July 6 , it is advertised as just published . The advertisement observes that “ This poem is humbly addressed to all true lovers of this once flourishing country , whether they shine as soldiers or statesmen . In it Ciceronian eloquence and patriotic fire are happily blended . ” The poet never reprinted it . The only copy of the poem extant , as far as I can discover , is that in the Library of Congress at Washington .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span>Of the siege of Havana , in July , 1762 , Bancroft writes : “ This siege was conducted in midsummer , against a city which lies just within the tropic . The country around the Moro Castle is rocky . To bind and carry the fascines was of itself a work of incredible labor ;... sufficient earth to hold the fascines firm was gathered with difficulty from the crevices of the rocks . Once , after a drought of fourteen days , the grand battery took fire from the flames , and crackling and spreading where water could not follow it , nor earth stifle it , was wholly consumed . The climate spoiled a great part of the provisions . Wanting good water , many died in agonies of thirst . More fell victims of a putrid fever .... Hundreds of carcasses floated on the ocean . And yet such was the enthusiasm of the English , such the resolute zeal of the sailors and soldiers , such the unity of action between the fleet and army , that the vertical sun of June and July , the heavy rains of August , raging fever , and strong and well defended fortresses , all the obstacles of nature and art were surmounted , and the most decisive victory of the war was gained . ”</p>

   <p>General Gage , the last royal governor of Massachusetts , arrived in Boston May , 1774 , and remained until October , 1775 , when he was succeeded by Major General Howe . The siege of Boston began with the arrival of Washington before the city , early in July , 1775 , and continued until Howe was forced to evacuate the city , the following March . Gage 's incompetency was admitted even by his own countrymen . He was narrow-minded , and prejudiced , and unable to estimate justly the forces that were against him . His only argument was force and dictatorial interference .</p>

     <l n="4">More wretched they whom heaven inspires to roam ,</l>
     <l n="5">Yet languish out their lives and die at home .</l>
     <l n="6">Heaven gave to man this wide extended round , 5</l>
     <l n="7">No climes confine him and no oceans bound ;</l>
     <l n="8">Heaven gave him forest , mountain , vale , and plain ,</l>
     <l n="9">And bade him vanquish , if he could , the main ;</l>
     <l n="10">But sordid cares our short-lived race confine ,</l>
     <l n="11">Some toil at trades , some labour in the mine , 10</l>
     <l n="12">The miser hoards , and guards his shining store ,</l>
     <l n="13">The sun still rises where he rose before —</l>
     <l n="14">No happier scenes his earth-born fancy fill</l>
     <l n="15">Than one dark valley , or one well-known hill .</l>
     <l n="16">To other shores his mind , untaught to stray , 15</l>
     <l n="17">Dull and inactive , slumbers life away .</l>
     <l n="18">But by the aid of yonder glimmering beam</l>

     <l n="28">What bolder bard to Boston shall repair ,</l>
     <l n="29">To view the peevish , half-starved spectres there ?</l>
     <l n="30">O thou wronged country ! why sustain these ills ?</l>
     <l n="31">Why rest thy navies on their native hills ? 30</l>

     <l n="33">Descend , ye forests , and command the main :</l>
     <l n="34">A leafy verdure shades the mighty mast ,</l>
     <l n="35">And the tall oak bends idly to the blast ,</l>
     <l n="36">Earth 's entrails teem with stores for your defence , 35</l>
     <l n="37">Descend and drag the stores of war from thence :</l>

     <l n="46">No — rather bid the wood 's wild native turn , 45</l>

     <l n="54">You dream of conquest — tell me how or whence —</l>
     <l n="55">Act like a man , and get you gone from hence ;</l>
     <l n="56">A madman sent you to this hostile shore 55</l>
     <l n="57">To vanquish nations , that shall spill your gore .—</l>
     <l n="58">Go , fiends , and in a social league combined</l>
     <l n="59">Destroy , distress , and triumph o'er mankind !—</l>
     <l n="60">Tis not our peace this murdering hand restrains ,</l>
     <l n="61">The want of power is made the monster 's chains ; 60</l>
     <l n="62">Compassion is a stranger to his heart ,</l>
     <l n="63">Or if it came , he bade the guest depart ;</l>
     <l n="64">The melting tear , the sympathising groan</l>
     <l n="65">Were never yet to Gage or Jefferies [ A ] known ;</l>
     <l n="66">The seas of blood his heart fore-dooms to spill 65</l>
     <l n="67">Is but a dying serpent 's rage to kill .</l>
     <l n="68">What power shall drive these vipers from our shore ,</l>
     <l n="69">These monsters swoln with carnage , death , and gore !</l>
     <l n="70">Twelve was the hour — congenial darkness reigned ,</l>
     <l n="71">And no bright star a mimic day-light feigned — 70</l>
     <l n="72">First , Gage we saw — a crimson chair of state</l>
     <l n="73">Received the honour of his Honour 's weight ;</l>
     <l n="74">This man of straw the regal purple bound ,</l>
     <l n="75">But dullness , deepest dullness , hovered round .</l>
     <l n="76">Next Graves , who wields the trident of the brine , 75</l>
     <l n="77">The tall arch-captain of the embattled line ,</l>
     <l n="78">All gloomy sate — mumbling of flame and fire ,</l>
     <l n="79">Balls , cannon , ships , and all their damned attire ;</l>
     <l n="80">Well pleased to live in never-ending hum ,</l>
     <l n="81">But empty as the interior of his drum . 80</l>
     <l n="82">Hard by , Burgoyne assumes an ample space ,</l>
     <l n="83">And seemed to meditate with studious face ,</l>
     <l n="84">As if again he wished our world to see</l>
     <l n="85">Long , dull , dry letters , writ to General Lee —</l>
     <l n="86">Huge scrawls of words through endless circuits drawn 85</l>
     <l n="87">Unmeaning as the errand he 's upon .—</l>
     <l n="88">Is he to conquer — he subdue our land ?—</l>
     <l n="89">This buckram hero , with his lady 's hand ?</l>

     <l n="93">This ill-timed snoring to the peer excuse ;</l>
     <l n="94">Tired was the long boy of his toilsome day ,</l>
     <l n="95">Full fifteen miles he fled — a tedious way ;</l>
     <l n="96">How could he then the dews of Somnus shun , 95</l>
     <l n="97">Perhaps not used to walk — much less to run .</l>
     <l n="98">Red-faced as suns , when sinking to repose ,</l>
     <l n="99">Reclined the infernal captain of the Rose , [ B ]</l>

     <l n="104">Pleased with base vengeance on defenceless towns ,</l>
     <l n="105">His heart was malice — but his words were , Zounds !</l>
     <l n="106">Howe , vexed to see his starving army 's doom , 105</l>
     <l n="107">In prayer , besought the skies for elbow room —<span type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span></l>
     <l n="108">Small was his stock , and theirs , of heavenly grace ,</l>
     <l n="109">Yet just enough to ask a larger place .—</l>
     <l n="110">He cursed the brainless minister that planned</l>
     <l n="111">His bootless errand to this hostile land , 110</l>
     <l n="112">But , awed by Gage , his bursting wrath recoiled ,</l>
     <l n="113">And in his inmost bosom doubly boiled .</l>
     <l n="114">These , chief of all the tyrant-serving train ,</l>
     <l n="115">Exalted sate — the rest ( a pensioned clan ) ,</l>
     <l n="116">A sample of the multitude that wait , 115</l>
     <l n="117">Pale sons of famine , at perdition 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="118">North 's friends down swarming ( so our monarch wills ) ,</l>
     <l n="119">Hungry as death , from Caledonian hills ;</l>
     <l n="120">Whose endless numbers if you bid me tell ,</l>
     <l n="121">I 'll count the atoms of this globe as well ,— 120</l>
     <l n="122">Knights , captains , ‘ squires — a wonder-working band ,</l>
     <l n="123">Held at small wages ‘ till they gain the land ,</l>
     <l n="124">Flocked pensive round — black spleen assailed their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="125">( The sport of plough-boys , with their arms and arts )</l>
     <l n="126">And made them doubt ( howe'er for vengeance hot ) 125</l>
     <l n="127">Whether they were invincible or not .</l>
     <l n="128">Now Gage upstarting from his cushioned seat</l>
     <l n="129">Swore thrice , and cried — “ ‘ Tis nonsense to be beat !</l>

     <l n="148">Thus spoke the great man in disdainful tone</l>

    <head>A VOYAGE TO BOSTON , A POEM</head>
    <head>ARGUMENT</head>
    <head>Introductory reflections . A traveller undertakes a voyage to Boston : arrives in a river of Massachusetts : has there a sight of the native Genius of North-America , who presents him with a mantle , and acquaints him with its virtue of rendering the wearer invisible ; desires him to visit the town in that state and remark the transactions there . Accordingly he arrives at General Gage 's mansion , where are several other ministerial tools sitting in council . The striking similarity of Gage 's temper and conduct to that of Hernando Cortez . Some account of Cortez , and his horrid devastations in Mexico , &amp; c. The traveller enters their junto , and gives an account of the chief members of it , viz ., General Gage , Admiral Greaves , General Burgoyne , Lord Percy , General Howe , Capt . Wallace , and a numerous fry of dependents and needy favourites waiting for posts and estates in America , as soon as they shall have compelled us to resign our liberties : General Gage 's surprize at their several defeats in New-England , and questions his leaders thereupon . Lord Percy 's answer : Greaves 's reply to that nobleman : Gage 's raillery upon Percy for his nimble retreat on April 19 , 1775 . Percy 's defence of his conduct on that day , and the reason of his activity ; and desires them to forget Lexington for the present , and turn their eyes to the late loss at Bunker 's Hill . General Howe 's speech concerning that action . Burgoyne 's harrangue , with his invectives against Colonel Grant , who “ pledged himself for the general cowardice of all America : ” Gage 's brief reply ; and communicates his intention of purloining cattle from the islands , and plans that right honourable exploit ; but being overcome by sleep , dismisses his counsellors . The cutting down the Liberty Tree in Boston , and untimely end of one of the wretches employed in that sneaking affair . Distresses of the imprisoned citizens in Boston . Dissection of a Tory . The traveller leaves Boston , and visits the Provincial Camp ; meets the Genius of America again on the way and resigns the mantle , whereby he again becomes visible ; arrives at the camp . View of the Rifle-men , Virginians , &amp; c. Speech of an American soldier ; his determined resolution , which is that of all America , to defend our rights and privileges . Grief that he must fight against our own nation . Mention of Carleton and Johnson ; concludes with a melancholy recital of our present distractions , and sincere hope of reconcilation with Great Britain before a wicked ministry render it too late . Conclusion .</head>

     <l n="1">How curs 'd the man whom fate 's unhappy doom</l>

     <l n="3">How doubly curs 'd by cross grain 'd stars is he ,</l>
     <l n="4">Whom fate ties down , tho ’ struggling to be free !</l>
     <l n="5">Heaven gave to man this vast extended round .</l>
     <l n="6">No climes confine him and no oceans bound ;</l>

     <l n="29">Long are her nights , that yield no chearful sound ,</l>
     <l n="30">Like endless nights in tombs below the ground ,</l>
     <l n="31">Low burns her lamp before th ’ insulting rout ;</l>
     <l n="32">See , the lamp dies , and every light goes out !</l>
     <l n="33">O Britain come , and , if you can , relent</l>
     <l n="34">This rage , that better might on Spain be spent .</l>
     <l n="35">Touch 'd with the mountain 's melancholy prayer</l>

Washington of Aug. 13 . ” It was published in the 1786 edition with the title , “ On the Conqueror of America shut up in Boston . Published in New York , August 1775 . ” The 1795 edition changed the title to “ The Misnomer . ” I have followed the title and text of the 1809 edition .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span>General Gage 's proclamation , issued June 12 , 1775 , was as follows : “ Whereas the infatuated multitudes , who have long suffered themselves to be conducted by certain well-known incendiaries and traitors , in a fatal progression of crimes against the constitutional authority of the state , have at length proceeded to avowed rebellion , and the good effects which were expected to arise from the patience and lenity of the king 's government have been often frustrated , and are now rendered hopeless by the influence of the same evil counsels , it only remains for those who are intrusted with the supreme rule , as well for the punishment of the guilty as the protection of the well-affected , to prove that they do not bear the sword in vain . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span>“ The hopeful general . ” — Constitutional Gazette .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span>On June 11 , Washington had written Gage , among other things , “ that the officers engaged in the cause of liberty and their country , who by the fortune of war had fallen into your hands , have been thrown indiscriminately into a common gaol appropriated for felons , ” and threatening retaliation in like cases , “ exactly by the rule you shall observe towards those of ours now in your custody . ” To this Cage replied , on the 13th : “ Britons , ever pre-eminent in mercy , have outgone common examples , and overlooked the criminal in the captive . Upon these principles your prisoners , whose lives , by the law of the land , are destined to the cord , have hitherto been treated with care and kindness , ” &amp; c .— Duyckinck .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 116 ]</span>On July 28 , 1775 , George III . wrote to Lord North : “ I have desired Lord Dartmouth to acquaint Lt. G. Gage that as he thinks nothing further can be done this campaign in the province of Massachusetts Bay that he is desired instantly to come over , that he may explain the various wants for carrying on the next campaign . ” “ It was a kindly pretext devised to spare the feelings of an unprofitable but a faithful and a brave servant . ” — Trevelyan . General Gage embarked at Boston for England , Oct. 12 , 1775 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 117 ]</span>The scarcity of provisions in the British camp during the siege of Boston has been already alluded to . “ When marauding expeditions , ” says Bancroft , “ returned with sheep and hogs and cattle captured from islands , the bells were rung as for victory . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 118 ]</span>Alluding to the proclamation of June 12 , five days before Bunker Hill , which established martial law throughout Massachusetts and proscribed Hancock and Samuel Adams . By this proclamation , all who were in arms about Boston , every member of the State Government and of the Continental Congress , were threatened with condign punishment as rebels and traitors .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 119 ]</span>Washington had written to Gage , remonstrating against the cruel treatment of certain American officers , who were denied the privileges and immunities due their rank . Almost the last official act of Gage was to reply through Burgoyne in a letter addressed to “ George Washington , Esqr ., ” that “ Britons , ever pre-eminent in mercy , have overlooked the criminal in the captive . Your prisoners , whose lives by the law of the land are destined to the cord , have hitherto been treated with care and kindness ;— indiscriminately , it is true , for I acknowledge no rank that is not derived from the King . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 121 ]</span>This poem seems first to have appeared in the edition of 1786 , where it bore the title , “ Female Frailty . Written November 1775 . ” Freneau made use of the opening speeches of Damon and Lucinda in his drama , The Spy . He omitted the poem from the 1795 edition of his works , retaining , however , the opening lyric , which he entitled “ The Northern Soldier . ” The poem was reprinted in the edition of 1809 , the text of which I have used . The poet edited the earlier version with great care , making verbal variations in almost every line , and adding lines and even stanzas . I have marked only a few of the more notable changes .</p>

     <l n="151">And leave Mac Swiggen to enjoy the field —</l>
     <l n="152">In distant isles some happier scene I 'll choose ,</l>
     <l n="153">And court in softer shades the unwilling Muse ,</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 144 ]</span>I can find only two versions of this poem : that in the 1786 edition of the poet , which I have reproduced , and that in the 1809 edition , in which the title is changed to “ A Satire in Answer to a Hostile Attack . [ First written , and published 1775 . ] ” From the nature of the concluding lines of the poem , it may be inferred that it was the last work done by the poet before starting on his voyage to the West Indies , late In November . I have not been able to find a trace of the hostile attack in the newspapers or publications of the period , or of the original publication of “ Mac Swiggen . ” The poem was omitted from the 1795 edition , only the first eight lines being used in the short poem “ To Shylock Ap-Shenken . ” The poet made many verbal changes for the later edition , but I have marked only the most significant .</p>

     <l n="1">A Vision</l>
   </lg>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT — This Poem is founded upon the authority of Scripture , inasmuch as these sacred books assert , that the last enemy that shall be conquered is Death . For the purposes of poetry he is here personified , and represented as on his dying bed . The scene is laid at a solitary palace , ( the time midnight ) which , tho ’ before beautiful and joyous , is now become sad and gloomy , as being the abode and receptacle of Death . Its owner , an amiable , majestic youth , who had lately lost a beloved consort , nevertheless with a noble philosophical fortitude and humanity , entertains him in a friendly manner , and by employing Physicians , endeavours to restore him to health , altho ’ an enemy ; convinced of the excellence and propriety of that divine precept , If thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink . He nevertheless , as if by a spirit of prophecy , informs this ( fictitiously ) wicked being of the certainty of his doom , and represents to him in a pathetic manner the vanity of his expectations , either of a reception into the abodes of the just , or continuing longer to make havock of mankind upon earth . The patient finding his end approaching , composes his epitaph , and orders it to be engraved on his tombstone , hinting to us thereby , that even Death and Distress have vanity ; and would be remembered with honour after he is no more , altho ’ his whole life has been spent in deeds of devastation and murder . He dies at last in the utmost agonies of despair , after agreeing with an avaricious Undertaker to intomb his bones . This reflects upon the inhumanity of those men , who , not to mention an enemy , would scarcely cover a departed friend with a little dust , without certainty of reward for so doing . The circumstances of his funeral are then recited , and the visionary and fabulous part of the poem disappears . It concludes with a few reflections on the impropriety of a too great attachment to the present life , and incentives to such moral virtue as may assist in conducting us to a better .</p>

   <note>note . 10 Rude , from the wide extended Chesapeke I heard the winds the dashing waves assail , And saw from far , by picturing fancy form 'd , The black ship travelling through the noisy gale . 40 11 At last , by chance and guardian fancy led , I reach 'd a noble dome , rais 'd fair and high , And saw the light from upper windows flame , Presage of mirth and hospitality . 12 And by that light around the dome appear 'd 45 A mournful garden of autumnal hue , Its lately pleasing flowers all drooping stood Amidst high weeds that in rank plenty grew . 13 The Primrose there , the violet darkly blue , Daisies and fair Narcissus ceas 'd to rise , 50 Gay spotted pinks their charming bloom withdrew , And Polyanthus quench 'd its thousand dyes . 14 No pleasant fruit or blossom gaily smil 'd , Nought but unhappy plants or trees were seen , The yew , the myrtle , and the church-yard elm , 55 The cypress , with its melancholy green . 15 There cedars dark , the osier , and the pine , Shorn tamarisks , and weeping willows grew , The poplar tall , the lotos , and the lime , And pyracantha did her leaves renew . 60 16 The poppy there , companion to repose , Display 'd her blossoms that began to fall , And here the purple amaranthus rose With mint strong-scented , for the funeral . 17 And here and there with laurel shrubs between 65 A tombstone lay , inscrib 'd with strains of woe , And stanzas sad , throughout the dismal green , Lamented for the dead that slept below . 18 Peace to this awful dome !— when strait I heard The voice of men in a secluded room , 70 Much did they talk of death , and much of life , Of coffins , shrouds , and horrors of a tomb . 19 Pathetic were their words , and well they aim 'd To explain the mystic paths of providence , Learn 'd were they all , but there remain 'd not I 75 To hear the upshot of their conference . 20 Meantime from an adjoining chamber came Confused murmurings , half distinguish 'd sounds , And as I nearer drew , disputes arose Of surgery , and remedies for wounds . 80 21 Dull were their feuds , for they went on to talk Of Anchylosis , [ B ] and the shoulder blade , Os Femoris , [ B ] Trochanters [ B ] — and whate'er Has been discuss 'd by Cheselden or Meade : [ B ] Anchylosis — a morbid contraction of the joints . Os Femoris — the thigh bone . Trochanters — two processes in the upper part of the thigh bone , otherwise called rotator major et minor , in which the tendons of many muscles terminate .— Freneau 's notes . 22 And often each , to prove his notion true , 85 Brought proofs from Galen or Hippocrates — But fancy led me hence — and left them so , Firm at their points of hardy No and Yes . 23 Then up three winding stairs my feet were brought To a high chamber , hung with mourning sad , 90 The unsnuff 'd candles glar 'd with visage dim , ‘ Midst grief , in ecstacy of woe run mad . 24 A wide leaf 'd table stood on either side , Well fraught with phials , half their liquids spent , And from a couch , behind the curtain 's veil , 95 I heard a hollow voice of loud lament . 25 Turning to view the object whence it came , My frighted eyes a horrid form survey 'd ; Fancy , I own thy power — Death on the couch , With fleshless limbs , at rueful length , was laid . 100 26 And o'er his head flew jealousies and cares , Ghosts , imps , and half the black Tartarian crew , Arch-angels damn 'd , nor was their Prince remote , Borne on the vaporous wings of Stygian dew . 27 Around his bed , by the dull flambeaux ’ glare , 105 I saw pale phantoms — Rage to madness vext , Wan , wasting grief , and ever musing care , Distressful pain , and poverty perplext . 28 Sad was his countenance , if we can call That countenance , where only bones were seen 110 And eyes sunk in their sockets , dark and low , And teeth , that only show 'd themselves to grin . 29 Reft was his scull of hair , and no fresh bloom Of chearful mirth sate on his visage hoar : Sometimes he rais 'd his head , while deep-drawn groans 115 Were mixt with words that did his fate deplore . 30 Oft did he wish to see the daylight spring , And often toward the window lean 'd to hear , Fore-runner of the scarlet-mantled morn , The early note of wakeful Chanticleer . 120 31 Thus he — But at my hand a portly youth Of comely countenance , began to tell , “ That this was Death upon his dying bed , “ Sullen , morose , and peevish to be well ; 32 “ Fixt is his doom — the miscreant reigns no more 125 “ The tyrant of the dying or the dead ; “ This night concludes his all-consuming reign , “ Pour out , ye heav'ns , your vengeance on his head . 33 “ But since , my friend ( said he ) , chance leads you here , “ With me this night upon the sick attend , 130 “ You on this bed of death must watch , and I “ Will not be distant from the fretful fiend . 34 “ Before he made this lofty pile his home , “ In undisturb 'd repose I sweetly slept , “ But when he came to this sequester 'd dome , 135 “ ‘ Twas then my troubles came , and then I wept : 35 “ Twice three long nights , in this sad chamber , I , “ As though a brother languish 'd in despair , “ Have ‘ tended faithful round his gloomy bed , “ Have been content to breathe this loathsome air . 140 36 “ A while relieve the languors that I feel , “ Sleep 's magic forces close my weary eyes ; “ Soft o'er my soul unwonted slumbers steal , “ Aid the weak patient till you see me rise . 37 “ But let no slumbers on your eye-lids fall , 145 “ That if he ask for powder or for pill “ You may be ready at the word to start , “ And still seem anxious to perform his will . 38 “ The bleeding Saviour of a world undone “ Bade thy compassion rise toward thy foe ; 150 “ Then , stranger , for the sake of Mary 's son , “ Thy tears of pity on this wretch bestow . 39 “ ‘ Twas he that stole from my adoring arms “ Aspasia , she the loveliest of her kind , “ Lucretia 's virtue , with a Helen 's charms , 155 “ Charms of the face , and beauties of the mind . 40 “ The blushy cheek , the lively , beaming eye , “ The ruby lip , the flowing jetty hair , “ The stature tall , the aspect so divine , “ All beauty , you would think , had center 'd there . 160 41 “ Each future age her virtues shall extol , “ Nor the just tribute to her worth refuse ; “ Fam 'd , to the stars Urania bids her rise , “ Theme of the moral , and the tragic Muse . 42 “ Sweet as the fragrance of the vernal morn , 165 “ Nipt in its bloom this faded flower I see ; “ The inspiring angel from that breast is gone , “ And life 's warm tide forever chill 'd in thee ! 43 “ Such charms shall greet my longing soul no more , “ Her lively eyes are clos 'd in endless shade , 170 “ Torpid , she rests on yonder marble floor ; “ Approach , and see what havock Death has made . 44 “ Yet , stranger , hold — her charms are so divine , “ Such tints of life still on her visage glow , “ That even in death this slumbering bride of mine 175 “ May seize thy heart , and make thee wretched too . 45 “ O shun the sight — forbid thy trembling hand “ From her pale face to raise the enshrouding lawn ,— “ Death claims thy care , obey his stern command , “ Trim the dull tapers , for I see no dawn ! ” 180 46 So said , at Death 's left side I sate me down , The mourning youth toward his right reclin 'd ; Death in the middle lay , with all his groans , And much he toss 'd and tumbled , sigh 'd and pin 'd . 47 But now this man of hell toward me turn 'd , 185 And strait , in hideous tone , began to speak ; Long held he sage discourse , but I forebore To answer him , much less his news to seek . 48 He talk 'd of tomb-stones and of monuments , Of Equinoctial climes and India shores , 190 He talk 'd of stars that shed their influence , Fevers and plagues , and all their noxious stores . 49 He mention 'd , too , the guileful calenture , [ C ] Tempting the sailor on the deep sea main , That paints gay groves upon the ocean floor , 195 Beckoning her victim to the faithless scene . [ C ] Calenture — an inflammatory fever , attended with a delirium , common in long voyages at sea , in which the diseased persons fancy the sea to be green fields and meadows , and , if they are not hindered , will leap overboard .— Freneau 's note . 50 Much spoke he of the myrtle and the yew , Of ghosts that nightly walk the church-yard o'er , Of storms that through the wint'ry ocean blow And dash the well-mann 'd galley on the shore , 200 51 Of broad-mouth 'd cannons , and the thunderbolt , Of sieges and convulsions , dearth and fire , Of poisonous weeds — but seem 'd to sneer at these Who by the laurel o'er him did aspire . 52 Then with a hollow voice thus went he on : 205 “ Get up , and search , and bring , when found , to me , “ Some cordial , potion , or some pleasant draught , “ Sweet , slumb'rous poppy , or the mild Bohea . 53 “ But hark , my pitying friend !— and , if you can , “ Deceive the grim physician at the door — 210 “ Bring half the mountain springs — ah ! hither bring “ The cold rock water from the shady bower . 54 “ For till this night such thirst did ne'er invade , “ A thirst provok 'd by heav'n ' s avenging hand ; “ Hence bear me , friends , to quaff , and quaff again 215 “ The cool wave bubbling from the yellow sand . 55 “ To these dark walls with stately step I came , “ Prepar 'd your drugs and doses to defy ; “ Smit with the love of never dying fame , “ I came , alas ! to conquer — not to die ! ” 220 56 Glad , from his side I sprang , and fetch 'd the draught , Which down his greedy throat he quickly swills , Then on a second errand sent me strait , To search in some dark corner for his pills . 57 Quoth he , “ These pills have long compounded been , 225 “ Of dead men 's bones and bitter roots , I trow ; “ But that I may to wonted health return , “ Throughout my lank veins shall their substance go . ” 58 So down they went .— He rais 'd his fainting head And oft in feeble tone essay 'd to talk ; 230 Quoth he , “ Since remedies have small avail , “ Assist unhappy Death once more to walk . ” 59 Then slowly rising from his loathsome bed , On wasted legs the meagre monster stood , Gap 'd wide , and foam 'd , and hungry seem 'd to ask , 235 Tho ’ sick , an endless quantity of food . 60 Said he , “ The sweet melodious flute prepare , “ The anthem , and the organ 's solemn sound , “ Such as may strike my soul with ecstacy , “ Such as may from yon ’ lofty wall rebound . 240 61 “ Sweet music can the fiercest pains assuage , “ She bids the soul to heaven 's blest mansions rise , “ She calms despair , controuls infernal rage “ And deepest anguish , when it hears her , dies . 62 “ And see , the mizzling , misty midnight reigns , 245 “ And no soft dews are on my eye-lids sent !— “ Here , stranger , lend thy hand ; assist me , pray , “ To walk a circuit of no large extent . ” — 63 On my prest shoulders leaning , round he went , And could have made the boldest spectre flee , 250 I led him up stairs , and I led him down , But not one moment 's rest from pain got he . 64 Then with his dart , its cusp unpointed now , Thrice with main strength he smote the trembling floor ; The roof resounded to the fearful blow , 255 And Cleon started , doom 'd to sleep no more . 65 When thus spoke Death , impatient of controul , “ Quick , move , and bring from yonder black bureau “ The sacred book that may preserve my soul “ From long damnation , and eternal woe . 260 66 “ And with it bring — for you may find them there , “ The works of holy authors , dead and gone , “ The sacred tome of moving Drelincourt , “ Or what more solemn Sherlock mus 'd upon : 67 “ And read , my Cleon , what these sages say , 265 “ And what the sacred Penman hath declar 'd , “ That when the wicked leaves his odious way , “ His sins shall vanish , and his soul be spar 'd . ” 68 But he , unmindful of the vain command , Reason 'd with Death , nor were his reasonings few : 270 Quoth he — “ My Lord , what frenzy moves your brain , “ Pray , what , my Lord , can Sherlock be to you , 69 “ Or all the sage divines that ever wrote , “ Grave Drelincourt , or heaven 's unerring page ; “ These point their arrows at your hostile breast , 275 “ And raise new pains that time must ne'er assuage . 70 “ And why should thus thy woe disturb my rest ? “ Much of Theology I once did read , “ And there ‘ tis fixt , sure as my God is so , “ That Death shall perish , tho ’ a God should bleed . 280 71 “ The martyr , doom 'd the pangs of fire to feel , “ Lives but a moment in the sultry blast ; “ The victim groans , and dies beneath the steel , “ But thy severer pains shall always last . 72 “ O miscreant vile , thy age has made thee doat — 285 “ If peace , if sacred peace were found for you , “ Hell would cry out , and all the damn 'd arise “ And , more deserving , seek for pity too . 73 “ Seek not for Paradise — ‘ tis not for thee , “ Where high in heaven its sweetest blossoms blow , 290 “ Nor even where , gliding to the Persian main , “ Thy waves , Euphrates , through the garden flow ! 74 “ Bloody has been thy reign , O man of hell , “ Who sympathiz 'd with no departing groan ; “ Cruel wast thou , and hardly dost deserve 295 “ To have Hic Jacet stampt upon thy stone . 75 “ He that could build his mansion o'er the tombs , “ Depending still on sickness and decay , “ May dwell unmov 'd amidst these drowsier glooms , “ May laugh the dullest of these shades away . 300 76 “ Remember how with unrelenting ire “ You tore the infant from the unwilling breast — “ Aspasia fell , and Cleon must expire , “ Doom 'd by the impartial God to endless rest : 77 “ In vain with stars he deck 'd yon ’ spangled skies , 305 “ And bade the mind to heaven 's bright regions soar , “ And brought so far to my admiring eyes “ A glimpse of glories that shall blaze no more ! 78 “ Even now , to glut thy devilish wrath , I see “ From eastern realms a wasteful army rise : 310 “ Why else those lights that tremble in the north ? “ Why else yon ’ comet blazing through the skies ? 79 “ Rejoice , O fiend ; Britannia 's tyrant sends “ From German plains his myriads to our shore . “ The fierce Hibernian with the Briton join 'd — 315 “ Bring them , ye winds !— but waft them back no more . 80 “ To you , alas ! the fates in wrath deny “ The comforts to our parting moments due , “ And leave you here to languish and to die , “ Your crimes too many , and your tears too few . 320 81 “ No cheering voice to thee shall cry , Repent ! “ As once it echoed through the wilderness — “ No patron died for thee — damn 'd , damn 'd art thou “ Like all the devils , nor one jot the less . 82 “ A gloomy land , with sullen skies is thine , 325 “ Where never rose or amaranthus grow , “ No daffodils , nor comely columbine , “ No hyacinths nor asphodels for you . 83 “ The barren trees that flourish on the shore “ With leaves or fruit were never seen to bend , 330 “ O'er languid waves unblossom 'd branches hang , “ And every branch sustains some vagrant fiend . 84 “ And now no more remains , but to prepare “ To take possession of thy punishment ; “ That 's thy inheritance , that thy domain , 335 “ A land of bitter woe , and loud lament . 85 “ And oh that He , who spread the universe , “ Would cast one pitying glance on thee below ! “ Millions of years in torments thou might'st fry , “ But thy eternity !— who can conceive its woe ! ” 340 86 He heard , and round with his black eye-balls gaz 'd , Full of despair , and curs 'd , and rav 'd , and swore : “ And since this is my doom , ” said he , “ call up “ Your wood-mechanics to my chamber door : 87 “ Blame not on me the ravage to be made ; 345 “ Proclaim ,— even Death abhors such woe to see ; “ I 'll quit the world , while decently I can , “ And leave the work to George my deputy . ” 88 Up rush 'd a band , with compasses and scales To measure his slim carcase , long and lean — 350 “ Be sure , ” said he , “ to frame my coffin strong , “ You , master workman , and your men , I mean : 89 “ For if the Devil , so late my trusty friend , “ Should get one hint where I am laid , from you , “ Not with my soul content , he 'd seek to find 355 “ That mouldering mass of bones , my body , too ! 90 “ Of hardest ebon let the plank be found , “ With clamps and ponderous bars secur 'd around , “ That if the box by Satan should be storm 'd , “ It may be able for resistance found . ” 360 91 “ Yes , ” said the master workman , “ noble Death , “ Your coffin shall be strong — that leave to me — “ But who shall these your funeral dues discharge ? “ Nor friends nor pence you have , that I can see . ” 92 To this said Death — “ You might have ask 'd me , too , 365 “ Base caitiff , who are my executors , “ Where my estate , and who the men that shall “ Partake my substance , and be call 'd my heirs . 93 “ Know , then , that hell is my inheritance , “ The devil himself my funeral dues must pay — 370 “ Go — since you must be paid — go , ask of him , “ For he has gold , as fabling poets say . ” 94 Strait they retir 'd — when thus he gave me charge , Pointing from the light window to the west , “ Go three miles o'er the plain , and you shall see 375 “ A burying-yard of sinners dead , unblest . 95 “ Amid the graves a spiry building stands “ Whose solemn knell resounding through the gloom “ Shall call thee o'er the circumjacent lands “ To the dull mansion destin 'd for my tomb . 380 96 “ There , since ‘ tis dark , I 'll plant a glimmering light “ Just snatch 'd from hell , by whose reflected beams “ Thou shalt behold a tomb-stone , full eight feet , “ Fast by a grave , replete with ghosts and dreams . 97 “ And on that stone engrave this epitaph , 385 “ Since Death , it seems , must die like mortal men ; “ Yes — on that stone engrave this epitaph , “ Though all hell 's furies aim to snatch the pen . 98 “ Death in this tomb his weary bones hath laid , “ Sick of dominion o'er the human kind — 390 “ Behold what devastations he hath made , “ Survey the millions by his arm confin 'd . 99 “ Six thousand years has sovereign sway been mine , “ None , but myself , can real glory claim ; “ Great Regent of the world I reign 'd alone , 395 “ And princes trembled when my mandate came . 100 “ Vast and unmatch 'd throughout the world , my fame “ Takes place of gods , and asks no mortal date — “ No ; by myself , and by the heavens , I swear , “ Not Alexander 's name is half so great . 400 101 “ Nor swords nor darts my prowess could withstand , “ All quit their arms , and bowd to my decree , “ Even mighty Julius died beneath my hand , “ For slaves and Caesars were the same to me ! 102 “ Traveller , wouldst thou his noblest trophies seek , 405 “ Search in no narrow spot obscure for those ; “ The sea profound , the surface of all land “ Is moulded with the myriads of his foes . ” 103 Scarce had he spoke , when on the lofty dome Rush 'd from the clouds a hoarse resounding blast — 410 Round the four eaves so loud and sad it play 'd As though all musick were to breathe its last . 104 Warm was the gale , and such as travellers say Sport with the winds on Zaara 's barren waste ; Black was the sky , a mourning carpet spread , 415 Its azure blotted , and its stars o'ercast ! 105 Lights in the air like burning stars were hurl 'd , Dogs howl 'd , heaven mutter 'd , and the tempest blew , The red half-moon peeped from behind a cloud As if in dread the amazing scene to view . 420 106 The mournful trees that in the garden stood Bent to the tempest as it rush 'd along , The elm , the myrtle , and the cypress sad More melancholy tun 'd its bellowing song . 107 No more that elm its noble branches spread , 425 The yew , the cypress , or the myrtle tree , Rent from the roots the tempest tore them down , And all the grove in wild confusion lay . 108 Yet , mindful of his dread command , I part Glad from the magic dome — nor found relief ; 430 Damps from the dead hung heavier round my heart , While sad remembrance rous 'd her stores of grief . 109 O'er a dark field I held my dubious way Where Jack-a-lanthorn walk 'd his lonely round , Beneath my feet substantial darkness lay , 435 And screams were heard from the distemper 'd ground . 110 Nor look 'd I back , till to a far off wood , Trembling with fear , my weary feet had sped — Dark was the night , but at the inchanted dome I saw the infernal windows flaming red . 440 111 And from within the howls of Death I heard , Cursing the dismal night that gave him birth , Damning his ancient sire , and mother sin , Who at the gates of hell , accursed , brought him forth . 112 [ For fancy gave to my enraptur 'd soul 445 An eagle 's eye , with keenest glance to see , And bade those distant sounds distinctly roll , Which , waking , never had affected me . ] 113 Oft his pale breast with cruel hand he smote , And tearing from his limbs a winding sheet , 450 Roar 'd to the black skies , while the woods around , As wicked as himself , his words repeat . 114 Thrice tow'rd the skies his meagre arms he rear 'd , Invok 'd all hell , and thunders on his head , Bid light'nings fly , earth yawn , and tempests roar , 455 And the sea wrap him in its oozy bed . 115 “ My life for one cool draught !— O , fetch your springs , “ Can one unfeeling to my woes be found ! “ No friendly visage comes to my relief , “ But ghosts impend , and spectres hover round . 460 116 “ Though humbled now , dishearten 'd and distrest , “ Yet , when admitted to the peaceful ground , “ With heroes , kings , and conquerors I shall rest , “ Shall sleep as safely , and perhaps as sound . ” 117 Dim burnt the lamp , and now the phantom Death 465 Gave his last groans in horror and despair — “ All hell demands me hence , ” — he said , and threw The red lamp hissing through the midnight air . 118 Trembling , across the plain my course I held , And found the grave-yard , loitering through the gloom , 470 And , in the midst , a hell-red , wandering light , Walking in fiery circles round the tomb . 119 Among the graves a spiry building stood , Whose tolling bell , resounding through the shade , Sung doleful ditties to the adjacent wood , 475 And many a dismal drowsy thing it said . 120 This fabrick tall , with towers and chancels grac 'd , Was rais 'd by sinners ’ hands , in ages fled ; The roof they painted , and the beams they brac 'd , And texts from scripture o'er the walls they spread : 480 121 But wicked were their hearts , for they refus 'd To aid the helpless orphan , when distrest , The shivering , naked stranger they mis-us 'd , And banish 'd from their doors the starving guest . 122 By laws protected , cruel and prophane , 485 The poor man 's ox these monsters drove away ;— And left Distress to attend her infant train , No friend to comfort , and no bread to stay . 123 But heaven look 'd on with keen , resentful eye , And doom 'd them to perdition and the grave , 490 That as they felt not for the wretch distrest , So heaven no pity on their souls would have . 124 In pride they rais 'd this building tall and fair , Their hearts were on perpetual mischief bent , With pride they preach 'd , and pride was in their prayer , 495 With pride they were deceiv 'd , and so to hell they went . 125 At distance far approaching to the tomb , By lamps and lanthorns guided through the shade , A coal-black chariot hurried through the gloom , Spectres attending , in black weeds array 'd , 500 126 Whose woeful forms yet chill my soul with dread , Each wore a vest in Stygian chambers wove , Death 's kindred all — Death 's horses they bestrode , And gallop 'd fiercely , as the chariot drove . 127 Each horrid face a grizly mask conceal 'd , 505 Their busy eyes shot terror to my soul As now and then , by the pale lanthorn 's glare , I saw them for their parted friend condole . 128 Before the hearse Death 's chaplain seem 'd to go , Who strove to comfort , what he could , the dead ; 510 Talk 'd much of Satan , and the land of woe , And many a chapter from the scriptures read . 129 At last he rais 'd the swelling anthem high , In dismal numbers seem 'd he to complain ; The captive tribes that by Euphrates wept , 515 Their song was jovial to his dreary strain . 130 That done , they plac 'd the carcase in the tomb , To dust and dull oblivion now resign 'd , Then turn 'd the chariot tow'rd the House of Night , Which soon flew off , and left no trace behind . 520 131 But as I stoop 'd to write the appointed verse , Swifter than thought the airy scene decay 'd ; Blushing the morn arose , and from the east With her gay streams of light dispell 'd the shade . 132 What is this Death , ye deep read sophists , say ?— 525 Death is no more than one unceasing change ; New forms arise , while other forms decay , Yet all is Life throughout creation 's range . 133 The towering Alps , the haughty Appenine , The Andes , wrapt in everlasting snow , 530 The Apalachian and the Ararat Sooner or later must to ruin go . 134 Hills sink to plains , and man returns to dust , That dust supports a reptile or a flower ; Each changeful atom by some other nurs 'd 535 Takes some new form , to perish in an hour . 135 Too nearly join 'd to sickness , toils , and pains , ( Perhaps for former crimes imprison 'd here ) True to itself the immortal soul remains , And seeks new mansions in the starry sphere . 540 136 When Nature bids thee from the world retire , With joy thy lodging leave , a fated guest ; In Paradise , the land of thy desire , Existing always , always to be blest .<span type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span>The text is from the edition of 1786 , which contains the only complete version . The poem was first published in the August number of The United States Magazine , 1779 , which also contained the following note : “ ‘ The House of Night ’ , a poem in the present number of the Magazine , is from a young gentleman who has favoured us with several original pieces in the course of this work ; and readers of taste will no doubt be pleased with it , as perfectly original both in the design and manner of it . ” It bore the title “ The House of Night ; or , Six Hours Lodging with Death , A Vision , ” and the quotation : “ Felix qui potiut rerum cognoscere causas , Atque metus omnes et inexorable Fatum Subjecit pedibus , strepitumque Acherontis avari . VIRG . GEORG . II ., v. 490 . ” As printed in the magazine it consisted of seventy-three stanzas , which coincide with the following numbers of the 1786 edition : 3 , 4 , 6-10 , 12 , 14 , 18 , 20-26 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 47-54 , 58 , 59 , 65 , 66 , 68 , 69 , 72 , 74 , 75 , 78 , 79 , 86 , 87 , 94 , 96-100 , 102-106 , 111 , 113-115 , 117 , 118 , 125-127 , 130 , 131 .

Seek me no more along that mountain stream , For on his banks is heard the sound of woe . Sword , famine , thirst , and pining sickness there , Shall people half the realms this monster owns ; He like the cruel foe , accursed he , Laughs at our pains , rejoices in our groans . Now wilt you tremble if you hear your fate , Out of the dread Apocalypse your doom , That death and hell must perish in the lake Of fire , dispelling half hell 's ancient gloom . ” 341 , “ black optics ” ; 348 , “ And leave the business to some deputy ” ; 373 , “ Now thus the drooping victim gave me charge ” ; 381 , “ A quivering light ” ; 383 , “ by whose far glimmering beams ” ; 384 , “ arrayed with ghosts ” ; 388 , “ furies snatch the engraving pen ” ; 390-392 , “ Tir 'd of his long continued victory : What glory can there be to vanquish those Who all beneath his stroke are sure to die ? ” 398 , “ Is borne secure , and rides aloft in state ” ; 399 , “ No , the stars ” ; 410 , “ Burst from the skies the fury of a blast ” ; 411 , “ Round the four eaves ” ; 414 , “ Sport with the sands ” ; 417 , “ Lights through the air like blazing stars ” ; 420 , “ As if afraid the fearful ” ; 424 , “ its dreary song ” ; 441 , “ Now from within ” ; 451 , “ Roar 'd like a devil ; while the woods around ” ; 458-460 , “ Haste , seize the wretch who my request denies .

Do they portend approaching death , which tells I soon must hence my darksome journey go ? Sweet Cherub Hope ! Dispel the clouded dream Sweet Cherub Hope , man 's guardian god below . Stranger , who'er thou art , who this shall read , Say does thy nightly fancy rove like mine ; Transport thee o'er wide lands and wider seas Now underneath the pole and now the burning line ? Poet , who thus dost rove , say , shall thou fear New Jordan 's stream prefigured by the old ? It will but waft thee where thy fathers are The bards with long eternity enroll 'd . It will but waft thee where thy Homer shrouds His laurell 'd head in some Elysian grove , And on whose skirts perhaps in future years , At awful distance you and I may rove . Enough — when God and nature give the word , I 'll tempt the dusky shore and narrow sea : Content to die , just as it be decreed , At four score years , or now at twenty-three . ” In the edition of 1795 , Freneau used only stanzas 3-17 , 119-124 of the poem , giving it the title “ The Vision of the Night . A Fragment . ” In this there are some sixteen variations from the earlier text , nearly all minor verbal changes not always for the better . Several , however , are significant , for instance , line 12 is made to read , “ I sing the horrors and the shades of night ” ; line 32 is changed to “ with her ebon spear ” ; line 478 to “ raised by churchmen 's hands ” ; and 480 to “ texts from Moses . ” The poet used the 1786 edition as a sort of quarry for his later editions . He used thirteen stanzas for “ The Sexton 's Sermon , ” q. v . ; stanzas 39-43 were reprinted in the 1809 edition in connection with stanzas 35-38 of “ Santa Cruz ” and entitled “ Elegiac Lines ” ; stanza 79 became stanza one and 55 stanza two of the “ Hessian Embarkation , ” and stanza 49 was inserted after stanza 90 of the 1809 version of “ Santa Cruz . ” THE JAMAICA FUNERAL<span type="note_anchor">[ 157 ]</span>1776 1 Alcander died — the rich , the great , the brave ; Even such must yield to heaven 's severe decree , Death , still at hand , conducts us to the grave , And humbles monarchs as he humbled thee . 2 When , lingering , to his end Alcander drew , Officious friends besieg 'd his lofty door , Impatient they the dying man to view And touch that hand they soon must touch no more . 3 “ Alas , he 's gone ! ” the sad attendants cry , Fled is the breath that never shall return — “ Alas ! he 's gone ! ” his tearful friends reply , “ Spread the dark crape , and round his pale corpse mourn . 4 “ Ye that attend the pompous funeral , due , “ In sable vestments let your limbs be clad , “ For vulgar deaths a common sorrow shew , “ But costly griefs are for the wealthy dead . 5 “ Prepare the blessings of the generous vine , “ Let bulls and oxen groan beneath the steel , “ Throughout the board let choicest dainties shine , “ To every guest a generous portion deal . ” 6 A mighty crowd approach 'd the mourning dome , Some came to hear the sermon and the prayer , Some came to shun Xantippe 's voice at home , And some with Bacchus to relieve their care . 7 A Levite came , and sigh 'd among the rest , A rusty band and tatter 'd gown he wore , His leaves he tumbled , and the house he blest , And conn 'd his future sermon o'er and o'er . 8 And oft a glance he cast towards the wine That briskly sparkled in the glassy vase , And often drank , and often wish 'd to dine , And red as Phoebus glow 'd his sultry face . 9 Much did he chatter , and on various themes , He publish 'd news that came from foreign climes , He told his jests , and told his last year 's dreams , And quoted dull stuff from lord Wilmot 's rhymes . 10 And dunn 'd the mourners for his parish dues With face of brass , and scrutinizing eye , And threaten 'd law-suits if they dar 'd refuse To pay his honest earnings punctually . 11 An honest sire , who came in luckless hour To hear the sermon and to see the dead , Presuming on this consecrated hour , Ventur 'd to check the parson on that head . 12 Quoth he , “ My priest , such conduct is not fit , “ For other speech this solemn hour demands : “ What if your parish owes its annual debt , “ Your parish ready to discharge it stands . ” 13 No more he said — for charg 'd with wounds and pain , The parson 's staff , like Jove 's own lightning , flew , Which cleft his jaw-bone and his cheek in twain , And from their sockets half his grinders drew . 14 Nor less deceas 'd some moments lay the sire Than if from heav'n the forked lightnings thrown Had pierc 'd him with their instantaneous fire , And sent him smoking to the world unknown . 15 At last he mov 'd , and , weltering in his gore . Thus did the rueful , wounded victim say , “ Convey me hence — so bloody and so sore “ I cannot wait to hear the parson pray ; 16 “ And if I did , what pleasure could be mine — “ Can he allure me to the world of bliss — “ Can he present me at the heavenly shrine “ Who breaks my bones , and knocks me down in this ? 17 “ The scripture says — the text I well recall — “ A Priest or Bishop must no striker be , “ Then how can such a wicked priest but fall , “ Who at a funeral thus has murdered me ? ” 18 Thus he — But now the sumptuous dinner came , The Levite ; boldly seiz 'd the nobler place , Beside him sate the woe-struck widow 'd dame , Who help 'd him drain the brimful china vase . 19 Which now renew 'd , he drank that ocean too , Like Polypheme , the boon Ulysses gave ; Another came , nor did another do , For still another did the monster crave . 20 With far-fetch 'd dainties he regal 'd his maw , And prais 'd the various meats that crown 'd the board : On tender capons did the glutton gnaw , And well his platter with profusion stor 'd . 21 But spoke no words of grace — I mark 'd him well , I fix 'd my eye upon his brazen brow — He look 'd like Satan aiming to rebel , Such pride and madness were his inmates now . 22 But not contented with this hectoring priest , Sick of his nonsense , softly I withdrew , And at a calmer table shar 'd the feast , To sorrow sacred , and to friendship due . 23 Which now atchiev 'd , the tolling bell remote Summon 'd the living and the dead to come , And through the dying sea-breeze swell 'd the note , Dull on the ear , and lengthening through the gloom . 24 The bier was brought , the costly coffin laid , And prayers were mutter 'd in a doleful tone , While the sad pall , above the body spread , From many a tender breast drew many a groan . 25 The Levite , too , some tears of Bacchus shed — Reeling before the long procession , he Strode like a general at his army 's head , His gown in tatters , and his wig — ah me ! 26 The words of faith in both his hands he bore , Prayers , cut and dry , by ancient prelates made , Who , bigots while they liv 'd , could do no more Than leave them still by bigots to be said . 27 But he admir 'd them all !— he read with joy St. Athanasius in his thundering creed , And curs 'd the men whom Satan did employ To make King Charles , that heav'nhYpppHeNborn martyr , bleed . 28 At last they reach 'd the spiry building high , And soon they enter 'd at the eastern gate — The parson said his prayers most learnedly , And mutter 'd more than memory can relate . 29 Then through the temple 's lengthy aisles they went , Approaching still the pulpit 's painted door , From whence , on Sundays , many a vow was sent , And sermons plunder 'd from some prelate 's store . 30 Here , as of right , the priest prepar 'd to rise , And leave the corpse and gaping crowd below , Like sultry Phoebus glar 'd his flaming eyes , Less fierce the stars of Greenland evenings glow . 31 Up to the pulpit strode he with an air , And from the Preacher thus his text he read : “ More I esteem , and better is by far “ A dog existing than a lion dead . 32 “ Go , eat thy dainties with a joyful heart , “ And quaff thy wine with undissembled glee , “ For he who did these heavenly gifts impart “ Accepts thy prayers , thy gifts , thy vows , and thee . ” THE SERMON 33 These truths , my friends , congenial to my soul , Demand a faithful and attentive ear — No longer for your ‘ parted friend condole , No longer shed the tributary tear . 34 Curs 'd be the sobs , these useless floods of woe That vainly flow for the departed dead — If doom 'd to wander on the coasts below , What are to him these seas of grief you shed ? 35 If heaven in pleasure doth his hours employ — If sighs and sorrows reach a place like this , They blast his glories , and they damp his joy , They make him wretched in the midst of bliss . 36 And can you yet — and here he smote his breast — And can you yet bemoan that torpid mass Which now for death and desolation drest , Prepares the deep gulph of the grave to pass . 37 You fondly mourn — I mourn Alcander too , Alcander late the living , not the dead ; His casks I broach 'd , his liquors once I drew , And freely there on choicest dainties fed . 38 But vanish 'd are they now !— no more he calls , No more invites me to his plenteous board ; No more I caper at his splendid balls , Or drain his cellars , with profusion stor 'd . 39 Then why , my friends , for yonder senseless clay , That ne'er again befriends me , should I mourn ? Yon ’ simple slaves that through the cane-lands stray Are more to me than monarchs in the urn . 40 The joys of wine , immortal as my theme , To days of bliss the aspiring soul invite ; Life , void of this , a punishment I deem , A Greenland winter , without heat or light . 41 Count all the trees that crown Jamaica 's hills , Count all the stars that through the heavens you see . Count every drop that the wide ocean fills ; Then count the pleasures Bacchus yields to me . 42 The aids of wine for toiling man were meant ; I prize the smiling Caribbean bowl — Enjoy those gifts that bounteous nature lent , Death to thy cares , refreshing to the soul . 43 Here fixt to-day in plenty 's smiling vales , Just as the month revolves we laugh or groan , September comes , seas swell with horrid gales , And old Port Royal 's fate may be our own . 44 A few short years , at best , will bound our span , Wretched and few , the Hebrew exile said ; Live while you may , be jovial while you can , Death as a debt to nature must be paid . 45 When nature fails , the man exists no more , And death is nothing but an empty name , Spleen 's genuine offspring at the midnight hour , The coward 's tyrant , and the bad man 's dream . 46 You ask me where these mighty hosts have fled , That once existed on this changeful ball ?— If aught remains , when mortal man is dead , Where , ere their birth they were , they now are all . [ A ] [ A ] “ Quaeris , quo jaceas post obitum loco ?— Quo non nata jacent . ” — Senec . Troas .— Freneau 's note . 47 Like insects busy , in a summer 's day , We toil and squabble , to increase our pain , Night comes at last , and , weary of the fray , To dust and darkness all return again . 48 Then envy not , ye sages too precise , The drop from life 's gay tree , that damps our woe , Noah himself , the wary and the wise , A vineyard planted , and the vines did grow : 49 Of social soul was he — the grape he press 'd , And drank the juice oblivious to his care ; Sorrow he banish 'd from his place of rest , And sighs and sobbing had no entrance there . 50 Such bliss be ours through every changing scene ; The glowing face bespeaks the glowing heart ; If heaven be joy , wine is to heaven a-kin , Since wine , on earth , can heavenly joys impart . 51 Mere glow-worms are we all , a moment shine ; I , like the rest , in giddy circles run , And Grief shall say , when I this life resign , “ His glass is empty , and his frolics done ! ” 52 He said , and ceas 'd — the funeral anthem then From the deep choir and hoarse-ton 'd organ came ; Such are the honours paid to wealthy men , But who for Irus would attempt the same ? 53 Now from the church returning , as they went , Again they reach 'd Alcander 's painted hall , Their sighs concluded , and their sorrows spent , They to oblivion gave the Funeral . 54 The holy man , by bishops holy made , Tun 'd up to harmony his trembling strings , To various songs in various notes he play 'd , And , as he plays , as gallantly he sings . 55 The widow 'd dame , less pensive than before , To sprightly tunes as sprightly did advance , Her lost Alcander scarce remember 'd more ; And thus the funeral ended in a dance .<span type="note_anchor">[ 157 ]</span>As far as I can discover , this poem occurs only in the edition of 1786 . Freneau seems deliberately to have abandoned it after this edition . A few stanzas from this poem are scattered through the poem entitled “ The Sexton 's Sermon , ” q. v . Stanza 43 was inserted after stanza 15 of the later versions of “ Santa Cruz . ” THE BEAUTIES OF SANTA CRUZ [ A ][ 158 ] 1776 Sweet orange grove , the fairest of the isle , In thy soft shade luxuriously reclin 'd , Where , round my fragrant bed , the flowrets smile , In sweet delusions I deceive my mind . But Melancholy 's glooms assail my breast , For potent nature reigns despotic here ;— A nation ruin 'd , and a world oppress 'd , Might rob the boldest Stoic of a tear . [ A ] Or St. Croix , a Danish island ( in the American Archipelago ) , commonly , tho ’ erroneously included in the cluster of the Virgin Islands ; belonging to the crown of Denmark .— Freneau 's note [ Ed . 1809 ] . 1 Sick of thy northern glooms , come , shepherd , seek More equal climes , and a serener sky : Why shouldst thou toil amid thy frozen ground , Where half year 's snows , a barren prospect lie , 2 When thou mayst go where never frost was seen , Or north-west winds with cutting fury blow , Where never ice congeal 'd the limpid stream , Where never mountain tipt its head with snow ? 3 Twice seven days prosperous gales thy barque shall bear To isles that flourish in perpetual green , Where richest herbage glads each shady vale , And ever verdant plants on every hill are seen . 4 Nor dread the dangers of the billowy deep , Autumnal winds shall safely waft thee o'er ; Put off the timid heart , or , man unblest , Ne'er shalt thou reach this gay enchanting shore . 5 Thus Judah 's tribes beheld the promis 'd land , While Jordan 's angry waters swell 'd between ; Thus trembling on the brink I see them stand , Heav'n ' s type in view , the Canaanitish green . 6 Thus , some mean souls , in spite of age and care , Are so united to this globe below , They never wish to cross death 's dusky main , That parting them and happiness doth flow . 7 Though reason 's voice might whisper to the soul That nobler climes for man the gods design — Come , shepherd , haste — the northern breezes blow , No more the slumbering winds thy barque confine . 8 From the vast caverns of old ocean 's bed , Fair Santa Cruz , arising , laves her waist , The threat'ning waters roar on every side , For every side by ocean is embrac 'd . 9 Sharp , craggy rocks repel the surging brine , Whose cavern 'd sides by restless billows wore , Resemblance claim to that remoter isle [ Eolia Where once the winds ’ proud lord the sceptre bore . 10 Betwixt old Cancer and the mid-way line , In happiest climate lies this envied isle , Trees bloom throughout the year , streams ever flow , And fragrant Flora wears a lasting smile . 11 Cool , woodland streams from shaded clifts descend , The dripping rock no want of moisture knows , Supply 'd by springs that on the skies depend , That fountain feeding as the current flows . 12 Such were the isles which happy Flaccus sung , Where one tree blossoms while another bears , Where spring forever gay , and ever young , Walks her gay round through her unwearied years . 13 Such were the climes which youthful Eden saw Ere crossing fates destroy 'd her golden reign — Reflect upon thy loss , unhappy man , And seek the vales of Paradise again . 14 No lowering skies are here — the neighbouring sun Clear and unveil 'd , his brilliant journey goes , Each morn emerging from the ambient main , And sinking there each evening to repose . 15 In June 's fair month the spangled traveller gains The utmost limits of his northern way , And blesses with his beams cold lands remote , Sad Greenland 's coast , and Hudson 's frozen bay . 16 The shivering swains of those unhappy climes Behold the side-way monarch through the trees , We feel his fiercer heat , his vertic beams , Temper 'd with cooling winds and trade-wind breeze . 17 Yet , though so near heav'n ' s blazing lamp doth run , We court the beam that sheds the golden day , And hence are called the children of the sun , Who , without fainting , bear his downward ray . 18 No threatening tides upon our island rise , Gay Cynthia scarce disturbs the ocean here , No waves approach her orb , and she , as kind , Attracts no water to her silver sphere . 19 The happy waters boast , of various kinds , Unnumber 'd myriads of the scaly race , Sportive they glide above the delug 'd sand , Gay as their clime , in ocean 's ample vase . 20 Some streak 'd with burnish 'd gold , resplendent glare , Some cleave the limpid deep , all silver 'd o'er , Some , clad in living green , delight the eye , Some red , some blue ; of mingled colours more . 21 Here glides the spangled Dolphin through the deep , The giant-carcas 'd whales at distance stray . The huge green turtles wallow through the wave , Well pleas 'd alike with land or water , they . 22 The Rainbow cuts the deep , of varied green , The well fed Grouper lurks remote , below , The swift Bonetta coasts the watry scene , The diamond coated Angels kindle as they go . 23 Delicious to the taste , salubrious food , Which might some temperate studious sage allure To curse the fare of his abstemious school , And turn , for once , a cheerful Epicure . 24 Unhurt , may'st thou this luscious food enjoy , To fulness feast upon the scaly kind ; These , well selected from a thousand more , Delight the taste , and leave no plague behind . 25 Nor think Hygeia [ B ] is a stranger here ; To sensual souls the climate may fatal prove , Anguish and death attend , and pain severe , The midnight revel , and licentious love . [ B ] Goddess of Health .— Freneau 's note . 26 Full many a swain , in youth 's serenest bloom , Is borne untimely to this alien clay , Constrain 'd to slumber in a foreign tomb , Far from his friends , his country far away . 27 Yet , if devoted to a sensual soul , If fondly their own ruin they create , These victims to the banquet and the bowl Must blame their folly only , not their fate . 28 But thou , who first drew breath in northern air , At early dawn ascend the sloping hills , And oft ’ at noon to lime tree shades repair , Where some soft stream from neighbouring groves distils . 29 And with it mix the liquid of the lime , The old ag 'd essence of the generous cane , And sweetest syrups of this liquorish clime , And drink , to cool thy thirst , and drink again . 30 This happy beverage , joy inspiring bowl , Dispelling far the shades of mental night , Wakes bright ideas on the raptur 'd soul , And sorrow turns to pleasure and delight . 31 Sweet verdant isle , through thy dark woods I rove , And learn the nature of each native tree , The fustick hard , the poisonous manchineel , Which for its fragrant apple pleaseth thee : 32 Alluring to the smell , fair to the eye , But deadliest poison in the taste is found — O shun the dangerous tree , nor taste , like Eve , This interdicted fruit in Eden 's ground . 33 The lowly mangrove , fond of watry soil , The white bark 'd gregory , rising high in air , The mastick in the woods you may descry , Tamarind , and lofty plumb-trees flourish there . 34 Sweet orange groves in lonely vallies rise And drop their fruits , unnotic 'd and unknown , And cooling acid limes in hedges grow , The juicy lemons swell in shades their own . 35 Once in these groves divine Aurelia stray 'd !— Then , conscious nature , smiling , look 'd more gay ; But soon she left the dear delightful shade , The shade , neglected , droops and dies away , 36 And pines for her return , but pines in vain , In distant isles belov 'd Aurelia died , Pride of the plains , ador 'd by every swain , Sweet warbler of the woods , and of the woods the pride . 37 Philander early left this rural maid , Nor yet return 'd , by fate compell 'd to roam , But absent from the heavenly girl he stray 'd , Her charms forgot , forgot his native home . 38 O fate severe , to seize the nymph so soon , The nymph , for whom a thousand shepherds sigh , And in the space of one revolving moon To doom the fair one and her swain to die ! 39 Sweet , spungy plumbs on trees wide spreading hang , Bell-apples here , suspended , shade the ground , Plump grenadilloes and gueavas grey , With melons in each plain and lawn abound . 40 The conic form 'd cashew , of juicy kind , Which bears at once an apple and a nut ; Whose poisonous coat , indignant to the lip , Doth in its cell a wholesome kernel shut . 41 The prince of fruits , whom some jayama call , Anana some , the happy flavour 'd pine ; In which unite the tastes and juices all Of apple , peach , quince , grape , and nectarine , 42 Grows to perfection here , and spreads his crest ; His diadem toward the parent sun ; His diadem , in fiery blossoms drest , Stands arm 'd with swords from potent nature won . 43 Yon ’ cotton shrubs with bursting knobs behold , Their snow white locks these humble groves array ; On slender trees the blushing coffee hangs Like thy fair cherry , and would tempt thy stay . 44 Safe from the winds , in deep retreats , they rise ; Their utmost summit may thy arm attain ; Taste the moist fruit , and from thy closing eyes Sleep shall retire , with all his drowsy train . 45 The spicy berry , they gueava call , Swells in the mountains on a stripling tree ; These some admire , and value more than all , My humble verse , besides , unfolds to thee . 46 The smooth white cedar , here , delights the eye , The bay-tree , with its aromatic green , The sea-side grapes , sweet natives of the sand , And pulse , of various kinds , on trees are seen . 47 Here mingled vines that downward shadows cast , Here , cluster 'd grapes from loaded boughs depend , Their leaves no frosts , their fruits no cold winds blast , But , rear 'd by suns , to time alone they bend . 48 The plantane and banana flourish here , Of hasty growth , and love to fix their root Where some soft stream of ambling water flows , To yield full moisture to their cluster 'd fruit . 49 No other trees so vast a leaf can boast , So broad , so long — through these refresh 'd I stray , And though the noon-sun all his radiance shed , These friendly leaves shall shade me all the way , 50 And tempt the cooling breeze to hasten there , With its sweet odorous breath to charm the grove ; High shades and verdant seats , while underneath A little stream by mossy banks doth rove , 51 Where once the Indian dames slept with their swains , Or fondly kiss 'd the moon-light eves away ; The lovers fled , the tearful stream remains , And only I console it with my lay . 52 Among the shades of yonder whispering grove The green palmittoes mingle , tall and fair , That ever murmur , and forever move , Fanning with wavy bough the ambient air . 53 Pomegranates grace the wild , and sweet-sops there Ready to fall , require thy helping hand , Nor yet neglect the papaw or mamee Whose slighted trees with fruits unheeded stand . 54 Those shaddocks juicy shall thy taste delight , And yon ’ high fruits , the richest of the wood , That cling in clusters to the mother tree , The cocoa-nut ; rich , milky , healthful food . 55 O grant me , gods , if yet condemn 'd to stray , At least to spend life 's sober evening here , To plant a grove where winds yon ’ shelter 'd bay , And pluck these fruits that frost nor winter fear . 56 Cassada shrubs abound — transplanted here From every clime , exotic blossoms blow ; Here Asia plants her flowers , here Europe seeds , And hyperborean plants , un-winter 'd , grow . 57 Here , a new herbage glads the generous steed , Mules , goats , and sheep enjoy these pastures fair , And for thy hedges , nature has decreed , Guards of thy toils , the date and prickly pear . 58 But chief the glory of these Indian isles Springs from the sweet , uncloying sugar-cane , Hence comes the planter 's wealth , hence commerce sends Such floating piles to traverse half the main . 59 Whoe'er thou art that leav'st thy native shore , And shall to fair West India climates come , Taste not the enchanting plant — to taste forbear , If ever thou wouldst reach thy much lov 'd home . 60 Ne'er through the Isle permit thy feet to rove , Or , if thou dost , let prudence lead the way , Forbear to taste the virtues of the cane , Forbear to taste what will complete thy stay . 61 Whoever sips of this enchanting juice , Delicious nectar , fit for Jove 's own hall , Returns no more from his lov 'd Santa Cruz , But quits his friends , his country , and his all . 62 And thinks no more of home — Ulysses so Dragg 'd off by force his sailors from that shore Where lotos grew , and , had not strength prevail 'd , They never would have sought their country more . 63 No annual toil inters this thrifty plant , The stalk lopt off , the freshening showers prolong , To future years , unfading and secure , The root so vigorous , and the juice so strong . 64 Unnumber 'd plants , besides , these climates yield , And grass peculiar to the soil , that bears Ten thousand varied herbs , array the field , This glads thy palate , that thy health repairs . 65 Along the shore a wondrous flower is seen , Where rocky ponds receive the surging wave , Some drest in yellow , some array 'd in green , Beneath the water their gay branches lave . 66 This mystic plant , with its bewitching charms , Too surely springs from some enchanted bower ; Fearful it is , and dreads impending harms , And Animal the natives call the flower . 67 From the smooth rock its little branches rise , The objects of thy view , and that alone , Feast on its beauties with thy ravish 'd eyes , But aim to touch it , and — the flower is gone . 68 Nay , if thy shade but intercept the beam That gilds their boughs beneath the briny lake , Swift they retire , like a deluding dream , And even a shadow for destruction take . 69 Warn 'd by experience , seek not thou to gain The magic plant thy curious hand invades ; Returning to the light , it mocks thy pain , Deceives all grasp , and seeks its native shades . 70 On yonder steepy hill , fresh harvests rise , Where the dark tribe from Afric 's sun-burnt plain Oft o'er the ocean turn their wishful eyes To isles remote high looming o'er the main , 71 And view soft seats of ease and fancied rest , Their native groves new painted on the eye , Where no proud misers their gay hours molest , No lordly despots pass unsocial by . 72 See yonder slave that slowly bends this way , With years , and pain , and ceaseless toil opprest , Though no complaining words his woes betray , The eye dejected proves the heart distrest . 73 Perhaps in chains he left his native shore , Perhaps he left a helpless offspring there , Perhaps a wife , that he must see no more , Perhaps a father , who his love did share . 74 Curs 'd be the ship that brought him o'er the main , And curs 'd the hands who from his country tore , May she be stranded , ne'er to float again , May they be shipwreck 'd on some hostile shore — 75 O gold accurst , of every ill the spring , For thee compassion flies the darken 'd mind , Reason 's plain dictates no conviction bring , And passion only sways all human kind . 76 O gold accurst ! for thee we madly run With murderous hearts across the briny flood , Seek foreign climes beneath a foreign sun , And there exult to shed a brother 's blood . 77 But thou , who own'st this sugar-bearing soil , To whom no good the great First Cause denies , Let freeborn hands attend thy sultry toil , And fairer harvests to thy view shall rise . 78 The teeming earth shall mightier stores disclose Than ever struck thy longing eyes before , And late content shall shed a soft repose , Repose , so long a stranger at thy door . 79 Give me some clime , the favourite of the sky , Where cruel slavery never sought to rein — But shun the theme , sad muse , and tell me why These abject trees lie scatter 'd o'er the plain ? 80 These isles , lest nature should have prov 'd too kind , Or man have sought his happiest heaven below , Are torn with mighty winds , fierce hurricanes , Nature convuls 'd in every shape of woe . 81 Nor scorn yon ’ lonely vale of trees so reft ; There plantane groves late grew of lively green , The orange flourish 'd , and the lemon bore , The genius of the isle dwelt there unseen . 82 Wild were the skies , affrighted nature groan 'd As though approach 'd her last decisive day , Skies blaz 'd around , and bellowing winds had nigh Dislodg 'd these cliffs , and tore yon ’ hills away . 83 O'er the wild main , dejected and afraid , The trembling pilot lash 'd his helm a-lee , Or , swiftly scudding , ask 'd thy potent aid , Dear pilot of the Galilean sea . 84 Low hung the clouds , distended with the gale The clouds dark brooding wing 'd their circling flight , Tremendous thunders join 'd the hurricane , Daughter of chaos and eternal night . 85 And how , alas ! could these fair trees withstand The wasteful madness of so fierce a blast , That storm 'd along the plain , seiz 'd every grove , And delug 'd with a sea this mournful waste . 86 That plantane grove , where oft I fondly stray 'd , Thy darts , dread Phoebus , in those glooms to shun , Is now no more a refuge or a shade , Is now with rocks and deep sands over-run . 87 Those late proud domes of splendour , pomp and ease No longer strike the view , in grand attire ; But , torn by winds , flew piece-meal to the seas , Nor left one nook to lodge the astonish 'd squire . 88 But other groves the hand of Time shall raise , Again shall nature smile , serenely gay , So soon each scene revives , why should I leave These green retreats , o'er the dark seas to stray ? 89 For I must go where the mad pirate roves , A stranger on the inhospitable main , Torn from the scenes of Hudson 's sweetest groves , Led by false hope , and expectation vain . 90 There endless plains deject the wearied eye , And hostile winds incessant toil prepare ; And should loud bellowing storms all art defy , The manly heart alone must conquer there . 91 On these blue hills , to pluck the opening flowers , Might yet awhile the unwelcome task delay , And these gay scenes prolong the fleeting hours To aid bright Fancy on some future day . 92 Thy vales , Bermuda , and thy sea-girt groves , Can never like these southern forests please ; And , lash 'd by stormy waves , you court in vain The northern shepherd to your cedar trees . 93 Not o'er those isles such equal planets rule , All , but the cedar , dread the wintry blast : Too well thy charms the banish 'd Waller sung ; Too near the pilot 's star thy doom is cast . 94 Far o'er the waste of yonder surgy field My native climes in fancied prospect lie , Now hid in shades , and now by clouds conceal 'd , And now by tempests ravish 'd from my eye . 95 There , triumphs to enjoy , are , Britain , thine , There , thy proud navy awes the pillag 'd shore ; Nor sees the day when nations shall combine That pride to humble and our rights restore . 96 Yet o'er the globe shouldst thou extend thy reign , Here may thy conquering arms one grotto spare ; Here — though thy conquest vex — in spite of pain , I quaff the enlivening glass , in spite of care . 97 What , though we bend to a tyrannic crown ; Still Nature 's charms in varied beauty shine — What though we own the proud imperious Dane , Gold is his sordid care , the Muses mine . 98 Winter , and winter 's glooms are far remov 'd ; Eternal spring with smiling summer join 'd ;— Absence and death , and heart-corroding care , Why should they cloud the sun-shine of the mind ? 99 But , shepherd , haste , and leave behind thee far Thy bloody plains , and iron glooms above , Quit the cold northern star , and here enjoy , Beneath the smiling skies , this land of love . 100 The drowsy pelican wings home his way , The misty eve sits heavy on the sea , And though yon ’ sail drags slowly o'er the main , Say , shall a moment 's gloom discourage thee ? 101 To-morrow 's sun now paints the faded scene , Though deep in ocean sink his western beams , His spangled chariot shall ascend more clear , More radiant from the drowsy land of dreams . 102 Of all the isles the neighbouring ocean bears , None can with this their equal landscapes boast : What could we do on Saba 's cloudy height ; Or what could please on ‘ Statia 's barren coast ? 103 Couldst thou content on rough Tortola stray , Confest the fairest of the Virgin train ; Or couldst thou on these rocky summits play Where high St. John stands frowning o'er the main ? 104 Haste , shepherd , haste — Hesperian fruits for thee , And cluster 'd grapes from mingled boughs depend — What pleasure in thy forests can there be That , leafless now , to every tempest bend ? 105 To milder stars , and skies of clearer blue , Sworn foe to arms , at least a-while repair , And , till to mightier force proud Britain bends , Despise her triumphs , and deceive thy care . 106 Soon shall the genius of the fertile soil A new creation to thy view unfold ; Admire the works of Nature 's magic hand , But scorn that vulgar bait , all potent gold . 107 Yet , if persuaded by no lay of mine , You still admire your climes of frost and snow , And pleas 'd , prefer above our southern groves The darksome forests , that around thee grow : 108 Still there remain — thy native air enjoy , Repell the tyrant who thy peace invades , While , pleas 'd , I trace the vales of Santa Cruz , And sing with rapture her inspiring shades .<span type="note_anchor">[ 158 ]</span>Text from the edition of 1786 . The poem was first published in the February ( 1779 ) issue of the United States Magazine , as a part of an extended article , with the title , “ Account of the Island of Santa Cruz : Containing an original Poem on the Beauties of that Island . In a letter to A. P. Esq . ” The poem is introduced as follows : “ I believe the best thing I can do with the rest of this paper is to transcribe a few dull heavy lines which I composed near two years ago on the spot . ” The poem consisted of fifty-two stanzas , corresponding to the following above : 1-4 , 6-10 , 14-16 , 18-23 , 31-34 , 39 , 40 , 48-51 , 53 , 54 , 56 , 58-63 , 70 , 79-82 , 85 , 88 , 96 , 98 , 100 , 101 , 104 , 106-108 . Freneau revised it with a careful hand for his edition of 1786 . Some of the lines changed most notably are as follows : Stanza 1 . “ Less rigorous climes , and a more friendly sky . ” 6 . “ So some dull minds , in spite of age and care , Are grown so wedded to this globe below . ” 39 . “ Sweet spungy plumbs on trees wide spreading hang , The happy flavour 'd pine grows crested from the ground . ” 51 . “ Where once the Indian dames inchanted slept . ” 56 . “ Cassada shrubs abound , whose poison root , Supplies the want of snow-white Northern flour ; This grated fine , and steep 'd in water fair , Forsakes each particle of noxious power . ” 70 . “ On yonder peaked hill fresh harvests rise , Where wretched he — the Ethiopian swain . ” 79 . “ He pants a land of freedom and repose , Where cruel slavery never sought to reign , O quit thee them , my muse , and tell me why . ” 88 . “ But now the winds are past , the storm subsides , All nature smiles again serenely gay , The beauteous groves renew 'd — how shall I leave My green retreat at Butler 's verdant bay . ” 96 . “ Fain would I view my native climes again , But murder marks the cruel Briton there — Contented here I rest , in spite of pain , And quaff the enlivening juice in spite of care . ” 100 . “ The misty night sits heavy on the sea , Yon lagging sail drags slowly o'er the main , Night and its kindred glooms are nought to me . ” 104 . “ Then shepherd haste , and leave behind thee far The bloody plains and iron glooms above , Quit thy cold northern star , and here enjoy , Beneath the smiling skies this land of love . ” Each of the later editions passed under the revising pen of Freneau , but the variations consisted largely of verbal changes . As a sample of his revision , note the following : Stanza 3 , 1779 , “ Two weeks , with prosperous gales ” ; 1786 , “ Twice seven days prosperous gales ” ; 1809 , “ Twice ten days prosperous gales ” ; 26 , 1779 , “ And tho ’ fierce Sol his beams directly shed ” ; 1786 , “ And though the noon-sun all his radiance shed ” ; 1795 , “ The noon sun his fierce radiance shed ” ; 30 , 1779 , “ fruits that over-top the wood ” ; 1786 , “ fruits , the richest of the wood ” ; 1795 , “ fruits the noblest of the wood ” ; 38 , 1779 , “ peaked hill ” ; 1786 , “ steepy hill ” ; 1795 , “ blue-brow 'd hill ” ; 41 , 1779 , “ lovely green ” ; 1786 , “ lively green ” ; 1795 , “ liveliest green . ” Freneau added three stanzas to the later versions . After stanza 16 above , be added the following : “ The native here , in golden plenty blest , Bids from the soil the verdant harvests spring ; Feasts in the abundant dome , the joyous guest ; Time short ,— life easy ,— pleasure on the wing . ” Following this he added stanza 43 of “ The Jamaica Funeral . ” Stanza 49 of “ The House of Night ” was interpolated between 90 and 91 . Stanzas 35-38 were omitted from the 1786 version , and in connection with stanzas 39-43 of “ The House of Night , ” became the “ Elegiac Lines ” of the later editions . The text of the 1795 version was almost unrevised for the 1809 edition . ON A HESSIAN DEBARKATION<span type="note_anchor">[ 159 ]</span>1776 There is a book , tho ’ not a book of rhymes , Where truth severe records a nation 's crimes ;— To check such monarchs as with brutal might Wanton in blood , and trample on the right . Rejoice , O Death !— Britannia 's tyrant sends From German plains his myriads to our shore ; The Caledonian with the English joined :— Bring them , ye winds , but waft them back no more . To these far climes with stately step they come , Resolved all prayers , all prowess to defy ; Smit with the love of countries not their own , They come , indeed , to conquer — not to die . In the slow breeze ( I hear their funeral song ,) The dance of ghosts the infernal tribes prepare : To hell 's dark mansions haste , ye abandoned throng , Drinking from German sculls old Odin 's beer . From dire Cesarea [ A ] forced , these slaves of kings , Quick , let them take their way on eagle 's wings : To thy strong posts , Manhattan 's isle , repair , To meet the vengeance that awaits them there !

It must have been composed after this edition was published . I have inserted it here on account of its historical significance . Text is from the edition of 1809 . THE JEWISH LAMENTATION AT EUPHRATES<span type="note_anchor">[ 160 ]</span>By Babel 's streams we sate and wept , When Sion bade our sorrows flow ; Our harps on lofty willows slept That near those distant waters grow : The willows high , the waters clear , Beheld our toils and sorrows there . The cruel foe , that captive led Our nation from their native soil , The tyrant foe , by whom we bled , Required a song , as well as toil : “ Come , with a song your sorrows cheer , “ A song , that Sion loved to hear . ” How shall we , cruel tyrant , raise A song on such a distant shore ?— If I forget my Sion 's praise , May my right hand assume no more To strike the silver sounding string , And thence the slumbering music bring . If I forget that happy home , My perjured tongue , forbear to move ! My eyes , be closed in endless gloom — My joy , my rapture , and my love ! No rival grief my mind can share , For thou shalt reign unrivalled there . Remember , Lord , that hated foe ( When conquered Sion drooped her head ) Who laughing at our deepest woe , Thus to our tears and sorrows said , “ From its proud height degrade her wall , “ Destroy her towers — and ruin all . ” Thou , Babel 's offspring , hated race , May some avenging monster seize , And dash your venom in your face For crimes and cruelties like these : And , deaf to pity 's melting moan , With infant blood stain every stone .<span type="note_anchor">[ 160 ]</span>First published in the United States Magazine for September , 1779 , under the title , “ Psalm CXXXVII Imitated .

When God from chaos gave this world to be , Man then he formed , and formed him to be free , In his own image stampt the favourite race — How darest thou , tyrant , the fair stamp deface ! When on mankind you fix your abject chains , No more the image of that God remains ; O'er a dark scene a darker shade is drawn , His work dishonoured , and our glory gone ! When first Britannia sent her hostile crew To these far shores , to ravage and subdue , We thought them gods , and almost seemed to say No ball could pierce them , and no dagger slay — Heavens ! what a blunder — half our fears were vain ; These hostile gods at length have quit the plain , On neighbouring isles the storm of war they shun , Happy , thrice happy , if not quite undone . Yet soon , in dread of some impending woe , Even from these islands shall these ruffians go — This be their doom , in vengeance for the slain , To pass their days in poverty and pain ; For such base triumphs , be it still their lot To triumph only o'er the rebel Scot , And to their insect isle henceforth confined No longer lord it o'er the human kind .— But , by the fates , who still prolong their stay , And gather vengeance to conclude their day , Yet , ere they go , the angry Muse shall tell The treasured woes that in her bosom swell :— Proud , fierce , and bold , O Jove ! who would not laugh To see these bullies worshipping a calf : But they are slaves who spurn at Reason 's rules ; And men , once slaves , are soon transformed to fools .— To recommend what monarchies have done , They bring , for witness , David and his son ; How one was brave , the other just and wise , And hence our plain Republics they despise ; But mark how oft , to gratify their pride , The people suffered , and the people died ; Though one was wise , and one Goliah slew , Kings are the choicest curse that man e'er knew ! Hail , worthy Briton !— how enlarged your fame ; How great your glory , terrible your name ; “ Queen of the isles , and empress of the main , ” — Heaven grant you all these mighty things again ; But first insure the gaping crowd below That you less cruel , and more just may grow : If fate , vindictive for the sins of man , Had favour shown to your infernal plan , How would your nation have exulted here , And scorned the widow 's sigh , the orphan 's tear ! How had your prince , of all bad men the worst , Laid worth and virtue prostrate in the dust ! A second Sawney [ A ] had he shone to-day , A world subdued , and murder but his play ; How had that prince , contemning right or law , Glutted with blood his foul , voracious maw : In him we see the depths of baseness joined , Whate'er disgraced the dregs of human kind ; Cain , Nimrod , Nero — fiends in human guise , Herod , Domitian — these in judgment rise , And , envious of his deeds , I hear them say None but a George could be more vile than they . Swoln though he was with wealth , revenge , and pride , How could he dream that heaven was on his side — Did he not see , when so decreed by fate , They placed the crown upon his royal pate , Did he not see the richest jewel fall — [ B ] Dire was the omen , and astonished all .— That gem no more shall brighten and adorn ; No more that gem by British kings be worn , Or swell to wonted heights of fair renown The fading glories of their boasted crown . Yet he to arms , and war , and blood inclined , ( A fair-day warrior with a feeble mind , Fearless , while others meet the shock of fate , And dare that death , which clips his thread too late . ) He to the fane ( O hypocrite ! ) did go , While not an angel there but was his foe , There did he kneel , and sigh , and sob , and pray , Yet not to lave his thousand sins away , Far other motives swayed his spotted soul ; ‘ Twas not for those the secret sorrow stole Down his pale cheek — ‘ twas vengeance and despair Dissolved his eye , and planted sorrow there ;— How could he hope to bribe the impartial sky By his base prayers , and mean hypocrisy ?— Heaven still is just , and still abhors all crimes , Not acts like George , the Nero of our times . What were his prayers — his prayers could be no more Than a thief 's wishes to recruit his store :— Such prayers could never reach the worlds above ; They were but curses in the ear of Jove ;— You prayed that conquest might your arms attend , And crush that freedom virtue did defend , That the fierce Indian , rousing from his rest , Might these new regions with his flames invest , With scalps and tortures aggravate our woe , And to the infernal world dismiss your foe . No mines of gold our fertile country yields , But mighty harvests crown the loaded fields , Hence , trading far , we gained the golden prize , Which , though our own , bewitched their greedy eyes — For that they ravaged India 's climes before , And carried death to Asia 's utmost shore — Clive was your envied slave , in avarice bold — He mowed down nations for his dearer gold ; The fatal gold could give no true content , He mourned his murders , and to Tophet went . Led on by lust of lucre and renown , Burgoyne came marching with his thousands down , High were his thoughts , and furious his career , Puffed with self-confidence , and pride severe , Swoln with the idea of his future deeds , Onward to ruin each advantage leads : Before his hosts his heaviest curses flew , And conquered worlds rose hourly to his view : His wrath , like Jove 's , could bear with no controul , His words bespoke the mischief in his soul ; To fight was not this general 's only trade , He shined in writing , and his wit displayed — To awe the more with titles of command He told of forts he ruled in Scottish land ;— Queen 's colonel as he was , he did not know That thorns and thistles , mixed with honours , grow ; In Britain 's senate , though he held a place , All did not save him from one long disgrace , One stroke of fortune that convinced them all That men could conquer , and lieutenants fall . Foe to the rights of man , proud plunderer , say Had conquest crowned you on that mighty day When you , to Gates , with sorrow , rage , and shame Resigned your conquests , honours , arms , and fame , When at his feet Britannia 's wreathes you threw , And the sun sickened at a sight so new ; Had you been victor — what a waste of woe ! What souls had vanished to where souls do go ! What dire distress had marked your fatal way , What deaths on deaths disgraced that dismal day ! Can laurels flourish in a soil of blood , Or on those laurels can fair honours bud — Cursed be that wretch who murder makes his trade , Cursed be all wars that e'er ambition made ! What murdering Tory now relieves your grief , Or plans new conquests for his favourite chief ; Designs still dark employ that ruffian race , Beasts of your choosing , and our own disgrace , So vile a crew the world ne'er saw before , And grant , ye pitying heavens , it may no more : If ghosts from hell infest our poisoned air , Those ghosts have entered their base bodies here ; Murder and blood is still their dear delight — Scream round their roofs , ye ravens of the night ! Whene'er they wed , may demons and despair , And grief and woe , and blackest night be there ; Fiends leagued from hell the nuptial lamp display , Swift to perdition light them on their way , Round the wide world their devilish squadrons chace , To find no realm , that grants one resting place . Far to the north , on Scotland 's utmost end An isle there lies , the haunt of every fiend , No shepherds there attend their bleating flocks , But withered witches rove among the rocks ; Shrouded in ice , the blasted mountains show Their cloven heads , to daunt the seas below ; The lamp of heaven in his diurnal race There scarcely deigns to unveil his radiant face , Or if one day he circling treads the sky He views this island with an angry eye , Or ambient fogs their broad , moist wings expand , Damp his bright ray , and cloud the infernal land ; The blackening winds incessant storms prolong , Dull as their night , and dreary as my song ; When stormy winds and gales refuse to blow , Then from the dark sky drives the unpitying snow ; When drifting snows from iron clouds forbear , Then down the hail-stones rattle through the air — There screeching owls , and screaming vultures rest , And not a tree adorns its barren breast ; No peace , no rest , the elements bestow , But seas forever rage , and storms forever blow . There , Loyals , there , with loyal hearts retire , There pitch your tents , and kindle there your fire ; There desert Nature will her stings display , And fiercest hunger on your vitals prey , And with yourselves let John Burgoyne retire To reign the monarch , whom your hearts admire . Britain , at last to arrest your lawless hand , Rises the genius of a generous land , Our injured rights bright Gallia 's prince defends , And from this hour that prince and we are friends ; Feuds , long upheld , are vanished from our view . Once we were foes — but for the sake of you — Britain , aspiring Briton , now must bend — Can she at once with France and us contend , When we alone , remote from foreign aid , Her armies captured , and distressed her trade ? Britain and we no more in combat join , No more , as once , in every sea combine ; Dead is that friendship which did mutual burn , Fled is the sceptre , never to return ; By sea and land , perpetual foes we meet , Our cause more honest , and our hearts as great ; Lost are these regions to Britannia 's reign , Nor need these strangers of their loss complain ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 162 ]</span>Since all , that here with greedy eyes they view , From our own toil to wealth and empire grew . Our hearts are ravished from our former queen Far as the ocean God hath placed between , They strive in vain to join this mighty mass Torn by convulsions from its native place . As well might men to flaming Hecla join The huge high Alps , or towering Appenine : In vain they send their half-commissioned tribe , And whom they cannot conquer , strive to bribe ; Their pride and madness burst our union chain , Nor shall the unwieldy mass unite again . Nor think that France sustains our cause alone ; With gratitude her helping hand we own , But hear , ye nations — Truth herself can say We bore the heat and danger of the day : She calmly viewed the tumult from afar , We braved each insult , and sustained the war : Oft drove the foe , or forced their hosts to yield , Or left them more than once a dear bought field — ‘ Twas then , at last , on Jersey plains distrest , We swore to seek the mountains of the west , There a free empire for our seed obtain , A terror to the slaves that might remain .<span type="note_anchor">[ 163 ]</span>Peace you demand , and vainly wish to find Old leagues renewed , and strength once more combined — Yet shall not all your base dissembling art Deceive the tortures of a bleeding heart — Yet shall not all your mingled prayers that rise Wash out your crimes , or bribe the avenging skies ; Full many a corpse lies mouldering on the plain That ne'er shall see its little brood again : See , yonder lies , all breathless , cold , and pale , Drenched in her gore , Lavinia of the vale ; [ C ] The cruel Indian seized her life away , As the next morn began her bridal day !— This deed alone our just revenge would claim , Did not ten thousand more your sons defame . Returned , a captive , to my native shore , How changed I find those scenes that pleased before ! How changed those groves where fancy loved to stray , When spring 's young blossoms bloom 'd along the way ; From every eye distils the frequent tear , From every mouth some doleful tale I hear ! Some mourn a father , brother , husband , friend : Some mourn , imprisoned in their native land , In sickly ships what numerous hosts confin 'd At once their lives and liberties resigned : In dreary dungeons woeful scenes have passed , Long in the historian 's page the tale will last , As long as spring renews the flowery wood , As long as breezes curl the yielding flood !— Some sent to India 's sickly climes afar , To dig , with slaves , for buried diamonds there , There left to sicken in a land of woe Where o'er scorched hills infernal breezes blow , Whose every blast some dire contagion brings , Fevers or death on its destructive wings , ‘ Till fate relenting , its last arrows drew , Brought death to them , and infamy to you . Pests of mankind ! remembrance shall recall And paint these horrors to the view of all ; Heaven has not turned to its own works a foe Nor left to monsters these fair realms below , Else had your arms more wasteful vengeance spread , And these gay plains been dyed a deeper red . O'er Britain 's isle a thousand woes impend , Too weak to conquer , govern , or defend , To liberty she holds pretended claim — The substance we enjoy , and they the name ; Her prince , surrounded by a host of slaves , Still claims dominion o'er the vagrant waves : Such be his claims o'er all the world beside ,— An empty nothing — madness , rage and pride . From Europe 's realms fair freedom has retired , And even in Britain has the spark expired — Sigh for the change your haughty empire feels , Sigh for the doom that no disguise conceals ! Freedom no more shall Albion 's cliffs survey ; Corruption there has centered all her sway , Freedom disdains her honest head to rear , Or herd with nobles , kings , or princes there ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 164 ]</span>She shuns their gilded spires and domes of state , Resolved , O Virtue , at thy shrine to wait ; ‘ Midst savage woods and wilds she dares to stray , And bids uncultured nature bloom more gay . She is that glorious and immortal sun , Without whose ray this world would be undone , A mere dull chaos , sunk in deepest night , An abject something , void of form and light , Of reptiles , worst in rank , the dire abode , Perpetual mischief , and the dragon 's brood . Let Turks and Russians glut their fields with blood , Again let Britain dye the Atlantic flood , Let all the east adore the sanguine wreathe And gain new glories from the trade of death — America ! the works of peace be thine , Thus shalt thou gain a triumph more divine — To thee belongs a second golden reign , Thine is the empire o'er a peaceful main ; Protect the rights of human kind below , Crush the proud tyrant who becomes their foe , And future times shall own your struggles blest , And future years enjoy perpetual rest . Americans ! revenge your country 's wrongs ; To you the honour of this deed belongs , Your arms did once this sinking land sustain , And saved those climes where Freedom yet must reign — Your bleeding soil this ardent task demands , Expel yon ’ thieves from these polluted lands , Expect no peace till haughty Britain yields , ‘ Till humbled Britons quit your ravaged fields — Still to the charge that routed foe returns , The war still rages , and the battle burns — No dull debates , or tedious counsels know , But rush at once , embodied , on your foe ; With hell-born spite a seven years ’ war they wage , The pirate Goodrich , and the ruffian Gage . Your injured country groans while yet they stay , Attend her groans , and force their hosts away ; Your mighty wrongs the tragic muse shall trace , Your gallant deeds shall fire a future race ; To you may kings and potentates appeal , You may the doom of jarring nations seal ; A glorious empire rises , bright and new ! Firm be the structure , and must rest on you !— Fame o'er the mighty pile expands her wings , Remote from princes , bishops , lords , and kings , Those fancied gods , who , famed through every shore , Mankind have fashioned , and like fools , adore . Here yet shall heaven the joys of peace bestow , While through our soil the streams of plenty flow , And o'er the main we spread the trading sail , Wafting the produce of the rural vale .

Her family were Loyalists ; she herself was engaged to be married to a Loyalist officer . She was dressed to receive her lover when a party of Indians burst into the house , carried off the whole family to the woods , and there murdered , scalped , and mangled them in a most horrible manner . ” — Hildreth 's United States .

The poem was written , according to the edition of 1786 , in August , 1778 .

In casting about for some stronghold where he might make a desperate stand for the liberties of his country , his thoughts reverted to the mountain regions of his early campaigns . General Mercer was at hand , who had shared his perils among those mountains , and his presence may have contributed to bring them to his mind . ‘ What think you . ’ said Washington , ‘ if we should retreat to the back parts of Pennsylvania , would the Pennsylvanians support us ? ’ ‘ If the lower counties give up , the back counties will do the same , ’ was the discouraging reply . ‘ We must then retire to Augusta County , in Virginia , ’ said Washington . ‘ Numbers will repair to us for safety , and we will try a predatory war . If overpowered , we must cross the Alleghanies . ’ Such was the indomitable spirit , rising under difficulties and buoyant in the darkest moment , that kept our tempest-tossed cause from foundering . ” — Irving 's Washington , II , 448 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 164 ]</span>“ To herd with North , or Bute , or Mansfield there , ” — Ed . 1786 .

But the cruel tyrant , man , ( Tyrant since the world began ) Soon abridged my little span . How shall I the wrong forget ! Over me he threw a net ; And I am his prisoner yet .

ON THE NEW AMERICAN FRIGATE ALLIANCE<span type="note_anchor">[ 169 ]</span>As Neptune traced the azure main That owned , so late , proud Britain 's reign , A floating pile approached his car , The scene of terror and of war . As nearer still the monarch drew ( Her starry flag displayed to view ) He asked a Triton of his train “ What flag was this that rode the main ? “ A ship of such a gallant mien “ This many a day I have not seen , “ To no mean power can she belong , “ So swift , so warlike , stout , and strong . “ See how she mounts the foaming wave — “ Where other ships would find a grave , “ Majestic , aweful , and serene , “ She sails the ocean , like its queen . ” — “ Great monarch of the hoary deep , “ Whose trident awes the waves to sleep , ( Replied a Triton of his train ) “ This ship , that stems the western main , “ To those new , rising States belongs , “ Who , in resentment of their wrongs , “ Oppose proud Britain 's tyrant sway , “ And combat her , by land and sea . “ This pile , of such superior fame , “ From their strict union takes her name , “ For them she cleaves the briny tide , “ While terror marches by her side . “ When she unfurls her flowing sails , “ Undaunted by the fiercest gales , “ In dreadful pomp , she ploughs the main , “ While adverse tempests rage in vain . “ When she displays her gloomy tier , “ The boldest foes congeal with fear , “ And , owning her superior might , “ Seek their best safety in their flight . “ But when she pours the dreadful blaze , “ And thunder from her cannon plays , “ The bursting flash that wings the ball , “ Compells those foes to strike , or fall . “ Though she , with her triumphant crew , “ Might to their fate all foes pursue , “ Yet , faithful to the land that bore , “ She stays , to guard her native shore . “ Though she might make the cruisers groan “ That sail within the torrid zone , “ She kindly lends a nearer aid , “ Annoys them here , and guards the trade . “ Now , traversing the eastern main , “ She greets the shores of France and Spain ; “ Her gallant flag , displayed to view , “ Invites the old world to the new . “ This task atchieved , behold her go “ To seas congealed with ice and snow , “ To either tropic , and the line , “ Where suns with endless fervour shine . “ Not , Argo , on thy decks were found “ Such hearts of brass , as here abound ; “ They for their golden fleece did fly , “ These sail — to vanquish tyranny . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 169 ]</span>“ Built up the River Merrimack at Salisbury , Massachusetts , she was first sailed in the spring of 1778 , soon after her being launched , and was then commanded by Capt . Landais , a Frenchman , who was preferred to the command as a compliment to his nation and the alliance made with us , a new people . ” “ As Philadelphians we are entitled to some preeminence for our connection with this peculiar frigate . After the close of the War of Independence , she was owned in our city and employed as a merchant ship . When no longer seaworthy , she has been stretched upon the margin of Petty 's Island to remain for a century to come , a spectacle to many river passengers . ” — Watson 's Annals , III , 338 . The Alliance was the only one of our first navy , of the class of frigates , which escaped capture or destruction during the war . She was during the Revolution what “ Old Ironsides ” became in later years , the idol of the American people . She was in many engagements and was always victorious . Freneau 's poem first appeared , as far as I can find , in the 1786 edition . It was probably written shortly after the launch of the frigate . ON THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN NICHOLAS BIDDLE<span type="note_anchor">[ 170 ]</span>Commander of the Randolph Frigate , Blown up near Barbadoes , 1776 What distant thunders rend the skies , What clouds of smoke in columns rise , What means this dreadful roar ? Is from his base Vesuvius thrown , Is sky-topt Atlas tumbled down , Or Etna 's self no more ! Shock after shock torments my ear ; And lo !— two hostile ships appear , Red lightnings round them glow : The Yarmouth boasts of sixty-four , The Randolph thirty-two — no more — And will she fight this foe ! The Randolph soon on Stygian streams Shall coast along the land of dreams , The islands of the dead ! But Fate , that parts them on the deep , May save the Briton yet to weep His days of victory fled .<span type="note_anchor">[ 171 ]</span>Say , who commands that dismal blaze , Where yonder starry streamer plays ? Does Mars with Jove engage ! ‘ Tis Biddle wings those angry fires , Biddle , whose bosom Jove inspires , With more than mortal rage . Tremendous flash !— and hark , the ball Drives through old Yarmouth , flames and all ; Her bravest sons expire ; Did Mars himself approach so nigh , Even Mars , without disgrace , might fly The Randolph 's fiercer fire . The Briton views his mangled crew , “ And shall we strike to thirty-two ?— ( Said Hector , stained with gore ) “ Shall Britain 's flag to these descend — “ Rise , and the glorious conflict end , “ Britons , I ask no more ! ” He spoke — they charged their cannon round , Again the vaulted heavens resound , The Randolph bore it all , Then fixed her pointed cannons true — Away the unwieldy vengeance flew ; Britain , thy warriors fall . The Yarmouth saw , with dire dismay , Her wounded hull , shrouds shot away , Her boldest heroes dead — She saw amidst her floating slain The conquering Randolph stem the main — She saw , she turned — and fled ! That hour , blest chief , had she been thine , Dear Biddle , had the powers divine Been kind as thou wert brave ; But Fate , who doomed thee to expire , Prepared an arrow , tipt with fire , And marked a watery grave . And in that hour , when conquest came , Winged at his ship a pointed flame , That not even he could shun — The battle ceased , the Yarmouth fled , The bursting Randolph ruin spread , And left her task undone !<span type="note_anchor">[ 172 ]</span><span type="note_anchor">[ 170 ]</span>This poem was first published as a pamphlet in 1781 , by Francis Bailey of Philadelphia , in connection with “ The Prison Ship . ” Nicholas Biddle , born in Philadelphia in 1750 , was a sailor from his boyhood . At one time he served beside Nelson in the British navy . In 1776 , when the new frigate Randolph , of thirty-two guns , was launched at Philadelphia , he was made commander , and after several unimportant cruises he was placed over a small fleet of war vessels , with the Randolph as flagship . In March , 1779 , he fell in with the British ship Yarmouth , and after a vigorous action of twenty minutes , the Randolph was blown up by her own magazine , only four men escaping with their lives . Freneau has made several minor errors . The date 1776 , which is found on all the versions of the poem , should manifestly be 1779 . The Yarmouth did not attempt flight , nor did Biddle die at the moment of victory , as the poet represents . In the words of Cooper , “ Victory was almost hopeless , even had all his vessels behaved equally well with his own ship . ” Captain Vincent had only five men killed and twelve wounded at the time of the explosion , yet the gallantry and skill of Biddle in the face of great odds justify all the praise that Freneau gives him .<span type="note_anchor">[ 171 ]</span>“ His ancient honours fled . ” — Ed . 1786 .

CAPTAIN JONES 'S INVITATION<span type="note_anchor">[ 173 ]</span>Thou , who on some dark mountain 's brow Hast toil 'd thy life away till now , And often from that rugged steep Beheld the vast extended deep , Come from thy forest , and with me Learn what it is to go to sea . There endless plains the eye surveys As far from land the vessel strays ; No longer hill nor dale is seen , The realms of death intrude between , But fear no ill ; resolve , with me To share the dangers of the sea . But look not there for verdant fields — Far different prospects Neptune yields ; Green seas shall only greet the eye , Those seas encircled by the sky . Immense and deep — come then with me And view the wonders of the sea . Yet sometimes groves and meadows gay Delight the seamen on their way ; From the deep seas that round us swell With rocks the surges to repel Some verdant isle , by waves embrac 'd , Swells , to adorn the wat'ry waste . Though now this vast expanse appear With glassy surface , calm and clear ; Be not deceiv 'd — ‘ tis but a show , For many a corpse is laid below — Even Britain 's lads — it cannot be — They were the masters of the sea ! Now combating upon the brine , Where ships in flaming squadrons join , At every blast the brave expire ‘ Midst clouds of smoke , and streams of fire ; But scorn all fear ; advance with me — ‘ Tis but the custom of the sea . Now we the peaceful wave divide , On broken surges now we ride , Now every eye dissolves with woe As on some lee-ward coast we go — Half lost , half buried in the main Hope scarcely beams on life again . Above us storms distract the sky , Beneath us depths unfathom 'd lie , Too near we see , a ghastly sight ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 174 ]</span>The realms of everlasting night , A wat'ry tomb of ocean green And only one frail plank between ! But winds must cease , and storms decay , Not always lasts the gloomy day , Again the skies are warm and clear , Again soft zephyrs fan the air , Again we find the long lost shore , The winds oppose our wish no more . If thou hast courage to despise The various changes of the skies , To disregard the ocean 's rage , Unmov 'd when hostile ships engage , Come from thy forest , and with me Learn what it is to go to sea .<span type="note_anchor">[ 173 ]</span>From the 1786 edition . In the 1795 edition the title was changed to “ The Invitation . ” Captain John Paul Jones sailed from Isle de Groaix , France , on his memorable cruise , August 14 , 1779 .

THE SEA VOYAGE<span type="note_anchor">[ 175 ]</span>From a gay island green and fair , With gentle blasts of southern air , Across the deep we held our way , Around our barque smooth waters played , No envious clouds obscur 'd the day , Serene came on the evening shade . Still farther to the north we drew , And Porto Rico 's mountains blue , Were just decaying on the eye , When from the main arose the sun ; Before his ray the shadows fly , As we before the breezes run . Now northward of the tropic pass 'd , The fickle skies grew black at last ; The ruffian winds began to roar , The sea obey 'd their tyrant force , And we , alas ! too far from shore , Must now forsake our destin 'd course . The studding sails at last to hand , The vent'rous captain gave command ; But scarcely to the task went they When a vast billow o'er us broke , And tore the sheets and tacks away , Nor could the booms sustain the stroke . Still vaster rose the angry main . The winds through every shroud complain ; The topsails we could spread no more , Though doubly reef 'd , the furious blast Away the fluttering canvas bore , And vow 'd destruction to the mast . When now the northern storm was quell 'd , A calm ensued — but ocean swell 'd Beyond the towering mountain 's height , Till from the south new winds arose ; Our sails we spread at dead of night , And fair , though fierce , the tempest blows . When morning rose , the skies were clear The gentle breezes warm and fair , Convey 'd us o'er the wat'ry road ; A ship o'ertook us on the way , Her thousand sails were spread abroad , And flutter 'd in the face of day . At length , through many a climate pass 'd , Caesaria 's hills we saw at last , And reach 'd the land of lovely dames ; My charming Caelia there I found , ‘ Tis she my warmest friendship claims , The fairest maid that treads the ground .<span type="note_anchor">[ 175 ]</span>Unique in the October number of the United States Magazine , 1779 . The poem doubtless describes the poet 's voyage home from the West Indies , in June and July , 1778 . END OF VOL . I</note>
