       <l n="1">The poems written in 1804 were not numerous ; and , with the exception of</l>
       <l n="2">‘ The Small Celandine ’ , the stanzas beginning “ I wandered lonely as a</l>

       <l n="4">than those of the two preceding , and the three following years .</l>
       <l n="5">Wordsworth 's poetical activity in 1804 is not recorded , however , in</l>

       <l n="8">the terrace walk of Lancrigg during that year ; while the ‘ Ode ,</l>
       <l n="9">Intimations of Immortality ’ was altered and added to , although it did</l>
       <l n="10">not receive its final form till 1806 . In the sixth book of ‘ The</l>

     <p>It is not easy to say what were the “ four lines composed as a part of the verses on the ‘ Highland Girl ’ ” which the Fenwick note tells us was “ the germ of this poem . ” They may be lines now incorporated in those ‘ To a Highland Girl ’ , vol . ii . p. 389 , or they may be lines in the present poem , which Wordsworth wrote at first for the ‘ Highland Girl ’ , but afterwards transferred to this one . They may have been the first four lines of the later poem . The two should be read consecutively , and compared .</p>
     <p>After Wordsworth 's death , a writer in the ‘ Daily News ’ , January 1859 — then understood to be Miss Harriet Martineau — wrote thus :</p>
     <p>“ In the ‘ Memoirs ’ , by the nephew of the poet , it is said that these verses refer to Mrs. Wordsworth ; but for half of Wordsworth 's life it was always understood that they referred to some other phantom which ‘ gleamed upon his sight ’ before Mary Hutchinson . ”</p>
     <p>This statement is much more than improbable ; it is , I think , disproved by the Fenwick note . They cannot refer to the “ Lucy ” of the Goslar poems ; and Wordsworth indicates , as plainly as he chose , to whom they actually do refer . Compare the Hon . Justice Coleridge 's account of a conversation with Wordsworth ( ‘ Memoirs ’ , vol . ii . p. 306 ) , in which the poet expressly said that the lines were written on his wife . The question was , however , set at rest in a conversation of Wordsworth with Henry Crabb Robinson , who wrote in his ‘ Diary ’ on</p>
     <p>“ May 12 ( 1842 ) .— Wordsworth said that the poems ‘ Our walk was far among the ancient trees ’ [ vol . ii . p. 167 ] , then ‘ She was a Phantom of delight , ’ [ B ] and finally the two sonnets ‘ To a Painter ’ , should be read in succession as exhibiting the different phases of his affection to his wife . ”</p>
     <p>( ‘ Diary , Reminiscences , and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson ’ , vol . iii . p . 197 . )</p>
     <p>The use of the word “ machine , ” in the third stanza of the poem , has been much criticised , but for a similar use of the term , see the sequel to ‘ The Waggoner ’ ( p. 107 ):</p>

       <l n="17">Thursday , April 15 , 1802 :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park , we saw a few daffodils close to the water side . We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore , and that the little colony had so sprung up . But as we went along there were more , and yet more ; and , at last , under the boughs of the trees , we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore , about the breadth of a country turnpike road . I never saw daffodils so beautiful . They grew among the mossy stones , about and above them ; some rested their heads upon these stones , as on a pillow for weariness ; and the rest tossed and reeled and danced , and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake . They looked so gay , ever glancing , ever changing . This wind blew directly over the lake to them . There was here and there a little knot , and a few stragglers higher up ; but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity , unity , and life of that one busy highway . We rested again and again . The bays were stormy , and we heard the waves at different distances , and in the middle of the water , like the sea .... ”</p>
     <p>In the edition of 1815 there is a footnote to the lines</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ They flash upon that inward eye</l>

       <l n="3">to the following effect :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The subject of these Stanzas is rather an elementary feeling and simple impression ( approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum ) upon the imaginative faculty , than an exertion of it . The one which follows [ A ] is strictly a Reverie ; and neither that , nor the next after it in succession , ‘ Power of Music ’ , would have been placed here except for the reason given in the foregoing note . ”</p>
     <p>The being “ placed here ” refers to its being included among the “ Poems of the Imagination . ” The “ foregoing note ” is the note appended to ‘ The Horn of Egremont Castle ’ ; and the “ reason given ” in it is “ to avoid a needless multiplication of the Classes ” into which Wordsworth divided his poems . This note of 181 ? [ B ] , is reprinted mainly to show the difficulties to which Wordsworth was reduced by the artificial method of arrangement referred to . The following letter to Mr. Wrangham is a more appropriate illustration of the poem of “ The Daffodils . ” It was written , the late Bishop of Lincoln says , “ sometime afterwards . ” ( See ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ , vol . i. pp . 183 , 184 ) ; and , for the whole of the letter , see a subsequent volume of this edition .</p>
     <p>“ GRASMERE , Nov. 4 .</p>
     <p>“ MY DEAR WRANGHAM ,— I am indeed much pleased that Mrs. Wrangham and yourself have been gratified by these breathings of simple nature . You mention Butler , Montagu 's friend ; not Tom Butler , but the conveyancer : when I was in town in spring , he happened to see the volumes lying on Montagu 's mantelpiece , and to glance his eye upon the very poem of ‘ The Daffodils . ’ ‘ Aye , ’ says he , ‘ a fine morsel this for the Reviewers . ’ When this was told me ( for I was not present ) I observed that there were ‘ two lines ’ in that little poem which , if thoroughly felt , would annihilate nine-tenths of the reviews of the kingdom , as they would find no readers . The lines I alluded to were these :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ They flash upon that inward eye</l>
       <l n="2">Which is the bliss of solitude . ’ ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>These two lines were composed by Mrs. Wordsworth . In 1877 the daffodils were still growing in abundance on the shore of Ullswater , below Gowbarrow Park .</p>

      <head>THE FORSAKEN</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1804 .— Published 1842</l>
     </lg>
     <note>This was an overflow from ‘ The Affliction of Margaret ’ , and was excluded as superfluous there , but preserved in the faint hope that it may turn to account by restoring a shy lover to some forsaken damsel . My poetry has been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort ,— a charge which the piece beginning , “ Lyre ! though such power do in thy magic live , ” will scarcely tend to obviate . The natural imagery of these verses was supplied by frequent , I might say intense , observation of the Rydal torrent . What an animating contrast is the ever-changing aspect of that , and indeed of every one of our mountain brooks , to the monotonous tone and unmitigated fury of such streams among the Alps as are fed all the summer long by glaciers and melting snows . A traveller observing the exquisite purity of the great rivers , such as the Rhone at Geneva , and the Reuss at Lucerne , when they issue out of their respective lakes , might fancy for a moment that some power in nature produced this beautiful change , with a view to make amends for those Alpine sullyings which the waters exhibit near their fountain heads ; but , alas ! how soon does that purity depart before the influx of tributary waters that have flowed through cultivated plains and the crowded abodes of men .— I .

       <l n="3">— Hast thou then survived —</l>
       <l n="4">Mild Offspring of infirm humanity ,</l>
       <l n="5">Meek Infant ! among all forlornest things</l>
       <l n="6">The most forlorn — one life of that bright star ,</l>
       <l n="7">The second glory of the Heavens ?— Thou hast ; 5</l>
       <l n="8">Already hast survived that great decay ,</l>
       <l n="9">That transformation through the wide earth felt ,</l>
       <l n="10">And by all nations . In that Being 's sight</l>
       <l n="11">From whom the Race of human kind proceed ,</l>
       <l n="12">A thousand years are but as yesterday ; 10</l>
       <l n="13">And one day 's narrow circuit is to Him</l>
       <l n="14">Not less capacious than a thousand years .</l>
       <l n="15">But what is time ? What outward glory ? neither</l>
       <l n="16">A measure is of Thee , whose claims extend</l>
       <l n="17">Through “ heaven 's eternal year . ” [ B ] — Yet hail to Thee , 15</l>
       <l n="18">Frail , feeble , Monthling !— by that name , methinks ,</l>
       <l n="19">Thy scanty breathing-time is portioned out</l>
       <l n="20">Not idly .— Hadst thou been of Indian birth ,</l>
       <l n="21">Couched on a casual bed of moss and leaves ,</l>
       <l n="22">And rudely canopied by leafy boughs , 20</l>
       <l n="23">Or to the churlish elements exposed</l>
       <l n="24">On the blank plains ,— the coldness of the night ,</l>
       <l n="25">Or the night 's darkness , or its cheerful face</l>
       <l n="26">Of beauty , by the changing moon adorned ,</l>
       <l n="27">Would , with imperious admonition , then 25</l>
       <l n="28">Have scored thine age , and punctually timed</l>
       <l n="29">Thine infant history , on the minds of those</l>
       <l n="30">Who might have wandered with thee .— Mother 's love ,</l>
       <l n="31">Nor less than mother 's love in other breasts ,</l>
       <l n="32">Will , among us warm-clad and warmly housed , 30</l>
       <l n="33">Do for thee what the finger of the heavens</l>
       <l n="34">Doth all too often harshly execute</l>
       <l n="35">For thy unblest coevals , amid wilds</l>
       <l n="36">Where fancy hath small liberty to grace</l>
       <l n="37">The affections , to exalt them or refine ; 35</l>
       <l n="38">And the maternal sympathy itself ,</l>
       <l n="39">Though strong , is , in the main , a joyless tie</l>
       <l n="40">Of naked instinct , wound about the heart .</l>
       <l n="41">Happier , far happier is thy lot and ours !</l>
       <l n="42">Even now — to solemnise thy helpless state , 40</l>
       <l n="43">And to enliven in the mind 's regard</l>
       <l n="44">Thy passive beauty — parallels have risen ,</l>
       <l n="45">Resemblances , or contrasts , that connect ,</l>
       <l n="46">Within the region of a father 's thoughts ,</l>
       <l n="47">Thee and thy mate and sister of the sky . 45</l>
       <l n="48">And first ;— thy sinless progress , through a world</l>
       <l n="49">By sorrow darkened and by care disturbed ,</l>
       <l n="50">Apt likeness bears to hers , through gathered clouds ,</l>
       <l n="51">Moving untouched in silver purity ,</l>
       <l n="52">And cheering oft-times their reluctant gloom . 50</l>
       <l n="53">Fair are ye both , and both are free from stain :</l>
       <l n="54">But thou , how leisurely thou fill'st thy horn</l>
       <l n="55">With brightness ! leaving her to post along ,</l>
       <l n="56">And range about , disquieted in change ,</l>
       <l n="57">And still impatient of the shape she wears . 55</l>
       <l n="58">Once up , once down the hill , one journey , Babe</l>
       <l n="59">That will suffice thee ; and it seems that now</l>
       <l n="60">Thou hast fore-knowledge that such task is thine ;</l>
       <l n="61">Thou travellest so contentedly , and sleep'st</l>
       <l n="62">In such a heedless peace . Alas ! full soon 60</l>
       <l n="63">Hath this conception , grateful to behold ,</l>
       <l n="64">Changed countenance , like an object sullied o'er</l>
       <l n="65">By breathing mist ; and thine appears to be</l>
       <l n="66">A mournful labour , while to her is given</l>
       <l n="67">Hope , and a renovation without end . 65</l>
       <l n="68">— That smile forbids the thought ; for on thy face</l>
       <l n="69">Smiles are beginning , like the beams of dawn ,</l>
       <l n="70">To shoot and circulate ; smiles have there been seen ;</l>
       <l n="71">Tranquil assurances that Heaven supports</l>
       <l n="72">The feeble motions of thy life , and cheers 70</l>
       <l n="73">Thy loneliness : or shall those smiles be called</l>
       <l n="74">Feelers of love , put forth as if to explore</l>
       <l n="75">This untried world , and to prepare thy way</l>
       <l n="76">Through a strait passage intricate and dim ?</l>
       <l n="77">Such are they ; and the same are tokens , signs , 75</l>
       <l n="78">Which , when the appointed season hath arrived ,</l>
       <l n="79">Joy , as her holiest language , shall adopt ;</l>
       <l n="80">And Reason 's godlike Power be proud to own .</l>

It is remarkable that this flower coming out so early in the spring as it does , and so bright and beautiful , and in such profusion , should not have been noticed earlier in English verse .

     <note>This was presented to me by Sir George Beaumont , with a view to the erection of a house upon it , for the sake of being near to Coleridge , then living , and likely to remain , at Greta Hall , near Keswick . The severe necessities that prevented this arose from his domestic situation . This little property , with a considerable addition that still leaves it very small , lies beautifully upon the banks of a rill that gurgles down the side of Skiddaw ; and the orchard and other parts of the grounds command a magnificent prospect of Derwent Water , the mountains of Borrowdale and Newlands . Not many years ago I gave the place to my daughter .— I . F .</note>

     <note>This Ode is on the model of Gray 's ‘ Ode to Adversity ’ , which is copied from Horace 's Ode to Fortune . Many and many a time have I been twitted by my wife and sister for having forgotten this dedication of myself to the stern law-giver .

       <l n="1">Composed 1805 .— Published 1807</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ The young man whose death gave occasion to this poem was named Charles Gough , and had come early in the spring to Patterdale for the sake of angling . While attempting to cross over Helvellyn to Grasmere he slipped from a steep part of the rock where the ice was not thawed , and perished . His body was discovered as described in this poem . Walter Scott heard of the accident , and both he and I , without either of us knowing that the other had taken up the subject , each wrote a poem in admiration of the dog 's fidelity . His contains a most beautiful stanza :</p>
     <p>“ How long did'st thou think that his silence was slumber ! When the wind waved his garment how oft did'st thou start ! ”</p>
     <p>I will add that the sentiment in the last four lines of the last stanza of my verses was uttered by a shepherd with such exactness , that a traveller , who afterwards reported his account in print , was induced to question the man whether he had read them , which he had not .— I . F .]</p>

     <p>Thomas Wilkinson — referred to in the notes to ‘ The Solitary Reaper ’ , vol . ii . pp . 399 , 400 , and the verses ‘ To the Spade of a Friend ’ , in vol . iv .— alludes to this incident at some length in his poem , ‘ Emont Vale ’ . Wilkinson attended the funeral of young Gough , and writes of the incident with feeling , but without inspiration . Gough perished early in April , and his body was not found till July 22nd , 1805 . A reference to his fate will be found in Lockhart 's ‘ Life of Scott ’ ( vol . ii . p. 274 ) ; also in a letter of Mr . Luff of Patterdale , to his wife , July 23rd , 1805 . Henry Crabb Robinson records ( see his ‘ Diary , Reminiscences ’ , etc ., vol . ii . p. 25 ) a conversation with Wordsworth , in which he said of this poem , that “ he purposely made the narrative as prosaic as possible , in order that no discredit might be thrown on the truth of the incident . ” — Ed .</p>

      <p>SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT</p>
       <l n="1">[ Sub-Footnote a : Many years ago Principal Shairp wrote to me ,</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Have you noted how the two lines , ‘ The light that never was , ’ etc ., stood in the edition of 1827 ? I know no other such instance of a change from commonplace to perfection of ideality . ”</p>
     <p>The Principal had not remembered at the time that the “ perfection of ideality ” was in the original edition of 1807 . The curious thing is that the prosaic version of 1820 and 1827 ever took its place . Wordsworth 's return to his original reading was one of the wisest changes he introduced into the text of 1832 .— Ed . ]</p>
     <p>There is a Peele Castle , on a small rocky island , close to the town of Peele , in the Isle of Man ; yet separated from it , much as St. Michael 's Mount in Cornwall is separated from the mainland . This castle was believed by many to be the one which Sir George painted , and which gave rise to the foregoing lines . I visited it in 1879 , being then ignorant that any other Peele Castle existed ; and although , the day being calm , and the season summer , I thought Sir George had idealized his subject much — ( as I had just left Coleorton , where the picture still exists ) — I accepted the customary opinion . But I am now convinced , both from the testimony of the Arnold family , [ B ] and as the result of a visit to Piel Castle , near Barrow in Furness , that Wordsworth refers to it . The late Bishop of Lincoln , in his uncle 's ‘ Memoirs ’ ( vol . i. p. 299 ) , quotes the line</p>
     <p>“ I was thy neighbour once , thou rugged pile , ”</p>
     <p>and adds ,</p>
     <p>“ He had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the house of his cousin , Mr. Barker . ”</p>
     <p>This house was at Rampside , the village opposite Piel , on the coast of Lancashire . The “ rugged pile , ” too , now “ cased in the unfeeling armour of old time , ” painted by Beaumont , is obviously this Piel Castle near Barrow . I took the engraving of his picture with me , when visiting it : and although Sir George — after the manner of landscape artists of his day — took many liberties with his subjects , it is apparent that it was this , and not Peele Castle in Mona , that he painted . The “ four summer weeks ” referred to in the first stanza , were those spent at Piel during the year 1794 .</p>
     <p>With the last verse of these ‘ Elegiac Stanzas ’ compare stanzas ten and eleven of the ‘ Ode , Intimations of Immortality ’ , vol . viii .</p>
     <p>One of the two pictures of “ Peele Castle in a Storm ” — engraved by S. W. Reynolds , and published in the editions of Wordsworth 's poems of 1815 and 1820 — is still in the Beaumont Gallery at Coleorton Hall .</p>
     <p>The poem is so memorable that I have arranged to make this picture of “ Peele Castle in a Storm , ” the vignette to vol . xv . of this edition . It deserves to be noted that it was to the pleading of Barron Field that we owe the restoration of the original line of 1807 ,</p>
     <p>‘ The light that never was , on sea or land . ’</p>
     <p>An interesting account of Piel Castle will be found in Hearne and Byrne 's ‘ Antiquities ’ . It was built by the Abbot of Furness in the first year of the reign of Edward III .— Ed .</p>
<note>Footnote B : Miss Arnold wrote to me , in December 1893 :</note>     <note xml:id="noteB_8" place="bottom" n="B">Miss Arnold wrote to me , in December 1893 :</note>
     <p>“ I have never doubted that the Peele Castle of Wordsworth is the Piel off Walney Island . I know that my brother Matthew so believed , and I went with him some years ago from Furness Abbey over to Piel , visiting it as the subject of the picture and the poem . ”</p>

     <p>“ Moss Campion ( ‘ Silene acaulis ’ ) . This most beautiful plant is scarce in England , though it is found in great abundance upon the mountains of Scotland . The first specimen I ever saw of it in its native bed was singularly fine , the tuft or cushion being at least eight inches diameter , and the root proportionably thick . I have only met with it in two places among our mountains , in both of which I have since sought for it in vain .</p>
     <p>Botanists will not , I hope , take it ill , if I caution them against carrying off inconsiderately rare and beautiful plants . This has often been done , particularly from Ingleborough and other mountains in Yorkshire , till the species have totally disappeared , to the great regret of lovers of nature living near the places where they grew . ” — W. W. 1842 .</p>

     <p>At a meeting of “ The Wordsworth Society ” held at Grasmere , in July 1881 , it was proposed by one of the members , the Rev . H. D. Rawnsley , then Vicar of Wray , to erect some memorial at the parting-place of the brothers . The brothers John and William Wordsworth parted at Grisedale Tarn , on the 29th September 1800 . The originator of the idea wrote thus of it in June 1882 :</p>
     <p>“ A proposition , made by one of its members to the Wordsworth Society when it met in Grasmere in 1881 , to mark the spot in the Grisedale Pass of Wordsworth 's parting from his brother John — and to carry out a wish the poet seems to have hinted at in the last of his elegiac verses in memory of that parting — is now being put into effect . It has been determined , after correspondence with Lord Coleridge , Dr. Cradock , Professor Knight , and Mr. Hills , to have inscribed — ( on the native rock , if possible ) — the first four lines of Stanzas III . and VII . of these verses :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Here did we stop ; and here looked round</l>
       <l n="2">While each into himself descends ,</l>
       <l n="3">For that last thought of parting Friends</l>
       <l n="4">That is not to be found .</l>
       <l n="5">...</l>
       <l n="6">Brother and friend , if verse of mine</l>
       <l n="7">Have power to make thy virtues known ,</l>
       <l n="8">Here let a monumental Stone</l>
       <l n="9">Stand — sacred as a Shrine . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The rock selected is a fine mass , facing the east , on the left of the track as one descends from Grisedale Tarn towards Patterdale , and is about 100 yards from the tarn . No more suitable one can be found , and we have the testimony of Mr. David Richardson of Newcastle , who has practical knowledge of engineering , that it is the fittest , both from shape and from slight incline of plane .</p>
     <p>It has been proposed to sink a panel in the face of the rock , that so the inscription may be slightly protected , and to engrave the letters upon the face of the panel thus obtained . But it is not quite certain yet that the grain of the rock — volcanic ash — will admit of the lettering . If this cannot be carried out , it has been determined to have the letters engraved upon a slab of Langdale slate , and imbed it in the Grisedale Rock .</p>
     <p>It is believed that the simplicity of the design , the lonely isolation of this mountain memorial , will appeal at once</p>
     <p>' ... to the few who pass this way , Traveller or Shepherd . ’</p>
     <p>And we in our turn appeal to English tourists who may chance to see it , to forego the wish of adding to it , or taking anything from it , by engraving their own names ; and to let the Monumental Stone stand , as the poet wished it might</p>
     <p>' ... stand , SACRED as a Shrine . ’</p>
     <p>We owe great thanks to Mrs. Sturge for first surveying the place , to ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently striking in position ; to Mr. Richardson , jun ., for his etching of the rock , upon which the inscription is to be made ; to his father for the kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock ; and particularly to the seconder of the original proposal , and my coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work , Mr. W. H. Hills .</p>
     <p>H. D. RAWNSLEY .</p>
     <p>P. S .— When we came to examine the rock , we found the area for the panel less than we had hoped for , owing to certain rock fissures , which , by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface , would have much interfered with the durability of the inscription . The available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7 in length by 1 foot 9 inches in depth . Owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone , it may be quite possible to letter the native rock ; but it has been difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that shall be at once in good taste , forcible , and plain . It was proposed that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the inscription cut on the rock , in the late Mr. Ball 's garden grounds below the Mount at Rydal , should be adopted ; but a final decision has been given in favour of a style of lettering which Mrs. Rawnsley has designed . The panel is , from its position , certain to attract the eye of the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass .</p>

     <p>The following extract from ‘ Recollections from 1803 to 1837 , with a Conclusion in 1868 , by the Hon . Amelia Murray ’ ( London : Longmans , Green , and Co. 1868 ) — refers to the loss of the ‘ Abergavenny ':</p>
     <p>“ One morning , coming down early , I saw what I thought was a great big ship without any hull . This was the ‘ Abergavenny ’ , East Indiaman , which had sunk with all sails set , hardly three miles from the shore , and all on board perished .</p>
     <p>Had any of the crew taken refuge in the main-top , they might have been saved ; but the bowsprit , which was crowded with human beings , gave a lurch into the sea as the ship settled down , and thus all were washed off — though the timber appeared again above water when the ‘ Abergavenny ’ touched the ground . The ship had sprung a leak off St. Alban 's Head ; and in spite of pumps , she went to the bottom just within reach of safety . ” Pp . 12 , 13 .</p>

     <p>For much in reference to John Wordsworth , which illustrates both these ‘ Elegiac Verses ’ , and the poem “ On the Naming of Places ” which follows them , I must refer to his ‘ Life ’ to be published in another volume of this series ; but there is one letter of Dorothy Wordsworth 's , written to her friend Miss Jane Pollard ( afterwards Mrs. Marshall ) , in reference to her brother 's death , which may find a place here . For the use of it I am indebted to the kindness of Mrs. Marshall 's daughter , the Dowager Lady Monteagle :</p>
     <p>“ March 16th , 1805 . Grasmere .</p>
     <p>“ ... It does me good to weep for him , and it does me good to find that others weep , and I bless them for it . ... It is with me , when I write , as when I am walking out in this vale , once so full of joy . I can turn to no object that does not remind me of our loss . I see nothing that he would not have loved , and enjoyed .... My consolations rather come to me in gusts of feeling , than are the quiet growth of my mind . I know it will not always be so . The time will come when the light of the setting sun upon these mountain tops will be as heretofore a pure joy ; not the same gladness , that can never be — but yet a joy even more tender . It will soothe me to know how happy he would have been , could he have seen the same beautiful spectacle .... He was taken away in the freshness of his manhood ; pure he was , and innocent as a child . Never human being was more thoroughly modest , and his courage I need not speak of . He was ‘ seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the first mate a few minutes before the ship went down ; ’ and when nothing more could be done , He said , ‘ the will of God be done . ’ I have no doubt when he felt that it was out of his power to save his life he was as calm as before , if some thought of what we should endure did not awaken a pang .... He loved solitude , and he rejoiced in society . He would wander alone amongst these hills with his fishing-rod , or led on by the mere pleasure of walking , for many hours ; or he would walk with W. or me , or both of us , and was continually pointing out — with a gladness which is seldom seen but in very young people — something which perhaps would have escaped our observation ; for he had so fine an eye that no distinction was unnoticed by him , and so tender a feeling that he never noticed anything in vain . Many a time has he called out to me at evening to look at the moon or stars , or a cloudy sky , or this vale in the quiet moonlight ; but the stars and moon were his chief delight . He made of them his companions when he was at sea , and was never tired of those thoughts which the silence of the night fed in him . Then he was so happy by the fireside . Any little business of the house interested him . He loved our cottage . He helped us to furnish it , and to make the garden . Trees are growing now which he planted .... He staid with us till the 29th of September , having come to us about the end of January . During that time Mary Hutchinson — now Mary Wordsworth — staid with us six weeks . John used to walk with her everywhere , and they were exceedingly attached to each other ; so my poor sister mourns with us , not merely because we have lost one who was so dear to William and me , but from tender love to John and an intimate knowledge of him . Her hopes as well as ours were fixed on John .... I can think of nothing but of our departed Brother , yet I am very tranquil to-day . I honour him , and love him , and glory in his memory .... ”</p>
     <p>Southey , writing to his friend , C. W. W. Wynn , on the 3rd of April 1805 , says :</p>

      <head>“ DEAR WYNN ,</head>
      <head>I have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the ‘ Abergavenny ’ , of which Wordsworth 's brother was captain . Of course the news came flying up to us from all quarters , and it has disordered me from head to foot . At such circumstances I believe we feel as much for others as for ourselves ; just as a violent blow occasions the same pain as a wound , and he who breaks his shin feels as acutely at the moment as the man whose leg is shot off . In fact , I am writing to you merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to do anything else . It is the heaviest calamity Wordsworth has ever experienced , and in all probability I shall have to communicate it to him , as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him . What renders any near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is , that the recollection is perpetually freshened when any like event occurs , by the mere mention of shipwreck , or the sound of the wind . Of all deaths it is the most dreadful , from the circumstances of terror which accompany it .... ”</head>

      <head>I wished to tell you that you would one day feel the kind of peaceful state of mind and sweet memory of the dead , which you so happily describe , as now almost begun ; but I felt that it was improper , and most grating to the feelings of the afflicted , to say to them that the memory of their affliction would in time become a constant part , not only of their dreams , but of their most wakeful sense of happiness . That you would see every object with and through your lost brother , and that that would at last become a real and everlasting source of comfort to you , I felt , and well knew , from my own experience in sorrow ; but till you yourself began to feel this , I did not dare to tell you so ; but I send you some poor lines , which I wrote under this conviction of mind , and before I heard Coleridge was returning home .</head>

       <l n="5">In deepest winter ; and , from week to week , 5</l>
       <l n="6">Pathway , and lane , and public road , were clogged</l>
       <l n="7">With frequent showers of snow . Upon a hill</l>
       <l n="8">At a short distance from my cottage , stands</l>
       <l n="9">A stately Fir-grove , whither I was wont</l>
       <l n="10">To hasten , for I found , beneath the roof 10</l>

       <l n="18">Hither repaired .— A single beech-tree grew</l>
       <l n="19">Within this grove of firs ! and , on the fork</l>
       <l n="20">Of that one beech , appeared a thrush 's nest ; 20</l>
       <l n="21">A last year 's nest , conspicuously built</l>

       <l n="27">A few sheep , stragglers from some mountain-flock ,</l>

     <p>SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT</p>
     <note>Sub-Footnote a : In the late Lord Coleridge 's copy of the edition of 1836 , there is a footnote in Wordsworth 's handwriting to the word “ meanwhile ” which is substituted for “ newly . ” “ If ‘ newly ’ come , could he have traced a visible path ? ” — Ed .</note>
     <p>This wish was not granted ; the lamented Person , not long after , perished by shipwreck , in discharge of his duty as Commander of the Honourable East India Company 's Vessel , the ‘ Earl of Abergavenny ’ .— W . W. 1815 .</p>
     <p>For the date of this poem in the Chronological Tables given in the editions of 1815 and 1820 , Wordsworth assigned the year 1802 . But , in the edition of 1836 , he assigned it to the year 1805 , the date retained by Mr. Carter in the edition of 1857 . Captain Wordsworth perished on the 5th of February 1805 ; and if the poem was written in 1805 , it must have been in the month of January of that year . The note to the poem is explicit — “ Not long after ” he “ perished by shipwreck , ” etc . Thus the poem may have been written in the beginning of 1805 ; but it is not at all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year . John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the Town-end Cottage , Grasmere , during part of the winter , and during the whole of the spring , summer , and autumn of 1800 , William and John going together on foot into Yorkshire from the 14th of May to the 7th of June . John left Grasmere on Michaelmas day ( September 29th ) 1800 , and never returned to it again . The following is Miss Wordsworth 's record of that day in her Journal of 1800 :</p>
     <p>“ On Monday , 29th , John left us . William and I parted with him in sight of Ullswater . It was a fine day , showery , but with sunshine and fine clouds . Poor fellow , my heart was right sad , I could not help thinking we should see him again , because he was only going to Penrith . ”</p>
     <p>In the spring of 1801 , John Wordsworth sailed for China in the ‘ Abergavenny ’ . He returned from this voyage in safety , and the brothers met once again in London . He went to sea again in 1803 , and returned to London in 1804 , but could not visit Grasmere ; and in the month of February 1805 — shortly after he was appointed to the command of the ‘ Abergavenny ’ — the ship was lost at the Bill of Portland , and every one on board perished . It is clear that the latter part of the poem , “ When , to the attractions of the busy world , ” was written between John Wordsworth 's departure from Grasmere and the loss of the ‘ Abergavenny ’ , i. e. between September 1800 and February 1805 , as there are references in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to his return to sea :</p>
     <p>‘ Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone . ’</p>
     <p>There are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to negative the idea of its having been written in 1800 . The opening lines seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant . He speaks of being “ wont ” to do certain things . But , on the other hand , I find an entry in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , which leads me to believe that the poem may have been begun in 1800 , and that the first part , ending ( as it did then ) with the line :</p>
     <p>‘ While she is travelling through the dreary sea , ’</p>
     <p>may have been finished before John Wordsworth left Grasmere ; the second part being written afterwards , while he was at sea ; and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions of 1815 and 1820 , viz . 1802 .</p>
     <p>Passages occur in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal to the following effect :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Monday Morning , 1st September .— We walked in the wood by the lake .</l>
       <l n="2">William read ‘ Joanna ’ and ‘ the Firgrove ’ to Coleridge . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">A little earlier there is the record ,</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Saturday , 22nd August .— William was composing all the morning .... William read us the poem of ‘ Joanna ’ beside the Rothay by the roadside . ”</p>
     <p>Then , on Friday , the 25th August , there is the entry ,</p>
     <p>“ We walked over the hill by the Firgrove , I sate upon a rock and observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head . We walked through the wood to the stepping stones , the lake of Rydale very beautiful , partly still , I left William to compose an inscription , that about the path .... ”</p>
     <p>Then , next day ,</p>
     <p>“ Saturday morning , 30th August .— William finished his inscription of the Pathway , then walked in the wood , and when John returned he sought him , and they bathed together . ”</p>
     <p>To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred under the name of the “ Inscription of the Pathway ” has puzzled me much . There is no poem amongst his “ Inscriptions ” ( written in or before August 1800 ) that corresponds to it in the least . But , if my conjecture is right that this “ Poem on the Naming of Places , ” beginning :</p>
     <p>‘ When , to the attractions of the busy world , ’</p>
     <p>was composed at two different times , it is quite possible that “ the Firgrove ” which was read — along with ‘ Joanna ’ — to Coleridge on September 1st , 1800 , was the first part of this very poem .</p>
     <p>If this supposition is correct , some light is cast both on the “ Inscription of the Pathway . ” and on the date assigned by Wordsworth himself to the poem . There is a certain fitness , however , in this poem being placed — as it now is — in sequence to the ‘ Elegiac Verses ’ in memory of John Wordsworth , beginning , “ The Sheep-boy whistled loud , ” and near the fourth poem ‘ To the Daisy ’ , beginning , “ Sweet Flower ! belike one day to have . ”</p>
     <p>The “ Fir-grove ” still exists . It is between Wishing Gate and White Moss Common , and almost exactly opposite the former . Standing at the gate and looking eastwards , the grove is to the left , not forty yards distant . Some of the firs ( Scotch ones ) still survive , and several beech trees , not “ a single beech-tree , ” as in the poem . From this , one might infer that the present colony had sprung up since the beginning of the century , and that the special tree , in which was the thrush 's nest , had perished ; but Dr. Cradock wrote to me that “ Wordsworth pointed out the tree to Miss Cookson a few days before Dora Wordsworth 's death . The tree is near the upper wall and tells its own tale . ” The Fir-grove — “ John 's Grove ” — can easily be entered by a gate about a hundred yards beyond the Wishing-gate , as one goes toward Rydal . The view from it , the “ visionary scene , ”</p>
     <p>‘ the spectacle Of clouded splendour , ... this dream-like sight Of solemn loveliness , ’</p>
     <p>is now much interfered with by the new larch plantations immediately below the firs . It must have been very different in Wordsworth 's time , and is constantly referred to in his sister 's Journal as a favourite retreat , resorted to</p>
     <p>‘ when cloudless suns Shone hot , or wind blew troublesome and strong . ’</p>
     <p>In the absence of contrary testimony , it might be supposed that “ the track ” which the brother had “ worn , ”</p>
     <p>‘ By pacing here , unwearied and alone , ’</p>
     <p>faced Silver-How and the Grasmere Island , and that the single beech tree was nearer the lower than the upper wall . But Miss Cookson 's testimony is explicit . Only a few fir trees survive at this part of the grove , which is now open and desolate , not as it was in those earlier days , when</p>

     <p>This poem underwent no change in successive editions . The title in all the earlier ones ( 1815 to 1843 ) was ‘ The Cottager to her Infant . By a Female Friend ’ ; and in the preface to the edition of 1815 , Wordsworth wrote ,</p>
     <p>“ Three short pieces ( now first published ) are the work of a Female Friend ; ... if any one regard them with dislike , or be disposed to condemn them , let the censure fall upon him , who , trusting in his own sense of their merit , and their fitness for the place which they occupy , extorted them from the Authoress . ”</p>

      <head>When I sent you , a few weeks ago , the Tale of ‘ Peter Bell ’ , you asked “ why THE WAGGONER was not added ? ” — To say the truth ,— from the higher tone of imagination , and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the former , I apprehended , this little Piece could not accompany it without disadvantage . In the year 1806 , if I am not mistaken , THE WAGGONER was read to you in manuscript ; and , as you have remembered it for so long a time , I am the more encouraged to hope , that , since the localities on which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you , it may prove acceptable to others . Being therefore in some measure the cause of its present appearance , you must allow me the gratification of inscribing it to you ; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have derived from your Writings , and of the high esteem with which I am Very truly yours , WILLIAM WORDSWORTH .</head>

     <p>I</p>
     <p>Several years after the event that forms the subject of the foregoing poem , in company with my friend , the late Mr. Coleridge , I happened to fall in with the person to whom the name of Benjamin is given . Upon our expressing regret that we had not , for a long time , seen upon the road either him or his waggon , he said :— “ They could not do without me ; and as to the man who was put in my place , no good could come out of him ; he was a man of no ideas . ”</p>
     <p>The fact of my discarded hero 's getting the horses out of a great difficulty with a word , as related in the poem , was told me by an eye-witness .</p>

     <p>ROCK OF NAMES ! Light is the strain , but not unjust To Thee and thy memorial-trust , That once seemed only to express Love that was love in idleness ; Tokens , as year hath followed year , How changed , alas , in character ! For they were graven on thy smooth breast By hands of those my soul loved best ; Meek women , men as true and brave As ever went to a hopeful grave : Their hands and mine , when side by side With kindred zeal and mutual pride , We worked until the Initials took Shapes that defied a scornful look .— Long as for us a genial feeling Survives , or one in need of healing , The power , dear Rock , around thee cast , Thy monumental power , shall last For me and mine ! O thought of pain , That would impair it or profane ! Take all in kindness then , as said With a staid heart but playful head ; And fail not Thou , loved Rock ! to keep Thy charge when we are laid asleep .</p>
     <p>W. W .</p>
     <p>There is no poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of the English Lakes — and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick — than ‘ The Waggoner ’ is , and in none are the topographical allusions more minute and faithful .</p>
     <p>Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what “ class ” of his poems to place ‘ The Waggoner ; ’ and his frequent changes — removing it from one group to another — shew the artificial character of these classes . Thus , in the edition of 1820 , it stood first among the “ Poems of the Fancy . ” In 1827 it was the last of the “ Poems founded on the Affections . ” In 1832 it was reinstated among the “ Poems of the Fancy . ” In 1836 it had a place of its own , and was inserted between the “ Poems of the Fancy ” and those “ Founded on the Affections ; ” while in 1845 it was sent back to its original place among the “ Poems of the Fancy ; ” although in the table of contents it was printed as an independent poem , closing the series .</p>
     <p>The original text of ‘ The Waggoner ’ underwent little change , till the year 1836 , when it was carefully revised , and altered throughout . The final edition of 1845 , however , reverted , in many instances — especially in the first canto — to the original text of 1819 .</p>
     <p>As this poem was dedicated to Charles Lamb , it may be of interest to note that , some six months afterwards , Lamb presented Wordsworth with a copy of the first edition of ‘ Paradise Regained ’ ( the edition of 1671 ) , writing on it the following sentence ,</p>
     <p>“ Charles Lamb , to the best knower of Milton , and therefore the worthiest occupant of this pleasant edition .— Jan . 2nd , 1820 . ”</p>
     <p>The opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry June evening , with a thunder-storm imminent .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">' ‘ Tis spent — this burning day of June !</l>
       <l n="2">Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing ;</l>
       <l n="3">The buzzing dor-hawk , round and round , is wheeling ,—</l>
       <l n="4">That solitary bird</l>
       <l n="5">Is all that can be heard</l>
       <l n="6">In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon !</l>
       <l n="7">...</l>
       <l n="8">...</l>
       <l n="9">The mountains against heaven 's grave weight</l>
       <l n="10">Rise up , and grow to wondrous height .</l>
       <l n="11">The air , as in a lion 's den ,</l>
       <l n="12">Is close and hot ;— and now and then</l>
       <l n="13">Comes a tired and sultry breeze</l>
       <l n="14">With a haunting and a panting ,</l>
       <l n="15">Like the stifling of disease ;</l>
       <l n="16">But the dews allay the heat ,</l>
       <l n="17">And the silence makes it sweet . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The Waggoner takes what is now the middle road , of the three leading from Rydal to Grasmere ( see the note to ‘ The Primrose of the Rock ’ ) . The “ craggy hill ” referred to in the lines</p>
     <p>‘ Now he leaves the lower ground , And up the craggy hill ascending ... Steep the way and wearisome , ’</p>
     <p>is the road from Rydal Quarry up to White Moss Common , with the Glowworm rock on the right , and the “ two heath-clad rocks , ” referred to in the last of the “ Poems on the Naming of Places , ” on the left . He next passes “ The Wishing Gate ” on the left , John 's Grove on the right , and descends by Dove Cottage — where Wordsworth lived — to Grasmere .</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">‘ He knows it to his cost , good Man !</l>
       <l n="12">Who does not know the famous SWAN ?</l>
       <l n="13">Object uncouth ! and yet our boast ,</l>
       <l n="14">For it was painted by the Host ;</l>
       <l n="15">His own conceit the figure planned ,</l>
       <l n="16">‘ Twas coloured all by his own hand . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>As early as 1819 , when the poem was first published , “ this rude piece of self-taught art had been supplanted ” by a more pretentious figure . The Waggoner passes the Swan ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ And now the conqueror essays</l>
       <l n="2">The long ascent of Dunmail-raise . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>As he proceeds , the storm gathers , and “ struggles to get free . ” Road , hill , and sky are dark ; and he barely sees the well-known rocks at the summit of Helm-crag , where two figures seem to sit , like those on the Cobbler , near Arrochar , in Argyle .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Black is the sky — and every hill ,</l>
       <l n="2">Up to the sky , is blacker still —</l>
       <l n="3">Sky , hill , and dale , one dismal room ,</l>
       <l n="4">Hung round and overhung with gloom ;</l>
       <l n="5">Save that above a single height</l>
       <l n="6">Is to be seen a lurid light ,</l>
       <l n="7">Above Helm-crag — a streak half dead ,</l>
       <l n="8">A burning of portentous red ;</l>
       <l n="9">And near that lurid light , full well</l>
       <l n="10">The ASTROLOGER , sage Sidrophel ,</l>
       <l n="11">Where at his desk and book he sits ,</l>
       <l n="12">Puzzling aloft his curious wits ;</l>
       <l n="13">He whose domain is held in common</l>
       <l n="14">With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN ,</l>
       <l n="15">Cowering beside her rifted cell ,</l>
       <l n="16">As if intent on magic spell ;—</l>
       <l n="17">Dread pair , that , spite of wind and weather ,</l>
       <l n="18">Still sit upon Helm-crag together ! ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>At the top of the “ raise ” — the water-shed between the vales of Grasmere and Wytheburn — he reaches the familiar pile of stones , at the boundary between the shires of Westmoreland and Cumberland .</p>
     <p>‘ ... that pile of stones , Heaped over brave King Dunmail 's bones ; ... Green is the grass for beast to graze , Around the stones of Dunmail-raise ! ’</p>
     <p>The allusion to Seat-Sandal laid bare by the flash of lightning , and the description , in the last canto , of the ascent of the Raise by the Waggoner on a summer morning , are as true to the spirit of the place as anything that Wordsworth has written . He tells his friend Lamb , fourteen years after he wrote the poem of ‘ The Waggoner , ’</p>

       <l n="7">Rock of Names .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>This rock was , until lately , one of the most interesting memorials of Wordsworth and his friends that survived in the Lake District ; but the vale of Thirlmere is now a Manchester water-tank , and the place which knew the Rock of Names now knows it no more . It was a sort of trysting place of the poets of Grasmere and Keswick — being nearly half-way between the two places — and there , Wordsworth , Coleridge , and other members of their households often met . When Coleridge left Grasmere for Keswick , the Wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock ; and they often met him there on his way over from Keswick to Grasmere . Compare the Hon . Mr. Justice Coleridge 's Reminiscences . ( ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth , ’ vol . ii . p . 310 . )</p>
     <p>The rock was on the right hand of the road , a little way past Waterhead , at the southern end of Thirlmere ; and on it were cut the letters ,</p>
     <p>W. W. M. H. D. W. S. T. C. J. W. S. H .</p>
     <p>the initials of William Wordsworth , Mary Hutchinson , Dorothy Wordsworth , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , John Wordsworth , and Sarah Hutchinson . The Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year 1799 . As mentioned in a previous note , John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister during most of that winter , and during the whole of the spring , summer , and autumn of 1800 , leaving it finally on September 29 , 1800 . These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of 1800 . There is no record of the occurrence , and no allusion to the rock , in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Grasmere Journal of 1800 . But that Journal , so far as I have seen it , begins on the 14th of May 1800 . Almost every detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so minutely recorded in it , that I am convinced that this incident of the cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned , had it happened between the 14th of May and John Wordsworth 's departure from Grasmere in September . Such references as this , for example , occur in the Journal :</p>
     <p>“ Saturday , August 2 .— William and Coleridge went to Keswick . John went with them to Wytheburn , and staid all day fishing . ”</p>
     <p>I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that the names were cut .</p>
     <p>I may add that the late Dean of Westminster — Dean Stanley — took much interest in this Rock of Names ; and doubt having been cast on the accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions , in a letter from Dr. Fraser , then Bishop of Manchester , which he forwarded to me , he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a Church .</p>
     <p>There were few memorials connected with Wordsworth more worthy of preservation than this “ upright mural block of stone . ” When one remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of William and John Wordsworth , by Samuel Taylor Coleridge , possibly with the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth , the two Hutchinsons ( Mary and Sarah ) , and that Wordsworth says of it ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ We worked until the Initials took</l>
       <l n="2">Shapes that defied a scornful look , ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the group of poets that used to meet beside it , than the Stone in the grounds of Rydal Mount , which was spared at Wordsworth 's suit , “ from some rude beauty of its own . ” There was simplicity , as well as strength , in the way in which the initials were cut . But the stone was afterwards desecrated by tourists , and others , who had the audacity to scratch their own names or initials upon it . In 1877 I wrote , “ The rock is as yet wonderfully free from such ; and its preservation is probably due to the dark olive-coloured moss , with which the ‘ pure water trickling down ’ has covered the face of the ‘ mural block , ’ and thus secured it from observation , even on that highway ; ” but I found in the summer of 1882 that several other names had been ruthlessly added . When the Manchester Thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon , an effort was made to remove the Stone , with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the side of the new roadway . In the course of this attempt , the Stone was broken to pieces .</p>

       <l n="14">Each peering forth to meet the other . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Raven-crag is well known ,— H. C. Robinson writes of it in his ‘ Diary ’ in 1818 , as “ the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is not one insignificant , ” — a rock on the western side of Thirlmere , where the Greta issues from the lake . But there is no rock in the district now called by the name of Ghimmer-crag , or the crag of the Ewe-lamb . I am inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the “ Fisher-crag ” of the Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books . No other rock round Thirlmere can with any accuracy be called the “ tall twin brother ” of Raven-crag : certainly not Great How , nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell . Fisher-crag resembles Raven-crag , as seen from Thirlmere Bridge , or from the high road above it ; and it is somewhat remarkable that Green — in his Guide to the Lakes ( a volume which the poet possessed ) — makes use of the same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two crags , Raven and Fisher .</p>
     <p>“ The margin of the lake on the Dalehead side has its charms of wood and water ; and Fischer Crag , twin brother to Raven Crag , is no bad object , when taken near the island called Buck 's Holm ”</p>
     <p>( ‘ A Description of Sixty Studies from Nature ’ , by William Green of Ambleside , 1810 , p. 57 ) . I cannot find any topographical allusion to a Ghimmer-crag in contemporary local writers . Clarke , in his ‘ Survey of the Lakes ’ , does not mention it .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The Castle Rock , in the Vale of Legberthwaite , between High Fell and</l>

       <l n="5">Threlkeld has long been in a state of ruinous dilapidation , the only</l>
       <l n="6">habitable part of it having been for many years converted into a</l>
       <l n="7">farmhouse . The remaining local allusions in ‘ The Waggoner ’ are obvious</l>
       <l n="8">enough : Castrigg is the shortened form of Castlerigg , the ridge between</l>
       <l n="9">Naddle Valley and Keswick .</l>

     <p>In the “ Reminiscences ” of Wordsworth , which the Hon . Mr. Justice Coleridge wrote for the late Bishop of Lincoln , in 1850 , there is the following reference to ‘ The Waggoner ’ . ( See ‘ Memoirs ’ , vol . ii . p . 310 . )</p>
     <p>“ ‘ The Waggoner ’ seems a very favourite poem of his . He said his object in it had not been understood . It was a play of the fancy on a domestic incident , and lowly character . He wished by the opening descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he wished it to be read . If he failed in doing that , he wished him to lay it down . He pointed out with the same view , the glowing lines on the state of exultation in which Ben and his companions are under the influence of liquor . Then he read the sickening languor of the morning walk , contrasted with the glorious uprising of Nature , and the songs of the birds . Here he has added about six most exquisite lines . ”</p>
     <p>The lines referred to are doubtless the eight ( p. 101 ) , beginning</p>
     <p>‘ Say more ; for by that power a vein , ’</p>
     <p>which were added in the edition of 1836 .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The following is Sara Coleridge 's criticism of ‘ The Waggoner ’ . ( See</l>
       <l n="2">‘ Biographia Literaria ’ , vol . ii . pp . 183 , 184 , edition 1847 . )</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Due honour is done to ‘ Peter Bell ’ , at this time , by students of poetry in general ; but some , even of Mr. Wordsworth 's greatest admirers , do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of ‘ The Waggoner ’ , a poem which my dear uncle , Mr. Southey , preferred even to the former . ‘ Ich will meine Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen ’ , as Lessing says : I will force my way of thinking on nobody , but take the liberty , for my own gratification , to express it . The sketches of hill and valley in this poem have a lightness , and spirit — an Allegro touch — distinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which characterises Mr. Wordsworth 's representations of Nature in general , and from the passive tenderness of those in ‘ The White Doe ’ , while it harmonises well with the human interest of the piece ; indeed it is the harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by its special admirers . In its course it describes , with bold brief touches , the striking mountain tract from Grasmere to Keswick ; it commences with an evening storm among the mountains , presents a lively interior of a country inn during midnight , and concludes after bringing us in sight of St. John 's Vale and the Vale of Keswick seen by day-break — ‘ Skiddaw touched with rosy light , ’ and the prospect from Nathdale Fell ‘ hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn : ’ thus giving a beautiful and well-contrasted Panorama , produced by the most delicate and masterly strokes of the pencil . Well may Mr. Ruskin , a fine observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural appearances , speak of Mr. Wordsworth as the great poetic landscape painter of the age . But Mr. Ruskin has found how seldom the great landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and affections on canvas , or even successful in the introduction of human figures into their foregrounds ; whereas in the poetic paintings of Mr. Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest ; certainly , in ‘ The Waggoner ’ , the little sketch of human nature which occupies , as it were , the front of that encircling background , the picture of Benjamin and his temptations , his humble friends and the mute companions of his way , has a character of its own , combining with sportiveness a homely pathos , which must ever be delightful to some of those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of Mr. Wordsworth 's poetry . It may be compared with the ale-house scene in ‘ Tam o'Shanter ’ , parts of Voss 's Luise , or Ovid 's Baucis and Philemon ; though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each other . The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very beautifully . ”</p>

       <l n="1">The editor of Southey 's ‘ Life and Correspondence ’ — his son , the Rev .</l>
       <l n="2">Charles Cuthbert Southey — tells us , in a note to a letter from S. T .</l>
       <l n="3">Coleridge to his father , that the Waggoner 's name was Jackson ; and that</l>
       <l n="4">“ all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct . ” This</l>
       <l n="5">Jackson , after retiring from active work as waggoner , became the tenant</l>
       <l n="6">of Greta Hall , where first Coleridge , and afterwards Southey lived . The</l>
       <l n="7">Hall was divided into two houses , one of which Jackson occupied , and the</l>
       <l n="8">other of which he let to Coleridge , who speaks thus of him in the letter</l>
       <l n="9">to Southey , dated Greta Hall , Keswick , April 13 , 1801 :</l>

     <p>“ My landlord , who dwells next door , has a very respectable library , which he has put with mine ; histories , encyclopedias , and all the modern poetry , etc . etc . etc . A more truly disinterested man I never met with ; severely frugal , yet almost carelessly generous ; and yet he got all his money as a common carrier , by hard labour , and by pennies and pennies . He is one instance among many in this country of the salutary effect of the love of knowledge — he was from a boy a lover of learning . ”</p>

       <l n="1">Charles Lamb — to whom ‘ The Waggoner ’ was dedicated — wrote thus to</l>
       <l n="2">Wordsworth on 7th June 1819 :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ My dear Wordsworth ,— You cannot imagine how proud we are here of the dedication . We read it twice for once that we do the poem . I mean all through ; yet ‘ Benjamin ’ is no common favourite ; there is a spirit of beautiful tolerance in it . It is as good as it was in 1806 ; and it will be as good in 1829 , if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse it . Methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject of the narrative and the subject of the dedication . ... “ I do not know which I like best ,— the prologue ( the latter part especially ) to ‘ P. Bell , ’ or the epilogue to ‘ Benjamin . ’ Yes , I tell stories ; I do know I like the last best ; and the ‘ Waggoner ’ altogether is a pleasanter remembrance to me than the ‘ Itinerant . ’ ... “ C. LAMB . ”</p>
     <p>( See ‘ The Letters of Charles Lamb , ’ edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . ii . pp . 24-26 . )</p>
     <p>To this may be added what Southey wrote to Mr. Wade Browne on 15th June 1819 :</p>
     <p>“ I think you will be pleased with Wordsworth 's ‘ Waggoner ’ , if it were only for the line of road which it describes . The master of the waggon was my poor landlord Jackson , and the cause of his exchanging it for the one-horse cart was just as is represented in the poem ; nobody but Benjamin could manage it upon these hills , and Benjamin could not resist the temptations by the wayside . ”</p>

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">The following Poem was commenced in the beginning of the year 1799 , and</l>
       <l n="2">completed in the summer of 1805 .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">The design and occasion of the work are described by the Author in his</l>
       <l n="4">Preface to the EXCURSION , first published in 1814 , where he thus speaks :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Several years ago , when the Author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live , it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind , and examine how far Nature and Education had qualified him for such an employment .</p>
     <p>“ As subsidiary to this preparation , he undertook to record , in verse , the origin and progress of his own powers , as far as he was acquainted with them .</p>
     <p>“ That work , addressed to a dear friend , most distinguished for his knowledge and genius , and to whom the author 's intellect is deeply indebted , has been long finished ; and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it , was a determination to compose a philosophical Poem , containing views of Man , Nature , and Society , and to be entitled ‘ The Recluse ; ’ as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement .</p>
     <p>“ The preparatory poem is biographical , and conducts the history of the Author 's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself ; and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other , if he may so express himself , as the Ante-chapel has to the body of a Gothic Church . Continuing this allusion , he may be permitted to add , that his minor pieces , which have been long before the public , when they shall be properly arranged , will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells , oratories , and sepulchral recesses , ordinarily included in those edifices . ”</p>
     <p>Such was the Author 's language in the year 1814 .</p>
     <p>It will thence be seen , that the present Poem was intended to be introductory to the RECLUSE , and that the RECLUSE , if completed , would have consisted of Three Parts . Of these , the Second Part alone , viz . the EXCURSION , was finished , and given to the world by the Author .</p>
     <p>The First Book of the First Part of the RECLUSE still remains in manuscript ; but the Third Part was only planned . The materials of which it would have been formed have , however , been incorporated , for the most part , in the Author 's other Publications , written subsequently to the EXCURSION .</p>
     <p>The Friend , to whom the present Poem is addressed , was the late SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE , who was resident in Malta , for the restoration of his health , when the greater part of it was composed .</p>
     <p>Mr. Coleridge read a considerable portion of the Poem while he was abroad ; and his feelings , on hearing it recited by the Author ( after his return to his own country ) are recorded in his Verses , addressed to Mr. Wordsworth , which will be found in the ‘ Sibylline Leaves , ’ p. 197 , edition 1817 , or ‘ Poetical Works , by S. T. Coleridge , ’ vol . i. p. 206 .</p>
     <p>RYDAL MOUNT , July 13th , 1850 .</p>
     <p>This “ advertisement ” to the first edition of ‘ The Prelude , ’ published in 1850 — the year of Wordsworth 's death — was written by Mr. Carter , who edited the volume . Mr. Carter was for many years the poet 's secretary , and afterwards one of his literary executors . The poem was not only kept back from publication during Wordsworth 's life-time , but it remained without a title ; being alluded to by himself , when he spoke or wrote of it , as “ the poem on my own poetical education , ” the “ poem on my own life , ” etc .</p>
     <p>As ‘ The Prelude ’ is autobiographical , a large part of Wordsworth 's life might be written in the notes appended to it ; but , besides breaking up the text of the poem unduly , this plan has many disadvantages , and would render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or repetitive . The notes which follow will therefore be limited to the explanation of local , historical , and chronological allusions , or to references to Wordsworth 's own career that are not obvious without them . It has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the allusions , to minute points in ancient history , mediæval mythology , and contemporary politics , should be explained or left alone ; but I have preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details , with which every scholar is familiar .</p>
     <p>‘ The Prelude ’ was begun as Wordsworth left the imperial city of Goslar , in Lower Saxony , where he spent part of the last winter of last century , and which he left on the 10th of February 1799 . Only lines 1 to 45 , however , were composed at that time ; and the poem was continued at desultory intervals after the settlement at Grasmere , during 1800 , and following years . Large portions of it were dictated to his devoted amanuenses as he walked , or sat , on the terraces of Lancrigg . Six books were finished by 1805 .</p>
     <p>“ The seventh was begun in the opening of that year ; ... and the remaining seven were written before the end of June 1805 , when his friend Coleridge was in the island of Malta , for the restoration of his health . ”</p>
     <p>( The late Bishop of Lincoln . )</p>
     <p>There is no uncertainty as to the year in which the later books were written ; but there is considerable difficulty in fixing the precise date of the earlier ones . Writing from Grasmere to his friend Francis Wrangham — the letter is undated — Wordsworth says ,</p>
     <p>“ I am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life , which will take five parts or books to complete , three of which are nearly finished . ”</p>
     <p>The late Bishop of Lincoln supposed that this letter to Wrangham was written “ at the close of 1803 , or beginning of 1804 . ” ( See ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth , ’ vol . i. p . 303 . ) There is evidence that it belongs to 1804 . At the commencement of the seventh book , p. 247 , he says :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Six changeful years have vanished since I first</l>
       <l n="2">Poured out ( saluted by that quickening breeze</l>
       <l n="3">Which met me issuing from the City 's walls )</l>
       <l n="4">A glad preamble to this Verse : I sang</l>
       <l n="5">Aloud , with fervour irresistible</l>
       <l n="6">Of short-lived transport , like a torrent bursting ,</l>
       <l n="7">From a black thunder-cloud , down Scafell 's side</l>
       <l n="8">To rush and disappear . But soon broke forth</l>
       <l n="9">( So willed the Muse ) a less impetuous stream ,</l>
       <l n="10">That flowed awhile with unabating strength ,</l>
       <l n="11">Then stopped for years ; not audible again</l>
       <l n="12">Before last primrose-time .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I have italicised the clauses which give some clue to the dates of composition . From these it would appear that the “ glad preamble , ” written on leaving Goslar in 1799 ( which , I think , included only the first two paragraphs of book first ) , was a “ short-lived transport ” ; but that “ soon ” afterwards “ a less impetuous stream ” broke forth , which , after the settlement at Grasmere , “ flowed awhile with unabating strength , ” and then “ stopped for years . ” Now the above passage , recording these things , was written in 1805 , and in the late autumn of that year ; ( as is evident from the reference which immediately follows to the “ choir of redbreasts ” and the approach of winter ) . We must therefore assign the flowing of the “ less impetuous stream , ” to 1802 ; in order to leave room for the intervening “ years , ” in which it ceased to flow , till it was audible again in the spring of 1804 , “ last primrose-time . ”</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">A second reference to date occurs in the sixth book , p. 224 , entitled</l>
       <l n="2">“ Cambridge and the Alps , ” in which he says ,</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">

       <l n="4">Have I been now a sojourner on earth .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>This fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of that part of the work , viz . April 1804 , which corresponds exactly to the “ last primrose-time ” of the previous extract from the seventh book , in which he tells us that after its long silence , his Muse was heard again . So far Wordsworth 's own allusions to the date of ‘ The Prelude . ’</p>
     <p>But there are others supplied by his own , and his sister 's letters , and also by the Grasmere Journal . In the Dove Cottage household it was known , and talked of , as “ the Poem to Coleridge ; ” and Dorothy records , on 11th January 1803 , that her brother was working at it . On 13th February 1804 , she writes to Mrs. Clarkson that her brother was engaged on a poem on his own life , and was “ going on with great rapidity . ” On the 6th of March 1804 , Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De Quincey ,</p>
     <p>“ I am now writing a poem on my own earlier life : I have just finished that part of it in which I speak of my residence at the University . ” ... It is “ better than half complete , viz . four books , amounting to about 2500 lines . "[ A ]</p>
     <p>On the 24th of March , Dorothy wrote to Mrs. Clarkson , that since Coleridge left them ( which was in January 1804 ) , her brother had added 1500 lines to the poem on his own life . On the 29th of April 1804 , Wordsworth wrote to Richard Sharpe ,</p>
     <p>“ I have been very busy these last ten weeks : having written between two and three thousand lines — accurately near three thousand — in that time ; namely , four books , and a third of another . I am at present at the Seventh Book . ”</p>
     <p>On the 25th December 1804 , he wrote to Sir George Beaumont ,</p>
     <p>“ I have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks . ”</p>
     <p>We thus find that Books I. to IV . had been written by the 6th of March 1804 , that from the 19th February to the 29th of April nearly 3000 lines were written , that March and April were specially productive months , for by the 29th April he had reached Book VII . while from 16th October to 25th December he wrote over 2000 lines .</p>
     <p>Dorothy and Mary Wordsworth transcribed the earlier books more than once , and a copy of some of them was given to Coleridge to take with him to Malta .</p>
     <p>It is certain that the remaining books of ‘ The Prelude ’ were all written in the spring and early summer of 1805 ; the seventh , eighth , ninth , tenth , eleventh , and part of the twelfth being finished about the middle of April ; the last 300 lines of book twelfth in the last week of April ; and the two remaining books — the thirteenth and fourteenth — before the 20th of May . The following extracts from letters of Wordsworth to Sir George Beaumont make this clear , and also cast light on matters much more important than the mere dates of composition .</p>
     <p>GRASMERE , Dec. 25 , 1804 .</p>
     <p>“ My dear Sir George ,— You will be pleased to hear that I have been advancing with my work : I have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks . I do not know if you are exactly acquainted with the plan of my poetical labour : It is twofold ; first , a Poem , to be called ‘ The Recluse ; ’ in which it will be my object to express in verse my most interesting feelings concerning man , nature , and society ; and next , a poem ( in which I am at present chiefly engaged ) on my earlier life , or the growth of my own mind , taken up upon a large scale . This latter work I expect to have finished before the month of May ; and then I purpose to fall with all my might on the former , which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been fixed these many years . Of this poem , that of ‘ The Pedlar , ’ which Coleridge read to you , is part ; and I may have written of it altogether about 2000 lines . It will consist , I hope , of about ten or twelve thousand . ”</p>
     <p>GRASMERE , May 1 , 1805 .</p>
     <p>“ Unable to proceed with this work , [ B ] I turned my thoughts again to the ‘ Poem on my own Life ’ , and you will be glad to hear that I have added 300 lines to it in the course of last week . Two books more will conclude it . It will not be much less than 9000 lines ,— not hundred but thousand lines long ,— an alarming length ! and a thing unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about himself . It is not self-conceit , as you will know well , that has induced me to do this , but real humility . I began the work because I was unprepared to treat any more arduous subject , and diffident of my own powers . Here , at least , I hoped that to a certain degree I should be sure of succeeding , as I had nothing to do but describe what I had felt and thought , and therefore could not easily be bewildered . This might have been done in narrower compass by a man of more address ; but I have done my best . If , when the work shall be finished , it appears to the judicious to have redundancies , they shall be lopped off , if possible ; but this is very difficult to do , when a man has written with thought ; and this defect , whenever I have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of mine , I have always found it incurable . The fault lies too deep , and is in the first conception . ”</p>
     <p>GRASMERE , June 3 , 1805 .</p>
     <p>“ I have the pleasure to say that I finished my poem about a fortnight ago . I had looked forward to the day as a most happy one ; ... But it was not a happy day for me ; I was dejected on many accounts : when I looked back upon the performance , it seemed to have a dead weight about it ,— the reality so far short of the expectation . It was the first long labour that I had finished ; and the doubt whether I should ever live to write ‘ The Recluse ’ , and the sense which I had of this poem being so far below what I seemed capable of executing , depressed me much ; above all , many heavy thoughts of my poor departed brother hung upon me , the joy which I should have had in showing him the manuscript , and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams . I have spoken of this , because it was a state of feeling new to me , the occasion being new . This work may be considered as a sort of portico to ‘ The Recluse ’ , part of the same building , which I hope to be able , ere long , to begin with in earnest ; and if I am permitted to bring it to a conclusion , and to write , further , a narrative poem of the epic kind , I shall consider the task of my life as over . I ought to add , that I have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of so alarming a length as I apprehended . ”</p>
     <p>These letters explain the delay in the publication of ‘ The Prelude ’ . They show that what led Wordsworth to write so much about himself was not self-conceit , but self-diffidence . He felt unprepared as yet for the more arduous task he had set before himself . He saw its faults as clearly , or more clearly , than the critics who condemned him . He knew that its length was excessive . He tried to condense it ; he kept it beside him unpublished , and occasionally revised it , with a view to condensation , in vain . The text received his final corrections in the year 1832 .</p>
     <p>Wordsworth 's reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem , ‘ The Recluse ’ , other than ‘ The Excursion ’ , during his lifetime , was a matter of surprise to his friends ; to whom he , or the ladies of his household , had read portions of it . In the year 1819 , Charles Lamb wrote to him ,</p>
     <p>“ If , as you say , ‘ The Waggoner ’ , in some sort , came at my call , oh for a potent voice to call forth ‘ The Recluse ’ from his profound dormitory , where he sleeps forgetful of his foolish charge — the world ! ”</p>
     <p>( ‘ The Letters of Charles Lamb ’ , edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . ii . p . 26 . )</p>
     <p>The admission made in the letter of May 1st , 1805 , is note-worthy :</p>
     <p>“ This defect ” ( of redundancy ) “ whenever I have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of mine , I have always found incurable . The fault lies too deep , and is in the first conception . ”</p>
     <p>The actual result — in the Poem he had at length committed to writing — was so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise , that he could never be induced to publish it . He spoke of the MS. as forming a sort of portico to his larger work — the poem on Man , Nature , and Society — which he meant to call ‘ The Recluse ’ , and of which one portion only , viz . ‘ The Excursion ’ , was finished . It is clear that throughout the composition of ‘ The Prelude ’ , he felt that he was experimenting with his powers . He wished to find out whether he could construct “ a literary work that might live , ” on a larger scale than his Lyrics ; and it was on the writing of a “ philosophical poem , ” dealing with Man and Nature , in their deepest aspects , that his thoughts had been fixed for many years . From the letter to Sir George Beaumont , December 25 , 1804 , it is evident that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this larger work , to which he hoped to turn “ with all his might ” after ‘ The Prelude ’ was finished , and of which he had already written about a fifth or a sixth ( see ‘ Memoirs ’ , vol . i. p. 304 ) . This was the part known in the Grasmere household as “ The Pedlar , ” a title given to it from the character of the Wanderer , but afterwards happily set aside . He did not devote himself , however , to the completion of his wider purpose , immediately after ‘ The Prelude ’ was finished . He wrote one book of ‘ The Recluse ’ which he called “ Home at Grasmere ” ; and , though detached from ‘ The Prelude ’ , it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life at the point where it is left off in the latter poem . It consists of 733 lines . Two extracts from it were published in the ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ in 1851 ( vol . i. pp . 151 and 155 ) , beginning ,</p>
     <p>‘ On Nature 's invitation do I come , ’</p>
     <p>and</p>
     <p>‘ Bleak season was it , turbulent and bleak . ’</p>
     <p>These will be found in vol . ii . of this edition , pp . 118 and 121 respectively .</p>
     <p>The autobiographical poem remained , as already stated , during Wordsworth 's lifetime without a title . The name finally adopted — ‘ The Prelude ’ — was suggested by Mrs. Wordsworth , both to indicate its relation to the larger work , and the fact of its having been written comparatively early .</p>
     <p>As the poem was addressed to Coleridge , it may be desirable to add in this place his critical verdict upon it ; along with the poem which he wrote , on hearing Wordsworth read a portion of it to him , in the winter of 1806 , at Coleorton .</p>
     <p>In his ‘ Table Talk ’ ( London , 1835 , vol . ii . p. 70 ) , Coleridge 's opinion is recorded thus :</p>
     <p>“ I cannot help regretting that Wordsworth did not first publish his thirteen ( fourteen ) books on the growth of an individual mind — superior , as I used to think , upon the whole to ‘ The Excursion ’ . You may judge how I felt about them by my own Poem upon the occasion . Then the plan laid out , and , I believe , partly suggested by me , was , that Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose , one whose principles were made up , and so prepared to deliver upon authority a system of philosophy . He was to treat man as man ,— a subject of eye , ear , touch , and taste in contact with external nature , and informing the senses from the mind , and not compounding a mind out of the senses ; then he was to describe the pastoral and other states of society , assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he approached the high civilisation of cities and towns , and opening a melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice ; thence he was to infer and reveal the proof of , and necessity for , the whole state of man and society being subject to , and illustrative of a redemptive process in operation , showing how this idea reconciled all the anomalies , and promised future glory and restoration . Something of this sort was , I think , agreed on . It is , in substance , what I have been all my life doing in my system of philosophy .</p>
     <p>“ I think Wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great Philosopher than any man I ever knew , or , as I believe , has existed in England since Milton ; but it seems to me that he ought never to have abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarly — perhaps , I might say exclusively — fitted for him . His proper title is ‘ Spectator ab extra ’ . ”</p>

       <l n="53">A renovated spirit singled out ,</l>
       <l n="54">Such hope was mine , for holy services .</l>
       <l n="55">My own voice cheered me , and , far more , the mind 's 55</l>
       <l n="56">Internal echo of the imperfect sound ;</l>
       <l n="57">To both I listened , drawing from them both</l>
       <l n="58">A cheerful confidence in things to come .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="59">Content and not unwilling now to give</l>
       <l n="60">A respite to this passion , I paced on 60</l>
       <l n="61">With brisk and eager steps ; and came , at length ,</l>
       <l n="62">To a green shady place , [ E ] where down I sate</l>
       <l n="63">Beneath a tree , slackening my thoughts by choice ,</l>
       <l n="64">And settling into gentler happiness .</l>
       <l n="65">‘ Twas autumn , and a clear and placid day , 65</l>
       <l n="66">With warmth , as much as needed , from a sun</l>
       <l n="67">Two hours declined towards the west ; a day</l>
       <l n="68">With silver clouds , and sunshine on the grass ,</l>
       <l n="69">And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove</l>
       <l n="70">A perfect stillness . Many were the thoughts 70</l>
       <l n="71">Encouraged and dismissed , till choice was made</l>
       <l n="72">Of a known Vale , [ F ] whither my feet should turn ,</l>
       <l n="73">Nor rest till they had reached the very door</l>
       <l n="74">Of the one cottage [ G ] which methought I saw .</l>
       <l n="75">No picture of mere memory ever looked 75</l>
       <l n="76">So fair ; and while upon the fancied scene</l>
       <l n="77">I gazed with growing love , a higher power</l>
       <l n="78">Than Fancy gave assurance of some work</l>
       <l n="79">Of glory there forthwith to be begun ,</l>
       <l n="80">Perhaps too there performed . Thus long I mused , 80</l>
       <l n="81">Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon ,</l>
       <l n="82">Save when , amid the stately groves of oaks ,</l>
       <l n="83">Now here , now there , an acorn , from its cup</l>
       <l n="84">Dislodged , through sere leaves rustled , or at once</l>
       <l n="85">To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound . 85</l>
       <l n="86">From that soft couch I rose not , till the sun</l>
       <l n="87">Had almost touched the horizon ; casting then</l>
       <l n="88">A backward glance upon the curling cloud</l>
       <l n="89">Of city smoke , by distance ruralised ;</l>
       <l n="90">Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive , 90</l>
       <l n="91">But as a Pilgrim resolute , I took ,</l>
       <l n="92">Even with the chance equipment of that hour ,</l>
       <l n="93">The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale . [ F ]</l>
       <l n="94">It was a splendid evening , and my soul</l>
       <l n="95">Once more made trial of her strength , nor lacked 95</l>
       <l n="96">Æolian visitations ; but the harp</l>
       <l n="97">Was soon defrauded , and the banded host</l>
       <l n="98">Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds ,</l>
       <l n="99">And lastly utter silence ! “ Be it so ;</l>
       <l n="100">Why think of any thing but present good ? ” [ H ] 100</l>
       <l n="101">So , like a home-bound labourer I pursued</l>
       <l n="102">My way beneath the mellowing sun , that shed</l>
       <l n="103">Mild influence ; nor left in me one wish</l>
       <l n="104">Again to bend the Sabbath of that time</l>
       <l n="105">To a servile yoke . What need of many words ? 105</l>
       <l n="106">A pleasant loitering journey , through three days</l>
       <l n="107">Continued , brought me to my hermitage , [ I ]</l>
       <l n="108">I spare to tell of what ensued , the life</l>
       <l n="109">In common things — the endless store of things ,</l>
       <l n="110">Rare , or at least so seeming , every day 110</l>
       <l n="111">Found all about me in one neighbourhood —</l>
       <l n="112">The self-congratulation , and , from morn</l>
       <l n="113">To night , unbroken cheerfulness serene . [ K ]</l>
       <l n="114">But speedily an earnest longing rose</l>
       <l n="115">To brace myself to some determined aim , 115</l>
       <l n="116">Reading or thinking ; either to lay up</l>
       <l n="117">New stores , or rescue from decay the old</l>
       <l n="118">By timely interference : and therewith</l>
       <l n="119">Came hopes still higher , that with outward life</l>
       <l n="120">I might endue some airy phantasies 120</l>
       <l n="121">That had been floating loose about for years ,</l>
       <l n="122">And to such beings temperately deal forth</l>
       <l n="123">The many feelings that oppressed my heart .</l>
       <l n="124">That hope hath been discouraged ; welcome light</l>
       <l n="125">Dawns from the east , but dawns to disappear 125</l>
       <l n="126">And mock me with a sky that ripens not</l>
       <l n="127">Into a steady morning : if my mind ,</l>
       <l n="128">Remembering the bold promise of the past ,</l>
       <l n="129">Would gladly grapple with some noble theme ,</l>
       <l n="130">Vain is her wish ; where'er she turns she finds 130</l>
       <l n="131">Impediments from day to day renewed .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="5">
       <l n="132">And now it would content me to yield up</l>

       <l n="135">The Poet , gentle creature as he is , 135</l>
       <l n="136">Hath , like the Lover , his unruly times ;</l>

       <l n="138">Though no distress be near him but his own</l>
       <l n="139">Unmanageable thoughts : his mind , best pleased</l>
       <l n="140">While she as duteous as the mother dove 140</l>
       <l n="141">Sits brooding , lives not always to that end ,</l>
       <l n="142">But like the innocent bird , hath goadings on</l>
       <l n="143">That drive her as in trouble through the groves ; [ L ]</l>
       <l n="144">With me is now such passion , to be blamed</l>

       <l n="361">Straight I unloosed her chain , and stepping in 360</l>
       <l n="362">Pushed from the shore . It was an act of stealth</l>
       <l n="363">And troubled pleasure , nor without the voice</l>
       <l n="364">Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on ;</l>
       <l n="365">Leaving behind her still , on either side ,</l>
       <l n="366">Small circles glittering idly in the moon , 365</l>
       <l n="367">Until they melted all into one track</l>
       <l n="368">Of sparkling light . But now , like one who rows ,</l>
       <l n="369">Proud of his skill , to reach a chosen point</l>
       <l n="370">With an unswerving line , I fixed my view</l>

       <l n="372">The horizon 's utmost boundary ; far above</l>

It is not of course , in any sense peculiar to the English lakes ; but there are probably few districts where the peculiar noise referred to can be heard so easily or frequently .

       <l n="2">Thus far , O Friend ! have we , though leaving much</l>
       <l n="3">Unvisited , endeavoured to retrace</l>
       <l n="4">The simple ways in which my childhood walked ;</l>
       <l n="5">Those chiefly that first led me to the love</l>
       <l n="6">Of rivers , woods , and fields . The passion yet 5</l>
       <l n="7">Was in its birth , sustained as might befal</l>
       <l n="8">By nourishment that came unsought ; for still</l>
       <l n="9">From week to week , from month to month , we lived</l>
       <l n="10">A round of tumult . Duly were our games</l>
       <l n="11">Prolonged in summer till the day-light failed : 10</l>
       <l n="12">No chair remained before the doors ; the bench</l>
       <l n="13">And threshold steps were empty ; fast asleep</l>
       <l n="14">The labourer , and the old man who had sate</l>
       <l n="15">A later lingerer ; yet the revelry</l>
       <l n="16">Continued and the loud uproar : at last , 15</l>
       <l n="17">When all the ground was dark , and twinkling stars</l>
       <l n="18">Edged the black clouds , home and to bed we went ,</l>
       <l n="19">Feverish with weary joints and beating minds .</l>
       <l n="20">Ah ! is there one who ever has been young ,</l>
       <l n="21">Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride 20</l>
       <l n="22">Of intellect and virtue 's self-esteem ?</l>
       <l n="23">One is there , though the wisest and the best</l>
       <l n="24">Of all mankind , who covets not at times</l>
       <l n="25">Union that cannot be ;— who would not give ,</l>
       <l n="26">If so he might , to duty and to truth 25</l>
       <l n="27">The eagerness of infantine desire ?</l>
       <l n="28">A tranquillising spirit presses now</l>
       <l n="29">On my corporeal frame , so wide appears</l>
       <l n="30">The vacancy between me and those days</l>
       <l n="31">Which yet have such self-presence in my mind , 30</l>
       <l n="32">That , musing on them , often do I seem</l>
       <l n="33">Two consciousnesses , conscious of myself</l>
       <l n="34">And of some other Being . A rude mass</l>
       <l n="35">Of native rock , left midway in the square</l>
       <l n="36">Of our small market village , was the goal 35</l>
       <l n="37">Or centre of these sports ; [ A ] and when , returned</l>
       <l n="38">After long absence , thither I repaired ,</l>
       <l n="39">Gone was the old grey stone , and in its place</l>
       <l n="40">A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground</l>
       <l n="41">That had been ours . There let the fiddle scream , 40</l>
       <l n="42">And be ye happy ! Yet , my Friends ! I know</l>
       <l n="43">That more than one of you will think with me</l>
       <l n="44">Of those soft starry nights , and that old Dame</l>
       <l n="45">From whom the stone was named , who there had sate ,</l>
       <l n="46">And watched her table with its huckster 's wares 45</l>
       <l n="47">Assiduous , through the length of sixty years .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="48">We ran a boisterous course ; the year span round</l>
       <l n="49">With giddy motion . But the time approached</l>
       <l n="50">That brought with it a regular desire</l>
       <l n="51">For calmer pleasures , when the winning forms 50</l>
       <l n="52">Of Nature were collaterally attached</l>
       <l n="53">To every scheme of holiday delight</l>
       <l n="54">And every boyish sport , less grateful else</l>
       <l n="55">And languidly pursued .</l>
       <l n="56">When summer came ,</l>
       <l n="57">Our pastime was , on bright half-holidays , 55</l>
       <l n="58">To sweep , along the plain of Windermere</l>
       <l n="59">With rival oars ; [ B ] and the selected bourne</l>
       <l n="60">Was now an Island musical with birds</l>
       <l n="61">That sang and ceased not ; now a Sister Isle</l>
       <l n="62">Beneath the oaks ’ umbrageous covert , sown 60</l>
       <l n="63">With lilies of the valley like a field ; [ C ]</l>
       <l n="64">And now a third small Island , where survived</l>
       <l n="65">In solitude the ruins of a shrine</l>
       <l n="66">Once to Our Lady dedicate , and served</l>
       <l n="67">Daily with chaunted rites . [ D ] In such a race 65</l>
       <l n="68">So ended , disappointment could be none ,</l>
       <l n="69">Uneasiness , or pain , or jealousy :</l>
       <l n="70">We rested in the shade , all pleased alike ,</l>
       <l n="71">Conquered and conqueror . Thus the pride of strength ,</l>
       <l n="72">And the vain-glory of superior skill , 70</l>
       <l n="73">Were tempered ; thus was gradually produced</l>
       <l n="74">A quiet independence of the heart ;</l>
       <l n="75">And to my Friend who knows me I may add ,</l>
       <l n="76">Fearless of blame , that hence for future days</l>
       <l n="77">Ensued a diffidence and modesty , 75</l>
       <l n="78">And I was taught to feel , perhaps too much ,</l>
       <l n="79">The self-sufficing power of Solitude .</l>

       <l n="80">Our daily meals were frugal , Sabine fare !</l>
       <l n="81">More than we wished we knew the blessing then</l>
       <l n="82">Of vigorous hunger — hence corporeal strength 80</l>
       <l n="83">Unsapped by delicate viands ; for , exclude</l>
       <l n="84">A little weekly stipend , and we lived</l>
       <l n="85">Through three divisions of the quartered year</l>
       <l n="86">In penniless poverty . But now to school</l>
       <l n="87">From the half-yearly holidays returned , 85</l>
       <l n="88">We came with weightier purses , that sufficed</l>
       <l n="89">To furnish treats more costly than the Dame</l>
       <l n="90">Of the old grey stone , from her scant board , supplied .</l>
       <l n="91">Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground ,</l>
       <l n="92">Or in the woods , or by a river side 90</l>
       <l n="93">Or shady fountains , while among the leaves</l>
       <l n="94">Soft airs were stirring , and the mid-day sun</l>
       <l n="95">Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy .</l>
       <l n="96">Nor is my aim neglected if I tell</l>
       <l n="97">How sometimes , in the length of those half-years , 95</l>
       <l n="98">We from our funds drew largely ;— proud to curb ,</l>
       <l n="99">And eager to spur on , the galloping steed ;</l>
       <l n="100">And with the courteous inn-keeper , whose stud</l>
       <l n="101">Supplied our want , we haply might employ</l>
       <l n="102">Sly subterfuge , if the adventure 's bound 100</l>
       <l n="103">Were distant : some famed temple where of yore</l>
       <l n="104">The Druids worshipped , [ E ] or the antique walls</l>
       <l n="105">Of that large abbey , where within the Vale</l>
       <l n="106">Of Nightshade , to St. Mary 's honour built , [ F ]</l>
       <l n="107">Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch , 105</l>
       <l n="108">Belfry , [ G ] and images , and living trees ,</l>
       <l n="109">A holy scene ! Along the smooth green turf</l>
       <l n="110">Our horses grazed . To more than inland peace</l>
       <l n="111">Left by the west wind sweeping overhead</l>
       <l n="112">From a tumultuous ocean , trees and towers 110</l>
       <l n="113">In that sequestered valley may be seen ,</l>
       <l n="114">Both silent and both motionless alike ;</l>
       <l n="115">Such the deep shelter that is there , and such</l>

       <l n="117">Our steeds remounted and the summons given , 115</l>
       <l n="118">With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew</l>
       <l n="119">In uncouth race , and left the cross-legged knight ,</l>
       <l n="120">And the stone-abbot , [ H ] and that single wren</l>
       <l n="121">Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave</l>
       <l n="122">Of the old church , that — though from recent showers 120</l>
       <l n="123">The earth was comfortless , and touched by faint</l>
       <l n="124">Internal breezes , sobbings of the place</l>
       <l n="125">And respirations , from the roofless walls</l>
       <l n="126">The shuddering ivy dripped large drops — yet still</l>
       <l n="127">So sweetly ‘ mid the gloom the invisible bird 125</l>
       <l n="128">Sang to herself , that there I could have made</l>
       <l n="129">My dwelling-place , and lived for ever there</l>
       <l n="130">To hear such music . Through the walls we flew</l>
       <l n="131">And down the valley , and , a circuit made</l>
       <l n="132">In wantonness of heart , through rough and smooth 130</l>
       <l n="133">We scampered homewards . Oh , ye rocks and streams ,</l>
       <l n="134">And that still spirit shed from evening air !</l>
       <l n="135">Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt</l>
       <l n="136">Your presence , when with slackened step we breathed</l>

       <l n="140">Midway on long Winander 's eastern shore ,</l>
       <l n="141">Within the crescent of a pleasant bay , [ I ]</l>
       <l n="142">A tavern stood ; [ K ] no homely-featured house , 140</l>
       <l n="143">Primeval like its neighbouring cottages ,</l>
       <l n="144">But ‘ twas a splendid place , the door beset</l>
       <l n="145">With chaises , grooms , and liveries , and within</l>
       <l n="146">Decanters , glasses , and the blood-red wine .</l>
       <l n="147">In ancient times , and ere the Hall was built 145</l>
       <l n="148">On the large island , had this dwelling been</l>
       <l n="149">More worthy of a poet 's love , a hut ,</l>
       <l n="150">Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade .</l>
       <l n="151">But — though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed</l>
       <l n="152">The threshold , and large golden characters , 150</l>
       <l n="153">Spread o'er the spangled sign-board , had dislodged</l>
       <l n="154">The old Lion and usurped his place , in slight</l>
       <l n="155">And mockery of the rustic painter 's hand — [ L ]</l>
       <l n="156">Yet , to this hour , the spot to me is dear</l>
       <l n="157">With all its foolish pomp . The garden lay 155</l>
       <l n="158">Upon a slope surmounted by a plain</l>
       <l n="159">Of a small bowling-green ; beneath us stood</l>
       <l n="160">A grove , with gleams of water through the trees</l>
       <l n="161">And over the tree-tops ; [ M ] nor did we want</l>
       <l n="162">Refreshment , strawberries and mellow cream . 160</l>
       <l n="163">There , while through half an afternoon we played</l>
       <l n="164">On the smooth platform , whether skill prevailed</l>
       <l n="165">Or happy blunder triumphed , bursts of glee</l>
       <l n="166">Made all the mountains ring . But , ere night-fall ,</l>
       <l n="167">When in our pinnace we returned at leisure 165</l>
       <l n="168">Over the shadowy lake , and to the beach</l>
       <l n="169">Of some small island steered our course with one ,</l>
       <l n="170">The Minstrel of the Troop , and left him there , [ N ]</l>
       <l n="171">And rowed off gently , while he blew his flute</l>
       <l n="172">Alone upon the rock — oh , then , the calm 170</l>
       <l n="173">And dead still water lay upon my mind</l>
       <l n="174">Even with a weight of pleasure , and the sky ,</l>
       <l n="175">Never before so beautiful , sank down</l>
       <l n="176">Into my heart , and held me like a dream !</l>
       <l n="177">Thus were my sympathies enlarged , and thus 175</l>

       <l n="179">Grew dear to me : already I began</l>
       <l n="180">To love the sun ; a boy I loved the sun ,</l>
       <l n="181">Not as I since have loved him , as a pledge</l>
       <l n="182">And surety of our earthly life , a light 180</l>
       <l n="183">Which we behold and feel we are alive ; [ O ]</l>

       <l n="187">The western mountain [ P ] touch his setting orb , 185</l>
       <l n="188">In many a thoughtless hour , when , from excess</l>
       <l n="189">Of happiness , my blood appeared to flow</l>
       <l n="190">For its own pleasure , and I breathed with joy .</l>

       <l n="283">The props of my affections were removed ,</l>
       <l n="284">And yet the building stood , as if sustained 280</l>
       <l n="285">By its own spirit ! All that I beheld</l>
       <l n="286">Was dear , and hence to finer influxes</l>
       <l n="287">The mind lay open to a more exact</l>
       <l n="288">And close communion . Many are our joys</l>

       <l n="295">Which , but for this most watchful power of love ,</l>
       <l n="296">Had been neglected ; left a register</l>

       <l n="304">Perceived in things , where , to the unwatchful eye , 300</l>
       <l n="305">No difference is , and hence , from the same source ,</l>
       <l n="306">Sublimer joy ; for I would walk alone ,</l>
       <l n="307">Under the quiet stars , and at that time</l>

       <l n="353">Oft in these moments such a holy calm</l>
       <l n="354">Would overspread my soul , that bodily eyes</l>
       <l n="355">Were utterly forgotten , and what I saw 350</l>
       <l n="356">Appeared like something in myself , a dream ,</l>
       <l n="357">A prospect in the mind . [ Z ]</l>

       <l n="361">Evening and morning , sleep and waking , thought 355</l>

       <l n="371">A local spirit of his own , at war 365</l>

       <l n="373">Subservient strictly to external things</l>
       <l n="374">With which it communed . An auxiliar light</l>

       <l n="387">More pleasing , and whose character I deem 380</l>
       <l n="388">Is more poetic as resembling more</l>
       <l n="389">Creative agency . The song would speak</l>

       <l n="424">O'ercome by humblest prelude of that strain ,</l>

       <l n="460">In silence , or with keen devouring noise</l>

William lost the chance , indeed the certainty , of a fellowship , by not combating his inclinations . He gave way to his natural dislike to studies so dry as many parts of the mathematics , consequently could not succeed in Cambridge . He reads Italian , Spanish , French , Greek , Latin , and English ; but never opens a mathematical book ....

       <l n="17">Without a cordial greeting . Thence with speed</l>
       <l n="18">Up the familiar hill I took my way [ C ]</l>
       <l n="19">Towards that sweet Valley [ D ] where I had been reared ;</l>
       <l n="20">‘ Twas but a short hour 's walk , ere veering round 20</l>
       <l n="21">I saw the snow-white church upon her hill [ E ]</l>
       <l n="22">Sit like a thronèd Lady , sending out</l>
       <l n="23">A gracious look all over her domain . [ F ]</l>
       <l n="24">Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town ;</l>
       <l n="25">With eager footsteps I advance and reach 25</l>
       <l n="26">The cottage threshold where my journey closed .</l>
       <l n="27">Glad welcome had I , with some tears , perhaps ,</l>
       <l n="28">From my old Dame , so kind and motherly , [ G ]</l>
       <l n="29">While she perused me with a parent 's pride .</l>
       <l n="30">The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew 30</l>
       <l n="31">Upon thy grave , good creature ! While my heart</l>
       <l n="32">Can beat never will I forget thy name .</l>
       <l n="33">Heaven 's blessing be upon thee where thou liest</l>
       <l n="34">After thy innocent and busy stir</l>
       <l n="35">In narrow cares , thy little daily growth 35</l>
       <l n="36">Of calm enjoyments , after eighty years ,</l>
       <l n="37">And more than eighty , of untroubled life , [ H ]</l>
       <l n="38">Childless , yet by the strangers to thy blood</l>
       <l n="39">Honoured with little less than filial love .</l>
       <l n="40">What joy was mine to see thee once again , 40</l>
       <l n="41">Thee and thy dwelling , and a crowd of things</l>
       <l n="42">About its narrow precincts all beloved , [ I ]</l>

       <l n="46">The rooms , the court , the garden were not left</l>
       <l n="47">Long unsaluted , nor the sunny seat</l>
       <l n="48">Round the stone table under the dark pine , [ K ]</l>
       <l n="49">Friendly to studious or to festive hours ;</l>
       <l n="50">Nor that unruly child of mountain birth , 50</l>
       <l n="51">The famous brook , who , soon as he was boxed</l>
       <l n="52">Within our garden , [ L ] found himself at once ,</l>
       <l n="53">As if by trick insidious and unkind ,</l>
       <l n="54">Stripped of his voice [ M ] and left to dimple down</l>
       <l n="55">( Without an effort and without a will ) 55</l>
       <l n="56">A channel paved by man 's officious care . [ N ]</l>
       <l n="57">I looked at him and smiled , and smiled again ,</l>

       <l n="59">“ Ha , ” quoth I , “ pretty prisoner , are you there ! ”</l>
       <l n="60">Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered , 60</l>

       <l n="66">I willing , nay — nay , wishing to be led .</l>
       <l n="67">— The face of every neighbour whom I met</l>
       <l n="68">Was like a volume to me ; some were hailed</l>
       <l n="69">Upon the road , some busy at their work ,</l>
       <l n="70">Unceremonious greetings interchanged 70</l>
       <l n="71">With half the length of a long field between .</l>
       <l n="72">Among my schoolfellows I scattered round</l>
       <l n="73">Like recognitions , but with some constraint</l>
       <l n="74">Attended , doubtless , with a little pride ,</l>
       <l n="75">But with more shame , for my habiliments , 75</l>
       <l n="76">The transformation wrought by gay attire .</l>
       <l n="77">Not less delighted did I take my place</l>
       <l n="78">At our domestic table : and , [ P ] dear Friend</l>

       <l n="80">A Poet 's history , may I leave untold 80</l>
       <l n="81">The thankfulness with which I laid me down</l>
       <l n="82">In my accustomed bed , more welcome now</l>
       <l n="83">Perhaps than if it had been more desired</l>
       <l n="84">Or been more often thought of with regret ;</l>
       <l n="85">That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind 85</l>
       <l n="86">Roar and the rain beat hard , where I so oft</l>
       <l n="87">Had lain awake on summer nights to watch</l>
       <l n="88">The moon in splendour couched among the leaves</l>
       <l n="89">Of a tall ash , that near our cottage stood ; [ Q ]</l>
       <l n="90">Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro 90</l>
       <l n="91">In the dark summit of the waving tree</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="93">Among the favourites whom it pleased me well</l>
       <l n="94">To see again , was one by ancient right</l>
       <l n="95">Our inmate , a rough terrier of the hills ; 95</l>
       <l n="96">By birth and call of nature pre-ordained</l>
       <l n="97">To hunt the badger and unearth the fox</l>
       <l n="98">Among the impervious crags , but having been</l>
       <l n="99">From youth our own adopted , he had passed</l>
       <l n="100">Into a gentler service . And when first 100</l>
       <l n="101">The boyish spirit flagged , and day by day</l>
       <l n="102">Along my veins I kindled with the stir ,</l>
       <l n="103">The fermentation , and the vernal heat</l>
       <l n="104">Of poesy , affecting private shades</l>
       <l n="105">Like a sick Lover , then this dog was used 105</l>
       <l n="106">To watch me , an attendant and a friend ,</l>
       <l n="107">Obsequious to my steps early and late ,</l>

       <l n="109">Tired , and uneasy at the halts I made .</l>
       <l n="110">A hundred times when , roving high and low 110</l>
       <l n="111">I have been harassed with the toil of verse ,</l>
       <l n="112">Much pains and little progress , and at once</l>
       <l n="113">Some lovely Image in the song rose up</l>
       <l n="114">Full-formed , like Venus rising from the sea ;</l>
       <l n="115">Then have I darted forwards to let 115</l>
       <l n="116">My hand upon his back with stormy joy ,</l>
       <l n="117">Caressing him again and yet again .</l>
       <l n="118">And when at evening on the public way</l>
       <l n="119">I sauntered , like a river murmuring</l>
       <l n="120">And talking to itself when all things 120</l>
       <l n="121">Are still , the creature trotted on before ;</l>
       <l n="122">Such was his custom ; but whene'er he met</l>
       <l n="123">A passenger approaching , he would turn</l>
       <l n="124">To give me timely notice , and straightway ,</l>

       <l n="128">To give and take a greeting that might save</l>
       <l n="129">My name from piteous rumours , such as wait</l>

       <l n="131">Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved —</l>

       <l n="133">But they were richly laden with all good ,</l>

       <l n="135">And gratitude , and perfect joy of heart — 135</l>
       <l n="136">Those walks in all their freshness now came back</l>
       <l n="137">Like a returning Spring . When first I made</l>

       <l n="139">If ever happiness hath lodged with man ,</l>
       <l n="140">That day consummate happiness was mine , 140</l>
       <l n="141">Wide-spreading , steady , calm , contemplative .</l>
       <l n="142">The sun was set , or setting , when I left</l>
       <l n="143">Our cottage door , and evening soon brought on</l>
       <l n="144">A sober hour , not winning or serene ,</l>
       <l n="145">For cold and raw the air was , and untuned ; 145</l>

       <l n="147">When sorrow damps it , or , whatever look</l>

       <l n="149">Have fulness in herself ; even so with me</l>
       <l n="150">It fared that evening . Gently did my soul 150</l>
       <l n="151">Put off her veil , and , self-transmuted , stood</l>
       <l n="152">Naked , as in the presence of her God .</l>
       <l n="153">While on I walked , a comfort seemed to touch</l>
       <l n="154">A heart that had not been disconsolate :</l>
       <l n="155">Strength came where weakness was not known to be , 155</l>
       <l n="156">At least not felt ; and restoration came</l>
       <l n="157">Like an intruder knocking at the door</l>
       <l n="158">Of unacknowledged weariness . I took</l>
       <l n="159">The balance , and with firm hand weighed myself .</l>

       <l n="165">How life pervades the undecaying mind ; 165</l>
       <l n="166">How the immortal soul with God-like power</l>
       <l n="167">Informs , creates , and thaws the deepest sleep</l>

       <l n="170">Of high endeavours , daily spreads abroad 170</l>
       <l n="171">His being armed with strength that cannot fail .</l>
       <l n="172">Nor was there want of milder thoughts , of love</l>
       <l n="173">Of innocence , and holiday repose ;</l>
       <l n="174">And more than pastoral quiet , ‘ mid the stir</l>

       <l n="392">Of a thick hawthorn , I could mark him well , 390</l>
       <l n="393">Myself unseen . He was of stature tall ,</l>
       <l n="394">A span above man 's common measure , tall ,</l>
       <l n="395">Stiff , lank , and upright ; a more meagre man</l>
       <l n="396">Was never seen before by night or day .</l>
       <l n="397">Long were his arms , pallid his hands ; his mouth 395</l>
       <l n="398">Looked ghastly in the moonlight : from behind ,</l>
       <l n="399">A mile-stone propped him ; I could also ken</l>
       <l n="400">That he was clothed in military garb ,</l>
       <l n="401">Though faded , yet entire . Companionless ,</l>
       <l n="402">No dog attending , by no staff sustained , 400</l>
       <l n="403">He stood , and in his very dress appeared</l>
       <l n="404">A desolation , a simplicity ,</l>
       <l n="405">To which the trappings of a gaudy world</l>
       <l n="406">Make a strange back-ground . From his lips , ere long ,</l>
       <l n="407">Issued low muttered sounds , as if of pain 405</l>
       <l n="408">Or some uneasy thought ; yet still his form</l>
       <l n="409">Kept the same awful steadiness — at his feet</l>
       <l n="410">His shadow lay , and moved not . From self-blame</l>
       <l n="411">Not wholly free , I watched him thus ; at length</l>
       <l n="412">Subduing my heart 's specious cowardice , 410</l>
       <l n="413">I left the shady nook where I had stood</l>
       <l n="414">And hailed him . Slowly from his resting-place</l>
       <l n="415">He rose , and with a lean and wasted arm</l>
       <l n="416">In measured gesture lifted to his head</l>
       <l n="417">Returned my salutation ; then resumed 415</l>
       <l n="418">His station as before ; and when I asked</l>
       <l n="419">His history , the veteran , in reply ,</l>
       <l n="420">Was neither slow nor eager ; but , unmoved ,</l>
       <l n="421">And with a quiet uncomplaining voice ,</l>
       <l n="422">A stately air of mild indifference , 420</l>
       <l n="423">He told in few plain words a soldier 's tale —</l>

       <l n="425">Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past :</l>
       <l n="426">That on his landing he had been dismissed ,</l>

       <l n="428">This heard , I said , in pity , “ Come with me . ”</l>
       <l n="429">He stooped , and straightway from the ground took up</l>
       <l n="430">An oaken staff by me yet unobserved —</l>
       <l n="431">A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand</l>
       <l n="432">And lay till now neglected in the grass . 430</l>
       <l n="433">Though weak his step and cautious , he appeared</l>
       <l n="434">To travel without pain , and I beheld ,</l>
       <l n="435">With an astonishment but ill suppressed ,</l>
       <l n="436">His ghostly figure moving at my side ;</l>
       <l n="437">Nor could I , while we journeyed thus , forbear 435</l>
       <l n="438">To turn from present hardships to the past ,</l>

       <l n="443">Concise in answer ; solemn and sublime</l>
       <l n="444">He might have seemed , but that in all he said</l>
       <l n="445">There was a strange half-absence , as of one</l>
       <l n="446">Knowing too well the importance of his theme ,</l>
       <l n="447">But feeling it no longer . Our discourse 445</l>
       <l n="448">Soon ended , and together on we passed</l>
       <l n="449">In silence through a wood gloomy and still .</l>
       <l n="450">Up-turning , then , along an open field ,</l>
       <l n="451">We reached a cottage . At the door I knocked ,</l>
       <l n="452">And earnestly to charitable care 450</l>
       <l n="453">Commended him as a poor friendless man ,</l>
       <l n="454">Belated and by sickness overcome .</l>
       <l n="455">Assured that now the traveller would repose</l>
       <l n="456">In comfort , I entreated that henceforth</l>
       <l n="457">He would not linger in the public ways , 455</l>
       <l n="458">But ask for timely furtherance and help</l>
       <l n="459">Such as his state required . At this reproof ,</l>
       <l n="460">With the same ghastly mildness in his look ,</l>
       <l n="461">He said , “ My trust is in the God of Heaven ,</l>
       <l n="462">And in the eye of him who passes me ! ” 460</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="10">
       <l n="463">The cottage door was speedily unbarred ,</l>

     <p>Her removal to Colthouse is confirmed , in a curious way , by a reminiscence of William Wordsworth 's ( the poet 's son ) , who told me that if asked where the dame 's house was , he would have pointed to a spot on the eastern side of the valley , and out of the village altogether ; his father having taken him from Rydal Mount to Hawkshead when a mere boy , and pointed out that spot . Doubtless Wordsworth took his son to the cottage at Colthouse , where Anne Tyson died , as the earlier abode in Hawkshead village is well known , and its site is indisputable .— Ed . ]</p>

     <p>“ Persons have visited the cottage , ” wrote Dr. Cradock , “ without discovering it ; and yet it is not forty yards distant , and is still exactly as described . On the opposite side of the lane leading to the cottage , and a few steps above it , is a narrow passage through some new stone buildings . On emerging from this , you meet a small garden , the farther side of which is bounded by the brook , confined on both sides by larger flags , and also covered by flags of the same Coniston formation , through the interstices of which you may see and hear the stream running freely . The upper flags are now used as a footpath , and lead by another passage back into the village . No doubt the garden has been reduced in size , by the use of that part of it fronting the lane for building purposes . The stream , before it enters the area of buildings and gardens , is open by the lane side , and seemingly comes from the hills to the westwards . The large flags are extremely hard and durable , and it is probably that the very flags which paved the channel in Wordsworth 's time may still be doing the same duty . ”</p>
     <p>The house adjoining this garden was not Dame Tyson 's but a Mr. Watson 's . Possibly , however , some of the boys had free access to the latter , so that Wordsworth could speak of it as “ our garden ; ” or , Dame Tyson may have rented it .

     <p>This is doubtless the streamlet called Town Beck ; and it is perhaps the most interesting of all the spots alluded to by Wordsworth which can be traced out in the Hawkshead district , I am indebted to Mr. Rawnsley for the following note :</p>
     <p>“ From the village , nay , from the poet 's very door when he lived at Anne Tyson 's , a good path leads on , past the vicarage , quite to its upland place of birth . It has eaten its way deeply into the soil ; in one place there is a series of still pools , that overflow and fall into others , with quiet sound ; at other spots , it is bustling and busy . Fine timber is found on either side of it , the roots of the trees often laid bare by the passing current . In one or two places by the side of this beck , and beneath the shadow of lofty oaks , may be found boulder stones , grey and moss-covered . Birds make hiding-places for themselves in these oak and hazel bushes by the stream . Following it up , we find it receives , at a tiny ford , the tribute of another stream from the north-west , and comes down between the adjacent hills ( well wooded to the summit ) from meadows of short-cropped grass , and to these from the open moorland , where it takes its rise . Every conceivable variety of beauty of sound and sight in streamlet life is found as we follow the course of this Town Beck . We owe much of Wordsworth 's intimate acquaintance with streamlet beauty to it . ”</p>

<note>Footnote Q : The ash tree is gone , but there is no doubt as to the place where it grew . Mr. Watson , whose father owned and inhabited the house immediately opposite to Mrs. Tyson 's cottage in Wordsworth 's time ( see a previous note ) , told me that a tall ash tree grew on the proper right front of the cottage , where an outhouse is now built . If this be so , Wordsworth 's bedroom must have been that on the proper left , with the smaller of the two windows . The cottage faces nearly south-west . In the upper flat there are two bedrooms to the front , with oak flooring , one of which must have been Wordsworth 's . See Note II .

     <p>“ All that can be safely said as to the course of that memorable morning walk is that , in that neighbourhood , a view of the sea can only be obtained at a considerable elevation ; also that if the words ‘ in front the sea lay laughing ’ are to be taken as rigidly exact , the poet 's progress towards Hawkshead must have been in a direction mainly southerly , and therefore from the country north of that place . These and all other conditions of the description are answered in several parts of the range of hills lying between Elterwater and Hawkshead . ”</p>

       <l n="50">One day , when from my lips a like complaint 50</l>
       <l n="51">Had fallen in presence of a studious friend ,</l>
       <l n="52">He with a smile made answer , that in truth</l>
       <l n="53">‘ Twas going far to seek disquietude ;</l>
       <l n="54">But on the front of his reproof confessed</l>
       <l n="55">That he himself had oftentimes given way 55</l>
       <l n="56">To kindred hauntings . Whereupon I told ,</l>
       <l n="57">That once in the stillness of a summer 's noon ,</l>
       <l n="58">While I was seated in a rocky cave</l>
       <l n="59">By the sea-side , perusing , so it chanced ,</l>
       <l n="60">The famous history of the errant knight 60</l>
       <l n="61">Recorded by Cervantes , these same thoughts</l>
       <l n="62">Beset me , and to height unusual rose ,</l>
       <l n="63">While listlessly I sate , and , having closed</l>
       <l n="64">The book , had turned my eyes toward the wide sea .</l>
       <l n="65">On poetry and geometric truth , 65</l>
       <l n="66">And their high privilege of lasting life ,</l>
       <l n="67">From all internal injury exempt ,</l>
       <l n="68">I mused , upon these chiefly : and at length ,</l>
       <l n="69">My senses yielding to the sultry air ,</l>
       <l n="70">Sleep seized me , and I passed into a dream . 70</l>
       <l n="71">I saw before me stretched a boundless plain</l>
       <l n="72">Of sandy wilderness , all black and void ,</l>
       <l n="73">And as I looked around , distress and fear</l>
       <l n="74">Came creeping over me , when at my side ,</l>
       <l n="75">Close at my side , an uncouth shape appeared 75</l>
       <l n="76">Upon a dromedary , mounted high .</l>
       <l n="77">He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes :</l>
       <l n="78">A lance he bore , and underneath one arm</l>
       <l n="79">A stone , and in the opposite hand a shell</l>
       <l n="80">Of a surpassing brightness . At the sight 80</l>
       <l n="81">Much I rejoiced , not doubting but a guide</l>
       <l n="82">Was present , one who with unerring skill</l>
       <l n="83">Would through the desert lead me ; and while yet</l>
       <l n="84">I looked and looked , self-questioned what this freight</l>
       <l n="85">Which the new-comer carried through the waste 85</l>
       <l n="86">Could mean , the Arab told me that the stone</l>
       <l n="87">( To give it in the language of the dream )</l>
       <l n="88">Was “ Euclid 's Elements ; ” and “ This , ” said he ,</l>
       <l n="89">“ Is something of more worth ; ” and at the word</l>
       <l n="90">Stretched forth the shell , so beautiful in shape , 90</l>
       <l n="91">In colour so resplendent , with command</l>
       <l n="92">That I should hold it to my ear . I did so ,</l>
       <l n="93">And heard that instant in an unknown tongue ,</l>
       <l n="94">Which yet I understood , articulate sounds ,</l>
       <l n="95">A loud prophetic blast of harmony ; 95</l>
       <l n="96">An Ode , in passion uttered , which foretold</l>
       <l n="97">Destruction to the children of the earth</l>
       <l n="98">By deluge , now at hand . No sooner ceased</l>
       <l n="99">The song , than the Arab with calm look declared</l>
       <l n="100">That all would come to pass of which the voice 100</l>
       <l n="101">Had given forewarning , and that he himself</l>
       <l n="102">Was going then to bury those two books :</l>
       <l n="103">The one that held acquaintance with the stars ,</l>
       <l n="104">And wedded soul to soul in purest bond</l>
       <l n="105">Of reason , undisturbed by space or time ; 105</l>
       <l n="106">The other that was a god , yea many gods ,</l>
       <l n="107">Had voices more than all the winds , with power</l>
       <l n="108">To exhilarate the spirit , and to soothe ,</l>
       <l n="109">Through every clime , the heart of human kind .</l>
       <l n="110">While this was uttering , strange as it may seem , 110</l>
       <l n="111">I wondered not , although I plainly saw</l>
       <l n="112">The one to be a stone , the other a shell ;</l>
       <l n="113">Nor doubted once but that they both were books ,</l>
       <l n="114">Having a perfect faith in all that passed .</l>
       <l n="115">Far stronger , now , grew the desire I felt 115</l>
       <l n="116">To cleave unto this man ; but when I prayed</l>
       <l n="117">To share his enterprise , he hurried on</l>
       <l n="118">Reckless of me : I followed , not unseen ,</l>
       <l n="119">For oftentimes he cast a backward look ,</l>
       <l n="120">Grasping his twofold treasure .— Lance in rest , 120</l>
       <l n="121">He rode , I keeping pace with him ; and now</l>
       <l n="122">He , to my fancy , had become the knight</l>
       <l n="123">Whose tale Cervantes tells ; yet not the knight ,</l>
       <l n="124">But was an Arab of the desert too ;</l>
       <l n="125">Of these was neither , and was both at once . 125</l>
       <l n="126">His countenance , meanwhile , grew more disturbed ;</l>
       <l n="127">And , looking backwards when he looked , mine eyes</l>
       <l n="128">Saw , over half the wilderness diffused ,</l>
       <l n="129">A bed of glittering light : I asked the cause :</l>
       <l n="130">“ It is , ” said he , “ the waters of the deep 130</l>
       <l n="131">Gathering upon us ; ” quickening then the pace</l>
       <l n="132">Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode ,</l>
       <l n="133">He left me : I called after him aloud ;</l>
       <l n="134">He heeded not ; but , with his twofold charge</l>
       <l n="135">Still in his grasp , before me , full in view , 135</l>
       <l n="136">Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste ,</l>
       <l n="137">With the fleet waters of a drowning world</l>
       <l n="138">In chase of him ; whereat I waked in terror ,</l>

Duffield , the translator of Don Quixote , wrote me the following letter on Wordsworth and Cervantes , which I transcribe in full .</note>
     <p>“ So far as I can learn Wordsworth had not read any critical work on Don Quixote before he wrote the fifth book of ‘ The Prelude ’ , [ a ] nor for that matter had any criticism of the master-piece of Cervantes then appeared . Yet Wordsworth ,</p>
     <p>‘ by patient exercise Of study and hard thought , ’</p>
     <p>has given us not only a most poetical insight into the real nature of the ‘ Illustrious Hidalgo of La Mancha ’ ; he has shown us that it was a nature compacted of the madman and the poet , and this in language so appropriate , that the consideration of it cannot fail to give pleasure to all who have found a reason for weighing Wordsworth 's words .</p>

       <l n="3">then falls asleep , ‘ his senses yielding to the sultry air , ’ and he</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="5">‘ stretched a boundless plain</l>
       <l n="6">Of sandy wilderness , all black and void ,</l>
       <l n="7">And as I looked around , distress and fear</l>
       <l n="8">Came creeping over me , when at my side ,</l>
       <l n="9">Close at my side , an uncouth shape appeared</l>
       <l n="10">Upon a dromedary , mounted high .</l>
       <l n="11">He seemed an Arab ... ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Here we have the plains of Montiel , and the poet realising all that Don Quixote felt on that day of July , ‘ the hottest of the year , ’ when he first set out on his quest and met with nothing worth recording .</p>
     <p>‘ The uncouth shape ’</p>
     <p>is of course the Don himself ,</p>
     <p>the ‘ dromedary ’</p>
     <p>is Rozinante , and</p>
     <p>the ‘ Arab ’</p>
     <p>doubtless is Cid Hamete Benengeli .</p>
     <p>“ Taking such an one for the guide ,</p>
     <p>‘ who with unerring skill Would through the desert lead me , ’</p>
     <p>is a most sweet play of humour like to the lambent flame of his whose satire was as a summer breath , and who smiled all the time he wrote , although he wrote chiefly in a prison .</p>
     <p>‘ The loud prophetic blast of harmony ’</p>
     <p>is doubtless a continuation of this humour , down to the lines</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ Nor doubted once but that they both were books ,</l>
       <l n="2">Having a perfect faith in all that passed . ’</l>

       <l n="3">“ Our poet now becomes positive ,</l>

       <l n="7">Whose tale Cervantes tells ; yet not the knight</l>
       <l n="8">But was an Arab of the desert too ,</l>
       <l n="9">Of these was neither , and was both at once . ’</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>This is absolutely true , and was one of the earliest complaints made a century and a half ago , when Spaniards began to criticise their one great book . They could not tell at times whether Don Quixote was speaking , or Cervantes , or Cid Hamete Benengeli .</p>
     <p>‘ A bed of glittering light ’</p>
     <p>is a delightful description of the attitude of Don Quixote 's mind towards external nature while passing through the desert .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ It is , ’ said he , ‘ the waters of the deep</l>
       <l n="2">Gathering upon us . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ It was , of course , only the mirage ; but this he changed to suit his own purpose into the ‘ waters of the deep , ’ as he changed the row of Castilian wind-mills into giants , and the roar of the fulling mills into the din of war .</p>
     <p>“ Wordsworth is now awake from his dream , but turning all he saw in it into a reality , as only the poet can , he feels that</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Reverence was due to a being thus employed ;</l>
       <l n="2">And thought that , in the blind and awful lair</l>
       <l n="3">Of such a madness , reason did lie couched . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Here again is a most profound description of the creation of Cervantes . Don Quixote was mad , but his was a madness that proceeded from that ‘ blind and awful lair , ’ a disordered stomach , rather than from an injured brain . Had Don Quixote not forsaken the exercise of the chase and early rising , if he had not taken to eating chestnuts at night , cold spiced meat , together with onions and ‘ ollas podridas ’ , then proceeding to read exciting , unnatural tales of love and war , he would not have gone mad .</p>
     <p>“ But his reason only lay ‘ couched , ’ not overthrown . Only give him a dose of the balsam of Fierabras , his reason shall spring out of its lair , like a lion from out its hiding-place , as indeed it did ; and you then have that wonderful piece of rhetoric , which describes the army of Alifanfaron in the eighteenth chapter , Part I .</p>
     <p>“ There are many other things worthy of note , such as</p>
     <p>‘ crazed By love and feeling , and internal thought Protracted among endless solitudes , ’</p>
     <p>all of which are ‘ fit epithets blessed in the marriage of pure words , ’ which the author of ‘ The Prelude ’ , without any special learning , or personal knowledge of Spain , has given us , and are so striking as to compel us once again to go to Wordsworth and say , ‘ we do not all understand thee yet , not all that thou hast given us . ’</p>

     <p>“ Of my earliest days at School I have little to say , but that they were very happy ones , chiefly because I was left at liberty , then and in the vacations , to read whatever books I liked . For example , I read all Fielding 's works , ‘ Don Quixote ’ , ‘ Gil Blas ’ , and any part of Swift that I liked ; ‘ Gulliver 's Travels ’ and the ‘ Tale of a Tub ’ being both much to my taste . ”</p>
     <p>As Wordsworth alludes to Coleridge 's education , along with his own , “ in the season of unperilous choice , ” the reference is probably to Coleridge 's early time at the vicarage of Ottery St. Mary 's , Devonshire , and at the Grammar School there , as well as at Christ 's Hospital in London , where ( with Charles Lamb as school-companion ) he was as enthusiastic in his exploits in the New River , as he was an eager student of books .— Ed . ]</p>

<note>Footnote M : Hawkshead School , in which Wordsworth was taught for eight years — from 1778 to 1786 — was founded by Archbishop Sandys of York , in 1585 , and the building is still very much as it was in Wordsworth 's time . The main school-room is on the ground floor . One small chamber on the first floor was used , in the end of last century , by the head master , as a private class-room , for teaching a few advanced pupils . In another is a small library , formed in part by the donations of the scholars ; it having been a custom for each pupil to present a volume on leaving the school , or to send one afterwards . Very probably one of the volumes now in the library was presented by Wordsworth . There are several which were presented by his school-fellows , during the years in which Wordsworth was at Hawkshead . The master , in 1877 , promised me that he would search through his somewhat musty treasures , to see if he could discover a book with the poet 's autograph ; but I never heard of his success . On the wall of the room containing the library is a tablet , recording the names of several masters . There also , in an old oak chest , is kept the original charter of the school . The oak benches downstairs are covered with the names or initials of the boys , deeply cut ; and , amongst them , the name of William Wordsworth — but not those of his brothers Richard , John , or Christopher — may be seen . For further details as to the Hawkshead School , see the ‘ Life ’ of the Poet in this edition .

      <head>BOOK SEVENTH</head>
      <head>RESIDENCE IN LONDON</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Six changeful years have vanished since I first</l>
       <l n="2">Poured out ( saluted by that quickening breeze</l>
       <l n="3">Which met me issuing from the City 's [ A ] walls )</l>
       <l n="4">A glad preamble to this Verse : [ B ] I sang</l>
       <l n="5">Aloud , with fervour irresistible 5</l>
       <l n="6">Of short-lived transport , like a torrent bursting ,</l>
       <l n="7">From a black thunder-cloud , down Scafell 's side</l>
       <l n="8">To rush and disappear . But soon broke forth</l>
       <l n="9">( So willed the Muse ) a less impetuous stream ,</l>
       <l n="10">That flowed awhile with unabating strength , 10</l>
       <l n="11">Then stopped for years ; not audible again</l>
       <l n="12">Before last primrose-time , [ C ] Beloved Friend !</l>
       <l n="13">The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts</l>
       <l n="14">On thy departure to a foreign land [ D ]</l>
       <l n="15">Has failed ; too slowly moves the promised work . 15</l>
       <l n="16">Through the whole summer have I been at rest , [ E ]</l>
       <l n="17">Partly from voluntary holiday ,</l>
       <l n="18">And part through outward hindrance . But I heard ,</l>
       <l n="19">After the hour of sunset yester-even ,</l>
       <l n="20">Sitting within doors between light and dark , 20</l>
       <l n="21">A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near</l>
       <l n="22">My threshold ,— minstrels from the distant woods</l>
       <l n="23">Sent in on Winter 's service , to announce ,</l>
       <l n="24">With preparation artful and benign ,</l>
       <l n="25">That the rough lord had left the surly North 25</l>
       <l n="26">On his accustomed journey . The delight ,</l>
       <l n="27">Due to this timely notice , unawares</l>
       <l n="28">Smote me , and , listening , I in whispers said ,</l>
       <l n="29">“ Ye heartsome Choristers , ye and I will be</l>
       <l n="30">Associates , and , unscared by blustering winds , 30</l>
       <l n="31">Will chant together . ” Thereafter , as the shades</l>
       <l n="32">Of twilight deepened , going forth , I spied</l>
       <l n="33">A glow-worm underneath a dusky plume</l>
       <l n="34">Or canopy of yet unwithered fern ,</l>
       <l n="35">Clear-shining , like a hermit 's taper seen 35</l>
       <l n="36">Through a thick forest . Silence touched me here</l>
       <l n="37">No less than sound had done before ; the child</l>
       <l n="38">Of Summer , lingering , shining , by herself ,</l>
       <l n="39">The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills ,</l>
       <l n="40">Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir 40</l>
       <l n="41">Of Winter that had warbled at my door ,</l>
       <l n="42">And the whole year breathed tenderness and love .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="43">The last night 's genial feeling overflowed</l>
       <l n="44">Upon this morning , and my favourite grove ,</l>
       <l n="45">Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft , [ F ] 45</l>
       <l n="46">As if to make the strong wind visible ,</l>
       <l n="47">Wakes in me agitations like its own ,</l>
       <l n="48">A spirit friendly to the Poet 's task ,</l>
       <l n="49">Which we will now resume with lively hope ,</l>

       <l n="52">Returned from that excursion , [ G ] soon I bade</l>
       <l n="53">Farewell for ever to the sheltered seats [ H ]</l>
       <l n="54">Of gownèd students , quitted hall and bower ,</l>
       <l n="55">And every comfort of that privileged ground , 55</l>
       <l n="56">Well pleased to pitch a vagrant tent among</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="58">Yet , undetermined to what course of life</l>

       <l n="60">A little space of intermediate time 60</l>
       <l n="61">At full command , to London first I turned , [ I ]</l>
       <l n="62">In no disturbance of excessive hope ,</l>
       <l n="63">By personal ambition unenslaved ,</l>
       <l n="64">Frugal as there was need , and , though self-willed ,</l>
       <l n="65">From dangerous passions free . Three years had flown [ K ] 65</l>
       <l n="66">Since I had felt in heart and soul the shock</l>
       <l n="67">Of the huge town 's first presence , and had paced</l>
       <l n="68">Her endless streets , a transient visitant : [ K ]</l>
       <l n="69">Now , fixed amid that concourse of mankind</l>
       <l n="70">Where Pleasure whirls about incessantly , 70</l>
       <l n="71">And life and labour seem but one , I filled</l>
       <l n="72">An idler 's place ; an idler well content</l>
       <l n="73">To have a house ( what matter for a home ? )</l>
       <l n="74">That owned him ; living cheerfully abroad</l>
       <l n="75">With unchecked fancy ever on the stir , 75</l>
       <l n="76">And all my young affections out of doors .</l>

       <l n="84">Among Tartarian wilds — fell short , far short ,</l>
       <l n="85">Of what my fond simplicity believed 85</l>
       <l n="86">And thought of London — held me by a chain</l>
       <l n="87">Less strong of wonder and obscure delight .</l>

       <l n="93">And envied traveller ! When the Boy returned ,</l>
       <l n="94">After short absence , curiously I scanned</l>
       <l n="95">His mien and person , nor was free , in sooth , 95</l>
       <l n="96">From disappointment , not to find some change</l>
       <l n="97">In look and air , from that new region brought ,</l>
       <l n="98">As if from Fairy-land . Much I questioned him ;</l>
       <l n="99">And every word he uttered , on my ears</l>
       <l n="100">Fell flatter than a cagèd parrot 's note , 100</l>
       <l n="101">That answers unexpectedly awry ,</l>
       <l n="102">And mocks the prompter 's listening . Marvellous things</l>

       <l n="105">In a Child 's heart as fear itself ) conceived 105</l>
       <l n="106">For my enjoyment . Would that I could now</l>
       <l n="107">Recal what then I pictured to myself ,</l>
       <l n="108">Of mitred Prelates , Lords in ermine clad ,</l>
       <l n="109">The King , and the King 's Palace , and , not last ,</l>

       <l n="114">Sate on a stone , and heard the bells speak out</l>
       <l n="115">Articulate music . [ L ] Above all , one thought 115</l>
       <l n="116">Baffled my understanding : how men lived</l>

     <p>“ As we were going along , we were stopped at once , at the distance perhaps of fifty yards from our favourite birch tree . It was yielding to the gusty wind with all its tender twigs . The sun shone upon it , and it glanced in the wind like a flying sunshiny shower . It was a tree in shape , with stem and branches , but it was like a spirit of water . The sun went in , and it resumed its purplish appearance , the twigs still yielding to the wind , but not so visibly to us . The other birch trees that were near it looked bright and cheerful , but it was a Creation by itself amongst them . ”</p>

       <l n="220">Ungovernable , and your terrifying winds , 220</l>

       <l n="223">There , ‘ tis the shepherd 's task the winter long</l>
       <l n="224">To wait upon the storms : of their approach</l>
       <l n="225">Sagacious , into sheltering coves he drives 225</l>
       <l n="226">His flock , and thither from the homestead bears</l>
       <l n="227">A toilsome burden up the craggy ways ,</l>
       <l n="228">And deals it out , their regular nourishment</l>
       <l n="229">Strewn on the frozen snow . And when the spring</l>
       <l n="230">Looks out , and all the pastures dance with lambs , 230</l>
       <l n="231">And when the flock , with warmer weather , climbs</l>
       <l n="232">Higher and higher , him his office leads</l>
       <l n="233">To watch their goings , whatsoever track</l>
       <l n="234">The wanderers choose . For this he quits his home</l>

       <l n="239">As is their wont , a pittance from strict time ,</l>
       <l n="240">For rest not needed or exchange of love , 240</l>
       <l n="241">Then from his couch he starts ; and now his feet</l>
       <l n="242">Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers</l>
       <l n="243">Of lowly thyme , by Nature 's skill enwrought</l>
       <l n="244">In the wild turf : the lingering dews of morn</l>
       <l n="245">Smoke round him , as from hill to hill he hies , 245</l>
       <l n="246">His staff protending like a hunter 's spear ,</l>
       <l n="247">Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag ,</l>
       <l n="248">And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams .</l>
       <l n="249">Philosophy , methinks , at Fancy 's call ,</l>
       <l n="250">Might deign to follow him through what he does 250</l>
       <l n="251">Or sees in his day 's march ; himself he feels ,</l>
       <l n="252">In those vast regions where his service lies ,</l>
       <l n="253">A freeman , wedded to his life of hope</l>
       <l n="254">And hazard , and hard labour interchanged</l>
       <l n="255">With that majestic indolence so dear 255</l>
       <l n="256">To native man . A rambling school-boy , thus</l>
       <l n="257">I felt his presence in his own domain ,</l>
       <l n="258">As of a lord and master , or a power ,</l>
       <l n="259">Or genius , under Nature , under God ,</l>
       <l n="260">Presiding ; and severest solitude 260</l>
       <l n="261">Had more commanding looks when he was there .</l>
       <l n="262">When up the lonely brooks on rainy days</l>
       <l n="263">Angling I went , or trod the trackless hills</l>
       <l n="264">By mists bewildered , [ X ] suddenly mine eyes</l>
       <l n="265">Have glanced upon him distant a few steps , 265</l>
       <l n="266">In size a giant , stalking through thick fog ,</l>
       <l n="267">His sheep like Greenland bears ; or , as he stepped</l>
       <l n="268">Beyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow ,</l>
       <l n="269">His form hath flashed upon me , glorified</l>
       <l n="270">By the deep radiance of the setting sun : 270</l>
       <l n="271">Or him have I descried in distant sky ,</l>
       <l n="272">A solitary object and sublime ,</l>
       <l n="273">Above all height ! like an aerial cross</l>
       <l n="274">Stationed alone upon a spiry rock</l>
       <l n="275">Of the Chartreuse , for worship . [ Y ] Thus was man 275</l>
       <l n="276">Ennobled outwardly before my sight ,</l>
       <l n="277">And thus my heart was early introduced</l>
       <l n="278">To an unconscious love and reverence</l>
       <l n="279">Of human nature ; hence the human form</l>
       <l n="280">To me became an index of delight , 280</l>
       <l n="281">Of grace and honour , power and worthiness .</l>
       <l n="282">Meanwhile this creature — spiritual almost</l>
       <l n="283">As those of books , but more exalted far ;</l>
       <l n="284">Far more of an imaginative form</l>
       <l n="285">Than the gay Corin of the groves , [ Z ] who lives 285</l>
       <l n="286">For his own fancies , or to dance by the hour ,</l>
       <l n="287">In coronal , with Phyllis in the midst — [ Z ]</l>
       <l n="288">Was , for the purposes of kind , a man</l>
       <l n="289">With the most common ; husband , father ; learned ,</l>
       <l n="290">Could teach , admonish ; suffered with the rest 290</l>
       <l n="291">From vice and folly , wretchedness and fear ;</l>
       <l n="292">Of this I little saw , cared less for it ,</l>
       <l n="293">But something must have felt .</l>
       <l n="294">Call ye these appearances</l>
       <l n="295">Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth ,</l>
       <l n="296">This sanctity of Nature given to man , 295</l>
       <l n="297">A shadow , a delusion ? ye who pore</l>
       <l n="298">On the dead letter , miss the spirit of things ;</l>
       <l n="299">Whose truth is not a motion or a shape</l>
       <l n="300">Instinct with vital functions , but a block</l>
       <l n="301">Or waxen image which yourselves have made , 300</l>
       <l n="302">And ye adore ! But blessed be the God</l>
       <l n="303">Of Nature and of Man that this was so ;</l>
       <l n="304">That men before my inexperienced eyes</l>
       <l n="305">Did first present themselves thus purified ,</l>
       <l n="306">Removed , and to a distance that was fit : 305</l>
       <l n="307">And so we all of us in some degree</l>
       <l n="308">Are led to knowledge , wheresoever led ,</l>
       <l n="309">And howsoever ; were it otherwise ,</l>
       <l n="310">And we found evil fast as we find good</l>
       <l n="311">In our first years , or think that it is found , 310</l>
       <l n="312">How could the innocent heart bear up and live !</l>
       <l n="313">But doubly fortunate my lot ; not here</l>
       <l n="314">Alone , that something of a better life</l>
       <l n="315">Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege</l>
       <l n="316">Of most to move in , but that first I looked 315</l>
       <l n="317">At Man through objects that were great or fair ;</l>
       <l n="318">First communed with him by their help . And thus</l>
       <l n="319">Was founded a sure safeguard and defence</l>
       <l n="320">Against the weight of meanness , selfish cares ,</l>
       <l n="321">Coarse manners , vulgar passions , that beat in 320</l>
       <l n="322">On all sides from the ordinary world</l>
       <l n="323">In which we traffic . Starting from this point</l>
       <l n="324">I had my face turned toward the truth , began</l>
       <l n="325">With an advantage furnished by that kind</l>
       <l n="326">Of prepossession , without which the soul 325</l>

       <l n="328">No genuine insight ever comes to her .</l>
       <l n="329">From the restraint of over-watchful eyes</l>
       <l n="330">Preserved , I moved about , year after year ,</l>
       <l n="331">Happy , [ a ] and now most thankful that my walk 330</l>
       <l n="332">Was guarded from too early intercourse</l>
       <l n="333">With the deformities of crowded life ,</l>
       <l n="334">And those ensuing laughters and contempts ,</l>
       <l n="335">Self-pleasing , which , if we would wish to think</l>

<note>Footnote f : It is difficult to say where this “ smooth rock wet with constant springs ” and the “ copse-clad bank ” were . There is no copse-clad bank fronting Anne Tyson 's cottage at Hawkshead . It may have been a rock on the wooded slope of the rounded hill that rises west of Cowper Ground , north-west of Hawkshead . A rock “ wet with springs ” existed there , till it was quarried for road-metal a few years since . But it is quite possible that the cottage referred to is Dove Cottage , Grasmere . In that case the “ rock ” and “ copse-clad bank ” may have been on Loughrigg , or more probably on Silver How . The “ summer sun ” goes down behind Silver How , so that it might smite a wet rock either on Hammar Scar or on the wooded crags above Red Bank . These could be seen from the window of one of the rooms of Dove Cottage . Seated beside the hearth of the “ half-kitchen and half-parlour fire ” in that cottage , and looking along the passage through the low door , the eye would rest on Hammar Scar , the wooded hill behind Allan Bank . The context of the poem points to Hawkshead ; but the details of the description suggest the Grasmere cottage rather than Anne Tyson 's .— Ed .</note>     <note xml:id="notef_3" place="bottom" n="f">It is difficult to say where this “ smooth rock wet with constant springs ” and the “ copse-clad bank ” were .

In that case the “ rock ” and “ copse-clad bank ” may have been on Loughrigg , or more probably on Silver How . The “ summer sun ” goes down behind Silver How , so that it might smite a wet rock either on Hammar Scar or on the wooded crags above Red Bank . These could be seen from the window of one of the rooms of Dove Cottage . Seated beside the hearth of the “ half-kitchen and half-parlour fire ” in that cottage , and looking along the passage through the low door , the eye would rest on Hammar Scar , the wooded hill behind Allan Bank . The context of the poem points to Hawkshead ; but the details of the description suggest the Grasmere cottage rather than Anne Tyson 's .— Ed .</note>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The beautiful image with which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while I was resting in a boat along with my companions under the shade of a magnificent row of sycamores , which then extended their branches from the shore of the promontory upon with stands the ancient , and at that time the more picturesque , Hall of Coniston . ”</p>
     <p>There is nothing in either poem definitely to connect “ Thurstonmere ” with Coniston , although their identity is suggested by the Fenwick note . I find , however , that Thurston was the ancient name of Coniston ; and this carries us back to the time of the worship of Thor . ( See Lewis 's ‘ Topographical Dictionary of England ’ , vol . i. p. 662 ; also the ‘ Edinburgh Gazetteer ’ ( 1822 ) , articles “ Thurston ” and “ Coniston . ” ) The site of the grove “ on the shore of the promontory ” at Coniston Lake is easily identified , but the grove itself is gone .— Ed . ]</p>

       <l n="2">It was a beautiful and silent day</l>
       <l n="3">That overspread the countenance of earth ,</l>
       <l n="4">Then fading with unusual quietness ,—</l>
       <l n="5">A day as beautiful as e'er was given</l>
       <l n="6">To soothe regret , though deepening what it soothed , 5</l>
       <l n="7">When by the gliding Loire I paused , and cast</l>
       <l n="8">Upon his rich domains , vineyard and tilth ,</l>
       <l n="9">Green meadow-ground , and many-coloured woods ,</l>
       <l n="10">Again , and yet again , a farewell look ;</l>
       <l n="11">Then from the quiet of that scene passed on , 10</l>
       <l n="12">Bound to the fierce Metropolis . [ A ] From his throne</l>
       <l n="13">The King had fallen , [ B ] and that invading host —</l>
       <l n="14">Presumptuous cloud , on whose black front was written</l>
       <l n="15">The tender mercies of the dismal wind</l>
       <l n="16">That bore it — on the plains of Liberty 15</l>
       <l n="17">Had burst innocuous . Say in bolder words ,</l>
       <l n="18">They — who had come elate as eastern hunters</l>
       <l n="19">Banded beneath the Great Mogul , when he</l>
       <l n="20">Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore ,</l>
       <l n="21">Rajahs and Omrahs [ C ] in his train , intent 20</l>
       <l n="22">To drive their prey enclosed within a ring</l>
       <l n="23">Wide as a province , but , the signal given ,</l>
       <l n="24">Before the point of the life-threatening spear</l>
       <l n="25">Narrowing itself by moments — they , rash men ,</l>
       <l n="26">Had seen the anticipated quarry turned 25</l>
       <l n="27">Into avengers , from whose wrath they fled</l>
       <l n="28">In terror . Disappointment and dismay</l>
       <l n="29">Remained for all whose fancies had run wild</l>
       <l n="30">With evil expectations ; confidence</l>
       <l n="31">And perfect triumph for the better cause . 30</l>

       <l n="32">The State , as if to stamp the final seal</l>

       <l n="35">Exulting in defiance , or heart-stung</l>
       <l n="36">By sharp resentment , or belike to taunt 35</l>
       <l n="37">With spiteful gratitude the baffled League ,</l>
       <l n="38">That had stirred up her slackening faculties</l>
       <l n="39">To a new transition , when the King was crushed ,</l>
       <l n="40">Spared not the empty throne , and in proud haste</l>
       <l n="41">Assumed the body and venerable name 40</l>
       <l n="42">Of a Republic . [ D ] Lamentable crimes ,</l>
       <l n="43">‘ Tis true , had gone before this hour , dire work</l>
       <l n="44">Of massacre , [ E ] in which the senseless sword</l>
       <l n="45">Was prayed to as a judge ; but these were past ,</l>
       <l n="46">Earth free from them for ever , as was thought ,— 45</l>

       <l n="49">Cheered with this hope , to Paris I returned , [ F ]</l>
       <l n="50">And ranged , with ardour heretofore unfelt ,</l>
       <l n="51">The spacious city , and in progress passed 50</l>
       <l n="52">The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay ,</l>
       <l n="53">Associate with his children and his wife</l>
       <l n="54">In bondage ; and the palace , lately stormed</l>
       <l n="55">With roar of cannon by a furious host .</l>
       <l n="56">I crossed the square ( an empty area then ! ) [ G ] 55</l>
       <l n="57">Of the Carrousel , where so late had lain</l>
       <l n="58">The dead , upon the dying heaped , and gazed</l>
       <l n="59">On this and other spots , as doth a man</l>
       <l n="60">Upon a volume whose contents he knows</l>
       <l n="61">Are memorable , but from him locked up , 60</l>
       <l n="62">Being written in a tongue he cannot read ,</l>
       <l n="63">So that he questions the mute leaves with pain ,</l>
       <l n="64">And half upbraids their silence . But that night</l>
       <l n="65">I felt most deeply in what world I was ,</l>
       <l n="66">What ground I trod on , and what air I breathed . 65</l>
       <l n="67">High was my room and lonely , near the roof</l>
       <l n="68">Of a large mansion or hotel , a lodge</l>
       <l n="69">That would have pleased me in more quiet times ;</l>
       <l n="70">Nor was it wholly without pleasure then .</l>
       <l n="71">With unextinguished taper I kept watch , 70</l>
       <l n="72">Reading at intervals ; the fear gone by</l>
       <l n="73">Pressed on me almost like a fear to come .</l>
       <l n="74">I thought of those September massacres ,</l>
       <l n="75">Divided from me by one little month , [ H ]</l>
       <l n="76">Saw them and touched : the rest was conjured up 75</l>
       <l n="77">From tragic fictions or true history ,</l>
       <l n="78">Remembrances and dim admonishments .</l>
       <l n="79">The horse is taught his manage , and no star</l>
       <l n="80">Of wildest course but treads back his own steps ;</l>
       <l n="81">For the spent hurricane the air provides 80</l>
       <l n="82">As fierce a successor ; the tide retreats</l>
       <l n="83">But to return out of its hiding-place</l>
       <l n="84">In the great deep ; all things have second-birth ;</l>
       <l n="85">The earthquake is not satisfied at once ;</l>
       <l n="86">And in this way I wrought upon myself , 85</l>
       <l n="87">Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried ,</l>
       <l n="88">To the whole city , “ Sleep no more . ” The trance</l>
       <l n="89">Fled with the voice to which it had given birth ;</l>
       <l n="90">But vainly comments of a calmer mind</l>
       <l n="91">Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness . 90</l>
       <l n="92">The place , all hushed and silent as it was ,</l>
       <l n="93">Appeared unfit for the repose of night ,</l>
       <l n="94">Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam .</l>

       <l n="95">With early morning towards the Palace-walk</l>
       <l n="96">Of Orléans eagerly I turned ; as yet 95</l>
       <l n="97">The streets were still ; not so those long Arcades ;</l>
       <l n="98">There , ‘ mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries ,</l>
       <l n="99">That greeted me on entering , I could hear</l>
       <l n="100">Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng ,</l>
       <l n="101">Bawling , “ Denunciation of the Crimes 100</l>
       <l n="102">Of Maximilian Robespierre ; ” the hand ,</l>
       <l n="103">Prompt as the voice , held forth a printed speech ,</l>
       <l n="104">The same that had been recently pronounced ,</l>
       <l n="105">When Robespierre , not ignorant for what mark</l>
       <l n="106">Some words of indirect reproof had been 105</l>
       <l n="107">Intended , rose in hardihood , and dared</l>
       <l n="108">The man who had an ill surmise of him</l>
       <l n="109">To bring his charge in openness ; whereat ,</l>
       <l n="110">When a dead pause ensued , and no one stirred ,</l>
       <l n="111">In silence of all present , from his seat 110</l>
       <l n="112">Louvet walked single through the avenue ,</l>
       <l n="113">And took his station in the Tribune , saying ,</l>
       <l n="114">“ I , Robespierre , accuse thee ! ” [ I ] Well is known</l>
       <l n="115">The inglorious issue of that charge , and how</l>
       <l n="116">He , who had launched the startling thunderbolt , 115</l>
       <l n="117">The one bold man , whose voice the attack had sounded ,</l>
       <l n="118">Was left without a follower to discharge</l>
       <l n="119">His perilous duty , and retire lamenting</l>
       <l n="120">That Heaven 's best aid is wasted upon men</l>
       <l n="121">Who to themselves are false . [ K ]</l>
       <l n="122">But these are things 120</l>
       <l n="123">Of which I speak , only as they were storm</l>
       <l n="124">Or sunshine to my individual mind ,</l>
       <l n="125">No further . Let me then relate that now —</l>
       <l n="126">In some sort seeing with my proper eyes</l>
       <l n="127">That Liberty , and Life , and Death would soon 125</l>

       <l n="129">Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled</l>
       <l n="130">The capital City ; what was struggled for ,</l>
       <l n="131">And by what combatants victory must be won ;</l>
       <l n="132">The indecision on their part whose aim 130</l>
       <l n="133">Seemed best , and the straightforward path of those</l>
       <l n="134">Who in attack or in defence were strong</l>
       <l n="135">Through their impiety — my inmost soul</l>
       <l n="136">Was agitated ; yea , I could almost</l>
       <l n="137">Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men , 135</l>
       <l n="138">By patient exercise of reason made</l>
       <l n="139">Worthy of liberty , all spirits filled</l>

       <l n="141">The gift of tongues might fall , and power arrive</l>
       <l n="142">From the four quarters of the winds to do 140</l>
       <l n="143">For France , what without help she could not do ,</l>

       <l n="148">Yet did I grieve , nor only grieved , but thought</l>
       <l n="149">Of opposition and of remedies :</l>
       <l n="150">An insignificant stranger and obscure ,</l>
       <l n="151">And one , moreover , little graced with power</l>
       <l n="152">Of eloquence even in my native speech , 150</l>

       <l n="155">Have undertaken for a cause so great</l>
       <l n="156">Service however dangerous . I revolved ,</l>
       <l n="157">How much the destiny of Man had still 155</l>
       <l n="158">Hung upon single persons ; that there was ,</l>
       <l n="159">Transcendent to all local patrimony ,</l>
       <l n="160">One nature , as there is one sun in heaven ;</l>
       <l n="161">That objects , even as they are great , thereby</l>
       <l n="162">Do come within the reach of humblest eyes ; 160</l>
       <l n="163">That Man is only weak through his mistrust</l>
       <l n="164">And want of hope where evidence divine</l>
       <l n="165">Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure ;</l>
       <l n="166">Nor did the inexperience of my youth</l>
       <l n="167">Preclude conviction , that a spirit strong , 165</l>
       <l n="168">In hope , and trained to noble aspirations ,</l>
       <l n="169">A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself ,</l>
       <l n="170">Is for Society 's unreasoning herd</l>
       <l n="171">A domineering instinct , serves at once</l>
       <l n="172">For way and guide , a fluent receptacle 170</l>
       <l n="173">That gathers up each petty straggling rill</l>
       <l n="174">And vein of water , glad to be rolled on</l>
       <l n="175">In safe obedience ; that a mind , whose rest</l>
       <l n="176">Is where it ought to be , in self-restraint ,</l>
       <l n="177">In circumspection and simplicity , 175</l>
       <l n="178">Falls rarely in entire discomfiture</l>
       <l n="179">Below its aim , or meets with , from without ,</l>
       <l n="180">A treachery that foils it or defeats ;</l>
       <l n="181">And , lastly , if the means on human will ,</l>
       <l n="182">Frail human will , dependent should betray 180</l>
       <l n="183">Him who too boldly trusted them , I felt</l>

<note>Footnote I :</note>     <p>“ One day , among the last of October , Robespierre , being summoned to the tribune by some new hint of that old calumny of the Dictatorship , was speaking and pleading there , with more and more comfort to himself ; till rising high in heart , he cried out valiantly : Is there any man here that dare specifically accuse me ? ‘'Moi ! ' ’ exclaimed one . Pause of deep silence : a lean angry little Figure , with broad bald brow , strode swiftly towards the tribune , taking papers from its pocket : ‘ I accuse thee , Robespierre ,— I , Jean Baptiste Louvet ! ’ The Seagreen became tallow-green ; shrinking to a corner of the tribune , Danton cried , ‘ Speak , Robespierre ; there are many good citizens that listen ; ’ but the tongue refused its office . And so Louvet , with a shrill tone , read and recited crime after crime : dictatorial temper , exclusive popularity , bullying at elections , mob-retinue , September Massacres ;— till all the Convention shrieked again , ” etc . etc .</p>

       <l n="234">I led my horse , and , stumbling on , at length</l>
       <l n="235">Came to a bottom , where in former times 235</l>

       <l n="244">The grass is cleared away , and to this hour</l>
       <l n="245">The characters are fresh and visible : 245</l>
       <l n="246">A casual glance had shown them , and I fled ,</l>

       <l n="248">Then , reascending the bare common , saw</l>
       <l n="249">A naked pool that lay beneath the hills ,</l>
       <l n="250">The beacon on the summit , and , more near , 250</l>
       <l n="251">A girl , who bore a pitcher on her head ,</l>
       <l n="252">And seemed with difficult steps to force her way</l>

       <l n="254">An ordinary sight ; but I should need</l>
       <l n="255">Colours and words that are unknown to man , 255</l>

       <l n="260">The female and her garments vexed and tossed 260</l>
       <l n="261">By the strong wind . When , in the blessed hours</l>
       <l n="262">Of early love , the loved one at my side , [ E ]</l>
       <l n="263">I roamed , in daily presence of this scene ,</l>

       <l n="296">Thither , uncertain on which road to fix 295</l>
       <l n="297">My expectation , thither I repaired ,</l>
       <l n="298">Scout-like , and gained the summit ; ‘ twas a day</l>
       <l n="299">Tempestuous , dark , and wild , and on the grass</l>
       <l n="300">I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall ;</l>
       <l n="301">Upon my right hand couched a single sheep , 300</l>
       <l n="302">Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood ;</l>
       <l n="303">With those companions at my side , I watched ,</l>
       <l n="304">Straining my eyes intensely , as the mist</l>
       <l n="305">Gave intermitting prospect of the copse</l>
       <l n="306">And plain beneath . Ere we to school returned ,— 305</l>
       <l n="307">That dreary time ,— ere we had been ten days</l>
       <l n="308">Sojourners in my father 's house , he died ,</l>
       <l n="309">And I and my three brothers , orphans then ,</l>
       <l n="310">Followed his body to the grave . The event ,</l>
       <l n="311">With all the sorrow that it brought , appeared 310</l>
       <l n="312">A chastisement ; and when I called to mind</l>
       <l n="313">That day so lately past , when from the crag</l>
       <l n="314">I looked in such anxiety of hope ;</l>
       <l n="315">With trite reflections of morality ,</l>
       <l n="316">Yet in the deepest passion , I bowed low 315</l>
       <l n="317">To God , Who thus corrected my desires ;</l>
       <l n="318">And , afterwards , the wind and sleety rain ,</l>
       <l n="319">And all the business of the elements ,</l>
       <l n="320">The single sheep , and the one blasted tree ,</l>
       <l n="321">And the bleak music from that old stone wall , 320</l>
       <l n="322">The noise of wood and water , and the mist</l>
       <l n="323">That on the line of each of those two roads</l>
       <l n="324">Advanced in such indisputable shapes ;</l>
       <l n="325">All these were kindred spectacles and sounds</l>
       <l n="326">To which I oft repaired , and thence would drink , 325</l>
       <l n="327">As at a fountain ; and on winter nights ,</l>
       <l n="328">Down to this very time , when storm and rain</l>
       <l n="329">Beat on my roof , or , haply , at noon-day ,</l>
       <l n="330">While in a grove I walk , whose lofty trees ,</l>
       <l n="331">Laden with summer 's thickest foliage , rock 330</l>
       <l n="332">In a strong wind , some working of the spirit ,</l>
       <l n="333">Some inward agitations thence are brought ,</l>
       <l n="334">Whate'er their office , whether to beguile</l>
       <l n="335">Thoughts over busy in the course they took ,</l>
       <l n="336">Or animate an hour of vacant ease . 335</l>

     <p>“ a point , marked on the map as ‘ High Crag ’ between the two roads , and about three-quarters of a mile from their point of divergence , answers the description as well as any other . It may be nearly two miles from Hawkshead , a distance of which an active eager school-boy would think nothing . The ‘ blasted hawthorn ’ and the ‘ naked wall ’ are probably things of the past as much as the ‘ single sheep . ’ ”</p>
     <p>Doubtless this may be the spot ,— a green , rocky knoll with a steep face to the north , where a quarry is wrought , and with a plantation to the east . It commands a view of both roads . The other possible place is a crag , not a quarter of a mile from Outgate , a little to the right of the place where the two roads divide . A low wall runs up across it to the top , dividing a plantation of oak , hazel , and ash , from the firs that crown the summit . These firs , which are larch and spruce , seem all of this century . The top of the crag may have been bare when Wordsworth lived at Hawkshead . But at the foot of the path along the dividing wall there are a few ( probably older ) trees ; and a solitary walk beneath them , at noon or dusk , is almost as suggestive to the imagination , as repose under the yews of Borrowdale , listening to “ the mountain flood ” on Glaramara . There one may still hear the bleak music from the old stone wall , and “ the noise of wood and water , ” while the loud dry wind whistles through the underwood , or moans amid the fir trees of the Crag , on the summit of which there is a “ blasted hawthorn ” tree . It may be difficult now to determine the precise spot to which the boy Wordsworth climbed on that eventful day — afterwards so significant to him , and from the events of which , he says , he drank “ as at a fountain ” — but I think it may have been to one or other of these two crags .

       <l n="9">Mr. William Davies writes :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Is he absolutely right in attributing these powers to the objects of Nature , which are only symbols after all ? Is there not a more penetrative and ethereal perceptive power in the human mind , which is able to transfer itself immediately to the spiritual plane , transcending that of visible Nature ? Plato saw it ; the old Vedantist still more clearly — and what is more — reached it . He arrived at the knowledge and perception of essential Being : though he could neither define nor limit , in a human formula , because it is undefinable and illimitable , but positive and abstract , universally diffused , ‘ smaller than small , greater than great , ’ the internal Light , Monitor , Guide , Rest , waiting to be seen , recognised , and known in every heart ; not depending on the powers of Nature for enlightenment and instruction , but itself enlightening and instructing : not merely a receptive , but the motive power of Nature ; which bestows itself upon Nature , and only receives from it that which it bestows . Is it not , as he says farther on , better ‘ to see great truths , ’ even if not so strictly in line and form , ‘ touch and handle little ones , ’ to take the highest point of view we can reach , not a lower one ? And surely it is a higher thing to rule over and subdue Nature , than to lie ruled and subdued by it ? The highest form of Religion has always done this . ”</p>

<note>Footnote C : For a hint in reference to this road , I am indebted to the late Dr. Henry Dodgson of Cockermouth . Referring to my suggestion that it might be the road from Cockermouth to Bridekirk , he wrote ( July 1878 ) ,</note>     <note xml:id="noteC_17" place="bottom" n="C">For a hint in reference to this road , I am indebted to the late Dr. Henry Dodgson of Cockermouth . Referring to my suggestion that it might be the road from Cockermouth to Bridekirk , he wrote ( July 1878 ) ,</note>
     <p>“ I scarcely think that road answers to the description . The hill over which it goes is not naked but well wooded , and has probably been so for many years . Besides , it is not visible from Wordsworth 's house , nor from the garden behind it . This garden extends from the house to the river Derwent , from which it is separated by a wall , with a raised terraced walk on the inner side , and nearly on a level with the top . I understand that this terrace was in existence in the poet 's time .... Its direction is nearly due east and west ; and looking eastward from it , there is a hill which bounds the view in that direction , and which fully corresponds to the description in ‘ The Prelude ’ . It is from one and a half to two miles distant , of considerable height , is bare and destitute of trees , and has a road going directly over its summit , as seen from the terrace in Wordsworth 's garden . This road is now used only as a footpath ; but , fifty or sixty years ago it was the highroad to Isel , a hamlet on the Derwent , about three and a half miles from Cockermouth , in the direction of Bassenthwaite Lake . The hill is locally called ‘ the Hay , ’ but on the Ordnance map it is marked ‘ Watch Hill . ’ ”</p>
     <p>There can be little doubt as to the accuracy of this suggestion . No other hill-road is visible from the house or garden at Cockermouth . The view from the front of the old mansion is limited by houses , doubtless more so now than in last century ; but there is no hill towards the Lorton Fells on the south or south-east , with a road over it , visible from any part of the town . Besides , as this was a very early experience of Wordsworth 's — it was in “ the morn of childhood ” that the road was “ daily present to his sight ” — it must have been seen , either from the house or from the garden . It is almost certain that he refers to the path over the Hay or Watch Hill , which he and his “ sister Emmeline ” could see daily from the high terrace , at the foot of their garden in Cockermouth , where they used to “ chase the butterfly ” and visit the “ sparrow 's nest ” in the “ impervious shelter ” of privet and roses .</p>
     <p>Dr. Cradock wrote to me ( January 1886 ) ,</p>
     <p>“ an old map of the county round about Keswick , including Cockermouth , dated 1789 , entirely confirms Dr. Dodgson 's statement . The road over ‘ Hay Hill ’ is marked clearly as a carriage road to Isel . The miles are marked on the map . The ‘ summit ’ of the hill is ‘ naked ': for the map marks woods , where they existed , and none are marked on Hay Hill . ” — Ed . ]</p>

       <l n="2">Fade from remembrance ! ) through the Northern tracts</l>
       <l n="3">Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend , [ A ]</l>
       <l n="4">I left Bethgelert 's huts at couching-time ,</l>
       <l n="5">And westward took my way , to see the sun 5</l>
       <l n="6">Rise from the top of Snowdon . To the door</l>
       <l n="7">Of a rude cottage at the mountain 's base</l>
       <l n="8">We came , and roused the shepherd who attends</l>
       <l n="9">The adventurous stranger 's steps , a trusty guide ;</l>
       <l n="10">Then , cheered by short refreshment , sallied forth . 10</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="11">It was a close , warm , breezeless summer night ,</l>
       <l n="12">Wan , dull , and glaring , with a dripping fog</l>
       <l n="13">Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky ;</l>
       <l n="14">But , undiscouraged , we began to climb</l>
       <l n="15">The mountain-side . The mist soon girt us round , 15</l>
       <l n="16">And , after ordinary travellers ’ talk</l>
       <l n="17">With our conductor , pensively we sank</l>
       <l n="18">Each into commerce with his private thoughts :</l>
       <l n="19">Thus did we breast the ascent , and by myself</l>
       <l n="20">Was nothing either seen or heard that checked 20</l>
       <l n="21">Those musings or diverted , save that once</l>
       <l n="22">The shepherd 's lurcher , who , among the crags ,</l>
       <l n="23">Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog , teased</l>
       <l n="24">His coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent .</l>
       <l n="25">This small adventure , for even such it seemed 25</l>
       <l n="26">In that wild place and at the dead of night ,</l>
       <l n="27">Being over and forgotten , on we wound</l>
       <l n="28">In silence as before . With forehead bent</l>
       <l n="29">Earthward , as if in opposition set</l>
       <l n="30">Against an enemy , I panted up 30</l>
       <l n="31">With eager pace , and no less eager thoughts .</l>
       <l n="32">Thus might we wear a midnight hour away ,</l>
       <l n="33">Ascending at loose distance each from each ,</l>
       <l n="34">And I , as chanced , the foremost of the band ;</l>
       <l n="35">When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten , 35</l>
       <l n="36">And with a step or two seemed brighter still ;</l>
       <l n="37">Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause ,</l>
       <l n="38">For instantly a light upon the turf</l>
       <l n="39">Fell like a flash , and lo ! as I looked up ,</l>
       <l n="40">The Moon hung naked in a firmament 40</l>
       <l n="41">Of azure without cloud , and at my feet</l>
       <l n="42">Rested a silent sea of hoary mist .</l>
       <l n="43">A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved</l>
       <l n="44">All over this still ocean ; and beyond ,</l>
       <l n="45">Far , far beyond , the solid vapours stretched , 45</l>
       <l n="46">In headlands , tongues , and promontory shapes ,</l>
       <l n="47">Into the main Atlantic , that appeared</l>
       <l n="48">To dwindle , and give up his majesty ,</l>
       <l n="49">Usurped upon far as the sight could reach .</l>
       <l n="50">Not so the ethereal vault ; encroachment none 50</l>
       <l n="51">Was there , nor loss ; only the inferior stars</l>
       <l n="52">Had disappeared , or shed a fainter light</l>
       <l n="53">In the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon ,</l>
       <l n="54">Who , from her sovereign elevation , gazed</l>
       <l n="55">Upon the billowy ocean , as it lay 55</l>
       <l n="56">All meek and silent , save that through a rift —</l>
       <l n="57">Not distant from the shore whereon we stood ,</l>
       <l n="58">A fixed , abysmal , gloomy , breathing-place —</l>
       <l n="59">Mounted the roar of waters , torrents , streams</l>
       <l n="60">Innumerable , roaring with one voice ! 60</l>
       <l n="61">Heard over earth and sea , and , in that hour ,</l>
       <l n="62">For so it seemed , felt by the starry heavens .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="63">When into air had partially dissolved</l>
       <l n="64">That vision , given to spirits of the night</l>
       <l n="65">And three chance human wanderers , in calm thought 65</l>
       <l n="66">Reflected , it appeared to me the type</l>
       <l n="67">Of a majestic intellect , its acts</l>
       <l n="68">And its possessions , what it has and craves ,</l>
       <l n="69">What in itself it is , and would become .</l>
       <l n="70">There I beheld the emblem of a mind 70</l>

       <l n="72">Over the dark abyss , [ B ] intent to hear</l>
       <l n="73">Its voices issuing forth to silent light</l>
       <l n="74">In one continuous stream ; a mind sustained</l>
       <l n="75">By recognitions of transcendent power , 75</l>
       <l n="76">In sense conducting to ideal form ,</l>
       <l n="77">In soul of more than mortal privilege .</l>
       <l n="78">One function , above all , of such a mind</l>
       <l n="79">Had Nature shadowed there , by putting forth ,</l>
       <l n="80">‘ Mid circumstances awful and sublime , 80</l>
       <l n="81">That mutual domination which she loves</l>
       <l n="82">To exert upon the face of outward things ,</l>
       <l n="83">So moulded , joined , abstracted , so endowed</l>
       <l n="84">With interchangeable supremacy ,</l>
       <l n="85">That men , least sensitive , see , hear , perceive , 85</l>
       <l n="86">And cannot choose but feel . The power , which all</l>
       <l n="87">Acknowledge when thus moved , which Nature thus</l>
       <l n="88">To bodily sense exhibits , is the express</l>
       <l n="89">Resemblance of that glorious faculty</l>
       <l n="90">That higher minds bear with them as their own . 90</l>
       <l n="91">This is the very spirit in which they deal</l>
       <l n="92">With the whole compass of the universe :</l>
       <l n="93">They from their native selves can send abroad</l>
       <l n="94">Kindred mutations ; for themselves create</l>
       <l n="95">A like existence ; and , whene'er it dawns 95</l>
       <l n="96">Created for them , catch it , or are caught</l>
       <l n="97">By its inevitable mastery ,</l>
       <l n="98">Like angels stopped upon the wind by sound</l>
       <l n="99">Of harmony from Heaven 's remotest spheres .</l>
       <l n="100">Them the enduring and the transient both 100</l>
       <l n="101">Serve to exalt ; they build up greatest things</l>
       <l n="102">From least suggestions ; ever on the watch ,</l>
       <l n="103">Willing to work and to be wrought upon ,</l>
       <l n="104">They need not extraordinary calls</l>
       <l n="105">To rouse them ; in a world of life they live , 105</l>
       <l n="106">By sensible impressions not enthralled ,</l>
       <l n="107">But by their quickening impulse made more prompt</l>
       <l n="108">To hold fit converse with the spiritual world ,</l>
       <l n="109">And with the generations of mankind</l>
       <l n="110">Spread over time , past , present , and to come , 110</l>
       <l n="111">Age after age , till Time shall be no more .</l>
       <l n="112">Such minds are truly from the Deity ,</l>
       <l n="113">For they are Powers ; and hence the highest bliss</l>
       <l n="114">That flesh can know is theirs — the consciousness</l>
       <l n="115">Of Whom they are , habitually infused 115</l>
       <l n="116">Through every image and through every thought ,</l>
       <l n="117">And all affections by communion raised</l>
       <l n="118">From earth to heaven , from human to divine ;</l>

       <l n="120">Whether discursive or intuitive ; [ C ] 120</l>

      <head>FROM THE ITALIAN OF MICHAEL ANGELO</head>
       <l n="1">Translated 1805 ?— Published 1807</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Translations from Michael Angelo , done at the request of Mr. Duppa , whose acquaintance I made through Mr. Southey . Mr. Duppa was engaged in writing the life of Michael Angelo , and applied to Mr. Southey and myself to furnish some specimens of his poetic genius .— I . F .</note>
     <p>Compare the two sonnets entitled ‘ At Florence — from Michael Angelo ’ , in the “ Memorials of a Tour in Italy ” in 1837 .</p>
     <p>The following extract from a letter of Wordsworth 's to Sir George Beaumont , dated October 17 , 1805 , will cast light on the next three sonnets .</p>
     <p>“ I mentioned Michael Angelo 's poetry some time ago ; it is the most difficult to construe I ever met with , but just what you would expect from such a man , shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things . There is a mistake in the world concerning the Italian language ; the poetry of Dante and Michael Angelo proves , that if there be little majesty and strength in Italian verse , the fault is in the authors , and not in the tongue . I can translate , and have translated two books of Ariosto , at the rate , nearly , of one hundred lines a day ; but so much meaning has been put by Michael Angelo into so little room , and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself , that I found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable . I attempted , at least , fifteen of the sonnets , but could not anywhere succeed . I have sent you the only one I was able to finish ; it is far from being the best , or most characteristic , but the others were too much for me . ”</p>
     <p>The last of the three sonnets probably belongs to the year 1804 , as it is quoted in a letter to Sir George Beaumont , dated Grasmere , August 6 . The year is not given , but I think it must have been 1804 , as he says that “ within the last month , ” he had written , “ 700 additional lines ” of ‘ The Prelude ’ ; and that poem was finished in May 1805 .</p>
     <p>The titles given to them make it necessary to place these Sonnets in the order which follows .</p>

     <p>The sonnet from which the above is translated , is not wholly by Michael Angelo , the sculptor and painter , but is taken from patched-up versions of his poem by his nephew of the same name . Michael Angelo only wrote the first eight lines , and these have been garbled in his nephew 's edition . The original lines are thus given by Guasti in his edition of Michael Angelo 's Poems ( 1863 ) restored to their true reading , from the autograph MSS . in Rome and Florence .</p>

    <p n="9">NOTE II .— THE HAWKSHEAD BECK</p>
    <p n="10">( See pp . 188-89 , ‘ The Prelude ’ , book iv . )</p>
    <p n="11">Mr. Rawnsley , formerly of Wray Vicarage — now Canon Rawnsley of Crosthwaite Vicarage , Keswick — sent me the following letter in reference to :</p>
    <p n="12">... that unruly child of mountain birth , The famous brook , who , soon as he was boxed Within our garden , found himself at once , As if by trick insidious and unkind , Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down ... I looked at him and smiled , and smiled again , ... ‘ Ha , ’ quoth I , ‘ pretty prisoner , are you there ! ’</p>
    <p n="13">“ I was not quite content with Dr. Cradock 's identification of this brook , or of the garden ; partly because , beyond the present garden square I found , on going up the brook , other garden squares , which were much more likely to have been the garden belonging to Anne Tyson 's cottage , and because in these garden plots the stream was not ‘ stripped of his voice , ’ by the covering of Coniston flags , as is the case lower down towards the market place ; and partly because — as you notice — you can both hear and see the stream through the interstices of the flags , and that it can hardly be described ( by one who will listen ) as stripped of its voice .</p>
    <p n="14">At the same time I was bound to admit that in comparing the voice of the stream here in the ‘ channel paved by man 's officious care ’ with the sound of it up in the fields beyond the vicarage , nearer its birth-place , it certainly might be said to be softer voiced ; and as the poet speaks of it as ‘ that unruly child of mountain birth , ’ it looks as if he too had realised the difference .</p>
    <p n="15">But whilst I thought that the identification of Dr. Cradock and yourself was very happy ( in absence of other possibilities ) , I had not thought that Wordsworth would describe the stream as ‘ dimpling down , ’ or address it as a ‘ pretty prisoner . ’ A smaller stream seemed necessary .</p>
    <p n="16">It was , therefore , not a little curious that , in poking about among the garden plots on the west bank of the stream , fronting ( as nearly as I could judge ) Anne Tyson 's cottage , to seek for remains of the ash tree , in which so often the poet — as he lay awake on summer nights — had watched ‘ the moon in splendour couched among the leaves , ’ rocking ‘ with every impulse of the breeze , ’ I not only stumbled upon the remains of an ash tree — now a ‘ pollard ’ — which is evidently sprung from a larger tree since decayed ( and which for all I know may be one of the actual parts of the ancient tree itself ) ; but also had the good luck to fall into conversation with a certain Isaac Hodgson , who volunteered the following information .</p>
    <p n="17">First , that Wordsworth , it was commonly said , had lodged part of his time with one Betty Braithwaite , in the very house called Church Hill House .</p>
    <p n="18">She was a widow , and kept a confectionery shop , and ‘ did a deal of baking , ’ he believed .</p>
    <p n="19">Secondly , that there was a little patch of garden at the back of the house , with a famous spring well — still called Old Betty 's Well — in it , and that only a few paces from where I was then standing by the pollard ash .</p>
    <p n="20">On jumping over the fence I found myself on the western side of the quaint old Church Hill House , with magnificent views of the whole of the western side of Hawkshead Vale ; grassy swell and wooded rises taking the eye up to the moorland ridge between us and Coniston .</p>
    <p n="21">‘ But , ’ said I , ‘ what about Betty 's Well . ’ ‘ Oh , ’ said my friend , ‘ that 's a noted spring , that never freezes , and always runs ; we all drink of it , and neighbours send to it . Here it is , ’ he continued ; and , gazing down , I saw a little dripping well of water , lustrous , clear , coming evidently in continuous force from the springs or secret channels up hill , pausing for a moment at the trough , thence falling into a box or ‘ channel paved by man 's officious care , ’ and in a moment out of sight and soundless , to pursue its way , ‘ stripped of its voice , ’ towards the main Town beck , that ran at the north-east border of the garden plot . ‘ Ha , pretty prisoner , ’ and the words ‘ dimple down ’ came to my mind at once as appropriate . ‘ Old Betty 's Well gave the key-note of the ‘ famous brook ’ ; and ‘ boxed within our garden ’ seemed an appropriate and exact description .</p>
    <p n="22">Trace of ‘ the sunny seat Round the stone table under the dark pine , ’</p>
    <p n="23">was there none . Not so , however , the Ash tree , the remains of which I have spoken of . From the bedroom of Betty Braithwaite 's house the boy could have watched the moon ,</p>
    <p n="24">‘ while to and fro In the dark summit of the waving tree She rocked with every impulse of the breeze . ’</p>
    <p n="25">‘ In old times , ’ said my friend , ‘ the wall fence ran across the garden , just beyond this spring well , so you see it was but a small spot , was this garden close . ’ Yes ; but the</p>
    <p n="26">‘ crowd of things About its narrow precincts all beloved , ’</p>
    <p n="27">were known the better , and loved the more on that account . Certainly , thought I to myself , here is the famous spring ; a brook that Wordsworth must have known , and that may have been the centre of memory to him in his description of those early Hawkshead days , with its metaphor of fountain life .</p>
    <p n="28">May we not , as we gaze on this little fountain well , in a garden plot at the back of one of the grey huts of this ‘ one dear vale , ’ point as with a wand , and say ,</p>
    <p n="29">‘ This portion of the river of his mind Came from yon fountain . ’</p>
    <p n="30">Is it not possible that the old dame whose</p>
    <p n="31">‘ Clear though shallow stream of piety , Ran on the Sabbath days a fresher course , ’</p>
    <p n="32">was Betty Braithwaite , the aged dame who owned the cottage hard by ? ”</p>
    <p n="33">The following additional extract from a letter of Mr. Rawnsley 's ( Christmas , 1882 ) casts light , both on the Hawkshead beck and fountain , and on the stone seat in the market square , referred to in the fourth book of ‘ The Prelude ’ .</p>
    <p n="34">“ Postlethwaite of the Sun Inn at Hawkshead , has a father aged 82 , who can remember that there was a stone bench , not called old Betty 's , but Old Jane 's Stone , on which she used to spread nuts and cakes for the scholars of the Grammar School , but that it did not stand where the Market Hall now is , and no one ever remembers a stone or stone-bench standing there . This stone or stone-bench stood about opposite the Red Lion inn , in front of the little row of houses that run east and west , just as you pass out of the village in a northerly direction by the Red Lion . This stone or stone-bench is not associated with dark pine trees , but they may have passed away root and branch in an earlier generation .</p>
    <p n="35">Next and most interesting , I think , as showing that I was right in the matter of the famous fountain , or spring in the garden , behind Betty Braithwaite 's house . There exists in Hawkshead near this house a covered-in place or shed , to which all the village repair for their drinking-water , and always have done so . It is known by the name of the Spout House , and the water — which flows all the year from a longish spout , with an overflow one by its side — comes direct from the little drop well in Betty B . ' s garden , after having its voice stripped and boxed therein ; and , falling out of the spout into a deep stone basin and culvert , runs through the town to join the Town Beck .</p>
    <p n="36">So wedded are the Hawkshead folk to this , their familiar fountainhead , that though water is supplied in stand-pipes now from a Reservoir , the folks wo n't have it , and come here to this spout-house , bucket and jug in hand , morn , noon and night . I have never seen anything so like a continental scene at the gathering at Hawkshead spout-house .</p>
    <p n="37">Lastly , there is a very aged thorn-tree in the churchyard — blown over but propped up — in which the forefathers of the hamlet used to sit as boys ( in the thorn , that is , not the churchyard ) , and which has been worn smooth by many Hawkshead generations . The tradition is , that Wordsworth used to sit a deal in it when at school . ”</p>

    <p n="39">NOTE III .— THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK : SUMMER VACATION</p>
    <p n="40">( See p. 197 , ‘ The Prelude ’ , book iv . ll . 323-38 )</p>
    <p n="41">If the farm-house where Wordsworth spent the evening before this memorable morning walk was either at Elterwater or High Arnside , and the homeward pathway led across the ridge of Ironkeld , either by the old mountain road ( now almost disused ) , or over the pathless fells , there are two points from either of which the sea might be seen in the distance . The one is from the heights looking down to the Duddon estuary , across the Coniston valley ; the other is from a spot nearer Hawkshead , where Morecambe Bay is visible . In the former case “ the meadows and the lower grounds ” would be those in Yewdale ; in the latter case , they would be those between Latterbarrow and Hawkshead ; and , on either alternative , the “ solid mountains ” would be those of the Coniston group — the Old Man and Wetherlam . It is also possible that the course of the walk was over the Latterbarrow fells , or heights of Colthouse ; but , from the reference to the sunrise “ not unseen ” from the copse and field , through which the “ homeward pathway wound , ” it may be supposed that the course was south-east , and therefore not over these fells , when his back would have been to the sun . Dr. Cradock 's note [ Footnote T to book iv ] to the text ( p. 197 ) sums up all that can “ be safely said ” ; but Mr. Rawnsley has supplied me with the following interesting remarks :</p>
    <p n="42">“ After a careful reading of the passage describing the poet 's return from a festal night , spent in some farm-house beyond the hills , I am quite unable to say that the path from High Arnside over the Ironkeld range entirely suits the description . Is it not possible that the lad had school-fellows whose parents lived in Yewdale ? If he had , and was returning from the party in one of the Yewdale farms , he would , as he ascended towards Tarn Howes , and faced about south , to gain the main Coniston road , by traversing the meadows between Berwick ground and the top of the Hawkshead and Coniston Hill , command a view of the sea that ‘ lay laughing at a distance ’ ; and ‘ near , the solid mountains ’ — Wetherlam and Coniston Old Man — would shine ‘ bright as the clouds . ’ I think this is likely to have been the poet 's track , because he speaks of labourers going forth to till the fields ; and the Yewdale valley is one that is ( at its head ) chiefly arable , so that he would be likelier to have gazed on them there than in the vale of Hawkshead itself . One is here , however — as in a former passage , when we fixed on Yewdale as the one described as being a ‘ cultured vale ’ — obliged to remember that in Wordsworth 's boyhood wheat was grown more extensively than is now the case in these parts . Of course , the Furness Fell , above Colthouse , might have been the scene . It is eminently suited to the description . ”</p>

    <p n="44">NOTE IV .— DOROTHY WORDSWORTH AT CAMBRIDGE IN 1808 . THE ASH TREE AT ST. JOHN 'S COLLEGE</p>
    <p n="45">( See p. 224 , ‘ The Prelude ’ , book vi . ll . 76-94 )</p>
    <p n="46">The following is an extract from a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth 's to Lady Beaumont at Coleorton , dated “ 14th August , ” probably in 1808 :</p>
    <p n="47">“ We reached Cambridge at half-past nine . In our way to the Inn we stopped at the gate of St. John 's College to set down one of our passengers . The stopping of the carriage roused me from a sleepy musing , and I was awe-stricken with the solemnity of the old gateway , and the light from a great distance within streaming along the pavement . When they told me it was the entrance to ‘ St. John 's ’ College , I was still more affected by the gloomy yet beautiful sight before me , for I thought of my dearest brother in his youthful days passing through that gateway to his home , and I could have believed that I saw him there even then , as I had seen him in the first year of his residence . I met with Mr. Clarkson at the Inn , and was , you may believe , rejoiced to hear his voice at the coach door . We supped together , and immediately after supper I went to bed , and slept well , and at 8 o'clock next morning went to Trinity Chapel . There I stood for many minutes in silence before the statue of Newton , while the organ sounded . I never saw a statue that gave me one hundredth part so much pleasure — but pleasure , that is not the word , it is a sublime sensation — in harmony with sentiments of devotion to the Divine Being , and reverence for the holy places where He is worshipped . We walked in the groves all the morning and visited the Colleges . I sought out a favourite ash tree which my brother speaks of in his poem on his own life — a tree covered with ivy . We dined with a fellow of Peter-House in his rooms , and after dinner I went to King 's College Chapel . There , and everywhere else at Cambridge , I was even much more impressed with the effect of the buildings than I had been formerly , and I do believe that this power of receiving an enlarged enjoyment from the sight of buildings is one of the privileges of our later years . I have this moment received a letter from William .... ”</p>

    <p n="49">NOTE V .— “ THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS ”</p>
    <p n="50">( See p. 353 , ‘ The Prelude ’ , book xii . l. 293 )</p>
    <p n="51">The following extract from a letter of Mr. Rawnsley 's casts important light on a difficult question of localization . Dr. Cradock is inclined now to select the Outgate Crag , the second of the four places referred to by Mr. Rawnsley . But the first may have been the place , and the extract which follows will show how much is yet to be done in this matter of localizing poetical allusions .</p>
    <p n="52">“ As to</p>
    <p n="53">‘ the crag , That , from the meeting-point of two highways Ascending , overlooked them both , far stretched , ’</p>
    <p n="54">there seems to be no doubt but that we have four competitors for the honour of being the place to which the poet :</p>
    <p n="55">‘ impatient for the sight Of those led palfreys that should bear them home ’</p>
    <p n="56">repaired with his brothers</p>
    <p n="57">‘ one Christmas-time , On the glad eve of its dear holidays . ’</p>
    <p n="58">And unless , as it seems is quite possible , from what one sees in other of Wordsworth 's poems , he really stood on one of the crags , and then in his description drew the picture of the landscape at his feet from his memory of what it was as seen from another of the vantage places , we need a high crag , rising gradually or abruptly from the actual meeting-place of two highways , with , if possible at this distance of time , a wall — or traces of it — quite at its summit . ( I may mention that the wallers in this country still give two hundred years as the length of time that a dry wall will stand . ) We need also traces of an old thorn tree close by . The wall , too , must be so placed on the summit of the crag that , as it faces the direction in which the lad is looking for his palfrey , it shall afford shelter to him against</p>
    <p n="59">‘ the sleety rain , And all the business of the elements . ’</p>
    <p n="60">It is evident that the lad would be looking out in a north-easterly direction , i. e. towards the head of Windermere and Ambleside . So that</p>
    <p n="61">‘ the mist , That on the line of each of those two roads Advanced in such indisputable shapes , ’</p>
    <p n="62">was urged by a wind that found the poet at his look-out station , glad to have the wall between him and it . Further , there must be in close proximity wood and the sound of rushing water , or the lapping of a lake wind-driven against the marge , for the boy remembers that ‘ the bleak music from that old stone wall ’ was mingled with ‘ the noise of wood and water . ’ The roads spoken of must be two highways , and must be capable of being seen for some distance ; unless , as it is just possible , the epithet ‘ far-stretched ’ may be taken as applying not so much to the roads , as to the gradual ascent of the crag from the meeting-place of the two highways .</p>
    <p n="63">The scene from the crag must be extended , and half plain half wood-land ; at least one gathers as much from the lines :</p>
    <p n="64">‘ as the mist Gave intermitting prospect of the copse And plain beneath . ’</p>
    <p n="65">Lastly , it was a day of driving sleet and mist , and this of itself would necessitate that the poet and his brothers should only go to the place close to which the ponies must pass , or from which most plainly the roads were visible .</p>
    <p n="66">The boys too were</p>
    <p n="67">‘ feverish , and tired , and restless , ’</p>
    <p n="68">and a schoolboy , to gain his point on such a day and on such an errand , does not take much account of a mile of country to be travelled over .</p>
    <p n="69">So that it is immaterial , I think , to make the distance from Hawkshead of either of the four crags or vantage grounds a factor in decision .</p>
    <p n="70">The farther the lads were from home when they met their ponies , the longer ride back they would have , and this to schoolboys is matter of consideration at such times .</p>
    <p n="71">Taking then a survey of the ground of choice , we have to decide whether the crag in question is situated at the first division or main split of the road from Ambleside furthest from Hawkshead , or whether at the place where the two roads converge again into one nearer Hawkshead .</p>
    <p n="72">Whether , that is , the crag above the Pullwyke quarry , at the junction of the road to Water Barngates and the road to Wray and Outgate is to be selected , about two miles from Hawkshead ; or whether we are to fix on the spot you have chosen , at the point about a mile north-east of Hawkshead , ‘ called in the ordnance map Outgate . ’</p>
    <p n="73">Of the two I incline to the former , for these reasons . The boys could not be so certain of ‘ not missing the ponies ’ , at any other place than here at Pullwyke .</p>
    <p n="74">The crag exactly answers the poet 's description , a rising ground , the meeting-place of two highways . For in the poet 's time the old Hawkshead and Outgate road at the Pullwyke corner ran at the very foot of the rising ground ( roughly speaking ) parallel to and some 60 to 100 yards west of the present road from the Pull to Wray .</p>
    <p n="75">It is true that no trace of wall is visible at its summit , but the summit has been planted since with trees , and walls are often removed at time of planting .</p>
    <p n="76">The poet would have a full view of the main road , down to , and round , the Pullwyke Bay ; he would see the branch road from the fork , as it mounted the Water Barngates Hill , to the west , and would see the other road of the fork far-stretched and going south .</p>
    <p n="77">He would also have an extended view of copse and meadow land . He might , if the wind were south-easterly , hear the noise of Windermere , sobbing in the Pullwyke Bay , and would without doubt hear also the roar of the Pull Beck water , as it passed down from the Ironkeld slopes on his left towards the lake .</p>
    <p n="78">It might be objected that the poem gives us the idea of a crag which , from the Hawkshead side at any rate , would require to be of more difficult ascent than this is , to justify the idea of difficulty as suggested in the lines :</p>
    <p n="79">‘ thither I repaired , Scout-like , and gained the summit ; ’</p>
    <p n="80">but I do not think we need read more into the lines than that the boy felt — as he scanned the country with his eyes , on the ‘ qui vive ’ at every rise in the ground — the feelings of a scout , who questions constantly the distant prospect .</p>
    <p n="81">And certainly the Pullwyke quarry crag rises most steeply from the meeting-point of the two highways .</p>
    <p n="82">Next as to the Outgate crag , which you have chosen . I am out of love with it . First , if the lads wanted to make sure of the ponies , they would not have ascended it , but would have stayed just at the Hawkshead side of Outgate , or at the village itself , at the point of convergence of the ways .</p>
    <p n="83">Secondly , the crag can hardly be described as rising from the meeting-point of two highways ; only one highway passes near it .</p>
    <p n="84">The crag is of so curious a formation geologically , that I can n't fancy the poet describing his memory of it , without calling it a terraced hill , or an ascent by natural terraces .</p>
    <p n="85">Then , again , the prospect is not sufficiently extended from it . The stream not near enough , or rather not of size enough , to be heard . Blelham Tarn is not too far to have added to the watery sound , it is true , but the wind we suppose to have been north-east , and the sound of the Blelham Tarn would be much carried away from him .</p>
    <p n="86">The present stone wall is not near the summit , and is of comparatively recent date . It is difficult to believe from the slope of the outcrop of rock that a wall could ever have been at the summit .</p>
    <p n="87">But there are two other vantage grounds intermediate between those extremes , both of which were probably in the mind and memory of the poet as he described the scene , and</p>
    <p n="88">‘ The intermitting prospect of the copse . And plain beneath , ’</p>
    <p n="89">allowed him by the mist . One of these is the High Crag , about three-quarters of a mile from the divergence or convergence of the two highways , which Dr. Cradock has selected .</p>
    <p n="90">There can be no doubt that this is the crag ‘ par excellence ’ for a wide and extended look-out over all the country between Outgate and Ambleside . Close at its summit there remain aged thorn trees , but no trace of a wall .</p>
    <p n="91">But High Crag can hardly be said to have risen at ‘ the meeting-point of two highways , ’ unless we are to understand the epithet ‘ far-stretched ’ as applying to the south-western slopes or skirts of the hill ; and the two highways , the roads between Water Barngates on the west , and the bridle road between Pullwyke and Outgate at their Outgate junction , and this is rather too far a stretch .</p>
    <p n="92">It is quite true that if bridle paths can be described as highways , there may be said to be a meeting-point of these close at the north-eastern side of the crag .</p>
    <p n="93">But , remembering that the ponies came from Penrith , the driver was not likely to have had any intimate knowledge of these bridle paths ; while , at the same time , on that misty day , I much question whether the boys on the look-out at High Crag could have seen ponies creeping along between walled roads at so great a distance as half a mile or more .</p>
    <p n="94">And this would seem to have been the problem for them on that day .</p>
    <p n="95">I ought in fairness to say that it is not likely that the roads were then ( as to-day ) walled up high on either side . To-day , even from the summit of High Crag , only the head and ears of a pony could be seen as it passed up the Water Barngates Road ; but at the end of last century many of the roads were only partially walled off from the moorlands they passed over in the Lake Country .</p>
    <p n="96">Still , as I said , High Crag was a point of vantage that the poet , as a lad , must have often climbed , in this part of the country , if he wanted to indulge in the delights of panoramic scene .</p>
    <p n="97">There is a wall some hundred yards from the summit , on the south-westerly flank of High Crag ; near this — at a point close by , two large holly trees — the boy might have sheltered himself against the north-eastern wind , and have got a closer and better view of the road between Barngates and Outgate , and Randy Pike and Outgate .</p>
    <p n="98">Here , too , he could possibly hear the sound of the stream in the dingle or woody hollow immediately at his feet ; but I am far from content with this as being the spot the poet watched from .</p>
    <p n="99">There is again a fourth possible look-out place , to which you will remember I directed your attention , nearer Randy Pike . The slope , covered with larches , rises up from the Randy Pike Road to a precipitous crag which faces north and east .</p>
    <p n="100">From this , a grand view of the country between Randy Pike and Pullwyke is obtained , and if the bridle paths might — as is possible , but unlikely — be called two highways , then this crag could be spoken of as rising from the meeting place of the two highways . For the old Hawkshead Road passed along to the east , within calling distance ( say ninety yards ) , and a bridle road from Pullwyke , now used chiefly by the quarrymen , passed within eighty yards to the west ; while it is certain that the brook below , when swollen by winter rains , might be loud enough to be heard from the copse . This crag is known as Coldwell or Caudwell Crag , and is situated about half a mile east-south-east of the High Crag .</p>
    <p n="101">It has this much in its favour , that a wall of considerable age crests its summit , and one can whilst sitting down on a rock close behind it be sheltered from the north and east , and yet obtain an extensive view of the subadjacent country . IF it were certain that the ponies when they got to Pullwyke did not go up towards Water Barngates , and so to Hawkshead , then there is no crag in the district which would so thoroughly answer to all the needs of the boys , and to all the points of description the poet has placed on record .</p>
    <p n="102">But it is just this IF that makes me decide on the Pullwyke Crag — the one first described — as being the actual spot to which , scout-like , the schoolboys clomb , on that eventful ‘ eve of their dear holidays ; ’ while , at the same time , it is my firm conviction that Wordsworth — as he painted the memories of that event — had also before his mind 's eye the scene as viewed from Coldwell and High Crag . ”</p>

    <p n="104">NOTE VI .— COLERIDGE 'S LINES TO WORDSWORTH , ON HEARING ‘ THE PRELUDE ’ RECITED BY HIM AT COLEORTON , IN 1806</p>
    <p n="105">The following is a copy of a version of these ‘ Lines ’ , sent by Coleridge to Sir George Beaumont , at Dunmow , Essex , in January , 1807 . The variations , both in the title and in the text , from that which Coleridge finally adopted ( see p. 129 ) , are interesting in many ways :</p>
    <p n="106">LINES</p>
    <p n="107">To William Wordsworth : Composed for the greater part on the same night after the finishing of his recitation of the Poem , in Thirteen Books , on the growth of his own mind .</p>
    <p n="108">O Friend ! O Teacher ! God 's great Gift to me ! Into my Heart have I received that Lay More than historic , that prophetic Lay Wherein ( high theme by thee first sung aright ) Of the foundations and the building up 5 Of thine own spirit thou hast loved to tell What may be told , by words revealable : With heavenly breathings , like the secret soul Of vernal growth , oft quickening in the heart Thoughts , that obey no mastery of words , 10 Pure Self-beholdings ! Theme as hard as high , Of Smiles spontaneous and mysterious Fear ! The first born they of Reason and twin birth ! Of tides obedient to external force , And currents self-determin 'd , as might seem , 15 Or by some inner power ! Of moments awful , Now in thy hidden life , and now abroad , When power stream 'd from thee , and thy soul receiv 'd The light reflected , as a light bestow 'd ! Of fancies fair , and milder hours of youth , 20 Hybloean murmurs of poetic thought Industrious in its joy , in vales and glens Native or outland , Lakes and famous Hills ; Or on the lonely high-road , when the stars Were rising ; or by secret mountain streams , 25 The guides and the companions of thy way ! Of more than Fancy — of the SOCIAL SENSE Distending , and of Man belov 'd as Man , Where France in all her Towns lay vibrating , Even as a Bark becalm 'd on sultry seas 30 Quivers beneath the voice from Heaven , the burst Of Heaven 's immediate thunder , when no cloud Is visible , or shadow on the main ! For thou wert there , thy own brows garlanded , Amid the tremor of a Realm aglow ! 35 Amid a mighty nation jubilant ! When from the general Heart of Human Kind Hope sprang forth , like an armed Deity ! Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down , So summon 'd homeward ; thenceforth calm and sure , 40 As from the Watch-tower of Man 's absolute Self , With light unwaning on her eyes , to look Far on — herself a Glory to behold , The Angel of the Vision ! Then ( last strain ) Of Duty , chosen Laws controlling choice , 45 Action and Joy !— an Orphic Tale indeed , A Tale divine of high and passionate Thoughts , To their own Music chaunted !—</p>
    <p n="109">A great Bard ! Ere yet the last strain dying awed the air , With steadfast eyes I saw thee in the choir 50 Of ever-enduring men . The truly Great Have all one age , and from one visible space Shed influence : for they , both power and act , Are permanent , and Time is not with them , Save as it worketh for them , they in it . 55 Nor less a sacred Roll , than those of old , And to be plac 'd , as they , with gradual fame Among the Archives of Mankind , thy Work Makes audible a linked Song of Truth , Of Truth profound a sweet continuous Song 60 Not learnt , but native , her own natural notes ! Dear shall it be to every human heart , To me how more than dearest ! Me , on whom Comfort from thee , and utterance of thy Love , Come with such Heights and Depths of Harmony 65 Such sense of Wings uplifting , that its might Scatter 'd and quell 'd me , till my Thoughts became A bodily Tumult ; and thy faithful Hopes , Thy Hopes of me , dear Friend ! by me unfelt ! Were troublous to me , almost as a Voice 70 Familiar once and more than musical ; As a dear Woman 's Voice to one cast forth , [ A ] A Wanderer with a worn-out heart forlorn , Mid Strangers pining with untended wounds .</p>
    <p n="110">O Friend ! too well thou know'st , of what sad years 75 The long suppression had benumbed my soul , That , even as Life returns upon the Drown 'd , The unusual Joy awoke a throng of Pains — Keen Pangs of LOVE , awakening , as a Babe , Turbulent , with an outcry in the Heart ! 80 And Fears self-will 'd , that shunn 'd the eye of Hope , And Hope , that scarce would know itself from Fear ; Sense of past youth , and manhood come in vain , And Genius given and Knowledge won in vain ; And all , which I had cull 'd in wood-walks wild , 85 And all , which patient Toil had rear 'd , and all , Commune with THEE had open 'd out — but Flowers Strew 'd on my Corse , and borne upon my Bier , In the same Coffin , for the self-same Grave !</p>
    <p n="111">That way no more ! and ill beseems it me , 90 Who came a Welcomer , in Herald 's Guise , Singing of Glory and Futurity , To wander back on such unhealthful road Plucking the Poisons of Self-harm ! And ill Such intertwine beseems triumphal wreaths 95 Strew 'd before thy advancing ! Thou too , Friend ! Impair thou not the memory of that hour Of thy Communion with my nobler mind By pity or grief , already felt too long ! Nor let my words import more blame than needs . 100 The tumult rose and ceas 'd : for Peace is nigh Where Wisdom 's voice has found a list'ning Heart . Amid the howl of more than wintry storms The Halcyon hears the Voice of vernal Hours , Already on the wing !</p>
    <p n="112">Eve following Eve 105 Dear tranquil Time , when the sweet sense of Home Is sweetest ! Moments , for their own sake hail 'd , And more desired , more precious for thy Song ! In silence listening , like a devout child , My soul lay passive , by the various strain 110 Driven as in surges now , beneath the stars With momentary [ B ] stars of her [ C ] own birth , Fair constellated Foam , still darting off Into the Darkness ; now a tranquil Sea , Outspread and bright , yet swelling to the Moon . 115</p>
    <p n="113">And when — O Friend ! my Comforter ! my [ D ] Guide ! Strong in thyself and powerful to give strength !— Thy long sustained Song finally clos 'd , And thy deep voice had ceas 'd — yet thou thyself Wert still before mine eyes , and round us both 120 That happy Vision of beloved Faces — ( All whom , I deepliest love — in one room all ! ) Scarce conscious and yet conscious of its close I sate , my Being blended in one Thought , ( Thought was it ? or aspiration ? or resolve ? ) 125 Absorb 'd ; yet hanging still upon the Sound — And when I rose , I found myself in Prayer .</p>

    <p n="131">NOTE VII .— GENERAL BEAUPUY</p>
    <p n="132">( See pp . 297 and 302 , ‘ The Prelude ’ , book ix . )</p>
    <p n="133">Professor Emile Legouis of Lyons — a thorough student , and a very competent expounder , of our modern English Literature — supplied me , some years ago , with numerous facts in reference to Wordsworth 's friend General Beaupuy , and his family , from which I extract the following :</p>
    <p n="134">‘ The Prelude ’ gives us very little precise information about the republican officer with whom Wordsworth became acquainted in France , and on whom he bestowed more praise than on almost any other of his contemporaries . We only gather the following facts :— That his name was ‘ Beaupuy ’ , that he was quartered at Orleans , with royalist officers , sometime between November 1791 and the spring of 1792 , and that</p>
    <p n="135">‘ He perished fighting , in supreme command , Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire , For liberty , against deluded men , His fellow-countrymen .... ’</p>
    <p n="136">Though it seems very easy to identify a general even with such scanty data , the task is rendered more difficult by two inaccuracies in Wordsworth 's statement , which , however , can be explained and redressed without much difficulty .</p>
    <p n="137">The first inaccuracy is in the spelling of the name , which is ‘ Beaupuy ’ and not ‘ Beaupuis ’ — a slight mistake considering that Wordsworth was a foreigner , and , besides , wrote down his friend 's name ten years and perhaps more after losing sight of him . Moreover , the name of the general who , I think , was meant by Wordsworth , I have found spelt ‘ Beaupuy ’ in one instance , viz . the signature of a letter of his , as printed in ‘ Vie et Correspondance de Merlin de Thionville ’ , publiée par Jean Reynaud , Paris , 1860 ( 2'e partie p. 241 ) .</p>
    <p n="138">The spelling of proper names was not so fixed then as it is nowadays , and this irregularity is not to be wondered at .</p>
    <p n="139">The second inaccuracy consists in stating that General Beaupuy died on the banks of the Loire during the Vendean war . Indeed , he was grievously wounded at the Battle of Château-Gonthier , on the 26th of October 1793 , and reported as dead . His soldiers thought he had been killed , and the rumour must have spread abroad , as it was recorded by A. Thiers himself in his ‘ Histoire de la Révolution ’ , and by A. Challemel in his ‘ Histoire Musée de la République Française ’ .</p>
    <p n="140">It is no wonder that Wordsworth , who was then in England , and could only read imperfect accounts of what took place in France , should have been mistaken too .</p>
    <p n="141">No other General Beaupuy is recorded in the history of the Revolution , so far as I have been able to ascertain . The moral character of the officer , whose life I shall relate , answers to Wordsworth 's description , and is worthy of his high estimate .</p>
    <p n="142">Armand Michel de Bachelier , Chevalier de Beaupuy , was born at Mussidan , in Perigord , on the 15th of July 1757 . He belonged to a noble family , less proud of its antiquity than of the blood it had shed for France on many battlefields . On his mother 's side ( Mlle . de Villars ) , he reckoned Montaigne , the celebrated essayist , among his ancestors . His parents having imbibed the philanthropic ideas of the time , educated him according to their principles .</p>
    <p n="143">He had four brothers , who were all destined to turn republicans and do good service to the new cause , though their interest certainly lay in the opposite direction .</p>
    <p n="144">...</p>
    <p n="145">He was made sub-lieutenant in the regiment of Bassigny ( 33rd division of foot ) on the 2nd of March 1773 , and lieutenant of grenadiers on the 1st of October of the same year .</p>
    <p n="146">In 1791 he was first lieutenant in the same regiment . Having sided with the Revolution , he was appointed commander of a battalion of national volunteers in the department of Dordogne . I have not found the exact date of this appointment , but it must have taken place immediately after his stay at Orléans with Wordsworth .</p>
    <p n="147">I have found no further mention of his name till September 1792 , when he is known to have served in the “ Armée du Rhin , ” under General Custine , and contributed to the taking of Spire .</p>
    <p n="148">He took an important part in the taking of Worms , 4th October ; of Mayence ( Maenz ) 21st October . He was among the garrison of Mayence when this place was besieged by the Prussians , and obliged to capitulate after a long and famous siege ( from 6th April 1793 to 22nd July 1793 ) . [ A ]</p>
    <p n="149">During the siege he wrote a journal of all the operations . Unfortunately , this journal is very short , and purely military . It has been handed down to us , and is found in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris in the ‘ Papiers de Merlin de Thionville ’ , n. acq . fr . Nos . 244-252 , 8 vol . in-8 °. Beaupuy 's journal is in the 3rd volume , fol . 213-228 .</p>
    <p n="150">...</p>
    <p n="151">In the Vendean war , the “ Mayençais , ” or soldiers returned from Mayence , made themselves conspicuous , and bore almost all the brunt of the campaign . But none of them distinguished himself more than Beaupuy , then a General of Brigade .</p>
    <p n="152">The Mayençais arrived in Vendée at the end of August or beginning of September 1793 . To Beaupuy 's skill the victory of Chollet ( Oct. 17 , 1793 ) is attributed by Jomini . In this battle he fought hand to hand with and overcame a Vendean cavalier . He himself had three horses killed , and had a very narrow escape . On the battlefield he was made ‘ general of division ’ by the “ Represéntants du peuple . ” It was after Chollet that the Vendeans made the memorable crossing of the Loire at St. Florent .</p>
    <p n="153">At Laval and Château-Gonthier ( Oct. 26 ) a terrible defeat was inflicted on the Republicans , owing to the incapacity of their commander-in-chief , Léchelle . The whole corps commanded by General Beaupuy was crushed by a terrible fire , He himself , after withstanding for two or three hours with 2000 or 3000 men all the attacks of the royalists , was disabled by a shot , and fell , crying out , “ ‘ Laissez-moi là , et portez à mes grenadiers ma chemise sanglante ’ . ” His soldiers thought he was dead , and then the error was spread , which was repeated by Wordsworth , Thiers , and Challamel . Wordsworth 's mistake is so far interesting , as it seems to prove that very little or no correspondence passed between the two friends after they had parted . Beaupuy , moreover , had too much work upon his hands to give much of his time to letter-writing .</p>
    <p n="154">Though severely wounded , Beaupuy lived on , and less than six weeks after the battle of Château-Gonthier , he was seen on the ramparts of Angers , where he required himself to be carried to animate his soldiers and head the defenders of the place , from which the Vendeans were driven after a severe contest ( Dec. 5 and 6 ) .</p>
    <p n="155">On the 22nd of December 1793 he shared in the victory of Savenay with his celebrated friends , Marceau , Kleber , and Westermann . After this battle , which put an end to the great Vendean war , he wrote the following letter to his friend Merlin de Thionville , the celebrated “ représentant du peuple . ”</p>
    <p n="156">“ SAVENAY , le 4 Nivôse au 2'e ( 25 Dec. 73 ) .</p>
    <p n="157">“ Enfin , enfin , mon cher Merlin , elle n'est plus cette armée royale ou catholique , comme tu voudras ! J'en ai vu , avec tes braves collegues Prieur et Eurreau , les débris , consistant en 150 cavaliers battant l'eau dans le marais de Montaire ; et comme tu connais ma veracité tu peux dire avec assurance que les deux combats de Savenay ont mis fin à la guerre de la nouvelle Vendée et aux chimériques espérances des royalists .</p>
    <p n="158">L'histoire ne vous presente point de combat dont le suites aient été plus décisives . Ah ! mon brave , comme tu aurais joui ! quelle attaque ! mais quelle déroute aussi ! Il fallait les voir ces soldats de Jesus et de Louis XVII , se jetant dans les marais ou obligés de se rendre par 5 ou 600 à la fois ; et Langrénière pris et les autres generaux dispersés et aux abois !</p>
    <p n="159">Cette armée , dont tu avais vu les restes de la terrasse de St. Florent , était redevenue formidable par son recrutement dans les départements envahis . Je les ai bien vus , bien examinés , j'ai reconnu même de mes figures de Chollet et de Laval , et à leur contenance et à leur mine , je l'assure qu'il ne leur manquait du soldat que l'habit . Des troupes qui ont battu de tels Français peuvent se flatter ainsi de vainere des peuples assez lâaches pour se réunir centre un seul et encore pour la cause des rois ! Enfin , je ne sais si je me trompe , mais cette guerre de brigands , de paysans , sur laquelle on a jeté tant de ridicule , que l'on dédaignait , que l'on affectait de regarder comme méprisable , m'a toujours paru , pour la république , la grande partie , et il me semble a present qu'avec nos autres ennemis , nous ne ferrons plus que peloter .</p>
    <p n="160">Adieu , brave montagnard , adieu ! Actuellement que cette exécrable guerre est terminée , que les mânes de nos freres sont satisfaits , je vais guerir . J'ai obtenu de tes confreres un congé qui finira au moment où la guerre recommencera .</p>
    <p n="161">LE GÉNERAL DE BRIGADE BEAUPUY .</p>
    <p n="162">I think I can recognize in this letter some traits of Beaupuy 's character as pointed out by Wordsworth , not excepting the half-suppressed criticism :</p>
    <p n="163">‘ ... somewhat vain he was , Or seemed so , yet it was not vanity , But fondness , and a kind of radiant joy Diffused around him ... ’</p>
    <p n="164">Passing over numerous military incidents , on the 26th of June 1796 Beaupuy received seven or eight sabre-cuts at Jorich-Wildstadt . But on the 8th of July he was already back at his post .</p>
    <p n="165">He again greatly distinguished himself on the 1st of September 1796 at Greisenfeld and Langenbruck , where the victory of the French was owing to a timely attack made by Desaix and himself .</p>
    <p n="166">He was one of the generals under Moreau when the latter achieved his well-known retreat through the Black Forest , begun on the 15th of September 1796 , and during which many battles were fought . In one of the actions on the banks of the Elz , Beaupuy was killed by a cannon-ball , while opposing General Latour on the heights of Malterdingen . His soldiers , who loved him passionately , fought desperately to avenge his death ( Oct. 19 , 1796 ) .</p>
    <p n="167">One of Beaupuy 's colleagues , General Duhem , in his account of the battle to the Government , thus expressed himself on General Beaupuy :</p>
    <p n="168">“ Ecrivains patriotes , orateurs chaleureux , je vous propose un noble sujet , l'éloge du Géneral Beaupuy , de Beaupuy , le Nestor et l'Achille de notre armée . Vous n'avez pas de récherches à faire ; interrogez le premier soldat de l'armée du Rhin-et-Moselle , ses larmes exciteront les vôtres . Ecrivez alors ce que est vous en dira , et vous peindrez le Bayard de la République Française . ”</p>
    <p n="169">Such bombastic style was then common , but what we have seen of Beaupuy in this sketch shows that he had through his career united Nestor 's prudence [ B ] with Achilles ’ bodily courage and Bayard 's chivalric spirit ,— to use the language of the time .</p>
    <p n="170">General Moreau had Beaupuy 's remains transported to Brisach , where a monument was erected to his memory in 1802 , after the peace of Lunéville .</p>
    <p n="171">In short , Beaupuy seems to have always remained worthy of the high praise bestowed on him by Wordsworth . His name is to be remembered along with those of the unspotted generals of the first years of the Revolution — Hoche , Marceau , etc .— before the craving for conquest had developed , and the love of liberty yielded to a fond admiration of Bonaparte as it did in the case of Kleber , Desaix , and so many others . [ C ]</p>
    <p n="172">N . B .— The great influence which Beaupuy exercised at that time on Wordsworth will be easily understood , if we take into account not only his real qualities , but also his age . When they met , Wordsworth was only twenty-one , Beaupuy nearly thirty-five . The grown-up man could impart much of his knowledge of life , and of the favourite authors of the time , to a youth fresh from the University — though that youth was Wordsworth .</p>
