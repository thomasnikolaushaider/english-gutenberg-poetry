    <docImprint>[ On the title-page of the second or Edinburgh edition , were these words : “ Poems , chiefly in the Scottish Dialect , by Robert Burns , printed for the Author , and sold by William Creech ,<date>1787</date>. ” The motto of the Kilmarnock edition was omitted ; a very numerous list of subscribers followed : the volume was printed by the celebrated Smellie . ] MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN : A Scottish Bard , proud of the name , and whose highest ambition is to sing in his country 's service , where shall he so properly look for patronage as to the illustrious names of his native land : those who bear the honours and inherit the virtues of their ancestors ? The poetic genius of my country found me , as the prophetic bard Elijah did Elisha — at the PLOUGH , and threw her inspiring mantle over me . She bade me sing the loves , the joys , the rural scenes and rural pleasures of my native soil , in my native tongue ; I tuned my wild , artless notes as she inspired . She whispered me to come to this ancient metropolis of Caledonia , and lay my songs under your honoured protection : I now obey her dictates . Though much indebted to your goodness , I do not approach you , my Lords and Gentlemen , in the usual style of dedication , to thank you for past favours : that path is so hackneyed by prostituted learning that honest rusticity is ashamed of it . Nor do I present this address with the venal soul of a servile author , looking for a continuation of those favours : I was bred to the plough , and am independent . I come to claim the common Scottish name with you , my illustrious countrymen ; and to tell the world that I glory in the title . I come to congratulate my country that the blood of her ancient heroes still runs uncontaminated , and that from your courage , knowledge , and public spirit , she may expect protection , wealth , and liberty . In the last place , I come to proffer my warmest wishes to the great fountain of honour , the Monarch of the universe , for your welfare and happiness . When you go forth to waken the echoes , in the ancient and favourite amusement of your forefathers , may Pleasure ever be of your party : and may social joy await your return ! When harassed in courts or camps with the jostlings of bad men and bad measures , may the honest consciousness of injured worth attend your return to your native seats ; and may domestic happiness , with a smiling welcome , meet you at your gates ! May corruption shrink at your kindling indignant glance ; and may tyranny in the ruler , and licentiousness in the people , equally find you an inexorable foe ! I have the honour to be , With the sincerest gratitude and highest respect , My Lords and Gentlemen , Your most devoted humble servant ,</docImprint>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">I cannot give to my country this edition of one of its favourite poets , without stating that I have deliberately omitted several pieces of verse ascribed to Burns by other editors , who too hastily , and I think on insufficient testimony , admitted them among his works . If I am unable to share in the hesitation expressed by one of them on the authorship of the stanzas on “ Pastoral Poetry , ” I can as little share in the feelings with which they have intruded into the charmed circle of his poetry such compositions as “ Lines on the Ruins of Lincluden College , ” “ Verses on the Destruction of the Woods of Drumlanrig , ” “ Verses written on a Marble Slab in the Woods of Aberfeldy , ” and those entitled “ The Tree of Liberty . ” These productions , with the exception of the last , were never seen by any one even in the handwriting of Burns , and are one and all wanting in that original vigour of language and manliness of sentiment which distinguish his poetry . With respect to “ The Tree of Liberty ” in particular , a subject dear to the heart of the Bard , can any one conversant with his genius imagine that he welcomed its growth or celebrated its fruit with such “ capon craws ” as these ?</p>
    <p n="2">“ Upo ’ this tree there grows sic fruit , Its virtues a ’ can tell , man ; It raises man aboon the brute , It mak 's him ken himsel ’ , man . Gif ance the peasant taste a bit , He 's greater than a lord , man , An ’ wi ’ a beggar shares a mite O ’ a ’ he can afford , man . ”</p>
    <p n="3">There are eleven stanzas , of which the best , compared with the “ A man 's a man for a ’ that ” of Burns , sounds like a cracked pipkin against the “ heroic clang ” of a Damascus blade . That it is extant in the handwriting of the poet cannot be taken as a proof that it is his own composition , against the internal testimony of utter want of all the marks by which we know him — the Burns-stamp , so to speak , which is visible on all that ever came from his pen . Misled by his handwriting , I inserted in my former edition of his works an epitaph , beginning</p>
    <p n="4">“ Here lies a rose , a budding rose , ”</p>
    <p n="5">the composition of Shenstone , and which is to be found in the church-yard of Hales-Owen : as it is not included in every edition of that poet 's acknowledged works , Burns , who was an admirer of his genius , had , it seems , copied it with his own hand , and hence my error . If I hesitated about the exclusion of “ The Tree of Liberty , ” and its three false brethren , I could have no scruples regarding the fine song of “ Evan Banks , ” claimed and justly for Miss Williams by Sir Walter Scott , or the humorous song called “ Shelah O'Neal , ” composed by the late Sir Alexander Boswell . When I have stated that I have arranged the Poems , the Songs , and the Letters of Burns , as nearly as possible in the order in which they were written ; that I have omitted no piece of either verse or prose which bore the impress of his hand , nor included any by which his high reputation would likely be impaired , I have said all that seems necessary to be said , save that the following letter came too late for insertion in its proper place : it is characteristic and worth a place anywhere .</p>

    <docImprint>Mossgiel , 13th Nov.<date>1786</date>. DEAR SIR , I have along with this sent the two volumes of Ossian , with the remaining volume of the Songs . Ossian I am not in such a hurry about ; but I wish the Songs , with the volume of the Scotch Poets , returned as soon as they can conveniently be dispatched . If they are left at Mr. Wilson , the bookseller 's shop , Kilmarnock , they will easily reach me . My most respectful compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Laurie ; and a Poet 's warmest wishes for their happiness to the young ladies ; particularly the fair musician , whom I think much better qualified than ever David was , or could be , to charm an evil spirit out of a Saul . Indeed , it needs not the Feelings of a poet to be interested in the welfare of one of the sweetest scenes of domestic peace and kindred love that ever I saw ; as I think the peaceful unity of St. Margaret 's Hill can only be excelled by the harmonious concord of the Apocalyptic Zion . I am , dear Sir , yours sincerely ,</docImprint>

   <p>LIFE</p>
   <p>OF</p>
   <p>ROBERT BURNS .</p>
   <p>Robert Burns , the chief of the peasant poets of Scotland , was born in a little mud-walled cottage on the banks of Doon , near “ Alloway 's auld haunted kirk , ” in the shire of Ayr , on the 25th day of January , 1759 . As a natural mark of the event , a sudden storm at the same moment swept the land : the gabel-wall of the frail dwelling gave way , and the babe-bard was hurried through a tempest of wind and sleet to the shelter of a securer hovel . He was the eldest born of three sons and three daughters ; his father , William , who in his native Kincardineshire wrote his name Burness , was bred a gardener , and sought for work in the West ; but coming from the lands of the noble family of the Keiths , a suspicion accompanied him that he had been out — as rebellion was softly called — in the forty-five : a suspicion fatal to his hopes of rest and bread , in so loyal a district ; and it was only when the clergyman of his native parish certified his loyalty that he was permitted to toil . This suspicion of Jacobitism , revived by Burns himself , when he rose into fame , seems not to have influenced either the feelings , or the tastes of Agnes Brown , a young woman on the Doon , whom he wooed and married in December , 1757 , when he was thirty-six years old . To support her , he leased a small piece of ground , which he converted into a nursery and garden , and to shelter her , he raised with his own hands that humble abode where she gave birth to her eldest son .</p>
   <p>The elder Burns was a well-informed , silent , austere man , who endured no idle gaiety , nor indecorous language : while he relaxed somewhat the hard , stern creed of the Covenanting times , he enforced all the work-day , as well as sabbath-day observances , which the Calvinistic kirk requires , and scrupled at promiscuous dancing , as the staid of our own day scruple at the waltz . His wife was of a milder mood : she was blest with a singular fortitude of temper ; was as devout of heart , as she was calm of mind ; and loved , while busied in her household concerns , to sweeten the bitterer moments of life , by chanting the songs and ballads of her country , of which her store was great . The garden and nursery prospered so much , that he was induced to widen his views , and by the help of his kind landlord , the laird of Doonholm , and the more questionable aid of borrowed money , he entered upon a neighbouring farm , named Mount Oliphant , extending to an hundred acres . This was in 1765 ; but the land was hungry and sterile ; the seasons proved rainy and rough ; the toil was certain , the reward unsure ; when to his sorrow , the laird of Doonholm — a generous Ferguson ,— died : the strict terms of the lease , as well as the rent , were exacted by a harsh factor , and with his wife and children , he was obliged , after a losing struggle of six years , to relinquish the farm , and seek shelter on the grounds of Lochlea , some ten miles off , in the parish of Tarbolton . When , in after-days , men 's characters were in the hands of his eldest son , the scoundrel factor sat for that lasting portrait of insolence and wrong , in the “ Twa Dogs . ”</p>
   <p>In this new farm William Burns seemed to strike root , and thrive . He was strong of body and ardent of mind : every day brought increase of vigour to his three sons , who , though very young , already put their hands to the plough , the reap-hook , and the flail . But it seemed that nothing which he undertook was decreed in the end to prosper : after four seasons of prosperity a change ensued : the farm was far from cheap ; the gains under any lease were then so little , that the loss of a few pounds was ruinous to a farmer : bad seed and wet seasons had their usual influence : “ The gloom of hermits and the moil of galley-slaves , ” as the poet , alluding to those days , said , were endured to no purpose ; when , to crown all , a difference arose between the landlord and the tenant , as to the terms of the lease ; and the early days of the poet , and the declining years of his father , were harassed by disputes , in which sensitive minds are sure to suffer .</p>
   <p>Amid these labours and disputes , the poet 's father remembered the worth of religious and moral instruction : he took part of this upon himself . A week-day in Lochlea wore the sober looks of a Sunday : he read the Bible and explained , as intelligent peasants are accustomed to do , the sense , when dark or difficult ; he loved to discuss the spiritual meanings , and gaze on the mystical splendours of the Revelations . He was aided in these labours , first , by the schoolmaster of Alloway-mill , near the Doon ; secondly , by John Murdoch , student of divinity , who undertook to teach arithmetic , grammar , French , and Latin , to the boys of Lochlea , and the sons of five neighboring farmers . Murdoch , who was an enthusiast in learning , much of a pedant , and such a judge of genius that he thought wit should always be laughing , and poetry wear an eternal smile , performed his task well : he found Robert to be quick in apprehension , and not afraid to study when knowledge was the reward . He taught him to turn verse into its natural prose order ; to supply all the ellipses , and not to desist till the sense was clear and plain : he also , in their walks , told him the names of different objects both in Latin and French ; and though his knowledge of these languages never amounted to much , he approached the grammar of the English tongue , through the former , which was of material use to him , in his poetic compositions . Burns was , even in those early days , a sort of enthusiast in all that concerned the glory of Scotland ; he used to fancy himself a soldier of the days of the Wallace and the Bruce : loved to strut after the bag-pipe and the drum , and read of the bloody struggles of his country for freedom and existence , till “ a Scottish prejudice , ” he says , “ was poured into my veins , which will boil there till the flood-gates of life are shut in eternal rest . ”</p>
   <p>In this mood of mind Burns was unconsciously approaching the land of poesie . In addition to the histories of the Wallace and the Bruce , he found , on the shelves of his neighbours , not only whole bodies of divinity , and sermons without limit , but the works of some of the best English , as well as Scottish poets , together with songs and ballads innumerable . On these he loved to pore whenever a moment of leisure came ; nor was verse his sole favourite ; he desired to drink knowledge at any fountain , and Guthrie 's Grammar , Dickson on Agriculture , Addison 's Spectator , Locke on the Human Understanding , and Taylor 's Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin , were as welcome to his heart as Shakspeare , Milton , Pope , Thomson , and Young . There is a mystery in the workings of genius : with these poets in his head and hand , we see not that he has advanced one step in the way in which he was soon to walk , “ Highland Mary ” and “ Tam O ’ Shanter ” sprang from other inspirations .</p>
   <p>Burns lifts up the veil himself , from the studies which made him a poet . “ In my boyish days , ” he says to Moore , “ I owed much to an old woman ( Jenny Wilson ) who resided in the family , remarkable for her credulity and superstition . She had , I suppose , the largest collection in the country of tales and songs , concerning devils , ghosts , fairies , brownies , witches , warlocks , spunkies , kelpies , elf-candles , dead-lights , wraiths , apparitions , cantraips , giants , enchanted towers , dragons , and other trumpery . This cultivated the latent seeds of poesie ; but had so strong an effect upon my imagination that to this hour , in my nocturnal rambles , I sometimes keep a look-out on suspicious places . ” Here we have the young poet taking lessons in the classic lore of his native land : in the school of Janet Wilson he profited largely ; her tales gave a hue , all their own , to many noble effusions . But her teaching was at the hearth-stone : when he was in the fields , either driving a cart or walking to labour , he had ever in his hand a collection of songs , such as any stall in the land could supply him with ; and over these he pored , ballad by ballad , and verse by verse , noting the true , tender , and the natural sublime from affectation and fustian . “ To this , ” he said , “ I am convinced that I owe much of my critic craft , such as it is . ” His mother , too , unconsciously led him in the ways of the muse : she loved to recite or sing to him a strange , but clever ballad , called “ the Life and Age of Man : ” this strain of piety and imagination was in his mind when he wrote “ Man was made to Mourn . ”</p>
   <p>He found other teachers — of a tenderer nature and softer influence . “ You know , ” he says to Moore , “ our country custom of coupling a man and woman together as partners in the labours of harvest . In my fifteenth autumn my partner was a bewitching creature , a year younger than myself : she was in truth a bonnie , sweet , sonsie lass , and unwittingly to herself , initiated me in that delicious passion , which , in spite of acid disappointment , gin-horse prudence , and bookworm philosophy , I hold to be the first of human joys . How she caught the contagion I cannot tell ; I never expressly said I loved her : indeed I did not know myself why I liked so much to loiter behind with her , when returning in the evenings from our labours ; why the tones of her voice made my heart strings thrill like an Æolian harp , and particularly why my pulse beat such a furious ratan , when I looked and fingered over her little hand , to pick out the cruel nettle-stings and thistles . Among other love-inspiring qualities , she sang sweetly , and it was her favourite reel to which I attempted to give an embodied vehicle in rhyme ; thus with me began love and verse . ” This intercourse with the fair part of the creation , was to his slumbering emotions , a voice from heaven to call them into life and poetry .</p>
   <p>From the school of traditionary lore and love , Burns now went to a rougher academy . Lochlea , though not producing fine crops of corn , was considered excellent for flax ; and while the cultivation of this commodity was committed to his father and his brother Gilbert , he was sent to Irvine at Midsummer , 1781 , to learn the trade of a flax-dresser , under one Peacock , kinsman to his mother . Some time before , he had spent a portion of a summer at a school in Kirkoswald , learning mensuration and land-surveying , where he had mingled in scenes of sociality with smugglers , and enjoyed the pleasure of a silent walk , under the moon , with the young and the beautiful . At Irvine he laboured by day to acquire a knowledge of his business , and at night he associated with the gay and the thoughtless , with whom he learnt to empty his glass , and indulge in free discourse on topics forbidden at Lochlea . He had one small room for a lodging , for which he gave a shilling a week : meat he seldom tasted , and his food consisted chiefly of oatmeal and potatoes sent from his father 's house . In a letter to his father , written with great purity and simplicity of style , he thus gives a picture of himself , mental and bodily : “ Honoured Sir , I have purposely delayed writing , in the hope that I should have the pleasure of seeing you on new years ’ day , but work comes so hard upon us that I do not choose to be absent on that account . My health is nearly the same as when you were here , only my sleep is a little sounder , and on the whole , I am rather better than otherwise , though I mend by very slow degrees : the weakness of my nerves had so debilitated my mind that I dare neither review past wants nor look forward into futurity , for the least anxiety or perturbation in my breast produces most unhappy effects on my whole frame . Sometimes indeed , when for an hour or two my spirits are a little lightened , I glimmer a little into futurity ; but my principal and indeed my only pleasurable employment is looking backwards and forwards in a moral and religious way . I am quite transported at the thought that ere long , perhaps very soon , I shall bid an eternal adieu to all the pains and uneasinesses , and disquietudes of this weary life . As for the world , I despair of ever making a figure in it : I am not formed for the bustle of the busy , nor the flutter of the gay . I foresee that poverty and obscurity probably await me , and I am in some measure prepared and daily preparing to meet them . I have but just time and paper to return you my grateful thanks for the lessons of virtue and piety you have given me , which were but too much neglected at the time of giving them , but which , I hope , have been remembered ere it is yet too late . ” This remarkable letter was written in the twenty-second year of his age ; it alludes to the illness which seems to have been the companion of his youth , a nervous headache , brought on by constant toil and anxiety ; and it speaks of the melancholy which is the common attendant of genius , and its sensibilities , aggravated by despair of distinction . The catastrophe which happened ere this letter was well in his father 's hand , accords ill with quotations from the Bible , and hopes fixed in heaven :— “ As we gave , ” he says , “ a welcome carousal to the new year , the shop took fire , and burnt to ashes , and I was left , like a true poet , not worth a sixpence . ”</p>
   <p>This disaster was followed by one more grievous : his father was well in years when he was married , and age and a constitution injured by toil and disappointment , began to press him down , ere his sons had grown up to man 's estate . On all sides the clouds began to darken : the farm was unprosperous : the speculations in flax failed ; and the landlord of Lochlea , raising a question upon the meaning of the lease , concerning rotation of crop , pushed the matter to a lawsuit , alike ruinous to a poor man either in its success or its failure . “ After three years tossing and whirling , ” says Burns , “ in the vortex of litigation , my father was just saved from the horrors of a jail by a consumption , which , after two years ’ promises , kindly slept in and carried him away to where the ‘ wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest . ’ His all went among the hell-hounds that prowl in the kennel of justice . The finishing evil which brought up the rear of this infernal file , was my constitutional melancholy being increased to such a degree , that for three months I was in a state of mind scarcely to be envied by the hopeless wretches who have got their mittimus , ‘ Depart from me , ye cursed . ’ ”</p>
   <p>Robert Burns was now the head of his father 's house . He gathered together the little that law and misfortune had spared , and took the farm of Mossgiel , near Mauchline , containing one hundred and eighteen acres , at a rent of ninety pounds a year : his mother and sisters took the domestic superintendence of home , barn , and byre ; and he associated his brother Gilbert in the labours of the land . It was made a joint affair : the poet was young , willing , and vigorous , and excelled in ploughing , sowing , reaping , mowing , and thrashing . His wages were fixed at seven pounds per annum , and such for a time was his care and frugality , that he never exceeded this small allowance . He purchased books on farming , held conversations with the old and the knowing ; and said unto himself , “ I shall be prudent and wise , and my shadow shall increase in the land . ” But it was not decreed that these resolutions were to endure , and that he was to become a mighty agriculturist in the west . Farmer Attention , as the proverb says , is a good farmer , all the world over , and Burns was such by fits and by starts . But he who writes an ode on the sheep he is about to shear , a poem on the flower that he covers with the furrow , who sees visions on his way to market , who makes rhymes on the horse he is about to yoke , and a song on the girl who shows the whitest hands among his reapers , has small chance of leading a market , or of being laird of the fields he rents . The dreams of Burns were of the muses , and not of rising markets , of golden locks rather than of yellow corn : he had other faults . It is not known that William Burns was aware before his death that his eldest son had sinned in rhyme ; but we have Gilbert 's assurance , that his father went to the grave in ignorance of his son 's errors of a less venial kind — unwitting that he was soon to give a two-fold proof of both in “ Rob the Rhymer 's Address to his Bastard Child ” — a poem less decorous than witty .</p>
   <p>The dress and condition of Burns when he became a poet were not at all poetical , in the minstrel meaning of the word . His clothes , coarse and homely , were made from home-grown wool , shorn off his own sheeps ’ backs , carded and spun at his own fireside , woven by the village weaver , and , when not of natural hodden-gray , dyed a half-blue in the village vat . They were shaped and sewed by the district tailor , who usually wrought at the rate of a groat a day and his food ; and as the wool was coarse , so also was the workmanship . The linen which he wore was home-grown , home-hackled , home-spun , home-woven , and home-bleached , and , unless designed for Sunday use , was of coarse , strong harn , to suit the tear and wear of barn and field . His shoes came from rustic tanpits , for most farmers then prepared their own leather ; were armed , sole and heel , with heavy , broad-headed nails , to endure the clod and the road : as hats were then little in use , save among small lairds or country gentry , westland heads were commonly covered with a coarse , broad , blue bonnet , with a stopple on its flat crown , made in thousands at Kilmarnock , and known in all lands by the name of scone bonnets . His plaid was a handsome red and white check — for pride in poets , he said , was no sin — prepared of fine wool with more than common care by the hands of his mother and sisters , and woven with more skill than the village weaver was usually required to exert . His dwelling was in keeping with his dress , a low , thatched house , with a kitchen , a bedroom and closet , with floors of kneaded clay , and ceilings of moorland turf : a few books on a shelf , thumbed by many a thumb ; a few hams drying above head in the smoke , which was in no haste to get out at the roof — a wooden settle , some oak chairs , chaff beds well covered with blankets , with a fire of peat and wood burning at a distance from the gable wall , on the middle of the floor . His food was as homely as his habitation , and consisted chiefly of oatmeal-porridge , barley-broth , and potatoes , and milk . How the muse happened to visit him in this clay biggin , take a fancy to a clouterly peasant , and teach him strains of consummate beauty and elegance , must ever be a matter of wonder to all those , and they are not few , who hold that noble sentiments and heroic deeds are the exclusive portion of the gently nursed and the far descended .</p>
   <p>Of the earlier verses of Burns few are preserved : when composed , he put them on paper , but the kept them to himself : though a poet at sixteen , he seems not to have made even his brother his confidante till he became a man , and his judgment had ripened . He , however , made a little clasped paper book his treasurer , and under the head of “ Observations , Hints , Songs , and Scraps of Poetry , ” we find many a wayward and impassioned verse , songs rising little above the humblest country strain , or bursting into an elegance and a beauty worthy of the highest of minstrels . The first words noted down are the stanzas which he composed on his fair companion of the harvest-field , out of whose hands he loved to remove the nettle-stings and the thistles : the prettier song , beginning “ Now westlin win 's and slaughtering guns , ” written on the lass of Kirkoswald , with whom , instead of learning mensuration , he chose to wander under the light of the moon : a strain better still , inspired by the charms of a neighbouring maiden , of the name of Annie Ronald ; another , of equal merit , arising out of his nocturnal adventures among the lasses of the west ; and , finally , that crowning glory of all his lyric compositions , “ Green grow the rashes . ” This little clasped book , however , seems not to have been made his confidante till his twenty-third or twenty-fourth year : he probably admitted to its pages only the strains which he loved most , or such as had taken a place in his memory : at whatever age it was commenced , he had then begun to estimate his own character , and intimate his fortunes , for he calls himself in its pages “ a man who had little art in making money , and still less in keeping it . ”</p>
   <p>We have not been told how welcome the incense of his songs rendered him to the rustic maidens of Kyle : women are not apt to be won by the charms of verse ; they have little sympathy with dreamers on Parnassus , and allow themselves to be influenced by something more substantial than the roses and lilies of the muse . Burns had other claims to their regard then those arising from poetic skill : he was tall , young , good-looking , with dark , bright eyes , and words and wit at will : he had a sarcastic sally for all lads who presumed to cross his path , and a soft , persuasive word for all lasses on whom he fixed his fancy : nor was this all — he was adventurous and bold in love trystes and love excursions : long , rough roads , stormy nights , flooded rivers , and lonesome places , were no letts to him ; and when the dangers or labours of the way were braved , he was alike skilful in eluding vigilant aunts , wakerife mothers , and envious or suspicions sisters : for rivals he had a blow as ready us he had a word , and was familiar with snug stack-yards , broomy glens , and nooks of hawthorn and honeysuckle , where maidens love to be wooed . This rendered him dearer to woman 's heart than all the lyric effusions of his fancy ; and when we add to such allurements , a warm , flowing , and persuasive eloquence , we need not wonder that woman listened and was won ; that one of the most charming damsels of the West said , an hour with him in the dark was worth a lifetime of light with any other body ; or that the accomplished and beautiful Duchess of Gordon declared , in a latter day , that no man ever carried her so completely off her feet as Robert Burns .</p>
   <p>It is one of the delusions of the poet 's critics and biographers , that the sources of his inspiration are to be found in the great classic poets of the land , with some of whom he had from his youth been familiar : there is little or no trace of them in any of his compositions . He read and wondered — he warmed his fancy at their flame , he corrected his own natural taste by theirs , but he neither copied nor imitated , and there are but two or three allusions to Young and Shakspeare in all the range of his verse . He could not but feel that he was the scholar of a different school , and that his thirst was to be slaked at other fountains . The language in which those great bards embodied their thoughts was unapproachable to an Ayrshire peasant ; it was to him as an almost foreign tongue : he had to think and feel in the not ungraceful or inharmonious language of his own vale , and then , in a manner , translate it into that of Pope or of Thomson , with the additional difficulty of finding English words to express the exact meaning of those of Scotland , which had chiefly been retained because equivalents could not be found in the more elegant and grammatical tongue . Such strains as those of the polished Pope or the sublimer Milton were beyond his power , less from deficiency of genius than from lack of language : he could , indeed , write English with ease and fluency ; but when he desired to be tender or impassioned , to persuade or subdue , he had recourse to the Scottish , and he found it sufficient .</p>
   <p>The goddesses or the Dalilahs of the young poet 's song were , like the language in which he celebrated them , the produce of the district ; not dames high and exalted , but lasses of the barn and of the byre , who had never been in higher company than that of shepherds or ploughmen , or danced in a politer assembly than that of their fellow-peasants , on a barn-floor , to the sound of the district fiddle . Nor even of these did he choose the loveliest to lay out the wealth of his verse upon : he has been accused , by his brother among others , of lavishing the colours of his fancy on very ordinary faces . “ He had always , ” says Gilbert , “ a jealousy of people who were richer than himself ; his love , therefore , seldom settled on persons of this description . When he selected any one , out of the sovereignty of his good pleasure , to whom he should pay his particular attention , she was instantly invested with a sufficient stock of charms out of the plentiful stores of his own imagination : and there was often a great dissimilitude between his fair captivator , as she appeared to others and as she seemed when invested with the attributes he gave her . ” “ My heart , ” he himself , speaking of those days , observes , “ was completely tinder , and was eternally lighted up by some goddess or other . ” Yet , it must be acknowledged that sufficient room exists for believing that Burns and his brethren of the West had very different notions of the captivating and the beautiful ; while they were moved by rosy checks and looks of rustic health , he was moved , like a sculptor , by beauty of form or by harmony of motion , and by expression , which lightened up ordinary features and rendered them captivating . Such , I have been told , were several of the lasses of the West , to whom , if he did not surrender his heart , he rendered homage : and both elegance of form and beauty of face were visible to all in those of whom he afterwards sang — the Hamiltons and the Burnets of Edinburgh , and the Millers and M'Murdos of the Nith .</p>
   <p>The mind of Burns took now a wider range : he had sung of the maidens of Kyle in strains not likely soon to die , and though not weary of the softnesses of love , he desired to try his genius on matters of a sterner kind — what those subjects were he tells us ; they were homely and at hand , of a native nature and of Scottish growth : places celebrated in Roman story , vales made famous in Grecian song — hills of vines and groves of myrtle had few charms for him . “ I am hurt , ” thus he writes in August , 1785 , “ to see other towns , rivers , woods , and haughs of Scotland immortalized in song , while my dear native county , the ancient Baillieries of Carrick , Kyle , and Cunningham , famous in both ancient and modern times for a gallant and warlike race of inhabitants — a county where civil and religious liberty have ever found their first support and their asylum — a county , the birth-place of many famous philosophers , soldiers , and statesmen , and the scene of many great events recorded in history , particularly the actions of the glorious Wallace — yet we have never had one Scotch poet of any eminence to make the fertile banks of Irvine , the romantic woodlands and sequestered scenes of Ayr . and the mountainous source and winding sweep of the Doon , emulate Tay , Forth , Ettrick , and Tweed . This is a complaint I would gladly remedy , but , alas ! I am far unequal to the task , both in genius and education . ” To fill up with glowing verse the outline which this sketch indicates , was to raise the long-laid spirit of national song — to waken a strain to which the whole land would yield response — a miracle unattempted — certainly unperformed — since the days of the Gentle Shepherd . It is true that the tongue of the muse had at no time been wholly silent ; that now and then a burst of sublime woe , like the song of “ Mary , weep no more for me , ” and of lasting merriment and humour , like that of “ Tibbie Fowler , ” proved that the fire of natural poesie smouldered , if it did not blaze ; while the social strains of the unfortunate Fergusson revived in the city , if not in the field , the memory of him who sang the “ Monk and the Miller 's wife . ” But notwithstanding these and other productions of equal merit , Scottish poesie , it must be owned , had lost much of its original ecstasy and fervour , and that the boldest efforts of the muse no more equalled the songs of Dunbar , of Douglas , of Lyndsay , and of James the Fifth , than the sound of an artificial cascade resembles the undying thunders of Corra .</p>
   <p>To accomplish this required an acquaintance with man beyond what the forge , the change-house , and the market-place of the village supplied ; a look further than the barn-yard and the furrowed field , and a livelier knowledge and deeper feeling of history than , probably , Burns ever possessed . To all ready and accessible sources of knowledge he appears to have had recourse ; he sought matter for his muse in the meetings , religious as well as social , of the district — consorted with staid matrons , grave plodding farmers — with those who preached as well as those who listened — with sharp-tongued attorneys , who laid down the law over a Mauchline gill — with country squires , whose wisdom was great in the game-laws , and in contested elections — and with roving smugglers , who at that time hung , as a cloud , on all the western coast of Scotland . In the company of farmers and fellow-peasants , he witnessed scenes which he loved to embody in verse , saw pictures of peace and joy , now woven into the web of his song , and had a poetic impulse given to him both by cottage devotion and cottage merriment . If he was familiar with love and all its outgoings and incomings — had met his lass in the midnight shade , or walked with her under the moon , or braved a stormy night and a haunted road for her sake — he was as well acquainted with the joys which belong to social intercourse , when instruments of music speak to the feet , when the reek of punchbowls gives a tongue to the staid and demure , and bridal festivity , and harvest-homes , bid a whole valley lift up its voice and be glad . It is more difficult to decide what poetic use he could make of his intercourse with that loose and lawless class of men , who , from love of gain , broke the laws and braved the police of their country : that he found among smugglers , as he says , “ men of noble virtues , magnanimity , generosity , disinterested friendship , and modesty , ” is easier to believe than that he escaped the contamination of their sensual manners and prodigality . The people of Kyle regarded this conduct with suspicion : they were not to be expected to know that when Burns ranted and housed with smugglers , conversed with tinkers huddled in a kiln , or listened to the riotous mirth of a batch of “ randie gangrel bodies ” as they “ toomed their powks and pawned their duds , ” for liquor in Poosie Nansie 's , he was taking sketches for the future entertainment and instruction of the world ; they could not foresee that from all this moral strength and poetic beauty would arise .</p>
   <p>While meditating something better than a ballad to his mistress 's eyebrow , he did not neglect to lay out the little skill he had in cultivating the grounds of Mossgiel . The prosperity in which he found himself in the first and second seasons , induced him to hope that good fortune had not yet forsaken him : a genial summer and a good market seldom come together to the farmer , but at first they came to Burns ; and to show that he was worthy of them , he bought books on agriculture , calculated rotation of crops , attended sales , held the plough with diligence , used the scythe , the reap-hook , and the flail , with skill , and the malicious even began to say that there was something more in him than wild sallies of wit and foolish rhymes . But the farm lay high , the bottom was wet , and in a third season , indifferent seed and a wet harvest robbed him at once of half his crop : he seems to have regarded this as an intimation from above , that nothing which he undertook would prosper : and consoled himself with joyous friends and with the society of the muse . The judgment cannot be praised which selected a farm with a wet cold bottom , and sowed it with unsound seed ; but that man who despairs because a wet season robs him of the fruits of the field , is unfit for the warfare of life , where fortitude is as much required as by a general on a field of battle , when the tide of success threatens to flow against him . The poet seems to have believed , very early in life , that he was none of the elect of Mammon ; that he was too much of a genius ever to acquire wealth by steady labour , or by , as he loved to call it , gin-horse prudence , or grubbing industry .</p>
   <p>And yet there were hours and days in which Burns , even when the rain fell on his unhoused sheaves , did not wholly despair of himself : he laboured , nay sometimes he slaved on his farm ; and at intervals of toil , sought to embellish his mind with such knowledge as might be useful , should chance , the goddess who ruled his lot , drop him upon some of the higher places of the land . He had , while he lived at Tarbolton , united with some half-dozen young men , all sons of farmers in that neighbourhood , in forming a club , of which the object was to charm away a few evening hours in the week with agreeable chit-chat , and the discussion of topics of economy or love . Of this little society the poet was president , and the first question they were called on to settle was this , “ Suppose a young man bred a farmer , but without any fortune , has it in his power to marry either of two women ; the one a girl of large fortune , but neither handsome in person , nor agreeable in conversation , but who can manage the household affairs of a farm well enough ; the other of them , a girl every way agreeable in person , conversation , and behaviour , but without any fortune , which of them shall he choose ? ” This question was started by the poet , and once every week the club were called to the consideration of matters connected with rural life and industry : their expenses were limited to threepence a week ; and till the departure of Burns to the distant Mossgiel , the club continued to live and thrive ; on his removal it lost the spirit which gave it birth , and was heard of no more ; but its aims and its usefulness were revived in Mauchline , where the poet was induced to establish a society which only differed from the other in spending the moderate fines arising from non-attendance , on books , instead of liquor . Here , too , Burns was the president , and the members were chiefly the sons of husbandmen , whom he found , he said , more natural in their manners , and more agreeable than the self-sufficient mechanics of villages and towns , who were ready to dispute on all topics , and inclined to be convinced on none . This club had the pleasure of subscribing for the first edition of the works of its great associate . It has been questioned by his first biographer , whether the refinement of mind , which follows the reading of books of eloquence and delicacy ,— the mental improvement resulting from such calm discussions as the Tarbolton and Mauchline clubs indulged in , was not injurious to men engaged in the barn and at the plough . A well-ordered mind will be strengthened , as well as embellished , by elegant knowledge , while over those naturally barren and ungenial all that is refined or noble will pass as a sunny shower scuds over lumps of granite , bringing neither warmth nor life .</p>
   <p>In the account which the poet gives to Moore of his early poems , he says little about his exquisite lyrics , and less about “ The Death and dying Words of Poor Mailie , ” or her “ Elegy , ” the first of his poems where the inspiration of the muse is visible ; but he speaks with exultation of the fame which those indecorous sallies , “ Holy Willie 's Prayer ” and “ The Holy Tulzie ” brought from some of the clergy , and the people of Ayrshire . The west of Scotland is ever in the van , when mutters either political or religious are agitated . Calvinism was shaken , at this time , with a controversy among its professors , of which it is enough to say , that while one party rigidly adhered to the word and letter of the Confession of Faith , and preached up the palmy and wholesome days of the Covenant , the other sought to soften the harsher rules and observances of the kirk , and to bring moderation and charity into its discipline as well as its councils . Both believed themselves right , both were loud and hot , and personal ,— bitter with a bitterness only known in religious controversy . The poet sided with the professors of the New Light , as the more tolerant were called , and handled the professors of the Old Light , as the other party were named , with the most unsparing severity . For this he had sufficient cause :— he had experienced the mercilessness of kirk-discipline , when his frailties caused him to visit the stool of repentance ; and moreover his friend Gavin Hamilton , a writer in Mauchline , had been sharply censured by the same authorities , for daring to gallop on Sundays . Moodie , of Riccarton , and Russel , of Kilmarnock , were the first who tasted of the poet 's wrath . They , though professors of the Old Light , had quarrelled , and , it is added , fought : “ The Holy Tulzie , ” which recorded , gave at the same time wings to the scandal ; while for “ Holy Willie , ” an elder of Mauchline , and an austere and hollow pretender to righteousness , he reserved the fiercest of all his lampoons . In “ Holy Willie 's Prayer , ” he lays a burning hand on the terrible doctrine of predestination : this is a satire , daring , personal , and profane . Willie claims praise in the singular , acknowledges folly in the plural , and makes heaven accountable for his sins ! in a similar strain of undevout satire , he congratulates Goudie , of Kilmarnock , on his Essays on Revealed Religion . These poems , particularly the two latter , are the sharpest lampoons in the language .</p>
   <p>While drudging in the cause of the New Light controversialists , Burns was not unconsciously strengthening his hands for worthier toils : the applause which selfish divines bestowed on his witty , but graceless effusions , could not be enough for one who knew how fleeting the fame was which came from the heat of party disputes ; nor was he insensible that songs of a beauty unknown for a century to national poesy , had been unregarded in the hue and cry which arose on account of “ Holy Willie 's Prayer ” and “ The Holy Tulzie . ” He hesitated to drink longer out of the agitated puddle of Calvinistic controversy , he resolved to slake his thirst at the pure well-springs of patriot feeling and domestic love ; and accordingly , in the last and best of his controversial compositions , he rose out of the lower regions of lampoon into the upper air of true poetry . “ The Holy Fair , ” though stained in one or two verses with personalities , exhibits a scene glowing with character and incident and life : the aim of the poem is not so much to satirize one or two Old Light divines , as to expose and rebuke those almost indecent festivities , which in too many of the western parishes accompanied the administration of the sacrament . In the earlier days of the church , when men were staid and sincere , it was , no doubt , an impressive sight to see rank succeeding rank , of the old and the young , all calm and all devout , seated before the tent of the preacher , in the sunny hours of June , listening to his eloquence , or partaking of the mystic bread and wine ; but in these our latter days , when discipline is relaxed , along with the sedate and the pious come swarms of the idle and the profligate , whom no eloquence can edify and no solemn rite affect . On these , and such as these , the poet has poured his satire ; and since this desirable reprehension the Holy Fairs , east as well as west , have become more decorous , if not more devout .</p>
   <p>His controversial sallies were accompanied , or followed , by a series of poems which showed that national character and manners , as Lockhart has truly and happily said , were once more in the hands of a national poet . These compositions are both numerous and various : they record the poet 's own experience and emotions ; they exhibit the highest moral feeling , the purest patriotic sentiments , and a deep sympathy with the fortunes , both here and hereafter of his fellow-men ; they delineate domestic manners , man 's stern as well as social hours , and mingle the serious with the joyous , the sarcastic with the solemn , the mournful with the pathetic , the amiable with the gay , and all with an ease and unaffected force and freedom known only to the genius of Shakspeare . In “ The Twa Dogs ” he seeks to reconcile the labourer to his lot , and intimates , by examples drawn from the hall as well as the cottage , that happiness resides in the humblest abodes , and is even partial to the clouted shoe . In “ Scotch Drink ” he excites man to love his country , by precepts both heroic and social ; and proves that while wine and brandy are the tipple of slaves , whiskey and ale are the drink of the free : sentiments of a similar kind distinguish his “ Earnest Cry and Prayer to the Scotch Representatives in the House of Commons , ” each of whom he exhorts by name to defend the remaining liberties and immunities of his country . A higher tone distinguishes the “ Address to the Deil : ” he records all the names , and some of them are strange ones ; and all the acts , and some of them are as whimsical as they are terrible , of this far kenned and noted personage ; to these he adds some of the fiend 's doings as they stand in Scripture , together with his own experiences ; and concludes by a hope , as unexpected as merciful and relenting , that Satan may not be exposed to an eternity of torments . “ The Dream ” is a humorous sally , and may be almost regarded as prophetic . The poet feigns himself present , in slumber , at the Royal birth-day ; and supposes that he addresses his majesty , on his household matters as well as the affairs of the nation . Some of the princes , it has been satirically hinted , behaved afterwards in such a way as if they wished that the scripture of the Burns should be fulfilled : in this strain , he has imitated the license and equalled the wit of some of the elder Scottish Poets .</p>
   <p>“ The Vision ” is wholly serious ; it exhibits the poet in one of those fits of despondency which the dull , who have no misgivings , never know : he dwells with sarcastic bitterness on the opportunities which , for the sake of song , he has neglected of becoming wealthy , and is drawing a sad parallel between rags and riches , when the muse steps in and cheer his despondency , by assuring him of undying fame . “ Halloween ” is a strain of a more homely kind , recording the superstitious beliefs , and no less superstitious doings of Old Scotland , on that night , when witches and elves and evil spirits are let loose among the children of men : it reaches far back into manners and customs , and is a picture , curious and valuable . The tastes and feelings of husbandmen inspired “ The old Farmer 's Address to his old mare Maggie , ” which exhibits some pleasing recollections of his days of courtship and hours of sociality . The calm , tranquil picture of household happiness and devotion in “ the Cotter 's Saturday Night , ” has induced Hogg , among others , to believe that it has less than usual of the spirit of the poet , but it has all the spirit that was required ; the toil of the week has ceased , the labourer has returned to his well-ordered home — his “ cozie ingle and his clean hearth-stane , ” — and with his wife and children beside him , turns his thoughts to the praise of that God to whom he owes all : this he performs with a reverence and an awe , at once natural , national , and poetic . “ The Mouse ” is a brief and happy and very moving poem : happy , for it delineates , with wonderful truth and life , the agitation of the mouse when the coulter broke into its abode ; and moving , for the poet takes the lesson of ruin to himself , and feels the present and dreads the future . “ The Mountain Daisy , ” once , more properly , called by Burns “ The Gowan , ” resembles “ The Mouse ” in incident and in moral , and is equally happy , in language and conception . “ The Lament ” is a dark , and all but tragic page , from the poet 's own life . “ Man was made to Mourn ’ ” takes the part of the humble and the homeless , against the coldness and selfishness of the wealthy and the powerful , a favourite topic of meditation with Burns . He refrained , for awhile , from making “ Death and Doctor Hernbook ” public ; a poem which deviates from the offensiveness of personal satire , into a strain of humour , at once airy and original .</p>
   <p>His epistles in verse may be reckoned amongst his happiest productions : they are written in all moods of mind , and are , by turns , lively and sad ; careless and serious ;— now giving advice , then taking it ; laughing at learning , and lamenting its want ; scoffing at propriety and wealth , yet admitting , that without the one he cannot be wise , nor wanting the other , independent . The Epistle to David Sillar is the first of these compositions : the poet has no news to tell , and no serious question to ask : he has only to communicate his own emotions of joy , or of sorrow , and these he relates and discusses with singular elegance as well as ease , twining , at the same time , into the fabric of his composition , agreeable allusions to the taste and affections of his correspondent . He seems to have rated the intellect of Sillar as the highest among his rustic friends : he pays him more deference , and addresses him in a higher vein than he observes to others . The Epistles to Lapraik , to Smith , and to Rankine , are in a more familiar , or social mood , and lift the veil from the darkness of the poet 's condition , and exhibit a mind of first-rate power , groping , and that surely , its way to distinction , in spite of humility of birth , obscurity of condition , and the coldness of the wealthy or the titled . The epistles of other poets owe some of their fame to the rank or the reputation of those to whom they are addressed ; those of Burns are written , one and all , to nameless and undistinguished men . Sillar was a country schoolmaster , Lapraik a moorland laird , Smith a small shop-keeper , and Rankine a farmer , who loved a gill and a joke . Yet these men were the chief friends , the only literary associates of the poet , during those early years , in which , with some exceptions , his finest works were written .</p>
   <p>Burns , while he was writing the poems , the chief of which we have named , was a labouring husbandman on the little farm of Mossgiel , a pursuit which affords but few leisure hours for either reading or pondering ; but to him the stubble-field was musing-ground , and the walk behind the plough , a twilight saunter on Parnassus . As , with a careful hand and a steady eye , he guided his horses , and saw an evenly furrow turned up by the share , his thoughts were on other themes ; he was straying in haunted glens , when spirits have power — looking in fancy on the lasses “ skelping barefoot , ” in silks and in scarlets , to a field-preaching — walking in imagination with the rosy widow , who on Halloween ventured to dip her left sleeve in the burn , where three lairds ’ lands met — making the “ bottle clunk , ” with joyous smugglers , on a lucky run of gin or brandy — or if his thoughts at all approached his acts — he was moralizing on the daisy oppressed by the furrow which his own ploughshare had turned . That his thoughts were thus wandering we have his own testimony , with that of his brother Gilbert ; and were both wanting , the certainty that he composed the greater part of his immortal poems in two years , from the summer of 1784 to the summer of 1786 , would be evidence sufficient . The muse must have been strong within him , when , in spite of the rains and sleets of the “ ever-dropping west ” — when in defiance of the hot and sweaty brows occasioned by reaping and thrashing — declining markets , and showery harvests — the clamour of his laird for his rent , and the tradesman for his account , he persevered in song , and sought solace in verse , when all other solace was denied him .</p>
   <p>The circumstances under which his principal poems were composed , have been related : the “ Lament of Mailie ” found its origin in the catastrophe of a pet ewe ; the “ Epistle to Sillar ” was confided by the poet to his brother while they were engaged in weeding the kale-yard ; the “ Address to the Deil ” was suggested by the many strange portraits which belief or fear had drawn of Satan , and was repeated by the one brother to the other , on the way with their carts to the kiln , for lime ; the “ Cotter 's Saturday Night ” originated in the reverence with which the worship of God was conducted in the family of the poet 's father , and in the solemn tone with which he desired his children to compose themselves for praise and prayer ; “ the Mouse , ” and its moral companion “ the Daisy , ” were the offspring of the incidents which they relate ; and “ Death and Doctor Hornbook ” was conceived at a freemason-meeting , where the hero of the piece had shown too much of the pedant , and composed on his way home , after midnight , by the poet , while his head was somewhat dizzy with drink . One of the most remarkable of his compositions , the “ Jolly Beggars , ” a drama , to which nothing in the language of either the North or South can be compared , and which was unknown till after the death of the author , was suggested by a scene which he saw in a low ale-house , into which , on a Saturday night , most of the sturdy beggars of the district had met to sell their meal , pledge their superfluous rags , and drink their gains . It may be added , that he loved to walk in solitary spots ; that his chief musing-ground was the banks of the Ayr ; the season most congenial to his fancy that of winter , when the winds were heard in the leafless woods , and the voice of the swollen streams came from vale and hill ; and that he seldom composed a whole poem at once , but satisfied with a few fervent verses , laid the subject aside , till the muse summoned him to another exertion of fancy . In a little back closet , still existing in the farm-house of Mossgiel , he committed most of his poems to paper .</p>
   <p>But while the poet rose , the farmer sank . It was not the cold clayey bottom of his ground , nor the purchase of unsound seed-corn , not the fluctuation in the markets alone , which injured him ; neither was it the taste for freemason socialities , nor a desire to join the mirth of comrades , either of the sea or the shore : neither could it be wholly imputed to his passionate following of the softer sex — indulgence in the “ illicit rove , ” or giving way to his eloquence at the feet of one whom he loved and honoured ; other farmers indulged in the one , or suffered from the other , yet were prosperous . His want of success arose from other causes ; his heart was not with his task , save by fits and starts : he felt he was designed for higher purposes than ploughing , and harrowing , and sowing , and reaping : when the sun called on him , after a shower , to come to the plough , or when the ripe corn invited the sickle , or the ready market called for the measured grain , the poet was under other spells , and was slow to avail himself of those golden moments which come but once in the season . To this may be added , a too superficial knowledge of the art of farming , and a want of intimacy with the nature of the soil he was called to cultivate . He could speak fluently of leas , and faughs , and fallows , of change of seed and rotation of crops , but practical knowledge and application were required , and in these Burns was deficient . The moderate gain which those dark days of agriculture brought to the economical farmer , was not obtained : the close , the all but niggardly care by which he could win and keep his crown-piece ,— gold was seldom in the farmer 's hand ,— was either above or below the mind of the poet , and Mossgiel , which , in the hands of an assiduous farmer , might have made a reasonable return for labour , was unproductive , under one who had little skill , less economy , and no taste for the task .</p>
   <p>Other reasons for his failure have been assigned . It is to the credit of the moral sentiments of the husbandmen of Scotland , that when one of their class forgets what virtue requires , and dishonours , without reparation , even the humblest of the maidens , he is not allowed to go unpunished . No proceedings take place , perhaps one hard word is not spoken ; but he is regarded with loathing by the old and the devout ; he is looked on by all with cold and reproachful eyes — sorrow is foretold as his lot , sure disaster as his fortune ; and is these chance to arrive , the only sympathy expressed is , “ What better could he expect ? ” Something of this sort befel Burns : he had already satisfied the kirk in the matter of “ Sonsie , smirking , dear-bought Bess , ” his daughter , by one of his mother 's maids ; and now , to use his own words , he was brought within point-blank of the heaviest metal of the kirk by a similar folly . The fair transgressor , both for her fathers and her own youth , had a large share of public sympathy . Jean Armour , for it is of her I speak , was in her eighteenth year ; with dark eyes , a handsome foot , and a melodious tongue , she made her way to the poet 's heart — and , as their stations in life were equal , it seemed that they had only to be satisfied themselves to render their union easy . But her father , in addition to being a very devout man , was a zealot of the Old Light ; and Jean , dreading his resentment , was willing , while she loved its unforgiven satirist , to love him in secret , in the hope that the time would come when she might safely avow it : she admitted the poet , therefore , to her company in lonesome places , and walks beneath the moon , where they both forgot themselves , and were at last obliged to own a private marriage as a protection from kirk censure . The professors of the Old Light rejoiced , since it brought a scoffing rhymer within reach of their hand ; but her father felt a twofold sorrow , because of the shame of a favourite daughter , and for having committed the folly with one both loose in conduct and profane of speech . He had cause to be angry , but his anger , through his zeal , became tyrannous : in the exercise of what he called a father 's power , he compelled his child to renounce the poet as her husband and burn the marriage-lines ; for he regarded her marriage , without the kirk 's permission , with a man so utterly cast away , as a worse crime than her folly . So blind is anger ! She could renounce neither her husband nor his offspring in a lawful way , and in spite of the destruction of the marriage lines , and renouncing the name of wife , she was as much Mrs. Burns as marriage could make her . No one concerned seemed to think so . Burns , who loved her tenderly , went all but mad when she renounced him : he gave up his share of Mossgiel to his brother , and roamed , moody and idle , about the land , with no better aim in life than a situation in one of our western sugar-isles , and a vague hope of distinction as a poet .</p>
   <p>How the distinction which he desired as a poet was to be obtained , was , to a poor bard in a provincial place , a sore puzzle : there were no enterprising booksellers in the western land , and it was not to be expected that the printers of either Kilmarnock or Paisley had money to expend on a speculation in rhyme : it is much to the honour of his native county that the publication which he wished for was at last made easy . The best of his poems , in his own handwriting , had found their way into the hands of the Ballantynes , Hamiltons , Parkers , and Mackenzies , and were much admired . Mrs. Stewart , of Stair and Afton , a lady of distinction and taste , had made , accidentally , the acquaintance both of Burns and some of his songs , and was ready to befriend him ; and so favourable was the impression on all hands , that a subscription , sufficient to defray the outlay of paper and print , was soon filled up — one hundred copies being subscribed for by the Parkers alone . He soon arranged materials for a volume , and put them into the hands of a printer in Kilmarnock , the Wee Johnnie of one of his biting epigrams . Johnnie was startled at the unceremonious freedom of most of the pieces , and asked the poet to compose one of modest language and moral aim , to stand at the beginning , and excuse some of those free ones which followed : Burns , whose “ Twa Dogs ” was then incomplete , finished the poem at a sitting , and put it in the van , much to his printer 's satisfaction . If the “ Jolly Beggars ” was omitted for any other cause than its freedom of sentiment and language , or “ Death and Doctor Hornbook ” from any other feeling than that of being too personal , the causes of their exclusion have remained a secret . It is less easy to account for the emission of many songs of high merit which he had among his papers : perhaps he thought those which he selected were sufficient to test the taste of the public . Before he printed the whole , he , with the consent of his brother , altered his name from Burness to Burns , a change which , I am told , he in after years regretted .</p>
   <p>In the summer of the year 1786 , the little volume , big with the hopes and fortunes of the bard made its appearance : it was entitled simply , “ Poems , chiefly in the Scottish Dialect ; by Robert Burns ; ” and accompanied by a modest preface , saying , that he submitted his book to his country with fear and with trembling , since it contained little of the art of poesie , and at the best was but a voice given , rude , he feared , and uncouth , to the loves , the hopes , and the fears of his own bosom . Had a summer sun risen on a winter morning , it could not have surprised the Lowlands of Scotland more than this Kilmarnock volume surprised and delighted the people , one and all . The milkmaid sang his songs , the ploughman repeated his poems ; the old quoted both , and ever the devout rejoiced that idle verse had at last mixed a tone of morality with its mirth . The volume penetrated even into Nithsdale . “ Keep it out of the way of your children , ” said a Cameronian divine , when he lent it to my father , “ lest ye find them , as I found mine , reading it on the Sabbath . ” No wonder that such a volume made its way to the hearts of a peasantry whose taste in poetry had been the marvel of many writers : the poems were mostly on topics with which they were familiar : the language was that of the fireside , raised above the vulgarities of common life , by a purifying spirit of expression and the exalting fervour of inspiration : and there was such a brilliant and graceful mixture of the elegant and the homely , the lofty and the low , the familiar and the elevated — such a rapid succession of scenes which moved to tenderness or tears ; or to subdued mirth or open laughter — unlooked for allusions to scripture , or touches of sarcasm and scandal — of superstitions to scare , and of humour to delight — while through the whole was diffused , as the scent of flowers through summer air , a moral meaning — a sentimental beauty , which sweetened and sanctified all . The poet 's expectations from this little venture were humble : he hoped as much money from it as would pay for his passage to the West Indies , where he proposed to enter into the service of some of the Scottish settlers , and help to manage the double mystery of sugar-making and slavery .</p>
   <p>The hearty applause which I have recorded came chiefly from the husbandman , the shepherd , and the mechanic : the approbation of the magnates of the west , though not less-warm , was longer in coming . Mrs. Stewart of Stair , indeed , commended the poems and cheered their author : Dugald Stewart received his visits with pleasure , and wondered at his vigour of conversation as much as at his muse : the door of the house of Hamilton was open to him , where the table was ever spread , and the hand ever ready to help : while the purses of the Ballantynes and the Parkers were always as open to him as were the doors of their houses . Those persons must be regarded as the real patrons of the poet : the high names of the district are not to be found among those who helped him with purse and patronage in 1786 , that year of deep distress and high distinction . The Montgomerys came with their praise when his fame was up ; the Kennedys and the Boswells were silent : and though the Cunninghams gave effectual aid , it was when the muse was crying with a loud voice before him , “ Come all and see the man whom I delight to honour . ” It would be unjust as well as ungenerous not to mention the name of Mrs. Dunlop among the poet 's best and early patrons : the distance at which she lived from Mossgiel had kept his name from her till his poems appeared : but his works induced her to desire his acquaintance , and she became his warmest and surest friend .</p>
   <p>To say the truth , Burns endeavoured in every honourable way to obtain the notice of those who had influence in the land : he copied out the best of his unpublished poems in a fair hand , and inserting them in his printed volume , presented it to those who seemed slow to buy : he rewarded the notice of this one with a song — the attentions of that one with a sally of encomiastic verse : he left psalms of his own composing in the manse when he feasted with a divine : he enclosed “ Holy Willie 's Prayer , ” with an injunction to be grave , to one who loved mirth : he sent the “ Holy Fair ” to one whom he invited to drink a gill out of a mutchkin stoup , at Mauchline market ; and on accidentally meeting with Lord Daer , he immediately commemorated the event in a sally of verse , of a strain more free and yet as flattering as ever flowed from the lips of a court bard . While musing over the names of those on whom fortune had smiled , yet who had neglected to smile on him , he remembered that he had met Miss Alexander , a young beauty of the west , in the walks of Ballochmyle ; and he recorded the impression which this fair vision made on him in a song of unequalled elegance and melody . He had met her in the woods in July , on the 18th of November he sent her the song , and reminded her of the circumstance from which it arose , in a letter which it is evident he had laboured to render polished and complimentary . The young lady took no notice of either the song or the poet , though willing , it is said , to hear of both now :— this seems to have been the last attempt he made on the taste or the sympathies of the gentry of his native district : for on the very day following we find him busy in making arrangements for his departure to Jamaica .</p>
   <p>For this step Burns had more than sufficient reasons : the profits of his volume amounted to little more than enough to waft him across the Atlantic : Wee Johnnie , though the edition was all sold , refused to risk another on speculation : his friends , both Ballantynes and Parkers , volunteered to relieve the printer 's anxieties , but the poet declined their bounty , and gloomily indented himself in a ship about to sail from Greenock , and called on his muse to take farewell of Caledonia , in the last song he ever expected to measure in his native land . That fine lyric , beginning “ The gloomy night is gathering fast , ” was the offspring of these moments of regret and sorrow . His feelings were not expressed in song alone : he remembered his mother and his natural daughter , and made an assignment of all that pertained to him at Mossgiel — and that was but little — and of all the advantage which a cruel , unjust , and insulting law allowed in the proceeds of his poems , for their support and behoof . This document was publicly read in the presence of the poet , at the market-cross of Ayr , by his friend William Chalmers , a notary public . Even this step was to Burns one of danger : some ill-advised person had uncoupled the merciless pack of the law at his heels , and he was obliged to shelter himself as he best could , in woods , it is said , by day and in barns by night , till the final hour of his departure came . That hour arrived , and his chest was on the way to the ship , when a letter was put into his hand which seemed to light him to brighter prospects .</p>
   <p>Among the friends whom his merits had procured him was Dr. Laurie , a district clergyman , who had taste enough to admire the deep sensibilities as well as the humour of the poet , and the generosity to make known both his works and his worth to the warm-hearted and amiable Blacklock , who boldly proclaimed him a poet of the first rank , and lamented that he was not in Edinburgh to publish another edition of his poems . Burns was ever a man of impulse : he recalled his chest from Greenock ; he relinquished the situation he had accepted on the estate of one Douglas ; took a secret leave of his mother , and , without an introduction to any one , and unknown personally to all , save to Dugald Stewart , away he walked , through Glenap , to Edinburgh , full of new hope and confiding in his genius . When he arrived , he scarcely knew what to do : he hesitated to call on the professor ; he refrained from making himself known , as it has been supposed he did , to the enthusiastic Blacklock ; but , sitting down in an obscure lodging , he sought out an obscure printer , recommended by a humble comrade from Kyle , and began to negotiate for a new edition of the Poems of the Ayrshire Ploughman . This was not the way to go about it : his barge had well nigh been shipwrecked in the launch ; and he might have lived to regret the letter which hindered his voyage to Jamaica , had he not met by chance in the street a gentleman of the west , of the name of Dalzell , who introduced him to the Earl of Glencairn , a nobleman whose classic education did not hurt his taste for Scottish poetry , and who was not too proud to lend his helping hand to a rustic stranger of such merit as Burns . Cunningham carried him to Creech , then the Murray of Edinburgh , a shrewd man of business , who opened the poet 's eyes to his true interests : the first proposals , then all but issued , were put in the fire , and new ones printed and diffused over the island . The subscription was headed by half the noblemen of the north : the Caledonian Hunt , through the interest of Glencairn , took six hundred copies : duchesses and countesses swelled the list , and such a crowding to write down names had not been witnessed since the signing of the solemn league and covenant .</p>
   <p>While the subscription-papers were filling and the new volume printing on a paper and in a type worthy of such high patronage , Burns remained in Edinburgh , where , for the winter season , he was a lion , and one of an unwonted kind . Philosophers , historians , and scholars had shaken the elegant coteries of the city with their wit , or enlightened them with their learning , but they were all men who had been polished by polite letters or by intercourse with high life , and there was a sameness in their very dress as well as address , of which peers and peeresses had become weary . They therefore welcomed this rustic candidate for the honour of giving wings to their hours of lassitude and weariness , with a welcome more than common ; and when his approach was announced , the polished circle looked for the advent of a lout from the plough , in whose uncouth manners and embarrassed address they might find matter both for mirth and wonder . But they met with a barbarian who was not at all barbarous : as the poet met in Lord Daer feelings and sentiments as natural as those of a ploughman , so they met in a ploughman manners worthy of a lord : his air was easy and unperplexed : his address was perfectly well-bred , and elegant in its simplicity : he felt neither eclipsed by the titled nor struck dumb before the learned and the eloquent , but took his station with the ease and grace of one born to it . In the society of men alone he spoke out : he spared neither his wit , his humour , nor his sarcasm — he seemed to say to all — “ I am a man , and you are no more ; and why should I not act and speak like one ? ” — it was remarked , however , that he had not learnt , or did not desire , to conceal his emotions — that he commended with more rapture than was courteous , and contradicted with more bluntness than was accounted polite . It was thus with him in the company of men : when woman approached , his look altered , his eye beamed milder ; all that was stern in his nature underwent a change , and he received them with deference , but with a consciousness that he could win their attention as he had won that of others , who differed , indeed , from them only in the texture of their kirtles . This natural power of rendering himself acceptable to women had been observed and envied by Sillar , one of the dearest of his early comrades ; and it stood him in good stead now , when he was the object to whom the Duchess of Gordon , the loveliest as well as the wittiest of women — directed her discourse . Burns , she afterwards said , won the attention of the Edinburgh ladies by a deferential way of address — by an ease and natural grace of manners , as new as it was unexpected — that he told them the stories of some of his tenderest songs or liveliest poems in a style quite magical — enriching his little narratives , which had one and all the merit of being short , with personal incidents of humour or of pathos .</p>
   <p>In a party , when Dr. Blair and Professor Walker were present , Burns related the circumstances under which he had composed his melancholy song , “ The gloomy night is gathering fast , ” in a way even more touching than the verses : and in the company of the ruling beauties of the time , he hesitated not to lift the veil from some of the tenderer parts of his own history , and give them glimpses of the romance of rustic life . A lady of birth — one of his must willing listeners — used , I am told , to say , that she should never forget the tale which he related of his affection for Mary Campbell , his Highland Mary , as he loved to call her . She was fair , he said , and affectionate , and as guileless as she was beautiful ; and beautiful he thought her in a very high degree . The first time he saw her was during one of his musing walks in the woods of Montgomery Castle ; and the first time he spoke to her was during the merriment of a harvest-kirn . There were others there who admired her , but he addressed her , and had the luck to win her regard from them all . He soon found that she was the lass whom he had long sought , but never before found — that her good looks were surpassed by her good sense ; and her good sense was equalled by her discretion and modesty . He met her frequently : she saw by his looks that he was sincere ; she put full trust in his love , and used to wander with him among the green knowes and stream-banks till the sun went down and the moon rose , talking , dreaming of love and the golden days which awaited them . He was poor , and she had only her half-year 's fee , for she was in the condition of a servant ; but thoughts of gear never darkened their dream : they resolved to wed , and exchanged vows of constancy and love . They plighted their vows on the Sabbath to render them more sacred — they made them by a burn , where they had courted , that open nature might be a witness — they made them over an open Bible , to show that they thought of God in this mutual act — and when they had done they both took water in their hands , and scattered it in the air , to intimate that as the stream was pure so were their intentions . They parted when they did this , but they parted never to meet more : she died in a burning fever , during a visit to her relations to prepare for her marriage ; and all that he had of her was a lock of her long bright hair , and her Bible , which she exchanged for his .</p>
   <p>Even with the tales which he related of rustic love and adventure his own story mingled ; and ladies of rank heard , for the first time , that in all that was romantic in the passion of love , and in all that was chivalrous in sentiment , men of distinction , both by education and birth , were at least equalled by the peasantry of the land . They listened with interest , and inclined their feathers beside the bard , to hear how love went on in the west , and in no case it ran quite smooth . Sometimes young hearts were kept asunder by the sordid feelings of parents , who could not be persuaded to bestow their daughter , perhaps an only one , on a wooer who could not count penny for penny , and number cow for cow : sometimes a mother desired her daughter to look higher than to one of her station : for her beauty and her education entitled her to match among the lairds , rather than the tenants ; and sometimes , the devotional tastes of both father and mother , approving of personal looks and connexions , were averse to see a daughter bestow her hand on one , whose language in religion was indiscreet , and whose morals were suspected . Yet , neither the vigilance of fathers , nor the suspicious care of aunts and mothers , could succeed in keeping those asunder whose hearts were together ; but in these meetings circumspection and invention were necessary : all fears were to be lulled by the seeming carelessness of the lass ,— all perils were to be met and braved by the spirit of the lad . His home , perhaps , was at a distance , and he had wild woods to come through , and deep streams to pass , before he could see the signal-light , now shown and now withdrawn , at her window ; he had to approach with a quick eye and a wary foot , lest a father or a brother should see , and deter him : he had sometimes to wish for a cloud upon the moon , whose light , welcome to him on his way in the distance , was likely to betray him when near ; and he not unfrequently reckoned a wild night of wind and rain as a blessing , since it helped to conceal his coming , and proved to his mistress that he was ready to brave all for her sake . Of rivals met and baffled ; of half-willing and half-unconsenting maidens , persuaded and won ; of the light-hearted and the careless becoming affectionate and tender ; and the coy , the proud , and the satiric being gained by “ persuasive words , and more persuasive sighs , ” as dames had been gained of old , he had tales enow . The ladies listened , and smiled at the tender narratives of the poet .</p>
   <p>Of his appearance among the sons as well as the daughters of men , we have the account of Dugald Stewart . “ Burns , ” says the philosopher , “ came to Edinburgh early in the winter : the attentions which he received from all ranks and descriptions of persons , were such as would have turned any head but his own . He retained the same simplicity of manners and appearance which had struck me so forcibly when I first saw him in the country : his dress was suited to his station ; plain and unpretending , with sufficient attention to neatness : he always wore boots , and , when on more than usual ceremony , buckskin breeches . His manners were manly , simple , and independent ; strongly expressive of conscious genius and worth , but without any indication of forwardness , arrogance , or vanity . He took his share in conversation , but not more than belonged to him , and listened with apparent deference on subjects where his want of education deprived him of the means of information . If there had been a little more of gentleness and accommodation in his temper , he would have been still more interesting ; but he had been accustomed to give law in the circle of his ordinary acquaintance , and his dread of anything approaching to meanness or servility , rendered his manner somewhat decided and hard . Nothing perhaps was more remarkable among his various attainments , than the fluency and precision and originality of language , when he spoke in company ; more particularly as he aimed at purity in his turn of expression , and avoided more successfully than most Scotsmen , the peculiarities of Scottish phraseology . From his conversation I should have pronounced him to have been fitted to excel in whatever walk of ambition he had chosen to exert his abilities . He was passionately fond of the beauties of nature , and I recollect he once told me , when I was admiring a distant prospect in one of our morning walks , that the sight of so many smoking cottages gave a pleasure to his mind , which none could understand who had not witnessed , like himself , the happiness and worth which cottages contained . ”</p>
   <p>Such was the impression which Burns made at first on the fair , the titled , and the learned of Edinburgh ; an impression which , though lessened by intimacy and closer examination on the part of the men , remained unimpaired , on that of the softer sex , till his dying-day . His company , during the season of balls and festivities , continued to be courted by all who desired to be reckoned gay or polite . Cards of invitation fell thick on him ; he was not more welcome to the plumed and jewelled groups , whom her fascinating Grace of Gordon gathered about her , than he was to the grave divines and polished scholars , who assembled in the rooms of Stewart , or Blair , or Robertson . The classic socialities of Tytler , afterwards Lord Woodhouslee , or the elaborate supper-tables of the whimsical Monboddo , whose guests imagined they were entertained in the manner of Lucullus or of Cicero , were not complete without the presence of the ploughman of Kyle ; and the feelings of the rustic poet , facing such companies , though of surprise and delight at first , gradually subsided , he said , as he discerned , that man differed from man only in the polish , and not in the grain . But Edinburgh offered tables and entertainers of a less orderly and staid character than those I have named — where the glass circulated with greater rapidity ; where the wit flowed more freely ; and where there were neither highbred ladies to charm conversation within the bounds of modesty , nor serious philosophers , nor grave divines , to set a limit to the license of speech , or the hours of enjoyment . To these companions — and these were all of the better classes , the levities of the rustic poet 's wit and humour were as welcome us were the tenderest of his narratives to the accomplished Duchess of Gordon and the beautiful Miss Burnet of Monboddo ; they raised a social roar not at all classic , and demanded and provoked his sallies of wild humour , or indecorous mirth , with as much delight as he had witnessed among the lads of Kyle , when , at mill or forge , his humorous sallies abounded as the ale flowed . In these enjoyments the rough , but learned William Nicol , and the young and amiable Robert Ainslie shared : the name of the poet was coupled with those of profane wits , free livers , and that class of half-idle gentlemen who hang about the courts of law , or for a season or two wear the livery of Mars , and handle cold iron .</p>
   <p>Edinburgh had still another class of genteel convivialists , to whom the poet was attracted by principles as well as by pleasure ; these were the relics of that once numerous body , the Jacobites , who still loved to cherish the feelings of birth or education rather than of judgment , and toasted the name of Stuart , when the last of the race had renounced his pretensions to a throne , for the sake of peace and the cross . Young men then , and high names were among them , annually met on the pretender 's birth-day , and sang songs in which the white rose of Jacobitism flourished ; toasted toasts announcing adherence to the male line of the Bruce and the Stuart , and listened to the strains of the laureate of the day , who prophesied , in drink , the dismissal of the intrusive Hanoverian , by the right and might of the righteous and disinherited line . Burns , who was descended from a northern race , whoso father was suspected of having drawn the claymore in 1745 , and who loved the blood of the Keith-Marishalls , under whose banners his ancestors had marched , readily united himself to a band in whose sentiments , political and social , he was a sharer . He was received with acclamation : the dignity of laureate was conferred upon him , and his inauguration ode , in which he recalled the names and the deeds of the Grahams , the Erskines , the Boyds , and the Gordons , was applauded for its fire , as well as for its sentiments . Yet , though he ate and drank and sang with Jacobites , he was only as far as sympathy and poesie went , of their number : his reason renounced the principles and the religion of the Stuart line ; and though he shed a tear over their fallen fortunes — though he sympathized with the brave and honourable names that perished in their cause — though he cursed “ the butcher , Cumberland , ” and the bloody spirit which commanded the heads of the good and the heroic to be stuck where they would affright the passer-by , and pollute the air — he had no desire to see the splendid fabric of constitutional freedom , which the united genius of all parties had raised , thrown wantonly down . His Jacobitism influenced , not his head , but his heart , and gave a mournful hue to many of his lyric compositions .</p>
   <p>Meanwhile his poems were passing through the press . Burns made a few emendations of those published in the Kilmarnock edition , and he added others which , as he expressed it , he had carded and spun , since he passed Glenbuck . Some rather coarse lines were softened or omitted in the “ Twa Dogs ; ” others , from a change of his personal feelings , were made in the “ Vision : ” “ Death and Doctor Hornbook , ” excluded before , was admitted now : the “ Dream ” was retained , in spite of the remonstrances of Mrs. Stewart , of Stair , and Mrs. Dunlop ; and the “ Brigs of Ayr , ” in compliment to his patrons in his native district , and the “ Address to Edinburgh , ” in honour of his titled and distinguished friends in that metropolis , were printed for the first time . He was unwilling to alter what he had once printed : his friends , classic , titled , and rustic , found him stubborn and unpliable , in matters of criticism ; yet he was generally of a complimental mood : he loaded the robe of Coila in the “ Vision , ” with more scenes than it could well contain , that he might include in the landscape , all the country-seats of his friends , and he gave more than their share of commendation to the Wallaces , out of respect to his friend Mrs. Dunlop . Of the critics of Edinburgh he said , they spun the thread of their criticisms so fine that it was unfit for either warp or weft ; and of its scholars , he said , they were never satisfied with any Scottish poet , unless they could trace him in Horace . One morning at Dr. Blair 's breakfast-table , when the “ Holy Fair ” was the subject of conversation , the reverend critic said , “ Why should</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ — Moody speel the holy door</l>
     <l n="2">With tidings of salvation ? ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>if you had said , with tidings of damnation , the satire would have been the better and the bitterer . ” “ Excellent ! ” exclaimed the poet , “ the alteration is capital , and I hope you will honour me by allowing me to say in a note at whose suggestion it was made . ” Professor Walker , who tells the anecdote , adds that Blair evaded , with equal good humour and decision , this not very polite request ; nor was this the only slip which the poet made on this occasion : some one asked him in which of the churches of Edinburgh he had received the highest gratification : he named the High-church , but gave the preference over all preachers to Robert Walker , the colleague and rival in eloquence of Dr. Blair himself , and that in a tone so pointed and decisive as to make all at the table stare and look embarrassed . The poet confessed afterwards that he never reflected on his blunder without pain and mortification . Blair probably had this in his mind , when , on reading the poem beginning “ When Guildford good our pilot stood , ” he exclaimed , “ Ah ! the politics of Burns always smell of the smithy , ” meaning , that they were vulgar and common .</p>
   <p>In April , the second or Edinburgh , edition was published : it was widely purchased , and as warmly commended . The country had been prepared for it by the generous and discriminating criticisms of Henry Mackenzie , published in that popular periodical , “ The Lounger , ” where he says , “ Burns possesses the spirit as well as the fancy of a poet ; that honest pride and independence of soul , which are sometimes the muse 's only dower , break forth on every occasion , in his works . ” The praise of the author of the “ Man of Feeling ” was not more felt by Burns , than it was by the whole island : the harp of the north had not been swept for centuries by a hand so forcible , and at the same time so varied , that it awakened every tone , whether of joy or woe : the language was that of rustic life ; the scenes of the poems were the dusty barn , the clay-floored reeky cottage , and the furrowed field ; and the characters were cowherds , ploughmen , and mechanics . The volume was embellished by a head of the poet from the hand of the now venerable Alexander Nasmith ; and introduced by a dedication to the noblemen and gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt , in a style of vehement independence , unknown hitherto in the history of subscriptions . The whole work , verse , prose , and portrait , won public attention , and kept it : and though some critics signified their displeasure at expressions which bordered on profanity , and at a license of language which they pronounced impure , by far the greater number united their praise to the all but general voice ; nay , some scrupled not to call him , from his perfect ease and nature and variety , the Scottish Shakspeare . No one rejoiced more in his success and his fame , than the matron of Mossgiel .</p>
   <p>Other matters than his poems and socialities claimed the attention of Burns in Edinburgh . He had a hearty relish for the joyous genius of Allan Ramsay ; he traced out his residences , and rejoiced to think that while he stood in the shop of his own bookseller , Creech , the same floor had been trod by the feet of his great forerunner . He visited , too , the lowly grave of the unfortunate Robert Fergusson ; and it must be recorded to the shame of the magistrates of Edinburgh , that they allowed him to erect a headstone to his memory , and to the scandal of Scotland , that in such a memorial he had not been anticipated . He seems not to have regarded the graves of scholars or philosophers ; and he trod the pavements where the warlike princes and nobles had walked without any emotion . He loved , however , to see places celebrated in Scottish song , and fields where battles for the independence of his country had been stricken ; and , with money in his pocket which his poems had produced , and with a letter from a witty but weak man , Lord Buchan , instructing him to pull birks on the Yarrow , broom on the Cowden-knowes , and not to neglect to admire the ruins of Drybrugh Abbey , Burns set out on a border tour , accompanied by Robert Ainslie , of Berrywell . As the poet had talked of returning to the plough , Dr. Blair imagined that he was on his way back to the furrowed field , and wrote him a handsome farewell , saying he was leaving Edinburgh with a character which had survived many temptations ; with a name which would be placed with the Ramsays and the Fergussons , and with the hopes of all , that , in a second volume , on which his fate as a poet would very much depend , he might rise yet higher in merit and in fame . Burns , who received this communication when laying his leg over the saddle to be gone , is said to have muttered , “ Ay , but a man 's first book is sometimes like his first babe , healthier and stronger than those which follow . ”</p>
   <p>On the 6th of May , 1787 , Burns reached Berrywell : he recorded of the laird , that he was clear-headed , and of Miss Ainslie , that she was amiable and handsome — of Dudgeon , the author of “ The Maid that tends the Goats , ” that he had penetration and modesty , and of the preacher , Bowmaker , that he was a man of strong lungs and vigorous remark . On crossing the Tweed at Coldstream he took off his hat , and kneeling down , repeated aloud the two last verses of the “ Cotter 's Saturday Night : ” on returning , he drunk tea with Brydone , the traveller , a man , he said , kind and benevolent : he cursed one Cole as an English Hottentot , for having rooted out an ancient garden belonging to a Romish ruin ; and he wrote of Macdowal , of Caverton-mill , that by his skill in rearing sheep , he sold his flocks , ewe and lamb , for a couple of guineas each : that he washed his sheep before shearing — and by his turnips improved sheep-husbandry ; he added , that lands were generally let at sixteen shillings the Scottish acre ; the farmers rich , and , compared to Ayrshire , their houses magnificent . On his way to Jedburgh he visited an old gentleman in whose house was an arm-chair , once the property of the author of “ The Seasons ; ” he reverently examined the relic , and could scarcely be persuaded to sit in it : he was a warm admirer of Thomson .</p>
   <p>In Jedburgh , Burns found much to interest him : the ruins of a splendid cathedral , and of a strong castle — and , what was still more attractive , an amiable young lady , very handsome , with “ beautiful hazel eyes , full of spirit , sparkling with delicious moisture , ” and looks which betokened a high order of female mind . He gave her his portrait , and entered this remembrance of her attractions among his memoranda :— “ My heart is thawed into melting pleasure , after being so long frozen up in the Greenland bay of indifference , amid the noise and nonsense of Edinburgh . I am afraid my bosom has nearly as much tinder as ever . Jed , pure be thy streams , and hallowed thy sylvan banks : sweet Isabella Lindsay , may peace dwell in thy bosom uninterrupted , except by the tumultuous throbbings of rapturous love ! ” With the freedom of Jedburgh , handsomely bestowed by the magistrates , in his pocket , Burns made his way to Wauchope , the residence of Mrs. Scott , who had welcomed him into the world as a poet in verses lively and graceful : he found her , he said , “ a lady of sense and taste , and of a decision peculiar to female authors . ” After dining with Sir Alexander Don , who , he said , was a clever man , but far from a match for his divine lady , a sister of his patron Glencairn , he spent an hour among the beautiful ruins of Dryburgh Abbey ; glanced on the splendid remains of Melrose ; passed , unconscious of the future , over that ground on which have arisen the romantic towers of Abbotsford ; dined with certain of the Souters of Selkirk ; and visited the old keep of Thomas the Rhymer , and a dozen of the hills and streams celebrated in song . Nor did he fail to pay his respects , after returning through Dunse , to Sir James Hall , of Dunglass , and his lady , and was much pleased with the scenery of their romantic place . He was now joined by a gentleman of the name of Kerr , and crossing the Tweed a second time , penetrated into England , as far as the ancient town of Newcastle , where he smiled at a facetious Northumbrian , who at dinner caused the beef to be eaten before the broth was served , in obedience to an ancient injunction , lest the hungry Scotch should come and snatch it . On his way back he saw , what proved to be prophetic of his own fortune — the roup of an unfortunate farmer 's stock : he took out his journal , and wrote with a troubled brow , “ Rigid economy , and decent industry , do you preserve me from being the principal dramatis personæ , in such a scene of horror . ” He extended his tour to Carlisle , and from thence to the banks of the Nith , where he looked at the farm of Ellisland , with the intention of trying once more his fortune at the plough , should poetry and patronage fail him .</p>
   <p>On his way through the West , Burns spent a few days with his mother at Mossgiel : he had left her an unknown and an almost banished man : he returned in fame and in sunshine , admired by all who aspired to be thought tasteful or refined . He felt offended alike with the patrician stateliness of Edinburgh and the plebeian servility of the husbandmen of Ayrshire ; and dreading the influence of the unlucky star which had hitherto ruled his lot , he bought a pocket Milton , he said , for the purpose of studying the intrepid independence and daring magnanimity , and noble defiance of hardships , exhibited by Satan ! In this mood he reached Edinburgh — only to leave it again on three hurried excursions into the Highlands . The route which he took and the sentiments which the scenes awakened , are but faintly intimated in the memoranda which he made . His first journey seems to have been performed in ill-humour ; at Stirling , his Jacobitism , provoked at seeing the ruined palace of the Stuarts , broke out in some unloyal lines which he had the indiscretion to write with a diamond on the window of a public inn . At Carron , where he was refused a sight of the magnificent foundry , he avenged himself in epigram . At Inverary he resented some real or imaginary neglect on the part of his Grace of Argyll , by a stinging lampoon ; nor can he be said to have fairly regained his serenity of temper , till he danced his wrath away with some Highland ladies at Dumbarton .</p>
   <p>His second excursion was made in the company of Dr. Adair , of Harrowgate : the reluctant doors of Carron foundry were opened to him , and he expressed his wonder at the blazing furnaces and broiling labours of the place ; he removed the disloyal lines from the window of the inn at Stirling , and he paid a two days ’ visit to Ramsay of Ochtertyre , a distinguished scholar , and discussed with him future topics for the muse . “ I have been in the company of many men of genius , ” said Ramsay afterwards to Currie , “ some of them poets , but never witnessed such flashes of intellectual brightness as from him — the impulse of the moment , sparks of celestial fire . ” From the Forth he went to the Devon , in the county of Clackmannan , where , for the first time , he saw the beautiful Charlotte Hamilton , the sister of his friend Gavin Hamilton , of Mauchline . “ She is not only beautiful , ” he thus writes to her brother , “ but lovely : her form is elegant , her features not regular , but they have the smile of sweetness , and the settled complacency of good nature in the highest degree . Her eyes are fascinating ; at once expressive of good sense , tenderness and a noble mind . After the exercise of our riding to the Falls , Charlotte was exactly Dr. Donne 's mistress :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Her pure and eloquent blood</l>
     <l n="2">Spoke in her cheeks , and so distinctly wrought ,</l>
     <l n="3">That one would almost say her body thought . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Accompanied by this charming dame , he visited an old lady , Mrs. Bruce , of Clackmannan , who , in the belief that she had the blood of the royal Bruce in her veins , received the poet with something of princely state , and , half in jest , conferred the honour of knighthood upon him , with her ancestor 's sword , saying , in true Jacobitical mood , that she had a better right to do that than some folk had ! In the same pleasing company he visited the famous cataract on the Devon , called the Cauldron Lian , and the Rumbling bridge , a single arch thrown , it is said by the devil , over the Devon , at the height of a hundred feet in the air . It was the complaint of his companions that Burns exhibited no raptures , and poured out no unpremeditated verses at such magnificent scenes . But he did not like to be tutored or prompted : “ Look , look ! ” exclaimed some one , as Carron foundry belched forth flames — “ look , Burns , look ! good heavens , what a grand sight !— look ! ” “ I would not look — look , sir , at your bidding , ” said the bard , turning away , “ were it into the mouth of hell ! ” When he visited , at a future time , the romantic Linn of Creehope , in Nithsdale , he looked silently at its wonders , and showed none of the hoped-for rapture . “ You do not admire it , I fear , ” said a gentleman who accompanied him ; “ I could not admire it more , sir , ” replied Burns , “ if He who made it were to desire me to do it . ” There are other reasons for the silence of Burns amid the scenes of the Devon : he was charmed into love by the sense and the beauty of Charlotte Hamilton , and rendered her homage in that sweet song , “ The Banks of the Devon , ” and in a dozen letters written with more than his usual care , elegance , and tenderness . But the lady was neither to be won by verse nor by prose : she afterwards gave her hand to Adair , the poet 's companion , and , what was less meritorious , threw his letters into the fire .</p>
   <p>The third and last tour into the North was in company of Nicol of the High-School of Edinburgh : on the fields of Bannockburn and Falkirk — places of triumph and of woe to Scotland , he gave way to patriotic impulses , and in these words he recorded them :— “ Stirling , August 20 , 1787 : this morning I knelt at the tomb of Sir John the Graham , the gallant friend of the immortal Wallace ; and two hours ago I said a fervent prayer for old Caledonia , over the hole in a whinstone where Robert the Bruce fixed his royal standard on the banks of Bannockburn . ” He then proceeded northward by Ochtertyre , the water of Earn , the vale of Glen Almond , and the traditionary grave of Ossian . He looked in at princely Taymouth ; mused an hour or two among the Birks of Aberfeldy ; gazed from Birnam top ; paused amid the wild grandeur of the pass of Killiecrankie , at the stone which marks the spot where a second patriot Graham fell , and spent a day at Blair , where he experienced the graceful kindness of the Duke of Athol , and in a strain truly elegant , petitioned him , in the name of Bruar Water , to hide the utter nakedness of its otherwise picturesque banks , with plantations of birch and oak . Quitting Blair he followed the course of the Spey , and passing , as he told his brother , through a wild country , among cliffs gray with eternal snows , and glens gloomy and savage , reached Findhorn in mist and darkness ; visited Castle Cawdor , where Macbeth murdered Duncan ; hastened through Inverness to Urquhart Castle , and the Falls of Fyers , and turned southward to Kilravock , over the fatal moor of Culloden . He admired the ladies of that classic region for their snooded ringlets , simple elegance of dress , and expressive eyes : in Mrs. Rose , of Kilravock Castle , he found that matronly grace and dignity which he owned he loved ; and in the Duke and Duchess of Gordon a renewal of that more than kindness with which they had welcomed him in Edinburgh . But while he admired the palace of Fochabers , and was charmed by the condescensions of the noble proprietors , he forgot that he had left a companion at the inn , too proud and captious to be pleased at favours showered on others : he hastened back to the inn with an invitation and an apology : he found the fiery pedant in a foaming rage , striding up and down the street , cursing in Scotch and Latin the loitering postilions for not yoking the horses , and hurrying him away . All apology and explanation was in vain , and Burns , with a vexation which he sought not to conceal , took his seat silently beside the irascible pedagogue , and returned to the South by Broughty Castle , the banks of Endermay and Queensferry . He parted with the Highlands in a kindly mood , and loved to recal the scenes and the people , both in conversation and in song .</p>
   <p>On his return to Edinburgh he had to bide the time of his bookseller and the public : the impression of his poems , extending to two thousand eight hundred copies , was sold widely : much of the money had to come from a distance , and Burns lingered about the northern metropolis , expecting a settlement with Creech , and with the hope that those who dispensed his country 's patronage might remember one who then , as now , was reckoned an ornament to the land . But Creech , a parsimonious man , was slow in his payments ; the patronage of the country was swallowed up in the sink of politics , and though noblemen smiled , and ladies of rank nodded their jewelled heads in approbation of every new song he sung and every witty sally he uttered , they reckoned any further notice or care superfluous : the poet , an observant man , saw all this ; but hope was the cordial of his heart , he said , and he hoped and lingered on . Too active a genius to remain idle , he addressed himself to the twofold business of love and verse . Repulsed by the stately Beauty of the Devon , he sought consolation in the society of one , as fair , and infinitely more witty ; and as an accident had for a time deprived him of the use of one of his legs , he gave wings to hours of pain , by writing a series of letters to this Edinburgh enchantress , in which he signed himself Sylvander , and addressed her under the name of Clarinda . In these compositions , which no one can regard as serious , and which James Grahame the poet called “ a romance of real Platonic affection , ” amid much affectation both of language and sentiment , and a desire to say fine and startling things , we can see the proud heart of the poet throbbing in the dread of being neglected or forgotten by his country . The love which he offers up at the altar of wit and beauty , seems assumed and put on , for its rapture is artificial , and its brilliancy that of an icicle : no woman was ever wooed and won in that Malvolio way ; and there is no doubt that Mrs. M'Lehose felt as much offence as pleasure at this boisterous display of regard . In aftertimes he loved to remember her :— when wine circulated , Mrs. Mac was his favourite toast .</p>
   <p>During this season he began his lyric contributions to the Musical Museum of Johnson , a work which , amid many imperfections of taste and arrangement , contains more of the true old music and genuine old songs of Scotland , than any other collection with which I am acquainted . Burns gathered oral airs , and fitted them with words of mirth or of woe , of tenderness or of humour , with unexampled readiness and felicity ; he eked out old fragments and sobered down licentious strains so much in the olden spirit and feeling , that the new cannot be distinguished from the ancient ; nay , he inserted lines and half lines , with such skill and nicety , that antiquarians are perplexed to settle which is genuine or which is simulated . Yet with all this he abated not of the natural mirth or the racy humour of the lyric muse of Scotland : he did not like her the less because she walked like some of the maidens of her strains , high-kilted at times , and spoke with the freedom of innocence . In these communications we observe how little his border-jaunt among the fountains of ancient song contributed either of sentiment or allusion , to his lyrics ; and how deeply his strains , whether of pity or of merriment , were coloured by what he had seen , and heard , and felt in the Highlands . In truth , all that lay beyond the Forth was an undiscovered land to him ; while the lowland districts were not only familiar to his mind and eye , but all their more romantic vales and hills and streams were already musical in songs of such excellence as induced him to dread failure rather than hope triumph . Moreover , the Highlands teemed with jacobitical feelings , and scenes hallowed by the blood or the sufferings of men heroic , and perhaps misguided ; and the poet , willingly yielding to an impulse which was truly romantic , and believed by thousands to be loyal , penned his songs on Drumossie , and Killiecrankie , as the spirit of sorrow or of bitterness prevailed . Though accompanied , during his northern excursions , by friends whose socialities and conversation forbade deep thought , or even serious remark , it will be seen by those who read his lyrics with care , that his wreath is indebted for some of its fairest flowers to the Highlands .</p>
   <p>The second winter of the poet 's abode in Edinburgh had now arrived : it opened , as might have been expected , with less rapturous welcomes and with more of frosty civility than the first . It must be confessed , that indulgence in prolonged socialities , and in company which , though clever , could not be called select , contributed to this ; nor must it be forgotten that his love for the sweeter part of creation was now and then carried beyond the limits of poetic respect , and the delicacies of courtesy ; tending to estrange the austere and to lessen the admiration at first common to all . Other causes may be assigned for this wane of popularity : he took no care to conceal his contempt for all who depended on mere scholarship for eminence , and he had a perilous knack in sketching with a sarcastic hand the characters of the learned and the grave . Some indeed of the high literati of the north — Home , the author of Douglas , was one of them — spoke of the poet as a chance or an accident : and though they admitted that he was a poet , yet he was not one of settled grandeur of soul , brightened by study . Burns was probably aware of this ; he takes occasion in some of his letters to suggest , that the hour may be at hand when he shall be accounted by scholars as a meteor , rather than a fixed light , and to suspect that the praise bestowed on his genius was partly owing to the humility of his condition . From his lingering so long about Edinburgh , the nobility began to dread a second volume by subscription , the learned to regard him as a fierce Theban , who resolved to carry all the outworks to the temple of Fame without the labour of making regular approaches ; while a third party , and not the least numerous , looked on him with distrust , as one who hovered between Jacobite and Jacobin ; who disliked the loyal-minded , and loved to lampoon the reigning family . Besides , the marvel of the inspired ploughman had begun to subside ; the bright gloss of novelty was worn off , and his fault lay in his unwillingness to see that he had made all the sport which the Philistines expected , and was required to make room for some “ salvage ” of the season , to paw , and roar , and shake the mane . The doors of the titled , which at first opened spontaneous , like those in Milton 's heaven , were now unclosed for him with a tardy courtesy : he was received with measured stateliness , and seldom requested to repeat his visit . Of this changed aspect of things he complained to a friend : but his real sorrows were mixed with those of the fancy :— he told Mrs. Dunlop with what pangs of heart he was compelled to take shelter in a corner , lest the rattling equipage of some gaping blockhead should mangle him in the mire . In this land of titles and wealth such querulous sensibilities must have been frequently offended .</p>
   <p>Burns , who had talked lightly hitherto of resuming the plough , began now to think seriously about it , for he saw it must come to that at last . Miller , of Dalswinton , a gentleman of scientific acquirements , and who has the merit of applying the impulse of steam to navigation , had offered the poet the choice of his farms , on a fair estate which he had purchased on the Nith : aided by a westland farmer , he selected Ellisland , a beautiful spot , fit alike for the steps of ploughman or poet . On intimating this to the magnates of Edinburgh , no one lamented that a genius so bright and original should be driven to win his bread with the sweat of his brow : no one , with an indignant eye , ventured to tell those to whom the patronage of this magnificent empire was confided , that they were misusing the sacred trust , and that posterity would curse them for their coldness or neglect : neither did any of the rich nobles , whose tables he had adorned by his wit , offer to enable him to toil free of rent , in a land of which he was to be a permanent ornament ;— all were silent — all were cold — the Earl of Glencairn alone , aided by Alexander Wood , a gentleman who merits praise oftener than he is named , did the little that was done or attempted to be done for him : nor was that little done on the peer 's part without solicitation :— “ I wish to go into the excise ; ” thus he wrote to Glencairn ; “ and I am told your lordship 's interest will easily procure me the grant from the commissioners : and your lordship 's patronage and goodness , which have already rescued me from obscurity , wretchedness , and exile , emboldens me to ask that interest . You have likewise put it in my power to save the little tie of home that sheltered an aged mother , two brothers , and three sisters from destruction . I am ill qualified to dog the heels of greatness with the impertinence of solicitation , and tremble nearly as much at the thought of the cold promise as the cold denial . ” The farm and the excise exhibit the poet 's humble scheme of life : the money of the one , he thought , would support the toil of the other , and in the fortunate management of both , he looked for the rough abundance , if not the elegancies suitable to a poet 's condition .</p>
   <p>While Scotland was disgraced by sordidly allowing her brightest genius to descend to the plough and the excise , the poet hastened his departure from a city which had witnessed both his triumph and his shame : he bade farewell in a few well-chosen words to such of the classic literati — the Blairs , the Stewarts , the Mackenzies , and the Tytlers — as had welcomed the rustic bard and continued to countenance him ; while in softer accents he bade adieu to the Clarindas and Chlorises of whose charms he had sung , and , having wrung a settlement from Creech , he turned his steps towards Mossgiel and Mauchline . He had several reasons , and all serious ones , for taking Ayrshire in his way to the Nith : he desired to see his mother , his brothers and sisters , who had partaken of his success , and were now raised from pining penury to comparative affluence : he desired to see those who had aided him in his early struggles into the upper air — perhaps those , too , who had looked coldly on , and smiled at his outward aspirations after fame or distinction ; but more than all , he desired to see one whom he once and still dearly loved , who had been a sufferer for his sake , and whom he proposed to make mistress of his fireside and the sharer of his fortunes . Even while whispering of love to Charlotte Hamilton , on the banks of the Devon , or sighing out the affected sentimentalities of platonic or pastoral love in the ear of Clarinda , his thoughts wandered to her whom he had left bleaching her webs among the daisies on Mauchline braes — she had still his heart , and in spite of her own and her father 's disclamation , she was his wife . It was one of the delusions of this great poet , as well as of those good people , the Armours , that the marriage had been dissolved by the destruction of the marriage-lines , and that Robert Burns and Jean Armour were as single as though they had neither vowed nor written themselves man and wife . Be that as it may , the time was come when all scruples and obstacles were to be removed which stood in the way of their union : their hands were united by Gavin Hamilton , according to law , in April , 1788 : and even the Reverend Mr. Auld , so mercilessly lampooned , smiled forgivingly as the poet satisfied a church wisely scrupulous regarding the sacred ceremony of marriage .</p>
   <p>Though Jean Armour was but a country lass of humble degree , she had sense and intelligence , and personal charms sufficient not only to win and fix the attentions of the poet , but to sanction the praise which he showered on her in song . In a letter to Mrs. Dunlop , he thus describes her : “ The most placid good nature and sweetness of disposition , a warm heart , gratefully devoted with all its powers to love me ; vigorous health and sprightly cheerfulness , set off to the best advantage by a more than commonly handsome figure : these I think in a woman may make a good wife , though she should never have read a page but the Scriptures , nor have danced in a brighter assembly than a penny-pay wedding . ” To the accomplished Margaret Chalmers , of Edinburgh , he adds , to complete the picture , “ I have got the handsomest figure , the sweetest temper , the soundest constitution , and kindest heart in the country : a certain late publication of Scots ’ poems she has perused very devoutly , and all the ballads in the land , as she has the finest wood-note wild you ever heard . ” With his young wife , a punch bowl of Scottish marble , and an eight-day clock , both presents from Mr. Armour , now reconciled to his eminent son-in-law , with a new plough , and a beautiful heifer , given by Mrs. Dunlop , with about four hundred pounds in his pocket , a resolution to toil , and a hope of success , Burns made his appearance on the banks of the Nith , and set up his staff at Ellisland . This farm , now a classic spot , is about six miles up the river from Dumfries ; it extends to upwards of a hundred acres : the soil is kindly ; the holmland portion of it loamy and rich , and it has at command fine walks on the river side , and views of the Friar 's Carse , Cowehill , and Dalswinton . For a while the poet had to hide his head in a smoky hovel ; till a house to his fancy , and offices for his cattle and his crops were built , his accommodation was sufficiently humble ; and his mind taking its hue from his situation , infused a bitterness into the letters in which he first made known to his western friends that he had fixed his abode in Nithsdale . “ I am here , ” said he , “ at the very elbow of existence : the only things to be found in perfection in this country are stupidity and canting ; prose they only know in graces and prayers , and the value of these they estimate as they do their plaiden-webs , by the ell : as for the muses , they have as much an idea of a rhinoceros as of a poet . ” “ This is an undiscovered clime , ” he at another period exclaims , “ it is unknown to poetry , and prose never looked on it save in drink . I sit by the fire , and listen to the hum of the spinning-wheel : I hear , but cannot see it , for it is hidden in the smoke which eddies round and round me before it seeks to escape by window and door . I have no converse but with the ignorance which encloses me : No kenned face but that of my old mare , Jenny Geddes — my life is dwindled down to mere existence . ”</p>
   <p>When the poet 's new house was built and plenished , and the atmosphere of his mind began to clear , he found the land to be fruitful , and its people intelligent and wise . In Riddel , of Friar 's Carse , he found a scholar and antiquarian ; in Miller , of Dalswinton , a man conversant with science as well as with the world ; in M'Murdo , of Drumlanrig , a generous and accomplished gentleman ; and in John Syme , of Ryedale , a man much after his own heart , and a lover of the wit and socialities of polished life . Of these gentlemen Riddel , who was his neighbour , was the favourite : a door was made in the march-fence which separated Ellisland from Friar 's Carse , that the poet might indulge in the retirement of the Carse hermitage , a little lodge in the wood , as romantic as it was beautiful , while a pathway was cut through the dwarf oaks and birches which fringed the river bank , to enable the poet to saunter and muse without lot or interruption . This attention was rewarded by an inscription for the hermitage , written with elegance as well as feeling , and which was the first fruits of his fancy in this unpoetic land . In a happier strain he remembered Matthew Henderson : this is one of the sweetest as well as happiest of his poetic compositions . He heard of his friend 's death , and called on nature animate and inanimate , to lament the loss of one who held the patent of his honours from God alone , and who loved all that was pure and lovely and good . “ The Whistle ” is another of his Ellisland compositions : the contest which he has recorded with such spirit and humour took place almost at his door : the heroes were Fergusson , of Craigdarroch , Sir Robert Laurie , of Maxwelltown , and Riddel , of the Friar 's Carse : the poet was present , and drank bottle and bottle about with the best , and when all was done he seemed much disposed , as an old servant at Friar 's Carse remembered , to take up the victor .</p>
   <p>Burns had become fully reconciled to Nithsdale , and was on the most intimate terms with the muse when he produced Tam O ’ Shanter , the crowning glory of all his poems . For this marvellous tale we are indebted to something like accident : Francis Grose , the antiquary , happened to visit Friar 's Carse , and as he loved wine and wit , the total want of imagination was no hinderance to his friendly intercourse with the poet : “ Alloway 's auld haunted kirk ” was mentioned , and Grose said he would include it in his illustrations of the antiquities of Scotland , if the bard of the Doon would write a poem to accompany it . Burns consented , and before he left the table , the various traditions which belonged to the ruin were passing through his mind . One of these was of a farmer , who , on a night wild with wind and rain , on passing the old kirk was startled by a light glimmering inside the walls ; on drawing near he saw a caldron hung over a fire , in which the heads and limbs of children were simmering : there was neither witch nor fiend to guard it , so he unhooked the caldron , turned out the contents , and carried it home as a trophy . A second tradition was of a man of Kyle , who , having been on a market night detained late in Ayr , on crossing the old bridge of Doon , on his way home , saw a light streaming through the gothic window of Alloway kirk , and on riding near , beheld a batch of the district witches dancing merrily round their master , the devil , who kept them “ louping and flinging ” to the sound of a bagpipe . He knew several of the old crones , and smiled at their gambols , for they were dancing in their smocks : but one of them , and she happened to be young and rosy , had on a smock shorter than those of her companions by two spans at least , which so moved the farmer that he exclaimed , “ Weel luppan , Maggie wi ’ the short sark ! ” Satan stopped his music , the light was extinguished , and out rushed the hags after the farmer , who made at the gallop for the bridge of Doon , knowing that they could not cross a stream : he escaped ; but Maggie , who was foremost , seized his horse 's tail at the middle of the bridge , and pulled it off in her efforts to stay him .</p>
   <p>This poem was the work of a single day : Burns walked out to his favourite musing path , which runs towards the old tower of the Isle , along Nithside , and was observed to walk hastily and mutter as he went . His wife knew by these signs that he was engaged in composition , and watched him from the window ; at last wearying , and moreover wondering at the unusual length of his meditations , she took her children with her and went to meet him ; but as he seemed not to see her , she stept aside among the broom to allow him to pass , which he did with a flushed brow and dropping eyes , reciting these lines aloud :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Now Tam ! O , Tum ! had thae been queans ,</l>
     <l n="2">A ’ plump and strapping in their teens ,</l>
     <l n="3">Their sacks , instead o ’ creeshie flannen ,</l>
     <l n="4">Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen !</l>
     <l n="5">Thir breeks o ’ mine , my only pair ,</l>
     <l n="6">That ance were plush , o ’ gude blue hair ,</l>
     <l n="7">I wad hae gien them off my hurdies ,</l>
     <l n="8">For ae blink o ’ the bonnie burdies ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He embellished this wild tradition from fact as well as from fancy : along the road which Tam came on that eventful night his memory supplied circumstances which prepared him for the strange sight at the kirk of Alloway . A poor chapman had perished , some winters before , in the snow ; a murdered child had been found by some early hunters ; a tippling farmer had fallen from his horse at the expense of his neck , beside a “ meikle stane ” ; and a melancholy old woman had hanged herself at the bush aboon the well , as the poem relates : all these matters the poet pressed into the service of the muse , and used them with a skill which adorns rather than oppresses the legend . A pert lawyer from Dumfries objected to the language as obscure : “ Obscure , sir ! ” said Burns ; “ you know not the language of that great master of your own art — the devil . If you had a witch for your client you would not be able to manage her defence ! ”</p>
   <p>He wrote few poems after his marriage , but he composed many songs : the sweet voice of Mrs. Burns and the craving of Johnson 's Museum will in some measure account for the number , but not for their variety , which is truly wonderful . In the history of that mournful strain , “ Mary in Heaven , ” we read the story of many of his lyrics , for they generally sprang from his personal feelings : no poet has put more of himself into his poetry than Burns , “ Robert , though ill of a cold , ” said his wife , “ had been busy all day — a day of September , 1789 , with the shearers in the field , and as he had got most of the corn into the stack-yard , was in good spirits ; but when twilight came he grew sad about something , and could not rest : he wandered first up the waterside , and then went into the stack-yard : I followed , and begged him to come into the house , as he was ill , and the air was sharp and cold . He said , ‘ Ay , ay , ’ but did not come : he threw himself down on some loose sheaves , and lay looking at the sky , and particularly at a large , bright star , which shone like another moon . At last , but that was long after I had left him , he came home — the song was already composed . ” To the memory of Mary Campbell he dedicated that touching ode ; and he thus intimates the continuance of his early affection for “ The fair haired lass of the west , ” in a letter of that time to Mrs. Dunlop . “ If there is another life , it must be only for the just , the benevolent , the amiable , and the humane . What a flattering idea , then , is a world to come ! There shall I , with speechless agony of rapture , again recognise my lost , my ever dear Mary , whose bosom was fraught with truth , honour , constancy , and love . ” These melancholy words gave way in their turn to others of a nature lively and humorous : “ Tam Glen , ” in which the thoughts flow as freely as the waters of the Nith , on whose banks he wrote it ; “ Findlay , ” with its quiet vein of sly simplicity ; “ Willie brewed a peck o ’ maut , ” the first of social , and “ She 's fair and fause , ” the first of sarcastic songs , with “ The deil 's awa wi ’ the Exciseman , ” are all productions of this period — a period which had besides its own fears and its own forebodings .</p>
   <p>For a while Burns seemed to prosper in his farm : he held the plough with his own hand , he guided the harrows , he distributed the seed-corn equally among the furrows , and he reaped the crop in its season , and saw it safely covered in from the storms of winter with “ thack and rape ; ” his wife , too , superintended the dairy with a skill which she had brought from Kyle , and as the harvest , for a season or two , was abundant , and the dairy yielded butter and cheese for the market , it seemed that “ the luckless star ” which ruled his lot had relented , and now shone unboding and benignly . But much more is required than toil of hand to make a successful farmer , nor will the attention bestowed only by fits and starts , compensate for carelessness or oversight : frugality , not in one thing but in all , is demanded , in small matters as well as in great , while a careful mind and a vigilant eye must superintend the labours of servants , and the whole system of in-door and out-door economy . Now , during the three years which Burns stayed in Ellisland , he neither wrought with that constant diligence which farming demands , nor did he bestow upon it the unremitting attention of eye and mind which such a farm required : besides his skill in husbandry was but moderate — the rent , though of his own fixing , was too high for him and for the times ; the ground , though good , was not so excellent as he might have had on the same estate — he employed more servants than the number of acres demanded , and spread for them a richer board than common : when we have said this we need not add the expensive tastes induced by poetry , to keep readers from starting , when they are told that Burns , at the close of the third year of occupation , resigned his lease to the landlord , and bade farewell for ever to the plough . He was not , however , quite desolate ; he had for a year or more been appointed on the excise , and had superintended a district extending to ten large parishes , with applause ; indeed , it has been assigned as the chief reason for failure in his farm , that when the plough or the sickle summoned him to the field , he was to be found , either pursuing the defaulters of the revenue , among the valleys of Dumfrieshire , or measuring out pastoral verse to the beauties of the land . He retired to a house in the Bank-vennel of Dumfries , and commenced a town-life : he commenced it with an empty pocket , for Ellisland had swallowed up all the profits of his poems : he had now neither a barn to produce meal nor barley , a barn-yard to yield a fat hen , a field to which he could go at Martinmas for a mart , nor a dairy to supply milk and cheese and butter to the table — he had , in short , all to buy and little to buy with . He regarded it as a compensation that he had no farm-rent to provide , no bankruptcies to dread , no horse to keep , for his excise duties were now confined to Dumfries , and that the burthen of a barren farm was removed from his mind , and his muse at liberty to renew her unsolicited strains .</p>
   <p>But from the day of his departure from “ the barren ” Ellisland , the downward course of Burns may be dated . The cold neglect of his country had driven him back indignantly to the plough , and he hoped to gain from the furrowed field that independence which it was the duty of Scotland to have provided : but he did not resume the plough with all the advantages he possessed when he first forsook it : he had revelled in the luxuries of polished life — his tastes had been rendered expensive as well as pure : he had witnessed , and he hoped for the pleasures of literary retirement , while the hands which had led jewelled dames over scented carpets to supper tables leaded with silver took hold of the hilts of the plough with more of reluctance than good-will . Edinburgh , with its lords and its ladies , its delights and its hopes , spoiled him for farming . Nor were his new labours more acceptable to his haughty spirit than those of the plough : the excise for a century had been a word of opprobrium or of hatred in the north : the duties which it imposed were regarded , not by peasants alone , as a serious encroachment upon the ancient rights of the nation , and to mislead a gauger , or resist him , even to blood , was considered by few as a fault . That the brightest genius of the nation — one whose tastes and sensibilities were so peculiarly its own — should be , as a reward , set to look after run-rum and smuggled tobacco , and to gauge ale-wife 's barrels , was a regret and a marvel to many , and a source of bitter merriment to Burns himself .</p>
   <p>The duties of his situation were however performed punctually , if not with pleasure : he was a vigilant officer ; he was also a merciful and considerate one : though loving a joke , and not at all averse to a dram , he walked among suspicious brewers , captious ale-wives , and frowning shop-keepers as uprightly as courteously : he smoothed the ruggedest natures into acquiescence by his gayety and humour , and yet never gave cause for a malicious remark , by allowing his vigilance to slumber . He was brave , too , and in the capture of an armed smuggler , in which he led the attack , showed that he neither feared water nor fire : he loved , also , to counsel the more forward of the smugglers to abandon their dangerous calling ; his sympathy for the helpless poor induced him to give them now and then notice of his approach ; he has been known to interpret the severe laws of the excise into tenderness and mercy in behalf of the widow and the fatherless . In all this he did but his duty to his country and his kind : and his conduct was so regarded by a very competent and candid judge . “ Let me look at the books of Burns , ” said Maxwell , of Terraughty , at the meeting of the district magistrates , “ for they show that an upright officer may be a merciful one . ” With a salary of some seventy pounds a year , the chance of a few guineas annually from the future editions of his poems , and the hope of rising at some distant day to the more lucrative situation of supervisor , Burns continued to live in Dumfries ; first in the Bank-vennel , and next in a small house in a humble street , since called by his name .</p>
   <p>In his earlier years the poet seems to have scattered songs as thick as a summer eve scatters its dews ; nor did he scatter them less carelessly : he appears , indeed , to have thought much less of them than of his poems : the sweet song of Mary Morison , and others not at all inferior , lay unregarded among his papers till accident called them out to shine and be admired . Many of these brief but happy compositions , sometimes with his name , and oftener without , he threw in dozens at a time into Johnson , where they were noticed only by the captious Ritson : but now a work of higher pretence claimed a share in his skill : in September , 1792 , he was requested by George Thomson to render , for his national collection , the poetry worthy of the muses of the north , and to take compassion on many choice airs , which had waited for a poet like the author of the Cotter 's Saturday Night , to wed them to immortal verse . To engage in such an undertaking , Burns required small persuasion , and while Thomson asked for strains delicate and polished , the poet characteristically stipulated that his contributions were to be without remuneration , and the language seasoned with a sprinkling of the Scottish dialect . As his heart was much in the matter , he began to pour out verse with a readiness and talent unknown in the history of song : his engagement with Thomson , and his esteem for Johnson , gave birth to a series of songs as brilliant as varied , and as naturally easy as they were gracefully original . In looking over those very dissimilar collections it is not difficult to discover that the songs which he wrote for the more stately work , while they are more polished and elegant than those which he contributed to the less pretending one , are at the same time less happy in their humour and less simple in their pathos . “ What pleases me as simple and naive , ” says Burns to Thomson , “ disgusts you as ludicrous and low . For this reason ‘ Fye , gie me my coggie , sirs , ’ ‘ Fye , let us a ’ to the bridal , ’ with several others of that cast , are to me highly pleasing , while ‘ Saw ye my Father ’ delights me with its descriptive simple pathos : ” we read in these words the reasons of the difference between the lyrics of the two collections .</p>
   <p>The land where the poet lived furnished ready materials for song : hills with fine woods , vales with clear waters , and dames as lovely as any recorded in verse , were to be had in his walks and his visits ; while , for the purposes of mirth or of humour , characters , in whose faces originality was legibly written , were as numerous in Nithsdale as he had found them in the west . He had been reproached , while in Kyle , with seeing charms in very ordinary looks , and hanging the garlands of the muse on unlovely altars ; he was liable to no such censure in Nithsdale ; he poured out the incense of poetry only on the fair and captivating : his Jeans , his Lucys , his Phillises , and his Jessies were ladies of such mental or personal charms as the Reynolds 's and the Lawrences of the time would have rejoiced to lay out their choicest colours on . But he did not limit himself to the charms of those whom he could step out to the walks and admire : his lyrics give evidence of the wandering of his thoughts to the distant or the dead — he loves to remember Charlotte Hamilton and Mary Campbell , and think of the sighs and vows on the Devon and the Doon , while his harpstrings were still quivering to the names of the Millers and the M'Murdos — to the charms of the lasses with golden or with flaxen locks , in the valley where he dwelt . Of Jean M'Murdo and her sister Phillis he loved to sing ; and their beauty merited his strains : to one who died in her bloom , Lucy Johnston , he addressed a song of great sweetness ; to Jessie Lewars , two or three songs of gratitude and praise : nor did he forget other beauties , for the accomplished Mrs. Riddel is remembered , and the absence of fair Clarinda is lamented in strains both impassioned and pathetic .</p>
   <p>But the main inspirer of the latter songs of Burns was a young woman of humble birth : of a form equal to the most exquisite proportions of sculpture , with bloom on her cheeks , and merriment in her large bright eyes , enough to drive an amatory poet crazy . Her name was Jean Lorimer ; she was not more than seventeen when the poet made her acquaintance , and though she had got a sort of brevet-right from an officer of the army , to use his southron name of Whelpdale , she loved best to be addressed by her maiden designation , while the poet chose to veil her in the numerous lyrics , to which she gave life , under the names of “ Chloris , ” “ The lass of Craigie-burnwood , ” and “ The lassie wi ’ the lintwhite locks . ” Though of a temper not much inclined to conceal anything , Burns complied so tastefully with the growing demand of the age for the exterior decencies of life , that when the scrupling dames of Caledonia sung a new song in her praise , they were as unconscious whence its beauties came , as is the lover of art , that the shape and gracefulness of the marble nymph which he admires , are derived from a creature who sells the use of her charms indifferently to sculpture or to love . Fine poetry , like other arts called fine , springs from “ strange places , ” as the flower in the fable said , when it bloomed on the dunghill ; nor is Burns more to be blamed than was Raphael , who painted Madonnas , and Magdalens with dishevelled hair and lifted eyes , from a loose lady , whom the pope , “ Holy at Rome — here Antichrist , ” charitably prescribed to the artist , while he laboured in the cause of the church . Of the poetic use which he made of Jean Lorimer 's charms , Burns gives this account to Thomson . “ The lady of whom the song of Craigie-burnwood was made is one of the finest women in Scotland , and in fact is to me in a manner what Sterne 's Eliza was to him — a mistress , or friend , or what you will , in the guileless simplicity of platonic love . I assure you that to my lovely friend you are indebted for many of my best songs . Do you think that the sober gin-horse routine of my existence could inspire a man with life and love and joy — could fire him with enthusiasm , or melt him with pathos , equal to the genius of your book ? No ! no ! Whenever I want to be more than ordinary in song — to be in some degree equal to your diviner airs — do you imagine I fast and pray for the celestial emanation ? Quite the contrary . I have a glorious recipe ; the very one that for his own use was invented by the divinity of healing and poesy , when erst he piped to the flocks of Admetus . I put myself in a regimen of admiring a fine woman ; and in proportion to the adorability of her charms , in proportion are you delighted with my verses . The lightning of her eye is the godhead of Parnassus , and the witchery of her smile , the divinity of Helicon . ”</p>
   <p>Most of the songs which he composed under the influences to which I have alluded are of the first order : “ Bonnie Lesley , ” “ Highland Mary , ” “ Auld Rob Morris , ” “ Duncan Gray , ” “ Wandering Willie , ” “ Meg o ’ the Mill , ” “ The poor and honest sodger , ” “ Bonnie Jean , ” “ Phillis the fair , ” “ John Anderson my Jo , ” “ Had I a cave on some wild distant shore , ” “ Whistle and I 'll come to you , my lad , ” “ Bruce 's Address to his men at Bannockburn , ” “ Auld Lang Syne , ” “ Thine am I , my faithful fair , ” “ Wilt thou be my dearie , ” “ O Chloris , mark how green the groves , ” “ Contented wi ’ little , and cantie wi ’ mair , ” “ Their groves of sweet myrtle , ” “ Last May a braw wooer came down the long glen , ” “ O Mally 's meek , Mally 's sweet , ” “ Hey for a lass wi ’ a tocher , ” “ Here 's a health to ane I loe dear , ” and the “ Fairest maid on Devon banks . ” Many of the latter lyrics of Burns were more or less altered , to put them into better harmony with the airs , and I am not the only one who has wondered that a bard so impetuous and intractable in most matters , should have become so soft and pliable , as to make changes which too often sacrificed the poetry for the sake of a fuller and more swelling sound . It is true that the emphatic notes of the music must find their echo in the emphatic words of the verse , and that words soft and liquid are fitter for ladies ’ lips , than words hissing and rough ; but it is also true that in changing a harsher word for one more harmonious the sense often suffers , and that happiness of expression , and that dance of words which lyric verse requires , lose much of their life and vigour . The poet 's favourite walk in composing his songs was on a beautiful green sward on the northern side of the Nith , opposite Lincluden : and his favourite posture for composition at home was balancing himself on the hind legs of his arm-chair .</p>
   <p>While indulging in these lyrical nights , politics penetrated into Nithsdale , and disturbed the tranquillity of that secluded region . First , there came a contest far the representation of the Dumfries district of boroughs , between Patrick Miller , younger , of Dalswinton , and Sir James Johnstone , of Westerhall , and some two years afterwards , a struggle for the representation of the county of Kirkcudbright , between the interest of the Stewarts , of Galloway , and Patrick Heron , of Kerroughtree . In the first of these the poet mingled discretion with his mirth , and raised a hearty laugh , in which both parties joined ; for this sobriety of temper , good reasons may be assigned : Miller , the elder , of Dalswinton , had desired to oblige him in the affair of Ellisland , and his firm and considerate friend , M'Murdo , of Drumlanrig , was chamberlain to his Grace of Queensbury , on whoso interest Miller stood . On the other hand , his old Jacobitical affections made him the secret well-wisher to Westerhall , for up to this time , at least till acid disappointment and the democratic doctrine of the natural equality of man influenced him , Burns , or as a western rhymer of his day and district worded the reproach — Rob was a Tory . His situation , it will therefore be observed , disposed him to moderation , and accounts for the milkiness of his Epistle to Fintray , in which he marshals the chiefs of the contending factions , and foretells the fierceness of the strife , without pretending to foresee the event . Neither is he more explicit , though infinitely more humorous , in his ballad of “ The Five Carlins , ” in which he impersonates the five boroughs — Dumfries , Kirkcudbright , Lochmaben , Sanquhar , and Annan , and draws their characters as shrewd and calculating dames , met in much wrath and drink to choose a representative .</p>
   <p>But the two or three years which elapsed between the election for the boroughs , and that for the county adjoining , wrought a serious change in the temper as well as the opinions of the poet . His Jacobitism , as has been said was of a poetic kind , and put on but in obedience to old feelings , and made no part of the man : he was in his heart as democratic as the kirk of Scotland , which educated him — he acknowledged no other superiority but the mental : “ he was disposed , too , ” said Professor Walker , “ from constitutional temper , from education and the accidents of life , to a jealousy of power , and a keen hostility against every system which enabled birth and opulence to anticipate those rewards which he conceived to belong to genius and virtue . ” When we add to this , a resentment of the injurious treatment of the dispensers of public patronage , who had neglected his claims , and showered pensions and places on men unworthy of being named with him , we have assigned causes for the change of side and the tone of asperity and bitterness infused into “ The Heron Ballads . ” Formerly honey was mixed with his gall : a little praise sweetened his censure : in these election lampoons he is fierce and even venomous :— no man has a head but what is empty , nor a heart that is not black : men descended without reproach from lines of heroes are stigmatized as cowards , and the honest and conscientious are reproached as miserly , mean , and dishonourable . Such is the spirit of party . “ I have privately , ” thus writes the poet to Heron , “ printed a good many copies of the ballads , and have sent them among friends about the country . You have already , as your auxiliary , the sober detestation of mankind on the heads of your opponents ; find I swear by the lyre of Thalia , to muster on your side all the votaries of honest laughter and fair , candid ridicule . ” The ridicule was uncandid , and the laughter dishonest . The poet was unfortunate in his political attachments : Miller gained the boroughs which Burns wished he might lose , and Heron lost the county which he foretold he would gain . It must also be recorded against the good taste of the poet , that he loved to recite “ The Heron Ballads , ” and reckon them among his happiest compositions .</p>
   <p>From attacking others , the poet was — in the interval between penning these election lampoons — called on to defend himself : for this he seems to have been quite unprepared , though in those yeasty times he might have expected it . “ I have been surprised , confounded , and distracted , ” he thus writes to Graham , of Fintray , “ by Mr. Mitchell , the collector , telling me that he has received an order from your board to inquire into my political conduct , and blaming me as a person disaffected to government . Sir , you are a husband and a father : you know what you would feel , to see the much-loved wife of your bosom , and your helpless prattling little ones , turned adrift into the world , degraded and disgraced , from a situation in which they had been respectable and respected . I would not tell a deliberate falsehood , no , not though even worse horrors , if worse can be than those I have mentioned , hung over my head , and I say that the allegation , whatever villain has made it , is a lie ! To the British constitution , on Revolution principles , next after my God , I am devotedly attached . To your patronage as a man of some genius , you have allowed me a claim ; and your esteem as an honest man I know is my due . To these , sir , permit me to appeal : by these I adjure you to save me from that misery which threatens to overwhelm me , and which with my latest breath I will say I have not deserved . ” In this letter , another , intended for the eye of the Commissioners of the Board of Excise , was enclosed , in which he disclaimed entertaining the idea of a British republic — a wild dream of the day — but stood by the principles of the constitution of 1688 , with the wish to see such corruptions as had crept in , amended . This last remark , it appears , by a letter from the poet to Captain Erskine , afterwards Earl of Mar , gave great offence , for Corbet , one of the superiors , was desired to inform him , “ that his business was to act , and not to think ; and that whatever might be men or measures , it was his duty to be silent and obedient . ” The intercession of Fintray , and the explanations of Burns , were so far effectual , that his political offense was forgiven , “ only I understand , ” said he , “ that all hopes of my getting officially forward are blasted . ” The records of the Excise Office exhibit no trace of this memorable matter , and two noblemen , who were then in the government , have assured me that this harsh proceeding received no countenance at head-quarters , and must have originated with some ungenerous or malicious person , on whom the poet had spilt a little of the nitric acid of his wrath .</p>
   <p>That Burns was numbered among the republicans of Dumfries I well remember : but then those who held different sentiments from the men in power , were all , in that loyal town , stigmatized as democrats : that he either desired to see the constitution changed , or his country invaded by the liberal French , who proposed to set us free with the bayonet , and then admit us to the “ fraternal embrace , ” no one ever believed . It is true that he spoke of premiers and peers with contempt ; that he hesitated to take off his hat in the theatre , to the air of “ God save the king ; ” that he refused to drink the health of Pitt , saying he preferred that of Washington — a far greater man ; that he wrote bitter words against that combination of princes , who desired to put down freedom in France ; that he said the titled spurred and the wealthy switched England and Scotland like two hack-horses ; and that all the high places of the land , instead of being filled by genius and talent , were occupied , as were the high-places of Israel , with idols of wood or of stone . But all this and more had been done and said before by thousands in this land , whose love of their country was never questioned . That it was bad taste to refuse to remove his hat when other heads were bared , and little better to refuse to pledge in company the name of Pitt , because he preferred Washington , cannot admit of a doubt ; but that he deserved to be written down traitor , for mere matters of whim or caprice , or to be turned out of the unenvied situation of “ gauging auld wives ’ barrels , ” because he thought there were some stains on the white robe of the constitution , seems a sort of tyranny new in the history of oppression . His love of country is recorded in too many undying lines to admit of a doubt now : nor is it that chivalrous love alone which men call romantic ; it is a love which may be laid up in every man 's heart and practised in every man 's life ; the words are homely , but the words of Burns are always expressive :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The kettle of the kirk and state</l>
     <l n="2">Perhaps a clout may fail i n't ,</l>
     <l n="3">But deil a foreign tinkler loon</l>
     <l n="4">Shall ever ca ’ a nail i n't .</l>
     <l n="5">Be Britons still to Britons true ,</l>
     <l n="6">Amang ourselves united ;</l>
     <l n="7">For never but by British hands</l>
     <l n="8">Shall British wrongs be righted . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But while verses , deserving as these do to become the national motto , and sentiments loyal and generous , were overlooked and forgotten , all his rash words about freedom , and his sarcastic sallies about thrones and kings , were treasured up to his injury , by the mean and the malicious . His steps were watched and his words weighed ; when he talked with a friend in the street , he was supposed to utter sedition ; and when ladies retired from the table , and the wine circulated with closed doors , he was suspected of treason rather than of toasting , which he often did with much humour , the charms of woman ; even when he gave as a sentiment , “ May our success be equal to the justice of our cause , ” he was liable to be challenged by some gunpowder captain , who thought that we deserved success in war , whether right or wrong . It is true that he hated with a most cordial hatred all who presumed on their own consequence , whether arising from wealth , titles , or commissions in the army ; officers he usually called “ the epauletted puppies , ” and lords he generally spoke of as “ feather-headed fools , ” who could but strut and stare and be no answer in kind to retort his satiric flings , his unfriends reported that it was unsafe for young men to associate with one whose principles were democratic , and scarcely either modest or safe for young women to listen to a poet whose notions of female virtue were so loose and his songs so free . These sentiments prevailed so far that a gentleman on a visit from London , told me he was dissuaded from inviting Burns to a dinner , given by way of welcome back to his native place , because he was the associate of democrats and loose people ; and when a modest dame of Dumfries expressed , through a friend , a wish to have but the honour of speaking to one of whose genius she was an admirer , the poet declined the interview , with a half-serious smile , saying , “ Alas ! she is handsome , and you know the character publicly assigned to me . ” She escaped the danger of being numbered , it is likely , with the Annas and the Chlorises of his freer strains .</p>
   <p>The neglect of his country , the tyranny of the Excise , and the downfall of his hopes and fortunes , were now to bring forth their fruits — the poet 's health began to decline . His drooping looks , his neglect of his person , his solitary saunterings , his escape from the stings of reflection into socialities , and his distempered joy in the company of beauty , all spoke , as plainly as with a tongue , of a sinking heart and a declining body . Yet though he was sensible of sinking health , hope did not at once desert him : he continued to pour out such tender strains , and to show such flashes of wit and humour at the call of Thomson , as are recorded of no other lyrist : neither did he , when in company after his own mind , hang the head , and speak mournfully , but talked and smiled and still charmed all listeners by his witty vivacities .</p>
   <p>On the 20th of June , 1795 , he writes thus of his fortunes and condition to his friend Clarke , “ Still , still the victim of affliction ; were you to see the emaciated figure who now holds the pen to you , you would not know your old friend . Whether I shall ever get about again is only known to HIM , the Great Unknown , whoso creature I am . Alas , Clarke , I begin to fear the worst ! As to my individual self I am tranquil , and would despise myself if I were not : but Burns 's poor widow and half-a-dozen of his dear little ones , helpless orphans ! Here I am as weak as a woman 's tear . Enough of this ! ‘ tis half my disease . I duly received your last , enclosing the note : it came extremely in time , and I am much obliged to your punctuality . Again I must request you to do me the same kindness . Be so very good as by return of post to enclose me another note : I trust you can do so without inconvenience , and it will seriously oblige me . If I must go , I leave a few friends behind me , whom I shall regret while consciousness remains . I know I shall live in their remembrance . O , dear , dear Clarke ! that I shall ever see you again is I am afraid highly improbable . ” This remarkable letter proves both the declining health , and the poverty of the poet : his digestion was so bad that he could taste neither flesh nor fish : porridge and milk he could alone swallow , and that but in small quantities . When it is recollected that he had no more than thirty shillings a week to keep house , and live like a gentleman , no one need wonder that his wife had to be obliged to a generous neighbour for some of the chief necessaries for her coming confinement , and that the poet had to beg , in extreme need , two guinea notes from a distant friend .</p>
   <p>His sinking state was not unobserved by his friends , and Syme and M'Murdo united with Dr. Maxwell in persuading him , at the beginning of the summer , to seek health at the Brow-well , a few miles east of Dumfries , where there were pleasant walks on the Solway-side , and salubrious breezes from the sea , which it was expected would bring the health to the poet they had brought to many . For a while , his looks brightened up , and health seemed inclined to return : his friend , the witty and accomplished Mrs. Riddel , who was herself ailing , paid him a visit . “ I was struck , ” she said , “ with his appearance on entering the room : the stamp of death was impressed on his features . His first words were , ‘ Well , Madam , have you any commands for the other world ? ’ I replied that it seemed a doubtful case which of us should be there soonest ; he looked in my face with an air of great kindness , and expressed his concern at seeing me so ill , with his usual sensibility . At table he ate little or nothing : we had a long conversation about his present state , and the approaching termination of all his earthly prospects . He showed great concern about his literary fame , and particularly the publication of his posthumous works ; he said he was well aware that his death would occasion some noise , and that every scrap of his writing would be revived against him , to the injury of his future reputation ; that letters and verses , written with unguarded freedom , would be handed about by vanity or malevolence when no dread of his resentment would restrain them , or prevent malice or envy from pouring forth their venom on his name . I had seldom seen his mind greater , or more collected . There was frequently a considerable degree of vivacity in his sallies ; but the concern and dejection I could not disguise , damped the spirit of pleasantry he seemed willing to indulge . ” This was on the evening of the 5th of July ; another lady who called to see him , found him seated at a window , gazing on the sun , then setting brightly on the summits of the green hills of Nithsdale . “ Look how lovely the sun is , ” said the poet , “ but he will soon have done with shining for me . ”</p>
   <p>He now longed for home : his wife , whom he ever tenderly loved , was about to be confined in child-bed : his papers were in sad confusion , and required arrangement ; and he felt that desire to die , at least , among familiar things and friendly faces , so common to our nature . He had not long before , though much reduced in pocket , refused with scorn an offer of fifty pounds , which a speculating bookseller made , for leave to publish his looser compositions ; he had refused an offer of the like sum yearly , from Perry of the Morning Chronicle , for poetic contributions to his paper , lest it might embroil him with the ruling powers , and he had resented the remittance of five pounds from Thomson , on account of his lyric contributions , and desired him to do so no more , unless he wished to quarrel with him ; but his necessities now , and they had at no time been so great , induced him to solicit five pounds from Thomson , and ten pounds from his cousin , James Burness , of Montrose , and to beg his friend Alexander Cunningham to intercede with the Commissioners of Excise , to depart from their usual practice , and grant him his full salary ; “ for without that , ” he added , “ if I die not of disease , I must perish with hunger . ” Thomson sent the five pounds , James Burness sent the ten , but the Commissioners of Excise refused to be either merciful or generous . Stobie , a young expectant in the customs , was both ;— he performed the duties of the dying poet , and refused to touch the salary . The mind of Burns was haunted with the fears of want and the terrors of a jail ; nor were those fears without foundation ; one Williamson , to whom he was indebted for the cloth to make his volunteer regimentals , threatened the one ; and a feeling that he was without money for either his own illness or the confinement of his wife , threatened the other .</p>
   <p>Burns returned from the Brow-well , on the 18th of July : as he walked from the little carriage which brought him up the Mill hole-brae to his own door , he trembled much , and stooped with weakness and pain , and kept his feet with difficulty : his looks were woe-worn and ghastly , and no one who saw him , and there were several , expected to see him again in life . It was soon circulated through Dumfries , that Burns had returned worse from the Brow-well ; that Maxwell thought ill of him , and that , in truth , he was dying . The anxiety of all classes was great ; differences of opinion were forgotten , in sympathy for his early fate : wherever two or three were met together their talk was of Burns , of his rare wit , matchless humour , the vivacity of his conversation , and the kindness of his heart . To the poet himself , death , which he now knew was at hand , brought with it no fear ; his good-humour , which small matters alone ruffled , did not forsake him , and his wit was ever ready . He was poor — he gave his pistols , which he had used against the smugglers on the Solway , to his physician , adding with a smile , that he had tried them and found them an honour to their maker , which was more than he could say of the bulk of mankind ! He was proud — he remembered the indifferent practice of the corps to which he belonged , and turning to Gibson , one of his fellow-soldiers , who stood at his bedside with wet eyes , “ John , ” said he , and a gleam of humour passed over his face , “ pray do n't let the awkward-squad fire over me . ” It was almost the last act of his life to copy into his Common-place Book , the letters which contained the charge against him of the Commissioners of Excise , and his own eloquent refutation , leaving judgment to be pronounced by the candour of posterity .</p>
   <p>It has been injuriously said of Burns , by Coleridge , that the man sunk , but the poet was bright to the last : he did not sink in the sense that these words imply : the man was manly to the latest draught of breath . That he was a poet to the last , can be proved by facts , as well as by the word of the author of Christabel . As he lay silently growing weaker and weaker , he observed Jessie Lewars , a modest and beautiful young creature , and sister to one of his brethren of the Excise , watching over him with moist eyes , and tending him with the care of a daughter ; he rewarded her with one of those songs which are an insurance against forgetfulness . The lyrics of the north have nothing finer than this exquisite stanza :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Altho ’ thou maun never be mine ,</l>
     <l n="2">Altho ’ even hope is denied ,</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis sweeter for thee despairing ,</l>
     <l n="4">Than aught in the world beside . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His thoughts as he lay wandered to Charlotte Hamilton , and he dedicated some beautiful stanzas to her beauty and her coldness , beginning , “ Fairest maid on Devon banks . ”</p>
   <p>It was a sad sight to see the poet gradually sinking ; his wife in hourly expectation of her sixth confinement , and his four helpless children — a daughter , a sweet child , had died the year before — with no one of their lineage to soothe them with kind words or minister to their wants . Jessie Lewars , with equal prudence and attention , watched over them all : she could not help seeing that the thoughts of the desolation which his death would bring , pressed sorely on him , for he loved his children , and hoped much from his boys . He wrote to his father-in-law , James Armour , at Mauchline , that he was dying , his wife nigh her confinement , and begged that his mother-in-law would hasten to them and speak comfort . He wrote to Mrs. Dunlop , saying , “ I have written to you so often without receiving any answer that I would not trouble you again , but for the circumstances in which I am . An illness which has long hung about me in all probability will speedily send me beyond that bourne whence no traveller returns . Your friendship , with which for many years you honoured me , was a friendship dearest to my soul : your conversation and your correspondence were at once highly entertaining and instructive — with what pleasure did I use to break up the seal ! The remembrance yet adds one pulse more to my poor palpitating heart . Farewell ! ” A tremor pervaded his frame ; his tongue grew parched , and he was at times delirious : on the fourth day after his return , when his attendant , James Maclure , held his medicine to his lips , he swallowed it eagerly , rose almost wholly up , spread out his hands , sprang forward nigh the whole length of the bed , fell on his face , and expired . He died on the 21st of July , when nearly thirty-seven years and seven months old .</p>
   <p>The burial of Burns , on the 25th of July , was an impressive and mournful scene : half the people of Nithsdale and the neighbouring parts of Galloway had crowded into Dumfries , to see their poet “ mingled with the earth , ” and not a few had been permitted to look at his body , laid out for interment . It was a calm and beautiful day , and as the body was borne along the street towards the old kirk-yard , by his brethren of the volunteers , not a sound was heard but the measured step and the solemn music : there was no impatient crushing , no fierce elbowing — the crowd which filled the street seemed conscious of what they were now losing for ever . Even while this pageant was passing , the widow of the poet was taken in labour ; but the infant born in that unhappy hour soon shared his father 's grave . On reaching the northern nook of the kirk-yard , where the grave was made , the mourners halted ; the coffin was divested of the mort-cloth , and silently lowered to its resting-place , and as the first shovel-full of earth fell on the lid , the volunteers , too agitated to be steady , justified the fears of the poet , by three ragged volleys . He who now writes this very brief and imperfect account , was present : he thought then , as he thinks now , that all the military array of foot and horse did not harmonize with either the genius or the fortunes of the poet , and that the tears which he saw on many cheeks around , as the earth was replaced , were worth all the splendour of a show which mocked with unintended mockery the burial of the poor and neglected Burns . The body of the poet was , on the 5th of June , 1815 , removed to a more commodious spot in the same burial-ground — his dark , and waving locks looked then fresh and glossy — to afford room for a marble monument , which embodies , with neither skill nor grace , that well-known passage in the dedication to the gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt :— “ The poetic genius of my country found me , as the prophetic bard , Elijah , did Elisha , at the plough , and threw her inspiring mantle over me . ” The dust of the bard was again disturbed , when the body of Mrs. Burns was laid , in April , 1834 , beside the remains of her husband : his skull was dug up by the district craniologists , to satisfy their minds by measurement that he was equal to the composition of “ Tam o ’ Shanter , ” or “ Mary in Heaven . ” This done , they placed the skull in a leaden box , “ carefully lined with the softest materials , ” and returned it , we hope for ever , to the hallowed ground .</p>
   <p>Thus lived and died Robert Burns , the chief of Scottish poets : in his person he was tall and sinewy , and of such strength and activity , that Scott alone , of all the poets I have seen , seemed his equal : his forehead was broad , his hair black , with an inclination to curl , his visage uncommonly swarthy , his eyes large , dark and lustrous , and his voice deep and manly . His sensibility was strong , his passions full to overflowing , and he loved , nay , adored , whatever was gentle and beautiful . He had , when a lad at the plough , an eloquent word and an inspired song for every fair face that smiled on him , and a sharp sarcasm or a fierce lampoon for every rustic who thwarted or contradicted him . As his first inspiration came from love , he continued through life to love on , and was as ready with the lasting incense of the muse for the ladies of Nithsdale as for the lasses of Kyle : his earliest song was in praise of a young girl who reaped by his side , when he was seventeen — his latest in honour of a lady by whose side he had wandered and dreamed on the banks of the Devon . He was of a nature proud and suspicious , and towards the close of his life seemed disposed to regard all above him in rank as men who unworthily possessed the patrimony of genius : he desired to see the order of nature restored , and worth and talent in precedence of the base or the dull . He had no medium in his hatred or his love ; he never spared the stupid , as if they were not to be endured because he was bright ; and on the heads of the innocent possessors of titles or wealth he was ever ready to shower his lampoons . He loved to start doubts in religion which he knew inspiration only could solve , and he spoke of Calvinism with a latitude of language that grieved pious listeners . He was warm-hearted and generous to a degree , above all men , and scorned all that was selfish and mean with a scorn quite romantic . He was a steadfast friend and a good neighbour : while he lived at Ellisland few passed his door without being entertained at his table ; and even when in poverty , on the Millhole-brae , the poor seldom left his door but with blessings on their lips .</p>
   <p>Of his modes of study he has himself informed us , as well as of the seasons and the places in which he loved to muse . He composed while he strolled along the secluded banks of the Doon , the Ayr , or the Nith : as the images crowded on his fancy his pace became quickened , and in his highest moods he was excited even to tears . He loved the winter for its leafless trees , its swelling floods , and its winds which swept along the gloomy sky , with frost and snow on their wings : but he loved the autumn more — he has neglected to say why — the muse was then more liberal of her favours , and he composed with a happy alacrity unfelt in all other seasons . He filled his mind and heart with the materials of song — and retired from gazing on woman 's beauty , and from the excitement of her charms , to record his impressions in verse , as a painter delineates oil his canvas the looks of those who sit to his pencil . His chief place of study at Ellisland is still remembered : it extends along the river-bank towards the Isle : there the neighbouring gentry love to walk and peasants to gather , and hold it sacred , as the place where he composed Tam O ’ Shanter . His favourite place of study when residing in Dumfries , was the ruins of Lincluden College , made classic by that sublime ode , “ The Vision , ” and that level and clovery sward contiguous to the College , on the northern side of the Nith : the latter place was his favourite resort ; it is known now by the name of Burns 's musing ground , and there he conceived many of his latter lyrics . In case of interruption he completed the verses at the fireside , where he swung to and fro in his arm-chair till the task was done : he then submitted the song to the ordeal of his wife 's voice , which was both sweet and clear , and while she sung he listened attentively , and altered or amended till the whole was in harmony , music and words .</p>
   <p>The genius of Burns is of a high order : in brightness of expression and unsolicited ease and natural vehemence of language , he stands in the first rank of poets : in choice of subjects , in happiness of conception , and loftiness of imagination , he recedes into the second . He owes little of his fame to his objects , for , saving the beauty of a few ladies , they were all of an ordinary kind : he sought neither in romance nor in history for themes to the muse ; he took up topics from life around which were familiar to all , and endowed them with character , with passion , with tenderness , with humour — elevating all that he touched into the regions of poetry and morals . He went to no far lands for the purpose of surprising us with wonders , neither did he go to crowns or coronets to attract the stare of the peasantry around him , by things which to them were as a book shut and sealed : “ The Daisy ” grew on the lands which he ploughed ; “ The Mouse ” built her frail nest on his own stubble-field ; “ The Haggis ” reeked on his own table ; “ The Scotch Drink ” of which he sang was the produce of a neighbouring still ; “ The Twa Dogs , ” which conversed so wisely and wittily , were , one of them at least , his own collies ; “ The Vision ” is but a picture , and a brilliant one , of his own hopes and fears ; “ Tam Samson ” was a friend whom he loved ; “ Doctor Hornbook ” a neighbouring pedant ; “ Matthew Henderson ” a social captain on half-pay ; “ The Scotch Bard ” who had gone to the West Indies was Burns himself ; the heroine of “ The Lament ” was Jean Armour ; and “ Tam O ’ Shanter ” a facetious farmer of Kyle , who rode late and loved pleasant company , nay , even “ The Deil ” himself , whom he had the hardihood to address , was a being whose eldrich croon bad alarmed the devout matrons of Kyle , and had wandered , not unseen by the bard himself , among the lonely glens of the Doon . Burns was one of the first to teach the world that high moral poetry resided in the humblest subjects : whatever he touched became elevated ; his spirit possessed and inspired the commonest topics , and endowed them with life and beauty .</p>
   <p>His songs have all the beauties and but few of them the faults of his poems : they flow to the music as readily as if both air and words came into the world together . The sentiments are from nature , they are rarely strained or forced , and the words dance in their places and echo the music in its pastoral sweetness , social glee , or in the tender and the moving . He seems always to write with woman 's eye upon him : he is gentle , persuasive and impassioned : he appears to watch her looks , and pours out his praise or his complaint according to the changeful moods of her mind . He looks on her , too , with a sculptor 's as well as a poet 's eye : to him who works in marble , the diamonds , emeralds , pearls , and elaborate ornaments of gold , but load and injure the harmony of proportion , the grace of form , and divinity of sentiment of his nymph or his goddess — so with Burns the fashion of a lady 's boddice , the lustre of her satins , or the sparkle of her diamonds , or other finery with which wealth or taste has loaded her , are neglected us idle frippery ; while her beauty , her form , or her mind , matters which are of nature and not of fashion , are remembered and praised . He is none of the millinery bards , who deal in scented silks , spider-net laces , rare gems , set in rarer workmanship , and who shower diamonds and pearls by the bushel on a lady 's locks : he makes bright eyes , flushing cheeks , the magic of the tongue , and the “ pulses ’ maddening play ” perform all . His songs are , in general , pastoral pictures : he seldom finishes a portrait of female beauty without enclosing it in a natural frame-work of waving woods , running streams , the melody of birds , and the lights of heaven . Those who desire to feel Burns in all his force , must seek some summer glen , when a country girl searches among his many songs for one which sympathizes with her own heart , and gives it full utterance , till wood and vale is filled with the melody . It is remarkable that the most naturally elegant and truly impassioned songs in our literature were written by a ploughman in honour of the rustic lasses around him .</p>
   <p>His poetry is all life and energy , and bears the impress of a warm heart and a clear understanding : it abounds with passions and opinions — vivid pictures of rural happiness and the raptures of successful love , all fresh from nature and observation , and not as they are seen through the spectacles of books . The wit of the clouted shoe is there without its coarseness : there is a prodigality of humour without licentiousness , a pathos ever natural and manly , a social joy akin sometimes to sadness , a melancholy not unallied to mirth , and a sublime morality which seeks to elevate and soothe . To a love of man he added an affection for the flowers of the valley , the fowls of the air , and the beasts of the field : he perceived the tie of social sympathy which united animated with unanimated nature , and in many of his finest poems most beautifully he has enforced it . His thoughts are original and his style new and unborrowed : all that he has written is distinguished by a happy carelessness , a bounding elasticity of spirit , and a singular felicity of expression , simple yet inimitable ; he is familiar yet dignified , careless , yet correct , and concise , yet clear and full . All this and much more is embodied in the language of humble life — a dialect reckoned barbarous by scholars , but which , coming from the lips of inspiration , becomes classic and elevated .</p>
   <p>The prose of this great poet has much of the original merit of his verse , but it is seldom so natural and so sustained : it abounds with fine outflashings and with a genial warmth and vigour , but it is defaced by false ornament and by a constant anxiety to say fine and forcible things . He seems not to know that simplicity was as rare and as needful a beauty in prose as in verse ; he covets the pauses of Sterne and the point and antithesis of Junius , like one who believes that to write prose well he must be ever lively , ever pointed , and ever smart . Yet the account which he wrote of himself to Dr. Moore is one of the most spirited and natural narratives in the language , and composed in a style remote from the strained and groped-for witticisms and put-on sensibilities of many of his letters :— “ Simple , ” as John Wilson says , “ we may well call it ; rich in fancy , overflowing in feeling , and dashed off in every other paragraph with the easy boldness of a great master . ”</p>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <head>[ The first edition , printed at Kilmarnock , July , 1786 , by John Wilson , bore on the title-page these simple words :— “ Poems , chiefly in the Scottish Dialect , by Robert Burns ; ” the following motto , marked “ Anonymous , ” but evidently the poet 's own composition , was more ambitious :—</head>
     <l n="1">“ The simple Bard , unbroke by rules of art ,</l>
     <l n="2">He pours the wild effusions of the heart :</l>
     <l n="3">And if inspired , ‘ tis nature 's pow'rs inspire —</l>
     <l n="4">Hers all the melting thrill , and hers the kindling fire . ” ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The following trifles are not the production of the Poet , who , with all the advantages of learned art , and perhaps amid the elegancies and idlenesses of upper life , looks down for a rural theme with an eye to Theocritus or Virgil . To the author of this , these , and other celebrated names their countrymen , are , at least in their original language , a fountain shut up , and a book sealed . Unacquainted with the necessary requisites for commencing poet by rule , he sings the sentiments and manners he felt and saw in himself and his rustic compeers around him in his and their native language . Though a rhymer from his earliest years , at least from the earliest impulse of the softer passions , it was not till very lately that the applause , perhaps the partiality , of friendship awakened his vanity so for as to make him think anything of his worth showing : and none of the following works were composed with a view to the press . To amuse himself with the little creations of his own fancy , amid the toil and fatigue of a laborious life ; to transcribe the various feelings — the loves , the griefs , the hopes , the fears — in his own breast ; to find some kind of counterpoise to the struggles of a world , always an alien scene , a task uncouth to the poetical mind — these were his motives for courting the Muses , and in these he found poetry to be its own reward .</p>
   <p>Now that he appears in the public character of an author , he does it with fear and trembling . So dear is fame to the rhyming tribe , that even he , an obscure , nameless Bard , shrinks aghast at the thought of being branded as — an impertinent blockhead , obtruding his nonsense on the world ; and , because he can make a shift to jingle a few doggerel Scotch rhymes together , looking upon himself as a poet of no small consequence , forsooth !</p>
   <p>It is an observation of that celebrated poet , Shenstone , whose divine elegies do honour to our language , our nation , and our species , that “ Humility has depressed many a genius to a hermit , but never raised one to fame ! ” If any critic catches at the word genius the author tells him , once for all , that he certainly looks upon himself as possessed of some poetic abilities , otherwise his publishing in the manner he has done would be a manoeuvre below the worst character , which , he hopes , his worst enemy will ever give him . But to the genius of a Ramsay , or the glorious dawnings of the poor , unfortunate Fergusson , he , with equal unaffected sincerity , declares , that even in his highest pulse of vanity , he has not the most distant pretensions . These two justly admired Scotch poets he has often had in his eye in the following pieces , but rather with a view to kindle at their flame , than for servile imitation .</p>
   <p>To his Subscriber , the Author returns his most sincere thanks . Not the mercenary bow over a counter , but the heart-throbbing gratitude of the Bard , conscious how much he owes to benevolence and friendship for gratifying him , if he deserves it , in that dearest wish of every poetic bosom — to be distinguished . He begs his readers , particularly the learned and the polite , who may honour him with a perusal , that they will make every allowance for education and circumstances of life ; but if , after a fair , candid , and impartial criticism , he shall stand convicted of dulness and nonsense , let him be done by as he would in that case do by others — let him be condemned , without mercy , in contempt and oblivion .</p>

    <head>WINTER .</head>
    <head>A DIRGE .</head>
    <note>This is one of the earliest of the poet 's recorded compositions : it was written before the death of his father , and is called by Gilbert Burns , ‘ a juvenile production . ’ To walk by a river while flooded , or through a wood on a rough winter day , and hear the storm howling among the leafless trees , exalted the poet 's thoughts . “ In such a season , ” he said , “ just after a train of misfortunes , I composed Winter , a Dirge . ”</note>

    <note>This tale is partly true ; the poet 's pet ewe got entangled in her tether , and tumbled into a ditch ; the face of ludicrous and awkward sorrow with which this was related by Hughoc , the herd-boy , amused Burns so much , who was on his way to the plough , that he immediately composed the poem , and repeated it to his brother Gilbert when they met in the evening ; the field where the poet held the plough , and the ditch into which poor Mailie fell , are still pointed out .</note>

    <note>Burns , when he calls on the bards of Ayr and Doon to join in the lament for Mailie , intimates that he regards himself as a poet . Hogg calls it a very elegant morsel : but says that it resembles too closely “ The Ewie and the Crooked Horn , ” to be admired as original : the shepherd might have remembered that they both resemble Sempill 's “ Life and death of the Piper of Kilbarchan . ”</note>

   <p>SECOND EPISTLE TO DAVIE ,</p>
   <p>A BROTHER POET .</p>
   <note>David Sillar , to whom these epistles are addressed , was at that time master of a country school , and was welcome to Burns both as a scholar and a writer of verse . This epistle he prefixed to his poems printed at Kilmarnock in the year 1789 : he loved to speak of his early comrade , and supplied Walker with some very valuable anecdotes : he died one of the magistrates of Irvine , on the 2d of May , 1830 , at the age of seventy .</note>

    <note>The beautiful and relenting spirit in which this fine poem finishes moved the heart on one of the coldest of our critics . “ It was , I think , ” says Gilbert Burns , “ in the winter of 1784 , as we were going with carts for coals to the family fire , and I could yet point out the particular spot , that Robert first repeated to me the ‘ Address to the Deil . ’ The idea of the address was suggested to him by running over in his mind the many ludicrous accounts we have of that august personage . ”</note>

    <note>“ Whenever Burns has occasion , ” says Hogg , “ to address or mention any subordinate being , however mean , even a mouse or a flower , then there is a gentle pathos in it that awakens the finest feelings of the heart . ” The Auld Farmer of Kyle has the spirit of knight-errant , and loves his mare according to the rules of chivalry ; and well he might : she carried him safely home from markets , triumphantly from wedding-brooses ; she ploughed the stiffest land ; faced the steepest brae , and , moreover , bore home his bonnie bride with a consciousness of the loveliness of the load .</note>

    <note>I have heard the third verse of this very moving Prayer quoted by scrupulous men as a proof that the poet imputed his errors to the Being who had endowed him with wild and unruly passions .

    <head>REMORSE .</head>
    <head>A FRAGMENT .</head>
    <note>“ I entirely agree , ” says Burns , “ with the author of the Theory of Moral Sentiments , that Remorse is the most painful sentiment that can embitter the human bosom ; an ordinary pitch of fortitude may bear up admirably well , under those calamities , in the procurement of which we ourselves have had no hand ; but when our follies or crimes have made us wretched , to bear all with manly firmness , and at the same time have a proper penitential sense of our misconduct , is a glorious effort of self-command . ”</note>

     <l n="2">That press the soul , or wring the mind with anguish ,</l>
     <l n="3">Beyond comparison the worst are those</l>
     <l n="4">That to our folly or our guilt we owe .</l>
     <l n="5">In every other circumstance , the mind</l>
     <l n="6">Has this to say , ‘ It was no deed of mine ; ’</l>
     <l n="7">But when to all the evil of misfortune</l>
     <l n="8">This sting is added — ‘ Blame thy foolish self ! ’</l>
     <l n="9">Or worser far , the pangs of keen remorse ;</l>
     <l n="10">The torturing , gnawing consciousness of guilt ,—</l>
     <l n="11">Of guilt , perhaps , where we 've involved others ;</l>
     <l n="12">The young , the innocent , who fondly lov 'd us ,</l>
     <l n="13">Nay , more , that very love their cause of ruin !</l>
     <l n="14">O burning hell ! in all thy store of torments ,</l>
     <l n="15">There 's not a keener lash !</l>
     <l n="16">Lives there a man so firm , who , while his heart</l>
     <l n="17">Feels all the bitter horrors of his crime ,</l>
     <l n="18">Can reason down its agonizing throbs ;</l>
     <l n="19">And , after proper purpose of amendment ,</l>
     <l n="20">Can firmly force his jarring thoughts to peace ?</l>

   <p>THE JOLLY BEGGARS .</p>
   <p>A CANTATA .</p>
   <note>This inimitable poem , unknown to Currie and unheardof while the poet lived , was first given to the world , with other characteristic pieces , by Mr. Stewart of Glasgow , in the year 1801 . Some have surmised that it is not the work of Burns ; but the parentage is certain : the original manuscript at the time of its composition , in 1785 , was put into the hands of Mr. Richmond of Mauchline , and afterwards given by Burns himself to Mr. Woodburn , factor of the laird of Craigen-gillan ; the song of “ For a ’ that , and a ’ that ” was inserted by the poet , with his name , in the Musical Museum of February , 1790 . Cromek admired , yet did not , from overruling advice , print it in the Reliques , for which he was sharply censured by Sir Walter Scott , in the Quarterly Review . The scene of the poem is in Mauchline , where Poosie Nancy had her change-house . Only one copy in the handwriting of Burns is supposed to exist ; and of it a very accurate fac-simile has been given .</note>

    <p>DEATH AND DR. HORNBOOK .</p>
    <p>A TRUE STORY .</p>
    <note>John Wilson , raised to the unwelcome elevation of hero to this poem , was , at the time of its composition , schoolmaster in Tarbolton : he as , it is said , a fair scholar , and a very worthy man , but vain of his knowledge in medicine — so vain , that he advertised his merits , and offered advice gratis . It was his misfortune to encounter Burns at a mason meeting , who , provoked by a long and pedantic speech , from the Dominie , exclaimed , the future lampoon dawning upon him , “ Sit down , Dr. Hornbook . ” On his way home , the poet seated himself on the ledge of a bridge , composed the poem , and , overcome with poesie and drink , fell asleep , and did not awaken till the sun was shining over Galston Moors . Wilson went afterwards to Glasgow , embarked in mercantile and matrimonial speculations , and prospered , and is still prospering .</note>

    <head>POPE .</head>
    <note>Of this sarcastic and too daring poem many copies in manuscript were circulated while the poet lived , but though not unknown or unfelt by Currie , it continued unpublished till printed by Stewart with the Jolly Beggars , in 1801 . Holy Willie was a small farmer , leading elder to Auld , a name well known to all lovers of Burns ; austere in speech , scrupulous in all outward observances , and , what is known by the name of a “ professing Christian . ” He experienced , however , a “ sore fall ; ” he permitted himself to be “ filled fou , ” and in a moment when “ self got in ” made free , it is said , with the money of the poor of the parish . His name was William Fisher .</note>

    <note>We are informed by Richmond of Mauchline , that when he was clerk in Gavin Hamilton 's office , Burns came in one morning and said , “ I have just composed a poem , John , and if you will write it , I will repeat it . ” He repeated Holy Willie 's Prayer and Epitaph ; Hamilton came in at the moment , and having read them with delight , ran laughing with them in his hand to Robert Aiken .

    <note>We have heard of a poor play-actor who , by a humorous inventory of his effects , so moved the commissioners of the income tax , that they remitted all claim on him then and forever ; we know not that this very humorous inventory of Burns had any such effect on Mr. Aiken , the surveyor of the taxes .

    <head>HYPOCRISY A-LA-MODE .</head>
    <note>The scene of this fine poem is the church-yard of Mauchline , and the subject handled so cleverly and sharply is the laxity of manners visible in matters so solemn and terrible as the administration of the sacrament . “ This was indeed , ” says Lockhart , “ an extraordinary performance : no partisan of any sect could whisper that malice had formed its principal inspiration , or that its chief attraction lay in the boldness with which individuals , entitled and accustomed to respect , were held up to ridicule : it was acknowledged , amidst the sternest mutterings of wrath , that national manners were once more in the hands of a national poet . ” “ It is no doubt , ” says Hogg , “ a reckless piece of satire , but it is a clever one , and must have cut to the bone . But much as I admire the poem I must regret that it is partly borrowed from Ferguson . ”</note>

   <note>This sarcastic sally was written on the admission of Mr. Mackinlay , as one of the ministers to the Laigh , or parochial Kirk of Kilmarnock , on the 6th of April , 1786 . That reverend person was an Auld Light professor , and his ordination incensed all the New Lights , hence the bitter levity of the poem . These dissensions have long since past away : Mackinlay , a pious and kind-hearted sincere man , lived down all the personalities of the satire , and though unwelcome at first , he soon learned to regard them only as a proof of the powers of the poet .</note>

    <head>BLAIR .</head>
    <note>The James Smith , to whom this epistle is addressed , was at that time a small shop-keeper in Mauchline , and the comrade or rather follower of the poet in all his merry expeditions with “ Yill-caup commentators . ” He was present in Poosie Nansie 's when the Jolly Beggars first dawned on the fancy of Burns : the comrades of the poet 's heart were not generally very successful in life : Smith left Mauchline , and established a calico-printing manufactory at Avon near Linlithgow , where his friend found him in all appearance prosperous in 1788 ; but this was not to last ; he failed in his speculations and went to the West Indies , and died early . His wit was ready , and his manners lively and unaffected .</note>

    <head>THE VISION .</head>
    <head>DUAN FIRST .<span corresp="#note19" type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span></head>
    <note>The Vision and the Briggs of Ayr , are said by Jeffrey to be “ the only pieces by Burns which can be classed under the head of pure fiction : ” but Tam O ’ Shanter and twenty other of his compositions have an equal right to be classed with works of fiction . The edition of this poem published at Kilmarnock , differs in some particulars from the edition which followed in Edinburgh . The maiden whose foot was so handsome as to match that of Coila , was a Bess at first , but old affection triumphed , and Jean , for whom the honour was from the first designed , regained her place . The robe of Coila , too , was expanded , so far indeed that she got more cloth than she could well carry .</note>

    <note>This Poem contains a lively and striking picture of some of the superstitious observances of old Scotland : on Halloween the desire to look into futurity was once all but universal in the north ; and the charms and spells which Burns describes , form but a portion of those employed to enable the peasantry to have a peep up the dark vista of the future . The scene is laid on the romantic shores of Ayr , at a farmer 's fireside , and the actors in the rustic drama are the whole household , including supernumerary reapers and bandsmen about to be discharged from the engagements of harvest . “ I never can help regarding this , ” says James Hogg , “ as rather a trivial poem ! ”</note>

    <head>MAN WAS MADE TO MOURN .</head>
    <head>A DIRGE .</head>
    <note>The origin of this fine poem is alluded to by Burns in one of his letters to Mrs. Dunlop : “ I had an old grand-uncle with whom my mother lived in her girlish years : the good old man was long blind ere he died , during which time his highest enjoyment was to sit and cry , while my mother would sing the simple old song of ‘ The Life and Age of Man . ’ ” From that truly venerable woman , long after the death of her distinguished son , Cromek , in collecting the Reliques , obtained a copy by recitation of the older strain . Though the tone and sentiment coincide closely with “ Man was made to Mourn , ” I agree with Lockhart , that Burns wrote it in obedience to his own habitual feelings .</note>

    <note>“ The epistle to John Lapraik , ” says Gilbert Burns , “ was produced exactly on the occasion described by the author . Rocking is a term derived from primitive times , when our country-women employed their spare hours in spinning on the roke or distaff . This simple instrument is a very portable one ; and well fitted to the social inclination of meeting in a neighbour 's house ; hence the phrase of going a rocking , or with the roke . As the connexion the phrase had with the implement was forgotten when the roke gave place to the spinning-wheel , the phrase came to be used by both sexes on social occasions , and men talk of going with their rokes as well as women . ”</note>

    <head>( SECOND EPISTLE . )</head>
    <head>[ The John Lapraik to whom these epistles are addressed lived at Dalfram in the neighbourhood of Muirkirk , and was a rustic worshipper of the Muse : he unluckily , however , involved himself in that Western bubble , the Ayr Bank , and consoled himself by composing in his distress that song which moved the heart of Burns , beginning</head>
     <l n="1">“ When I upon thy bosom lean . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He afterwards published a volume of verse , of a quality which proved that the inspiration in his song of domestic sorrow was no settled power of soul . ]</p>

    <head>( THIRD EPISTLE . )</head>
    <note>I have heard one of our most distinguished English poets recite with a sort of ecstasy some of the verses of these epistles , and praise the ease of the language and the happiness of the thoughts . He averred , however , that the poet , when pinched for a word , hesitated not to coin one , and instanced , “ tapetless , ” “ ramfeezled , ” and “ forjesket , ” as intrusions in our dialect . These words seem indeed , to some Scotchmen , strange and uncouth , but they are true words of the west .</note>

    <head>WILLIAM SIMPSON ,</head>
    <head>OCHILTREE .</head>
    <note>The person to whom this epistle is addressed , was schoolmaster of Ochiltree , and afterwards of New Lanark : he was a writer of verses too , like many more of the poet 's comrades ;— of verses which rose not above the barren level of mediocrity : “ one of his poems , ” says Chambers , “ was a laughable elegy on the death of the Emperor Paul . ” In his verses to Burns , under the name of a Tailor , there is nothing to laugh at , though they are intended to be laughable as well as monitory .</note>

    <note>This hasty and not very decorous effusion , was originally entitled “ The Poet 's Welcome ; or , Rab the Rhymer 's Address to his Bastard Child . ” A copy , with the more softened , but less expressive title , was published by Stewart , in 1801 , and is alluded to by Burns himself , in his biographical letter to Moore . “ Bonnie Betty , ” the mother of the “ sonsie-smirking , dear-bought Bess , ” of the Inventory , lived in Largieside : to support this daughter the poet made over the copyright of his works when he proposed to go to the West Indies . She lived to be a woman , and to marry one John Bishop , overseer at Polkemmet , where she died in 1817 . It is said she resembled Burns quite as much as any of the rest of his children .</note>

    <head>TO THE REV . JOHN M'MATH .</head>
    <note>Poor M'Math was at the period of this epistle assistant to Wodrow , minister of Tarbolton : he was a good preacher , a moderate man in matters of discipline , and an intimate of the Coilsfield Montgomerys . His dependent condition depressed his spirits : he grew dissipated ; and finally , it is said , enlisted as a common soldier , and died in a foreign land .</note>

    <p>NOVEMBER , 1785 .</p>
    <note>This beautiful poem was imagined while the poet was holding the plough , on the farm of Mossgiel : the field is still pointed out : and a man called Blane is still living , who says he was gaudsman to the bard at the time , and chased the mouse with the plough-pettle , for which he was rebuked by his young master , who inquired what harm the poor mouse had done him . In the night that followed , Burns awoke his gaudsman , who was in the same bed with him , recited the poem as it now stands , and said , “ What think you of our mouse now ? ”</note>

    <head>PARODY ON MILTON</head>
    <head>[ “ This Poem was written , ” says Burns , “ before the act anent the Scottish distilleries , of session 1786 , for which Scotland and the author return their most grateful thanks . ” Before the passing of this lenient act , so sharp was the law in the North , that some distillers relinquished their trade ; the price of barley was affected , and Scotland , already exasperated at the refusal of a militia , for which she was a petitioner , began to handle her claymore , and was perhaps only hindered from drawing it by the act mentioned by the poet . In an early copy of the poem , he thus alludes to Colonel Hugh Montgomery , afterwards Earl of Eglinton :—</head>
     <l n="1">“ Thee , sodger Hugh , my watchman stented ,</l>
     <l n="2">If bardies e'er are represented ,</l>
     <l n="3">I ken if that yere sword were wanted</l>
     <l n="4">Ye 'd lend yere hand ;</l>
     <l n="5">But when there 's aught to say anent it</l>
     <l n="6">Yere at a stand . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The poet was not sure that Montgomery would think the compliment to his ready hand an excuse in full for the allusion to his unready tongue , and omitted the stanza . ]</p>

   <note>“ Burns , ” says Hogg , in a note on this Poem , “ has written more from his own heart and his own feelings than any other poet . External nature had few charms for him ; the sublime shades and hues of heaven and earth never excited his enthusiasm : but with the secret fountains of passion in the human soul he was well acquainted . ” Burns , indeed , was not what is called a descriptive poet : yet with what exquisite snatches of description are some of his poems adorned , and in what fragrant and romantic scenes he enshrines the heroes and heroines of many of his finest songs ! Who the high , exalted , virtuous dames were , to whom the Poem refers , we are not told . How much men stand indebted to want of opportunity to sin , and how much of their good name they owe to the ignorance of the world , were inquiries in which the poet found pleasure .</note>

    <head>POPE .</head>
    <head>[ Tam Samson was a west country seedsman and sportsman , who loved a good song , a social glass , and relished a shot so well that he expressed a wish to die and be buried in the moors . On this hint Burns wrote the Elegy : when Tam heard o ’ this he waited on the poet , caused him to recite it , and expressed displeasure at being numbered with the dead : the author , whose wit was as ready as his rhymes , added the Per Contra in a moment , much to the delight of his friend . At his death the four lines of Epitaph were cut on his gravestone . “ This poem has always , ” says Hogg , “ been a great country favourite : it abounds with happy expressions .</head>

    <note>The hero and heroine of this little mournful poem , were Robert Burns and Jean Armour . “ This was a most melancholy affair , ” says the poet in his letter to Moore , “ which I cannot yet bear to reflect on , and had very nearly given me one or two of the principal qualifications for a place among those who have lost the chart and mistaken the reckoning of rationality . ” Hogg and Motherwell , with an ignorance which is easier to laugh at than account for , say this Poem was “ written on the occasion of Alexander Cunningham 's darling sweetheart alighting him and marrying another :— she acted a wise part . ” With what care they had read the great poet whom they jointly edited in is needless to say : and how they could read the last two lines of the third verse and commend the lady 's wisdom for slighting her lover , seems a problem which defies definition . This mistake was pointed out by a friend , and corrected in a second issue of the volume .</note>

    <head>DESPONDENCY .</head>
    <head>AN ODE .</head>
    <note>“ I think , ” said Burns , “ it is one of the greatest pleasures attending a poetic genius , that we can give our woes , cares , joys , and loves an embodied form in verse , which to me is ever immediate ease . ” He elsewhere says , “ My passions raged like so many devils till they got vent in rhyme . ” That eminent painter , Fuseli , on seeing his wife in a passion , said composedly , “ Swear my love , swear heartily : you know not how much it will ease you ! ” This poem was printed in the Kilmarnock edition , and gives a true picture of those bitter moments experienced by the bard , when love and fortune alike deceived him .</note>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>COTTER 'S SATURDAY NIGHT .</head>
    <head>INSCRIBED TO ROBERT AIKEN , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">“ Let not ambition mock their useful toil ,</l>
     <l n="2">Their homely joys , and destiny obscure :</l>
     <l n="3">Nor grandeur hear , with a disdainful smile ,</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>GRAY</head>
    <note>The house of William Burns was the scene of this fine , devout , and tranquil drama , and William himself was the saint , the father , and the husband , who gives life and sentiment to the whole . “ Robert had frequently remarked to me , ” says Gilbert Burns , “ that he thought there was something peculiarly venerable in the phrase , ‘ Let us worship God ! ’ used by a decent sober head of a family , introducing family worship . ” To this sentiment of the author the world is indebted for the “ Cotter 's Saturday Night . ” He owed some little , however , of the inspiration to Fergusson 's “ Farmer 's Ingle , ” a poem of great merit . The calm tone and holy composure of the Cotter 's Saturday Night have been mistaken by Hogg for want of nerve and life . “ It is a dull , heavy , lifeless poem , ” he says , “ and the only beauty it possesses , in my estimation , is , that it is a sort of family picture of the poet 's family . The worst thing of all , it is not original , but is a decided imitation of Fergusson 's beautiful pastoral , ‘ The Farmer 's Ingle : ’ I have a perfect contempt for all plagiarisms and imitations . ” Motherwell tries to qualify the censure of his brother editor , by quoting Lockhart 's opinion — at once lofty and just , of this fine picture of domestic happiness and devotion .</note>

    <head>ON TURNING ONE DOWN WITH THE PLOUGH IN</head>
    <head>APRIL , 1786 .</head>
    <note>This was not the original title of this sweet poem : I have a copy in the handwriting of Burns entitled “ The Gowan . ” This more natural name he changed as he did his own , without reasonable cause ; and he changed it about the same time , for he ceased to call himself Burness and his poem “ The Gowan , ” in the first edition of his works . The field at Mossgiel where he turned down the Daisy is said to be the same field where some five months before he turned up the Mouse ; but this seems likely only to those who are little acquainted with tillage — who think that in time and place reside the chief charms of verse ; and who feel not the beauty of “ The Daisy , ” till they seek and find the spot on which it grew . Sublime morality and the deepest emotions of the soul pass for little with those who remember only what the genius loves to forget .</note>

    <head>EPISTLE TO A YOUNG FRIEND .</head>
    <head>MAY , 1786 .</head>
    <note>Andrew Aikin , to whom this poem of good counsel is addressed , was one of the sons of Robert Aiken , writer in Ayr , to whom the Cotter 's Saturday Night is inscribed . He became a merchant in Liverpool , with what success we are not informed , and died at St. Petersburgh . The poet has been charged with a desire to teach hypocrisy rather than truth to his “ Andrew dear ; ” but surely to conceal one 's own thoughts and discover those of others , can scarcely be called hypocritical : it is , in fact , a version of the celebrated precept of prudence , “ Thoughts close and looks loose . ” Whether he profited by all the counsel showered upon him by the muse we know not : he was much respected — his name embalmed , like that of his father , in the poetry of his friend , is not likely soon to perish .</note>

    <head>ON SEEING ONE IN A LADY 'S BONNET , AT CHURCH</head>
    <note>A Mauchline incident of a Mauchline lady is related in this poem , which to many of the softer friends of the bard was anything but welcome : it appeared in the Kilmarnock copy of his Poems , and remonstrance and persuasion were alike tried in vain to keep it out of the Edinburgh edition . Instead of regarding it as a seasonable rebuke to pride and vanity , some of his learned commentators called it course and vulgar — those classic persons might have remembered that Julian , no vulgar person , but an emperor and a scholar , wore a populous beard , and was proud of it .</note>

    <head>ENCLOSING SOME POEMS .</head>
    <note>The person to whom these verses are addressed lived at Adamhill in Ayrshire , and merited the praise of rough and ready-witted , which the poem bestows . The humorous dream alluded to , was related by way of rebuke to a west country earl , who was in the habit of calling all people of low degree “ Brutes !— damned brutes . ” “ I dreamed that I was dead , ” said the rustic satirist to his superior , “ and condemned for the company I kept . When I came to hell-door , where mony of your lordship 's friends gang , I chappit , and ‘ Wha are ye , and where d'ye come frae ? ’ Satan exclaimed . I just said , that my name was Rankine , and I came frae yere lordship 's land . ‘ Awa wi ’ you , ’ cried Satan , ye canna come here : hell 's fou o ’ his lordship 's damned brutes already . ’ ”</note>

    <p>GONE TO THE WEST INDIES .</p>
    <note>Burns in this Poem , as well as in others , speaks openly of his tastes and passions : his own fortunes are dwelt on with painful minuteness , and his errors are recorded with the accuracy , but not the seriousness of the confessional . He seems to have been fond of taking himself to task . It was written when “ Hungry ruin had him in the wind , ” and emigration to the West Indies was the only refuge which he could think of , or his friends suggest , from the persecutions of fortune .</note>

   <note>This is another of the poet 's lamentations , at the prospect of “ torrid climes ” and the roars of the Atlantic . To Burns , Scotland was the land of promise , the west of Scotland his paradise ; and the land of dread , Jamaica ! I found these lines copied by the poet into a volume which he presented to Dr. Geddes : they were addressed , it is thought , to the “ Dear E . ” of his earliest correspondence .</note>

    <head>A DEDICATION</head>
    <head>TO</head>
    <head>GAVIN HAMILTON , ESQ .</head>
    <note>The gentleman to whom these manly lines are addressed , was of good birth , and of an open and generous nature : he was one of the first of the gentry of the west to encourage the muse of Coila to stretch her wings at full length . His free life , and free speech , exposed him to the censures of that stern divine , Daddie Auld , who charged him with the sin of absenting himself from church for three successive days ; for having , without the fear of God 's servant before him , profanely said damn it , in his presence , and far having gallopped on Sunday . These charges were contemptuously dismissed by the presbyterial court . Hamilton was the brother of the Charlotte to whose charms , on the banks of Devon , Burns , it is said , paid the homage of a lover , as well as of a poet . The poem had a place in the Kilmarnock edition , but not as an express dedication .</note>

    <note>Lockhart first gave this poetic curiosity to the world : he copied it from a small manuscript volume of Poems given by Burns to Lady Harriet Don , with an explanation in these words : “ W. Chalmers , a gentleman in Ayrshire , a particular friend of mine , asked me to write a poetic epistle to a young lady , his Dulcinea . I had seen her , but was scarcely acquainted with her , and wrote as follows . ” Chalmers was a writer in Ayr . I have not heard that the lady was influenced by this volunteer effusion : ladies are seldom rhymed into the matrimonial snare .</note>

    <head>IN THE ROOM WHERE HE SLEPT .</head>
    <note>Of the origin of those verses Gilbert Burns gives the following account . “ The first time Robert heard the spinet played was at the house of Dr. Lawrie , then minister of Loudon , now in Glasgow . Dr. Lawrie has several daughters ; one of them played ; the father and the mother led down the dance ; the rest of the sisters , the brother , the poet and the other guests mixed in it . It was a delightful family scene for our poet , then lately introduced to the world ; his mind was roused to a poetic enthusiasm , and the stanzas were left in the room where he slept . ”</note>

    <p>A BARD 'S EPITAPH .</p>
    <p>[ This beautiful and affecting poem was printed in the Kilmarnock edition : Wordsworth writes with his usual taste and feeling about it : “ Whom did the poet intend should be thought of , as occupying that grave , over which , after modestly setting forth the moral discernment and warm affections of the ‘ poor inhabitant ’ it is supposed to be inscribed that</p>
     <l n="1">‘ Thoughtless follies laid him low ,</l>

   <p>Who but himself — himself anticipating the but too probable termination of his own course ? Here is a sincere and solemn avowal — a confession at once devout , poetical , and human — a history in the shape of a prophecy !

    <head>THE TWA DOGS .</head>
    <head>A TALE .</head>
    <note>Cromek , an anxious and curious inquirer , informed me , that the Twa Dogs was in a half-finished state , when the poet consulted John Wilson , the printer , about the Kilmarnock edition . On looking over the manuscripts , the printer , with a sagacity common to his profession , said , “ The Address to the Deil ” and “ The Holy Fair ” were grand things , but it would be as well to have a calmer and sedater strain , to put at the front of the volume . Burns was struck with the remark , and on his way home to Mossgiel , completed the Poem , and took it next day to Kilmarnock , much to the satisfaction of “ Wee Johnnie . ” On the 17th February Burns says to John Richmond , of Mauchline , “ I have completed my Poem of the Twa Dogs , but have not shown it to the world . ” It is difficult to fix the dates with anything like accuracy , to compositions which are not struck off at one heat of the fancy . “ Luath was one of the poet 's dogs , which some person had wantonly killed , ” says Gilbert Burns ; “ but Cæsar was merely the creature of the imagination . ” The Ettrick Shepherd , a judge of collies , says that Luath is true to the life , and that many a hundred times he has seen the dogs bark for very joy , when the cottage children were merry .</note>

    <p>LINES</p>
    <p>ON</p>
    <p>MEETING WITH LORD DAER .</p>
    <note>“ The first time I saw Robert Burns , ” says Dugald Stewart , “ was on the 23rd of October , 1786 , when he dined at my house in Ayrshire , together with our common friend , John Mackenzie , surgeon in Mauchline , to whom I am indebted for the pleasure of his acquaintance . My excellent and much-lamented friend , the late Basil , Lord Daer , happened to arrive at Catrine the same day , and , by the kindness and frankness of his manners , left an impression on the mind of the poet which was never effaced . The verses which the poet wrote on the occasion are among the most imperfect of his pieces , but a few stanzas may perhaps be a matter of curiosity , both on account of the character to which they relate and the light which they throw on the situation and the feelings of the writer before his work was known to the public . ” Basil , Lord Daer , the uncle of the present Earl of Selkirk , was born in the year 1769 , at the family seat of St. Mary 's Isle : he distinguished himself early at school , and at college excelled in literature and science ; he had a greater regard for democracy than was then reckoned consistent with his birth and rank . He was , when Burns met him , in his twenty-third year ; was very tall , something careless in his dress , and had the taste and talent common to his distinguished family . He died in his thirty-third year .</note>

    <head>ADDRESS TO EDINBURGH .</head>
    <note>“ I enclose you two poems , ” said Burns to his friend Chalmers , “ which I have carded and spun since I passed Glenbuck . One blank in the Address to Edinburgh , ‘ Fair B ——, ’ is the heavenly Miss Burnet , daughter to Lord Monboddo , at whose house I have had the honour to be more than once . There has not been anything nearly like her , in all the combinations of beauty , grace , and goodness the great Creator has formed , since Milton 's Eve , on the first day of her existence . ” Lord Monboddo made himself ridiculous by his speculations on human nature , and acceptable by his kindly manners and suppers in the manner of the ancients , where his viands were spread under ambrosial lights , and his Falernian was wreathed with flowers . At these suppers Burns sometimes made his appearance . The “ Address ” was first printed in the Edinburgh edition : the poet 's hopes were then high , and his compliments , both to town and people , were elegant and happy .</note>

    <head>THE BRIGS OF AYR ,</head>
    <head>A POEM ,</head>
    <head>INSCRIBED TO J. BALLANTYNE , ESQ ., AYR .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">[ Burns took the hint of this Poem from the Planestanes and Causeway of</l>
     <l n="2">Fergusson , but all that lends it life and feeling belongs to his own</l>
     <l n="3">heart and his native Ayr : he wrote it for the second edition of his</l>
     <l n="4">poems , and in compliment to the patrons of his genius in the west .</l>
     <l n="5">Ballantyne , to whom the Poem is inscribed , was generous when the</l>
     <l n="6">distresses of his farming speculations pressed upon him : others of his</l>
     <l n="7">friends figure in the scene : Montgomery 's courage , the learning of</l>
     <l n="8">Dugald Stewart , and condescension and kindness of Mrs. General</l>

     <l n="10">The simple Bard , rough at the rustic plough ,</l>

     <l n="13">Hailing the setting sun , sweet , in the green thorn bush :</l>
     <l n="14">The soaring lark , the perching red-breast shrill ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or deep-ton 'd plovers , gray , wild-whistling o'er the hill ;</l>
     <l n="16">Shall he , nurst in the peasant 's lowly shed ,</l>
     <l n="17">To hardy independence bravely bred ,</l>
     <l n="18">By early poverty to hardship steel 'd ,</l>
     <l n="19">And train 'd to arms in stern misfortune 's field —</l>
     <l n="20">Shall he be guilty of their hireling crimes ,</l>
     <l n="21">The servile , mercenary Swiss of rhymes ?</l>
     <l n="22">Or labour hard the panegyric close ,</l>
     <l n="23">With all the venal soul of dedicating prose ?</l>
     <l n="24">No ! though his artless strains he rudely sings ,</l>
     <l n="25">And throws his hand uncouthly o'er the strings ,</l>
     <l n="26">He glows with all the spirit of the Bard ,</l>
     <l n="27">Fame , honest fame , his great , his dear reward !</l>

     <l n="31">And hands the rustic stranger up to fame ,</l>
     <l n="32">With heart-felt throes his grateful bosom swells ,</l>

    <head>THE DEATH OF ROBERT DUNDAS , ESQ .,</head>
    <head>OF ARNISTON ,</head>
    <head>LATE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF SESSION .</head>
    <note>At the request of Advocate Hay , Burns composed this Poem , in the hope that it might interest the powerful family of Dundas in his fortunes . I found it inserted in the handwriting of the poet , in an interleaved copy of his Poems , which he presented to Dr. Geddes , accompanied by the following surly note :— “ The foregoing Poem has some tolerable lines in it , but the incurable wound of my pride will not suffer me to correct , or even peruse it . I sent a copy of it with my best prose letter to the son of the great man , the theme of the piece , by the hands of one of the noblest men in God 's world , Alexander Wood , surgeon : when , behold ! his solicitorship took no more notice of my Poem , or of me , than I had been a strolling fiddler who had made free with his lady 's name , for a silly new reel . Did the fellow imagine that I looked for any dirty gratuity ? ” This Robert Dundas was the elder brother of that Lord Melville to whose hands , soon after these lines were written , all the government patronage in Scotland was confided , and who , when the name of Burns was mentioned , pushed the wine to Pitt , and said nothing . The poem was first printed by me , in 1834 .</note>

    <head>THE AMERICAN WAR .</head>
    <head>A FRAGMENT .</head>
    <note>Dr. Blair said that the politics of Burns smelt of the smithy , which , interpreted , means , that they were unstatesman-like , and worthy of a country ale-house , and an audience of peasants . The Poem gives us a striking picture of the humorous and familiar way in which the hinds and husbandmen of Scotland handle national topics : the smithy is a favourite resort , during the winter evenings , of rustic politicians ; and national affairs and parish scandal are alike discussed . Burns was in those days , and some time after , a vehement Tory : his admiration of “ Chatham 's Boy , ” called down on him the dusty indignation of the republican Ritson .</note>

    <note>This is the lady of the drinking-glasses ; the Mrs. Mac of many a toast among the poet 's acquaintances . She was , in those days , young and beautiful , and we fear a little giddy , since she indulged in that sentimental and platonic flirtation with the poet , contained in the well-known letters to Clarinda . The letters , after the poet 's death , appeared in print without her permission : she obtained an injunction against the publication , which still remains in force , but her anger seems to have been less a matter of taste than of whim , for the injunction has been allowed to slumber in the case of some editors , though it has been enforced against others .</note>

This particular part I send you , merely as a sample of my hand at portrait-sketching . ” It is probable that the professor 's response was not favourable for we hear no more of the Poem .</note>

    <head>EPISTLE TO WILLIAM CREECH .</head>
    <note>A storm of rain detained Burns one day , during his border tour , at Selkirk , and he employed his time in writing this characteristic epistle to Creech , his bookseller . Creech was a person of education and taste ; he was not only the most popular publisher in the north , but he was intimate with almost all the distinguished men who , in those days , adorned Scottish literature . But though a joyous man , a lover of sociality , and the keeper of a good table , he was close and parsimonious , and loved to hold money to the last moment that the law allowed .</note>

    <p>TO THE</p>
    <p>NOBLE DUKE OF ATHOLE .</p>
    <note>The Falls of Bruar in Athole are exceedingly beautiful and picturesque ; and their effect , when Burns visited them , was much impaired by want of shrubs and trees . This was in 1787 : the poet , accompanied by his future biographer , Professor Walker , went , when close on twilight , to this romantic scene : “ he threw himself , ” said the Professor , “ on a heathy seat , and gave himself up to a tender , abstracted , and voluptuous enthusiasm of imagination . In a few days I received a letter from Inverness , for the poet had gone on his way , with the Petition enclosed . ” His Grace of Athole obeyed the injunction : the picturesque points are now crowned with thriving woods , and the beauty of the Falls is much increased .</note>

    <note>This is one of the many fine scenes , in the Celtic Parnassus of Ossian : but when Burns saw it , the Highland passion of the stream was abated , for there had been no rain for some time to swell and send it pouring down its precipices in a way worthy of the scene . The descent of the water is about two hundred feet . There is another fall further up the stream , very wild and savage , on which the Fyers makes three prodigious leaps into a deep gulf where nothing can be seen for the whirling foam and agitated mist .</note>
     <l n="1">Among the heathy hills and ragged woods</l>
     <l n="2">The roaring Fyers pours his mossy floods ;</l>
     <l n="3">Till full he dashes on the rocky mounds ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where , thro ’ a shapeless breach , his stream resounds ,</l>
     <l n="5">As high in air the bursting torrents flow ,</l>
     <l n="6">As deep-recoiling surges foam below ,</l>
     <l n="7">Prone down the rock the whitening sheet descends ,</l>
     <l n="8">And viewless Echo 's ear , astonish 'd , rends .</l>
     <l n="9">Dim seen , through rising mists and ceaseless show'rs ,</l>
     <l n="10">The hoary cavern , wide surrounding , low'rs .</l>
     <l n="11">Still thro ’ the gap the struggling river toils ,</l>
     <l n="12">And still below , the horrid cauldron boils —</l>

    <note>When these verses were written there was much stately Jacobitism about Edinburgh , and it is likely that Tytler , who laboured to dispel the cloud of calumny which hung over the memory of Queen Mary , had a bearing that way .

    <head>ON NITHSIDE .</head>
    <head>DECEMBER , 1788 .</head>
    <note>Of this Poem Burns thought so well that he gave away many copies in his own handwriting : I have seen three . When corrected to his mind , and the manuscripts showed many changes and corrections , he published it in the new edition of his Poems as it stands in this second copy . The little Hermitage where these lines were written , stood in a lonely plantation belonging to the estate of Friars-Carse , and close to the march-dyke of Ellisland ; a small door in the fence , of which the poet had the key , admitted him at pleasure , and there he found seclusion such as he liked , with flowers and shrubs all around him . The first twelve lines of the Poem were engraved neatly on one of the window-panes , by the diamond pencil of the Bard . On Riddel 's death , the Hermitage was allowed to go quietly to decay : I remember in 1803 turning two outlyer stots out of the interior .</note>

Graham was one of the leading men of the Excise in Scotland , and had promised Burns a situation as exciseman : for this the poet had qualified himself ; and as he began to dread that farming would be unprofitable , he wrote to remind his patron of his promise , and requested to be appointed to a division in his own neighbourhood .

    <head>ON THE DEATH OF</head>
    <head>SIR JAMES HUNTER BLAIR .</head>
    <note>I found these lines written with a pencil in one of Burns 's memorandum-books : he said he had just composed them , and pencilled them down lest they should escape from his memory . They differed in nothing from the printed copy of the first Liverpool edition . That they are by Burns there cannot be a doubt , though they were , I know not for what reason , excluded from several editions of the Posthumous Works of the poet .</note>

    <note>Burns placed the portraits of Dr. Blacklock and the Earl of Glencairn , over his parlour chimney-piece at Ellisland : beneath the head of the latter he wrote some verses , which he sent to the Earl , and requested leave to make public . This seems to have been refused ; and , as the verses were lost for years , it was believed they were destroyed : a rough copy , however , is preserved , and is now in the safe keeping of the Earl 's name-son , Major James Glencairn Burns . James Cunningham , Earl of Glencairn , died 20th January , 1791 , aged 42 years ; he was succeeded by his only and childless brother , with whom this ancient race was closed .</note>

    <note>It was late in life before Burns began to think very highly of Fox : he had hitherto spoken of him rather as a rattler of dice , and a frequenter of soft company , than as a statesman .

    <head>LIMP BY ME ,</head>
    <head>WHICH A FELLOW HAD JUST SHOT .</head>
    <note>This Poem is founded on fact . A young man of the name of Thomson told me — quite unconscious of the existence of the Poem — that while Burns lived at Ellisland — he shot at and hurt a hare , which in the twilight was feeding on his father 's wheat-bread . The poet , on observing the hare come bleeding past him , “ was in great wrath , ” said Thomson , “ and cursed me , and said little hindered him from throwing me into the Nith ; and he was able enough to do it , though I was both young and strong . ” The boor of Nithside did not use the hare worse than the critical Dr. Gregory , of Edinburgh , used the Poem : when Burns read his remarks he said , “ Gregory is a good man , but he crucifies me ! ”</note>

    <head>A SATIRE .</head>
    <head>[ FIRST VERSION . ]</head>
    <note>The history of this Poem is curious . M'Gill , one of the ministers of Ayr , long suspected of entertaining heterodox opinions concerning original sin and the Trinity , published “ A Practical Essay on the Death of Jesus Christ , ” which , in the opinion of the more rigid portion of his brethren , inclined both to Arianism and Socinianism . This essay was denounced as heretical , by a minister of the name Peebles , in a sermon preached November 5th , 1788 , and all the west country was in a flame . The subject was brought before the Synod , and was warmly debated till M'Gill expressed his regret for the disquiet he had occasioned , explained away or apologized for the challenged passages in his Essay , and declared his adherence to the Standard doctrines of his mother church . Burns was prevailed upon to bring his satire to the aid of M'Gill , but he appears to have done so with reluctance .</note>

    <head>THE KIRK 'S ALARM .</head>
    <head>A BALLAD .</head>
    <head>[ SECOND VERSION . ]</head>
    <note>This version is from the papers of Miss Logan , of Afton . The origin of the Poem is thus related to Graham of Fintry by the poet himself : “ Though I dare say you have none of the solemn League and Covenant fire Which shone so conspicuous in Lord George Gordon , and the Kilmarnock weavers , yet I think you must have heard of Dr. M'Gill , one of the clergymen of Ayr , and his heretical book , God help him , poor man ! Though one of the worthiest , as well as one of the ablest of the whole priesthood of the Kirk of Scotland , in every sense of that ambiguous term , yet the poor doctor and his numerous family are in imminent danger of being thrown out ( 9th December , 1790 ) to the mercy of the winter winds . The enclosed ballad on that business , is , I confess too local : but I laughed myself at some conceits in it , though I am convinced in my conscience there are a good many heavy stanzas in it too . ” The Kirk 's Alarm was first printed by Stewart , in 1801 . Cromek calls it , “ A silly satire , on some worthy ministers of the gospel , in Ayrshire . ”</note>

   <note>Captain Matthew Henderson , a gentleman of very agreeable manners and great propriety of character , usually lived in Edinburgh , dined constantly at Fortune 's Tavern , and was a member of the Capillaire Club , which was composed of all who desired to be thought witty or joyous : he died in 1789 : Burns , in a note to the Poem , says , “ I loved the man much , and have not flattered his memory . ” Henderson seems indeed to have been universally liked . “ In our travelling party , ” says Sir James Campbell , of Ardkinglass , “ was Matthew Henderson , then ( 1759 ) and afterwards well known and much esteemed in the town of Edinburgh ; at that time an officer in the twenty-fifth regiment of foot , and like myself on his way to join the army ; and I may say with truth , that in the course of a long life I have never known a more estimable character , than Matthew Henderson . ” Memoirs of Campbell , of Ardkinglass , p. 17 .</note>

    <note>This “ fine , fat , fodgel wight ” was a clever man , a skilful antiquary , and fond of wit and wine . He was well acquainted with heraldry , and was conversant with the weapons and the armor of his own and other countries . He found his way to Friars-Carse , in the Vale of Nith , and there , at the social “ board of Glenriddel , ” for the first time saw Burns . The Englishman heard , it is said , with wonder , the sarcastic sallies and eloquent bursts of the inspired Scot , who , in his turn , surveyed with wonder the remarkable corpulence , and listened with pleasure to the independent sentiments and humourous turns of conversation in the joyous Englishman . This Poem was the fruit of the interview , and it is said that Grose regarded some passages as rather personal .</note>

    <head>GAWIN DOUGLAS</head>
    <note>This is a West-country legend , embellished by genius . No other Poem in our language displays such variety of power , in the same number of lines . It was written as an inducement to Grose to admit Alloway-Kirk into his work on the Antiquities of Scotland ; and written with such ecstasy , that the poet shed tears in the moments of composition . The walk in which it was conceived , on the braes of Ellisland , is held in remembrance in the vale , and pointed out to poetic inquirers : while the scene where the poem is laid — the crumbling ruins — the place where the chapman perished in the snow — the tree on which the poor mother of Mungo ended her sorrows — the cairn where the murdered child was found by the hunters — and the old bridge over which Maggie bore her astonished master when all hell was in pursuit , are first-rate objects of inspection and inquiry in the “ Land of Burns . ” “ In the inimitable tale of Tam o ’ Shanter , ” says Scott “ Burns has left us sufficient evidence of his ability to combine the ludicrous with the awful , and even the horrible . No poet , with the exception of Shakspeare , ever possessed the power of exciting the most varied and discordant emotions with such rapid transitions . ”</note>

    <head>PRESIDENT OF THE HIGHLAND SOCIETY .</head>
    <note>This Poem made its first appearance , as I was assured by my friend the late Thomas Pringle , in the Scots Magazine , for February , 1818 , and was printed from the original in the handwriting of Burns . It was headed thus , “ To the Right honorable the Earl of Brendalbyne , President of the Right Honourable and Honourable the Highland Society , which met on the 23d of May last , at the Shakspeare , Covent Garden , to concert ways and means to frustrate the designs of four hundred Highlanders , who , as the Society were informed by Mr. M. ——, of A —— s , were so audacious as to attempt an escape from their lawful lairds and masters , whose property they were , by emigrating from the lands of Mr. Macdonald , of Glengarry , to the wilds of Canada , in search of that fantastic thing — LIBERTY . ” The Poem was communicated by Burns to his friend Rankine of Adam Hill , in Ayrshire .</note>

To Mr. Taylor , a person of influence in the place , the poet , in despair , addressed this little Poem , begging his interference : Taylor spoke to a smith ; the smith flew to his tools , sharpened or frosted the shoes , and it is said lived for thirty years to boast that he had “ never been well paid but ance , and that was by a poet , who paid him in money , paid him in drink , and paid him in verse . ”</note>

    <head>LAMENT</head>
    <head>OF</head>
    <head>MARY , QUEEN OF SCOTS ,</head>
    <head>ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING .</head>
    <note>The poet communicated this “ Lament ” to his friend , Dr. Moore , in February , 1791 , but it was composed about the close of the preceding year , at the request of Lady Winifred Maxwell Constable , of Terreagles , the last in direct descent of the noble and ancient house of Maxwell , of Nithsdale . Burns expressed himself more than commonly pleased with this composition ; nor was he unrewarded , for Lady Winifred gave him a valuable snuff-box , with the portrait of the unfortunate Mary on the lid . The bed still keeps its place in Terreagles , on which the queen slept as she was on her way to take refuge with her cruel and treacherous cousin , Elizabeth ; and a letter from her no less unfortunate grandson , Charles the First , calling the Maxwells to arm in his cause , is preserved in the family archives .</note>

    <head>THE WHISTLE .</head>
    <head>[ “ As the authentic prose history , ” says Burns , “ of the ‘ Whistle ’ is curious , I shall here give it . In the train of Anne of Denmark , when she came to Scotland with our James the Sixth , there came over also a Danish gentleman of gigantic stature and great prowess , and a matchless champion of Bacchus . He had a little ebony whistle , which at the commencement of the orgies , he laid on the table , and whoever was the last able to blow it , everybody else being disabled by the potency of the bottle , was to carry off the whistle as a trophy of victory . The Dane produced credentials of his victories , without a single defeat , at the courts of Copenhagen , Stockholm , Moscow , Warsaw , and several of the petty courts in Germany ; and challenged the Scotch Bacchanalians to the alternative of trying his prowess , or else of acknowledging their inferiority . After man overthrows on the part of the Scots , the Dane was encountered by Sir Robert Lawrie , of Maxwelton , ancestor of the present worthy baronet of that name ; who , after three days and three nights ’ hard contest , left the Scandinavian under the table ,</head>
     <l n="1">‘ And blew on the whistle his requiem shrill . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Sir Walter , son to Sir Robert before mentioned , afterwards lost the whistle to Walter Riddel , of Glenriddel , who had married a sister of Sir Walter 's .— On Friday , the 16th of October , 1790 , at Friars-Carse , the whistle was once more contended for , as related in the ballad , by the present Sir Robert of Maxwelton ; Robert Riddel , Esq ., of Glenriddel , lineal descendant and representative of Walter Riddel , who won the whistle , and in whose family it had continued ; and Alexander Fergusson , Esq ., of Craigdarroch , likewise descended of the great Sir Robert ; which last gentleman carried off the hard-won honours of the field . ”</p>
   <p>The jovial contest took place in the dining-room of Friars-Carse , in the presence of the Bard , who drank bottle and bottle about with them , and seemed quite disposed to take up the conqueror when the day dawned . ]</p>

    <head>FOR</head>
    <head>JAMES , EARL OF GLENCAIRN .</head>
    <note>Burns lamented the death of this kind and accomplished nobleman with melancholy sincerity : he moreover named one of his sons for him : he went into mourning when he heard of his death , and he sung of his merits in a strain not destined soon to lose the place it has taken among the verses which record the names of the noble and the generous . He died January 30 , 1791 , in the forty-second year of his age . James Cunningham was succeeded in his title by his brother , and with him expired , in 1796 , the last of a race , whose name is intimately connected with the History of Scotland , from the days of Malcolm Canmore .</note>

    <head>THE SHADE OF THOMSON ,</head>
    <head>ON CROWNING HIS BUST AT EDNAM WITH BAYS .</head>
    <head>[ “ Lord Buchan has the pleasure to invite Mr. Burns to make one at the coronation of the bust of Thomson , on Ednam Hill , on the 22d of September : for which day perhaps his muse may inspire an ode suited to the occasion . Suppose Mr. Burns should , leaving the Nith , go across the country , and meet the Tweed at the nearest point from his farm , and , wandering along the pastoral banks of Thomson 's pure parent stream , catch inspiration in the devious walk , till he finds Lord Buchan sitting on the ruins of Dryburgh . There the Commendator will give him a hearty welcome , and try to light his lamp at the pure flame of native genius , upon the altar of Caledonian virtue . ” Such was the invitation of the Earl of Buchan to Burns . To request the poet to lay down his sickle when his harvest was half reaped , and traverse one of the wildest and most untrodden ways in Scotland , for the purpose of looking at the fantastic coronation of the bad bust of on excellent poet , was worthy of Lord Buchan . The poor bard made answer , that a week 's absence in the middle of his harvest was a step he durst not venture upon — but he sent this Poem .</head>

    <note>By this Poem Burns prepared the way for his humble request to be removed to a district more moderate in its bounds than one which extended over ten country parishes , and exposed him both to fatigue and expense .

    <head>A VISION .</head>
    <note>This Vision of Liberty descended on Burns among the magnificent ruins of the College of Lincluden , which stand on the junction of the Cluden and the Nith , a short mile above Dumfries . He gave us the Vision ; perhaps , he dared not in those yeasty times venture on the song , which his secret visitant poured from her lips . The scene is chiefly copied from nature : the swellings of the Nith , the howling of the fox on the hill , and the cry of the owl , unite at times with the natural beauty of the spot , and give it life and voice . These ruins were a favourite haunt of the poet .</note>

    <head>JOHN MAXWELL OF TERRAUGHTY ,</head>
    <head>ON HIS BIRTHDAY .</head>
    <note>John Maxwell of Terraughty and Munshes , to whom these verses are addressed , though descended from the Earls of Nithsdale , cared little about lineage , and claimed merit only from a judgment sound and clear — a knowledge of business which penetrated into all the concerns of life , and a skill in handling the most difficult subjects , which was considered unrivalled . Under an austere manner , he hid much kindness of heart , and was in a fair way of doing an act of gentleness when giving a refusal . He loved to meet Burns : not that he either cared for or comprehended poetry ; but he was pleased with his knowledge of human nature , and with the keen and piercing remarks in which he indulged . He was seventy-one years old when these verses were written , and survived the poet twenty years .</note>

   <p>[ Miss Fontenelle was one of the actresses whom Williamson , the manager , brought for several seasons to Dumfries : she was young and pretty , indulged in little levities of speech , and rumour added , perhaps maliciously , levities of action . The Rights of Man had been advocated by Paine , the Rights of Woman by Mary Wolstonecroft , and nought was talked of , but the moral and political regeneration of the world . The line</p>
   <p>“ But truce with kings and truce with constitutions , ”</p>

    <head>MONODY ,</head>
    <head>ON A LADY FAMED FOR HER CAPRICE .</head>
    <note>The heroine Of this rough lampoon was Mrs. Riddel of Woodleigh Park : a lady young and gay , much of a wit , and something of a poetess , and till the hour of his death the friend of Burns himself . She pulled his displeasure on her , it is said , by smiling more sweetly than he liked on some “ epauletted coxcombs , ” for so he sometimes designated commissioned officers : the lady soon laughed him out of his mood . We owe to her pen an account of her last interview with the poet , written with great beauty and feeling .</note>

    <head>[ Williamson , the actor , Colonel Macdouall , Captain Gillespie , and Mrs. Riddel , are the characters which pass over the stage in this strange composition : it is printed from the Poet 's own manuscript , and seems a sort of outpouring of wrath and contempt , on persons who , in his eyes , gave themselves airs beyond their condition , or their merits .

    <p>POEM</p>
    <p>ON PASTORAL POETRY .</p>
    <note>Though Gilbert Burns says there is some doubt of this Poem being by his brother , and though Robert Chambers declares that he “ has scarcely a doubt that it is not by the Ayrshire Bard , ” I must print it as his , for I have no doubt on the subject . It was found among the papers of the poet , in his own handwriting : the second , the fourth , and the concluding verses bear the Burns ’ stamp , which no one has been successful in counterfeiting : they resemble the verses of Beattie , to which Chambers has compared them , as little as the cry of the eagle resembles the chirp of the wren .</note>

    <head>APRIL , 1794 .</head>
    <note>The death of Glencairn , who was his patron , and the death of Glenriddel , who was his friend , and had , while he lived at Ellisland , been his neighbor , weighed hard on the mind of Burns , who , about this time , began to regard his own future fortune with more of dismay than of hope . Riddel united antiquarian pursuits with those of literature , and experienced all the vulgar prejudices entertained by the peasantry against those who indulge in such researches . His collection of what the rustics of the vale called “ queer quairns and swine-troughs , ” is now scattered or neglected : I have heard a competent judge say , that they threw light on both the public and domestic history of Scotland .</note>

   <p>THE HERON BALLADS .</p>
   <p>[ BALLAD SECOND . ]</p>
   <note>In this ballad the poet gathers together , after the manner of “ Fy ! let us a ’ to the bridal , ” all the leading electors of the Stewartry , who befriended Heron , or opposed him ; and draws their portraits in the colours of light or darkness , according to the complexion of their politics . He is too severe in most instances , and in some he is venomous . On the Earl of Galloway 's family , and on the Murrays of Broughton and Caillie , as well as on Bushby of Tinwaldowns , he pours his hottest satire . But words which are unjust , or undeserved , fall off their victims like rain-drops from a wild-duck 's wing . The Murrays of Broughton and Caillie have long borne , from the vulgar , the stigma of treachery to the cause of Prince Charles Stewart : from such infamy the family is wholly free : the traitor , Murray , was of a race now extinct ; and while he was betraying the cause in which so much noble and gallant blood was shed , Murray of Broughton and Caillie was performing the duties of an honourable and loyal man : he was , like his great-grandson now , representing his native district in parliament .</note>

   <note>This third and last ballad was written on the contest between Heron and Stewart , which followed close on that with Gordon . Heron carried the election , but was unseated by the decision of a Committee of the House of Commons : a decision which it is said he took so much to heart that it affected his health , and shortened his life .</note>

    <note>This is supposed to be the last Poem written by the hand , or conceived by the muse of Burns .

He was rough and austere , and thought the science of war the noblest of all sciences : he affected a taste for literature , and wrote verses .</note>

    <head>PRAYER FOR ADAM ARMOUR .</head>
    <note>The origin of this prayer is curious . In 1785 , the maid-servant of an innkeeper at Mauchline , having been caught in what old ballad-makers delicately call “ the deed of shame , ” Adam Armour , the brother of the poet 's bonnie Jean , with one or two more of his comrades , executed a rustic act of justice upon her , by parading her perforce through the village , placed on a rough , unpruned piece of wood : an unpleasant ceremony , vulgarly called “ Riding the Stang . ” This was resented by Geordie and Nanse , the girl 's master and mistress ; law was restored to , and as Adam had to hide till the matter was settled , he durst not venture home till late on the Saturday nights . In one of these home-comings he met Burns who laughed when he heard the story , and said , “ You have need of some one to pray for you . ” “ No one can do that better than yourself , ” was the reply , and this humorous intercession was made on the instant , and , as it is said , “ clean off loof . ” From Adam Armour I obtained the verses , and when he wrote them out , he told the story in which the prayer originated .</note>

   <note>Miss Alexander , of Ballochmyle , as the poet tells her in a letter , dated November , 1786 , inspired this popular song . He chanced to meet her in one of his favourite walks on the banks of the Ayr , and the fine scene and the lovely lady set the muse to work . Miss Alexander , perhaps unaccustomed to this forward wooing of the muse , allowed the offering to remain unnoticed for a time : it is now in a costly frame , and hung in her chamber — as it deserves to be .</note>

   <note>This is one of several fine songs in honour of Jean Lorimer , of Kemmis-hall , Kirkmahoe , who for some time lived on the banks of the Craigie-burn , near Moffat . It was composed in aid of the eloquence of a Mr. Gillespie , who was in love with her : but it did not prevail , for she married an officer of the name of Whelpdale , lived with him for a month or so : reasons arose on both sides which rendered separation necessary ; she then took up her residence in Dumfries , where she had many opportunities of seeing the poet . She lived till lately .</note>

I , however , as it happens , did not claim the song wholly for the poet : I said “ the idea of the song is old , and perhaps some of the words . ” It was sent by Burns to the Museum , and in his own handwriting .</note>

Burns recommended this song to Thomson ; and one of his editors makes him say , “ I think this is one of the best love-songs I ever composed , ” but these are not the words of Burns ; this contradiction is made openly , lest it should be thought that the bard had the bad taste to prefer this strain to dozens of others more simple , more impassioned , and more natural .</note>

    <note>“ In my very early years , ” says Burns to Thomson “ when I was thinking of going to the West Indies , I took the following farewell of a dear girl . You must know that all my earlier love-songs were the breathings of ardent passion , and though it might have been easy in after times to have given them a polish , yet that polish , to me , would have defaced the legend of my heart , so faithfully inscribed on them . Their uncouth simplicity was , as they say of wines , their race . ” The heroine of this early composition was Highland Mary .</note>

   </lg>
   <note>Mary Campbell , of whose worth and beauty Burns has sung with such deep feeling , was the daughter of a mariner , who lived in Greenock . She became acquainted with the poet while on service at the castle of Montgomery , and their strolls in the woods and their roaming trysts only served to deepen and settle their affections . Their love had much of the solemn as well as of the romantic : on the day of their separation they plighted their mutual faith by the exchange of Bibles : they stood with a running-stream between them , and lifting up water in their hands vowed love while woods grew and waters ran . The Bible which the poet gave was elegantly bound : ‘ Ye shall not swear by my name falsely , ’ was written in the bold Mauchline hand of Burns , and underneath was his name , and his mark as a freemason . They parted to meet no more : Mary Campbell was carried off suddenly by a burning fever , and the first intimation which the poet had of her fate , was when , it is said , he visited her friends to meet her on her return from Cowal , whither she had gone to make arrangements for her marriage . The Bible is in the keeping of her relations : we have seen a lock of her hair ; it was very long and very bright , and of a hue deeper than the flaxen . The song was written for Thomson 's work .</note>

    <head>LOGAN WATER .</head>
    <note>“ Have you ever , my dear sir , ” says Burns to Thomson , 25th June , 1793 , “ felt your bosom ready to burst with indignation on reading of those mighty villains who divide kingdom against kingdom , desolate provinces , and lay nations waste , out of wantoness of ambition , or often from still more ignoble passions ? In a mood of this kind to-day I recollected the air of Logan Water . If I have done anything at all like justice to my feelings , the following song , composed in three-quarters of an hour 's meditation in my elbow-chair , ought to have some merit . ” The poet had in mind , too , during this poetic fit , the beautiful song of Logan-braes , by my friend John Mayne , a Nithsdale poet .</note>

   <note>There are snatches of old song so exquisitely fine that , like fractured crystal , they cannot be mended or eked out , without showing where the hand of the restorer has been . This seems the case with the first verse of this song , which the poet found in Witherspoon , and completed by the addition of the second verse , which he felt to be inferior , by desiring Thomson to make his own the first verse , and let the other follow , which would conclude the strain with a thought as beautiful as it was original .</note>

    <head>[ Jean M'Murdo , the heroine of this song , the eldest daughter of John M'Murdo of Drumlanrig , was , both in merit and look , very worthy of so sweet a strain , and justified the poet from the charge made against him in the West , that his beauties were not other men 's beauties . In the M'Murdo manuscript , in Burns 's handwriting , there is a well-merited compliment which has slipt out of the printed copy in Thomson :—</head>

    <note>“ Bravo ! say I , ” exclaimed Burns , when he wrote these verses for Thomson . “ It is a good song . Should you think so too , not else , you can set the music to it , and let the other follow as English verses . Autumn is my propitious season ; I make more verses in it than all the year else . ” The old song of “ O my love Annie 's very bonnie , ” helped the muse of Burns with this lyric .</note>

    <head>O WHISTLE , AND I 'LL COME TO YOU .</head>
    <head>[ In one of the variations of this song the name of the heroine is Jeanie : the song itself owes some of the sentiments as well as words to an old favourite Nithsdale chant of the same name . “ Is Whistle , and I 'll come to you , my lad , ” Burns inquires of Thomson , “ one of your airs ? I admire it much , and yesterday I set the following verses to it . ” The poet , two years afterwards , altered the fourth line thus :—</head>
     <l n="1">“ Thy Jeany will venture wi ’ ye , my lad , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>and assigned this reason : “ In fact , a fair dame at whose shrine I , the priest of the Nine , offer up the incense of Parnassus ; a dame whom the Graces have attired in witchcraft , and whom the Loves have armed with lightning ; a fair one , herself the heroine of the song , insists on the amendment , and dispute her commands if you dare . ” ]</p>

    <head>DAINTY DAVIE .</head>
    <note>From the old song of “ Daintie Davie ” Burns has borrowed only the title and the measure . The ancient strain records how the Rev . David Williamson , to escape the pursuit of the dragoons , in the time of the persecution , was hid , by the devout Lady of Cherrytrees , in the same bed with her ailing daughter . The divine lived to have six wives beside the daughter of the Lady of Cherrytrees , and other children besides the one which his hiding from the dragoons produced . When Charles the Second was told of the adventure and its upshot , he is said to have exclaimed , “ God 's fish ! that beats me and the oak : the man ought to be made a bishop . ”</note>

    <head>[ FIRST VERSION . ]</head>
     <l n="1">Tune — “ Hey , tuttie taitie . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <note>Syme of Ryedale states that this fine ode was composed during a storm of rain and fire , among the wilds of Glenken in Galloway : the poet himself gives an account much less romantic . In speaking of the air to Thomson , he says , “ There is a tradition which I have met with in many places in Scotland , that it was Robert Bruce 's march at the battle of Bannockburn . This thought , in my solitary wanderings , warmed me to a pitch of enthusiasm on the theme of liberty and independence , which I threw into a kind of Scottish ode , fitted to the air , that one might suppose to be the royal Scot 's address to his heroic followers on that eventful morning . ” It was written in September , 1793 .</note>

    <head>ROBERT BRUCE 'S ADDRESS TO HIS ARMY .</head>
    <head>[ SECOND VERSION . ]</head>
    <head>[ Thomson acknowledged the charm which this martial and national ode had for him , but he disliked the air , and proposed to substitute that of Lewis Gordon in its place . But Lewis Gordon required a couple of syllables more in every fourth line , which loaded the verse with expletives , and weakened the simple energy of the original : Burns consented to the proper alterations , after a slight resistance ; but when Thomson , having succeeded in this , proposed a change in the expression , no warrior of Bruce 's day ever resisted more sternly the march of a Southron over the border . “ The only line , ” says the musician , “ which I dislike in the whole song is ,</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Welcome to your gory bed : ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>gory presents a disagreeable image to the mind , and a prudent general would avoid saying anything to his soldiers which might tend to make death more frightful than it is . ” “ My ode , ” replied Burns , “ pleases me so much that I cannot alter it : your proposed alterations would , in my opinion , make it tame . ” Thomson cries out , like the timid wife of Coriolanus , “ Oh , God , no blood ! ” while Burns exclaims , like that Roman 's heroic mother , “ Yes , blood ! it becomes a soldier more than gilt his trophy . ” The ode as originally written was restored afterwards in Thomson 's collection . ]</p>

There is an old song and tune which has often thrilled through my soul : I shall give you the verses on the other sheet . Light be the turf on the breast of the heaven-inspired poet who composed this glorious fragment . ” “ The following song , ” says the poet , when he communicated it to George Thomson , “ an old song of the olden times , and which has never been in print , nor even in manuscript , until I took it down from an old man 's singing , is enough to recommend any air . ” These are strong words , but there can be no doubt that , save for a line or two , we owe the song to no other minstrel than “ minstrel Burns . ”</note>

   <note>“ The last evening , ” 29th of August , 1794 , “ as I was straying out , ” says Burns , “ and thinking of ‘ O'er the hills and far away , ’ I spun the following stanzas for it . I was pleased with several lines at first , but I own now that it appears rather a flimsy business . I give you leave to abuse this song , but do it in the spirit of Christian meekness . ”</note>

The origin of this song may be found in Ramsay 's miscellany : the bombast is abated , and the whole much improved .</note>

   <note>“ Conjugal love , ” says the poet , “ is a passion which I deeply feel and highly venerate : but somehow it does not make such a figure in poesie as that other species of the passion , where love is liberty and nature law . Musically speaking , the first is an instrument of which the gamut is scanty and confined , but the tones inexpressibly sweet , while the last has powers equal to all the intellectual modulations of the human soul . ” It must be owned that the bard could render very pretty reasons for his rapture about Jean Lorimer .</note>

   <note>When Burns transcribed the following song for Thomson , on the 20th of November , 1794 , he added , “ Well ! I think this , to be done in two or three turns across my room , and with two or three pinches of Irish blackguard , is not so far amiss . You see I am resolved to have my quantum of applause from somebody . ” The poet in this song complains of the coldness of Mrs. Riddel : the lady replied in a strain equally tender and forgiving .</note>

   <note>“ This song , ” says Sir Harris Nicolas , “ is said , in Thomson 's collection , to have been written for that work by Burns : but it is not included in Mr. Cunningham 's edition . ” If sir Harris would be so good as to look at page 245 ; vol . V ., of Cunningham 's edition of Burns , he will find the song ; and if he will look at page 28 , and page 193 of vol . III ., of his own edition , he will find that he has not committed the error of which he accuses his fellow-editor , for he has inserted the same song twice . The same may be said of the song to Chloris , which Sir Harris has printed at page 312 , vol . II ,. and at page 189 , vol . III ., and of “ Ae day a braw wooer came down the lang glen , ” which appears both at page 224 of vol . II ., and at page 183 of vol , III .</note>

    <note>This was written by Burns in his twenty-third year , when learning flax-dressing in Irvine , and is the earliest of his letters which has reached us .

    <head>HONOURED SIR ,</head>
    <head>I have purposely delayed writing in the hope that I should have the pleasure of seeing you on New-Year 's day ; but work comes so hard upon us , that I do not choose to be absent on that account , as well as for some other little reasons which I shall tell you at meeting . My health is nearly the same as when you were here , only my sleep is a little sounder , and on the whole I am rather better than otherwise , though I mend by very slow degrees . The weakness of my nerves has so debilitated my mind , that I dare neither review past wants , nor look forward into futurity ; for the least anxiety or perturbation in my breast produces most unhappy effects on my whole frame . Sometimes , indeed , when for an hour or two my spirits are alightened , I glimmer a little into futurity ; but my principal , and indeed my only pleasurable employment is looking backwards and forwards in a moral and religious way ; I am quite transported at the thought , that ere long , perhaps very soon , I shall bid an eternal adieu to all the pains , and uneasiness , and disquietudes of this weary life : for I assure you I am heartily tired of it ; and if I do not very much deceive myself , I could contentedly and gladly resign it .</head>
     <l n="1">“ The soul , uneasy , and confined at home ,</l>
     <l n="2">Rests and expatiates in a life to come . "[ 141 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is for this reason I am more pleased with the 15th , 16th , and 17th verses of the 7th chapter of Revelations , than with any ten times as many verses in the whole Bible , and would not exchange the noble enthusiasm with which they inspire me for all that this world has to offer . As for this world , I despair of ever making a figure in it . I am not formed for the bustle of the busy , nor the flutter of the gay . I shall never again be capable of entering into such scenes . Indeed I am altogether unconcerned at the thoughts of this life . I foresee that poverty and obscurity probably await me , and I am in some measure prepared , and daily preparing to meet them . I have but just time and paper to return you my grateful thanks for the lessons of virtue and piety you have given me , which were too much neglected at the time of giving them , but which I hope have been remembered ere it is yet too late . Present my dutiful respects to my mother , and my compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Muir ; and with wishing you a merry New-Year 's day , I shall conclude . I am , honoured sir , your dutiful son ,</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>As I have an opportunity of sending you a letter without putting you to that expense which any production of mine would but ill repay , I embrace it with pleasure , to tell you that I have not forgotten , nor ever will forget , the many obligations I lie under to your kindness and friendship .</p>
   <p>I do not doubt , Sir , but you will wish to know what has been the result of all the pains of an indulgent father , and a masterly teacher ; and I wish I could gratify your curiosity with such a recital as you would be pleased with ; but that is what I am afraid will not be the case . I have , indeed , kept pretty clear of vicious habits ; and , in this respect , I hope , my conduct will not disgrace the education I have gotten ; but , as a man of the world , I am most miserably deficient . One would have thought that , bred as I have been , under a father , who has figured pretty well as un homme des affaires , I might have been , what the world calls , a pushing , active fellow ; but to tell you the truth , Sir , there is hardly anything more my reverse . I seem to be one sent into the world to see and observe ; and I very easily compound with the knave who tricks me of my money , if there be anything original about him , which shows me human nature in a different light from anything I have seen before . In short , the joy of my heart is to “ study men , their manners , and their ways ; ” and for this darling subject , I cheerfully sacrifice every other consideration . I am quite indolent about those great concerns that set the bustling , busy sons of care agog ; and if I have to answer for the present hour , I am very easy with regard to anything further . Even the last , worst shift of the unfortunate and the wretched , does not much terrify me : I know that even then , my talent for what country folks call a “ sensible crack , ” when once it is sanctified by a hoary head , would procure me so much esteem , that even then — I would learn to be happy .<span corresp="#note142" type="note_anchor">[ 142 ]</span>However , I am under no apprehensions about that ; for though indolent , yet so far as an extremely delicate constitution permits , I am not lazy ; and in many things , expecially in tavern matters , I am a strict economist ; not , indeed , for the sake of the money ; but one of the principal parts in my composition is a kind of pride of stomach ; and I scorn to fear the face of any man living : above everything , I abhor as hell , the idea of sneaking in a corner to avoid a dun — possibly some pitiful , sordid wretch , who in my heart I despise and detest . ‘ Tis this , and this alone , that endears economy to me . In the matter of books , indeed , I am very profuse . My favourite authors are of the sentimental kind , such as Shenstone , particularly his “ Elegies ; ” Thomson ; “ Man of Feeling ” — a book I prize next to the Bible ; “ Man of the World ; ” Sterne , especially his “ Sentimental Journey ; ” Macpherson 's “ Ossian , ” &amp; c .; these are the glorious models after which I endeavour to form my conduct , and ‘ tis incongruous , ‘ tis absurd to suppose that the man whose mind glows with sentiments lighted up at their sacred flame — the man whose heart distends with benevolence to all the human race — he “ who can soar above this little scene of things ” — can he descend to mind the paltry concerns about which the terræfilial race fret , and fume , and vex themselves ! O how the glorious triumph swells my heart ! I forget that I am a poor , insignificant devil , unnoticed and unknown , stalking up and down fairs and markets , when I happen to be in them , reading a page or two of mankind , and “ catching the manners living as they rise , ” whilst the men of business jostle me on every side , as an idle encumbrance in their way .— But I dare say I have by this time tired your patience ; so I shall conclude with begging you to give Mrs. Murdoch — not my compliments , for that is a mere common-place story ; but my warmest , kindest wishes for her welfare ; and accept of the same for yourself , from ,</p>
   <p>Dear Sir , yours .— R . B .</p>

    <p>TO MR. JAMES BURNESS ,</p>

    <note>James Burness , son of the poet 's uncle , lives at Montrose , and , as may be surmised , is now very old : fame has come to his house through his eminent cousin Robert , and dearer still through his own grandson , Sir Alexander Burnes , with whose talents and intrepidity the world is well acquainted .</note>
     <l n="1">Lochlea , 21st June , 1783 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>My father received your favour of the 10th current , and as he has been for some months very poorly in health , and is in his own opinion ( and indeed , in almost everybody 's else ) in a dying condition , he has only , with great difficulty , written a few farewell lines to each of his brothers-in-law . For this melancholy reason , I now hold the pen for him to thank you for your kind letter , and to assure you , Sir , that it shall not be my fault if my father 's correspondence in the north die with him . My brother writes to John Caird , and to him I must refer you for the news of our family .</p>
   <p>I shall only trouble you with a few particulars relative to the wretched state of this country . Our markets are exceedingly high ; oatmeal 17d . and 18d . per peck , and not to be gotten even at that price . We have indeed been pretty well supplied with quantities of white peas from England and elsewhere , but that resource is likely to fail us , and what will become of us then , particularly the very poorest sort , Heaven only knows . This country , till of late , was flourishing incredibly in the manufacture of silk , lawn , and carpet-weaving ; and we are still carrying on a good deal in that way , but much reduced from what it was . We had also a fine trade in the shoe way , but now entirely ruined , and hundreds driven to a starving condition on account of it . Farming is also at a very low ebb with us . Our lands , generally speaking , are mountainous and barren ; and our landholders , full of ideas of farming gathered from the English and the Lothians , and other rich soils in Scotland , make no allowance for the odds of the quality of land , and consequently stretch us much beyond what in the event we will be found able to pay . We are also much at a loss for want of proper methods in our improvements of farming . Necessity compels us to leave our old schemes , and few of us have opportunities of being well informed in new ones . In short , my dear Sir , since the unfortunate beginning of this American war , and its as unfortunate conclusion , this country has been , and still is , decaying very fast . Even in higher life , a couple of our Ayrshire noblemen , and the major part of our knights and squires , are all insolvent . A miserable job of a Douglas , Heron , and Co .' s bank , which no doubt you heard of , has undone numbers of them ; and imitating English and French , and other foreign luxuries and fopperies , has ruined as many more . There is a great trade of smuggling carried on along our coasts , which , however destructive to the interests of the kingdom at large , certainly enriches this corner of it , but too often at the expense of our morals . However , it enables individuals to make , at least for a time , a splendid appearance ; but Fortune , as is usual with her when she is uncommonly lavish of her favours , is generally even with them at the last ; and happy were it for numbers of them if she would leave them no worse than when she found them .</p>
   <p>My mother sends you a small present of a cheese , ‘ tis but a very little one , as our last year 's stock is sold off ; but if you could fix on any correspondent in Edinburgh or Glasgow , we would send you a proper one in the season . Mrs. Black promises to take the cheese under her care so far , and then to send it to you by the Stirling carrier .</p>
   <p>I shall conclude this long letter with assuring you that I shall be very happy to hear from you , or any of our friends in your country , when opportunity serves .</p>
   <p>My father sends you , probably for the last time in this world , his warmest wishes for your welfare and happiness ; and my mother and the rest of the family desire to enclose their kind compliments to you , Mrs. Burness , and the rest of your family , along with those of ,</p>
   <p>Dear Sir ,</p>

    <head>TO MISS E .</head>
    <note>The name of the lady to whom this and the three succeeding letters were addressed , seems to have been known to Dr. Currie , who introduced them in his first edition , but excluded them from his second . They were restored by Gilbert Burns , without naming the lady .</note>

   <p>I verily believe , my dear E ., that the pure , genuine feelings of love are as rare in the world as the pure genuine principles of virtue and piety . This I hope will account for the uncommon style of all my letters to you . By uncommon , I mean their being written in such a serious manner , which , to tell you the truth , has made me often afraid lest you should take me for some zealous bigot , who conversed with his mistress as he would converse with his minister . I do n't know how it is , my dear , for though , except your company , there is nothing on earth gives me much pleasure as writing to you , yet it never gives me those giddy raptures so much talked of among lovers . I have often thought that if a well-grounded affection be not really a part of virtue , ‘ tis something extremely akin to it . Whenever the thought of my E. warms my heart , every feeling of humanity , every principle of generosity kindles in my breast . It extinguishes every dirty spark of malice and envy which are but too apt to infest me . I grasp every creature in the arms of universal benevolence , and equally participate in the pleasures of the happy , and sympathize with the miseries of the unfortunate . I assure you , my dear , I often look up to the Divine Disposer of events with an eye of gratitude for the blessing which I hope he intends to bestow on me in bestowing you . I sincerely wish that he may bless my endeavors to make your life as comfortable and happy as possible , both in sweetening the rougher parts of my natural temper , and bettering the unkindly circumstances of my fortune . This , my dear , is a passion , at least in my view , worthy of a man , and I will add worthy of a Christian . The sordid earth-worm may profess love to a woman 's person , whilst in reality his affection is centred in her pocket ; and the slavish drudge may go a-wooing as he goes to the horse-market to choose one who is stout and firm , and as we may say of an old horse , one who will be a good drudge and draw kindly . I disdain their dirty , puny ideas . I would be heartily out of humour with myself if I thought I were capable of having so poor a notion of the sex , which were designed to crown the pleasures of society . Poor devils ! I do n't envy them their happiness who have such notions . For my part , I propose quite other pleasures with my dear partner .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR E .:</p>
   <p>I do not remember , in the course of your acquaintance and mine , ever to have heard your opinion on the ordinary way of falling in love , amongst people of our station of life : I do not mean the persons who proceed in the way of bargain , but those whose affection is really placed on the person .</p>
   <p>Though I be , as you know very well , but a very awkward lover myself , yet as I have some opportunities of observing the conduct of others who are much better skilled in the affair of courtship than I am , I often think it is owing to lucky chance more than to good management , that there are not more unhappy marriages than usually are .</p>
   <p>It is natural for a young fellow to like the acquaintance of the females , and customary for him to keep them company when occasion serves : some one of them is more agreeable to him than the rest ; there is something , he knows not what , pleases him , he knows not how , in her company . This I take to be what is called love with the greater part of us ; and I must own , dear E ., it is a hard game , such a one as you have to play when you meet with such a lover . You cannot refuse but he is sincere , and yet though you use him ever so favourably , perhaps in a few months , or at farthest in a year or two , the same unaccountable fancy may make him as distractedly fond of another , whilst you are quite forgot . I am aware that perhaps the next time I have the pleasure of seeing you , you may bid me take my own lesson home , and tell me that the passion I have professed for you is perhaps one of those transient flashes I have been describing ; but I hope , my dear E ., you will do me the justice to believe me , when I assure you that the love I have for you is founded on the sacred principles of virtue and honour , and by consequence so long as you continue possessed of those amiable qualities which first inspired my passion for you , so long must I continue to love you . Believe me , my dear , it is love like this alone which can render the marriage state happy . People may talk of flames and raptures as long as they please , and a warm fancy , with a flow of youthful spirits , may make them feel something like what they describe ; but sure I am the nobler faculties of the mind , with kindred feelings of the heart , can only be the foundation of friendship , and it has always been my opinion that the married life was only friendship in a more exalted degree . If you will be so good as to grant my wishes , and it should please Providence to spare us to the latest periods of life , I can look forward and see that even then , though bent down with wrinkled age ; even then , when all other worldly circumstances will be indifferent to me , I will regard my E. with the tenderest affection , and for this plain reason , because she is still possessed of those noble qualities , improved to a much higher degree , which first inspired my affection for her .</p>

     <l n="1">“ O ! happy state when souls each other draw ,</l>
     <l n="2">When love is liberty and nature law . "[ 144 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I know were I to speak in such a style to many a girl , who thinks herself possessed of no small share of sense , she would think it ridiculous ; but the language of the heart is , my dear E ., the only courtship I shall ever use to you .</p>
   <p>When I look over what I have written , I am sensible it is vastly different from the ordinary style of courtship , but I shall make no apology — I know your good nature will excuse what your goody sense may see amiss .</p>

   <p>I have often thought it a peculiarly unlucky circumstance in love , that though in every other situation in life , telling the truth is not only the safest , but actually by far the easiest way of proceeding , a lover is never under greater difficulty in acting , or more puzzled for expression , than when his passion is sincere , and his intentions are honourable . I do not think that it is very difficult for a person of ordinary capacity to talk of love and fondness , which are not felt , and to make vows of constancy and fidelity , which are never intended to be performed , if he be villain enough to practise such detestable conduct : but to a man whose heart glows with the principles of integrity and truth , and who sincerely loves a woman of amiable person , uncommon refinement of sentiment and purity of manners — to such an one , in such circumstances , I can assure you , my dear , from my own feelings at this present moment , courtship is a task indeed . There is such a number of foreboding fears and distrustful anxieties crowd into my mind when I am in your company , or when I sit down to write to you , that what to speak , or what to write , I am altogether at a loss .</p>
   <p>There is one rule which I have hitherto practised , and which I shall invariably keep with you , and that is honestly to tell you the plain truth . There is something so mean and unmanly in the arts of dissimulation and falsehood , that I am surprised they can be acted by any one in so noble , so generous a passion , as virtuous love . No , my dear E ., I shall never endeavour to gain your favour by such detestable practices . If you will be so good and so generous as to admit me for your partner , your companion , your bosom friend through life , there is nothing on this side of eternity shall give me greater transport ; but I shall never think of purchasing your hand by any arts unworthy of a man , and I will add of a Christian . There is one thing , my dear , which I earnestly request of you , and it is this ; that you would soon either put an end to my hopes by a peremptory refusal , or cure me of my fears by a generous consent .</p>
   <p>It would oblige me much if you would send me a line or two when convenient . I shall only add further that , if a behaviour regulated ( though perhaps but very imperfectly ) by the rules of honour and virtue , if a heart devoted to love and esteem you , and an earnest endeavour to promote your happiness ; if these are qualities you would wish in a friend , in a husband , I hope you shall ever find them in your real friend , and sincere lover .</p>

   <p>I ought , in good manners , to have acknowledged the receipt of your letter before this time , but my heart was so shocked , with the contents of it , that I can scarcely yet collect my thoughts so as to write you on the subject . I will not attempt to describe what I felt on receiving your letter . I read it over and over , again and again , and though it was in the politest language of refusal , still it was peremptory ; “ you were sorry you could not make me a return , but you wish me , ” what without you I never can obtain , “ you wish me all kind of happiness . ” It would be weak and unmanly to say that , without you I never can be happy ; but sure I am , that sharing life with you would have given it a relish , that , wanting you , I can never taste .</p>
   <p>Your uncommon personal advantages , and your superior good sense , do not so much strike me ; these , possibly , in a few instances may be met with in others ; but that amiable goodness , that tender feminine softness , that endearing sweetness of disposition , with all the charming offspring of a warm feeling heart — these I never again expect to meet with , in such a degree , in this world . All these charming qualities , heightened by an education much beyond anything I have ever met in any woman I ever dared to approach , have made an impression on my heart that I do not think the world can ever efface . My imagination had fondly flattered myself with a wish , I dare not say it ever reached a hope , that possibly I might one day call you mine . I had formed the most delightful images , and my fancy fondly brooded over them ; but now I am wretched for the loss of what I really had no right to expect . I must now think no more of you as a mistress ; still I presume to ask to be admitted as a friend . As such I wish to be allowed to wait on you , and as I expect to remove in a few days a little further off , and you , I suppose , will perhaps soon leave this place , I wish to see or hear from you soon ; and if an expression should perhaps escape me , rather too warm for friendship , I hope you will pardon it in , my dear Miss — ( pardon me the dear expression for once ) * * * *</p>

   <p>TO ROBERT RIDDEL , ESQ .</p>
   <p>OF GLENRIDDEL</p>
   <note>These memoranda throw much light on the early days of Burns , and on the history of his mind and compositions . Robert Riddel , of the Friars-Carse , to whom these fragments were sent , was a good man as well as a distinguished antiquary .</note>
   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>On rummaging over some old papers I lighted on a MS. of my early years , in which I had determined to write myself out ; as I was placed by fortune among a class of men to whom my ideas would have been nonsense . I had meant that the book should have lain by me , in the fond hope that some time or other , even after I was no more , my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value . It sets off thus :—</p>
   <p>“ OBSERVATIONS , HINTS , SONGS , SCRAPS OF POETRY , &amp; c ., by ROBERT BURNESS : a man who had little art in making money , and still less in keeping it ; but was , however , a man of some sense , a great deal of honesty , and unbounded good-will to every creature , rational and irrational .— As he was but little indebted to scholastic education , and bred at a plough-tail , his performances must be strongly tinctured with his unpolished , rustic way of life ; but as I believe they are really his own , it may be some entertainment to a curious observer of human nature to see how a ploughman thinks , and feels , under the pressure of love , ambition , anxiety , grief , with the like cares and passions , which , however diversified by the modes and manners of life , operate pretty much alike , I believe , on all the species . ”</p>
   <p>“ There are numbers in the world who do not want sense to make a figure , so much as an opinion of their own abilities to put them upon recording their observations , and allowing them the same importance which they do to those which appear in print . ” — SHENSTONE .</p>

   <p>Notwithstanding all that has been said against love , respecting the folly and weakness it lends a young inexperienced mind into ; still I think it in a great measure deserves the highest encomiums that have been passed upon it . If anything on earth deserves the name of rapture or transport , it is the feelings of green eighteen in the company of the mistress of his heart , when she repays him with an equal return of affection .</p>
   <p>August .</p>
   <p>There is certainly some connexion between love and music , and poetry ; and therefore , I have always thought it a fine touch of nature , that passage in a modern love-composition :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ As towards her cot she jogged along ,</l>
     <l n="2">Her name was frequent in his song . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For my own part I never had the least thought or inclination of turning poet till I got once heartily in love , and then rhyme and song were in a manner the spontaneous language of my heart . The following composition was the first of my performances , and done at an early period of life , when my heart glowed with honest warm simplicity ; unacquainted and uncorrupted with the ways of a wicked world . The performance is indeed , very puerile and silly ; but I am always pleased with it , as it recalls to my mind those happy days when my heart was yet honest , and my tongue was sincere . The subject of it was a young girl who really deserved all the praises I have bestowed on her . I not only had this opinion of her then — but I actually think so still , now that the spell is long since broken , and the enchantment at an end .</p>
   <p>O once I lov 'd a bonnie lass .<span corresp="#note145" type="note_anchor">[ 145 ]</span></p>
   <p>Lest my works should be thought below criticism : or meet with a critic , who , perhaps , will not look on them with so candid and favourable an eye , I am determined to criticise them myself .</p>
   <p>The first distich of the first stanza is quite too much in the flimsy strain of our ordinary street ballads : and , on the other hand , the second distich is too much in the other extreme . The expression is a little awkward , and the sentiment too serious . Stanza the second I am well pleased with ; and I think it conveys a fine idea of that amiable part of the sex — the agreeables ; or what in our Scotch dialect we call a sweet sonsie lass . The third stanza has a little of the flimsy turn in it ; and the third line has rather too serious a cast . The fourth stanza is a very indifferent one ; the first line , is , indeed , all in the strain of the second stanza , but the rest is most expletive . The thoughts in the fifth stanza come finely up to my favourite idea — a sweet sonsie lass : the last line , however , halts a little . The same sentiments are kept up with equal spirit and tenderness in the sixth stanza , but the second and fourth lines ending with short syllables hurt the whole . The seventh stanza has several minute faults ; but I remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion , and to this hour I never recollect it but my heart melts , my blood sallies , at the remembrance .</p>
   <p>September .</p>
   <p>I entirely agree with that judicious philosopher , Mr. Smith , in his excellent Theory of Moral Sentiments , that remorse is the most painful sentiment that can embitter the human bosom . Any ordinary pitch of fortitude may bear up tolerably well under those calamities , in the procurement of which we ourselves have had no hand ; but when our own follies , or crimes , have made us miserable and wretched , to bear up with manly firmness , and at the same time have a proper penitent sense of our misconduct , is a glorious effort of self-command .</p>

   <p>I have often observed , in the course of my experience of human life , that every man , even the worst , has something good about him ; though very often nothing else than a happy temperament of constitution inclining him to this or that virtue . For this reason no man can say in what degree any other person , besides himself , can be , with strict justice , called wicked . Let any , of the strictest character for regularity of conduct among us , examine impartially how many vices he has never been guilty of , not from any care or vigilance , but for want of opportunity , or some accidental circumstance intervening ; how many of the weaknesses of mankind he has escaped , because he was out of the line of such temptation ; and , what often , if not always , weighs more than all the rest , how much he is indebted to the world 's good opinion , because the world does not know all : I say , any man who can thus think , will scan the failings , nay , the faults and crimes , of mankind around him , with a brother 's eye .</p>
   <p>I have often courted the acquaintance of that part of mankind , commonly known by the ordinary phrase of blackguards , sometimes farther than was consistent with the safety of my character ; those who by thoughtless prodigality or headstrong passions , have been driven to ruin . Though disgraced by follies , nay sometimes , stained with guilt , I have yet found among them , in not a few instances , some of the noblest virtues , magnanimity , generosity , disinterested friendship , and even modesty .</p>
   <p>April .</p>
   <p>As I am what the men of the world , if they knew such a man , would call a whimsical mortal , I have various sources of pleasure and enjoyment , which are , in a manner , peculiar to myself , or some here and there such other out-of-the-way person . Such is the peculiar pleasure I take in the season of winter , more than the rest of the year . This , I believe , may be partly owing to my misfortunes giving my mind a melancholy cast : but there is something even in the —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Mighty tempest , and the hoary waste</l>
     <l n="2">Abrupt and deep , stretch 'd o'er the buried earth , ” —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>which raises the mind to a serious sublimity , favourable to everything great and noble . There is scarcely any earthly object gives me more — I do not know if I should call it pleasure — but something which exalts me , something which enraptures me — than to walk in the sheltered side of a wood , or high plantation , in a cloudy winter-day , and hear the stormy wind howling among the trees , and raving over the plain . It is my best season for devotion : my mind is wrapt up in a kind of enthusiasm to Him , who , in the pompous language of the Hebrew bard , “ walks on the wings of the wind . ” In one of these seasons , just after a train of misfortunes , I composed the following :—</p>
   <p>The wintry west extends his blast .<span corresp="#note146" type="note_anchor">[ 146 ]</span></p>
   <p>Shenstone finely observes , that love-verses , writ without any real passion , are the most nauseous of all conceits ; and I have often thought that no man can be a proper critic of love-composition , except he himself , in one or more instances , have been a warm votary of this passion . As I have been all along a miserable dupe to love , and have been led into a thousand weaknesses and follies by it , for that reason I put the more confidence in my critical skill , in distinguishing foppery and conceit from real passion and nature . Whether the following song will stand the test , I will not pretend to say , because it is my own ; only I can say it was , at the time , genuine from the heart :—</p>
   <p>Behind yon hills , where Lugar flows .<span corresp="#note147" type="note_anchor">[ 147 ]</span></p>
   <p>March , 1784 .</p>
   <p>There was a certain period of my life that my spirit was broke by repeated losses and disasters which threatened , and indeed effected , the utter ruin of my fortune . My body , too , was attacked by that most dreadful distemper , a hypochondria , or confirmed melancholy . In this wretched state , the recollection of which makes me shudder , I hung my harp on the willow trees , except in some lucid intervals , in one of which I composed the following :—</p>
   <p>O thou Great Being ! what Thou art .<span corresp="#note148" type="note_anchor">[ 148 ]</span></p>
   <p>April .</p>
   <p>The following song is a wild rhapsody , miserably deficient in versification ; but as the sentiments are the genuine feelings of my heart , for that reason I have a particular pleasure in conning it over .</p>

   <p>I think the whole species of young men may be naturally enough divided into two grand classes , which I shall call the grave and the merry ; though , by the by , these terms do not with propriety enough express my ideas . The grave I shall cast into the usual division of those who are goaded on by the love of money , and those whose darling wish is to make a figure in the world . The merry are the men of pleasure of all denominations ; the jovial lads , who have too much fire and spirit to have any settled rule of action ; but , without much deliberation , follow the strong impulses of nature : the thoughtless , the careless , the indolent — in particular he who , with a happy sweetness of natural temper , and a cheerful vacancy of thought , steals through life — generally , indeed , in poverty and obscurity ; but poverty and obscurity are only evils to him who can sit gravely down and make a repining comparison between his own situation and that of others ; and lastly , to grace the quorum , such are , generally , those whose heads are capable of all the towerings of genius , and whose hearts are warmed with all the delicacy of feeling .</p>
   <p>August .</p>
   <p>The foregoing was to have been an elaborate dissertation on the various species of men ; but as I cannot please myself in the arrangement of my ideas , I must wait till farther experience and nicer observation throw more light on the subject .— In the mean time I shall set down the following fragment , which , as it is the genuine language of my heart , will enable anybody to determine which of the classes I belong to :</p>

   <p>As the grand end of human life is to cultivate an intercourse with that BEING to whom we owe life , with every enjoyment that renders life delightful ; and to maintain an integritive conduct towards our fellow-creatures ; that so , by forming piety and virtue into habit , we may be fit members for that society of the pious and the good , which reason and revelation teach us to expect beyond the grave , I do not see that the turn of mind , and pursuits of such a one as the above verses describe — one who spends the hours and thoughts which the vocations of the day can spare with Ossian , Shakspeare , Thomson , Shenstone , Sterne , &amp; c .; or , as the maggot takes him , a gun , a fiddle , or a song to make or mend ; and at all times some heart'shYpppHeNdear bonnie lass in view — I say I do not see that the turn of mind and pursuits of such an one are in the least more inimical to the sacred interests of piety and virtue , than the even lawful , bustling and straining after the world 's riches and honours : and I do not see but he may gain heaven as well — which , by the by , is no mean consideration — who steals through the vale of life , amusing himself with every little flower that fortune throws in his way , as he , who straining straight forward , and perhaps spattering all about him , gains some of life 's little eminencies , where , after all , he can only see and be seen a little more conspicuously than what , in the pride of his heart , he is apt to term the poor , indolent devil he has left behind him .</p>

   <p>I do n't well know what is the reason of it , but somehow or other , though I am when I have a mind pretty generally beloved , yet I never could get the art of commanding respect .— I imagine it is owing to my being deficient in what Sterne calls “ that understrapping virtue of discretion . ” — I am so apt to a lapsus linguæ , that I sometimes think the character of a certain great man I have read of somewhere is very much apropos to myself — that he was a compound of great talents and great folly .— N.

   <p>However I am pleased with the works of our Scotch poets , particularly the excellent Ramsay , and the still more excellent Fergusson , yet I am hurt to see other places of Scotland , their towns , rivers , woods , haughs , &amp; c ., immortalized in such celebrated performances , while my dear native country , the ancient bailieries of Carrick , Kyle , and Cunningham , famous both in ancient and modern times for a gallant and warlike race of inhabitants ; a country where civil , and particularly religious liberty have ever found their first support , and their last asylum ; a country , the birth-place of many famous philosophers , soldiers , statesman , and the scene of many important events recorded in Scottish history , particularly a great many of the actions of the glorious WALLACE , the SAVIOUR of his country ; yet , we have never had one Scotch poet of any eminence , to make the fertile banks of Irvine , the romantic woodlands and sequestered scenes on Ayr , and the healthy mountainous source and winding sweep of DOON , emulate Tay , Forth , Ettrick , Tweed , &amp; c. This is a complaint I would gladly remedy , but , alas ! I am far unequal to the task , both in native genius and education .

   <p>There is a great irregularity in the old Scotch songs , a redundancy of syllables with respect to that exactness of accent and measure that the English poetry requires , but which glides in , most melodiously , with the respective tunes to which they are set . For instance , the fine old song of “ The Mill , Mill , O ,"[ 153 ] to give it a plain prosaic reading , it halts prodigiously out of measure ; on the other hand , the song set to the same tune in Bremner 's collection of Scotch songs , which begins “ To Fanny fair could I impart , ” &amp; c ., it is most exact measure , and yet , let them both be sung before a real critic , one above the biases of prejudice , but a thorough judge of nature ,— how flat and spiritless will the last appear , how trite , and lamely methodical , compared with the wild warbling cadence , the heart-moving melody of the first !— This is particularly the case with all those airs which end with a hypermetrical syllable . There is a degree of wild irregularity in many of the compositions and fragments which are daily sung to them by my compeers , the common people — a certain happy arrangement of old Scotch syllables , and yet , very frequently , nothing , not even like rhyme or sameness of jingle , at the ends of the lines . This has made me sometimes imagine that perhaps it might be possible for a Scotch poet , with a nice judicious ear , to set compositions to many of our most favourite airs , particularly that class of them mentioned above , independent of rhyme altogether .</p>
   <p>There is a noble sublimity , a heart-melting tenderness , in some of our ancient ballads , which show them to be the work of a masterly hand : and it has often given me many a heart-ache to reflect that such glorious old bards — bards who very probably owed all their talents to native genius , yet have described the exploits of heroes , the pangs of disappointment , and the meltings of love , with such fine strokes of nature — that their very names ( O how mortifying to a bard 's vanity ! ) are now “ buried among the wreck of things which were . ”</p>
   <p>O ye illustrious names unknown ! who could feel so strongly and describe so well : the last , the meanest of the muses ’ train — one who , though far inferior to your flights , yet eyes your path , and with trembling wing would sometimes soar after you — a poor rustic bard unknown , pays this sympathetic pang to your memory ! Some of you tell us , with all the charms of verse , that you have been unfortunate in the world — unfortunate in love : he , too , has felt the loss of his little fortune , the loss of friends , and , worse than all , the loss of the woman he adored . Like you , all his consolation was his muse : she taught him in rustic measures to complain . Happy could he have done it with your strength of imagination and flow of verse ! May the turf lie lightly on your bones ! and may you now enjoy that solace and rest which this world rarely gives to the heart tuned to all the feelings of poesy and love !</p>
   <p>September .</p>
   <p>The following fragment is done something in imitation of the manner of a noble old Scottish piece , called M'Millan ' s Peggy , and sings to the tune of Galla Water .— My Montgomery 's Peggy was my deity for six or eight months . She had been bred ( though , as the world says , without any just pretence for it ) in a style of life rather elegant ; but , as Vanbrugh says in one of his comedies , my “ d —— d star found me out ” there too : for though I began the affair merely in a gaitié de coeur , or , to tell the truth , which will scarcely be believed , a vanity of showing my parts in courtship , particularly my abilities at a billet-doux , which I always piqued myself upon , made me lay siege to her ; and when , as I always do in my foolish gallantries , I had fettered myself into a very warm affection for her , she told me one day , in a flag of truce , that her fortress had been for some time before the rightful property of another ; but , with the greatest friendship and politeness , she offered me every allegiance except actual possession . I found out afterwards that what she told me of a pre-engagement was really true ; but it cost me some heart-aches to get rid of the affair .</p>
   <p>I have even tried to imitate in this extempore thing that irregularity in the rhymes , which , when judiciously done , has such a fine effect on the ear .</p>
   <p>“ Altho ’ my bed were in yon muir . "[ 154 ]</p>
   <p>September .</p>
   <p>There is another fragment in imitation of an old Scotch song , well known among the country ingle-sides .— I cannot tell the name , neither of the song nor the tune , but they are in fine unison with one another .— By the way , these old Scottish airs are so nobly sentimental , that when one would compose to them , to “ south the tune , ” as our Scotch phrase is , over and over , is the readiest way to catch the inspiration , and raise the bard into that glorious enthusiasm so strongly characteristic of our old Scotch poetry . I shall here set down one verse of the piece mentioned above , both to mark the song and tune I mean , and likewise as a debt I owe to the author , as the repeating of that verse has lighted up my flame a thousand times :—</p>

   <p>The above was an extempore , under the pressure of a heavy train of misfortunes , which , indeed , threatened to undo me altogether . It was just at the close of that dreadful period mentioned already , and though the weather has brightened up a little with me , yet there has always been since a tempest brewing round me in the grim sky of futurity , which I pretty plainly see will some time or other , perhaps ere long , overwhelm me , and drive me into some doleful dell , to pine in solitary , squalid wretchedness .— However , as I hope my poor country muse , who , all rustic , awkward , and unpolished as she is , has more charms for me than any other of the pleasures of life beside — as I hope she will not then desert me , I may even then learn to be , if not happy , at least easy , and south a sang to soothe my misery .</p>
   <p>‘ Twas at the same time I set about composing an air in the old Scotch style .— I am not musical scholar enough to prick down my tune properly , so it can never see the light , and perhaps ‘ tis no great matter ; but the following were the verses I composed to suit it :—</p>

   <p>DEAR COUSIN ,</p>
   <p>I would have returned you my thanks for your kind favour of the 13th of December sooner , had it not been that I waited to give you an account of that melancholy event , which , for some time past , we have from day to day expected .</p>
   <p>On the 13th current I lost the best of fathers . Though , to be sure , we have had long warning of the impending stroke ; still the feelings of nature claim their part , and I cannot recollect the tender endearments and parental lessons of the best of friends and ablest of instructors , without feeling what perhaps the calmer dictates of reason would partly condemn .</p>
   <p>I hope my father 's friends in your country will not let their connexion in this place die with him . For my part I shall ever with pleasure — with pride , acknowledge my connexion with those who were allied by the ties of blood and friendship to a man whose memory I shall ever honour and revere .</p>
   <p>I expect , therefore , my dear Sir , you will not neglect any opportunity of letting me hear from you , which will very much oblige ,</p>
   <p>My dear Cousin , yours sincerely ,</p>

    <note>Mrs. Buchan , the forerunner in extravagance and absurdity of Joanna Southcote , after attempting to fix her tent among the hills of the west and the vales of the Nith , finally set up her staff at Auchengibbert-Hill , in Galloway , where she lectured her followers , and held out hopes of their reaching the stars , even in this life . She died early : one or two of her people , as she called them , survived till within these half-dozen years .</note>
     <l n="1">Mossgiel , August , 1784 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We have been surprised with one of the most extraordinary phenomena in the moral world which , I dare say , had happened in the course of this half century . We have had a party of Presbytery relief , as they call themselves , for some time in this country . A pretty thriving society of them has been in the burgh of Irvine for some years past , till about two years ago , a Mrs. Buchan from Glasgow came among them , and began to spread some fanatical notions of religion among them , and , in a short time , made many converts ; and , among others , their preacher , Mr. Whyte , who , upon that account , has been suspended and formally deposed by his brethren . He continued , however , to preach in private to his party , and was supported , both he and their spiritual mother , as they affect to call old Buchan , by the contributions of the rest , several of whom were in good circumstances ; till , in spring last , the populace rose and mobbed Mrs. Buchan , and put her out of the town ; on which all her followers voluntarily quitted the place likewise , and with such precipitation , that many of them never shut their doors behind them ; one left a washing on the green , another a cow bellowing at the crib without food , or anybody to mind her , and after several stages , they are fixed at present in the neighbourhood of Dumfries . Their tenets are a strange jumble of enthusiastic jargon ; among others , she pretends to give them the Holy Ghost by breathing on them , which she does with postures and practices that are scandalously indecent ; they have likewise disposed of all their effects , and hold a community of goods , and live nearly an idle life , carrying on a great farce of pretended devotion in barns and woods , where they lodge and lie all together , and hold likewise a community of women , as it is another of their tenets that they can commit no mortal sin . I am personally acquainted with most of them , and I can assure you the above mentioned are facts .</p>
   <p>This , my dear Sir , is one of the many instances of the folly of leaving the guidance of sound reason and common sense in matters of religion .</p>
   <p>Whenever we neglect or despise these sacred monitors , the whimsical notions of a perturbated brain are taken for the immediate influences of the Deity , and the wildest fanaticism , and the most inconstant absurdities , will meet with abettors and converts . Nay , I have often thought , that the more out-of-the-way and ridiculous the fancies are , if once they are sanctified under the sacred name of religion , the unhappy mistaken votaries are the more firmly glued to them .</p>

   <p>TO MISS ——.</p>
   <note>This has generally been printed among the early letters of Burns . Cromek thinks that the person addressed was the “ Peggy ” of the Common-place Book . This is questioned by Robert Chambers , who , however , leaves both name and date unsettled .</note>
   <p>MY DEAR COUNTRYWOMAN ,</p>
   <p>I am so impatient to show you that I am once more at peace with you , that I send you the book I mentioned directly , rather than wait the uncertain time of my seeing you . I am afraid I have mislaid or lost Collins ’ Poems , which I promised to Miss Irvin . If I can find them , I will forward them by you ; if not , you must apologize for me .</p>
   <p>I know you will laugh at it when I tell you that your piano and you together have played the deuce somehow about my heart . My breast has been widowed these many months , and I thought myself proof against the fascinating witchcraft ; but I am afraid you will “ feelingly convince me what I am . ” I say , I am afraid , because I am not sure what is the matter with me . I have one miserable bad symptom ; when you whisper , or look kindly to another , it gives me a draught of damnation . I have a kind of wayward wish to be with you ten minutes by yourself , though what I would say , Heaven above knows , for I am sure I know not . I have no formed design in all this ; but just , in the nakedness of my heart , write you down a mere matter-of-fact story . You may perhaps give yourself airs of distance on this , and that will completely cure me ; but I wish you would not : just let us meet , if you please , in the old beaten way of friendship .</p>
   <p>I will not subscribe myself your humble servant , for that is a phrase , I think at least fifty miles off from the heart ; but I will conclude with sincerely wishing that the Great Protector of innocence may shield you from the barbed dart of calumny , and hand you by the covert snare of deceit .</p>

Be so good as send me Fergusson , by Connel , and I will remit you the money . I have no news to acquaint you with about Mauchline , they are just going on in the old way . I have some very important news with respect to myself , not the most agreeable — news that I am sure you cannot guess , but I shall give you the particulars another time . I am extremely happy with Smith ; he is the only friend I have now in Mauchline . I can scarcely forgive your long neglect of me , and I beg you will let me hear from you regularly by Connel .

On these accounts , he refuses sending me with Smith , but a vessel sails from Greenock the first of September , right for the place of my destination . The Captain of her is an intimate friend of Mr. Gavin Hamilton 's , and as good a fellow as heart could wish : with him I am destined to go .

   <p>DEAR BRICE ,</p>
   <p>I received your message by G. Patterson , and as I am not very throng at present , I just write to let you know that there is such a worthless , rhyming reprobate , as your humble servant , still in the land of the living , though I can scarcely say , in the place of hope . I have no news to tell you that will give me any pleasure to mention , or you to hear .</p>
   <p>Poor ill-advised ungrateful Armour came home on Friday last . You have heard all the particulars of that affair , and a black affair it is . What she thinks of her conduct now , I do n't know ; one thing I do know — she has made me completely miserable . Never man loved , or rather adored a woman more than I did her ; and , to confess a truth between you and me , I do still love her to distraction after all , though I wo n't tell her so if I were to see her , which I do n't want to do . My poor dear unfortunate Jean ! how happy have I been in thy arms ! It is not the losing her that makes me so unhappy , but for her sake I feel most severely : I foresee she is in the road to , I am afraid , eternal ruin . * * * *</p>
   <p>May Almighty God forgive her ingratitude and perjury to me , as I from my very soul forgive her : and may his grace be with her and bless her in all her future life ! I can have no nearer idea of the place of eternal punishment than what I have felt in my own breast on her account . I have tried often to forget her ; I have run into all kinds of dissipation and riots , mason-meetings , drinking matches , and other mischief , to drive her out of my head , but all in vain . And now for a grand cure ; the ship is on her way home that is to take me out to Jamaica ; and then , farewell dear old Scotland ! and farewell dear ungrateful Jean ! for never never will I see you more .</p>
   <p>You will have heard that I am going to commence poet in print ; and to morrow my works go to the press . I expect it will be a volume of about two hundred pages — it is just the last foolish action I intend to do ; and then turn a wise man as fast as possible .</p>
   <p>Believe me to be , dear Brice ,</p>
   <p>Your friend and well-wisher ,</p>

    <head>TO MR. ROBERT AIKEN .</head>
    <note>This letter was written under great distress of mind . That separation which Burns records in “ The Lament , ” had , unhappily , taken place between him and Jean Armour , and it would appear , that for a time at least a coldness ensued between the poet and the patron , occasioned , it is conjectured , by that fruitful subject of sorrow and disquiet . The letter , I regret to say , is not wholly here .</note>

   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I was with Wilson , my printer , t'other day , and settled all our by-gone matters between us . After I had paid him all demands , I made him the offer of the second edition , on the hazard of being paid out of the first and readiest , which he declines . By his account , the paper of a thousand copies would cost me about twenty-seven pounds , and the printing about fifteen or sixteen : he offers to agree to this for the printing , if I will advance for the paper , but this , you know , is out of my power ; so farewell hopes of a second edition till I grow rich ! an epoch which I think will arrive at the payment of the British national debt .</p>
   <p>There is scarcely anything hurts me so much in being disappointed of my second edition , as not having it in my power to show my gratitude to Mr. Ballantyne , by publishing my poem of “ The Brigs of Ayr . ” I would detest myself as a wretch , if I thought I were capable in a very long life of forgetting the honest , warm , and tender delicacy with which he enters into my interests . I am sometimes pleased with myself in my greateful sensations ; but I believe , on the whole , I have very little merit in it , as my gratitude is not a virtue , the consequence of reflection ; but sheerly the instinctive emotion of my heart , too inattentive to allow worldly maxims and views to settle into selfish habits . I have been feeling all the various rotations and movements within , respecting the excise . There are many things plead strongly against it ; the uncertainty of getting soon into business ; the consequences of my follies , which may perhaps make it impracticable for me to stay at home ; and besides I have for some time been pining under secret wretchedness , from causes which you pretty well know — the pang of disappointment , the sting of pride , with some wandering stabs of remorse , which never fail to settle on my vitals like vultures , when attention is not called away by the calls of society , or the vagaries of the muse . Even in the hour of social mirth , my gayety is the madness of an intoxicated criminal under the hands of the executioner . All these reasons urge me to go abroad , and to all these reasons I have only one answer — the feelings of a father . This , in the present mood I am in , overbalances everything that can be laid in the scale against it . * * * *</p>
   <p>You may perhaps think it an extravagant fancy , but it is a sentiment which strikes home to my very soul : though sceptical in some points of our current belief , yet , I think , I have every evidence for the reality of a life beyond the stinted bourne of our present existence ; if so , then , how should I , in the presence of that tremendous Being , the Author of existence , how should I meet the reproaches of those who stand to me in the dear relation of children , whom I deserted in the smiling innocency of helpless infancy ? O , thou great unknown Power !— thou almighty God ! who has lighted up reason in my breast , and blessed me with immortality !— I have frequently wandered from that order and regularity necessary for the perfection of thy works , yet thou hast never left me nor forsaken me ! * * * *</p>
   <p>Since I wrote the foregoing sheet , I have seen something of the storm of mischief thickening over my folly-devoted head . Should you , my friends , my benefactors , be successful in your applications for me , perhaps it may not be in my power , in that way , to reap the fruit of your friendly efforts . What I have written in the preceding pages , is the settled tenor of my present resolution ; but should inimical circumstances forbid me closing with your kind offer , or enjoying it only threaten to entail farther misery — * * * *</p>
   <p>To tell the truth , I have little reason for complaint ; as the world , in general , has been kind to me fully up to my deserts . I was , for some time past , fast getting into the pining , distrustful snarl of the misanthrope . I saw myself alone , unlit for the struggle of life , shrinking at every rising cloud in the chance-directed atmosphere of fortune , while all defenceless I looked about in vain for a cover . It never occurred to me , at least never with the force it deserved , that this world is a busy scene , and man , a creature destined for a progressive struggle ; and that , however I might possess a warm heart and inoffensive manners ( which last , by the by , was rather more than I could well boast ) ; still , more than these passive qualities , there was something to be done . When all my school-fellows and youthful compeers ( those misguided few excepted who joined , to use a Gentoo phrase , the “ hallachores ” of the human race ) were striking off with eager hope and earnest intent , in some one or other of the many paths of busy life , I was “ standing idle in the market-place , ” or only left the chase of the butterfly from flower to flower , to hunt fancy from whim to whim . * * * *</p>
   <p>You see , Sir , that if to know one 's errors were a probability of mending them , I stand a fair chance ; but according to the reverend Westminster divines , though conviction must precede conversion , it is very far from always implying it . * * * *</p>

    <note>The minister who took upon him to pronounce Burns a single man , as he intimates in this letter , was the Rev . Mr. Auld , of Mauchline : that the law of the land and the law of the church were at variance on the subject no one can deny .</note>
     <l n="1">Mossgiel , 9th July , 1786 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>With the sincerest grief I read your letter . You are truly a son of misfortune . I shall be extremely anxious to hear from you how your health goes on ; if it is in any way re-establishing , or if Leith promises well ; in short , how you feel in the inner man .</p>
   <p>No news worth anything : only godly Bryan was in the inquisition yesterday , and half the country-side as witness against him . He still stands out steady and denying : but proof was led yesternight of circumstances highly suspicious : almost de facto one of the servant girls made faith that she upon a time rashly entered the house — to speak in your cant , “ in the hour of cause . ”</p>
   <p>I have waited on Armour since her return home ; not from any the least view of reconciliation , but merely to ask for her health and — to you I will confess it — from a foolish hankering fondness — very ill placed indeed . The mother forbade me the house , nor did Jean show the penitence that might have been expected . However , the priest , I am informed , will give me a certificate as a single man , if I comply with the rules of the church , which for that very reason I intend to do .</p>
   <p>I am going to put on sack-cloth and ashes this day . I am indulged so far as to appear in my own seat . Peccavi , pater , miserere mei . My book will be ready in a fortnight . If you have any subscribers , return them by Connel . The Lord stand with the righteous : amen , amen .</p>

   <p>TO JOHN BALLANTYNE ,</p>
   <p>OF AYR .</p>
   <note>There is a plain account in this letter of the destruction of the lines of marriage which united , as far as a civil contract in a manner civil can , the poet and Jean Armour . Aiken was consulted , and in consequence of his advice , the certificate of marriage was destroyed .</note>
   <p>HONOURED SIR ,</p>
   <p>My proposals came to hand last night , and knowing that you would wish to have it in your power to do me a service as early as anybody , I enclose you half a sheet of them . I must consult you , first opportunity , on the propriety of sending my quondam friend , Mr. Aiken , a copy . If he is now reconciled to my character as an honest man , I would do it with all my soul ; but I would not be beholden to the noblest being ever God created , if he imagined me to be a rascal . Apropos , old Mr. Armour prevailed with him to mutilate that unlucky paper yesterday . Would you believe it ? though I had not a hope , nor even a wish , to make her mine after her conduct ; yet , when he told me the names were all out of the paper , my heart died within me , and he cut my veins with the news . Perdition seize her falsehood !</p>

    <head>SHOEMAKER , GLASGOW .</head>
    <note>The letters of Burns at the sad period of his life are full of his private sorrows . Had Jean Armour been left to the guidance of her own heart , the story of her early years would have been brighter .</note>
     <l n="1">Mossgiel , 17th July , 1786 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have been so throng printing my Poems , that I could scarcely find as much time as to write to you . Poor Armour is come back again to Mauchline , and I went to call for her , and her mother forbade me the house , nor did she herself express much sorrow for what she has done . I have already appeared publicly in church , and was indulged in the liberty of standing in my own seat . I do this to get a certificate as a bachelor , which Mr. Auld has promised me . I am now fixed to go for the West Indies in October . Jean and her friends insisted much that she should stand along with me in the kirk , but the minister would not allow it , which bred a great trouble I assure you , and I am blamed as the cause of it , though I am sure I am innocent ; but I am very much pleased , for all that , not to have had her company . I have no news to tell you that I remember . I am really happy to hear of your welfare , and that you are so well in Glasgow . I must certainly see you before I leave the country . I shall expect to hear from you soon , and am ,</p>

    <head>MY DEAR RICHMOND ,</head>
    <head>My hour is now come — you and I will never meet in Britain more . I have orders within three weeks at farthest , to repair aboard the Nancy , Captain Smith , from Clyde to Jamaica , and call at Antigua . This , except to our friend Smith , whom God long preserve , is a secret about Mauchline . Would you believe it ? Armour has got a warrant to throw me in jail till I find security for an enormous sum . This they keep an entire secret , but I got it by a channel they little dream of ; and I am wandering from one friend 's house to another , and , like a true son of the gospel , “ have nowhere to lay my head . ” I know you will pour an execration on her head , but spare the poor , ill-advised girl , for my sake ; though may all the furies that rend the injured , enraged lover 's bosom , await her mother until her latest hour ! I write in a moment of rage , reflecting on my miserable situation — exiled , abandoned , forlorn . I can write no more — let me hear from you by the return of coach .

   <p>MY FRIEND , MY BROTHER ,</p>
   <p>Warm recollection of an absent friend presses so hard upon my heart , that I send him the prefixed bagatelle ( the Calf ) , pleased with the thought that it will greet the man of my bosom , and be a kind of distant language of friendship .</p>
   <p>You will have heard that poor Armour has repaid me double . A very fine boy and a girl have awakened a thought and feelings that thrill , some with tender pressure and some with foreboding anguish , through my soul .</p>
   <p>The poem was nearly an extemporaneous production , on a wager with Mr. Hamilton , that I would not produce a poem on the subject in a given time .</p>
   <p>If you think it worth while , read it to Charles and Mr. W. Parker , and if they choose a copy of it , it is at their service , as they are men whose friendship I shall be proud to claim , both in this world and that which is to come .</p>

    <head>I am truly sorry I was not at home yesterday , when I was so much honoured with your order for my copies , and incomparably more by the handsome compliments you are pleased to pay my poetic abilities . I am fully persuaded that there is not any class of mankind so feelingly alive to the titillations of applause as the sons of Parnassus : nor is it easy to conceive how the heart of the poor bard dances with rapture , when those , whose character in life gives them a right to be polite judges , honour him with their approbation .

   <p>The first book I met with in my early years , which I perused with pleasure , was , “ The Life Of Hannibal ; ” the next was , “ The History of Sir William Wallace : ” for several of my earlier years I had few other authors ; and many a solitary hour have I stole out , after the laborious vocations of the day , to shed a tear over their glorious , but unfortunate stories . In those boyish days I remember , in particular , being struck with that part of Wallace 's story where these lines occur —</p>

     <l n="1">“ Syne to the Leglen wood , when it was late ,</l>

   <p>I chose a fine summer Sunday , the only day my line of life allowed , and walked half a dozen of miles to pay my respects to the Leglen wood , with as much devout enthusiasm as ever pilgrim did to Loretto ; and , as I explored every den and dell where I could suppose my heroic countryman to have lodged , I recollect ( for even then I was a rhymer ) that my heart glowed with a wish to be able to make a song on him in some measure equal to his merits .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I this moment receive yours — receive it with the honest hospitable warmth of a friend 's welcome . Whatever comes from you wakens always up the better blood about my heart , which your kind little recollections of my parental friends carries as far as it will go . ‘ Tis there that man is blest ! ‘ Tis there , my friend , man feels a consciousness of something within him above the trodden clod ! The grateful reverence to the hoary ( earthly ) author of his being — the burning glow when he clasps the woman of his soul to his bosom — the tender yearnings of heart for the little angels to whom he has given existence — these nature has poured in milky streams about the human heart ; and the man who never rouses them to action , by the inspiring influences of their proper objects , loses by far the most pleasurable part of his existence .</p>
   <p>My departure is uncertain , but I do not think it will be till after harvest . I will be on very short allowance of time indeed , if I do not comply with your friendly invitation . When it will be I do n't know , but if I can make my wish good , I will endeavour to drop you a line some time before . My best compliments to Mrs. ——; I should [ be ] equally mortified should I drop in when she is abroad , but of that I suppose there is little chance .</p>
   <p>What I have wrote heaven knows ; I have not time to review it ; so accept of it in the beaten way of friendship . With the ordinary phrase — perhaps rather more than the ordinary sincerity ,</p>

    <note>This letter , Robert Chambers says , concluded with requesting Miss Alexander to allow the poet to print the song which it enclosed , in a second edition of his Poems . Her neglect in not replying to this request is a very good poetic reason for his wrath . Many of Burns 's letters have been printed , it is right to say , from the rough drafts found among the poet 's papers at his death . This is one .</note>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Poets are such outré beings , so much the children of wayward fancy and capricious whim , that I believe the world generally allows them a larger latitude in the laws of propriety , than the sober sons of judgment and prudence . I mention this as an apology for the liberties that a nameless stranger has taken with you in the enclosed poem , which he begs leave to present you with . Whether it has poetical merit any way worthy of the theme , I am not the proper judge ; but it is the best my abilities can produce ; and what to a good heart will , perhaps , be a superior grace , it is equally sincere as fervent .</p>
   <p>The scenery was nearly taken from real life , though I dare say , Madam , you do not recollect it , as I believe you scarcely noticed the poetic reveur as he wandered by you . I had roved out as chance directed , in the favourite haunts of my muse on the banks of the Ayr , to view nature in all the gayety of the vernal year . The evening sun was flaming over the distant western hills ; not a breath stirred the crimson opening blossom , or the verdant spreading leaf . It was a golden moment for a poetic heart . I listened to the feathered warblers , pouring their harmony on every hand , with a congenial kindred regard , and frequently turned out of my path , lest I should disturb their little songs , or frighten them to another station . Surely , said I to myself , he must be a wretch indeed , who , regardless of your harmonious endeavour to please him , can eye your elusive flights to discover your secret recesses , and to rob you of all the property nature gives you — your dearest comforts , your helpless nestlings . Even the hoary hawthorn twig that shot across the way , what heart at such a time but must have been interested in its welfare , and wished it preserved from the rudely-browsing cattle , or the withering eastern blast ? Such was the scene ,— and such the hour , when , in a corner of my prospect , I spied one of the fairest pieces of nature 's workmanship that ever crowned a poetic landscape or met a poet 's eye , those visionary bards excepted , who hold commerce with aërial beings ! Had Calumny and Villany taken my walk , they had at that moment sworn eternal peace with such an object .</p>
   <p>What an hour of inspiration for a poet ! It would have raised plain dull historic prose into metaphor measure .</p>
   <p>The enclosed song was the work of my return home : and perhaps it but poorly answers what might have been expected from such a scene .</p>
   <p>I have the honour to be ,</p>

    <head>OF STAIR AND AFTON .</head>
    <note>Mrs. Stewart , of Stair and Afton , was the first person of note in the West who had the taste to see and feel the genius of Burns .

     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 1786 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>The hurry of my preparations for going abroad has hindered me from performing my promise so soon as I intended . I have here sent you a parcel of songs , &amp; c ., which never made their appearance , except to a friend or two at most . Perhaps some of them may be no great entertainment to you , but of that I am far from being an adequate judge . The song to the tune of “ Ettrick Banks ” [ The bonnie lass of Ballochmyle ] you will easily see the impropriety of exposing much , even in manuscript . I think , myself , it has some merit : both as a tolerable description of one of nature 's sweetest scenes , a July evening , and one of the finest pieces of nature 's workmanship , the finest indeed we know anything of , an amiable , beautiful young woman ;<span corresp="#note161" type="note_anchor">[ 161 ]</span>but I have no common friend to procure me that permission , without which I would not dare to spread the copy .</p>
   <p>I am quite aware , Madam , what task the world would assign me in this letter . The obscure bard , when any of the great condescend to take notice of him , should heap the altar with the incense of flattery . Their high ancestry , their own great and godlike qualities and actions , should be recounted with the most exaggerated description . This , Madam , is a task for which I am altogether unfit . Besides a certain disqualifying pride of heart , I know nothing of your connexions in life , and have no access to where your real character is to be found — the company of your compeers : and more , I am afraid that even the most refined adulation is by no means the road to your good opinion .</p>
   <p>One feature of your character I shall ever with grateful pleasure remember ;— the reception I got when I had the honour of waiting on you at Stair . I am little acquainted with politeness , but I know a good deal of benevolence of temper and goodness of heart . Surely did those in exalted stations know how happy they could make some classes of their inferiors by condescension and affability , they would never stand so high , measuring out with every look the height of their elevation , but condescend as sweetly as did Mrs. Stewart of Stair .</p>

   <p>HONOURED SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have paid every attention to your commands , but can only say what perhaps you will have heard before this reach you , that Muirkirklands were bought by a John Gordon , W. S ., but for whom I know not ; Mauchlands , Haugh , Miln , &amp; c ., by a Frederick Fotheringham , supposed to be for Ballochmyle Laird , and Adamhill and Shawood were bought for Oswald 's folks .— This is so imperfect an account , and will be so late ere it reach you , that were it not to discharge my conscience I would not trouble you with it ; but after all my diligence I could make it no sooner nor better .</p>
   <p>For my own affairs , I am in a fair way of becoming as eminent as Thomas à Kempis or John Bunyan ; and you may expect henceforth to see my birth-day inserted among the wonderful events , in the Poor Robin 's and Aberdeen Almanacks , along with the Black Monday , and the battle of Bothwell bridge .— My Lord Glencairn and the Dean of Faculty , Mr. H. Erskine , have taken me under their wing ; and by all probability I shall soon be the tenth worthy , and the eighth wise man in the world . Through my lord 's influence it is inserted in the records of the Caledonian Hunt , that they universally , one and all , subscribe for the second edition .— My subscription bills come out to-morrow , and you shall have some of them next post .— I have met , in Mr. Dalrymple , of Orangefield , what Solomon emphatically calls “ a friend that sticketh closer than a brother . ” — The warmth with which he interests himself in my affairs is of the same enthusiastic kind which you , Mr. Aiken , and the few patrons that took notice of my earlier poetic days , showed for the poor unlucky devil of a poet .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>I confess I have sinned the sin for which there is hardly any forgiveness — ingratitude to friendship — in not writing you sooner ; but of all men living , I had intended to have sent you an entertaining letter ; and by all the plodding , stupid powers , that in nodding , conceited majesty , preside over the dull routine of business — a heavily solemn oath this !— I am , and have been , ever since I came to Edinburgh , as unfit to write a letter of humour , as to write a commentary on the Revelation of St. John the Divine , who was banished to the Isle of Patmos , by the cruel and bloody Domitian , son to Vespasian and brother to Titus , both emperors of Rome , and who was himself an emperor , and raised the second or third persecution , I forget which , against the Christians , and after throwing the said Apostle John , brother to the Apostle James , commonly called James the Greater , to distinguish him from another James , who was , on some account or other , known by the name of James the Less — after throwing him into a cauldron of boiling oil , from which he was miraculously preserved , he banished the poor son of Zebedee to a desert island in the Archipelago , where he was gifted with the second sight , and saw as many wild beasts as I have seen since I came to Edinburgh ; which , a circumstance not very uncommon in story-telling , brings me back to where I set out .</p>
   <p>To make you some amends for what , before you reach this paragraph , you will have suffered , I enclose you two poems I have carded and spun since I past Glenbuck .</p>
   <p>One blank in the address to Edinburgh — “ Fair B ——, ” is heavenly Miss Burnet , daughter to Lord Monboddo , at whose house I have had the honour to be more than once .

   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>As I have but slender pretensions to philosophy , I cannot rise to the exalted ideas of a citizen of the world , but have all those national prejudices , which I believe glow peculiarly strong in the breast of a Scotchman . There is scarcely anything to which I am so feelingly alive as the honour and welfare of my country : and , as a poet , I have no higher enjoyment than singing her sons and daughters . Fate had cast my station in the veriest shades of life ; but never did a heart pant more ardently than mine to be distinguished ; though , till very lately , I looked in vain on every side for a ray of light . It is easy then to guess how much I was gratified with the countenance and approbation of one of my country 's most illustrious sons , when Mr. Wauchope called on me yesterday on the part of your lordship . Your munificence , my lord , certainly deserves my very grateful acknowledgments ; but your patronage is a bounty peculiarly suited to my feelings . I am not master enough of the etiquette of life to know , whether there be not some impropriety in troubling your lordship with my thanks , but my heart whispered me to do it . From the emotions of my inmost soul I do it . Selfish ingratitude I hope I am incapable of ; and mercenary servility , I trust , I shall ever have so much honest pride as to detest .</p>

Mr. Auld was of the same opinion , since he offered him a certificate that he was single : but no opinion of priest or lawyer , including the disclamation of Jean Armour , and the belief of Burns , could have , in my opinion , barred the claim of the children to full legitimacy , according to the law of Scotland .</note>

   </lg>
   <p>MY HONOURED FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>It gives me a secret comfort to observe in myself that I am not yet so far gone as Willie Gaw 's Skate , “ past redemption ; ” for I have still this favourable symptom of grace , that when my conscience , as in the case of this letter , tells me I am leaving something undone that I ought to do , it teases me eternally till I do it .</p>
   <p>I am still “ dark as was Chaos "[ 165 ] in respect to futurity . My generous friend , Mr. Patrick Miller , has been talking with me about a lease of some farm or other in an estate called Dalswinton , which he has lately bought , near Dumfries . Some life-rented embittering recollections whisper me that I will be happier anywhere than in my old neighbourhood , but Mr. Miller is no judge of land ; and though I dare say he means to favour me , yet he may give me , in his opinion , an advantageous bargain that may ruin me . I am to take a tour by Dumfries as I return , and have promised to meet Mr. Miller on his lands some time in May .</p>
   <p>I went to a mason-lodge yesternight , where the most Worshipful Grand Master Charters , and all the Grand Lodge of Scotland visited . The meeting was numerous and elegant ; all the different lodges about town were present , in all their pomp . The Grand Master , who presided with great solemnity and honour to himself as a gentleman and mason , among other general toasts , gave “ Caledonia , and Caledonia 's Bard , Brother Burns , ” which rung through the whole assembly with multiplied honours and repeated acclamations . As I had no idea such a thing would happen , I was downright thunderstruck , and , trembling in every nerve , made the best return in my power . Just as I had finished , some of the grand officers said , so loud that I could hear , with a most comforting accent , “ Very well indeed ! ” which set me something to rights again .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Yours of the 9th current , which I am this moment honoured with , is a deep reproach to me for ungrateful neglect . I will tell you the real truth , for I am miserably awkward at a fib — I wished to have written to Dr. Moore before I wrote to you ; but though every day since I received yours of December 30th , the idea , the wish to write to him has constantly pressed on my thoughts , yet I could not for my soul set about it . I know his fame and character , and I am one of “ the sons of little men . ” To write him a mere matter-of-fact affair , like a merchant 's order , would be disgracing the little character I have ; and to write the author of “ The View of Society and Manners ” a letter of sentiment — I declare every artery runs cold at the thought . I shall try , however , to write to him to-morrow or next day . His kind interposition in my behalf I have already experienced , as a gentleman waited on me the other day , on the part of Lord Eglintoun , with ten guineas , by way of subscription for two copies of my next edition .</p>
   <p>The word you object to in the mention I have made of my glorious countryman and your immortal ancestor , is indeed borrowed from Thomson ; but it does not strike me us an improper epithet . I distrusted my own judgment on your finding fault with it , and applied for the opinion of some of the literati here , who honour me with their critical strictures , and they all allow it to be proper . The song you ask I cannot recollect , and I have not a copy of it . I have not composed anything on the great Wallace , except what you have , seen in print ; and the enclosed , which I will print in this edition . You will see I have mentioned some others of the name . When I composed my “ Vision ” long ago , I had attempted a description of Koyle , of which the additional stanzas are a part , as it originally stood . My heart glows with a wish to be able to do justice to the merits of the “ Saviour of his Country , ” which sooner or later I shall at least attempt .</p>
   <p>You are afraid I shall grow intoxicated with my prosperity as a poet ; alas ! Madam , I know myself and the world too well . I do not mean any airs of affected modesty ; I am willing to believe that my abilities deserve some notice ; but in a most enlightened , informed age and nation , when poetry is and has been the study of man of the first natural genius , aided with all the powers of polite learning , polite books , and polite company — to be dragged forth to the full glare of learned and polite observation , with all my imperfections of awkward rusticity and crude unpolished ideas on my head — I assure you , Madam , I do not dissemble when I tell you I tremble for the consequences . The novelty of a poet in my obscure situation , without any of those advantages which are reckoned necessary for that character , at least at this time of day , has raised a partial tide of public notice which has borne me to a height , where I am absolutely , feelingly certain , my abilities are inadequate to support me ; and too surely do I see that time when the same tide will leave me , and recede , perhaps , as far below the mark of truth . I do not say this in the ridiculous affectation of self-abasement and modesty . I have studied myself , and know what ground I occupy ; and , however a friend or the world may differ from me in that particular , I stand for my own opinion , in silent resolve , with all the tenaciousness of property . I mention this to you once for all to disburthen my mind , and I do not wish to hear or say more about it — But ,</p>
   <p>“ When proud fortune 's ebbing tide recedes , ”</p>
   <p>you will bear me witness , that when my bubble of fame was at the highest , I stood unintoxicated with the inebriating cup in my hand , looking forward with rueful resolve to the hastening time , when the blow of Calumny should dash it to the ground with all the eagerness of vengeful triumph .</p>
   <p>Your patronizing me and interesting yourself in my fame and character as a poet , I rejoice in ; it exalts me in my own idea ; and whether you can or cannot aid me in my subscription is a trifle . Has a paltry subscription-bill any charms to the heart of a bard , compared with the patronage of the descendant of the immortal Wallace ?</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Mrs. Dunlop has been so kind as to send me extracts of letters she has had from you , where you do the rustic bard the honour of noticing him and his works . Those who have felt the anxieties and solicitudes of authorship , can only know what pleasure it gives to be noticed in such a manner , by judges of the first character . Your criticism , Sir , I receive with reverence ; only I am sorry they mostly came too late : a peccant passage or two that I would certainly have altered , were gone to the press .</p>
   <p>The hope to be admired for ages , is , in by far the greater part of those even who are authors of repute , an unsubstantial dream . For my part , my first ambition was , and still my strongest wish is , to please my compeers , the rustic inmates of the hamlet , while ever-changing language and manners shall allow me to be relished and understood . I am very willing to admit that I have some poetical abilities ; and as few , if any , writers , either moral or poetical , are intimately acquainted with the classes of mankind among whom I have chiefly mingled , I may have seen men and manners in a different phasis from what is common , which may assist originality of thought . Still I know very well the novelty of my character has by far the greatest share in the learned and polite notice I have lately had ; and in a language where Pope and Churchill have raised the laugh , and Shenstone and Gray drawn the tear ; where Thomson and Beattie have painted the landscape , and Lyttelton and Collins described the heart , I am not vain enough to hope for distinguished poetic fame .</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . G. LAURIE ,</head>
    <head>NEWMILLS , NEAR KILMARNOCK .</head>
    <note>It has been said in the Life of Burns , that for some time after he went to Edinburgh , he did not visit Dr. Blacklock , whose high opinion of his genius induced him to try his fortune in that city : it will be seen by this letter that he had neglected also , for a time , at least , to write to Dr. Laurie , who introduced him to the Doctor .</note>
     <l n="1">Edinburgh , Feb. 5th , 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>REVEREND AND DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>When I look at the date of your kind letter , my heart reproaches me severely with ingratitude in neglecting so long to answer it . I will not trouble you with any account , by way of apology , of my hurried life and distracted attention : do me the justice to believe that my delay by no means proceeded from want of respect . I feel , and ever shall feel for you the mingled sentiments of esteem for a friend and reverence for a father .</p>
   <p>I thank you , Sir , with all my soul for your friendly hints , though I do not need them so much as my friends are apt to imagine . You are dazzled with newspaper accounts and distant reports ; but , in reality , I have no great temptation to be intoxicated with the cup of prosperity . Novelty may attract the attention of mankind awhile ; to it I owe my present éclat ; but I see the time not far distant when the popular tide which has borne me to a height of which I am , perhaps , unworthy , shall recede with silent celerity , and leave me a barren waste of sand , to descend at my leisure to my former station . I do not say this in the affectation of modesty ; I see the consequence is unavoidable , and am prepared for it . I had been at a good deal of pains to form a just , impartial estimate of my intellectual powers before I came here ; I have not added , since I came to Edinburgh , anything to the account ; and I trust I shall take every atom of it back to my shades , the coverts of my unnoticed , early years .</p>
   <p>In Dr. Blacklock , whom I see very often , I have found what I would have expected in our friend , a clear head and an excellent heart .</p>
   <p>By far the most agreeable hours I spend in Edinburgh must be placed to the account of Miss Laurie and her piano-forte . I cannot help repeating to you and Mrs. Laurie a compliment that Mr. Mackenzie , the celebrated “ Man of Feeling , ” paid to Miss Laurie , the other night , at the concert . I had come in at the interlude , and sat down by him till I saw Miss Laurie in a seat not very distant , and went up to pay my respects to her . On my return to Mr. Mackenzie he asked me who she was ; I told him ‘ twas the daughter of a reverend friend of mine in the west country . He returned , there was something very striking , to his idea , in her appearance . On my desiring to know what it was , he was pleased to say , “ She has a great deal of the elegance of a well-bred lady about her , with all the sweet simplicity of a country girl . ”</p>
   <p>My compliments to all the happy inmates of St. Margaret 's .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Pardon my seeming neglect in delaying so long to acknowledge the honour you have done me , in your kind notice of me , January 23d . Not many months ago I knew no other employment than following the plough , nor could boast anything higher than a distant acquaintance with a country clergyman . Mere greatness never embarrasses me ; I have nothing to ask from the great , and I do not fear their judgment : but genius , polished by learning , and at its proper point of elevation in the eye of the world , this of late I frequently meet with , and tremble at its approach . I scorn the affectation of seeming modesty to cover self-conceit . That I have some merit I do not deny ; but I see with frequent wringings of heart , that the novelty of my character , and the honest national prejudice of my countrymen , have borne me to a height altogether untenable to my abilities .</p>
   <p>For the honour Miss Williams has done me , please , Sir , return her in my name my most grateful thanks . I have more than once thought of paying her in kind , but have hitherto quitted the idea in hopeless despondency . I had never before heard of her ; but the other day I got her poems , which for several reasons , some belonging to the head , and others the offspring of the heart , give me a great deal of pleasure . I have little pretensions to critic lore ; there are , I think , two characteristic features in her poetry — the unfettered wild flight of native genius , and the querulous sombre tenderness of “ time-settled sorrow . ”</p>
   <p>I only know what pleases me , often without being able to tell why .</p>

    <head>TO THE EARL OF GLENCAIRN .</head>
    <note>The Earl of Glencairn seems to have refused , from motives of delicacy , the request of the poet : the verses , long lost , were at last found , and are now , through the kindness of my friend , Major James Glencairn Burns , printed with the rest of his eminent father 's works .</note>
     <l n="1">Edinburgh , 1787</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>I wanted to purchase a profile of your lordship , which I was told was to be got in town ; but I am truly sorry to see that a blundering painter has spoiled a “ human face divine . ” The enclosed stanzas I intended to have written below a picture or profile of your lordship , could I have been so happy as to procure one with anything of a likeness .</p>
   <p>As I will soon return to my shades , I wanted to have something like a material object for my gratitude ; I wanted to have it in my power to say to a friend , there is my noble patron , my generous benefactor . Allow me , my lord , to publish these verses . I conjure your lordship , by the honest throe of gratitude , by the generous wish of benevolence , by all the powers and feelings which compose the magnanimous mind , do not deny me this petition . I owe much to your lordship : and , what has not in some other instances always been the case with me , the weight of the obligation is a pleasing load . I trust I have a heart as independent as your lordship 's , than which I can say nothing more ; and I would not be beholden to favours that would crucify my feelings . Your dignified character in life , and manner of supporting that character , are flattering to my pride ; and I would be jealous of the purity of my grateful attachment , where I was under the patronage of one of the much favoured sons of fortune .</p>
   <p>Almost every poet has celebrated his patrons , particularly when they were names dear to fame , and illustrious in their country ; allow me , then , my lord , if you think the verses have intrinsic merit , to tell the world how much I have the honour to be ,</p>
   <p>Your lordship 's highly indebted ,</p>
   <p>And ever grateful humble servant ,</p>

   <p>TO THE EARL OF BUCHAN .</p>
   <note>The Earl of Buchan , a man of talent , but more than tolerably vain , advised Burns to visit the battle-fields and scenes celebrated in song on the Scottish border , with the hope , perhaps , that he would drop a few of his happy verses in Dryburgh Abbey , the residence of his lordship .</note>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MY LORD ,</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The honour your lordship has done me , by your notice and advice in</l>
     <l n="2">yours of the 1st instant , I shall ever gratefully remember :—</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Your lordship touches the darling chord of my heart when you advise me to fire my muse at Scottish story and Scotch scenes . I wish for nothing more than to make a leisurely pilgrimage through my native country ; to sit and muse on those once hard-contended fields , where Caledonia , rejoicing , saw her bloody lion borne through broken ranks to victory and fame ; and , catching the inspiration , to pour the deathless names in song . But , my lord , in the midst of these enthusiastic reveries , a long-visaged , dry , moral-looking phantom strides across my imagination , and pronounces these emphatic words :—</p>
   <p>“ I , Wisdom , dwell with Prudence . Friend , I do not come to open the ill-closed wounds of your follies and misfortunes , merely to give you pain : I wish through these wounds to imprint a lasting lesson on your heart . I will not mention how many of my salutary advices you have despised : I have given you line upon line and precept upon precept ; and while I was chalking out to you the straight way to wealth and character , with audacious effrontery you have zigzagged across the path , contemning me to my face : you know the consequences . It is not yet three months since home was so hot for you that you were on the wing for the western shore of the Atlantic , not to make a fortune , but to hide your misfortune .</p>
   <p>“ Now that your dear-loved Scotia puts it in your power to return to the situation of your forefathers , will you follow these will-o ’ - wisp meteors of fancy and whim , till they bring you once more to the brink of ruin ? I grant that the utmost ground you can occupy is but half a step from the veriest poverty ; but still it is half a step from it . If all that I can urge be ineffectual , let her who seldom calls to you in vain , let the call of pride prevail with you . You know how you feel at the iron gripe of ruthless oppression : you know how you bear the galling sneer of contumelious greatness . I hold you out the conveniences , the comforts of life , independence , and character , on the one hand ; I tender you civility , dependence , and wretchedness , on the other . I will not insult your understanding by bidding you make a choice . ”</p>
   <p>This , my lord , is unanswerable . I must return to my humble station , and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way at the plough-tail . Still , my lord , while the drops of life warm my heart , gratitude to that dear-loved country in which I boast my birth , and gratitude to those her distinguished sons who have honoured me so much with their patronage and approbation , shall , while stealing through my humble shades ; ever distend my bosom , and at times , as now , draw forth the swelling tear .</p>

   <p>MY EVER DEAR OLD ACQUAINTANCE ,</p>
   <p>I was equally surprised and pleased at your letter , though I dare say you will think by my delaying so long to write to you that I am so drowned in the intoxication of good fortune as to be indifferent to old , and once dear connexions . The truth is , I was determined to write a good letter , full of argument , amplification , erudition , and , as Bayes says , all that . I thought of it , and thought of it , and , by my soul , I could not ; and , lest you should mistake the cause of my silence , I just sit down to tell you so . Do n't give yourself credit , though , that the strength of your logic scares me : the truth is , I never mean to meet you on that ground at all . You have shown me one thing which was to be demonstrated : that strong pride of reasoning , with a little affectation of singularity , may mislead the best of hearts . I likewise , since you and I were first acquainted , in the pride of despising old woman 's stories , ventured in “ the daring path Spinosa trod ; ” but experience of the weakness , not the strength of human powers , made me glad to grasp at revealed religion .</p>
   <p>I am still , in the Apostle Paul 's phrase , “ The old man with his deeds , ” as when we were sporting about the “ Lady Thorn . ” I shall be four weeks here yet at least ; and so I shall expect to hear from you ; welcome sense , welcome nonsense .</p>

    <note>The name of the friend to whom this letter was addressed is still unknown , though known to Dr. Currie . The Esculapian Club of Edinburgh have , since the death of Burns , added some iron-work , with an inscription in honour of the Ayrshire poet to the original headstone . The cost to the poet was £ 5 10s .</note>
     <l n="1">Edinburgh , March , 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>You may think , and too justly , that I am a selfish , ungrateful fellow , having received so many repeated instances of kindness from you , and yet never putting pen to paper to say thank you ; but if you knew what a devil of a life my conscience has led me on that account , your good heart would think yourself too much avenged . By the bye , there is nothing in the whole frame of man which seems to be so unaccountable as that thing called conscience . Had the troublesome yelping cur powers efficient to prevent a mischief , he might be of use ; but at the beginning of the business , his feeble efforts are to the workings of passion as the infant frosts of an autumnal morning to the unclouded fervour of the rising sun : and no sooner are the tumultuous doings of the wicked deed over , than , amidst the bitter native consequences of folly , in the very vortex of our horrors , up starts conscience , and harrows us with the feelings of the damned .</p>
   <p>I have enclosed you , by way of expiation , some verse and prose , that , if they merit a place in your truly entertaining miscellany , you are welcome to . The prose extract is literally as Mr. Sprott sent it me .</p>
   <p>The inscription on the stone is as follows :—</p>

   <p>Sederunt of the Managers of the Kirk and Kirk-Yard funds of Canongate .</p>
   <p>Which day , the treasurer to the said funds produced a letter from Mr. Robert Burns , of date the 6th current , which was read and appointed to be engrossed in their sederunt book , and of which letter the tenor follows :—</p>
   <p>“ To the honourable baillies of Canongate , Edinburgh .— Gentlemen , I am sorry to be told that the remains of Robert Fergusson , the so justly celebrated poet , a man whose talents for ages to come will do honour to our Caledonian name , lie in your church-yard among the ignoble dead , unnoticed and unknown .</p>
   <p>“ Some memorial to direct the steps of the lovers of Scottish song , when they wish to shed a tear over the ‘ narrow house ’ of the bard who is no more , is surely a tribute due to Fergusson 's memory : a tribute I wish to have the honour of paying .</p>
   <p>“ I petition you then , gentlemen , to permit me to lay a simple stone over his revered ashes , to remain an unalienable property to his deathless fame . I have the honour to be , gentlemen , your very humble servant ( sic subscribitur ) ,</p>
   <p>ROBERT BURNS . ”</p>
   <p>Thereafter the said managers , in consideration of the laudable and disinterested motion of Mr. Burns , and the propriety of his request , did , and hereby do , unanimously , grant power and liberty to the said Robert Burns to erect a headstone at the grave of the said Robert Fergusson , and to keep up and preserve the same to his memory in all time coming .

    <head>I read your letter with watery eyes . A little , very little while ago , I had scarce a friend but the stubborn pride of my own bosom : now I am distinguished , patronized , befriended by you . Your friendly advices , I will not give them the cold name of criticisms , I receive with reverence . I have made some small alterations in what I before had printed . I have the advice of some very judicious friends among the literati here , but with them I sometimes find it necessary to claim the privilege of thinking for myself . The noble Karl of Glencairn , to whom I owe more than to any man , does me the honor of giving me his strictures : his hints , with respect to impropriety or indelicacy , I follow implicitly .</head>

   <p>The appellation of a Scottish bard , is by far my highest pride ; to continue to deserve it is my most exalted ambition . Scottish scenes and Scottish story are the themes I could wish to sing . I have no dearer aim than to have it in my power , unplagued with the routine of business , for which heaven knows I am unfit enough , to make leisurely pilgrimages through Caledonia ; to sit on the fields of her battles ; to wander on the romantic banks of her rivers ; and to muse by the stately towers or venerable ruins , once the honoured abodes of her heroes .</p>
   <p>But these are all Utopian thoughts : I have dallied long enough with life ; ‘ tis time to be in earnest . I have a fond , an aged mother to care for : and some other bosom ties perhaps equally tender . Where the individual only suffers by the consequences of his own thoughtlessness , indolence , or folly , he may be excusable ; nay , shining abilities , and some of the nobler virtues , may half sanctify a heedless character ; but where God and nature have intrusted the welfare of others to his care ; where the trust is sacred , and the ties are dear , that man must be far gone in selfishness , or strangely lost to reflection , whom these connexions will not rouse to exertion .</p>
   <p>I guess that I shall clear between two and three hundred pounds by my authorship ; with that sum I intend , so far as I may be said to have any intention , to return to my old acquaintance , the plough , and if I can meet with a lease by which I can live , to commence farmer . I do not intend to give up poetry ; being bred to labour , secures me independence , and the muses are my chief , sometimes have been my only enjoyment . If my practice second my resolution , I shall have principally at heart the serious business of life ; but while following my plough , or building up my shocks , I shall cast a leisure glance to that dear , that only feature of my character , which gave me the notice of my country , and the patronage of a Wallace .</p>
   <p>Thus , honoured Madam , I have given you the bard , his situation , and his views , native as they are in his own bosom .</p>

   <p>I received the books , and sent the one you mentioned to Mrs. Dunlop . I am ill skilled in beating the coverts of imagination for metaphors of gratitude . I thank you , Sir , for the honour you have done me ; and to my latest hour will warmly remember it .

   <p>I leave Edinburgh in the course of ten days or a fortnight , and after a few pilgrimages over some of the classic ground of Caledonia , Cowden Knowes , Banks of Yarrow , Tweed , &amp; c ., I shall return to my rural shades , in all likelihood never more to quit them . I have formed many intimacies and friendships here , but I am afraid they are all of too tender a construction to bear carriage a hundred and fifty miles .

   <p>—— Your criticisms , Madam , I understand very well , and could have wished to have pleased you better . You are right in your guess that I am not very amenable to counsel .

   <p>I set as little by princes , lords , clergy , critics , &amp; c ., as all these respective gentry do by my bardship . I know what I may expect from the word , by and by — illiberal abuse , and perhaps contemptuous neglect .</p>
   <p>I am happy , Madam , that some of my own favourite pieces are distinguished by your particular approbation . For my “ Dream , ” which has unfortunately incurred your loyal displeasure , I hope in four weeks , or less , to have the honour of appearing , at Dunlop , in its defence in person .</p>

   <p>REVEREND AND MUCH-RESPECTED SIR ,</p>
   <p>I leave Edinburgh to-morrow morning , but could not go without troubling you with half a line , sincerely to thank you for the kindness , patronage , and friendship you have shown me . I often felt the embarrassment of my singular situation ; drawn forth from the veriest shades of life to the glare of remark ; and honoured by the notice of those illustrious names of my country whose works , while they are applauded to the end of time , will ever instruct and mend the heart . However the meteor-like novelty of my appearance in the world might attract notice , and honour me with the acquaintance of the permanent lights of genius and literature , those who are truly benefactors of the immortal nature of man , I knew very well that my utmost merit was far unequal to the task of preserving that character when once the novelty was over ; I have made up my mind that abuse , or almost even neglect , will not surprise me in my quarters .</p>
   <p>I have sent you a proof impression of Beugo 's work<span corresp="#note171" type="note_anchor">[ 171 ]</span>for me , done on Indian paper , as a trifling but sincere testimony with what heart-warm gratitude I am , &amp; c .</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>In justice to Spenser , I must acknowledge that there is scarcely a poet in the language could have been a more agreeable present to me ; and in justice to you , allow me to say , Sir , that I have not met with a man in Edinburgh to whom I would so willingly have been indebted for the gift . The tattered rhymes I herewith present you , and the handsome volumes of Spenser for which I am so much indebted to your goodness , may perhaps be not in proportion to one another ; but be that as it may , my gift , though far less valuable , is as sincere a mark of esteem as yours .</p>
   <p>The time is approaching when I shall return to my shades ; and I am afraid my numerous Edinburgh friendships are of so tender a construction , that they will not bear carriage with me . Yours is one of the few that I could wish of a more robust constitution . It is indeed very probable that when I leave this city , we part never more to meet in this sublunary sphere ; but I have a strong fancy that in some future eccentric planet , the comet of happier systems than any with which astronomy is yet acquainted , you and I , among the harum scarum sons of imagination and whim , with a hearty shake of a hand , a metaphor and a laugh , shall recognise old acquaintance :</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I am sorry I was out of Edinburgh , making a slight pilgrimage to the classic scenes of this country , when I was favoured with yours of the 11th instant , enclosing an order of the Paisley banking company on the royal bank , for twenty-two pounds seven shillings sterling , payment in full , after carriage deducted , for ninety copies of my book I sent you . According to your motions , I see you will have left Scotland before this reaches you , otherwise I would send you “ Holy Willie ” with all my heart . I was so hurried that I absolutely forgot several things I ought to have minded , among the rest sending books to Mr. Cowan ; but any order of yours will be answered at Creech 's shop . You will please remember that non-subscribers pay six shillings , this is Creech 's profit ; but those who have subscribed , though their names have been neglected in the printed list , which is very incorrect , are supplied at subscription price . I was not at Glasgow , nor do I intend for London ; and I think Mrs . Fame is very idle to tell so many lies on a poor poet . When you or Mr. Cowan write for copies , if you should want any direct to Mr. Hill , at Mr. Creech 's shop , and I write to Mr. Hill by this post , to answer either of your orders . Hill is Mr. Creech 's first clerk , and Creech himself is presently in London . I suppose I shall have the pleasure , against your return to Paisley , of assuring you how much I am , dear Sir , your obliged humble servant ,</p>

   <p>Mauchline , June 18 , 1787 .</p>
   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>I am now arrived safe in my native country , after a very agreeable jaunt , and have the pleasure to find all my friends well . I breakfasted with your gray-headed , reverend friend , Mr. Smith ; and was highly pleased both with the cordial welcome he gave me , and his most excellent appearance and sterling good sense .</p>
   <p>I have been with Mr. Miller at Dalswinton , and am to meet him again in August . From my view of the lands , and his reception of my bardship , my hopes in that business are rather mended ; but still they are but slender .</p>
   <p>I am quite charmed with Dumfries folks — Mr. Burnside , the clergyman , in particular , is a man whom I shall ever gratefully remember ; and his wife , Gude forgie me ! I had almost broke the tenth commandment on her account . Simplicity , elegance , good sense , sweetness of disposition , good humour , kind hospitality are the constituents of her manner and heart ; in short — but if I say one word more about her , I shall be directly in love with her .</p>
   <p>I never , my friend , thought mankind very capable of anything generous ; but the stateliness of the patricians in Edinburgh , and the servility of my plebeian brethren ( who perhaps formerly eyed me askance ) since I returned home , have nearly put me out of conceit altogether with my species . I have bought a pocket Milton , which I carry perpetually about with me , in order to study the sentiments — the dauntless magnanimity , the intrepid , unyielding independence , the desperate daring , and noble defiance of hardship , in that great personage , SATAN . ‘ Tis true , I have just now a little cash ; but I am afraid the star that hitherto has shed its malignant , purpose-blasting rays full in my zenith ; that noxious planet so baneful in its influences to the rhyming tribe , I much dread it is not yet beneath my horizon .— Misfortune dodges the path of human life ; the poetic mind finds itself miserably deranged in , and unfit for the walks of business ; add to all , that thoughtless follies and hare-brained whims , like so many ignes fatui , eternally diverging from the right line of sober discretion , sparkle with step-bewitching blaze in the idly-gazing eyes of the poor heedless bard , till , pop , “ he falls like Lucifer , never to hope again . ” God grant this may be an unreal picture with respect to me ! but should it not , I have very little dependence on mankind . I will close my letter with this tribute my heart bids me pay you — the many ties of acquaintance and friendship which I have , or think I have in life , I have felt along the lines , and , damn them , they are almost all of them of such frail contexture , that I am sure they would not stand the breath of the least adverse breeze of fortune ; but from you , my ever dear Sir , I look with confidence for the apostolic love that shall wait on me “ through good report and bad report ” — the love which Solomon emphatically says “ is strong as death . ” My compliments to Mrs. Nicol , and all the circle of our common friends .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>On our return , at a Highland gentleman 's hospitable mansion , we fell in with a merry party , and danced till the ladies left us , at three in the morning . Our dancing was none of the French or English insipid formal movements ; the ladies sung Scotch songs like angels , at intervals ; then we flew at Bab at the Bowster , Tullochgorum , Loch Erroch Side , &amp; c ., like midges sporting in the mottie sun , or craws prognosticating a storm in a hairst day .— When the dear lasses left us , we ranged round the bowl till the good-fellow hour of six ; except a few minutes that we went out to pay our devotions to the glorious lamp of day peering over the towering top of Benlomond . We all kneeled ; our worthy landlord 's son held the bowl ; each man a full glass in his hand ; and I , as priest , repeated some rhyming nonsense , like Thomas-a-Rhymer 's prophecies I suppose .— After a small refreshment of the gifts of Somnus , we proceeded to spend the day on Lochlomond , and reach Dumbarton in the evening . We dined at another good fellow 's house , and consequently , pushed the bottle ; when we went out to mount our horses , we found ourselves “ No vera fou but gaylie yet . ” My two friends and I rode soberly down the Loch side , till by came a Highlandman at the gallop , on a tolerably good horse , but which had never known the ornaments of iron or leather . We scorned to be out-galloped by a Highlandman , so off we started , whip and spur . My companions , though seemingly gaily mounted , fell sadly astern ; but my old mare , Jenny Geddes , one of the Rosinante family , she strained past the Highlandman in spite of all his efforts with the hair halter ; just as I was passing him , Donald wheeled his horse , as if to cross before me to mar my progress , when down came his horse , and threw his rider 's breekless a —— e in a clipt hedge ; and down came Jenny Geddes over all , and my bardship between her and the Highlandman 's horse . Jenny Geddes trode over me with such cautious reverence , that matters were not so bad as might well have been expected ; so I came off with a few cuts and bruises , and a thorough resolution to be a pattern of sobriety for the future .</p>
   <p>I have yet fixed on nothing with respect to the serious business of life . I am , just as usual , a rhyming , mason-making , raking , aimless , idle fellow . However , I shall somewhere have a farm soon . I was going to say , a wife too ; but that must never be my blessed lot . I am but a younger son of the house of Parnassus , and like other younger sons of great families , I may intrigue , if I choose to run all risks , but must not marry .</p>
   <p>I am afraid I have almost ruined one source , the principal one , indeed , of my former happiness ; that eternal propensity I always had to fall in love . My heart no more glows with feverish rapture . I have no paradisaical evening interviews , stolen from the restless cares and prying inhabitants of this weary world . I have only * * * *. This last is one of your distant acquaintances , has a fine figure , and elegant manners ; and in the train of some great folks whom you know , has seen , the politest quarters in Europe . I do like her a good deal ; but what piques me is her conduct at the commencement of our acquaintance . I frequently visited her when I was in ——, and after passing regularly the intermediate degrees between the distant formal bow and the familiar grasp round the waist , I ventured , in my careless way , to talk of friendship in rather ambiguous terms ; and after her return to ——, I wrote to her in the same style . Miss , construing my words farther I suppose than even I intended , flew off in a tangent of female dignity and reserve , like a mounting lark in an April morning ; and wrote me an answer which measured me out very completely what an immense way I had to travel before I could reach the climate of her favour . But I am an old hawk at the sport , and wrote her such a cool , deliberate , prudent reply , as brought my bird from her aerial towerings , pop , down at my foot , like Corporal Trim 's hat .</p>
   <p>As for the rest of my acts , and my wars , and all my wise sayings , and why my mare was called Jenny Geddes , they shall be recorded in a few weeks hence at Linlithgow , in the chronicles of your memory , by</p>

    <head>MY DEAR RICHMOND ,</head>
    <head>I am all impatience to hear of your fate since the old confounder of right and wrong has turned you out of place , by his journey to answer his indictment at the bar of the other world . He will find the practice of the court so different from the practice in which he has for so many years been thoroughly hackneyed , that his friends , if he had any connexions truly of that kind , which I rather doubt , may well tremble for his sake . His chicane , his left-handed wisdom , which stood so firmly by him , to such good purpose , here , like other accomplices in robbery and plunder , will , now the piratical business is blown , in all probability turn the king 's evidences , and then the devil 's bagpiper will touch him off “ Bundle and go ! ”</head>

   <p>I have lately been rambling over by Dumbarton and Inverary , and running a drunken race on the side of Loch Lomond with a wild Highlandman ; his horse , which had never known the ornaments of iron or leather , zigzagged across before my old spavin 'd hunter , whose name is Jenny Geddes , and down came the Highlandman , horse and all , and down came Jenny and my bardship ; so I have got such a skinful of bruises and wounds , that I shall be at least four weeks before I dare venture on my journey to Edinburgh .</p>
   <p>Not one new thing under the sun has happened in Mauchline since you left it . I hope this will find you as comfortably situated as formerly , or , if heaven pleases , more so ; but , at all events , I trust you will let me know of course how matters stand with you , well or ill. ‘ Tis but poor consolation to tell the world when matters go wrong ; but you know very well your connexion and mine stands on a different footing .</p>

    <head>MY DEAR AINSLIE ,</head>
    <head>There is one thing for which I set great store by you as a friend , and it is this , that I have not a friend upon earth , besides yourself , to whom I can talk nonsense without forfeiting some degree of his esteem . Now , to one like me , who never cares for speaking anything else but nonsense , such a friend as you is an invaluable treasure . I was never a rogue , but have been a fool all my life ; and , in spite of all my endeavours , I see now plainly that I shall never be wise . Now it rejoices my heart to have met with such a fellow as you , who , though you are not just such a hopeless fool as I , yet I trust you will never listen so much to the temptations of the devil as to grow so very wise that you will in the least disrespect an honest follow because he is a fool . In short , I have set you down as the staff of my old age , when the whole list of my friends will , after a decent share of pity , have forgot me .</head>

    <note>The “ savage hospitality , ” of which Burns complains in this letter , was at that time an evil fashion in Scotland : the bottle was made to circulate rapidly , and every glass was drunk “ clean caup out . ”</note>

   </lg>
   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>My life , since I saw you last , has been one continued hurry ; that savage hospitality which knocks a man down with strong liquors , is the devil . I have a sore warfare in this world ; the devil , the world , and the flesh are three formidable foes . The first I generally try to fly from ; the second , alas ! generally flies from me ; but the third is my plague , worse than the ten plagues of Egypt .</p>
   <p>I have been looking over several farms in this country ; one in particular , in Nithsdale , pleased me so well , that if my offer to the proprietor is accepted , I shall commence farmer at Whit-Sunday . If farming do not appear eligible , I shall have recourse to my other shift : but this to a friend .</p>
   <p>I set out for Edinburgh on Monday morning ; how long I stay there is uncertain , but you will know so soon as I can inform you myself . However I determine , poesy must be laid aside for some time ; my mind has been vitiated with idleness , and it will take a good deal of effort to habituate it to the routine of business .</p>
   <p>I am , my dear Sir ,</p>
   <p>Yours sincerely ,</p>

    <head>TO DR. MOORE .</head>
    <note>Dr. Moore was one of the first to point out the beauty of the lyric compositions of Burns . “ ‘ Green grow the Rashes , ’ and of the two songs , ” says he , “ which follow , beginning ‘ Again rejoicing nature sees , ’ and ‘ The gloomy night is gathering fast ; ’ the latter is exquisite . By the way , I imagine you have a peculiar talent for such compositions which you ought to indulge : no kind of poetry demands more delicacy or higher polishing . ” On this letter to Moore all the biographies of Burns are founded .</note>
     <l n="1">Mauchline , 2d August , 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>For some months past I have been rambling over the country , but I am now confined with some lingering complaints , originating , as I take it , in the stomach . To divert my spirits a little in this miserable fog of ennui , I have taken a whim to give you a history of myself . My name has made some little noise in this country ; you have done me the honour to interest yourself very warmly in my behalf ; and I think a faithful account of what character of a man I am , and how I came by that character , may perhaps amuse you in an idle moment . I will give you an honest narrative , though I know it will be often at my own expense ; for I assure you , Sir , I have , like Solomon , whose character , excepting in the trifling affair of wisdom , I sometimes think I resemble ,— I have , I say , like him turned my eyes to behold madness and folly , and like him , too , frequently shaken hands with their intoxicating friendship .— After you have perused these pages , should you think them trifling and impertinent , I only beg leave to tell you , that the poor author wrote them under some twitching qualms of conscience , arising from a suspicion that he was doing what he ought not to do ; a predicament he has more than once been in before .</p>
   <p>I have not the most distant pretensions to assume that character which the pye-coated guardians of escutcheons call a gentleman . When at Edinburgh last winter , I got acquainted in the herald 's office ; and , looking through that granary of honours , I there found almost every name in the kingdom ; but for me ,</p>

   <p>My father was of the north of Scotland , the son of a farmer , and was thrown by early misfortunes on the world at large ; where , after many years ’ wanderings and sojournings , he picked up a pretty large quantity of observation and experience , to which I am indebted for most of my little pretensions to wisdom — I have met with few who understood men , their manners , and their ways , equal to him ; but stubborn , ungainly integrity , and headlong , ungovernable irascibility , are disqualifying circumstances ; consequently , I was born a very poor man 's son . For the first six or seven years of my life , my father was gardener to a worthy gentleman of small estate in the neighbourhood of Ayr . Had he continued in that station I must have marched off to be one of the little underlings about a farm-house ; but it was his dearest wish and prayer to have it in his power to keep his children under his own eye , till they could discern between good and evil ; so , with the assistance of his generous master , my father ventured on a small farm on his estate . At those years , I was by no means a favourite with anybody . I was a good deal noted for a retentive memory , a stubborn sturdy something in my disposition , and an enthusiastic idiot<span corresp="#note175" type="note_anchor">[ 175 ]</span>piety . I say idiot piety , because I was then but a child . Though it cost the schoolmaster some thrashings , I made an excellent English , scholar ; and by the time I was ten or eleven years of age , I was a critic in substantives , verbs , and particles . In my infant and boyish days , too , I owed much to an old woman who resided in the family , remarkable for her ignorance , credulity , and superstition . She had , I suppose , the largest collection in the country of tales and songs concerning devils , ghosts , fairies , brownies , witches , warlocks , spunkies , kelpies , elf-candles , dead-lights , wraiths , apparitions , cantraips , giants , enchanted towers , dragons , and other trumpery . This cultivated the latent seeds of poetry ; but had so strong an effect on my imagination , that to this hour , in my nocturnal rambles , I sometimes keep a sharp look out in suspicions places ; and though nobody can be more sceptical than I am in such matters , yet it often takes an effort of philosophy to shake off these idle terrors . The earliest composition that I recollect taking pleasure in , was The Vision of Mirza , and a hymn of Addison 's beginning , “ How are thy servants blest , O Lord ! ” I particularly remember one half-stanza which was music to my boyish ear —</p>

   </lg>
   <p>I met with these pieces in Mason 's English Collection , one of my school-books . The first two books I ever read in private , and which gave me more pleasure than any two books I ever read since , were The Life of Hannibal , and The History of Sir William Wallace . Hannibal gave my young ideas such a turn , that I used to strut in raptures up and down after the recruiting drum and bag-pipe , and wish myself tall enough to be a soldier ; while the story of Wallace poured a Scottish prejudice into my veins , which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest .</p>
   <p>Polemical divinity about this time was putting the country half mad , and I , ambitious of shining in conversation parties on Sundays , between sermons , at funerals , &amp; c ., used a few years afterwards to puzzle Calvinism with so much heat and indiscretion , that I raised a hue and cry of heresy against me , which has not ceased to this hour .</p>
   <p>My vicinity to Ayr was of some advantage to me . My social disposition , when not checked by some modifications of spirited pride , was like our catechism definition of infinitude , without bounds or limits . I formed several connexions with other younkers , who possessed superior advantages ; the youngling actors who were busy in the rehearsal of parts , in which they were shortly to appear on the stage of life , where , alas ! I was destined to drudge behind the scenes . It is not commonly at this green age , that our young gentry have a just sense of the immense distance between them and their ragged playfellows . It takes a few dashes into the world , to give the young great man that proper , decent , unnoticing disregard for the poor , insignificant stupid devils , the mechanics and peasantry around him , who were , perhaps , born in the same village . My young superiors never insulted the clouterly appearance of my plough-boy carcase , the two extremes of which were often exposed to all the inclemencies of all the seasons . They would give me stray volumes of books ; among them , even then , I could pick up some observations , and one , whose heart , I am sure , not even the “ Munny Begum ” scenes have tainted , helped me to a little French . Parting with these my young friends and benefactors , as they occasionally went off for the East or West Indies , was often to me a sore affliction ; but I was soon called to more serious evils . My father 's generous master died ! the farm proved a ruinous bargain ; and to clench the misfortune , we fell into the hands of a factor , who sat for the picture I have drawn of one in my tale of “ The Twa Dogs . ” My father was advanced in life when he married ; I was the eldest of seven children , and he , worn out by early hardships , was unfit for labour . My father 's spirit was soon irritated , but not easily broken . There was a freedom in his lease in two years more , and to weather these two years , we retrenched our expenses . We lived very poorly : I was a dexterous ploughman for my age ; and the next eldest to me was a brother ( Gilbert ) , who could drive the plough very well , and help me to thrash the corn . A novel-writer might , perhaps , have viewed these scenes with some satisfaction , but so did not I ; my indignation yet boils at the recollection of the scoundrel factor 's insolent threatening letters , which used to set us all in tears .</p>
   <p>This kind of life — the cheerless gloom of a hermit , with the unceasing moil of a galley-slave , brought me to my sixteenth year ; a little before which period I first committed the sin of rhyme . You know our country custom of coupling a man and woman together as partners in the labours of harvest . In my fifteenth autumn , my partner was a bewitching creature , a year younger than myself . My scarcity of English denies me the power of doing her justice in that language , but you know the Scottish idiom : she was a “ bonnie , sweet , sonsie lass . ” In short , she , altogether unwittingly to herself , initiated me in that delicious passion , which , in spite of acid disappointment , gin-horse prudence , and bookworm philosophy , I hold to be the first of human joys , our dearest blessing here below ! How she caught the contagion I cannot tell ; you medical people talk much of infection from breathing the same air , the touch , &amp; c .; but I never expressly said I loved her .— Indeed , I did not know myself why I liked so much to loiter behind with her , when returning in the evening from our labours ; why the tones of her voice made my heart-strings thrill like an Æolian harp ; and particularly why my pulse beat such a furious ratan , when I looked and fingered over her little hand to pick out the cruel nettle-stings and thistles . Among her other love-inspiring qualities , she sung sweetly ; and it was her favourite reel to which I attempted giving an embodied vehicle in ryhme . I was not so presumptuous as to imagine that I could make verses like printed ones , composed by men who had Greek and Latin ; but my girl sung a song which was said to be composed by a small country laird 's son , on one of his father 's maids , with whom he was in love ; and I saw no reason why I might not rhyme as well as he ; for excepting that he could smear sheep , and cast peats , his father living in the moorlands , he had no more scholar-craft than myself .</p>
   <p>Thus with me began love and poetry ; which at times have been my only , and till within the last twelve months , have been my highest enjoyment . My father struggled on till he reached the freedom in his lease , when he entered on a larger farm , about ten miles farther in the country . The nature of the bargain he made was such as to throw a little ready money into his hands at the commencement of his lease , otherwise the affair would have been impracticable . For four years we lived comfortably here , but a difference commencing between him and his landlord as to terms , after three years tossing and whirling in the vortex of litigation , my father was just saved from the horrors of a jail , by a consumption , which , after two years ’ promises , kindly stepped in , and carried him away , to where the wicked cease from troubling , and where the weary are at rest !</p>
   <p>It is during the time that we lived on this farm that my little story is most eventful . I was , at the beginning of this period , perhaps , the most ungainly awkward boy in the parish — no solitaire was less acquainted with the ways of the world . What I knew of ancient story was gathered from Salmon 's and Guthrie 's Geographical Grammars ; and the ideas I had formed of modern manners , of literature , and criticism , I got from the Spectator . These , with Pope 's Works , some Plays of Shakspeare , Tull and Dickson on Agriculture , the Pantheon , Locke 's Essay on the Human Understanding , Stackhouse 's History of the Bible , Justice 's British Gardener 's Directory , Boyle 's Lectures , Allan Ramsay 's Works , Taylor 's Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin , A Select Collection of English Songs , and Hervey 's Meditations , had formed the whole of my reading . The collection of Songs was my vade mecum . I pored over them , driving my cart , or walking to labour , song by song , verse by verse ; carefully noting the true tender , or sublime , from affectation and fustian . I am convinced I owe to this practice much of my critic craft , such as it is .</p>
   <p>In my seventeenth year , to give my manners a brush , I went to a country dancing-school . My father had an unaccountable antipathy against these meetings , and my going was , what to this moment I repent , in opposition to his wishes . My father , as I said before , was subject to strong passions ; from that instance of disobedience in me , he took a sort of dislike to me , which , I believe , was one cause of the dissipation which marked my succeeding years . I say dissipation , comparatively with the strictness , and sobriety , and regularity of Presbyterian country life ; for though the will-o ’ - wisp meteors of thoughtless whim were almost the sole lights of my path , yet early ingrained piety and virtue kept me for several years afterwards within the line of innocence . The great misfortune of my life was to want an aim . I had felt early some stirrings of ambition , but they were the blind gropings of Homer 's Cyclops round the walls of his cave . I saw my father 's situation entailed on me perpetual labour . The only two openings by which I could enter the temple of fortune were the gate of niggardly economy , or the path of little chicaning bargain-making . The first is so contracted an aperture I never could squeeze myself into it — the last I always hated — there was contamination in the very entrance ! Thus abandoned of aim or view in life , with a strong appetite for sociability , as well from native hilarity as from a pride of observation and remark ; a constitutional melancholy or hypochondriasm that made me fly solitude ; add to these incentives to social life , my reputation for bookish knowledge , a certain wild logical talent , and a strength of thought , something like the rudiments of good sense ; and it will not seem surprising that I was generally a welcome guest where I visited , or any great wonder that always , where two or three met together , there was I among them . But far beyond all other impulses of my heart , was un penchant à l ’ adorable moitié du genre humain . My heart was completely tinder , and was eternally lighted up by some goddess or other ; and , as in every other warfare in this world , my fortune was various ; sometimes I was received with favour , and sometimes I was mortified with a repulse . At the plough , scythe , or reap-hook , I feared no competitor , and thus I set absolute want at defiance ; and as I never cared farther for my labours than while I was in actual exercise , I spent the evenings in the way after my own heart . A country lad seldom carries on a love adventure without an assisting confidant . I possessed a curiosity , zeal , and intrepid dexterity that recommended me as a proper second on these occasions ; and I dare say , I felt as much pleasure in being in the secret of half the loves of the parish of Tarbolton , as ever did statesman in knowing the intrigues of half the courts of Europe . The very goose feather in my hand seems to know instinctively the well-worn path of my imagination , the favourite theme of my song ; and is with difficulty restrained from giving you a couple of paragraphs on the love-adventures of my compeers , the humble inmates of the farm-house and cottage ; but the grave sons of science , ambition , or avarice baptize these things by the name of follies . To the sons and daughters of labour and poverty they are matters of the most serious nature : to them the ardent hope , the stolen interview , the tender farewell , are the greatest and most delicious parts of their enjoyments .</p>
   <p>Another circumstance in my life which made some alteration in my mind and manners , was , that I spent my nineteenth summer on a smuggling coast , a good distance from home , at a noted school to learn mensuration , surveying , dialling , &amp; c ., in which I made a pretty good progress . But I made a greater progress in the knowledge of mankind . The contraband trade was at that time very successful , and it sometimes happened to me to fall in with those who carried it on . Scenes of swaggering riot and roaring dissipation were , till this time , new to me ; but I was no enemy to social life . Here , though I learnt to fill my glass , and to mix without fear in a drunken squabble , yet I went on with a high hand with my geometry , till the sun entered Virgo , a month which is always a carnival in my bosom , when a charming fillette , who lived next door to the school , overset my trigonometry , and set me off at a tangent from the spheres of my studies . I , however , struggled on with my sines and co-sines for a few days more ; but stepping into the garden one charming noon to take the sun 's altitude , there I met my angel ,</p>

     <l n="2">Herself a fairer flower — “<span corresp="#note176" type="note_anchor">[ 176 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>It was in vain to think of doing any more good at school . The remaining week I stayed I did nothing but craze the faculties of my soul about her , or steal out to meet her ; and the two last nights of my stay in the country , had sleep been a mortal sin , the image of this modest and innocent girl had kept me guiltless .</p>
   <p>I returned home very considerably improved . My reading was enlarged with the very important addition of Thomson 's and Shenstone 's works ; I had seen human nature in a new phasis ; and I engaged several of my school-fellows to keep up a literary correspondence with me . This improved me in composition . I had met with a collection of letters by the wits of Queen Anne 's reign , and I pored over them most devoutly . I kept copies of any of my own letters that pleased me , and a comparison between them and the composition of most of my correspondents flattered my vanity . I carried this whim so far , that though I hid not three-farthings ’ worth of business in the world , yet almost every post brought me as many letters as if I had been a broad plodding son of the day-book and ledger .</p>
   <p>My life flowed on much in the same course till my twenty-third year . Vive l'amour , et vive la bagatelle , were my sole principles of action . The addition of two more authors to my library gave me great pleasure ; Sterne and Mackenzie — Tristram Shandy and the Man of Feeling were my bosom favourites . Poesy was still a darling walk for my mind , but it was only indulged in according to the humour of the hour . I had usually half a dozen or more pieces on hand ; I took up one or other , as it suited the momentary tone of the mind , and dismissed the work as it bordered on fatigue . My passions , when once lighted up , raged like so many devils , till they got vent in rhyme ; and then the conning over my verses , like a spell , soothed all into quiet ! None of the rhymes of those days are in print , except “ Winter , a dirge , ” the eldest of my printed pieces ; “ The Death of poor Maillie , ” “ John Barleycorn , ” and songs first , second , and third . Song second was the ebullition of that passion which ended the forementioned school-business .</p>
   <p>My twenty-third year was to me an important æra . Partly through whim , and partly that I wished to set about doing something in life , I joined a flax-dresser in a neighboring town ( Irvine ) to learn his trade . This was an unlucky affair . My * * * and to finish the whole , as we were giving a welcome carousal to the new year , the shop took fire and burnt to ashes , and I was left , like a true poet , not worth a sixpence .</p>
   <p>I was obliged to give up this scheme ; the clouds of misfortune were gathering thick round my father 's head ; and , what was worst of all , he was visibly far gone in a consumption ; and to crown my distresses , a belle fille , whom I adored , and who had pledged her soul to meet me in the field of matrimony , jilted me , with peculiar circumstances of mortification . The finishing evil that brought up the rear of this infernal file , was my constitutional melancholy being increased to such a degree , that for three months I was in a state of mind scarcely to be envied by the hopeless wretches who have got their mittimus — depart from me , ye cursed !</p>
   <p>From this adventure I learned something of a town life ; but the principal thing which gave my mind a turn , was a friendship I formed with a young fellow , a very noble character , but a hapless son of misfortune . He was the son of a simple mechanic ; but a great man in the neighbourhood taking him under his patronage , gave him a genteel education , with a view of bettering his situation in life . The patron dying just as he was ready to launch out into the world , the poor fellow in despair went to sea ; where , after a variety of good and ill-fortune , a little before I was acquainted with him he had been set on shore by an American privateer , on the wild coast of Connaught , stripped of everything . I cannot quit this poor fellow 's story without adding , that he is at this time master of a large West-Indiaman belonging to the Thames .</p>
   <p>His mind was fraught with independence , magnanimity , and every manly virtue . I loved and admired him to a degree of enthusiasm , and of course strove to imitate him . In some measure I succeeded ; I had pride before , but he taught it to flow in proper channels . His knowledge of the world was vastly superior to mine , and I was all attention to learn . He was the only man I ever saw who was a greater fool than myself where woman was the presiding star ; but he spoke of illicit love with the levity of a sailor , which hitherto I had regarded with horror . Here his friendship did me a mischief , and the consequence was , that soon after I resumed the plough , I wrote the “ Poet 's Welcome . "[ 177 ] My reading only increased while in this town by two stray volumes of Pamela , and one of Ferdinand Count Fathom , which gave me some idea of novels . Rhyme , except some religious pieces that are in print , I had given up ; but meeting with Fergusson 's Scottish Poems , I strung anew my wildly-sounding lyre with emulating vigour . When my father died , his all went among the hell-hounds that growl in the kennel of justice ; but we made a shift to collect a little money in the family amongst us , with which , to keep us together , my brother and I took a neighbouring farm . My brother wanted my hair-brained imagination , as well as my social and amorous madness ; but in good sense , and every sober qualification , he was far my superior .</p>
   <p>I entered on this farm with a full resolution , “ come , go to , I will be wise ! ” I read farming books , I calculated crops ; I attended markets ; and in short , in spite of the devil , and the world , and the flesh , I believe I should have been a wise man ; but the first year , from unfortunately buying bad seed , the second from a late harvest , we lost half our crops . This overset all my wisdom , and I returned , “ like the dog to his vomit , and the sow that was washed , to her wallowing in the mire . ”</p>
   <p>I now began to be known in the neighbourhood as a maker of rhymes . The first of my poetic offspring that saw the light , was a burlesque lamentation on a quarrel between two reverend Calvinists , both of them dramatis personæ in “ Holy Fair . ” I had a notion myself that the piece had some merit ; but , to prevent the worst , I gave a copy of it to a friend , who was very fond of such things , and told him that I could not guess who was the author of it , but that I thought it pretty clever . With a certain description of the clergy , as well as laity , it met with a roar of applause . “ Holy Willie 's Prayer ” next made its appearance , and alarmed the kirk-session so much , that they held several meetings to look over their spiritual artillery , if haply any of it might be pointed against profane rhymers . Unluckily for me , my wanderings led me on another side , within point-blank shot of their heaviest metal . This is the unfortunate story that gave rise to my printed poem , “ The Lament . ” This was a most melancholy affair , which I cannot yet bear to reflect on , and had very nearly given me one or two of the principal qualifications for a place among those who have lost the chart , and mistaken the reckoning of rationality . I gave up my part of the farm to my brother ; in truth it was only nominally mine ; and made what little preparation was in my power for Jamaica . But , before leaving my native country for ever , I resolved to publish my poems . I weighed my productions as impartially as was in my power ; I thought they had merit ; and it was a delicious idea that I should be called a clever fellow , even though it should never reach my ears — a poor negro-driver — or perhaps a victim to that inhospitable clime , and gone to the world of spirits ! I can truly say , that pauvre inconnu as I then was , I had pretty nearly as high an idea of myself and of my works as I have at this moment , when the public has decided in their favour . It ever was my opinion that the mistakes and blunders , both in a rational and religious point of view , of which we see thousands daily guilty , are owing to their ignorance of themselves .— To know myself had been all along my constant study . I weighed myself alone ; I balanced myself with others ; I watched every means of information , to see how much ground I occupied as a man and as a poet ; I studied assiduously Nature 's design in my formation — where the lights and shades in my character were intended . I was pretty confident my poems would meet with some applause ; but , at the worst , the roar of the Atlantic would deafen the voice of censure , and the novelty of West Indian scenes make me forget neglect . I threw off six hundred copies , of which I had got subscriptions for about three hundred and fifty .— My vanity was highly gratified by the reception I met with from the public ; and besides I pocketed , all expenses deducted , nearly twenty pounds . This sum came very seasonably , as I was thinking of indenting myself , for want of money to procure my passage . As soon as I was master of nine guineas , the price of wafting me to the torrid zone , I took a steerage passage in the first ship that was to sail from the Clyde , for</p>
   <p>“ Hungry ruin had me in the wind . ”</p>
   <p>I had been for some days skulking from covert to covert , under all the terrors of a jail ; as some ill-advised people had uncoupled the merciless pack of the law at my heels . I had taken the last farewell of my few friends ; my chest was on the road to Greenock ; I had composed the last song I should ever measure in Caledonia — “ The gloomy night is gathering fast , ” when a letter from Dr. Blacklock to a friend of mine , overthrew all my schemes , by opening new prospects to my poetic ambition . The doctor belonged to a set of critics for whose applause I had not dared to hope . His opinion , that I would meet with encouragement in Edinburgh for a second edition , fired me so much , that away I posted for that city , without a single acquaintance , or a single letter of introduction . The baneful star that had so long shed its blasting influence in my zenith , for once made a revolution to the nadir ; and a kind Providence placed me under the patronage of one of the noblest of men , the Earl of Glencairn . Oublie-moi , grand Dieu , si jamais je l'oublie !</p>
   <p>I need relate no farther . At Edinburgh I was in a new world ; I mingled among many classes of men , but all of them new to me , and I was all attention to “ catch ” the characters and “ the manners living as they rise . ” Whether I have profited , time will show .</p>
   <p>My most respectful compliments to Miss Williams . Her very elegant and friendly letter I cannot answer at present , as my presence is requisite in Edinburgh , and I set out to-morrow .</p>

   <p>From henceforth , my dear Sir , I am determined to set off with my letters like the periodical writers , viz . prefix a kind of text , quoted from some classic of undoubted authority , such as the author of the immortal piece , of which my text is part . What I have to say on my text is exhausted in a letter which I wrote you the other day , before I had the pleasure of receiving yours from Inverkeithing ; and sure never was anything more lucky , as I have but the time to write this , that Mr. Nicol , on the opposite side of the table , takes to correct a proof-sheet of a thesis . They are gabbling Latin so loud that I cannot hear what my own soul is saying in my own skull , so I must just give you a matter-of-fact sentence or two , and end , if time permit , with a verse de rei generatione .

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I intended to have written you from Edinburgh , and now write you from Stirling to make an excuse . Here am I , on my way to Inverness , with a truly original , but very worthy man , a Mr. Nicol , one of the masters of the High-school , in Edinburgh . I left Auld Reekie yesterday morning , and have passed , besides by-excursions , Linlithgow , Borrowstouness , Falkirk , and here am I undoubtedly . This morning I knelt at the tomb of Sir John the Graham , the gallant friend of the immortal Wallace ; and two hours ago I said a fervent prayer , for Old Caledonia , over the hole in a blue whinstone , where Robert de Bruce fixed his royal standard on the banks of Bannockburn ; and just now , from Stirling Castle , I have seen by the setting sun the glorious prospect of the windings of Forth through the rich carse of Stirling , and skirting the equally rich carse of Falkirk . The crops are very strong , but so very late , that there is no harvest , except a ridge or two perhaps in ten miles , all the way I have travelled from Edinburgh .</p>
   <p>I left Andrew Bruce and family all well . I will be at least three weeks in making my tour , as I shall return by the coast , and have many people to call for .</p>
   <p>My best compliments to Charles , our dear kinsman and fellow-saint ; and Messrs. W. and H. Parkers . I hope Hughoc is going on and prospering with God and Miss M'Causlin .</p>
   <p>If I could think on anything sprightly , I should let you hear every other post ; but a dull , matter-of-fact business , like this scrawl , the less and seldomer one writes , the better .</p>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>MY DEAR SIR ,</head>
    <head>Here am I on my way to Inverness . I have rambled over the rich , fertile carses of Falkirk and Sterling , and am delighted with their appearance : richly waving crops of wheat , barley , &amp; c ., but no harvest at all yet , except , in one or two places , an old wife 's ridge . Yesterday morning I rode from this town up the meandering Devon 's banks , to pay my respects to some Ayrshire folks at Harvieston . After breakfast , we made a party to go and see the famous Caudron-linn , a remarkable cascade in the Devon , about five miles above Harvieston ; and after spending one of the most pleasant days I ever had in my life , I returned to Stirling in the evening . They are a family , Sir , though I had not any prior tie ; though they had not been the brother and sisters of a certain generous friend of mine , I would never forget them . I am told you have not seen them these several years , so you can have very little idea of what these young folks are now . Your brother is as tall as you are , but slender rather than otherwise ; and I have the satisfaction to inform you that he is getting the better of those consumptive symptoms which I suppose you know were threatening him . His make , and particularly his manner , resemble you , but he will still have a finer face . ( I put in the word still to please Mrs . Hamilton . ) Good sense , modesty , and at the same time a just idea of that respect that man owes to man , and has a right in his turn to exact , are striking features in his character ; and , what with me is the Alpha and the Omega , he has a heart that might adorn the breast of a poet ! Grace has a good figure , and the look of health and cheerfulness , but nothing else remarkable in her person . I scarcely ever saw so striking a likeness as is between her and your little Beenie ; the mouth and chin particularly . She is reserved at first ; but as we grew better acquainted , I was delighted with the native frankness of her manner , and the sterling sense of her observation . Of Charlotte I cannot speak in common terms of admiration : she is not only beautiful but lovely . Her form is elegant ; her features not regular , but they have the smile of sweetness and the settled complacency of good nature in the highest degree : and her complexion , now that she has happily recovered her wonted health , is equal to Miss Burnet 's . After the exercise of our riding to the Falls , Charlotte was exactly Dr. Donne 's mistress :—</head>

     <l n="4">Her eyes are fascinating ; at once expressive of good sense ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>I do not give you all this account , my good Sir , to flatter you . I mean it to reproach you . Such relations the first peer in the realm might own with pride ; then why do you not keep up more correspondence with these so amiable young folks ? I had a thousand questions to answer about you . I had to describe the little ones with the minuteness of anatomy . They were highly delighted when I told them that John was so good a boy , and so fine a scholar , and that Willie was going on still very pretty ; but I have it in commission to tell her from them that beauty is a poor silly bauble without she be good . Miss Chalmers I had left in Edinburgh , but I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Chalmers , only Lady Mackenzie being rather a little alarmingly ill of a sore throat somewhat marred our enjoyment .</p>
   <p>I shall not be in Ayrshire for four weeks . My most respectful compliments to Mrs. Hamilton , Miss Kennedy , and Doctor Mackenzie . I shall probably write him from some stage or other .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have just time to write the foregoing ,<span corresp="#note178" type="note_anchor">[ 178 ]</span>and to tell you that it was ( at least most part of it ) the effusion of an half-hour I spent at Bruar . I do not mean it was extempore , for I have endeavoured to brush it up as well as Mr. Nicol 's chat and the jogging of the chaise would allow . It eases my heart a good deal , as rhyme is the coin with which a poet pays his debts of honour or gratitude . What I owe to the noble family of Athol , of the first kind , I shall ever proudly boast ; what I owe of the last , so help me God in my hour of need ! I shall never forget .</p>
   <p>The “ little angel-band ! ” I declare I prayed for them very sincerely to-day at the Fall of Fyers . I shall never forget the fine family-piece I saw at Blair ; the amiable , the truly noble duchess , with her smiling little seraph in her lap , at the head of the table ; the lovely “ olive plants , ” as the Hebrew bard finely says , round the happy mother : the beautiful Mrs. G ——; the lovely sweet Miss C ., &amp; c. I wish I had the powers of Guido to do them justice ! My Lord Duke 's kind hospitality — markedly kind indeed . Mr. Graham of Fintray 's charms of conversation — Sir W. Murray 's friendship . In short , the recollection of all that polite , agreeable company raises an honest glow in my bosom .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR BROTHER ,</p>
   <p>I arrived here safe yesterday evening , after a tour of twenty-two days , and travelling near six hundred miles , windings included . My farthest stretch was about ten miles beyond Inverness . I went through the heart of the Highlands by Crieff , Taymouth , the famous seat of Lord Breadalbane , down the Tay , among cascades and druidical circles of stones , to Dunkeld , a seat of the Duke of Athol ; thence across the Tay , and up one of his tributary streams to Blair of Athole , another of the duke 's seats , where I had the honour of spending nearly two days with his grace and family ; thence many miles through a wild country , among cliffs gray with eternal snows and gloomy savage glens , till I crossed Spey and went down the stream through Strathspey , so famous in Scottish music ; Badenoch , &amp; c ., till I reached Grant Castle , where I spent half a day with Sir James Grant and family ; and then crossed the country for Fort George , but called by the way at Cawdor , the ancient seat of Macbeth ; there I saw the identical bed , in which tradition says king Duncan was murdered : lastly , from Fort George to Inverness .</p>
   <p>I returned by the coast , through Nairn , Forres , and so on , to Aberdeen , thence to Stonehive , where James Burness , from Montrose , met me by appointment . I spent two days among our relations , and found our aunts , Jean and Isabel , still alive , and hale old women . John Cairn , though born the same year with our father , walks as vigorously as I can : they have had several letters from his son in New York . William Brand is likewise a stout old fellow ; but further particulars I delay till I see you , which will be in two or three weeks . The rest of my stages are not worth rehearsing : warm as I was from Ossian 's country , where I had seen his very grave , what cared I for fishing-towns or fertile carses ? I slept at the famous Brodie of Brodie 's one night , and dined at Gordon Castle next day , with the duke , duchess and family . I am thinking to cause my old mare to meet me , by means of John Ronald , at Glasgow ; but you shall hear farther from me before I leave Edinburgh . My duty and many compliments from the north to my mother ; and my brotherly compliments to the rest . I have been trying for a berth for William , but am not likely to be successful . Farewell .</p>

    <note>To Margaret Chalmers , the youngest daughter of James Chalmers , Esq ., of Fingland , it is said that Burns confided his affection to Charlotte Hamilton : his letters to Miss Chalmers , like those to Mrs. Dunlop , are distinguished for their good sense and delicacy as well as freedom .</note>
     <l n="1">Sept. 26 , 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I send Charlotte the first number of the songs ; I would not wait for the second number ; I hate delays in little marks of friendship , as I hate dissimulation in the language of the heart . I am determined to pay Charlotte a poetic compliment , if I could hit on some glorious old Scotch air , in number second .<span corresp="#note179" type="note_anchor">[ 179 ]</span>You will see a small attempt on a shred of paper in the book : but though Dr. Blacklock commended it very highly , I am not just satisfied with it myself . I intend to make it a description of some kind : the whining cant of love , except in real passion , and by a masterly hand , is to me as insufferable as the preaching cant of old Father Smeaton , whig-minister at Kilmaurs . Darts , flames , cupids , loves , graces , and all that farrago , are just a Mauchline * * * * a senseless rabble .</p>
   <p>I got an excellent poetic epistle yesternight from the old , venerable author of “ Tullochgorum , ” “ John of Badenyon , ” &amp; c. I suppose you know he is a clergyman . It is by far the finest poetic compliment I ever got . I will send you a copy of it .</p>
   <p>I go on Thursday or Friday to Dumfries , to wait on Mr. Miller about his farms .— Do tell that to Lady Mackenzie , that she may give me credit for a little wisdom . “ I Wisdom dwell with Prudence . ” What a blessed fire-side ! How happy should I be to pass a winter evening under their venerable roof ! and smoke a pipe of tobacco , or drink water-gruel with them ! What solemn , lengthened , laughter-quashing gravity of phiz ! What sage remarks on the good-for-nothing sons and daughters of indiscretion and folly ! And what frugal lessons , as we straitened the fire-side circle , on the uses of the poker and tongs !</p>
   <p>Miss N. is very well , and begs to be remembered in the old way to you . I used all my eloquence , all the persuasive flourishes of the hand , and heart-melting modulation of periods in my power , to urge her out to Harvieston , but all in vain . My rhetoric seems quite to have lost its effect on the lovely half of mankind . I have seen the day — but that is a “ tale of other years . ” — In my conscience I believe that my heart has been so oft on fire that it is absolutely vitrified . I look on the sex with something like the admiration with which I regard the starry sky in a frosty December night . I admire the beauty of the Creator 's workmanship ; I am charmed with the wild but graceful eccentricity of their motions , and — wish them good night . I mean this with respect to a certain passion dont j'ai eu l'honneur d'être un miserable esclave : as for friendship , you and Charlotte have given me pleasure , permanent pleasure , “ which the world cannot give , nor take away , ” I hope ; and which will outlast the heavens and the earth .</p>

   <p>I have been at Dumfries , and at one visit more shall be decided about a farm in that country . I am rather hopeless in it ; but as my brother is an excellent farmer , and is , besides , an exceedingly prudent , sober man ( qualities which are only a younger brother 's fortune in our family ) , I am determined , if my Dumfries business fail me , to return into partnership with him , and at our leisure take another farm in the neighbourhood .</p>
   <p>I assure you I look for high compliments from you and Charlotte on this very sage instance of my unfathomable , incomprehensible wisdom . Talking of Charlotte , I must tell her that I have , to the best of my power , paid her a poetic compliment , now completed . The air is admirable : true old Highland . It was the tune of a Gaelic song , which an Inverness lady sung me when I was there ; and I was so charmed with it that I begged her to write me a set of it from her singing ; for it had never been set before . I am fixed that it shall go in Johnson 's next number ; so Charlotte and you need not spend your precious time in contradicting me . I wo n't say the poetry is first-rate ; though I am convinced it is very well ; and , what is not always the case with compliments to ladies , it is not only sincere , but just .</p>

    <head>TO JAMES HOY , ESQ .</head>
    <head>GORDON CASTLE</head>
    <note>James Hoy , librarian of Gordon Castle , was , it is said , the gentleman whom his grace of Gordon sent with a message inviting in vain that “ obstinate son of Latin prose , ” Nicol , to stop and enjoy himself .</note>
     <l n="1">Edinburgh , 20th October , 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I will defend my conduct in giving you this trouble , on the best of Christian principles — “ Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , do ye even so unto them . ” — I shall certainly , among my legacies , leave my latest curse to that unlucky predicament which hurried — tore me away from Castle Gordon . May that obstinate son of Latin prose [ Nicol ] be curst to Scotch mile periods , and damned to seven league paragraphs ; while Declension and Conjugation , Gender , Number , and Time , under the ragged banners of Dissonance and Disarrangement , eternally rank against him in hostile array .</p>
   <p>Allow me , Sir , to strengthen the small claim I have to your acquaintance , by the following request . An engraver , James Johnson , in Edinburgh , has , not from mercenary views , but from an honest , Scotch enthusiasm , set about collecting all our native songs and setting them to music ; particularly those that have never been set before . Clarke , the well known musician , presides over the musical arrangement , and Drs . Beattie and Blacklock , Mr. Tytler , of Woodhouselee , and your humble servant to the utmost of his small power , assist in collecting the old poetry , or sometimes for a fine air make a stanza , when it has no words . The brats , too tedious to mention , claim a parental pang from my bardship . I suppose it will appear in Johnson 's second number — the first was published before my acquaintance with him . My request is — “ Cauld Kail in Aberdeen , ” is one intended for this number , and I beg a copy of his Grace of Gordon 's words to it , which you were so kind as to repeat to me . You may be sure we wo n't prefix the author 's name , except you like , though I look on it as no small merit to this work that the names of many of the authors of our old Scotch songs , names almost forgotten , will be inserted .</p>
   <p>I do not well know where to write to you — I rather write at you ; but if you will be so obliging , immediately on receipt of this , as to write me a few lines , I shall perhaps pay you in kind , though not in quality . Johnson 's terms are :— each number a handsome pocket volume , to consist at least of a hundred Scotch songs , with basses for the harpsichord , &amp; c. The price to subscribers 5s . ; to non-subscribers 6s . He will have three numbers I conjecture .</p>

    <note>The songs of “ Tullochgorum , ” and “ John of Badenyon , ” have made the name of Skinner dear to all lovers of Scottish verse : he was a man cheerful and pious , nor did the family talent expire with him : his son became Bishop of Aberdeen .</note>

   <p>REVEREND AND VENERABLE SIR ,</p>
   <p>Accept , in plain dull prose , my most sincere thanks for the best poetical compliment I ever received . I assure you , Sir , as a poet , you have conjured up an airy demon of vanity in my fancy , which the best abilities in your other capacity would be ill able to lay . I regret , and while I live I shall regret , that when I was in the north , I had not the pleasure of paying a younger brother 's dutiful respect to the author of the best Scotch song ever Scotland saw — “ Tullochgorum 's my delight ! ” The world may think slightingly of the craft of song-making , if they please , but , as Job says — “ Oh ! that mine adversary had written a book ! ” — let them try . There is a certain something in the old Scotch songs , a wild happiness of thought and expression , which peculiarly marks them , not only from English songs , but also from the modern efforts of song-wrights in our native manner and language . The only remains of this enchantment , these spells of the imagination , rests with you . Our true brother , Ross of Lochlee , was likewise “ owre cannie ” — a “ wild warlock ” — but now he sings among the “ sons of the morning . ”</p>
   <p>I have often wished , and will certainly endeavour to form a kind of common acquaintance among all the genuine sons of Caledonian song . The world , busy in low prosaic pursuits , may overlook most of us ; but “ reverence thyself . ” The world is not our peers , so we challenge the jury . We can lash that world , and find ourselves a very great source of amusement and happiness independent of that world .</p>
   <p>There is a work going on in Edinburgh , just now , which claims your best assistance . An engraver in this town has set about collecting and publishing all the Scotch songs , with the music , that can be found . Songs in the English language , if by Scotchmen , are admitted , but the music must all be Scotch . Drs . Beattie and Blacklock are lending a hand , and the first musician in town presides over that department . I have been absolutely crazed about it , collecting old stanzas , and every information respecting their origin , authors , &amp; c. &amp; c. This last is but a very fragment business ; but at the end of his second number — the first is already published — a small account will be given of the authors , particularly to preserve those of latter times . Your three songs , “ Tullochgorum , ” “ John of Badenyon , ” and “ Ewie wi ’ the crookit horn , ” go in this second number . I was determined , before I got your letter , to write you , begging that you would let me know where the editions of these pieces may be found , as you would wish them to continue in future times : and if you would be so kind to this undertaking as send any songs , of your own or others , that you would think proper to publish , your name will be inserted among the other authors ,— “ Nill ye , will ye . ” One half of Scotland already give your songs to other authors . Paper is done . I beg to hear from you ; the sooner the better , as I leave Edinburgh in a fortnight or three weeks .—</p>
   <p>I am ,</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I would have wrote you immediately on receipt of your kind letter , but a mixed impulse of gratitude and esteem whispered me that I ought to send you something by way of return . When a poet owes anything , particularly when he is indebted for good offices , the payment that usually recurs to him — the only coin indeed in which he probably is conversant — is rhyme . Johnson sends the books by the fly , as directed , and begs me to enclose his most grateful thanks : my return I intended should have been one or two poetic bagatelles which the world have not seen , or , perhaps , for obvious reasons , cannot see . These I shall send you before I leave Edinburgh . They may make you laugh a little , which , on the whole , is no bad way of spending one 's precious hours and still more precious breath : at any rate , they will be , though a small , yet a very sincere mark of my respectful esteem for a gentleman whose further acquaintance I should look upon as a peculiar obligation .</p>
   <p>The duke 's song , independent totally of his dukeship , charms me . There is I know not what of wild happiness of thought and expression peculiarly beautiful in the old Scottish song style , of which his Grace , old venerable Skinner , the author of “ Tullochgorum , ” &amp; c ., and the late Ross , at Lochlee , of true Scottish poetic memory , are the only modern instances that I recollect , since Ramsay with his contemporaries , and poor Bob Fergusson , went to the world of deathless existence and truly immortal song . The mob of mankind , that many-headed beast , would laugh at so serious a speech about an old song ; but as Job says , “ O that mine adversary had written a book ! ” Those who think that composing a Scotch song is a trifling business — let them try .</p>
   <p>I wish my Lord Duke would pay a proper attention to the Christian admonition — “ Hide not your candle under a bushel , ” but “ let your light shine before men . ” I could name half a dozen dukes that I guess are a devilish deal worse employed : nay , I question if there are half a dozen better : perhaps there are not half that scanty number whom Heaven has favoured with the tuneful , happy , and , I will say , glorious gift .</p>
   <p>I am , dear Sir ,</p>
   <p>Your obliged humble servant ,</p>

   </lg>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>I know your lordship will disapprove of my ideas in a request I am going to make to you ; but I have weighed , long and seriously weighed , my situation , my hopes and turn of mind , and am fully fixed to my scheme if I can possibly effectuate it . I wish to get into the Excise ; I am told that your lordship 's interest will easily procure me the grant from the commissioners ; and your lordship 's patronage and goodness , which have already rescued me from obscurity , wretchedness , and exile , embolden me to ask that interest . You have likewise put it in my power to save the little tie of home that sheltered an aged mother , two brothers , and three sisters from destruction . There , my lord , you have bound me over to the highest gratitude .</p>
   <p>My brother 's farm is but a wretched lease , but I think he will probably weather out the remaining seven years of it ; and after the assistance which I have given and will give him , to keep the family together , I think , by my guess , I shall have rather better than two hundred pounds , and instead of seeking , what is almost impossible at present to find , a farm that I can certainly live by , with so small a stock , I shall lodge this sum in a banking-house , a sacred deposit , expecting only the calls of uncommon distress or necessitous old age .</p>
   <p>These , my lord , are my views : I have resolved from the maturest deliberation ; and now I am fixed , I shall leave no stone unturned to carry my resolve into execution . Your lordship 's patronage is the strength of my hopes ; nor have I yet applied to anybody else . Indeed my heart sinks within me at the idea of applying to any other of the great who have honoured me with their countenance . I am ill qualified to dog the heels of greatness with the impertinence of solicitation , and tremble nearly as much at the thought of the cold promise as the cold denial ; but to your lordship I have not only the honour , the comfort , but the pleasure of being</p>
   <p>Your lordship 's much obliged</p>
   <p>And deeply indebted humble servant ,</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I suppose the devil is so elated with his success with you that he is determined by a coup de main to complete his purposes on you all at once , in making you a poet . I broke open the letter you sent me ; hummed over the rhymes ; and , as I saw they were extempore , said to myself , they were very well ; but when I saw at the bottom a name that I shall ever value with grateful respect , “ I gapit wide , but naething spak . ” I was nearly as much struck as the friends of Job , of affliction-bearing memory , when they sat down with him seven days and seven nights , and spake not a word .</p>
   <p>I am naturally of a superstitious cast , and as soon as my wonder-scared imagination regained its consciousness , and resumed its functions , I cast about what this mania of yours might portend . My foreboding ideas had the wide stretch of possibility ; and several events , great in their magnitude , and important in their consequences , occurred to my fancy . The downfall of the conclave , or the crushing of the Cork rumps ; a ducal coronet to Lord George Gordon and the Protestant interest ; or St. Peter 's keys to * * * * * *.</p>
   <p>You want to know how I come on . I am just in statu quo , or , not to insult a gentleman with my Latin , in “ auld use and wont . ” The noble Earl of Glencairn took me by the hand to-day , and interested himself in my concerns , with a goodness like that benevolent Being , whose image he so richly bears . He is a stronger proof of the immortality of the soul , than any that philosophy ever produced . A mind like his can never die . Let the worshipful squire H. L ., or the reverend Mass J. M. go into their primitive nothing . At best , they are but ill-digested lumps of chaos , only one of them strongly tinged with bituminous particles and sulphureous effluvia . But my noble patron , eternal as the heroic swell of magnanimity , and the generous throb of benevolence , shall look on with princely eye at “ the war of elements , the wreck of matter , and the crush of worlds . ”</p>

It cost me an hour or two of next morning 's sleep , but did not please me ; so it lay by , an ill-digested effort , till the other day that I gave it a critic brush . These kind of subjects are much hackneyed ; and , besides , the wailings of the rhyming tribe over the ashes of the great are cursedly suspicious , and out of all character for sincerity . These ideas damped my muse 's fire ; however , I have done the best I could , and , at all events , it gives me an opportunity of declaring that I have the honour to be , Sir , your obliged humble servant ,</p>

    <note>Some dozen or so , it is said , of the most beautiful letters that Burns ever wrote , and dedicated to the beauty of Charlotte Hamilton , were destroyed by that lady , in a moment when anger was too strong for reflection .</note>
     <l n="1">Edinburgh , Nov. 21 , 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have one vexatious fault to the kindly-welcome , well-filled sheet which I owe to your and Charlotte 's goodness ,— it contains too much sense , sentiment , and good-spelling . It is impossible that even you two , whom I declare to my God I will give credit for any degree of excellence the sex are capable of attaining , it is impossible you can go on to correspond at that rate ; so like those who , Shenstone says , retire because they make a good speech , I shall , after a few letters , hear no more of you . I insist that you shall write whatever comes first : what you see , what you read , what you hear , what you admire , what you dislike , trifles , bagatelles , nonsense ; or to fill up a corner , e'en put down a laugh at full length . Now none of your polite hints about flattery ; I leave that to your lovers , if you have or shall have any ; though , thank heaven , I have found at last two girls who can be luxuriantly happy in their own minds and with one another , without that commonly necessary appendage to female bliss — A LOVER .</p>
   <p>Charlotte and you are just two favourite resting-places for my soul in her wanderings through the weary , thorny wilderness of this world . God knows I am ill-fitted for the struggle : I glory in being a Poet , and I want to be thought a wise man — I would fondly be generous , and I wish to be rich . After all , I am afraid I am a lost subject . “ Some folk hae a hantle o ’ fauts , an ’ I 'm but a ne'erhYpppHeNdohYpppHeNweel . ”</p>
   <p>Afternoon — To close the melancholy reflections at the end of last sheet , I shall just add a piece of devotion commonly known in Carrick by the title of the “ Wabster 's grace : ” —</p>

   <p>I begin this letter in answer to yours of the 17th current , which is not yet cold since I read it . The atmosphere of my soul is vastly clearer than when I wrote you last . For the first time , yesterday I crossed the room on crutches . It would do your heart good to see my hardship , not on my poetic , but on my oaken stilts ; throwing my best leg with an air ! and with as much hilarity in my gait and countenance , as a May frog leaping across the newly harrowed ridge , enjoying the fragrance of the refreshed earth , after the long-expected shower !</p>
   <p>I can n't say I am altogether at my ease when I see anywhere in my path that meagre , squalid , famine-faced spectre , Poverty ; attended as he always is , by iron-fisted oppression , and leering contempt ; but I have sturdily withstood his buffetings many a hard-laboured day already , and still my motto is — I DARE ! My worst enemy is moi-même . I lie so miserably open to the inroads and incursions of a mischievous , light-armed , well-mounted banditti , under the banners of imagination , whim , caprice , and passion : and the heavy-armed veteran regulars of wisdom , prudence , and forethought move so very , very slow , that I am almost in a state of perpetual warfare , and , alas ! frequent defeat . There are just two creatures I would envy , a horse in his wild state traversing the forests of Asia , or an oyster on some of the desert shores of Europe . The one has not a wish without enjoyment , the other has neither wish nor fear .</p>

     <l n="1">Edinburgh , December , 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Mr. Mackenzie , in Mauchline , my very warm and worthy friend , has informed me how much you are pleased to interest yourself in my fate as a man , and ( what to me is incomparably dearer ) my fame as a poet . I have , Sir , in one or two instances , been patronized by those of your character in life , when I was introduced to their notice by * * * * * friends to them and honoured acquaintances to me ! but you are the first gentleman in the country whose benevolence and goodness of heart has interested himself for me , unsolicited and unknown . I am not master enough of the etiquette of these matters to know , nor did I stay to inquire , whether formal duty bade , or cold propriety disallowed , my thanking you in this manner , as I am convinced , from the light in which you kindly view me , that you will do me the justice to believe this letter is not the manoeuvre of the needy , sharping author , fastening on those in upper life , who honour him with a little notice of him or his works . Indeed , the situation of poets is generally such , to a proverb , as may , in some measure , palliate that prostitution of heart and talents , they have at times been guilty of . I do not think prodigality is , by any means , a necessary concomitant of a poetic turn , but I believe a careless indolent attention to economy , is almost inseparable from it ; then there must be in the heart of every bard of Nature 's making , a certain modest sensibility , mixed with a kind of pride , that will ever keep him out of the way of those windfalls of fortune which frequently light on hardy impudence and foot-licking servility . It is not easy to imagine a more helpless state than his whose poetic fancy unfits him for the world , and whose character as a scholar gives him some pretensions to the politesse of life — yet is as poor as I am .</p>
   <p>For my part , I thank Heaven my star has been kinder ; learning never elevated my ideas above the peasant 's shed , and I have an independent fortune at the plough-tail .</p>
   <p>I was surprised to hear that any one who pretended in the least to the manners of the gentleman , should be so foolish , or worse , as to stoop to traduce the morals of such a one as I am , and so inhumanly cruel , too , as to meddle with that late most unfortunate , unhappy part of my story . With a tear of gratitude , I thank you , Sir , for the warmth with which you interposed in behalf of my conduct . I am , I acknowledge , too frequently the sport of whim , caprice , and passion , but reverence to God , and integrity to my fellow-creatures , I hope I shall ever preserve . I have no return , Sir , to make you for your goodness but one — a return which , I am persuaded , will not be unacceptable — the honest , warm wishes of a grateful heart for your happiness , and every one of that lovely flock , who stand to you in a filial relation . If ever calumny aim the poisoned shaft at them , may friendship be by to ward the blow !</p>

    <head>TO MISS WILLIAMS ,</head>
    <head>ON READING HER POEM OF THE SLAVE-TRADE .</head>
    <note>The name and merits of Miss Williams are widely known ; nor is it a small honour to her muse that her tender song of “ Evan Banks ” was imputed to Burns by Cromek : other editors since have continued to include it in his works , though Sir Walter Scott named the true author .</note>
     <l n="1">Edinburgh , Dec. 1787 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I know very little of scientific criticism , so all I can pretend to in that intricate art is merely to note , as I read along , what passages strike me as being uncommonly beautiful , and where the expression seems to be perplexed or faulty .</p>
   <p>The poem opens finely . There are none of these idle prefatory lines which one may skip over before one comes to the subject . Verses 9th and 10th in particular ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Where ocean 's unseen bound</l>
     <l n="2">Leaves a drear world of waters round , ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>are truly beautiful . The simile of the hurricane is likewise fine ; and , indeed , beautiful as the poem is , almost all the similes rise decidedly above it . From verse 31st to verse 50th is a pretty eulogy on Britain . Verse 36th , “ That foul drama deep with wrong , ” is nobly expressive . Verse 46th , I am afraid , is rather unworthy of the rest ; “ to dare to feel ” is an idea that I do not altogether like . The contrast of valour and mercy , from the 36th verse to the 50th , is admirable .</p>
   <p>Either my apprehension is dull , or there is something a little confused in the apostrophe to Mr. Pitt . Verse 55th is the antecedent to verses 57th and 58th , but in verse 58th the connexion seems ungrammatical :—</p>
   <p>“ Powers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . With no gradation mark 'd their flight , But rose at once to glory 's height . ”</p>
   <p>Ris'n should be the word instead of rose . Try it in prose . Powers ,— their flight marked by no gradations , but [ the same powers ] risen at once to the height of glory . Likewise , verse 53d , “ For this , ” is evidently meant to lead on the sense of the verses 59th , 60th , 61st , and 62d : but let us try how the thread of connexion runs ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ For this . . . . . . . . . .</l>
     <l n="2">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</l>
     <l n="3">The deeds of mercy , that embrace</l>
     <l n="4">A distant sphere , an alien race ,</l>
     <l n="5">Shall virtue 's lips record and claim</l>
     <l n="6">The fairest honours of thy name . ”</l>

   <p>I beg pardon if I misapprehended the matter , but this appears to me the only imperfect passage in the poem . The comparison of the sunbeam is fine .</p>
   <p>The compliment to the Duke of Richmond is , I hope , as just as it is certainly elegant The thought ,</p>
   <p>“ Virtue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Sends from her unsullied source , The gems of thought their purest force , ”</p>
   <p>is exceeding beautiful . The idea , from verse 81st to the 85th , that the “ blest decree ” is like the beams of morning ushering in the glorious day of liberty , ought not to pass unnoticed or unapplauded . From verse 85th to verse 108th , is an animated contrast between the unfeeling selfishness of the oppressor on the one hand , and the misery of the captive on the other . Verse 88th might perhaps be amended thus : “ Nor ever quit her narrow maze . ” We are said to pass a bound , but we quit , a maze . Verse 100th is exquisitely beautiful :—</p>
   <p>“ They , whom wasted blessings tire . ”</p>
   <p>Verse 110th is I doubt a clashing of metaphors : “ to load a span ” is , I am afraid , an unwarrantable expression . In verse 114th , “ Cast the universe in shade , ” is a fine idea . From the 115th verse to the 142d is a striking description of the wrongs of the poor African . Verse 120th , “ The load of unremitted pain , ” is a remarkable , strong expression . The address to the advocates for abolishing the slave-trade , from verse 143d to verse 208th , is animated with the true life of genius . The picture of oppression :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ While she links her impious chain ,</l>
     <l n="2">And calculates the price of pain ;</l>
     <l n="3">Weighs agony in sordid scales ,</l>
     <l n="4">And marks if death or life prevails , ” —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">is nobly executed .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>What a tender idea is in verse 108th ! Indeed , that whole description of home may vie with Thomson 's description of home , somewhere in the beginning of his Autumn . I do not remember to have seen a stronger expression of misery than is contained in these verses :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Condemned , severe extreme , to live</l>
     <l n="2">When all is fled that life can give ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The comparison of our distant joys to distant objects is equally</l>
     <l n="4">original and striking .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The character and manners of the dealer in the infernal traffic is a well done though a horrid picture . I am not sure how far introducing the sailor was right ; for though the sailor 's common characteristic is generosity , yet , in this case , he is certainly not only an unconcerned witness , but , in some degree , an efficient agent in the business . Verse 224th is a nervous ... expressive — “ The heart convulsive anguish breaks . ” The description of the captive wretch when he arrives in the West Indies , is carried on with equal spirit . The thought that the oppressor 's sorrow on seeing the slave pine , is like the butcher 's regret when his destined lamb dies a natural death , is exceedingly fine .</p>
   <p>I am got so much into the cant of criticism , that I begin to be afraid lest I have nothing except the cant of it ; and instead of elucidating my author , am only benighting myself . For this reason , I will not pretend to go through the whole poem . Some few remaining beautiful lines , however , I cannot pass over . Verse 280th is the strongest description of selfishness I ever saw . The comparison of verses 285th and 286th is new and fine ; and the line , “ Your arms to penury you lend , ” is excellent . In verse 317th , “ like ” should certainly be “ as ” or “ so ; ” for instance —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ His sway the hardened bosom leads</l>
     <l n="2">To cruelty 's remorseless deeds :</l>
     <l n="3">As ( or , so ) the blue lightning when it springs</l>
     <l n="4">With fury on its livid wings ,</l>
     <l n="5">Darts on the goal with rapid force ,</l>
     <l n="6">Nor heeds that ruin marks its course . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If you insert the word “ like ” where I have placed “ as , ” you must alter “ darts ” to “ darting , ” and “ heeds ” to “ heeding ” in order to make it grammar . A tempest is a favourite subject with the poets , but I do not remember anything even in Thomson 's Winter superior to your verses from the 347th to the 351st . Indeed , the last simile , beginning with “ Fancy may dress , ” &amp; c ., and ending with the 350th verse , is , in my opinion , the most beautiful passage in the poem ; it would do honour to the greatest names that ever graced our profession .</p>
   <p>I will not beg your pardon , Madam , for these strictures , as my conscience tells me , that for once in my life I have acted up to the duties of a Christian , in doing as I would be done by .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have met with few things in life which have given me more pleasure than Fortune 's kindness to you since those days in which we met in the vale of misery ; as I can honestly say , that I never knew a man who more truly deserved it , or to whom my heart more truly wished it . I have been much indebted since that time to your story and sentiments for steeling my mind against evils , of which I have had a pretty decent share . My will-o'wisp fate you know : do you recollect a Sunday we spent together in Eglinton woods ! You told me , on my repeating some verses to you , that you wondered I could resist the temptation of sending verses of such merit to a magazine . It was from this remark I derived that idea of my own pieces , which encouraged me to endeavour at the character of a poet . I am happy to hear that you will be two or three months at home . As soon as a bruised limb will permit me , I shall return to Ayrshire , and we shall meet ; “ and faith , I hope we 'll not sit dumb , nor yet cast out ! ”</p>
   <p>I have much to tell you “ of men , their manners , and their ways , ” perhaps a little of the other sex . Apropos , I beg to be remembered to Mrs. Brown . There I doubt not , my dear friend , but you have found substantial happiness . I expect to find you something of an altered but not a different man ; the wild , bold , generous young fellow composed into the steady affectionate husband , and the fond careful parent . For me , I am just the same will-o ’ - wisp being I used to be . About the first and fourth quarters of the moon , I generally set in for the trade wind of wisdom : but about the full and change , I am the luckless victim of mad tornadoes , which blow me into chaos . Almighty love still reigns and revels in my bosom ; and I am at this moment ready to hang myself for a young Edinburgh widow , who has wit and wisdom more murderously fatal than the assassinating stiletto of the Sicilian banditti , or the poisoned arrow of the savage African . My highland dirk , that used to hang beside my crutches , I have gravely removed into a neighbouring closet , the key of which I cannot command in case of spring-tide paroxysms . You may guess of her wit by the following verses , which she sent me the other day :—</p>

     <l n="1">Talk not of love , it gives me pain ,</l>

    <head>MY DEAR SIR ,</head>
    <head>It is indeed with the highest pleasure that I congratulate you on the return of days of ease and nights of pleasure , after the horrid hours of misery in which I saw you suffering existence when last in Ayrshire ; I seldom pray for any body , “ I 'm baith dead-sweer and wretched ill o't ; ” but most fervently do I beseech the Power that directs the world , that you may live long and be happy , but live no longer than you are happy . It is needless for me to advise you to have a reverend care of your health . I know you will make it a point never at one time to drink more than a pint of wine ( I mean an English pint ) , and that you will never be witness to more than one bowl of punch at a time , and that cold drams you will never more taste ; and , above all things , I am convinced , that after drinking perhaps boiling punch , you will never mount your horse and gallop home in a chill late hour . Above all things , as I understand you are in habits of intimacy with that Boanerges of gospel powers , Father Auld , be earnest with him that he will wrestle in prayer for you , that you may see the vanity of vanities in trusting to , or even practising the casual moral works of charity , humanity , generosity , and forgiveness of things , which you practised so flagrantly that it was evident you delighted in them , neglecting , or perhaps profanely despising , the wholesome doctrine of faith without works , the only anchor of salvation . A hymn of thanksgiving would , in my opinion , be highly becoming from you at present , and in my zeal for your well-being , I earnestly press on you to be diligent in chanting over the two enclosed pieces of sacred poesy .

   <p>MY DEAR MADAM ,</p>
   <p>I just now have read yours . The poetic compliments I pay cannot be misunderstood . They are neither of them so particular as to point you out to the world at large ; and the circle of your acquaintances will allow all I have said . Besides , I have complimented you chiefly , almost solely , on your mental charms . Shall I be plain with you ? I will ; so look to it . Personal attractions , Madam , you have much above par ; wit , understanding , and worth , you possess in the first class . This is a cursed flat way of telling you these truths , but let me hear no more of your sheepish timidity . I know the world a little . I know what they will say of my poems ; by second sight I suppose ; for I am seldom out in my conjectures ; and you may believe me , my dear Madam , I would not run any risk of hurting you by any ill-judged compliment . I wish to show to the world , the odds between a poet 's friends and those of simple prosemen . More for your information , both the pieces go in . One of them , “ Where braving angry winter 's storms , ” is already set — the tune is Neil Gow 's Lamentation for Abercarny ; the other is to be set to an old Highland air in Daniel Dow 's collection of ancient Scots music ; the name is “ Ha a Chaillich air mo Dheith . ” My treacherous memory has forgot every circumstance about Les Incas , only I think you mentioned them as being in Creech 's possession . I shall ask him about it . I am afraid the song of “ Somebody ” will come too late — as I shall , for certain , leave town in a week for Ayrshire , and from that to Dumfries , but there my hopes are slender . I leave my direction in town , so anything , wherever I am , will reach me .</p>
   <p>I saw yours to ——; it is not too severe , nor did he take it amiss . On the contrary , like a whipt spaniel , he talks of being with you in the Christmas days . Mr. —— has given him the invitation , and he is determined to accept of it . O selfishness ! he owns , in his sober moments , that from his own volatility of inclination , the circumstances in which he is situated , and his knowledge of his father 's disposition ;— the whole affair is chimerical — yet he will gratify an idle penchant at the enormous , cruel expense , of perhaps ruining the peace of the very woman for whom he professes the generous passion of love ! He is a gentleman in his mind and manners — tant pis ! He is a volatile school-boy — the heir of a man 's fortune who well knows the value of two times two !</p>
   <p>Perdition seize them and their fortunes , before they should make the amiable , the lovely ——, the derided object of their purse-proud contempt !</p>

   <p>I have been a cripple now near three months , though I am getting vastly better , and have been very much hurried beside , or else I would have wrote you sooner . I must beg your pardon for the epistle you sent me appearing in the Magazine . I had given a copy or two to some of my intimate friends , but did not know of the printing of it till the publication of the Magazine . However , as it does great honour to us both , you will forgive it .</p>
   <p>The second volume of the songs I mentioned to you in my last is published to-day . I send you a copy which I beg you will accept as a mark of the veneration I have long had , and shall ever have , for your character , and of the claim I make to your continued acquaintance . Your songs appear in the third volume , with your name in the index ; as , I assure you , Sir , I have heard your “ Tullochgorum , ” particularly among our west-country folks , given to many different names , and most commonly to the immortal author of “ The Minstrel , ” who , indeed , never wrote anything superior to “ Gie 's a sang , Montgomery cried . ” Your brother has promised me your verses to the Marquis of Huntley 's reel , which certainly deserve a place in the collection . My kind host , Mr. Cruikshank , of the High-school here , and said to be one of the best Latins in this age , begs me to make you his grateful acknowledgments for the entertainment he has got in a Latin publication of yours , that I borrowed for him from your acquaintance and much respected friend in this place , the Reverend Dr. Webster . Mr. Cruikshank maintains that you write the best Latin since Buchanan . I leave Edinburgh to-morrow , but shall return in three weeks . Your song you mentioned in your last , to the tune of “ Dumbarton Drums , ” and the other , which you say was done by a brother by trade of mine , a ploughman , I shall thank you much for a copy of each . I am ever , Reverend Sir , with the most respectful esteem and sincere veneration , yours ,</p>

    <head>MADAM ,</head>
    <head>You are much indebted to some indispensable business I have had on my hands , otherwise my gratitude threatened such a return for your obliging favour as would have tired your patience . It but poorly expresses my feelings to say , that I am sensible of your kindness : it may be said of hearts such as yours is , and such , I hope , mine is , much more justly than Addison applies it ,—</head>
     <l n="1">“ Some souls by instinct to each other turn . ”</l>

   <p>There was something in my reception at Kilravock so different from the cold , obsequious , dancing-school bow of politeness , that it almost got into my head that friendship had occupied her ground without the intermediate march of acquaintance . I wish I could transcribe , or rather transfuse into language , the glow of my heart when I read your letter . My ready fancy , with colours more mellow than life itself , painted the beautifully wild scenery of Kilravock — the venerable grandeur of the castle — the spreading woods — the winding river , gladly leaving his unsightly , heathy source , and lingering with apparent delight as he passes the fairy walk at the bottom of the garden ;— your late distressful anxieties — your present enjoyments — your dear little angel , the pride of your hopes ;— my aged friend , venerable in worth and years , whose loyalty and other virtues will strongly entitle her to the support of the Almighty Spirit here , and his peculiar favour in a happier state of existence . You cannot imagine , Madam , how much such feelings delight me ; they are my dearest proofs of my own immortality . Should I never revisit the north , as probably I never will , nor again see your hospitable mansion , were I , some twenty years hence , to see your little fellow 's name making a proper figure in a newspaper paragraph , my heart would bound with pleasure .</p>
   <p>I am assisting a friend in a collection of Scottish songs , set to their proper tunes ; every air worth preserving is to be included : among others I have given “ Morag , ” and some few Highland airs which pleased me most , a dress which will be more generally known , though far , far inferior in real merit . As a small mark of my grateful esteem , I beg leave to present you with a copy of the work , as far as it is printed ; the Man of Feeling , that first of men , has promised to transmit it by the first opportunity .</p>
   <p>I beg to be remembered most respectfully to my venerable friend , and to your little Highland chieftain . When you see the “ two fair spirits of the hill , ” at Kildrummie ,<span corresp="#note181" type="note_anchor">[ 181 ]</span>tell them that I have done myself the honour of setting myself down as one of their admirers for at least twenty years to come , consequently they must look upon me as an acquaintance for the same period ; but , as the apostle Paul says , “ this I ask of grace , not of debt . ”</p>

There is a time of life beyond which we cannot form a tie worth the name of friendship . “ O youth ! enchanting stage , profusely blest . ” Life is a fairy scene : almost all that deserves the name of enjoyment or pleasure is only a charming delusion ; and in comes repining age in all the gravity of hoary wisdom , and wretchedly chases away the bewitching phantom . When I think of life , I resolve to keep a strict look-out in the course of economy , for the sake of worldly convenience and independence of mind ; to cultivate intimacy with a few of the companions of youth , that they may be the friends of age ; never to refuse my liquorish humour a handful of the sweetmeats of life , when they come not too dear ; and , for futurity ,—</head>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>Apologies for not writing are frequently like apologies for not singing — the apology better than the song . I have fought my way severely through the savage hospitality of this country , to send every guest drunk to bed if they can .</p>
   <p>I executed your commission in Glasgow , and I hope the cocoa came safe . ‘ Twas the same price and the very same kind as your former parcel , for the gentleman recollected your buying there perfectly well .</p>
   <p>I should return my thanks for your hospitality ( I leave a blank for the epithet , as I know none can do it justice ) to a poor , wayfaring bard , who was spent and utmost overpowered fighting with prosaic wickednesses in high places ; but I am afraid lest you should burn the letter whenever you come to the passage , so I pass over it in silence . I am just returned from visiting Mr. Miller 's farm . The friend whom I told you I would take with me was highly pleased with the farm ; and as he is , without exception , the most intelligent farmer in the country , he has staggered me a good deal . I have the two plans of life before me ; I shall balance them to the best of my judgment , and fix on the most eligible . I have written Mr. Miller , and shall wait on him when I come to town , which shall be the beginning or middle of next week ; I would be in sooner , but my unlucky knee is rather worse , and I fear for some time will scarcely stand the fatigue of my Excise instructions . I only mention these ideas to you ; and , indeed , except Mr. Ainslie , whom I intend writing to to-morrow , I will not write at all to Edinburgh till I return to it . I would send my compliments to Mr. Nicol , but he would be hurt if he knew I wrote to anybody and not to him : so I shall only beg my best , kindest , kindest compliments to my worthy hostess and the sweet little rose-bud .</p>
   <p>So soon as I am settled in the routine of life , either as an Excise-officer , or as a farmer , I propose myself great pleasure from a regular correspondence with the only man almost I ever saw who joined the most attentive prudence with the warmest generosity .</p>
   <p>I am much interested for that best of men , Mr. Wood ; I hope he is in better health and spirits than when I saw him last .</p>
   <p>I am ever ,</p>
   <p>My dearest friend ,</p>
   <p>Your obliged , humble servant ,</p>

   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>I am just returned from Mr. Miller 's farm . My old friend whom I took with me was highly pleased with the bargain , and advised me to accept of it . He is the most intelligent sensible farmer in the county , and his advice has staggered me a good deal . I have the two plans before me : I shall endeavour to balance them to the best of my judgement , and fix on the most eligible . On the whole , if I find Mr. Miller in the same favourable disposition as when I saw him last , I shall in all probability turn farmer .</p>
   <p>I have been through sore tribulation and under much buffeting of the wicked one since I came to this country . Jean I found banished , forlorn , destitute and friendless : I have reconciled her to her fate , and I have reconciled her to her mother .</p>
   <p>I shall be in Edinburgh middle of next week . My farming ideas I shall keep private till I see . I got a letter from Clarinda yesterday , and she tells me she has got no letter of mine but one . Tell her that I wrote to her from Glasgow , from Kilmarnock , from Mauchline , and yesterday from Cumnock as I returned from Dumfries . Indeed she is the only person in Edinburgh I have written to till this day . How are your soul and body putting up ?— a little like man and wife , I suppose .</p>

   <p>I have been out of the country , my dear friend , and have not had an opportunity of writing till now , when I am afraid you will be gone out of the country too . I have been looking at farms , and , after all , perhaps I may settle in the character of a farmer . I have got so vicious a bent to idleness , and have ever been so little a man of business , that it will take no ordinary effort to bring my mind properly into the routine : but you will save a “ great effort is worthy of you . ” I say so myself ; and butter up my vanity with all the stimulating compliments I can think of . Men of grave , geometrical minds , the sons of “ which was to be demonstrated , ” may cry up reason as much as they please ; but I have always found an honest passion , or native instinct , the truest auxiliary in the warfare of this world . Reason almost always comes to me like an unlucky wife to a poor devil of a husband , just in sufficient time to add her reproaches to his other grievances .</p>
   <p>I am gratified with your kind inquiries after Jean ; as , after all , I may say with Othello :—</p>

    <head>DEAR SIR ,</head>
    <head>I have partly changed my ideas , my dear friend , since I saw you . I took old Glenconner with mo to Mr. Miller 's farm , and he was so pleased with it , that I have wrote an offer to Mr. Miller , which , if he accepts , I shall sit down a plain farmer , the happiest of lives when a man can live by it . In this case I shall not stay in Edinburgh above a week . I set out on Monday , and would have come by Kilmarnock , but there are several small sums owing me for my first edition about Galston and Newmills , and I shall set off so early as to dispatch my business , and reach Glasgow by night . When I return , I shall devote a forenoon or two to make some kind of acknowledgment for all the kindness I owe your friendship . Now that I hope to settle with some credit and comfort at home , there was not any friendship or friendly correspondence that promised me more pleasure than yours ; I hope I will not be disappointed . I trust the spring will renew your shattered frame , and make your friends happy . You and I have often agreed that life is no great blessing on the whole . The close of life , indeed , to a reasoning eye , is ,</head>
     <l n="1">“ Dark as was chaos , ere the infant sun</l>
     <l n="2">Was roll 'd together , or had try 'd his beams</l>
     <l n="3">Athwart their gloom profound . "[ 183 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But an honest man has nothing to fear . If we lie down in the grave , the whole man a piece of broken machinery , to moulder with the clods of the valley , be it so : at least there is an end of pain , care , woes , and wants : if that part of us called mind does survive the apparent destruction of the man — away with old-wife prejudices and tales ! Every age and every nation has had a different set of stories ; and as the many are always weak , of consequence , they have often , perhaps always , been deceived ; a man conscious of having acted an honest part among his fellow-creatures — even granting that he may have been the sport at times of passions and instincts — he goes to a great unknown Being , who could have no other end in giving him existence but to make him happy , who gave him those passions and instincts , and well knows their force .</p>
   <p>These , my worthy friend , are my ideas ; and I know they are not far different from yours . It becomes a man of sense to think for himself , particularly in a case where all men are equally interested , and where , indeed , all men are equally in the dark .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear Sir ; God send us a cheerful meeting !</p>

   </lg>
   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>The last paragraph in yours of the 30th February affected me most , so I shall begin my answer where you ended your letter . That I am often a sinner with any little wit I have , I do confess : but I have taxed my recollection to no purpose , to find out when it was employed against you . I hate an ungenerous sarcasm a great deal worse than I do the devil ; at least as Milton described him ; and though I may be rascally enough to be sometimes guilty of it myself , I cannot endure it in others . You , my honoured friend , who cannot appear in any light but you are sure of being respectable — you can afford to pass by an occasion to display your wit , because you may depend for fame on your sense ; or , if you choose to be silent , you know you can rely on the gratitude of many , and the esteem of all ; but , God help us , who are wits or witlings by profession , if we stand for fame there , we sink unsupported !</p>
   <p>I am highly flattered by the news you tell me of Coila . I may say to the fair painter who does me so much honour , as Dr. Beattie says to Ross the poet of his muse Scota , from which , by the bye , I took the idea of Coila ( ‘ tis a poem of Beattie 's in the Scottish dialect , which perhaps you have never seen :) —</p>

    <note>The uncouth cares of which the poet complains in this letter were the construction of a common farmhouse , with barn , byre , and stable to suit .</note>
     <l n="1">Edinburgh , March 14 , 1788 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I know , my ever dear friend , that you will be pleased with the news when I tell you , I have at last taken a lease of a farm . Yesternight I completed a bargain with Mr. Miller , of Dalswinton for the farm of Ellisland , on the banks of the Nith , between five and six miles above Dumfries . I begin at Whit-Sunday to build a house , drive lime , &amp; c .; and heaven be my help ! for it will take a strong effort to bring my mind into the routine of business . I have discharged all the army of my former pursuits , fancies , and pleasures ; a motley host ! and have literally and strictly retained only the ideas of a few friends , which I have incorporated into a lifeguard . I trust in Dr. Johnson 's observation , “ Where much is attempted , something is done . ” Firmness , both in sufferance and exertion , is a character I would wish to be thought to possess : and have always despised the whining yelp of complaint , and the cowardly , feeble resolve .</p>
   <p>Poor Miss K. is ailing a good deal this winter , and begged me to remember her to you the first time I wrote to you . Surely woman , amiable woman , is often made in vain . Too delicately formed for the rougher pursuits of ambition ; too noble for the dirt of avarice , and even too gentle for the rage of pleasure ; formed indeed for , and highly susceptible of enjoyment and rapture ; but that enjoyment , alas ! almost wholly at the mercy of the caprice , malevolence , stupidity , or wickedness of an animal at all times comparatively unfeeling , and often brutal .</p>

   <p>I am monstrously to blame , my dear Sir , in not writing to you , and sending you the Directory . I have been getting my tack extended , as I have taken a farm ; and I have been racking shop accounts with Mr. Creech , both of which , together with watching , fatigue , and a load of care almost too heavy for my shoulders , have in some degree actually fevered me . I really forgot the Directory yesterday , which vexed me ; but I was convulsed with rage a great part of the day . I have to thank you for the ingenious , friendly , and elegant epistle from your friend Mr. Crawford . I shall certainly write to him , but not now . This is merely a card to you , as I am posting to Dumfries-shire , where many perplexing arrangements await me . I am vexed about the Directory ; but , my dear Sir , forgive me : these eight days I have been positively crazed . My compliments to Mrs. B. I shall write to you at Grenada .— I am ever , my dearest friend ,</p>

    <note>Cleghorn was a farmer , a social man , and much of a musician . The poet wrote the Chevalier 's Lament to please the jacobitical taste of his friend ; and the musician gave him advice in farming which he neglected to follow :— “ Farmer Attention , ” says Cleghorn , “ is a good farmer everywhere . ”</note>

   </lg>
   <p>Yesterday , my dear Sir , as I was riding through a track of melancholy , joyless muirs , between Galloway and Ayrshire , it being Sunday , I turned my thoughts to psalms , and hymns , and spiritual songs ; and your favourite air , “ Captain O'Kean , ” coming at length into my head , I tried these words to it . You will see that the first part of the tune must be repeated .</p>
   <p>I am tolerably pleased with these verses , but as I have only a sketch of the tune , I leave it with you to try if they suit the measure of the music .</p>
   <p>I am so harassed with care and anxiety , about this farming project of mine , that my muse has degenerated into the veriest prose-wench that ever picked cinders , or followed a tinker . When I am fairly got into the routine of business , I shall trouble you with a longer epistle ; perhaps with some queries respecting farming ; at present , the world sits such a load on my mind , that it has effaced almost every trace of the poet in me .</p>

   <p>I have not delayed so long to write you , my much respected friend , because I thought no farther of my promise . I have long since give up that kind of formal correspondence , where one sits down irksomely to write a letter , because we think we are in duty bound so to do .</p>
   <p>I have been roving over the country , as the farm I have taken is forty miles from this place , hiring servants and preparing matters ; but most of all I am earnestly busy to bring about a revolution in my own mind . As , till within these eighteen months , I never was the wealthy master of 10 guineas , my knowledge of business is to learn ; add to this my late scenes of idleness and dissipation have enervated my mind to an alarming degree . Skill in the sober science of life is my most serious and hourly study . I have dropt all conversation and all reading ( prose reading ) but what tends in some way or other to my serious aim . Except one worthy young fellow , I have not one single correspondent in Edinburgh . You have indeed kindly made me an offer of that kind . The world of wits , and gens comme il faut which I lately left , and with whom I never again will intimately mix — from that port , Sir , I expect your Gazette : what Les beaux esprit are saying , what they are doing , and what they are singing . Any sober intelligence from my sequestered walks of life ; any droll original ; any passing reward , important forsooth , because it is mine ; any little poetic effort , however embryoth ; these , my dear Sir , are all you have to expect from me . When I talk of poetic efforts , I must have it always understood , that I appeal from your wit and taste to your friendship and good nature . The first would be my favourite tribunal , where I defied censure ; but the last , where I declined justice .</p>
   <p>I have scarcely made a single distich since I saw you . When I meet with an old Scots air that has any facetious idea in its name , I have a peculiar pleasure in following out that idea for a verse or two .</p>
   <p>I trust that this will find you in better health than I did last time I called for you . A few lines from you , directed to me at Mauchline , were it but to let me know how you are , will set my mind a good deal [ at rest . ] Now , never shun the idea of writing me because perhaps you may be out of humour or spirits . I could give you a hundred good consequences attending a dull letter ; one , for example , and the remaining ninety-nine some other time — it will always serve to keep in countenance , my much respected Sir , your obliged friend and humble servant ,</p>

   <p>To-morrow , my dear madam , I leave Edinburgh . I have altered all my plans of future life . A farm that I could live in , I could not find ; and , indeed , after the necessary support my brother and the rest of the family required , I could not venture on farming in that style suitable to my feelings . You will condemn me for the next step I have taken . I have entered into the Excise . I stay in the west about three weeks , and then return to Edinburgh , for six weeks ’ instructions : afterwards , for I get employ instantly , I go où il plait à Dieu ,— et mon Roi . I have chosen this , my dear friend , after mature deliberation . The question is not at what door of fortune 's palace shall we enter in ; but what doors does she open to us ? I was not likely to get anything to do . I wanted un bût , which is a dangerous , an unhappy situation . I got this without any hanging on , or mortifying solicitation ; it is immediate bread , and though poor in comparison of the last eighteen months of my existence , ‘ tis luxury in comparison of all my preceding life : besides , the commissioners are some of them my acquaintances , and all of them my firm friends .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Your powers of reprehension must be great indeed , as I assure you they made my heart ache with penitential pangs , even though I was really not guilty . As I commence farmer at Whit-Sunday , you will easily guess I must be pretty busy ; but that is not all . As I got the offer of the Excise business without solicitation , and as it costs me only six months ’ attendance for instructions , to entitle me to a commission — which commission lies by me , and at any future period , on my simple petition , ca be resumed — I thought five-and-thirty pounds a-year was no bad dernier ressort for a poor poet , if fortune in her jade tricks should kick him down from the little eminence to which she has lately helped him up .</p>
   <p>For this reason , I am at present attending these instructions , to have them completed before Whit-sunday . Still , Madam , I prepared with the sincerest pleasure to meet you at the Mount , and came to my brother 's on Saturday night , to set out on Sunday ; but for some nights preceding I had slept in an apartment , where the force of the winds and rains was only mitigated by being sifted through numberless apertures in the windows , walls , &amp; c. In consequence I was on Sunday , Monday , and part of Tuesday , unable to stir out of bed , with all the miserable effects of a violent cold .</p>
   <p>You see , Madam , the truth of the French maxim , le vrai n'est pas toujours le vraisemblable ; your last was so full of expostulation , and was something so like the language of an offended friend , that I began to tremble for a correspondence , which I had with grateful pleasure set down as one of the greatest enjoyments of my future life .</p>
   <p>Your books have delighted me : Virgil , Dryden , and Tasso were all equally strangers to me ; but of this more at large in my next .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I enclose you one or two more of my bagatelles . If the fervent wishes of honest gratitude have any influence with that great unknown being who frames the chain of causes and events , prosperity and happiness will attend your visits to the continent , and return you safe to your native shore .</p>
   <p>Wherever I am , allow me , Sir , to claim it as my privilege to acquaint you with my progress in my trade of rhymes ; as I am sure I could say it with truth , that next to my little fame , and the having it in my power to make life more comfortable to those whom nature has made dear to me , I shall ever regard your countenance , your patronage , your friendly good offices , as the most valued consequence of my late success in life .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Dryden 's Virgil has delighted me . I do not know whether the critics will agree with me , but the Georgics are to me by far the best of Virgil . It is indeed a species of writing entirely new to me ; and has filled my head with a thousand fancies of emulation : but , alas ! when I read the Georgics , and then survey my own powers , ‘ tis like the idea of a Shetland pony , drawn up by the side of a thorough-bred hunter to start for the plate . I own I am disappointed in the Æneid . Faultless correctness may please , and does highly please , the lettered critic : but to that awful character I have not the most distant pretensions . I do not know whether I do not hazard my pretensions to be a critic of any kind , when I say that I think Virgil , in many instances , a servile copier of Homer . If I had the Odyssey by me , I could parallel many passages where Virgil has evidently copied , but by no means improved , Homer . Nor can I think there is anything of this owing to the translators ; for , from everything I have seen of Dryden , I think him in genius and fluency of language , Pope 's master . I have not perused Tasso enough to form an opinion : in some future letter , you shall have my ideas of him ; though I am conscious my criticisms must be very inaccurate and imperfect , as there I have ever felt and lamented my want of learning most .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>I am two kind letters in your debt , but I have been from home , and horribly busy , buying and preparing for my farming business , over and above the plague of my Excise instructions , which this week will finish .</p>
   <p>As I flatter my wishes that I foresee many future years ’ correspondence between us , ‘ tis foolish to talk of excusing dull epistles ; a dull letter may be a very kind one . I have the pleasure to tell you that I have been extremely fortunate in all my buyings , and bargainings hitherto ; Mrs. Burns not excepted ; which title I now avow to the world . I am truly pleased with this last affair : it has indeed added to my anxieties for futurity , but it has given a stability to my mind , and resolutions unknown before ; and the poor girl has the most sacred enthusiasm of attachment to me , and has not a wish but to gratify my every idea of her deportment . I am interrupted .— Farewell ! my dear Sir .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>I have been torturing my philosophy to no purpose , to account for that kind partiality of yours , which has followed me , in my return to the shade of life , with assiduous benevolence . Often did I regret , in the fleeting hours of my late will-o ’ - wisp appearance , that “ here I had no continuing city ; ” and but for the consolation of a few solid guineas , could almost lament the time that a momentary acquaintance with wealth and splendour put me so much out of conceit with the sworn companions of my road through life — insignificance and poverty .</p>
   <p>There are few circumstances relating to the unequal distribution of the good things of this life that give me more vexation ( I mean in what I see around me ) than the importance the opulent bestow on their trifling family affairs , compared with the very same things on the contracted scale of a cottage . Last afternoon I had the honour to spend an hour or two at a good woman 's fireside , where the planks that composed the floor were decorated with a splendid carpet , and the gay table sparkled with silver and china . ‘ Tis now about term-day , and there has been a revolution among those creatures , who though in appearance partakers , and equally noble partakers , of the same nature with Madame , are from time to time — their nerves , their sinews , their health , strength , wisdom , experience , genius , time , nay a good part of their very thoughts — sold for months and years , not only to the necessities , the conveniences , but , the caprices of the important few . We talked of the insignificant creatures , nay notwithstanding their general stupidity and rascality , did some of the poor devils the honour to commend them . But light be the turf upon his breast who taught “ Reverence thyself ! ” We looked down on the unpolished wretches , their impertinent wives and clouterly brats , as the lordly bull does on the little dirty ant-hill , whose puny inhabitants he crushes in the carelessness of his ramble , or tosses in the air in the wantonness of his pride .</p>

    <head>This is the second day , my honoured friend , that I have been on my farm . A solitary inmate of an old smoky spense ; far from every object I love , or by whom I am beloved ; nor any acquaintance older than yesterday , except Jenny Geddes , the old mare I ride on ; while uncouth cares and novel plans hourly insult my awkward ignorance and bashful inexperience . There is a foggy atmosphere native to my soul in the hour of care ; consequently the dreary objects seem larger than life . Extreme sensibility , irritated and prejudiced on the gloomy side by a series of misfortunes and disappointments , at that period of my existence when the soul is laying in her cargo of ideas for the voyage of life , is , I believe , the principal cause of this unhappy frame of mind .</head>

   <p>To jealousy or infidelity I am an equal stranger . My preservative from the first is the most thorough consciousness of her sentiments of honour , and her attachment to me : my antidote against the last is my long and deep-rooted affection for her .</p>
   <p>In housewife matters , of aptness to learn and activity to execute , she is eminently mistress ; and during my absence in Nithsdale , she is regularly and constantly apprentice to my mother and sisters in their dairy and other rural business .</p>
   <p>The muses must not be offended when I tell them , the concerns of my wife and family will , in my mind , always take the pas ; but I assure them their ladyships will ever come next in place .</p>
   <p>You are right that a bachelor state would have insured me more friends ; but from a cause you will easily guess , conscious peace in the enjoyment of my own mind , and unmistrusting confidence in approaching my God , would seldom have been of the number .</p>
   <p>I found a once much-loved and still much-loved female , literally and truly cast out to the mercy of the naked elements ; but I enabled her to purchase a shelter ;— there is no sporting with a fellow-creature 's happiness or misery .</p>
   <p>The most placid good-nature and sweetness of disposition ; a warm heart , gratefully devoted with all its powers to love me ; vigorous health and sprightly cheerfulness , set off to the best advantage by a more than commonly handsome figure ; these , I think , in a woman , may make a good wife , though she should never have read a page but the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament , nor have danced in a brighter assembly than a penny pay-wedding .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>This is now the third day , my dearest Sir , that I have sojourned in these regions ; and during these three days you have occupied more of my thoughts than in three weeks preceding : in Ayrshire I have several variations of friendship 's compass , here it points invariably to the pole . My farm gives me a good many uncouth cares and anxieties , but I hate the language of complaint . Job , or some one of his friends , says well — “ why should a living man complain ? ”</p>
   <p>I have lately been much mortified with contemplating an unlucky imperfection in the very framing and construction of my soul ; namely , a blundering inaccuracy of her olfactory organs in hitting the scent of craft or design in my fellow-creatures . I do not mean any compliment to my ingenuousness , or to hint that the defect is in consequence of the unsuspicious simplicity of conscious truth or honour : I take it to be , in some , why or other , an imperfection in the mental sight ; or , metaphor apart , some modification of dulness . In two or three small instances lately , I have been most shamefully out .</p>
   <p>I have all along hitherto , in the warfare of life , been bred to arms among the light-horse — the piquet-guards of fancy : a kind of hussars and Highlanders of the brain ; but I am firmly resolved to sell out of these giddy battalions , who have no ideas of a battle but fighting the foe , or of a siege but storming the town . Cost what it will , I am determined to buy in among the grave squadrons of heavy-armed thought , or the artillery corps of plodding contrivance .</p>
   <p>What books are you reading , or what is the subject of your thoughts , besides the great studies of your profession ? You said something about religion in your last . I do n't exactly remember what it was , as the letter is in Ayrshire ; but I thought it not only prettily said , but nobly thought . You will make a noble fellow if once you were married . I make no reservation of your being well-married : you have so much sense , and knowledge of human nature , that though you may not realize perhaps the ideas of romance , yet you will never be ill-married .</p>
   <p>Were it not for the terrors of my ticklish situation respecting provision for a family of children , I am decidedly of opinion that the step I have taken is vastly for my happiness . As it is I look to the Excise scheme as a certainty of maintenance !— luxury to what either Mrs. Burns or I were born to .</p>

    <note>“ There is a degree of folly , ” says Burns in this letter , “ in talking unnecessarily of one 's private affairs . ” The folly is scarcely less to write about them , and much did the poet and his friend write about their own private affairs as well as those of others .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , June 30th , 1788 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I just now received your brief epistle ; and , to take vengeance on your laziness , I have , you see , taken a long sheet of writing-paper , and have begun at the top of the page , intending to scribble on to the very last corner .</p>
   <p>I am vexed at that affair of the * * *, but dare not enlarge on the subject until you send me your direction , as I suppose that will be altered on your late master and friend 's death . I am concerned for the old fellow 's exit , only as I fear it may be to your disadvantage in any respect — for an old man 's dying , except he has been a very benevolent character , or in some particular situation of life that the welfare of the poor or the helpless depended on him , I think it an event of the most trifling moment in the world . Man is naturally a kind , benevolent animal , but he is dropped into such a needy situation here in this vexatious world , and has such a whoreson hungry , growling , multiplying pack of necessities , appetites , passions , and desires about him , ready to devour him for want of other food ; that in fact he must lay aside his cares for others that he may look properly to himself . You have been imposed upon in paying Mr. Miers for the profile of a Mr. H. I did not mention it in my letter to you , nor did I ever give Mr. Miers any such order . I have no objection to lose the money , but I will not have any such profile in my possession .</p>
   <p>I desired the carrier to pay you , but as I mentioned only fifteen shillings to him , I would rather enclose you a guinea note . I have it not , indeed , to spare here , as I am only a sojourner in a strange land in this place ; but in a day or two I return to Mauchline , and there I have the bank-notes through the house like salt permits .</p>
   <p>There is a great degree of folly in talking unnecessarily of one 's private affairs . I have just now been interrupted by one of my new neighbours , who has made himself absolutely contemptible in my eyes , by his silly garrulous pruriency . I know it has been a fault of my own , too ; but from this moment I abjure it , as I would the service of hell ! Your poets , spend-thrifts , and other fools of that kidney , pretend forsooth to crack their jokes on prudence ; but ‘ tis a squalid vagabond glorying in his rags . Still , imprudence respecting money matters is much more pardonable than imprudence respecting character . I have no objection to prefer prodigality to avarice , in some few instances ; but I appeal to your observation , if you have not met , and often met , with the same disingenuousness , the same hollow-hearted insincerity , and disintegritive depravity of principle , in the hackneyed victims of profusion , as in the unfeeling children of parsimony . I have every possible reverence for the much-talked-of world beyond the grave , and I wish that which piety believes , and virtue deserves , may be all matter of fact . But in things belonging to , and terminating in this present scene of existence , man has serious and interesting business on hand . Whether a man shall shake hands with welcome in the distinguished elevation of respect , or shrink from contempt in the abject corner of insignificance ; whether he shall wanton under the tropic of plenty , at least enjoy himself in the comfortable latitudes of easy convenience , or starve in the arctic circle of dreary poverty ; whether he shall rise in the manly consciousness of a self-approving mind , or sink beneath a galling load of regret and remorse — these are alternatives of the last moment .</p>
   <p>You see how I preach . You used occasionally to sermonize too ; I wish you would , in charity , favour me with a sheet full in your own way . I admire the close of a letter Lord Bolingbroke writes to Dean Swift :— “ Adieu dear Swift ! with all thy faults I love thee entirely : make an effort to love me with all mine ! ” Humble servant , and all that trumpery , is now such a prostituted business , that honest friendship , in her sincere way , must have recourse to her primitive , simple ,— farewell !</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I am just going for Nithsdale , else I would certainly have transcribed some of my rhyming things for you . The Miss Baillies I have seen in Edinburgh . “ Fair and lovely are thy works , Lord God Almighty ! Who would not praise thee for these thy gifts in thy goodness to the sons of men ! ” It needed not your fine taste to admire them . I declare , one day I had the honour of dining at Mr. Baillie 's , I was almost in the predicament of the children of Israel , when they could not look on Moses ’ face for the glory that shone in it when he descended from Mount Sinai .</p>
   <p>I did once write a poetic address from the Falls of Bruar to his Grace of Athole , when I was in the Highlands . When you return to Scotland , let me know , and I will send such of my pieces as please myself best . I return to Mauchline in about ten days .</p>
   <p>My compliments to Mr. Purdon . I am in truth , but at present in haste ,</p>
   <p>Yours ,— R. B .</p>
   <p>CXXVII .</p>
   <p>TO MR. PETER HILL .</p>
   <note>Peter Hill was a bookseller in Edinburgh : David Ramsay , printer of the Evening Courant : William Dunbar , an advocate , and president of a club of Edinburgh wits ; and Alexander Cunningham , a jeweller , who loved mirth and wine .</note>
   <p>MY DEAR HILL ,</p>
   <p>I shall say nothing to your mad present — you have so long and often been of important service to me , and I suppose you mean to go on conferring obligations until I shall not be able to lift up my face before you . In the mean time , as Sir Roger de Coverley , because it happened to be a cold day in which he made his will , ordered his servants great coats for mourning , so , because I have been this week plagued with an indigestion , I have sent you by the carrier a fine old ewe-milk cheese .</p>
   <p>Indigestion is the devil : nay , ‘ tis the devil and all . It besets a man in every one of his senses . I lose my appetite at the sight of successful knavery , and sicken to loathing at the noise and nonsense of self-important folly . When the hollow-hearted wretch takes me by the hand , the feeling spoils my dinner : the proud man 's wine so offends my palate that it chokes me in the gullet ; and the pulvilised , feathered , pert coxcomb is so disgustful in my nostril that my stomach turns .</p>
   <p>If ever you have any of these disagreeable sensations , let me prescribe for you patience ; and a bit of my cheese . I know that you are no niggard of your good things among your friends , and some of them are in much need of a slice . There , in my eye is our friend Smellie ; a man positively of the first abilities and greatest strength of mind , as well as one of the best hearts and keenest wits that I have ever met with ; when you see him , as , alas ! he too is smarting at the pinch of distressful circumstances , aggravated by the sneer of contumelious greatness — a bit of my cheese alone will not cure him , but if you add a tankard of brown stout , and superadd a magnum of right Oporto , you will see his sorrows vanish like the morning mist before the summer sun .</p>
   <p>Candlish , the earliest friend , except my only brother , that I have on earth , and one of the worthiest fellows that ever any man called by the name of friend , if a luncheon of my cheese would help to rid him of some of his super-abundant modesty , you would do well to give it him .</p>
   <p>David ,<span corresp="#note184" type="note_anchor">[ 184 ]</span>with his Courant , comes , too , across my recollection , and I beg you will help him largely from the said ewe-milk cheese , to enable him to digest those bedaubing paragraphs with which he is eternally larding the lean characters of certain great men in a certain great town . I grant you the periods are very well turned ; so , a fresh egg is a very good thing , but when thrown at a man in a pillory , it does not at all improve his figure , not to mention the irreparable loss of the egg .</p>
   <p>My facetious friend Dunbar I would wish also to be a partaker : not to digest his spleen , for that he laughs off , but to digest his last night 's wine at the last field-day of the Crochallan corps .<span corresp="#note185" type="note_anchor">[ 185 ]</span></p>
   <p>Among our common friends I must not forget one of the dearest of them — Cunningham . The brutality , insolence , and selfishness of a world unworthy of having such a fellow as he is in it , I know sticks in his stomach , and if you can help him to anything that will make him a little easier on that score , it will be very obliging .</p>
   <p>As to honest J —— S —— e , he is such a contented , happy man , that I know not what can annoy him , except , perhaps , he may not have got the better of a parcel of modest anecdotes which a certain poet gave him one night at supper , the last time the said poet was in town .</p>
   <p>Though I have mentioned so many men of law , I shall have nothing to do with them professedly — the faculty are beyond my prescription . As to their clients , that is another thing ; God knows they have much to digest !</p>
   <p>The clergy I pass by ; their profundity of erudition , and their liberality of sentiment ; their total want of pride , and their detestation of hypocrisy , are so proverbially notorious as to place them far , far above either my praise or censure .</p>
   <p>I was going to mention a man of worth whom I have the honour to call friend , the Laird of Craigdarroch ; but I have spoken to the landlord of the King'shYpppHeNArms inn here , to have at the next county meeting a large ewe-milk cheese on the table , for the benefit of the Dumfries-shire Whigs , to enable them to digest the Duke of Queensberry 's late political conduct .</p>
   <p>I have just this moment an opportunity of a private hand to Edinburgh , as perhaps you would not digest double postage .</p>

   <p>TO ROBERT GRAHAM , ESQ .,</p>
   <p>OF FINTRAY .</p>
   <note>The filial and fraternal claims alluded to in this letter were satisfied with about three hundred pounds , two hundred of which went to his brother Gilbert — a sum which made a sad inroad on the money arising from the second edition of his Poems .</note>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>When I had the honour of being introduced to you at Athole-house , I did not think so soon of asking a favour of you . When Lear , in Shakspeare , asked Old Kent why he wished to be in his service , he answers , “ Because you have that in your face which I would fain call master . ” For some such reason , Sir , do I now solicit your patronage . You know , I dare say , of an application I lately made to your Board to be admitted an officer of Excise . I have , according to form , been examined by a supervisor , and to-day I gave in his certificate , with a request for an order for instructions . In this affair , if I succeed , I am afraid I shall but too much need a patronizing friend . Propriety of conduct as a man , and fidelity and attention as an officer , I dare engage for ; but with anything like business , except manual labour , I am totally unacquainted .</p>
   <p>I had intended to have closed my late appearance on the stage of life , in the character of a country farmer ; but after discharging some filial and fraternal claims , I find I could only fight for existence in that miserable manner , which I have lived to see throw a venerable parent into the jaws of a jail ; whence death , the poor man 's last and often best friend , rescued him .</p>
   <p>I know , Sir , that to need your goodness , is to have a claim on it ; may I , therefore , beg your patronage to forward me in this affair , till I be appointed to a division ; where , by the help of rigid economy , I will try to support that independence so dear to my soul , but which has been too often so distant from my situation .</p>

   <p>I have not room , my dear friend , to answer all the particulars of your last kind letter . I shall be in Edinburgh on some business very soon ; and as I shall be two days , or perhaps three , in town , we shall discuss matters vivâ voce . My knee , I believe , will never be entirely well ; and an unlucky fall this winter has made it still worse . I well remember the circumstance you allude to , respecting Creech 's opinion of Mr. Nicol ; but , as the first gentleman owes me still about fifty pounds , I dare not meddle in the affair .</p>
   <p>It gave me a very heavy heart to read such accounts of the consequence of your quarrel with that puritanic , rotten-hearted , hell-commissioned scoundrel A ——. If , notwithstanding your unprecedented industry in public , and your irreproachable conduct in private life , he still has you so much in his power , what ruin may he not bring on some others I could name ?</p>
   <p>Many and happy returns of seasons to you , with your dearest and worthiest friend , and the lovely little pledge of your happy union . May the great Author of life , and of every enjoyment that can render life delightful , make her that comfortable blessing to you both , which you so ardently wish for , and which , allow me to say , you so well deserve ! Glance over the foregoing verses , and let me have your blots .</p>

   <p>HONOURED MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Your kind letter welcomed me , yesternight , to Ayrshire . I am , indeed , seriously angry with you at the quantum of your luckpenny ; but , vexed and hurt as I was , I could not help laughing very heartily at the noble lord 's apology for the missed napkin .</p>
   <p>I would write you from Nithsdale , and give you my direction there , but I have scarce an opportunity of calling at a post-office once in a fortnight . I am six miles from Dumfries , am scarcely ever in it myself , and , as yet , have little acquaintance in the neighbourhood . Besides , I am now very busy on my farm , building a dwelling-house ; as at present I am almost an evangelical man in Nithsdale , for I have scarce “ where to lay my head . ”</p>
   <p>There are some passages in your last that brought tears in my eyes . “ The heart knoweth its own sorrows , and a stranger intermeddleth not therewith . ” The repository of these “ sorrows of the heart ” is a kind of sanctum sanctorum : and ‘ tis only a chosen friend , and that , too , at particular sacred times , who dares enter into them :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Heaven oft tears the bosom-chords</l>
     <l n="2">That nature finest strung . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You will excuse this quotation for the sake of the author . Instead of entering on this subject farther , I shall transcribe you a few lines I wrote in a hermitage , belonging to a gentleman in my Nithsdale neighbourhood . They are almost the only favours the muses have conferred on me in that country :—</p>
   <p>Thou whom chance may hither lead .<span corresp="#note186" type="note_anchor">[ 186 ]</span></p>
   <p>Since I am in the way of transcribing , the following were the production of yesterday as I jogged through the wild hills of New Cumnock . I intend inserting them , or something like them , in an epistle I am going to write to the gentleman on whose friendship my Excise hopes depend , Mr. Graham , of Fintray , one of the worthiest and most accomplished gentlemen not only of this country , but , I will dare to say it , of this age . The following are just the first crude thoughts “ unhousel 'd , unanointed , unanneal 'd : ” —</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Pity the tuneful muses ’ helpless train ;</l>

     <l n="4">Ah , that “ the friendly e'er should want a friend ! ”</l>
     <l n="5">The little fate bestows they share as soon ;</l>
     <l n="6">Unlike sage , proverb 'd , wisdom 's hard-wrung boon .</l>

    </lg>

   <p>Here the muse left me . I am astonished at what yon tell me of Anthony 's writing me . I never received it . Poor fellow ! you vex me much by telling me that he is unfortunate . I shall be in Ayrshire ten days from this date . I have just room for an old Roman farewell .</p>

    <p>TO MRS. DUNLOP .</p>
    <note>This letter has been often cited , and very properly , as a proof of the strong attachment of Burns to one who was , in many respects , worthy .</note>
     <l n="1">Mauchline , August 10 , 1788 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY MUCH HONOURED FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>Yours of the 24th June is before me . I found it , as well as another valued friend — my wife , waiting to welcome me to Ayrshire : I met both with the sincerest pleasure .</p>
   <p>When I write you , Madam , I do not sit down to answer every paragraph of yours , by echoing every sentiment , like the faithful Commons of Great Britain in Parliament assembled , answering a speech from the best of kings ! I express myself in the fulness of my heart , and may , perhaps , be guilty of neglecting some of your kind inquiries ; but not from your very old reason , that I do not read your letters . All your epistles for several months have cost me nothing , except a swelling throb of gratitude , or a deep-felt sentiment of veneration .</p>
   <p>When Mrs. Burns , Madam , first found herself “ as women wish to be who love their lords , ” as I loved her nearly to distraction , we took steps for a private marriage . Her parents got the hint ; and not only forbade me her company and their house , but , on my rumoured West Indian voyage , got a warrant to put me in jail , till I should find security in my about-to-be paternal relation . You know my lucky reverse of fortune . On my éclatant return to Mauchline , I was made very welcome to visit my girl . The usual consequences began to betray her ; and , as I was at that time laid up a cripple in Edinburgh , she was turned , literally turned out of doors , and I wrote to a friend to shelter her till my return , when our marriage was declared . Her happiness or misery were in my hands , and who could trifle with such a deposit ?</p>
   <p>I can easily fancy a more agreeable companion for my journey of life ; but , upon my honour , I have never seen the individual instance .</p>
   <p>Circumstanced as I am , I could never have got a female partner for life , who could have entered into my favourite studies , relished my favourite authors , &amp; c ., without probably entailing on me at the same time expensive living , fantastic caprice , perhaps apish affectation , with all the other blessed boarding-school acquirements , which ( pardonnez moi , Madame ,) are sometimes to be found among females of the upper ranks , but almost universally pervade the misses of the would-be gentry .</p>
   <p>I like your way in your church-yard lucubrations . Thoughts that are the spontaneous result of accidental situations , either respecting health , place , or company , have often a strength , and always an originality , that would in vain be looked for in fancied circumstances and studied paragraphs . For me , I have often thought of keeping a letter , in progression by me , to send you when the sheet was written out . Now I talk of sheets , I must tell you , my reason for writing to you on paper of this kind is my pruriency of writing to you at large . A page of post is on such a dissocial , narrow-minded scale , that I cannot abide it ; and double letters , at least in my miscellaneous revery manner , are a monstrous tax in a close correspondence .</p>

     <l n="6">“ Why droops my heart with fancied woes forlorn ?</l>
     <l n="7">Why sinks my soul , beneath each wintry sky ? ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>My increasing cares in this , as yet strange country — gloomy conjectures in the dark vista of futurity — consciousness of my own inability for the struggle of the world — my broadened mark to misfortune in a wife and children ;— I could indulge these reflections till my humour should ferment into the most acid chagrin , that would corrode the very thread of life .</p>
   <p>To counterwork these baneful feelings , I have sat down to write to you ; as I declare upon my soul I always find that the most sovereign balm for my wounded spirit .</p>
   <p>I was yesterday at Mr. Miller 's to dinner for the first time . My reception was quite to my mind : from the lady of the house quite flattering . She sometimes hits on a couplet or two , impromptu . She repeated one or two to the admiration of all present . My suffrage as a professional man , was expected : I for once went agonizing over the belly of my conscience . Pardon me , ye my adored household gods , independence of spirit , and integrity of soul ! In the course of conversation , “ Johnson 's Musical Museum , ” a collection of Scottish songs with the music , was talked of . We got a song on the harpsichord , beginning ,</p>
   <p>“ Raving winds around her blowing . "[ 187 ]</p>
   <p>The air was much admired : the lady of the house asked me whose were the words . “ Mine , Madam — they are indeed my very best verses ; ” she took not the smallest notice of them ! The old Scottish proverb says well , “ king 's caff is better than ither folks ’ corn . ” I was going to make a New Testament quotation about “ casting pearls ” but that would be too virulent , for the lady is actually a woman of sense and taste .</p>
   <p>After all that has been said on the other side of the question , man is by no means a happy creature . I do not speak of the selected few , favoured by partial heaven , whose souls are tuned to gladness amid riches and honours , and prudence and wisdom . I speak of the neglected many , whose nerves , whose sinews , whose days are sold to the minions of fortune .</p>
   <p>If I thought you had never seen it , I would transcribe for you a stanza of an old Scottish ballad , called , “ The Life and Age of Man ; ” beginning thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ Twas in the sixteenth hunder year</l>
     <l n="2">Of God and fifty-three ,</l>
     <l n="3">Frae Christ was born , that bought us dear ,</l>
     <l n="4">As writings testifie . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I had an old grand-uncle , with whom my mother lived awhile in her girlish years ; the good old man , for such he was , was long blind ere he died , during which time his highest enjoyment was to sit down and cry , while my mother would sing the simple old song of “ the Life and Age of Man . ”</p>
   <p>It is this way of thinking ; it is these melancholy truths , that make religion so precious to the poor , miserable children of men .— If it is a mere phantom , existing only in the heated imagination of enthusiasm ,</p>
   <p>“ What truth on earth so precious as a lie . ”</p>
   <p>My idle reasonings sometimes make me a little sceptical , but the necessities of my heart always give the cold philosophisings the lie . Who looks for the heart weaned from earth ; the soul affianced to her God ; the correspondent devout thanksgiving , constant as the vicissitudes of even and morn ; who thinks to meet with these in the court , the palace , in the glare of public life ? No : to find them in their precious importance and divine efficacy , we must search among the obscure recesses of disappointment , affliction , poverty , and distress .</p>
   <p>I am sure , dear Madam , you are now more than pleased with the length of my letters . I return to Ayrshire middle of next week : and it quickens my pace to think that there will be a letter from you waiting me there . I must be here again very soon for my harvest .</p>

    <head>MY DEAR SIR ,</head>
    <head>There is not in Edinburgh above the number of the graces whose letters would have given me so much pleasure as yours of the 3d instant , which only reached me yesternight .</head>
    <head>I am here on the farm , busy with my harvest ; but for all that most pleasurable part of life called SOCIAL COMMUNICATION , I am here at the very elbow of existence . The only things that are to be found in this country , in any degree of perfection , are stupidity and canting . Prose they only know in graces , prayers , &amp; c ., and the value of these they estimate as they do their plaiding webs — by the ell ! As for the muses , they have as much an idea of a rhinoceros as of a poet . For my old capricious but good-natured huzzy of a muse —</head>
     <l n="1">“ By banks of Nith I sat and wept</l>
     <l n="2">When Coila I thought on ,</l>
     <l n="3">In midst thereof I hung my harp</l>
     <l n="4">The willow-trees upon . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am generally about half my time in Ayrshire with my “ darling Jean , ” and then I , at lucid intervals , throw my horny fist across my becob-webbed lyre , much in the same manner as an old wife throws her hand across the spokes of her spinning-wheel .</p>
   <p>I will send you the “ Fortunate Shepherdess ” as soon as I return to Ayrshire , for there I keep it with other precious treasure . I shall send it by a careful hand , as I would not for anything it should be mislaid or lost . I do not wish to serve you from any benevolence , or other grave Christian virtue ; ‘ tis purely a selfish gratification of my own feelings whenever I think of you .</p>
   <p>If your better functions would give you leisure to write me , I should be extremely happy ; that is to say if you neither keep nor look for a regular correspondence . I hate the idea of being obliged to write a letter . I sometimes write a friend twice a week , at other times once a quarter .</p>
   <p>I am exceedingly pleased with your fancy in making the author you mention place a map of Iceland instead of his portrait before his works : ‘ twas a glorious idea .</p>
   <p>Could you conveniently do me one thing ?— whenever you finish any head I should like to have a proof copy of it . I might tell you a long story about your fine genius ; but as what everybody knows cannot have escaped you , I shall not say one syllable about it .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Where are you ? and how are you ? and is Lady Mackenzie recovering her health ? for I have had but one solitary letter from you . I will not think you have forgot me , Madam ; and for my part —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ When thee , Jerusalem , I forget ,</l>
     <l n="2">Skill part from my right hand ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ My heart is not of that rock , nor my soul careless as that sea . ” I do not make my progress among mankind as a bowl does among its fellows — rolling through the crowd without bearing away any mark of impression , except where they hit in hostile collision .</p>
   <p>I am here , driven in with my harvest-folks by bad weather ; and as you and your sister once did me the honour of interesting yourselves much à l'égard de moi , I sit down to beg the continuation of your goodness . I can truly say that , all the exterior of life apart , I never saw two , whose esteem flattered the nobler feelings of my soul — I will not say more , but so much as Lady Mackenzie and Miss Chalmers . When I think of you — hearts the best , minds the noblest of human kind — unfortunate even in the shades of life — when I think I have met with you , and have lived more of real life with you in eight days than I can do with almost any body I meet with in eight years — when I think on the improbability of meeting you in this world again — I could sit down and cry like a child ! If ever you honoured me with a place in your esteem , I trust I can now plead more desert . I am secure against that crushing grip of iron poverty , which , alas ! is less or more fatal to the native worth and purity of , I fear , the noblest souls ; and a late important step in my life has kindly taken me out of the way of those ungrateful iniquities , which , however overlooked in fashionable license , or varnished in fashionable phrase , are indeed but lighter and deeper shades of VILLANY .</p>
   <p>Shortly after my last return to Ayrshire , I married “ my Jean . ” This was not in consequence of the attachment of romance , perhaps ; but I had a long and much-loved fellow-creature 's happiness or misery in my determination , and I durst not trifle with so important a deposit . Nor have I any cause to repent it . If I have not got polite tattle , modish manners , and fashionable dress , I am not sickened and disgusted with the multiform curse of boarding-school affectation : and I have got the handsomest figure , the sweetest temper , the soundest constitution , and the kindest heart in the county . Mrs. Burns believes , as firmly as her creed , that I am le plus bel esprit , et le plus honnête homme in the universe ; although she scarcely ever in her life , except the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament , and the Psalms of David in metre , spent five minutes together either on prose or verse . I must except also from this last a certain late publication of Scots poems , which she has perused very devoutly ; and all the ballads in the country , as she has ( O the partial lover ! you will cry ) the finest “ wood-note wild ” I ever heard . I am the more particular in this lady 's character , as I know she will henceforth have the honour of a share in your best wishes . She is still at Mauchline , as I am building my house ; for this hovel that I shelter in , while occasionally here , is pervious to every blast that blows , and every shower that falls ; and I am only preserved from being chilled to death by being suffocated with smoke . I do not find my farm that pennyworth I was taught to expect , but I believe , in time , it may be a saving bargain . You will be pleased to hear that I have laid aside idle éclat , and bind every day after my reapers .</p>
   <p>To save me from that horrid situation of at any time going down in a losing bargain of a farm , to misery , I have taken my Excise instructions , and have my commission in my pocket for any emergency of fortune . If I could set all before your view , whatever disrespect you , in common with the world , have for this business , I know you would approve of my idea .</p>
   <p>I will make no apology , dear Madam , for this egotistic detail ; I know you and your sister will be interested in every circumstance of it . What signify the silly , idle gewgaws of wealth , or the ideal trumpery of greatness ! When fellow-partakers of the same nature fear the same God , have the same benevolence of heart , the same nobleness of soul , the same detestation at everything dishonest , and the same scorn at everything unworthy — if they are not in the dependence of absolute beggary , in the name of common sense are they not EQUALS ? And if the bias , the instinctive bias , of their souls run the same way , why may they not be FRIENDS ?</p>
   <p>When I may have an opportunity of sending you this , Heaven only knows . Shenstone says , “ When one is confined idle within doors by bad weather , the best antidote against ennui is to read the letters of or write to , one 's friends ; ” in that case then , if the weather continues thus , I may scrawl you half a quire .</p>
   <p>I very lately — to wit , since harvest began — wrote a poem , not in imitation , but in the manner , of Pope 's Moral Epistles . It is only a short essay , just to try the strength of my muse 's pinion in that way . I will send you a copy of it , when once I have heard from you . I have likewise been laying the foundation of some pretty large poetic works : how the superstructure will come on , I leave to that great maker and marrer of projects — TIME . Johnson 's collection of Scots songs is going on in the third volume ; and , of consequence , finds me a consumpt for a great deal of idle metre . One of the most tolerable things I have done in that way is two stanzas I made to an air , a musical gentleman of my acquaintance composed for the anniversary of his wedding-day , which happens on the seventh of November . Take it as follows :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The day returns — my bosom burns ,</l>
     <l n="2">The blissful day we twa did meet , ” &amp; c.<span corresp="#note188" type="note_anchor">[ 188 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p>I shall give over this letter for shame . If I should be seized with a scribbling fit , before this goes away , I shall make it another letter ; and then you may allow your patience a week 's respite between the two . I have not room for more than the old , kind , hearty farewell .</p>
   <p>To make some amends , mes chères Mesdames , for dragging you on to this second sheet , and to relieve a little the tiresomeness of my unstudied and uncorrectible prose , I shall transcribe you some of my late poetic bagatelles ; though I have , these eight or ten months , done very little that way . One day in a hermitage on the banks of Nith , belonging to a gentleman in my neighbourhood , who is so good as give me a key at pleasure , I wrote as follows ; supposing myself the sequestered , venerable inhabitant of the lonely mansion .</p>

    <note>Burns had no great respect for critics who found blemishes without perceiving beauties : he expresses his contempt for such in this letter .</note>
     <l n="1">Mauchline , 27th Sept. 1788 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have received twins , dear Madam , more than once ; but scarcely ever with more pleasure than when I received yours of the 12th instant . To make myself understood ; I had wrote to Mr. Graham , enclosing my poem addressed to him , and the same post which favoured me with yours brought me an answer from him . It was dated the very day he had received mine ; and I am quite at a loss to say whether it was most polite or kind .</p>
   <p>Your criticisms , my honoured benefactress , are truly the work of a friend . They are not the blasting depredations of a canker-toothed , caterpillar critic ; nor are they the fair statement of cold impartiality , balancing with unfeeling exactitude the pro and con of an author 's merits ; they are the judicious observations of animated friendship , selecting the beauties of the piece . I have just arrived from Nithsdale , and will be here a fortnight . I was on horseback this morning by three o'clock ; for between my wife and my farm is just forty-six miles . As I jogged on in the dark , I was taken with a poetic fit as follows :</p>
   <p>“ Mrs. Ferguson of Craigdarroch 's lamentation for the death of her son ; an uncommonly promising youth of eighteen or nineteen years of age . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Fate gave the word — the arrow sped ,</l>
     <l n="2">And pierced my darling 's heart . "[ 190 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You will not send me your poetic rambles , but , you see I am no niggard of mine . I am sure your impromptus give me double pleasure ; what falls from your pen can neither be unentertaining in itself , nor indifferent to me .</p>
   <p>The one fault you found , is just ; but I cannot please myself in an emendation .</p>
   <p>What a life of solicitude is the life of a parent ! You interested me much in your young couple .</p>
   <p>I would not take my folio paper for this epistle , and now I repent it . I am so jaded with my dirty long journey that I was afraid to drawl into the essence of dulness with anything larger than a quarto , and so I must leave out another rhyme of this morning 's manufacture .</p>
   <p>I will pay the sapientipotent George , most cheerfully , to hear from you ere I leave Ayrshire .</p>

    <note>“ The ‘ Address to Lochlomond , ’ which this letter criticises , ” says Currie in 1800 , “ was written by a gentleman , now one of the masters of the High-school of Edinburgh , and the same who translated the beautiful story of ‘ The Paria , ’ published in the Bee of Dr. Anderson . ”</note>

   </lg>
   <p>I have been here in this country about three days , and all that time my chief reading has been the “ Address to Lochlomond ” you were so obliging as to send to me . Were I impannelled one of the author 's jury , to determine his criminality respecting the sin of poesy , my verdict should be “ guilty ! a poet of nature 's making ! ” . It is an excellent method for improvement , and what I believe every poet does , to place some favourite classic author in his own walks of study and composition , before him as a model . Though your author had not mentioned the name , I could have , at half a glance , guessed his model to be Thomson . Will my brother-poet forgive me , if I venture to hint that his imitation of that immortal bard is in two or three places rather more servile than such a genius as his required :— e. g .</p>
   <p>“ To soothe the maddening passions all to peace . ”</p>

     <l n="1">“ To soothe the throbbing passions into peace . ”</l>

   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THOMSON .</head>
    <head>I think the “ Address ” is in simplicity , harmony , and elegance of versification , fully equal to the “ Seasons . ” Like Thomson , too , he has looked into nature for himself : you meet with no copied description . One particular criticism I made at first reading ; in no one instance has he said too much . He never flags in his progress , but , like a true poet of nature 's making kindles in his course . His beginning is simple and modest , as if distrustful of the strength of his pinion ; only , I do not altogether like —</head>
     <l n="1">——————————————— -  “ Truth</l>
     <l n="2">The soul of every song that 's nobly great . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Fiction is the soul of many a song that is nobly great . Perhaps I am wrong : this may be but a prose criticism . Is not the phrase in line 7 , page 6 , “ Great lake , ” too much vulgarized by every-day language for so sublime a poem ?</p>
   <p>“ Great mass of waters , theme for nobler song , ”</p>
   <p>is perhaps no emendation . His enumeration of a comparison with other lakes is at once harmonious and poetic . Every reader 's ideas must sweep the</p>
   <p>“ Winding margin of an hundred miles . ”</p>
   <p>The perspective that follows mountains blue — the imprisoned billows beating in vain — the wooded isles — the digression on the yew-tree — “ Ben-lomond 's lofty , cloud-envelop 'd head , ” &amp; c. are beautiful . A thunder-storm is a subject which has been often tried , yet our poet in his grand picture has interjected a circumstance , so far as I know , entirely original :—</p>
   <p>—————————————— -  “ the gloom Deep seam 'd with frequent streaks of moving fire . ”</p>
   <p>In his preface to the Storm , “ the glens how dark between , ” is noble highland landscape ! The “ rain ploughing the red mould , ” too , is beautifully fancied . “ Ben-lomond 's lofty , pathless top , ” is a good expression ; and the surrounding view from it is truly great : the</p>
   <p>———————— -  “ silver mist , Beneath the beaming sun , ”</p>
   <p>is well described ; and here he has contrived to enliven his poem with a little of that passion which bids fair , I think , to usurp the modern muses altogether . I know not how far this episode is a beauty upon the whole , but the swain 's wish to carry “ some faint idea of the vision bright , ” to entertain her “ partial listening ear , ” is a pretty thought . But in my opinion the most beautiful passages in the whole poem are the fowls crowding , in wintry frosts , to Lochlomond 's “ hospitable flood ; ” their wheeling round , their lighting , mixing , diving , &amp; c .; and the glorious description of the sportsman . This last is equal to anything in the “ Seasons . ” The idea of “ the floating tribe distant seen , far glistering to the moon , ” provoking his eye as he is obliged to leave them , is a noble ray of poetic genius . “ The howling winds , ” the “ hideous roar ” of the white cascades , are all in the same style .</p>
   <p>I forget that while I am thus holding forth with the heedless warmth of an enthusiast , I am perhaps tiring you with nonsense . I must , however , mention that the last verse of the sixteenth page is one of the most elegant compliments I have ever seen . I must likewise notice that beautiful paragraph beginning , “ The gleaming lake , ” &amp; c. I dare not go into the particular beauties of the last two paragraphs , but they are admirably fine , and truly Ossianic .</p>
   <p>I must beg your pardon for this lengthened scrawl . I had no idea of it when I began — I should like to know who the author is ; but , whoever he be , please present him with my grateful thanks for the entertainment he has afforded me .</p>
   <p>A friend of mine desired me to commission for him two books , “ Letters on the Religion essential to Man , ” a book you sent me before ; and “ The World unmasked , or the Philosopher the greatest Cheat . ” Send me them by the first opportunity . The Bible you sent me is truly elegant ; I only wish it had been in two volumes .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the opprobrious epithets with which some of our philosophers and gloomy sectarians have branded our nature — the principle of universal selfishness , the proneness to all evil , they have given us ; still the detestation in which inhumanity to the distressed , or insolence to the fallen , are held by all mankind , shows that they are not natives of the human heart . Even the unhappy partner of our kind , who is undone , the bitter consequence of his follies or his crimes , who but sympathizes with the miseries of this ruined profligate brother ? We forget the injuries and feel for the man .</p>
   <p>I went , last Wednesday , to my parish church , most cordially to join in grateful acknowledgment to the AUTHOR OF ALL GOOD , for the consequent blessings of the glorious revolution . To that auspicious event we owe no less than our liberties , civil and religious ; to it we are likewise indebted for the present Royal Family , the ruling features of whose administration have ever been mildness to the subject , and tenderness of his rights .</p>
   <p>Bred and educated in revolution principles , the principles of reason and common sense , it could not be any silly political prejudice which made my heart revolt at the harsh abusive manner in which the reverend gentleman mentioned the House of Stewart , and which , I am afraid , was too much the language of the day . We may rejoice sufficiently in our deliverance from past evils , without cruelly raking up the ashes of those whose misfortune it was , perhaps as much as their crime , to be the authors of those evils ; and we may bless God for all his goodness to us as a nation , without at the same time cursing a few ruined , powerless exiles , who only harboured ideas , and made attempts , that most of us would have done , had we been in their situation .</p>
   <p>“ The bloody and tyrannical House of Stewart ” may be said with propriety and justice , when compared with the present royal family , and the sentiments of our days ; but is there no allowance to be made for the manners of the times ? Were the royal contemporaries of the Stewarts more attentive to their subjects ’ rights ? Might not the epithets of “ bloody and tyrannical ” be , with at least equal justice , applied to the House of Tudor , of York , or any other of their predecessors ?</p>
   <p>The simple state of the case , Sir , seems to be this :— At that period , the science of government , the knowledge of the true relation between king and subject , was , like other sciences and other knowledge , just in its infancy , emerging from dark ages of ignorance and barbarity .</p>
   <p>The Stewarts only contended for prerogatives which they knew their predecessors enjoyed , and which they saw their contemporaries enjoying ; but these prerogatives were inimical to the happiness of a nation and the rights of subjects .</p>
   <p>In the contest between prince and people , the consequence of that light of science which had lately dawned over Europe , the monarch of France , for example , was victorious over the struggling liberties of his people : with us , luckily the monarch failed , and his unwarrantable pretensions fell a sacrifice to our rights and happiness . Whether it was owing to the wisdom of leading individuals , or to the justling of parties , I cannot pretend to determine ; but likewise happily for us , the kingly power was shifted into another branch of the family , who , as they owed the throne solely to the call of a free people , could claim nothing inconsistent with the covenanted terms which placed them there .</p>
   <p>The Stewarts have been condemned and laughed at for the folly and impracticability of their attempts in 1715 and 1745 . That they failed , I bless GOD ; but cannot join in the ridicule against them . Who does not know that the abilities or defects of leaders and commanders are often hidden until put to the touchstone of exigency ; and that there is a caprice of fortune , an omnipotence in particular accidents and conjunctures of circumstances , which exalt us as heroes , or brand us as madmen , just as they are for or against us ?</p>
   <p>Man , Mr . Publisher , is a strange , weak , inconsistent being ; who would believe , Sir , that in this our Augustan age of liberality and refinement , while we seem so justly sensible and jealous of our rights and liberties , and animated with such indignation against the very memory of those who would have subverted them — that a certain people under our national protection should complain , not against our monarch and a few favorite advisers , but against our WHOLE LEGISLATIVE BODY , for similar oppression , and almost in the very same terms , as our forefathers did of the house of Stewart ! I will not , I cannot enter into the merits of the cause ; but I dare say the American Congress , in 1776 , will be allowed to be as able and as enlightened as the English Convention was in 1688 ; and that their posterity will celebrate the centenary of their deliverance from us , as duly and sincerely as we do ours from the oppressive measures of the wrong-headed House of Stewart .</p>
   <p>To conclude , Sir ; let every man who has a tear for the many miseries incident to humanity feel for a family illustrious as any in Europe , and unfortunate beyond historic precedent ; and let every Briton ( and particularly every Scotsman ) who ever looked with reverential pity on the dotage of a parent , cast a veil over the fatal mistakes of the kings of his forefathers .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>I had the very great pleasure of dining at Dunlop yesterday . Men are said to flatter women because they are weak ; if it is so , poets must be weaker still ; for Misses R. and K. and Miss G . M'K ., with their flattering attentions , and artful compliments , absolutely turned my head . I own they did not lard me over as many a poet does his patron , but they so intoxicated me with their sly insinuations and delicate inuendos of compliment , that if it had not been for a lucky recollection , how much additional weight and lustre your good opinion and friendship must give me in that circle , I had certainly looked upon myself as a person of no small consequence . I dare not say one word how much I was charmed with the Major 's friendly welcome , elegant manner , and acute remark , lest I should be thought to overbalance my orientalisms of applause over-against the finest quey<span corresp="#note191" type="note_anchor">[ 191 ]</span>in Ayrshire , which he made me a present of to help and adorn my farm-stock . As it was on hallow-day , I am determined annually , as that day returns , to decorate her horns with an ode of gratitude to the family of Dunlop .</p>
   <p>So soon as I know of your arrival at Dunlop , I will take the first conveniency to dedicate a day , or perhaps two , to you and friendship , under the guarantee of the Major 's hospitality . There will soon be threescore and ten miles of permanent distance between us ; and now that your friendship and friendly correspondence is entwisted with the heart-strings of my enjoyment of life , I must indulge myself in a happy day of “ The feast of reason and the flow of soul . ”</p>

   <p>REVEREND AND DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>As I hear nothing of your motions , but that you are , or were , out of town , I do not know where this may find you , or whether it will find you at all . I wrote you a long letter , dated from the land of matrimony , in June ; but either it had not found you , or , what I dread more , it found you or Mrs. Blacklock in too precarious a state of health and spirits to take notice of an idle packet .</p>
   <p>I have done many little things for Johnson , since I had the pleasure of seeing you ; and I have finished one piece , in the way of Pope 's “ Moral Epistles ; ” but , from your silence , I have everything to fear , so I have only sent you two melancholy things , which I tremble lest they should too well suit the tone of your present feelings .</p>
   <p>In a fortnight I move , bag and baggage , to Nithsdale ; till then , my direction is at this place ; after that period , it will be at Ellisland , near Dumfries . It would extremely oblige me , were it but half a line , to let me know how you are , and where you are . Can I be indifferent to the fate of a man to whom I owe so much ? A man whom I not only esteem , but venerate .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR HONOURED FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>Yours , dated Edinburgh , which I have just read , makes me very unhappy . “ Almost blind and wholly deaf , ” are melancholy news of human nature ; but when told of a much-loved and honoured friend , they carry misery in the sound . Goodness on your part , and gratitude on mine , began a tie which has gradually entwisted itself among the dearest chords of my bosom , and I tremble at the omens of your late and present ailing habit and shattered health . You miscalculate matters widely , when you forbid my waiting on you , lest it should hurt my worldly concerns . My small scale of farming is exceedingly more simple and easy than what you have lately seen at Moreham Mains . But , be that as it may , the heart of the man and the fancy of the poet are the two grand considerations for which I live : if miry ridges and dirty dunghills are to engross the best part of the functions of my soul immortal , I had better been a rook or a magpie at once , and then I should not have been plagued with any ideas superior to breaking of clods and picking up grubs ; not to mention barn-door cocks or mallards , creatures with which I could almost exchange lives at any time . If you continue so deaf , I am afraid a visit will be no great pleasure to either of us ; but if I hear you are got so well again as to be able to relish conversation , look you to it , Madam , for I will make my threatenings good . I am to be at the New-year-day fair of Ayr ; and , by all that is sacred in the world , friend , I will come and see you .</p>
   <p>Your meeting , which you so well describe , with your old schoolfellow and friend , was truly interesting . Out upon the ways of the world !— They spoil “ these social offsprings of the heart . ” Two veterans of the “ men of the world ” would have met with little more heart-workings than two old hacks worn out on the road . Apropos , is not the Scotch phrase , “ Auld lang syne , ” exceedingly expressive ? There is an old song and tune which has often thrilled through my soul . You know I am an enthusiast in old Scotch songs . I shall give you the verses on the other sheet , as I suppose Mr. Ker will save you the postage .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>I understand my very worthy neighbour , Mr. Riddel , has informed you that I have made you the subject of some verses . There is something so provoking in the idea of being the burthen of a ballad , that I do not think Job or Moses , though such patterns of patience and meekness , could have resisted the curiosity to know what that ballad was : so my worthy friend has done me a mischief , which I dare say he never intended ; and reduced me to the unfortunate alternative of leaving your curiosity ungratified , or else disgusting you with foolish verses , the unfinished production of a random moment , and never meant to have met your ear . I have heard or read somewhere of a gentleman who had some genius , much eccentricity , and very considerable dexterity with his pencil . In the accidental group of life into which one is thrown , wherever this gentleman met with a character in a more than ordinary degree congenial to his heart , he used to steal a sketch of the face , merely , he said , as a nota bene , to point out the agreeable recollection to his memory . What this gentleman 's pencil was to him , my muse is to me ; and the verses I do myself the honour to send you are a memento exactly of the same kind that he indulged in .</p>
   <p>It may be more owing to the fastidiousness of my caprice than the delicacy of my taste ; but I am so often tired , disgusted and hurt with insipidity , affectation , and pride of mankind , that when I meet with a person “ after my own heart , ” I positively feel what an orthodox Protestant would call a species of idolatry , which acts on my fancy like inspiration ; and I can no more desist rhyming on the impulse , than an Æolian harp can refuse its tones to the streaming air . A distich or two would be the consequence , though the object which hit my fancy were gray-bearded-age ; but where my theme is youth and beauty , a young lady whose personal charms , wit , and sentiment are equally striking and unaffected — by heavens ! though I had lived three score years a married man , and three score years before I was a married man , my imagination would hallow the very idea : and I am truly sorry that the inclosed stanzas have done such poor justice to such a subject .</p>

   <p>I yesterday tried my cask of whiskey for the first time , and I assure you it does you great credit . It will bear five waters strong ; or six ordinary toddy . The whiskey of this country is a most rascally liquor ; and , by consequence , only drank by the most rascally part of the inhabitants . I am persuaded , if you once get a footing here , you might do a great deal of business , in the way of consumpt ; and should you commence distiller again , this is the native barley country . I am ignorant if , in your present way of dealing , you would think it worth your while to extend your business so far as this country side . I write you this on the account of an accident , which I must take the merit of having partly designed to . A neighbour of mine , a John Currie , miller in Carsemill — a man who is , in a word , a “ very ” good man , even for a £ 500 bargain — he and his wife were in my house the time I broke open the cask . They keep a country public-house and sell a great deal of foreign spirits , but all along thought that whiskey would have degraded this house . They were perfectly astonished at my whiskey , both for its taste and strength ; and , by their desire , I write you to know if you could supply them with liquor of an equal quality , and what price . Please write me by first post , and direct to me at Ellisland , near Dumfries . If you could take a jaunt this way yourself , I have a spare spoon , knife and fork very much at your service . My compliments to Mrs. Tennant , and all the good folks in Glenconnel and Barquharrie .</p>

    <note>The feeling mood of moral reflection exhibited in the following letter , was common to the house of William Burns : in a letter addressed by Gilbert to Robert of this date , the poet is reminded of the early vicissitudes of their name , and desired to look up , and be thankful .</note>

   </lg>
   <p>This , dear Madam , is a morning of wishes , and would to God that I came under the apostle James 's description !— the prayer of a righteous man availeth much . In that case , Madam , you should welcome in a year full of blessings : everything that obstructs or disturbs tranquillity and self-enjoyment , should be removed , and every pleasure that frail humanity can taste , should be yours . I own myself so little a Presbyterian , that I approve of set times and seasons of more than ordinary acts of devotion , for breaking in on that habitual routine of life and thought , which is so apt to reduce our existence to a kind of instinct , or even sometimes , and with some minds , to a state very little superior to mere machinery .</p>
   <p>This day , the first Sunday of May , a breezy , blue-skyed noon some time about the beginning , and a hoary morning and calm sunny day about the end , of autumn ; these , time out of mind , have been with me a kind of holiday .</p>
   <p>I believe I owe this to that glorious paper in the Spectator , “ The Vision of Mirza , ” a piece that struck my young fancy before I was capable of fixing an idea to a word of three syllables : “ On the 6th day of the moon , which , according to the custom of my forefathers , I always keep holy , after washing myself , and offering up my morning devotions , I ascended the high hill of Bagdat , in order to pass the rest of the day in meditation and prayer . ”</p>
   <p>We know nothing , or next to nothing , of the substance or structure of our souls , so cannot account for those seeming caprices in them , that one should be particularly pleased with this thing , or struck with that , which , on minds of a different cast , makes no extraordinary impression . I have some favourite flowers in spring , among which are the mountain-daisy , the hare-bell , the fox-glove , the wild brier-rose , the budding birch , and the hoary hawthorn , that I view and hang over with particular delight . I never hear the loud solitary whistle of the curlew in a summer noon , or the wild mixing cadence of a troop of grey plovers , in an autumnal morning , without feeling an elevation of soul like the enthusiasm of devotion or poetry . Tell me , my dear friend , to what can this be owing ? Are we a piece of machinery , which , like the Æolian harp , passive , takes the impression of the passing accident ? Or do these workings argue something within us above the trodden clod ? I own myself partial to such proofs of those awful and important realities — a God that made all things — man 's immaterial and immortal nature — and a world of weal or woe beyond death and the grave .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>As often as I think of writing to you , which has been three or four times every week these six months , it gives me something so like the idea of an ordinary-sized statue offering at a conversation with the Rhodian colossus , that my mind misgives me , and the affair always miscarries somewhere between purpose and resolve . I have at last got some business with you , and business letters are written by the stylebook . I say my business is with you , Sir , for you never had any with me , except the business that benevolence has in the mansion of poverty .</p>
   <p>The character and employment of a poet were formerly my pleasure , but are now my pride . I know that a very great deal of my late eclat was owing to the singularity of my situation , and the honest prejudice of Scotsmen ; but still , as I said in the preface to my first edition , I do look upon myself as having some pretensions from Nature to the poetic character . I have not a doubt but the knack , the aptitude , to learn the muses ’ trade , is a gift bestowed by him “ who forms the secret bias of the soul ; ” — but I as firmly believe , that excellence in the profession is the fruit of industry , labour , attention , and pains . At least I am resolved to try my doctrine by the test of experience . Another appearance from the press I put off to a very distant day , a day that may never arrive — but poesy I am determined to prosecute with all my vigour . Nature has given very few , if any , of the profession , the talents of shining in every species of composition . I shall try ( for until trial it is impossible to know ) whether she has qualified me to shine in any one . The worst of it is , by the time one has finished a piece , it has been so often viewed and reviewed before the mental eye , that one loses , in a good measure , the powers of critical discrimination . Here the best criterion I know is a friend — not only of abilities to judge , but with good-nature enough , like a prudent teacher with a young learner , to praise perhaps a little more than is exactly just , lest the thin-skinned animal fall into that most deplorable of all poetic diseases — heart-breaking despondency of himself . Dare I , Sir , already immensely indebted to your goodness , ask the additional obligation of your being that friend to me ? I enclose you an essay of mine in a walk of poesy to me entirely new ; I mean the epistle addressed to R. G. Esq . or Robert Graham of Fintray , Esq ., a gentleman of uncommon worth , to whom I lie under very great obligations . The story of the poem , like most of my poems , is connected with my own story , and to give you the one , I must give you something of the other . I cannot boast of Mr. Creech 's ingenuous fair dealing to me . He kept me hanging about Edinburgh from the 7th August , 1787 , until the 13th April , 1788 , before he would condescend to give me a statement of affairs ; nor had I got it even then , but for an angry letter I wrote him , which irritated his pride . “ I could ” not a “ tale ” but a detail “ unfold , ” but what am I that should speak against the Lord 's anointed Bailie of Edinburgh ?</p>
   <p>I believe I shall in the whole , 100l . copyright included , clear about 400l . some little odds ; and even part of this depends upon what the gentleman has yet to settle with me . I give you this information , because you did me the honour to interest yourself much in my welfare . I give you this information , but I give it to yourself only , for I am still much in the gentleman 's mercy . Perhaps I injure the man in the idea I am sometimes tempted to have of him — God forbid I should ! A little time will try , for in a month I shall go to town to wind up the business if possible .</p>
   <p>To give the rest of my story in brief , I have married “ my Jean , ” and taken a farm : with the first step I have every day more and more reason to be satisfied : with the last , it is rather the reverse . I have a younger brother , who supports my aged mother ; another still younger brother , and three sisters , in a farm . On my last return from Edinburgh , it cost me about 180l . to save them from ruin . Not that I have lost so much .— I only interposed between my brother and his impending fate by the loan of so much . I give myself no airs on this , for it was mere selfishness on my part : I was conscious that the wrong scale of the balance was pretty heavily charged , and I thought that throwing a little filial piety and fraternal affection into the scale in my favour , might help to smooth matters at the grand reckoning . There is still one thing would make my circumstances quite easy : I have an excise officer 's commission , and I live in the midst of a country division . My request to Mr. Graham , who is one of the commissioners of excise , was , if in his power , to procure me that division . If I were very sanguine , I might hope that some of my great patrons might procure me a Treasury warrant for supervisor , surveyor-general , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Thus , secure of a livelihood , “ to thee , sweet poetry , delightful maid , ” I would consecrate my future days .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>The enclosed sealed packet I sent to Edinburgh , a few days after I had the happiness of meeting you in Ayrshire , but you were gone for the Continent . I have now added a few more of my productions , those for which I am indebted to the Nithsdale muses . The piece inscribed to R. G . Esq ., is a copy of verses I sent Mr. Graham , of Fintray , accompanying a request for his assistance in a matter to me of very great moment . To that gentleman I am already doubly indebted , for deeds of kindness of serious import to my dearest interests , done in a manner grateful to the delicate feelings of sensibility . This poem is a species of composition new to me , but I do not intend it shall be my last essay of the kind , as you will see by the “ Poet 's Progress . ” These fragments , if my design succeed , are but a small part of the intended whole . I propose it shall be the work of my utmost exertions , ripened by years ; of course I do not wish it much known . The fragment beginning “ A little , upright , pert , tart , &amp; c ., ” I have not shown to man living , till I now send it you . It forms the postulata , the axioms , the definition of a character , which , if it appear at all , shall be placed in a variety of lights . This particular part I send you merely as a sample of my hand at portrait-sketching , but , lest idle conjecture should pretend to point out the original , please to let it be for your single , sole inspection .</p>
   <p>Need I make any apology for this trouble , to a gentleman who has treated me with such marked benevolence and peculiar kindness — who has entered into my interests with so much zeal , and on whose critical decisions I can so fully depend ? A poet as I am by trade , these decisions are to me of the last consequence . My late transient acquaintance among some of the mere rank and file of greatness , I resign with ease ; but to the distinguished champions of genius and learning , I shall be ever ambitious of being known . The native genius and accurate discernment in Mr. Stewart 's critical strictures ; the justness ( iron justice , for he has no bowels of compassion for a poor poetic sinner ) of Dr. Gregory 's remarks , and the delicacy of Professor Dalzel 's taste , I shall ever revere .</p>
   <p>I shall be in Edinburgh some time next month .</p>
   <p>I have the honour to be , Sir ,</p>
   <p>Your highly obliged , and very</p>
   <p>Humble servant ,</p>

    <head>TO BISHOP GEDDES .</head>
    <note>Alexander Geddes was a controversialist and poet , and a bishop of the broken remnant of the Catholic Church of Scotland : he is known as the author of a very humorous ballad called “ The Wee bit Wifickie , ” and as the translator of one of the books of the Iliad , in opposition to Cowper .</note>

   <p>VENERABLE FATHER ,</p>
   <p>As I am conscious that wherever I am , you do me the honour to interest yourself in my welfare , it gives me pleasure to inform you that I am here at last , stationary in the serious business of life , and have now not only the retired leisure , but the hearty inclination , to attend to those great and important questions — what I am ? where I am ? and for what I am destined ?</p>
   <p>In that first concern , the conduct of the man , there was ever but one side on which I was habitually blameable , and there I have secured myself in the way pointed out by Nature and Nature 's God . I was sensible that to so helpless a creature as a poor poet , a wife and family were encumbrances , which a species of prudence would bid him shun ; but when the alternative was , being at eternal warfare with myself , on account of habitual follies , to give them no worse name , which no general example , no licentious wit , no sophistical infidelity , would , to me , ever justify , I must have been a fool to have hesitated , and a madman to have made another choice . Besides , I had in “ my Jean ” a long and much-loved fellow-creature 's happiness or misery among my hands , and who could trifle with such a deposit ?</p>
   <p>In the affair of a livelihood , I think myself tolerably secure : I have good hopes of my farm , but should they fail , I have an excise commission , which on my simple petition , will , at any time , procure me bread . There is a certain stigma affixed to the character of an Excise officer , but I do not pretend to borrow honour from my profession ; and though the salary be comparatively small , it is luxury to anything that the first twenty-five years of my life taught me to expect .</p>
   <p>Thus , with a rational aim and method in life , you may easily guess , my reverend and much-honoured friend , that my characteristical trade is not forgotten . I am , if possible , more than over an enthusiast to the muses . I am determined to study man and nature , and in that view incessantly ; and to try if the ripening and corrections of years can enable me to produce something worth preserving .</p>
   <p>You will see in your book , which I beg your pardon for detaining so long , that I have been tuning my lyre on the banks of Nith . Some large poetic plans that are floating in my imagination , or partly put in execution , I shall impart to you when I have the pleasure of meeting with you ; which , if you are then in Edinburgh , I shall have about the beginning of March .</p>
   <p>That acquaintance , worthy Sir , with which you were pleased to honour me , you must still allow me to challenge ; for with whatever unconcern I give up my transient connexion with the merely great , those self-important beings whose intrinsic * * * * [ con ] cealed under the accidental advantages of their * * * * I cannot lose the patronizing notice of the learned and good , without the bitterest regret .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>Why I did not write to you long ago , is what , even on the rack , I could not answer . If you can in your mind form an idea of indolence , dissipation , hurry , cares , change of country , entering on untried scenes of life , all combined , you will save me the trouble of a blushing apology . It could not be want of regard for a man for whom I had a high esteem before I knew him — an esteem which has much increased since I did know him ; and this caveat entered , I shall plead guilty to any other indictment with which you shall please to charge me .</p>
   <p>After I had parted from you for many months my life was one continued scene of dissipation . Here at last I am become stationary , and have taken a farm and — a wife .</p>
   <p>The farm is beautifully situated on the Nith , a large river that runs by Dumfries , and falls into the Solway frith . I have gotten a lease of my farm as long as I pleased : but how it may turn out is just a guess , it is yet to improve and enclose , &amp; c .; however , I have good hopes of my bargain on the whole .</p>
   <p>My wife is my Jean , with whose story you are partly acquainted . I found I had a much-loved fellow creature 's happiness or misery among my hands , and I durst not trifle with so sacred a deposit . Indeed I have not any reason to repent the step I have taken , as I have attached myself to a very good wife , and have shaken myself loose of every bad failing .</p>
   <p>I have found my book a very profitable business , and with the profits of it I have begun life pretty decently . Should fortune not favour me in farming , as I have no great faith in her fickle ladyship , I have provided myself in another resource , which however some folks may affect to despise it , is still a comfortable shift in the day of misfortune . In the heyday of my fame , a gentleman whose name at least I dare say you know , as his estate lies somewhere near Dundee , Mr. Graham , of Fintray , one of the commissioners of Excise , offered me the commission of an Excise officer . I thought it prudent to accept the offer ; and accordingly I took my instructions , and have my commission by me . Whether I may ever do duty , or be a penny the better for it , is what I do not know ; but I have the comfortable assurance , that come whatever ill fate will , I can , on my simple petition to the Excise-board , get into employ .</p>
   <p>We have lost poor uncle Robert this winter . He has long been very weak , and with very little alteration on him , he expired 3d Jan .</p>
   <p>His son William has been with me this winter , and goes in May to be an apprentice to a mason . His other son , the eldest , John , comes to me I expect in summer . They are both remarkably stout young fellows , and promise to do well . His only daughter , Fanny , has been with me ever since her father 's death , and I purpose keeping her in my family till she be quite woman grown , and fit for service . She is one of the cleverest girls , and has one of the most amiable dispositions I have ever seen .</p>
   <p>All friends in this country and Ayrshire are well . Remember me to all friends in the north . My wife joins me in compliments to Mrs. B. and family .</p>
   <p>I am ever , my dear Cousin ,</p>
   <p>Yours , sincerely ,</p>

   <p>Here am I , my honoured friend , returned safe from the capital . To a man , who has a home , however humble or remote — if that home is like mine , the scene of domestic comfort — the bustle of Edinburgh will soon be a business of sickening disgust .</p>
   <p>“ Vain pomp and glory of this world , I hate you ! ”</p>
   <p>When I must skulk into a corner , lest the rattling equipage of some gaping blockhead should mangle me in the mire , I am tempted to exclaim — “ What merits has he had , or what demerit have I had , in some state of pre-existence , that he is ushered into this state of being with the sceptre of rule , and the key of riches in his puny fist , and I am kicked into the world , the sport of folly , or the victim of pride ? ” I have read somewhere of a monarch ( in Spain I think it was ) , who was so out of humour with the Ptolemean system of astronomy , that he said had he been of the CREATOR 'S council , he could have saved him a great deal of labour and absurdity . I will not defend this blasphemous speech ; but often , as I have glided with humble stealth through the pomp of Princes ’ street , it has suggested itself to me , as an improvement on the present human figure , that a man in proportion to his own conceit of his consequence in the world , could have pushed out the longitude of his common size , as a snail pushes out his horns , or , as we draw out a perspective . This trifling alteration , not to mention the prodigious saving it would be in the tear and wear of the neck and limb-sinews of many of his majesty 's liege subjects , in the way of tossing the head and tiptoe strutting , would evidently turn out a vast advantage , in enabling us at once to adjust the ceremonials in making a bow , or making way to a great man , and that too within a second of the precise spherical angle of reverence , or an inch of the particular point of respectful distance , which the important creature itself requires ; as a measuring-glance at its towering altitude , would determine the affair like instinct .</p>
   <p>You are right , Madam , in your idea of poor Mylne 's poem , which he has addressed to me . The piece has a good deal of merit , but it has one great fault — it is , by far , too long . Besides , my success has encouraged such a shoal of ill-spawned monsters to crawl into public notice , under the title of Scottish Poets , that the very term Scottish Poetry borders on the burlesque . When I write to Mr. Carfrae , I shall advise him rather to try one of his deceased friend 's English pieces . I am prodigiously hurried with my own matters , else I would have requested a perusal of all Mylne 's poetic performances ; and would have offered his friends my assistance in either selecting or correcting what would be proper for the press . What it is that occupies me so much , and perhaps a little oppresses my present spirits , shall fill up a paragraph in some future letter . In the mean time , allow me to close this epistle with a few lines done by a friend of mine * * * * *. I give you them , that as you have seen the original , you may guess whether one or two alterations I have ventured to make in them , be any real improvement .</p>

   <p>REV . SIR ,</p>
   <p>I do not recollect that I have ever felt a severer pang of shame , than on looking at the date of your obliging letter which accompanied Mr. Mylne 's poem .</p>
   <p>I am much to blame : the honour Mr. Mylne has done me , greatly enhanced in its value by the endearing , though melancholy circumstance , of its being the last production of his muse , deserved a better return .</p>
   <p>I have , as you hint , thought of sending a copy of the poem to some periodical publication ; but , on second thoughts , I am afraid , that in the present case , it would be an improper step . My success , perhaps as much accidental as merited , has brought an inundation of nonsense under the name of Scottish poetry . Subscription-bills for Scottish poems have so dunned , and daily do dun the public , that the very name is in danger of contempt . For these reasons , if publishing any of Mr. Mylne 's poems in a magazine , &amp; c ., be at all prudent , in my opinion it certainly should not be a Scottish poem . The profits of the labours of a man of genius are , I hope , as honourable as any profits whatever ; and Mr. Mylne 's relations are most justly entitled to that honest harvest , which fate has denied himself to reap . But let the friends of Mr. Mylne 's fame ( among whom I crave the honour of ranking myself ) always keep in eye his respectability as a man and as a poet , and take no measure that , before the world knows anything about him , would risk his name and character being classed with the fools of the times .</p>
   <p>I have , Sir , some experience of publishing ; and the way in which I would proceed with Mr. Mylne 's poem is this :— I would publish , in two or three English and Scottish public papers , any one of his English poems which should , by private judges , be thought the most excellent , and mention it , at the same time , as one of the productions of a Lothian farmer , of respectable character , lately deceased , whose poems his friends had it in idea to publish , soon , by subscription , for the sake of his numerous family :— not in pity to that family , but in justice to what his friends think the poetic merits of the deceased ; and to secure , in the most effectual manner , to those tender connexions , whose right it is , the pecuniary reward of those merits .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>The gentleman who will deliver you this is a Mr. Nielson , a worthy clergyman in my neighbourhood , and a very particular acquaintance of mine . As I have troubled him with this packet , I must turn him over to your goodness , to recompense him for it in a way in which he much needs your assistance , and where you can effectually serve him :— Mr. Nielson is on his way for France , to wait on his Grace of Queensberry , on some little business of a good deal of importance to him , and he wishes for your instructions respecting the most eligible mode of travelling , &amp; c ., for him , when he has crossed the channel . I should not have dared to take this liberty with you , but that I am told , by those who have the honour of your personal acquaintance , that to be a poor honest Scotchman is a letter of recommendation to you , and that to have it in your power to serve such a character , gives you much pleasure .</p>
   <p>The enclosed ode is a compliment to the memory of the late Mrs. Oswald , of Auchencruive . You , probably , knew her personally , an honour of which I cannot boast ; but I spent my early years in her neighbourhood , and among her servants and tenants . I know that she was detested with the most heart-felt cordiality . However , in the particular part of her conduct which roused my poetic wrath , she was much less blameable . In January last , on my road to Ayrshire , I had put up at Bailie Wigham 's in Sanquhar , the only tolerable inn in the place . The frost was keen , and the grim evening and howling wind were ushering in a night of snow and drift . My horse and I were both much fatigued with the labours of the day , and just as my friend the Bailie and I were bidding defiance to the storm , over a smoking bowl , in wheels the funeral pageantry of the late great Mrs. Oswald , and poor I am forced to brave all the horrors of the tempestuous night , and jade my horse , my young favourite horse , whom I had just christened Pegasus , twelve miles farther on , through the wildest moors and hills of Ayrshire , to New Cumnock , the next inn . The powers of poesy and prose sink under me , when I would describe what I felt . Suffice it to say , that when a good fire at New Cumnock had so far recovered my frozen sinews , I sat down and wrote the enclosed ode .</p>
   <p>I was at Edinburgh lately , and settled finally with Mr. Creech ; and I must own , that , at last , he has been amicable and fair with me .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>I will make no excuse , my dear Bibliopolus ( God forgive me for murdering language ! ) that I have sat down to write you on this vile paper .</p>
   <p>It is economy , Sir ; it is that cardinal virtue , prudence : so I beg you will sit down , and either compose or borrow a panegyric . If you are going to borrow , apply to * * * * to compose , or rather to compound , something very clever on my remarkable frugality ; that I write to one of my most esteemed friends on this wretched paper , which was originally intended for the venal fist of some drunken exciseman , to take dirty notes in a miserable vault of an ale-cellar .</p>
   <p>O Frugality ! thou mother of ten thousand blessings — thou cook of fat beef and dainty greens !— thou manufacturer of warm Shetland hose , and comfortable surtouts !— thou old housewife darning thy decayed stockings with thy ancient spectacles on thy aged nose !— lead me , hand me in thy clutching palsied fist , up those heights , and through those thickets , hitherto inaccessible , and impervious to my anxious , weary feet :— not those Parnassian crags , bleak and barren , where the hungry worshippers of fame are breathless , clambering , hanging between heaven and hell ; but those glittering cliffs of Potosi , where the all-sufficient , all powerful deity , Wealth , holds his immediate court of joys and pleasures ; where the sunny exposure of plenty , and the hot walls of profusion , produce those blissful fruits of luxury , exotics in this world , and natives of paradise !— Thou withered sibyl , my sage conductress , usher me into thy refulgent , adored presence !— The power , splendid and potent as he now is , was once the puling nursling of thy faithful care , and tender arms ! Call me thy son , thy cousin , thy kinsman , or favourite , and adjure the god by the scenes of his infant years , no longer to repulse me as a stranger , or an alien , but to favour me with his peculiar countenance and protection ?— He daily bestows his greatest kindness on the undeserving and the worthless — assure him , that I bring ample documents of meritorious demerits ! Pledge yourself for me , that , for the glorious cause of Lucre , I will do anything , be anything — but the horse-leech of private oppression , or the vulture of public robbery !</p>
   <p>But to descend from heroics .</p>
   <p>I want a Shakspeare ; I want likewise an English dictionary — Johnson 's , I suppose , is best . In these and all my prose commissions , the cheapest is always best for me . There is a small debt of honour that I owe Mr. Robert Cleghorn , in Saughton Mills , my worthy friend , and your well-wisher . Please give him , and urge him to take it , the first time you see him , ten shillings worth of anything you have to sell , and place it to my account .</p>

There is another in emulation of it going on at Closeburn , under the auspices of Mr. Monteith , of Closeburn , which will be on a greater scale than ours . Capt . Riddel gave his infant society a great many of his old books , else I had written you on that subject ; but one of these days , I shall trouble you with a commission for “ The Monkland Friendly Society ” — a copy of The Spectator , Mirror , and Lounger , Man of Feeling , Man of the World , Guthrie 's Geographical Grammar , with some religious pieces , will likely be our first order .</p>

    <head>I have finished the piece which had the happy fortune to be honoured with your approbation ; and never did little miss with more sparkling pleasure show her applauded sampler to partial mamma , than I now send my poem to you and Mr. M'Murdo if he is returned to Drumlanrig . You cannot easily imagine what thin-skinned animals — what sensitive plants poor poets are . How do we shrink into the embittered corner of self-abasement , when neglected or condemned by those to whom we look up ! and how do we , in erect importance , add another cubit to our stature on being noticed and applauded by those whom we honour and respect ! My late visit to Drumlanrig has , I can tell you , Madam , given me a balloon waft up Parnassus , where on my fancied elevation I regard my poetic self with no small degree of complacency . Surely with all their sins , the rhyming tribe are not ungrateful creatures .— I recollect your goodness to your humble guest — I see Mr. M'Murdo adding to the politeness of the gentleman , the kindness of a friend , and my heart swells as it would burst , with warm emotions and ardent wishes ! It may be it is not gratitude — it may be a mixed sensation . That strange , shifting , doubling animal man is so generally , at best , but a negative , often a worthless creature , that we cannot see real goodness and native worth without feeling the bosom glow with sympathetic approbation .</head>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>Your duty-free favour of the 26th April I received two days ago ; I will not say I perused it with pleasure ; that is the cold compliment of ceremony ; I perused it , Sir , with delicious satisfaction ;— in short , it is such a letter , that not you , nor your friend , but the legislature , by express proviso in their postage laws , should frank .</p>
   <p>A letter informed with the soul of friendship is such an honour to human nature , that they should order it free ingress and egress to and from their bags and mails , as an encouragement and mark of distinction to supereminent virtue .</p>
   <p>I have just put the last hand to a little poem which I think will be something to your taste . One morning lately , as I was out pretty early in the fields , sowing some grass seeds , I heard the burst of a shot from a neighbouring plantation , and presently a poor little wounded hare came crippling by me . You will guess my indignation at the inhuman fellow who could shoot a hare at this season , when all of them have young ones . Indeed there is something in that business of destroying for our sport individuals in the animal creation that do not injure us materially , which I could never reconcile to my ideas of virtue .</p>

   <p>I had intended to have troubled you with a long letter , but at present the delightful sensations of an omnipotent toothache so engross all my inner man , as to put it out of my power even to write nonsense . However , as in duty bound , I approach my bookseller with an offering in my hand — a few poetic clinches , and a song :— To expect any other kind of offering from the Rhyming Tribe would be to know them much less than you do . I do not pretend that there is much merit in these morceaux , but I have two reasons for sending them ; primo , they are mostly ill-natured , so are in unison with my present feelings , while fifty troops of infernal spirits are driving post from ear to ear along my jaw-bones ; and secondly , they are so short , that you cannot leave off in the middle , and so hurt my pride in the idea that you found any work of mine too heavy to get through .</p>
   <p>I have a request to beg of you , and I not only beg of you , but conjure you , by all your wishes and by all your hopes , that the muse will spare the satiric wink in the moment of your foibles ; that she will warble the song of rapture round your hymeneal couch ; and that she will shed on your turf the honest tear of elegiac gratitude ! Grant my request as speedily as possible — send me by the very first fly or coach for this place three copies of the last edition of my poems , which place to my account .</p>
   <p>Now may the good things of prose , and the good things of verse , come among thy hands , until they be filled with the good things of this life , prayeth</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>Though I am not without my fears respecting my fate , at that grand , universal inquest of right and wrong , commonly called The Last Day , yet I trust there is one sin , which that arch-vagabond , Satan , who I understand is to be king 's evidence , cannot throw in my teeth , I mean ingratitude . There is a certain pretty large quantum of kindness for which I remain , and from inability , I fear , must still remain , your debtor ; but though unable to repay the debt , I assure you , Sir , I shall ever warmly remember the obligation . It gives me the sincerest pleasure to hear by my old acquaintance , Mr. Kennedy , that you are , in immortal Allan 's language , “ Hale , and weel , and living ; ” and that your charming family are well , and promising to be an amiable and respectable addition to the company of performers , whom the Great Manager of the Drama of Man is bringing into action for the succeeding age .</p>
   <p>With respect to my welfare , a subject in which you once warmly and effectively interested yourself , I am here in my old way , holding my plough , marking the growth of my corn , or the health of my dairy ; and at times sauntering by the delightful windings of the Nith , on the margin of which I have built my humble domicile , praying for seasonable weather , or holding an intrigue with the muses ; the only gipsies with whom I have now any intercourse . As I am entered into the holy state of matrimony , I trust my face is turned completely Zion-ward ; and as it is a rule with all honest fellows to repeat no grievances , I hope that the little poetic licenses of former days will of course fall under the oblivious influence of some good-natured statute of celestial prescription . In my family devotion , which , like a good Presbyterian , I occasionally give to my household folks , I am extremely fond of that psalm , “ Let not the errors of my youth , ” &amp; c ., and that other , “ Lo , children are God 's heritage , ” &amp; c ., in which last Mrs. Burns , who by the bye has a glorious “ wood-note wild ” at either old song or psalmody , joins me with the pathos of Handel 's Messiah .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>I am perfectly ashamed of myself when I look at the date of your last . It is not that I forget the friend of my heart and the companion of my peregrinations ; but I have been condemned to drudgery beyond sufferance , though not , thank God , beyond redemption . I have had a collection of poems by a lady , put into my hands to prepare them for the press ; which horrid task , with sowing corn with my own hand , a parcel of masons , wrights , plasterers , &amp; c ., to attend to , roaming on business through Ayrshire — all this was against me , and the very first dreadful article was of itself too much for me .</p>
   <p>13th . I have not had a moment to spare from incessant toil since the 8th . Life , my dear Sir , is a serious matter . You know by experience that a man 's individual self is a good deal , but believe me , a wife and family of children , whenever you have the honour to be a husband and a father , will show you that your present and most anxious hours of solitude are spent on trifles . The welfare of those who are very dear to us , whose only support , hope and stay we are — this , to a generous mind , is another sort of more important object of care than any concerns whatever which centre merely in the individual . On the other hand , let no young , unmarried , rakehelly dog among you , make a song of his pretended liberty and freedom from care . If the relations we stand in to king , country , kindred , and friends , be anything but the visionary fancies of dreaming metaphysicians ; if religion , virtue , magnanimity , generosity , humanity and justice , be aught but empty sounds ; then the man who may be said to live only for others , for the beloved , honourable female , whose tender faithful embrace endears life , and for the helpless little innocents who are to be the men and women , the worshippers of his God , the subjects of his king , and the support , nay the vital existence of his COUNTRY in the ensuing age ;— compare such a man with any fellow whatever , who , whether he bustle and push in business among labourers , clerks , statesmen ; or whether he roar and rant , and drink and sing in taverns — a fellow over whose grave no one will breathe a single heigh-ho , except from the cobweb-tie of what is called good-fellowship — who has no view nor aim but what terminates in himself — if there be any grovelling earth-born wretch of our species , a renegado to common sense , who would fain believe that the noble creature man , is no better than a sort of fungus , generated out of nothing , nobody knows how , and soon dissipated in nothing , nobody knows where ; such a stupid beast , such a crawling reptile , might balance the foregoing unexaggerated comparison , but no one else would have the patience .</p>
   <p>Forgive me , my dear Sir , for this long silence . To make you amends , I shall send you soon , and more encouraging still , without any postage , one or two rhymes of my later manufacture .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>A poet and a beggar are , in so many points of view , alike , that one might take them for the same individual character under different designations ; were it not that though , with a trifling poetic license , most poets may be styled beggars , yet the converse of the proposition does not hold , that every beggar is a poet . In one particular , however , they remarkably agree ; if you help either the one or the other to a mug of ale , or the picking of a bone , they will very willingly repay you with a song . This occurs to me at present , as I have just despatched a well-lined rib of John Kirkpatrick 's Highlander ; a bargain for which I am indebted to you , in the style of our ballad printers , “ Five excellent new songs . ” The enclosed is nearly my newest song , and one that has cost me some pains , though that is but an equivocal mark of its excellence . Two or three others , which I have by me , shall do themselves the honour to wait on your after leisure : petitioners for admittance into favour must not harass the condescension of their benefactor .</p>
   <p>You see , Sir , what it is to patronize a poet . ‘ Tis like being a magistrate in a petty borough ; you do them the favour to preside in their council for one year , and your name bears the prefatory stigma of Bailie for life .</p>
   <p>With , not the compliments , but the best wishes , the sincerest prayers of the season for you , that you may see many and happy years with Mrs. M'Murdo , and your family ; two blessings by the bye , to which your rank does not , by any means , entitle you ; a loving wife and fine family being almost the only good things of this life to which the farm-house and cottage have an exclusive right ,</p>
   <p>I have the honour to be ,</p>

    <head>DEAR MADAM ,</head>
    <head>Will you take the effusions , the miserable effusions of low spirits , just as they flow from their bitter spring ?

   </lg>
   <p>I have just heard Mr. Kirkpatrick preach a sermon . He is a man famous for his benevolence , and I revere him ; but from such ideas of my Creator , good Lord deliver me ! Religion , my honoured friend , is surely a simple business , as it equally concerns the ignorant and the learned , the poor and the rich . That there is an incomprehensible Great Being , to whom I owe my existence , and that he must be intimately acquainted with the operations and progress of the internal machinery , and consequent outward deportment of this creature which he has made ; these are , I think , self-evident propositions . That there is a real and eternal distinction between virtue and vice , and consequently , that I am an accountable creature ; that from the seeming nature of the human mind , as well as from the evident imperfection , nay , positive injustice , in the administration of affairs , both in the natural and moral worlds , there must be a retributive scene of existence beyond the grave ; must , I think , be allowed by every one who will give himself a moment 's reflection . I will go farther , and affirm that from the sublimity , excellence , and purity of his doctrine and precepts , unparalleled by all the aggregated wisdom and learning of many preceding ages , though , to appearance , he himself was the obscurest and most illiterate of our species ; therefore Jesus Christ was from God .</p>
   <p>Whatever mitigates the woes , or increases the happiness of others , this is my criterion of goodness ; and whatever injures society at large , or any individual in it , this is my measure of iniquity .</p>
   <p>What think you , madam , of my creed ? I trust that I have said nothing that will lessen me in the eye of one , whose good opinion I value almost next to the approbation of my own mind .</p>

    <note>The name of the person to whom the following letter is addressed is unknown : he seems , from his letter to Burns to have been intimate with the unfortunate poet , Robert Fergusson , who , in richness of conversation and plenitude of fancy , reminded him , he said , of Robert Burns .</note>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>The hurry of a farmer in this particular season , and the indolence of a poet at all times and seasons , will , I hope , plead my excuse for neglecting so long to answer your obliging letter of the 5th of August .</p>
   <p>That you have done well in quitting your laborious concern in * * * *, I do not doubt ; the weighty reasons you mention , were , I hope , very , and deservedly indeed , weighty ones , and your health is a matter of the last importance ; but whether the remaining proprietors of the paper have also done well , is what I much doubt . The * * * *, so far as I was a reader , exhibited such a brilliancy of point , such an elegance of paragraph , and such a variety of intelligence , that I can hardly conceive it possible to continue a daily paper in the same degree of excellence : but if there was a man who had abilities equal to the task , that man 's assistance the proprietors have lost .</p>
   <p>When I received your letter I was transcribing for * * * *, my letter to the magistrates of the Canongate , Edinburgh , begging their permission to place a tombstone over poor Fergusson , and their edict in consequence of my petition , but now I shall send them to * * * * * *. Poor Fergusson ! If there be a life beyond the grave , which I trust there is ; and if there be a good God presiding over all nature , which I am sure there is ; thou art now enjoying existence in a glorious world , where worth of the heart alone is distinction in the man ; where riches , deprived of all their pleasure-purchasing powers , return to their native sordid matter ; where titles and honours are the disregarded reveries of an idle dream ; and where that heavy virtue , which is the negative consequence of steady dulness , and those thoughtless , though often destructive follies which are unavoidable aberrations of frail human nature , will be thrown into equal oblivion as if they had never been !</p>
   <p>Adieu my dear sir ! So soon as your present views and schemes are concentered in an aim , I shall be glad to hear from you ; as your welfare and happiness is by no means a subject indifferent to</p>
   <p>Yours ,</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Of the many problems in the nature of that wonderful creature , man , this is one of the most extraordinary , that he shall go on from day to day , from week to week , from month to month , or perhaps from year to year , suffering a hundred times more in an hour from the impotent consciousness of neglecting what he ought to do , than the very doing of it would cost him . I am deeply indebted to you , first for a most elegant poetic compliment ; then for a polite , obliging letter ; and , lastly , for your excellent poem on the Slave Trade ; and yet , wretch that I am ! though the debts were debts of honour , and the creditor a lady , I have put off and put off even the very acknowledgment of the obligation , until you must indeed be the very angel I take you for , if you can forgive me .</p>
   <p>Your poem I have read with the highest pleasure . I have a way whenever I read a book , I mean a book in our own trade , Madam , a poetic one , and when it is my own property , that I take a pencil and mark at the ends of verses , or note on margins and odd paper , little criticisms of approbation or disapprobation as I peruse along . I will make no apology for presenting you with a few unconnected thoughts that occurred to me in my repeated perusals of your poem . I want to show you that I have honesty enough to tell you what I take to be truths , even when they are not quite on the side of approbation ; and I do it in the firm faith that you have equal greatness of mind to hear them with pleasure .</p>
   <p>I had lately the honour of a letter from Dr. Moore , where he tells me that he has sent me some books : they are not yet come to hand , but I hear they are on the way .</p>
   <p>Wishing you all success in your progress in the path of fame ; and that you may equally escape the danger of stumbling through incautious speed , or losing ground through loitering neglect .</p>

    <head>DEAR SIR ,</head>
    <head>I intended to have written you long ere now , and as I told you , I had gotten three stanzas and a half on my way in a poetic epistle to you ; but that old enemy of all good works , the devil , threw me into a prosaic mire , and for the soul of me I cannot get out of it . I dare not write you a long letter , as I am going to intrude on your time with a long ballad . I have , as you will shortly see , finished “ The Kirk 's Alarm ; ” but now that it is done , and that I have laughed once or twice at the conceits in some of the stanzas , I am determined not to let it get into the public ; so I send you this copy , the first that I have sent to Ayrshire , except some few of the stanzas , which I wrote off in embryo for Gavin Hamilton , under the express provision and request that you will only read it to a few of us , and do not on any account give , or permit to be taken , any copy of the ballad . If I could be of any service to Dr. M'Gill , I would do it , though it should be at a much greater expense than irritating a few bigoted priests , but I am afraid serving him in his present embarras is a task too hard for me . I have enemies enow , God knows , though I do not wantonly add to the number . Still as I think there is some merit in two or three of the thoughts , I send it to you as a small , but sincere testimony how much , and with what respectful esteem ,</head>

    <note>The poetic epistle of worthy Janet Little was of small account : nor was the advice of Dr. Moore , to abandon the Scottish stanza and dialect , and adopt the measure and language of modern English poetry , better inspired than the strains of the milkmaid , for such was Jenny Little .</note>

   <p>DEAR MADAM ,</p>
   <p>I have mentioned in my last my appointment to the Excise , and the birth of little Frank ; who , by the bye , I trust will be no discredit to the honourable name of Wallace , as he has a fine manly countenance , and a figure that might do credit to a little fellow two months older ; and likewise an excellent good temper , though when he pleases he has a pipe , only not quite so loud as the horn that his immortal namesake blew as a signal to take out the pin of Stirling bridge .</p>
   <p>I had some time ago an epistle , part poetic , and part prosaic , from your poetess , Mrs. J . Little , a very ingenious , but modest composition . I should have written her as she requested , but for the hurry of this new business . I have heard of her and her compositions in this country ; and I am happy to add , always to the honour of her character . The fact is , I know not well how to write to her : I should sit down to a sheet of paper that I knew not how to stain . I am no dab at fine-drawn letter-writing ; and , except when prompted by friendship or gratitude , or , which happens extremely rarely , inspired by the muse ( I know not her name ) that presides over epistolary writing , I sit down , when necessitated to write , as I would sit down , to beat hemp .</p>
   <p>Some parts of your letter of the 20th August , struck me with the most melancholy concern for the state of your mind at present .</p>
   <p>Would I could write you a letter of comfort , I would sit down to it with as much pleasure , as I would to write an epic poem of my own composition that should equal the Iliad . Religion , my dear friend , is the true comfort ! A strong persuasion in a future state of existence ; a proposition so obviously probable , that , setting revelation aside , every nation and people , so far as investigation has reached , for at least near four thousand years , have , in some mode or other , firmly believed it . In vain would we reason and pretend to doubt . I have myself done so to a very daring pitch ; but , when I reflected , that I was opposing the most ardent wishes , and the most darling hopes of good men , and flying in the face of all human belief , in all ages , I was shocked at my own conduct .</p>
   <p>I know not whether I have ever sent you the following lines , or if you have ever seen them ; but it is one of my favourite quotations , which I keep constantly by me in my progress through life , in the language of the book of Job ,</p>
   <p>“ Against the day of battle and of war ” —</p>
   <p>spoken of religion :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ‘ Tis this , my friend , that streaks our morning bright ,</l>
     <l n="2">‘ Tis this , that gilds the horror of our night .</l>
     <l n="3">When wealth forsakes us , and when friends are few ,</l>
     <l n="4">When friends are faithless , or when foes pursue ;</l>
     <l n="5">Tis this that wards the blow , or stills the smart ,</l>
     <l n="6">Disarms affliction , or repels his dart ;</l>
     <l n="7">Within the breast bids purest raptures rise ,</l>
     <l n="8">Bids smiling conscience spread her cloudless skies . ”</l>

   <p>I have been busy with Zeluco . The Doctor is so obliging as to request my opinion of it ; and I have been revolving in my mind some kind of criticisms on novel-writing , but it is a depth beyond my research . I shall however digest my thoughts on the subject as well as I can . Zeluco is a most sterling performance .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Big with the idea of this important day at Friars-Carse , I have watched the elements and skies in the full persuasion that they would announce it to the astonished world by some phenomena of terrific portent .— Yesternight until a very late hour did I wait with anxious horror , for the appearance of some comet firing half the sky ; or aerial armies of sanguinary Scandinavians , darting athwart the startled heavens , rapid as the ragged lightning , and horrid as those convulsions of nature that bury nations .</p>
   <p>The elements , however , seem to take the matter very quietly : they did not even usher in this morning with triple suns and a shower of blood , symbolical of the three potent heroes , and the mighty claret-shed of the day .— For me , as Thomson in his Winter says of the storm — I shall “ Hear astonished , and astonished sing ”</p>

The first has a kindred claim on Sir Robert , as being a brother Baronet , and likewise a keen Foxite ; the other is one of the worthiest men in the world , and a man of real genius ; so , allow me to say , he has a fraternal claim on you . I want them franked for to-morrow , as I cannot get them to the post to-night .— I shall send a servant again for them in the evening .

   <p>I wish from my inmost soul it were in my power to give you a more substantial gratification and return for all the goodness to the poet , than transcribing a few of his idle rhymes .— However , “ an old song , ” though to a proverb an instance of insignificance , is generally the only coin a poet has to pay with .</p>
   <p>If my poems which I have transcribed , and mean still to transcribe into your book , were equal to the grateful respect and high esteem I bear for the gentleman to whom I present them , they would be the finest poems in the language .— As they are , they will at least be a testimony with what sincerity I have the honour to be ,</p>

    <note>The ignominy of a poet becoming a gauger seems ever to have been present to the mind of Burns — but those moving things ca 'd wives and weans have a strong influence on the actions of man .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , 1st Nov. 1789 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>I had written you long ere now , could I have guessed where to find you , for I am sure you have more good sense than to waste the precious days of vacation time in the dirt of business and Edinburgh .— Wherever you are , God bless you , and lead you not into temptation , but deliver you from evil !</p>
   <p>I do not know if I have informed you that I am now appointed to an excise division , in the middle of which my house and farm lie . In this I was extremely lucky . Without ever having been an expectant , as they call their journeymen excisemen , I was directly planted down to all intents and purposes an officer of excise ; there to flourish and bring forth fruits — worthy of repentance .</p>
   <p>I know not how the word exciseman , or still more opprobrious , gauger , will sound in your ears . I too have seen the day when my auditory nerves would have felt very delicately on this subject ; but a wife and children are things which have a wonderful power in blunting these kind of sensations . Fifty pounds a year for life , and a provision for widows and orphans , you will allow is no bad settlement for a poet . For the ignominy of the profession , I have the encouragement which I once heard a recruiting sergeant give to a numerous , if not a respectable audience , in the streets of Kilmarnock .— “ Gentlemen , for your further and better encouragement , I can assure you that our regiment is the most blackguard corps under the crown , and consequently with us an honest fellow has the surest chance for preferment . ”</p>
   <p>You need not doubt that I find several very unpleasant and disagreeable circumstances in my business ; but I am tired with and disgusted at the language of complaint against the evils of life . Human existence in the most favourable situations does not abound with pleasures , and has its inconveniences and ills ; capricious foolish man mistakes these inconveniences and ills as if they were the peculiar property of his particular situation ; and hence that eternal fickleness , that love of change , which has ruined , and daily does ruin many a fine fellow , as well as many a blockhead , and is almost , without exception , a constant source of disappointment and misery .</p>
   <p>I long to hear from you how you go on — not so much in business as in life . Are you pretty well satisfied with your own exertions , and tolerably at ease in your internal reflections ? ‘ Tis much to be a great character as a lawyer , but beyond comparison more to be a great character as a man . That you may be both the one and the other is the earnest wish , and that you will be both is the firm persuasion of ,</p>

   <p>I have been so hurried , my ever dear friend , that though I got both your letters , I have not been able to command an hour to answer them as I wished ; and even now , you are to look on this as merely confessing debt , and craving days . Few things could have given me so much pleasure as the news that you were once more safe and sound on terra firma , and happy in that place where happiness is alone to be found , in the fireside circle . May the benevolent Director of all things peculiarly bless you in all those endearing connexions consequent on the tender and venerable names of husband and father ! I have indeed been extremely lucky in getting an additional income of £ 50 a year , while , at the same time , the appointment will not cost me above £ 10 or £ 12 per annum of expenses more than I must have inevitably incurred . The worst circumstance is , that the excise division which I have got is so extensive , no less than ten parishes to ride over ; and it abounds besides with so much business , that I can scarcely steal a spare moment . However , labour endears rest , and both together are absolutely necessary for the proper enjoyment of human existence . I cannot meet you anywhere . No less than an order from the Board of Excise , at Edinburgh , is necessary before I can have so much time as to meet you in Ayrshire . But do you come , and see me . We must have a social day , and perhaps lengthen it out with half the half the night before you go again to sea . You are the earliest friend I now have on earth , my brothers excepted ; and is not that an endearing circumstance ? When you and I first met , we were at the green period of human life . The twig would easily take a bent , but would as easily return to its former state . You and I not only took a mutual bent , but by the melancholy , though strong influence of being both of the family of the unfortunate , we were entwined with one another in our growth towards advanced age ; and blasted be the sacrilegious hand that shall attempt to undo the union ! You and I must have one bumper to my favourite toast , “ May the companions of our youth be the friends of our old age ! ” Come and see me one year ; I shall see you at Port Glasgow the next , and if we can contrive to have a gossiping between our two bedfellows , it will be so much additional pleasure . Mrs. Burns joins me in kind compliments to you and Mrs. Brown . Adieu !</p>

    <note>The poet enclosed in this letter to his patron in the Excise the clever verses on Captain Grose , the Kirk 's Alarm , and the first ballad on Captain Miller 's election .</note>
     <l n="1">9th December , 1789 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have a good while had a wish to trouble you with a letter , and had certainly done it long ere now — but for a humiliating something that throws cold water on the resolution , as if one should say , “ You have found Mr. Graham a very powerful and kind friend indeed , and that interest he is so kindly taking in your concerns , you ought by everything in your power to keep alive and cherish . ” Now though since God has thought proper to make one powerful and another helpless , the connexion of obliger and obliged is all fair ; and though my being under your patronage is to me highly honourable , yet , Sir , allow me to flatter myself , that , as a poet and an honest man you first interested yourself in my welfare , and principally as such , still you permit me to approach you .</p>
   <p>I have found the excise business go on a great deal smoother with me than I expected ; owing a good deal to the generous friendship of Mr. Mitchel , my collector , and the kind assistance of Mr. Findlater , my supervisor . I dare to be honest , and I fear no labour . Nor do I find my hurried life greatly inimical to my correspondence with the muses . Their visits to me , indeed , and I believe to most of their acquaintance , like the visits of good angels , are short and far between : but I meet them now and then as I jog through the hills of Nithsdale , just as I used to do on the banks of Ayr . I take the liberty to enclose you a few bagatelles , all of them the productions of my leisure thoughts in my excise rides .</p>
   <p>If you know or have ever seen Captain Grose , the antiquarian , you will enter into any humour that is in the verses on him . Perhaps you have seen them before , as I sent them to a London newspaper . Though I dare say you have none of the solemn-league-and-covenant fire , which shone so conspicuous in Lord George Gordon , and the Kilmarnock weavers , yet I think you must have heard of Dr. M'Gill , one of the clergymen of Ayr , and his heretical book . God help him , poor man ! Though he is one of the worthiest , as well as one of the ablest of the whole priesthood of the Kirk of Scotland , in every sense of that ambiguous term , yet the poor Doctor and his numerous family are in imminent danger of being thrown out to the mercy of the winter-winds . The enclosed ballad on that business is , I confess , too local , but I laughed myself at some conceits in it , though I am convinced in my conscience that there are a good many heavy stanzas in it too .</p>
   <p>The election ballad , as you will see , alludes to the present canvass in our string of boroughs . I do not believe there will be such a hard-run match in the whole general election .</p>
   <p>I am too little a man to have any political attachments ; I am deeply indebted to , and have the warmest veneration for , individuals of both parties ; but a man who has it in his power to be the father of his country , and who * * * * *, is a character that one cannot speak of with patience .</p>

   <p>Many thanks , dear Madam , for your sheet-full of rhymes . Though at present I am below the veriest prose , yet from you everything pleases . I am groaning under the miseries of a diseased nervous system ; a system , the state of which is most conducive to our happiness — or the most productive of our misery . For now near three weeks I have been so ill with a nervous head-ache , that I have been obliged for a time to give up my excise-books , being scarce able to lift my head , much less to ride once a week over ten muir parishes . What is man ?— To-day in the luxuriance of health , exulting in the enjoyment of existence ; in a few days , perhaps in a few hours , loaded with conscious painful being , counting the tardy pace of the lingering moments by the repercussions of anguish , and refusing or denied a comforter . Day follows night , and night comes after day , only to curse him with life which gives him no pleasure ; and yet the awful , dark termination of that life is something at which he recoils .</p>

   <p>Can it be possible , that when I resign this frail , feverish being , I shall still find myself in conscious existence ? When the last gasp of agony has announced that I am no more to those that knew me , and the few who loved me ; when the cold , stiffened , unconscious , ghastly corse is resigned into the earth , to be the prey of unsightly reptiles , and to become in time a trodden clod , shall I be yet warm in life , seeing and seen , enjoying and enjoyed ? Ye venerable sages and holy flamens , is there probability in your conjectures , truth in your stories , of another world beyond death ; or are they all alike , baseless visions , and fabricated fables ? If there is another life , it must be only for the just , the benevolent , the amiable , and the humane ; what a flattering idea , then , is a world to come ! Would to God I as firmly believed it , as I ardently wish it ! There I should meet an aged parent , now at rest from the many buffetings of an evil world , against which he so long and so bravely struggled . There should I meet the friend , the disinterested friend of my early life ; the man who rejoiced to see me , because he loved me and could serve me .— Muir , thy weaknesses were the aberrations of human nature , but thy heart glowed with everything generous , manly and noble ; and if ever emanation from the All-good Being animated a human form , it was thine ! There should I , with speechless agony of rapture , again recognise my lost , my ever dear Mary ! whose bosom was fraught with truth , honour , constancy , and love .</p>
   <p>“ My Mary , dear departed shade ! Where is thy place of heavenly rest ? Seest thou thy lover lowly laid ? Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast ? ”</p>
   <p>Jesus Christ , thou amiablest of characters ! I trust thou art no impostor , and that thy revelation of blissful scenes of existence beyond death and the grave , is not one of the many impositions which time after time have been palmed on credulous mankind . I trust that in thee “ shall all the families of the earth be blessed , ” by being yet connected together in a better world , where every tie that bound heart to heart , in this state of existence , shall be , far beyond our present conceptions , more endearing .</p>
   <p>I am a good deal inclined to think with those who maintain , that what are called nervous affections are in fact diseases of the mind . I cannot reason , I cannot think ; and but to you I would not venture to write anything above an order to a cobbler . You have felt too much of the ills of life not to sympathise with a diseased wretch , who has impaired more than half of any faculties he possessed . Your goodness will excuse this distracted scrawl , which the writer dare scarcely read , and which he would throw into the fire , were he able to write anything better , or indeed anything at all .</p>
   <p>Rumour told me something of a son of yours , who was returned from the East or West Indies . If you have gotten news from James or Anthony , it was cruel in you not to let me know ; as I promise you on the sincerity of a man , who is weary of one world , and anxious about another , that scarce anything could give me so much pleasure as to hear of any good thing befalling my honoured friend .</p>
   <p>If you have a minute 's leisure , take up your pen in pity to le pauvre miserable .</p>

    <note>The Lady Winifred Maxwell , the last of the old line of Nithsdale , was granddaughter of that Earl who , in 1715 , made an almost miraculous escape from death , through the spirit and fortitude of his countess , a lady of the noble family of Powis .</note>

    <head>MY LADY ,</head>
    <head>In vain have I from day to day expected to hear from Mrs. Young , as she promised me at Dalswinton that she would do me the honour to introduce me at Tinwald ; and it was impossible , not from your ladyship 's accessibility , but from my own feelings , that I could go alone . Lately indeed , Mr. Maxwell of Carruchen , in his usual goodness , offered to accompany me , when an unlucky indisposition on my part hindered my embracing the opportunity . To court the notice or the tables of the great , except where I sometimes have had a little matter to ask of them , or more often the pleasanter task of witnessing my gratitude to them , is what I never have done , and I trust never shall do . But with your ladyship I have the honour to be connected by one of the strongest and most endearing ties in the whole moral world . Common sufferers , in a cause where even to be unfortunate is glorious , the cause of heroic loyalty ! Though my fathers had not illustrious honours and vast properties to hazard in the contest , though they left their humble cottages only to add so many units more to the unnoted crowd that followed their leaders , yet what they could they did , and what they had they lost ; with unshaken firmness and unconcealed political attachments , they shook hands with ruin for what they esteemed the cause of their king and their country . The language and the enclosed verses are for your ladyship 's eye alone . Poets are not very famous for their prudence ; but as I can do nothing for a cause which is now nearly no more , I do not wish to hurt myself .</head>

    <head>DEAR PROVOST ,</head>
    <head>As my friend Mr. Graham goes for your good town to-morrow , I cannot resist the temptation to send you a few lines , and as I have nothing to say I have chosen this sheet of foolscap , and begun as you see at the top of the first page , because I have ever observed , that when once people have fairly set out they know not where to stop . Now that my first sentence is concluded , I have nothing to do but to pray heaven to help me on to another . Shall I write you on Politics or Religion , two master subjects for your sayers of nothing . Of the first I dare say by this time you are nearly surfeited : and for the last , whatever they may talk of it , who make it a kind of company concern , I never could endure it beyond a soliloquy . I might write you on farming , on building , or marketing , but my poor distracted mind is so torn , so jaded , so racked and bediveled with the task of the superlative damned to make one guinea do the business of three , that I detest , abhor , and swoon at the very word business , though no less than four letters of my very short sirname are in it .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Well , to make the matter short , I shall betake myself to a subject</l>

   <p>If at any time you expect a field-day in your town , a day when Dukes , Earls , and Knights pay their court to weavers , tailors , and cobblers , I should like to know of it two or three days beforehand . It is not that I care three skips of a cur dog for the politics , but I should like to see such an exhibition of human nature .

    <head>CLXXX .</head>
    <head>TO SIR JOHN SINCLAIR .</head>
    <note>Of the Monkland Book-Club alluded to in this letter , the clergyman had omitted all mention in his account of the Parish of Dunscore , published in Sir John Sinclair 's work : some of the books which the poet introduced were stigmatized as vain and frivolous .</note>
     <l n="1">1790 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>The following circumstance has , I believe , been committed in the statistical account , transmitted to you of the parish of Dunscore , in Nithsdale . I beg leave to send it to you because it is new , and may be useful . How far it is deserving of a place in your patriotic publication , you are the best judge .</p>
   <p>To store the minds of the lower classes with useful knowledge , is certainly of very great importance , both to them as individuals and to society at large . Giving them a turn for reading and reflection , is giving them a source of innocent and laudable amusement : and besides , raises them to a more dignified degree in the scale of rationality . Impressed with this idea , a gentleman in this parish , Robert Riddel , Esq ., of Glenriddel , set on foot a species of circulating library , on a plan so simple as to be practicable in any corner of the country ; and so useful , as to deserve the notice of every country gentleman , who thinks the improvement of that part of his own species , whom chance has thrown into the humble walks of the peasant and the artisan , a matter worthy of his attention .</p>
   <p>Mr. Riddel got a number of his own tenants , and farming neighbors , to form themselves into a society for the purpose of having a library among themselves . They entered into a legal engagement to abide by it for three years ; with a saving clause or two in case of a removal to a distance , or death . Each member , at his entry , paid five shillings ; and at each of their meetings , which were held every fourth Saturday , sixpence more . With their entry-money , and the credit which they took on the faith of their future funds , they laid in a tolerable stock of books at the commencement . What authors they were to purchase , was always decided by the majority . At every meeting , all the books , under certain fines and forfeitures , by way of penalty , were to be produced ; and the members had their choice of the volumes in rotation . He whose name stood for that night first on the list , had his choice of what volume he pleased in the whole collection ; the second had his choice after the first ; the third after the second , and so on to the last . At next meeting , he who had been first on the list at the preceding meeting , was last at this ; he who had been second was first ; and so on through the whole three years . At the expiration of the engagement the books were sold by auction , but only among the members themselves ; each man had his share of the common stock , in money or in books , as he chose to be a purchaser or not .</p>
   <p>At the breaking up of this little society , which was formed under Mr. Riddel 's patronage , what with benefactions of books from him , and what with their own purchases , they had collected together upwards of one hundred and fifty volumes . It will easily be guessed , that a good deal of trash would be bought . Among the books , however , of this little library , were , Blair 's Sermons , Robertson 's History of Scotland , Hume 's History of the Stewarts , The Spectator , Idler , Adventurer , Mirror , Lounger , Observer , Man of Feeling , Man of the World , Chrysal , Don Quixote , Joseph Andrews , &amp; c. A peasant who can read , and enjoy such books , is certainly a much superior being to his neighbour , who perhaps stalks besides his team , very little removed , except in shape , from the brutes he drives .</p>
   <p>Wishing your patriotic exertions their so much merited success ,</p>
   <p>I am , Sir ,</p>
   <p>Your humble servant ,</p>

    <head>A PEASANT .</head>
    <head>CLXXXI .</head>
    <head>TO CHARLES SHARPE , ESQ .,</head>
    <head>OF HODDAM .</head>
    <note>The family of Hoddam is of old standing in Nithsdale . It has mingled blood with some of the noblest Scottish names ; nor is it unknown either in history or literature — the fierce knight of Closeburn , who in the scuffle between Bruce and Comyne drew his sword and made “ sicker , ” and my friend Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe , are not the least distinguished of its members .</note>
     <l n="1">[ 1790 . ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is true , Sir , you are a gentleman of rank and fortune , and I am a poor devil : you are a feather in the cap of society , and I am a very hobnail in its shoes ; yet I have the honour to belong to the same family with you , and on that score I now address you . You will perhaps suspect that I am going to claim affinity with the ancient and honourable house of Kirkpatrick . No , no , Sir : I cannot indeed be properly said to belong to any house , or even any province or kingdom ; as my mother , who , for many years was spouse to a marching regiment , gave me into this bad world , aboard the packet-boat , somewhere between Donaghadee and Portpatrick . By our common family , I mean , Sir , the family of the muses . I am a fiddler and a poet ; and you , I am told , play an exquisite violin , and have a standard taste in the Belles Lettres . The other day , a brother catgut gave me a charming Scots air of your composition . If I was pleased with the tune , I was in raptures with the title you have given it ; and taking up the idea I have spun it into the three stanzas enclosed . Will you allow me , Sir , to present you them , as the dearest offering that a misbegotten son of poverty and rhyme has to give ? I have a longing to take you by the hand and unburthen my heart by saying , “ Sir , I honour you as a man who supports the dignity of human nature , amid an age when frivolity and avarice have , between them , debased us below the brutes that perish ! ” But , alas , Sir ! to me you are unapproachable . It is true , the muses baptized me in Castalian streams , but the thoughtless gipsies forgot to give me a name . As the sex have served many a good fellow , the Nine have given me a great deal of pleasure , but , bewitching jades ! they have beggared me . Would they but spare me a little of their cast-linen ! Were it only in my power to say that I have a shirt on my back ! but the idle wenches , like Solomon 's lilies , “ they toil not , neither do they spin ; ” so I must e'en continue to tie my remnant of a cravat , like the hangman 's rope , round my naked throat , and coax my galligaskins to keep together their many-coloured fragments . As to the affair of shoes , I have given that up . My pilgrimages in my ballad-trade , from town to town , and on your stony-hearted turnpikes too , are what not even the hide of Job 's Behemoth could bear . The coat on my back is no more : I shall not speak evil of the dead . It would be equally unhandsome and ungrateful to find fault with my old surtout , which so kindly supplies and conceals the want of that coat . My hat indeed is a great favourite ; and though I got it literally for an old song , I would not exchange it for the best beaver in Britain . I was , during several years , a kind of factotum servant to a country clergyman , where I pickt up a good many scraps of learning , particularly in some branches of the mathematics . Whenever I feel inclined to rest myself on my way , I take my seat under a hedge , laying my poetic wallet on the one side , and my fiddle-case on the other , and placing my hat between my legs , I can , by means of its brim , or rather brims , go through the whole doctrine of the conic sections .</p>
   <p>However , Sir , do n't let me mislead you , as if I would interest your pity . Fortune has so much forsaken me , that she has taught me to live without her ; and amid all my rags and poverty , I am as independent , and much more happy , than a monarch of the world . According to the hackneyed metaphor , I value the several actors in the great drama of life , simply as they act their parts . I can look on a worthless fellow of a duke with unqualified contempt , and can regard an honest scavenger with sincere respect . As you , Sir , go through your role with such distinguished merit , permit me to make one in the chorus of universal applause , and assure you that with the highest respect ,</p>
   <p>I have the honour to be , &amp; c .,</p>

   <p>DEAR BROTHER ,</p>
   <p>I mean to take advantage of the frank , though I have not , in my present frame of mind , much appetite for exertion in writing . My nerves are in a cursed state . I feel that horrid hypochondria pervading every atom of both body and soul . This farm has undone my enjoyment of myself . It is a ruinous affair on all hands But let it go to bell ! I 'll fight it out and be off with it .</p>
   <p>We have gotten a set of very decent players here just now . I have seen them an evening or two . David Campbell , in Ayr , wrote to me by the manager of the company , a Mr. Sutherland , who is a man of apparent worth . On New-year-day evening I gave him the following prologue , which he spouted to his audience with applause .</p>

    <head>CLXXXIV .</head>
    <head>TO WILLIAM DUNBAR , W. S .</head>
    <note>This letter was first published by the Ettrick Shepherd , in his edition of Burns : it is remarkable for this sentence , “ I am resolved never to breed up a son of mine to any of the learned professions : I know the value of independence , and since I cannot give my sons an independent fortune , I shall give them an independent line of life . ” We may look round us and inquire which line of life the poet could possibly mean .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , 14th January , 1790 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Since we are here creatures of a day , since “ a few summer days , and a few winter nights , and the life of man is at an end , ” why , my dear much-esteem Sir , should you and I let negligent indolence , for I know it is nothing worse , step in between us and bar the enjoyment of a mutual correspondence ? We are not shapen out of the common , heavy , methodical clod , the elemental stuff of the plodding selfish race , the sons of Arithmetic and Prudence ; our feelings and hearts are not benumbed and poisoned by the cursed influence of riches , which , whatever blessing they may be in other respects , are no friends to the nobler qualities of the heart : in the name of random sensibility , then , let never the moon change on our silence any more . I have had a tract of had health most part of this winter , else you had heard from me long ere now . Thank Heaven , I am now got so much better as to be able to partake a little in the enjoyments of life .</p>
   <p>Our friend Cunningham will , perhaps , have told you of my going into the Excise . The truth is , I found it a very convenient business to have £ 50 per annum , nor have I yet felt any of those mortifying circumstances in it that I was led to fear .</p>
   <p>Feb. 2 .</p>
   <p>I have not , for sheer hurry of business , been able to spare five minutes to finish my letter . Besides my farm business , I ride on my Excise matters at least two hundred miles every week . I have not by any means given up the muses . You will see in the 3d vol . of Johnson 's Scots songs that I have contributed my mite there .</p>
   <p>But , my dear Sir , little ones that look up to you for paternal protection are an important charge . I have already two fine , healthy , stout little fellows , and I wish to throw some light upon them . I have a thousand reveries and schemes about them , and their future destiny . Not that I am a Utopian projector in these things . I am resolved never to breed up a son of mine to any of the learned professions . I know the value of independence ; and since I cannot give my sons an independent fortune , I shall give them an independent line of life . What a chaos of hurry , chance , and changes is this world , when one sits soberly down to reflect on it ! To a father , who himself knows the world , the thought that he shall have sons to usher into it must fill him with dread ; but if he have daughters , the prospect in a thoughtful moment is apt to shock him .</p>
   <p>I hope Mrs. Fordyce and the two young ladies are well . Do let me forget that they are nieces of yours , and let me say that I never saw a more interesting , sweeter pair of sisters in my life . I am the fool of my feelings and attachments . I often take up a volume of my Spenser to realize you to my imagination , and think over the social scenes we have had together . God grant that there may be another world more congenial to honest fellows beyond this . A world where these rubs and plagues of absence , distance , misfortunes , ill-health , &amp; c ., shall no more damp hilarity and divide friendship . This I know is your throng season , but half a page will much oblige ,</p>

    <note>Falconer , the poet , whom Burns mentions here , perished in the Aurora , in which he acted as purser : he was a satirist of no mean power , and wrote that useful work , the Marine Dictionary : but his fame depends upon “ The Shipwreck , ” one of the most original and mournful poems in the language .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , 25th January , 1790 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It has been owing to unremitting hurry of business that I have not written to you , Madam , long ere now . My health is greatly better , and I now begin once more to share in satisfaction and enjoyment with the rest of my fellow-creatures .</p>
   <p>Many thanks , my much-esteemed friend , for your kind letters ; but why will you make me run the risk of being contemptible and mercenary in my own eyes ? When I pique myself on my independent spirit , I hope it is neither poetic license , nor poetic rant ; and I am so flattered with the honour you have done me , in making me your compeer in friendship and friendly correspondence , that I cannot without pain , and a degree of mortification , be reminded of the real inequality between our situations .</p>
   <p>Most sincerely do I rejoice with you , dear Madam , in the good news of Anthony . Not only your anxiety about his fate , but my own esteem for such a noble , warm-hearted , manly young fellow , in the little I had of his acquaintance , has interested me deeply in his fortunes .</p>
   <p>Falconer , the unfortunate author of the “ Shipwreck , ” which you so much admire , is no more . After witnessing the dreadful catastrophe he so feelingly describes in his poem , and after weathering many hard gales of fortune , he went to the bottom with the Aurora frigate !</p>
   <p>I forget what part of Scotland had the honour of giving him birth ; but he was the son of obscurity and misfortune . He was one of those daring adventurous spirits , which Scotland , beyond any other country , is remarkable for producing . Little does the fond mother think , as she hangs delighted over the sweet little leech at her bosom , where the poor fellow may hereafter wander , and what may be his fate . I remember a stanza in an old Scottish ballad , which , notwithstanding its rude simplicity , speaks feelingly to the heart :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Little did my mother think ,</l>
     <l n="2">That day she cradled me ,</l>
     <l n="3">What land I was to travel in ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or what death I should die ! "[ 195 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Old Scottish song are , you know , a favourite study and pursuit of mine , and now I am on that subject , allow me to give you two stanzas of another old simple ballad , which I am sure will please you . The catastrophe of the piece is a poor ruined female , lamenting her fate . She concludes with this pathetic wish :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ O that my father had ne'er on me smil 'd ;</l>
     <l n="2">O that my mother had ne'er to me sung !</l>
     <l n="3">O that my cradle had never been rock 'd ;</l>
     <l n="4">But that I had died when I was young !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">“ O that the grave it were my bed ;</l>
     <l n="6">My blankets were my winding sheet ;</l>
     <l n="7">The clocks and the worms my bedfellows a ’ ;</l>
     <l n="8">And O sae sound as I should sleep ! ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I do not remember in all my reading , to have met with anything more truly the language of misery , than the exclamation in the last line . Misery is like love ; to speak its language truly , the author must have felt it .</p>
   <p>I am every day expecting the doctor to give your little godson<span corresp="#note196" type="note_anchor">[ 196 ]</span>the small-pox . They are rife in the country , and I tremble for his fate . By the way , I cannot help congratulating you on his looks and spirit . Every person who sees him , acknowledges him to be the finest , handsomest child he has ever seen . I am myself delighted with the manly swell of his little chest , and a certain miniature dignity in the carriage of his head , and the glance of his fine black eye , which promise the undaunted gallantry of an independent mind .</p>
   <p>I thought to have sent you some rhymes , but time forbids . I promise you poetry until you are tired of it , next time I have the honour of assuring you how truly I am , &amp; c .</p>

    <note>The Mademoiselle Burns whom the poet inquires about , was one of the “ ladies of the Canongate , ” who desired to introduce free trade in her profession into a close borough : this was refused by the magistrates of Edinburgh , though advocated with much eloquence and humour in a letter by her namesake — it is coloured too strongly with her calling to be published .</note>

   <p>No ! I will not say one word about apologies or excuses for not writing .— I am a poor , rascally gauger , condemned to gallop at least 200 miles every week to inspect dirty ponds and yeasty barrels , and where can I find time to write to , or importance to interest anybody ? The upbraidings of my conscience , nay the upbraidings of my wife , have persecuted me on your account these two or three months past .— I wish to God I was a great man , that my correspondence might throw light upon you , to let the world see what you really are : and then I would make your fortune without putting my hand in my pocket for you , which , like all other great men , I suppose I would avoid as much as possible . What are you doing , and how are you doing ? Have you lately seen any of my few friends ? What is become of the BOROUGH REFORM , or how is the fate of my poor namesake , Mademoiselle Burns , decided ? O man ! but for thee and thy selfish appetites , and dishonest artifices , that beauteous form , and that once innocent and still ingenuous mind , might have shone conspicuous and lovely in the faithful wife , and the affectionate mother ; and shall the unfortunate sacrifice to thy pleasures have no claim on thy humanity !</p>
   <p>I saw lately in a Review , some extracts from a new poem , called the Village Curate ; send it me . I want likewise a cheap copy of The World . Mr. Armstrong , the young poet , who does me the honour to mention me so kindly in his works , please give him my best thanks for the copy of his book — I shall write him , my first leisure hour . I like his poetry much , but I think his style in prose quite astonishing .</p>
   <p>Your book came safe , and I am going to trouble you with further commissions . I call it troubling you ,— because I want only , BOOKS ; the cheapest way , the best ; so you may have to hunt for them in the evening auctions . I want Smollette 's works , for the sake of his incomparable humour . I have already Roderick Random , and Humphrey Clinker .— Peregrine Pickle , Launcelot Greaves , and Ferdinand Count Fathom , I still want ; but as I said , the veriest ordinary copies will serve me . I am nice only in the appearance of my poets . I forget the price of Cowper 's Poems , but , I believe , I must have them . I saw the other day , proposals for a publication , entitled “ Banks 's new and complete Christian 's Family Bible , ” printed for C. Cooke , Paternoster-row , London .— He promises at least , to give in the work , I think it is three hundred and odd engravings , to which he has put the names of the first artists in London .— You will know the character of the performance , as some numbers of it are published ; and if it is really what it pretends to be , set me down as a subscriber , and send me the published numbers .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>That d — mned mare of yours is dead . I would freely have given her price to have saved her ; she has vexed me beyond description . Indebted as I was to your goodness beyond what I can ever repay , I eagerly grasped at your offer to have the mare with me . That I might at least show my readiness in wishing to be grateful , I took every care of her in my power . She was never crossed for riding above half a score of times by me or in my keeping . I drew her in the plough , one of three , for one poor week . I refused fifty-five shillings for her , which was the highest bode I could squeeze for her . I fed her up and had her in fine order for Dumfries fair ; when four or five days before the fair , she was seized with an unaccountable disorder in the sinews , or somewhere in the bones of the neck ; with a weakness or total want of power in her fillets , and in short the whole vertebrae of her spine seemed to be diseased and unhinged , and in eight-and-forty hours , in spite of the two best farriers in the country , she died and be d — mned to her ! The farriers said that she had been quite strained in the fillets beyond cure before you had bought her ; and that the poor devil , though she might keep a little flesh , had been jaded and quite worn out with fatigue and oppression . While she was with me , she was under my own eye , and I assure you , my much valued friend , everything was done for her that could be done ; and the accident has vexed me to the heart . In fact I could not pluck up spirits to write to you , on account of the unfortunate business .</p>
   <p>There is little new in this country . Our theatrical company , of which you must have heard , leave us this week .— Their merit and character are indeed very great , both on the stage and in private life ; not a worthless creature among them ; and their encouragement has been accordingly . Their usual run is from eighteen to twenty-five pounds a night : seldom less than the one , and the house will hold no more than the other . There have been repeated instances of sending away six , and eight , and ten pounds a night for want of room . A new theatre is to be built by subscription ; the first stone is to be laid on Friday first to come . Three hundred guineas have been raised by thirty subscribers , and thirty more might have been got if wanted . The manager , Mr. Sutherland , was introduced to me by a friend from Ayr ; and a worthier or cleverer fellow I have rarely met with . Some of our clergy have slipt in by stealth now and then ; but they have got up a farce of their own . You must have heard how the Rev . Mr. Lawson of Kirkmahoe , seconded by the Rev . Mr. Kirkpatrick of Dunscore , and the rest of that faction , have accused in formal process , the unfortunate and Rev . Mr. Heron , of Kirkgunzeon , that in ordaining Mr. Nielson to the cure of souls in Kirkbean , he , the said Heron , feloniously and treasonably bound the said Nielson to the confession of faith , so far as it was agreeable to reason and the word of God !</p>
   <p>Mrs. B. begs to be remembered most gratefully to you . Little Bobby and Frank are charmingly well and healthy . I am jaded to death with fatigue . For these two or three months , on an average , I have not ridden less than two hundred miles per week . I have done little in the poetic way . I have given Mr. Sutherland two Prologues ; one of which was delivered last week . I have likewise strung four or five barbarous stanzas , to the tune of Chevy Chase , by way of Elegy on your poor unfortunate mare , beginning ( the name she got here was Peg Nicholson )</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Peg Nicholson was a good bay mare ,</l>
     <l n="2">As ever trod on airn ;</l>
     <l n="3">But now she 's floating down the Nith ,</l>
     <l n="4">And past the mouth o ’ Cairn . ”</l>

   <p>But to make amends , since of modish post I have none , except one poor widowed half-sheet of gilt , which lies in my drawer among my plebeian fool'shYpppHeNcap pages , like the widow of a man of fashion , whom that unpolite scoundrel , Necessity , has driven from Burgundy and Pineapple , to a dish of Bohea , with the scandal-bearing help-mate of a village-priest ; or a glass of whisky-toddy , with a ruby-nosed yoke-fellow of a foot-padding exciseman — I make a vow to enclose this sheet-full of epistolary fragments in that my only scrap of gilt paper .</p>
   <p>I am indeed your unworthy debtor for three friendly letters . I ought to have written to you long ere now , but it is a literal fact , I have scarcely a spare moment . It is not that I will not write to you ; Miss Burnet is not more dear to her guardian angel , nor his grace the Duke of Queensbury to the powers of darkness , than my friend Cunningham to me . It is not that I cannot write to you ; should you doubt it , take the following fragment , which was intended for you some time ago , and be convinced that I can antithesize sentiment , and circumvolute periods , as well as any coiner of phrase in the regions of philology .</p>
   <p>December , 1789 .</p>
   <p>MY DEAR CUNNINGHAM ,</p>
   <p>Where are you ? And what are you doing ? Can you be that son of levity , who takes up a friendship as he takes up a fashion ; or are you , like some other of the worthiest fellows in the world , the victim of indolence , laden with fetters of ever-increasing weight ?</p>
   <p>What strange beings we are ! Since we have a portion of conscious existence , equally capable of enjoying pleasure , happiness , and rapture , or of suffering pain , wretchedness , and misery , it is surely worthy of an inquiry , whether there be not such a thing as a science of life ; whether method , economy , and fertility of expedients be not applicable to enjoyment , and whether there be not a want of dexterity in pleasure , which renders our little scantling of happiness still less ; and a profuseness , an intoxication in bliss , which leads to satiety , disgust , and self-abhorrence . There is not a doubt but that health , talents , character , decent competency , respectable friends , are real substantial blessings ; and yet do we not daily see those who enjoy many or all of these good things contrive notwithstanding to be as unhappy as others to whose lot few of them have fallen ? I believe one great source of this mistake or misconduct is owing to a certain stimulus , with us called ambition , which goads us up the hill of life , not as we ascend other eminences , for the laudable curiosity of viewing an extended landscape , but rather for the dishonest pride of looking down on others of our fellow-creatures , seemingly diminutive in humbler stations , &amp; c &amp; c .</p>

   <p>Luckily for me , I was prevented from the discussion of the knotty point at which I had just made a full stop . All my fears and care are of this world : if there is another , an honest man has nothing to fear from it . I hate a man that wishes to be a Deist : but I fear , every fair , unprejudiced inquirer must in some degree be a sceptic . It is not that there are any very staggering arguments against the immortality of man ; but like electricity , phlogiston , &amp; c ., the subject is so involved in darkness , that we want data to go upon . One thing frightens me much : that we are to live for ever , seems too good news to be true . That we are to enter into a new scene of existence , where , exempt from want and pain , we shall enjoy ourselves and our friends without satiety or separation — how much should I be indebted to any one who could fully assure me that this was certain !</p>
   <p>My time is once more expired . I will write to Mr. Cleghorn soon . God bless him and all his concerns ! And may all the powers that preside over conviviality and friendship , be present with all their kindest influence , when the bearer of this , Mr. Syme , and you meet ! I wish I could also make one .</p>

    <note>That Burns turned at this time his thoughts on the drama , this order to his bookseller for dramatic works , as well as his attendances at the Dumfries theatre , afford proof .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , 2d March , 1790 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>At a late meeting of the Monkland Friendly Society , it was resolved to augment their library by the following books , which you are to send us as soon as possible :— The Mirror , The Lounger , Man of Feeling , Man of the World , ( these , for my own sake , I wish to have by the first carrier ) , Knox 's History of the Reformation ; Rae 's History of the Rebellion in 1715 ; any good history of the rebellion in 1745 ; A Display of the Secession Act and Testimony , by Mr. Gibb ; Hervey 's Meditations ; Beveridge 's Thoughts ; and another copy of Watson 's Body of Divinity .</p>
   <p>I wrote to Mr. A. Masterton three or four months ago , to pay some money he owed me into your hands , and lately I wrote to you to the same purpose , but I have heard from neither one or other of you .</p>
   <p>In addition to the books I commissioned in my last , I want very much An Index to the Excise Laws , or an Abridgment of all the Statutes now in force relative to the Excise , by Jellinger Symons ; I want three copies of this book : if it is now to be had , cheap or dear , get it for me . An honest country neighbour of mine wants too a Family Bible , the larger the better ; but second-handed , for he does not choose to give above ten shillings for the book . I want likewise for myself , as you can pick them up , second-handed or cheap , copies of Otway 's Dramatic Works , Ben Jonson 's , Dryden 's , Congreve 's , Wycherley 's , Vanbrugh 's , Cibber 's , or any dramatic works of the more modern , Macklin , Garrick , Foote , Colman , or Sheridan . A good copy too of Moliere , in French , I much want . Any other good dramatic authors in that language I want also ; but comic authors , chiefly , though I should wish to have Racine , Corneille , and Voltaire too . I am in no hurry for all , or any of these , but if you accidentally meet with them very cheap , get them for me .</p>
   <p>And now to quit the dry walk of business , how do you do , my dear friend ? and how is Mrs. Hill ? I trust , if now and then not so elegantly handsome , at least as amiable , and sings as divinely as ever . My good wife too has a charming “ wood-note wild ; ” now could we four ——.</p>
   <p>I am out of all patience with this vile world , for one thing . Mankind are by nature benevolent creatures , except in a few scoundrelly instances . I do not think that avarice of the good things we chance to have , is born with us ; but we are placed here amid so much nakedness , and hunger , and poverty , and want , that we are under a cursed necessity of studying selfishness , in order that we may EXIST ! Still there are , in every age , a few souls , that all the wants and woes of life cannot debase to selfishness , or even to the necessary alloy of caution and prudence . If ever I am in danger of vanity , it is when I contemplate myself on this side of my disposition and character . God knows I am no saint ; I have a whole host of follies and sin , to answer for ; but if I could , and I believe I do it as far as I can , I would wipe away all tears from all eyes .</p>

    <head>TO MRS. DUNLOP .</head>
    <note>It is not a little singular that Burns says , in this letter , he had just met with the Mirror and Lounger for the first time : it will be remembered that a few years before a generous article was dedicated by Mackenzie , the editor , to the Poems of Burns , and to this the poet often alludes in his correspondence .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , 10th April , 1790 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have just now , my ever honoured friend , enjoyed a very high luxury , in reading a paper of the Lounger . You know my national prejudices . I had often read and admired the Spectator , Adventurer , Rambler , and World ; but still with a certain regret , that they were so thoroughly and entirely English . Alas ! have I often said to myself , what are all the boasted advantages which my country reaps from the union , that can counterbalance the annihilation of her independence , and even her very name ! I often repeat that couplet of my favourite poet , Goldsmith —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ ——— States of native liberty possest ,</l>
     <l n="2">Tho ’ very poor , may yet be very blest . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Nothing can reconcile me to the common terms , “ English ambassador , English court , ” &amp; c. And I am out of all patience to see that equivocal character , Hastings , impeached by “ the Commons of England . ” Tell me , my friend , is this weak prejudice ? I believe in my conscience such ideas as “ my country ; her independence ; her honour ; the illustrious names that mark the history of my native land ; ” &amp; c .— I believe these , among your men of the world , men who in fact guide for the most part and govern our world , are looked on as so many modifications of wrongheadedness . They know the use of bawling out such terms , to rouse or lead THE RABBLE ; but for their own private use , with almost all the able statesmen that ever existed , or now exist , when they talk of right and wrong , they only mean proper and improper ; and their measure of conduct is , not what they OUGHT , but what they DARE . For the truth of this I shall not ransack the history of nations , but appeal to one of the ablest judges of men that ever lived — the celebrated Earl of Chesterfield . In fact , a man who could thoroughly control his vices whenever they interfered with his interests , and who could completely put on the appearance of every virtue as often as it suited his purposes , is , on the Stanhopean plan , the perfect man ; a man to lead nations . But are great abilities , complete without a flaw , and polished without a blemish , the standard of human excellence ? This is certainly the staunch opinion of men of the world ; but I call on honour , virtue , and worth , to give the stygian doctrine a loud negative ! However , this must be allowed , that , if you abstract from man the idea of an existence beyond the grave , then the true measure of human conduct is , proper and improper : virtue and vice , as dispositions of the heart , are , in that case , of scarcely the same import and value to the world at large , as harmony and discord in the modifications of sound ; and a delicate sense of honour , like a nice ear for music , though it may sometimes give the possessor an ecstasy unknown to the coarser organs of the herd , yet , considering the harsh gratings , and inharmonic jars , in this ill-tuned state of being , it is odds but the individual would be as happy , and certainly would be as much respected by the true judges of society as it would then stand , without either a good ear or a good heart .</p>
   <p>You must know I have just met with the Mirror and Lounger for the first time , and I am quite in raptures with them ; I should be glad to have your opinion of some of the papers . The one I have just read , Lounger , No . 61 , has cost me more honest tears than anything I have read of a long time . Mackenzie has been called the Addison of the Scots , and in my opinion , Addison would not be hurt at the comparison . If he has not Addison 's exquisite humour , he as certainly outdoes him in the tender and the pathetic . His Man of Feeling ( but I am not counsel learned in the laws of criticism ) I estimate as the first performance in its kind I ever saw . From what book , moral or even pious , will the susceptible young mind receive impressions more congenial to humanity and kindness , generosity and benevolence ; in short , more of all that ennobles the soul to herself , or endears her to others — than from the simple affecting tale of poor Harley ?</p>
   <p>Still , with all my admiration of Mackenzie 's writings , I do not know if they are the fittest reading for a young man who is about to set out , as the phrase is , to make his way into life . Do not you think , Madam , that among the few favoured of heaven in the structure of their minds ( for such there certainly are ) there may be a purity , a tenderness , a dignity , an elegance of soul , which are of no use , nay , in some degree , absolutely disqualifying for the truly important business of making a man 's way into life ? If I am not much mistaken , my gallant young friend , A * * * * * *, is very much under these disqualifications ; and for the young females of a family I could mention , well may they excite parental solicitude , for I , a common acquaintance , or as my vanity will have it , an humble friend , have often trembled for a turn of mind which may render them eminently happy — or peculiarly miserable !</p>
   <p>I have been manufacturing some verses lately ; but when I have got the most hurried season of excise business over , I hope to have more leisure to transcribe anything that may show how much I have the honour to be , Madam ,</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I shall not fail to wait on Captain Riddel to-night — I wish and pray that the goddess of justice herself would appear to-morrow among our hon . gentlemen , merely to give them a word in their ear that mercy to the thief is injustice to the honest man . For my part I have galloped over my ten parishes these four days , until this moment that I am just alighted , or rather , that my poor jackass-skeleton of a horse has let me down ; for the miserable devil has been on his knees half a score of times within the last twenty miles , telling me in his own way , ‘ Behold , am not I thy faithful jade of a horse , on which thou hast ridden these many years ! ’</p>
   <p>In short , Sir , I have broke my horse 's wind , and almost broke my own neck , besides some injuries in a part that shall be nameless , owing to a hard-hearted stone for a saddle . I find that every offender has so many great men to espouse his cause , that I shall not be surprised if I am committed to the strong hold of the law to-morrow for insolence to the dear friends of the gentlemen of the country .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Coming into town this morning , to attend my duty in this office , it being collection-day , I met with a gentleman who tells me he is on his way to London ; so I take the opportunity of writing to you , as franking is at present under a temporary death . I shall have some snatches of leisure through the day , amid our horrid business and bustle , and I shall improve them as well as I can ; but let my letter be as stupid as * * * * * * * * *, as miscellaneous as a newspaper , as short as a hungry grace-before-meat , or as long as a law-paper in the Douglas cause ; as ill-spelt as country John 's billet-doux , or as unsightly a scrawl as Betty Byre-Mucker 's answer to it ; I hope , considering circumstances , you will forgive it ; and as it will put you to no expense of postage , I shall have the less reflection about it .</p>
   <p>I am sadly ungrateful in not returning you my thanks for your most valuable present , Zeluco . In fact , you are in some degree blameable for my neglect . You were pleased to express a wish for my opinion of the work , which so flattered me , that nothing less would serve my overweening fancy , than a formal criticism on the book . In fact , I have gravely planned a comparative view of you , Fielding , Richardson , and Smollett , in your different qualities and merits as novel-writers . This , I own , betrays my ridiculous vanity , and I may probably never bring the business to bear ; and I am fond of the spirit young Elihu shows in the book of Job — “ And I said , I will also declare my opinion , ” I have quite disfigured my copy of the book with my annotations . I never take it up without at the same time taking my pencil , and marking with asterisms , parentheses , &amp; c ., wherever I meet with an original thought , a nervous remark on life and manners , a remarkable well-turned period , or a character sketched with uncommon precision .</p>
   <p>Though I should hardly think of fairly writing out my “ Comparative View , ” I shall certainly trouble you with my remarks , such as they are .</p>
   <p>I have just received from my gentleman that horrid summons in the book of Revelations — “ That time shall be no more ! ”</p>
   <p>The little collection of sonnets have some charming poetry in them . If indeed I am indebted to the fair author for the book , and not , as I rather suspect , to a celebrated author of the other sex , I should certainly have written to the lady , with my grateful acknowledgments , and my own ideas of the comparative excellence of her pieces . I would do this last , not from any vanity of thinking that my remarks could be of much consequence to Mrs. Smith , but merely from my own feelings as an author , doing as I would be done by .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I received a letter from you a long time ago , but unfortunately , as it was in the time of my peregrinations and journeyings through Scotland , I mislaid or lost it , and by consequence your direction along with it . Luckily my good star brought me acquainted with Mr. Kennedy , who , I understand , is an acquaintance of yours : and by his means and mediation I hope to replace that link which my unfortunate negligence had so unluckily broke in the chain of our correspondence . I was the more vexed at the vile accident , as my brother William , a journeyman saddler , has been for some time in London ; and wished above all things for your direction , that he might have paid his respects to his father 's friend .</p>
   <p>His last address he sent me was , “ Wm . Burns , at Mr. Barber 's , saddler , No . 181 , Strand . ” I writ him by Mr. Kennedy , but neglected to ask him for your address ; so , if you find a spare half-minute , please let my brother know by a card where and when he will find you , and the poor fellow will joyfully wait on you , as one of the few surviving friends of the man whose name , and Christian name too , he has the honour to bear .</p>
   <p>The next letter I write you shall be a long one . I have much to tell you of “ hair-breadth ‘ scapes in th ’ imminent deadly breach , ” with all the eventful history of a life , the early years of which owed so much to your kind tutorage ; but this at an hour of leisure . My kindest compliments to Mrs. Murdoch and family .</p>

   <p>After a long day 's toil , plague , and care , I sit down to write to you . Ask me not why I have delayed it so long ! It was owing to hurry , indolence , and fifty other things ; in short to anything — but forgetfulness of la plus aimable de son sexe .

   <p>I laid down my goose-feather to beat my brains for an apt simile , and had some thoughts of a country grannum at a family christening ; a bride on the market-day before her marriage ; or a tavern-keeper at an election-dinner ; but the resemblance that hits my fancy best is , that blackguard miscreant , Satan , who roams about like a roaring lion , seeking , searching whom he may devour . However , tossed about as I am , if I choose ( and who would not choose ) to bind down with the crampets of attention the brazen foundation of integrity , I may rear up the superstructure of Independence , and from its daring turrets bid defiance to the storms of fate . And is not this a “ consummation devoutly to be wished ? ”</p>

I had once a great many of these fragments , and some of these here , entire ; but as I had no idea then that anybody cared for them , I have forgotten them .

     <l n="1">Ellisland , 15th October , 1790 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance the bearer , Mr. Wm . Duncan , a friend of mine , whom I have long known and long loved . His father , whose only son he is , has a decent little property in Ayrshire , and has bred the young man to the law , in which department he comes up an adventurer to your good town . I shall give you my friend 's character in two words : as to his head , he has talents enough , and more than enough for common life ; as to his heart , when nature had kneaded the kindly clay that composes it , she said , “ I can no more . ”</p>
   <p>You , my good Sir , were born under kinder stars ; but your fraternal sympathy , I well know can enter into the feelings of the young man , who goes into life with the laudable ambition to do something , and to be something among his fellow-creatures ; but whom the consciousness of friendless obscurity presses to the earth , and wounds to the soul !</p>
   <p>Even the fairest of his virtues are against him . That independent spirit , and that ingenuous modesty , qualities inseparable from a noble mind , are , with the million , circumstances not a little disqualifying . What pleasure is in the power of the fortunate and the happy , by their notice and patronage , to brighten the countenance and glad the heart of such depressed youth ! I am not so angry with mankind for their deaf economy of the purse :— the goods of this world cannot be divided without being lessened — but why be a niggard of that which bestows bliss on a fellow-creature , yet takes nothing from our own means of enjoyment ? We wrap ourselves up in the cloak of our own better fortune , and turn away our eyes , lest the wants and woes of our brother-mortals should disturb the selfish apathy of our souls !</p>
   <p>I am the worst hand in the world at asking a favour . That indirect address , that insinuating implication , which , without any positive request , plainly expresses your wish , is a talent not to be acquired at a plough-tail . Tell me then , for you can , in what periphrasis of language , in what circumvolution of phrase , I shall envelope , yet not conceal this plain story .— “ My dear Mr. Tait , my friend Mr. Duncan , whom I have the pleasure of introducing to you , is a young lad of your own profession , and a gentleman of much modesty , and great worth . Perhaps it may be in your power to assist him in the , to him , important consideration of getting a place ; but at all events , your notice and acquaintance will be a very great acquisition to him ; and I dare pledge myself that he will never disgrace your favour . ”</p>
   <p>You may possibly be surprised , Sir , at such a letter from me ; ‘ tis , I own , in the usual way of calculating these matters , more than our acquaintance entitles me to ; but my answer is short :— Of all the men at your time of life , whom I knew in Edinburgh , you are the most accessible on the side on which I have assailed you . You are very much altered indeed from what you were when I knew you , if generosity point the path you will not tread , or humanity call to you in vain .</p>
   <p>As to myself , a being to whose interest I believe you are still a well-wisher ; I am here , breathing at all times , thinking sometimes , and rhyming now and then . Every situation has its share of the cares and pains of life , and my situation I am persuaded has a full ordinary allowance of its pleasures and enjoyments .</p>
   <p>My best compliments to your father and Miss Tait . If you have an opportunity , please remember me in the solemn league and covenant of friendship to Mrs. Lewis Hay . I am a wretch for not writing her ; but I am so hackneyed with self-accusation in that way , that my conscience lies in my bosom with scarce the sensibility of an oyster in its shell . Where is Lady M'Kenzie ? wherever she is , God bless her ! I likewise beg leave to trouble you with compliments to Mr. Wm . Hamilton ; Mrs. Hamilton and family ; and Mrs. Chalmers , when you are in that country . Should you meet with Miss Nimmo , please remember me kindly to her .</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>Whether in the way of my trade I can be of any service to the Rev . Doctor , is I fear very doubtful . Ajax 's shield consisted , I think , of seven bull-hides and a plate of brass , which altogether set Hector 's utmost force at defiance . Alas ! I am not a Hector , and the worthy Doctor 's foes are as securely armed as Ajax was . Ignorance , superstition , bigotry , stupidity , malevolence , self-conceit , envy — all strongly bound in a massy frame of brazen impudence . Good God , Sir ! to such a shield , humour is the peck of a sparrow , and satire the pop-gun of a school-boy . Creation-disgracing scelerats such as they , God only can mend , and the devil only can punish . In the comprehending way of Caligula , I wish they all had but one neck . I feel impotent as a child to the ardour of my wishes ! O for a withering curse to blast the germins of their wicked machinations ! O for a poisonous tornado , winged from the torrid zone of Tartarus , to sweep the spreading crop of their villainous contrivances to the lowest hell !</p>

   <p>Fate has long owed me a letter of good news from you , in return for the many tidings of sorrow which I have received . In this instance I most cordially obey the apostle — “ Rejoice with them that do rejoice ” — for me , to sing for joy , is no new thing ; but to preach for joy , as I have done in the commencement of this epistle , is a pitch of extravagant rapture to which I never rose before .</p>
   <p>I read your letter — I literally jumped for joy — How could such a mercurial creature as a poet lumpishly keep his seat on the receipt of the best news from his best friend . I seized my gilt-headed Wangee rod , an instrument indispensably necessary in my left hand , in the moment of inspiration and rapture ; and stride , stride — quick and quicker — out skipt I among the broomy banks of Nith to muse over my joy by retail . To keep within the bounds of prose was impossible . Mrs. Little 's is a more elegant , but not a more sincere compliment to the sweet little fellow , than I , extempore almost , poured out to him in the following verses :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Sweet flow'ret , pledge o ’ meikle love</l>
     <l n="2">And ward o ’ mony a prayer ,</l>

     <l n="8">Should shield thee frae the storm .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am much flattered by your approbation of my Tam o ’ Shanter , which you express in your former letter ; though , by the bye , you load me in that said letter with accusations heavy and many ; to all which I plead , not guilty ! Your book is , I hear , on the road to reach me . As to printing of poetry , when you prepare it for the press , you have only to spell it right , and place the capital letters properly : as to the punctuation , the printers do that themselves .</p>
   <p>I have a copy of Tam o ’ Shanter ready to send you by the first opportunity : it is too heavy to send by post .</p>
   <p>I heard of Mr. Corbet lately . He , in consequence of your recommendation , is most zealous to serve me . Please favour me soon with an account of your good folks ; if Mrs. H. is recovering , and the young gentleman doing well .</p>

May the blood-hounds of misfortune never track his steps , nor the screech-owl of sorrow alarm his dwelling ! May enjoyment tell thy hours , and pleasure number thy days , thou friend of the bard ! “ Blessed be he that blesseth thee , and cursed be he that curseth thee !!! ”</p>
   <p>As a further proof that I am still in the land of existence , I send you a poem , the latest I have composed . I have a particular reason for wishing you only to show it to select friends , should you think it worthy a friend 's perusal ; but if , at your first leisure hour , you will favour me with your opinion of , and strictures on the performance , it will be an additional obligation on , dear Sir , your deeply indebted humble servant ,</p>

   <p>Take these two guineas , and place them over against that d — mned account of yours ! which has gagged my mouth these five or six months ! I can as little write good things as apologies to the man I owe money to . O the supreme curse of making three guineas do the business of five ! Not all the labours of Hercules ; not all the Hebrews ’ three centuries of Egyptian bondage , were such an insuperable business , such an infernal task !! Poverty ! thou half-sister of death , thou cousin-german of hell : where shall I find force of execration equal to the amplitude of thy demerits ? Oppressed by thee , the venerable ancient , grown hoary in the practice of every virtue , laden with years and wretchedness , implores a little — little aid to support his existence , from a stony-hearted son of Mammon , whose sun of prosperity never knew a cloud ; and is by him denied and insulted . Oppressed by thee , the man of sentiment , whose heart glows with independence , and melts with sensibility , inly pines under the neglect , or writhes in bitterness of soul , under the contumely of arrogant , unfeeling wealth . Oppressed by thee , the son of genius , whose ill-starred ambition plants him at the tables of the fashionable and polite , must see in suffering silence , his remark neglected , and his person despised , while shallow greatness in his idiot attempts at wit , shall meet with countenance and applause . Nor is it only the family of worth that have reason to complain of thee : the children of folly and vice , though in common with thee the offspring of evil , smart equally under thy rod . Owing to thee , the man of unfortunate disposition and neglected education , is condemned as a fool for his dissipation , despised and shunned as a needy wretch , when his follies as usual bring him to want ; and when his unprincipled necessities drive him to dishonest practices , he is abhorred as a miscreant , and perishes by the justice of his country . But far otherwise is the lot of the man of family and fortune . His early follies and extravagance , are spirit and fire ; his consequent wants are the embarrassments of an honest fellow ; and when , to remedy the matter , he has gained a legal commission to plunder distant provinces , or massacre peaceful nations , he returns , perhaps , laden with the spoils of rapine and murder ; lives wicked and respected , and dies a scoundrel and a lord .— Nay , worst of all , alas for helpless woman ! the needy prostitute , who has shivered at the corner of the street , waiting to earn the wages of casual prostitution , is left neglected and insulted , ridden down by the chariot wheels of the coroneted RIP , hurrying on to the guilty assignation ; she who without the same necessities to plead , riots nightly in the same guilty trade .</p>
   <p>Well ! divines may say of it what they please ; but execration is to the mind what phlebotomy is to the body : the vital sluices of both are wonderfully relieved by their respective evacuations .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Nothing less than the unfortunate accident I have met with , could have prevented my grateful acknowledgments for your letter . His own favourite poem , and that an essay in the walk of the muses entirely new to him , where consequently his hopes and fears were on the most anxious alarm for his success in the attempt ; to have that poem so much applauded by one of the first judges , was the most delicious vibration that ever thrilled along the heart-strings of a poor poet . However , Providence , to keep up the proper proportion of evil with the good , which it seems is necessary in this sublunary state , thought proper to check my exultation by a very serious misfortune . A day or two after I received your letter , my horse came down with me and broke my right arm . As this is the first service my arm has done me since its disaster , I find myself unable to do more than just in general terms thank you for this additional instance of your patronage and friendship . As to the faults you detected in the piece , they are truly there : one of them , the hit at the lawyer and priest , I shall cut out ; as to the falling off in the catastrophe , for the reason you justly adduce , it cannot easily be remedied . Your approbation , Sir , has given me such additional spirits to persevere in this species of poetic composition , that I am already revolving two or three stories in my fancy . If I can bring these floating ideas to bear any kind of embodied form , it will give me additional opportunity of assuring you how much I have the honour to be , &amp; c .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>When I tell you , Madam , that by a fall , not from my horse , but with my horse , I have been a cripple some time , and that this is the first day my arm and hand have been able to serve me in writing ; you will allow that it is too good an apology for my seemingly ungrateful silence . I am now getting better , and am able to rhyme a little , which implies some tolerable ease , as I cannot think that the most poetic genius is able to compose on the rack .</p>
   <p>I do not remember if ever I mentioned to you my having an idea of composing an elegy on the late Miss Burnet , of Monboddo . I had the honour of being pretty well acquainted with her , and have seldom felt so much at the loss of an acquaintance , as when I heard that so amiable and accomplished a piece of God 's work was no more . I have , as yet , gone no farther than the following fragment , of which please let me have your opinion . You know that elegy is a subject so much exhausted , that any new idea on the business is not to be expected : ‘ tis well if we can place an old idea in a new light . How far I have succeeded as to this last , you will judge from what follows . I have proceeded no further .</p>
   <p>Your kind letter , with your kind remembrance of your godson , came safe . This last , Madam , is scarcely what my pride can bear . As to the little fellow , he is , partiality apart , the finest boy I have for a long time seen . He is now seventeen months old , has the small-pox and measles over , has cut several teeth , and never had a grain of doctor 's drugs in his bowels .</p>
   <p>I am truly happy to hear that the “ little floweret ” is blooming so fresh and fair , and that the “ mother plant ” is rather recovering her drooping head . Soon and well may her “ cruel wounds ” be healed . I have written thus far with a good deal of difficulty . When I get a little abler you shall hear farther from ,</p>

    <head>SIR ,</head>
    <head>You must by this time have set me down as one of the most ungrateful of men . You did me the honour to present me with a book , which does honour to science and the intellectual powers of man , and I have not even so much as acknowledged the receipt of it . The fact is , you yourself are to blame for it . Flattered as I was by your telling me that you wished to have my opinion of the work , the old spiritual enemy of mankind , who knows well that vanity is one of the sins that most easily beset me , put it into my head to ponder over the performance with the look-out of a critic , and to draw up forsooth a deep learned digest of strictures on a composition , of which , in fact , until I read the book , I did not even know the first principles . I own , Sir , that at first glance , several of your propositions startled me as paradoxical . That the martial clangour of a trumpet had something in it vastly more grand , heroic , and sublime , than the twingle twangle of a jew'shYpppHeNharp : that the delicate flexure of a rose-twig , when the half-blown flower is heavy with the tears of the dawn , was infinitely more beautiful and elegant than the upright stub of a burdock ; and that from something innate and independent of all associations of ideas ;— these I had set down as irrefragable , orthodox truths , until perusing your book shook my faith .— In short , Sir , except Euclid 's Elements of Geometry , which I made a shift to unravel by my father 's fire-side , in the winter evening of the first season I held the plough , I never read a book which gave me such a quantum of information , and added so much to my stock of ideas , as your “ Essays on the Principles of Taste . ” One thing , Sir , you must forgive my mentioning as an uncommon merit in the work , I mean the language . To clothe abstract philosophy in elegance of style , sounds something like a contradiction in terms ; but you have convinced me that they are quite compatible .</head>

    <head>TO DR. MOORE .</head>
    <note>Moore admired but moderately the beautiful ballad on Queen Mary , and the Elegy on Captain Matthew Henderson : Tam o ’ Shanter he thought full of poetical beauties .— He again regrets that he writes in the language of Scotland .</note>

   <p>I do not know , Sir , whether you are a subscriber to Grose 's Antiquities of Scotland . If you are , the enclosed poem will not be altogether new to you . Captain Grose did me the favour to send me a dozen copies of the proof sheet , of which this is one . Should you have read the piece before , still this will answer the principal end I have in view : it will give me another opportunity of thanking you for all your goodness to the rustic bard ; and also of showing you , that the abilities you have been pleased to commend and patronize are still employed in the way you wish .</p>
   <p>The Elegy on Captain Henderson , is a tribute to the memory of a man I loved much . Poets have in this the same advantage as Roman Catholics ; they can be of service to their friends after they have passed that bourne where all other kindness ceases to be of avail . Whether , after all , either the one or the other be of any real service to the dead , is , I fear , very problematical ; but I am sure they are highly gratifying to the living : and as a very orthodox text , I forget where in scripture , says , “ whatsoever is not of faith is sin ; ” so say I , whatsoever is not detrimental to society , and is of positive enjoyment , is of God , the giver of all good things , and ought to be received and enjoyed by his creatures with thankful delight . As almost all my religious tenets originate from my heart , I am wonderfully pleased with the idea , that I can still keep up a tender intercourse with the dearly beloved friend , or still more dearly beloved mistress , who is gone to the world of spirits .</p>
   <p>The ballad on Queen Mary was begun while I was busy with Percy 's Reliques of English Poetry . By the way , how much is every honest heart , which has a tincture of Caledonian prejudice , obliged to you for your glorious story of Buchanan and Targe ! ‘ Twas an unequivocal proof of your loyal gallantry of soul , giving Targe the victory . I should have been mortified to the ground if you had not .</p>
   <p>I have just read over , once more of many times , your Zeluco . I marked with my pencil , as I went along , every passage that pleased me particularly above the rest ; and one or two , I think , which with humble deference , I am disposed to think unequal to the merits of the book . I have sometimes thought to transcribe these marked passages , or at least so much of them as to point where they are , and send them to you . Original strokes that strongly depict the human heart , is your and Fielding 's province beyond any other novelist I have ever perused . Richardson indeed might perhaps be excepted ; but unhappily , dramatis personæ are beings of another world ; and however they may captivate the unexperienced , romantic fancy of a boy or a girl , they will ever , in proportion as we have made human nature our study , dissatisfy our riper years .</p>
   <p>As to my private concerns , I am going on , a mighty tax-gatherer before the Lord , and have lately had the interest to get myself ranked on the list of excise as a supervisor . I am not yet employed as such , but in a few years I shall fall into the file of supervisorship by seniority . I have had an immense loss in the death of the Earl of Glencairn ; the patron from whom all my fame and fortune took its rise . Independent of my grateful attachment to him , which was indeed so strong that it pervaded my very soul , and was entwined with the thread of my existence : so soon as the prince 's friends had got in ( and every dog you know has his day ) , my getting forward in the excise would have been an easier business than otherwise it will be . Though this was a consummation devoutly to be wished , yet , thank Heaven , I can live and rhyme as I am : and as to my boys , poor little fellows ! if I cannot place them on as high an elevation in life , as I could wish , I shall , if I am favoured so much of the Disposer of events as to see that period , fix them on as broad and independent a basis as possible . Among the many wise adages which have been treasured up by our Scottish ancestors , this is one of the best , Better be the head o ’ the commonalty , than the tail o ’ the gentry .</p>
   <p>But I am got on a subject , which however interesting to me , is of no manner of consequence to you ; so I shall give you a short poem on the other page , and close this with assuring you how sincerely I have the honour to be ,</p>
   <p>Yours , &amp; c .</p>

   <p>If the foregoing piece be worth your strictures , let me have them . For my own part , a thing that I have just composed always appears through a double portion of that partial medium in which an author will ever view his own works . I believe in general , novelty has something in it that inebriates the fancy , and not unfrequently dissipates and fumes away like other intoxication , and leaves the poor patient , as usual , with an aching heart . A striking instance of this might be adduced , in the revolution of many a hymeneal honeymoon . But lest I sink into stupid prose , and so sacrilegiously intrude on the office of my parish-priest , I shall fill up the page in my own way , and give you another song of my late composition , which will appear perhaps in Johnson 's work , as well as the former .</p>
   <p>You must know a beautiful Jacobite air , There 'll never be peace ‘ till Jamie comes hame . When political combustion ceases to be the object of princes and patriots , it then you know becomes the lawful prey of historians and poets .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">By yon castle wa ’ at the close of the day ,</l>
     <l n="2">I heard a man sing , tho ’ his head it was grey ;</l>
     <l n="3">And as he was singing , the tears fast down came —</l>
     <l n="4">There 'll never be peace till Jamie comes hame .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If you like the air , and if the stanzas hit your fancy , you cannot imagine , my dear friend , how much you would oblige me , if by the charms of your delightful voice , you would give my honest effusion to “ the memory of joys that are past , ” to the few friends whom you indulge in that pleasure . But I have scribbled on ‘ till I hear the clock has intimated the near approach of</p>
   <p>That hour , o ’ night 's black arch the key-stane .—</p>
   <p>So good night to you ! Sound be your sleep , and delectable your dreams ! Apropos , how do you like this thought in a ballad , I have just now on the tapis ?</p>

    <head>TO MR. ALEXANDER DALZEL ,</head>
    <head>FACTOR , FINDLAYSTON .</head>
    <note>Cromek says that Alexander Dalzel introduced the poetry of Burns to the notice of the Earl of Glencairn , who carried the Kilmarnock edition with him to Edinburgh , and begged that the poet would let him know what his views in the world were , that he might further them .</note>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have taken the liberty to frank this letter to you , as it encloses an idle poem of mine , which I send you ; and God knows you may perhaps pay dear enough for it if you read it through . Not that this is my own opinion ; but the author , by the time he has composed and corrected his work , has quite pored away all his powers of critical discrimination .</p>
   <p>I can easily guess from my own heart , what you have felt on a late most melancholy event . God knows what I have suffered , at the loss of my best friend , my first and dearest patron and benefactor ; the man to whom I owe all that I am and have ! I am gone into mourning for him , and with more sincerity of grief than I fear some will , who by nature 's ties ought to feel on the occasion .</p>
   <p>I will be exceedingly obliged to you , indeed , to let me know the news of the noble family , how the poor mother and the two sisters support their loss . I had a packet of poetic bagatelles ready to send to Lady Betty , when I saw the fatal tidings in the newspaper . I see by the same channel that the honoured REMAINS of my noble patron , are designed to be brought to the family burial-place . Dare I trouble you to let me know privately before the day of interment , that I may cross the country , and steal among the crowd , to pay a tear to the last sight of my ever revered benefactor ? It will oblige me beyond expression .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Whether it is that the story of our Mary Queen of Scots has a peculiar effect on the feelings of a poet , or whether I have , in the enclosed ballad , succeeded beyond my usual poetic success , I know not ; but it has pleased me beyond any effort of my muse for a good while past ; on that account I enclose it particularly to you . It is true , the purity of my motives may be suspected . I am already deeply indebted to Mr. Graham 's goodness ; and what , in the usual ways of men , is of infinitely greater importance , Mr. G. can do me service of the utmost importance in time to come . I was born a poor dog ; and however I may occasionally pick a better bone than I used to do , I know I must live and die poor : but I will indulge the flattering faith that my poetry will considerably outlive my poverty ; and without any fustian affectation of spirit , I can promise and affirm , that it must be no ordinary craving of the latter shall ever make me do anything injurious to the honest fame of the former . Whatever may be my failings , for failings are a part of human nature , may they ever be those of a generous heart , and an independent mind ! It is no fault of mine that I was born to dependence ; nor is it Mr. Graham 's chiefest praise that he can command influence ; but it is his merit to bestow , not only with the kindness of a brother , but with the politeness of a gentleman ; and I trust it shall be mine , to receive with thankfulness , and remember with undiminished gratitude .</p>

   <note>The following letter was written on the blank leaf of a new edition of his poems , presented by the poet , to one whom he regarded , and justly , as a patroness .</note>
   <p>It is probable , Madam , that this page may be read , when the hand that now writes it shall be mouldering in the dust : may it then bear witness , that I present you these volumes as a tribute of gratitude , on my part ardent and sincere , as your and Mr. Graham 's goodness to me has been generous and noble ! May every child of yours , in the hour of need , find such a friend as I shall teach every child of mine , that their father found in you .</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . G. BAIRD .</head>
    <note>It was proposed to publish a new edition of the poems of Michael Bruce , by subscription , and give the profits to his mother , a woman eighty years old , and poor and helpless , and Burns was asked for a poem to give a new impulse to the publication .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>REVEREND SIR ,</p>
   <p>Why did you , my dear Sir , write to me in such a hesitating style on the business of poor Bruce ? Do n't I know , and have I not felt , the many ills , the peculiar ills that poetic flesh is heir to ? You shall have your choice of all the unpublished poems I have ; and had your letter had my direction , so as to have reached me sooner ( it only came to my hand this moment ) , I should have directly put you out of suspense on the subject . I only ask , that some prefatory advertisement in the book , as well as the subscription bills , may bear , that the publication is solely for the benefit of Bruce 's mother . I would not put it in the power of ignorance to surmise , or malice to insinuate , that I clubbed a share in the work from mercenary motives . Nor need you give me credit for any remarkable generosity in my part of the business . I have such a host of peccadilloes , failings , follies , and backslidings ( anybody but myself might perhaps give some of them a worse appellation ) , that by way of some balance , however trifling , in the account , I am fain to do any good that occurs in my very limited power to a fellow-creature , just for the selfish purpose of clearing a little the vista of retrospection .</p>

    <head>CCXV .</head>
    <head>TO MRS. DUNLOP .</head>
    <note>Francis Wallace Burns , the godson of Mrs. Dunlop , to whom this letter refers , died at the age of fourteen — he was a fine and a promising youth .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , 11th April , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am once more able , my honoured friend , to return you , with my own hand , thanks for the many instances of your friendship , and particularly for your kind anxiety in this last disaster , that my evil genius had in store for me . However , life is chequered — joy and sorrow — for on Saturday morning last , Mrs. Burns made me a present of a fine boy ; rather stouter , but not so handsome as your godson was at his time of life . Indeed I look on your little namesake to be my chef d'oeuvre in that species of manufacture , as I look on Tam o ’ Shanter to be my standard performance in the poetical line . ‘ Tis true , both the one and the other discover a spice of roguish waggery , that might perhaps be as well spared ; but then they also show , in my opinion , a force of genius and a finishing polish that I despair of ever excelling . Mrs. Burns is getting stout again , and laid as lustily about her to-day at breakfast , as a reaper from the corn-ridge . That is the peculiar privilege and blessing of our hale , sprightly damsels , that are bred among the hay and heather . We cannot hope for that highly polished mind , that charming delicacy of soul , which is found among the female world in the more elevated stations of life , and which is certainly by far the most bewitching charm in the famous cestus of Venus . It is indeed such an inestimable treasure , that where it can be had in its native heavenly purity , unstained by some one or other of the many shades of affectation , and unalloyed by some one or other of the many species of caprice , I declare to Heaven , I should think it cheaply purchased at the expense of every other earthly good ! But as this angelic creature is , I am afraid , extremely rare in any station and rank of life , and totally denied to such a humble one as mine , we meaner mortals must put up with the next rank of female excellence — as fine a figure and face we can produce as any rank of life whatever ; rustic , native grace ; unaffected modesty , and unsullied purity ; nature 's mother-wit , and the rudiments of taste ; a simplicity of soul , unsuspicious of , because unacquainted with , the crooked ways of a selfish , interested , disingenuous world ; and the dearest charm of all the rest , a yielding sweetness of disposition , and a generous warmth of heart , grateful for love on our part , and ardently glowing with a more than equal return ; these , with a healthy frame , a sound , vigorous constitution , which your higher ranks can scarcely ever hope to enjoy , are the charms of lovely woman in my humble walk of life .</p>
   <p>This is the greatest effort my broken arm has yet made . Do let me hear , by first post , how cher petit Monsieur comes on with his small-pox . May almighty goodness preserve and restore him !</p>

   <p>Thou eunuch of language : thou Englishman , who never was south the Tweed : thou servile echo of fashionable barbarisms : thou quack , vending the nostrums of empirical elocution : thou marriage-maker between vowels and consonants , on the Gretna-green of caprice : thou cobler , botching the flimsy socks of bombast oratory : thou blacksmith , hammering the rivets of absurdity : thou butcher , imbruing thy hands in the bowels of orthography : thou arch-heretic in pronunciation : thou pitch-pipe of affected emphasis : thou carpenter , mortising the awkward joints of jarring sentences : thou squeaking dissonance of cadence : thou pimp of gender : thou Lion Herald to silly etymology : thou antipode of grammar : thou executioner of construction : thou brood of the speech-distracting builders of the Tower of Babel ; thou lingual confusion worse confounded : thou scape-gallows from the land of syntax : thou scavenger of mood and tense : thou murderous accoucheur of infant learning ; thou ignis fatuus , misleading the steps of benighted ignorance : thou pickle-herring in the puppet-show of nonsense : thou faithful recorder of barbarous idiom : thou persecutor of syllabication : thou baleful meteor , foretelling and facilitating the rapid approach of Nox and Erebus .</p>

    <note>To Clarke , the Schoolmaster , Burns , it is said , addressed several letters , which on his death were put into the fire by his widow , because of their license of language .</note>
     <l n="1">11th June , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Let me interest you , my dear Cunningham , in behalf of the gentleman who waits on you with this . He is a Mr. Clarke , of Moffat , principal schoolmaster there , and is at present suffering severely under the persecution of one or two powerful individuals of his employers . He is accused of harshness to boys that were placed under his care . God help the teacher , if a man of sensibility and genius , and such is my friend Clarke , when a booby father presents him with his booby son , and insists on lighting up the rays of science , in a fellow 's head whose skull is impervious and inaccessible by any other way than a positive fracture with a cudgel : a fellow whom in fact it savours of impiety to attempt making a scholar of , as he has been marked a blockhead in the book of fate , at the almighty fiat of his Creator .</p>
   <p>The patrons of Moffat-school are , the ministers , magistrates , and town-council of Edinburgh , and as the business comes now before them , let me beg my dearest friend to do everything in his power to serve the interests of a man of genius and worth , and a man whom I particularly respect and esteem . You know some good fellows among the magistracy and council , but particularly you have much to say with a reverend gentleman to whom you have the honour of being very nearly related , and whom this country and age have had the honour to produce . I need not name the historian of Charles V. I tell him through the medium of his nephew 's influence , that Mr. Clarke is a gentleman who will not disgrace even his patronage . I know the merits of the cause thoroughly , and say it , that my friend is falling a sacrifice to prejudiced ignorance .</p>
   <p>God help the children of dependence ! Hated and persecuted by their enemies , and too often , alas ! almost unexceptionably , received by their friends with disrespect and reproach , under the thin disguise of cold civility and humiliating advice . O ! to be a sturdy savage , stalking in the pride of his independence , amid the solitary wilds of his deserts ; rather than in civilized life , helplessly to tremble for a subsistence , precarious as the caprice of a fellow-creature ! Every man has his virtues , and no man is without his failings ; and curse on that privileged plain-dealing of friendship , which , in the hour of my calamity , cannot reach forth the helping hand without at the same time pointing out those failings , and apportioning them their share in procuring my present distress . My friends , for such the world calls ye , and such ye think yourselves to be , pass by my virtues if you please , but do , also , spare my follies : the first will witness in my breast for themselves , and the last will give pain enough to the ingenuous mind without you . And since deviating more or less from the paths of propriety and rectitude , must be incident to human nature , do thou , Fortune , put it in my power , always from myself , and of myself , to bear the consequence of those errors ! I do not want to be independent that I may sin , but I want to be independent in my sinning .</p>
   <p>To return in this rambling letter to the subject I set out with , let me recommend my friend , Mr. Clarke , to your acquaintance and good offices ; his worth entitles him to the one , and his gratitude will merit the other . I long much to hear from you .</p>

    <note>Lord Buchan printed this letter in his Essay on the Life of Thomson , in 1792 . His lordship invited Burns to leave his corn unreaped , walk from Ellisland to Dryburgh , and help him to crown Thomson 's bust with bays , on Ednam Hill , on the 22d of September .</note>
     <l n="1">Ellisland , August 29th , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>Language sinks under the ardour of my feelings when I would thank your lordship for the honour you have done me in inviting me to make one at the coronation of the bust of Thomson . In my first enthusiasm in reading the card you did me the honour to write me , I overlooked every obstacle , and determined to go ; but I fear it will not be in my power . A week or two 's absence , in the very middle of my harvest , is what I much doubt I dare not venture on . I once already made a pilgrimage up the whole course of the Tweed , and fondly would I take the same delightful journey down the windings of that delightful stream .</p>
   <p>Your lordship hints at an ode for the occasion : but who would write after Collins ? I read over his verses to the memory of Thomson , and despaired .— I got indeed to the length of three or four stanzas , in the way of address to the shade of the bard , on crowning his bust . I shall trouble your lordship with the subjoined copy of them , which , I am afraid , will be but too convincing a proof how unequal I am to the task . However , it affords me an opportunity of approaching your lordship , and declaring how sincerely and gratefully I have the honour to be , &amp; c .,</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SLOAN ,</p>
   <p>Suspense is worse than disappointment , for that reason I hurry to tell you that I just now learn that Mr. Ballantyne does not choose to interfere more in the business . I am truly sorry for it , but cannot help it .</p>
   <p>You blame me for not writing you sooner , but you will please to recollect that you omitted one little necessary piece of information ;— your address .</p>
   <p>However , you know equally well , my hurried life , indolent temper , and strength of attachment . It must be a longer period than the longest life “ in the world 's hale and undegenerate days , ” that will make me forget so dear a friend as Mr. Sloan . I am prodigal enough at times , but I will not part with such a treasure as that .</p>

   <p>I have nothing new to tell you . The few friends we have are going on in the old way . I sold my crop on this day se'ennight , and sold it very well . A guinea an acre , on an average , above value . But such a scene of drunkenness was hardly ever seen in this country . After the roup was over , about thirty people engaged in a battle , every man for his own hand , and fought it out for three hours . Nor was the scene much better in the house . No fighting , indeed , but folks lying drunk on the floor , and decanting , until both my dogs got so drunk by attending them , that they could not stand . You will easily guess how I enjoyed the scene ; as I was no farther over than you used to see me .</p>

    <note>The poem enclosed was the Lament for James , Earl of Glencairn : it is probable that the Earl 's sister liked the verses , for they were printed soon afterwards .</note>
    <p>MY LADY ,</p>
    <p>I would , as usual , have availed myself of the privilege your goodness has allowed me , of sending you anything I compose in my poetical way ; but as I had resolved , so soon as the shock of my irreparable loss would allow me , to pay a tribute to my late benefactor , I determined to make that the first piece I should do myself the honour of sending you . Had the wing of my fancy been equal to the ardour of my heart , the enclosed had been much more worthy your perusal : as it is , I beg leave to lay it at your ladyship 's feet . As all the world knows my obligations to the late Earl of Glencairn , I would wish to show as openly that my heart glows , and will ever glow , with the most grateful sense and remembrance of his lordship 's goodness . The sables I did myself the honour to wear to his lordship 's memory , were not the “ mockery of woe . ” Nor shall my gratitude perish with me !— if among my children I shall have a son that has a heart , he shall hand it down to his child as a family honour , and a family debt , that my dearest existence I owe to the noble house of Glencairn !</p>

   <p>MY DEAR AINSLIE ,</p>
   <p>Can you minister to a mind diseased ? can you , amid the horrors of penitence , remorse , head-ache , nausea , and all the rest of the d —— d hounds of hell , that beset a poor wretch , who has been guilty of the sin of drunkenness — can you speak peace to a troubled soul ?</p>
   <p>Miserable perdu that I am , I have tried everything that used to amuse me , but in vain : here must I sit , a monument of the vengeance laid up in store for the wicked , slowly counting every chick of the clock as it slowly , slowly , numbers over these lazy scoundrels of hours , who , d —— n them , are ranked up before me , every one at his neighbour 's backside , and every one with a burthen of anguish on his back , to pour on my devoted head — and there is none to pity me . My wife scolds me ! my business torments me , and my sins come staring me in the face , every one telling a more bitter tale than his fellow .— When I tell you even * * * has lost its power to please , you will guess something of my hell within , and all around me — I begun Elibanks and Elibraes , but the stanzas fell unenjoyed , and unfinished from my listless tongue : at last I luckily thought of reading over an old letter of yours , that lay by me in my book-case , and I felt something for the first time since I opened my eyes , of pleasurable existence . —— Well — I begin to breathe a little , since I began to write to you . How are you , and what are you doing ? How goes Law ? Apropos , for connexion 's sake , do not address to me supervisor , for that is an honour I cannot pretend to — I am on the list , as we call it , for a supervisor , and will be called out by and bye to act as one ; but at present , I am a simple gauger , tho ’ t'other day I got an appointment to an excise division of 25l . per annum better than the rest . My present income , down money , is 70l . per annum .</p>
   <p>I have one or two good fellows here whom you would be glad to know .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have just this minute got the frank , and next minute must send it to post , else I purposed to have sent you two or three other bagatelles , that might have amused a vacant hour about as well as “ Six excellent new songs , ” or , the Aberdeen ‘ Prognostication for the year to come . ’ I shall probably trouble you soon with another packet . About the gloomy month of November , when ‘ the people of England hang and drown themselves , ’ anything generally is better than one 's own thought .</p>
   <p>Fond as I may be of my own productions , it is not for their sake that I am so anxious to send you them . I am ambitious , covetously ambitious of being known to a gentleman whom I am proud to call my countryman ; a gentleman who was a foreign ambassador as soon as he was a man , and a leader of armies as soon as he was a soldier , and that with an eclat unknown to the usual minions of a court , men who , with all the adventitious advantages of princely connexions and princely fortune , must yet , like the caterpillar , labour a whole lifetime before they reach the wished height , there to roost a stupid chrysalis , and doze out the remaining glimmering existence of old age .</p>
   <p>If the gentleman who accompanied you when you did me the honour of calling on me , is with you , I beg to be respectfully remembered to him .</p>
   <p>I have the honour to be ,</p>
   <p>Sir ,</p>
   <p>Your highly obliged , and most devoted</p>
   <p>Humble servant ,</p>
   <p>R. B .</p>
   <p>CCXXIV .</p>
   <p>TO MISS DAVIES .</p>
   <note>This accomplished lady was the youngest daughter of Dr. Davies , of Tenby , in Pembrokeshire : she was related to the Riddels of Friar 's Carse , and one of her sisters married Captain Adam Gordon , of the noble family of Kenmure . She had both taste and skill in verse .</note>
   <p>It is impossible , Madam , that the generous warmth and angelic purity of your youthful mind , can have any idea of that moral disease under which I unhappily must rank us the chief of sinners ; I mean a torpitude of the moral powers , that may be called , a lethargy of conscience . In vain Remorse rears her horrent crest , and rouses all her snakes ; beneath the deadly fixed eye and leaden hand of Indolence , their wildest ire is charmed into the torpor of the bat , slumbering out the rigours of winter , in the chink of a ruined wall . Nothing less , Madam , could have made me so long neglect your obliging commands . Indeed I had one apology — the bagatelle was not worth presenting . Besides , so strongly am I interested in Miss Davies 's fate and welfare in the serious business of life , amid its chances and changes , that to make her the subject of a silly ballad is downright mockery of these ardent feelings ; ‘ tis like an impertinent jest to a dying friend .</p>
   <p>Gracious Heaven ! why this disparity between our wishes and our powers ? Why is the most generous wish to make others blest , impotent and ineffectual — as the idle breeze that crosses the pathless desert ! In my walks of life I have met with a few people to whom how gladly would I have said — “ Go , be happy ! I know that your hearts have been wounded by the scorn of the proud , whom accident has placed above you — or worse still , in whose hands are , perhaps , placed many of the comforts of your life . But there ! ascend that rock , Independence , and look justly down on their littleness of soul . Make the worthless tremble under your indignation , and the foolish sink before your contempt ; and largely impart that happiness to others , which , I am certain , will give yourselves so much pleasure to bestow . ”</p>
   <p>Why , dear Madam , must I wake from this delightful revery , and find it all a dream ? Why , amid my generous enthusiasm , must I , find myself poor and powerless , incapable of wiping one tear from the eye of pity , or of adding one comfort to the friend I love !— Out upon the world , say I , that its affairs are administered so ill ! They talk of reform ;— good Heaven ! what a reform would I make among the sons and even the daughters of men !— Down , immediately , should go fools from the high places , where misbegotten chance has perked them up , and through life should they skulk , ever haunted by their native insignificance , as the body marches accompanied by its shadow .— As for a much more formidable class , the knaves , I am at a loss what to do with them : had I a world , there should not be a knave in it .</p>
   <p>But the hand that could give , I would liberally fill : and I would pour delight on the heart that could kindly forgive , and generously love .</p>
   <p>Still the inequalities of life are , among men , comparatively tolerable — but there is a delicacy , a tenderness , accompanying every view in which we can place lovely Woman , that are grated and shocked at the rude , capricious distinctions of fortune . Woman is the blood-royal of life : let there be slight degrees of precedency among them — but let them be ALL sacred .— Whether this last sentiment be right or wrong , I am not accountable ; it is an original component feature of my mind .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Many thanks to you , Madam , for your good news respecting the little floweret and the mother-plant . I hope my poetic prayers have been heard , and will be answered up to the warmest sincerity of their fullest extent ; and then Mrs. Henri will find her little darling the representative of his late parent , in everything but his abridged existence .</p>
   <p>I have just finished the following song , which to a lady the descendant of Wallace — and many heroes of his true illustrious line — and herself the mother of several soldiers , needs neither preface nor apology .</p>
   <p>Scene — a field of battle — time of the day , evening ; the wounded and dying of the victorious army are supposed to join in the following</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>SONG OF DEATH .</head>
     <l n="1">Farewell , thou fair day , thou green earth , and ye skies</l>

     <l n="3">Farewell , loves and friendships , ye dear tender ties —</l>
     <l n="4">Our race of existence is run !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The circumstance that gave rise to the foregoing verses was , looking over with a musical friend M'Donald ' s collection of Highland airs , I was struck with one , an Isle of Skye tune , entitled “ Oran and Aoig , or , The Song of Death , ” to the measure of which I have adapted my stanzas . I have of late composed two or three other little pieces , which , ere yon full-orbed moon , whose broad impudent face now stares at old mother earth all night , shall have shrunk into a modest crescent , just peeping forth at dewy dawn , I shall find an hour to transcribe for you . A Dieu je vous commende .</p>

     <l n="1">5th January , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You see my hurried life , Madam : I can only command starts of time ; however , I am glad of one thing ; since I finished the other sheet , the political blast that threatened my welfare is overblown . I have corresponded with Commissioner Graham , for the board had made me the subject of their animadversions ; and now I have the pleasure of informing you , that all is set to rights in that quarter . Now as to these informers , may the devil be let loose to —— but , hold ! I was praying most fervently in my last sheet , and I must not so soon fall a swearing in this .</p>
   <p>Alas ! how little do the wantonly or idly officious think what mischief they do by their malicious insinuations , indirect impertinence , or thoughtless blabbings . What a difference there is in intrinsic worth , candour , benevolence , generosity , kindness ,— in all the charities and all the virtues , between one class of human beings and another ! For instance , the amiable circle I so lately mixed with in the hospitable hall of Dunlop , their generous hearts — their uncontaminated dignified minds — their informed and polished understandings — what a contrast , when compared — if such comparing were not downright sacrilege — with the soul of the miscreant who can deliberately plot the destruction of an honest man that never offended him , and with a grin of satisfaction see the unfortunate being , his faithful wife , and prattling innocents , turned over to beggary and ruin !</p>
   <p>Your cup , my dear Madam , arrived safe . I had two worthy fellows dining with me the other day , when I , with great formality , produced my whigmeeleerie cup , and told them that it had been a family-piece among the descendants of William Wallace . This roused such an enthusiasm , that they insisted on bumpering the punch round in it ; and by and by , never did your great ancestor lay a Suthron more completely to rest , than for a time did your cup my two friends . Apropos , this is the season of wishing . My God bless you , my dear friend , and bless me , the humblest and sincerest of your friends , by granting you yet many returns of the season ! May all good things attend you and yours wherever they are scattered over the earth !</p>

   <p>I sit down , my dear Sir , to introduce a young lady to you , and a lady in the first ranks of fashion too . What a task ! to you — who care no more for the herd of animals called young ladies , than you do for the herd of animals called young gentlemen . To you — who despise and detest the groupings and combinations of fashion , as an idiot painter that seems industrious to place staring fools and unprincipled knaves in the foreground of his picture , while men of sense and honesty are too often thrown in the dimmest shades . Mrs. Riddel , who will take this letter to town with her , and send it to you , is a character that , even in your own way , as a naturalist and a philosopher , would be an acquisition to your acquaintance . The lady , too , is a votary to the muses ; and as I think myself somewhat of a judge in my own trade , I assure you that her verses , always correct , and often elegant , are much beyond the common run of the lady-poetesses of the day . She is a great admirer of your book ; and , hearing me say that I was acquainted with you , she begged to be known to you , as she is just going to pay her first visit to our Caledonian capital . I told her that her best way was , to desire her near relation , and your intimate friend , Craigdarroch , to have you at his house while she was there ; and lest you might think of a lively West Indian girl , of eighteen , as girls of eighteen too often deserve to be thought of , I should take care to remove that prejudice . To be impartial , however , in appreciating the lady 's merits , she has one unlucky failing : a failing which you will easily discover , as she seems rather pleased with indulging in it ; and a failing that you will easily pardon , as it is a sin which very much besets yourself ;— where she dislikes , or despises , she is apt to make no more a secret of it , than where she esteems and respects .</p>
   <p>I will not present you with the unmeaning compliments of the season , but I will send you my warmest wishes and most ardent prayers , that Fortune may never throw your subsistence to the mercy of a Knave , or set your character on the judgment of a Fool ; but that , upright and erect , you may walk to an honest grave , where men of letters shall say , here lies a man who did honour to science , and men of worth shall say , here lies a man who did honour to human nature .</p>

   <p>O thou , wisest among the wise , meridian blaze of prudence , full-moon of discretion , and chief of many counsellors ! How infinitely is thy puddle-headed , rattle-headed , wrong-headed , round-headed slave indebted to thy supereminent goodness , that from the luminous path of thy own right-lined rectitude , thou lookest benignly down on an erring wretch , of whom the zig-zag wanderings defy all the powers of calculation , from the simple copulation of units , up to the hidden mysteries of fluxions ! May one feeble ray of that light of wisdom which darts from thy sensorium , straight as the arrow of heaven , and bright as the meteor of inspiration , may it be my portion , so that I may be less unworthy of the face and favour of that father of proverbs and master of maxims , that antipode of folly , and magnet among the sages , the wise and witty Willie Nicol ! Amen ! Amen ! Yea , so be it !</p>
   <p>For me ! I am a beast , a reptile , and know nothing ! From the cave of my ignorance , amid the fogs of my dulness , and pestilential fumes of my political heresies , I look up to thee , as doth a toad through the iron-barred lucerne of a pestiferous dungeon , to the cloudless glory of a summer sun ! Sorely sighing in bitterness of soul , I say , when shall my name be the quotation of the wise , and my countenance be the delight of the godly , like the illustrious lord of Laggan 's many hills ? As for him , his works are perfect : never did the pen of calumny blur the fair page of his reputation , nor the bolt of hatred fly at his dwelling .</p>
   <p>Thou mirror of purity , when shall the elfine lamp of my glimmerous understanding , purged from sensual appetites and gross desires , shine like the constellation of thy intellectual powers !— As for thee , thy thoughts are pure , and thy lips are holy . Never did the unhallowed breath of the powers of darkness , and the pleasures of darkness , pollute the sacred flame of thy sky-descended and heaven-bound desires : never did the vapours of impurity stain the unclouded serene of thy cerulean imagination . O that like thine were the tenor of my life , like thine the tenor of my conversation ! then should no friend fear for my strength , no enemy rejoice in my weakness ! Then should I lie down and rise up , and none to make me afraid .— May thy pity and thy prayer be exercised for , O thou lamp of wisdom and mirror of morality ! thy devoted slave .</p>

    <head>I believe among all our Scots Literati you have not met with Professor Dugald Stewart , who fills the moral philosophy chair in the University of Edinburgh . To say that he is a man of the first parts , and what is more , a man of the first worth , to a gentleman of your general acquaintance , and who so much enjoys the luxury of unencumbered freedom and undisturbed privacy , is not perhaps recommendation enough :— but when I inform you that Mr. Stewart 's principal characteristic is your favourite feature ; that sterling independence of mind , which , though every man 's right , so few men have the courage to claim , and fewer still , the magnanimity to support :— when I tell you that , unseduced by splendour , and undisgusted by wretchedness , he appreciates the merits of the various actors in the great drama of life , merely as they perform their parts — in short , he is a man after your own heart , and I comply with his earnest request in letting you know that he wishes above all things to meet with you . His house , Catrine , is within less than a mile of Sorn Castle , which you proposed visiting ; or if you could transmit him the enclosed , he would with the greatest pleasure meet you anywhere in the neighbourhood .

     <l n="2">Among the many witch stories I have heard , relating to Alloway kirk , I</l>
     <l n="3">distinctly remember only two or three .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Upon a stormy night , amid whistling squalls of wind , and bitter blasts of hail ; in short , on such a night as the devil would choose to take the air in ; a farmer or farmer 's servant was plodding and plashing homeward with his plough-irons on his shoulder , having been getting some repairs on them at a neighbouring smithy . His way lay by the kirk of Alloway , and being rather on the anxious look-out in approaching a place so well known to be a favourite haunt of the devil and the devil 's friends and emissaries , he was struck aghast by discovering through the horrors of the storm and stormy night , a light , which on his nearer approach plainly showed itself to proceed from the haunted edifice . Whether he had been fortified from above , on his devout supplication , as is customary with people when they suspect the immediate presence of Satan ; or whether , according to another custom , he had got courageously drunk at the smithy , I will not pretend to determine ; but so it was that he ventured to go up to , nay , into , the very kirk . As luck would have it , his temerity came off unpunished .</p>
   <p>The members of the infernal junto were all out on some midnight business or other , and he saw nothing but a kind of kettle or caldron , depending from the roof , over the fire , simmering some heads of unchristened children , limbs of executed malefactors , &amp; c ., for the business of the night .— It was in for a penny in for a pound , with the honest ploughman : so without ceremony he unhooked the caldron from off the fire , and pouring out the damnable ingredients , inverted it on his head , and carried it fairly home , where it remained long in the family , a living evidence of the truth of the story .</p>
   <p>Another story , which I can prove to be equally authentic , was as follows :</p>
   <p>On a market day in the town of Ayr , a farmer from Carrick , and consequently whose way lay by the very gate of Alloway kirk-yard , in order to cross the river Doon at the old bridge , which is about two or three hundred yards farther on than the said gate , had been detained by his business , till by the time he reached Alloway it was the wizard hour , between night and morning .</p>
   <p>Though he was terrified with a blaze streaming from the kirk , yet it is a well-known fact that to turn back on these occasions is running by far the greatest risk of mischief , he prudently advanced on his road . When he had reached the gate of the kirk-yard , he was surprised and entertained , through the ribs and arches of an old gothic window , which still faces the highway , to see a dance of witches merrily footing it round their old sooty blackguard master , who was keeping them all alive with the power of his bag-pipe . The farmer stopping his horse to observe them a little , could plainly descry the faces of many old women of his acquaintance and neighbourhood . How the gentleman was dressed tradition does not say ; but that the ladies were all in their smocks : and one of them happening unluckily to have a smock which was considerably too short to answer all the purpose of that piece of dress , our farmer was so tickled , that he involuntarily burst out , with a loud laugh , “ Weel luppen , Maggy wi ’ the short sark ! ” and recollecting himself , instantly spurred his horse to the top of his speed . I need not mention the universally known fact , that no diabolical power can pursue you beyond the middle of a running stream . Lucky it was for the poor farmer that the river Doon was so near , for notwithstanding the speed of his horse , which was a good one , against he reached the middle of the arch of the bridge , and consequently the middle of the stream , the pursuing , vengeful hags , were so close at big heels , that one of them actually sprung to seize him ; but it was too late , nothing was on her side of the stream , but the horse 's tail , which immediately gave way at her infernal grip , as if blasted by a stroke of lightning ; but the farmer was beyond her reach . However , the unsightly , tailless condition of the vigorous steed was , to the last hour of the noble creature 's life , an awful warning to the Carrick farmers , not to stay too late in Ayr markets .</p>
   <p>The last relation I shall give , though equally true , is not so well identified as the two former , with regard to the scene ; but as the best authorities give it for Alloway , I shall relate it .</p>
   <p>On a summer 's evening , about the time that nature puts on her sables to mourn the expiry of the cheerful day , a shepherd boy , belonging to a farmer in the immediate neighbourhood of Alloway kirk , had just folded his charge , and was returning home . As he passed the kirk , in the adjoining field , he fell in with a crew of men and women , who were busy pulling stems of the plant Ragwort . He observed that as each person pulled a Ragwort , he or she got astride of it , and called out , “ Up horsie ! ” on which the Ragwort flew off , like Pegasus , through the air with its rider . The foolish boy likewise pulled his Ragwort , and cried with the rest , “ Up horsie ! ” and , strange to tell , away he flew with the company . The first stage at which the cavalcade stopt , was a merchant 's wine-cellar in Bordeaux , where , without saying by your leave , they quaffed away at the best the cellar could afford , until the morning , foe to the imps and works of darkness , threatened to throw light on the matter , and frightened them from their carousals .</p>
   <p>The poor shepherd lad , being equally a stranger to the scene and the liquor , heedlessly got himself drunk ; and when the rest took horse , he fell asleep , and was found so next day by some of the people belonging to the merchant . Somebody that understood Scotch , asking him what he was , he said such-a-one 's herd in Alloway , and by some means or other getting home again , he lived long to tell the world the wondrous tale .</p>

   <p>Mr. Burns begs leave to present his most respectful compliments to Mr . Clarke .— Mr . B. some time ago did himself the honour of writing to Mr. C. respecting coming out to the country , to give a little musical instruction in a highly respectable family , where Mr. C. may have his own terms , and may be as happy as indolence , the devil , and the gout will permit him . Mr. B. knows well how Mr. C. is engaged with another family ; but cannot Mr. C. find two or three weeks to spare to each of them ? Mr. B. is deeply impressed with , and awfully conscious of , the high importance of Mr. C .' s time , whether in the winged moments of symphonious exhibition , at the keys of harmony , while listening seraphs cease their own less delightful strains ; or in the drowsy arms of slumb'rous repose , in the arms of his dearly beloved elbowchair , where the frowsy , but potent power of indolence , circumfuses her vapours round , and sheds her dews on the head of her darling son . But half a line conveying half a meaning from Mr. C. would make Mr. B. the happiest of mortals .</p>

   <p>Do you think it possible , my dear and honoured friend , that I could be so lost to gratitude for many favours ; to esteem for much worth , and to the honest , kind , pleasurably tie of , now old acquaintance , and I hope and am sure of progressive , increasing friendship — as for a single day , not to think of you — to ask the Fates what they are doing and about to do with my much-loved friend and her wide-scattered connexions , and to beg of them to be as kind to you and yours as they possibly can ?</p>
   <p>Apropos ! ( though how it is apropos , I have not leisure to explain ,) do you not know that I am almost in love with an acquaintance of yours ?— Almost ! said I — I am in love , souse ! over head and ears , deep as the most unfathomable abyss of the boundless ocean ; but the word Love , owing to the intermingledoms of the good and the bad , the pure and the impure , in this world , being rather an equivocal term for expressing one 's sentiments and sensations , I must do justice to the sacred purity of my attachment . Know , then , that the heart-struck awe ; the distant humble approach ; the delight we should have in gazing upon and listening to a messenger of heaven , appearing in all the unspotted purity of his celestial home , among the coarse , polluted , far inferior sons of men , to deliver to them tidings that make their hearts swim in joy , and their imaginations soar in transport — such , so delighting and so pure , were the emotions of my soul on meeting the other day with Miss Lesley Baillie , your neighbour , at M ——. Mr. B. with his two daughters , accompanied by Mr. H. of G. passing through Dumfries a few days ago , on their way to England , did me the honour of calling on me ; on which I took my horse ( though God knows I could ill spare the time ) , and accompanied them fourteen or fifteen miles , and dined and spent the day with them . ‘ Twas about nine , I think , when I left them , and riding home , I composed the following ballad , of which you will probably think you have a dear bargain , as it will cost you another groat of postage . You must know that there is an old ballad beginning with —</p>

   <p>So much for ballads . I regret that you are gone to the east country , as I am to be in Ayrshire in about a fortnight . This world of ours , notwithstanding it has many good things in it , yet it has ever had this curse , that two or three people , who would be the happier the oftener they met together , are , almost without exception , always so placed as never to meet but once or twice a-year , which , considering the few years of a man 's life , is a very great “ evil under the sun , ” which I do not recollect that Solomon has mentioned in his catalogue of the miseries of man . I hope and believe that there is a state of existence beyond the grave , where the worthy of this life will renew their former intimacies , with this endearing addition , that , “ we meet to part no more ! ”</p>
   <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . “ Tell us , ye dead , Will none of you in pity disclose the secret , What ‘ tis you are , and we must shortly be ? ”</p>
   <p>BLAIR</p>
   <p>A thousand times have I made this apostrophe to the departed sons of men , but not one of them has ever thought fit to answer the question . “ O that some courteous ghost would blab it out ! ” but it cannot be ; you and I , my friend , must make the experiment by ourselves and for ourselves . However , I am so convinced that an unshaken faith in the doctrines of religion is not only necessary , by making us better men , but also by making us happier men , that I should take every care that your little godson , and every little creature that shall call me father , shall be taught them .</p>

   <p>No ! I will not attempt an apology .— Amid all my hurry of business , grinding the faces of the publican and the sinner on the merciless wheels of the Excise ; making ballads , and then drinking , and singing them ! and , over and above all , the correcting the press-work of two different publications ; still , still I might have stolen five minutes to dedicate to one of the first of my friends and fellow-creatures . I might have done as I do at present , snatched an hour near “ witching time of night , ” and scrawled a page or two . I might have congratulated my friend on his marriage ; or I might have thanked the Caledonian archers for the honour they have done me ( though , to do myself justice , I intended to have done both in rhyme , else I had done both long ere now ) . Well , then , here 's to your good health ! for you must know , I have set a nipperkin of toddy by me , just by way of spell , to keep away the meikle horned deil , or any of his subaltern imps who may be on their nightly rounds .</p>
   <p>But what shall I write to you ?— “ The voice said cry , ” and I said , “ what shall I cry ? ” — O , thou spirit ! whatever thou art , or wherever thou makest thyself visible ! be thou a bogle by the eerie side of an auld thorn , in the dreary glen through which the herd-callan maun bicker in his gloamin route frae the faulde !— Be thou a brownie , set , at dead of night , to thy task by the blazing ingle , or in the solitary barn , where the repercussions of thy iron flail half affright thyself as thou performest the work of twenty of the sons of men , ere the cock-crowing summon thee to thy ample cog of substantial brose — Be thou a kelpie , haunting the ford or ferry , in the starless night , mixing thy laughing yell with the howling of the storm and the roaring of the flood , as thou viewest the perils and miseries of man on the foundering horse , or in the tumbling boat !— or , lastly , be thou a ghost , paying thy nocturnal visits to the hoary ruins of decayed grandeur ; or performing thy mystic rites in the shadow of the time-worn church , while the moon looks , without a cloud , on the silent ghastly dwellings of the dead around thee ! or taking thy stand by the bedside of the villain , or the murderer , pourtraying on his dreaming fancy , pictures , dreadful as the horrors of unveiled hell , and terrible as the wrath of incensed Deity !— Come , thou spirit , but not in these horrid forms ; come with the milder , gentle , easy inspirations , which thou breathest round the wig of a prating advocate , or the tête of a tea-sipping gossip , while their tongues run at the light-horse gallop of clishmaclaver for ever and ever — come and assist a poor devil who is quite jaded in the attempt to share half an idea among half a hundred words ; to fill up four quarto pages , while he has not got one single sentence of recollection , information , or remark worth putting pen to paper for .</p>
   <p>I feel , I feel the presence of supernatural assistance ! circled in the embrace of my elbowchair , my breast labours , like the bloated Sybil on her three-footed stool , and like her , too , labours with Nonsense .— Nonsense , suspicious name ! Tutor , friend , and finger-post in the mystic mazes of law ; the cadaverous paths of physic ; and particularly in the sightless soarings of SCHOOL DIVINITY , who , leaving Common Sense confounded at his strength of pinion , Reason , delirious with eyeing his giddy flight ; and Truth creeping back into the bottom of her well , cursing the hour that ever she offered her scorned alliance to the wizard power of Theologic Vision — raves abroad on all the winds . “ On earth Discord ! a gloomy Heaven above , opening her jealous gates to the nineteenth thousandth part of the tithe of mankind ; and below , an inescapable and inexorable hell , expanding its leviathan jaws for the vast residue of mortals !!! ” — O doctrine ! comfortable and healing to the weary , wounded soul of man ! Ye sons and daughters of affliction , ye pauvres miserables , to whom day brings no pleasure , and night yields no rest , be comforted ! “ ‘ Tis but one to nineteen hundred thousand that your situation will mend in this world ; ” so , alas , the experience of the poor and the needy too often affirms ; and ‘ tis nineteen hundred thousand sand to one , by the dogmas of * * * * * * * * that you will be damned eternally in the world to come !</p>
   <p>But of all nonsense , religious nonsense is the most nonsensical ; so enough , and more than enough of it . Only , by the by , will you or can you tell me , my dear Cunningham , why a sectarian turn of mind has always a tendency to narrow and illiberalize the heart ? They are orderly ; they may be just ; nay , I have known them merciful : but still your children of sanctity move among their fellow-creatures with a nostril-snuffing putrescence , and a foot-spurning filth , in short , with a conceited dignity that your titled * * * * * * * * or any other of your Scottish lordlings of seven centuries standing , display when they accidentally mix among the many-aproned sons of mechanical life . I remember , in my plough-boy days , I could not conceive it possible that a noble lord could be a fool , or a godly man could be a knave — How ignorant are plough-boys !— Nay , I have since discovered that a godly woman may be a *****!— But hold — Here 's t'ye again — this rum is generous Antigua , so a very unfit menstruum for scandal .</p>
   <p>Apropos , how do you like , I mean really like , the married life ? Ah , my friend ! matrimony is quite a different thing from what your love-sick youths and sighing girls take it to be ! But marriage , we are told , is appointed by God , and I shall never quarrel with any of his institutions . I am a husband of older standing than you , and shall give you my ideas of the conjugal state , ( en passant ; you know I am no Latinist , is not conjugal derived from jugum , a yoke ? ) Well , then , the scale of good wifeship I divide into ten parts :— good-nature , four ; good sense , two ; wit , one ; personal charms , viz . a sweet face , eloquent eyes , fine limbs , graceful carriage ( I would add a fine waist too , but that is so soon spoilt you know ) , all these , one ; as for the other qualities belonging to , or attending on , a wife , such as fortune , connexions , education ( I mean education extraordinary ) family , blood , &amp; c ., divide the two remaining degrees among them as you please ; only , remember that all these minor properties must be expressed by fractions , for there is not any one of them , in the aforesaid scale , entitled to the dignity of an integer .</p>
   <p>As for the rest of my fancies and reveries — how I lately met with Miss Lesley Baillie , the most beautiful , elegant woman in the world — how I accompanied her and her father 's family fifteen miles on their journey , out of pure devotion , to admire the loveliness of the works of God , in such an unequalled display of them — how , in galloping home at night , I made a ballad on her , of which these two stanzas make a part —</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have just this moment got your letter . As the request you make to me will positively add to my enjoyments in complying with it , I shall enter into your undertaking with all the small portion of abilities I have , strained to their utmost exertion by the impulse of enthusiasm . Only , do n't hurry me — “ Deil tak the hindmost ” is by no means the cri de guerre of my muse . Will you , as I am inferior to none of you in enthusiastic attachment to the poetry and music of old Caledonia , and , since you request it , have cheerfully promised my mite of assistance — will you let me have a list of your airs with the first line of the printed verses you intend for them , that I may have an opportunity of suggesting any alteration that may occur to me ? You know ‘ tis in the way of my trade ; still leaving you , gentlemen , the undoubted right of publishers to approve or reject , at your pleasure , for your own publication . Apropos , if you are for English verses , there is , on my part , an end of the matter . Whether in the simplicity of the Ballad , or the pathos of the song , I can only hope to please myself in being allowed at least a sprinkling of our native tongue . English verses , particularly the works of Scotsmen , that have merit , are certainly very eligible . “ Tweedside ’ ” “ Ah ! the poor shepherd 's mournful fate ! ” “ Ah ! Chloris , could I now but sit , ” &amp; c ., you cannot mend ;<span corresp="#note199" type="note_anchor">[ 199 ]</span>but such insipid stuff as “ To Fanny fair could I impart , ” &amp; c ., usually set to “ The Mill , Mill , O ! ” is a disgrace to the collections in which it has already appeared , and would doubly disgrace a collection that will have the very superior merit of yours . But more of this in the further prosecution of the business , if I am called on for my strictures and amendments — I say amendments , for I will not alter except where I myself , at least , think that I amend .</p>
   <p>As to any remuneration , you may think my songs either above or below price ; for they should absolutely be the one or the other . In the honest enthusiasm with which I embark in your undertaking , to talk of money , wages , fee , hire , &amp; c ., would be downright prostitution of soul ! a proof of each of the song that I compose or amend , I shall receive as a favour . In the rustic phrase of the season , “ Gude speed the wark ! ”</p>
   <p>I am , Sir ,</p>
   <p>Your very humble servant ,</p>

    <head>TO MRS. DUNLOP .</head>
    <note>One of the daughters of Mrs. Dunlop was married to M. Henri , a French gentleman , who died in 1790 , at Loudon Castle , in Ayrshire . The widow went with her orphan son to France , and lived for awhile amid the dangers of the revolution .</note>
     <l n="1">Dumfries , 24th September , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have this moment , my dear Madam , yours of the twenty-third . All your other kind reproaches , your news , &amp; c ., are out of my head when I read and think on Mrs. H —— ‘ s situation . Good God ! a heart-wounded helpless young woman — in a strange , foreign land , and that land convulsed with every horror that can harrow the human feelings — sick — looking , longing for a comforter , but finding none — a mother 's feelings , too :— but it is too much : he who wounded ( he only can ) may He heal !</p>
   <p>I wish the farmer great joy of his new acquisition to his family . * * * * * I cannot say that I give him joy of his life as a farmer . ‘ Tis , as a farmer paying a dear , unconscionable rent , a cursed life ! As to a laird farming his own property ; sowing his own corn in hope ; and reaping it , in spite of brittle weather , in gladness ; knowing that none can say unto him , ‘ what dost thou ? ’ — fattening his herds ; shearing his flocks ; rejoicing at Christmas ; and begetting sons and daughters , until he be the venerated , gray-haired leader of a little tribe — ‘ tis a heavenly life ! but devil take the life of reaping the fruits that another must eat .</p>
   <p>Well , your kind wishes will be gratified , as to seeing me when I make my Ayrshire visit . I cannot leave Mrs. B ——, until her nine months ’ race is run , which may perhaps be in three or four weeks . She , too , seems determined to make me the patriarchal leader of a band . However , if Heaven will be so obliging as to let me have them in the proportion of three boys to one girl , I shall be so much the more pleased . I hope , if I am spared with them , to show a set of boys that will do honour to my cares and name ; but I am not equal to the task of rearing girls . Besides , I am too poor ; a girl should always have a fortune . Apropos , your little godson is thriving charmingly , but is a very devil . He , though two years younger , has completely mastered his brother . Robert is indeed the mildest , gentlest creature I ever saw . He has a most surprising memory , and is quite the pride of his schoolmaster .</p>
   <p>You know how readily we get into prattle upon a subject dear to our heart : you can excuse it . God bless you and yours !</p>

   <note>This letter has no date : it is supposed to have been written on the death of her daughter , Mrs. Henri , whose orphan son , deprived of the protection of all his relations , was preserved by the affectionate kindness of Mademoiselle Susette , one of the family domestics , and after the Revolution obtained the estate of his blood and name .</note>
   <p>I had been from home , and did not receive your letter until my return the other day . What shall I say to comfort you , my much-valued , much-afflicted friend ! I can but grieve with you ; consolation I have none to offer , except that which religion holds out to the children of affliction — children of affliction !— how just the expression ! and like every other family they have matters among them which they hear , see , and feel in a serious , all-important manner , of which the world has not , nor cares to have , any idea . The world looks indifferently on , makes the passing remark , and proceeds to the next novel occurrence .</p>
   <p>Alas , Madam ! who would wish for many years ? What is it but to drag existence until our joys gradually expire , and leave us in a night of misery : like the gloom which blots out the stars one by one , from the face of night , and leaves us , without a ray of comfort , in the howling waste !</p>
   <p>I am interrupted , and must leave off . You shall soon hear from me again .</p>

    <head>MY DEAR SIR ,</head>
    <head>Let me tell you , that you are too fastidious in your ideas of songs and ballads . I own that your criticisms are just ; the songs you specify in your list have , all but one , the faults you remark in them ; but who shall mend the matter ? Who shall rise up and say , “ Go to !

   <p>Your observation as to the aptitude of Dr. Percy 's ballad to the air , “ Nannie , O ! ” is just . It is , besides , perhaps , the most beautiful ballad in the English language . But let me remark to you , that in the sentiment and style of our Scottish airs , there is a pastoral simplicity , a something that one may call the Doric style and dialect of vocal music , to which a dash of our native tongue and manners is particularly , nay peculiarly , apposite . For this reason , and upon my honour , for this reason alone , I am of opinion ( but , as I told you before , my opinion is yours , freely yours , to approve or reject , as you please ) that my ballad of “ Nannie , O ! ” might perhaps do for one set of verses to the tune . Now do n't let it enter into your head , that you are under any necessity of taking my verses . I have long ago made up my mind as to my own reputation in the business of authorship , and have nothing to be pleased or offended at , in your adoption or rejection of my verses . Though you should reject one half of what I give you , I shall be pleased with your adopting the other half , and shall continue to serve you with the same assiduity .</p>
   <p>In the printed copy of my “ Nannie , O ! ” the name of the river is horribly prosaic .<span corresp="#note201" type="note_anchor">[ 201 ]</span>I will alter it :</p>
   <p>Behind yon hills where Lugar flows .</p>
   <p>Girvan is the name of the river that suits the idea of the stanza best , but Lugar is the most agreeable modulation of syllables .</p>
   <p>I will soon give you a great many more remarks on this business ; but I have just now an opportunity of conveying you this scrawl , free of postage , an expense that it is ill able to pay : so , with my best compliments to honest Allan , Gude be wi ’ ye , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Friday Night .</p>
   <p>Saturday Morning .</p>
   <p>As I find I have still an hour to spare this morning before my conveyance goes away , I will give you “ Nannie , O ! ” at length .</p>
   <p>Your remarks on “ Ewe-bughts , Marion , ” are just ; still it has obtained a place among our more classical Scottish songs ; and what with many beauties in its composition , and more prejudices in its favour , you will not find it easy to supplant it .</p>
   <p>In my very early years , when I was thinking of going to the West Indies , I took the following farewell of a dear girl . It is quite trifling , and has nothing of the merits of “ Ewe-bughts ; ” but it will fill up this page . You must know that all my earlier love-songs were the breathings of ardent passion , and though it might have been easy in aftertimes to have given them a polish , yet that polish , to me , whose they were , and who perhaps alone cared for them , would have defaced the legend of my heart , which was so faithfully inscribed on them . Their uncouth simplicity was , as they say of wines , their race .</p>
   <p>Will ye go to the Indies , my Mary ? &amp; c.<span corresp="#note202" type="note_anchor">[ 202 ]</span></p>
   <p>“ Gala Water ” and “ Auld Rob Morris ” I think , will most probably be the next subject of my musings . However , even on my verses , speak out your criticisms with equal frankness . My wish is not to stand aloof , the uncomplying bigot of opiniâtreté , but cordially to join issue with you in the furtherance of the work .</p>

   <p>If you mean , my dear Sir , that all the songs in your collection shall be poetry of the first merit , I am afraid you will find more difficulty in the undertaking than you are aware of . There is a peculiar rhythmus in many of our airs , and a necessity of adapting syllables to the emphasis , or what I would call the feature-notes of the tune , that cramp the poet , and lay him under almost insuperable difficulties . For instance , in the air , “ My wife 's a wanton wee thing , ” if a few lines smooth and pretty can be adapted to it , it is all you can expect . The following were made extempore to it ; and though on further study I might give you something more profound , yet it might not suit the light-horse gallop of the air so well as this random clink :—</p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I agree with you that the song , “ Katherine Ogie , ” is very poor stuff , and unworthy , altogether unworthy of so beautiful an air . I tried to mend it ; but the awkward sound , Ogie , recurring so often in the rhyme , spoils every attempt at introducing sentiment into the piece . The foregoing song<span corresp="#note205" type="note_anchor">[ 205 ]</span>pleases myself ; I think it as in my happiest manner : you will see at first glance that it suits the air . The subject of the song is one of the most interesting passages of my youthful days , and I own that I should be much flattered to see the verses set to an air which would ensure celebrity . Perhaps , after all , ‘ tis the still glowing prejudice of my heart that throws a borrowed lustre over the merits of the composition .</p>
   <p>I have partly taken your idea of “ Auld Rob Morris . ” I have adopted the two first verses , and am going on with the song on a new plan , which promises pretty well . I take up one or another , just as the bee of the moment buzzes in my bonnet-lug ; and do you , sans ceremonie , make what use you choose of the productions .</p>

   <p>Your alterations of my “ Nannie , O ! ” are perfectly right . So are those of “ My wife 's a winsome wee thing . ” Your alteration of the second stanza is a positive improvement . Now , my dear Sir , with the freedom which characterizes our correspondence , I must not , cannot alter “ Bonnie Lesley . ” You are right ; the word “ Alexander ” makes the line a little uncouth , but I think the thought is pretty . Of Alexander , beyond all other heroes , it may be said , in the sublime language of Scripture , that “ he went forth conquering and to conquer . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">For nature made her what she is ,</l>
     <l n="2">And never made anither . ( Such a person as she is . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>This is , in my opinion , more poetical than “ Ne'er made sic anither . ” However , it is immaterial : make it either way . “ Caledonie , ” I agree with you , is not so good a word as could be wished , though it is sanctioned in three or four instances by Allan Ramsay ; but I cannot help it . In short , that species of stanza is the most difficult that I have ever tried .</p>

Acquit them or condemn them , as seemeth good in your sight . “ Duncan Gray ” is that kind of light-horse gallop of an air , which precludes sentiment . The ludicrous is its ruling feature .</p>

   <p>I shall be in Ayrshire , I think , next week ; and , if at all possible , I shall certainly , my much-esteemed friend , have the pleasure of visiting at Dunlop-house .</p>
   <p>Alas , Madam ! how seldom do we meet in this world , that we have reason to congratulate ourselves on accessions of happiness ! I have not passed half the ordinary term of an old man 's life , and yet I scarcely look over the obituary of a newspaper , that I do not see some names that I have known , and which I , and other acquaintances , little thought to meet with there so soon . Every other instance of the mortality of our kind , makes us cast an anxious look into the dreadful abyss of uncertainty , and shudder with apprehension for our own fate . But of how different an importance are the lives of different individuals ? Nay , of what importance is one period of the same life , more than another ? A few years ago , I could have laid down in the dust , “ careless of the voice of the morning ; ” and now not a few , and these most helpless individuals , would , on losing me and my exertions , lose both their “ staff and shield . ” By the way , these helpless ones have lately got an addition ; Mrs. B —— having given me a fine girl since I wrote you . There is a charming passage in Thomson 's “ Edward and Eleonora : ”</p>
   <p>“ The valiant in himself , what can he suffer ? Or what need he regard his single woes ? ” &amp; c .</p>
   <p>As I am got in the way of quotations , I shall give you another from the same piece , peculiarly , alas ! too peculiarly apposite , my dear Madam , to your present frame of mind :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Who so unworthy but may proudly deck him</l>
     <l n="2">With his fair-weather virtue , that exults</l>
     <l n="3">Glad o'er the summer main ! the tempest comes ,</l>
     <l n="4">The rough winds rage aloud ; when from the helm ,</l>
     <l n="5">This virtue shrinks , and in a corner lies</l>
     <l n="6">Lamenting — Heavens ! if privileged from trial ,</l>
     <l n="7">How cheap a thing were virtue ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I do not remember to have heard you mention Thomson 's dramas . I pick up favourite quotations , and store them in my mind as ready armour , offensive or defensive , amid the struggle of this turbulent existence . Of these is one , a very favourite one , from his “ Alfred : ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Attach thee firmly to the virtuous deeds</l>
     <l n="2">And offices of life ; to life itself ,</l>
     <l n="3">With all its vain and transient joys , sit loose . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Probably I have quoted some of these to you formerly , as indeed when I write from the heart , I am apt to be guilty of such repetitions . The compass of the heart , in the musical style of expression , is much more bounded than that of the imagination ; so the notes of the former are extremely apt to run into one another ; but in return for the paucity of its compass , its few notes are much more sweet . I must still give you another quotation , which I am almost sure I have given you before , but I cannot resist the temptation . The subject is religion — speaking of its importance to mankind , the author says ,</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Tis this , my friend , that streaks our morning bright . ”</p>
   <p>I see you are in for double postage , so I shall e'en scribble out t'other sheet . We , in this country here , have many alarms of the reforming , or rather the republican spirit , of your part of the kingdom . Indeed we are a good deal in commotion ourselves . For me , I am a placeman , you know ; a very humble one indeed , Heaven knows , but still so much as to gag me . What my private sentiments are , you will find out without an interpreter .</p>
   <p>I have taken up the subject , and the other day , for a pretty actress 's benefit night , I wrote an address , which I will give on the other page , called “ The rights of woman : ”</p>
   <p>“ While Europe 's eye is fixed on mighty things . ”</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>I have been surprised , confounded , and distracted by Mr. Mitchell , the collector , telling me that he has received an order from your Board to inquire into my political conduct , and blaming me as a person disaffected to government .</p>
   <p>Sir , you are a husband — and a father .— You know what you would feel , to see the much-loved wife of your bosom , and your helpless , prattling little ones , turned adrift into the world , degraded and disgraced from a situation in which they had been respectable and respected , and left almost without the necessary support of a miserable existence . Alas , Sir ! must I think that such , soon , will be my lot ! and from the d — mned , dark insinuations of hellish , groundless envy too ! I believe , Sir , I may aver it , and in the sight of Omniscience , that I would not tell a deliberate falsehood , no , not though even worse horrors , if worse can be , than those I have mentioned , hung over my head ; and I say , that the allegation , whatever villain has made it , is a lie ! To the British constitution on Revolution principles , next after my God , I am most devoutly attached ; you , Sir , have been much and generously my friend .— Heaven knows how warmly I have felt the obligation , and how gratefully I have thanked you .— Fortune , Sir , has made you powerful , and me impotent ; has given you patronage , and me dependence .— I would not for my single self , call on your humanity ; were such my insular , unconnected situation , I would despise the tear that now swells in my eye — I could brave misfortune , I could face ruin ; for at the worst , “ Death 's thousand doors stand open ; ” but , good God ! the tender concerns that I have mentioned , the claims and ties that I see at this moment , and feel around me , how they unnerve courage , and wither resolution ! To your patronage , as a man of some genius , you have allowed me a claim ; and your esteem , as an honest man , I know is my due : to these , Sir , permit me to appeal ; by these may I adjure you to save me from that misery which threatens to overwhelm me , and which , with my latest breath I will say it , I have not deserved .</p>

    <head>DEAR MADAM ,</head>
    <head>A hurry of business , thrown in heaps by my absence , has until now prevented my returning my grateful acknowledgments to the good family of Dunlop , and you in particular , for that hospitable kindness which rendered the four days I spent under that genial roof , four of the pleasantest I ever enjoyed .— Alas , my dearest friend ! how few and fleeting are those things we call pleasures ! on my road to Ayrshire , I spent a night with a friend whom I much valued ; a man whose days promised to be many ; and on Saturday last we laid him in the dust !</head>

   <p>I have just received yours of the 30th , and feel much for your situation . However , I heartily rejoice in your prospect of recovery from that vile jaundice . As to myself , I am better , though not quite free of my complaint .— You must not think , as you seem to insinuate , that in my way of life I want exercise . Of that I have enough ; but occasional hard drinking is the devil to me . Against this I have again and again bent my resolution , and have greatly succeeded . Taverns I have totally abandoned : it is the private parties in the family way , among the hard-drinking gentlemen of this country , that do me the mischief — but even this I have more than half given over .</p>
   <p>Mr. Corbet can be of little service to me at present ; at least I should be shy of applying . I cannot possibly be settled as a supervisor , for several years . I must wait the rotation of the list , and there are twenty names before mine . I might indeed get a job of officiating , where a settled supervisor was ill , or aged ; but that hauls me from my family , as I could not remove them on such an uncertainty . Besides , some envious , malicious devil , has raised a little demur on my political principles , and I wish to let that matter settle before I offer myself too much in the eye of my supervisors . I have set , henceforth , a seal on my lips , as to these unlucky politics ; but to you I must breathe my sentiments . In this , as in everything else , I shall show the undisguised emotions of my soul . War I deprecate : misery and ruin to thousands are in the blast that announces the destructive demon .</p>

    <note>Thomson explained more fully than at first the plan of his publication , and stated that Dr. Beattie had promised an essay on Scottish music , by way of an introduction to the work .</note>
     <l n="1">26th January , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I approve greatly , my dear Sir , of your plans . Dr. Beattie 's essay will , of itself , be a treasure . On my part I mean to draw up an appendix to the Doctor 's essay , containing my stock of anecdotes , &amp; c ., of our Scots songs . All the late Mr. Tytler 's anecdotes I have by me , taken down in the course of my acquaintance with him , from his own mouth . I am such an enthusiast , that in the course of my several peregrinations through Scotland , I made a pilgrimage to the individual spot from which every song took its rise , “ Lochaber ” and the “ Braes of Ballenden ” excepted . So far as the locality , either from the title of the air , or the tenor of the song , could be ascertained , I have paid my devotions at the particular shrine of every Scots muse .</p>
   <p>I do not doubt but you might make a very valuable collection of Jacobite songs ; but would it give no offence ? In the meantime , do not you think that some of them , particularly “ The sow 's tail to Geordie , ” as an air , with other words , might be well worth a place in your collection of lively songs ?</p>
   <p>If it were possible to procure songs of merit , it would be proper to have one set of Scots words to every air , and that the set of words to which the notes ought to be set . There is a navïeté , a pastoral simplicity , in a slight intermixture of Scots words and phraseology , which is more in unison ( at least to my taste , and , I will add , to every genuine Caledonian taste ) with the simple pathos , or rustic sprightliness of our native music , than any English verses whatever .</p>
   <p>The very name of Peter Pindar is an acquisition to your work . His “ Gregory ” is beautiful . I have tried to give you a set of stanzas in Scots , on the same subject , which are at your service . Not that I intend to enter the lists with Peter — that would be presumption indeed . My song , though much inferior in poetic merit , has , I think , more of the ballad simplicity in it .</p>
   <note>Here follows “ Lord Gregory . ” Song CLXXXVII .</note>
   <p>My most respectful compliments to the honourable gentleman who favoured me with a postscript in your last . He shall hear from me and receive his MSS . soon .</p>

   <p>Since I wrote to you the last lugubrious sheet , I have not had time to write you further . When I say that I had not time , that as usual means , that the three demons , indolence , business , and ennui , have so completely shared my hours among them , as not to leave me a five minutes ’ fragment to take up a pen in .</p>
   <p>Thank heaven , I feel my spirits buoying upwards with the renovating year . Now I shall in good earnest take up Thomson 's songs . I dare say he thinks I have used him unkindly , and I must own with too much appearance of truth . Apropos , do you know the much admired old Highland air called “ The Sutor 's Dochter ? ” It is a first-rate favourite of mine , and I have written what I reckon one of my best songs to it . I will send it to you as it was sung with great applause in some fashionable circles by Major Roberston , of Lude , who was here with his corps .</p>
   <p>There is one commission that I must trouble you with . I lately lost a valuable seal , a present from a departed friend which vexes me much .</p>
   <p>I have gotten one of your Highland pebbles , which I fancy would make a very decent one ; and I want to cut my armorial bearing on it ; will you be so obliging as inquire what will be the expense of such a business ? I do not know that my name is matriculated , as the heralds call it , at all ; but I have invented arms for myself , so you know I shall be chief of the name ; and , by courtesy of Scotland , will likewise be entitled to supporters . These , however , I do not intend having on my seal . I am a bit of a herald , and shall give you , secundum artem , my arms . On a field , azure , a holly-bush , seeded , proper , in base ; a shepherd 's pipe and crook , saltier-wise , also proper in chief . On a wreath of the colours , a wood lark perching on a sprig of bay-tree , proper , for crest . Two mottos ; round the top of the crest , Wood-notes wild : at the bottom of the shield , in the usual place , Better a wee bush than nae bield . By the shepherd 's pipe and crook I do not mean the nonsense of painters of Arcadia , but a stock and horn , and a club , such as you see at the head of Allan Ramsay , in Allan 's quarto edition of the Gentle Shepherd . By the bye , do you know Allan ? He must be a man of very great genius — Why is he not more known ?— Has he no patrons ? or do “ Poverty 's cold wind and crushing rain beat keen and heavy ” on him ! I once , and but once , got a glance of that noble edition of the noblest pastoral in the world ; and dear as it was , I mean dear as to my pocket , I would have bought it ; but I was told that it was printed and engraved for subscribers only . He is the only artist who has hit genuine pastoral costume . What , my dear Cunningham , is there in riches , that they narrow and harden the heart so ? I think , that were I as rich as the sun , I should be as generous as the day ; but as I have no reason to imagine my soul a nobler one than any other man 's , I must conclude that wealth imparts a bird-lime quality to the possessor , at which the man , in his native poverty , would have revolted . What has led me to this , is the idea , of such merit as Mr. Allan possesses , and such riches us a nabob or government contractor possesses , and why they do not form a mutual league . Let wealth shelter and cherish unprotected merit , and the gratitude and celebrity of that merit will richly repay it .</p>

   <p>Among many things for which I envy those hale , long-lived old fellows before the flood , is this in particular , that when they met with anybody after their own heart , they had a charming long prospect of many , many happy meetings with them in after-life .</p>
   <p>Now in this short , stormy , winter day of our fleeting existence , when you now and then , in the Chapter of Accidents , meet an individual whose acquaintance is a real acquisition , there are all the probabilities against you , that you shall never meet with that valued character more . On the other hand , brief as this miserable being is , it is none of the least of the miseries belonging to it , that if there is any miscreant whom you hate , or creature whom you despise , the ill-run of the chances shall be so against you , that in the overtakings , turnings , and jostlings of life , pop , at some unlucky corner , eternally comes the wretch upon you , and will not allow your indignation or contempt a moment 's repose . As I am a sturdy believer in the powers of darkness , I take these to be the doings of that old author of mischief , the devil . It is well-known that he has some kind of short-hand way of taking down our thoughts , and I make no doubt he is perfectly acquainted with my sentiments respecting Miss Benson : how much I admired her abilities and valued her worth , and how very fortunate I thought myself in her acquaintance . For this last reason , my dear Madam , I must entertain no hopes of the very great pleasure of meeting with you again .</p>
   <p>Miss Hamilton tells me that she is sending a packet to you , and I beg leave to send you the enclosed sonnet , though , to tell you the real truth , the sonnet is a mere pretence , that I may have the opportunity of declaring with how much respectful esteem I have the honour to be , &amp; c .</p>

What with my early attachment to ballads , your book , &amp; c ., ballad-making is now as completely my hobby-horse as ever fortification was Uncle Toby 's ; so I 'll e'en canter it away till I come to the limit of my race — God grant that I may take the right side of the winning post !— and then cheerfully looking back on the honest folks with whom I have been happy , I shall say or sing , “ Sae merry as we a ’ hae been ! ” and , raising my last looks to the whole human race , the last words of the voice of “ Coila "[ 208 ] shall be , “ Good night , and joy be wi ’ you a ’ ! ” So much for my last words : now for a few present remarks , as they have occurred at random , on looking over your list .</p>
   <p>The first lines of “ The last time I came o'er the moor , ” and several other lines in it , are beautiful ; but , in my opinion — pardon me , revered shade of Ramsay !— the song is unworthy of the divine air . I shall try to make or mend .</p>
   <p>“ For ever , Fortune , wilt thou prove ,"[ 209 ] is a charming song ; but “ Logan burn and Logan braes ” is sweetly susceptible of rural imagery ; I 'll try that likewise , and , if I succeed , the other song may class among the English ones . I remember the two last lines of a verse in some of the old songs of “ Logan Water ” ( for I know a good many different ones ) which I think pretty :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Now my dear lad maun faces his faes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Far , far frae me and Logan braes . "[ 210 ]</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ My Patie is a lover gay , ” is unequal . “ His mind is never muddy , ” is a</l>
     <l n="4">muddy expression indeed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="5">“ Then I 'll resign and marry Pate ,</l>
     <l n="6">And syne my cockernony — ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>This is surely far unworthy of Ramsay or your book . My song , “ Rigs of barley , ” to the same tune , does not altogether please me ; but if I can mend it , and thrash a few loose sentiments out of it , I will submit it to your consideration . “ The lass o ’ Patie 's mill ” is one of Ramsay 's best songs ; but there is one loose sentiment in it , which my much-valued friend Mr. Erskine will take into his critical consideration . In Sir John Sinclair 's statistical volumes , are two claims — one , I think from Aberdeenshire , and the other from Ayrshire — for the honour of this song . The following anecdote , which I had from the present Sir William Cunningham of Robertland , who had it of the late John , Earl of Loudon , I can , on such authorities , believe :</p>
   <p>Allan Ramsay was residing at Loudon-castle with the then Earl , father to Earl John ; and one forenoon , riding or walking , out together , his lordship and Allan passed a sweet romantic spot on Irvine water , still called “ Patie 's mill , ” where a bonnie lass was “ tedding hay , bare-headed on the green . ” My lord observed to Allan , that it would be a fine theme for a song . Ramsay took the hint , and , lingering behind , he composed the first sketch of it , which he produced at dinner .</p>
   <p>“ One day I heard Mary say ,"[ 211 ] is a fine song ; but , for consistency 's sake , alter the name “ Adonis . ” Were there ever such banns published , as a purpose of marriage between Adonis and Mary ! I agree with you that my song , “ There 's nought but care on every hand , ” is much superior to “ Poortith cauld . ” The original song , “ The mill , mill , O ! "[ 212 ] though excellent , is , on account of delicacy , inadmissible ; still I like the title , and think a Scottish song would suit the notes best ; and let your chosen song , which is very pretty , follow as an English set . “ The Banks of the Dee ” is , you know , literally “ Langolee , ” to slow time . The song is well enough , but has some false imagery in it : for instance ,</p>
   <p>“ And sweetly the nightingale sang from the tree . ”</p>
   <p>In the first place , the nightingale sings in a low bush , but never from a tree ; and in the second place , there never was a nightingale seen or heard on the banks of the Dee , or on the banks of any other river in Scotland . Exotic rural imagery is always comparatively flat .<span corresp="#note213" type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span>If I could hit on another stanza , equal to “ The small birds rejoice , ” &amp; c ., I do myself honestly avow , that I think it a superior song .<span corresp="#note214" type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span>“ John Anderson , my jo ” — the song to this tune in Johnson 's Museum , is my composition , and I think it not my worst :[ 215 ] if it suit you , take it , and welcome . Your collection of sentimental and pathetic songs , is , in my opinion , very complete ; but not so your comic ones . Where are “ Tullochgorum , ” “ Lumps o ’ puddin , ” “ Tibbie Fowler , ” and several others , which , in my humble judgment , are well worthy of preservation ? There is also one sentimental song of mine in the Museum , which never was known out of the immediate neighbourhood , until I got it taken down from a country girl 's singing . It is called “ Craigieburn wood , ” and , in the opinion of Mr. Clarke , is one of the sweetest Scottish songs . He is quite an enthusiast about it ; and I would take his taste in Scottish music against the taste of most connoisseurs .</p>
   <p>You are quite right in inserting the last five in your list , though they are certainly Irish . “ Shepherds , I have lost my love ! ” is to me a heavenly air — what would you think of a set of Scottish verses to it ? I have made one to it a good while ago , which I think * * *, but in its original state it is not quite a lady 's song . I enclose an altered , not amended copy for you ,<span corresp="#note216" type="note_anchor">[ 216 ]</span>if you choose to set the tune to it , and let the Irish verses follow .</p>
   <p>Mr. Erskine 's songs are all pretty , but his “ Lone-vale "[ 217 ] is divine .</p>

   <p>I have yours , my dear Sir , this moment . I shall answer it and your former letter , in my desultory way of saying whatever comes uppermost .</p>

     <l n="7">approve of , and return you .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Give me leave to criticise your taste in the only thing in which it is , in my opinion , reprehensible . You know I ought to know something of my own trade . Of pathos , sentiment , and point , you are a complete judge ; but there is a quality more necessary than either in a song , and which is the very essence of a ballad — I mean simplicity : now , if I mistake not , this last feature you are a little apt to sacrifice to the foregoing .</p>
   <p>Ramsay , as every other poet , has not been always equally happy in his pieces ; still I cannot approve of taking such liberties with an author as Mr. Walker proposes doing with “ The last time I came o'er the moor . ” Let a poet , if he choose , take up the idea of another , and work it into a piece of his own ; but to mangle the works of the poor bard , whose tuneful tongue is now mute for ever , in the dark and narrow house — by Heaven , ‘ twould be sacrilege ! I grant that Mr. W .' s version is an improvement ; but I know Mr. W. well , and esteem him much ; let him mend the song , as the Highlander mended his gun — he gave it a new stock , a new lock , and a new barrel .</p>
   <p>I do not , by this , object to leaving out improper stanzas , where that can be done without spoiling the whole . One stanza in “ The lass o ’ Patie 's mill ” must be left out : the song will be nothing worse for it . I am not sure if we can take the same liberty with “ Corn rigs are bonnie . ” Perhaps it might want the last stanza , and be the better for it . “ Cauld kail in Aberdeen , ” you must leave with me yet awhile . I have vowed to have a song to that air , on the lady whom I attempted to celebrate in the verses , “ Poortith cauld and restless love . ” At any rate , my other song , “ Green grow the rashes , ” will never suit . That song is current in Scotland under the old title , and to the merry old tune of that name , which , of course , would mar the progress of your song to celebrity . Your book will be the standard of Scots songs for the future : let this idea ever keep your judgment on the alarm .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I send a song on a celebrated toast in this country , to suit “ Bonnie</l>
     <l n="2">Dundee . ” I send you also a ballad to the “ Mill , mill , O ! "[ 218 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The last time I came o'er the moor , ” I would fain attempt to make a Scots song for , and let Ramsay 's be the English set . You shall hear from me soon . When you go to London on this business , can you come by Dumfries ? I have still several MS. Scots airs by me , which I have picked up , mostly from the singing of country lasses . They please me vastly ; but your learned lugs would perhaps be displeased with the very feature for which I like them . I call them simple ; you would pronounce them silly . Do you know a fine air called “ Jackie Hume 's Lament ? ” I have a song of considerable merit to that air . I 'll enclose you both the song and tune , as I had them ready to send to Johnson 's Museum .<span corresp="#note219" type="note_anchor">[ 219 ]</span>I send you likewise , to me , a beautiful little air , which I had taken down from viva voce .<span corresp="#note220" type="note_anchor">[ 220 ]</span></p>

   <p>MY DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I had scarcely put my last letter into the post-office , when I took up the subject of “ The last time I came o'er the moor , ” and ere I slept drew the outlines of the foregoing .<span corresp="#note221" type="note_anchor">[ 221 ]</span>How I have succeeded , I leave on this , as on every other occasion , to you to decide . I own my vanity is flattered , when you give my songs a place in your elegant and superb work ; but to be of service to the work is my first wish . As I have often told you , I do not in a single instance wish you , out of compliment to me , to insert anything of mine . One hint let me give you — whatever Mr. Pleyel does , let him not alter one iota of the original Scottish airs , I mean in the song department , but let our national music preserve its native features . They are , I own , frequently wild and irreducible to the more modern rules ; but on that very eccentricity , perhaps , depends a great part of their effect .</p>

    <p>TO JOHN FRANCIS ERSKINE , ESQ .,</p>
    <p>OF M A R .</p>
    <note>This remarkable letter has been of late the subject of some controversy : Mr. Findlater , who happened then to be in the Excise , is vehement in defence of the “ honourable board , ” and is certain that Burns has misrepresented the conduct of his very generous masters . In answer to this it has been urged that the word of the poet has in no other thing been questioned : that in the last moments of his life , he solemnly wrote this letter into his memorandum-book , and that the reproof of Mr. Corbet , is given by him either as a quotation from a paper or an exact recollection of the words used : the expressions , “ not to think ” and be “ silent and obedient ” are underlined .</note>
     <l n="1">Dumfries , 13th April , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Degenerate as human nature is said to be , and in many instances , worthless and unprincipled it is , still there are bright examples to the contrary ; examples that even in the eyes of superior beings , must shed a lustre on the name of man .</p>
   <p>Such an example have I now before me , when you , Sir , came forward to patronize and befriend a distant , obscure stranger , merely because poverty had made him helpless , and his British hardihood of mind had provoked the arbitrary wantonness of power . My much esteemed friend , Mr. Riddel of Glenriddel , has just read me a paragraph of a letter he had from you . Accept , Sir , of the silent throb of gratitude ; for words would but mock the emotions of my soul .</p>
   <p>You have been misinformed as to my final dismission from the Excise ; I am still in the service .— Indeed , but for the exertions of a gentleman who must be known to you , Mr. Graham of Fintray , a gentleman who has ever been my warm and generous friend , I had , without so much us a hearing , or the slightest previous intimation , been turned adrift , with my helpless family , to all the horrors of want . Had I had any other resource , probably I might have saved them the trouble of a dismission ; but the little money I gained by my publication , is almost every guinea embarked , to save from ruin an only brother , who , though one of the worthiest , is by no means one of the most fortunate of men .</p>
   <p>In my defence to their accusations , I said , that whatever might be my sentiments of republics , ancient or modern , as to Britain , I abjured the idea !— That a CONSTITUTION , which , in its original principles , experience had proved to be every way fitted for our happiness in society , it would be insanity to sacrifice to an untried visionary theory :— that , in consideration of my being situated in a department , however humble , immediately in the hands of people in power , I had forborne taking any active part , either personally , or as an author , in the present business of Reform . But , that , where I must declare my sentiments , I would say there existed a system of corruption between the executive power and the representative part of the legislature , which boded no good to our glorious CONSTITUTION ; and which every patriotic Briton must wish to see amended .— Some such sentiments as these , I stated in a letter to my generous patron , Mr. Graham , which he laid before the Board at large ; where , it seems , my last remark gave great offence ; and one of our supervisors-general , a Mr. Corbet , was instructed to inquire on the spot , and to document me — “ that my business was to act , not to think ; and that whatever might be men or measures , it was for me to be silent and obedient . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Corbet was likewise my steady friend ; so between Mr. Graham and him , I have been partly forgiven ; only I understand that all hopes of my getting officially forward , are blasted .</p>
   <p>Now , Sir , to the business in which I would more immediately interest you . The partiality of my COUNTRYMEN has brought me forward as a man of genius , and has given me a character to support . In the Poet I have avowed manly and independent sentiments , which I trust will be found in the man . Reasons of no less weight than the support of a wife and family , have pointed out as the eligible , and , situated as I was , the only eligible line of life for me , my present occupation . Still my honest fame is my dearest concern ; and a thousand times have I trembled at the idea of those degrading epithets that malice or misrepresentation may affix to my name . I have often , in blasting anticipation , listened to some future hackney scribbler , with the heavy malice of savage stupidity , exulting in his hireling paragraphs — “ Burns , notwithstanding the fanfaronade of independence to be found in his works , and after having been held forth to public view and to public estimation as a man of some genius , yet quite destitute of resources within himself to support his borrowed dignity , he dwindled into a paltry exciseman , and slunk out the rest of his insignificant existence in the meanest of pursuits , and among the vilest of mankind . ”</p>
   <p>In your illustrious hands , Sir , permit me to lodge my disavowal and defiance of these slanderous falsehoods . BURNS was a poor man from birth , and an exciseman by necessity : but I will say it ! the sterling of his honest worth , no poverty could debase , and his independent British mind , oppression might bend , but could not subdue . Have not I , to me , a more precious stake in my country 's welfare than the richest dukedom in it ?— I have a large family of children , and the prospect of many more . I have three sons , who , I see already , have brought into the world souls ill qualified to inhabit the bodies of SLAVES .— Can I look tamely on , and see any machination to wrest from them the birthright of my boys ,— the little independent BRITONS , in whose veins runs my own blood ?— No ! I will not ! should my heart 's blood stream around my attempt to defend it !</p>
   <p>Does any man tell me , that my full efforts can be of no service ; and that it does not belong to my humble station to meddle with the concern of a nation ?</p>
   <p>I can tell him , that it is on such individuals as I , that a nation has to rest , both for the hand of support , and the eye of intelligence . The uninformed mob may swell a nation 's bulk ; and the titled , tinsel , courtly throng , may be its feathered ornament ; but the number of those who are elevated enough in life to reason and to reflect ; yet low enough to keep clear of the venal contagion of a court !— these are a nation 's strength .</p>
   <p>I know not how to apologize for the impertinent length of this epistle ; but one small request I must ask of you further — when you have honoured this letter with a perusal , please to commit it to the flames . BURNS , in whose behalf you have so generously interested yourself , I have here in his native colours drawn as he is , but should any of the people in whose hands is the very bread he eats , get the least knowledge of the picture , it would ruin the poor BARD for ever !</p>
   <p>My poems having just come out in another edition , I beg leave to present you with a copy , as a small mark of that high esteem and ardent gratitude , with which I have the honour to be ,</p>

     <l n="1">April 26 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I am d — mnably out of humour , my dear Ainslie , and that is the reason , why I take up the pen to you : ‘ tis the nearest way ( probatum est ) to recover my spirits again .</p>
   <p>I received your last , and was much entertained with it ; but I will not at this time , nor at any other time , answer it .— Answer a letter ? I never could answer a letter in my life !— I have written many a letter in return for letters I have received ; but then — they were original matter — spurt-away ! zig here , zag there ; as if the devil that , my Grannie ( an old woman indeed ) often told me , rode on will-o ’ - wisp , or , in her more classic phrase , SPUNKIE , were looking over my elbow .— Happy thought that idea has engendered in my head ! SPUNKIE — thou shalt henceforth be my symbol signature , and tutelary genius ! Like thee , hap-step-and-lowp , here-awa-there-awa , higglety-pigglety , pell-mell , hither-and-yon , ram-stam , happy-go-lucky , up-tails-a ’ - by-the-light-o ’ - the-moon ,— has been , is , and shall be , my progress through the mosses and moors of this vile , bleak , barren wilderness of a life of ours .</p>
   <p>Come then , my guardian spirit , like thee may I skip away , amusing myself by and at my own light : and if any opaque-souled lubber of mankind complain that my elfine , lambent , glim merous wanderings have misled his stupid steps over precipices , or into bogs , let the thickheaded blunderbuss recollect , that he is not Spunkie :— that</p>

     <l n="2">Amid these perils none durst walk but he . ” —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have no doubt but scholar-craft may be caught , as a Scotchman catches the itch ,— by friction . How else can you account for it , that born blockheads , by mere dint of handling books , grow so wise that even they themselves are equally convinced of and surprised at their own parts ? I once carried this philosophy to that degree that in a knot of country folks who had a library amongst them , and who , to the honour of their good sense , made me factotum in the business ; one of our members , a little , wise-looking , squat , upright , jabbering body of a tailor , I advised him , instead of turning over the leaves , to bind the book on his back .— Johnnie took the hint ; and as our meetings were every fourth Saturday , and Pricklouse having a good Scots mile to walk in coming , and , of course , another in returning , Bodkin was sure to lay his hand on some heavy quarto , or ponderous folio , with , and under which , wrapt up in his gray plaid , he grew wise , as he grew weary , all the way home . He carried this so far , that an old musty Hebrew concordance , which we had in a present from a neighbouring priest , by mere dint of applying it , as doctors do a blistering plaster , between his shoulders , Stitch , in a dozen pilgrimages , acquired as much rational theology as the said priest had done by forty years perusal of the pages .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Permit me to present you with the enclosed song as a small though grateful tribute for the honour of your acquaintance . I have , in these verses , attempted some faint sketches of your portrait in the unembellished simple manner of descriptive TRUTH .— Flattery , I leave to your LOVERS , whose exaggerating fancies may make them imagine you still nearer perfection than you really are .</p>
   <p>Poets , Madam , of all mankind , feel most forcibly the powers of BEAUTY ; as , if they are really poets of nature 's making , their feelings must be finer , and their taste more delicate than most of the world . In the cheerful bloom of SPRING , or the pensive mildness of AUTUMN ; the grandeur of SUMMER , or the hoary majesty of WINTER , the poet feels a charm unknown to the rest of his species . Even the sight of a fine flower , or the company of a fine woman ( by far the finest part of God 's works below ) , have sensations for the poetic heart that the HERD of man are strangers to .— On this last account , Madam , I am , as in many other things , indebted to Mr. Hamilton 's kindness in introducing me to you . Your lovers may view you with a wish , I look on you with pleasure ; their hearts , in your presence , may glow with desire , mine rises with admiration .</p>
   <p>That the arrows of misfortune , however they should , as incident to humanity , glance a slight wound , may never reach your heart — that the snares of villany may never beset you in the road of life — that INNOCENCE may hand you by the path of honour to the dwelling of PEACE , is the sincere wish of him who has the honour to be , &amp; c .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>When I tell you , my dear Sir , that a friend of mine in whom I am much interested , has fallen a sacrifice to these accursed times , you will easily allow that it might unhinge me for doing any good among ballads . My own loss as to pecuniary matters is trifling ; but the total ruin of a much-loved friend is a loss indeed . Pardon my seeming inattention to your last commands .</p>
   <p>I cannot alter the disputed lines in the “ Mill Mill , O ! "[ 222 ] What you think a defect , I esteem as a positive beauty ; so you see how doctors differ . I shall now , with as much alacrity as I can muster , go on with your commands .</p>
   <p>You know Frazer , the hautboy-player in Edinburgh — he is here , instructing a band of music for a fencible corps quartered in this county . Among many of his airs that please me , there is one , well known as a reel , by the name of “ The Quaker 's Wife ; ” and which , I remember , a grand-aunt of mine used to sing , by the name of “ Liggeram Cosh , my bonnie wee lass . ” Mr. Frazer plays it slow , and with an expression that quite charms me .

   <p>Have you ever , my dear Sir , felt your bosom ready to burst with indignation , on reading of those mighty villains who divide kingdoms , desolate provinces , and lay nations waste , out of the wantonness of ambition , or often from still more ignoble passions ? In a mood of this kind to-day I recollected the air of “ Logan Water , ” and it occurred to me that its querulous melody probably had its origin from the plaintive indignation of some swelling , suffering heart , fired at the tyrannic strides of some public destroyer , and overwhelmed with private distress , the consequence of a country 's ruin . If I have done anything at all like justice to my feelings , the following song , composed in three-quarters of an hour 's meditation in my elbow-chair , ought to have some merit :—</p>

     <l n="1">July , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I assure you , my dear Sir , that you truly hurt me with your pecuniary parcel . It degrades me in my own eyes . However , to return it would savour of affectation ; but , as to any more traffic of that debtor and creditor kind , I swear by that HONOUR which crowns the upright statue of ROBERT BURNS 'S INTEGRITY — on the least motion of it , I will indignantly spurn the by-past transaction , and from that moment commence entire stranger to you ! BURNS 'S character for generosity of sentiment and independence of mind , will , I trust , long outlive any of his wants which the cold unfeeling ore can supply ; at least , I will take care that such a character he shall deserve .</p>
   <p>Thank you for my copy of your publication . Never did my eyes behold in any musical work such elegance and correctness . Your preface , too , is admirably written , only your partiality to me has made you say too much : however , it will bind me down to double every effort in the future progress of the work . The following are a few remarks on the songs in the list you sent me . I never copy what I write to you , so I may be often tautological , or perhaps contradictory .</p>
   <p>“ The Flowers o ’ the Forest , ” is charming as a poem , and should be , and must be , set to the notes ; but , though out of your rule , the three stanzas beginning ,</p>
   <p>“ I 've seen the smiling of fortune beguiling , ”</p>
   <p>are worthy of a place , were it but to immortalize the author of them , who is an old lady of my acquaintance , and at this moment living in Edinburgh . She is a Mrs. Cockburn , I forget of what place , but from Roxburghshire .<span corresp="#note228" type="note_anchor">[ 228 ]</span>What a charming apostrophe is</p>

     <l n="2">Why thus perplex us , poor sons of a day ? ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The old ballad , “ I wish I were where Helen lies , ” is silly to contemptibility . My alteration of it , in Johnson 's , is not much better . Mr. Pinkerton , in his , what he calls , ancient ballads ( many of them notorious , though beautiful enough , forgeries ) , has the best set . It is full of his own interpolations — but no matter .</p>
   <p>In my next I will suggest to your consideration a few songs which may have escaped your hurried notice . In the meantime allow me to congratulate you now , as a brother of the quill . You have committed your character and fame , which will now be tried , for ages to come , by the illustrious jury of the SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TASTE — all whom poesy can please or music charm .</p>
   <p>Being a bard of nature , I have some pretensions to second sight ; and I am warranted by the spirit to foretell and affirm , that your great-grand-child will hold up your volumes , and say , with honest pride , “ This so much admired selection was the work of my ancestor ! ”</p>

   <p>That crinkum-crankum tune , “ Robin Adair , ” has run so in my head , and I succeeded so ill in my last attempt , that I have ventured , in this morning 's walk , one essay more . You , my dear Sir , will remember an unfortunate part of our worthy friend Cunningham 's story , which happened about three years ago . That struck my fancy , and I endeavoured to do the idea justice as follows :</p>
   <p>Had I a cave on some wild distant shore .<span corresp="#note230" type="note_anchor">[ 230 ]</span></p>
   <p>By the way , I have met with a musical Highlander in Breadalbane 's Fencibles , which are quartered here , who assures me that he well remembers his mother singing Gaelic songs to both “ Robin Adair , ” and “ Grammachree . ” They certainly have more of the Scotch than Irish taste in them .</p>
   <p>This man comes from the vicinity of Inverness : so it could not be any intercourse with Ireland that could bring them ; except , what I shrewdly suspect to be the case , the wandering minstrels , harpers , and pipers , used to go frequently errant through the wilds both of Scotland and Ireland , and so some favourite airs might be common to both . A case in point — they have lately , in Ireland , published an Irish air , as they say , called “ Caun du delish . ” The fact is , in a publication of Corri 's , a great while ago , you will find the same air , called a Highland one , with a Gaelic song set to it . Its name there , I think , is “ Oran Gaoil , ” and a fine air it is . Do ask honest Allan or the Rev . Gaelic parson , about these matters .</p>

   <p>I walked out yesterday evening with a volume of the Museum in my hand , when turning up “ Allan Water , ” “ What numbers shall the muse repeat , ” &amp; c ., as the words appeared to me rather unworthy of so fine an air , and recollecting that it is on your list , I sat and raved under the shade of an old thorn , till I wrote one to suit the measure . I may be wrong ; but I think it not in my worst style . You must know , that in Ramsay 's Tea-table , where the modern song first appeared , the ancient name of the tune , Allan says , is “ Allan Water , ” or “ My love Annie 's very bonnie . ” This last has certainly been a line of the original song ; so I took up the idea , and , as you will see , have introduced the line in its place , which I presume it formerly occupied ; though I likewise give you a choosing line , if it should not hit the cut of your fancy :</p>
   <p>By Allan stream I chanced to rove .<span corresp="#note231" type="note_anchor">[ 231 ]</span></p>

   </lg>
   <p>That tune , “ Cauld kail , ” is such a favourite of yours , that I once more roved out yesterday for a gloamin-shot at the muses ; when the muse that presides o'er the shores of Nith , or rather my old inspiring dearest nymph , Coila , whispered me the following . I have two reasons for thinking that it was my early , sweet simple inspirer that was by my elbow , “ smooth gliding without step , ” and pouring the song on my glowing fancy . In the first place , since I left Coila 's native haunts , not a fragment of a poet has arisen to cheer her solitary musings , by catching inspiration from her , so I more than suspect that she has followed me hither , or , at least , makes me occasional visits ; secondly , the last stanza of this song I send you , is the very words that Coila taught me many years ago , and which I set to an old Scots reel in Johnson 's Museum .</p>

   <p>If you think the above will suit your idea of your favourite air , I shall be highly pleased . “ The last time I came o'er the moor ” I cannot meddle with , as to mending it ; and the musical world have been so long accustomed to Ramsay 's words , that a different song , though positively superior , would not be so well received .

    <p>TO MISS CRAIK .</p>
    <note>Miss Helen Craik of Arbigland , had merit both as a poetess and novelist : her ballads may be compared with those of Hector M'Neil : her novels had a seasoning of satire in them .</note>
     <l n="1">Dumfries , August , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Some rather unlooked-for accidents have prevented my doing myself the honour of a second visit to Arbigland , as I was so hospitably invited , and so positively meant to have done .— However , I still hope to have that pleasure before the busy months of harvest begin .</p>
   <p>I enclose you two of my late pieces , as some kind of return for the pleasure I have received in perusing a certain MS. volume of poems in the possession of Captain Riddel . To repay one with an old song , is a proverb , whose force , you , Madam , I know , will not allow . What is said of illustrious descent is , I believe , equally true of a talent for poetry , none ever despised it who had pretensions to it . The fates and characters of the rhyming tribe often employ my thoughts when I am disposed to be melancholy . There is not , among all the martyrologies that ever were penned , so rueful a narrative as the lives of the poets .— In the comparative view of wretches , the criterion is not what they are doomed to suffer , but how they are formed to bear . Take a being of our kind , give him a stronger imagination and a more delicate sensibility , which between them will ever engender a more ungovernable set of passions than are the usual lot of man ; implant in him an irresistible impulse to some idle vagary , such as arranging wild flowers in fantastical nosegays , tracing the grasshopper to his haunt by his chirping song , watching the frisks of the little minnows in the sunny pool , or hunting after the intrigues of butterflies — in short , send him adrift after some pursuit which shall eternally mislead him from the paths of lucre , and yet curse him with a keener relish than any man living for the pleasures that lucre can purchase ; lastly , fill up the measure of his woes by bestowing on him a spurning sense of his own dignity , and you have created a wight nearly as miserable as a poet . To you , Madam , I need not recount the fairy pleasures the muse bestows to counterbalance this catalogue of evils . Bewitching poetry is like bewitching woman ; she has in all ages been accused of misleading mankind from the councils of wisdom and the paths of prudence , involving them in difficulties , baiting them with poverty , branding them with infamy , and plunging them in the whirling vortex of ruin ; yet , where is the man but must own that all our happiness on earth is not worthy the name — that even the holy hermit 's solitary prospect of paradisiacal bliss is but the glitter of a northern sun rising over a frozen region , compared with the many pleasures , the nameless raptures that we owe to the lovely queen of the heart of man !</p>

   <p>When I am tempted to do anything improper , I dare not , because I look on myself as accountable to your ladyship and family . Now and then , when I have the honour to be called to the tables of the great , if I happen to meet with any mortification from the stately stupidity of self-sufficient squires , or the luxurious insolence of upstart nabobs , I get above the creatures by calling to remembrance that I am patronized by the noble house of Glencairn ; and at gala-times , such as new-year 's day , a christening , or the kirn-night , when my punch-bowl is brought from its dusty corner and filled up in honour of the occasion , I begin with ,— The Countess of Glencairn ! My good woman with the enthusiasm of a grateful heart , next cries , My Lord ! and so the toast goes on until I end with Lady Harriet 's little angel ! whose epithalamium I have pledged myself to write .</p>
   <p>When I received your ladyship 's letter , I was just in the act of transcribing for you some verses I have lately composed ; and meant to have sent them my first leisure hour , and acquainted you with my late change of life . I mentioned to my lord my fears concerning my farm . Those fears were indeed too true ; it is a bargain would have ruined me , but for the lucky circumstance of my having an excise commission .</p>
   <p>People may talk as they please , of the ignominy of the excise ; 50l . a year will support my wife and children , and keep me independent of the world ; and I would much rather have it said that my profession borrowed credit from me , than that I borrowed credit from my profession . Another advantage I have in this business , is the knowledge it gives me of the various shades of human character , consequently assisting me vastly in my poetic pursuits . I had the most ardent enthusiasm for the muses when nobody knew me , but myself , and that ardour is by no means cooled now that my lord Glencairn 's goodness has introduced me to all the world . Not that I am in haste for the press . I have no idea of publishing , else I certainly had consulted my noble generous patron ; but after acting the part of an honest man , and supporting my family , my whole wishes and views are directed to poetic pursuits . I am aware that though I were to give performances to the world superior to my former works , still if they were of the same kind with those , the comparative reception they would meet with would mortify me . I have turned my thoughts on the drama . I do not mean the stately buskin of the tragic muse .</p>
   <p>Does not your ladyship think that an Edinburgh theatre would be more amused with affectation , folly , and whim of true Scottish growth , than manners which by far the greatest part of the audience can only know at second hand ?</p>
   <p>I have the honour to be ,</p>
   <p>Your ladyship 's ever devoted</p>
   <p>And grateful humble servant ,</p>

    <note>Peter Pindar , the name under which it was the pleasure of that bitter but vulgar satirist , Dr. Wolcot , to write , was a man of little lyrical talent . He purchased a good annuity for the remainder of his life , by the copyright of his works , and survived his popularity many year .</note>

   </lg>
   <p>You may readily trust , my dear Sir , that any exertion in my power is heartily at your service . But one thing I must hint to you ; the very name of Peter Pindar is of great service to your publication , so get a verse from him now and then ; though I have no objection , as well as I can , to bear the burden of the business .</p>
   <p>You know that my pretensions to musical taste are merely a few of nature 's instincts , untaught and untutored by art . For this reason , many musical compositions , particularly where much of the merit lies in counterpoint , however they may transport and ravish the ears of your connoisseurs , affect my simple lug no otherwise than merely as melodious din . On the other hand , by way of amends , I am delighted with many little melodies , which the learned musician despises as silly and insipid . I do not know whether the old air “ Hey tuttie taitie , ” may rank among this number ; but well I know that , with Frazer 's haut-boy , it has often filled my eyes with tears . There is a tradition , which I have met with in many places in Scotland , that it was Robert Bruce 's march at the battle of Bannockburn . This thought , in yesternight 's evening walk , warmed me to a pitch of enthusiasm on the theme of liberty and independence , which I threw into a kind of Scottish ode , fitted to the air , that one might suppose to be the gallant Royal Scot 's address to his heroic followers on the eventful morning .</p>
   <p>Scots , wha hae wi ’ Wallace bled .<span corresp="#note237" type="note_anchor">[ 237 ]</span></p>
   <p>So may God ever defend the cause of truth and liberty , as he did that day ! Amen .</p>
   <p>P. S . I showed the air to Urbani , who was highly pleased with it , and begged me to make soft verses for it ; but I had no idea of giving myself any trouble on the subject , till the accidental recollection of that glorious struggle for freedom , associated with the glowing ideas of some other struggles of the same nature , not quite so ancient , roused my rhyming mania . Clarke 's set of the tune , with his bass , you will find in the Museum , though I am afraid that the air is not what will entitle it to a place in your elegant selection .<span corresp="#note238" type="note_anchor">[ 238 ]</span></p>

   <p>I dare say , my dear Sir , that you will begin to think my correspondence is persecution . No matter , I can n't help it ; a ballad is my hobby-horse , which , though otherwise a simple sort of harmless idiotical beast enough , has yet this blessed headstrong property , that when once it has fairly made off with a hapless wight , it gets so enamoured with the tinkle-gingle , tinkle-gingle of its own bells , that it is sure to run poor pilgarlick , the bedlam jockey , quite beyond any useful point or post in the common race of men .</p>
   <p>The following song I have composed for “ Oran-gaoil , ” the Highland air that , you tell me in your last , you have resolved to give a place to in your book . I have this moment finished the song , so you have it glowing from the mint . If it suit you , well !— If not , ‘ tis also well !</p>

   <p>“ Down the burn , Davie . ” I have this moment tried an alteration , leaving out the last half of the third stanza , and the first half of the last stanza , thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">As down the burn they took their way ,</l>
     <l n="2">And thro ’ the flowery dale ;</l>
     <l n="3">His cheek to hers he aft did lay ,</l>
     <l n="4">And love was aye the tale .</l>

     <l n="6">Sic pleasure to renew ? ”</l>
     <l n="7">Quoth Mary , “ Love , I like the burn ,</l>
     <l n="8">And aye shall follow you . "[ 240 ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Thro ’ the wood , laddie ” — I am decidedly of opinion that both in this , and “ There 'll never be peace till Jamie comes hame , ” the second or high part of the tune being a repetition of the first part an octave higher , is only for instrumental music , and would be much better omitted in singing .</p>
   <p>“ Cowden-knowes . ” Remember in your index that the song in pure English to this tune , beginning ,</p>
   <p>“ When summer comes , the swains on Tweed , ”</p>
   <p>is the production of Crawfurd . Robert was his Christian name .<span corresp="#note241" type="note_anchor">[ 241 ]</span></p>
   <p>“ Laddie , lie near me , ” must lie by me for some time . I do not know the air ; and until I am complete master of a tune , in my own singing ( such as it is ) , I can never compose for it . My way is : I consider the poetic sentiment correspondent to my idea of the musical expression ; then choose my theme ; begin one stanza : when that is composed , which is generally the most difficult part of the business , I walk out , sit down now and then , look out for objects of nature around me that are in unison and harmony with the cogitations of my fancy , and workings of my bosom ; humming every now and then the air with the verses I have framed . When I feel my muse beginning to jade , I retire to the solitary fire-side of my study , and there commit my effusions to paper ; swinging at intervals on the hind-legs of my elbow-chair , by way of calling forth my own critical strictures as my pen goes on . Seriously , this , at home , is almost invariably my way .</p>
   <p>What cursed egotism !</p>
   <p>“ Gil Morice ” I am for leaving out . It is a plaguy length ; the air itself is never sung ; and its place can well be supplied by one or two songs for fine airs that are not in your list — for instance “ Craigieburn-wood ” and “ Roy 's wife . ” The first , beside its intrinsic merit , has novelty , and the last has high merit as well as great celebrity . I have the original words of a song for the last air , in the handwriting of the lady who composed it ; and they are superior to any edition of the song which the public has yet seen .</p>
   <p>“ Highland laddie . ” The old set will please a mere Scotch ear best ; and the new an Italianised one . There is a third , and what Oswald calls the old “ Highland laddie , ” which pleases me more than either of them . It is sometimes called “ Ginglin Johnnie ; ” it being the air of an old humorous tawdry song of that name . You will find it in the Museum , “ I hae been at Crookieden , ” &amp; c. I would advise you , in the musical quandary , to offer up your prayers to the muses for inspiring direction ; and in the meantime , waiting for this direction , bestow a libation to Bacchus ; and there is not a doubt but you will hit on a judicious choice . Probatum est .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Auld Sir Simon ” I must beg you to leave out , and put in its place</l>
     <l n="2">“ The Quaker 's wife . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Blythe hae I been on yon hill ,"[ 242 ] is one of the finest songs ever I made in my life , and , besides , is composed on a young lady , positively the most beautiful , lovely woman in the world . As I purpose giving you the names and designations of all my heroines , to appear in some future edition of your work , perhaps half a century hence , you must certainly include “ The bonniest lass in a ’ the warld , ” in your collection .</p>
   <p>“ Dainty Davie ” I have heard sung nineteen thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine times , and always with the chorus to the low part of the tune ; and nothing has surprised me so much as your opinion on this subject . If it will not suit as I proposed , we will lay two of the stanzas together , and then make the chorus follow , exactly as Lucky Nancy in the Museum .</p>
   <p>“ Fee him , father : ” I enclose you Frazer 's set of this tune when he plays it slow : in fact he makes it the language of despair . I shall here give you two stanzas , in that style , merely to try if it will be any improvement . Were it possible , in singing , to give it half the pathos which Frazer gives it in playing , it would make an admirably pathetic song . I do not give these verses for any merit they have . I composed them at the time in which “ Patie Allan 's mither died — that was about the back o ’ midnight ; ” and by the lee-side of a bowl of punch , which had overset every mortal in company except the hautbois and the muse .</p>
   <p>Thou hast left me ever , Jamie .<span corresp="#note243" type="note_anchor">[ 243 ]</span></p>
   <p>“ Jockie and Jenny ” I would discard , and in its place would put “ There 's nae luck about the house ,"[ 244 ] which has a very pleasant air , and which is positively the finest love-ballad in that style in the Scottish , or perhaps in any other language . “ When she came ben she bobbit , ” as an air is more beautiful than either , and in the andante way would unite with a charming sentimental ballad .</p>
   <p>“ Saw ye my father ? ” is one of my greatest favourites . The evening before last , I wandered out , and began a tender song , in what I think is its native style . I must premise that the old way , and the way to give most effect , is to have no starting note , as the fiddlers call it , but to burst at once into the pathos . Every country girl sings “ Saw ye my father ? ” &amp; c .</p>
   <p>My song is but just begun ; and I should like , before I proceed , to know your opinion of it . I have sprinkled it with the Scottish dialect , but it may be easily turned into correct English .<span corresp="#note245" type="note_anchor">[ 245 ]</span></p>
   <p>“ Todlin hame . ” Urbani mentioned an idea of his , which has long been mine , that this air is highly susceptible of pathos : accordingly , you will soon hear him at your concert try it to a song of mine in the Museum , “ Ye banks and braes o ’ bonnie Doon . ” One song more and I have done ; “ Auld lang syne . ” The air is but mediocre ; but the following song , the old song of the olden times , and which has never been in print , nor even in manuscript , until I took it down from an old man 's singing , is enough to recommend any air .<span corresp="#note246" type="note_anchor">[ 246 ]</span></p>
   <p>Now , I suppose , I have tried your patience fairly . You must , after all is over , have a number of ballads , properly so called . “ Gil Morice , ” “ Tranent Muir , ” “ Macpherson 's farewell , ” “ Battle of Sherriff-muir , ” or , “ We ran , and they ran , ” ( I know the author of this charming ballad , and his history ,) “ Hardiknute , ” “ Barbara Allan ” ( I can furnish a finer set of this tune than any that has yet appeared ;) and besides do you know that I really have the old tune to which “ The cherry and the slae ” was sung , and which is mentioned as a well-known air in “ Scotland 's Complaint , ” a book published before poor Mary 's days ?<span corresp="#note247" type="note_anchor">[ 247 ]</span>It was then called “ The banks of Helicon ; ” an old poem which Pinkerton has brought to light . You will see all this in Tytler 's history of Scottish music . The tune , to a learned ear , may have no great merit ; but it is a great curiosity . I have a good many original things of this kind .</p>

    <note>The poet 's good sense rose at last in arms against the criticisms of the musician , and he refused to lessen the dignity of his war-ode by any more alterations .</note>

   <p>“ Who shall decide when doctors disagree ? ” My ode pleases me so much that I cannot alter it . Your proposed alterations would , in my opinion , make it tame . I am exceedingly obliged to you for putting me on reconsidering it , as I think I have much improved it . Instead of “ sodger ! hero ! ” I will have it “ Caledonian , on wi ’ me ! ”</p>
   <p>I have scrutinized it over and over ; and to the world , some way or other , it shall go as it is . At the same time it will not in the least hurt me , should you leave it out altogether , and adhere to your first intention of adopting Logan 's verses .</p>
   <p>I have finished my song to “ Saw ye my father ? ” and in English , as you will see . That there is a syllable too much for the expression of the air , is true ; but , allow me to say , that the mere dividing of a dotted crotchet into a crotchet and a quaver , is not a great matter : however , in that I have no pretensions to cope in judgment with you . Of the poetry I speak with confidence ; but the music is a business where I hint my ideas with the utmost diffidence .</p>
   <p>The old verses have merit , though unequal , and are popular : my advice is to set the air to the old words , and let mine follow as English verses . Here they are :—</p>
   <p>Where are the joys I have met in the morning ?<span corresp="#note249" type="note_anchor">[ 249 ]</span></p>

   <p>I have been turning over some volumes of songs , to find verses whose measures would suit the airs for which you have allotted me to find English songs .</p>
   <p>For “ Muirland Willie , ” you have , in Ramsay 's Tea-Table , an excellent song beginning , “ Ah , why those tears in Nelly 's eyes ? ” As for “ The Collier 's Dochter , ” take the following old bacchanal :—</p>
   <p>“ Deluded swain , the pleasure , &amp; c ."[ 250 ]</p>
   <p>The faulty line in Logan-Water , I mend thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">How can your flinty hearts enjoy</l>
     <l n="2">The widow 's tears , the orphan 's cry ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The song otherwise will pass . As to “ M'Gregoira RuahYpppHeNRuth , ” you will see a song of mine to it , with a set of the air superior to yours , in the Museum , vol . ii . p. 181 . The song begins ,</p>
   <p>Raving winds around her blowing .<span corresp="#note251" type="note_anchor">[ 251 ]</span></p>
   <p>Your Irish airs are pretty , but they are rank Irish . If they were like the “ Banks of Banna , ” for instance , though really Irish , yet in the Scottish taste , you might adopt them . Since you are so fond of Irish music , what say you to twenty-five of them in an additional number ? We could easily find this quantity of charming airs ; I will take care that you shall not want songs ; and I assure you that you would find it the most saleable of the whole . If you do not approve of “ Roy 's wife , ” for the music 's sake , we shall not insert it . “ Deil tak the wars ” is a charming song ; so is , “ Saw ye my Peggy ? ” “ There 's nae luck about the house ” well deserves a place . I cannot say that “ O'er the hills and far awa ” strikes me as equal to your selection . “ This is no my ain house , ” is a great favourite air of mine ; and if you will send me your set of it , I will task my muse to her highest effort . What is your opinion of “ I hae laid a herrin ’ in saut ? ” I like it much . Your jacobite airs are pretty , and there are many others of the same kind pretty ; but you have not room for them . You cannot , I think , insert “ Fy ! let 's a ’ to the bridal , ” to any other words than its own .</p>
   <p>What pleases me , as simple and naive , disgusts you as ludicrous and low . For this reason , “ Fy ! gie me my coggie , Sirs , ” “ Fy let 's a ’ to the bridal , ” with several others of that cast , are to me highly pleasing ; while “ Saw ye my father , or saw ye my mother ? ” delights me with its descriptive simple pathos . Thus my song , “ Ken ye what Meg o ’ the mill has gotten ? ” pleases myself so much , that I cannot try my hand at another song to the air , so I shall not attempt it . I know you will laugh at all this : but “ ilka man wears his belt his ain gait . ”</p>

   <p>I am pleased that you are reconciled to the air of the “ Quaker 's wife ; ” though , by the bye , an old Highland gentleman , and a deep antiquarian , tells me it is a Gaelic air , and known by the name of “ Leiger m ’ choss . ” The following verses , I hope , will please you , as an English song to the air .</p>
   <p>Thine am I , my faithful fair :[ 253 ]</p>
   <p>Your objection to the English song I proposed for “ John Anderson my jo , ” is certainly just . The following is by an old acquaintance of mine , and I think has merit . The song was never in print , which I think is so much in your favour . The more original good poetry your collection contains , it certainly has so much the more merit .</p>

   <p>The following address of Turnbull 's to the Nightingale will suit as an English song to the air “ There was a lass , and she was fair . ” By the bye , Turnbull has a great many songs in MS ., which I can command , if you like his manner . Possibly , as he is an old friend of mine , I may be prejudiced in his favour ; but I like some of his pieces very much .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>‘ Tis said that we take the greatest liberties with our greatest friends , and I pay myself a very high compliment in the manner in which I am going to apply the remark . I have owed you money longer than ever I owed it to any man . Here is Kerr 's account , and here are the six guineas ; and now I do n't owe a shilling to man — or woman either . But for these d —— d dirty , dog'shYpppHeNear ' d little pages ,<span corresp="#note255" type="note_anchor">[ 255 ]</span>I had done myself the honour to have waited on you long ago . Independent of the obligations your hospitality has laid me under , the consciousness of your superiority in the rank of man and gentleman , of itself was fully as much as I could ever make head against ; but to owe you money too , was more than I could face .</p>
   <p>I think I once mentioned something to you of a collection of Scots songs I have for some years been making : I send you a perusal of what I have got together . I could not conveniently spare them above five or six days , and five or six glances of them will probably more than suffice you . When you are tired of them , please leave them with Mr. Clint , of the King 's Arms . There is not another copy of the collection in the world ; and I should be sorry that any unfortunate negligence should deprive me of what has cost me a good deal of pains .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Heated as I was with wine yesternight , I was perhaps rather seemingly impertinent in my anxious wish to be honoured with your acquaintance . You will forgive it : it was the impulse of heart-felt respect . “ He is the father of the Scottish county reform , and is a man who does honour to the business , at the same time that the business does honour to him , ” said my worthy friend Glenriddel to somebody by me who was talking of your coming to this county with your corps . “ Then , ” I said , “ I have a woman 's longing to take him by the hand , and say to him , ‘ Sir , I honour you as a man to whom the interests of humanity are dear , and as a patriot to whom the rights of your country are sacred . ’ ”</p>
   <p>In times like these , Sir , when our commoners are barely able by the glimmer of their own twilight understandings to scrawl a frank , and when lords are what gentlemen would be ashamed to be , to whom shall a sinking country call for help ? To the independent country gentleman . To him who has too deep a stake in his country not to be in earnest for her welfare ; and who in the honest pride of a man can view with equal contempt the insolence of office and the allurements of corruption .</p>
   <p>I mentioned to you a Scots ode or song I had lately composed , and which I think has some merit . Allow me to enclose it . When I fall in with you at the theatre , I shall be glad to have your opinion of it . Accept it , Sir , as a very humble but most sincere tribute of respect from a man , who , dear as he prizes poetic fame , yet holds dearer an independent mind .</p>

    <head>You were so very good as to promise me to honour my friend with your presence on his benefit night . That night is fixed for Friday first : the play a most interesting one ! “ The Way to Keep Him . ” I have the pleasure to know Mr. G. well . His merit as an actor is generally acknowledged . He has genius and worth which would do honour to patronage : he is a poor and modest man ; claims which from their very silence have the more forcible power on the generous heart . Alas , for pity ! that from the indolence of those who have the good things of this life in their gift , too often does brazen-fronted importunity snatch that boon , the rightful due of retiring , humble want ! Of all the qualities we assign to the author and director of nature , by far the most enviable is — to be able “ to wipe away all tears from all eyes . ” O what insignificant , sordid wretches are they , however chance may have loaded them with wealth , who go to their graves , to their magnificent mausoleums , with hardly the consciousness of having made one poor honest heart happy !</head>

I enclose you a song which I composed since I saw you , and I am going to give you the history of it . Do you know that among much that I admire in the characters and manners of those great folks whom I have now the honour to call my acquaintances , the Oswald family , there is nothing charms me more than Mr. Oswald 's unconcealable attachment to that incomparable woman . Did you ever , my dear Syme , meet with a man who owed more to the Divine Giver of all good things than Mr. O .? A fine fortune ; a pleasing exterior ; self-evident amiable dispositions , and an ingenuous upright mind , and that informed , too , much beyond the usual run of young fellows of his rank and fortune : and to all this , such a woman !— but of her I shall say nothing at all , in despair of saying anything adequate : in my song I have endeavoured to do justice to what would be his feelings , on seeing , in the scene I have drawn , the habitation of his Lucy . As I am a good deal pleased with my performance , I , in my first fervour , thought of sending it to Mrs. Oswald , but on second thoughts , perhaps what I offer as the honest incense of genuine respect , might , from the well-known character of poverty and poetry , be construed into some modification or other of that servility which my soul abhors .</p>

   <p>MADAM ,</p>
   <p>Nothing short of a kind of absolute necessity could have made me trouble you with this letter . Except my ardent and just esteem for your sense , taste , and worth , every sentiment arising in my breast , as I put pen to paper to you , is painful . The scenes I have passed with the friend of my soul and his amiable connexions ! the wrench at my heart to think that he is gone , for ever gone from me , never more to meet in the wanderings of a weary world ! and the cutting reflection of all , that I had most unfortunately , though most undeservedly , lost the confidence of that soul of worth , ere it took its flight !</p>
   <p>These , Madam , are sensations of no ordinary anguish .— However , you also may be offended with some imputed improprieties of mine ; sensibility you know I possess , and sincerity none will deny me .</p>
   <p>To oppose those prejudices which have been raised against me , is not the business of this letter . Indeed it is a warfare I know not how to wage . The powers of positive vice I can in some degree calculate , and against direct malevolence I can be on my guard ; but who can estimate the fatuity of giddy caprice , or ward off the unthinking mischief of precipitate folly ?</p>
   <p>I have a favour to request of you , Madam , and of your sister Mrs. ——, through your means . You know that , at the wish of my late friend , I made a collection of all my trifles in verse which I had ever written . They are many of them local , some of them puerile and silly , and all of them unfit for the public eye . As I have some little fame at stake , a fame that I trust may live when the hate of those who “ watch for my halting , ” and the contumelious sneer of those whom accident has made my superiors , will , with themselves , be gone to the regions of oblivion ; I am uneasy now for the fate of those manuscripts — Will Mrs. —— have the goodness to destroy them , or return them to me ? As a pledge of friendship they were bestowed ; and that circumstance indeed was all their merit . Most unhappily for me , that merit they no longer possess ; and I hope that Mrs. —— ‘ s goodness , which I well know , and ever will revere , will not refuse this favour to a man whom she once held in some degree of estimation .</p>
   <p>With the sincerest esteem ,</p>

    <note>The religious feeling of Burns was sometimes blunted , but at times it burst out , as in this letter , with eloquence and fervour , mingled with fear .</note>
     <l n="1">25th February , 1794 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Canst thou minister to a mind diseased ? Canst thou speak peace and rest to a soul tost on a sea of troubles , without one friendly star to guide her course , and dreading that the next surge may overwhelm her ? Canst thou give to a frame tremblingly alive as the tortures of suspense , the stability and hardihood of the rock that braves the blast ? If thou canst not do the least of these , why wouldst thou disturb me in my miseries , with thy inquiries after me ?</p>
   <p>For these two months I have not been able to lift a pen . My constitution and frame were , ab origine , blasted with a deep incurable taint of hypochondria , which poisons my existence . Of late a number of domestic vexations , and some pecuniary share in the ruin of these cursed times ; losses which , though trifling , were yet what I could ill bear , have so irritated me , that my feelings at times could only be envied by a reprobate spirit listening to the sentence that dooms it to perdition .</p>
   <p>Are you deep in the language of consolation ? I have exhausted in reflection every topic of comfort . A heart at ease would have been charmed with my sentiments and reasonings ; but as to myself I was like Judas Iscariot preaching the gospel ; he might melt and mould the hearts of those around him , but his own kept its native incorrigibility .</p>
   <p>Still there are two great pillars that bear us up , amid the wreck of misfortune and misery . The one is composed of the different modifications of a certain noble stubborn something in man , known by the names of courage , fortitude , magnanimity . The other is made up of those feelings and sentiments , which , however the sceptic may deny them , or the enthusiast disfigure them , are yet , I am convinced , original and component parts of the human soul ; those senses of the mind , if I may be allowed the expression , which connect us with , and link us to , those awful , obscure realities — an all-powerful , and equally beneficent God ; and a world to come , beyond death and the grave . The first gives the nerve of combat , while a ray of hope beams on the field : the last pours the balm of comfort into the wounds which time can never cure .</p>
   <p>I do not remember , my dear Cunningham , that you and I ever talked on the subject of religion at all . I know some who laugh at it , as the trick of the crafty few , to lead the undiscerning MANY ; or at most as an uncertain obscurity , which mankind can never know anything of , and with which they are fools if they give themselves much to do . Nor would I quarrel with a man for his irreligion , any more than I would for his want of a musical ear . I would regret that he was shut out from what , to me and to others , were such superlative sources of enjoyment . It is in this point of view , and for this reason , that I will deeply imbue the mind of every child of mine with religion . If my son should happen to be a man of feeling , sentiment , and taste , I shall thus add largely to his enjoyments . Let me flatter myself that this sweet little fellow , who is just now running about my desk , will be a man of a melting , ardent , glowing heart ; and an imagination , delighted with the painter , and rapt with the poet . Let me figure him wandering out in a sweet evening , to inhale the balmy gales , and enjoy the growing luxuriance of spring ; himself the while in the blooming youth of life . He looks abroad on all nature , and through nature up to nature 's God . His soul , by swift delighting degrees , is rapt above this sublunary sphere , until he can be silent no longer , and bursts out into the glorious enthusiasm of Thomson ,</p>

     <l n="2">Are but the varied God .— The rolling year</l>
     <l n="3">Is full of thee . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And so on , in all the spirit and ardour of that charming hymn . These are no ideal pleasures , they are real delights ; and I ask what of the delights among the sons of men are superior , not to say equal to them ? And they have this precious , vast addition , that conscious virtue stamps them for her own ; and lays hold on them to bring herself into the presence of a witnessing , judging , and approving God .</p>

   <p>MY LORD ,</p>
   <p>When you cast your eye on the name at the bottom of this letter , and on the title-page of the book I do myself the honour to send your lordship , a more pleasurable feeling than my vanity tells me that it must be a name not entirely unknown to you . The generous patronage of your late illustrious brother found me in the lowest obscurity : he introduced my rustic muse to the partiality of my country ; and to him I owe all . My sense of his goodness , and the anguish of my soul at losing my truly noble protector and friend , I have endeavoured to express in a poem to his memory , which I have now published . This edition is just from the press ; and in my gratitude to the dead , and my respect for the living ( fame belies you , my lord , if you possess not the same dignity of man , which was your noble brother 's characteristic feature ) , I had destined a copy for the Earl of Glencairn . I learnt just now that you are in town :— allow me to present it you .</p>
   <p>I know , my lord , such is the vile , venal contagion which pervades the world of letters , that professions of respect from an author , particularly from a poet , to a lord , are more than suspicious . I claim my by-past conduct , and my feelings at this moment , as exceptions to the too just conclusion . Exalted as are the honours of your lordship 's name , and unnoted as is the obscurity of mine ; with the uprightness of an honest man , I come before your lordship with an offering , however humble , ‘ tis all I have to give , of my grateful respect ; and to beg of you , my lord ,— ‘ tis all I have to ask of you ,— that you will do me the honour to accept of it .</p>

   <p>The last evening , as I was straying out , and thinking of “ O'er the hills and far away , ” I spun the following stanza for it ; but whether my spinning will deserve to be laid up in store , like the precious thread of the silk-worm , or brushed to the devil , like the vile manufacture of the spider , I leave , my dear Sir , to your usual candid criticism . I was pleased with several lines in it at first , but I own that now it appears rather a flimsy business .</p>

   <p>I shall withdraw my “ On the seas and far away ” altogether : it is unequal , and unworthy the work . Making a poem is like begetting a son : you cannot know whether you have a wise man or a fool , until you produce him to the world to try him .</p>
   <p>For that reason I send you the offspring of my brain , abortions and all ; and , as such , pray look over them , and forgive them , and burn them . I am flattered at your adopting “ Ca ’ the yowes to the knowes , ” as it was owing to me that ever it saw the light . About seven years ago I was well acquainted with a worthy little fellow of a clergyman , a Mr. Clunie , who sang it charmingly ; and , at my request , Mr. Clarke took it down from his singing . When I gave it to Johnson , I added some stanzas to the song , and mended others , but still it will not do for you . In a solitary stroll which I took to-day , I tried my hand on a few pastoral lines , following up the idea of the chorus , which I would preserve . Here it is , with all its crudities and imperfections on its head .</p>

   <p>Do you know a blackguard Irish song called “ Onagh 's Waterfall ? ” The air is charming , and I have often regretted the want of decent verses to it . It is too much , at least for my humble rustic muse , to expect that every effort of hers shall have merit ; still I think that it is better to have mediocre verses to a favourite air , than none at all . On this principle I have all along proceeded in the Scots Musical Museum ; and as that publication is at its last volume , I intend the following song , to the air above mentioned , for that work .</p>
   <p>If it does not suit you as an editor , you may be pleased to have verses to it that you can sing in the company of ladies .</p>
   <p>Sae flaxen were her ringlets .<span corresp="#note260" type="note_anchor">[ 260 ]</span></p>
   <p>Not to compare small things with great , my taste in music is like the mighty Frederick of Prussia 's taste in painting : we are told that he frequently admired what the connoisseurs decried , and always without any hypocrisy confessed his admiration . I am sensible that my taste in music must be inelegant and vulgar , because people of undisputed and cultivated taste can find no merit in my favourite tunes . Still , because I am cheaply pleased , is that any reason why I should deny myself that pleasure ? Many of our strathspeys , ancient and modern , give me most exquisite enjoyment , where you and other judges would probably be showing disgust . For instance , I am just now making verses for “ Rothemurche 's rant , ” an air which puts me in raptures ; and , in fact , unless I be pleased with the tune , I never can make verses to it . Here I have Clarke on my side , who is a judge that I will pit against any of you . “ Rothemurche , ” he says , “ is an air both original and beautiful ; ” and , on his recommendation , I have taken the first part of the tune for a chorus , and the fourth or last part for the song . I am but two stanzas deep in the work , and possibly you may think , and justly , that the poetry is as little worth your attention as the music .</p>
   <note>Here follow two stanzas of the song , beginning “ Lassie wi ’ the lint-white locks . ” Song CCXXXIII .</note>
   <p>I have begun anew , “ Let me in this ae night . ” Do you think that we ought to retain the old chorus ? I think we must retain both the old chorus and the first stanza of the old song . I do not altogether like the third line of the first stanza , but cannot alter it to please myself . I am just three stanzas deep in it . Would you have the denouement to be successful or otherwise ?— should she “ let him in ” or not ?</p>
   <p>Did you not once propose “ The sow 's tail to Geordie ” as an air for your work ? I am quite delighted with it ; but I acknowledge that is no mark of its real excellence . I once set about verses for it , which I meant to be in the alternate way of a lover and his mistress chanting together . I have not the pleasure of knowing Mrs. Thomson 's Christian name , and yours , I am afraid , is rather burlesque for sentiment , else I had meant to have made you the hero and heroine of the little piece .</p>

   <p>MY DEAR FRIEND ,</p>
   <p>By this morning 's post I have your list , and , in general , I highly approve of it . I shall , at more leisure , give you a critique on the whole . Clarke goes to your town by to-day 's fly , and I wish you would call on him and take his opinion in general : you know his taste is a standard . He will return here again in a week or two , so please do not miss asking for him . One thing I hope he will do — persuade you to adopt my favourite “ Craigieburn-wood , ” in your selection : it is as great a favourite of his as of mine . The lady on whom it was made is one of the finest women in Scotland ; and in fact ( entre nous ) is in a manner to me what Sterne 's Eliza was to him — a mistress , or friend , or what you will , in the guileless simplicity of Platonic love . ( Now , do n't put any of your squinting constructions on this , or have any clishmaclaver about it among our acquaintances . ) I assure you that to my lovely friend you are indebted for many of your best songs of mine . Do you think that the sober , gin-horse routine of existence could inspire a man with life , and love , and joy — could fire him with enthusiasm , or melt him with pathos , equal to the genius of your book ? No ! no ! Whenever I want to be more than ordinary in song — to be in some degree equal to your diviner airs — do you imagine I fast and pray for the celestial emanation ? Tout au contraire ! I have a glorious recipe ; the very one that for his own use was invented by the divinity of healing and poetry , when erst he piped to the flocks of Admetus . I put myself in a regimen of admiring a fine woman ; and in proportion to the adorability of her charms , in proportion you are delighted with my verses . The lightning of her eye is the godhead of Parnassus , and the witchery of her smile the divinity of Helicon !</p>
   <p>To descend to business : if you like my idea of “ When she cam ben she bobbit , ” the following stanzas of mine , altered a little from what they were formerly , when set to another air , may perhaps do instead of worse stanzas :—</p>
   <p>O saw ye my dear , my Phely .<span corresp="#note261" type="note_anchor">[ 261 ]</span></p>
   <p>Now for a few miscellaneous remarks . “ The Posie ” ( in the Museum ) is my composition ; the air was taken down from Mrs. Burns 's voice . It is well known in the west country , but the old words are trash . By the bye , take a look at the tune again , and tell me if you do not think it is the original from which “ Roslin Castle ” is composed . The second part in particular , for the first two or three bars , is exactly the old air . “ Strathallan 's Lament ” is mine ; the music is by our right trusty and deservedly well-beloved Allan Masterton . “ Donocht-Head ” is not mine ; I would give ten pounds it were . It appeared first in the Edinburgh Herald , and came to the editor of that paper with the Newcastle post-mark on it “ Whistle o'er the lave o't ” is mine : the music said to be by a John Bruce , a celebrated violin-player in Dumfries , about the beginning of this century . This I know , Bruce , who was an honest man , though a red-wud Highlandman , constantly claimed it ; and by all the old musical people here is believed to be the author of it .</p>
   <p>“ Andrew and his cutty gun . ” The song to which this is set in the Museum is mine , and was composed on Miss Euphemia Murray , of Lintrose , commonly and deservedly called the Flower of Strathmore .</p>
   <p>“ How long and dreary is the night ! ” I met with some such words in a collection of songs somewhere , which I altered and enlarged ; and to please you , and to suit your favourite air , I have taken a stride or two across my room , and have arranged it anew , as you will find on the other page .</p>
   <p>How long and dreary is the night , &amp; c.<span corresp="#note262" type="note_anchor">[ 262 ]</span></p>
   <p>Tell me how you like this . I differ from your idea of the expression of the tune . There is , to me , a great deal of tenderness in it . You cannot , in my opinion , dispense with a bass to your addenda airs . A lady of my acquaintance , a noted performer , plays and sings at the same time so charmingly , that I shall never bear to see any of her songs sent into the world , as naked as Mr. What-d'yehYpppHeNcallhYpppHeNum has done in his London collection .<span corresp="#note263" type="note_anchor">[ 263 ]</span></p>
   <p>These English songs gravel me to death . I have not that command of the language that I have of my native tongue . I have been at “ Duncan Gray , ” to dress it in English , but all I can do is deplorably stupid . For instance :—</p>
   <p>Let not woman e'er complain , &amp; c.<span corresp="#note264" type="note_anchor">[ 264 ]</span></p>
   <p>Since the above , I have been out in the country , taking a dinner with a friend , where I met with a lady whom I mentioned in the second page in this odds-and-ends of a letter . As usual , I got into song ; and returning home I composed the following :</p>
   <p>Sleep'st thou , or wak'st thou , fairest creature &amp; c.<span corresp="#note265" type="note_anchor">[ 265 ]</span></p>
   <p>If you honour my verses by setting the air to them , I will vamp up the old song , and make it English enough to be understood .</p>
   <p>I enclose you a musical curiosity , an East Indian air , which you would swear was a Scottish one . I know the authenticity of it , as the gentleman who brought it over is a particular acquaintance of mine . Do preserve me the copy I send you , as it is the only one I have . Clarke has set a bass to it , and I intend putting it into the Musical Museum . Here follow the verses I intend for it .</p>
   <p>But lately seen in gladsome green , &amp; c.<span corresp="#note266" type="note_anchor">[ 266 ]</span></p>
   <p>I would be obliged to you if you would procure me a sight of Ritson 's collection of English songs , which you mention in your letter . I will thank you for another information , and that as speedily as you please : whether this miserable drawling hotch-potch epistle has not completely tired you of my correspondence ?</p>

   <p>Many thanks to you , my dear Sir , for your present ; it is a book of the utmost importance to me . I have yesterday begun my anecdotes , &amp; c ., for your work . I intend drawing them up in the form of a letter to you , which will save me from the tedious dull business of systematic arrangement . Indeed , as all I have to say consists of unconnected remarks , anecdotes , scraps of old songs , &amp; c ., it would be impossible to give the work a beginning , a middle , and an end , which the critics insist to be absolutely necessary in a work . In my last , I told you my objections to the song you had selected for “ My lodging is on the cold ground . ” On my visit the other day to my friend Chloris ( that is the poetic name of the lovely goddess of my inspiration ) , she suggested an idea , which I , on my return from the visit , wrought into the following song .</p>
   <p>My Chloris , mark how green the groves .<span corresp="#note267" type="note_anchor">[ 267 ]</span></p>
   <p>How do you like the simplicity and tenderness of this pastoral ? I think it pretty well .</p>
   <p>I like you for entering so candidly and so kindly into the story of “ ma chere amie . ” I assure you I was never more in earnest in my life , than in the account of that affair which I sent you in my last . Conjugal love is a passion which I deeply feel , and highly venerate ; but , somehow , it does not make such a figure in poesy as that other species of the passion ,</p>
   <p>“ Where love is liberty , and nature law . ”</p>
   <p>Musically speaking , the first is an instrument of which the gamut is scanty and confined , but the tones inexpressibly sweet , while the last has powers equal to all the intellectual modulations of the human soul . Still , I am a very poet in my enthusiasm of the passion . The welfare and happiness of the beloved object is the first and inviolate sentiment that pervades my soul ; and whatever pleasures I might wish for , or whatever might be the raptures they would give me , yet , if they interfere with that first principle , it is having these pleasures at a dishonest price ; and justice forbids and generosity disdains the purchase .</p>
   <p>Despairing of my own powers to give you variety enough in English songs , I have been turning over old collections , to pick out songs , of which the measure is something similar to what I want ; and , with a little alteration , so as to suit the rhythm of the air exactly , to give you them for your work . Where the songs have hitherto been but little noticed , nor have ever been set to music , I think the shift a fair one . A song , which , under the same first verse , you will find in Ramsay 's Tea-table Miscellany , I have cut down for an English dress to your “ Dainty Davie , ” as follows :—</p>
   <p>It was the charming month of May .<span corresp="#note268" type="note_anchor">[ 268 ]</span></p>
   <p>You may think meanly of this , but take a look at the bombast original , and you will be surprised that I have made so much of it . I have finished my song to “ Rothemurche 's rant , ” and you have Clarke to consult as to the set of the air for singing .</p>
   <p>Lassie wi ’ the lint-white locks , &amp; c.<span corresp="#note269" type="note_anchor">[ 269 ]</span></p>
   <p>This piece has at least the merit of being a regular pastoral : the vernal morn , the summer noon , the autumnal evening , and the winter night , are regularly rounded . If you like it , well ; if not , I will insert it in the Museum .</p>

   <p>CCCIV .</p>
   <p>TO MR. THOMSON .</p>
   <note>Sir Walter Scott remarked , on the lyrics of Burns , “ that at last the writing a series of songs for large musical collections degenerated into a slavish labour which no talents could support . ”</note>
   <p>I am out of temper that you should set so sweet , so tender an air , as “ Deil tak the wars , ” to the foolish old verses . You talk of the silliness of “ Saw ye my father ? ” — By heavens ! the odds is gold to brass ! Besides , the old song , though now pretty well modernized into the Scottish language , is originally , and in the early editions , a bungling low imitation of the Scottish manner , by that genius Tom D'Urfey , so has no pretensions to be a Scottish production . There is a pretty English song by Sheridan , in the “ Duenna , ” to this air , which is out of sight superior to D'Urfey ' s . It begins ,</p>
   <p>“ When sable night each drooping plant restoring . ”</p>
   <p>The air , if I understand the expression of it properly , is the very native language of simplicity , tenderness , and love . I have again gone over my song to the tune .</p>
   <p>Now for my English song to “ Nancy 's to the greenwood , ” &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Farewell thou stream that winding flows .<span corresp="#note270" type="note_anchor">[ 270 ]</span></p>
   <p>There is an air , “ The Caledonian Hunt 's Delight , ” to which I wrote a song that , you will find in Johnson , “ Ye banks and braes o ’ bonnie Doon : ” this air I think might find a place among your hundred , as Lear says of his knights . Do you know the history of the air ? It is curious enough . A good many years ago , Mr. James Miller , writer in your good town , a gentleman whom possibly you know , was in company with our friend Clarke ; and talking of Scottish music , Miller expressed an ardent ambition to be able to compose a Scots air . Mr. Clarke , partly by way of joke , told him to keep to the black keys of the harpsichord , and preserve some kind of rhythm , and he would infallibly compose a Scots air . Certain it is that , in a few days , Mr. Miller produced the rudiments of an air , which Mr. Clarke , with some touches and corrections , fashioned into the tune in question . Ritson , you know , has the same story of the black keys ; but this account which I have just given you , Mr. Clarke informed me of several years ago . Now , to show you how difficult it is to trace the origin of our airs , I have heard it repeatedly asserted that this was an Irish air ; nay , I met with an Irish gentleman who affirmed he had heard it in Ireland among the old women ; while , on the other hand , a countess informed me , that the first person who introduced the air into this country , was a baronet 's lady of her acquaintance , who took down the notes from an itinerant piper in the Isle of Man . How difficult , then , to ascertain the truth respecting our poesy and music ! I , myself , have lately seen a couple of ballads sung through the streets of Dumfries , with my name at the head of them as the author , though it was the first time I had ever seen them .</p>
   <p>I thank you for admitting “ Craigieburn-wood ; ” and I shall take care to furnish you with a new chorus . In fact , the chorus was not my work , but a part of some old verses to the air . If I can catch myself in a more than ordinarily propitious moment , I shall write a new “ Craigieburn-wood ” altogether . My heart is much in the theme .</p>
   <p>I am ashamed , my dear fellow , to make the request ; ‘ tis dunning your generosity ; but in a moment when I had forgotten whether I was rich or poor , I promised Chloris a copy of your songs . It wrings my honest pride to write you this ; but an ungracious request is doubly so by a tedious apology . To make you some amends , as soon as I have extracted the necessary information out of them , I will return you Ritson 's volumes .</p>
   <p>The lady is not a little proud that she is to make so distinguished a figure in your collection , and I am not a little proud that I have it in my power to please her so much . Lucky it is for your patience that my paper is done , for when I am in a scribbling humour , I know not when to give over .</p>

     <l n="1">19th November , 1794 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>You see , my dear Sir , what a punctual correspondent I am ; though , indeed , you may thank yourself for the tedium of my letters , as you have so flattered me on my horsemanship with my favourite hobby , and have praised the grace of his ambling so much , that I am scarcely ever off his back . For instance , this morning , though a keen blowing frost , in my walk before breakfast , I finished my duet , which you were pleased to praise so much . Whether I have uniformly succeeded , I will not say ; but here it is for you , though it is not an hour old .</p>
   <p>O Philly , happy be the day .<span corresp="#note271" type="note_anchor">[ 271 ]</span></p>
   <p>Tell me honestly how you like it , and point out whatever you think faulty .</p>
   <p>I am much pleased with your idea of singing our songs in alternate stanzas , and regret that you did not hint it to me sooner . In those that remain , I shall have it in my eye . I remember your objections to the name Philly , but it is the common abbreviation of Phillis . Sally , the only other name that suits , has to my ear a vulgarity about it , which unfits it , for anything except burlesque . The legion of Scottish poetasters of the day , whom your brother editor , Mr. Ritson , ranks with me as my coevals , have always mistaken vulgarity for simplicity ; whereas , simplicity is as much eloignée from vulgarity on the one hand , as from affected point and puerile conceit on the other .</p>
   <p>I agree with you as to the air , “ Craigieburn-wood , ” that a chorus would , in some degree , spoil the effect , and shall certainly have none in my projected song to it . It is not , however , a case in point with “ Rothemurche ; ” there , as in “ Roy 's Wife of Aldivalloch , ” a chorus goes , to my taste , well enough . As to the chorus going first , that is the case with “ Roy 's Wife , ” as well as “ Rothemurche . ” In fact , in the first part of both tunes , the rhythm is so peculiar and irregular , and on that irregularity depends so much of their beauty , that we must e'en take them with all their wildness , and humour the verse accordingly . Leaving out the starting note in both tunes , has , I think , an effect that no regularity could counterbalance the want of .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Does not the lameness of the prefixed syllable strike you ? In the last case , with the true furor of genius , you strike at once into the wild originality of the air ; whereas , in the first insipid method , it is like the grating screw of the pins before the fiddle is brought into tune . This is my taste ; if I am wrong , I beg pardon of the cognoscenti .</p>
   <p>“ The Caledonian Hunt ” is so charming , that it would make any subject in a song go down ; but pathos is certainly its native tongue . Scottish bacchanalians we certainly want , though the few we have are excellent . For instance , “ Todlin hame , ” is , for wit and humour , an unparalleled composition ; And “ Andrew and his cutty gun ” is the work of a master . By the way , are you not quite vexed to think that those men of genius , for such they certainly were , who composed our fine Scottish lyrics , should be unknown ? It has given me many a heart-ache . Apropos to bacchanalian songs in Scottish , I composed one yesterday , for an air I like much — “ Lumps o ’ pudding . ”</p>

   <note>The instrument which the poet got from the braes of Athol , seems of an order as rude and incapable of fine sounds as the whistles which school-boys make in spring from the smaller boughs of the plane-tree .</note>
   <p>Since yesterday 's penmanship , I have framed a couple of English stanzas , by way of an English song to “ Roy 's Wife . ” You will allow me , that in this instance my English corresponds in sentiment with the Scottish .</p>
   <p>Canst thou leave me thus , my Katy ?<span corresp="#note273" type="note_anchor">[ 273 ]</span></p>
   <p>Well ! I think this , to be done in two or three turns across my room , and with two or three pinches of Irish blackguard , is not so far amiss . You see I am determined to have my quantum of applause from somebody .</p>
   <p>Tell my friend Allan ( for I am sure that we only want the trifling circumstance of being known to one another , to be the best friends on earth ) that I much suspect he has , in his plates , mistaken the figure of the stock and horn . I have , at last , gotten one , but it is a very rude instrument . It is comprised of three parts ; the stock , which is the hinder thigh bone of a sheep , such as you see in a mutton ham ; the horn , which is a common Highland cow 's horn , cut off at the smaller end , until the aperture be large enough to admit the stock to be pushed up through the horn until it be held by the thicker end of the thigh-bone ; and lastly , an oaten reed exactly cut and notched like that which you see every shepherd boy have , when the corn-stems are green and full grown . The reed is not made fast in the bone , but is held by the lips , and plays loose in the smaller end of the stock ; while the stock , with the horn hanging on its larger end , is held by the hands in playing . The stock has six or seven ventages on the upper side , and one back-ventage , like the common flute . This of mine was made by a man from the braes of Athole , and is exactly what the shepherds wont to use in that country .</p>
   <p>However , either it is not quite properly bored in the holes , or else we have not the art of blowing it rightly ; for we can make little of it . If Mr. Allan chooses , I will send him a sight of mine , as I look on myself to be a kind of brother-brush with him . “ Pride in poets is nae sin ; ” and I will say it , that I look on Mr. Allan and Mr. Burns to be the only genuine and real painters of Scottish costume in the world .</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>Your offer is indeed truly generous , and most sincerely do I thank you for it ; but in my present situation , I find that I dare not accept it . You well know my political sentiments ; and were I an insular individual , unconnected with a wife and a family of children , with the most fervid enthusiasm I would have volunteered my services : I then could and would have despised all consequences that might have ensued .</p>
   <p>My prospect in the Excise is something ; at least it is , encumbered as I am with the welfare , the very existence , of near half-a-score of helpless individuals , what I dare not sport with .</p>
   <p>In the mean time , they are most welcome to my Ode ; only , let them insert it as a thing they have met with by accident and unknown to me .— Nay , if Mr. Perry , whose honour , after your character of him , I cannot doubt ; if he will give me an address and channel by which anything will come safe from those spies with which he may be certain that his correspondence is beset , I will now and then send him any bagatelle that I may write . In the present hurry of Europe , nothing but news and politics will be regarded ; but against the days of peace , which Heaven send soon , my little assistance may perhaps fill up an idle column of a newspaper . I have long had it in my head to try my hand in the way of little prose essays , which I propose sending into the world though the medium of some newspaper ; and should these be worth his while , to these Mr. Perry shall be welcome ; and all my reward shall be , his treating me with his paper , which , by the bye , to anybody who has the least relish for wit , is a high treat indeed .</p>

   <p>DEAR SIR ,</p>
   <p>I was , I know , drunk last night , but I am sober this morning . From the expressions Capt . —— made use of to me , had I had no-body 's welfare to care for but my own , we should certainly have come , according to the manners of the world , to the necessity of murdering one another about the business . The words were such as , generally , I believe , end in a brace of pistols ; but I am still pleased to think that I did not ruin the peace and welfare of a wife and a family of children in a drunken squabble . Farther , you know that the report of certain political opinions being mine , has already once before brought me to the brink of destruction . I dread lest last night 's business may be misrepresented in the same way .— You , I beg , will take care to prevent it . I tax your wish for Mr. Burns ’ welfare with the task of waiting as soon as possible , on every gentleman who was present , and state this to him , and , as you please , show him this letter . What , after all , was the obnoxious toast ? “ May our success in the present war be equal to the justice of our cause . ” — A toast that the most outrageous frenzy of loyalty cannot object to . I request and beg that this morning you will wait on the parties present at the foolish dispute . I shall only add , that I am truly sorry that a man who stood so high in my estimation as Mr. ——, should use me in the manner in which I conceive he has done .</p>

   <p>I fear for my songs ; however , a few may please , yet originality is a coy feature in composition , and in a multiplicity of efforts in the same style , disappears altogether .

    <head>MY DEAR THOMSON ,</head>
    <head>You cannot have any idea of the predicament in which I write to you . In the course of my duty as supervisor ( in which capacity I have acted of late ) , I came yesternight to this unfortunate , wicked little village . I have gone forward , but snows of ten feet deep have impeded my progress : I have tried to “ gae back the gate I cam again , ” but the same obstacle has shut me up within insuperable bars . To add to my misfortune , since dinner , a scraper has been torturing catgut , in sounds that would have insulted the dying agonies of a sow under the hands of a butcher , and thinks himself , on that very account , exceeding good company . In fact , I have been in a dilemma , either to get drunk , to forget these miseries ; or to hang myself , to get rid of them : like a prudent man ( a character congenial to my every thought , word , and deed ) , I of two evils have chosen the least , and am very drunk , at your service !</head>
     <l n="1">I wrote you yesterday from Dumfries . I had not time then to tell you</l>
     <l n="2">all I wanted to say ; and , Heaven knows , at present have not capacity .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Do you know an air — I am sure you must know it — “ We 'll gang nae mair to yon town ? ” I think , in slowish time , it would make an excellent song . I am highly delighted with it ; and if you should think it worthy of your attention , I have a fair dame in my eye to whom I would consecrate it .</p>
   <p>As I am just going to bed , I wish you a good night .</p>

   <p>Well , this is not amiss . You see how I answer your orders — your tailor could not be more punctual . I am just now in a high fit for poetizing , provided that the strait-jacket of criticism do n't cure me . If you can , in a post or two , administer a little of the intoxicating potion of your applause , it will raise your humble servant 's phrensy to any height you want .

   <p>Ten thousand thanks for your elegant present — though I am ashamed of the value of it , being bestowed on a man who has not , by any means , merited such an instance of kindness . I have shown it to two or three judges of the first abilities here , and they all agree with me in classing it as a first-rate production . My phiz is sae kenspeckle , that the very joiner 's apprentice , whom Mrs. Burns employed to break up the parcel ( I was out of town that day ) knew it at once . My most grateful compliments to Allan , who has honoured my rustic music so much with his masterly pencil . One strange coincidence is , that the little one who is making the felonious attempt on the cat 's tail , is the most striking likeness of an ill-deedie , d — n 'd , wee , rumblegairie urchin of mine , whom from that propensity to witty wickedness , and man-fu ’ mischief , which , even at twa days auld , I foresaw would form the striking features of his disposition , I named Willie Nicol , after a certain friend of mine , who is one of the masters of a grammar-school in a city which shall be nameless .</p>

   <p>Do you know that you have roused the torpidity of Clarke at last ? He has requested me to write three or four songs for him , which he is to set to music himself . The enclosed sheet contains two songs for him , which please to present to my valued friend Cunningham .</p>
   <p>I enclose the sheet open , both for your inspection , and that you may copy the song “ Oh bonnie was yon rosy brier . ” I do not know whether I am right , but that song pleases me ; and as it is extremely probable that Clarke 's newly-roused celestial spark will be soon smothered in the fogs of indolence , if you like the song , it may go as Scottish verses to the air of “ I wish my love was in a mire ; ” and poor Erskine 's English lines may follow .</p>
   <p>I enclose you a “ For a ’ that and a ’ that , ” which was never in print : it is a much superior song to mine . I have been told that it was composed by a lady , and some lines written on the blank leaf of a copy of the last edition of my poems , presented to the lady whom , in so many fictitious reveries of passion , but with the most ardent sentiments of real friendship , I have so often sung under the name of Chloris :—</p>

    <head>MADAM ,</head>
    <head>I dare say that this is the first epistle you ever received from this nether world . I write you from the regions of Hell , amid the horrors of the damned . The time and the manner of my leaving your earth I do not exactly know , as I took my departure in the heat of a fever of intoxication contracted at your too hospitable mansion ; but , on my arrival here , I was fairly tried , and sentenced to endure the purgatorial tortures of this infernal confine for the space of ninety-nine years , eleven months , and twenty-nine days , and all on account of the impropriety of my conduct yesternight under your roof . Here am I , laid on a bed of pitiless furze , with my aching head reclined on a pillow of ever-piercing thorn , while an infernal tormentor , wrinkled , and old , and cruel , his name I think is Recollection , with a whip of scorpions , forbids peace or rest to approach me , and keeps anguish eternally awake . Still , Madam , if I could in any measure be reinstated in the good opinion of the fair circle whom my conduct last night so much injured , I think it would be an alleviation to my torments . For this reason I trouble you with this letter . To the men of the company I will make no apology .— Your husband , who insisted on my drinking more than I chose , has no right to blame me ; and the other gentlemen were partakers of my guilt . But to you , Madam , I have much to apologize . Your good opinion I valued as one of the greatest acquisitions I had made on earth , and I was truly a beast to forfeit it . There was a Miss I ——, too , a woman of fine sense , gentle and unassuming manners — do make on my part , a miserable d — mned wretch 's best apology to her . A Mrs. G ——, a charming woman , did me the honour to be prejudiced in my favour ; this makes me hope that I have not outraged her beyond all forgiveness .— To all the other ladies please present my humblest contrition for my conduct , and my petition for their gracious pardon . O all ye powers of decency and decorum ! whisper to them that my errors , though great , were involuntary — that an intoxicated man is the vilest of beasts — that it was not in my nature to be brutal to any one — that to be rude to a woman , when in my senses , was impossible with me — but —</head>

When “ Anacharsis ’ Travels ” come to hand , which Mrs. Riddel mentioned as her gift to the public library , Mr. B. will thank her for a reading of it previous to her sending it to the library , as it is a book Mr. B. has never seen : he wishes to have a longer perusal of them than the regulations of the library allow .</p>

   <p>In such a bad world as ours , those who add to the scanty sum of our pleasures , are positively our benefactors . To you , Madam , on our humble Dumfries boards , I have been more indebted for entertainment than ever I was in prouder theatres . Your charms as a woman would insure applause to the most indifferent actress , and your theatrical talents would insure admiration to the plainest figure . This , Madam , is not the unmeaning or insidious compliment of the frivolous or interested ; I pay it from the same honest impulse that the sublime of nature excites my admiration , or her beauties give me delight .</p>
   <p>Will the foregoing lines be of any service to you in your approaching benefit-night ? If they will I shall be prouder of my muse than ever . They are nearly extempore : I know they have no great merit ; but though they should add but little to the entertainment of the evening , they give me the happiness of an opportunity to declare how much I have the honour to be , &amp; c .</p>

    <head>As I am in a complete Decemberish humour , gloomy , sullen , stupid as even the Deity of Dulness herself could wish , I shall not drawl out a heavy letter with a number of heavier apologies for my late silence . Only one I shall mention , because I know you will sympathize in it : these four months , a sweet little girl , my youngest child , has been so ill , that every day , a week or less , threatened to terminate her existence . There had much need be many pleasures annexed to the states of husband and father , for , God knows , they have many peculiar cares . I cannot describe to you the anxious , sleepless hours these ties frequently give me . I see a train of helpless little folks ; me and my exertions all their stay : and on what a brittle thread does the life of man hang !

   <p>This , my much-loved friend , is a morning of wishes — accept mine — so heaven hear me as they are sincere ! that blessings may attend your steps , and affliction know you not ! In the charming words of my favourite author , “ The Man of Feeling , ” “ May the Great Spirit bear up the weight of thy gray hairs , and blunt the arrow that brings them rest ! ”</p>
   <p>Now that I talk of authors , how do you like Cowper ? Is not the “ Task ” a glorious poem ? The religion of the “ Task , ” bating a few scraps of Calvinistic divinity , is the religion of God and nature ; the religion that exalts , that ennobles man . Were not you to send me your “ Zeluco , ” in return for mine ? Tell me how you like my marks and notes through the book . I would not give a farthing for a book , unless I were at liberty to blot it with my criticisms .</p>
   <p>I have lately collected , for a friend 's perusal , all my letters ; I mean those which I first sketched , in a rough draught , and afterwards wrote out fair . On looking over some old musty papers , which , from time to time , I had parcelled by , as trash that were scarce worth preserving , and which yet at the same time I did not care to destroy ; I discovered many of these rude sketches , and have written , and am writing them out , in a bound MS. for my friend 's library . As I wrote always to you the rhapsody of the moment , I cannot find a single scroll to you , except one about the commencement of our acquaintance . If there were any possible conveyance , I would send you a perusal of my book .</p>

   <p>SIR ,</p>
   <p>Enclosed are the two schemes . I would not have troubled you with the collector 's one , but for suspicion lest it be not right . Mr. Erskine promised me to make it right , if you will have the goodness to show him how . As I have no copy of the scheme for myself , and the alterations being very considerable from what it was formerly , I hope that I shall have access to this scheme I send you , when I come to face up my new books . So much for schemes .— And that no scheme to betray a FRIEND , or mislead a STRANGER ; to seduce a YOUNG GIRL , or rob a HEN-ROOST ; to subvert LIBERTY , or bribe an EXCISEMAN ; to disturb the GENERAL ASSEMBLY , or annoy a GOSSIPPING ; to overthrow the credit of ORTHODOXY , or the authority of OLD SONGS ; to oppose your wishes , or frustrate my hopes — MAY PROSPER — is the sincere wish and prayer of</p>

To be deprived of any one number of the first newspaper in Great Britain for information , ability , and independence , is what I can ill brook and bear ; but to be deprived of that most admirable oration of the Marquis of Lansdowne , when he made the great though ineffectual attempt ( in the language of the poet , I fear too true ) , “ to save a SINKING STATE ” — this was a loss that I neither can nor will forgive you .— That paper , Sir , never reached me ; but I demand it of you . I am a BRITON ; and must be interested in the cause of LIBERTY :— I am a MAN ; and the RIGHTS of HUMAN NATURE cannot be indifferent to me . However , do not let me mislead you : I am not a man in that situation of life , which , as your subscriber , can be of any consequence to you , in the eyes of those to whom SITUATION OF LIFE ALONE is the criterion of MAN .— I am but a plain tradesman , in this distant , obscure country town : but that humble domicile in which I shelter my wife and children is the CASTELLUM of a BRITON ; and that scanty , hard-earned income which supports them is as truly my property , as the most magnificent fortune , of the most PUISSANT MEMBER of your HOUSE of NOBLES .</p>
   <p>These , Sir , are my sentiments ; and to them I subscribe my name : and were I a man of ability and consequence enough to address the PUBLIC , with that name should they appear .</p>

   <note>notes on the Ballads which bear his name . ] Dumfries , 1794 , or 1795 . SIR , I enclose you some copies of a couple of political ballads ; one of which , I believe , you have never seen . Would to Heaven I could make you master of as many votes in the Stewartry — but — “ Who does the utmost that he can , Does well , acts nobly , angels could no more . ” In order to bring my humble efforts to bear with more effect on the foe , I have privately printed a good many copies of both ballads , and have sent them among friends all about the country . To pillory on Parnassus the rank reprobation of character , the utter dereliction of all principle , in a profligate junto which has not only outraged virtue , but violated common decency ; which , spurning even hypocrisy as paltry iniquity below their daring ;— to unmask their flagitiousness to the broadest day — to deliver such over to their merited fate , is surely not merely innocent , but laudable ; is not only propriety , but virtue . You have already , as your auxiliary , the sober detestation of mankind on the heads or your opponents ; and I swear by the lyre of Thalia to muster on your side all the votaries of honest laughter , and fair , candid ridicule ! I am extremely obliged to you for your kind mention of my interests in a letter which Mr. Syme showed me . At present my situation in life must be in a great measure stationary , at least for two or three years . The statement is this — I am on the supervisors ’ list , and as we come on there by precedency , in two or three years I shall be at the head of that list , and be appointed of course . Then , a FRIEND might be of service to me in getting me into a place of the kingdom which I would like . A supervisor 's income varies from about a hundred and twenty to two hundred a year ; but the business is an incessant drudgery , and would be nearly a complete bar to every species of literary pursuit . The moment I am appointed supervisor , in the common routine , I may be nominated on the collector 's list ; and this is always a business purely of political patronage . A collector-ship varies much , from better than two hundred a year to near a thousand . They also come forward by precedency on the list ; and have , besides a handsome income , a life of complete leisure . A life of literary leisure with a decent competency , is the summit of my wishes . It would be the prudish affectation of silly pride in me to say that I do not need , or would not be indebted to a political friend ; at the same time , Sir , I by no means lay my affairs before you thus , to hook my dependent situation on your benevolence . If , in my progress of life , an opening should occur where the good offices of a gentleman of your public character and political consequence might bring me forward , I shall petition your goodness with the same frankness as I now do myself the honour to subscribe myself R.

    <p>TO MRS. DUNLOP , IN LONDON . [ In the correspondence of the poet with Mrs. Dunlop he rarely mentions Thomson 's Collection of Songs , though his heart was set much upon it : in the Dunlop library there are many letters from the poet , it is said , which have not been published . ] Dumfries , 20th December , 1795 . I have been prodigiously disappointed in this London journey of yours . In the first place , when your last to me reached Dumfries , I was in the country , and did not return until too late to answer your letter ; in the next place , I thought you would certainly take this route ; and now I know not what is become of you , or whether this may reach you at all . God grant that it may find you and yours in prospering health and good spirits ! Do let me hear from you the soonest possible . As I hope to get a frank from my friend Captain Miller , I shall every leisure hour , take up the pen , and gossip away whatever comes first , prose or poetry , sermon or song . In this last article I have abounded of late . I have often mentioned to you a superb publication of Scottish songs which is making its appearance in your great metropolis , and where I have the honour to preside over the Scottish verse , as no less a personage than Peter Pindar does over the English . December 29th . Since I began this letter , I have been appointed to act in the capacity of supervisor here , and I assure you , what with the load of business , and what with that business being new to me , I could scarcely have commanded ten minutes to have spoken to you , had you been in town , much less to have written you an epistle . This appointment is only temporary , and during the illness of the present incumbent ; but I look forward to an early period when I shall be appointed in full form : a consummation devoutly to be wished ! My political sins seem to be forgiven me . This is the season ( New-year'shYpppHeNday is now my date ) of wishing ; and mine are most fervently offered up for you ! May life to you be a positive blessing while it lasts , for your own sake ; and that it may yet be greatly prolonged , is my wish for my own sake , and for the sake of the rest of your friends ! What a transient business is life ! Very lately I was a boy ; but t'other day I was a young man ; and I already begin to feel the rigid fibre and stiffening joints of old age coming fast o'er my frame . With all my follies of youth , and I fear , a few vices of manhood , still I congratulate myself on having had in early days religion strongly impressed on my mind . I have nothing to say to any one as to which sect he belongs to , or what creed he believes : but I look on the man , who is firmly persuaded of infinite wisdom and goodness , superintending and directing every circumstance that can happen in his lot — I felicitate such a man as having a solid foundation for his mental enjoyment ; a firm prop and sure stay , in the hour of difficulty , trouble , and distress ; and a never-failing anchor of hope , when he looks beyond the grave . January 12th . You will have seen our worthy and ingenious friend , the Doctor , long ere this . I hope he is well , and beg to be remembered to him . I have just been reading over again , I dare say for the hundred and fiftieth time , his View of Society and Manners ; and still I read it with delight . His humour is perfectly original — it is neither the humour of Addison , nor Swift , nor Sterne , nor of anybody but Dr. Moore . By the bye , you have deprived me of Zeluco , remember that , when you are disposed to rake up the sins of my neglect from among the ashes of my laziness . He has paid me a pretty compliment , by quoting me in his last publication .<span type="note_anchor">[ 287 ]</span>R. B. FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 287 : Edward . ] CCCXXVI . ADDRESS OF THE SCOTCH DISTILLERS TO THE RIGHT HON . WILLIAM PITT . [ This ironical letter to the prime minister was found among the papers of Burns . ] SIR , While pursy burgesses crowd your gate , sweating under the weight of heavy addresses , permit us , the quondam distillers in that part of Great Britain called Scotland , to approach you , not with venal approbation , but with fraternal condolence ; not as what you are just now , or for some time have been ; but as what , in all probability , you will shortly be .— We shall have the merit of not deserting our friends in the day of their calamity , and you will have the satisfaction of perusing at least one honest address . You are well acquainted with the dissection of human nature ; nor do you need the assistance of a fellow-creature 's bosom to inform you , that man is always a selfish , often a perfidious being .— This assertion , however the hasty conclusions of superficial observation may doubt of it , or the raw inexperience of youth may deny it , those who make the fatal experiment we have done , will feel .— You are a statesman , and consequently are not ignorant of the traffic of these corporation compliments — The little great man who drives the borough to market , and the very great man who buys the borough in that market , they two do the whole business ; and you well know they , likewise , have their price . With that sullen disdain which you can so well assume , rise , illustrious Sir , and spurn these hireling efforts of venal stupidity . At best they are the compliments of a man 's friends on the morning of his execution : they take a decent farewell , resign you to your fate , and hurry away from your approaching hour . If fame say true , and omens be not very much mistaken , you are about to make your exit from that world where the sun of gladness gilds the paths of prosperous man : permit us , great Sir , with the sympathy of fellow-feeling to hail your passage to the realms of ruin . Whether the sentiment proceed from the selfishness or cowardice of mankind is immaterial ; but to point out to a child of misfortune those who are still more unhappy , is to give him some degree of positive enjoyment . In this light , Sir , our downfall may be again useful to you :— though not exactly in the same way , it is not perhaps the first time it has gratified your feelings . It is true , the triumph of your evil star is exceedingly despiteful .— At an age when others are the votaries of pleasure , or underlings in business , you had attained the highest wish of a British statesman ; and with the ordinary date of human life , what a prospect was before you ! Deeply rooted in Royal favour , you overshadowed the land . The birds of passage , which follow ministerial sunshine through every clime of political faith and manners , flocked to your branches ; and the beasts of the field ( the lordly possessors of hills and valleys ) crowded under your shade . “ But behold a watcher , a holy one , came down from heaven , and cried aloud , and said thus : Hew down the tree , and cut off his branches ; shake off his leaves , and scatter his fruit ; let the beasts get away from under it , and the fowls from his branches ! ” A blow from an unthought-of quarter , one of those terrible accidents which peculiarly mark the hand of Omnipotence , overset your career , and laid all your fancied honours in the dust . But turn your eyes , Sir , to the tragic scenes of our fate :— an ancient nation , that for many ages had gallantly maintained the unequal struggle for independence with her much more powerful neighbour , at last agrees to a union which should ever after make them one people . In consideration of certain circumstances , it was covenanted that the former should enjoy a stipulated alleviation in her share of the public burdens , particularly in that branch of the revenue called the Excise . This just privilege has of late given great umbrage to some interested , powerful individuals of the more potent part of the empire , and they have spared no wicked pains , under insidious pretexts , to subvert what they dared not openly to attack , from the dread which they yet entertained of the spirit of their ancient enemies . In this conspiracy we fell ; nor did we alone suffer , our country was deeply wounded . A number of ( we will say ) respectable individuals , largely engaged in trade , where we were not only useful , but absolutely necessary to our country in her dearest interests ; we , with all that was near and dear to us , were sacrificed without remorse , to the infernal deity of political expediency ! We fell to gratify the wishes of dark envy , and the views of unprincipled ambition ! Your foes , Sir , were avowed ; were too brave to take an ungenerous advantage ; you fell in the face of day .— On the contrary , our enemies , to complete our overthrow , contrived to make their guilt appear the villany of a nation .— Your downfall only drags with you your private friends and partisans : in our misery are more or less involved the most numerous and most valuable part of the community — all those who immediately depend on the cultivation of the soil , from the landlord of a province , down to his lowest hind . Allow us , Sir , yet further , just to hint at another rich vein of comfort in the dreary regions of adversity ;— the gratulations of an approving conscience . In a certain great assembly , of which you are a distinguished member , panegyrics on your private virtues have so often wounded your delicacy , that we shall not distress you with anything on the subject . There is , however , one part of your public conduct which our feelings will not permit us to pass in silence : our gratitude must trespass on your modesty ; we mean , worthy Sir , your whole behaviour to the Scots Distillers .— In evil hours , when obtrusive recollection presses bitterly on the sense , let that , Sir , come like an healing angel , and speak the peace to your soul which the world can neither give nor take away . We have the honour to be , Sir , Your sympathizing fellow-sufferers , And grateful humble servants , JOHN BARLEYCORN — Præses . CCCXXVII . TO THE HON . PROVOST , BAILIES , AND TOWN COUNCIL OF DUMFRIES . [ The Provost and Bailies complied at once with the modest request of the poet : both Jackson and Staig , who were heads of the town by turns , were men of taste and feeling . ] GENTLEMEN , The literary taste and liberal spirit of your good town has so ably filled the various departments of your schools , as to make it a very great object for a parent to have his children educated in them . Still , to me , a stranger , with my large family , and very stinted income , to give my young ones that education I wish , at the high fees which a stranger pays , will bear hard upon me . Some years ago your good town did me the honour of making me an honorary burgess .— Will you allow me to request that this mark of distinction may extend so far , as to put me on a footing of a real freeman of the town , in the schools ? If you are so very kind as to grant my request , it will certainly be a constant incentive to me to strain every nerve where I can officially serve you ; and will , if possible , increase that grateful respect with which I have the honour to be , Gentlemen , Your devoted humble servant , R. B. CCCXXVIII . TO MRS. RIDDEL . [ Mrs. Riddel was , like Burns , a well-wisher to the great cause of human liberty , and lamented with him the excesses of the French Revolution . ] Dumfries , 20th January , 1796 . I cannot express my gratitude to you , for allowing me a longer perusal of “ Anacharsis . ” In fact , I never met with a book that bewitched me so much ; and I , as a member of the library , must warmly feel the obligation you have laid us under . Indeed to me the obligation is stronger than to any other individual of our society ; as “ Anacharsis ” is an indispensable desideratum to a son of the muses . The health you wished me in your morning 's card , is , I think , flown from me for ever . I have not been able to leave my bed to-day till about an hour ago . These wickedly unlucky advertisements I lent ( I did wrong ) to a friend , and I am ill able to go in quest of him . The muses have not quite forsaken me . The following detached stanza I intend to interweave in some disastrous tale of a shepherd . R. B. CCCXXIX . TO MRS. DUNLOP . [ It seems that Mrs. Dunlop regarded the conduct of Burns , for some months , with displeasure , and withheld or delayed her usual kind and charming communications . ] Dumfries , 31st January , 1796 . These many months you have been two packets in my debt — what sin of ignorance I have committed against so highly-valued a friend I am utterly at a loss to guess . Alas ! Madam , ill can I afford , at this time , to be deprived of any of the small remnant of my pleasures . I have lately drunk deep in the cup of affliction . The autumn robbed me of my only daughter and darling child , and that at a distance too , and so rapidly , as to put it out of my power to pay the last duties to her . I had scarcely begun to recover from that shock , when I became myself the victim of a most severe rheumatic fever , and long the die spun doubtful ; until , after many weeks of a sick bed , it seems to have turned up life , and I am beginning to crawl across my room , and once indeed have been before my own door in the street . “ When pleasure fascinates the mental sight , Affliction purifies the visual ray , Religion hails the drear , the untried night , And shuts , for ever shuts ! life 's doubtful day . ” R. B. CCCXXX . TO MR. THOMSON . [ Cromek informed me , on the authority of Mrs. Burns , that the “ handsome , elegant present ” mentioned in this letter , was a common worsted shawl . ] February , 1796 . Many thanks , my dear Sir , for your handsome , elegant present to Mrs. Burns , and for my remaining volume of P. Pindar . Peter is a delightful fellow , and a first favourite of mine . I am much pleased with your idea of publishing a collection of our songs in octavo , with etchings . I am extremely willing to lend every assistance in my power . The Irish airs I shall cheerfully undertake the task of finding verses for . I have already , you know , equipt three with words , and the other day I strung up a kind of rhapsody to another Hibernian melody , which I admire much . Awa ’ wi ’ your witchcraft o ’ beauty 's alarms .<span type="note_anchor">[ 288 ]</span>If this will do , you have now four of my Irish engagement . In my by-past songs I dislike one thing , the name Chloris — I meant it as the fictitious name of a certain lady : but , on second thoughts , it is a high incongruity to have a Greek appellation to a Scottish pastoral ballad . Of this , and some things else , in my next : I have more amendments to propose . What you once mentioned of “ flaxen locks ” is just : they cannot enter into an elegant description of beauty . Of this also again — God bless you !<span type="note_anchor">[ 289 ]</span>R. B. FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 288 : Song CCLXVI . ] [ Footnote 289 : Our poet never explained what name he would have substituted for Chloris .— Mr . Thomson . ] CCCXXXI . TO MR. THOMSON . [ It is seldom that painting speaks in the spirit of poetry Burns perceived some of the blemishes of Allan 's illustrations : but at that time little nature and less elegance entered into the embellishments of books . ] April , 1796 . Alas ! my dear Thomson , I fear it will be some time ere I tune my lyre again ! “ By Babel streams I have sat and wept ” almost ever since I wrote you last ; I have only known existence by the pressure of the heavy hand of sickness , and have counted time by the repercussions of pain ! Rheumatism , cold , and fever have formed to me a terrible combination . I close my eyes in misery , and open them without hope . I look on the vernal day , and say with poor Fergusson , “ Say , wherefore has an all-indulgent heaven Light to the comfortless and wretched given ? ” This will be delivered to you by Mrs. Hyslop , landlady of the Globe Tavern here , which for these many years has been my howff , and where our friend Clarke and I have had many a merry squeeze . I am highly delighted with Mr. Allan 's etchings . “ Woo 'd an ’ married an ’ a ’ , ” is admirable ! The grouping is beyond all praise . The expression of the figures , conformable to the story in the ballad , is absolutely faultless perfection . I next admire “ Turnim-spike . ” What I like least is “ Jenny said to Jockey . ” Besides the female being in her appearance * * * *, if you take her stooping into the account , she is at least two inches taller than her lover . Poor Cleghorn ! I sincerely sympathize with him . Happy I am to think that he yet has a well-grounded hope of health and enjoyment in this world . As for me — but that is a sad subject . R. B. CCCXXXII . TO MR. THOMSON . [ The genius of the poet triumphed over pain and want ,— his last songs are as tender and as true as any of his early compositions . ] MY DEAR SIR , I once mentioned to you an air which I have long admired — “ Here 's a health to them that 's awa , hiney , ” but I forget if you took any notice of it . I have just been trying to suit it with verses , and I beg leave to recommend the air to your attention once more . I have only begun it . [ Here follow the first three stanzas of the song , beginning , Here 's a health to ane I loe dear ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 290 ]</span>the fourth was found among the poet 's MSS . after his death . ] R. B. FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 290 : Song CCLXVII . ] CCCXXXIII . TO MR. THOMSON . [ John Lewars , whom the poet introduces to Thomson , was a brother gauger , and a kind , warm-hearted gentleman ; Jessie Lewars was his sister , and at this time but in her teens . ] This will be delivered by Mr. Lewars , a young fellow of uncommon merit . As he will be a day or two in town , you will have leisure , if you choose , to write me by him : and if you have a spare half-hour to spend with him , I shall place your kindness to my account . I have no copies of the songs I have sent you , and I have taken a fancy to review them all , and possibly may mend some of them ; so when you have complete leisure , I will thank you for either the originals or copies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 291 ]</span>I had rather be the author of five well-written songs than of ten otherwise . I have great hopes that the genial influence of the approaching summer will set me to rights , but as yet I cannot boast of returning health . I have now reason to believe that my complaint is a flying gout — a sad business ! Do let me know how Cleghorn is , and remember me to him . This should have been delivered to you a month ago . I am still very poorly , but should like much to hear from you . R. B. FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 291 : “ It is needless to say that this revisal Burns did not live to perform . ” — Currie . ] CCCXXXIV . TO MRS. RIDDEL , Who had desired him to go to the Birth-Day Assembly on that day to show his loyalty . [ This is the last letter which the poet wrote to this accomplished lady . ] Dumfries , 4th June , 1796 . I am in such miserable health as to be utterly incapable of showing my loyalty in any way . Rackt as I am with rheumatisms , I meet every face with a greeting like that of Balak to Balaam — “ Come , curse me Jacob ; and come , defy me Israel ! ” So say I — Come , curse me that east wind ; and come , defy me the north ! Would you have me in such circumstances copy you out a love-song ? I may perhaps see you on Saturday , but I will not be at the ball .— Why should I ? “ man delights not me , nor woman either ! ” Can you supply me with the song , “ Let us all be unhappy together ? ” — do if you can , and oblige , le pauvre miserable R. B. CCCXXXV . TO MR. CLARKE , SCHOOLMASTER , FORFAR . [ Who will say , after reading the following distressing letter , lately come to light , that Burns did not die in great poverty . ] Dumfries , 26th June , 1796 . MY DEAR CLARKE , Still , still the victim of affliction ! Were you to see the emaciated figure who now holds the pen to you , you would not know your old friend . Whether I shall ever get about again , is only known to Him , the Great Unknown , whose creature I am . Alas , Clarke ! I begin to fear the worst . As to my individual self , I am tranquil , and would despise myself , if I were not ; but Burns 's poor widow , and half-a-dozen of his dear little ones — helpless orphans !— there I am weak as a woman 's tear . Enough of this ! ‘ Tis half of my disease . I duly received your last , enclosing the note . It came extremely in time , and I am much obliged by your punctuality . Again I must request you to do me the same kindness . Be so very good , as , by return of post , to enclose me another note . I trust you can do it without inconvenience , and it will seriously oblige me . If I must go , I shall leave a few friends behind me , whom I shall regret while consciousness remains . I know I shall live in their remembrance . Adieu , dear Clarke . That I shall ever see you again , is , I am afraid , highly improbable . R. B. CCCXXXVI . TO MR. JAMES JOHNSON , EDINBURGH . [ “ In this humble and delicate manner did poor Burns ask for a copy of a work of which he was principally the founder , and to which he had contributed gratuitously not less than one hundred and eighty-four original , altered , and collected songs ! The editor has seen one hundred and eighty transcribed by his own hand , for the ‘ Museum . ’ ” — CROMEK . Will it be believed that this “ humble request ” of Burns was not complied with ! The work was intended as a present to Jessie Lewars . ] Dumfries , 4th July , 1796 . How are you , my dear friend , and how comes on your fifth volume ? You may probably think that for some time past I have neglected you and your work ; but , alas ! the hand of pain , and sorrow , and care , has these many months lain heavy on me ! Personal and domestic affliction have almost entirely banished that alacrity and life with which I used to woo the rural muse of Scotia . In the meantime let us finish what we have so well begun . You are a good , worthy , honest fellow , and have a good right to live in this world — because you deserve it . Many a merry meeting this publication has given us , and possibly it may give us more , though , alas ! I fear it . This protracting , slow , consuming illness which hangs over me , will , I doubt much , my ever dear friend , arrest my sun before he has well reached his middle career , and will turn over the poet to other and far more important concerns than studying the brilliancy of wit , or the pathos of sentiment ! However , hope is the cordial of the human heart , and I endeavour to cherish it as well as I can . Let me hear from you as soon as convenient .— Your work is a great one ; and now that it is finished , I see , if we were to begin again , two or three things that might be mended ; yet I will venture to prophesy , that to future ages your publication will be the text-book and standard of Scottish song and music . I am ashamed to ask another favour of you , because you have been so very good already ; but my wife has a very particular friend of hers , a young lady who sings well , to whom she wishes to present the “ Scots Musical Museum . ” If you have a spare copy , will you be so obliging as to send it by the very first fly , as I am anxious to have it soon . The gentleman , Mr. Lewars , a particular friend of mine , will bring out any proofs ( if they are ready ) or any message you may have . I am extremely anxious for your work , as indeed I am for everything concerning you , and your welfare . Farewell , R. B. P. S. You should have had this when Mr. Lewars called on you , but his saddle-bags miscarried . CCCXXXVII . TO MR. CUNNINGHAM . [ Few of the last requests of the poet were effectual : Clarke , it is believed , did not send the second note he wrote for : Johnson did not send the copy of the Museum which he requested , and the Commissioners of Excise refused the continuance of his full salary . ] Brow , Sea-bathing quarters , 7th July , 1796 . MY DEAR CUNNINGHAM , I received yours here this moment , and am indeed highly flattered with the approbation of the literary circle you mention ; a literary circle inferior to none in the two kingdoms . Alas ! my friend , I fear the voice of the bard will soon be heard among you no more ! For these eight or ten months I have been ailing , sometimes bedfast and sometimes not ; but these last three months I have been tortured with an excruciating rheumatism , which has reduced me to nearly the last stage . You actually would not know me if you saw me — Pale , emaciated , and so feeble , as occasionally to need help from my chair — my spirits fled ! fled ! but I can no more on the subject — only the medical folks tell me that my last only chance is bathing and country-quarters , and riding .— The deuce of the matter is this ; when an exciseman is off duty , his salary is reduced to 35l . instead of 50l .— What way , in the name of thrift , shall I maintain myself , and keep a horse in country quarters — with a wife and five children at home , on 35l .? I mention this , because I had intended to beg your utmost interest , and that of all the friends you can muster , to move our commissioners of excise to grant me the full salary ; I dare say you know them all personally . If they do not grant it me , I must lay my account with an exit truly en poëte — if I die not of disease , I must perish with hunger . I have sent you one of the songs ; the other my memory does not serve me with , and I have no copy here ; but I shall be at home soon , when I will send it you .— Apropos to being at home , Mrs. Burns threatens , in a week or two , to add one more to my paternal charge , which , if of the right gender , I intend shall be introduced to the world by the respectable designation of Alexander Cunningham Burns . My last was James Glencairn , so you can have no objection to the company of nobility . Farewell . R. B. CCCXXXVIII . TO MR. GILBERT BURNS . [ This letter contained heavy news for Gilbert Burns : the loss of a brother whom he dearly loved and admired , was not all , though the worst . ] 10th July , 1796 . DEAR BROTHER , It will be no very pleasing news to you to be told that I am dangerously ill , and not likely to get better . An inveterate rheumatism has reduced me to such a state of debility , and my appetite is so totally gone , that I can scarcely stand on my legs . I have been a week at sea-bathing , and I will continue there , or in a friend 's house in the country , all the summer . God keep my wife and children : if I am taken from their head , they will be poor indeed . I have contracted one or two serious debts , partly from my illness these many months , partly from too much thoughtlessness as to expense , when I came to town , that will cut in too much on the little I leave them in your hands . Remember me to my mother . Yours , R. B. CCCXXXIX . TO MR. JAMES ARMOUR , MASON , MAUCHLINE . [ The original letter is now in a safe sanctuary , the hands of the poet 's son , Major James Glencairn Burns . ] July 10th [ 1796 . ] For Heaven 's sake , and as you value the we [ l ] fare of your daughter and my wife , do , my dearest Sir , write to Fife , to Mrs. Armour to come if possible . My wife thinks she can yet reckon upon a fortnight . The medical people order me , as I value my existence , to fly to sea-bathing and country-quarters , so it is ten thousand chances to one that I shall not be within a dozen miles of her when her hour comes . What a situation for her , poor girl , without a single friend by her on such a serious moment . I have now been a week at salt-water , and though I think I have got some good by it , yet I have some secret fears that this business will be dangerous if not fatal . Your most affectionate son , R. B. CCCXL . TO MRS. BURNS . [ Sea-bathing , I have heard skilful men say , was injudicious : but it was felt that Burns was on his way to the grave , and as he desired to try the influence of sea-water , as well as sea-air , his wishes were not opposed . ] Brow , Thursday . MY DEAREST LOVE , I delayed writing until I could tell you what effect sea-bathing was likely to produce . It would be injustice to deny that it has eased my pains , and I think has strengthened me ; but my appetite is still extremely bad . No flesh nor fish can I swallow : porridge and milk are the only things I can taste . I am very happy to hear , by Miss Jess Lewars , that you are all well . My very best and kindest compliments to her , and to all the children . I will see you on Sunday . Your affectionate husband , R. B. CCCXLI . TO MRS. DUNLOP . [ “ The poet had the pleasure of receiving a satisfactory explanation of this lady 's silence , ” says Currie , “ and an assurance of the continuance of her friendship to his widow and children . ” ] Brow , Saturday , 12th July , 1796 . MADAM , I have written you so often , without receiving any answer , that I would not trouble you again , but for the circumstances in which I am . An illness which has long hung about me , in all probability will speedily send me beyond that bourn whence no traveller returns . Your friendship , with which for many years you honoured me , was a friendship dearest to my soul . Your conversation , and especially your correspondence , were at once highly entertaining and instructive . With what pleasure did I use to break up the seal ! The remembrance yet adds one pulse more to my poor palpitating heart . Farewell !!! R. B. CCCXLII . TO MR. THOMSON . [ Thomson instantly complied with the dying poet 's request , and transmitted the exact sum which he requested , viz . five pounds , by return of post : he was afraid of offending the pride of Burns , otherwise he would , he says , have sent a larger sum . He has not , however , told us how much he sent to the all but desolate widow and children , when death had released him from all dread of the poet 's indignation . ] Brow , on the Solway-firth , 12th July , 1796 . After all my boasted independence , curst necessity compels me to implore you for five pounds . A cruel wretch of a haberdasher , to whom I owe an account , taking it into his head that I am dying , has commenced a process , and will infallibly put me into jail . Do , for God 's sake , send me that sum , and that by return of post . Forgive me this earnestness , but the horrors of a jail have made me half distracted . I do not ask all this gratuitously ; for , upon returning health , I hereby promise and engage to furnish you with five pounds ’ worth of the neatest song-genius you have seen . I tried my hand on “ Rothemurche ” this morning . The measure is so difficult that it is impossible to infuse much genius into the lines ; they are on the other side . Forgive , forgive me ! Fairest maid on Devon 's banks .<span type="note_anchor">[ 292 ]</span>R. B. FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 292 : Song CCLXVIII . ] CCCXLIII . TO MR. JAMES BURNESS , WRITER , MONTROSE . [ The good , the warm-hearted James Burness sent his cousin ten pounds on the 29th of July — he sent five pounds afterwards to the family , and offered to take one of the boys , and educate him in his own profession of a writer . All this was unknown to the world till lately . ] Brow , 12th July . MY DEAR COUSIN , When you offered me money assistance , little did I think I should want it so soon . A rascal of a haberdasher , to whom I owe a considerable bill , taking it into his head that I am dying , has commenced process against me , and will infallibly put my emaciated body into jail . Will you be so good as to accommodate me , and that by return of post , with ten pounds ? O James ! did you know the pride of my heart , you would feel doubly for me ! Alas ! I am not used to beg ! The worst of it is , my health was coming about finely ; you know , and my physician assured me , that melancholy and low spirits are half my disease ; guess then my horrors since this business began . If I had it settled , I would be , I think , quite well in a manner . How shall I use the language to you , O do not disappoint me ! but strong necessity 's curst command . I have been thinking over and over my brother 's affairs , and I fear I must cut him up ; but on this I will correspond at another time , particularly as I shall [ require ] your advice . Forgive me for once more mentioning by return of post ;— save me from the horrors of a jail ! My compliments to my friend James , and to all the rest . I do not know what I have written . The subject is so horrible I dare not look it over again . Farewell . R. B. CCCXLIV . TO JAMES GRACIE , ESQ . [ James Gracie was , for some time , a banker in Dumfries : his eldest son , a fine , high-spirited youth , fell by a rifle-ball in America , when leading the troops to the attack on Washington . ] Brow , Wednesday Morning , 16th July , 1796 . MY DEAR SIR , It would [ be ] doing high injustice to this place not to acknowledge that my rheumatisms have derived great benefits from it already ; but alas ! my loss of appetite still continues . I shall not need your kind offer this week , and I return to town the beginning of next week , it not being a tide-week . I am detaining a man in a burning hurry . So God bless you . R. B . REMARKS ON SCOTTISH SONGS AND BALLADS . [ The following Strictures on Scottish Song exist in the handwriting of Burns , in the interleaved copy of Johnson 's Musical Museum , which the poet presented to Captain Riddel , of Friars Carse ; on the death of Mrs. Riddel , these precious volumes passed into the hands of her niece , Eliza Bayley , of Manchester , who kindly permitted Mr. Cromek to transcribe and publish them in the Reliques . ] THE HIGHLAND QUEEN . This Highland Queen , music and poetry , was composed by Mr. M'Vicar , purser of the Solebay man-of-war .— This I had from Dr. Blacklock . BESS THE GAWKIE . This song shows that the Scottish muses did not all leave us when we lost Ramsay and Oswald , as I have good reason to believe that the verses and music are both posterior to the days of these two gentlemen . It is a beautiful song , and in the genuine Scots taste . We have few pastoral compositions , I mean the pastoral of nature , that are equal to this . OH , OPEN THE DOOR , LORD GREGORY . It is somewhat singular , that in Lanark , Renfrew , Ayr , Wigton , Kirkudbright , and Dumfries-shires , there is scarcely an old song or tune which , from the title , &amp; c ., can be guessed to belong to , or be the production of these countries . This , I conjecture , is one of these very few ; as the ballad , which is a long one , is called , both by tradition and in printed collections , “ The Lass of Lochroyan , ” which I take to be Lochroyan , in Galloway . THE BANKS OF THE TWEED . This song is one of the many attempts that English composers have made to imitate the Scottish manner , and which I shall , in these strictures , beg leave to distinguish by the appellation of Anglo-Scottish productions . The music is pretty good , but the verses are just above contempt . THE BEDS OF SWEET ROSES . This song , as far as I know , for the first time appears here in print .— When I was a boy , it was a very popular song in Ayrshire . I remember to have heard those fanatics , the Buchanites , sing some of their nonsensical rhymes , which they dignify with the name of hymns , to this air . ROSLIN CASTLE . These beautiful verses were the production of a Richard Hewit , a young man that Dr. Blacklock , to whom I am indebted for the anecdote , kept for some years as amanuensis . I do not know who is the author of the second song to the tune . Tytler , in his amusing history of Scots music , gives the air to Oswald ; but in Oswald 's own collection of Scots tunes , where he affixes an asterisk to those he himself composed , he does not make the least claim to the tune . SAW YE JOHNNIE CUMMIN ? QUO ’ SHE . This song , for genuine humour in the verses , and lively originality in the air , is unparalleled . I take it to be very old . CLOUT THE CALDRON . A tradition is mentioned in the “ Bee , ” that the second Bishop Chisholm , of Dunblane , used to say , that if he were going to be hanged , nothing would soothe his mind so much by the way as to hear “ Clout the Caldron ” played . I have met with another tradition , that the old song to this tune , “ Hae ye onie pots or pans , Or onie broken chanlers , ” was composed on one of the Kenmure family , in the cavalier times ; and alluded to an amour he had , while under hiding , in the disguise of an itinerant tinker . The air is also known by the name of “ The blacksmith and his apron , ” which from the rhythm , seems to have been a line of some old song to the tune . SAW YE MY PEGGY . This charming song is much older , and indeed superior to Ramsay 's verses , “ The Toast , ” as he calls them . There is another set of the words , much older still , and which I take to be the original one , but though it has a very great deal of merit , it is not quite ladies ’ reading . The original words , for they can scarcely be called verses , seem to be as follows ; a song familiar from the cradle to every Scottish ear . “ Saw ye my Maggie , Saw ye my Maggie , Saw ye my Maggie Linkin o'er the lea ? High kilted was she , High kilted was she , High kilted was she , Her coat aboon her knee . What mark has your Maggie , What mark has your Maggie , What mark has your Maggie , That ane may ken her be ? ” Though it by no means follows that the silliest verses to an air must , for that reason , be the original song ; yet I take this ballad , of which I have quoted part , to be old verses . The two songs in Ramsay , one of them evidently his own , are never to be met with in the fire-side circle of our peasantry ; while that which I take to be the old song , is in every shepherd 's mouth . Ramsay , I suppose , had thought the old verses unworthy of a place in his collection . THE FLOWERS OF EDINBURGH . This song is one of the many effusions of Scots Jacobitism .— The title “ Flowers of Edinburgh , ” has no manner of connexion with the present verses , so I suspect there has been an older set of words , of which the title is all that remains . By the bye , it is singular enough that the Scottish muses were all Jacobites .— I have paid more attention to every description of Scots songs than perhaps anybody living has done , and I do not recollect one single stanza , or even the title of the most trifling Scots air , which has the least panegyrical reference to the families of Nassau or Brunswick ; while there are hundreds satirizing them .— This may be thought no panegyric on the Scots Poets , but I mean it as such . For myself , I would always take it as a compliment to have it said , that my heart ran before my head ,— and surely the gallant though unfortunate house of Stewart , the kings of our fathers for so many heroic ages , is a theme * * * * * * JAMIE GAY . Jamie Gay is another and a tolerable Anglo-Scottish piece . MY DEAR JOCKIE . Another Anglo-Scottish production . FYE , GAE RUB HER O'ER WI ’ STRAE . It is self-evident that the first four lines of this song are part of a song more ancient than Ramsay 's beautiful verses which are annexed to them . As music is the language of nature ; and poetry , particularly songs , are always less or more localized ( if I may be allowed the verb ) by some of the modifications of time and place , this is the reason why so many of our Scots airs have outlived their original , and perhaps many subsequent sets of verses ; except a single name or phrase , or sometimes one or two lines , simply to distinguish the tunes by . To this day among people who know nothing of Ramsay 's verses , the following is the song , and all the song that ever I heard : “ Gin ye meet a bonnie lassie , Gie her a kiss and let her gae ; But gin ye meet a dirty hizzie , Fye , gae rub her o'er wi ’ strae . Fye , gae rub her , rub her , rub her , Fye , gae rub her o'er wi ’ strae : An ’ gin ye meet dirty hizzie , Fye , gae rub her o'er wi ’ strae . ” THE LASS O ’ LIVISTON . The old song , in three eight-line stanzas , is well known , and has merit as to wit and humour ; but it is rather unfit for insertion .— It begins , “ The Bonnie lass o ’ Liviston , Her name ye ken , her name ye ken , And she has written in her contract To lie her lane , to lie her lane . ” &amp; c. &amp; c. THE LAST TIME I CAME O'ER THE MOOR . Ramsay found the first line of this song , which had been preserved as the title of the charming air , and then composed the rest of the verses to suit that line . This has always a finer effect than composing English words , or words with an idea foreign to the spirit of the old title . Where old titles of songs convey any idea at all , it will generally be found to be quite in the spirit of the air . JOCKIE 'S GRAY BREEKS . Though this has certainly every evidence of being a Scottish air , yet there is a well-known tune and song in the north of Ireland , called “ The Weaver and his Shuttle O , ” which , though sung much quicker , is every note the very tune . THE HAPPY MARRIAGE . Another , but very pretty Anglo-Scottish piece . THE LASS OF PATIE 'S MILL . In Sinclair 's Statistical Account of Scotland , this song is localized ( a verb I must use for want of another to express my idea ) somewhere in the north of Scotland , and likewise is claimed by Ayrshire .— The following anecdote I had from the present Sir William Cunningham , of Robertland , who had it from the last John , Earl of Loudon . The then Earl of Loudon , and father to Earl John before mentioned , had Ramsay at Loudon , and one day walking together by the banks of Irvine water , near New-Mills , at a place called Patie 's Mill , they were struck with the appearance of a beautiful country girl . His lordship observed that she would be a fine theme for a song .— Allan lagged behind in returning to Loudon Castle , and at dinner produced this identical song . THE TURNIMSPIKE . There is a stanza of this excellent song for local humour , omitted in this set .— Where I have placed the asterisms . “ They tak the horse then by te head , And tere tey mak her stan ’ , man ; Me tell tem , me hae seen te day , Tey no had sic comman ’ , man . ” HIGHLAND LADDIE . As this was a favourite theme with our later Scottish muses , there are several airs and songs of that name . That which I take to be the oldest , is to be found in the “ Musical Museum , ” beginning , “ I hae been at Crookieden . ” One reason for my thinking so is , that Oswald has it in his collection , by the name of “ The Auld Highland Laddie . ” It is also known by the name of “ Jinglan Johnie , ” which is a well-known song of four or five stanzas , and seems to be an earlier song than Jacobite times . As a proof of this , it is little known to the peasantry by the name of “ Highland Laddie ; ” while everybody knows “ Jinglan Johnie . ” The song begins “ Jinglan John , the meickle man , He met wi ’ a lass was blythe and bonie . ” Another “ Highland Laddie ” is also in the “ Museum , ” vol . v ., which I take to be Ramsay 's original , as he has borrowed the chorus — “ O my bonie Highland lad , ” &amp; c. It consists of three stanzas , besides the chorus ; and has humour in its composition — it is an excellent , but somewhat licentious song .— It begins “ As I cam o'er Cairney mount , And down among the blooming heather . ” This air , and the common “ Highland Laddie , ” seem only to be different sets . Another “ Highland Laddie , ” also in the “ Museum , ” vol . v ., is the tune of several Jacobite fragments . One of these old songs to it , only exists , as far as I know , in these four lines — “ Where hae ye been a ’ day , Bonie laddie , Highland laddie ? Down the back o ’ Bell 's brae , Courtin Maggie , courtin Maggie . ” Another of this name is Dr. Arne 's beautiful air , called the new “ Highland Laddie . ” THE GENTLE SWAIN . To sing such a beautiful air to such execrable verses , is downright prostitution of common sense ! The Scots verses indeed are tolerable . HE STOLE MY TENDER HEART AWAY . This is an Anglo-Scottish production , but by no means a bad one . FAIREST OF THE FAIR . It is too barefaced to take Dr. Percy 's charming song , and by means of transposing a few English words into Scots , to offer to pass it for a Scots song .— I was not acquainted with the editor until the first volume was nearly finished , else , had I known in time , I would have prevented such an impudent absurdity . THE BLAITHRIE O'T . The following is a set of this song , which was the earliest song I remember to have got by heart . When a child , an old woman sung it to me , and I picked it up , every word , at first hearing . “ O Willy , weel I mind , I lent you my hand To sing you a song which you did me command ; But my memory 's so bad I had almost forgot That you called it the gear and the blaithrie o't .— I 'll not sing about confusion , delusion or pride , I 'll sing about a laddie was for a virtuous bride ; For virtue is an ornament that time will never rot , And preferable to gear and the blaithrie o't .— Tho ’ my lassie hae nae scarlets or silks to put on , We envy not the greatest that sits upon the throne ; I wad rather hae my lassie , tho ’ she cam in her smock , Than a princess wi ’ the gear and the blaithrie o't .— Tho ’ we hae nae horses or menzies at command , We will toil on our foot , and we 'll work wi ’ our hand ; And when wearied without rest , we 'll find it sweet in any spot , And we 'll value not the gear and the blaithrie o't .— If we hae ony babies , we 'll count them as lent ; Hae we less , hae we mair , we will ay be content ; For they say they hae mair pleasure that wins bu groat , Than the miser wi ’ his gear and the blaithrie o't — I 'll not meddle wi ’ th ’ affairs of the kirk or the queen ; They 're nae matters for a sang , let them sink , let them swim ; On your kirk I 'll ne'er encroach , but I 'll hold it stil remote , Sae tak this for the gear and the blaithrie o't . ” MAY EVE , OR KATE OF ABERDEEN . “ Kate of Aberdeen ” is , I believe , the work of poor Cunningham the player ; of whom the following anecdote , though told before , deserves a recital . A fat dignitary of the church coming past Cunningham one Sunday , as the poor poet was busy plying a fishing-rod in some stream near Durham , his native country , his reverence reprimanded Cunningham very severely for such an occupation on such a day . The poor poet , with that inoffensive gentleness of manners which was his peculiar characteristic , replied , that he hoped God and his reverence would forgive his seeming profanity of that sacred day , “ as he had no dinner to eat , but what lay at the bottom of that pool ! ” This , Mr. Woods , the player , who knew Cunningham well , and esteemed him much , assured me was true . TWEED SIDE . In Ramsay 's Tea-table Miscellany , he tells us that about thirty of the songs in that publication were the works of some young gentlemen of his acquaintance ; which songs are marked with the letters D. C. &amp; c .— Old Mr. Tytler of Woodhouselee , the worthy and able defender of the beauteous Queen of Scots , told me that the songs marked C , in the Tea-table , were the composition of a Mr. Crawfurd , of the house of Achnames , who was afterwards unfortunately drowned coming from France .— As Tytler was most intimately acquainted with Allan Ramsay , I think the anecdote may be depended on . Of consequence , the beautiful song of Tweed Side is Mr. Crawfurd 's , and indeed does great honour to his poetical talents . He was a Robert Crawfurd ; the Mary he celebrates was a Mary Stewart , of the Castle-Milk family , afterwards married to a Mr. John Ritchie . I have seen a song , calling itself the original Tweed Side , and said to have been composed by a Lord Yester . It consisted of two stanzas , of which I still recollect the first — “ When Maggy and I was acquaint , I carried my noddle fu ’ hie ; Nae lintwhite on a ’ the green plain , Nor gowdspink sae happy as me : But I saw her sae fair and I lo'ed : I woo 'd , but I came nae great speed ; So now I maun wander abroad , And lay my banes far frae the Tweed . ” — THE POSY . It appears evident to me that Oswald composed his Roslin Castle on the modulation of this air .— In the second part of Oswald 's , in the three first bars , he has either hit on a wonderful similarity to , or else he has entirely borrowed the three first bars of the old air ; and the close of both tunes is almost exactly the same . The old verses to which it was sung , when I took down the notes from a country girl 's voice , had no great merit .— The following is a specimen : “ There was a pretty May , and a milkin she went ; Wi ’ her red rosy cheeks , and her coal black hair ; And she has met a young man a comin o'er the bent , With a double and adieu to thee , fair May . O where are ye goin , my ain pretty May , Wi ’ thy red rosy cheeks , and thy coal black hair ? Unto the yowes a milkin , kind sir , she says , With a double and adieu to thee , fair May . What if I gang alang with thee , my ain pretty May , Wi ’ thy red rosy cheeks , any thy coal-black hair ; Wad I be aught the warse o ’ that , kind sir , she says , With a double and adieu to thee , fair May . ” MARY 'S DREAM . The Mary here alluded to is generally supposed to be Miss Mary Macghie , daughter to the Laird of Airds , in Galloway . The poet was a Mr. John Lowe , who likewise wrote another beautiful song , called Pompey 's Ghost .— I have seen a poetic epistle from him in North America , where he now is , or lately was , to a lady in Scotland .— By the strain of the verses , it appeared that they allude to some love affair . THE MAID THAT TENDS THE GOATS . BY MR. DUDGEON . This Dudgeon is a respectable farmer 's son in Berwickshire . I WISH MY LOVE WERE IN A MIRE . I never heard more of the words of this old song than the title . ALLAN WATER . This Allan Water , which the composer of the music has honoured with the name of the air , I have been told is Allan Water , in Strathallan . THERE 'S NAE LUCK ABOUT THE HOUSE . This is one of the most beautiful songs in the Scots , or any other language .— The two lines , “ And will I see his face again ! And will I hear him speak ! ” as well as the two preceding ones , are unequalled almost by anything I ever heard or read : and the lines , “ The present moment is our ain , The neist we never saw , ” — are worthy of the first poet . It is long posterior to Ramsay 's days . About the year 1771 , or 72 , it came first on the streets as a ballad ; and I suppose the composition of the song was not much anterior to that period . TARRY WOO . This is a very pretty song ; but I fancy that the first half stanza , as well as the tune itself , are much older than the rest of the words . GRAMACHREE . The song of Gramachree was composed by a Mr. Poe , a counsellor at law in Dublin . This anecdote I had from a gentleman who knew the lady , the “ Molly , ” who is the subject of the song , and to whom Mr. Poe sent the first manuscript of his most beautiful verses . I do not remember any single line that has more true pathos than “ How can she break that honest heart that wears her in its core ! ” But as the song is Irish , it had nothing to do in this collection . THE COLLIER 'S BONNIE LASSIE . The first half stanza is much older than the days of Ramsay .— The old words began thus : “ The collier has a dochter , and , O , she 's wonder bonnie ! A laird he was that sought her , rich baith in lands and money . She wad na hae a laird , nor wad she be a lady , But she wad hae a collier , the colour o ’ her daddie . ” MY AIN KIND DEARIE-O . The old words of this song are omitted here , though much more beautiful than these inserted ; which were mostly composed by poor Fergusson , in one of his merry humours . The old words began thus : “ I 'll rowe thee o'er the lea-rig , My ain kind dearie , O , I 'll rowe thee o'er the lea-rig , My ain kind dearie , O , Altho ’ the night were ne'er sae wat , And I were ne'er sae weary , O ; I 'll rowe thee o'er the lea-rig , My ain kind dearie , O . ” — MARY SCOTT , THE FLOWER OF YARROW . Mr. Robertson , in his statistical account of the parish of Selkirk , says , that Mary Scott , the Flower of Yarrow , was descended from the Dryhope , and married into the Harden family . Her daughter was married to a predecessor of the present Sir Francis Elliot , of Stobbs , and of the late Lord Heathfield . There is a circumstance in their contract of marriage that merits attention , and it strongly marks the predatory spirit of the times . The father-in-law agrees to keep his daughter for some time after the marriage ; for which the son-in-law binds himself to give him the profits of the first Michaelmas moon ! DOWN THE BURN , DAVIE . I have been informed , that the tune of “ Down the burn , Davie , ” was the composition of David Maigh , keeper of the blood slough hounds , belonging to the Laird of Riddel , in Tweeddale . BLINK O'ER THE BURN , SWEET BETTIE . The old words , all that I remember , are ,— “ Blink over the burn , sweet Betty , It is a cauld winter night : It rains , it hails , it thunders , The moon , she gies nae light : It 's a ’ for the sake o ’ sweet Betty , That ever I tint my way ; Sweet , let me lie beyond thee Until it be break o ’ day .— O , Betty will bake my bread , And Betty will brew my ale , And Betty will be my love , When I come over the dale : Blink over the burn , sweet Betty , Blink over the burn to me , And while I hae life , dear lassie , My ain sweet Betty thou 's be . ” THE BLITHSOME BRIDAL . I find the “ Blithsome Bridal ” in James Watson 's collection of Scots poems , printed at Edinburgh , in 1706 . This collection , the publisher says , is the first of its nature which has been published in our own native Scots dialect — it is now extremely scarce . JOHN HAY 'S BONNIE LASSIE . John Hay 's “ Bonnie Lassie ” was daughter of John Hay , Earl or Marquis of Tweeddale , and late Countess Dowager of Roxburgh .— She died at Broomlands , near Kelso , some time between the years 1720 and 1740 . THE BONIE BRUCKET LASSIE . The two first lines of this song are all of it that is old . The rest of the song , as well as those songs in the Museum marked T ., are the works of an obscure , tippling , but extraordinary body of the name of Tytler , commonly known by the name of Balloon Tytler , from his having projected a balloon ; a mortal , who , though he drudges about Edinburgh as a common printer , with leaky shoes , a sky-lighted hat , and knee-buckles as unlike as George-by-the-grace-of-God , and Solomon-the-son-of-David ; yet that same unknown drunken mortal is author and compiler of three-fourths of Elliot 's pompous Encyclopedia Britannica , which he composed at half a guinea a week ! SAE MERRY AS WE TWA HA'E BEEN . This song is beautiful .— The chorus in particular is truly pathetic . I never could learn anything of its author . CHORUS . “ Sae merry as we twa ha'e been , Sae merry as we twa ha'e been ; My heart is like for to break , When I think on the days we ha'e seen . ” THE BANKS OF FORTH . This air is Oswald 's . THE BUSH ABOON TRAQUAIR . This is another beautiful song of Mr. Crawfurd 's composition . In the neighbourhood of Traquair , tradition still shows the old “ Bush ; ” which , when I saw it , in the year 1787 , was composed of eight or nine ragged birches . The Earl of Traquair has planted a clump of trees near by , which he calls “ The New Bush . ” CROMLET 'S LILT . The following interesting account of this plaintive dirge was communicated to Mr. Riddel by Alexander Fraser Tytler , Esq ., of Woodhouselee . “ In the latter end of the sixteenth century , the Chisolms were proprietors of the estate of Cromlecks ( now possessed by the Drummonds ) . The eldest son of that family was very much attached to a daughter of Sterling of Ardoch , commonly known by the name of Fair Helen of Ardoch . “ At that time the opportunities of meeting betwixt the sexes were more rare , consequently more sought after than now ; and the Scottish ladies , far from priding themselves on extensive literature , were thought sufficiently book-learned if they could make out the Scriptures in their mother-tongue . Writing was entirely out of the line of female education . At that period the most of our young men of family sought a fortune , or found a grave , in France . Cromlus , when he went abroad to the war , was obliged to leave the management of his correspondence with his mistress to a lay-brother of the monastery of Dumblain , in the immediate neighbourhood of Cromleck , and near Ardoch . This man , unfortunately , was deeply sensible of Helen 's charms . He artfully prepossessed her with stories to the disadvantage of Cromlus ; and , by misinterpreting or keeping up the letters and messages intrusted to his care , he entirely irritated both . All connexion was broken off betwixt them ; Helen was inconsolable , and Cromlus has left behind him , in the ballad called ‘ Cromlet 's Lilt , ’ a proof of the elegance of his genius , as well as the steadiness of his love . “ When the artful monk thought time had sufficiently softened Helen 's sorrow , he proposed himself as a lover : Helen was obdurate : but at last , overcome by the persuasions of her brother , with whom she lived , and who , having a family of thirty-one children , was probably very well pleased to get her off his hands — she submitted , rather than consented to the ceremony ; but there her compliance ended ; and , when forcibly put into bed , she started quite frantic from it , screaming out , that after three gentle taps on the wainscot , at the bed-head , she heard Cromlus 's voice , crying , ‘ Helen , Helen , mind me ! ’ Cromlus soon after coming home , the treachery of the confidant was discovered ,— her marriage disannulled ,— and Helen became Lady Cromlecks . ” N. B. Marg . Murray , mother to these thirty-one children , was daughter to Murray of Strewn , one of the seventeen sons of Tullybardine , and whose youngest son , commonly called the Tutor of Ardoch , died in the year 1715 , aged 111 years . MY DEARIE , IF THOU DIE . Another beautiful song of Crawfurd 's . SHE ROSE AND LOOT ME IN . The old set of this song , which is still to be found in printed collections , is much prettier than this ; but somebody , I believe it was Ramsay , took it into his head to clear it of some seeming indelicacies , and made it at once more chaste and more dull . GO TO THE EWE-BUGHTS , MARION . I am not sure if this old and charming air be of the South , as is commonly said , or of the North of Scotland . There is a song , apparently as ancient us “ Ewe-bughts , Marion , ” which sings to the same tune , and is evidently of the North .— It begins thus : “ The Lord o ’ Gordon had three dochters , Mary , Marget , and Jean , They wad na stay at bonie Castle Gordon , But awa to Aberdeen . ” LEWIS GORDON . This air is a proof how one of our Scots tunes comes to be composed out of another . I have one of the earliest copies of the song , and it has prefixed , “ Tune of Tarry Woo . ” — Of which tune a different set has insensibly varied into a different air .— To a Scots critic , the pathos of the line , “ ‘ Tho ’ his back be at the wa ’ , ” — must be very striking . It needs not a Jacobite prejudice to be affected with this song . The supposed author of “ Lewis Gordon ” was a Mr. Geddes , priest , at Shenval , in the Ainzie . O HONE A RIE . Dr. Blacklock informed me that this song was composed on the infamous massacre of Glencoe . I 'LL NEVER LEAVE THEE . This is another of Crawfurd 's songs , but I do not think in his happiest manner .— What an absurdity , to join such names as Adonis and Mary together ! CORN RIGS ARE BONIE . All the old words that ever I could meet to this air were the following , which seem to have been an old chorus : “ O corn rigs and rye rigs , O corn rigs are bonie ; And where'er you meet a bonie lass , Preen up her cockernony . ” THE MUCKING OF GEORDIE 'S BYRE . The chorus of this song is old ; the rest is the work of Balloon Tytler . BIDE YE YET . There is a beautiful song to this tune , beginning , “ Alas , my son , you little know , ” — which is the composition of Miss Jenny Graham , of Dumfries . WAUKIN O ’ THE FAULD . There are two stanzas still sung to this tune , which I take to be the original song whence Ramsay composed his beautiful song of that name in the Gentle Shepherd .— It begins “ O will ye speak at our town , As ye come frae the fauld . ” I regret that , as in many of our old songs , the delicacy of this old fragment is not equal to its wit and humour . TRANENT-MUIR . “ Tranent-Muir , ” was composed by a Mr. Skirving , a very worthy respectable farmer near Haddington . I have heard the anecdote often , that Lieut . Smith , whom he mentions in the ninth stanza , came to Haddington after the publication of the song , and sent a challenge to Skirving to meet him at Haddington , and answer for the unworthy manner in which he had noticed him in his song . “ Gang away back , ” said the honest farmer , “ and tell Mr. Smith that I hae nae leisure to come to Haddington ; but tell him to come here , and I 'll tak a look o ’ him , and if I think I 'm fit to fecht him , I 'll fecht him ; and if no , I 'll do as he did — I 'll rin awa . ” — TO THE WEAVERS GIN YE GO . The chorus of this song is old , the rest of it is mine . Here , once for all , let me apologize for many silly compositions of mine in this work . Many beautiful airs wanted words ; in the hurry of other avocations , if I could string a parcel of rhymes together anything near tolerable , I was fain to let them pass . He must be an excellent poet indeed whose every performance is excellent . POLWARTH ON THE GREEN . The author of “ Polwarth on the Green ” is Capt . John Drummond M'Gregor , of the family of Bochaldie . STREPHON AND LYDIA . The following account of this song I had from Dr. Blacklock . The Strephon and Lydia mentioned in the song were perhaps the loveliest couple of their time . The gentleman was commonly known by the name of Beau Gibson . The lady was the “ Gentle Jean , ” celebrated somewhere in Hamilton of Bangour 's poems .— Having frequently met at public places , they had formed a reciprocal attachment , which their friends thought dangerous , as their resources were by no means adequate to their tastes and habits of life . To elude the bad consequences of such a connexion , Strephon was sent abroad with a commission , and perished in Admiral Vernon 's expedition to Carthagena . The author of this song was William Wallace , Esq . of Cairnhill , in Ayrshire . I 'M O'ER YOUNG TO MARRY YET . The chorus of this song is old . The rest of it , such as it is , is mine . M'PHERSON ' S FAREWELL . M'Pherson , a daring robber , in the beginning of this century , was condemned to be hanged at the assizes of Inverness . He is said , when under sentence of death , to have composed this tune , which he called his own lament or farewell . Gow has published a variation of this fine tune as his own composition , which he calls “ The Princess Augusta . ” MY JO , JANET . Johnson , the publisher , with a foolish delicacy , refused to insert the last stanza of this humorous ballad . THE SHEPHERD 'S COMPLAINT . The words by a Mr. R. Scott , from the town or neighbourhood of Biggar . THE BIRKS OF ABERFELDY . I composed these stanzas standing under the falls of Aberfeldy , at or near Moness . THE HIGHLAND LASSIE O . This was a composition of mine in very early life , before I was known at all in the world . My Highland lassie was a warm-hearted , charming young creature as ever blessed a man with generous love . After a pretty long tract of the most ardent reciprocal attachment , we met by appointment on the second Sunday of May , in a sequestered spot by the banks of Ayr , where we spent the day in taking a farewell before she should embark for the West Highlands , to arrange matters among her friends for our projected change of life . At the close of autumn following she crossed the sea to meet me at Greenock , where she had scarce landed when she was seized with a malignant fever , which hurried my dear girl to the grave in a few days , before I could even hear of her last illness . FIFE , AND A ’ THE LANDS ABOUT IT . This song is Dr. Blacklock 's . He , as well as I , often gave Johnson verses , trifling enough perhaps , but they served as a vehicle to the music . WERE NA MY HEART LIGHT I WAD DIE . Lord Hailes , in the notes to his collection of ancient Scots poems , says that this song was the composition of a Lady Grissel Baillie , daughter of the first Earl of Marchmont , and wife of George Baillie , of Jerviswood . THE YOUNG MAN 'S DREAM . This song is the composition of Balloon Tytler . STRATHALLAN 'S LAMENT . This air in the composition of one of the worthiest and best-hearted men living — Allan Masterton , schoolmaster in Edinburgh . As he and I were both sprouts of Jacobitism we agreed to dedicate the words and air to that cause . To tell the matter-of-fact , except when my passions were heated by some accidental cause , my Jacobitism was merely by way of vive la bagatelle . UP IN THE MORNING EARLY . The chorus of this is old ; the two stanzas are mine . THE TEARS OF SCOTLAND . Dr. Blacklock told me that Smollet , who was at the bottom a great Jacobite , composed these beautiful and pathetic verses on the infamous depredations of the Duke of Cumberland after the battle of Culloden . WHAT WILL I DO GIN MY HOGGIE DIE . Dr. Walker , who was minister at Moffat in 1772 , and is now ( 1791 ) Professor of Natural History in the University of Edinburgh , told the following anecdote concerning this air .— He said , that some gentlemen , riding a few years ago through Liddesdale , stopped at a hamlet consisting of a few houses , called Moss Platt , when they were struck with this tune , which an old woman , spinning on a rock at her door , was singing . All she could tell concerning it was , that she was taught it when a child , and it was called “ What will I do gin my Hoggie die ? ” No person , except a few females at Moss Platt , knew this fine old tune , which in all probability would have been lost had not one of the gentlemen , who happened to have a flute with him , taken it down . I DREAM 'D I LAY WHERE FLOWERS WERE SPRINGING . These two stanzas I composed when I was seventeen , and are among the oldest of my printed pieces . AH ! THE POOR SHEPHERD 'S MOURNFUL FATE . Tune — “ Gallashiels . ” The old title , “ Sour Plums o ’ Gallashiels , ” probably was the beginning of a song to this air , which is now lost . The tune of Gallashiels was composed about the beginning of the present century by the Laird of Gallashiel 's piper . THE BANKS OF THE DEVON . These verses were composed on a charming girl , a Miss Charlotte Hamilton , who is now married to James M'Kitrick Adair , Esq ., physician . She is sister to my worthy friend Gavin Hamilton , of Mauchline , and was born on the banks of the Ayr , but was , at the time I wrote these lines , residing at Herveyston , in Clackmannanshire , on the romantic banks of the little river Devon . I first heard the air from a lady in Inverness , and got the notes taken down for this work . MILL , MILL O . The original , or at least a song evidently prior to Ramsay 's is still extant .— It runs thus , CHORUS . “ The mill , mill O , and the kill , kill O , And the coggin o ’ Peggy 's wheel , O , The sack and the sieve , and a ’ she did leave , And danc 'd the miller 's reel O .— As I came down yon waterside , And by yon shellin-hill O , There I spied a bonie bonie lass , And a lass that I lov 'd right well O . ” WE RAN AND THEY RAN . The author of “ We ran and they ran ” — was a Rev . Mr. Murdoch M'Lennan , minister at Crathie , Dee-side . WALY , WALY . In the west country I have heard a different edition of the second stanza .— Instead of the four lines , beginning with , “ When cockle-shells , &amp; c ., ” the other way ran thus :— “ O wherefore need I busk my head , Or wherefore need I kame my hair , Sin my fause luve has me forsook , And sys , he 'll never luve me mair . ” DUNCAN GRAY . Dr. Blacklock informed me that he had often heard the tradition , that this air was composed by a carman in Glasgow . DUMBARTON DRUMS . This is the last of the West-Highland airs ; and from it over the whole tract of country to the confines of Tweedside , there is hardly a tune or song that one can say has taken its origin from any place or transaction in that part of Scotland .— The oldest Ayrshire reel , is Stewarton Lasses , which was made by the father of the present Sir Walter Montgomery Cunningham , alias Lord Lysle ; since which period there has indeed been local music in that country in great plenty .— Johnie Faa is the only old song which I could ever trace as belonging to the extensive county of Ayr . CAULD KAIL IN ABERDEEN . This song is by the Duke of Gordon .— The old verses are , “ There 's cauld kail in Aberdeen , And castocks in Strathbogie ; When ilka lad maun hae his lass , Then fye , gie me my coggie . CHORUS . My coggie , Sirs , my coggie , Sirs , I cannot want my coggie ; I wadna gie my three-girr 'd cap For e'er a quene on Bogie .— There 's Johnie Smith has got a wife , That scrimps him o ’ his coggie , If she were mine , upon my life I wad douk her in a bogie . ” FOR LAKE OF GOLD . The country girls in Ayrshire , instead of the line — “ She me forsook for a great duke , ” say “ For Athole 's duke she me forsook ; ” which I take to be the original reading . These were composed by the late Dr. Austin , physician at Edinburgh .— He had courted a lady , to whom he was shortly to have been married ; but the Duke of Athole having seen her , became so much in love with her , that he made proposals of marriage , which were accepted of , and she jilted the doctor . HERE 'S A HEALTH TO MY TRUE LOVE , &amp; c. This song is Dr. Blacklock 's . He told me that tradition gives the air to our James IV . of Scotland . HEY TUTTI TAITI . I Have met the tradition universally over Scotland , and particularly about Stirling , in the neighbourhood of the scene , that this air was Robert Bruce 's march at the battle of Bannockburn . RAVING WINDS AROUND HER BLOWING . I Composed these verses on Miss Isabella M'Leod , of Raza , alluding to her feelings on the death of her sister , and the still more melancholy death of her sister 's husband , the late Earl of Loudon ; who shot himself out of sheer heart-break at some mortifications he suffered , owing to the deranged state of his finances . TAK YOUR AULD CLOAK ABOUT YE . A part of this old song , according to the English set of it , is quoted in Shakspeare . YE GODS , WAS STREPHON 'S PICTURE BLEST ? Tune — “ Fourteenth of October . ” The title of this air shows that it alludes to the famous king Crispian , the patron of the honourable corporation of shoemakers .— St . Crispian 's day falls on the fourteenth of October old style , as the old proverb tells : “ On the fourteenth of October Was ne'er a sutor sober . ” SINCE ROBB 'D OF ALL THAT CHARM 'D MY VIEWS . The old name of this air is , “ the Blossom o ’ the Raspberry . ” The song is Dr. Blacklock 's . YOUNG DAMON . This air is by Oswald . KIRK WAD LET ME BE . Tradition in the western parts of Scotland tells that this old song , of which there are still three stanzas extant , once saved a covenanting clergyman out of a scrape . It was a little prior to the revolution , a period when being a Scots covenanter was being a felon , that one of their clergy , who was at that very time hunted by the merciless soldiery , fell in , by accident , with a party of the military . The soldiers were not exactly acquainted with the person of the reverend gentleman of whom they were in search ; but from suspicious circumstances , they fancied that they had got one of that cloth and opprobrious persuasion among them in the person of this stranger . “ Mass John ” to extricate himself , assumed a freedom of manners , very unlike the gloomy strictness of his sect ; and among other convivial exhibitions , sung ( and some traditions say , composed on the spur of the occasion ) “ Kirk wad let me be , ” with such effect , that the soldiers swore he was a d —— d honest fellow , and that it was impossible he could belong to those hellish conventicles ; and so gave him his liberty . The first stanza of this song , a little altered , is a favourite kind of dramatic interlude acted at country weddings , in the south-west parts of the kingdom . A young fellow is dressed up like an old beggar ; a peruke , commonly made of carded tow , represents hoary locks ; an old bonnet ; a ragged plaid , or surtout , bound with a straw rope for a girdle ; a pair of old shoes , with straw ropes twisted round his ankles , as is done by shepherds in snowy weather : his face they disguise as like wretched old age as they can : in this plight he is brought into the wedding-house , frequently to the astonishment of strangers , who are not in the secret , and begins to sing — “ O , I am a silly auld man , My name it is auld Glenae , ” &amp; c. He is asked to drink , and by and bye to dance , which after some uncouth excuses he is prevailed on to do , the fiddler playing the tune , which here is commonly called “ Auld Glenae ; ” in short he is all the time so plied with liquor that he is understood to get intoxicated , and with all the ridiculous gesticulations of an old drunken beggar , he dances and staggers until he falls on the floor ; yet still in all his riot , nay , in his rolling and tumbling on the floor , with some or other drunken motion of his body , he beats time to the music , till at last he is supposed to be carried out dead drunk . MUSING ON THE ROARING OCEAN . I composed these verses out of compliment to a Mrs. M'Lachlan , whose husband is an officer in the East Indies . BLYTHE WAS SHE . I composed these verses while I stayed at Ochtertyre with Sir William Murray .— The lady , who was also at Ochtertyre at the same time , was the well-known toast , Miss Euphemia Murray , of Lentrose ; she was called , and very justly , “ The Flower of Strathmore . ” JOHNNIE FAA , OR THE GYPSIE LADDIE . The people in Ayrshire begin this song — “ The gypsies cam to my Lord Cassilis ’ yett . ” — They have a great many more stanzas in this song than I ever yet saw in any printed copy .— The castle is still remaining at Maybole , where his lordship shut up his wayward spouse , and kept her for life . TO DAUNTON ME . The two following old stanzas to this tune have some merit : “ To daunton me , to daunton me , O ken ye what it is that 'll daunton me ?— There 's eighty-eight and eighty-nine , And a ’ that I hae borne sinsyne , There 's cess and press and Presbytrie , I think it will do meikle for to daunton me . But to wanton me , to wanton me , O ken ye what it is that wad wanton me — To see gude corn upon the rigs , And banishment amang the Whigs , And right restor 'd where right sud be , I think it would do meikle for to wanton me . ” THE BONNIE LASS MADE THE BED TO ME . “ The Bonnie Lass made the Bed to me , ” was composed on an amour of Charles II . when skulking in the North , about Aberdeen , in the time of the usurpation . He formed une petite affaire with a daughter of the house of Portletham , who was the “ lass that made the bed to him : ” — two verses of it are , “ I kiss 'd her lips sae rosy red , While the tear stood blinkin in her e'e ; I said , My lassie , dinna cry , For ye ay shall make the bed to me . She took her mither 's holland sheets , And made them a ’ in sarks to me ; Blythe and merry may she be , The lass that made the bed to me . ” ABSENCE . A song in the manner of Shenstone . This song and air are both by Dr. Blacklock . I HAD A HORSE AND I HAD NAE MAIR . This story is founded on fact . A John Hunter , ancestor to a very respectable farming family , who live in a place in the parish , I think , of Galston , called Bar-mill , was the luckless hero that “ had a horse and had nae mair . ” — For some little youthful follies he found it necessary to make a retreat to the West-Highlands , where “ he feed himself to a Highland Laird , ” for that is the expression of all the oral editions of the song I ever heard .— The present Mr. Hunter , who told me the anecdote , is the great-grandchild of our hero . UP AND WARN A ’ WILLIE . This edition of the song I got from Tom Niel , of facetious fame , in Edinburgh . The expression “ Up and warn a ’ Willie , ” alludes to the Crantara , or warning of a Highland clan to arms . Not understanding this , the Lowlanders in the west and south say , “ Up and waur them a ’ , ” &amp; c. A ROSE-BUD BY MY EARLY WALK . This song I composed on Miss Jenny Cruikshank , only child of my worthy friend Mr. William Cruikshank , of the High-School , Edinburgh . This air is by a David Sillar , quondam merchant , and now schoolmaster in Irvine . He is the Davie to whom I address my printed poetical epistle in the measure of the Cherry and the Slae . AULD ROB MORRIS . It is remark-worthy that the song of “ Holy and Fairly , ” in all the old editions of it , is called “ The Drunken Wife o ’ Galloway , ” which localizes it to that country . RATTLIN , ROARIN WILLIE . The last stanza of this song is mine ; it was composed out of compliment to one of the worthiest fellows in the world , William Dunbar , Esq ., writer to the signet , Edinburgh , and Colonel of the Crochallan Corps , a club of wits who took that title at the time of raising the fencible regiments . WHERE BRAVING ANGRY WINTER STORMS . This song I composed on one of the most accomplished of women , Miss Peggy Chalmers , that was , now Mrs. Lewis Hay , of Forbes and Co .' s bank , Edinburgh . TIBBIE , I HAE SEEN THE DAY . This song I composed about the age of seventeen . NANCY 'S GHOST . This song is by Dr. Blacklock . TUNE YOUR FIDDLES , ETC . This song was composed by the Rev . John Skinner , nonjuror clergyman at Linshart , near Peterhead . He is likewise author of “ Tullochgorum , ” “ Ewie wi ’ the crooked Horn , ” “ John o ’ Badenyond , ” &amp; c ., and what is of still more consequence , he is one of the worthiest of mankind . He is the author of an ecclesiastical history of Scotland . The air is by Mr. Marshall , butler to the Duke of Gordon ; the first composer of strathspeys of the age . I have been told by somebody , who had it of Marshall himself , that he took the idea of his three most celebrated pieces , “ The Marquis of Huntley 's Reel , ” his “ Farewell , ” and “ Miss Admiral Gordon 's Reel , ” from the old air , “ The German Lairdie . ” GILL MORICE . This plaintive ballad ought to have been called Child Maurice , and not Gil Maurice . In its present dress , it has gained immortal honour from Mr. Home 's taking from it the ground-work of his fine tragedy of Douglas . But I am of opinion that the present ballad is a modern composition ; perhaps not much above the age of the middle of the last century ; at least I should be glad to see or hear of a copy of the present words prior to 1650 . That it was taken from an old ballad , called “ Child Maurice , ” now lost , I am inclined to believe ; but the present one may be classed with “ Hardyknute , ” “ Kenneth , ” “ Duncan , the Laird of Woodhouselie , ” “ Lord Livingston , ” “ Binnorie , ” “ The Death of Monteith , ” and many other modern productions , which have been swallowed by many readers as ancient fragments of old poems . This beautiful plaintive tune was composed by Mr. M'Gibbon , the selector of a collection of Scots tunes . R. B . In addition to the observations on Gil Morice , I add , that of the songs which Captain Riddel mentions , “ Kenneth ” and “ Duncan ” are juvenile compositions of Mr. M'Kenzie , “ The Man of Feeling . ” — M'Kenzie ' s father showed them in MS. to Dr. Blacklock , as the productions of his son , from which the Doctor rightly prognosticated that the young poet would make , in his more advanced years , a respectable figure in the world of letters . This I had from Blacklock . TIBBIE DUNBAR . This tune is said to be the composition of John M'Gill , fiddler , in Girvan . He called it after his own name . WHEN I UPON THY BOSOM LEAN . This song was the work of a very worthy facetious old fellow , John Lapraik , late of Dalfram , near Muirkirk ; which little property he was obliged to sell in consequence of some connexion as security for some persons concerned in that villanous bubble THE AYR BANK . He has often told me that he composed this song one day when his wife had been fretting o'er their misfortunes . MY HARRY WAS A GALLANT GAY . Tune — “ Highlander 's Lament . ” The oldest title I ever heard to this air , was , “ The Highland Watch 's Farewell to Ireland . ” The chorus I picked up from an old woman in Dumblane ; the rest of the song is mine . THE HIGHLAND CHARACTER . This tune was the composition of Gen. Reid , and called by him “ The Highland , or 42d Regiment 's March . ” The words are by Sir Harry Erskine . LEADER-HAUGHS AND YARROW . There is in several collections , the old song of “ Leader-Haughs and Yarrow . ” It seems to have been the work of one of our itinerant minstrels , as he calls himself , at the conclusion of his song , “ Minstrel Burn . ” THE TAILOR FELL THRO ’ THE BED , THIMBLE AN ’ A ’ . This air is the march of the corporation of tailors . The second and fourth stanzas are mine . BEWARE O ’ BONNIE ANN . I composed this song out of compliment to Miss Ann Masterton , the daughter of my friend Allan Masterton , the author of the air of Strathallan 's Lament , and two or three others in this work . THIS IS NO MINE AIN HOUSE . The first half stanza is old , the rest is Ramsay 's . The old words are — “ This is no mine ain house , My ain house , my ain house ; This is no mine ain house , I ken by the biggin o't . Bread and cheese are my door-cheeks , My door-cheeks , my door-cheeks ; Bread and cheese are my door-cheeks , And pancakes the riggin o't . This is no my ain wean ; My ain wean , my ain wean ; This is no my ain wean , I ken by the greetie o't . I 'll tak the curchie aff my head , Aff my head , aff my head ; I 'll tak the curchie aff my head , And row't about the feetie o't . ” The tune is an old Highland air , called “ Shuan truish willighan . ” LADDIE , LIE NEAR ME . This song is by Blacklock . THE GARDENER AND HIS PAIDLE . This air is the “ Gardener 's March . ” The title of the song only is old ; the rest is mine . THE DAY RETURNS , MY BOSOM BURNS . Tune .— “ Seventh of November . ” I composed this song out of compliment to one of the happiest and worthiest married couples in the world , Robert Riddel , Esq ., of Glenriddel , and his lady . At their fire-side I have enjoyed more pleasant evenings than at all the houses of fashionable people in this country put together ; and to their kindness and hospitality I am indebted for many of the happiest hours of my life . THE GABERLUNZIE MAN . The “ Gaberlunzie Man ” is supposed to commemorate an intrigue of James the Fifth . Mr. Callander , of Craigforth , published some years ago an edition of “ Christ 's Kirk on the Green , ” and the “ Gaberlunzie Man , ” with notes critical and historical . James the Fifth is said to have been fond of Gosford , in Aberlady parish , and that it was suspected by his contemporaries , that in his frequent excursions to that part of the country , he had other purposes in view besides golfing and archery . Three favourite ladies , Sandilands , Weir , and Oliphant ( one of them resided at Gosford , and the others in the neighbourhood ) , were occasionally visited by their royal and gallant admirer , which gave rise to the following advice to his majesty , from Sir David Lindsay , of the Mount , Lord Lyon . “ Sow not your seed on Sandylands , spend not your strength in Weir , And ride not on an Elephant , For gawing o ’ your gear . ” MY BONNIE MARY . This air is Oswald 's ; the first half stanza of the song is old , the rest mine . THE BLACK EAGLE . This song is by Dr. Fordyce , whose merits as a prose writer are well known . JAMIE , COME TRY ME . This air is Oswald 's ; the song mine . THE LAZY MIST . This song is mine . JOHNIE COPE . This satirical song was composed to commemorate General Cope 's defeat at Preston Pans , in 1745 , when he marched against the Clans . The air was the tune of an old song , of which I have heard some verses , but now only remember the title , which was , “ Will ye go the coals in the morning . ” I LOVE MY JEAN . This air is by Marshall ; the song I composed out of compliment to Mrs. Burns . N. B . It was during the honeymoon . CEASE , CEASE , MY DEAR FRIEND , TO EXPLORE . The song is by Dr. Blacklock ; I believe , but am not quite certain , that the air is his too . AULD ROBIN GRAY . This air was formerly called , “ The bridegroom greets when the sun gangs down . ” The words are by Lady Ann Lindsay , of the Balcarras family . DONALD AND FLORA . This is one of those fine Gaelic tunes , preserved from time immemorial in the Hebrides ; they seem to be the ground-work of many of our finest Scots pastoral tunes . The words of this song were written to commemorate the unfortunate expedition of General Burgoyne in America , in 1777 . O WERE I ON PARNASSUS ’ HILL . This air is Oswald 's ; the song I made out of compliment to Mrs. Burns . THE CAPTIVE ROBIN . This air is called “ Robie donna Gorach . ” THERE 'S A YOUTH IN THIS CITY . This air is claimed by Neil Gow , who calls it his lament for his brother . The first half-stanza of the song is old ; the rest mine . MY HEART 'S IN THE HIGHLANDS . The first half-stanza of this song is old ; the rest is mine . CA ’ THE EWES AND THE KNOWES . This beautiful song is in true old Scotch taste , yet I do not know that either air or words were in print before . THE BRIDAL O'T . This song is the work of a Mr. Alexander Ross , late schoolmaster at Lochlee ; and author of a beautiful Scots poem , called “ The Fortunate Shepherdess . ” “ They say that Jockey ‘ ll speed weel o't , They say that Jockey ‘ ll speed weel o't , For he grows brawer ilka day , I hope we 'll hae a bridal o't : For yesternight nae farder gane , The backhouse at the side wa ’ o't , He there wi ’ Meg was mirden seen , I hope we 'll hae a bridal o't . An ’ we had but a bridal o't , An ’ we had but a bridal o't , We 'd leave the rest unto gude luck , Altho ’ there should betide ill o't : For bridal days are merry times , And young folks like the coming o't , And scribblers they bang up their rhymes , And pipers they the bumming o't . The lasses like a bridal o't , The lasses like a bridal o't , Their braws maun be in rank and file , Altho ’ that they should guide ill o't : The boddom o ’ the kist is then Turn 'd up into the inmost o't , The end that held the kecks sae clean , Is now become the teemest o't . The bangster at the threshing o't . The bangster at the threshing o't , Afore it comes is fidgin-fain , And ilka day 's a clashing o't : He 'll sell his jerkin for a groat , His linder for anither o't , And e'er he want to clear his shot , His sark 'll pay the tither o't The pipers and the fiddlers o't , The pipers and the fiddlers o't , Can smell a bridal unco ’ far , And like to be the middlers o't ; Fan<span type="note_anchor">[ 293 ]</span>thick and threefold they convene , Ilk ane envies the tither o't , And wishes nane but him alane May ever see anither o't . Fan they hae done wi ’ eating o't , Fan they hae done wi ’ eating o't , For dancing they gae to the green , And aiblins to the beating o't : He dances best that dances fast , And loups at ilka reesing o't , And claps his hands frae hough to hough , And furls about the feezings o't . ” TODLEN HAME . This is perhaps the first bottle song that ever was composed . THE BRAES O ’ BALLOCHMYLE . This air is the composition of my friend Allan Masterton , in Edinburgh . I composed the verses on the amiable and excellent family of Whitefoords leaving Ballochmyle , when Sir John 's misfortunes had obliged him to sell the estate . THE RANTIN ’ DOG , THE DADDIE O'T . I composed this song pretty early in life , and sent it to a young girl , a very particular acquaintance of mine , who was at that time under a cloud . THE SHEPHERD 'S PREFERENCE . This song is Dr . Blacklock 's .— I do n't know how it came by the name , but the oldest appellation of the air was , “ Whistle and I 'll come to you , my lad . ” It has little affinity to the tune commonly known by that name . THE BONIE BANKS OF AYR . I composed this song as I conveyed my chest so far on the road to Greenock , where I was to embark in a few days for Jamaica . I meant it as my farewell dirge to my native land . JOHN O ’ BADENYON . This excellent song is the composition of my worthy friend , old Skinner , at Linshart . “ When first I cam to be a man Of twenty years or so , I thought myself a handsome youth , And fain the world would know ; In best attire I stept abroad , With spirits brisk and gay , And here and there and everywhere , Was like a morn in May ; No care had I nor fear of want , But rambled up and down , And for a beau I might have pass 'd In country or in town ; I still was pleas 'd where'er I went , And when I was alone , I tun 'd my pipe and pleas 'd myself Wi ’ John o ’ Badenyon . Now in the days of youthful prime A mistress I must find , For love , I heard , gave one an air And ev'n improved the mind : On Phillis fair above the rest Kind fortune fixt my eyes , Her piercing beauty struck my heart , And she became my choice ; To Cupid now with hearty prayer I offer 'd many a vow ; And danc 'd , and sung , and sigh 'd , and swore , As other lovers do ; But , when at last I breath 'd my flame , I found her cold as stone ; I left the jilt , and tun 'd my pipe To John o ’ Badenyon . When love had thus my heart beguil 'd With foolish hopes and vain , To friendship 's port I steer 'd my course , And laugh 'd at lover 's pain A friend I got by lucky chance ‘ Twas something like divine , An honest friend 's a precious gift , And such a gift was mine : And now , whatever might betide , A happy man was I , In any strait I knew to whom I freely might apply ; A strait soon came : my friend I try 'd ; He heard , and spurn 'd my moan ; I hy 'd me home , and tun 'd my pipe To John o ’ Badenyon . Methought I should be wiser next , And would a patriot turn , Began to doat on Johnny Wilks , And cry up Parson Horne . Their manly spirit I admir 'd , And prais 'd their noble zeal , Who had with flaming tongue and pen Maintain 'd the public weal ; But e'er a month or two had past , I found myself betray 'd , ‘ Twas self and party after all , For a ’ the stir they made ; At last I saw the factious knaves Insult the very throne , I curs 'd them a ’ , and tun 'd my pipe To John o ’ Badenyon . ” A WAUKRIFE MINNIE . I picked up this old song and tune from a country girl in Nithsdale .— I never met with it elsewhere in Scotland . “ Whare are you gaun , my bonie lass , Whare are you gaun , my hinnie , She answer 'd me right saucilie , An errand for my minnie . O whare live ye , my bonnie lass , O whare live ye , my hinnie , By yon burn-side , gin ye maun ken , In a wee house wi ’ my minnie . But I foor up the glen at e'en , To see my bonie lassie ; And lang before the gray morn cam , She was na hauf sa sacie . O weary fa ’ the waukrife cock , And the foumart lay his crawin ! He wauken 'd the auld wife frae her sleep , A wee blink or the dawin . An angry wife I wat she raise , And o'er the bed she brought her ; And wi ’ a mickle hazle rung She made her a weel pay 'd dochter . O fare thee weel , my bonie lass ! O fare thee weel , my hinnie ! Thou art a gay and a bonie lass , But thou hast a waukrife minnie . ” TULLOCHGORUM . This first of songs , is the master-piece of my old friend Skinner . He was passing the day , at the town of Cullen , I think it was , in a friend 's house whose name was Montgomery . Mrs. Montgomery observing , en passant , that the beautiful reel of Tullochgorum wanted words , she begged them of Mr. Skinner , who gratified her wishes , and the wishes of every Scottish song , in this most excellent ballad . These particulars I had from the author 's son , Bishop Skinner , at Aberdeen . FOR A ’ THAT AND A ’ THAT . This song is mine , all except the chorus . AULD LANG SYNE . Ramsay here , as usual with him , has taken the idea of the song , and the first line , from the old fragment which may be seen in the “ Museum , ” vol . v. WILLIE BREW 'D A PECK O ’ MAUT . This air is Masterton 's ; the song mine .— The occasion of it was this :— Mr. W. Nicol , of the High-School , Edinburgh , during the autumn vacation being at Moffat , honest Allan , who was at that time on a visit to Dalswinton , and I , went to pay Nicol a visit .— We had such a joyous meeting that Mr. Masterton and I agreed , each in our own way , that we should celebrate the business . KILLIECRANKIE . The battle of Killiecrankie was the last stand made by the clans for James , after his abdication . Here the gallant Lord Dundee fell in the moment of victory , and with him fell the hopes of the party . General Mackay , when he found the Highlanders did not pursue his flying army , said , “ Dundee must be killed , or he never would have overlooked this advantage . ” A great stone marks the spot where Dundee fell . THE EWIE WI ’ THE CROOKED HORN . Another excellent song of old Skinner 's . CRAIGIE-BURN WOOD . It is remarkable of this air that it is the confine of that country where the greatest part of our Lowland music ( so far as from the title , words , &amp; c ., we can localize it ) has been composed . From Craigie-burn , near Moffat , until one reaches the West Highlands , we have scarcely one slow air of any antiquity . The song was composed on a passion which a Mr. Gillespie , a particular friend of mine , had for a Miss Lorimer , afterwards a Mrs. Whelpdale . This young lady was born at Craigie-burn Wood .— The chorus is part of an old foolish ballad . FRAE THE FRIENDS AND LAND I LOVE . I added the four last lines , by way of giving a turn to the theme of the poem , such as it is . HUGHIE GRAHAM There are several editions of this ballad .— This , here inserted , is from oral tradition in Ayrshire , where , when I was a boy , it was a popular song .— It originally had a simple old tune , which I have forgotten . “ Our lords are to the mountains gane , A hunting o ’ the fallow deer , And they have gripet Hughie Graham , For stealing o ’ the bishop 's mare . And they have tied him hand and foot , And led him up , thro ’ Stirling town ; The lads and lasses met him there , Cried , Hughie Graham , thou art a loun . O lowse my right hand free , he says , And put my braid sword in the same ; He 's no in Stirling town this day , Dare tell the tale to Hughie Graham . Up then bespake the brave Whitefoord , As he sat by the bishop 's knee , Five hundred white stots I 'll gie you , If ye 'll let Hughie Graham gae free . O haud your tongue , the bishop says , And wi ’ your pleading let me be ; For tho ’ ten Grahams were in his coat , Hughie Graham this day shall die . Up then bespake the fair Whitefoord , As she sat by the bishop 's knee ; Five hundred white pence I 'll gie you , If ye 'll gie Hughie Graham to me . O haud your tongue now , lady fair , And wi ’ your pleading let it be ; Altho ’ ten Grahams were in his coat , It 's for my honour he maun die . They 've ta'en him to the gallows knowe , He looked to the gallows tree , Yet never colour left his cheek , Nor ever did he blink his e'e At length he looked around about , To see whatever he could spy : And there he saw his auld father , And he was weeping bitterly . O haud your tongue , my father dear , And wi ’ your weeping let it be ; Thy weeping 's sairer on my heart , Than a ’ that they can do to me . And ye may gie my brother John My sword that 's bent in the middle clear ; And let him come at twelve o'clock , And see me pay the bishop 's mare . And ye may gie my brother James My sword that 's bent in the middle brown ; And bid him come at four o'clock , And see his brother Hugh cut down . Remember me to Maggy my wife , The neist time ye gang o'er the moor , Tell her she staw the bishop 's mare , Tell her she was the bishop 's whore . And ye may tell my kith and kin , I never did disgrace their blood ; And when they meet the bishop 's cloak , To mak it shorter by the hood . ” A SOUTHLAND JENNY . This is a popular Ayrshire song , though the notes were never taken down before . It , as well as many of the ballad tunes in this collection , was written from Mrs. Burns 's voice . MY TOCHER 'S THE JEWEL . This tune is claimed by Nathaniel Gow .— It is notoriously taken from “ The muckin o ’ Gordie 's byre . ” — It is also to be found long prior to Nathaniel Gow 's era , in Aird 's Selection of Airs and Marches , the first edition under the name of “ The Highway to Edinburgh . ” THEN , GUID WIFE , COUNT THE LAWIN ’ . The chorus of this is part of an old song , no stanza of which I recollect . THERE 'LL NEVER BE PEACE TILL JAMIE COMES HAME . This tune is sometimes called “ There 's few gude fellows when Willie 's awa . ” — But I never have been able to meet with anything else of the song than the title . I DO CONFESS THOU ART SAE FAIR . This song is altered from a poem by Sir Robert Ayton , private secretary to Mary and Ann , Queens of Scotland .— The poem is to be found in James Watson 's Collection of Scots Poems , the earliest collection printed in Scotland . I think that I have improved the simplicity of the sentiments , by giving them a Scots dress . THE SODGER LADDIE . The first verse of this is old ; the rest is by Ramsay . The tune seems to be the same with a slow air , called “ Jackey Hume 's Lament ” — or , “ The Hollin Buss ” — or “ Ken ye what Meg o ’ the Mill has gotten ? ” WHERE WAD BONNIE ANNIE LIE . The old name of this tune is ,— “ Whare 'll our gudeman lie . ” A silly old stanza of it runs thus — “ O whare 'll our gudeman lie , Gudeman lie , gudeman lie , O whare 'll our gudeman lie , Till he shute o'er the simmer ? Up amang the hen-bawks , The hen-bawks , the hen-bawks , Up amang the hen-bawks , Amang the rotten timmer . ” GALLOWAY TAM . I have seen an interlude ( acted at a wedding ) to this tune , called “ The Wooing of the Maiden . ” These entertainments are now much worn out in this part of Scotland . Two are still retained in Nithsdale , viz . “ Silly Pure Auld Glenae , ” and this one , “ The Wooing of the Maiden . ” AS I CAM DOWN BY YON CASTLE WA . This is a very popular Ayrshire song . LORD RONALD MY SON . This air , a very favourite one in Ayrshire , is evidently the original of Lochaber . In this manner most of our finest more modern airs have had their origin . Some early minstrel , or musical shepherd , composed the simple , artless original air ; which being picked up by the more learned musician , took the improved form it bears . O'ER THE MOOR AMANG THE HEATHER . This song is the composition of a Jean Glover , a girl who was not only a whore , but also a thief ; and in one or other character has visited most of the Correction Houses in the West . She was born I believe in Kilmarnock ,— I took the song down from her singing , as she was strolling through the country , with a sleight-of-hand blackguard . TO THE ROSE-BUD . This song is the composition of a —— Johnson , a joiner in the neighbourhood of Belfast . The tune is by Oswald , altered , evidently , from “ Jockie 's Gray Breeks . ” YON WILD MOSSY MOUNTAINS . This tune is by Oswald . The song alludes to a part of my private history , which it is of no consequence to the world to know . IT IS NA , JEAN , THY BONNIE FACE . These were originally English verses :— I gave them the Scots dress . EPPIE M'NAB . The old song with this title has more wit than decency . WHA IS THAT AT MY BOWER DOOR . This tune is also known by the name of “ Lass an I come near thee . ” The words are mine . THOU ART GANE AWA . This time is the same with “ Haud awa frae me , Donald . ” THE TEARS I SHED MUST EVER FALL . This song of genius was composed by a Miss Cranston . It wanted four lines , to make all the stanzas suit the music , which I added , and are the four first of the last stanza . “ No cold approach , no alter 'd mien , Just what would make suspicion start ; No pause the dire extremes between , He made me blest — and broke my heart ! ” THE BONIE WEE THING . Composed on my little idol “ the charming , lovely Davies . ” THE TITHER MORN . This tune is originally from the Highlands . I have heard a Gaelic song to it , which I was told was very clever , but not by any means a lady 's song . A MOTHER 'S LAMENT FOR THE DEATH OF HER SON . This most beautiful tune is , I think , the happiest composition of that bard-born genius , John Riddel , of the family of Glencarnock , at Ayr . The words were composed to commemorate the much-lamented and premature death of James Ferguson , Esq ., jun . of Craigdarroch . DAINTIE DAVIE . This song , tradition says , and the composition itself confirms it , was composed on the Rev . David Williamson 's begetting the daughter of Lady Cherrytrees with child , while a party of dragoons were searching her house to apprehend him for being an adherent to the solemn league and covenant . The pious woman had put a lady 's night-cap on him , and had laid him a-bed with her own daughter , and passed him to the soldiery as a lady , her daughter 's bed-fellow . A mutilated stanza or two are to be found in Herd 's collection , but the original song consists of five or six stanzas , and were their delicacy equal to their wit and humour , they would merit a place in any collection . The first stanza is “ Being pursued by the dragoons , Within my bed he was laid down ; And weel I wat he was worth his room , For he was my Daintie Davie . ” Ramsay 's song , “ Luckie Nansy , ” though he calls it an old song with additions , seems to be all his own except the chorus : “ I was a telling you , Luckie Nansy , Luckie Nansy Auld springs wad ding the new , But ye wad never trow me . ” Which I should conjecture to be part of a song prior to the affair of Williamson . BOB O ’ DUMBLANE . RAMSAY , as usual , has modernized this song . The original , which I learned on the spot , from my old hostess in the principal inn there , is — “ Lassie , lend me your braw hemp heckle , And I 'll lend you my thripplin-kame ; My heckle is broken , it canna be gotten , And we 'll gae dance the bob o ’ Dumblane . Twa gaed to the wood , to the wood , to the wood . Twa gaed to the wood — three came hame ; An ’ it be na weel bobbit , weel bobbit , weel bobbit An ’ it be na weel bobbit , we 'll bob it again . ” I insert this song to introduce the following anecdote , which I have heard well authenticated . In the evening of the day of the battle of Dumblane , ( Sheriff Muir ,) when the action was over , a Scots officer in Argyll 's army , observed to His Grace , that he was afraid the rebels would give out to the world that they had gotten the victory .— “ Weel , weel , ” returned his Grace , alluding to the foregoing ballad , “ if they think it be nae weel bobbit , we 'll bob it again . ” FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 293 : Fan , when — the dialect of Angus . ] THE BORDER TOUR . Left Edinburgh ( May 6 , 1787 ) — Lammermuir-hills miserably dreary , but at times very picturesque . Lanton-edge , a glorious view of the Merse — Reach Berrywell — old Mr. Ainslie an uncommon character ;— his hobbies , agriculture , natural philosophy , and politics .— In the first he is unexceptionably the clearest-headed , best-informed man I ever met with ; in the other two , very intelligent :— As a man of business he has uncommon merit , and by fairly deserving it has made a very decent independence . Mrs. Ainslie , an excellent , sensible , cheerful , amiable old woman — Miss Ainslie — her person a little embonpoint , but handsome ; her face , particularly her eyes , full of sweetness and good humour — she unites three qualities rarely to be found together ; keen , solid penetration ; sly , witty observation and remark ; and the gentlest , most unaffected female modesty — Douglas , a clever , fine , promising young fellow .— The family-meeting with their brother ; my compagnon de voyage , very charming ; particularly the sister . The whole family remarkably attached to their menials — Mrs. A. full of stories of the sagacity and sense of the little girl in the kitchen .— Mr . A. high in the praises of an African , his house-servant — all his people old in his service — Douglas 's old nurse came to Berrywell yesterday to remind them of its being his birthday . A Mr. Dudgeon , a poet at times ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 294 ]</span>a worthy remarkable character — natural penetration , a great deal of information , some genius , and extreme modesty . Sunday .— Went to church at Dunse<span type="note_anchor">[ 295 ]</span>— Dr. Howmaker a man of strong lungs and pretty judicious remark ; but ill skilled in propriety , and altogether unconscious of his want of it . Monday .— Coldstream — went over to England — Cornhill — glorious river Tweed — clear and majestic — fine bridge . Dine at Coldstream with Mr. Ainslie and Mr. Foreman — beat Mr. F —— in a dispute about Voltaire . Tea at Lenel House with Mr. Brydone — Mr. Brydone a most excellent heart , kind , joyous , and benevolent ; but a good deal of the French indiscriminate complaisance — from his situation past and present , an admirer of everything that bears a splendid title , or that possesses a large estate — Mrs. Brydone a most elegant woman in her person and manners ; the tones of her voice remarkably sweet — my reception extremely flattering — sleep at Coldstream . Tuesday .— Breakfast at Kelso — charming situation of Kelso — fine bridge over the Tweed — enchanting views and prospects on both sides of the river , particularly the Scotch side ; introduced to Mr. Scott of the Royal Bank — an excellent , modest fellow — fine situation of it — ruins of Roxburgh Castle — a holly-bush , growing where James II . of Scotland was accidentally killed by the bursting of a cannon . A small old religious ruin , and a fine old garden planted by the religious , rooted out and destroyed by an English hottentot , a maitre d'hotel of the duke 's , a Mr. Cole — climate and soil of Berwickshire , and even Roxburghshire , superior to Ayrshire — bad roads . Turnip and sheep husbandry , their great improvements — Mr. M'Dowal , at Caverton Mill , a friend of Mr. Ainslie 's , with whom I dined to-day , sold his sheep , ewe and lamb together , at two guineas a piece — wash their sheep before shearing — seven or eight pounds of washen wool in a fleece — low markets , consequently low rents — fine lands not above sixteen shillings a Scotch acre — magnificence of farmers and farm-houses — come up Teviot and up Jed to Jedburgh to lie , and so wish myself a good night . Wednesday .— Breakfast with Mr. —— in Jedburgh — a squabble between Mrs. ——, a crazed , talkative slattern , and a sister of hers , an old maid , respecting a relief minister — Miss gives Madam the lie ; and Madam , by way of revenge , upbraids her that she laid snares to entangle the said minister , then a widower , in the net of matrimony — go about two miles out of Jedburgh to a roup of parks — meet a polite , soldier-like gentleman , a Captain Rutherford , who had been many years through the wilds of America , a prisoner among the Indians — charming , romantic situation of Jedburgh , with gardens , orchards , &amp; c ., intermingled among the houses — fine old ruins — a once magnificent cathedral , and strong castle . All the towns here have the appearance of old , rude grandeur , but the people extremely idle — Jed a fine romantic little river . Dine with Capt . Rutherford — the Captain a polite fellow , fond of money in his farming way ; showed a particular respect to my bardship — his lady exactly a proper matrimonial second part for him . Miss Rutherford a beautiful girl , but too far gone woman to expose so much of a fine swelling bosom — her face very fine . Return to Jedburgh — walk up Jed with some ladies to be shown Love-lane and Blackburn , two fairy scenes . Introduced to Mr. Potts , writer , a very clever fellow ; and Mr. Somerville , the clergyman of the place , a man and a gentleman , but sadly addicted to punning .— The walking party of ladies , Mrs. —— and Miss —— her sister , before mentioned .— N. B . These two appear still more comfortably ugly and stupid , and bore me most shockingly . Two Miss ——, tolerably agreeable . Miss Hope , a tolerably pretty girl , fond of laughing and fun . Miss Lindsay , a good-humoured , amiable girl ; rather short et embonpoint , but handsome , and extremely graceful — beautiful hazel eyes , full of spirit , and sparkling with delicious moisture — an engaging face — un tout ensemble that speaks her of the first order of female minds — her sister , a bonnie , strappan , rosy , sonsie lass . Shake myself loose , after several unsuccessful efforts , of Mrs. —— and Miss ——, and somehow or other , get hold of Miss Lindsay 's arm . My heart is thawed into melting pleasure after being so long frozen up in the Greenland bay of indifference , amid the noise and nonsense of Edinburgh . Miss seems very well pleased with my bardship 's distinguishing her , and after some slight qualms , which I could easily mark , she sets the titter round at defiance , and kindly allows me to keep my hold ; and when parted by the ceremony of my introduction to Mr. Somerville , she met me half , to resume my situation .— Nota Bene — The poet within a point and a half of being d — mnably in love — I am afraid my bosom is still nearly as much tinder as ever . The old cross-grained , whiggish , ugly , slanderous Miss ——, with all the poisonous spleen of a disappointed , ancient maid , stops me very unseasonably to ease her bursting breast , by falling abusively foul on the Miss Lindsays , particularly on my Dulcinea ;— I hardly refrain from cursing her to her face for daring to mouth her calumnious slander on one of the finest pieces of the workmanship of Almighty Excellence ! Sup at Mr. —— ‘ s ; vexed that the Miss Lindsays are not of the supper-party , as they only are wanting . Mrs. —— and Miss —— still improve infernally on my hands . Set out next morning for Wauchope , the seat of my correspondent , Mrs. Scott — breakfast by the way with Dr. Elliot , an agreeable , good-hearted , climate-beaten old veteran , in the medical line ; now retired to a romantic , but rather moorish place , on the banks of the Roole — he accompanies us almost to Wauchope — we traverse the country to the top of Bochester , the scene of an old encampment , and Woolee Hill . Wauchope — Mr. Scott exactly the figure and face commonly given to Sancho Panca — very shrewd in his farming matters , and not unfrequently stumbles on what may be called a strong thing rather than a good thing . Mrs. Scott all the sense , taste , intrepidity of face , and bold , critical decision , which usually distinguish female authors .— Sup with Mr. Potts — agreeable party .— Breakfast next morning with Mr. Somerville — the bruit of Miss Lindsay and my bardship , by means of the invention and malice of Miss ——. Mr. Somerville sends to Dr. Lindsay , begging him and family to breakfast if convenient , but at all events to send Miss Lindsay ; accordingly Miss Lindsay only comes .— I find Miss Lindsay would soon play the devil with me — I met with some little flattering attentions from her . Mrs. Somerville an excellent , motherly , agreeable woman , and a fine family .— Mr . Ainslie , and Mrs. S ——, junrs ., with Mr. ——, Miss Lindsay , and myself , go to see Esther , a very remarkable woman for reciting poetry of all kinds , and sometimes making Scotch doggerel herself — she can repeat by heart almost everything she has ever read , particularly Pope 's Homer from end to end — has studied Euclid by herself , and in short , is a woman of very extraordinary abilities .— On conversing with her I find her fully equal to the character given of her .<span type="note_anchor">[ 296 ]</span>— She is very much flattered that I send for her , and that she sees a poet who has put out a book , as she says .— She is , among other things , a great florist — and is rather past the meridian of once celebrated beauty . I walk in Esther 's garden with Miss Lindsay , and after some little chit-chat of the tender kind , I presented her with a proof print of my Nob , which she accepted with something more tinder than gratitude . She told me many little stories which Miss —— had retailed concerning her and me , with prolonging pleasure — God bless her ! Was waited on by the magistrates , and presented with the freedom of the burgh . Took farewell of Jedburgh , with some melancholy , disagreeable sensations .— Jed , pure be thy crystal streams , and hallowed thy sylvan banks ! Sweet Isabella Lindsay , may peace dwell in thy bosom , uninterrupted , except by the tumultuous throbbings of rapturous love ! That love-kindling eye must beam on another , not on me ; that graceful form must bless another 's arms ; not mine ! Kelso . Dine with the farmers ’ club — all gentlemen , talking of high matters — each of them keeps a hunter from thirty to fifty pounds value , and attends the fox-huntings in the country — go out with Mr. Ker , one of the club , and a friend of Mr. Ainslie 's , to lie — Mr. Ker a most gentlemanly , clever , handsome fellow , a widower with some fine children — his mind and manner astonishingly like my dear old friend Robert Muir , in Kilmarnock — everything in Mr. Ker 's most elegant — he offers to accompany me in my English tour . Dine with Sir Alexander Don — a pretty clever fellow , but far from being a match for his divine lady .— A very wet day * * *— Sleep at Stodrig again ; and set out for Melrose — visit Dryburgh , a fine old ruined abbey — still bad weather — cross Leader , and come up Tweed to Melrose — dine there , and visit that far-famed , glorious ruin — come to Selkirk , up Ettrick ; the whole country hereabout , both on Tweed and Ettrick , remarkably stony . Monday .— Come to Inverleithing , a famous shaw , and in the vicinity of the palace of Traquair , where having dined , and drank some Galloway-whey , I hero remain till to-morrow — saw Elibanks and Elibraes , on the other side of the Tweed . Tuesday .— Drank tea yesternight at Pirn , with Mr . Horseburgh .— Breakfasted to-day with Mr. Ballantyne of Hollowlee — Proposal for a four-horse team to consist of Mr. Scott of Wauchope , Fittieland : Logan of Logan , Fittiefurr : Ballantyne of Hollowlee , Forewynd : Horsburgh of Horsburgh .— Dine at a country inn , kept by a miller , in Earlston , the birth-place and residence of the celebrated Thomas a Rhymer — saw the ruins of his castle — come to Berrywell . Wednesday .— Dine at Dunse with the farmers ’ club-company — impossible to do them justice — Rev . Mr. Smith a famous punster , and Mr. Meikle a celebrated mechanic , and inventor of the threshing-mills . Thursday , breakfast at Berrywell , and walk into Dunse to see a famous knife made by a cutler there , and to be presented to an Italian prince .— A pleasant ride with my friend Mr. Robert Ainslie , and his sister , to Mr. Thomson 's , a man who has newly commenced farmer , and has married a Miss Patty Grieve , formerly a flame of Mr. Robert Ainslie 's .— Company — Miss Jacky Grieve , an amiable sister of Mrs. Thomson 's , and Mr . Hood , an honest , worthy , facetious farmer , in the neighbourhood . Friday .— Ride to Berwick — An idle town , rudely picturesque .— Meet Lord Errol in walking round the walls .— His lordship 's flattering notice of me .— Dine with Mr. Clunzie , merchant — nothing particular in company or conversation — Come up a bold shore , and over a wild country to Eyemouth — sup and sleep at Mr. Grieve 's . Saturday .— Spend the day at Mr. Grieve 's — made a royal arch mason of St. Abb 's Lodge ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 297 ]</span>— Mr. William Grieve , the oldest brother , a joyous , warm-hearted , jolly , clever fellow — takes a hearty glass , and sings a good song .— Mr . Robert , his brother , and partner in trade , a good fellow , but says little . Take a sail after dinner . Fishing of all kinds pays tithes at Eyemouth . Sunday .— A Mr. Robinson , brewer at Ednam , sets out with us to Dunbar . The Miss Grieves very good girls .— My bardship 's heart got a brush from Miss Betsey . Mr. William Grieve 's attachment to the family-circle , so fond , that when he is out , which by the bye is often the case , he cannot go to bed till he see if all his sisters are sleeping well —— Pass the famous Abbey of Coldingham , and Pease-bridge .— Call at Mr. Sheriff 's where Mr. A. and I dine .— Mr . S. talkative and conceited . I talk of love to Nancy the whole evening , while her brother escorts home some companions like himself .— Sir James Hall of Dunglass , having heard of my being in the neighbourhood , comes to Mr. Sheriff 's to breakfast — takes me to see his fine scenery on the stream of Dunglass — Dunglass the most romantic , sweet place I over saw — Sir James and his lady a pleasant happy couple .— He points out a walk for which he has an uncommon respect , as it was made by an aunt of his , to whom he owes much . Miss —— will accompany me to Dunbar , by way of making a parade of me as a sweetheart of hers , among her relations . She mounts an old cart-horse , as huge and as lean as a house ; a rusty old side-saddle without girth , or stirrup , but fastened on with an old pillion-girth — herself as fine as hands could make her , in cream-coloured riding clothes , hat and feather , &amp; c .— I , ashamed of my situation , ride like the devil , and almost shake her to pieces on old Jolly — get rid of her by refusing to call at her uncle 's with her . Past through the most glorious corn-country I ever saw , till I reach Dunbar , a neat little town .— Dine with Provost Fall , an eminent merchant , and most respectable character , but undescribable , as he exhibits no marked traits . Mrs. Fall , a genius in painting ; fully more clever in the fine arts and sciences than my friend Lady Wauchope , without her consummate assurance of her own abilities .— Call with Mr. Robinson ( who , by the bye , I find to be a worthy , much respected man , very modest ; warm , social heart , which with less good sense than his would be perhaps with the children of prim precision and pride , rather inimical to that respect which is man 's due from man ) with him I call on Miss Clarke , a maiden in the Scotch phrase , “ Guid enough , but no brent new : ” a clever woman , with tolerable pretensions to remark and wit ; while time had blown the blushing bud of bashful modesty into the flower of easy confidence . She wanted to see what sort of raree show an author was ; and to let him know , that though Dunbar was but a little town , yet it was not destitute of people of parts . Breakfast next morning at Skateraw , at Mr. Lee 's , a farmer of great note .— Mr . Lee , an excellent , hospitable , social fellow , rather oldish ; warm-hearted and chatty — a most judicious , sensible farmer . Mr. Lee detains me till next morning .— Company at dinner .— My Rev . acquaintance Dr. Bowmaker , a reverend , rattling old fellow .— Two sea lieutenants ; a cousin of the landlord 's , a fellow whose looks are of that kind which deceived me in a gentleman at Kelso , and has often deceived me : a goodly handsome figure and face , which incline one to give them credit for parts which they have not . Mr. Clarke , a much cleverer fellow , but whose looks a little cloudy , and his appearance rather ungainly , with an every-day observer may prejudice the opinion against him .— Dr . Brown , a medical young gentleman from Dunbar , a fellow whose face and manners are open and engaging .— Leave Skateraw for Dunse next day , along with collector ——, a lad of slender abilities and bashfully diffident to an extreme . Found Miss Ainslie , the amiable , the sensible , the good-humoured , the sweet Miss Ainslie , all alone at Berrywell .— Heavenly powers , who know the weakness of human hearts , support mine ! What happiness must I see only to remind me that I cannot enjoy it ! Lammer-muir Hills , from East Lothian to Dunse , very wild .— Dine with the farmer 's club at Kelso . Sir John Hume and Mr. Lumsden there , but nothing worth remembrance when the following circumstance is considered — I walk into Dunse before dinner , and out to Berrywell in the evening with Miss Ainslie — how well-bred , how frank , how good she is ! Charming Rachael ! may thy bosom never be wrung by the evils of this life of sorrows , or by the villany of this world 's sons ! Thursday .— Mr . Ker and I set out to dine at Mr . Hood 's on our way to England . I am taken extremely ill with strong feverish symptoms , and take a servant of Mr . Hood 's to watch me all night — embittering remorse scares my fancy at the gloomy forebodings of death .— I am determined to live for the future in such a manner as not to be scared at the approach of death — I am sure I could meet him with indifference , but for “ The something beyond the grave . ” — Mr . Hood agrees to accompany us to England if we will wait till Sunday . Friday .— I go with Mr . Hood to see a roup of an unfortunate farmer 's stock — rigid economy , and decent industry , do you preserve me from being the principal dramatis persona in such a scene of horror . Meet my good old friend Mr. Ainslie , who calls on Mr . Hood in the evening to take farewell of my bardship . This day I feel myself warm with sentiments of gratitude to the Great Preserver of men , who has kindly restored me to health and strength once more . A pleasant walk with my young friend Douglas Ainslie , a sweet , modest , clever young fellow . Sunday , 27th May .— Cross Tweed , and traverse the moors through a wild country till I reach Alnwick — Alnwick Castle a seat of the Duke of Northumberland , furnished in a most princely manner .— A Mr. Wilkin , agent of His Grace 's , shows us the house and policies . Mr. Wilkin , a discreet , sensible , ingenious man . Monday .— Come , still through by-ways , to Warkworth , where we dine .— Hermitage and old castle . Warkworth situated very picturesque , with Coquet Island , a small rocky spot , the seat of an old monastery , facing it a little in the sea ; and the small but romantic river Coquet , running through it .— Sleep at Morpeth , a pleasant enough little town , and on next day to Newcastle .— Meet with a very agreeable , sensible fellow , a Mr. Chattox , who shows us a great many civilities , and who dines and sups with us . Wednesday .— Left Newcastle early in the morning , and rode over a fine country to Hexham to breakfast — from Hexham to Wardrue , the celebrated Spa , where we slept . Thursday — Reach Longtown to dine , and part there with my good friends Messrs . Hood and Ker — A hiring day in Longtown — I am uncommonly happy to see so many young folks enjoying life .— I come to Carlisle .— ( Meet a strange enough romantic adventure by the way , in falling in with a girl and her married sister — the girl , after some overtures of gallantry on my side , sees me a little cut with the bottle , and offers to take me in for a Gretna-Green affair .— I , not being such a gull , as she imagines , make an appointment with her , by way of vive la bagatelle , to hold a conference on it when we reach town .— I meet her in town and give her a brush of caressing , and a bottle of cider ; but finding herself un peu trompé in her man she sheers off . ) Next day I meet my good friend , Mr. Mitchell , and walk with him round the town and its environs , and through his printing-works , &amp; c .— four or five hundred people employed , many of them women and children .— Dine with Mr. Mitchell , and leave Carlisle .— Come by the coast to Annan .— Overtaken on the way by a curious old fish of a shoemaker , and miner , from Cumberland mines . [ Here the manuscript abruptly terminates . ] FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 294 : The author of that fine song , “ The Maid that tends the Goats . ” ] [ Footnote 295 : “ During the discourse Burns produced a neat impromptu , conveying an elegant compliment to Miss Ainslie . Dr. B. had selected a text of Scripture that contained a heavy denunciation against obstinate sinners . In the course of the sermon Burns observed the young lady turning over the leaves of her Bible , with much earnestness , in search of the text . He took out a slip of paper , and with a pencil wrote the following lines on it , which he immediately presented to her . “ Fair maid , you need not take the hint , Nor idle texts pursue :— ‘ Twas guilty sinners that he meant ,— Not angels such as you . ” Cromek . ] [ Footnote 296 : “ This extraordinary woman then moved in a very humble walk of life :— the wife of a common working gardener .

Burns 's remarkable poetical genius , the encampment unanimously agreed to admit him gratis , and considered themselves honoured by having a man of such shining abilities for one of their companions . ” Extracted from the Minute Book of the Lodge by THOMAS BOWBILL ] THE HIGHLAND TOUR . 25th August , 1787 . I leave Edinburgh for a northern tour , in company with my good friend Mr. Nicol , whose originality of humour promises me much entertainment .— Linlithgow — a fertile improved country — West Lothian . The more elegance and luxury among the farmers , I always observe in equal proportion , the rudeness and stupidity of the peasantry . This remark I have made all over the Lothians , Merse , Roxburgh , &amp; c. For this , among other reasons , I think that a man of romantic taste , a “ Man of Feeling , ” will be better pleased with the poverty , but intelligent minds of the peasantry in Ayrshire ( peasantry they are all below the justice of peace ) than the opulence of a club of Merse farmers , when at the same time , he considers the vandalism of their plough-folks , &amp; c. I carry this idea so far , that an unenclosed , half improven country is to me actually more agreeable , and gives me more pleasure as a prospect , than a country cultivated like a garden .— Soil about Linlithgow light and thin .— The town carries the appearance of rude , decayed grandeur — charmingly rural , retired situation . The old royal palace a tolerably fine , but melancholy ruin — sweetly situated on a small elevation , by the brink of a loch . Shown the room where the beautiful , injured Mary Queen of Scots was born — a pretty good old Gothic church . The infamous stool of repentance standing , in the old Romish way , on a lofty situation . What a poor pimping business is a Presbyterian place of worship ; dirty , narrow , and squalid ; stuck in a corner of old popish grandeur such as Linlithgow , and much more , Melrose ! Ceremony and show , if judiciously thrown in , absolutely necessary for the bulk of mankind , both in religious and civil matters .— Dine .— Go to my friend Smith 's at Avon printfield — find nobody but Mrs. Miller , an agreeable , sensible , modest , good body ; as useful , but not so ornamental as Fielding 's Miss Western — not rigidly polite à la Français , but easy , hospitable , and housewifely . An old lady from Paisley , a Mrs. Lawson , whom I promised to call for in Paisley — like old lady W ——, and still more like Mrs. C ——, her conversation is pregnant with strong sense and just remark , but like them , a certain air of self-importance and a duresse in the eye , seem to indicate , as the Ayrshire wife observed of her cow , that “ she had a mind o ’ her ain . ” Pleasant view of Dunfermline and the rest of the fertile coast of Fife , as we go down to that dirty , ugly place , Borrowstones — see a horse-race and call on a friend of Mr. Nicol 's , a Bailie Cowan , of whom I know too little to attempt his portrait — Come through the rich carse of Falkirk to pass the night . Falkirk nothing remarkable except the tomb of Sir John the Graham , over which , in the succession of time , four stones have been placed .— Camelon , the ancient metropolis of the Picts , now a small village in the neighbourhood of Falkirk .— Cross the grand canal to Carron .— Come past Larbert and admire a fine monument of cast-iron erected by Mr. Bruce , the African traveller , to his wife . Pass Dunipace , a place laid out with fine taste — a charming amphitheatre bounded by Denny village , and pleasant seats down the way to Dunnipace .— The Carron running down the bosom of the whole makes it one of the most charming little prospects I have seen . Dine at Auchinbowie — Mr. Monro an excellent , worthy old man — Miss Monro an amiable , sensible , sweet young woman , much resembling Mrs. Grierson . Come to Bannockburn — Shown the old house where James III . finished so tragically his unfortunate life . The field of Bannockburn — the hole where glorious Bruce set his standard . Here no Scot can pass uninterested .— I fancy to myself that I see my gallant , heroic countrymen coming o'er the hill and down upon the plunderers of their country , the murderers of their fathers ; noble revenge , and just hate , glowing in every vein , striding more and more eagerly as they approach the oppressive , insulting , blood-thirsty foe ! I see them meet in gloriously triumphant congratulation on the victorious field , exulting in their heroic royal leader , and rescued liberty and independence ! Come to Stirling .— Monday go to Harvieston . Go to see Caudron linn , and Rumbling brig , and Diel 's mill . Return in the evening . Supper — Messrs. Doig , the schoolmaster ; Bell ; and Captain Forrester of the castle — Doig a queerish figure , and something of a pedant — Bell a joyous fellow , who sings a good song .— Forrester a merry , swearing kind of man , with a dash of the sodger . Tuesday Morning .— Breakfast with Captain Forrester — Ochel Hills — Devon River — Forth and Tieth — Allan River — Strathallan , a fine country , but little improved — Cross Earn to Crieff — Dine and go to Arbruchil — cold reception at Arbruchil — a most romantically pleasant ride up Earn , by Auchtertyre and Comrie to Arbruchil — Sup at Crieff . Wednesday Morning .— Leave Crieff — Glen Amond — Amond river — Ossian 's grave — Loch Fruoch — Glenquaich — Landlord and landlady remarkable characters — Taymouth described in rhyme — Meet the Hon . Charles Townshend . Thursday .— Come down Tay to Dunkeld — Glenlyon House — Lyon River — Druid 's Temple — three circles of stones — the outer-most sunk — the second has thirteen stones remaining — the innermost has eight — two large detached ones like a gate , to the south-east — Say prayers in it — Pass Taybridge — Aberfeldy — described in rhyme — Castle Menzies — Inver — Dr. Stewart — sup . Friday .— Walk with Mrs. Stewart and Beard to Birnam top — fine prospect down Tay — Craigieburn hills — Hermitage on the Branwater , with a picture of Ossian — Breakfast with Dr. Stewart — Neil Gow<span type="note_anchor">[ 298 ]</span>plays — a short , stout-built , honest Highland figure , with his grayish hair shed on his honest social brow — an interesting face , marking strong sense , kind openheartedness , mixed with unmistrusting simplicity — visit his house — Marget Gow . Ride up Tummel River to Blair — Fascally a beautiful romantic nest — wild grandeur of the pass of Gilliecrankie — visit the gallant Lord Dundee 's stone . Blair — Sup with the Duchess — easy and happy from the manners of the family — confirmed in my good opinion of my friend Walker . Saturday .— Visit the scenes round Blair — fine , but spoiled with bad taste — Tilt and Gairie rivers — Falls on the Tilt — Heather seat — Ride in company with Sir William Murray and Mr. Walker , to Loch Tummel — meanderings of the Rannach , which runs through quondam Struan Robertson 's estate from Loch Rannach to Loch Tummel — Dine at Blair — Company — General Murray — Captain Murray , an honest tar — Sir William Murray , an honest , worthy man , but tormented with the hypochondria — Mrs. Graham , belle et aimable — Miss Catchcart — Mrs. Murray , a painter — Mrs. King — Duchess and fine family , the Marquis , Lords James , Edward , and Robert — Ladies Charlotte , Emilia , and children dance — Sup — Mr. Graham of Fintray . Come up the Garrie — Falls of Bruar — Daldecairoch — Dalwhinnie — Dine — Snow on the hills 17 feet deep — No corn from Loch-Gairie to Dalwhinnie — Cross the Spey , and come down the stream to Pitnin — Straths rich — les environs picturesque — Craigow hill — Ruthven of Badenoch — Barracks — wild and magnificent — Rothemurche on the other side , and Glenmore — Grant of Rothemurche 's poetry — told me by the Duke of Gordon — Strathspey , rich and romantic — Breakfast at Aviemore , a wild spot — dine at Sir James Grant 's — Lady Grant , a sweet , pleasant body — come through mist and darkness to Dulsie , to lie .

Wednesday .— Loch Ness — Braes of Ness — General 's hut — Falls of Fyers — Urquhart Castle and Strath . Thursday .— Come over Culloden Muir — reflections on the field of battle — breakfast at Kilravock — old Mrs. Rose , sterling sense , warm heart , strong passions , and honest pride , all in an uncommon degree — Mrs. Rose , jun ., a little milder than the mother — this perhaps owing to her being younger — Mr. Grant , minister at Calder , resembles Mr. Scott at Inverleithing — Mrs. Rose and Mrs. Grant accompany us to Kildrummie — two young ladies — Miss Rose , who sung two Gaelic songs , beautiful and lovely — Miss Sophia Brodie , most agreeable and amiable — both of them gentle , mild ; the sweetest creatures on earth , and happiness be with them !— Dine at Nairn — fall in with a pleasant enough gentleman , Dr. Stewart , who had been long abroad with his father in the forty-five ; and Mr. Falconer , a spare , irascible , warm-hearted Norland , and a nonjuror — Brodie-house to lie .

FOOTNOTES : [ Footnote 298 : Another northern bard has sketched this eminent musician — “ The blythe Strathspey springs up , reminding some Of nights when Gow 's old arm , ( nor old the tale ,) Unceasing , save when reeking cans went round , Made heart and heel leap light as bounding roe . Alas ! no more shall we behold that look So venerable , yet so blent with mirth , And festive joy sedate ; that ancient garb Unvaried ,— tartan hose , and bonnet blue ! No more shall Beauty 's partial eye draw forth The full intoxication of his strain . Mellifluous , strong , exuberantly rich ! No more , amid the pauses of the dance , Shall he repeat those measures , that in days Of other years , could soothe a falling prince , And light his visage with a transient smile Of melancholy joy ,— like autumn sun Gilding a sear tree with a passing beam ! Or play to sportive children on the green Dancing at gloamin hour ; or willing cheer With strains unbought , the shepherd 's bridal day . ” British Georgics , p. 81 ] THE POET 'S ASSIGNMENT OF HIS WORKS .
