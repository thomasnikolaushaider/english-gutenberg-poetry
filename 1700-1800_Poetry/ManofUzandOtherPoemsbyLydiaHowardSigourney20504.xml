    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The arrogance of attempting a parody on the most ancient and sublime poem in the Inspired Volume , is not mine . The great pleasure enjoyed in its perusal from early years , had occasionally prompted metrical imitations of isolated passages . These fragmentary effusions , recently woven together , are here presented , with the hope that as wandering streams are traced to their original fountain , some heart may thus be led to the history of the stricken and sustained Patriarch , with more studious research , purer delight , or a deeper spirit of devotion .</p>

    <head>THE MAN OF UZ .</head>
    <head>A JOYOUS FESTIVAL .— The gathering back Of scattered flowrets to the household wreath . Brothers and sisters from their sever 'd homes Meeting with ardent smile , to renovate The love that sprang from cradle memories And childhood 's sports , and whose perennial stream Still threw fresh crystals o'er the sands of life . — Each bore some treasured picture of the past , Some graphic incident , by mellowing time Made beautiful , while ever and anon , Timbrel and harp broke forth , each pause between . Banquet and wine-cup , and the dance , gave speed To youthful spirits , and prolong 'd the joy .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The patriarch father , with a chasten 'd heart</l>
     <l n="2">Partook his children 's mirth , having God 's fear</l>
     <l n="3">Ever before him . Earnestly he brought</l>
     <l n="4">His offerings and his prayers for every one</l>
     <l n="5">Of that beloved group , lest in the swell</l>
     <l n="6">And surging superflux of happiness</l>
     <l n="7">They might forget the Hand from whence it came ,</l>
     <l n="8">Perchance , displease the Almighty .</l>
     <l n="9">Many a care</l>
     <l n="10">Had he that wealth creates . Not such as lurks</l>
     <l n="11">In heaps metallic , which the rust corrodes ,</l>
     <l n="12">But wealth that fructifies within the earth</l>
     <l n="13">Whence cometh bread , or o'er its surface roves</l>
     <l n="14">In peaceful forms of quadrupedal life</l>
     <l n="15">That thronging round the world 's first father came</l>
     <l n="16">To take their names , ‘ mid Eden 's tranquil shades ,</l>
     <l n="17">Ere sin was born .</l>
     <l n="18">Obedient to the yoke ,</l>
     <l n="19">Five hundred oxen turn 'd the furrow 'd glebe</l>
     <l n="20">Where agriculture hides his buried seed</l>
     <l n="21">Waiting the harvest hope , while patient wrought</l>
     <l n="22">An equal number of that race who share</l>
     <l n="23">The labor of the steed , without his praise .</l>
     <l n="24">— Three thousand camels , with their arching necks ,</l>
     <l n="25">Ships of the desert , knelt to do his will ,</l>
     <l n="26">And bear his surplus wealth to distant climes ,</l>
     <l n="27">While more than twice three thousand snowy sheep</l>
     <l n="28">Whitened the hills . Troops of retainers fed</l>
     <l n="29">These flocks and herds , and their subsistence drew</l>
     <l n="30">From the same lord ,— so that this man of Uz</l>
     <l n="31">Greater than all the magnates of the east ,</l>
     <l n="32">Dwelt in old time before us .</l>
     <l n="33">True he gave ,</l>
     <l n="34">And faithfully , the hireling his reward ,</l>
     <l n="35">Counting such justice ‘ mid the happier forms</l>
     <l n="36">Of Charity , which with a liberal hand</l>
     <l n="37">He to the sad and suffering poor dispensed .</l>
     <l n="38">Eyes was he to the blind , and to the lame</l>
     <l n="39">Feet , while the stranger and the traveller found</l>
     <l n="40">Beneath , the welcome shelter of his roof</l>
     <l n="41">The blessed boon of hospitality .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="42">To him the fatherless and widow sought</l>
     <l n="43">For aid and counsel . Fearlessly he rose</l>
     <l n="44">For those who had no helper . His just mind</l>
     <l n="45">Brought stifled truth to light , disarm 'd the wiles</l>
     <l n="46">Of power , and gave deliverance to the weak .</l>
     <l n="47">He pluck 'd the victim from the oppressor 's grasp ,</l>
     <l n="48">And made the tyrant tremble .</l>
     <l n="49">To his words</l>
     <l n="50">Men listened , as to lore oracular ,</l>
     <l n="51">And when beside the gate he took his seat</l>
     <l n="52">The young kept silence , and the old rose up</l>
     <l n="53">To do him honor . After his decree</l>
     <l n="54">None spake again , for as a prince he dwelt</l>
     <l n="55">Wearing the diadem of righteousness ,</l>
     <l n="56">And robed in that respect which greatness wins</l>
     <l n="57">When leagued with goodness , and by wisdom crown 'd .</l>
     <l n="58">The grateful prayers and blessings of the souls</l>
     <l n="59">Ready to perish , silently distill 'd</l>
     <l n="60">Upon him , as he slept .</l>
     <l n="61">So as a tree</l>
     <l n="62">Whose root is by the river 's brink , he grew</l>
     <l n="63">And flourish 'd , while the dews like balm-drops hung</l>
     <l n="64">All night upon his branches .</l>
     <l n="65">Yet let none</l>
     <l n="66">Of woman born , presume to build his hopes</l>
     <l n="67">On the worn cliff of brief prosperity ,</l>
     <l n="68">Or from the present promise , predicate</l>
     <l n="69">The future joy . The exulting bird that sings</l>
     <l n="70">Mid the green curtains of its leafy nest</l>
     <l n="71">His tuneful trust untroubled there to live ,</l>
     <l n="72">And there to die , may meet the archer 's shaft</l>
     <l n="73">When next it spreads the wing .</l>
     <l n="74">The tempest folds</l>
     <l n="75">O'er the smooth forehead of the summer noon</l>
     <l n="76">Its undiscover 'd purpose , to emerge</l>
     <l n="77">Resistless from its armory , and whelm</l>
     <l n="78">In floods of ruin , ere the day decline .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="79">Lightning and sword !</l>
     <l n="80">Swift messengers , and sharp ,</l>
     <l n="81">Reapers that leave no gleanings . In their path</l>
     <l n="82">Silence and desolation fiercely stalk .</l>
     <l n="83">— O'er trampled hills , and on the blood-stain 'd plains</l>
     <l n="84">There is no low of kine , or bleat of flocks ,</l>
     <l n="85">The fields are rifled , and the shepherds slain .</l>

     <l n="86">The Man of Uz , who stood but yestermorn</l>
     <l n="87">Above all compeers ,— clothed with wealth and power ,</l>
     <l n="88">To day is poorer than his humblest hind .</l>
     <l n="89">A whirlwind from the desert !</l>
     <l n="90">All unwarn 'd</l>
     <l n="91">Its fury came . Earth like a vassal shook .</l>
     <l n="92">Majestic trees flew hurtling through the air</l>
     <l n="93">Like rootless reeds .</l>
     <l n="94">There was no time for flight .</l>
     <l n="95">Buried in household wrecks , all helpless lay</l>
     <l n="96">Masses of quivering life .</l>
     <l n="97">Job 's eldest son</l>
     <l n="98">That day held banquet for their numerous line</l>
     <l n="99">At his own house . With revelry and song ,</l>
     <l n="100">One moment in the glow of kindred hearts</l>
     <l n="101">The lordly mansion rang , the next they lay</l>
     <l n="102">Crush 'd neath its ruins .</l>
     <l n="103">He ,— the childless sire ,</l>
     <l n="104">Last of his race , and lonely as the pine</l>
     <l n="105">That crisps and blackens ‘ neath the lightning shaft</l>
     <l n="106">Upon the cliff , with such a rushing tide</l>
     <l n="107">The mountain billows of his misery came ,</l>
     <l n="108">Drove they not Reason from her beacon-hold ?</l>
     <l n="109">Swept they not his strong trust in Heaven away ?</l>

     <l n="113">Oh Patriarch !— teach us , mid this changeful life</l>
     <l n="114">Not to mistake the ownership of joys</l>
     <l n="115">Entrusted to us for a little while ,</l>
     <l n="116">But when the Great Dispenser shall reclaim</l>
     <l n="117">His loans , to render them with praises back ,</l>
     <l n="118">As best befits the indebted .</l>

     <l n="126">The chasm between us , and our smitten joys</l>
     <l n="127">And saps the strength wherewith at first we went</l>
     <l n="128">Into life 's battle . We perchance , have dream 'd</l>

     <l n="130">The prattle of the babe the Spoiler seiz 'd ,</l>
     <l n="131">Had but gone from us for a little while ,—</l>

     <l n="135">To extasy ,— till iron-handed Grief</l>
     <l n="136">Press 'd down the nevermore into our soul ,</l>
     <l n="137">Deadening us with its weight .</l>
     <l n="138">The man of Uz</l>
     <l n="139">As the slow lapse of days and nights reveal 'd</l>
     <l n="140">The desolation of his poverty</l>
     <l n="141">Felt every nerve that at the first great shock</l>
     <l n="142">Was paralyzed , grow sensitive and shrink</l>
     <l n="143">As from a fresh-cut wound . There was no son</l>
     <l n="144">To come in beauty of his manly prime</l>
     <l n="145">With words of counsel and with vigorous hand</l>
     <l n="146">To aid him in his need , no daughter 's arm</l>
     <l n="147">To twine around him in his weariness ,</l>
     <l n="148">Nor kiss of grandchild at the even-tide</l>
     <l n="149">Going to rest , with prayer upon its lips .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="150">Still a new trial waits .</l>

     <l n="152">Heaven 's boon , thro ’ which with unbow 'd form we bear</l>
     <l n="153">Burdens and ills , forsook him . Maladies</l>

     <l n="155">His swollen limbs . Incessant , grinding pains</l>
     <l n="156">Laid his strength prostrate , till he counted life</l>
     <l n="157">A loathed thing . Dire visions frighted sleep</l>
     <l n="158">That sweet restorer of the wasted frame ,</l>
     <l n="159">And mid his tossings to and fro , he moan 'd</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="161">Despondence seized him . To the lowliest place</l>

     <l n="164">She , his bosom friend</l>
     <l n="165">The sharer of his lot for many years ,</l>
     <l n="166">Sought out his dark retreat . Shuddering she saw</l>
     <l n="167">His kingly form like living sepulchre ,</l>
     <l n="168">And in the maddening haste of sorrow said</l>
     <l n="169">God hath forgotten .</l>
     <l n="170">She with him had borne</l>
     <l n="171">Unuttered woe o'er the untimely graves</l>
     <l n="172">Of all whom she had nourished ,— shared with him</l>

     <l n="889">As one to right their wrongs , and pluck the spoil</l>

     <l n="1154">Into the battle . At the trumpet 's sound ,</l>
     <l n="1155">And shouting of the captains , he exults ,</l>

     <l n="1157">Into his fearless spirit .</l>
     <l n="1158">Doth the Hawk</l>

   <p>THE RURAL LIFE IN NEW-ENGLAND .</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION .</p>
   <p>It may be thought that the following poem , especially its opening Canto is too minute and circumstantial in its descriptions . Yet the habitudes of a past and peculiar generation , fast fading from remembrance , are worthy of being preserved , though little accordant with romance , perhaps with poetry . So rapid has been our progress as a people , that dimness gathers over the lineaments of even our immediate ancestry . Yet traits at one period despised , or counted obsolete , may at another be diligently sought after and re-juvenated .</p>
   <p>It has been observed that nations reaching their zenith , regard with more complacency their rising morn , than the approaching west . France , notwithstanding the precision given to her language by Richilieu , and the Academy , turns back affectionately to her Troubadours and Trouvires , to the long-drawn , scarce-readable “ Romance of the Rose , ” and the itinerant Chronicles of Froissart . England is not indifferent to Anglo-Saxon traditions , or the customs of her Norman dynasty .</p>
   <p>A time may arrive when our posterity will not scorn to be reminded of the primitive usages of their rural fathers . To that time , and to unborn readers , this simple poem is dedicated .</p>

    <head>THE RURAL LIFE IN NEW-ENGLAND .</head>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>CANTO FIRST .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="1">
      <l n="1">Peaceful is the rural life , made strong by healthful industry ,</l>
      <l n="2">Firm in love of the birth-land , and the laws that govern it ,</l>
      <l n="3">Calm through moderated desires and a primitive simplicity ,</l>
      <l n="4">Walking filially with Nature as the Patriarchs walked with God .</l>
      <l n="5">Such have I beheld it in my native vales , green and elm-shaded .</l>
      <l n="6">Such hath it been depicted in their legends who went before me ;</l>
      <l n="7">What therefore , I have seen and heard , declare I unto you</l>
      <l n="8">In measures artless and untuneful .</l>
      <l n="9">Fearless of hardship ,</l>
      <l n="10">In costume , as in manners , unadorn 'd and homely</l>
      <l n="11">Were our ancestral farmers , the seed-planters of a strong nation .</l>
      <l n="12">Congenial were their wives , not ashamed of the household charge ,</l>
      <l n="13">Yoke-fellows that were help-meets , vigorous and of a good courage ;</l>
      <l n="14">Revolting not at life 's plain intent , but its duties discharging</l>
      <l n="15">Patiently , lovingly , and with true faith looking upward .</l>
      <l n="16">Thence came the rudiments of an inflexible people</l>
      <l n="17">Whose praise is in themselves .</l>
      <l n="18">Hail to the ancient farmer !</l>
      <l n="19">Broad-shouldered as Ajax — deep-chested through commerce with free air ,</l>
      <l n="20">Not enervated by luxury , nor care-worn with gold-counting ,</l>
      <l n="21">Content with his lot , by pride and envy unvisited .</l>
      <l n="22">Muscular was his arm , laying low the kings of the forest ,</l>
      <l n="23">Uncouth might be his coat , and his heavy shoes , Vestris flouted ,</l>
      <l n="24">At the grasp of his huge hand , the dainty belle might have shuddered .</l>
      <l n="25">Yet blessings on his bronzed face , and his warm , honest heart ,</l>
      <l n="26">Whose well-rooted virtues were the strength and stay of republics .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="27">True independence was his , earth and sky being his bankers ,</l>
      <l n="28">Bills drawn on them , endorsed by toil were never protested .</l>
      <l n="29">Bathed in vernal dews was his glistening plough-share ,</l>
      <l n="30">Birds , newly-returned , the merry nest-builders , bade him good morrow ,</l>
      <l n="31">Keenly wrought his scythe in summer , where fell the odorous clover ,</l>
      <l n="32">Clear was his song at autumn-husking , amid piles of golden corn .</l>
      <l n="33">Winter saw him battling the drifted snows , with his oxen ,</l>
      <l n="34">Bearing to the neighboring town , fuel that gladden 'd the hearth-stone .</l>
      <l n="35">Deep in undisturbed beds then slept the dark-featured anthracite ,</l>
      <l n="36">Steam not having armed itself to exterminate the groves ,</l>
      <l n="37">Lavishly offering them as a holocaust to winged horses of iron ,</l>
      <l n="38">Like Moloch , cruel god , dooming the beautiful to the flame .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="39">Independent was the farmer , the food of his household being sure ;</l>
      <l n="40">With the fields of waving grain ; with the towering tassell 'd maize ;</l>
      <l n="41">With the herds , moving homeward , bearing their creamy nectar ;</l>
      <l n="42">He saw , and gather 'd it , giving thanks to the bountiful Father .</l>
      <l n="43">Among the lambs sporting in green pastures , among the feathery people ,</l>
      <l n="44">Among the fruit-laden branches , he beheld it also ;</l>
      <l n="45">Under the earth , on the earth , in the air , ripen 'd his threefold crop .</l>
      <l n="46">Swelling in the cluster 'd vine , and the roots of the teeming garden ,</l>
      <l n="47">The Garden — precious spot ! which God deign 'd to bless at the beginning ,</l>
      <l n="48">Placing therein Man , made after his own glorious image ,</l>
      <l n="49">To dress it and to keep it .</l>
      <l n="50">Hail , to the ancient farmer ,</l>
      <l n="51">Naught to him the fall of stocks that turns pale the speculator ,</l>
      <l n="52">Naught to him the changes of trade , wrinkling the brow of the merchant ,</l>
      <l n="53">Naught to him , the light weight , or exorbitant price of the baker ;</l>
      <l n="54">Sure was his bread , howsoe'er the markets might fluctuate ,</l>
      <l n="55">Sweet loaves of a rich brown , plentifully graced his table ,</l>
      <l n="56">Made by the neat hand of wife or daughter , happy in healthful toil .</l>
      <l n="57">Skilfully wrought the same hands , amid the treasures of the dairy ,</l>
      <l n="58">Rich cheeses , and masses of golden butter , and bowls of fragrant milk</l>
      <l n="59">Not doled out warily , as by city dames , but to all , free and flowing ;</l>
      <l n="60">Woman 's right it was , to crown the board with gifts of her own</l>
      <l n="61">preparing ;</l>
      <l n="62">Rights not disputed , not clamored for in public assemblies ,</l>
      <l n="63">But conceded by approving Love , whose manliness threw around her</l>
      <l n="64">A cherishing protection , such as God willed in Paradise .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="65">Dense was the head of the Maple , and in summer of a lustrous green ,</l>
      <l n="66">Yet earliest in autumn , among all trees of the forest ,</l>
      <l n="67">To robe itself in scarlet , like a cardinal going to conclave .</l>
      <l n="68">Subjected was it in spring , to a singular phlebetomy ;</l>
      <l n="69">Tubes inserted through its bark , drew away the heart 's sweet blood ,</l>
      <l n="70">Pore after pore emptying itself , till the great arteries were</l>
      <l n="71">exhausted .</l>
      <l n="72">Fires then blazed amid the thickets , like the moveable camp of the</l>
      <l n="73">gipsies ,</l>
      <l n="74">And in boiling kettles , fiercely eddying , struggled the caloric ,</l>
      <l n="75">With gases , and the saccharine spirit , until the granulated sugar ,</l>
      <l n="76">Showed a calm , brown face , welcome to the stores of the housewife ;</l>
      <l n="77">Moulded also into small cakes , it formed the favorite confection</l>
      <l n="78">Of maiden and swain , during the long evenings of courtship .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="79">Gamboling among wild flowers , gadded the honey-bee ,</l>
      <l n="80">Bending down their innocent heads , with a buzzing lore of flattery ,</l>
      <l n="81">Beguiling them of their essences , which with tireless alacrity ,</l>
      <l n="82">Straightway deposited he in his cone-roof 'd banking-house ,</l>
      <l n="83">Subtle financier — thinking to take both dividend and capital .</l>
      <l n="84">But failing in his usury , for duly cometh the farmer ,</l>
      <l n="85">Despoiling him of his hoard , yea ! haply of his life also .</l>
      <l n="86">Stern was the policy of the olden times , to that diligent insect ,</l>

     <l n="2">I saw a brilliant bridal .</l>
     <l n="3">All that cheers</l>
     <l n="4">And charms the leaping heart of youth was there ;</l>
     <l n="5">And she , the central object of the group ,</l>
     <l n="6">The cherished song-bird of her father 's house ,</l>
     <l n="7">Array 'd in beauty , was the loved of all .</l>
     <l n="8">Would I could tell you what a world of flowers</l>
     <l n="9">Were concentrated there — how they o'erflow ' d</l>
     <l n="10">In wreaths and clusters — how they climb 'd and swept</l>
     <l n="11">From vase to ceiling , with their gay festoons</l>
     <l n="12">Whispering each other in their mystic lore</l>
     <l n="13">Of fragrance , and consulting how to swell ,</l>
     <l n="14">As best they might , the tide of happiness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">A few brief moons departed and I sought</l>
     <l n="16">The same abode . There was a gather 'd throng</l>
     <l n="17">Beyond the threshold stone . A few white flowers</l>
     <l n="18">Crept o'er a bosom and a gentle hand</l>
     <l n="19">That clasp 'd them not . A holy hymn awoke</l>
     <l n="20">In plaintive melody ; but she who breath 'd</l>
     <l n="21">The very soul of music from her birth ,</l>
     <l n="22">Lay there with close-seal 'd lips .</l>
     <l n="23">And the same voice</l>
     <l n="24">That in the flushing of the autumnal rose</l>
     <l n="25">Gladly pronounced the irrevocable words</l>
     <l n="26">“ What God hath join 'd together let no man</l>
     <l n="27">Asunder put , ” now , in the chasten 'd tones</l>
     <l n="28">Of deep humility and tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="29">Strove , from the armory of Heaven , to gird</l>
     <l n="30">The hearts that freshly bled .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">At close of day ,</l>
     <l n="32">In the lone , sadden 'd hour of musing thought ,</l>
     <l n="33">I seem 'd to view a scene where , side by side ,</l>
     <l n="34">Bridals and burials gleam 'd — the smile and tear —</l>
     <l n="35">Anguish and joy — peace in her heavenly vest ,</l>
     <l n="36">And brazen-throated war — and heard a cry ,</l>
     <l n="37">“ Such is man 's life below . ”</l>
     <l n="38">I would have wept ,</l>
     <l n="39">Save that a symphony of harps unseen</l>
     <l n="40">Broke from a hovering cloud ; “ Lo ! we are they</l>
     <l n="41">Who from earth 's tribulation rose and found</l>
     <l n="42">Our robes made white . Henceforth we grieve no more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="43">List ! List ! She mingleth in that raptur 'd strain</l>
     <l n="44">Who said so sweetly to her spirit'shYpppHeNguide ,</l>
     <l n="45">That the dear Lord whom she had early serv 'd</l>
     <l n="46">Stood near in her extremity , and gave</l>
     <l n="47">Her soul full willingness to leave a world</l>
     <l n="48">All bright with beauty , and requited love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="49">And so Death lost his victory , tho ’ he snatched</l>
     <l n="50">The unwither 'd garland out of Hymen 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="51">And wound it in cold mockery round the tomb .</l>

     <l n="2">She found a painless avenue to make</l>
     <l n="3">The great transition from a world of care</l>
     <l n="4">To one of rest .</l>
     <l n="5">It was the Sabbath day ,</l>
     <l n="6">And beautiful with smile of vernal sun</l>
     <l n="7">And the up-springing fragrance from the earth ,</l>
     <l n="8">With all that soothing quietude which links</l>
     <l n="9">The consecrated season unto Him</l>
     <l n="10">Who bade the creatures He had made , revere</l>
     <l n="11">And keep it holy .</l>
     <l n="12">From her fair abode ,</l>
     <l n="13">Lovely with early flowers , she took her way</l>
     <l n="14">The second time , unto the House of God ,</l>
     <l n="15">And side by side with her life 's chosen friend</l>
     <l n="16">Walk 'd cheerfully . Within those hallow 'd courts ,</l>
     <l n="17">Where holds the soul communion with its God ,</l>
     <l n="18">She listening sate .</l>
     <l n="19">But then she lean 'd her head</l>
     <l n="20">Upon her husband 's shoulder , and unmark 'd</l>
     <l n="21">By one distorted feature , by the loss</l>
     <l n="22">Or blanching of the rose-tint on her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="23">Rose to more perfect worship .</l>
     <l n="24">It might seem</l>
     <l n="25">As if a sacred temple , purified</l>
     <l n="26">By prayers and praises , were a place sublime ,</l>
     <l n="27">Of fitting sanctity , wherein to hear</l>
     <l n="28">The inexpressive call that summoneth</l>
     <l n="29">The ready spirit upward .</l>
     <l n="30">But the change</l>
     <l n="31">In her delightful home , what words can tell !</l>
     <l n="32">The shock and contrast , when a mind so skill 'd</l>
     <l n="33">With order and efficiency to fill</l>
     <l n="34">Each post of woman 's duty and of love ,</l>
     <l n="35">Vanished from all its daily ministries ,</l>
     <l n="36">And the lone daughter found the guiding voice</l>
     <l n="37">Silent forevermore .</l>
     <l n="38">Her 's was the heart</l>
     <l n="39">For an unswerving friendship , warm and true ,</l>
     <l n="40">And self-forgetful ; her 's the liberal hand</l>
     <l n="41">To those who pine in cells of poverty ,</l>
     <l n="42">The knowledge of their state , the will to aid ,</l>
     <l n="43">The thought that cared for them , the zeal that blest .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="44">Hence , tears o'er rugged cheeks fell fast for her ,</l>
     <l n="45">And the old white-hair 'd pensioner knelt down</l>
     <l n="46">Beside her lifeless clay and cross 'd himself ,</l>
     <l n="47">And pour 'd his desolate prayer ; for her kind heart</l>
     <l n="48">Saw in the creed of varying sects no bar</l>
     <l n="49">To charity , but in their time of need</l>
     <l n="50">Held all as brethren .</l>
     <l n="51">‘ Twas a pleasant spot ,</l>
     <l n="52">Amid fresh verdure , where they laid her down ,</l>
     <l n="53">While the young plants that o'er a daughter 's grave</l>
     <l n="54">Took summer-rooting seemed in haste to reach</l>
     <l n="55">Forth their incipient roots and tendrils green</l>
     <l n="56">To broider her turf-pillow .</l>
     <l n="57">Sleep in peace ,</l>
     <l n="58">Ye , whom the ties of nature closely bound ,</l>
     <l n="59">And death disparted for a little while ,</l>
     <l n="60">Mother and gentle daughter , sleep in peace ;</l>
     <l n="61">Your forms engraven deep on loving hearts ,</l>
     <l n="62">As with a diamond 's point , till memory fade .</l>

Robinson , the only child of Governor and Mrs. Trumbull , whose early life had been a scene of singularly unbroken felicity , was appointed to a fearful contrast of rapid and severe bereavements . Her noble husband , Lucius F. Robinson , Esq ., in the midst of his days and usefulness , was suddenly smitten ,— immediately after , their beautiful child , Annie Seymour ,— then her distinguished relative , Chief Justice Storrs , who from her birth had regarded her with a fatherly love ; and then both her parents , side by side , almost hand in hand , passed to the tomb .</p>
   <p>With unsurpassed calmness , she met this whelming tide of sorrow , girding herself to her maternal duties , in tho armor of a disciple of Jesus Christ . Yet with little warning , she was herself soon summoned to follow those beloved ones , dying in August , 1862 , at the age of 35 , leaving three orphan daughters , and a large circle of friends to lament the loss of her beautiful example of every christian grace and virtue .</p>

     <l n="9">The childless parents weep their broken trust ,</l>

     <l n="17">Not for His reasons let us dare to ask ,</l>

     <l n="20">And make His will our solace and our creed .</l>
