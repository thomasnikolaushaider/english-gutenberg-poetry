   <p>THE LION 'S MASQUERADE . [ p 3 ]</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As Aurora stept forth from the gates of the East ,</l>
     <l n="2">With her garland of roses , and dew-spangled vest ,</l>
     <l n="3">A clamour unusual assaulted her ear ,</l>
     <l n="4">Instead of the Lark , and her friend Chanticleer ,</l>
     <l n="5">At least though their voices she sometimes could trace ,</l>
     <l n="6">They seem 'd overpower 'd by the whole feather 'd race :</l>
     <l n="7">And such was the chirping , and fluttering then ,</l>
     <l n="8">It rouz 'd an old Lion asleep in his den ;</l>
     <l n="9">Enrag 'd at this racket so much out of season , [ p 4 ]</l>
     <l n="10">He , roaring , sent out to ask what was the reason ,</l>
     <l n="11">And the Jackal soon learnt from some stragglers about ,</l>
     <l n="12">‘ Twas the company come from Sir Argus 's rout .</l>
     <l n="13">The gay feather 'd people pursuing their flight ,</l>
     <l n="14">Were soon out of hearing , and soon out of sight .</l>
     <l n="15">But the King of the Quadrupeds vainly sought rest ,</l>
     <l n="16">For something like envy had poison 'd his breast .</l>
     <l n="17">What then were his feelings the following day ,</l>
     <l n="18">When every creature he met on his way ,</l>
     <l n="19">Could talk about nothing , both early and late ,</l>
     <l n="20">But the Peacock 's most sumptuous , and elegant fete .</l>
     <l n="21">His name , through the woods as he wander 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="22">Was still made the burthen of every song .</l>
     <l n="23">That the concert was exquisite , all were agreed , [ p 5 ]</l>
     <l n="24">And so were the ball , and the supper indeed ,</l>
     <l n="25">The company too of the very first rank ,</l>
     <l n="26">And the wit that prevail 'd , and the toasts that were drank :</l>
     <l n="27">He found to his infinite rage and vexation ,</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Twas the favourite subject half over the nation ;</l>
     <l n="29">And feeling no longer a relish to roam ,</l>
     <l n="30">He return 'd to his Lioness , sullenly , home .</l>
     <l n="31">“ Fair consort of mine , ‘ tis our pleasure , ” he said ,</l>
     <l n="32">“ To give very shortly , a grand Masquerade .</l>
     <l n="33">Tho ’ the Butterfly 's ball , and the Grasshopper 's feasts ,</l>
     <l n="34">Were too mean for my notice , as King of the beasts ;</l>
     <l n="35">Now the Peacock has chosen to give a fine rout ,</l>
     <l n="36">Which is heard of so much , is so blazon 'd about ,</l>
     <l n="37">Has excited such rapture , and warm approbation , [ p 6 ]</l>
     <l n="38">As threatens the rank which we hold in creation .</l>
     <l n="39">Then with diligence , love , for my banquet prepare ,</l>
     <l n="40">And mind all the beasts of the forest are there . ”</l>
     <l n="41">‘ Twas the task of the Jackal the tickets to pen ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ The Lion sees masks , on the twentieth , at ten . ”</l>
     <l n="43">It would take a whole volume distinctly to name ,</l>
     <l n="44">The answer on answer that following came .</l>
     <l n="45">There were some that were sick from the changeable weather ,</l>
     <l n="46">And some long engag 'd in snug parties together .</l>
     <l n="47">But few , very few would refuse such a thing ,</l>
     <l n="48">As a grand entertainment announc 'd by their King .</l>
     <l n="49">All devoted the time now to due preparation ,</l>
     <l n="50">To decide on their character , dress , decoration .</l>

     <l n="53">Which their beauty , their talents , and wit should display .</l>
     <l n="54">What licking , and cleaning , what endless adorning ,</l>
     <l n="55">Not a creature stirr 'd out the whole course of the morning ;</l>
     <l n="56">And some of their dresses were barely complete ,</l>
     <l n="57">At the time they were punctually order 'd to meet ,</l>
     <l n="58">The Lioness , willing to sanction the rest ,</l>
     <l n="59">With a helmet , and spear , as Britannia was drest ;</l>
     <l n="60">But the Lion , as lord of the banquet , remain 'd</l>
     <l n="61">In the same noble figure that Nature ordain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="62">And crouching beside her , with dignified mien ,</l>
     <l n="63">Contributed much to the state of his Queen .</l>
     <l n="64">The Jackal Lord Chamberlain waited upon her ,</l>
     <l n="65">And two little Lap-dogs as Pages of Honour :</l>
     <l n="66">While twelve Orang-Outangs were station 'd without , [ p 8 ]</l>
     <l n="67">To usher the company in , and about .</l>
     <l n="68">At the hour which his King had thought proper to name ,</l>
     <l n="69">The Horse , as the Hounyhm of Gulliver came ;</l>
     <l n="70">Unaccustomed to “ utter the thing that is not ,"[*]</l>
     <l n="71">He reach 'd , at the moment he promis 'd , the spot .</l>
     <l n="72">The Fox then appear 'd on a different scent ,</l>
     <l n="73">On foul depredation , and villainy bent ;</l>
     <l n="74">And the dress of a country attorney he chose ,</l>
     <l n="75">To his purpose best suited , as all the world knows !</l>
     <l n="76">With looks as impatient , and teeming with sin ,</l>
     <l n="77">The Wolf in Sheep'shYpppHeNclothing was next usher 'd in .</l>

     <l n="93">But there was , it appear 'd , quite enough to alarm her , [ p 10 ]</l>
