    <head>INTRODUCTION .</head>
    <p n="1">Walter Scott , the ninth of a family of twelve children , was born at Edinburgh in August , 1771 . His first consciousness of existence dated from the time when he was sent , a lame , delicate child , to Sandyknowe , the residence of his paternal grandfather . Here he “ was often carried out and laid down beside the old shepherd among the crags or rocks round which he fed his sheep . ” If Scott 's genius was late in flowering , who can say that the budding did not begin in that early , close companionship with the Highland country which he was to reproduce so vividly in his verse and fiction ?</p>
    <p n="2">With strength increased by open-air life , although still slightly lame , we find him later a sturdy , active , not over-studious boy at school at Edinburgh and Kelso , and at fifteen beginning in his father 's office the legal studies which he continued at the university .</p>
    <p n="3">Referring to the time after leaving the high school , when he made the acquaintance of Tasso 's “ Jerusalem Delivered , ” Percy 's “ Reliques , ” and the best works of English fiction , Scott says , “ To this period I can trace distinctly the awakening of that delightful feeling for the beauties of natural objects which has never deserted me . From this time the love of natural beauty , more especially when combined with ancient ruins or remains of our fathers ’ piety or splendor , became within me an insatiable passion , which , if circumstances had permitted , I would willingly have gratified by traveling half over the globe . ”</p>
    <p n="4">His gigantic memory had always appropriated most eagerly the heroic and romantic elements of verse , tale , and history , from the days when , a child , he read Pope 's translation of Homer aloud to his mother , to the time when he hunted ballads and chased traditions with the keen zest of a scholar and an antiquary .</p>
    <p n="5">The first notable outcome of these researches was his “ Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border , ” published in 1802 . To this collection of ancient Border ballads , which he had spent years in collecting , were added some spirited new ones which he had deftly shaped to the old models . This form of poetic expression was especially suited to the genius of Scott , and the class of subjects to which it was usually adapted had long been the object of his enthusiastic study .</p>
    <p n="6">The amplification , then , of the ballad to the proportions of the more pretentious metrical romance came by a natural process of crystallization of the elements of a rare power , profound research , and inspiring themes .</p>
    <p n="7">The first of the more ambitious efforts of Scott was the “ Lay of the Last Minstrel , ” which was published in 1805 . This became immediately and generally popular , and paved the way for the favorable reception of later productions . In 1808 “ Marmion , ” the greatest poetical work of Scott , appeared . This was so enthusiastically received , that a certain friend urged him to be satisfied with such unexampled success , and refrain from publishing anything more , lest he impair his prestige . To this he replied , “ If I fail , it is a sign that I ought never to have succeeded , and I will write prose for life : you shall see no change in my temper , nor will I eat a single meal the worse . But if I succeed ,</p>
    <p n="8">“ ‘ Up with the bonnie blue bonnet , The dirk , and the feather , and a ’ ! ' ”</p>
    <p n="9">In this confident , buoyant spirit he made another venture , “ The Lady of the Lake , ” published in 1810 ; and its extraordinary success justified his expectations . How sincere and widespread was the enthusiastic appreciation of this poem may be judged from the following instance , mentioned in Lockhart 's “ Life of Scott : ” “ In the course of the day , when ‘ The Lady of the Lake ’ first reached Sir Adam Fergusson , he was posted with his company on a point of ground exposed to the enemy 's artillery , somewhere , no doubt , on the lines of Torres Vedras . The men were ordered to lie prostrate on the ground . While they kept that attitude , the captain , kneeling at the head , read aloud the description of the battle in Canto VI ., and the listening soldiers only interrupted him by a joyous huzza when the French shot struck the bank close above them . ” We are not surprised at the soldierly tribute to the power of a poet “ through whose head a regiment of horse had been exercising since he was five years old , ” whose sympathies had always been in touch with heroic achievement and chivalrous enterprise , and whose poems rang “ with the quick , metrical tramp of his own moss-troopers ; ” but this was only a fractional though precious part of the applause that greeted him . “ The whole country rang with the praises of the poet ; crowds set off to view the scenery of Loch Katrine , till then comparatively unknown ; and , as the book came out just before the season for excursions , every house and inn in that neighborhood was crammed with a constant succession of visitors . ”</p>
    <p n="10">Scott , in speaking of this poem , says , “ The ancient manners , the habits and customs , of the aboriginal race by whom the Highlands of Scotland were inhabited , had always appeared to me peculiarly adapted to poetry . The change in their manners , too , had taken place almost within my own time , or at least I had learned many particulars concerning the ancient state of the Highlands from the old men of the last generation . I had also read a great deal , seen much , and heard more , of the romantic country where I was in the habit of spending every autumn ; and the scenery of Loch Katrine was connected with the recollection of many a dear friend and merry expedition of former days . This poem , the action of which lay among scenes so beautiful , and so deeply imprinted upon my recollections , was a labor of love ; and it was no less so to recall the manners and incidents introduced . The frequent custom of James IV ., and particularly of James V ., of walking through the kingdom in disguise , afforded me the hint of an incident which never fails to be interesting if managed with the slightest address or dexterity . ”</p>
    <p n="11">The high-water mark of Scott 's popularity as a poet was reached with “ The Lady of the Lake . ” In 1813 he published “ Rokeby , ” and in 1814 “ The Lord of the Isles . ” In the latter year “ Waverley ” appeared anonymously ; and with this prose romance began Scott 's career as a novelist , which extended through fourteen years . In this period of time he wrote twenty-three novels , besides some other works of minor importance .</p>

  <body>
   <p>“ The land of the lakes and the mountains , and of the brave men , ” as the old Scots called their country , included the two great divisions , the Highlands and the Borders , which were so much wilder and more barbarous than the others , that they might be said to be altogether without law . Although nominally subject to the King of Scotland , yet they were so untamable that the enforcement of justice was almost as difficult as the subjugation of a foreign people .</p>
   <p>The Highlands , rocky and mountainous parts of the country , comprised a large share of the north of Scotland . It was into these pathless wilds that the Romans drove the ancient Britons , and it was from these retreats that the fugitives afterward sallied forth to harass their conquerors .</p>
   <p>The language of the Highlands , the Gaelic , was totally different from that of the Lowlands , which resembled English . The dress of the mountaineers also differed from that of the Lowlanders . They wore a plaid or mantle of frieze , or of a striped stuff called tartan , one end of which , being wrapped around the waist , formed a short petticoat , which descended to the knee , while the rest they folded around them like a sort of cloak . Their feet were covered with buskins made of rawhide ; and the usual head covering was a cap called a “ bonnet . ” They went always armed . Their weapons were bows and arrows , large swords , poleaxes , and daggers for close fight . For defense they had a round wooden shield , or target , stuck full of nails , and their great men had shirts of mail composed of links of iron . The common men sometimes wore a jacket of leather , having plates of metal stitched into it , but usually had no armor .</p>
   <p>The Highlanders were divided into clans or tribes . All members of a clan supposed themselves to be descended from the same common ancestor , whose name distinguished them from other clans . Thus , one tribe was called MacDonald , which signifies the sons of Donald ; another MacGregor , the sons of Gregor ; MacNeil , the sons of Neil ; and so on . They yielded unquestioning obedience to their chief , even when their submission to his orders implied disloyalty to the King . Each tribe had its own special territory , any invasion of which was punished as severely as though the foe had been of another nationality . Macaulay says of the sentiment that actuated them , “ Their intense attachment to their own tribe and to their own patriarch , though politically an evil , partook of the nature of virtue . The sentiment was misdirected and ill-regulated , but still it was heroic . There must be some elevation of soul in a man who loves the society of which he is a member , and the leader whom he follows , with a love stronger than the love of life . It was true that the Highlander had few scruples about shedding the blood of an enemy ; but it was not less true that he had high notions of the duty of observing faith to allies , and hospitality to guests . ”</p>
   <p>The Highlanders were continually at war with the Lowlanders . They did not regard their plundering raids upon the richer grounds of the Lowlands as robbery , but as rightful recovery of possessions which had been wrongfully wrested from their ancestors . The Lowlanders , equal in courage and superior in discipline , could not be easily overcome , and thus there was almost constant war or discord between them .</p>
   <p>Some of the more powerful Highland chiefs set themselves up as independent sovereigns , and even made alliances with the English in their own name . Macaulay says that “ national enmities have always been fiercest among Borderers ; and the enmity between the Highland Borderer and the Lowland Borderer along the whole frontier was the growth of ages , and was kept fresh by constant injuries . ” The Borderers were also divided into clans , and their devotion to their chieftain was complete . From their proximity to England , and their frequent incursions into its territory , they added to the perplexities of Scottish rule , which were already great by reason of constant internal dissension .</p>
   <p>The Highlanders fought always on foot : the Borderers were all horsemen . The Borderers spoke the same language as the Lowlanders , wore the same sort of dress , and carried the same arms . Being accustomed to fight against the English , they were also much better disciplined than the Highlanders ; but , in point of obedience , they were not much different from the clans of the north .</p>
   <p>Military officers , called “ wardens , ” were appointed along the Borders to keep these unruly people in order ; but , as these wardens were generally chiefs of clans , they did not do much to mend the evil . The good Lord James of Douglas was intrusted with a great part of the charge of the Borders by Robert the Bruce . He was faithful to his trust , but the clan thus acquired power which was afterward dangerous to the country .</p>
   <p>The hostility between the Highlanders and the Lowlanders was only equaled by the hatred both felt toward their Saxon neighbors , and it was not till 1745 that Scotland was subjugated by England . The conquest was so complete that even the national dress was abolished . The old Gaelic institutions and manners were modified , and the power of the clan chieftain was broken . With the last struggle of the exiled Stuart party , which ended in defeat at Culloden , began a new era for Scotland . To the old reign of lawlessness and disorder succeeded measures that were wisely coercive , and which finally secured a unity of Scottish interests , and greatly augmented prosperity in the entire kingdom .</p>
   <p>In August , 1502 , James IV . of Scotland married Princess Margaret Tudor , sister of Henry VIII . of England . It was hoped that this alliance would be the means of ending the bitter hostility which had existed between Scotland and England since the time of Edward I . A temporary peace ensued , but it was not till a century later that a descendant of the Scottish James sat on the throne of England .</p>
   <p>The only son of James IV . and Margaret who survived infancy was James V. ( James Fitz-James of the poem ) . He was born in 1513 , and crowned when less than ten years old , his father having been slain at the battle of Flodden Field , which had resulted so disastrously for Scotland .</p>
   <p>By the will of James IV ., Margaret was to be queen regent as long as she remained a widow . In 1514 she lost the regency and greatly impaired her influence by marrying Archibald Douglas , Earl of Angus . Bitter enmity already existed between the head of the Douglas clan and other Scottish nobles ; and , when Angus had the added dignity of being the husband of the queen regent , the jealousy and rivalry were greatly increased .</p>
   <p>After losing the regency , Margaret was obliged to surrender the control of her son to Parliament . The Duke of Albany , the younger son of James III ., was appointed regent during the minority of the King . Albany , who had spent many years at the luxurious court of France , returned to his native country with no appreciation of its real needs , and little sympathy with the Scotch . He failed to administer the government in a satisfactory manner . Angus plotted to secure control of affairs , and to gain custody of the young King . He assumed all the authority of a regent , without possessing any claim to the title , and kept James under close guard while pretending to govern the realm in his name .</p>
   <p>The King was very restive under this irksome and unlawful restraint , and sympathized strongly with efforts which were made for his release . In 1526 two armed attempts were made to liberate him . Both resulted in failure . What could not be accomplished by force was finally secured by a cleverly planned stratagem of the royal captive ; and he escaped to Stirling Castle , where devoted adherents awaited him . Two months later , Parliament declared the estates of the Douglases forfeited to the Crown , and there was neither place nor grace left in Scotland for any bearing the obnoxious name .</p>
   <p>James even extended his animosity to one Archibald Douglas of Kilspendie ( the Douglas of the poem ) , to whom he had been greatly attached . A touching story is told of the return of the old man , who had grown weary of his exile in England , and longed for a sight of Scotland and the former friendly regard of the King , whom he had never personally offended . He was doomed to undeserved disappointment , however , as James was unrelenting in his resentment , and would not modify any of the harsh conditions of his oath against the hated Douglas clan .</p>
   <p>Although one of the most formidable obstacles to the exercise of royal rule disappeared with the crushing of the power of the Douglases , James still met much opposition from the nobility .</p>
   <p>There were many abuses connected with the irregular rule exercised during his minority , and portions of the kingdom were in a condition of great lawlessness , which made it necessary for him to resort to severe measures . A five-years ’ truce was concluded with England in 1528 , which allowed him to devote himself to the internal interests of Scotland . The following year he began to reduce the rebellious Borders to submission . By force and by craft he brought them into his power , putting to death many of the great nobles , and greatly limiting the privileges of those he allowed to live , until some degree of order was established .</p>
   <p>After he had subdued the Borders , he proceeded against the Highland chieftains with equal rigor . The insubordination which had prevailed in that part of Scotland yielded to the unsparing severity of James , and life and property became measurably secure .</p>
   <p>The King was greatly aided in the execution of his plans by the clergy , whom he favored in many ways , especially by countenancing the repression of heresy ,— a course quite contrary to that pursued by his uncle , Henry VIII .</p>
   <p>Popular sentiment also supported this “ King of the Commons , ” as he was called from his habit of mingling with the common people , and taking a practical interest in their welfare . He was accustomed to travel over the kingdom in disguise , that he might learn the true condition of his subjects , and investigate the administration of justice . This custom , added to his fondness for hunting , gave him an intimate acquaintance with his kingdom and his people .</p>
   <p>Scott says of him , “ He was handsome in his person , and resembled his father in the fondness for military exercises and the spirit of chivalrous honor which James IV . loved to display . He also inherited his father 's love of justice , and his desire to establish and enforce wise and equal laws .... He was a well-educated and accomplished man , and , like his ancestor James I ., was a poet and a musician . He had , however , his defects . He avoided his father 's failing of profusion , having no hoarded treasures to employ on pomp and show , but he rather fell into the opposite fault , being of a temper too parsimonious ; and , though he loved state and display , he endeavored to gratify that taste as economically as possible , so that he has been censured as rather close and covetous .... It must be added , that , when provoked , he was unrelenting even to cruelty ; for which he had some apology , considering the ferocity of the subjects over whom he reigned . But , on the whole , James V. was an amiable man and a good sovereign . ”</p>
   <p>Henry VIII . endeavored to enlist the aid of James in an organized resistance to the authority of the Church . The Scottish King apparently favored , in a measure , his uncle 's policy ; but his alliance with France restored and increased his adherence to papal rule .</p>
   <p>The failure of James to keep an appointment made for meeting King Henry at York offended the latter , who accused him of dealing treacherously , and declared war against Scotland . Many of the Scottish nobles were disaffected , and the army was disorganized . At Solway Moss , James was openly defied by his nobility . Scott says regarding this bitter humiliation , “ He shut himself up in the palace of Falkland , and refused to listen to any consolation . A burning fever , the consequence of his grief and shame , seized on the unfortunate monarch . They brought him tidings that his wife had given birth to a daughter ; but he only replied , ‘ Is it so ? ’ reflecting on the alliance which had placed the Stuart family on the throne . ‘ Then God 's will be done . It came with a lass , and it will go with a lass . ’ With these words , presaging the extinction of his house , he made a signal of adieu to his courtiers , spoke little more , but turned his face to the wall , and died<span type="note_anchor">[ 1542 ]</span>of the most melancholy of all diseases , a broken heart . ”</p>
   <p>The story of “ The Lady of the Lake ” is briefly as follows :—</p>
   <p>CANTO FIRST .— A huntsman who has distanced his companions and lost his steed , which , urged beyond endurance , has fallen dead in the Trosachs , has finally wandered over rocky ways to the shore of Loch Katrine . Here he winds his horn , hoping the sounds may reach his comrades . In response , a skiff appears rowed by a maiden , who thinks the blast was from her father 's horn . Although at first startled , she is reassured by the “ wildered wanderer 's ” explanation , and proffers the hospitality of her father 's dwelling . They row across the lake to the island home , where , in the absence of the chieftain , Ellen , and the mistress of the mansion , the graceful Dame Margaret , dispense true Highland hospitality . He styles himself Knight of Snowdoun , James Fitz-James , but fails to learn the names of his hosts . “ The stranger 's bed of heather ” was spread for the tired huntsman ; but his rest was disturbed by “ broken dreams , ” in which the exiled Douglases played a prominent part .</p>
   <p>CANTO SECOND .— The stranger takes his leave in the early morning . Allan , the old minstrel , tunes his harp to a parting song , and Ellen watches the knight “ wind slowly round the hill . ” Then , chiding herself for a momentary interest in him , she bids Allan sing in praise of the Graemes , one of whom is her lover . The old man is brooding over the ominous fallen sword , and cannot respond . He foresees the demand of Roderick Dhu , and distrusts the parting guest . Their conversation is interrupted by the music of the pibroch and the boat-song , which precede the landing of her cousin Roderick Dhu and his rough followers . Lady Margaret and her maids come to meet him . Ellen , quite willing to avoid her cousin , eagerly responds to her father 's bugle horn , and hastens to meet him in her skiff . Malcolm Graeme accompanies him . Roderick is informed that the King is preparing to deal with the Highland freebooters as severely as he has already done with the Border chieftains , and that the retreat of the outlawed Douglas has been discovered . Douglas is ready to withdraw with his daughter , thus lessening the danger of Roderick . The latter demands his alliance and the hand of his daughter . Both are refused by Douglas . A contest arises between Roderick and Graeme , which results in the departure of the latter for the mainland , which he reaches by swimming from the island .</p>
   <p>CANTO THIRD .— On the following morning occurs the consecration , with weird ritual , of the Fiery Cross . Roderick sends it forth by his henchman Malise to summon his followers to a gathering in Lanrick mead . It is borne eastward , passing from band to band , stopping for neither bridal nor burial , till the entire clan is summoned to the appointed place . The same morning Douglas departs with his daughter and Allan-Bane to seek refuge in the Goblin-cave on the side of Benvenue . Roderick passes the cavern on his way to the rally in Lanrick mead , and listens , as he lingers , to the sound of Ellen 's voice in a hymn to the Virgin .</p>
   <p>CANTO FOURTH .— The Highland clans have responded to the summons of the Fiery Cross . The Lowlanders are at Doune , ready to advance . Brian , the hermit monk , has tried a strange augury to determine on which side success shall be . He prophesies that that party shall be victorious which first sheds blood . Meantime Douglas has left his cavern retreat on some mission not made known to Ellen and Allan-Bane . They are instructed , however , to meet him at Cambus-kenneth if he does not return by nightfall . Ellen is anxious for her father 's safety , believing he has gone to secure the release of Malcolm Graeme . She scarcely heeds the song of Allan-Bane , who endeavors to cheer her . While they are speaking , Fitz-James appears . He declares his love for Ellen , and urges her to escape with him to Stirling . She replies by a frank avowal of her love for Malcolm Graeme . The knight 's sympathy is enlisted , and he leaves with her a ring , given him by the King for saving his life . This , he says , if presented to the King , will secure his protection for her and hers . Ellen and Allan-Bane endeavor to warn Fitz-James against the guide who departs with him . Their suspicions are confirmed by Blanche of Devan , a woman who has been half crazed since Roderick Dhu murdered her bridegroom in a wild Lowland raid . Her incoherent song is meant as a warning to the wandering knight in the Lowland dress . He charges Murdoch with treacherous intent . The guide seeks to escape , but not without aiming an arrow at Fitz-James . It grazes his crest , and lodges in the heart of Blanche of Devan . Fitz-James slays Murdoch , and returns to soothe the dying maniac . He promises to avenge her , and fastens to his bonnet a braid of her own and her bridegroom 's hair , which he has dipped in her blood . Continuing his way alone after nightfall , he comes upon the camp fire of a stranger , who gives him shelter till morning , when he promises to lead him on his journey .</p>
   <p>CANTO FIFTH .— After a night 's rest and a hasty “ soldier meal ” in the morning , the Gael conducts his guest on his way , in accordance with his promise and Highland custom . Fitz-James allays the mountaineer 's apprehension of an attack by the King , but declares his hostility to Roderick Dhu , and avows his eagerness to meet him in combat . The guide is incensed at this , and sounds a signal which brings to sight armed men on every side . He then reveals himself as Roderick Dhu . He is bound by his word to conduct his guest to Coilantogle ford , and therefore dismisses his followers . When this place is reached , Roderick challenges Fitz-James , and a deadly combat ensues . Throwing away his shield , that his arms may not exceed those of his adversary , he trusts to his sword alone . Fitz-James is superior to his enemy through his knowledge of fencing , and finally overpowers him .</p>
   <p>Fitz-James winds his horn , which is answered by four mounted attendants . He leaves the wounded man with two of them , with orders to bring him to Stirling , and hastens towards the Castle with the others . As they approach it , they perceive Douglas , who comes to surrender himself to the King , hoping thereby to secure the release of Malcolm Graeme and avert the danger that threatens Roderick Dhu . The town is preparing for the burghers ’ sports , in which Douglas decides to join in order that he may attract the attention of the King . He surpasses all other competitors , and receives the prize from the King , who does not recognize him . Douglas endures this in silence , but he cannot refrain from resenting a huntsman 's cruelty to Lufra , the hound , Ellen 's companion . This results in his being seized and taken as a prisoner to the Castle . Meantime a messenger brings to the King tidings of the rising of Clan-Alpine . He sends a hasty message to avert an encounter , as Roderick is already his prisoner in Stirling stronghold .</p>
   <p>CANTO SIXTH .— “ This canto introduces us to the guard room in Stirling Castle , amid the remains of the debauch which has followed the games of the previous day . While the few soldiers who remain awake are finishing their carouse , and talking over the rumors of yesterday 's battle , they are joined by one of their mates , who has been in the field , and brings with him a maiden and a minstrel ( Ellen and Allan-Bane ) . They are at first disposed to treat the maiden roughly ; but the sight of her innocent beauty , and her story of misfortune , touch the heart of one of the roughest in the company , who becomes her champion . Presently they are joined by the officer of the guard , who , at first sight of Fitz-James 's ring , commits the lady to proper care , while John of Brent , the guardsman who had interfered , grants Allan 's request to see his master ; but , fancying that the minstrel is one of Roderick 's clansmen , he shows him into the wrong cell , where he finds the wounded chief . After anxious inquiries as to the safety of his kindred , Roderick asks anew of the fight ; and the minstrel , in spirited verse , sings of the battle of Beal ’ an Duine , whose issue was left doubtful by the arrival of a messenger from the King with orders to stay the fight . But before he had finished his song the stern spirit had fled , and the minstrel 's harp changes its tune from battle song to death dirge .</p>
   <p>“ Meanwhile Ellen waits anxiously and impatiently for her audience with the King . At last Fitz-James appears to escort her to the audience chamber . Faltering , she looks round to find the King , and sees , to her surprise , that her companion alone remains covered , and ‘ Snowdoun 's Knight is Scotland 's King . ’ He tells her how the feud with Douglas is at an end , and that her father is now to be ‘ the friend and bulwark of his throne . ’ But she still has the ring , still some boon to ask . She begs for Roderick 's life , but that is past giving ; and when she shrinks from further request , the King calls forth Malcolm , and throws over him a golden chain , which he gives to Ellen to keep . ” — R. W. Taylor .</p>

All members of the clan who saw this symbol , and who were capable of bearing arms , were obliged to appear in arms forthwith at the appointed rendezvous . Arrived at the next hamlet , the messenger delivered the symbol and the name of the rendezvous to the principal personage , who immediately forwarded them by a fresh messenger . In this way the signal for gathering was disseminated throughout the territory of a large clan in a surprisingly short space of time .</p>

Yet , witness every quaking limb , My sunken pulse , my eyeballs dim , My soul with harrowing anguish torn , This for my Chieftain have I borne !— The shapes that sought my fearful couch , A human tongue may ne'er avouch ; No mortal man ,— save he , who , bred Between the living and the dead , Is gifted beyond nature 's law ,— Had e'er survived to say he saw .

Not spoke in word , nor blazed<span type="note_anchor">[ 230 ]</span>in scroll , But borne and branded on my soul ;— WHICH SPILLS THE FOREMOST FOEMAN 'S LIFE , THAT PARTY CONQUERS IN THE STRIFE . ” —</p>

    <p n="47">SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDY .</p>
    <p n="48">The Lady of the Lake is usually read in the first year of the high school course , and it is with this fact in mind that the following suggestions have been made . It is an excellent book with which to begin the study of the ordinary forms of poetry , of plot structure , and the simpler problems of description . For this reason in the exercises that follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics .</p>
    <p n="49">THE POEM .</p>
    <p n="50">The Lady of the Lake is an excellent example of the minor epic . Corresponding to the “ Arms and the man I sing , ” of the AEneid , and the invocation to the Muse , are the statement of the theme , “ Knighthood 's dauntless deed and Beauty 's matchless eye , ” and the invocation to the Harp of the North , in the opening stanzas . For the heroes , descendants of the gods , of the great epic , we have a king , the chieftain of a great clan , an outlaw earl and his daughter , characters less elevated than those of the great epic , but still important . The element of the supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here supplied by the minstrel , Brian the priest , and the harp . The interest of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic . The romantic story of Ellen and Malcolm , however , lies quite outside the realm of the great epic , which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of people rather than with that of an individual .</p>
    <p n="51">THE PLOT .</p>
    <p n="52">There are two threads to the story , one concerned with the love story of Ellen and Malcolm , the main plot ; and one with Roderick and his clan against the King , the minor plot . The connection between them is very slight , the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the other , but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the love story of Ellen and Malcolm . The plot is an excellent one for the beginner to study as the structure is so evident . The following is a simple outline of the main incidents of the story .</p>
    <p n="53">I . The complication :</p>
    <p n="54">1 . The coming of the stranger , later supposed by Roderick to be a spy of the King . 2 . The return of Douglas , guided by Malcolm , an act which brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King . 3 . Roderick 's proposal for Ellen 's hand in order to avert the danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition of the latter by the King 's men . 4 . The rejection of the proposal , leading to the withdrawal of Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm . 5 . The preparations for war made by Roderick , including the sending of the Fiery Cross , and the Taghairm .</p>
    <p n="55">II . The height or climax .</p>
    <p n="56">1 . Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin . 2 . Douglas on his way to give himself up . 3 . Malcolm in prison for aiding Douglas .</p>
    <p n="57">III . The turning point in the plot .</p>
    <p n="58">1 . The coming of Fitz-James . 2 . The giving of the ring . 3 . The gay music of the harp .</p>
    <p n="59">IV . The unraveling of the plot .</p>
    <p n="60">1 . The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick . 2 . The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas 's prowess and generosity . 3 . The arrival of Ellen at the court . 4 . The battle of Beal ‘ an Duine . 5 . Roderick 's death . 6 . The freeing of Malcolm . 7 . The restoration of the Douglases .</p>
    <p n="61">SCOTT 'S USE OF DESCRIPTION .</p>
    <p n="62">All of Scott 's works afford excellent models of description for the beginner in this very difficult form of composition . He deals with the problems of description in a simple and evident manner . In most cases he begins his description with the point of view , and chooses the details in accordance with that point of view . The principle of order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find and follow , and the beauty of his contrasts , the vanity and vividness of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls in the first year of the high school . If properly taught a pupil must leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words . In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate . In the special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon description because of the adaptability of his description to the needs of the student .</p>

    <p n="136">¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching of the novel , narrative poetry , lyric poetry , the drama , and the essay .

The lists of questions are by no means exhaustive , but those that are given are suggestive and typical .</p>

    <p n="148">A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE</p>

    <p n="150">A companion volume to the author 's History of English Literature . It describes the greatest achievements in American literature from colonial times to the present , placing emphasis not only upon men , but also upon literary movements , the causes of which are thoroughly investigated . Further , the relation of each period of American literature to the corresponding epoch of English literature has been carefully brought out — and each period is illuminated by a brief survey of its history .</p>
    <p n="151">¶ The seven chapters of the book treat in succession of Colonial Literature , The Emergence of a Nation ( 1754-1809 ) , the New York Group , The New England Group , Southern Literature , Western Literature , and the Eastern Realists . To these are added a supplementary list of less important authors and their chief works , as well as A Glance Backward , which emphasizes in brief compass the most important truths taught by American literature .</p>
    <p n="152">¶ At the end of each chapter is a summary which helps to fix the period in mind by briefly reviewing the most significant achievements . This is followed by extensive historical and literary references for further study , by a very helpful list of suggested readings , and by questions and suggestions , designed to stimulate the student 's interest and enthusiasm , and to lead him to study and investigate further for himself the remarkable literary record of American aspiration and accomplishment .</p>
