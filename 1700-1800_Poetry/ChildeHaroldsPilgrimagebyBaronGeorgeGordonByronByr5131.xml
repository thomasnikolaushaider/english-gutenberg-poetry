    <head>TO IANTHE . { 1 }</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Not in those climes where I have late been straying ,</l>
     <l n="2">Though Beauty long hath there been matchless deemed ,</l>
     <l n="3">Not in those visions to the heart displaying</l>
     <l n="4">Forms which it sighs but to have only dreamed ,</l>
     <l n="5">Hath aught like thee in truth or fancy seemed :</l>
     <l n="6">Nor , having seen thee , shall I vainly seek</l>
     <l n="7">To paint those charms which varied as they beamed -</l>
     <l n="8">To such as see thee not my words were weak ;</l>
     <l n="9">To those who gaze on thee , what language could they speak ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Ah ! mayst thou ever be what now thou art ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor unbeseem the promise of thy spring ,</l>
     <l n="12">As fair in form , as warm yet pure in heart ,</l>
     <l n="13">Love 's image upon earth without his wing ,</l>
     <l n="14">And guileless beyond Hope 's imagining !</l>
     <l n="15">And surely she who now so fondly rears</l>
     <l n="16">Thy youth , in thee , thus hourly brightening ,</l>
     <l n="17">Beholds the rainbow of her future years ,</l>
     <l n="18">Before whose heavenly hues all sorrow disappears .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Young Peri of the West !— ‘ tis well for me</l>
     <l n="20">My years already doubly number thine ;</l>
     <l n="21">My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee ,</l>
     <l n="22">And safely view thy ripening beauties shine :</l>
     <l n="23">Happy , I ne'er shall see them in decline ;</l>
     <l n="24">Happier , that while all younger hearts shall bleed</l>
     <l n="25">Mine shall escape the doom thine eyes assign</l>
     <l n="26">To those whose admiration shall succeed ,</l>
     <l n="27">But mixed with pangs to Love 's even loveliest hours decreed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="28">Oh ! let that eye , which , wild as the gazelle 's ,</l>
     <l n="29">Now brightly bold or beautifully shy ,</l>
     <l n="30">Wins as it wanders , dazzles where it dwells ,</l>
     <l n="31">Glance o'er this page , nor to my verse deny</l>
     <l n="32">That smile for which my breast might vainly sigh ,</l>
     <l n="33">Could I to thee be ever more than friend :</l>
     <l n="34">This much , dear maid , accord ; nor question why</l>
     <l n="35">To one so young my strain I would commend ,</l>
     <l n="36">But bid me with my wreath one matchless lily blend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">Such is thy name with this my verse entwined ;</l>
     <l n="38">And long as kinder eyes a look shall cast</l>
     <l n="39">On Harold 's page , Ianthe 's here enshrined</l>
     <l n="40">Shall thus be first beheld , forgotten last :</l>
     <l n="41">My days once numbered , should this homage past</l>
     <l n="42">Attract thy fairy fingers near the lyre</l>
     <l n="43">Of him who hailed thee , loveliest as thou wast ,</l>
     <l n="44">Such is the most my memory may desire ;</l>
     <l n="45">Though more than Hope can claim , could Friendship less require ?</l>

      <l n="48">Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth ,</l>
      <l n="49">Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred hill :</l>
      <l n="50">Yet there I 've wandered by thy vaunted rill ;</l>
      <l n="51">Yes ! sighed o'er Delphi 's long-deserted shrine</l>
      <l n="52">Where , save that feeble fountain , all is still ;</l>

      <l n="55">Whilome in Albion 's isle there dwelt a youth ,</l>
      <l n="56">Who ne in virtue 's ways did take delight ;</l>
      <l n="57">But spent his days in riot most uncouth ,</l>
      <l n="58">And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night .</l>
      <l n="59">Ah , me ! in sooth he was a shameless wight ,</l>
      <l n="60">Sore given to revel and ungodly glee ;</l>
      <l n="61">Few earthly things found favour in his sight</l>
      <l n="62">Save concubines and carnal companie ,</l>
      <l n="63">And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree .</l>

      <l n="64">Childe Harold was he hight : — but whence his name</l>
      <l n="65">And lineage long , it suits me not to say ;</l>
      <l n="66">Suffice it , that perchance they were of fame ,</l>
      <l n="67">And had been glorious in another day :</l>
      <l n="68">But one sad losel soils a name for aye ,</l>
      <l n="69">However mighty in the olden time ;</l>
      <l n="70">Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay ,</l>
      <l n="71">Nor florid prose , nor honeyed lines of rhyme ,</l>
      <l n="72">Can blazon evil deeds , or consecrate a crime .</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="9">
      <l n="73">Childe Harold basked him in the noontide sun ,</l>
      <l n="74">Disporting there like any other fly ,</l>
      <l n="75">Nor deemed before his little day was done</l>
      <l n="76">One blast might chill him into misery .</l>
      <l n="77">But long ere scarce a third of his passed by ,</l>
      <l n="78">Worse than adversity the Childe befell ;</l>
      <l n="79">He felt the fulness of satiety :</l>
      <l n="80">Then loathed he in his native land to dwell ,</l>
      <l n="81">Which seemed to him more lone than eremite 's sad cell .</l>

    <lg type="part" n="6">
     <head>V .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="10">
      <l n="82">For he through Sin 's long labyrinth had run ,</l>
      <l n="83">Nor made atonement when he did amiss ,</l>
      <l n="84">Had sighed to many , though he loved but one ,</l>
      <l n="85">And that loved one , alas , could ne'er be his .</l>
      <l n="86">Ah , happy she ! to ‘ scape from him whose kiss</l>
      <l n="87">Had been pollution unto aught so chaste ;</l>
      <l n="88">Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss ,</l>
      <l n="89">And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste ,</l>

      <l n="91">And now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart ,</l>
      <l n="92">And from his fellow bacchanals would flee ;</l>
      <l n="93">‘ Tis said , at times the sullen tear would start ,</l>
      <l n="94">But pride congealed the drop within his e'e :</l>
      <l n="95">Apart he stalked in joyless reverie ,</l>
      <l n="96">And from his native land resolved to go ,</l>
      <l n="97">And visit scorching climes beyond the sea ;</l>
      <l n="98">With pleasure drugged , he almost longed for woe ,</l>
      <l n="99">And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below .</l>

      <l n="100">The Childe departed from his father 's hall ;</l>

      <l n="102">So old , it seemed only not to fall ,</l>
      <l n="103">Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle .</l>
      <l n="104">Monastic dome ! condemned to uses vile !</l>
      <l n="105">Where superstition once had made her den ,</l>
      <l n="106">Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile ;</l>
      <l n="107">And monks might deem their time was come agen ,</l>

      <l n="109">Yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood ,</l>
      <l n="110">Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold 's brow ,</l>
      <l n="111">As if the memory of some deadly feud</l>
      <l n="112">Or disappointed passion lurked below :</l>
      <l n="113">But this none knew , nor haply cared to know ;</l>
      <l n="114">For his was not that open , artless soul</l>
      <l n="115">That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow ;</l>
      <l n="116">Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole ,</l>
      <l n="117">Whate'er this grief mote be , which he could not control .</l>

      <l n="118">And none did love him : though to hall and bower</l>
      <l n="119">He gathered revellers from far and near ,</l>
      <l n="120">He knew them flatterers of the festal hour ;</l>
      <l n="121">The heartless parasites of present cheer .</l>
      <l n="122">Yea , none did love him — not his lemans dear -</l>
      <l n="123">But pomp and power alone are woman 's care ,</l>
      <l n="124">And where these are light Eros finds a feere ;</l>
      <l n="125">Maidens , like moths , are ever caught by glare ,</l>
      <l n="126">And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair .</l>

      <l n="130">Before his weary pilgrimage begun :</l>
      <l n="131">If friends he had , he bade adieu to none .</l>
      <l n="132">Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel ;</l>
      <l n="133">Ye , who have known what ‘ tis to dote upon</l>
      <l n="134">A few dear objects , will in sadness feel</l>

      <l n="148">And soon were lost in circumambient foam ;</l>
      <l n="149">And then , it may be , of his wish to roam</l>
      <l n="150">Repented he , but in his bosom slept</l>
      <l n="151">The silent thought , nor from his lips did come</l>
      <l n="152">One word of wail , whilst others sate and wept ,</l>
      <l n="153">And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept .</l>

      <l n="158">And now his fingers o'er it he did fling ,</l>

      <l n="160">While flew the vessel on her snowy wing ,</l>
