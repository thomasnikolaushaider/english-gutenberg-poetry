    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">The original , of which this is a translation , is universally considered one of the very best among many beautiful poems written by the same illustrious author . The sublime didactic thoughts therein expressed , in language majestic and yet so simple , have won for it a constantly increasing popularity ; and , during half a century , in a language so rich in literary beauties as the Swedish , have maintained it among the foremost of poetical productions of its kind .</p>
    <p n="2">A correct English translation , therefore , is fraught with difficulties which but few persons can appreciate . It has been my aim to reproduce the poem in the original meter , with the rhymes in their proper places . Of course , care has been taken to preserve the sense , and even the idioms of the original . How far I have been successful it is hardly for me to say . As it is , I give it to the reading public .</p>
    <p n="3">The poem has undoubted merits in the original . If the merits are concealed in the translation , the fault is mine .</p>

    <head>BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR .</head>
     <l n="1">Gathered from the files in the Royal Academy of Sciences , Stockholm ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sweden .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Johan Olof Wallin , ( pronounced Valleen ) , the author of the “ ANGEL OF DEATH , ” was a native of Sweden , and was born in the parish of Stora Tuna , in the province of Dalarne ( Dalecarlia ) , October 15 , 1779 . His father was a military man , and some time after Johan 's birth became captain of the Dalecarlia regiment . The future poet and preacher was one of a large family , much larger than accorded well with the somewhat restricted means of the captain of a regiment .</p>
   <p>At a very early age , young Johan evinced a taste for books , and for study generally ; but the circumstances of his family were not such as to encourage the hope of an academic career . As has often happened in such circumstances , the talents of the boy commanded attention ; and he was not left without a good primary education . At the early age of thirteen he began to help himself ; and , by taking part in the education of others , he contrived to prolong his own studies , and acquired great proficiency in the classics , especially in Latin . When only seventeen years of age , he made his first public appearance at the Gymnasium of Westerås , and by the delivery of a poetical speech in Latin — a speech which is still preserved and which is remarkable for its literary merits — he astonished all his seniors . Henceforth Johan Olof Wallin was a marked man among his contemporaries .</p>
   <p>It was not long after this triumph at the Gymnasium , that young Wallin felt discouraged for the want of funds . It was now desirable that he should give himself to the higher department of study under competent teachers ; but money was needed , and he knew not where to find it . In his difficulty he felt strongly tempted to give up his studies , and to give himself to his father 's profession . His delicate health , however , stood in the way ; and , happily , a serviceable situation as teacher having offered itself , he was saved to literature . In the fall of 1799 , after a most creditable examination , he was entered as student at the Upsala Academy . His career as a student was marked by great success , especially in literature and philosophy ; and , in 1803 , he took his Doctor 's degree . In the same year , he obtained a prize from the Swedish Academy , [ A ] for poetical translations of four of the Odes of Horace . Wallin was now in his twenty-fourth year .</p>
   <p>Encouraged by success , Johan tried the Academy again , and was successful in carrying off , in one session , three prizes , the largest number ever before awarded to one person , at one anniversary . One of them was the “ Grand Prize , ” and was awarded to a poem , called “ The Educator . ” Some of the lines give promise of the temple-orator that was to be :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Thou sentinel on high ! Will night not vanish soon ?</l>
     <l n="2">We doubt the sheen of stars and quiet path of moon ;</l>
     <l n="3">We placed our trust in Thee . Enlight the races striving !</l>
     <l n="4">Will night yet long endure ? Is morning 's watch arriving . "[ B ]</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Other poems followed . By this time , Johan , who had , from an early period , shown a liking for the clerical profession , had passed all his preliminary examinations with honors , and been ordained to the pastoral office . He commanded attention , at once , as a preacher . But he clung to the muses , or the muses clung to him ; and his lyre , having been tuned in harmony with his sacred calling , he soon began to distinguish himself as a writer of hymns . Some of the finest hymns of which the Swedish language can boast , are from the pen of Johan Olof Wallin . Nor were secular themes wholly neglected . On January 20 , 1808 , on the occasion of the unveiling of the statue of King Gustavus Third , he produced the famous Dithyramb , a song which has taken a permanent and honored place in Swedish literature . The same year he presented a similar poem to the Swedish Academy , and was rewarded with a prize of two hundred ducats , the highest prize ever given by the Academy .</p>
   <p>In all great questions of a national or international character , Wallin took a deep and lively interest ; and the powerful influence , which he exerted with tongue and pen , was always wielded in favor of the right . How well he knew how to seize upon and turn to account existing circumstances and passing events , is strikingly illustrated by his poem on George Washington ; his Dithyramb celebrating the union of Sweden and Norway , and his splendid ode on the victories of the allies at Leipzig , Dennewitz and Grossbeeren . The last named composition had an immense success ; and it was circulated by thousands among the soldiers of the Swedish army abroad .</p>
   <p>Wallin was at home in the region of sublime and lofty thought ; but his muse was not one-sided , or in any sense monotonous . Poems of a calm , reflective character flowed gracefully from his pen ; and , when occasion called for the one or the other , he revealed rich veins of satire and humor . One great secret of his literary success , both as a poet and preacher , lay in the simplicity of his style . With him there was never any striving after effect . His thoughts , whether of a lofty or commonplace character , whether hortatory or didactic , whether satirical or humorous , always found natural and easy expression in language which was as direct as it was graceful and easily understood .</p>
   <p>At the comparatively early age of thirty years , Wallin had taken his place in the front rank of the scholars and public men of his day ; and whatever honors were in the gift of his admiring countrymen , were freely showered upon him . Of these honors we mention only a few .</p>
   <p>In 1810 , he was elected a member of the Swedish Academy ; and on several occasions he was raised by acclamation to the proud position of chairman and orator of that learned body . In 1815 , he was made Knight of the Royal Order of the North Star ; and in the same year he became Dom-prost , an office next in order to the Bishop 's , and was honored with a seat in Parliament . In 1818 , he was made Pastor Primarius , and President of the Consistory of Stockholm ; and about this time he became an active and useful member of the Royal Musical Academy . In 1824 , he was raised to the dignity of Bishop of the Church , and became commander of the Royal Order of the North Star and honorary member of the Royal Academy of Literature , History and Antiquities . Of this high body he was four times elected Chairman . In 1828 , he was elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences ; ten years later he was made Praeses . In 1830 , he was elected Court Preacher , and Praeses or President of the Royal Consistory . In 1837 , his honors culminated . He was elected a member of the Upsala association for the promotion of Science ; also member of the Serafimer Order , a distinction rarely conferred except on royal persons and princes of the blood , when he adopted as his motto , “ In Omnipotenti Vinces . ” In the same year , he became archbishop of Sweden and pro-chancellor of the University of Upsala .</p>
   <p>The “ ANGEL OF DEATH , ” singularly characteristic of the author , immediately after its publication took its place in the front rank of the poetic productions of the language . The poem has never ceased to be popular . It is issued each successive year in thousands , and in all sorts of editions ,— some of the recent editions de luxe are marvels of costly taste and typographic skill . His poetic productions are numerous , and they are all of a high order of merit . The “ ANGEL OF DEATH , ” however , partly on account of the undying interest of the subject , and partly , also , because of its bold and daring thought and vigorous expression , is that by which he is best known , and with which his name is destined to be indissolubly linked .</p>
   <p>Wallin is remembered as a great churchman , as well as scholar and poet . As a preacher , he had few if any equals . Of dignified aspect , gifted with a rich sonorous voice , and visibly impressed at all times with the solemn character of his mission , he presented the very ideal of the pulpiteer ; and , whenever and wherever he appeared , he was attended by admiring crowds composed of all ranks and classes of the people . [ C ] As a hymn-writer he had also great success ; and to his taste and skill , the Swedish Church is indebted for its finest collection of sacred songs . [ D ] How gracefully Tegner refers to him in his poem , “ The Children of the Lord 's Supper , ” every reader of Longfellow is well aware :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Hark ! then roll forth at once the mighty tones of the organ ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hover like voices from God , aloft like invisible spirits ;</l>
     <l n="3">Like as Elias in heaven , when he cast from off him his mantle ,</l>
     <l n="4">So cast off the soul its garment of earth , and with one voice ,</l>
     <l n="5">Chimed in the congregation , and sang an anthem immortal</l>
     <l n="6">Of the sublime Wallin , of David 's Harp in the North-land . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For thirty-one years , Wallin occupied a place , prouder , in many respects , than the Swedish throne itself ,— recognized and honored by his countrymen as their greatest scholar , their greatest preacher , and one of their greatest poets . In June , 1839 , in his sixtieth year , the angel of death , of whom he had written so well , approached him with his sad summons ; and , amid the regrets and sorrows of a whole nation , his lofty spirit took its flight to those purer regions , in which , in imagination , it already long had dwelt . He was buried in the new cemetery in Stockholm , which he himself had consecrated ; and his grave is adorned with a large and appropriate monument .</p>
   <p>At the first anniversary meeting of the Swedish Academy , after his death , Bishop Tegner read a memorial poem highly eulogistic of the deceased , and which ended as follows :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And , tire , as it speeds along ,</l>
     <l n="2">The lightly flying Swedish song ;</l>
     <l n="3">Then let its weary wings be rested ,</l>
     <l n="4">Against thy grave — and soar anew</l>
     <l n="5">To starry realms again , to you ,</l>
     <l n="6">With prestige by the Learned Circle vested ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thou bard like few ! Prime speaker uncontested ! "[ E ]</l>

<note>Footnote C : His great popularity with the masses naturally caused them to apply to him for all sorts of information and advice , with full confidence that he knew how to assist and advise in all matters . As an example of his oft peculiar way of treating queer questions , and yet satisfying the questioner , the following may be related : For about twenty years a number of writs and fore-tellings had frightened credulous people with the prediction that the world would perish on a certain given date . As the time drew near that date Wallin was besieged for information as to the validity of the said prediction . To the constantly repeated question , “ Is it true , Bishop , that the world shall perish on Thursday ? ” Wallin had always the same answer : “ Please call again on Friday , and I will let you know . ” The questioner withdrew consoled .</note>   <note xml:id="noteC" place="bottom" n="C">His great popularity with the masses naturally caused them to apply to him for all sorts of information and advice , with full confidence that he knew how to assist and advise in all matters .
