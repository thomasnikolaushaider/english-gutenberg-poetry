    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS ; BY THOMAS GENT .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint><settlement>LONDON</settlement></docImprint>
    <docDate><date>1828</date>. ADVERTISEMENT . Some of the Pieces in this volume have been separately published , at different times ; the indulgence , I may say favour , with which they were individually received , has encouraged me to collect and re-publish them . I have added many others , which are now first printed . I shall be well satisfied , if they find as favourable a reception as their precursors ; and are thought not to have increased the size , without at all increasing the merit , of the book . I cannot omit this opportunity of thanking those Critics , who have honoured me by reviewing my verses . I owe them my warm acknowledgments for candidly measuring my Poems by their pretensions . They have looked at them as they really were ;— as the amusements of the leisure hours of a man whose fortune will not favour his inclination to devote himself to poetry ; and conceiving a favourable opinion of them in that character , have kindly expressed it .</docDate>
    <docImprint><settlement>London</settlement>, December ,<date>1827</date>. During the progress of these pages through the press , it has pleased Providence to inflict upon me the severest calamity that domestic life can sustain . In the private sorrows of the humble candidate for literary fame , I am aware that the world will feel no interest , yet humanity will forgive the weakness that struggles under such a bereavement , and will pardon the tear that falls upon such a tomb . If , indeed , the Being who is lost to her family and society were endowed only with those gifts and graces , which are shared by thousands of her sex , I should have been silent at this moment . To those who knew her ,<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>and to know her was to esteem and love , this tribute will be superfluous ; but to those who knew her not , I would say , that , superadded to every natural advantage , to the charms of every polite accomplishment , and to a cheerful and sincere piety , she was deeply imbued with the love of literature and of science . In these , her Lectures on the Physiology of the External Senses exhibit a splendid proof of her acquirements in their highest walks , and are an imperishable memorial of her patient and laborious research . They who were present at the delivery of these Lectures will not soon forget the effect of her impressive elocution , chastened as it was by as unaffected modesty as ever adorned and dignified a woman . I speak of that which she performed — that which her capacious mind had meditated I forbear to mention . For the advancement of her sex in pursuits that are intellectual she made many sacrifices , both of her feelings and her time ; yet , in all she did , and in all she contemplated , usefulness was her end and aim — but I must not proceed ; less than this I could not say — more than this might be deemed ostentatious . What earthly tongue , and , oh ! what human pen Can tell that scene of suffering , too severe . ‘ Tis ever present to my sight , oh ! when Will the sound cease its torture on mine ear ? Oh ! my lost love , thou patient Being , never ! Thy dying look of love can I forget ; The last fond pressure of thy hand , for ever ! Thrills in my veins , I see thy struggles yet . Thy sculptured beauty is before me now : In thy calm dignity , and sweet repose , Alas ! sad memory re-invests thy brow , With death 's stern agony , and pain 's last throes . Desolate heart be still — forgive , oh God ! The cries of feeble nature stricken sore . Father ! assuage the terrors of thy rod . Teach me to see thy wisdom — and adore ! [ Footnote 1 : I cannot resist the melancholy gratification of quoting from the Literary Gazette , of August 18 , in which the death of Mrs. Gent was announced to the public .— “ Science has , since our last , suffered a severe lost by the death of this accomplished lady ; she was well known for her high attainments as a Lecturer , and her Course on the Physiology of the External Senses was a perfect model of elegant composition and refined oratory . Mrs. Gent died at the residence of her husband , Thomas Gent , Esq . Doctor 's Commons , after a month of severe suffering , which she bore with singular fortitude , and the most pious resignation . There is a fine bust of her , by Behnes ; it was in the Exhibition two years since , and , from its intrinsic simplicity and beauty alone , has had many casts made from it . ” And one of the most distinguished Poets of the present day , will , I am sure , forgive me if I quote his beautiful words in writing to me on this subject — for his talents she had the highest admiration , and no one was better able than himself to appreciate the excellence of her character .— “ As to condolence , I never condole — what condolence could any one offer for the loss of so estimable a being as has been lost to society in your accomplished wife ? I had a very great respect and esteem for her , and it would have highly gratified me to have been able to lighten the least of her trials ; but what avails writing or visiting on occasions of such real pain . She lived a most amiable being — and for such there is the highest hope in the Highest World . If I had conceived that her illness was at all serious , I should have gone to gather wisdom from her for my own hour — but now , that all her anxieties are past , I can invent no condolence . ” ]</docImprint>

     <item>POEMS .</item>
     <item>Tis sweet in boyhood 's visionary mood , When glowing Fancy , innocently gay , Flings forth , like motes , her bright aërial brood , To dance and shine in Hope 's prolific ray ; ‘ Tis sweet , unweeting how the flight of years May darkling roll in trials and in tears , To dress the future in what garb we list , And shape the thousand joys that never may exist . But he , sad wight ! of all that feverish train , Fool 'd by those phantoms of the wizard brain , Most wildly dotes , whom young ambition stings To trust his weight upon poetic wings ; He , downward looking in his airy ride , Beholds Elysium bloom on every side ; Unearthly bliss each thrilling nerve attunes , And thus the dreamer with himself communes . Yes ! Earth shall witness , ‘ ere my star be set , That partial nature mark 'd me for her pet ; That Phoebus doom 'd me , kind indulgent sire ! To mount his car , and set the world on fire . Fame 's steep ascent by easy flights to win , With a neat pocket volume I 'll begin ; And dirge , and sonnet , ode , and epigram , Shall show mankind how versatile I am . The buskin 'd Muse shall next my pen descry : The boxes from their inmost rows shall sigh ; The pit shall weep , the galleries deplore Such moving woes as ne'er were heard before : Enough — I 'll leave them in their soft hysterics , Mount , in a brighter blaze , and dazzle with Homerics .</item>
     <item>Then , while my name runs ringing through Reviews , And maids , wives , widows , smitten with my Muse , Assail me with Platonic billet-doux . From this suburban attic I 'll dismount , With Coutts or Barclays open an account ; Ranged in my mirror , cards , with burnish 'd ends , Shall show the whole nobility my friends ; That happy host with whom I choose to dine , Shall make set-parties , give his-choicest wine ; And age and infancy shall gape to see The lucky bard , and whisper “ That is he ! ”</item>

    <docImprint>Poor youth ! he print — and wakes , to sleep no more — The world goes on , indifferent , as before ; And the first notice of his metric skill Comes in the likeness of — his printer 's bill ; To pen soft notes no fair enthusiast stirs , Except his laundress — and who values her 's ? None but herself : for though the bard may burn Her note , she still expects one in return . The luckless maiden , all unblest shall sigh ; His pocket tome hath drawn his pockets dry . His tragedy expires in peals of laughter ; And that soul-thrilling wish — to live hereafter — Gives way to one as hopeless quite , I fear , And far more needful — how to live while here . Where are ye now , divine illusions all ; Cheques , dinners , wines , admirers great and small ! Changed to two followers , terrible to see , Who dog his walks , and whisper “ That is he ! ” Rhymesters attend ! nor scorn &amp; friendly hint , Restrain your cacoëths fierce to print . But hark , my printer 's devil 's at the door , My leisure cannot yield one moment more : Nor matters it , advice can ne'er restrain Madman or poet from his bent :— ‘ tis vain To strive to point out colours to the blind , Or set men seeking what they will not find . MATURE REFLECTIONS . O Love ! divinest dream of youth , Thy day of ecstacy is o'er , My bosom , touch 'd by time and truth , Thrills at thy dear deceits no more . Nor thou , Ambition ! e'er again , With splendour dazzling to betray , And aspirations fierce and vain , Shall tempt my steps — away ! away ! Alas ! by stern Experience cleft , When life 's romance is turn 'd to sport ; If man hath consolation left On this side death — ‘ tis good old port . And thou , Advice ! who glum and chill , Do'st the third bottle still gainsay ; Smile , and partake it , if you will , But if you wont — away ! away ! THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Lives there who , with unhallow 'd hand , would tear , One leaf from that immortal wreath which shades The Hero 's living brow , or decks his urn ? Breathes there who does not triumph in the thought That “ Nelson 's language is his mother tongue , ” And that St. Vincent 's country is his own ? Oh ! these bright guerdons of renown are won By means most palpable to sense and sight ; By days of peril and by nights of toil ; By Valour 's long probation , closed at last In Victory 's arms — consummated and seal 'd In deathless Glory and immortal Fame . Musing I stand upon his lowly grave , Who , though he fought no battle — though he pour 'd No hostile thunders on his country 's foes , Achieved for Britain triumphs , less array 'd “ In pomp and circumstance , ” nor visible To vulgar gaze — the triumphs of the Mind . He nursed the elements of courage — he Supplied the aliment that feeds and guides The daring spirit to its high emprise — A nation 's moral energies , by him Directed , found a nobler end and aim . He gave that high discriminating tone That marks the Brave from mercenary tools — Features that separate a British Crew From hireling bravoes , and from pirate hordes . And yet no marble marks the spot where lies The dust of DIBDIN ;— no inscription speaks A Nation 's gratitude — a Bard 's desert . The youthful Sailor on his midnight watch , Fixing his gaze upon the tranquil moon , Felt his heart soften as the thoughts of home Rush 'd on his faithful memory ;— then it was In language meet , and in appropriate strains — Strains which thy lyre had taught him — he pour 'd forth The feelings of his soul , and all was calm . Thy Spirit still presides in that carouse , When to “ the Far away ” the toast is given , And “ absent Wives and Sweethearts ” claim their right , With Woman 's constancy thy songs are rife ; And this pure creed still teaches Man t ’ endure Privations , danger , and each form of death . When not a breath responded to the call , And Seamen whistled to the winds in vain ; When the loose canvass droop 'd in lazy folds , And idle pennants dangled from the mast ;— There , in that trying moment , thou wert found To teach the hardest lesson man can learn — Passive endurance — and the breeze has sprung , As if obedient to the voice of Song :— And yet unhonour 'd here thy ashes lie ! A nobler lesson learn 'd the gallant Tar From his Orphean lyre — to temper right The lion 's courage with the attributes That to the gentle and the meek belong ; O'er fallen foes to check the eye of fire — O'er fallen foes to soften heart of oak . He turn 'd the Fatalist 's rash eye to Him In whom the issues are of life and death ; He taught to whom the battle is — to whom The victory belongs . His cherub , that aloft Kept sleepless watch , was Providence — not Chance . And yet no honours are decreed for him — Friend of the Brave , thy memory cannot die ! Th'inquiring voice , that eagerly demands Where rest thy ashes ?— shall preserve thy fame . Thine immortality thyself hast wrought ;— Familiar as the terms of art , thy verse , Thine own peculiar words are still the mode In which the Seaman aptly would express His honest passions and his manly thoughts ; His feelings kindle at thy burning words , Which speak his duty in the battle 's front ; His parting whisper to the maid he loves Is breathed in eloquence he learned from thee ; Thou art his Oracle in every mood — His trump of victory — his lyre of love ! A SKETCH FROM LIFE . She sat in beauty , like some form of nymph Or naïad , on the mossy , purpled bank Of her wild woodland stream , that at her feet Linger 'd , and play 'd , and dimpled , as in love . Or like those shapes that on the western clouds Spread gold-dropp 'd plumes , and sing to harps of pearl , And teach the evening winds their melody : How shall I tell her beauty ?— for the eye , Fix 'd on the sun , is blinded by its beam . One glance , and then no more , upon that brow Brighter than marble shining through those curls , Richer than hyacinths when they wave their bells In the low breathing of the twilight wind .— One glance upon that lip , beside whose hue The morning rose would sicken and grow pale , ‘ Till it was waked again by the soft breath That steals in music from those lips of love . Wert thou a statue I could pine for thee , But in thy living beauty there is awe ; The sacredness of modesty enshrines The ruby lip , bright brow , and beaming eye ;— I dare but worship what I must not love .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <note xml:id="note1_4" place="bottom" n="1">Dr. Abel was greatly distinguished in his profession for his love of it , and for the ardour of his pursuits in useful knowledge . — He published many ingenious Papers on Medical Science and Natural History . His account of the Embassy to China , under Lord Amherst , has been generally admired . He practised with increasing respect as a Physician , at Brighton , previous to his leaving England for India ; and meditated ( as the Author of this article knows ) one or two works , which , from the activity of his mind , may yet be anticipated . Dr. Abel was a native of Bungay , in Suffolk ( where his father was a banker ) , and it is supposed was about 35 years of age when he died . It is worthy of remark , that the present eminent and estimable Dr. Gooch , Librarian to His Majesty , and Dr. Abel , should both have been pupils of Mr. Borrett , Surgeon , of Yarmouth .</note>

      <head>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION .</head>
      <p>The very flattering success which attended the first Edition of this brief but affectionate Sketch , I must attribute to the interest of the subject , rather than the merit of the composition ; and I cannot but feel grateful to those Writers who have honoured me by their notice and approbation .</p>

     <titlePage>
      <docImprint>I must not again go to press , without acknowledging how much I am indebted to a kind friend , who happened to be in Norfolk at the time I was printing the first Edition ; with whom I had the happiness to pass many delightful hours , and to whose admirable taste and judgment I owe many valuable suggestions . In mentioning John Kemble with Sheridan , I associate two of the brightest stars that have illumined the Literature and Drama of the Country . T. G .

       <l n="4">Oh ! what serenity remains within !</l>
       <l n="5">For there contentment , health , and peace , abide ,</l>
       <l n="6">And pillow 'd age , with calm eye fix 'd above ;</l>
       <l n="7">Labour 's bold son , his blithe and blooming bride ,</l>
       <l n="8">And lisping innocence , and filial love .</l>
       <l n="9">To such a scene let proud Ambition turn ,</l>
       <l n="10">Whose aching breast conceals its secret woe ;</l>
       <l n="11">Then shall his fireful spirit melt , and mourn</l>
       <l n="12">The mild enjoyments it can never know ;</l>
       <l n="13">Then shall he feel the littleness of state ,</l>
       <l n="14">And sigh that fortune e'er had made him great .</l>

       <l n="2">Southey ! high placed on the contested throne</l>
       <l n="3">Of modern verse , a Muse , herself unknown ,</l>
       <l n="4">Sues that her tears may consecrate the strains</l>
       <l n="5">Pour 'd o'er the urn enrich 'd with WHITE 'S Remains !</l>
       <l n="6">While touch 'd to transport , Taste 's responding tone</l>
       <l n="7">Makes the rapt poet 's ecstasies thine own ;</l>
       <l n="8">Ah ! think that he , whose hand supremely skill 'd ,</l>
       <l n="9">The heart 's fine chords with deep vibration thrill 'd ,</l>
       <l n="10">In stagnant silence and petrific gloom ,</l>
       <l n="11">Unconscious sleeps , the tenant of the tomb !</l>
       <l n="12">Extinct that spirit , whose strong-bidding drew</l>
       <l n="13">From Fancy 's confines Wonder 's wild-eyed crew ,</l>
       <l n="14">Which bade Despair 's terrific phantoms pass</l>
       <l n="15">Like Macbeth 's monarchs in the mystic glass .</l>
       <l n="16">Before the youthful bard 's impassion 'd eye ,</l>
       <l n="17">Like him , led on , to triumph and to die ;</l>
       <l n="18">Like him , by mighty magic compass 'd round ,</l>
       <l n="19">And seeking sceptres on enchanted ground .</l>
       <l n="20">Such spells invest , such blear illusion waits</l>
       <l n="21">The trav'ller bound for Fame 's receding gates ,</l>
       <l n="22">Delusive splendours gild the proud abode ,</l>
       <l n="23">But lurking demons haunt th ’ alluring road ;</l>
       <l n="24">There gaunt-eyed Want asserts her iron reign ,</l>
       <l n="25">There , as in vengeance of the world 's disdain ,</l>
       <l n="26">This half-flesh 'd hag midst Wit 's bright blossoms stalks ,</l>
       <l n="27">And , breathing winter , withers where she walks ;</l>
       <l n="28">Though there , long outlaw 'd , desp'rate with disgrace ,</l>
       <l n="29">Invidious Dulness wields the critic mace ,</l>
       <l n="30">And sworn in hate , exerts his ruffian might</l>
       <l n="31">Where'er young genius meditates his flight .</l>
       <l n="32">Erewhile , when WHITE , by this fell fiend oppress 'd ,</l>
       <l n="33">Felt Hope 's fine fervours languish in his breast ,</l>
       <l n="34">When shrunk with scorn , and trembling to aspire ,</l>
       <l n="35">He dropp 'd desponding his insulted lyre .</l>
       <l n="36">Alert in zeal , with art benigh endued ,</l>
       <l n="37">SOUTHEY ! thy hand his blasted strength renew 'd ,</l>
       <l n="38">And lured him on , his labours scarce begun ,</l>
       <l n="39">To win those laurels which thyself had won .</l>
       <l n="40">In vain ! though vivified with pristine force ,</l>
       <l n="41">O'er learning 's realms he shot with meteor course ;</l>
       <l n="42">To worth relentless , Fate 's despotic frown</l>
       <l n="43">Scowl 'd in the bright perspective of renown :</l>
       <l n="44">Timeless he falls , in Death 's pale triumph led .</l>
       <l n="45">And his first laurels shade his grassy bed .</l>
       <l n="46">So sinks the Muse 's offspring , doom 'd to try ,</l>
       <l n="47">Like a caged eagle panting tow'rds the sky ,</l>
       <l n="48">A foil 'd ascent , while adverse fortune flings</l>
       <l n="49">Her strong link 'd meshes o'er his flutt'ring wings ,</l>
       <l n="50">Sinks , while exalted Ignorance supine ,</l>
       <l n="51">Unheeded slumbers like the pamper 'd swine ;</l>
       <l n="52">Obsequious slaves in his voluptuous bowers</l>
       <l n="53">Young pleasures warble , while the dancing Hours</l>
       <l n="54">In sickly sweetness languishingly move ,</l>
       <l n="55">Like new-waked virgins flush 'd with dreams of love —</l>
       <l n="56">Him , when by Death 's dark angel swept away</l>
       <l n="57">From sloth 's embrace , in premature decay ,</l>
       <l n="58">Surviving friends , donation 'd into grief ,</l>
       <l n="59">Shall mourn with anguish audible and brief ,</l>
       <l n="60">And pander-bards ring round in goodly chime</l>
       <l n="61">His liberal heart , high wit , and soul sublime ;</l>
       <l n="62">But Flattery 's frauds impartial Time disowns ,</l>
       <l n="63">Funereal pomp , and adulative tones ;</l>
       <l n="64">Slow where she moves through monumental aisles ,</l>
       <l n="65">With stern contempt insulted Reason smiles ,</l>
       <l n="66">While Falsehood , shrined above th ’ emblazon 'd palls ,</l>
       <l n="67">Shames sanctity from consecrated walls :</l>
       <l n="68">She seeks , with pensive step and saintly eyes ,</l>
       <l n="69">Some lonely grave , where rude the grass-tufts rise ;</l>
       <l n="70">Nor sculptured angels tell , nor chisell 'd lines ,</l>
       <l n="71">There slumbers CHATTERTON — here WHITE reclines !</l>
       <l n="72">But nobler triumphs WHITE 'S probation claims</l>
       <l n="73">Than ever blazon 'd Wit 's recorded names ;</l>
       <l n="74">For Virtue 's sons , to bliss immortal born ,</l>
       <l n="75">Tower to their native heaven , and view with scorn</l>
       <l n="76">The vain distinction of the trophied sod ,</l>
       <l n="77">‘ Tis theirs to gain distinction with their God !</l>

       <l n="17">Ah , sad reverse ! too soon the fated hour</l>

       <l n="25">Yet not a friend beheld thy parting breath ,</l>

       <l n="27">No priest proclaim 'd the erring hour forgiven ,</l>
       <l n="28">Or sooth 'd thy spirit to its native heav'n :</l>
       <l n="29">But Heaven , more bounteous , bade the pilgrim come ,</l>
