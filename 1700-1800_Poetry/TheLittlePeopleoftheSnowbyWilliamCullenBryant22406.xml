     <l n="20">Uncle John .— Listen to me , then .</l>
     <l n="21">‘ Twas in the olden time , long , long ago ,</l>
     <l n="22">And long before the great oak at our door</l>
     <l n="23">Was yet an acorn , on a mountain 's side</l>
     <l n="24">Lived , with his wife , a cottager . They dwelt</l>
     <l n="25">Beside a glen and near a dashing brook ,</l>
     <l n="26">A pleasant spot in spring , where first the wren</l>
     <l n="27">Was heard to chatter , and , among the grass ,</l>
     <l n="28">Flowers opened earliest ; but , when winter came ,</l>
     <l n="29">That little brook was fringed with other flowers ,—</l>
     <l n="30">White flowers , with crystal leaf and stem , that grew</l>
     <l n="31">In clear November nights . And , later still ,</l>
     <l n="32">That mountain glen was filled with drifted snows</l>
     <l n="33">From side to side , that one might walk across ,</l>
     <l n="34">While , many a fathom deep , below , the brook</l>
     <l n="35">Sang to itself , and leaped and trotted on</l>
     <l n="36">Unfrozen , o'er its pebbles , toward the vale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="37">Alice .— A mountain 's side , you said ; the Alps , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or our own Alleghanies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="39">Uncle John .— Not so fast ,</l>
     <l n="40">My young geographer , for then the Alps ,</l>
     <l n="41">With their broad pastures , haply were untrod</l>
     <l n="42">Of herdsman 's foot , and never human voice</l>
     <l n="43">Had sounded in the woods that overhang</l>
     <l n="44">Our Alleghany 's streams . I think it was</l>
     <l n="45">Upon the slopes of the great Caucasus ,</l>
     <l n="46">Or where the rivulets of Ararat</l>
     <l n="47">Seek the Armenian vales . That mountain rose</l>
     <l n="48">So high , that , on its top , the winter snow</l>
     <l n="49">Was never melted , and the cottagers</l>
     <l n="50">Among the summer blossoms , far below ,</l>
     <l n="51">Saw its white peaks in August from their door .</l>

     <l n="65">When autumn days grew pale , there came a troop</l>
     <l n="66">Of childlike forms from that cold mountain top ;</l>
     <l n="67">With trailing garments through the air they came ,</l>
     <l n="68">Or walked the ground with girded loins , and threw</l>
     <l n="69">Spangles of silvery frost upon the grass ,</l>
     <l n="70">And edged the brook with glistening parapets ,</l>
     <l n="71">And built it crystal bridges , touched the pool ,</l>
     <l n="72">And turned its face to glass , or , rising thence ,</l>
     <l n="73">They shook , from their full laps , the soft , light snow ,</l>
     <l n="74">And buried the great earth , as autumn winds</l>
     <l n="75">Bury the forest floor in heaps of leaves .</l>

     <l n="84">They smote him with their heaviest snow-flakes , flung</l>
     <l n="85">Needles of frost in handfuls at his cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="86">And , of the light wreaths of his smoking breath ,</l>
     <l n="87">Wove a white fringe for his brown beard , and laughed</l>
     <l n="88">Their slender laugh to see him wink and grin</l>
     <l n="89">And make grim faces as he floundered on .</l>

     <l n="92">To them the sun 's warm beams were shafts of fire ,</l>

     <l n="196">Drooped by the winding walks ; yet all seemed wrought</l>
     <l n="197">Of stainless alabaster ; up the trees</l>
     <l n="198">Ran the lithe jessamine , with stalk and leaf</l>
     <l n="199">Colorless as her flowers . “ Go softly on , ”</l>
     <l n="200">Said the snow-maiden ; “ touch not , with thy hand ,</l>
     <l n="201">The frail creation round thee , and beware</l>
     <l n="202">To sweep it with thy skirts . Now look above .</l>
     <l n="203">How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up</l>
     <l n="204">With shifting gleams that softly come and go !</l>
     <l n="205">These are the northern lights , such as thou seest</l>
     <l n="206">In the midwinter nights , cold , wandering flames ,</l>
     <l n="207">That float , with our processions , through the air ;</l>
     <l n="208">And here , within our winter palaces ,</l>
     <l n="209">Mimic the glorious daybreak . ” Then she told</l>
     <l n="210">How , when the wind , in the long winter nights ,</l>
     <l n="211">Swept the light snows into the hollow dell ,</l>
     <l n="212">She and her comrades guided to its place</l>
     <l n="213">Each wandering flake , and piled them quaintly up ,</l>
     <l n="214">In shapely colonnade and glistening arch ,</l>
     <l n="215">With shadowy aisles between , or bade them grow</l>
     <l n="216">Beneath their little hands , to bowery walks</l>
     <l n="217">In gardens such as these , and , o'er them all ,</l>
     <l n="218">Built the broad roof . “ But thou hast yet to see</l>
     <l n="219">A fairer sight , ” she said , and led the way</l>
     <l n="220">To where a window of pellucid ice</l>
     <l n="221">Stood in the wall of snow , beside their path .</l>
     <l n="222">“ Look , but thou mayst not enter . ” Eva looked ,</l>
     <l n="223">And lo ! a glorious hall , from whose high vault</l>
     <l n="224">Stripes of soft light , ruddy , and delicate green ,</l>
     <l n="225">And tender blue , flowed downward to the floor</l>
     <l n="226">And far around , as if the aerial hosts ,</l>
     <l n="227">That march on high by night , with beamy spears ,</l>
     <l n="228">And streaming banners , to that place had brought</l>

     <l n="236">And in all that hall a joyous multitude</l>
     <l n="237">Of those by whom its glistening walls were reared ,</l>
     <l n="238">Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds ,</l>
     <l n="239">That rang from cymbals of transparent ice ,</l>
     <l n="240">And ice-cups , quivering to the skilful touch</l>
     <l n="241">Of little fingers . Round and round they flew ,</l>
     <l n="242">As when , in spring , about a chimney-top ,</l>
     <l n="243">A cloud of twittering swallows , just returned ,</l>
     <l n="244">Wheel round and round , and turn and wheel again ,</l>
     <l n="245">Unwinding their swift track . So rapidly</l>
     <l n="246">Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance ,</l>
     <l n="247">Beneath that dome of light . Bright eyes that looked</l>
     <l n="248">From under lily brows , and gauzy scarfs</l>
     <l n="249">Sparkling like snow-wreaths in the early sun ,</l>
     <l n="250">Shot by the window in their mazy whirl .</l>
     <l n="251">And there stood Eva , wondering at the sight</l>
     <l n="252">Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep</l>
     <l n="253">Of motion as they passed her ;— long she gazed ,</l>
     <l n="254">And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled</l>
     <l n="255">The frosty air , till now the encroaching cold</l>
     <l n="256">Recalled her to herself . “ Too long , too long</l>
     <l n="257">I linger here , ” she said , and then she sprang</l>
     <l n="258">Into the path , and with a hurried step</l>
     <l n="259">Followed it upward . Ever by her side</l>
     <l n="260">Her little guide kept pace . As on they went</l>
     <l n="261">Eva bemoaned her fault : “ What must they think —</l>
     <l n="262">The dear ones in the cottage , while so long ,</l>
     <l n="263">Hour after hour , I stay without ? I know</l>
     <l n="264">That they will seek me far and near , and weep</l>
     <l n="265">To find me not . How could I , wickedly ,</l>
     <l n="266">Neglect the charge they gave me ? ” As she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="267">The hot tears started to her eyes ; she knelt</l>
     <l n="268">In the mid path . “ Father ! forgive this sin ;</l>
     <l n="269">Forgive myself I cannot ” — thus she prayed ,</l>
     <l n="270">And rose and hastened onward . When , at last ,</l>
     <l n="271">They reached the outer air , the clear north breathed</l>
     <l n="272">A bitter cold , from which she shrank with dread ,</l>
     <l n="273">But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt</l>
     <l n="274">The cutting blast , and uttered shouts of joy ,</l>
     <l n="275">And skipped , with boundless glee , from drift to drift ,</l>
     <l n="276">And danced round Eva , as she labored up</l>
     <l n="277">The mounds of snow , “ Ah me ! I feel my eyes</l>
     <l n="278">Grow heavy , ” Eva said ; “ they swim with sleep ;</l>
     <l n="279">I cannot walk for utter weariness ,</l>
     <l n="280">And I must rest a moment on this bank ,</l>
     <l n="281">But let it not be long . ” As thus she spoke ,</l>
     <l n="282">In half-formed words , she sank on the smooth snow ,</l>
     <l n="283">With closing lids . Her guide composed the robe</l>
     <l n="284">About her limbs , and said , “ A pleasant spot</l>
     <l n="285">Is this to slumber in ; on such a couch</l>
     <l n="286">Oft have I slept away the winter night ,</l>
     <l n="287">And had the sweetest dreams . ” So Eva slept ,</l>
     <l n="288">But slept in death ; for when the power of frost</l>
     <l n="289">Locks up the motions of the living frame ,</l>
     <l n="290">The victim passes to the realm of Death</l>
     <l n="291">Through the dim porch of Sleep . The little guide ,</l>
     <l n="292">Watching beside her , saw the hues of life</l>
     <l n="293">Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek ,</l>
     <l n="294">As fades the crimson from a morning cloud ,</l>
     <l n="295">Till they were white as marble , and the breath</l>
     <l n="296">Had ceased to come and go , yet knew she not</l>
     <l n="297">At first that this was death . But when she marked</l>
     <l n="298">How deep the paleness was , how motionless</l>
     <l n="299">That once lithe form , a fear came over her .</l>
     <l n="300">She strove to wake the sleeper , plucked her robe ,</l>
     <l n="301">And shouted in her ear , but all in vain ;</l>
     <l n="302">The life had passed away from those young limbs .</l>
     <l n="303">Then the snow-maiden raised a wailing cry ,</l>
     <l n="304">Such as a dweller in some lonely wild ,</l>
     <l n="305">Sleepless through all the long December night ,</l>
     <l n="306">Hears when the mournful East begins to blow .</l>

     <l n="314">Were seeking Eva ; from afar they saw</l>

     <l n="318">Of the snow-maiden , mortal anguish fell</l>
     <l n="319">Upon their hearts , and bitter words of grief</l>
