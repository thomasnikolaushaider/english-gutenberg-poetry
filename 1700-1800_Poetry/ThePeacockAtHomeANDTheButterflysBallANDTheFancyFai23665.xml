   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The Rip . A machine used in poultry-yards , under which it is usual to confine the mother-bird with the young brood , till it has acquired strength to follow her . The word is derived from the Saxon Hrip , meaning a covering , or protection , for the young .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The Tailor-Bird . So called from the singular manner in which it constructs its nest , which is composed of two leaves , sewed together with wonderful skill by the little tailor , whose bill serves him for a needle , and the fine fibres of leaves furnish him with a substitute for thread , by which means he attaches a dead leaf to a living one , growing at the end of a branch . The Tailor-Bird is an inhabitant of India .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The Golden-crested Wren is the smallest of the British Birds ; it takes its name from a circle of gold-coloured feathers , bordered with black , forming an arch above its eyes , which it has the power of raising or depressing ; it is a native of every part of Europe , and is also to be found in Asia and America .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>Halcyon , or Kingfisher . Esteemed the most beautiful of our native birds ; but its form is clumsy , and its bill very disproportionate to its size . It inhabits the banks of rivers and streams , where it will sit for hours on a projecting branch , watching for its prey . The ancients relate many fabulous stories of this bird , as that of its laying its eggs in the depth of winter , and that during the time of its incubation the weather remains perfectly calm , whence the expression Halcyon days .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Cuculus indicator . A bird of the Cuckoo kind , found in the interior parts of Africa ; it has a shrill note , which the natives answer by a soft whistle ; and the birds repeating the note , the natives are thereby conducted to the wild Bee-hives , which this bird frequents .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Cassowary . A large singular bird found in the island of Java , in Africa , and the southern parts of India . The head of this bird is armed with a kind of natural helmet , extending from the base of the bill to near half-way over the head .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>Flamingo . A bird of the crane kind , but web-footed , whose plumage is of a bright scarlet : when standing erect , it measures above six feet , though its body is not larger than that of a Goose ; and is a native of Africa , Persia , and South America .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>Ptarmigan . The white grouse , or white game , inhabits the Highlands of Scotland and the Western Islands ; it prefers the coldest situations on the highest mountains , where it burrows under the snow . It changes its feathers twice in the year , and about the end of February puts on its summer dress of dusky brown , ash , and orange-coloured feathers ; which it loses in winter for a plumage perfectly white , except a black line between the bill and the eye . The legs and toes are warmly clothed with a thick long coat of soft white feathers .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>The Chough . This bird , which is about the size of the Daw , has a long curved bill , sharp at the point , which , as well as the legs and feet , is of a bright scarlet , contrasting beautifully with its black plumage , which varies , as the light falls on it , to a deep purple violet . Its general haunts are the crevices of high cliffs in Devonshire and Cornwall .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>The Widow , or Widah Bird , is a species of Bunting , a native of Angola and other parts of Africa ; and is remarkable for the feathers of its tail . The two middle ones are about four inches long , and ending in a long thread ; the two next are thirteen inches in length , broad , and narrowing towards the points : from these proceeds another long thread .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Yaffil , the Woodpecker . The name Yaffil is provincial , but is so very expressive of the noise it continually makes , that I have preferred it on that account . It is a beautiful bird , and is sometimes called the English Parrot ; the colour of its plumage , green , yellow , and scarlet , giving it some resemblance to that bird .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>The Numidian Crane , or Demoiselle , from the elegance of its appearance , and its singular carriage , is called the Demoiselle , which means the Young Lady ; for this bird walks very gracefully , and sometimes skips and leaps , as though it were trying to dance .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>Guillemot . A sea-bird , of which there are several species numerously spread over the northern world ; from whence they come towards winter to the British shores , and remain till they have reared their young . It is sometimes called “ the foolish Guillemot , ” from its stupidity ; for when their companions are shot one after another , they have so little sense of danger , that they make a small circuit , and then return and settle in the same place , to share the same fate .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>Toucan . A native of America , where it builds in the hollows of trees , and sits at the entrance , ready to peck at the monkeys , who often endeavour to destroy and eat the young . It is about the size of a Magpie , but the head large in proportion , to enable it to support its immense bill , which is six inches and one-half in length , but extremely thin . It is a mild inoffensive bird , and easily tamed , but cannot endure the cold of our climate . The feathers of the breast are highly esteemed by the natives .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Cross-bill . So called because the two mandibles cross each other in different directions . They feed chiefly on the seeds of fir-trees ; the singular construction of their bills being admirably adapted to separate the seeds of the cones . The pips of apples are also a favourite food , and , to obtain them , they split the apple with one stroke of their bill ; they are consequently found to be very injurious to orchards . It has been observed that they have been more frequently seen in England since the fir-tree has been more generally planted than formerly .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>Siskin . A migratory bird , which is seen in the southern parts of England at the time of the barley harvest , and is sometimes called the Barley-bird . It has a pleasing note , and is sold as a singing-bird in the London bird-shops by the name of the Aberdevine . The accusation of its flirtation with the Greenfinch is to be understood as pure scandal , the most prying naturalists never having discovered any particular attachment between them .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>Razor-bill . A migratory sea-bird , which visits the northern shores in spring , and leaves them in winter : they lay a single egg on the ledges of the rocks without any nest , and on which it is said to be fixed with a cement .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>Spoon-bill . So called from the construction of the bill , which is flat the whole length , but widens towards the end in the form of a spoon or spatula ; and is equally remarkable in its substance , not being hard like bone , but flexible like whalebone . They feed on snakes , worms , frogs , and fish , even on shell-fish , which they first break with their bills .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>The Agami , or Trumpeter . A native of America , remarkable for a singular noise , resembling the instrument from which it takes its name .</p>
   <p>THE BUTTERFLY 'S BALL , AND THE GRASSHOPPER 'S FEAST .</p>

     <l n="5">So said little Robert , and pacing along ,</l>
     <l n="6">His merry Companions came forth in a throng ,</l>
     <l n="7">And on the smooth Grass , by the side of a Wood</l>
     <l n="8">Beneath a broad Oak that for ages had stood ,</l>
     <l n="9">Saw the Children of Earth , and the Tenants of Air ,</l>
     <l n="10">For an Evening 's Amusement together repair .</l>
     <l n="11">And there came the Beetle , so blind and so black ,</l>
     <l n="12">Who carried the Emmet , his Friend , on his back</l>
     <l n="13">And there was the Gnat , and the Dragon-fly too ,</l>
     <l n="14">With all their Relations , Green , Orange , and Blue .</l>
     <l n="15">And there came the Moth , with his plumage of down ,</l>
     <l n="16">And the Hornet , in Jacket of Yellow and Brown ;</l>
     <l n="17">Who with him the Wasp , his Companion , did bring ,</l>
     <l n="18">But they promised that Evening to lay by their Sting .</l>
     <l n="19">And the sly little Dormouse crept out of his hole ,</l>
     <l n="20">And brought to the Feast his blind Brother , the Mole .</l>
     <l n="21">And the Snail , with his Horns peeping out of his Shell ,</l>
     <l n="22">Came from a great distance , the Length of an Ell .</l>
     <l n="23">A Mushroom their Table , and on it was laid</l>
     <l n="24">A Water-dock Leaf , which a Table-cloth made .</l>
     <l n="25">The Viands were various , to each of their taste ,</l>
     <l n="26">And the Bee brought her Honey to crown the Repast .</l>
     <l n="27">Then close on his haunches , so solemn and wise ,</l>
     <l n="28">The Frog from a corner look 'd up to the Skies ;</l>
     <l n="29">And the Squirrel , well pleased such diversions to see ,</l>
     <l n="30">Mounted high over-head , and look 'd down from a Tree .</l>
     <l n="31">Then out came the Spider , with finger so fine ,</l>
     <l n="32">To show his dexterity on the tight line .</l>
     <l n="33">From one branch to another his Cobwebs he slung ,</l>
     <l n="34">Then quick as an arrow he darted along ;</l>
     <l n="35">But just in the middle ,— Oh ! shocking to tell ,</l>
     <l n="36">From his rope in an instant poor Harlequin fell .</l>
     <l n="37">Yet he touch 'd not the ground , but with talons outspread</l>
     <l n="38">Hung suspended in air , at the end of a thread .</l>
     <l n="39">Then the Grasshopper came with a jerk and a spring ;</l>
     <l n="40">Very long was his Leg , though but short was his Wing :</l>
     <l n="41">He took but three leaps , and was soon out of sight ,</l>
     <l n="42">Then chirp 'd his own praises the rest of the night .</l>
     <l n="43">With step so majestic the Snail did advance ,</l>
     <l n="44">And promised the Gazers a Minuet to dance .</l>
     <l n="45">But they all laugh 'd so loud that he pull 'd in his head ,</l>
     <l n="46">And went in his own little chamber to bed .</l>
     <l n="47">Then , as Evening gave way to the Shadows of Night ,</l>
     <l n="48">Their Watchman , the Glowworm , came out with a light .</l>

     <l n="1">Some years are elapsed , and some worthies are gone ,</l>
     <l n="2">Since Peacocks and Butterflies mimick 'd the ton ,</l>
     <l n="3">And gave , in a manner becoming their station ,</l>
     <l n="4">Their fêtes and their balls to their fellow-creation .</l>
     <l n="5">Then Roscoe and Dorset , high-talented elves ,</l>
     <l n="6">Amused other people and solaced themselves ,</l>
     <l n="7">In describing the revels , the gibes , and the jokes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Of the creatures of earth , and the feathery folks ;</l>
     <l n="9">Of their fashion and fancy , the ebbs and the flows ,</l>
     <l n="10">And the beauty and wit of their belles and their beaux .</l>
     <l n="11">But the world has spun round like a peg top since then ,</l>
     <l n="12">And imparted more knowledge to brutes and to men ;</l>
     <l n="13">New lights and perceptions old customs explode ,</l>
     <l n="14">And what is done now , must be done à-la-mode .</l>
     <l n="15">Old fashions are fled , and what more can we say</l>
     <l n="16">Than that Dorset and Roscoe might do for that day ,</l>
     <l n="17">But that Poets must deck in more dignified rhymes</l>
     <l n="18">The wonderful deeds of these wonderful times ?</l>
     <l n="19">That Augusta may spread her renown and her glory ,</l>
     <l n="20">Her famed Fancy Fairs must be studded in story ,</l>

     <l n="22">Of the Gardens that bloom on the south of the Thames .</l>
     <l n="23">Old Dryden the bard was at best but a gander ,</l>
     <l n="24">In singing the Feast of the great Alexander ;</l>
     <l n="25">For what breast with the fumes of a banquet is fired</l>
     <l n="26">Two thousand years after the guests have retired ?</l>
     <l n="27">Our happier bard takes the season that suits ,</l>
     <l n="28">At the spur of the moment he puts on his boots ,</l>
     <l n="29">All hot for Parnassus , and cries in a hurry ,</l>
     <l n="30">“ Prepare me my Pegasus ! ‘ Saddle white Surrey ! ’ ”</l>
     <l n="31">It is clear that he feels what his numbers prolong ,</l>
     <l n="32">That he warms with his subject , and soars in his song .</l>
     <l n="33">But whether his lot be unhonour 'd and low ,</l>

     <l n="35">With the world to admire him , mysterious elf !</l>
     <l n="36">Is a secret of state that he keeps to himself .</l>
     <l n="37">But come ! Zoological wonders require</l>
     <l n="38">The strains of his genius , his force and his fire ;</l>

     <l n="43">Who proclaim 'd , with a feeling of pride in his breast ,</l>
     <l n="44">That the Gardens of Surrey were fairest and best .</l>
     <l n="45">Then at once the shrill tidings were borne on the air ,</l>
     <l n="46">That the dawn had arrived of the famed Fancy Fair ,</l>

     <l n="52">And trees in their livery of liveliest green .</l>
     <l n="53">The voice of rejoicing , from children of earth ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="65">Much pains had been taken to add to the grace ,</l>

     <l n="75">The Green-bonnet Monkey , with speckles bespread ,</l>

     <l n="77">For it look 'd , as he leap 'd in his frolic and joy ,</l>
     <l n="78">Like the top of the turban of Rammohun Roy .</l>
     <l n="79">Dame Tortoise roam 'd over the green and beyond ,</l>
     <l n="80">For she pass 'd on her pilgrimage right to the pond .</l>
     <l n="81">As she gazed on the Crocodile softly she sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="82">Though she thought that his mouth was a little too wide .</l>
     <l n="83">The Zebra look 'd sprightly , as every one saw ,</l>

     <l n="89">With a soft , silky , aspect , demure and profound ,</l>
     <l n="90">A tabby Cat wander 'd the Gardens around ,</l>
     <l n="91">And purr 'd her applause with a quiet delight ,</l>
     <l n="92">As she gazed half-entranced on the heart-cheering sight .</l>
     <l n="93">Among the rare wonders that caught every eye ,</l>
     <l n="94">Demanding a glance from the gay passer-by ,</l>
     <l n="95">Was the Alpaca , Zebu of Indian race ,</l>
     <l n="96">And the Camel , brought up in that beautiful place .</l>
     <l n="97">A dome in the centre , deservedly praised ,</l>
     <l n="98">Transparent as crystal , was artfully raised ,</l>
     <l n="99">Where African Lions , and Tigers untamed ,</l>
     <l n="100">And Sloths and Hyænas , for savageness famed ,</l>
     <l n="101">And Leopards and Ladies , and Monsters and Men ,</l>

     <l n="111">The Juggler , with tricks and illusions came forth ,</l>
     <l n="112">And the Russians with musical horns from the North ,</l>

     <l n="195">Mother Magpie and Priscilla Parrot , in spite ,</l>
     <l n="196">Could talk without ceasing from morning to night ;</l>
     <l n="197">Spread abroad Entre nous and On dits by the score ,</l>
     <l n="198">All the news they had heard , and a hundred times more .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="200">A multitude muster 'd , escaped from the plains ,</l>
     <l n="201">Of sight-loving lasses and holiday swains :</l>
     <l n="202">Bob Bantam push 'd forward and strutted before ;</l>
     <l n="203">Will Woodpecker modestly tapp 'd at the door ;</l>
     <l n="204">Poor Robin , the rustic , a countrified clown ,</l>
     <l n="205">As he blush 'd , look 'd too simple by half for the town ,</l>
     <l n="206">There were scores in brown mantles , black , yellow , or green ,</l>
     <l n="207">From the villages round , and among them were seen ,</l>
     <l n="208">Luke Linnet , Sam Swallow , Mat Martin , and then ,</l>
     <l n="209">Bill Bullfinch , Tom Titmouse , and Rosanna Wren .</l>
     <l n="210">But however select the fair party may be ,</l>
     <l n="211">Where beauty and fashion preside , we shall see</l>
     <l n="212">Some characters doubtful that all should beware ,</l>
     <l n="213">And it can n't be denied that a few such were there .</l>
     <l n="214">Those cut-throats the Sparrows , that robber the Daw ,</l>
     <l n="215">Who was pluck 'd for his open contempt of the law ;</l>
     <l n="216">The pilferer Cuckoo , whom all must despise ,</l>
     <l n="217">And the chattering Jay , who tells nothing but lies ;</l>
     <l n="218">While the green-mantled , light-hearted Love-birds , ‘ tis said ,</l>
     <l n="219">Had been sipping too much , for their noses were red .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="220">How often it is , when the sun is most bright ,</l>
     <l n="221">That a dark cloud approaches , obscuring his light !</l>
     <l n="222">Alas ! ‘ tis the same with all earthly affairs ,</l>
     <l n="223">And pleasure gives place to a dark crowd of cares .</l>
     <l n="224">The Trees were all lively , the Beasts were content ,</l>
     <l n="225">And the beautiful Birds on their pleasure were bent ,</l>
     <l n="226">Nothing doubting the multitude , struck with amaze ,</l>
     <l n="227">Came to gaze on their beauty and speak in their praise</l>
     <l n="228">When they saw that the crowd by degrees had retired ,</l>
     <l n="229">And that they left alone were no longer admired ;</l>
     <l n="230">They gazed on the Booths that were aptly design 'd</l>
     <l n="231">To display the fair merchandize art had combined ;</l>
     <l n="232">They look 'd on the spot in wrath , spleen , and despair ,</l>
     <l n="233">Rank , Beauty , Taste , Fashion , and Fancy were there ,</l>
     <l n="234">And the multitudes round such attractions preferr 'd</l>
     <l n="235">To a gambolling beast or a chattering bird .</l>
     <l n="236">Now Envy first enter 'd the fair feather 'd race ,</l>
     <l n="237">And invective and dissonance rung round the place ;</l>
     <l n="238">Their pleasure , their pride , and contentment were o'er ,</l>
     <l n="239">And Discord presided where Peace was before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="240">In the midst of the hubbub and riot around ,</l>
     <l n="241">The Trees were absorb 'd in a silence profound ,</l>
     <l n="242">Till the busy Dwarf Medlar began to explain</l>
     <l n="243">His rooted dislike to the booth-loving train .</l>
     <l n="244">He branch 'd out in florid descriptions to show</l>
     <l n="245">That they all ought to stand on their stumps in a row</l>
     <l n="246">In defence of their rights , now that underlings drew</l>
     <l n="247">That applause and renown which had long been their due .</l>
     <l n="248">Then the Oak raised his head , rather hoary with age ,</l>
     <l n="249">And shook his broad arms in the air in a rage ,</l>
     <l n="250">And exhorted them all with a feeling of pride ,</l>
     <l n="251">To maintain their ground firmly , whate'er might betide .</l>
     <l n="252">The Giant Elm follow 'd and proudly look 'd down</l>
     <l n="253">On the pitiful plots of their foes with a frown .</l>
     <l n="254">The Ash , pale with anger , derided “ the crew , ”</l>
     <l n="255">And the smooth-temper 'd Purple Beech look 'd rather blue .</l>
     <l n="256">The Chesnut grew heated , and roasted them well ;</l>
     <l n="257">And bitter the taunts of the Almond-tree fell .</l>
     <l n="258">The Apple and Pear both maintain 'd , in their spleen ,</l>
     <l n="259">That the fruit of their folly would shortly be seen .</l>
     <l n="260">The Laburnum , the Lime , and the Beech seem 'd afraid ,</l>
     <l n="261">But the Hawthorn was pointed in all that she said ,</l>
     <l n="262">And the threats of the Elder were heard to abound —</l>
     <l n="263">Like pellets from popguns they rattled around .</l>
     <l n="264">Discontented and moody the Drooping Larch lower 'd ,</l>
     <l n="265">The Crab knit his brows , for his temper was sour 'd ;</l>
     <l n="266">While the Birch-tree declared that the ill-fated elves ,</l>
     <l n="267">Their opponents , were making a rod for themselves .</l>
     <l n="268">With wrath and vexation the Maple ran o'er ;</l>
     <l n="269">The Aspen-tree trembled , the Willow wept sore ;</l>
     <l n="270">The Tulip-tree blush 'd , and the Sumach-tree sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="271">And the Dyer 's Oak thought it a stain on their pride .</l>
     <l n="272">The Fir stood erect , for he seem 'd to opine</l>
     <l n="273">That their sun for a very brief season would shine ;</l>
     <l n="274">While the well-meaning Walnut , foreboding their fall ,</l>
     <l n="275">Crack 'd a joke , for he cared not a fig for them all .</l>
     <l n="276">The Poplar drew up with a feeling of scorn ,</l>
     <l n="277">And the Cypress looked sad , and the Yew was forlorn .</l>
     <l n="278">The Plane smoothly spoke , and the Hazel the same ,</l>
     <l n="279">But the Scarlet Oak redden 'd with anger and shame .</l>
     <l n="280">At last they resolved , to blot out the disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="281">To stand fast by each other adorning the place ;</l>
     <l n="282">No longer their loss of applause to bemoan ,</l>
     <l n="283">But to come out next spring with a Fair of their own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="284">While the war-whoop was raised by the Birds and the Trees ,</l>
     <l n="285">The Beasts were impatient to blow up a breeze .</l>
     <l n="286">The Lion began with a royal bewail ,</l>
     <l n="287">And furiously lash 'd both his sides with his tail .</l>
     <l n="288">As he stalk 'd through his den , his wild eyes glared around ,</l>
     <l n="289">And his roar seem 'd to come from far under the ground .</l>
     <l n="290">His anger , disdain , and despair wanted scope ,</l>
     <l n="291">So he wish 'd himself back at the Cape of Good Hope .</l>
     <l n="292">The Tiger extended , in uttering a roar ,</l>
     <l n="293">A mouth that you might have mistook for the door ;</l>
     <l n="294">But in such a dilemma , I warn you , beware</l>
     <l n="295">How you enter in haste such a dark thoroughfare ;</l>
     <l n="296">For all who have pass 'd through the passage they say ,</l>
     <l n="297">Have terribly painted their coats by the way .</l>
     <l n="298">Poor Bruin declared it was unbearable quite ,</l>
     <l n="299">And was in a brown study till day turn 'd to night ;</l>
     <l n="300">The Axis turn 'd round in his rage , and just then</l>
     <l n="301">The Sloth look 'd as black as the ink in my pen .</l>
     <l n="302">The soft , silky , self-colour 'd Puma felt pain ,</l>
     <l n="303">Pale as ashes with anger he could not restrain ;</l>
     <l n="304">The Llama indignantly felt the disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="305">And spirted saliva in every one 's face ;</l>
     <l n="306">In fury the Mastiff bark 'd loud for relief ;</l>
     <l n="307">The poor patient Camel was laden with grief ;</l>
     <l n="308">The Antelope wisely eloped from the fray ,</l>
     <l n="309">But the Springbok was booked for the rest of the day .</l>
     <l n="310">The wrath of the Leopard then rose on the gale ,</l>
     <l n="311">And broke out in dark spots from his head to his tail ;</l>
     <l n="312">The Civet Cat mew 'd , and did nothing but fret ,</l>
     <l n="313">And the stripes of the Zebra were blacker than jet ;</l>
     <l n="314">The Opossum was posed , and looked wondrously sage ,</l>
     <l n="315">And the Red Coati Mondi turned sallow with rage ;</l>
     <l n="316">The Hyæna declared in a quarrelsome mood ,</l>
     <l n="317">He would instantly break through his den — if he could :</l>
     <l n="318">And the Moose Deer in ire would have bit his lip through ,</l>
     <l n="319">But he found it already divided in two .</l>
     <l n="320">The Schoolmaster Porcupine rang , too , the chimes ,—</l>
     <l n="321">He declar 'd that he 'd send an address to “ the Times ; ”</l>
     <l n="322">Nay , write all his quills to their stumps , ere he 'd stand</l>
     <l n="323">As a laughing-stock thus to the rest of the land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="324">When the Fair was concluded , and all the gay throng</l>
     <l n="325">Had abandon 'd the feast and the dance and the song ,</l>
     <l n="326">In quest of a calmer enjoyment to roam ,</l>
     <l n="327">For “ Home , ” after every enjoyment , “ is Home ! ”</l>
     <l n="328">The Trees toss 'd their heads ‘ tween the earth and the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="329">And the Birds and the Beasts were at sixes and sevens .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="330">But amid the confusion , the hubbub , and din ,</l>
     <l n="331">All remember 'd the proverb , “ They laugh most who win ! ”</l>
     <l n="332">This was certainly true at the famed Fancy Fair ;</l>
     <l n="333">Mr. Cross<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>was , they say , the most pleasant man there .</l>
     <l n="334">Let us hope , then , his genius was happily led</l>
     <l n="335">To allay the rude storm that hung over his head ;—</l>
     <l n="336">That the future his spirited plans will repay</l>
     <l n="337">Through many a gladsome and prosperous day ;</l>
     <l n="338">Make true the old saw , “ All is well that well ends , ”</l>
