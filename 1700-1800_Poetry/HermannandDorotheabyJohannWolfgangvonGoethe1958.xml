   <head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</head>
   <p>There are few modern poems of any country so perfect in their kind as the “ Hermann and Dorothea ” of Goethe . In clearness of characterization , in unity of tone , in the adjustment of background and foreground , in the conduct of the narrative , it conforms admirably to the strict canons of art ; yet it preserves a freshness and spontaneity in its emotional appeal that are rare in works of so classical a perfection in form .</p>
   <p>The basis of the poem is a historical incident . In the year 1731 the Archbishop of Salzburg drove out of his diocese a thousand Protestants , who took refuge in South Germany , and among whom was a girl who became the bride of the son of a rich burgher . The occasion of the girl 's exile was changed by Goethe to more recent times , and in the poem she is represented as a German from the west bank of the Rhine fleeing from the turmoil caused by the French Revolution . The political element is not a mere background , but is woven into the plot with consummate skill , being used , at one point , for example , in the characterization of Dorothea , who before the time of her appearance in the poem has been deprived of her first betrothed by the guillotine ; and , at another , in furnishing a telling contrast between the revolutionary uproar in France and the settled peace of the German village .</p>
   <p>The characters of the father and the minister Goethe took over from the original incident , the mother he invented , and the apothecary he made to stand for a group of friends . But all of these persons , as well as the two lovers , are recreated , and this so skillfully that while they are made notably familiar to us as individuals , they are no less significant as permanent types of human nature . The hexameter measure which he employed , and which is retained in the present translation , he handled with such charm that it has since seemed the natural verse for the domestic idyl — witness the obvious imitation of this , as of other features of the poem , in Longfellow 's “ Evangeline . ”</p>
   <p>Taken as a whole , with its beauty of form , its sentiment , tender yet restrained , and the compelling pathos of its story , “ Hermann and Dorothea ” appeals to a wider public than perhaps any other product of its author .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Truly , I never have seen the market and street so deserted !</l>
     <l n="2">How as if it were swept looks the town , or had perished ! Not fifty</l>
     <l n="3">Are there , methinks , of all our inhabitants in it remaining ,</l>
     <l n="4">What will not curiosity do ! here is every one running ,</l>
     <l n="5">Hurrying to gaze on the sad procession of pitiful exiles .</l>
     <l n="6">Fully a league it must be to the causeway they have to pass over ,</l>
     <l n="7">Yet all are hurrying down in the dusty heat of the noonday .</l>
     <l n="8">I , in good sooth , would not stir from my place to witness the sorrows</l>
     <l n="9">Borne by good , fugitive people , who now , with their rescued possessions ,</l>
     <l n="10">Driven , alas ! from beyond the Rhine , their beautiful country ,</l>
     <l n="11">Over to us are coming , and through the prosperous corner</l>
     <l n="12">Roam of this our luxuriant valley , and traverse its windings .</l>
     <l n="13">Well hast thou done , good wife , our son in thus kindly dispatching ,</l>
     <l n="14">Laden with something to eat and to drink , and with store of old linen ,</l>
     <l n="15">‘ Mongst the poor folk to distribute ; for giving belongs to the wealthy .</l>
     <l n="16">How the youth drives , to be sure ! What control he has over the horses !</l>
     <l n="17">Makes not our carriage a handsome appearance ,— the new one ? With comfort ,</l>
     <l n="18">Four could be seated within , with a place on the box for the coachman .</l>
     <l n="19">This time , he drove by himself . How lightly it rolled round the corner ! ”</l>
     <l n="20">Thus , as he sat at his ease in the porch of his house on the market ,</l>
     <l n="21">Unto his wife was speaking mine host of the Golden Lion .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="22">Thereupon answered and said the prudent , intelligent housewife :</l>
     <l n="23">“ Father , I am not inclined to be giving away my old linen :</l>
     <l n="24">Since it serves many a purpose ; and cannot be purchased for money ,</l>
     <l n="25">When we may want it . To-day , however , I gave , and with pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="26">Many a piece that was better , indeed , in shirts and in bed-clothes ;</l>
     <l n="27">For I was told of the aged and children who had to go naked .</l>
     <l n="28">But wilt thou pardon me , father ? thy wardrobe has also been plundered .</l>
     <l n="29">And , in especial , the wrapper that has the East-Indian flowers ,</l>
     <l n="30">Made of the finest of chintz , and lined with delicate flannel ,</l>
     <l n="31">Gave I away : it was thin and old , and quite out of the fashion . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="32">Thereupon answered and said , with a smile , the excellent landlord :</l>
     <l n="33">“ Faith ! I am sorry to lose it , my good old calico wrapper ,</l>
     <l n="34">Real East-Indian stuff : I never shall get such another .</l>
     <l n="35">Well , I had given up wearing it : nowadays , custom compels us</l>
     <l n="36">Always to go in surtout , and never appear but in jacket ;</l>
     <l n="37">Always to have on our boots ; forbidden are night-cap and slippers . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="38">“ See ! ” interrupted the wife ; “ even now some are yonder returning ,</l>
     <l n="39">Who have beheld the procession : it must , then , already be over .</l>
     <l n="40">Look at the dust on their shoes ! and see how their faces are glowing !</l>
     <l n="41">Every one carries his kerchief , and with it is wiping the sweat off .</l>
     <l n="42">Not for a sight like that would I run so far and so suffer ,</l>
     <l n="43">Through such a heat ; in sooth , enough shall I have in the telling . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="44">Thereupon answered and said , with emphasis , thus , the good father :</l>
     <l n="45">“ Rarely does weather like this attend such a harvest as this is .</l>
     <l n="46">We shall be bringing our grain in dry , as the hay was before it .</l>
     <l n="47">Not the least cloud to be seen , so perfectly clear is the heaven ;</l>
     <l n="48">And , with delicious coolness , the wind blows in from the eastward .</l>
     <l n="49">That is the weather to last ! over-ripe are the cornfields already ;</l>
     <l n="50">We shall begin on the morrow to gather our copious harvest . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">Constantly , while he thus spoke , the crowds of men and of women</l>
     <l n="52">Grew , who their homeward way were over the market-place wending ;</l>
     <l n="53">And , with the rest , there also returned , his daughters beside him ,</l>
     <l n="54">Back to his modernized house on the opposite side of the market ,</l>
     <l n="55">Foremost merchant of all the town , their opulent neighbor ,</l>
     <l n="56">Rapidly driving his open barouche ,— it was builded in Landau .</l>
     <l n="57">Lively now grew the streets , for the city was handsomely peopled .</l>
     <l n="58">Many a trade was therein carried on , and large manufactures .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="59">Under their doorway thus the affectionate couple were sitting ,</l>
     <l n="60">Pleasing themselves with many remarks on the wandering people .</l>
     <l n="61">Finally broke in , however , the worthy housewife , exclaiming :</l>
     <l n="62">“ Yonder our pastor , see ! is hitherward coming , and with him</l>
     <l n="63">Comes our neighbor the doctor , so they shall every thing tell us ;</l>
     <l n="64">All they have witnessed abroad , and which ‘ tis a sorrow to look on . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">Cordially then the two men drew nigh , and saluted the couple ;</l>
     <l n="66">Sat themselves down on the benches of wood that were placed in the doorway ,</l>
     <l n="67">Shaking the dust from their feet , and fanning themselves with their kerchiefs .</l>
     <l n="68">Then was the doctor , as soon as exchanged were the mutual greetings ,</l>
     <l n="69">First to begin , and said , almost in a tone of vexation :</l>
     <l n="70">“ Such is mankind , forsooth ! and one man is just like another ,</l>
     <l n="71">Liking to gape and to stare when ill-luck has befallen his neighbor .</l>
     <l n="72">Every one hurries to look at the flames , as they soar in destruction ;</l>
     <l n="73">Runs to behold the poor culprit , to execution conducted :</l>
     <l n="74">Now all are sallying forth to gaze on the need of these exiles ,</l>
     <l n="75">Nor is there one who considers that he , by a similar fortune ,</l>
     <l n="76">May , in the future , if not indeed next , be likewise o'ertaken .</l>
     <l n="77">Levity not to be pardoned , I deem ; yet it lies in man 's nature . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="78">Thereupon answered and said the noble , intelligent pastor ;</l>
     <l n="79">Ornament he of the town , still young , in the prime of his manhood .</l>
     <l n="80">He was acquainted with life ,— with the needs of his hearers acquainted ;</l>
     <l n="81">Deeply imbued he was with the Holy Scriptures ’ importance ,</l>
     <l n="82">As they reveal man 's destiny to us , and man 's disposition ;</l>
     <l n="83">Thoroughly versed , besides , in best of secular writings .</l>
     <l n="84">“ I should be loath , ” he replied , “ to censure an innocent instinct ,</l>
     <l n="85">Which to mankind by good mother Nature has always been given .</l>
     <l n="86">What understanding and reason may sometimes fail to accomplish ,</l>
     <l n="87">Oft will such fortunate impulse , that bears us resistlessly with it .</l>
     <l n="88">Did curiosity draw not man with its potent attraction ,</l>
     <l n="89">Say , would he ever have learned how harmoniously fitted together</l>
     <l n="90">Worldly experiences are ? For first what is novel he covets ;</l>
     <l n="91">Then with unwearying industry follows he after the useful ;</l>
     <l n="92">Finally longs for the good by which he is raised and ennobled .</l>
     <l n="93">While he is young , such lightness of mind is a joyous companion ,</l>
     <l n="94">Traces of pain-giving evil effacing as soon as ‘ tis over .</l>
     <l n="95">He is indeed to be praised , who , out of this gladness of temper ,</l>
     <l n="96">Has in his ripening years a sound understanding developed ;</l>
     <l n="97">Who , in good fortune or ill , with zeal and activity labors :</l>
     <l n="98">Such an one bringeth to pass what is good , and repaireth the evil . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="99">Then broke familiarly in the housewife impatient , exclaiming :</l>
     <l n="100">“ Tell us of what ye have seen ; for that I am longing to hear of ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="101">“ Hardly , ” with emphasis then the village doctor made answer ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ Can I find spirits so soon after all the scenes I have witnessed .</l>
     <l n="103">Oh , the manifold miseries ! who shall be able to tell them ?</l>
     <l n="104">E'en before crossing the meadows , and while we were yet at a distance ,</l>
     <l n="105">Saw we the dust ; but still from hill to hill the procession</l>
     <l n="106">Passed away out of our sight , and we could distinguish but little ,</l>
     <l n="107">But when at last we were come to the street that crosses the valley ,</l>
     <l n="108">Great was the crowd and confusion of persons on foot and of wagons .</l>
     <l n="109">There , alas ! saw we enough of these poor unfortunates passing ,</l>
     <l n="110">And could from some of them learn how bitter the sorrowful flight was ,</l>
     <l n="111">Yet how joyful the feeling of life thus hastily rescued .</l>
     <l n="112">Mournful it was to behold the most miscellaneous chattels ,—</l>
     <l n="113">All those things which are housed in every well-furnished dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="114">All by the house-keeper 's care set up in their suitable places ,</l>
     <l n="115">Always ready for use ; for useful is each and important .—</l>
     <l n="116">Now these things to behold , piled up on all manner of wagons ,</l>
     <l n="117">One on the top of another , as hurriedly they had been rescued .</l>
     <l n="118">Over the chest of drawers were the sieve and wool coverlet lying ;</l>
     <l n="119">Thrown in the kneading-trough lay the bed , and the sheets on the mirror .</l>
     <l n="120">Danger , alas ! as we learned ourselves in our great conflagration</l>
     <l n="121">Twenty years since , will take from a man all power of reflection ,</l>
     <l n="122">So that he grasps things worthless and leaves what is precious behind him .</l>
     <l n="123">Here , too , with unconsidering care they were carrying with them</l>
     <l n="124">Pitiful trash , that only encumbered the horses and oxen ;</l>
     <l n="125">Such as old barrels and boards , the pen for the goose , and the bird-cage .</l>
     <l n="126">Women and children , too , went toiling along with their bundles ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="127">“ Panting ‘ neath baskets and tubs , full of things of no manner of value :</l>
     <l n="128">So unwilling is man to relinquish his meanest possession .</l>
     <l n="129">Thus on the dusty road the crowded procession moved forward ,</l>
     <l n="130">All confused and disordered . The one whose beasts were the weaker ,</l>
     <l n="131">Wanted more slowly to drive , while faster would hurry another .</l>
     <l n="132">Presently went up a scream from the closely squeezed women and children ,</l>
     <l n="133">And with the yelping of dogs was mingled the lowing of cattle ,</l>
     <l n="134">Cries of distress from the aged and sick , who aloft on the wagon ,</l>
     <l n="135">Heavy and thus overpacked , upon beds were sitting and swaying .</l>
     <l n="136">Pressed at last from the rut and out to the edge of the highway ,</l>
     <l n="137">Slipped the creaking wheel ; the cart lost its balance , and over</l>
     <l n="138">Fell in the ditch . In the swing the people were flung to a distance ,</l>
     <l n="139">Far off into the field , with horrible screams ; by good fortune</l>
     <l n="140">Later the boxes were thrown and fell more near to the wagon .</l>
     <l n="141">Verily all who had witnessed the fall , expected to see them</l>
     <l n="142">Crushed into pieces beneath the weight of trunks and of presses .</l>
     <l n="143">So lay the cart all broken to fragments , and helpless the people .</l>
     <l n="144">Keeping their onward way , the others drove hastily by them ,</l>
     <l n="145">Each thinking only of self , and carried away by the current .</l>
     <l n="146">Then we ran to the spot , and found the sick and the aged ,—</l>
     <l n="147">Those who at home and in bed could before their lingering ailments</l>
     <l n="148">Scarcely endure ,— lying bruised on the ground , complaining and groaning ,</l>
     <l n="149">Choked by the billowing dust , and scorched by the heat of the noonday . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="150">Thereupon answered and said the kind-hearted landlord , with feeling :</l>
     <l n="151">“ Would that our Hermann might meet them and give them refreshment and clothing !</l>
     <l n="152">Loath should I be to behold them : the looking on suffering pains me .</l>
     <l n="153">Touched by the earliest tidings of their so cruel afflictions ,</l>
     <l n="154">Hastily sent we a mite from out of our super-abundance ,</l>
     <l n="155">Only that some might be strengthened , and we might ourselves be made easy .</l>
     <l n="156">But let us now no longer renew these sorrowful pictures</l>
     <l n="157">Knowing how readily fear steals into the heart of us mortals ,</l>
     <l n="158">And anxiety , worse to me than the actual evil .</l>
     <l n="159">Come with me into the room behind , our cool little parlor ,</l>
     <l n="160">Where no sunbeam e'er shines , and no sultry breath ever enters</l>
     <l n="161">Through its thickness of wall . There mother will bring us a flagon</l>
     <l n="162">Of our old eighty-three , with which we may banish our fancies .</l>
     <l n="163">Here ‘ tis not cosey to drink : the flies so buzz round the glasses . ”</l>
     <l n="164">Thither adjourned they then , and all rejoiced in the coolness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="165">Carefully brought forth the mother the clear and glorious vintage ,</l>
     <l n="166">Cased in a well-polished flask , on a waiter of glittering pewter ,</l>
     <l n="167">Set round with large green glasses , the drinking cups meet for the Rhine Wine .</l>
     <l n="168">So sat the three together about the highly waxed table ,</l>
     <l n="169">Gleaming and round and brown , that on mighty feet was supported ,</l>
     <l n="170">Joyously rang at once the glasses of landlord and pastor ,</l>
     <l n="171">But his motionless held the third , and sat lost in reflection ,</l>
     <l n="172">Until with words of good-humor the landlord challenged him , saying ,—</l>
     <l n="173">“ Come , sir neighbor , empty your glass , for God in his mercy</l>
     <l n="174">Thus far has kept us from evil , and so in the future will keep us .</l>
     <l n="175">For who acknowledges not , that since our dread conflagration ,</l>
     <l n="176">When he so hardly chastised us , he now is continually blessing ,</l>
     <l n="177">Constantly shielding , as man the apple of his eye watches over ,</l>
     <l n="178">Holding it precious and dear above all the rest of his members ?</l>
     <l n="179">Shall he in time to come not defend us and furnish us succor ?</l>
     <l n="180">Only when danger is nigh do we see how great is his power .</l>
     <l n="181">Shall he this blooming town which he once by industrious burghers</l>
     <l n="182">Built up afresh from its ashes , and afterwards blessed with abundance ,</l>
     <l n="183">Now demolish again , and bring all the labor to nothing ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="184">Cheerfully said in reply the excellent pastor , and kindly :</l>
     <l n="185">“ Keep thyself firm in the faith , and firm abide in this temper ;</l>
     <l n="186">For it makes steadfast and wise when fortune is fair , and when evil ,</l>
     <l n="187">Furnishes sweet consolation and animates hopes the sublimest . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="188">Then made answer the landlord , with thoughts judicious and manly :</l>
     <l n="189">“ Often the Rhine 's broad stream have I with astonishment greeted ,</l>
     <l n="190">As I have neared it again , after travelling abroad upon business .</l>
     <l n="191">Always majestic it seemed , and my mind and spirit exalted .</l>
     <l n="192">But I could never imagine its beautiful banks would so shortly</l>
     <l n="193">Be to a rampart transformed , to keep from our borders the Frenchman ,</l>
     <l n="194">And its wide-spreading bed be a moat all passage to hinder .</l>
     <l n="195">See ! thus nature protects , the stout-hearted Germans protect us ,</l>
     <l n="196">And thus protects us the Lord , who then will he weakly despondent ?</l>
     <l n="197">Weary already the combatants , all indications are peaceful .</l>
     <l n="198">Would it might be that when that festival , ardently longed for ,</l>
     <l n="199">Shall in our church be observed , when the sacred Te Deum is rising ,</l>
     <l n="200">Swelled by the pealing of organ and bells , and the blaring of trumpets ,—</l>
     <l n="201">Would it might be that that day should behold my Hermann , sir pastor ,</l>
     <l n="202">Standing , his choice now made , with his bride before thee at the altar ,</l>
     <l n="203">Making that festal day , that through every land shall be honored ,</l>
     <l n="204">My anniversary , too , henceforth of domestic rejoicing !</l>
     <l n="205">But I observe with regret , that the youth so efficient and active</l>
     <l n="206">Ever in household affairs , when abroad is timid and backward .</l>
     <l n="207">Little enjoyment he finds in going about among others ;</l>
     <l n="208">Nay , he will even avoid young ladies ’ society wholly ;</l>
     <l n="209">Shuns the enlivening dance which all young persons delight in . ”</l>

     <l n="210">Thus he spoke and listened ; for now was heard in the distance</l>
     <l n="211">Clattering of horses ’ hoofs drawing near , and the roll of the wagon ,</l>
     <l n="212">Which , with furious haste , came thundering under the gateway .</l>

     <l n="1">Now when of comely mien the son came into the chamber ,</l>
     <l n="2">Turned with a searching look the eyes of the preacher upon him ,</l>
     <l n="3">And , with the gaze of the student , who easily fathoms expression ,</l>
     <l n="4">Scrutinized well his face and form and his general bearing .</l>
     <l n="5">Then with a smile he spoke , and said in words of affection :</l>
     <l n="6">“ Truly a different being thou comest ! I never have seen thee</l>
     <l n="7">Cheerful as now , nor ever beheld I thy glances so beaming .</l>
     <l n="8">Joyous thou comest , and happy : ‘ tis plain that among the poor people</l>
     <l n="9">Thou hast been sharing thy gifts , and receiving their blessings upon thee . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">Quietly then , and with serious words , the son made him answer :</l>
     <l n="11">“ If I have acted as ye will commend , I know not ; but I followed</l>
     <l n="12">That which my heart bade me do , as I shall exactly relate you .</l>
     <l n="13">Thou wert , mother , so long in rummaging ‘ mong thy old pieces ,</l>
     <l n="14">Picking and choosing , that not until late was thy bundle together ;</l>
     <l n="15">Then too the wine and the beer took care and time in the packing .</l>
     <l n="16">When I came forth through the gateway at last , and out on the high-road ,</l>
     <l n="17">Backward the crowd of citizens streamed with women and children ,</l>
     <l n="18">Coming to meet me ; for far was already the band of the exiles .</l>
     <l n="19">Quicker I kept on my way , and drove with speed to the village ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where they were meaning to rest , as I heard , and tarry till morning .</l>
     <l n="21">Thitherward up the new street as I hasted , a stout-timbered wagon ,</l>
     <l n="22">Drawn by two oxen , I saw , of that region the largest and strongest ;</l>
     <l n="23">While , with vigorous steps , a maiden was walking beside them ,</l>
     <l n="24">And , a long staff in her hand , the two powerful creatures was guiding ,</l>
     <l n="25">Urging them now , now holding them back ; with skill did she drive them .</l>
     <l n="26">Soon as the maiden perceived me , she calmly drew near to the horses ,</l>
     <l n="27">And in these words she addressed me : ‘ Not thus deplorable always</l>
     <l n="28">Has our condition been , as to-day on this journey thou seest .</l>
     <l n="29">I am not yet grown used to asking gifts of a stranger ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which he will often unwillingly give , to be rid of the beggar .</l>
     <l n="31">But necessity drives me to speak ; for here , on the straw , lies</l>
     <l n="32">Newly delivered of child , a rich land-owner 's wife , whom I scarcely</l>
     <l n="33">Have in her pregnancy , safe brought off with the oxen and wagon .</l>
     <l n="34">Naked , now in her arms the new-born infant is lying ,</l>
     <l n="35">And but little the help our friends will be able to furnish ,</l>
     <l n="36">If in the neighboring village , indeed , where to-day we would rest us ,</l>
     <l n="37">Still we shall find them ; though much do I fear they already have passed it .</l>
     <l n="38">Shouldst thou have linen to spare of any description , provided</l>
     <l n="39">Thou of this neighborhood art , to the poor in charity give it . ’</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="40">“ Thus she spoke , and the pale-faced mother raised herself feebly</l>
     <l n="41">Up from the straw , and towards me looked . Then said I in answer :</l>
     <l n="42">‘ Surely unto the good , a spirit from heaven oft speaketh ,</l>
     <l n="43">Making them feel the distress that threatens a suffering brother .</l>
     <l n="44">For thou must know that my mother , already presaging thy sorrows ,</l>
     <l n="45">Gave me a bundle to use it straightway for the need of the naked , ’</l>
     <l n="46">Then I untied the knots of the string , and the wrapper of father 's</l>
     <l n="47">Unto her gave , and gave her as well the shirts and the linen .</l>
     <l n="48">And she thanked me with joy , and cried : ‘ The happy believe not</l>
     <l n="49">Miracles yet can be wrought : for only in need we acknowledge</l>
     <l n="50">God 's own hand and finger , that leads the good to show goodness ,</l>
     <l n="51">What unto us he has done through thee , may he do to thee also !</l>
     <l n="52">And I beheld with what pleasure the sick woman handled the linens ,</l>
     <l n="53">But with especial delight the dressing-gown 's delicate flannel .</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Let us make haste , ’ the maid to her said , ‘ and come to the village ,</l>
     <l n="55">Where our people will halt for the night and already are resting .</l>
     <l n="56">There these clothes for the children I , one and all , straightway will portion . ’</l>
     <l n="57">Then she saluted again , her thanks most warmly expressing ,</l>
     <l n="58">Started the oxen ; the wagon went on ; but there I still lingered ,</l>
     <l n="59">Still held the horses in check ; for now my heart was divided</l>
     <l n="60">Whether to drive with speed to the village , and there the provisions</l>
     <l n="61">Share ‘ mong the rest of the people , or whether I here to the maiden</l>
     <l n="62">All should deliver at once , for her discreetly to portion .</l>
     <l n="63">And in an instant my heart had decided , and quietly driving</l>
     <l n="64">After the maiden , I soon overtook her , and said to her quickly :</l>
     <l n="65">‘ Hearken , good maiden ;— my mother packed up not linen-stuffs only</l>
     <l n="66">Into the carriage , that I should have clothes to furnish the naked ;</l>
     <l n="67">Wine and beer she added besides , and supply of provisions :</l>
     <l n="68">Plenty of all these things I have in the box of the carriage .</l>
     <l n="69">But now I feel myself moved to deliver these offerings also</l>
     <l n="70">Into thy hand ; for so shall I best fulfil my commission .</l>
     <l n="71">Thou wilt divide them with judgment , while I must by chance be directed . ’</l>
     <l n="72">Thereupon answered the maiden : ‘ I will with faithfulness portion</l>
     <l n="73">These thy gifts , that all shall bring comfort to those who are needy . ’</l>
     <l n="74">Thus she spoke , and quickly the box of the carriage I opened ,</l>
     <l n="75">Brought forth thence the substantial hams , and brought out the breadstuffs ,</l>
     <l n="76">Bottles of wine and beer , and one and all gave to the maiden .</l>
     <l n="77">Willingly would I have given her more , but the carriage was empty .</l>
     <l n="78">All she packed at the sick woman 's feet , and went on her journey .</l>
     <l n="79">I , with my horses and carriage , drove rapidly back to the city . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="80">Instantly now , when Hermann had ceased , the talkative neighbor</l>
     <l n="81">Took up the word , and cried : “ Oh happy , in days like the present ,</l>
     <l n="82">Days of flight and confusion , who lives by himself in his dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="83">Having no wife nor child to be clinging about him in terror !</l>
     <l n="84">Happy I feel myself now , and would not for much be called father ;</l>
     <l n="85">Would not have wife and children to-day , for whom to be anxious .</l>
     <l n="86">Oft have I thought of this flight before ; and have packed up together</l>
     <l n="87">All my best things already , the chains and old pieces of money</l>
     <l n="88">That were my sainted mother 's , of which not one has been sold yet .</l>
     <l n="89">Much would be left behind , it is true , not easily gotten .</l>
     <l n="90">Even the roots and the herbs , that were with such industry gathered ,</l>
     <l n="91">I should be sorry to lose , though the worth of the goods is but trifling .</l>
     <l n="92">If my purveyor remained , I could go from my dwelling contented .</l>
     <l n="93">When my cash I have brought away safe , and have rescued my person ,</l>
     <l n="94">All is safe : none find it so easy to fly as the single . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="95">“ Neighbor , ” unto his words young Hermann with emphasis answered :</l>
     <l n="96">“ I can in no wise agree with thee here , and censure thy language .</l>
     <l n="97">Is he indeed a man to be prized , who , in good and in evil ,</l>
     <l n="98">Takes no thought but for self , and gladness and sorrow with others</l>
     <l n="99">Knows not how to divide , nor feels his heart so impel him ?</l>
     <l n="100">Rather than ever to-day would I make up my mind to be married :</l>
     <l n="101">Many a worthy maiden is needing a husband 's protection ,</l>
     <l n="102">And the man needs an inspiriting wife when ill is impending . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="103">Thereupon smiling the father replied : “ Thus love I to hear thee !</l>
     <l n="104">That is a sensible word such as rarely I 've known thee to utter . ”</l>
     <l n="105">Straightway , however , the mother broke in with quickness , exclaiming :</l>
     <l n="106">“ Son , to be sure , thou art right ! we parents have set the example ;</l>
     <l n="107">Seeing that not in our season of joy did we choose one another ;</l>
     <l n="108">Rather the saddest of hours it was that bound us together .</l>
     <l n="109">Monday morning — I mind it well ; for the day that preceded</l>
     <l n="110">Came that terrible fire by which our city was ravaged —</l>
     <l n="111">Twenty years will have gone . The day was a Sunday as this is ;</l>
     <l n="112">Hot and dry was the season ; the water was almost exhausted .</l>
     <l n="113">All the people were strolling abroad in their holiday dresses ,</l>
     <l n="114">‘ Mong the villages partly , and part in the mills and the taverns .</l>
     <l n="115">And at the end of the city the flames began , and went coursing</l>
     <l n="116">Quickly along the streets , creating a draught in their passage .</l>
     <l n="117">Burned were the barns where the copious harvest already was garnered ;</l>
     <l n="118">Burned were the streets as far as the market ; the house of my father ,</l>
     <l n="119">Neighbor to this , was destroyed , and this one also fell with it .</l>
     <l n="120">Little we managed to save . I sat , that sorrowful night through ,</l>
     <l n="121">Outside the town on the common , to guard the beds and the boxes .</l>
     <l n="122">Sleep overtook me at last , and when I again was awakened ,</l>
     <l n="123">Feeling the chill of the morning that always descends before sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="124">There were the smoke and the glare , and the walls and chimneys in ruins .</l>
     <l n="125">Then fell a weight on my heart ; but more majestic than ever</l>
     <l n="126">Came up the sun again , inspiring my bosom with courage .</l>
     <l n="127">Then I rose hastily up , with a yearning the place to revisit</l>
     <l n="128">Whereon our dwelling had stood , and to see if the hens had been rescued ,</l>
     <l n="129">Which I especially loved , for I still was a child in my feelings .</l>
     <l n="130">Thus as I over the still-smoking timbers of house and of court-yard</l>
     <l n="131">Picked my way , and beheld the dwelling so ruined and wasted ,</l>
     <l n="132">Thou camest up to examine the place , from the other direction .</l>
     <l n="133">Under the ruins thy horse in his stall had been buried ; the rubbish</l>
     <l n="134">Lay on the spot and the glimmering beams ; of the horse we saw nothing .</l>
     <l n="135">Thoughtful and grieving we stood there thus , each facing the other ,</l>
     <l n="136">Now that the wall was fallen that once had divided our court-yards .</l>
     <l n="137">Thereupon thou by the hand didst take me , and speak to me , saying ,—</l>
     <l n="138">‘ Lisa , how earnest thou hither ? Go back ! thy soles must be burning ;</l>
     <l n="139">Hot the rubbish is here : it scorches my boots , which are stronger . ’</l>
     <l n="140">And thou didst lift me up , and carry me out through thy court-yard .</l>
     <l n="141">There was the door of the house left standing yet with its archway ,</l>
     <l n="142">Just as ‘ tis standing now , the one thing only remaining .</l>
     <l n="143">Then thou didst set me down and kiss me ; to that I objected ;</l>
     <l n="144">But thou didst answer and say with kindly significant language :</l>
     <l n="145">‘ See ! my house lies in ruins : remain here and help me rebuild it ;</l>
     <l n="146">So shall my help in return be given to building thy father 's . ’</l>
     <l n="147">Yet did I not comprehend thee until thou sentest thy mother</l>
     <l n="148">Unto my father , and quick were the happy espousals accomplished .</l>
     <l n="149">E'en to this day I remember with joy those half-consumed timbers ,</l>
     <l n="150">And I can see once more the sun coming up in such splendor ;</l>
     <l n="151">For ‘ twas the day that gave me my husband ; and , ere the first season</l>
     <l n="152">Passed of that wild desolation , a son to my youth had been given .</l>
     <l n="153">Therefore I praise thee , Hermann , that thou , with an honest assurance ,</l>
     <l n="154">Shouldst , in these sorrowful days , be thinking thyself of a maiden ,</l>
     <l n="155">And amid ruins and war shouldst thus have the courage to woo her . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="156">Straightway , then , and with warmth , the father replied to her , saying :</l>
     <l n="157">“ Worthy of praise is the feeling , and truthful also the story ,</l>
     <l n="158">Mother , that thou hast related ; for so indeed everything happened .</l>
     <l n="159">Better , however , is better . It is not the business of all men</l>
     <l n="160">Thus their life and estate to begin from the very foundation :</l>
     <l n="161">Every one needs not to worry himself as we and the rest did .</l>
     <l n="162">Oh , how happy is he whose father and mother shall give him ,</l>
     <l n="163">Furnished and ready , a house which he can adorn with his increase .</l>
     <l n="164">Every beginning is hard ; but most the beginning a household .</l>
     <l n="165">Many are human wants , and every thing daily grows dearer ,</l>
     <l n="166">So that a man must consider the means of increasing his earnings .</l>
     <l n="167">This I hope therefore of thee , my Hermann , that into our dwelling</l>
     <l n="168">Thou wilt be bringing ere long a bride who is handsomely dowered ;</l>
     <l n="169">For it is meet that a gallant young man have an opulent maiden .</l>
     <l n="170">Great is the comfort of home whene'er , with the woman elected ,</l>
     <l n="171">Enter the useful presents , besides , in box and in basket .</l>
     <l n="172">Not for this many a year in vain has the mother been busy</l>
     <l n="173">Making her daughter 's linens of strong and delicate texture ;</l>
     <l n="174">God-parents have not in vain been giving their vessels of silver ,</l>
     <l n="175">And the father laid by in his desk the rare pieces of money ;</l>
     <l n="176">For there a day will come when she , with her gifts and possessions ,</l>
     <l n="177">Shall that youth rejoice who has chosen her out of all others .</l>
     <l n="178">Well do I know how good in a house is a woman 's position ,</l>
     <l n="179">Who her own furniture round her knows , in kitchen and chamber ;</l>
     <l n="180">Who herself the bed and herself the table has covered .</l>
     <l n="181">Only a well-dowered bride should I like to receive to my dwelling .</l>
     <l n="182">She who is poor is sure , in the end , to be scorned by her husband ;</l>
     <l n="183">And will as servant be held , who as servant came in with her bundle .</l>
     <l n="184">Men will remain unjust when the season of love is gone over .</l>
     <l n="185">Yes , my Hermann , thy father 's old age thou greatly canst gladden ,</l>
     <l n="186">If thou a daughter-in-law will speedily bring to my dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="187">Out of the neighborhood here ,— from the house over yonder , the green one .</l>
     <l n="188">Rich is the man , I can tell thee . His manufactures and traffic</l>
     <l n="189">Daily are making him richer ; for whence draws the merchant not profit ?</l>
     <l n="190">Three daughters only he has , to divide his fortune among them .</l>
     <l n="191">True that the eldest already is taken ; but there is the second</l>
     <l n="192">Still to be had , as well as the third ; and not long so , it may be .</l>
     <l n="193">I would never have lingered till now , had I been in thy place ;</l>
     <l n="194">But had fetched one of the maidens , as once I bore off thy dear mother . ”</l>
     <l n="195">Modestly then did the son to the urgent father answer ;</l>
     <l n="196">“ Truly ‘ twas my wish too , as well as thine own , to have chosen</l>
     <l n="197">One of our neighbor 's daughters , for we had been brought up together ;</l>
     <l n="198">Played , in the early days , about the market-place fountain ;</l>
     <l n="199">And , from the other boys ’ rudeness , I often have been their defender .</l>
     <l n="200">That , though , is long since past : the girls , as they grew to be older ,</l>
     <l n="201">Properly stayed in the house , and shunned the more boisterous pastimes .</l>
     <l n="202">Well brought up are they , surely ! I used sometimes to go over ,</l>
     <l n="203">Partly to gratify thee , and because of our former acquaintance :</l>
     <l n="204">But no pleasure I ever could take in being among them ;</l>
     <l n="205">For I was always obliged to endure their censures upon me .</l>
     <l n="206">Quite too long was my coat , the cloth too coarse , and the color</l>
     <l n="207">Quite too common ; my hair was not cropped , as it should be , and frizzled .</l>
     <l n="208">I was resolved , at last , that I , also , would dress myself finely ,</l>
     <l n="209">Just as those office-boys do who always are seen there on Sundays ,</l>
     <l n="210">Wearing in summer their half-silken flaps , that dangled about them ;</l>
     <l n="211">But I discovered , betimes , they made ever a laughing-stock of me .</l>
     <l n="212">And I was vexed when I saw it ,— it wounded my pride ; but more deeply</l>
     <l n="213">Felt I aggrieved that they the good-will should so far misinterpret</l>
     <l n="214">That in my heart I bore them ,— especially Minna the youngest .</l>
     <l n="215">It was on Easter-day that last I went over to see them ;</l>
     <l n="216">Wearing my best new coat , that is now hanging up in the closet ,</l>
     <l n="217">And having frizzled my hair , like that of the other young fellows .</l>
     <l n="218">Soon as I entered , they tittered ; but that not at me , as I fancied .</l>
     <l n="219">Minna before the piano was seated ; the father was present ,</l>
     <l n="220">Hearing his daughters sing , and full of delight and good-humor .</l>
     <l n="221">Much I could not understand of all that was said in the singing ;</l>
     <l n="222">But of Pamina I often heard , and oft of Tamino :</l>
     <l n="223">And I , besides , could not stay there dumb ; so , as soon as she ended ,</l>
     <l n="224">Something about the words I asked , and about the two persons .</l>
     <l n="225">Thereupon all were silent and smiled ; but the father made answer :</l>
     <l n="226">‘ Thou knowest no one , my friend , I believe , but Adam and Eve ? ’</l>
     <l n="227">No one restrained himself longer , but loud laughed out then the maidens ,</l>
     <l n="228">Loud laughed out the boys , the old man held his sides for his laughing .</l>
     <l n="229">I , in embarrassment , dropped my hat , and the giggling continued ,</l>
     <l n="230">On and on and on , for all they kept playing and singing .</l>
     <l n="231">Back to the house here I hurried , o'ercome with shame and vexation ,</l>
     <l n="232">Hung up my coat in the closet , and pulled out the curls with my fingers ,</l>
     <l n="233">Swearing that never again my foot should cross over that threshold .</l>
     <l n="234">And I was perfectly right ; for vain are the maidens , and heartless .</l>
     <l n="235">E'en to this day , as I hear , I am called by them ever ‘ Tamino . ’ ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="236">Thereupon answered the mother , and said : “ Thou shouldest not , Hermann ,</l>

     <l n="238">Minna , believe me , is good , and was always disposed to thee kindly .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thus did the modest son slip away from the angry upbraiding ;</l>
     <l n="2">But in the tone he had taken at first , the father continued :</l>
     <l n="3">“ That comes not out of a man which he has not in him ; and hardly</l>
     <l n="4">Shall the joy ever be mine of seeing my dearest wish granted :</l>
     <l n="5">That my son may not as his father be , but a better .</l>
     <l n="6">What would become of the house , and what of the city if each one</l>
     <l n="7">Were not with pleasure and always intent on maintaining , renewing ,</l>
     <l n="8">Yea , and improving , too , as time and the foreigner teach us !</l>
     <l n="9">Man is not meant , forsooth , to grow from the ground like a mushroom ,</l>
     <l n="10">Quickly to perish away on the spot of ground that begot him ,</l>
     <l n="11">Leaving no trace behind of himself and his animate action !</l>
     <l n="12">As by the house we straightway can tell the mind of the master ,</l>
     <l n="13">So , when we walk through a city , we judge of the persons who rule it .</l>
     <l n="14">For where the towers and walls are falling to ruin ; where offal</l>
     <l n="15">Lies in heaps in the gutters , and alleys with offal are littered ;</l>
     <l n="16">Where from its place has started the stone , and no one resets it ;</l>
     <l n="17">Where the timbers are rotting away , and the house is awaiting</l>
     <l n="18">Vainly its new supports ,— that place we may know is ill governed .</l>
     <l n="19">Since if not from above work order and cleanliness downward ,</l>
     <l n="20">Easily grows the citizen used to untidy postponement ;</l>
     <l n="21">Just as the beggar grows likewise used to his ragged apparel .</l>
     <l n="22">Therefore I wished that our Hermann might early set out on some travels ;</l>
     <l n="23">That he at least might behold the cities of Strasburg and Frankfort ,</l>
     <l n="24">Friendly Mannheim , too , that is cheerful and evenly builded .</l>
     <l n="25">He that has once beheld cities so cleanly and large , never after</l>
     <l n="26">Ceases his own native city , though small it may be , to embellish .</l>
     <l n="27">Do not the strangers who come here commend the repairs in our gateway ,</l>
     <l n="28">Notice our whitewashed tower , and the church we have newly rebuilded ?</l>
     <l n="29">Are not all praising our pavement ? the covered canals full of water ,</l>
     <l n="30">Laid with a wise distribution , which furnish us profit and safety ,</l>
     <l n="31">So that no sooner does fire break out than ‘ tis promptly arrested ?</l>
     <l n="32">Has not all this come to pass since the time of our great conflagration ?</l>
     <l n="33">Builder I six times was named by the council , and won the approval ,</l>
     <l n="34">Won moreover the heartfelt thanks of all the good burghers ,</l>
     <l n="35">Actively carrying out what I planned , and also fulfilling</l>
     <l n="36">What had by upright men been designed , and left uncompleted .</l>
     <l n="37">Finally grew the same zeal in every one of the council ;</l>
     <l n="38">All now labor together , and firmly decided already</l>
     <l n="39">Stands it to build the new causeway that shall with the highroad connect us .</l>
     <l n="40">But I am sorely afraid that will not be the way with our children .</l>
     <l n="41">Some think only of pleasure and perishable apparel ;</l>
     <l n="42">Others will cower at home , and behind the stove will sit brooding .</l>
     <l n="43">One of this kind , as I fear , we shall find to the last in our Hermann . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="44">Straightway answered and said the good and intelligent mother :</l>
     <l n="45">“ Why wilt thou always , father , be doing our son such injustice ?</l>
     <l n="46">That least of all is the way to bring thy wish to fulfilment .</l>
     <l n="47">We have no power to fashion our children as suiteth our fancy ;</l>
     <l n="48">As they are given by God , we so must have them and love them ;</l>
     <l n="49">Teach them as best we can , and let each of them follow his nature .</l>
     <l n="50">One will have talents of one sort , and different talents another .</l>
     <l n="51">Every one uses his own ; in his own individual fashion ,</l>
     <l n="52">Each must be happy and good . I will not have my Hermann found fault with ;</l>
     <l n="53">For he is worthy , I know , of the goods he shall one day inherit ;</l>
     <l n="54">Will be an excellent landlord , a pattern to burghers and builders ;</l>
     <l n="55">Neither in council , as I can foresee , will he be the most backward .</l>
     <l n="56">But thou keepest shut up in his breast all the poor fellow 's spirit ,</l>
     <l n="57">Finding such fault with him daily , and censuring as thou but now hast . ”</l>
     <l n="58">And on the instant she quitted the room , and after him hurried ,</l>
     <l n="59">Hoping she somewhere might find him , and might with her words of affection</l>
     <l n="60">Cheer him again , her excellent son , for well he deserved it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="61">Thereupon when she was gone , the father thus smiling continued :</l>
     <l n="62">“ What a strange folk , to be sure , are these women ; and just like the children ;</l>
     <l n="63">Both of them bent upon living according as suiteth their pleasure ,</l>
     <l n="64">While we others must never do aught but flatter and praise them .</l>
     <l n="65">Once for all time holds good the ancients ’ trustworthy proverb :</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="67">Thereupon answered and said , in a tone of reflection , the doctor :</l>
     <l n="68">“ That , sir neighbor , I willingly grant ; for myself I am always</l>
     <l n="69">Casting about for improvement ,— things new , so they be not too costly .</l>
     <l n="70">But what profits a man , who has not abundance of money ,</l>
     <l n="71">Being thus active and stirring , and bettering inside and outside ?</l>
     <l n="72">Only too much is the citizen cramped : the good , though he know it ,</l>
     <l n="73">Has he no means to acquire because too slender his purse is ,</l>
     <l n="74">While his needs are too great ; and thus is he constantly hampered .</l>
     <l n="75">Many the things I had done ; but then the cost of such changes</l>
     <l n="76">Who does not fear , especially now in this season of danger ?</l>
     <l n="77">Long since my house was smiling upon me in modish apparel !</l>
     <l n="78">Long since great panes of glass were gleaming in all of the windows !</l>
     <l n="79">But who can do as the merchant does , who , with his resources ,</l>
     <l n="80">Knows the methods as well by which the best is arrived at ?</l>
     <l n="81">Look at that house over yonder ,— the new one ; behold with what splendor</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Gainst the background of green stand out the white spirals of stucco !</l>
     <l n="83">Great are the panes in the windows ; and how the glass sparkles and glitters ,</l>
     <l n="84">Casting quite into the shade the rest of the market-place houses !</l>
     <l n="85">Yet just after the fire were our two houses the finest ,</l>
     <l n="86">This of the Golden Lion , and mine of the sign of the Angel .</l>
     <l n="87">So was my garden , too , throughout the whole neighborhood famous :</l>
     <l n="88">Every traveller stopped and gazed through the red palisadoes ,</l>
     <l n="89">Caught by the beggars there carved in stone and the dwarfs of bright colors .</l>
     <l n="90">Then whosoever had coffee served in the beautiful grotto ,—</l>
     <l n="91">Standing there now all covered with dust and Partly in ruins ,—</l>
     <l n="92">Used to be mightily pleased with the glimmering light of the mussels</l>
     <l n="93">Spread out in beautiful order ; and even the eye of the critic</l>
     <l n="94">Used by the sight of my corals and potter 's ore to be dazzled .</l>
     <l n="95">So in my parlor , too , they would always admire the painting ,</l>
     <l n="96">Where in a garden are gaily dressed ladies and gentlemen walking ,</l>
     <l n="97">And with their taper fingers are plucking and holding the flowers .</l>
     <l n="98">But who would look at it now ! In sooth , so great my vexation</l>
     <l n="99">Scarcely I venture abroad . All now must be other and tasteful ,</l>
     <l n="100">So they call it ; and white are the laths and benches of wood-work ;</l>
     <l n="101">Everything simple and smooth ; no carving longer or gilding</l>
     <l n="102">Can be endured , and the woods from abroad are of all the most costly .</l>
     <l n="103">Well , I too should be glad could I get for myself something novel ;</l>
     <l n="104">Glad to keep up with the times , and be changing my furniture often ;</l>
     <l n="105">Yet must we all be afraid of touching the veriest trifle .</l>
     <l n="106">For who among us has means for paying the work-people 's wages</l>
     <l n="107">Lately I had an idea of giving the Archangel Michael ,</l>
     <l n="108">Making the sign of my shop , another fresh coating of gilding ,</l>
     <l n="109">And to the terrible dragon about his feet that is winding ;</l>
     <l n="110">But I e'en let him stay browned as he is : I dreaded the charges . ”</l>

    <head>EUTERPE</head>
    <head>MOTHER AND SON</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Thus entertaining themselves , the men sat talking . The mother</l>
     <l n="2">Went meanwhile to look for her son in front of the dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="3">First on the settle of stone , whereon ‘ twas his wont to be seated .</l>
     <l n="4">When she perceived him not there , she went farther to look in the stable ,</l>
     <l n="5">If he were caring perhaps for his noble horses , the stallions ,</l>
     <l n="6">Which he as colts had bought , and whose care he intrusted to no one .</l>
     <l n="7">And by the servant she there was told : He is gone to the garden .</l>
     <l n="8">Then with a nimble step she traversed the long , double courtyards ,</l>
     <l n="9">Leaving the stables behind , and the well-builded barns , too , behind her ;</l>
     <l n="10">Entered the garden , that far as the walls of the city extended ;</l>
     <l n="11">Walked through its length , rejoiced as she went in every thing growing ;</l>
     <l n="12">Set upright the supports on which were resting the branches</l>
     <l n="13">Heavily laden with apples , and burdening boughs of the pear-tree .</l>
     <l n="14">Next some caterpillars removed from a stout , swelling cabbage ;</l>
     <l n="15">For an industrious woman allows no step to be wasted .</l>
     <l n="16">Thus was she come at last to the end of the far-reaching garden ,</l>
     <l n="17">Where stood the arbor embowered in woodbine ; nor there did she find him ,</l>
     <l n="18">More than she had hitherto in all her search through the garden .</l>
     <l n="19">But the wicket was standing ajar , which out of the arbor ,</l>
     <l n="20">Once by particular favor , had been through the walls of the city</l>
     <l n="21">Cut by a grandsire of hers , the worshipful burgomaster .</l>
     <l n="22">So the now dried-up moat she next crossed over with comfort ,</l>
     <l n="23">Where , by the side of the road , direct the well-fenced vineyard ,</l>
     <l n="24">Rose with a steep ascent , its slope exposed to the sunshine .</l>
     <l n="25">Up this also she went , and with pleasure as she was ascending</l>
     <l n="26">Marked the wealth of the clusters , that scarce by their leafage were hidden .</l>
     <l n="27">Shady and covered the way through the lofty middlemost alley ,</l>
     <l n="28">Which upon steps that were made of unhewn blocks you ascended .</l>
     <l n="29">There were the Muscatel , and there were the Chasselas hanging</l>
     <l n="30">Side by side , of unusual size and colored with purple ,</l>
     <l n="31">All set out with the purpose of decking the visitor 's table ;</l>
     <l n="32">While with single vine-stocks the rest of the hillside was covered ,</l>
     <l n="33">Bearing inferior clusters , from which the delicate wine comes .</l>
     <l n="34">Thus up the slope she went , enjoying already the vintage ,</l>
     <l n="35">And that festive day on which the whole country , rejoicing ,</l>
     <l n="36">Picks and tramples the grapes , and gathers the must into vessels :</l>
     <l n="37">Fireworks , when it is evening , from every direction and corner</l>
     <l n="38">Crackle and blaze , and so the fairest of harvests is honored .</l>
     <l n="39">But more uneasy she went , her son after twice or thrice calling ,</l>
     <l n="40">And no answer receiving , except from the talkative echo ,</l>
     <l n="41">That with many repeats rang back from the towers of the city .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="42">Strange it was for her to seek him ; he never had gone to a distance</l>
     <l n="43">That he told her not first , to spare his affectionate mother</l>
     <l n="44">Every anxious thought , and fear that aught ill had befallen .</l>
     <l n="45">Still did she constantly hope that , if further she went , she should find him ;</l>
     <l n="46">For the two doors of the vineyard , the lower as well as the upper ,</l>
     <l n="47">Both were alike standing open . So now she entered the cornfield ,</l>
     <l n="48">That with its broad expanse the ridge of the hill covered over .</l>
     <l n="49">Still was the ground that she walked on her own ; and the crops she rejoiced in ,—</l>
     <l n="50">All of them still were hers , and hers was the proud-waving grain , too ,</l>
     <l n="51">Over the whole broad field in golden strength that was stirring .</l>
     <l n="52">Keeping the ridgeway , the footpath , between the fields she went onward ,</l>
     <l n="53">Having the lofty pear-tree in view , which stood on the summit ,</l>
     <l n="54">And was the boundary-mark of the fields that belonged to her dwelling .</l>
     <l n="55">Who might have planted it , none could know , but visible was it</l>
     <l n="56">Far and wide through the country ; the fruit of the pear-tree was famous .</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Neath it the reapers were wont to enjoy their meal at the noon-day ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the shepherds were used to tend their flocks in its shadow .</l>
     <l n="59">Benches of unhewn stones and of turf they found set about it .</l>
     <l n="60">And she had not been mistaken , for there sat her Hermann , and rested ,—</l>
     <l n="61">Sat with his head on his hand , and seemed to be viewing the landscape</l>
     <l n="62">That to the mountains lay : his back was turned to his mother .</l>
     <l n="63">Towards him softly she crept , and lightly touched on the shoulder ;</l>
     <l n="64">Quick he turned himself round : there were tears in his eyes as he met her .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="65">“ Mother , how hast thou surprised me ! ” he said in confusion ; and quickly</l>
     <l n="66">Wiped the high-spirited youth his tears away . But the mother ,</l>
     <l n="67">“ What ! do I find thee weeping , my son ? ” exclaimed in amazement .</l>
     <l n="68">“ Nay , that is not like thyself : I never before have so seen thee !</l>
     <l n="69">Tell me , what burdens thy heart ? what drives thee here , to be sitting</l>
     <l n="70">Under the pear-tree alone ? These tears in thine eyes , what has brought them ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="71">Then , collecting himself , the excellent youth made her answer :</l>
     <l n="72">“ Truly no heart can that man have in his bosom of iron ,</l>
     <l n="73">Who is insensible now to the needs of this emigrant people ;</l>
     <l n="74">He has no brains in his head , who not for his personal safety ,</l>
     <l n="75">Not for his fatherland 's weal , in days like the present is anxious .</l>
     <l n="76">Deeply my heart had been touched by the sights and sounds of the morning ;</l>
     <l n="77">Then I went forth and beheld the broad and glorious landscape</l>
     <l n="78">Spreading its fertile slopes in every direction about us ,</l>
     <l n="79">Saw the golden grain inclining itself to the reapers ,</l>
     <l n="80">And the promise of well-filled barns from the plentiful harvest .</l>
     <l n="81">But , alas , how near is the foe ! The Rhine with its waters</l>
     <l n="82">Guards us , indeed ; but , ah , what now are rivers and mountains</l>
     <l n="83">‘ Gainst that terrible people that onward bears like a tempest !</l>
     <l n="84">For they summon their youths from every quarter together ,</l>
     <l n="85">Call up their old men too , and press with violence forward .</l>
     <l n="86">Death cannot frighten the crowd : one multitude follows another .</l>
     <l n="87">And shall a German dare to linger behind in his homestead ?</l>
     <l n="88">Hopes he perhaps to escape the everywhere threatening evil ?</l>
     <l n="89">Nay , dear mother , I tell thee , to-day has made me regretful</l>
     <l n="90">That I was lately exempt , when out of our townsmen were chosen</l>
     <l n="91">Those who should serve in the army . An only son I am truly ,</l>
     <l n="92">Also our business is great , and the charge of our household is weighty .</l>
     <l n="93">Yet were it better , I deem , in the front to offer resistance</l>
     <l n="94">There on the border , than here to await disaster and bondage .</l>
     <l n="95">So has my spirit declared , and deep in my innermost bosom</l>
     <l n="96">Courage and longing have now been aroused to live for my country ,</l>
     <l n="97">Yea , and to die , presenting to others a worthy example .</l>
     <l n="98">If but the strength of Germany 's youth were banded together</l>
     <l n="99">There on the frontier , resolved that it never would yield to the stranger ,</l>
     <l n="100">Ah , he should not on our glorious soil be setting his foot-steps ,</l>
     <l n="101">Neither consuming before our eyes the fruit of our labor ,</l>
     <l n="102">Ruling our men , and making his prey of our wives and our daughters .</l>
     <l n="103">Hark to me , mother : for I in the depths of my heart am determined</l>
     <l n="104">Quickly to do , and at once , what appears to me right and in reason ;</l>
     <l n="105">For he chooses not always the best who longest considers .</l>
     <l n="106">Hearken , I shall not again return to the house ; but directly</l>
     <l n="107">Go from this spot to the city , and there present to the soldiers</l>
     <l n="108">This right arm and this heart , to be spent in the fatherland 's service .</l>
     <l n="109">Then let my father say if there be no feeling of honor</l>
     <l n="110">Dwelling within my breast , nor a wish to raise myself higher . ”</l>
     <l n="111">Then with significant words spoke the good and intelligent mother ,</l>
     <l n="112">While from her eyes the quick-starting tears were silently falling :</l>

     <l n="181">But , alas ! saving alone , for the sake of a tardy enjoyment ,—</l>

     <l n="1">HERE the three men , however , still sat conversing together ,</l>
     <l n="2">With mine host of the Lion , the village doctor , and pastor ;</l>
     <l n="3">And their talk was still on the same unvarying subject ,</l>
     <l n="4">Turning it this way and that , and viewing from every direction .</l>
     <l n="5">But with his sober judgment the excellent pastor made answer :</l>
     <l n="6">“ Here will I not contradict you . I know that man should be always</l>
     <l n="7">Striving for that which is better ; indeed , as we see , he is reaching</l>

     <l n="9">But be careful ye go not too far , for with this disposition</l>
     <l n="10">Nature has given us pleasure in holding to what is familiar ;</l>
     <l n="11">Taught us in that to delight to which we have long been accustomed .</l>
     <l n="12">Every condition is good that is founded on reason and nature .</l>
     <l n="13">Many are man 's desires , yet little it is that he needeth ;</l>
     <l n="14">Seeing the days are short and mortal destiny bounded .</l>
     <l n="15">Ne'er would I censure the man whom a restless activity urges ,</l>
     <l n="16">Bold and industrious , over all pathways of land and of ocean ,</l>
     <l n="17">Ever untiring to roam ; who takes delight in the riches ,</l>
     <l n="18">Heaping in generous abundance about himself and his children .</l>
     <l n="19">Yet not unprized by me is the quiet citizen also ,</l>
     <l n="20">Making the noiseless round of his own inherited acres ,</l>

     <l n="27">Few are the seeds he intrusts to earth 's all-nourishing bosom ;</l>
     <l n="28">Few are the creatures he knows how to raise and bring to perfection .</l>

     <l n="34">Nor is he carried away by the greedy ambition of cities ;</l>

     <l n="56">But the father was silent . Then hastily rose the good pastor ,</l>

     <l n="63">Hermann is pure . From childhood up I have known him , and never</l>

     <l n="65">What he desired was best for him too , and he held to it firmly .</l>
     <l n="66">Be not surprised and alarmed that now has appeared of a sudden ,</l>
     <l n="67">What thou hast wished for so long . It is true that the present appearance</l>
     <l n="68">Bears not the form of the wish , exactly as thou hadst conceived it :</l>
     <l n="69">For our wishes oft hide from ourselves the object we wish for ;</l>
     <l n="70">Gifts come down from above in the shapes appointed by Heaven .</l>
     <l n="71">Therefore misjudge not the maiden who now of thy dearly beloved ,</l>

     <l n="76">Genuine love matures in a moment the youth into manhood ;</l>
     <l n="77">He is not easily moved ; and I fear that if this be refused him ,</l>

     <l n="115">But I will not oppose you , thus banded together : how could I ?</l>
     <l n="116">For I already perceive here tears and defiance beforehand .</l>
     <l n="117">Go ye therefore , inquire , in God 's name , bring me the daughter .</l>
     <l n="118">But if not so , then the boy is to think no more of the maiden . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="119">Thus the father . The son cried out with joyful demeanor ,</l>
     <l n="120">“ Ere it is evening the noblest of daughters shall hither be brought you ,</l>
     <l n="121">Such as no man with sound sense in his breast can fail to be pleased with .</l>
     <l n="122">Happy , I venture to hope , will be also the excellent maiden .</l>
     <l n="123">Yes ; she will ever be grateful for having had father and mother</l>
     <l n="124">Given once more in you , and such as a child most delights in .</l>
     <l n="125">Now I will tarry no longer , but straightway harness the horses ,</l>
     <l n="126">Drive forth our friends at once on the footsteps of my beloved ,</l>
     <l n="127">Leaving them then to act for themselves , as their wisdom shall dictate ,</l>
     <l n="128">Guide myself wholly , I promise , according to what they determine ,</l>
     <l n="129">And , until I may call her my own , ne'er look on the maiden . ”</l>
     <l n="130">Thus he went forth : the others meanwhile remained in discussion ,</l>
     <l n="131">Rapid and earnest , considering deeply their great undertaking .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="132">Hermann hasted straightway to the stable , where quietly standing</l>
     <l n="133">Found he the spirited stallions , the clean oats quickly devouring ,</l>
     <l n="134">And the well-dried hay that was cut from the richest of meadows .</l>
     <l n="135">On them without delay the shining bits he adjusted ,</l>
     <l n="136">Hastily drew the straps through the buckles of beautiful plating ,</l>
     <l n="137">Firmly fastened then the long broad reins , and the horses</l>
     <l n="138">Led without to the court-yard , whither the willing assistant</l>
     <l n="139">Had with ease , by the pole , already drawn forward the carriage .</l>
     <l n="140">Next to the whipple-tree they with care by the neatly kept traces</l>
     <l n="141">Joined the impetuous strength of the freely travelling horses .</l>
     <l n="142">Whip in hand took Hermann his seat and drove under the doorway .</l>
     <l n="143">Soon as the friends straightway their commodious places had taken ,</l>
     <l n="144">Quickly the carriage rolled off , and left the pavement behind it ,</l>
     <l n="145">Left behind it the walls of the town and the fresh-whitened towers .</l>
     <l n="146">Thus drove Hermann on till he came to the well-known causeway .</l>
     <l n="147">Rapidly , loitering nowhere , but hastening up hill and down hill .</l>
     <l n="148">But as he now before him perceived the spire of the village ,</l>
     <l n="149">And no longer remote the garden-girt houses were lying ,</l>
     <l n="150">Then in himself he thought that here he would rein up the horses .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="151">Under the solemn shade of lofty linden-trees lying ,</l>
     <l n="152">Which for centuries past upon this spot had been rooted ,</l>
     <l n="153">Spread in front of the village a broad and grass-covered common ,</l>
     <l n="154">Favorite place of resort for the peasants and neighboring townsfolk .</l>
     <l n="155">Here , at the foot of the trees , sunk deep in the ground was a well-spring ;</l>
     <l n="156">When you descended the steps , stone benches you found at the bottom ,</l>
     <l n="157">Stationed about the spring , whose pure , living waters were bubbling</l>
     <l n="158">Ceaselessly forth , hemmed in by low walls for convenience of drawing .</l>
     <l n="159">Hermann resolved that here he would halt , with his horses and carriage ,</l>
     <l n="160">Under the shade of the trees . He did so , and said to the others ;</l>
     <l n="161">“ Here alight , my friends , and go your ways to discover</l>
     <l n="162">Whether the maiden in truth be worthy the hand that I offer .</l>
     <l n="163">That , she is so , I believe ; naught new or strange will ye tell me .</l>
     <l n="164">Had I to act for myself , I should go with speed to the village ,</l>
     <l n="165">Where a few words from the maiden 's own lips should determine my fortune .</l>
     <l n="166">Ye will with readiness single her out from all of the others ,</l>
     <l n="167">For there can scarcely be one that to her may be likened in bearing .</l>
     <l n="168">But I will give you , besides , her modest attire for a token :</l>
     <l n="169">Mark , then , the stomacher 's scarlet , that sets off the arch of her bosom ,</l>
     <l n="170">Prettily laced , and the bodice of black fitting close to her figure ;</l>
     <l n="171">Neatly the edge of her kerchief is plaited into a ruffle ,</l>
     <l n="172">Which with a simple grace her chin 's rounded outline encircles ;</l>
     <l n="173">Freely and lightly rises above it the head 's dainty oval ;</l>
     <l n="174">And her luxuriant hair over silver bodkins is braided ;</l>
     <l n="175">Down from under her bodice , the full , blue petticoat falling ,</l>
     <l n="176">Wraps itself , when she is walking , about her neatly shaped ankles .</l>
     <l n="177">Yet one thing will I say , and would make it my earnest petition ,—</l>
     <l n="178">Speak not yourselves with the maiden , nor let your intent be discovered ;</l>
     <l n="179">Rather inquire of others , and hearken to what they may tell you .</l>
     <l n="180">When ye have tidings enough to satisfy father and mother ,</l>
     <l n="181">Then return to me here , and we will consider what further .</l>
     <l n="182">So did I plan it all out in my mind while driving you hither . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="183">Thus he spoke . The friends thereupon went their way to the village ,</l>
     <l n="184">Where , in the houses and gardens and barns , the people were swarming ;</l>
     <l n="185">Wagons on wagons stood crowded together along the broad highway .</l>
     <l n="186">Men for the harnessed horses and lowing cattle were caring ,</l>
     <l n="187">While the women were busy in drying their clothes on the hedges ,</l>
     <l n="188">And in the running brook the children were merrily splashing .</l>
     <l n="189">Making their way through the pressure of wagons , of people and cattle ,</l>
     <l n="190">Went the commissioned spies , and to right and to left looked about them ,</l>
     <l n="191">If they a figure might see that answered the maiden 's description ;</l>
     <l n="192">But not one of them all appeared the beautiful damsel .</l>
     <l n="193">Denser soon grew the press . A contest arose round the wagons</l>
     <l n="194">‘ Mongst the threatening men , wherein blended the cries of the women .</l>
     <l n="195">Rapidly then to the spot , and with dignified step , came an elder ,</l>
     <l n="196">Joined the clamoring group , and straightway the uproar was silenced ,</l>
     <l n="197">As he commanded peace , and rebuked with a fatherly sternness .</l>
     <l n="198">“ Has , then , misfortune , ” he cried , “ not yet so bound us together ,</l>
     <l n="199">That we have finally learned to bear and forbear one another ,</l>
     <l n="200">Though each one , it may be , do not measure his share of the labor ?</l>
     <l n="201">He that is happy , forsooth , is contentious ! Will sufferings never</l>
     <l n="202">Teach you to cease from your brawls of old between brother and brother ?</l>
     <l n="203">Grudge not one to another a place on the soil of the stranger ;</l>
     <l n="204">Rather divide what ye have , as yourselves , ye would hope to find mercy . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="205">Thus spoke the man and all became silent : restored to good humor ,</l>
     <l n="206">Peaceably then the people arranged their cattle and wagons .</l>
     <l n="207">But when the clergyman now had heard what was said by the stranger ,</l>
     <l n="208">And had the steadfast mind of the foreign justice discovered ,</l>
     <l n="209">He to the man drew near and with words of meaning addressed him :</l>
     <l n="210">“ True it is , father , that when in prosperity people are living ,</l>
     <l n="211">Feeding themselves from the earth , which far and wide opens her bosom ,</l>
     <l n="212">And in the years and months renews the coveted blessings ,—</l>
     <l n="213">All goes on of itself , and each himself deems the wisest ,</l>
     <l n="214">Deems the best , and so they continue abiding together ,</l>
     <l n="215">He of greatest intelligence ranking no higher than others ;</l>
     <l n="216">All that occurs , as if of itself , going quietly forward .</l>
     <l n="217">But let disaster unsettle the usual course of existence ,</l>
     <l n="218">Tear down the buildings about us , lay waste the crops and the garden ,</l>
     <l n="219">Banish the husband and wife from their old , familiar-grown dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="220">Drive them to wander abroad through nights and days of privation ,—</l>
     <l n="221">Then , ah then ! we look round us to see what man is the wisest ,</l>
     <l n="222">And no longer in vain his glorious words will be spoken .</l>
     <l n="223">Tell me , art thou not judge among this fugitive people ,</l>
     <l n="224">Father , who thus in an instant canst bid their passions be quiet ?</l>
     <l n="225">Thou dost appear to-day as one of those earliest leaders ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="228">Then with serious look the magistrate answered him , saying :</l>

     <l n="232">He has already lived years , events are so crowded together .</l>
     <l n="233">If I look back but a little , it seems that my head must be hoary</l>
     <l n="234">Under the burden of years , and yet my strength is still active .</l>
     <l n="235">Well may we of this day compare ourselves unto that people</l>
     <l n="236">Who , from the burning bush , beheld in the hour of their danger</l>

     <l n="238">Seeing the priest was inclined to speak yet more with the stranger ,</l>

     <l n="1">Now when the foreign judge had been by the minister questioned</l>
     <l n="2">As to his people 's distress , and how long their exile had lasted ,</l>
     <l n="3">Thus made answer the man : “ Of no recent date are our sorrows ;</l>

     <l n="5">Bitterness all the more dreadful because such fair hope had been blighted .</l>

     <l n="9">When of the rights of men we heard , which to all should be common ,</l>
     <l n="10">Were of a righteous equality told , and inspiriting freedom ?</l>
     <l n="11">Every one hoped that then he should live his own life , and the fetters ,</l>

     <l n="13">Fetters that had in the hand of sloth been held and self-seeking .</l>
     <l n="14">Looked not the eyes of all nations , throughout that calamitous season ,</l>
     <l n="15">Towards the world 's capital city , for so it had long been considered ,</l>
     <l n="16">And of that glorious title was now , more than ever , deserving ?</l>

     <l n="20">And , as neighbors , we , first of all , were zealously kindled .</l>
     <l n="21">Thereupon followed the war , and armed bodies of Frenchmen</l>
     <l n="22">Pressed to us nearer ; yet nothing but friendship they seemed to be bringing ;</l>
     <l n="23">Ay , and they brought it too ; for exalted the spirit within them :</l>
     <l n="24">They with rejoicing the festive trees of liberty planted ,</l>
     <l n="25">Promising every man what was his own , and to each his own ruling .</l>
     <l n="26">High beat the heart of the youths , and even the aged were joyful ;</l>
     <l n="27">Gaily the dance began about the newly raised standard .</l>

     <l n="30">Then the hearts of the women with irresistible graces .</l>
     <l n="31">Even the pressure of hungry war seemed to weigh on us lightly ,</l>

     <l n="34">Oh , how joyful the time when with her belov'ed the maiden</l>
     <l n="35">Whirls in the dance , the longed-for day of their union awaiting !</l>

     <l n="38">Loosened was every tongue , and men — the aged , the stripling —</l>
     <l n="39">Spoke aloud in words that were full of high feeling and wisdom .</l>
     <l n="40">Soon , however , the sky was o'ercast . A corrupt generation</l>
     <l n="41">Fought for the right of dominion , unworthy the good to establish ;</l>
     <l n="42">So that they slew one another , their new-made neighbors and brothers</l>
     <l n="43">Held in subjection , and then sent the self-seeking masses against us .</l>
     <l n="44">Chiefs committed excesses and wholesale plunder upon us ,</l>
     <l n="45">While those lower plundered and rioted down to the lowest :</l>
     <l n="46">Every one seemed but to care that something be left for the morrow .</l>
     <l n="47">Great past endurance the need , and daily grew the oppression :</l>
     <l n="48">They were the lords of the day ; there was none to hear our complaining .</l>
     <l n="49">Then fell trouble and rage upon even the quietest spirit .</l>
     <l n="50">One thought only had all , and swore for their wrongs to have vengeance ,</l>

     <l n="52">Presently Fortune turned and declared on the side of the German ,</l>
     <l n="53">And with hurried marches the French retreated before us .</l>
     <l n="54">Ah ! then as never before did we feel the sad fortunes of warfare :</l>
     <l n="55">He that is victor is great and good ,— or at least he appears SO ,—</l>

     <l n="60">Then are his passions also inflamed : the despair that is in him</l>
     <l n="61">Out of his heart breaks forth , and takes shape in criminal action .</l>
     <l n="62">Nothing is further held sacred ; but all is for plunder . His craving</l>
     <l n="63">Turns in fury on woman , and pleasure is changed into horror .</l>
     <l n="64">Death he sees everywhere round him , and madly enjoys his last moments ,</l>

     <l n="127">Bring too the magistrate with thee , that so we may hear him yet further . ”</l>
     <l n="128">But as they turned to go , the justice was summoned to leave them ,</l>
     <l n="129">Sent for by some of his people by whom his counsel was needed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="130">Straightway the preacher , however , the lead of the doctor had followed</l>
     <l n="131">Up to a gap in the fence where his finger he meaningly pointed .</l>
     <l n="132">“ Seest thou the maiden ? ” he said : “ she has made some clothes for the baby</l>
     <l n="133">Out of the well-known chintz ,— I distinguish it plainly ; and further</l>
     <l n="134">There are the covers of blue that Hermann gave in his bundle .</l>
     <l n="135">Well and quickly , forsooth , she has turned to advantage the presents .</l>
     <l n="136">Evident tokens are these , and all else answers well the description .</l>
     <l n="137">Mark how the stomacher 's scarlet sets off the arch of her bosom ,</l>
     <l n="138">Prettily laced , and the bodice of black fits close to her figure ;</l>
     <l n="139">Neatly the edge of her kerchief is plaited into a ruffle ,</l>
     <l n="140">Which , with a simple grace , her chin 's rounded outline encircles ;</l>
     <l n="141">Freely and lightly rises above it the bead 's dainty oval ,</l>
     <l n="142">And her luxuriant hair over silver bodkins is braided .</l>
     <l n="143">Now she is sitting , yet still we behold her majestical stature ,</l>
     <l n="144">And the blue petticoat 's ample plaits , that down from her bosom</l>
     <l n="145">Hangs in abundant folds about her neatly shaped ankles ,</l>
     <l n="146">She without question it is ; come , therefore , and let us discover</l>
     <l n="147">Whether she honest and virtuous be , a housewifely maiden . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="148">Then , as the seated figure he studied , the pastor made answer :</l>
     <l n="149">“ Truly , I find it no wonder that she so enchanted the stripling ,</l>
     <l n="150">Since , to a man 's experienced eye , she seems lacking in nothing .</l>
     <l n="151">Happy to whom mother Nature a shape harmonious has given !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="152">“ Such will always commend him , and he can be nowhere a stranger .</l>
     <l n="153">All approach with delight , and all are delighted to linger ,</l>
     <l n="154">If to the outward shape correspond but a courteous spirit .</l>
     <l n="155">I can assure thee , in her the youth has found him a maiden ,</l>
     <l n="156">Who , in the days to come , his life shall gloriously brighten ,</l>
     <l n="157">Standing with womanly strength in every necessity by him .</l>
     <l n="158">Surely the soul must be pure that inhabits a body so perfect ,</l>
     <l n="159">And of a happy old age such vigorous youth is the promise . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="160">Thereupon answered and said the doctor in language of caution :</l>
     <l n="161">“ Often appearances cheat ; I like not to trust to externals .</l>
     <l n="162">For I have oft seen put to the test the truth of the proverb :</l>
     <l n="163">Till thou a bushel of salt with a new acquaintance hast eaten ,</l>
     <l n="164">Be not too ready to trust him ; for time alone renders thee certain</l>
     <l n="165">How ye shall fare with each other , and how well your friendship shall prosper .</l>
     <l n="166">Let us then rather at first make inquiries among the good people</l>
     <l n="167">By whom the maiden is known , and who can inform us about her . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="168">“ Much I approve of thy caution , ” the preacher replied as he followed .</l>
     <l n="169">“ Not for ourselves is the suit , and ‘ tis delicate wooing for others . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="170">Towards the good magistrate , then , the men directed their footsteps ,</l>
     <l n="171">Who was again ascending the street in discharge of his duties .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="172">Him the judicious pastor at once addressed and with caution .</l>
     <l n="173">“ Look ! we a maiden have here descried in the neighboring garden ,</l>
     <l n="174">Under an apple-tree sitting , and making up garments for children</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="175">“ Out of second-hand stuff that somebody doubtless has given ;</l>
     <l n="176">And we were pleased with her aspect : she seems like a girl to be trusted .</l>
     <l n="177">Tell us whatever thou knowest : we ask it with honest intentions . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="178">Soon as the magistrate nearer had come , and looked into the garden ,</l>
     <l n="179">“ Her thou knowest already , ” he said ; “ for when I was telling</l>
     <l n="180">Of the heroic deed performed by the hand of that maiden ,</l>
     <l n="181">When she snatched the man 's sword , and delivered herself and her charges ,</l>
     <l n="182">This was the one ! she is vigorous born , as thou seest by her stature ;</l>
     <l n="183">Yet she is good as strong , for her aged kinsman she tended</l>
     <l n="184">Until the day of his death , which was finally hastened by sorrow</l>
     <l n="185">Over his city 's distress , and his own endangered possessions .</l>
     <l n="186">Also , with quiet submission , she bore the death of her lover ,</l>
     <l n="187">Who a high-spirited youth , in the earliest flush of excitement ,</l>
     <l n="188">Kindled by lofty resolve to fight for a glorious freedom ,</l>
     <l n="189">Hurried to Paris , where early a terrible death he encountered .</l>
     <l n="190">For as at home , so there , his foes were deceit and oppression . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="191">Thus the magistrate spoke . The others saluted and thanked him ,</l>
     <l n="192">And from his purse a gold-piece the pastor drew forth :— for the silver</l>
     <l n="193">He had some hours before already in charity given ,</l>
     <l n="194">When he in mournful groups had seen the poor fugitives passing ;—</l>
     <l n="195">And to the magistrate handed it , saying : “ Apportion the money</l>
     <l n="196">‘ Mongst thy destitute people , and God vouchsafe it an increase . ”</l>
     <l n="197">But the stranger declined it , and , answering , said : “ We have rescued</l>
     <l n="198">Many a dollar among us , with clothing and other possessions ,</l>
     <l n="199">And shall return , as I hope , ere yet our stock is exhausted . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="200">Then the pastor replied , and pressed the money upon him :</l>
     <l n="201">“ None should be backward in giving in days like the present , and no one</l>
     <l n="202">Ought to refuse to accept those gifts which in kindness are offered .</l>
     <l n="203">None can tell how long he may hold what in peace he possesses ,</l>
     <l n="204">None how much longer yet he shall roam through the land of the stranger ,</l>
     <l n="205">And of his farm be deprived , and deprived of the garden that feeds him . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="206">“ Ay , to be sure ! ” in his bustling way interrupted the doctor :</l>
     <l n="207">“ If I had only some money about me , ye surely should have it ,</l>
     <l n="208">Little and big ; for certainly many among you must need it .</l>
     <l n="209">Yet I 'll not go without giving thee something to show what my will is ,</l>
     <l n="210">Even though sadly behind my good-will must lag the performance . ”</l>
     <l n="211">Thus , as he spoke , by its straps his embroidered pocket of leather ,</l>
     <l n="212">Where his tobacco was kept , he drew forth ,— enough was now in it</l>
     <l n="213">Several pipes to fill ,— and daintily opened , and portioned .</l>
     <l n="214">“ Small is the gift , ” he added . The justice , however , made answer :</l>
     <l n="215">“ Good tobacco can ne'er to the traveller fail to be welcome . ”</l>
     <l n="216">Then did the village doctor begin to praise his canister .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="217">But the clergyman drew him away , and they quitted the justice .</l>
     <l n="218">“ Let us make haste , ” said the thoughtful man : “ the youth 's waiting in torture ;</l>
     <l n="219">Come I let him hear , as soon as he may , the jubilant tidings . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="220">So they hastened their steps , and came to where under the lindens</l>
     <l n="221">Hermann against the carriage was leaning . The horses were stamping</l>
     <l n="222">Wildly the turf ; he held them in check , and , buried in musing ,</l>
     <l n="223">Stood , into vacancy gazing before him ; nor saw the two envoys ,</l>
     <l n="224">Till , as they came , they called out and made to him signals of triumph .</l>
     <l n="225">E'en as far off as they then were , the doctor began to address him ;</l>
     <l n="226">But they were presently nearer come and then the good pastor</l>
     <l n="227">Grasped his hand and exclaimed , interrupting the word of his comrade :</l>
     <l n="228">“ Hail to thee , O young man ! thy true eye and heart have well chosen ;</l>
     <l n="229">Joy be to thee and the wife of thy youth ; for of thee she is worthy .</l>
     <l n="230">Come then and turn us the wagon , and drive straightway to the village ,</l>
     <l n="231">There the good maid to woo , and soon bring her home to thy dwelling . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="232">Still , however , the young man stood , without sign of rejoicing</l>
     <l n="233">Hearing his messenger 's words , though heavenly they were and consoling .</l>
     <l n="234">Deeply he sighed as he said : “ With hurrying wheels we came hither ,</l>
     <l n="235">And shall be forced , perchance , to go mortified homeward and slowly .</l>
     <l n="236">For disquiet has fallen upon me since here I 've been waiting ,</l>
     <l n="237">Doubt and suspicion and all that can torture the heart of a lover .</l>
     <l n="238">Think ye we have but to come , and that then the maiden will follow</l>
     <l n="239">Merely because we are rich , while she is poor and an exile ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="240">“ Poverty , too , makes proud , when it comes unmerited ! Active</l>
     <l n="241">Seems she to be , and contented , and so of the world is she mistress .</l>
     <l n="242">Think ye a maiden like her , with the manners and beauty that she has ,</l>
     <l n="243">Can into woman have grown , and no worthy man 's love have attracted ?</l>
     <l n="244">Think ye that love until now can have been shut out from her bosom ?</l>
     <l n="245">Drive not thither too rashly : we might to our mortification</l>
     <l n="246">Have to turn softly homewards our horses ’ heads . For my fear is</l>
     <l n="247">That to some youth already this heart has been given ; already</l>
     <l n="248">This brave hand has been clasped , has pledged faith to some fortunate lover .</l>
     <l n="249">Then with my offer , alas ! I should stand in confusion before her . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="24">
     <l n="250">Straightway the pastor had opened his lips to speak consolation ,</l>
     <l n="251">When his companion broke in , and said in his voluble fashion :</l>
     <l n="252">“ Years ago , forsooth , unknown had been such a dilemma .</l>
     <l n="253">All such affairs were then conducted in regular fashion .</l>
     <l n="254">Soon as a bride for their son had been by the parents selected ,</l>
     <l n="255">First some family friend they into their councils would summon ,</l>
     <l n="256">Whom they afterwards sent as a suitor to visit the parents</l>
     <l n="257">Of the elected bride . Arrayed in his finest apparel ,</l>
     <l n="258">Soon after dinner on Sunday he sought the respectable burgher ,</l>
     <l n="259">When some friendly words were exchanged upon general subjects ,</l>
     <l n="260">He knowing how to direct the discourse as suited his purpose .</l>
     <l n="261">After much circumlocution he finally mentioned the daughter ,</l>
     <l n="262">Praising her highly ; and praising the man and the house that had sent him .</l>
     <l n="263">Persons of tact perceived his intent , and the politic envoy</l>
     <l n="264">Readily saw how their minds were disposed , and explained himself further .</l>
     <l n="265">Then were the offer declined , e'en the ‘ no ’ brought not mortification ;</l>
     <l n="266">But did it meet with success , the suitor was ever thereafter</l>
     <l n="267">Made the chief guest in the house on every festive occasion .</l>
     <l n="268">For , through the rest of their lives , the couple ne'er failed to remember</l>
     <l n="269">That ‘ twas by his experienced hand the first knot had been gathered .</l>
     <l n="270">All that , however , is changed , and , with many another good custom ,</l>
     <l n="271">Quite fallen out of the fashion ; for every man woos for himself now .</l>
     <l n="272">Therefore let every man hear to his face pronounced the refusal ,</l>
     <l n="273">If a refusal there be , and stand shamed in the sight of the maiden ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="25">
     <l n="274">“ Let that be as it may ! ” made answer the youth , who had scarcely</l>
     <l n="275">Unto the words paid heed ; but in silence had made his decision .</l>
     <l n="276">“ I will go thither myself , will myself hear my destiny spoken</l>
     <l n="277">Out of the lips of a maiden in whom I a confidence cherish</l>
     <l n="278">Greater than heart of man has e'er before cherished in woman .</l>
     <l n="279">Say what she will , ‘ twill be good and wise ; of that I am certain .</l>
     <l n="280">Should I behold her never again , yet this once will I see her ;</l>
     <l n="281">Yet this once the clear gaze of those dark eyes will encounter ,</l>
     <l n="282">If I must press her ne'er to my heart , yet that neck and that bosom</l>
     <l n="283">Will I behold once more , that my arm so longs to encircle ;</l>
     <l n="284">Once more that mouth will see , whose kiss and whose ‘ yes ’ would for ever</l>
     <l n="285">Render me happy , from which a ‘ no ’ will for ever destroy me .</l>
     <l n="286">But ye must leave me alone . Do not wait for me here ; but return ye</l>
     <l n="287">Back to my father and mother again , and give them the knowledge</l>
     <l n="288">That their son has not been deceived , that the maiden is worthy .</l>
     <l n="289">So then leave me alone ! I shall follow the footpath that crosses</l>
     <l n="290">Over the hill by the pear-tree , and thence descends through our vineyard ,</l>
     <l n="291">Taking a shorter way home . And oh , may I bring to our dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="292">Joyful and quick my beloved ! but perhaps I alone may come creeping</l>
     <l n="293">Over that path to the house , and ne'er again tread it with gladness . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="26">
     <l n="294">Thus he spoke , and gave up the reins to the hand of the pastor ,</l>
     <l n="295">Who understandingly grasped them , the foaming horses controlling ,</l>
     <l n="296">Speedily mounted the carriage , and sat in the seat of the driver .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="27">
     <l n="297">But thou didst hesitate , provident neighbor , and say in remonstrance :</l>

     <l n="299">But as for life and limb , they are not in the safest of keeping ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="28">
     <l n="301">But thou didst laugh at his words , intelligent pastor , and answer :</l>

     <l n="303">For , in holding the reins , my hand grew long ago skilful ,</l>
     <l n="304">Long has my eye been trained in making the nicest of turnings ;</l>
     <l n="305">For we were practised well in driving the carriage in Strasburg ,</l>
     <l n="306">When I the youthful baron accompanied thither ; then daily</l>
     <l n="307">Rolled the carriage , guided by me , through the echoing gateway ,</l>
     <l n="308">Out over dusty roads till we reached the meadows and lindens ,</l>
     <l n="309">Steering through groups of the town'shYpppHeNfolk beguiling the day there with walking . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="29">
     <l n="310">Thereupon , half-reassured , the neighbor ascended the wagon ,</l>
     <l n="311">Sat like one who for a prudent leap is holding him ready ,</l>
     <l n="312">And the stallions sped rapidly homeward , desiring their stable .</l>
     <l n="313">Clouds of dust whirled up from under their powerful hoofbeats .</l>
     <l n="314">Long the youth stood there yet , and saw the dust in its rising ,</l>
     <l n="315">Saw the dust as it settled again : he stood there unheeding .</l>

     <l n="1">Like as the traveller , who , when the sun is approaching its setting ,</l>

     <l n="3">Then on the sides of the rocks , and on all the darkening bushes ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sees its hovering image ; whatever direction he look in</l>
     <l n="5">That hastes before , and flickers and gleams in radiant colors ,—</l>
     <l n="6">So before Hermann 's eyes moved the beautiful shape of the maiden</l>
     <l n="7">Softly , and seeming to follow the path that led into the cornfield .</l>
     <l n="8">But he aroused from his wildering dream and turned himself slowly</l>
     <l n="9">Towards where the village lay and was wildered again ; for again came</l>
     <l n="10">Moving to meet him the lofty form of the glorious maiden .</l>
     <l n="11">Fixedly gazed he upon her ; herself it was and no phantom .</l>
     <l n="12">Bearing in either hand a larger jar and a smaller ,</l>

     <l n="51">That he of love should speak ; her eye told not of affection ,</l>
     <l n="52">Only of clear understanding , requiring intelligent answer .</l>
     <l n="53">And he composed himself quickly , and cordially said to the maiden :</l>
     <l n="54">“ Hearken to me , my child , and let me reply to thy question .</l>

     <l n="58">Being an only son , and because our affairs are extensive .</l>
     <l n="59">Mine is the charge of the farm ; my father bears rule in the household ;</l>

     <l n="62">Now through deceit , and now through their carelessness , harass the mistress ,</l>
     <l n="63">Forcing her ever to change and replace one fault with another .</l>
     <l n="64">Long for that reason my mother has wished for a maid in the household ,</l>
     <l n="65">Who not with hand alone , but with heart , too , will lend her assistance ,</l>
     <l n="66">Taking the daughter 's place , whom , alas ! she was early deprived of .</l>
     <l n="67">How when to-day by the wagon I saw thee , so ready and cheerful ,</l>
     <l n="68">Witnessed the strength of thine arms , and thy limbs of such healthful proportion ,</l>
     <l n="69">When thy intelligent speech I heard , I was smitten with wonder .</l>
     <l n="70">Hastening homeward , I there to my parents and neighbors the stranger</l>
     <l n="71">Praised as she well deserved . But I now am come hither to tell thee</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="73">“ Hesitate not , ” she , answering , said , “ to tell me what follows .</l>
     <l n="74">Thou dost not give me offence ; I have listened with gratitude to thee :</l>
     <l n="75">Speak it out honestly therefore ; the sound of it will not alarm me .</l>
     <l n="76">Thou wouldst engage me as servant to wait on thy father and mother ,</l>
     <l n="77">And to look after the welt-ordered house of which ye are the owners ;</l>
     <l n="78">And thou thinkest in me to find them a capable servant ,</l>
     <l n="79">One who is skilled in her work , and not of a rude disposition .</l>
     <l n="80">Short thy proposal has been , and short shall be also my answer .</l>
     <l n="81">Yes , I will go with thee home , and the call of fate I will follow .</l>
     <l n="82">Here my duty is done : I have brought the newly made mother</l>

     <l n="89">All the bands of the world have been loosed , and what shall unite them ,</l>

     <l n="91">If in a good man 's house I can earn my living by service ,</l>
     <l n="92">Under the eye of an excellent mistress , I gladly will do it ;</l>
     <l n="93">Since of doubtful repute , must be always a wandering maiden .</l>
     <l n="94">Yes , I will go with thee , soon as I first shall have carried the pitchers</l>

     <l n="97">Joyfully hearkened the youth to the willing maiden 's decision ,</l>
     <l n="98">Doubtful whether he ought not at once to make honest confession .</l>
     <l n="99">Yet it appeared to him best to leave her awhile in her error ,</l>
     <l n="100">Nor for her love to sue , before leading her home to his dwelling .</l>
     <l n="101">Ah ! and the golden ring he perceived on the hand of the maiden ,</l>
     <l n="102">Wherefore he let her speak on , and gave diligent ear to her language .</l>

     <l n="106">Then from their seats they rose , and both of them turned to the fountain</l>
     <l n="107">One more look behind , and a tender longing possessed them .</l>
     <l n="108">Both of the water-jars then in silence she took by the handle ,</l>

     <l n="110">One of the pitchers he begged her to give him to lighten the burden .</l>
     <l n="111">“ Nay , let it be ! ” she said : “ I carry them better so balanced .</l>
     <l n="112">Nor shall the master , who is to command , be doing me service .</l>
     <l n="113">Look not so gravely upon me , as thinking my fortune a hard one .</l>
     <l n="114">Early a woman should learn to serve , for that is her calling ;</l>
     <l n="115">Since through service alone she finally comes to the headship ,</l>
     <l n="116">Comes to the due command that is hers of right in the household .</l>
     <l n="117">Early the sister must wait on her brother , and wait on her parents ;</l>
     <l n="118">Life must be always with her a perpetual coming and going ,</l>

     <l n="120">Happy for her be she wonted to think no way is too grievous ,</l>

     <l n="122">If she find never a needle too fine , nor a labor too trifling ;</l>
     <l n="123">Wholly forgetful of self , and caring to live but in others !</l>
     <l n="124">For she will surely , as mother , have need of every virtue ,</l>
     <l n="125">When , in the time of her illness , the cries of her infant arouse her</l>
     <l n="126">Calling for food from her weakness , and cares are to suffering added .</l>
     <l n="127">Twenty men bound into one were not able to bear such a burden ;</l>
     <l n="128">Nor is it meant that they should , yet should they with gratitude view it . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="129">Thus she spoke , and was come , meanwhile , with her silent companion ,</l>
     <l n="130">Far as the floor of the barn , at the furthermost end of the garden ,</l>
     <l n="131">Where was the sick woman lying , whom , glad , she had left with her daughters ,</l>
     <l n="132">Those late rescued maidens : fair pictures of innocence were they .</l>
     <l n="133">Both of them entered the barn ; and , e'en as they did so , the justice ,</l>
     <l n="134">Leading a child in each hand , came in from the other direction .</l>
     <l n="135">These had been lost , hitherto , from the sight of their sorrowing mother ;</l>
     <l n="136">But in the midst of the crowd the old man now had descried them .</l>
     <l n="137">Joyfully sprang they forward to meet their dear mother 's embraces ,</l>
     <l n="138">And to salute with delight their brother , their unknown companion .</l>
     <l n="139">Next upon Dorothea they sprang with affectionate greeting ,</l>
     <l n="140">Asking for bread and fruit , but more than all else for some water .</l>
     <l n="141">So then she handed the water about ; and not only the children</l>
     <l n="142">Drank , but the sick woman too , and her daughters , and with them the justice .</l>
     <l n="143">All were refreshed , and highly commended the glorious water ;</l>
     <l n="144">Acid it was to the taste , and reviving , and wholesome to drink of .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="145">Then with a serious face the maiden replied to them , saying :</l>
     <l n="146">“ Friends , for the last time now to your mouth have I lifted my pitcher ;</l>
     <l n="147">And for the last time by me have your lips been moistened with water .</l>
     <l n="148">But henceforth in the heat of the day when the draught shall refresh you ,</l>
     <l n="149">When in the shade ye enjoy your rest beside a clear fountain ,</l>
     <l n="150">Think of me then sometimes and of all my affectionate service ,</l>
     <l n="151">Prompted more by my love than the duty I owed you as kindred .</l>
     <l n="152">I shall acknowledge as long as I live the kindness ye 've shown me .</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Tis with regret that I leave you ; but every one now is a burden ,</l>
     <l n="154">More than a help to his neighbor , and all must be finally scattered</l>
     <l n="155">Far through a foreign land , if return to our homes be denied us .</l>
     <l n="156">See , here stands the youth to whom we owe thanks for the presents .</l>
     <l n="157">He gave the cloak for the baby , and all these welcome provisions .</l>
     <l n="158">Now he is come , and has asked me if I will make one in his dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="159">That I may serve therein his wealthy and excellent parents .</l>
     <l n="160">And I refuse not the offer ; for maidens must always be serving ;</l>
     <l n="161">Burdensome were it for them to rest and be served in the household .</l>
     <l n="162">Therefore I follow him gladly . A youth of intelligence seems he ,</l>
     <l n="163">And so will also the parents be , as becometh the wealthy .</l>
     <l n="164">So then farewell , dear friend ; and mayst thou rejoice in thy nursling ,</l>
     <l n="165">Living , and into thy face already so healthfully looking !</l>
     <l n="166">When thou shalt press him against thy breast in these gay-colored wrappings ,</l>
     <l n="167">Oh , then remember the kindly youth who bestowed them upon us ,</l>
     <l n="168">And who me also henceforth , thy sister , will shelter and nourish .</l>
     <l n="169">Thou , too , excellent man ! ” she said as she turned to the justice ;</l>
     <l n="170">“ Take my thanks that in many a need I have found thee a father . ”</l>
     <l n="171">Then she knelt down on the floor by the side of the newly made mother ,</l>
     <l n="172">Kissing the weeping woman , and taking her low-whispered blessing .</l>
     <l n="173">Thou , meanwhile , worshipful justice , wast speaking to Hermann and saying :</l>
     <l n="174">“ Justly mayst thou , my friend , be counted among the good masters ,</l>
     <l n="175">Careful to manage their household affairs with capable servants .</l>
     <l n="176">For I have often observed how in sheep , as in horses and oxen ,</l>
     <l n="177">Men conclude never a bargain without making closest inspection ,</l>
     <l n="178">While with a servant who all things preserves , if honest and able ,</l>
     <l n="179">And who will every thing lose and destroy , if he set to work falsely ,</l>
     <l n="180">Him will a chance or an accident make us admit to our dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="181">And we are left , when too late , to repent an o'er hasty decision .</l>
     <l n="182">Thou understandest the matter it seems ; because thou hast chosen ,</l>
     <l n="183">Thee and thy parents to serve in the house , a maid who is honest .</l>
     <l n="184">Hold her with care ; for as long as thy household is under her keeping ,</l>
     <l n="185">Thou shalt not want for a sister , nor yet for a daughter thy parents . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="186">Many were come , meanwhile , near relatives all of the mother ,</l>
     <l n="187">Bringing her various gifts , and more suitable quarters announcing .</l>
     <l n="188">All of them , hearing the maiden 's decision , gave Hermann their blessing ,</l>
     <l n="189">Coupled with glances of meaning , while each made his special reflections .</l>
     <l n="190">Hastily one and another would say in the ear of his neighbor :</l>
     <l n="191">“ If in the master a lover she find , right well were she cared for . ”</l>
     <l n="192">Hermann took her at last by the hand , and said as he did so :</l>
     <l n="193">“ Let us be going ; the day is declining , and distant the city . ”</l>
     <l n="194">Eager and voluble then the women embraced Dorothea ;</l>
     <l n="195">Hermann drew her away ; but other adieus must be spoken :</l>
     <l n="196">Lastly the children with cries fell upon her and terrible weeping ,</l>
     <l n="197">Clung to her garments , and would not their dear second mother should leave them .</l>
     <l n="198">But in a tone of command the women said , one and another :</l>
     <l n="199">“ Hush now , children , she 's going to the town , and will presently bring you</l>
     <l n="200">Plenty of nice sweet cake that was by your brother bespoken</l>
     <l n="201">When by the stork just now he was brought past the shop of the baker .</l>
     <l n="202">Soon you will see her come back with sugar-plums splendidly gilded . ”</l>
     <l n="203">Then did the little ones loose their hold , and Hermann , though hardly ,</l>
     <l n="204">Tore her from further embraces away , and far-waving kerchiefs .</l>

     <l n="1">Towards the setting sun the two thus went on their journey :</l>
     <l n="2">Close he had wrapped himself round with clouds portending a tempest .</l>
     <l n="3">Out from the veil , now here and now there , with fiery flashes ,</l>
     <l n="4">Gleaming over the field shot forth the ominous lightning .</l>
     <l n="5">“ May not these threatening heavens , ” said Hermann , “ be presently sending</l>
     <l n="6">Hailstones upon us and violent rains ; for fair is the harvest . ”</l>
     <l n="7">And in the waving luxuriant grain they delighted together :</l>
     <l n="8">Almost as high it reached as the lofty shapes that moved through it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Thereupon spoke the maiden , and said to her guide and companion :</l>
     <l n="10">“ Friend , unto whom I soon am to owe so kindly a fortune ,</l>
     <l n="11">Shelter and home , while many an exile 's exposed to the tempest ,</l>
     <l n="12">Tell me concerning thy parents , I pray thee , and teach me to know them ,</l>
     <l n="13">Them whom with all my heart I desire to serve in the future .</l>
     <l n="14">Who understands his master , more easily gives satisfaction ,</l>
     <l n="15">Having regard to the things which to him seem chief in importance ,</l>
     <l n="16">And on the doing of which his firm-set mind is determined .</l>
     <l n="17">Tell me therefore , I pray , how to win thy father and mother . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">And to her question made answer the good and intelligent Hermann :</l>
     <l n="19">“ Ah , what wisdom thou showest , thou good , thou excellent maiden ,</l>
     <l n="20">Asking thus first of all concerning the tastes of my parents !</l>
     <l n="21">Know that in vain hitherto I have labored in serving my father ,</l>
     <l n="22">Taking upon me as were it my own , the charge of the household ;</l>
     <l n="23">Early and late at work in the fields , and o'erseeing the vineyard .</l>
     <l n="24">But my mother I fully content , who can value my service ;</l>
     <l n="25">And thou wilt also appear in her eyes the worthiest of maidens ,</l>
     <l n="26">If for the house thou carest , as were it thine own thou wast keeping .</l>
     <l n="27">Otherwise is it with father , who cares for the outward appearance .</l>
     <l n="28">Do not regard me , good maiden , as one who is cold and unfeeling ,</l>
     <l n="29">That unto thee a stranger I straightway discover my father .</l>
     <l n="30">Nay , I assure thee that never before have words such as these are</l>
     <l n="31">Freely dropped from my tongue , which is not accustomed to prattle ;</l>
     <l n="32">But from out of my bosom thou lurest its every secret .</l>
     <l n="33">Some of the graces of life my good father covets about him ,</l>
     <l n="34">Outward signs of affection he wishes , as well as of honor ;</l>
     <l n="35">And an inferior servant might possibly give satisfaction ,</l>
     <l n="36">Who could turn these to account , while he might be displeased with a better . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="37">Thereupon said she with joy , the while her hastening footsteps</l>
     <l n="38">Over the darkening pathway with easy motion she quickened :</l>
     <l n="39">“ Truly I hope to them both I shall equally give satisfaction :</l>
     <l n="40">For in thy mother 's nature I find such an one as mine own is ,</l>
     <l n="41">And to the outward graces I 've been from my childhood accustomed .</l>
     <l n="42">Greatly was courtesy valued among our neighbors the Frenchmen ,</l>
     <l n="43">During their earlier days ; it was common to noble and burgher ,</l>
     <l n="44">As to the peasant , and every one made it the rule of his household .</l>
     <l n="45">So , on the side of us Germans , the children were likewise accustomed</l>
     <l n="46">Daily to bring to their parents , with kissing of hands and with curtseys ,</l>
     <l n="47">Morning good-wishes , and all through the day to be prettily mannered .</l>
     <l n="48">Every thing thus that I learned , and to which I 've been used from my childhood ,</l>
     <l n="49">All that my heart shall suggest , shall be brought into play for thy father .</l>
     <l n="50">But who shall tell me of thee , and how thyself shouldst be treated ,</l>
     <l n="51">Thou the only son of the house , and henceforth my master ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="52">Thus she said , and e'en as she spoke they stood under the pear-tree .</l>
     <l n="53">Down from the heavens the moon at her full was shedding her splendor .</l>
     <l n="54">Night had come on , and wholly obscured was the last gleam of sunlight ,</l>
     <l n="55">So that contrasting masses lay side by side with each other ,</l>
     <l n="56">Clear and bright as the day , and black with the shadows of midnight ;</l>
     <l n="57">Gratefully fell upon Hermann 's ear the kindly asked question</l>
     <l n="58">Under the shade of the glorious tree , the spot he so treasured ,</l>
     <l n="59">Which but this morning had witnessed the tears he had shed for the exile .</l>
     <l n="60">And while they sat themselves down to rest them here for a little ,</l>
     <l n="61">Thus spoke the amorous youth , as he grasped the hand of the maiden :</l>
     <l n="62">“ Suffer thy heart to make answer , and follow it freely in all things . ”</l>
     <l n="63">Yet naught further he ventured to say although so propitious</l>
     <l n="64">Seemed the hour : he feared he should only haste on a refusal .</l>
     <l n="65">Ah , and he felt besides the ring on her finger , sad token !</l>
     <l n="66">Therefore they sat there , silent and still , beside one another .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="67">First was the maiden to speak : “ How sweet is this glorious moonlight ! ”</l>
     <l n="68">Said she at length : “ It is as the light of the day in its brightness .</l>
     <l n="69">There in the city I plainly can see the houses and courtyards ,</l>
     <l n="70">And in the gable — methinks I can number its panes-is a window . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="71">“ What thou seest , ” the modest youth thereupon made her answer ,—</l>
     <l n="72">“ What thou seest is our dwelling , to which I am leading thee downward ,</l>
     <l n="73">And that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic ,</l>
     <l n="74">Which will be thine perhaps , for various changes are making .</l>
     <l n="75">All these fields , too , are ours ; they are ripe for the harvest to-morrow .</l>
     <l n="76">Here in the shade we will rest , and partake of our noontide refreshment .</l>
     <l n="77">But it is time we began our descent through the vineyard and garden ;</l>
     <l n="78">For dost thou mark how yon threatening storm-cloud comes nearer and nearer ,</l>
     <l n="79">Charged with lightning , and ready our fair full moon to extinguish ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="80">So they arose from their seats , and over the cornfields descended ,</l>
     <l n="81">Through the luxuriant grain , enjoying the brightness of evening ,</l>
     <l n="82">Until they came to the vineyard , and so entered into its shadow .</l>
     <l n="83">Then he guided her down o'er the numerous blocks that were lying ,</l>
     <l n="84">Rough and unhewn on the pathway , and served as the steps of the alley .</l>
     <l n="85">Slowly the maiden descended , and leaning her hands on his shoulder ,</l>
     <l n="86">While with uncertain beams , the moon through the leaves overlooked them ,</l>
     <l n="87">Ere she was veiled by the cloud , and so left the couple in darkness .</l>
     <l n="88">Carefully Hermann 's strength supported the maid that hung o'er him ;</l>
     <l n="89">But , not knowing the path and the rough-hewn steps that led down it ,</l>
     <l n="90">Missed she her footing , her ankle turned , and she surely had fallen ,</l>
     <l n="91">Had not the dexterous youth his arm outstretched in an instant ,</l>
     <l n="92">And his beloved upheld . She gently sank on his shoulder ;</l>
     <l n="93">Breast was pressed against breast , and cheek against cheek . Thus he stood there</l>
     <l n="94">Fixed as a marble statue , the force of will keeping him steadfast ,</l>

     <l n="96">Thus he the glorious burden felt , the warmth of her bosom ,</l>
     <l n="97">And the perfume of her breath , that over his lips was exhaling ;</l>
     <l n="98">Bore with the heart of a man the majestic form of the woman .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="99">But she with playfulness said , concealing the pain that she suffered :</l>
     <l n="100">“ That is a sign of misfortune , so timorous persons would tell us ,</l>

     <l n="1">Muses , O ye who the course of true love so willingly favor ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ye who thus far on his way the excellent youth have conducted ,</l>
     <l n="3">Even before the betrothal have pressed to his bosom the maiden ;</l>
     <l n="4">Further your aid vouchsafe this charming pair in uniting ,</l>
     <l n="5">Straightway dispersing the clouds which over their happiness lower !</l>
     <l n="6">Yet first of all declare what is passing meanwhile at the Lion .</l>

     <l n="7">Now for the third time again the mother impatient had entered</l>
     <l n="8">Where were assembled the men , whom anxious but now she had quitted ;</l>
     <l n="9">Spoke of the gathering storm , and the moonlight 's rapid obscuring ;</l>
     <l n="10">Then of her son 's late tarrying abroad and the dangers of nightfall ;</l>
     <l n="11">Sharply upbraided her friends that without having speech of the maiden ,</l>
     <l n="12">And without urging his suit , they had parted from Hermann so early .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">“ Make it not worse than it is , ” the father replied with displeasure .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="15">Calmly , however , from where he was sitting the neighbor made answer :</l>
     <l n="16">“ Never in hours of disquiet like this do I fail to be grateful</l>
     <l n="17">Unto my late , blessed father , who every root of impatience</l>
     <l n="18">Tore from my heart when a child , and left no fibre remaining ;</l>
     <l n="19">So that I learned on the instant to wait as do none of your sages . ”</l>

     <l n="20">“ Tell us , ” the pastor returned , “ what legerdemain he made use of . ”</l>
     <l n="21">“ That will I gladly relate , for all may draw from it a lesson ; ”</l>
     <l n="22">So made the neighbor reply . “ When a boy I once stood of a Sunday</l>
     <l n="23">Full of impatience , and looking with eagerness out for the carriage</l>
     <l n="24">Which was to carry us forth to the spring that lies under the lindens .</l>
     <l n="25">Still the coach came not . I ran , like a weasel , now hither , now thither ,</l>
     <l n="26">Up stairs and down , and forward and back , ‘ twixt the door and the window ;</l>
     <l n="27">Even my fingers itched to be moving ; I scratched on the tables ,</l>
     <l n="28">Went about pounding and stamping , and hardly could keep me from weeping .</l>
     <l n="29">All was observed by the calm-tempered man ; but at last when my folly</l>
     <l n="30">Came to be carried too far , by the arm he quietly took me ,</l>
     <l n="31">Led me away to the window , and spoke in this serious language :</l>
     <l n="32">‘ Seest thou yonder the carpenter 's shop that is closed for the Sunday ?</l>
     <l n="33">He will re-open to-morrow , when plane and saw will be started ,</l>
     <l n="34">And will keep on through the hours of labor from morning till evening .</l>
     <l n="35">But consider you this ,— a day will be presently coming</l>
     <l n="36">When that man shall himself be astir and all of his workmen ,</l>
     <l n="37">Making a coffin for thee to be quickly and skilfully finished .</l>
     <l n="38">Then that house of boards they will busily bring over hither ,</l>
     <l n="39">Which must at last receive alike the impatient and patient ,</l>
     <l n="40">And which is destined soon with close-pressing roof to be covered . ’</l>
     <l n="41">Straightway I saw the whole thing in my mind as if it were doing ;</l>
     <l n="42">Saw the boards fitting together , and saw the black color preparing ,</l>
     <l n="43">Sat me down patiently then , and in quiet awaited the carriage .</l>
     <l n="44">Now when others I see , in seasons of anxious expectance ,</l>
     <l n="45">Running distracted about , I cannot but think of the coffin . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="46">Smiling , the pastor replied : “ The affecting picture of death stands</l>
     <l n="47">Not as a dread to the wise , and not as an end to the pious .</l>
     <l n="48">Those it presses again into life , and teaches to use it ;</l>
     <l n="49">These by affliction it strengthens in hope to future salvation .</l>
     <l n="50">Death becomes life unto both . Thy father was greatly mistaken</l>
     <l n="51">When to a sensitive boy he death in death thus depicted .</l>
     <l n="52">Let us the value of nobly ripe age , point out to the young man ,</l>
     <l n="53">And to the aged the youth , that in the eternal progression</l>
     <l n="54">Both may rejoice , and life may in life thus find its completion . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="55">But the door was now opened , and showed the majestical couple .</l>
     <l n="56">Filled with amaze were the friends , and amazed the affectionate parents ,</l>
     <l n="57">Seeing the form of the maid so well matched with that of her lover .</l>
     <l n="58">Yea , the door seemed too low to allow the tall figures to enter ,</l>
     <l n="59">As they together now appeared coming over the threshold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="60">Hermann , with hurried words , presented her thus to his parents :</l>
     <l n="61">“ Here is a maiden , ” he said ; “ such a one as ye wish in the household .</l>
     <l n="62">Kindly receive her , dear father : she merits it well ; and thou , mother ,</l>
     <l n="63">Question her straightway on all that belongs to a housekeeper 's duty ,</l>
     <l n="64">That ye may see how well she deserves to ye both to be nearer . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="65">Quickly he then drew aside the excellent clergyman , saying :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Help me , O worthy sir , and speedily out of this trouble ;</l>
     <l n="67">Loosen , I pray thee , this knot , at whose untying I tremble .</l>
     <l n="68">Know that ‘ tis not as a lover that I have brought hither the maiden ;</l>
     <l n="69">But she believes that as servant she comes to the house , and I tremble</l>
     <l n="70">Lest in displeasure she fly as soon as there 's mention of marriage .</l>
     <l n="71">But be it straightway decided ; for she no longer in error</l>
     <l n="72">Thus shall be left , and I this suspense no longer can suffer .</l>
     <l n="73">Hasten and show us in this a proof of the wisdom we honor . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="74">Towards the company then the clergyman instantly turned him ;</l>
     <l n="75">But already , alas ! had the soul of the maiden been troubled ,</l>
     <l n="76">Hearing the father 's speech ; for he , in his sociable fashion ,</l>
     <l n="77">Had in these playful words , with the kindest intention addressed her :</l>
     <l n="78">“ Ay , this is well , my child ! with delight I perceive that my Hermann</l>
     <l n="79">Has the good taste of his father , who often showed his in his young days ,</l>
     <l n="80">Leading out always the fairest to dance , and bringing the fairest</l>
     <l n="81">Finally home as his wife ; our dear little mother here that was .</l>
     <l n="82">For by the bride that a man shall elect we can judge what himself is ,</l>
     <l n="83">Tell what the spirit is in him , and whether he feel his own value .</l>
     <l n="84">Nor didst thou need for thyself , I 'll engage , much time for decision ;</l>
     <l n="85">For , in good sooth , methinks , he 's no difficult person to follow . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="86">Hermann had heard but in part ; his limbs were inwardly trembling ,</l>
     <l n="87">And of a sudden a stillness had fallen on all of the circle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="88">But by these words of derision , for such she could not but deem them ,</l>
     <l n="89">Wounded , and stung to the depths of her soul , the excellent maiden ,</l>
     <l n="90">Stood , while the fugitive blood o'er her cheeks and e'en to her bosom ,</l>
     <l n="91">Poured its flush . But she governed herself , and her courage collecting ,</l>
     <l n="92">Answered the old man thus , her pain not wholly concealing :</l>
     <l n="93">“ Truly for such a reception thy son had in no wise prepared me ,</l>
     <l n="94">When he the ways of his father described , the excellent burgher .</l>
     <l n="95">Thou art a man of culture , I know , before whom I am standing ;</l>
     <l n="96">Dealest with every one wisely , according as suits his position ;</l>
     <l n="97">But thou hast scanty compassion , it seems , on one such as I am ,</l>
     <l n="98">Who , a poor girl , am now crossing thy threshold with purpose to serve thee ;</l>
     <l n="99">Else , with such bitter derision , thou wouldst not have made me remember</l>
     <l n="100">How far removed my fortune from that of thyself and thy son is .</l>
     <l n="101">True , I come poor to thy house , and bring with me naught but my bundle</l>
     <l n="102">Here where is every abundance to gladden the prosperous inmates .</l>
     <l n="103">Yet I know well myself ; I feel the relations between us ,</l>
     <l n="104">Say , is it noble , with so much of mockery straightway to greet me ,</l>
     <l n="105">That I am sent from the house while my foot is scarce yet on the threshold ? ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="106">Anxiously Hermann turned and signed to his ally the pastor</l>
     <l n="107">That he should rush to the rescue and straightway dispel the delusion .</l>
     <l n="108">Then stepped the wise man hastily forward and looked on the maiden 's</l>
     <l n="109">Tearful eyes , her silent pain and repressed indignation ,</l>
     <l n="110">And in his heart was impelled not at once to clear up the confusion ,</l>
     <l n="111">Rather to put to the test the girl 's disquieted spirit .</l>
     <l n="112">Therefore he unto her said in language intended to try her :</l>
     <l n="113">“ Surely , thou foreign-born maiden , thou didst not maturely consider ,</l>
     <l n="114">When thou too rashly decidedst to enter the service of strangers ,</l>
     <l n="115">All that is meant by the placing thyself ‘ neath the rule of a master ;</l>
     <l n="116">For by our hand to a bargain the fate of the year is determined ,</l>
     <l n="117">And but a single ‘ yea ’ compels to much patient endurance .</l>
     <l n="118">Not the worst part of the service the wearisome steps to be taken ,</l>
     <l n="119">Neither the bitter sweat of a labor that presses unceasing ;</l>
     <l n="120">Since the industrious freeman must toil as well as the servant .</l>
     <l n="121">But ‘ tis to bear with the master 's caprice when he censures unjustly ,</l>
     <l n="122">Or when , at variance with self , he orders now this , now the other ;</l>
     <l n="123">Bear with the petulance , too , of the mistress , easily angered ,</l>
     <l n="124">And with the rude , overbearing ways of unmannerly children .</l>
     <l n="125">All this is hard to endure , and yet to go on with thy duties</l>
     <l n="126">Quickly , without delay , nor thyself grow sullen and stubborn .</l>
     <l n="127">Yet thou appearest ill fitted for this , since already so deeply</l>
     <l n="128">Stung by the father 's jests : whereas there is nothing more common</l>
     <l n="129">Than for a girl to be teased on account of a youth she may fancy . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="130">Thus he spoke . The maiden had felt the full force of his language ,</l>
     <l n="131">And she restrained her no more ; but with passionate outburst her feelings</l>
     <l n="132">Made themselves way ; a sob broke forth from her now heaving bosom ,</l>
     <l n="133">And , while the scalding tears poured down , she straightway made answer :</l>
     <l n="134">“ Ah , that rational man who thinks to advise us in sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="135">Knows not how little of power his cold words have in relieving</l>
     <l n="136">Ever a heart from that woe which a sovereign fate has inflicted .</l>
     <l n="137">Ye are prosperous and glad ; how then should a pleasantry wound you ?</l>
     <l n="138">Yet but the lightest touch is a source of pain to the sick man .</l>
     <l n="139">Nay , concealment itself , if successful , had profited nothing .</l>
     <l n="140">Better show now what had later increased to a bitterer anguish ,</l>
     <l n="141">And to an inward consuming despair might perhaps have reduced me .</l>
     <l n="142">Let me go back ! for here in this house I can tarry no longer .</l>
     <l n="143">I will away , and wander in search of my hapless companions ,</l>
     <l n="144">Whom I forsook in their need ; for myself alone choosing the better .</l>
     <l n="145">This is my firm resolve , and I therefore may make a confession</l>
     <l n="146">Which might for years perhaps have else lain hid in my bosom .</l>
     <l n="147">Deeply indeed was I hurt by the father 's words of derision ;</l>
     <l n="148">Not that I 'm sensitive , proud beyond what is fitting a servant ;</l>
     <l n="149">But that my heart in truth had felt itself stirred with affection</l>
     <l n="150">Towards the youth who to-day had appeared to my eyes as a savior .</l>
     <l n="151">When he first left me there on the road , he still remained present ,</l>
     <l n="152">Haunting my every thought ; I fancied the fortunate maiden</l>
     <l n="153">Whom as a bride , perhaps , his heart had already elected .</l>
     <l n="154">When at the fountain I met him again , the sight of him wakened</l>
     <l n="155">Pleasure as great as if there had met me an angel from heaven ;</l>
     <l n="156">And with what gladness I followed , when asked to come as his servant .</l>
     <l n="157">True , that I flattered myself in my heart ,— I will not deny it ,—</l>
     <l n="158">While we were hitherward coming , I might peradventure deserve him ,</l>
     <l n="159">Should I become at last the important stay of the household .</l>
     <l n="160">Now I , alas ! for the first time see what risk I was running ,</l>
     <l n="161">When I would make my home so near to the secretly loved one ;</l>
     <l n="162">Now for the first time feel how far removed a poor maiden</l>
     <l n="163">Is from an opulent youth , no matter how great her deserving .</l>
     <l n="164">All this I now confess , that my heart ye may not misinterpret ,</l>
     <l n="165">In that ‘ twas hurt by a chance to which I owe my awaking .</l>
     <l n="166">Hiding my secret desires , this dread had been ever before me ,</l>
     <l n="167">That at some early day he would bring him a bride to his dwelling ;</l>
     <l n="168">And ah , how could I then my inward anguish have suffered !</l>
     <l n="169">Happily I have been warned , and happily now has my bosom</l>
     <l n="170">Been of its secret relieved , while yet there is cure for the evil .</l>
     <l n="171">But no more ; I have spoken ; and now shall nothing detain me</l>
     <l n="172">Longer here in a house where I stay but in shame and confusion ,</l>
     <l n="173">Freely confessing my love and that foolish hope that I cherished .</l>
     <l n="174">Not the night which abroad is covered with lowering storm clouds ;</l>
     <l n="175">Not the roll of the thunder — I hear its peal — shall deter me ;</l>
     <l n="176">Not the pelt of the rain which without is beating in fury ;</l>
     <l n="177">Neither the blustering tempest ; for all these things have I suffered</l>
     <l n="178">During our sorrowful flight , and while the near foe was pursuing .</l>
     <l n="179">Now I again go forth , as I have so long been accustomed ,</l>
     <l n="180">Carried away by the whirl of the times , and from every thing parted .</l>
     <l n="181">Fare ye well ! I tarry no longer ; all now is over . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="182">Thus she spoke and back to the door she hastily turned her ,</l>
     <l n="183">Still bearing under her arm , as she with her had brought it , her bundle .</l>
     <l n="184">But with both of her arms the mother seized hold of the maiden ,</l>
     <l n="185">Clasping her round the waist , and exclaiming , amazed and bewildered :</l>

     <l n="193">Violent outcries , which only involve in disorder and passion ,</l>
     <l n="194">What with a little of sense had been more smoothly adjusted .</l>
     <l n="195">Settle the thing for yourselves : I 'm going to bed ; I 've no patience</l>
     <l n="196">Longer to be a spectator of these your marvellous doings . ”</l>
     <l n="197">Quickly he turned as he spoke , and hastened to go to the chamber</l>
     <l n="198">Where he was wonted to rest , and his marriage bed was kept standing ,</l>
     <l n="199">But he was held by his son , who said in a tone of entreaty :</l>
     <l n="200">“ Father , hasten not from us , and be thou not wroth with the maiden .</l>
     <l n="201">I , only I , am to blame as the cause of all this confusion ,</l>

     <l n="203">Speak , O worthy sir ; for to thee my cause I intrusted .</l>
     <l n="204">Heap not up sorrow and anger , but rather let all this be ended ;</l>
     <l n="205">For I could hold thee never again in such high estimation ,</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="207">Thereupon answered and said the excellent clergyman , smiling :</l>
     <l n="208">“ Tell me , what other device could have drawn this charming confession</l>
     <l n="209">Out of the good maiden 's lips , and thus have revealed her affection ?</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="212">Thereupon Hermann came forward , and spoke in these words of affection :</l>

     <l n="215">Not to engage the stranger , the excellent maid , as a servant ,</l>
     <l n="216">Unto the fountain I came ; but to sue for thy love I came thither .</l>
     <l n="217">Only , alas ! my timorous look could thy heart 's inclination</l>
     <l n="218">Nowise perceive ; I read in thine eyes of nothing but kindness ,</l>
     <l n="219">As from the fountain 's tranquil mirror thou gavest me greeting .</l>
     <l n="220">Might I but bring thee home , the half of my joy was accomplished .</l>
     <l n="221">But thou completest it unto me now ; oh , blest be thou for it ! ”</l>
     <l n="222">Then with a deep emotion the maiden gazed on the stripling ;</l>
     <l n="223">Neither forbade she embrace and kiss , the summit of rapture ,</l>
     <l n="224">When to a loving pair they come as the longed-for assurance ,</l>
     <l n="225">Pledge of a lifetime of bliss , that appears to them now never-ending .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="19">
     <l n="226">Unto the others , meanwhile , the pastor had made explanation .</l>

     <l n="228">Bent her before him , and kissing the hand he would fain have withholden ,</l>
     <l n="229">Said : “ Thou wilt surely be just and forgive one so startled as I was ,</l>

     <l n="232">For I can scarce comprehend the happiness newly vouchsafed me .</l>
     <l n="233">Yes , let that first vexation of which I , bewildered , was guilty</l>
     <l n="234">Be too the last . Whatever the maid of affectionate service</l>
     <l n="235">Faithfully promised , shall be to thee now performed by the daughter . ”</l>
     <l n="236">Straightway then , concealing his tears , the father embraced her ,</l>
     <l n="237">Cordially , too , the mother came forward and kissed her with fervor ,</l>
     <l n="238">Pressing her hands in her own : the weeping women were silent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="20">
     <l n="239">Thereupon quickly he seized , the good and intelligent pastor ,</l>
     <l n="240">First the father 's hand , and the wedding-ring drew from his finger ,—</l>
     <l n="241">Not so easily either : the finger was plump and detained it ,—</l>
     <l n="242">Next took the mother 's ring also , and with them betrothed he the children ,</l>
     <l n="243">Saying : “ These golden circlets once more their office performing</l>
     <l n="244">Firmly a tie shall unite , which in all things shall equal the old one ,</l>
     <l n="245">Deeply is this young man imbued with love of the maiden ,</l>
     <l n="246">And , as the maiden confesses , her heart is gone out to him also .</l>
     <l n="247">Here do I therefore betroth you and bless for the years that are coming ,</l>
     <l n="248">With the consent of the parents , and having this friend as a witness . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="21">
     <l n="249">Then the neighbor saluted at once , and expressed his good wishes ;</l>
     <l n="250">But when the clergyman now the golden circlet was drawing</l>
     <l n="251">Over the maiden 's hand , he observed with amazement the other ,</l>
     <l n="252">Which had already by Hermann been anxiously marked at the fountain .</l>
     <l n="253">And with a kindly raillery thus thereupon he addressed her :</l>
     <l n="254">“ So , then thy second betrothal is this ? let us hope the first bridegroom</l>
     <l n="255">May not appear at the altar , and so prohibit the marriage . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="22">
     <l n="256">But she , answering , said : “ Oh , let me to this recollection</l>
     <l n="257">Yet one moment devote ; for so much is due the good giver ,</l>
     <l n="258">Him who bestowed it at parting , and never came back to his kindred .</l>
     <l n="259">All that should come he foresaw , when in haste the passion for freedom ,</l>
     <l n="260">When a desire in the newly changed order of things to be working ,</l>
     <l n="261">Urged him onward to Paris , where chains and death he encountered .</l>
     <l n="262">‘ Fare thee well , ’ were his words ; ‘ I go , for all is in motion</l>
     <l n="263">Now for a time on the earth , and every thing seems to be parting .</l>
     <l n="264">E'en in the firmest states fundamental laws are dissolving ;</l>
     <l n="265">Property falls away from the hand of the ancient possessor ;</l>
     <l n="266">Friend is parted from friend ; and so parts lover from lover .</l>
     <l n="267">Here I leave thee , and where I shall find thee again , or if ever ,</l>
     <l n="268">Who can tell ? Perhaps these words are our last ones together .</l>
     <l n="269">Man 's but a stranger here on the earth , we are told and with reason ;</l>
     <l n="270">And we are each of us now become more of strangers than ever .</l>
     <l n="271">Ours no more is the soil , and our treasures are all of them changing :</l>
     <l n="272">Silver and gold are melting away from their time-honored patterns .</l>
     <l n="273">All is in motion as though the already-shaped world into chaos</l>
     <l n="274">Meant to resolve itself backward into night , and to shape itself over .</l>
     <l n="275">Mine thou wilt keep thine heart , and should we be ever united</l>
     <l n="276">Over the ruins of earth , it will be as newly made creatures ,</l>
     <l n="277">Beings transformed and free , no longer dependent on fortune ;</l>
     <l n="278">For can aught fetter the man who has lived through days such as these are !</l>
     <l n="279">But if it is not to be , that , these dangers happily over ,</l>
     <l n="280">Ever again we be granted the bliss of mutual embraces ,</l>
     <l n="281">Oh , then before thy thoughts so keep my hovering image</l>
     <l n="282">That with unshaken mind thou be ready for good or for evil !</l>
     <l n="283">Should new ties allure thee again , and a new habitation ,</l>
     <l n="284">Enter with gratitude into the joys that fate shall prepare thee ;</l>
     <l n="285">Love those purely who love thee ; be grateful to them who show kindness .</l>
     <l n="286">But thine uncertain foot should yet be planted but lightly ,</l>
     <l n="287">For there is lurking the twofold pain of a new separation .</l>
     <l n="288">Blessings attend thy life ; but value existence no higher</l>
     <l n="289">Than thine other possessions , and all possessions are cheating ! ’</l>
     <l n="290">Thus spoke the noble youth , and never again I beheld him .</l>
     <l n="291">Meanwhile I lost my all , and a thousand times thought of his warning .</l>
     <l n="292">Here , too , I think of his words , when love is sweetly preparing</l>
     <l n="293">Happiness for me anew , and glorious hopes are reviving ,</l>
     <l n="294">Oh forgive me , excellent friend , that e'en while I hold thee</l>
     <l n="295">Close to my side I tremble ! So unto the late-landed sailor</l>
     <l n="296">Seem the most solid foundations of firmest earth to be rocking . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="23">
     <l n="297">Thus she spoke , and placed the two rings on her finger together .</l>
     <l n="298">But her lover replied with a noble and manly emotion :</l>
     <l n="299">“ So much the firmer then , amid these universal convulsions ,</l>
     <l n="300">Be , Dorothea , our union ! We two will hold fast and continue ,</l>
     <l n="301">Firmly maintaining ourselves , and the right to our ample possessions .</l>
     <l n="302">For that man , who , when times are uncertain , is faltering in spirit ,</l>
     <l n="303">Only increases the evil , and further and further transmits it ;</l>
     <l n="304">While he refashions the world , who keeps himself steadfastly minded .</l>
     <l n="305">Poorly becomes it the German to give to these fearful excitements</l>
     <l n="306">Aught of continuance , or to be this way and that way inclining .</l>
     <l n="307">This is our own ! let that be our word , and let us maintain it !</l>
     <l n="308">For to those resolute peoples respect will be ever accorded ,</l>
     <l n="309">Who for God and the laws , for parents , women and children ,</l>
     <l n="310">Fought and died , as together they stood with their front to the foeman .</l>
     <l n="311">Thou art mine own ; and now what is mine , is mine more than ever .</l>
     <l n="312">Not with anxiety will I preserve it , and trembling enjoyment ;</l>
     <l n="313">Rather with courage and strength . To-day should the enemy threaten ,</l>
     <l n="314">Or in the future , equip me thyself and hand me my weapons .</l>
     <l n="315">Let me but know that under thy care are my house and dear parents ,</l>
     <l n="316">Oh ! I can then with assurance expose my breast to the foeman .</l>
     <l n="317">And were but every man minded like me , there would be an upspring</l>
     <l n="318">Might against might , and peace should revisit us all with its gladness . ”</l>
