     <p>“ What more felicity can fall to creature , Than to enjoy delight with liberty . ” Fate of the Butterfly .— SPENSER . DEDICATION .</p>
    </epigraph>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO LEIGH HUNT , ESQ . Glory and loveliness have passed away ; For if we wander out in early morn , No wreathed incense do we see upborne Into the east , to meet the smiling day : No crowd of nymphs soft voic 'd and young , and gay , In woven baskets bringing ears of corn , Roses , and pinks , and violets , to adorn The shrine of Flora in her early May . But there are left delights as high as these , And I shall ever bless my destiny , That in a time , when under pleasant trees Pan is no longer sought , I feel a free A leafy luxury , seeing I could please With these poor offerings , a man like thee . [ The Short Pieces in the middle of the Book , as well as some of the Sonnets , were written at an earlier period than the rest of the Poems . ]</p>

   <p>“ Places of nestling green for Poets made . ” STORY OF RIMINI .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">I stood tip-toe upon a little hill ,</l>
     <l n="2">The air was cooling , and so very still .</l>
     <l n="3">That the sweet buds which with a modest pride</l>
     <l n="4">Pull droopingly , in slanting curve aside ,</l>
     <l n="5">Their scantly leaved , and finely tapering stems ,</l>
     <l n="6">Had not yet lost those starry diadems</l>
     <l n="7">Caught from the early sobbing of the morn .</l>
     <l n="8">The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn ,</l>
     <l n="9">And fresh from the clear brook ; sweetly they slept</l>
     <l n="10">On the blue fields of heaven , and then there crept</l>
     <l n="11">A little noiseless noise among the leaves ,</l>
     <l n="12">Born of the very sigh that silence heaves :</l>
     <l n="13">For not the faintest motion could be seen</l>
     <l n="14">Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green .</l>
     <l n="15">There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye ,</l>
     <l n="16">To peer about upon variety ;</l>
     <l n="17">Far round the horizon 's crystal air to skim ,</l>
     <l n="18">And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim ;</l>
     <l n="19">To picture out the quaint , and curious bending</l>
     <l n="20">Of a fresh woodland alley , never ending ;</l>
     <l n="21">Or by the bowery clefts , and leafy shelves ,</l>
     <l n="22">Guess were the jaunty streams refresh themselves .</l>
     <l n="23">I gazed awhile , and felt as light , and free</l>
     <l n="24">As though the fanning wings of Mercury</l>
     <l n="25">Had played upon my heels : I was light-hearted ,</l>
     <l n="26">And many pleasures to my vision started ;</l>
     <l n="27">So I straightway began to pluck a posey</l>
     <l n="28">Of luxuries bright , milky , soft and rosy .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="29">A bush of May flowers with the bees about them ;</l>
     <l n="30">Ah , sure no tasteful nook would be without them ;</l>
     <l n="31">And let a lush laburnum oversweep them ,</l>
     <l n="32">And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them</l>
     <l n="33">Moist , cool and green ; and shade the violets ,</l>
     <l n="34">That they may bind the moss in leafy nets .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="35">A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined ,</l>
     <l n="36">And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind</l>
     <l n="37">Upon their summer thrones ; there too should be</l>
     <l n="38">The frequent chequer of a youngling tree ,</l>
     <l n="39">That with a score of light green brethen shoots</l>
     <l n="40">From the quaint mossiness of aged roots :</l>
     <l n="41">Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters</l>
     <l n="42">Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters</l>
     <l n="43">The spreading blue bells : it may haply mourn</l>
     <l n="44">That such fair clusters should be rudely torn</l>
     <l n="45">From their fresh beds , and scattered thoughtlessly</l>
     <l n="46">By infant hands , left on the path to die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">Open afresh your round of starry folds ,</l>
     <l n="48">Ye ardent marigolds !</l>
     <l n="49">Dry up the moisture from your golden lids ,</l>
     <l n="50">For great Apollo bids</l>
     <l n="51">That in these days your praises should be sung</l>
     <l n="52">On many harps , which he has lately strung ;</l>
     <l n="53">And when again your dewiness he kisses ,</l>
     <l n="54">Tell him , I have you in my world of blisses :</l>
     <l n="55">So haply when I rove in some far vale ,</l>
     <l n="56">His mighty voice may come upon the gale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="57">Here are sweet peas , on tip-toe for a flight :</l>
     <l n="58">With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white ,</l>
     <l n="59">And taper fulgent catching at all things ,</l>
     <l n="60">To bind them all about with tiny rings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="61">Linger awhile upon some bending planks</l>
     <l n="62">That lean against a streamlet 's rushy banks ,</l>
     <l n="63">And watch intently Nature 's gentle doings :</l>
     <l n="64">They will be found softer than ring-dove 's cooings .</l>
     <l n="65">How silent comes the water round that bend ;</l>
     <l n="66">Not the minutest whisper does it send</l>
     <l n="67">To the o'erhanging sallows : blades of grass</l>
     <l n="68">Slowly across the chequer 'd shadows pass .</l>
     <l n="69">Why , you might read two sonnets , ere they reach</l>
     <l n="70">To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach</l>
     <l n="71">A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds ;</l>
     <l n="72">Where swarms of minnows show their little heads ,</l>
     <l n="73">Staying their wavy bodies ‘ gainst the streams ,</l>
     <l n="74">To taste the luxury of sunny beams</l>
     <l n="75">Temper 'd with coolness . How they ever wrestle</l>
     <l n="76">With their own sweet delight , and ever nestle</l>
     <l n="77">Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand .</l>
     <l n="78">If you but scantily hold out the hand ,</l>
     <l n="79">That very instant not one will remain ;</l>
     <l n="80">But turn your eye , and they are there again .</l>
     <l n="81">The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses ,</l>
     <l n="82">And cool themselves among the em'rald tresses ;</l>
     <l n="83">The while they cool themselves , they freshness give ,</l>
     <l n="84">And moisture , that the bowery green may live :</l>
     <l n="85">So keeping up an interchange of favours ,</l>
     <l n="86">Like good men in the truth of their behaviours</l>
     <l n="87">Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop</l>
     <l n="88">From low hung branches ; little space they stop ;</l>
     <l n="89">But sip , and twitter , and their feathers sleek ;</l>
     <l n="90">Then off at once , as in a wanton freak :</l>
     <l n="91">Or perhaps , to show their black , and golden wings ,</l>
     <l n="92">Pausing upon their yellow flutterings .</l>
     <l n="93">Were I in such a place , I sure should pray</l>
     <l n="94">That nought less sweet , might call my thoughts away ,</l>
     <l n="95">Than the soft rustle of a maiden 's gown</l>
     <l n="96">Fanning away the dandelion 's down ;</l>
     <l n="97">Than the light music of her nimble toes</l>
     <l n="98">Patting against the sorrel as she goes .</l>
     <l n="99">How she would start , and blush , thus to be caught</l>
     <l n="100">Playing in all her innocence of thought .</l>
     <l n="101">O let me lead her gently o'er the brook ,</l>
     <l n="102">Watch her half-smiling lips , and downward look ;</l>
     <l n="103">O let me for one moment touch her wrist ;</l>
     <l n="104">Let me one moment to her breathing list ;</l>
     <l n="105">And as she leaves me may she often turn</l>
     <l n="106">Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne .</l>
     <l n="107">What next ? A tuft of evening primroses ,</l>
     <l n="108">O'er which the mind may hover till it dozes ;</l>
     <l n="109">O'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep ,</l>
     <l n="110">But that ‘ tis ever startled by the leap</l>
     <l n="111">Of buds into ripe flowers ; or by the flitting</l>
     <l n="112">Of diverse moths , that aye their rest are quitting ;</l>
     <l n="113">Or by the moon lifting her silver rim</l>
     <l n="114">Above a cloud , and with a gradual swim</l>
     <l n="115">Coming into the blue with all her light .</l>
     <l n="116">O Maker of sweet poets , dear delight</l>
     <l n="117">Of this fair world , and all its gentle livers ;</l>
     <l n="118">Spangler of clouds , halo of crystal rivers ,</l>
     <l n="119">Mingler with leaves , and dew and tumbling streams ,</l>
     <l n="120">Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams ,</l>
     <l n="121">Lover of loneliness , and wandering ,</l>
     <l n="122">Of upcast eye , and tender pondering !</l>
     <l n="123">Thee must I praise above all other glories</l>
     <l n="124">That smile us on to tell delightful stories .</l>
     <l n="125">For what has made the sage or poet write</l>
     <l n="126">But the fair paradise of Nature 's light ?</l>
     <l n="127">In the calm grandeur of a sober line ,</l>
     <l n="128">We see the waving of the mountain pine ;</l>
     <l n="129">And when a tale is beautifully staid ,</l>
     <l n="130">We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade :</l>
     <l n="131">When it is moving on luxurious wings ,</l>
     <l n="132">The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings :</l>
     <l n="133">Fair dewy roses brush against our faces ,</l>
     <l n="134">And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases ;</l>
     <l n="135">O'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar ,</l>
     <l n="136">And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire ;</l>
     <l n="137">While at our feet , the voice of crystal bubbles</l>
     <l n="138">Charms us at once away from all our troubles :</l>
     <l n="139">So that we feel uplifted from the world ,</l>
     <l n="140">Walking upon the white clouds wreath 'd and curl 'd .</l>
     <l n="141">So felt he , who first told , how Psyche went</l>
     <l n="142">On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment ;</l>
     <l n="143">What Psyche felt , and Love , when their full lips</l>
     <l n="144">First touch 'd ; what amorous , and fondling nips</l>
     <l n="145">They gave each other 's cheeks ; with all their sighs ,</l>
     <l n="146">And how they kist each other 's tremulous eyes :</l>
     <l n="147">The silver lamp ,— the ravishment ,— the wonder —</l>
     <l n="148">The darkness ,— loneliness ,— the fearful thunder ;</l>
     <l n="149">Their woes gone by , and both to heaven upflown ,</l>
     <l n="150">To bow for gratitude before Jove 's throne .</l>
     <l n="151">So did he feel , who pull 'd the boughs aside ,</l>
     <l n="152">That we might look into a forest wide ,</l>
     <l n="153">To catch a glimpse of Fawns , and Dryades</l>
     <l n="154">Coming with softest rustle through the trees ;</l>
     <l n="155">And garlands woven of flowers wild , and sweet ,</l>
     <l n="156">Upheld on ivory wrists , or sporting feet :</l>
     <l n="157">Telling us how fair , trembling Syrinx fled</l>
     <l n="158">Arcadian Pan , with such a fearful dread .</l>
     <l n="159">Poor nymph ,— poor Pan ,— how he did weep to find ,</l>
     <l n="160">Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind</l>
     <l n="161">Along the reedy stream ; a half heard strain ,</l>
     <l n="162">Full of sweet desolation — balmy pain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="163">What first inspired a bard of old to sing</l>
     <l n="164">Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring ?</l>
     <l n="165">In some delicious ramble , he had found</l>
     <l n="166">A little space , with boughs all woven round ;</l>
     <l n="167">And in the midst of all , a clearer pool</l>
     <l n="168">Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool ,</l>
     <l n="169">The blue sky here , and there , serenely peeping</l>
     <l n="170">Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping .</l>
     <l n="171">And on the bank a lonely flower he spied ,</l>
     <l n="172">A meek and forlorn flower , with naught of pride ,</l>
     <l n="173">Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness ,</l>
     <l n="174">To woo its own sad image into nearness :</l>
     <l n="175">Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move ;</l>
     <l n="176">But still would seem to droop , to pine , to love .</l>
     <l n="177">So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot ,</l>
     <l n="178">Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot ;</l>
     <l n="179">Nor was it long ere he had told the tale</l>
     <l n="180">Of young Narcissus , and sad Echo 's bale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="181">Where had he been , from whose warm head out-flew</l>
     <l n="182">That sweetest of all songs , that ever new ,</l>
     <l n="183">That aye refreshing , pure deliciousness ,</l>
     <l n="184">Coming ever to bless</l>
     <l n="185">The wanderer by moonlight ? to him bringing</l>
     <l n="186">Shapes from the invisible world , unearthly singing</l>
     <l n="187">From out the middle air , from flowery nests ,</l>
     <l n="188">And from the pillowy silkiness that rests</l>
     <l n="189">Full in the speculation of the stars .</l>
     <l n="190">Ah ! surely he had burst our mortal bars ;</l>
     <l n="191">Into some wond'rous region he had gone ,</l>
     <l n="192">To search for thee , divine Endymion !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="193">He was a Poet , sure a lover too ,</l>
     <l n="194">Who stood on Latmus ’ top , what time there blew</l>
     <l n="195">Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below ;</l>
     <l n="196">And brought in faintness solemn , sweet , and slow</l>
     <l n="197">A hymn from Dian 's temple ; while upswelling ,</l>
     <l n="198">The incense went to her own starry dwelling .</l>
     <l n="199">But though her face was clear as infant 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="200">Though she stood smiling o'er the sacrifice ,</l>
     <l n="201">The Poet wept at her so piteous fate ,</l>
     <l n="202">Wept that such beauty should be desolate :</l>
     <l n="203">So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won ,</l>
     <l n="204">And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="205">Queen of the wide air ; thou most lovely queen</l>
     <l n="206">Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen !</l>
     <l n="207">As thou exceedest all things in thy shine ,</l>
     <l n="208">So every tale , does this sweet tale of thine .</l>
     <l n="209">O for three words of honey , that I might</l>
     <l n="210">Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="211">Where distant ships do seem to show their keels ,</l>
     <l n="212">Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels ,</l>
     <l n="213">And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="214">Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize .</l>
     <l n="215">The evening weather was so bright , and clear ,</l>
     <l n="216">That men of health were of unusual cheer ;</l>
     <l n="217">Stepping like Homer at the trumpet 's call ,</l>
     <l n="218">Or young Apollo on the pedestal :</l>
     <l n="219">And lovely women were as fair and warm ,</l>
     <l n="220">As Venus looking sideways in alarm .</l>
     <l n="221">The breezes were ethereal , and pure ,</l>
     <l n="222">And crept through half closed lattices to cure</l>
     <l n="223">The languid sick ; it cool 'd their fever 'd sleep ,</l>
     <l n="224">And soothed them into slumbers full and deep .</l>
     <l n="225">Soon they awoke clear eyed : nor burnt with thirsting ,</l>
     <l n="226">Nor with hot fingers , nor with temples bursting :</l>
     <l n="227">And springing up , they met the wond'ring sight</l>
     <l n="228">Of their dear friends , nigh foolish with delight ;</l>
     <l n="229">Who feel their arms , and breasts , and kiss and stare ,</l>
     <l n="230">And on their placid foreheads part the hair .</l>
     <l n="231">Young men , and maidens at each other gaz 'd</l>
     <l n="232">With hands held back , and motionless , amaz 'd</l>
     <l n="233">To see the brightness in each others ’ eyes ;</l>
     <l n="234">And so they stood , fill 'd with a sweet surprise ,</l>
     <l n="235">Until their tongues were loos 'd in poesy .</l>
     <l n="236">Therefore no lover did of anguish die :</l>
     <l n="237">But the soft numbers , in that moment spoken ,</l>
     <l n="238">Made silken ties , that never may be broken .</l>
     <l n="239">Cynthia ! I cannot tell the greater blisses ,</l>
     <l n="240">That follow 'd thine , and thy dear shepherd 's kisses :</l>
     <l n="241">Was there a Poet born ?— but now no more ,</l>
     <l n="242">My wand'ring spirit must no further soar .—</l>

     <l n="4">But bending in a thousand graceful ways ;</l>
     <l n="5">So graceful , that it seems no mortal hand ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or e'en the touch of Archimago 's wand ,</l>
     <l n="7">Could charm them into such an attitude .</l>
     <l n="8">We must think rather , that in playful mood ,</l>
     <l n="9">Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight ,</l>
     <l n="10">To show this wonder of its gentle might .</l>
     <l n="11">Lo ! I must tell a tale of chivalry ;</l>
     <l n="12">For while I muse , the lance points slantingly</l>
     <l n="13">Athwart the morning air : some lady sweet ,</l>
     <l n="14">Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet ,</l>
     <l n="15">From the worn top of some old battlement</l>
     <l n="16">Hails it with tears , her stout defender sent :</l>
     <l n="17">And from her own pure self no joy dissembling ,</l>
     <l n="18">Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling .</l>
     <l n="19">Sometimes , when the good Knight his rest would take ,</l>
     <l n="20">It is reflected , clearly , in a lake ,</l>
     <l n="21">With the young ashen boughs , ‘ gainst which it rests ,</l>
     <l n="22">And th ’ half seen mossiness of linnets ’ nests .</l>
     <l n="23">Ah ! shall I ever tell its cruelty ,</l>
     <l n="24">When the fire flashes from a warrior 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="25">And his tremendous hand is grasping it ,</l>
     <l n="26">And his dark brow for very wrath is knit ?</l>
     <l n="27">Or when his spirit , with more calm intent ,</l>
     <l n="28">Leaps to the honors of a tournament ,</l>
     <l n="29">And makes the gazers round about the ring</l>
     <l n="30">Stare at the grandeur of the balancing ?</l>
     <l n="31">No , no ! this is far off :— then how shall I</l>
     <l n="32">Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy ,</l>
     <l n="33">Which linger yet about lone gothic arches ,</l>
     <l n="34">In dark green ivy , and among wild larches ?</l>
     <l n="35">How sing the splendour of the revelries ,</l>
     <l n="36">When buts of wine are drunk off to the lees ?</l>
     <l n="37">And that bright lance , against the fretted wall ,</l>
     <l n="38">Beneath the shade of stately banneral ,</l>
     <l n="39">Is slung with shining cuirass , sword , and shield ?</l>
     <l n="40">Where ye may see a spur in bloody field .</l>
     <l n="41">Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces</l>
     <l n="42">Round the wide hall , and show their happy faces ;</l>
     <l n="43">Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens :</l>
     <l n="44">Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens .</l>
     <l n="45">Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry :</l>
     <l n="46">Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by ?</l>
     <l n="47">Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight ,</l>
     <l n="48">Rein in the swelling of his ample might ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="49">Spenser ! thy brows are arched , open , kind ,</l>
     <l n="50">And come like a clear sun-rise to my mind ;</l>
     <l n="51">And always does my heart with pleasure dance ,</l>
     <l n="52">When I think on thy noble countenance :</l>
     <l n="53">Where never yet was ought more earthly seen</l>
     <l n="54">Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green .</l>
     <l n="55">Therefore , great bard , I not so fearfully</l>
     <l n="56">Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh</l>
     <l n="57">My daring steps : or if thy tender care ,</l>
     <l n="58">Thus startled unaware ,</l>
     <l n="59">Be jealous that the foot of other wight</l>
     <l n="60">Should madly follow that bright path of light</l>
     <l n="61">Trac 'd by thy lov 'd Libertas ; he will speak ,</l>
     <l n="62">And tell thee that my prayer is very meek ;</l>
     <l n="63">That I will follow with due reverence ,</l>
     <l n="64">And start with awe at mine own strange pretence .</l>
     <l n="65">Him thou wilt hear ; so I will rest in hope</l>
     <l n="66">To see wide plains , fair trees and lawny slope :</l>
     <l n="67">The morn , the eve , the light , the shade , the flowers :</l>
     <l n="68">Clear streams , smooth lakes , and overlooking towers .</l>

     <l n="1">A fragment .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="2">Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake ;</l>
     <l n="3">His healthful spirit eager and awake</l>
     <l n="4">To feel the beauty of a silent eve ,</l>
     <l n="5">Which seem 'd full loath this happy world to leave ;</l>
     <l n="6">The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly .</l>
     <l n="7">He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky ,</l>
     <l n="8">And smiles at the far clearness all around ,</l>
     <l n="9">Until his heart is well nigh over wound ,</l>
     <l n="10">And turns for calmness to the pleasant green</l>
     <l n="11">Of easy slopes , and shadowy trees that lean</l>
     <l n="12">So elegantly o'er the waters ’ brim</l>
     <l n="13">And show their blossoms trim .</l>
     <l n="14">Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow</l>
     <l n="15">The freaks , and dartings of the black-wing 'd swallow ,</l>
     <l n="16">Delighting much , to see it half at rest ,</l>
     <l n="17">Dip so refreshingly its wings , and breast</l>
     <l n="18">‘ Gainst the smooth surface , and to mark anon ,</l>
     <l n="19">The widening circles into nothing gone .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">And now the sharp keel of his little boat</l>
     <l n="21">Comes up with ripple , and with easy float ,</l>
     <l n="22">And glides into a bed of water lillies :</l>
     <l n="23">Broad leav 'd are they and their white canopies</l>
     <l n="24">Are upward turn 'd to catch the heavens ’ dew .</l>
     <l n="25">Near to a little island 's point they grew ;</l>
     <l n="26">Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view</l>
     <l n="27">Of this sweet spot of earth . The bowery shore</l>
     <l n="28">Went off in gentle windings to the hoar</l>
     <l n="29">And light blue mountains : but no breathing man</l>
     <l n="30">With a warm heart , and eye prepared to scan</l>
     <l n="31">Nature 's clear beauty , could pass lightly by</l>
     <l n="32">Objects that look 'd out so invitingly</l>
     <l n="33">On either side . These , gentle Calidore</l>
     <l n="34">Greeted , as he had known them long before .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="35">The sidelong view of swelling leafiness ,</l>
     <l n="36">Which the glad setting sun , in gold doth dress ;</l>
     <l n="37">Whence ever , and anon the jay outsprings ,</l>
     <l n="38">And scales upon the beauty of its wings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">The lonely turret , shatter 'd , and outworn ,</l>
     <l n="40">Stands venerably proud ; too proud to mourn</l>
     <l n="41">Its long lost grandeur : fir trees grow around ,</l>
     <l n="42">Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="43">The little chapel with the cross above</l>
     <l n="44">Upholding wreaths of ivy ; the white dove ,</l>
     <l n="45">That on the windows spreads his feathers light ,</l>
     <l n="46">And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="47">Green tufted islands casting their soft shades</l>
     <l n="48">Across the lake ; sequester 'd leafy glades ,</l>
     <l n="49">That through the dimness of their twilight show</l>
     <l n="50">Large dock leaves , spiral foxgloves , or the glow</l>
     <l n="51">Of the wild cat 's eyes , or the silvery stems</l>
     <l n="52">Of delicate birch trees , or long grass which hems</l>
     <l n="53">A little brook . The youth had long been viewing</l>
     <l n="54">These pleasant things , and heaven was bedewing</l>
     <l n="55">The mountain flowers , when his glad senses caught</l>
     <l n="56">A trumpet 's silver voice . Ah ! it was fraught</l>
     <l n="57">With many joys for him : the warder 's ken</l>
     <l n="58">Had found white coursers prancing in the glen :</l>
     <l n="59">Friends very dear to him he soon will see ;</l>
     <l n="60">So pushes off his boat most eagerly ,</l>
     <l n="61">And soon upon the lake he skims along ,</l>
     <l n="62">Deaf to the nightingale 's first under-song ;</l>
     <l n="63">Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly :</l>
     <l n="64">His spirit flies before him so completely .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="65">And now he turns a jutting point of land ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whence may be seen the castle gloomy , and grand :</l>
     <l n="67">Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches ,</l>
     <l n="68">Before the point of his light shallop reaches</l>
     <l n="69">Those marble steps that through the water dip :</l>
     <l n="70">Now over them he goes with hasty trip ,</l>
     <l n="71">And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors :</l>
     <l n="72">Anon he leaps along the oaken floors</l>
     <l n="73">Of halls and corridors .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="74">Delicious sounds ! those little bright-eyed things</l>
     <l n="75">That float about the air on azure wings ,</l>
     <l n="76">Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang</l>
     <l n="77">Of clattering hoofs ; into the court he sprang ,</l>
     <l n="78">Just as two noble steeds , and palfreys twain ,</l>
     <l n="79">Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein ;</l>
     <l n="80">While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis</l>
     <l n="81">They brought their happy burthens . What a kiss ,</l>
     <l n="82">What gentle squeeze he gave each lady 's hand !</l>
     <l n="83">How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann 'd !</l>
     <l n="84">Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone ,</l>
     <l n="85">While whisperings of affection</l>
     <l n="86">Made him delay to let their tender feet</l>
     <l n="87">Come to the earth ; with an incline so sweet</l>
     <l n="88">From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent :</l>
     <l n="89">And whether there were tears of languishment ,</l>
     <l n="90">Or that the evening dew had pearl 'd their tresses ,</l>
     <l n="91">He feels a moisture on his cheek , and blesses</l>
     <l n="92">With lips that tremble , and with glistening eye</l>
     <l n="93">All the soft luxury</l>
     <l n="94">That nestled in his arms . A dimpled hand ,</l>
     <l n="95">Fair as some wonder out of fairy land ,</l>
     <l n="96">Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers</l>
     <l n="97">Of whitest Cassia , fresh from summer showers :</l>
     <l n="98">And this he fondled with his happy cheek</l>
     <l n="99">As if for joy he would no further seek ;</l>
     <l n="100">When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond</l>
     <l n="101">Came to his ear , like something from beyond</l>
     <l n="102">His present being : so he gently drew</l>
     <l n="103">His warm arms , thrilling now with pulses new ,</l>
     <l n="104">From their sweet thrall , and forward gently bending ,</l>
     <l n="105">Thank 'd heaven that his joy was never ending ;</l>
     <l n="106">While ‘ gainst his forehead he devoutly press 'd</l>
     <l n="107">A hand heaven made to succour the distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="108">A hand that from the world 's bleak promontory</l>
     <l n="109">Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="110">Amid the pages , and the torches ’ glare ,</l>
     <l n="111">There stood a knight , patting the flowing hair</l>
     <l n="112">Of his proud horse 's mane : he was withal</l>
     <l n="113">A man of elegance , and stature tall :</l>
     <l n="114">So that the waving of his plumes would be</l>
     <l n="115">High as the berries of a wild ash tree ,</l>
     <l n="116">Or as the winged cap of Mercury .</l>
     <l n="117">His armour was so dexterously wrought</l>
     <l n="118">In shape , that sure no living man had thought</l>
     <l n="119">It hard , and heavy steel : but that indeed</l>
     <l n="120">It was some glorious form , some splendid weed ,</l>
     <l n="121">In which a spirit new come from the skies</l>
     <l n="122">Might live , and show itself to human eyes .</l>
     <l n="123">‘ Tis the far-fam 'd , the brave Sir Gondibert ,</l>
     <l n="124">Said the good man to Calidore alert ;</l>
     <l n="125">While the young warrior with a step of grace</l>
     <l n="126">Came up ,— a courtly smile upon his face ,</l>
     <l n="127">And mailed hand held out , ready to greet</l>
     <l n="128">The large-eyed wonder , and ambitious heat</l>
     <l n="129">Of the aspiring boy ; who as he led</l>
     <l n="130">Those smiling ladies , often turned his head</l>
     <l n="131">To admire the visor arched so gracefully</l>
     <l n="132">Over a knightly brow ; while they went by</l>
     <l n="133">The lamps that from the high-roof 'd hall were pendent ,</l>
     <l n="134">And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="135">Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated ;</l>
     <l n="136">The sweet-lipp 'd ladies have already greeted</l>
     <l n="137">All the green leaves that round the window clamber ,</l>
     <l n="138">To show their purple stars , and bells of amber .</l>
     <l n="139">Sir Gondibert has doff 'd his shining steel ,</l>
     <l n="140">Gladdening in the free , and airy feel</l>
     <l n="141">Of a light mantle ; and while Clerimond</l>
     <l n="142">Is looking round about him with a fond ,</l>
     <l n="143">And placid eye , young Calidore is burning</l>
     <l n="144">To hear of knightly deeds , and gallant spurning</l>
     <l n="145">Of all unworthiness ; and how the strong of arm</l>
     <l n="146">Kept off dismay , and terror , and alarm</l>
     <l n="147">From lovely woman : while brimful of this ,</l>
     <l n="148">He gave each damsel 's hand so warm a kiss ,</l>

     <l n="150">That each at other look 'd half staringly ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="153">Softly the breezes from the forest came ,</l>
     <l n="154">Softly they blew aside the taper 's flame ;</l>

     <l n="156">Grateful the incense from the lime-tree flower ;</l>
     <l n="157">Mysterious , wild , the far heard trumpet 's tone ;</l>
     <l n="158">Lovely the moon in ether , all alone :</l>
     <l n="159">Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals ,</l>
     <l n="160">As that of busy spirits when the portals</l>
     <l n="161">Are closing in the west ; or that soft humming</l>

     <l n="75">And make “ a sun-shine in a shady place : ”</l>

    <head>TO MY BROTHER GEORGE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Full many a dreary hour have I past ,</l>
     <l n="2">My brain bewilder 'd , and my mind o'ercast</l>
     <l n="3">With heaviness ; in seasons when I 've thought</l>
     <l n="4">No spherey strains by me could e'er be caught</l>
     <l n="5">From the blue dome , though I to dimness gaze</l>
     <l n="6">On the far depth where sheeted lightning plays ;</l>
     <l n="7">Or , on the wavy grass outstretch 'd supinely ,</l>
     <l n="8">Pry ‘ mong the stars , to strive to think divinely :</l>
     <l n="9">That I should never hear Apollo 's song ,</l>
     <l n="10">Though feathery clouds were floating all along</l>
     <l n="11">The purple west , and , two bright streaks between ,</l>
     <l n="12">The golden lyre itself were dimly seen :</l>
     <l n="13">That the still murmur of the honey bee</l>
     <l n="14">Would never teach a rural song to me :</l>
     <l n="15">That the bright glance from beauty 's eyelids slanting</l>
     <l n="16">Would never make a lay of mine enchanting ,</l>
     <l n="17">Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold</l>
     <l n="18">Some tale of love and arms in time of old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">But there are times , when those that love the bay ,</l>
     <l n="20">Fly from all sorrowing far , far away ;</l>
     <l n="21">A sudden glow comes on them , nought they see</l>
     <l n="22">In water , earth , or air , but poesy .</l>
     <l n="23">It has been said , dear George , and true I hold it ,</l>
     <l n="24">( For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it ,)</l>
     <l n="25">That when a Poet is in such a trance ,</l>
     <l n="26">In air he sees white coursers paw , and prance ,</l>
     <l n="27">Bestridden of gay knights , in gay apparel ,</l>
     <l n="28">Who at each other tilt in playful quarrel ,</l>
     <l n="29">And what we , ignorantly , sheet-lightning call ,</l>
     <l n="30">Is the swift opening of their wide portal ,</l>
     <l n="31">When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear ,</l>
     <l n="32">Whose tones reach nought on earth but Poet 's ear .</l>
     <l n="33">When these enchanted portals open wide ,</l>
     <l n="34">And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide ,</l>
     <l n="35">The Poet 's eye can reach those golden halls ,</l>
     <l n="36">And view the glory of their festivals :</l>
     <l n="37">Their ladies fair , that in the distance seem</l>
     <l n="38">Fit for the silv'ring of a seraph 's dream ;</l>
     <l n="39">Their rich brimm 'd goblets , that incessant run</l>
     <l n="40">Like the bright spots that move about the sun ;</l>
     <l n="41">And , when upheld , the wine from each bright jar</l>
     <l n="42">Pours with the lustre of a falling star .</l>
     <l n="43">Yet further off , are dimly seen their bowers ,</l>
     <l n="44">Of which , no mortal eye can reach the flowers ;</l>
     <l n="45">And ‘ tis right just , for well Apollo knows</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Twould make the Poet quarrel with the rose .</l>
     <l n="47">All that 's reveal 'd from that far seat of blisses ,</l>
     <l n="48">Is , the clear fountains ’ interchanging kisses .</l>
     <l n="49">As gracefully descending , light and thin ,</l>
     <l n="50">Like silver streaks across a dolphin 's fin ,</l>
     <l n="51">When he upswimmeth from the coral caves .</l>
     <l n="52">And sports with half his tail above the waves .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="53">These wonders strange be sees , and many more ,</l>
     <l n="54">Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore .</l>
     <l n="55">Should he upon an evening ramble fare</l>
     <l n="56">With forehead to the soothing breezes bare ,</l>
     <l n="57">Would he naught see but the dark , silent blue</l>
     <l n="58">With all its diamonds trembling through and through :</l>
     <l n="59">Or the coy moon , when in the waviness</l>
     <l n="60">Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress ,</l>
     <l n="61">And staidly paces higher up , and higher ,</l>
     <l n="62">Like a sweet nun in holy-day attire ?</l>
     <l n="63">Ah , yes ! much more would start into his sight —</l>
     <l n="64">The revelries , and mysteries of night :</l>
     <l n="65">And should I ever see them , I will tell you</l>
     <l n="66">Such tales as needs must with amazement spell you .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="67">These are the living pleasures of the bard :</l>
     <l n="68">But richer far posterity 's award .</l>
     <l n="69">What does he murmur with his latest breath ,</l>
     <l n="70">While his proud eye looks through the film of death ?</l>
     <l n="71">“ What though I leave this dull , and earthly mould ,</l>
     <l n="72">Yet shall my spirit lofty converse hold</l>
     <l n="73">With after times .— The patriot shall feel</l>
     <l n="74">My stern alarum , and unsheath his steel ;</l>
     <l n="75">Or , in the senate thunder out my numbers</l>
     <l n="76">To startle princes from their easy slumbers .</l>
     <l n="77">The sage will mingle with each moral theme</l>
     <l n="78">My happy thoughts sententious ; he will teem</l>
     <l n="79">With lofty periods when my verses fire him ,</l>
     <l n="80">And then I 'll stoop from heaven to inspire him .</l>
     <l n="81">Lays have I left of such a dear delight</l>
     <l n="82">That maids will sing them on their bridal night .</l>
     <l n="83">Gay villagers , upon a morn of May</l>
     <l n="84">When they have tired their gentle limbs , with play ,</l>
     <l n="85">And form 'd a snowy circle on the grass ,</l>
     <l n="86">And plac 'd in midst of all that lovely lass</l>
     <l n="87">Who chosen is their queen ,— with her fine head</l>
     <l n="88">Crowned with flowers purple , white , and red :</l>
     <l n="89">For there the lily , and the musk-rose , sighing ,</l>
     <l n="90">Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying :</l>
     <l n="91">Between her breasts , that never yet felt trouble ,</l>
     <l n="92">A bunch of violets full blown , and double ,</l>
     <l n="93">Serenely sleep :— she from a casket takes</l>
     <l n="94">A little book ,— and then a joy awakes</l>
     <l n="95">About each youthful heart ,— with stifled cries ,</l>
     <l n="96">And rubbing of white hands , and sparkling eyes :</l>
     <l n="97">For she 's to read a tale of hopes , and fears ;</l>
     <l n="98">One that I foster 'd in my youthful years :</l>
     <l n="99">The pearls , that on each glist'ning circlet sleep ,</l>
     <l n="100">Gush ever and anon with silent creep ,</l>
     <l n="101">Lured by the innocent dimples . To sweet rest</l>
     <l n="102">Shall the dear babe , upon its mother 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="103">Be lull 'd with songs of mine . Fair world , adieu !</l>
     <l n="104">Thy dales , and hills , are fading from my view :</l>
     <l n="105">Swiftly I mount , upon wide spreading pinions ,</l>
     <l n="106">Far from the narrow bounds of thy dominions .</l>
     <l n="107">Full joy I feel , while thus I cleave the air ,</l>
     <l n="108">That my soft verse will charm thy daughters fair ,</l>
     <l n="109">And warm thy sons ! ” Ah , my dear friend and brother ,</l>
     <l n="110">Could I , at once , my mad ambition smother ,</l>
     <l n="111">For tasting joys like these , sure I should be</l>
     <l n="112">Happier , and dearer to society .</l>
     <l n="113">At times , ‘ tis true , I 've felt relief from pain</l>
     <l n="114">When some bright thought has darted through my brain :</l>
     <l n="115">Through all that day I 've felt a greater pleasure</l>
     <l n="116">Than if I 'd brought to light a hidden treasure .</l>
     <l n="117">As to my sonnets , though none else should heed them ,</l>
     <l n="118">I feel delighted , still , that you should read them .</l>
     <l n="119">Of late , too , I have had much calm enjoyment ,</l>
     <l n="120">Stretch 'd on the grass at my best lov 'd employment</l>
     <l n="121">Of scribbling lines for you . These things I thought</l>
     <l n="122">While , in my face , the freshest breeze I caught .</l>
     <l n="123">E'en now I 'm pillow 'd on a bed of flowers</l>
     <l n="124">That crowns a lofty clift , which proudly towers</l>
     <l n="125">Above the ocean-waves . The stalks , and blades ,</l>
     <l n="126">Chequer my tablet with their , quivering shades .</l>
     <l n="127">On one side is a field of drooping oats ,</l>
     <l n="128">Through which the poppies show their scarlet coats</l>
     <l n="129">So pert and useless , that they bring to mind</l>
     <l n="130">The scarlet coats that pester human-kind .</l>
     <l n="131">And on the other side , outspread , is seen</l>
     <l n="132">Ocean 's blue mantle streak 'd with purple , and green .</l>
     <l n="133">Now ‘ tis I see a canvass 'd ship , and now</l>
     <l n="134">Mark the bright silver curling round her prow .</l>
     <l n="135">I see the lark down-dropping to his nest .</l>
     <l n="136">And the broad winged sea-gull never at rest ;</l>
     <l n="137">For when no more he spreads his feathers free ,</l>
     <l n="138">His breast is dancing on the restless sea .</l>
     <l n="139">Now I direct my eyes into the west ,</l>
     <l n="140">Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest :</l>
     <l n="141">Why westward turn ? ‘ Twas but to say adieu !</l>
     <l n="142">‘ Twas but to kiss my hand , dear George , to you !</l>

    <head>TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning ,</l>
     <l n="2">And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning ;</l>
     <l n="3">He slants his neck beneath the waters bright</l>
     <l n="4">So silently , it seems a beam of light</l>
     <l n="5">Come from the galaxy : anon he sports ,—</l>
     <l n="6">With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts ,</l>
     <l n="7">Or ruffles all the surface of the lake</l>
     <l n="8">In striving from its crystal face to take</l>
     <l n="9">Some diamond water drops , and them to treasure</l>
     <l n="10">In milky nest , and sip them off at leisure .</l>
     <l n="11">But not a moment can he there insure them ,</l>
     <l n="12">Nor to such downy rest can he allure them ;</l>
     <l n="13">For down they rush as though they would be free ,</l>
     <l n="14">And drop like hours into eternity .</l>
     <l n="15">Just like that bird am I in loss of time ,</l>
     <l n="16">Whene'er I venture on the stream of rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="17">With shatter 'd boat , oar snapt , and canvass rent ,</l>
     <l n="18">I slowly sail , scarce knowing my intent ;</l>
     <l n="19">Still scooping up the water with my fingers ,</l>
     <l n="20">In which a trembling diamond never lingers .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="21">By this , friend Charles , you may full plainly see</l>
     <l n="22">Why I have never penn 'd a line to thee :</l>
     <l n="23">Because my thoughts were never free , and clear ,</l>
     <l n="24">And little fit to please a classic ear ;</l>
     <l n="25">Because my wine was of too poor a savour</l>
     <l n="26">For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour</l>
     <l n="27">Of sparkling Helicon :— small good it were</l>
     <l n="28">To take him to a desert rude , and bare .</l>
     <l n="29">Who had on Baiae 's shore reclin 'd at ease ,</l>
     <l n="30">While Tasso 's page was floating in a breeze</l>
     <l n="31">That gave soft music from Armida 's bowers ,</l>
     <l n="32">Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers :</l>
     <l n="33">Small good to one who had by Mulla 's stream</l>
     <l n="34">Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream ;</l>
     <l n="35">Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook ,</l>
     <l n="36">And lovely Una in a leafy nook ,</l>
     <l n="37">And Archimago leaning o'er his book :</l>
     <l n="38">Who had of all that 's sweet tasted , and seen ,</l>
     <l n="39">From silv'ry ripple , up to beauty 's queen ;</l>
     <l n="40">From the sequester 'd haunts of gay Titania ,</l>
     <l n="41">To the blue dwelling of divine Urania :</l>
     <l n="42">One , who , of late , had ta'en sweet forest walks</l>
     <l n="43">With him who elegantly chats , and talks —</l>
     <l n="44">The wrong 'd Libert as ,— who has told you stories</l>
     <l n="45">Of laurel chaplets , and Apollo 's glories ;</l>
     <l n="46">Of troops chivalrous prancing ; through a city ,</l>
     <l n="47">And tearful ladies made for love , and pity :</l>
     <l n="48">With many else which I have never known .</l>
     <l n="49">Thus have I thought ; and days on days have flown</l>
     <l n="50">Slowly , or rapidly — unwilling still</l>
     <l n="51">For you to try my dull , unlearned quill .</l>
     <l n="52">Nor should I now , but that I 've known you long ;</l>
     <l n="53">That you first taught me all the sweets of song :</l>
     <l n="54">The grand , the sweet , the terse , the free , the fine ;</l>
     <l n="55">What swell 'd with pathos , and what right divine :</l>
     <l n="56">Spenserian vowels that elope with ease ,</l>
     <l n="57">And float along like birds o'er summer seas ;</l>
     <l n="58">Miltonian storms , and more , Miltonian tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="59">Michael in arms , and more , meek Eve 's fair slenderness .</l>
     <l n="60">Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly</l>
     <l n="61">Up to its climax and then dying proudly ?</l>
     <l n="62">Who found for me the grandeur of the ode ,</l>
     <l n="63">Growing , like Atlas , stronger from its load ?</l>
     <l n="64">Who let me taste that more than cordial dram ,</l>
     <l n="65">The sharp , the rapier-pointed epigram ?</l>
     <l n="66">Shew 'd me that epic was of all the king ,</l>
     <l n="67">Round , vast , and spanning all like Saturn 's ring ?</l>
     <l n="68">You too upheld the veil from Clio 's beauty ,</l>
     <l n="69">And pointed out the patriot 's stern duty ;</l>
     <l n="70">The might of Alfred , and the shaft of Tell ;</l>
     <l n="71">The hand of Brutus , that so grandly fell</l>
     <l n="72">Upon a tyrant 's head . Ah ! had I never seen ,</l>
     <l n="73">Or known your kindness , what might I have been ?</l>
     <l n="74">What my enjoyments in my youthful years ,</l>
     <l n="75">Bereft of all that now my life endears ?</l>
     <l n="76">And can I e'er these benefits forget ?</l>
     <l n="77">And can I e'er repay the friendly debt ?</l>
     <l n="78">No , doubly no ;— yet should these rhymings please ,</l>
     <l n="79">I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease :</l>
     <l n="80">For I have long time been my fancy feeding</l>
     <l n="81">With hopes that you would one day think the reading</l>
     <l n="82">Of my rough verses not an hour misspent ;</l>
     <l n="83">Should it e'er be so , what a rich content !</l>
     <l n="84">Some weeks have pass 'd since last I saw the spires</l>
     <l n="85">In lucent Thames reflected :— warm desires</l>
     <l n="86">To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness ,</l>
     <l n="87">And morning shadows streaking into slimness</l>
     <l n="88">Across the lawny fields , and pebbly water ;</l>
     <l n="89">To mark the time as they grow broad , and shorter ;</l>
     <l n="90">To feel the air that plays about the hills ,</l>
     <l n="91">And sips its freshness from the little rills ;</l>
     <l n="92">To see high , golden corn wave in the light</l>
     <l n="93">When Cynthia smiles upon a summer 's night ,</l>
     <l n="94">And peers among the cloudlet 's jet and white ,</l>
     <l n="95">As though she were reclining in a bed</l>
     <l n="96">Of bean blossoms , in heaven freshly shed .</l>
     <l n="97">No sooner had I stepp 'd into these pleasures</l>
     <l n="98">Than I began to think of rhymes and measures :</l>
     <l n="99">The air that floated by me seem 'd to say</l>
     <l n="100">“ Write ! thou wilt never have a better day . ”</l>
     <l n="101">And so I did . When many lines I 'd written ,</l>
     <l n="102">Though with their grace I was not oversmitten ,</l>
     <l n="103">Yet , as my hand was warm , I thought I 'd better</l>
     <l n="104">Trust to my feelings , and write you a letter .</l>
     <l n="105">Such an attempt required an inspiration</l>
     <l n="106">Of a peculiar sort ,— a consummation ;—</l>
     <l n="107">Which , had I felt , these scribblings might have been</l>
     <l n="108">Verses from which the soul would never wean :</l>
     <l n="109">But many days have past since last my heart</l>
     <l n="110">Was warm 'd luxuriously by divine Mozart ;</l>
     <l n="111">By Arne delighted , or by Handel madden 'd ;</l>
     <l n="112">Or by the song of Erin pierc 'd and sadden 'd :</l>
     <l n="113">What time you were before the music sitting ,</l>
     <l n="114">And the rich notes to each sensation fitting .</l>
     <l n="115">Since I have walk 'd with you through shady lanes</l>
     <l n="116">That freshly terminate in open plains ,</l>
     <l n="117">And revel 'd in a chat that ceased not</l>
     <l n="118">When at night-fall among your books we got :</l>
     <l n="119">No , nor when supper came , nor after that ,—</l>
     <l n="120">Nor when reluctantly I took my hat ;</l>
     <l n="121">No , nor till cordially you shook my hand</l>
     <l n="122">Mid-way between our homes :— your accents bland</l>
     <l n="123">Still sounded in my ears , when I no more</l>
     <l n="124">Could hear your footsteps touch the grav'ly floor .</l>
     <l n="125">Sometimes I lost them , and then found again ;</l>

      <l n="5">The ocean with its vastness , its blue green ,</l>
      <l n="6">Its ships , its rocks , its caves , its hopes , its fears ,—</l>
      <l n="7">Its voice mysterious , which whoso hears</l>

      <l n="9">E'en now , dear George , while this for you I write ,</l>
      <l n="10">Cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping</l>
      <l n="11">So scantly , that it seems her bridal night ,</l>
      <l n="12">And she her half-discover 'd revels keeping .</l>

     <l n="1">What is more gentle than a wind in summer ?</l>
     <l n="2">What is more soothing than the pretty hummer</l>
     <l n="3">That stays one moment in an open flower ,</l>
     <l n="4">And buzzes cheerily from bower to bower ?</l>
     <l n="5">What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing</l>
     <l n="6">In a green island , far from all men 's knowing ?</l>
     <l n="7">More healthful than the leafiness of dales ?</l>
     <l n="8">More secret than a nest of nightingales ?</l>
     <l n="9">More serene than Cordelia 's countenance ?</l>
     <l n="10">More full of visions than a high romance ?</l>
     <l n="11">What , but thee Sleep ? Soft closer of our eyes !</l>
     <l n="12">Low murmurer of tender lullabies !</l>
     <l n="13">Light hoverer around our happy pillows !</l>
     <l n="14">Wreather of poppy buds , and weeping willows !</l>
     <l n="15">Silent entangler of a beauty 's tresses !</l>
     <l n="16">Most happy listener ! when the morning blesses</l>
     <l n="17">Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes</l>
     <l n="18">That glance so brightly at the new sun-rise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">But what is higher beyond thought than thee ?</l>
     <l n="20">Fresher than berries of a mountain tree ?</l>
     <l n="21">More strange , more beautiful , more smooth , more regal ,</l>
     <l n="22">Than wings of swans , than doves , than dim-seen eagle ?</l>
     <l n="23">What is it ? And to what shall I compare it ?</l>
     <l n="24">It has a glory , and nought else can share it :</l>
     <l n="25">The thought thereof is awful , sweet , and holy ,</l>
     <l n="26">Chacing away all worldliness and folly ;</l>
     <l n="27">Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or the low rumblings earth 's regions under ;</l>
     <l n="29">And sometimes like a gentle whispering</l>
     <l n="30">Of all the secrets of some wond'rous thing</l>
     <l n="31">That breathes about us in the vacant air ;</l>
     <l n="32">So that we look around with prying stare ,</l>
     <l n="33">Perhaps to see shapes of light , aerial lymning ,</l>
     <l n="34">And catch soft floatings from a faint-heard hymning ;</l>
     <l n="35">To see the laurel wreath , on high suspended ,</l>
     <l n="36">That is to crown our name when life is ended .</l>
     <l n="37">Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice ,</l>
     <l n="38">And from the heart up-springs , rejoice ! rejoice !</l>
     <l n="39">Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things ,</l>
     <l n="40">And die away in ardent mutterings .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="41">No one who once the glorious sun has seen ,</l>
     <l n="42">And all the clouds , and felt his bosom clean</l>
     <l n="43">For his great Maker 's presence , but must know</l>
     <l n="44">What ‘ tis I mean , and feel his being glow :</l>
     <l n="45">Therefore no insult will I give his spirit ,</l>
     <l n="46">By telling what he sees from native merit .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="47">O Poesy ! for thee I hold my pen</l>
     <l n="48">That am not yet a glorious denizen</l>
     <l n="49">Of thy wide heaven — Should I rather kneel</l>
     <l n="50">Upon some mountain-top until I feel</l>
     <l n="51">A glowing splendour round about me hung ,</l>
     <l n="52">And echo back the voice of thine own tongue ?</l>
     <l n="53">O Poesy ! for thee I grasp my pen</l>
     <l n="54">That am not yet a glorious denizen</l>
     <l n="55">Of thy wide heaven ; yet , to my ardent prayer ,</l>
     <l n="56">Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air ,</l>
     <l n="57">Smoothed for intoxication by the breath</l>
     <l n="58">Of flowering bays , that I may die a death</l>
     <l n="59">Of luxury , and my young spirit follow</l>
     <l n="60">The morning sun-beams to the great Apollo</l>
     <l n="61">Like a fresh sacrifice ; or , if I can bear</l>
     <l n="62">The o'erwhelming sweets , ‘ twill bring to me the fair</l>
     <l n="63">Visions of all places : a bowery nook</l>
     <l n="64">Will be elysium — an eternal book</l>
     <l n="65">Whence I may copy many a lovely saying</l>
     <l n="66">About the leaves , and flowers — about the playing</l>
     <l n="67">Of nymphs in woods , and fountains ; and the shade</l>
     <l n="68">Keeping a silence round a sleeping maid ;</l>
     <l n="69">And many a verse from so strange influence</l>
     <l n="70">That we must ever wonder how , and whence</l>
     <l n="71">It came . Also imaginings will hover</l>
     <l n="72">Round my fire-side , and haply there discover</l>
     <l n="73">Vistas of solemn beauty , where I 'd wander</l>
     <l n="74">In happy silence , like the clear meander</l>
     <l n="75">Through its lone vales ; and where I found a spot</l>
     <l n="76">Of awfuller shade , or an enchanted grot ,</l>
     <l n="77">Or a green hill o'erspread with chequered dress</l>
     <l n="78">Of flowers , and fearful from its loveliness ,</l>
     <l n="79">Write on my tablets all that was permitted ,</l>
     <l n="80">All that was for our human senses fitted .</l>
     <l n="81">Then the events of this wide world I 'd seize</l>
     <l n="82">Like a strong giant , and my spirit teaze</l>
     <l n="83">Till at its shoulders it should proudly see</l>
     <l n="84">Wings to find out an immortality .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="85">Stop and consider ! life is but a day ;</l>
     <l n="86">A fragile dew-drop on its perilous way</l>
     <l n="87">From a tree 's summit ; a poor Indian 's sleep</l>
     <l n="88">While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep</l>
     <l n="89">Of Montmorenci . Why so sad a moan ?</l>
     <l n="90">Life is the rose 's hope while yet unblown ;</l>
     <l n="91">The reading of an ever-changing tale ;</l>
     <l n="92">The light uplifting of a maiden 's veil ;</l>
     <l n="93">A pigeon tumbling in clear summer air ;</l>
     <l n="94">A laughing school-boy , without grief or care ,</l>
     <l n="95">Riding the springy branches of an elm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="96">O for ten years , that I may overwhelm</l>
     <l n="97">Myself in poesy ; so I may do the deed</l>
     <l n="98">That my own soul has to itself decreed .</l>
     <l n="99">Then will I pass the countries that I see</l>
     <l n="100">In long perspective , and continually</l>
     <l n="101">Taste their pure fountains . First the realm I 'll pass</l>
     <l n="102">Of Flora , and old Pan : sleep in the grass ,</l>
     <l n="103">Feed upon apples red , and strawberries ,</l>
     <l n="104">And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees ;</l>
     <l n="105">Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places ,</l>
     <l n="106">To woo sweet kisses from averted faces ,—</l>
     <l n="107">Play with their fingers , touch their shoulders white</l>
     <l n="108">Into a pretty shrinking with a bite</l>
     <l n="109">As hard as lips can make it : till agreed ,</l>
     <l n="110">A lovely tale of human life we 'll read .</l>
     <l n="111">And one will teach a tame dove how it best</l>
     <l n="112">May fan the cool air gently o'er my rest ;</l>
     <l n="113">Another , bending o'er her nimble tread ,</l>
     <l n="114">Will set a green robe floating round her head ,</l>
     <l n="115">And still will dance with ever varied case ,</l>
     <l n="116">Smiling upon the flowers and the trees :</l>
     <l n="117">Another will entice me on , and on</l>
     <l n="118">Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon ;</l>
     <l n="119">Till in the bosom of a leafy world</l>
     <l n="120">We rest in silence , like two gems upcurl 'd</l>
     <l n="121">In the recesses of a pearly shell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="122">And can I ever bid these joys farewell ?</l>
     <l n="123">Yes , I must pass them for a nobler life ,</l>
     <l n="124">Where I may find the agonies , the strife</l>
     <l n="125">Of human hearts : for lo ! I see afar ,</l>
     <l n="126">O'er sailing the blue cragginess , a car</l>
     <l n="127">And steeds with streamy manes — the charioteer</l>
     <l n="128">Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear :</l>
     <l n="129">And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly</l>
     <l n="130">Along a huge cloud 's ridge ; and now with sprightly</l>
     <l n="131">Wheel downward come they into fresher skies ,</l>
     <l n="132">Tipt round with silver from the sun 's bright eyes .</l>
     <l n="133">Still downward with capacious whirl they glide ,</l>
     <l n="134">And now I see them on a green-hill 's side</l>
     <l n="135">In breezy rest among the nodding stalks .</l>
     <l n="136">The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks</l>
     <l n="137">To the trees and mountains ; and there soon appear</l>
     <l n="138">Shapes of delight , of mystery , and fear ,</l>
     <l n="139">Passing along before a dusky space</l>
     <l n="140">Made by some mighty oaks : as they would chase</l>
     <l n="141">Some ever-fleeting music on they sweep .</l>
     <l n="142">Lo ! how they murmur , laugh , and smile , and weep :</l>
     <l n="143">Some with upholden hand and mouth severe ;</l>
     <l n="144">Some with their faces muffled to the ear</l>
     <l n="145">Between their arms ; some , clear in youthful bloom ,</l>
     <l n="146">Go glad and smilingly , athwart the gloom ;</l>
     <l n="147">Some looking back , and some with upward gaze ;</l>
     <l n="148">Yes , thousands in a thousand different ways</l>
     <l n="149">Flit onward — now a lovely wreath of girls</l>
     <l n="150">Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls ;</l>
     <l n="151">And now broad wings . Most awfully intent</l>
     <l n="152">The driver , of those steeds is forward bent ,</l>
     <l n="153">And seems to listen : O that I might know</l>
     <l n="154">All that he writes with such a hurrying glow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="155">The visions all are fled — the car is fled</l>
     <l n="156">Into the light of heaven , and in their stead</l>
     <l n="157">A sense of real things comes doubly strong ,</l>
     <l n="158">And , like a muddy stream , would bear along</l>
     <l n="159">My soul to nothingness : but I will strive</l>
     <l n="160">Against all doublings , and will keep alive</l>
     <l n="161">The thought of that same chariot , and the strange</l>
     <l n="162">Journey it went .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="163">Is there so small a range</l>

     <l n="166">As she was wont of old ? prepare her steeds ,</l>
     <l n="167">Paw up against the light , and do strange deeds</l>
     <l n="168">Upon the clouds ? Has she not shewn us all ?</l>
     <l n="169">From the clear space of ether , to the small</l>
     <l n="170">Breath of new buds unfolding ? From the meaning</l>
     <l n="171">Of Jove 's large eye-brow , to the tender greening</l>
     <l n="172">Of April meadows ? Here her altar shone ,</l>
     <l n="173">E'en in this isle ; and who could paragon</l>
     <l n="174">The fervid choir that lifted up a noise</l>
     <l n="175">Of harmony , to where it aye will poise</l>
     <l n="176">Its mighty self of convoluting sound ,</l>
     <l n="177">Huge as a planet , and like that roll round ,</l>
     <l n="178">Eternally around a dizzy void ?</l>
     <l n="179">Ay , in those days the Muses were nigh cloy 'd</l>
     <l n="180">With honors ; nor had any other care</l>
     <l n="181">Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair .</l>

     <l n="182">Could all this be forgotten ? Yes , a schism</l>

     <l n="185">Men were thought wise who could not understand</l>
     <l n="186">His glories : with a puling infant 's force</l>
     <l n="187">They sway 'd about upon a rocking horse ,</l>

     <l n="189">The winds of heaven blew , the ocean roll 'd</l>
     <l n="190">Its gathering waves — ye felt it not . The blue</l>
     <l n="191">Bared its eternal bosom , and the dew</l>
     <l n="192">Of summer nights collected still to make</l>
     <l n="193">The morning precious : beauty was awake !</l>
     <l n="194">Why were ye not awake ? But ye were dead</l>
     <l n="195">To things ye knew not of ,— were closely wed</l>

     <l n="202">Of Poesy . Ill-fated , impious race !</l>
     <l n="203">That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face ,</l>

     <l n="292">To clear conceiving : yet there ever rolls</l>
     <l n="293">A vast idea before me , and I glean</l>
     <l n="294">Therefrom my liberty ; thence too I 've seen</l>
     <l n="295">The end and aim of Poesy . ‘ Tis clear</l>
     <l n="296">As any thing most true ; as that the year</l>
     <l n="297">Is made of the four seasons — manifest</l>
     <l n="298">As a large cross , some old cathedral 's crest ,</l>
     <l n="299">Lifted to the white clouds . Therefore should I</l>
     <l n="300">Be but the essence of deformity ,</l>
     <l n="301">A coward , did my very eye-lids wink</l>
     <l n="302">At speaking out what I have dared to think .</l>
     <l n="303">Ah ! rather let me like a madman run</l>
     <l n="304">Over some precipice ; let the hot sun</l>
     <l n="305">Melt my Dedalian wings , and drive me down</l>
     <l n="306">Convuls 'd and headlong ! Stay ! an inward frown</l>
     <l n="307">Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile .</l>
     <l n="308">An ocean dim , sprinkled with many an isle ,</l>
     <l n="309">Spreads awfully before me . How much toil !</l>
     <l n="310">How many days ! what desperate turmoil !</l>
     <l n="311">Ere I can have explored its widenesses .</l>
     <l n="312">Ah , what a task ! upon my bended knees ,</l>
     <l n="313">I could unsay those — no , impossible !</l>
     <l n="314">Impossible !</l>

     <l n="315">For sweet relief I 'll dwell</l>
     <l n="316">On humbler thoughts , and let this strange assay</l>
     <l n="317">Begun in gentleness die so away .</l>
     <l n="318">E'en now all tumult from my bosom fades :</l>
     <l n="319">I turn full hearted to the friendly aids</l>
     <l n="320">That smooth the path of honour ; brotherhood ,</l>
     <l n="321">And friendliness the nurse of mutual good .</l>
     <l n="322">The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet</l>
     <l n="323">Into the brain ere one can think upon it ;</l>
     <l n="324">The silence when some rhymes are coming out ;</l>
     <l n="325">And when they 're come , the very pleasant rout :</l>
     <l n="326">The message certain to be done to-morrow .</l>
     <l n="327">‘ Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow</l>
     <l n="328">Some precious book from out its snug retreat ,</l>
     <l n="329">To cluster round it when we next shall meet .</l>
     <l n="330">Scarce can I scribble on ; for lovely airs</l>
     <l n="331">Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs ;</l>
     <l n="332">Many delights of that glad day recalling ,</l>
     <l n="333">When first my senses caught their tender falling .</l>
     <l n="334">And with these airs come forms of elegance</l>
     <l n="335">Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse 's prance ,</l>
     <l n="336">Careless , and grand — fingers soft and round</l>
     <l n="337">Parting luxuriant curls ;— and the swift bound</l>
     <l n="338">Of Bacchus from his chariot , when his eye</l>
     <l n="339">Made Ariadne 's cheek look blushingly .</l>
     <l n="340">Thus I remember all the pleasant flow</l>

     <l n="342">Things such as these are ever harbingers</l>
     <l n="343">To trains of peaceful images : the stirs</l>
     <l n="344">Of a swan 's neck unseen among the rushes :</l>
     <l n="345">A linnet starting all about the bushes :</l>
     <l n="346">A butterfly , with golden wings broad parted ,</l>
     <l n="347">Nestling a rose , convuls 'd as though it smarted</l>
     <l n="348">With over pleasure — many , many more ,</l>
     <l n="349">Might I indulge at large in all my store</l>
     <l n="350">Of luxuries : yet I must not forget</l>
     <l n="351">Sleep , quiet with his poppy coronet :</l>
     <l n="352">For what there may be worthy in these rhymes</l>
     <l n="353">I partly owe to him : and thus , the chimes</l>
     <l n="354">Of friendly voices had just given place</l>
     <l n="355">To as sweet a silence , when I ‘ gan retrace</l>
     <l n="356">The pleasant day , upon a couch at ease .</l>
     <l n="357">It was a poet 's house who keeps the keys</l>
     <l n="358">Of pleasure 's temple . Round about were hung</l>
     <l n="359">The glorious features of the bards who sung</l>
     <l n="360">In other ages — cold and sacred busts</l>
     <l n="361">Smiled at each other . Happy he who trusts</l>
     <l n="362">To clear Futurity his darling fame !</l>
     <l n="363">Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim</l>
     <l n="364">At swelling apples with a frisky leap</l>
     <l n="365">And reaching fingers , ‘ mid a luscious heap</l>
     <l n="366">Of vine leaves . Then there rose to view a fane</l>
     <l n="367">Of liny marble , and thereto a train</l>
     <l n="368">Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward :</l>
     <l n="369">One , loveliest , holding her white band toward</l>
     <l n="370">The dazzling sun-rise : two sisters sweet</l>
     <l n="371">Bending their graceful figures till they meet</l>
     <l n="372">Over the trippings of a little child :</l>
     <l n="373">And some are hearing , eagerly , the wild</l>
     <l n="374">Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping .</l>
     <l n="375">See , in another picture , nymphs are wiping</l>
     <l n="376">Cherishingly Diana 's timorous limbs ;—</l>
     <l n="377">A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims</l>
     <l n="378">At the bath 's edge , and keeps a gentle motion</l>
     <l n="379">With the subsiding crystal : as when ocean</l>
     <l n="380">Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness o'er</l>
     <l n="381">Its rocky marge , and balances once more</l>
     <l n="382">The patient weeds ; that now unshent by foam</l>
     <l n="383">Feel all about their undulating home .</l>
