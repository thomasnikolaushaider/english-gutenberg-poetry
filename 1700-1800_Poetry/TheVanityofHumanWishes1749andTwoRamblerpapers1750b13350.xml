    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The pieces reproduced in this little volume are now beginning to bid for notice from their third century of readers . At the time they were written , although Johnson had already done enough miscellaneous literary work to fill several substantial volumes , his name , far from identifying an “ Age ” , was virtually unknown to the general public . The Vanity of Human Wishes was the first of his writings to bear his name on its face . There were some who knew him to be the author of the vigorous satire , London , and of the still more remarkable biographical study , An Account of the Life of Mr. Richard Savage ; and a few interested persons were aware that he was engaged in compiling an English Dictionary , and intended to edit Shakespeare . He was also , at the moment , attracting brief but not over-favorable attention as the author of one of the season 's new crop of tragedies at Drury Lane . But The Vanity of Human Wishes and The Rambler were a potent force in establishing Johnson 's claim to a permanent place in English letters . The Vanity appeared early in January , 1749 ; The Rambler ran from March 20 , 1749 / 50 to March 14 , 1752 . With the exception of five numbers and two quoted letters , the periodical was written entirely by Johnson .</p>
    <p n="2">As moral essays , the Ramblers deeply stirred some readers and bored others . Young Boswell , not unduly saturnine in temperament , was profoundly impressed by them and determined on their account to seek out the author . Taine , a century later , discovered that he already knew by heart all they had to teach and warned his readers away from them . Generally speaking , they were valued as they deserved by the eighteenth century and undervalued by the nineteenth . The first half of the twentieth has shown a marked impulse to restore them , as a series , to a place of honor second only to the work of Addison and Steele in the same form . Raleigh , in 1907 , paid discriminating tribute to their humanity . If read , he observed , against a knowledge of their author 's life , “ the pages of The Rambler are aglow with the earnestness of dear-bought conviction , and rich in conclusions gathered not from books but from life and suffering . ” And later : “ We come to closer quarters with Johnson in the best pages of The Rambler than in the most brilliant of the conversations recalled by Boswell . The hero of a hundred fights puts off his armour , and becomes a wise and tender confessor . ” Latterly , the style of Johnson 's essays has been subjected to a closer scrutiny than ever before . What Taine found as inflexible and inert as a pudding-mold is now seen to be charged with life and movement , vibrant with light and shadow and color . More particularly , Wimsatt has shown how intimately connected is the vocabulary of The Rambler with Johnson 's reading for the Dictionary , and how , having mastered the words of the experimental scientists of the previous century , Johnson proceeded to put them to original uses , generating with them new stylistic overtones in contexts now humorously precise , now philosophically metaphorical , employing them now for purposes of irony and satire , and again for striking directly home to the roots of morality and religion . In a playful mood , he is never more characteristic than when he is his own mimic , propounding with mock seriousness some preposterous theory like that of the intellectual advantages of living in a garret :</p>
    <p n="3">I have discovered ... that the tenuity of a defecated air at a proper distance from the surface of the earth accelerates the fancy , and sets at liberty those intellectual powers which were before shackled by too strong attraction , and unable to expand themselves under the pressure of a gross atmosphere . I have found dullness to quicken into sentiment in a thin ether , as water , though not very hot , boils in a receiver partly exhausted ; and heads , in appearance empty , have teemed with notions upon rising ground , as the flaccid sides of a football would have swelled out into stiffness and extension .</p>
    <p n="4">This is one side of his genius ; but another , and profounder , appears in the eloquent simplicity of such a passage as the following , against our fears of lessening ourselves in the eyes of others :</p>
    <p n="5">The most useful medicines are often unpleasing to the taste . Those who are oppressed by their own reputation will , perhaps , not be comforted by hearing that their cares are unnecessary . But the truth is that no man is much regarded by the rest of the world . He that considers how little he dwells upon the condition of others , will learn how little the attention of others is attracted to himself . While we see multitudes passing before us , of whom , perhaps , not one appears to deserve our notice , or excite our sympathy , we should remember that we likewise are lost in the same throng ; that the eye which happens to glance upon us is turned in a moment on him that follows us , and that the utmost which we can reasonably hope or fear is , to fill a vacant hour with prattle , and be forgotten .</p>
    <p n="6">When we approach Johnson 's poetry , the revolution of taste becomes a more acute consideration . It seems very nearly impossible to compare or contrast eighteenth-century poetry and that of the twentieth without wilfully tipping the scales in one direction or the other , judgment in this area being so much influenced by preference . But let us begin with titles . For a start , let us take , from a recent Pulitzer Prize-winner : “ The Day 's No Rounder Than Its Angles Are ” , and “ Do n't Look Now But Mary Is Everybody ” ; from another distinguished current volume , these : “ The Trance ” , “ Lost ” , “ Meeting ” ; from another , “ After This , Sea ” , “ Lineman Calling ” , “ Meaning Motion ” ; and from a fourth , “ Terror ” , “ Picnic Remembered ” , “ Eidolon ” , and “ Monologue at Midnight ” . Here are individual assertions , suggestive of individual ways of looking at things ; here are headings that signalize particular events in the authors ’ experience ,— moments ’ monuments . Beside them , Johnson 's title , “ The Vanity of Human Wishes ” , looks very dogged and downright .</p>
    <p n="7">Titles are not poems but they have a barometric function . The modern titles cited above are evocative of a world with which , for the past century and a half , we have been growing increasingly familiar . This air we are accustomed to breathe : it requires no unusual effort of adjustment from us . We readily understand that we are being invited to participate in a private experience and , by sharing it , to help in giving it as much universality as may be . It is by no means easy for readers of to-day to reverse the process , to start with the general and find in it their personal account . We are more likely to feel a resentment , or at least a prejudice , against the writer who solicits our attention to a topic without even the pretense of novelty .</p>
    <p n="8">Johnson 's generation would have found it equally hard to see the matter from our point of view , or to allow that the authors of the poems named above were being less than impudent or at best flippant in thus brazenly obtruding their private experience , undisguised , before the reader . We ought , moreover , to realize that in this judgment they would have the suffrages of all previous generations , including the greatest writers , from classical times down to their own . It is we who are singular , not they . Quite apart from considerations of moral right or wrong , of artistic good or bad , it obviously , therefore , behooves us to try to cultivate a habit of mind free from initial bias against so large a proportion of recorded testimony .</p>
    <p n="9">Very early in The Rambler Johnson remarks characteristically that “ men more frequently require to be reminded than informed . ” He believed this , and his generation believed it , because they thought that human nature changed little from age to age . The problems of conduct that confront the living individual have been faced countless times by his predecessors , and the accumulated experience of mankind has arrived at conclusions which in the main are just and therefore helpful to-day . The most important truths are those which have been known for a very long time . For that very reason they tend to be ignored or slighted unless they are restated in such a way as to arrest attention while they compel assent . Hence the best writing is that which most successfully resolves the paradox of combining the sharpest surprise with the widest recognition . Such an ideal is so difficult of attainment that , inevitably , many who subscribed to it succeeded only in unleavened platitude and others rejected it for the easier goal of novelty .</p>
    <p n="10">In this most difficult class The Vanity of Human Wishes has won a respectable place . It is freighted with a double cargo , the wisdom of two great civilizations , pagan and Christian . Although based upon Juvenal 's tenth Satire , it is so free a paraphrase as to be an original poem . The English reader who sets it against Dryden 's closer version will sense immediately its greater weight . It is informed with Johnson 's own sombre and most deeply rooted emotional responses to the meaning of experience . These , although emanating from a devout practising Christian and certainly not inconsistent with Christianity , neither reflect the specific articles of Christian doctrine nor are lightened by the happiness of Christian faith : they are strongly infused with classical resignation .</p>
    <p n="11">The poem is difficult as well as weighty . At times its expression is so condensed that the meaning must be wrestled for . Statements so packed as , for example ,</p>
    <p n="12">Fate wings with ev'ry wish th ’ afflictive dart , Each gift of nature , and each grace of art ,</p>
    <p n="13">do not yield their full intention to the running reader . One line , indeed ,— the eighth from the end ( 361 ) — has perhaps never been satisfactorily explained by any commentator . ( The eighteenth paragraph of Johnson 's first sermon might go far to clarify it . ) But such difficulties are worth the effort they demand , because there is always a rational and unesoteric solution to be gained .</p>
    <p n="14">The work as a whole has form , is shapely , even dramatic ; but it is discontinuous and episodic in its conduct , and is most memorable in its separate parts . No one can forget the magnificent “ set pieces ” of Wolsey and Charles XII ; but hardly less noteworthy are the two parallel invocations interspersed , the one addressed to the young scholar , the other to young beauties “ of rosy lips and radiant eyes ” ,— superb admonitions both , each containing such felicities of grave , compacted statement as will hardly be surpassed . The assuaging , marmoreal majesty of the concluding lines of the poem are a final demonstration of the virtue of this formal dignity in poetry . If it did not appear invidious , one would like to quote by way of contrast some lines oddly parallel , but on a pitch deliberately subdued to a less rhetorical level , from what is indubitably one of the very greatest poems written in our own century , Mr. Eliot 's Four Quartets :</p>
    <p n="15">I said to my soul , be still , and wait without hope For hope would be hope for the wrong thing ; wait without love For love would be love of the wrong thing ; there is yet faith But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting . Wait without thought , for you are not ready for thought : So the darkness shall be the light , and the stillness the dancing .</p>
    <p n="16">From The Vanity of Human Wishes :</p>
    <p n="17">Still raise for good the supplicating voice , But leave to heav'n the measure and the choice , Safe in his pow'r , whose eyes discern afar The secret ambush of a specious pray'r . Implore his aid , in his decisions rest , Secure whate'er he gives , he gives the best .... Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind , Obedient passions , and a will resign 'd ; For love , which scarce collective man can fill ; For patience sov'reign o'er transmuted ill ; For faith , that panting for a happier seat , Counts death kind Nature 's signal of retreat : These goods for man the laws of heav'n ordain , These goods he grants , who grants the pow'r to gain ; With these celestial wisdom calms the mind , And makes the happiness she does not find .</p>

   <p>Et nunc omnis Ager , nunc omnis parturit Arbos , Nunc frondent Silvae , nunc formosissimus Annus . VIRG .</p>
   <p>Every Man is sufficiently discontented with some Circumstances of his present State , to suffer his Imagination to range more or less in quest of future Happiness , and to fix upon some Point of Time , in which he shall , by the Removal of the Inconvenience which now perplexes him , or the Acquisition of Advantage which he at present wants , find his Condition of Life very much improved .</p>
   <p>When this Time , which is too often expected with great Impatience , at last arrives , it generally comes without the Blessing for which it was desired ; but we solace ourselves with some new Prospect , and press forward again with equal Eagerness .</p>
   <p>It is some Advantage to a Man , in whom this Temper prevails in any great Degree , when he turns his Hopes upon Things wholly out of his own Power , since he forbears then to precipitate his Affairs , for the Sake of the great Event that is to complete his Felicity , and waits for the blissful Hour , without neglecting such Measures as are necessary to be taken in the mean Time .</p>
   <p>I have long known a Person of this Temper , who indulged his Dream of Happiness with less Hurt to himself than such chimerical Wishes commonly produce , and adjusted his Scheme with such Address , that his Hopes were in full bloom three parts of the Year , and in the other part never wholly blasted . Many , perhaps , would be desirous of learning by what Means he procured to himself such a cheap and lasting Satisfaction . It was gained only by a constant Practice of referring the Removal of all his Uneasiness to the Coming of the next Spring . If his Affairs were disordered , he could regulate them in the Spring ; if a Regimen was prescribed him , the Spring was the proper Time of pursuing it ; if what he wanted was at a high Price , it would fall its Value in the Spring .</p>
   <p>The Spring , indeed , did often come without any of these Effects ; but he was always certain that the next would be more propitious ; and was never convinced that the present Spring would fail him until the Middle of Summer ; for he always talked of the Spring as coming ‘ till it was past , and when it was once past , every one agreed with him that it was coming .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">By long Converse with this Man , I am , perhaps , in some Degree brought to</l>
     <l n="2">feel the same immoderate Pleasure in the Contemplation of this delightful</l>
     <l n="3">Season ; but I have the Satisfaction of finding many , whom it can be no</l>
     <l n="4">Shame to resemble , infected with the same Enthusiasm ; for there is , I</l>
     <l n="5">believe , scarce any Poet of Eminence , who has not left some Testimony of</l>
     <l n="6">his Fondness for the Flowers , the Zephyrs , and the Warblers of the Spring .</l>
     <l n="7">Nor has the most luxuriant Imagination been able to describe the Serenity</l>
     <l n="8">and Happiness of the golden Age otherwise than by giving a perpetual</l>
     <l n="9">Spring , as the highest Reward of uncorrupted Innocence .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There is , indeed , something inexpressibly pleasing in the annual Renovation of the World , and the new Display of the Treasures of Nature . The Cold and Darkness of Winter , with the naked Deformity of every Object on which we turn our Eyes , makes us necessarily rejoice at the succeeding Season , as well for what we have escaped , as for what we may enjoy ; and every budding Flower , which a warm Situation brings early to our View , is considered by us as a Messenger , to inform us of the Approach of more joyous Days .</p>
   <p>The Spring affords to a Mind , so free from the Disturbance of Cares or Passions as to be vacant to calm Amusements , almost every Thing that our present State makes us capable of enjoying . The variegated Verdure of the Fields and Woods , the Succession of grateful Odours , the Voice of Pleasure pouring out its Notes on every Side , with the Observation of the Gladness apparently conceived by every Animal , from the Growth of his Food , and the Clemency of the Weather , throw over the whole Earth an Air of Gayety , which is very significantly expressed by the Smile of Nature .</p>
   <p>There are Men to whom these Scenes are able to give no Delight , and who hurry away from all the Varieties of rural Beauty , to lose their Hours , and divert their Thoughts by Cards , or publick Assemblies , a Tavern Dinner , or the Prattle of the Day .</p>
   <p>It may be laid down as a Position which will seldom deceive , that when a Man cannot bear his own Company there is something wrong . He must fly from himself , either because he feels a Tediousness in Life from the Equipoise of an empty Mind , which , having no Tendency to one Motion more than another but as it is impelled by some external Power , must always have recourse to foreign Objects ; or he must be afraid of the Intrusion of some unpleasing Ideas , and , perhaps , is always struggling to escape from the Remembrance of a Loss , the Fear of a Calamity , or some other Thought of greater Horror .</p>
   <p>Those , who are incapacitated to enjoy the Pleasures of Contemplation , by their Griefs , may , very properly , apply to such Diversions , provided they are innocent , as lay strong hold on the Attention ; and those , whom Fear of any future Calamity chains down to Misery , must endeavour to obviate the Danger .</p>
   <p>My Considerations shall , on this Occasion , be turned on such as are burthensome to themselves merely because they want Subjects for Reflection , and to whom the Volume of Nature is thrown open without affording them Pleasure or Instruction , because they never learned to read the Characters .</p>
   <p>A French Author has advanced this seeming Paradox , that very few Men know how to take a Walk ; and , indeed , it is very true , that few Men know how to take a Walk with a Prospect of any other Pleasure , than the same Company would have afforded them in any other Circumstances .</p>
   <p>There are Animals that borrow their Colour from the neighbouring Body , and , consequently , vary their Hue as they happen to change their Place . In like manner it ought to be the Endeavour of every Man to derive his Reflexions from the Objects about him ; for it is to no purpose that he alters his Position , if his Attention continues fixt to the same Point . The Mind should be kept open to the Access of every new Idea , and so far disengaged from the Predominance of particular Thoughts , as to be able to accommodate itself to emergent Occasions , and remark every Thing that offers itself to present Examination .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">A Man that has formed this Habit of turning every new Object to his</l>
     <l n="2">Entertainment , finds in the Productions of Nature an inexhaustible Stock</l>
     <l n="3">of Materials , upon which he can employ himself , without any Temptations to</l>
     <l n="4">Envy or Malevolence ; Faults , perhaps , seldom totally avoided by those ,</l>
     <l n="5">whose Judgment is much exercised upon the Works of Art . He has always a</l>
     <l n="6">certain Prospect of discovering new Reasons for adoring the Sovereign</l>
     <l n="7">Author of the Universe , and probable Hopes of making some Discovery of</l>
     <l n="8">Benefit to others , or of Profit to himself . There is no doubt but many</l>
     <l n="9">Vegetables and Animals have Qualities that might be of great Use ; to the</l>
     <l n="10">Knowledge of which there is required no great Sagacity of Penetration , or</l>
     <l n="11">Fatigue of Study , but only frequent Experiments , and close Attention . What</l>
     <l n="12">is said by the Chymists of their darling Mercury , is , perhaps , true of</l>
     <l n="13">every Body through the whole Creation , that , if a thousand Lives should be</l>
     <l n="14">spent upon it , all its Properties would not be found out .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Mankind must necessarily be diversified by various Tastes , since Life affords and requires such multiplicity of Employments ; and a Nation of Naturalists is neither to be hoped , or desired , but it is surely not improper to point out a fresh Amusement to those who langush in Health , and repine in Plenty , for want of some Source of Diversion that may be less easily exhausted , and to inform the Multitudes of both Sexes , who are burthened with every new Day , that there are many Shews which they have not seen .</p>
   <p>He that enlarges his Curiosity after the Works of Nature , demonstrably multiplies the Inlets to Happiness , and , therefore , the younger Part of my Readers , to whom I dedicate this vernal Speculation , must excuse me for calling upon them to make use at once of the Spring of the Year , and the Spring of Life ; to acquire , while their Minds may be yet impressed with new Images , a Love of innocent Pleasures , and an ardour for useful Knowledge ; and to remember , that a blighted Spring makes a barren Year , and that the vernal Flowers , however beautiful and gay , are only intended by Nature as Preparatives to Autumnal Fruits .</p>

     <l n="4">— Quid fit pulchrum , quid turpe , quid utile , quid non ,</l>
     <l n="5">Plenius et melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit . HOR .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="6">All Joy or Sorrow for the Happiness or Calamities of others is produced by</l>
     <l n="7">an Act of the Imagination , that realises the Event however fictitious , or</l>
     <l n="8">approximates it however remote , by placing us , for a Time , in the</l>
     <l n="9">Condition of him whose Fortune we contemplate ; so that we feel , while the</l>
     <l n="10">Deception lasts , whatever Motions would be excited by the same Good or</l>
     <l n="11">Evil happening to ourselves .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Our Passions are therefore more strongly moved , in proportion as we can more readily adopt the Pains or Pleasures proposed to our Minds , by recognising them as once our own , or considering them as naturally incident to our State of Life . It is not easy for the most artful Writer to give us an Interest in Happiness or Misery , which we think ourselves never likely to feel , and with which we have never yet been made acquainted . Histories of the Downfall of Kingdoms , and Revolutions of Empires are read with great Tranquillity ; the imperial Tragedy pleases common Auditors only by its Pomp of Ornament , and Grandeur of Ideas ; and the Man whose Faculties have been engrossed by Business , and whose Heart never fluttered but at the Rise or Fall of Stocks , wonders how the Attention can be seized , or the Affections agitated by a Tale of Love .</p>
   <p>Those parallel Circumstances , and kindred Images to which we readily conform our Minds , are , above all other Writings , to be found in Narratives of the Lives of particular Persons ; and there seems therefore no Species of Writing more worthy of Cultivation than Biography , since none can be more delightful , or more useful , none can more certainly enchain the Heart by irresistible Interest , or more widely diffuse Instruction to every Diversity of Condition .</p>
   <p>The general and rapid Narratives of History , which involve a thousand Fortunes in the Business of a Day , and complicate innumerable Incidents in one great Transaction , afford few Lessons applicable to private Life , which derives its Comforts and its Wretchedness from the right or wrong Management of Things that nothing but their Frequency makes considerable , Parva si non fiunt quotidie , says Pliny , and which can have no Place in those Relations which never descend below the Consultation of Senates , the Motions of Armies , and the Schemes of Conspirators .</p>
   <p>I have often thought that there has rarely passed a Life of which a judicious and faithful Narrative would not be useful . For , not only every Man has in the mighty Mass of the World great Numbers in the same Condition with himself , to whom his Mistakes and Miscarriages , Escapes and Expedients would be of immediate and apparent Use ; but there is such an Uniformity in the Life of Man , if it be considered apart from adventitious and separable Decorations and Disguises , that there is scarce any Possibility of Good or Ill , but is common to Humankind . A great Part of the Time of those who are placed at the greatest Distance by Fortune , or by Temper , must unavoidably pass in the same Manner ; and though , when the Claims of Nature are satisfied , Caprice , and Vanity , and Accident , begin to produce Discriminations , and Peculiarities , yet the Eye is not very heedful , or quick , which cannot discover the same Causes still terminating their Influence in the same Effects , though sometimes accelerated , sometimes retarded , or perplexed by multiplied Combinations . We are all prompted by the same Motives , all deceived by the same Fallacies , all animated by Hope , obstructed by Danger , entangled by Desire , and seduced by Pleasure .</p>
   <p>It is frequently objected to Relations of particular Lives , that they are not distinguished by any striking or wonderful Vicissitude . The Scholar who passes his Life among his Books , the Merchant who conducted only his own Affairs , the Priest whose Sphere of Action was not extended beyond that of his Duty , are considered as no proper Objects of publick Regard , however they might have excelled in their several Stations , whatever might have been their Learning , Integrity , and Piety . But this Notion arises from false Measures of Excellence and Dignity , and must be eradicated by considering , that , in the Eye of uncorrupted Reason , what is of most Use is of most Value .</p>
   <p>It is , indeed , not improper to take honest Advantages of Prejudice , and to gain Attention by a great Name ; but the Business of the Biographer is often to pass slightly over those Performances and Incidents , which produce vulgar Greatness , to lead the Thoughts into domestick Privacies , and display the minute Details of daily Life , where exterior Appendages are cast aside , and Men excel each other only by Prudence , and by Virtue . The Life of Thuanus is , with great Propriety , said by its Author to have been written , that it might lay open to Posterity the private and familiar Character of that Man , cujus Ingenium et Candorem ex ipsius Scriptis sunt olim simper miraturi , whose Candour and Genius his Writings will to the End of Time preserve in Admiration .</p>
   <p>There are many invisible Circumstances , which whether we read as Enquirers after natural or moral Knowledge , whether we intend to enlarge our Science , or encrease our Virtue , are more important than publick Occurrences . Thus Salust , the great Master , has not forgot , in his Account of Catiline , to remark that his Walk was now quick , and again slow , as an Indication of a Mind revolving something with violent Commotion . Thus the Story of Melancthon affords a striking Lecture on the Value of Time , by informing us that when he made an Appointment , he expected not only the Hour , but the Minute to be fixed , that Life might not run out in the Idleness of Suspense ; and all the Plans and Enterprizes of De Wit are now of less Importance to the World , than that Part of his personal Character which represents him as careful of his Health , and negligent of his Life .</p>
   <p>But Biography has often been allotted to Writers who seem very little acquainted with the Nature of their Task , or very negligent about the Performance . They rarely afford any other Account than might be collected from publick Papers , and imagine themselves writing a Life when they exhibit a chronological Series of Actions or Preferments ; and so little regard the Manners or Behaviour of their Heroes , that more Knowledge may be gained of a Man 's real Character , by a short Conversation with one of his Servants , than from a formal and studied Narrative , begun with his Pedigree , and ended with his Funeral .</p>
   <p>If now and then they condescend to inform the World of particular Facts , they are not always so happy as to select those which are of most Importance . I know not well what Advantage Posterity can receive from the only Circumstance by which Tickell has distinguished Addison from the Rest of Mankind , the Irregularity of his Pulse : nor can I think myself overpaid for the Time spent in reading the Life of Malherb , by being enabled to relate , after the learned Biographer , that Malherb had two predominant Opinions ; one , that the Looseness of a single Woman might destroy all the Boast of ancient Descent ; the other , that the French Beggers made use very improperly and barbarously of the Phrase noble Gentleman , because either Word included the Sense of both .</p>
   <p>There are , indeed , some natural Reasons why these Narratives are often written by such as were not likely to give much Instruction or Delight , and why most Accounts of particular Persons are barren and useless . If a Life be delayed till all Interest and Envy are at an End , and all Motives to Calumny or Flattery are suppressed , we may hope for Impartiality , but must expect little Intelligence ; for the Incidents which give Excellence to Biography are of a volatile and evanescent Kind , such as soon escape the Memory , and are rarely transmitted by Tradition . We know how few can portray a living Acquaintance , except by his most prominent and observable Particularities , and the grosser Features of his Mind ; and it may be easily imagined how much of this little Knowledge may be lost in imparting it , and how soon a Succession of Copies will lose all Resemblance of the Original .</p>
   <p>If the Biographer writes from personal Knowledge , and makes haste to gratify the publick Curiosity , there is Danger left his Interest , his Fear , his Gratitude , or his Tenderness , overpower his Fidelity , and tempt him to conceal , if not to invent . There are many who think it an Act of Piety to hide the Faults or Failings of their Friends , even when they can no longer suffer by their Detection ; we therefore see whole Ranks of Characters adorned with uniform Panegyrick , and not to be known from one another , but by extrinsick and casual Circumstances . “ Let me remember , says Hale , when I find myself inclined to pity a Criminal , that there is likewise a Pity due to the Country . ” If there is a Regard due to the Memory of the Dead , there is yet more Respect to be paid to Knowledge , to Virtue , and to Truth .</p>
