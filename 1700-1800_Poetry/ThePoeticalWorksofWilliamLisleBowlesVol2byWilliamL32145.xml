   <p>MEMOIR AND CRITICISM ON THE WORKS OF THE REV . W. L. BOWLES .</p>
   <p>The poetry of each age may be considered as vitally connected with , and as vividly reflective of , its character and progress , as either its politics or its religion . You see the nature of the soil of a garden in its tulips and roses , as much as in its pot-herbs and its towering trees . We purpose , accordingly , to compare briefly the poetry of the past and of the present centuries , as indices of some of the points of contrast between the two , and to show also how , and through what causes , the one grew into the other . This will be a fitting introduction to a consideration of the life and writings of the first of the poets of this century included in our series , the more as he was in a measure the father of modern poetry .</p>
   <p>It is impossible to take up a volume of the poetry of the eighteenth century , such as , for instance , Churchill 's , or Pope 's , or Johnson 's , and to compare it with some of the leading poetical works of the present , such as the poems of Wordsworth , Coleridge , Shelley , and Byron , and not to feel as if you were reading the productions of two different races of beings — so different are the style , the sentiments , the modes of thought , the imagery , the temperament , and the spirit of the poets and the poetry . It is like stepping , we will not say from the frigid , but from the temperate into the torrid zone . In the one class of authors you find the prevalence of strong sense , flanked by wit and by fancy , but without much that can be called imaginative or romantic . In the other , imagination or fancy is the regnant faculty ; and if wit and sense are there too , they are there as slaves , the “ Slaves of the lamp , ” to the imperious imaginative power . The style of the one is clear , masculine , sententious , and measured ; that of the other is bold , unmeasured , diffuse , fervid , and sometimes obscure . The one style may be compared to a clear crescent ; the other to a full , but partially eclipsed , moon . The sentiment of the one is chiefly the sublimation of passion : bitter contempt , noble indignation , a proud , stern patriotism , sometimes united with a sombre , but manly melancholy , are the principal feelings expressed ; that of the other , although occasionally morbid , is far more varied , more profound , purer , on the whole , and more poetical . The thought of the one is acute and logical ; that of the other aspires to the deep , if not to the mystical and the transcendental . The subjects of the poets of the eighteenth century are generally of a dignified cast ( except in the case of satirical productions ) , such as “ The Temple of Fame , ” “ The Pleasures of Imagination , ” “ The Traveller , ” “ London , ” and “ The Vanity of Human Wishes . ” The subjects of the other class are as varied as their mode of treatment is often daringly peculiar . The leech-gatherer on his lonely moor , the pedlar on his humble rounds , the tinker linked by a “ fellow-feeling ” to the animal he beats and starves , a mad mariner , a divorced wife , a wandering roue — such characters as these have called forth the utmost stretch of the powers of our best modern poets . The images of the former race of poets are limited to what are called classical subjects — including in this term the ancient mythologies , the incidents in Grecian and Roman story , the more beautiful objects of nature , and the more popular productions of art . Those of modern poets acknowledge no boundary — from the firmament to the fungus , from Niagara to the nearest puddle , from the cold scalp of Mont Blanc to the snowball of the schoolboy — all things are free and open to the step of their genius , which , like the moonbeam , touches and beautifies every object on which it rests . The temperament of the two races is as distinct as their sentiment and style ; that of the one seeming somewhat curbed , if not cold , while that of the other is ardent always , and often enthusiastic and rapturous . Different also their spirit ; the one being confined and sectarian , alike in politics , in literature , and in religion ; the other , in some of their number , being liberal to latitudinarianism , and genial to a vice .</p>
   <p>We are not at present seeking to settle the precedence of these two schools of poetry . We love and honour much in both , and think the criticism small and captious which can be blind to the peculiar merits of either — to the terseness , condensation , force of single lines , vigour of logical thought , and general correctness of the one ; or to the boldness , brilliant diffusion , breadth , and variety of mood and music , of subject and of treatment , which distinguish the other . It is more specially our object at present to show how each sprang naturally and inevitably out of the different ages when they appeared .</p>
   <p>Poetry is an age in flower ; and the poetry of the nineteenth century has been a more gorgeous and more tropical flower , because warmer suns have shone on it , warmer winds blown on it , and larger rains watered its roots . Indeed , it is almost a wonder that the first half , at least , and the middle of the eighteenth century , produced so much and such good poetry . That age was , on the whole , a stagnant and uninteresting one . There was nothing very deeply to rouse the passions and imaginations of men . There was , indeed , the usual amount of political squabbles ; but when a Bolingbroke was the most eloquent and admired of parliamentary orators , what moral grandeur could be expected ? There was a Jacobite faction , perpetually undermining and sometimes breaking out into open rebellion ; but their enthusiasm , save in Scotland , was mingled with no poetical elements , although there certainly it produced many exquisite strains of ballad poetry . Twice or thrice the popular passions broke forth , and reared up an idol for themselves in the shape of a private man , exalted for the nonce into a hero ; but it is significant to remember that the two principal of these idols were calves — Sacheverel , namely , and Jack Wilkes . The wars in that age were almost entirely destitute of imaginative interest ; those of Marlborough , such as Blenheim and Ramilies , were just large games of chess , played on a blood-red board — who now ever thinks or talks about the battles of Fontenoy or Minden ?— some tolerable sea-fights , indeed , there were ; on the heights of Abraham a brave man expired in the arms of victory , and a glory still lingers on the field of Prestonpans and on the bloody plains of Culloden ; but there was no Trafalgar , no Waterloo , and no Inkermann . The manners of the age were not only dissolute , but grossly and brutally so . In England , there was no Burns to cast a gleam of poetry even on the orgies of dissipation ; all was as coarse as it was corrupt ; it was a drunken dance of naked satyrs : and disgust at this state of things , we believe , principally made Burke , contrasting the Continent with England , to utter the paradox , that vice , by losing all its grossness , lost half its evil . Foreigners were then , as they are still , more depraved in morals and filthier in personal habits than we ; but they had , and have , a grace , a politeness , a reticence , and an ease , which gilded , if they did not lessen , the abominations . The religion of the country was reduced to a very low point of depression ; the churches were filled with drowsy divines , drowsily reading what they never wrote , to yet drowsier congregations ; many of the upper classes , and of the literary men , were avowed infidels ; till the rise of Methodism , religious enthusiasm in any class did not exist — even in Scotland the load of patronage had nearly extinguished the old fires of Covenanting zeal — the state of the lower classes was deplorable , so far , at least , as mental culture and morality were concerned ; cock-fighting , grinning through collars , bull-baiting , and hard drinking , were their main amusements ; the hallowing and spiritualising influences of the Sabbath-day were scarcely known ; and the upper ranks had no feeling that they were in some measure responsible for the ignorance and the vice of the lower , and were bound to circulate education and religion amidst their masses ; indeed , how could they be expected , since they themselves had little education and less religion to circulate ? In science , philosophy , and general literature , there prevailed a partial syncope and pause . Newton was dead , and had left no successor ; Locke was dead , and had left no successor . The wits of Queen Anne 's reign , Swift , Pope , Arbuthnot , Steele , and Addison , were dropping off one by one , and for a season none arose adequate to supply their place . It had altogether become an age of mediocrity ; neither an age of stern conflict , like that of the Puritans , nor even a fiercely lawless and riotous age , like that of Charles the Second , nor a transition age , like that of the Revolution , but an age of a negative and slumbrous character ; its only positive qualities were a generally diffused laxity of principle and corruption of practice ; but its vices , as well as its virtues , were small ; it had not virtue to be greatly good , nor daring to be greatly wicked .</p>
   <p>All this told on its poetry ; and our wonder , we repeat , is , that it did not tell more . That it did not , was probably owing to the continued prevalence of the power of classical literature . That , increased by the influence of the universities and the great schools , and by the translations made of its masterpieces by Dryden and Pope , contributed to produce and maintain purity of taste , in the midst of general depravation of manners , and to touch many opening minds with the chaste and manly inspiration of a long past age . Hence the poetry of the first half of the eighteenth century , while inferior in force and richness to that of the end of the seventeenth , is superior in good taste , and is much freer from impurities . To this the imitation of French models , too , contributed . Still we see the traces of the period very distinctly marked in its works of art and in its poetry . The paintings of Hogarth , next to the infinite richness of the painter 's invention , and the accuracy of his observation and touch , testify to the corruption of these times . They are everlasting libels — as true , however , as they are libellous — on the age of the first two Georges ; and we are astonished how such an age produced such a genius , as well as grieved to see how such a genius had no better materials to work on than were furnished by such an age . It is much the same with the novels of Smollett and Fielding , and with parts of the poetry of Churchill , Lloyd , and others . The formal wars of that day , too , were certain to produce formal poetry , and Blenheim was fitly celebrated in Addison 's “ Campaign . ” The sceptical philosophy then prevalent was faithfully mirrored in Pope 's “ Essay on Man , ” which , exquisite as a work of art , is , in thought , a system of naturalism set to music ; and , while its art is the poet 's own , its doctrine comes from the “ fell genius ” of St John ( Bolingbroke ) . Up to Thomson 's fine “ Ode on the Death of Sir Isaac Newton , ” and the “ Night Thoughts , ” the great discoveries of astronomy obtained no poetical recognition . Religious poetry , properly speaking , there was none ; for the hymns of Watts , although full of piety , can scarcely be called poems ; and the most popular poetry of the time was either founded on the Latin , or written in imitation of Pope . Johnson 's “ London ” and “ Vanity of Human Wishes ” are instances of the former ; and of the latter , specimens too numerous to mention abounded .</p>
   <p>Thus it continued till about the middle of the century , when there began to appear symptoms of a change . First of all , a “ fine fat fellow ” from Scotland , who had derived inspiration from the breezes of the Tweed and the Jed , wrote that noble strain , “ The Seasons , ” with its daguerreotypic painting of nature , and its generous , healthy enthusiasm , and the “ Castle of Indolence , ” with its exquisite sketches of character and scenery , and its rich reproduction of an antique style of poetry . Thomson 's voice did not , indeed , produce a revolution in taste , but it obtained an audience for a species of writing entirely different from what then prevailed . Young , next , in a bolder spirit , having broken the trammels of Pope , which had confined him , soared up through Night and all its worlds , and brought down genuine inspiration on his adventurous wing . Dr Johnson , although considerably hampered in his verse by undue admiration of the mechanical poets , allowed himself greater liberty in his prose , which glowed with a deep , if somewhat turbid life , and rolled on in a strong and solemn current , which often seemed that of high imagination . Collins , smitten with a true “ gadfly , ” born as one out of due time , and , alas ! “ blasted with the celestial fire , ” he brought , anticipated , in part , some of the miraculous effects of more modern poetry . Gray , Mason , and Beattie , three men of unequal name , all wrote in a different style from Addison , Swift , and Pope , and two of them displayed genuine , if not very powerful , genius . Then came Percy , with his “ Reliques of Ancient Poetry , ” which showed what wonders our rude forefathers had wrought by the force of simple nature ; and to the same end contributed Ossian 's Poems , which , whatever their defects , awakened and startled the literary world , here , in France , and in Germany , by a panoramic view of that “ land of mountain and of flood , ” which was yet to attract so many visitors , and to inspire so many bards . The impulse lent to our prose style by Johnson was followed up by Junius and by Burke , both of whom shot into the discussions of politics and of passing events much of the spirit and the power of poetry . Burke especially , even before the French Revolution effectually roused the world , had given specimens of fervid prose , combining with matter of fact and the most compact wisdom , the graces , the spirit , the imagery , and the language of the highest imagination . Cowper , too , had come , setting religion to rhythm ; and , although “ veiling all the lightnings of his song in sorrow , ” yet circulating the power of his genius , even more extensively than the contagion of his grief . Burns , in Scotland , had exhibited his vein of ardent native genius . And lastly , the French Revolution lifted up its volcano voice , and said to the world of literature and song , as well as to the world at large , “ Sleep no more . ”</p>
   <p>From this date the character of poetry was changed , and began to assume that antagonistic attitude to the school of Dryden and Pope which we described in our commencing remarks , and which yet continues . Britain got engaged in a Titanic warfare , an earthshaking contest — a war of opinion , not of treaties — of peoples , not of kings ; and instead of “ Campaigns , ” our poets indited Odes to France , to the Departing Year , hymns to “ Carnage , God 's Daughter , ” and “ Visions of Don Roderick . ” Our religion became more intense and earnest , and this produced , on the one hand , the fine religious verses of a Montgomery , the poetical prose of a Foster and a Hall , and the rapt effusions of a Coleridge and Wordsworth ; and , on the other hand , told even on our scepticism , which became more impassioned too , and wielded against religion a bar of burning iron , like “ Queen Mab , ” instead of a piece of polished wood , like the “ Essay on Man . ” Our morality improved , in outward decorum , at least , and the last remains of the indecency of former times were swept away — to re-appear , indeed , afterwards partially in “ Don Juan . ” Poetry , too , after coquetting for a little , not very gracefully , with Science in Darwin 's “ Botanic Garden , ” and “ Temple of Nature , ” aspired to the hand of Philosophy ; and the Lake poets and others not merely found a poetic worship in nature , but set to song many of the wondrous speculations of modern psychology . A taste for ancient , simple poetic writers spread widely , and produced Scott 's brilliant imitations of ballad poetry , and Wordsworth 's early lyrical strains . Popular principles began to prevail , and knowledge to circulate among the lower classes ; and they learned not only to read poems with relish , but their “ poor dumb mouths ” ever and anon were opened to utter a stern and vigorous poetry of their own . Along with these and other beneficial changes , there were , indeed , much extravagance and exaggeration introduced . With the formality and stiffness , much of the point , pith , and correctness of the old school was lost — a good deal of false enthusiasm and pretence , mingled with the real inspiration ; jackdaws and mocking-birds , as well as doves and eagles , abounded . But , on the whole , we question if any age of the world has equalled the early part of the nineteenth century , in the quantity , or in the quality , in the power , depth , brilliance , or variety of its poetry .</p>
   <p>WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES — whom we have ventured to call the father of modern poetry , since not only was he first in the field , but since his sonnets inspired the more powerful muse of Coleridge — was descended from an ancient and respectable family in Wiltshire . His grandfather and father were both clergymen in the Church of England . The poet was born in King 's Sutton , and baptized there on the 25th of September 1762 . In the year 1776 he was placed on the Wykeham foundation at Winchester . His master was Dr Joseph Warton , who , seeing genius disguised under the veil of his pupil 's boyish timidity , encouraged him in his efforts , was warmly loved by Bowles in return , and transmitted to him his very moderate estimate of the poetry and character of Pope . Bowles has testified his gratitude to his teacher in his very pleasing “ Monody on the Death of Dr Warton . ” During the last year he passed at Winchester , Bowles was captain of the school . In the year 1781 , he was elected a scholar of Trinity College , Oxford , having selected this college , because the brother of his old master , Thomas Warton , was residing there . In 1783 , he gained the Chancellor 's prize for Latin verse — “ Calpe Obessa ; or , The Siege of Gibraltar , ” being the subject of the poem . At college he got no fellowship , nor did he procure his degree till 1792 . At an early age , he is said to have been unsuccessful in his suit to a Miss Romilly , a niece of Sir Samuel Romilly ; and this rejection it was which first stung him into rhyme and rambling ; for , in order to deaden his feelings , he traversed the north of England , Scotland , and parts of the Continent . His first production consisted of fourteen sonnets , published in 1789 , and was followed the same year by “ Verses to John Howard . ” In 1790 , he reprinted these and various other pieces written in the interval , and in 1798 they were reproduced with illustrations . They became so popular , that by the year 1805 they had reached a ninth edition .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Almost every year from 1798 till the end of his life , Mr Bowles was</l>
     <l n="2">adding to his works new poems of various merit . In 1798 , appeared his</l>
     <l n="3">“ Coombe Ellen , and St Michael 's Mount ; ” in 1799 , “ The Battle of the</l>
     <l n="4">Nile ; ” in 1801 , “ The Sorrows of Switzerland ; ” in 1803 , “ The Picture ; ” in</l>
     <l n="5">1805 , the “ Spirit of Discovery ; ” in 1806 , “ Bowden Hill ; ” in 1815 , “ The</l>
     <l n="6">Missionary of the Andes ; ” in 1822 , “ The Grave of the Last Saxon ; ” in</l>
     <l n="7">1823 , “ Ellen Gray ; ” in 1828 , “ Days Departed ; ” in 1833 , “ St John in</l>
     <l n="8">Patmos ; ” and in 1837 , a volume entitled “ Scenes and Shadows of Days</l>
     <l n="9">Departed , a Narrative ; ” besides “ The Village Verse-book , ” a very popular</l>
     <l n="10">selection of simple poetry .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The events of this gentleman 's private and professional life were of no particular interest . Having entered holy orders , he resided for many years as curate in Donhead St Andrew , in Wilts , where he remained till 1804 , when he was appointed vicar of Bremhill — a situation which he continued to fill till the end of his long life . In 1792 , he was presented to the vicarage of Checklade , in Wiltshire , which he resigned , after an incumbency of five years , on receiving another presentation to the rectory of Dumbleton , Gloucestershire . This living he retained till his death , although he never resided at either Dumbleton or Checklade . In 1804 , through Archbishop Moore , he was made vicar of Bremhill , and , the same year , prebend of Stratford in the cathedral church of Salisbury . In 1828 , he was elected canon-residentiary . He had , in 1818 , been appointed chaplain to the Prince Regent . He resided constantly at Bremhill for twenty-five years . After he was elected canon , however , he abode partly , and in the latter years of his life principally , in the town of Salisbury . In 1797 , he married Magdalene , daughter of the Rev . Charles Wake , D. D ., prebendary of Westminster , and grand-daughter of Archbishop Wake . She died some years before her husband , and left no family . Bowles himself expired at Salisbury , after a gradual decay of the vital powers , April 7 , 1850 , aged eighty-eight years . His life is about to be written at large by his kinsman , Dr J. Bowles , assisted by Mr Alaric Watts , to whom the publisher is indebted for the means of supplying a complete copyright edition of the poet 's works .</p>
   <p>Bowles was a diligent pastor , an eloquent preacher , an active justice , and in every way an estimable man . Even Byron , who met him at Mr Rogers ’ , in London , speaks of him as a “ pleasant , gentlemanly man — a good fellow for a parson . ” Moore , in his Diary , speaks with delight of his mixture of talent and simplicity . In his introduction to “ Scenes and Shadows , ” Bowles gives some interesting particulars of his early life . In Blackwood , for August 1828 , there is a very entertaining account of Bremhill Parsonage .</p>
   <p>As an author , he appears in three aspects — as a writer on typography , as an editor and controversialist , and as a poet . In 1828 , he produced a volume entitled “ The Parochial History of Bremhill , ” and shortly afterwards , his “ History of Lacock Abbey , ” containing much interesting antiquarian lore . To this succeeded a still more ingenious and recondite work , entitled “ Hermes Britannicus , ” besides some less important writings of a similar kind . His “ Life of Bishop Ken , ” which appeared in 1830 and 1831 , might be considered as belonging to the same category of learned antiquarian lucubrations .</p>
   <p>In 1807 , he published an edition of Pope , in ten volumes , for which he received L300 . The life prefixed to this edition led to the celebrated controversy between Bowles , on the one hand , and Campbell , Byron , Roscoe , Octavius Gilchrist , and the Quarterly Review , on the other . In our life of Pope , we hope to devote a few pages to the principal questions which were mooted in this controversy . We may simply say , at present , that we think Bowles was , in the main , right , although he laid himself open to retort at many points , and displayed an animus against Pope , both as a man and a poet , which he in vain sought to disclaim , and which somewhat detracted from the value of his criticisms . He gained , however , the three objects at which he aimed :— he proved that Pope was only at the head of the second rank of poets — that , as a man , he was guilty of many meannesses , and had a prurient imagination and pen — and that the objects of artificial life are , per se , less fitted for the purposes of poetry than those of nature , and than the passions of the human heart . In this controversy , as well as in some after-skirmishes ,— in his letters to Lord Brougham , “ On the Position and Incomes of the Cathedral Clergy , ” — in a letter to Sir James Mackintosh , on the Increase of Crime ,— and in a sharp fight with the Rev . Edward Duke , F. S. A ., on the Antiquities of Wiltshire — Bowles displayed amazing PLUCK , and no small controversial acuteness and dexterity . Like another Ajax , he took enemy after enemy on his single shield , and by his pertinacity and perseverance , he succeeded in beating them all . He stood at first alone , and had very formidable opponents . But he bated not one jot of heart or hope ; and , by and by , Southey , Blackwood 's Magazine , and others , came to his aid , and , finally , William Hazlitt saw , with his inevitable eye , the real merits of the case , and ( substantially inclining to the Bowles side ) settled , by a paper in the London Magazine , the question for ever . As a controversialist , Bowles is rather noisy , flippant , and fierce ; and his reply to Byron , while superior to the noble bard 's letter in argument , is far inferior in easy and trenchant vigour of style . His writings on the Pope controversy consist of “ A Letter to Thomas Campbell , ” “ Two Letters to Lord Byron , ” “ A Final Appeal to the Public relative to Pope , ” and ( more last words ! ) , “ Lessons in Criticism to William Roscoe , and Farther Lessons to a Quarterly Reviewer . ” All are exceedingly readable and clever .</p>
   <p>It is curious contrasting the spirit of Bowles ’ prose — his severity — his pugnacity — his irritability , with the mild qualities of his poetry . The leading element in all his poetical works is sentiment ,— warm , mellow , tender , and often melancholy sentiment . He has no profound thought — no powerful pictures of passion — no creative imagination — but over all his poetry lies a sweet autumnal moonlight of pensive and gentle feeling . In his larger poems , he is often diffuse and verbose , and you see more effort than energy . But in his smaller , and especially in his sonnets , and his pieces descriptive of nature , Bowles is always true to his own heart , and therefore always successful . How delightful such sonnets as his “ Morning Bells , ” “ Absence , ” “ Bereavement , ” and his poems entitled , “ Monody at Matlock , ” “ Coombe-Ellen , ” “ On Hearing the ‘ Messiah , ’ ” etc .! We trust that many , after reading these and the others ( some of which were never before published ) contained in our volumes , will be ready to express the gratitude of their hearts through the medium of the following beautiful sonnet :—</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>“ SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE TO WILLIAM LISLE BOWLES .</head>
     <l n="1">“ My heart has thanked thee , Bowles ! for those soft strains ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose sadness soothes me like the murmuring</l>
     <l n="3">Of wild bees in the sunny showers of spring !</l>
     <l n="4">For hence , not callous to the mourner 's pains ,</l>
     <l n="5">Through youth 's gay prime and thornless paths I went :</l>
     <l n="6">And when the mightier throes of mind began ,</l>
     <l n="7">And drove me forth a thought-bewildered man ,</l>
     <l n="8">Their mild and manliest melancholy lent</l>
     <l n="9">A mingled charm , such as the pang consigned</l>
     <l n="10">To slumber , though the big tear it renewed ;</l>
     <l n="11">Bidding a strange mysterious pleasure brood</l>
     <l n="12">Over the wavy and tumultuous mind ,</l>
     <l n="13">As the Great Spirit erst with plastic sweep</l>
     <l n="14">Moved on the darkness of the unformed deep . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>His larger poems are perhaps more distinguished by the ambition of their themes than by the success of their treatment . His particular theory about the superiority of the works of nature as poetical subjects perhaps led him to a too uniform selection of its grander features , while undoubtedly his genius fitted him better for depicting its softer and smaller objects . He excels far more in interpreting the language of the bells , now of Ostend , and now of Oxford — in describing the dingles of Coombe Ellen — in echoing the fall of the river Avon , heard in his sick-chamber at Bath — or in catching on his mind-mirror the “ Distant View of England from the Sea ” — than in coping with the dark recesses of the American forest , following the daring Gama round his Cape of Storms , standing with Noah on the brow of the tremendous mountain Caff , the hill of demons and griffins , and seeing the globe at his feet , or in walking beside the Seer of all time , in that “ isle which is called Patmos , ”</p>
   <p>“ Placed far amid the melancholy main . ”</p>
   <p>He is more at home in the beautiful than in the sublime — more a Warton than a Milton — and may be rather likened to a bee murmuring her dim music in the bells of flowers , than to an eagle dallying with the tempest , and binding distant oceans and chains of mountains together by the living link of his swift and strong pinion . Yet his “ Spirit of Discovery ” contains some bold fancy . Take this , for instance :—</p>

   <p>contains much vivid description and interesting narrative ; and “ St John in Patmos , ” if scarcely up to the mark of the transcendent theme , has a good deal of picturesque and striking poetry . Perhaps the most interesting of all his minor poems is that entitled “ Childe Harold 's Last Pilgrimage , ” quoted , we remember , in Moore 's Life of Byron . As proceeding from one whom the angry and unhappy Childe had often insulted in public and laughed at in private , it was as graceful in spirit as it is elegant in composition . “ Revenge , ” it has been said , “ is a feast for the gods ; ” and the saying is true if meant of that species of revenge which gains its end by forgiveness . An act so noble and generous as the writing of this , is calculated to set the memory of Bowles still higher than all his poetry .</p>

   <p>BANWELL HILL ;</p>
   <p>A LAY OF THE SEVERN SEA .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .<span corresp="#note1" type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></p>
   <p>The estimation of a Poem of this nature must depend , first , on its arrangement , plan , and disposition ; secondly , on the judgment , propriety , and feeling with which — in just and proper succession and relief — picture , pathos , moral and religious reflections , historical notices , or affecting incidents , are interwoven . The reader will , in the next place , attend to the versification , or music , in which the thoughts are conveyed . Shakspeare and Milton are the great masters of the verse I have adopted . But who can be heard after them ? The reader , however , will at least find no specimens of sonorous harmony ending with such significant words as “ of , ” “ and , ” “ if , ” “ but , ” etc of which we have had lately some splendid examples . I would therefore only request of him to observe , that when such passages occur in this poem as “ vanishing , ” “ hush ! ” etc . it was from design , and not from want of ear .<span corresp="#note2" type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></p>
   <p>An intermixture of images and characters from common life might be thought , at first sight , out of keeping with the higher tone of general colouring ; but the interspersion of the comic , provided the due mock-heroic stateliness be kept up in the language , has often the effect of light and shade , as will be apparent on looking at Cowper 's exquisite “ Task , ” although he has often “ offended against taste . ” The only difficulty is happily to steer “ from grave to gay . ”</p>
   <p>So far respecting the plan , the execution , the versification , and style . As to the sentiments conveyed in this poem , and in the notes , I must explicitly declare , that when I am convinced , as a clergyman and a magistrate , that there has been an increase of crime , owing , among other causes , to the system pursued by some “ nominal Christians , ” who will not preach “ these three ” ( faith , hope , and charity ) according to the order of St Paul , but keep two of these graces , and the greatest of all , out of sight , upon any human plea or pretension ; when they do not preach , “ Add to your faith virtue ; ” when they will not preach , Christ died for the sins of “ the world , and not for ours only ; ” when , from any pleas of their own , or persuaded by any sophistry or faction , they become , most emphatically , “ dumb dogs ” to the sublime and affecting moral parts of that gospel which they have engaged before God to deliver ; and above all , when crimes , as I am verily persuaded have been , are , and must be , the consequence of such public preaching ,— leaving others to “ stand or fall ” to their own God ; I shall be guided by my own understanding , and the plain Word of God , as I find it earnestly , simply , beautifully , and divinely set before me by Christ and his Apostles ; and so feeling , I shall as fearlessly deliver my own opinions , being assured , whether popular or unpopular , whether they offend this man or that , this sect or that sect , they will not easily be shaken .</p>
   <p>I might ask , why did St Paul add , so emphatically , “ these three , ” when he enumerated the Christian graces ? Doubtless , because he thought the distinction very important . Why did St Peter say , “ Add to your faith virtue ” ? Because he thought it equally important and essential . Why did St John say , “ Christ died for the sins of the whole world , and not for ours only ” ? Because he thought it equally important and necessary .</p>
   <p>Never omitting the atonement , justification by faith , the fruits of the Spirit , and never separating faith from its hallowed fellowship , we shall find all other parts of the gospel unite in harmonious subordination ; but if we shade the moral parts down , leave them out , contradict them , by insidious sophistry , the Scripture , so far from being “ rightly divided , ” will be discordant and clashing . The man , be he whom he may , who preaches “ faith ” without charity ; who preaches “ faith without virtue , ” is as pernicious and false an expounder of the divine message , as he who preaches “ good works , ” without their legitimate and only foundation — Christian faith .</p>
   <p>One would suppose , from the language of some preachers , the “ civil , ” “ decent , ” “ moral ” people , from the times of Baxter to the present , want amendment most . We all know that mere morals , which have no Christian basis , are not the gospel of Christ ; but I might tell Richard , with great respect notwithstanding , for I respect his sincerity and his heart , that , at least , “ decent , ” and “ civil , ” and “ moral ” people ,<span corresp="#note3" type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>are not worse than indecent , immoral , and uncivil people ; and when there are so many of these last , I think a word or two of reproof would not much hurt them , let the “ decent , ” “ moral , ” and “ civil ” be as wicked as they may .</p>
   <p>I hope it is not necessary for me to disclaim , in speaking of facts , the most remote idea of throwing a slight on the sincerely pious of any portion of the community ; but , if religion does not invigorate the higher feelings and principles of moral obligation ; if a heartless and hollow jargon is often substituted for the fundamental laws of Christian obedience ; if ostentatious affectation supersedes the meek , unobtrusive character of feminine devotion ; if a petty peculiarity of system , a kind of conventional code of godliness , usurps the place of the specific righteousness , visible in its fruits , “ of whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are lovely ; ” if , to be fluent and flippant in the jargon of this petty peculiarity of code , is made the criterion of exclusive godliness ; when , by thousands and thousands , after the example of Hawker , and others of the same school , Christianity is represented as having neither “ an if , or but , ” the conclusion being left for the innumerable disciples of such a gospel school ; when , because none — “ no , not one ” — is without sin , and none can stand upright in the sight of Him whose eyes are too pure to behold iniquity , they who have exercised themselves to “ have a conscience void of offence toward God and man , ” though sensible of innumerable offences , are considered , by implication , before God , as no better than Burkes or Thurtles , for the imputation of utter depravity must mean this , or be mere hollow verba et voces ; when amusements , or recreations , vicious only in their excess , are proclaimed as national abominations , while real abominations stalk abroad , as is the case in large manufacturing towns , with “ the Lord , ” “ the Lord , ” on the lips of some of the most depraved ; when , from these causes , I do sincerely believe the heart has been hardened , and the understanding deteriorated , the wide effects being visible on the great criminal body of the nation ,— I conceive I do a service to Evangelical Religion by speaking as I feel of that ludicrous caricature which so often in society usurps its name , and apes and disgraces its divine character .</p>
   <p>I am not among those who divide the clergy of the Church of England into classes ; and I think it my duty ingenuously to declare , that the opinions I have expressed of the effects of such public doctrines as I have described , be they preached or published by whom they may , were written without communication with any one living . I think it right to declare this , most explicitly , lest the distinguished person to whom this poem is inscribed , might be supposed to have any participation in such sentiments ; though , I trust , no possible objection could be made to the manly avowal of my opinion of the injurious effects of Antinomian , or shades of Antinomian doctrines .</p>
   <p>Further , the object of my remarks is not piety , but ostentatious publicity and affectation ,— far more disgusting in the assumed garb of female piety than under any shape ; and often attended by acting far more disgusting than any acting on any stage .</p>
   <p>BANWELL CAVE .</p>
   <p>The following extract of a letter from Mr Warner will enable the reader to form his own opinion concerning the vast accumulation of bones in this cave :—</p>
   <p>“ The sagacity of Mr Beard having detected the existence of the cavern , and his perseverance effected a precipitous descent into it , the objects offered to his notice were of the most astonishing and paradoxical description — ‘ an antre vast , ’ rude from the hand of nature , of various elevations , and branching into several recesses ; its floor overspread with a huge mingled mass of bones and mud , black earth ( or decomposed animal matter ) , and sand from the Severn sea , which flows about six miles to the northward of Banwell village . The quantity of bones , and the mode by which they could be conveyed to , and deposited in , the place they occupied , were points of equal difficulty to be explained : as the former amounted to several waggon loads ; and as no access to the cavern appeared to exist , except a fissure from above , utterly incapable , from its narrow dimensions , of admitting the falling in of any animal larger than a common sheep ; whereas it was evident that huge quadrupeds , such as unknown beasts of the ox tribe , bears , wolves , and probably hyenas and tigers , had perished in the cave . But , though the questions how and when were unanswerable , this conclusion was irresistibly forced upon the mind , by the phenomena submitted to the eye , that , as the receptacle was infinitely too small to contain such a crowd of animals in their living state , they must necessarily have occupied it in succession : one portion of them after another paying the debt of nature , and ( leaving their bones only , as a memorial of their existence on the spot ) thus making room in the cavern for a succeeding set of inhabitants , of similarly ferocious habits to themselves . The difficulty , indeed , of the ingress of such beasts into the cave did not long continue to be invincible ; as Mr Beard discovered and cleared out a lateral aperture in it , sufficiently inclining from the perpendicular , and sufficiently large in its dimensions , to admit of the easy descent into this subterraneous apartment of one of its unwieldy tenants , though loaded with its prey .</p>
   <p>“ From the circumstances premised , you will probably anticipate my thoughts on these remarkable phenomena ; if not , they are as follow :— I consider the cavern to have been formed at the period of the original deposition and consolidation of the matter constituting the mountain limestone in which it is found ; possibly by the agency of some elastic gas , imprisoned in the mass , which prevented the approximation of its particles to each other ; or by some unaccountable interruption to the operation of the usual laws of its crystallization ;— that , for a long succession of ages anterior to the Deluge , and previously to man 's inhabiting the colder regions of the earth , Banwell Cave had been inhabited by successive generations of beasts of prey ; which , as hunger dictated , issued from their den , pursued and slaughtered the gregarious animals , or wilder quadrupeds , in its neighbourhood ; and dragged them , either bodily or piecemeal , to this retreat , in order to feast upon them at leisure , and undisturbed ;— that the bottom of the cavern thus became a kind of charnel-house , of various and unnumbered beasts ;— that this scene of excursive carnage continued till ‘ the flood came , ’ blending ‘ the oppressor with the oppressed , ’ and mixing the hideous furniture of the den with a quantity of extraneous matter , brought from the adjoining shore , and subjacent lands , by the waters of the Deluge , which rolled , surging ( as Kirwan imagines ) , from the north-western quarter ;— that , previously to this total submersion , as the flood increased on the lower grounds , the animals which fed upon them ascended the heights of Mendip , to escape impending death ; and with panic rushed ( as many as could gain entrance ) into this dwelling-place of their worst enemies ;— that numberless birds also , terrified by the elemental tumult , flew into the same den , as a place of temporary refuge ;— that the interior of the cavern was speedilly filled by the roaring Deluge , whose waters , dashing and crushing the various substances which they embraced , against the rugged rocks , or against each other ; and continuing this violent and incessant action for at least three months , at length tore asunder every connected form , separated every skeleton , and produced that confusion of substances , that scene of disjecta membra , that mixture and disjunction of bones , which were apparent on the first inspection of the cavern ; and which are now visible in that part of it which has been hitherto untouched . ”</p>
   <p>Respecting the language of the Poem , I had nearly forgotten one remark . In almost all the local poems I have read , there is a confusion of the following nature . A local descriptive poem must consist , first , of the graphic view of the scenery around the spot from whence the view is taken ; and , secondly , of the reflections and feelings which that view may be supposed to excite . The feelings of the heart naturally associate themselves with the idea of the tones of the supposed poetical harp ; but external scenes are the province of the pencil , for the harp cannot paint woods and hills , and therefore , in almost all descriptive poems , the pencil and the lyre clash . Hence , in one page , the poet speaks of his lyre , and in the next , when he leaves feelings to paint to the eye , before the harp is out of the hand , he turns to the pencil ! This fault is almost inevitable ; the reader , therefore , will see in the first page of this Poem , that the graphic pencil is assumed , when the tones of the harp were inappropriate .</p>

      <l n="19">Perished at the Almighty 's voice , and swept 17</l>
      <l n="20">With all its noise away ! Since then , unmarked ,</l>
      <l n="21">In that rude cave those dark memorials lay ,</l>
      <l n="22">And told no tale !</l>
      <l n="23">Spirit of other times ,</l>
      <l n="24">Sad shadow of the ancient world , come forth !</l>
      <l n="25">Thou who has slept four thousand years , awake !</l>
      <l n="26">Rise from the cavern 's last recess , and say ,</l>
      <l n="27">What giant cleft in twain the neighbouring rocks ,<span corresp="#note5" type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
      <l n="28">Then slept for ages in vast Ogo 's Cave ,<span corresp="#note6" type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
      <l n="29">And left them rent and frowning from that hour ;</l>
      <l n="30">Say , rather , when the stern Archangel stood ,</l>
      <l n="31">Above the tossing of the flood , what arm</l>
      <l n="32">Shattered this mountain , and its hollow chasm 30</l>
      <l n="33">Heaped with the mute memorials of that doom !</l>
      <l n="34">Spirit of other times , thou speakest not !</l>
      <l n="35">Yet who could gaze a moment on that wreck</l>
      <l n="36">Of desolation , but must pause to think</l>
      <l n="37">Of the mutations of the globe — of time ,</l>
      <l n="38">Hurrying to onward spoil — of his own life ,</l>
      <l n="39">Swift passing , as the summer light , away —</l>
      <l n="40">Of Him who spoke , and the dread storm went forth .</l>
      <l n="41">The surge came , and the surge went back , and there —</l>
      <l n="42">There — when the black abyss had ceased to roar , 40</l>
      <l n="43">And waters , shrinking from the rocks and hills ,</l>
      <l n="44">Slept in the solitary sunshine — there</l>
      <l n="45">The bones that strew the inmost cavern lay :</l>
      <l n="46">And when forgotten centuries had passed ,</l>
      <l n="47">And the gray smoke went up from villages ,</l>
      <l n="48">And cities , with their towers and temples , shone ,</l>
      <l n="49">And kingdoms rose and perished — there they lay !</l>
      <l n="50">The crow sailed o'er the spot ; the villager</l>
      <l n="51">Plodded to morning toil , yet undisturbed 49</l>
      <l n="52">They lay :— when , lo ! as if but yesterday</l>

      <l n="71">In blended colours , images and shades</l>
      <l n="72">Long passed , now rising , as at Memory 's call , 70</l>
      <l n="73">Again in softer light .</l>

      <l n="79">Weston ; and , far away , one wandering ship ,</l>
      <l n="80">Where stretches into mist the Severn sea .</l>
      <l n="81">There , mingled with the clouds , old Cambria draws</l>
      <l n="82">Its stealing line of mountains , lost in haze ; 80</l>
      <l n="83">There , in mid-channel , sit the sister holms ,<span corresp="#note8" type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
      <l n="84">Secure and tranquil , though the tide 's vast sweep , 82</l>
      <l n="85">As it rides by , might almost seem to rive</l>

      <l n="90">But , lo , the Cave !</l>
      <l n="91">Descend the steps , cut rudely in the rock ,</l>
      <l n="92">Cautious . The yawning vault is at our feet ! 90</l>
      <l n="93">Long caverns , winding within caverns , spread</l>
      <l n="94">On either side their labyrinths ; all dark ,</l>
      <l n="95">Save where the light falls glimmering on huge bones ,</l>

      <l n="103">How nature , vaulting the rude chamber , scooped</l>
      <l n="104">Its vast recesses ; he with learning vast</l>

      <l n="215">Come , live with me , and we two will rejoice :</l>
      <l n="216">Nor want I company ; for when the sea 214</l>
      <l n="217">Shines in the silent moonlight , elves and fays ,</l>
      <l n="218">Gentle and delicate as Ariel ,</l>
      <l n="219">That do their spiritings on these wild holts ,</l>
      <l n="220">Circle me in their dance , and sing such songs</l>
      <l n="221">As human ear ne'er heard ! But cease the strain ,</l>
      <l n="222">Lest wisdom and severer truth should chide . 220</l>
      <l n="223">Behind that windmill , sailing round and round ,</l>
      <l n="224">Like days on days revolving , Bleadon lies ,</l>
      <l n="225">Where first I pondered on the grammar-lore ,</l>
      <l n="226">Sad as the spelling-book , beneath the roof</l>
      <l n="227">Of its secluded parsonage ; Brean Down</l>
      <l n="228">Emerges o'er the edge of Hutton Hill ,</l>
      <l n="229">Just seen in paler light ! And Weston there ,</l>
      <l n="230">Where I remember a few cottages</l>
      <l n="231">Sprinkling the sand , uplifts its tower , and shines ,</l>
      <l n="232">As if in conscious beauty , o'er the scene . 230</l>
      <l n="233">And I have seen a far more welcome sight ,</l>
      <l n="234">The living line of population stream —</l>
      <l n="235">Children , and village maids , and gray old men —</l>
      <l n="236">Stream o'er the sands to church : such change has been</l>
      <l n="237">In the brief compass of one hastening life !</l>
      <l n="238">And yet that hill , the light , is to my eyes</l>
      <l n="239">Familiar as those sister isles that sit</l>
      <l n="240">In the mid channel ! Look , how calm they sit ,</l>
      <l n="241">As listening each to the tide 's rocking roar !</l>
      <l n="242">Of different aspects — this , abrupt and high , 240</l>
      <l n="243">And desolate , and cold , and bleak , uplifts</l>
      <l n="244">Its barren brow — barren , but on its steep</l>
      <l n="245">One native flower is seen , the peony ;</l>
      <l n="246">One flower , which smiles in sunshine or in storm ,</l>
      <l n="247">There sits companionless , but yet not sad :</l>
      <l n="248">She has no sister of the summer-field ,</l>
      <l n="249">None to rejoice with her when spring returns ,</l>
      <l n="250">None that , in sympathy , may bend its head , 248</l>
      <l n="251">When evening winds blow hollow o'er the rock ,</l>
      <l n="252">In autumn 's gloom ! So Virtue , a fair flower ,</l>
      <l n="253">Blooms on the rock of Care , and , though unseen ,</l>
      <l n="254">So smiles in cold seclusion ; while , remote</l>
      <l n="255">From the world 's flaunting fellowship , it wears ,</l>
      <l n="256">Like hermit Piety , one smile of peace ,</l>
      <l n="257">In sickness or in health , in joy or tears ,</l>
      <l n="258">In summer days or cold adversity ;</l>
      <l n="259">And still it feels Heaven 's breath , reviving , steal</l>
      <l n="260">On its lone breast ; feels the warm blessedness</l>
      <l n="261">Of Heaven 's own light about it , though its leaves</l>
      <l n="262">Are wet with evening tears ! 260</l>
      <l n="263">Yonder island</l>
      <l n="264">Seems not so desolate , nor frowns aloof ,</l>
      <l n="265">As if from human kind . The lighthouse there ,</l>
      <l n="266">Through the long winter night , shows its pale fire ;</l>
      <l n="267">And three forgotten mounds mark the rude graves ,</l>
      <l n="268">None knows of whom ; but those of men who breathed ,</l>
      <l n="269">And bore their part in life , and looked to Heaven ,</l>
      <l n="270">As man looks now !— they died and left no name !</l>
      <l n="271">Fancy might think , amid the wilderness</l>
      <l n="272">Of waves , they sought to hide from human eyes 270</l>
      <l n="273">All memory of their fortunes . Till the trump</l>
      <l n="274">Of doom , they rest unknown . But mark that hill —</l>
      <l n="275">Where Kewstoke seems to creep into the sea ,</l>
      <l n="276">Thy abbey , Woodspring , rose .<span corresp="#note13" type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>Wild is the spot ;</l>
      <l n="277">And there three mailed murderers retired ,</l>
      <l n="278">To the last point of land . There they retired , 276</l>
      <l n="279">And there they knelt upon the ground , and cried ,</l>
      <l n="280">Bury us ‘ mid the waves , where none may know</l>
      <l n="281">The whispered secret of a deed of blood !</l>
      <l n="282">No stone is o'er those graves :— the sullen tide ,</l>
      <l n="283">As it flows by and sounds along the shore ,</l>
      <l n="284">Seems moaningly to say , Pray for our souls !</l>
      <l n="285">Nor other “ Miserere ” have they had</l>
      <l n="286">At eve , nor other orison at morn .</l>
      <l n="287">Thou hast put on thy mildest look to-day ,</l>
      <l n="288">Thou mighty element ! Solemn , and still ,</l>
      <l n="289">And motionless , and touched with softer light ,</l>
      <l n="290">And without noise , lies all thy long expanse .</l>
      <l n="291">Thou seemest now as calm , as if a child</l>
      <l n="292">Might dally with thy playfulness , and stand , 290</l>
      <l n="293">The weak winds lifting gently its light hair ;</l>
      <l n="294">Upon thy margin , watching one by one</l>
      <l n="295">The long waves , breaking slow , with such a sound</l>
      <l n="296">As Silence , in her dreamy mood , might love ,</l>
      <l n="297">When she more softly breathed , fearing a breath</l>
      <l n="298">Might mar thy placidness !</l>
      <l n="299">Oh , treachery !</l>
      <l n="300">So still , and like a giant in his strength</l>
      <l n="301">Reposing , didst thou lie , when the fond sire</l>
      <l n="302">One moment looked , and saw his blithsome boys 300</l>
      <l n="303">Gay on the sands , one moment , and the next ,</l>
      <l n="304">Heart-stricken and bereft , by the same surge ,</l>
      <l n="305">Stood in his desolation ;<span corresp="#note14" type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>— for he looked ,</l>
      <l n="306">And thought how he had blessed them in their sleep ,</l>
      <l n="307">And the next moment they were borne away ,</l>
      <l n="308">Snatched by the circling surge , and seen no more ;</l>
      <l n="309">While morning shone , and not a ripple told 307</l>
      <l n="310">How terrible and dark a deed was done !</l>
      <l n="311">And so the seas were hushed , and not a cloud</l>
      <l n="312">Marred the pale moonlight , save that , here and there ,</l>
      <l n="313">Wandering far off , some feathery shreds were seen ,</l>
      <l n="314">As the sole orb , above the lighthouse , held</l>
      <l n="315">Its course in loveliness ; and not a sound</l>
      <l n="316">Came from the distant deep , save that , at times ,</l>
      <l n="317">Amid the noise of human merriment ,</l>
      <l n="318">The ear might seem to catch a low faint moan ,</l>
      <l n="319">A boding sound , as of a dying dirge ,</l>
      <l n="320">From the sunk rocks ;<span corresp="#note15" type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>while all was still beside ,</l>
      <l n="321">And every star seemed listening in its watch ;</l>
      <l n="322">When the gay packet-bark , to Erin bound , 320</l>
      <l n="323">Resounding with the laugh and song , went on !</l>
      <l n="324">Look ! she is gone ! O God ! she is gone down ,</l>
      <l n="325">With her light-hearted company ; gone down ,</l>
      <l n="326">And all at once is still , save , on the mast ,</l>
      <l n="327">Just peering o'er the waters , the wild shrieks</l>
      <l n="328">Of three , at times , are heard ! They , when the dead</l>
      <l n="329">Were round them , floating on the moonlight wave ,</l>
      <l n="330">Kept there their dismal watch till morning dawned ,</l>
      <l n="331">And to the living world were then restored !</l>

      <l n="343">We were belated on our road , ‘ mid scenes 10</l>
      <l n="344">New and unknown ,— a mother and her child ,</l>
      <l n="345">Now first in this wide world a wanderer :—</l>
      <l n="346">My father came , the pastor of the church<span corresp="#note16" type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span></l>
      <l n="347">That crowns the high hill crest , above the sea ;</l>
      <l n="348">When , as the wheels went slow , and the still night</l>
      <l n="349">Seemed listening , a low murmur met the ear ,</l>
      <l n="350">Not of the winds :— my mother softly said ,</l>
      <l n="351">Listen ! it is the sea ! With breathless awe ,</l>
      <l n="352">I heard the sound , and closer pressed her hand .</l>
      <l n="353">Much of the sea , in infant wonderment , 20</l>
      <l n="354">I oft had heard , and of the shipwrecked man ,</l>
      <l n="355">Who sees , on some lone isle , day after day ,</l>
      <l n="356">The sun sink o'er the solitude of waves ,</l>
      <l n="357">Like Crusoe ; and the tears would start afresh ,</l>
      <l n="358">Whene'er my mother kissed my cheek , and told</l>
      <l n="359">The story of that desolate wild man , 26</l>
      <l n="360">And how the speaking bird , when he returned</l>
      <l n="361">After long absence to his cave forlorn ,</l>
      <l n="362">Said , as in tones of human sympathy ,</l>
      <l n="363">Poor Robin Crusoe !</l>
      <l n="364">Thoughts like these arose ,</l>
      <l n="365">When first I heard , at night , the distant sound ,</l>
      <l n="366">Great Ocean , “ of thy everlasting voice ! "[ 17 ]</l>
      <l n="367">Where the white parsonage , among the trees ,</l>
      <l n="368">Peeped out , that night I restless passed . The sea</l>
      <l n="369">Filled all my thoughts ; and when slow morning came ,</l>
      <l n="370">And the first sunbeam streaked the window-pane ,</l>
      <l n="371">I rose unnoticed , and with stealthy pace ,</l>
      <l n="372">Straggling along the village green , explored</l>
      <l n="373">Alone my fearful but adventurous way ; 40</l>
      <l n="374">When , having turned the hedgerow , I beheld ,</l>
      <l n="375">For the first time , thy glorious element ,</l>
      <l n="376">Old Ocean , glittering in the beams of morn ,</l>
      <l n="377">Stretching far off , and , westward , without bound ,</l>
      <l n="378">Amid thy sole dominion , rocking loud !</l>
      <l n="379">Shivering I stood , and tearful ; and even now ,</l>
      <l n="380">When gathering years have marked my look ,— even now</l>
      <l n="381">I feel the deep impression of that hour ,</l>
      <l n="382">As but of yesterday !</l>
      <l n="383">Spirit of Time , 50</l>
      <l n="384">A moment pause , and I will speak to thee !</l>
      <l n="385">Dark clouds are round thee ; but , lo ! Memory waves</l>
      <l n="386">Her wand ,— the clouds disperse , as the gray rack</l>
      <l n="387">Disperses while we gaze , and light steals out ,</l>
      <l n="388">While the gaunt phantom almost seems to drop</l>
      <l n="389">His scythe ! Now shadows of the past , distinct ,</l>
      <l n="390">Are thronging round ; the voices of the dead</l>
      <l n="391">Are heard ; and , lo ! the very smoke goes up —</l>
      <l n="392">For so it seems — from yonder tenement , 60</l>
      <l n="393">Where leads the slender pathway to the door .</l>
      <l n="394">Enter that small blue parlour : there sits one ,</l>
      <l n="395">A female , and a child is in her arms ;</l>
      <l n="396">A child leans at her side , intent to show</l>
      <l n="397">A pictured book , and looks upon her face ;</l>
      <l n="398">One , from the green , comes with a cowslip ball ;<span corresp="#note18" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span></l>
      <l n="399">And one ,<span corresp="#note19" type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>a hero , sits sublime and horsed ,</l>
      <l n="400">Upon a rocking-steed , from Banwell-fair ;</l>
      <l n="401">This ,<span corresp="#note20" type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>drives his tiny wheel-barrow , without ,</l>
      <l n="402">On the green garden-sward ; whilst one ,<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>apart ,</l>
      <l n="403">Sighs o'er his solemn task — the spelling-book — 70</l>
      <l n="404">Half moody , half in tears . Some lines of thought</l>
      <l n="405">Are on that matron 's brow ; yet placidness ,</l>
      <l n="406">Such as resigned religion gives , is there ,</l>
      <l n="407">Mingled with sadness ; for who e'er beheld ,</l>
      <l n="408">Without one stealing sigh , a progeny</l>
      <l n="409">Of infants clustering round maternal knees ,</l>
      <l n="410">Nor felt some boding fears , how they might fare</l>
      <l n="411">In the wide world , when they who loved them most</l>
      <l n="412">Were silent in their graves !</l>

      <l n="431">Whose future fate they pondered with a sigh ?</l>
      <l n="432">Long , nor unprosperous , has been his way</l>
      <l n="433">Through life 's tumultuous scenes , who , when a child , 100</l>
      <l n="434">Played in that garden platform in the sun ;</l>
      <l n="435">Or loitered o'er the common , and pursued</l>
      <l n="436">The colts among the sand-hills ; or , intent</l>
      <l n="437">On hardier enterprise , his pumpkin-ship ,</l>
      <l n="438">New-rigged , and buoyant , with its tiny sail ,</l>
      <l n="439">Launched on the garden pond ; or stretched his hand ,</l>
      <l n="440">At once forgetting all this glorious toil ,</l>
      <l n="441">When the bright butterfly came wandering by .</l>
      <l n="442">But never will that day pass from his mind ,</l>
      <l n="443">When , scarcely breathing for delight , at Wells , 110</l>
      <l n="444">He saw the horsemen of the clock<span corresp="#note23" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>ride round ,</l>
      <l n="445">As if for life ; and ancient Blandifer ,<span corresp="#note24" type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span></l>
      <l n="446">Seated aloft , like Hermes , in his chair</l>
      <l n="447">Complacent as when first he took his seat ,</l>
      <l n="448">Some hundred years ago ; saw him lift up ,</l>
      <l n="449">As if old Time was cowering at his feet ,</l>
      <l n="450">Solemn lift up his mace , and strike the bell ,</l>
      <l n="451">Himself for ever silent in his seat .</l>
      <l n="452">How little thought I then , the hour would come ,</l>
      <l n="453">When the loved prelate of that beauteous fane , 120</l>
      <l n="454">At whose command I write , might placidly</l>
      <l n="455">Smile on this picture , in my future verse , 122</l>
      <l n="456">When Blandifer had struck so many hours</l>
      <l n="457">For me , his poet , in this vale of years ,</l>
      <l n="458">Himself unchanged and solemn as of yore !</l>
      <l n="459">My father was the pastor , and the friend</l>
      <l n="460">Of all who , living then — the scene is closed —</l>
      <l n="461">Now silent in that rocky churchyard sleep ,</l>
      <l n="462">The aged and the young ! A village then</l>
      <l n="463">Was not as villages are now . The hind , 130</l>
      <l n="464">Who delved , or “ jocund drove his team a-field , ”</l>
      <l n="465">Had then an independence in his look</l>
      <l n="466">And heart ; and , plodding on his lowly path ,</l>
      <l n="467">Disdained a parish dole , content , though poor .</l>
      <l n="468">He was the village monitor : he taught</l>
      <l n="469">His children to be good , and read their book ,</l>
      <l n="470">And in the gallery took his Sunday place ,—</l>
      <l n="471">To-morrow , with the bee , to work .</l>
      <l n="472">So passed</l>
      <l n="473">His days of cheerful , independent toil ; 140</l>
      <l n="474">And when the pastor came that way , at eve ,</l>
      <l n="475">He had a ready present for the child</l>
      <l n="476">Who read his book the best ; and that poor child</l>
      <l n="477">Remembered it , when , treading the same path</l>
      <l n="478">In which his father trod , he so grew up</l>
      <l n="479">Contented , till old Time had blanched his locks ,</l>
      <l n="480">And he was borne — whilst the bell tolled — to sleep</l>
      <l n="481">In the same churchyard where his father slept !</l>
      <l n="482">His daughter walked content , and innocent</l>
      <l n="483">As lovely , in her lowly path . She turned 150</l>
      <l n="484">The hour-glass , while the humming wheel went round ,</l>

      <l n="513">A different scene comes next : That village maid 180</l>

      <l n="526">The wheel is silent in the vale ! Old age</l>
      <l n="527">And youth are levelled by one parish law !</l>
      <l n="528">Ask why that maid , all day , toils in the field ,</l>
      <l n="529">Associate with the rude and ribald clown ,</l>
      <l n="530">Even in the shrinking April of her youth ?</l>
      <l n="531">To earn her loaf , and eat it by herself .</l>
      <l n="532">Parental love is smitten to the dust ;</l>
      <l n="533">Over a little smoke the aged sire 200</l>
      <l n="534">Holds his pale hands — and the deserted hearth</l>
      <l n="535">Is cheerless as his heart : but Piety</l>

      <l n="543">Sick of the din , retires to pray alone . 210</l>
      <l n="544">But though abused Religion , and the dole</l>
      <l n="545">Of pauper-pay , and vomitories huge</l>

      <l n="567">A friendless maid , so beautiful and young ,</l>

   <p>I subjoin the plain narrative of the singular event on which this tale is founded , from Mr Polwhele , that the reader may see how far , poetically , I have departed from plain facts , and what I have thought it best to add for the sake of moral , picturesque , and poetical effect . The narrative is as follows :—</p>
   <p>“ October , 1780 . Thomas Thomas , aged 37 . This man died of mental anguish , or what is called a broken heart . He lived in the village of Drannock , in the parish of Gwinnear , till an unhappy event occurred , which proved fatal to his peace of mind for more than eight years , and finally occasioned his death . He courted Elizabeth Thomas , of the same village , who was his first-cousin ; and it was understood that they were under a matrimonial engagement . But in May 1772 , some little disagreement having happened between them , he , out of resentment , or from some other motive , paid great attention to another girl ; and on Sunday the 31st of that month , in the afternoon , accompanied her to the Methodist meeting at Wall . During their absence , the slighted female , who was very beautiful in her person , but of an extremely irritable temper , took a rope and a common prayer-book , in which she had folded down the 109th Psalm , and , going into an adjacent field , hanged herself . Thomas , on his return from the preaching , inquired for Betsy ; and being told she had not been seen for two or three hours , he exclaimed , ‘ Good God ! she has destroyed herself ! ’ which apprehension seems to show , either that she had threatened to commit suicide in consequence of his desertion , or that he dreaded it from a knowledge of the violence of her disposition . But when he saw that his fears were realised , and had read the psalm , so full of execrations , which she had pointed out to him , he cried out , ‘ I am ruined for ever and ever ! ’ The very sight of this village and neighbourhood was now become insupportable , and he went to live at Marazion , hoping that a change of scene and social intercourse might expel those excruciating reflections which harrowed up his very soul , or at least render them less acute ; but in this he appeared to be mistaken , for he found himself closely pursued by the evil demon</p>

     <l n="1">‘ Despair , whose torments no man , sure ,</l>
     <l n="2">But lovers and the damned endure . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ To hear the 109th Psalm would petrify him with horror , and therefore he would not attend divine service on the 22d day of the month ; he dreaded to go near a reading school , lest he should hear the dreaded lesson . Whatever misfortunes befel him ( and these were not a few , for he was several times hurt , and even maimed , in the mines in which he laboured ) , he still attributed them all to the malevolent agency of the deceased , and thought he could find allusions to the whole in the calamitous legacy which she had bequeathed him . When he slumbered , for he knew nothing of sound sleep , the injured girl appeared to his imagination , with such a countenance as she retained after the rash action , and the prayer-book in her hand , open at the hateful psalm ; and he was frequently heard to cry out , ‘ Oh , my dear Betsy , shut the book , shut the book ! ’ etc . With a mind so disturbed and deranged , though he could not reasonably expect much consolation from matrimony , yet imagining that the cares of a family might distract his thoughts from the miserable subject by which he was harassed both by day and night , he successively paid his addresses to many girls of Marazion ; but they indignantly flew from him , and with a sneer asked him , whether he was desirous of bringing all the curses in the 109th Psalm on their heads ? At length , however , he succeeded with one who had less superstition and more fortitude than the rest , and he led her to St Hilary church , to be married , January 21 , 1778 ; but on the road thither , they were overtaken by a sudden and violent hurricane , such as those which not unfrequently happen in the vicinity of Mount 's Bay ; and he , suspecting that poor Betsy rode the whirlwind and directed the storm , was convulsed with terror , and was literally ‘ coupled with fear . ’ Such is the power of conscious guilt to impute accidental occurrences to the hand of vindictive justice , and so true is the observation of the poet ,</p>
   <p>‘ Judicium metuit sibi mens mali conscia justum . ’</p>
   <p>“ He lived long enough to have a son and a daughter ; but the corrosive worm within his breast preyed upon his vitals , and at length consumed all the powers of his body , as it had long before destroyed the tranquillity of his mind , and he was released from all his pangs , both mental and corporeal , on Friday , October 20 , 1780 , and buried at St Hilary , the Sunday following , during evening service . ”</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Oh ! shut the book , dear Mary , shut the book !</l>
     <l n="2">So William cried , with wild and frantic look .</l>
     <l n="3">She whom he loved was in her shroud , nor pain</l>
     <l n="4">Nor grief can visit her sad heart again .</l>
     <l n="5">There is no sculptured tombstone at her head ; 5</l>
     <l n="6">No rude memorial marks her lowly bed :</l>
     <l n="7">The village children , every holiday ,</l>
     <l n="8">Round the green turf , in summer sunshine play ;</l>
     <l n="9">And none , but those now bending to the tomb ,</l>
     <l n="10">Remember Mary , lovely in her bloom ! 10</l>
     <l n="11">Yet oft the hoary swain , when autumn sighs</l>
     <l n="12">Through the long grass , sees a dim form arise ,</l>
     <l n="13">That hies in glimmering moonlight to the brook ,</l>
     <l n="14">Its wan lips moving , in its hand a book .</l>
     <l n="15">So , like a bruised flower , and in the pride</l>
     <l n="16">Of youth and beauty , injured Mary died .</l>
     <l n="17">William some years survived , but years no trace</l>
     <l n="18">Of his sick heart 's deep anguish could erase .</l>
     <l n="19">Still the dread spectre seemed to rise , and , worse ,</l>
     <l n="20">Still in his ears rang the appalling curse ! 20</l>
     <l n="21">While loud he cries , despair upon his look ,</l>
     <l n="22">Oh ! shut the book , my Mary , shut the book !</l>
     <l n="23">The sun is slowly westering now , and lo ,</l>
     <l n="24">How beautiful steals out the humid bow ,</l>
     <l n="25">A radiant arch ! Listen , whilst I relate</l>
     <l n="26">William 's dread judgment , and poor Mary 's fate .</l>
     <l n="27">I think I see the pine , that , heavily</l>
     <l n="28">Swaying , yet seems as for the dead to sigh .</l>
     <l n="29">How many generations , since the day</l>
     <l n="30">Of its green pride , have passed , like leaves , away ! 30</l>
     <l n="31">How many children of the hamlet played</l>
     <l n="32">Round its hoar trunk , who at its feet were laid ,</l>
     <l n="33">Withered and gray old men ! In life 's first bloom</l>
     <l n="34">How many has it seen borne to the tomb !</l>
     <l n="35">But never one so sunk in hopeless woe</l>
     <l n="36">As she who lies in the cold grave below .</l>
     <l n="37">Her Sabbath-book , from which at church she prayed ,</l>
     <l n="38">Was her poor father 's , in that churchyard laid :</l>
     <l n="39">For Mary grew as beautiful in youth , 39</l>
     <l n="40">As taught at church the lore of heavenly truth .</l>
     <l n="41">What different passions in her bosom strove ,</l>
     <l n="42">When first she heard the tale of village love !</l>
     <l n="43">The youth whose voice then won her partial ear ,</l>
     <l n="44">A yeoman 's son , had passed his twentieth year ;</l>
     <l n="45">She scarce eighteen : her mother , with the care</l>
     <l n="46">Of boding age , oft whispered , Oh , beware !</l>
     <l n="47">For William was a thoughtless youth , and wild ,</l>
     <l n="48">And like a colt unbroken , from a child :</l>
     <l n="49">At length , if not to serious thoughts awake ,</l>
     <l n="50">He came to church , at least for Mary 's sake . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Young Mary , while her father was alive ,</l>
     <l n="52">Saw all things round the humble dwelling thrive ;</l>
     <l n="53">Her widowed mother now was growing old ,</l>
     <l n="54">And bit by bit their worldly goods were sold :</l>
     <l n="55">Mary remained , her mother 's hope and pride !</l>
     <l n="56">How oft when she was sleeping by her side ,</l>
     <l n="57">That mother waked , and kissed her cheek , with tears</l>
     <l n="58">Praying for blessings on her future years ,—</l>
     <l n="59">When she , her mother , earthly trials o'er ,</l>
     <l n="60">Should rest in the cold grave , to grieve no more ! 60</l>
     <l n="61">But Mary to love 's dream her heart resigned ,</l>
     <l n="62">And gave to fancy all her youthful mind .</l>
     <l n="63">Shall I describe her ! Didst thou never mark</l>
     <l n="64">A soft blue light , beneath eye-lashes dark ?</l>
     <l n="65">Such was her eye 's soft light ;— her chestnut hair ,</l>
     <l n="66">Light as she tripped , waved lighter to the air ;</l>
     <l n="67">And , with her prayer-book , when on Sunday dressed ,</l>
     <l n="68">Her looks a sweet but lowly grace expressed ,</l>
     <l n="69">As modest as the violet at her breast .</l>
     <l n="70">Sometimes all day by her lone mother 's side 70</l>
     <l n="71">She sat , and oft would turn , a tear to hide .</l>
     <l n="72">Where winds the brook , by yonder bordering wood , 72</l>
     <l n="73">Her mother 's solitary cottage stood :</l>
     <l n="74">A few white pales in front , fenced from the road</l>
     <l n="75">The garden-plot , and poor but neat abode .</l>
     <l n="76">Before the window , ‘ mid the flowers of spring</l>
     <l n="77">A bee-hive hummed , whose bees were murmuring ;</l>
     <l n="78">Beneath an ivied bank , abrupt and high ,</l>
     <l n="79">A small clear well reflected bank and sky ,</l>
     <l n="80">In whose translucent mirror , smooth and still , 80</l>
     <l n="81">From time to time , a small bird dipped its bill .</l>
     <l n="82">Here the first bluebell , and , of livelier hue ,</l>
     <l n="83">The daffodil and polyanthus grew .</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Twas Mary 's care a jessamine to train .</l>
     <l n="85">With small white blossoms , round the window-pane :</l>
     <l n="86">A rustic wicket opened to the meads ,</l>
     <l n="87">Where a scant pathway to the hamlet leads :</l>
     <l n="88">And near , a water-wheel toiled round and round ,</l>
     <l n="89">Dashing the o'ershot stream , with long continuous sound .</l>
     <l n="90">Beyond , when the brief shower had sailed away , 90</l>
     <l n="91">The tapering spire shone out in sunlight gray ;</l>
     <l n="92">And o'er that mountain 's northern point , to sight</l>
     <l n="93">Stretching far on , the main-sea rolled in light .</l>
     <l n="94">Enter : within , see everything how neat !</l>
     <l n="95">One book lies open on the window-seat ,</l>
     <l n="96">The spectacles are on a leaf of Job :</l>
     <l n="97">There , mark , a map of the terrestrial globe ;</l>
     <l n="98">And opposite , with its prolific stem ,</l>

     <l n="101">A veritable letter from our Lord :[ 51 ]</l>

     <l n="103">The Book of Prayer , and Drelincourt on Death :</l>
     <l n="104">Some cowslips , in a cup of china placed , 104</l>
     <l n="105">A painted shelf above the chimney graced :</l>
     <l n="106">Grown like its mistress old , with half-shut eyes ,</l>
     <l n="107">Save when , at times , awaked by wandering flies ,</l>
     <l n="108">Tib<span corresp="#note52" type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span>in the sunshine of the casement lies .</l>
     <l n="109">‘ Twas spring time now , with birds the garden rung ,</l>
     <l n="110">And Mary 's linnet at the window sung . 110</l>
     <l n="111">Whilst in the air the vernal music floats ,</l>
     <l n="112">The cuckoo only joins his two sweet notes :[ 53 ]</l>
     <l n="113">But those — oh ! listen , for he sings more near —</l>
     <l n="114">So musical , so mellow , and so clear !</l>
     <l n="115">Not sweeter , where thy mighty waters sweep ,</l>
     <l n="116">Missouri , through the night of forests deep ,</l>
     <l n="117">Resounds , from glade to glade , from rock to hill ,</l>
     <l n="118">While fervent harmonies the wild wood fill ,</l>
     <l n="119">The solitary note of “ whip-poor-will ;"[ 54 ]</l>
     <l n="120">Mary 's old mother stops her wheel to say , 120</l>
     <l n="121">The cuckoo ! hark ! how sweet he sings to-day !</l>
     <l n="122">It is not long , not long to Whitsuntide ,</l>
     <l n="123">And Mary then shall be a happy bride .</l>
     <l n="124">On Sunday morn , when a slant light was flung</l>
     <l n="125">Upon the tower , and the first peal was rung ,</l>
     <l n="126">William and Mary smiling would repair ,</l>
     <l n="127">Arm linked in arm , to the same house of prayer .</l>
     <l n="128">The bells will sound more merrily , he cried ,</l>
     <l n="129">And gently pressed her hand , at Whitsuntide :</l>
     <l n="130">She checked the rising thoughts , and hung her head ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">And Mary , ere one year had passed — was dead !</l>
     <l n="132">‘ Twas said , and many would the tale believe ,</l>
     <l n="133">Her shrouded form was seen upon that eve ,<span corresp="#note55" type="note_anchor">[ 55 ]</span></l>
     <l n="134">When , gliding through the churchyard , they appear — 134</l>
     <l n="135">They who shall die within the coming year .</l>
     <l n="136">All pale , and strangely piteous , was her look ,</l>
     <l n="137">Her right hand was stretched out , and held a book ;</l>
     <l n="138">O'er it her wet hair dripped , while the moon cast</l>
     <l n="139">A cold wan light , as in her shroud she passed !</l>
     <l n="140">I cannot say if this were so , but late , 140</l>
     <l n="141">She went to Madern-stone ,<span corresp="#note56" type="note_anchor">[ 56 ]</span>to learn her fate ,</l>
     <l n="142">What there she heard ne'er came to human ears —</l>
     <l n="143">But from that hour she oft was seen in tears .</l>
     <l n="144">Mild zephyr breathes , the butterfly more bright</l>
     <l n="145">Strays , wavering , o'er the pales , in rainbow light ;</l>
     <l n="146">The lamb , the colt , the blackbird in the brake ,</l>
     <l n="147">Seem all the vernal feeling to partake ;</l>
     <l n="148">The lark sings high in air , itself unseen ,</l>
     <l n="149">The hasty swallow skims the village-green ;</l>
     <l n="150">And all things seem , to the full heart , to bring 150</l>
     <l n="151">The blissful breathings of the world 's first spring .</l>

     <l n="153">The garden bee has wound his earliest horn ,</l>

     <l n="243">So Mary wandered to the northern shore ;<span corresp="#note62" type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span></l>
     <l n="244">There oft she heard the gaunt Tregagel roar</l>
     <l n="245">Among the rocks ; and when the tempest blew ,</l>
     <l n="246">And , like the shivered foam , her long hair flew ,</l>
     <l n="247">And all the billowy space was tossing wide ,</l>
     <l n="248">Rock on ! thou melancholy main , she cried ,</l>
     <l n="249">I love thy voice , oh , ever-sounding sea , 249</l>
     <l n="250">Nor heed this sad world while I look on thee !</l>
     <l n="251">Then on the surge she gazed , with vacant stare ,</l>
     <l n="252">Or tripping with wild fennel in her hair ,<span corresp="#note63" type="note_anchor">[ 63 ]</span></l>
     <l n="253">Sang merrily : Oh ! we must dry the tear ,</l>
     <l n="254">For Mab , the queen of fairies , will be here ,—</l>
     <l n="255">William , she shall know all !— and then again</l>
     <l n="256">Her ditty died into its first sad strain :—</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="257">Lay me where the willows wave ,</l>
     <l n="258">In the cold moonlight ;</l>

     <l n="260">Sadly , stars of night ! 260</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="261">When home returned , the tears ran down apace ;</l>
     <l n="262">She looked in silence in her mother 's face ;</l>
     <l n="263">Then , starting up , with wilder aspect cried ,</l>
     <l n="264">How happy shall we be at Whitsuntide ,</l>
     <l n="265">Then , mother , I shall be a bride — a bride !</l>
     <l n="266">Ah ! some dire thought seems in her breast to rise ,</l>
     <l n="267">Stern with terrific joy she rolls her eyes :</l>
     <l n="268">Her mother heeded not ; nor when she took ,</l>
     <l n="269">With more impatient haste , her Sunday book ,</l>
     <l n="270">She heeded not — for age had dimmed her sight . 270</l>
     <l n="271">Her mother now is left alone : ‘ tis night .</l>
     <l n="272">Mary ! poor Mary ! her sad mother cried ,</l>
     <l n="273">Mary ! my Mary !— but no voice replied .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="274">Next morn , light-hearted William passed along ,</l>
     <l n="275">And careless hummed a desultory song ,</l>
     <l n="276">Bound to St Ives ’ revel .<span corresp="#note64" type="note_anchor">[ 64 ]</span>Not a ray</l>
     <l n="277">Yet streaked the pale dawn of the dubious day ;</l>
     <l n="278">The sun is yet below the hills : but , look ! 278</l>
     <l n="279">There is the tower — the mill — the stile — the brook ,—</l>
     <l n="280">And there is Mary 's cottage ! All is still !</l>
     <l n="281">Listen ! no sound is heard but of the mill .</l>
     <l n="282">‘ Tis true , the toils of day are not begun ,</l>
     <l n="283">But Mary always rose before the sun .</l>
     <l n="284">Still at the door , a leafless relic now ,</l>
     <l n="285">Appeared a remnant of the May-day bough ;</l>
     <l n="286">No hour-glass , in the window , tells the hours :</l>
     <l n="287">Where is poor Mary , where her book , her flowers ?</l>
     <l n="288">Ah ! was it fancy ?— as he passed along ,</l>
     <l n="289">He thought he heard a spirit 's feeble song .<span corresp="#note65" type="note_anchor">[ 65 ]</span></l>
     <l n="290">Struck by the thrilling sound , he turned his look . 290</l>
     <l n="291">Upon the ground there lay an open book ;</l>
     <l n="292">One page was folded down :— Spirit of grace !</l>
     <l n="293">See ! there are soils , like tear-blots , on the place !</l>
     <l n="294">It is a prayer-book ! Soon these words he read ;</l>
     <l n="295">Let him be desolate , and beg his bread !<span corresp="#note66" type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span></l>
     <l n="296">Let there be none , not one , on earth to bless ,—</l>
     <l n="297">Be his days few ,— his children fatherless ,—</l>
     <l n="298">His wife a widow !— let there be no friend</l>
     <l n="299">In his last moments mercy to extend !</l>
     <l n="300">It was a prayer-book he before had seen : 300</l>
     <l n="301">Where ? when ? Once more , wild terror on his mien ,</l>
     <l n="302">He read the page :— An outcast let him lie ,</l>
     <l n="303">And unlamented and forsaken die !</l>
     <l n="304">When he has children , may they pine away</l>
     <l n="305">Before his sight ,— his wife to grief a prey .</l>
     <l n="306">Ah ! ‘ tis poor Mary 's book !— the very same 306</l>
     <l n="307">He read with her at church ; and , lo ! her name :—</l>
     <l n="308">The book of Mary Banks ;— when this you see ,</l>
     <l n="309">And I am dead and gone , remember me !</l>
     <l n="310">He trembles : mark !— the dew is on his brow :</l>
     <l n="311">The curse is hers ! he cried — I feel it now !</l>
     <l n="312">I see already , even at my right hand ,</l>
     <l n="313">Dead Mary , thy accusing spirit stand !</l>
     <l n="314">I feel thy deep , last curse ! Then , with a cry ,</l>
     <l n="315">He sunk upon the earth in agony .</l>
     <l n="316">Feebly he rose ,— when , on the matted hair</l>
     <l n="317">Of a drowned maid , and on her bosom bare ,</l>
     <l n="318">The sun shone out ; how horrid , the first glance</l>
     <l n="319">Of sunlight , on that altered countenance !</l>
     <l n="320">The eyes were open , but though cold and dim , 320</l>
     <l n="321">Fixed with accusing ghastliness on him !</l>
     <l n="322">Merciful God ! with faltering voice he cries ,</l>
     <l n="323">Hide me ! oh , hide me from the sight ! Those eyes —</l>
     <l n="324">They glare on me ! oh , hide me with the dead !</l>
     <l n="325">The curse , the deep curse rests upon my head !</l>
     <l n="326">Alas , poor maid ! ‘ twas frenzy fired thy breast ,</l>
     <l n="327">Which prompted horrors not to be expressed :</l>
     <l n="328">Whilst ever at thy side the foul fiend stood ,</l>
     <l n="329">And , laughing , pointed to the oblivious flood .</l>
     <l n="330">William , heart-stricken , to despair a prey , 330</l>
     <l n="331">Soon left the village , journeying far away .</l>
     <l n="332">For , as if Mary 's ghost in judgment cried ,</l>
     <l n="333">His wife , in the first pains of child-birth , died .</l>
     <l n="334">Who has not heard , St Cuthbert , of thy well ?</l>
     <l n="335">Perhaps the spirit may his fortunes tell .<span corresp="#note67" type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span></l>
     <l n="336">He dropped a pebble — mark ! no bubble bright 336</l>
     <l n="337">Comes from the bottom — turn away thy sight !</l>
     <l n="338">He looks again : O God ! those eye-balls glare</l>
     <l n="339">How terribly ! Ah , smooth that matted hair !</l>
     <l n="340">Mary ! dear Mary ! thy cold corse I see 340</l>
     <l n="341">Rise from the fountain ! Look not thus at me !</l>
     <l n="342">I cannot bear the sight , that form , that look !</l>
     <l n="343">Oh ! shut the book , dear Mary , shut the book !</l>
     <l n="344">Meantime , poor Mary in the grave was laid ;—</l>
     <l n="345">Her lone and gray-haired mother wept and prayed :</l>
     <l n="346">Soon to the dust she followed ; and , unknown ,</l>
     <l n="347">There they both rest without a name or stone .</l>
     <l n="348">The village maids , who pass in summer by ,</l>
     <l n="349">Still stop and say one prayer , for charity !</l>
     <l n="350">But what of William ? Hide me in the mine ! 350</l>
     <l n="351">He cried , the beams of day insulting shine !</l>
     <l n="352">Earth 's very shadows are too gay , too bright ,—</l>
     <l n="353">Hide me for ever in forgetful night !</l>
     <l n="354">In vain — that form , the cause of all his woes ,</l>
     <l n="355">More sternly terrible in darkness rose !</l>
     <l n="356">Nearer he saw , with its pale waving hand ,</l>
     <l n="357">The phantom in appalling stillness stand ;</l>
     <l n="358">The letters of the book shone through the night ,</l>
     <l n="359">More blasting ! Hide , oh hide me from the sight !</l>
     <l n="360">Ocean , to thee and to thy storms I bring 360</l>
     <l n="361">A heart , that not the music of the spring ,</l>
     <l n="362">Nor summer piping on the rural plain ,</l>
     <l n="363">Shall ever wake to happiness again !</l>
     <l n="364">Ocean , be mine ,— wild as thy wastes , to roam</l>
     <l n="365">From clime to clime !— Ocean , be thou my home !</l>
     <l n="366">Some say he died : here he was seen no more ;</l>
     <l n="367">He went to sea ; and oft , amid the roar</l>
     <l n="368">Of the wild waters , starting from his sleep ,</l>
     <l n="369">He gazed upon the wild tempestuous deep ;</l>
     <l n="370">When , slowly rising from the vessel 's lee , 370</l>
     <l n="371">A shape appeared , which none besides could see ;</l>
     <l n="372">Then would he shriek , like one whom Heaven forsook ,</l>
     <l n="373">Oh ! shut the book , dear Mary , shut the book !</l>
     <l n="374">In foreign lands , in darkness or in light ,</l>
     <l n="375">The same dread spectre stood before his sight ;</l>
     <l n="376">If slumber came his aching lids to close ,</l>
     <l n="377">Funereal forms in long procession rose .</l>
     <l n="378">Sometimes he dreamed that every grief was past</l>
     <l n="379">Mary , long lost on earth , is found at last ;</l>
     <l n="380">And now she smiled as when , in early life , 380</l>
     <l n="381">She lived in hope that she should be his wife ;</l>
     <l n="382">The maids are dressed in white , and all are gay ,</l>
     <l n="383">For this ( he dreamed ) is Mary 's wedding-day !</l>
     <l n="384">Then wherefore sad ? a chill comes o'er his soul ,—</l>
     <l n="385">The sounds of mirth are hushed ; and , hark ! a toll !—</l>
     <l n="386">A slow , deep toll ; and lo ! a sable train</l>
     <l n="387">Of mourners , moving to the village fane .</l>
     <l n="388">A coffin now is laid in holy ground ,</l>
     <l n="389">That , heavily , returns a hollow sound ,</l>
     <l n="390">When the first earth upon its lid is thrown : 390</l>
     <l n="391">That hollow sound now changes to a groan :</l>
     <l n="392">While , rising with wan cheek , and dripping hair ,</l>
     <l n="393">And moving lips , and eyes of ghastly glare ,</l>
     <l n="394">The spectre comes again ! It comes more near !</l>
     <l n="395">‘ Tis Mary ! and that book with many a tear</l>
     <l n="396">Is wet , which , with dim fingers , long and cold ,</l>
     <l n="397">He sees her to the glimmering moon unfold .</l>
     <l n="398">And now her hand is laid upon his heart .</l>
     <l n="399">Gasping , he wakes — with a convulsive start ,</l>
     <l n="400">He gazes round ! Moonlight is on the tide — 400</l>
     <l n="401">The passing keel is scarcely heard to glide ,—</l>
     <l n="402">See where the spectre goes ! with frenzied look</l>
     <l n="403">He shrieks again , Oh ! Mary , shut the book !</l>
     <l n="404">Now , to the ocean 's verge the phantom flies ,— 404</l>
     <l n="405">And , hark ! far off , the lessening laughter dies .</l>
     <l n="406">Years passed away ,— at night , or evening close ,</l>
     <l n="407">Faint , and more faint , the accusing spectre rose .</l>
     <l n="408">Restored from toil and perils of the main ,</l>
     <l n="409">Now William treads his native place again .</l>
     <l n="410">Near the Land'shYpppHeNend , upon the rudest shore , 410</l>
     <l n="411">Where , from the west , Atlantic surges roar ,</l>
     <l n="412">He lived , a lonely stranger , sad , but mild ;</l>
     <l n="413">All marked his sadness , chiefly when he smiled ;</l>
     <l n="414">Some competence he gained , by years of toil :</l>
     <l n="415">So , in a cottage , on his native soil ,</l>
     <l n="416">He dwelt , remote from crowds , nor told his tale</l>
     <l n="417">To human ear : he saw the white clouds sail</l>
     <l n="418">Oft o'er the bay ,<span corresp="#note68" type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>when suns of summer shone ,</l>
     <l n="419">Yet still he wandered , muttering and alone .</l>
     <l n="420">At night , when , like the tumult of the tide , 420</l>
     <l n="421">Sinking to sad repose , all trouble died ,</l>
     <l n="422">The book of God was on his pillow laid ,</l>
     <l n="423">He wept upon it , and in secret prayed .</l>
     <l n="424">He had no friend on earth , save one blue jay ,<span corresp="#note69" type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span></l>
     <l n="425">Which , from the Mississippi , far away ,</l>
     <l n="426">O'er the Atlantic , to his native land</l>
     <l n="427">He brought ;— and this poor bird fed from his hand .</l>
     <l n="428">In the great world there was not one beside</l>
     <l n="429">For whom he cared , since his own mother died .</l>
     <l n="430">Yet manly strength was his , for twenty-years 430</l>
     <l n="431">Weighed light upon his frame , though passed in tears ;</l>
     <l n="432">His age not forty-two , and in his face</l>
     <l n="433">Of care more than of age appeared the trace .</l>
     <l n="434">Mary was scarce remembered ; by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="435">The sights and sounds of life began to please .</l>
     <l n="436">Ruth was a widow , who , in youth , had known 436</l>
     <l n="437">Griefs of the heart , and losses of her own .</l>
     <l n="438">She , patient , mild , compassionate , and kind ,</l>
     <l n="439">First woke to human sympathies his mind .</l>
     <l n="440">He looked affectionately , when her child 440</l>
     <l n="441">Caressed his bird , and then he stood and smiled .</l>
     <l n="442">This widow and her child , almost unknown ,</l>
     <l n="443">Lived in a cottage that adjoined his own .</l>
     <l n="444">Her husband was a fisher , one whose life</l>
     <l n="445">Is fraught with terror to an anxious wife :</l>
     <l n="446">Night after night exposed upon the main ;</l>
     <l n="447">Returning , tired with toil , or drenched with rain ;</l>
     <l n="448">His gains , uncertain as his life ; he knows</l>
     <l n="449">No stated hours of labour and repose .</l>
     <l n="450">When others to a cheerful home retire , 450</l>
     <l n="451">And his wife sits before the evening fire ,</l>
     <l n="452">He , rocking in the dark , tempestuous night ,</l>
     <l n="453">Haply is thinking of that social light .</l>
     <l n="454">Ruth 's husband left the bay , the wind and rain</l>
     <l n="455">Came down , the tempest swept the howling main ;</l>
     <l n="456">The boat sank in the storm , and he was found ,</l>
     <l n="457">Below the rocks of the dark Lizard , drowned .</l>
     <l n="458">Seven years had passed , and after evening prayer ,</l>
     <l n="459">To William 's cottage Ruth would oft repair ,</l>
     <l n="460">And with her little son would sometimes stay , 460</l>
     <l n="461">Listening to tales of regions far away .</l>
     <l n="462">The wondering boy loved of those scenes to hear —</l>
     <l n="463">Of battles — of the roving buccaneer —</l>
     <l n="464">Of the wild hunters , in the forest-glen ,</l>
     <l n="465">And fires , and dances of the savage men .</l>
     <l n="466">So William spoke of perils he had passed ,—</l>
     <l n="467">Of voices heard amid the roaring blast ;</l>
     <l n="468">Of those who , lonely and of hope bereft ,</l>
     <l n="469">Upon some melancholy rock are left ,</l>
     <l n="470">Who mark , despairing , at the close of day , 470</l>
     <l n="471">Perhaps , some far-off vessel sail away .</l>
     <l n="472">He spoke with pity of the land of slaves —</l>
     <l n="473">And of the phantom-ship that rides the waves .<span corresp="#note70" type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span></l>
     <l n="474">It comes ! it comes ! A melancholy light</l>
     <l n="475">Gleams from the prow upon the storm of night .</l>
     <l n="476">‘ Tis here ! ‘ tis there ! In vain the billows roll ;</l>
     <l n="477">It steers right on , but not a living soul</l>
     <l n="478">Is there to guide its voyage through the dark ,</l>
     <l n="479">Or spread the sails of that mysterious bark !</l>
     <l n="480">He spoke of vast sea-serpents , how they float 480</l>
     <l n="481">For many a rood , or near some hurrying boat</l>
     <l n="482">Lift up their tall neck , with a hissing sound ,</l>
     <l n="483">And questing turn their bloodshot eye-balls round .</l>
     <l n="484">He spoke of sea-maids , on the desert rocks ,</l>
     <l n="485">Who in the sun comb their green dripping locks ,</l>
     <l n="486">While , heard at distance , in the parting ray ,</l>
     <l n="487">Beyond the furthest promontory 's bay ,</l>
     <l n="488">Aerial music swells and dies away !</l>
     <l n="489">One night they longer stayed the tale to hear ,</l>
     <l n="490">And Ruth that night “ beguiled him of a tear , 490</l>
     <l n="491">Whene'er he told of the distressful stroke</l>
     <l n="492">Which his youth suffered . ” Then , she pitying spoke ;</l>
     <l n="493">And from that night a softer feeling grew ,</l>
     <l n="494">As calmer prospects rose within his view .</l>
     <l n="495">And why not , ere the long night of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="496">The slow descent of life together tread ?</l>
     <l n="497">The day is fixed ; William no more shall roam ,</l>
     <l n="498">William and Ruth shall have one heart — one home :</l>
     <l n="499">The world shut out , both shall together pray :</l>
     <l n="500">Both wait the evening of life 's changeful day : 500</l>
     <l n="501">She shall his anguish soothe , when he is wild ,</l>
     <l n="502">And he shall be a father to her child .</l>
     <l n="503">Fair rose the morn — the summer air how bland ! 503</l>
     <l n="504">The blue wave scarcely seems to touch the land .</l>
     <l n="505">Again ‘ tis William 's wedding-day ! advance —</l>
     <l n="506">For lo ! the church and blue slate of Penzance !</l>
     <l n="507">Their faith and troth is pledged , the rites are o'er ,</l>
     <l n="508">The nuptial band winds slow along the shore ,</l>
     <l n="509">The smiling boy beside . As thus they passed ,</l>
     <l n="510">With sudden blackness rushed the impetuous blast ;<span corresp="#note71" type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>510</l>
     <l n="511">Deep thunder rolled in long portentous sound ,</l>
     <l n="512">At distance : nearer now , it shakes the ground .</l>
     <l n="513">Pale , William sinks , with speechless dread oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="514">As the forked flash seems darted at his breast .</l>
     <l n="515">His beating heart is heard ,— blanched is his cheek ,—</l>
     <l n="516">A well-known voice seemed in the storm to speak ;</l>
     <l n="517">Aghast he cried again , with frantic look ,</l>
     <l n="518">Oh ! shut the book , dear Mary , shut the book !</l>
     <l n="519">By late remorse he died ; for , from that day ,</l>

      <l n="548">No object on the wider sea-line meets</l>
      <l n="549">The straining vision , but one distant ship ,</l>
      <l n="550">Hanging , as motionless and still , far off ,</l>
      <l n="551">In the pale haze , between the sea and sky .</l>
      <l n="552">She seems the ship — the very ship I saw</l>
      <l n="553">In infancy , and in that very place ,</l>
      <l n="554">Whilst I , and all around me , have grown old</l>
      <l n="555">Since she was first descried ; and there she sits ,</l>
      <l n="556">A solitary thing of the wide main —</l>
      <l n="557">As she sat years ago . Yet she moves on :— 20</l>
      <l n="558">To-morrow all may be one waste of waves !</l>
      <l n="559">Where is she bound ? We know not ; and no voice 22</l>
      <l n="560">Will tell us where . Perhaps she beats her way</l>
      <l n="561">Slow up the channel , after many years ,</l>
      <l n="562">Returning from some distant clime , or lands ,</l>
      <l n="563">Beyond the Atlantic ! Oh ! what anxious eyes</l>

      <l n="565">How many anxious hearts this moment beat</l>
      <l n="566">With thronging thoughts of home , till those fixed eyes ,</l>
      <l n="567">Intensely fixed upon these very hills , 30</l>
      <l n="568">Are filled with tears ! Perhaps she wanders on —</l>
      <l n="569">On — on — into the world of the vast sea ,</l>
      <l n="570">There to be lost : never , with homeward sails ,</l>
      <l n="571">Destined to greet these far-seen hills again ,</l>
      <l n="572">Now fading into mist ! So let her speed ,</l>
      <l n="573">And we will pray she may return in joy ,</l>
      <l n="574">When every storm is past ! Such is this sea ,</l>
      <l n="575">That shows one wandering ship ! How different smile</l>

      <l n="581">Upon the light blue wave , as when of yore ,</l>
      <l n="582">Beneath their arch , King Canute sat ,<span corresp="#note74" type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>and chid</l>

      <l n="586">There , while a crowd of glancing vessels glide ,</l>
      <l n="587">Filled with the young and gay , and pennants wave , 50</l>
      <l n="588">And sails , at distance , beautifully swell</l>
      <l n="589">To the light breeze , or pass , like butterflies ,</l>
      <l n="590">Amid the smoking steamers . And , oh look !—</l>
      <l n="591">Look ! what a fairy lady is that yacht</l>
      <l n="592">That turns the wooded point , and silently 55</l>
      <l n="593">Streams up the sylvan Itchin ; silently —</l>
      <l n="594">And yet as if she said , as she went on ,</l>
      <l n="595">Who does not gaze at me !</l>
      <l n="596">Yon winding sands</l>
      <l n="597">Were solitary once , as the wide sea . 60</l>
      <l n="598">Such I remember them ! No sound was heard ,</l>
      <l n="599">Save of the sea-gull warping on the wind ,</l>
      <l n="600">Or of the surge that broke along the shore ,</l>
      <l n="601">Sad as the seas ; and can I e'er forget ,</l>
      <l n="602">When , once , a visitor from Oxenford ,</l>
      <l n="603">Proud of Wintonian scholarship , a youth ,</l>
      <l n="604">Silent , but yet light-hearted , deeming here</l>
      <l n="605">I could have no companion fit for him —</l>
      <l n="606">So whispered youthful vanity — for him</l>
      <l n="607">Whom Oxford<span corresp="#note75" type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>had distinguished ,— can my heart 70</l>
      <l n="608">Forget when once , with thoughts like these , at morn ,</l>
      <l n="609">I wandered forth alone ! The first ray shone</l>
      <l n="610">On the white sea-gull 's wing , and gazing round ,</l>
      <l n="611">I listened to the tide 's advancing roar ,</l>
      <l n="612">When , for the old and booted fisherman ,</l>
      <l n="613">Who silent dredged for shrimps , in the cold haze</l>
      <l n="614">Of sunrise , I beheld — or was it not</l>
      <l n="615">A momentary vision ?— a fair form —</l>
      <l n="616">A female , following , with light , airy step ,</l>
      <l n="617">The wave as it retreated , and again 80</l>
      <l n="618">Tripping before it , till it touched her foot ,</l>
      <l n="619">As if in play ; and she stood beautiful ,</l>
      <l n="620">Like to a fairy sea-maid of the deep ,</l>
      <l n="621">Graceful , and young , and on the sands alone .</l>
      <l n="622">I looked that she would vanish ! She had left ,</l>
      <l n="623">Like me , just left the abode of discipline ,</l>
      <l n="624">And came , in the gay fulness of her heart ,</l>
      <l n="625">When the pale light first glanced along the wave , 88</l>
      <l n="626">To play with the wild ocean , like a child ;</l>
      <l n="627">And though I knew her not , I vowed ( oh , hear ,</l>
      <l n="628">Ye votaries of German sentiment ! ) —</l>
      <l n="629">Vowed an eternal love ; but , diffident ,</l>
      <l n="630">I cast a parting look , that seemed to say ,</l>
      <l n="631">Shall we ne'er meet again ? The vision smiled ,</l>
      <l n="632">And left the scene to solitude . Once more</l>
      <l n="633">We met , and then we parted , in this world</l>
      <l n="634">To meet no more ; and that fair form , that shone</l>
      <l n="635">The vision of a moment , on the sands ,</l>
      <l n="636">Was never seen again ! Now it has passed</l>
      <l n="637">Where all things are forgotten ; but it shone 100</l>
      <l n="638">To me a sparkle of the morning sun ,</l>
      <l n="639">That trembled on the light wave yesterday ,</l>
      <l n="640">And perished there for ever !</l>
      <l n="641">Look around !</l>
      <l n="642">Above the winding reach of Severn stands ,</l>
      <l n="643">With massy fragments of forsaken towers ,</l>
      <l n="644">Thy castle , solitary Walton . Hark !</l>
      <l n="645">Through the lone ivied arch , was it the wind</l>
      <l n="646">Came fitful ! There , by moonlight , we might stand ,</l>
      <l n="647">And deem it some old castle of romance ; 110</l>
      <l n="648">And on the glimmering ledge of yonder rock ,</l>
      <l n="649">Above the wave , fancy it was the form</l>
      <l n="650">Of a spectre-lady , for a moment seen ,</l>
      <l n="651">Lifting her bloody dagger , then with shrieks</l>
      <l n="652">Vanishing ! Hush ! there is no sound — no sound</l>
      <l n="653">But of the Severn sweeping onward ! Look !</l>
      <l n="654">There is no bleeding apparition there —</l>
      <l n="655">No fiery phantoms glare along thy walls !</l>
      <l n="656">Surrounded by the works of silent art ,</l>
      <l n="657">And far , far more endearing , by a group 120</l>
      <l n="658">Of breathing children , their possessor lives ;<span corresp="#note76" type="note_anchor">[ 76 ]</span>121</l>
      <l n="659">And ill should I deserve the name of bard —</l>
      <l n="660">Of courtly bard , if I could touch this theme</l>
      <l n="661">Without a prayer — an earnest , heartfelt prayer ,</l>
      <l n="662">When one , whose smile I never saw but once ,</l>
      <l n="663">Yet cannot well forget , when one now blooms —</l>
      <l n="664">Unlike the spectre-lady of the rock —</l>
      <l n="665">A living and a lovely bride !<span corresp="#note77" type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span></l>
      <l n="666">How proud ,</l>
      <l n="667">Opposed to Walton 's silent towers , how proud , 130</l>
      <l n="668">With all her spires and fanes , and volumed smoke ,</l>
      <l n="669">Trailing in columns to the midday sun ,</l>
      <l n="670">Black , or pale blue , above the cloudy haze ,</l>
      <l n="671">And the great stir of commerce , and the noise</l>
      <l n="672">Of passing and repassing wains , and cars ,</l>
      <l n="673">And sledges , grating in their underpath ,</l>
      <l n="674">And trade 's deep murmur , and a street of masts</l>
      <l n="675">And pennants from all nations of the earth ,</l>
      <l n="676">Streaming below the houses , piled aloft ,</l>
      <l n="677">Hill above hill ; and every road below 140</l>
      <l n="678">Gloomy with troops of coal-nymphs , seated high</l>
      <l n="679">On their rough pads , in dingy dust serene :—</l>

      <l n="681">Bristol , through all whose smoke , dark and aloof ,</l>
      <l n="682">Stands Redcliff 's solemn fane ,— how proudly girt</l>
      <l n="683">With villages , and Clifton 's airy rocks ,</l>

      <l n="685">Bristol , amid her merchant-palaces ,</l>
      <l n="686">That ancient city sits !</l>
      <l n="687">From out those trees , 150</l>
      <l n="688">Look ! Congresbury lifts its slender spire !</l>
      <l n="689">How many woody glens and nooks of shade , 152</l>
      <l n="690">With transient sunshine , fill the interval ,</l>
      <l n="691">As rich as Poussin 's landscapes ! Gnarled oaks ,</l>
      <l n="692">Dark , or with fits of desultory light</l>
      <l n="693">Flung through the branches , there o'erhang the road ,</l>
      <l n="694">Where sheltered , as romantic , Brockley-Coombe</l>
      <l n="695">Allures the lingering traveller to wind ,</l>
      <l n="696">Step by step , up its sylvan hollow , slow ,</l>

      <l n="701">While the gray heron up shoots , and screams for joy !</l>
      <l n="702">There the dark yew starts from the limestone rock</l>
      <l n="703">Into faint sunshine ; there the ivy hangs</l>
      <l n="704">From the old oak , whose upper branches , bare ,</l>
      <l n="705">Seem as admonishing the nether woods</l>
      <l n="706">Of Time 's swift pace ; while dark and deep beneath</l>
      <l n="707">The fearful hollow yawns , upon whose edge 170</l>
      <l n="708">One peeping cot sends up , from out the fern ,</l>
      <l n="709">Its early wreath of slow-ascending smoke .</l>
      <l n="710">And who lives in that far-secluded cot ?</l>

      <l n="720">The rocks , that stern in desolation frown ,</l>
      <l n="721">Through the deep solitude of Goblin-Coombe ,<span corresp="#note78" type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span></l>

      <l n="732">Is that a magic garden on the edge</l>
      <l n="733">Of Mendip hung ? Even so it seems to gleam ;</l>

      <l n="735">( Wrington , the birth-place of immortal Locke ) ,</l>
      <l n="736">Chequers the village-crofts and lowly glens</l>
      <l n="737">With porch of flowers , and bird-cage , at the door , 200</l>
      <l n="738">That seems to say — England , with all thy crimes ,</l>

      <l n="763">Like some sweet melody of olden times ,</l>

     <l n="1">The music of “ Lang Syne ! ” Oh ! long ago</l>
     <l n="2">It died away — died , and was heard no more !</l>
     <l n="3">And where those hills that skirt the level vale ,</l>
     <l n="4">On to the left , the prospect intercept ,</l>
     <l n="5">I would not , could not look , were they removed ;</l>
     <l n="6">I would not , could not look , lest I should see</l>
     <l n="7">The sunshine on that spot of all the world ,</l>
     <l n="8">Where , starting from the dream of youth , I gazed</l>
     <l n="9">Long since , on the cold , clouded world , and cried ,</l>
     <l n="10">Beautiful vision , loved , adored , in vain , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Farewell — farewell , for ever !</l>
     <l n="12">How sincere ,</l>
     <l n="13">How pure was my heart 's love ! oh ! was it not ?</l>
     <l n="14">Yes ; Heaven can witness , now my brow is changed ,</l>
     <l n="15">And I look back , and almost seem to hear</l>
     <l n="16">The music of the days when we were young ,</l>
     <l n="17">Like music in a dream , ere we awoke ,</l>
     <l n="18">Oh ! witness , Heaven , how fervent , how sincere —</l>
     <l n="19">How fervent , and how tender , and how pure , 19</l>
     <l n="20">Was my fond heart 's first love !</l>
     <l n="21">The summer eve</l>
     <l n="22">Shone , as with sympathy of sweet farewell ,</l>
     <l n="23">Upon thy Tor , and solitary mound ,</l>
     <l n="24">Glaston , as rapidly I passed along ,</l>
     <l n="25">Borne from those scenes for ever , while with song</l>
     <l n="26">The sorrows of the hour and way beguiled .</l>
     <l n="27">So passed the days of youth , which ne'er return ,</l>
     <l n="28">Tearful ; for worldly fortune smiled too late ,</l>
     <l n="29">And the poor minstrel-boy had then no wealth ,</l>
     <l n="30">Save such as poets dream of — love and hope . 30</l>
     <l n="31">At Fortune 's frown , the wreath which Hope entwined</l>
     <l n="32">Lay withering , for the dream had been too sweet</l>
     <l n="33">For human life ; yet never , though his love ,</l>
     <l n="34">All his fond love , he muttered to the winds ;</l>
     <l n="35">Though oft he strove , distempered , without joy ,</l>
     <l n="36">To drown even the remembrance that he lived —</l>
     <l n="37">Never a weak complaint escaped his lip ,</l>
     <l n="38">Save that some tender tones , as he passed on ,</l>
     <l n="39">Died on his desultory lyre .</l>
     <l n="40">No more ! 40</l>
     <l n="41">Forget the shadows of a feverish dream ,</l>
     <l n="42">That long has passed away ! Uplift the eyes</l>
     <l n="43">To Him who sits above the water flood ,—</l>
     <l n="44">To Him who was , and is , and is to come !</l>
     <l n="45">Wrapped in the view of ages that are passed ,</l>
     <l n="46">And marking here the record of earth 's doom ,</l>
     <l n="47">Let us , even now , think that we hear the sound —</l>
     <l n="48">The sound of the great flood , the peopled earth</l>
     <l n="49">Covering and surging in its solitude !</l>
     <l n="50">Let us forget the passing hour , the stir 50</l>
     <l n="51">Of this tumultuous scene of human things ,</l>
     <l n="52">And bid imagination lift the veil 52</l>
     <l n="53">Spread o'er the rolling globe four thousand years !</l>
     <l n="54">The vision of the deluge ! Hark — a trump !</l>
     <l n="55">It was the trump of the Archangel ! Stern</l>
     <l n="56">He stands , whilst the awakening thunder rolls</l>
     <l n="57">Beneath his feet ! Stern , and alone , he stands</l>
     <l n="58">Upon Imaus ’ height !</l>
     <l n="59">No voice is heard</l>
     <l n="60">Of revelry or blasphemy so high ! 60</l>
     <l n="61">He sounds again his trumpet ; and the clouds</l>
     <l n="62">Come deepening o'er the world !</l>
     <l n="63">Why art thou pale ?</l>
     <l n="64">A strange and fearful stillness is on earth ,</l>
     <l n="65">As if the shadow of the Almighty passed</l>
     <l n="66">O'er the abodes of man , and hushed at once</l>
     <l n="67">The song , the shout , the cries of violence ,</l>
     <l n="68">The groan of the oppressed , and the deep curse</l>
     <l n="69">Of blasphemy , that scowls upon the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="70">And mocks the deeper thunder ! 70</l>
     <l n="71">Hark ! a voice —</l>
     <l n="72">Perish ! Again the thunder rolls ; the earth</l>
     <l n="73">Answers , from north to south , from east to west —</l>
     <l n="74">Perish ! The fountains of the mighty deep</l>
     <l n="75">Are broken up ; the rushing rains descend ,</l>
     <l n="76">Like night — deep night ; while , momentary seen ,</l>
     <l n="77">Through blacker clouds , on his pale phantom-horse ,</l>
     <l n="78">Death , a gigantic skeleton , rides on ,</l>
     <l n="79">Rejoicing , where the millions of mankind —</l>
     <l n="80">Visible , where his lightning-arrows glared — 80</l>
     <l n="81">Welter beneath the shadow of his horse !</l>
     <l n="82">Now , dismally , through all her caverns , Hell</l>
     <l n="83">Sends forth a horrid laugh , that dies away ,</l>
     <l n="84">And then a loud voice answers — Victory !</l>
     <l n="85">Victory to the rider and his horse ! 85</l>
     <l n="86">Victory to the rider and his horse !</l>
     <l n="87">Ride on :— the ark , majestic and alone</l>
     <l n="88">On the wide waste of the careering deep ,</l>
     <l n="89">Its hull scarce peering through the night of clouds ,</l>
     <l n="90">Is seen . But , lo ! the mighty deep has shrunk ! 90</l>
     <l n="91">The ark , from its terrific voyage , rests</l>
     <l n="92">On Ararat . The raven is sent forth ,—</l>
     <l n="93">Send out the dove , and as her wings far off</l>
     <l n="94">Shine in the light , that streaks the severing clouds ,</l>
     <l n="95">Bid her speed on , and greet her with a song :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="96">Go , beautiful and gentle dove ;</l>
     <l n="97">But whither wilt thou go ?</l>
     <l n="98">For though the clouds ride high above ,</l>
     <l n="99">How sad and waste is all below !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="100">The wife of Shem , a moment to her breast 100</l>
     <l n="101">Held the poor bird , and kissed it . Many a night</l>
     <l n="102">When she was listening to the hollow wind ,</l>
     <l n="103">She pressed it to her bosom , with a tear ;</l>
     <l n="104">Or when it murmured in her hand , forgot</l>
     <l n="105">The long , loud tumult of the storm without .</l>
     <l n="106">She kisses it , and at her father 's word ,</l>
     <l n="107">Bids it go forth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="108">The dove flies on ! In lonely flight</l>
     <l n="109">She flies from dawn till dark ;</l>
     <l n="110">And now , amid the gloom of night , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Comes weary to the ark .</l>
     <l n="112">Oh ! let me in , she seems to say ,</l>
     <l n="113">For long and lone hath been my way !</l>
     <l n="114">Oh ! once more , gentle mistress , let me rest ,</l>
     <l n="115">And dry my dripping plumage on thy breast !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="116">So the bird flew to her who cherished it . 116</l>
     <l n="117">She sent it forth again out of the ark ;—</l>
     <l n="118">Again it came at evening fall , and , lo !</l>
     <l n="119">An olive-leaf plucked off , and in its bill .</l>
     <l n="120">And Shem 's wife took the green leaf from its bill , 120</l>
     <l n="121">And kissed its wings again , and smilingly</l>
     <l n="122">Dropped on its neck one silent tear for joy .</l>
     <l n="123">She sent it forth once more ; and watched its flight ,</l>
     <l n="124">Till it was lost amid the clouds of heaven :</l>
     <l n="125">Then gazing on the clouds where it was lost ,</l>
     <l n="126">Its mournful mistress sung this last farewell :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="127">Go , beautiful and gentle dove ,</l>
     <l n="128">And greet the morning ray ;</l>
     <l n="129">For , lo ! the sun shines bright above ,</l>
     <l n="130">And night and storm have passed away . 130</l>
     <l n="131">No longer , drooping , here confined ,</l>
     <l n="132">In this cold prison dwell ;</l>
     <l n="133">Go , free to sunshine and to wind ,</l>
     <l n="134">Sweet bird , go forth , and fare thee well !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="135">Oh ! beautiful and gentle dove ,</l>
     <l n="136">Thy welcome sad will be ,</l>
     <l n="137">When thou shalt hear no voice of love ,</l>
     <l n="138">In murmurs from the leafy tree :</l>
     <l n="139">Yet freedom , freedom shalt thou find ,</l>
     <l n="140">From this cold prison 's cell ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Go , then , to sunshine and the wind ,</l>
     <l n="142">Sweet bird , go forth , and fare thee well !<span corresp="#note86" type="note_anchor">[ 86 ]</span></l>

     <l n="143">And never more she saw it ; for the earth</l>
     <l n="144">Was dry , and now , upon the mountain 's van ,</l>
     <l n="145">Again the great Archangel stands ; the light</l>
     <l n="146">Of the moist rainbow glitters on his hair — 146</l>
     <l n="147">He to the bow uplifts his hands , whose arch</l>
     <l n="148">Spans the whole heaven ; and whilst , far off , in light ,</l>
     <l n="149">The ascending dove is for a moment seen ,</l>
     <l n="150">The last rain falls — falls , gently and unheard . 150</l>
     <l n="151">Amid the silent sunshine ! Oh ! look up !—</l>
     <l n="152">Above the clouds , borne up the depth of light ,</l>
     <l n="153">Behold a cross !— and round about the cross ,</l>
     <l n="154">Lo ! angels and archangels jubilant ,</l>
     <l n="155">Till the ascending pomp in light is lost ,</l>
     <l n="156">Lift their acclaiming voice — Glory to thee ,</l>
     <l n="157">Glory , and praise , and honour be to thee ,</l>
     <l n="158">Lord God of hosts ; we laud and magnify</l>
     <l n="159">Thy glorious name , praising Thee evermore ,</l>
     <l n="160">For the great dragon is cast down , and hell 160</l>
     <l n="161">Vanquished beneath thy cross , Lord Jesus Christ !</l>
     <l n="162">Hark ! the clock strikes ! The shadowy scene dissolves ,</l>
     <l n="163">And all the visionary pomp is past !</l>
     <l n="164">I only see a few sheep on the edge</l>
     <l n="165">Of this aerial ridge , and Banwell Tower ,</l>
     <l n="166">Gray in the morning sunshine , at our feet .</l>
     <l n="167">Farewell to Banwell Cave , and Banwell Hill ,</l>
     <l n="168">And Banwell Church ;<span corresp="#note87" type="note_anchor">[ 87 ]</span>and farewell to the shores</l>
     <l n="169">Where , when a child , I wandered ; and farewell ,</l>
     <l n="170">Harp of my youth ! Above this mountain-cave 170</l>
     <l n="171">I leave thee , murmuring to the fitful breeze</l>
     <l n="172">That wanders from that sea , whose sound I heard</l>
     <l n="173">So many years ago .</l>
     <l n="174">Yet , whilst the light</l>
     <l n="175">Steals from the clouds , to rest upon that tower ,</l>
     <l n="176">I turn a parting look , and lift to Heaven</l>
     <l n="177">A parting prayer , that our own Zion , thus ,—</l>
     <l n="178">With sober splendour , yet not gorgeous , 178</l>
     <l n="179">Her mitred brow tempered with lenity</l>
     <l n="180">And apostolic mildness — in her mien</l>
     <l n="181">No dark defeature , beautiful as mild ,</l>
     <l n="182">And gentle as the smile of charity ,—</l>
     <l n="183">Thus on the Rock of Ages may uplift</l>
     <l n="184">Her brow majestic , pointing to the spires</l>
     <l n="185">That grace her village glens , or solemn fanes</l>
     <l n="186">In cities , calm above the stir and smoke ,</l>
     <l n="187">And listening to deep harmonies that swell</l>
     <l n="188">From all her temples !</l>
     <l n="189">So may she adorn —</l>
     <l n="190">Her robe as graceful , as her creed is pure — 190</l>
     <l n="191">This happy land , till time shall be no more !</l>
     <l n="192">And whilst her gray cathedrals rise in air ,</l>
     <l n="193">Solemn , august , and beautiful , and touched</l>
     <l n="194">By time , to show a grace , but no decay ,</l>
     <l n="195">Like that fair pile , which , from hoar Mendip 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="196">The traveller beholds , crowning the vale</l>
     <l n="197">Of Avalon , with all its towers in light ;</l>
     <l n="198">So , England , may thy gray cathedrals lift</l>
     <l n="199">Their front in heaven 's pure light , and ever boast</l>
     <l n="200">Such prelate-lords — bland , but yet dignified — 200</l>
     <l n="201">Pious , paternal , and beloved , as he</l>
     <l n="202">Who prompted , and forgives , this Severn song !</l>
     <l n="203">And thou , O Lord and Saviour ! on whose rock</l>
     <l n="204">That Church is founded , though the storm without</l>
     <l n="205">May howl around its battlements , preserve</l>
     <l n="206">Its spirit , and still pour into the hearts</l>
     <l n="207">Of all , who there confess thy holy name ,</l>
     <l n="208">Peace , that , through evil or through good report ,</l>
     <l n="209">They may hold on their blameless way !</l>
     <l n="210">For me , 210</l>
     <l n="211">Though disappointment , like a morning cloud ,</l>
     <l n="212">Hung on my early hopes , that cloud is passed ,—</l>
     <l n="213">Is passed , but not forgotten ,— and the light</l>
     <l n="214">Is calm , not cold , which rests upon the scene ,</l>
     <l n="215">Soon to be ended . I may wake no more</l>
     <l n="216">The melody of song on earth ; but Thee ,</l>
     <l n="217">Father of Heaven , and Saviour , at this hour ,</l>
     <l n="218">Father and Lord , I thank Thee that no song</l>
     <l n="219">Of mine , from youth to age , has left a stain</l>
     <l n="220">I would blot out ; and grateful for the good</l>
     <l n="221">Thy providence , through many years , has lent ,</l>
     <l n="222">Humbly I wait the close , till Thy high will</l>
     <l n="223">Dismiss me ,— blessed if , when that hour shall come ,</l>
     <l n="224">My life may plead , far better than my song .</l>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>GRAVE OF THE LAST SAXON ;</p>
   <p>OR ,</p>
   <p>THE LEGEND OF THE CURFEW .</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION .</p>
   <p>The circumstance of the late critical controversy with Lord Byron having recalled my attention to a poem , sketched some years ago , on a subject of national history , I have been induced to revise and correct , and now venture to offer it to the public .</p>
   <p>The subject , though taken from an early period of our history , is , so far as relates to the grave of Harold , purely imaginary , as are all the characters , except those of the Conqueror , and of Edgar Atheling . History , I think , justifies me in representing William as acting constantly under strong religious impressions . A few circumstances in his life will clearly show this . When Harold was with him in Normandy , he took an oath of him on two altars , within which were concealed miraculous relics .<span corresp="#note88" type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span>His banner was sent from Rome , consecrated by the Pope , for the especial purpose of the invasion of England . Without adverting to the night spent in prayer before the battle of Hastings , was not this impression more decidedly shown when he pitched his tent among the dead on that night , and vowed to build an abbey on the spot ? The event of the battle was so much against all human probability , that his undertaking it , at the place and time , can only be reconciled by supposing that he acted under some extraordinary impression .</p>
   <p>When the battle was gained , he knew not on what course to determine : instead of marching to London , he retired towards Dover . When he was met by the Kentish men , with green boughs , the quaint historian says , “ He was daunted . ” These and many other incidental circumstances may occur to the reader .</p>
   <p>In representing him , therefore , as under the control of superstitious impressions , I trust I have not transgressed , at least , poetical verisimilitude . An earthquake actually happened about the period at which the poem commences , followed by storms and inundations . Of these facts I have availed myself .</p>
   <p>I fear the poem will be thought less interesting , from having nothing of love in it , except , in accordance with the received ideas of the gentleness of Atheling 's character , I have made him not insensible to one of my imaginary females ; and have , therefore , to mark his character , made him advert to the pastoral scenes of Scotland , where he had been a resident . There is a similarity between my “ Monk , ” and “ The Missionary , ” but their offices and the scenes are entirely different , and some degree of resemblance was unavoidable in characters of the same description .</p>
   <p>Filial affection , love of our country , bravery , sternness ( inflexible , except under religions fears ) ; the loftier feelings of a desolate female , under want and affliction , with something of the wild prophetical cast ; religious submission , and deep acquiescence in the will of God ;— these passions are brought into action , around one centre , if I may use the word , THE GRAVE OF THE LAST SAXON .</p>
   <p>That Harold 's sons landed with a large fleet from Denmark , and were joined by an immense confederate army , in the third year of William 's reign , is a well-known historical fact . That York was taken by the confederate army , and that all the Normans , except Sir William Malet , and his family , were killed , is also matter of record .<span corresp="#note89" type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>That afterwards , the blow against William failing , the whole country , from the Humber to Tyne , from the east to the west , was depopulated by sword and famine , are facts which are also to be found in all historians .</p>
   <p>Some slight anachronisms may I hope , be pardoned — if anachronisms they are — such as the year in which the Tower was built , etc .</p>
   <p>The plan of the Poem will be found , I trust , simple and coherent , the characters sufficiently marked and contrasted , and the whole conducive , however deficient in other respects , to the excitement of virtuous sympathy , and subservient to that which alone can give dignity to poetry — the cause of moral and religious truth .</p>

      <l n="236">Atheling answered : They will soon appear ; 52</l>

      <l n="323">Of our poor country . Give me men and ships !</l>
      <l n="324">Godwin still cried ; oh ! give me men and ships ! 140</l>
      <l n="325">The king commanded , and his armament —</l>
      <l n="326">A mightier never stemmed the Baltic deep ,</l>
      <l n="327">Sent forth by sea-kings of the north , or bent</l>
      <l n="328">On hardier enterprise ; for not some isle</l>

      <l n="330">But England 's throne .</l>
      <l n="331">His mighty armament</l>
      <l n="332">Now left the shores of Denmark . Our brave ships</l>
      <l n="333">Burst through the Baltic straits , how gloriously !</l>
      <l n="334">I heard the trumpets ring ; I saw the sails 150</l>
      <l n="335">Of nigh three hundred war-ships , the dim verge</l>
      <l n="336">Of the remote horizon 's skiey track 152</l>

      <l n="339">On the gray waste of waters . So our ships</l>
      <l n="340">Swept o'er the billows of the north , and steered</l>
      <l n="341">Right on to England .</l>
      <l n="342">Foremost of the fleet</l>
      <l n="343">Our gallant vessel rode ; around the mast</l>
      <l n="344">Emblazoned shields were ranged , and plumed crests 160</l>

      <l n="349">And parted . The broad banner , in full length ,</l>
      <l n="350">Streamed out its folds , on which the Saxon horse</l>
      <l n="351">Ramped , as impatient on the land to leap ,</l>
      <l n="352">To which the winds still bore it bravely on ;</l>

      <l n="369">When the fourth morning gleamed along the deep ,</l>
      <l n="370">England , Old England ! burst the general cry : 186</l>
      <l n="371">England , Old England ! Every eye , intent ,</l>
      <l n="372">Was turned ; and Godwin pointed with his sword</l>
      <l n="373">To Flamborough , pale rising o'er the surge .</l>
      <l n="374">Nearer into the kingdom 's heart bear on</l>
      <l n="375">The death-storm of our vengeance ! Godwin cried .</l>
      <l n="376">Soon , like a cloud , the northern Foreland rose —</l>
      <l n="377">Know ye those cliffs , towering in giant state !</l>
      <l n="378">But , hark ! along the shores alarum-bells</l>
      <l n="379">Ring out more loud , blast answers blast , the swords</l>
      <l n="380">Of hurrying horsemen , and projected spears ,</l>
      <l n="381">Flash to the sun . On yonder castle walls</l>
      <l n="382">A thousand bows are bent ; again our course</l>
      <l n="383">Back to the north is turned . Now twilight veiled</l>
      <l n="384">The sinking sands of Yarmouth , and we heard 200</l>
      <l n="385">A long deep toll from many a village tower</l>
      <l n="386">On shore — and , lo ! the scattered inland lights ,</l>
      <l n="387">That sprinkled winding ocean 's lowly verge ,</l>
      <l n="388">At once are lost in darkness . God in heaven ,</l>
      <l n="389">It is the curfew ! Godwin cried , and smote</l>
      <l n="390">His forehead . We all heard that sullen sound</l>
      <l n="391">For the first time , that night ; but the winds blew ,</l>
      <l n="392">Our ship sailed out of hearing ; yet we thought</l>
      <l n="393">Of the poor mother , who , on winter nights ,</l>
      <l n="394">When her belated husband from the wood 210</l>
      <l n="395">Was not come back , her lonely taper lit ,</l>
      <l n="396">And turned the glass , and saw the faggot-flame</l>
      <l n="397">Shine on the faces of her little ones :</l>
      <l n="398">Those times will ne'er return .</l>
      <l n="399">Darkness descends ;</l>
      <l n="400">Again the sun is rising o'er the waves ;</l>
      <l n="401">And now hoarse Humber roars beneath our keels ,</l>
      <l n="402">And we have landed</l>
      <l n="403">Yea , and struck a blow , 219</l>
      <l n="404">Such as may make the crowned Conqueror quail ,</l>
      <l n="405">Edgar replied .</l>
      <l n="406">Grant Heaven that we may live ,</l>

      <l n="415">And this bare head , the night of time descends</l>
      <l n="416">In sorrow . I look back upon the past ,</l>
      <l n="417">And think of joy and sadness upon earth ,</l>
      <l n="418">Like the vast ocean 's fluctuating toil</l>
      <l n="419">From everlasting ! I have seen its waste</l>
      <l n="420">Now in the sunshine sleeping ; now high-ridged</l>
      <l n="421">With storms ; and such the kingdoms of the earth .</l>
      <l n="422">Yes , youth , and flattering fortune , and the light</l>
      <l n="423">Of summer days , are as the radiance</l>
      <l n="424">That flits along the solitary waves , 240</l>
      <l n="425">Even whilst we gaze , and say , How beautiful !</l>
      <l n="426">So fitful and so perishing the dream</l>
      <l n="427">Of human things ! But there is light above ,</l>
      <l n="428">Undying ; and , at times , faint harmonies</l>
      <l n="429">Heard , by the weary pilgrim , in his way</l>
      <l n="430">O'er perilous rocks , and through unwatered wastes ,</l>
      <l n="431">Who looks up , fainting , and prays earnestly</l>
      <l n="432">To pass into that rest , whence sounds so sweet</l>
      <l n="433">Come , whispering of hope ; else it were best</l>
      <l n="434">Beneath the load the forlorn heart endures 250</l>
      <l n="435">To sink at once ; to shut the eyes on things</l>
      <l n="436">That sear the sight ; and so to wrap the soul</l>
      <l n="437">In sullen , tearless , ruthless apathy ! 253</l>
      <l n="438">Therefore , ‘ midst every human change , I drop</l>
      <l n="439">A tear upon the cross , and all is calm ;</l>
      <l n="440">Yea , full of blissful and of brightest views ,</l>
      <l n="441">On this dark tide of time .</l>
      <l n="442">Youth , thou hast known</l>
      <l n="443">Adversity ; even in thy morn of life ,</l>
      <l n="444">The springtide rainbow fades , and many days , 260</l>
      <l n="445">And many years , perchance , of weal or woe</l>
      <l n="446">Hang o'er thee ! happy , if through every change</l>

      <l n="455">The red portentous comet ,<span corresp="#note97" type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span>like the hand</l>
      <l n="456">Upon the wall , came forth : its fatal course</l>
      <l n="457">All marked , and gazed in terror , as it looked</l>
      <l n="458">With lurid light upon this land . It passed ;</l>
      <l n="459">Old men had many bodings ; but I saw ,</l>
      <l n="460">Reckless , King Harold , in his plumed helm ,</l>
      <l n="461">Ride foremost of the mailed chivalry ,</l>
      <l n="462">That , when the fierce Norwegian passed the seas ,</l>
      <l n="463">Met his host man to man ; I saw the sword ,</l>
      <l n="464">Advanced and glittering , in the victor 's hand , 280</l>
      <l n="465">That smote the Hardrada<span corresp="#note98" type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span>to the earth ! To-day</l>
      <l n="466">King Harold rose , like an avenging God ;</l>
      <l n="467">To-morrow ( so it seemed , so short the space ) , 283</l>
      <l n="468">To-morrow , through the field of blood , we sought</l>
      <l n="469">His mangled corse amid the heaps of slain :</l>
      <l n="470">Shall I recount the event more faithfully ?</l>
      <l n="471">Its spectred memory never since that hour</l>
      <l n="472">Has left my heart .</l>
      <l n="473">William was in his tent ,</l>
      <l n="474">Spread on the battle-plain , on that same night 290</l>
      <l n="475">When seventy thousand dead lay at his feet ;</l>
      <l n="476">They who , at sunrise , with bent bows and spears ,</l>
      <l n="477">Confronted and defied him , at his feet</l>
      <l n="478">Lay dead ! Alone he watches in his tent ,</l>
      <l n="479">At midnight ; ‘ midst a sight so terrible</l>
      <l n="480">We came ; we stood before him , where he sat ,</l>
      <l n="481">I and my brother Osgood . Who are ye ?</l>
      <l n="482">Sternly he asked ; and Osgood thus replied :</l>
      <l n="483">Conqueror , and lord , and soon to be a king ,</l>
      <l n="484">We , two poor monks of Waltham Abbey , kneel 300</l>
      <l n="485">Before thee , sorrowing ! He who is slain</l>
      <l n="486">To us was bountiful . He raised those walls</l>
      <l n="487">Where we devote our life to prayer and praise .</l>
      <l n="488">Oh ! by the mercies which the God of all</l>
      <l n="489">Hath shewn to thee this day , grant our request ;</l>
      <l n="490">To search for his dead body , through this field</l>
      <l n="491">Of terror , that his bones may rest with us .</l>
      <l n="492">Your king hath met the meed of broken faith ,</l>
      <l n="493">William replied . But yet he shall not want</l>
      <l n="494">A sepulchre ; and on this very spot 310</l>
      <l n="495">My purpose stands , as I have vowed to God ,</l>
      <l n="496">To build a holy monastery : here ,</l>
      <l n="497">A hundred monks shall pray for all who fell</l>
      <l n="498">In this dread strife ; and your King Harold here</l>
      <l n="499">Shall have due honours and a stately tomb .</l>
      <l n="500">Still on our knees , we answered , Oh ! not so ,</l>
      <l n="501">Dread sovereign ;— hear us , of your clemency . 317</l>
      <l n="502">We beg his body ; beg it for the sake</l>
      <l n="503">Of our successors ; beg it for ourselves ,</l>
      <l n="504">That we may bury it in the same spot</l>
      <l n="505">Himself ordained when living ; where the choirs</l>
      <l n="506">May sing for his repose , in distant years ,</l>
      <l n="507">When we are dust and ashes .</l>
      <l n="508">Then go forth ,</l>
      <l n="509">And search for him , at the first dawn of day ,</l>
      <l n="510">King William said . We crossed our breasts , and passed ,</l>
      <l n="511">Slow rising , from his presence . So we went ,</l>
      <l n="512">In silence , to the quarry of the dead .</l>
      <l n="513">The sun rose on that still and dismal host ;</l>
      <l n="514">Toiling from corse to corse , we trod in blood , 330</l>
      <l n="515">From morn till noon toiling , and then I said ,</l>
      <l n="516">Seek Editha , her whom he loved . She came ;</l>
      <l n="517">And through the field of death she passed : she looked</l>
      <l n="518">On many a face , ghastly upturned ; her hand</l>
      <l n="519">Unloosed the helmet , smoothed the clotted hair ,</l>
      <l n="520">And many livid hands she took in hers ;</l>
      <l n="521">Till , stooping o'er a mangled corse , she shrieked ,</l>
      <l n="522">Then into tears burst audibly , and turned</l>
      <l n="523">Her face , and with a faltering voice pronounced ,</l>
      <l n="524">Oh , Harold ! We took up , and bore the corse 340</l>
      <l n="525">From that sad spot , and washed the ghastly wound</l>
      <l n="526">Deep in the forehead , where the broken barb</l>
      <l n="527">Was fixed .</l>
      <l n="528">So weltering from the field , we bore</l>
      <l n="529">King Harold 's corse . A hundred Norman knights</l>
      <l n="530">Met the sad train , with pikes that trailed the ground .</l>
      <l n="531">Our old men prayed , and spoke of evil days</l>
      <l n="532">To come ; the women smote their breasts and wept ;</l>
      <l n="533">The little children knelt beside the way ,</l>
      <l n="534">As on to Waltham the funereal car 350</l>
      <l n="535">Moved slow . Few and disconsolate the train 351</l>
      <l n="536">Of English earls , for few , alas ! remained ;</l>
      <l n="537">So many in the field of death lay cold .</l>
      <l n="538">The horses slowly paced , till Waltham towers</l>
      <l n="539">Before us rose . There , with long tapered blaze ,</l>
      <l n="540">Our brethren met us , chanting , two and two ,</l>
      <l n="541">The “ Miserere ” of the dead . And there —</l>
      <l n="542">But , my child Adela , you are in tears —</l>
      <l n="543">There at the foot of the high altar lies</l>
      <l n="544">The last of Saxon kings . Sad Editha , 360</l>
      <l n="545">At distance , watched the rites , and from that hour</l>
      <l n="546">We never saw her more .</l>
      <l n="547">A distant trump</l>
      <l n="548">Now rung — again !— again !— and thrice a trump</l>
      <l n="549">Has answered from the walls of Ravenspur .</l>
      <l n="550">My brothers ! they are here ! Adela cried ,</l>
      <l n="551">And left the tower in breathless ardour . York</l>
      <l n="552">Flames to the sky ! a general voice was heard —</l>
      <l n="553">The drawbridge clanks ; into the inner court</l>
      <l n="554">A mailed man rides on — York is no more ! 370</l>
      <l n="555">The cry without redoubles . On the ground</l>
      <l n="556">The rider flung his bloody sword , and raised</l>
      <l n="557">His helm , dismounting : the first dawn of day</l>
      <l n="558">Gleamed on the shattered plume . Oh ! Adela ,</l>
      <l n="559">He cried , your brother Godwin ! and she flew ,</l>
      <l n="560">And murmuring , My brave brother ! hid her face ,</l>
      <l n="561">Clasping his mailed breast . Soon gazing round ,</l>
      <l n="562">She cried , But where is Edmund ? Was he wont</l>
      <l n="563">To linger ?</l>
      <l n="564">Edmund has a sacred charge , 380</l>
      <l n="565">Godwin replied . But trust his anxious love ,</l>
      <l n="566">We soon shall hear his voice . I need some rest —</l>
      <l n="567">‘ Tis now broad day ; but we have watched and fought :</l>
      <l n="568">I can sleep sound , though the shrill bird of morn 384</l>
      <l n="569">Mount and upbraid my slumbers with her song .</l>
      <l n="570">Tranquil and clear the autumnal day declined :</l>
      <l n="571">The barks at anchor cast their lengthened shades</l>
      <l n="572">On the gray bastioned walls ; airs from the deep</l>
      <l n="573">Wandered , and touched the cordage as they passed ,</l>
      <l n="574">Then hovered with expiring breath , and stirred 390</l>
      <l n="575">Scarce the quiescent pennant ; the bright sea</l>
      <l n="576">Lay silent in its glorious amplitude ,</l>
      <l n="577">Without ; far up , in the pale atmosphere ,</l>
      <l n="578">A white cloud , here and there , hung overhead ,</l>
      <l n="579">And some red freckles streaked the horizon 's edge ,</l>
      <l n="580">Far as the sight could reach ; beneath the rocks ,</l>
      <l n="581">That reared their dark brows beetling o'er the bay ,</l>
      <l n="582">The gulls and guillemots , with short quaint cry ,</l>
      <l n="583">Just broke the sleeping stillness of the air ,</l>
      <l n="584">Or , skimming , almost touched the level main , 400</l>
      <l n="585">With wings far seen , and more intensely white ,</l>
      <l n="586">Opposed to the blue space ; whilst Panope</l>
      <l n="587">Played in the offing . Humber 's ocean-stream ,</l>
      <l n="588">Inland , went sounding on , by rocks and sands</l>
      <l n="589">And castle , yet so sounding as it seemed</l>
      <l n="590">A voice amidst the hushed and listening world</l>
      <l n="591">That spoke of peace ; whilst from the bastion 's point</l>
      <l n="592">One piping red-breast might almost be heard .</l>
      <l n="593">Such quiet all things hushed , so peaceable</l>
      <l n="594">The hour : the very swallows , ere they leave 410</l>
      <l n="595">The coast to pass a long and weary way</l>
      <l n="596">O'er ocean 's solitude , seem to renew</l>
      <l n="597">Once more their summer feelings , as a light</l>
      <l n="598">So sweet would last for ever , whilst they flock</l>
      <l n="599">In the brief sunshine of the turret-top .</l>
      <l n="600">‘ Twas at this hour of evening , Adela</l>
      <l n="601">And Godwin , now restored by rest , went forth ,</l>
      <l n="602">Linked arm in arm , upon the eastern beach , 418</l>
      <l n="603">Beyond the headland 's shade . If such an hour</l>
      <l n="604">Seemed smiling on the heart , how smiled it now</l>
      <l n="605">To him who yesternight , a soldier , stood</l>
      <l n="606">Amid the direst sight of human strife</l>
      <l n="607">And bloodshed ; heard the cries , the trumpet 's blast ,</l>
      <l n="608">Ring o'er the dying ; saw , with all its towers ,</l>
      <l n="609">A city blazing to the midnight sky ,</l>
      <l n="610">And mangled groups of miserable men ,</l>
      <l n="611">Gasping or dead , whilst with his iron heel</l>
      <l n="612">He splashed the blood beneath ! How changed the scene !</l>
      <l n="613">The sun 's last light upon the battlements ,</l>
      <l n="614">The sea , the landscape , the peace-breathing air , 430</l>
      <l n="615">Remembered both of the departed hours</l>
      <l n="616">Of early life , when once they had a home ,</l>
      <l n="617">A country , where their father wore a crown .</l>
      <l n="618">What changes since that time , for them and all</l>
      <l n="619">They loved ! how many found an early grave ,</l>
      <l n="620">Cut off by the red sword ! how many mourned ,</l>
      <l n="621">Scattered by various fates , through distant lands !</l>
      <l n="622">How desolate their own poor country , bound</l>
      <l n="623">By the oppressor 's chain ! As thoughts like these</l>
      <l n="624">Arose , the bells of rural Nevilthorpe 440</l>
      <l n="625">Rang out a joyous peal , rang merrily ,</l>
      <l n="626">For tidings heard from York : their melody</l>
      <l n="627">Mingled with things forgotten . Until then ,</l>
      <l n="628">And then remembered freshly , Adela</l>
      <l n="629">That instant turned to hide her tears , and saw</l>
      <l n="630">Her brother Edmund leading by the hand</l>
      <l n="631">A boy of lovely mien and footstep light</l>
      <l n="632">Along the sands . My sister , Edmund cried ,</l>
      <l n="633">See here a footpage I have brought from York</l>
      <l n="634">To serve a lady fair ! The boy held out 450</l>
      <l n="635">His hand to Adela , as he would say ,</l>
      <l n="636">Look , and protect me , lady . Adela , 452</l>
      <l n="637">Advancing with a smile and glowing cheek ,</l>
      <l n="638">Cried , Welcome , truant brother ; and then took</l>
      <l n="639">The child 's right hand , and said , My pretty page ,</l>
      <l n="640">And have you not a tale to tell to me ?</l>
      <l n="641">The boy spake nothing , but looked earnestly</l>
      <l n="642">And anxiously at Edmund . Edmund said ,</l>
      <l n="643">If he is silent , I must speak for him .</l>
      <l n="644">‘ Twas when the minster flamed , and , sword in hand , 460</l>
      <l n="645">Godwin , and Waltheof , and stern Hereward ,</l>
      <l n="646">Directed the red slaughter ; black with smoke</l>
      <l n="647">I burst into the citadel , and saw ,</l>
      <l n="648">Not the grim warder , with his huge axe up ,</l>
      <l n="649">But o'er her child , a frantic mother , mute<span corresp="#note99" type="note_anchor">[ 99 ]</span></l>
      <l n="650">With horror , in delirious agony ,</l>
      <l n="651">Clasping it to her bosom ; stern and still</l>
      <l n="652">The father stood , his hand upon his brow ,</l>
      <l n="653">As praying , in that hour , that God might make ,</l>
      <l n="654">In mercy , the last trial brief . Fear not — 470</l>
      <l n="655">I am a man — nay , fear not me , I cried ,</l>
      <l n="656">And seizing this child 's hand , in safety placed ,</l>
      <l n="657">Amidst the smoke , and sounds and sights of death ,</l>
      <l n="658">Him and his mother ! She with bursting heart</l>
      <l n="659">Knelt down to bless me : when I saw that boy ,</l>
      <l n="660">So beautiful , I thought of Adela ,</l>
      <l n="661">And said , Oh ! trust with his preserver him</l>
      <l n="662">Whom every eye must view with tender love ,</l>
      <l n="663">Oh ! trust me ; for his safety , lo ! I pledge</l>
      <l n="664">My honour and my life . 480</l>
      <l n="665">And I have brought</l>
      <l n="666">My trusted charge , that you , my Adela ,</l>
      <l n="667">May show him gentler courtesy than those</l>
      <l n="668">Whom war in its stern trade has almost steeled .</l>
      <l n="669">His sister kissed the child 's light hair and cheek , 485</l>
      <l n="670">And folded his small hands in hers , and said ,</l>
      <l n="671">You shall be my true knight , and wear a plume ,</l>
      <l n="672">Wilt thou not , boy ; and for a lady 's love</l>
      <l n="673">Fight , like a valiant soldier ! I will die ,</l>
      <l n="674">The poor child said , for friends like those who saved 490</l>
      <l n="675">My father and my mother ; and again</l>
      <l n="676">Adela kissed his forehead and his eyes ,</l>
      <l n="677">And said , But we are Saxons !</l>
      <l n="678">As she spoke ,</l>
      <l n="679">The winds began to muster , and the sea</l>
      <l n="680">Swelled with a sound more solemn , whilst the sun</l>
      <l n="681">Was sinking , and its last and lurid light</l>
      <l n="682">Streaked the long line of cumbrous clouds , that hung</l>
      <l n="683">In wild red masses o'er the murmuring deep ,</l>
      <l n="684">Now flickering fast with foam . The sea-fowl flew 500</l>
      <l n="685">Rapidly on , o'er the black-lifted surge ,</l>
      <l n="686">Borne down the wind , and then was seen no more .</l>
      <l n="687">Meantime the dark deep wilder heaves , and , hark !</l>
      <l n="688">Heavily overhead the gathered storm</l>
      <l n="689">Comes sounding !</l>
      <l n="690">Haste !— and in the castle-keep</l>
      <l n="691">List to the winds and waves that roar without .</l>

     <l n="1">Around , around , around ,</l>
     <l n="2">Dance we to the dismal sound</l>

     <l n="6">That night , King William first within the Tower</l>
     <l n="7">Received his vassal barons ; in that Tower</l>
     <l n="8">Which oft since then has echoed to night-shrieks</l>
     <l n="9">Of secret murder , or the lone lament . 46</l>
     <l n="10">Now other sounds were heard , for on this night</l>
     <l n="11">Its canopied and vaulted chambers rang</l>
     <l n="12">With minstrelsy ; whilst sounds of long acclaim</l>
     <l n="13">Re-echoed , from the loopholes , o'er the Thames 50</l>
     <l n="14">The drawbridge , and the ponderous cullis-gate ,</l>
     <l n="15">Frowned on the moat ; the flanking towers aspired</l>
     <l n="16">O'er the embattled walls , where proudly waved</l>
     <l n="17">The Norman banner . William , laugh to scorn</l>
     <l n="18">The murmurs of conspiracy and hate</l>
     <l n="19">That round thee gather , like the storms of night</l>
     <l n="20">Mustering , when murder hides her visored mien !</l>
     <l n="21">Now , what hast thou to fear ! Let the fierce Dane</l>
     <l n="22">Into the centre of thy kingdom sweep ,</l>
     <l n="23">With hostile armament , even like the tide 60</l>
     <l n="24">Of the hoarse Humber , on whose waves he rode !</l>
     <l n="25">Let foes confederate ; let one voice of hate ,</l>
     <l n="26">One cry of instant vengeance , one deep curse</l>
     <l n="27">Be heard , from Waltham woods to Holderness !</l>
     <l n="28">Let Waltheof , stern in steel ; let Hereward ,</l>
     <l n="29">Impatient as undaunted , flash their swords ;</l>
     <l n="30">Let the boy Edgar , backed by Scotland 's king ,</l>
     <l n="31">Advance his feeble claim , and don his casque ,</l>
     <l n="32">Whose brows might better a blue bonnet grace ;</l>
     <l n="33">Let Edwin and vindictive Morcar join 70</l>
     <l n="34">The sons of Harold ,— what hast thou to fear ?</l>
     <l n="35">London 's sole Tower might laugh their strength to scorn !</l>
     <l n="36">Upon that night when York 's proud castle fell ,</l>
     <l n="37">Here William held his court . The torches glared</l>
     <l n="38">On crest and crozier . Knights and prelates bowed</l>
     <l n="39">Before their sovereign . He , his knights and peers</l>
     <l n="40">Surveying with a stern complacency ,</l>
     <l n="41">Inclined not from his seat , o'ercanopied</l>
     <l n="42">With golden valance , woven by no hand ,</l>
     <l n="43">Save of the Queen . Yet calm his countenance 80</l>
     <l n="44">Shone , and his brow a dignified repose</l>
     <l n="45">Marked kingly ; high his forehead , and besprent</l>
     <l n="46">With dark hair , interspersed with gray ; his eye</l>
     <l n="47">Glanced amiable , chiefly when the light</l>
     <l n="48">Of a brief smile attempered majesty .</l>
     <l n="49">His beard was dark and heavy , yet diffused ,</l>
     <l n="50">Low as the lion ramping on his breast</l>
     <l n="51">Engrailed upon the mail .</l>
     <l n="52">Odo approached ,</l>
     <l n="53">And knelt , then rising , placed the diadem 90</l>
     <l n="54">Upon his brow , with laurels intertwined .</l>
     <l n="55">Again the voice of acclamation rang ,</l>
     <l n="56">And from the galleries a hundred harps</l>
     <l n="57">Resounded Roland 's song ! Long live the King !</l>
     <l n="58">The barons , and the prelates , and the knights ,</l>
     <l n="59">Long live the Conqueror ! cried ; a god on earth !</l>
     <l n="60">That instant the high vaulted chamber shook</l>
     <l n="61">As with a blast from heaven , and all was mute</l>
     <l n="62">Around him , and the very fortress rocked ,</l>
     <l n="63">As it would topple on their heads . He rose 100</l>
     <l n="64">Disturbed and frowning , for tumultuous thoughts</l>
     <l n="65">Crowded like night upon his heart ; then waved</l>
     <l n="66">His hand . The barons , abbots , knights retire .</l>
     <l n="67">Behold him now alone ! before a lamp</l>
     <l n="68">A crucifix appears ; upon the ground</l>
     <l n="69">Lies the same sword that Hastings ’ battle dyed</l>
     <l n="70">Deep to the hilt in gore ; behold , he kneels</l>
     <l n="71">And prays , Thou only , Lord , art ever great ;</l>
     <l n="72">Have mercy on my sins ! The crucifix</l>
     <l n="73">Shook as he spoke , shook visibly , and , hark ! 110</l>
     <l n="74">There is a low moan , as of dying men ,</l>
     <l n="75">At distance heard .</l>
     <l n="76">Then William first knew fear . 113</l>
     <l n="77">He had heard tumults of the battle-field ,</l>
     <l n="78">The noise , the glorious hurrahs , and the clang</l>
     <l n="79">Of trumpets round him , but no sound like this</l>
     <l n="80">Ere smote with unknown terror on his heart ,</l>
     <l n="81">As if the eye of God that moment turned</l>
     <l n="82">And saw it beating .</l>
     <l n="83">Rising slow , he flung 120</l>
     <l n="84">Upon a couch his agitated limbs ;</l>
     <l n="85">The lamp was near him ; on the ground his sword</l>
     <l n="86">And helmet lay ; short troubled slumbers stole ,</l>
     <l n="87">And darkly rose the spirit of his dream .</l>
     <l n="88">He saw a field of blood ,— it passed away ;</l>
     <l n="89">A glittering palace rose , with mailed men</l>
     <l n="90">Thronged , and the voice of multitudes was heard</l>
     <l n="91">Acclaiming : suddenly the sounds had ceased ,</l>
     <l n="92">The glittering palace vanished , and , behold !</l>
     <l n="93">Long winding cloisters , echoing to the chant 130</l>
     <l n="94">Of stoled fathers ; and the mass-song ceased —</l>
     <l n="95">Then a dark tomb appeared , and , lo ! a shape</l>
     <l n="96">As of a phantom-king !</l>
     <l n="97">Nearer it came ,</l>
     <l n="98">And nearer yet , in silence , through the gloom .</l>
     <l n="99">Advancing — still advancing : the cold glare</l>
     <l n="100">Of armour shone as it approached , and now</l>
     <l n="101">It stands o'er William 's couch ! The spectre gazed</l>
     <l n="102">A while , then lifting its dark visor up —</l>
     <l n="103">Horrible vision !— shewed a grisly wound 140</l>
     <l n="104">Deep in its forehead , and therein appeared</l>
     <l n="105">Gouts , as yet dropping from an arrow 's point</l>
     <l n="106">Infixed ! And that red arrow 's deadly barb</l>
     <l n="107">The shadow drew , and pointed at the breast</l>
     <l n="108">Of William ; and the blood dropped on his breast ;</l>
     <l n="109">And through his steely arms one drop of blood 146</l>
     <l n="110">Came cold as death 's own hand upon his heart !</l>
     <l n="111">Whilst a deep voice was heard , Now sleep in peace ,</l>
     <l n="112">I am avenged !</l>
     <l n="113">Starting , he exclaimed , 150</l>
     <l n="114">Hence , horrid phantom ! Ho ! Fitzalain , ho !</l>
     <l n="115">Montgomerie ! Each baron , with a torch ,</l>
     <l n="116">Before him stood . By dawn of day , he cried ,</l>
     <l n="117">We will to horse . What passes in our thoughts</l>
     <l n="118">We shall unfold hereafter . By St Anne ,</l>
     <l n="119">Albeit , not ten thousand phantoms sent</l>
     <l n="120">By the dead Harold can divert our course ,</l>
     <l n="121">They may bear timely warning .</l>
     <l n="122">‘ Tis yet night —</l>
     <l n="123">Give me a battle-song ere daylight dawns ; 160</l>
     <l n="124">The song of Roland , or of Charlemagne —</l>
     <l n="125">Or our own fight at Hastings .</l>
     <l n="126">Torches ! ho !</l>
     <l n="127">And let the gallery blaze with lights ! Awake ,</l>
     <l n="128">Harpers of Normandy , awake ! By Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="129">I will not sleep till your full chords ring out</l>
     <l n="130">The song of England 's conquest ! Torches ! ho !</l>
     <l n="131">He spoke . Again the blazing gallery</l>
     <l n="132">Echoed the harpers ’ song . Old Eustace led</l>
     <l n="133">The choir , and whilst the king paced to and fro , 170</l>
     <l n="134">Thus rose the bold , exulting symphony .</l>

    <head>SONG OF THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Norman armament beneath thy rocks , St Valerie ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is moored ; and , streaming to the morn , three hundred banners fly ,</l>
     <l n="3">Of crimson silk ; with golden cross , effulgent o'er the rest ,</l>
     <l n="4">That banner , proudest in the fleet , streams , which the Lord had blessed .</l>
     <l n="5">The gale is fair , the sails are set , cheerily the south wind blows ,</l>
     <l n="6">And Norman archers , all in steel , have grasped their good yew-bows ;</l>
     <l n="7">Aloud the harpers strike their harps , whilst morning light is flung</l>
     <l n="8">Upon the cross-bows and the shields , that round the masts are hung .</l>
     <l n="9">Speed on , ye brave ! ‘ tis William leads ; bold barons , at his word ,</l>
     <l n="10">Lo ! sixty thousand men of might for William draw the sword .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">So , bound to England 's southern shore , we rolled upon the seas ,</l>
     <l n="12">And gallantly the white sails set were , and swelling to the breeze .</l>
     <l n="13">On , on , to victory or death ! now rose the general cry ;</l>
     <l n="14">The minstrels sang , On , on , ye brave , to death or victory !</l>
     <l n="15">Mark yonder ship , how straight she steers ; ye knights and barons brave ,</l>
     <l n="16">‘ Tis William 's ship , and proud she rides , the foremost o'er the wave .</l>
     <l n="17">And now we hailed the English coast , and , lo ! on Beachy Head ,</l>
     <l n="18">The radiance of the setting sun majestical is shed .</l>
     <l n="19">The fleet sailed on , till , Pevensey ! we saw thy welcome strand ;</l>
     <l n="20">Duke William now his anchor casts , and dauntless leaps to land .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">The English host , by Harold led , at length appear in sight ,</l>
     <l n="22">And now they raise a deafening shout , and stand prepared for fight ;</l>
     <l n="23">The hostile legions halt a while , and their long lines display ,</l>
     <l n="24">Now front to front they stand , in still and terrible array .</l>
     <l n="25">Give out the word , God , and our right ! rush like a storm along ,</l>
     <l n="26">Lift up God 's banner , and advance , resounding Roland 's song !</l>
     <l n="27">Ye spearmen , poise your lances well , by brave Montgomerie led ,</l>
     <l n="28">Ye archers , bend your bows , and draw your arrows to the head .</l>
     <l n="29">They draw — the bent bows ring — huzzah ! another flight , and hark !</l>
     <l n="30">How the sharp arrowy shower beneath the sun goes hissing dark .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">Hark ! louder grows the deadly strife , till all the battle-plain</l>
     <l n="32">Is red with blood , and heaped around with men and horses slain .</l>
     <l n="33">On , Normans , on ! Duke William cried , and Harold , tremble thou ,</l>
     <l n="34">Now think upon thy perjury , and of thy broken vow .</l>
     <l n="35">The banner<span corresp="#note100" type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>of thy armed knight , thy shield , thy helm are vain —</l>
     <l n="36">The fatal shaft has sped ,— by Heaven ! it hisses in his brain !</l>
     <l n="37">So William won the English crown , and all his foemen beat ,</l>
     <l n="38">And Harold , and his Britons brave , lay silent at his feet .</l>
     <l n="39">Enough ! the day is breaking , cried the King :</l>
     <l n="40">Away ! away ! be armed at my side ,</l>
     <l n="41">Without attendants , and to horse , to horse !</l>

     <l n="71">Among the branches . List ! there is no sound 80</l>
     <l n="72">Of horn far off , or tramp of toiling steed ,</l>
     <l n="73">Or call of some belated forester ;</l>
     <l n="74">No lonely taper lights the waste ; the woods 83</l>

     <l n="91">Far round . Oh ! happy , if beneath the flash 100</l>
     <l n="92">Some castle 's bannered battlements were seen ,</l>

     <l n="97">To songs of Charlemagne !</l>
     <l n="98">Or , happier yet</l>
     <l n="99">If some gray convent 's bell remote proclaimed</l>
     <l n="100">The hour of midnight service , when the chant</l>
     <l n="101">Was up , and the long range of windows shone 110</l>
     <l n="102">Far off on the lone woods ; whilst Charity</l>
     <l n="103">Might bless and welcome , in a night like this ,</l>
     <l n="104">The veriest outcast ! Angel of the storm ,</l>
     <l n="105">Ha ! thy red bolt this instant shivering rives</l>
     <l n="106">That blasted oak !</l>
     <l n="107">The horse starts back , and bounds 116</l>
     <l n="108">From the knight 's grasp . The way is dark and wild ;</l>
     <l n="109">As dark and wild as if the solitude</l>
     <l n="110">Had never heard the sound of human steps .</l>
     <l n="111">Pondering he stood , when , by the lightning 's glance , 120</l>
     <l n="112">The knight now marked a small and craggy path</l>
     <l n="113">Descending through the woody labyrinth .</l>
     <l n="114">He tracked his way slowly from brake to brake ,</l>
     <l n="115">Till now he gained a deep sequestered glen .</l>
     <l n="116">I fear not storms , nor thunders , nor the sword ,</l>
     <l n="117">The knight exclaimed : that eye alone I fear ,</l>
     <l n="118">God 's stern and steadfast eye upon the heart !</l>
     <l n="119">Yet peace is in the grave where Harold sleeps .</l>
     <l n="120">Who speaks of Harold ? cried a woman 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="121">Heard through the deep night of the woods . He spoke , 130</l>
     <l n="122">A stern voice answered , he of Harold spoke ,</l>
     <l n="123">Who feared his sword in the red front of war ,</l>
     <l n="124">Less than the powers of darkness : and he crossed</l>
     <l n="125">His breast , for at that instant rose the thought</l>
     <l n="126">Of the weird sisters of the wold , that mock</l>
     <l n="127">Night wanderers , and “ syllable men 's names ”</l>
     <l n="128">In savage solitude . If now , he cried ,</l>
     <l n="129">Dark minister , thy spells of wizard power</l>
     <l n="130">Have raised the storm and wild winds up , appear !</l>
     <l n="131">He scarce had spoken , when , by the red flash 140</l>
     <l n="132">That glanced along the glen , half visible ,</l>
     <l n="133">Uprose a tall , majestic female form :</l>
     <l n="134">So visible , her eyes ’ intenser light</l>
     <l n="135">Shone wildly through the darkness ; and her face ,</l>
     <l n="136">On which one pale flash more intently shone ,</l>
     <l n="137">Was like a ghost 's by moonlight , as she stood</l>
     <l n="138">A moment seen : her lips appeared to move ,</l>
     <l n="139">Muttering , whilst her long locks of ebon hair</l>
     <l n="140">Streamed o'er her forehead , by the bleak winds blown 149</l>
     <l n="141">Upon her heaving breast .</l>
     <l n="142">The knight advanced ;</l>
     <l n="143">The expiring embers from a cave within ,</l>
     <l n="144">Now wakened by the night-air , shot a light ,</l>
     <l n="145">Fitful and trembling , and this human form ,</l>
     <l n="146">If it were human , at the entrance stood ,</l>
     <l n="147">As seemed , of a rude cave . You might have thought</l>
     <l n="148">She had strange spells , such a mysterious power</l>
     <l n="149">Was round her ; such terrific solitude ,</l>
     <l n="150">Such night , as of the kingdom of the grave ;</l>
     <l n="151">Whilst hurricanes seemed to obey her ‘ hest . 160</l>
     <l n="152">And she no less admired , when , front to front ,</l>
     <l n="153">By the rekindling ember 's darted gleam ,</l>
     <l n="154">A mailed man , of proud illustrious port ,</l>
     <l n="155">She marked ; and thus , but with unfaltering voice ,</l>
     <l n="156">She spake :</l>
     <l n="157">Yes ! it was Harold 's name I heard !</l>
     <l n="158">Whence , and what art thou ? I have watched the night ,</l>
     <l n="159">And listened to the tempest as it howled ;</l>
     <l n="160">And whilst I listening lay , methought I heard ,</l>
     <l n="161">Even now , the tramp as of a rushing steed ; 170</l>
     <l n="162">Therefore I rose , and looked into the dark ,</l>
     <l n="163">And now I hear one speak of Harold : say ,</l>
     <l n="164">Whence , and what art thou , solitary man ?</l>
     <l n="165">If lost and weary , enter this poor shed ;</l>
     <l n="166">If wretched , pray with me ; if on dark deeds</l>
     <l n="167">Intent , I am a most poor woman , cast</l>
     <l n="168">Into the depths of mortal misery !</l>
     <l n="169">The desolate have nought to lose :— pass on !</l>
     <l n="170">I had not spoken , but for Harold 's name ,</l>
     <l n="171">By thee pronounced : it sounded in my ears 180</l>
     <l n="172">As of a better world — ah , no ! of days</l>
     <l n="173">Of happiness in this . Whence , who art thou ?</l>
     <l n="174">I am a Norman , woman ; more to know 183</l>
     <l n="175">Seek not :— and I have been to Harold 's grave ,</l>
     <l n="176">Remembering that the mightiest are but dust ;</l>
     <l n="177">And I have prayed the peace of God might rest</l>
     <l n="178">Upon his soul .</l>
     <l n="179">And , by our blessed Lord ,</l>
     <l n="180">The deed was holy , that lone woman said ;</l>
     <l n="181">And may the benediction of all saints , 190</l>
     <l n="182">Whoe'er thou art , rest on thy head . But say ,</l>
     <l n="183">What perilous mischance hath hither led</l>
     <l n="184">Thy footsteps in an hour and night like this ?</l>
     <l n="185">Over his grave , of whom we spake , I heard</l>
     <l n="186">The mass-song sung . I knelt upon that grave ,</l>
     <l n="187">And prayed for my own sins , I left the fane ,</l>
     <l n="188">And heard the chanted rite at distance die .</l>
     <l n="189">Returning through these forest shades , with thoughts</l>
     <l n="190">Not of this world , I pressed my panting steed ,</l>
     <l n="191">The foremost of the Norman knights , and passed 200</l>
     <l n="192">The track , that , leading to the forest-ford ,</l>
     <l n="193">Winds through the opening thickets ; on a height</l>
     <l n="194">I stood and listened , but no voice replied :</l>
     <l n="195">The storm descended ; at the lightning 's flash</l>
     <l n="196">My good steed burst the reins , and frantic fled .</l>
     <l n="197">I was alone : the small and craggy path</l>
     <l n="198">Led to this solitary glen ; and here ,</l>
     <l n="199">As dark and troubled thoughts arose , I mused</l>
     <l n="200">Upon the dead man 's sleep ; for God , I thought ,</l>
     <l n="201">This night spoke in the rocking of the winds ! 210</l>
     <l n="202">There is a Judge in heaven , the woman said ,</l>
     <l n="203">Who seeth all things ; and there is a voice ,</l>
     <l n="204">Inaudible ‘ midst the tumultuous world ,</l>
     <l n="205">That speaks of fear or comfort to the heart</l>
     <l n="206">When all is still ! But shroud thee in this cave</l>
     <l n="207">Till morning : such a sojourn may not please</l>
     <l n="208">A courtly knight , like echoing halls of joy . 217</l>
     <l n="209">I have but some wild roots , a bed of fern ,</l>
     <l n="210">And no companion save this bloodhound here ,</l>
     <l n="211">Who , at my beck , would tear thee to the earth ;</l>
     <l n="212">Yet enter — fear not ! And that poor abode</l>
     <l n="213">The proud knight entered , with rain-drenched plume .</l>
     <l n="214">Yet here I dwell in peace , the woman said ,</l>
     <l n="215">Remote from towns , nor start at the dire sound</l>
     <l n="216">Of that accursed curfew ! Soldier-knight ,</l>
     <l n="217">Thou art a Norman ! Had the invader spurned</l>
     <l n="218">All charities in thy own native land ,</l>
     <l n="219">Yes , thou wouldst know what injured Britons feel !</l>
     <l n="220">Nay , Englishwoman , thou dost wrong our king ,</l>
     <l n="221">The knight replied : conspiracy and fraud 230</l>
     <l n="222">Hourly surrounding him , at last compelled</l>
     <l n="223">Stern rigour to awake . What ! shall the bird</l>
     <l n="224">Of thunder slumber on the citadel ,</l>
     <l n="225">And blench his eye of fire , when , looking down ,</l>
     <l n="226">He sees , in ceaseless enmity combined ,</l>
     <l n="227">Those who would pluck his feathers from his breast ,</l>
     <l n="228">And cast them to the winds ! Woman , on thee ,</l>
     <l n="229">Haply , the tempest of the times has beat</l>
     <l n="230">Too roughly ; but thy griefs he can requite .</l>
     <l n="231">The indignant woman answered , He requite ! 240</l>
     <l n="232">Can he bring back the dead ? Can he restore</l>
     <l n="233">Joy to the broken-hearted ? He requite !</l>
     <l n="234">Can he pour plenty on the vales his frown</l>
     <l n="235">Has blasted , bid sweet evening hear again</l>
     <l n="236">The village pipe , and the fair flowers revive</l>
     <l n="237">His bloody footstep crushed ? For poverty ,</l>
     <l n="238">I reck it not : what is to me the night ,</l>
     <l n="239">Spent cheerless , and in gloom and solitude ?</l>
     <l n="240">I fix my eye upon that crucifix ,</l>
     <l n="241">I mourn for those that are not — for my brave , 250</l>
     <l n="242">My buried countrymen ! Of this no more ! 251</l>
     <l n="243">Thou art a foe ; but a brave soldier-knight</l>
     <l n="244">Would scorn to wrong a woman ; and if death</l>
     <l n="245">Could arm my hand this moment , thou wert safe</l>
     <l n="246">In a poor cottage as in royal halls .</l>
     <l n="247">Here rest a while till morning dawns — the way</l>
     <l n="248">No mortal could retrace :— ‘ twill not be long ,</l>
     <l n="249">And I can cheat the time with some old strain ;</l>
     <l n="250">For , Norman though thou art , thy soul has felt</l>
     <l n="251">Even as a man , when sacred sympathy 260</l>
     <l n="252">This morning led thee to King Harold 's grave .</l>
     <l n="253">The woman sat beside the hearth , and stirred</l>
     <l n="254">The embers , or with fern or brushwood raised</l>
     <l n="255">A fitful flame , but cautious , lest its light</l>
     <l n="256">Some roving forester might mark . At times ,</l>
     <l n="257">The small and trembling blaze shone on her face ,</l>
     <l n="258">Still beautiful , and showed the dark eye 's fire</l>
     <l n="259">Beneath her long black locks . When she stood up ,</l>
     <l n="260">A dignity , though in the garb of want ,</l>
     <l n="261">Seemed round her , chiefly when the brushwood-blaze 270</l>
     <l n="262">Glanced through the gloom , and touched the dusky mail</l>
     <l n="263">Of the strange knight ; then with sad smile she sung :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="264">Oh ! when ‘ tis summer weather ,</l>

     <l n="307">At once , horns , trumpets , and the shouts of men ,</l>

     <l n="309">The knight , upstarting from his dreamy trance ,</l>
     <l n="310">High raised his vizor , and his bugle rang ,</l>
     <l n="311">Answering . By God in heaven , thou art the king ! 320</l>

     <l n="1">By the rolling of the drums ,</l>
     <l n="2">Hitherward King William comes !</l>
     <l n="3">The night is struggling with the day —</l>
     <l n="4">Hags of darkness , hence ! away !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">William is in the north ; the avenging sword</l>
     <l n="6">Descended like a whirlwind where he passed ;</l>
     <l n="7">Slaughter and Famine at his bidding wait , 30</l>
     <l n="8">Like lank , impatient bloodhounds , till he cries ,</l>
     <l n="9">Pursue ! Again the Norman banner floats</l>
     <l n="10">Triumphant on the citadel of York ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where , circled with the blazonry of arms ,</l>
     <l n="12">Amid his barons , William holds his state .</l>
     <l n="13">The boy preserved from death , young Malet , kneels ,</l>
     <l n="14">With folded hands ; his father , mother kneel ,</l>
     <l n="15">Imploring clemency for Harold 's sons ;</l>
     <l n="16">For Edmund most . Bareheaded Waltheof bends , 39</l>
     <l n="17">And yields the keys ! A breathless courier comes :</l>
     <l n="18">What tidings ? O'er the seas the Danes are fled ;</l>
     <l n="19">Morcar and Edwin in Northumberland ,</l>
     <l n="20">Amidst its wildest mountains , seek to hide</l>
     <l n="21">Their broken hopes — their troops are all dispersed .</l>
     <l n="22">Malcolm alone , and the boy Atheling ,</l>
     <l n="23">And the two sons of the dead Harold , wait</l>
     <l n="24">The winds to bear them to the North away .</l>
     <l n="25">Bid forth a thousand spearmen , William cried :</l>
     <l n="26">Now , by the resurrection , and the throne</l>
     <l n="27">Of God , King Malcolm shall repent the hour 50</l>
     <l n="28">He ere drew sword in England ! Hence ! away !</l>
     <l n="29">The west wind blows , the boat is on the beach ,</l>
     <l n="30">The clansmen all embarked , the pipe is heard ,</l>
     <l n="31">Whilst thoughtful Malcolm and young Atheling</l>
     <l n="32">Linger the last upon the shore ; and there</l>
     <l n="33">Are Harold 's children , the gray-headed monk ,</l>
     <l n="34">Godwin , and Edmund , and poor Adela .</l>
     <l n="35">Then Malcolm spoke : The lot is cast ! oh , fly</l>
     <l n="36">From this devoted land , and live with us ,</l>
     <l n="37">Amidst our lakes and mountains ! Adela , 60</l>
     <l n="38">Atheling whispered , does thy heart say Yes ?</l>
     <l n="39">For in this world we ne'er may meet again .</l>
     <l n="40">The brief hour calls — come , Adela , exclaimed</l>
     <l n="41">Malcolm , and kindly took her hand . She looked</l>
     <l n="42">To heaven , and fell upon her knees , then rose ,</l>
     <l n="43">And answered :</l>
     <l n="44">Sire , when my brave father fell ,</l>
     <l n="45">We three were exiles on a distant shore ;</l>
     <l n="46">And never , or in solitude or courts ,</l>
     <l n="47">Was God forgotten — all is in his hand . 70</l>
     <l n="48">When those whom I had loved from infancy</l>
     <l n="49">Here joined the din of arms , I came with them ;</l>
     <l n="50">With them I have partaken good and ill , 73</l>
     <l n="51">Have in the self-same mother 's lap been laid ,</l>
     <l n="52">The same eye gazed on us with tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="53">And the same mother prayed prosperity</l>
     <l n="54">Might still be ours through life ! Alas ! our lot</l>
     <l n="55">How different !</l>
     <l n="56">Yet let them go with you ,</l>
     <l n="57">I argue not — the first time in our lives , 80</l>
     <l n="58">If it be so , we here shall separate ;</l>
     <l n="59">Whatever fate betide , I will not go</l>
     <l n="60">Till I have knelt upon my father 's grave !</l>
     <l n="61">‘ Tis perilous to think , Atheling cried ,</l>
     <l n="62">Most perilous — how ‘ scape the Norman 's eye ?</l>
     <l n="63">She turned , and with a solemn calmness said :</l>
     <l n="64">If we should perish , at the hour of death</l>
     <l n="65">My father will look down from heaven , and say ,</l>
     <l n="66">Come , my poor child ! oh , come where I am blessed !</l>
     <l n="67">My brothers , seek your safety . Here I stand 90</l>
     <l n="68">Resolved ; and never will I leave these shores</l>
     <l n="69">Till I have knelt upon my father 's grave !</l>
     <l n="70">We never will forsake thee ! Godwin cried .</l>
     <l n="71">Let death betide , said Edmund , we will go ,</l>
     <l n="72">Yes ! go with thee , or perish !</l>
     <l n="73">As he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="74">The pilot gave the signal . Then farewell !</l>
     <l n="75">King Malcolm cried , friends lately met , and now</l>
     <l n="76">To part for ever ! and he kissed the cheek</l>
     <l n="77">Of Adela , and took brave Godwin 's hand 100</l>
     <l n="78">And Edmund 's , and then said , almost in tears ,</l>
     <l n="79">It is not now too late ! yet o'er my grave</l>
     <l n="80">So might a duteous daughter weep ! God speed</l>
     <l n="81">Brave Malcolm to his father 's land ! they cried .</l>
     <l n="82">The ships beyond the promontory 's point</l>
     <l n="83">Were anchored , and the tide was ebbing fast .</l>
     <l n="84">Then Ailric : Sire , not unforeseen by me 107</l>
     <l n="85">Was this sad day . Oh ! King of Scotland , hear !</l>
     <l n="86">I was a brother of that holy house</l>
     <l n="87">Where Harold 's bones are buried ; from my vows</l>
     <l n="88">I was absolved , and followed — for I loved</l>
     <l n="89">His children — followed them through every fate .</l>
     <l n="90">My few gray hairs will soon descend in peace ,</l>
     <l n="91">When I shall be forgotten ; but till then ,</l>
     <l n="92">My services , my last poor services ,</l>
     <l n="93">To them I have devoted , for the sake</l>
     <l n="94">Of him , their father , and my king , to whom</l>
     <l n="95">All in this world I owed ! Protect them , Lord ,</l>
     <l n="96">And bless them , when the turf is on my head ;</l>
     <l n="97">And , in their old age , may they sometimes think 120</l>
     <l n="98">Of Ailric , cold and shrouded in his grave ,</l>
     <l n="99">When summer smiles ! Sire , listen whilst I pray</l>
     <l n="100">One boon of thy compassion : not for me —</l>
     <l n="101">I reck not whether vengeance wake or sleep —</l>
     <l n="102">But for the safety of this innocent maid</l>
     <l n="103">I speak . South of the Humber , in a cave ,</l>
     <l n="104">Concealed amidst the rocks and tangled brakes ,</l>
     <l n="105">I have deposited some needful weeds</l>
     <l n="106">For this sad hour ; for well , indeed , I knew ,</l>
     <l n="107">If all should fail , this maiden 's last resolve , 130</l>
     <l n="108">To kneel upon her father 's grave , or die .</l>
     <l n="109">For this I have provided ; but the time</l>
     <l n="110">Is precious , and the sun is westering slow ;</l>
     <l n="111">The fierce eye of the lion may be turned</l>
     <l n="112">Upon this spot to-morrow ! Adela ,</l>
     <l n="113">Now hear your friend , your father ! The fleet hour</l>
     <l n="114">Is passing , never to return : oh , seize</l>
     <l n="115">The instant ! Thou , King Malcolm , grant my prayer !</l>
     <l n="116">If we embark , and leave the shores this night ,</l>
     <l n="117">The voice of fame will bruit it far and wide , 140</l>
     <l n="118">That Harold 's children fled with thee , and sought 141</l>
     <l n="119">A refuge in thy kingdom . None will know</l>
     <l n="120">Our destination . In thy boat conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="121">We may be landed near the rocky cave ;</l>
     <l n="122">The boat again ply to thy ships , and they</l>
     <l n="123">Plough homeward the north seas , whilst we are left</l>
     <l n="124">To fate . Again the pilot 's voice was heard ;</l>
     <l n="125">And , o'er the sand-hills , an approaching file</l>
     <l n="126">Of Norman soldiers , with projected spears ,</l>
     <l n="127">Already seemed as rushing on their prey . 150</l>
     <l n="128">Then Ailric took the hand of Adela ;</l>
     <l n="129">She and her brothers , and young Atheling ,</l>
     <l n="130">And Scotland 's king , are in one boat embarked .</l>
     <l n="131">Meantime the sun sets red , and twilight shades</l>
     <l n="132">The sinking hills . The solitary boat</l>
     <l n="133">Has reached the adverse shore .</l>
     <l n="134">Here , then , we part !</l>
     <l n="135">King Malcolm said ; and every voice replied ,</l>
     <l n="136">God speed brave Malcolm to his father 's land !</l>
     <l n="137">Ailric , the brothers , and their sister , left 160</l>
     <l n="138">The boat ; they stood upon the moonlit beach ,</l>
     <l n="139">Still listening to the sounds , as they grew faint ,</l>
     <l n="140">Of the receding oars , and watching still</l>
     <l n="141">If one white streak at distance , as they dipped ,</l>
     <l n="142">Were seen , till all was solitude around .</l>
     <l n="143">Pensive , they sought a refuge for that night</l>
     <l n="144">In the bleak ocean-cave . The morning dawns ;</l>
     <l n="145">The brothers have put off the plumes of war ,</l>
     <l n="146">Dropping one tear upon the sword . Disguised</l>
     <l n="147">In garb to suit their fortunes , they appear 170</l>
     <l n="148">Like shipwrecked seamen of Armorica ,</l>
     <l n="149">By a Franciscan hermit through the land</l>
     <l n="150">Led to St Alban 's shrine , to offer vows ,</l>
     <l n="151">Vows to the God who heard them in that hour</l>
     <l n="152">When all beside had perished in the storm . 175</l>
     <l n="153">Wrecked near his ocean-cave , an eremite</l>
     <l n="154">( So went the tale of their disastrous fate )</l>
     <l n="155">Sustained them , and now guides them through a land</l>
     <l n="156">Of strangers . That fair boy was wont to sing</l>
     <l n="157">Upon the mast , when the still ship went slow 180</l>
     <l n="158">Along the seas , in sunshine ; and that garb</l>
     <l n="159">Conceals the lovely , light-haired Adela .</l>
     <l n="160">The cuckoo 's note in the deep woods was heard</l>
     <l n="161">When forth , they fared . At many a convent gate</l>
     <l n="162">They stood and prayed for shelter , and their pace</l>
     <l n="163">Hastened , if , high amid the clouds , they marked</l>
     <l n="164">Some solitary castle lift its brow</l>
     <l n="165">Gray in the distance — hastened , so to reach ,</l>
     <l n="166">Ere it grew dark , its hospitable towers .</l>
     <l n="167">There the lithe minstrel sung his roundelay : 190</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="168">Listen , lords and ladies bright !</l>

     <l n="171">Of Bevis , or of Iscapar .</l>
     <l n="172">I have tales of wandering maids ,</l>
     <l n="173">And fairy elves in haunted glades ,</l>
     <l n="174">Of phantom-troops that silent ride</l>
     <l n="175">By the moonlit forest 's side .</l>
     <l n="176">I have songs ( fair maidens , hear ! )</l>
     <l n="177">To warn the lovelorn lady 's ear . 200</l>

     <l n="180">When tired , at noon , by the white waterfall ,</l>
     <l n="181">In some romantic and secluded glen ,</l>
     <l n="182">They sat , and heard the blackbird overhead</l>
     <l n="183">Singing , unseen , a song , such as they heard</l>
     <l n="184">In infancy .<span corresp="#note105" type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span>So every vernal morn 207</l>
     <l n="185">Brought with it scents of flowers , or songs of birds ,</l>
     <l n="186">Mingled with many shapings of old things ,</l>
     <l n="187">And days gone by . Then up again , to scale</l>
     <l n="188">The airy mountain , and behold the plain</l>
     <l n="189">Stretching below , and fading far away ,</l>
     <l n="190">How beautiful ; yet still to feel a tear</l>
     <l n="191">Starting , even when it shone most beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="192">To think , Here , in the country of our birth ,</l>
     <l n="193">No rest is ours !</l>
     <l n="194">On , to our father 's grave !</l>
     <l n="195">So southward through the country they had passed</l>
     <l n="196">Now many days , and casual shelter found</l>
     <l n="197">In villages , or hermit 's lonely cave , 220</l>
     <l n="198">Or castle , high embattled on the point</l>
     <l n="199">Of some steep mountain , or in convent walls ;</l>
     <l n="200">For most with pity heard his song , and marked</l>

     <l n="202">Or when the pale monk , with his folded hands</l>
     <l n="203">Upon his breast , prayed , For the love of God ,</l>
     <l n="204">Pity the poor , give alms ; and bade them speed !</l>
     <l n="205">And now , in distant light , the pinnacles</l>
     <l n="206">Of a gray fane appeared , whilst on the woods</l>
     <l n="207">Still evening shed its parting light . Oh , say , 230</l>
     <l n="208">Say , villager , what towers are those that rise</l>
     <l n="209">Eastward beyond the alders ?</l>
     <l n="210">Know ye not ,</l>
     <l n="211">He answered , Waltham Abbey ? Harold there</l>
     <l n="212">Is buried — he who in the fight was slain</l>
     <l n="213">At Hastings ! To the cheek of Adela</l>
     <l n="214">A deadly paleness came . On — let us on !</l>
     <l n="215">Faintly she cried , and held her brother 's arm ,</l>
     <l n="216">And hid her face a moment with her hand .</l>
     <l n="217">And now the massy portal 's sculptured arch 240</l>
     <l n="218">Before them rose .</l>
     <l n="219">Say , porter , Ailric cried ,</l>
     <l n="220">Poor mariners , wrecked on the northern shores ,</l>
     <l n="221">Ask charity . Does aged Osgood live ?</l>
     <l n="222">Tell him a poor Franciscan , wandering far ,</l>
     <l n="223">And wearied , for the love of God would ask</l>
     <l n="224">His charity .</l>
     <l n="225">Osgood came slowly forth ;</l>
     <l n="226">The light that touched the western turret fell</l>
     <l n="227">On his pale face . The pilgrim-father said : 250</l>
     <l n="228">I am your brother Ailric — look on me !</l>
     <l n="229">And these are Harold 's children !</l>
     <l n="230">Whilst he spoke ,</l>
     <l n="231">Godwin , advancing , with emotion cried ,</l>
     <l n="232">We are his children ! I am Godwin , this</l>
     <l n="233">Is Edmund , and , lo ! poor and in disguise ,</l>
     <l n="234">Our sister ! We would kneel upon his grave —</l>
     <l n="235">Our father 's !</l>
     <l n="236">Come yet nearer , Osgood said ,</l>
     <l n="237">Yet nearer ! and that instant Adela 260</l>
     <l n="238">Looked up , and wiping from her eyes a tear ,</l>
     <l n="239">Have you forgotten Adela ?</l>
     <l n="240">O God !</l>
     <l n="241">The old man trembling cried , ye are indeed</l>
     <l n="242">Our benefactor 's children ! Adela ,</l>
     <l n="243">Edmund , brave Godwin ! welcome to these walls —</l>
     <l n="244">Welcome , my old companion ! and he fell</l>
     <l n="245">Upon the neck of Ailric , and both wept .</l>
     <l n="246">Then Osgood : Children of that honoured lord</l>
     <l n="247">Who gave us all , go near and bless his grave . 270</l>
     <l n="248">One parting sunbeam yet upon the floor</l>
     <l n="249">Rested — it passed away , and darker gloom</l>
     <l n="250">Was gathering in the aisles . Each footstep 's sound</l>
     <l n="251">Was more distinctly heard , for all beside 274</l>
     <l n="252">Was silent . Slow along the glimmering fane</l>
     <l n="253">They passed , like shadows risen from the tombs .</l>
     <l n="254">The entrance-door was closed , lest aught intrude</l>
     <l n="255">Upon the sanctity of this sad hour .</l>
     <l n="256">The inner choir they enter , part in shade</l>
     <l n="257">And part in light , for now the rising moon 280</l>
     <l n="258">Began to glance upon the shrines , and tombs ,</l>
     <l n="259">And pillars . Trembling through the windows high ,</l>
     <l n="260">One beam , a moment , on that cold gray stone</l>
     <l n="261">Is flung — the word “ Infelix "[ 106 ] is scarce seen .</l>
     <l n="262">Behold his gravestone ! Osgood said . Each eye</l>
     <l n="263">Was turned . A while intent they gazed , then knelt</l>
     <l n="264">Before the altar , on the marble stone !</l>
     <l n="265">No sound was heard through all the dim expanse</l>
     <l n="266">Of the vast building , none but of the air</l>
     <l n="267">That came in dying echoes up the aisle , 290</l>
     <l n="268">Like whispers heard at the confessional .</l>
     <l n="269">Thus Harold 's children , hand in hand , knelt down —</l>
     <l n="270">Upon their father 's grave knelt down , and prayed :</l>
     <l n="271">Have mercy on his soul — have mercy , Lord !</l>
     <l n="272">They knelt a lengthened space , and bowed their heads ,</l>
     <l n="273">Some natural tears they shed , and crossed their breasts ;</l>
     <l n="274">Then rising slowly up , looked round , and saw</l>
     <l n="275">A monk approaching near , unmarked before ;</l>
     <l n="276">And in the further distance the tall form</l>
     <l n="277">As of a female . He who wore the hood 300</l>
     <l n="278">And habit of a monk approached and spoke :</l>
     <l n="279">Brothers ! beloved sister ! know ye not</l>
     <l n="280">These features ?— and he raised his hood — Behold</l>
     <l n="281">Me — me , your brother Marcus ! whom these weeds ,</l>
     <l n="282">Since last we met , have hidden from the world :</l>
     <l n="283">Let me kneel with you here !</l>
     <l n="284">When Adela 407</l>
     <l n="285">Beheld him , she exclaimed , Oh ! do we meet</l>
     <l n="286">Here , my lost brother , o'er a father 's grave ?</l>
     <l n="287">You live , restored a moment in this world ,</l>
     <l n="288">To us as from the grave ! And Godwin took</l>
     <l n="289">His hand , and said , My brother , tell us all ;</l>
     <l n="290">How have you lived unknown ? Oh ! tell us all !</l>
     <l n="291">When in that grave our father , he replied ,</l>
     <l n="292">Was laid , ye fled , and I in this sad land</l>
     <l n="293">Remained to cope with fortune . To these walls</l>
     <l n="294">I came , when Ailric , from his vows absolved ,</l>
     <l n="295">With you was wandering . None my lineage knew ,</l>
     <l n="296">Or name , but I some time had won regard</l>
     <l n="297">From the superior . Osgood knew me not , 420</l>
     <l n="298">For with Earl Edwin I had lived from youth .</l>
     <l n="299">To our superior thus I knelt and prayed :</l>
     <l n="300">Sir , I beseech you , for the love of God ,</l>
     <l n="301">And of our Lady Mary , and St John ,</l>
     <l n="302">You would receive me here to live and die</l>
     <l n="303">Among you . What most moved my heart to take</l>
     <l n="304">The vows was this , that here , from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="305">From year to year , within the walls he raised ,</l>
     <l n="306">I might behold my father 's grave . This eve</l>
     <l n="307">I sat in the confessional , unseen , 430</l>
     <l n="308">When you approached . I scarce restrained the tear ,</l>
     <l n="309">From many recollections , when I heard</l>
     <l n="310">A tale of sorrow and of sin . Come near ,</l>
     <l n="311">Woman of woe !— and a wan woman stood</l>
     <l n="312">Before them , tall and stately ; her dark eyes</l>
     <l n="313">Shone , as the uncertain lamp cast a brief glare ,</l>
     <l n="314">And showed her neck , and raven hair , and lips</l>
     <l n="315">Moving . She spoke not , but advanced and knelt —</l>
     <l n="316">She , too — on Harold 's grave ; then prayed aloud ,</l>
     <l n="317">O God , be merciful to him — and me ! 440</l>
     <l n="318">Who art thou ? Godwin cried .</l>
     <l n="319">Ah ! know ye not</l>
     <l n="320">The wretched Editha ? No children 's love</l>
     <l n="321">Could equal mine ! I trod among the dead —</l>
     <l n="322">Did I not , fathers ?— trod among the dead</l>
     <l n="323">From corse to corse , or saw men 's dying eyes</l>
     <l n="324">Fixed upon mine , and heard such groans as yet</l>
     <l n="325">Rive , with remembrance , my torn heart : I found</l>
     <l n="326">Him who rests here , where then he lay in blood !</l>
     <l n="327">When he was buried , I beheld the rites 450</l>
     <l n="328">At distance , and with broken heart retired</l>
     <l n="329">To the wild woods ; there I have lived unseen</l>
     <l n="330">From that sad hour . Late when the tempest rocked ,</l>
     <l n="331">At midnight , a proud soldier shelter sought</l>
     <l n="332">In my lone cell ; ‘ twas when the storm was heard</l>
     <l n="333">Through the deep forest , and he too had knelt</l>
     <l n="334">At Harold 's grave ! Who was it ? He ! the king !</l>
     <l n="335">Say , fathers , was it not the hand of God</l>
     <l n="336">That led his footsteps there !— but has he learned</l>
     <l n="337">Humility ? Oh ! ask this bleeding land ! 460</l>
     <l n="338">Last night a phantom came to me in dreams ,</l>
     <l n="339">And a voice said , Come , visit my cold grave !</l>
     <l n="340">I came , by some mysterious impulse led ;</l>
     <l n="341">I heard the even song , and when the sound</l>
     <l n="342">Had ceased , and all departed , save one monk ,</l>
     <l n="343">Who stood and gazed upon this grave alone ,</l>
     <l n="344">I prayed that he would hear me , at this hour ,</l>
     <l n="345">Confess my secret sins , for my full heart</l>
     <l n="346">Was labouring . It was Harold 's son who sat</l>
     <l n="347">In the confessional , to me unknown ; 470</l>
     <l n="348">But all is now revealed — and lo ! I stand</l>
     <l n="349">Before you !</l>
     <l n="350">As she spoke , a thrilling awe 473</l>
     <l n="351">Came to each heart : loftier she seemed to stand</l>
     <l n="352">In the dim moonlight ; sorrowful , yet stern ,</l>
     <l n="353">Her aspect ; and her breast was seen to beat ;</l>
     <l n="354">Her eyes were fixed , and shone with fearful light .</l>
     <l n="355">She raised her right hand , and her dark hair fell</l>
     <l n="356">Upon her neck , whilst all , scarce breathing , heard :</l>
     <l n="357">My spirit labours ! she exclaimed . This night ! 480</l>
     <l n="358">The tomb ! the altar ! Ha ! the vision strains</l>
     <l n="359">My senses to oppression ! Marked ye not</l>
     <l n="360">The trodden throne restored — the Saxon line<span corresp="#note107" type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span></l>
     <l n="361">Of England 's monarchs bursting through the gloom ?</l>
     <l n="362">Lady , I look on thee ! In distant years ,</l>
     <l n="363">Even from the Northern throne which thou shalt share ,<span corresp="#note108" type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span></l>
     <l n="364">A warrior-monarch shall arise , whose arm ,</l>
     <l n="365">In concert with this country , now bowed low ,</l>
     <l n="366">Shall tear the eagle from a conqueror 's grasp ,</l>
     <l n="367">Far greater than this Norman ! 490</l>
     <l n="368">Spare , O God !</l>
     <l n="369">My burning brain ! Then , with a shriek , she fell ,</l>
     <l n="370">Insensible , upon the Saxon 's grave !</l>
     <l n="371">They bore her from the fane ; and Godwin said ,</l>
     <l n="372">Peace , peace be with her , now and evermore !</l>
     <l n="373">He , taking Marcus by the hand , Yet here</l>
     <l n="374">Thou shalt behold , behold from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="375">This honoured grave ! But where in the great world</l>
     <l n="376">Shall be thy place of rest , poor Adela ?</l>
     <l n="377">O God , be ever with her ! Marcus cried , 500</l>
     <l n="378">With her , and you , my brothers ! Here we part ,</l>
     <l n="379">Never to meet again . Whate'er your fate ,</l>
     <l n="380">I shall remember with a brother 's love ,</l>
     <l n="381">And pray for you ; but all my spirit rests 504</l>
     <l n="382">In other worlds — in worlds , oh ! not like this !</l>
     <l n="383">Ye may return to this sad scene when I</l>
     <l n="384">Am dust and ashes ; ye may yet return ,</l>
     <l n="385">And visit this sad spot ; perhaps when age</l>
     <l n="386">Or grief has brought such change of heart as now</l>
     <l n="387">I feel , then shall you look upon my grave , 510</l>
     <l n="388">And shed one tear for him whose latest prayer</l>
     <l n="389">Will be : Oh , bless you ! bless my sister , Lord !</l>
     <l n="390">Then Adela , with lifted look composed :</l>
     <l n="391">Father , it is performed ,— the duty vowed</l>
     <l n="392">When we returned to this devoted land ,</l>
     <l n="393">The last sad duty of a daughter 's love !</l>
     <l n="394">And now I go in peace — go to a world</l>
     <l n="395">Of sorrow , conscious that a father 's voice</l>
     <l n="396">Speaks to my soul , and that thine eye , O God !</l>
     <l n="397">Whate'er the fortunes of our future days , 520</l>
     <l n="398">Is o'er us . Thou , direct our onward road !</l>
     <l n="399">O'er the last Saxon 's grave , old Osgood raised</l>
     <l n="400">His hands and prayed :</l>
     <l n="401">Father of heaven and earth ,</l>
     <l n="402">All is beneath Thine eye ! ‘ Tis ours to bend</l>
     <l n="403">In silence . Children of misfortune , loved ,</l>
     <l n="404">Revered — children of him who raised these roofs ,</l>
     <l n="405">No home is found for you in this sad land ;</l>
     <l n="406">And none , perhaps , may know the spot , or shed</l>
     <l n="407">A tear upon the earth where ye are laid ! 530</l>
     <l n="408">So saying , on their heads he placed his hands ,</l>
     <l n="409">And blessed them all ; but , after pause , rejoined :</l>
     <l n="410">‘ Tis dangerous lingering here — the fire-eyed lynx</l>
     <l n="411">Would lap your blood ! Westward , beyond the Lea ,</l>
     <l n="412">There is a cell where ye may rest to-night .</l>
     <l n="413">The portal opened ; on the battlements</l>
     <l n="414">The moonlight shone , silent and beautiful !</l>
     <l n="415">Before them lay their path through the wide world — 538</l>
     <l n="416">The nightingales were singing as they passed ;</l>
     <l n="417">And , looking back upon the glimmering towers ,</l>
     <l n="418">They , led by Ailric , and with thoughts on heaven ,</l>
     <l n="419">Through the lone forest held their pensive way .</l>

     <l n="1">William , on his imperial throne , at York</l>

     <l n="6">Yet labours , like the ocean after storm .</l>

   <p>ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SPEED .</p>
   <p>“ This victory thus obtained , Duke William wholly ascribed unto God , and by way of a solemne supplication or procession , gave him the thankes ; and pitching for that night his pavilion among the bodies of the dead , the next day returned to Hastings , there to consult upon his great and most prosperously begun enterprise , giving first commandement for the buriall of his slain souldiers .</p>
   <p>“ But Morcar and Edwin , the unfortunate Queenes ’ brethren , by night escaping the battaile , came unto London , where , with the rest of the peeres , they beganne to lay the foundation of some fresh hopes ; posting thence their messengers to raise a new supply , and to comfort the English ( who , through all the land , were stricken into a feareful astonishment with this unexpected newes ) from a despairing feare , showing the chance of warre to be mutable , their number many and captaines sufficient to try another field . Alfred , Archbishop of Yorke , there present , and president of the assembly , stoutly and prudently gave his counsell forthwith to consecrate and crowne young Edgar Atheling ( the true heire ) for their king , to whom consented likewise both the sea-captaines and the Londoners . But the Earles of Yorkeshire and Cheshire , Edwin and Morcar ( whom this fearefull state of their country could not disswade from disloyaltie and ambition ) , plotting secretly to get the crown themselves , hindred that wise and noble designe . In which , while the sorrowfull Queene , their sister , was conueyed to Westchester , where , without state or title of a Queene , she led a solitary and quiet life .</p>
   <p>“ The mother of the slaine King did not so well moderate her womanly passions as to receive either comfort or counsell of her friends : the dead body of her sonne shee greatly desired , and to that end sent to the Conquerour two sage brethren of his Abbey at Waltham , who had accompanied him in his unfortunate expedition . Their names ( as I finde them recorded in an olde manuscript ) were Osegod and Ailric , whose message to the Conquerour , not without abundance of teares and feare , is there set downe in the tenour as followeth :</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Noble Duke , and ere long to be a most great and mightie King , we thy most humble servants , destitute of all comfort ( as we would we were also of life ) are come to thee as sent from our brethren , whom this dead King hath placed in the monastery of Waltham , to attend the issue of this late dreadfull battaile ( wherein God favouring thy quarrell , he is now taken away and dead , which was our greatest comforter , and by whose onely bountifull goodenesse we were relieved and maintained , whom hee had placed to serve God in that church ) . Wherefore wee most humbly request thee ( now our dread lord ) by that gracious favour which the Lord of lords hath showed unto thee , and for the reliefe of their soules , who in this quarrell have ended their dayes , that it may be lawfull for us by thy good leave safely to take and carry away with us the dead body of the King , the founder and builder of our church and monasterie ; as also the bodies of such others as whom , for the reverence of him and for his sake , desired also to be buried with us , that the state of our church by their helpe strengthened , may be the stronger , and endure the firmer . ’ With whose so humble a request , and abundant teares , the victorious and worthy Duke moved , answered :</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Your King ( said he ) unmindfull of his faith , although he have for the present endured the worthy punishment of his fault , yet hath he not therefore deserved to want the honour of a sepulchre or to lie unburied : were it but that he died a King , howsoever he came by the kingdom , my purpose is , for the reverence of him , and for the health of them who , having left their wives and possessions , have here in my quarrel lost their lives , to build here a church and a monastery with an hundred monkes in it , to pray for them for ever , and in the same church to bury your King above the rest , with all honour unto so great a prince , and for his sake to endow the same with great revenewes . ’</p>
   <p>“ With which his courteous speech and promises , the two religious fathers , comforted and encouraged , again replied :</p>
   <p>“ ‘ Not so , noble Duke , but grant this thy servants ’ most humble request , that we may , for God , by thy leave , receive the dead body of our founder , and to bury it in the place which himself in his lifetime appointed , that wee , cheered with the presence of his body , may thereof take comfort , and that his tombe may be unto our successors a perpetual monument of his remembrance . ’</p>
   <p>“ The Duke , as he was of disposition gracious , and inclined to mercy , forthwith granted their desires , whereupon they drew out stores of gold to present him in way of gratulation , which he not only utterly refused , but also offered them plenty to supply whatsoever should be needfull for the pompe of his funerall , as also for their costs in travaile to and fro , giving strait commandments that none of his souldiers should persume to molest them in this businesse or in their returne . Then went they in haste to the quarry of the dead , but by no meanes could find the body of the King ; for the countenances of all men greatly alter by death , but being maimed and imbrued with bloud , they are not known to be the men they were . As for his other regall ornaments which might have shewed him for their King , his dead corps was despoyled of them , either through the greedy desire of prey ( as the manner of the field is ) or to be the first bringer of such happy news , in hope of a princely reward , upon which purpose many times the body is both mangled and dismembred , and so was this King after his death by a base souldier gasht and hackt into the legge , whom Duke William rewarded for so unsouldier like a deed , cashiering him for ever out of his wages and warres . So that Harold , lying stript , wounded , bemangled , and goared in his bloud , could not be founde nor knowne till they sent for a woman named Editha ( for her passing beautie surnamed Swan-shals , that is , Swan'shYpppHeNnecke ) , whom hee entertained in secret love before he was King , who by some secret marks of his body , to her well knowne , found him out , and then put into a coffine , was by divers of the Norman nobilitie honourably brought unto the place afterward called Battle Bridge , where it was met by the nobles of England , and , so conveyed to Waltham , was there solemnly and with great lamentation of his mother , royally interred , with this rude epitaph ,<span corresp="#note111" type="note_anchor">[ 111 ]</span>well beseeming the time , though not the person .</p>
   <p>“ Goodwine , the eldest son of the King Harold , being growne to some ripenesse of years in y ^ e life of his father , after his death and overthrow by the Conquerour , took his brother with him and flew over into Ireland , from whence he returned and landed in Somersetshire , slew Edmoth ( a baron sometimes of his fathers ) that encountered him , and taking great preyes in Devonshire and Cornwell , departed till the next yeare ; when , comeing again , he fought with Beorn and Earle of Cornwall , and after retired into Ireland , and thence went into Denmarke to King Swayn , his cosen-german , where he spent the rest of his life .</p>
   <p>“ Edmund , the second sonne to King Harold , went with his brother into Ireland , returned with him into England , and was at the slaughter and overthrow of Edmoth and his power in Somersetshire , at the spoyles committed in Cornwall and Devonshire , at the conflict with the Cornish Earle Beorn , passed , repassed with him in all his voyages , invasions , and warres , by sea and by land , in England and Ireland ; and at the last departed with him from Ireland to Denmarke , tooke part with him of all pleasure and calamitie whatsoever , and attending and depending wholly upon him , lived and died with him in that country .</p>
   <p>“ Magnus , the third sonne of the King Harold , went with his brothers into Ireland , and returned with them the first time into England , and is never after that mentioned amongst them , nor elsewhere , unlesse ( as some conjecture ) he be that Magnus , who , seeing the mutability of humane affaires , became an anchoret , whose epitaph , pointing to his Danish originall , the learned Clarenciaux discovered in a little desolate church at Lewes , in Sussex , where , in the gaping chinks of an arch in the wall , in a rude and over worne character , certain old imperfect verses were found . ”</p>
   <p>A daughter , whose name is not known , left England with her brothers , and sought refuge with them in Denmark .</p>
   <p>Speed quotes Saxo Grammaticus , who says , “ She afterwards married Waldemar , King of Russia . ” To this daughter I have given the name and character assigned to her in the poem .</p>

   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>This poem was first published under the name of “ One of the Living Poets of Great Britain . ” I have thought it best to revise and publish it in my own name , and as it is the last written by me , and the last I may ever live to write , I have added , from volumes long out of print , some selected verses of my earliest days of song .<span corresp="#note112" type="note_anchor">[ 112 ]</span></p>
   <p>Since these were written , I have lived to hear the sounds of other harps , whose masters have struck far more sublime chords , and died . I have lived to see among them females<span corresp="#note113" type="note_anchor">[ 113 ]</span>of the highest poetical rank , and many illustrious masters of the lyre , whose names I need not specify , crowned with younger and more verdant laurels , which they yet gracefully wear . Some who now rank high in the poet 's art have acknowledged that their feelings were first excited by these youthful strains , which I have now , with melancholy feelings , revised for the last time .</p>
   <p>It is a consolation that , from youth to age , I have found no line I wished to blot , or departed a moment from the severer taste which I imbibed from the simplest and purest models of classical composition .</p>

      <l n="18">‘ Twas in the rugged and forsaken isle</l>
      <l n="19">Of Patmos , dreariest of the sister isles</l>
      <l n="20">Which strew the AEgean , where the pirate , wont</l>
      <l n="21">To rove the seas with scymitar of blood ,</l>
      <l n="22">Now scowled in sullen exile , an old man ,</l>
      <l n="23">Tranquilly listening to the ocean-sounds ,</l>
      <l n="24">And resting on his staff , beside a cave , 7</l>
      <l n="25">Gazed on the setting sun , as it went down</l>
      <l n="26">In glory o'er the distant hills of Greece .</l>
      <l n="27">Pale precipices frowned above the track</l>
      <l n="28">Of dark gray sands and stone ; nor wood nor stream</l>
      <l n="29">Cheered the lone valleys , desolate , and sad ,</l>
      <l n="30">And silent ; not a goat amid the crags</l>
      <l n="31">Wandering , and picking here and there a blade</l>
      <l n="32">Of withered grass , above the sea-marge hung .</l>
      <l n="33">The robber<span corresp="#note114" type="note_anchor">[ 114 ]</span>scowled , and spoke not ; his dark eye</l>
      <l n="34">Still flashed unconquered pride , and sullen hate</l>
      <l n="35">To man , and , looking on his iron chain ,</l>
      <l n="36">He muttered to himself a deeper curse .</l>
      <l n="37">The old man had his dwelling in a cave , 20</l>
      <l n="38">Half-way upon the desert mountain 's side ,</l>
      <l n="39">Now bent with the full weight of eighty years</l>
      <l n="40">And upwards ; and that caverned mountain-crag</l>
      <l n="41">Five years had been his dwelling :[ 115 ] there he sat ,</l>
      <l n="42">Oft holding converse , not with forms of earth ,</l>
      <l n="43">But , as was said , with spirits of the blessed ,</l>
      <l n="44">Beyond this cloudy sphere , or with the dead</l>
      <l n="45">Of other days . A girdle bound his loins ;</l>
      <l n="46">Figs and Icarian honey were his food ;</l>
      <l n="47">An ill-carved cup by a clear fount was seen ; 30</l>
      <l n="48">His long locks and his white descending beard</l>
      <l n="49">Shook when he tottered down into the sun ,</l>
      <l n="50">Supported by a slender cross of pine ,</l>
      <l n="51">His staff ; and when the evening star arose</l>
      <l n="52">O'er Asia , a brief time he stood and gazed ,</l>
      <l n="53">Then sought his melancholy cave and prayed .</l>
      <l n="54">And who , in this sad place , was this old man ?</l>
      <l n="55">Who , in this island , where the robber scowled ,</l>
      <l n="56">Was this old man , exiled and destitute —</l>
      <l n="57">Old , but so reverenced , the murderer passed 40</l>
      <l n="58">His rocky dwelling , and bade peace to it ?</l>
      <l n="59">‘ Twas he who leaned upon our Saviour 's breast</l>
      <l n="60">At the last supper ; he to whom the Lord ,</l>
      <l n="61">Looking upon his countenance of youth ,</l>
      <l n="62">His calm , clear forehead , and his clustering hair ,</l>
      <l n="63">Said , What if he shall tarry till I come !</l>
      <l n="64">Long years — and many sorrows marked these years —</l>
      <l n="65">Had passed since this was said ; and now that face</l>
      <l n="66">Was furrowed o'er with age ; and weariness</l>
      <l n="67">And exile , in the last lone days of life , 50</l>
      <l n="68">Were now his lot ; for they whom he had loved —</l>
      <l n="69">They , the disciples of “ Him crucified ” —</l>
      <l n="70">Professing one warm faith , one glorious hope ,</l>
      <l n="71">Were all , in the same faith and the same hope ,</l>
      <l n="72">Laid down in peace , after their pilgrimage ,</l>
      <l n="73">Where the world ceased from troubling .</l>
      <l n="74">He alone</l>
      <l n="75">Lingered when all were dead , with fervent prayer</l>
      <l n="76">Soon in the bosom of his Lord to rest .</l>
      <l n="77">And now he comes forth from his rocky cave 60</l>
      <l n="78">To gaze a while upon the silent sea ,</l>
      <l n="79">In the calm eventide of the Lord 's day ;</l>
      <l n="80">To think on Him he loved , and of that voice</l>
      <l n="81">Once heard on earth : so , pondering , on his staff ,</l>
      <l n="82">The old man watched another sun go down</l>
      <l n="83">Beyond the Cape of Tenos .<span corresp="#note116" type="note_anchor">[ 116 ]</span>The still sea</l>
      <l n="84">Slept , in the light of eve , beneath his feet ,</l>
      <l n="85">And often , as in very gentleness ,</l>
      <l n="86">It seemed to touch his sandals , and retire .</l>
      <l n="87">And now the last limb of the sinking orb 70</l>
      <l n="88">Is hid , yet far away the cloudy track</l>
      <l n="89">Reddens with its departing glory .</l>
      <l n="90">Hark ! 73</l>
      <l n="91">A voice , and , lo ! seven “ golden candlesticks ,"[ 117 ]</l>
      <l n="92">The “ Angels of the Churches ” upon earth ,</l>
      <l n="93">“ Seven golden candlesticks , ” and He , the Lord ,</l>
      <l n="94">Among them , like unto that Son of God</l>
      <l n="95">Who radiant on the mount of vision<span corresp="#note118" type="note_anchor">[ 118 ]</span>stood ,</l>
      <l n="96">Now recognised the same , in the same shape .</l>
      <l n="97">His hair was white as snow ; his eyes were flame ; 80</l>
      <l n="98">His voice , the sound of waters ; in his hand —</l>
      <l n="99">His raised right hand — seven stars ; his countenance</l>
      <l n="100">As the bright sun , that shineth in his strength ;</l>
      <l n="101">And yet serene as the descending day .</l>
      <l n="102">It was the Lord : the old man at his feet</l>
      <l n="103">Fell down as dead ; the apparition stood</l>
      <l n="104">Glorious above his head , and spoke :</l>
      <l n="105">Fear not ;</l>
      <l n="106">I am the first and last ; the last and first :</l>
      <l n="107">Lo , I am he that liveth , and was dead : 90</l>
      <l n="108">And now , behold , I live for evermore —</l>
      <l n="109">For evermore , and have the keys of hell</l>
      <l n="110">And death !<span corresp="#note119" type="note_anchor">[ 119 ]</span></l>
      <l n="111">The glory passed — and all around</l>
      <l n="112">Is still as death : the old man sinks to earth ,</l>
      <l n="113">Astonied , faint , and pale . When the slow sense</l>
      <l n="114">Struggled to recollection , he looked around ,</l>
      <l n="115">Yet trembling ; but no voice was heard ; no form</l>
      <l n="116">Stood , bending in its glory , o'er him .</l>
      <l n="117">Then seemed the hills of that forsaken isle 100</l>
      <l n="118">More dreary ; and the promontories bare</l>
      <l n="119">Lifted their weather-beaten brows more dark</l>
      <l n="120">And desolate . Back to his lonely cave</l>
      <l n="121">The old man passed ; and , wrapped in thoughts of heaven ,</l>
      <l n="122">Lifted in prayer his clasped emaciate hands ; 105</l>
      <l n="123">Then on his bed of rushes in the cave</l>
      <l n="124">Lay down to rest till dawn . What was his dream ?</l>
      <l n="125">He saw again , as when the rocks were rent ,</l>
      <l n="126">And “ darkness at midday was o'er the land , ”</l>
      <l n="127">His Saviour calmly bowing his meek head 110</l>
      <l n="128">Upon the cross : he heard that thrilling voice</l>
      <l n="129">Even from the cross , Woman , behold thy son !</l>
      <l n="130">Son , look upon thy mother !</l>
      <l n="131">Then he saw</l>
      <l n="132">The forms of those whom he had loved on earth ,</l>
      <l n="133">And heard their voices still ; and stood entranced ,</l>
      <l n="134">With Peter and with James , upon the mount</l>
      <l n="135">Of glorious vision ; now he saw , in dreams ,</l>
      <l n="136">Again the glistening apparition rise ,</l>
      <l n="137">And stand above him . He has tarried long 120</l>
      <l n="138">And lonely in the world : the vision comes</l>
      <l n="139">To animate his hopes — to say , Live , live</l>
      <l n="140">With me , for evermore ! And , lo , the keys !</l>
      <l n="141">This opens the bright mansions of the blessed ;</l>
      <l n="142">This closes the eternal gates of hell ,</l>
      <l n="143">Upon the gnashing of the teeth , and groans</l>
      <l n="144">Unutterable . So the Saviour spoke ,</l>
      <l n="145">As seemed in his sleep . Ah ! the stern shade</l>
      <l n="146">Of murdered Caesar rises : Art thou dead ,</l>
      <l n="147">King of the world ? for this didst thou proclaim 130</l>
      <l n="148">Thyself a god — a living god on earth ?<span corresp="#note120" type="note_anchor">[ 120 ]</span></l>
      <l n="149">Let the pit hide thee ! But thou art a god !</l>
      <l n="150">Then bid the fury of these flames assuage</l>
      <l n="151">Ere they reach thee ! Who shrieked ?</l>
      <l n="152">At the sound ,</l>
      <l n="153">The ancient and the solitary man</l>
      <l n="154">Started from sleep</l>
      <l n="155">The cold gray dawn appeared , 138</l>
      <l n="156">When , standing opposite , with steadfast look ,</l>
      <l n="157">And in the glimmer of the inmost cave ,</l>
      <l n="158">He saw a stranger .</l>
      <l n="159">Whence and who art thou ?</l>
      <l n="160">With trembling voice he asked — whence ? who art thou ?</l>
      <l n="161">Perhaps the spirit of this dismal isle !</l>
      <l n="162">Or , cast upon these melancholy rocks ,</l>
      <l n="163">A poor and world-forsaken thing , like me !</l>
      <l n="164">The stranger gazed unmoved , and answered not :</l>
      <l n="165">His looks were those of pity — of respect —</l>
      <l n="166">As mingling thoughtful wisdom with the grace</l>
      <l n="167">Of beauty . In his hand he held a book : 150</l>
      <l n="168">He opened it ; and never light appeared</l>
      <l n="169">So fair as that on his majestic brow ,</l>
      <l n="170">For now the sun had risen , and its beams</l>
      <l n="171">Shot far into the cave .</l>
      <l n="172">John gazed with awe</l>
      <l n="173">On that majestic man , he knew not why ;</l>
      <l n="174">And well might he have gazed with reverence ,</l>
      <l n="175">For here , in this rude spot , he only saw</l>
      <l n="176">Men the most dark and savage of their kind ,</l>
      <l n="177">Murderers , and ruthless criminals in chains . 160</l>
      <l n="178">He spoke to them of truth and righteousness —</l>
      <l n="179">He spoke of an offended God ! Some looked</l>
      <l n="180">To the bright sun , defying ; others turned</l>
      <l n="181">Muttering . He spoke of pity , and they heard ,</l>
      <l n="182">Even as the relentless hurricane</l>
      <l n="183">Hears the last prayer of the faint mariner ,</l>
      <l n="184">Whom wintry waves had dashed upon the rocks .</l>
      <l n="185">Yet ever with the gentlest offices ,</l>
      <l n="186">With tears and prayers the holy exile strove</l>
      <l n="187">To wake their better feelings , for he laid 170</l>
      <l n="188">His hands upon the sick , and they looked up</l>
      <l n="189">With hope and blessed him , and , restored to strength ,</l>
      <l n="190">Forgot the vows they made ; him , too , who died 173</l>
      <l n="191">Hardened , and , as to human eyes , in sin ,</l>
      <l n="192">He laid in the cold grave , and said a prayer</l>
      <l n="193">For mercy to the God of all , the Judge ,</l>
      <l n="194">To whom all hearts be open , and from whom</l>
      <l n="195">No secret thought is hid — and , self-accused ,</l>
      <l n="196">Mortal himself , presumed not to condemn .</l>
      <l n="197">So passed this ancient holy man his days , 180</l>
      <l n="198">Peaceful , amid the banished criminals ,</l>
      <l n="199">Banished and poor himself , but living thus ,</l>
      <l n="200">Among the sternest of their kind , he prayed</l>
      <l n="201">For their salvation :— so he passed his days</l>
      <l n="202">Peaceful , but sad ; and now , with anxious gaze ,</l>
      <l n="203">He turned his look to the mysterious man ,</l>
      <l n="204">Who , steadfastly beholding him , thus spoke :</l>
      <l n="205">The voice of prophecy has been fulfilled ;</l>
      <l n="206">Where is the Temple ? where Jerusalem ?</l>
      <l n="207">Ah ! wretched city ! Famine , war , and woe 190</l>
      <l n="208">Have done their destined work . The living drops<span corresp="#note121" type="note_anchor">[ 121 ]</span></l>
      <l n="209">Dead on the carcase he is burying !</l>
      <l n="210">That famished babe is black ! Oh ! turn away !</l>
      <l n="211">All — all is silent now ; and thou hast seen</l>
      <l n="212">This prophecy fulfilled , for not one stone</l>
      <l n="213">Of beautiful and sacred Solima</l>
      <l n="214">Is left upon another ! He who died ,</l>
      <l n="215">When he beheld the city , o'er it wept ,</l>
      <l n="216">And said , O daughters of Jerusalem !</l>
      <l n="217">Weep not for me , but for your little ones ! 200</l>
      <l n="218">The tender words — dost thou remember them ?</l>
      <l n="219">Jerusalem , Jerusalem ! how oft</l>
      <l n="220">Would I have gathered up those little ones ,</l>
      <l n="221">Even as a hen beneath a mother 's wing ; 204</l>
      <l n="222">But ye would not : and now , behold your house</l>
      <l n="223">Is left unto you desolate ! Alas !</l>
      <l n="224">How desolate ! But even in those last days</l>
      <l n="225">Warning was given , if yet they would repent .</l>
      <l n="226">A bloody sword , like a red comet , hung</l>
      <l n="227">Above the Temple , and a strange sad light 210</l>
      <l n="228">Sat on the altar ; while the inner gate ,</l>
      <l n="229">Untouched , at midnight burst its brazen bars ,</l>
      <l n="230">And stood wide open ; armed men did fight</l>
      <l n="231">Amid the clouds ; and , in the dead of night ,</l>
      <l n="232">The pale priest heard a voice , Depart ! depart !<span corresp="#note122" type="note_anchor">[ 122 ]</span></l>
      <l n="233">So the fair city of Jerusalem</l>
      <l n="234">Perished : but , lo ! Christ 's holy Church shall rise —</l>
      <l n="235">Rise from its ashes — yea , is risen now ;</l>

     <l n="33">When mild Evodias<span corresp="#note132" type="note_anchor">[ 132 ]</span>filled St Peter 's chair ;</l>
     <l n="34">And fair that place , as well beseems the spot</l>
     <l n="35">Where first the Christian name<span corresp="#note133" type="note_anchor">[ 133 ]</span>was heard .</l>
     <l n="36">The Vale</l>
     <l n="37">Of Tempe , sung through Greece , is not so fair</l>

     <l n="42">I heard Evodias , and from youth I loved</l>
     <l n="43">To wander ‘ mid the scenes of old renown ,</l>
     <l n="44">Hallowed by prophets , and by holy men ,</l>
     <l n="45">Who long from earth had passed . How beautiful</l>
     <l n="46">Upon those hills and mountains were the feet</l>
     <l n="47">Of them who brought glad tidings of the light ,</l>
     <l n="48">Now risen on the darkened world !</l>
     <l n="49">I sat</l>
     <l n="50">Upon a stone of fallen Jerusalem , 60</l>
     <l n="51">Sat down and wept , when I remembered thee ,</l>
     <l n="52">O Sion ! and thy Temple , and thy sons</l>
     <l n="53">Scattered in the wide world — scattered or dead !</l>
     <l n="54">Like him , the mighty prophet ,<span corresp="#note134" type="note_anchor">[ 134 ]</span>who of yore</l>
     <l n="55">Watched the dark gathering of the clouds and rain ,</l>
     <l n="56">I stood upon Mount Carmel , and beheld</l>
     <l n="57">The great sea westward . Hark ! Euroclydon<span corresp="#note135" type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span></l>
     <l n="58">Is up ; the tempest rushes from the east ;</l>
     <l n="59">Fire and the whirlwind follow ; but , O God !</l>
     <l n="60">Thou art not in the whirlwind nor the fire . 70</l>
     <l n="61">And , after , came a still small voice , which said ,</l>
     <l n="62">Go , visit John , sad and in solitude .</l>
     <l n="63">We sailed from Joppa , in a Tyrian ship ,</l>
     <l n="64">To Rhodes : a skiff was waiting near the shore ,</l>
     <l n="65">On which the shadowy moonlight seemed to rest ;</l>
     <l n="66">Then a pale mariner , who never spoke ,</l>
     <l n="67">Conveyed me hither , swift as silently —</l>
     <l n="68">Swift , though the passing keel no murmur made ,</l>
     <l n="69">As the dim sail no shadow cast . I looked ,</l>
     <l n="70">When I had reached the shore , and it was gone ! 80</l>
     <l n="71">I saw thy mountain-cave : I stood and gazed</l>
     <l n="72">A while on thy gray hairs as thou didst sleep ,</l>
     <l n="73">And the same voice which came , after the wind ,</l>
     <l n="74">Said audibly , Reveal to him the things</l>
     <l n="75">That shall hereafter be , as I unfold .</l>
     <l n="76">I watched when the great vision came to thee ,</l>
     <l n="77">Hearing the voice and answer : it was sent</l>
     <l n="78">To animate thy hope ! Art thou refreshed ,</l>
     <l n="79">As now these airs of morn blow soothingly ,</l>
     <l n="80">And breathe a sad repose ? John placed his hand , 90</l>
     <l n="81">Pale and emaciate , on his breast , and said :</l>
     <l n="82">Thy words might raise from earth the heaviest heart .</l>
     <l n="83">Then both in silence gazed on the blue sea ,<span corresp="#note136" type="note_anchor">[ 136 ]</span></l>
     <l n="84">And heard it murmuring . John his full look</l>
     <l n="85">Towards his face who spoke now turned intent ,</l>
     <l n="86">To mark his features . Dignity serene</l>
     <l n="87">Was on that face ; and as the freshening airs</l>
     <l n="88">Stirred the dark locks that clustered round his brow ,</l>
     <l n="89">A faint rose mantled on his cheek ; his cloak ,</l>
     <l n="90">Gathered upon his breast , descending touched 100</l>
     <l n="91">His sandals ; whilst , with more majestic mien ,</l>
     <l n="92">Pointing to Asia 's hills , he spoke again :</l>
     <l n="93">Old man , lift up thine eyes — turn to the east : 103</l>

     <l n="108">Falling , the heavy sound of battering-rams :</l>
     <l n="109">We passed the victims , blackening in the sun , 440</l>
     <l n="110">And some , yet breathing , on the crucifix .<span corresp="#note162" type="note_anchor">[ 162 ]</span></l>
     <l n="111">On , through the valley of Jehoshaphat ,</l>
     <l n="112">I spurred my horse ; we passed the sepulchre</l>
     <l n="113">Of Lazarus , restored from the dark grave ,</l>
     <l n="114">So those who own the faith of Christ affirm ,</l>
     <l n="115">With eye-balls ghastly glaring in the light ,</l>
     <l n="116">At the loud voice of Him who cried , Come forth !</l>
     <l n="117">We held our eastern way from Bethany ,</l>
     <l n="118">Till now we reached the “ Plain of Blood . "[ 163 ] I paused</l>
     <l n="119">A moment , ere we entered that sad plain . 450</l>
     <l n="120">Ah ! there are tents upon the southern edge</l>
     <l n="121">Of the horizon ! Fly ! it is the camp</l>
     <l n="122">Of Arabs : see ! with long and couched spears ,</l>
     <l n="123">A troop is flying o'er the sands ! We hear</l>
     <l n="124">Their cries — this way they rush — this way —</l>
     <l n="125">Fly ! fly ! and instant , as an arrow speeds ,</l>
     <l n="126">( My pale companion breathless , and scarce held )</l>
     <l n="127">We bounded o'er the desert , till the track 458</l>
     <l n="128">Was lost . The voices died away : she sank</l>
     <l n="129">Faint in my arms , and with her head declined</l>
     <l n="130">Upon my breastplate . We will rest a while ;</l>
     <l n="131">For she was now so feeble , it behoved</l>
     <l n="132">Thus oft to rest , if haply she might feel</l>
     <l n="133">Some cool reviving airs breathe on her face ,</l>
     <l n="134">Gently ; a few dry dates were all our food .</l>
     <l n="135">We gazed in silence on the sun , that , red ,</l>
     <l n="136">Was sinking now beyond the lonely sands ,</l>
     <l n="137">And hurriedly again renewed our flight .</l>
     <l n="138">The track is lost ! Fear not — those are the bones ,</l>
     <l n="139">Not of a murdered traveller . Look out ! 470</l>
     <l n="140">Is that a cloud ? or seest thou not the smoke</l>
     <l n="141">Of some lone cottage on the hills ? List ! list !</l>
     <l n="142">Is it the tinkle of some rivulet ,</l>
     <l n="143">Wandering in solitude ? On , on , my steed !</l>
     <l n="144">We reached the hills , and , looking back , beheld</l>
     <l n="145">The western cope of heaven , as night came down ,</l>
     <l n="146">All fiery red . It was the light , far off ,</l>
     <l n="147">Of the proud Temple flaming ! Through the night</l>
     <l n="148">We held our toiling way , when , at gray dawn ,</l>
     <l n="149">We saw , beneath us , palms , and city walls , 480</l>
     <l n="150">And Jordan , slowly flowing to the south .</l>
     <l n="151">Yes ! these are palms and walls of Jericho ;</l>
     <l n="152">But all was silent and forsaken . War</l>
     <l n="153">Had blown his trump ; and Pity , at the blast ,</l>
     <l n="154">Had knelt in tears , and hid her face to hear</l>
     <l n="155">That deep , dire groan ; but it is heard no more ,</l>
     <l n="156">For Silence , Solitude , and Ruin sit ,</l>
     <l n="157">Mocking each other , at the city gates .</l>
     <l n="158">Here were no murmurs of tumultuous life .</l>
     <l n="159">We joined a mourning train , that held their way , 490</l>
     <l n="160">Women , and children , and white-headed men ,</l>
     <l n="161">Forlorn , by Jordan 's banks , to Galilee , 492</l>
     <l n="162">Seeking the city of Tiberias .</l>
     <l n="163">With many tears , my poor companion told</l>
     <l n="164">Her tale : a daughter of Jerusalem</l>
     <l n="165">Implored their pity ; and the daggers , raised</l>
     <l n="166">To pierce a Roman soldier to the heart ,</l>
     <l n="167">Were in the act arrested , for her sake —</l>
     <l n="168">Trifosa , of the tribe of Benjamin ,</l>
     <l n="169">Who owed her life and safety to his sword . 500</l>
     <l n="170">We reached the city : here she had a friend ,</l>
     <l n="171">Widowed like her , who wept to hear her tale .</l>
     <l n="172">Here , wedded , and by Israel 's laws made one ,</l>
     <l n="173">I lived — a fisher toiling with his net</l>
     <l n="174">To gain our daily bread ; but soon my heart</l>
     <l n="175">Beat for a wider scene — for enterprise ,</l>
     <l n="176">The soul of a young soldier ; and with thoughts</l>
     <l n="177">Stirring and restless , after twelve long months ,</l>
     <l n="178">We came , by Tabor , to the western sea .</l>
     <l n="179">I had a robber 's cavern at the foot 510</l>
     <l n="180">Of Carmel , and oft skirred the neighbouring plains</l>
     <l n="181">On my fleet battle-horse , with spurs of blood .</l>
     <l n="182">Here I was joined by soldiers , desperate</l>
     <l n="183">And outcast as myself ; we were a band</l>
     <l n="184">Of secret and of fearful brotherhood</l>
     <l n="185">That tenanted these caverns . But my wife ,</l>
     <l n="186">When we were absent , and the cave was still ,</l>
     <l n="187">Wept , for the love of those who were no more ;</l>
     <l n="188">Trembled , and wept for me . When I returned ,</l>
     <l n="189">Weary , at night , she sat and sang to me ; 520</l>
     <l n="190">And sometimes , when she was alone whole days ,</l>
     <l n="191">She wandered o'er the mountains , gathering flowers ,</l>
     <l n="192">Hyacinths , lilies , and anemones ;<span corresp="#note164" type="note_anchor">[ 164 ]</span></l>
     <l n="193">And when my hands were bloody , gave me them ,</l>
     <l n="194">With trembling hand , and sadness in her look . 525</l>
     <l n="195">Why should I think , or sigh , or feel remorse !</l>
     <l n="196">Was I not leader of the bravest band</l>
     <l n="197">That ever shook their flashing scymitars</l>
     <l n="198">Against the morning sun ! But , oh ! that look !</l>
     <l n="199">How has it thrilled , even to my inmost heart : 530</l>
     <l n="200">One child , the pledge of warm affection , died ,</l>
     <l n="201">And now she roved in morning dew no more ;</l>
     <l n="202">And oft , when I returned with gore-stained brow ,</l>
     <l n="203">I saw a strange , sad wandering in her eyes .</l>
     <l n="204">Alas ! her gentle mind was gone ! She sang —</l>
     <l n="205">She gazed upon my face — she smiled — she died —</l>
     <l n="206">And her last words were , O Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="207">Jerusalem ! I buried her in peace ,</l>
     <l n="208">Without a name , among the mountain flowers .</l>
     <l n="209">And now my heart was hardened as a rock 540</l>
     <l n="210">Against the world . I heard no soothing voice ;</l>
     <l n="211">I never looked upon a human face</l>
     <l n="212">With tenderness again ; a darker shade</l>
     <l n="213">Of passions gathered on my lonely heart ,</l>
     <l n="214">Till love , and charity , and pity died .</l>
     <l n="215">I may not say what I have seen and done :</l>
     <l n="216">Here I have lived a fettered slave seven years ;</l>
     <l n="217">Here thy mild voice has called back to my heart</l>
     <l n="218">Sad recollections . Father ,— and he knelt</l>
     <l n="219">And kissed his withered hand , and cried again , 550</l>
     <l n="220">Oh ! father , pray for me !</l>
     <l n="221">The stranger stood</l>
     <l n="222">Unmoved , but tears were on the old man 's cheek .</l>

     <l n="42">Another glorious angel came , who bore</l>
     <l n="43">Thy seal , O living God ; and a loud voice</l>

     <l n="60">Be to our God , for ever and for ever !</l>
     <l n="61">Then seemed that one among the elders spake</l>
     <l n="62">To John , and said , What are these multitudes</l>
     <l n="63">Who bear triumphant palms , all clothed in white ?</l>
     <l n="64">John answered , Sir , thou knowest . He replied , 110</l>
     <l n="65">These are victorious saints , who have come out</l>
     <l n="66">From the great tribulation , and have washed</l>
     <l n="67">Their bloody garments , and have made them white —</l>
     <l n="68">White through His blood who died upon the cross ;</l>
     <l n="69">Therefore they stand before the throne of God , 115</l>
     <l n="70">And in his temple serve him day and night ,</l>
     <l n="71">And He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell</l>
     <l n="72">Among them . They shall hunger now no more ,</l>
     <l n="73">Nor thirst ; the sun shall cheer them , but not burn ;</l>
     <l n="74">The Lamb shall feed them , and shall lead them forth 120</l>
     <l n="75">To pleasant pastures , and to fountains bright ,</l>
     <l n="76">And from their eyelids wipe away all tears</l>
     <l n="77">For ever .</l>
     <l n="78">There was silence in the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="79">When the seventh seal was opened , and John saw</l>
     <l n="80">Seven angels standing by the throne of God ,</l>
     <l n="81">Having seven trumpets ; and an angel came ,</l>
     <l n="82">Who , hovering , with a golden censer , stood</l>
     <l n="83">Before an altar , and the smoke went up ,</l>
     <l n="84">Of incense , from the altar . These are prayers 130</l>
     <l n="85">Of all the saints on earth — prayers which ascend ,</l>
     <l n="86">Like incense , from the censer in the hand</l>
     <l n="87">Of that bright angel , to the throne of God .</l>
     <l n="88">Ah ! he has cast his censer to the earth ;</l>
     <l n="89">And suddenly the earthquake and the storm</l>
     <l n="90">Awoke , and through the darkness , rolled and flashed</l>
     <l n="91">Deep thunders and the lightning ; and , behold !</l>
     <l n="92">The seven angels lift their trumpets high ,</l>
     <l n="93">Lift , and prepare to sound . And now the first</l>
     <l n="94">Sounds — and there follows instant hail , and fire 140</l>
     <l n="95">Mingled with blood , which on the earth was cast ;</l>
     <l n="96">So that the trees stood bare and desolate ,</l>
     <l n="97">And the green grass was withered and burnt up .</l>
     <l n="98">The second angel sounded , and , behold !</l>
     <l n="99">A burning mountain cast into the sea .</l>
     <l n="100">The third part of all creatures in the sea</l>
     <l n="101">Died , a third part of all the ships that sailed</l>
     <l n="102">Upon the sea was smitten and destroyed .</l>
     <l n="103">And the third angel sounded ; and there fell 149</l>
     <l n="104">A star from heaven . It fell on the third part</l>
     <l n="105">Of rivers , and the fountains of the deep ;</l>
     <l n="106">And swollen and livid carcases were left ,</l>
     <l n="107">Weltering , beside the dark , blood-heaving sea .</l>
     <l n="108">And the fourth angel sounded ; and the sun</l>
     <l n="109">For the third part was smitten , and the moon</l>
     <l n="110">For the third part was darkened ; and John saw</l>
     <l n="111">And heard an angel flying in mid heaven ,</l>
     <l n="112">And crying with a mighty voice , Woe , woe ,</l>
     <l n="113">Woe to the earth , by reason of the voice</l>
     <l n="114">Of the three trumpets that are yet to sound ! 160</l>
     <l n="115">And the fifth trumpet sounded ; and John saw</l>
     <l n="116">A star fall from the heavens to the earth ;</l>
     <l n="117">And to the angel of the star was given</l>
     <l n="118">The key that shuts the nethermost abyss</l>
     <l n="119">Upon the groans of those that groan therein .</l>
     <l n="120">The pit is opened , and the volumed smoke ,</l>
     <l n="121">Shooting red flames , as from a furnace , rolls ,</l>
     <l n="122">And out of it there issued crawling things ,<span corresp="#note172" type="note_anchor">[ 172 ]</span></l>
     <l n="123">Like scorpions ; but they had no power to hurt</l>
     <l n="124">The green grass of the earth , but those alone 170</l>
     <l n="125">Who on their foreheads had no seal of heaven :</l>
     <l n="126">These shall seek death , but find him not , for death</l>
     <l n="127">Shall fly from them , when they most pray to die .</l>
     <l n="128">Like horses trained for battle , a dire troop</l>
     <l n="129">Comes sounding ; on their heads are crowns , like gold ;</l>
     <l n="130">Faces are theirs , like men ; and they have hair</l>
     <l n="131">As women , and teeth white and terrible</l>
     <l n="132">As lions ; and their iron breastplates shake ,</l>
     <l n="133">With hurtling noise ; the sounding of their wings</l>
     <l n="134">Is as the chariots and the steeds of war , 180</l>
     <l n="135">Rushing to the thick war . Who is their king ? 181</l>
     <l n="136">Apollyon , angel of the deep abyss .</l>
     <l n="137">One woe is past , yet two more woes remain ;</l>
     <l n="138">For the sixth angel sounded , and John heard</l>
     <l n="139">A voice like thunders : The four angels loose ,</l>
     <l n="140">In the great river of Euphrates bound .</l>
     <l n="141">And the four giant angels are unbound ,</l>
     <l n="142">And they go forth to slaughter . And John saw</l>
     <l n="143">The horses in the vision , and he saw</l>
     <l n="144">Those who sat on them , with breastplates of fire , 190</l>
     <l n="145">Of jacinth , and of sulphur ; and the heads</l>
     <l n="146">Of the gaunt horses were as lions ’ heads ,</l>
     <l n="147">And from their mouths issued red fire and smoke .</l>
     <l n="148">But men repented not , nor turned away</l>
     <l n="149">From their dark idols , or their sorceries ,</l>
     <l n="150">From worshipping their gods of gold , or stone ,</l>
     <l n="151">Or brass , or silver ! Hush ! the sound of wings !</l>
     <l n="152">Another mighty angel comes from heaven ,</l>
     <l n="153">And lights on earth , clothed in a radiant cloud .</l>
     <l n="154">There is a rainbow on his head ; his face 200</l>
     <l n="155">Is as the orient sun ; his feet appear</l>
     <l n="156">Pillars of fire ; in his right hand a book .</l>
     <l n="157">He sets his right foot on the seas , his left</l>
     <l n="158">Upon the earth , and cries , with a loud voice ,</l>
     <l n="159">Till the world shrinks : and when he thus has cried ,</l>
     <l n="160">Seven thunders answer , uttering to heaven</l>
     <l n="161">Their voices .</l>
     <l n="162">Then the angel said to John ,</l>
     <l n="163">Art thou about to write ? Seal up the things</l>
     <l n="164">Which the seven thunders uttered : write them not . 210</l>
     <l n="165">The angel which John saw stand on the seas ,</l>
     <l n="166">And on the earth , raised his right hand to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="167">And swore by Him which liveth , who shall live</l>
     <l n="168">For ever and for ever — swore by Him</l>
     <l n="169">Who made the heaven , the earth , and all therein , 215</l>
     <l n="170">That time shall be no more : the mystery</l>
     <l n="171">Of God shall be concluded in the days</l>
     <l n="172">Of this last angel 's voice . That awful voice</l>
     <l n="173">John heard entranced ; and the voice said to him ,</l>
     <l n="174">Take from the angel 's hand ,— the hand of him 220</l>
     <l n="175">Who standeth on the seas and on the earth ,—</l>
     <l n="176">That book thou markest open in his hand .</l>
     <l n="177">That book , the rapt Apostle cried , that book !</l>
     <l n="178">The angel mildly answered , Let thy heart</l>
     <l n="179">Feed on it ; sweet and bitter it shall be ,</l>
     <l n="180">And thou shalt prophesy of things to come ,</l>
     <l n="181">Of dark things yet to be upon the earth .</l>
     <l n="182">The seventh angel lifted high his trump ,</l>
     <l n="183">And sounded ; when from heaven a voice was heard —</l>
     <l n="184">The kingdoms of this world they are become 230</l>
     <l n="185">The kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ :</l>
     <l n="186">For ever and for ever , he shall reign ,</l>
     <l n="187">For ever and for ever .</l>
     <l n="188">Now the ark</l>
     <l n="189">Of God appeared ; and round about the ark</l>
     <l n="190">There was a rainbow stealing through the rain ,</l>
     <l n="191">The ark of the new covenant : and , lo !</l>
     <l n="192">A shining company stood with the Lamb</l>
     <l n="193">Upon Mount Zion , and a song was heard</l>
     <l n="194">Of harpers , harping a new song — the song 240</l>
     <l n="195">Of life and immortality . And John</l>
     <l n="196">Then heard a voice — a voice from heaven , which said ,</l>
     <l n="197">Write , write , From henceforth blessed are the dead</l>
     <l n="198">Which in the Lord shall die , for they shall rest</l>
     <l n="199">From all their labours ! Blessed are the dead !</l>
     <l n="200">The shadows are departed ; horse and trump</l>
     <l n="201">Are seen and heard no more ; the trumpet 's clang</l>
     <l n="202">Dies far away : the Apostle turned and prayed ,</l>
     <l n="203">With eyes upraised ; and now , for pealing trumps , 249</l>
     <l n="204">Heard in the wind the lessening sound of harps ,</l>
     <l n="205">Still lessening , and still lessening , till the cave</l>
     <l n="206">Was silent ; and the stirring winds without</l>
     <l n="207">Alone were heard , like sweet , sad melodies ,</l>
     <l n="208">Remembered in old times ; whilst he who stood</l>
     <l n="209">Beside him watched ; and after , as the day</l>
     <l n="210">Slowly declined , they two conversing sat ,</l>
     <l n="211">Conversing of God 's judgment — of the voice</l>
     <l n="212">Which said to man the sinner , Dust thou art ,</l>
     <l n="213">And unto dust thou shalt return — of death ,</l>
     <l n="214">And immortality through Christ restored ; 260</l>
     <l n="215">So they deceived the time , till John , oppressed</l>
     <l n="216">With sights and sounds so terrible , lay down ,</l>
     <l n="217">And sank to sleep , not to awake till dawn .</l>

     <l n="26">Of “ resurrection , ” and the world to come ,</l>
     <l n="27">He cried , King of the Jews , dost thou believe 50</l>
     <l n="28">The prophets ! Yes ! I know thou dost believe .</l>
     <l n="29">The king , with faltering voice , tremblingly cried ,</l>

     <l n="31">To be a Christian ! Paul , with lifted hand</l>
     <l n="32">And steadfast look , thus answered him , Almost !</l>
     <l n="33">Oh ! would that the whole world were not “ almost , ”</l>

     <l n="38">A poor old man , like Paul , a prisoner ,</l>

     <l n="43">Old age , and many sorrows ; yet even here</l>
     <l n="44">My soul hath been sustained by Him who said ,</l>
     <l n="45">Lo ! I am with you alway , and I know</l>
     <l n="46">He still is with me . I have heard his voice ,</l>
     <l n="47">And seen his look of glory and of love 70</l>

     <l n="55">These few gray hairs for thy green laurel crown —</l>
     <l n="56">This solitude , for living Caesar 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="57">Or Caesar 's subject world ! 80</l>
     <l n="58">The soldier turned</l>
     <l n="59">Disdainful , and his crest shook in the wind ;</l>
     <l n="60">Then , lifting high his ensign of command ,</l>
     <l n="61">He bade the trumpet sound the second watch .</l>
     <l n="62">John knelt , and prayed , Thy kingdom come , O Lord !</l>
     <l n="63">Then he who stood beside him , spoke unmoved :</l>
     <l n="64">Rome — Rome shall be no more ! At dead of night ,</l>
     <l n="65">Hark ! the barbarian trump ; Jerusalem</l>
     <l n="66">Shall be avenged ; and those of distant days ,</l>
     <l n="67">Pondering the fate of empires , there shall come 90</l>
     <l n="68">To muse upon the fragments of her might ,</l>
     <l n="69">Her ancient glory passed as morning clouds ,</l>
     <l n="70">And tremble for the judgments of the Lord</l>
     <l n="71">In all the world !</l>
     <l n="72">Now to the cave retire ,</l>
     <l n="73">For other visions of the things to come ,</l>
     <l n="74">And other fearful shadows , must thou see .</l>
     <l n="75">John sat , and held his hands upon his brow :</l>
     <l n="76">The earth seems to retire , and all the sounds</l>
     <l n="77">Of tumult and of woe at once to cease . 100</l>
     <l n="78">Then John was in the Spirit , and he saw</l>
     <l n="79">Seven angels , and , beneath , a sea of glass</l>
     <l n="80">Mingled with fire ; and on the sea of glass</l>
     <l n="81">Those who had gained , on earth , the victory 104</l>
     <l n="82">Over the beast , all standing on the sea</l>
     <l n="83">Of glass , and in their hands the harps of God ,</l>
     <l n="84">And thus they sung , Oh ! great and marvellous</l>
     <l n="85">Art thou , Almighty God , and just and true</l>
     <l n="86">Are all thy ways , thou King of saints ! Amen .</l>
     <l n="87">Now from the temple a loud voice was heard , 110</l>
     <l n="88">Which said to the seven angels , Go your ways ,</l>
     <l n="89">Pour out the vials of the wrath of God</l>
     <l n="90">Upon the earth .<span corresp="#note175" type="note_anchor">[ 175 ]</span>Then on the men which bore</l>
     <l n="91">The mark upon their foreheads of the beast ,</l>
     <l n="92">Or fell down to his image , noisome sores</l>
     <l n="93">And plague-spots fell .</l>
     <l n="94">The second angel poured</l>
     <l n="95">His vial on the sea , and it became</l>
     <l n="96">The blood of a dead man ; and every thing</l>
     <l n="97">Which had the breath of life died in the sea . 120</l>
     <l n="98">And the third angel poured his vial out</l>
     <l n="99">Upon the rivers , and fresh fountains clear ,</l>
     <l n="100">And they became red blood . And then John heard ,</l>
     <l n="101">In trance , the angels of the waters say ,</l>
     <l n="102">Righteous art thou , O Lord ! and righteously ,</l>
     <l n="103">O thou which art , and was , and which shall be ,</l>
     <l n="104">Thus hast thou judged , for they have shed the blood</l>
     <l n="105">Of prophets and of saints ! A voice replied ,</l>
     <l n="106">From out the altar , Even so , O Lord !</l>
     <l n="107">Almighty God , thy judgments are most true ! 130</l>
     <l n="108">And the fourth angel poured his vial out</l>
     <l n="109">Upon the sun , and power was given to him</l>
     <l n="110">To scorch men with the fire , and they blasphemed</l>
     <l n="111">The name of God , and still repented not ,</l>
     <l n="112">Looking with gnashing teeth upon the sun .</l>
     <l n="113">And the fifth angel poured his vial out</l>
     <l n="114">Upon the kingdom of the beast , and , lo ! 137</l>
     <l n="115">The kingdom of the beast at once was dark :</l>
     <l n="116">But men repented not — even while they gnawed</l>
     <l n="117">Their tongues for pain , blaspheming God in heaven .</l>
     <l n="118">And the sixth angel poured his vial out</l>
     <l n="119">Where the great river of Euphrates rolls ,</l>
     <l n="120">And it was quick dried up , and so became</l>
     <l n="121">A highway for the armies of the east ,</l>
     <l n="122">And for the kings of earth , and the whole world ,</l>
     <l n="123">Gathering to battle , on the dreadful day</l>
     <l n="124">Of the incensed Lord , into a place</l>
     <l n="125">Called “ Armageddon , ” in the Hebrew tongue .</l>
     <l n="126">And the seventh angel poured his vial out</l>
     <l n="127">Into the air , and a loud voice was heard 150</l>
     <l n="128">Out of the temple 's inmost shrine , which cried ,</l>
     <l n="129">All is fulfilled ! At once an earthquake shook</l>
     <l n="130">The ground , and lightnings , red and terrible ,</l>
     <l n="131">Flashed , and the thunders rolled along the sky ,</l>
     <l n="132">And strange and fearful voices in the air</l>
     <l n="133">Were heard , so dreadful was that storm . Aghast ,</l>
     <l n="134">The nations fell ; and the great Babylon</l>
     <l n="135">Came in remembrance before God , to pour</l>
     <l n="136">On her the fierceness of his wakened wrath .</l>
     <l n="137">And now John saw another angel fly 160</l>
     <l n="138">In clouds , and coming down with power from heaven</l>
     <l n="139">Unto the earth ; and all the earth beneath</l>
     <l n="140">Was lighted with his glory ; and he cried ,</l>
     <l n="141">With the loud voice of judgment , Babylon</l>
     <l n="142">The great is fallen ! And then another voice</l>
     <l n="143">Answered , Come out of her ! Hath she not said ,</l>
     <l n="144">I sit a queen , mighty as Ashtoreth ?</l>
     <l n="145">The kings of earth shall tremble when they see</l>
     <l n="146">The smoke of her great torment ; they shall stand</l>
     <l n="147">Afar off from her burning , and shall cry , 170</l>
     <l n="148">That mighty city , Babylon , alas ! 171</l>
     <l n="149">In one hour is her judgment come ! The voice</l>
     <l n="150">Of harpers and of trumpeters no more</l>
     <l n="151">Shall in her streets be heard : the blood of saints ,</l>
     <l n="152">Of prophets , and of martyrs , is avenged !</l>
     <l n="153">The cries are heard , the smoke is seen , no more .</l>
     <l n="154">And after this , John lifted up his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="155">And heard the voice of mighty companies ,</l>
     <l n="156">Which sang and shouted , Alleluia ! reign</l>
     <l n="157">For ever , Lord of lords and King of kings ! 180</l>
     <l n="158">Salvation , honour , glory , power , and praise ,</l>
     <l n="159">Be unto thee , O Lord ! for thou hast judged</l>
     <l n="160">With righteousness ! They , with acclaiming voice ,</l>

     <l n="169">Was called “ True and Faithful ; ” on his head</l>
     <l n="170">Were crowns on crowns , and underneath a name</l>
     <l n="171">Which no man knew , save he who bore that name .</l>
     <l n="172">His vesture was a robe of blood , and they</l>
     <l n="173">Who followed him proclaimed , The Word of God !</l>
     <l n="174">And all the heavenly armies followed him</l>
     <l n="175">On horses white like his ; and on his robe</l>
     <l n="176">Was written — King of kings and Lord of lords .</l>
     <l n="177">The pomp is passed , and now John raised his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="178">And saw an angel standing in the sun . 201</l>
     <l n="179">The angel in his watch looked down to earth ,</l>
     <l n="180">And all the armies of the earth came forth</l>
     <l n="181">To war with the bright chivalry of heaven , 204</l>
     <l n="182">And Him who sat on the white horse ! And , lo !</l>
     <l n="183">Before the mighty cherubims advanced</l>
     <l n="184">Michael , the great archangel , while a shout</l>
     <l n="185">Rang , that the sun in heaven might seem to stand</l>
     <l n="186">Still at a sound so terrible . Opposed</l>
     <l n="187">To the great armies of the living God , 210</l>
     <l n="188">Frown the Satanic host , far as the eye</l>
     <l n="189">Can reach ; and horses black as night ,</l>
     <l n="190">And spectre armies , led , in front , by Death ,</l>
     <l n="191">Appear , receding into farther depths</l>
     <l n="192">Of blackness ; while , anon , a dragon , scaled ,</l>
     <l n="193">Moves weltering onward . Michael , from the ranks</l>
     <l n="194">Of cherubim advancing , lifts on high</l>
     <l n="195">His mace , and full on the scaled dragon 's crest</l>
     <l n="196">Smites . At his feet the dragon lay , and , lo !</l>
     <l n="197">The sable phantom-horsemen at the sight 220</l>
     <l n="198">Are vanished . Raise the victor-song to Him</l>
     <l n="199">Who rides on the white horse , and to his God</l>
     <l n="200">In heaven , for the great dragon is cast down</l>
     <l n="201">Into the bottomless and burning lake !</l>
     <l n="202">Another angel , with white waving plume ,</l>
     <l n="203">Descends ; an iron chain is in his hand ,</l>
     <l n="204">And the dark key of destiny , which shuts</l>
     <l n="205">The bottomless abyss , from whence the smoke</l>
     <l n="206">Ascends — ascends , but not a groan is heard .</l>
     <l n="207">The ancient dragon is cast down , and bound — 230</l>
     <l n="208">Bound for a thousand years , in chains , and thrown ,</l>
     <l n="209">Howling , into that nethermost abyss ;</l>
     <l n="210">While mercy , equity , and peace , and truth ,</l>
     <l n="211">Like angel forms , visit the earth , and move ,</l>
     <l n="212">Radiant as light , among the sons of men ,</l>
     <l n="213">And only sounds are heard of harmonies ,</l>
     <l n="214">Such as in heaven are sung about the throne ,</l>
     <l n="215">O'er which , in dewy light , the rainbow bends . 238</l>
     <l n="216">The trump of bannered war , the sighs and groans</l>
     <l n="217">Of miserable slaves , that rise from earth ,</l>
     <l n="218">In one deep murmur , to high heaven , are ceased ;</l>
     <l n="219">For love and mercy walk among mankind ,</l>
     <l n="220">And so shall walk , till the last trump shall sound .</l>
     <l n="221">Now a new heaven and new earth appear ;</l>
     <l n="222">And , coming down from heaven , even as a bride</l>
     <l n="223">Adorned to meet her husband , John beheld</l>
     <l n="224">The City of the New Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="225">Glittering beyond the clouds ; and then he heard</l>
     <l n="226">A voice from a bright cloud , The Lord shall come</l>
     <l n="227">And dwell with men , and he shall be their God ; 250</l>
     <l n="228">And God shall wipe from every eye the tear ,</l>
     <l n="229">And death shall be no more !</l>
     <l n="230">John spread his hands ,</l>
     <l n="231">And cried , with eyes upraised to heaven , Oh ! stay ,</l>
     <l n="232">Visions of bliss ! I am bowed down with age ,</l>
     <l n="233">Forlorn on earth , and I have tarried long</l>
     <l n="234">Alone and sad . Oh ! come , Lord Jesus Christ !</l>
     <l n="235">A voice replied , Thou shalt be where he is !</l>
     <l n="236">Hark ! ‘ twas the billow beating on the rocks</l>
     <l n="237">Of melancholy Patmos , and John wept , 260</l>
     <l n="238">As , slowly fading , like a summer dream ,</l>
     <l n="239">He saw the towers , and gates , and palaces ,</l>
     <l n="240">Of New Jerusalem fade in the clouds</l>
     <l n="241">Of eve , which shot its gleaming pinnacles</l>
     <l n="242">Aloft in the pale sky , and flushed the track</l>
     <l n="243">Of the sun 's westering orb with crimson light .</l>
     <l n="244">As the sun sunk , the sound of trump and horn</l>
     <l n="245">Shrilled , and the old man , starting from his trance ,</l>
     <l n="246">Beheld below the cave the Roman troop ,</l>
     <l n="247">Stationed to guard the island criminals , 270</l>
     <l n="248">Wind slow , in martial file , with banners spread , 271</l>
     <l n="249">Returning to their tents .</l>
     <l n="250">Ah ! where are now</l>
     <l n="251">The temples of the New Jerusalem ,</l>
     <l n="252">Glittering amid the clouds of parting day ?</l>
     <l n="253">Gone , like the rack ; and Patmos ’ dreary isle</l>
     <l n="254">And melancholy caves return the sound</l>
     <l n="255">Of marching men , and the hoarse Roman trump .</l>
     <l n="256">The Apostle to the entrance of his cave ,</l>
     <l n="257">The last remaining light on his gray hairs , 280</l>
     <l n="258">Comes slowly forth , and rests upon his staff ,</l>
     <l n="259">When the rock-pigeon , at the trump disturbed ,</l>
     <l n="260">Flew to his withered hand . With plumed crest</l>
     <l n="261">Upon his brazen helmet , holding high</l>
     <l n="262">The ensign of command , an eagle borne</l>
     <l n="263">Before him , on a spear , the praefect leads</l>
     <l n="264">His legionary band ; and as aloft</l>
     <l n="265">The banners wave , and shields and corslets throw</l>
     <l n="266">Back a pale glimmer , mark a mournful train</l>
     <l n="267">Of fettered men move sullenly , with whom , 290</l>
     <l n="268">Thoughtful , and with his hands upon his breast ,</l>
     <l n="269">His eyes , at times , uplifted to the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="270">One , as a soldier worn with toil , but marked</l>
     <l n="271">With a stern sadness on his manly brow ,</l>
     <l n="272">Comes silently , a tear on his dark cheek .</l>
     <l n="273">Near him , a youth , wan and emaciate ,</l>
     <l n="274">Leans on a female , by his side , in bloom</l>
     <l n="275">Of youthful beauty ; while , at intervals ,</l>
     <l n="276">Whene'er the trumpet ceased to ring , is heard</l>
     <l n="277">The breath of muttering , and the clank of chains . 300</l>
     <l n="278">John sighed , and , turning to the stranger , said</l>
     <l n="279">( For both were at the entrance of the cave ):</l>
     <l n="280">Even to this desert spot in the lone waves ,</l>
     <l n="281">War , and the ensigns and the sounds of war , 304</l>
     <l n="282">Have reached .</l>
     <l n="283">His guest illustrious , with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="284">Answered : Yet this is the mere mimickry</l>
     <l n="285">Of that appalling spectacle , that fills</l>
     <l n="286">The world 's wide scene with havoc and with blood ;</l>
     <l n="287">The murmur of whose mighty coil goes up 310</l>
     <l n="288">Still to the ear of Heaven . So man , the worm ,</l>
     <l n="289">Preys on his fellow-worm . Turn from the earth ,</l>
     <l n="290">As gradual evening shades the sinking scene ,</l>
     <l n="291">And think upon its sins and strife no more .</l>
     <l n="292">Come , let us , on the stone , before the cave ,</l>
     <l n="293">For all above is still and glorious ,</l>
     <l n="294">Sit down , and watch the stars as they steal out ,</l>
     <l n="295">One after one , and garnish the pale cope</l>
     <l n="296">Of heaven . How bright the troops of Hesper shine ,</l>
     <l n="297">Above the shadow of yon farther rock , 320</l>
     <l n="298">Whose western side is lustrous ; for the moon ,</l>
     <l n="299">Ascending in her car of glory , casts</l>
     <l n="300">A meditative and a solemn light</l>
     <l n="301">From cape to cape ! Look ! there is Helice ,<span corresp="#note177" type="note_anchor">[ 177 ]</span></l>
     <l n="302">Watched by the Grecian traders of the deep —</l>
     <l n="303">How clear she shines to-night above the sea !</l>
     <l n="304">High in the zenith , here and there , apart ,</l>
     <l n="305">Some solitary stars , now scarce discerned ,</l>
     <l n="306">Seem to retire into the farthest space ,</l>
     <l n="307">As if to shun the prouder planet 's gaze , 330</l>
     <l n="308">Each in his watch , with never-blenching eye ,</l>
     <l n="309">Steadfast . Nor marvel , then the stranger said ,</l>
     <l n="310">When all the silent host of the blue sky</l>
     <l n="311">Appear so beautiful , Idolatry</l>
     <l n="312">Should deem them gods , and to the Sun and Moon ,</l>
     <l n="313">Bel and Astarte , pay the worship due 136</l>
     <l n="314">To the invisible , Almighty Lord ,</l>
     <l n="315">Who rules in heaven and earth .</l>
     <l n="316">Is there a God ?</l>
     <l n="317">Yes ! Nature cries aloud , There is a God ,</l>
     <l n="318">Visible in his works , and infinite</l>
     <l n="319">In power ! There is a God , and he is just !</l>
     <l n="320">There is a God , and he is merciful !</l>
     <l n="321">Yet might we rather say , there is no God ,</l>
     <l n="322">Than think , that to a being such as man</l>
     <l n="323">No revelation of bright hope was given :</l>
     <l n="324">That man , created in God 's image , placed</l>
     <l n="325">Amid this vast and unknown universe ,</l>
     <l n="326">To sojourn upon earth a few brief years</l>
     <l n="327">Of feverish life , should look , for the last time , 350</l>
     <l n="328">Hopeless , upon the setting sun , and die .</l>
     <l n="329">Oh ! better be the worm that feeds on him .</l>
     <l n="330">With lifted gaze , the last Apostle cried ,</l>
     <l n="331">Fervently cried , Oh ! yes , Lord Jesus Christ ,</l>
     <l n="332">Thou art the Christian 's hope ! but most of me —</l>
     <l n="333">Of me , whom thou hast visited , and cheered</l>
     <l n="334">Through life 's long pilgrimage ; of me , of me ,</l>
     <l n="335">In age and solitude ; I , too , shall live</l>
     <l n="336">When all the clouds of time are rolled away ,</l>
     <l n="337">For ever live in glory where thou art ! 360</l>
     <l n="338">Retiring to the cave , pausing , he turned</l>
     <l n="339">To his companion , but he was not there ;</l>
     <l n="340">The moon shone , but there was no form or shape</l>
     <l n="341">Of living thing ; so lonely to his cave ,</l>
     <l n="342">O'erwearied , John retired , there musing lay</l>
     <l n="343">On what he saw and heard , till sleep unawares</l>
     <l n="344">Oppressed him , and that night — that only night —</l>
     <l n="345">He had not fallen upon his knees , and prayed ,</l>
     <l n="346">Protect me through this night , O Lord my God !</l>
     <l n="347">When , suddenly , a hiss was heard without , 370</l>
     <l n="348">And the dull hurtle , as of iron wings ,</l>
     <l n="349">And short and intermitted flames , at times ,</l>
     <l n="350">Lighted the cavern roof ; then all again</l>
     <l n="351">Was dark , save when the moon dilated hung ,</l>
     <l n="352">And all again was still . John 's heavy eyes</l>
     <l n="353">Were closed ; and dreaming half , and half awake ,</l>
     <l n="354">He slumbered in the cavern . Who art thou ?</l>
     <l n="355">Starting , he cried , and trembled , for strange eyes</l>
     <l n="356">Glared through the dusk , and seemed to look at him .</l>
     <l n="357">It was the coinage of the aged brain , 380</l>
     <l n="358">When sadness and the sense of loneliness</l>
     <l n="359">Oppress the weary heart ! His eyes are closed</l>
     <l n="360">A moment , when strange voices , in the air ,</l>
     <l n="361">Syllable words unknown , as mocking him ,</l>
     <l n="362">Then all is hushed again : from the dark roof</l>
     <l n="363">Fantastic and deriding shapes , half seen ,</l>
     <l n="364">Point down long fingers , and a laugh is heard</l>
     <l n="365">From the dark fissure of the rocky cave ,</l>
     <l n="366">Till even his shadow , by a moon-glance seen ,</l>
     <l n="367">Seems joining the fantastic mockery . 390</l>
     <l n="368">Strange forms of beasts and birds , with monstrous beaks</l>
     <l n="369">Solemnly nodding , in the dusk appear .</l>
     <l n="370">Yonder , by moonlight , all with heads hung down ,</l>
     <l n="371">There moves a shrouded and a moping train ,</l>
     <l n="372">But not a form distinctly visible ,</l>
     <l n="373">Save of a corpse , that silently they bear ,</l>
     <l n="374">On which the moonlight falls . Now a dark cloud</l>
     <l n="375">Is interposed , and the dim troop dissolves .</l>
     <l n="376">Forthwith a spectre , towering to the skies ,</l>
     <l n="377">Moves onward — on , directly to the cave ; 400</l>
     <l n="378">And , towering higher as he moves , he lifts —</l>
     <l n="379">Half cloud and half anatomy — a dart ,</l>
     <l n="380">Barbed with fire , and a deep voice is heard ,</l>
     <l n="381">Through the involving clouds about his head : 404</l>
     <l n="382">I am Apollyon ; dost thou sleep , old man ?</l>
     <l n="383">Tremble — and die !</l>
     <l n="384">John raised his eyes , and prayed ,</l>
     <l n="385">Still shuddering , Save me , save me , Jesus Christ !</l>
     <l n="386">The spectre vanished : some faint lightning shone</l>
     <l n="387">At distance ; and now gentler forms drew nigh , 410</l>
     <l n="388">With airy minstrelsy of harps unseen ,</l>
     <l n="389">Surrounding him , like shadows of the blessed :</l>
     <l n="390">Here , radiant female forms came gliding by ;</l>
     <l n="391">There , in a stream of light , an angel turned</l>
     <l n="392">His look upon him , while soft voices sing :</l>

   <lg>
     <l n="1">John , gazing on the glimmering eastern surge ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sat with fixed eyes , when thus the stranger spake :</l>
     <l n="3">Up ! for the Word and Spirit of the Lord</l>
     <l n="4">Are come to me . Let us ascend , old man ,</l>
     <l n="5">The summit of Elijah 's cliff , that hangs</l>

     <l n="7">Rise o'er the AEgean solitude to-day .</l>
     <l n="8">John answered , Can these feeble limbs sustain</l>

     <l n="10">Step by step , when I feel my strength decay 10</l>
     <l n="11">Daily , and draw my breath with pain ?</l>

     <l n="25">Thoughtful and silent : soon they saw the sun</l>
     <l n="26">Slowly emerging , a vast orb of fire ,</l>
     <l n="27">Above the shadowy edge of ocean ; now</l>
     <l n="28">Flaming direct o'er Asia , with a stream 28</l>
     <l n="29">Of long illumination , on the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="30">Marked with confusion of rich hues , and thence</l>
     <l n="31">Touching the nearer promontory 's height ,</l>
     <l n="32">Pale cliffs , and eagles ’ wings above the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="33">And now careering through the heaven , supreme ,</l>
     <l n="34">Full and magnificent , in loneliness</l>
     <l n="35">Of glory . When the rays first touched his brow ,</l>
     <l n="36">Then more exalted , and of larger frame ,</l>
     <l n="37">The stranger seemed to grow , as not of earth ,</l>
     <l n="38">Or earth 's inhabitants ; so tall his form ,</l>
     <l n="39">So glorified his aspect . John had fallen</l>
     <l n="40">Upon his knees , but a mild voice rebuked : 40</l>
     <l n="41">See that thou do it not ; hast thou received</l>
     <l n="42">Or strength or comfort , give the thanks to God .</l>
     <l n="43">John , resting on the crag of the wild rock ,</l>
     <l n="44">Looked up , and then to his companion spoke :</l>
     <l n="45">Not uninstructive hath thy converse been ,</l>
     <l n="46">Nor unrefreshing to my weary heart</l>
     <l n="47">Thy presence ; more so , in a scene like this ,</l>
     <l n="48">Raised , as it were , above the shade and clouds</l>
     <l n="49">Of transient time . And so , long since , my soul</l>
     <l n="50">Felt a divine refreshment , when I stood 50</l>
     <l n="51">Upon the mount of vision with our Lord</l>
     <l n="52">That day when in transfigured form he rose .</l>
     <l n="53">Oh ! well do I remember it , who saw ,</l>
     <l n="54">With James and Peter , by the sight oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="55">The glorious apparition . Each stray cloud</l>
     <l n="56">Wandered far off , and lost in the blue sky ,</l>
     <l n="57">And not a freckle stained the firmament</l>
     <l n="58">High overhead . The mystic mount itself ,</l>
     <l n="59">Tabor , seemed rising up to heaven , and loomed</l>
     <l n="60">In such illumination , that the track 60</l>
     <l n="61">Below , and all the plains of Galilee ,</l>
     <l n="62">Rivers and lake to the great western sea , 62</l>
     <l n="63">Looked cold and dim , even in the morning sun ;</l>
     <l n="64">Such was the glory of the sudden blaze</l>
     <l n="65">That wrapped the mount . The crowd of lesser hills</l>
     <l n="66">On to the city of Tiberias ,</l>
     <l n="67">Appeared below o'er which the eagle sailed ,</l>
     <l n="68">Mute , for his eyes yet blenched from the excess</l>
     <l n="69">Of light , unlike the sun , that startled him ,</l>
     <l n="70">With bursting splendour , where he slept . He flew , 70</l>
     <l n="71">High soaring o'er the hills of Jezreel ,</l>
     <l n="72">On to the mountains of Samaria .</l>
     <l n="73">We fell upon the ground , and with our hands</l>
     <l n="74">Covered our faces , when we raised our eyes ,</l>
     <l n="75">We saw three glorified appearances ;</l>
     <l n="76">Two , as of aged prophets , with their beards</l>
     <l n="77">Streaming ; each held a book , and in the midst ,</l>
     <l n="78">And , buoyant in the air , his countenance</l>
     <l n="79">Bright as the sun , our Saviour 's form appeared</l>
     <l n="80">Above them , while his vest , intensely white , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Floated , as thus transfigured he arose .</l>
     <l n="82">With clasped hands , and eyes upraised to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="83">Peter , in joy and wonder , ardently</l>
     <l n="84">Cried : Let us build three tabernacles here ,</l>
     <l n="85">To Moses , and Elias , and to thee ,</l>
     <l n="86">Saviour and God ! not knowing what he said .</l>
     <l n="87">A cloud now interposed between the light ,</l>
     <l n="88">Softening its glory , while a voice was heard</l>
     <l n="89">From the bright cloud , Lo , my beloved Son —</l>
     <l n="90">Hear him ! At once the shadowy imagery , 90</l>
     <l n="91">The visionary pomp , the radiant cloud ,</l>
     <l n="92">Were rolled away , and Jesus stood alone ;</l>
     <l n="93">For they who held high converse , and whose forms ,</l>
     <l n="94">Appeared in thinner air , above the blaze ,</l>
     <l n="95">Were gone with the departing cloud : his hand</l>
     <l n="96">He placed upon our heads , and said , Fear not ! 96</l>
     <l n="97">And that calm look of dignity and love</l>
     <l n="98">Was placed upon us , as before . Again</l>
     <l n="99">We saw the sun — the cloudless cope of heaven —</l>
     <l n="100">The long green valley of Esdraelon — 100</l>
     <l n="101">The pines of dewy Hermon , and the smoke</l>
     <l n="102">Of Nain , where once a widowed mother wept</l>
     <l n="103">Her lost and only son , whom Jesus raised</l>
     <l n="104">From death 's cold sleep , restoring to her tears</l>
     <l n="105">Of joy ; we saw the cavern and the cliffs</l>
     <l n="106">Of Endor , where the wizard-woman called</l>
     <l n="107">Up from his sleep of death the prophet<span corresp="#note178" type="note_anchor">[ 178 ]</span>old ,</l>
     <l n="108">To tell to trembling Saul his hour was come .</l>
     <l n="109">Oh ! hills , and streams , and plains of Palestine ;</l>
     <l n="110">Scenes where we heard , long since , our Master 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="111">And saw his face ! how often , with a tear , 111</l>
     <l n="112">Have I remembered you , how often sighed :</l>
     <l n="113">Oh ! for the swiftness of an eagle 's wing ,</l>
     <l n="114">That I might flee away , and visit you</l>
     <l n="115">Once more ! But this great vision of the mount ,</l>
     <l n="116">With shadowings of glory , was displayed ,</l>
     <l n="117">That we might be sustained in the dread day</l>
     <l n="118">Of trial , when the very rocks should burst —</l>
     <l n="119">When , through deep darkness , the loud cry should come :</l>
     <l n="120">My God , my God , hast thou forsaken me ? 120</l>
     <l n="121">That we might be prepared , through every ill ,</l>
     <l n="122">In peril and in pain , in life , in death ;</l>
     <l n="123">Though persecution , famine , and the sword ,</l>
     <l n="124">Fronted our way , prepared to hold right on ;</l>
     <l n="125">Calm to take up our cross , and follow Him</l>
     <l n="126">Who meekly bowed his head upon that cross ;</l>
     <l n="127">For if in this life only we had hope ,</l>
     <l n="128">We were of all most miserable . Lord ,</l>
     <l n="129">Thee have I followed , now in age , and poor , 139</l>
     <l n="130">Thy sufferings were for us — for us ? for me ;</l>
     <l n="131">For me thy bleeding side was pierced , for me</l>
     <l n="132">Thy spirit groaned ! Oh ! come , Lord Jesus Christ !</l>
     <l n="133">Oh ! come , for I have tarried long on earth ;</l>
     <l n="134">Come , Lord and Saviour ! have I prayed in vain ?</l>
     <l n="135">Thou didst appear in glory on the mount ;</l>
     <l n="136">And thou hast come , even now , and cried , Fear not ,</l>
     <l n="137">I live for evermore , and have the keys</l>
     <l n="138">Of death and hell . And wherefore should I fear ,</l>
     <l n="139">Now waiting only to depart in peace !</l>
     <l n="140">But I have wandered in my thoughts ; this view 150</l>
     <l n="141">From this high mountain , and congenial thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="142">Have waked the memory of that vision bright ,</l>
     <l n="143">When once we saw , above the clouds of earth ,</l>
     <l n="144">Our Lord in glistening apparel shine .</l>
     <l n="145">Then he who stood upon the mountain 's van</l>
     <l n="146">With John , and gazed upon the seas below ,</l>
     <l n="147">Said , Look towards the East : what dost thou see ?</l>
     <l n="148">John answered , There is nothing but the clouds</l>

     <l n="1">Then the mysterious and majestic man</l>
     <l n="2">Thus spoke : Among the banished criminals ,</l>
     <l n="3">As they passed yesterday , didst thou not mark</l>
     <l n="4">A pale , emaciate youth , and by his side ,</l>
     <l n="5">Oft looking in his altered face , with tears ,</l>
     <l n="6">A beauteous Grecian female ! He was one 6</l>
     <l n="7">Who crowned his hair with roses ; trod the path</l>
     <l n="8">Of love and pleasure , till the vision fled .</l>
     <l n="9">And left him here , an outcast criminal ,</l>
     <l n="10">Soon , without hope , to sink into the grave ,</l>
     <l n="11">And leave his young companion desolate !</l>
     <l n="12">So ends a life of pleasure ! Woe for them ,</l>
     <l n="13">The young , the gay , the guilty , who rejoice</l>
     <l n="14">In life 's brief sunshine , then are swept away ,</l>

     <l n="17">With eyes that flashed beneath dishevelled hair ,</l>
     <l n="18">A female stood before them .</l>
     <l n="19">Look on me ,</l>
     <l n="20">She sighed , and spake : 20</l>
     <l n="21">No ! father , hear my prayer :</l>
     <l n="22">At Corinth I was born ; my mother died</l>

     <l n="27">At Tyre or Smyrna ; but the tempest rose ,</l>

     <l n="30">Escaped I know not how , for he was dead ; 30</l>

     <l n="37">And then it seemed still dearer , and I heard</l>

     <l n="54">Of summer , in the bloom and light of youth ,</l>
     <l n="55">Sang with accord of dulcet harmony ,</l>

     <l n="2">Interminable space of glorious light</l>
     <l n="3">Is spread , and angel-troops and hierarchies ,</l>
     <l n="4">With golden harps , half-seen , into the depths</l>
     <l n="5">Of that interminable light recede ,</l>

     <l n="21">As near , and still more near , she speeds her course , 170</l>

     <l n="80">With all his jubilant , acclaiming hosts ,</l>
     <l n="81">Amid the clouds !</l>
     <l n="82">The old man raised his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="83">And on his forehead placed his withered hand ,</l>
     <l n="84">A moment musing ; then he turned his look</l>
     <l n="85">Again to his companion at his side .</l>
     <l n="86">Ah ! he is gone ; but , hark ! a rustling sound</l>
     <l n="87">Is heard , and , bright above the eastern cliffs ,</l>

     <l n="89">Look ! he ascends into the azure depth</l>
     <l n="90">Of light ; he still ascends , till the blue sky</l>
     <l n="91">Is only interrupted by some clouds 240</l>
     <l n="92">Of lightest brede and beauty , o'er the sea</l>
     <l n="93">Transparent hung . John gazed with hands outspread ,</l>

     <l n="96">His withered hands extending as in prayer .</l>
     <l n="97">But , lo ! the vessel drops its sail ; a boat</l>
     <l n="98">Is hurrying , smooth and rapid , through the spray —</l>
     <l n="99">The sounds of men are heard — see , they approach !</l>
     <l n="100">Yes , they are messengers of peace ! they come</l>
     <l n="101">With tidings to the lonely habitant . 250</l>
     <l n="102">Two elders of the Church of Ephesus</l>
     <l n="103">Greet him with salutations from the ship</l>

     <l n="105">Beneath the rocks of Patmos : from the beach</l>
     <l n="106">The elders slow advanced , and one thus spoke :</l>

     <l n="109">Thy presence and thy guidance ; and , behold !</l>
     <l n="110">The bark now waits to bear thee o'er the deep ,</l>
     <l n="111">For Nerva has reversed the stern decree 200</l>
     <l n="112">Passed for thy banishment : arise , return ,</l>
     <l n="113">Return ; for now the light of heaven again</l>
     <l n="114">Gleams on the temple of our infant faith ;</l>
     <l n="115">The radiance of the “ golden candlestick , ”</l>
     <l n="116">That shone in the deep darkness of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="117">Shall flame more bright . Arise — arise — return !</l>
     <l n="118">John took their hands , and , blessing them , gave thanks</l>
     <l n="119">To God who rules above ; then cried , I go —</l>
     <l n="120">With many thronging thoughts — back to the world ,</l>
     <l n="121">To wait how Heaven may yet dispose my lot , 270</l>
     <l n="122">Till the grave close upon my pilgrimage .</l>
     <l n="123">Yet would I stay a while , to bid farewell</l>
     <l n="124">To that , my cave ,<span corresp="#note186" type="note_anchor">[ 186 ]</span>where I have seen strange things ,</l>
     <l n="125">And heard strange voices , and have passed five years</l>
     <l n="126">In loneliness and watching , and in prayer .</l>
     <l n="127">Let me not part till I have said farewell !</l>
     <l n="128">Hereafter I shall tell what I have seen .</l>
     <l n="129">But now , O Lord and Saviour ! strengthen me ,</l>
     <l n="130">A poor old man , returning to the world ;</l>
     <l n="131">Oh ! look and let me feel thy presence now , 280</l>
     <l n="132">Whom I have served so long I shall not see</l>
     <l n="133">Again thy glorious form upon the earth ,</l>
     <l n="134">But I have lived to see thy Church arise ,</l>
     <l n="135">Now in its infancy , and gathering power</l>
     <l n="136">From day to day ; and thou shalt be adored</l>
     <l n="137">Till the remotest isles , and every land ,</l>
     <l n="138">Shall praise and magnify thy glorious name !</l>
     <l n="139">My days are well-nigh told , and few remain ,</l>
     <l n="140">But I shall live , protected , to record ,</l>
     <l n="141">O Lord and Saviour ! all which I have seen , 290</l>
     <l n="142">High and mysterious ; as I declared ,</l>
     <l n="143">In the beginning was the Word ; the Word , 292</l>
     <l n="144">In the beginning , was with God ; the Word</l>
     <l n="145">Was God !</l>
     <l n="146">And now farewell ! Oh ! may I pass</l>
     <l n="147">What yet remains of life in faith and hope ,</l>
     <l n="148">Till Christ shall call me in his mercy hence ,</l>
     <l n="149">And lead me gently to my last repose .</l>
     <l n="150">Then may his Church , which he has raised on earth ,</l>
     <l n="151">Stand , though the tempest shake its battlements , 300</l>
     <l n="152">Stand , till the trumpet , the last trumpet sound ,</l>
     <l n="153">And He shall come in clouds who founded it !</l>
     <l n="154">As thus he spoke , his stature seemed to grow</l>
     <l n="155">More lofty , with a step more firm he trod ;</l>
     <l n="156">Whilst a mild radiance , lambent on his face ,</l>
     <l n="157">Shone , as the radiance from the mercy-seat .</l>
     <l n="158">He held his way , oft looking back to mark</l>
     <l n="159">The cave where he had lived , when , lo ! the dove ,</l>
     <l n="160">So often fed from his pale hand , has left</l>
     <l n="161">The cliff , and flies , faint-murmuring , round his hair . 310</l>
     <l n="162">And now he turns his eyes upon the deep ;</l>
     <l n="163">Yet scarce had reached the margin , when he saw</l>
     <l n="164">The sullen dwellers on these rugged shores ,</l>
     <l n="165">Led on by him who had confessed his sins —</l>
     <l n="166">The robber of Mount Carmel , in his chains —</l>
     <l n="167">Kneel at his feet . They blessed him , sorrowing</l>
     <l n="168">That they should see his face on earth no more .</l>
     <l n="169">The stern centurion hid a starting tear ;</l>
     <l n="170">The poor emaciate youth knelt down , and she</l>
     <l n="171">Who tended him with love and tenderness , 320</l>
     <l n="172">Wept , as he faintly sank , and breathed his last ,</l>
     <l n="173">His hands extending feebly , as he sunk ,</l>
     <l n="174">To John , in fervent prayer ! The Grecian girl</l>
     <l n="175">Fell , desolate and sobbing , on his breast .</l>
     <l n="176">But , lo ! the wind has veered , and , streaming out ,</l>
     <l n="177">The red cross pennant points to Asia , 326</l>
     <l n="178">As heaven-directed . Speed , ye mariners !</l>
     <l n="179">The sails are swelling , and the widening deep</l>
     <l n="180">Is all before you , surging to the gale .</l>
     <l n="181">So they kept on their course to Ephesus ,</l>
     <l n="182">And o'er the AEgean waves beheld , far off ,</l>
     <l n="183">The cave , the lonely sands and lessening capes</l>
     <l n="184">Of dreary Patmos sink to rise no more .</l>

    <head>WHITE HORSE , RED HORSE , BLACK HORSE , PALE HORSE .</head>
    <head>BLACK HORSE .— The period of the “ black horse and rider with the balance ” is generally referred to the reign of Severus . But here the commentators are at a loss . “ The balance ” sometimes betokens justice ; sometimes is considered as indicative of a season of scarcity . The “ black horse ” is always associated with calamity . I humbly differ from all commentators . The “ horse is black , ” say some , to show the “ severity of the nature ” of this emperor . But his nature was generally the reverse of severity . Now I shall give reasons for considering that “ the balance ” is the balance of Justice , and the “ bread for a penny , and oil and wine , ” indicative of plenty , not scarcity — of plenty owing entirely to the prudent provisions of this emperor ; and in proof of this , as well as what I shall say further on the subject , I adduce , not the testimony of professed Christian commentators , but the undesigned testimony — the stronger for that reason — of one of the most astute adversaries of Christianity — Gibbon .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Now , Christian reader , mark his undesigned corroboration of the</l>
     <l n="2">veracity of this prophecy , as applied to Severus .</l>

   <p>What says Gibbon ? “ Salutary laws were executed with inflexible firmness . ” “ In the administration of justice , the judgments of the emperor were characterised by attention , discernment , and impartiality ;<span corresp="#note187" type="note_anchor">[ 187 ]</span>and whenever he deviated from the strict line of equity , it was generally in favour of the poor and oppressed . ” — Gibbon .</p>
   <p>Scripture .— “ A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine . ”</p>
   <p>Gibbon .— “ He left in the public granaries a provision of corn for seven years , at the rate of 2500 quarters a day . ”</p>
   <p>But the “ black horse . ” Does this colour seem suitable to a period of general equity and justice ? How simple is one explanation , at least so it appears to me , the first , I believe , who ever remarked the circumstance , and how minutely does the singular fact tend to attest the awful truth of the prophecy — “ Severus was an African ! ” — Gibbon . And the “ horse is black , ” not as indicative of calamity , but of the country of which Severus was a native .</p>
   <p>The prophecy connected with the “ horses ” seems as regular as possible , beginning from the times of the Apostle . The white horse and rider is universally considered as emblematic of the gospel , going forth “ conquering and to conquer . ” The red horse is the horse of blood , under Trajan , who literally took “ peace from all the earth . ” The pale horse designates the famine and dreadful pestilence under Gallienus . I have shown , not from the writers in favour of Christianity , but from the attestation of the most astute and insidious writer against it , the regular succession and wonderful accordance , in the several successive periods , of the fact and the prophetic adumbrations . Under Gallienus , how remarkable are these words , as applicable to the “ pale horse , ” and pestilence , in the third century , commencing about one hundred and fifty years after the death of John ! “ Famine is almost always followed by epidemical diseases : other causes , however , must have contributed to the furious plague which , from the year 250 to the year 265 , raged , without interruption , in every province , every city , and almost every family of the Roman empire . Five thousand died daily in Rome ; and we might suspect , that war , pestilence , and famine had , in a few years , consumed the moiety of the human race . ” — Gibbon .</p>
   <p>THE RED HORSE .— “ Take peace from all the earth . ” Trajan 's conquests . “ Every day the astonished Senate received intelligence of new names and new nations that acknowledged his sway . The kings of Bosphorus , Colchis , Albania , &amp; c .; the tribes of the Median and Carducian hills had implored his protection ; Armenia , Mesopotamia , and Assyria were reduced to provinces . ” — Gibbon .</p>
   <p>For the elucidations of this last book , I have referred , generally , to commentators , chiefly Bishop Newton , though the reader may sometimes be disposed to smile rather than acquiesce .</p>
   <p>But I cannot omit my own views of some particular passages . One head of the beast , wounded , “ but not to death , ” is most singularly descriptive of the Roman empire , restored to strength and power , under Claudius the Second and Aurelius . “ And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion . ” How unexpectedly do they tally with what Gibbon says of the Roman empire at the time , consisting of the “ tyrants ” ( lions ) — “ soldiers , ” scattered through the vast and various provinces , and “ barbarians ” — Goths , indicated by the bear !</p>
   <p>I may observe , further , that the “ locusts and crawling things like scorpions , ” issuing out of the smoke , are , first , locusts — the innumerable northern armies ; secondly , “ crawling things like scorpions ” — the loathsome vileness attributed to nature by the succession of Gnostic sects , depraving the beautiful code of Christianity , and all agreeing in one doctrine , derived from the Chaldean philosophers . The Genius of Evil , according to the philosophy of the Chaldeans , produced the body , as Orosmades the soul ! Hence “ forbidding to marry , ” unnatural austerities , &amp; c .; and remark , one book of Tertullian to the Gnostics is called — what ? Scorpio .</p>

      <l n="1">Why art thou come , man of despair and blood !</l>
      <l n="2">To these green vales and streams , o'erhung with wood ;</l>
      <l n="3">These hills , where , far from life 's discordant throng ,</l>
      <l n="4">The lonely goat-maid chaunts her matin song ;</l>
      <l n="5">This sylvan glen , where age in peace reclines ,</l>
      <l n="6">Soothed by the whisper of his native pines ;</l>
      <l n="7">Where , in the twilight of his closing days ,</l>
      <l n="8">Upon the glimmering lake he loves to gaze ;</l>
      <l n="9">And , like his life , sees on the shadowy flood ,</l>
      <l n="10">The still , sweet eve descending ! Man of blood , 10</l>
      <l n="11">Break not his holy musings ! Innocence</l>
      <l n="12">And peace these vales inhabit . Hie thee hence</l>
      <l n="13">To the waste wilderness , the mournful main ,</l>
      <l n="14">To caves where silence and deep stillness reign ,</l>
      <l n="15">Where God 's eye only can the gloom pervade ;</l>
      <l n="16">And shroud thy visage in their dreariest shade !</l>
      <l n="17">Or , if these scenes , so beauteous , may impart</l>
      <l n="18">A momentary softness to thine heart ,</l>
      <l n="19">Let nature plead , plead for a guiltless land ,</l>
      <l n="20">Ere yet thou lift'st the desolating brand ; 20</l>
      <l n="21">Ere yet thou bidst the peaceful echoes swell 21</l>
      <l n="22">With havoc 's shouts and many a mingled yell !</l>
      <l n="23">Pause yet a moment ! By the beard</l>
      <l n="24">Of him whose eyes to heaven are reared ;</l>
      <l n="25">By her who frantic lifts her helpless hand ;</l>
      <l n="26">By those poor little ones , that speechless stand ;</l>
      <l n="27">If thou hast nature in thee , oh relent ,</l>
      <l n="28">Nor crush the lowly shed of virtue and content !</l>
      <l n="29">No golden shrines can tempt thy plunder here ,</l>
      <l n="30">No jealous castles their dark turrets rear . 30</l>
      <l n="31">Peeping at dawn among the mountain vines ,</l>
      <l n="32">The village pastor 's simple mansion shines</l>
      <l n="33">Beneath the tower , the music of whose bells</l>
      <l n="34">Soft o'er the azure lake each Sabbath swells .</l>
      <l n="35">No lighted halls that blaze till morn reply</l>
      <l n="36">To sounds of proud , voluptuous revelry ;</l>
      <l n="37">But one sweet pipe , by lingering lover played ,</l>
      <l n="38">Cheers the dim valley as the day-tints fade ;</l>
      <l n="39">Whilst , ‘ mid the rocks , the torrents , and the trees ,</l>
      <l n="40">Her little world , with pride , affection sees . 40</l>
      <l n="41">Survey the prospect well . Soldier ! dost thou</l>
      <l n="42">( Thy blood-red plumage waving o'er thy brow )</l>
      <l n="43">Bid the poor villagers , who in the shed</l>
      <l n="44">Of their forefathers eat their virtuous bread ,</l>
      <l n="45">To hard oppression bend the prostrate knee ,</l>
      <l n="46">Or learn benevolence and love from thee !</l>
      <l n="47">And dost thou talk of freedom ! Freedom here</l>
      <l n="48">Lifted with death-denouncing frown her spear ;</l>
      <l n="49">Here joining her loud voice 's solemn call</l>
      <l n="50">To the deep thunders of the waterfall , 50</l>
      <l n="51">She hailed her chosen home : these dark woods rang</l>
      <l n="52">As her bold war-song on the rocks she sang .</l>
      <l n="53">At once a thousand banners to the air</l>
      <l n="54">Streaming , a thousand falchions brandished bare ,</l>
      <l n="55">Proclaimed her sons ’ dread homage : We will die 55</l>
      <l n="56">Or live thy children , holiest Liberty !</l>
      <l n="57">Oh think of this ! Alas ! the voice is vain ;</l>
      <l n="58">Poor injured land , thy brave , thy blameless train ,</l>
      <l n="59">Thy lovely landscapes , bursting bright around ,</l>
      <l n="60">Thy gleam that echoed every cheering sound , 60</l>

      <l n="63">Then rise , insulted country ! in despair</l>
      <l n="64">Lift thy brave arm so terrible , and swear ,</l>
      <l n="65">Swear thou wilt never sheathe the avenging steel</l>
      <l n="66">Till thou hast made the fell invader feel</l>
      <l n="67">How vain the terrors of his glittering crest ,</l>
      <l n="68">How warm the flame that fires a patriot 's breast !</l>
      <l n="69">How nerved their arm , opposed to tenfold might , 69</l>
      <l n="70">Who for the dearest hopes , their homes , their offspring fight !</l>
      <l n="71">And , hark ! even now , methought stern Freedom called ,</l>
      <l n="72">From the wild shores of rocky Underwald !</l>
      <l n="73">Rush like the mountain avalanche on those</l>
      <l n="74">Who , foes to you , my sons , are Virtue 's foes !</l>
      <l n="75">Lo , where the legions of insulting France</l>
      <l n="76">Already on your ravaged plains advance ;</l>
      <l n="77">See your pale daughters , they for mercy plead ;</l>
      <l n="78">Behold your white-haired sires , they sink , they bleed !</l>
      <l n="79">Oh ! yet your patriot energies unite</l>
      <l n="80">To quell the insolent oppressor 's might ! 80</l>
      <l n="81">Behold the scene where your forefathers broke</l>
      <l n="82">And sternly trampled on the Austrian yoke !</l>
      <l n="83">Behold the spot where the undaunted band</l>
      <l n="84">First met , and , clasping each his brother 's hand ,</l>
      <l n="85">Bade the Almighty hear their solemn vow ,</l>
      <l n="86">That never should their injured country bow ,</l>
      <l n="87">A slave ! then lifted in the midnight air</l>
      <l n="88">Their spears , whilst the dun rocks echoed — We swear !</l>
      <l n="89">Think that the dead behold you ! He whose bow 89</l>
      <l n="90">Laid the grim tyrant of these valleys low ,</l>
      <l n="91">On yonder eminence yet seems to stand ;</l>
      <l n="92">To you he dimly wares his awful hand :</l>
      <l n="93">Go forth , my sons , in each bold bosom swell</l>
      <l n="94">The injured spirit of another Tell !</l>
      <l n="95">And rush , like yon huge avalanche , on those</l>
      <l n="96">Who , foes to you , are Freedom 's , Virtue 's foes !</l>
      <l n="97">So Freedom spake : she stood august and high ;</l>
      <l n="98">Like a pale meteor shone her troubled eye ;</l>
      <l n="99">She smote her shield , and , with indignant look ,</l>
      <l n="100">More awful her uplifted war-spear shook . 100</l>
      <l n="101">From many a wild and woodland solitude ,</l>
      <l n="102">O'erhung with snowy-silvered mountains rude ;</l>
      <l n="103">From glassy lakes , or where the brawling brook</l>
      <l n="104">Wells , sparkling , through some beech-embowered nook ;</l>
      <l n="105">From scattered chalets , decked with mantling vines ,</l>
      <l n="106">Above whose blue smoke wave the impending pines ;</l>
      <l n="107">From many a covert green , or gleaming rock ,</l>
      <l n="108">The bold defenders of their country flock !</l>
      <l n="109">Upon a cliff , that at gray morning throws</l>
      <l n="110">Its shadow o'er the deep clear lake 's repose , 110</l>
      <l n="111">Their gallant leader stands . Children , he cries ,</l>
      <l n="112">And one sad tear-drop gathers in his eyes ,</l>
      <l n="113">Their arms prevail ! Helvetia mourns in vain !</l>
      <l n="114">Bound by the ruthless victor 's galling chain ,</l>
      <l n="115">We only ‘ mid these rocky ramparts find</l>
      <l n="116">Brief shelter from the vultures of mankind ;</l>
      <l n="117">Hither they speed their desolating sway ,</l>
      <l n="118">They flap their bloody pinions o'er their prey ;</l>
      <l n="119">But we have hearts , my brethren , and we know</l>
      <l n="120">What to our country and our God we owe ; 120</l>
      <l n="121">And we have arms , arms that may make them rue</l>
      <l n="122">( Though rude our ramparts , our defenders few ) ,</l>
      <l n="123">The hour when they assailed this last retreat . 123</l>
      <l n="124">Feel we our hearts beat high , our pulses beat ?</l>
      <l n="125">Death calls us , yet , oh , lowly let us bend ,</l>
      <l n="126">And pray to Him who is the poor man 's friend ,</l>
      <l n="127">That he would guard our orphans when we bleed ,</l>
      <l n="128">And shield them in the bitter hour of need !</l>
      <l n="129">Now , soldier , let thy huge artillery roar ,</l>
      <l n="130">Thy marshalled columns flash along the shore , 130</l>
      <l n="131">Thy armed transports with long shadow ride</l>
      <l n="132">Terrific o'er the lake 's once tranquil tide ,</l>
      <l n="133">And thy loud trumpets bray , as in disdain</l>
      <l n="134">Of the poor tenants of the snowy plain .</l>
      <l n="135">They fear thee not , they are oppression 's foes ;</l>
      <l n="136">Unscared , thy march of carnage they oppose ;</l>
      <l n="137">Though their fallen brethren have in vain withstood ;</l>
      <l n="138">Though yet thy sword be red with their best blood ;</l>
      <l n="139">Thy sword , thy steeds , thy legions , they defy ,</l>
      <l n="140">And death is couched within their flashing eye ! 140</l>
      <l n="141">Age has new energies ; in traces weak</l>
      <l n="142">An angry hectic rises on his cheek ;</l>
      <l n="143">And as his time-touched features kindling glow ,</l>
      <l n="144">Lead me , he cries , yet lead me to the foe !</l>
      <l n="145">Stern manhood o'er his boy low murmuring bends ,</l>
      <l n="146">Then , as his deadly weapon he extends ,</l>
      <l n="147">Proudly exclaims , Freedom or death , my son !</l>
      <l n="148">And thou , O God of justice , lead us on !</l>
      <l n="149">Hark ! with one shout they rush into the fight ,</l>
      <l n="150">The pale foe shrinks before their gathering might ! 150</l>
      <l n="151">Fragments of rocks in wild despair they wield ,</l>
      <l n="152">And helms and shivered swords bestrew the field .</l>
      <l n="153">The frantic mother , hushing every grief ,</l>
      <l n="154">Joins the dread scene , and to some plumed chief</l>
      <l n="155">All pale with rage , with desperation wild ,</l>
      <l n="156">Cries , as she smites his heart : Hadst thou a child !</l>
      <l n="157">Unequal strife ! the scene of death is o'er ; 157</l>
      <l n="158">Mother and child lie side by side in gore !</l>
      <l n="159">When evening comes , through the lone cottage pane ,</l>
      <l n="160">No light looks cheerful in the darkening plain ,</l>
      <l n="161">No soothing sounds stray the dim hills along ,</l>
      <l n="162">No home-returning goat-herd trills the song ;</l>
      <l n="163">At intervals , wild accents of despair ,</l>
      <l n="164">Or shouts are heard , or dismal nightfires glare ;</l>
      <l n="165">But all is dark and silent near yon heap</l>
      <l n="166">Where the fallen heroes of the hamlet sleep ;</l>
      <l n="167">Save that , at times , a hollow groan is heard ,</l>
      <l n="168">Or melancholy cry of the night-bird ;</l>
      <l n="169">Save where some dog , amid the scene of death ,</l>
      <l n="170">Moans as he watches yet his master 's breath ; 170</l>
      <l n="171">Whilst with despair and love that seems to speak ,</l>
      <l n="172">He licks the blood that stagnates on his cheek .</l>
      <l n="173">The morn looks through the hurrying clouds , the air</l>
      <l n="174">Sighs as it lifts , at times , the dead man 's hair ;</l>
      <l n="175">Upon those slaughtered heaps the cold stars shine ,</l>
      <l n="176">And Freedom sighs : The triumph , Gaul , is thine !</l>
      <l n="177">Now dawns the morn o'er vales with blood defiled ,</l>
      <l n="178">Where late affection 's sweetest pictures smiled .</l>
      <l n="179">O'er the still lake how sadly peals the bell</l>
      <l n="180">That sounds of every earthly hope the knell ! 180</l>
      <l n="181">Pale on the crimsoned snow , without a home ,</l>
      <l n="182">The sad survivors of that death-storm roam ;</l>
      <l n="183">Their infants , outcast on the desert plain ,</l>
      <l n="184">Demand their mothers and their sires in vain ;</l>
      <l n="185">And when the red sun leaves the darkening sky ,</l>
      <l n="186">Amid those gory tracks sit down and sigh .</l>
      <l n="187">Shores of Lucerne ! where many a winding bay</l>
      <l n="188">Shone beauteous to the morn 's returning ray ;</l>
      <l n="189">Where rosy tints upon the blue lake shone ,</l>
      <l n="190">And touched the rock with colours not their own ; 190</l>
      <l n="191">Who now , with eyes that swim in tenderness , 191</l>
      <l n="192">Those scenes to every virtue dear shall bless !</l>
      <l n="193">What pleasure now can the rich landscape yield ,</l>
      <l n="194">The sparkling cataract , the pendent field ,</l>
      <l n="195">‘ Mid hoar declivities , the sunny tower</l>
      <l n="196">Peering o'er beeches that its roof embower ,</l>
      <l n="197">And cottage tops with light smoke trailing slow</l>
      <l n="198">O'er the gray vapours looming far below !</l>
      <l n="199">Who shall ascend proud Pilate 's<span corresp="#note189" type="note_anchor">[ 189 ]</span>height , and mark</l>
      <l n="200">The motley clouds sail o'er the champagne dark , 200</l>
      <l n="201">Now breaking in fantastic forms , and now</l>
      <l n="202">Dappling the distant promontory 's brow ?</l>
      <l n="203">Then when the sun , that lights the scene , rides high ,</l>
      <l n="204">And far away the scattered volumes fly ,</l>
      <l n="205">Look up to the great God that rules the world ,</l>
      <l n="206">By whom proud empires from their seats are hurled ,</l>
      <l n="207">And feel a glow of holy gratitude ,</l>
      <l n="208">That here , ‘ mid hollow glens and mountains rude ,</l>
      <l n="209">Far from Ambition 's march and Discord 's yell ,</l>
      <l n="210">Content with Love and Happiness should dwell . 210</l>
      <l n="211">Who now along those banks shall , listening , stray</l>
      <l n="212">When evening lights each inlet west away ,</l>
      <l n="213">And hear the solitary boatman 's oar</l>
      <l n="214">Dip duly as he nears the shaded shore ;</l>
      <l n="215">Or catch the whispers of the waterfall</l>
      <l n="216">That through the ivied clefts swell musical ?</l>
      <l n="217">These scenes , these sounds , could many a joy impart ,</l>
      <l n="218">With sadness mixed . The wandering youth , whose heart</l>
      <l n="219">Was sick with many sorrows , resting here</l>
      <l n="220">At such an hour , forgot his starting tear ; 220</l>
      <l n="221">He felt a pensive calm , sweeter than sleep ,</l>
      <l n="222">Steal gently o'er his aching breast ; the deep</l>
      <l n="223">And clear repose of the unruffled lake 223</l>
      <l n="224">His spirit seemed , unconscious , to partake ;</l>
      <l n="225">And still the water , as it whispered near ,</l>
      <l n="226">Or high woods , as they rustled , soothed his ear ,</l>
      <l n="227">Like the remembrance of a melody</l>
      <l n="228">Heard in his infant , happy years gone by .</l>
      <l n="229">Now in his distant country , when , with tears ,</l>
      <l n="230">The tale of ruffian violence he hears ; 230</l>
      <l n="231">Hears that the spot which smiled with lovely gleam ,</l>
      <l n="232">Like some sweet image of a tender dream ,</l>
      <l n="233">Upon his morning path , is drenched with gore ,</l>
      <l n="234">Its harmless tenants weltering on the shore ;</l>
      <l n="235">He will exclaim , whilst from his breast he draws</l>
      <l n="236">A deep , deep sigh , Avenge , O God , their cause !</l>
      <l n="237">Who would not sigh for Switzerland ! What heart</l>
      <l n="238">That ever bore in human woes a part ;</l>
      <l n="239">That ever felt affection 's genuine flame ;</l>
      <l n="240">That ever leaped at injured Freedom 's name ; 240</l>
      <l n="241">Would not for her dark foes feel honest hate ,</l>
      <l n="242">And swell with indignation at her fate !</l>
      <l n="243">If thus her lot of sorrow have impressed</l>
      <l n="244">Grief and resentment on a stranger 's breast ,</l>
      <l n="245">How must he hear the cruel tale of death ,</l>
      <l n="246">He who in these sad vales first drew his breath !</l>
      <l n="247">‘ Tis his perhaps in distant climes to roam ,</l>
      <l n="248">Far from the shelter of his early home ;</l>
      <l n="249">Yet still , as fancy paints the spot , he sees</l>
      <l n="250">His father 's cottage , and the mountain trees ; 250</l>
      <l n="251">Again by the wild streams he seems to rove ;</l>
      <l n="252">He hears the voice of her who won his love ,</l>
      <l n="253">His heart 's first love ; for her he prunes the vine ,</l>
      <l n="254">Whose clustering leaves the rustic porch entwine ;</l>
      <l n="255">The mountain 's van together they ascend ;</l>
      <l n="256">They see Alps piled on Alps far on extend ;</l>
      <l n="257">They mark the casual sunshine light the mass , 257</l>
      <l n="258">Or vernal showers along the valley pass ;</l>
      <l n="259">Whilst tinging the dark rocks , more lovely glow</l>
      <l n="260">The braided colours of heaven 's humid bow .</l>
      <l n="261">But now the maid he loved , with whom all day</l>
      <l n="262">He used in summer o'er the hills to stray ,</l>
      <l n="263">The faithful maid he loved — oh ! cold despair ,</l>
      <l n="264">Freeze his warm life-blood ; and that thrilling air ,</l>
      <l n="265">Which erst he sang , when , all alive to joy ,</l>
      <l n="266">He carolled on the Alps , a shepherd boy ,</l>
      <l n="267">Let him not hear it now , lest tears quick start ,</l>
      <l n="268">And madness harrow up his broken heart !</l>
      <l n="269">How touching was the simple strain ! The tear</l>
      <l n="270">Of memory started when it met the ear ; 270</l>
      <l n="271">And he whose front was rough with many a scar ,</l>
      <l n="272">Whose bold heart bounded at the trump of war ,</l>
      <l n="273">Stood all dissolved in sadness at its tone ,</l>
      <l n="274">Remembering him of pleasant seasons gone .</l>
      <l n="275">Perhaps full many a heavy hour had passed ,</l>
      <l n="276">Since in its native nooks he heard it last ;</l>
      <l n="277">And when again its well-known music thrilled ,</l>
      <l n="278">A thousand thronging recollections filled</l>
      <l n="279">His soul , that , sick with longing , homeward roved ;</l>
      <l n="280">Remote from scenes which most on earth he loved , 280</l>
      <l n="281">Cast on a world tempestuous , bleak , and wide ,</l>
      <l n="282">More ardent for his once-loved hills he sighed ;</l>
      <l n="283">And sighed again to think how it might fare</l>
      <l n="284">With sisters , brothers , friends , and parents there ;</l>
      <l n="285">For be its music and its name forgot ,</l>
      <l n="286">The desert is his home , and those he loved are not !</l>

     <lg type="stanza" n="2">
      <l n="287">I was a child of sorrow when I passed ,</l>
      <l n="288">Sweet country , through your rocky valleys last ;</l>
      <l n="289">For one whom I had loved , whom I had pressed</l>
      <l n="290">With honest , ardent passion to my breast ,</l>
      <l n="291">Was to another vowed : I heard the tale ,</l>
      <l n="292">And to the earth sank heartless , faint , and pale .</l>
      <l n="293">Till that sad hour when every hope had flown ,</l>
      <l n="294">I thought she lived for me , and me alone ;</l>
      <l n="295">Yet did I not , though pangs my heart must rend ,</l>
      <l n="296">Prove to thy weakness a sustaining friend ? 10</l>
      <l n="297">Did I not bid thee , never , never more</l>
      <l n="298">Or think of me or mine ? As firm I swore</l>
      <l n="299">To cast away the dream , and bury deep ,</l>
      <l n="300">As in oblivion of the dead man 's sleep ,</l>
      <l n="301">All that once soothed , and from the soul to tear</l>
      <l n="302">Each longing wish that youth had cherished there .</l>
      <l n="303">But when ‘ twas midnight , to the woods I hied ,</l>
      <l n="304">Despairing , and with frantic anguish cried :</l>
      <l n="305">Oh , had relentless death with instant dart</l>
      <l n="306">Smitten and snatched thee from my bleeding heart ; 20</l>
      <l n="307">Through life had niggard fortune bid us pine ,</l>
      <l n="308">And withered with despair thy hopes and mine ;</l>
      <l n="309">Yes , yes , I could have borne it ; but to see</l>
      <l n="310">The accusing tear , and know it falls for me ;</l>
      <l n="311">Oh cease the thought — a long and last farewell —</l>
      <l n="312">We must forget — nor shall my soul rebel !</l>
      <l n="313">Then to my country 's cliffs I bade adieu ,</l>
      <l n="314">And what my sad heart felt God only knew .</l>
      <l n="315">Helvetia , thy rude scenes , a drooping guest ,</l>
      <l n="316">I sought , and sorrowing sought a spot of rest . 30</l>
      <l n="317">Through many a mountain pass and shaggy vale 31</l>
      <l n="318">I roamed an exile , passion-crazed and pale .</l>
      <l n="319">I saw your clouded heights sublime impend ,</l>
      <l n="320">I heard your foaming cataracts descend ;</l>
      <l n="321">And oft the rugged scene my heart endued</l>
      <l n="322">With a strange , sad , distempered fortitude ;</l>
      <l n="323">Oft on the lake 's green marge I lay reclined ,</l>
      <l n="324">Murmuring my moody fancies to the wind ;</l>
      <l n="325">But when some hanging hamlet I surveyed ,</l>
      <l n="326">A wood-cot peeping in the sheltered glade , 40</l>
      <l n="327">A tear , perforce , would steal ; and , as my eye</l>
      <l n="328">Fondly reverted to the days gone by ,</l>
      <l n="329">How blest , I cried , remote from every care ,</l>
      <l n="330">To rest with her we loved , forgotten there !</l>
      <l n="331">Then soft , methought , from the sequestered grove ,</l>

      <l n="349">All dark the torrent of their fate hath rushed ; 63</l>

      <l n="366">The beautiful , the brave , the young , the old ! 80</l>
      <l n="367">No voice is heard that charmed their earthly road :</l>

      <l n="369">The blast that swept them to the earth yet raves ,</l>
      <l n="370">And strews with havoc their insulted graves .</l>
      <l n="371">As on the lucid lake 's unruffled breast</l>

      <l n="405">Far from the earthly scenes that wasteful lie ,</l>
      <l n="406">Virtue and peace , and arts and freedom fly ; 120</l>
      <l n="407">Arts which the wild surrounding views inspired ,</l>

      <l n="431">Strong shouts and clangours through the high wood run ,</l>
      <l n="432">And distant arms flash to the sinking sun ;</l>
      <l n="433">Dark forests their lone empire , the tall rocks</l>
      <l n="434">Their shelter , and their wealth their wandering flocks .</l>
      <l n="435">To the proud Macedon , whose conquering car</l>
      <l n="436">Rolled terrible through the ranks of armed war ; 150</l>
      <l n="437">Whose banners chilled the plain with fearful shade ;</l>
      <l n="438">Whose sovereignty a thousand trumpets brayed ,</l>
      <l n="439">The Scythian chiefs spoke nobly : What have we ,</l>

      <l n="441">Far o'er the snowy solitudes we roam ,</l>

      <l n="446">Hence , hence , and leave us to our forests free ! 160</l>
      <l n="447">But the stern soldier , with war 's banners spread ,</l>
      <l n="448">Through thy still vales his glittering squadrons led ;</l>
      <l n="449">And wild despair , and unrelenting hate . 163</l>
      <l n="450">Stalk o'er thine inmost valleys desolate ;</l>
      <l n="451">And she , that like the nimble mountain roe ,</l>

      <l n="453">She whose green buskins swept the frosts of morn ,</l>
      <l n="454">Who walked the high wood with her bugle horn ;</l>
      <l n="455">She who once called these hills her own , and found</l>
      <l n="456">Her loveliest sojourn ‘ mid the hallowed ground , 170</l>
      <l n="457">Blessing the spot where , shaded with high wood ,</l>

      <l n="461">On weltering carcases it seems to stand ,</l>
      <l n="462">Waving a dim-seen dagger in its hand ;</l>
      <l n="463">Its look is unrelenting as the grave ,</l>
      <l n="464">Around its brow the muttering whirlwinds rave ;</l>
      <l n="465">Its spreading shadow chills the scene beneath ,</l>
      <l n="466">Ah ! fly — it onward moves , and murmurs , Death ! 180</l>
      <l n="467">Earth fades beneath its footstep , and around</l>
      <l n="468">Long sighs and distant dying shrieks resound !<span corresp="#note190" type="note_anchor">[ 190 ]</span></l>

      <l n="471">Of this false phantom which the heart misled ;</l>
      <l n="472">That spoke of peace , peace to the poor man 's shed ,</l>
      <l n="473">Then left him , houseless , to the tempest 's gloom</l>
      <l n="474">That swept his hopes and comforts to the tomb !</l>
      <l n="475">High towered the grisly spectre , half concealed ,</l>
      <l n="476">And gathering clouds its dismal forests veiled ; 190</l>
      <l n="477">The clouds disperse , and lo ! ‘ mid murderous bands ,</l>

      <l n="481">The orgies peal , the banners wave on high , 195</l>
      <l n="482">And dark rocks ring to shouts of liberty !</l>
      <l n="483">Now , soldier , lift thy loud acclaiming voice !</l>
      <l n="484">Children of high-souled sentiment , rejoice !</l>
      <l n="485">Round the scathed tree , upon the desert plain ,</l>

   <p>THE</p>
   <p>VILLAGER 'S VERSE-BOOK .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>The following compositions were written originally to be learned by heart by poor children of my own parish , who have been instructed every Sunday through the summer , on the garden lawn before the parsonage house , by Mrs Bowles . The object , which , to the best of my knowledge , is entirely novel , was briefly to describe the most obvious images in country life , familiar to every child ; and in the smallest compass to connect every distinct picture with the earliest feelings of humanity and piety , in language which the simplest might understand ; but which , from the objects represented , might be read , perhaps , with some interest by those whose minds were more cultivated . About fourteen of these little poems were composed with this view many years ago ; but it was not thought of extending their knowledge beyond the village circle , to which they were originally limited , except by a very few copies given away . I have now added to the number , and revised the whole ; thinking that , when early education is so greatly extended , they may be found upon a wider scale to answer the purpose for which they were written . They may also prove acceptable to mothers in a higher station of life , who might wish to impress upon the memory of their children as they grow up , a love of natural scenes , combined with the earliest feelings of sympathy and religion . Some of these verses , such as “ The Mower , ” “ The Swan , ” etc ., are purposely designed for the exercise of a more advanced intellect .</p>

    <head>AN APOLOGUE .</head>
     <l n="1">The swallows , at the close of day ,</l>
     <l n="2">When autumn shone with fainter ray ,</l>
     <l n="3">Around the chimney circling flew ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ere yet they bade a long adieu ,</l>
     <l n="5">To climes where soon the winter drear</l>
     <l n="6">Shall close the unrejoicing year .</l>
     <l n="7">Now with swift wing they skim aloof ,</l>
     <l n="8">Now settle on the crowded roof ,</l>
     <l n="9">As counsel and advice to take ,</l>
     <l n="10">Ere they the chilly north forsake .</l>
     <l n="11">Then one , disdainful , turned his eye ,</l>
     <l n="12">Upon a red-breast twittering nigh ,</l>
     <l n="13">And thus began , with taunting scorn :</l>
     <l n="14">Thou household imp , obscure , forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="15">Through the deep winter 's dreary day ,</l>
     <l n="16">Here , dull and shivering , shalt thou stay ;</l>
     <l n="17">Whilst we , who make the world our home ,</l>
     <l n="18">To softer climes impatient roam ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where summer , still on some green isle</l>
     <l n="20">Rests , with her sweet and lovely smile ?</l>
     <l n="21">Thus speeding , far and far away ,</l>
     <l n="22">We leave behind the shortening day .</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Tis true ( the red-breast answered , meek )</l>
     <l n="24">No other scenes I ask , or seek ;</l>
     <l n="25">To every change alike resigned ,</l>
     <l n="26">I fear not the cold winter 's wind .</l>
     <l n="27">When spring returns , the circling year</l>
     <l n="28">Shall find me still contented here ;</l>
     <l n="29">But whilst my warm affections rest</l>
     <l n="30">Within the circle of my nest ,</l>
     <l n="31">I learn to pity those that roam ,</l>
     <l n="32">And love the more my humble home .</l>

     <l n="2">In summer sunshine , or in winter 's rain ,</l>
     <l n="3">Duly as tolls the bell , to the high fane</l>
     <l n="4">Explores , with faltering footsteps , his dark way ,</l>

     <l n="6">The chaunted service , pealing full and clear .</l>
     <l n="7">Ask why alone in the same spot he kneels</l>
     <l n="8">Through the long year . Oh , the wide world is cold ,</l>
     <l n="9">As dark , to him ! Here he no longer feels</l>
     <l n="10">His sad bereavement . Faith and Hope uphold</l>

     <l n="12">Amid the unpitying tumult of his mind .</l>
     <l n="13">As through the aisles the choral anthems roll ,</l>
     <l n="14">His soul is in the choirs above the skies ,</l>
     <l n="15">And songs far off of angel companies ,</l>

   <p>A DRAMATIC SKETCH .</p>
   <p>In this wise the Duke of Gloucester took upon himself the order and governance of the young King , whom , with much honour and humble reverence , he conveyed towards London . But the tidings of this matter came hastily to the Queen , a little before the midnight following ; and that , in secret wise , her son was taken , her brother and other friends arrested , and sent no man wist whither , to be done with God wot what . With which tidings the Queen , with great heaviness , bewailed her child 's reign , her friend 's mischance , and her own misfortune , damning the time that ever she dissuaded the gathering of powers about the King ; got herself , in all haste possible , with her young son and her daughter , out of the palace of Westminster , in which they then lay , into the Sanctuary ; lodging herself and company there in the Abbott 's place .— Speed 's “ History of England , ” book ix .</p>

     <l n="5">When thousands listened to the prelate<span corresp="#note214" type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span>there ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who called on God , with consecrating prayer ;—</l>
     <l n="7">I saw a village-maid , almost a child , 7</l>
     <l n="8">Even as a light-haired cherub , undefiled</l>
     <l n="9">From earth 's rank fume , with innocent look , her eye</l>
     <l n="10">Meekly uplifted to the throne on high ,</l>
     <l n="11">Join in the full choir 's solemn harmony .</l>
     <l n="12">Oh , then , how many boding thoughts arose ,</l>

     <l n="14">Those looks of modesty , that open truth</l>
     <l n="15">Lighting the forehead of ingenuous youth —</l>
     <l n="16">Lest these , as slowly steal maturing years ,</l>
     <l n="17">Should fade , and grief succeed , and dimming tears ;</l>
     <l n="18">Then should the cheek be blanched with early care ,</l>
     <l n="19">Sin mark its first and furrowing traces there ,</l>
     <l n="20">With touch corroding mar the altered mien , 20</l>
     <l n="21">And leave a canker where the rose had been ;</l>
     <l n="22">Then the sweet child , whose smiles can now impart</l>
     <l n="23">Joy overpowering to a mother 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="24">Might bring down , when not anxious love could save ,</l>
     <l n="25">That mother 's few gray hairs with sorrow to the grave !</l>
     <l n="26">But , hark ! the preacher 's voice , his accents bland ,</l>
     <l n="27">Behold his kindled look , his lifted hand ;</l>
     <l n="28">What holy fervour wakes at his command !</l>
     <l n="29">He speaks of faith , of mercy from above ,</l>
     <l n="30">Of heavenly hope , of a Redeemer 's love ! 30</l>
     <l n="31">Hence every thought , but that which shows fair youth</l>
     <l n="32">Advancing in the paths of peace and truth !</l>
     <l n="33">Which shows thy light , O pure religion ! shed ,</l>
     <l n="34">Like a faint glory , on a daughter 's head ,</l>

     <l n="39">He , with white locks , and long-descending beard ,</l>
     <l n="40">A patriarch of other years appeared : 40</l>
     <l n="41">And thine , O aged , solitary man ! 41</l>
     <l n="42">Was life 's enchanted way , when life began ,</l>
     <l n="43">The sunshine on each mountain , and the strain</l>
     <l n="44">Of some sweet melody , in every plain ;</l>
     <l n="45">Thine was illusive fortune 's transient gleam ,</l>
     <l n="46">And young love 's broken , but delicious dream ;</l>
     <l n="47">Those mocking visions of thy youth are flown ,</l>
     <l n="48">And thou dost bend on death 's dark brink alone</l>
     <l n="49">The light associates of thy vernal day , 49</l>
     <l n="50">Where are they ? Blown , like the sere leaves , away ;</l>
     <l n="51">And thou dost seem a trunk , on whose bare head</l>
     <l n="52">The gray moss of uncounted days is spread !</l>
     <l n="53">I know thee not , old man ! yet traits like these ,</l>

     <l n="55">Another , or another year , for thee ,</l>
     <l n="56">Haply , “ the silver cord shall loosed be ! ”</l>
     <l n="57">Then listen , whilst warm eloquence portrays</l>
     <l n="58">That “ better country ” to thy anxious gaze ,</l>
     <l n="59">Who art a weary , way-worn “ pilgrim here , ”</l>
     <l n="60">And soon from life 's vain masque to disappear . 60</l>
     <l n="61">O aged man ! lift up thine eyes — behold</l>
     <l n="62">What brighter views of distant light unfold ;</l>
     <l n="63">What though the loss of strength thou dost deplore ,</l>
     <l n="64">Or broken loves , or friends that are no more ?</l>
     <l n="65">What though gay youth no more his song renews ,</l>
     <l n="66">And summer-light dies , like the rainbow hues ?</l>
     <l n="67">The Christian hails the ray that cheers the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="68">And throws its heavenly halo round the tomb .</l>
     <l n="69">Who bade the grave its mouldering vault unclose ?</l>
     <l n="70">“ Christ — Christ who died ; yea , rather , Christ who rose ! ”</l>
     <l n="71">Hope lifts from earth her tear-illumined eye , 71</l>
     <l n="72">She sees , dispersed , the world 's last tempest fly ;</l>
     <l n="73">Sees death , arrested ‘ mid his havoc vast ,</l>
     <l n="74">Lord , at thy feet his broken weapons cast !</l>
     <l n="75">In circles , far retiring from the sight , 75</l>
     <l n="76">Till , undistinguished , they are lost in light ,</l>
     <l n="77">Admiring seraphim suspend their wings ,</l>
     <l n="78">Whilst , hark ! the eternal empyrean rings ,</l>
     <l n="79">Hosannah , Lord of lords , and King of kings !</l>
     <l n="80">Such thoughts arose , when from the crowded fane 80</l>
     <l n="81">I saw retire the mute , assembled train ;</l>
     <l n="82">Their images beguiled my homeward way ,</l>
     <l n="83">Which high o'er Lansdowne 's lonely summit lay .</l>
     <l n="84">There seemed a music in the evening gale ,</l>
     <l n="85">And looking back on the long-spreading vale ,</l>
     <l n="86">Methought a blessing waited on the hour ,</l>
     <l n="87">As the last light from heaven shone on the distant tower .</l>
