    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">During the decade between 1879 and 1889 I was engaged in a detailed study of Wordsworth ; and , amongst other things , edited a library edition of his Poetical Works in eight volumes , including the “ Prefaces ” and “ Appendices ” to his Poems , and a few others of his Prose Works , such as his ‘ Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England ’ . This edition was published by Mr. Paterson , Edinburgh , at intervals between the years 1882 and 1886 : and it was followed in 1889 by a ‘ Life of Wordsworth ’ , in three volumes , which was a continuation of the previous eight .</p>
    <p n="2">The present edition is not a reproduction of those eleven volumes of 1882-9 . It is true that to much of the editorial material included in the latter — as well as in my ‘ Memorials of Coleorton ’ , and in ‘ The English Lake District as interpreted in the Poems of Wordsworth ’ — I can add little that is new ; but the whole of what was included in these books has been revised , corrected , and readjusted in this one<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>. ‘ Errata ’ in the previous volumes are corrected : several thousand new notes have been added , many of the old ones are entirely recast : the changes of text , introduced by Wordsworth into the successive editions of his Poems , have all been revised ; new readings — derived from many MS. sources — have been added : while the chronological order of the Poems has , in several instances , been changed , in the light of fresh evidence .</p>
    <p n="3">The distinctive features of my edition of 1882-6 were stated in the Preface to its first volume . So far as these features remain in the present edition , they may be repeated as follows :</p>
    <p n="4">FIRST , the Poems are arranged in chronological order of composition , not of publication . In all the collective editions issued by Wordsworth during his lifetime , the arrangement of his poems in artificial groups , based on their leading characteristics — a plan first adopted in 1815 — was adhered to ; although he not unfrequently transferred a poem from one group to another . Here they are printed , with one or two exceptions to be afterwards explained , in the order in which they were written .</p>
    <p n="5">SECOND , the changes of text made by Wordsworth in the successive editions of his Poems , are given in footnotes , with the dates of the changes .</p>
    <p n="6">THIRD , suggested changes , written by the Poet on a copy of the stereotyped edition of 1836-7 — long kept at Rydal Mount , and bought , after Mrs. Wordsworth 's death , at the sale of a portion of the Library at the Mount — are given in footnotes .</p>
    <p n="7">FOURTH , the Notes dictated by Wordsworth to Miss Isabella Fenwick — a dear friend of the Rydal Mount household , and a woman of remarkable character and faculty — which tell the story of his Poems , and the circumstances under which each was written , are printed in full .</p>
    <p n="8">FIFTH , Topographical Notes — explanatory of allusions made by Wordsworth to localities in the Lake District of England , to places in Scotland , Somersetshire , Yorkshire , the Isle of Man , and others on the Continent of Europe — are given , either at the close of the Poem in which the allusions occur , or as footnotes to the passages they illustrate .</p>
    <p n="9">SIXTH , several complete Poems , and other fragments of verse , not included in any edition of his Works published during Wordsworth 's lifetime , or since , are printed as an appendix to Volume VIII .</p>
    <p n="10">SEVENTH , a new Bibliography of the Poems and Prose Works , and of the several editions issued in England and America , from 1793 to 1850 , is added .</p>
    <p n="11">EIGHTH , a new Life of the Poet is given .</p>
    <p n="12">These features of the edition of 1882-6 are preserved in that of 1896 , and the following are added :</p>
    <p n="13">FIRST , The volumes are published , not in library 8vo size , but — as the works of every poet should be issued — in one more convenient to handle , and to carry . Eight volumes are devoted to the Poetical Works , and among them are included those fragments by his sister Dorothy , and others , which Wordsworth published in his lifetime among his own Poems . They are printed in the chronological order of composition , so far as that is known .</p>
    <p n="14">SECOND , In the case of each Poem , any Note written by Wordsworth himself , as explanatory of it , comes first , and has the initials W. W ., with the date of its first insertion placed after it . Next follows the Fenwick Note , within square brackets , thus [ ] , and signed I. F .; and , afterwards , any editorial note required . When , however , Wordsworth 's own notes were placed at the end of the Poems , or at the foot of the page , his plan is adopted , and the date appended . I should have been glad , had it been possible — the editors of the twentieth century may note this — to print Wordsworth 's own notes , the Fenwick notes , and the Editor 's in different type , and in type of a decreasing size ; but the idea occurred to me too late , i. e. after the first volume had been passed for press .</p>
    <p n="15">THIRD , All the Prose Works of Wordsworth are given in full , and follow the Poems , in two volumes . The Prose Works were collected by Dr. Grosart , and published in 1876 . Extracts from them have since been edited by myself and others : but they will now be issued , like the Poems , in chronological order , under their own titles , and with such notes as seem desirable .</p>
    <p n="16">FOURTH , All the Journals written by Dorothy Wordsworth at Alfoxden , Dove Cottage , and elsewhere , as well as her record of Tours with her brother in Scotland , on the Continent , etc ., are published — some of them in full , others only in part . An explanation of why any Journal is curtailed will be found in the editorial note preceding it . Much new material will be found in these Journals .</p>

   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>FIFTH , The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth — with a few from Mary and Dora Wordsworth — are arranged chronologically , and published by themselves . Hitherto , these letters have been scattered in many quarters — in the late Bishop of Lincoln 's ‘ Memoirs ’ of his uncle , in ‘ The Diary , Reminiscences , and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson ’ , in the ‘ Memorials of Coleorton ’ and my own ‘ Life ’ of the Poet , in the ‘ Prose Works ’ , in the ‘ Transactions of the Wordsworth Society ’ , in the ‘ Letters of Charles Lamb ’ , in the ‘ Memorials of Thomas De Quincey ’ , and other volumes ; but many more , both of Wordsworth 's and his sister 's , have never before seen the light . More than a hundred and fifty letters from Dorothy Wordsworth to Mrs. Clarkson , the wife of the great “ slave-liberator , ” were sent to me some time ago by Mrs. Arthur Tennyson , a relative of Mrs. Clarkson ; and I have recently seen and been allowed to copy , Wordsworth 's letters to his early friend Francis Wrangham , through the kindness of their late owner , Mr. Mackay of The Grange , Trowbridge . Many other letters of great interest have recently reached me .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>SIXTH , In addition to a new Bibliography , and a Chronological Table of the Poems , and the Prose Works , a Bibliography of Wordsworth Criticism is appended . It includes most of the articles on the Poet , and notices of his Works , which have appeared in Great Britain , America , and the Continent of Europe . Under this head I have specially to thank Mrs. Henry A. St. John of Ithaca , N. Y ., a devoted Transatlantic Wordsworthian , who has perhaps done more than any one — since Henry Reed — to promote the study of her favourite poet in America . Mrs. St. John 's Wordsworth collection is unique , and her knowledge and enthusiasm are as great as her industry has been . Professor E. Legouis of the University of Lyons — who wrote an interesting book on Wordsworth 's friend , ‘ Le Général Michel Beaupuy ’ ( 1891 ) — has sent me material from France , which will be found in its proper place . Frau Professor Gothein of Bonn , who has translated many of Wordsworth 's poems into German , and written his life , ‘ William Wordsworth : sein Leben , seine Werke , seine Zeitgenossen ’ , ( 1893 ) , has similarly helped me in reference to German criticism .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>SEVENTH , As the Poet 's Letters , and his sister 's Journals , will appear in earlier volumes , the new ‘ Life of Wordsworth ’ will be much shorter than that which was published in<date>1889</date>, in three volumes 8vo . It will not exceed a single volume . EIGHTH , In the edition of<date>1882-6</date>, each volume contained an etching of a locality associated with Wordsworth . The drawings were made by John M'Whirter , R. A ., in water-colour ; and they were afterwards etched by Mr. C. O. Murray . One portrait by Haydon was prefixed to the first volume of the ‘ Life ’ . In each volume of this edition — Poems , Prose Works , Journals , Letters , and Life — there will be a new portrait , either of the poet , or his wife , or sister , or daughter ; and also a small vignette of a place associated with , or memorialised by Wordsworth in some way . The following will be the arrangement . Vol . PORTRAITS / VIGNETTES THE POEMS . I. W. Wordsworth , by W. Shuter . Cockermouth . II . " " by Robert Hancock . Dame Tyson 's Cottage , Hawkshead . III .

" " by Thomas Woolner . Peele Castle . THE LIFE . XVI . " " by Frederick Thrupp . Grasmere Church and Churchyard . " " by Samuel Laurence . " " by Benjamin R. Haydon . All the etchings will be prepared by H. Manesse . The portraits , with many others , will be described in detail in a subsequent volume . In all editorial notes the titles given by Wordsworth to his Poems are invariably printed in italics , not with inverted commas before and after , as Wordsworth himself so often printed them : and when he gave no title to a poem , its first line will be invariably placed within inverted commas . This plan of using Italics , and not Roman letters , applies also to the title of any book referred to by Wordsworth , or by his sister in her Journals . Whether they put the title in italics , or within commas , it is always italicised in this edition . A subsidiary matter such as this becomes important when one finds that many editors of parts of the Works of Wordsworth , or of Selections from them , have invented titles of their own ; and have sent their volumes to press without the slightest indication to their readers that the titles were not Wordsworth 's ; mixing up their own notion of what best described the contents of the Poem , or the Letter , with those of the writer . Some have suppressed Wordsworth 's , and put their own title in its place ! Others have contented themselves ( more modestly ) with inventing a title when Wordsworth gave none . I do not object to these titles in themselves . Several , such as those by Archbishop Trench , are suggestive and valuable . What I object to is that any editor — no matter who — should mingle his own titles with those of the Poet , and give no indication to the reader as to which is which . Dr. Grosart has been so devoted a student of Wordsworth , and we owe him so much , that one regrets to find in “ The Prose Works of Wordsworth ” (<date>1876</date>) the following title given to his letter to the Bishop of Llandaff , ‘ Apology for the French Revolution ’ . It is interesting to know that Dr. Grosart thought this a useful description of the letter : but a clear indication should have been given that it was not Wordsworth 's . It is true that , in the general preface to his volumes , Dr. Grosart takes upon himself the responsibility for this title ; but it should not have been printed as the title in chief , or as the headline to the text . Similarly , with the titles of the second and third of the three ‘ Essays on Epitaphs ’ . As students of Wordsworth know , he issued a volume in<date>1838</date>containing all his sonnets then written ; and , at the close of that edition , he added , “ The six Sonnets annexed were composed as this Volume was going through the Press , but too late for insertion in the class of miscellaneous ones to which they belong . ” In<date>1884</date>, Archbishop Trench edited the sonnets , with an admirable introductory “ Essay on the History of the English Sonnet ” ; but , while Wordsworth gave no title to the 3rd and the 4th of the six , “ composed as the Volume was going through the Press , ” — either in his edition of<date>1838</date>, ‘ or in any subsequent issue ’ of his Poems — his editor did so . He gave what are really excellent titles , but he does not tell us that they are his own ! He calls them respectively ‘ The Thrush at Twilight ’ , and ‘ The Thrush at Dawn ’ . Possibly Wordsworth would have approved of both of those titles : but , that they are not his , should have been indicated .</docImprint>
    <docDate>I do not think it wise , from an editorial point of view , even to print in a “ Chronological Table ” — as Professor Dowden has done , in his admirable Aldine edition — titles which were not Wordsworth 's , without some indication to that effect . But , in the case of Selections from Wordsworth — such as those of Mr. Hawes Turner , and Mr. A. J. Symington ,— every one must feel that the editor should have informed his readers ‘ when ’ the title was Wordsworth 's , and ‘ when ’ it was his own coinage . In the case of a much greater man — and one of Wordsworth 's most illustrious successors in the great hierarchy of English poesy , Matthew Arnold — it may be asked why should he have put ‘ Margaret , or the Ruined Cottage ’ , as the title of a poem written in<date>1795-7</date>, when Wordsworth never once published it under that name ? It was an extract from the first book of ‘ The Excursion ’ — written , it is true , in these early years ,— but only issued as part of the latter poem , first published in<date>1814</date>. The question of the number , the character , and the length of the Notes , which a wise editor should append to the works of a great poet , ( or to any classic ) , is perhaps still ‘ sub judice ’ . My own opinion is that , in all editorial work , the notes should be illustrative rather than critical ; and that they should only bring out those points , which the ordinary reader of the text would not readily understand , if the poems were not annotated . For this reason , topographical , historical , and antiquarian notes are almost essential . The Notes which Wordsworth himself wrote to his Poems , are of unequal length and merit . It was perhaps necessary for him to write — at all events it is easy to understand , and to sympathise with , his writing — the long note on the revered parson of the Duddon Valley , the Rev . Robert Walker , who will be remembered for many generations as the “ Wonderful Walker . ” The Poet 's editors have also been occasionally led to add digressive notes , to clear up points which had been left by himself either dubious , or obscure . I must plead guilty to the charge of doing so : e. g . the identification of “ The Muccawiss ” ( see ‘ The Excursion ’ , book iii . l. 953 ) with the Whip-poor-Will involved a great deal of laborious correspondence years ago . It was a question of real difficulty ; and , although the result reached could now be put into two or three lines , I have thought it desirable that the opinions of those who wrote about it , and helped toward the solution , should be recorded . What I print is only a small part of the correspondence that took place . On the other hand , it would be quite out of place , in a note to the famous passage in the 4th book of ‘ The Excursion ’ , beginning ... I have seen A curious child applying to his ear to enter on a discussion as to the extent of Wordsworth 's debt — if any — to the author of ‘ Gebir ’ . It is quite sufficient to print the relative passage from Landor 's poem at the foot of the page . All the Notes written by Wordsworth himself in his numerous editions will be found in this one , with the date of their first appearance added . Slight textual changes , however , or casual ‘ addenda ’ , are not indicated , unless they are sufficiently important . Changes in the text of notes have not the same importance to posterity , as changes in the text of poems . In the preface to the Prose Works , reference will be made to Wordsworth 's alterations of his text . At present I refer only to his own notes to his Poems . When they were written as footnotes to the page , they remain footnotes still . When they were placed by him as prefaces to his Poems , they retain that place in this edition ; but when they were appendix notes — as e. g . in the early editions of “ Lyrical Ballads ” — they are now made footnotes to the Poems they illustrate . In such a case , however , as the elaborate note to ‘ The Excursion ’ , containing a reprint of the ‘ Essay upon Epitaphs ’ — originally contributed to “ The Friend ” — it is transferred to the Prose Works , to which it belongs by priority of date ; and , as it would be inexpedient to print it twice over , it is omitted from the notes to ‘ The Excursion ’ . As to the place which Notes to a poet 's works should occupy , there is no doubt that numerous and lengthy ones — however valuable , or even necessary , by way of illustration ,— disfigure the printed page ; and some prefer that they should be thrown all together at the end of each volume , or at the close of a series ; such as — in Wordsworth 's case — “ The River Duddon , ” “ Ecclesiastical Sonnets , ” ‘ The Prelude ’ , ‘ The White Doe of Rylstone ’ , etc . I do not think , however , that many care to turn repeatedly to the close of a series of poems , or the end of a volume , to find an explanatory note , helped only by an index number , and when perhaps even that does not meet his eye at the foot of the page . I do not find that even ardent Wordsworth students like to search for notes in “ appendices ” ; and perhaps the more ardent they are the less desirable is it for them thus “ to hunt the waterfalls . ” I have the greatest admiration for the work which Professor Dowden has done in his edition of Wordsworth ; but the ‘ plan ’ which he has followed , in his Aldine edition , of giving not only the Fenwick Notes , but all the changes of text introduced by Wordsworth into his successive editions , in additional editorial notes at the end of each volume — to understand which the reader must turn the pages repeatedly , from text to note and note to text , forwards and backwards , at times distractingly — is for practical purposes almost unworkable . The reader who examines Notes ‘ critically ’ is ever “ one among a thousand , ” even if they are printed at the foot of the page , and meet the eye readily . If they are consigned to the realm of ‘ addenda ’ they will be read by very few , and studied by fewer .</docDate>
    <docImprint>To those who object to Notes being “ thrust into view ” ( as it must be admitted that they are in this edition ) — because it disturbs the pleasure of the reader who cares for the poetry of Wordsworth , and for the poetry alone — I may ask how many persons have read the Fenwick Notes , given together in a series , and mixed up heterogeneously with Wordsworth 's own Notes to his poems , in comparison with those who have read and enjoyed them in the editions of<date>1857</date>and<date>1863</date>? Professor Dowden justifies his plan of relegating the Fenwick and other notes to the end of each volume of his edition , on the ground that students of the Poet ‘ must ’ take the trouble of hunting to and fro for such things . I greatly doubt if many who have read and profited — for they could not but profit — by a perusal of Professor Dowden 's work , ‘ have ’ taken that trouble , or that future readers of the Aldine edition will take it . To refer , somewhat more in detail , to the features of this edition . FIRST . As to the ‘ Chronological Order ’ of the Poems . The chief advantage of a chronological arrangement of the Works of any author — and especially of a poet who himself adopted a different plan — is that it shows us , as nothing else can do , the growth of his own mind , the progressive development of his genius and imaginative power . By such a redistribution of what he wrote we can trace the rise , the culmination , and also — it may be — the decline and fall of his genius . Wordsworth 's own arrangement — first adopted in the edition of<date>1815</date>— was designed by him , with the view of bringing together , in separate classes , those Poems which referred to the same ( or similar ) subjects , or which were supposed to be the product of the same ( or a similar ) faculty , irrespective of the date of composition . Thus one group was entitled “ Poems of the Fancy , ” another “ Poems of the Imagination , ” a third “ Poems proceeding from Sentiment and Reflection , ” a fourth “ Epitaphs and Elegiac Pieces , ” again “ Poems on the Naming of Places , ” “ Memorials of Tours , ” “ Ecclesiastical Sonnets , ” “ Miscellaneous Sonnets , ” etc . The principle which guided him in this was obvious enough . It was , in some respects , a most natural arrangement ; and , in now adopting a chronological order , the groups , which he constructed with so much care , are broken up . Probably every author would attach more importance to a classification of his Works , which brought them together under appropriate headings , irrespective of date , than to a method of arrangement which exhibited the growth of his own mind ; and it may be taken for granted that posterity would not think highly of any author who attached special value to this latter element . None the less posterity may wish to trace the gradual development of genius , in the imaginative writers of the past , by the help of such a subsequent rearrangement of their Works . There are difficulties , however , in the way of such a rearrangement , some of which , in Wordsworth 's case , cannot be entirely surmounted . In the case of itinerary Sonnets , referring to the same subject , the dismemberment of a series — carefully arranged by their author — seems to be specially unnatural . But Wordsworth himself sanctioned the principle . If there was a fitness in collecting all his sonnets in one volume in the year<date>1838</date>, out of deference to the wishes of his friends , in order that these poems might be “ brought under the eye at once ” — thus removing them from their original places , in his collected works — it seems equally fitting now to rearrange them chronologically , as far as it is possible to do so . It will be seen that it is not always possible . Then , there is the case of two Poems following each other , in Wordsworth 's own arrangement , by natural affinity ; such as the ‘ Epistle to Sir George Beaumont ’ , written in<date>1811</date>, which in almost all existing editions is followed by the Poem written in<date>1841</date>, and entitled , ‘ Upon perusing the foregoing Epistle thirty years after its composition ’ ; or , the dedication to ‘ The White Doe of Rylstone ’ , written in April<date>1815</date>, while the Poem itself was written in<date>1807</date>. To separate these Poems seems unnatural ; and , as it would be inadmissible to print the second of the two twice over — once as a sequel to the first poem , and again in its chronological place — adherence to the latter plan has its obvious disadvantage in the case of these poems . Mr. Aubrey de Vere is very desirous that I should arrange all the “ Poems dedicated to National Independence and Liberty ” together in series , as Wordsworth left them , “ on the principle that , though the order of publication should as a rule be the order of composition in poetry , all rules require , as well as admit of , exceptions . ” As I have the greatest respect for the judgment of such an authority as Mr. de Vere , I may explain that I only venture to differ from him because there are seventy-four Poems — including the sonnets and odes — in this series , and because they cover a period ranging from<date>1802</date>to<date>1815</date>. I am glad , however , that many of these sonnets can be printed together , especially the earlier ones of<date>1802</date>. After carefully weighing every consideration , it has seemed to me desirable to adopt the chronological arrangement in this particular edition ; in which an attempt is made to trace the growth of Wordsworth 's genius , as it is unfolded in his successive works . His own arrangement of his Poems will always possess a special interest and value ; and it is not likely ever to be entirely superseded in subsequent issues of his Works . The editors and publishers of the future may possibly prefer it to the plan now adopted , and it will commend itself to many readers from the mere fact that ‘ it was Wordsworth 's own ’ ; but in an edition such as the present — which is meant to supply material for the study of the Poet to those who may not possess , or have access to , the earlier and rarer editions — no method of arrangement can be so good as the chronological one . Its importance will be obvious after several volumes are published , when the point referred to above — viz . the evolution of the poet 's genius — will be shown by the very sequence of the subjects chosen , and their method of treatment from year to year . The date of the composition of Wordsworth 's Poems cannot always be ascertained with accuracy : and to get at the chronological order , it is not sufficient to take up his earlier volumes , and thereafter to note the additions made in subsequent ones . We now know ( approximately ) when each poem was first published ; although , in some instances , they appeared in newspapers and magazines , and in many cases publication was long after the date of composition . For example , ‘ Guilt and Sorrow ; or , Incidents upon Salisbury Plain ’ — written in the years<date>1791-94</date>— was not published ‘ in extenso ’ till<date>1842</date>. The tragedy of ‘ The Borderers ’ , composed in<date>1795-96</date>, was also first published in<date>1842</date>. ‘ The Prelude ’ — “ commenced in the beginning of the year<date>1799</date>, and completed in the summer of<date>1805</date>” — was published posthumously in<date>1850</date>: and some unpublished poems — both “ of early and late years ” — were first issued in<date>1886</date>. A poem was frequently kept back , from some doubt as to its worth , or from a wish to alter and amend it . Of the five or six hundred sonnets that he wrote , Wordsworth said “ Most of them were frequently re-touched ; and , not a few , laboriously . ” Some poems were almost entirely recast ; and occasionally fugitive verses were withheld from publication for a time , because it was hoped that they would subsequently form part of a larger whole . In the case of many of the poems , we are left to conjecture the date of composition , although we are seldom without some clue to it . The Fenwick Notes are a great assistance in determining the chronology . These notes — which will be afterwards more fully referred to — were dictated by Wordsworth to Miss Fenwick in the year<date>1843</date>; but , at that time , his memory could not be absolutely trusted as to dates ; and in some instances we know it to have been at fault . For example , he said of ‘ The Old Cumberland Beggar ’ that it was “ written at Racedown and Alfoxden in my twenty-third year . ” Now , he went to Racedown in the autumn of<date>1795</date>, when he was twenty-five years old ; and to Alfoxden , in the autumn of<date>1797</date>, when twenty-seven . Again , the poem ‘ Rural Architecture ’ is put down in the Fenwick note as “ written at Townend in<date>1801</date>” ; but it had been published in<date>1800</date>, in the second edition of “ Lyrical Ballads . ” Similarly Wordsworth gave the dates “<date>1801</date>or<date>1802</date>” for ‘ The Reverie of Poor Susan ’ , which had also appeared in “ Lyrical Ballads , ”<date>1800</date>. Wordsworth 's memory was not always to be trusted even when he was speaking of a group of his own Poems . For example , in the edition of<date>1807</date>, there is a short series described thus , “ Poems , composed during a tour , chiefly on foot . ” They are numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . Now , one would naturally suppose that all the poems , in this set of five , were composed during the same pedestrian tour , and that they all referred to the same time . But the series contains ‘ Alice Fell ’ (<date>1802</date>) , ‘ Beggars ’ (<date>1802</date>) , ‘ To a Sky-Lark ’ (<date>1805</date>) , and ‘ Resolution and Independence ’ (<date>1802</date>) . Much more valuable than the Fenwick notes — for a certain portion of Wordsworth 's life — is his sister Dorothy 's Journal . The mistakes in the former can frequently be corrected from the minutely kept diary of those early years , when the brother and sister lived together at Grasmere . The whole of that Journal , so far as it is desirable to print it for posterity , will be given in a subsequent volume . Long before the publication of the Fenwick notes , Wordsworth himself supplied some data for a chronological arrangement of his Works . In the table of contents , prefixed to the first collected edition of<date>1815</date>, in two volumes ,— and also to the second collected edition of<date>1820</date>, in four volumes ,— there are two parallel columns : one giving the date of composition , and the other that of publication . There are numerous blanks in the former column , which was the only important one ; as the year of publication could be ascertained from the editions themselves . Sometimes the date is given vaguely ; as in the case of the “ Sonnets dedicated to Liberty , ” where the note runs , “ from the year<date>1807</date>to<date>1813</date>. ” At other times , the entry of the year of publication is inaccurate ; for example , the ‘ Inscription for the spot where the Hermitage stood on St. Herbert 's Island , Derwentwater ’ , is put down as belonging to the year<date>1807</date>; but this poem does not occur in the volumes of<date>1807</date>, but in the second volume of “ Lyrical Ballads ” (<date>1800</date>) . It will thus be seen that it is only by comparing Wordsworth 's own lists of the years to which his Poems belong , with the contents of the several editions of his Works , with the Fenwick Notes , and with his sister 's Journal , that we can approximately reconstruct the true chronology . To these sources of information must be added the internal evidence of the Poems themselves , incidental references in letters to friends , and stray hints gathered from various quarters .</docImprint>

     <p>Many new sources of information as to the date of the composition of the Poems became known to me during the publication of my previous edition , and after its issue ; the most important being the Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth . These discoveries showed that my chronological table of 1882 — although then , relatively , “ up to date ” — was incomplete . The tables constructed by Mr. Tutin and by Professor Dowden are both more accurate than it was . It is impossible to attain to finality in such a matter ; and several facts , afterwards discovered , and mentioned in the later volumes of my previous edition , have been used against the conclusions come to in the earlier ones . I have thus supplied the feathers for a few subsequent critical arrows . The shots have not been unkindly ones ; and I am glad of the result , viz . that our knowledge of the dates — both as to the composition and first publication of the poems — is now much more exact than before . When a conjectural one is given in this edition , the fact is always mentioned .</p>

    <docImprint>This chronological method of arrangement , however , has its limits . It is not possible always to adopt it : nor is it invariably ‘ necessary ’ , even in order to obtain a true view of the growth of Wordsworth 's mind . In this — as in so many other things — wisdom lies in the avoidance of extremes ; the extreme of rigid fidelity to the order of time on the one hand , and the extreme of an irrational departure from it on the other . While an effort has been made to discover the exact order of the composition of the poems — and this is shown , not only in the Chronological Table , but at the beginning of each separate poem — it has been considered expedient to depart from that order in printing some of the poems . In certain cases a poem was begun and laid aside , and again resumed at intervals ; and it is difficult to know to what year the larger part of it should be assigned . When we know the date at which a poem was commenced , and that it was finished “ long afterwards , ” but have no clue as to the year , it is assigned to the year in which it was begun . For example , the ‘ Address to Kilchurn Castle ’ was begun in<date>1803</date>, but only the first three lines were written then . Wordsworth tells us that “ the rest was added many years after , ” but when we know not ; and the poem was not published till<date>1827</date>. In such a case , it is placed in this edition as if it belonged chronologically to<date>1803</date>, and retains its place in the series of Poems which memorialise the Tour in Scotland of that year . On a similar principle , ‘ The Highland Girl ’ is placed in the same series ; although Dorothy Wordsworth tells us , in her Journal of the Tour , that it was composed “ not long after our return from Scotland ” ; and ‘ Glen Almain ’ — although written afterwards at Rydal — retains its published place in the memorial group . Again the ‘ Departure from the Vale of Grasmere , August<date>1803</date>’ , is prefixed to the same series ; although it was not written till<date>1811</date>, and first published in<date>1827</date>. To give symmetry to such a Series , it is necessary to depart from the exact chronological order — the departure being duly indicated . On the same principle I have followed the ‘ Address to the Scholars of the Village School of —— ’ , by its natural sequel — ‘ By the Side of the Grave some Years after ’ , the date of the composition of which is unknown : and the ‘ Epistle to Sir George Beaumont ’ (<date>1811</date>) is followed by the later Lines , to which Wordsworth gave the most prosaic title — he was often infelicitous in his titles — ‘ Upon perusing the foregoing Epistle thirty years after its composition ’ . A like remark applies to the poem ‘ Beggars ’ , which is followed by its own ‘ Sequel ’ , although the order of date is disturbed ; while all the “ Epitaphs , ” translated from Chiabrera , are printed together . It is manifestly appropriate that the poems belonging to a series — such as the “ Ecclesiastical Sonnets , ” or those referring to the “ Duddon ” — should be brought together , as Wordsworth finally arranged them ; even although we may be aware that some of them were written subsequently , and placed in the middle of the series . The sonnets referring to “ Aspects of Christianity in<country>America</country>” — inserted in the<date>1845</date>and<date>1849-50</date>editions of the collected Works — are found in no previous edition or version of the “ Ecclesiastical Sonnets . ” These , along with some others on the Offices of the English Liturgy , were suggested to Wordsworth by an American prelate , Bishop Doane , and by Professor Henry Reed ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>but we do not know in what year they were written . The “ Ecclesiastical Sonnets ” — first called “ Ecclesiastical Sketches ” — were written in the years<date>1820-22</date>. The above additions to them appeared twenty-five years afterwards ; but they ought manifestly to retain their place , as arranged by Wordsworth in the edition of<date>1845</date>. The case is much the same with regard to the “ Duddon Sonnets . ” They were first published in<date>1820</date>: but No . xiv . beginning : O mountain Stream ! the Shepherd and his Cot , was written in the year<date>1806</date>, and appears in the edition of<date>1807</date>. This sonnet will be printed in the series to which it belongs , and not in its chronological place . I think it would be equally unjust to remove it from the group — in which it helps to form a unity — and to print it twice over .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>On the other hand , the series of “ Poems composed during a Tour in Scotland , and on the English Border , in the Autumn of<date>1831</date>” — and first published in the year<date>1835</date>, in the volume entitled “ Yarrow Revisited , and Other Poems ” — contains two , which Wordsworth himself tells us were composed earlier ; and there is no reason why these poems should not be restored to their chronological place . The series of itinerary sonnets , published along with them in the Yarrow volume of<date>1835</date>, is the record of another Scottish tour , taken in the year<date>1833</date>; and Wordsworth says of them that they were “ composed ‘ or suggested ’ during a tour in the summer of<date>1833</date>. ” We cannot now discover which of them were written during the tour , and which at Rydal Mount after his return ; but it is obvious that they should be printed in the order in which they were left by him , in<date>1835</date>. It may be noted that almost all the “ Evening Voluntaries ” belong to these years —<date>1832</date>to<date>1835</date>— when the author was from sixty-two to sixty-five years of age . Wordsworth 's habit of revision may perhaps explain the mistakes into which he occasionally fell as to the dates of his Poems , and the difficulty of reconciling what he says , as to the year of composition , with the date assigned by his sister in her Journal . When he says “ written in<date>1801</date>, or<date>1802</date>, ” he may be referring to the last revision which he gave to his work . Certain it is , however , that he sometimes gave a date for the composition , which was subsequent to the publication of the poem in question . In the case of those poems to which no date was attached , I have tried to find a clue by which to fix an approximate one . Obviously , it would not do to place all the undated poems in a class by themselves . Such an arrangement would be thoroughly artificial ; and , while we are in many instances left to conjecture , we can always say that such and such a poem was composed not later than a particular year . When the precise date is undiscoverable , I have thought it best to place the poem in or immediately before the year in which it was first published . Poems which were several years in process of composition , having been laid aside , and taken up repeatedly ; ‘ e. g . The Prelude ’ , which was composed between the years<date>1799</date>and<date>1805</date>— are placed in the year in which they were finished . Disputable questions as to the date of any poem are dealt with in the editorial note prefixed or appended to it . There is one Poem which I have intentionally placed out of its chronological place , viz . the ‘ Ode , Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood ’ . It was written at intervals from<date>1803</date>to<date>1806</date>, and was first published in the edition of<date>1807</date>, where it stood at the end of the second volume . In every subsequent edition of the collected Works —<date>1815</date>to<date>1850</date>— it closed the groups of poems ; ‘ The Excursion ’ only following it , in a volume of its own . This was an arrangement made by Wordsworth , of set purpose , and steadily adhered to — the ‘ Ode ’ forming as it were the High Altar of his poetic Cathedral . As he wished it to retain that place in subsequent editions of his Works , it retains it in this one . Mr. Arnold 's arrangement of the Poems , in his volume of Selections<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>, is extremely interesting and valuable ; but , as to the method of grouping adopted , I am not sure that it is better than Wordsworth 's own . As a descriptive title , “ Poems of Sentiment and Reflection ” is quite as good as “ Poems akin to the Antique , ” and “ Poems of the Fancy ” quite as appropriate as “ Poems of Ballad Form . ” Wordsworth 's arrangement of his Poems in groups was psychologically very interesting ; but it is open to many objections . Unfortunately Wordsworth was not himself consistent — in the various editions issued by himself — either in the class into which he relegated each poem , or the order in which he placed it there . There is tantalising topsy-turvyism in this , so that an editor who adopts it is almost compelled to select Wordsworth 's latest grouping , which was not always his best . Sir William Rowan Hamilton wrote to Mr. Aubrey de Vere in<date>1835</date>that Dora Wordsworth told him that her father “ was sometimes at a loss whether to refer her to the ‘ Poems of the Imagination , ’ or the ‘ Poems of the Fancy , ’ for some particular passage . ” Aubrey de Vere himself considered Wordsworth 's arrangement as “ a parade of system , ” and wrote of it , “ I cannot help thinking that in it , he mistakes classification for method . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>I confess that it is often difficult to see why some of the poems were assigned by their author to the realm of the “ Fancy , ” the “ Imagination , ” and “ Sentiment and Reflection ” respectively . In a note to ‘ The Horn of Egremont Castle ’ ( edition<date>1815</date>) Wordsworth speaks of it as “ referring to the imagination , ” rather than as being “ produced by it ” ; and says that he would not have placed it amongst his “ Poems of the Imagination , ” “ but to avoid a needless multiplication of classes ” ; and in the editions of<date>1827</date>and<date>1832</date>he actually included the great ‘ Ode ’ on Immortality among his “ Epitaphs and Elegiac Poems ” ! As late as 27th September<date>1845</date>, he wrote to Professor Henry Reed , “ Following your example ” ( i. e. the example set in Reed 's American edition of the Poems ) , “ I have greatly extended the class entitled ‘ Poems of the Imagination , ’ thinking as you must have done that , if Imagination were predominant in the class , it was not indispensable that it should pervade every poem which it contained . Limiting the class as I had done before , seemed to imply , and to the uncandid or observing did so , that the faculty , which is the ‘ primum mobile ’ in poetry , had little to do , in the estimation of the author , with pieces not arranged under that head . I therefore feel much obliged to you for suggesting by your practice the plan which I have adopted . ” Could anything show more explicitly than this that Wordsworth was not perfectly satisfied with his own artificial groups ? Professor Reed , in his American edition of<date>1837</date>, however , acted on Wordsworth 's expressed intention of distributing the contents of “ Yarrow Revisited , and Other Poems ” amongst the classes . He tells us that he “ interspersed the contents of this volume among the Poems already arranged ” by Wordsworth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>It may also be mentioned that not only members of his own household , but many of Wordsworth 's friends — notably Charles Lamb — expressed a preference for a different arrangement of his Poems from that which he had adopted . SECOND The various Readings , or variations of text , made by Wordsworth during his lifetime , or written by him on copies of his Poems , or discovered in MS. letters , from himself , or his sister , or his wife , are given in footnotes in this edition . Few English poets changed their text more frequently , or with more fastidiousness , than Wordsworth did . He did not always alter it for the better . Every alteration however , which has been discovered by me , whether for the better or for the worse , is here printed in full . We have thus a record of the fluctuations of his own mind as to the form in which he wished his Poems to appear ; and this record casts considerable light on the development of his genius .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>A knowledge of these changes of text can only be obtained in one or other of two ways . Either the reader must have access to all the thirty-two editions of Poems , the publication of which Wordsworth personally supervised ; or , he must have all the changes in the successive editions , exhibited in the form of footnotes , and appended to the particular text that is selected and printed in the body of the work . It is extremely difficult — in some cases quite impossible — to obtain the early editions . The great public libraries of the country do not possess them all .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>It is therefore necessary to fall back upon the latter plan , which seems the only one by which a knowledge of the changes of the text can be made accessible , either to the general reader , or to the special student of English Poetry . The text which — after much consideration — I have resolved to place throughout , in the body of the work , is Wordsworth 's own final ‘ textus receptus ’ , i. e . the text of<date>1849-50</date>, reproduced in the posthumous edition of<date>1857</date>;<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>and since opinion will doubtless differ as to the wisdom of this selection , it may be desirable to state at some length the reasons which have led me to adopt it . There are only three possible courses open to an editor , who wishes to give — along with the text selected — all the various readings chronologically arranged as footnotes . Either , 1st , the earliest text may be taken , or 2nd , the latest may be chosen , or 3rd , the text may be selected from different editions , so as to present each poem in its best state ( according to the judgment of the editor ) , in whatever edition it is found . A composite text , made up from two or more editions , would be inadmissible . Now , most persons who have studied the subject know that Wordsworth 's best text is to be found , in one poem in its earliest edition , in another in its latest , and in a third in some intermediate edition . I cannot agree either with the statement that he always altered for the worse , or that he always altered for the better . His critical judgment was not nearly so unerring in this respect as Coleridge 's was , or as Tennyson 's has been . It may be difficult , therefore , to assign an altogether satisfactory reason for adopting either the earliest or the latest text ; and at first sight , the remaining alternative plan may seem the wisest of the three . There are indeed difficulties in the way of the adoption of any one of the methods suggested ; and as I adopt the latest text — not because it is always intrinsically the best , but on other grounds to be immediately stated — it may clear the way , if reference be made in the first instance to the others , and to the reasons for abandoning them . As to a selection of the text from various editions , this would doubtless be the best plan , were it a practicable one ; and perhaps it may be attainable some day . But Wordsworth is as yet too near us for such an editorial treatment of his Works to be successful . The fundamental objection to it is that scarcely two minds — even among the most competent of contemporary judges — will agree as to what the best text is . An edition arranged on this principle could not possibly be acceptable to more than a few persons . Of course no arrangement of any kind can escape adverse criticism : it would be most unfortunate if it did . But this particular edition would fail in its main purpose , if questions of individual taste were made primary , and not secondary ; and an arrangement , which gave scope for the arbitrary selection of particular texts ,— according to the wisdom , or the want of wisdom , of the editor ,— would deservedly meet with severe criticism in many quarters . Besides , such a method of arrangement would not indicate the growth of the Poet 's mind , and the development of his genius . If an editor wished to indicate his own opinion of the best text for each poem — under the idea that his judgment might be of some use to other people — it would be wiser to do so by means of some mark or marginal note , than by printing his selected text in the main body of the work . He could thus at once preserve the chronological order of the readings , indicate his own preference , and leave it to others to select what they preferred . Besides , the compiler of such an edition would often find himself in doubt as to what the best text really was , the merit of the different readings being sometimes almost equal , or very nearly balanced ; and , were he to endeavour to get out of the difficulty by obtaining the judgments of literary men , or even of contemporary poets , he would find that their opinions would in most cases be dissimilar , if they did not openly conflict . Those who cannot come to a final decision as to their own text would not be likely to agree as to the merits of particular readings in the poems of their predecessors . Unanimity of opinion on this point is indeed quite unattainable . Nevertheless , it would be easy for an editor to show the unfortunate result of keeping rigorously either to the latest or to the earliest text of Wordsworth . If , on the one hand , the latest were taken , it could be shown that many of the changes introduced into it were for the worse , and some of them very decidedly so . For example , in the poem ‘ To a Skylark ’ — composed in<date>1825</date>— the second verse , retained in the editions of<date>1827</date>,<date>1832</date>,<date>1836</date>, and<date>1843</date>, was unaccountably dropped out in the editions of<date>1845</date>and<date>1849</date>. The following is the complete poem of<date>1825</date>, as published in<date>1827</date>. Ethereal Minstrel ! Pilgrim of the sky ! Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound ? Or , while the wings aspire , are heart and eye Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground ? Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will , Those quivering wings composed , that music still ! To the last point of vision , and beyond , Mount , daring Warbler ! that love-prompted strain , ( ‘ Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond ) Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain : Yet might'st thou seem , proud privilege ! to sing All independent of the leafy spring . Leave to the Nightingale her shady wood ; A privacy of glorious light is thine ; Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood Of harmony , with rapture more divine ; Type of the wise who soar , but never roam ; True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home ! There is no doubt that the first and third stanzas are the finest , and some may respect the judgment that cut down the Poem by the removal of its second verse : but others will say , if it was right that such a verse should be removed , why were many others of questionable merit allowed to remain ? Why was such a poem as ‘ The Glowworm ’ , of the edition of<date>1807</date>, never republished ; while ‘ The Waterfall and the Eglantine ’ , and ‘ To the Spade of a Friend ’ , were retained ? To give one other illustration , where a score are possible . In the sonnet , belonging to the year<date>1807</date>, beginning :</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ Beloved Vale ! ” I said , “ when I shall con , ”</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>we find , in the latest text , the lines — first adopted in<date>1827</date>: I stood , of simple shame the blushing Thrall ; So narrow seemed the brooks , the fields so small , while the early edition of<date>1807</date>contains the far happier lines : To see the Trees , which I had thought so tall , Mere dwarfs ; the Brooks so narrow , Fields so small . On the other hand , if the earliest text be invariably retained , some of the best poems will be spoiled ( or the improvements lost ) , since Wordsworth did usually alter for the better . For example , few persons will doubt that the form in which the second stanza of the poem ‘ To the Cuckoo ’ ( written in<date>1802</date>) appeared in<date>1845</date>, is an improvement on all its predecessors . I give the readings of<date>1807</date>,<date>1815</date>,<date>1820</date>,<date>1827</date>, and<date>1845</date>. While I am lying on the grass , I hear thy restless shout : From hill to hill it seems to pass , About , and all about !<date>1807</date>. While I am lying on the grass , Thy loud note smites my ear !— From hill to hill it seems to pass , At once far off and near !<date>1815</date>. While I am lying on the grass , Thy loud note smites my ear ! It seems to fill the whole air 's space , At once far off and near .<date>1820</date>. While I am lying on the grass Thy twofold shout I hear , That seems to fill the whole air 's space , As loud far off as near .<date>1827</date>. While I am lying on the grass Thy twofold shout I hear , From hill to hill it seems to pass , At once far off , and near .<date>1845</date>. Similarly , in each of the three poems ‘ To the Daisy ’ , composed in<date>1802</date>, and in the ‘ Afterthought , to the Duddon ’ , the alterations introduced into the latest editions were all improvements upon the early version . It might be urged that these considerations would warrant the interference of an editor , and justify him in selecting the text which he thought the best upon the whole ; but this must be left to posterity . When editors can escape the bias of contemporary thought and feeling , when their judgments are refined by distance and mellowed by the new literary standards of the intervening years ,— when in fact Wordsworth is as far away from his critics as Shakespeare now is — it may be possible to adjust a final text . But the task is beyond the power of the present generation . It may farther be urged that if this reasoning be valid ,— and if , for the present , one text must be retained uniformly throughout ,— the natural plan is to take the earliest , and not the latest ; and this has some recommendations . It seems more simple , more natural , and certainly the easiest . We have a natural sequence , if we begin with the earliest and go on to the latest readings . Then , all the readers of Wordsworth , who care to possess or to consult the present edition , will doubtless possess one or other of the complete copies of his works , which contain his final text ; while probably not one in twenty have ever seen the first edition of any of his poems , with the exception of ‘ The Prelude ’ . It is true that if the reader turns to a footnote to compare the versions of different years , while he is reading for the sake of the poetry , he will be so distracted that the effect of the poem as a whole will be entirely lost ; because the critical spirit , which judges of the text , works apart from the spirit of sympathetic appreciation , in which all poetry should be read . But it is not necessary to turn to the footnotes , and to mark what may be called the literary growth of a poem , while it is being read for its own sake : and these notes are printed in smaller type , so as not to obtrude themselves on the eye of the reader . Against the adoption of the earlier text , there is this fatal objection , that if it is to be done at all , it must be done throughout ; and , in the earliest poems Wordsworth wrote — viz . ‘ An Evening Walk ’ and ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ ,— the subsequent alterations almost amounted to a cancelling of the earlier version . His changes were all , or almost all , unmistakably for the better . Indeed , there was little in these works — in the form in which they first appeared — to lead to the belief that an original poet had arisen in<country>England</country>. It is true that Coleridge saw in them the signs of the dawn of a new era , and wrote thus of ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ , before he knew its author , “ Seldom , if ever , was the emergence of a great and original poetic genius above the literary horizon more evidently announced . ” Nevertheless the earliest text of these ‘ Sketches ’ is , in many places , so artificial , prosaic , and dull , that its reproduction ( except as an appendix , or in the form of footnotes ) would be an injustice to Wordsworth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>On the other hand , the passages subsequently cancelled are so numerous , and so long , that if placed in footnotes the latter would in some instances be more extensive than the text . The quarto of<date>1793</date>will therefore be reprinted in full as an Appendix to the first volume of this edition . The ‘ School Exercise written at Hawkshead ’ in the poet 's fourteenth year , will be found in vol . viii . Passing over these juvenile efforts , there are poems — such as ‘ Guilt and Sorrow ’ , ‘ Peter Bell ’ , and many others — in which the earlier text is an inferior one , which was either corrected or abandoned by Wordsworth in his maturer years . It would be a conspicuous blunder to print — in the place of honour ,— the crude original which was afterwards repudiated by its author . It may be remembered , in connection with Wordsworth 's text , that he himself said , “ I am for the most part uncertain about my success in altering poems ; but , in this case ” ( he is speaking of an insertion ) “ I am sure I have produced a great improvement . ” ( ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ , vol . i. p . 174 . )<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Again , in writing to Mr. Dyce in<date>1830</date>, “ You know what importance I attach to following strictly the last copy of the text of an author . ” It is also worthy of note that the study of their chronology casts some light on the changes which the poems underwent . The second edition of “ Lyrical Ballads ” appeared in<date>1800</date>. In that edition the text of<date>1798</date>is scarcely altered : but , in the year in which it was published , Wordsworth was engrossed with his settlement at Grasmere ; and , in the springtime of creative work , he probably never thought of revising his earlier pieces . In the year<date>1800</date>, he composed at least twenty-five new poems . The third edition of “ Lyrical Ballads ” appeared in<date>1802</date>; and during that year he wrote forty-three new poems , many of them amongst the most perfect of his Lyrics . His critical instinct had become much more delicate since<date>1800</date>: and it is not surprising to find — as we do find — that between the text of the “ Lyrical Ballads ” of<date>1800</date>, and that of<date>1802</date>, there are many important variations . This is seen , for example , in the way in which he dealt with ‘ The Female Vagrant ’ , which is altered throughout . Its early redundance is pruned away ; and , in many instances , the final text , sanctioned in<date>1845</date>, had been adopted in<date>1803</date>. Without going into further detail , it is sufficient to remark that in the year<date>1803</date>Wordsworth 's critical faculty , the faculty of censorship , had developed almost step for step with the creative originality of his genius . In that prolific year , when week by week , almost day by day , fresh poems were thrown off with marvellous facility — as we see from his sister 's Journal — he had become a severe , if not a fastidious , critic of his own earlier work . A further explanation of the absence of critical revision , in the edition of<date>1800</date>, may be found in the fact that during that year Wordsworth was engaged in writing the “ Preface ” to his Poems ; which dealt , in so remarkable a manner , with the nature of Poetry in general , and with his own theory of it in particular . A further reference to the ‘ Evening Walk ’ will illustrate Wordsworth 's way of dealing with his earlier text in his later editions . This Poem showed from the first a minute observation of Nature — not only in her external form and colour , but also in her suggestiveness — though not in her symbolism ; and we also find the same transition from Nature to Man , the same interest in rural life , and the same lingering over its incidents that we see in his maturer poems . Nevertheless , there is much that is conventional in the first edition of ‘ An Evening Walk ’ , published in<date>1793</date>. I need only mention , as a sample , the use of the phrase “ silent tides ” to describe the waters of a lake . When this poem was revised , in the year<date>1815</date>— with a view to its insertion in the first edition of the collected works — Wordsworth merely omitted large portions of it , and some of its best passages were struck out . He scarcely amended the text at all . In<date>1820</date>, however , he pruned and improved it throughout ; so that between this poem , as recast in<date>1820</date>( and reproduced almost ‘ verbatim ’ in the next two editions of<date>1827</date>and<date>1832</date>) , and his happiest descriptions of Nature in his most inspired moods , there is no great difference . But , in<date>1836</date>, he altered it still further in detail ; and in that state practically left it , apparently not caring to revise it further . In the edition of<date>1845</date>, however , there are several changes . So far as I can judge , there is one alteration for the worse , and one only . The reading , in the edition of<date>1793</date>, In these lone vales , if aught of faith may claim , Thin silver hairs , and ancient hamlet fame ; When up the hills , as now , retreats the light , Strange apparitions mock the village sight , is better than that finally adopted , In these secluded vales , if village fame , Confirmed by hoary hairs , belief may claim ; When up the hills , as now , retired the light , Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd 's sight . It will be seen , however , from the changes made in the text of this poem , how Wordsworth 's observation of Nature developed , how thoroughly dissatisfied he soon became with everything conventional , and discarded every image not drawn directly or at first hand from Nature . The text adopted in the present edition is , for the reasons stated , that which was finally sanctioned by Wordsworth himself , in the last edition of his Poems (<date>1849-50</date>) . The earlier readings , occurring in previous editions , are given in footnotes ; and it may be desirable to explain the way in which these are arranged . It will be seen that whenever the text has been changed a date is given in the footnote , ‘ before ’ the other readings are added . This date , which accompanies the reference number of the footnote , indicates the year in which the reading finally retained was first adopted by Wordsworth . The earlier readings then follow , in chronological order , with the year to which they belong ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>and it is in every case to be assumed that the last of the changes indicated was continued in all subsequent editions of the works . No direct information is given as to how long a particular reading was retained , or through how many editions it ran . It is to be assumed , however , that it was retained in all intermediate editions till the next change of text is stated . It would encumber the notes with too many figures if , in every instance in which a change was made , the corresponding state of the text in all the other editions was indicated . But if no new reading follows the text quoted , it is to be taken for granted that the reading in question was continued in every subsequent edition , until the date which accompanies the reference figure . Two illustrations will make this clear . The first is a case in which the text was only altered once , the second an instance in which it was altered six times . In the ‘ Evening Walk ’ the following lines occur — The dog , loud barking , ‘ mid the glittering rocks , Hunts , where his master points , the intercepted flocks . And the footnote is as follows :</docImprint>
    <docDate><date>1836</date>. That , barking busy ‘ mid the glittering rocks , Hunts , where he points , the intercepted flocks ;<date>1793</date>.</docDate>
    <docImprint>In the light of what has been said above , and by reference to the Bibliography , it will be seen from these two dates that the original text of<date>1793</date>— given in the footnote — was continued in the editions of<date>1820</date>,<date>1827</date>, and<date>1832</date>( it was omitted from the “ extract ” of<date>1815</date>) ; that it was changed in the year<date>1836</date>; and that this reading was retained in the editions of<date>1843</date>,<date>1845</date>, and<date>1849</date>. Again , in ‘ Simon Lee ’ , the lines occur : But what to them avails the land Which he can till no longer ? And the following are the footnotes :</docImprint>
    <docDate><date>1845</date>. But what avails the land to them , Which they can till no longer ?<date>1798</date>.</docDate>
    <docImprint>“ But what , ” saith he , “ avails the land , Which I can till no longer ?<date>1827</date>. But what avails it now , the land Which he can till no longer ?<date>1832</date>. ‘ Tis his , but what avails the land Which he can till no longer ?<date>1837</date>. The time , alas ! is come when he Can till the land no longer .<date>1840</date>. The time is also come when he Can till the land no longer . C. From this it will be seen that the text adopted in the first edition of “ Lyrical Ballads ” in<date>1798</date>was retained in the editions of<date>1800</date>,<date>1802</date>,<date>1805</date>,<date>1815</date>, and<date>1820</date>; that it was altered in each of the editions of<date>1827</date>,<date>1832</date>,<date>1837</date>,<date>1840</date>, as also in the MS. readings in Lord Coleridge 's copy of the works , and in the edition of<date>1845</date>; and that the version of<date>1845</date>was retained in the edition of<date>1849-50</date>. It should be added that when a verse , or stanza , or line — occurring in one or other of the earlier editions — was omitted from that of<date>1849</date>, the footnote simply contains the extract along with the date of the year or years in which it occurs ; and that , in such cases , the date does not follow the reference number of the footnote , but is placed for obvious reasons at the end of the extract . The same thing is true of ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ . In the year<date>1827</date>, there were scarcely any alterations made on the text of the poem , as printed in<date>1820</date>; still fewer were added in<date>1832</date>; but for the edition of<date>1836</date>the whole was virtually rewritten , and in that state it was finally left , although a few significant changes were made in<date>1845</date>. Slight changes of spelling which occur in the successive editions , are not mentioned . When , however , the change is one of transposition , although the text remains unaltered ,— as is largely the case in ‘ Simon Lee ’ , for example — it is always indicated . It will be further observed that , at the beginning of every poem , two dates are given ; the first , on the left-hand side , is the date of composition ; the second , on the right-hand side , is the date of the first publication . In what class the poem first appeared , and the changes ( if any ) which subsequently occurred in its title , are mentioned in the note appended . THIRD . In the present edition several suggested changes of text , which were written by Wordsworth on the margin of a copy of his edition of<date>1836-7</date>, which he kept beside him at Rydal Mount , are published . These MS. notes seem to have been written by himself , or dictated to others , at intervals between the years<date>1836</date>and<date>1850</date>, and they are thus a record of passing thoughts , or “ moods of his own mind , ” during these years . Some of these were afterwards introduced into the editions of<date>1842</date>,<date>1846</date>, and<date>1849</date>; others were not made use of . The latter have now a value of their own , as indicating certain new phases of thought and feeling , in Wordsworth 's later years . I owe my knowledge of them , and the permission to use them , to the kindness of the late Chief Justice of<country>England</country>, Lord Coleridge . The following is an extract from a letter from him : “ FOX GHYLL , AMBLESIDE , ‘ 4th October<date>1881</date>’ . “ I have been long intending to write you as to the manuscript notes and alterations in Wordsworth 's poems , which you have had the opportunity of seeing , and , so far as you thought fit , of using for your edition . They came into my possession in this way . I saw them advertised in a catalogue which was sent me , and at my request the book was very courteously forwarded to me for my inspection . It appeared to me of sufficient interest and value to induce me to buy it ; and I accordingly became the purchaser . “ It is a copy of the edition in six volumes , the publication of which began in the year<date>1836</date>; and of the volume containing the collected sonnets , which was afterwards printed uniformly with that edition . It appears to have been the copy which Wordsworth himself used for correcting , altering , and adding to the poems contained in it . As you have seen , in some of the poems the Alterations are very large , amounting sometimes to a complete rewriting of considerable passages . Many of these alterations have been printed in subsequent editions ; some have not ; two or three small poems , as far as I know , have not been hitherto published . Much of the writing is Wordsworth 's own ; but perhaps the larger portion is the hand-writing of others , one or more , not familiar to me as Wordsworth 's is . “ How the volumes came to be sold I do not know .... Such as they are , and whatever be their interest or value , you are , as far as I am concerned , heartily welcome to them ; and I shall be glad indeed if they add in the least degree to make your edition more worthy of the great man for whom my admiration grows every day I live , and my deep gratitude to whom will cease only with my life , and my reason . ” This precious copy of the edition of<date>1836-7</date>is now the property of Lady Coleridge . I re-examined it in<date>1894</date>, and added several readings , which I had omitted to note twelve years ago , when Lord Coleridge first showed it to me . I should add that , since the issue of the volumes of<date>1882-6</date>, many other MS. copies of individual Poems have come under my notice ; and that every important variation of text in them is incorporated in this edition . As it is impossible to discover the precise year in which the suggested alterations of text were written by Wordsworth , on the margin of the edition of<date>1836</date>, they will be indicated , wherever they occur , by the initial letter C. Comparatively few changes occur in the poems of early years . A copy of the<date>1814</date>( quarto ) edition of ‘ The Excursion ’ , now in the possession of a grandson of the poet , the Rev . John Wordsworth , Gosforth Rectory , Cumberland — which was the copy Wordsworth kept at Rydal Mount for annotation and correction , much in the same way as he kept the edition of<date>1836-7</date>— has also been kindly sent to me by its present owner , for examination and use in this edition ; and , in it , I have found some additional readings . FOURTH . In the present edition all the Notes and Memoranda , explanatory of the Poems , which Wordsworth dictated to Miss Fenwick , are given in full . Miss Fenwick lived much at Rydal Mount , during the later years of the Poet 's life ; and it is to their friendship , and to her inducing Wordsworth to dictate these Notes , that we owe most of the information we possess , as to the occasions and circumstances under which his poems were composed . These notes were first made use of — although only in a fragmentary manner — by the late Bishop of Lincoln , in the ‘ Memoirs ’ of his uncle . They were afterwards incorporated in full in the edition of<date>1857</date>, issued by Mr. Moxon , under the direction of Mr. Carter ; and in the centenary edition . They were subsequently printed in ‘ The Prose Works of Wordsworth ’ , edited by Dr. Grosart ; and in my edition of<date>1882-6</date>. I am uncertain whether it was the original MS ., written by Miss Fenwick , or the copy of it afterwards taken for Miss Quillinan , to which Dr. Grosart had access . The text of these Notes , as printed in the edition of<date>1857</date>, is certainly ( in very many cases ) widely different from what is given in ‘ The Prose Works ’ of<date>1876</date>. I have made many corrections — from the MS. which I have examined with care — of errors which exist in all previously printed copies of these Notes , including my own . What appears in this volume is printed from a MS ., which Miss Quillinan gave me to examine and copy , and which she assured me was the original one . The proper place for these Fenwick Notes is doubtless that which was assigned to them by the editor of<date>1857</date>, viz . before the poems which they respectively illustrate .</docImprint>
    <docDate>FIFTH . Topographical Notes , explanatory of the allusions made by Wordsworth to the localities in the English Lake District , and elsewhere , are added throughout the volumes . This has already been attempted to some extent by several writers , but a good deal more remains to be done ; and I may repeat what I wrote on this subject , in<date>1878</date>. Many of Wordsworth 's allusions to Place are obscure , and the exact localities difficult to identify . It is doubtful if he cared whether they could be afterwards traced out or not ; and in reference to one particular rock , referred to in the “ Poems on the Naming of Places , ” when asked by a friend to localise it , he declined ; replying to the question , “ Yes , that — or any other that will suit ! ” There is no doubt that , in many instances , his allusions to place are intentionally vague ; and , in some of his most realistic passages , he avowedly weaves together a description of localities remote from each other . It is true that “ Poems of Places ” are not meant to be photographs ; and were they simply to reproduce the features of a particular district , and be an exact transcript of reality , they would be literary photographs , and not poems . Poetry cannot , in the nature of things , be a mere register of phenomena appealing to the eye or the ear . No imaginative writer , however , in the whole range of English Literature , is so peculiarly identified with locality as Wordsworth is ; and there is not one on the roll of poets , the appreciation of whose writings is more aided by an intimate knowledge of the district in which he lived . The wish to be able to identify his allusions to those places , which he so specially interpreted , is natural to every one who has ever felt the spell of his genius ; and it is indispensable to all who would know the special charm of a region , which he described as “ a national property , ” and of which he , beyond all other men , may be said to have effected the literary “ conveyance ” to posterity . But it has been asked — and will doubtless be asked again — what is the use of a minute identification of all these places ? Is not the general fact that Wordsworth described this district of mountain , vale , and mere , sufficient , without any further attempt at localisation ? The question is more important , and has wider bearings , than appears upon the surface . It must be admitted , on the one hand , that the discovery of the precise point in every local allusion is not necessary to an understanding or appreciation of the Poems . But , it must be remembered , on the other hand , that Wordsworth was never contented with simply copying what he saw in Nature . Of the ‘ Evening Walk ’ — written in his eighteenth year — he says that the plan of the poem “ has not been confined to a particular walk or an individual place ; a proof ( of which I was unconscious at the time ) of my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance . The country is idealised rather than described in any one of its local aspects . "[ 13 ] Again , he says of the ‘ Lines written while Sailing in a Boat at Evening ': “ It was during a solitary walk on the banks of the Cam that I was first struck with this appearance , and applied it to my own feelings in the manner here expressed , changing the scene to the Thames , near Windsor ” ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>and of ‘ Guilt and Sorrow ’ , he said , “ To obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are well acquainted with Salisbury Plain , it may be proper to say , that of the features described as belonging to it , one or two are taken from other desolate parts of England . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>In ‘ The Excursion ’ he passes from Langdale to Grasmere , over to Patterdale , back to Grasmere , and again to Hawes Water , without warning ; and even in the case of the “ Duddon Sonnets ” he introduces a description taken direct from Rydal . Mr. Aubrey de Vere tells of a conversation he had with Wordsworth , in which he vehemently condemned the ultra-realistic poet , who goes to Nature with</docDate>
    <epigraph>
     <p>“ pencil and note-book , and jots down whatever strikes him most , ” adding , “ Nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms ! He should have left his pencil and note-book at home ; fixed his eye as he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him , and taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy . Afterwards he would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was preserved to him , much was also most wisely obliterated . That which remained , the picture surviving in his mind , would have presented the ideal and essential truth of the scene , and done so in large part by discarding much which , though in itself striking , was not characteristic . In every scene , many of the most brilliant details are but accidental . ” The two last sentences of this extract give admirable expression to one feature of Wordsworth 's interpretation of Nature . In the deepest poetry , as in the loftiest music ,— in Wordsworth 's lyrics as in Beethoven 's sonatas — it is by what they unerringly suggest and not by what they exhaustively express that their truth and power are known . “ In what he leaves unsaid , ” wrote Schiller , “ I discover the master of style . ” It depends , no doubt , upon the vision of the “ inward eye , ” and the reproductive power of the idealising mind , whether the result is a travesty of Nature , or the embodiment of a truth higher than Nature yields . On the other hand , it is equally certain that the identification of localities casts a sudden light in many instances upon obscure passages in a poem , and is by far the best commentary that can be given . It is much to be able to compare the actual scene , with the ideal creation suggested by it ; as the latter was both Wordsworth 's reading of the text of Nature , and his interpretation of it . In his seventy-third year , he said , looking back on his ‘ Evening Walk ’ , that there was not an image in the poem which he had not observed , and that he “ recollected the time and place where most of them were noted . ” In the Fenwick notes , we constantly find him saying , “ the fact occurred strictly as recorded , ” “ the fact was as mentioned in the poem ” ; and the fact very often involved the accessories of place . Any one who has tried to trace out the allusions in the “ Poems on the Naming of Places , ” or to discover the site of “ Michael 's Sheepfold , ” to identify “ Ghimmer Crag , ” or “ Thurston-Mere , ” — not to speak of the individual “ rocks ” and “ recesses ” near Blea Tarn at the head of Little Langdale so minutely described in ‘ The Excursion ’ ,— will admit that local commentary is an important aid to the understanding of Wordsworth . If to read the ‘ Yew Trees ’ in Borrowdale itself , in mute repose To lie , and listen to the mountain flood Murmuring from Glaramara 's inmost caves , to read ‘ The Brothers ’ in Ennerdale , or “ The Daffodils ” by the shore of Ullswater , gives a new significance to these “ poems of the imagination , ” a discovery of the obscurer allusions to place or scene will deepen our appreciation of those passages in which his idealism is most pronounced . Every one knows Kirkstone Pass , Aira Force , Dungeon Ghyll , the Wishing Gate , and Helm Crag : many persons know the Glowworm Rock , and used to know the Rock of Names ; but where is “ Emma 's Dell ” ? or “ the meeting point of two highways , ” so characteristically described in the twelfth book of ‘ The Prelude ’ ? and who will fix the site of the pool in Rydal Upper Park , immortalised in the poem ‘ To M. H . ’ ? or identify “ Joanna 's Rock ” ? Many of the places in the English Lake District are undergoing change , and every year the local allusions will be more difficult to trace . Perhaps the most interesting memorial of the poet which existed , viz . the “ Rock of Names , ” on the shore of Thirlmere , is now sunk under the waters of a Manchester reservoir . Other memorials are perishing by the wear and tear of time , the decay of old buildings , the alteration of roads , the cutting down of trees , and the modernising , or “ improving , ” of the district generally . All this is inevitable . But it is well that many of the natural objects , over and around which the light of Wordsworth 's genius lingers , are out of the reach of “ improvements , ” and are indestructible even by machinery . If it be objected that several of the places which we try to identify — and which some would prefer to leave for ever undisturbed in the realm of imagination — were purposely left obscure , it may be replied that Death and Time have probably now removed all reasons for reticence , especially in the case of those poems referring to domestic life and friendly ties . While an author is alive , or while those are alive to whom he has made reference in the course of his allusions to place , it may even be right that works designed for posterity should not be dealt with after the fashion of the modern “ interviewer . ” But greatness has its penalties ; and a “ fierce light ” “ beats around the throne ” of Genius , as well as round that of Empire . Moreover , all experience shows that posterity takes a great and a growing interest in exact topographical illustrations of the works of great authors . The labour recently bestowed upon the places connected with Shakespeare , Scott , and Burns sufficiently attests this . The localities in Westmoreland , which are most permanently associated with Wordsworth , are these : Grasmere , where he lived during the years of his “ poetic prime , ” and where he is buried ; Lower Easdale , where he passed so many days with his sister by the side of the brook , and on the terraces at Lancrigg , and where ‘ The Prelude ’ was dictated ; Rydal Mount , where he spent the latter half of his life , and where he found one of the most perfect retreats in England ; Great Langdale , and Blea Tarn at the head of Little Langdale , immortalised in ‘ The Excursion ’ ; the upper end of Ullswater , and Kirkstone Pass ; and all the mountain tracks and paths round Grasmere and Rydal , especially the old upper road between them , under Nab Scar , his favourite walk during his later years , where he “ composed hundreds of verses . ” There is scarcely a rock or mountain summit , a stream or tarn , or even a well , a grove , or forest-side in all that neighbourhood , which is not imperishably identified with this poet , who at once interpreted them as they had never been interpreted before , and added the gleam , The light that never was , on sea or land , The consecration , and the Poet 's dream .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>It may be worthy of note that Wordsworth himself sanctioned the principle of tracing out local allusions both by dictating the Fenwick notes , and by republishing his Essay on the topography of the Lakes , along with the Duddon Sonnets , in<date>1820</date>— and also , by itself , in<date>1822</date>— “ from a belief that it would tend materially to illustrate ” his poems . In this edition the topographical Notes usually follow the Poems to which they refer . But in the case of the longer Poems , such as ‘ The Prelude ’ , ‘ The Excursion ’ , and others , it seems more convenient to print them at the foot of the page , than to oblige the reader to turn to the end of the volume . From the accident of my having tried long ago — at Principal Shairp 's request — to do what he told me he wished to do , but had failed to carry out , I have been supposed , quite erroneously , to be an ‘ authority ’ on the subject of “ The English Lake District , as interpreted in the Poems of Wordsworth . ” The latter , it is true , is the title of one of the books which I have written about Wordsworth : but , although I visited the Lakes in<date>1860</date>,— “ as a pilgrim resolute ” — and have re-visited the district nearly every year for more than a quarter of a century , I may say that I have only a partial knowledge of it . Others , such as Canon Rawnsley , Mr. Harry Goodwin , and Mr. Rix , for example , know many parts of it much better than I do ; but , as I have often had to compare my own judgment with that of such experts as the late Dr. Cradock , Principal of Brasenose College ,<settlement>Oxford</settlement>, and others , I may add that , when I differ from them , it has been only after a re-examination of their evidence , at the localities themselves . SIXTH . Several Poems , and fragments of poems , hitherto unpublished — or published in stray quarters , and in desultory fashion — will find a place in this edition ; but I reserve these fragments , and place them all together , in an Appendix to the last volume of the “ Poetical Works . ” If it is desirable to print these poems , in such an edition as this , it is equally desirable to separate them from those which Wordsworth himself sanctioned in his final edition of<date>1849-50</date>. Every great author in the Literature of the World — whether he lives to old age ( when his judgment may possibly be less critical ) or dies young ( when it may be relatively more accurate ) — should himself determine what portions of his work ought , and what ought not to survive . At the same time ,— while I do not presume to judge in the case of writers whom I know less fully than I happen to know Wordsworth and his contemporaries ,— it seems clear that the very greatest men have occasionally erred as to what parts of their writings might , with most advantage , survive ; and that they have even more frequently erred as to what MS. letters , etc .,— casting light on their contemporaries — should , or should not , be preserved . I am convinced , for example , that if the Wordsworth household had not destroyed all the letters which Coleridge sent to them , in the first decade of this century , the world would now possess much important knowledge which is for ever lost . It may have been wise , for reasons now unknown , to burn those letters , written by Coleridge : but the students of the literature of the period would gladly have them now . Passing from the question of the preservation of Letters , it is evident that Wordsworth was very careful in distinguishing between the Verses which he sent to Newspapers and Magazines , and those Poems which he included in his published volumes . His anxiety on this point may be inferred from the way in which he more than once emphasised the fact of republication , e. g . in ‘ Peter Bell ’ (<date>1819</date>) he put the following prefatory note to four sonnets , which had previously appeared in ‘ Blackwood 's Magazine ’ , and which afterwards (<date>1828</date>) appeared in the ‘ Poetical Album ’ of Alaric Watts , “ The following Sonnets having lately appeared in Periodical Publications are here reprinted . ” Some of the poems ( or fragments of poems ) , included in the ‘ addenda ’ to Volume viii . of this edition , I would willingly have left out ( especially the sonnet addressed to Miss Maria Williams ) ; but , since they have appeared elsewhere , I feel justified in now reprinting even that trivial youthful effusion , signed “ Axiologus . ” I rejoice , however , that there is no likelihood that the “ Somersetshire Tragedy ” will ever see the light . When I told Wordsworth 's successor in the Laureateship that I had burned a copy of that poem , sent to me by one to whom it had been confided , his delight was great . It is the chronicle of a revolting crime , with nothing in the verse to warrant its publication . The only curious thing about it is that Wordsworth wrote it . With this exception , there is no reason why the fragments which he did not himself republish , and others which he published but afterwards suppressed , should not now be printed . The suppression of some of these by the poet himself is as unaccountable , as is his omission of certain stanzas in the earlier poems from their later versions . Even the<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>‘ Installation Ode ’ , which is so feeble , will be reprinted .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>‘ The Glowworm ’ , which only appeared in the edition of<date>1807</date>, will be republished in full . ‘ Andrew Jones ’ ,— also suppressed after appearing in “ Lyrical Ballads ” of<date>1800</date>,<date>1802</date>, and<date>1805</date>,— will be replaced , in like manner . The youthful ‘ School Exercise ’ written at Hawkshead , the translation from the ‘ Georgics ’ of Virgil , the poem addressed ‘ To the Queen ’ in<date>1846</date>, will appear in their chronological place in vol . viii . There are also a translation of some French stanzas by Francis Wrangham on ‘ The Birth of Love ’ - a poem entitled ‘ The Eagle and the Dove ’ , which was privately printed in a volume , consisting chiefly of French fragments , and called ‘ La petite Chouannerie , ou Historie d'un College Breton sous l'Empire ’ — a sonnet on the rebuilding of a church at Cardiff — an Election Squib written during the Lowther and Brougham contest for the representation of the county of Cumberland in<date>1818</date>— some stanzas written in the Visitors ’ Book at the Ferry , Windermere , and other fragments . Then , since Wordsworth published some verses by his sister Dorothy in his own volumes , other unpublished fragments by Miss Wordsworth may find a place in this edition . I do not attach much importance , however , to the recovery of these unpublished poems . The truth is , as Sir Henry Taylor — himself a poet and critic of no mean order — remarked<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>, “ In these days , when a great man 's path to posterity is likely to be more and more crowded , there is a tendency to create an obstruction , in the desire to give an impulse . To gather about a man 's work all the details that can be found out about it is , in my opinion , to put a drag upon it ; and , as of the Works , so of the Life . ” The industrious labour of some editors in disinterring the trivial works of great men is not a commendable industry . All great writers have occasionally written trifles — this is true even of Shakespeare — and if they wished them to perish , why should we seek to resuscitate them ? Besides , this labour — whether due to the industry of admiring friends , or to the ambition of the literary resurrectionist — is futile ; because the verdict of Time is sure , and posterity is certain to consign the recovered trivialities to kindly oblivion . The question which should invariably present itself to the editor of the fragments of a great writer is , “ Can these bones live ? ” If they cannot , they had better never see the light . Indeed the only good reason for reprinting the fragments which have been lost ( because the author himself attached no value to them ) , is that , in a complete collection of the works of a great man , some of them may have a biographic or psychological value . But have we any right to reproduce , from an antiquarian motive , what — in a literary sense — is either trivial , or feeble , or sterile ? We must , however , distinguish between what is suitable for an edition meant either to popularise an author , or to interpret him , and an edition intended to bring together all that is worthy of preservation for posterity . There is great truth in what Mr. Arnold has lately said of Byron : “ I question whether by reading everything which he gives us , we are so likely to acquire an admiring sense , even of his variety and abundance , as by reading what he gives us at his happier moments . Receive him absolutely without omission and compromise , follow his whole outpouring , stanza by stanza , and line by line , from the very commencement to the very end , and he is capable of being tiresome . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>This is quite true ; nevertheless , English literature demands a complete edition of all the works of Byron : and it may be safely predicted that , for weightier reasons and with greater urgency , it will continue to call for the collected works of Wordsworth . It should also be noted that the fact of Wordsworth 's having dictated to Miss Fenwick ( so late as<date>1843</date>) a stanza from ‘ The Convict ’ in his note to ‘ The Lament of Mary Queen of Scots ’ (<date>1817</date>) , justifies the inclusion of the whole of that ( suppressed ) poem in such an edition as this . The fact that Wordsworth did not republish all his Poems , in his final edition of<date>1849-50</date>, is not conclusive evidence that he thought them unworthy of preservation , and reproduction . It must be remembered that ‘ The Prelude ’ itself was a posthumous publication ; and also that the fragmentary canto of ‘ The Recluse ’ , entitled “ Home at Grasmere ” — as well as the other canto published in<date>1886</date>, and entitled ( most prosaically ) “ Composed when a probability existed of our being obliged to quit Rydal Mount as a residence ” — were not published by the poet himself . I am of opinion that his omission of the stanzas beginning : Among all lovely things my Love had been , and of the sonnet on his ‘ Voyage down the Rhine ’ , was due to sheer forgetfulness of their existence . Few poets remember all their past , fugitive , productions . At the same time , there are other fragments ,— written when he was experimenting with his theme , and when the inspiration of genius had forsaken him ,— which it is unfortunate that he did not himself destroy . Among the Poems which Wordsworth suppressed , in his final edition , is the Latin translation of ‘ The Somnambulist ’ by his son . This will be republished , more especially as it was included by Wordsworth himself in the second edition of his “ Yarrow Revisited . ” It may be well to mention the ‘ repetitions ’ which are inevitable in this edition , ( 1 ) As already explained , those fragments of ‘ The Recluse ’ — which were issued in all the earlier volumes , and afterwards incorporated in ‘ The Prelude ’ — are printed as they originally appeared . ( 2 ) Short Notes are extracted from Dorothy Wordsworth 's ‘ Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland ’ (<date>1803</date>) , which illustrate the Poems composed during that Tour , while the whole text of that Tour will be printed in full in subsequent volumes . ( 3 ) Other fragments , including the lines beginning , Wisdom and Spirit of the universe , will be printed both by themselves in their chronological place , and in the longer poem of which they form a part , according to the original plan of their author . A detail , perhaps not too trivial to mention , is that , in this edition — at the suggestion of several friends — I have followed the example of Professor Dowden in his Aldine edition , and numbered the lines of almost all the poems — even the sonnets . When I have not done so , the reason will be obvious ; viz . either the structure , or the brevity , of the poem .<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>In giving the date of each poem , I have used the word “ composed , ” rather than “ written , ” very much because Wordsworth himself ,— and his sister , in her Journals — almost invariably use the word “ composed ” ; although he criticised the term as applied to the creation of a poem , as if it were a manufactured article . In his Chronological Table , Mr. Dowden adopts the word “ composed ” ; but , in his edition of the Poems , he has made use of the term ” written . ”<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>No notice ( or almost none ) of misprints in Wordsworth 's own text is taken , in the notes to this edition . Sometimes an error occurred , and was carried on through more than one edition , and corrected in the next : e. g ., in ‘ The Childless Father ’ , the editions of<date>1827</date>,<date>1832</date>, and<date>1836</date>have the line : Fresh springs of green boxwood , not six months before . In the ‘ errata ’ of the edition of<date>1836</date>this is corrected to “ fresh sprigs . ” There are other ‘ errata ’ , which remained in the edition of<date>1849-50</date>, e. g ., in ‘ Rob Roy 's Grave ’ , “ Vools ” for “ Veols , ” and mistakes in quotations from other poets , such as “ invention ” for “ instruction , ” in Wither 's poem on the Daisy . These are corrected without mention . I should perhaps add that , while I have included , amongst the illustrative notes , extracts from Henry Crabb Robinson 's ‘ Diary ’ , etc ., many of them are now published for the first time . These voluminous MSS . of Robinson 's have been re-examined with care ; and the reader who compares the three volumes of the ‘ Diary ’ , etc .— edited by Dr. Sadler — with the extracts now printed from the original MS ., will see where sentences omitted by the original editor have been included . As this edition proceeds , my debt to many — who have been so kind as to put their Wordsworth MSS . and memoranda at my disposal — will be apparent . It is difficult to acknowledge duly my obligation to collectors of autograph Letters — Mr. Morrison , the late Mr. Locker Lampson , the late Mr. Mackay , of the Grange , Trowbridge , and a score of others — but , I may say in general , that the kindness of those who possess Wordsworth MSS . in allowing me to examine them , has been a very genuine evidence of their interest in the Poet , and his work . My special thanks are due to Mr. Gordon Wordsworth , who has , in the kindest manner and for many years , placed everything at my disposal , which could further my labour on his grandfather 's Works . Finally , I wish to express the great debt I owe to the late Mr. J. Dykes Campbell , for many suggestions , and for his unwearied interest in this work ,— which I think was second only to his interest in Coleridge — and also to Mr. W. B. Kinghorn for his valuable assistance in the revision of proof sheets . If there are any desiderata , in reference to Wordsworth — in addition to a new Life , a critical Essay , and such a Bibliography of Criticism as will be adequate for posterity — a ‘ Concordance ’ to his works is one of them . A correspondent once offered to prepare this for me , if I found a publisher : and another has undertaken to compile a volume of ‘ parallel passages ’ from the earlier poets of<country>England</country>, and of the world . A Concordance might very well form part of a volume of ‘ Wordsworthiana ’ , and be a real service to future students of the poet . William Knight . [ Footnote 1 : In addition to my own detection of errors in the text and notes to the editions<date>1882-9</date>, I acknowledge special obligation to the late Vice-Chancellor of the Victoria University , Principal Greenwood , who went over every volume with laborious care , and sent me the result .

     <p>EXTRACT FROM THE CONCLUSION OF A POEM , COMPOSED IN ANTICIPATION OF LEAVING SCHOOL</p>
     <p>Composed 1786 .— Published 1815</p>
     <p>This poem was placed by Wordsworth among his “ Juvenile Pieces . ” The following note was prefixed to that Series , from 1820 to 1832 :</p>
     <p>“ Of the Poems in this class , “ THE EVENING WALK ” and “ DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES ” were first published in 1793 . They are reprinted with some unimportant alterations that were chiefly made very soon after their publication . It would have been easy to amend them , in many passages , both as to sentiment and expression , and I have not been altogether able to resist the temptation : but attempts of this kind are made at the risk of injuring those characteristic features , which , after all , will be regarded as the principal recommendation of juvenile poems . ”</p>
     <p>In 1836 “ unimportant ” was erased before “ alterations ” ; and after “ temptation ” the following was added , “ as will be obvious to the attentive reader , in some instances : these are few , for I am aware that attempts of this kind , ” etc .</p>
     <p>“ The above , which was written some time ago , scarcely applies to the Poem , ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ , as it now stands . The corrections , though numerous , are not , however , such as to prevent its retaining with propriety a place in the class of ‘ Juvenile Pieces . ’ ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">In the editions of 1845 and 1849 , Wordsworth called his “ Juvenile</l>
       <l n="2">Pieces , ” “ Poems written in Youth . ” — Ed .</l>
     </lg>
     <note>“ Dear native regions , ” etc ., 1786 , Hawkshead . The beautiful image with which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while I was resting in a boat along with my companions under the shade of a magnificent row of sycamores , which then extended their branches from the shore of the promontory upon which stands the ancient , and at that time the more picturesque , Hall of Coniston , the Seat of the Le Flemings from very early times . The Poem of which it was the conclusion , was of many hundred lines , and contained thoughts and images , most of which have been dispersed through my other writings .— I . F .</note>
     <p>In the editions 1815 to 1832 , the title given to this poem was ‘ Extract from the conclusion of a Poem , composed upon leaving School ’ . The row of sycamores at Hawkshead , referred to in the Fenwick note , no longer exists .</p>
     <p>In the “ Autobiographical Memoranda , ” dictated by Wordsworth at Rydal Mount in November 1847 , he says , " .... I wrote , while yet a schoolboy , a long poem running upon my own adventures , and the scenery of the county in which I was brought up . The only part of that poem which has been preserved is the conclusion of it , which stands at the beginning of my collected Poems . ” [ A ]</p>
     <p>In the eighth book of ‘ The Prelude ’ , ( lines 468-475 ) , this fragment is introduced , and there Wordsworth tells us that once , when boating on Coniston Lake ( Thurston-mere ) in his boyhood , he entered under a grove of trees on its “ western marge , ” and glided “ along the line of low-roofed water , ” “ as in a cloister . ” He adds ,</p>

      <head>AN EVENING WALK</head>
      <head>ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1787-9 . [ A ] — Published 1793</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ The young Lady to whom this was addressed was my Sister . It was composed at School , and during my first two College vacations . There is not an image in it which I have not observed ; and , now in my seventy-third year , I recollect the time and place , when most of them were noticed . I will confine myself to one instance :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">Waving his hat , the shepherd , from the vale ,</l>
       <l n="2">Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale ,—</l>
       <l n="3">The dog , loud barking , ‘ mid the glittering rocks ,</l>
       <l n="4">Hunts , where his master points , the intercepted flocks .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>I was an eye-witness of this for the first time while crossing the Pass of Dunmail Raise . Upon second thought , I will mention another image :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">And , fronting the bright west , yon oak entwines</l>
       <l n="2">Its darkening boughs and leaves , in stronger lines .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>This is feebly and imperfectly expressed , but I recollect distinctly the very spot where this first struck me . It was on the way between Hawkshead and Ambleside , and gave me extreme pleasure . The moment was important in my poetical history ; for I date from it my consciousness of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been unnoticed by the poets of any age or country , so far as I was acquainted with them ; and I made a resolution to supply in some degree the deficiency . I could not have been at that time above fourteen years of age . The description of the swans , that follows , was taken from the daily opportunities I had of observing their habits , not as confined to the gentleman 's park , but in a state of nature . There were two pairs of them that divided the lake of Esthwaite , and its in-and-out flowing streams , between them , never trespassing a single yard upon each other 's separate domain . They were of the old magnificent species , bearing in beauty and majesty about the same relation to the Thames swan which that does to the goose . It was from the remembrance of those noble creatures , I took , thirty years after , the picture of the swan which I have discarded from the poem of ‘ Dion ’ . [ B ] While I was a schoolboy , the late Mr. Curwen introduced a little fleet of these birds , but of the inferior species , to the lake of Windermere . Their principal home was about his own island ; but they sailed about into remote parts of the lake , and either from real or imagined injury done to the adjoining fields , they were got rid of at the request of the farmers and proprietors , but to the great regret of all who had become attached to them from noticing their beauty and quiet habits . I will conclude my notice of this poem by observing that the plan of it has not been confined to a particular walk , or an individual place ; a proof ( of which I was unconscious at the time ) of my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance . The country is idealised rather than described in any one of its local aspects .— I . F .]</p>
     <p>The title of this poem , as first published in 1793 , was ‘ An Evening Walk . An epistle ; in verse . Addressed to a Young Lady , from the Lakes of the North of England . By W. Wordsworth , B. A ., of St. John 's , Cambridge ’ . Extracts from it were published in all the collected editions of the poems under the general title of “ Juvenile Pieces , ” from 1815 to 1843 ; and , in 1845 and 1849 , of “ Poems written in Youth . ” The following prefatory note to the “ Juvenile Pieces ” occurs in the editions 1820 to 1832 .</p>
     <p>“ They are reprinted with some unimportant alterations that were chiefly made very soon after their publication . It would have been easy to amend them , in many passages , both as to sentiment and expression , and I have not been altogether able to resist the temptation : but attempts of this kind are made at the risk of injuring those characteristic features , which , after all , will be regarded as the principal recommendation of juvenile poems . ”</p>
     <p>To this , Wordsworth added , in 1836 ,</p>
     <p>“ The above , which was written some time ago , scarcely applies to the Poem , ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ , as it now stands . The corrections , though numerous , are not , however , such as to prevent its retaining with propriety a place in the class of ‘ Juvenile Pieces . ’ ”</p>
     <p>In May 1794 Wordsworth wrote to his friend Mathews ,</p>
     <p>“ It was with great reluctance that I sent these two little works into the world in so imperfect a state . But as I had done nothing at the University , I thought these little things might show that I could do something . ”</p>
     <p>Wordsworth 's notes to this poem are printed from the edition of 1793 . Slight variations in the text of these notes in subsequent editions , in the spelling of proper names , and in punctuation , are not noted .— Ed .</p>

     <p>The passage in Clark 's folio volume , ‘ A Survey of the Lakes ’ , etc ., which suggested to Wordsworth the above lines in the ‘ Evening Walk ’ , is to be found in chapter i. of the second book , p. 55 . It gives a weird account of the appearance of horsemen being exercised in troops upon</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Southen-fell side , as seen on the 25th of June 1744 by William</l>
       <l n="2">Lancaster of Blakehills , and a farm servant , David Strichet :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ These visionary horsemen seemed to come from the lowest part of Southen-fell , and became visible just at a place called Knott . They then moved in regular troops along the side of the fell , till they came opposite Blakehills , when they went over the mountain . Then they described a kind of curvilinear path upon the side of the fell , and both these first and last appearances were bounded by the top of the mountain .</p>
     <p>“ Frequently the last , or last but one , in a troop would leave his place , and gallop to the front , and then take the same pace with the rest — a regular swift walk . Thus changes happened to every troop ( for many troops appeared ) and oftener than once or twice , yet not at all times alike .... Nor was this phenomenon seen at Blakehill only , it was seen by every person at every cottage within the distance of a mile . Neither was it confined to a momentary view , for from the time that Strichet first observed it , the appearance must have lasted at least two hours and a half , viz . from half past seven till the night coming on prevented further view . ”</p>
     <p>This interesting optical illusion — which suggests the wonderful island in the Atlantic , seen from the isles of Aran near Galway , alluded to in the ‘ Chorographical description of West , or H-Ier-Connaught ’ , of R. O'Flaherty — was caused by the peculiar angle of the light from the setting sun , the reflection of the water of the Solway , and the refraction of the vapour and clouds above the Solway . These aerial and visionary horsemen were being exercised somewhere above the Kirkcudbright shore . It was not the first time the phenomenon had been seen within historic times , on the same fell-side , and at the same time of year . Canon Rawnsley writes to me ,</p>
     <p>“ I have an idea that the fact that it took place at midsummer eve ( June 27 ) , the eve of the Feast of St. John , upon which occasion the shepherds hereabout used to light bonfires on the hills ( no doubt a relic of the custom of the Beltane fires of old Norse days , perhaps of earlier sun-worship festivals of British times ) , may have had something to do with the naming of the mountain Blencathara of which Southen-fell ( or Shepherd'shYpppHeNfell , as the name implies ) is part . Blencathara , we are told , may mean the Hill of Demons , or the haunted hill . My suggestion is that the old sun-worshippers , who met in midsummer eve on Castrigg at the Druid circle or Donn-ring , saw just the same phenomenon as Strichet and Lancaster saw upon Southen-fell , and hence the name . Nay , perhaps the Druid circle was built where it is , because it was well in view of the Demon Hill . ”</p>

     <note>This title is scarcely correct . It was during a solitary walk on the banks of the Cam that I was first struck with this appearance , and applied it to my own feelings in the manner here expressed , changing the scene to the Thames , near Windsor . This , and the three stanzas of the following poem , ‘ Remembrance of Collins ’ , formed one piece ; but , upon the recommendation of Coleridge , the three last stanzas were separated from the other .— I . F .</note>
     <p>The title of the poem in 1798 , when it consisted of five stanzas , was ‘ Lines written near Richmond , upon the Thames , at Evening ’ . When , in the edition of 1800 , it was divided , the title of the first part was , ‘ Lines written when sailing in a Boat at Evening ’ ; that of the second part was ‘ Lines written near Richmond upon the Thames ’ .</p>
     <p>From 1815 to 1843 , both poems were placed by Wordsworth among those “ of Sentiment and Reflection . ” In 1845 they were transferred to “ Poems written in Youth . ” — Ed .</p>

      <head>DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES TAKEN DURING A PEDESTRIAN TOUR AMONG THE ALPS</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1791-2 . [ A ] — Published 1793</l>
     </lg>
     <p>TO THE REV . ROBERT JONES , FELLOW OF ST. JOHN 'S COLLEGE , CAMBRIDGE</p>
     <p>DEAR SIR , [ B ] — However desirous I might have been of giving you proofs of the high place you hold in my esteem , I should have been cautious of wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you , had not the circumstance of our having been companions among the Alps , seemed to give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples which your modesty might otherwise have suggested . [ C ]</p>
     <p>In inscribing this little work to you , I consult my heart . You know well how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a post-chaise , and two travellers plodding slowly along the road , side by side , each with his little knapsack of necessaries upon his shoulders . How much more of heart between the two latter !</p>
     <p>I am happy in being conscious that I shall have one reader who will approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret . You they must certainly interest , in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of melancholy . You will meet with few images without recollecting the spot where we observed them together ; consequently , whatever is feeble in my design , or spiritless in my colouring , will be amply supplied by your own memory .</p>
     <p>With still greater propriety I might have inscribed to you a description of some of the features of your native mountains , through which we have wandered together , in the same manner , with so much pleasure . But the sea-sunsets , which give such splendour to the vale of Clwyd , Snowdon , the chair of Idris , the quiet village of Bethgelert , Menai and her Druids , the Alpine steeps of the Conway , and the still more interesting windings of the wizard stream of the Dee , remain yet untouched . Apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects , I cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly assuring you with how much affection and esteem</p>
     <p>I am , dear Sir , Most sincerely yours , W. WORDSWORTH .</p>
     <p>LONDON , 1793 .</p>
     <note>Much the greatest part of this poem was composed during my walks upon the banks of the Loire , in the years 1791 , 1792 . I will only notice that the description of the valley filled with mist , beginning — ‘ In solemn shapes ’ — was taken from that beautiful region of which the principal features are Lungarn and Sarnen . Nothing that I ever saw in Nature left a more delightful impression on my mind than that which I have attempted , alas , how feebly ! to convey to others in these lines . Those two lakes have always interested me especially , from bearing in their size and other features , a resemblance to those of the North of England . It is much to be deplored that a district so beautiful should be so unhealthy as it is .— I . F .</note>
     <p>As the original text of the ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ is printed in Appendix I . ( p. 309 ) to this volume — with all the notes to that edition of 1793 — it is not quoted in the footnotes to the final text in the pages which follow , except in cases which will justify themselves . Therefore the various readings which follow begin with the edition of 1815 , which was , however , a mere fragment of the original text . Almost the whole of the poem of 1793 was reproduced in 1820 , but there were many alterations of the text in that edition , and in those of 1827 , 1832 , 1836 and 1845 . Wordsworth 's own footnotes here reproduced are those which he retained in the edition of 1849 .</p>
     <p>‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ was ranked among the “ Juvenile Pieces ” from 1815 onwards : but in 1836 it was put in a class by itself along with the ‘ Female Vagrant ’ . [ D ] — Ed .</p>

      <head>GUILT AND SORROW ; OR , INCIDENTS UPON SALISBURY PLAIN</head>
      <head>Composed 1791-4 .— Published as ‘ The Female Vagrant ’ in “ Lyrical Ballads ” in 1798 , and as ‘ Guilt and Sorrow ’ in the “ Poems of Early and Late Years , ” and in “ Poems written in Youth , ” in 1845 , and onward .</head>
       <l n="1">ADVERTISEMENT , PREFIXED TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS POEM , PUBLISHED</l>
       <l n="2">IN 1842 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Not less than one-third of the following poem , though it has from time to time been altered in the expression , was published so far back as the year 1798 , under the title of ‘ The Female Vagrant ’ . The extract is of such length that an apology seems to be required for reprinting it here ; but it was necessary to restore it to its original position , or the rest would have been unintelligible . The whole was written before the close of the year 1794 , and I will detail , rather as matter of literary biography than for any other reason , the circumstances under which it was produced .</p>
     <p>During the latter part of the summer of 1793 , having passed a month in the Isle of Wight , in view of the fleet which was then preparing for sea off Portsmouth at the commencement of the war , I left the place with melancholy forebodings . The American war was still fresh in memory . The struggle which was beginning , and which many thought would be brought to a speedy close by the irresistible arms of Great Britain being added to those of the allies , I was assured in my own mind would be of long continuance , and productive of distress and misery beyond all possible calculation . This conviction was pressed upon me by having been a witness , during a long residence in revolutionary France , of the spirit which prevailed in that country . After leaving the Isle of Wight , I spent two [ A ] days in wandering on foot over Salisbury Plain , which , though cultivation was then widely spread through parts of it , had upon the whole a still more impressive appearance than it now retains .</p>
     <p>The monuments and traces of antiquity , scattered in abundance over that region , led me unavoidably to compare what we know or guess of those remote times with certain aspects of modern society , and with calamities , principally those consequent upon war , to which , more than other classes of men , the poor are subject . In those reflections , joined with some particular facts that had come to my knowledge , the following stanzas originated .</p>
     <p>In conclusion , to obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are well acquainted with Salisbury Plain , it may be proper to say , that of the features described as belonging to it , one or two are taken from other desolate parts of England .</p>
     <note>Unwilling to be unnecessarily particular , I have assigned this poem to the dates 1793 and ‘ 94 ; but , in fact , much of the Female Vagrant 's story was composed at least two years before . All that relates to her sufferings as a sailor 's wife in America , and her condition of mind during her voyage home , were faithfully taken from the report made to me of her own case by a friend who had been subjected to the same trials , and affected in the same way . Mr. Coleridge , when I first became acquainted with him , was so much impressed with this poem , that it would have encouraged me to publish the whole as it then stood ; but the mariner 's fate appeared to me so tragical , as to require a treatment more subdued , and yet more strictly applicable in expression , than I had at first given to it . This fault was corrected nearly sixty years afterwards , when I determined to publish the whole . It may be worth while to remark , that , though the incidents of this attempt do only in a small degree produce each other , and it deviates accordingly from the general rule by which narrative pieces ought to be governed , it is not , therefore , wanting in continuous hold upon the mind , or in unity , which is effected by the identity of moral interest that places the two personages upon the same footing in the reader 's sympathies . My ramble over many parts of Salisbury Plain put me , as mentioned in the preface , upon writing this poem , and left upon my mind imaginative impressions , the force of which I have felt to this day . From that district I proceeded to Bath , Bristol , and so on to the banks of the Wye ; where I took again to travelling on foot . In remembrance of that part of my journey , which was in ‘ 93 , I began the verses ,— ‘ Five years have passed , ’ etc .— I . F .</note>
     <p>The foregoing is the Fenwick note to ‘ Guilt and Sorrow ’ . The note to ‘ The Female Vagrant ’ ,— which was the title under which one-third of the longer poem appeared in all the complete editions prior to 1845 — is as follows .— Ed .</p>
     <note>I find the date of this is placed in 1792 , in contradiction , by mistake , to what I have asserted in ‘ Guilt and Sorrow ’ . The correct date is 1793-4 . The chief incidents of it , more particularly her description of her feelings on the Atlantic , are taken from life .— I . F .</note>
     <p>In 1798 there were thirty stanzas in this poem ; in 1802 , twenty-six ; in 1815 , fourteen ; in 1820 , twenty-five . Stanzas I. to XXII ., XXXV . to XXXVII ., and LI . to LXXIV . occur only in the collected edition of 1842 , vol . vii . ( also published as “ Poems , chiefly of Early and Late Years ” ) , and in subsequent editions . Wordsworth placed ‘ The Female Vagrant ’ among his “ Juvenile Pieces ” from 1815 to 1832 . In 1836 , he included it along with ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ in his Table of Contents ; [ B ] but as he numbered it IV . in the text — the other poems belonging to the “ Juvenile Pieces ” being numbered I. II . and III .— it is clear that he meant it to remain in that class . The “ Poems written in Youth , ” of the edition of 1845 , include many others in addition to the “ Juvenile Pieces ” of editions 1815 to 1836 .— Ed .</p>

      <head>LINES LEFT UPON A SEAT IN A YEW-TREE , WHICH STANDS NEAR THE LAKE OF ESTHWAITE , ON A DESOLATE PART OF THE SHORE , COMMANDING [ A ] A BEAUTIFUL PROSPECT</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1795 .— Published 1798</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Composed in part at school at Hawkshead . The tree has disappeared , and the slip of Common on which it stood , that ran parallel to the lake , and lay open to it , has long been enclosed ; so that the road has lost much of its attraction . This spot was my favourite walk in the evenings during the latter part of my school-time . The individual whose habits and character are here given , was a gentleman of the neighbourhood , a man of talent and learning , who had been educated at one of our Universities , and returned to pass his time in seclusion on his own estate . He died a bachelor in middle age . Induced by the beauty of the prospect , he built a small summer-house , on the rocks above the peninsula on which the Ferry House [ B ] stands . This property afterwards passed into the hands of the late Mr. Curwen . The site was long ago pointed out by Mr. West , in his ‘ Guide ’ , as the pride of the Lakes , and now goes by the name of “ The Station . ” So much used I to be delighted with the view from it , while a little boy , that some years before the first pleasure house was built , I led thither from Hawkshead a youngster about my own age , an Irish boy , who was a servant to an itinerant conjurer . My notion was to witness the pleasure I expected the boy would receive from the prospect of the islands below and the intermingling water . I was not disappointed ; and I hope the fact , insignificant as it may appear to some , may be thought worthy of note by others who may cast their eye over these notes .— I . F .</note>

       <l n="34">On the more distant scene ,— how lovely ‘ tis</l>

       <l n="41">The world , and human life ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>appeared a scene</l>
       <l n="42">Of kindred loveliness : then he would sigh ,</l>
       <l n="43">Inly disturbed , to think<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>that others felt</l>
       <l n="44">What he must never feel : and so , lost Man !</l>

       <l n="46">Till his eye streamed with tears . In this deep vale</l>

       <l n="50">Stranger ! henceforth be warned ; and know that pride , 50</l>
       <l n="51">Howe'er disguised in its own majesty ,</l>
       <l n="52">Is littleness ; that he who feels contempt</l>
       <l n="53">For any living thing , hath faculties</l>
       <l n="54">Which he has never used ; that thought with him</l>
       <l n="55">Is in its infancy . The man whose eye 55</l>

       <l n="57">The least of Nature 's works , one who might move</l>

       <l n="59">Unlawful , ever . O be wiser , Thou !</l>
       <l n="60">Instructed that true knowledge leads to love ; 60</l>
       <l n="61">True dignity abides with him alone</l>
       <l n="62">Who , in the silent hour of inward thought ,</l>
       <l n="63">Can still suspect , and still revere himself ,</l>
       <l n="64">In lowliness of heart .</l>

     <p>The place where this Yew-tree stood may be found without difficulty . It was about three-quarters of a mile from Hawkshead , on the eastern shore of the lake , a little to the left above the present highway , as one goes towards Sawrey . Mr . Bowman , the son of Wordsworth 's last teacher at the grammar-school of Hawkshead , told me that it stood about forty yards nearer the village than the yew which is now on the roadside , and is sometimes called “ Wordsworth 's Yew . ” In the poet 's school-days the road passed right through the unenclosed common , and the tree was a conspicuous object . It was removed , he says , owing to the popular belief that its leaves were poisonous , and might injure the cattle grazing in the common . The present tree is erroneously called “ Wordsworth 's Yew . ” Its proximity to the place where the tree of the poem stood has given rise to the local tradition .— Ed .</p>

      <head>THE BORDERERS</head>
      <head>A TRAGEDY</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1795-6 .— Published 1842</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Readers already acquainted with my Poems will recognise , in the following composition , some eight or ten lines , [ A ] which I have not scrupled to retain in the places where they originally stood . It is proper however to add , that they would not have been used elsewhere , if I had foreseen the time when I might be induced to publish this Tragedy .</p>
     <p>February 28 , 1842 . [ B ]</p>
     <p>This Dramatic Piece , as noted in its title-page , was composed in 1795-6 . It lay nearly from that time till within the last two or three months unregarded among my papers , without being mentioned even to my most intimate friends . Having , however , impressions upon my mind which made me unwilling to destroy the MS ., I determined to undertake the responsibility of publishing it during my own life , rather than impose upon my successors the task of deciding its fate . Accordingly it has been revised with some care ; but , as it was at first written , and is now published , without any view to its exhibition upon the stage , not the slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story , or the composition of the characters ; above all , in respect to the two leading Persons of the Drama , I felt no inducement to make any change . The study of human nature suggests this awful truth , that , as in the trials to which life subjects us , sin and crime are apt to start from their very opposite qualities , so there are no limits to the hardening of the heart , and the perversion of the understanding to which they may carry their slaves . During my long residence in France , while the Revolution was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness , I had frequent opportunities of being an eye-witness of this process , and it was while that knowledge was fresh upon my memory , that the Tragedy of ‘ The Borderers ’ was composed . [ C ]</p>
     <note>Of this dramatic work I have little to say in addition to the short printed note which will be found attached to it . It was composed at Racedown , in Dorset , during the latter part of the year 1795 , and in the following year . Had it been the work of a later period of life , it would have been different in some respects from what it is now . The plot would have been something more complex , and a greater variety of characters introduced to relieve the mind from the pressure of incidents so mournful . The manners also would have been more attended to . My care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the characters , and the position in which the persons in the drama stood relatively to each other , that the reader ( for I had then no thought of the stage ) might be moved , and to a degree instructed , by lights penetrating somewhat into the depths of our nature . In this endeavour , I cannot think , upon a very late review , that I have failed . As to the scene and period of action , little more was required for my purpose than the absence of established law and government , so that the agents might be at liberty to act on their own impulses . Nevertheless , I do remember , that having a wish to colour the manners in some degree from local history more than my knowledge enabled me to do , I read Redpath 's ‘ History of the Borders ’ , but found there nothing to my purpose . I once made an observation to Sir W. Scott , in which he concurred , that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book could be written on such a subject . Much about the same time , but little after , Coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of ‘ Remorse ’ ; and it happened that soon after , through one of the Mr. Poole 's , Mr. Knight , the actor , heard that we had been engaged in writing plays , and upon his suggestion , mine was curtailed , and I believe Coleridge 's also , was offered to Mr. Harris , manager of Covent Garden . For myself , I had no hope , nor even a wish ( though a successful play would in the then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of good fortune ) , that he should accept my performance ; so that I incurred no disappointment when the piece was judiciously returned as not calculated for the stage . In this judgment I entirely concurred : and had it been otherwise , it was so natural for me to shrink from public notice , that any hope I might have had of success would not have reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition . Mr. C .' s play was , as is well known , brought forward several years after , through the kindness of Mr. Sheridan . In conclusion , I may observe , that while I was composing this play , I wrote a short essay , illustrative of that constitution and those tendencies of human nature which make the apparently ‘ motiveless ’ actions of bad men intelligible to careful observers . This was partly done with reference to the character of Oswald , and his persevering endeavour to lead the man he disliked into so heinous a crime ; but still more to preserve in my distinct remembrance , what I had observed of transitions in character , and the reflections I had been led to make , during the time I was a witness of the changes through which the French Revolution passed .— I .

       <l n="160">In June 1797 Coleridge wrote to his friend Cottle :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ W. has written a tragedy himself . I speak with heart-felt sincerity , and , I think , unblinded judgment , when I tell you that I feel myself a little man by his side , and yet I do not think myself a less man than I formerly thought myself . His drama is absolutely wonderful . You know I do not commonly speak in such abrupt and unmingled phrases , and therefore will the more readily believe me . There are in the piece those profound touches of the human heart which I find three or four times in the ‘ Robbers ’ of Schiller , and often in Shakspeare ; but in W. there are no inequalities . ”</p>
     <p>On August 6 , 1800 , Charles Lamb wrote to Coleridge :</p>
     <p>“ I would pay five-and-forty thousand carriages to read W .' s tragedy , of which I have heard so much and seen so little . ” Shortly afterwards , August 26 , he wrote to Coleridge : “ I have a sort of a recollection that somebody , I think you , promised me a sight of Wordsworth 's tragedy . I shall be very glad of it just now , for I have got Manning with me , and should like to read it with him . But this , I confess , is a refinement . Under any circumstances , alone , in Cold-Bath Prison , or in the desert island , just when Prospero and his crew had set off , with Caliban in a cage , to Milan , it would be a treat to me to read that play . Manning has read it , so has Lloyd , and all Lloyd 's family ; but I could not get him to betray his trust by giving me a sight of it . Lloyd is sadly deficient in some of those virtuous vices . ” — Ed .</p>

     <p>Placed by Wordsworth among his “ Poems of the Imagination . ” — Ed .</p>
     <p>The preceding Fenwick note to this poem is manifestly inaccurate as to date , since the poem is printed in the “ Lyrical Ballads ” of 1800 . In the edition of 1836 the date of composition is given as 1797 , and this date is followed by Mr. Carter , the editor of 1857 . Miss Wordsworth 's Journal gives no date ; and , as the Fenwick note is certainly incorrect — and the poem must have been written before the edition of 1800 came out — it seems best to trust to the date sanctioned by Wordsworth himself in 1836 , and followed by his literary executor in 1857 . I think it probable that the poem was written during the short visit which Wordsworth and his sister paid to their brother Richard in London in 1797 , when he tried to get his tragedy , ‘ The Borderers ’ , brought on the stage . The title of the poem from 1800 to 1805 was ‘ Poor Susan ’ .— Ed .</p>

     <p>“ Susan stood for the representative of poor ‘ Rus in urbe . ’ There was quite enough to stamp the moral of the thing never to be forgotten ; ‘ bright volumes of vapour , ’ etc . The last verse of Susan was to be got rid of , at all events . It threw a kind of dubiety upon Susan 's moral conduct . Susan is a servant maid . I see her trundling her mop , and contemplating the whirling phenomenon through blurred optics ; but to term her ‘ a poor outcast ’ seems as much as to say that poor Susan was no better than she should be , which I trust was not what you meant to express . ”</p>

     <p>“ Went to Poole 's after tea . The sky spread over with one continuous cloud , whitened by the light of the moon , which , though her dim shape was seen , did not throw forth so strong a light as to chequer the earth with shadows . At once the clouds seemed to cleave asunder , and lift her in the centre of a black-blue vault . She sailed along , followed by multitudes of stars , small , and bright , and sharp ; their brightness seemed concentrated . ”</p>

       <l n="3">somewhat remarkable . The little girl who is the heroine , I met within</l>
       <l n="4">the area of Goodrich Castle in the year 1793 . Having left the Isle of</l>
       <l n="5">Wight , and crost Salisbury Plain , as mentioned in the preface to</l>
       <l n="6">‘ Guilt and Sorrow ’ , I proceeded by Bristol up the Wye , and so on to N .</l>
       <l n="7">Wales to the Vale of Clwydd , where I spent my summer under the roof of</l>
       <l n="8">the father of my friend , Robert Jones .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>In reference to this poem , I will here mention one of the most remarkable facts in my own poetic history , and that of Mr. Coleridge . In the spring of the year 1798 , he , my sister , and myself , started from Alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon , with a view to visit Linton and the Valley of Stones near it ; and as our united funds were very small , we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a poem , to be sent to the ‘ New Monthly Magazine ’ , set up by Philips , the bookseller , and edited by Dr. Aikin . Accordingly we set off , and proceeded along the Quantock Hills , towards Watchet ; and in the course of this walk was planned the poem of ‘ The Ancient Mariner ’ , founded on a dream , as Mr. Coleridge said , of his friend Mr. Cruikshank . Much the greatest part of the story was Mr. Coleridge 's invention ; but certain parts I myself suggested : for example , some crime was to be committed which should bring upon the Old Navigator , as Coleridge afterwards delighted to call him , the spectral persecution , as a consequence of that crime , and his own wanderings . I had been reading in Shelvocke 's ‘ Voyages ’ , a day or two before , that , while doubling Cape Horn , they frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude , the largest sort of sea-fowl , some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet . ‘ Suppose , ’ said I , ‘ you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the South Sea , and that the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime . ’ The incident was thought fit for the purpose , and adopted accordingly . I also suggested the navigation of the ship by the dead men , but do not recollect that I had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem . The gloss with which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of us at the time ; at least not a hint of it was given to me , and I have no doubt it was a gratuitous after-thought . We began the composition together , on that to me memorable evening : I furnished two or three lines at the beginning of the poem , in particular —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">And listen 'd like a three years ’ child ;</l>
       <l n="2">The Mariner had his will .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>These trifling contributions , all but one ( which Mr. C. has with unnecessary scrupulosity recorded ) , slipt out of his mind , as well they might . As we endeavoured to proceed conjointly ( I speak of the same evening ) , our respective manners proved so widely different , that it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but separate from an undertaking upon which I could only have been a clog . We returned after a few days from a delightful tour , of which I have many pleasant , and some of them droll enough , recollections . We returned by Dulverton to Alfoxden . ‘ The Ancient Mariner ’ grew and grew till it became too important for our first object , which was limited to our expectation of five pounds ; and we began to talk of a volume which was to consist , as Mr. Coleridge has told the world , of Poems chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life , but looked at , as much as might be , through an imaginative medium . Accordingly I wrote ‘ The Idiot Boy ’ , ‘ Her eyes are wild ’ , etc ., ‘ We are Seven ’ , ‘ The Thorn ’ , and some others . To return to ‘ We are Seven ’ , the piece that called forth this note , I composed it while walking in the grove at Alfoxden . My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate , that while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first , having begun with the last line . When it was all but finished , I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my sister , and said , “ A prefatory stanza must be added , and I should sit down to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task was finished . ” I mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed , and Coleridge immediately threw off the stanza , thus ;</p>
     <p>A little child , dear brother Jem ,</p>
     <p>I objected to the rhyme , ‘ dear brother Jem , ’ as being ludicrous ; but we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend James Tobin 's name , who was familiarly called Jem . He was the brother of the dramatist ; and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice . The said Jem got a sight of the “ Lyrical Ballads ” as it was going through the press at Bristol , during which time I was residing in that city . One evening he came to me with a grave face , and said , “ Wordsworth , I have seen the volume that Coleridge and you are about to publish . There is one poem in it which I earnestly entreat you will cancel , for , if published , it will make you everlastingly ridiculous . ” I answered , that I felt much obliged by the interest he took in my good name as a writer , and begged to know what was the unfortunate piece he alluded to . He said , ‘ It is called ‘ We are Seven ’ . ' ‘ Nay , ’ said I , ‘ that shall take its chance , however ’ ; and he left me in despair . I have only to add , that in the spring [ A ] of 1841 , I revisited Goodrich Castle , not having seen that part of the Wye since I met the little girl there in 1793 . It would have given me greater pleasure to have found in the neighbouring hamlet traces of one who had interested me so much , but that was impossible , as unfortunately I did not even know her name . The ruin , from its position and features , is a most impressive object . I could not but deeply regret that its solemnity was impaired by a fantastic new Castle set up on a projection of the same ridge , as if to show how far modern art can go in surpassing all that could be done by antiquity and nature with their united graces , remembrances , and associations . I could have almost wished for power , so much the contrast vexed me , to blow away Sir —— Meyrick 's impertinent structure and all the fopperies it contains .— I . F .]</p>

     <note>This was suggested in front of Alfoxden . The boy was a son of my friend , Basil Montagu , who had been two or three years under our care . The name of Kilve is from a village on the Bristol Channel , about a mile from Alfoxden ; and the name of Liswyn Farm was taken from a beautiful spot on the Wye , where Mr. Coleridge , my sister , and I had been visiting the famous John Thelwall , who had taken refuge from politics , after a trial for high treason , with a view to bring up his family by the profits of agriculture , which proved as unfortunate a speculation as that he had fled from . Coleridge and he had both been public lecturers ; Coleridge mingling , with his politics , Theology , from which the other elocutionist abstained , unless it was for the sake of a sneer . This quondam community of public employment induced Thelwall to visit Coleridge at Nether Stowey , where he fell in my way . He really was a man of extraordinary talent , an affectionate husband , and a good father . Though brought up in the city , on a tailor 's board , he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural objects . I remember once , when Coleridge , he , and I were seated together upon the turf , on the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of the most beautiful glen of Alfoxden , Coleridge exclaimed , ‘ This is a place to reconcile one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide world . ’ ‘ Nay , ’ said Thelwall , ‘ to make one forget them altogether . ’ The visit of this man to Coleridge was , as I believe Coleridge has related , the occasion of a spy being sent by Government to watch our proceedings ; which were , I can say with truth , such as the world at large would have thought ludicrously harmless .— I .

If little Montagu ever did compare Kilve and Liswyn Farm , he must have done so after he left Alfoxden . The scene is laid at Liswyn , and if the poem was written at Alfoxden , before the party visited Liswyn , the supposed reply was invented to a supposed question which might be put to the child when he got to Liswyn .

       <l n="2">In the editions of 1800-1805 , Wordsworth added the following note to</l>
       <l n="3">this poem :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ This Poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory Poem , which I have been prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a mood when it was probable that I should write it well .— The character which I have here introduced speaking is sufficiently common . The Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it , if he has ever known a man , a Captain of a small trading vessel for example , who being past the middle age of life , had retired upon an annuity or small independent income to some village or country town of which he was not a native , or in which he had not been accustomed to live . Such men having little to do become credulous and talkative from indolence ; and from the same cause , and other predisposing causes by which it is probable that such men may have been affected , they are prone to superstition . On which account it appeared to me proper to select a character like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which superstition acts upon the mind . Superstitious men are almost always men of slow faculties and deep feelings ; their minds are not loose but adhesive ; they have a reasonable share of imagination , by which word I mean the faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple elements ; but they are utterly destitute of fancy , the power by which pleasure and surprise are excited by sudden varieties of situation and by accumulated imagery .</p>
     <p>“ It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men cleave to the same ideas ; and to follow the turns of passion , always different , yet not palpably different , by which their conversation is swayed . I had two objects to attain ; first , to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the character that should describe it , secondly , while I adhered to the style in which such persons describe , to take care that words , which in their minds are impregnated with passion , should likewise convey passion to Readers who are not accustomed to sympathize with men feeling in that manner or using such language . It seemed to me that this might be done by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre . It was necessary that the Poem , to be natural , should in reality move slowly ; yet I hoped , that , by the aid of the metre , to those who should at all enter into the spirit of the Poem , it would appear to move quickly . The Reader will have the kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible that an introductory Poem is necessary to give this Poem its full effect .</p>
     <p>“ Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words closely connected with ‘ The Thorn ’ and many other Poems in these Volumes . There is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated without tautology ; this is a great error : virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different words when the meaning is exactly the same . Words , a Poet 's words more particularly , ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not measured by the space which they occupy upon paper . For the Reader cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is passion : it is the history or science of feelings : now every man must know that an attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers , or the deficiencies of language . During such efforts there will be a craving in the mind , and as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will cling to the same words , or words of the same character . There are also various other reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind . Among the chief of these reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words , not only as symbols of the passion , but as ‘ things ’ , active and efficient , which are of themselves part of the passion . And further , from a spirit of fondness , exultation , and gratitude , the mind luxuriates in the repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate its feelings . The truth of these remarks might be shown by innumerable passages from the Bible and from the impassioned poetry of every nation .</p>
     <p>Awake , awake , Deborah ! awake , awake , utter a song : Arise Barak , and lead captivity captive , thou Son of Abinoam .</p>
     <p>At her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed there he fell down dead .</p>

     <p>“ The poem of ‘ The Thorn ’ , as the reader will soon discover , is not supposed to be spoken in the author 's own person : the character of the loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the story . ”</p>
     <p>W. W. Advertisement to “ Lyrical Ballads , ” 1798 .</p>
     <note>Alfoxden , 1798 . Arose out of my observing , on the ridge of Quantock Hill , on a stormy day , a thorn , which I had often past in calm and bright weather , without noticing it . I said to myself , “ Cannot I by some invention do as much to make this Thorn permanently as an impressive object as the storm has made it to my eyes at this moment ? ” I began the poem accordingly , and composed it with great rapidity . Sir George Beaumont painted a picture from it , which Wilkie thought his best . He gave it me : though when he saw it several times at Rydal Mount afterwards , he said , ‘ I could make a better , and would like to paint the same subject over again . ’ The sky in this picture is nobly done , but it reminds one too much of Wilson . The only fault , however , of any consequence is the female figure , which is too old and decrepit for one likely to frequent an eminence on such a call .— I . F .</note>

     <p>“ Are ye sure ye ken the way ye are taking us ? ” said Jeanie , who began to imagine that she was getting deeper into the woods , and more remote from the highroad .</p>
     <p>“ Do I ken the road ? Wasna I mony a day living here , and what for shouldna I ken the road ? I might hae forgotten , too , for it was afore my accident ; but there are some things ane can never forget , let them try it as muckle as they like . ”</p>
     <p>By this time they had gained the deepest part of a patch of woodland . The trees were a little separated from each other , and at the foot of one of them , a beautiful poplar , was a hillock of moss , such as the poet of Grasmere has described in the motto to our chapter . So soon as she arrived at this spot , Madge Wildfire , joining her hands above her head , with a loud scream that resembled laughter , flung herself all at once upon the spot , and remained there lying motionless .</p>
     <p>Jeanie 's first idea was to take the opportunity of flight ; but her desire to escape yielded for a moment to apprehension for the poor insane being , who , she thought , might perish for want of relief . With an effort , which , in her circumstances , might be termed heroic , she stooped down , spoke in a soothing tone , and tried to raise up the forlorn creature . She effected this with difficulty , and as she placed her against the tree in a sitting posture , she observed with surprise , that her complexion , usually florid , was now deadly pale , and that her face was bathed in tears . Notwithstanding her own extreme danger , Jeanie was affected by the situation of her companion ; and the rather that , through the whole train of her wavering and inconsistent state of mind and line of conduct , she discerned a general colour of kindness towards herself , for which she felt gratitude .</p>
     <p>“ Let me alane !— let me alane ! ” said the poor young woman , as her paroxysm of sorrow began to abate . “ Let me alane ; it does me good to weep . I canna shed tears but maybe anes or twice a-year , and I aye come to wet this turf with them , that the flowers may grow fair , and the grass may be green . ”</p>
     <p>“ But what is the matter with you ? ” said Jeanie . “ Why do you weep so bitterly ? ”</p>
     <p>“ There 's matter enow , ” replied the lunatic ; “ mair than ae puir mind can bear , I trow . Stay a bit , and I 'll tell you a ’ about it ; for I like ye , Jeanie Deans ; a'body spoke weel about ye when we lived in the Pleasaunts . And I mind aye the drink o ’ milk ye gae me yon day , when I had been on Arthur 's Seat for four-and-twenty hours , looking for the ship that somebody was sailing in . ”</p>

     </lg>
     <p>See Erasmus Darwin 's ‘ Zoönomia ’ , vol . iv . pp . 68-69 , ed . 1801 . It is the story of a man named Tullis , narrated by an Italian , Signer L. Storgosi , in a work called ‘ Il Narratore Italiano ’ .</p>
     <p>“ I received good information of the truth of the following case , which was published a few years ago in the newspapers . A young farmer in Warwickshire , finding his hedges broke , and the sticks carried away during a frosty season , determined to watch for the thief . He lay many cold hours under a haystack , and at length an old woman , like a witch in a play , approached , and began to pull up the hedge ; he waited till she had tied up her bundle of sticks , and was carrying them off , that he might convict her of the theft , and then springing from his concealment , he seized his prey with violent threats . After some altercation , in which her load was left upon the ground , she kneeled upon her bundle of sticks , and raising her arms to Heaven , beneath the bright moon then at the full , spoke to the farmer , already shivering with cold , ‘ Heaven grant that thou mayest never know again the blessing to be warm . ’ He complained of cold all the next day , and wore an upper coat , and in a few days another , and in a fortnight took to his bed , always saying nothing made him warm ; he covered himself with many blankets , and had a sieve over his face as he lay ; and from this one insane idea he kept his bed above twenty years for fear of the cold air , till at length he died . ”</p>
     <p>In the “ Advertisement ” to the first edition of “ Lyrical Ballads , ” Wordsworth says , “ The tale of ‘ Goody Blake and Harry Gill ’ is founded on a well-authenticated fact which happened in Warwickshire . ”</p>
     <p>The following curious letter appeared in the ‘ Ipswich Magazine ’ of April 1799 :</p>
     <p>“ IPSWICH , April 2 , 1799 .</p>
     <p>“ To the Editors of the ‘ Ipswich Magazine ’ .</p>
     <p>“ GENTLEMEN — The scarcity of Coal at this time , and the piercing cold of the weather , cannot fail to be some apology for the depredations daily committed on the hedges in the neighbourhood . If ever it be permitted , it ought in the present season . Should there be any Farmer more rigorous than the rest , let him attend to the poetical story inserted in page 118 of this Magazine , and tremble at the fate of Farmer Gill , who was about to prosecute a poor old woman for a similar offence . The thing is a fact , and told by one of the first physicians of the present day , as having happened in the south of England , ‘ and which has , a short time since ’ , been turned by a lyric poet into that excellent ballad . ”</p>

      <head>SIMON LEE , THE OLD HUNTSMAN ;</head>
      <head>WITH AN INCIDENT IN WHICH HE WAS CONCERNED</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1798 .— Published 1798 .</l>
     </lg>
     <note>This old man had been huntsman to the Squires of Alfoxden , which , at the time we occupied it , belonged to a minor . The old man 's cottage stood upon the Common , a little way from the entrance to Alfoxden Park . But it had disappeared . Many other changes had taken place in the adjoining village , which I could not but notice with a regret more natural than well-considered . Improvements but rarely appear such to those who , after long intervals of time , revisit places they have had much pleasure in . It is unnecessary to add , the fact was as mentioned in the poem ; and I have , after an interval of forty-five years , the image of the old man as fresh before my eyes as if I had seen him yesterday . The expression when the hounds were out , ‘ I dearly love their voice , ’ was word for word from his own lips .— I . F .</note>

      <head>LINES WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1798 .— Published 1798 .</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Actually composed while I was sitting by the side of the brook that runs down from the ‘ Comb ’ , in which stands the village of Alford , through the grounds of Alfoxden . It was a chosen resort of mine . The brook ran down a sloping rock , so as to make a waterfall , considerable for that county ; and across the pool below had fallen a tree — an ash if I rightly remember — from which rose perpendicularly , boughs in search of the light intercepted by the deep shade above . The boughs bore leaves of green , that for want of sunshine had faded into almost lily-white ; and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy , which waved gently in the breeze , that might , poetically speaking , be called the breath of the waterfall . This motion varied of course in proportion to the power of water in the brook . When , with dear friends , I revisited this spot , after an interval of more than forty years , [ A ] this interesting feature of the scene was gone . To the owner of the place I could not but regret that the beauty of this retired part of the grounds had not tempted him to make it more accessible by a path , not broad or obtrusive , but sufficient for persons who love such scenes to creep along without difficulty .— I .

     <p>This Alfoxden dell , once known locally as “ The Mare 's Pool , ” was a trysting-place of Wordsworth , Coleridge , and their friends . Coleridge thus describes it , in his poem beginning “ This Lime-Tree Bower , my Prison , ” addressed to Charles Lamb :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The roaring dell , o'erhYpppHeNwooded , narrow , deep ,</l>
       <l n="2">And only speckled by the midday sun ;</l>
       <l n="3">Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock</l>
       <l n="4">Flings arching like a bridge ;— that branchless ash ,</l>
       <l n="5">Unsunn 'd and damp , whose few poor yellow leaves</l>
       <l n="6">Ne'er tremble in the gale , yet tremble still ,</l>
       <l n="7">Fanned by the waterfall !</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Of all the localities around Alfoxden , this grove is the one chiefly associated with Wordsworth . There was no path to the waterfall , as suggested by the Poet to the owner of the place , in 1840 ; but , in 1880 , I found the “ natural sylvan bridge ” restored . An ash tree , having fallen across the glen , reproduced the scene exactly as it is described in the Fenwick note .— Ed .</p>

      <head>TO MY SISTER</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1798 .— Published 1798 .</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Composed in front of Alfoxden House . My little boy-messenger on this occasion was the son of Basil Montagu . The larch mentioned in the first stanza was standing when I revisited the place in May 1841 , more than forty years after . I was disappointed that it had not improved in appearance as to size , nor had it acquired anything of the majesty of age , which , even though less perhaps than any other tree , the larch sometimes does . A few score yards from this tree , grew , when we inhabited Alfoxden , one of the most remarkable beech-trees ever seen . The ground sloped both towards and from it . It was of immense size , and threw out arms that struck into the soil , like those of the banyan-tree , and rose again from it . Two of the branches thus inserted themselves twice , which gave to each the appearance of a serpent moving along by gathering itself up in folds . One of the large boughs of this tree had been torn off by the wind before we left Alfoxden , but five remained . In 1841 we could barely find the spot where the tree had stood . So remarkable a production of nature could not have been wilfully destroyed .— I . F .</note>
     <p>In the editions 1798 to 1815 the title of this poem was , ‘ Lines written at a small distance from my House , and sent by my little Boy to the person to whom they are addressed ’ . From 1820 to 1843 the title was , ‘ To my Sister ; written at a small distance from my House , and sent by my little Boy ’ . In 1845 and afterwards , it was simply ‘ To my Sister ’ . The poem was placed by Wordsworth among those of “ Sentiment and Reflection . ” — Ed .</p>

      <head>THE COMPLAINT OF A FORSAKEN INDIAN WOMAN</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1798 .— Published 1798 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>When a Northern Indian , from sickness , is unable to continue his journey with his companions ; he is left behind , covered over with Deer-skins , and is supplied with water , food , and fuel if the situation of the place will afford it . He is informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue , and if he is unable to follow , or overtake them , he perishes alone in the Desart ; unless he should have the good fortune to fall in with some other Tribes of Indians . It is unnecessary to add that the females are equally , or still more , exposed to the same fate . See that very interesting work , Hearne 's ‘ Journey from Hudson 's Bay to the Northern Ocean ’ . When the Northern Lights , as the same writer informs us , vary their position in the air , they make a rustling and a crackling noise . This circumstance is alluded to in the first stanza of the following poem .— W . W. 1798 .</p>
     <note>At Alfoxden , in 1798 , where I read Hearne 's ‘ Journey ’ with deep interest . It was composed for the volume of “ Lyrical Ballads . ” — I. F .</note>

      <head>THE IDIOT BOY</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1798 .— Published 1798 .</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Alfoxden , 1798 . The last stanza , ‘ The cocks did crow to-whoo , to-whoo , and the sun did shine so cold , ’ was the foundation of the whole . The words were reported to me by my dear friend Thomas Poole ; but I have since heard the same repeated of other idiots . Let me add , that this long poem was composed in the groves of Alfoxden , almost extempore ; not a word , I believe , being corrected , though one stanza was omitted . I mention this in gratitude to those happy moments , for , in truth , I never wrote anything with so much glee .— I . F .</note>

     <p>The class of Beggars to which the old man here described belongs , will probably soon be extinct . It consisted of poor , and , mostly , old and infirm persons , who confined themselves to a stated round in their neighbourhood , and had certain fixed days , on which , at different houses , they regularly received charity ; sometimes in money , but mostly in provisions. - W.

     <note>Observed , and with great benefit to my own heart , when I was a child . Written at Racedown and Alfoxden in my twenty-third year . [ B ] The Political Economists were about that time beginning their war upon mendicity in all its forms , and by implication , if not directly , on alms-giving also . This heartless process has been carried as far as it can go by the AMENDED Poor Law Bill , tho ’ the inhumanity that prevails in this measure is somewhat disguised by the profession that one of its objects is to throw the poor upon the voluntary donations of their neighbours ; that is , if rightly interpreted , to force them into a condition between relief in the Union Poor House and alms robbed of their Christian grace and spirit , as being forced rather from the benevolent than given by them ; while the avaricious and selfish , and all , in fact , but the humane and charitable , are at liberty to keep all they possess from their distressed brethren .— I .

      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">I saw an aged Beggar in my walk ;</l>
       <l n="2">And he was seated , by the highway side ,</l>
       <l n="3">On a low structure of rude masonry</l>
       <l n="4">Built at the foot of a huge hill , that they</l>
       <l n="5">Who lead their horses down the steep rough road 5</l>
       <l n="6">May thence remount at ease . The aged Man</l>
       <l n="7">Had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone</l>
       <l n="8">That overlays the pile ; and , from a bag</l>
       <l n="9">All white with flour , the dole of village dames ,</l>
       <l n="10">He drew his scraps and fragments , one by one ; 10</l>
       <l n="11">And scanned them with a fixed and serious look</l>
       <l n="12">Of idle computation . In the sun ,</l>
       <l n="13">Upon the second step of that small pile ,</l>
       <l n="14">Surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills ,</l>
       <l n="15">He sat , and ate<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>his food in solitude : 15</l>
       <l n="16">And ever , scattered from his palsied hand ,</l>
       <l n="17">That , still attempting to prevent the waste ,</l>
       <l n="18">Was baffled still , the crumbs in little showers</l>
       <l n="19">Fell on the ground ; and the small mountain birds ,</l>
       <l n="20">Not venturing yet to peck their destined meal , 20</l>
       <l n="21">Approached within the length of half his staff .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="22">Him from my childhood have I known ; and then</l>
       <l n="23">He was so old , he seems not older now ;</l>
       <l n="24">He travels on , a solitary Man ,</l>
       <l n="25">So helpless in appearance , that for him 25</l>
       <l n="26">The sauntering Horseman throws not with a slack</l>
       <l n="27">And careless hand<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>his alms upon the ground ,</l>
       <l n="28">But stops ,— that he may safely lodge the coin</l>
       <l n="29">Within the old Man 's hat ; nor quits him so ,</l>
       <l n="30">But still , when he has given his horse the rein , 30</l>
       <l n="31">Watches the aged Beggar with a look<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span></l>
       <l n="32">Sidelong , and half-reverted . She who tends</l>
       <l n="33">The toll-gate , when in summer at her door</l>
       <l n="34">She turns her wheel , if on the road she sees</l>
       <l n="35">The aged beggar coming , quits her work , 35</l>
       <l n="36">And lifts the latch for him that he may pass .</l>
       <l n="37">The post-boy , when his rattling wheels o'ertake</l>
       <l n="38">The aged Beggar in the woody lane ,</l>
       <l n="39">Shouts to him from behind ; and , if thus warned<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="40">The old man does not change his course , the boy 40</l>
       <l n="41">Turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside ,</l>
       <l n="42">And passes gently by , without a curse</l>
       <l n="43">Upon his lips , or anger at his heart .</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="44">He travels on , a solitary Man ;</l>

       <l n="49">Of fields with rural works , of hill and dale ,</l>
       <l n="50">And the blue sky , one little span of earth 50</l>

       <l n="52">Bow-bent , his eyes for ever on the ground ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
       <l n="53">He plies his weary journey ; seeing still ,</l>

       <l n="61">In look and motion , that the cottage curs ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
       <l n="62">Ere he has<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>passed the door , will turn away ,</l>

       <l n="64">The vacant and the busy , maids and youths ,</l>
       <l n="65">And urchins newly breeched — all pass him by : 65</l>

   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO THE REV . ROBERT JONES , FELLOW OF ST. JOHN 'S COLLEGE , CAMBRIDGE . Dear sir , However desirous I might have been of giving you proofs of the high place you hold in my esteem , I should have been cautious of wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you , had not the circumstance of my having accompanied you amongst the Alps , seemed to give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples which your modesty might otherwise have suggested . In inscribing this little work to you I consult my heart . You know well how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a post chaise , and two travellers plodding slowly along the road , side by side , each with his little knap-sack of necessaries upon his shoulders . How much more of heart between the two latter ! I am happy in being conscious I shall have one reader who will approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret . You they must certainly interest , in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of melancholy . You will meet with few images without recollecting the spot where we observed them together , consequently , whatever is feeble in my design , or spiritless in my colouring , will be amply supplied by your own memory . With still greater propriety I might have inscribed to you a description of some of the features of your native mountains , through which we have wandered together , in the same manner , with so much pleasure . But the sea-sunsets which give such splendour to the vale of Clwyd , Snowdon , the chair of Idris , the quiet village of Bethkelert , Menai and her druids , the Alpine steeps of the Conway , and the still more interesting windings of the wizard stream of the Dee remain yet untouched . Apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects , I cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly assuring you with how much affection and esteem , I am Dear Sir , Your most obedient very humble Servant W. WORDSWORTH .

But doubly pitying Nature loves to show'r Soft on his wounded heart her healing pow'r , Who plods o'er hills and vales his road forlorn , 15 Wooing her varying charms from eve to morn . No sad vacuities his heart annoy , Blows not a Zephyr but it whispers joy ; For him lost flowers their idle sweets exhale ; He tastes the meanest note that swells the gale ; 20 For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn , And peeps the far-off spire , his evening bourn ! Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head , And dear the green-sward to his velvet tread ; Moves there a cloud o'er midhYpppHeNday 's flaming eye ? 25 Upward he looks — and calls it luxury ; Kind Nature 's charities his steps attend , In every babbling brook he finds a friend , While chast'ning thoughts of sweetest use , bestow 'd By Wisdom , moralize his pensive road . 30 Host of his welcome inn , the noon-tide bow'r , To his spare meal he calls the passing poor ; He views the Sun uprear his golden fire , Or sink , with heart alive like [ B ] Memnon 's lyre ; Blesses the Moon that comes with kindest ray 35 To light him shaken by his viewless way . With bashful fear no cottage children steal From him , a brother at the cottage meal , His humble looks no shy restraint impart , Around him plays at will the virgin heart . 40 While unsuspended wheels the village dance , The maidens eye him with inquiring glance , Much wondering what sad stroke of crazing Care Or desperate Love could lead a wanderer there . Me , lur 'd by hope her sorrows to remove , 45 A heart , that could not much itself approve , O'er Gallia 's wastes of corn dejected led , [ C ] Her road elms rustling thin above my head , Or through her truant pathway 's native charms , By secret villages and lonely farms , 50 To where the Alps , ascending white in air , Toy with the Sun , and glitter from afar . Ev'n now I sigh at hoary Chartreuse ’ doom Weeping beneath his chill of mountain gloom . Where now is fled that Power whose frown severe 55 Tam 'd “ sober Reason ” till she crouch 'd in fear ? That breath 'd a death-like peace these woods around Broke only by th ’ unvaried torrent 's sound , Or prayer-bell by the dull cicada drown 'd . The cloister startles at the gleam of arms , 60 And Blasphemy the shuddering fane alarms ; Nod the cloud-piercing pines their troubl 'd heads , Spires , rocks , and lawns , a browner night o'erspreads . Strong terror checks the female peasant 's sighs , And start th ’ astonish 'd shades at female eyes . 65 The thundering tube the aged angler hears , And swells the groaning torrent with his tears . From Bruno 's forest screams the frighted jay , And slow th ’ insulted eagle wheels away . The cross with hideous laughter Demons mock , 70 By [ D ] angels planted on the aëreal rock . The “ parting Genius ” sighs with hollow breath Along the mystic streams of [ E ] Life and Death . Swelling the outcry dull , that long resounds Portentous , thro ’ her old woods ’ trackless bounds , 75 Deepening her echoing torrents ’ awful peal And bidding paler shades her form conceal , [ F ] Vallombre , mid her falling fanes , deplores , For ever broke , the sabbath of her bow'rs . More pleas 'd , my foot the hidden margin roves 80 Of Como bosom 'd deep in chesnut groves . No meadows thrown between , the giddy steeps Tower , bare or sylvan , from the narrow deeps . To towns , whose shades of no rude sound complain , To ringing team unknown and grating wain , 85 To flat-roof 'd towns , that touch the water 's bound , Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound , Or from the bending rocks obtrusive cling , And o'er the whiten 'd wave their shadows fling ; Wild round the steeps the little [ G ] pathway twines , 90 And Silence loves it 's purple roof of vines . The viewless lingerer hence , at evening , sees From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees ; Or marks , mid opening cliffs , fair dark-ey 'd maids Tend the small harvest of their garden glades , 95 Or , led by distant warbling notes , surveys , With hollow ringing ears and darkening gaze , Binding the charmed soul in powerless trance , Lip-dewing Song and ringlet-tossing Dance , Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume 100 The bosom 'd cabin 's lyre-enliven 'd gloom ; Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view Stretch , o'er their pictur 'd mirror , broad and blue , Tracking the yellow sun from steep to steep , As up th ’ opposing hills , with tortoise foot , they creep . 105 Here half a village shines , in gold array 'd , Bright as the moon , half hides itself in shade . From the dark sylvan roofs the restless spire Inconstant glancing , mounts like springing fire . There , all unshaded , blazing forests throw no 110 Rich golden verdure on the waves below . Slow glides the sail along th ’ illumin 'd shore , And steals into the shade the lazy oar . Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs , And amourous music on the water dies . 115 Heedless how Pliny , musing here , survey 'd Old Roman boats and figures thro ’ the shade , Pale Passion , overpower 'd , retires and woos The thicket , where th ’ unlisten 'd stock-dove coos . How bless 'd , delicious Scene ! the eye that greets 120 Thy open beauties , or thy lone retreats ; Th ’ unwearied sweep of wood thy cliffs that scales , The never-ending waters of thy vales ; The cots , those dim religious groves enbow'r , Or , under rocks that from the water tow'r 125 Insinuated , sprinkling all the shore , Each with his household boat beside the door , Whose flaccid sails in forms fantastic droop , Bright'ning the gloom where thick the forests stoop ; — Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky , 130 Thy towns , like swallows ’ nests that cleave on high ; That glimmer hoar in eve 's last light , descry 'd Dim from the twilight water 's shaggy side , Whence lutes and voices down th ’ enchanted woods Steal , and compose the oar-forgotten floods , 135 While Evening 's solemn bird melodious weeps , Heard , by star-spotted bays , beneath the steeps ; — Thy lake , mid smoking woods , that blue and grey Gleams , streak 'd or dappled , hid from morning 's ray Slow-travelling down the western hills , to fold 140 It 's green-ting 'd margin in a blaze of gold ; From thickly-glittering spires the matin-bell Calling the woodman from his desert cell , A summons to the sound of oars , that pass , Spotting the steaming deeps , to early mass ; 145 Slow swells the service o'er the water born , While fill each pause the ringing woods of morn . Farewel ! those forms that , in thy noon-tide shade , Rest , near their little plots of wheaten glade ; Those stedfast eyes , that beating breasts inspire 150 To throw the “ sultry ray ” of young Desire ; Those lips , whose tides of fragrance come , and go , Accordant to the cheek 's unquiet glow ; Those shadowy breasts in love 's soft light array 'd , And rising , by the moon of passion sway 'd . 155 — Thy fragrant gales and lute-resounding streams , Breathe o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams ; While Slavery , forcing the sunk mind to dwell On joys that might disgrace the captive 's cell , Her shameless timbrel shakes along thy marge , 160 And winds between thine isles the vocal barge . Yet , arts are thine that rock th ’ unsleeping heart , And smiles to Solitude and Want impart . I lov 'd , mid thy most desert woods astray , With pensive step to measure my slow way , [ H ] 165 By lonely , silent cottage-doors to roam , The far-off peasant 's day-deserted home ; Once did I pierce to where a cabin stood , The red-breast peace had bury 'd it in wood , There , by the door a hoary-headed sire 170 Touch 'd with his wither 'd hand an aged lyre ; Beneath an old-grey oak as violets lie , Stretch 'd at his feet with stedfast , upward eye , His children 's children join 'd the holy sound , A hermit — with his family around . 175 Hence shall we seek where fair Locarno smiles Embower 'd in walnut slopes and citron isles , Or charms that smile on Tusa 's evening stream , While mid dim towers and woods her [ I ] waters gleam ; From the bright wave , in solemn gloom , retire 180 The dull-red steeps , and darkening still , aspire , To where afar rich orange lustres glow Round undistinguish 'd clouds , and rocks , and snow ; Or , led where Viamala 's chasms confine Th ’ indignant waters of the infant Rhine , 185 Bend o'er th ’ abyss ?— the else impervious gloom His burning eyes with fearful light illume . The Grison gypsey here her tent has plac 'd , Sole human tenant of the piny waste ; Her tawny skin , dark eyes , and glossy locks , 190 Bend o'er the smoke that curls beneath the rocks . — The mind condemn 'd , without reprieve , to go O'er life 's long deserts with it 's charge of woe , With sad congratulation joins the train , Where beasts and men together o'er the plain 195 Move on ,— a mighty caravan of pain ; Hope , strength , and courage , social suffering brings , Freshening the waste of sand with shades and springs . — She solitary through the desert drear Spontaneous wanders , hand in hand with Fear . 200 A giant moan along the forest swells Protracted , and the twilight storm foretells , And , ruining from the cliffs their deafening load Tumbles , the wildering Thunder slips abroad ; On the high summits Darkness comes and goes , 205 Hiding their fiery clouds , their rocks , and snows ; The torrent , travers 'd by the lustre broad , Starts like a horse beside the flashing road ; In the roof 'd [ J ] bridge , at that despairing hour , She seeks a shelter from the battering show'r . 210 — Fierce comes the river down ; the crashing wood Gives way , and half it 's pines torment the flood ; [ K ] Fearful , beneath , the Water-spirits call , And the bridge vibrates , tottering to its fall . — Heavy , and dull , and cloudy is the night , 215 No star supplies the comfort of it 's light , Glimmer the dim-lit Alps , dilated , round , And one sole light shifts in the vale profound ; While , opposite , the waning moon hangs still , And red , above her melancholy hill . 220 By the deep quiet gloom appall 'd , she sighs , Stoops her sick head , and shuts her weary eyes . — Breaking th ’ ascending roar of desert floods , And insect buzz , that stuns the sultry woods , She hears , upon the mountain forest 's brow , 225 The death-dog , howling loud and long , below ; On viewless fingers counts the valley-clock , Followed by drowsy crow of midnight cock . — Bursts from the troubl 'd Larch 's giant boughs The pie , and chattering breaks the night 's repose . 230 Low barks the fox ; by Havoc rouz 'd the bear , Quits , growling , the white bones that strew his lair ; The dry leaves stir as with the serpent 's walk , And , far beneath , Banditti voices talk ; Behind her hill the Moon , all crimson , rides , 235 And his red eyes the slinking Water hides ; Then all is hush 'd ; the bushes rustle near , And with strange tinglings sings her fainting ear . — Vex 'd by the darkness , from the piny gulf Ascending , nearer howls the famish 'd wolf , 240 While thro ’ the stillness scatters wild dismay , Her babe 's small cry , that leads him to his prey . Now , passing Urseren 's open vale serene , Her quiet streams , and hills of downy green , Plunge with the Russ embrown 'd by Terror 's breath , 245 Where danger roofs the narrow walks of death ; By floods , that , thundering from their dizzy height , Swell more gigantic on the stedfast sight ; Black drizzling craggs , that beaten by the din , Vibrate , as if a voice complain 'd within ; 250 Bare steeps , where Desolation stalks , afraid , Unstedfast , by a blasted yew upstay 'd ; By [ L ] cells whose image , trembling as he prays , Awe-struck , the kneeling peasant scarce surveys ; Loose-hanging rocks the Day 's bless 'd eye that hide , 255 And [ M ] crosses rear 'd to Death on every side , Which with cold kiss Devotion planted near , And , bending , water 'd with the human tear , Soon fading “ silent ” from her upward eye , Unmov 'd with each rude form of Danger nigh , 260 Fix 'd on the anchor left by him who saves Alike in whelming snows and roaring waves . On as we move , a softer prospect opes , Calm huts , and lawns between , and sylvan slopes . While mists , suspended on th ’ expiring gale , 265 Moveless o'erhYpppHeNhang the deep secluded vale , The beams of evening , slipping soft between , Light up of tranquil joy a sober scene ; Winding it 's dark-green wood and emerald glade , The still vale lengthens underneath the shade ; 270 While in soft gloom the scattering bowers recede , Green dewy lights adorn the freshen 'd mead , Where solitary forms illumin 'd stray Turning with quiet touch the valley 's hay , On the low [ N ] brown wood-huts delighted sleep 275 Along the brighten 'd gloom reposing deep . While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull , And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull , In solemn shapes before th ’ admiring eye Dilated hang the misty pines on high , 280 Huge convent domes with pinnacles and tow'rs , And antique castles seen tho ’ drizzling show'rs . From such romantic dreams my sould awake , Lo ! Fear looks silent down on Uri 's lake , By whose unpathway 'd margin still and dread 285 Was never heard the plodding peasant 's tread . Tower like a wall the naked rocks , or reach Far o'er the secret water dark with beech , More high , to where creation seems to end , Shade above shade the desert pines ascend , 290 And still , below , where mid the savage scene Peeps out a little speck of smilgin green , There with his infants man undaunted creeps And hangs his small wood-hut upon the steeps . A garden-plot the desert air perfumes , 295 Mid the dark pines a little orchard blooms , A zig-zag path from the domestic skiff Threading the painful cragg surmounts the cliff . — Before those hermit doors , that never know The face of traveller passing to and fro , 300 No peasant leans upon his pole , to tell For whom at morning toll 'd the funeral bell , Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark forgoes , Touch 'd by the beggar 's moan of human woes , The grass seat beneath their casement shade 305 The pilgrim 's wistful eye hath never stay 'd . — There , did the iron Genius not disdain The gentle Power that haunts the myrtle plain , There might the love-sick maiden sit , and chide Th ’ insuperable rocks and severing tide , 310 There watch at eve her lover 's sun-gilt sail Approaching , and upbraid the tardy gale , There list at midnight till is heard no more , Below , the echo of his parting oar , There hang in fear , when growls the frozen stream , 315 To guide his dangerous tread the taper 's gleam . Mid stormy vapours ever driving by , Where ospreys , cormorants , and herons cry , Where hardly giv'n the hopeless waste to chear , Deny 'd the bread of life the foodful ear , 320 Dwindles the pear on autumn 's latest spray , And apple sickens pale in summer 's ray , Ev'n here Content has fix 'd her smiling reign With Independance child of high Disdain . Exulting mid the winter of the skies , 325 Shy as the jealous chamois , Freedom flies , And often grasps her sword , and often eyes , Her crest a bough of Winter 's bleakest pine , Strange “ weeds ” and alpine plants her helm entwine , And wildly-pausing oft she hangs aghast , 330 While thrills the “ Spartan fife ” between the blast . ‘ Tis storm ; and hid in mist from hour to hour All day the floods a deeper murmur pour , And mournful sounds , as of a Spirit lost , Pipe wild along the hollow-blustering coast , 335 ‘ Till the Sun walking on his western field Shakes from behind the clouds his flashing shield . Triumphant on the bosom of the storm , Glances the fire-clad eagle 's wheeling form ; Eastward , in long perspective glittering , shine 340 The wood-crown 'd cliffs that o'er the lake recline ; Wide o'er the Alps a hundred streams unfold , At once to pillars turn 'd that flame with gold ; Behind his sail the peasant strives to shun The west that burns like one dilated sun , 345 Where in a mighty crucible expire The mountains , glowing hot , like coals of fire . [ O ] But lo ! the boatman , over-aw 'd , before The pictur 'd fane of Tell suspends his oar ; Confused the Marathonian tale appears , 350 While burn in his full eyes the glorious tears . And who but feels a power of strong controul , Felt only there , oppress his labouring soul , Who walks , where honour 'd men of ancient days Have wrought with god-like arm the deeds of praise ? 355 Say , who , by thinking on Canadian hills , Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills , On Zutphen 's plain ; or where with soften 'd gaze The old grey stones the plaided chief surveys , Can guess the high resolve , the cherish 'd pain 360 Of him whom passion rivets to the plain , Where breath 'd the gale that caught Wolfe 's happiest sigh , And the last sun-beam fell on Bayard 's eye , Where bleeding Sydney from the cup retir 'd , And glad Dundee in “ faint huzzas ” expir 'd . 365 But now with other soul I stand alone Sublime upon this far-surveying cone , And watch from [ P ] pike to pike amid the sky Small as a bird the chamois-chaser fly . ‘ Tis his with fearless step at large to roam 370 Thro ’ wastes , of Spirits wing 'd the solemn home , [ Q ] Thro ’ vacant worlds where Nature never gave A brook to murmur or a bough to wave , Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep ; Thro ’ worlds where Life and Sound , and Motion sleep , 375 Where Silence still her death-like reign extends , Save when the startling cliff unfrequent rends : In the deep snow the mighty ruin drown 'd , Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound ; — To mark a planet 's pomp and steady light 380 In the least star of scarce-appearing night , And neighbouring moon , that coasts the vast profound , Wheel pale and silent her diminish 'd round , While far and wide the icy summits blaze Rejoicing in the glory of her rays ; 385 The star of noon that glitters small and bright , Shorn of his beams , insufferably white , And flying fleet behind his orb to view Th ’ interminable sea of sable blue . — Of cloudless suns no more ye frost-built spires 390 Refract in rainbow hues the restless fires ! Ye dewy mists the arid rocks o'erhYpppHeNspread Whose slippery face derides his deathful tread ! — To wet the peak 's impracticable sides He opens of his feet the sanguine tides , 395 Weak and more weak the issuing current eyes Lapp 'd by the panting tongue of thirsty skies . [ R ] — At once bewildering mists around him close , And cold and hunger are his least of woes ; The Demon of the snow with angry roar 400 Descending , shuts for aye his prison door . Craz 'd by the strength of hope at morn he eyes As sent from heav'n the raven of the skies , Then with despair 's whole weight his spirits sink , No bread to feed him , and the snow his drink , 405 While ere his eyes can close upon the day , The eagle of the Alps o'ershades his prey . — Meanwhile his wife and child with cruel hope All night the door at every moment ope ; Haply that child in fearful doubt may gaze , 410 Passing his father 's bones in future days , Start at the reliques of that very thigh , On which so oft he prattled when a boy . Hence shall we turn where , heard with fear afar , Thunders thro ’ echoing pines the headlong Aar ? 415 Or rather stay to taste the mild delights Of pensive [ S ] Underwalden 's pastoral heights ? — Is there who mid these awful wilds has seen The native Genii walk the mountain green ? Or heard , while other worlds their charms reveal , 420 Soft music from th ’ aëreal summit steal ? While o'er the desert , answering every close , Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes . — And sure there is a secret Power that reigns Here , where no trace of man the spot profanes , 425 Nought but the herds that pasturing upward creep , Hung dim-discover 'd from the dangerous steep , [ T ] Or summer hamlet , flat and bare , on high Suspended , mid the quiet of the sky . How still ! no irreligious sound or sight 430 Rouzes the soul from her severe delight . An idle voice the sabbath region fills Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills , Broke only by the melancholy sound Of drowsy bells for ever tinkling round ; 435 Faint wail of eagle melting into blue Beneath the cliffs , and pine-woods steady sugh ; [ U ] The solitary heifer 's deepen 'd low ; Or rumbling heard remote of falling snow . Save that , the stranger seen below , the boy 440 Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy . When warm from myrtle bays and tranquil seas , Comes on , to whisper hope , the [ V ] vernal breeze , When hums the mountain bee in May 's glad ear , And emerald isles to spot the heights appear , 445 When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill , And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill , When fragrant scents beneath th ’ enchanted tread Spring up , his little all around him spread , The pastoral Swiss begins the cliffs to scale 450 To silence leaving the deserted vale , Up the green mountain tracking Summer 's feet , Each twilight earlier call 'd the Sun to meet , With earlier smile the ray of morn to view Fall on his shifting hut that gleams mid smoking dew ; 455 Bless 'd with his herds , as in the patriarch 's age , The summer long to feed from stage to stage ; O'er azure pikes serene and still , they go , And hear the rattling thunder far below ; Or lost at eve in sudden mist the day 460 Attend , or dare with minute-steps their way ; Hang from the rocks that tremble o'er the steep , And tempt the icy valley yawning deep , O'erhYpppHeNwalk the chasmy torrent 's foam-lit bed , Rock 'd on the dizzy larch 's narrow tread , 465 Whence Danger leans , and pointing ghastly , joys To mock the mind with “ desperation 's toys ” ; Or steal beneath loose mountains , half deterr 'd , That sigh and shudder to the lowing herd . — I see him , up the midway cliff he creeps 470 To where a scanty knot of verdure peeps , Thence down the steep a pile of grass he throws The fodder of his herds in winter snows . Far different life to what tradition hoar Transmits of days more bless 'd in times of yore . [ W ] 475 Then Summer lengthen 'd out his season bland , And with rock-honey flow 'd the happy land . Continual fountains welling chear 'd the waste , And plants were wholesome , now of deadly taste . Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had pil 'd 480 Usurping where the fairest herbage smil 'd ; Nor Hunger forc 'd the herds from pastures bare For scanty food the treacherous cliffs to dare . Then the milk-thistle bad those herds demand Three times a day the pail and welcome hand . 485 But human vices have provok 'd the rod Of angry Nature to avenge her God . Thus does the father to his sons relate , On the lone mountain top , their chang 'd estate . Still , Nature , ever just , to him imparts 490 Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts . — ‘ Tis morn : with gold the verdant mountain glows , More high , the snowy peaks with hues of rose . Far stretch 'd beneath the many-tinted hills A mighty waste of mist the valley fills , 495 A solemn sea ! whose vales and mountains round Stand motionless , to awful silence bound . A gulf of gloomy blue , that opens wide And bottomless , divides the midway tide . Like leaning masts of stranded ships appear 500 The pines that near the coast their summits rear ; Of cabins , woods , and lawns a pleasant shore Bounds calm and clear the chaos still and hoar ; Loud thro ’ that midway gulf ascending , sound Unnumber 'd streams with hollow roar profound . 505 Mounts thro ’ the nearer mist the chaunt of birds , And talking voices , and the low of herds , The bark of dogs , the drowsy tinkling bell , And wild-wood mountain lutes of saddest swell . Think not , suspended from the cliff on high 510 He looks below with undelighted eye . — No vulgar joy is his , at even tide Stretch 'd on the scented mountain 's purple side . For as the pleasures of his simple day Beyond his native valley hardly stray , 515 Nought round it 's darling precincts can he find But brings some past enjoyment to his mind , While Hope that ceaseless leans on Pleasure 's urn Binds her wild wreathes , and whispers his return . Once Man entirely free , alone and wild , 520 Was bless 'd as free — for he was Nature 's child . He , all superior but his God disdain 'd , Walk 'd none restraining , and by none restrain 'd , Confess 'd no law but what his reason taught , Did all he wish 'd , and wish 'd but what he ought . 525 As Man in his primaeval dower array 'd The image of his glorious sire display 'd , Ev'n so , by vestal Nature guarded , here The traces of primaeval Man appear . The native dignity no forms debase , 530 The eye sublime , and surly lion-grace . The slave of none , of beasts alone the lord , He marches with his flute , his book , and sword , Well taught by that to feel his rights , prepar 'd With this “ the blessings he enjoys to guard . ” 535 And as on glorious ground he draws his breath , Where Freedom oft , with Victory and Death , Hath seen in grim array amid their Storms Mix 'd with auxiliar Rocks , three [ X ] hundred Forms ; While twice ten thousand corselets at the view 540 Dropp 'd loud at once , Oppression shriek 'd , and flew . Oft as those sainted Rocks before him spread , An unknown power connects him with the dead . For images of other worlds are there , Awful the light , and holy is the air . 545 Uncertain thro ’ his fierce uncultur 'd soul Like lighted tempests troubled transports roll ; To viewless realms his Spirit towers amain , Beyond the senses and their little reign . And oft , when pass 'd that solemn vision by , 550 He holds with God himself communion high , When the dread peal of swelling torrents fills The sky-roof 'd temple of th ’ eternal hills , And savage Nature humbly joins the rite , While flash her upward eyes severe delight . 555 Or gazing from the mountain 's silent brow , Bright stars of ice and azure worlds of snow , Where needle peaks of granite shooting bare Tremble in ever-varying tints of air , Great joy by horror tam 'd dilates his heart , 560 And the near heav'ns their own delights impart . — When the Sun bids the gorgeous scene farewell , Alps overlooking Alps their state upswell ; Huge Pikes of Darkness nam 'd , of [ Y ] Fear and Storms Lift , all serene , their still , illumin 'd forms , 565 In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread , Ting 'd like an angel 's smile all rosy red . When downward to his winter hut he goes , Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows , That hut which from the hills his eyes employs 570 So oft , the central point of all his joys . And as a swift by tender cares oppress 'd Peeps often ere she dart into her nest , So to th ’ untrodden floor , where round him looks His father helpless as the babe he rocks , 575 Oft he descends to nurse the brother pair , Till storm and driving ice blockade him there ; There hears , protected by the woods behind , Secure , the chiding of the baffled wind , Hears Winter , calling all his Terrors round , 580 Rush down the living rocks with whirlwind sound . Thro ’ Nature 's vale his homely pleasures glide Unstain 'd by envy , discontent , and pride , The bound of all his vanity to deck With one bright bell a favourite heifer 's neck ; 585 Content upon some simple annual feast , Remember 'd half the year , and hop 'd the rest , If dairy produce , from his inner hoard , Of thrice ten summers consecrate the board . — Alas ! in every clime a flying ray 590 Is all we have to chear our wintry way , Condemn 'd , in mists and tempests ever rife , To pant slow up the endless Alp of life . “ Here , ” cried a swain , whose venerable head Bloom 'd with the snow-drops of Man 's narrow bed , 595 Last night , while by his dying fire , as clos 'd The day , in luxury my limbs repos 'd , “ Here Penury oft from misery 's mount will guide Ev'n to the summer door his icy tide , And here the avalanche of Death destroy 600 The little cottage of domestic Joy . But , ah ! th ’ unwilling mind may more than trace The general sorrows of the human race : The churlish gales , that unremitting blow Cold from necessity 's continual snow , 605 To us the gentle groups of bliss deny That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie . Yet more ; the tyrant Genius , still at strife With all the tender Charities of life , When close and closer they begin to strain , 610 No fond hand left to staunch th ’ unclosing vein , Tearing their bleeding ties leaves Age to groan On his wet bed , abandon 'd and alone . For ever , fast as they of strength become To pay the filial debt , for food to roam , 615 The father , forc 'd by Powers that only deign That solitary Man disturb their reign , From his bare nest amid the storms of heaven Drives , eagle-like , his sons as he was driven , His last dread pleasure ! watches to the plain — 620 And never , eagle-like , beholds again . ” [ Z ] When the poor heart has all its joys resign 'd , Why does their sad remembrance cleave behind ? Lo ! by the lazy Seine the exile roves , Or where thick sails illume Batavia 's groves ; 625 Soft o'er the waters mournful measures swell , Unlocking bleeding Thought 's “ memorial cell ” ; At once upon his heart Despair has set Her seal , the mortal tear his cheek has wet ; Strong poison not a form of steel can brave 630 Bows his young hairs with sorrow to the grave . Gay lark of hope thy silent song resume ! Fair smiling lights the purpled hills illume ! Soft gales and dews of life 's delicious morn , And thou , lost fragrance of the heart return ! 635 [ Aa ] Soon flies the little joy to man allow 'd , And tears before him travel like a cloud . For come Diseases on , and Penury 's rage , Labour , and Pain , and Grief , and joyless Age , And Conscience dogging close his bleeding way 640 Cries out , and leads her Spectres to their prey , ‘ Till Hope-deserted , long in vain his breath Implores the dreadful untried sleep of Death . — Mid savage rocks and seas of snow that shine Between interminable tracts of pine , 645 Round a lone fane the human Genii mourn , Where fierce the rays of woe collected burn . — From viewless lamps a ghastly dimness falls , And ebbs uncertain on the troubled walls , Dim dreadful faces thro ’ the gloom appear , 650 Abortive Joy , and Hope that works in fear , While strives a secret Power to hush the crowd , Pain 's wild rebellious burst proclaims her rights aloud . Oh give not me that eye of hard disdain That views undimm 'd Einsiedlen 's [ Bb ] wretched fane . 655 Mid muttering prayers all sounds of torment meet , Dire clap of hands , distracted chafe of feet , While loud and dull ascends the weeping cry , Surely in other thoughts contempt may die . If the sad grave of human ignorance bear 660 One flower of hope — Oh pass and leave it there . — The tall Sun , tiptoe on an Alpine spire , Flings o'er the desert blood-red streams of fire . At such an hour there are who love to stray , And meet the gladdening pilgrims on their way . 665 — Now with joy 's tearful kiss each other greet , Nor longer naked be your way-worn feet , For ye have reach 'd at last that happy shore , Where the charm 'd worm of pain shall gnaw no more . How gayly murmur and how sweetly taste 670 The [ Cc ] fountains rear 'd for you amid the waste ! Yes I will see you when ye first behold Those turrets tipp 'd by hope with morning gold , And watch , while on your brows the cross ye make , Round your pale eyes a wintry lustre wake . 675 — Without one hope her written griefs to blot , Save in the land where all things are forgot , My heart , alive to transports long unknown , Half wishes your delusion were it 's own . Last let us turn to where Chamouny [ Dd ] shields , 680 Bosom 'd in gloomy woods , her golden fields , Five streams of ice amid her cots descend , And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend , A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns Of purple lights and ever vernal plains . 685 Here lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fann 'd , Here all the Seasons revel hand in hand , — Red stream the cottage lights ; the landscape fades , Erroneous wavering mid the twilight shades . Alone ascends that mountain nam 'd of white , [ Ee ] 690 That dallies with the Sun the summer night . Six thousand years amid his lonely bounds The voice of Ruin , day and night , resounds . Where Horror-led his sea of ice assails , Havoc and Chaos blast a thousand vales , 695 In waves , like two enormous serpents , wind And drag their length of deluge train behind . Between the pines enormous boughs descry 'd Serene he towers , in deepest purple dy 'd ; Glad Day-light laughs upon his top of snow , 700 Glitter the stars above , and all is black below . At such an hour I heav 'd the human sigh , When roar 'd the sullen Arve in anger by , That not for thee , delicious vale ! unfold Thy reddening orchards , and thy fields of gold ; 705 That thou , the [ Ff ] slave of slaves , art doom 'd to pine , While no Italian arts their charms combine To teach the skirt of thy dark cloud to shine ; For thy poor babes that , hurrying from the door , With pale-blue hands , and eyes that fix 'd implore , 710 Dead muttering lips , and hair of hungry white , Besiege the traveller whom they half affright . — Yes , were it mine , the cottage meal to share Forc 'd from my native mountains bleak and bare ; O'er [ Gg ] Anet 's hopeless seas of marsh to stray , 715 Her shrill winds roaring round my lonely way ; To scent the sweets of Piedmont 's breathing rose , And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows ; In the wide range of many a weary round , Still have my pilgrim feet unfailing found , 720 As despot courts their blaze of gems display , Ev'n by the secret cottage far away The lilly of domestic joy decay ; While Freedom 's farthest hamlets blessings share , Found still beneath her smile , and only there . 725 The casement shade more luscious woodbine binds , And to the door a neater pathway winds , At early morn the careful housewife , led To cull her dinner from it 's garden bed , Of weedless herbs a healthier prospect sees , 730 While hum with busier joy her happy bees ; In brighter rows her table wealth aspires , And laugh with merrier blaze her evening fires ; Her infant 's cheeks with fresher roses glow , And wilder graces sport around their brow ; 735 By clearer taper lit a cleanlier board Receives at supper hour her tempting hoard ; The chamber hearth with fresher boughs is spread , And whiter is the hospitable bed . — And thou ! fair favoured region ! which my soul 740 Shall love , till Life has broke her golden bowl , Till Death 's cold touch her cistern-wheel assail , And vain regret and vain desire shall fail ; Tho ’ now , where erst the grey-clad peasant stray 'd , To break the quiet of the village shade 745 Gleam war 's [ Hh ] discordant habits thro ’ the trees , And the red banner mock the sullen breeze ; Tho ’ now no more thy maids their voices suit To the low-warbled breath of twilight lute , And heard , the pausing village hum between , 750 No solemn songstress lull the fading green , Scared by the fife , and rumbling drum 's alarms , And the short thunder , and the flash of arms ; While , as Night bids the startling uproar die , Sole sound , the [ Ii ] sourd renews his mournful cry : 755 — Yet , hast thou found that Freedom spreads her pow'r Beyond the cottage hearth , the cottage door : All nature smiles ; and owns beneath her eyes Her fields peculiar , and peculiar skies . Yes , as I roam 'd where Loiret 's [ Jj ] waters glide 760 Thro ’ rustling aspins heard from side to side , When from October clouds a milder light Fell , where the blue flood rippled into white , Methought from every cot the watchful bird Crowed with ear-piercing power ‘ till then unheard ; 765 Each clacking mill , that broke the murmuring streams , Rock 'd the charm 'd thought in more delightful dreams ; Chasing those long long dreams the falling leaf Awoke a fainter pang of moral grief ; The measured echo of the distant flail 770 Winded in sweeter cadence down the vale ; A more majestic tide the [ Kk ] water roll 'd , And glowed the sun-gilt groves in richer gold : — Tho ’ Liberty shall soon , indignant , raise Red on his hills his beacon 's comet blaze ; 775 Bid from on high his lonely cannon sound , And on ten thousand hearths his shout rebound ; His larum-bell from village-tow'r to tow'r Swing on th ’ astounded ear it 's dull undying roar : Yet , yet rejoice , tho ’ Pride 's perverted ire 780 Rouze Hell 's own aid , and wrap thy hills in fire . Lo ! from th ’ innocuous flames , a lovely birth ! With it 's own Virtues springs another earth : Nature , as in her prime , her virgin reign Begins , and Love and Truth compose her train ; 785 With pulseless hand , and fix 'd unwearied gaze , Unbreathing Justice her still beam surveys : No more , along thy vales and viny groves , Whole hamlets disappearing as he moves , With cheeks o'erspread by smiles of baleful glow , 790 On his pale horse shall fell Consumption go . Oh give , great God , to Freedom 's waves to ride Sublime o'er Conquest , Avarice , and Pride , To break , the vales where Death with Famine scow'rs , And dark Oppression builds her thick-ribb 'd tow'rs ; 795 Where Machination her fell soul resigns , Fled panting to the centre of her mines ; Where Persecution decks with ghastly smiles Her bed , his mountains mad Ambition piles ; Where Discord stalks dilating , every hour , 800 And crouching fearful at the feet of Pow'r , Like Lightnings eager for th ’ almighty word , Look up for sign of havoc , Fire , and Sword ; [ Ll ] — Give them , beneath their breast while Gladness springs , To brood the nations o'er with Nile-like wings ; 805 And grant that every sceptred child of clay , Who cries , presumptuous , “ here their tides shall stay , ” Swept in their anger from th ’ affrighted shore , With all his creatures sink — to rise no more . To-night , my friend , within this humble cot 810 Be the dead load of mortal ills forgot , Renewing , when the rosy summits glow At morn , our various journey , sad and slow . FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT [ Footnote A : All the notes to this reprint of the edition of 1793 are Wordsworth 's own , as given in that edition .— Ed . ] [ Footnote B : The lyre of Memnon is reported to have emitted melancholy or chearful tones , as it was touched by the sun 's evening or morning rays . ] [ Footnote C : There are few people whom it may be necessary to inform , that the sides of many of the post-roads in France are planted with a row of trees . ] [ Footnote D : Alluding to crosses seen on the tops of the spiry rocks of the Chartreuse , which have every appearance of being inaccessible . ] [ Footnote E : Names of rivers at the Chartreuse . ] [ Footnote F : Name of one of the vallies of the Chartreuse . ] [ Footnote G : If any of my readers should ever visit the Lake of Como , I recommend it to him to take a stroll along this charming little pathway : he must chuse the evening , as it is on the western side of the Lake . We pursued it from the foot of the water to it 's head : it is once interrupted by a ferry . ] [ Footnote H : Solo , e pensoso i più deserti campi Vò misurando à passi tardi , e lenti . ‘ Petrarch ’ . ] [ Footnote I : The river along whose banks you descend in crossing the Alps by the Semplon pass . From the striking contrast of it 's features , this pass I should imagine to be the most interesting among the Alps . ] [ Footnote J : Most of the bridges among the Alps are of wood and covered : these bridges have a heavy appearance , and rather injure the effect of the scenery in some places . ] [ Footnote K : “ Red came the river down , and loud , and oft The angry Spirit of the water shriek 'd . ” HOME 'S ‘ Douglas ’ . ] [ Footnote L : The Catholic religion prevails here , these cells are , as is well known , very common in the Catholic countries , planted , like the Roman tombs , along the road side . ] [ Footnote M : Crosses commemorative of the deaths of travellers by the fall of snow and other accidents very common along this dreadful road . ] [ Footnote N : The houses in the more retired Swiss valleys are all built of wood . ] [ Footnote O : I had once given to these sketches the title of Picturesque ; but the Alps are insulted in applying to them that term . Whoever , in attempting to describe their sublime features , should confine himself to the cold rules of painting would give his reader but a very imperfect idea of those emotions which they have the irresistible power of communicating to the most impassive imaginations . The fact is , that controuling influence , which distinguishes the Alps from all other scenery , is derived from images which disdain the pencil . Had I wished to make a picture of this scene I had thrown much less light into it . But I consulted nature and my feelings . The ideas excited by the stormy sunset I am here describing owed their sublimity to that deluge of light , or rather of fire , in which nature had wrapped the immense forms around me ; any intrusion of shade , by destroying the unity of the impression , had necessarily diminished its grandeur . ] [ Footnote P : Pike is a word very commonly used in the north of England , to signify a high mountain of the conic form , as Langdale pike , etc . ] [ Footnote Q : For most of the images in the next sixteen verses I am indebted to M. Raymond 's interesting observations annexed to his translation of Coxe 's ‘ Tour in Switzerland ’ . ] [ Footnote R : The rays of the sun drying the rocks frequently produce on their surface a dust so subtile and slippery , that the wretched chamois-chasers are obliged to bleed themselves in the legs and feet in order to secure a footing . ] [ Footnote S : The people of this Canton are supposed to be of a more melancholy disposition than the other inhabitants of the Alps : this , if true , may proceed from their living more secluded . ] [ Footnote T : These summer hamlets are most probably ( as I have seen observed by a critic in the ‘ Gentleman 's Magazine ’ ) what Virgil alludes to in the expression “ Castella in tumulis . ” ] [ Footnote U : Sugh , a Scotch word expressive of the sound of the wind through the trees . ] [ Footnote V : This wind , which announces the spring to the Swiss , is called in their language Foen ; and is according to M. Raymond the Syroco of the Italians . ] [ Footnote W : This tradition of the golden age of the Alps , as M. Raymond observes , is highly interesting , interesting not less to the philosopher than to the poet . Here I cannot help remarking , that the superstitions of the Alps appear to be far from possessing that poetical character which so eminently distinguishes those of Scotland and the other mountainous northern countries . The Devil with his horns , etc ., seems to be in their idea , the principal agent that brings about the sublime natural revolutions that take place daily before their eyes . ] [ Footnote X : Alluding to several battles which the Swiss in very small numbers have gained over their oppressors the house of Austria ; and in particular , to one fought at Naeffels near Glarus , where three hundred and thirty men defeated an army of between fifteen and twenty thousand Austrians . Scattered over the valley are to be found eleven stones , with this inscription , 1388 , the year the battle was fought , marking out as I was told upon the spot , the several places where the Austrians attempting to make a stand were repulsed anew . ] [ Footnote Y : As Schreck-Horn , the pike of terror . Wetter-Horn , the pike of storms , etc . etc . ] [ Footnote Z : The effect of the famous air called in French Ranz des Vaches upon the Swiss troops removed from their native country is well known , as also the injunction of not playing it on pain of death , before the regiments of that nation , in the service of France and Holland . ] [ Footnote Aa : Optima quæque dies , etc . ] [ Footnote Bb : This shrine is resorted to , from a hope of relief , by multitudes , from every corner of the Catholick world , labouring under mental or bodily afflictions . ] [ Footnote Cc : Rude fountains built and covered with sheds for the accommodation of the pilgrims , in their ascent of the mountain . Under these sheds the sentimental traveller and the philosopher may find interesting sources of meditation . ] [ Footnote Dd : This word is pronounced upon the spot Chàmouny , I have taken the liberty of reading it long thinking it more musical . ] [ Footnote Ee : It is only from the higher part of the valley of Chàmouny that Mont Blanc is visible . ] [ Footnote Ff : It is scarce necessary to observe that these lines were written before the emancipation of Savoy . ] [ Footnote Gg : A vast extent of marsh so called near the lake of Neuf-chatel . ] [ Footnote Hh : This , as may be supposed , was written before France became the seat of war . ] [ Footnote Ii : An insect so called , which emits a short , melancholy cry , heard , at the close of the summer evenings , on the banks of the Loire . ] [ Footnote Jj : The river Loiret , which has the honour of giving name to a department , rises out of the earth at a place , called La Source , a league and a half south-east of Orleans , and taking at once the character of a considerable stream , winds under a most delicious bank on its left , with a flat country of meadows , woods , and vineyards on its right , till it falls into the Loire about three or four leagues below Orleans . The hand of false taste has committed on its banks those outrages which the Abbé de Lille so pathetically deprecates in those charming verses descriptive of the Seine , visiting in secret the retreat of his friend Watelet . Much as the Loiret , in its short course , suffers from injudicious ornament , yet are there spots to be found upon its banks as soothing as meditation could wish for : the curious traveller may meet with some of them where it loses itself among the mills in the neighbourhood of the villa called La Fontaine . The walks of La Source , where it takes its rise , may , in the eyes of some people , derive an additional interest from the recollection that they were the retreat of Bolingbroke during his exile , and that here it was that his philosophical works were chiefly composed . The inscriptions , of which he speaks in one of his letters to Swift descriptive of this spot , are not , I believe , now extant . The gardens have been modelled within these twenty years according to a plan evidently not dictated by the taste of the friend of Pope . ] [ Footnote Kk : The duties upon many parts of the French rivers were so exorbitant that the poorer people , deprived of the benefit of water carriage , were obliged to transport their goods by land . ] [ Footnote Ll : — And , at his heels , Leash 'd in like hounds , should Famine , Sword , and Fire , Crouch for employment . ]</p>

    <p n="10">The pedestrians bought a boat at Basle , and in it floated down the Rhine as far as Cologne , intending to proceed in the same way to Ostend ; but they returned to England from Cologne by Calais . In the course of this tour , Wordsworth wrote a letter to his sister , dated “ Sept. 6 , 1790 , Keswill , a small village on the Lake of Constance , ” which will be found amongst his letters in a subsequent volume .— Ed .</p>
    <p n="11">APPENDIX III</p>
    <p n="12">The following two variants in ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ are from MS. notes written in the late Lord Coleridge 's copy of the edition of 1836-7 .</p>
    <p n="13">l. 247 .</p>
    <p n="14">Yet the world 's business hither finds its way At times , and unsought tales beguile the day , And tender thoughts are those which Solitude</p>
    <p n="15">l. 249 .</p>
    <p n="16">Yet tender thoughts dwell there . No Solitude Hath power Youth 's natural feelings to exclude .</p>
    <p n="17">APPENDIX IV</p>
    <p n="18">‘ Anecdote for Fathers ’</p>
    <p n="19">See Eusebius ’ ‘ Præparatio Evangelica ’ , vi . 5 .— [ Greek : kleie bien kartos te logon pseudegora lexo ] — which was Apollo 's answer to certain persons who tried to force his oracle to reply .— Ed .</p>
    <p n="20">APPENDIX V</p>
    <p n="21">‘ The Thorn ’</p>
    <p n="22">William Taylor 's translation of Bürger 's ‘ Pfarrer 's Tochter ’ appeared in ‘ The Monthly Magazine ’ ( 1796 ) , and as the same volume contained contributions by Coleridge and Lamb , it is possible that Wordsworth saw it . Bürger 's Pastor 's Daughter murdered her natural child , but it is her ghost which haunts its grave , which she had torn</p>
    <p n="23">With bleeding nails beside the pond , And nightly pines the pool beside .</p>
    <p n="24">APPENDIX VI</p>
    <p n="25">‘ Simon Lee ’</p>
    <p n="26">It was found impossible fully to describe , within the limits of a footnote , the endless shiftings to and fro of the stanzas and half stanzas of ‘ Simon Lee ’ . The first eight stanzas of the edition of 1798 are therefore reprinted in this Appendix ; and a Table is added , by means of which the various transpositions effected from time to time may be readily ascertained . In the Table ‘ a ’ stands for lines 1-4 , and ‘ b ’ for lines 5-8 of a stanza .</p>
    <p n="27">In the sweet shire of Cardigan , Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall , An old man dwells , a little man , I 've heard he once was tall . Of years he has upon his back , No doubt , a burthen weighty ; He says he is three score and ten , But others say he 's eighty .</p>
    <p n="28">A long blue livery-coat has he , That 's fair behind , and fair before ; Yet , meet him where you will , you see At once that he is poor . Full five and twenty years he lived A running huntsman merry ; And , though he has but one eye left , His cheek is like a cherry .</p>
    <p n="29">No man like him the horn could sound , And no man was so full of glee ; To say the least , four counties round Had heard of Simon Lee ; His master 's dead , and no one now Dwells in the hall of Ivor ; Men , dogs , and horses , all are dead ; He is the sole survivor .</p>
    <p n="30">His hunting feats have him bereft Of his right eye , as you may see : And then , what limbs those feats have left To poor old Simon Lee ! He has no son , he has no child , His wife , an aged woman , Lives with him , near the waterfall , Upon the village common .</p>
    <p n="31">And he is lean and he is sick , His little body 's half awry His ancles they are swoln and thick ; His legs are thin and dry . When he was young he little knew Of husbandry or tillage ; And now he 's forced to work , though weak , — The weakest in the village .</p>
    <p n="32">He all the country could outrun , Could leave both man and horse behind ; And often , ere the race was done , He reeled and was stone-blind . And still there 's something in the world At which his heart rejoices ; For when the chiming hounds are out , He dearly loves their voices !</p>
    <p n="33">Old Ruth works out of doors with him , And does what Simon cannot do ; For she , not over stout of limb , Is stouter of the two . And though you with your utmost skill From labour could not wean them , Alas ! ‘ tis very little , all Which they can do between them .</p>
    <p n="34">Beside their moss-grown hut of clay , Not twenty paces from the door , A scrap of land they have , but they Are poorest of the poor . This scrap of land he from the heath Enclosed when he was stronger ; But what avails the land to them , Which they can till no longer ?</p>
