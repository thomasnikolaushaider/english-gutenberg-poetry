    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">In the summer of 1807 , a party of my good friends in Gloucestershire proposed to themselves a short excursion down the Wye , and through part of South Wales .</p>
    <p n="2">While this plan was in agitation , the lines which I had composed on “ Shooter 's Hill , ” during ill health , and inserted in my last volume , obtained their particular attention . A spirit of prediction , as well as sorrow , is there indulged ; and it was now in the power of this happy party to falsify such predictions , and to render a pleasure to the writer of no common kind . An invitation to accompany them was the consequence ; and the following Journal is the result of that invitation .</p>
    <p n="3">Should the reader , from being a resident , or frequent visitor , be well acquainted with the route , and able to discover inaccuracies in distances , succession of objects , or local particulars , he is requested to recollect , that the party was out but ten days ; a period much too short for correct and laborious description , but quite sufficient for all the powers of poetry which I feel capable of exerting . The whole exhibits the language and feelings of a man who had never before seen a mountainous country ; and of this it is highly necessary that the reader should be apprized .</p>
    <p n="4">A Swiss , or perhaps a Scottish Highlander , may smile at supposed or real exaggerations ; but they will be excellent critics , when they call to mind that they themselves judge , in these cases , as I do , by comparison .</p>
    <p n="5">Perhaps it may be said , that because much of public approbation has fallen to my lot , it was unwise to venture again . I confess that the journey left such powerful , such unconquerable impressions on my mind , that embodying my thoughts in rhyme became a matter almost of necessity . To the parties concerned I know it will be an acceptable little volume : to whom , and to the public , it Is submitted with due respect .</p>

     <l n="1">“ Rouse from thy slumber , pleasure calls , arise ,</l>
     <l n="2">Quit thy half-rural bower , awhile despise</l>
     <l n="3">The thraldom that consumes thee . We who dwell</l>
     <l n="4">Far from thy land of smoke , advise thee well .</l>
     <l n="5">Here Nature 's bounteous hand around shall fling ,</l>
     <l n="6">Scenes that thy Muse hath never dar 'd to sing .</l>
     <l n="7">When sickness weigh 'd thee down , and strength declin 'd ;</l>
     <l n="8">When dread eternity absorb 'd thy mind ,</l>
     <l n="9">Flow 'd the predicting verse , by gloom o'erspread ,</l>
     <l n="10">That ‘ Cambrian mountains ’ thou should'st never tread ,</l>
     <l n="11">That ‘ time-worn cliff , and classic stream to see , ’</l>
     <l n="12">Was wealth 's prerogative , despair for thee .</l>
     <l n="13">Come to the proof ; with us the breeze inhale ,</l>
     <l n="14">Renounce despair , and come to Severn 's vale ;</l>
     <l n="15">And where the COTSWOLD HILLS are stretch 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="16">Seek our green dell , as yet unknown to song :</l>
     <l n="17">Start hence with us , and trace , with raptur 'd eye ,</l>
     <l n="18">The wild meanderings of the beauteous WYE ;</l>
     <l n="19">Thy ten days leisure ten days joy shall prove ,</l>
     <l n="20">And rock and stream breathe amity and love . ”</l>

     <l n="30">Chaste as the theme , to triumph over time !</l>
     <l n="31">Bright as the rising day , and firm as truth ,</l>
     <l n="32">To speak new transports to the lowland youth ,</l>
     <l n="33">That bosoms still might throb , and still adore ,</l>
     <l n="34">When his who strives to charm them beats no more !</l>

   <p>GOD 'S WILL BE DONE ,</p>
   <p>“ Who , in his mercy , hath granted consolation to the parents of the dear departed , in the reflection , that he possessed truth , innocence , filial piety , and fraternal affection , in the highest degree . That , but a few moments before he was called to a better life , he had ( with a never to be forgotten piety ) joined his family in joyful thanks to his Maker , for the restoration of his mother 's health . His parents , in justice to his amiable virtue , and excellent disposition , declare , that he was void of offence towards them . With humbled hearts they bow to the Almighty 's dispensation ; trusting , through the mediation of his blessed Son , he will mercifully receive their child he so suddenly took to himself .</p>
   <p>“ This monument is here erected to warn parents and others how they trust the deceitful stream ; and particularly to exhort them to learn and observe the directions of the Humane Society , for the recovery of persons apparently drowned . Alas ! it is with the extremest sorrow here commemorated , what anguish is felt from a want of this knowledge . The lamented swam very well ; was endowed with great bodily strength and activity ; and possibly , had proper application been used , might have been saved from his untimely fate . He was born at Oporto , in the kingdom of Portugal , on the 14th of February , 1789 ; third son of James Warre , of London , and of the county of Somerset , merchant , and Elinor , daughter of Thomas Gregg , of Belfast , Esq .</p>
   <p>“ Passenger , whoever thou art , spare this tomb ! It is erected for the benefit of the surviving , being but a poor record of the grief of those who witnessed the sad occasion of it . God preserve you and yours from such calamity ! May you not require their assistance ; but if you should , the apparatus , with directions for the application by the Humane Society , for the saving of persons apparently drowned , are lodged at the church of Coldwell . ”</p>
   <p>On the opposite side is inscribed “ It is with gratitude acknowledged by the parents of the deceased , that permission was gratuitously , and most obligingly , granted for the erection of this monument , by William Vaughan , Esq . of Courtfield . ” ]</p>
