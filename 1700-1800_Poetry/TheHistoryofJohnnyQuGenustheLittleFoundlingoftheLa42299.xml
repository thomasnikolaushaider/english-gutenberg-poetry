    <docTitle><titlePart>HISTORY OF QUAE GENUS , ETC . The favour which has been bestowed on the different TOURS OF DOCTOR SYNTAX , has encouraged the Writer of them to give a HISTORY OF THE FOUNDLING , who has been thought an interesting Object in the latter of those Volumes ; and it is written in the same style and manner , with a view to connect it with them . This Child of Chance , it is presumed , is led through a track of Life not unsuited to the peculiarity of his Condition and Character , while its varieties , as in the former Works , are represented by the Pencil of MR. ROWLANDSON with its accustomed characteristic Felicity . The Idea of an English GIL BLAS predominated through the whole of this Volume ; which must be considered as fortunate in no common degree , if its readers , in the course of their perusal , should be disposed to acknowledge even a remote Similitude to the incomparable Work of Le Sage .

    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">This prolonged work is , at length , brought to a close .— It has grown to this size , under rare and continuing marks of public favour ; while the same mode of Composition has been employed in the last , as in the former Volumes . They are all equally indebted to MR. ROWLANDSON 'S talents .</p>
    <p n="2">It may , perhaps , be considered as presumption in me , and at my age , to sport even with my own Dowdy Muse , but , from the extensive patronage which DOCTOR SYNTAX has received , it may be presumed that , more or less , he has continued to amuse : And I , surely , have no reason to be dissatisfied , when Time points at my eightieth Year , that I can still afford some pleasure to those who are disposed to be pleased .</p>

      <l n="2">Johnny Quae Genus ! what a name</l>
      <l n="3">To offer to the voice of Fame !</l>
      <l n="4">( Though she ‘ tis hop 'd may condescend</l>
      <l n="5">To act as Little Johnny 's friend )</l>
      <l n="6">This may be said , when first the eye</l>
      <l n="7">Does , by a careless glance , descry</l>
      <l n="8">The striking range of marshall 'd words</l>
      <l n="9">Which a gay TITLE-PAGE affords .</l>
      <l n="10">But what 's a name , as SHAKESPEARE says ,</l>
      <l n="11">It neither gives nor lessens praise ;</l>
      <l n="12">Adds no fresh odour to the rose ,</l>
      <l n="13">Nor any other flower that blows :</l>
      <l n="14">Whether with rare or common name</l>
      <l n="15">The fragrance will be just the same .</l>
      <l n="16">‘ Tis not a title can confer</l>
      <l n="17">The good or ill of character ,</l>
      <l n="18">HOWARDS have been both beat and bang 'd ,</l>
      <l n="19">And some with ancient names been hang 'd :</l>
      <l n="20">Look at a ship with convicts stor 'd</l>
      <l n="21">What noble names are oft on board !</l>
      <l n="22">It is the living , current course</l>
      <l n="23">Or of the better or the worse ,</l>
      <l n="24">That stamps , whate'er may be the name ,</l>
      <l n="25">Or with a good or evil fame .</l>
      <l n="26">But howsoe'er the thing we view</l>
      <l n="27">Our little Johnny 's title 's new :</l>
      <l n="28">Or for the child or for the man ,</l>
      <l n="29">In an old phrase , ‘ tis spick and span .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="3">
      <l n="30">Besides , as most folk do agree</l>
      <l n="31">To find a charm in novelty ,</l>
      <l n="32">‘ Tis the first time that Grammar rule</l>
      <l n="33">Which makes boys tremble when at school ,</l>
      <l n="34">Did with the name an union crave</l>
      <l n="35">Which at the font a sponsor gave .</l>
      <l n="36">But whether ‘ twas in hum'rous mood</l>
      <l n="37">Or by some classic whim pursued ,</l>
      <l n="38">Or as , in Eton 's Grammar known ,</l>
      <l n="39">It bore relation to his own ,</l>
      <l n="40">Syntax , it was at Whitsuntide ,</l>
      <l n="41">And a short time before he died ,</l>
      <l n="42">In pleasant humour , after dinner ,</l>
      <l n="43">Surnam 'd , in wine , the little sinner .</l>
      <l n="44">And thus , amid the table 's roar , }</l>
      <l n="45">Gave him from good , old Lilly 's store , }</l>
      <l n="46">A name which none e'er had before . }</l>
      <l n="47">— ‘ Squire Worthy , who , perchance was there ,</l>
      <l n="48">Promis 'd the Doctor 's wish to share ,</l>
      <l n="49">That want , at least might not annoy</l>
      <l n="50">The progress of the Foundling Boy .</l>
      <l n="51">“ — Syntax , ” He said , “ We 'll try between us</l>
      <l n="52">To make the fortune of QUAE GENUS :</l>
      <l n="53">You feed his mind with learning 's food ,</l>
      <l n="54">And I 'll protect him if he 's good . ”</l>
      <l n="55">“ While I , ” said smiling Dickey Bend ,</l>
      <l n="56">“ Will add my mite as Johnny 's friend ;</l>
      <l n="57">Nor shall he want the scraps of knowledge</l>
      <l n="58">Which he can pick up at my College . ”</l>
      <l n="59">— Thus , as they did the bumper ply</l>
      <l n="60">To Johnny 's future destiny ,</l>
      <l n="61">The warm , almost parental heart</l>
      <l n="62">Of Mrs. Syntax bore its part ;</l>
      <l n="63">And her cheek wore a smile of joy</l>
      <l n="64">As she beheld th ’ unconscious boy ,</l>
      <l n="65">Who , careless of the kind debate ,</l>
      <l n="66">Play 'd with the cherries on his plate .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="4">
      <l n="67">But such is life 's uncertain hour ,</l>
      <l n="68">And such is fate 's tyrannic power ,</l>
      <l n="69">That while our comforts smile around</l>
      <l n="70">The fatal dart inflicts the wound :</l>
      <l n="71">Thus e'er another month was past</l>
      <l n="72">Syntax , alas ! had breath 'd his last .</l>
      <l n="73">Whene'er he heard the widow sigh</l>
      <l n="74">QUAE GENUS wept he scarce knew why :</l>
      <l n="75">Of a kind friend fate had bereft him ,</l>
      <l n="76">And an odd name was all he left him .</l>
      <l n="77">His urchin fancy only thought</l>
      <l n="78">As his enquiring mind was taught ,</l>
      <l n="79">That his adopted sire was gone</l>
      <l n="80">Where the good go to worlds unknown ,</l>
      <l n="81">To happy regions plac 'd on high</l>
      <l n="82">Above the blue and starry sky ,</l>
      <l n="83">Where , he was with the hope endued ,</l>
      <l n="84">That he should go , if he were good .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="5">
      <l n="85">But the good lady took him home</l>
      <l n="86">And kept him many a year to come ;</l>
      <l n="87">When he grew up a charming youth ,</l>
      <l n="88">In whom simplicity and truth</l>
      <l n="89">Did o'er his ev'ry thought preside ;</l>
      <l n="90">While , with such an anxious guide ,</l>
      <l n="91">Life smil 'd and seem 'd to promise fair ,</l>
      <l n="92">That it would answer to the care</l>
      <l n="93">Which her affection had bestow 'd ,</l>
      <l n="94">To set him on his future road :</l>
      <l n="95">But when she died poor John was hurl 'd</l>
      <l n="96">Into a bustling , tricking world .</l>
      <l n="97">He had , ‘ tis true , all she could leave ;</l>
      <l n="98">She gave him all there was to give ;</l>
      <l n="99">Of all she had she made him heir ,</l>
      <l n="100">But left it to a lawyer 's care :</l>
      <l n="101">No wonder then that he was cheated</l>
      <l n="102">And her fond anxious hopes defeated :</l>
      <l n="103">So that instead of his possessing</l>
      <l n="104">The fruits of her last , dying blessing ;</l>
      <l n="105">He had , as it turn 'd out , to rue }</l>
      <l n="106">What foul rascality could do ; }</l>
      <l n="107">And his own wild vagaries too . }</l>

     <l n="1">“ Sir Jeffery , as , I trust , you know ,</l>
     <l n="2">Is gone , Sir , where we all must go ;</l>
     <l n="3">In spite of all your healing power ,</l>
     <l n="4">Has reach 'd , at length , his final hour ,</l>
     <l n="5">Though had he trusted all to you , }</l>
     <l n="6">And to Sir MIDRIFF bade adieu , }</l>
     <l n="7">Which he was half inclin 'd to do , }</l>
     <l n="8">Perhaps , my present visit here</l>
     <l n="9">Would not so penniless appear ;</l>
     <l n="10">For I am come , as you must see ,</l>
     <l n="11">Without the pass-port of a fee .</l>
     <l n="12">It is self-interest , I fear ,</l>
     <l n="13">Yes , I must own it , brings me here .</l>
     <l n="14">Since his departure I am hurl 'd</l>
     <l n="15">To push my fortune in the world ,</l>
     <l n="16">And may I now with courage say ,</l>
     <l n="17">You will assist me on my way ?</l>
     <l n="18">— Such is , alas ! my alter 'd case ,</l>
     <l n="19">I 'm seeking for another place ,</l>
     <l n="20">Though e'en my visionary mind</l>
     <l n="21">Can never hope again to find</l>
     <l n="22">Such a so envied household post ,</l>
     <l n="23">As that which I have lately lost .</l>
     <l n="24">With fortune I shall ne'er contend</l>
     <l n="25">But smile on that which she may send ;</l>
     <l n="26">And of whatever state possest ,</l>
     <l n="27">Be satisfied and act my best .</l>
     <l n="28">Now , as I 've reason well to know ,</l>
     <l n="29">Though ‘ tis not you have told me so ,</l>
     <l n="30">That persons of superior worth ,</l>
     <l n="31">The wealthy and of noble birth ;</l>
     <l n="32">Who , tir 'd of physic 's settled rules ,</l>
     <l n="33">As taught in colleges and schools ,</l>
     <l n="34">Have sought your bold and fearless skill ,</l>
     <l n="35">The potent drafts and secret pill ,</l>
     <l n="36">Which your Acumen can impart ,</l>
     <l n="37">Beyond the reach of drudging art ,</l>
     <l n="38">And I have heard will cure the pain ,</l>
     <l n="39">When boasting science tries in vain :</l>
     <l n="40">Nor is this all , the tonish fair</l>
     <l n="41">Attend to seek your healing care .</l>
     <l n="42">When here I 've for Sir Jeffery been , }</l>
     <l n="43">Dames of high figure I have seen , }</l>
     <l n="44">Lolling behind your folding screen }</l>
     <l n="45">With all their gay caricatures</l>
     <l n="46">The lively eye 's attractive lures .</l>
     <l n="47">Broad bonnets all beflower 'd o'er ,</l>
     <l n="48">Are often passing through your door ,</l>
     <l n="49">And I have glanc 'd at many a shawl</l>
     <l n="50">That glided through your gloomy hall .</l>
     <l n="51">When such grand visitors as these</l>
     <l n="52">Apply to you to give them ease ;</l>
     <l n="53">And when your skill relieves their pain ,</l>
     <l n="54">That is the time their grace to gain ,</l>
     <l n="55">And then , good Doctor , you might see</l>
     <l n="56">If you could gain a grace for me ;</l>
     <l n="57">While to some patient you commend</l>
     <l n="58">The service of your humble friend :</l>
     <l n="59">Nor will he fail returns to make ,</l>
     <l n="60">Which you may condescend to take ;</l>
     <l n="61">And grateful memory will repay</l>

     <l n="66">As sure as my name 's ANODYNE .</l>
     <l n="67">— If worth lay in a flatt'ring tongue ,</l>
     <l n="68">You would not want a service long ;</l>
     <l n="69">For if you do with caution use it ,</l>
     <l n="70">Where is the ear that will refuse it ?</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Tis but the art how to apply</l>
     <l n="72">The well-conceal 'd artillery ,</l>
     <l n="73">And , more or less , the well-told tale</l>
     <l n="74">Will o'er the pliant mind prevail .</l>
     <l n="75">Your int'rest , friend , I 'll not neglect ,</l>
     <l n="76">Perhaps do more than you expect ;</l>
     <l n="77">Nay , I e'en may your mind surprise ,</l>
     <l n="78">When I mark how that int'rest lies ;—</l>
     <l n="79">But ‘ tis not where your hopes may look ,</l>
     <l n="80">‘ Tis not that page in fortune 's book .</l>
     <l n="81">— The higher folk who come to me</l>
     <l n="82">Are all involv 'd in secrecy :</l>
     <l n="83">Those who can n't walk employ a hack ,</l>
     <l n="84">When they employ the humble quack :</l>
     <l n="85">Hence , no fine carriages resort</l>
     <l n="86">About the purlieus of my court ,</l>
     <l n="87">For the rich owners , with their wealth ,</l>
     <l n="88">Blush to pass this bye-way to health .</l>
     <l n="89">Such is proud fashion 's powerful rule</l>
     <l n="90">O'er many a purse-proud , titled fool :</l>
     <l n="91">They tell me all their sickness claims ,</l>
     <l n="92">But seem afraid to tell their names .</l>
     <l n="93">— There 's an old man I sometimes see ,</l>
     <l n="94">And faith he brings a handsome fee ,</l>
     <l n="95">Whose hackney always drops his fare</l>
     <l n="96">Just by , in the adjoining Square :</l>
     <l n="97">Where , when we 've clos 'd our consultation ,</l>
     <l n="98">He hobbles to regain his station .</l>
     <l n="99">In a loose coat of common wear ,</l>
     <l n="100">This person chuses to appear ;</l>
     <l n="101">With his round hat and dingy caxon ,</l>
     <l n="102">He calls himself a Mr. Jackson ;</l>
     <l n="103">Though still his manners and his words</l>
     <l n="104">Are such as highest rank affords :</l>
     <l n="105">And , sure as I e'er gave a puke ,</l>
     <l n="106">I know the man to be a duke .—</l>
     <l n="107">But I , of course , the secret keep ,</l>
     <l n="108">And let his splendid titles sleep .</l>
     <l n="109">— I have two ladies now in hand ,</l>
     <l n="110">Whose whims and fancies I command :</l>
     <l n="111">They tell of humours on the skin ,</l>
     <l n="112">But then they only shew their chin ;</l>
     <l n="113">No other part they let me see ,</l>
     <l n="114">Such is their bashful fantasy .</l>
     <l n="115">They seem to think I doubt their graces ,</l>
     <l n="116">As veils o'erspread their pimpled faces ,</l>
     <l n="117">So that where'er they chuse to show ‘ em ,</l>
     <l n="118">I do not think that I should know ‘ em .</l>
     <l n="119">Yet by their chat they have betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="120">That one 's a wife , and one 's a maid :</l>
     <l n="121">Nor from the names can they refrain</l>
     <l n="122">Of Lady Bell and Lady Jane .</l>
     <l n="123">They never fail in their appointments ,</l>
     <l n="124">And are fast curing by my ointments :</l>
     <l n="125">Thus , from their praise , I hope to claim</l>
     <l n="126">An added honour to my name .</l>
     <l n="127">Nor are these all ; for many more }</l>
     <l n="128">Of wealth and rank pass through my door ; }</l>
     <l n="129">Though still as I have said before , }</l>
     <l n="130">They to such aid as mine apply</l>
     <l n="131">All mask 'd in fearful secrecy .</l>
     <l n="132">These whims I have explain 'd , to prove</l>
     <l n="133">I cannot in this quarter move ;</l>
     <l n="134">And where I could your worth commend</l>
     <l n="135">It would degrade you to attend .</l>
     <l n="136">But I shall now unfold to view ,</l>
     <l n="137">Another chance I have for you :</l>
     <l n="138">And let your patience ope its ear</l>

      <l n="229">It often happens as we range</l>

      <l n="283">Indeed he knew the means that made ‘ em ,</l>

    <head>QUAE GENUS WITH A QUACK DOCTOR . ]</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Patients that morning had been plenty ,</l>
     <l n="2">Not less it seems than five-and-twenty ;</l>
     <l n="3">This the old woman smiling stated ,</l>
     <l n="4">And told him that the dinner waited .</l>
     <l n="5">The table shew 'd a plenteous treat }</l>
     <l n="6">Of fish and fowl and sav'ry meat , }</l>
     <l n="7">But poor QUAE GENUS scarce could eat . }</l>
     <l n="8">For , though prepar 'd for any diet ,</l>
     <l n="9">His hunger soon repos 'd in quiet .</l>
     <l n="10">The Doctor fed , but talk 'd the while ,</l>
     <l n="11">Of gastric juice and flowing bile ;</l>
     <l n="12">Of kidneys and o'ergrowing liver ,</l>
     <l n="13">As of sore eyes now cur 'd for ever ;</l>
     <l n="14">What his fam 'd Nostrum had perform 'd ,</l>
     <l n="15">And how it had the bowels storm 'd</l>
     <l n="16">Of guttling Gourmand with such force ,</l>
     <l n="17">That it a passage made of course ,</l>
     <l n="18">Which three great Doctors tried in vain ,</l>
     <l n="19">With all their boasted skill to gain .</l>
     <l n="20">Besides our hero did not know</l>
     <l n="21">How cookery went on below ,</l>
     <l n="22">And he might think , poor dainty sinner ,</l>
     <l n="23">That the same hands had dress 'd the dinner ,</l>
     <l n="24">Which were entrusted with the care</l>
     <l n="25">Each daily med'cine to prepare ;</l>
     <l n="26">To melt the salves and spread anon</l>
     <l n="27">The cerates and diacolon ;</l>
     <l n="28">That did the drugs or grind or pound ,</l>
     <l n="29">And dress the sore leg 's running wound :</l>
     <l n="30">But so it was , a sick sensation</l>
     <l n="31">Check 'd all his powers of mastication ,</l>
     <l n="32">And caus 'd his stomach to resent</l>
     <l n="33">The very taste of nutriment :</l>
     <l n="34">Nay his sad appetite approv 'd</l>
     <l n="35">When all the dishes were remov 'd .</l>
     <l n="36">— They therefore soon had ceas 'd to dine }</l>
     <l n="37">And o'er the second pint of wine }</l>
     <l n="38">The bargain clos 'd with ANODYNE . }</l>
     <l n="39">What that was , it is fit to know ,</l>
     <l n="40">And the verse now will briefly show .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="41">QUAE GENUS had made up his mind</l>
     <l n="42">Not to his interest to be blind ;</l>
     <l n="43">But in the game that path pursue</l>
     <l n="44">Which prudence says we ought to do ,</l>
     <l n="45">Nor to let scruples overpower</l>
     <l n="46">Th ’ advantage of the passing hour ,</l>
     <l n="47">And yet that artifice restrain</l>
     <l n="48">Whose daily efforts are for gain :</l>
     <l n="49">In short to take the middle plan , }</l>
     <l n="50">Which , as the world is us 'd to scan , }</l>
     <l n="51">Marks what is call 'd an Honest Man . }</l>
     <l n="52">He might not hesitate complying</l>
     <l n="53">With a small spice of useful lying</l>
     <l n="54">That idle questions might disarm ,</l>
     <l n="55">Do some slight good , but never harm ,</l>
     <l n="56">Afford a sentimental grace</l>
     <l n="57">To conversation 's common place ,</l>
     <l n="58">And give a customary aid</l>
     <l n="59">To all the retail slang of trade .</l>
     <l n="60">With mind thus settled and prepar 'd</l>
     <l n="61">He ANODYNE 'S first lecture heard .</l>
     <l n="62">And as it surely was the best ,</l>
     <l n="63">We shall pass over all the rest .</l>

     <l n="1">“ This the first rule that I shall trace :—</l>
     <l n="2">You must command a solemn face ;</l>
     <l n="3">Nor suffer objects to beguile</l>
     <l n="4">Your features to familiar smile .</l>
     <l n="5">Here , I must own , you oft may see</l>
     <l n="6">What may court transient pleasantry ;</l>
     <l n="7">For e'en ‘ midst misery and pain ,</l>
     <l n="8">You 'll find such whims and fancies reign ,</l>
     <l n="9">Hear patients cough and grunt and sneeze</l>
     <l n="10">In such uncouth , discordant keys ,</l>
     <l n="11">That without care , I should not wonder</l>
     <l n="12">Your muscles into laugh might blunder .</l>
     <l n="13">You have a speech runs off at score ,</l>
     <l n="14">As rapid as a chaise and four ,</l>
     <l n="15">But with my sickly folk be slow</l>
     <l n="16">As a stage-waggon 's us 'd to go ;</l>
     <l n="17">And pray remember to apply</l>
     <l n="18">Your words with due solemnity .</l>
     <l n="19">I know you well can suit your tongue</l>
     <l n="20">To any age , to old or young ;</l>
     <l n="21">Nor will the task your care perplex</l>
     <l n="22">In the complaints of either sex ;</l>
     <l n="23">And bear in mind , whate'er you see ,</l>
     <l n="24">To veil your thoughts with modesty :</l>

     <l n="84">Such various claimants will rush in ,</l>
     <l n="85">Such troops of distant , country cousins ,</l>

     <l n="110">A decent fortune they had made ;</l>
     <l n="111">But as it was , their transient gain</l>
     <l n="112">Gave them no reason to complain .</l>
     <l n="113">— Now , ere twelve months or more were past ,</l>
     <l n="114">JOHN SQUEEZE , alas ! had breath 'd his last ;</l>
     <l n="115">And though they search 'd the mansion round ,</l>
     <l n="116">A Will was no where to be found ;</l>
     <l n="117">And relatives in numbers came ,</l>
     <l n="118">Their rights to prove , their shares to claim ;</l>
     <l n="119">While the shrewd Miss AMELIA SQUEEZE</l>
     <l n="120">Lock 'd ev'ry box and kept the keys .</l>
     <l n="121">— With angry threats the house resounded ,</l>
     <l n="122">It was confusion worse confounded ;</l>

     <l n="124">Calmly beheld their idle ravings ,</l>
     <l n="125">As different ways they did pursue ,</l>
     <l n="126">Which diff'rent Lawyers bade them do .</l>
     <l n="127">— And here we cannot overlook</l>
     <l n="128">The wary way the lady took .</l>
     <l n="129">Her favourite swain , it must be known ,</l>
     <l n="130">A Pleader was of some renown ;</l>
     <l n="131">To whom this offer she propos 'd ,</l>
     <l n="132">With which the learned Lawyer clos 'd .</l>
     <l n="133">“ If of the wealth of Old JOHN SQUEEZE ,</l>

     <l n="136">My charms and fortune you shall share . ”</l>
     <l n="137">— Thus she was left amid the paws</l>
     <l n="138">Of Lawyers and the tardy Laws ,</l>
     <l n="139">With chance that when ten years were past ,</l>
     <l n="140">A husband she might get at last .</l>

     <l n="154">Offered him his vacant place .</l>

     <l n="172">Custom or fashion ne'er refuses ;</l>
     <l n="173">When soon again the plate is seen ,</l>
     <l n="174">The silver-smith has made it clean ,</l>
     <l n="175">And in a week , or month , or so ,</l>
     <l n="176">It will resume its usual show .</l>

    <head>QUAE GENUS GIVES A GRAND PARTY . ]</head>

     <l n="1">Miss Emily , the blooming niece }</l>
     <l n="2">Of the old Broker , Master Squeeze , }</l>
     <l n="3">Who made some figure in the piece , }</l>
     <l n="4">And , at no very distant page ,</l>
     <l n="5">Was seen to figure on the stage ;</l>
     <l n="6">The Lady all her points had carried ,</l>
     <l n="7">Was rich , and had the Pleader married ;</l>
     <l n="8">Had chang 'd her uncle 's name of Squeeze'em</l>
     <l n="9">To her shrewd husband 's , Lawyer Seize'em :</l>
     <l n="10">Who , by his cunning and his skill ,</l>
     <l n="11">Had brought all contests to her will ,</l>
     <l n="12">When he had got his promis 'd fee</l>
     <l n="13">Of Beauty , Wealth and Luxury .</l>
     <l n="14">To her , with smiles of gay content ,</l>
     <l n="15">The ‘ Squire his eager footsteps bent ,</l>
     <l n="16">And did in lofty tone proclaim</l>
     <l n="17">His change of fortune as of name ;</l>
     <l n="18">And told her it would be his pride ,</l>
     <l n="19">At a small Fete would she preside ,</l>
     <l n="20">Which he propos 'd in style to give ,</l>
     <l n="21">Where he would all her friends receive ;</l>
     <l n="22">For this was now the only way</l>
     <l n="23">He had to make his party gay :</l>
     <l n="24">And the first flourish of his plan</l>
     <l n="25">To figure as a Gentleman .</l>
     <l n="26">— She smil 'd and said she 'd bring him plenty ,</l>
     <l n="27">Then ask 'd at once his cards for twenty .</l>
     <l n="28">— The fete was given ,— the dance , the song ,</l>
     <l n="29">And feasting did the night prolong ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which pleasure gave to full two score ,</l>
     <l n="31">Whom he had never seen before ;—</l>
     <l n="32">But , his great object to maintain ,</l>
     <l n="33">These he must strive to see again ;</l>
     <l n="34">At all their doors his cards present ,</l>
     <l n="35">And thus , by various compliment ,</l>
     <l n="36">To form a circle of such friends</l>
     <l n="37">As would secure his serious ends ,</l>
     <l n="38">In social ease to pass the day ,</l>
     <l n="39">And often find an evening gay .</l>
     <l n="40">— But ‘ Squire Free-born quickly found</l>
     <l n="41">He did not tread on solid ground ,</l>
     <l n="42">And ‘ gan to fear he should not see</l>
     <l n="43">The way to that society ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which forms of life the happiest measure :</l>
     <l n="45">By mutual interchange of pleasure .</l>
     <l n="46">— ‘ Twas but slight chat if he should meet</l>
     <l n="47">His new acquaintance in the street ;</l>
     <l n="48">He seldom found , or more or less ,</l>
     <l n="49">But gen'ral forms of politesse ,</l>
     <l n="50">And that , too often , at the best ,</l>
     <l n="51">Was but in flimsy style exprest .</l>
     <l n="52">— Ladies would ask him to the play ,</l>
     <l n="53">To take his arm and let him pay ;</l>
     <l n="54">And when to cards , he always lost</l>
     <l n="55">More than the wine and biscuits cost .</l>
     <l n="56">He found , as yet , but little done —</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Twas neither common sense nor fun ,</l>
     <l n="58">Where kind regard would ne'er encrease ,</l>
     <l n="59">And int'rest wak 'd the wish to please ;</l>
     <l n="60">Where words were either cold or hearty ,</l>
     <l n="61">As he propos 'd to give a party ;</l>
     <l n="62">And a good supper was the charm</l>
     <l n="63">That did to transient friendship warm ,</l>
     <l n="64">For that , alas , no longer lasted ,</l>

     <l n="66">‘ Squire Free-born soon began to feel</l>
     <l n="67">A relaxation in his zeal</l>
     <l n="68">To push away that class among</l>
     <l n="69">Who did his evening parties throng ,</l>
     <l n="70">From whom no fair return was made ,</l>
     <l n="71">And mod'rate fashion was display 'd .</l>
     <l n="72">Manners were ap 'd , but in a way</l>
     <l n="73">That did vulgarity betray ;</l>
     <l n="74">And the best show that he might see ,</l>
     <l n="75">Was dash of awkward finery :—</l>
     <l n="76">Besides , a rude and rough event</l>
     <l n="77">Gave spirit to his discontent .</l>
     <l n="78">— He call 'd , one day , where , on admission ,</l>
     <l n="79">The parties were in sad condition ;</l>
     <l n="80">It was a scene of mutual flame ,</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tween Start-up and his lovely dame .</l>
     <l n="82">He was a clerk on public duty ,</l>
     <l n="83">And she a most conceited beauty :</l>
     <l n="84">When , as he enter 'd , her sharp tongue</l>
     <l n="85">Began in tones both harsh and strong ,—</l>
     <l n="86">“ Pray , FREE-BORN , do you think it breeding ,</l>
     <l n="87">That he should thus be always reading ?</l>
     <l n="88">When he does from his office come</l>
     <l n="89">‘ Tis thus he sits hum-drum at home ,</l>
     <l n="90">As if he thought so low my wit</l>
     <l n="91">I 'm not for conversation fit ;</l>
     <l n="92">Nor does he seem to rate me higher</l>
     <l n="93">Than to trace figures in the fire ! ”</l>
     <l n="94">— “ Call you , hum-drum , that information</l>
     <l n="95">So suited to official station , ”</l>
     <l n="96">He sternly said , “ which now engages</l>
     <l n="97">Attention to these curious pages ! ”</l>
     <l n="98">— “ My mind , ” she cried , “ was in the dark</l>
     <l n="99">When I was married to a Clerk :—</l>
     <l n="100">O had I join 'd a fool instead</l>
     <l n="101">Of one to office breeding bred !</l>
     <l n="102">He , who in honour should protect me ,</l>
     <l n="103">You see , Sir , how he dares neglect me ! ”</l>
     <l n="104">— In terms polite to praise and blame ,</l>
     <l n="105">Free-born now hop 'd to quench the flame ,</l>
     <l n="106">And therefore offer 'd , nothing loth ,</l>

     <l n="221">He did on the strange vision gaze ,</l>
     <l n="222">While the bold reprobate intrusion</l>
     <l n="223">Threw all the house into confusion .</l>
     <l n="224">In rush 'd domestics one and all ,</l>
