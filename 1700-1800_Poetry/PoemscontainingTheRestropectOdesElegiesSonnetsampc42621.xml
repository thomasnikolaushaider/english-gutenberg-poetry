   <p>“ Good Reader , many things hath beene written by many men , and the over-cloying humor of this age hath so overburdened the world with multiplicity of al kinds , that scarce there is one subject left upon the head whereof a hundred have not trampled over : amongst which impartial handling , it may bee possible that some one corner hath escaped this scrutenous search , and beene raked over with a lighter hand than other . ”</p>
   <p>We feel the justice of this remark as applicable to modern poetry . Much novelty cannot be expected . In submitting the following volume to the public , we attempt neither to prejudice them in its favour , or supplicate them in behalf of its faults .</p>

     <l n="1">................ “ On life 's wide plain</l>
     <l n="2">Cast friendless , where unheard some sufferer cries</l>
     <l n="3">Hourly , and oft our road is lone and long ,</l>
     <l n="4">Twere not a crime , should we awhile delay</l>
     <l n="5">Amid the sunny field ; and happier they ,</l>

    <head>BOWLES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">As on I journey through the vale of years ,</l>
     <l n="2">Cheer 'd by fond hopes , and chill 'd by doubtful fears ;</l>
     <l n="3">Allow me , Memory , in thy treasur 'd store ,</l>
     <l n="4">To view those days that will return no more :</l>
     <l n="5">Oh ! let thy vivid pencil call to view</l>
     <l n="6">Each distant scene , each long-past hour anew ,</l>
     <l n="7">Ere yet my bosom knew the touch of grief ,</l>
     <l n="8">Ere yet my bosom lov 'd the lyre 's relief .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Yes , as thou dart'st thine intellectual ray ,</l>
     <l n="10">The clouds of mental darkness melt away :</l>
     <l n="11">So when , at earliest day 's awaking dawn ,</l>
     <l n="12">The hovering mists obscure the dewy lawn ,</l>
     <l n="13">O'er all the champain spread their influence chill ,</l>
     <l n="14">Hang o'er the vale , and hide the lofty hill ;</l>
     <l n="15">Anon , slow rising , beams the orb of day ,</l>
     <l n="16">Slow melt the shadowy mists , and fade away ;</l>
     <l n="17">The vapours vanish at the view of morn ,</l>
     <l n="18">And hang in dew-drops on the glistening thorn ;</l>
     <l n="19">The prospect opens on the pilgrim 's sight ,</l>
     <l n="20">And hills , and vales , and woods , reflect the beam of light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="21">O thou ! the mistress of my future days ,</l>
     <l n="22">Accept thy minstrel 's retrospective lays ;</l>
     <l n="23">To whom the minstrel and the lyre belong ,</l>
     <l n="24">Accept , ARISTE , Memory 's pensive song !</l>
     <l n="25">For Memory on thine image loves to hang ,</l>
     <l n="26">Heave the sad sigh , and point the piercing pang .</l>
     <l n="27">Of long-past days I sing , ere yet I knew</l>
     <l n="28">Or grief and care , or happiness and you ;</l>
     <l n="29">Ere yet my infant bosom learnt to prove</l>
     <l n="30">The pangs of absence , and the hopes of love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">So when the pilgrim , on his journey bent ,</l>
     <l n="32">With upward toil creeps on the steep ascent ;</l>
     <l n="33">Ere yet his feet the destin 'd height attain ,</l>
     <l n="34">Oft will he pause , and gaze the journey 'd plain ;</l>
     <l n="35">Oft pause again , the valley to survey ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where food or slumber sooth 'd his wand'ring way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="37">ALSTON ! twelve years , in various business fled ,</l>
     <l n="38">Have wing 'd their restless flight o'er BION 's head ;</l>
     <l n="39">Twelve years have taught his opening mind to know</l>
     <l n="40">The smiles of pleasure , and the frowns of woe ;</l>
     <l n="41">Since in thy vale , beneath the master 's rule ,</l>
     <l n="42">He roam 'd an inmate of the village school :</l>
     <l n="43">Yet still will memory 's busy eye retrace</l>
     <l n="44">Each well-known vestige of the oft-trod place ;</l>
     <l n="45">Each wonted haunt , each scene of youthful joy ,</l>
     <l n="46">Where merriment has cheer 'd the careless boy :</l>
     <l n="47">Well pleas 'd will memory still the spot survey ,</l>
     <l n="48">Where once he triumph 'd in the infant play ,</l>
     <l n="49">Without one care where every morn he rose ,</l>
     <l n="50">Where every evening sunk to calm repose .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">Large was the mansion , fall'n by varying fate</l>
     <l n="52">From lordly grandeur and manorial state ;</l>
     <l n="53">Where once the manor 's lord supreme had rule ,</l>
     <l n="54">Now reign 'd the master of the village school :</l>
     <l n="55">No more was heard around , at earliest morn ,</l>
     <l n="56">The echoing clangor of the huntsman 's horn ;</l>
     <l n="57">No more the eager hounds , with deep'ning cry ,</l>
     <l n="58">Yell 'd in the exulting hope of pastime nigh ;</l>
     <l n="59">The squire no more obey 'd the morning call ,</l>
     <l n="60">Nor favourite spaniels fill 'd the sportsman 's hall ;</l>
     <l n="61">For he , the last descendant of his race ,</l>
     <l n="62">Slept with his fathers , and forgot the chace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="63">Fall'n was the mansion : o'er the village poor</l>
     <l n="64">The lordly landlord tyrannized no more ;</l>
     <l n="65">For now , in petty greatness o'er the school ,</l>
     <l n="66">The mighty master held despotic rule :</l>
     <l n="67">With trembling silence all his deeds we saw ,</l>
     <l n="68">His look a mandate , and his word a law ;</l>
     <l n="69">Severe his voice , severely grave his mien ,</l>
     <l n="70">And wond'rous strict he was , and wond'rous wise , I ween .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="71">Even now , thro ’ many a long long year , I trace</l>
     <l n="72">The hour when first in awe I view 'd his face ;</l>
     <l n="73">Even now recall my entrance at the dome ,</l>
     <l n="74">‘ Twas the first day I ever left my home !</l>
     <l n="75">Years intervening have not worn away</l>
     <l n="76">The deep remembrance of that distant day ;</l>
     <l n="77">Effac 'd the vestige of my earliest fears ,</l>
     <l n="78">A mother 's fondness , and a mother 's tears ;</l>
     <l n="79">When close she prest me to her sorrowing heart ,</l>
     <l n="80">As loath as even I myself to part .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="81">But time to youthful sorrow yields relief ,</l>
     <l n="82">Each various object weans the child from grief :</l>
     <l n="83">Like April showers the tears of youth descend ,</l>
     <l n="84">Sudden they fall , and suddenly they end ;</l>
     <l n="85">Serener pleasure gilds the following hour ,</l>
     <l n="86">As brighter gleams the sun when past the April shower .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="87">Methinks ev'n now the interview I see ,</l>
     <l n="88">Recall the mistress ’ smile , the master 's glee :</l>
     <l n="89">Much of my future happiness they said ,</l>
     <l n="90">Much of the easy life the scholars led ;</l>
     <l n="91">Of spacious play-ground , and of wholsome air ,</l>
     <l n="92">The best instruction , and the tenderest care ;</l>
     <l n="93">And when I follow 'd from the garden door</l>
     <l n="94">My father , ‘ till with tears I saw no more ,</l>
     <l n="95">How civilly they eas 'd my parting pain ,</l>
     <l n="96">And never spake so civilly again !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="97">Why loves the soul on earlier years to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="98">When memory spreads around her saddening spell ;</l>
     <l n="99">When discontent , with sullen gloom o'ercast ,</l>
     <l n="100">Loaths at the present , and prefers the past ?</l>
     <l n="101">Why calls reflection to my pensive view</l>
     <l n="102">Each trifling act of infancy anew —</l>
     <l n="103">Each trifling act with pleasure pondering o'er ,</l>
     <l n="104">Even at the time when trifles please no more !</l>
     <l n="105">Day follows day , yet leaves no trace behind ,</l>
     <l n="106">When one sole thought engrosses all the mind ;</l>
     <l n="107">When anxious reason claims her painful sway ,</l>
     <l n="108">And for to-morrow 's prospect glooms to-day !</l>
     <l n="109">Ill fares the wanderer in this vale of life ,</l>
     <l n="110">When each new stage affords succeeding strife ;</l>
     <l n="111">In every stage he feels supremely curst ,</l>
     <l n="112">Yet still the present evil seems the worst :</l>
     <l n="113">On as he goes the vision 'd prospect flies ,</l>
     <l n="114">And , grasping still at bliss , unblest at last he dies .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="115">Yet is remembrance sweet ; though well I know</l>
     <l n="116">The days of childhood are but days of woe ;</l>
     <l n="117">Some rude restraint , some petty tyrant sours</l>
     <l n="118">The tranquil calm of childhood 's easy hours ;</l>
     <l n="119">Some trifling fault committed calls the tear ,</l>
     <l n="120">Some trifling task neglected prompts to fear :</l>
     <l n="121">Yet is it sweet to call to mind the hour ,</l>
     <l n="122">Ere searching reason gain 'd her saddening power ;</l>
     <l n="123">Ere future prospects could the soul distress ,</l>
     <l n="124">When even ignorance was happiness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="125">Such was my state in those remember 'd years ,</l>
     <l n="126">When one small acre bounded all my fears :</l>
     <l n="127">And even now with pleasure I recall</l>
     <l n="128">The tapestry 'd school , the bright-brown boarded hall ;</l>
     <l n="129">The murmuring brook , that every morning saw</l>
     <l n="130">The due observance of the cleanly law ;</l>
     <l n="131">The walnuts , where , when favour would allow ,</l>
     <l n="132">Full oft I wont to search each well-stript bough ;</l>
     <l n="133">The crab-tree , whence we hid the secret hoard ,</l>
     <l n="134">With roasted crabs to deck the wintry board .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="135">These trifling pastimes then my soul possest ,</l>
     <l n="136">These trifling objects still remain imprest :</l>
     <l n="137">So when , with unskill 'd hand , the rustic hind</l>
     <l n="138">Carves the rude legend on the growing rind ,</l>
     <l n="139">In after years the peasant lives to see</l>
     <l n="140">The expanded legend grow as grows the tree .</l>
     <l n="141">Though every winter 's desolating sway</l>
     <l n="142">Shake the hoarse grove , and sweep the leaves away ;</l>
     <l n="143">Deep in its trunk the legend still will last ,</l>
     <l n="144">Defy the storm , and brave the wintry blast .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="145">Whilst letter 'd travellers delight to roam</l>
     <l n="146">The time-torn temple and demolish 'd dome ;</l>
     <l n="147">Stray with the Arab o'er the wreck of time ,</l>
     <l n="148">Where erst Palmyra 's towers arose sublime ;</l>
     <l n="149">Or mark the lazy Turk 's lethargic pride ,</l>
     <l n="150">And Grecian slavery on Ilyssus ’ side :</l>
     <l n="151">Oh ! be it mine to flee from empire 's strife ,</l>
     <l n="152">And mark the changes of domestic life ;</l>
     <l n="153">See the fall'n scenes where once I bore my part ,</l>
     <l n="154">Where every change of fortune strikes the heart ;</l>
     <l n="155">As when the merry bells ’ responsive sound</l>
     <l n="156">Proclaim the news of victory around ;</l>
     <l n="157">When eager patriots fly the news to spread</l>
     <l n="158">Of glorious conquest , and of thousands dead ;</l>
     <l n="159">All feel the mighty glow of victor joy ,</l>
     <l n="160">Exult in blood , and triumph to destroy :</l>
     <l n="161">But if extended on the gory plain ,</l>
     <l n="162">And , snatch 'd in conquest , some lov 'd friend be slain ,</l>
     <l n="163">Affection 's tears will dim the sorrowing eye ,</l>
     <l n="164">And suffering nature grieve that one should die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="165">Oft have my footsteps roam 'd the sacred spot ,</l>
     <l n="166">Where heroes , kings , and minstrels , sleep forgot ;</l>
     <l n="167">Oft traced the mouldering castle 's ivy 'd wall ,</l>
     <l n="168">Or ruin 'd convent tottering to its fall ;</l>
     <l n="169">Whilst sad reflection lov 'd the solemn gloom ,</l>
     <l n="170">Paus 'd o'er the pile , and ponder 'd on the tomb :</l>
     <l n="171">Yet never had my bosom felt such pain</l>
     <l n="172">As , ALSTON , when I saw thy scenes again !</l>
     <l n="173">For every long-lost pleasure rush 'd to view ,</l>
     <l n="174">For every long-past sorrow rose anew ;</l>
     <l n="175">Where whilome all were friends , I stood alone ,</l>
     <l n="176">Unknowing all I saw , of all I saw unknown .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="17">
     <l n="177">ALSTON ! no pilgrim ever crept around</l>
     <l n="178">With more emotion Sion 's sacred ground ,</l>
     <l n="179">Than fill 'd my heart as slow I saunter 'd o'er</l>
     <l n="180">Those fields my infant steps had trod of yore ;</l>
