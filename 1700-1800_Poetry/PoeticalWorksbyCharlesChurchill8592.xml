    <head>CHURCHILL — HIS LIFE AND WRITINGS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">In Churchill we find a signal specimen of a considerable class of</l>
     <l n="2">writers , concerning whom Goldsmith 's words are true —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">“ Who , born for the universe , narrow 'd their mind ,</l>
     <l n="4">And to party gave up what was meant for mankind . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Possessed of powers and natural endowments which might have made him , under favourable circumstances , a poet , a hero , a man , and a saint , he became , partly through his own fault , and partly through the force of destiny , a satirist , an unfortunate politician , a profligate , died early ; and we must approach his corpse , as men do those of Burns and Byron , with sorrow , wonder , admiration , and blame , blended into one strange , complex , and yet not unnatural emotion . Like them , his life was short and unhappy — his career triumphant , yet checquered — his powers uncultivated — his passions unchecked — his poetry only a partial discovery of his genius — his end sudden and melancholy — and his reputation , and future place in the history of letters , hitherto somewhat uncertain . And yet , like them , his very faults and errors , both as a man and a poet , have acted , with many , as nails , fastening to a “ sure place ” his reputation and the effect of his genius .</p>
   <p>Charles Churchill was born in Vine Street , Westminster , in February 1731 . He was the eldest son of the Rev . Charles Churchill , a rector in Essex , as well as a curate , and lecturer of St John the Evangelist , Westminster . As to the attainments of the poet 's father , we know only that he was qualified to superintend the studies of the son , during the intervals of public tuition . At eight years of age , he was sent to Westminster School , and placed under the care of Dr Nichols and Dr Pierson Lloyd , where his proficiency in classical lore was by no means remarkable ; nor did he give any promise of the brilliance which afterwards distinguished his genius . At fifteen , he stood as candidate for admission to the foundation at Westminster , and carried it triumphantly . Shortly after , having by some misdemeanour displeased the masters , he was compelled to compose , and recite in the school-room , a poetical declamation in Latin , by way of penance . This he accomplished in a masterly manner — to the astonishment of his masters , and the delight of his school-fellows — some of whom became afterwards distinguished men . We can fancy the scene at the day of the recitation — the grave and big-wigged schoolmasters looking grimly on — their aspect , however , becoming softer and brighter , as one large hexameter rolls out after another — the strong , awkward , ugly boy , unblushingly pouring forth his energetic lines — cheered by the sight of the relaxing gravity of his teachers ’ looks — while around , you see the bashful tremulous figure of poor Cowper , the small thin shape and bright eye of Warren Hastings , and the waggish countenance of Colman — all eagerly watching the reciter — and all , at last , distended and brightened with joy at his signal triumph .</p>
   <p>At the age of eighteen , he stood for a fellowship in Merton College , but without success — being defeated by older candidates . Shortly after , he applied for matriculation at the University of Oxford , but is SAID to have been rejected at his examination , in which , instead of answering the questions proposed , he broke out into satirical reflections on the abilities of his judges . From Oxford he repaired to Cambridge , where he was admitted into Trinity College . Here , however , his stay was very short ,— he was probably repelled by the chevaux-de-frise of the mathematics ;— and in a few weeks he returned to London , disgusted at both universities , shaking their dust off his feet , and , perhaps , vowing vengeance against them — a vow which he has kept in his poetry . In his “ Ghost , ” for instance , he thus ridiculed those forms of admission —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Which Balaam 's ass</l>
     <l n="2">As well as Balaam 's self might pass ,</l>
     <l n="3">And with his master take degrees ,</l>
     <l n="4">Could he contrive to pay the fees . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Penniless , and soured by disappointment , Churchill returned to his father 's house ; and , being idle , soon obtained work from the proverbial “ taskmaster ” of all idle people . Having become acquainted with a young lady , named Scott , whose father lived in the vicinity of Westminster School , he , with true poetic imprudence , married her privately in the Fleet , to the great annoyance of both their parents . His father , however , was much attached to and proud of his son , and at last was reconciled to the match , and took the young couple home . Churchill passed one quiet domestic year under the paternal roof . At its termination — for reasons which are not known — he retired to Sunderland , in the north of England , and seems there to have applied himself enthusiastically to the study of poetry — commencing , at the same time , a course of theological reading , with a view to the Church . He remained in Sunderland till the year 1753 , when he came back to London to take possession of a small fortune which accrued to him through his wife . He had now reached the age of twenty-two , and had been three years married .</p>
   <p>During the residence in the metropolis which succeeded , he frequented the theatres , and came thus in contact with a field where he was to gather his earliest and most untarnished laurels . In “ The Rosciad , ” we find the results of several years ’ keen and close observation of the actors of the period , collected into one focus , and pointed and irradiated by the power of genius . As Scott , while carelessly galloping in his youth through Liddesdale , and listening to ballads and old-world stories , was “ making himself ” into the mighty minstrel of the border — so this big , clumsy , overgrown student , seated in the pit of Drury Lane , or exalted to the one-shilling gallery of Covent Garden , was silently growing into the greatest poet of the stage that , perhaps , ever lived .</p>
   <p>Soon after , he was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Bath and Wells , on the curacy of Cadbury , in Somersetshire , where he immediately removed , and entered on a career of active ministerial work . Such were the golden opinions he gained in Cadbury , that , in 1756 , although he had taken no degree , nor could be said to have studied at either of the universities , he was ordained priest by Dr Sherlock , the Bishop of London ( celebrated for his Sermons and his “ Trial of the Witnesses ” ) , on his father 's curacy of Rainham , Essex . Here he continued diligent in his pastoral duties — blameless in his conduct , and attentive to his theological studies . He seemed to have entirely escaped from the suction of the stage — to have forsworn the Muses , and to have turned the eye of his ambition away from the peaks of Parnassus to the summit of the Bishops ’ Bench .</p>
   <p>But for Churchill 's poor circumstances , it is likely that he would have reached this elevation , as surely as did his great contemporary , and the object of his implacable hatred and abuse , William Warburton . But his early marriage , and his increasing responsibilities , produced pecuniary embarrassments , and these must have tended gradually to sour him against his profession , and to prepare his mind for that rupture with it which ultimately ensued . To support himself and his family , he opened a school , and met with considerable encouragement — although we suspect that his scholars felt something of the spirit of the future satirist stirring in the motions of his rod , and that he who afterwards lashed his century did not spare his school . In the year 1758 , his amiable and excellent father died , and ( a striking testimony both to his own and his son 's early worth ) Charles was unanimously chosen to be his father 's successor in the curacy and lectureship of St John 's . There he laboured for a time , according to some statements , with much punctuality , energy , and acceptance . After “ The Rosciad ” had established his name , he sold ten of the sermons he had preached in St John 's to a bookseller for £ 250 . We have not read them ; but Dr Kippis has pronounced them utterly unworthy of their author 's fame — without a single gleam of his poetic fire — so poor , indeed , that he supposes that they were borrowed from some dull elderly divine , if not from Churchill 's own father . This reminds us of a story which was lately communicated to us about the famous William Godwin . He , too , succeeded his father in his pastoral charge . Tinged , however , already with heterodox views , he was by no means so popular as his father had been . His own sermons were exceedingly cold and dry , but he possessed a chestful of his father 's , and used to read them frequently , by way of grateful change to his hearers . The sermons of the elder Godwin were recognised by the orthodoxy of their sentiment , and the dinginess of their colour , and were much relished ; and so long as the stock lasted , the future author of “ Caleb Williams ” commanded a tolerable audience ; but so soon as he had read them all , and resumed his own lucubrations , his hearers melted away , and he moved off to become a literateur in London . Perhaps Churchill , in like manner , may have found that general audiences like plain sense better than poetry . That he had ever much real piety or zeal has been gravely doubted , and we share in the doubts . But although he himself speaks slightingly , in one of his latter poems , of his ministerial labours , he at least played his part with outward decorum . His great objection to the office was still his small salary , which amounted to scarcely £ 100 per annum . This compelled him to resume the occupation of a tutor , first to the young ladies attending a boarding-school in Queen Square , Bloomsbury , and then to several young gentlemen who were prosecuting the study of the classics .</p>
   <p>When about twenty-seven years of age , he renewed his acquaintance with Robert Lloyd , the son of Dr Lloyd , one of the masters of Westminster School , and who had been an early chum of Churchill 's . This young man had discovered very promising abilities , alike at Westminster and at Cambridge , and had been appointed usher in his father 's seminary ; but , sick of the drudgery , and infected with a fierce thirst both for fame and pleasure , had flung himself upon the literary arena . Although far inferior to Churchill in genius , and indeed little better than a clever copyist of his manner , he exerted a very pernicious influence on his friend 's conduct . He borrowed inspiration from Churchill , and gave him infamy in exchange . The poet could do nothing by halves . Along with Lloyd , he rushed into a wild career of dissipation . He became a nightly frequenter of the theatres , taverns , and worse haunts . His wife , with whom , after the first year , he never seems to have been happy , instead of checking , outran her husband in extravagance and imprudence . He got deeply involved in debt , and was repeatedly in danger of imprisonment , till Dr Lloyd , his friend 's father , nobly stept forward to his relief , persuaded his creditors to accept five shillings in the pound , and himself lent what was required to complete the sum . It is said that , when afterwards Churchill had made money by the sale of his poems , he voluntarily paid the whole of the original debt .</p>
   <p>Along with the new love of indulgence , there had arisen in his bosom the old love of verse . Stimulated by intercourse with Lloyd , Colman , B. Thornton , and other wits of the period , he had written a poem , in Hudibrastic rhyme , entitled “ The Bard . ” This he offered to one Waller , a bookseller in Fleet Street , who rejected it with scorn . In this feeling Churchill seems afterwards to have shared , as he never would consent to its publication . Not at all discouraged , he sat down and wrote a satire entitled “ The Conclave , ” directed against the Dean and Chapter of Westminster ,— Dr Zachary Pearce , a favourite of Churchill 's ire , being then Dean . This would have been published but for the fear of legal proceedings . It was extremely personal and severe . His third effort was destined to be more successful . This was “ The Rosciad , ” written , it is said , after two months ’ close attendance on the theatres . This excessively clever satire he offered to various booksellers , some say for twenty pounds , others for five guineas . It was refused , and he had to print it at his own expense . It appeared , without his name , in March 1761 . Churchill now , like Byron , “ awoke one morning and found himself famous . ” A few days convinced him and all men that a decided hit had been made , and that a strong new satirist had burst , like a comet , into the sky —</p>
   <p>“ With fear of change perplexing ” players .</p>
   <p>The effect was prodigious . The critics admired — the victims of his satire writhed and raved — the public greedily bought , and all cried out , “ Who can this be ? ” The Critical Review , then conducted by Smollett , alone opposed the general opinion . It accused Colman and Lloyd of having concocted “ The Rosciad , ” for the purpose of puffing themselves . This compelled Churchill to quit his mask . He announced his name as the author of the poem , and as preparing another — his “ Apology ” — addressed to the Critical Reviewers , which accordingly appeared ere the close of April . It proved a second bombshell , cast into the astonished town . Smollett was keenly assailed in it , and had to write to Churchill , through Garrick , that he was not the writer of the obnoxious critique . Garrick , himself the hero of “ The Rosciad , ” was here rather broadly reminded that heroes are mortal , and that kings may be dethroned , and had to make humiliating concessions to the fearless satirist . Fearless , indeed , and strong he required to be , for many of his victims had vowed loud and deep to avenge their quarrel by inflicting corporal chastisement on their foe . He armed himself with a huge bludgeon , however , and stalked abroad and returned home unharmed and unattempted . None cared to meddle with such a brawny Hercules .</p>
   <p>In another way his enemies soon had their revenge . He had gained one thousand pounds by his two poems , and this supplied him with the materials of unlimited indulgence , which he did not fail to use . He threw off every restraint . He donned , instead of his clerical costume , a blue coat and gold-laced waistcoat . He separated from his wife , giving her , indeed , a handsome allowance . His midnight potations became deeper and more habitual . Dean Zachary Pearce , afterwards Bishop of Rochester , in vain remonstrated . At last , on his parishioners taking the matter up , and raising an outcry as to his neglect of duty , and the unbecoming character of his dress , he resigned his curacy and lectureship , and became for the rest of his life a literary and dissipated “ man about town . ”</p>
   <p>In October 1761 he published a poem entitled “ Night , ” addressed to Lloyd , in which , while seeking to vindicate himself from the charges against his morale , he in reality glories in his shame . His sudden celebrity had perhaps acted as a glare of light , revealing faults that might have been overlooked in an obscure person . With his dissipation , too , there mingled some elements of generosity and compassion , as in the story told of him by Charles Johnson in his “ Chrysal ” of the poet succouring a poor starving girl of the town , whom he met in the midnight streets ,— an incident reminding one of the similar stories told of Dr Johnson , and Burke , and realising the parable of the good Samaritan . Yet his conduct on the whole could not be defended .</p>
   <p>His next poem was “ The Ghost , ” which he published in parts , and continued at intervals . It was a kind of rhymed diary or waste-book , in which he deposited his every-day thoughts and feelings , without any order or plan ,— reminding us of “ Tristram Shandy ” or of “ Don Juan , ” although not so whimsically delightful as the former , nor so brilliant and poignant as the latter .</p>
   <p>But now , in 1762 , the Poet was to degrade or to sublimate into the Politician , at the bidding of that gay magician , Jack Wilkes . That this man was much better than a clever and pre-eminently lucky scoundrel , is now denied by few . He had , indeed , immense pluck and convivial pleasantry , with considerable learning and talent . But he had no principle , no character , little power of writing , and did not even possess a particle of that mob eloquence which seduces multitudes . His depravities and vices were far too gross even for that gross age . In the very height of his reputation for patriotism , he was intriguing with the ministry for a place for himself . And he became in his latter days , as Burke had predicted ( for we strongly suspect that Burke wrote the words in “ Junius ” ) , “ a silent senator , ” sate down “ infamous and contented , ” — proving that it had only been “ the tempest which had lifted him from his place . ”</p>
   <p>Wilkes introduced himself to Churchill , and they became speedily intimate . Soon after , indignant at the supremacy of Lord Bute , who , as a royal favourite , had obtained a power in the country which had not been equalled since Buckingham fell before the assassin Felton 's knife , and was employing all his influence to patronise the Scotch , Wilkes commenced the North Briton . In this , from the first , he was assisted by Churchill , who , however , did not write prose so vigorously as verse . He had sent to the North Briton a biting paper against the Scotch . On reflection , he recalled and recast it in rhyme . It was “ The Prophecy of Famine ; ” and became so popular as to make a whole nation his enemies , and all their enemies his friends . This completely filled up the measure of Churchill 's triumph . He actually dressed his youngest son in the Highland garb , took him everywhere along with him , and instructed him to say , when asked why he was thus dressed , “ Sir , my father hates the Scotch ; and does it to plague them . ”</p>
   <p>Lord Bute resigned early in 1763 , and was succeeded by a ministry comprising such men as Sir Francis Dashwood , and Lord Sandwich , who had been intimates of Wilkes , and had shared with him in certain disgusting orgies at Medmenham Abbey . They now , however , changed their tactics , and became vehement upholders of morality and religion ; and began to watch their opportunity for pouncing on their quondam associate . This he himself furnished by the famous North Briton , No . 45 . That paper may now seem , to those who read it , a not very powerful , and not very daring diatribe . But the times were inflammable — the nation was frantic with rage at the peace — the ministry were young , and willing to flesh their new-got power in some victim or other ; and Wilkes , in this paper , had now exposed himself to their fury . Warrants were instantly issued to arrest him and Churchill , as well as the publishers and printers . Wilkes was newly arrested when Churchill walked into his room . Knowing that his friend 's name was also in the warrant , he adroitly said to Churchill , “ Good morrow , Mr Thomson ; how is Mrs Thomson to-day ; does she dine in the country ? ” The poet took the hint — said that she was waiting on him — took his leave , and retired to the country accordingly .</p>
   <p>Immediately after occurred the controversy between Hogarth and our poet . While Wilkes 's case was being tried , and Chief-Justice Pratt , afterwards Lord Camden , was about to give the memorable decision in favour of the accused , and in condemnation of general warrants , Hogarth was sitting in the court , and immortalising Wilkes 's villanous squint upon the canvas . In July 1763 , Churchill avenged his friend 's quarrel by the savage personalities of his “ Epistle to William Hogarth . ” Here , while lauding highly the painter 's genius , he denounces his vanity , his envy , and makes an unmanly and brutal attack on his supposed dotage . Hogarth , within a month , replied by caricaturing Churchill as a bear with torn clerical bands , paws in ruffles , a pot of porter in his right hand , and a knot of LIES and North Britons in his left . Churchill threatened him with a renewed and severer assault in the shape of an elegy , but was dissuaded from it by his mistress .</p>
   <p>This was Miss Carr , daughter of a respectable sculptor in Westminster , whom Churchill had seduced . After a fortnight they were both struck with remorse , agreed to separate , and , through the intercession of a friend , the young lady was restored to her parents . Rendered miserable , however , by the taunts of an elder sister , she , in absolute despair , cast herself again on Churchill 's protection , and they remained together till his death . In his letters we find him , during one of his sober intervals , living quietly with her in Richmond . In “ The Conference , ” he makes some allusions to this unhappy affair , and discovers the spirit , if not of true penitence , certainly of keen remorse , and strong self-crimination . In the autumn of 1763 he became the comforter of his friend , Lloyd , in the Fleet , supported him in confinement , and opened a subscription for the discharge of his heavy debts , which , owing to the backwardness of others , proved of little service .</p>
   <p>Toward the close of this year , the North Briton was ordered to be burnt by the common hangman ; and , on the motion of Lord Sandwich , Wilkes was handed over for prosecution , for his infamous “ Essay on Woman , ” a parody on Pope 's “ Essay on Man ” — ( one Kidgell , a clergyman , had stolen a copy , and informed the Government . ) Lord Sandwich was backed by Warburton ; and the result was , Wilkes 's expulsion from the House of Commons , and his flight to France . He had previously fought a duel with one Martin , an M. P ., by whom he was severely wounded . All this furnished Churchill with matter for his “ Duellist , ” which even Horace Walpole pronounced “ glorious . ” In this vigorous production , he mercilessly lashes Martin , Kidgell , Warburton , and especially Sandwich . At this time he , too , purposed a retreat to France — a country where his name was already so well known , that when the Honourable Mr Churchill , the son of a general of the name , was asked , in Paris , if he were Churchill , the famous poet , and replied that he was not , the answer of the Frenchman was , “ So much the worse for you . ” His time , however , to visit that coast , destined to be so fatal to him , was not yet quite come .</p>
   <p>From Richmond he removed to Acton-Common , where he had a house furnished with great elegance — “ kept a post-chaise , saddle-horses , and pointers — and fished , fowled , hunted , coursed , and lived in an easy independent manner . ” There he continued his irregular but rapid and energetic course of composition , pouring out poem after poem as if he felt his time to be short , or as if he were spurred on by the secret stings of misery and remorse . To “ The Duellist ” succeeded “ The Author , ” — a poem more general and less poisoned with personalities than any of his former . “ Gotham , ” by far the most poetical of his works , came next . When Lord Sandwich stood for the High-Stewardship of Cambridge , Churchill 's ancient grudge , as well as his itch for satire , revived , and he improvised “ The Candidate , ” a piece of hasty but terrible sarcasm . With breathless and portentous rapidity followed “ The Farewell , ” “ The Times , ” and “ Independence , ” which was his last published production . Two fragments were found among his MSS ., one “ A Dedication to Warburton , ” and another , “ The Journey , ” his latest effort , and in which the last line now seems prophetic —</p>
   <p>“ I on my journey all alone proceed . ”</p>
   <p>A far and final journey was before this great and ill-fated poet . He was seized with one of those sudden longings to see a friend , which are not uncommon with the impulsive . He determined to visit Wilkes at Boulogne , and conveyed his purpose to his brother John in the following note :— “ Dear Jack , adieu , C. C . ” On the 22d of October 1764 , he started for France , met Wilkes ; but on the 29th was seized with miliary fever , under which , while imprudently removed from his bed to be conveyed at his own desire to England , his constitution sunk , and he expired on the 4th of November , in the thirty-third year of his age . He is said to have died calmly and firmly , rebuking the excessive grief of his friends , and repeating some manly but not very Christian lines from his own poetry . By a will made during his sickness , he left an annuity of sixty pounds to his wife ( in addition , we suppose , to her former allowance ) , fifty pounds a-year to Miss Carr , besides providing for his two boys , and leaving mourning rings to his more intimate friends . Wilkes got the charge of all his works . His body was brought to Dover , where he now sleeps in an old churchyard , which once belonged to the church of St Martin , with a stone over him , bearing his age , the date of his death , and this line from one of his own poems —</p>
   <p>“ Life to the last enjoy 'd , here Churchill lies . ”</p>
   <p>The words which he is reported to have used on his deathbed , should have been inscribed on the stone —</p>
   <p>“ What a fool I have been ! ”</p>
   <p>Hogarth had expired on the 25th of October , ten days before his opponent . Lloyd was finishing his dinner , when the news of his friend 's death arrived . He was seized with sudden sickness , and crying out , “ I shall soon follow poor Charles , ” was carried to a bed , whence he was never to rise . Churchill 's favourite sister , Patty , who had been engaged to Lloyd , soon afterwards sank under the double blow . The premature death of this most popular of the poets of the time , excited a great sensation . His furniture and books sold excessively high ; a steel pen , for instance , for five pounds , and a pair of plated spurs for sixteen guineas . Wilkes talked much about his “ dear Churchill , ” but , with the exception of burning a MS. fragmentary satire , which Churchill had begun against Colman and Thornton , two of his intimate friends , and erecting an urn to him near his cottage in the Isle of Wight , with a flaming Latin inscription , he did nothing for his memory . The poet 's brother , John , an apothecary , survived him only one year ; and his two sons , Charles and John , inherited the vices without the genius of their father . There was , as late as 1825 , a grand-daughter of his , a Mary Churchill , who had been a governess , surviving as a patient in St George 's Hospital ,— a characteristic close to such a wayward , unfortunate race .</p>
   <p>For the errors of Churchill , as a man , there does not seem to exist any plea of palliation , except what may be found in the poverty of his early circumstances , and in the strength of his later passions . The worst is , that he never seems to have been seduced into sin through the bewildering and bewitching mists of imagination . It was naked sensuality that he appeared to worship , and he always sinned with his eyes open . Yet his moral sense , though blunted , was never obliterated ; and many traits of generosity and good feeling mingled with his excesses . Choosing satire as the field of his Muse , was partly the cause and partly the effect of an imperfect morale . We are far from averring that no satirist can be a good man , but certainly most satirists have either been very good or very bad men . To the former class have belonged Cowper , Crabbe , &amp; c .; to the latter , such names as Swift , Dryden , Byron , and , we must add , Churchill . Robust manhood , honesty , and hatred of pretence , we admit him to have possessed ; but of genuine love to humanity he seems to have been as destitute as of fear of God , or regard for the ordinary moralities .</p>
   <p>We have to deal with him , however , principally as a poet ; and there can , we think , now be but one opinion as to his peculiar merits . He possessed , beyond all doubt , a strong understanding , a lively imagination , a keen perception of character — especially in its defects and weaknesses — considerable wit without any humour , fierce passions and hatreds , and a boundless command of a loose , careless , but bold and energetic diction ; add to this , a constant tone of self-assertion , and rugged independence . He was emphatically a John Bull , sublimated . He rushed into the poetic arena more like a pugilist than a poet , laying about him on all sides , giving and taking strong blows , and approving himself , in the phrase of “ the fancy , ” game to the backbone . His faults , besides those incident to most satirists ,— such as undue severity , intrusion into private life , anger darkening into malignity , and spleen fermenting into venom ,— were carelessness of style , inequality , and want of condensation . Compared to the satires of Pope , Churchill 's are far less polished , and less pointed . Pope stabs with a silver bodkin — Churchill hews down his opponent with a broadsword . Pope whispers a word in his enemy 's ear which withers the heart within him , and he sinks lifeless to the ground ; Churchill pours out a torrent of blasting invective which at once kills and buries his foe . Dryden was his favourite model ; and although he has written no such condensed masterpieces of satire as the characters of Shaftesbury and Buckingham , yet his works as a whole are not much inferior , and justify the idea that had his life been spared , he might have risen to the level of “ Glorious John . ” His versification , too , is decidedly of the Drydenic type . It is a free , fierce , rushing , sometimes staggering , race across meadow , moor , and mountain , dreading nothing except repose and languor , the lines chasing , and sometimes tumbling over each other in their haste , like impatient hounds at a fox-hunt . But more than Dryden , we think , has Churchill displayed the genuine poetic faculty , as well as often a loftier tone of moral indignation . This latter feeling is the inspiration of “ The Candidate , ” and of “ The Times , ” which , although coarse in subject , and coarse in style , burns with a fire of righteous indignation , reminding you of Juvenal . The finest display of his imaginative power is in “ Gotham , ” which is throughout a glorious rhapsody , resembling some of the best prose effusions of Christopher North , and abounding in such lines as these :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The cedar , whose top mates the highest cloud ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whilst his old father Lebanon grows proud</l>
     <l n="3">Of such a child , and his vast body laid</l>
     <l n="4">Out many a mile , enjoys the filial shade . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is of “ Gotham ” that Cowper says that few writers have equalled it for its “ bold and daring strokes of fancy ; its numbers so hazardously ventured upon , and so happily finished ; its matter so compressed , and yet so clear ; its colouring so sparingly laid on , and yet with such a beautiful effect . ”</p>
   <p>One great objection to Churchill 's poetry lies in the temporary interest of the subjects to which most of it is devoted . The same objection , however , applies to the letters of Junius , and to the speeches and papers of Burke ; and the same answer to it will avail for all . Junius , by the charm of his style , by his classic severities , and purged , poignant venom , contrives to interest us in the paltry political feuds of the past . Burke 's does the same , by the general principles he extracts from , and by the poetry with which he gilds , the rubbish . And so does Churchill , by the weighty sense , the vigorous versification , the inextinguishable spirit , and the trenchant satire and invective of his song . The wretched intrigues of Newcastle and Bute , the squabbles of the aldermen and councillors of the day , the petty quarrels of petty patriots among themselves , and the poverty , spites , and frailties of forgotten players , are all shown as in a magnifying-glass , and shine upon us transfigured in the light of the poet 's genius .</p>
   <p>We have not room for lengthened criticism on all his separate productions . “ The Rosciad ” is the most finished , pointed , and Pope-like of his satires ; it has more memorable and quotable lines than any of the rest . “ The Prophecy of Famine ” is full of trash ; but contains , too , many lines in which political hatred , through its intense fervour , sparkles into poetry : such as —</p>
   <p>“ No birds except as birds of passage flew ; ”</p>
   <p>the account of the creatures which , when admitted into the ark ,</p>
   <p>“ Their saviour shunn 'd , and rankled in the dark ; ”</p>
   <p>and the famous line —</p>
   <p>“ Where half-starved spiders prey on half-starved flies . ”</p>
   <p>“ The Ghost ” is the least felicitous of all his poems , although its picture of Pomposo ( Dr Johnson ) is exceedingly clever . The “ Dedication to Warburton ” is a strain of terrible irony , but fails to damage the Atlantean Bishop . “ The Journey ” is not only interesting as his last production , but contains some affecting personal allusions , intermingled with its stinging scorn — like pale passion-flowers blended with nettles and nightshade . The most of the others have been already characterised .</p>
   <p>Churchill has had two very formidable enemies to his fame and detractors from his genius — Samuel Johnson and Christopher North . The first pronounced him “ a prolific blockhead , ” “ a huge and fertile crab-tree ; ” the second has wielded the knout against his back with peculiar gusto and emphasis , in a paper on satire and satirists , published in Blackwood for 1828 . Had Churchill been alive , he could have easily “ retorted scorn ” — set a “ Christophero ” over against the portrait of “ Pomposo : ” the result had been , as always in such cases , a drawn battle ; and damage would have accrued , not to the special literateurs , but to the general literary character . Prejudice or private pique always lurks at the bottom of such reckless assaults , and all men in the long run feel so . In Johnson 's case , the causa belli was unquestionably political difference ; and in Christopher North 's it was the love of Scotland which so warmly glowed in his bosom , and which created a glow of hatred no less warm against Scotland 's ablest , fiercest , and most inveterate poetical foe .</p>
   <p>Churchill 's poetry only requires to be better known to be highly appreciated for its masculine and thoroughly English qualities . In taking our leave of him , we are again haunted by the signal resemblance he bears , both in mental characteristics and in history , to Byron . Both were powerful in satire , and still more so in purely poetic composition . Both were irregular in life , and unfortunate in marriage . Both were distinguished by fitful generosity , and careless tenderness . Both obtained at once , and during all their career maintained , a pre-eminence in popularity over all their contemporaries . Both were severely handled by reviewers , and underrated by rivals . Both assumed an attitude of defiance to the world , and stood ostentatiously at bay . Both mingled largely in the politics of their day , and both took the liberal side . Both felt and expressed keen remorse for their errors , and purposed and in part began reformation . Both died at an untimely age by fever , and in a foreign land . The dust of both , not admitted into Westminster Abbey , nevertheless reposes in their native soil , and attracts daily visitors , who lean , and weep , and wonder over it — partly in sympathy with their fate — partly in pity for their errors — and partly in admiration of their genius .</p>
   <p>NOTE .— We have not alluded to various anecdotes told about Churchill 's journey to Wales , about his setting up as a cider merchant , &amp; c ., because some of them appear extremely apocryphal . The author of an article on him in the Edinburgh Review for January 1845 asserts that he was rejected from Oxford because he had already been married . But , if so , why was he admitted to Cambridge ? Besides , the writer adduces no proof of his assertion . The paper , otherwise , is worthy of its author and of the poet .</p>

     <l n="227">Happy in tragic and in comic powers ,</l>
     <l n="228">Have we not Shakspeare ?— Is not Jonson ours ?</l>
     <l n="229">For them , your natural judges , Britons , vote ;</l>
     <l n="230">They 'll judge like Britons , who like Britons wrote .</l>
     <l n="231">He said , and conquer 'd — Sense resumed her sway ,</l>
     <l n="232">And disappointed pedants stalk 'd away .</l>
     <l n="233">Shakspeare and Jonson , with deserved applause ,</l>
     <l n="234">Joint-judges were ordain 'd to try the cause . 230</l>
     <l n="235">Meantime the stranger every voice employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="236">To ask or tell his name . Who is it ? Lloyd .</l>
     <l n="237">Thus , when the aged friends of Job stood mute ,</l>
     <l n="238">And , tamely prudent , gave up the dispute ,</l>
     <l n="239">Elihu , with the decent warmth of youth ,</l>
     <l n="240">Boldly stood forth the advocate of Truth ;</l>
     <l n="241">Confuted Falsehood , and disabled Pride ,</l>
     <l n="242">Whilst baffled Age stood snarling at his side .</l>
     <l n="243">The day of trial 's fix 'd , nor any fear</l>
     <l n="244">Lest day of trial should be put off here . 240</l>
     <l n="245">Causes but seldom for delay can call</l>
     <l n="246">In courts where forms are few , fees none at all .</l>
     <l n="247">The morning came , nor find I that the Sun ,</l>
     <l n="248">As he on other great events hath done ,</l>
     <l n="249">Put on a brighter robe than what he wore</l>
     <l n="250">To go his journey in , the day before .</l>
     <l n="251">Full in the centre of a spacious plain ,</l>
     <l n="252">On plan entirely new , where nothing vain ,</l>
     <l n="253">Nothing magnificent appear 'd , but Art</l>
     <l n="254">With decent modesty perform 'd her part , 250</l>
     <l n="255">Rose a tribunal : from no other court</l>
     <l n="256">It borrow 'd ornament , or sought support :</l>
     <l n="257">No juries here were pack 'd to kill or clear ,</l>
     <l n="258">No bribes were taken , nor oaths broken here ;</l>
     <l n="259">No gownsmen , partial to a client 's cause ,</l>
     <l n="260">To their own purpose turn 'd the pliant laws ;</l>
     <l n="261">Each judge was true and steady to his trust ,</l>
     <l n="262">As Mansfield wise , and as old Foster<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>just .</l>
     <l n="263">In the first seat , in robe of various dyes ,</l>
     <l n="264">A noble wildness flashing from his eyes , 260</l>
     <l n="265">Sat Shakspeare : in one hand a wand he bore ,</l>
     <l n="266">For mighty wonders famed in days of yore ;</l>
     <l n="267">The other held a globe , which to his will</l>
     <l n="268">Obedient turn 'd , and own 'd the master 's skill :</l>
     <l n="269">Things of the noblest kind his genius drew ,</l>
     <l n="270">And look 'd through Nature at a single view :</l>
     <l n="271">A loose he gave to his unbounded soul ,</l>
     <l n="272">And taught new lands to rise , new seas to roll ;</l>
     <l n="273">Call 'd into being scenes unknown before ,</l>
     <l n="274">And passing Nature 's bounds , was something more . 270</l>
     <l n="275">Next Jonson sat , in ancient learning train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="276">His rigid judgment Fancy 's flights restrain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="277">Correctly pruned each wild luxuriant thought ,</l>
     <l n="278">Mark 'd out her course , nor spared a glorious fault .</l>
     <l n="279">The book of man he read with nicest art ,</l>
     <l n="280">And ransack 'd all the secrets of the heart ;</l>
     <l n="281">Exerted penetration 's utmost force ,</l>
     <l n="282">And traced each passion to its proper source ;</l>
     <l n="283">Then , strongly mark 'd , in liveliest colours drew ,</l>
     <l n="284">And brought each foible forth to public view : 280</l>
     <l n="285">The coxcomb felt a lash in every word ,</l>
     <l n="286">And fools , hung out , their brother fools deterr 'd .</l>
     <l n="287">His comic humour kept the world in awe ,</l>
     <l n="288">And Laughter frighten 'd Folly more than Law .</l>
     <l n="289">But , hark ! the trumpet sounds , the crowd gives way ,</l>
     <l n="290">And the procession comes in just array .</l>
     <l n="291">Now should I , in some sweet poetic line ,</l>
     <l n="292">Offer up incense at Apollo 's shrine ,</l>
     <l n="293">Invoke the Muse to quit her calm abode ,</l>
     <l n="294">And waken Memory with a sleeping Ode .<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>290</l>
     <l n="295">For how shall mortal man , in mortal verse ,</l>
     <l n="296">Their titles , merits , or their names rehearse ?</l>
     <l n="297">But give , kind Dulness ! memory and rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="298">We ‘ ll put off Genius till another time .</l>
     <l n="299">First , Order came ,— with solemn step , and slow ,</l>
     <l n="300">In measured time his feet were taught to go .</l>
     <l n="301">Behind , from time to time , he cast his eye ,</l>
     <l n="302">Lest this should quit his place , that step awry .</l>
     <l n="303">Appearances to save his only care ;</l>
     <l n="304">So things seem right , no matter what they are . 300</l>
     <l n="305">In him his parents saw themselves renew 'd ,</l>
     <l n="306">Begotten by Sir Critic on Saint Prude .</l>
     <l n="307">Then came drum , trumpet , hautboy , fiddle , flute ;</l>
     <l n="308">Next snuffer , sweeper , shifter , soldier , mute :</l>
     <l n="309">Legions of angels all in white advance ;</l>
     <l n="310">Furies , all fire , come forward in a dance ;</l>
     <l n="311">Pantomime figures then are brought to view ,</l>
     <l n="312">Fools , hand in hand with fools , go two by two .</l>
     <l n="313">Next came the treasurer of either house ;</l>
     <l n="314">One with full purse , t'other with not a sous . 310</l>
     <l n="315">Behind , a group of figures awe create ,</l>
     <l n="316">Set off with all the impertinence of state ;</l>
     <l n="317">By lace and feather consecrate to fame ,</l>
     <l n="318">Expletive kings , and queens without a name .</l>
     <l n="319">Here Havard ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>all serene , in the same strains ,</l>
     <l n="320">Loves , hates , and rages , triumphs and complains ;</l>
     <l n="321">His easy vacant face proclaim 'd a heart</l>
     <l n="322">Which could not feel emotions , nor impart .</l>
     <l n="323">With him came mighty Davies :[ 24 ] on my life ,</l>
     <l n="324">That Davies hath a very pretty wife ! 320</l>
     <l n="325">Statesman all over , in plots famous grown ,</l>
     <l n="326">He mouths a sentence , as curs mouth a bone .</l>
     <l n="327">Next Holland<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>came : with truly tragic stalk ,</l>
     <l n="328">He creeps , he flies ,— a hero should not walk .</l>
     <l n="329">As if with Heaven he warr 'd , his eager eyes</l>
     <l n="330">Planted their batteries against the skies ;</l>
     <l n="331">Attitude , action , air , pause , start , sigh , groan ,</l>
     <l n="332">He borrow 'd , and made use of as his own .</l>
     <l n="333">By fortune thrown on any other stage ,</l>
     <l n="334">He might , perhaps , have pleased an easy age ; 330</l>
     <l n="335">But now appears a copy , and no more ,</l>
     <l n="336">Of something better we have seen before .</l>
     <l n="337">The actor who would build a solid fame ,</l>
     <l n="338">Must Imitation 's servile arts disclaim ;</l>
     <l n="339">Act from himself , on his own bottom stand ;</l>
     <l n="340">I hate e'en Garrick thus at second-hand .</l>
     <l n="341">Behind came King .<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>— Bred up in modest lore ,</l>
     <l n="342">Bashful and young , he sought Hibernia 's shore ;</l>
     <l n="343">Hibernia , famed , ‘ bove every other grace ,</l>
     <l n="344">For matchless intrepidity of face . 340</l>
     <l n="345">From her his features caught the generous flame ,</l>
     <l n="346">And bid defiance to all sense of shame .</l>
     <l n="347">Tutor 'd by her all rivals to surpass ,</l>
     <l n="348">‘ Mongst Drury 's sons he comes , and shines in Brass .</l>
     <l n="349">Lo , Yates<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>! Without the least finesse of art</l>
     <l n="350">He gets applause — I wish he 'd get his part .</l>
     <l n="351">When hot Impatience is in full career ,</l>
     <l n="352">How vilely ‘ Hark ye ! hark ye ! ’ grates the ear ;</l>
     <l n="353">When active fancy from the brain is sent ,</l>
     <l n="354">And stands on tip-toe for some wish 'd event , 350</l>
     <l n="355">I hate those careless blunders , which recall</l>
     <l n="356">Suspended sense , and prove it fiction all .</l>
     <l n="357">In characters of low and vulgar mould ,</l>
     <l n="358">Where Nature 's coarsest features we behold ;</l>
     <l n="359">Where , destitute of every decent grace ,</l>
     <l n="360">Unmanner 'd jests are blurted in your face ,</l>
     <l n="361">There Yates with justice strict attention draws ,</l>
     <l n="362">Acts truly from himself , and gains applause .</l>
     <l n="363">But when , to please himself or charm his wife ,</l>
     <l n="364">He aims at something in politer life , 360</l>
     <l n="365">When , blindly thwarting Nature 's stubborn plan ,</l>
     <l n="366">He treads the stage by way of gentleman ,</l>
     <l n="367">The clown , who no one touch of breeding knows ,</l>
     <l n="368">Looks like Tom Errand<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span>dress 'd in Clincher 's clothes .</l>
     <l n="369">Fond of his dress , fond of his person grown ,</l>
     <l n="370">Laugh 'd at by all , and to himself unknown ,</l>
     <l n="371">Prom side to side he struts , he smiles , he prates ,</l>
     <l n="372">And seems to wonder what 's become of Yates .</l>
     <l n="373">Woodward<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>, endow 'd with various tricks of face ,</l>
     <l n="374">Great master in the science of grimace , 370</l>
     <l n="375">From Ireland ventures , favourite of the town ,</l>
     <l n="376">Lured by the pleasing prospect of renown ;</l>
     <l n="377">A speaking harlequin , made up of whim ,</l>
     <l n="378">He twists , he twines , he tortures every limb ;</l>
     <l n="379">Plays to the eye with a mere monkey 's art ,</l>
     <l n="380">And leaves to sense the conquest of the heart .</l>
     <l n="381">We laugh indeed , but , on reflection 's birth ,</l>
     <l n="382">We wonder at ourselves , and curse our mirth .</l>
     <l n="383">His walk of parts he fatally misplaced ,</l>
     <l n="384">And inclination fondly took for taste ; 380</l>
     <l n="385">Hence hath the town so often seen display 'd</l>
     <l n="386">Beau in burlesque , high life in masquerade .</l>
     <l n="387">But when bold wits ,— not such as patch up plays ,</l>
     <l n="388">Cold and correct , in these insipid days ,—</l>
     <l n="389">Some comic character , strong featured , urge</l>
     <l n="390">To probability 's extremest verge ;</l>
     <l n="391">Where modest Judgment her decree suspends ,</l>
     <l n="392">And , for a time , nor censures , nor commends ;</l>
     <l n="393">Where critics can n't determine on the spot</l>
     <l n="394">Whether it is in nature found or not , 390</l>
     <l n="395">There Woodward safely shall his powers exert ,</l>
     <l n="396">Nor fail of favour where he shows desert ;</l>
     <l n="397">Hence he in Bobadil such praises bore ,</l>
     <l n="398">Such worthy praises , Kitely<span type="note_anchor">[ 30 ]</span>scarce had more .</l>
     <l n="399">By turns transform 'd into all kind of shapes ,</l>
     <l n="400">Constant to none , Foote laughs , cries , struts , and scrapes :</l>
     <l n="401">Now in the centre , now in van or rear ,</l>
     <l n="402">The Proteus shifts , bawd , parson , auctioneer .</l>
     <l n="403">His strokes of humour , and his bursts of sport ,</l>
     <l n="404">Are all contain 'd in this one word — distort . 400</l>
     <l n="405">Doth a man stutter , look a-squint , or halt ?</l>
     <l n="406">Mimics draw humour out of Nature 's fault ,</l>
     <l n="407">With personal defects their mirth adorn ,</l>
     <l n="408">And bang misfortunes out to public scorn .</l>
     <l n="409">E'en I , whom Nature cast in hideous mould ,</l>
     <l n="410">Whom , having made , she trembled to behold ,</l>
     <l n="411">Beneath the load of mimicry may groan ,</l>
     <l n="412">And find that Nature 's errors are my own .</l>
     <l n="413">Shadows behind of Foote and Woodward came ;</l>
     <l n="414">Wilkinson this , Obrien<span type="note_anchor">[ 31 ]</span>was that name . 410</l>
     <l n="415">Strange to relate , but wonderfully true ,</l>
     <l n="416">That even shadows have their shadows too !</l>
     <l n="417">With not a single comic power endued ,</l>
     <l n="418">The first a mere , mere mimic 's mimic stood ;</l>
     <l n="419">The last , by Nature form 'd to please , who shows ,</l>
     <l n="420">In Johnson 's Stephen , which way genius grows ,</l>
     <l n="421">Self quite put off , affects with too much art</l>
     <l n="422">To put on Woodward in each mangled part ;</l>
     <l n="423">Adopts his shrug , his wink , his stare ; nay , more ,</l>
     <l n="424">His voice , and croaks ; for Woodward croak 'd before . 420</l>
     <l n="425">When a dull copier simple grace neglects ,</l>
     <l n="426">And rests his imitation in defects ,</l>
     <l n="427">We readily forgive ; but such vile arts</l>
     <l n="428">Are double guilt in men of real parts .</l>
     <l n="429">By Nature form 'd in her perversest mood ,</l>
     <l n="430">With no one requisite of art endued ,</l>
     <l n="431">Next Jackson came<span type="note_anchor">[ 32 ]</span>— Observe that settled glare ,</l>
     <l n="432">Which better speaks a puppet than a player ;</l>
     <l n="433">List to that voice — did ever Discord hear</l>

     <l n="435">When to enforce some very tender part ,</l>
     <l n="436">The right hand slips by instinct on the heart ,</l>
     <l n="437">His soul , of every other thought bereft ,</l>
     <l n="438">Is anxious only where to place the left ;</l>

     <l n="440">To soothe his weeping mother , turns and bows :</l>
     <l n="441">Awkward , embarrass 'd , stiff , without the skill</l>
     <l n="442">Of moving gracefully , or standing still ,</l>
     <l n="443">One leg , as if suspicious of his brother ,</l>
     <l n="444">Desirous seems to run away from t'other . 440</l>
     <l n="445">Some errors , handed down from age to age ,</l>
     <l n="446">Plead custom 's force , and still possess the stage .</l>
     <l n="447">That 's vile : should we a parent 's faults adore ,</l>

     <l n="449">If , inattentive to the author 's mind ,</l>
     <l n="450">Some actors made the jest they could not find ;</l>

     <l n="458">It was the fashion twenty years ago .</l>

     <l n="461">To copy beauties , forfeits all pretence</l>
     <l n="462">To fame — to copy faults , is want of sense .</l>

     <l n="970">Too proud for tenderness , too dull for rage .</l>
     <l n="971">When Hector 's lovely widow shines in tears ,</l>
     <l n="972">Or Rowe 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>gay rake dependent virtue jeers ,</l>

     <l n="974">To chide the libertine , and court the queen . 970</l>
     <l n="975">From the tame scene , which without passion flows ,</l>
     <l n="976">With just desert his reputation rose ;</l>

     <l n="991">Next follows Sheridan .<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>A doubtful name ,</l>
     <l n="992">As yet unsettled in the rank of fame :</l>
     <l n="993">This , fondly lavish in his praises grown ,</l>
     <l n="994">Gives him all merit ; that allows him none ; 990</l>
     <l n="995">Between them both , we 'll steer the middle course ,</l>
     <l n="996">Nor , loving praise , rob Judgment of her force .</l>
     <l n="997">Just his conceptions , natural and great ,</l>

     <l n="999">Was speech-famed Quin himself to hear him speak ,</l>
     <l n="1000">Envy would drive the colour from his cheek ;</l>

     <l n="1003">Fix 'd in one frame of features , glare of eye ,</l>
     <l n="1004">Passions , like chaos , in confusion lie ; 1000</l>
     <l n="1005">In vain the wonders of his skill are tried</l>
     <l n="1006">To form distinctions Nature hath denied .</l>
     <l n="1007">His voice no touch of harmony admits ,</l>
     <l n="1008">Irregularly deep , and shrill by fits .</l>
     <l n="1009">The two extremes appear like man and wife ,</l>
     <l n="1010">Coupled together for the sake of strife .</l>
     <l n="1011">His action 's always strong , but sometimes such ,</l>
     <l n="1012">That candour must declare he acts too much .</l>
     <l n="1013">Why must impatience fall three paces back ?</l>
     <l n="1014">Why paces three return to the attack ? 1010</l>
     <l n="1015">Why is the right leg , too , forbid to stir ,</l>
     <l n="1016">Unless in motion semicircular ?</l>
     <l n="1017">Why must the hero with the Nailor<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>vie ,</l>

     <l n="1019">In Royal John , with Philip angry grown ,</l>

     <l n="1023">But , spite of all defects , his glories rise ,</l>
     <l n="1024">And art , by judgment form 'd , with nature vies . 1020</l>
     <l n="1025">Behold him sound the depth of Hubert 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>soul ,</l>

     <l n="1029">Where he falls short , ‘ tis Nature 's fault alone ;</l>

     <l n="1037">Another can n't forgive the paltry arts</l>
     <l n="1038">By which he makes his way to shallow hearts ;</l>

     <l n="1040">‘ Avaunt ! unnatural start , affected pause ! ’</l>
     <l n="1041">For me , by Nature form 'd to judge with phlegm ,</l>
     <l n="1042">I can n't acquit by wholesale , nor condemn .</l>
     <l n="1043">The best things carried to excess are wrong ;</l>
     <l n="1044">The start may be too frequent , pause too long : 1040</l>
     <l n="1045">But , only used in proper time and place ,</l>
     <l n="1046">Severest judgment must allow them grace .</l>
     <l n="1047">If bunglers , form 'd on Imitation 's plan ,</l>
     <l n="1048">Just in the way that monkeys mimic man ,</l>
     <l n="1049">Their copied scene with mangled arts disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="1050">And pause and start with the same vacant face ,</l>
     <l n="1051">We join the critic laugh ; those tricks we scorn</l>
     <l n="1052">Which spoil the scenes they mean them to adorn .</l>
     <l n="1053">But when , from Nature 's pure and genuine source ,</l>
     <l n="1054">These strokes of acting flow with generous force , 1050</l>
     <l n="1055">When in the features all the soul 's portray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1056">And passions , such as Garrick 's , are display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1057">To me they seem from quickest feelings caught —</l>
     <l n="1058">Each start is nature , and each pause is thought .</l>
     <l n="1059">When reason yields to passion 's wild alarms ,</l>
     <l n="1060">And the whole state of man is up in arms ,</l>
     <l n="1061">What but a critic could condemn the player</l>
     <l n="1062">For pausing here , when cool sense pauses there ?</l>
     <l n="1063">Whilst , working from the heart , the fire I trace ,</l>
     <l n="1064">And mark it strongly flaming to the face ; 1060</l>
     <l n="1065">Whilst in each sound I hear the very man ,</l>
     <l n="1066">I can n't catch words , and pity those who can .</l>

     <l n="1086">If thorough knowledge of the human heart ;</l>

     <l n="1088">If fewest faults with greatest beauties join 'd ;</l>

     <l n="1093">Deserve the preference — Garrick ! take the chair ;</l>
     <l n="1094">Nor quit it — till thou place an equal there . 1090</l>

     <l n="5">Vast as a weaver 's beam the javelin wield ;</l>
     <l n="6">With the loud voice of thundering Jove defy ,</l>

     <l n="13">And hold , Astraea-like , the scales of wit ,</l>
     <l n="14">With partial rage rush forth — oh ! shame to tell !—</l>
     <l n="15">To crush a bard just bursting from the shell ?</l>
     <l n="16">Great are his perils in this stormy time</l>
     <l n="17">Who rashly ventures on a sea of rhyme :</l>
     <l n="18">Around vast surges roll , winds envious blow ,</l>
     <l n="19">And jealous rocks and quicksands lurk below :</l>
     <l n="20">Greatly his foes he dreads , but more his friends ;</l>

     <l n="42">Legions of factious authors throng at once ,</l>

     <l n="47">The polish 'd falsehood 's into public brought .</l>
     <l n="48">Quick-circulating slanders mirth afford ;</l>

     <l n="54">No servile rules drew sickly taste aside ;</l>
     <l n="55">Secure he walk 'd , for Nature was his guide .</l>
     <l n="56">But now — oh ! strange reverse !— our critics bawl</l>
     <l n="57">In praise of candour with a heart of gall ;</l>
     <l n="58">Conscious of guilt , and fearful of the light ,</l>
     <l n="59">They lurk enshrouded in the vale of night ;</l>

     <l n="354">To him who ever held the Muses dear —</l>
     <l n="355">If e'er her labours weaken to refine</l>
     <l n="356">The generous roughness of a nervous line .</l>
     <l n="357">Others affect the stiff and swelling phrase ;</l>
     <l n="358">Their Muse must walk in stilts , and strut in stays ;</l>
     <l n="359">The sense they murder , and the words transpose ,</l>
     <l n="360">Lest poetry approach too near to prose .</l>
     <l n="361">See tortured Reason how they pare and trim , 360</l>
     <l n="362">And , like Procrustes , stretch , or lop the limb .</l>
     <l n="363">Waller ! whose praise succeeding bards rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="364">Parent of harmony in English verse ,</l>
     <l n="365">Whose tuneful Muse in sweetest accents flows ,</l>
     <l n="366">In couplets first taught straggling sense to close .</l>
     <l n="367">In polish 'd numbers and majestic sound ,</l>
     <l n="368">Where shall thy rival , Pope ! be ever found ?</l>
     <l n="369">But whilst each line with equal beauty flows .</l>
     <l n="370">E'en excellence , unvaried , tedious grows .</l>
     <l n="371">Nature , through all her works , in great degree , 370</l>
     <l n="372">Borrows a blessing from variety .</l>
     <l n="373">Music itself her needful aid requires</l>
     <l n="374">To rouse the soul , and wake our dying fires .</l>
     <l n="375">Still in one key , the nightingale would tease ;</l>
     <l n="376">Still in one key , not Brent would always please .</l>
     <l n="377">Here let me bend , great Dryden ! at thy shrine ,</l>
     <l n="378">Thou dearest name to all the Tuneful Nine !</l>
     <l n="379">What if some dull lines in cold order creep ,</l>
     <l n="380">And with his theme the poet seems to sleep ?</l>
     <l n="381">Still , when his subject rises proud to view , 380</l>
     <l n="382">With equal strength the poet rises too :</l>
     <l n="383">With strong invention , noblest vigour fraught ,</l>
     <l n="384">Thought still springs up and rises out of thought ;</l>
     <l n="385">Numbers ennobling numbers in their course ,</l>
     <l n="386">In varied sweetness flow , in varied force ;</l>
     <l n="387">The powers of genius and of judgment join ,</l>
     <l n="388">And the whole Art of Poetry is thine .</l>
     <l n="389">But what are numbers , what are bards to me ,</l>
     <l n="390">Forbid to tread the paths of poesy ?</l>
     <l n="391">A sacred Muse should consecrate her pen — 390</l>
     <l n="392">Priests must not hear nor see like other men —</l>
     <l n="393">Far higher themes should her ambition claim :</l>
     <l n="394">Behold where Sternhold points the way to fame !</l>
     <l n="395">Whilst with mistaken zeal dull bigots burn ,</l>
     <l n="396">Let Reason for a moment take her turn .</l>
     <l n="397">When coffee-sages hold discourse with kings ,</l>
     <l n="398">And blindly walk in paper leading-strings ,</l>
     <l n="399">What if a man delight to pass his time</l>
     <l n="400">In spinning reason into harmless rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="401">Or sometimes boldly venture to the play ? 400</l>
     <l n="402">Say , where 's the crime , great man of prudence , say ?</l>
     <l n="403">No two on earth in all things can agree ;</l>
     <l n="404">All have some darling singularity :</l>
     <l n="405">Women and men , as well as girls and boys ,</l>
     <l n="406">In gew-gaws take delight , and sigh for toys .</l>
     <l n="407">Your sceptres and your crowns , and such like things ,</l>
     <l n="408">Are but a better kind of toys for kings .</l>
     <l n="409">In things indifferent Reason bids us choose ,</l>
     <l n="410">Whether the whim 's a monkey or a Muse .</l>
     <l n="411">What the grave triflers on this busy scene , 410</l>
     <l n="412">When they make use of this word Reason , mean ,</l>
     <l n="413">I know not ; but according to my plan ,</l>
     <l n="414">‘ Tis Lord Chief-Justice in the court of man ;</l>
     <l n="415">Equally form 'd to rule in age or youth ,</l>
     <l n="416">The friend of virtue and the guide to truth ;</l>
     <l n="417">To her I bow , whose sacred power I feel ;</l>
     <l n="418">To her decision make my last appeal ;</l>
     <l n="419">Condemn 'd by her , applauding worlds in vain</l>
     <l n="420">Should tempt me to take up the pen again ;</l>
     <l n="421">By her absolved , my course I 'll still pursue : 420</l>
     <l n="422">If Reason 's for me , God is for me too .</l>

     <l n="2">When foes insult , and prudent friends dispense ,</l>
     <l n="3">In pity 's strains , the worst of insolence ,</l>
     <l n="4">Oft with thee , Lloyd , I steal an hour from grief ,</l>
     <l n="5">And in thy social converse find relief .</l>
     <l n="6">The mind , of solitude impatient grown ,</l>
     <l n="7">Loves any sorrows rather than her own .</l>
     <l n="8">Let slaves to business , bodies without soul ,</l>
     <l n="9">Important blanks in Nature 's mighty roll ,</l>
     <l n="10">Solemnise nonsense in the day 's broad glare ,</l>
     <l n="11">We Night prefer , which heals or hides our care . 10</l>
     <l n="12">Rogues justified , and by success made bold ,</l>
     <l n="13">Dull fools and coxcombs sanctified by gold ,</l>
     <l n="14">Freely may bask in fortune 's partial ray ,</l>
     <l n="15">And spread their feathers opening to the day ;</l>
     <l n="16">But threadbare Merit dares not show the head</l>
     <l n="17">Till vain Prosperity retires to bed .</l>
     <l n="18">Misfortunes , like the owl , avoid the light ;</l>
     <l n="19">The sons of Care are always sons of Night .</l>
     <l n="20">The wretch , bred up in Method 's drowsy school ,</l>
     <l n="21">Whose only merit is to err by rule , 20</l>
     <l n="22">Who ne'er through heat of blood was tripping caught ,</l>
     <l n="23">Nor guilty deem 'd of one eccentric thought ;</l>
     <l n="24">Whose soul directed to no use is seen ,</l>
     <l n="25">Unless to move the body 's dull machine ,</l>
     <l n="26">Which , clock-work like , with the same equal pace</l>
     <l n="27">Still travels on through life 's insipid space ,</l>
     <l n="28">Turns up his eyes to think that there should be ,</l>
     <l n="29">Among God 's creatures , two such things as we ;</l>
     <l n="30">Then for his nightcap calls , and thanks the powers</l>
     <l n="31">Which kindly gave him grace to keep good hours . 30</l>
     <l n="32">Good hours !— fine words — but was it ever seen</l>
     <l n="33">That all men could agree in what they mean ?</l>
     <l n="34">Florio , who many years a course hath run</l>
     <l n="35">In downright opposition to the sun ,</l>
     <l n="36">Expatiates on good hours , their cause defends</l>
     <l n="37">With as much vigour as our prudent friends .</l>
     <l n="38">The uncertain term no settled notion brings ,</l>
     <l n="39">But still in different mouths means different things ;</l>
     <l n="40">Each takes the phrase in his own private view ;</l>
     <l n="41">With Prudence it is ten , with Florio two . 40</l>
     <l n="42">Go on , ye fools ! who talk for talking sake ,</l>
     <l n="43">Without distinguishing , distinctions make ;</l>
     <l n="44">Shine forth in native folly , native pride ,</l>
     <l n="45">Make yourselves rules to all the world beside ;</l>
     <l n="46">Reason , collected in herself , disdains</l>
     <l n="47">The slavish yoke of arbitrary chains ;</l>
     <l n="48">Steady and true , each circumstance she weighs ,</l>
     <l n="49">Nor to bare words inglorious tribute pays .</l>
     <l n="50">Men of sense live exempt from vulgar awe ,</l>
     <l n="51">And Reason to herself alone is law : 50</l>
     <l n="52">That freedom she enjoys with liberal mind ,</l>
     <l n="53">Which she as freely grants to all mankind .</l>
     <l n="54">No idol-titled name her reverence stirs ,</l>
     <l n="55">No hour she blindly to the rest prefers ;</l>
     <l n="56">All are alike , if they 're alike employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="57">And all are good if virtuously enjoy 'd .</l>
     <l n="58">Let the sage Doctor ( think him one we know )</l>
     <l n="59">With scraps of ancient learning overflow ,</l>
     <l n="60">In all the dignity of wig declare</l>
     <l n="61">The fatal consequence of midnight air , 60</l>
     <l n="62">How damps and vapours , as it were by stealth ,</l>
     <l n="63">Undermine life , and sap the walls of health :</l>
     <l n="64">For me let Galen moulder on the shelf ,</l>
     <l n="65">I 'll live , and be physician to myself .</l>
     <l n="66">Whilst soul is join 'd to body , whether fate</l>
     <l n="67">Allot a longer or a shorter date ,</l>
     <l n="68">I 'll make them live , as brother should with brother ,</l>
     <l n="69">And keep them in good humour with each other .</l>
     <l n="70">The surest road to health , say what they will ,</l>
     <l n="71">Is never to suppose we shall be ill. 70</l>
     <l n="72">Most of those evils we poor mortals know ,</l>
     <l n="73">From doctors and imagination flow .</l>
     <l n="74">Hence to old women with your boasted rules ,</l>
     <l n="75">Stale traps , and only sacred now to fools ;</l>
     <l n="76">As well may sons of physic hope to find</l>
     <l n="77">One medicine , as one hour , for all mankind !</l>
     <l n="78">If Rupert after ten is out of bed ,</l>
     <l n="79">The fool next morning can n't hold up his head ;</l>
     <l n="80">What reason this which me to bed must call ,</l>
     <l n="81">Whose head , thank Heaven , never aches at all ? 80</l>
     <l n="82">In different courses different tempers run ;</l>
     <l n="83">He hates the moon , I sicken at the sun .</l>
     <l n="84">Wound up at twelve at noon , his clock goes right ;</l>
     <l n="85">Mine better goes , wound up at twelve at night .</l>
     <l n="86">Then in oblivion 's grateful cup I drown</l>
     <l n="87">The galling sneer , the supercilious frown ,</l>
     <l n="88">The strange reserve , the proud , affected state</l>
     <l n="89">Of upstart knaves grown rich , and fools grown great .</l>
     <l n="90">No more that abject wretch<span type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>disturbs my rest ,</l>
     <l n="91">Who meanly overlooks a friend distress 'd . 90</l>
     <l n="92">Purblind to poverty , the worldling goes ,</l>
     <l n="93">And scarce sees rags an inch beyond his nose ;</l>
     <l n="94">But from a crowd can single out his Grace ,</l>
     <l n="95">And cringe and creep to fools who strut in lace .</l>
     <l n="96">Whether those classic regions are survey 'd</l>
     <l n="97">Where we in earliest youth together stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="98">Where hand in hand we trod the flowery shore ,</l>
     <l n="99">Though now thy happier genius runs before ;</l>
     <l n="100">When we conspired a thankless wretch<span type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>to raise ,</l>
     <l n="101">And taught a stump to shoot with pilfer 'd praise , 100</l>
     <l n="102">Who once , for reverend merit famous grown ,</l>
     <l n="103">Gratefully strove to kick his maker down ;</l>
     <l n="104">Or if more general arguments engage ,—</l>
     <l n="105">The court or camp , the pulpit , bar , or stage ;</l>
     <l n="106">If half-bred surgeons , whom men doctors call ,</l>
     <l n="107">And lawyers , who were never bred at all ,</l>
     <l n="108">Those mighty letter 'd monsters of the earth ,</l>
     <l n="109">Our pity move , or exercise our mirth ;</l>
     <l n="110">Or if in tittle-tattle , toothpick way ,</l>
     <l n="111">Our rambling thoughts with easy freedom stray ,— 110</l>
     <l n="112">A gainer still thy friend himself must find ,</l>
     <l n="113">His grief suspended , and improved his mind .</l>
     <l n="114">Whilst peaceful slumbers bless the homely bed</l>
     <l n="115">Where virtue , self-approved , reclines her head ;</l>
     <l n="116">Whilst vice beneath imagined horrors mourns ,</l>
     <l n="117">And conscience plants the villain 's couch with thorns ;</l>
     <l n="118">Impatient of restraint , the active mind ,</l>
     <l n="119">No more by servile prejudice confined ,</l>
     <l n="120">Leaps from her seat , as waken 'd from a trance</l>
     <l n="121">And darts through Nature at a single glance 120</l>
     <l n="122">Then we our friends , our foes , ourselves , survey ,</l>
     <l n="123">And see by Night what fools we are by day .</l>
     <l n="124">Stripp 'd of her gaudy plumes , and vain disguise ,</l>
     <l n="125">See where ambition , mean and loathsome , lies ;</l>
     <l n="126">Reflection with relentless hand pulls down</l>
     <l n="127">The tyrant 's bloody wreath and ravish 'd crown .</l>
     <l n="128">In vain he tells of battles bravely won ,</l>
     <l n="129">Of nations conquer 'd , and of worlds undone ;</l>
     <l n="130">Triumphs like these but ill with manhood suit ,</l>
     <l n="131">And sink the conqueror beneath the brute . 130</l>
     <l n="132">But if , in searching round the world , we find</l>
     <l n="133">Some generous youth , the friend of all mankind ,</l>
     <l n="134">Whose anger , like the bolt of Jove , is sped</l>
     <l n="135">In terrors only at the guilty head ,</l>
     <l n="136">Whose mercies , like heaven 's dew , refreshing fall</l>
     <l n="137">In general love and charity to all ,</l>
     <l n="138">Pleased we behold such worth on any throne ,</l>
     <l n="139">And doubly pleased we find it on our own .</l>
     <l n="140">Through a false medium things are shown by day ;</l>
     <l n="141">Pomp , wealth , and titles , judgment lead astray . 140</l>
     <l n="142">How many from appearance borrow state ,</l>
     <l n="143">Whom Night disdains to number with the great !</l>
     <l n="144">Must not we laugh to see yon lordling proud</l>
     <l n="145">Snuff up vile incense from a fawning crowd ?</l>
     <l n="146">Whilst in his beam surrounding clients play ,</l>
     <l n="147">Like insects in the sun 's enlivening ray ,</l>
     <l n="148">Whilst , Jehu-like , he drives at furious rate ,</l>
     <l n="149">And seems the only charioteer of state ,</l>
     <l n="150">Talking himself into a little god ,</l>
     <l n="151">And ruling empires with a single nod ; 150</l>
     <l n="152">Who would not think , to hear him law dispense ,</l>
     <l n="153">That he had interest , and that they had sense ?</l>
     <l n="154">Injurious thought ! beneath Night 's honest shade ,</l>
     <l n="155">When pomp is buried , and false colours fade ,</l>
     <l n="156">Plainly we see at that impartial hour ,</l>
     <l n="157">Them dupes to pride , and him the tool of power .</l>
     <l n="158">God help the man , condemn 'd by cruel fate</l>
     <l n="159">To court the seeming , or the real great !</l>
     <l n="160">Much sorrow shall he feel , and suffer more</l>
     <l n="161">Than any slave who labours at the oar ! 160</l>
     <l n="162">By slavish methods must he learn to please ,</l>
     <l n="163">By smooth-tongued flattery , that cursed court-disease ;</l>
     <l n="164">Supple , to every wayward mood strike sail ,</l>
     <l n="165">And shift with shifting humour 's peevish gale .</l>
     <l n="166">To nature dead , he must adopt vile art ,</l>
     <l n="167">And wear a smile , with anguish in his heart .</l>
     <l n="168">A sense of honour would destroy his schemes ,</l>
     <l n="169">And conscience ne'er must speak unless in dreams .</l>
     <l n="170">When he hath tamely borne , for many years ,</l>
     <l n="171">Cold looks , forbidding frowns , contemptuous sneers , 170</l>
     <l n="172">When he at last expects , good easy man !</l>
     <l n="173">To reap the profits of his labour 'd plan ,</l>
     <l n="174">Some cringing lackey , or rapacious whore ,</l>
     <l n="175">To favours of the great the surest door ,</l>
     <l n="176">Some catamite , or pimp , in credit grown ,</l>
     <l n="177">Who tempts another 's wife , or sells his own ,</l>
     <l n="178">Steps ‘ cross his hopes , the promised boon denies ,</l>
     <l n="179">And for some minion 's minion claims the prize .</l>
     <l n="180">Foe to restraint , unpractised in deceit ,</l>
     <l n="181">Too resolute , from nature 's active heat , 180</l>
     <l n="182">To brook affronts , and tamely pass them by ,</l>
     <l n="183">Too proud to flatter , too sincere to lie ,</l>
     <l n="184">Too plain to please , too honest to be great ,</l>
     <l n="185">Give me , kind Heaven , an humbler , happier state :</l>
     <l n="186">Far from the place where men with pride deceive ,</l>
     <l n="187">Where rascals promise , and where fools believe ;</l>
     <l n="188">Far from the walk of folly , vice , and strife ,</l>
     <l n="189">Calm , independent , let me steal through life ;</l>
     <l n="190">Nor one vain wish my steady thoughts beguile</l>
     <l n="191">To fear his Lordship 's frown , or court his smile . 190</l>
     <l n="192">Unfit for greatness , I her snares defy ,</l>
     <l n="193">And look on riches with untainted eye :</l>
     <l n="194">To others let the glittering baubles fall ,</l>
     <l n="195">Content shall place us far above them all .</l>
     <l n="196">Spectators only on this bustling stage ,</l>
     <l n="197">We see what vain designs mankind engage :</l>

     <l n="208">Britons , like Roman spirits famed of old ,</l>

     <l n="254">His useless scales are in a corner flung ,</l>
     <l n="255">And Europe 's balance hangs upon his tongue .</l>
     <l n="256">Peace to such triflers ! be our happier plan</l>

     <l n="272">No statesman e'er will find it worth his pains</l>

     <l n="274">Burthens like these , vile earthly buildings bear ;</l>
     <l n="275">No tribute 's laid on castles in the air .</l>
     <l n="276">Let , then , the flames of war destructive reign ,</l>
     <l n="277">And England 's terrors awe imperious Spain ;</l>

     <l n="281">And tax on tax with double burthen rise ; 280</l>
     <l n="282">Exempt we sit , by no rude cares oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="283">And , having little , are with little bless 'd .</l>
     <l n="284">All real ills in dark oblivion lie ,</l>
     <l n="285">And joys , by fancy form 'd , their place supply ;</l>
     <l n="286">Night 's laughing hours unheeded slip away ,</l>
     <l n="287">Nor one dull thought foretells approach of day .</l>
     <l n="288">Thus have we lived , and whilst the Fates afford</l>

     <l n="294">Whilst frank Good-humour consecrates the treat ,</l>
     <l n="295">And woman makes society complete ,</l>
     <l n="296">Thus will we live , though in our teeth are hurl 'd</l>
     <l n="297">Those hackney strumpets , Prudence and the World .</l>
     <l n="298">Prudence , of old a sacred term , implied</l>
     <l n="299">Virtue , with godlike wisdom for her guide ;</l>
     <l n="300">But now in general use is known to mean</l>
     <l n="301">The stalking-horse of vice , and folly 's screen . 300</l>
     <l n="302">The sense perverted , we retain the name ;</l>
     <l n="303">Hypocrisy and Prudence are the same .</l>
     <l n="304">A tutor once , more read in men than books ,</l>
     <l n="305">A kind of crafty knowledge in his looks ,</l>
     <l n="306">Demurely sly , with high preferment bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="307">His favourite pupil in these words address 'd :—</l>
     <l n="308">Wouldst thou , my son , be wise and virtuous deem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="309">By all mankind a prodigy esteem 'd ?</l>
     <l n="310">Be this thy rule ; be what men prudent call ;</l>
     <l n="311">Prudence , almighty Prudence , gives thee all . 310</l>
     <l n="312">Keep up appearances ; there lies the test ;</l>
     <l n="313">The world will give thee credit for the rest .</l>
     <l n="314">Outward be fair , however foul within ;</l>
     <l n="315">Sin if thou wilt , but then in secret sin .</l>
     <l n="316">This maxim 's into common favour grown ,</l>
     <l n="317">Vice is no longer vice , unless ‘ tis known .</l>
     <l n="318">Virtue , indeed , may barefaced take the field ;</l>
     <l n="319">But vice is virtue when ‘ tis well conceal 'd .</l>
     <l n="320">Should raging passion drive thee to a whore ,</l>
     <l n="321">Let Prudence lead thee to a postern door ; 320</l>
     <l n="322">Stay out all night , but take especial care</l>
     <l n="323">That Prudence bring thee back to early prayer .</l>
     <l n="324">As one with watching and with study faint ,</l>
     <l n="325">Reel in a drunkard , and reel out a saint .</l>
     <l n="326">With joy the youth this useful lesson heard ,</l>
     <l n="327">And in his memory stored each precious word ;</l>
     <l n="328">Successfully pursued the plan , and now ,</l>
     <l n="329">Room for my Lord — Virtue , stand by and bow .</l>
     <l n="330">And is this all — is this the worldling 's art ,</l>
     <l n="331">To mask , but not amend a vicious heart 330</l>
     <l n="332">Shall lukewarm caution , and demeanour grave ,</l>
     <l n="333">For wise and good stamp every supple knave</l>
     <l n="334">Shall wretches , whom no real virtue warms ,</l>
     <l n="335">Gild fair their names and states with empty forms ;</l>
     <l n="336">While Virtue seeks in vain the wish'dhYpppHeNfor prize ,</l>
     <l n="337">Because , disdaining ill , she hates disguise ;</l>
     <l n="338">Because she frankly pours fourth all her store ,</l>
     <l n="339">Seems what she is , and scorns to pass for more</l>
     <l n="340">Well — be it so — let vile dissemblers hold</l>
     <l n="341">Unenvied power , and boast their dear-bought gold ; 340</l>
     <l n="342">Me neither power shall tempt , nor thirst of pelf ,</l>
     <l n="343">To flatter others , or deny myself ;</l>
     <l n="344">Might the whole world be placed within my span ,</l>
     <l n="345">I would not be that thing , that prudent man .</l>
     <l n="346">What ! cries Sir Pliant , would you then oppose</l>
     <l n="347">Yourself , alone , against a host of foes ?</l>
     <l n="348">Let not conceit , and peevish lust to rail ,</l>
     <l n="349">Above all sense of interest prevail .</l>
     <l n="350">Throw off , for shame ! this petulance of wit ;</l>
     <l n="351">Be wise , be modest , and for once submit : 350</l>
     <l n="352">Too hard the task ‘ gainst multitudes to fight ;</l>
     <l n="353">You must be wrong ; the World is in the right .</l>
     <l n="354">What is this World ?— A term which men have got</l>
     <l n="355">To signify , not one in ten knows what ;</l>
     <l n="356">A term , which with no more precision passes</l>
     <l n="357">To point out herds of men than herds of asses ;</l>
     <l n="358">In common use no more it means , we find ,</l>
     <l n="359">Than many fools in same opinions join 'd .</l>
     <l n="360">Can numbers , then , change Nature 's stated laws ?</l>
     <l n="361">Can numbers make the worse the better cause ? 360</l>
     <l n="362">Vice must be vice , virtue be virtue still ,</l>
     <l n="363">Though thousands rail at good , and practise ill .</l>
     <l n="364">Wouldst thou defend the Gaul 's destructive rage ,</l>
     <l n="365">Because vast nations on his part engage ?</l>
     <l n="366">Though , to support the rebel Caesar 's cause ,</l>
     <l n="367">Tumultuous legions arm against the laws ;</l>
     <l n="368">Though scandal would our patriot 's name impeach ,</l>
     <l n="369">And rails at virtues which she cannot reach ,</l>
     <l n="370">What honest man but would with joy submit</l>
     <l n="371">To bleed with Cato , and retire with Pitt ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>370</l>
     <l n="372">Steadfast and true to virtue 's sacred laws ,</l>
     <l n="373">Unmoved by vulgar censure , or applause ,</l>
     <l n="374">Let the World talk , my friend ; that World , we know ,</l>
     <l n="375">Which calls us guilty , cannot make us so .</l>
     <l n="376">Unawed by numbers , follow Nature 's plan ;</l>
     <l n="377">Assert the rights , or quit the name of man .</l>
     <l n="378">Consider well , weigh strictly right and wrong ;</l>
     <l n="379">Resolve not quick , but once resolved , be strong .</l>
     <l n="380">In spite of Dulness , and in spite of Wit ,</l>
     <l n="381">If to thyself thou canst thyself acquit , 380</l>
     <l n="382">Rather stand up , assured with conscious pride ,</l>
     <l n="383">Alone , than err with millions on thy side .</l>

     <l n="2">When Cupid first instructs his darts to fly</l>
     <l n="3">From the sly corner of some cook-maid 's eye ,</l>
     <l n="4">The stripling raw , just enter 'd in his teens ,</l>
     <l n="5">Receives the wound , and wonders what it means ;</l>
     <l n="6">His heart , like dripping , melts , and new desire</l>
     <l n="7">Within him stirs , each time she stirs the fire ;</l>
     <l n="8">Trembling and blushing , he the fair one views ,</l>
     <l n="9">And fain would speak , but can n't — without a Muse .</l>
     <l n="10">So to the sacred mount he takes his way ,</l>
     <l n="11">Prunes his young wings , and tunes his infant lay , 10</l>
     <l n="12">His oaten reed to rural ditties frames ,</l>
     <l n="13">To flocks and rocks , to hills and rills , proclaims ,</l>
     <l n="14">In simplest notes , and all unpolish 'd strains ,</l>
     <l n="15">The loves of nymphs , and eke the loves of swains .</l>
     <l n="16">Clad , as your nymphs were always clad of yore ,</l>
     <l n="17">In rustic weeds — a cook-maid now no more —</l>
     <l n="18">Beneath an aged oak Lardella lies —</l>
     <l n="19">Green moss her couch , her canopy the skies .</l>
     <l n="20">From aromatic shrubs the roguish gale</l>
     <l n="21">Steals young perfumes and wafts them through the vale . 20</l>
     <l n="22">The youth , turn 'd swain , and skill 'd in rustic lays ,</l>
     <l n="23">Fast by her side his amorous descant plays .</l>
     <l n="24">Herds low , flocks bleat , pies chatter , ravens scream ,</l>
     <l n="25">And the full chorus dies a-down the stream :</l>
     <l n="26">The streams , with music freighted , as they pass</l>
     <l n="27">Present the fair Lardella with a glass ;</l>
     <l n="28">And Zephyr , to complete the love-sick plan ,</l>
     <l n="29">Waves his light wings , and serves her for a fan .</l>
     <l n="30">But when maturer Judgment takes the lead ,</l>
     <l n="31">These childish toys on Reason 's altar bleed ; 30</l>

     <l n="35">And founds his merit on our servile fears ;</l>

     <l n="44">Trifles are dignified , and taught to wear</l>
     <l n="45">The robes of ancients with a modern air ;</l>
     <l n="46">Nonsense with classic ornaments is graced ,</l>

     <l n="330">In quest of food , efts strove in vain to crawl ;</l>
     <l n="331">Slugs , pinch 'd with hunger , smear 'd the slimy wall : 330</l>
     <l n="332">The cave around with hissing serpents rung ;</l>
     <l n="333">On the damp roof unhealthy vapour hung ;</l>
     <l n="334">And Famine , by her children always known ,</l>
     <l n="335">As proud as poor , here fix 'd her native throne .</l>
     <l n="336">Here , for the sullen sky was overcast ,</l>
     <l n="337">And summer shrunk beneath a wintry blast —</l>
     <l n="338">A native blast , which , arm 'd with hail and rain ,</l>
     <l n="339">Beat unrelenting on the naked swain ,</l>
     <l n="340">The boys for shelter made ; behind , the sheep ,</l>
     <l n="341">Of which those shepherds every day take keep , 340</l>
     <l n="342">Sickly crept on , and , with complainings rude ,</l>

     <l n="115">Assisted those who ‘ gainst their king made head ,</l>
     <l n="116">And gave the traitors refuge when they fled ? 510</l>

     <l n="118">And pitch 'd her standard in the fields of France ,</l>
     <l n="119">What if , disdaining oaths ,— an empty sound ,</l>
     <l n="120">By which our nation never shall be bound ,—</l>
     <l n="121">Bravely we taught unmuzzled War to roam ,</l>

     <l n="49">Then shalt thou find , whilst friends with foes conspire ,</l>
     <l n="50">To give more proof than virtue would desire , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Thy danger chiefly lies in acting well ;</l>

     <l n="346">And to secure thy credit , blast his own ,</l>
     <l n="347">In Hogarth he was sure to find a friend ;</l>
     <l n="348">He could not fear , and therefore might commend .</l>
     <l n="349">But when his spirit , roused by honest shame ,</l>
     <l n="350">Shook off that lethargy , and soar 'd to fame ; 350</l>
     <l n="351">When , with the pride of man , resolved and strong ,</l>
     <l n="352">He scorn 'd those fears which did his honour wrong ,</l>
     <l n="353">And , on himself determined to rely ,</l>
     <l n="354">Brought forth his labours to the public eye ,</l>
     <l n="355">No friend in thee could such a rebel know ;</l>
     <l n="356">He had desert , and Hogarth was his foe .</l>
     <l n="357">Souls of a timorous cast , of petty name</l>
     <l n="358">In Envy 's court , not yet quite dead to shame ,</l>
     <l n="359">May some remorse , some qualms of conscience feel ,</l>
     <l n="360">And suffer honour to abate their zeal ; 360</l>
     <l n="361">But the man truly and completely great ,</l>
     <l n="362">Allows no rule of action but his hate ;</l>
     <l n="363">Through every bar he bravely breaks his way ,</l>
     <l n="364">Passion his principle , and parts his prey .</l>
     <l n="365">Mediums in vice and virtue speak a mind</l>
     <l n="366">Within the pale of temperance confined ;</l>
     <l n="367">The daring spirit scorns her narrow schemes ,</l>
     <l n="368">And , good or bad , is always in extremes .</l>
     <l n="369">Man 's practice duly weigh 'd , through every age</l>
     <l n="370">On the same plan hath Envy form 'd her rage , 370</l>
     <l n="371">‘ Gainst those whom fortune hath our rivals made ,</l>
     <l n="372">In way of science , and in way of trade :</l>
     <l n="373">Stung with mean jealousy she arms her spite ,</l>
     <l n="374">First works , then views their ruin with delight .</l>
     <l n="375">Our Hogarth here a grand improver shines ,</l>
     <l n="376">And nobly on the general plan refines ;</l>
     <l n="377">He like himself o'erleaps the servile bound ;</l>
     <l n="378">Worth is his mark , wherever worth is found .</l>
     <l n="379">Should painters only his vast wrath suffice ?</l>
     <l n="380">Genius in every walk is lawful prize : 380</l>
     <l n="381">‘ Tis a gross insult to his o'ergrown state ;</l>
     <l n="382">His love to merit is to feel his hate .</l>
     <l n="383">When Wilkes , our countryman , our common friend ,</l>
     <l n="384">Arose , his king , his country to defend ;</l>
     <l n="385">When tools of power he bared to public view ,</l>
     <l n="386">And from their holes the sneaking cowards drew ;</l>
     <l n="387">When Rancour found it far beyond her reach</l>
     <l n="388">To soil his honour , and his truth impeach ;</l>
     <l n="389">What could induce thee , at a time and place</l>
     <l n="390">Where manly foes had blush 'd to show their face , 390</l>
     <l n="391">To make that effort which must damn thy name ,</l>
     <l n="392">And sink thee deep , deep in thy grave with shame ?</l>
     <l n="393">Did virtue move thee ? No ; ‘ twas pride , rank pride ,</l>
     <l n="394">And if thou hadst not done it , thou hadst died .</l>
     <l n="395">Malice ( who , disappointed of her end ,</l>
     <l n="396">Whether to work the bane of foe or friend ,</l>
     <l n="397">Preys on herself , and , driven to the stake ,</l>
     <l n="398">Gives Virtue that revenge she scorns to take )</l>
     <l n="399">Had kill 'd thee , tottering on life 's utmost verge ,</l>
     <l n="400">Had Wilkes and Liberty escaped thy scourge . 400</l>
     <l n="401">When that Great Charter , which our fathers bought</l>
     <l n="402">With their best blood , was into question brought ;</l>
     <l n="403">When , big with ruin , o'er each English head</l>
     <l n="404">Vile Slavery hung suspended by a thread ;</l>
     <l n="405">When Liberty , all trembling and aghast ,</l>
     <l n="406">Fear 'd for the future , knowing what was past ;</l>
     <l n="407">When every breast was chill 'd with deep despair ,</l>
     <l n="408">Till Reason pointed out that Pratt<span type="note_anchor">[ 129 ]</span>was there ;—</l>
     <l n="409">Lurking , most ruffian-like , behind the screen ,</l>
     <l n="410">So placed all things to see , himself unseen , 410</l>
     <l n="411">Virtue , with due contempt , saw Hogarth stand ,</l>
     <l n="412">The murderous pencil in his palsied hand .</l>
     <l n="413">What was the cause of Liberty to him ,</l>
     <l n="414">Or what was Honour ? let them sink or swim ,</l>
     <l n="415">So he may gratify , without control ,</l>
     <l n="416">The mean resentments of his selfish soul ;</l>
     <l n="417">Let Freedom perish , if , to Freedom true ,</l>
     <l n="418">In the same ruin Wilkes may perish too .</l>
     <l n="419">With all the symptoms of assured decay ,</l>
     <l n="420">With age and sickness pinch 'd and worn away , 420</l>
     <l n="421">Pale quivering lips , lank cheeks , and faltering tongue ,</l>
     <l n="422">The spirits out of tune , the nerves unstrung ,</l>
     <l n="423">Thy body shrivell 'd up , thy dim eyes sunk</l>
     <l n="424">Within their sockets deep , thy weak hams shrunk ,</l>
     <l n="425">The body 's weight unable to sustain ,</l>
     <l n="426">The stream of life scarce trembling through the vein ,</l>
     <l n="427">More than half kill 'd by honest truths which fell ,</l>
     <l n="428">Through thy own fault , from men who wish 'd thee well —</l>
     <l n="429">Canst thou , e'en thus , thy thoughts to vengeance give ,</l>
     <l n="430">And , dead to all things else , to malice live ? 430</l>
     <l n="431">Hence , dotard , to thy closet ; shut thee in ;</l>
     <l n="432">By deep repentance wash away thy sin ;</l>
     <l n="433">From haunts of men to shame and sorrow fly ,</l>
     <l n="434">And , on the verge of death , learn how to die !</l>
     <l n="435">Vain exhortation ! wash the Ethiop white ,</l>
     <l n="436">Discharge the leopard 's spots , turn day to night ,</l>
     <l n="437">Control the course of Nature , bid the deep</l>
     <l n="438">Hush at thy pigmy voice her waves to sleep —</l>
     <l n="439">Perform things passing strange , yet own thy art</l>
     <l n="440">Too weak to work a change in such a heart ; 440</l>
     <l n="441">That Envy , which was woven in the frame</l>
     <l n="442">At first , will to the last remain the same .</l>
     <l n="443">Reason may droop , may die ; but Envy 's rage</l>
     <l n="444">Improves by time , and gathers strength from age .</l>
     <l n="445">Some , and not few , vain triflers with the pen ,</l>
     <l n="446">Unread , unpractised in the ways of men ,</l>
     <l n="447">Tell us that Envy , who , with giant stride ,</l>
     <l n="448">Stalks through the vale of life by Virtue 's side ,</l>
     <l n="449">Retreats when she hath drawn her latest breath ,</l>
     <l n="450">And calmly hears her praises after death . 450</l>
     <l n="451">To such observers Hogarth gives the lie ;</l>
     <l n="452">Worth may be hearsed , but Envy cannot die ;</l>
     <l n="453">Within the mansion of his gloomy breast ,</l>
     <l n="454">A mansion suited well to such a guest ,</l>
     <l n="455">Immortal , unimpair 'd , she rears her head ,</l>
     <l n="456">And damns alike the living and the dead .</l>
     <l n="457">Oft have I known thee , Hogarth , weak and vain ,</l>
     <l n="458">Thyself the idol of thy awkward strain ,</l>
     <l n="459">Through the dull measure of a summer 's day ,</l>
     <l n="460">In phrase most vile , prate long , long hours away , 460</l>
     <l n="461">Whilst friends with friends , all gaping sit , and gaze ,</l>
     <l n="462">To hear a Hogarth babble Hogarth 's praise .</l>
     <l n="463">But if athwart thee Interruption came ,</l>
     <l n="464">And mention 'd with respect some ancient 's name ,</l>
     <l n="465">Some ancient 's name who , in the days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="466">The crown of Art with greatest honour wore ,</l>
     <l n="467">How have I seen thy coward cheek turn pale ,</l>
     <l n="468">And blank confusion seize thy mangled tale !</l>
     <l n="469">How hath thy jealousy to madness grown ,</l>
     <l n="470">And deem 'd his praise injurious to thy own ! 470</l>
     <l n="471">Then without mercy did thy wrath make way ,</l>
     <l n="472">And arts and artists all became thy prey ;</l>
     <l n="473">Then didst thou trample on establish 'd rules ,</l>
     <l n="474">And proudly levell 'd all the ancient schools ;</l>
     <l n="475">Condemn 'd those works , with praise through ages graced ,</l>
     <l n="476">Which you had never seen , or could not taste ;</l>
     <l n="477">But would mankind have true perfection shown ,</l>
     <l n="478">It must be found in labours of my own :</l>
     <l n="479">I dare to challenge , in one single piece ,</l>
     <l n="480">The united force of Italy and Greece . 480</l>
     <l n="481">Thy eager hand the curtain then undrew ,</l>
     <l n="482">And brought the boasted masterpiece to view .</l>
     <l n="483">Spare thy remarks — say not a single word —</l>
     <l n="484">The picture seen , why is the painter heard ?</l>
     <l n="485">Call not up shame and anger in our cheeks ;</l>
     <l n="486">Without a comment Sigismunda<span type="note_anchor">[ 130 ]</span>speaks .</l>
     <l n="487">Poor Sigismunda ! what a fate is thine !</l>
     <l n="488">Dryden , the great high-priest of all the Nine ,</l>
     <l n="489">Revived thy name , gave what a Muse could give ,</l>
     <l n="490">And in his numbers bade thy memory live ; 490</l>
     <l n="491">Gave thee those soft sensations which might move</l>
     <l n="492">And warm the coldest anchorite to love ;</l>
     <l n="493">Gave thee that virtue , which could curb desire ,</l>
     <l n="494">Refine and consecrate love 's headstrong fire ;</l>
     <l n="495">Gave thee those griefs , which made the Stoic feel ,</l>
     <l n="496">And call 'd compassion forth from hearts of steel ;</l>
     <l n="497">Gave thee that firmness , which our sex may shame ,</l>
     <l n="498">And make man bow to woman 's juster claim ;</l>
     <l n="499">So that our tears , which from compassion flow ,</l>
     <l n="500">Seem to debase thy dignity of woe . 500</l>
     <l n="501">But , oh , how much unlike ! how fallen ! how changed !</l>
     <l n="502">How much from Nature and herself estranged !</l>
     <l n="503">How totally deprived of all the powers</l>
     <l n="504">To show her feelings , and awaken ours ,</l>
     <l n="505">Doth Sigismunda now devoted stand ,</l>
     <l n="506">The helpless victim of a dauber 's hand !</l>
     <l n="507">But why , my Hogarth , such a progress made ,</l>
     <l n="508">So rare a pattern for the sign-post trade ,</l>
     <l n="509">In the full force and whirlwind of thy pride ,</l>
     <l n="510">Why was heroic painting laid aside ? 510</l>
     <l n="511">Why is it not resumed ? thy friends at court ,</l>
     <l n="512">Men all in place and power , crave thy support ;</l>
     <l n="513">Be grateful then for once , and through the field</l>
     <l n="514">Of politics thy epic pencil wield ;</l>
     <l n="515">Maintain the cause , which they , good lack ! avow ,</l>
     <l n="516">And would maintain too , but they know not how .</l>
     <l n="517">Through every pannel let thy virtue tell</l>
     <l n="518">How Bute prevail 'd , how Pitt and Temple fell ;</l>
     <l n="519">How England 's sons ( whom they conspired to bless .</l>
     <l n="520">Against our will , with insolent success ) 520</l>
     <l n="521">Approve their fall , and with addresses run —</l>
     <l n="522">How got , God knows — to hail the Scottish sun ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 131 ]</span></l>
     <l n="523">Point out our fame in war , when vengeance , hurl 'd</l>
     <l n="524">From the strong arm of Justice , shook the world ;</l>
     <l n="525">Thine , and thy country 's honour to increase ,</l>
     <l n="526">Point out the honours of succeeding peace ;</l>
     <l n="527">Our moderation , Christian-like , display ,</l>
     <l n="528">Show what we got , and what we gave away ;</l>
     <l n="529">In colours , dull and heavy as the tale ,</l>
     <l n="530">Let a state-chaos through the whole prevail . 530</l>
     <l n="531">But , of events regardless , whilst the Muse ,</l>
     <l n="532">Perhaps with too much heat , her theme pursues ;</l>
     <l n="533">Whilst her quick spirits rouse at Freedom 's call ,</l>
     <l n="534">And every drop of blood is turn 'd to gall ;</l>
     <l n="535">Whilst a dear country , and an injured friend ,</l>
     <l n="536">Urge my strong anger to the bitterest end ;</l>
     <l n="537">Whilst honest trophies to Revenge are raised ,</l>
     <l n="538">Let not one real virtue pass unpraised ;</l>
     <l n="539">Justice with equal course bids Satire flow ,</l>
     <l n="540">And loves the virtue of her greatest foe . 540</l>
     <l n="541">Oh ! that I here could that rare virtue mean ,</l>
     <l n="542">Which scorns the rule of envy , pride , and spleen ,</l>
     <l n="543">Which springs not from the labour 'd works of art ,</l>
     <l n="544">But hath its rise from Nature in the heart ;</l>
     <l n="545">Which in itself with happiness is crown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="546">And spreads with joy the blessing all around !</l>
     <l n="547">But truth forbids , and in these simple lays ,</l>
     <l n="548">Contented with a different kind of praise ,</l>
     <l n="549">Must Hogarth stand ; that praise which Genius gives ,</l>
     <l n="550">In which to latest time the artist lives , 550</l>
     <l n="551">But not the man ; which , rightly understood ,</l>
     <l n="552">May make us great , but cannot make us good :</l>
     <l n="553">That praise be Hogarth 's ; freely let him wear</l>
     <l n="554">The wreath which Genius wove , and planted there :</l>
     <l n="555">Foe as I am , should Envy tear it down ,</l>
     <l n="556">Myself would labour to replace the crown .</l>
     <l n="557">In walks of humour , in that cast of style ,</l>
     <l n="558">Which , probing to the quick , yet makes us smile ;</l>
     <l n="559">In comedy , his natural road to fame ,—</l>
     <l n="560">Nor let me call it by a meaner name , 560</l>
     <l n="561">Where a beginning , middle , and an end ,</l>
     <l n="562">Are aptly join 'd ; where parts on parts depend ,</l>
     <l n="563">Each made for each , as bodies for their soul ,</l>
     <l n="564">So as to form one true and perfect whole ;</l>
     <l n="565">Where a plain story to the eye is told ,</l>
     <l n="566">Which we conceive the moment we behold ,—</l>
     <l n="567">Hogarth unrivall 'd stands , and shall engage</l>
     <l n="568">Unrivall 'd praise to the most distant age .</l>
     <l n="569">How couldst thou , then , to shame perversely run ,</l>
     <l n="570">And tread that path which Nature bade thee shun ? 570</l>
     <l n="571">Why did ambition overleap her rules ,</l>
     <l n="572">And thy vast parts become the sport of fools ?</l>
     <l n="573">By different methods different men excel ;</l>
     <l n="574">But where is he who can do all things well ?</l>
     <l n="575">Humour thy province , for some monstrous crime</l>
     <l n="576">Pride struck thee with the frenzy of sublime ;</l>
     <l n="577">But , when the work was finish 'd , could thy mind</l>
     <l n="578">So partial be , and to herself so blind ,</l>
     <l n="579">What with contempt all view 'd , to view with awe ,</l>
     <l n="580">Nor see those faults which every blockhead saw ? 580</l>
     <l n="581">Blush , thou vain man ! and if desire of fame ,</l>
     <l n="582">Founded on real art , thy thoughts inflame ,</l>
     <l n="583">To quick destruction Sigismunda give ,</l>
     <l n="584">And let her memory die , that thine may live .</l>
     <l n="585">But should fond Candour , for her mercy sake ,</l>
     <l n="586">With pity view , and pardon this mistake ;</l>
     <l n="587">Or should Oblivion , to thy wish most kind ,</l>
     <l n="588">Wipe off that stain , nor leave one trace behind ;</l>
     <l n="589">Of arts despised , of artists , by thy frown</l>
     <l n="590">Awed from just hopes , of rising worth kept down , 590</l>
     <l n="591">Of all thy meanness through this mortal race ,</l>
     <l n="592">Canst thou the living memory erase ?</l>
     <l n="593">Or shall not vengeance follow to the grave ,</l>
     <l n="594">And give back just that measure which you gave ?</l>
     <l n="595">With so much merit , and so much success ,</l>
     <l n="596">With so much power to curse , so much to bless ,</l>
     <l n="597">Would he have been man 's friend , instead of foe ,</l>
     <l n="598">Hogarth had been a little god below .</l>
     <l n="599">Why , then , like savage giants , famed of old ,</l>
     <l n="600">Of whom in Scripture story we are told , 600</l>
     <l n="601">Dost thou in cruelty that strength employ ,</l>
     <l n="602">Which Nature meant to save , not to destroy ?</l>
     <l n="603">Why dost thou , all in horrid pomp array 'd ,</l>
     <l n="604">Sit grinning o'er the ruins thou hast made ?</l>
     <l n="605">Most rank ill-nature must applaud thy art ,</l>
     <l n="606">But even Candour must condemn thy heart .</l>
     <l n="607">For me , who , warm and zealous for my friend ,</l>
     <l n="608">In spite of railing thousands , will commend ;</l>
     <l n="609">And no less warm and zealous ‘ gainst my foes ,</l>
     <l n="610">Spite of commending thousands , will oppose , 610</l>
     <l n="611">I dare thy worst , with scorn behold thy rage ,</l>
     <l n="612">But with an eye of pity view thy age ;</l>
     <l n="613">Thy feeble age , in which , as in a glass ,</l>
     <l n="614">We see how men to dissolution pass .</l>
     <l n="615">Thou wretched being , whom , on Reason 's plan ,</l>
     <l n="616">So changed , so lost , I cannot call a man ,</l>
     <l n="617">What could persuade thee , at this time of life ,</l>
     <l n="618">To launch afresh into the sea of strife ?</l>
     <l n="619">Better for thee , scarce crawling on the earth ,</l>
     <l n="620">Almost as much a child as at thy birth , 620</l>
     <l n="621">To have resign 'd in peace thy parting breath ,</l>
     <l n="622">And sunk unnoticed in the arms of Death .</l>
     <l n="623">Why would thy gray , gray hairs resentment brave ,</l>
     <l n="624">Thus to go down with sorrow to the grave ?</l>
     <l n="625">Now , by my soul ! it makes me blush to know ,</l>
     <l n="626">My spirit could descend to such a foe :</l>
     <l n="627">Whatever cause the vengeance might provoke ,</l>
     <l n="628">It seems rank cowardice to give the stroke .</l>
     <l n="629">Sure ‘ tis a curse which angry fates impose ,</l>
     <l n="630">To mortify man 's arrogance , that those 630</l>
     <l n="631">Who 're fashion 'd of some better sort of clay ,</l>
     <l n="632">Much sooner than the common herd decay .</l>
     <l n="633">What bitter pangs must humbled Genius feel ,</l>
     <l n="634">In their last hours to view a Swift and Steele !</l>
     <l n="635">How must ill-boding horrors fill her breast ,</l>

     <l n="188">Which makes death more than victory .</l>
     <l n="189">Hail , those old patriots ! on whose tongue</l>

     <l n="200">On Lethe 's stream , like flags , to rot ? 200</l>
     <l n="201">No — they shall live , and each fair name ,</l>
     <l n="202">Recorded in the book of Fame ,</l>
     <l n="203">Founded on Honour 's basis , fast</l>
     <l n="204">As the round earth to ages last .</l>
     <l n="205">Some virtues vanish with our breath ;</l>
     <l n="206">Virtue like this lives after death .</l>
     <l n="207">Old Time himself , his scythe thrown by ,</l>
     <l n="208">Himself lost in eternity ,</l>
     <l n="209">An everlasting crown shall twine</l>
     <l n="210">To make a Wilkes and Sidney join . 210</l>
     <l n="211">But should some slave-got villain dare</l>
     <l n="212">Chains for his country to prepare ,</l>
     <l n="213">And , by his birth to slavery broke ,</l>
     <l n="214">Make her , too , feel the galling yoke ,</l>
     <l n="215">May he be evermore accursed ,</l>
     <l n="216">Amongst bad men be rank 'd the worst ;</l>
     <l n="217">May he be still himself , and still</l>
     <l n="218">Go on in vice , and perfect ill ;</l>
     <l n="219">May his broad crimes each day increase ,</l>
     <l n="220">Till he can n't live , nor die in peace ; 220</l>
     <l n="221">May he be plunged so deep in shame ,</l>
     <l n="222">That Satan may n't endure his name ,</l>
     <l n="223">And hear , scarce crawling on the earth ,</l>
     <l n="224">His children curse him for their birth ;</l>
     <l n="225">May Liberty , beyond the grave ,</l>
     <l n="226">Ordain him to be still a slave ,</l>
     <l n="227">Grant him what here he most requires ,</l>

     <l n="231">Placing in craft his confidence ,</l>
     <l n="232">And making honour a pretence</l>
     <l n="233">To do a deed of deepest shame ,</l>
     <l n="234">Whilst filthy lucre is his aim ;</l>

     <l n="236">Contrive to practise ‘ gainst the life</l>
     <l n="237">Of one who , honour 'd through the land ,</l>
     <l n="238">For Freedom made a glorious stand ;</l>
     <l n="239">Whose chief , perhaps his only crime ,</l>
     <l n="240">Is ( if plain Truth at such a time 240</l>
     <l n="241">May dare her sentiments to tell )</l>
     <l n="242">That he his country loves too well :</l>
     <l n="243">May he — but words are all too weak</l>
     <l n="244">The feelings of my heart to speak —</l>
     <l n="245">May he — oh for a noble curse ,</l>
     <l n="246">Which might his very marrow pierce !—</l>

     <l n="1">Deep in the bosom of a wood ,</l>
     <l n="2">Out of the road , a Temple<span type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span>stood :</l>
     <l n="3">Ancient , and much the worse for wear ,</l>
     <l n="4">It call 'd aloud for quick repair ,</l>
     <l n="5">And , tottering from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="6">Menaced destruction far and wide ;</l>
     <l n="7">Nor able seem 'd , unless made stronger ,</l>
     <l n="8">To hold out four or five years longer .</l>
     <l n="9">Four hundred pillars , from the ground</l>
     <l n="10">Rising in order , most unsound , 10</l>
     <l n="11">Some rotten to the heart , aloof</l>
     <l n="12">Seem 'd to support the tottering roof ,</l>
     <l n="13">But , to inspection nearer laid ,</l>
     <l n="14">Instead of giving , wanted aid .</l>
     <l n="15">The structure , rare and curious , made</l>
     <l n="16">By men most famous in their trade ,</l>
     <l n="17">A work of years , admired by all ,</l>
     <l n="18">Was suffer 'd into dust to fall ;</l>
     <l n="19">Or , just to make it hang together ,</l>
     <l n="20">And keep off the effects of weather , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Was patch 'd and patch 'd from time to time</l>
     <l n="22">By wretches , whom it were a crime ,</l>
     <l n="23">A crime , which Art would treason hold</l>
     <l n="24">To mention with those names of old .</l>
     <l n="25">Builders , who had the pile survey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">And those not Flitcrofts<span type="note_anchor">[ 136 ]</span>in their trade ,</l>
     <l n="27">Doubted ( the wise hand in a doubt</l>
     <l n="28">Merely , sometimes , to hand her out )</l>
     <l n="29">Whether ( like churches in a brief<span type="note_anchor">[ 137 ]</span>,</l>

     <l n="31">Through Chancery , who gives her fees</l>

     <l n="33">It must not , in all parts unsound ,</l>
     <l n="34">Be ripp 'd , and pull 'd down to the ground ;</l>
     <l n="35">Whether ( though after ages ne'er</l>

     <l n="37">Art , if they should their art employ ,</l>
     <l n="38">Meant to preserve , might not destroy ;</l>
     <l n="39">As human bodies , worn away ,</l>
     <l n="40">Batter 'd and hasting to decay , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Bidding the power of Art despair ,</l>
     <l n="42">Cannot those very medicines bear ,</l>
     <l n="43">Which , and which only , can restore ,</l>
     <l n="44">And make them healthy as before .</l>
     <l n="45">To Liberty , whose gracious smile</l>
     <l n="46">Shed peace and plenty o'er the isle ,</l>
     <l n="47">Our grateful ancestors , her plain</l>
     <l n="48">But faithful children , raised this fane .</l>
     <l n="49">Full in the front , stretch 'd out in length ,</l>
     <l n="50">Where Nature put forth all her strength 50</l>
     <l n="51">In spring eternal , lay a plain</l>
     <l n="52">Where our brave fathers used to train</l>
     <l n="53">Their sons to arms , to teach the art</l>
     <l n="54">Of war , and steel the infant heart .</l>
     <l n="55">Labour , their hardy nurse , when young ,</l>
     <l n="56">Their joints had knit , their nerves had strung ;</l>
     <l n="57">Abstinence , foe declared to Death ,</l>
     <l n="58">Had , from the time they first drew breath ,</l>
     <l n="59">The best of doctors , with plain food ,</l>
     <l n="60">Kept pure the channel of their blood ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">Health in their cheeks bade colour rise ,</l>
     <l n="62">And Glory sparkled in their eyes .</l>
     <l n="63">The instruments of husbandry ,</l>
     <l n="64">As in contempt , were all thrown by ,</l>
     <l n="65">And , flattering a manly pride ,</l>
     <l n="66">War 's keener tools their place supplied .</l>
     <l n="67">Their arrows to the head they drew ;</l>
     <l n="68">Swift to the points their javelins flew ;</l>
     <l n="69">They grasp 'd the sword , they shook the spear ;</l>
     <l n="70">Their fathers felt a pleasing fear ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">And even Courage , standing by ,</l>
     <l n="72">Scarcely beheld with steady eye .</l>
     <l n="73">Each stripling , lesson 'd by his sire ,</l>
     <l n="74">Knew when to close , when to retire ,</l>
     <l n="75">When near at hand , when from afar</l>
     <l n="76">To fight , and was himself a war .</l>
     <l n="77">Their wives , their mothers , all around ,</l>
     <l n="78">Careless of order , on the ground</l>
     <l n="79">Breathed forth to Heaven the pious vow ,</l>
     <l n="80">And for a son 's or husband 's brow , 80</l>
     <l n="81">With eager fingers , laurel wove ;</l>
     <l n="82">Laurel , which in the sacred grove ,</l>
     <l n="83">Planted by Liberty , they find ,</l>
     <l n="84">The brows of conquerors to bind ,</l>
     <l n="85">To give them pride and spirit , fit</l>
     <l n="86">To make a world in arms submit .</l>
     <l n="87">What raptures did the bosom fire</l>
     <l n="88">Of the young , rugged , peasant sire ,</l>
     <l n="89">When , from the toil of mimic fight ,</l>
     <l n="90">Returning with return of night , 90</l>
     <l n="91">He saw his babe resign the breast ,</l>
     <l n="92">And , smiling , stroke those arms in jest ,</l>
     <l n="93">With which hereafter he shall make</l>
     <l n="94">The proudest heart in Gallia quake !</l>
     <l n="95">Gods ! with what joy , what honest pride ,</l>
     <l n="96">Did each fond , wishing rustic bride</l>
     <l n="97">Behold her manly swain return !</l>
     <l n="98">How did her love-sick bosom burn ,</l>
     <l n="99">Though on parades he was not bred ,</l>
     <l n="100">Nor wore the livery of red , 100</l>
     <l n="101">When , Pleasure heightening all her charms ,</l>
     <l n="102">She strain 'd her warrior in her arms ,</l>
     <l n="103">And begg 'd , whilst love and glory fire ,</l>
     <l n="104">A son , a son just like his sire !</l>
     <l n="105">Such were the men in former times ,</l>
     <l n="106">Ere luxury had made our crimes</l>
     <l n="107">Our bitter punishment , who bore</l>
     <l n="108">Their terrors to a foreign shore :</l>
     <l n="109">Such were the men , who , free from dread ,</l>
     <l n="110">By Edwards and by Henries led , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Spread , like a torrent swell 'd with rains ,</l>
     <l n="112">O'er haughty Gallia 's trembling plains :</l>
     <l n="113">Such were the men , when lust of power ,</l>
     <l n="114">To work him woe , in evil hour</l>
     <l n="115">Debauch 'd the tyrant from those ways</l>
     <l n="116">On which a king should found his praise ;</l>
     <l n="117">When stern Oppression , hand in hand</l>
     <l n="118">With Pride , stalk 'd proudly through the land ;</l>
     <l n="119">When weeping Justice was misled</l>
     <l n="120">From her fair course , and Mercy dead : 120</l>
     <l n="121">Such were the men , in virtue strong ,</l>
     <l n="122">Who dared not see their country 's wrong ,</l>
     <l n="123">Who left the mattock and the spade ,</l>
     <l n="124">And , in the robes of War array 'd ,</l>
     <l n="125">In their rough arms , departing , took</l>
     <l n="126">Their helpless babes , and with a look</l>
     <l n="127">Stern and determined , swore to see</l>
     <l n="128">Those babes no more , or see them free :</l>
     <l n="129">Such were the men whom tyrant Pride</l>
     <l n="130">Could never fasten to his side 130</l>
     <l n="131">By threats or bribes ; who , freemen born ,</l>
     <l n="132">Chains , though of gold , beheld with scorn ;</l>
     <l n="133">Who , free from every servile awe ,</l>
     <l n="134">Could never be divorced from Law ,</l>
     <l n="135">From that broad general law , which Sense</l>
     <l n="136">Made for the general defence ;</l>
     <l n="137">Could never yield to partial ties</l>
     <l n="138">Which from dependant stations rise ;</l>
     <l n="139">Could never be to slavery led ,</l>
     <l n="140">For Property was at their head : 140</l>
     <l n="141">Such were the men , in days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="142">Who , call 'd by Liberty , before</l>
     <l n="143">Her temple on the sacred green ,</l>
     <l n="144">In martial pastimes oft were seen —</l>
     <l n="145">Now seen no longer — in their stead ,</l>
     <l n="146">To laziness and vermin bred ,</l>
     <l n="147">A race who , strangers to the cause</l>
     <l n="148">Of Freedom , live by other laws ,</l>
     <l n="149">On other motives fight , a prey</l>
     <l n="150">To interest , and slaves for pay . 150</l>
     <l n="151">Valour — how glorious , on a plan</l>
     <l n="152">Of honour founded !— leads their van ;</l>
     <l n="153">Discretion , free from taint of fear ,</l>
     <l n="154">Cool , but resolved , brings up their rear —</l>
     <l n="155">Discretion , Valour 's better half ;</l>
     <l n="156">Dependence holds the general 's staff .</l>
     <l n="157">In plain and home-spun garb array 'd ,</l>
     <l n="158">Not for vain show , but service made ,</l>
     <l n="159">In a green flourishing old age ,</l>
     <l n="160">Not damn 'd yet with an equipage , 160</l>
     <l n="161">In rules of Porterage untaught ,</l>
     <l n="162">Simplicity , not worth a groat ,</l>
     <l n="163">For years had kept the Temple-door ;</l>
     <l n="164">Full on his breast a glass he wore ,</l>
     <l n="165">Through which his bosom open lay</l>
     <l n="166">To every one who pass 'd that way :</l>
     <l n="167">Now turn 'd adrift , with humbler face ,</l>
     <l n="168">But prouder heart , his vacant place</l>
     <l n="169">Corruption fills , and bears the key ;</l>
     <l n="170">No entrance now without a fee . 170</l>
     <l n="171">With belly round , and full fat face ,</l>
     <l n="172">Which on the house reflected grace ,</l>
     <l n="173">Full of good fare , and honest glee ,</l>
     <l n="174">The steward Hospitality ,</l>
     <l n="175">Old Welcome smiling by his side ,</l>
     <l n="176">A good old servant , often tried ,</l>
     <l n="177">And faithful found , who kept in view</l>
     <l n="178">His lady 's fame and interest too ,</l>
     <l n="179">Who made each heart with joy rebound ,</l>
     <l n="180">Yet never ran her state aground , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Was turn 'd off , or ( which word I find</l>
     <l n="182">Is more in modern use ) resign 'd .<span type="note_anchor">[ 138 ]</span></l>
     <l n="183">Half-starved , half-starving others , bred</l>
     <l n="184">In beggary , with carrion fed ,</l>
     <l n="185">Detested , and detesting all ,</l>
     <l n="186">Made up of avarice and gall ,</l>
     <l n="187">Boasting great thrift , yet wasting more</l>
     <l n="188">Than ever steward did before ,</l>
     <l n="189">Succeeded one , who , to engage</l>
     <l n="190">The praise of an exhausted age , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Assumed a name of high degree ,</l>
     <l n="192">And call 'd himself Economy .</l>
     <l n="193">Within the Temple , full in sight ,</l>
     <l n="194">Where , without ceasing , day and night</l>
     <l n="195">The workmen toiled ; where Labour bared</l>
     <l n="196">His brawny arm ; where Art prepared ,</l>
     <l n="197">In regular and even rows ,</l>
     <l n="198">Her types , a printing-press arose ;</l>
     <l n="199">Each workman knew his task , and each</l>
     <l n="200">Was honest and expert as Leach .<span type="note_anchor">[ 139 ]</span>200</l>
     <l n="201">Hence Learning struck a deeper root ,</l>
     <l n="202">And Science brought forth riper fruit ;</l>
     <l n="203">Hence Loyalty received support ,</l>
     <l n="204">Even when banish 'd from the court ;</l>
     <l n="205">Hence Government gain 'd strength , and hence</l>
     <l n="206">Religion sought and found defence ;</l>
     <l n="207">Hence England 's fairest fame arose ,</l>
     <l n="208">And Liberty subdued her foes .</l>
     <l n="209">On a low , simple , turf-made throne ,</l>
     <l n="210">Raised by Allegiance , scarcely known 210</l>
     <l n="211">From her attendants , glad to be</l>
     <l n="212">Pattern of that equality</l>

     <l n="214">Safely consist with social good ,</l>
     <l n="215">The goddess sat ; around her head</l>

     <l n="221">Before her Magna Charta lay ,</l>
     <l n="222">Which some great lawyer , of his day</l>
     <l n="223">The Pratt ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 140 ]</span>was officed to explain ,</l>

     <l n="225">Peace , crown 'd with olive , to her breast</l>
     <l n="226">Two smiling twin-born infants press 'd ;</l>
     <l n="227">At her feet , couching , War was laid ,</l>

     <l n="229">Justice and Mercy , hand in hand , 230</l>
     <l n="230">Joint guardians of the happy land ,</l>
     <l n="231">Together held their mighty charge ,</l>

     <l n="4">False are his friends , and firm his foes :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">How much mistaken are the men who think</l>
     <l n="2">That all who will , without restraint may drink ,</l>
     <l n="3">May largely drink , e'en till their bowels burst ,</l>
     <l n="4">Pleading no right but merely that of thirst ,</l>
     <l n="5">At the pure waters of the living well ,</l>
     <l n="6">Beside whose streams the Muses love to dwell !</l>
     <l n="7">Verse is with them a knack , an idle toy ,</l>
     <l n="8">A rattle gilded o'er , on which a boy</l>
     <l n="9">May play untaught , whilst , without art or force ,</l>
     <l n="10">Make it but jingle , music comes of course . 10</l>
     <l n="11">Little do such men know the toil , the pains ,</l>
     <l n="12">The daily , nightly racking of the brains ,</l>
     <l n="13">To range the thoughts , the matter to digest ,</l>
     <l n="14">To cull fit phrases , and reject the rest ;</l>
     <l n="15">To know the times when Humour on the cheek</l>
     <l n="16">Of Mirth may hold her sports ; when Wit should speak ,</l>
     <l n="17">And when be silent ; when to use the powers</l>
     <l n="18">Of ornament , and how to place the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="19">So that they neither give a tawdry glare ,</l>
     <l n="20">‘ Nor waste their sweetness in the desert air ; ’ 20</l>
     <l n="21">To form , ( which few can do , and scarcely one ,</l>
     <l n="22">One critic in an age , can find when done )</l>
     <l n="23">To form a plan , to strike a grand outline ,</l>
     <l n="24">To fill it up , and make the picture shine</l>
     <l n="25">A full and perfect piece ; to make coy Rhyme</l>
     <l n="26">Renounce her follies , and with Sense keep time ;</l>
     <l n="27">To make proud Sense against her nature bend ,</l>
     <l n="28">And wear the chains of Rhyme , yet call her friend .</l>
     <l n="29">Some fops there are , amongst the scribbling tribe ,</l>
     <l n="30">Who make it all their business to describe , 30</l>
     <l n="31">No matter whether in or out of place ;</l>
     <l n="32">Studious of finery , and fond of lace ,</l>
     <l n="33">Alike they trim , as coxcomb Fancy brings ,</l>
     <l n="34">The rags of beggars , and the robes of kings .</l>
     <l n="35">Let dull Propriety in state preside</l>
     <l n="36">O'er her dull children , Nature is their guide ;</l>
     <l n="37">Wild Nature , who at random breaks the fence</l>
     <l n="38">Of those tame drudges , Judgment , Taste , and Sense ,</l>
     <l n="39">Nor would forgive herself the mighty crime</l>
     <l n="40">Of keeping terms with Person , Place , and Time . 40</l>
     <l n="41">Let liquid gold emblaze the sun at noon ,</l>
     <l n="42">With borrow 'd beams let silver pale the moon ;</l>
     <l n="43">Let surges hoarse lash the resounding shore ,</l>
     <l n="44">Let streams meander , and let torrents roar ;</l>
     <l n="45">Let them breed up the melancholy breeze ,</l>
     <l n="46">To sigh with sighing , sob with sobbing trees ;</l>
     <l n="47">Let vales embroidery wear ; let flowers be tinged</l>
     <l n="48">With various tints ; let clouds be laced or fringed ,</l>
     <l n="49">They have their wish ; like idle monarch boys ,</l>
     <l n="50">Neglecting things of weight , they sigh for toys ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Give them the crown , the sceptre , and the robe ,</l>
     <l n="52">Who will may take the power , and rule the globe .</l>
     <l n="53">Others there are , who , in one solemn pace ,</l>
     <l n="54">With as much zeal as Quakers rail at lace ,</l>
     <l n="55">Railing at needful ornament , depend</l>
     <l n="56">On Sense to bring them to their journey 's end :</l>
     <l n="57">They would not ( Heaven forbid ! ) their course delay ,</l>
     <l n="58">Nor for a moment step out of the way ,</l>
     <l n="59">To make the barren road those graces wear</l>
     <l n="60">Which Nature would , if pleased , have planted there . 60</l>
     <l n="61">Vain men ! who , blindly thwarting Nature 's plan ,</l>
     <l n="62">Ne'er find a passage to the heart of man ;</l>
     <l n="63">Who , bred ‘ mongst fogs in academic land ,</l>
     <l n="64">Scorn every thing they do not understand ;</l>
     <l n="65">Who , destitute of humour , wit , and taste ,</l>
     <l n="66">Let all their little knowledge run to waste ,</l>
     <l n="67">And frustrate each good purpose , whilst they wear</l>
     <l n="68">The robes of Learning with a sloven 's air .</l>
     <l n="69">Though solid reasoning arms each sterling line ,</l>
     <l n="70">Though Truth declares aloud , ‘ This work is mine , ’</l>
     <l n="71">Vice , whilst from page to page dull morals creep , 70</l>
     <l n="72">Throws by the book , and Virtue falls asleep .</l>
     <l n="73">Sense , mere dull , formal Sense , in this gay town ,</l>
     <l n="74">Must have some vehicle to pass her down ;</l>
     <l n="75">Nor can she for an hour insure her reign ,</l>
     <l n="76">Unless she brings fair Pleasure in her train .</l>
     <l n="77">Let her from day to day , from year to year ,</l>
     <l n="78">In all her grave solemnities appear ,</l>
     <l n="79">And with the voice of trumpets , through the streets ,</l>
     <l n="80">Deal lectures out to every one she meets ; 80</l>
     <l n="81">Half who pass by are deaf , and t ’ other half</l>
     <l n="82">Can hear indeed , but only hear to laugh .</l>
     <l n="83">Quit then , ye graver sons of letter 'd Pride !</l>
     <l n="84">Taking for once Experience as a guide ,</l>
     <l n="85">Quit this grand error , this dull college mode ;</l>
     <l n="86">Be your pursuits the same , but change the road ;</l>
     <l n="87">Write , or at least appear to write , with ease ,</l>
     <l n="88">‘ And if you mean to profit , learn to please . ’</l>
     <l n="89">In vain for such mistakes they pardon claim ,</l>
     <l n="90">Because they wield the pen in Virtue 's name : 90</l>
     <l n="91">Thrice sacred is that name , thrice bless 'd the man</l>
     <l n="92">Who thinks , speaks , writes , and lives on such a plan !</l>
     <l n="93">This , in himself , himself of course must bless ,</l>
     <l n="94">But cannot with the world promote success .</l>
     <l n="95">He may be strong , but , with effect to speak ,</l>
     <l n="96">Should recollect his readers may be weak ;</l>
     <l n="97">Plain , rigid truths , which saints with comfort bear ,</l>
     <l n="98">Will make the sinner tremble and despair .</l>
     <l n="99">True Virtue acts from love , and the great end</l>
     <l n="100">At which she nobly aims is to amend . 100</l>
     <l n="101">How then do those mistake who arm her laws</l>
     <l n="102">With rigour not their own , and hurt the cause</l>
     <l n="103">They mean to help , whilst with a zealot rage</l>
     <l n="104">They make that goddess , whom they 'd have engage</l>
     <l n="105">Our dearest love , in hideous terror rise !</l>
     <l n="106">Such may be honest , but they can n't be wise .</l>
     <l n="107">In her own full and perfect blaze of light ,</l>
     <l n="108">Virtue breaks forth too strong for human sight ;</l>
     <l n="109">The dazzled eye , that nice but weaker sense ,</l>
     <l n="110">Shuts herself up in darkness for defence : 110</l>
     <l n="111">But to make strong conviction deeper sink ,</l>
     <l n="112">To make the callous feel , the thoughtless think ,</l>
     <l n="113">Like God , made man , she lays her glory by ,</l>
     <l n="114">And beams mild comfort on the ravish 'd eye :</l>
     <l n="115">In earnest most , when most she seems in jest ,</l>
     <l n="116">She worms into , and winds around , the breast ,</l>
     <l n="117">To conquer Vice , of Vice appears the friend ,</l>
     <l n="118">And seems unlike herself to gain her end .</l>
     <l n="119">The sons of Sin , to while away the time</l>
     <l n="120">Which lingers on their hands , of each black crime 120</l>
     <l n="121">To hush the painful memory , and keep</l>
     <l n="122">The tyrant Conscience in delusive sleep ,</l>
     <l n="123">Read on at random , nor suspect the dart</l>
     <l n="124">Until they find it rooted in their heart .</l>
     <l n="125">‘ Gainst vice they give their vote , nor know at first</l>
     <l n="126">That , cursing that , themselves too they have cursed ;</l>
     <l n="127">They see not , till they fall into the snares ,</l>
     <l n="128">Deluded into virtue unawares .</l>
     <l n="129">Thus the shrewd doctor , in the spleen-struck mind ,</l>
     <l n="130">When pregnant horror sits , and broods o'er wind , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Discarding drugs , and striving how to please ,</l>
     <l n="132">Lures on insensibly , by slow degrees ,</l>
     <l n="133">The patient to those manly sports which bind</l>
     <l n="134">The slacken 'd sinews , and relieve the mind ;</l>
     <l n="135">The patient feels a change as wrought by stealth ,</l>
     <l n="136">And wonders on demand to find it health .</l>
     <l n="137">Some few , whom Fate ordain 'd to deal in rhymes</l>
     <l n="138">In other lands , and here , in other times ,</l>
     <l n="139">Whom , waiting at their birth , the midwife Muse</l>
     <l n="140">Sprinkled all over with Castalian dews , 140</l>
     <l n="141">To whom true Genius gave his magic pen ,</l>
     <l n="142">Whom Art by just degrees led up to men ;</l>
     <l n="143">Some few , extremes well shunn 'd , have steer 'd between</l>
     <l n="144">These dangerous rocks , and held the golden mean ;</l>
     <l n="145">Sense in their works maintains her proper state ,</l>
     <l n="146">But never sleeps , or labours with her weight ;</l>
     <l n="147">Grace makes the whole look elegant and gay ,</l>
     <l n="148">But never dares from Sense to run astray :</l>
     <l n="149">So nice the master 's touch , so great his care ,</l>
     <l n="150">The colours boldly glow , not idly glare ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">Mutually giving and receiving aid ,</l>
     <l n="152">They set each other off , like light and shade ,</l>
     <l n="153">And , as by stealth , with so much softness blend ,</l>
     <l n="154">‘ Tis hard to say where they begin or end :</l>
     <l n="155">Both give us charms , and neither gives offence ;</l>
     <l n="156">Sense perfects Grace , and Grace enlivens Sense .</l>
     <l n="157">Peace to the men who these high honours claim ,</l>
     <l n="158">Health to their souls , and to their memories fame !</l>
     <l n="159">Be it my task , and no mean task , to teach</l>
     <l n="160">A reverence for that worth I cannot reach : 160</l>
     <l n="161">Let me at distance , with a steady eye ,</l>
     <l n="162">Observe and mark their passage to the sky ;</l>
     <l n="163">From envy free , applaud such rising worth ,</l>
     <l n="164">And praise their heaven , though pinion 'd down to earth !</l>
     <l n="165">Had I the power , I could not have the time ,</l>
     <l n="166">Whilst spirits flow , and life is in her prime ,</l>
     <l n="167">Without a sin ‘ gainst Pleasure , to design</l>
     <l n="168">A plan , to methodise each thought , each line</l>
     <l n="169">Highly to finish , and make every grace ,</l>
     <l n="170">In itself charming , take new charms from place . 170</l>
     <l n="171">Nothing of books , and little known of men ,</l>
     <l n="172">When the mad fit comes on , I seize the pen ,</l>
     <l n="173">Rough as they run , the rapid thoughts set down .</l>
     <l n="174">Rough as they run , discharge them on the town .</l>
     <l n="175">Hence rude , unfinish 'd brats , before their time ,</l>
     <l n="176">Are born into this idle world of Rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="177">And the poor slattern Muse is brought to bed</l>
     <l n="178">‘ With all her imperfections on her head . ’</l>
     <l n="179">Some , as no life appears , no pulses play</l>
     <l n="180">Through the dull dubious mass , no breath makes way , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Doubt , greatly doubt , till for a glass they call ,</l>

     <l n="758">To be a common father , to secure</l>
     <l n="759">The weak from violence , from pride the poor ; 80</l>
     <l n="760">Vice and her sons to banish in disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="761">To make Corruption dread to show her face ;</l>

     <l n="814">When the dews fall , and when the sun retires</l>

     <l n="1046">Fair though thou art , and lovely to mine eye ,</l>
     <l n="1047">Though full rewards in thy possession lie</l>
     <l n="1048">To crown man 's wish , and do thy favourites grace ;</l>
     <l n="1049">Though ( was I station 'd in an humbler place ) 370</l>
     <l n="1050">I could be ever happy in thy sight ,</l>
     <l n="1051">Toil with thee all the day , and through the night ,</l>
     <l n="1052">Toil on from watch to watch , bidding my eye ,</l>
     <l n="1053">Fast rivetted on Science , sleep defy ;</l>
     <l n="1054">Yet ( such the hardships which from empire flow )</l>
     <l n="1055">Must I thy sweet society forego ,</l>
     <l n="1056">And to some happy rival 's arms resign</l>
     <l n="1057">Those charms which can , alas ! no more be mine !</l>
     <l n="1058">No more from hour to hour , from day to day ,</l>
     <l n="1059">Shall I pursue thy steps , and urge my way 380</l>
     <l n="1060">Where eager love of science calls ; no more</l>
     <l n="1061">Attempt those paths which man ne'er trod before ;</l>
     <l n="1062">No more , the mountain scaled , the desert cross 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1063">Losing myself , nor knowing I was lost ,</l>
     <l n="1064">Travel through woods , through wilds , from morn to night ,</l>
     <l n="1065">From night to morn , yet travel with delight ,</l>
     <l n="1066">And having found thee , lay me down content ,</l>
     <l n="1067">Own all my toil well paid , my time well spent .</l>
     <l n="1068">Farewell , ye Muses too !— for such mean things</l>
     <l n="1069">Must not presume to dwell with mighty kings — 390</l>
     <l n="1070">Farewell , ye Muses ! though it cuts my heart</l>
     <l n="1071">E'en to the quick , we must for ever part .</l>
     <l n="1072">When the fresh morn bade lusty Nature wake ;</l>
     <l n="1073">When the birds , sweetly twittering through the brake ,</l>
     <l n="1074">Tune their soft pipes ; when , from the neighbouring bloom</l>
     <l n="1075">Sipping the dew , each zephyr stole perfume ;</l>
     <l n="1076">When all things with new vigour were inspired ,</l>
     <l n="1077">And seem 'd to say they never could be tired ;</l>
     <l n="1078">How often have we stray 'd , whilst sportive rhyme</l>
     <l n="1079">Deceived the way and clipp 'd the wings of Time , 400</l>
     <l n="1080">O'er hill , o'er dale ; how often laugh 'd to see ,</l>
     <l n="1081">Yourselves made visible to none but me ,</l>
     <l n="1082">The clown , his works suspended , gape and stare ,</l>
     <l n="1083">And seem to think that I conversed with air !</l>
     <l n="1084">When the sun , beating on the parched soil ,</l>
     <l n="1085">Seem 'd to proclaim an interval of toil ;</l>
     <l n="1086">When a faint langour crept through every breast ,</l>
     <l n="1087">And things most used to labour wish 'd for rest ,</l>
     <l n="1088">How often , underneath a reverend oak ,</l>
     <l n="1089">Where safe , and fearless of the impious stroke , 410</l>
     <l n="1090">Some sacred Dryad lived ; or in some grove ,</l>
     <l n="1091">Where , with capricious fingers , Fancy wove</l>
     <l n="1092">Her fairy bower , whilst Nature all the while</l>
     <l n="1093">Look 'd on , and view 'd her mockeries with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="1094">Have we held converse sweet ! How often laid ,</l>
     <l n="1095">Fast by the Thames , in Ham 's inspiring shade ,</l>
     <l n="1096">Amongst those poets which make up your train ,</l>
     <l n="1097">And , after death , pour forth the sacred strain ,</l>
     <l n="1098">Have I , at your command , in verse grown gray ,</l>
     <l n="1099">But not impair 'd , heard Dryden tune that lay 420</l>
     <l n="1100">Which might have drawn an angel from his sphere ,</l>
     <l n="1101">And kept him from his office listening here !</l>
     <l n="1102">When dreary Night , with Morpheus in her train ,</l>
     <l n="1103">Led on by Silence to resume her reign ,</l>
     <l n="1104">With darkness covering , as with a robe ,</l>
     <l n="1105">The scene of levity , blank 'd half the globe ;</l>
     <l n="1106">How oft , enchanted with your heavenly strains ,</l>
     <l n="1107">Which stole me from myself ; which in soft chains</l>
     <l n="1108">Of music bound my soul ; how oft have I ,</l>
     <l n="1109">Sounds more than human floating through the sky , 430</l>
     <l n="1110">Attentive sat , whilst Night , against her will ,</l>
     <l n="1111">Transported with the harmony , stood still !</l>
     <l n="1112">How oft in raptures , which man scarce could bear ,</l>
     <l n="1113">Have I , when gone , still thought the Muses there ;</l>
     <l n="1114">Still heard their music , and , as mute as death ,</l>
     <l n="1115">Sat all attention , drew in every breath ,</l>
     <l n="1116">Lest , breathing all too rudely , I should wound ,</l>
     <l n="1117">And mar that magic excellence of sound ;</l>
     <l n="1118">Then , Sense returning with return of day ,</l>
     <l n="1119">Have chid the Night , which fled so fast away ! 440</l>
     <l n="1120">Such my pursuits , and such my joys of yore ,</l>
     <l n="1121">Such were my mates , but now my mates no more .</l>
     <l n="1122">Placed out of Envy 's walk , ( for Envy , sure ,</l>
     <l n="1123">Would never haunt the cottage of the poor ,</l>
     <l n="1124">Would never stoop to wound my homespun lays )</l>
     <l n="1125">With some few friends , and some small share of praise ,</l>
     <l n="1126">Beneath oppression , undisturb 'd by strife ,</l>
     <l n="1127">In peace I trod the humble vale of life .</l>
     <l n="1128">Farewell , these scenes of ease , this tranquil state ;</l>
     <l n="1129">Welcome the troubles which on empire wait ! 450</l>
     <l n="1130">Light toys from this day forth I disavow ;</l>
     <l n="1131">They pleased me once , but cannot suit me now :</l>
     <l n="1132">To common men all common things are free ,</l>
     <l n="1133">What honours them , might fix disgrace on me .</l>
     <l n="1134">Call 'd to a throne , and o'er a mighty land</l>
     <l n="1135">Ordain 'd to rule , my head , my heart , my hand ,</l>
     <l n="1136">Are all engross 'd ; each private view withstood ,</l>
     <l n="1137">And task 'd to labour for the public good :</l>
     <l n="1138">Be this my study ; to this one great end</l>
     <l n="1139">May every thought , may every action tend ! 460</l>
     <l n="1140">Let me the page of History turn o'er ,</l>
     <l n="1141">The instructive page , and needfully explore</l>
     <l n="1142">What faithful pens of former times have wrote</l>
     <l n="1143">Of former kings ; what they did worthy note ,</l>
     <l n="1144">What worthy blame ; and from the sacred tomb</l>
     <l n="1145">Where righteous monarchs sleep , where laurels bloom ,</l>
     <l n="1146">Unhurt by Time , let me a garland twine ,</l>
     <l n="1147">Which , robbing not their fame , may add to mine .</l>
     <l n="1148">Nor let me with a vain and idle eye</l>
     <l n="1149">Glance o'er those scenes , and in a hurry fly , 470</l>
     <l n="1150">Quick as the post , which travels day and night ;</l>
     <l n="1151">Nor let me dwell there , lured by false delight ;</l>
     <l n="1152">And , into barren theory betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1153">Forget that monarchs are for action made .</l>
     <l n="1154">When amorous Spring , repairing all his charms ,</l>
     <l n="1155">Calls Nature forth from hoary Winter 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="1156">Where , like a virgin to some lecher sold ,</l>
     <l n="1157">Three wretched months she lay benumb 'd , and cold ;</l>
     <l n="1158">When the weak flower , which , shrinking from the breath</l>
     <l n="1159">Of the rude North , and timorous of death , 480</l>
     <l n="1160">To its kind mother earth for shelter fled ,</l>
     <l n="1161">And on her bosom hid its tender head ,</l>
     <l n="1162">Peeps forth afresh , and , cheer 'd by milder sties ,</l>
     <l n="1163">Bids in full splendour all her beauties rise ;</l>
     <l n="1164">The hive is up in arms — expert to teach ,</l>
     <l n="1165">Nor , proudly , to be taught unwilling , each</l>
     <l n="1166">Seems from her fellow a new zeal to catch ;</l>
     <l n="1167">Strength in her limbs , and on her wings dispatch ,</l>
     <l n="1168">The bee goes forth ; from herb to herb she flies ,</l>
     <l n="1169">From flower to flower , and loads her labouring thighs 490</l>
     <l n="1170">With treasured sweets , robbing those flowers , which , left ,</l>
     <l n="1171">Find not themselves made poorer by the theft ,</l>
     <l n="1172">Their scents as lively , and their looks as fair ,</l>
     <l n="1173">As if the pillager had not been there .</l>
     <l n="1174">Ne'er doth she flit on Pleasure 's silken wing ;</l>
     <l n="1175">Ne'er doth she , loitering , let the bloom of Spring</l>
     <l n="1176">Unrifled pass , and on the downy breast</l>
     <l n="1177">Of some fair flower indulge untimely rest ;</l>
     <l n="1178">Ne'er doth she , drinking deep of those rich dews</l>
     <l n="1179">Which chemist Night prepared , that faith abuse 500</l>
     <l n="1180">Due to the hive , and , selfish in her toils ,</l>
     <l n="1181">To her own private use convert the spoils .</l>
     <l n="1182">Love of the stock first call 'd her forth to roam ,</l>
     <l n="1183">And to the stock she brings her booty home .</l>
     <l n="1184">Be this my pattern — as becomes a king ,</l>
     <l n="1185">Let me fly all abroad on Reason 's wing ;</l>
     <l n="1186">Let mine eye , like the lightning , through the earth</l>
     <l n="1187">Run to and fro , nor let one deed of worth ,</l>
     <l n="1188">In any place and time , nor let one man ,</l>
     <l n="1189">Whose actions may enrich dominion 's plan , 510</l>
     <l n="1190">Escape my note ; be all , from the first day</l>
     <l n="1191">Of Nature to this hour , be all my prey .</l>
     <l n="1192">From those whom Time , at the desire of Fame ,</l>
     <l n="1193">Hath spared , let Virtue catch an equal flame ;</l>
     <l n="1194">From those who , not in mercy , but in rage ,</l>
     <l n="1195">Time hath reprieved , to damn from age to age ,</l>
     <l n="1196">Let me take warning , lesson 'd to distil ,</l>
     <l n="1197">And , imitating Heaven , draw good from ill .</l>
     <l n="1198">Nor let these great researches , in my breast</l>
     <l n="1199">A monument of useless labour rest ; 520</l>
     <l n="1200">No — let them spread — the effects let Gotham share ,</l>
     <l n="1201">And reap the harvest of their monarch 's care :</l>
     <l n="1202">Be other times , and other countries known ,</l>
     <l n="1203">Only to give fresh blessings to my own .</l>
     <l n="1204">Let me , ( and may that God to whom I fly ,</l>
     <l n="1205">On whom for needful succour I rely</l>
     <l n="1206">In this great hour , that glorious God of truth ,</l>
     <l n="1207">Through whom I reign , in mercy to my youth ,</l>
     <l n="1208">Assist my weakness , and direct me right ;</l>
     <l n="1209">From every speck which hangs upon the sight 530</l>
     <l n="1210">Purge my mind 's eye , nor let one cloud remain</l>
     <l n="1211">To spread the shades of Error o'er my brain ! )</l>
     <l n="1212">Let me , impartial , with unwearied thought ,</l>
     <l n="1213">Try men and things ; let me , as monarchs ought ,</l>
     <l n="1214">Examine well on what my power depends ;</l>
     <l n="1215">What are the general principles and ends</l>
     <l n="1216">Of government ; how empire first began ;</l>
     <l n="1217">And wherefore man was raised to reign o'er man .</l>
     <l n="1218">Let me consider , as from one great source</l>
     <l n="1219">We see a thousand rivers take their course , 540</l>
     <l n="1220">Dispersed , and into different channels led ,</l>
     <l n="1221">Yet by their parent still supplied and fed ,</l>
     <l n="1222">That Government , ( though branch 'd out far and wide ,</l>
     <l n="1223">In various modes to various lands applied )</l>
     <l n="1224">Howe'er it differs in its outward frame ,</l>
     <l n="1225">In the main groundwork 's every where the same ;</l>
     <l n="1226">The same her view , though different her plan ,</l>
     <l n="1227">Her grand and general view — the good of man .</l>
     <l n="1228">Let me find out , by Reason 's sacred beams ,</l>
     <l n="1229">What system in itself most perfect seems , 550</l>
     <l n="1230">Most worthy man , most likely to conduce</l>
     <l n="1231">To all the purposes of general use ;</l>
     <l n="1232">Let me find , too , where , by fair Reason tried ,</l>
     <l n="1233">It fails , when to particulars applied ;</l>
     <l n="1234">Why in that mode all nations do not join ,</l>
     <l n="1235">And , chiefly , why it cannot suit with mine .</l>
     <l n="1236">Let me the gradual rise of empires trace ,</l>
     <l n="1237">Till they seem founded on Perfection 's base ;</l>
     <l n="1238">Then ( for when human things have made their way</l>
     <l n="1239">To excellence , they hasten to decay ) 560</l>
     <l n="1240">Let me , whilst Observation lends her clue</l>
     <l n="1241">Step after step to their decline pursue ,</l>
     <l n="1242">Enabled by a chain of facts to tell</l>
     <l n="1243">Not only how they rose , but why they fell .</l>
     <l n="1244">Let me not only the distempers know</l>
     <l n="1245">Which in all states from common causes grow ,</l>
     <l n="1246">But likewise those , which , by the will of Fate ,</l>
     <l n="1247">On each peculiar mode of empire wait ;</l>
     <l n="1248">Which in its very constitution lurk ,</l>
     <l n="1249">Too sure at last to do its destined work : 570</l>
     <l n="1250">Let me , forewarn 'd , each sign , each symptom learn ,</l>
     <l n="1251">That I my people 's danger may discern ,</l>
     <l n="1252">Ere ‘ tis too late wish 'd health to reassure ,</l>
     <l n="1253">And , if it can be found , find out a cure .</l>
     <l n="1254">Let me , ( though great , grave brethren of the gown</l>
     <l n="1255">Preach all Faith up , and preach all Reason down ,</l>
     <l n="1256">Making those jar whom Reason meant to join ,</l>
     <l n="1257">And vesting in themselves a right divine ) ,</l>
     <l n="1258">Let me , through Reason 's glass , with searching eye ,</l>
     <l n="1259">Into the depth of that religion pry 580</l>
     <l n="1260">Which law hath sanction 'd ; let me find out there</l>
     <l n="1261">What 's form , what 's essence ; what , like vagrant air ,</l>
     <l n="1262">We well may change ; and what , without a crime ,</l>
     <l n="1263">Cannot be changed to the last hour of time .</l>
     <l n="1264">Nor let me suffer that outrageous zeal</l>
     <l n="1265">Which , without knowledge , furious bigots feel ,</l>
     <l n="1266">Fair in pretence , though at the heart unsound ,</l>
     <l n="1267">These separate points at random to confound .</l>
     <l n="1268">The times have been when priests have dared to tread ,</l>
     <l n="1269">Proud and insulting , on their monarch 's head ; 590</l>
     <l n="1270">When , whilst they made religion a pretence ,</l>
     <l n="1271">Out of the world they banish 'd common-sense ;</l>
     <l n="1272">When some soft king , too open to deceit ,</l>
     <l n="1273">Easy and unsuspecting join 'd the cheat ,</l>
     <l n="1274">Duped by mock piety , and gave his name</l>
     <l n="1275">To serve the vilest purposes of shame .</l>
     <l n="1276">Pear not , my people ! where no cause of fear</l>
     <l n="1277">Can justly rise — your king secures you here ;</l>
     <l n="1278">Your king , who scorns the haughty prelate 's nod ,</l>
     <l n="1279">Nor deems the voice of priests the voice of God . 600</l>
     <l n="1280">Let me , ( though lawyers may perhaps forbid</l>
     <l n="1281">Their monarch to behold what they wish hid ,</l>
     <l n="1282">And for the purposes of knavish gain ,</l>
     <l n="1283">Would have their trade a mystery remain )</l>
     <l n="1284">Let me , disdaining all such slavish awe ,</l>
     <l n="1285">Dive to the very bottom of the law ;</l>
     <l n="1286">Let me ( the weak , dead letter left behind )</l>
     <l n="1287">Search out the principles , the spirit find ,</l>
     <l n="1288">Till , from the parts , made master of the whole ,</l>
     <l n="1289">I see the Constitution 's very soul . 610</l>
     <l n="1290">Let me , ( though statesmen will no doubt resist ,</l>

     <l n="1298">Unravel all low ministerial scenes ,</l>
     <l n="1299">Destroy their jobs , lay bare their ways and means , 620</l>
     <l n="1300">And track them step by step ; let me well know</l>
     <l n="1301">How places , pensions , and preferments go ;</l>
     <l n="1302">Why Guilt 's provided for when Worth is not ,</l>
     <l n="1303">And why one man of merit is forgot ;</l>
     <l n="1304">Let me in peace , in war , supreme preside ,</l>

     <l n="1306">Let me , ( though Dignity , by nature proud ,</l>

     <l n="1308">As if the sun shone with less powerful ray ,</l>
     <l n="1309">Less grace , less glory , shining every day ,— 630</l>
     <l n="1310">Though when she comes forth into public sight ,</l>

     <l n="1318">All ornament , and needless helps of art ,</l>
     <l n="1319">All those big looks , which speak a little heart ) 640</l>
     <l n="1320">Know ( which few kings , alas ! have ever known )</l>
     <l n="1321">How Affability becomes a throne ,</l>
     <l n="1322">Destroys all fear , bids Love with Reverence live ,</l>
     <l n="1323">And gives those graces Pride can never give .</l>
     <l n="1324">Let the stern tyrant keep a distant state ,</l>

     <l n="218">Short is her life , and impotent her sting ;</l>

     <l n="227">Sandwich , who , from the moment of his birth ,</l>
     <l n="228">Made human nature a reproach on earth ,</l>
     <l n="229">Who never dared , nor wish 'd , behind to stay ,</l>
     <l n="230">When Folly , Vice , and Meanness led the way , 230</l>

     <l n="236">Turning the brain , bears Reason from her course ;</l>
     <l n="237">Carries me back to times , when poets , bless 'd</l>

     <l n="242">The foes of freedom they to justice brought ,</l>

     <l n="245">Ah ! what are poets now ? As slavish those</l>
     <l n="246">Who deal in verse , as those who deal in prose .</l>
     <l n="247">Is there an Author , search the kingdom round ,</l>
     <l n="248">In whom true worth and real spirit 's found ?</l>
     <l n="249">The slaves of booksellers , or ( doom 'd by Fate</l>

     <l n="280">And damn his own good name , to rescue thine . 280</l>
     <l n="281">But , if thy niggard hands their gifts withhold ,</l>

     <l n="283">Expect no mercy ; facts , well-grounded , teach ,</l>
     <l n="284">Murphy , if not rewarded , will impeach .</l>
     <l n="285">What though each man of nice and juster thought ,</l>

     <l n="3">The servants gone to break the scurvy jest</l>

     <l n="8">With an insipid kind of stupid stare ,</l>
     <l n="9">Picking his teeth , twirling his seals about —</l>
     <l n="10">Churchill , you have a poem coming out : 10</l>
     <l n="11">You 've my best wishes ; but I really fear</l>
     <l n="12">Your Muse , in general , is too severe ;</l>
     <l n="13">Her spirit seems her interest to oppose ,</l>
     <l n="14">And where she makes one friend , makes twenty foes .</l>
     <l n="15">C. Your lordship 's fears are just ; I feel their force ,</l>
     <l n="16">But only feel it as a thing of course .</l>
     <l n="17">The man whose hardy spirit shall engage</l>
     <l n="18">To lash , the vices of a guilty age ,</l>
     <l n="19">At his first setting forward ought to know</l>
     <l n="20">That every rogue he meets must be his foe ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">That the rude breath of satire will provoke</l>
     <l n="22">Many who feel , and more who fear the stroke .</l>
     <l n="23">But shall the partial rage of selfish men</l>
     <l n="24">From stubborn Justice wrench the righteous pen ?</l>
     <l n="25">Or shall I not my settled course pursue ,</l>
     <l n="26">Because my foes are foes to Virtue too ?</l>
     <l n="27">L. What is this boasted Virtue , taught in schools ,</l>
     <l n="28">And idly drawn from antiquated rules ?</l>
     <l n="29">What is her use ? Point out one wholesome end .</l>
     <l n="30">Will she hurt foes , or can she make a friend ? 30</l>
     <l n="31">When from long fasts fierce appetites arise ,</l>
     <l n="32">Can this same Virtue stifle Nature 's cries ?</l>
     <l n="33">Can she the pittance of a meal afford ,</l>
     <l n="34">Or bid thee welcome to one great man 's board ?</l>
     <l n="35">When northern winds the rough December arm</l>
     <l n="36">With frost and snow , can Virtue keep thee warm ?</l>
     <l n="37">Canst thou dismiss the hard unfeeling dun</l>
     <l n="38">Barely by saying , thou art Virtue 's son ?</l>
     <l n="39">Or by base blundering statesmen sent to jail ,</l>
     <l n="40">Will Mansfield take this Virtue for thy bail ? 40</l>
     <l n="41">Believe it not , the name is in disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="42">Virtue and Temple now are out of place .</l>
     <l n="43">Quit then this meteor , whose delusive ray</l>
     <l n="44">Prom wealth and honour leads thee far astray .</l>
     <l n="45">True virtue means — let Reason use her eyes —</l>
     <l n="46">Nothing with fools , and interest with the wise .</l>
     <l n="47">Wouldst thou be great , her patronage disclaim ,</l>
     <l n="48">Nor madly triumph in so mean a name :</l>
     <l n="49">Let nobler wreaths thy happy brows adorn ,</l>
     <l n="50">And leave to Virtue poverty and scorn . 50</l>
     <l n="51">Let Prudence be thy guide ; who doth not know</l>
     <l n="52">How seldom Prudence can with Virtue go ?</l>
     <l n="53">To be successful try thy utmost force ,</l>
     <l n="54">And Virtue follows as a thing of course .</l>
     <l n="55">Hirco — who knows not Hirco ?— stains the bed</l>
     <l n="56">Of that kind master who first gave him bread ;</l>
     <l n="57">Scatters the seeds of discord through the land ,</l>
     <l n="58">Breaks every public , every private band ;</l>
     <l n="59">Beholds with joy a trusting friend undone ;</l>
     <l n="60">Betrays a brother , and would cheat a son : 60</l>
     <l n="61">What mortal in his senses can endure</l>
     <l n="62">The name of Hirco ? for the wretch is poor !</l>
     <l n="63">Let him hang , drown , starve , on a dunghill rot ,</l>
     <l n="64">By all detested live , and die forgot ;</l>
     <l n="65">Let him — a poor return — in every breath</l>
     <l n="66">Feel all Death 's pains , yet be whole years in death ,</l>
     <l n="67">Is now the general cry we all pursue .</l>
     <l n="68">Let Fortune change , and Prudence changes too ;</l>
     <l n="69">Supple and pliant , a new system feels ,</l>
     <l n="70">Throws up her cap , and spaniels at his heels : 70</l>
     <l n="71">Long live great Hirco , cries , by interest taught ,</l>
     <l n="72">And let his foes , though I prove one , be nought .</l>
     <l n="73">C. Peace to such men , if such men can have peace ;</l>
     <l n="74">Let their possessions , let their state increase ;</l>
     <l n="75">Let their base services in courts strike root ,</l>
     <l n="76">And in the season bring forth golden fruit .</l>
     <l n="77">I envy not ; let those who have the will ,</l>
     <l n="78">And , with so little spirit , so much skill ,</l>
     <l n="79">With such vile instruments their fortunes carve ;</l>
     <l n="80">Rogues may grow fat , an honest man dares starve .<span type="note_anchor">[ 183 ]</span>80</l>
     <l n="81">L. These stale conceits thrown off , let us advance</l>

     <l n="1">A sacred standard rule we find ,</l>

     <l n="5">This custom , through a bigot zeal ,</l>

     <l n="11">Yielding to Time 's destructive course ,</l>
     <l n="12">For ages past hath lost its force .</l>
     <l n="13">With ancient bards , an invocation</l>
     <l n="14">Was a true act of adoration ,</l>
     <l n="15">Of worship an essential part ,</l>
     <l n="16">And not a formal piece of art ,</l>
     <l n="17">Of paltry reading a parade ,</l>
     <l n="18">A dull solemnity in trade ,</l>

     <l n="769">How would fools laugh , should it appear</l>

    <head>BOOK III .</head>
     <l n="1">It was the hour , when housewife Morn</l>
     <l n="2">With pearl and linen hangs each thorn ;</l>
     <l n="3">When happy bards , who can regale</l>
     <l n="4">Their Muse with country air and ale ,</l>
     <l n="5">Ramble afield to brooks and bowers ,</l>
     <l n="6">To pick up sentiments and flowers ;</l>
     <l n="7">When dogs and squires from kennel fly ,</l>
     <l n="8">And hogs and farmers quit their sty ;</l>
     <l n="9">When my lord rises to the chase ,</l>
     <l n="10">And brawny chaplain takes his place . 10</l>
     <l n="11">These images , or bad , or good ,</l>
     <l n="12">If they are rightly understood ,</l>
     <l n="13">Sagacious readers must allow</l>
     <l n="14">Proclaim us in the country now ;</l>
     <l n="15">For observations mostly rise</l>
     <l n="16">From objects just before our eyes ,</l>
     <l n="17">And every lord , in critic wit ,</l>
     <l n="18">Can tell you where the piece was writ ;</l>
     <l n="19">Can point out , as he goes along ,</l>
     <l n="20">( And who shall dare to say he 's wrong ? ) 20</l>
     <l n="21">Whether the warmth ( for bards , we know ,</l>
     <l n="22">At present never more than glow )</l>
     <l n="23">Was in the town or country caught ,</l>
     <l n="24">By the peculiar turn of thought .</l>
     <l n="25">It was the hour ,— though critics frown ,</l>
     <l n="26">We now declare ourselves in Town ,</l>
     <l n="27">Nor will a moment 's pause allow</l>
     <l n="28">For finding when we came , or how .</l>
     <l n="29">The man who deals in humble prose ,</l>
     <l n="30">Tied down by rule and method goes ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">But they who court the vigorous Muse</l>
     <l n="32">Their carriage have a right to choose .</l>
     <l n="33">Free as the air , and unconfined ,</l>
     <l n="34">Swift as the motions of the mind ,</l>
     <l n="35">The poet darts from place to place ,</l>
     <l n="36">And instant bounds o'er time and space :</l>
     <l n="37">Nature ( whilst blended fire and skill</l>
     <l n="38">Inflame our passions to his will )</l>
     <l n="39">Smiles at her violated laws ,</l>
     <l n="40">And crowns his daring with applause . 40</l>
     <l n="41">Should there be still some rigid few ,</l>
     <l n="42">Who keep propriety in view ,</l>
     <l n="43">Whose heads turn round , and cannot bear</l>
     <l n="44">This whirling passage through the air ,</l>
     <l n="45">Free leave have such at home to sit ,</l>
     <l n="46">And write a regimen for wit ;</l>
     <l n="47">To clip our pinions let them try ,</l>
     <l n="48">Not having heart themselves to fly .</l>
     <l n="49">It was the hour when devotees</l>
     <l n="50">Breathe pious curses on their knees ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">When they with prayers the day begin</l>
     <l n="52">To sanctify a night of sin ;</l>
     <l n="53">When rogues of modesty , who roam</l>
     <l n="54">Under the veil of night , sneak home ,</l>
     <l n="55">That , free from all restraint and awe ,</l>
     <l n="56">Just to the windward of the law ,</l>
     <l n="57">Less modest rogues their tricks may play ,</l>
     <l n="58">And plunder in the face of day .</l>
     <l n="59">But hold ,— whilst thus we play the fool ,</l>
     <l n="60">In bold contempt of every rule , 60</l>
     <l n="61">Things of no consequence expressing ,</l>
     <l n="62">Describing now , and now digressing ,</l>
     <l n="63">To the discredit of our skill ,</l>
     <l n="64">The main concern is standing still .</l>
     <l n="65">In plays , indeed , when storms of rage</l>
     <l n="66">Tempestuous in the soul engage ,</l>
     <l n="67">Or when the spirits , weak and low ,</l>
     <l n="68">Are sunk in deep distress and woe ,</l>
     <l n="69">With strict propriety we hear</l>
     <l n="70">Description stealing on the ear , 70</l>
     <l n="71">And put off feeling half an hour</l>
     <l n="72">To thatch a cot , or paint a flower ;</l>
     <l n="73">But in these serious works , design 'd</l>
     <l n="74">To mend the morals of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="75">We must for ever be disgraced</l>
     <l n="76">With all the nicer sons of Taste ,</l>
     <l n="77">If once , the shadow to pursue ,</l>
     <l n="78">We let the substance out of view .</l>
     <l n="79">Our means must uniformly tend</l>
     <l n="80">In due proportion to their end , 80</l>
     <l n="81">And every passage aptly join</l>
     <l n="82">To bring about the one design .</l>
     <l n="83">Our friends themselves cannot admit</l>
     <l n="84">This rambling , wild , digressive wit ;</l>
     <l n="85">No — not those very friends , who found</l>
     <l n="86">Their credit on the self-same ground .</l>
     <l n="87">Peace , my good grumbling sir — for once ,</l>
     <l n="88">Sunk in the solemn , formal dunce ,</l>
     <l n="89">This coxcomb shall your fears beguile —</l>
     <l n="90">We will be dull — that you may smile . 90</l>
     <l n="91">Come , Method , come in all thy pride ,</l>
     <l n="92">Dulness and Whitehead by thy side ;</l>
     <l n="93">Dulness and Method still are one ,</l>
     <l n="94">And Whitehead is their darling son :</l>
     <l n="95">Not he<span type="note_anchor">[ 215 ]</span>, whose pen , above control ,</l>
     <l n="96">Struck terror to the guilty soul ,</l>
     <l n="97">Made Folly tremble through her state ,</l>
     <l n="98">And villains blush at being great ;</l>
     <l n="99">Whilst he himself , with steady face ,</l>
     <l n="100">Disdaining modesty and grace , 100</l>
     <l n="101">Could blunder on through thick and thin ,</l>
     <l n="102">Through every mean and servile sin ,</l>
     <l n="103">Yet swear by Philip and by Paul ,</l>
     <l n="104">He nobly scorn 'd to blush at all ;</l>

     <l n="106">By grace , not merit , planted there ,</l>
     <l n="107">In awkward pomp is seen to sit ,</l>
     <l n="108">And by his patent proves his wit ;</l>
     <l n="109">For favours of the great , we know ,</l>
     <l n="110">Can wit as well as rank bestow ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">And they who , without one pretension ,</l>
     <l n="112">Can get for fools a place or pension ,</l>
     <l n="113">Must able be supposed , of course ,</l>
     <l n="114">( If reason is allow 'd due force )</l>
     <l n="115">To give such qualities and grace</l>
     <l n="116">As may equip them for the place .</l>
     <l n="117">But he — who measures as he goes</l>
     <l n="118">A mongrel kind of tinkling prose ,</l>
     <l n="119">And is too frugal to dispense ,</l>
     <l n="120">At once , both poetry and sense ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">Who , from amidst his slumbering guards ,</l>
     <l n="122">Deals out a charge to subject bards ,</l>
     <l n="123">Where couplets after couplets creep</l>
     <l n="124">Propitious to the reign of sleep ;</l>
     <l n="125">Yet every word imprints an awe ,</l>
     <l n="126">And all his dictates pass for law</l>
     <l n="127">With beaux , who simper all around ,</l>
     <l n="128">And belles , who die ill every sound :</l>
     <l n="129">For in all things of this relation ,</l>
     <l n="130">Men mostly judge from situation , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Nor in a thousand find we one</l>
     <l n="132">Who really weighs what 's said or done ;</l>
     <l n="133">They deal out censure , or give credit ,</l>
     <l n="134">Merely from him who did or said it .</l>
     <l n="135">But he — who , happily serene ,</l>
     <l n="136">Means nothing , yet would seem to mean ;</l>
     <l n="137">Who rules and cautions can dispense</l>
     <l n="138">With all that humble insolence</l>
     <l n="139">Which Impudence in vain would teach ,</l>
     <l n="140">And none but modest men can reach ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Who adds to sentiments the grace</l>
     <l n="142">Of always being out of place ,</l>
     <l n="143">And drawls out morals with an air</l>
     <l n="144">A gentleman would blush to wear ;</l>

     <l n="782">What is the first , may be the last ,</l>
     <l n="783">Which is a point , all must agree ,</l>
     <l n="784">Cannot depend on you or me .</l>
     <l n="785">Fanny , no ghost of common mould ,</l>
     <l n="786">Is not by forms to be controll 'd ;</l>
     <l n="787">To keep her state , and show her skill ,</l>
     <l n="788">She never comes but when she will .</l>
     <l n="789">I wrote and wrote , ( perhaps you doubt ,</l>
     <l n="790">And shrewdly , what I wrote about ; 790</l>
     <l n="791">Believe me , much to my disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="792">I , too , am in the self-same case ;)</l>
     <l n="793">But still I wrote , till Fanny came</l>
     <l n="794">Impatient , nor could any shame</l>
     <l n="795">On me with equal justice fall</l>
     <l n="796">If she had never come at all .</l>
     <l n="797">An underling , I could not stir</l>
     <l n="798">Without the cue thrown out by her ,</l>
     <l n="799">Nor from the subject aid receive</l>
     <l n="800">Until she came and gave me leave . 800</l>
     <l n="801">So that , ( ye sons of Erudition</l>
     <l n="802">Mark , this is but a supposition ,</l>
     <l n="803">Nor would I to so wise a nation</l>
     <l n="804">Suggest it as a revelation )</l>
     <l n="805">If henceforth , dully turning o'er</l>
     <l n="806">Page after page , ye read no more</l>
     <l n="807">Of Fanny , who , in sea or air ,</l>
     <l n="808">May be departed God knows where ,</l>
     <l n="809">Rail at jilt Fortune ; but agree</l>
     <l n="810">No censure can be laid on me ; 810</l>
     <l n="811">For sure ( the cause let Mansfield try )</l>
     <l n="812">Fanny is in the fault , not I .</l>
     <l n="813">But , to return — and this I hold</l>
     <l n="814">A secret worth its weight in gold</l>
     <l n="815">To those who write , as I write now ,</l>
     <l n="816">Not to mind where they go , or how ,</l>
     <l n="817">Through ditch , through bog , o'er hedge and stile ,</l>
     <l n="818">Make it but worth the reader 's while ,</l>
     <l n="819">And keep a passage fair and plain</l>
     <l n="820">Always to bring him back again . 820</l>
     <l n="821">Through dirt , who scruples to approach ,</l>
     <l n="822">At Pleasure 's call , to take a coach ?</l>
     <l n="823">But we should think the man a clown ,</l>
     <l n="824">Who in the dirt should set us down .</l>
     <l n="825">But to return — if Wit , who ne'er</l>
     <l n="826">The shackles of restraint could bear ,</l>
     <l n="827">In wayward humour should refuse</l>
     <l n="828">Her timely succour to the Muse ,</l>
     <l n="829">And , to no rules and orders tied ,</l>
     <l n="830">Roughly deny to be her guide , 830</l>
     <l n="831">She must renounce Decorum 's plan ,</l>
     <l n="832">And get back when , and how she can ;</l>
     <l n="833">As parsons , who , without pretext ,</l>
     <l n="834">As soon as mention 'd , quit their text ,</l>
     <l n="835">And , to promote sleep 's genial power ,</l>
     <l n="836">Grope in the dark for half an hour ,</l>
     <l n="837">Give no more reason ( for we know</l>
     <l n="838">Reason is vulgar , mean , and low )</l>
     <l n="839">Why they come back ( should it befall</l>
     <l n="840">That ever they come back at all ) 840</l>
     <l n="841">Into the road , to end their rout ,</l>
     <l n="842">Than they can give why they went out .</l>
     <l n="843">But to return — this book — the Ghost —</l>
     <l n="844">A mere amusement at the most ;</l>
     <l n="845">A trifle , fit to wear away</l>
     <l n="846">The horrors of a rainy day ;</l>
     <l n="847">A slight shot-silk , for summer wear ,</l>
     <l n="848">Just as our modern statesmen are ,</l>
     <l n="849">If rigid honesty permit</l>
     <l n="850">That I for once purloin the wit 850</l>
     <l n="851">Of him , who , were we all to steal ,</l>
     <l n="852">Is much too rich the theft to feel :</l>
     <l n="853">Yet in this book , where Base should join</l>
     <l n="854">With Mirth to sugar every line ;</l>
     <l n="855">Where it should all be mere chit-chat ,</l>
     <l n="856">Lively , good-humour 'd , and all that ;</l>
     <l n="857">Where honest Satire , in disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="858">Should not so much as show her face ,</l>
     <l n="859">The shrew , o'erleaping all due bounds ,</l>
     <l n="860">Breaks into Laughter 's sacred grounds , 860</l>
     <l n="861">And , in contempt , plays o'er her tricks</l>
     <l n="862">In science , trade , and politics .</l>
     <l n="863">By why should the distemper 'd scold</l>
     <l n="864">Attempt to blacken men enroll 'd</l>
     <l n="865">In Power 's dread book , whose mighty skill</l>
     <l n="866">Can twist an empire to their will ;</l>
     <l n="867">Whose voice is fate , and on their tongue</l>
     <l n="868">Law , liberty , and life are hung ;</l>
     <l n="869">Whom , on inquiry , Truth shall find</l>
     <l n="870">With Stuarts link 'd , time out of mind , 870</l>

     <l n="881">Known or unknown , with furious cry</l>

     <l n="892">A point of honour to a hair —</l>

    <head>THE CANDIDATE .</head>
    <head>This poem was written in 1764 , on occasion of the contest between the Earls of Hardwicke and Sandwich for the High-stewardship of the University of Cambridge , vacant by the death of the Lord Chancellor Hardwicke . The spirit of party ran high in the University , and no means were left untried by either candidate to obtain a majority . The election was fixed for the 30th of March , when , after much altercation , the votes appearing equal , a scrutiny was demanded ; whereupon the Vice-Chancellor adjourned the senate sine die . On appeal to the Lord High-Chancellor , he determined in favour of the Earl of Hardwicke , and a mandamus issued accordingly .</head>

     <l n="416">Blunt as I am , and void of every art ,</l>
     <l n="417">Of every art which great ones in the state</l>
     <l n="418">Practise on knaves they fear , and fools they hate ,</l>
     <l n="419">To titles with reluctance taught to bend ,</l>
     <l n="420">Nor prone to think that virtues can descend , 420</l>
     <l n="421">Do I behold ( a sight , alas ! more rare</l>
     <l n="422">Than Honesty could wish ) the noble wear</l>
     <l n="423">His father 's honours , when his life makes known</l>
     <l n="424">They 're his by virtue , not by birth alone ;</l>
     <l n="425">When he recalls his father from the grave ,</l>
     <l n="426">And pays with interest back that fame he gave :</l>
     <l n="427">Cured of her splenetic and sullen fits ,</l>
     <l n="428">To such a peer my willing soul submits ,</l>
     <l n="429">And to such virtue is more proud to yield</l>
     <l n="430">Than ‘ gainst ten titled rogues to keep the field . 430</l>
     <l n="431">Such , ( for that truth e'en Envy shall allow )</l>
     <l n="432">Such Wyndham was , and such is Sandwich now .</l>
     <l n="433">O gentle Montague ! in blessed hour</l>
     <l n="434">Didst thou start up , and climb the stairs of power ;</l>
     <l n="435">England of all her fears at once was eased ,</l>
     <l n="436">Nor , ‘ mongst her many foes , was one displeased :</l>
     <l n="437">France heard the news , and told it cousin Spain ;</l>
     <l n="438">Spain heard , and told it cousin France again ;</l>
     <l n="439">The Hollander relinquished his design</l>
     <l n="440">Of adding spice to spice , and mine to mine ; 440</l>
     <l n="441">Of Indian villanies he thought no more ,</l>
     <l n="442">Content to rob us on our native shore :</l>
     <l n="443">Awed by thy fame , ( which winds with open mouth</l>
     <l n="444">Shall blow from east to west , from north to south )</l>
     <l n="445">The western world shall yield us her increase ,</l>
     <l n="446">And her wild sons be soften 'd into peace ;</l>
     <l n="447">Rich eastern monarchs shall exhaust their stores ,</l>
     <l n="448">And pour unbounded wealth on Albion 's shores ;</l>
     <l n="449">Unbounded wealth , which from those golden scenes ,</l>
     <l n="450">And all acquired by honourable means , 450</l>
     <l n="451">Some honourable chief shall hither steer ,</l>
     <l n="452">To pay our debts , and set the nation clear .</l>
     <l n="453">Nabobs themselves , allured by thy renown ,</l>
     <l n="454">Shall pay due homage to the English crown ;</l>
     <l n="455">Shall freely as their king our king receive —</l>
     <l n="456">Provided the Directors give them leave .</l>
     <l n="457">Union at home shall mark each rising year ,</l>
     <l n="458">Nor taxes be complain 'd of , though severe ;</l>
     <l n="459">Envy her own destroyer shall become ,</l>
     <l n="460">And Faction with her thousand mouths be dumb : 460</l>
     <l n="461">With the meek man thy meekness shall prevail ,</l>
     <l n="462">Nor with the spirited thy spirit fail :</l>
     <l n="463">Some to thy force of reason shall submit ,</l>
     <l n="464">And some be converts to thy princely wit :</l>
     <l n="465">Reverence for thee shall still a nation 's cries ,</l>
     <l n="466">A grand concurrence crown a grand excise ;</l>

     <l n="468">Who have no faith in God , have faith in thee .</l>
     <l n="469">When a strange jumble , whimsical and vain ,</l>
     <l n="470">Possess 'd the region of each heated brain ; 470</l>
     <l n="471">When some were fools to censure , some to praise ,</l>
     <l n="472">And all were mad , but mad in different ways ;</l>
     <l n="473">When commonwealthsmen , starting at the shade</l>
     <l n="474">Which in their own wild fancy had been made ,</l>
     <l n="475">Of tyrants dream 'd , who wore a thorny crown ,</l>
     <l n="476">And with state bloodhounds hunted Freedom down ;</l>
     <l n="477">When others , struck with fancies not less vain ,</l>
     <l n="478">Saw mighty kings by their own subjects slain ,</l>
     <l n="479">And , in each friend of Liberty and Law ,</l>
     <l n="480">With horror big , a future Cromwell saw , 480</l>
     <l n="481">Thy manly zeal stept forth , bade discord cease ,</l>
     <l n="482">And sung each jarring atom into peace ;</l>
     <l n="483">Liberty , cheer 'd by thy all-cheering eye ,</l>
     <l n="484">Shall , waking from her trance , live and not die ;</l>
     <l n="485">And , patronised by thee , Prerogative</l>
     <l n="486">Shall , striding forth at large , not die , but live ;</l>
     <l n="487">Whilst Privilege , hung betwixt earth and sky ,</l>
     <l n="488">Shall not well know whether to live or die .</l>
     <l n="489">When on a rock which overhung the flood ,</l>
     <l n="490">And seem 'd to totter , Commerce shivering stood ; 490</l>
     <l n="491">When Credit , building on a sandy shore ,</l>
     <l n="492">Saw the sea swell , and heard the tempest roar ,</l>
     <l n="493">Heard death in every blast , and in each wave</l>
     <l n="494">Or saw , or fancied that she saw her grave ;</l>
     <l n="495">When Property , transferr 'd from hand to band ,</l>
     <l n="496">Weaken 'd by change , crawl 'd sickly through the land ;</l>
     <l n="497">When mutual confidence was at an end ,</l>
     <l n="498">And man no longer could on man depend ;</l>
     <l n="499">Oppress 'd with debts of more than common weight ,</l>
     <l n="500">When all men fear 'd a bankruptcy of state ; 500</l>
     <l n="501">When , certain death to honour , and to trade ,</l>
     <l n="502">A sponge was talk 'd of as our only aid ;</l>
     <l n="503">That to be saved we must be more undone ,</l>
     <l n="504">And pay off all our debts , by paying none ;</l>
     <l n="505">Like England 's better genius , born to bless ,</l>
     <l n="506">And snatch his sinking country from distress ,</l>
     <l n="507">Didst thou step forth , and , without sail or oar ,</l>
     <l n="508">Pilot the shatter 'd vessel safe to shore :</l>
     <l n="509">Nor shalt thou quit , till , anchor 'd firm and fast ,</l>
     <l n="510">She rides secure , and mocks the threatening blast ! 510</l>
     <l n="511">Born in thy house , and in thy service bred ,</l>
     <l n="512">Nursed in thy arms , and at thy table fed ,</l>
     <l n="513">By thy sage counsels to reflection brought ,</l>
     <l n="514">Yet more by pattern than by precept taught ,</l>
     <l n="515">Economy her needful aid shall join</l>
     <l n="516">To forward and complete thy grand design ,</l>
     <l n="517">And , warm to save , but yet with spirit warm ,</l>
     <l n="518">Shall her own conduct from thy conduct form .</l>
     <l n="519">Let friends of prodigals say what they will ,</l>
     <l n="520">Spendthrifts at home , abroad are spendthrifts still . 520</l>
     <l n="521">In vain have sly and subtle sophists tried</l>
     <l n="522">Private from public justice to divide ;</l>
     <l n="523">For credit on each other they rely ,</l>
     <l n="524">They live together , and together die ,</l>
     <l n="525">‘ Gainst all experience ‘ tis a rank offence ,</l>
     <l n="526">High treason in the eye of Common-sense ,</l>
     <l n="527">To think a statesman ever can be known</l>
     <l n="528">To pay our debts , who will not pay his own :</l>
     <l n="529">But now , though late , now may we hope to see</l>
     <l n="530">Our debts discharged , our credit fair and free , 530</l>
     <l n="531">Since rigid Honesty ( fair fall that hour ! )</l>
     <l n="532">Sits at the helm , and Sandwich is in power .</l>
     <l n="533">With what delight I view thee , wondrous man ,</l>
     <l n="534">With what delight survey thy sterling plan ,</l>
     <l n="535">That plan which all with wonder must behold ,</l>
     <l n="536">And stamp thy age the only age of Gold .</l>
     <l n="537">Nor rest thy triumphs here — that Discord fled ,</l>
     <l n="538">And sought with grief the hell where she was bred ;</l>
     <l n="539">That Faction , ‘ gainst her nature forced to yield ,</l>
     <l n="540">Saw her rude rabble scatter 'd o'er the field , 540</l>
     <l n="541">Saw her best friends a standing jest become ,</l>
     <l n="542">Her fools turn 'd speakers , and her wits struck dumb ;</l>
     <l n="543">That our most bitter foes ( so much depends</l>
     <l n="544">On men of name ) are turn 'd to cordial friends ;</l>
     <l n="545">That our offended friends ( such terror flows</l>
     <l n="546">From men of name ) dare not appear our foes ;</l>
     <l n="547">That Credit , gasping in the jaws of Death ,</l>
     <l n="548">And ready to expire with every breath ,</l>
     <l n="549">Grows stronger from disease ; that thou hast saved</l>
     <l n="550">Thy drooping country ; that thy name , engraved 550</l>
     <l n="551">On plates of brass , defies the rage of Time ;</l>

     <l n="556">With thee in common other patriots claim .</l>
     <l n="557">But , that poor sickly Science , who had laid</l>

     <l n="559">By those who knew her purposely forgot ,</l>

     <l n="564">Puts on new health , and clothes herself with strength ,</l>
     <l n="565">To thee we owe , and to thy friendly hand</l>
     <l n="566">Which raised , and gave her to possess the land :</l>
     <l n="567">This praise , though in a court , and near a throne ,</l>
     <l n="568">This praise is thine , and thine , alas ! alone .</l>
     <l n="569">With what fond rapture did the goddess smile ,</l>
     <l n="570">What blessings did she promise to this isle , 570</l>
     <l n="571">What honour to herself , and length of reign ,</l>
     <l n="572">Soon as she heard that thou didst not disdain</l>
     <l n="573">To be her steward ; but what grief , what shame ,</l>
     <l n="574">What rage , what disappointment , shook her frame ,</l>
     <l n="575">When her proud children dared her will dispute ,</l>
     <l n="576">When Youth was insolent ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 284 ]</span>and Age was mute !</l>
     <l n="577">That young men should be fools , and some wild few ,</l>
     <l n="578">To Wisdom deaf , be deaf to Interest too ,</l>
     <l n="579">Moved not her wonder ; but that men , grown gray</l>

     <l n="791">Thine be the art , my Sandwich , thine the toil ,</l>
     <l n="792">In Oxford 's stubborn and untoward soil</l>

     <l n="795">Shooting aloft , all danger it defies ,</l>
     <l n="796">And proudly lifts its branches to the skies ;</l>
     <l n="797">Whilst , Wisdom 's happy son but not her slave ,</l>
     <l n="798">Gay with the gay , and with the grave ones grave ,</l>
     <l n="799">Free from the dull impertinence of thought ,</l>
     <l n="800">Beneath that shade , which thy own labours wrought 800</l>
     <l n="801">And fashion 'd into strength , shalt thou repose ,</l>
     <l n="802">Secure of liberal praise , since Isis flows ,</l>
     <l n="803">True to her Tame , as duty hath decreed ,</l>
     <l n="804">Nor longer , like a harlot , lust for Tweed ,</l>
     <l n="805">And those old wreaths , which Oxford once dared twine</l>

    <head>THE FAREWELL .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">P. Farewell to Europe , and at once farewell</l>
     <l n="2">To all the follies which in Europe dwell ;</l>
     <l n="3">To Eastern India now , a richer clime ,</l>
     <l n="4">Richer , alas ! in everything but rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="5">The Muses steer their course ; and , fond of change ,</l>
     <l n="6">At large , in other worlds , desire to range ;</l>
     <l n="7">Resolved , at least , since they the fool must play ,</l>
     <l n="8">To do it in a different place , and way .</l>
     <l n="9">F. What whim is this , what error of the brain ,</l>
     <l n="10">What madness worse than in the dog-star 's reign ? 10</l>
     <l n="11">Why into foreign countries would you roam ,</l>
     <l n="12">Are there not knaves and fools enough at home ?</l>
     <l n="13">If satire be thy object — and thy lays</l>
     <l n="14">As yet have shown no talents fit for praise —</l>
     <l n="15">If satire be thy object , search all round ,</l>
     <l n="16">Nor to thy purpose can one spot be found</l>
     <l n="17">Like England , where , to rampant vigour grown ,</l>
     <l n="18">Vice chokes up every virtue ; where , self-sown ,</l>
     <l n="19">The seeds of folly shoot forth rank and bold ,</l>
     <l n="20">And every seed brings forth a hundredfold . 20</l>
     <l n="21">P. No more of this — though Truth , ( the more our shame ,</l>
     <l n="22">The more our guilt ) though Truth perhaps may claim ,</l>
     <l n="23">And justify her part in this , yet here ,</l>
     <l n="24">For the first time , e'en Truth offends my ear ;</l>
     <l n="25">Declaim from morn to night , from night to morn ,</l>
     <l n="26">Take up the theme anew , when day 's new-born ,</l>
     <l n="27">I hear , and hate — be England what she will ,</l>
     <l n="28">With all her faults , she is my country still .</l>
     <l n="29">F. Thy country ! and what then ? Is that mere word</l>
     <l n="30">Against the voice of Reason to be heard ? 30</l>
     <l n="31">Are prejudices , deep imbibed in youth ,</l>
     <l n="32">To counteract , and make thee hate the truth ?</l>
     <l n="33">‘ Tis sure the symptom of a narrow soul</l>
     <l n="34">To draw its grand attachment from the whole ,</l>
     <l n="35">And take up with a part ; men , not confined</l>
     <l n="36">Within such paltry limits , men design 'd</l>
     <l n="37">Their nature to exalt , where'er they go ,</l>
     <l n="38">Wherever waves can roll , and winds can blow ,</l>
     <l n="39">Where'er the blessed sun , placed in the sky</l>
     <l n="40">To watch this subject world , can dart his eye , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Are still the same , and , prejudice outgrown ,</l>
     <l n="42">Consider every country as their own ;</l>
     <l n="43">At one grand view they take in Nature 's plan ,</l>
     <l n="44">Not more at home in England than Japan .</l>
     <l n="45">P. My good , grave Sir of Theory , whose wit ,</l>
     <l n="46">Grasping at shadows , ne'er caught substance yet ,</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Tis mighty easy o'er a glass of wine</l>
     <l n="48">On vain refinements vainly to refine ,</l>
     <l n="49">To laugh at poverty in plenty 's reign ,</l>
     <l n="50">To boast of apathy when out of pain , 50</l>
     <l n="51">And in each sentence , worthy of the schools ,</l>
     <l n="52">Varnish 'd with sophistry , to deal out rules</l>
     <l n="53">Most fit for practice , but for one poor fault</l>
     <l n="54">That into practice they can ne'er be brought .</l>
     <l n="55">At home , and sitting in your elbow-chair ,</l>
     <l n="56">You praise Japan , though you was never there :</l>
     <l n="57">But was the ship this moment under sail ,</l>
     <l n="58">Would not your mind be changed , your spirits fail ?</l>
     <l n="59">Would you not cast one longing eye to shore ,</l>
     <l n="60">And vow to deal in such wild schemes no more ? 60</l>
     <l n="61">Howe'er our pride may tempt us to conceal</l>
     <l n="62">Those passions which we cannot choose but feel ,</l>
     <l n="63">There 's a strange something , which , without a brain ,</l>
     <l n="64">Fools feel , and which e'en wise men can n't explain ,</l>
     <l n="65">Planted in man to bind him to that earth ,</l>
     <l n="66">In dearest ties , from whence he drew his birth .</l>
     <l n="67">If Honour calls , where'er she points the way</l>
     <l n="68">The sons of Honour follow , and obey ;</l>
     <l n="69">If need compels , wherever we are sent</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Tis want of courage not to be content ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">But , if we have the liberty of choice ,</l>
     <l n="72">And all depends on our own single voice ,</l>
     <l n="73">To deem of every country as the same</l>
     <l n="74">Is rank rebellion ‘ gainst the lawful claim</l>
     <l n="75">Of Nature , and such dull indifference</l>
     <l n="76">May be philosophy , but can n't be sense .</l>
     <l n="77">F. Weak and unjust distinction , strange design ,</l>
     <l n="78">Most peevish , most perverse , to undermine</l>
     <l n="79">Philosophy , and throw her empire down</l>
     <l n="80">By means of Sense , from whom she holds her crown , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Divine Philosophy ! to thee we owe</l>
     <l n="82">All that is worth possessing here below ;</l>
     <l n="83">Virtue and wisdom consecrate thy reign ,</l>
     <l n="84">Doubled each joy , and pain no longer pain .</l>
     <l n="85">When , like a garden , where , for want of toil</l>
     <l n="86">And wholesome discipline , the rich , rank soil</l>
     <l n="87">Teems with incumbrances ; where all around ,</l>
     <l n="88">Herbs , noxious in their nature , make the ground ,</l>
     <l n="89">Like the good mother of a thankless son ,</l>
     <l n="90">Curse her own womb , by fruitfulness undone ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">Like such a garden , when the human soul ,</l>
     <l n="92">Uncultured , wild , impatient of control ,</l>
     <l n="93">Brings forth those passions of luxuriant race ,</l>
     <l n="94">Which spread , and stifle every herb of grace ;</l>
     <l n="95">Whilst Virtue , check 'd by the cold hand of Scorn ,</l>
     <l n="96">Seems withering on the bed where she was born ,</l>
     <l n="97">Philosophy steps in ; with steady hand ,</l>
     <l n="98">She brings her aid , she clears the encumber 'd land ;</l>
     <l n="99">Too virtuous to spare Vice one stroke , too wise</l>
     <l n="100">One moment to attend to Pity 's cries — 100</l>
     <l n="101">See with what godlike , what relentless power</l>
     <l n="102">She roots up every weed !</l>
     <l n="103">P. And every flower .</l>
     <l n="104">Philosophy , a name of meek degree ,</l>
     <l n="105">Embraced , in token of humility ,</l>
     <l n="106">By the proud sage , who , whilst he strove to hide ,</l>
     <l n="107">In that vain artifice reveal 'd his pride ;</l>
     <l n="108">Philosophy , whom Nature had design 'd</l>
     <l n="109">To purge all errors from the human mind ,</l>
     <l n="110">Herself misled by the philosopher ,</l>
     <l n="111">At once her priest and master , made us err : 110</l>
     <l n="112">Pride , pride , like leaven in a mass of flour ,</l>
     <l n="113">Tainted her laws , and made e'en Virtue sour .</l>
     <l n="114">Had she , content within her proper sphere ,</l>
     <l n="115">Taught lessons suited to the human ear ,</l>
     <l n="116">Which might fair Virtue 's genuine fruits produce ,</l>
     <l n="117">Made not for ornament , but real use ,</l>
     <l n="118">The heart of man , unrivall 'd , she had sway 'd ,</l>
     <l n="119">Praised by the good , and by the bad obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="120">But when she , overturning Reason 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="121">Strove proudly in its place to plant her own ; 120</l>
     <l n="122">When she with apathy the breast would steel ,</l>
     <l n="123">And teach us , deeply feeling , not to feel ;</l>
     <l n="124">When she would wildly all her force employ ,</l>
     <l n="125">Not to correct our passions , but destroy ;</l>
     <l n="126">When , not content our nature to restore ,</l>
     <l n="127">As made by God , she made it all new o'er ;</l>
     <l n="128">When , with a strange and criminal excess ,</l>
     <l n="129">To make us more than men , she made us less ;</l>
     <l n="130">The good her dwindled power with pity saw ,</l>
     <l n="131">The bad with joy , and none but fools with awe . 130</l>
     <l n="132">Truth , with a simple and unvarnish 'd tale ,</l>
     <l n="133">E'en from the mouth of Norton might prevail ,</l>
     <l n="134">Could she get there ; but Falsehood 's sugar 'd strain</l>
     <l n="135">Should pour her fatal blandishments in vain ,</l>
     <l n="136">Nor make one convert , though the Siren hung ,</l>
     <l n="137">Where she too often hangs , on Mansfield 's tongue .</l>
     <l n="138">Should all the Sophs , whom in his course the sun</l>

     <l n="433">Where could she find an object that is new ?</l>
     <l n="434">Those travell 'd youths , whom tender mothers wean ,</l>
     <l n="435">And send abroad to see , and to be seen ;</l>
     <l n="436">With whom , lest they should fornicate , or worse ,</l>
     <l n="437">A tutor 's sent by way of a dry nurse ;</l>
     <l n="438">Each of whom just enough of spirit bears</l>
     <l n="439">To show our follies , and to bring home theirs ,</l>
     <l n="440">Have made all Europe 's vices so well known ,</l>
     <l n="441">They seem almost as natural as our own .</l>
     <l n="442">F. Will India for thy purpose better do ? 440</l>
     <l n="443">P. In one respect , at least — there 's something new .</l>
     <l n="444">F. A harmless people , in whom Nature speaks</l>
     <l n="445">Free and untainted ,' mongst whom Satire seeks ,</l>
     <l n="446">But vainly seeks , so simply plain their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="447">One bosom where to lodge her poison 'd darts .</l>
     <l n="448">P. From knowledge speak you this ? or , doubt on doubt</l>
     <l n="449">Weigh 'd and resolved , hath Reason found it out ?</l>
     <l n="450">Neither from knowledge , nor by Reason taught ,</l>
     <l n="451">You have faith every where , but where you ought .</l>
     <l n="452">India or Europe — what 's there in a name ? 450</l>
     <l n="453">Propensity to vice in both the same ,</l>
     <l n="454">Nature alike in both works for man 's good ,</l>
     <l n="455">Alike in both by man himself withstood .</l>
     <l n="456">Nabobs , as well as those who hunt them down ,</l>
     <l n="457">Deserve a cord much better than a crown ,</l>
     <l n="458">And a Mogul can thrones as much debase</l>
     <l n="459">As any polish 'd prince of Christian race .</l>
     <l n="460">F. Could you ,— a task more hard than you suppose ,—</l>
     <l n="461">Could you , in ridicule whilst Satire glows ,</l>
     <l n="462">Make all their follies to the life appear , 460</l>
     <l n="463">‘ Tis ten to one you gain no credit here ;</l>
     <l n="464">Howe'er well drawn , the picture , after all ,</l>
     <l n="465">Because we know not the original ,</l>
     <l n="466">Would not find favour in the public eye .</l>
     <l n="467">P. That , having your good leave , I mean to try :</l>
     <l n="468">And if your observations sterling hold ,</l>
     <l n="469">If the piece should be heavy , tame , and cold ,</l>
     <l n="470">To make it to the side of Nature lean ,</l>
     <l n="471">And meaning nothing , something seem to mean :</l>
     <l n="472">To make the whole in lively colours glow , 470</l>
     <l n="473">To bring before us something that we know ,</l>
     <l n="474">And from all honest men applause to win ,</l>
     <l n="475">I 'll group the Company ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 298 ]</span>and put them in .</l>
     <l n="476">F. Be that ungenerous thought by shame suppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="477">Add not distress to those too much distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="478">Have they not , by blind zeal misled , laid bare</l>
     <l n="479">Those sores which never might endure the air ?</l>
     <l n="480">Have they not brought their mysteries so low ,</l>
     <l n="481">That what the wise suspected not , fools know ?</l>
     <l n="482">From their first rise e'en to the present hour , 480</l>
     <l n="483">Have they not proved their own abuse of power ,</l>
     <l n="484">Made it impossible , if fairly view 'd ,</l>
     <l n="485">Ever to have that dangerous power renew 'd ,</l>
     <l n="486">Whilst , unseduced by ministers , the throne</l>
     <l n="487">Regards our interests , and knows its own ?</l>
     <l n="488">P. Should every other subject chance to fail ,</l>
     <l n="489">Those who have sail 'd , and those who wish 'd to sail</l>
     <l n="490">In the last fleet , afford an ample field ,</l>
     <l n="491">Which must beyond my hopes a harvest yield .</l>
     <l n="492">F. On such vile food Satire can never thrive . 490</l>
     <l n="493">P. She cannot starve , if there was only Clive .<span type="note_anchor">[ 299 ]</span></l>

    <head>THE TIMES .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The time hath been , a boyish , blushing time ,</l>
     <l n="2">When modesty was scarcely held a crime ;</l>
     <l n="3">When the most wicked had some touch of grace ,</l>
     <l n="4">And trembled to meet Virtue face to face ;</l>
     <l n="5">When those , who , in the cause of Sin grown gray ,</l>
     <l n="6">Had served her without grudging day by day ,</l>
     <l n="7">Were yet so weak an awkward shame to feel</l>
     <l n="8">And strove that glorious service to conceal :</l>
     <l n="9">We , better bred , and than our sires more wise ,</l>
     <l n="10">Such paltry narrowness of soul despise : 10</l>
     <l n="11">To virtue every mean pretence disclaim ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lay bare our crimes , and glory in our shame .</l>
     <l n="13">Time was , ere Temperance had fled the realm ,</l>
     <l n="14">Ere Luxury sat guttling at the helm</l>
     <l n="15">From meal to meal , without one moment 's space</l>
     <l n="16">Reserved for business or allow 'd for grace ;</l>
     <l n="17">Ere Vanity had so far conquer 'd Sense</l>
     <l n="18">To make us all wild rivals in expense ,</l>
     <l n="19">To make one fool strive to outvie another ,</l>
     <l n="20">And every coxcomb dress against his brother ; 20</l>
     <l n="21">Ere banish 'd Industry had left our shores ,</l>
     <l n="22">And Labour was by Pride kick 'd out of doors ;</l>
     <l n="23">Ere Idleness prevail 'd sole queen in courts ,</l>
     <l n="24">Or only yielded to a rage for sports ;</l>
     <l n="25">Ere each weak mind was with externals caught ,</l>
     <l n="26">And dissipation held the place of thought ;</l>
     <l n="27">Ere gambling lords in vice so far were gone</l>
     <l n="28">To cog the die , and bid the sun look on ;</l>
     <l n="29">Ere a great nation , not less just than free ,</l>
     <l n="30">Was made a beggar by economy ; 30</l>
     <l n="31">Ere rugged Honesty was out of vogue ;</l>
     <l n="32">Ere Fashion stamp 'd her sanction on the rogue ;</l>
     <l n="33">Time was , that men had conscience , that they made</l>
     <l n="34">Scruples to owe what never could be paid .</l>
     <l n="35">Was one then found , however high his name ,</l>
     <l n="36">So far above his fellows damn 'd to shame ,</l>
     <l n="37">Who dared abuse , and falsify his trust ,</l>
     <l n="38">Who , being great , yet dared to be unjust ,</l>
     <l n="39">Shunn 'd like a plague , or but at distance view 'd ,</l>
     <l n="40">He walk 'd the crowded streets in solitude , 40</l>
     <l n="41">Nor could his rank and station in the land</l>
     <l n="42">Bribe one mean knave to take him by the hand .</l>
     <l n="43">Such rigid maxims ( Oh ! might such revive</l>
     <l n="44">To keep expiring Honesty alive )</l>
     <l n="45">Made rogues , all other hopes of fame denied ,</l>
     <l n="46">Not just through principle , be just through pride .</l>
     <l n="47">Our times , more polish 'd , wear a different face ;</l>
     <l n="48">Debts are an honour , payment a disgrace .</l>
     <l n="49">Men of weak minds , high-placed on Folly 's list ,</l>
     <l n="50">May gravely tell us trade cannot subsist , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Nor all those thousands who 're in trade employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="52">If faith ‘ twixt man and man is once destroy 'd .</l>
     <l n="53">Why — be it so — we in that point accord ;</l>
     <l n="54">But what are trade , and tradesmen , to a lord ?</l>
     <l n="55">Faber , from day to day , from year to year ,</l>
     <l n="56">Hath had the cries of tradesmen in his ear ,</l>
     <l n="57">Of tradesmen by his villany betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="58">And , vainly seeking justice , bankrupts made .</l>
     <l n="59">What is't to Faber ? Lordly as before ,</l>
     <l n="60">He sits at ease , and lives to ruin more : 60</l>
     <l n="61">Fix 'd at his door , as motionless as stone ,</l>
     <l n="62">Begging , but only begging for their own ,</l>
     <l n="63">Unheard they stand , or only heard by those ,</l>
     <l n="64">Those slaves in livery , who mock their woes .</l>
     <l n="65">What is't to Faber ? He continues great ,</l>
     <l n="66">Lives on in grandeur , and runs out in state .</l>
     <l n="67">The helpless widow , wrung with deep despair ,</l>
     <l n="68">In bitterness of soul pours forth her prayer ,</l>
     <l n="69">Hugging her starving babes with streaming eyes ,</l>
     <l n="70">And calls down vengeance , vengeance from the skies . 70</l>
     <l n="71">What is't to Faber ? He stands safe and clear ,</l>
     <l n="72">Heaven can commence no legal action here ;</l>
     <l n="73">And on his breast a mighty plate he wears ,</l>
     <l n="74">A plate more firm than triple brass , which bears</l>
     <l n="75">The name of Privilege , ‘ gainst vulgar awe ;</l>
     <l n="76">He feels no conscience , and he fears no law .</l>
     <l n="77">Nor think , acquainted with small knaves alone ,</l>
     <l n="78">Who have not shame outlived , and grace outgrown ,</l>
     <l n="79">The great world hidden from thy reptile view ,</l>
     <l n="80">That on such men , to whom contempt is due , 80</l>
     <l n="81">Contempt shall fall , and their vile author 's name</l>
     <l n="82">Recorded stand through all the land of shame .</l>
     <l n="83">No — to his porch , like Persians to the sun ,</l>
     <l n="84">Behold contending crowds of courtiers run ;</l>
     <l n="85">See , to his aid what noble troops advance ,</l>
     <l n="86">All sworn to keep his crimes in countenance ;</l>
     <l n="87">Nor wonder at it — they partake the charge ,</l>
     <l n="88">As small their conscience , and their debts as large .</l>
     <l n="89">Propp 'd by such clients , and without control</l>
     <l n="90">From all that 's honest in the human soul ; 90</l>
     <l n="91">In grandeur mean , with insolence unjust ,</l>
     <l n="92">Whilst none but knaves can praise , and fools will trust ,</l>
     <l n="93">Caress 'd and courted , Faber seems to stand</l>
     <l n="94">A mighty pillar in a guilty land .</l>
     <l n="95">And ( a sad truth , to which succeeding times</l>
     <l n="96">Will scarce give credit , when ‘ tis told in rhymes )</l>
     <l n="97">Did not strict Honour with a jealous eye</l>
     <l n="98">Watch round the throne , did not true Piety</l>
     <l n="99">( Who , link 'd with Honour for the noblest ends ,</l>
     <l n="100">Ranks none but honest men amongst her friends ) 100</l>
     <l n="101">Forbid us to be crush 'd with such a weight ,</l>
     <l n="102">He might in time be minister of state .</l>
     <l n="103">But why enlarge I on such petty crimes ?</l>
     <l n="104">They might have shock 'd the faith of former times ,</l>
     <l n="105">But now are held as nothing — we begin</l>
     <l n="106">Where our sires ended , and improve in sin ,</l>
     <l n="107">Rack our invention , and leave nothing new</l>
     <l n="108">In vice and folly for our sons to do .</l>
     <l n="109">Nor deem this censure hard ; there 's not a place</l>
     <l n="110">Most consecrate to purposes of Grace , 110</l>
     <l n="111">Which Vice hath not polluted ; none so high ,</l>
     <l n="112">But with bold pinion she hath dared to fly ,</l>
     <l n="113">And build there for her pleasure ; none so low</l>
     <l n="114">But she hath crept into it , made it know</l>
     <l n="115">And feel her power ; in courts , in camps , she reigns ,</l>
     <l n="116">O'er sober citizens , and simple swains ;</l>
     <l n="117">E'en in our temples she hath fix 'd her throne ,</l>
     <l n="118">And ‘ bove God 's holy altars placed her own .</l>
     <l n="119">More to increase the horror of our state ,</l>
     <l n="120">To make her empire lasting as ‘ tis great ; 120</l>
     <l n="121">To make us , in full-grown perfection , feel</l>
     <l n="122">Curses which neither Art nor Time can heal ;</l>
     <l n="123">All shame discarded , all remains of pride ,</l>
     <l n="124">Meanness sits crown 'd , and triumphs by her side :</l>
     <l n="125">Meanness , who gleans out of the human mind</l>
     <l n="126">Those few good seeds which Vice had left behind ,</l>
     <l n="127">Those seeds which might in time to virtue tend ,</l>
     <l n="128">And leaves the soul without a power to mend ;</l>
     <l n="129">Meanness , at sight of whom , with brave disdain ,</l>
     <l n="130">The breast of Manhood swells , but swells in vain ; 130</l>
     <l n="131">Before whom Honour makes a forced retreat ,</l>
     <l n="132">And Freedom is compell 'd to quit her seat ;</l>
     <l n="133">Meanness , which , like that mark by bloody Cain</l>
     <l n="134">Borne in his forehead for a brother slain ,</l>
     <l n="135">God , in his great and all-subduing rage ,</l>
     <l n="136">Ordains the standing mark of this vile age .</l>
     <l n="137">The venal hero trucks his fame for gold ,</l>
     <l n="138">The patriot 's virtue for a place is sold ;</l>
     <l n="139">The statesman bargains for his country 's shame ,</l>
     <l n="140">And , for preferment , priests their God disclaim ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Worn out with lust , her day of lechery o'er ,</l>
     <l n="142">The mother trains the daughter whom she bore</l>
     <l n="143">In her own paths ; the father aids the plan ,</l>
     <l n="144">And , when the innocent is ripe for man ,</l>
     <l n="145">Sells her to some old lecher for a wife ,</l>
     <l n="146">And makes her an adulteress for life ;</l>
     <l n="147">Or in the papers bids his name appear ,</l>
     <l n="148">And advertises for a L ——:</l>
     <l n="149">Husband and wife ( whom Avarice must applaud )</l>
     <l n="150">Agree to save the charge of pimp and bawd ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">Those parts they play themselves , a frugal pair ,</l>
     <l n="152">And share the infamy , the gain to share ;</l>
     <l n="153">Well pleased to find , when they the profits tell ,</l>
     <l n="154">That they have play 'd the whore and rogue so well .</l>
     <l n="155">Nor are these things ( which might imply a spark</l>
     <l n="156">Of shame still left ) transacted in the dark :</l>
     <l n="157">No — to the public they are open laid ,</l>
     <l n="158">And carried on like any other trade :</l>
     <l n="159">Scorning to mince damnation , and too proud</l>
     <l n="160">To work the works of darkness in a cloud , 160</l>
     <l n="161">In fullest vigour Vice maintains her sway ;</l>
     <l n="162">Free are her marts , and open at noonday .</l>
     <l n="163">Meanness , now wed to Impudence , no more</l>
     <l n="164">In darkness skulks , and trembles , as of yore ,</l>
     <l n="165">When the light breaks upon her coward eye ;</l>
     <l n="166">Boldly she stalks on earth , and to the sky</l>
     <l n="167">Lifts her proud head , nor fears lest time abate ,</l>
     <l n="168">And turn her husband 's love to canker 'd hate ,</l>
     <l n="169">Since Fate , to make them more sincerely one ,</l>
     <l n="170">Hath crown 'd their loves with Montague their son ; 170</l>
     <l n="171">A son so like his dam , so like his sire ,</l>
     <l n="172">With all the mother 's craft , the father 's fire ,</l>
     <l n="173">An image so express in every part ,</l>
     <l n="174">So like in all bad qualities of heart ,</l>
     <l n="175">That , had they fifty children , he alone</l>
     <l n="176">Would stand as heir apparent to the throne .</l>
     <l n="177">With our own island vices not content ,</l>
     <l n="178">We rob our neighbours on the Continent ;</l>
     <l n="179">Dance Europe round , and visit every court ,</l>
     <l n="180">To ape their follies , and their crimes import : 180</l>
     <l n="181">To different lands for different sins we roam ,</l>
     <l n="182">And , richly freighted , bring our cargo home ,</l>
     <l n="183">Nobly industrious to make Vice appear</l>
     <l n="184">In her full state , and perfect only here .</l>
     <l n="185">To Holland , where politeness ever reigns ,</l>
     <l n="186">Where primitive sincerity remains ,</l>
     <l n="187">And makes a stand ; where Freedom in her course</l>
     <l n="188">Hath left her name , though she hath lost her force</l>
     <l n="189">In that as other lands ; where simple Trade</l>
     <l n="190">Was never in the garb of Fraud array 'd ; 190</l>
     <l n="191">Where Avarice never dared to show his head ;</l>
     <l n="192">Where , like a smiling cherub , Mercy , led</l>
     <l n="193">By Reason , blesses the sweet-blooded race ,</l>
     <l n="194">And Cruelty could never find a place ;</l>
     <l n="195">To Holland for that charity we roam ,</l>
     <l n="196">Which happily begins and ends at home .</l>
     <l n="197">France , in return for peace and power restored ,</l>
     <l n="198">For all those countries which the hero 's sword</l>
     <l n="199">Unprofitably purchased , idly thrown</l>
     <l n="200">Into her lap , and made once more her own ; 200</l>
     <l n="201">France hath afforded large and rich supplies</l>
     <l n="202">Of vanities full trimm 'd ; of polish 'd lies ;</l>
     <l n="203">Of soothing flatteries , which through the ears</l>
     <l n="204">Steal to , and melt the heart ; of slavish fears</l>
     <l n="205">Which break the spirit , and of abject fraud —</l>
     <l n="206">For which , alas ! we need not send abroad .</l>
     <l n="207">Spain gives us Pride — which Spain to all the earth</l>
     <l n="208">May largely give , nor fear herself a dearth —</l>
     <l n="209">Gives us that Jealousy , which , born of Fear</l>
     <l n="210">And mean Distrust , grows not by Nature here — 210</l>
     <l n="211">Gives us that Superstition , which pretends</l>
     <l n="212">By the worst means to serve the best of ends —</l>
     <l n="213">That Cruelty , which , stranger to the brave ,</l>
     <l n="214">Dwells only with the coward and the slave ;</l>
     <l n="215">That Cruelty , which led her Christian bands</l>
     <l n="216">With more than savage rage o'er savage lands ,</l>
     <l n="217">Bade her , without remorse , whole countries thin ,</l>
     <l n="218">And hold of nought , but Mercy , as a sin .</l>
     <l n="219">Italia , nurse of every softer art ,</l>
     <l n="220">Who , feigning to refine , unmans the heart ; 220</l>
     <l n="221">Who lays the realms of Sense and Virtue waste ;</l>
     <l n="222">Who mars while she pretends to mend our taste ;</l>
     <l n="223">Italia , to complete and crown our shame ,</l>
     <l n="224">Sends us a fiend , and Legion is his name .</l>

     <l n="359">The turtle , of a great and glorious size ,</l>
     <l n="360">Worth its own weight in gold , a mighty prize 360</l>
     <l n="361">For which a man of taste all risks would run ,</l>
     <l n="362">Itself a feast , and every dish in one ;</l>
     <l n="363">The turtle in luxurious pomp comes in ,</l>
     <l n="364">Kept , kill 'd , cut up , prepared , and dress 'd by Quin ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 300 ]</span></l>
     <l n="365">In vain it comes , in vain lies full in view ;</l>
     <l n="366">As Quin hath dress 'd it , he may eat it too ;</l>
     <l n="367">Apicius cannot . When the glass goes round ,</l>
     <l n="368">Quick-circling , and the roofs with mirth resound ,</l>
     <l n="369">Sober he sits , and silent — all alone</l>
     <l n="370">Though in a crowd , and to himself scarce known : 370</l>
     <l n="371">On grief he feeds : nor friends can cure , nor wine</l>
     <l n="372">Suspend his cares , and make him cease to pine .</l>
     <l n="373">Why mourns Apicius thus ? Why runs his eye ,</l>
     <l n="374">Heedless , o'er delicates , which from the sky</l>
     <l n="375">Might call down Jove ? Where now his generous wish ,</l>
     <l n="376">That , to invent a new and better dish ,</l>
     <l n="377">The world might burn , and all mankind expire ,</l>
     <l n="378">So he might roast a phoenix at the fire ?</l>
     <l n="379">Why swims that eye in tears , which , through a race</l>
     <l n="380">Of sixty years , ne'er show 'd one sign of grace ? 380</l>
     <l n="381">Why feels that heart , which never felt before ?</l>
     <l n="382">Why doth that pamper 'd glutton eat no more ,</l>
     <l n="383">Who only lived to eat , his stomach pall 'd ,</l>
     <l n="384">And drown 'd in floods of sorrow ? Hath Fate call 'd</l>
     <l n="385">His father from the grave to second life ?</l>
     <l n="386">Hath Clodius on his hands return 'd his wife ?</l>
     <l n="387">Or hath the law , by strictest justice taught ,</l>
     <l n="388">Compell 'd him to restore the dow'r she brought ?</l>
     <l n="389">Hath some bold creditor , against his will ,</l>
     <l n="390">Brought in , and forced him to discharge , a bill , 390</l>
     <l n="391">Where eating had no share ? Hath some vain wench</l>
     <l n="392">Run out his wealth , and forced him to retrench ?</l>
     <l n="393">Hath any rival glutton got the start ,</l>
     <l n="394">And beat him in his own luxurious art —</l>
     <l n="395">Bought cates for which Apicius could not pay ,</l>
     <l n="396">Or dress 'd old dainties in a newer way ?</l>
     <l n="397">Hath his cook , worthy to be flain with rods ,</l>

     <l n="399">Or hath some varlet , cross 'd by cruel Fate ,</l>
     <l n="400">Thrown down the price of empires in a plate ? 400</l>
     <l n="401">None , none of these — his servants all are tried :</l>
     <l n="402">So sure , they walk on ice , and never slide ;</l>
     <l n="403">His cook , an acquisition made in France ,</l>
     <l n="404">Might put a Chloe<span type="note_anchor">[ 301 ]</span>out of countenance ;</l>
     <l n="405">Nor , though old Holles still maintains his stand ,</l>
     <l n="406">Hath he one rival glutton in the land .</l>
     <l n="407">Women are all the objects of his hate ;</l>
     <l n="408">His debts are all unpaid , and yet his state</l>
     <l n="409">In full security and triumph held ,</l>
     <l n="410">Unless for once a knave should be expell 'd : 410</l>
     <l n="411">His wife is still a whore , and in his power ,</l>
     <l n="412">The woman gone , he still retains the dower ;</l>
     <l n="413">Sound in the grave ( thanks to his filial care</l>
     <l n="414">Which mix 'd the draught , and kindly sent him there )</l>
     <l n="415">His father sleeps , and , till the last trump shake</l>
     <l n="416">The corners of the earth , shall not awake .</l>
     <l n="417">Whence flows this sorrow , then ? Behind his chair ,</l>
     <l n="418">Didst thou not see , deck 'd with a solitaire ,</l>
     <l n="419">Which on his bare breast glittering play 'd , and graced</l>
     <l n="420">With nicest ornaments , a stripling placed , 420</l>
     <l n="421">A smooth , smug stripling , in life 's fairest prime ?</l>
     <l n="422">Didst thou not mind , too , how from time to time ,</l>
     <l n="423">The monstrous lecher , tempted to despise</l>
     <l n="424">All other dainties , thither turn 'd his eyes ?</l>
     <l n="425">How he seem 'd inly to reproach us all ,</l>
     <l n="426">Who strove his fix 'd attention to recall ,</l>
     <l n="427">And how he wish 'd , e'en at the time of grace ,</l>
     <l n="428">Like Janus , to have had a double face ?</l>
     <l n="429">His cause of grief behold in that fair boy ;</l>
     <l n="430">Apicius dotes , and Corydon is coy . 430</l>
     <l n="431">Vain and unthinking stripling ! when the glass</l>
     <l n="432">Meets thy too curious eye , and , as you pass ,</l>
     <l n="433">Flattering , presents in smiles thy image there ,</l>
     <l n="434">Why dost thou bless the gods , who made thee fair ?</l>
     <l n="435">Blame their large bounties , and with reason blame ;</l>
     <l n="436">Curse , curse thy beauty , for it leads to shame ;</l>
     <l n="437">When thy hot lord , to work thee to his end ,</l>
     <l n="438">Bids showers of gold into thy breast descend ,</l>
     <l n="439">Suspect his gifts , nor the vile giver trust ;</l>
     <l n="440">They 're baits for virtue , and smell strong of lust . 440</l>
     <l n="441">On those gay , gaudy trappings , which adorn</l>
     <l n="442">The temple of thy body , look with scorn ;</l>
     <l n="443">View them with horror ; they pollution mean ,</l>
     <l n="444">And deepest ruin : thou hast often seen</l>
     <l n="445">From ‘ mongst the herd , the fairest and the best</l>
     <l n="446">Carefully singled out , and richly dress 'd ,</l>

     <l n="452">Nor bribes can move , nor arts can undermine ?</l>
     <l n="453">All other methods failing , one resource</l>

     <l n="460">Attend not to his oaths — they 're made on earth , 460</l>
     <l n="461">Not register 'd in heaven — he mocks at Grace ,</l>
     <l n="462">And in his creed God never found a place ;</l>
     <l n="463">Look not for Conscience — for he knows her not ,</l>
     <l n="464">So long a stranger , she is quite forgot ;</l>
     <l n="465">Nor think thyself in law secure and firm ,</l>
     <l n="466">Thy master is a lord , and thou a worm ,</l>
     <l n="467">A poor mean reptile , never meant to think ,</l>

     <l n="476">Headlong to fly into the arms of Stone ?</l>
     <l n="477">Or why take refuge in the house of prayer</l>
     <l n="478">If sure to meet with an Apicius there ?</l>

     <l n="71">Lives on another man , himself a blank ,</l>
     <l n="72">Thankless he lives , or must some grandsire thank</l>
     <l n="73">For smuggled honours , and ill-gotten pelf ;</l>

     <l n="76">When I see men , whom Phoebus in his train</l>
     <l n="77">Might view with pride , lackey the heels of those</l>
     <l n="78">Whom Genius ranks among her greatest foes !</l>
     <l n="79">And what 's the cause ? Why , these same sons of Scorn ,</l>
     <l n="80">No thanks to them , were to a title born , 80</l>
     <l n="81">And could not help it ; by chance hither sent ,</l>

     <l n="88">But Felix never can be made a wit .</l>
     <l n="89">No , in good faith — that 's one of those few things</l>
     <l n="90">Which Fate hath placed beyond the reach of kings : 90</l>
     <l n="91">Bards may be lords , but ‘ tis not in the cards ,</l>
     <l n="92">Play how we will , to turn lords into bards .</l>
     <l n="93">A bard !— a lord !— why , let them , hand in hand ,</l>
     <l n="94">Go forth as friends , and travel through the land ;</l>
     <l n="95">Observe which word the people can digest</l>
     <l n="96">Most readily , which goes to market best ,</l>
     <l n="97">Which gets most credit , whether men will trust</l>
     <l n="98">A bard , because they think he may be just ,</l>
     <l n="99">Or on a lord will chose to risk their gains ,</l>
     <l n="100">Though privilege in that point still remains . 100</l>
     <l n="101">A bard !— a lord !— let Reason take her scales ,</l>
     <l n="102">And fairly weigh those words , see which prevails ,</l>
     <l n="103">Which in the balance lightly kicks the beam ,</l>
     <l n="104">And which , by sinking , we the victor deem .</l>
     <l n="105">‘ Tis done , and Hermes , by command of Jove ,</l>
     <l n="106">Summons a synod in the sacred grove ,</l>
     <l n="107">Gods throng with gods to take their chairs on high ,</l>
     <l n="108">And sit in state , the senate of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="109">Whilst , in a kind of parliament below ,</l>
     <l n="110">Men stare at those above , and want to know 110</l>
     <l n="111">What they 're transacting : Reason takes her stand</l>
     <l n="112">Just in the midst , a balance in her hand ,</l>

     <l n="114">From either side , conducted full in view ,</l>
     <l n="115">A man comes forth , of figure strange and queer ;</l>
     <l n="116">We now and then see something like them here .</l>
     <l n="117">The first<span type="note_anchor">[ 313 ]</span>was meagre , flimsy , void of strength ,</l>

     <l n="119">What she in breadth denied ; erect and proud ,</l>
     <l n="120">A head and shoulders taller than the crowd , 120</l>
     <l n="121">He deem 'd them pigmies all ; loose hung his skin</l>
     <l n="122">O'er his bare bones ; his face so very thin ,</l>
     <l n="123">So very narrow , and so much beat out ,</l>
     <l n="124">That physiognomists have made a doubt ,</l>
     <l n="125">Proportion lost , expression quite forgot ,</l>
     <l n="126">Whether it could be call 'd a face or not ;</l>
     <l n="127">At end of it , howe'er , unbless 'd with beard ,</l>
     <l n="128">Some twenty fathom length of chin appear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="129">With legs , which we might well conceive that Fate</l>
     <l n="130">Meant only to support a spider 's weight , 130</l>
     <l n="131">Firmly he strove to tread , and with a stride ,</l>
     <l n="132">Which show 'd at once his weakness and his pride ,</l>
     <l n="133">Shaking himself to pieces , seem 'd to cry ,</l>
     <l n="134">‘ Observe , good people , how I shake the sky . ’</l>
     <l n="135">In his right hand a paper did he hold ,</l>
     <l n="136">On which , at large , in characters of gold ,</l>
     <l n="137">Distinct , and plain for those who run to see ,</l>
     <l n="138">Saint Archibald<span type="note_anchor">[ 314 ]</span>had wrote L , O , R , D .</l>
     <l n="139">This , with an air of scorn , he from afar</l>
     <l n="140">Twirl 'd into Reason 's scales , and on that bar , 140</l>
     <l n="141">Which from his soul he hated , yet admired ,</l>
     <l n="142">Quick turn 'd his back , and , as he came , retired .</l>
     <l n="143">The judge to all around his name declared ;</l>
     <l n="144">Each goddess titter 'd , each god laugh 'd , Jove stared ,</l>
     <l n="145">And the whole people cried , with one accord ,</l>
     <l n="146">‘ Good Heaven bless us all , is that a Lord ! ’</l>
     <l n="147">Such was the first — the second<span type="note_anchor">[ 315 ]</span>was a man</l>
     <l n="148">Whom Nature built on quite a different plan ;</l>
     <l n="149">A bear , whom , from the moment he was born ,</l>
     <l n="150">His dam despised , and left unlick 'd in scorn ; 150</l>
     <l n="151">A Babel , which , the power of Art outdone ,</l>
     <l n="152">She could not finish when she had begun ;</l>
     <l n="153">An utter Chaos , out of which no might ,</l>
     <l n="154">But that of God , could strike one spark of light .</l>
     <l n="155">Broad were his shoulders , and from blade to blade</l>
     <l n="156">A H —— might at full length have laid ;</l>
     <l n="157">Vast were his bones , his muscles twisted strong ;</l>
     <l n="158">His face was short , but broader than ‘ twas long ;</l>
     <l n="159">His features , though by Nature they were large ,</l>
     <l n="160">Contentment had contrived to overcharge , 160</l>
     <l n="161">And bury meaning , save that we might spy</l>
     <l n="162">Sense lowering on the penthouse of his eye ;</l>
     <l n="163">His arms were two twin oaks ; his legs so stout</l>
     <l n="164">That they might bear a Mansion-house about ;</l>
     <l n="165">Nor were they , look but at his body there ,</l>
     <l n="166">Design 'd by Fate a much less weight to bear .</l>
     <l n="167">O'er a brown cassock , which had once been black ,</l>
     <l n="168">Which hung in tatters on his brawny back ,</l>
     <l n="169">A sight most strange , and awkward to behold ,</l>
     <l n="170">He threw a covering of blue and gold . 170</l>
     <l n="171">Just at that time of life , when man , by rule ,</l>
     <l n="172">The fop laid down , takes up the graver fool ,</l>
     <l n="173">He started up a fop , and , fond of show ,</l>
     <l n="174">Look 'd like another Hercules turn 'd beau ,</l>
     <l n="175">A subject met with only now and then ,</l>
     <l n="176">Much fitter for the pencil than the pen ;</l>
     <l n="177">Hogarth would draw him ( Envy must allow )</l>
     <l n="178">E'en to the life , was Hogarth<span type="note_anchor">[ 316 ]</span>living now .</l>
     <l n="179">With such accoutrements , with such a form ,</l>
     <l n="180">Much like a porpoise just before a storm , 180</l>
     <l n="181">Onward he roll 'd ; a laugh prevail 'd around ;</l>
     <l n="182">E'en Jove was seen to simper ; at the sound</l>
     <l n="183">( Nor was the cause unknown , for from his youth</l>
     <l n="184">Himself he studied by the glass of Truth )</l>
     <l n="185">He joined their mirth ; nor shall the gods condemn ,</l>
     <l n="186">If , whilst they laugh at him , he laugh 'd at them .</l>
     <l n="187">Judge Reason view 'd him with an eye of grace ,</l>
     <l n="188">Look 'd through his soul , and quite forgot his face ,</l>
     <l n="189">And , from his hand received , with fair regard</l>
     <l n="190">Placed in her other scale the name of Bard . 190</l>
     <l n="191">Then , ( for she did as judges ought to do ,</l>
     <l n="192">She nothing of the case beforehand knew ,</l>
     <l n="193">Nor wish 'd to know ; she never stretch 'd the laws ,</l>
     <l n="194">Nor , basely to anticipate a cause ,</l>
     <l n="195">Compell 'd solicitors , no longer free ,</l>
     <l n="196">To show those briefs she had no right to see )</l>
     <l n="197">Then she with equal hand her scales held out ,</l>
     <l n="198">Nor did the cause one moment hang in doubt ;</l>
     <l n="199">She held her scales out fair to public view ,</l>
     <l n="200">The Lord , as sparks fly upwards , upwards flew , 200</l>
     <l n="201">More light than air , deceitful in the weight ;</l>
     <l n="202">The Bard , preponderating , kept his state ;</l>
     <l n="203">Reason approved , and with a voice , whose sound</l>
     <l n="204">Shook earth , shook heaven , on the clearest ground</l>
     <l n="205">Pronouncing for the Bards a full decree ,</l>
     <l n="206">Cried — ‘ Those must honour them , who honour me ;</l>

     <l n="210">Intoxicates , and sways the fools of earth . ’ 210</l>
     <l n="211">Nor think that here , in hatred to a lord ,</l>
     <l n="212">I 've forged a tale , or alter 'd a record ;</l>
     <l n="213">Search when you will , ( I am not now in sport )</l>
     <l n="214">You 'll find it register 'd in Reason 's court .</l>
     <l n="215">Nor think that Envy here hath strung my lyre ,</l>
     <l n="216">That I depreciate what I most admire ,</l>
     <l n="217">And look on titles with an eye of scorn ,</l>
     <l n="218">Because I was not to a title born .</l>
     <l n="219">By Him that made me , I am much more proud ,</l>
     <l n="220">More inly satisfied to have a crowd 220</l>
     <l n="221">Point at me as I pass , and cry — ‘ That 's he —</l>
     <l n="222">A poor but honest bard , who dares be free</l>
     <l n="223">Amidst corruption , ’ than to have a train</l>
     <l n="224">Of flickering levee slaves , to make me vain</l>
     <l n="225">Of things I ought to blush for ; to run , fly ,</l>
     <l n="226">And live but in the motion of my eye ;</l>
     <l n="227">When I am less than man , my faults to adore ,</l>
     <l n="228">And make me think that I am something more .</l>
     <l n="229">Recall past times , bring back the days of old ,</l>
     <l n="230">When the great noble bore his honours bold , 230</l>
     <l n="231">And in the face of peril , when he dared</l>
     <l n="232">Things which his legal bastard , if declared ,</l>
     <l n="233">Might well discredit ; faithful to his trust ,</l>
     <l n="234">In the extremest points of justice , just ,</l>
     <l n="235">Well knowing all , and loved by all he knew ,</l>
     <l n="236">True to his king , and to his country true ;</l>
     <l n="237">Honest at court , above the baits of gain ,</l>
     <l n="238">Plain in his dress , and in his manners plain ;</l>
     <l n="239">Moderate in wealth , generous , but not profuse ,</l>
     <l n="240">Well worthy riches , for he knew their use ; 240</l>
     <l n="241">Possessing much , and yet deserving more ,</l>
     <l n="242">Deserving those high honours which he wore</l>
     <l n="243">With ease to all , and in return gain 'd fame</l>
     <l n="244">Which all men paid , because he did not claim .</l>
     <l n="245">When the grim war was placed in dread array ,</l>
     <l n="246">Fierce as the lion roaring for his prey ,</l>
     <l n="247">Or lioness of royal whelps foredone ;</l>
     <l n="248">In peace , as mild as the departing sun ,</l>
     <l n="249">A general blessing wheresoe'er he turn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="250">Patron of learning , nor himself unlearn 'd ; 250</l>
     <l n="251">Ever awake at Pity 's tender call ,</l>
     <l n="252">A father of the poor , a friend to all ;</l>
     <l n="253">Recall such times , and from the grave bring back</l>
     <l n="254">A worth like this , my heart shall bend , or crack ,</l>
     <l n="255">My stubborn pride give way , my tongue proclaim ,</l>
     <l n="256">And every Muse conspire to swell his fame ,</l>
     <l n="257">Till Envy shall to him that praise allow</l>
     <l n="258">Which she cannot deny to Temple now .</l>
     <l n="259">This justice claims , nor shall the bard forget ,</l>
     <l n="260">Delighted with the task , to pay that debt , 260</l>
     <l n="261">To pay it like a man , and in his lays ,</l>
     <l n="262">Sounding such worth , prove his own right to praise .</l>
     <l n="263">But let not pride and prejudice misdeem ,</l>
     <l n="264">And think that empty titles are my theme ;</l>
     <l n="265">Titles , with me , are vain , and nothing worth ;</l>
     <l n="266">I reverence virtue , but I laugh at birth .</l>
     <l n="267">Give me a lord that 's honest , frank , and brave ,</l>
     <l n="268">I am his friend , but cannot be his slave ;</l>
     <l n="269">Though none , indeed , but blockheads would pretend</l>
     <l n="270">To make a slave , where they may make a friend ; 270</l>
     <l n="271">I love his virtues , and will make them known ,</l>

     <l n="354">As vines to elms , and , twining round their stem ,</l>
     <l n="355">Flourish 'd on high ; to gain this wish 'd support</l>
     <l n="356">E'en Virgil to Maecenas paid his court ?</l>
     <l n="357">As to the custom , ‘ tis a point agreed ,</l>
     <l n="358">But ‘ twas a foolish diffidence , not need ,</l>
     <l n="359">From which it rose ; had bards but truly known</l>
     <l n="360">That strength , which is most properly their own , 360</l>
     <l n="361">Without a lord , unpropp 'd they might have stood ,</l>
     <l n="362">And overtopp 'd those giants of the wood .</l>
     <l n="363">But why , when present times my care engage ,</l>
     <l n="364">Must I go back to the Augustan age ?</l>
     <l n="365">Why , anxious for the living , am I led</l>
     <l n="366">Into the mansions of the ancient dead ?</l>
     <l n="367">Can they find patrons nowhere but at Rome ,</l>
     <l n="368">And must I seek Maecenas in the tomb ?</l>
     <l n="369">Name but a Wingate , twenty fools of note</l>
     <l n="370">Start up , and from report Maecenas quote ; 370</l>
     <l n="371">Under his colours lords are proud to fight ,</l>
     <l n="372">Forgetting that Maecenas was a knight :</l>
     <l n="373">They mention him , as if to use his name</l>
     <l n="374">Was , in some measure , to partake his fame ,</l>
     <l n="375">Though Virgil , was he living , in the street</l>
     <l n="376">Might rot for them , or perish in the Fleet .</l>
     <l n="377">See how they redden , and the charge disclaim —</l>
     <l n="378">Virgil , and in the Fleet !— forbid it , Shame !</l>
     <l n="379">Hence , ye vain boasters ! to the Fleet repair ,</l>
     <l n="380">And ask , with blushes ask , if Lloyd is there ! 380</l>
     <l n="381">Patrons in days of yore were men of sense ,</l>
     <l n="382">Were men of taste , and had a fair pretence</l>
     <l n="383">To rule in letters — some of them were heard</l>
     <l n="384">To read off-hand , and never spell a word ;</l>
     <l n="385">Some of them , too , to such a monstrous height</l>
     <l n="386">Was learning risen , for themselves could write ,</l>
     <l n="387">And kept their secretaries , as the great</l>
     <l n="388">Do many other foolish things , for state .</l>
     <l n="389">Our patrons are of quite a different strain ,</l>
     <l n="390">With neither sense nor taste ; against the grain 390</l>
     <l n="391">They patronise for Fashion 's sake — no more —</l>
     <l n="392">And keep a bard , just as they keep a whore .</l>
     <l n="393">Melcombe ( on such occasions I am loth</l>
     <l n="394">To name the dead ) was a rare proof of both .</l>
     <l n="395">Some of them would be puzzled e'en to read ,</l>
     <l n="396">Nor could deserve their clergy by their creed ;</l>
     <l n="397">Others can write , but such a Pagan hand ,</l>
     <l n="398">A Willes<span type="note_anchor">[ 320 ]</span>should always at our elbow stand :</l>
     <l n="399">Many , if begg 'd , a Chancellor ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 321 ]</span>of right ,</l>
     <l n="400">Would order into keeping at first sight . 400</l>
     <l n="401">Those who stand fairest to the public view</l>
     <l n="402">Take to themselves the praise to others due ,</l>
     <l n="403">They rob the very spital , and make free</l>
     <l n="404">With those , alas ! who 've least to spare . We see</l>
     <l n="405">—— hath not had a word to say ,</l>
     <l n="406">Since winds and waves bore Singlespeech<span type="note_anchor">[ 322 ]</span>away .</l>
     <l n="407">Patrons , in days of yore , like patrons now ,</l>
     <l n="408">Expected that the bard should make his bow</l>
     <l n="409">At coming in , and every now and then</l>
     <l n="410">Hint to the world that they were more than men ; 410</l>
     <l n="411">But , like the patrons of the present day ,</l>
     <l n="412">They never bilk 'd the poet of his pay .</l>
     <l n="413">Virgil loved rural ease , and , far from harm ,</l>
     <l n="414">Maecenas fix 'd him in a neat , snug farm ,</l>
     <l n="415">Where he might , free from trouble , pass his days</l>
     <l n="416">In his own way , and pay his rent in praise .</l>
     <l n="417">Horace loved wine , and , through his friend at court ,</l>
     <l n="418">Could buy it off the quay in every port :</l>
     <l n="419">Horace loved mirth , Maecenas loved it too ;</l>
     <l n="420">They met , they laugh 'd , as Goy<span type="note_anchor">[ 323 ]</span>and I may do , 420</l>
     <l n="421">Nor in those moments paid the least regard</l>
     <l n="422">To which was minister , and which was bard .</l>
     <l n="423">Not so our patrons — grave as grave can be ,</l>
     <l n="424">They know themselves , they keep up dignity ;</l>
     <l n="425">Bards are a forward race , nor is it fit</l>
     <l n="426">That men of fortune rank with men of wit :</l>
     <l n="427">Wit , if familiar made , will find her strength —</l>
     <l n="428">‘ Tis best to keep her weak , and at arm 's length .</l>
     <l n="429">‘ Tis well enough for bards , if patrons give ,</l>
     <l n="430">From hand to mouth , the scanty means to live . 430</l>
     <l n="431">Such is their language , and their practice such ;</l>
     <l n="432">They promise little , and they give not much .</l>
     <l n="433">Let the weak bard , with prostituted strain ,</l>
     <l n="434">Praise that proud Scot whom all good men disdain ;</l>
     <l n="435">What 's his reward ? Why , his own fame undone ,</l>
     <l n="436">He may obtain a patent for the run</l>
     <l n="437">Of his lord 's kitchen , and have ample time ,</l>
     <l n="438">With offal fed , to court the cook in rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="439">Or ( if he strives true patriots to disgrace )</l>
     <l n="440">May at the second table get a place ; 440</l>
     <l n="441">With somewhat greater slaves allow 'd to dine ,</l>
     <l n="442">And play at crambo o'er his gill of wine .</l>
     <l n="443">And are there bards , who , on creation 's file ,</l>
     <l n="444">Stand rank 'd as men , who breathe in this fair isle</l>
     <l n="445">The air of freedom , with so little gall ,</l>
     <l n="446">So low a spirit , prostrate thus to fall</l>
     <l n="447">Before these idols , and without a groan</l>
     <l n="448">Bear wrongs might call forth murmurs from a stone ?</l>
     <l n="449">Better , and much more noble , to abjure</l>
     <l n="450">The sight of men , and in some cave , secure 450</l>
     <l n="451">From all the outrages of Pride , to feast</l>
     <l n="452">On Nature 's salads , and be free at least .</l>
     <l n="453">Better , ( though that , to say the truth , is worse</l>
     <l n="454">Than almost any other modern curse )</l>
     <l n="455">Discard all sense , divorce the thankless Muse ,</l>
     <l n="456">Critics commence , and write in the Reviews ;</l>
     <l n="457">Write without tremor , Griffiths<span type="note_anchor">[ 324 ]</span>cannot read ;</l>
     <l n="458">No fool can fail , where Langhorne can succeed .</l>
     <l n="459">But ( not to make a brave and honest pride</l>
     <l n="460">Try those means first , she must disdain when tried ) 460</l>
     <l n="461">There are a thousand ways , a thousand arts ,</l>
     <l n="462">By which , and fairly , men of real parts</l>
     <l n="463">May gain a living , gain what Nature craves ;</l>
     <l n="464">Let those , who pine for more , live , and be slaves .</l>
     <l n="465">Our real wants in a small compass lie ,</l>
     <l n="466">But lawless appetite , with eager eye ,</l>
     <l n="467">Kept in a constant fever , more requires ,</l>
     <l n="468">And we are burnt up with our own desires .</l>
     <l n="469">Hence our dependence , hence our slavery springs ;</l>
     <l n="470">Bards , if contented , are as great as kings . 470</l>
     <l n="471">Ourselves are to ourselves the cause of ill ;</l>
     <l n="472">We may be independent , if we will .</l>
     <l n="473">The man who suits his spirit to his state</l>
     <l n="474">Stands on an equal footing with the great ;</l>
     <l n="475">Moguls themselves are not more rich , and he</l>
     <l n="476">Who rules the English nation , not more free .</l>
     <l n="477">Chains were not forged more durable and strong</l>
     <l n="478">For bards than others , but they 've worn them long ,</l>
     <l n="479">And therefore wear them still ; they 've quite forgot</l>
     <l n="480">What Freedom is , and therefore prize her not . 480</l>
     <l n="481">Could they , though in their sleep , could they but know</l>
     <l n="482">The blessings which from Independence flow ;</l>
     <l n="483">Could they but have a short and transient gleam</l>
     <l n="484">Of Liberty , though ‘ twas but in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="485">They would no more in bondage bend their knee ,</l>
     <l n="486">But , once made freemen , would be always free .</l>
     <l n="487">The Muse , if she one moment freedom gains ,</l>
     <l n="488">Can nevermore submit to sing in chains .</l>
     <l n="489">Bred in a cage , far from the feather 'd throng ,</l>
     <l n="490">The bird repays his keeper with his song ; 490</l>
     <l n="491">But if some playful child sets wide the door ,</l>
     <l n="492">Abroad he flies , and thinks of home no more ,</l>
     <l n="493">With love of liberty begins to burn ,</l>
     <l n="494">And rather starves than to his cage return .</l>
     <l n="495">Hail , Independence !— by true reason taught ,</l>
     <l n="496">How few have known , and prized thee as they ought !</l>
     <l n="497">Some give thee up for riot ; some , like boys ,</l>
     <l n="498">Resign thee , in their childish moods , for toys ;</l>
     <l n="499">Ambition some , some avarice , misleads ,</l>
     <l n="500">And in both cases Independence bleeds . 500</l>
     <l n="501">Abroad , in quest of thee , how many roam ,</l>
     <l n="502">Nor know they had thee in their reach at home ;</l>
     <l n="503">Some , though about their paths , their beds about ,</l>
     <l n="504">Have never had the sense to find thee out :</l>
     <l n="505">Others , who know of what they are possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="506">Like fearful misers , lock thee in a chest ,</l>
     <l n="507">Nor have the resolution to produce ,</l>
     <l n="508">In these bad times , and bring thee forth for use .</l>
     <l n="509">Hail , Independence !— though thy name 's scarce known ,</l>
     <l n="510">Though thou , alas ! art out of fashion grown , 510</l>
     <l n="511">Though all despise thee , I will not despise ,</l>
     <l n="512">Nor live one moment longer than I prize</l>
     <l n="513">Thy presence , and enjoy : by angry Fate</l>
     <l n="514">Bow 'd down , and almost crush 'd , thou cam'st , though late ,</l>
     <l n="515">Thou cam'st upon me , like a second birth ,</l>
     <l n="516">And made me know what life was truly worth .</l>
     <l n="517">Hail , Independence !— never may my cot ,</l>
     <l n="518">Till I forget thee , be by thee forgot :</l>
     <l n="519">Thither , oh ! thither , oftentimes repair ;</l>
     <l n="520">Cotes ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 325 ]</span>whom thou lovest too , shall meet thee there . 520</l>
     <l n="521">All thoughts but what arise from joy give o'er ,</l>
     <l n="522">Peace dwells within , and law shall guard the door .</l>
     <l n="523">O'erweening Bard ! Law guard thy door ! What law ?</l>
     <l n="524">The law of England . To control and awe</l>
     <l n="525">Those saucy hopes , to strike that spirit dumb ,</l>
     <l n="526">Behold , in state , Administration come !</l>
     <l n="527">Why , let her come , in all her terrors too ;</l>
     <l n="528">I dare to suffer all she dares to do .</l>
     <l n="529">I know her malice well , and know her pride ,</l>
     <l n="530">I know her strength , but will not change my side . 530</l>
     <l n="531">This melting mass of flesh she may control</l>
     <l n="532">With iron ribs — she cannot chain my soul .</l>
     <l n="533">No — to the last resolved her worst to bear ,</l>
     <l n="534">I 'm still at large , and independent there .</l>
     <l n="535">Where is this minister ? where is the band</l>
     <l n="536">Of ready slaves , who at his elbow stand</l>
     <l n="537">To hear , and to perform his wicked will ?</l>
     <l n="538">Why , for the first time , are they slow to ill ?</l>
     <l n="539">When some grand act ‘ gainst law is to be done ,</l>
     <l n="540">Doth —— sleep ; doth blood-hound —— run 540</l>
     <l n="541">To L ——, and worry those small deer ,</l>
     <l n="542">When he might do more precious mischief here ?</l>

     <l n="544">Illegal warrants , and to call them law ?</l>
     <l n="545">Doth ——, at Guildford kick 'd , from Guildford run ,</l>
     <l n="546">With that cold lump of unbaked dough , his son ,</l>
     <l n="547">And , his more honest rival Ketch to cheat ,</l>
     <l n="548">Purchase a burial-place where three ways meet ?</l>
     <l n="549">Believe it not ; —— is —— still ,</l>
     <l n="550">And never sleeps , when he should wake to ill : 550</l>

     <l n="554">Scorns to defraud the hangman of his due .</l>
     <l n="555">O my poor Country !— weak , and overpower 'd</l>
     <l n="556">By thine own sons — ate to the bone — devour 'd</l>
     <l n="557">By vipers , which , in thine own entrails bred ,</l>
     <l n="558">Prey on thy life , and with thy blood are fed ,</l>
     <l n="559">With unavailing grief thy wrongs I see ,</l>
     <l n="560">And , for myself not feeling , feel for thee . 560</l>
     <l n="561">I grieve , but can n't despair — for , lo ! at hand</l>
     <l n="562">Freedom presents a choice , but faithful band</l>
     <l n="563">Of loyal patriots ; men who greatly dare</l>
     <l n="564">In such a noble cause ; men fit to bear</l>
     <l n="565">The weight of empires ; Fortune , Rank , and Sense ,</l>
     <l n="566">Virtue and Knowledge , leagued with Eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="567">March in their ranks ; Freedom from file to file</l>
     <l n="568">Darts her delighted eye , and with a smile</l>
     <l n="569">Approves her honest sons , whilst down her cheek ,</l>
     <l n="570">As ‘ twere by stealth , ( her heart too full to speak ) 570</l>
     <l n="571">One tear in silence creeps , one honest tear ,</l>
     <l n="572">And seems to say , Why is not Granby<span type="note_anchor">[ 326 ]</span>here ? ’</l>
     <l n="573">O ye brave few , in whom we still may find</l>
     <l n="574">A love of virtue , freedom , and mankind !</l>
     <l n="575">Go forth — in majesty of woe array 'd ,</l>
     <l n="576">See at your feet your Country kneels for aid ,</l>
     <l n="577">And , ( many of her children traitors grown )</l>
     <l n="578">Kneels to those sons she still can call her own ;</l>
     <l n="579">Seeming to breathe her last in every breath ,</l>
     <l n="580">She kneels for freedom , or she begs for death — 580</l>
     <l n="581">Fly , then , each duteous son , each English chief ,</l>
     <l n="582">And to your drooping parent bring relief .</l>
     <l n="583">Go forth — nor let the siren voice of Ease</l>
     <l n="584">Tempt ye to sleep , whilst tempests swell the seas ;</l>
     <l n="585">Go forth — nor let Hypocrisy , whose tongue</l>
     <l n="586">With many a fair , false , fatal art is hung ,</l>
     <l n="587">Like Bethel 's fawning prophet , cross your way ,</l>
     <l n="588">When your great errand brooks not of delay ;</l>
     <l n="589">Nor let vain Fear , who cries to all she meets ,</l>
     <l n="590">Trembling and pale , ‘ A lion in the streets , ’ 590</l>
     <l n="591">Damp your free spirits ; let not threats affright ,</l>
     <l n="592">Nor bribes corrupt , nor flatteries delight :</l>
     <l n="593">Be as one man — concord success ensures —</l>
     <l n="594">There 's not an English heart but what is yours .</l>
     <l n="595">Go forth — and Virtue , ever in your sight ,</l>
     <l n="596">Shall be your guide by day , your guard by night —</l>
     <l n="597">Go forth — the champions of your native land ,</l>
     <l n="598">And may the battle prosper in your hand —</l>
     <l n="599">It may , it must — ye cannot be withstood —</l>
     <l n="600">Be your hearts honest , as your cause is good ! 600</l>

     <l n="99">Raised ‘ bove the slavery of common rules ,</l>
     <l n="100">Of common-sense , of modern , ancient schools ,</l>
     <l n="101">Those feelings banish 'd which mislead us all ,</l>
     <l n="102">Fools as we are , and which we Nature call , 100</l>
     <l n="103">He by his great example might impart</l>
     <l n="104">A better something , and baptize it Art ;</l>
     <l n="105">He , all the feelings of my youth forgot ,</l>
     <l n="106">Might show me what is taste by what is not ;</l>
     <l n="107">By him supported , with a proper pride ,</l>
     <l n="108">I might hold all mankind as fools beside ;</l>
     <l n="109">He ( should a world , perverse and peevish grown ,</l>
     <l n="110">Explode his maxims and assert their own )</l>
     <l n="111">Might teach me , like himself , to be content ,</l>
     <l n="112">And let their folly be their punishment ; 110</l>
     <l n="113">Might , like himself , teach his adopted son ,</l>
     <l n="114">‘ Gainst all the world , to quote a Warburton .</l>
     <l n="115">Fool that I was ! could I so much deceive</l>
     <l n="116">My soul with lying hopes ? could I believe</l>
     <l n="117">That he , the servant of his Maker sworn ,</l>
     <l n="118">The servant of his Saviour , would be torn</l>
     <l n="119">From their embrace , and leave that dear employ ,</l>
     <l n="120">The cure of souls , his duty and his joy ,</l>
     <l n="121">For toys like mine , and waste his precious time ,</l>
     <l n="122">On which so much depended , for a rhyme ? 120</l>
     <l n="123">Should he forsake the task he undertook ,</l>
     <l n="124">Desert his flock , and break his pastoral crook ?</l>
     <l n="125">Should he ( forbid it , Heaven ! ) so high in place ,</l>
     <l n="126">So rich in knowledge , quit the work of grace ,</l>
     <l n="127">And , idly wandering o'er the Muses ’ hill ,</l>
     <l n="128">Let the salvation of mankind stand still ?</l>
     <l n="129">Far , far be that from thee — yes , far from thee</l>
     <l n="130">Be such revolt from grace , and far from me</l>
     <l n="131">The will to think it — guilt is in the thought —</l>
     <l n="132">Not so , not so , hath Warburton been taught , 130</l>
     <l n="133">Not so learn 'd Christ . Recall that day , well known ,</l>
     <l n="134">When ( to maintain God 's honour , and his own )</l>
     <l n="135">He call 'd blasphemers forth ; methinks I now</l>
     <l n="136">See stern Rebuke enthroned on his brow ,</l>
     <l n="137">And arm 'd with tenfold terrors — from his tongue ,</l>
     <l n="138">Where fiery zeal and Christian fury hung ,</l>
     <l n="139">Methinks I hear the deep-toned thunders roll ,</l>
     <l n="140">And chill with horror every sinner 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="141">In vain they strive to fly — flight cannot save .</l>
     <l n="142">And Potter trembles even in his grave — 140</l>
     <l n="143">With all the conscious pride of innocence ,</l>
     <l n="144">Methinks I hear him , in his own defence ,</l>
     <l n="145">Bear witness to himself , whilst all men knew ,</l>
     <l n="146">By gospel rules his witness to be true .</l>
     <l n="147">O glorious man ! thy zeal I must commend ,</l>
     <l n="148">Though it deprived me of my dearest friend ;</l>
     <l n="149">The real motives of thy anger known ,</l>
     <l n="150">Wilkes must the justice of that anger own ;</l>
     <l n="151">And , could thy bosom have been bared to view ,</l>
     <l n="152">Pitied himself , in turn had pitied you . 150</l>
     <l n="153">Bred to the law , you wisely took the gown ,</l>
     <l n="154">Which I , like Demas , foolishly laid down ;</l>
     <l n="155">Hence double strength our Holy Mother drew ,</l>
     <l n="156">Me she got rid of , and made prize of you .</l>
     <l n="157">I , like an idle truant fond of play ,</l>
     <l n="158">Doting on toys , and throwing gems away ,</l>
     <l n="159">Grasping at shadows , let the substance slip ;</l>
     <l n="160">But you , my lord , renounced attorneyship</l>
     <l n="161">With better purpose , and more noble aim ,</l>
     <l n="162">And wisely played a more substantial game : 160</l>
     <l n="163">Nor did Law mourn , bless 'd in her younger son ,</l>
     <l n="164">For Mansfield does what Glo'ster would have done .</l>
     <l n="165">Doctor ! Dean ! Bishop ! Glo'ster ! and My Lord !</l>
     <l n="166">If haply these high titles may accord</l>
     <l n="167">With thy meek spirit ; if the barren sound</l>
     <l n="168">Of pride delights thee , to the topmost round</l>
     <l n="169">Of Fortune 's ladder got , despise not one</l>
     <l n="170">For want of smooth hypocrisy undone ,</l>
     <l n="171">Who , far below , turns up his wondering eye ,</l>
     <l n="172">And , without envy , sees thee placed so high : 170</l>
     <l n="173">Let not thy brain ( as brains less potent might )</l>
     <l n="174">Dizzy , confounded , giddy with the height ,</l>
     <l n="175">Turn round , and lose distinction , lose her skill</l>
     <l n="176">And wonted powers of knowing good from ill ,</l>
     <l n="177">Of sifting truth from falsehood , friends from foes ;</l>
     <l n="178">Let Glo'ster well remember how he rose ,</l>
     <l n="179">Nor turn his back on men who made him great ;</l>
     <l n="180">Let him not , gorged with power , and drunk with state ,</l>
     <l n="181">Forget what once he was , though now so high ,</l>
     <l n="182">How low , how mean , and full as poor as I . 180</l>
