    <docTitle><titlePart>FUGITIVE PIECES BY GEORGE GORDON NOËL BYRON REPRODUCED FROM THE FIRST EDITION WITH A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE BY MARCEL KESSEL PUBLISHED FOR THE FACSIMILE TEXT SOCIETY BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESS</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint><settlement>NEW YORK</settlement>: MCMXXXIII BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Fugitive Pieces , Byron 's first volume of verse , was privately printed in the autumn of 1806 , when Byron was eighteen years of age . Passages in Byron 's correspondence indicate that as early as August of that year some of the poems were in the printers ’ hands and that during the latter part of August and during September the printing was suspended in order that Byron might give his poems an “ entire new form . ” The new form consisted , in part , in an enlargement ; for he wrote to Elizabeth Pigot about September that he had nearly doubled his poems “ partly by the discovery of some I conceived to be lost , and partly by some new productions . ” According to Moore , Fugitive Pieces was ready for distribution in November . The last poem in the volume bears the date of November 16 , 1806 .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>A difficulty in supposing the date of completion of the volume to be about November 16 is that two copies contain inscriptions in Byron 's hand with earlier dates . On the copy of the late Mr. J. A . Spoor , of<settlement>Chicago</settlement>, the inscription reads : “ October 21st Tuesday<date>1806</date>— Haec poemata ex dono sunt — Georgii Gordon Byron , Vale . ” That on the copy in the Morgan library reads : “ Nov. 8 ,<date>1806</date>, H. P. E. D. S. G. G. B ., Southwell .— Vale !— Byron , ” the initials evidently standing for the Latin words of the preceding inscription . The Latin “ Vale ” in each inscription , however , suggests that it commemorates a leave-taking , the date referring not to the presentation but to the farewell . It has been suggested that copies of the volume were distributed earlier than November and that some of the poems , printed separately and distributed in fly-leaf form , were added later . This would explain such discrepancies as the early dates of the inscriptions , and the presence of Byron 's name on pages 46 and 48 in a volume otherwise anonymous , but there is little evidence to support it . Moore 's account of Fugitive Pieces is that it was distributed in November , Byron presenting the first copy to the Reverend J. T . Becher , prebendary of Southwell minster , who objected to what he considered the too voluptuous coloring of the poem “ To Mary . ” The objection led Byron to suppress the edition immediately , he himself burning nearly every copy . This account is corroborated in part by Miss Pigot and in part by Byron .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Immediately after the destruction , Byron began the preparation of a second volume , to replace Fugitive Pieces . This appeared in January , 1807 , as Poems on Various Occasions , Byron describing it as “ vastly correct and miraculously chaste . ” Of the 38 poems that constitute Fugitive Pieces , all except “ To Mary , ” “ To Caroline , ” and the last six stanzas of “ To Miss E. P . ” were reprinted in Poems on Various Occasions . Nineteen of the original 38 poems occur in Byron 's third work , Hours of Idleness , published in June or July , 1807 . All three editions were printed by S. and J. Ridge , booksellers of Newark , England .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Byron himself never reprinted the poems “ To Mary ” or “ To Caroline , ” or the last six stanzas of “ To Miss E. P . ” Except in a limited facsimile of Fugitive Pieces , supervised by H. Buxton Forman in<date>1886</date>, “ To Mary ” has never been reprinted — not even in supposedly complete editions of Byron 's works . Only four copies of Fugitive Pieces are known to-day , and one of these is incomplete . The copy from which the present facsimile is made was originally given by Byron to Becher and preserved by him in spite of his objections to the poem “ To Mary . ” From Becher 's family it passed into the possession of Mr. Faulkner , of Louth , solicitor for the Becher family . In<date>1885</date>it was in the possession of H. W . Ball , antiquary and bookseller of Barton-on-Humber , who sold it to H. Buxton Forman . Forman used it for his facsimile , but incorporated certain manuscript corrections of the original , so that his facsimile is not exact . The original is now owned by Mr. Thomas J . Wise , who has kindly permitted its use for the present facsimile . Of the other three copies , the incomplete one , lacking pages 17-20 ( “ To Mary ” ) and all after page 58 , is in the possession of the family of the late Mr. H. C. Roe , of Nottingham . This was originally sent by Byron to Pigot , then studying medicine in Edinburgh . Byron later asked Pigot to destroy the copy and Pigot seems to have complied so far as to tear out the offending verses “ To Mary . ” For many years it was thought that only the Pigot and Becher copies had escaped destruction at Byron 's hands . But another complete copy came to light in<date>1907</date>and is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in<settlement>New York</settlement>. This contains numerous manuscript corrections and alterations , and seems to have been used as a proof copy for Poems on Various Occasions ( not , as has sometimes been stated , for Hours of Idleness ) . A fourth copy , also complete , was offered at public sale in<date>1912</date>, and is now in the hands of the executors of the late Mr. J. A . Spoor , of<settlement>Chicago</settlement>. The present facsimile is an exact photographic reproduction of the text with all typographical and other errors as in the original , except that certain manuscript corrections which appear in the original perforce appear in the photographic reproduction , as follows : Page 3 , To E .... line 2 . “ me ” has been inserted by hand .</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>Page 8 , stanza 5 , line 2 . A letter ( “ s ” ? ) has been erased between “ so ” and “ oft , ” and the second “ e ” of “ meets ” has been inserted to replace “ l . ” Page 14 , line 10 . “ j ” in “ jargon ” has been inserted by hand . Page 19 , stanza ( 11 ) , line 1 . “ night ” was originally printed “ might , ” the “ m ” later changed to “ n ” by erasure . Page 24 , stanza 4 , line 4 . “ s ” in “ setting ” has been inserted by hand . Page 25 , Thoughts Suggested by “ e ” in “ tremble ” has been a College Examination , inserted , correcting “ trimble . ” line 4 . Page 31 , line 4 . “ f ” in “ fast ” was originally “ l , ” but was changed by hand . The text has been collated with that in the Morgan library , and except for later corrections made in ink in the Morgan copy , the only differences noted are as follows : 1 . ) On p. 5 , in the first line of the footnote , the Morgan copy reads “ piece ” where the Wise copy reads “ p * ece , ” the “ [ dotless i ] ” lacking . 2 . ) The two pages of signature M are incorrectly numbered in the Wise copy as “ 41 , 41 , ” this copy having no page numbered 42 ; and are incorrectly numbered in the Morgan copy as “ 40 , 42 , ” the latter copy having no page numbered 41 . The text of these pages is identical . M. K .</p>

TO THOSE FRIENDS , AT WHOSE REQUEST THEY WERE PRINTED , FOR WHOSE AMUSEMENT OR APPROBATION THEY ARE SOLELY INTENDED ; These TRIFLES are respectfully dedicated , BY THE AUTHOR . As these POEMS are never intended to meet the public eye , no apology is necessary for the form in which they now appear . They are printed merely for the perusal of a few friends to whom they are dedicated ; who will look upon them with indulgence ; and as most of them were , composed between the age of 15 and 17 , their defects will be pardoned or forgotten , in the youth and inexperience of the WRITER .

     <l n="3">My Lesbia 's favourite bird is dead ,</l>
     <l n="4">Which dearer than her eyes she lov 'd :</l>
     <l n="5">For he was gentle and so true ,</l>
     <l n="6">Obedient to her call he flew ,</l>
     <l n="7">No fear , no wild alarm he knew ,</l>
     <l n="8">But lightly o'er her bosom mov 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">And softly fluttering here , and there ,</l>
     <l n="10">He never sought to cleave the air ,</l>
     <l n="11">But chirrup 'd oft , and free from care ,</l>
     <l n="12">Tun 'd to her ear his grateful strain .</l>
     <l n="13">But now he 's pass 'd the gloomy bourn ,</l>
     <l n="14">From whence he never can return ,</l>
     <l n="15">His death , and Lesbia 's grief I mourn ,</l>
     <l n="16">Who sighs alas ! but sighs in vain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="17">Oh curst be thou ! devouring grave !</l>
     <l n="18">Whose jaws eternal victims crave ,</l>
     <l n="19">From whom no earthly power can save ,</l>
     <l n="20">For thou hast ta'en the bird away .</l>
     <l n="21">From thee , my Lesbia 's eyes o'erflow ,</l>
     <l n="22">Her swollen cheeks with weeping glow ,</l>
     <l n="23">Thou art the cause of all her woe ,</l>
     <l n="24">Receptacle of life 's decay .</l>

     <l n="1">Oh ! might I kiss those eyes of fire ,</l>
     <l n="2">A million scarce would quench desire ,</l>
     <l n="3">Still would I steep my lips in bliss ,</l>
     <l n="4">And dwell an age on every kiss ;</l>
     <l n="5">Nor then my soul should sated be ,</l>
     <l n="6">Still would I kiss , and cling to thee ,</l>
     <l n="7">Nought should my kiss from thine dissever .</l>
     <l n="8">Still would we kiss , and kiss forever ;</l>
     <l n="9">E'en though the number did exceed ,</l>
     <l n="10">The yellow harvest 's countless seed ,</l>
     <l n="11">To part would be a vain endeavour ,</l>
     <l n="12">Could I desist ?— ah ! never — never .</l>
