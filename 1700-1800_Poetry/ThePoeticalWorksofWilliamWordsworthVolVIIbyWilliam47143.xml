    <head>WORDSWORTH 'S POETICAL WORKS</head>
     <l n="1">1821-2</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The only poems belonging to the years 1821-2 were the “ Ecclesiastical Sonnets , ” originally called “ Ecclesiastical Sketches . ” These were written at intervals , from 1821 onwards , but the great majority belong to 1821 . They were first published in 1822 , in three parts ; 102 Sonnets in all . Ten were added in the edition of 1827 , several others in the years 1835 and 1836 , and fourteen in 1845 ,— the final edition of 1850 containing 132 .</p>
   <p>After Wordsworth 's return from the Continent in 1820 , he visited the Beaumonts at Coleorton , and as Sir George was then about to build a new Church on his property , conversation turned frequently to ecclesiastical topics , and gave rise to the idea of embodying the History of the Church of England in a series of “ Ecclesiastical Sketches ” in verse . The Sonnets Nos . XXXIX ., XL ., and XLI ., in the third series , entitled , Church to be erected , and New Churchyard , are probably those to which Wordsworth refers as written first , in memory of his morning walk with Sir George Beaumont to fix the site of the Church : but it was the discussions which were being carried on in the British Parliament and elsewhere , in 1821 , on the subject of Catholic Disabilities , that led him to enlarge his idea , and project a series of Sonnets dealing with the whole course of the Ecclesiastical History of his country . His brother Christopher — while Dean and Rector of Bocking , and domestic chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury — had published , in 1809 , six volumes of Ecclesiastical Biography ; or , the Lives of Eminent Men connected with the History of Religion in England . Southey 's Book of the Church ,— to which Wordsworth refers in the Fenwick note prefixed to his Sonnets — was not published till 1823 ; and Wordsworth says , in a note to the edition of 1822 , that his own work was far advanced before he was aware that Southey had taken up the subject . As several of the Sonnets , however , are well illustrated by passages in Southey 's book , I have given a number of extracts from the latter work in the editorial notes .</p>
   <p>Southey , writing to C. H. Townshend , on 6th May 1821 , says : “ Wordsworth was with me lately . His thoughts and mine have for some time unconsciously been travelling in the same direction ; for while I have been sketching a brief history of the English Church , and the systems which it has subdued or struggled with , he has been pursuing precisely the same subject in a series of sonnets , to which my volume will serve for a commentary , as completely as if it had been written with that intent . ” ( See Life and Correspondence of R. Southey , vol . v. p . 65 . )</p>
   <p>Wordsworth 's own notes appended to the Sonnets , and others which are added , will show his indebtedness to such writers as Bede , Strype , Foxe , Walton , Whitaker , and Sharon Turner . The subjects of the sonnets on the “ Aspects of Christianity in America ” were suggested to him by Bishop Doane and Professor Henry Reed ; and others in the series , dealing with offices of the English Liturgy , were also suggested by Mr . Reed .— ED .</p>

    <head>ECCLESIASTICAL SONNETS<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></head>
    <head>IN SERIES</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1821 .— Published 1822</l>
   </lg>
   <p>[ My purpose in writing this Series was , as much as possible , to confine my view to the introduction , progress , and operation of the Church in England , both previous and subsequent to the Reformation . The Sonnets were written long before ecclesiastical history and points of doctrine had excited the interest with which they have been recently enquired into and discussed . The former particular is mentioned as an excuse for my having fallen into error in respect to an incident which had been selected as setting forth the height to which the power of the Popedom over temporal sovereignty had attained , and the arrogance with which it was displayed . I allude to the last Sonnet but one in the first series , where Pope Alexander the Third at Venice is described as setting his foot on the neck of the Emperor Barbarossa . Though this is related as a fact in history , I am told it is a mere legend of no authority . Substitute for it an undeniable truth not less fitted for my purpose , namely the penance inflicted by Gregory the Seventh upon the Emperor Henry the Fourth .</p>
   <p>Before I conclude my notice of these Sonnets , let me observe that the opinion I pronounced in favour of Laud ( long before the Oxford Tract Movement ) and which had brought censure upon me from several quarters , is not in the least changed . Omitting here to examine into his conduct in respect to the persecuting spirit with which he has been charged , I am persuaded that most of his aims to restore ritual practices which had been abandoned were good and wise , whatever errors he might commit in the manner he sometimes attempted to enforce them . I further believe that , had not he , and others who shared his opinions and felt as he did , stood up in opposition to the reformers of that period , it is questionable whether the Church would ever have recovered its lost ground and become the blessing it now is , and will , I trust , become in a still greater degree , both to those of its communion and to those who unfortunately are separated from it .— I . F .]</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>During the month of December , 1820 , I accompanied a much-beloved and honoured Friend<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>in a walk through different parts of his estate , with a view to fix upon the site of a new Church which he intended to erect . It was one of the most beautiful mornings of a mild season ,— our feelings were in harmony with the cherishing<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>influences of the scene ; and such being our purpose , we were naturally led to look back upon past events with wonder and gratitude , and on the future with hope . Not long afterwards , some of the Sonnets which will be found towards the close of this series were produced as a private memorial of that morning 's occupation .</p>
   <p>The Catholic Question , which was agitated in Parliament about that time , kept my thoughts in the same course ; and it struck me that certain points in the Ecclesiastical History of our Country might advantageously be presented to view in verse . Accordingly , I took up the subject , and what I now offer to the reader was the result .</p>
   <p>When this work was far advanced , I was agreeably surprised to find that my friend , Mr. Southey , had been engaged with similar views in writing a concise History of the Church in England . If our Productions , thus unintentionally coinciding , shall be found to illustrate each other , it will prove a high gratification to me , which I am sure my friend will participate .</p>

   <p>For the convenience of passing from one point of the subject to another without shocks of abruptness , this work has taken the shape of a series of Sonnets : but the Reader , it is to be hoped , will find that the pictures are often so closely connected as to have jointly the effect of passages of a poem in a form of stanza to which there is no objection but one that bears upon the Poet only — its difficulty .— W .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>“ The first man who laid down his life in Britain for the Christian faith was Saint Alban .... During the tenth , and most rigorous of the persecutions , a Christian priest , flying from his persecutors , came to the City of Verulamium , and took shelter in Alban 's house : he , not being of the faith himself , concealed him for pure compassion ; but when he observed the devotion of his guest , how fervent it was , and how firm , his heart was touched .... When the persecutors came to search the house , Alban , putting on the hair-cassock of his teacher , delivered himself into their hands , as if he had been the fugitive , and was carried before the heathen governor .... Because he refused to betray his guest or offer sacrifices to the Roman gods , he was scourged , and then led to execution upon the spot where the abbey now stands , which in after times was erected to his memory , and still bears his name . That spot was then a beautiful meadow upon a little rising ground , ‘ seeming , ’ says the venerable Bede , ‘ a fit theatre for the martyr 's triumph . ’ ” ( Southey 's Book of the Church , vol . i .— pp . 13-14 . ) — ED .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>This hill at St. Albans must have been an object of great interest to the imagination of the venerable Bede , who thus describes it , with a delicate feeling , delightful to meet with in that rude age , traces of which are frequent in his works :— “ Variis herbarum floribus depictus imo usquequaque vestitus , in quo nihil repente arduum , nihil praeceps , nihil abruptum , quem lateribus longe lateque deductum in modum aequoris natura complanat , dignum videlicet eum pro insita sibi specie venustatis jam olim reddens , qui beati martyris cruore dicaretur . ” — W.

   <p>The Saxons and Picts threatening the Britons , the latter asked the assistance of Germanus . The following is Bede 's account :— “ Germanus bearing in his hands the standard , instructed his men all in a loud voice to repeat his words , and the enemy advancing securely , as thinking to take them by surprise , the priests three times cried Hallelujah . A universal shout of the same word followed , and the hills resounding the echo on all sides , the enemy was struck with dread .... They fled in disorder , casting away their arms . ” ( Bede , Ecclesiastica Historia gentis Anglorum , book i. chap . xx . ) — ED .</p>

Thus abandoned by their leader , his army soon gave way , and Ethelforth obtained a decisive conquest . Ancient Bangor itself soon fell into his hands , and was demolished ; the noble monastery was levelled to the ground ; its library , which is mentioned as a large one , the collection of ages , the repository of the most precious monuments of the ancient Britons , was consumed ; half ruined walls , gates , and rubbish were all that remained of the magnificent edifice . ” ( See Turner 's valuable history of the Anglo-Saxons . )</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>The story is told of Gregory who was afterwards Pope , and is known as Gregory the Great , that “ he was one day led into the market-place at Rome to look at a large importation from , abroad . Among other things there were some boys exposed for sale like cattle . He was struck by the appearance of the boys , their fine clear skins , their flaxen or golden hair , and their ingenuous countenances ; so that he asked from what country they came ; and when he was told from the island of Britain , ... and were Angles , he played upon the word and said , ‘ Well may they be so called , for they are like Angels . ’ ... Then demanding from what province they were brought , the answer was ‘ from Deira ’ ; and in the same humour he observed that rightly might this also be said , for de Dei ira , from the wrath of God were they to be delivered . And when he was told that their King was AElla , he replied that Hallelujahs ought to be sung in his dominions . This trifling sprung from serious thought . From that day the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons became a favourite object with Gregory . ” ( Southey 's Book of the Church , vol . i. pp . 22 , 23 . ) — ED .</p>

According to Bede , “ Some days after , the king came into the island and ordered Augustin and his companions to be brought into his presence ....

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>See the original of this speech in Bede .— The Conversion of Edwin , as related by him , is highly interesting — and the breaking up of this Council accompanied with an event so striking and characteristic , that I am tempted to give it at length in a translation . “ Who , exclaimed the King , when the Council was ended , shall first desecrate the altars and the temples ? I , answered the Chief Priest : for who more fit than myself , through the wisdom which the true God hath given me , to destroy , for the good example of others , what in foolishness I worshipped ? Immediately , casting away vain superstition , he besought the King to grant him what the laws did not allow to a priest , arms and a courser ( equum emissarium ) ; which mounting , and furnished with a sword and lance , he proceeded to destroy the Idols . The crowd , seeing this , thought him mad — he however , halted not , but , approaching , he profaned the temple , casting it against the lance which he had held in his hand , and , exulting in acknowledgement of the worship of the true God , he ordered his companions to pull down the temple , with all its enclosures . The place is shown where those idols formerly stood , not far from York , at the source of the river Derwent , and is at this day called Gormund Gaham [ W. W. 1822 ] , ubi pontifex ille , inspirante Deo vero , polluit ac destruxit eas , quas ipse sacraverat aras . ” The last expression is a pleasing proof that the venerable monk of Wearmouth was familiar with the poetry of Virgil .— W . W. 1832 .</p>
   <p>The following is Bede 's account of the speech of “ another of the king 's chief men ":— “ The present life of man , O king , seems to me in comparison of that time which is unknown to us , like to the swift flight of a sparrow through the room wherein you sit , at supper in winter , with your commanders and ministers , and a good fire in the midst , whilst the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad . The sparrow , I say — flying in at one door , and immediately out at another — whilst he is within , is safe from the misty storm ; but , after a short space of fair weather , he immediately vanishes out of your sight into the dark winter from which he had emerged . So this life of man appears for a short space , but of what went before , and of what is to follow , we are utterly ignorant . If therefore this new doctrine contains something more certain , it seems justly to deserve to be followed . ” — ED .</p>

He lived solely for the good of his people . He is the first instance in the history of Christendom of the Christian king , of a ruler who put aside every personal aim or ambition to devote himself to the welfare of those whom he ruled . So long as he lived he strove ‘ to live worthily ’ ; but in his mouth a life of worthiness meant a life of justice , temperance , and self-sacrifice . Ardent warrior as he was , with a disorganised England before him , he set aside at thirty-one the dream of conquest to leave behind him the memory , not of victories , but of ‘ good works , ’ of daily toils by which he secured peace , good government , education for his people .... The spirit of adventure that made him in youth the first huntsman of his day took later and graver form in an activity that found time amidst the cares of state for the daily duties of religion , for converse with strangers , for study and translation , for learning poems by heart , for planning buildings and instructing craftsmen in gold work , for teaching even falconers and dog-keepers their business .... He himself superintended a school for the young nobles of the court . ” ( Green 's Short History of the English People , chap . i. sec . 5 . ) — ED .</p>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>At the command of Pope Innocent III ., the Bishops of London , Ely , and Worcester were charged to lay England under an interdict . They did so , in defiance of King John , and left England . Southey 's description of the result maybe compared with this sonnet . “ All the rites of a Church whose policy it was to blend its institutions with the whole business of private life were suddenly suspended : no bell heard , no taper lighted , no service performed , no church open ; only baptism was permitted , and confession and sacrament for the dying . The dead were either interred in unhallowed ground , without the presence of a priest , or any religious ceremony , ... or they were kept unburied .... Some little mitigation was allowed , lest human nature should have rebelled against so intolerable a tyranny . The people , therefore , were called to prayers and sermon on the Sunday , in the churchyards , and marriages were performed at the church door . ” ( Southey 's Book of the Church , vol . i. chap . ix . pp . 261 , 262 . ) — ED .</head>

   <p>In this age a word cannot be said in praise of Laud , or even in compassion for his fate , without incurring a charge of bigotry ; but fearless of such imputation , I concur with Hume , “ that it is sufficient for his vindication to observe that his errors were the most excusable of all those which prevailed during that zealous period . ” A key to the right understanding of those parts of his conduct that brought the most odium upon him in his own time , may be found in the following passage of his speech before the bar of the House of Peers :— “ Ever since I came in place , I have laboured nothing more than that the external publick worship of God , so much slighted in divers parts of this kingdom , might be preserved , and that with as much decency and uniformity as might be . For I evidently saw that the public neglect of God 's service in the outward face of it , and the nasty lying of many places dedicated to that service , had almost cast a damp upon the true and inward worship of God , which while we live in the body , needs external helps , and all little enough to keep it in any vigour . ” — W.

    <p>PART III</p>
   <p>FROM THE RESTORATION TO THE PRESENT TIMES</p>
   <p>[ When I came to this part of the series I had the dream described in this Sonnet .<span type="note_anchor">[ 241 ]</span>The figure was that of my daughter , and the whole passed exactly as here represented . The Sonnet was composed on the middle road leading from Grasmere to Ambleside : it was begun as I left the last house of the vale , and finished , word for word as it now stands , before I came in view of Rydal . I wish I could say the same of the five or six hundred I have written : most of them were frequently retouched in the course of composition , and , not a few , laboriously .</p>
   <p>I have only further to observe that the intended Church which prompted these Sonnets was erected on Coleorton Moor towards the centre of a very populous parish between three and four miles from Ashby-de-la-Zouch , on the road to Loughborough , and has proved , I believe , a great benefit to the neighbourhood .— I.

He ordered the Ecclesiastical Commissioners , to deprive them of their Sees , and the Bishops were sent to the Tower . “ They passed to their prison amidst the shouts of a great multitude , the sentinels knelt for their blessing as they entered the gates , and the soldiers of the garrison drank their healths ....

I wish they had been more worthy of the subject : I hope , however , you will not disapprove of the connection which I have thought myself warranted in tracing between the Puritan fugitives and Episcopacy . ” — ED .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 280 ]</span>American episcopacy , in union with the church in England , strictly belongs to the general subject ; and I here make my acknowledgments to my American friends , Bishop Doane , and Mr. Henry Reed of Philadelphia , for having suggested to me the propriety of adverting to it , and pointed out the virtues and intellectual qualities of Bishop White , which so eminently fitted him for the great work he undertook . Bishop White was consecrated at Lambeth , Feb. 4 , 1787 , by Archbishop Moore ; and before his long life was closed , twenty-six bishops had been consecrated in America , by himself . For his character and opinions , see his own numerous Works , and a “ Sermon in commemoration of him , by George Washington Doane , Bishop of New Jersey . ” — W. W. 1845 .</p>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 285 ]</span>Among the benefits arising , as Mr. Coleridge has well observed , from a Church establishment of endowments corresponding with the wealth of the country to which it belongs , may be reckoned as eminently important , the examples of civility and refinement which the Clergy stationed at intervals , afford to the whole people . The established clergy in many parts of England have long been , as they continue to be , the principal bulwark against barbarism , and the link which unites the sequestered peasantry with the intellectual advancement of the age . Nor is it below the dignity of the subject to observe , that their taste , as acting upon rural residences and scenery , often furnishes models which country gentlemen , who are more at liberty to follow the caprices of fashion , might profit by . The precincts of an old residence must be treated by ecclesiastics with respect , both from prudence and necessity . I remember being much pleased , some years ago , at Rose Castle , the rural seat of the See of Carlisle , with a style of garden and architecture which , if the place had belonged to a wealthy layman , would no doubt have been swept away . A parsonage-house generally stands not far from the church ; this proximity imposes favourable restraints , and sometimes suggests an affecting union of the accommodations and elegancies of life with the outward signs of piety and mortality . With pleasure I recall to mind a happy instance of this in the residence of an old and much-valued Friend in Oxfordshire . The house and church stand parallel to each other , at a small distance ; a circular lawn or rather grass-plot , spreads between them ; shrubs and trees curve from each side of the dwelling , veiling , but not hiding , the church . From the front of this dwelling , no part of the burial-ground is seen ; but as you wind by the side of the shrubs towards the steeple-end of the church , the eye catches a single , small , low , monumental headstone , moss-grown , sinking into , and gently inclining towards the earth . Advance , and the churchyard , populous and gay with glittering tombstones , opens upon the view . This humble , and beautiful parsonage called forth a tribute which will not be out of its place here .— W . W. 1822 .</head>

   <note>After thanking Lady Fleming in prose for the service she had done to her neighbourhood by erecting this Chapel , I have nothing to say beyond the expression of regret that the architect did not furnish an elevation better suited to the site in a narrow mountain-pass , and , what is of more consequence , better constructed in the interior for the purposes of worship . It has no chancel ; the altar is unbecomingly confined ; the pews are so narrow as to preclude the possibility of kneeling with comfort ; there is no vestry ; and what ought to have been first mentioned , the font , instead of standing at its proper place at the entrance , is thrust into the farther end of a pew . When these defects shall be pointed out to the munificent Patroness , they will , it is hoped , be corrected .— I . F. [ 342</note>

   <note>In this Vale of Meditation my friend Jones resided , having been allowed by his diocesan to fix himself there without resigning his Living in Oxfordshire . He was with my wife and daughter and me when we visited these celebrated ladies who had retired , as one may say , into notice in this vale . Their cottage lay directly in the road between London and Dublin , and they were of course visited by their Irish friends as well as innumerable strangers . They took much delight in passing jokes on our friend Jones 's plumpness , ruddy cheeks and smiling countenance , as little suited to a hermit living in the Vale of Meditation . We all thought there was ample room for retort on his part , so curious was the appearance of these ladies , so elaborately sentimental about themselves and their Caro Albergo as they named it in an inscription on a tree that stood opposite , the endearing epithet being preceded by the word Ecco ! calling upon the saunterer to look about him . So oddly was one of these ladies attired that we took her , at a little distance , for a Roman Catholic priest , with a crucifix and relics hung at his neck . They were without caps , their hair bushy and white as snow , which contributed to the mistake .— I . F .</note>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 396 ]</span>Plass Newidd is close to Llangollen , a small cottage a quarter of a mile to the south of the town . The ladies referred to in the Fenwick note , Lady Eleanor Butler and the Hon . Miss Ponsonby , formed a romantic attachment ; and , having an extreme love of independence , they withdrew from society , and settled in this remote and secluded cottage . Lady Butler died in 1829 , aged ninety , and Miss Ponsonby in 1831 , aged seventy-six , their faithful servant , Mary Caroll , having predeceased them . The three are buried in the same grave in Llangollen Churchyard , and an inscription to the memory of each is carved on a triangular pillar beside their tomb .</p>
   <p>In a letter to Sir George Beaumont from Hindwell , Radnorshire , Wordsworth gives an account of this tour in North Wales .... “ We turned from the high-road three or four miles to visit the ‘ Valley of Meditation ’ ( Glyn Myvyr ) , where Mr. Jones has , at present , a curacy with a comfortable parsonage . We slept at Corwen , and went down the Dee to Llangollen , which you and dear Lady B. know well . Called upon the celebrated Recluses , who hoped that you and Lady B. had not forgotten them .... Next day I sent them the following sonnet from Ruthin , which was conceived , and in a great measure composed , in their grounds . ” Compare Sir Walter Scott 's account of his visit to these Ladies in 1825 ( Lockhart 's Life of Scott , vol . viii . pp . 48 , 49 ) .— ED .</p>

Like the Teufelsbruecke , on the road from Goeschenen to Airola , over the St. Gotthard in Switzerland , which spans the Reuss , the Devil 's Bridge in Wales is double ; i. e . an upper and an under bridge span the river Mynach .

   <p>In the letter to Sir George Beaumont , referred to in a previous note , Wordsworth writes : “ We went up the Rhydiol to the Devil 's Bridge , where we passed the following day in exploring these two rivers , and Hafod in the neighbourhood .

   <note>On Mrs. Fermor . This lady had been a widow long before I knew her . Her husband was of the family of the lady celebrated in the Rape of the Lock , and was , I believe , a Roman Catholic . The sorrow which his death caused her was fearful in its character as described in this poem , but was subdued in course of time by the strength of her religious faith . I have been for many weeks at a time , an inmate with her at Coleorton Hall , as were also Mrs. Wordsworth and my sister . The truth in the sketch of her character here given was acknowledged with gratitude by her nearest relatives . She was eloquent in conversation , energetic upon public matters , open in respect to those , but slow to communicate her personal feelings ; upon these she never touched in her intercourse with me , so that I could not regard myself as her confidential friend , and was accordingly surprised when I learnt she had left me a legacy of L100 , as a token of her esteem . See in further illustration the second stanza inscribed upon her cenotaph in Coleorton church .— I. F .</note>

   <p>Mrs. Wordsworth also says , “ To fit the lines , intended for an urn , for a Monument , W. has altered the closing stanza , which ( though they are not what he would have produced had he first cast them with a view to the Church ) he hopes you will not disapprove . ” — ED .</p>

   <note>These verses perhaps had better be transferred to the class of “ Italian Poems . ” I had observed in the newspaper , that the Pillar of Trajan was given as a subject for a prize-poem in English verse . I had a wish perhaps that my son , who was then an undergraduate at Oxford , should try his fortune , and I told him so ; but he , not having been accustomed to write verse , wisely declined to enter on the task ; whereupon I showed him these lines as a proof of what might , without difficulty , be done on such a subject .— I.

   <p>Trajan 's Column was set up by the Senate and people of Rome , in honour of the Emperor , about A. D. 114 . It is one of the most remarkable pillars in the world ; and still stands , little injured by time , in the centre of the Forum Trajanum ( now a ruin ) ; its height — 132 feet — marking the height of the earth removed when the Forum was made . On the pedestal bas-reliefs were carved in series showing the arms and armour of the Romans ; and round the shaft of the column similar reliefs , exhibiting pictorially the whole story of the Decian campaign of the Emperor . These are of great value as illustrating the history of the period , the costume of the Roman soldiers and the barbarians . A colossal statue of Trajan crowned the column ; and , when it fell , Pope Sixtus V. replaced it by a figure of St. Peter . It is referred to by Pausanias ( v. 12 . 6 ) , and by all the ancient topographers . See a minute account of it , with excellent illustrations , in Hertzberg 's Geschichte des Roemischen Kaiserreiches , pp . 330-345 ( Berlin : 1880 ) ; also Mueller 's Denkmaeler der alten Kunst , p. 51 . The book , however , from which Wordsworth gained his information of this pillar was evidently Joseph Forsyth 's Remarks on Antiquities , Arts , and Letters , during an Excursion in Italy in 1802-3 ( London : 1813 ) . It is thus that Dean Merivale speaks of it :—</p>
   <p>“ Amid this profusion of splendour ” ( i. e . in the Forum Trajanum ) “ the great object to which the eye was principally directed was the column , which rose majestically in the centre of the forum to the height of 126 feet , sculptured from the base of the shaft to the summit with the story of the Decian wars , shining in every volute and moulding , with gold and pigments , and crowned with the colossal effigy of the august conqueror .... The proportions of the Trajan column are peculiarly graceful ; the compact masses of stone , nineteen in number , of which the whole shaft is composed , may lead us to admire the skill employed in its construction ; but the most interesting feature of this historic monument is the spiral band of figures which throughout enriches it . To the subjects of Trajan himself , this record of his exploits in bold relief must have given a vivid and sufficient idea of the people , the places , and the actions indicated ; even to us , after so many centuries , they furnish a correct type of the arms , the arts , and the costume both of the Romans and barbarians which we should vainly seek for elsewhere . The Trajan column forms a notable chapter in the pictorial history of Rome . ” ( History of the Romans under the Empire , vol . viii . pp . 46 , 47 . )</p>
   <p>In the Fenwick note , Wordsworth mentions that , what gave rise to this poem was , his observing in the newspapers that “ the Pillar of Trajan ” was prescribed as a subject for a prize poem at Oxford . This determines the date of composition . The Pillar of Trajan was the Newdigate prize poem , won by W. W. Tireman , Wadham Coll ., in 1826 . We may therefore assume that the subject was proposed about the summer of 1825 .— ED .</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 411 ]</span>As Wordsworth says , in his note of 1827 , “ See Forsyth , ” it may be interesting to add Forsyth 's account of the Pillar , in footnotes . “ Trajan 's Column , considered as a long historical record to be read round and round a long convex surface , made perspective impossible . Every perspective has one fixed point of view , but here are ten thousand . The eye , like the relievos of the column , must describe a spiral round them , widening over the whole piazza . Hence , to be legible the figures must be lengthened as they rise . This licence is necessary here ; but in architecture it may be contested against Vitruvius himself . ” ( Forsyth 's Remarks on Antiquities , Arts , and Letters , during an Excursion in Italy in 1802-3 , pp . 250 , 251 . ) — ED .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 412 ]</span>“ In detailing the two wars , this column sets each nation in contrast : here the Moorish horse , all naked and unharnessed ” ( Forsyth 's Remarks , etc ., p . 251 . ) — ED .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 413 ]</span>See Forsyth .— W . W. 1827 .</p>
   <p>“ There the Taranatians , in complete mail down to the fingers and the hoofs . It exhibits without embellishment all the tactics of that age , and forms grand commentary on Vegetius and Frontinus . ” ( Remarks , etc ., p . 252 . ) — ED .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 414 ]</span>“ How unlike the modern relievos , where dress appears in all its distinctions , and prostration in all its angles ! none kneel here but priests and captives ; no Roman appears in a fallen state : none are wounded or slain but the foe .</p>
   <p>“ No monument gives the complete and real costume of its kind so correctly as this column .... On this column we can see parts of the subarmalia ; we can see real drawers falling down to the officers ’ legs ; and some figures have focalia , like invalids , round the neck . ” ( Remarks , etc ., p . 251-2 . ) — ED .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 415 ]</span>“ This column is an immense field of antiquities , where the emperor appears in a hundred different points , as sovereign , as general , as priest . ” ( Remarks , etc ., p . 251 . ) — ED .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 416 ]</span>“ His dignity he derives from himself or his duties ; not from the trappings of power , for he is dressed like any of his officers , not from the debasement of others , for the Romans stand bold and erect before him . ” ( Remarks , etc ., p . 251 . ) — ED .</p>

   <note>This and the following poem originated in the lines , “ How delicate the leafy veil , ” etc . My daughter and I left Rydal Mount upon a tour through our mountains , with Mr. and Mrs. Carr ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 423 ]</span>in the month of May , 1826 , and as we were going up the Vale of Newlands I was struck with the appearance of the little chapel gleaming through the veil of half-opened leaves ; and the feeling which was then conveyed to my mind was expressed in the stanza referred to above . As in the case of Liberty and Humanity , my first intention was to write only one poem , but subsequently I broke it into two , making additions to each part so as to produce a consistent and appropriate whole .— I .

Ambleside was a Roman station . “ At the upper corner of Windermere lieth the dead carcase of an ancient city , with great ruins of walls , and many heaps of rubbish , one from another , remaining of building without the walls , yet to be seen . The fortress thereof was somewhat long , fenced with a ditch and rampire , took up in length 132 ells , and breadth 80 . That it had been the Romans ’ work is evident by the British bricks , by the mortar tempered with little pieces of brick among it , by small earthen pots or pitchers , by small cruets or phials of glass , by pieces of Roman money oftentimes found , and by round stones as big as millstones or quernstones , of which laid and couched together they framed in old times their columns , and by the paved ways leading to it . Now the ancient name is gone , unless a man would guess at it , and think it were that Amboglana , whereof the book of notices maketh mention , seeing at this day it is called Ambleside . ” — See Camden 's Britannia , 645 ( edition 1590 ) .— ED .</p>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 435 ]</span>As Charles Lamb retired to Enfield in 1826 , these lines cannot have been composed much later than that year , although they were not published till 1842 . Lamb wrote thus to Wordsworth on the 6th of April 1825 : “ I came home FOR EVER on Tuesday in last week . The incomprehensibleness of my condition overwhelmed me . It was like passing from life into eternity . ... I wandered about , thinking I was happy , but feeling I was not . But that tumultuousness is passing off , and I begin to understand the nature of the gift . Holidays , even the annual month , were always uneasy joys : their conscious fugitiveness ; the craving after making the most of them . Now , when all is holiday , there are no holidays . I can sit at home , in rain or shine , without a restless impulse for walkings . I am daily steadying , and shall soon find it as natural to me to be my own master , as it has been irksome to have had a master . Mary wakes every morning with an obscure feeling that some good has happened to us . ” — ED .</head>

   </lg>
   <note>In the cottage , Town-end , Grasmere , one afternoon in 1801 , my Sister read to me the Sonnets of Milton . I had long been well acquainted with them , but I was particularly struck on that occasion by the dignified simplicity and majestic harmony that runs through most of them ,— in character so totally different from the Italian , and still more so from Shakespeare 's fine Sonnets . I took fire , if I may be allowed to say so , and produced three Sonnets the same afternoon , the first I ever wrote except an irregular one at school . Of these three , the only one I distinctly remember is “ I grieved for Buonaparte . ” One was never written down : the third , which was , I believe , preserved , I cannot particularise .— I .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 501 ]</span>This Sonnet , as Poetry , explains itself , yet the scene of the incident having been a wild wood , it may be doubted , as a point of natural history , whether the bird was aware that his attentions were bestowed upon a human , or even a living creature . But a Redbreast will perch upon the foot of a gardener at work , and alight on the handle of the spade when his hand is half upon it ,— this I have seen . And under my own roof I have witnessed affecting instances of the creature 's friendly visits to the chambers of sick persons , as described in the verses to the Redbreast . One of these welcome intruders used frequently to roost upon a nail in the wall , from which a picture had hung , and was ready , as morning came , to pipe his song in the hearing of the Invalid , who had been long confined to her room . These attachments to a particular person , when marked and continued , used to be reckoned ominous ; but the superstition is passing away .— W . W. 1827 .</p>

    <head>A JEWISH FAMILY</head>
    <head>( IN A SMALL VALLEY OPPOSITE ST. GOAR , UPON THE RHINE )</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1828 .— Published 1835</l>
   </lg>
   <note>Coleridge , my daughter , and I , in 1828 , passed a fortnight upon the banks of the Rhine , principally under the hospitable roof of Mr. Aders of Gotesburg , but two days of the time we spent at St. Goar in rambles among the neighbouring valleys . It was at St. Goar that I saw the Jewish family here described . Though exceedingly poor , and in rags , they were not less beautiful than I have endeavoured to make them appear . We had taken a little dinner with us in a basket , and invited them to partake of it , which the mother refused to do , both for herself and children , saying it was with them a fast-day ; adding , diffidently , that whether such observances were right or wrong , she felt it her duty to keep them strictly . The Jews , who are numerous on this part of the Rhine , greatly surpass the German peasantry in the beauty of their features and in the intelligence of their countenances . But the lower classes of the German peasantry have , here at least , the air of people grievously opprest . Nursing mothers , at the age of seven or eight-and-twenty , often look haggard and far more decayed and withered than women of Cumberland and Westmoreland twice their age . This comes from being under-fed and over-worked in their vineyards in a hot and glaring sun .— I . F .</note>

   <p>The title given to this poem by Dorothy Wordsworth , in the letter to Lady Beaumont in which the different MS. readings occur , is “ A Jewish Family , met with in a Dingle near the Rhine . ” During the Continental Tour of 1820 ,— in which Wordsworth was accompanied by his wife and sister and other friends ,— they went up the Rhine ( see the notes to the poems recording that Tour ) . An extract from Mrs. Wordsworth 's Journal , referring to the road from St. Goar to Bingen , may illustrate this poem , written in 1828 . “ From St. Goar to Bingen , castles commanding innumerable small fortified villages . Nothing could exceed the delightful variety , and at first the postilions whisked us too fast through these scenes ; and afterwards , the same variety so often repeated , we became quite exhausted , at least D. and I were ; and , beautiful as the road continued to be , we could scarcely keep our eyes open ; but , on my being roused from one of these slumbers , no eye wide-awake ever beheld such celestial pictures as gleamed before mine , like visions belonging to dreams . The castles seemed now almost stationary , a continued succession always in sight , rarely without two or three before us at once . There they rose from the craggy cliffs , out of the centre of the stately river , from a green island , or a craggy rock , etc ., etc . ”</p>
   <p>In Dorothy Wordsworth 's record of the same Tour , the following occurs :— “ July 24 .— We looked down into one of the vales tributary to the Rhine , which , in memory of the mountain recesses of Ullswater , I named Deep-dale , a green quiet place , spotted with villages and single houses , and enlivened by a sinuous brook . ” ... “ A lovely dell runs behind one of these hills . At its opening , where it pours out its stream into the Rhine , we espied a one-arched Borrowdale bridge ; and , behind the bridge , a village almost buried between the abruptly rising steeps . ” — ED .</p>

   <note>This occurred at Bruges in 1828 . Mr. Coleridge , my daughter , and I made a tour together in Flanders , upon the Rhine , and returned by Holland . Dora and I , while taking a walk along a retired part of the town , heard the voice as here described , and were afterwards informed it was a convent in which were many English .

   <p>In an undated letter of Dorothy Wordsworth 's to Lady Beaumont , before copying out this poem and A Jewish Family , she says , “ The two following poems were taken from incidents recorded in Dora 's journal of her tour with her father and S. T. Coleridge . As I well recollect , she has related the incidents very pleasingly , and I hope you will agree with me in thinking that the poet has made good use of them . ” — ED .</p>

     <l n="1">Composed December 1828 .— Published 1835</l>

   <note>Written at Rydal Mount . I have often regretted that my tour in Ireland , chiefly performed in the short days of October in a carriage-and-four ( I was with Mr. Marshall ) , supplied my memory with so few images that were new , and with so little motive to write . The lines however in this poem , “ Thou too be heard , lone eagle ! ” were suggested near the Giants ’ Causeway , or rather at the promontory of Fairhead , where a pair of eagles wheeled above our heads and darted off as if to hide themselves in a blaze of sky made by the setting sun .— I.

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 588 ]</span>The fundamental idea , both in the intellectual and moral philosophy of the Pythagoreans , was that of harmony or proportion . Their natural science or cosmology was dominated by the same idea , that as the world and all spheres within the universe were constructed symmetrically , and moved around a central focus , the forms and the proportions of things were best expressed by number . All good was due to the principle of order ; all evil to disorder . In accordance with the mathematical conception of the universe which ruled the Pythagoreans , justice was equality (# isotes #) , that is to say it consisted in each one receiving equally according to his deserts . Friendship too was equality of feeling and relationship ; harmony being the radical idea , alike in the ethics and in the cosmology of the school .— ED .</p>

   <note>They were a present from Miss Jewsbury , of whom mention is made in the note at the end of the next poem . The fish were healthy to all appearance in their confinement for a long time , but at last , for some cause we could not make out , they languished , and , one of them being all but dead , they were taken to the pool under the old pollard-oak . The apparently dying one lay on its side unable to move . I used to watch it , and about the tenth day it began to right itself , and in a few days more was able to swim about with its companions . For many months they continued to prosper in their new place of abode ; but one night by an unusually great flood they were swept out of the pool , and perished to our great regret .— I . F .</note>

It possessed the attraction , no small one to Horace , of being very secluded : yet , at the same time , within an easy distance of Rome . When his spirits wanted the stimulus of society or the bustle of the capital , which they often did , his ambling mule would speedily convey him thither ; and when jaded , on the other hand , by the noise and racket and dissipations of Rome , he could , in the same homely way , bury himself in a few hours among the hills , and there , under the shadow of his favourite Lucretilis , or by the banks of the clear-flowing and ice-cold Digentia , either stretch himself to dream upon the grass , lulled by the murmurs of the stream , or do a little farming in the way of clearing his fields of stones , or turning over a furrow here and there with the hoe . ” ( See Sir Theodore Martin 's Horace , p . 68 . ) — ED .</p>

   <note>This Lawn is the sloping one approaching the kitchen-garden , and was made out of it . Hundreds of times have I watched the dancing of shadows amid a press of sunshine , and other beautiful appearances of light and shade , flowers and shrubs . What a contrast between this and the cabbages and onions and carrots that used to grow there on a piece of ugly-shaped unsightly ground ! No reflection , however , either upon cabbages or onions ; the latter we know were worshipped by the Egyptians , and he must have a poor eye for beauty who has not observed how much of it there is in the form and colour which cabbages and plants of that genus exhibit through the various stages of their growth and decay . A richer display of colour in vegetable nature can scarcely be conceived than Coleridge , my sister , and I saw in a bed of potato-plants in blossom near a hut upon the moor between Inversneyd and Loch Katrine .<span type="note_anchor">[ 638 ]</span>These blossoms were of such extraordinary beauty and richness that no one could have passed them without notice . But the sense must be cultivated through the mind before we can perceive these inexhaustible treasures of Nature , for such they really are , without the least necessary reference to the utility of her productions , or even to the laws whereupon , as we learn by research , they are dependent . Some are of opinion that the habit of analysing , decomposing , and anatomising , is inevitably unfavourable to the perception of beauty . People are led into this mistake by overlooking the fact that such processes being to a certain extent within the reach of a limited intellect , we are apt to ascribe to them that insensibility of which they are in truth the effect and not the cause . Admiration and love , to which all knowledge truly vital must tend , are felt by men of real genius in proportion as their discoveries in natural Philosophy are enlarged ; and the beauty in form of a plant or an animal is not made less but more apparent as a whole by more accurate insight into its constituent properties and powers . A Savant who is not also a poet in soul and a religionist in heart is a feeble and unhappy creature .— I . F .</note>

The flowers were in very large bunches , and of an extraordinary size , and of every conceivable shade of colouring from snow-white to deep purple . It was pleasing in that place , where perhaps was never yet a flower cultivated by man for his own pleasure , to see these blossoms grow more gladly than elsewhere , making a summer garden near the mountain dwellings . ” ( Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland in 1803 , p. 85 ) .— ED .</head>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 644 ]</span>Mr. T. W. Shore ( Southampton ) , writes to me : “ The two trees referred to by the poet are still on the hill , and called the Shore Trees . The family of Shore is an ancient one in Derbyshire , extending back to the reign of Richard II . In the time of Charles I , several members of the family impoverished themselves in support of the Royalist cause .... The trees on Oker Hill are supposed to have been planted by those who remembered the family misfortunes , or who succeeded the family which took part in the 17th century struggle . ” — ED .</p>

    <head>THE EGYPTIAN MAID</head>
    <head>OR , THE ROMANCE OF THE WATER LILY</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1830 .— Published 1835</l>
   </lg>
   <p>For the names and persons in the following poem , see the “ History of the renowned Prince Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table ” ; for the rest the Author is answerable ; only it may be proper to add , that the Lotus , with the bust of the Goddess appearing to rise out of the full-blown flower , was suggested by the beautiful work of ancient art , once included among the Townley Marbles , and now in the British Museum .— W . W. 1835 .</p>
   <note>In addition to the short notice prefixed to this poem , it may be worth while here to say , that it rose out of a few words casually used in conversation by my nephew , Henry Hutchinson . He was describing with great spirit the appearance and movement of a vessel which he seemed to admire more than any other he had ever seen , and said her name was the Water Lily . This plant has been my delight from my boyhood , as I have seen it floating on the lake ; and that conversation put me upon constructing and composing the poem . Had I not heard those words , it would never have been written . The form of the stanza is new , and is nothing but a repetition of the first five lines as they were thrown off , and is not perhaps well suited to narrative , and certainly would not have been trusted to had I thought at the beginning that the poem would have gone to such a length .— I . F .</note>
   <p>In the editions of 1835 and 1837 this poem was assigned a place of its own . In 1845 it was placed among the “ Memorials of a Tour in Italy , 1837 . ” — ED .</p>

This dove was one of a pair that had been given to my daughter by our excellent friend , Miss Jewsbury ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 673 ]</span>who went to India with her husband , Mr. Fletcher , where she died of cholera . The dove survived its mate many years , and was killed , to our great sorrow , by a neighbour 's cat that got in at the window and dragged it partly out of the cage . These verses were composed extempore , to the letter , in the Terrace Summer-house before spoken of . It was the habit of the bird to begin cooing and murmuring whenever it heard me making my verses .— I. F .</note>

   <p>[ I have reason to remember the day that gave rise to this Sonnet , the 6th of November , 1830 . Having undertaken , a great feat for me , to ride my daughter 's pony from Westmoreland to Cambridge , that she might have the use of it while on a visit to her uncle at Trinity Lodge , on my way from Bakewell to Matlock I turned aside to Chatsworth , and had scarcely gratified my curiosity by the sight of that celebrated place before there came on a severe storm of wind and rain which continued till I reached Derby , both man and pony in a pitiable plight . For myself , I went to bed at noon-day . In the course of that journey I had to encounter a storm worse if possible , in which the pony could ( or would ) only make his way slantwise .</p>
   <p>I mention this merely to add that notwithstanding this battering I composed , on horseback , the lines to the memory of Sir George Beaumont , suggested during my recent visit to Coleorton .— I. F . ]</p>

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 689 ]</span>Haydon , as he tells us in his Autobiography , received a commission from Sir Robert Peel , in December 1830 , “ to paint Napoleon musing , the size of life . ” He finished it in June 1831 , and thus described it himself :—</p>
   <p>“ Napoleon was peculiarly alive to poetical association as produced by scenery or sound ; village bells with their echoing ding , dong , dang , now bursting full on the ear , now dying in the wind , affected him as they affect everybody alive to natural impressions , and on the eve of all his great battles you find him stealing away in the dead of the night , between the two hosts , and indulging in every species of poetical reverie . It was impossible to think of such a genius in captivity , without mysterious associations of the sky , the sea , the rock , and the solitude with which he was enveloped . I never imagined him but as if musing at dawn , or melancholy at sunset , listening at midnight to the beating and roaring of the Atlantic , or meditating as the stars gazed and the moon shone on him ; in short Napoleon never appeared to me but at those seasons of silence and twilight , when nature seems to sympathise with the fallen , and when if there be moments in this turbulent earth fit for celestial intercourse , one must imagine these would be the times immortal spirits might select to descend within the sphere of mortality , to soothe and comfort , to inspire and support the afflicted .</p>
   <p>“ Under such impressions the present picture was produced .... I imagined him standing on the brow of an impending cliff , and musing on his past fortunes , ... sea-birds screaming at his feet , ... the sun just down , ... the sails of his guard-ship glittering on the horizon , and the Atlantic , calm , silent , awfully deep , and endlessly extensive . ” — Life of Benjamin Robert Haydon , vol . ii . pp . 301 , 302 .</p>

   <note>In the autumn of 1831 , my daughter and I set off from Rydal to visit Sir Walter Scott before his departure for Italy . This journey had been delayed by an inflammation in my eyes till we found that the time appointed for his leaving home would be too near for him to receive us without considerable inconvenience . Nevertheless we proceeded and reached Abbotsford on Monday . I was then scarcely able to lift up my eyes to the light . How sadly changed did I find him from the man I had seen so healthy , gay , and hopeful , a few years before , when he said at the inn at Paterdale , in my presence , his daughter Anne also being there , with Mr. Lockhart , my own wife and daughter , and Mr. Quillinan ,— “ I mean to live till I am eighty , and I shall write as long as I live . ” But to return to Abbotsford : the inmates and guests we found there were Sir Walter , Major Scott , Anne Scott , and Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart , Mr. Liddell , his Lady and Brother , and Mr. Allan the painter , and Mr. Laidlaw , a very old friend of Sir Walter 's . One of Burns 's sons , an officer in the Indian service , had left the house a day or two before , and had kindly expressed his regret that he could not wait my arrival , a regret that I may truly say was mutual . In the evening , Mr. and Mrs. Liddell sang , and Mrs. Lockhart chanted old ballads to her harp ; and Mr. Allan , hanging over the back of a chair , told and acted old stories in a humorous way . With this exhibition and his daughter 's singing , Sir Walter was much amused , as indeed were we all as far as circumstances would allow . But what is most worthy of mention is the admirable demeanour of Major Scott during the following evening when the Liddells were gone and only ourselves and Mr. Allan were present . He had much to suffer from the sight of his father 's infirmities and from the great change that was about to take place at the residence he had built , and where he had long lived in so much prosperity and happiness . But what struck me most was the patient kindness with which he supported himself under the many fretful expressions that his sister Anne addressed to him or uttered in his hearing . She , poor thing , as mistress of that house , had been subject , after her mother 's death , to a heavier load of care and responsibility and greater sacrifices of time than one of such a constitution of body and mind was able to bear . Of this , Dora and I were made so sensible , that , as soon as we had crossed the Tweed on our departure , we gave vent at the same moment to our apprehensions that her brain would fail and she would go out of her mind , or that she would sink under the trials she had passed and those which awaited her . On Tuesday morning Sir Walter Scott accompanied us and most of the party to Newark Castle on the Yarrow . When we alighted from the carriages he walked pretty stoutly , and had great pleasure in revisiting those his favourite haunts . Of that excursion the verses Yarrow Revisited are a memorial . Notwithstanding the romance that pervades Sir Walter 's works and attaches to many of his habits , there is too much pressure of fact for these verses to harmonise as much as I could wish with other poems . On our return in the afternoon we had to cross the Tweed directly opposite Abbotsford . The wheels of our carriage grated upon the pebbles in the bed of the stream that there flows somewhat rapidly : a rich but sad light of rather a purple than a golden hue was spread over the Eildon Hills at that moment ; and , thinking it probable that it might be the last time Sir Walter would cross the stream , I was not a little moved , and expressed some of my feelings in the Sonnet beginning — “ A trouble , not of clouds , or weeping rain . ” At noon on Thursday we left Abbotsford , and in the morning of that day Sir Walter and I had a serious conversation tete-a-tete , when he spoke with gratitude of the happy life which upon the whole he had led . He had written in my daughter 's Album , before he came into the breakfast-room that morning , a few stanzas addressed to her , and , while putting the book into her hand , in his own study , standing by his desk , he said to her in my presence — “ I should not have done anything of this kind but for your father 's sake : they are probably the last verses I shall ever write . ” They show how much his mind was impaired , not by the strain of thought but by the execution , some of the lines being imperfect , and one stanza wanting corresponding rhymes : one letter , the initial S , had been omitted in the spelling of his own name . In this interview also it was that , upon my expressing a hope of his health being benefited by the climate of the country to which he was going , and by the interest he would take in the classic remembrances of Italy , he made use of the quotation from Yarrow Unvisited as recorded by me in the Musings of Aquapendente six years afterwards . Mr. Lockhart has mentioned in his life of him what I heard from several quarters while abroad , both at Rome and elsewhere , that little seemed to interest him but what he could collect or hear of the fugitive Stuarts and their adherents who had followed them into exile . Both the Yarrow Revisited and the “ Sonnet ” were sent him before his departure from England . Some further particulars of the conversations which occurred during this visit I should have set down had they not been already accurately recorded by Mr. Lockhart . I first became acquainted with this great and amiable man — Sir Walter Scott — in the year 1803 , when my sister and I , making a tour in Scotland , were hospitably received by him in Lasswade upon the banks of the Esk , where he was then living . We saw a good deal of him in the course of the following week ; the particulars are given in my sister 's Journal of that tour .— I. F .</note>

   </lg>
   <p>With the closing lines of this sonnet addressed to the “ winds of ocean , ” and Sir Walter 's departure for Naples , compare Horace 's ode to the Ship carrying Virgil to Athens ( Odes , I . 3 ) .</p>
   <p>On the 19th October 1833 , Henry Crabb Robinson wrote thus to his friend Masquerier — “ It is , I think , the most perfect sonnet in the language . Every word is a gem , from the ‘ pathetic light ’ in the second to the ‘ soft Parthenope ’ in the last line . It is composed with that deep feeling and perfection of style united that bespeak the master . ” ( Diary , Reminiscences , etc ., vol . iii . p . 32 . )</p>
   <p>The sonnet was sent to Alaric Watts for his Souvenir in 1832 . Wordsworth wrote , “ I enclose a sonnet for your next volume if you choose to insert it . It would have appeared with more advantage in this year 's , but was not written in time . It is proper that I should mention it has been sent to Sir Walter Scott , and one or two of my other friends . ” ( See Alaric Watts , a Narrative of his Life , vol . ii . p . 190 . ) — ED .</p>

    <head>A PLACE OF BURIAL IN THE SOUTH OF SCOTLAND</head>
    <note>Similar places for burial are not unfrequent in Scotland . The one that suggested this sonnet lies on the banks of a small stream called the Wauchope that flows into the Esk near Langholme . Mickle , who , as it appears from his poem on Sir Martin , was not without genuine poetic feelings , was born and passed his boyhood in this neighbourhood , under his father who was a minister of the Scotch Kirk . The Esk , both above and below Langholme , flows through a beautiful country , and the two streams of the Wauchope and the Ewes , which join it near that place , are such as a pastoral poet would delight in .— I.

    <head>ON THE SIGHT OF A MANSE IN THE SOUTH OF SCOTLAND</head>
    <note>The Manses in Scotland and the gardens and grounds about them have seldom that attractive appearance which is common about our English parsonages , even when the clergyman 's income falls below the average of the Scotch minister 's . This is not merely owing to the one country being poor in comparison with the other , but arises rather out of the equality of their benefices , so that no one has enough to spare for decorations that might serve as an example for others ; whereas , with us , the taste of the richer incumbent extends its influence more or less to the poorest . After all , in these observations the surface only of the matter is touched . I once heard a conversation in which the Roman Catholic Religion was decried on account of its abuses . “ You cannot deny , however , ” said a lady of the party , repeating an expression used by Charles II ., “ that it is the religion of a gentleman . ” It may be left to the Scotch themselves to determine how far this observation applies to their Kirk , while it cannot be denied , if it is wanting in that characteristic quality , the aspect of common life , so far as concerns its beauty , must suffer . Sincere christian piety may be thought not to stand in need of refinement or studied ornament ; but assuredly it is ever ready to adopt them , when they fall within its notice , as means allow ; and this observation applies not only to manners , but to everything a christian ( truly so in spirit ) cultivates and gathers round him , however humble his social condition .— I.

    <head>COMPOSED IN ROSLIN CHAPEL , DURING A STORM</head>
    <note>We were detained by incessant rain and storm at the small inn near Roslin Chapel , and I passed a great part of the day pacing to and fro in this beautiful structure , which , though not used for public service , is not allowed to go to ruin . Here , this sonnet was composed . If it has at all done justice to the feeling which the place and the storm raging without inspired , I was as a prisoner . A painter delineating the interior of the chapel and its minute features under such circumstances would have , no doubt , found his time agreeably shortened . But the movements of the mind must be more free while dealing with words than with lines and colours ; such at least was then and has been on many other occasions my belief , and , as it is allotted to few to follow both arts with success , I am grateful to my own calling for this and a thousand other recommendations which are denied to that of the painter .— I .

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 714 ]</span>This sonnet describes the exterior of a Highland hut , as often seen under morning or evening sunshine . To the authoress of the Address to the Wind , and other poems , in these volumes , who was my fellow-traveller in this tour , I am indebted for the following extract from her journal , which<span type="note_anchor">[ 715 ]</span>accurately describes , under particular circumstances , the beautiful appearance of the interior of one of these rude habitations .</p>
   <p>“ On our return from the Trosachs the evening began to darken , and it rained so heavily that we were completely wet before we had come two miles , and it was dark when we landed with our boatman , at his hut upon the banks of Loch Katrine . I was faint from cold : the good woman had provided , according to her promise , a better fire than we had found in the morning ; and , indeed , when I sat down in the chimney-corner of her smoky biggin , I thought I had never felt more comfortable in my life : a pan of coffee was boiling for us , and , having put our clothes in the way of drying , we all sat down thankful for a shelter . We could not prevail upon our boatman , the master of the house , to draw near the fire , though he was cold and wet , or to suffer his wife to get him dry clothes till she had served us , which she did most willingly , though not very expeditiously .</p>
   <p>“ A Cumberland man of the same rank would not have had such a notion of what was fit and right in his own house , or , if he had , one would have accused him of servility ; but in the Highlander it only seemed like politeness ( however erroneous and painful to us ) , naturally growing out of the dependence of the inferiors of the clan upon their laird ; he did not , however , refuse to let his wife bring out the whisky bottle for his refreshment , at our request . ‘ She keeps a dram , ’ as the phrase is : indeed , I believe there is scarcely a lonely house by the way-side , in Scotland , where travellers may not be accommodated with a dram . We asked for sugar , butter , barley-bread , and milk ; and , with a smile and a stare more of kindness than wonder , she replied , ‘ Ye 'll get that , ’ bringing each article separately . We caroused our cups of coffee , laughing like children at the strange atmosphere in which we were : the smoke came in gusts , and spread along the walls ; and above our heads in the chimney ( where the hens were roosting ) it appeared like clouds<span type="note_anchor">[ 716 ]</span>in the sky . We laughed and laughed again , in spite of the smarting of our eyes , yet had a quieter pleasure in observing the beauty of the beams and rafters gleaming between the clouds of smoke : they had been crusted over , and varnished by many winters , till , where the firelight fell upon them , they had become as glossy as black rocks , on a sunny day , cased in ice . When we had eaten our supper we sat about half an hour , and I think I never felt so deeply the blessing of a hospitable welcome and a warm fire . The man of the house repeated from time to time that we should often tell of this night when we got to our homes , and interposed praises of his own lake , which he had more than once , when we were returning in the boat , ventured to say was ‘ bonnier than Loch Lomond . ’ Our companion from the Trosachs , who , it appeared , was an Edinburgh drawing-master going , during the vacation , on a pedestrian tour to John o ’ Groat 's house , was to sleep in the barn with my fellow-travellers , where the man said he had plenty of dry hay . I do not believe that the hay of the Highlands is ever very dry , but this year it had a better chance than usual : wet or dry , however , the next morning they said they had slept comfortably . When I went to bed , the mistress , desiring me to ‘ go ben , ’ attended me with a candle , and assured me that the bed was dry , though not ‘ sic as I had been used to . ’ It was of chaff ; there were two others in the room , a cupboard and two chests , upon one of which stood milk in wooden vessels , covered over . The walls of the house were of stone unplastered : it consisted of three apartments , the cowhouse at one end , the kitchen or house in the middle , and the spence at the other end ; the rooms were divided , not up to the rigging , but only to the beginning of the roof , so that there was a free passage for light and smoke from one end of the house to the other . I went to bed some time before the rest of the family ; the door was shut between us , and they had a bright fire , which I could not see , but the light it sent up amongst<span type="note_anchor">[ 717 ]</span>the varnished rafters and beams , which crossed each other in almost as intricate and fantastic a manner as I have seen the under-boughs of a large beech tree withered by the depth of shade above , produced the most beautiful effect that can be conceived . It was like what I should suppose an under-ground cave or temple to be , with a dripping or moist roof , and the moonlight entering in upon it by some means or other : and yet the colours were more like those of melted gems . I lay looking up till the light of the fire faded away , and the man and his wife and child had crept into their bed at the other end of the room : I did not sleep much , but passed a comfortable night ; for my bed , though hard , was warm and clean : the unusualness of my situation prevented me from sleeping . I could hear the waves beat against the shore of the lake : a little rill close to the door made a much louder noise , and , when I sat up in my bed , I could see the lake through an open window-place at the bed 's head . Add to this , it rained all night . I was less occupied by remembrance of the Trosachs , beautiful as they were , than the vision of the Highland hut , which I could not get out of my head ; I thought of the Faery-land of Spenser , and what I had read in romance at other times ; and then what a feast it would be for a London Pantomime-maker could he but transplant it to Drury-lane , with all its beautiful colours ! ” — MS.

    <head>THE BROWNIE</head>
    <head>Upon a small island not far from the head of Loch Lomond , are some remains of an ancient building , which was for several years the abode of a solitary Individual , one of the last survivors of the clan of Macfarlane , once powerful in that neighbourhood . Passing along the shore opposite this island in the year 1814 , the Author learned these particulars , and that this person then living there had acquired the appellation of “ The Brownie . ” See The Brownie 's Cell ( vol . vi . p. 16 ) , to which the following<span type="note_anchor">[ 718 ]</span>is a sequel .— W .

     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 719 ]</span>The following is from the same MS ., and gives an account of the</l>
     <l n="2">visit to Bothwell Castle here alluded to :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ It was exceedingly delightful to enter thus unexpectedly upon such a beautiful region . The castle stands nobly , overlooking the Clyde . When we came up to it , I was hurt to see that flower-borders had taken place of the natural overgrowings of the ruin , the scattered stones and wild plants . It is a large and grand pile of red freestone , harmonising perfectly with the rocks of the river , from which , no doubt , it has been hewn . When I was a little accustomed to the unnaturalness of a modern garden , I could not help admiring the excessive beauty and luxuriance of some of the plants , particularly the purple-flowered clematis , and a broad-leafed creeping plant without flowers , which scrambled up the castle wall , along with the ivy , and spread its vine-like branches so lavishly that it seemed to be in its natural situation , and one could not help thinking that , though not self-planted among the ruins of this country , it must somewhere have its native abode in such places . If Bothwell Castle had not been close to the Douglas mansion , we should have been disgusted with the possessor 's miserable conception of adorning such a venerable ruin ; but it is so very near to the house , that of necessity the pleasure-grounds must have extended beyond it , and perhaps the neatness of a shaven lawn and the complete desolation natural to a ruin might have made an unpleasing contrast ; and , besides being within the precincts of the pleasure-grounds , and so very near to the dwelling of a noble family , it has forfeited , in some degree , its independent majesty , and becomes a tributary to the mansion : its solitude being interrupted , it has no longer the command over the mind in sending it back into past times , or excluding the ordinary feelings which we bear about us in daily life . We had then only to regret that the castle and the house were so near to each other ; and it was impossible not to regret it ; for the ruin presides in state over the river , far from city or town , as if it might have a peculiar privilege to preserve its memorials of past ages , and maintain its own character for centuries to come . We sat upon a bench under the high trees , and had beautiful views of the different reaches of the river , above and below . On the opposite bank , which is finely wooded with elms and other trees , are the remains of a priory built upon a rock ; and rock and ruin are so blended , that it is impossible to separate the one from the other . Nothing can be more beautiful than the little remnant of this holy place : elm trees ( for we were near enough to distinguish them by their branches ) grow out of the walls , and overshadow a small , but very elegant window . It can scarcely be conceived what a grace the castle and priory impart to each other ; and the river Clyde flows on , smooth and unruffled below , seeming to my thoughts more in harmony with the sober and stately images of former times , than if it had roared over a rocky channel , forcing its sound upon the ear . It blended gently with the warbling of the smaller birds , and the chattering of the larger ones , that had made their nests in the ruins . In this fortress the chief of the English nobility were confined after the battle of Bannockburn . If a man is to be a prisoner , he scarcely could have a more pleasant place to solace his captivity ; but I thought that , for close confinement , I should prefer the banks of a lake , or the seaside . The greatest charm of a brook or river is in the liberty to pursue it through its windings : you can then take it in whatever mood you like ; silent or noisy , sportive or quiet . The beauties of a brook or river must be sought , and the pleasure is in going in search of them ; those of a lake or of the sea come to you of themselves . These rude warriors cared little , perhaps , about either ; and yet , if one may judge from the writings of Chaucer , and from the old romances , more interesting passions were connected with natural objects in the days of chivalry than now ; though going in search of scenery , as it is called , had not then been thought of . I had previously heard nothing of Bothwell Castle , at least nothing that I remembered ; therefore , perhaps , my pleasure was greater , compared with what I received elsewhere , than others might feel . ” — MS .

   <p>“ On September the 29th , from Lanark I visited the Duke of Hamilton 's palace , and had unusual pleasure in the paintings to be seen there . I venture to copy my remarks on the famous Rubens ’ ‘ Daniel in the Lions ’ Den : ’ — ‘ The variety of character in the lions is admirable . Here is indignation at the unintelligible power which restrains them ; there reverence towards the being whom they dare not touch . One of them is consoled by the contemplation of the last skull he has been picking ; one is anticipating his next meal ; two are debating the subject together . But the Prophet , with a face resembling Curran 's ( foreshortened so as to lose its best expression ) , has all the muscles of his countenance strained from extreme terror . He is without joy or hope ; and though his doom is postponed , he has no faith in the miracle which is to reward his integrity . It is a painting rather to astonish than delight . ’ ”</p>
   <p>In a footnote Robinson adds , “ Daniel 's head is thrown back , and he looks upwards with an earnest expression and clasped hands , as if vehemently supplicating . The picture formerly belonged to King Charles I . It was at that time entered as follows in the Catalogue of the Royal Pictures :— ‘ A piece of Daniel in the Lions ’ Den with lions about him , given by the deceased Lord Dorchester to the king , being so big as the life . Done by Sir Peter Paul Rubens . ’ Dr. Waagen very justly observes that , upon the whole , the figure of Daniel is only an accessory employed by the great master to introduce , in the most perfect form , nine figures of lions and lionesses the size of life . Rubens , in a letter to Sir Dudley Carleton ( who presented the picture to the king ) , dated April 28th , 1618 , expressly states that it was wholly his own workmanship . The price was six hundred florins . Engraved in mezzotint by W. Ward , 1789 . ”</p>
   <p>This famous picture , after having been in the possession of the Duke of Hamilton , was sold — in 1882 — to Mr. Denison , Yorkshire . The following is from the catalogue of the Hamilton Palace sale :—</p>
   <p>RUBENS — DANIEL IN THE DEN OF LIONS .— The prophet is represented sitting naked in the middle of the den , his hands clasped , and his countenance directed upward with an expression of earnest prayer . Nine lions are prowling around him . Engraved by Blooteling , Van der Leuw , and Lamb , and in mezzotint by J . Ward . There is also an etching of it by Street , extremely rare . This is one of the few great pictures by Rubens which we know with certainty to have been entirely executed by his own hand . Rubens says this explicitly in an Italian letter to Sir Dudley Carleton , which Mr. Carpenter has printed in his Pictorial Notices , p. 140 . This picture was presented by Sir Dudley Carleton to Charles I ., and is inserted in the printed catalogue of his collection at page 87 .</p>

   <p>I am indebted to Dr. Taylor of Penrith for the following note in reference to these “ Roman Antiquities ” at Old Penrith :— “ I have great pleasure in giving you what information I can , concerning the Roman Station of Old Penrith . It is called ‘ Petriana ’ by Camden , but most archaeologists now allocate it in the ‘ 2nd Iter , ’ as the Station ‘ Voreda ’ — on the road between York and Carlisle . This road passes over Stanemoor , by Bowes , Brough , Kirkbythore , Brougham , and Plumpton Wall ( or Voreda ) , to Lugovallum or Carlisle . The Roman Camps are visible at all these places , and the old Roman road is recognisable in many parts . This Old Penrith , Plumpton Wall , or Voreda , is a camp of the third class . At a time , probably about the period which Wordsworth alludes to , several Roman stones and altars were dug up at Voreda , and are now deposited in Lowther Castle . Wordsworth had relations living in Penrith , whom he used to visit occasionally , and it is probable that after a visit to Voreda , which is about six miles from here , he wrote the Sonnet alluded to . The ‘ Hart-horn Tree ’ referred to in the ‘ Legend of the Hunt of the Stag ’ stood in the park of Whinfell , in the parish of Brougham , but has disappeared for many years . ” — ED .</p>

   <p>THE HIGHLAND BROACH</p>
   <p>The exact resemblance which the old Broach ( still in use , though rarely met with , among the Highlanders ) bears to the Roman Fibula must strike every one , and concurs , with the plaid and kilt , to recall to mind the communication which the ancient Romans had with this remote country .— W . W. 1835 .</p>
   <note>On ascending a hill that leads from Loch Awe towards Inverary , I fell into conversation with a woman of the humbler class who wore one of those Highland Broaches . I talked with her about it ; and upon parting with her , when I said with a kindness I truly felt — “ May that Broach continue in your family through many generations to come , as you have already possessed it ” — she thanked me most becomingly and seemed not a little moved .— I.

She had had an opportunity of benefiting a poor old woman in her own hut , who , wishing to make a return , said to her daughter in Erse , in a tone of plaintive earnestness , “ I would give anything I have , but I hope she does not wish for my Broach ! ” and , uttering these words , she put her hand upon the Broach which fastened her kerchief , and which , she imagined , had attracted the eye of her benefactress .— W .

     <l n="26">Nor does the village Church-clock 's iron tone 10</l>

     <l n="28">Nine beats distinctly to each other bound</l>
     <l n="29">In drowsy sequence — how unlike the sound</l>
     <l n="30">That , in rough winter , oft inflicts a fear</l>
     <l n="31">On fireside listeners , doubting what they hear ! 15</l>
     <l n="32">The shepherd , bent on rising with the sun ,</l>
     <l n="33">Had closed his door before the day was done ,</l>
     <l n="34">And now with thankful heart to bed doth creep ,</l>
     <l n="35">And joins<span type="note_anchor">[ 748 ]</span>his little children in their sleep .</l>
     <l n="36">The bat , lured forth where trees the lane o'ershade , 20</l>
     <l n="37">Flits and reflits along the close arcade ;</l>
     <l n="38">The busy<span type="note_anchor">[ 749 ]</span>dor-hawk chases the white moth</l>
     <l n="39">With burring note , which Industry and Sloth</l>
     <l n="40">Might both be pleased with , for it suits them both .</l>
     <l n="41">A stream is heard — I see it not , but know 25</l>
     <l n="42">By its soft music whence the waters flow :</l>
     <l n="43">Wheels<span type="note_anchor">[ 750 ]</span>and the tread of hoofs are heard no more ;</l>
     <l n="44">One boat there was , but it will touch the shore</l>
     <l n="45">With the next dipping of its slackened oar ;</l>
     <l n="46">Faint sound , that , for the gayest of the gay , 30</l>
     <l n="47">Might give to serious thought a moment 's sway ,</l>
     <l n="48">As a last token of man 's toilsome day !</l>

   <note>The lines were composed on the road between Moresby and Whitehaven while I was on a visit to my son , then rector of the former place . This succession of Voluntaries , with the exception of the 8th and 9th , originated in the concluding lines of the last paragraph of this poem . With this coast I have been familiar from my earliest childhood , and remember being struck for the first time by the town and port of Whitehaven and the white waves breaking against its quays and piers , as the whole came into view from the top of the high ground down which the road ( it has since been altered ) then descended abruptly . My sister , when she first heard the voice of the sea from this point , and beheld the scene before her , burst into tears . Our family then lived at Cockermouth , and this fact was often mentioned among us as indicating the sensibility for which she was so remarkable .— I . F .</note>

   <note>These lines were suggested during my residence under my son 's roof at Moresby , on the coast near Whitehaven , at the time when I was composing those verses among the “ Evening Voluntaries ” that have reference to the sea . It was in that neighbourhood I first became acquainted with the ocean and its appearances and movements . My infancy and early childhood were passed at Cockermouth , about eight miles from the coast , and I well remember that mysterious awe with which I used to listen to anything said about storms and shipwrecks . Sea-shells of many descriptions were common in the town ; and I was not a little surprised when I heard that Mr. Landor<span type="note_anchor">[ 790 ]</span>had denounced me as a plagiarist from himself for having described a boy applying a sea-shell to his ear and listening to it for intimations of what was going on in its native element . This I had done myself scores of times , and it was a belief among us that we could know from the sound whether the tide was ebbing or flowing .— I. F .</note>

The course pursued was down the Cumberland river Derwent , and to Whitehaven ; thence ( by the Isle of Man , where a few days were passed ) up the Frith of Clyde to Greenock , then to Oban , Staffa , Iona ; and back towards England by Loch Awe , Inverary , Loch Goilhead , Greenock , and through parts of Renfrewshire , Ayrshire , and Dumfries-shire to Carlisle , and thence up the river Eden , and homewards by Ullswater .— W .

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 798 ]</span>Many years ago , when I was at Greta Bridge , in Yorkshire , the hostess of the inn , proud of her skill in etymology , said , that “ the name of the river was taken from the bridge , the form of which , as every one must notice , exactly resembled a great A . ” Dr. Whitaker has derived it from the word of common occurrence in the North of England , “ to greet ; ” signifying to lament aloud , mostly with weeping : a conjecture rendered more probable from the stony and rocky channel of both the Cumberland and Yorkshire rivers . The Cumberland Greta , though it does not , among the country people , take up that name till within three miles of its disappearance in the River Derwent , may be considered as having its source in the mountain cove of Wythburn , and flowing through Thirlmere , the beautiful features of which lake are known only to those who , travelling between Grasmere and Keswick , have quitted the main road in the vale of Wythburn , and , crossing over to the opposite side of the lake , have proceeded with it on the right hand .</p>
   <p>The channel of the Greta , immediately above Keswick , has , for the purposes of building , been in a great measure cleared of the immense stones which , by their concussion in high floods , produced the loud and awful noises described in the sonnet .</p>
   <p>“ The scenery upon this river , ” says Mr. Southey in his Colloquies , “ where it passes under the woody side of Latrigg , is of the finest and most rememberable kind :—</p>

    <head>NUN 'S WELL , BRIGHAM</head>
    <note>So named from the religious House that stood close by . I have rather an odd anecdote to relate of the Nun 's Well . One day the landlady of a public-house , a field 's length from the well , on the roadside , said to me — “ You have been to see the Nun 's Well , Sir ? ” “ The Nun 's Well ! what is that ? ” said the Postman , who in his royal livery stopt his mail-car at the door . The landlady and I explained to him what the name meant , and what sort of people the nuns were . A countryman who was standing by , rather tipsy , stammered out — “ Aye , those nuns were good people ; they are gone ; but we shall soon have them back again . ” The Reform mania was just then at its height .— I.

   <note>I will mention for the sake of the friend who is writing down these notes , that it was among the fine Scotch firs near Ambleside , and particularly those near Green Bank , that I have over and over again paused at the sight of this image . Long may they stand to afford a like gratification to others !— This wish is not uncalled for , several of their brethren having already disappeared .— I . F .</note>

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 818 ]</span>St . Bees ’ Heads , anciently called the Cliff of Baruth , are a conspicuous sea-mark for all vessels sailing in the N. E . parts of the Irish Sea . In a bay , one side of which is formed by the southern headland , stands the village of St . Bees ; a place distinguished , from very early times , for its religious and scholastic foundations .</p>
   <p>“ St . Bees , ” say Nicholson and Burns , “ had its name from Bega , an holy woman from Ireland , who is said to have founded here , about the year of our Lord 650 , a small monastery , where afterwards a church was built in memory of her .</p>
   <p>“ The aforesaid religious house , being destroyed by the Danes , was restored by William de Meschiens , son of Ranulph , and brother of Ranulph de Meschiens , first Earl of Cumberland after the Conquest ; and made a cell of a prior and six Benedictine monks to the Abbey of St. Mary at York . ”</p>
   <p>Several traditions of miracles , connected with the foundation of the first of these religious houses , survive among the people of the neighbourhood ; one of which is alluded to in these Stanzas ; and another , of a somewhat bolder and more peculiar character , has furnished the subject of a spirited poem by the Rev . R. Parkinson , M. A ., late Divinity Lecturer of St . Bees ’ College , and now Fellow of the Collegiate Church of Manchester .</p>
   <p>After the dissolution of the monasteries , Archbishop Grindal founded a free school at St . Bees , from which the counties of Cumberland and Westmoreland have derived great benefit ; and recently , under the patronage of the Earl of Lonsdale , a college has been established there for the education of ministers for the English Church . The old Conventual Church has been repaired under the superintendence of the Rev . Dr. Ainger , the Head of the College ; and is well worthy of being visited by any strangers who might be led to the neighbourhood of this celebrated spot .</p>
   <p>The form of stanza in this Poem , and something in the style of versification , are adopted from the St. Monica , a poem of much beauty upon a monastic subject , by Charlotte Smith : a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered . She wrote little , and that little unambitiously , but with true feeling for rural nature ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 839 ]</span>at a time when nature was not much regarded by English Poets ; for in point of time her earlier writings preceded , I believe , those of Cowper and Burns .<span type="note_anchor">[ 840 ]</span>— W.

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 828 ]</span>I am aware that I am here treading upon tender ground ; but to the intelligent reader I feel that<span type="note_anchor">[ 841 ]</span>no apology is due . The prayers of survivors , during passionate grief for the recent loss of relatives and friends , as the object of those prayers could no longer be the suffering body of the dying , would naturally be ejaculated for the souls of the departed ; the barriers between the two worlds dissolving before the power of love and faith . The ministers of religion , from their habitual attendance upon sick-beds , would be daily witnesses of these benign results ; and hence would be strongly tempted to aim at giving to them permanence , by embodying them in rites and ceremonies , recurring at stated periods . All this , as it was in course of nature , so was it blameless , and even praiseworthy ; since some of its effects , in that rude state of society , could not but be salutary . No reflecting person , however , can view<span type="note_anchor">[ 842 ]</span>without sorrow the abuses which rose out of thus formalizing sublime instincts , and disinterested movements of passion , and perverting them into means of gratifying the ambition and rapacity of the priesthood . But , while we deplore and are indignant at these abuses , it would be a great mistake if we imputed the origin of the offices to prospective selfishness on the part of the monks and clergy : they were at first sincere in their sympathy , and in their degree dupes rather of their own creed , than artful and designing men . Charity is , upon the whole , the safest guide that we can take in judging our fellow-men , whether of past ages , or of the present time .— W . W. 1835 .</p>

Robinson 's letters on the Italian Tour of 1837 :— “ This reminds me that I was once privy to the conception of a Sonnet with a distinctness which did not once occur on the longer Italian journey . This was when I accompanied him into the Isle of Man . We had been drinking tea with Mr. and Mrs. Cookson , and left them when the weather was dull . Very soon after leaving them we passed the Church Tower of Bala-Sala . The upper part of the tower had a sort of frieze of yellow lichens . Mr. W.

    <note>Mr. Robinson and I walked the greater part of the way from Castle-town to Piel , and stopped some time at Tynwald Hill . One of my companions was an elderly man who , in a muddy way ( for he was tipsy ) , explained and answered , as far as he could , my enquiries about this place and the ceremonies held here . I found more agreeable company in some little children ; one of them , upon my request , recited the Lord 's Prayer to me , and I helped her to a clearer understanding of it as well as I could ; but I was not at all satisfied with my own part ; hers was much better done , and I am persuaded that , like other children , she knew more about it than she was able to express , especially to a stranger .— I .

   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 871 ]</span>The ground at Tynwald Hill ( as it is called ) remains unchanged . Here , on a small plot of ground , the whole Manx people meet annually on Midsummer Day , July 5th , to appoint officers and enact new laws . The first historical notice of these meetings is in 1417 . The name Tynwald is derived from the Scandinavian thing , “ court of justice , ” and wald , “ fenced . ” The mound is only 12 feet high , rising by four circular platforms , each 3 feet higher than the one below it . The circumference at the base is 240 feet , and at the top 18 feet . It used once to be walled round , and had two gates . The approach now is by twenty-one steps cut in the turf .</p>

As soon as ever I looked upon them , they called forth the sad representation of all the sins and all the miseries that had overwhelmed them these twenty years . ” It is not to be denied that the changes now in progress , and the passions , and the way in which they work , strikingly resemble those which led to the disasters the philosophic writer so feelingly bewails .

    <head>IN THE FRITH OF CLYDE , AILSA CRAG<span type="note_anchor">[ 881 ]</span></head>
    <head>DURING AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN , JULY 17</head>
    <note>The morning of the eclipse was exquisitely beautiful while we passed the Crag as described in the Sonnet . On the deck of the steam-boat were several persons of the poor and labouring class , and I could not but be struck by their cheerful talk with each other , while not one of them seemed to notice the magnificent objects with which we were surrounded ; and even the phenomenon of the eclipse attracted but little of their attention . Was it right not to regret this ? They appeared to me , however , so much alive in their own minds to their own concerns that I could not look upon it as a misfortune that they had little perception for such pleasures as cannot be cultivated without ease and leisure . Yet , if one surveys life in all its duties and relations , such ease and leisure will not be found so enviable a privilege as it may at first appear . Natural Philosophy , Painting , and Poetry , and refined taste are no doubt great acquisitions to society ; but among those who dedicate themselves to such pursuits , it is to be feared that few are as happy , and as consistent in the management of their lives , as the class of persons who at that time led me into this course of reflection . I do not mean by this to be understood to derogate from intellectual pursuits , for that would be monstrous : I say it in deep gratitude for this compensation to those whose cares are limited to the necessities of daily life . Among them , self-tormentors , so numerous in the higher classes of society , are rare .— I . F .</note>

   <p>Lieutenant-Colonel M'Dougal of Dunollie wrote to me ( October 1883 ) that “ the mosaic picture of an eagle — if it may be called so — still exists , though it is rather a rude work of art . I believe it was executed by a gardener , who was here about the time of Wordsworth 's visit . It was made of small stones , and is now a good deal overgrown with weeds , moss , etc ., as the second story of the old ruin is open to the weather . An eagle was for many years kept in a cage , made against a wall of the ruin , and this no doubt was the cause of the rude picture being made . ” — ED .</p>

    <head>“ THERE ! ” SAID A STRIPLING , POINTING WITH MEET PRIDE</head>
    <note>Mosgiel was thus pointed out to me by a young man on the top of the coach on my way from Glasgow to Kilmarnock . It is remarkable that , though Burns lived some time here , and during much the most productive period of his poetical life , he nowhere adverts to the splendid prospects stretching towards the sea and bounded by the peaks of Arran on one part , which in clear weather he must have had daily before his eyes . In one of his poetical effusions he speaks of describing “ fair Nature 's face ” as a privilege on which he sets a high value ; nevertheless , natural appearances rarely take a lead in his poetry . It is as a human being , eminently sensitive and intelligent , and not as a poet , clad in his priestly robes and carrying the ensigns of sacerdotal office , that he interests and affects us . Whether he speaks of rivers , hills and woods , it is not so much on account of the properties with which they are absolutely endowed , as relatively to local patriotic remembrances and associations , or as they ministered to personal feelings , especially those of love , whether happy or otherwise ;— yet it is not always so . Soon after we had passed Mosgiel Farm we crossed the Ayr , murmuring and winding through a narrow woody hollow . His line — “ Auld hermit Ayr strays through his woods ” — came at once to my mind with Irwin , Lugar , Ayr , and Doon ,— Ayrshire streams over which he breathes a sigh as being unnamed in song ; and surely his own attempts to make them known were as successful as his heart could desire .— I .

    <head>IN WETHERAL CHURCH , NEAR COREY , ON THE BANKS OF THE EDEN</head>
    <note>Before this monument was put up in the Church at Wetheral , I saw it in the sculptor 's studio . Nollekens , who , by-the-bye , was a strange and grotesque figure that interfered much with one 's admiration of his works , showed me at the same time the various models in clay which he had made , one after another , of the Mother and her Infant : the improvement on each was surprising ; and how so much grace , beauty , and tenderness had come out of such a head I was sadly puzzled to conceive . Upon a window-seat in his parlour lay two casts of faces , one of the Duchess of Devonshire , so noted in her day ; and the other of Mr. Pitt , taken after his death , a ghastly resemblance , as these things always are , even when taken from the living subject , and more ghastly in this instance from the peculiarity of the features . The heedless and apparently neglectful manner in which the faces of these two persons were left — the one so distinguished in London society , and the other upon whose counsels and public conduct , during a most momentous period , depended the fate of this great Empire and perhaps of all Europe — afforded a lesson to which the dullest of casual visitors could scarcely be insensible . It touched me the more because I had so often seen Mr. Pitt upon his own ground at Cambridge and upon the floor of the House of Commons .— I . F .</note>

   <p>In a letter to Sir George Beaumont , January 6 , 1821 , Wordsworth wrote , “ My road brought me suddenly and unexpectedly upon that ancient monument , called by the country people Long Meg and her Daughters . Everybody has heard of it , and so had I from very early childhood ; but had never seen it before . Next to Stonehenge it is beyond dispute the most noble relic of the kind that this or probably any other country contains . Long Meg is a single block of unhewn stone , eighteen feet high , at a small distance from a vast circle of other stones , some of them of huge size , though curtailed of their stature , by their own incessant pressure upon it . ” Compare a note in Wordsworth 's Guide to the Scenery of the Lakes , section 2 .— ED .</p>

    <note>This poem might be dedicated to my friends , Sir G. Beaumont and Mr. Rogers jointly . While we were making an excursion together in this part of the Lake District we heard that Mr. Glover , the artist , while lodging at Lyulph 's Tower , had been disturbed by a loud shriek , and upon rising he had learnt that it had come from a young woman in the house who was in the habit of walking in her sleep . In that state she had gone down stairs , and , while attempting to open the outer door , either from some difficulty or the effect of the cold stone upon her feet , had uttered the cry which alarmed him . It seemed to us all that this might serve as a hint for a poem , and the story here told was constructed and soon after put into verse by me as it now stands .— I . F .</note>

    <head>THE LABOURER 'S NOON-DAY HYMN</head>
     <l n="1">Composed 1834 .— Published 1835</l>
   </lg>
   <note>Bishop Ken 's Morning and Evening Hymns are , as they deserve to be , familiarly known . Many other hymns have also been written on the same subject ; but , not being aware of any designed for noon-day , I was induced to compose these verses . Often one has occasion to observe cottage children carrying , in their baskets , dinner to their Fathers engaged with their daily labours in the fields and woods . How gratifying would it be to me could I be assured that any portion of these stanzas had been sung by such a domestic concert under such circumstances . A friend of mine has told me that she introduced this Hymn into a village-school which she superintended , and the stanzas in succession furnished her with texts to comment upon in a way which without difficulty was made intelligible to the children , and in which they obviously took delight , and they were taught to sing it to the tune of the old 100th Psalm .— I.

Two or three of them , when the window was open , would come in , particularly when Mrs. Wordsworth was breakfasting alone , and hop about the table picking up the crumbs . My sister being then confined to her room by sickness , as , dear creature , she still is , had one that , without being caged , took up its abode with her , and at night used to perch upon a nail from which a picture had hung . It used to sing and fan her face with its wings in a manner that was very touching .— I. F .</note>
