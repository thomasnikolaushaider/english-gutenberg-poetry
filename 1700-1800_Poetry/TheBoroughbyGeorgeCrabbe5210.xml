     <l n="9">“ DESCRIBE the Borough ” — though our idle tribe</l>
     <l n="10">May love description , can we so describe ,</l>
     <l n="11">That you shall fairly streets and buildings trace ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all that gives distinction to a place ?</l>
     <l n="13">This cannot be ; yet moved by your request</l>
     <l n="14">A part I paint — let Fancy form the rest .</l>
     <l n="15">Cities and towns , the various haunts of men ,</l>
     <l n="16">Require the pencil ; they defy the pen :</l>
     <l n="17">Could he who sang so well the Grecian fleet ,</l>
     <l n="18">So well have sung of alley , lane , or street ?</l>
     <l n="19">Can measured lines these various buildings show ,</l>
     <l n="20">The Town-Hall Turning , or the Prospect Row ?</l>
     <l n="21">Can I the seats of wealth and want explore ,</l>
     <l n="22">And lengthen out my lays from door to door ?</l>
     <l n="23">Then let thy Fancy aid me — I repair</l>
     <l n="24">From this tall mansion of our last year 's Mayor ,</l>
     <l n="25">Till we the outskirts of the Borough reach ,</l>
     <l n="26">And these half-buried buildings next the beach ,</l>
     <l n="27">Where hang at open doors the net and cork ,</l>
     <l n="28">While squalid sea-dames mend the meshy work ;</l>
     <l n="29">Till comes the hour when fishing through the tide</l>
     <l n="30">The weary husband throws his freight aside ;</l>
     <l n="31">A living mass which now demands the wife ,</l>
     <l n="32">Th ’ alternate labours of their humble life .</l>
     <l n="33">Can scenes like these withdraw thee from thy wood ,</l>
     <l n="34">Thy upland forest , or thy valley 's flood ?</l>
     <l n="35">Seek then thy garden 's shrubby bound , and look ,</l>
     <l n="36">As it steals by , upon the bordering brook ;</l>
     <l n="37">That winding streamlet , limpid , lingering slow ,</l>
     <l n="38">Where the reeds whisper when the zephyrs blow ;</l>
     <l n="39">Where in the midst , upon a throne of green ,</l>
     <l n="40">Sits the large Lily as the water 's queen ;</l>
     <l n="41">And makes the current , forced awhile to stay ,</l>
     <l n="42">Murmur and bubble as it shoots away ;</l>
     <l n="43">Draw then the strongest contrast to that stream ,</l>
     <l n="44">And our broad river will before thee seem .</l>
     <l n="45">With ceaseless motion comes and goes the tide ,</l>
     <l n="46">Flowing , it fills the channel vast and wide ;</l>
     <l n="47">Then back to sea , with strong majestic sweep</l>
     <l n="48">It rolls , in ebb yet terrible and deep ;</l>
     <l n="49">Here Samphire-banks and Saltwort bound the flood ,</l>
     <l n="50">There stakes and sea-weeds withering on the mud ;</l>
     <l n="51">And higher up , a ridge of all things base ,</l>
     <l n="52">Which some strong tide has roll 'd upon the place .</l>
     <l n="53">Thy gentle river boasts its pigmy boat ,</l>
     <l n="54">Urged on by pains , half-grounded , half afloat :</l>
     <l n="55">While at her stern an angler takes his stand ,</l>
     <l n="56">And marks the fish he purposes to land ;</l>
     <l n="57">From that clear space , where , in the cheerful ray</l>
     <l n="58">Of the warm sun , the scaly people play .</l>
     <l n="59">Far other craft our prouder river shows ,</l>
     <l n="60">Hoys , pinks , and sloops : brigs , brigantines , and snows :</l>
     <l n="61">Nor angler we on our wide stream descry ,</l>
     <l n="62">But one poor dredger where his oysters lie :</l>
     <l n="63">He , cold and wet , and driving with the tide ,</l>
     <l n="64">Beats his weak arms against his tarry side ,</l>
     <l n="65">Then drains the remnant of diluted gin ,</l>
     <l n="66">To aid the warmth that languishes within ;</l>
     <l n="67">Renewing oft his poor attempts to beat</l>
     <l n="68">His tingling fingers into gathering heat .</l>
     <l n="69">He shall again be seen when evening comes ,</l>
     <l n="70">And social parties crowd their favourite rooms :</l>
     <l n="71">Where on the table pipes and papers lie ,</l>
     <l n="72">The steaming bowl or foaming tankard by ;</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Tis then , with all these comforts spread around ,</l>
     <l n="74">They hear the painful dredger 's welcome sound ;</l>
     <l n="75">And few themselves the savoury boon deny ,</l>
     <l n="76">The food that feeds , the living luxury .</l>
     <l n="77">Yon is our Quay ! those smaller hoys from town ,</l>
     <l n="78">Its various ware , for country use , bring down ;</l>
     <l n="79">Those laden waggons , in return , impart</l>
     <l n="80">The country-produce to the city mart ;</l>
     <l n="81">Hark ! to the clamour in that miry road ,</l>
     <l n="82">Bounded and narrow 'd by yon vessel 's load ;</l>
     <l n="83">The lumbering wealth she empties round the place ,</l>
     <l n="84">Package , and parcel , hogshead , chest , and case :</l>
     <l n="85">While the loud seaman and the angry hind ,</l>
     <l n="86">Mingling in business , bellow to the wind .</l>
     <l n="87">Near these a crew amphibious , in the docks ,</l>
     <l n="88">Rear , for the sea , those castles on the stocks :</l>
     <l n="89">See ! the long keel , which soon the waves must hide ;</l>
     <l n="90">See ! the strong ribs which form the roomy side ;</l>
     <l n="91">Bolts yielding slowly to the sturdiest stroke ,</l>
     <l n="92">And planks which curve and crackle in the smoke .</l>
     <l n="93">Around the whole rise cloudy wreaths , and far</l>
     <l n="94">Bear the warm pungence of o'erhYpppHeNboiling tar .</l>
     <l n="95">Dabbling on shore half-naked sea-boys crowd ,</l>
     <l n="96">Swim round a ship , or swing upon the shroud ;</l>
     <l n="97">Or in a boat purloin 'd , with paddles play ,</l>
     <l n="98">And grow familiar with the watery way :</l>
     <l n="99">Young though they be , they feel whose sons they are ,</l>
     <l n="100">They know what British seamen do and dare ;</l>
     <l n="101">Proud of that fame , they raise and they enjoy</l>
     <l n="102">The rustic wonder of the village-boy .</l>
     <l n="103">Before you bid these busy scenes adieu ,</l>
     <l n="104">Behold the wealth that lies in public view ,</l>
     <l n="105">Those far extended heaps of coal and coke ,</l>
     <l n="106">Where fresh-fill 'd lime-kilns breathe their stifling smoke .</l>
     <l n="107">This shall pass off , and you behold , instead ,</l>
     <l n="108">The night-fire gleaming on its chalky bed ;</l>
     <l n="109">When from the Lighthouse brighter beams will rise ,</l>
     <l n="110">To show the shipman where the shallow lies .</l>
     <l n="111">Thy walks are ever pleasant ; every scene</l>
     <l n="112">Is rich in beauty , lively , or serene -</l>
     <l n="113">Rich is that varied view with woods around ,</l>
     <l n="114">Seen from the seat within the shrubb'ry bound ;</l>
     <l n="115">Where shines the distant lake , and where appear</l>
     <l n="116">From ruins bolting , unmolested deer ;</l>
     <l n="117">Lively the village-green , the inn , the place ,</l>
     <l n="118">Where the good widow schools her infant-race .</l>
     <l n="119">Shops , whence are heard the hammer and the saw ,</l>
     <l n="120">And village-pleasures unreproved by law :</l>
     <l n="121">Then how serene ! when in your favourite room ,</l>
     <l n="122">Gales from your jasmines soothe the evening gloom ;</l>
     <l n="123">When from your upland paddock you look down ,</l>
     <l n="124">And just perceive the smoke which hides the town ;</l>
     <l n="125">When weary peasants at the close of day</l>
     <l n="126">Walk to their cots , and part upon the way ;</l>
     <l n="127">When cattle slowly cross the shallow brook ,</l>
     <l n="128">And shepherds pen their folds , and rest upon their crook .</l>
     <l n="129">We prune our hedges , prime our slender trees ,</l>
     <l n="130">And nothing looks untutor 'd and at ease ,</l>
     <l n="131">On the wide heath , or in the flowery vale ,</l>
     <l n="132">We scent the vapours of the sea-born gale ;</l>
     <l n="133">Broad-beaten paths lead on from stile to stile ,</l>
     <l n="134">And sewers from streets the road-side banks defile ;</l>
     <l n="135">Our guarded fields a sense of danger show ,</l>
     <l n="136">Where garden-crops with corn and clover grow ;</l>
     <l n="137">Fences are form 'd of wreck , and placed around ,</l>
     <l n="138">( With tenters tipp 'd ) a strong repulsive bound ;</l>
     <l n="139">Wide and deep ditches by the gardens run ,</l>
     <l n="140">And there in ambush lie the trap and gun ;</l>
     <l n="141">Or yon broad board , which guards each tempting prize ,</l>
     <l n="142">“ Like a tall bully , lifts its head and lies . ”</l>
     <l n="143">There stands a cottage with an open door ,</l>
     <l n="144">Its garden undefended blooms before :</l>
     <l n="145">Her wheel is still , and overturn 'd her stool ,</l>
     <l n="146">While the lone Widow seeks the neighb'ring pool :</l>
     <l n="147">This gives us hope , all views of town to shun -</l>
     <l n="148">No ! here are tokens of the Sailor-son ;</l>
     <l n="149">That old blue jacket , and that shirt of check ,</l>
     <l n="150">And silken kerchief for the seaman 's neck ;</l>
     <l n="151">Sea-spoils and shells from many a distant shore ,</l>
     <l n="152">And furry robe from frozen Labrador .</l>
     <l n="153">Our busy streets and sylvan-walks between ,</l>
     <l n="154">Fen , marshes , bog , and heath all intervene ;</l>
     <l n="155">Here pits of crag , with spongy , plashy base ,</l>
     <l n="156">To some enrich th ’ uncultivated space :</l>
     <l n="157">For there are blossoms rare , and curious rush ,</l>
     <l n="158">The gale 's rich balm , and sun-dew 's crimson blush ,</l>
     <l n="159">Whose velvet leaf with radiant beauty dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="160">Forms a gay pillow for the plover 's breast .</l>
     <l n="161">Not distant far , a house commodious made ,</l>
     <l n="162">( Lonely yet public stands ) for Sunday-trade ;</l>
     <l n="163">Thither , for this day free , gay parties go ,</l>
     <l n="164">Their tea-house walk , their tippling rendezvous ;</l>
     <l n="165">There humble couples sit in corner-bowers ,</l>
     <l n="166">Or gaily ramble for th ’ allotted hours ;</l>
     <l n="167">Sailors and lasses from the town attend ,</l>
     <l n="168">The servant-lover , the apprentice-friend ;</l>
     <l n="169">With all the idle social tribes who seek</l>
     <l n="170">And find their humble pleasures once a week .</l>
     <l n="171">Turn to the watery world !— but who to thee</l>
     <l n="172">( A wonder yet unview 'd ) shall paint — the Sea ?</l>
     <l n="173">Various and vast , sublime in all its forms ,</l>
     <l n="174">When lull 'd by zephyrs , or when roused by storms ,</l>
     <l n="175">Its colours changing , when from clouds and sun</l>
     <l n="176">Shades after shades upon the surface run ;</l>
     <l n="177">Embrown 'd and horrid now , and now serene ,</l>
     <l n="178">In limpid blue , and evanescent green ;</l>
     <l n="179">And oft the foggy banks on ocean lie ,</l>
     <l n="180">Lift the fair sail , and cheat th ’ experienced eye .</l>
     <l n="181">Be it the summer — noon : a sandy space</l>
     <l n="182">The ebbing tide has left upon its place ;</l>
     <l n="183">Then just the hot and stony beach above ,</l>
     <l n="184">Light twinkling streams in bright confusion move ;</l>
     <l n="185">( For heated thus , the warmer air ascends ,</l>
     <l n="186">And with the cooler in its fall contends )</l>
     <l n="187">Then the broad bosom of the ocean keeps</l>
     <l n="188">An equal motion ; swelling as it sleeps ,</l>
     <l n="189">Then slowly sinking ; curling to the strand ,</l>
     <l n="190">Faint , lazy waves o'ercreep the rigid sand ,</l>
     <l n="191">Or tap the tarry boat with gentle blow ,</l>
     <l n="192">And back return in silence , smooth and slow .</l>
     <l n="193">Ships in the calm seem anchor 'd ; for they glide</l>
     <l n="194">On the still sea , urged solely by the tide :</l>
     <l n="195">Art thou not present , this calm scene before ,</l>
     <l n="196">Where all beside is pebbly length of shore ,</l>
     <l n="197">And far as eye can reach , it can discern no more ?</l>
     <l n="198">Yet sometimes comes a ruffing cloud to make</l>
     <l n="199">The quiet surface of the ocean shake ;</l>
     <l n="200">As an awaken 'd giant with a frown</l>
     <l n="201">Might show his wrath , and then to sleep sink down .</l>
     <l n="202">View now the Winter-storm ! above , one cloud ,</l>
     <l n="203">Black and unbroken , all the skies o'ershroud :</l>
     <l n="204">Th ’ unwieldy porpoise through the day before</l>
     <l n="205">Had roll 'd in view of boding men on shore ;</l>
     <l n="206">And sometimes hid and sometimes show 'd his form ,</l>
     <l n="207">Dark as the cloud , and furious as the storm .</l>
     <l n="208">All where the eye delights , yet dreads to roam ,</l>
     <l n="209">The breaking billows cast the flying foam</l>
     <l n="210">Upon the billows rising — all the deep</l>
     <l n="211">Is restless change ; the waves so swell 'd and steep ,</l>
     <l n="212">Breaking and sinking , and the sunken swells ,</l>
     <l n="213">Nor one , one moment , in its station dwells :</l>
     <l n="214">But nearer land you may the billows trace ,</l>
     <l n="215">As if contending in their watery chase ;</l>
     <l n="216">May watch the mightiest till the shoal they reach ,</l>
     <l n="217">Then break and hurry to their utmost stretch ;</l>
     <l n="218">Curl 'd as they come , they strike with furious force ,</l>
     <l n="219">And then re-flowing , take their grating course ,</l>
     <l n="220">Raking the rounded flints , which ages past</l>
     <l n="221">Roll 'd by their rage , and shall to ages last .</l>
     <l n="222">Far off the Petrel in the troubled way</l>
     <l n="223">Swims with her brood , or flutters in the spray ;</l>
     <l n="224">She rises often , often drops again ,</l>
     <l n="225">And sports at ease on the tempestuous main .</l>
     <l n="226">High o'er the restless deep , above the reach</l>
     <l n="227">Of gunner 's hope , vast flights of Wild-ducks stretch ;</l>
     <l n="228">Far as the eye can glance on either side ,</l>
     <l n="229">In a broad space and level line they glide ;</l>
     <l n="230">All in their wedge-like figures from the north ,</l>
     <l n="231">Day after day , flight after flight , go forth .</l>
     <l n="232">In-shore their passage tribes of Sea-gulls urge ,</l>
     <l n="233">And drop for prey within the sweeping surge ;</l>
     <l n="234">Oft in the rough opposing blast they fly</l>
     <l n="235">Far back , then turn , and all their force apply ,</l>
     <l n="236">While to the storm they give their weak complaining cry ;</l>
     <l n="237">Or clap the sleek white pinion to the breast ,</l>
     <l n="238">And in the restless ocean dip for rest .</l>
     <l n="239">Darkness begins to reign ; the louder wind</l>
     <l n="240">Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind ;</l>
     <l n="241">But frights not him whom evening and the spray</l>
     <l n="242">In part conceal — yon Prowler on his way :</l>
     <l n="243">Lo ! he has something seen ; he runs apace ,</l>
     <l n="244">As if he fear 'd companion in the chase ;</l>
     <l n="245">He sees his prize , and now he turns again ,</l>
     <l n="246">Slowly and sorrowing — “ Was your search in vain ? ”</l>
     <l n="247">Gruffly he answers , “ ‘ Tis a sorry sight !</l>
     <l n="248">A seaman 's body : there 'll be more to-night ! ”</l>
     <l n="249">Hark ! to those sounds ! they 're from distress at sea ;</l>
     <l n="250">How quick they come ! What terrors may there be !</l>
     <l n="251">Yes , ‘ tis a driven vessel : I discern</l>
     <l n="252">Lights , signs of terror , gleaming from the stern ;</l>
     <l n="253">Others behold them too , and from the town</l>
     <l n="254">In various parties seamen hurry down ;</l>
     <l n="255">Their wives pursue , and damsels urged by dread ,</l>
     <l n="256">Lest men so dear be into danger led ;</l>
     <l n="257">Their head the gown has hooded , and their call</l>
     <l n="258">In this sad night is piercing like the squall ;</l>
     <l n="259">They feel their kinds of power , and when they meet ,</l>
     <l n="260">Chide , fondle , weep , dare , threaten , or entreat .</l>
     <l n="261">See one poor girl , all terror and alarm ,</l>
     <l n="262">Has fondly seized upon her lover 's arm ;</l>
     <l n="263">“ Thou shalt not venture ; ” and he answers “ No !</l>
     <l n="264">I will not : ” — still she cries , “ Thou shalt not go . ”</l>
     <l n="265">No need of this ; not here the stoutest boat</l>
     <l n="266">Can through such breakers , o'er such billows float ,</l>
     <l n="267">Yet may they view these lights upon the beach ,</l>
     <l n="268">Which yield them hope whom help can never reach .</l>
     <l n="269">From parted clouds the moon her radiance throws</l>
     <l n="270">On the wild waves , and all the danger shows ;</l>
     <l n="271">But shows them beaming in her shining vest ,</l>
     <l n="272">Terrific splendour ! gloom in glory dress 'd !</l>
     <l n="273">This for a moment , and then clouds again</l>
     <l n="274">Hide every beam , and fear and darkness reign .</l>
     <l n="275">But hear we not those sounds ? Do lights appear ?</l>
     <l n="276">I see them not ! the storm alone I hear :</l>
     <l n="277">And lo ! the sailors homeward take their way ;</l>
     <l n="278">Man must endure — let us submit and pray .</l>
     <l n="279">Such are our Winter-views : but night comes on -</l>
     <l n="280">Now business sleeps , and daily cares are gone ;</l>
     <l n="281">Now parties form , and some their friends assist</l>
     <l n="282">To waste the idle hours at sober whist ;</l>
     <l n="283">The tavern 's pleasure or the concert 's charm</l>
     <l n="284">Unnumber 'd moments of their sting disarm :</l>
     <l n="285">Play-bills and open doors a crowd invite ,</l>
     <l n="286">To pass off one dread portion of the night ;</l>
     <l n="287">And show and song and luxury combined ,</l>
     <l n="288">Lift off from man this burthen of mankind .</l>
     <l n="289">Others advent'rous walk abroad and meet</l>
     <l n="290">Returning parties pacing through the street ,</l>
     <l n="291">When various voices , in the dying day ,</l>
     <l n="292">Hum in our walks , and greet us in our way ;</l>
     <l n="293">When tavern-lights flit on from room to room ,</l>
     <l n="294">And guide the tippling sailor staggering home :</l>
     <l n="295">There as we pass , the jingling bells betray</l>
     <l n="296">How business rises with the closing day :</l>
     <l n="297">Now walking silent , by the river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="298">The ear perceives the rippling of the tide ;</l>
     <l n="299">Or measured cadence of the lads who tow</l>
     <l n="300">Some entered hoy , to fix her in her row ;</l>
     <l n="301">Or hollow sound , which from the parish-bell</l>
     <l n="302">To some departed spirit bids farewell !</l>
     <l n="303">Thus shall you something of our BOROUGH know ,</l>
     <l n="304">Far as a verse , with Fancy 's aid , can show .</l>
     <l n="305">Of Sea or River , of a Quay or Street ,</l>
     <l n="306">The best description must be incomplete ;</l>
     <l n="307">But when a happier theme succeeds , and when</l>
     <l n="308">Men are our subjects and the deeds of men ,</l>
     <l n="309">Then may we find the Muse in happier style ,</l>
     <l n="310">And we may sometimes sigh and sometimes smile .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">“ WHAT is a Church ? ” — Let Truth and Reason speak ,</l>
     <l n="10">They would reply , “ The faithful , pure , and meek ;</l>
     <l n="11">From Christian folds , the one selected race ,</l>
     <l n="12">Of all professions , and in every place . ”</l>
     <l n="13">“ What is a Church ? ” — “ A flock , ” our Vicar cries ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Whom bishops govern and whom priests advise ;</l>
     <l n="15">Wherein are various states and due degrees ,</l>
     <l n="16">The Bench for honour , and the Stall for ease ;</l>
     <l n="17">That ease be mine , which , after all his cares ,</l>
     <l n="18">The pious , peaceful prebendary shares . ”</l>
     <l n="19">“ What is a Church ? ” — Our honest Sexton tells ,</l>
     <l n="20">“ ‘ Tis a tall building , with a tower and bells ;</l>
     <l n="21">Where priest and clerk with joint exertion strive</l>
     <l n="22">To keep the ardour af their flock alive ;</l>
     <l n="23">That , by its periods eloquent and grave ;</l>
     <l n="24">This , by responses , and a well-set stave :</l>
     <l n="25">These for the living ; but when life be fled ,</l>
     <l n="26">I toll myself the requiem for the dead . ”</l>
     <l n="27">‘ Tis to this Church I call thee , and that place</l>
     <l n="28">Where slept our fathers when they 'd run their race :</l>
     <l n="29">We too shall rest , and then our children keep</l>
     <l n="30">Their road in life , and then , forgotten , sleep ;</l>
     <l n="31">Meanwhile the building slowly falls away ,</l>
     <l n="32">And , like the builders , will in time decay .</l>
     <l n="33">The old Foundation — but it is not clear</l>
     <l n="34">When it was laid — you care not for the year ;</l>
     <l n="35">On this , as parts decayed by time and storms ,</l>
     <l n="36">Arose these various disproportion 'd forms ;</l>
     <l n="37">Yet Gothic all — the learn 'd who visit us</l>
     <l n="38">( And our small wonders ) have decided thus : -</l>
     <l n="39">“ Yon noble Gothic arch , ” “ That Gothic door ; ”</l>
     <l n="40">So have they said ; of proof you 'll need no more .</l>
     <l n="41">Here large plain columns rise in solemn style ,</l>
     <l n="42">You 'd love the gloom they make in either aisle ;</l>
     <l n="43">When the sun 's rays , enfeebled as they pass</l>
     <l n="44">( And shorn of splendour ) through the storied glass ,</l>
     <l n="45">Faintly display the figures on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="46">Which pleased distinctly in their place before .</l>
     <l n="47">But ere you enter , yon bold tower survey ,</l>
     <l n="48">Tall and entire , and venerably gray ,</l>
     <l n="49">For time has soften 'd what was harsh when new ,</l>
     <l n="50">And now the stains are all of sober hue ;</l>
     <l n="51">The living stains which Nature 's hand alone ,</l>
     <l n="52">Profuse of life , pours forth upon the stone :</l>
     <l n="53">For ever growing ; where the common eye</l>
     <l n="54">Can but the bare and rocky bed descry ;</l>
     <l n="55">There Science loves to trace her tribes minute ,</l>
     <l n="56">The juiceless foliage , and the tasteless fruit ;</l>
     <l n="57">There she perceives them round the surface creep ,</l>
     <l n="58">And while they meet their due distinction keep ;</l>
     <l n="59">Mix 'd but not blended ; each its name retains ,</l>
     <l n="60">And these are Nature 's ever-during stains .</l>
     <l n="61">And wouldst thou , Artist ! with thy tints and brush ,</l>
     <l n="62">Form shades like these ? Pretender , where thy blush ?</l>
     <l n="63">In three short hours shall thy presuming hand</l>
     <l n="64">Th ’ effect of three slow centuries command ?</l>
     <l n="65">Thou may'st thy various greens and grays contrive ;</l>
     <l n="66">They are not Lichens , nor like ought alive ; -</l>
     <l n="67">But yet proceed , and when thy tints are lost ,</l>
     <l n="68">Fled in the shower , or crumbled by the frost ;</l>
     <l n="69">When all thy work is done away as clean</l>
     <l n="70">As if thou never spread'st thy gray and green ;</l>
     <l n="71">Then may'st thou see how Nature 's work is done ,</l>
     <l n="72">How slowly true she lays her colours on ;</l>
     <l n="73">When her least speck upon the hardest flint</l>
     <l n="74">Has mark and form , and is a living tint ;</l>
     <l n="75">And so embodied with the rock , that few</l>
     <l n="76">Can the small germ upon the substance view .</l>
     <l n="77">Seeds , to our eyes invisible , will find</l>
     <l n="78">On the rude rock the bed that fits their kind ;</l>
     <l n="79">There , in the rugged soil , they safely dwell ,</l>
     <l n="80">Till showers and snows the subtle atoms swell ,</l>
     <l n="81">And spread th ’ enduring foliage ;— then we trace</l>
     <l n="82">The freckled flower upon the flinty base ;</l>
     <l n="83">These all increase , till in unnoticed years</l>
     <l n="84">The stony tower as gray with age appears ;</l>
     <l n="85">With coats of vegetation , thinly spread ,</l>
     <l n="86">Coat above coat , the living on the dead ;</l>
     <l n="87">These then dissolve to dust , and make a way</l>
     <l n="88">For bolder foliage , nursed by their decay :</l>
     <l n="89">The long-enduring Ferns in time will all</l>
     <l n="90">Die and depose their dust upon the wall ;</l>
     <l n="91">Where the wing 'd seed may rest , till many a flower</l>
     <l n="92">Show Flora 's triumph o'er the falling tower .</l>
     <l n="93">But ours yet stands , and has its Bells renown 'd</l>
     <l n="94">For size magnificent and solemn sound ;</l>
     <l n="95">Each has its motto : some contrived to tell ,</l>
     <l n="96">In monkish rhyme , the uses of a bell ;</l>
     <l n="97">Such wond'rous good , as few conceive could spring</l>
     <l n="98">From ten loud coppers when their clampers swing .</l>
     <l n="99">Enter 'd the Church — we to a tomb proceed ,</l>
     <l n="100">Whose names and titles few attempt to read ;</l>
     <l n="101">Old English letters , and those half pick 'd out ,</l>
     <l n="102">Leave us , unskilful readers , much in doubt ;</l>
     <l n="103">Our sons shall see its more degraded state ;</l>
     <l n="104">The tomb of grandeur hastens to its fate ;</l>
     <l n="105">That marble arch , our sexton 's favourite show ,</l>
     <l n="106">With all those ruff 'd and painted pairs below ;</l>
     <l n="107">The noble Lady and the Lord who rest</l>
     <l n="108">Supine , as courtly dame and warrior drest ;</l>
     <l n="109">All are departed from their state sublime ,</l>
     <l n="110">Mangled and wounded in their war with Time ,</l>
     <l n="111">Colleagued with mischief : here a leg is fled ,</l>
     <l n="112">And lo ! the Baron with but half a head :</l>
     <l n="113">Midway is cleft the arch ; the very base</l>
     <l n="114">Is batter 'd round and shifted from its place .</l>
     <l n="115">Wonder not , Mortal , at thy quick decay -</l>
     <l n="116">See ! men of marble piecemeal melt away ;</l>
     <l n="117">When whose the image we no longer read ,</l>
     <l n="118">But monuments themselves memorials need .</l>
     <l n="119">With few such stately proofs of grief or pride ,</l>
     <l n="120">By wealth erected , is our Church supplied ;</l>
     <l n="121">But we have mural tablets , every size ,</l>
     <l n="122">That woe could wish , or vanity devise .</l>
     <l n="123">Death levels man — the wicked and the just ,</l>
     <l n="124">The wise , the weak , lie blended in the dust ;</l>
     <l n="125">And by the honours dealt to every name ,</l>
     <l n="126">The King of Terrors seems to level fame .</l>
     <l n="127">- See ! here lamented wives , and every wife</l>
     <l n="128">The pride and comfort of her husband 's life ;</l>
     <l n="129">Here , to her spouse , with every virtue graced ,</l>
     <l n="130">His mournful widow has a trophy placed ;</l>
     <l n="131">And here ‘ tis doubtful if the duteous son ,</l>
     <l n="132">Or the good father , be in praise outdone .</l>
     <l n="133">This may be Nature : when our friends we lose ,</l>
     <l n="134">Our alter 'd feelings alter too our views ;</l>
     <l n="135">What in their tempers teased us or distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="136">Is , with our anger and the dead , at rest ;</l>
     <l n="137">And much we grieve , no longer trial made ,</l>
     <l n="138">For that impatience which we then display 'd ;</l>
     <l n="139">Now to their love and worth of every kind</l>
     <l n="140">A soft compunction turns th ’ afflicted mind ;</l>
     <l n="141">Virtues neglected then , adored become ,</l>
     <l n="142">And graces slighted , blossom on the tomb .</l>
     <l n="143">‘ Tis well ; but let not love nor grief believe</l>
     <l n="144">That we assent ( who neither loved nor grieve )</l>
     <l n="145">To all that praise which on the tomb is read ,</l>
     <l n="146">To all that passion dictates for the dead ;</l>
     <l n="147">But more indignant , we the tomb deride ,</l>
     <l n="148">Whose bold inscription flattery sells to pride .</l>
     <l n="149">Read of this Burgess — on the stone appear</l>
     <l n="150">How worthy he ! how virtuous ! and how dear !</l>
     <l n="151">What wailing was there when his spirit fled ,</l>
     <l n="152">How mourned his lady for her lord when dead ,</l>
     <l n="153">And tears abundant through the town were shed ;</l>
     <l n="154">See ! he was liberal , kind , religious , wise ,</l>
     <l n="155">And free from all disgrace and all disguise ;</l>
     <l n="156">His sterling worth , which words cannot express ,</l>
     <l n="157">Lives with his friends , their pride and their distress .</l>
     <l n="158">All this of Jacob Holmes ? for his the name :</l>
     <l n="159">He thus kind , liberal , just , religious ?— Shame !</l>
     <l n="160">What is the truth ? Old Jacob married thrice ;</l>
     <l n="161">He dealt in coals , and av'rice was his vice ;</l>
     <l n="162">He ruled the Borough when his year came on ,</l>
     <l n="163">And some forget , and some are glad he 's gone ;</l>
     <l n="164">For never yet with shilling could he part ,</l>
     <l n="165">But when it left his hand it struck his heart .</l>
     <l n="166">Yet , here will Love its last attentions pay ,</l>
     <l n="167">And place memorials on these beds of clay ;</l>
     <l n="168">Large level stones lie flat upon the grave ,</l>
     <l n="169">And half a century 's sun and tempest brave ;</l>
     <l n="170">But many an honest tear and heartfelt sigh</l>
     <l n="171">Have follow 'd those who now unnoticed lie ;</l>
     <l n="172">Of these what numbers rest on every side !</l>
     <l n="173">Without one token left by grief or pride ;</l>
     <l n="174">Their graves soon levell 'd to the earth , and then</l>
     <l n="175">Will other hillocks rise o'er other men ;</l>
     <l n="176">Daily the dead on the decay 'd are thrust ,</l>
     <l n="177">And generations follow , “ dust to dust . ”</l>
     <l n="178">Yes ! there are real Mourners — I have seen</l>
     <l n="179">A fair , sad Girl , mild , suffering , and serene ;</l>
     <l n="180">Attention ( through the day ) her duties claim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="181">And to be useful as resign 'd she aim 'd :</l>
     <l n="182">Neatly she dress 'd , nor vainly seem 'd t'expect</l>
     <l n="183">Pity for grief , or pardon for neglect ;</l>
     <l n="184">But when her wearied parents sunk to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="185">She sought her place to meditate and weep :</l>
     <l n="186">Then to her mind was all the past display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="187">That faithful Memory brings to Sorrow 's aid ;</l>
     <l n="188">For then she thought on one regretted Youth ,</l>
     <l n="189">Her tender trust , and his unquestioned truth ;</l>
     <l n="190">In ev'ry place she wander 'd , where they 'd been ,</l>
     <l n="191">And sadly sacred held the parting scene ;</l>
     <l n="192">Where last for sea he took his leave — that place</l>
     <l n="193">With double interest would she nightly trace ;</l>
     <l n="194">For long the courtship was , and he would say ,</l>
     <l n="195">Each time he sail 'd ,— “ This once , and then the day :</l>
     <l n="196">Yet prudence tarried , but when last he went ,</l>
     <l n="197">He drew from pitying love a full consent .</l>
     <l n="198">Happy he sail 'd , and great the care she took</l>
     <l n="199">That he should softly sleep and smartly look ;</l>
     <l n="200">White was his better linen , and his check</l>
     <l n="201">Was made more trim than any on the deck ;</l>
     <l n="202">And every comfort men at sea can know</l>
     <l n="203">Was hers to buy , to make , and to bestow ?</l>
     <l n="204">For he to Greenland sail 'd , and much she told</l>
     <l n="205">How he should guard against the climate 's cold ;</l>
     <l n="206">Yet saw not danger ; dangers he 'd withstood ,</l>
     <l n="207">Nor could she trace the fever in his blood :</l>
     <l n="208">His messmates smiled at flushings in his cheek ,</l>
     <l n="209">And he too smiled , but seldom would he speak ;</l>
     <l n="210">For now he found the danger , felt the pain ,</l>
     <l n="211">With grievous symptoms he could not explain ;</l>
     <l n="212">Hope was awaken 'd , as for home he sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="213">But quickly sank , and never more prevail 'd .</l>
     <l n="214">He call 'd his friend , and prefaced with a sigh</l>
     <l n="215">A lover 's message — “ Thomas , I must die :</l>
     <l n="216">Would I could see my Sally , and could rest</l>
     <l n="217">My throbbing temples on her faithful breast ,</l>
     <l n="218">And gazing go !— if not , this trifle take ,</l>
     <l n="219">And say , till death I wore it for her sake :</l>
     <l n="220">Yes ! I must die — blow on , sweet breeze , blow on !</l>
     <l n="221">Give me one look before my life be gone ,</l>
     <l n="222">Oh ! give me that , and let me not despair ,</l>
     <l n="223">One last fond look — and now repeat the prayer . ”</l>
     <l n="224">He had his wish , had more : I will not paint</l>
     <l n="225">The Lovers ’ meeting : she beheld him faint , -</l>
     <l n="226">With tender fears , she took a nearer view ,</l>
     <l n="227">Her terrors doubling as her hopes withdrew ;</l>
     <l n="228">He tried to smile , and , half succeeding , said ,</l>
     <l n="229">“ Yes ! I must die ; ” and hope for ever fled .</l>
     <l n="230">Still long she nursed him : tender thoughts meantime</l>
     <l n="231">Were interchanged , and hopes and views sublime :</l>
     <l n="232">To her he came to die , and every day</l>
     <l n="233">She took some portion of the dread away ;</l>
     <l n="234">With him she pray 'd , to him his Bible read ,</l>
     <l n="235">Soothed the faint heart , and held the aching head :</l>
     <l n="236">She came with smiles the hour of pain to cheer :</l>
     <l n="237">Apart she sigh 'd ; alone , she shed the tear :</l>
     <l n="238">Then as if breaking from a cloud , she gave</l>
     <l n="239">Fresh light , and gilt the prospect of the grave .</l>
     <l n="240">One day he lighter seemed , and they forgot</l>
     <l n="241">The care , the dread , the anguish of their lot ;</l>
     <l n="242">They spoke with cheerfulness , and seem 'd to think ,</l>
     <l n="243">Yet said not so — “ Perhaps he will not sink : ”</l>
     <l n="244">A sudden brightness in his look appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="245">A sudden vigour in his voice was heard , -</l>
     <l n="246">She had been reading in the Book of Prayer ,</l>
     <l n="247">And led him forth , and placed him in his chair ;</l>
     <l n="248">Lively he seem 'd , and spoke of all he knew ,</l>
     <l n="249">The friendly many , and the favourite few ;</l>
     <l n="250">Nor one that day did he to mind recall</l>
     <l n="251">But she has treasured , and she loves them all :</l>
     <l n="252">When in her way she meets them , they appear</l>
     <l n="253">Peculiar people — death has made them dear .</l>
     <l n="254">He named his Friend , but then his hand she press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="255">And fondly whisper 'd , “ Thou must go to rest ; ”</l>
     <l n="256">“ I go , ” he said : but as he spoke , she found</l>
     <l n="257">His hand more cold , and fluttering was the sound !</l>
     <l n="258">Then gazed affrighten 'd ; but she caught a last ,</l>
     <l n="259">A dying look of love ,— and all was past !</l>
     <l n="260">She placed a decent stone his grave above ,</l>
     <l n="261">Neatly engraved — an offering of her love ;</l>
     <l n="262">For that she wrought , for that forsook her bed ,</l>
     <l n="263">Awake alike to duty and the dead ;</l>
     <l n="264">She would have grieved , had friends presum 'd to spare</l>
     <l n="265">The least assistance — ‘ twas her proper care .</l>
     <l n="266">Here will she come , and on the grave will sit ,</l>
     <l n="267">Folding her arms , in long abstracted fit ;</l>
     <l n="268">But if observer pass , will take her round ,</l>
     <l n="269">And careless seem , for she would not be found ;</l>
     <l n="270">Then go again , and thus her hour employ ,</l>
     <l n="271">While visions please her , and while woes destroy .</l>
     <l n="272">Forbear , sweet Maid ! nor be by Fancy led ,</l>
     <l n="273">To hold mysterious converse with the dead ;</l>
     <l n="274">For sure at length thy thoughts , thy spirit 's pain ,</l>
     <l n="275">In this sad conflict will disturb thy brain ;</l>
     <l n="276">All have their tasks and trials ; thine are hard ,</l>
     <l n="277">But short the time , and glorious the reward ;</l>
     <l n="278">Thy patient spirit to thy duties give ,</l>
     <l n="279">Regard the dead , but to the living live .</l>

    <head>THE VICAR .</head>
     <l n="1">WHERE ends our chancel in a vaulted space ,</l>
     <l n="2">Sleep the departed Vicars of the place ;</l>
     <l n="3">Of most , all mention , memory , thought are past -</l>
     <l n="4">But take a slight memorial of the last .</l>
     <l n="5">To what famed college we our Yicar owe ,</l>
     <l n="6">To what fair county , let historians show :</l>
     <l n="7">Few now remember when the mild young man ,</l>
     <l n="8">Ruddy and fair , his Sunday-task began ;</l>
     <l n="9">Few live to speak of that soft soothing look</l>
     <l n="10">He cast around , as he prepared his book ;</l>
     <l n="11">It was a kind of supplicating smile ,</l>
     <l n="12">But nothing hopeless of applause the while ;</l>
     <l n="13">And when he finished , his corrected pride</l>
     <l n="14">Felt the desert , and yet the praise denied .</l>
     <l n="15">Thus he his race began , and to the end</l>
     <l n="16">His constant care was , no man to offend ;</l>
     <l n="17">No haughty virtues stirr 'd his peaceful mind ;</l>
     <l n="18">Nor urged the Priest to leave the Flock behind ;</l>
     <l n="19">He was his Master 's Soldier , but not one</l>
     <l n="20">To lead an army of his Martyrs on :</l>
     <l n="21">Fear was his ruling passion ; yet was Love ,</l>
     <l n="22">Of timid kind , once known his heart to move ;</l>
     <l n="23">It led his patient spirit where it paid</l>
     <l n="24">Its languid offerings to a listening Maid :</l>
     <l n="25">She , with her widow 'd Mother , heard him speak ,</l>
     <l n="26">And sought awhile to find what he would seek :</l>
     <l n="27">Smiling he came , he smiled when he withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="28">And paid the same attention to the two ;</l>
     <l n="29">Meeting and parting without joy or pain ,</l>
     <l n="30">He seem 'd to come that he might go again .</l>
     <l n="31">The wondering girl , no prude , but something nice ,</l>
     <l n="32">At length was chill 'd by his unmelting ice ;</l>
     <l n="33">She found her tortoise held such sluggish pace ,</l>
     <l n="34">That she must turn and meet him in the chase :</l>
     <l n="35">This not approving , she withdrew , till one</l>
     <l n="36">Came who appear 'd with livelier hope to run ;</l>
     <l n="37">Who sought a readier way the heart to move ,</l>
     <l n="38">Than by faint dalliance of unfixing love .</l>
     <l n="39">Accuse me not that I approving paint</l>
     <l n="40">Impatient Hope or Love without restraint ;</l>
     <l n="41">Or think the Passions , a tumultuous throng ,</l>
     <l n="42">Strong as they are , ungovernably strong :</l>
     <l n="43">But is the laurel to the soldier due ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who , cautious , comes not into danger 's view ?</l>
     <l n="45">What worth has Virtue by Desire untried ,</l>
     <l n="46">When Nature 's self enlists on Duty 's side ?</l>
     <l n="47">The married dame in vain assail 'd the truth</l>
     <l n="48">And guarded bosom of the Hebrew youth ;</l>
     <l n="49">But with the daughter of the Priest of On</l>
     <l n="50">The love was lawful , and the guard was gone ;</l>
     <l n="51">But Joseph 's fame had lessened in our view ,</l>
     <l n="52">Had he , refusing , fled the maiden too .</l>
     <l n="53">Yet our good priest to Joseph 's praise aspired ,</l>
     <l n="54">As once rejecting what his heart desired ;</l>
     <l n="55">“ I am escaped , ” he said , when none pursued ;</l>
     <l n="56">When none attack 'd him , “ I am unsubdued ; ”</l>
     <l n="57">“ Oh pleasing pangs of love ! ” he sang again ,</l>
     <l n="58">Cold to the joy , and stranger to the pain .</l>
     <l n="59">E'en in his age would he address the young ,</l>
     <l n="60">“ I too have felt these fires , and they are strong ; ”</l>
     <l n="61">But from the time he left his favourite maid ,</l>
     <l n="62">To ancient females his devoirs were paid :</l>
     <l n="63">And still they miss him after Morning-prayer ;</l>
     <l n="64">Nor yet successor fills the Vicar 's chair ,</l>
     <l n="65">Where kindred spirits in his praise agree ,</l>
     <l n="66">A happy few , as mild and cool as he ;</l>
     <l n="67">The easy followers in the female train ,</l>
     <l n="68">Led without love , and captives without chain .</l>
     <l n="69">Ye Lilies male ! think ( as your tea you sip ,</l>
     <l n="70">While the town small-talk flows from lip to lip ;</l>
     <l n="71">Intrigues half-gather 'd , conversation-scraps ,</l>
     <l n="72">Kitchen cabals , and nursery-mishaps ) ,</l>
     <l n="73">If the vast world may not some scene produce ,</l>
     <l n="74">Some state where your small talents might have use ;</l>
     <l n="75">Within seraglios you might harmless move ,</l>
     <l n="76">‘ Mid ranks of beauty , and in haunts of love ;</l>
     <l n="77">There from too daring man the treasures guard ,</l>
     <l n="78">An easy duty , and its own reward ;</l>
     <l n="79">Nature 's soft substitutes , you there might save</l>
     <l n="80">From crime the tyrant , and from wrong the slave .</l>
     <l n="81">But let applause be dealt in all we may ,</l>
     <l n="82">Our Priest was cheerful , and in season gay ;</l>
     <l n="83">His frequent visits seldom fail 'd to please ;</l>
     <l n="84">Easy himself , he sought his neighbour 's ease :</l>
     <l n="85">To a small garden with delight he came ,</l>
     <l n="86">And gave successive flowers a summer 's fame ;</l>
     <l n="87">These he presented , with a grace his own ,</l>
     <l n="88">To his fair friends , and made their beauties known ,</l>
     <l n="89">Not without moral compliment ; how they</l>
     <l n="90">“ Like flowers were sweet , and must like flowers decay . ’</l>
     <l n="91">Simple he was , and loved the simple truth ,</l>
     <l n="92">Yet had some useful cunning from his youth ;</l>
     <l n="93">A cunning never to dishonour lent ,</l>
     <l n="94">And rather for defence than conquest meant ;</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Twas fear of power , with some desire to rise ,</l>
     <l n="96">But not enough to make him enemies ;</l>
     <l n="97">He ever aim 'd to please ; and to offend</l>
     <l n="98">Was ever cautious ; for he sought a friend ;</l>
     <l n="99">Yet for the friendship never much would pay ,</l>
     <l n="100">Content to bow , be silent , and obey ,</l>
     <l n="101">And by a soothing suff'rance find his way .</l>
     <l n="102">Fiddling and fishing were his arts : at times</l>
     <l n="103">He alter 'd sermons , and he aim 'd at rhymes ;</l>
     <l n="104">And his fair friends , not yet intent on cards ,</l>
     <l n="105">Oft he amused with riddles and charades .</l>
     <l n="106">Mild were his doctrines , and not one discourse</l>
     <l n="107">But gain 'd in softness what it lost in force :</l>
     <l n="108">Kind his opinions ; he would not receive</l>
     <l n="109">An ill report , nor evil act believe ;</l>
     <l n="110">“ If true , ‘ twas wrong ; but blemish great or small</l>
     <l n="111">Have all mankind ; yea , sinners are we all . ”</l>
     <l n="112">If ever fretful thought disturb 'd his breast ,</l>
     <l n="113">If aught of gloom that cheerful mind oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="114">It sprang from innovation ; it was then</l>
     <l n="115">He spake of mischief made by restless men :</l>
     <l n="116">Not by new doctrines : never in his life</l>
     <l n="117">Would he attend to controversial strife ;</l>
     <l n="118">For sects he cared not ; " They are not of us ,</l>
     <l n="119">Nor need we , brethren , their concerns discuss ;</l>
     <l n="120">But ‘ tis the change , the schism at home I feel ;</l>
     <l n="121">Ills few perceive , and none have skill to heal :</l>
     <l n="122">Not at the altar our young brethren read</l>
     <l n="123">( Facing their flock ) the decalogue and creed ;</l>
     <l n="124">But at their duty , in their desks they stand ,</l>
     <l n="125">With naked surplice , lacking hood and band :</l>
     <l n="126">Churches are now of holy song bereft ,</l>
     <l n="127">And half our ancient customs changed or left ;</l>
     <l n="128">Few sprigs of ivy are at Christmas seen ,</l>
     <l n="129">Nor crimson berry tips the holly 's green ;</l>
     <l n="130">Mistaken choirs refuse the solemn strain</l>
     <l n="131">Of ancient Sternhold , which from ours amain</l>
     <l n="132">Comes flying forth from aisle to aisle about ,</l>
     <l n="133">Sweet links of harmony and long drawn out . ”</l>
     <l n="134">These were to him essentials ; all things new</l>
     <l n="135">He deemed superfluous , useless , or untrue :</l>
     <l n="136">To all beside indifferent , easy , cold ,</l>
     <l n="137">Here the fire kindled , and the woe was told .</l>
     <l n="138">Habit with him was all the test of truth :</l>
     <l n="139">“ It must be right : I 've done it from my youth . ”</l>
     <l n="140">Questions he answer 'd in as brief a way :</l>
     <l n="141">“ It must be wrong — it was of yesterday . ”</l>
     <l n="142">Though mild benevolence our Priest possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="143">‘ Twas but by wishes or by words expressed .</l>
     <l n="144">Circles in water , as they wider flow ,</l>
     <l n="145">The less conspicuous in their progress grow ,</l>
     <l n="146">And when at last they touch upon the shore ,</l>
     <l n="147">Distinction ceases , and they 're view 'd no more .</l>
     <l n="148">His love , like that last circle , all embraced ,</l>
     <l n="149">But with effect that never could be traced .</l>
     <l n="150">Now rests our Vicar . They who knew him best ,</l>
     <l n="151">Proclaim his life t'have been entirely rest ;</l>
     <l n="152">Free from all evils which disturb his mind</l>
     <l n="153">Whom studies vex and controversies blind .</l>
     <l n="154">The rich approved ,— of them in awe he stood ;</l>
     <l n="155">The poor admired ,— they all believed him good ;</l>
     <l n="156">The old and serious of his habits spoke ;</l>
     <l n="157">The frank and youthful loved his pleasant joke ;</l>
     <l n="158">Mothers approved a safe contented guest ,</l>
     <l n="159">And daughters one who back 'd each small request ;</l>
     <l n="160">In him his flock found nothing to condemn ;</l>
     <l n="161">Him sectaries liked ,— he never troubled them :</l>
     <l n="162">No trifles fail 'd his yielding mind to please ,</l>
     <l n="163">And all his passions sunk in early ease ;</l>
     <l n="164">Nor one so old has left this world of sin ,</l>
     <l n="165">More like the being that he entered in .</l>

    <head>THE CURATE .</head>
     <l n="1">ASK you what lands our Pastor tithes ?— Alas !</l>
     <l n="2">But few our acres , and but short our grass :</l>
     <l n="3">In some fat pastures of the rich , indeed ,</l>
     <l n="4">May roll the single cow or favourite steed ;</l>
     <l n="5">Who , stable-fed , is here for pleasure seen ,</l>
     <l n="6">His sleek sides bathing in the dewy green ;</l>
     <l n="7">But these , our hilly heath and common wide</l>
     <l n="8">Yield a slight portion for the parish-guide ;</l>
     <l n="9">No crops luxuriant in our borders stand ,</l>
     <l n="10">For here we plough the ocean , not the land ;</l>
     <l n="11">Still reason wills that we our Pastor pay ,</l>
     <l n="12">And custom does it on a certain day :</l>
     <l n="13">Much is the duty , small the legal due ,</l>
     <l n="14">And this with grateful minds we keep in view ;</l>
     <l n="15">Each makes his off'ring , some by habit led ,</l>
     <l n="16">Some by the thought that all men must be fed ;</l>
     <l n="17">Duty and love , and piety and pride ,</l>
     <l n="18">Have each their force , and for the Priest provide .</l>
     <l n="19">Not thus our Curate , one whom all believe</l>
     <l n="20">Pious and just , and for whose fate they grieve ;</l>
     <l n="21">All see him poor , but e'en the vulgar know</l>
     <l n="22">He merits love , and their respect bestow .</l>
     <l n="23">A man so learn 'd you shall but seldom see ,</l>
     <l n="24">Nor one so honour 'd , so aggrieved as he ; -</l>
     <l n="25">Not grieved by years alone ; though his appear</l>
     <l n="26">Dark and more dark ; severer on severe :</l>
     <l n="27">Not in his need ,— and yet we all must grant</l>
     <l n="28">How painful ‘ tis for feeling Age to want :</l>
     <l n="29">Nor in his body 's sufferings ; yet we know</l>
     <l n="30">Where Time has ploughed , there Misery loves to sow ;</l>
     <l n="31">But in the wearied mind , that all in vain</l>
     <l n="32">Wars with distress , and struggles with its pain .</l>
     <l n="33">His father saw his powers — “ I give , ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="34">“ My first-born learning ; ‘ twill a portion be : ”</l>
     <l n="35">Unhappy gift ! a portion for a son !</l>
     <l n="36">But all he had : — he learn 'd , and was undone !</l>
     <l n="37">Better , apprenticed to an humble trade ,</l>
     <l n="38">Had he the cassock for the priesthood made ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or thrown the shuttle , or the saddle shaped ,</l>
     <l n="40">And all these pangs of feeling souls escaped .</l>
     <l n="41">He once had hope — Hope , ardent , lively , light ;</l>
     <l n="42">His feelings pleasant , and his prospects bright :</l>
     <l n="43">Eager of fame , he read , he thought , he wrote ,</l>
     <l n="44">Weigh 'd the Greek page , and added note on note .</l>
     <l n="45">At morn , at evening , at his work was he ,</l>
     <l n="46">And dream 'd what his Euripides would be .</l>
     <l n="47">Then care began : — he loved , he woo 'd , he wed ;</l>
     <l n="48">Hope cheer 'd him still , and Hymen bless 'd his bed -</l>
     <l n="49">A curate 's bed ! then came the woeful years ;</l>
     <l n="50">The husband 's terrors , and the father 's tears ;</l>
     <l n="51">A wife grown feeble , mourning , pining , vex 'd</l>
     <l n="52">With wants and woes — by daily cares perplex 'd ;</l>
     <l n="53">No more a help , a smiling , soothing aid ,</l>
     <l n="54">But boding , drooping , sickly , and afraid .</l>
     <l n="55">A kind physician , and without a fee ,</l>
     <l n="56">Gave his opinion — “ Send her to the sea . ”</l>
     <l n="57">“ Alas ! ” the good man answer 'd , “ can I send</l>
     <l n="58">A friendless woman ? Can I find a friend ?</l>
     <l n="59">No ; I must with her , in her need , repair</l>
     <l n="60">To that new place ; the poor lie everywhere ; -</l>
     <l n="61">Some priest will pay me for my pious pains : ” -</l>
     <l n="62">He said , he came , and here he yet remains .</l>
     <l n="63">Behold his dwelling ! this poor hut he hires ,</l>
     <l n="64">Where he from view , though not from want , retires ;</l>
     <l n="65">Where four fair daughters , and five sorrowing sons ,</l>
     <l n="66">Partake his sufferings , and dismiss his duns ;</l>
     <l n="67">All join their efforts , and in patience learn</l>
     <l n="68">To want the comforts they aspire to earn ;</l>
     <l n="69">For the sick mother something they 'd obtain ,</l>
     <l n="70">To soothe her grief and mitigate her pain ;</l>
     <l n="71">For the sad father something they 'd procure</l>
     <l n="72">To ease the burden they themselves endure .</l>
     <l n="73">Virtues like these at once delight and press</l>
     <l n="74">On the fond father with a proud distress ;</l>
     <l n="75">On all around he looks with care and love ,</l>
     <l n="76">Grieved to behold , but happy to approve .</l>
     <l n="77">Then from his care , his love , his grief , he steals ,</l>
     <l n="78">And by himself an Author 's pleasure feels :</l>
     <l n="79">Each line detains him ; he omits not one ,</l>
     <l n="80">And all the sorrows of his state are gone . -</l>
     <l n="81">Alas ! even then , in that delicious hour ,</l>
     <l n="82">He feels his fortune , and laments its power .</l>
     <l n="83">Some Tradesman 's bill his wandering eyes engage ,</l>
     <l n="84">Some scrawl for payment thrust ‘ twixt page and page ;</l>
     <l n="85">Some bold , loud rapping at his humble door ,</l>
     <l n="86">Some surly message he has heard before ,</l>
     <l n="87">Awake , alarm , and tell him he is poor .</l>
     <l n="88">An angry Dealer , vulgar , rich , and proud ,</l>
     <l n="89">Thinks of his bill , and , passing , raps aloud ;</l>
     <l n="90">The elder daughter meekly makes him way -</l>
     <l n="91">“ I want my money , and I cannot stay :</l>
     <l n="92">My mill is stopp 'd ; what , Miss ! I cannot grind ;</l>
     <l n="93">Go tell your father he must raise the wind : ”</l>
     <l n="94">Still trembling , troubled , the dejected maid</l>
     <l n="95">Says , “ Sir ! my father ! ” — and then stops afraid :</l>
     <l n="96">E'en his hard heart is soften 'd , and he hears</l>
     <l n="97">Her voice with pity ; he respects her tears ;</l>
     <l n="98">His stubborn features half admit a smile ,</l>
     <l n="99">And his tone softens — “ Well ! I 'll wait awhile . ”</l>
     <l n="100">Pity ! a man so good , so mild , so meek ,</l>
     <l n="101">At such an age , should have his bread to seek ;</l>
     <l n="102">And all those rude and fierce attacks to dread .</l>
     <l n="103">That are more harrowing than the want of bread ;</l>
     <l n="104">Ah ! who shall whisper to that misery peace !</l>
     <l n="105">And say that want and insolence shall cease ?</l>
     <l n="106">“ But why not publish ? ” — those who know too well ,</l>
     <l n="107">Dealers in Greek , are fearful ‘ twill not sell ;</l>
     <l n="108">Then he himself is timid , troubled , slow ,</l>
     <l n="109">Nor likes his labours nor his griefs to show ;</l>
     <l n="110">The hope of fame may in his heart have place ,</l>
     <l n="111">But he has dread and horror of disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="112">Nor has he that confiding , easy way ,</l>
     <l n="113">That might his learning and himself display ;</l>
     <l n="114">But to his work he from the world retreats ,</l>
     <l n="115">And frets and glories o'er the favourite sheets .</l>
     <l n="116">But see ! the Man himself ; and sure I trace</l>
     <l n="117">Signs of new joy exulting in that face</l>
     <l n="118">O'er care that sleeps — we err , or we discern</l>
     <l n="119">Life in thy looks — the reason may we learn ?</l>
     <l n="120">“ Yes , ” he replied , “ I 'm happy , I confess ,</l>
     <l n="121">To learn that some are pleased with happiness</l>
     <l n="122">Which others feel — there are who now combine</l>
     <l n="123">The worthiest natures in the best design ,</l>
     <l n="124">To aid the letter 'd poor , and soothe such ills as mine .</l>
     <l n="125">We who more keenly feel the world 's contempt ,</l>
     <l n="126">And from its miseries are the least exempt ;</l>
     <l n="127">Now Hope shall whisper to the wounded breast</l>
     <l n="128">And Grief , in soothing expectation , rest .</l>
     <l n="129">“ Yes , I am taught that men who think , who feel ,</l>
     <l n="130">Unite the pains of thoughtful men to heal ;</l>
     <l n="131">Not with disdainful pride , whose bounties make</l>
     <l n="132">The needy curse the benefits they take ;</l>
     <l n="133">Not with the idle vanity that knows</l>
     <l n="134">Only a selfish joy when it bestows ;</l>
     <l n="135">Not with o'erbearing wealth , that , in disdain ,</l>
     <l n="136">Hurls the superfluous bliss at groaning pain ;</l>
     <l n="137">But these are men who yield such blest relief ,</l>
     <l n="138">That with the grievance they destroy the grief ;</l>
     <l n="139">Their timely aid the needy sufferers find ,</l>
     <l n="140">Their generous manner soothes the suffering mind ;</l>
     <l n="141">There is a gracious bounty , form 'd to raise</l>
     <l n="142">Him whom it aids ; their charity is praise ;</l>
     <l n="143">A common bounty may relieve distress ,</l>
     <l n="144">But whom the vulgar succour they oppress ;</l>
     <l n="145">This though a favour is an honour too ,</l>
     <l n="146">Though Mercy 's duty , yet ‘ tis Merit 's due ;</l>
     <l n="147">When our relief from such resources rise ,</l>
     <l n="148">All painful sense of obligation dies ;</l>
     <l n="149">And grateful feelings in the bosom wake ,</l>
     <l n="150">For ‘ tis their offerings , not their alms we take .</l>
     <l n="151">“ Long may these founts of Charity remain ,</l>
     <l n="152">And never shrink , but to be fill 'd again ;</l>
     <l n="153">True ! to the Author they are now confined ,</l>
     <l n="154">To him who gave the treasure of his mind ,</l>
     <l n="155">His time , his health ,— and thankless found mankind :</l>
     <l n="156">But there is hope that from these founts may flow</l>
     <l n="157">A side-way stream , and equal good bestow ;</l>
     <l n="158">Good that may reach us , whom the day 's distress</l>
     <l n="159">Keeps from the fame and perils of the Press ;</l>
     <l n="160">Whom Study beckons from the Ills of Life ,</l>
     <l n="161">And they from Study ; melancholy strife !</l>
     <l n="162">Who then can say , but bounty now so free ,</l>
     <l n="163">And so diffused , may find its way to me ?</l>
     <l n="164">“ Yes ! I may see my decent table yet</l>
     <l n="165">Cheer 'd with the meal that adds not to my debt ;</l>
     <l n="166">May talk of those to whom so much we owe ,</l>
     <l n="167">And guess their names whom yet we may not know ;</l>
     <l n="168">Blest , we shall say , are those who thus can give ,</l>
     <l n="169">And next who thus upon the bounty live ;</l>
     <l n="170">Then shall I close with thanks my humble meal .</l>
     <l n="171">And feel so well — Oh , God ! how shall I feel ! ” { 2 }</l>

     <l n="13">“ SECTS in Religion ? ” — Yes of every race</l>
     <l n="14">We nurse some portion in our favour 'd place ;</l>
     <l n="15">Not one warm preacher of one growing sect</l>
     <l n="16">Can say our Borough treats him with neglect :</l>
     <l n="17">Frequent as fashions they with us appear ,</l>
     <l n="18">And you might ask , “ how think we for the year ? ”</l>
     <l n="19">They come to us as riders in a trade ,</l>
     <l n="20">And with much art exhibit and persuade .</l>
     <l n="21">Minds are for Sects of various kinds decreed ,</l>
     <l n="22">As diff'rent soils are formed for diff'rent seed ;</l>
     <l n="23">Some when converted sigh in sore amaze ,</l>
     <l n="24">And some are wrapt in joy 's ecstatic blaze ;</l>
     <l n="25">Others again will change to each extreme ,</l>
     <l n="26">They know not why — as hurried in a dream ;</l>
     <l n="27">Unstable , they , like water , take all forms ,</l>
     <l n="28">Are quick and stagnant ; have their calms and storms ;</l>
     <l n="29">High on the hills , they in the sunbeams glow ,</l>
     <l n="30">Then muddily they move debased and slow ;</l>
     <l n="31">Or cold and frozen rest , and neither rise nor flow .</l>
     <l n="32">Yet none the cool and prudent Teacher prize .</l>
     <l n="33">On him ther dote who wakes their ectasies ;</l>
     <l n="34">With passions ready primed such guide they meet ,</l>
     <l n="35">And warm and kindle with th ’ imparted heat ;</l>
     <l n="36">‘ Tis he who wakes the nameless strong desire ,</l>
     <l n="37">The melting rapture and the glowing fire ;</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Tis he who pierces deep the tortured breast ,</l>
     <l n="39">And stirs the terrors never more to rest .</l>
     <l n="40">Opposed to these we have a prouder kind ,</l>
     <l n="41">Rash without heat , and without raptures blind ;</l>
     <l n="42">These our Glad Tidings unconcern 'd peruse ,</l>
     <l n="43">Search without awe , and without fear refuse ;</l>
     <l n="44">The truths , the blessings found in Sacred Writ ,</l>
     <l n="45">Call forth their spleen , and exercise their wit ;</l>
     <l n="46">Respect from these nor saints nor martyrs gain ,</l>
     <l n="47">The zeal they scorn , and they deride the pain :</l>
     <l n="48">And take their transient , cool , contemptuous view ,</l>
     <l n="49">Of that which must be tried , and doubtless may be true .</l>
     <l n="50">Friends of our Faith we have , whom doubts like these ,</l>
     <l n="51">And keen remarks , and bold objections please ;</l>
     <l n="52">They grant such doubts have weaker minds oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="53">Till sound conviction gave the troubled rest .</l>
     <l n="54">“ But still , ” they cry , “ let none their censures spare .</l>
     <l n="55">They but confirm the glorious hopes we share ;</l>
     <l n="56">From doubt , disdain , derision , scorn , and lies ,</l>
     <l n="57">With five-fold triumph sacred Truth shall rise . ”</l>
     <l n="58">Yes ! I allow , so Truth shall stand at last ,</l>
     <l n="59">And gain fresh glory by the conflict past : -</l>
     <l n="60">As Solway-Moss ( a barren mass and cold ,</l>
     <l n="61">Death to the seed , and poison to the fold ) ,</l>
     <l n="62">The smiling plain and fertile vale o'erlaid ,</l>
     <l n="63">Choked the green sod , and kill 'd the springing blade ;</l>
     <l n="64">That , changed by culture , may in time be seen</l>
     <l n="65">Enrich 'd by golden grain and pasture green ;</l>
     <l n="66">And these fair acres rented and enjoy 'd</l>
     <l n="67">May those excel by Solway-Moss destroy 'd .</l>
     <l n="68">Still must have mourn 'd the tenant of the day ,</l>
     <l n="69">For hopes destroy 'd , and harvests swept away ;</l>
     <l n="70">To him the gain of future years unknown ,</l>
     <l n="71">The instant grief and suffering were his own :</l>
     <l n="72">So must I grieve for many a wounded heart ,</l>
     <l n="73">Chill 'd by those doubts which bolder minds impart :</l>
     <l n="74">Truth in the end shall shine divinely clear ,</l>
     <l n="75">But sad the darkness till those times appear ;</l>
     <l n="76">Contests for truth , as wars for freedom , yield</l>
     <l n="77">Glory and joy to those who gain the field :</l>
     <l n="78">But still the Christian must in pity sigh</l>
     <l n="79">For all who suffer , and uncertain die .</l>
     <l n="80">Here are , who all the Church maintains approve ,</l>
     <l n="81">But yet the Church herself they will not love ;</l>
     <l n="82">In angry speech , they blame the carnal tie</l>
     <l n="83">Which pure Religion lost her spirit by ;</l>
     <l n="84">What time from prisons , flames , and tortures led ,</l>
     <l n="85">She slumber 'd careless in a royal bed ;</l>
     <l n="86">To make , they add , the Church 's glory shine ,</l>
     <l n="87">Should Diocletian reign , not Constantine .</l>
     <l n="88">“ In pomp , ” they cry , “ is “ England 's Church array 'd ,</l>
     <l n="89">Her cool Reformers wrought like men afraid ;</l>
     <l n="90">We would have pull 'd her gorgeous temples down ,</l>
     <l n="91">And spurn 'd her mitre , and defiled her gown :</l>
     <l n="92">We would have trodden low both bench and stall ,</l>
     <l n="93">Nor left a tithe remaining , great or small . ”</l>
     <l n="94">Let us be serious — Should such trials come .</l>
     <l n="95">Are they themselves prepared for martyrdom ?</l>
     <l n="96">It seems to us that our reformers knew</l>
     <l n="97">Th ’ important work they undertook to do ;</l>
     <l n="98">An equal priesthood they were loth to try ,</l>
     <l n="99">Lest zeal and care should with ambition die ;</l>
     <l n="100">To them it seem 'd that , take the tenth away ,</l>
     <l n="101">Yet priests must eat , and you must feed or pay :</l>
     <l n="102">Would they indeed , who hold such pay in scorn ,</l>
     <l n="103">Put on the muzzle when they tread the corn ?</l>
     <l n="104">Would they all , gratis , watch and tend the fold ,</l>
     <l n="105">Nor take one fleece to keep them from the cold ?</l>
     <l n="106">Men are not equal , and ‘ tis meet and right</l>
     <l n="107">That robes and titles our respect excite ;</l>
     <l n="108">Order requires it ; ‘ tis by vulgar pride</l>
     <l n="109">That such regard is censured and denied ;</l>
     <l n="110">Or by that false enthusiastic zeal ,</l>
     <l n="111">That thinks the Spirit will the priest reveal ,</l>
     <l n="112">And show to all men , by their powerful speech ,</l>
     <l n="113">Who are appointed and inspired to teach :</l>
     <l n="114">Alas ! could we the dangerous rule believe ,</l>
     <l n="115">Whom for their teacher should the crowd receive ?</l>
     <l n="116">Since all the varying kinds demand respect ,</l>
     <l n="117">All press you on to join their chosen sect ,</l>
     <l n="118">Although but in this single point agreed ,</l>
     <l n="119">“ Desert your churches and adopt our creed . ”</l>
     <l n="120">We know full well how much our forms offend</l>
     <l n="121">The burthen 'd Papist and the simple Friend :</l>
     <l n="122">Him , who new robes for every service takes ,</l>
     <l n="123">And who in drab and beaver sighs and shakes ;</l>
     <l n="124">He on the priest , whom hood and band adorn ,</l>
     <l n="125">Looks with the sleepy eye of silent scorn ;</l>
     <l n="126">But him I would not for my friend and guide ,</l>
     <l n="127">Who views such things with spleen , or wears with pride .</l>
     <l n="128">See next our several Sects ,— but first behold</l>
     <l n="129">The Church of Rome , who here is poor and old :</l>
     <l n="130">Use not triumphant raillery , or , at least ,</l>
     <l n="131">Let not thy mother be a whore and beast ;</l>
     <l n="132">Great was her pride indeed in ancient times ,</l>
     <l n="133">Yet shall we think of nothing but her crimes ?</l>
     <l n="134">Exalted high above all earthly things ,</l>
     <l n="135">She placed her foot upon the neck of kings ;</l>
     <l n="136">But some have deeply since avenged the crown ,</l>
     <l n="137">And thrown her glory and her honours down ;</l>
     <l n="138">Nor neck nor ear can she of kings command ,</l>
     <l n="139">Nor place a foot upon her own fair land .</l>
     <l n="140">Among her sons , with us a quiet few ,</l>
     <l n="141">Obscure themselves , her ancient state review ,</l>
     <l n="142">And fond and melancholy glances cast</l>
     <l n="143">On power insulted , and on triumph past :</l>
     <l n="144">They look , they can but look , with many a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="145">On sacred buildings doom 'd in dust to lie ;</l>
     <l n="146">“ On seats , ” they tell , “ where priests mid tapers dim</l>
     <l n="147">Breathed the warm prayer , or tuned the midnight hymn ;</l>
     <l n="148">Where trembling penitents their guilt confessed ,</l>
     <l n="149">Where want had succour , and contrition rest ;</l>
     <l n="150">There weary men from trouble found relief ,</l>
     <l n="151">There men in sorrow found repose from grief .</l>
     <l n="152">To scenes like these the fainting soul retired ;</l>
     <l n="153">Revenge and anger in these cells expired ;</l>
     <l n="154">By Pity soothed , Remorse lost half her fears ,</l>
     <l n="155">And soften 'd Pride dropp 'd penitential tears .</l>
     <l n="156">“ Then convent walls and nunnery spires arose ,</l>
     <l n="157">In pleasant spots which monk or abbot chose ;</l>
     <l n="158">When counts and barons saints devoted fed ,</l>
     <l n="159">And making cheap exchange , had pray'r for bread .</l>
     <l n="160">“ Now all is lost , the earth where abbeys stood</l>
     <l n="161">Is layman 's land , the glebe , the stream , the wood :</l>
     <l n="162">His oxen low where monks retired to eat ,</l>
     <l n="163">His cows repose upon the prior 's seat :</l>
     <l n="164">And wanton doves within the cloisters bill ,</l>
     <l n="165">Where the chaste votary warr 'd with wanton will . ”</l>
     <l n="166">Such is the change they mourn , but they restrain</l>
     <l n="167">The rage of grief , and passively complain .</l>
     <l n="168">We 've Baptists old and new ; forbear to ask</l>
     <l n="169">What the distinction — I decline the task ;</l>
     <l n="170">This I perceive , that when a sect grows old ,</l>

     <l n="469">And are you thankful ?— all is well my son . ’</l>
     <l n="470">“ A way far different ours — we thus surprise</l>
     <l n="471">A soul with questions , and demand replies :</l>
     <l n="472">‘ How dropp 'd you first , ’ I ask , ‘ the legal Yoke ?</l>
     <l n="473">What the first word the living Witness spoke ?</l>
     <l n="474">Perceived you thunders roar and lightnings shine ,</l>
     <l n="475">And tempests gathering ere the Birth divine ?</l>
     <l n="476">Did fire , and storm , and earthquake all appear</l>
     <l n="477">Before that still small voice , What dost thou here ?</l>
     <l n="478">Hast thou by day and night , and soon and late ,</l>
     <l n="479">Waited and watch 'd before Admission-gate ;</l>
     <l n="480">And so a pilgrim and a soldier pass 'd</l>
     <l n="481">To Sion 's hill through battle and through blast ?</l>
     <l n="482">Then in thy way didst thou thy foe attack ,</l>
     <l n="483">And mad'st thou proud Apollyon turn his back ? ’</l>
     <l n="484">“ Heart-searching things are these , and shake the mind ,</l>
     <l n="485">Yea , like the rustling of a mighty wind .</l>
     <l n="486">“ Thus would I ask : ‘ Nay , let me question now ,</l>
     <l n="487">How sink my sayings in your bosoms ? how ?</l>
     <l n="488">Feel you a quickening ? drops the subject deep ?</l>
     <l n="489">Stupid and stony , no ! you 're all asleep ;</l>
     <l n="490">Listless and lazy , waiting for a close ,</l>
     <l n="491">As if at church ;— do I allow repose ?</l>
     <l n="492">Am I a legal minister ? do I</l>
     <l n="493">With form or rubric , rule or rite comply ?</l>
     <l n="494">Then whence this quiet , tell me , I beseech ?</l>
     <l n="495">One might believe you heard your Rector preach ,</l>
     <l n="496">Or his assistant dreamer : — Oh ! return ,</l>
     <l n="497">Ye times of burning , when the heart would burn ;</l>
     <l n="498">Now hearts are ice , and you , my freezing fold ,</l>
     <l n="499">Have spirits sunk and sad , and bosoms stony-cold .</l>
     <l n="500">“ Oh ! now again for those prevailing powers ,</l>
     <l n="501">Which , once began this mighty work of ours ;</l>
     <l n="502">When the wide field , God 's Temple , was the place ,</l>
     <l n="503">And birds flew by to catch a breath of grace ;</l>
     <l n="504">When ‘ mid his timid friends and threat'ning foes ,</l>
     <l n="505">Our zealous chief as Paul at Athens rose :</l>
     <l n="506">When with infernal spite and knotty clubs</l>
     <l n="507">The Ill-One arm 'd his scoundrels and his scrubs ;</l>
     <l n="508">And there were flying all around the spot</l>
     <l n="509">Brands at the Preacher , but they touch 'd him not :</l>
     <l n="510">Stakes brought to smite him , threaten 'd in his cause ,</l>
     <l n="511">And tongues , attuned to curses , roar 'd applause ;</l>
     <l n="512">Louder and louder grew his awful tones ,</l>
     <l n="513">Sobbing and sighs were heard , and rueful groans ;</l>
     <l n="514">Soft women fainted , prouder man express 'd</l>
     <l n="515">Wonder and woe , and butchers smote the breast ;</l>
     <l n="516">Eyes wept , ears tingled ; stiff'ning on each head ,</l>
     <l n="517">The hair drew back , and Satan howl 'd and fled .</l>
     <l n="518">“ In that soft season when the gentle breeze</l>
     <l n="519">Rises all round , and swells by slow degrees ;</l>
     <l n="520">Till tempests gather , when through all the sky</l>
     <l n="521">The thunders rattle , and the lightnings fly ;</l>
     <l n="522">When rain in torrents wood and vale deform ,</l>
     <l n="523">And all is horror , hurricane , and storm :</l>
     <l n="524">“ So , when the Preacher in that glorious time ,</l>
     <l n="525">Than clouds more melting , more than storm sublime ,</l>
     <l n="526">Dropp 'd the new Word , there came a charm around ;</l>
     <l n="527">Tremors and terrors rose upon the sound ;</l>
     <l n="528">The stubborn spirits by his force he broke ,</l>
     <l n="529">As the fork 'd lightning rives the knotted oak :</l>
     <l n="530">Fear , hope , dismay , all signs of shame or grace ,</l>
     <l n="531">Chain 'd every foot , or featured every face ;</l>
     <l n="532">Then took his sacred trump a louder swell ,</l>
     <l n="533">And now they groan 'd , they sicken 'd , and they fell ;</l>
     <l n="534">Again he sounded , and we heard the cry</l>
     <l n="535">Of the Word-wounded , as about to die ;</l>
     <l n="536">Further and further spread the conquering word ,</l>
     <l n="537">As loud he cried — ‘ The Battle of the Lord . ’</l>
     <l n="538">E'en those apart who were the sound denied ,</l>
     <l n="539">Fell down instinctive , and in spirit died .</l>
     <l n="540">Nor stay 'd he yet — his eye , his frown , his speech ,</l>
     <l n="541">His very gesture , had a power to teach :</l>
     <l n="542">With outstretch 'd arms , strong voice , and piercing call ,</l>
     <l n="543">He won the field , and made the Dagons fall ;</l>
     <l n="544">And thus in triumph took his glorious way ,</l>
     <l n="545">Through scenes of horror , terror , and dismay . ”</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The Evils of the Contest , and how in part to be avoided — The</l>

     <l n="9">he was raised to the Government of the Borough — These Evils not to</l>

     <l n="12">YES , our Election 's past , and we 've been free ,</l>
     <l n="13">Somewhat as madmen without keepers be ;</l>
     <l n="14">And such desire of Freedom has been shown ,</l>
     <l n="15">That both the parties wish 'd her all their own :</l>
     <l n="16">All our free smiths and cobblers in the town</l>
     <l n="17">Were loth to lay such pleasant freedom down ;</l>
     <l n="18">To put the bludgeon and cockade aside ,</l>
     <l n="19">And let us pass unhurt and undefied .</l>
     <l n="20">True ! you might then your party 's sign produce ,</l>
     <l n="21">And so escape with only half th ’ abuse :</l>
     <l n="22">With half the danger as you walk 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="23">With rage and threat'ning but from half the throng .</l>
     <l n="24">This you might do , and not your fortune mend ,</l>
     <l n="25">For where you lost a foe you gain 'd a friend ;</l>
     <l n="26">And to distress you , vex you , and expose ,</l>
     <l n="27">Election-friends are worse than any foes ;</l>
     <l n="28">The party-curse is with the canvass past ,</l>
     <l n="29">But party-friendship , for jour grief , will last .</l>
     <l n="30">Friends of all kinds ; the civil and the rude ,</l>
     <l n="31">Who humbly wish , or boldly dare t'intrude :</l>
     <l n="32">These beg or take a liberty to come</l>
     <l n="33">( Friends should be free ) , and make your house their home ;</l>
     <l n="34">They know that warmly you their cause espouse ,</l>
     <l n="35">And come to make their boastings and their bows ;</l>
     <l n="36">You scorn their manners , you their words mistrust ,</l>
     <l n="37">But you must hear them , and they know you must .</l>
     <l n="38">One plainly sees a friendship firm and true ,</l>
     <l n="39">Between the noble candidate and you ;</l>
     <l n="40">So humbly begs ( and states at large the case ) ,</l>
     <l n="41">“ You 'll think of Bobby and the little place . ”</l>
     <l n="42">Stifling his shame by drink , a wretch will come ,</l>
     <l n="43">And prate your wife and daughter from the room :</l>
     <l n="44">In pain you hear him , and at heart despise ,</l>
     <l n="45">Yet with heroic mind your pangs disguise ;</l>
     <l n="46">And still in patience to the sot attend ,</l>
     <l n="47">To show what man can bear to serve a friend .</l>
     <l n="48">One enters hungry — not to be denied ,</l>
     <l n="49">And takes his place and jokes — “ We 're of a side . ”</l>
     <l n="50">Yet worse , the proser who , upon the strength</l>
     <l n="51">Of his one vote , has tales of three hours ’ length ;</l>
     <l n="52">This sorry rogue you bear , yet with surprise</l>
     <l n="53">Start at his oaths , and sicken at his lies .</l>
     <l n="54">Then comes there one , and tells in friendly way</l>
     <l n="55">What the opponents in their anger say ;</l>
     <l n="56">All that through life has vex 'd you , all abuse ,</l>
     <l n="57">Will this kind friend in pure regard produce ;</l>
     <l n="58">And having through your own offences run ,</l>
     <l n="59">Adds ( as appendage ) what your friends have done ,</l>
     <l n="60">Has any female cousin made a trip</l>
     <l n="61">To Gretna Green , or more vexatious slip ?</l>
     <l n="62">Has your wife 's brother , or your uncle 's son ,</l>
     <l n="63">Done aught amiss , or is he thought t'have done ?</l>
     <l n="64">Is there of all your kindred some who lack</l>
     <l n="65">Vision direct , or have a gibbous back ?</l>
     <l n="66">From your unlucky name may quips and puns</l>
     <l n="67">Be made by these upbraiding Goths and Huns ?</l>
     <l n="68">To some great public character have you</l>
     <l n="69">Assigned the fame to worth and talents due ,</l>
     <l n="70">Proud of your praise ?— In this , in any case ,</l>
     <l n="71">Where the brute-spirit may affix disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="72">These friends will smiling bring it , and the while</l>
     <l n="73">You silent sit , and practise for a smile .</l>
     <l n="74">Vain of their power , and of their value sure ,</l>
     <l n="75">They nearly guess the tortures you endure ;</l>
     <l n="76">Nor spare one pang — for they perceive your heart</l>
     <l n="77">Goes with the cause ; you 'd die before you 'd start ;</l>
     <l n="78">Do what they may , they 're sure you 'll not offend</l>
     <l n="79">Men who have pledged their honours to your friend .</l>
     <l n="80">Those friends indeed , who start as in a race ,</l>
     <l n="81">May love the sport , and laugh at this disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="82">They have in view the glory and the prize ,</l>
     <l n="83">Nor heed the dirty steps by which they rise :</l>
     <l n="84">But we their poor associates lose the fame ,</l>
     <l n="85">Though more than partners in the toil and shame .</l>
     <l n="86">Were this the whole ; and did the time produce</l>
     <l n="87">But shame and toil , but riot and abuse ;</l>
     <l n="88">We might be then from serious griefs exempt ,</l>
     <l n="89">And view the whole with pity and contempt .</l>
     <l n="90">Alas ! but here the vilest passions rule ;</l>
     <l n="91">It is Seduction 's , is Temptation 's school ;</l>
     <l n="92">Where vices mingle in the oddest ways ,</l>
     <l n="93">The grossest slander and the dirtiest praise ;</l>
     <l n="94">Flattery enough to make the vainest sick ,</l>
     <l n="95">And clumsy stratagem , and scoundrel trick :</l>
     <l n="96">Nay more , your anger and contempt to cause ,</l>
     <l n="97">These , while they fish for profit , claim applause ;</l>
     <l n="98">Bribed , bought , and bound , they banish shame and fear ;</l>
     <l n="99">Tell you they 're staunch , and have a soul sincere ;</l>
     <l n="100">Then talk of honour , and , if doubt 's express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="101">Show where it lies , and smite upon the breast .</l>
     <l n="102">Among these worthies , some at first declare</l>
     <l n="103">For whom they vote : he then has most to spare ;</l>
     <l n="104">Others hang off — when coming to the post</l>
     <l n="105">Is spurring time , and then he 'll spare the most :</l>
     <l n="106">While some demurring , wait , and find at last</l>
     <l n="107">The bidding languish , and the market past ;</l>
     <l n="108">These will affect all bribery to condemn ,</l>
     <l n="109">And be it Satan laughs , he laughs at them .</l>
     <l n="110">Some too are pious — One desired the Lord</l>
     <l n="111">To teach him where “ to drop his little word ;</l>
     <l n="112">To lend his vote where it will profit best ;</l>
     <l n="113">Promotion came not from the east or west ;</l>
     <l n="114">But as their freedom had promoted some ,</l>
     <l n="115">He should be glad to know which way ‘ twould come .</l>
     <l n="116">It was a naughty world , and where to sell</l>
     <l n="117">His precious charge , was more than he could tell . ”</l>
     <l n="118">“ But you succeeded ? ” — True , at mighty cost ,</l>
     <l n="119">And our good friend , I fear , will think he 's lost :</l>
     <l n="120">Inns , horses , chaises , dinners , balls , and notes ;</l>
     <l n="121">What fill 'd their purses , and what drench 'd their throats ;</l>
     <l n="122">The private pension , and indulgent lease , -</l>
     <l n="123">Have all been granted to these friends who fleece ;</l>
     <l n="124">Friends who will hang like burs upon his coat ,</l>
     <l n="125">And boundless judge the value of a vote .</l>
     <l n="126">And though the terrors of the time be pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="127">There still remain the scatterings of the blast ;</l>
     <l n="128">The boughs are parted that entwined before ,</l>
     <l n="129">And ancient harmony exists no more ;</l>
     <l n="130">The gusts of wrath our peaceful seats deform ,</l>
     <l n="131">And sadly flows the sighing of the storm :</l>
     <l n="132">Those who have gain 'd are sorry for the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="133">But they who lost , unwilling peace should come ;</l>
     <l n="134">There open envy , here suppress 'd delight ,</l>
     <l n="135">Yet live till time shall better thoughts excite ,</l>
     <l n="136">And so prepare us , by a six-years ’ truce ,</l>
     <l n="137">Again for riot , insult , and abuse .</l>
     <l n="138">Our worthy Mayor , on the victorious part ,</l>
     <l n="139">Cries out for peace , and cries with all his heart ;</l>
     <l n="140">He , civil creature ! ever does his best</l>
     <l n="141">To banish wrath from every voter 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="142">“ For where , ” says he , with reason strong and plain ,</l>
     <l n="143">“ Where is the profit ? what will anger gain ? ”</l>
     <l n="144">His short stout person he is wont to brace</l>
     <l n="145">In good brown broad-cloth , edg 'd with two-inch lace ,</l>
     <l n="146">When in his seat ; and still the coat seems new ,</l>
     <l n="147">Preserved by common use of seaman 's blue .</l>
     <l n="148">He was a fisher from his earliest day ,</l>
     <l n="149">And placed his nets within the Borough 's bay ;</l>
     <l n="150">Where , by his skates , his herrings , and his soles ,</l>
     <l n="151">He lived , nor dream 'd of Corporation-Doles ;</l>
     <l n="152">But toiling saved , and saving , never ceased</l>
     <l n="153">Till he had box 'd up twelvescore pounds at least :</l>
     <l n="154">He knew not money 's power , but judged it best</l>
     <l n="155">Safe in his trunk to let his treasure rest ;</l>
     <l n="156">Yet to a friend complain 'd : “ Sad charge , to keep</l>
     <l n="157">So many pounds ; and then I cannot sleep : ”</l>
     <l n="158">“ Then put it out , ” replied the friend : — “ What , give</l>
     <l n="159">My money up ? why then I could not live : ”</l>
     <l n="160">“ Nay , but for interest place it in his hands</l>
     <l n="161">Who 'll give you mortgage on his house or lands . ”</l>
     <l n="162">“ Oh but , ” said Daniel , “ that 's a dangerous plan ;</l>
     <l n="163">He may be robb 'd like any other man : ”</l>
     <l n="164">“ Still he is bound , and you may be at rest ,</l>
     <l n="165">More safe the money than within your chest ;</l>
     <l n="166">And you 'll receive , from all deductions clear ,</l>
     <l n="167">Five pounds for every hundred , every year . ”</l>
     <l n="168">“ What good in that ? ” quoth Daniel , “ for ‘ tis plain ,</l>
     <l n="169">If part I take , there can but part remain : ”</l>
     <l n="170">“ What ! you , my friend , so skill 'd in gainful things ,</l>
     <l n="171">Have you to learn what Interest money brings ? ”</l>
     <l n="172">“ Not so , ” said Daniel , “ perfectly I know ,</l>
     <l n="173">He 's the most interest who has most to show . ”</l>
     <l n="174">“ True ! and he 'll show the more the more he lends ;</l>
     <l n="175">Thus he his weight and consequence extends ;</l>
     <l n="176">For they who borrow must restore each sum ,</l>
     <l n="177">And pay for use . What , Daniel , art thou dumb ? ”</l>
     <l n="178">For much amazed was that good man .— “ Indeed ! ”</l>
     <l n="179">Said he with gladd'ning eye , “ will money breed ?</l>
     <l n="180">How have I lived ? I grieve , with all my heart ,</l>
     <l n="181">For my late knowledge in this precious art : -</l>
     <l n="182">Five pounds for every hundred will he give ?</l>
     <l n="183">And then the hundred ?— I begin to live . ” -</l>
     <l n="184">So he began , and other means he found ,</l>
     <l n="185">As he went on , to multiply a pound :</l>
     <l n="186">Though blind so long to Interest , all allow</l>
     <l n="187">That no man better understands it now :</l>
     <l n="188">Him in our Body-Corporate we chose ,</l>
     <l n="189">And once among us , he above us rose ;</l>
     <l n="190">Stepping from post to post , he reach 'd the Chair ,</l>
     <l n="191">And there he now reposes — that 's the Mayor .</l>
     <l n="192">But ‘ tis not he , ‘ tis not the kinder few ,</l>
     <l n="193">The mild , the good , who can our peace renew ;</l>
     <l n="194">A peevish humour swells in every eye ,</l>
     <l n="195">The warm are angry , and the cool are shy ;</l>
     <l n="196">There is no more the social board at whist ,</l>
     <l n="197">The good old partners are with scorn dismiss 'd ;</l>
     <l n="198">No more with dog and lantern comes the maid ,</l>
     <l n="199">To guide the mistress when the rubber 's play 'd ;</l>
     <l n="200">Sad shifts are made lest ribands blue and green</l>
     <l n="201">Should at one table , at one time , be seen :</l>
     <l n="202">On care and merit none will now rely ,</l>
     <l n="203">‘ Tis Party sells what party-friends must buy ;</l>
     <l n="204">The warmest burgess wears a bodger 's coat ,</l>
     <l n="205">And fashion gains less int'rest than a vote ;</l>
     <l n="206">Uncheck 'd the vintner still his poison vends ,</l>

     <l n="208">But this admitted ; be it still agreed ,</l>
     <l n="209">These ill effects from noble cause proceed ;</l>
     <l n="210">Though like some vile excrescences they be ,</l>
     <l n="211">The tree they spring from is a sacred tree ,</l>
     <l n="212">And its true produce , Strength and Liberty .</l>
     <l n="213">Yet if we could th ’ attendant ills suppress ,</l>
     <l n="214">If we could make the sum of mischief less ;</l>
     <l n="215">If we could warm and angry men persuade</l>
     <l n="216">No more man 's common comforts to invade ;</l>
     <l n="217">And that old ease and harmony re-seat ,</l>
     <l n="218">In all our meetings , so in joy to meet ;</l>
     <l n="219">Much would of glory to the Muse ensue ,</l>
     <l n="220">And our good Vicar would have less to do .</l>

    <head>PROFESSIONS — LAW .</head>
     <l n="1">“ TRADES and Professions ” — these are themes the Muse ,</l>
     <l n="2">Left to her freedom , would forbear to choose ;</l>
     <l n="3">But to our Borough they in truth belong ,</l>
     <l n="4">And we , perforce , must take them in our song .</l>
     <l n="5">Be it then known that we can boast of these</l>
     <l n="6">In all denominations , ranks , degrees ;</l>
     <l n="7">All who our numerous wants through life supply ,</l>
     <l n="8">Who soothe us sick , attend us when we die ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or for the dead their various talents try .</l>
     <l n="10">Then have we those who live by secret arts ,</l>
     <l n="11">By hunting fortunes , and by stealing hearts ;</l>
     <l n="12">Or who by nobler means themselves advance ,</l>
     <l n="13">Or who subsist by charity and chance .</l>
     <l n="14">Say , of our native heroes shall I boast ,</l>
     <l n="15">Born in our streets , to thunder on our coast ,</l>
     <l n="16">Our Borough-seamen ? Could the timid Muse</l>
     <l n="17">More patriot ardour in their breasts infuse ;</l>
     <l n="18">Or could she paint their merit or their skill ,</l>
     <l n="19">She wants not love , alacrity , or will :</l>
     <l n="20">But needless all ; that ardour is their own ,</l>
     <l n="21">And for their deeds , themselves have made them known .</l>
     <l n="22">Soldiers in arms ! Defenders of our soil !</l>
     <l n="23">Who from destruction save us ; who from spoil</l>
     <l n="24">Protect the sons of peace , who traffic , or who toil ;</l>
     <l n="25">Would I could duly praise you ; that each deed</l>
     <l n="26">Your foes might honour , and your friends might read :</l>
     <l n="27">This too is needless ; you 've imprinted well</l>
     <l n="28">Your powers , and told what I should feebly tell :</l>
     <l n="29">Beside , a Muse like mine , to satire prone ,</l>
     <l n="30">Would fail in themes where there is praise alone .</l>
     <l n="31">- Law shall I sing , or what to Law belongs ?</l>
     <l n="32">Alas ! there may be danger in such songs ;</l>
     <l n="33">A foolish rhyme , ‘ tis said , a trifling thing ,</l>
     <l n="34">The law found treason , for it touch 'd the King .</l>
     <l n="35">But kings have mercy , in these happy times .</l>
     <l n="36">Or surely One had suffered for his rhymes ;</l>
     <l n="37">Our glorious Edwards and our Henrys bold ,</l>
     <l n="38">So touch 'd , had kept the reprobate in hold ;</l>
     <l n="39">But he escap 'd ,— nor fear , thank Heav'n , have I ,</l>
     <l n="40">Who love my king , for such offence to die .</l>
     <l n="41">But I am taught the danger would be much ,</l>
     <l n="42">If these poor lines should one attorney touch -</l>
     <l n="43">( One of those Limbs of Law who 're always here ;</l>
     <l n="44">The Heads come down to guide them twice a year . )</l>
     <l n="45">I might not swing , indeed , but he in sport</l>
     <l n="46">Would whip a rhymer on from court to court ;</l>
     <l n="47">Stop him in each , and make him pay for all</l>
     <l n="48">The long proceedings in that dreaded Hall : -</l>
     <l n="49">Then let my numbers flow discreetly on ,</l>
     <l n="50">Warn 'd by the fate of luckless Coddrington , { 3 }</l>
     <l n="51">Lest some attorney ( pardon me the name )</l>
     <l n="52">Should wound a poor solicitor for fame .</l>
     <l n="53">One Man of Law in George the Second 's reign</l>
     <l n="54">Was all our frugal fathers would maintain ;</l>
     <l n="55">He too was kept for forms ; a man of peace ,</l>
     <l n="56">To frame a contract , or to draw a lease :</l>
     <l n="57">He had a clerk , with whom he used to write</l>
     <l n="58">All the day long , with whom he drank at night ,</l>
     <l n="59">Spare was his visage , moderate his bill ,</l>
     <l n="60">And he so kind , men doubted of his skill .</l>
     <l n="61">Who thinks of this , with some amazement sees ,</l>
     <l n="62">For one so poor , three flourishing at ease ;</l>
     <l n="63">Nay , one in splendour ! see that mansion tall ,</l>
     <l n="64">That lofty door , the far-resounding hall ;</l>
     <l n="65">Well-furnish 'd rooms , plate shining on the board ,</l>
     <l n="66">Gay liveried lads , and cellar proudly stored :</l>
     <l n="67">Then say how comes it that such fortunes crown</l>
     <l n="68">These sons of strife , these terrors of the town ?</l>
     <l n="69">Lo ! that small Office ! there th ’ incautious guest</l>
     <l n="70">Goes blindfold in , and that maintains the rest ;</l>
     <l n="71">There in his web , th ’ observant spider lies ,</l>
     <l n="72">And peers about for fat intruding flies ;</l>
     <l n="73">Doubtful at first , he hears the distant hum ,</l>
     <l n="74">And feels them fluttering as they nearer come ;</l>
     <l n="75">They buzz and blink , and doubtfully they tread</l>
     <l n="76">On the strong bird-lime of the utmost thread ;</l>
     <l n="77">But when they 're once entangled by the gin ,</l>
     <l n="78">With what an eager clasp he draws them in ;</l>
     <l n="79">Nor shall they ‘ scape , till after long delay ,</l>
     <l n="80">And all that sweetens life is drawn away .</l>
     <l n="81">“ Nay , this , ” you cry , “ is common-place , the tale</l>
     <l n="82">Of petty tradesmen o'er their evening ale ;</l>
     <l n="83">There are who , living by the legal pen ,</l>
     <l n="84">Are held in honour ,— ‘ Honourable men ’ ”</l>
     <l n="85">Doubtless — there are who hold manorial courts ,</l>
     <l n="86">Or whom the trust of powerful friends supports ,</l>
     <l n="87">Or who , by labouring through a length of time ,</l>
     <l n="88">Have pick 'd their way , unsullied by a crime .</l>
     <l n="89">These are the few : in this , in every place ,</l>
     <l n="90">Fix the litigious rupture-stirring race ;</l>
     <l n="91">Who to contention as to trade are led ,</l>
     <l n="92">To whom dispute and strife are bliss and bread .</l>
     <l n="93">There is a doubtful Pauper , and we think</l>
     <l n="94">‘ Tis not with us to give him meat and drink ;</l>
     <l n="95">There is a Child ; and ‘ tis not mighty clear</l>
     <l n="96">Whether the mother lived with us a year :</l>
     <l n="97">A Road 's indicted , and our seniors doubt</l>
     <l n="98">If in our proper boundary or without :</l>
     <l n="99">But what says our attorney ? He , our friend ,</l>
     <l n="100">Tells us ‘ tis just and manly to contend .</l>
     <l n="101">“ What ! to a neighbouring parish yield your cause ,</l>
     <l n="102">While you have money , and the nation laws ?</l>
     <l n="103">What ! lose without a trial , that which , tried ,</l>
     <l n="104">May — nay it must — be given on our side ?</l>
     <l n="105">All men of spirit would contend ; such men</l>
     <l n="106">Than lose a pound would rather hazard ten .</l>
     <l n="107">What ! be imposed on ? No ! a British soul</l>
     <l n="108">Despises imposition , hates control :</l>
     <l n="109">The law is open ; let them , if they dare ,</l>
     <l n="110">Support their cause ; the Borough need not spare .</l>
     <l n="111">All I advise is vigour and good-will :</l>
     <l n="112">Is it agreed then — Shall I file a bill ? ”</l>
     <l n="113">The trader , grazier , merchant , priest , and all ,</l>
     <l n="114">Whose sons aspiring , to professions call ,</l>
     <l n="115">Choose from their lads some bold and subtle boy ,</l>
     <l n="116">And judge him fitted for this grave employ :</l>
     <l n="117">Him a keen old practitioner admits ,</l>
     <l n="118">To write five years and exercise his wits :</l>
     <l n="119">The youth has heard — it is in fact his creed -</l>
     <l n="120">Mankind dispute , that Lawyers may be fee 'd :</l>
     <l n="121">Jails , bailiffs , writs , all terms and threats of Law ,</l>
     <l n="122">Grow now familiar as once top and taw ;</l>
     <l n="123">Rage , hatred , fear , the mind 's severer ills ,</l>
     <l n="124">All bring employment , all augment his bills :</l>
     <l n="125">As feels the surgeon for the mangled limb ,</l>
     <l n="126">The mangled mind is but a job for him ;</l>
     <l n="127">Thus taught to think , these legal reasoners draw</l>
     <l n="128">Morals and maxims from their views of Law ;</l>
     <l n="129">They cease to judge by precepts taught in schools ,</l>
     <l n="130">By man 's plain sense , or by religious rules ;</l>
     <l n="131">No ! nor by law itself , in truth discern 'd ,</l>
     <l n="132">But as its statutes may be warp 'd and turn 'd :</l>
     <l n="133">How they should judge of man , his word and deed ,</l>
     <l n="134">They in their books and not their bosoms read :</l>
     <l n="135">Of some good act you speak with just applause ;</l>
     <l n="136">“ No , no ! ” says he , “ ‘ twould be a losing cause :</l>
     <l n="137">Blame you some tyrant 's deed ?— he answers “ Nay ,</l>
     <l n="138">He 'll get a verdict ; heed you what you say . ”</l>
     <l n="139">Thus to conclusions from examples led ,</l>
     <l n="140">The heart resigns all judgment to the head ;</l>
     <l n="141">Law , law alone for ever kept in view ,</l>
     <l n="142">His measures guides , and rules his conscience too ;</l>
     <l n="143">Of ten commandments , he confesses three</l>
     <l n="144">Are yet in force , and tells you which they be ,</l>
     <l n="145">As Law instructs him , thus : “ Your neighbour 's wife</l>
     <l n="146">You must not take , his chattles , nor his life ;</l>
     <l n="147">Break these decrees , for damage you must pay ;</l>
     <l n="148">These you must reverence , and the rest — you may . ”</l>
     <l n="149">Law was design 'd to keep a state in peace ;</l>
     <l n="150">To punish robbery , that wrong might cease ;</l>
     <l n="151">To be impregnable : a constant fort ,</l>
     <l n="152">To which the weak and injured might resort :</l>
     <l n="153">But these perverted minds its force employ ,</l>
     <l n="154">Not to protect mankind , but to annoy ;</l>
     <l n="155">And long as ammunition can be found ,</l>
     <l n="156">Its lightning flashes and its thunders sound .</l>
     <l n="157">Or Law with lawyers is an ample still ,</l>
     <l n="158">Wrought by the passions ’ heat with chymic skill :</l>
     <l n="159">While the fire burns , the gains are quickly made ,</l>
     <l n="160">And freely flow the profits of the trade ;</l>
     <l n="161">Nay , when the fierceness fails , these artists blow</l>
     <l n="162">The dying fire , and make the embers glow ,</l>
     <l n="163">As long as they can make the smaller profits flow :</l>
     <l n="164">At length the process of itself will stop ,</l>
     <l n="165">When they perceive they 've drawn out every drop .</l>
     <l n="166">Yet , I repeat , there are who nobly strive</l>
     <l n="167">To keep the sense of moral worth alive ;</l>
     <l n="168">Men who would starve , ere meanly deign to live</l>
     <l n="169">On what deception and chican'ry give ;</l>
     <l n="170">And these at length succeed ; they have their strife ,</l>
     <l n="171">Their apprehensions , stops , and rubs in life ;</l>
     <l n="172">But honour , application , care , and skill ,</l>
     <l n="173">Shall bend opposing fortune to their will .</l>
     <l n="174">Of such is Archer , he who keeps in awe</l>
     <l n="175">Contending parties by his threats of law :</l>
     <l n="176">He , roughly honest , has been long a guide</l>
     <l n="177">In Borough-business , on the conquering side ;</l>
     <l n="178">And seen so much of both sides , and so long ,</l>
     <l n="179">He thinks the bias of man 's mind goes wrong :</l>
     <l n="180">Thus , though he 's friendly , he is still severe ,</l>
     <l n="181">Surly , though kind , suspiciously sincere :</l>
     <l n="182">So much he 's seen of baseness in the mind ,</l>
     <l n="183">That , while a friend to man , he scorns mankind ;</l>
     <l n="184">He knows the human heart , and sees with dread ,</l>
     <l n="185">By slight temptation , how the strong are led ;</l>
     <l n="186">He knows how interest can asunder rend</l>
     <l n="187">The bond of parent , master , guardian , friend ,</l>
     <l n="188">To form a new and a degrading tie</l>
     <l n="189">‘ Twixt needy vice and tempting villainy .</l>
     <l n="190">Sound in himself , yet when such flaws appear ,</l>
     <l n="191">He doubts of all , and learns that self to fear :</l>
     <l n="192">For where so dark the moral view is grown ,</l>
     <l n="193">A timid conscience trembles for her own ;</l>
     <l n="194">The pitchy-taint of general vice is such</l>
     <l n="195">As daubs the fancy , and you dread the touch .</l>
     <l n="196">Far unlike him was one in former times ,</l>
     <l n="197">Famed for the spoil he gather 'd by his crimes ;</l>
     <l n="198">Who , while his brethren nibbling held their prey ,</l>
     <l n="199">He like an eagle seized and bore the whole away .</l>
     <l n="200">Swallow , a poor Attorney , brought his boy</l>
     <l n="201">Up at his desk , and gave him his employ ;</l>
     <l n="202">He would have bound him to an honest trade ,</l>
     <l n="203">Could preparations have been duly made .</l>
     <l n="204">The clerkship ended , both the sire and son</l>
     <l n="205">Together did what business could be done ;</l>
     <l n="206">Sometimes they 'd luck to stir up small disputes</l>
     <l n="207">Among their friends , and raise them into suits :</l>
     <l n="208">Though close and hard , the father was content</l>
     <l n="209">With this resource , now old and indolent :</l>
     <l n="210">But his young Swallow , gaping and alive</l>
     <l n="211">To fiercer feelings , was resolved to thrive : -</l>
     <l n="212">“ Father , ” he said , “ but little can they win ,</l>
     <l n="213">Who hunt in couples where the game is thin ;</l>
     <l n="214">Let 's part in peace , and each pursue his gain ,</l>
     <l n="215">Where it may start — our love may yet remain . ”</l>
     <l n="216">The parent growl 'd , he could n't think that love</l>
     <l n="217">Made the young cockatrice his den remove ;</l>
     <l n="218">But , taught by habit , he the truth suppress “ d ,</l>
     <l n="219">Forced a frank look , and said he “ thought it best . ”</l>
     <l n="220">Not long they 'd parted ere dispute arose ;</l>
     <l n="221">The game they hunted quickly made them foes .</l>
     <l n="222">Some house the father by his art had won</l>
     <l n="223">Seem 'd a fit cause of contest to the son ,</l>
     <l n="224">Who raised a claimant , and then found a way</l>
     <l n="225">By a staunch witness to secure his prey .</l>
     <l n="226">The people cursed him , but in times of need</l>
     <l n="227">Trusted in one so certain to succeed :</l>
     <l n="228">By Law 's dark by-ways he had stored his mind</l>
     <l n="229">With wicked knowledge , how to cheat mankind .</l>
     <l n="230">Few are the freeholds in our ancient town ;</l>
     <l n="231">A copyright from heir to heir came down ,</l>
     <l n="232">From whence some heat arose , when there was doubt</l>
     <l n="233">In point of heirship ; but the fire went out ,</l>
     <l n="234">Till our attorney had the art to raise</l>
     <l n="235">The dying spark , and blow it to a blaze :</l>
     <l n="236">For this he now began his friends to treat ;</l>
     <l n="237">His way to starve them was to make them eat ,</l>
     <l n="238">And drink oblivious draughts — to his applause ,</l>
     <l n="239">It must be said , he never starved a cause ;</l>
     <l n="240">He 'd roast and boil 'd upon his board ; the boast</l>
     <l n="241">Of half his victims was his boil 'd and roast ;</l>
     <l n="242">And these at every hour : — he seldom took</l>
     <l n="243">Aside his client , till he 'd praised his cook ;</l>
     <l n="244">Nor to an office led him , there in pain</l>
     <l n="245">To give his story and go out again ;</l>
     <l n="246">But first the brandy and the chine where seen ,</l>
     <l n="247">And then the business came by starts between .</l>
     <l n="248">“ Well , if ‘ tis so , the house to you belongs ;</l>
     <l n="249">But have you money to redress these wrongs ?</l>
     <l n="250">Nay , look not sad , my friend ; if you 're correct ,</l>
     <l n="251">You 'll find the friendship that you 'd not expect . ”</l>
     <l n="252">If right the man , the house was Swallow 's own ;</l>
     <l n="253">If wrong , his kindness and good-will were shown :</l>
     <l n="254">“ Rogue ! ” “ Villain ! ” “ Scoundrel ! ” cried the losers all :</l>
     <l n="255">He let them cry , for what would that recall ?</l>
     <l n="256">At length he left us , took a village seat ,</l>
     <l n="257">And like a vulture look 'd abroad for meat ;</l>
     <l n="258">The Borough-booty , give it all its praise ,</l>
     <l n="259">Had only served the appetite to raise ;</l>
     <l n="260">But if from simple heirs he drew their land ,</l>
     <l n="261">He might a noble feast at will command ;</l>
     <l n="262">Still he proceeded by his former rules ,</l>
     <l n="263">His bait their pleasures , when he fished for fools -</l>
     <l n="264">Flagons and haunches on his board were placed ,</l>
     <l n="265">And subtle avarice look 'd like thoughtless waste :</l>
     <l n="266">Most of his friends , though youth from him had fled ,</l>
     <l n="267">Were young , were minors , of their sires in dread ;</l>
     <l n="268">Or those whom widow 'd mothers kept in bounds ,</l>
     <l n="269">And check 'd their generous rage for steeds and hounds ;</l>
     <l n="270">Or such as travell 'd ‘ cross the land to view</l>
     <l n="271">A Christian 's conflict with a boxing Jew :</l>
     <l n="272">Some too had run upon Newmarket heath</l>
     <l n="273">With so much speed that they were out of breath ;</l>
     <l n="274">Others had tasted claret , till they now</l>
     <l n="275">To humbler port would turn , and knew not how .</l>
     <l n="276">All these for favours would to Swallow run ,</l>
     <l n="277">Who never sought their thanks for all he 'd done ;</l>
     <l n="278">He kindly took them by the hand , then bow 'd</l>
     <l n="279">Politely low , and thus his love avow 'd -</l>
     <l n="280">( For he 'd a way that many judged polite ,</l>
     <l n="281">A cunning dog — he 'd fawn before he 'd bite ) -</l>
     <l n="282">“ Observe , my friends , the frailty of our race</l>
     <l n="283">When age unmans us — let me state a case :</l>
     <l n="284">There 's our friend Rupert — we shall soon redress</l>
     <l n="285">His present evil — drink to our success -</l>
     <l n="286">I flatter not ; but did you ever see</l>
     <l n="287">Limbs better turn 'd ? a prettier boy than he ?</l>
     <l n="288">His senses all acute , his passions such</l>
     <l n="289">As Nature gave — she never does too much ;</l>
     <l n="290">His the bold wish the cup of joy to drain ,</l>
     <l n="291">And strength to bear it without qualm or pain .</l>
     <l n="292">“ Now view his father as he dozing lies ,</l>
     <l n="293">Whose senses wake not when he opes his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="294">Who slips and shuffles when he means to walk ,</l>
     <l n="295">And lisps and gabbles if he tries to talk ;</l>
     <l n="296">Feeling he 's none — he could as soon destroy</l>
     <l n="297">The earth itself , as aught it holds enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="298">A nurse attends him to lay straight his limbs ,</l>
     <l n="299">Present his gruel , and respect his whims :</l>
     <l n="300">Now shall this dotard from our hero hold</l>
     <l n="301">His lands and lordships ? Shall he hide his gold !</l>
     <l n="302">That which he cannot use , and dare not show ,</l>
     <l n="303">And will not give — why longer should he owe ?</l>
     <l n="304">Yet , t'would be murder should we snap the locks ,</l>
     <l n="305">And take the thing he worships from the box ;</l>
     <l n="306">So let him dote and dream : but , till he die ,</l>
     <l n="307">Shall not our generous heir receive supply ?</l>
     <l n="308">For ever sitting on the river 's brink ?</l>
     <l n="309">And ever thirsty , shall he fear to drink ?</l>
     <l n="310">The means are simple , let him only wish ,</l>
     <l n="311">Then say he 's willing , and I 'll fill his dish . ”</l>
     <l n="312">They all applauded , and not least the boy ,</l>
     <l n="313">Who now replied , “ It fill 'd his heart with joy</l>
     <l n="314">To find he needed not deliv'rance crave</l>
     <l n="315">Of death , or wish the Justice in the grave ;</l>
     <l n="316">Who , while he spent , would every art retain ,</l>
     <l n="317">Of luring home the scatter 'd gold again ;</l>
     <l n="318">Just as a fountain gaily spirts and plays</l>
     <l n="319">With what returns in still and secret ways . ”</l>
     <l n="320">Short was the dream of bliss ; he quickly found</l>
     <l n="321">His father 's acres all were Swallow 's ground .</l>
     <l n="322">Yet to those arts would other heroes lend</l>
     <l n="323">A willing ear , and Swallow was their friend ;</l>
     <l n="324">Ever successful , some began to think</l>
     <l n="325">That Satan help 'd him to his pen and ink ;</l>
     <l n="326">And shrewd suspicions ran about the place ,</l>
     <l n="327">“ There was a compact ” — I must leave the case .</l>
     <l n="328">But of the parties , had the fiend been one ,</l>
     <l n="329">The business could not have been speedier done :</l>
     <l n="330">Still when a man has angled day and night ,</l>
     <l n="331">The silliest gudgeons will refuse to bite :</l>
     <l n="332">So Swallow tried no more : but if they came</l>
     <l n="333">To seek his friendship , that remain 'd the same :</l>
     <l n="334">Thus he retired in peace , and some would say</l>
     <l n="335">He 'd balk 'd his partner , and had learn 'd to pray .</l>
     <l n="336">To this some zealots lent an ear , and sought</l>
     <l n="337">How Swallow felt , then said “ a change is wrought . ”</l>
     <l n="338">‘ Twas true there wanted all the signs of grace ,</l>
     <l n="339">But there were strong professions in their place ;</l>
     <l n="340">Then , too , the less that men from him expect ,</l>
     <l n="341">The more the praise to the converting sect ;</l>
     <l n="342">He had not yet subscribed to all their creed ,</l>
     <l n="343">Nor own 'd a Call , but he confess 'd the need :</l>
     <l n="344">His aquiescent speech , his gracious look ,</l>
     <l n="345">That pure attention , when the brethren spoke ,</l>
     <l n="346">Was all contrition ,— he had felt the wound ,</l>
     <l n="347">And with confession would again be sound .</l>
     <l n="348">True , Swallow 's board had still the sumptuous treat ;</l>
     <l n="349">But could they blame ? the warmest zealots eat :</l>
     <l n="350">He drank — ‘ twas needful his poor nerves to brace ;</l>
     <l n="351">He swore — ‘ twas habit ; he was grieved — ‘ twas grace :</l>
     <l n="352">What could they do a new-born zeal to nurse ?</l>
     <l n="353">“ His wealth 's undoubted — let him hold our purse ;</l>
     <l n="354">He 'll add his bounty , and the house we 'll raise</l>
     <l n="355">Hard by the church , and gather all her strays :</l>
     <l n="356">We 'll watch her sinners as they home retire ,</l>
     <l n="357">And pluck the brands from the devouring fire . ”</l>
     <l n="358">Alas ! such speech was but an empty boast ;</l>
     <l n="359">The good men reckon 'd , but without their host ;</l>
     <l n="360">Swallow , delighted , took the trusted store ,</l>
     <l n="361">And own 'd the sum ; they did not ask for more ,</l>
     <l n="362">Till more was needed ; when they call 'd for aid -</l>
     <l n="363">And had it ?— No , their agent was afraid :</l>
     <l n="364">“ Could he but know to whom he should refund</l>
     <l n="365">He would most gladly — nay , he 'd go beyond ;</l>
     <l n="366">But when such numbers claim 'd , when some were gone .</l>
     <l n="367">And others going — he must hold it on ;</l>
     <l n="368">The Lord would help them . ” — Loud their anger grew ,</l>
     <l n="369">And while they threat'ning from his door withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="370">He bow 'd politely low , and bade them all adieu ,</l>
     <l n="371">But lives the man by whom such deeds are done !</l>
     <l n="372">Yes , many such — But Swallow 's race is run ;</l>
     <l n="373">His name is lost ,— for though his sons have name ,</l>
     <l n="374">It is not his , they all escape the shame ;</l>
     <l n="375">Nor is there vestige now of all he had ,</l>
     <l n="376">His means are wasted , for his heir was mad :</l>
     <l n="377">Still we of Swallow as a monster speak ,</l>
     <l n="378">A hard bad man , who prey 'd upon the weak .</l>

     <l n="9">NEXT , to a graver tribe we turn our view ,</l>
     <l n="10">And yield the praise to worth and science due ,</l>
     <l n="11">But this with serious words and sober style ,</l>

     <l n="15">We own that numbers join with care and skill ,</l>
     <l n="16">A temperate judgment , a devoted will :</l>
     <l n="17">Men who suppress their feelings , but who feel</l>
     <l n="18">The painful symptoms they delight to heal ;</l>
     <l n="19">Patient in all their trials , they sustain</l>
     <l n="20">The starts of passion , the reproach of pain ;</l>
     <l n="21">With hearts affected , but with looks serene ,</l>
     <l n="22">Intent they wait through all the solemn scene ;</l>
     <l n="23">Glad if a hope should rise from nature 's strife ,</l>
     <l n="24">To aid their skill and save the lingering life ;</l>
     <l n="25">But this must virtue 's generous effort be ,</l>

     <l n="27">To the Physician of the Soul , and these ,</l>
     <l n="28">Turn the distress 'd for safety , hope , and ease .</l>
     <l n="29">But as physicians of that nobler kind</l>
     <l n="30">Have their warm zealots , and their sectaries blind ;</l>
     <l n="31">So among these for knowledge most renowned ,</l>
     <l n="32">Are dreamers strange , and stubborn bigots found :</l>
     <l n="33">Some , too , admitted to this honourd name ,</l>
     <l n="34">Have , without learning , found a way to fame ;</l>
     <l n="35">And some by learning — young physicians write ,</l>
     <l n="36">To set their merit in the fairest light ;</l>
     <l n="37">With them a treatise in a bait that draws</l>
     <l n="38">Approving voices — ‘ tis to gain applause ,</l>
     <l n="39">And to exalt them in the public view ,</l>
     <l n="40">More than a life of worthy toil could do .</l>
     <l n="41">When ‘ tis proposed to make the man renown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">In every age , convenient doubts abound ;</l>
     <l n="43">Convenient themes in every period start ,</l>
     <l n="44">Which he may treat with all the pomp of art ;</l>
     <l n="45">Curious conjectures he may always make ,</l>
     <l n="46">And either side of dubious questions take ;</l>
     <l n="47">He may a system broach , or , if he please ,</l>
     <l n="48">Start new opinions of an old disease :</l>
     <l n="49">Or may some simple in the woodland trace ,</l>
     <l n="50">And be its patron , till it runs its race ;</l>
     <l n="51">As rustic damsels from their woods are won ,</l>
     <l n="52">And live in splendour till their race be run ;</l>
     <l n="53">It weighs not much on what their powers be shown ,</l>
     <l n="54">When all his purpose is to make them known .</l>
     <l n="55">To show the world what long experience gains ,</l>
     <l n="56">Requires not courage , though it calls for pains ;</l>
     <l n="57">But at life 's outset to inform mankind</l>
     <l n="58">Is a bold effort of a valiant mind .</l>
     <l n="59">The great , good man , for noblest cause displays</l>
     <l n="60">What many labours taught , and many days ;</l>
     <l n="61">These sound instruction from experience give ,</l>
     <l n="62">The others show us how they mean to live .</l>
     <l n="63">That they have genius , and they hope mankind</l>
     <l n="64">Will to its efforts be no longer blind .</l>
     <l n="65">There are , beside , whom powerful friends advance ,</l>
     <l n="66">Whom fashion favours , person , patrons , chance :</l>
     <l n="67">And merit sighs to see a fortune made</l>
     <l n="68">By daring rashness or by dull parade .</l>
     <l n="69">But these are trifling evils ; there is one</l>
     <l n="70">Which walks uncheck 'd , and triumphs in the sun :</l>
     <l n="71">There was a time , when we beheld the Quack ,</l>
     <l n="72">On public stage , the licensed trade attack ;</l>
     <l n="73">He made his laboured speech with poor parade ,</l>
     <l n="74">And then a laughing zany lent him aid :</l>
     <l n="75">Smiling we pass 'd him , but we felt the while</l>
     <l n="76">Pity so much , that soon we ceased to smile ;</l>
     <l n="77">Assured that fluent speech and flow'ry vest</l>
     <l n="78">Disguised the troubles of a man distress 'd ; -</l>
     <l n="79">But now our Quacks are gamesters , and they play</l>
     <l n="80">With craft and skill to ruin and betray ;</l>
     <l n="81">With monstrous promise they delude the mind ,</l>
     <l n="82">And thrive on all that tortures human-kind .</l>
     <l n="83">Void of all honour , avaricious , rash ,</l>
     <l n="84">The daring tribe compound their boasted trash -</l>
     <l n="85">Tincture of syrup , lotion , drop , or pill ;</l>
     <l n="86">All tempt the sick to trust the lying bill ;</l>
     <l n="87">And twenty names of cobblers turn 'd to squires ,</l>
     <l n="88">Aid the bold language of these blushless liars .</l>
     <l n="89">There are among them those who cannot read ,</l>
     <l n="90">And yet they 'll buy a patent , and succeed ;</l>
     <l n="91">Will dare to promise dying sufferers aid ,</l>
     <l n="92">For who , when dead , can threaten or upbraid ?</l>
     <l n="93">With cruel avarice still they recommend</l>
     <l n="94">More draughts , more syrup , to the journey 's end :</l>
     <l n="95">“ I feel it not ; ” — “ Then take it every hour : ”</l>
     <l n="96">“ It makes me worse ; ” — “ Why then it shows its power ; ”</l>
     <l n="97">“ I fear to die ; ” — “ Let not your spirits sink ,</l>
     <l n="98">You 're always safe , while you believe and drink . ”</l>
     <l n="99">How strange to add , in this nefarious trade ,</l>
     <l n="100">That men of parts are dupes by dunces made :</l>
     <l n="101">That creatures , nature meant should clean our streets ,</l>
     <l n="102">Have purchased lands and mansions , parks and seats :</l>
     <l n="103">Wretches with conscience so obtuse , they leave</l>
     <l n="104">Their untaught sons their parents to deceive ;</l>
     <l n="105">And when they 're laid upon their dying bed ,</l>
     <l n="106">No thought of murder comes into their head ,</l>
     <l n="107">Nor one revengeful ghost to them appears ,</l>
     <l n="108">To fill the soul with penitential fears .</l>
     <l n="109">Yet not the whole of this imposing train</l>
     <l n="110">Their gardens , seats , and carriages obtain :</l>
     <l n="111">Chiefly , indeed , they to the robbers fall ,</l>
     <l n="112">Who are most fitted to disgrace them all ;</l>
     <l n="113">But there is hazard — patents must be bought ,</l>
     <l n="114">Venders and puffers for the poison sought ;</l>
     <l n="115">And then in many a paper through the year ,</l>
     <l n="116">Must cures and cases , oaths and proofs appear ;</l>
     <l n="117">Men snatch 'd from graves , as they were dropping in ,</l>
     <l n="118">Their lungs cough 'd up , their bones pierced through their skin</l>
     <l n="119">Their liver all one schirrus , and the frame</l>
     <l n="120">Poison 'd with evils which they dare not name ;</l>
     <l n="121">Men who spent all upon physicians ’ fees ,</l>
     <l n="122">Who never slept , nor had a moment 's ease ,</l>
     <l n="123">Are now as roaches sound , and all as brisk as bees ,</l>
     <l n="124">If the sick gudgeons to the bait attend ,</l>
     <l n="125">And come in shoals , the angler gains his end :</l>
     <l n="126">But should the advertising cash be spent ,</l>
     <l n="127">Ere yet the town has due attention lent ,</l>
     <l n="128">Then bursts the bubble , and the hungry cheat</l>
     <l n="129">Pines for the bread he ill deserves to eat ;</l>
     <l n="130">It is a lottery , and he shares perhaps</l>
     <l n="131">The rich man 's feast , or begs the pauper 's scraps .</l>
     <l n="132">From powerful causes spring th ’ empiric 's gains ,</l>
     <l n="133">Man 's love of life , his weakness , and his pains ;</l>
     <l n="134">These first induce him the vile trash to try ,</l>
     <l n="135">Then lend his name , that other men may buy :</l>
     <l n="136">This love of life , which in our nature rules ,</l>
     <l n="137">To vile imposture makes us dupes and tools ;</l>
     <l n="138">Then pain compels th ’ impatient soul to seize</l>
     <l n="139">On promised hopes of instantaneous ease ;</l>
     <l n="140">And weakness too with every wish complies ,</l>
     <l n="141">Worn out and won by importunities .</l>
     <l n="142">Troubled with something in your bile or blood ,</l>
     <l n="143">You think your doctor does you little good ;</l>
     <l n="144">And grown impatient , you require in haste</l>
     <l n="145">The nervous cordial , nor dislike the taste ;</l>
     <l n="146">It comforts , heals , and strengthens ; nay , you think</l>
     <l n="147">It makes you better every time you drink ;</l>
     <l n="148">“ Then lend your name “ you 're loth , but yet confess</l>
     <l n="149">Its powers are great , and so you acquiesce :</l>
     <l n="150">Yet think a moment , ere your name you lend ,</l>
     <l n="151">With whose ‘ tis placed , and what you recommend ;</l>
     <l n="152">Who tipples brandy will some comfort feel ,</l>
     <l n="153">But will he to the med'cine set his seal ?</l>
     <l n="154">Wait , and you 'll find the cordial you admire</l>
     <l n="155">Has added fuel to your fever 's fire :</l>
     <l n="156">Say , should a robber chance your purse to spare ,</l>
     <l n="157">Would you the honour of the man declare ?</l>
     <l n="158">Would you assist his purpose ? swell his crime ?</l>
     <l n="159">Besides , he might not spare a second time .</l>
     <l n="160">Compassion sometimes sets the fatal sign ,</l>
     <l n="161">The man was poor , and humbly begg 'd a line ;</l>
     <l n="162">Else how should noble names and titles back</l>
     <l n="163">The spreading praise of some advent'rous quack ?</l>
     <l n="164">But he the moment watches , and entreats</l>
     <l n="165">Your honour 's name ,— your honour joins the cheats ;</l>
     <l n="166">You judged the med'cine harmless , and you lent</l>
     <l n="167">What help you could , and with the best intent ;</l>
     <l n="168">But can it please you , thus to league with all</l>
     <l n="169">Whom he can beg or bribe to swell the scrawl ?</l>
     <l n="170">Would you these wrappers with your name adorn</l>
     <l n="171">Which hold the poison for the yet unborn ?</l>
     <l n="172">No class escapes them — from the poor man 's pay ,</l>
     <l n="173">The nostrum takes no trifling part away :</l>
     <l n="174">See ! those square patent bottles from the shop ,</l>
     <l n="175">Now decoration to the cupboard 's top ;</l>
     <l n="176">And there a favourite hoard you 'll find within ,</l>
     <l n="177">Companions meet ! the julep and the gin .</l>
     <l n="178">Time too with cash is wasted ; ‘ tis the fate</l>
     <l n="179">Of real helpers to be call 'd too late ;</l>
     <l n="180">This find the sick , when ( time and patience gone )</l>
     <l n="181">Death with a tenfold terror hurries on .</l>
     <l n="182">Suppose the case surpasses human skill ,</l>
     <l n="183">There comes a quack to flatter weakness still ;</l>
     <l n="184">What greater evil can a flatterer do ,</l>
     <l n="185">Than from himself to take the sufferer 's view ?</l>
     <l n="186">To turn from sacred thoughts his reasoning powers ,</l>
     <l n="187">And rob a sinner of his dying hours ?</l>
     <l n="188">Yet this they dare , and craving to the last ,</l>
     <l n="189">In hope 's strong bondage hold their victim fast :</l>
     <l n="190">For soul or body no concern have they ,</l>
     <l n="191">All their inquiry , “ Can the patient pay ?</l>
     <l n="192">“ And will he swallow draughts until his dying day ? ”</l>
     <l n="193">Observe what ills to nervous females flow ,</l>
     <l n="194">When the heart flutters , and the pulse is low ;</l>
     <l n="195">If once induced these cordial sips to try ,</l>
     <l n="196">All feel the ease , and few the danger fly ;</l>
     <l n="197">For , while obtain 'd , of drams they 've all the force ,</l>
     <l n="198">And when denied , then drams are the resource .</l>
     <l n="199">Nor these the only evils — there are those</l>
     <l n="200">Who for the troubled mind prepare repose ;</l>
     <l n="201">They write : the young are tenderly address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="202">Much danger hinted , much concern express 'd ;</l>
     <l n="203">They dwell on freedoms lads are prone to take ,</l>
     <l n="204">Which makes the doctor tremble for their sake ;</l>
     <l n="205">Still if the youthful patient will but trust</l>
     <l n="206">In one so kind , so pitiful , and just ;</l>
     <l n="207">If he will take the tonic all the time ,</l>
     <l n="208">And hold but moderate intercourse with crime ;</l>
     <l n="209">The sage will gravely give his honest word ,</l>
     <l n="210">That strength and spirits shall be both restored ;</l>
     <l n="211">In plainer English — if you mean to sin ,</l>
     <l n="212">Fly to the drops , and instantly begin .</l>
     <l n="213">Who would not lend a sympathizing sigh ,</l>
     <l n="214">To hear yon infant 's pity-moving cry ?</l>
     <l n="215">That feeble sob , unlike the new-born note</l>
     <l n="216">Which came with vigour from the op'ning throat ,</l>
     <l n="217">When air and light first rush 'd on lungs and eyes ,</l>
     <l n="218">And there was life and spirit in the cries ;</l>
     <l n="219">Now an abortive , faint attempt to weep</l>
     <l n="220">Is all we hear ; sensation is asleep :</l>
     <l n="221">The boy was healthy , and at first express 'd</l>
     <l n="222">His feelings loudly when he fail 'd to rest ;</l>
     <l n="223">When cramm 'd with food , and tighten 'd every limb ,</l>
     <l n="224">To cry aloud was what pertain 'd to him ;</l>
     <l n="225">Then the good nurse ( who , had she borne a brain ,</l>
     <l n="226">Had sought the cause that made her babe complain )</l>
     <l n="227">Has all her efforts , loving soul ! applied</l>
     <l n="228">To set the cry , and not the cause , aside ;</l>
     <l n="229">She gave her powerful sweet without remorse</l>
     <l n="230">The sleeping cordial — she had tried its force ,</l>
     <l n="231">Repeating oft : the infant , freed from pain ,</l>
     <l n="232">Rejected food , but took the dose again ,</l>
     <l n="233">Sinking to sleep ; while she her joy express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="234">That her dear charge could sweetly take his rest :</l>
     <l n="235">Soon may she spare her cordial ; not a doubt</l>
     <l n="236">Remains , but quickly he will resfc without .</l>
     <l n="237">This moves our grief and pity , and we sigh</l>
     <l n="238">To think what numbers from these causes die ;</l>
     <l n="239">But what contempt and anger should we show ,</l>
     <l n="240">Did we the lives of these impostors know !</l>
     <l n="241">Ere for the world 's I left the cares of school ,</l>
     <l n="242">One I remember who assumed the fool ;</l>
     <l n="243">A part well suited — when the idler boys</l>
     <l n="244">Would shout around him , and he loved the noise ;</l>
     <l n="245">They called him Neddy ;— Neddy had the art</l>
     <l n="246">To play with skill his ignominious part ;</l>
     <l n="247">When he his trifles would for sale display ,</l>
     <l n="248">And act the mimic for a schoolboy 's pay .</l>
     <l n="249">For many years he plied his humble trade ,</l>
     <l n="250">And used his tricks and talents to persuade ;</l>
     <l n="251">The fellow barely read , but chanced to look</l>
     <l n="252">Among the fragments of a tatter 'd book ;</l>
     <l n="253">Where , after many efforts made to spell</l>
     <l n="254">One puzzling word , he found it — oxymel ;</l>
     <l n="255">A potent thing , ‘ twas said to cure the ills</l>
     <l n="256">Of ailing lungs — the oxymel of squills :</l>
     <l n="257">Squills he procured , but found the bitter strong</l>
     <l n="258">And most unpleasant ; none would take it long ;</l>
     <l n="259">But the pure acid and the sweet would make</l>
     <l n="260">A med'cine numbers would for pleasure take .</l>
     <l n="261">There was a fellow near , an artful knave ,</l>
     <l n="262">Who knew the plan , and much assistance gave ;</l>
     <l n="263">He wrote the puffs , and every talent plied</l>
     <l n="264">To make it sell : it sold , and then he died .</l>
     <l n="265">Now all the profit fell to Ned 's control ,</l>
     <l n="266">And Pride and Avarice quarrell 'd for his soul ;</l>
     <l n="267">When mighty profits by the trash were made ,</l>
     <l n="268">Pride built a palace , Avarice groan 'd and paid ;</l>
     <l n="269">Pride placed the signs of grandeur all about ,</l>
     <l n="270">And Avarice barr 'd his friends and children out .</l>
     <l n="271">Now see him Doctor ! yes , the idle fool ,</l>
     <l n="272">The butt , the robber of the lads at school ;</l>
     <l n="273">Who then knew nothing , nothing since acquired ,</l>
     <l n="274">Became a doctor , honour 'd and admired ;</l>
     <l n="275">His dress , his frown , his dignity were such ,</l>
     <l n="276">Some who had known him thought his knowledge much ;</l>
     <l n="277">Nay , men of skill , of apprehension quick ,</l>
     <l n="278">Spite of their knowledge , trusted him when sick ;</l>
     <l n="279">Though he could neither reason , write , nor spell ,</l>
     <l n="280">They yet had hope his trash would make them well ;</l>
     <l n="281">And while they scorn 'd his parts , they took his oxymel .</l>
     <l n="282">Oh ! when his nerves had once received a shock ,</l>
     <l n="283">Sir Isaac Newton might have gone to Rock :</l>
     <l n="284">Hence impositions of the grossest kind ,</l>
     <l n="285">Hence thought is feeble , understanding blind ;</l>
     <l n="286">Hence sums enormous by those cheats are made ,</l>
     <l n="287">And deaths unnumber 'd by their dreadful trade .</l>
     <l n="288">Alas ! in vain is my contempt express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="289">To stronger passions are their words address 'd ;</l>
     <l n="290">To pain , to fear , to terror , their appeal ,</l>
     <l n="291">To those who , weakly reasoning , strongly feel .</l>
     <l n="292">What then our hopes ?— perhaps there may by law</l>
     <l n="293">Be method found these pests to curb and awe ;</l>
     <l n="294">Yet in this land of freedom law is slack</l>
     <l n="295">With any being to commence attack ;</l>
     <l n="296">Then let us trust to science — there are those</l>
     <l n="297">Who can their falsehoods and their frauds disclose ,</l>
     <l n="298">All their vile trash detect , and their low tricks expose ;</l>
     <l n="299">Perhaps their numbers may in time confound</l>
     <l n="300">Their arts — as scorpions give themselves the wound ;</l>
     <l n="301">For when these curers dwell in every place ,</l>
     <l n="302">While of the cured we not a man can trace ,</l>
     <l n="303">Strong truth may then the public mind persuade ,</l>
     <l n="304">And spoil the fruits of this nefarious trade .</l>

    <head>No extensive manufactories in the Borough ; yet considerable Fortunes made there — Ill Judgment of Parents in disposing of their Sons — The best educated not the most likely to succeed — Instance — Want of Success compensated by the lenient Power of some Avocations — The Naturalist — The Weaver an Entomologist , &amp; c .— A Prize Flower — Story of Walter and William .</head>
     <l n="1">OF manufactures , trade , inventions rare ,</l>
     <l n="2">Steam-towers and looms , you 'd know our Borough 's share -</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Tis small : we boast not these rich subjects here ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who hazard thrice ten thousand pounds a-year ;</l>
     <l n="5">We 've no huge buildings , where incessant noise</l>
     <l n="6">Is made by springs and spindles , girls and boys ;</l>
     <l n="7">Where , ‘ mid such thundering sounds , the maiden 's song</l>
     <l n="8">Is “ Harmony in Uproar ” all day long .</l>
     <l n="9">Still common minds with us in common trade ,</l>
     <l n="10">Have gain 'd more wealth than ever student made ;</l>
     <l n="11">And yet a merchant , when he gives his son</l>
     <l n="12">His college-learning , thinks his duty done ;</l>
     <l n="13">A way to wealth he leaves his boy to find ,</l>
     <l n="14">Just when he 's made for the discovery blind .</l>
     <l n="15">Jones and his wife perceived their elder boy</l>
     <l n="16">Took to his learning , and it gave them joy ;</l>
     <l n="17">This they encouraged , and were bless 'd to see</l>
     <l n="18">Their son a fellow with a high degree ;</l>
     <l n="19">A living fell , he married , and his sire</l>
     <l n="20">Declared ‘ twas all a father could require ;</l>
     <l n="21">Children then bless 'd them , and when letters came ,</l>
     <l n="22">The parents proudly told each grandchild 's name .</l>
     <l n="23">Meantime the sons at home in trade were placed ,</l>
     <l n="24">Money their object — just the father 's taste ;</l>
     <l n="25">Saving he lived and long , and when he died ,</l>
     <l n="26">He gave them all his fortune to divide :</l>
     <l n="27">“ Martin , ” said he , “ at vast expense was taught ;</l>
     <l n="28">He gain 'd his wish , and has the ease he sought . ”</l>
     <l n="29">Thus the good priest ( the Christian scholar ! ) finds</l>
     <l n="30">“ What estimate is made by vulgar minds ;</l>
     <l n="31">He sees his brothers , who had every gift</l>
     <l n="32">Of thriving , now assisted in their thrift ;</l>
     <l n="33">While he , whom learning , habits , all prevent ,</l>
     <l n="34">Is largely mulct for each impediment .</l>
     <l n="35">Yet let us own that Trade has much of chance ,</l>
     <l n="36">Not all the careful by their care advance ;</l>
     <l n="37">With the same parts and prospects , one a seat</l>
     <l n="38">Builds for himself ; one finds it in the Fleet .</l>
     <l n="39">Then to the wealthy you will see denied</l>
     <l n="40">Comforts and joys that with the poor abide :</l>
     <l n="41">There are who labour through the year , and yet</l>
     <l n="42">No more have gain 'd than — not to be in debt :</l>
     <l n="43">Who still maintain the same laborious course ,</l>
     <l n="44">Yet pleasure hails them from some favourite source ,</l>
     <l n="45">And health , amusements , children , wife , or friend ,</l>
     <l n="46">With life 's dull views their consolations blend .</l>
     <l n="47">Nor these alone possess the lenient power</l>
     <l n="48">Of soothing life in the desponding hour ;</l>
     <l n="49">Some favourite studies , some delightful care ,</l>
     <l n="50">The mind with trouble and distresses share ;</l>
     <l n="51">And by a coin , a flower , a verse , a boat ,</l>
     <l n="52">The stagnant spirits have been set afloat ;</l>
     <l n="53">They pleased at first , and then the habit grew ,</l>
     <l n="54">Till the fond heart no higher pleasure knew ;</l>
     <l n="55">Till , from all cares and other comforts freed ,</l>
     <l n="56">Th ’ important nothing took in life the lead .</l>
     <l n="57">With all his phlegm , it broke a Dutchman 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="58">At a vast price , with one loved root to part ;</l>
     <l n="59">And toys like these fill many a British mind ,</l>
     <l n="60">Although their hearts are found of firmer kind .</l>
     <l n="61">Oft have I smiled the happy pride to see</l>
     <l n="62">Of humble tradesmen , in their evening glee ;</l>
     <l n="63">When of some pleasing fancied good possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="64">Each grew alert , was busy , and was bless 'd :</l>
     <l n="65">Whether the call-bird yield the hour 's delight ,</l>
     <l n="66">Or , magnified in microscope the mite ;</l>
     <l n="67">Or whether tumblers , croppers , carriers seize</l>
     <l n="68">The gentle mind , they rule it and they please .</l>
     <l n="69">There is my friend the Weaver : strong desires</l>
     <l n="70">Reign in his breast ; ‘ tis beauty he admires :</l>
     <l n="71">See ! to the shady grove he wings his way ,</l>
     <l n="72">And feels in hope the raptures of the day -</l>
     <l n="73">Eager he looks : and soon , to glad his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="74">From the sweet bower , by nature form 'd , arise</l>
     <l n="75">Bright troops of virgin moths and fresh-born butterflies ;</l>
     <l n="76">Who broke that morning from their half-year 's sleep ,</l>
     <l n="77">To fly o'er flowers where they were wont to creep .</l>
     <l n="78">Above the sovereign oak , a sovereign skims ,</l>
     <l n="79">The purple Emp'ror , strong in wing and limbs :</l>
     <l n="80">There fair Camilla takes her flight serene ,</l>
     <l n="81">Adonis blue , and Paphia silver-queen ;</l>
     <l n="82">With every filmy fly from mead or bower ,</l>
     <l n="83">And hungry Sphinx who threads the honey 'd flower ;</l>
     <l n="84">She o'er the Larkspur 's bed , where sweets abound .</l>
     <l n="85">Views ev'ry bell , and hums th ’ approving sound ;</l>
     <l n="86">Poised on her busy plumes , with feeling nice</l>
     <l n="87">She draws from every flower , nor tries a floret twice .</l>
     <l n="88">He fears no bailiff 's wrath , no baron 's blame ,</l>
     <l n="89">His is untax 'd and undisputed game :</l>
     <l n="90">Nor less the place of curious plant he knows ;</l>
     <l n="91">He both his Flora and his Fauna shows ;</l>
     <l n="92">For him is blooming in its rich array</l>
     <l n="93">The glorious flower which bore the palm away ;</l>
     <l n="94">In vain a rival tried his utmost art ,</l>
     <l n="95">His was the prize , and joy o'erflow ' d his heart .</l>
     <l n="96">“ This , this ! is beauty ; cast , I pray , your eyes</l>
     <l n="97">On this my glory ! see the grace ! the size !</l>
     <l n="98">Was ever stem so tall , so stout , so strong ,</l>
     <l n="99">Exact in breadth , in just proportion long ?</l>
     <l n="100">These brilliant hues are all distinct and clean ,</l>
     <l n="101">No kindred tint , no blending streaks between :</l>
     <l n="102">This is no shaded , run-off , pin-eyed thing ;</l>
     <l n="103">A king of flowers , a flower for England 's king :</l>
     <l n="104">I own my pride , and thank the favouring star</l>
     <l n="105">Which shed such beauty on my fair Bizarre . ”</l>
     <l n="106">Thus may the poor the cheap indulgence seize ,</l>
     <l n="107">While the most wealthy pine and pray for ease ;</l>
     <l n="108">Content not always waits upon success ,</l>
     <l n="109">And more may he enjoy who profits less .</l>
     <l n="110">Walter and William took ( their father dead )</l>
     <l n="111">Jointly the trade to which they both were bred ;</l>
     <l n="112">When fix 'd , they married , and they quickly found</l>
     <l n="113">With due success their honest labours crown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="114">Few were their losses , but although a few ,</l>
     <l n="115">Walter was vex 'd and somewhat peevish grew :</l>
     <l n="116">“ You put your trust in every pleading fool , ”</l>
     <l n="117">Said he to William , and grew strange and cool .</l>
     <l n="118">“ Brother forbear , ” he answer 'd ; “ take your due ,</l>
     <l n="119">Nor let my lack of caution injure you : ”</l>
     <l n="120">Half friends they parted ,— better so to close ,</l>
     <l n="121">Than longer wait to part entirely foes .</l>
     <l n="122">Walter had knowledge , prudence , jealous care ;</l>
     <l n="123">He let no idle views his bosom share ;</l>
     <l n="124">He never thought nor felt for other men -</l>
     <l n="125">“ Let one mind one , and all are minded then . ”</l>
     <l n="126">Friends he respected , and believed them just ,</l>
     <l n="127">But they were men , and he would no man trust ;</l>
     <l n="128">He tried and watch 'd his people day and night , -</l>
     <l n="129">The good it harm 'd not ; for the bad ‘ twas right :</l>
     <l n="130">He could their humours bear , nay disrespect ,</l>
     <l n="131">But he could yield no pardon to neglect ;</l>
     <l n="132">That all about him were of him afraid</l>
     <l n="133">“ Was right , ” he said — “ so should we be obey 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="134">These merchant-maxims , much good fortune too ,</l>
     <l n="135">And ever keeping one grand point in view ,</l>
     <l n="136">To vast amount his once small portion drew .</l>
     <l n="137">William was kind and easy ; he complied</l>
     <l n="138">With all requests , or grieved when he denied ;</l>
     <l n="139">To please his wife he made a costly trip ,</l>
     <l n="140">To please his child he let a bargain slip ;</l>
     <l n="141">Prone to compassion , mild with the distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="142">He bore with all who poverty profess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="143">And some would he assist , nor one would he arrest .</l>
     <l n="144">He had some loss at sea , bad debts at land ,</l>
     <l n="145">His clerk absconded with some bills in hand ,</l>
     <l n="146">And plans so often fail 'd , that he no longer plann 'd .</l>
     <l n="147">To a small house ( his brother 's ) he withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="148">At easy rent — the man was not a Jew ;</l>
     <l n="149">And there his losses and his cares he bore ,</l>
     <l n="150">Nor found that want of wealth could make him poor .</l>
     <l n="151">No , he in fact was rich ! nor could he move ,</l>
     <l n="152">But he was follow 'd by the looks of love ;</l>
     <l n="153">All he had suffer 'd , every former grief ,</l>
     <l n="154">Made those around more studious in relief ;</l>
     <l n="155">He saw a cheerful smile in every face ,</l>
     <l n="156">And lost all thoughts of error and disgrace .</l>
     <l n="157">Pleasant it was to see them in their walk</l>
     <l n="158">Round their small garden , and to hear them talk ;</l>
     <l n="159">Free are their children , but their love refrains</l>
     <l n="160">From all offence — none murmurs , none complains ;</l>
     <l n="161">Whether a book amused them , speech or play ,</l>
     <l n="162">Their looks were lively , and their hearts were gay ;</l>
     <l n="163">There no forced efforts for delight were made ,</l>
     <l n="164">Joy came with prudence , and without parade ;</l>
     <l n="165">Their common comforts they had all in view ,</l>
     <l n="166">Light were their troubles , and their wishes few :</l>
     <l n="167">Thrift made them easy for the coming day ,</l>
     <l n="168">Religion took the dread of death away ;</l>
     <l n="169">A cheerful spirit still ensured content ,</l>
     <l n="170">And love smiled round them wheresoe'er they went .</l>
     <l n="171">Walter , meantime , with all his wealth 's increase ,</l>
     <l n="172">Gain 'd many points , but could not purchase peace ;</l>
     <l n="173">When he withdrew from business for an hour ,</l>
     <l n="174">Some fled his presence , all confess 'd his power ;</l>
     <l n="175">He sought affection , but received instead</l>
     <l n="176">Fear undisguised , and love-repelling dread ;</l>
     <l n="177">He look 'd around him — “ Harriet , dost thou love ? ”</l>
     <l n="178">“ I do my duty , ” said the timid dove ;</l>
     <l n="179">“ Good Heav'n , your duty ! prithee , tell me now -</l>
     <l n="180">To love and honour — was not that your vow ?</l>
     <l n="181">Come , my good Harriet , I would gladly seek</l>
     <l n="182">Your inmost thought — Why can n't the woman speak ?</l>
     <l n="183">Have you not all things ? ” — “ Sir , do I complain ? ” -</l>
     <l n="184">“ No , that 's my part , which I perform in vain ;</l>
     <l n="185">I want a simple answer , and direct -</l>
     <l n="186">But you evade ; yes ! ‘ tis as I suspect .</l>
     <l n="187">Come then , my children ! Watt ! upon your knees</l>
     <l n="188">Vow that you love me . ” — “ Yes , sir , if you please . ”</l>
     <l n="189">“ Again ! By Heav'n , it mads me ; I require</l>
     <l n="190">Love , and they 'll do whatever I desire :</l>
     <l n="191">Thus too my people shun me ; I would spend</l>
     <l n="192">A thousand pounds to get a single friend ;</l>
     <l n="193">I would be happy — I have means to pay</l>
     <l n="194">For love and friendship , and you run away :</l>
     <l n="195">Ungrateful creatures ! why , you seem to dread</l>
     <l n="196">My very looks ; I know you wish me dead .</l>
     <l n="197">Come hither , Nancy ! you must hold me dear ;</l>
     <l n="198">Hither , I say ; why ! what have you to fear ?</l>
     <l n="199">You see I 'm gentle — Come , you trifler , come :</l>
     <l n="200">My God ! she trembles !— Idiot , leave the room !</l>
     <l n="201">Madam ; your children hate me ; I suppose</l>
     <l n="202">They know their cue ; you make them all my foes :</l>
     <l n="203">I 've not a friend in all the world — not one :</l>
     <l n="204">I 'd be a bankrupt sooner ; nay , ‘ tis done ;</l>
     <l n="205">In every better hope of life I fail ,</l>
     <l n="206">You 're all tormentors , and my house a jail .</l>
     <l n="207">Out of my sight ! I 'll sit and make my will -</l>
     <l n="208">What , glad to go ? stay , devils , and be still ;</l>
     <l n="209">‘ Tis to your Uncle 's cot you wish to run ,</l>
     <l n="210">To learn to live at ease and be undone ;</l>
     <l n="211">Him you can love , who lost his whole estate ,</l>
     <l n="212">And I , who gain you fortunes , have your hate ;</l>
     <l n="213">‘ Tis in my absence you yourselves enjoy :</l>
     <l n="214">Tom ! are you glad to lose me ? tell me , boy :</l>
     <l n="215">Yes ! does he answer ?— Yes ! upon my soul ;</l>
     <l n="216">No awe , no fear , no duty , no control !</l>
     <l n="217">Away ! away ! ten thousand devils seize</l>
     <l n="218">All I possess , and plunder where they please !</l>
     <l n="219">What 's wealth to me ?— yes , yes ! it gives me sway ,</l>
     <l n="220">And you shall feel it — Go ! begone , I say . ” { 4 }</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">OF our Amusements ask you ?— We amuse</l>
     <l n="9">Ourselves and friends with seaside walks and views ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or take a morning ride , a novel , or the news ;</l>
     <l n="11">Or , seeking nothing , glide about the street ,</l>
     <l n="12">And so engaged , with various parties meet ;</l>
     <l n="13">Awhile we stop , discourse of wind and tide</l>
     <l n="14">Bathing and books , the raffle , and the ride ;</l>
     <l n="15">Thus , with the aid which shops and sailing give ,</l>
     <l n="16">Life passes on ; ‘ tis labour , but we live .</l>
     <l n="17">When evening comes , our invalids awake ,</l>
     <l n="18">Nerves cease to tremble , heads forbear to ache ;</l>
     <l n="19">Then cheerful meals the sunken spirits raise ,</l>
     <l n="20">Cards or the dance , wine , visiting , or plays .</l>
     <l n="21">Soon as the season comes , and crowds arrive ,</l>
     <l n="22">To their superior rooms the wealthy drive ;</l>
     <l n="23">Others look round for lodging snug and small ,</l>
     <l n="24">Such is their taste — they 've hatred to a hall :</l>
     <l n="25">Hence one his fav'rite habitation gets ,</l>
     <l n="26">The brick-floor 'd parlour which the butcher lets ;</l>
     <l n="27">Where , through his single light , he may regard</l>
     <l n="28">The various business of a common yard ,</l>
     <l n="29">Bounded by backs of buildings form 'd of clay ,</l>
     <l n="30">By stable , sties , and coops , et caetera .</l>
     <l n="31">The needy-vain , themselves awhile to shun ,</l>
     <l n="32">For dissipation to these dog-holes run ;</l>
     <l n="33">Where each ( assuming petty pomp ) appears ,</l>
     <l n="34">And quite forgets the shopboard and the shears .</l>
     <l n="35">For them are cheap amusements : they may slip</l>
     <l n="36">Beyond the town and take a private dip ;</l>
     <l n="37">When they may urge that , to be safe they mean ,</l>
     <l n="38">They 've heard there 's danger in a light machine ;</l>
     <l n="39">They too can gratis move the quays about ,</l>
     <l n="40">And gather kind replies to every doubt ;</l>
     <l n="41">There they a pacing , lounging tribe may view ,</l>
     <l n="42">The stranger 's guides , who 've little else to do ;</l>
     <l n="43">The Borough 's placemen , where no more they gain</l>
     <l n="44">Than keeps them idle , civil , poor , and vain .</l>
     <l n="45">Then may the poorest with the wealthy look</l>
     <l n="46">On ocean , glorious page of Nature 's book !</l>
     <l n="47">May see its varying views in every hour ,</l>
     <l n="48">All softness now , then rising with all power ,</l>
     <l n="49">As sleeping to invite , or threat'ning to devour :</l>
     <l n="50">‘ Tis this which gives us all our choicest views ;</l>
     <l n="51">Its waters heal us , and its shores amuse .</l>
     <l n="52">See ! those fair nymphs upon that rising strand ,</l>
     <l n="53">Yon long salt lake has parted from the land ;</l>
     <l n="54">Well pleased to press that path , so clean , so pure ,</l>
     <l n="55">To seem in danger , yet to feel secure ;</l>
     <l n="56">Trifling with terror , while they strive to shun</l>
     <l n="57">The curling billows ; laughing as they run ;</l>
     <l n="58">They know the neck that joins the shore and sea ,</l>
     <l n="59">Or , ah ! how changed that fearless laugh would be .</l>
     <l n="60">Observe how various Parties take their way ,</l>
     <l n="61">By seaside walks , or make the sand-hills gay ;</l>
     <l n="62">There group 'd are laughing maids and sighing swains ,</l>
     <l n="63">And some apart who feel unpitied pains ;</l>
     <l n="64">Pains from diseases , pains which those who feel ,</l>
     <l n="65">To the physician , not the fair , reveal :</l>
     <l n="66">For nymphs ( propitious to the lover 's sigh )</l>
     <l n="67">Leave these poor patients to complain and die .</l>
     <l n="68">Lo ! where on that huge anchor sadly leans</l>
     <l n="69">That sick tall figure , lost in other scenes ;</l>
     <l n="70">He late from India 's clime impatient sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="71">There , as his fortune grew , his spirits fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="72">For each delight , in search of wealth he went ,</l>
     <l n="73">For ease alone , the wealth acquired is spent -</l>
     <l n="74">And spent in vain ; enrich 'd , aggrieved , he sees</l>
     <l n="75">The envied poor possess 'd of joy and ease :</l>
     <l n="76">And now he flies from place to place , to gain</l>
     <l n="77">Strength for enjoyment , and still flies in vain :</l>
     <l n="78">Mark ! with what sadness , of that pleasant crew ,</l>
     <l n="79">Boist'rous in mirth , he takes a transient view ;</l>
     <l n="80">And fixing then his eye upon the sea ,</l>
     <l n="81">Thinks what has been and what must shortly be :</l>
     <l n="82">Is it not strange that man should health destroy ,</l>
     <l n="83">For joys that come when he is dead to joy ?</l>
     <l n="84">Now is it pleasant in the Summer-eve ,</l>
     <l n="85">When a broad shore retiring waters leave ,</l>
     <l n="86">Awhile to wait upon the firm fair sand ,</l>
     <l n="87">When all is calm at sea , all still at land ;</l>
     <l n="88">And there the ocean 's produce to explore ,</l>
     <l n="89">As floating by , or rolling on the shore :</l>
     <l n="90">Those living jellies which the flesh inflame ,</l>
     <l n="91">Fierce as a nettle , and from that its name ;</l>
     <l n="92">Some in huge masses , some that you may bring</l>
     <l n="93">In the small compass of a lady 's ring ;</l>
     <l n="94">Figured by hand divine — there 's not a gem</l>
     <l n="95">Wrought by man 's art to be compared to them ;</l>
     <l n="96">Soft , brilliant , tender , through the wave they glow ,</l>
     <l n="97">And make the moonbeam brighter where they flow .</l>
     <l n="98">Involved in sea-wrack , here you find a race</l>
     <l n="99">Which science , doubting , knows not where to place ;</l>
     <l n="100">On shell or stone is dropp 'd the embryo-seed ,</l>
     <l n="101">And quickly vegetates a vital breed .</l>
     <l n="102">While thus with pleasing wonder you inspect</l>
     <l n="103">Treasures the vulgar in their scorn reject ,</l>
     <l n="104">See as they float along th ’ entangled weeds</l>
     <l n="105">Slowly approach , upborne on bladdery beads ;</l>
     <l n="106">Wait till they land , and you shall then behold</l>
     <l n="107">The fiery sparks those tangled fronds infold ,</l>
     <l n="108">Myriads of living points ; th ’ unaided eye</l>
     <l n="109">Can but the fire and not the form descry .</l>
     <l n="110">And now your view upon the ocean turn ,</l>
     <l n="111">And there the splendour of the waves discern ;</l>
     <l n="112">Cast but a stone , or strike them with an oar ,</l>
     <l n="113">And you shall flames within the deep explore ;</l>
     <l n="114">Or scoop the stream phosphoric as you stand ,</l>
     <l n="115">And the cold flames shall flash along your hand ;</l>
     <l n="116">When , lost in wonder , you shall walk and gaze</l>
     <l n="117">On weeds that sparkle , and on waves that blaze .</l>
     <l n="118">The ocean too has Winter views serene ,</l>
     <l n="119">When all you see through densest fog is seen ;</l>
     <l n="120">When you can hear the fishers near at hand</l>
     <l n="121">Distinctly speak , yet see not where they stand ;</l>
     <l n="122">Or sometimes them and not their boat discern ;</l>
     <l n="123">Or half-conceal 'd some figure at the stern ;</l>
     <l n="124">The view 's all bounded , and from side to side</l>
     <l n="125">Your utmost prospect but a few ells wide ;</l>
     <l n="126">Boys who , on shore , to sea the pebble cast ,</l>
     <l n="127">Will hear it strike against the viewless mast ;</l>
     <l n="128">While the stern boatman growls his fierce disdain ,</l>
     <l n="129">At whom he knows not , whom he threats in vain .</l>
     <l n="130">Tis pleasant then to view the nets float past ,</l>
     <l n="131">Net after net till you have seen the last :</l>
     <l n="132">And as you wait till all beyond you slip ,</l>
     <l n="133">A boat comes gliding from an anchor 'd ship ,</l>
     <l n="134">Breaking the silence with the dipping oar ,</l>
     <l n="135">And their own tones , as labouring for the shore ;</l>
     <l n="136">Those measured tones which with the scene agree ,</l>
     <l n="137">And give a sadness to serenity .</l>
     <l n="138">All scenes like these the tender Maid should shun ,</l>
     <l n="139">Nor to a misty beach in autumn run ;</l>
     <l n="140">Much should she guard against the evening cold ,</l>
     <l n="141">And her slight shape with fleecy warmth infold ;</l>
     <l n="142">This she admits , but not with so much ease</l>
     <l n="143">Gives up the night-walk when th ’ attendants please :</l>
     <l n="144">Her have I seen , pale , vapour 'd through the day ,</l>
     <l n="145">With crowded parties at the midnight play ;</l>
     <l n="146">Faint in the morn , no powers could she exert ;</l>
     <l n="147">At night with Pam delighted and alert ;</l>
     <l n="148">In a small shop she 's raffled with a crowd ,</l>
     <l n="149">Breath 'd the thick air , and cough 'd and laugh 'd aloud ;</l>
     <l n="150">She who will tremble if her eye explore</l>
     <l n="151">“ The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor ; ”</l>
     <l n="152">Whom the kind doctor charged , with shaking head ,</l>
     <l n="153">At early hour to quit the beaux for bed ;</l>
     <l n="154">She has , contemning fear , gone down the dance ,</l>
     <l n="155">Till she perceived the rosy morn advance ;</l>
     <l n="156">Then has she wonder 'd , fainting o'er her tea ,</l>
     <l n="157">Her drops and julep should so useless be :</l>
     <l n="158">Ah ! sure her joys must ravish every sense ,</l>
     <l n="159">Who buys a portion at such vast expense .</l>
     <l n="160">Among those joys , ‘ tis one at eve to sail</l>
     <l n="161">On the broad River with a favourite gale ;</l>
     <l n="162">When no rough waves upon the bosom ride ,</l>
     <l n="163">But the keel cuts , nor rises on the tide ;</l>
     <l n="164">Safe from the stream the nearer gunwale stands ,</l>
     <l n="165">Where playful children trail their idle hands :</l>
     <l n="166">Or strive to catch long grassy leaves that float</l>
     <l n="167">On either side of the impeded boat ;</l>
     <l n="168">What time the moon arising shows the mud ,</l>
     <l n="169">A shining border to the silver flood :</l>
     <l n="170">When , by her dubious light , the meanest views ,</l>
     <l n="171">Chalk , stones , and stakes , obtain the richest hues ;</l>
     <l n="172">And when the cattle , as they gazing stand ,</l>
     <l n="173">Seem nobler objects than when view 'd from land :</l>
     <l n="174">Then anchor 'd vessels in the way appear ,</l>
     <l n="175">And sea-boys greet them as they pass — “ What cheer ? ”</l>
     <l n="176">The sleeping shell-ducks at the sound arise ,</l>
     <l n="177">And utter loud their unharmonious cries ;</l>
     <l n="178">Fluttering they move their weedy beds among ,</l>
     <l n="179">Or instant diving , hide their plumeless young .</l>
     <l n="180">Along the wall , returning from the town ,</l>
     <l n="181">The weary rustic homeward wanders down :</l>
     <l n="182">Who stops and gazes at such joyous crew ,</l>
     <l n="183">And feels his envy rising at the view ;</l>
     <l n="184">He the light speech and laugh indignant hears ,</l>
     <l n="185">And feels more press 'd by want , more vex 'd by fears .</l>
     <l n="186">Ah ! go in peace , good fellow , to thine home ,</l>
     <l n="187">Nor fancy these escape the general doom :</l>
     <l n="188">Gay as they seem , be sure with them are hearts</l>
     <l n="189">With sorrow tried ; there 's sadness in their parts :</l>
     <l n="190">If thou couldst see them when they think alone ,</l>
     <l n="191">Mirth , music , friends , and these amusements gone ;</l>
     <l n="192">Couldst thou discover every secret ill</l>
     <l n="193">That pains their spirit , or resists their will ;</l>
     <l n="194">Couldst thou behold forsaken Love 's distress ,</l>
     <l n="195">Or Envy 's pang at glory and success ,</l>
     <l n="196">Or Beauty , conscious of the spoils of Time ,</l>
     <l n="197">Or Guilt alarm 'd when Memory shows the crime ;</l>
     <l n="198">All that gives sorrow , terror , grief , and gloom ;</l>
     <l n="199">Content would cheer thee trudging to thine home .</l>
     <l n="200">There are , ‘ tis true , who lay their cares aside ,</l>
     <l n="201">And bid some hours in calm enjoyment glide ;</l>
     <l n="202">Perchance some fair one to the sober night</l>
     <l n="203">Adds ( by the sweetness of her song ) delight ;</l>
     <l n="204">And as the music on the water floats ,</l>
     <l n="205">Some bolder shore returns the soften 'd notes ;</l>
     <l n="206">Then , youth , beware , for all around conspire</l>
     <l n="207">To banish caution and to wake desire ;</l>
     <l n="208">The day 's amusement , feasting , beauty , wine ,</l>
     <l n="209">These accents sweet and this soft hour combine ,</l>
     <l n="210">When most unguarded , then to win that heart of thine :</l>
     <l n="211">But see , they land ! the fond enchantment flies ,</l>
     <l n="212">And in its place life 's common views arise .</l>
     <l n="213">Sometimes a Party , row 'd from town will land</l>
     <l n="214">On a small islet form 'd of shelly sand ,</l>
     <l n="215">Left by the water when the tides are low ,</l>
     <l n="216">But which the floods in their return o'erflow :</l>
     <l n="217">There will they anchor , pleased awhile to view</l>
     <l n="218">The watery waste , a prospect wild and new ;</l>
     <l n="219">The now receding billows give them space ,</l>
     <l n="220">On either side the growing shores to pace ;</l>
     <l n="221">And then returning , they contract the scene ,</l>
     <l n="222">Till small and smaller grows the walk between ;</l>
     <l n="223">As sea to sea approaches , shore to shores ,</l>
     <l n="224">Till the next ebb the sandy isle restores .</l>
     <l n="225">Then what alarm ! what danger and dismay ,</l>
     <l n="226">If all their trust , their boat , should drift away ;</l>
     <l n="227">And once it happen 'd — Gay the friends advanced ,</l>
     <l n="228">They walk 'd , they ran , they play 'd , they sang , they danced ;</l>
     <l n="229">The urns were boiling , and the cups went round ,</l>
     <l n="230">And not a grave or thoughtful face was found ;</l>
     <l n="231">On the bright sand they trod with nimble feet ,</l>
     <l n="232">Dry shelly sand that made the summer-seat ;</l>
     <l n="233">The wondering mews flew fluttering o'er the head ,</l>
     <l n="234">And waves ran softly up their shining bed .</l>
     <l n="235">Some form 'd a party from the rest to stray ,</l>
     <l n="236">Pleased to collect the trifles in their way ;</l>
     <l n="237">These to behold they call their friends around ,</l>
     <l n="238">No friends can hear , or hear another sound ;</l>
     <l n="239">Alarm 'd , they hasten , yet perceive not why ,</l>
     <l n="240">But catch the fear that quickens as they fly .</l>
     <l n="241">For lo ! a lady sage , who paced the sand</l>
     <l n="242">With her fair children , one in either hand ,</l>
     <l n="243">Intent on home , had turn 'd , and saw the boat</l>
     <l n="244">Slipp 'd from her moorings , and now far afloat ;</l>
     <l n="245">She gazed , she trembled , and though faint her call ,</l>
     <l n="246">It seem 'd , like thunder , to confound them all .</l>
     <l n="247">Their sailor-guides , the boatman and his mate ,</l>
     <l n="248">Had drank , and slept regardless of their state :</l>
     <l n="249">“ Awake ! ” they cried aloud ; “ Alarm the shore !</l>
     <l n="250">Shout all , or never shall we reach it more ! ”</l>
     <l n="251">Alas ! no shout the distant land can reach ,</l>
     <l n="252">Nor eye behold them from the foggy beach :</l>
     <l n="253">Again they join in one loud powerful cry ,</l>
     <l n="254">Then cease , and eager listen for reply ;</l>
     <l n="255">None came — the rising wind blew sadly by :</l>
     <l n="256">They shout once more , and then they turn aside ,</l>
     <l n="257">To see how quickly flow 'd the coming tide ;</l>
     <l n="258">Between each cry they find the waters steal</l>
     <l n="259">On their strange prison , and new horrors feel ;</l>
     <l n="260">Foot after foot on the contracted ground</l>
     <l n="261">The billows fall , and dreadful is the sound ;</l>
     <l n="262">Less and yet less the sinking isle became ,</l>
     <l n="263">And there was wailing , weeping , wrath , and blame .</l>
     <l n="264">Had one been there , with spirit strong and high ,</l>
     <l n="265">Who could observe , as he prepared to die ,</l>
     <l n="266">He might have seen of hearts the varying kind ,</l>
     <l n="267">And traced the movement of each different mind :</l>
     <l n="268">He might have seen , that not the gentle maid</l>
     <l n="269">Was more than stern and haughty man afraid ;</l>
     <l n="270">Such , calmly grieving , will their fears suppress ,</l>
     <l n="271">And silent prayers to Mercy 's throne address ;</l>
     <l n="272">While fiercer minds , impatient , angry , loud ,</l>
     <l n="273">Force their vain grief on the reluctant crowd :</l>
     <l n="274">The party 's patron , sorely sighing , cried ,</l>
     <l n="275">“ Why would you urge me ? I at first denied . ”</l>
     <l n="276">Fiercely they answer 'd , “ Why will you complain ,</l>
     <l n="277">Who saw no danger , or was warn 'd in vain ? ”</l>
     <l n="278">A few essay 'd the troubled soul to calm ,</l>
     <l n="279">But dread prevail 'd , and anguish and alarm .</l>
     <l n="280">Now rose the water through the lessening sand ,</l>
     <l n="281">And they seem 'd sinking while they yet could stand .</l>
     <l n="282">The sun went down , they look 'd from side to side ,</l>
     <l n="283">Nor aught except the gathering sea descried ;</l>
     <l n="284">Dark and more dark , more wet , more cold it grew ,</l>
     <l n="285">And the most lively bade to hope adieu :</l>
     <l n="286">Children by love then lifted from the seas ,</l>
     <l n="287">Felt not the waters at the parent 's knees ,</l>
     <l n="288">But wept aloud ; the wind increased the sound ,</l>
     <l n="289">And the cold billows as they broke around .</l>
     <l n="290">“ Once more , yet once again , with all our strength ,</l>
     <l n="291">Cry to the land — we may be heard at length . ”</l>
     <l n="292">Vain hope if yet unseen ! but hark ! an oar ,</l>
     <l n="293">That sound of bliss ! comes dashing to their shore ;</l>
     <l n="294">Still , still the water rises ; “ Haste ! ” they cry ,</l>
     <l n="295">“ Oh ! hurry , seamen ; in delay we die ; ”</l>
     <l n="296">( Seamen were these , who in their ship perceived</l>
     <l n="297">The drifted boat , and thus her crew relieved . )</l>
     <l n="298">And now the keel just cuts the cover 'd sand ,</l>
     <l n="299">Now to the gunwale stretches every hand :</l>
     <l n="300">With trembling pleasure all confused embark ,</l>
     <l n="301">And kiss the tackling of their welcome ark ;</l>
     <l n="302">While the most giddy , as they reach the shore ,</l>
     <l n="303">Think of their danger , and their GOD adore .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">YOU say you envy in your calm retreat</l>
     <l n="15">Our social Meetings ;— ‘ tis with joy we meet .</l>
     <l n="16">In these our parties you are pleased to find</l>
     <l n="17">Good sense and wit , with intercourse of mind ;</l>
     <l n="18">Composed of men who read , reflect , and write ,</l>
     <l n="19">Who , when they meet , must yield and share delight .</l>
     <l n="20">To you our Book-club has peculiar charm ,</l>
     <l n="21">For which you sicken in your quiet farm ;</l>
     <l n="22">Here you suppose us at our leisure placed ,</l>
     <l n="23">Enjoying freedom , and displaying taste :</l>
     <l n="24">With wisdom cheerful , temperately gay ,</l>
     <l n="25">Pleased to enjoy , and willing to display .</l>
     <l n="26">If thus your envy gives your ease its gloom ,</l>
     <l n="27">Give wings to fancy , and among us come .</l>
     <l n="28">We 're now assembled ; you may soon attend -</l>
     <l n="29">I 'll introduce you — “ Gentlemen , my friend . ”</l>
     <l n="30">“ Now are you happy ? you have pass 'd a night</l>
     <l n="31">In gay discourse , and rational delight . ”</l>
     <l n="32">“ Alas ! not so : for how can mortals think ,</l>
     <l n="33">Or thoughts exchange , if thus they eat and drink ?</l>
     <l n="34">No ! I confess when we had fairly dined ,</l>
     <l n="35">That was no time for intercourse of mind ;</l>
     <l n="36">There was each dish prepared with skill t'invite ,</l>
     <l n="37">And to detain the struggling appetite ;</l>
     <l n="38">On such occasions minds with one consent</l>
     <l n="39">Are to the comforts of the body lent ;</l>
     <l n="40">There was no pause — the wine went quickly round ,</l>
     <l n="41">Till struggling Fancy was by Bacchus bound ;</l>
     <l n="42">Wine is to wit as water thrown on fire ,</l>
     <l n="43">By duly sprinkling both are raised the higher ;</l>
     <l n="44">Thus largely dealt , the vivid blaze they choke ,</l>
     <l n="45">And all the genial flame goes off in smoke . ”</l>
     <l n="46">“ But when no more your boards these loads contain ,</l>
     <l n="47">When wine no more o'erwhelms the labouring brain ,</l>
     <l n="48">But serves , a gentle stimulus ; we know</l>
     <l n="49">How wit must sparkle , and how fancy flow . ”</l>
     <l n="50">It might be so , but no such club-days come ;</l>
     <l n="51">We always find these dampers in the room :</l>
     <l n="52">If to converse were all that brought us here ,</l>
     <l n="53">A few odd members would in turn appear ;</l>
     <l n="54">Who , dwelling nigh , would saunter in and out ,</l>
     <l n="55">O'erlook the list , and toss the books about ;</l>
     <l n="56">Or yawning read them , walking up and down ,</l>
     <l n="57">Just as the loungers in the shops in town ;</l>
     <l n="58">Till fancying nothing would their minds amuse ,</l>
     <l n="59">They 'd push them by , and go in search of news .</l>
     <l n="60">But our attractions are a stronger sort ,</l>
     <l n="61">The earliest dainties and the oldest port ;</l>
     <l n="62">All enter then with glee in every look ,</l>
     <l n="63">And not a member thinks about a book .</l>
     <l n="64">Still , let me own , there are some vacant hours ,</l>
     <l n="65">When minds might work , and men exert their powers :</l>
     <l n="66">Ere wine to folly spurs the giddy guest ,</l>
     <l n="67">But gives to wit its vigour and its zest ;</l>
     <l n="68">Then might we reason , might in turn display</l>
     <l n="69">Our several talents , and be wisely gay ;</l>
     <l n="70">We might — but who a tame discourse regards ,</l>
     <l n="71">When Whist is named , and we behold the Cards ?</l>
     <l n="72">We from that time are neither grave nor gay ;</l>
     <l n="73">Our thought , our care , our business is to play :</l>
     <l n="74">Fix 'd on these spots and figures , each attends</l>
     <l n="75">Much to his partners , nothing to his friends .</l>
     <l n="76">Our public cares , the long , the warm debate ,</l>
     <l n="77">That kept our patriots from their beds so late ;</l>
     <l n="78">War , peace , invasion , all we hope or dread ,</l>
     <l n="79">Vanish like dreams when men forsake their bed ;</l>
     <l n="80">And groaning nations and contending kings</l>
     <l n="81">Are all forgotten for these painted things ;</l>
     <l n="82">Paper and paste , vile figures and poor spots ,</l>
     <l n="83">Level all minds , philosophers and sots ;</l>
     <l n="84">And give an equal spirit , pause , and force ,</l>
     <l n="85">Join 'd with peculiar diction , to discourse :</l>
     <l n="86">“ Who deals ?— you led — we 're three by cards — had you</l>
     <l n="87">Honour in hand ? ” — “ Upon my honour , two . ”</l>
     <l n="88">Hour after hour , men thus contending sit ,</l>
     <l n="89">Grave without sense , and pointed without wit .</l>
     <l n="90">Thus it appears these envied Clubs possess</l>
     <l n="91">No certain means of social happiness ;</l>
     <l n="92">Yet there 's a good that flows from scenes like these -</l>
     <l n="93">Man meets with man at leisure and at ease ;</l>
     <l n="94">We to our neighbours and our equals come ,</l>
     <l n="95">And rub off pride that man . contracts at home ;</l>
     <l n="96">For there , admitted master , he is prone</l>
     <l n="97">To claim attention and to talk alone :</l>
     <l n="98">But here he meets with neither son nor spouse ;</l>
     <l n="99">No humble cousin to his bidding bows ;</l>
     <l n="100">To his raised voice his neighbours ’ voices rise ,</l>
     <l n="101">To his high look as lofty look replies ;</l>
     <l n="102">When much he speaks , he finds that ears are closed ,</l>
     <l n="103">And certain signs inform him when he 's prosed ;</l>
     <l n="104">Here all the value of a listener know ,</l>
     <l n="105">And claim , in turn , the favour they bestow .</l>
     <l n="106">No pleasure gives the speech , when all would speak ,</l>
     <l n="107">And all in vain a civil hearer seek .</l>
     <l n="108">To chance alone we owe the free discourse ,</l>
     <l n="109">In vain you purpose what you cannot force ;</l>
     <l n="110">‘ Tis when the favourite themes unbidden spring ,</l>
     <l n="111">That fancy soars with such unwearied wing ;</l>
     <l n="112">Then may you call in aid the moderate glass ,</l>
     <l n="113">But let it slowly and unprompted pass ;</l>
     <l n="114">So shall there all things for the end unite ,</l>
     <l n="115">And give that hour of rational delight .</l>
     <l n="116">Men to their Clubs repair , themselves to please ,</l>
     <l n="117">To care for nothing , and to take their ease ;</l>
     <l n="118">In fact , for play , for wine , for news they come :</l>
     <l n="119">Discourse is shared with friends or found at home .</l>
     <l n="120">But Cards with Books are incidental things ;</l>
     <l n="121">We 've nights devoted to these queens and kings :</l>
     <l n="122">Then if we choose the social game , we may ;</l>
     <l n="123">Now ‘ tis a duty , and we 're bound to play ;</l>
     <l n="124">Nor ever meeting of the social kind</l>
     <l n="125">Was more engaging , yet had less of mind .</l>
     <l n="126">Our eager parties , when the lunar light</l>
     <l n="127">Throws its full radiance on the festive night ,</l>
     <l n="128">Of either sex , with punctual hurry come ,</l>
     <l n="129">And fill , with one accord , an ample room ;</l>
     <l n="130">Pleased , the fresh packs on cloth of green they see ,</l>
     <l n="131">And seizing , handle with preluding glee ;</l>
     <l n="132">They draw , they sit , they shuffle , cut , and deal ;</l>
     <l n="133">Like friends assembled , but like foes to feel :</l>
     <l n="134">But yet not all ,— a happier few have joys</l>
     <l n="135">Of mere amusement , and their cards are toys ;</l>
     <l n="136">No skill nor art , nor fretful hopes have they ,</l>
     <l n="137">But while their friends are gaming , laugh and play .</l>
     <l n="138">Others there are , the veterans of the game ,</l>
     <l n="139">Who owe their pleasure to their envied fame ;</l>
     <l n="140">Through many a year with hard-contested strife ,</l>
     <l n="141">Have they attain 'd this glory of their life :</l>
     <l n="142">Such is that ancient burgess , whom in vain</l>
     <l n="143">Would gout and fever on his couch detain ;</l>
     <l n="144">And that large lady , who resolves to come ,</l>
     <l n="145">Though a first fit has warn 'd her of her doom !</l>
     <l n="146">These are as oracles : in every cause</l>
     <l n="147">They settle doubts , and their decrees are laws ;</l>
     <l n="148">But all are troubled , when , with dubious look ,</l>
     <l n="149">Diana questions what Apollo spoke .</l>
     <l n="150">Here avarice first , the keen desire of gain ,</l>
     <l n="151">Rules in each heart , and works in every brain :</l>
     <l n="152">Alike the veteran-dames and virgins feel ,</l>
     <l n="153">Nor care what graybeards or what striplings deal ;</l>
     <l n="154">Sex , age , and station , vanish from their view ,</l>
     <l n="155">And gold , their sov'reign good , the mingled crowd pursue .</l>
     <l n="156">Hence they are jealous , and as rivals , keep</l>
     <l n="157">A watchful eye on the beloved heap ;</l>
     <l n="158">Meantime discretion bids the tongue be still ,</l>
     <l n="159">And mild good-humour strives with strong ill-will</l>
     <l n="160">Till prudence fails ; when , all impatient grown ,</l>
     <l n="161">They make their grief by their suspicions known ,</l>
     <l n="162">“ Sir , I protest , were Job himself at play ,</l>
     <l n="163">He 'd rave to see you throw your cards away ;</l>
     <l n="164">Not that I care a button — not a pin</l>
     <l n="165">For what I lose ; but we had cards to win :</l>
     <l n="166">A saint in heaven would grieve to see such hand</l>
     <l n="167">Cut up by one who will not understand . ”</l>
     <l n="168">“ Complain of me ! and so you might indeed</l>
     <l n="169">If I had ventured on that foolish lead ,</l>
     <l n="170">That fatal heart — but I forgot your play -</l>
     <l n="171">Some folk have ever thrown their hearts away . ”</l>
     <l n="172">“ Yes , and their diamonds ; I have heard of one</l>
     <l n="173">Who made a beggar of an only son . ”</l>
     <l n="174">“ Better a beggar , than to see him tied</l>
     <l n="175">To art and spite , to insolence and pride . ”</l>
     <l n="176">“ Sir , were I you , I 'd strive to be polite ,</l>
     <l n="177">Against my nature , for a single night . ”</l>
     <l n="178">“ So did you strive , and , madam ! with success ;</l>
     <l n="179">I knew no being we could censure less ! ”</l>
     <l n="180">Is this too much ? Alas ! my peaceful Muse</l>
     <l n="181">Cannot with half their virulence abuse .</l>
     <l n="182">And hark ! at other tables discord reigns ,</l>
     <l n="183">With feign 'd contempt for losses and for gains ;</l>
     <l n="184">Passions awhile are bridled : then they rage ,</l>
     <l n="185">In waspish youth , and in resentful age ;</l>
     <l n="186">With scraps of insult — “ Sir , when next you play ,</l>
     <l n="187">Reflect whose money ‘ tis you throw away .</l>
     <l n="188">No one on earth can less such things regard ,</l>
     <l n="189">But when one 's partner does n't know a card -</l>
     <l n="190">I scorn suspicion , ma'am , but while you stand</l>
     <l n="191">Behind that lady , pray keep down your hand . ”</l>
     <l n="192">“ Good heav'n , revoke : remember , if the set</l>
     <l n="193">Be lost , in honour you should pay the debt . ”</l>
     <l n="194">“ There , there 's your money ; but , while I have life ,</l>
     <l n="195">I 'll never more sit down with man and wife ;</l>
     <l n="196">They snap and snarl indeed , but in the heat</l>
     <l n="197">Of all their spleen , their understandings meet ;</l>
     <l n="198">They are Freemasons , and have many a sign ,</l>
     <l n="199">That we , poor devils ! never can divine :</l>
     <l n="200">May it be told , do ye divide th ’ amount ,</l>
     <l n="201">Or goes it all to family account ? ”</l>

     <l n="202">Next is the Club , where to their friends in town</l>
     <l n="203">Our country neighbours once a month come down ;</l>
     <l n="204">We term it Free-and-Easy , and yet we</l>

     <l n="61">Smart lads and light run nimbly here and there ,</l>
     <l n="62">Nor for neglected duties mourns the Bear .</l>
     <l n="63">To his retreats , on the Election-day ,</l>
     <l n="64">The losing party found their silent way ;</l>
     <l n="65">There they partook of each consoling good ,</l>
     <l n="66">Like him uncrown 'd , like him in sullen mood -</l>
     <l n="67">Threat'ning , but bound .— Here meet a social kind ,</l>
     <l n="68">Our various clubs for various cause combined ;</l>
     <l n="69">Nor has he pride , but thankful takes as gain</l>
     <l n="70">The dew-drops shaken from the Lion 's mane :</l>
     <l n="71">A thriving couple here their skill display ,</l>
     <l n="72">And share the profits of no vulgar sway .</l>
     <l n="73">Third in our Borough 's list appears the sign</l>
     <l n="74">Of a fair queen — the gracious Caroline ;</l>
     <l n="75">But in decay — each feature in the face</l>
     <l n="76">Has stain of Time , and token of disgrace .</l>
     <l n="77">The storm of winter , and the summer-sun ,</l>
     <l n="78">Have on that form their equal mischief done ;</l>
     <l n="79">The features now are all disfigured seen ,</l>
     <l n="80">And not one charm adorns th ’ insulted queen .</l>
     <l n="81">To this poor face was never paint applied ,</l>
     <l n="82">Th ’ unseemly work of cruel Time to hide ;</l>
     <l n="83">Here we may rightly such neglect upbraid ,</l>
     <l n="84">Paint on such faces is by prudence laid .</l>
     <l n="85">Large the domain , but all within combine</l>
     <l n="86">To correspond with the dishonoured sign ;</l>
     <l n="87">And all around dilapidates ; you call -</l>
     <l n="88">But none replies — they 're inattentive all :</l>
     <l n="89">At length a ruin 'd stable holds your steed ,</l>
     <l n="90">While you through large and dirty rooms proceed ,</l>
     <l n="91">Spacious and cold ; a proof they once had been</l>
     <l n="92">In honour ,— now magnificently mean ;</l>
     <l n="93">Till in some small half-furnish 'd room you rest ,</l>
     <l n="94">Whose dying fire denotes it had a guest .</l>
     <l n="95">In those you pass 'd , where former splendour reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="96">You saw the carpets torn , the paper stain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="97">Squares of discordant glass in windows fix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="98">And paper oil 'd in many a space betwixt ;</l>
     <l n="99">A soil 'd and broken sconce , a mirror crack 'd ,</l>
     <l n="100">With table underpropp 'd , and chairs new back 'd ;</l>
     <l n="101">A marble side-slab with ten thousand stains ,</l>
     <l n="102">And all an ancient Tavern 's poor remains .</l>
     <l n="103">With much entreaty , they your food prepare ,</l>
     <l n="104">And acid wine afford , with meagre fare ;</l>
     <l n="105">Heartless you sup ; and when a dozen times</l>
     <l n="106">You 've read the fractured window 's senseless rhymes ,</l>
     <l n="107">Have been assured that Phoebe Green was fair ,</l>
     <l n="108">And Peter Jackson took his supper there ;</l>
     <l n="109">You reach a chilling chamber , where you dread</l>
     <l n="110">Damps , hot or cold , from a tremendous bed ;</l>
     <l n="111">Late comes your sleep , and you are waken 'd soon</l>
     <l n="112">By rustling tatters of the old festoon .</l>
     <l n="113">O'er this large building , thus by time defaced ,</l>
     <l n="114">A servile couple has its owner placed ,</l>
     <l n="115">Who not unmindful that its style is large ,</l>
     <l n="116">To lost magnificence adapt their charge :</l>
     <l n="117">Thus an old beauty , who has long declined ,</l>
     <l n="118">Keeps former dues and dignity in mind ;</l>
     <l n="119">And wills that all attention should be paid</l>
     <l n="120">For graces vanish 'd and for charms decay 'd .</l>
     <l n="121">Few years have pass 'd , since brightly ‘ cross the way ,</l>
     <l n="122">Lights from each window shot the lengthen 'd ray ,</l>
     <l n="123">And busy looks in every face were seen ,</l>
     <l n="124">Through the warm precincts of the reigning Queen ;</l>
     <l n="125">There fires inviting blazed , and all around</l>
     <l n="126">Was heard the tinkling bells ’ seducing sound ;</l>
     <l n="127">The nimble waiters to that sound from far</l>
     <l n="128">Sprang to the call , then hasteri 'd to the bar ,</l>
     <l n="129">Where a glad priestess of the temple sway 'd ,</l>
     <l n="130">The most obedient , and the most obey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="131">Rosy and round , adorn 'd in crimson vest ,</l>
     <l n="132">And flaming ribands at her ample breast :</l>
     <l n="133">She , skill 'd like Circe , tried her guests to move ,</l>
     <l n="134">With looks of welcome and with words of love ;</l>
     <l n="135">And such her potent charms , that men unwise</l>
     <l n="136">Were soon transform 'd and fitted for the sties .</l>
     <l n="137">Her port in bottles stood , a well-stain 'd row ,</l>
     <l n="138">Drawn for the evening from the pipe below ;</l>
     <l n="139">Three powerful spirits filled a parted case ,</l>
     <l n="140">Some cordial bottles stood in secret place ;</l>
     <l n="141">Fair acid-fruits in nets above were seen ,</l>
     <l n="142">Her plate was splendid , and her glasses clean ;</l>
     <l n="143">Basins and bowls were ready on the stand ,</l>
     <l n="144">And measures clatter 'd in her powerful hand .</l>
     <l n="145">Inferior Houses now our notice claim ,</l>
     <l n="146">But who shall deal them their appropriate fame ?</l>
     <l n="147">Who shall the nice , yet known distinction , tell ,</l>
     <l n="148">Between the peal complete and single Bell ?</l>
     <l n="149">Determine ye , who on your shining nags</l>
     <l n="150">Wear oil-skin beavers , and bear seal-skin bags ;</l>
     <l n="151">Or ye , grave topers , who with coy delight</l>
     <l n="152">Snugly enjoy the sweetness of the night ;</l>
     <l n="153">Ye travellers all , superior Inns denied</l>
     <l n="154">By moderate purse , the low by decent pride ;</l>
     <l n="155">Come and determine ,— will you take your place</l>
     <l n="156">At the full Orb , or half the lunar Face ?</l>
     <l n="157">With the Black-Boy or Angel will ye dine ?</l>
     <l n="158">Will ye approve the Fountain or the Vine ?</l>
     <l n="159">Horses the white or black will ye prefer ?</l>
     <l n="160">The Silver-Swan or Swan opposed to her -</l>
     <l n="161">Rare bird ! whose form the raven-plumage decks ,</l>
     <l n="162">And graceful curve her three alluring necks ?</l>
     <l n="163">All these a decent entertainment give ,</l>
     <l n="164">And by their comforts comfortably live .</l>
     <l n="165">Shall I pass by the Boar ?— there are who cry ,</l>
     <l n="166">“ Beware the Boar , ” and pass determined by :</l>
     <l n="167">Those dreadful tusks , those little peering eyes</l>
     <l n="168">And churning chaps , are tokens to the wise .</l>
     <l n="169">There dwells a kind old Aunt , and there you see</l>
     <l n="170">Some kind young Nieces in her company ;</l>
     <l n="171">Poor village nieces , whom the tender dame</l>
     <l n="172">Invites to town , and gives their beauty Fame ;</l>
     <l n="173">The grateful sisters feel th ’ important aid ,</l>
     <l n="174">And the good Aunt is flatter 'd and repaid .</l>
     <l n="175">What , though it may some cool observers strike ,</l>
     <l n="176">That such fair sisters should be so unlike ;</l>
     <l n="177">That still another and another comes ,</l>
     <l n="178">And at the matron 's tables smiles and blooms ;</l>
     <l n="179">That all appear as if they meant to stay</l>
     <l n="180">Time undefined , nor name a parting day ;</l>
     <l n="181">And yet , though all are valued , all are dear ,</l>
     <l n="182">Causeless , they go , and seldom more appear .</l>
     <l n="183">Yet let Suspicion hide her odious head ,</l>
     <l n="184">And Scandal vengeance from a burgess dread ;</l>
     <l n="185">A pious friend , who with the ancient dame</l>
     <l n="186">At sober cribbage takes an evening game ;</l>
     <l n="187">His cup beside him , through their play he quaffs ,</l>
     <l n="188">And oft renews , and innocently laughs ;</l>
     <l n="189">Or growing serious , to the text resorts ,</l>
     <l n="190">And from the Sunday-sermon makes reports ;</l>
     <l n="191">While all , with grateful glee , his wish attend ,</l>
     <l n="192">A grave protector and a powerful friend :</l>
     <l n="193">But Slander says , who indistinctly sees ,</l>
     <l n="194">Once he was caught with Sylvia on his knees ; -</l>
     <l n="195">A cautious burgess with a careful wife</l>
     <l n="196">To be so caught !— ‘ tis false , upon my life .</l>
     <l n="197">Next are a lower kind , yet not so low</l>
     <l n="198">But they , among them , their distinctions know ;</l>
     <l n="199">And when a thriving landlord aims so high ,</l>
     <l n="200">As to exchange the Chequer for the Pye ,</l>
     <l n="201">Or from Duke William to the Dog repairs ,</l>
     <l n="202">He takes a finer coat and fiercer airs .</l>
     <l n="203">Pleased with his power , the poor man loves to say</l>
     <l n="204">What favourite Inn shall share his evening 's pay ;</l>
     <l n="205">Where he shall sit the social hour , and lose</l>
     <l n="206">His past day 's labours and his next day 's views .</l>
     <l n="207">Our Seamen too have choice ; one takes a trip</l>
     <l n="208">In the warm cabin of his favourite Ship ;</l>
     <l n="209">And on the morrow in the humbler Boat</l>
     <l n="210">He rows till fancy feels herself afloat ;</l>
     <l n="211">Can he the sign — Three Jolly Sailors — pass ,</l>
     <l n="212">Who hears a fiddle and who sees a lass ?</l>
     <l n="213">The Anchor too affords the seaman joys ,</l>
     <l n="214">In small smoked room , all clamour , crowd , and noise ;</l>
     <l n="215">Where a curved settle half surrounds the fire ,</l>
     <l n="216">Where fifty voices purl and punch require ;</l>
     <l n="217">They come for pleasure in their leisure hour ,</l>
     <l n="218">And they enjoy it to their utmost power ;</l>
     <l n="219">Standing they drink , they swearing smoke , while all</l>
     <l n="220">Call , or make ready for a second call :</l>
     <l n="221">There is no time for trifling — “ Do ye see ?</l>
     <l n="222">We drink and drub the French extempore . ”</l>
     <l n="223">See ! round the room , on every beam and balk ,</l>
     <l n="224">Are mingled scrolls of hieroglyphic chalk ;</l>
     <l n="225">Yet nothing heeded — would one stroke suffice</l>
     <l n="226">To blot out all , here honour is too nice , -</l>
     <l n="227">“ Let knavish landsmen think such dirty things ,</l>
     <l n="228">We 're British tars , and British tars are kings . ”</l>
     <l n="229">But the Green-Man shall I pass by unsung ,</l>
     <l n="230">Which mine own James upon his sign-post hung ?</l>
     <l n="231">His sign his image ,— for he was once seen</l>
     <l n="232">A squire 's attendant , clad in keeper 's green ;</l>
     <l n="233">Ere yet , with wages more and honour less ,</l>
     <l n="234">He stood behind me in a graver dress .</l>
     <l n="235">James in an evil hour went forth to woo</l>
     <l n="236">Young Juliet Hart , and was her Romeo :</l>
     <l n="237">They 'd seen the play , and thought it vastly sweet</l>
     <l n="238">For two young lovers by the moon to meet ;</l>
     <l n="239">The nymph was gentle , of her favours free ,</l>
     <l n="240">E'en at a word — no Rosalind was she ;</l>
     <l n="241">Nor , like that other Juliet , tried his truth</l>
     <l n="242">With — “ Be thy purpose marriage , gentle youth ? ”</l>
     <l n="243">But him received , and heard his tender tale ,</l>
     <l n="244">When sang the lark , and when the nightingale ;</l>
     <l n="245">So in few months the generous lass was seen</l>
     <l n="246">I ’ the way that all the Capulets had been .</l>
     <l n="247">Then first repentance seized the amorous man ,</l>
     <l n="248">And — shame on love !— he reason 'd and he ran ;</l>
     <l n="249">The thoughtful Romeo trembled for his purse ,</l>
     <l n="250">And the sad sounds , “ for better and for worse . ”</l>
     <l n="251">Yet could the Lover not so far withdraw ,</l>
     <l n="252">But he was haunted both by Love and Law ;</l>
     <l n="253">Now Law dismay 'd him as he view 'd its fangs ,</l>
     <l n="254">Now Pity seized him for his Juliet 's pangs ;</l>
     <l n="255">Then thoughts of justice and some dread of jail ,</l>
     <l n="256">Where all would blame him , and where none might bail ;</l>
     <l n="257">These drew him back , till Juliet 's hut appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="258">Where love had drawn him when he should have fear 'd .</l>
     <l n="259">There sat the father in his wicker throne ,</l>
     <l n="260">Uttering his curses in tremendous tone :</l>
     <l n="261">With foulest names his daughter he reviled ,</l>
     <l n="262">And look 'd a very Herod at the child :</l>
     <l n="263">Nor was she patient , but with equal scorn ,</l>
     <l n="264">Bade him remember when his Joe was born :</l>
     <l n="265">Then rose the mother , eager to begin</l>
     <l n="266">Her plea for frailty , when the swain came in .</l>
     <l n="267">To him she turn 'd , and other theme began ,</l>
     <l n="268">Show 'd him his boy , and bade him be a man ;</l>
     <l n="269">“ An honest man , who , when he breaks the laws ,</l>
     <l n="270">Will make a woman honest if there 's cause . ”</l>
     <l n="271">With lengthen 'd speech she proved what came to pass</l>
     <l n="272">Was no reflection on a loving lass :</l>
     <l n="273">“ If she your love as wife and mother claim ,</l>
     <l n="274">What can it matter which was first the name ?</l>
     <l n="275">But ‘ tis most base , ‘ tis perjury and theft ,</l>
     <l n="276">When a lost girl is like a widow left ;</l>
     <l n="277">The rogue who ruins .. " here the father found</l>
     <l n="278">His spouse was treading on forbidden ground .</l>
     <l n="279">“ That 's not the point , ” quoth he , “ I do n't suppose</l>
     <l n="280">My good friend Fletcher to be one of those ;</l>
     <l n="281">What 's done amiss he 'll mend in proper time -</l>
     <l n="282">I hate to hear of villany and crime :</l>
     <l n="283">‘ Twas my misfortune , in the days of youth ,</l>
     <l n="284">To find two lasses pleading for my truth ;</l>
     <l n="285">The case was hard , I would with all my soul</l>
     <l n="286">Have wedded both , but law is our control ;</l>
     <l n="287">So one I took , and when we gain 'd a home ,</l>
     <l n="288">Her friend agreed — what could she more ?— to come ;</l>
     <l n="289">And when she found that I 'd a widow 'd bed ,</l>
     <l n="290">Me she desired — what could I less ?— to wed .</l>
     <l n="291">An easier case is yours : you 've not the smart</l>
     <l n="292">That two fond pleaders cause in one man 's heart .</l>
     <l n="293">You 've not to wait from year to year distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="294">Before your conscience can be laid at rest ;</l>
     <l n="295">There smiles your bride , there sprawls your new-born son ,</l>
     <l n="296">A ring , a licence , and the thing is done . ” -</l>
     <l n="297">“ My loving James , ” — the Lass began her plea ,</l>
     <l n="298">I 'll make thy reason take a part with me ;</l>
     <l n="299">Had I been froward , skittish , or unkind ,</l>
     <l n="300">Or to thy person or thy passion blind ;</l>
     <l n="301">Had I refused , when ‘ twas thy part to pray ,</l>
     <l n="302">Or put thee off with promise and delay ;</l>
     <l n="303">Thou might'st in justice and in conscience fly ,</l>
     <l n="304">Denying her who taught thee to deny :</l>
     <l n="305">But , James , with me thou hadst an easier task ,</l>
     <l n="306">Bonds and conditions I forbore to ask ;</l>
     <l n="307">I laid no traps for thee , no plots or plans ,</l>
     <l n="308">Nor marriage named by licence or by banns ;</l>
     <l n="309">Nor would I now the parson 's aid employ ,</l>
     <l n="310">But for this cause , ” — and up she held her boy .</l>
     <l n="311">Motives like these could heart of flesh resist ?</l>
     <l n="312">James took the infant and in triumph kiss 'd ;</l>
     <l n="313">Then to his mother 's arms the child restored ,</l>
     <l n="314">Made his proud speech and pledged his worthy word .</l>
     <l n="315">“ Three times at church our banns shall publish 'd be ,</l>
     <l n="316">Thy health be drunk in bumpers three times three ;</l>
     <l n="317">And thou shalt grace ( bedeck 'd in garments gay )</l>
     <l n="318">The christening-dinner on the wedding-day . ”</l>
     <l n="319">James at my door then made his parting bow ,</l>
     <l n="320">Took the Green-Man , and is a master now .</l>

     <l n="17">Peruse these bills , and see what each can do , -</l>
     <l n="18">Behold ! the prince , the slave , the monk , the Jew ;</l>
     <l n="19">Change but the garment , and they 'll all engage</l>
     <l n="20">To take each part , and act in every age :</l>
     <l n="21">Cull 'd from all houses , what a house are they !</l>
     <l n="22">Swept from all barns , our Borough-critics say ;</l>
     <l n="23">But with some portion of a critic 's ire ,</l>
     <l n="24">We all endure them ; there are some admire :</l>
     <l n="25">They might have praise , confined to farce alone ;</l>
     <l n="26">Full well they grin , they should not try to groan ;</l>
     <l n="27">But then our servants ’ and our seamen 's wives</l>
     <l n="28">Love all that rant and rapture as their lives ;</l>
     <l n="29">He who ‘ Squire Richard 's part could well sustain ,</l>
     <l n="30">Finds as King Richard he must roar amain -</l>
     <l n="31">“ My horse ! my horse ! ” — Lo ! now to their abodes ,</l>
     <l n="32">Come lords and lovers , empresses and gods .</l>
     <l n="33">The master-mover of these scenes has made</l>
     <l n="34">No trifling gain in this adventurous trade ;</l>
     <l n="35">Trade we may term it , for he duly buys</l>
     <l n="36">Arms out of use and undirected eyes :</l>
     <l n="37">These he instructs , and guides them as he can ,</l>
     <l n="38">And vends each night the manufactured man :</l>
     <l n="39">Long as our custom lasts they gladly stay ,</l>
     <l n="40">Then strike their tents , like Tartars ! and away !</l>
     <l n="41">The place grows bare where they too long remain ,</l>
     <l n="42">But grass will rise ere they return again .</l>
     <l n="43">Children of Thespes , welcome ; knights and queens !</l>
     <l n="44">Counts ! barons ! beauties ! when before your scenes ,</l>
     <l n="45">And mighty monarchs thund'ring from your throne ;</l>
     <l n="46">Then step behind , and all your glory 's gone :</l>
     <l n="47">Of crown and palace , throne and guards bereft ,</l>
     <l n="48">The pomp is vanish 'd and the care is left .</l>
     <l n="49">Yet strong and lively is the joy they feel ,</l>
     <l n="50">When the full house secures the plenteous meal ;</l>
     <l n="51">Flatt'ring and flatter 'd , each attempts to raise</l>
     <l n="52">A brother 's merits for a brother 's praise :</l>
     <l n="53">For never hero shows a prouder heart ,</l>
     <l n="54">Than he who proudly acts a hero 's part ;</l>
     <l n="55">Nor without cause ; the boards , we know , can yield</l>
     <l n="56">Place for fierce contest , like the tented field .</l>
     <l n="57">Graceful to tread the stage , to be in turn</l>
     <l n="58">The prince we honour , and the knave we spurn ;</l>
     <l n="59">Bravely to bear the tumult of the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="60">The hiss tremendous , and the censure loud :</l>
     <l n="61">These are their parts ,— and he who these sustains ,</l>
     <l n="62">Deserves some praise and profit for his pains .</l>
     <l n="63">Heroes at least of gentler kind are they ,</l>
     <l n="64">Against whose swords no weeping widows pray ,</l>
     <l n="65">No blood their fury sheds , nor havoc marks their way .</l>
     <l n="66">Sad happy race ! soon raised and soon depress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="67">Your days all pass 'd in jeopardy and jest ;</l>
     <l n="68">Poor without prudence , with afflictions vain ,</l>
     <l n="69">Not warn 'd by misery , not enrich 'd by gain ;</l>
     <l n="70">Whom Justice , pitying , chides from place to place ,</l>
     <l n="71">A wandering , careless , wretched , merry race ,</l>
     <l n="72">Whose cheerful looks assume , and play the parts</l>
     <l n="73">Of happy rovers with repining hearts ;</l>
     <l n="74">Then cast off care , and in the mimic pain</l>
     <l n="75">Of tragic woe feel spirits light and vain ,</l>
     <l n="76">Distress and hope — the mind 's the body 's wear ,</l>
     <l n="77">The man 's affliction , and the actor 's tear :</l>
     <l n="78">Alternate times of fasting and excess</l>
     <l n="79">Are yours , ye smiling children of distress .</l>
     <l n="80">Slaves though ye be , your wandering freedom seems ,</l>
     <l n="81">And with your varying views and restless schemes ,</l>
     <l n="82">Your griefs are transient , as your joys are dreams .</l>
     <l n="83">Yet keen those griefs — ah ! what avail thy charms ,</l>
     <l n="84">Fair Juliet ! what that infant in thine arms ;</l>
     <l n="85">What those heroic lines thy patience learns ,</l>
     <l n="86">What all the aid thy present Romeo earns ,</l>
     <l n="87">Whilst thou art crowded in that lumbering wain</l>
     <l n="88">With all thy plaintive sisters to complain ?</l>
     <l n="89">Nor is there lack of labour — To rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="90">Day after day , poor scraps of prose and verse ;</l>
     <l n="91">To bear each other 's spirit , pride , and spite ;</l>
     <l n="92">To hide in rant the heart ache of the night ;</l>
     <l n="93">To dress in gaudy patchwork , and to force</l>
     <l n="94">The mind to think on the appointed course ; -</l>
     <l n="95">This is laborious , and may be defined</l>
     <l n="96">The bootless labour of the thriftless mind .</l>
     <l n="97">There is a veteran Dame : I see her stand</l>
     <l n="98">Intent and pensive with her book in hand ;</l>
     <l n="99">Awhile her thoughts she forces on her part ,</l>
     <l n="100">Then dwells on objects nearer to the heart ;</l>
     <l n="101">Across the room she paces , gets her tone ,</l>
     <l n="102">And fits her features for the Danish throne ;</l>
     <l n="103">To-night a queen — I mark her motion slow ,</l>
     <l n="104">I hear her speech , and Hamlet 's mother know .</l>
     <l n="105">Methinks ‘ tis pitiful to see her try</l>
     <l n="106">For strength of arms and energy of eye ;</l>
     <l n="107">With vigour lost , and spirits worn away ,</l>
     <l n="108">Her pomp and pride she labours to display ;</l>
     <l n="109">And when awhile she 's tried her part to act ,</l>
     <l n="110">To find her thoughts arrested by some fact ;</l>
     <l n="111">When struggles more and more severe are seen ,</l>
     <l n="112">In the plain actress than the Danish queen , -</l>
     <l n="113">At length she feels her part , she finds delight ,</l>
     <l n="114">And fancies all the plaudits of the night ;</l>
     <l n="115">Old as she is , she smiles at every speech ,</l>
     <l n="116">And thinks no youthful part beyond her reach ,</l>
     <l n="117">But as the mist of vanity again</l>
     <l n="118">Is blown away , by press of present pain ,</l>
     <l n="119">Sad and in doubt she to her purse applies</l>
     <l n="120">For cause of comfort , where no comfort lies ;</l>
     <l n="121">Then to her task she sighing turns again -</l>
     <l n="122">“ Oh ! Hamlet , thou hast cleft my heart in twain ! ”</l>
     <l n="123">And who that poor , consumptive , wither 'd thing ,</l>
     <l n="124">Who strains her slender throat and strives to sing ?</l>
     <l n="125">Panting for breath and forced her voice to drop ,</l>
     <l n="126">And far unlike the inmate of the shop ,</l>
     <l n="127">Where she , in youth and health , alert and gay ,</l>
     <l n="128">Laugh 'd off at night the labours of the day ;</l>
     <l n="129">With novels , verses , fancy 's fertile powers ,</l>
     <l n="130">And sister-converse pass 'd the evening hours :</l>
     <l n="131">But Cynthia 's soul was soft , her wishes strong ,</l>
     <l n="132">Her judgment weak , and her conclusions wrong ;</l>
     <l n="133">The morning-call and counter were her dread ,</l>
     <l n="134">And her contempt the needle and the thread :</l>
     <l n="135">But when she read a gentle damsel 's part ,</l>
     <l n="136">Her woe , her wish ! she had them all by heart .</l>
     <l n="137">At length the hero of the boards drew nigh ,</l>
     <l n="138">Who spake of love till sigh re-echo 'd sigh ;</l>
     <l n="139">He told in honey 'd words his deathless flame ,</l>
     <l n="140">And she his own by tender vows became ;</l>
     <l n="141">Nor ring nor licence needed souls so fond ,</l>
     <l n="142">Alfonso 's passion was his Cynthia 's bond :</l>
     <l n="143">And thus the simple girl , to shame betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="144">Sinks to the grave forsaken and dismay 'd .</l>
     <l n="145">Sick without pity , sorrowing without hope ,</l>
     <l n="146">See her ! the grief and scandal of the troop ;</l>
     <l n="147">A wretched martyr to a childish pride ,</l>
     <l n="148">Her woe insulted , and her praise denied :</l>
     <l n="149">Her humble talents , though derided , used ,</l>
     <l n="150">Her prospects lost , her confidence abused ;</l>
     <l n="151">All that remains — for she not long can brave</l>
     <l n="152">Increase of evils — is an early grave .</l>
     <l n="153">Ye gentle Cynthias of the shop , take heed</l>
     <l n="154">What dreams you cherish , and what books ye read !</l>
     <l n="155">A decent sum had Peter Nottage made ,</l>
     <l n="156">By joining bricks — to him a thriving trade :</l>
     <l n="157">Of his employment master and his wife ,</l>
     <l n="158">This humble tradesman led a lordly life ;</l>
     <l n="159">The house of kings and heroes lack 'd repairs ,</l>
     <l n="160">And Peter , though reluctant , served the Players :</l>
     <l n="161">Connected thus , he heard in way polite , -</l>
     <l n="162">“ Come , Master Nottage , see us play to night , ”</l>
     <l n="163">At first ‘ twas folly , nonsense , idle stuff ,</l>
     <l n="164">But seen for nothing it grew well enough ;</l>
     <l n="165">And better now — now best , and every night ,</l>
     <l n="166">In this fool 's paradise he drank delight ;</l>
     <l n="167">And as he felt the bliss , he wish 'd to know</l>
     <l n="168">Whence all this rapture and these joys could flow ;</l>
     <l n="169">For if the seeing could such pleasure bring ,</l>
     <l n="170">What must the feeling ?— feeling like a king ?</l>
     <l n="171">In vain his wife , his uncle , and his friend ,</l>
     <l n="172">Cried — “ Peter ! Peter ! let such follies end ;</l>
     <l n="173">‘ Tis well enough these vagabonds to see ,</l>
     <l n="174">But would you partner with a showman be ? ”</l>
     <l n="175">“ Showman ! ” said Peter , “ did not Quin and Clive ,</l>
     <l n="176">And Roscius-Garrick , by the science thrive ?</l>
     <l n="177">Showman !— ‘ tis scandal ; I 'm by genius led</l>
     <l n="178">To join a class who 've Shakspeare at their head . ”</l>
     <l n="179">Poor Peter thus by easy steps became</l>
     <l n="180">A dreaming candidate for scenic fame ,</l>
     <l n="181">And , after years consumed , infirm and poor ,</l>
     <l n="182">He sits and takes the tickets at the door .</l>
     <l n="183">Of various men these marching troops are made , -</l>
     <l n="184">Pen-spurning clerks , and lads contemning trade ;</l>
     <l n="185">Waiters and servants by confinement teased ,</l>
     <l n="186">And youths of wealth by dissipation eased ;</l>
     <l n="187">With feeling nymphs , who , such resource at hand ,</l>
     <l n="188">Scorn to obey the rigour of command ;</l>
     <l n="189">Some , who from higher views by vice are won ,</l>
     <l n="190">And some of either sex by love undone ;</l>
     <l n="191">The greater part lamenting as their fall ,</l>
     <l n="192">What some an honour and advancement call .</l>
     <l n="193">There are who names in shame or fear assume ,</l>
     <l n="194">And hence our Bevilles and our Savilles come ;</l>
     <l n="195">It honours him , from tailor 's board kick 'd down ,</l>
     <l n="196">As Mister Dormer to amuse the town ;</l>
     <l n="197">Falling , he rises : but a kind there are</l>
     <l n="198">Who dwell on former prospects , and despair ;</l>
     <l n="199">Justly but vainly they their fate deplore ,</l>
     <l n="200">And mourn their fall , who fell to rise no more .</l>
     <l n="201">Our merchant Thompson , with his sons around ,</l>
     <l n="202">Most mind and talent in his Frederick found :</l>
     <l n="203">He was so lively , that his mother knew ,</l>
     <l n="204">If he were taught , that honour must ensue ;</l>
     <l n="205">The father 's views were in a different line , -</l>
     <l n="206">But if at college he were sure to shine .</l>
     <l n="207">Then should he go — to prosper who could doubt ?</l>
     <l n="208">When schoolboy stigmas would be all wash 'd out ,</l>
     <l n="209">For there were marks upon his youthful face ,</l>
     <l n="210">‘ Twixt vice and error — a neglected case -</l>
     <l n="211">These would submit to skill ; a little time ,</l>
     <l n="212">And none could trace the error or the crime ;</l>
     <l n="213">Then let him go , and once at college , he</l>
     <l n="214">Might choose his station — what would Frederick be .</l>
     <l n="215">‘ Twas soon determined — He could not descend</l>
     <l n="216">To pedant-laws and lectures without end ;</l>
     <l n="217">And then the chapel — night and morn to pray ,</l>
     <l n="218">Or mulct and threaten 'd if he kept away ;</l>
     <l n="219">No ! not to be a bishop — so he swore ,</l>
     <l n="220">And at his college he was seen no more .</l>
     <l n="221">His debts all paid , the father , with a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="222">Placed him in office — “ Do , my Frederick , try :</l>
     <l n="223">Confine thyself a few short months and then -  ”</l>
     <l n="224">He tried a fortnight , and threw down the pen .</l>
     <l n="225">Again demands were hush 'd : “ My son , you 're free ,</l>
     <l n="226">But you 're unsettled ; take your chance at sea : ”</l>
     <l n="227">So in few days the midshipman , equipp 'd</l>
     <l n="228">Received the mother 's blessing , and was shipp 'd .</l>
     <l n="229">Hard was her fortune ! soon compell 'd to meet</l>
     <l n="230">The wretched stripling staggering through the street ;</l>
     <l n="231">For , rash , impetuous , insolent , and vain ,</l>
     <l n="232">The Captain sent him to his friends again :</l>
     <l n="233">About the Borough roved th ’ unnappy boy ,</l>
     <l n="234">And ate the bread of every chance-employ !</l>
     <l n="235">Of friends he borrow 'd , and the parents yet</l>
     <l n="236">In secret fondness authorized the debt ;</l>
     <l n="237">The younger sister , still a child , was taught</l>
     <l n="238">To give with feign 'd affright the pittance sought ;</l>
     <l n="239">For now the father cried — “ It is too late</l>
     <l n="240">For trial more — I leave him to his fate , ” -</l>
     <l n="241">Yet left him not : and with a kind of joy ,</l>
     <l n="242">The mother heard of her desponding boy ;</l>
     <l n="243">At length he sicken 'd , and he found , when sick ,</l>
     <l n="244">All aid was ready , all attendance quick ;</l>
     <l n="245">A fever seized him , and at once was lost</l>
     <l n="246">The thought of trespass , error , crime , and cost :</l>
     <l n="247">Th ’ indulgent parents , knelt beside the youth ,</l>
     <l n="248">They heard his promise and believed his truth ;</l>
     <l n="249">And when the danger lessen 'd on their view ,</l>
     <l n="250">They cast off doubt , and hope assurance grew ; -</l>
     <l n="251">Nursed by his sisters , cherish 'd by his sire ,</l>
     <l n="252">Begg 'd to be glad , encouraged to aspire ,</l>
     <l n="253">His life , they said , would now all care repay ,</l>
     <l n="254">And he might date his prospects from that day ;</l>
     <l n="255">A son , a brother to his home received ,</l>
     <l n="256">They hoped for all things , and in all believed .</l>
     <l n="257">And now will pardon , comfort , kindness draw</l>
     <l n="258">The youth from vice ? will honour , duty , law ?</l>
     <l n="259">Alas ! not all : the more the trials lent ,</l>
     <l n="260">The less he seem 'd to ponder and repent ;</l>
     <l n="261">Headstrong , determined in his own career ,</l>
     <l n="262">He thought reproof unjust and truth severe ;</l>
     <l n="263">The soul 's disease was to its crisis come ,</l>
     <l n="264">He first abused and then abjured his home ;</l>
     <l n="265">And when he chose a vagabond to be ,</l>
     <l n="266">He made his shame his glory — “ I 'll be free . ”</l>
     <l n="267">Friends , parents , relatives , hope , reason , love ,</l>
     <l n="268">With anxious ardour for that empire strove ;</l>
     <l n="269">In vain their strife , in vain the means applied ,</l>
     <l n="270">They had no comfort , but that all were tried ;</l>
     <l n="271">One strong vain trial made , the mind to move ,</l>
     <l n="272">Was the last effort of parental love .</l>
     <l n="273">E'en then he watch 'd his father from his home ,</l>
     <l n="274">And to his mother would for pity come ,</l>
     <l n="275">Where , as he made her tender terrors rise ,</l>
     <l n="276">He talk 'd of death , and threaten 'd for supplies .</l>
     <l n="277">Against a youth so vicious and undone ,</l>
     <l n="278">All hearts were closed , and every door but one :</l>
     <l n="279">The Players received him ; they with open heart</l>
     <l n="280">Gave him his portion and assign 'd his part ;</l>
     <l n="281">And ere three days were added to his life ,</l>
     <l n="282">He found a home , a duty , and a wife .</l>
     <l n="283">His present friends , though they were nothing nice ,</l>
     <l n="284">Nor ask 'd how vicious he , or what his vice ,</l>
     <l n="285">Still they expected he should now attend</l>
     <l n="286">To the joint duty as a useful friend ;</l>
     <l n="287">The leader too declared , with frown severe ,</l>
     <l n="288">That none should pawn a robe that kings might wear ;</l>
     <l n="289">And much it moved him , when he Hamlet play 'd ,</l>
     <l n="290">To see his Father 's Ghost so drunken made :</l>
     <l n="291">Then too the temper , the unbending pride</l>
     <l n="292">Of this ally , would no reproof abide : -</l>
     <l n="293">So leaving these , he march 'd away and join 'd</l>
     <l n="294">Another troop , and other goods purloin 'd ;</l>
     <l n="295">And other characters , both gay and sage ,</l>
     <l n="296">Sober and sad , made stagger on the stage .</l>
     <l n="297">Then to rebuke with arrogant disdain ,</l>
     <l n="298">He gave abuse , and sought a home again .</l>
     <l n="299">Thus changing scenes , but with unchanging vice ,</l>
     <l n="300">Engaged by many , but with no one twice :</l>
     <l n="301">Of this , a last and poor resource , bereft ,</l>
     <l n="302">He to himself , unhappy guide ! was left -</l>
     <l n="303">And who shall say where guided ? to what seats</l>
     <l n="304">Of starving villany ? of thieves and cheats ?</l>
     <l n="305">In that sad time of many a dismal scene</l>
     <l n="306">Had he a witness , not inactive , been ;</l>
     <l n="307">Had leagued with petty pilferers , and had crept</l>
     <l n="308">Where of each sex degraded numbers slept :</l>
     <l n="309">With such associates he was long allied ,</l>
     <l n="310">Where his capacity for ill was tried ,</l>
     <l n="311">And that once lost , the wretch was cast aside ,</l>
     <l n="312">For now , though willing with the worst to act ,</l>
     <l n="313">He wanted powers for an important fact ;</l>
     <l n="314">And while he felt as lawless spirits feel ,</l>
     <l n="315">His hand was palsied , and he could n't steal .</l>
     <l n="316">By these rejected , is their lot so strange ,</l>
     <l n="317">So low ! that he could suffer by the change ?</l>
     <l n="318">Yes ! the new station as a fall we judge , -</l>
     <l n="319">He now became the harlots ’ humble drudge ,</l>
     <l n="320">Their drudge in common ; they combined to save</l>
     <l n="321">Awhile from starving their submissive slave ;</l>
     <l n="322">For now his spirit left him , and his pride ,</l>
     <l n="323">His scorn , his rancour , and resentment died ;</l>
     <l n="324">Few were his feelings — but the keenest these ,</l>
     <l n="325">The rage of hunger , and the sigh for ease ;</l>
     <l n="326">He who abused indulgence , now became</l>
     <l n="327">By want subservient , and by misery tame ;</l>
     <l n="328">A slave , he begg 'd forbearance ; bent with pain ,</l>
     <l n="329">He shunn 'd the blow ,— “ Ah ! strike me not again , ”</l>
     <l n="330">Thus was he found : the master of a hoy</l>
     <l n="331">Saw the sad wretch whom he had known a boy ;</l>
     <l n="332">At first in doubt , but Frederick laid aside</l>
     <l n="333">All shame , and humbly for his aid applied :</l>
     <l n="334">He , tamed and smitten with the storms gone by ,</l>
     <l n="335">Look 'd for compassion through one living eye ,</l>
     <l n="336">And stretch 'd th ’ unpalsied hand : the seaman felt</l>
     <l n="337">His honest heart with gentle pity melt ,</l>
     <l n="338">And his small boon with cheerful frankness dealt ;</l>
     <l n="339">Then made inquiries of th ’ unhappy youth ,</l>
     <l n="340">Who told , nor shame forbade him , all the truth .</l>
     <l n="341">“ Young Frederick Thompson , to a chandler 's shop</l>
     <l n="342">By harlots order 'd , and afraid to stop ! -</l>
     <l n="343">What ! our good merchant 's favourite to be seen</l>
     <l n="344">In state so loathsome and in dress so mean ? ” -</l>
     <l n="345">So thought the seaman as he bade adieu ,</l>
     <l n="346">And , when in port , related all he knew .</l>
     <l n="347">But time was lost , inquiry came too late ,</l>
     <l n="348">Those whom he served knew nothing of his fate ;</l>
     <l n="349">No ! they had seized on what the sailor gave ,</l>
     <l n="350">Nor bore resistance from their abject slave .</l>
     <l n="351">The spoil obtain 'd they cast him from the door ,</l>
     <l n="352">Robb 'd , beaten , hungry , pain 'd , diseas 'd , and poor .</l>
     <l n="353">Then nature , pointing to the only spot</l>
     <l n="354">Which still had comfort for so dire a lot ,</l>
     <l n="355">Although so feeble , led him on the way ,</l>
     <l n="356">And hope look 'd forward to a happier day :</l>
     <l n="357">He thought , poor prodigal ! a father yet</l>
     <l n="358">His woes would pity and his crimes forget ;</l>
     <l n="359">Nor had he brother who with speech severe</l>
     <l n="360">Would check the pity or refrain the tear :</l>
     <l n="361">A lighter spirit in his bosom rose ,</l>
     <l n="362">As near the road he sought an hour 's repose .</l>
     <l n="363">And there he found it : he had left the town ,</l>
     <l n="364">But buildings yet were scatter 'd up and down ;</l>
     <l n="365">To one of these , half-ruin 'd and half-built ,</l>
     <l n="366">Was traced this child of wretchedness and guilt ;</l>
     <l n="367">There , on the remnant of a beggar 's vest ,</l>
     <l n="368">Thrown by in scorn , the sufferer sought for rest ;</l>
     <l n="369">There was this scene of vice and woe to close ,</l>
     <l n="370">And there the wretched body found repose . { 5 }</l>

     <l n="13">LEAVE now our streets , and in yon plain behold</l>
     <l n="14">Those pleasant Seats for the reduced and old ;</l>
     <l n="15">A merchant 's gift , whose wife and children died ,</l>
     <l n="16">When he to saving all his powers applied ;</l>
     <l n="17">He wore his coat till bare was every thread ,</l>
     <l n="18">And with the meanest fare his body fed .</l>
     <l n="19">He had a female cousin , who with care</l>
     <l n="20">Walk 'd in his steps , and learn 'd of him to spare ;</l>
     <l n="21">With emulation and success they strove ,</l>
     <l n="22">Improving still , still seeking to improve ,</l>
     <l n="23">As if that useful knowledge they would gain -</l>
     <l n="24">How little food would human life sustain :</l>
     <l n="25">No pauper came their table 's crumbs to crave ;</l>
     <l n="26">Scraping they lived , but not a scrap they gave :</l>
     <l n="27">When beggars saw the frugal Merchant pass ,</l>
     <l n="28">It moved their pity , and they said , “ Alas !</l>
     <l n="29">Hard is thy fate my brother , ” and they felt</l>
     <l n="30">A beggar 's pride as they that pity dealt .</l>
     <l n="31">The dogs , who learn of man to scorn the poor ,</l>
     <l n="32">Bark 'd him away from every decent door ;</l>
     <l n="33">While they who saw him bare , but thought him rich ,</l>
     <l n="34">To show respect or scorn , they knew not which .</l>
     <l n="35">But while our Merchant seemed so base and mean ,</l>
     <l n="36">He had his wanderings , sometimes “ not unseen ; ”</l>
     <l n="37">To give in secret was a favourite act ,</l>
     <l n="38">Yet more than once they took him in the fact</l>
     <l n="39">To scenes of various woe he nightly went ,</l>
     <l n="40">And serious sums in healing misery spent ;</l>
     <l n="41">Oft has he cheer 'd the wretched at a rate</l>
     <l n="42">For which he daily might have dined on plate ;</l>
     <l n="43">He has been seen — his hair all silver-white ,</l>
     <l n="44">Shaking and shining — as he stole by night ,</l>
     <l n="45">To feed unenvied on his still delight .</l>
     <l n="46">A twofold taste he had ; to give and spare ,</l>
     <l n="47">Both were his duties , and had equal care ;</l>
     <l n="48">It was his joy to sit alone and fast ,</l>
     <l n="49">Then send a widow and her boys repast :</l>
     <l n="50">Tears in his eyes would spite of him appear ,</l>
     <l n="51">But he from other eyes has kept the tear :</l>
     <l n="52">All in a wint'ry night from far he came ,</l>
     <l n="53">To soothe the sorrows of a suffering dame ;</l>
     <l n="54">Whose husband robb 'd him , and to whom he meant</l>
     <l n="55">A ling'ring , but reforming punishment :</l>
     <l n="56">Home then he walked , and found his anger rise</l>
     <l n="57">When fire and rushlight met his troubled eyes ;</l>
     <l n="58">But these extinguish 'd , and his prayer address 'd</l>
     <l n="59">To Heaven in hope , he calmly sank to rest .</l>
     <l n="60">His seventieth year was pass 'd and then was seen</l>
     <l n="61">A building rising on the northern green ;</l>
     <l n="62">There was no blinding all his neighbours ’ eyes ,</l>
     <l n="63">Or surely no one would have seen it rise :</l>
     <l n="64">Twelve rooms contiguous stood , and six were near ,</l>
     <l n="65">There men were placed , and sober matrons here :</l>
     <l n="66">There were behind small useful gardens made ,</l>
     <l n="67">Benches before , and trees to give them shade ;</l>
     <l n="68">In the first room were seen above , below ,</l>
     <l n="69">Some marks of taste , a few attempts at show .</l>
     <l n="70">The founder 's picture and his arms were there</l>
     <l n="71">( Not till he left us ) , and an elbow 'd chair ;</l>
     <l n="72">There , ‘ mid these signs of his superior place ,</l>
     <l n="73">Sat the mild ruler of this humble race .</l>
     <l n="74">Within the row are men who strove in vain ,</l>
     <l n="75">Through years of trouble , wealth and ease to gain ;</l>
     <l n="76">Less must they have than an appointed sum ,</l>
     <l n="77">And freemen been , or hither must not come ;</l>
     <l n="78">They should be decent , and command respect ,</l>
     <l n="79">( Though needing fortune ) , whom these doors protect ,</l>
     <l n="80">And should for thirty dismal years have tried</l>
     <l n="81">For peace unfelt and competence denied .</l>
     <l n="82">Strange ! that o'er men thus train 'd in sorrow 's school ,</l>
     <l n="83">Power must be held , and they must live by rule ;</l>
     <l n="84">Infirm , corrected by misfortunes , old ,</l>
     <l n="85">Their habits settled and their passions cold ;</l>
     <l n="86">Of health , wealth , power , and worldly cares bereft ,</l>
     <l n="87">Still must they not at liberty be left ;</l>
     <l n="88">There must be one to rule them , to restrain</l>
     <l n="89">And guide the movements of his erring train .</l>
     <l n="90">If then control imperious , check severe ,</l>
     <l n="91">Be needed where such reverend men appear ;</l>
     <l n="92">To what would youth , without such checks , aspire ,</l>
     <l n="93">Free the wild wish , uncurb 'd the strong desire ?</l>
     <l n="94">And where ( in college or in camp ) they found</l>
     <l n="95">The heart ungovern 'd and the hand unbound ?</l>
     <l n="96">His house endow 'd , the generous man resign 'd</l>
     <l n="97">All power to rule , nay power of choice declined ;</l>
     <l n="98">He and the female saint survived to view</l>
     <l n="99">Their work complete , and bade the world adieu !</l>
     <l n="100">Six are the Guardians of this happy seat ,</l>
     <l n="101">And one presides when they on business meet ;</l>
     <l n="102">As each expires , the five a brother choose ;</l>
     <l n="103">Nor would Sir Denys Brand the charge refuse ;</l>
     <l n="104">True , ‘ twas beneath him , “ but to do men good</l>
     <l n="105">Was motive never by his heart withstood : ”</l>
     <l n="106">He too is gone , and they again must strive</l>
     <l n="107">To find a man in whom his gifts survive .</l>
     <l n="108">Now , in the various records of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="109">Thy worth , Sir Denys , shall be weigh 'd and read ;</l>
     <l n="110">There we the glory of thy house shall trace ,</l>
     <l n="111">With each alliance of thy noble race .</l>
     <l n="112">Yes ! here we have him !— “ Came in William 's reign ,</l>
     <l n="113">The Norman Brand ; the blood without a stain ;</l>
     <l n="114">From the fierce Dane and ruder Saxon clear ,</l>
     <l n="115">Pict , Irish , Scot , or Cambrian mountaineer :</l>
     <l n="116">But the pure Norman was the sacred spring ,</l>
     <l n="117">And he , Sir Denys , was in heart a king :</l>
     <l n="118">Erect in person and so firm in soul ,</l>
     <l n="119">Fortune he seem 'd to govern and control :</l>
     <l n="120">Generous as he who gives his all away ,</l>
     <l n="121">Prudent as one who toils for weekly pay ;</l>
     <l n="122">In him all merits were decreed to meet ,</l>
     <l n="123">Sincere though cautious , frank and yet discreet ,</l>
     <l n="124">Just all his dealings , faithful every word ,</l>
     <l n="125">His passions ’ master , and his temper 's lord . ”</l>
     <l n="126">Yet more , kind dealers in decaying fame ?</l>
     <l n="127">His magnanimity you next proclaim ;</l>
     <l n="128">You give him learning , join 'd with sound good sense ,</l>
     <l n="129">And match his wealth with his benevolence ;</l>
     <l n="130">What hides the multitude of sins , you add ,</l>
     <l n="131">Yet seem to doubt if sins he ever had .</l>
     <l n="132">Poor honest Truth ! thou writ'st of living men ,</l>
     <l n="133">And art a railer and detractor then ;</l>
     <l n="134">They die , again to be described , and now</l>
     <l n="135">A foe to merit and mankind art thou !</l>
     <l n="136">Why banish Truth ? It injures not the dead ,</l>
     <l n="137">It aids not them with flattery to be fed ;</l>
     <l n="138">And when mankind such perfect pictures view ,</l>
     <l n="139">They copy less , the more they think them true .</l>
     <l n="140">Let us a mortal as he was behold ,</l>
     <l n="141">And see the dross adhering to the gold ;</l>
     <l n="142">When we the errors of the virtuous state ,</l>
     <l n="143">Then erring men their worth may emulate .</l>
     <l n="144">View then this picture of a noble mind ,</l>
     <l n="145">Let him be wise , magnanimous , and kind ;</l>
     <l n="146">What was the wisdom ? Was it not the frown</l>
     <l n="147">That keeps all question , all inquiry down ?</l>
     <l n="148">His words were powerful and decisive all ,</l>
     <l n="149">But his slow reasons came for no man 's call .</l>
     <l n="150">“ ‘ Tis thus , ” he cried , no doubt with kind intent ,</l>
     <l n="151">To give results and spare all argument : -</l>
     <l n="152">“ Let it be spared — all men at least agree</l>
     <l n="153">Sir Denys Brand had magnanimity :</l>
     <l n="154">His were no vulgar charities ; none saw</l>
     <l n="155">Him like the Merchant to the hut withdraw ;</l>
     <l n="156">He left to meaner minds the simple deed ,</l>
     <l n="157">By which the houseless rest , the hungry feed</l>
     <l n="158">His was a public bounty vast and grand ,</l>
     <l n="159">‘ Twas not in him to work with viewless hand ;</l>
     <l n="160">He raised the Room that towers above the street ,</l>
     <l n="161">A public room where grateful parties meet ;</l>
     <l n="162">He first the Life-boat plann 'd ; to him the place</l>
     <l n="163">Is deep in debt — ‘ twas he revived the Race ;</l>
     <l n="164">To every public act this hearty friend</l>
     <l n="165">Would give with freedom or with frankness lend ;</l>
     <l n="166">His money built the Jail , nor prisoner yet</l>
     <l n="167">Sits at his ease , but he must feel the debt ;</l>
     <l n="168">To these let candour add his vast display ;</l>
     <l n="169">Around his mansion all is grand and gay ,</l>
     <l n="170">And this is bounty with the name of pay . ”</l>
     <l n="171">I grant the whole , nor from one deed retract ,</l>
     <l n="172">But wish recorded too the private act :</l>
     <l n="173">All these were great , but still our hearts approve</l>
     <l n="174">Those simpler tokens of the Christian love ;</l>
     <l n="175">‘ Twould give me joy some gracious deed to meet</l>
     <l n="176">That has not call 'd for glory through the street :</l>
     <l n="177">Who felt for many , could not always shun ,</l>
     <l n="178">In some soft moment , to be kind to one ;</l>
     <l n="179">And yet they tell us , when Sir Denys died ,</l>
     <l n="180">That not a widow in the Borough sigh 'd ;</l>
     <l n="181">Great were his gifts , his mighty heart I own ,</l>
     <l n="182">But why describe what all the world has known ?</l>
     <l n="183">The rest is petty pride , the useless art</l>
     <l n="184">Of a vain mind to hide a swelling heart :</l>
     <l n="185">Small was his private room : men found him there</l>
     <l n="186">By a plain table , on a paltry chair ;</l>
     <l n="187">A wretched floor-cloth , and some prints around ,</l>
     <l n="188">The easy purchase of a single pound :</l>
     <l n="189">These humble trifles and that study small</l>
     <l n="190">Make a strong contrast with the servants ’ hall ;</l>
     <l n="191">There barely comfort , here a proud excess ,</l>
     <l n="192">The pompous seat of pamper 'd idleness ,</l>
     <l n="193">Where the sleek rogues with one consent declare ,</l>
     <l n="194">They would not live upon his honour 's fare ;</l>
     <l n="195">He daily took but one half hour to dine ,</l>
     <l n="196">On one poor dish and some three sips of wine ;</l>
     <l n="197">Then he 'd abuse them for their sumptuous feasts ,</l>
     <l n="198">And say , “ My friends ! you make yourselves like beasts ;</l>
     <l n="199">One dish suffices any man to dine ,</l>
     <l n="200">But you are greedy as a herd of swine ;</l>
     <l n="201">Learn to be temperate . ” — Had they dared t'obey ,</l>
     <l n="202">He would have praised and turn 'd them all away .</l>
     <l n="203">Friends met Sir Denys riding in his ground ,</l>
     <l n="204">And there the meekness of his spirit found :</l>
     <l n="205">For that gray coat , not new for many a year ,</l>
     <l n="206">Hides all that would like decent dress appear ;</l>
     <l n="207">An old brown pony ‘ twas his will to ride ,</l>
     <l n="208">Who shuffled onward , and from side to side ;</l>
     <l n="209">A five-pound purchase , but so fat and sleek ,</l>
     <l n="210">His very plenty made the creature weak .</l>
     <l n="211">“ Sir Denys Brand ! and on so poor a steed ! ”</l>
     <l n="212">“ Poor ! it may be — such things I never heed : ”</l>
     <l n="213">And who that youth behind , of pleasant mien ,</l>
     <l n="214">Equipped as one who wishes to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="215">Upon a horse , twice victor for a plate ,</l>
     <l n="216">A noble hunter , bought at dearest rate ? -</l>
     <l n="217">Him the lad fearing yet resolved to guide ,</l>
     <l n="218">He curbs his spirit while he strokes his pride .</l>
     <l n="219">“ A handsome youth , Sir Denys ; and a horse</l>
     <l n="220">Of finer figure never trod the course , -</l>
     <l n="221">Yours , without question ? ” — “ Yes ! I think a groom</l>
     <l n="222">Bought me the beast ; I cannot say the sum</l>
     <l n="223">I ride him not ; it is a foolish pride</l>
     <l n="224">Men have in cattle — but my people ride ;</l>
     <l n="225">The boy is — hark ye , sirrah ! what 's your name ?</l>
     <l n="226">Ay , Jacob , yes ! I recollect — the same ;</l>
     <l n="227">As I bethink me now , a tenant 's son -</l>
     <l n="228">I think a tenant ,— is your father one ? ”</l>
     <l n="229">There was an idle boy who ran about ,</l>
     <l n="230">And found his master 's humble spirit out ;</l>
     <l n="231">He would at awful distance snatch a look ,</l>
     <l n="232">Then run away and hide him in some nook ;</l>
     <l n="233">“ For oh ! ” quoth he , “ I dare not fix my sight</l>
     <l n="234">On him , his grandeur puts me in a fright ;</l>
     <l n="235">Oh ! Mister Jacob , when you wait on him ,</l>
     <l n="236">Do you not quake and tremble every limb ? ”</l>
     <l n="237">The Steward soon had orders — “ Summers , see</l>
     <l n="238">That Sam be clothed , and let him wait on me . ”</l>

     <l n="239">Sir Denys died , bequeathing all affairs</l>
     <l n="240">In trust to Laughton 's long-experienced cares ;</l>
     <l n="241">Before a Guardian , and Sir Denys dead ,</l>
     <l n="242">All rule and power devolved upon his head ,</l>
     <l n="243">Numbers are call 'd to govern , but in fact</l>
     <l n="244">Only the powerful and assuming act .</l>
     <l n="245">Laughton , too wise to be a dupe to fame ,</l>
     <l n="246">Cared not a whit of what descent he came ,</l>
     <l n="247">Till he was rich ; he then conceived the thought</l>
     <l n="248">To fish for pedigree , but never caught :</l>
     <l n="249">All his desire , when he was young and poor ,</l>
     <l n="250">Was to advance ; he never cared for more :</l>
     <l n="251">“ Let me buy , sell , be factor , take a wife ,</l>
     <l n="252">Take any road , to get along in life . ”</l>
     <l n="253">Was he a miser then ? a robber ? foe</l>
     <l n="254">To those who trusted ? a deceiver ?— No !</l>
     <l n="255">He was ambitious ; all his powers of mind</l>
     <l n="256">Were to one end controll 'd , improved , combined ;</l>
     <l n="257">Wit , learning , judgment , were , by his account ,</l>
     <l n="258">Steps for the ladder he design 'd to mount ;</l>
     <l n="259">Such step was money : wealth was but his slave ,</l>
     <l n="260">For power he gain 'd it , and for power he gave :</l>
     <l n="261">Full well the Borough knows that he 'd the art</l>
     <l n="262">Of bringing money to the surest mart ;</l>
     <l n="263">Friends too were aids ,— they led to certain ends ,</l>
     <l n="264">Increase of power and claim on other friends .</l>
     <l n="265">A favourite step was marriage : then he gain 'd</l>
     <l n="266">Seat in our Hall , and o'er his party reign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="267">Houses and land he bought , and long 'd to buy ,</l>
     <l n="268">But never drew the springs of purchase dry ,</l>
     <l n="269">And thus at last they answer 'd every call ,</l>
     <l n="270">The failing found him ready for their fall :</l>
     <l n="271">He walks along the street , the mart , the quay ,</l>
     <l n="272">And looks and mutters , “ This belongs to me . ”</l>
     <l n="273">His passions all partook the general bent ;</l>
     <l n="274">Interest inform 'd him when he should resent ,</l>
     <l n="275">How long resist , and on what terms relent :</l>
     <l n="276">In points where he determined to succeed ,</l>
     <l n="277">In vain might reason or compassion plead ;</l>
     <l n="278">But gain 'd his point , he was the best of men ,</l>
     <l n="279">‘ Twas loss of time to be vexatious then :</l>
     <l n="280">Hence he was mild to all men whom he led ,</l>
     <l n="281">Of all who dared resist , the scourge and dread .</l>
     <l n="282">Falsehood in him was not the useless lie</l>
     <l n="283">Of boasting pride or laughing vanity :</l>
     <l n="284">It was the gainful , the persuading art ,</l>
     <l n="285">That made its way and won the doubting heart ,</l>
     <l n="286">Which argued , soften 'd , humbled , and prevail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="287">Nor was it tried till ev'ry truth had fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="288">No sage on earth could more than he despise</l>
     <l n="289">Degrading , poor , unprofitable lies .</l>
     <l n="290">Though fond of gain , and grieved by wanton waste ,</l>
     <l n="291">To social parties he had no distaste ;</l>
     <l n="292">With one presiding purpose in his view ,</l>
     <l n="293">He sometimes could descend to trifle too !</l>
     <l n="294">Yet , in these moments , he had still the art</l>
     <l n="295">To ope the looks and close the guarded heart ;</l>
     <l n="296">And , like the public host , has sometimes made</l>
     <l n="297">A grand repast , for which the guests have paid .</l>
     <l n="298">At length , with power endued and wealthy grown ,</l>
     <l n="299">Frailties and passions , long suppress 'd , were shown :</l>
     <l n="300">Then to provoke him was a dangerous thing ,</l>
     <l n="301">His pride would punish , and his temper sting ;</l>
     <l n="302">His powerful hatred sought th ’ avenging hour ,</l>
     <l n="303">And his proud vengeance struck with all his power ,</l>
     <l n="304">Save when th ’ offender took a prudent way</l>
     <l n="305">The rising storm of fury to allay :</l>
     <l n="306">This might he do , and so in safety sleep ,</l>
     <l n="307">By largely casting to the angry deep ;</l>
     <l n="308">Or , better yet ( its swelling force t'assuage ) ,</l>
     <l n="309">By pouring oil of flattery on its rage .</l>
     <l n="310">And now , of all the heart approved , possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="311">Fear 'd , favour 'd , follow 'd , dreaded , and caress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="312">He gently yields to one mellifluous joy ,</l>
     <l n="313">The only sweet that is not found to cloy ,</l>
     <l n="314">Bland adulation !— other pleasures pall</l>
     <l n="315">On the sick taste , and transient are they all ;</l>
     <l n="316">But this one sweet has such enchanting power ,</l>
     <l n="317">The more we take , the faster we devour :</l>
     <l n="318">Nauseous to those who must the dose apply ,</l>
     <l n="319">And most disgusting to the standers-by ;</l>
     <l n="320">Yet in all companies will Laughton feed ,</l>
     <l n="321">Nor care how grossly men perform the deed .</l>
     <l n="322">As gapes the nursling , or , what comes more near ,</l>
     <l n="323">Some Friendly-Island chief , for hourly cheer ;</l>
     <l n="324">When wives and slaves , attending round his seat ,</l>
     <l n="325">Prepare by turns the masticated meat ;</l>
     <l n="326">So for this master , husband , parent , friend ,</l>
     <l n="327">His ready slaves their various efforts blend ,</l>
     <l n="328">And , to their lord still eagerly inclined ,</l>
     <l n="329">Pour the crude trash of a dependent mind .</l>
     <l n="330">But let the Muse assign the man his due ,</l>
     <l n="331">Worth he possess 'd , nor were his virtues few : -</l>
     <l n="332">He sometimes help 'd the injured in their cause ;</l>
     <l n="333">His power and purse have back 'd the failing laws ;</l>
     <l n="334">He for religion has a due respect ,</l>
     <l n="335">And all his serious notions , are correct ;</l>
     <l n="336">Although he pray 'd and languish 'd for a son ,</l>
     <l n="337">He grew resign 'd when Heaven denied him one ;</l>
     <l n="338">He never to this quiet mansion sends</l>
     <l n="339">Subject unfit , in compliment to friends ;</l>
     <l n="340">Not so Sir Denys , who would yet protest</l>
     <l n="341">He always chose the worthiest and the best :</l>
     <l n="342">Not men in trade by various loss brought down ,</l>
     <l n="343">But those whose glory once amazed the town ,</l>
     <l n="344">Who their last guinea in their pleasures spent ,</l>
     <l n="345">Yet never fell so low as to repent :</l>
     <l n="346">To these his pity he could largely deal ,</l>
     <l n="347">Wealth they had known , and therefore want could feel .</l>
     <l n="348">Three seats were vacant while Sir Denys reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="349">And three such favourites their admission gain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="350">These let us view , still more to understand</l>
     <l n="351">The moral feelings of Sir Denys Brand . { 6 }</l>

    <head>LIFE OF BLANEY .</head>
    <head>Blaney , a wealthy Heir , dissipated , and reduced to Poverty — His fortune restored by Marriage ; again consumed — His Manner of Living in the West Indies — Recalled to a larger Inheritance — His more refined and expensive Luxuries — His method of quieting Conscience — Death of his Wife — Again become poor — His method of supporting Existence — His Ideas of Religion — His Habits and Connections when old — Admitted into the Alms-house .</head>
     <l n="1">OBSERVE that tall pale Veteran ! what a look</l>
     <l n="2">Of shame and guilt !— who cannot read that book ?</l>
     <l n="3">Misery and mirth are blended in his face ,</l>
     <l n="4">Much innate vileness and some outward grace ;</l>
     <l n="5">There wishes strong and stronger griefs are seen ,</l>
     <l n="6">Looks ever changed , and never one serene :</l>
     <l n="7">Show not that manner , and these features all ,</l>
     <l n="8">The serpent 's cunning , and the sinner 's fall ?</l>
     <l n="9">Hark to that laughter !— ‘ tis the way he takes</l>
     <l n="10">To force applause for each vile jest he makes ;</l>
     <l n="11">Such is yon man , by partial favour sent</l>
     <l n="12">To these calm seats to ponder and repent .</l>
     <l n="13">Blaney , a wealthy heir at twenty-one ,</l>
     <l n="14">At twenty-five was ruin 'd and undone ,</l>
     <l n="15">These years with grievous crimes we need not load ,</l>
     <l n="16">He found his ruin in the common road ! -</l>
     <l n="17">Gamed without skill , without inquiry bought ,</l>
     <l n="18">Lent without love , and borrow 'd without thought .</l>
     <l n="19">But , gay and handsome , he had soon the dower</l>
     <l n="20">Of a kind wealthy widow in his power :</l>
     <l n="21">Then he aspired to loftier flights of vice ,</l>
     <l n="22">To singing harlots of enormous price :</l>
     <l n="23">He took a jockey in his gig to buy</l>
     <l n="24">A horse so valued that a duke was shy :</l>
     <l n="25">To gain the plaudits of the knowing few ,</l>
     <l n="26">Gamblers and grooms , what would not Blaney do ?</l>
     <l n="27">His dearest friend , at that improving age ,</l>
     <l n="28">Was Hounslow Dick , who drove the western stage .</l>
     <l n="29">Cruel he was not — if he left his wife ,</l>
     <l n="30">He left her to her own pursuits in life ;</l>
     <l n="31">Deaf to reports , to all expenses blind ,</l>
     <l n="32">Profuse , not just , and careless , but not kind .</l>
     <l n="33">Yet , thus assisted , ten long winters pass 'd</l>
     <l n="34">In wasting guineas ere he saw his last ;</l>
     <l n="35">Then he began to reason , and to feel</l>
     <l n="36">He could not dig , nor had he learn 'd to steal ;</l>
     <l n="37">And should he beg as long as he might live ,</l>
     <l n="38">He justly fear 'd that nobody would give :</l>
     <l n="39">But he could charge a pistol , and at will</l>
     <l n="40">All that was mortal , by a bullet kill :</l>
     <l n="41">And he was taught , by those whom he would call</l>
     <l n="42">Man 's surest guides , that he was mortal all .</l>
     <l n="43">While thus he thought , still waiting for the day</l>
     <l n="44">When he should dare to blow his brains away ,</l>
     <l n="45">A place for him a kind relation found ,</l>
     <l n="46">Where England 's monarch ruled , but far from English ground :</l>
     <l n="47">He gave employ that might for bread suffice ,</l>
     <l n="48">Correct his habits and restrain his vice .</l>
     <l n="49">Here Blaney tried ( what such man 's miseries teach )</l>
     <l n="50">To find what pleasures were within his reach ;</l>
     <l n="51">These he enjoy 'd , though not in just the style</l>
     <l n="52">He once possess 'd them in his native isle ;</l>
     <l n="53">Congenial souls he found in every place ,</l>
     <l n="54">Vice in all soils , and charms in every race :</l>
     <l n="55">His lady took the same amusing way ,</l>
     <l n="56">And laugh 'd at Time till he had turn 'd them gray ;</l>
     <l n="57">At length for England once again they steer 'd ,</l>
     <l n="58">By ancient views and new designs endear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="59">His kindred died , and Blaney now became</l>
     <l n="60">An heir to one who never heard his name .</l>
     <l n="61">What could he now ?— The man had tried before</l>
     <l n="62">The joys of youth , and they were joys no more ;</l>
     <l n="63">To vicious pleasure he was still inclined ,</l>
     <l n="64">But vice must now be season 'd and refined ;</l>
     <l n="65">Then as a swine he would on pleasure seize ,</l>
     <l n="66">Now common pleasures had no power to please :</l>
     <l n="67">Beauty alone has for the vulgar charms ,</l>
     <l n="68">He wanted beauty trembling with alarms :</l>
     <l n="69">His was no more a youthful dream of joy ,</l>
     <l n="70">The wretch desired to ruin and destroy ;</l>
     <l n="71">He bought indulgence with a boundless price ,</l>
     <l n="72">Most pleased when decency bow 'd down to vice ,</l>
     <l n="73">When a fair dame her husband 's honour sold ,</l>
     <l n="74">And a frail countess play 'd for Blaney 's gold .</l>
     <l n="75">“ But did not conscience in her anger rise ? ”</l>
     <l n="76">Yes ! and he learn 'd her terrors to despise ;</l>
     <l n="77">When stung by thought , to soothing books he fled ,</l>
     <l n="78">And grew composed and harden 'd as he read ;</l>
     <l n="79">Tales of Voltaire , and essays gay and slight .</l>
     <l n="80">Pleased him , and shone with their phosphoric light ;</l>
     <l n="81">Which , though it rose from objects vile and base ,</l>
     <l n="82">Where'er it came threw splendour on the place ,</l>
     <l n="83">And was that light which the deluded youth ,</l>
     <l n="84">And this gray sinner , deem 'd the light of truth .</l>
     <l n="85">He different works for different cause admired ,</l>
     <l n="86">Some fix 'd his judgment , some his passions fired ;</l>
     <l n="87">To cheer the mind and raise a dormant flame ,</l>
     <l n="88">He had the books , decreed to lasting shame ,</l>
     <l n="89">Which those who read are careful not to name :</l>
     <l n="90">These won to vicious act the yielding heart ,</l>
     <l n="91">And then the cooler reasoners soothed the smart .</l>
     <l n="92">He heard of Blount , and Mandeville , and Chubb ,</l>
     <l n="93">How they the doctors of their day would drub ;</l>
     <l n="94">How Hume had dwelt on Miracles so well ,</l>
     <l n="95">That none would now believe a miracle ;</l>
     <l n="96">And though he cared not works so grave to read ,</l>
     <l n="97">He caught their faith , and sign 'd the sinner 's creed .</l>
     <l n="98">Thus was he pleased to join the laughing side ,</l>
     <l n="99">Nor ceased the laughter when his lady died ;</l>
     <l n="100">Yet was he kind and careful of her fame ,</l>
     <l n="101">And on her tomb inscribed a virtuous name ;</l>
     <l n="102">“ A tender wife , respected , and so forth , ”</l>
     <l n="103">The marble still bears witness to the worth .</l>
     <l n="104">He has some children , but he knows not where ;</l>
     <l n="105">Something they cost , but neither love nor care ;</l>
     <l n="106">A father 's feelings he has never known ,</l>
     <l n="107">His joys , his sorrows , have been all his own .</l>
     <l n="108">He now would build , and lofty seat he built ,</l>
     <l n="109">And sought , in various ways , relief from guilt .</l>
     <l n="110">Restless , for ever anxious to obtain</l>
     <l n="111">Ease for the heart by ramblings of the brain ,</l>
     <l n="112">He would have pictures , and of course a Taste ,</l>
     <l n="113">And found a thousand means his wealth to waste .</l>
     <l n="114">Newmarket steeds he bought at mighty cost ;</l>
     <l n="115">They sometimes won , but Blaney always lost .</l>
     <l n="116">Quick came his ruin , came when he had still</l>
     <l n="117">For life a relish , and in pleasure skill :</l>
     <l n="118">By his own idle reckoning he supposed</l>
     <l n="119">His wealth would last him till his life was closed ;</l>
     <l n="120">But no ! he found this final hoard was spent ,</l>
     <l n="121">While he had years to suffer and repent .</l>
     <l n="122">Yet , at the last , his noble mind to show ,</l>
     <l n="123">And in his misery how he bore the blow ,</l>
     <l n="124">He view 'd his only guinea , then suppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="125">For a short time , the tumults in his breast ,</l>
     <l n="126">And mov 'd by pride , by habit , and despair ,</l>
     <l n="127">Gave it an opera-bird to hum an air .</l>
     <l n="128">Come ye ! who live for Pleasure , come , behold</l>
     <l n="129">A man of pleasure when he 's poor and old ;</l>
     <l n="130">When he looks back through life , and cannot find</l>
     <l n="131">A single action to relieve his mind ;</l>
     <l n="132">When he looks forward , striving still to keep</l>
     <l n="133">A steady prospect of eternal sleep ;</l>
     <l n="134">When not one friend is left , of all the train</l>
     <l n="135">Whom ‘ twas his pride and boast to entertain , -</l>
     <l n="136">Friends now employ 'd from house to house to run ,</l>
     <l n="137">And say , “ Alas ! poor Blaney is undone ! ” -</l>
     <l n="138">Those whom he shook with ardour by the hand ,</l>
     <l n="139">By whom he stood as long as he could stand ,</l>
     <l n="140">Who seem 'd to him from all deception clear ,</l>
     <l n="141">And who , more strange ! might think themselves sincere .</l>
     <l n="142">Lo ! now the hero shuffling through the town ,</l>
     <l n="143">To hunt a dinner and to beg a crown ;</l>
     <l n="144">To tell an idle tale , that boys may smile ;</l>
     <l n="145">To bear a strumpet 's billet-doux a mile ;</l>
     <l n="146">To cull a wanton for a youth of wealth</l>
     <l n="147">( With reverend view to both his taste and health ) ;</l>
     <l n="148">To be a useful , needy thing between</l>
     <l n="149">Fear and desire — the pander and the screen ;</l>
     <l n="150">To flatter pictures , houses , horses , dress ,</l>
     <l n="151">The wildest fashion , or the worst excess ;</l>
     <l n="152">To be the gray seducer , and entice</l>
     <l n="153">Unbearded folly into acts of vice :</l>
     <l n="154">And then , to level every fence which law</l>
     <l n="155">And virtue fix to keep the mind in awe ,</l>
     <l n="156">He first inveigles youth to walk astray ,</l>
     <l n="157">Next prompts and soothes them in their fatal way ,</l>
     <l n="158">Then vindicates the deed , and makes the mind his prey .</l>
     <l n="159">Unhappy man ! what pains he takes to state -</l>
     <l n="160">( Proof of his fear ! ) that all below is fate ;</l>
     <l n="161">That all proceed in one appointed track ,</l>

     <l n="163">Then what is vice or virtue ?— Yet he 'll rail</l>
     <l n="164">At priests till memory and quotation fail ;</l>
     <l n="165">He reads , to learn the various ills they 've done ,</l>
     <l n="166">And calls them vipers , every mother 's son .</l>
     <l n="167">He is the harlot 's aid , who wheedling tries</l>

     <l n="178">The tale licentious , mix 'd with blasphemy :</l>
     <l n="179">No genuine gladness his narrations cause ,</l>
     <l n="180">The frailest heart denies sincere applause ;</l>
     <l n="181">And many a youth has turn 'd him half aside ,</l>
     <l n="182">And laugh 'd aloud , the sign of shame to hide .</l>
     <l n="183">Blaney , no aid in his vile cause to lose ,</l>

     <l n="190">Who shall describe what Blaney dares to show ?</l>
     <l n="191">While thus the man , to vice and passion slave ,</l>

     <l n="208">Will nothing learn , and nothing can enjoy ;</l>
     <l n="209">In temp'rate measures he must eat and drink ,</l>
     <l n="210">And , pain of pains ! must live alone and think .</l>
     <l n="211">In vain , by fortune 's smiles , thrice affluent made ,</l>
     <l n="212">Still has he debts of ancient date unpaid ;</l>
     <l n="213">Thrice into penury by error thrown ,</l>

     <l n="215">The old men shun him ,— some his vices hate ,</l>
     <l n="216">And all abhor his principles and prate ;</l>
     <l n="217">Nor love nor care for him will mortal show ,</l>

   <p>She early found herself mistress of herself . All she did was right ; all she said was admired . Early , very early , did she dismiss blushes from her cheek : she could not blush because she could not doubt ; and silence , whatever was her subject , was as much a stranger to her as diffidence .</p>

     <l n="12">In Time 's despite , to stay at twenty-five ; -</l>

     <l n="17">Her speech was lively , and with ease express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="18">And well she judged the tempers she address 'd :</l>
     <l n="19">If some soft stripling had her keenness felt ,</l>
     <l n="20">She knew the way to make his anger melt ;</l>
     <l n="21">Wit was allow 'd her , though but few could bring</l>
     <l n="22">Direct example of a witty thing ;</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Twas that gay , pleasant , smart , engaging speech ,</l>
     <l n="24">Her beaux admired , and just within their reach ;</l>
     <l n="25">Not indiscreet , perhaps , but yet more free</l>
     <l n="26">Than prudish nymphs allow their wit to be .</l>
     <l n="27">Novels and plays , with poems old and new ,</l>
     <l n="28">Were all the books our nymph attended to ;</l>
     <l n="29">Yet from the press no treatise issued forth ,</l>
     <l n="30">But she would speak precisely of its worth .</l>
     <l n="31">She with the London stage familiar grew ,</l>
     <l n="32">And every actor 's name and merit knew ;</l>
     <l n="33">She told how this or that their part mistook ,</l>
     <l n="34">And of the rival Romeos gave the look ;</l>
     <l n="35">Of either house ‘ twas hers the strength to see ,</l>
     <l n="36">Then judge with candour — “ Drury Lane for me . ”</l>
     <l n="37">What made this knowledge , what this skill complete ?</l>
     <l n="38">A fortnight 's visit in Whitechapel Street .</l>
     <l n="39">Her place in life was rich and poor between ,</l>
     <l n="40">With those a favourite , and with these a queen ;</l>
     <l n="41">She could her parts assume , and condescend</l>
     <l n="42">To friends more humble while an humble friend ;</l>
     <l n="43">And thus a welcome , lively guest could pass ,</l>
     <l n="44">Threading her pleasant way from class to class .</l>
     <l n="45">“ Her reputation ? ” — That was like her wit ,</l>
     <l n="46">And seem 'd her manner and her state to fit ;</l>
     <l n="47">Sometking there was — what , none presumed to say ;</l>
     <l n="48">Clouds lightly passing on a smiling day , -</l>
     <l n="49">Whispers and hints which went from ear to ear ,</l>
     <l n="50">And mix 'd reports no judge on earth could clear .</l>
     <l n="51">But of each sex a friendly number press 'd</l>
     <l n="52">To joyous banquets this alluring guest :</l>
     <l n="53">There , if indulging mirth , and freed from awe ,</l>
     <l n="54">If pleasing all , and pleased with all she saw ,</l>
     <l n="55">Her speech was free , and such as freely dwelt</l>
     <l n="56">On the same feelings all around her felt ;</l>
     <l n="57">Or if some fond presuming favourite tried</l>
     <l n="58">To come so near as once to be denied ;</l>
     <l n="59">Yet not with brow so stern or speech so nice ,</l>
     <l n="60">But that he ventured on denial twice : -</l>
     <l n="61">If these have been , and so has Scandal taught ,</l>
     <l n="62">Yet Malice never found the proof she sought .</l>
     <l n="63">But then came one , the Lovelace of his day ,</l>
     <l n="64">Rich , proud , and crafty , handsome , brave , and gay ;</l>
     <l n="65">Yet loved he not those labour 'd plans and arts ,</l>
     <l n="66">But left the business to the ladies ’ hearts ,</l>
     <l n="67">And when he found them in a proper train</l>
     <l n="68">He thought all else superfluous and vain :</l>
     <l n="69">But in that training he was deeply taught ,</l>
     <l n="70">And rarely fail 'd of gaining all he sought ;</l>
     <l n="71">He knew how far directly on to go ,</l>
     <l n="72">How to recede and dally to and fro ;</l>
     <l n="73">How to make all the passions his allies ,</l>
     <l n="74">And , when he saw them in contention rise ,</l>
     <l n="75">To watch the wrought-up heart , and conquer by surprise .</l>
     <l n="76">Our heroine fear 'd him not ; it was her part</l>
     <l n="77">To make sure conquest of such gentle heart -</l>
     <l n="78">Of one so mild and humble ; for she saw</l>
     <l n="79">In Henry 's eye a love chastised by awe .</l>
     <l n="80">Her thoughts of virtue were not all sublime ,</l>
     <l n="81">Nor virtuous all her thoughts ; ‘ twas now her time</l>
     <l n="82">To bait each hook , in every way to please ,</l>
     <l n="83">And the rich prize with dext'rous hand to seize .</l>
     <l n="84">She had no virgin-terrors ; she could stray</l>
     <l n="85">In all love 's maze , nor fear to lose her way ;</l>
     <l n="86">Nay , could go near the precipiee , nor dread</l>
     <l n="87">A failing caution or a giddy head ;</l>
     <l n="88">She 'd fix her eyes upon the roaring flood ,</l>
     <l n="89">And dance upon the brink where danger stood .</l>
     <l n="90">‘ Twas nature all , she judged , in one so young ,</l>
     <l n="91">To drop the eye and falter in the tongue ;</l>
     <l n="92">To be about to take , and then command</l>
     <l n="93">His daring wish , and only view the hand :</l>
     <l n="94">Yes ! all was nature ; it became a maid</l>
     <l n="95">Of gentle soul t'encourage love afraid ; -</l>
     <l n="96">He , so unlike the confident and bold ,</l>
     <l n="97">Would fly in mute despair to find her cold :</l>
     <l n="98">The young and tender germ requires the sun</l>
     <l n="99">To make it spread ; it must be smiled upon .</l>
     <l n="100">Thus the kind virgin gentle means devised ,</l>
     <l n="101">To gain a heart so fond , a hand so prized ;</l>
     <l n="102">More gentle still she grew , to change her way</l>
     <l n="103">Would cause confusion , danger , and delay :</l>
     <l n="104">Thus ( an increase of gentleness her mode ) ,</l>
     <l n="105">She took a plain , unvaried , certain road ,</l>
     <l n="106">And every hour believed success was near ,</l>
     <l n="107">Till there was nothing left to hope or fear .</l>
     <l n="108">It must be own 'd that , in this strife of hearts ,</l>
     <l n="109">Man has advantage — has superior arts :</l>
     <l n="110">The lover 's aim is to the nymph unknown ,</l>
     <l n="111">Nor is she always certain of her own ;</l>
     <l n="112">Or has her fears , nor these can so disguise ,</l>
     <l n="113">But he who searches reads them in her eyes ,</l>
     <l n="114">In the avenging frown , in the regretting sighs :</l>
     <l n="115">These are his signals , and he learns tb steer</l>
     <l n="116">The straighter course whenever they appear .</l>

    <head>BENBOW .</head>
     <l n="1">SEE ! yonder badgeman with that glowing face ,</l>
     <l n="2">A meteor shining in this sober place !</l>
     <l n="3">Vast sums were paid , and many years were past ,</l>
     <l n="4">Ere gems so rich around their radiance cast !</l>
     <l n="5">Such was the fiery front that Bardolph wore ,</l>
     <l n="6">Guiding his master to the tavern door ;</l>
     <l n="7">There first that meteor rose , and there alone ,</l>
     <l n="8">In its due place , the rich effulgence shone :</l>
     <l n="9">But this strange fire the seat of peace invades</l>
     <l n="10">And shines portentous in these solemn shades .</l>
     <l n="11">Benbow , a boon companion , long approved</l>
     <l n="12">By jovial sets , and ( as he thought ) beloved ,</l>
     <l n="13">Was judged as one to joy and friendship prone ,</l>
     <l n="14">And deem 'd injurious to himself alone :</l>
     <l n="15">Gen'rous and free , he paid but small regard</l>
     <l n="16">To trade , and fail 'd ; and some declared “ ‘ twas hard : ”</l>
     <l n="17">These were his friends — his foes conceived the case</l>
     <l n="18">Of common kind ; he sought and found disgrace :</l>
     <l n="19">The reasoning few , who neither scorn 'd nor loved ,</l>
     <l n="20">His feelings pitied and his faults reproved .</l>
     <l n="21">Benbow , the father , left possessions fair ,</l>
     <l n="22">A worthy name and business to his heir ;</l>
     <l n="23">Benbow , the son , those fair possessions sold ,</l>
     <l n="24">And lost his credit , while he spent the gold :</l>
     <l n="25">He was a jovial trader : men enjoy 'd</l>
     <l n="26">The night with him ; his day was unemployed ;</l>
     <l n="27">So when his credit and his cash were spent ,</l>
     <l n="28">Here , by mistaken pity , he was sent ;</l>
     <l n="29">Of late he came , with passions unsubdued ,</l>
     <l n="30">And shared and cursed the hated solitude ,</l>
     <l n="31">Where gloomy thoughts arise , where grievous cares intrude .</l>
     <l n="32">Known but in drink ,— he found an easy friend ,</l>
     <l n="33">Well pleased his worth and honour to commend :</l>
     <l n="34">And thus inform 'd , the guardian of the trust</l>
     <l n="35">Heard the applause , and said the claim was just ,</l>
     <l n="36">A worthy soul ! unfitted for the strife ,</l>
     <l n="37">Care , and contention of a busy life ; -</l>
     <l n="38">Worthy , and why ?— that o'er the midnight bowl</l>
     <l n="39">He made his friend the partner of his soul ,</l>
     <l n="40">And any man his friend : — then thus in glee ,</l>
     <l n="41">“ I speak my mind , I love the truth , ” quoth he ;</l>
     <l n="42">Till ‘ twas his fate that useful truth to find ,</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Tis sometimes prudent not to speak the mind .</l>
     <l n="44">With wine inflated , man is all upblown ,</l>
     <l n="45">And feels a power which he believes his own ;</l>
     <l n="46">With fancy soaring to the skies , he thinks</l>
     <l n="47">His all the virtues all the while he drinks ;</l>
     <l n="48">But when the gas from the balloon is gone ,</l>
     <l n="49">When sober thoughts and serious cares come on ,</l>
     <l n="50">Where then the worth that in himself he found ?</l>
     <l n="51">Vanish 'd — and he sank grov'lling on the ground .</l>
     <l n="52">Still some conceit will Benbow 's mind inflate ,</l>
     <l n="53">Poor as he is ,— ‘ tis pleasant to relate</l>
     <l n="54">The joys he once possess 'd — it soothes his present state .</l>
     <l n="55">Seated with some gray beadsman , he regrets</l>
     <l n="56">His former feasting , though it swell 'd his debts ;</l>
     <l n="57">Topers once famed , his friends in earlier days ,</l>
     <l n="58">Well he describes , and thinks description praise :</l>
     <l n="59">Each hero 's worth with much delight he paints ;</l>
     <l n="60">Martyrs they were , and he would make them saints .</l>
     <l n="61">“ Alas ! alas ! ” Old England now may say ,</l>
     <l n="62">“ My glory withers ; it has had its day :</l>
     <l n="63">We 're fallen on evil times ; men read and think ;</l>
     <l n="64">Our bold forefathers loved to fight and drink .</l>
     <l n="65">“ Then lived the good ‘ Squire Asgill — what a change</l>
     <l n="66">Has death and fashion shown us at the Grange !</l>
     <l n="67">He bravely thought it best became his rank</l>
     <l n="68">That all his tenants and his tradesmen drank ;</l>
     <l n="69">He was delighted from his favourite room</l>
     <l n="70">To see them ‘ cross the park go daily home</l>
     <l n="71">Praising aloud the liquor and the host ,</l>
     <l n="72">And striving who should venerate him most .</l>
     <l n="73">“ No pride had he , and there was difference small</l>
     <l n="74">Between the master 's and the servant 's hall :</l>
     <l n="75">And here or there the guests were welcome all .</l>
     <l n="76">Of Heaven 's free gifts he took no special care ,</l>
     <l n="77">He never quarrell 'd for a simple hare ;</l>
     <l n="78">But sought , by giving sport , a sportman 's name ,</l>
     <l n="79">Himself a poacher , though at other game :</l>
     <l n="80">He never planted nor inclosed — his trees</l>
     <l n="81">Grew , like himself , untroubled and at ease :</l>
     <l n="82">Bounds of all kinds he hated , and had felt</l>
     <l n="83">Chok 'd and imprison 'd in a modern belt ,</l>
     <l n="84">Which some rare genius now has twined about</l>
     <l n="85">The good old house , to keep old neighbours out .</l>
     <l n="86">Along his valleys , in the evening-hours ,</l>
     <l n="87">The borough-damsels stray 'd to gather flowers ,</l>
     <l n="88">Or by the brakes and brushwood of the park ,</l>
     <l n="89">To take their pleasant rambles in the dark .</l>
     <l n="90">“ Some prudes , of rigid kind , forbore to call</l>
     <l n="91">On the kind females — favourites at the hall ;</l>
     <l n="92">But better nature saw , with much delight ,</l>
     <l n="93">The different orders of mankind unite :</l>
     <l n="94">‘ Twas schooling pride to see the footman wait ,</l>
     <l n="95">Smile on his sister and receive her plate .</l>
     <l n="96">“ His worship ever was a churchman true ,</l>
     <l n="97">He held in scorn the Methodistic crew ;</l>
     <l n="98">‘ May God defend the Church , and save the King , ’</l>
     <l n="99">He 'd pray devoutly and divinely sing .</l>
     <l n="100">Admit that he the holy day would spend</l>
     <l n="101">As priests approved not , still he was a friend :</l>
     <l n="102">Much then I blame the preacher , as too nice ,</l>
     <l n="103">To call such trifles by the name of vice ;</l>
     <l n="104">Hinting , though gently and with cautious speech ,</l>
     <l n="105">Of good example — ‘ tis their trade to preach .</l>
     <l n="106">But still ‘ twas pity , when the worthy ‘ squire</l>
     <l n="107">Stuck to the church , what more could they require ?</l>
     <l n="108">‘ Twas almost joining that fanatic crew ,</l>
     <l n="109">To throw such morals at his honour 's pew ;</l>
     <l n="110">A weaker man , had he been so reviled ,</l>
     <l n="111">Had left the place — he only swore and smiled .</l>
     <l n="112">“ But think , ye rectors and ye curates , think ,</l>
     <l n="113">Who are your friends , and at their frailties wink ;</l>
     <l n="114">Conceive not — mounted on your Sunday-throne ,</l>
     <l n="115">Your firebrands fall upon your foes alone ;</l>
     <l n="116">They strike your patrons — and should all withdraw ,</l>
     <l n="117">In whom your wisdoms may discern a flaw ,</l>
     <l n="118">You would the flower of all your audience lose ,</l>
     <l n="119">And spend your crackers on their empty pews .</l>
     <l n="120">“ The father dead , the son has found a wife ,</l>
     <l n="121">And lives a formal , proud , unsocial life ; -</l>
     <l n="122">The lands are now inclosed ; the tenants all ,</l>
     <l n="123">Save at a rent-day , never see the hall ;</l>
     <l n="124">No lass is suffer 'd o'er the walks to come ,</l>
     <l n="125">And if there 's love , they have it all at home .</l>
     <l n="126">“ Oh ! could the ghost of our good ‘ squire arise ,</l>
     <l n="127">And see such change ; would it believe its eyes ?</l>
     <l n="128">Would it not glide about from place to place ,</l>
     <l n="129">And mourn the manners of a feebler race ?</l>
     <l n="130">At that long table , where the servants found</l>
     <l n="131">Mirth and abundance while the year went round ;</l>
     <l n="132">Where a huge pollard on the winter-fire ,</l>
     <l n="133">At a huge distance made them all retire ;</l>
     <l n="134">Where not a measure in the room was kept ,</l>
     <l n="135">And but one rule — they tippled till they slept -</l>
     <l n="136">There would it see a pale old hag preside ,</l>
     <l n="137">A thing made up of stinginess and pride ;</l>
     <l n="138">Who carves the meat , as if the flesh could feel ;</l>
     <l n="139">Careless whose flesh must miss the plenteous meal ;</l>
     <l n="140">Here would the ghost a small coal-fire behold ,</l>
     <l n="141">Not fit to keep one body from the cold ;</l>
     <l n="142">Then would it flit to higher rooms , and stay</l>
     <l n="143">To view a dull , dress 'd company at play ;</l>
     <l n="144">All the old comfort , all the genial fare</l>
     <l n="145">For ever gone ! how sternly would it stare :</l>
     <l n="146">And though it might not to their view appear ,</l>
     <l n="147">‘ Twould cause among them lassitude and fear</l>
     <l n="148">Then wait to see — where he delight has seen -</l>
     <l n="149">The dire effect of fretfulness and spleen .</l>
     <l n="150">“ Such were the worthies of these better days ;</l>
     <l n="151">We had their blessings — they shall have our praise .</l>
     <l n="152">“ Of Captain Dowling would you hear me speak ?</l>
     <l n="153">I 'd sit and sing his praises for a week :</l>
     <l n="154">He was a man , and man-like all his joy , -</l>
     <l n="155">I 'm led to question was he ever boy ?</l>
     <l n="156">Beef was his breakfast ;— if from sea and salt ,</l>
     <l n="157">It relish 'd better with his wine of malt ;</l>
     <l n="158">Then , till he dined , if walking in or out ,</l>
     <l n="159">Whether the gravel teased him or the gout ,</l>
     <l n="160">Though short in wind and flannell 'd every limb ,</l>
     <l n="161">He drank with all who had concerns with him :</l>
     <l n="162">Whatever trader , agent , merchant , came ,</l>
     <l n="163">They found him ready , every hour the same ;</l>
     <l n="164">Whatever liquors might between them pass ,</l>
     <l n="165">He took them all , and never balk 'd his glass :</l>
     <l n="166">Nay , with the seamen working in the ship ,</l>
     <l n="167">At their request , he 'd share the grog and flip .</l>
     <l n="168">But in the club-room was his chief delight ,</l>
     <l n="169">And punch the favourite liquor of the night ;</l>
     <l n="170">Man after man they from the trial shrank ,</l>
     <l n="171">And Dowling ever was the last who drank :</l>
     <l n="172">Arrived at home , he , ere he sought his bed ,</l>
     <l n="173">With pipe and brandy would compose his head ,</l>
     <l n="174">Then half an hour was o'er the news beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="175">When he retired as harmless as a child .</l>
     <l n="176">Set but aside the gravel and the gout .</l>
     <l n="177">And breathing short — his sand ran fairly out .</l>
     <l n="178">“ At fifty-five we lost him — after that</l>
     <l n="179">Life grows insipid and its pleasures flat ;</l>
     <l n="180">He had indulged in all that man can have ,</l>
     <l n="181">He did not drop a dotard to his grave ;</l>
     <l n="182">Still to the last , his feet upon the chair ,</l>
     <l n="183">With rattling lungs now gone beyond repair ;</l>
     <l n="184">When on each feature death had fix 'd his stamp ,</l>
     <l n="185">And not a doctor could the body vamp ;</l>
     <l n="186">Still at the last , to his beloved bowl</l>
     <l n="187">He clung , and cheer 'd the sadness of his soul ;</l>
     <l n="188">For though a man may not have much to fear ,</l>
     <l n="189">Yet death looks ugly when the view is near :</l>
     <l n="190">- ‘ I go , ’ he said , ‘ but still my friends shall say ,</l>
     <l n="191">‘ Twas as a man — I did not sneak away ;</l>
     <l n="192">An honest life with worthy souls I 've spent , -</l>
     <l n="193">Come , fill my glass ; ’ he took it and he went .</l>
     <l n="194">“ Poor Dolly Murray !— I might live to see</l>
     <l n="195">My hundredth year , but no such lass as she .</l>
     <l n="196">Easy by nature , in her humour gay ,</l>
     <l n="197">She chose her comforts , ratafia and play :</l>
     <l n="198">She loved the social game , the decent glass ,</l>
     <l n="199">And was a jovial , friendly , laughing lass ;</l>
     <l n="200">We sat not then at Whist demure and still ,</l>
     <l n="201">But pass 'd the pleasant hours at gay Quadrille :</l>
     <l n="202">Lame in her side , we plac 'd her in her seat ,</l>
     <l n="203">Her hands were free , she cared not for her feet ;</l>
     <l n="204">As the game ended , came the glass around</l>
     <l n="205">( So was the loser cheer 'd , the winner crown 'd ) .</l>
     <l n="206">Mistress of secrets , both the young and old</l>
     <l n="207">In her confided — not a tale she told ;</l>
     <l n="208">Love never made impression on her mind ,</l>
     <l n="209">She held him weak , and all his captives blind ;</l>
     <l n="210">She suffer 'd no man her free soul to vex ,</l>
     <l n="211">Free from the weakness of her gentle sex ;</l>
     <l n="212">One with whom ours unmoved conversing sate ,</l>
     <l n="213">In cool discussion or in free debate .</l>
     <l n="214">“ Once in her chair we 'd placed the good old lass ,</l>
     <l n="215">Where first she took her preparation-glass ;</l>
     <l n="216">By lucky thought she 'd been that day at prayers ,</l>
     <l n="217">And long before had fix 'd her small affairs ,</l>
     <l n="218">So all was easy — on her cards she cast</l>
     <l n="219">A smiling look ; I saw the thought that pass 'd :</l>
     <l n="220">‘ A king , ’ she call 'd — though conscious of her skill .</l>
     <l n="221">‘ Do more , ’ I answer 'd — ‘ More , ’ she said , ‘ I will ; ’</l>
     <l n="222">And more she did — cards answer 'd to her call ,</l>
     <l n="223">She saw the mighty to her mightier fall :</l>
     <l n="224">‘ A vole ! a vole ! ’ she cried , ‘'tis fairly won ,</l>
     <l n="225">My game is ended and my work is done ; ’ -</l>
     <l n="226">This said , she gently , with a single sigh ,</l>
     <l n="227">Died as one taught and practised how to die .</l>
     <l n="228">“ Such were the dead-departed ; I survive ,</l>
     <l n="229">To breathe in pain among the dead-alive . ”</l>
     <l n="230">The bell then call 'd these ancient men to pray ,</l>
     <l n="231">“ Again ! ” said Benbow ,— “ tolls it every day ?</l>
     <l n="232">Where is the life I led ? ” — He sigh 'd and walk 'd his way . { 7 }</l>

     <l n="9">‘ Tis not enough that we with sorrow sigh ,</l>
     <l n="10">That we the wants of pleading man supply ,</l>
     <l n="11">That we in sympathy with sufferers feel ,</l>

     <l n="35">He comes abroad and is himself again :</l>
     <l n="36">‘ Twas in the spring , when carried to the place ,</l>
     <l n="37">The snow fell down and melted in his face .</l>
     <l n="38">‘ Tis summer now ; all objects gay and new ,</l>
     <l n="39">Smiling alike the viewer and the view :</l>

     <l n="41">Without another and another glance ;</l>
     <l n="42">With what a pure and simple joy he sees</l>
     <l n="43">Those sheep and cattle browsing at their ease ;</l>
     <l n="44">Easy himself , there 's nothing breathes or moves ,</l>
     <l n="45">But he would cherish — all that lives he loves :</l>
     <l n="46">Observing every ward as round he goes ,</l>

     <l n="48">Warm in his wish for all who suffer there ,</l>
     <l n="49">At every view he meditates a prayer :</l>
     <l n="50">No evil counsels in his breast abide ,</l>
     <l n="51">There joy , and love , and gratitude reside .</l>
     <l n="52">The wish that Roman necks in one were found ,</l>
     <l n="53">That he who form 'd the wish might deal the wound ,</l>
     <l n="54">This man had never heard ; but of the kind ,</l>
     <l n="55">Is that desire which rises in his mind ;</l>
     <l n="56">He 'd have all English hands ( for further he</l>
     <l n="57">Cannot conceive extends our charity ) ,</l>
     <l n="58">All but his own , in one right-hand to grow ,</l>
     <l n="59">And then what hearty shake would he bestow .</l>
     <l n="60">“ How rose the Building ? ” — Piety first laid</l>
     <l n="61">A strong foundation , but she wanted aid ;</l>
     <l n="62">To Wealth unwieldy was her prayer address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="63">Who largely gave , and she the donor bless 'd :</l>
     <l n="64">Unwieldy Wealth then to his couch withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="65">And took the sweetest sleep he ever knew .</l>
     <l n="66">Then busy Vanity sustained her part ,</l>
     <l n="67">“ And much , ” she said , “ it moved her tender heart ;</l>
     <l n="68">To her all kinds of man 's distress were known ,</l>
     <l n="69">And all her heart adopted as its own . ”</l>
     <l n="70">Then Science came — his talents he display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="71">And Charity with joy the dome survey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="72">Skill , Wealth , and Vanity , obtain the fame ,</l>
     <l n="73">And Piety , the joy that makes no claim .</l>
     <l n="74">Patrons there are , and Governors , from , whom</l>
     <l n="75">The greater aid and guiding orders come ;</l>
     <l n="76">Who voluntary cares and labours take ,</l>
     <l n="77">The sufferers ’ servants for the service ’ sake ;</l>
     <l n="78">Of these a , part I give you — but a part , -</l>
     <l n="79">Some hearts are hidden , some have not a heart .</l>
     <l n="80">First let me praise — for so I best shall paint</l>
     <l n="81">That pious moralist , that reasoning saint !</l>
     <l n="82">Can I of worth like thine , Eusebius , speak ?</l>
     <l n="83">The man is willing , but the Muse is weak ; -</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Tis thine to wait on woe ! to soothe ! to heal !</l>
     <l n="85">With learning social , and polite with zeal :</l>
     <l n="86">In thy pure breast although the passions dwell ,</l>
     <l n="87">They 're train 'd by virtue , and no more rebel ;</l>
     <l n="88">But have so long been active on her side ,</l>
     <l n="89">That passion now might be itself the guide .</l>
     <l n="90">Law , conscience , honour , all obey 'd ; all give</l>
     <l n="91">Th ’ approving voice , and make it bliss to live ;</l>
     <l n="92">While faith , when life can nothing more supply ,</l>
     <l n="93">Shall strengthen hope , and make it bliss to die .</l>
     <l n="94">He preaches , speaks , and writes with manly sense ,</l>
     <l n="95">No weak neglect , no labour 'd eloquence ;</l>
     <l n="96">Goodness and wisdom are in all his ways ,</l>
     <l n="97">The rude revere him and the wicked praise .</l>
     <l n="98">Upon humility his virtues grow ,</l>
     <l n="99">And tower so high because so fix 'd below ;</l>
     <l n="100">As wider spreads the oak his boughs around ,</l>
     <l n="101">When deeper with his roots he digs the solid ground .</l>
     <l n="102">By him , from ward to ward , is every aid</l>
     <l n="103">The sufferer needs , with every care convey 'd :</l>
     <l n="104">Like the good tree he brings his treasure forth ,</l>
     <l n="105">And , like the tree , unconscious of his worth :</l>
     <l n="106">Meek as the poorest Publican is he ,</l>
     <l n="107">And strict as lives the straitest Pharisee ;</l>
     <l n="108">Of both , in him unite the better part ,</l>
     <l n="109">The blameless conduct and the humble heart .</l>
     <l n="110">Yet he escapes not ; he , with some , is wise</l>
     <l n="111">In carnal things , and loves to moralize :</l>
     <l n="112">Others can doubt if all that Christian care</l>
     <l n="113">Has not its price — there 's something he may share :</l>
     <l n="114">But this and ill severer he sustains ,</l>
     <l n="115">As gold the fire , and as unhurt remains ;</l>
     <l n="116">When most reviled , although he feels the smart ,</l>
     <l n="117">It wakes to nobler deeds the wounded heart ,</l>
     <l n="118">As the rich olive , beaten for its fruit ,</l>
     <l n="119">Puts forth at every bruise a bearing shoot .</l>
     <l n="120">A second friend we have , whose care and zeal</l>
     <l n="121">But few can equal — few indeed can feel ;</l>
     <l n="122">He lived a life obscure , and profits made</l>
     <l n="123">In the coarse habits of a vulgar trade .</l>
     <l n="124">His brother , master of a hoy , he loved</l>
     <l n="125">So well , that he the calling disapproved :</l>
     <l n="126">“ Alas ! poor Tom ! ” the landman oft would sigh</l>
     <l n="127">When the gale freshen 'd and the waves ran high ;</l>
     <l n="128">And when they parted , with a tear he 'd say ,</l>
     <l n="129">“ No more adventure !— here in safety stay . ”</l>
     <l n="130">Nor did he feign ; with more than half he had</l>
     <l n="131">He would have kept the seaman , and been glad .</l>
     <l n="132">Alas ! how few resist , when strongly tried -</l>
     <l n="133">A rich relation 's nearer kinsman died ;</l>
     <l n="134">He sicken 'd , and to him the landman went ,</l>
     <l n="135">And all his hours with cousin Ephraim spent .</l>
     <l n="136">This Thomas heard , and cared not : “ I , ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="137">“ Have one in port upon the watch for me . ”</l>
     <l n="138">So Ephraim died , and when the will was shown ,</l>
     <l n="139">Isaac , the landman , had the whole his own :</l>
     <l n="140">Who to his brother sent a moderate purse ,</l>
     <l n="141">Which he return 'd in anger , with his curse ;</l>
     <l n="142">Then went to sea , and made his grog so strong ,</l>
     <l n="143">He died before he could forgive the wrong .</l>
     <l n="144">The rich man built a house , both large and high ,</l>
     <l n="145">He enter 'd in and set him down to sigh ;</l>
     <l n="146">He planted ample woods and gardens fair ,</l>
     <l n="147">And walk 'd with anguish and compunction there :</l>
     <l n="148">The rich man 's pines , to every friend a treat ,</l>
     <l n="149">He saw with pain , and he refused to eat ;</l>
     <l n="150">His daintiest food , his richest wines , were all</l>
     <l n="151">Turn 'd by remorse to vinegar and gall :</l>
     <l n="152">The softest down by living body press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="153">The rich man bought , and tried to take his rest ;</l>
     <l n="154">But care had thorns upon his pillow spread ,</l>
     <l n="155">And scatter 'd sand and nettles in his bed :</l>
     <l n="156">Nervous he grew ,— would often sigh and groan ,</l>
     <l n="157">He talk 'd but little , and he walk 'd alone ;</l>
     <l n="158">Till by his priest convinced , that from one deed</l>
     <l n="159">Of genuine love would joy and health proceed ,</l>
     <l n="160">He from that time with care and zeal began</l>
     <l n="161">To seek and soothe the grievous ills of man ;</l>
     <l n="162">And as his hands their aid to grief apply ,</l>
     <l n="163">He learns to smile and he forgets to sigh .</l>
     <l n="164">Now he can drink his wine and taste his food ,</l>
     <l n="165">And feel the blessings Heav'n has dealt are good ;</l>
     <l n="166">And , since the suffering seek the rich man 's door ,</l>
     <l n="167">He sleeps as soundly as when young and poor .</l>
     <l n="168">Here much he gives — is urgent more to gain ;</l>
     <l n="169">He begs — rich beggars seldom sue in vain :</l>
     <l n="170">Preachers most famed he moves , the crowd to move ,</l>
     <l n="171">And never wearies in the work of love :</l>
     <l n="172">He rules all business , settles all affairs ;</l>
     <l n="173">He makes collections , he directs repairs ;</l>
     <l n="174">And if he wrong 'd one brother ,— Heav'n forgive</l>
     <l n="175">The man by whom so many brethren live .</l>

     <l n="176">Then , ‘ mid our Signatures , a name appears ,</l>
     <l n="177">Of one for wisdom famed above his years ;</l>
     <l n="178">And these were forty : he was from his youth</l>
     <l n="179">A patient searcher after useful truth :</l>
     <l n="180">To language little of his time he gave ,</l>
     <l n="181">To science less , nor was the Muse 's slave ;</l>
     <l n="182">Sober and grave , his college sent him down ,</l>
     <l n="183">A fair example for his native town .</l>
     <l n="184">Slowly he speaks , and with such solemn air ,</l>
     <l n="185">You 'd thing a Socrates or Solon there ;</l>
     <l n="186">For though a Christian , he 's disposed to draw</l>
     <l n="187">His rules from reason 's and from nature 's law .</l>
     <l n="188">“ Know , ” he exclaims , “ my fellow mortals , know ,</l>
     <l n="189">Virtue alone is happiness below ;</l>
     <l n="190">And what is virtue ? prudence first to choose</l>
     <l n="191">Life 's real good ,— the evil to refuse ;</l>
     <l n="192">Add justice then , the eager hand to hold ,</l>
     <l n="193">To curb the lust of power and thirst of gold ;</l>
     <l n="194">Join temp'rance next , that cheerful health ensures .</l>
     <l n="195">And fortitude unmoved , that conquers or endures . ”</l>
     <l n="196">He speaks , and lo !— the very man you see ,</l>
     <l n="197">Prudent and temperate , just and patient he ,</l>
     <l n="198">By prudence taught his worldly wealth to keep ,</l>
     <l n="199">No folly wastes , no avarice swells the heap :</l>
     <l n="200">He no man 's debtor , no man 's patron lives ;</l>
     <l n="201">Save sound advice , he neither asks nor gives ;</l>
     <l n="202">By no vain thoughts or erring fancy sway 'd ,</l>
     <l n="203">His words are weighty , or at least are weigh 'd ;</l>
     <l n="204">Temp'rate in every place — abroad , at home ,</l>
     <l n="205">Thence will applause , and hence will profit come</l>
     <l n="206">And health from either — he in time prepares</l>
     <l n="207">For sickness , age , and their attendant cares ,</l>
     <l n="208">But not for fancy 's ills ;— he never grieves</l>
     <l n="209">For love that wounds or friendship that deceives .</l>
     <l n="210">His patient soul endures what Heav'n ordains ,</l>
     <l n="211">But neither feels nor fears ideal pains .</l>
     <l n="212">“ Is aught then wanted in a man so wise ? ” -</l>
     <l n="213">Alas !— I think he wants infirmities ;</l>
     <l n="214">He wants the ties that knit us to our kind -</l>
     <l n="215">The cheerful , tender , soft , complacent mind .</l>
     <l n="216">That would the feelings , which he dreads , excite ,</l>
     <l n="217">And make the virtues he approves delight ;</l>
     <l n="218">What dying martyrs , saints , and patriots feel ,</l>
     <l n="219">The strength of action and the warmth of zeal .</l>
     <l n="220">Again attend !— and see a man whose cares</l>
     <l n="221">Are nicely placed on either world 's affairs , -</l>
     <l n="222">Merchant and saint ; ‘ tis doubtful if he knows</l>
     <l n="223">To which account he most regard bestows ;</l>
     <l n="224">Of both he keeps his ledger : — there he reads</l>
     <l n="225">Of gainful ventures and of godly deeds ;</l>
     <l n="226">There all he gets or loses find a place ,</l>
     <l n="227">A lucky bargain and a lack of grace .</l>
     <l n="228">The joys above this prudent man invite</l>
     <l n="229">To pay his tax — devotion !— day and night ;</l>
     <l n="230">The pains of hell his timid bosom awe ,</l>
     <l n="231">And force obedience to the church 's law :</l>
     <l n="232">Hence that continual thought ,— that solemn air ,</l>
     <l n="233">Those sad good works , and that laborious prayer .</l>
     <l n="234">All these ( when conscience , waken 'd and afraid ,</l>
     <l n="235">To think how avarice calls and is obey 'd )</l>
     <l n="236">He in his journal finds , and for his grief</l>
     <l n="237">Obtains the transient opium of relief .</l>
     <l n="238">“ Sink not , my soul !— my spirit , rise and look</l>
     <l n="239">O'er the fair entries of this precious book :</l>
     <l n="240">Here are the sins , our debts ;— this fairer side</l>
     <l n="241">Has what to carnal wish our strenetb denied ;</l>
     <l n="242">Has those religious duties every day</l>
     <l n="243">Paid ,— which so few upon the Sabbath pay ;</l>
     <l n="244">Here too are conquests over frail desires ,</l>
     <l n="245">Attendance due on all the church requires ;</l>
     <l n="246">Then alms I give — for I believe the word</l>
     <l n="247">Of holy writ , and lend unto the Lord ,</l>
     <l n="248">And if not all th ’ importunate demand ,</l>
     <l n="249">The fear of want restrains my ready hand :</l>
     <l n="250">- Behold ! what sums I to the poor resign ,</l>
     <l n="251">Sums placed in Heaven 's own book , as well as mine :</l>
     <l n="252">Rest then , my spirit !— fastings , prayers , and alms ,</l>
     <l n="253">Will soon suppress these idly-raised alarms ,</l>
     <l n="254">And weigh 'd against our frailties , set in view</l>
     <l n="255">A noble balance in our favour due :</l>
     <l n="256">Add that I yearly here affix my name ,</l>
     <l n="257">Pledge for large payment — not from love of fame ,</l>
     <l n="258">But to make peace within ;— that peace to make ,</l>
     <l n="259">“ What sums I lavish ! and what gains forsake !</l>
     <l n="260">Cheer up , my heart ! let 's cast off every doubt ,</l>
     <l n="261">Pray without dread , and place our money out . ”</l>
     <l n="262">Such the religion of a mind that steers</l>
     <l n="263">Its way to bliss , between its hopes and fears ;</l>
     <l n="264">Whose passions in due bounds each other keep ,</l>
     <l n="265">And thus subdued , they murmur till they sleep ;</l>
     <l n="266">Whose virtues all their certain limits know ,</l>
     <l n="267">Like well-dried herbs that neither fade nor grow ;</l>
     <l n="268">Who for success and safety ever tries ,</l>
     <l n="269">And with both worlds alternately complies .</l>
     <l n="270">Such are the Guardians of this bless 'd estate ,</l>
     <l n="271">Whate'er without , they 're praised within the gate ;</l>
     <l n="272">That they are men , and have their faults , is true ;</l>
     <l n="273">But here their worth alone appears in view :</l>
     <l n="274">The Muse indeed , who reads the very breast ,</l>
     <l n="275">Has something of the secrets there express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="276">But yet in charity ;— and when she sees</l>
     <l n="277">Such means for joy or comfort , health or ease ,</l>
     <l n="278">And knows how much united minds effect ,</l>
     <l n="279">She almost dreads their failings to detect ;</l>
     <l n="280">But Truth commands : — in man 's erroneous kind ,</l>
     <l n="281">Virtues and frailties mingle in the mind ,</l>
     <l n="282">Happy !— when fears to public spirit move ,</l>
     <l n="283">And even vices do the work of love . { 8 }</l>

     <l n="43">Shall I not grateful still the dame survey ,</l>
     <l n="44">And ask the Muse the poet 's debt to pay ?</l>
     <l n="45">Nor I alone , who hold a trifler 's pen ,</l>
     <l n="46">But half our bench of wealthy , weighty men ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who rule our Borough , who enforce our laws ;</l>
     <l n="48">They own the matron as the leading cause ,</l>
     <l n="49">And feel the pleasing debt , and pay the just applause :</l>
     <l n="50">To her own house is borne the week 's supply ;</l>
     <l n="51">There she in credit lives , there hopes in peace to die .</l>
     <l n="52">With her a harmless Idiot we behold ,</l>
     <l n="53">Who hoards up silver shells for shining gold :</l>
     <l n="54">These he preserves , with unremitted care ,</l>
     <l n="55">To buy a seat , and reign the Borough 's mayor :</l>
     <l n="56">Alas !— who could th ’ ambitious changeling tell ,</l>
     <l n="57">That what he sought our rulers dared to sell ?</l>
     <l n="58">Near these a Sailor , in that hut of thatch</l>
     <l n="59">( A fish-boat 's cabin is its nearest match ) ,</l>
     <l n="60">Dwells , and the dungeon is to him a seat ,</l>
     <l n="61">Large as he wishes — in his view complete :</l>
     <l n="62">A lockless coffer and a lidless hutch</l>
     <l n="63">That hold his stores , have room for twice as much :</l>
     <l n="64">His one spare shirt , long glass , and iron box ,</l>
     <l n="65">Lie all in view ; no need has he for locks :</l>
     <l n="66">Here he abides , and , as our strangers pass ,</l>
     <l n="67">He shows the shipping , he presents the glass ;</l>
     <l n="68">He makes ( unask 'd ) their ports and business known ,</l>
     <l n="69">And ( kindly heard ) turns quickly to his own ,</l>
     <l n="70">Of noble captains , heroes every one , -</l>
     <l n="71">You might as soon have made the steeple run ;</l>
     <l n="72">And then his messmates , if you 're pleased to stay ,</l>
     <l n="73">He 'll one by one the gallant souls display ,</l>
     <l n="74">And as the story verges to an end ,</l>
     <l n="75">He 'll wind from deed to deed , from friend to friend ;</l>
     <l n="76">He 'll speak of those long lost , the brave of old ,</l>
     <l n="77">As princes gen'rous and as heroes bold ;</l>
     <l n="78">Then will his feelings rise , till you may trace</l>
     <l n="79">Gloom , like a cloud , frown o'er his manly face , -</l>
     <l n="80">And then a tear or two , which sting his pride ;</l>
     <l n="81">These he will dash indignantly aside ,</l>
     <l n="82">And splice his tale ;— now take him from his cot ,</l>
     <l n="83">And for some cleaner berth exchange his lot ,</l>
     <l n="84">How will he all that cruel aid deplore ?</l>
     <l n="85">His heart will break , and he will fight no more .</l>
     <l n="86">Here is the poor old Merchant : he declined ,</l>
     <l n="87">And , as they say , is not in perfect mind ;</l>
     <l n="88">In his poor house , with one poor maiden friend ,</l>
     <l n="89">Quiet he paces to his journey 's end .</l>
     <l n="90">Rich in his youth , he traded and he fail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="91">Again he tried , again his fate prevail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="92">His spirits low , and his exertions small ,</l>
     <l n="93">He fell perforce , he seem 'd decreed to fall :</l>
     <l n="94">Like the gay knight , unapt to rise was he ,</l>
     <l n="95">But downward sank with sad alacrity .</l>
     <l n="96">A borough-place we gain 'd him — in disgrace</l>
     <l n="97">For gross neglect , he quickly lost the place ;</l>
     <l n="98">But still he kept a kind of sullen pride ,</l>
     <l n="99">Striving his wants to hinder or to hide ;</l>
     <l n="100">At length , compell 'd by very need , in grief</l>
     <l n="101">He wrote a proud petition for relief .</l>
     <l n="102">“ He did suppose a fall , like his , would prove</l>
     <l n="103">Of force to wake their sympathy and love ;</l>
     <l n="104">Would make them feel the changes all may know ,</l>
     <l n="105">And stir them up a due regard to show . ”</l>
     <l n="106">His suit was granted ;— to an ancient maid ,</l>
     <l n="107">Relieved herself , relief for him was paid :</l>
     <l n="108">Here they together ( meet companions ) dwell ,</l>
     <l n="109">And dismal tales of man 's misfortunes tell :</l>
     <l n="110">“ ‘ Twas not a world for them , God help them , they</l>
     <l n="111">Could not deceive , nor flatter , nor betray ;</l>
     <l n="112">But there 's a happy change , a scene to come ,</l>
     <l n="113">And they , God help them ! shall be soon at home . ”</l>
     <l n="114">If these no pleasures nor enjoyments gain ,</l>
     <l n="115">Still none their spirits nor their speech restrain ;</l>
     <l n="116">They sigh at ease , ‘ mid comforts they complain ,</l>
     <l n="117">The poor will grieve , the poor will weep and sigh ,</l>
     <l n="118">Both when they know , and when they know not why ;</l>
     <l n="119">But we our bounty with such care bestow ,</l>
     <l n="120">That cause for grieving they shall seldom know .</l>
     <l n="121">Your Plan I love not ; with a number you</l>
     <l n="122">Have placed your poor , your pitiable few :</l>
     <l n="123">There , in one house , throughout their lives to be ,</l>
     <l n="124">The pauper-palace which they hate to see :</l>
     <l n="125">That giant-building , that high-bounding wall ,</l>
     <l n="126">Those bare-worn walks , that lofty thund'ring hall ,</l>
     <l n="127">That large loud clock , which tolls each dreaded hour ,</l>
     <l n="128">Those gates and locks , and all those signs of power ;</l>
     <l n="129">It is a prison , with a milder name ,</l>
     <l n="130">Which few inhabit without dread or shame .</l>
     <l n="131">Be it agreed — the Poor who hither come</l>
     <l n="132">Partake of plenty , seldom found at home ;</l>
     <l n="133">That airy rooms and decent beds are meant</l>
     <l n="134">To give the poor by day , by night , content ;</l>
     <l n="135">That none are frighten 'd , once admitted here ,</l>
     <l n="136">By the stern looks of lordly Overseer :</l>
     <l n="137">Grant that the Guardians of the place attend ,</l>
     <l n="138">And ready ear to each petition lend ;</l>
     <l n="139">That they desire the grieving poor to show</l>
     <l n="140">What ills they feel , what partial acts they know ;</l>
     <l n="141">Not without promise , nay desire to heal</l>
     <l n="142">Each wrong they suffer , and each woe they feel .</l>
     <l n="143">Alas ! their sorrows in their bosoms dwell ;</l>
     <l n="144">They 've much to suffer , but have nought to tell ;</l>
     <l n="145">They have no evil in the place to state ,</l>
     <l n="146">And dare not say it is the house they hate :</l>
     <l n="147">They own there 's granted all such place can give ,</l>
     <l n="148">But live repining , for ‘ tis there they live .</l>
     <l n="149">Grandsires are there , who now no more must see ,</l>
     <l n="150">No more must nurse upon the trembling knee ,</l>
     <l n="151">The lost loved daughter 's infant progeny :</l>
     <l n="152">Like death 's dread mansion , this allows not place</l>
     <l n="153">For joyful meetings of a kindred race .</l>
     <l n="154">Is not the matron there , to whom the son</l>
     <l n="155">Was wont at each declining day to run ?</l>
     <l n="156">He ( when his toil was over ) gave delight ,</l>
     <l n="157">By lifting up the latch , and one “ Good night . ”</l>
     <l n="158">Yes , she is here ; but nightly to her door</l>
     <l n="159">The son , still lab'ring , can return no more .</l>
     <l n="160">Widows are here , who in their huts were left ,</l>
     <l n="161">Of husbands , children , plenty , ease bereft ;</l>
     <l n="162">Yet all that grief within the humble shed</l>
     <l n="163">Was soften 'd , softened in the humble bed :</l>
     <l n="164">But here , in all its force , remains the grief ,</l>
     <l n="165">And not one softening object for relief .</l>
     <l n="166">Who can , when here , the social neighbour meet ?</l>
     <l n="167">Who learn the story current in the street ?</l>
     <l n="168">Who to the long-known intimate impart</l>
     <l n="169">Facts they have learn 'd or feelings of the heart ?</l>
     <l n="170">They talk indeed , but who can choose a friend ,</l>
     <l n="171">Or seek companions at their journey 's end ?</l>
     <l n="172">Here are not those whom they when infants knew ;</l>
     <l n="173">Who , with like fortune , up to manhood grew ;</l>
     <l n="174">Who , with like troubles , at old age arrived ;</l>
     <l n="175">Who , like themselves , the joy of life survived ;</l>
     <l n="176">Whom time and custom so familiar made ,</l>
     <l n="177">That looks the meaning in the mind convey 'd :</l>
     <l n="178">But here to strangers , words nor looks impart</l>
     <l n="179">The various movements of the suffering heart ;</l>
     <l n="180">Nor will that heart with those alliance own ,</l>
     <l n="181">To whom its views and hopes are all unknown .</l>
     <l n="182">What , if no grievous fears their lives annoy ,</l>
     <l n="183">Is it not worse no prospects to enjoy ?</l>
     <l n="184">‘ Tis cheerless living in such bounded view ,</l>
     <l n="185">With nothing dreadful , but with nothing new ;</l>
     <l n="186">Nothing to bring them joy , to make them weep , -</l>
     <l n="187">The day itself is , like the night , asleep ;</l>
     <l n="188">Or on the sameness if a break be made ,</l>
     <l n="189">‘ Tis by some pauper to his grave convey 'd ;</l>
     <l n="190">By smuggled news from neighb'ring village told ,</l>
     <l n="191">News never true , or truth a twelvemonth old ;</l>
     <l n="192">By some new inmate doom 'd with them to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="193">Or justice come to see that all goes well ;</l>
     <l n="194">Or change of room , or hour of leave to crawl</l>
     <l n="195">On the black footway winding with the wall ,</l>
     <l n="196">Till the stern bell forbids , or master 's sterner call .</l>
     <l n="197">Here too the mother sees her children train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="198">Her voice excluded and her feelings pain 'd :</l>
     <l n="199">Who govern here , by general rules must move ,</l>
     <l n="200">Where ruthless custom rends the bond of love .</l>
     <l n="201">Nations we know have nature 's law transgress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="202">And snatch 'd the infant from the parent 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="203">But still for public good the boy was train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="204">The mother suffer 'd , but the matron gain 'd :</l>
     <l n="205">Here nature 's outrage serves no cause to aid ;</l>
     <l n="206">The ill is felt , but not the Spartan made .</l>
     <l n="207">Then too I own , it grieves me to behold</l>
     <l n="208">Those ever virtuous , helpless now and old ,</l>
     <l n="209">By all for care and industry approved ,</l>
     <l n="210">For truth respected , and for temper loved ;</l>
     <l n="211">And who , by sickness and misfortune tried ,</l>
     <l n="212">Gave want its worth and poverty its pride :</l>
     <l n="213">I own it grieves me to behold them sent</l>
     <l n="214">From their old home ; ‘ tis pain , ‘ tis punishment ,</l>
     <l n="215">To leave each scene familiar , every face ,</l>
     <l n="216">For a new people and a stranger race ;</l>
     <l n="217">For those who , sunk in sloth and dead to shame ,</l>
     <l n="218">From scenes of guilt with daring spirits came ;</l>
     <l n="219">Men , just and guileless , at such manners start ,</l>
     <l n="220">And bless their God that time has fenced their heart ,</l>
     <l n="221">Confirm 'd their virtue , and expell 'd the fear</l>
     <l n="222">Of vice in minds so simple and sincere .</l>
     <l n="223">Here the good pauper , losing all the praise</l>
     <l n="224">By worthy deeds acquired in better days ,</l>
     <l n="225">Breathes a few months , then , to his chamber led ,</l>
     <l n="226">Expires , while strangers prattle round his bed .</l>
     <l n="227">The grateful hunter , when his horse is old ,</l>
     <l n="228">Wills not the useless favourite to be sold ;</l>
     <l n="229">He knows his former worth , and gives him place</l>
     <l n="230">In some fair pasture , till he runs his race :</l>
     <l n="231">But has the labourer , has the seaman done</l>
     <l n="232">Less worthy service , though not dealt to one ?</l>
     <l n="233">Shall we not then contribute to their ease ,</l>
     <l n="234">In their old haunts , where ancient objects please ?</l>
     <l n="235">That , till their sight shall fail them , they may trace</l>
     <l n="236">The well-known prospect and the long-loved face .</l>
     <l n="237">The noble oak , in distant ages seen ,</l>
     <l n="238">With far-stretch 'd boughs and foliage fresh and green ,</l>
     <l n="239">Though now its bare and forky branches show</l>
     <l n="240">How much it lacks the vital warmth below ,</l>
     <l n="241">The stately ruin yet our wonder gains ,</l>
     <l n="242">Nay , moves our pity , without thought of pains :</l>
     <l n="243">Much more shall real wants and cares of age</l>
     <l n="244">Our gentler passions in their cause engage ; -</l>
     <l n="245">Drooping and burthen 'd with a weight of years ,</l>
     <l n="246">What venerable ruin man appears !</l>
     <l n="247">How worthy pity , love , respect , and grief -</l>
     <l n="248">He claims protection — he compels relief ; -</l>
     <l n="249">And shall we send him from our view , to brave</l>
     <l n="250">The storms abroad , whom we at home might save ,</l>
     <l n="251">And let a stranger dig our ancient brother 's grave ?</l>
     <l n="252">No ! we will shield him from the storm he fears ,</l>
     <l n="253">And when he falls , embalm him with our tears .</l>

     <l n="254">Farewell to these : but all our poor to know ,</l>
     <l n="255">Let 's seek the winding Lane , the narrow Row ,</l>
     <l n="256">Suburban prospects , where the traveller stops</l>
     <l n="257">To see the sloping tenement on props ,</l>
     <l n="258">With building-yards immix 'd , and humble sheds and shops ;</l>
     <l n="259">Where the Cross-Keys and Plumber'shYpppHeNArms invite</l>
     <l n="260">Laborious men to taste their coarse delight ;</l>
     <l n="261">Where the low porches , stretching from the door ,</l>
     <l n="262">Gave some distinction in the days of yore ,</l>
     <l n="263">Yet now neglected , more offend the eye ,</l>
     <l n="264">By gloom and ruin , than the cottage by :</l>
     <l n="265">Places like these the noblest town endures ,</l>
     <l n="266">The gayest palace has its sinks and sewers .</l>

     <l n="275">Lo ! yonder shed ; observe its garden-ground ,</l>
     <l n="276">With the low paling , form 'd of wreck , around :</l>

     <l n="289">That coal-dust flies along the blinding blast :</l>
     <l n="290">None heed the stagnant pools on either side ,</l>
     <l n="291">Where new-launch 'd ships of infant-sailors ride :</l>
     <l n="292">Rodneys in rags here British valour boast ,</l>
     <l n="293">And lisping Nelsons fright the Gallic coast .</l>
     <l n="294">They fix the rudder , set the swelling sail ,</l>
     <l n="295">They point the bowsprit , and they blow the gale :</l>
     <l n="296">True to her port , the frigate scuds away ,</l>
     <l n="297">And o'er that frowning ocean finds her bay :</l>
     <l n="298">Her owner rigg 'd her , and he knows her worth ,</l>

     <l n="325">All in the stifling fervour of the day .</l>
     <l n="326">Her naked children round the alley run ,</l>
     <l n="327">And roll 'd in dust , are bronzed beneath the sun ,</l>
     <l n="328">Or gambol round the dame , who , loosely dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="329">Woos the coy breeze to fan the open breast :</l>
     <l n="330">She , once a handmaid , strove by decent art</l>

     <l n="337">No rival beauty kept alive her pride :</l>
     <l n="338">Still in her bosom virtue keeps her place ,</l>
     <l n="339">But decency is gone , the virtues ’ guard and grace .</l>
     <l n="340">See that long boarded Building !— By these stairs</l>
     <l n="341">Each humble tenant to that home repairs -</l>
     <l n="342">By one large window lighted — it was made</l>
     <l n="343">For some bold project , some design in trade :</l>
     <l n="344">This fail 'd ,— and one , a humourist in his way ,</l>
     <l n="345">( Ill was the humour ) , bought it in decay ;</l>
     <l n="346">Nor will he sell , repair , or take it down ;</l>
     <l n="347">‘ Tis his ,— what cares he for the talk of town ?</l>
     <l n="348">“ No ! he will let it to the poor ;— a home</l>
     <l n="349">Where he delights to see the creatures come : ”</l>
     <l n="350">“ They may be thieves ; ” — “ Well , so are richer men ; ”</l>
     <l n="351">“ Or idlers , cheats , or prostitutes ; ” — “ What then ? ”</l>
     <l n="352">“ Outcasts pursued by justice , vile and base ; ” -</l>
     <l n="353">“ They need the more his pity and the place : ”</l>
     <l n="354">Convert to system his vain mind has built ,</l>
     <l n="355">He gives asylum to deceit and guilt .</l>
     <l n="356">In this vast room , each place by habit fix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="357">Are sexes , families , and ages mix 'd -</l>
     <l n="358">To union forced by crime , by fear , by need ,</l>
     <l n="359">And all in morals and in modes agreed ;</l>
     <l n="360">Some ruin 'd men , who from mankind remove ;</l>
     <l n="361">Some ruin 'd females , who yet talk of love ;</l>
     <l n="362">And some grown old in idleness — the prey</l>
     <l n="363">To vicious spleen , still railing through the day ;</l>
     <l n="364">And need and misery , vice and danger bind ,</l>
     <l n="365">In sad alliance each degraded mind .</l>
     <l n="366">That window view !— oil 'd paper and old glass</l>
     <l n="367">Stain the strong rays , which , though impeded , pass ,</l>
     <l n="368">And give a dusty warmth to that huge room ,</l>
     <l n="369">The conquer 'd sunshine 's melancholy gloom ;</l>
     <l n="370">When all those western rays , without so bright ,</l>
     <l n="371">Within become a ghastly glimmering light ,</l>
     <l n="372">As pale and faint upon the floor they fall ,</l>
     <l n="373">Or feebly gleam on the opposing wall :</l>
     <l n="374">That floor , once oak , now pieced with fir unplaned ,</l>
     <l n="375">Or , where not pieced , in places bored and stain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="376">That wall once whiten 'd , now an odious sight ,</l>
     <l n="377">Stain 'd with all hues , except its ancient white ;</l>
     <l n="378">The only door is fasten 'd by a pin ,</l>
     <l n="379">Or stubborn bar that none may hurry in :</l>
     <l n="380">For this poor room , like rooms of greater pride ,</l>
     <l n="381">At times contains what prudent men would hide .</l>
     <l n="382">Where'er the floor allows an even space ,</l>
     <l n="383">Chalking and marks of various games have place ;</l>
     <l n="384">Boys , without foresight , pleased in halters swing ;</l>
     <l n="385">On a fix 'd hook men cast a flying ring ;</l>
     <l n="386">While gin and snuff their female neighbours share ,</l>
     <l n="387">And the black beverage in the fractured ware .</l>
     <l n="388">On swinging shelf are things incongruous stored , -</l>
     <l n="389">Scraps of their food ,— the cards and cribbage-board , -</l>
     <l n="390">With pipes and pouches ; while on peg below ,</l>
     <l n="391">Hang a lost member 's fiddle and its bow ;</l>
     <l n="392">That still reminds them how he 'd dance and play ,</l>
     <l n="393">Ere sent untimely to the Convicts ’ Bay .</l>
     <l n="394">Here by a curtain , by a blanket there ,</l>
     <l n="395">Are various beds conceal 'd , but none with care ;</l>
     <l n="396">Where some by day and some by night , as best</l>
     <l n="397">Suit their employments , seek uncertain rest ;</l>
     <l n="398">The drowsy children at their pleasure creep</l>
     <l n="399">To the known crib , and there securely sleep .</l>
     <l n="400">Each end contains a grate , and these beside</l>
     <l n="401">Are hung utensils for their boil 'd and fried -</l>
     <l n="402">All used at any hour , by night , by day ,</l>
     <l n="403">As suit the purse , the person , or the prey .</l>
     <l n="404">Above the fire , the mantel-shelf contains</l>
     <l n="405">Of china-ware some poor unmatched remains ;</l>
     <l n="406">There many a tea-cup 's gaudy fragment stands ,</l>
     <l n="407">All placed by vanity 's unwearied hands ;</l>
     <l n="408">For here she lives , e'en here she looks about ,</l>
     <l n="409">To find some small consoling objects out :</l>
     <l n="410">Nor heed these Spartan dames their house , not sit</l>
     <l n="411">‘ Mid cares domestic ,— they nor sew nor knit ;</l>
     <l n="412">But of their fate discourse , their ways , their wars ,</l>
     <l n="413">With arm 'd authorities , their ‘ scapes and scars :</l>
     <l n="414">These lead to present evils , and a cup ,</l>
     <l n="415">If fortune grant it , winds description up .</l>
     <l n="416">High hung at either end , and next the wall ,</l>
     <l n="417">Two ancient mirrors show the forms of all ,</l>
     <l n="418">In all their force ;— these aid them in their dress ,</l>
     <l n="419">But with the good , the evils too express ,</l>
     <l n="420">Doubling each look of care , each token of distress .</l>

    <head>THE PARISH-CLERK .</head>
    <head>The Parish-Clerk began his Duties with the late Vicar , a grave and austere Man ; one fully orthodox ; a Detecter and Opposer of the Wiles of Satan — His opinion of his own Fortitude — The more frail offended by these Professions — His good advice gives further Provocation — They invent stratagems to overcome his Virtue — His Triumph — He is yet not invulnerable : is assaulted by fear of Want , and Avarice — He gradually yields to the Seduction — He reasons with himself , and is persuaded — He offends , but with Terror ; repeats his Offence ; grows familiar with Crime : is detected — His Sufferings and Death .</head>
     <l n="1">WITH our late Vicar , and his age the same ,</l>
     <l n="2">His clerk , hight Jachin , to his office came ;</l>
     <l n="3">The like slow speech was his , the like tall slender frame :</l>
     <l n="4">But Jachin was the gravest man on ground ,</l>
     <l n="5">And heard his master 's jokes with look profound ;</l>
     <l n="6">For worldly wealth this man of letters sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="7">And had a sprinkling of the spirit 's pride :</l>
     <l n="8">But he was sober , chaste , devout and just ,</l>
     <l n="9">One whom his neighbours could believe and trust :</l>
     <l n="10">Of none suspected , neither man nor maid</l>
     <l n="11">By him were wrong 'd , or were of him afraid .</l>
     <l n="12">There was indeed a frown , a trick of state</l>
     <l n="13">In Jachin ;— formal was his air and gait :</l>
     <l n="14">But if he seem 'd more solemn and less kind ,</l>
     <l n="15">Than some light men to light affairs confined ,</l>
     <l n="16">Still ‘ twas allow 'd that he should so behave</l>
     <l n="17">As in high seat , and be severely grave .</l>
     <l n="18">This book-taught man , to man 's first foe profess 'd</l>
     <l n="19">Defiance stern , and hate that knew not rest ;</l>
     <l n="20">He held that Satan , since the world began ,</l>
     <l n="21">In every act , had strife with every man ;</l>
     <l n="22">That never evil deed on earth was done ,</l>
     <l n="23">But of the acting parties he was one ;</l>
     <l n="24">The flattering guide to make ill prospects clear ;</l>
     <l n="25">To smooth rough ways the constant pioneer ;</l>
     <l n="26">The ever-tempting , soothing , softening power ,</l>
     <l n="27">Ready to cheat , seduce , deceive , devour .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Me has the sly Seducer oft withstood , ”</l>
     <l n="29">Said pious Jachin ,— “ but he gets no good ;</l>
     <l n="30">I pass the house where swings the tempting sign ,</l>
     <l n="31">And pointing , tell him , ‘ Satan , that is thine : ’</l>
     <l n="32">I pass the damsels pacing down the street ,</l>
     <l n="33">And look more grave and solemn when we meet ;</l>
     <l n="34">Nor doth it irk me to rebuke their smiles ,</l>
     <l n="35">Their wanton ambling and their watchful wiles :</l>
     <l n="36">Nay , like the good John Bunyan , when I view</l>
     <l n="37">Those forms , I 'm angry at the ills they do ;</l>
     <l n="38">That I could pinch and spoil , in sin 's despite ,</l>
     <l n="39">Beauties , which frail and evil thoughts excite . { 10 }</l>
     <l n="40">“ At feasts and banquets seldom am I found ,</l>
     <l n="41">And ( save at church ) abhor a tuneful sound ;</l>
     <l n="42">To plays and shows I run not to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="43">And where my master goes , forbear to go . ”</l>
     <l n="44">No wonder Satan took the thing amiss ,</l>
     <l n="45">To be opposed by such a man as this -</l>
     <l n="46">A man so grave , important , cautious , wise ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who dared not trust his feeling or his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="48">No wonder he should lurk and lie in wait ,</l>
     <l n="49">Should fit his hooks and ponder on his bait ;</l>
     <l n="50">Should on his movements keep a watchful eye ;</l>
     <l n="51">For he pursued a fish who led the fry .</l>
     <l n="52">With his own peace our Clerk was not content ;</l>
     <l n="53">He tried , good man ! to make his friends repent .</l>
     <l n="54">“ Nay , nay , my friends , from inns and taverns fly ;</l>
     <l n="55">You may suppress your thirst , but not supply :</l>
     <l n="56">A foolish proverb says , ‘ the devil 's at home ; ’</l>
     <l n="57">But he is there , and tempts in every room :</l>
     <l n="58">Men feel , they know not why , such places please ;</l>
     <l n="59">His are the spells — they 're idleness and ease ;</l>
     <l n="60">Magic of fatal kind he throws around ,</l>
     <l n="61">Where care is banish 'd , but the heart is bound .</l>
     <l n="62">“ Think not of beauty ;— when a maid you meet ,</l>
     <l n="63">Turn from her view and step across the street ;</l>
     <l n="64">Dread all the sex : their looks create a charm ,</l>
     <l n="65">A smile should fright you and a word alarm :</l>
     <l n="66">E'en I myself , with all my watchful care ,</l>
     <l n="67">Have for an instant felt the insidious snare ;</l>
     <l n="68">And caught my sinful eyes at the endang'ring stars ;</l>
     <l n="69">Till I was forced to smite my bounding breast</l>
     <l n="70">With forceful blow , and bid the bold-one rest .</l>
     <l n="71">“ Go not with crowds when they to pleasure run ,</l>
     <l n="72">But public joy in private safety shun :</l>
     <l n="73">When bells , diverted from their true intent ,</l>
     <l n="74">Ring loud for some deluded mortal sent</l>
     <l n="75">To hear or make long speech in parliament ;</l>
     <l n="76">What time the many , that unruly beast ,</l>
     <l n="77">Roars its rough joy and shares the final feast ?</l>
     <l n="78">Then heed my counsel , shut thine ears and eyes ;</l>
     <l n="79">A few will hear me — for the few are wise . ”</l>
     <l n="80">Not Satan 's friends , nor Satan 's self could bear ,</l>
     <l n="81">The cautious man who took of souls such care ;</l>
     <l n="82">An interloper ,— one who , out of place ,</l>
     <l n="83">Had volunteered upon the side of grace :</l>
     <l n="84">There was his master ready once a week</l>
     <l n="85">To give advice ; what further need he seek ?</l>
     <l n="86">“ Amen , so be it : ” — what had he to do</l>
     <l n="87">With more than this ?— ‘ twas insolent and new ;</l>
     <l n="88">And some determined on a way to see</l>
     <l n="89">How frail he was , that so it might not be .</l>
     <l n="90">First they essay 'd to tempt our saint to sin ,</l>
     <l n="91">By points of doctrine argued at an inn ;</l>
     <l n="92">Where he might warmly reason , deeply drink ,</l>
     <l n="93">Then lose all power to argue and to think .</l>
     <l n="94">In vain they tried ; he took the question up ,</l>
     <l n="95">Clear 'd every doubt , and barely touch 'd the cup :</l>
     <l n="96">By many a text he proved his doctrine sound ,</l>
     <l n="97">And look 'd in triumph on the tempters round .</l>
     <l n="98">Next ‘ twas their care an artful lass to find ,</l>
     <l n="99">Who might consult him , as perplex 'd in mind ;</l>
     <l n="100">She they conceived might put her case with fears ,</l>
     <l n="101">With tender tremblings and seducing tears ;</l>
     <l n="102">She might such charms of various kind display ,</l>
     <l n="103">That he would feel their force and melt away :</l>
     <l n="104">For why of nymphs such caution and such dread ,</l>
     <l n="105">Unless he felt , and fear 'd to be misled ?</l>
     <l n="106">She came , she spake : he calmly heard her case ,</l>
     <l n="107">And plainly told her ‘ twas a want of grace ;</l>
     <l n="108">Bade her “ such fancies and affections check ,</l>
     <l n="109">And wear a thicker muslin on her neck . ”</l>
     <l n="110">Abased , his human foes the combat fled ,</l>
     <l n="111">And the stern clerk yet higher held his head .</l>
     <l n="112">They were indeed a weak , impatient set ,</l>
     <l n="113">But their shrewd prompter had his engines yet ;</l>
     <l n="114">Had various means to make a mortal trip ,</l>
     <l n="115">Who shunn 'd a flowing bowl and rosy lip ;</l>
     <l n="116">And knew a thousand ways his heart to move ,</l>
     <l n="117">Who flies from banquets and who laughs at love .</l>
     <l n="118">Thus far the playful Muse has lent her aid ,</l>
     <l n="119">But now departs , of graver theme afraid ;</l>
     <l n="120">Her may we seek in more appropriate time , -</l>
     <l n="121">There is no jesting with distress and crime .</l>
     <l n="122">Our worthy Clerk had now arrived at fame ,</l>
     <l n="123">Such as but few in his degree might claim ;</l>
     <l n="124">But he was poor , and wanted not the sense</l>
     <l n="125">That lowly rates the praise without the pence :</l>
     <l n="126">He saw the common herd with reverence treat</l>
     <l n="127">The weakest burgess whom they chanced to meet ;</l>
     <l n="128">While few respected his exalted views ,</l>
     <l n="129">And all beheld his doublet and his shoes :</l>
     <l n="130">None , when they meet , would to his parts allow</l>
     <l n="131">( Save his poor boys ) a hearing or a bow :</l>
     <l n="132">To this false judgment of the vulgar mind ,</l>
     <l n="133">He was not fully , as a saint , resign 'd ;</l>
     <l n="134">He found it much his jealous soul affect ,</l>
     <l n="135">To fear derision and to find neglect .</l>
     <l n="136">The year was bad , the christening-fees were small ,</l>
     <l n="137">The weddings few , the parties paupers all :</l>
     <l n="138">Desire of gain with fear of want combined ,</l>
     <l n="139">Raised sad commotion in his wounded mind ;</l>
     <l n="140">Wealth was in all his thoughts , his views , his dreams ,</l>
     <l n="141">And prompted base desires and baseless schemes .</l>
     <l n="142">Alas ! how often erring mortals keep</l>
     <l n="143">The strongest watch against the foes who sleep ;</l>
     <l n="144">While the more wakeful , bold , and artful foe</l>
     <l n="145">Is suffer 'd guardless and unmark 'd to go .</l>
     <l n="146">Once in a month the sacramental bread</l>
     <l n="147">Our Clerk with wine upon the table spread :</l>
     <l n="148">The custom this , that as the vicar reads ,</l>
     <l n="149">He for our off'rings round the church proceeds ;</l>
     <l n="150">Tall spacious seats the wealthier people hid ,</l>
     <l n="151">And none had view of what his neighbour did :</l>
     <l n="152">Laid on the box and mingled when they fell ,</l>
     <l n="153">Who should the worth of each oblation tell ?</l>
     <l n="154">Now as poor Jachin took the usual round ,</l>
     <l n="155">And saw the alms and heard the metal sound ,</l>
     <l n="156">He had a thought — at first it was no more</l>
     <l n="157">Than — “ these have cash and give it to the poor . ”</l>
     <l n="158">A second thought from this to work began -</l>
     <l n="159">“ And can they give it to a poorer man ? ”</l>
     <l n="160">Proceeding thus ,— “ My merit could they know ;</l>
     <l n="161">And knew my need , how freely they 'd bestow ;</l>
     <l n="162">But though they know not , these remain the same ,</l>
     <l n="163">And are a strong , although a secret claim :</l>
     <l n="164">To me , alas ! the want and worth are known ;</l>
     <l n="165">Why then , in fact , ‘ tis but to take my own . ”</l>
     <l n="166">Thought after thought pour 'd in , a tempting train : -</l>
     <l n="167">“ Suppose it done ,— who is it could complain ?</l>
     <l n="168">How could the poor ? for they such trifles share ,</l>
     <l n="169">As add no comfort , as suppress no care ;</l>
     <l n="170">But many a pittance makes a worthy heap , -</l>
     <l n="171">What says the law ? that silence puts to sleep : -</l>
     <l n="172">Nought then forbids , the danger could we shun ,</l>
     <l n="173">And sure the business may be safely done .</l>
     <l n="174">“ But am I earnest ?— earnest ? No .— I say ,</l>
     <l n="175">If such my mind , that I could plan a way ;</l>
     <l n="176">Let me reflect ;— I 've not allow 'd me time</l>
     <l n="177">To purse the pieces , and if dropp 'd they 'd chime : ”</l>
     <l n="178">Fertile is evil in the soul of man . -</l>
     <l n="179">He paused ,— said Jachin , “ They may drop on bran .</l>
     <l n="180">Why then ‘ tis safe and ( all consider 'd ) just ,</l>
     <l n="181">The poor receive it ,— ‘ tis no breach of trust :</l>
     <l n="182">The old and widows may their trifles miss ,</l>
     <l n="183">There must be evil in a good like this :</l>
     <l n="184">But I 'll be kind — the sick I 'll visit twice ,</l>
     <l n="185">When now but once , and freely give advice .</l>
     <l n="186">Yet let me think again : ” — Again he tried ,</l>
     <l n="187">For stronger reasons on his passion 's side ,</l>
     <l n="188">And quickly these were found , yet slowly he complied .</l>
     <l n="189">The morning came : the common service done ,</l>
     <l n="190">Shut every door ,— the solemn rite begun , -</l>
     <l n="191">And , as the priest the sacred sayings read ,</l>
     <l n="192">The clerk went forward , trembling as he tread :</l>
     <l n="193">O'er the tall pew he held the box , and heard</l>
     <l n="194">The offer 'd piece , rejoicing as he fear 'd :</l>
     <l n="195">Just by the pillar , as he cautious tripp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="196">And turn 'd the aisle , he then a portion slipp 'd</l>
     <l n="197">From the full store , and to the pocket sent ,</l>
     <l n="198">But held a moment — and then down it went .</l>
     <l n="199">The priest read on , on walk 'd the man afraid ,</l>
     <l n="200">Till a gold offering in the plate was laid :</l>
     <l n="201">Trembling he took it , for a moment stopp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="202">Then down it fell , and sounded as it dropp 'd ;</l>
     <l n="203">Amazed he started , for th ’ affrighted man ,</l>
     <l n="204">Lost and bewilder 'd , thought not of the bran .</l>
     <l n="205">But all were silent , all on things intent</l>
     <l n="206">Of high concern , none ear to money lent ;</l>
     <l n="207">So on he walk 'd , more cautious than before ,</l>
     <l n="208">And gain 'd the purposed sum and one piece more .</l>
     <l n="209">“ Practice makes perfect : ” when the month came round ,</l>
     <l n="210">He dropp 'd the cash , nor listen 'd for a sound :</l>
     <l n="211">But yet , when last of all th ’ assembled flock</l>
     <l n="212">He ate and drank ,— it gave th ’ electric shock :</l>
     <l n="213">Oft was he forced his reasons to repeat ,</l>
     <l n="214">Ere he could kneel in quiet at his seat ;</l>
     <l n="215">But custom soothed him — ere a single year</l>
     <l n="216">All this was done without restraint or fear :</l>
     <l n="217">Cool and collected , easy and composed ,</l>
     <l n="218">He was correct till all the service closed ;</l>
     <l n="219">Then to his home , without a groan or sigh ,</l>
     <l n="220">Gravely he went , and laid his treasure by .</l>
     <l n="221">Want will complain : some widows had express 'd</l>
     <l n="222">A doubt if they were favour 'd like the rest ;</l>
     <l n="223">The rest described with like regret their dole ,</l>
     <l n="224">And thus from parts they reason 'd to the whole :</l>
     <l n="225">When all agreed some evil must be done ,</l>
     <l n="226">Or rich men 's hearts grew harder than a stone .</l>
     <l n="227">Our easy vicar cut the matter short ;</l>
     <l n="228">He would not listen to such vile report .</l>
     <l n="229">All were not thus — there govern 'd in that year</l>
     <l n="230">A stern stout churl , an angry overseer ;</l>
     <l n="231">A tyrant fond of power , loud , lewd , and most severe :</l>
     <l n="232">Him the mild vicar , him the graver clerk ,</l>
     <l n="233">Advised , reproved , but nothing would he mark .</l>
     <l n="234">Save the disgrace ; “ and that , my friends , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="235">“ Will I avenge , whenever time may be . ”</l>
     <l n="236">And now , alas ! ‘ twas time : — from man to man</l>
     <l n="237">Doubt and alarm and shrewd suspicions ran .</l>
     <l n="238">With angry spirit and with sly intent ,</l>
     <l n="239">This parish-ruler to the altar went :</l>
     <l n="240">A private mark he fix 'd on shillings three ,</l>
     <l n="241">And but one mark could in the money see :</l>
     <l n="242">Besides in peering round , he chanced to note</l>
     <l n="243">A sprinkling slight on Jachin 's Sunday-coat :</l>
     <l n="244">All doubt was over : — when the flock were bless 'd ,</l>
     <l n="245">In wrath he rose , and thus his mind express 'd : -</l>
     <l n="246">“ Foul deeds are here ! ” and saying this , he took</l>
     <l n="247">The Clerk , whose conscience , in her cold-fit , shook :</l>
     <l n="248">His pocket then was emptied on the place ;</l>
     <l n="249">All saw his guilt ; all witness 'd his disgrace :</l>
     <l n="250">He fell , he fainted , not a groan , a look ,</l>
     <l n="251">Escaped the culprit ; ‘ twas a final stroke -</l>
     <l n="252">A death-wound never to be heal 'd — a fall</l>
     <l n="253">That all had witness 'd , and amazed were all .</l>
     <l n="254">As he recover 'd , to his mind it came ,</l>
     <l n="255">“ I owe to Satan this disgrace and shame : ”</l>
     <l n="256">All the seduction now appear 'd in view ;</l>
     <l n="257">“ Let me withdraw , ” he said , and he withdrew :</l>
     <l n="258">No one withheld him , all in union cried ,</l>
     <l n="259">E'en the avenger ,— “ We are satisfied : ”</l>
     <l n="260">For what has death in any form to give ,</l>
     <l n="261">Equal to that man 's terrors , if he live ?</l>
     <l n="262">He lived in freedom , but he hourly saw</l>
     <l n="263">How much more fatal justice is than law ;</l>
     <l n="264">He saw another in his office reign ,</l>
     <l n="265">And his mild master treat him with disdain :</l>
     <l n="266">He saw that all men shunn 'd him , some reviled ,</l>
     <l n="267">The harsh pass 'd frowning , and the simple smiled ;</l>
     <l n="268">The town maintain 'd him , but with some reproof ,</l>
     <l n="269">And clerks and scholars proudly kept aloof .</l>
     <l n="270">In each lone place , dejected and dismay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="271">Shrinking from view , his wasting form he laid ;</l>
     <l n="272">Or to the restless sea and roaring wind</l>
     <l n="273">Gave the strong yearnings of a ruin 'd mind :</l>
     <l n="274">On the broad beach , the silent summer-day ,</l>
     <l n="275">Stretch 'd on some wreck , he wore his life away ;</l>
     <l n="276">Or where the river mingles with the sea ,</l>
     <l n="277">Or on the mud-bank by the elder tree ,</l>
     <l n="278">Or by the bounding marsh-dike , there was he :</l>
     <l n="279">And when unable to forsake the town ,</l>
     <l n="280">In the blind courts he sat desponding down -</l>
     <l n="281">Always alone : then feebly would he crawl</l>
     <l n="282">The church-way walk , and lean upon the wall :</l>
     <l n="283">Too ill for this , he lay beside the door ,</l>
     <l n="284">Compell 'd to hear the reasoning of the poor :</l>
     <l n="285">He look 'd so pale , so weak , the pitying crowd</l>
     <l n="286">Their firm belief of his repentance vow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="287">They saw him then so ghastly and so thin ,</l>
     <l n="288">That they exclaim 'd , “ Is this the work of sin ? ”</l>
     <l n="289">“ Yes , ” in his better moments , he replied ,</l>
     <l n="290">“ Of sinful avarice and the spirit 's pride ; -</l>
     <l n="291">While yet untempted , I was safe and well ;</l>
     <l n="292">Temptation came ; I reason 'd , and I fell :</l>
     <l n="293">To be man 's guide and glory I design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="294">A rare example for our sinful kind ;</l>
     <l n="295">But now my weakness and my guilt I see ,</l>
     <l n="296">And am a warning — man , be warn 'd by me ! ”</l>
     <l n="297">He said , and saw no more the human face ;</l>
     <l n="298">To a lone loft he went , his dying place ,</l>
     <l n="299">And , as the vicar of his state inquired ,</l>
     <l n="300">Turn 'd to the wall and silently expired !</l>

     <l n="12">OBSERVE yon tenement , apart and small ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where the wet pebbles shine upon the wall ;</l>
     <l n="14">Where the low benches lean beside the door ,</l>
     <l n="15">And the red paling bounds the space before ;</l>
     <l n="16">Where thrift and lavender , and lad'shYpppHeNlove bloom , -</l>
     <l n="17">That humble dwelling is the widow 's home ;</l>
     <l n="18">There live a pair , for various fortunes known ,</l>
     <l n="19">But the blind EUen will relate her own ; -</l>
     <l n="20">Yet ere we hear the story she can tell ,</l>
     <l n="21">On prouder sorrows let us briefly dwell .</l>
     <l n="22">I 've often marvell 'd , when , by night , by day ,</l>
     <l n="23">I 've mark 'd the manners moving in my way ,</l>
     <l n="24">And heard the language and beheld the lives</l>
     <l n="25">Of lass and lover , goddesses and wives ,</l>
     <l n="26">That books , which promise much of life to give ,</l>
     <l n="27">Should show so little how we truly live .</l>
     <l n="28">To me , it seems , their females and their men</l>
     <l n="29">Are but the creatures of the author 's pen ;</l>
     <l n="30">Nay , creatures borrow 'd and again convey 'd</l>
     <l n="31">From book to book — the shadows of a shade :</l>
     <l n="32">Life , if they 'd search , would show them many a change ;</l>
     <l n="33">The ruin sudden , and the misery strange !</l>
     <l n="34">With more of grievous , base , and dreadful things ,</l>
     <l n="35">Than novelists relate or poet sings :</l>
     <l n="36">But they , who ought to look the world around ,</l>
     <l n="37">Spy out a single spot in fairy-ground ;</l>
     <l n="38">Where all , in turn , ideal forms behold ,</l>
     <l n="39">And plots are laid and histories are told .</l>
     <l n="40">Time have I lent — I would their debt were less -</l>
     <l n="41">To flow'ry pages of sublime distress ;</l>
     <l n="42">And to the heroine 's soul-distracting fears</l>
     <l n="43">I early gave my sixpences and tears :</l>
     <l n="44">Oft have I travell 'd in these tender tales ,</l>
     <l n="45">To Darnley-Cottages and Maple-Vales ,</l>
     <l n="46">And watch 'd the fair-one from the first-born sigh ,</l>
     <l n="47">When Henry pass 'd and gazed in passing by ;</l>
     <l n="48">Till I beheld them pacing in the park</l>
     <l n="49">Close by a coppice where ‘ twas cold and dark ;</l>
     <l n="50">When such affection with such fate appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="51">Want and a father to be shunn 'd and fear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="52">Without employment , prospect , cot , or cash ;</l>
     <l n="53">That I have judged th ’ heroic souls were rash .</l>
     <l n="54">Now shifts the scene ,— the fair in tower confined ,</l>
     <l n="55">In all things suffers but in change of mind ;</l>
     <l n="56">Now woo 'd by greatness to a bed of state ,</l>
     <l n="57">Now deeply threaten 'd with a dungeon 's grate ;</l>
     <l n="58">Till , suffering much , and being tried enough ,</l>
     <l n="59">She shines , triumphant maid !— temptation-proof .</l>
     <l n="60">Then was I led to vengeful monks , who mix</l>
     <l n="61">With nymphs and swains , and play unpriestly tricks ;</l>
     <l n="62">Then view 'd banditti who in forest wide ,</l>
     <l n="63">And cavern vast , indignant virgins hide ;</l>
     <l n="64">Who , hemm 'd with bands of sturdiest rogues about ,</l>
     <l n="65">Find some strange succour , and come virgins out .</l>
     <l n="66">I 've watch 'd a wint'ry night on castle-walls ,</l>
     <l n="67">I 've stalk 'd by moonlight through deserted halls ,</l>
     <l n="68">And when the weary world was sunk to rest ,</l>
     <l n="69">I 've had such sights as may not be express 'd .</l>
     <l n="70">Lo ! that chateau , the western tower decay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="71">The peasants shun it ,— they are all afraid ;</l>
     <l n="72">For there was done a deed !— could walls reveal ,</l>
     <l n="73">Or timbers tell it , how the heart would feel !</l>
     <l n="74">Most horrid was it : — for , behold , the floor</l>
     <l n="75">Has stain of blood , and will be clean no more :</l>
     <l n="76">Hark to the winds ! which through the wide saloon</l>
     <l n="77">And the long passage send a dismal tune , -</l>
     <l n="78">Music that ghosts delight in ; and now heed</l>
     <l n="79">Yon beauteous nymph , who must unmask the deed ;</l>
     <l n="80">See ! with majestic sweep she swims alone ,</l>
     <l n="81">Through rooms , all dreary , guided by a groan :</l>
     <l n="82">Though windows rattle , and though tap'stries shake ,</l>
     <l n="83">And the feet falter every step they take ,</l>
     <l n="84">‘ Mid moans and gibing sprights she silent goes ,</l>
     <l n="85">To find a something , which will soon expose</l>
     <l n="86">The villanies and wiles of her determined foes :</l>
     <l n="87">And , having thus adventured , thus endured ,</l>
     <l n="88">Fame , wealth , and lover , are for life secured .</l>
     <l n="89">Much have I fear 'd , but am no more afraid ,</l>
     <l n="90">When some chaste beauty , by some wretch betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="91">Is drawn away with such distracted speed ,</l>
     <l n="92">That she anticipates a dreadful deed :</l>
     <l n="93">Not so do I — Let solid walls impound</l>
     <l n="94">The captive fair , and dig a moat around ;</l>
     <l n="95">Let there be brazen locks and bars of steel ,</l>
     <l n="96">And keepers cruel , such as never feel ;</l>
     <l n="97">With not a single note the purse supply ,</l>
     <l n="98">And when she begs , let men and maids deny ;</l>
     <l n="99">Be windows those from which she dares not fall ,</l>
     <l n="100">And help so distant , ‘ tis in vain to call ;</l>
     <l n="101">Still means of freedom will some power devise ,</l>
     <l n="102">And from the baffled ruffian snatch his prize .</l>
     <l n="103">To Northern Wales , in some sequester 'd spot ,</l>
     <l n="104">I 've follow 'd fair Louisa to her cot :</l>
     <l n="105">Where , then a wretched and deserted bride ,</l>
     <l n="106">The injur 'd fair-one wished from man to hide ;</l>
     <l n="107">Till by her fond repenting Belville found ,</l>
     <l n="108">By some kind chance — the straying of a hound ,</l>
     <l n="109">He at her feet craved mercy , nor in vain ,</l>
     <l n="110">For the relenting dove flew back again .</l>
     <l n="111">There 's something rapturous in distress , or oh !</l>
     <l n="112">Could Clementina bear her lot of woe ?</l>
     <l n="113">Or what she underwent could maiden undergoe ?</l>
     <l n="114">The day was fix 'd ; for so the lover sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="115">So knelt and craved , he could n't be denied ;</l>
     <l n="116">When , tale most dreadful ! every hope adieu , -</l>
     <l n="117">For the fond lover is the brother too :</l>
     <l n="118">All other griefs abate ; this monstrous grief</l>
     <l n="119">Has no remission , comfort , or relief ;</l>
     <l n="120">Four ample volumes , through each page disclose , -</l>
     <l n="121">Good Heaven protect us ! only woes on woes ;</l>
     <l n="122">Till some strange means afford a sudden view</l>
     <l n="123">Of some vile plot , and every woe adieu !</l>
     <l n="124">Now , should we grant these beauties all endure</l>
     <l n="125">Severest pangs , they 've still the speediest cure ;</l>
     <l n="126">Before one charm be withered from the face ,</l>
     <l n="127">Except the bloom , which shall again have place ,</l>
     <l n="128">In wedlock ends each wish , in triumph all disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="129">And life to come , we fairly may suppose ,</l>
     <l n="130">One light , bright contrast to these wild dark woes .</l>
     <l n="131">These let us leave , and at her sorrows look ,</l>
     <l n="132">Too often seen , but seldom in a book ;</l>
     <l n="133">Let her who felt , relate them ;— on her chair</l>
     <l n="134">The heroine sits — in former years , the fair ,</l>
     <l n="135">Now aged and poor ; but Ellen Orford knows</l>
     <l n="136">That we should humbly take what Heaven bestows .</l>
     <l n="137">“ My father died — again my mother wed ,</l>
     <l n="138">And found the comforts of her life were fled ;</l>
     <l n="139">Her angry husband , vex 'd through half his years</l>
     <l n="140">By loss and troubles , filled her soul with fears :</l>
     <l n="141">Their children many , and ‘ twas my poor place</l>
     <l n="142">To nurse and wait on all the infant-race ;</l>
     <l n="143">Labour and hunger were indeed my part ,</l>
     <l n="144">And should have strengthen 'd an erroneous heart .</l>
     <l n="145">“ Sore was the grief to see him angry come ,</l>
     <l n="146">And teased with business , make distress at home ;</l>
     <l n="147">The father 's fury and the children 's cries</l>
     <l n="148">I soon could bear , but not my mother 's sighs ;</l>
     <l n="149">For she look 'd back on comforts , and would say ,</l>
     <l n="150">‘ I wrong 'd thee , Ellen , ’ and then turn away :</l>
     <l n="151">Thus , for my age 's good , my youth was tried ,</l>
     <l n="152">And this my fortune till my mother died .</l>
     <l n="153">“ So , amid sorrow much and little cheer -</l>
     <l n="154">A common case — I pass 'd my twentieth year ;</l>
     <l n="155">For these are frequent evils ; thousands share</l>
     <l n="156">An equal grief — the like domestic care .</l>
     <l n="157">“ Then in my days of bloom , of health , and youth ,</l>
     <l n="158">One , much above me , vow 'd his love and truth :</l>
     <l n="159">We often met , he dreading to be seen ,</l>
     <l n="160">And much I question 'd what such dread might mean ;</l>
     <l n="161">Yet I believed him true ; my simple heart</l>
     <l n="162">And undirected reason took his part .</l>
     <l n="163">“ Can he who loves me , whom I love , deceive ?</l>
     <l n="164">Can I such wrong of one so kind believe ,</l>
     <l n="165">Who lives but in my smile , who trembles when I grieve ?</l>
     <l n="166">“ He dared not marry , but we met to prove</l>
     <l n="167">What sad encroachments and deceits has love :</l>
     <l n="168">Weak that I was , when he , rebuked , withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="169">I let him see that I was wretched too ;</l>
     <l n="170">When less my caution , I had still the pain</l>
     <l n="171">Of his or mine own weakness to complain .</l>
     <l n="172">“ Happy the lovers class 'd alike in life ,</l>
     <l n="173">Or happier yet the rich endowing wife ;</l>
     <l n="174">But most aggrieved the fond believing maid .</l>
     <l n="175">Of her rich lover tenderly afraid :</l>
     <l n="176">You judge th ’ event ; for grievous was my fate ,</l>
     <l n="177">Painful to feel , and shameful to relate :</l>
     <l n="178">Ah ! sad it was my burthen to sustain ,</l>
     <l n="179">When the least misery was the dread of pain ;</l>
     <l n="180">When I have grieving told him my disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="181">And plainly mark 'd indifference in his face .</l>
     <l n="182">“ Hard ! with these fears and terrors to behold</l>
     <l n="183">The cause of all , the faithless lover , cold ;</l>
     <l n="184">Impatient grown at every wish denied ,</l>
     <l n="185">And barely civil , soothed and gratified ;</l>
     <l n="186">Peevish when urged to think of vows so strong ,</l>
     <l n="187">And angry when I spake of crime and wrong .</l>
     <l n="188">All this I felt , and still the sorrow grew ,</l>
     <l n="189">Because I felt that I deserved it too ,</l>
     <l n="190">And begg 'd my infant stranger to forgive</l>
     <l n="191">The mother 's shame , which in herself must live .</l>
     <l n="192">When known that shame , I , soon expell 'd from home ,</l>
     <l n="193">With a frail sister shared a hovel 's gloom ;</l>
     <l n="194">There barely fed — ( what could I more request ? )</l>
     <l n="195">My infant slumberer sleeping at my breast ,</l>
     <l n="196">I from my window saw his blooming bride ,</l>
     <l n="197">And my seducer smiling at her side ;</l>
     <l n="198">Hope lived till then ; I sank upon the floor ,</l>
     <l n="199">And grief and thought and feeling were no more :</l>
     <l n="200">Although revived , I judged that life would close ,</l>
     <l n="201">And went to rest , to wonder that I rose :</l>
     <l n="202">My dreams were dismal ,— wheresoe'er I stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="203">I seem 'd ashamed , alarm 'd , despised , betray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="204">Always in grief , in guilt , disgraced , forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="205">Mourning that one so weak , so vile , was born ;</l>
     <l n="206">The earth a desert , tumult in the sea ,</l>
     <l n="207">The birds affrighten 'd fled from tree to tree ,</l>
     <l n="208">Obscured the setting sun , and every thing like me .</l>
     <l n="209">But Heav'n had mercy , and my need at length</l>
     <l n="210">Urged me to labour , and renew 'd my strength .</l>
     <l n="211">I strove for patience as a sinner must ,</l>
     <l n="212">Yet felt th ’ opinion of the world unjust :</l>
     <l n="213">There was my lover , in his joy esteem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="214">And I , in my distress , as guilty deemed ;</l>
     <l n="215">Yet sure , not all the guilt and shame belong</l>
     <l n="216">To her who feels and suffers for the wrong :</l>
     <l n="217">The cheat at play may use the wealth he 's won ,</l>
     <l n="218">But is not honour 'd for the mischief done ;</l>
     <l n="219">The cheat in love may use each villain art ,</l>
     <l n="220">And boast the deed that breaks the victim 's heart .</l>
     <l n="221">“ Four years were past ; I might again have found</l>
     <l n="222">Some erring wish , but for another wound :</l>
     <l n="223">Lovely my daughter grew , her face was fair ,</l>
     <l n="224">But no expression ever brighten 'd there ;</l>
     <l n="225">I doubted long , and vainly strove to make</l>
     <l n="226">Some certain meaning of the words she spake ;</l>
     <l n="227">But meaning there was none , and I survey 'd</l>
     <l n="228">With dread the beauties of my idiot-maid .</l>
     <l n="229">Still I submitted ;— Oh ! ‘ tis meet and fit</l>
     <l n="230">In all we feel to make the heart submit ;</l>
     <l n="231">Gloomy and calm my days , but I had then ,</l>
     <l n="232">It seem 'd , attractions for the eyes of men :</l>
     <l n="233">The sober master of a decent trade</l>
     <l n="234">O'erlook ' d my errors , and his offer made ;</l>
     <l n="235">Reason assented : — true , my heart denied ,</l>
     <l n="236">‘ But thou , ’ I said ,' shalt be no more my guide . ’</l>
     <l n="237">“ When wed , our toil and trouble , pains and care ,</l>
     <l n="238">Of means to live procured us humble share ;</l>
     <l n="239">Five were our sons ,— and we , though careful , found</l>
     <l n="240">Our hopes declining as the year came round :</l>
     <l n="241">For I perceived , yet would not soon perceive ,</l>
     <l n="242">My husband stealing from my view to grieve :</l>
     <l n="243">Silent he grew , and when he spoke he sigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="244">And surly look 'd , and peevishly replied :</l>
     <l n="245">Pensive by nature , he had gone of late</l>
     <l n="246">To those who preach 'd of destiny and fate ,</l>
     <l n="247">Of things foredoom 'd , and of election-grace ,</l>
     <l n="248">And how in vain we strive to run our race ;</l>
     <l n="249">That all by works and moral worth we gain</l>
     <l n="250">Is to perceive our care and labour vain ;</l>
     <l n="251">That still the more we pay , our debts the more remain ;</l>
     <l n="252">That he who feels not the mysterious call ,</l>
     <l n="253">Lies bound in sin , still grov'ling from the fall .</l>
     <l n="254">My husband felt not : — our persuasion , prayer ,</l>
     <l n="255">And our best reason , darken 'd his despair ;</l>
     <l n="256">His very nature changed ; he now reviled</l>
     <l n="257">My former conduct ,— he reproach 'd my child :</l>
     <l n="258">He talked of bastard slips , and cursed his bed ,</l>
     <l n="259">And from our kindness to concealment fled ;</l>
     <l n="260">For ever to some evil change inclined ,</l>
     <l n="261">To every gloomy thought he lent his mind ,</l>
     <l n="262">Nor rest would give to us , nor rest himself could find ;</l>
     <l n="263">His son suspended saw him , long bereft</l>
     <l n="264">Of life , nor prospect of revival left .</l>
     <l n="265">“ With him died all our prospects , and once more</l>
     <l n="266">I shared th ’ allotments of the parish poor ;</l>
     <l n="267">They took my children too , and this I know</l>
     <l n="268">Was just and lawful , but I felt the blow :</l>
     <l n="269">My idiot-maid and one unhealthy boy</l>
     <l n="270">Were left , a mother 's misery and her joy .</l>
     <l n="271">“ Three sons I follow 'd to the grave , and one -</l>
     <l n="272">Oh ! can I speak of that unhappy son ?</l>
     <l n="273">Would all the memory of that time were fled ,</l>
     <l n="274">And all those horrors , with my child , were dead !</l>
     <l n="275">Before the world seduced him , what a grace</l>
     <l n="276">And smile of gladness shone upon his face !</l>
     <l n="277">Then , he had knowledge ; finely would he write ;</l>
     <l n="278">Study to him was pleasure and delight ;</l>
     <l n="279">Great was his courage , and but few could stand</l>
     <l n="280">Against the sleight and vigour of his hand ;</l>
     <l n="281">The maidens loved him ;— when he came to die ,</l>
     <l n="282">No , not the coldest could suppress a sigh :</l>
     <l n="283">Here I must cease — how can I say , my child</l>
     <l n="284">Was by the bad of either sex beguiled ?</l>
     <l n="285">Worst of the bad — they taught him that the laws</l>
     <l n="286">Made wrong and right ; there was no other cause ,</l>
     <l n="287">That all religion was the trade of priests ,</l>
     <l n="288">And men , when dead , must perish like the beasts : -</l>
     <l n="289">And he , so lively and so gay , before -</l>
     <l n="290">Ah ; spare a mother — I can tell no more .</l>
     <l n="291">“ Int'rest was made that they should not destroy</l>
     <l n="292">The comely form of my deluded boy -</l>
     <l n="293">But pardon came not ; damp the place and deep</l>
     <l n="294">Where he was kept , as they 'd a tiger keep ;</l>
     <l n="295">For he , unhappy ! had before them all</l>
     <l n="296">Vow 'd he 'd escape , whatever might befall .</l>
     <l n="297">He 'd means of dress , and dress 'd beyond his means ,</l>
     <l n="298">And so to see him in such dismal scenes ,</l>
     <l n="299">I cannot speak it — cannot bear to tell</l>
     <l n="300">Of that sad hour — I heard the passing bell !</l>
     <l n="301">“ Slowly they went ; he smiled , and look 'd so smart ,</l>
     <l n="302">Yet sure he shudder 'd when he saw the cart ,</l>
     <l n="303">And gave a look — until my dying day ,</l>
     <l n="304">That look will never from my mind away :</l>
     <l n="305">Oft as I sit , and ever in my dreams ,</l>
     <l n="306">I see that look , and they have heard my screams .</l>
     <l n="307">“ Now let me speak no more — yet all declared</l>
     <l n="308">That one so young , in pity , should be spared .</l>
     <l n="309">And one so manly ;— on his graceful neck ,</l>
     <l n="310">That chains of jewels may be proud to deck ,</l>
     <l n="311">To a small mole a mother 's lips have press 'd -</l>
     <l n="312">And there the cord — my breath is sore oppress 'd .</l>
     <l n="313">“ I now can speak again : — my elder boy</l>
     <l n="314">Was that year drown 'd ,— a seaman in a hoy :</l>
     <l n="315">He left a numerous race ; of these would some</l>
     <l n="316">In their young troubles to my cottage come ,</l>
     <l n="317">And these I taught — an humble teacher I -</l>
     <l n="318">Upon their heavenly Parent to rely .</l>
     <l n="319">“ Alas ! I needed such reliance more :</l>
     <l n="320">My idiot-girl , so simply gay before ,</l>
     <l n="321">Now wept in pain : some wretch had found a time ,</l>
     <l n="322">Depraved and wicked , for that coward crime ;</l>
     <l n="323">I had indeed my doubt , but I suppress 'd</l>
     <l n="324">The thought that day and night disturb 'd my rest ;</l>
     <l n="325">She and that sick-pale brother — but why strive</l>
     <l n="326">To keep the terrors of that time alive ?</l>
     <l n="327">“ The hour arrived , the new , th ’ undreaded pain ,</l>
     <l n="328">That came with violence , and yet came in vain .</l>
     <l n="329">I saw her die : her brother too is dead ;</l>
     <l n="330">Nor own 'd such crime — what is it that I dread ?</l>
     <l n="331">“ The parish aid withdrawn , I look 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="332">And in my school a bless 'd subsistence found -</l>
     <l n="333">My winter-calm of life : to be of use</l>
     <l n="334">Would pleasant thoughts and heavenly hopes produce ;</l>
     <l n="335">I loved them all ; it soothed me to presage</l>
     <l n="336">The various trials of their riper age ,</l>
     <l n="337">Then dwell on mine , and bless the Power who gave</l>
     <l n="338">Pains to correct us , and remorse to save .</l>
     <l n="339">“ Yes ! these were days of peace , but they are past , -</l>
     <l n="340">A trial came , I will believe , a last ;</l>
     <l n="341">I lost my sight , and my employment gone ,</l>
     <l n="342">Useless I live , but to the day live on ;</l>
     <l n="343">Those eyes which long the light of heaven enjoy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="344">Were not by pain , by agony destroy 'd :</l>
     <l n="345">My senses fail not all ; I speak , I pray ;</l>
     <l n="346">By night my rest , my food I take by day ;</l>
     <l n="347">And , as my mind looks cheerful to my end ,</l>
     <l n="348">I love mankind , and call my GOD my friend . ”</l>

    <head>LETTER XXI .</head>
    <head>THE POOR OF THE BOROUGH .</head>
    <head>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly , that , in the latter times , some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils . Epistle to Timothy .</head>
    <head>ABEL KEENE .</head>
    <head>Abel , a poor man , Teacher of a School of the lower Order ; is placed in the Office of a Merchant ; is alarmed by Discourses of the Clerks ; unable to reply ; becomes a Convert ; dresses , drinks , and ridicules his former conduct — The Remonstrance of his Sister , a devout Maiden - - Its Effect — The Merchant dies — Abel returns to Poverty unpitied ; but relieved — His abject Condition — His Melancholy — He wanders about ; is found — His own Account of himself and the Revolutions in his Mind .</head>
     <l n="1">A QUIET , simple man was Abel Keene ,</l>
     <l n="2">He meant no harm , nor did he often mean ;</l>
     <l n="3">He kept a school of loud rebellious boys ,</l>
     <l n="4">And growing old , grew nervous with the noise ;</l>
     <l n="5">When a kind merchant hired his useful pen ,</l>
     <l n="6">And made him happiest of accompting men ;</l>
     <l n="7">With glee he rose to every easy day ,</l>
     <l n="8">When half the labour brought him twice the pay .</l>
     <l n="9">There were young clerks , and there the merchant 's son ,</l>
     <l n="10">Choice spirits all , who wish 'd him to be one ;</l>
     <l n="11">It must , no question , give them lively joy ,</l>
     <l n="12">Hopes long indulged to combat and destroy ;</l>
     <l n="13">At these they levelled all their skill and strength , -</l>
     <l n="14">He fell not quickly , but he fell at length :</l>
     <l n="15">They quoted books , to him both bold and new ,</l>
     <l n="16">And scorn 'd as fables all he held as true ;</l>
     <l n="17">“ Such monkish stories , and such nursery lies , ”</l>
     <l n="18">That he was struck with terror and surprise .</l>
     <l n="19">“ What ! all his life had he the laws obey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="20">Which they broke through and were not once afraid ?</l>
     <l n="21">Had he so long his evil passions check 'd ,</l>
     <l n="22">And yet at last had nothing to expect ?</l>
     <l n="23">While they their lives in joy and pleasure led ,</l>
     <l n="24">And then had nothing at the end to dread ?</l>
     <l n="25">Was all his priest with so much zeal convey 'd</l>
     <l n="26">A part ! a speech ! for which the man was paid !</l>
     <l n="27">And were his pious books , his solemn prayers ,</l>
     <l n="28">Not worth one tale of the admir 'd Voltaire 's ?</l>
     <l n="29">Then was it time , while yet some years remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="30">To drink untroubled and to think unchain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">And on all pleasues , which his purse could give ,</l>
     <l n="32">Freely to seize , and while he lived , to live . ”</l>
     <l n="33">Much time he pass 'd in this important strife ,</l>
     <l n="34">The bliss or bane of his remaining life ;</l>
     <l n="35">For converts all are made with care and grief ,</l>
     <l n="36">And pangs attend the birth of unbelief ;</l>
     <l n="37">Nor pass they soon ;— with awe and fear he took</l>
     <l n="38">The flowery way , and cast back many a look .</l>
     <l n="39">The youths applauded much his wise design ,</l>
     <l n="40">With weighty reasoning o'er their evening wine ;</l>
     <l n="41">And much in private ‘ twould their mirth improve ,</l>
     <l n="42">To hear how Abel spake of life and love ;</l>
     <l n="43">To hear him own what grievous pains it cost ,</l>
     <l n="44">Ere the old saint was in the sinner lost ,</l>
     <l n="45">Ere his poor mind , with every deed alarm 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">By wit was settled , and by vice was charm 'd .</l>
     <l n="47">For Abel enter 'd in his bold career ,</l>
     <l n="48">Like boys on ice , with pleasure and with fear ;</l>
     <l n="49">Lingering , yet longing for the joy , he went ,</l>
     <l n="50">Repenting now , now dreading to repent :</l>
     <l n="51">With awkward pace , and with himself at war ,</l>
     <l n="52">Far gone , yet frighten 'd that he went so far ;</l>
     <l n="53">Oft for his efforts he 'd solicit praise ,</l>
     <l n="54">And then proceed with blunders and delays :</l>
     <l n="55">The young more aptly passions ’ calls pursue ,</l>
     <l n="56">But age and weakness start at scenes so new ,</l>
     <l n="57">And tremble , when they 've done , for all they dared to do .</l>
     <l n="58">At length example Abel 's dread removed ,</l>
     <l n="59">With small concern he sought the joys he loved ;</l>
     <l n="60">Not resting here , he claim 'd his share of fame ,</l>
     <l n="61">And first their votary , then their wit became ;</l>
     <l n="62">His jest was bitter and his satire bold ,</l>
     <l n="63">When he his tales of formal brethren told ;</l>
     <l n="64">What time with pious neighbours he discuss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="65">Their boasted treasure and their boundless trust :</l>
     <l n="66">“ Such were our dreams , ” the jovial elder cried ;</l>
     <l n="67">“ Awake and live , ” his youthful friends replied .</l>
     <l n="68">Now the gay clerk a modest drab despised ,</l>
     <l n="69">And clad him smartly , as his friends advised ;</l>
     <l n="70">So fine a coat upon his back he threw ,</l>
     <l n="71">That not an alley-boy old Abel knew ;</l>
     <l n="72">Broad polish 'd buttons blazed that coat upon ,</l>
     <l n="73">And just beneath the watch 's trinkets shone , -</l>
     <l n="74">A splendid watch , that pointed out the time ,</l>
     <l n="75">To fly from business and make free with crime :</l>
     <l n="76">The crimson waistcoat and the silken hose</l>
     <l n="77">Rank 'd the lean man among the Borough beaux :</l>
     <l n="78">His raven hair he cropp 'd with fierce disdain ,</l>
     <l n="79">And light elastic locks encased his brain :</l>
     <l n="80">More pliant pupil who could hope to find ,</l>
     <l n="81">Se deck 'd in person and so changed in mind ?</l>
     <l n="82">When Abel walked the streets , with pleasent mien</l>
     <l n="83">He met his friends , delighted to be seen ;</l>
     <l n="84">And when he rode along the public way ,</l>
     <l n="85">No beau so gaudy , and no youth so gay .</l>
     <l n="86">His pious sister , now an ancient maid ,</l>
     <l n="87">For Abel fearing , first in secret pray 'd ;</l>
     <l n="88">Then thus in love and scorn her notions she convey 'd .</l>
     <l n="89">“ Alas ! my brother ! can I see thee pace</l>
     <l n="90">Hoodwink 'd to hell , and not lament thy case ,</l>
     <l n="91">Nor stretch my feeble hand to stop thy headlong race ?</l>
     <l n="92">Lo ! thou art bound ; a slave in Satan 's chain ;</l>
     <l n="93">The righteous Abel turn 'd the wretched Cain ;</l>
     <l n="94">His brother 's blood against the murderer cried ,</l>
     <l n="95">Against thee thine , unhappy suicide !</l>
     <l n="96">Are all our pious nights and peaceful days ,</l>
     <l n="97">Our evening readings and our morning praise ,</l>
     <l n="98">Our spirits ’ comfort in the trials sent ,</l>
     <l n="99">Our hearts ’ rejoicings in the blessings lent ,</l>
     <l n="100">All that o'er grief a cheering influence shed ,</l>
     <l n="101">Are these for ever and for ever fled ?</l>
     <l n="102">“ When in the years gone by , the trying years ,</l>
     <l n="103">When faith and hope had strife with wants and fears ,</l>
     <l n="104">Thy nerves have trembled till thou couldst not eat</l>
     <l n="105">( Dress 'd by this hand ) thy mess of simple meat ;</l>
     <l n="106">When , grieved by fastings , gall 'd by fates severe ,</l>
     <l n="107">Slow pass 'd the days of the successless year ;</l>
     <l n="108">Still in these gloomy hours , my brother then</l>
     <l n="109">Had glorious views , unseen by prosperous men :</l>
     <l n="110">And when thy heart has felt its wish denied ,</l>
     <l n="111">What gracious texts hast thou to grief applied ;</l>
     <l n="112">Till thou hast enter 'd in thine humble bed ,</l>
     <l n="113">By lofty hopes and heavenly musings fed ;</l>
     <l n="114">Then I have seen thy lively looks express</l>
     <l n="115">The spirit 's comforts in the man 's distress .</l>
     <l n="116">“ Then didst thou cry , exulting , ‘ Yes , ‘ tis fit ,</l>
     <l n="117">‘ Tis meet and right , my heart ! that we submit : ’</l>
     <l n="118">And wilt thou , Abel , thy new pleasures weigh</l>
     <l n="119">Against such triumphs ?— Oh ? repent and pray .</l>
     <l n="120">“ What are thy pleasures ?— with the gay to sit ,</l>
     <l n="121">And thy poor brain torment for awkward wit ;</l>
     <l n="122">All thy good thoughts ( thou hat'st them ) to restrain ,</l>
     <l n="123">And give a wicked pleasure to the vain ;</l>
     <l n="124">Thy long , lean frame by fashion to attire ,</l>
     <l n="125">That lads may laugh and wantons may admire ;</l>
     <l n="126">To raise the mirth of boys , and not to see ,</l>
     <l n="127">Unhappy maniac ! that they laugh at thee</l>
     <l n="128">“ These boyish follies , which alone the boy</l>
     <l n="129">Can idly act , or gracefully enjoy ,</l>
     <l n="130">Add new reproaches to thy fallen state ,</l>
     <l n="131">And make men scorn what they would only hate .</l>
     <l n="132">“ What pains , my brother , dost thou take to prove</l>
     <l n="133">A taste for follies which thou canst not love !</l>
     <l n="134">Why do thy stiffening limbs the steed bestride -</l>
     <l n="135">That lads may laugh to see thou canst not ride ?</l>
     <l n="136">And why ( I feel the crimson tinge my cheek )</l>
     <l n="137">Dost thou by night in Diamond-Alley sneak ?</l>
     <l n="138">“ Farewell ! the parish will thy sister keep ,</l>
     <l n="139">Where she in peace shall pray and sing and sleep ,</l>
     <l n="140">Save when for thee she mourns , thou wicked , wandering sheep .</l>
     <l n="141">When youth is fallen , there 's hope the young may rise ,</l>
     <l n="142">But fallen age for ever hopeless lies ;</l>
     <l n="143">Torn up by storms , and placed in earth once more ,</l>
     <l n="144">The younger tree may sun and soil restore ;</l>
     <l n="145">But when the old and sapless trunk lies low ,</l>
     <l n="146">No care or soil can former life bestow ;</l>
     <l n="147">Reserved for burning is the worthless tree -</l>
     <l n="148">And what , O Abel ! is reserved for thee ? ”</l>
     <l n="149">These angry words our hero deeply felt ,</l>
     <l n="150">Though hard his heart , and indisposed to melt !</l>
     <l n="151">To gain relief he took a glass the more ,</l>
     <l n="152">And then went on as careless as before ;</l>
     <l n="153">Thenceforth , uncheck 'd , amusements he partook ,</l>
     <l n="154">And ( save his ledger ) saw no decent book ;</l>
     <l n="155">Him found the merchant punctual at his task ,</l>
     <l n="156">And that performed , he 'd nothing more to ask ;</l>
     <l n="157">He cared not how old Abel play 'd the fool ,</l>
     <l n="158">No master he , beyond the hours of school :</l>
     <l n="159">Thus they proceeding , had their wine and joke ,</l>
     <l n="160">Till merchant Dixon felt a warning stroke ,</l>
     <l n="161">And , after struggling half a gloomy week ,</l>
     <l n="162">Left his poor clerk another friend to seek .</l>
     <l n="163">Alas ! the son , who led the saint astray ,</l>
     <l n="164">Forgot the man whose follies made him gay ;</l>
     <l n="165">He cared no more for Abel in his need ,</l>
     <l n="166">Than Abel cared about his hackney steed :</l>
     <l n="167">He now , alas ! had all his earnings spent ,</l>
     <l n="168">And thus was left to languish and repent ;</l>
     <l n="169">No school nor clerkship found he in the place ,</l>
     <l n="170">Now lost to fortune , as before to grace .</l>
     <l n="171">For town-relief the grieving man applied ,</l>
     <l n="172">And begg 'd with tears what some with scorn denied ;</l>
     <l n="173">Others look 'd down upon the glowing vest ,</l>
     <l n="174">And frowning , ask 'd him at what price he dress 'd ?</l>
     <l n="175">Happy for him his country 's laws are mild ,</l>
     <l n="176">They must support him , though they still reviled ;</l>
     <l n="177">Grieved , abject , scorn 'd , insulted , and betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="178">Of God unmindful , and of man afraid , -</l>
     <l n="179">No more he talk 'd ; ‘ twas pain , ‘ twas shame to speak ,</l>
     <l n="180">His heart was sinking , and his frame was weak .</l>
     <l n="181">His sister died with such serene delight ,</l>
     <l n="182">He once again began to think her right ;</l>
     <l n="183">Poor like himself , the happy spinster lay ,</l>
     <l n="184">And sweet assurance bless 'd her dying-day :</l>
     <l n="185">Poor like the spinster , he , when death was nigh ,</l>
     <l n="186">Assured of nothing , felt afraid to die .</l>
     <l n="187">The cheerful clerks who sometimes pass 'd the door ,</l>
     <l n="188">Just mention 'd “ Abel ! ” and then thought no more .</l>
     <l n="189">So Abel , pondering on his state forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="190">Look 'd round for comfort , and was chased by scorn .</l>
     <l n="191">And now we saw him on the beach reclined ,</l>
     <l n="192">Or causeless walking in the wintry wind ;</l>
     <l n="193">And when it raised a loud and angry sea ,</l>
     <l n="194">He stood and gazed , in wretched reverie :</l>
     <l n="195">He heeded not the frost , the rain , the snow ,</l>
     <l n="196">Close by the sea he walk 'd alone and slow :</l>
     <l n="197">Sometimes his frame through many an hour he spread</l>
     <l n="198">Upon a tombstone , moveless as the dead ;</l>
     <l n="199">And was there found a sad and silent place ,</l>
     <l n="200">There would he creep with slow and measured pace ;</l>
     <l n="201">Then would he wander by the river 's side ,</l>
     <l n="202">And fix his eyes upon the falling tide ;</l>
     <l n="203">The deep dry ditch , the rushes in the fen ,</l>
     <l n="204">And mossy crag-pits were his lodgings then :</l>
     <l n="205">There , to his discontented thought a prey ,</l>
     <l n="206">The melancholy mortal pined away .</l>
     <l n="207">The neighb'ring poor at length began to speak</l>
     <l n="208">Of Abel 's ramblings — he 'd been gone a week ;</l>
     <l n="209">They knew not where , and little care they took</l>
     <l n="210">For one so friendless and so poor to look .</l>
     <l n="211">At last a stranger , in a pedlar 's shed ,</l>
     <l n="212">Beheld him hanging — he had long been dead .</l>
     <l n="213">He left a paper , penn 'd at sundry times ,</l>
     <l n="214">Entitled thus — “ My Groanings and my Crimes ! ”</l>
     <l n="215">“ I was a Christian man , and none could lay</l>
     <l n="216">Aught to my charge ; I walk 'd the narrow way :</l>
     <l n="217">All then was simple faith , serene and pure ,</l>
     <l n="218">My hope was stedfast and my prospects sure ;</l>
     <l n="219">Then was I tried by want and sickness sore ,</l>
     <l n="220">But these I clapp 'd my shield of faith before ,</l>
     <l n="221">And cares and wants and man 's rebukes I bore :</l>
     <l n="222">Alas ! new foes assail 'd me ; I was vain ,</l>
     <l n="223">They stung my pride and they confused my brain :</l>
     <l n="224">Oh ! these deluders ! with what glee they saw</l>
     <l n="225">Their simple dupe transgress the righteous law ;</l>
     <l n="226">‘ Twas joy to them to view that dreadful strife ,</l>
     <l n="227">When faith and frailty warr 'd for more than life ;</l>
     <l n="228">So with their pleasures they beguiled the heart ,</l>
     <l n="229">Then with their logic they allay 'd the smart ;</l>
     <l n="230">They proved ( so thought I then ) with reasons strong ,</l>
     <l n="231">That no man 's feelings ever lead him wrong :</l>
     <l n="232">And thus I went , as on the varnish 'd ice ,</l>
     <l n="233">The smooth career of unbelief and vice .</l>
     <l n="234">Oft would the youths , with sprightly speech and bold ,</l>
     <l n="235">Their witty tales of naughty priests unfold ;</l>
     <l n="236">‘ Twas all a craft , ’ they said , ‘ a cunning trade ;</l>
     <l n="237">Not she the priests , but priests Religion made . ’</l>
     <l n="238">So I believed : ” — No , Abel ! to thy grief :</l>
     <l n="239">So thou relinquish'dst all that was belief : -</l>
     <l n="240">“ I grew as very flint , and when the rest</l>
     <l n="241">Laugh 'd at devotion , I enjoy 'd the jest ;</l>
     <l n="242">But this all vanish 'd like the morning-dew ,</l>
     <l n="243">When unemploy 'd , and poor again I grew ;</l>
     <l n="244">Yea ! I was doubly poor , for I was wicked too .</l>
     <l n="245">“ The mouse that trespass 'd and the treasure stole ,</l>
     <l n="246">Found his lean body fitted to the hole ;</l>
     <l n="247">Till , having fatted , he was forced to stay ,</l>
     <l n="248">And , fasting , starve his stolen bulk away :</l>
     <l n="249">Ah ! worse for me — grown poor , I yet remain</l>
     <l n="250">In sinful bonds , and pray and fast in vain .</l>
     <l n="251">“ At length I thought , although these friends of sin</l>
     <l n="252">Have spread their net , and caught their prey therein ;</l>
     <l n="253">Though my hard heart could not for mercy call ,</l>
     <l n="254">Because though great my grief , my faith was small ;</l>
     <l n="255">Yet , as the sick on skilful men rely ,</l>
     <l n="256">The soul diseased may to a doctor fly .</l>
     <l n="257">“ A famous one there was , whose skill had wrought</l>
     <l n="258">Cures past belief , and him the sinners sought ;</l>
     <l n="259">Numbers there were defiled by mire and filth ,</l>
     <l n="260">Whom he recovered by his goodly tilth :</l>
     <l n="261">‘ Come then , ’ I said , ‘ let me the man behold ,</l>
     <l n="262">And tell my case : ’ — I saw him and I told .</l>
     <l n="263">“ With trembling voice , ‘ Oh ! reverend sir , ’ I said ,</l>
     <l n="264">‘ I once believed , and I was then misled ;</l>
     <l n="265">And now such doubts my sinful soul beset ,</l>
     <l n="266">I dare not say that I 'm a Christian yet ;</l>
     <l n="267">Canst thou , good sir , by thy superior skill ,</l>
     <l n="268">Inform my judgment and direct my will ?</l>
     <l n="269">Ah ! give thy cordial ; let my soul have rest ,</l>
     <l n="270">And be the outward man alone distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="271">For at my state I tremble . ’ — ‘ Tremble more , ’</l>
     <l n="272">Said the good man , ‘ and then rejoice therefore !</l>
     <l n="273">‘ Tis good to tremble ; prospects then are fair ,</l>
     <l n="274">When the lost soul is plunged in deep despair :</l>
     <l n="275">Once thou wert simply honest , just , and pure ,</l>
     <l n="276">Whole , as thou thought'st , and never wish 'd a cure :</l>
     <l n="277">Now thou hast plunged in folly , shame , disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="278">Now thou'rt an object meet for healing grace ;</l>
     <l n="279">No merit thine , no virtue , hope , belief ,</l>
     <l n="280">Nothing hast thou , but misery , sin , and grief ;</l>
     <l n="281">The best , the only titles to relief . ’</l>
     <l n="282">‘ What must I do , ’ I said , ‘ my soul to free ? ’ -</l>
     <l n="283">‘ Do nothing , man ; it will be done for thee . ’</l>
     <l n="284">‘ But must I not , my reverend guide , believe ? ’ -</l>
     <l n="285">‘ If thou art call 'd , thou wilt the faith receive . ’</l>
     <l n="286">‘ But I repent not . ’ — Angry he replied ,</l>
     <l n="287">‘ If thou art call 'd , though needest nought beside :</l>
     <l n="288">Attend on us , and if ‘ tis Heaven 's decree ,</l>
     <l n="289">The call will come ,— if not , ah ! woe for thee . ’</l>
     <l n="290">“ There then I waited , ever on the watch ,</l>
     <l n="291">A spark of hope , a ray of light to catch ;</l>
     <l n="292">His words fell softly like the flakes of snow ,</l>
     <l n="293">But I could never find my heart o'erflow :</l>
     <l n="294">He cried aloud , till in the flock began</l>
     <l n="295">The sigh , the tear , as caught from man to man ;</l>
     <l n="296">They wept and they rejoiced , and there was I</l>
     <l n="297">Hard as a flint , and as the desert dry :</l>
     <l n="298">To me no tokens of the call would come ,</l>
     <l n="299">I felt my sentence , and received my doom ;</l>
     <l n="300">But I complain 'd — ‘ Let thy repinings cease ,</l>
     <l n="301">Oh ! man of sin , for they thy guilt increase ;</l>
     <l n="302">It bloweth where it listeth ;— die in peace . ’</l>
     <l n="303">- In peace , and perish ? ’ I replied ; ‘ impart</l>
     <l n="304">Some better comfort to a burthen 'd heart . ’</l>
     <l n="305">‘ Alas ! ’ the priest return 'd , ‘ can I direct</l>
     <l n="306">The heavenly call ?— Do I proclaim th ’ elect ?</l>
     <l n="307">Raise not thy voice against th ’ Eternal will ,</l>
     <l n="308">But take thy part with sinners , and be still . ’</l>
     <l n="309">“ Alas , for me ! no more the times of peace</l>
     <l n="310">Are mine on earth — in death my pains may cease .</l>
     <l n="311">“ Foes to my soul ! ye young seducers , know</l>
     <l n="312">What serious ills from your amusements flow ;</l>
     <l n="313">Opinions you with so much ease profess ,</l>
     <l n="314">Overwhelm the simple and their minds oppress :</l>
     <l n="315">Let such be happy , nor with reasons strong ,</l>
     <l n="316">That make them wretched , prove their notions wrong ;</l>
     <l n="317">Let them proceed in that they deem the way ,</l>
     <l n="318">Fast when they will , and at their pleasure pray :</l>
     <l n="319">Yes , I have pity for my brethren 's lot ,</l>
     <l n="320">And so had Dives , but it help 'd him not :</l>
     <l n="321">And is it thus ?— I 'm full of doubts : — Adieu !</l>
     <l n="322">Perhaps his reverence is mistaken too . ” { 12 }</l>

    <head>PETER GRIMES .</head>
    <head>The Father of Peter a Fisherman — Peter 's early Conduct — His Grief for the old Man — He takes an Apprentice — The Boy 's Suffering and Fate — A second Boy ; how he died — Peter acquitted — A third Apprentice — A Voyage by Sea : the Boy does not return — Evil Report on Peter : he is tried and threatened — Lives alone — His melancholy and incipient Madness — Is observed and visited — He escapes and is taken : is lodged in a parish-house : Women attend and watch him — He speaks in a Delirium ; grows more collected — His Account of his Feelings and visionary Terrors previous to his Death .</head>
     <l n="1">OLD Peter Grimes made fishing his employ ,</l>
     <l n="2">His wife he cabin 'd with him and his boy ,</l>
     <l n="3">And seem 'd that life laborious to enjoy :</l>
     <l n="4">To town came quiet Peter with his fish ,</l>
     <l n="5">And had of all a civil word and wish .</l>
     <l n="6">He left his trade upon the Sabbath-day ,</l>
     <l n="7">And took young Peter in his hand to pray :</l>
     <l n="8">But soon the stubborn boy from care broke loose ,</l>
     <l n="9">At first refused , then added his abuse :</l>
     <l n="10">His father 's love he scorn 'd , his power defied ,</l>
     <l n="11">But being drunk , wept sorely when he died .</l>
     <l n="12">Yes ! then he wept , and to his mind there came</l>
     <l n="13">Much of his conduct , and he felt the shame , -</l>
     <l n="14">How he had oft the good old man reviled ,</l>
     <l n="15">And never paid the duty of a child ;</l>
     <l n="16">How , when the father in his Bible read ,</l>
     <l n="17">He in contempt and anger left the shed :</l>
     <l n="18">“ It is the word of life , ” the parent cried ;</l>
     <l n="19">- “ This is the life itself , ” the boy replied .</l>
     <l n="20">And while old Peter in amazement stood ,</l>
     <l n="21">Gave the hot spirits to his boiling blood : -</l>
     <l n="22">How he , with oath and furious speech , began</l>
     <l n="23">To prove his freedom and assert the man ;</l>
     <l n="24">And when the parent check 'd his impious rage ,</l>
     <l n="25">How he had cursed the tyranny of age , -</l>
     <l n="26">Nay , once had dealt the sacrilegious blow</l>
     <l n="27">On his bare head , and laid his parent low ;</l>
     <l n="28">The father groan 'd — “ If thou art old , ” said he ,</l>
     <l n="29">“ And hast a son — thou wilt remember me :</l>
     <l n="30">Thy mother left me in a happy time ,</l>
     <l n="31">Thou kill'dst not her — heav'n spares the double crime . ”</l>
     <l n="32">On an inn-settle , in his maudlin grief ,</l>
     <l n="33">This he resolved , and drank for his relief .</l>
     <l n="34">Now lived the youth in freedom , but debarr 'd</l>
     <l n="35">From constant pleasures , and he thought it hard ;</l>
     <l n="36">Hard that he could not every wish obey ,</l>
     <l n="37">But must awhile relinquish ale and play ;</l>
     <l n="38">Hard ! that he could not to his cards attend ,</l>
     <l n="39">But must acquire the money he would spend .</l>
     <l n="40">With greedy eye he look 'd on all he saw ,</l>
     <l n="41">He knew not justice , and he laugh 'd at law ;</l>
     <l n="42">On all he mark 'd , he stretch 'd his ready hand ;</l>
     <l n="43">He fish 'd by water and he filch 'd by land :</l>
     <l n="44">Oft in the night has Peter dropp 'd his oar ,</l>
     <l n="45">Fled from his boat , and sought for prey on shore ;</l>
     <l n="46">Oft up the hedge-row glided , on his back</l>
     <l n="47">Bearing the orchard 's produce in a sack ,</l>
     <l n="48">Or farm-yard load , tugg 'd fiercely from the stack ;</l>
     <l n="49">And as these wrongs to greater numbers rose ,</l>
     <l n="50">The more he look 'd on all men as his foes .</l>
     <l n="51">He built a mud-wall 'd hovel , where he kept</l>
     <l n="52">His various wealth , and there he oft-times slept ;</l>
     <l n="53">But no success could please his cruel soul ,</l>
     <l n="54">He wish 'd for one to trouble and control ;</l>
     <l n="55">He wanted some obedient boy to stand</l>
     <l n="56">And bear the blow of his outrageous hand ;</l>
     <l n="57">And hoped to find in some propitious hour</l>
     <l n="58">A feeling creature subject to his power .</l>
     <l n="59">Peter had heard there were in London then , -</l>
     <l n="60">Still have they being !— workhouse-clearing men ,</l>
     <l n="61">Who , undisturb 'd by feelings just or kind ,</l>
     <l n="62">Would parish-boys to needy tradesmen bind :</l>
     <l n="63">They in their want a trifling sum would take ,</l>
     <l n="64">And toiling slaves of piteous orphans make .</l>
     <l n="65">Such Peter sought , and when a lad was found ,</l>
     <l n="66">The sum was dealt him , and the slave was bound .</l>
     <l n="67">Some few in town observed in Peter 's trap</l>
     <l n="68">A boy , with jacket blue and woollen cap ;</l>
     <l n="69">But none inquired how Peter used the rope ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or what the bruise that made the stripling stoop ;</l>
     <l n="71">None could the ridges on his back behold ,</l>
     <l n="72">None sought him shiv'ring in the winter 's cold ;</l>
     <l n="73">None put the question ,— “ Peter , dost thou give</l>
     <l n="74">The boy his food ?— What , man ! the lad must live :</l>
     <l n="75">Consider , Peter , let the child have bread ,</l>
     <l n="76">He 'll serve the better if he 's stroked and fed . ”</l>
     <l n="77">None reason 'd thus — and some , on hearing cries ,</l>
     <l n="78">Said calmly , “ Grimes is at his exercise . ”</l>
     <l n="79">Pinn 'd , beaten , cold , pinch 'd , threaten 'd , and abused -</l>
     <l n="80">His efforts punish 'd and his food refused , -</l>
     <l n="81">Awake tormented ,— soon aroused from sleep , -</l>
     <l n="82">Struck if he wept , and yet compell 'd to weep ,</l>
     <l n="83">The trembling boy dropp 'd down and strove to pray ,</l>
     <l n="84">Received a blow , and trembling turn 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="85">Or sobb 'd and hid his piteous face ;— while he ,</l>
     <l n="86">The savage master , grinn 'd in horrid glee :</l>
     <l n="87">He 'd now the power he ever loved to show ,</l>
     <l n="88">A feeling being subject to his blow .</l>
     <l n="89">Thus lived the lad , in hunger , peril , pain ,</l>
     <l n="90">His tears despised , his supplications vain :</l>
     <l n="91">Compe'lld by fear to lie , by need to steal ,</l>
     <l n="92">His bed uneasy and unbless 'd his meal ,</l>
     <l n="93">For three sad years the boy his tortures bore ,</l>
     <l n="94">And then his pains and trials were no more .</l>
     <l n="95">“ How died he , Peter ? ” when the people said ,</l>
     <l n="96">He growl 'd — “ I found him lifeless in his bed ; ”</l>
     <l n="97">Then tried for softer tone , and sigh 'd , “ Poor Sam is dead . ”</l>
     <l n="98">Yet murmurs were there , and some questions ask 'd -</l>
     <l n="99">How he was fed , how punish 'd , and how task 'd ?</l>
     <l n="100">Much they suspected , but they little proved ,</l>
     <l n="101">And Peter pass 'd untroubled and unmoved .</l>
     <l n="102">Another boy with equal ease was found ,</l>
     <l n="103">The money granted , and the victim bound ;</l>
     <l n="104">And what his fate ?— One night it chanced he fell</l>
     <l n="105">From the boat 's mast and perish 'd in her well ,</l>
     <l n="106">Where fish were living kept , and where the boy</l>
     <l n="107">( So reason 'd men ) could not himself destroy : -</l>
     <l n="108">“ Yes ! so it was ” said Peter , “ in his play ,</l>
     <l n="109">( For he was idle both by night and day ,)</l>
     <l n="110">He climb 'd the main-mast and then fell below ; ” -</l>
     <l n="111">Then show 'd his corpse , and pointed to the blow .</l>
     <l n="112">“ What said the jury ? ” — they were long in doubt ,</l>
     <l n="113">But sturdy Peter faced the matter out :</l>
     <l n="114">So they dismissed him , saying at the time ,</l>
     <l n="115">“ Keep fast your hatchway when you 've boys who climb . ”</l>
     <l n="116">This hit the conscience , and he colour 'd more</l>
     <l n="117">Than for the closest questions put before .</l>
     <l n="118">Thus all his fears the verdict set aside ,</l>
     <l n="119">And at the slave-shop Peter still applied .</l>
     <l n="120">Then came a boy , of manners soft and mild , -</l>
     <l n="121">Our seamen 's wives with grief beheld the child ;</l>
     <l n="122">All thought ( the poor themselves ) that he was one</l>
     <l n="123">Of gentle blood , some noble sinner 's son ,</l>
     <l n="124">Who had , belike , deceived some humble maid ,</l>
     <l n="125">Whom he had first seduced and then betray 'd : -</l>
     <l n="126">However this , he seem 'd a gracious lad ,</l>
     <l n="127">In grief submissive , and with patience sad .</l>
     <l n="128">Passive he labour 'd , till his slender frame</l>
     <l n="129">Bent with his loads , and he at length was lame :</l>
     <l n="130">Strange that a frame so weak could bear so long</l>
     <l n="131">The grossest insult and the foulest wrong ;</l>
     <l n="132">But there were causes — in the town they gave</l>
     <l n="133">Fire , food , and comfort , to the gentle slave ;</l>
     <l n="134">And though stern Peter , with a cruel hand ,</l>
     <l n="135">And knotted rope , enforced the rude command ,</l>
     <l n="136">Yet he consider 'd what he 'd lately felt ,</l>
     <l n="137">And his vile blows with selfish pity dealt .</l>
     <l n="138">One day such draughts the cruel fisher made ,</l>
     <l n="139">He could not vend them in his borough-trade ,</l>
     <l n="140">But sail 'd for London-mart : the boy was ill ,</l>
     <l n="141">But ever humbled to his master 's will ;</l>
     <l n="142">And on the river , where they smoothly sail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="143">He strove with terror and awhile prevail 'd ;</l>
     <l n="144">But new to danger on the angry sea ,</l>
     <l n="145">He clung affrighten 'd to his master 's knee :</l>
     <l n="146">The boat grew leaky and the wind was strong ,</l>
     <l n="147">Rough was the passage and the time was long ;</l>
     <l n="148">His liquor fail 'd , and Peter 's wrath arose , -</l>
     <l n="149">No more is known — the rest we must suppose ,</l>
     <l n="150">Or learn of Peter : — Peter says , he “ spied</l>
     <l n="151">The stripling 's danger and for harbour tried ;</l>
     <l n="152">Meantime the fish , and then th ’ apprentice died . ”</l>
     <l n="153">The pitying women raised a clamour round ,</l>
     <l n="154">And weeping said , “ Thou hast thy ‘ prentice drown 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="155">Now the stern man was summon 'd to the hall ,</l>
     <l n="156">To tell his tale before the burghers all :</l>
     <l n="157">He gave th ’ account ; profess 'd the lad he loved ,</l>
     <l n="158">And kept his brazen features all unmoved .</l>
     <l n="159">The mayor himself with tone severe replied , -</l>
     <l n="160">“ Henceforth with thee shall never boy abide ;</l>
     <l n="161">Hire thee a freeman , whom thou durst not beat ,</l>
     <l n="162">But who , in thy despite , will sleep and eat :</l>
     <l n="163">Free thou art now !— again shouldst thou appear ,</l>
     <l n="164">Thou'lt find thy sentence , like thy soul , severe . ”</l>
     <l n="165">Alas ! for Peter not a helping hand ,</l>
     <l n="166">So was he hated , could he now command ;</l>
     <l n="167">Alone he row 'd his boat , alone he cast</l>
     <l n="168">His nets beside , or made his anchor fast :</l>
     <l n="169">To hold a rope or hear a curse was none , -</l>
     <l n="170">He toil 'd and rail 'd ; he groan 'd and swore alone .</l>
     <l n="171">Thus by himself compell 'd to live each day ,</l>
     <l n="172">To wait for certain hours the tide 's delay ;</l>
     <l n="173">At the same time the same dull views to see ,</l>
     <l n="174">The bounding marsh-bank and the blighted tree ;</l>
     <l n="175">The water only , when the tides were high ,</l>
     <l n="176">When low , the mud half cover 'd and half-dry ;</l>
     <l n="177">The sun-burnt tar that blisters on the planks ,</l>
     <l n="178">And bank-side stakes in their uneven ranks ;</l>
     <l n="179">Heaps of entangled weeds that slowly float ,</l>
     <l n="180">As the tide rolls by the impeded boat .</l>
     <l n="181">When tides were neap , and , in the sultry day ,</l>
     <l n="182">Through the tall bounding mud-banks made their way ,</l>
     <l n="183">Which on each side rose swelling , and below</l>
     <l n="184">The dark warm flood ran silently and slow ;</l>
     <l n="185">There anchoring , Peter chose from man to hide ,</l>
     <l n="186">There hang his head , and view the lazy tide</l>
     <l n="187">In its hot slimy channel slowly glide ;</l>
     <l n="188">Where the small eels that left the deeper way</l>
     <l n="189">For the warm shore , within the shallows play ;</l>
     <l n="190">Where gaping mussels , left upon the mud ,</l>
     <l n="191">Slope their slow passage to the fallen flood ; -</l>
     <l n="192">Here dull and hopeless he 'd lie down and trace</l>
     <l n="193">How sidelong crabs had scrawi 'd their crooked race ,</l>
     <l n="194">Or sadly listen to the tuneless cry</l>
     <l n="195">Of fishing gull or clanging golden-eye ;</l>
     <l n="196">What time the sea-birds to the marsh would come .</l>
     <l n="197">And the loud bittern , from the bull-rush home ,</l>
     <l n="198">Gave from the salt ditch side the bellowing boom :</l>
     <l n="199">He nursed the feelings these dull scenes produce ,</l>
     <l n="200">And loved to stop beside the opening sluice ;</l>
     <l n="201">Where the small stream , confined in narrow bound ,</l>
     <l n="202">Ran with a dull , unvaried , sadd'ning sound ;</l>
     <l n="203">Where all , presented to the eye or ear ,</l>
     <l n="204">Oppresss 'd the soul with misery , grief , and fear .</l>
     <l n="205">Besides these objects , there were places three ,</l>
     <l n="206">Which Peter seem 'd with certain dread to see ;</l>
     <l n="207">When he drew near them he would turn from each ,</l>
     <l n="208">And loudly whistle till he pass 'd the reach .</l>
     <l n="209">A change of scene to him brought no relief ,</l>
     <l n="210">In town , ‘ twas plain , men took him for a thief :</l>
     <l n="211">The sailor 's wives would stop him in the street ,</l>
     <l n="212">And say , “ Now , Peter , thou'st no boy to beat ; ”</l>
     <l n="213">Infants at play when they perceived him , ran ,</l>
     <l n="214">Warning each other — “ That 's the wicked man ; ”</l>
     <l n="215">He growl 'd an oath , and in an angry tone</l>
     <l n="216">Cursed the whole place and wish 'd to be alone .</l>
     <l n="217">Alone he was , the same dull scenes in view ,</l>
     <l n="218">And still more gloomy in his sight they grew :</l>
     <l n="219">Though man he hated , yet employ 'd alone</l>
     <l n="220">At bootless labour , he would swear and groan ,</l>
     <l n="221">Cursing the shoals that glided by the spot ,</l>
     <l n="222">And gulls that caught them when his arts could not .</l>
     <l n="223">Cold nervous tremblings shook his sturdy frame ,</l>
     <l n="224">And strange disease — he could n't say the name ;</l>
     <l n="225">Wild were his dreams , and oft he rose in fright ,</l>
     <l n="226">Waked by his view of horrors in the night , -</l>
     <l n="227">Horrors that would the sternest minds amaze ,</l>
     <l n="228">Horrors that demons might be proud to raise :</l>
     <l n="229">And though he felt forsaken , grieved at heart ,</l>
     <l n="230">To think he lived from all mankind apart ;</l>
     <l n="231">Yet , if a man approach 'd , in terrors he would start .</l>
     <l n="232">A winter pass 'd since Peter saw the town ,</l>
     <l n="233">And summer lodgers were again come down ;</l>
     <l n="234">These , idly curious , with their glasses spied</l>
     <l n="235">The ships in bay as anchor 'd for the tide , -</l>
     <l n="236">The river 's craft ,— the bustle of the quay , -</l>
     <l n="237">And sea-port views , which landmen love to see .</l>
     <l n="238">One , up the river , had a man and boat</l>
     <l n="239">Seen day by day , now anchor 'd , now afloat ;</l>
     <l n="240">Fisher he seem 'd , yet used no net nor hook ;</l>
     <l n="241">Of sea-fowl swimming by no heed he took ,</l>
     <l n="242">But on the gliding waves still fix 'd his lazy look :</l>
     <l n="243">At certain stations he would view the stream ,</l>
     <l n="244">As if he stood bewilder 'd in a dream ,</l>
     <l n="245">Or that some power had chain 'd him for a time ,</l>
     <l n="246">To feel a curse or meditate on crime .</l>
     <l n="247">This known , some curious , some in pity went ,</l>
     <l n="248">And others question 'd — “ Wretch , dost thou repent ? ”</l>
     <l n="249">He heard , he trembled , and in fear resign 'd</l>
     <l n="250">His boat : new terror fill 'd his restless mind ;</l>
     <l n="251">Furious he grew , and up the country ran ,</l>
     <l n="252">And there they seized him — a distemper 'd man : -</l>
     <l n="253">Him we received , and to a parish-bed ,</l>
     <l n="254">Follow 'd and cursed , the groaning man was led .</l>
     <l n="255">Here when they saw him , whom they used to shun ,</l>
     <l n="256">A lost , lone man , so harass 'd and undone ;</l>
     <l n="257">Our gentle females , ever prompt to feel ,</l>
     <l n="258">Perceived compassion on their anger steal ;</l>
     <l n="259">His crimes they could not from their memories blot ,</l>
     <l n="260">But they were grieved , and trembled at his lot .</l>
     <l n="261">A priest too came , to whom his words are told ;</l>
     <l n="262">And all the signs they shudder 'd to behold .</l>
     <l n="263">“ Look ! look ! ” they cried ; “ His limbs with horror shake</l>
     <l n="264">And as he grinds his teeth , what noise they make !</l>
     <l n="265">How glare his angry eyes , and yet he 's not awake :</l>
     <l n="266">See ! what cold drops upon his forehead stand ,</l>
     <l n="267">And how he clenches that broad bony hand . ”</l>
     <l n="268">The Priest attending , found he spoke at times</l>
     <l n="269">As one alluding to his fears and crimes ;</l>
     <l n="270">“ It was the fall , ” he mutter 'd , “ I can show</l>
     <l n="271">The manner how ,— I never struck a blow : ” -</l>
     <l n="272">And then aloud ,— “ Unhand me , free my chain ;</l>
     <l n="273">On oath he fell — it struck him to the brain : -</l>
     <l n="274">Why ask my father ?— that old man will swear</l>
     <l n="275">Against my life ; besides , he was n't there :</l>
     <l n="276">What , all agreed ?— Am I to die to-day ? -</l>
     <l n="277">My Lord , in mercy give me time to pray . ”</l>
     <l n="278">Then as they watch 'd him , calmer he became ,</l>
     <l n="279">And grew so weak he could n't move his frame ,</l>
     <l n="280">But murmuring spake — while they could see and hear</l>
     <l n="281">The start of terror and the groan of fear ;</l>
     <l n="282">See the large dew-beads on his forehead rise ,</l>
     <l n="283">And the cold death-drop glaze his sunken eyes :</l>
     <l n="284">Nor yet he died , but with unwonted force</l>
     <l n="285">Seem 'd with some fancied being to discourse :</l>
     <l n="286">He knew not us , or with accustom 'd art</l>
     <l n="287">He hid the knowledge , yet exposed his heart ;</l>
     <l n="288">‘ Twas part confession and the rest defence ,</l>
     <l n="289">A madman 's tale , with gleams of waking sense .</l>
     <l n="290">“ I 'll tell you all , ” he said , “ The very day</l>
     <l n="291">When the old man first placed them in my way :</l>
     <l n="292">My father 's spirit — he who always tried</l>
     <l n="293">To give me trouble , when he lived and died -</l>
     <l n="294">When he was gone he could not be content</l>
     <l n="295">To see my days in painful labour spent ,</l>
     <l n="296">But would appoint his meetings , and he made</l>
     <l n="297">Me watch at these , and so neglect my trade .</l>
     <l n="298">“ ‘ Twas one hot noon , all silent , still , serene ,</l>
     <l n="299">No living being had I lately seen ;</l>
     <l n="300">I paddled up and down and dipp 'd my net ,</l>
     <l n="301">But ( such his pleasure ) I could nothing get , -</l>
     <l n="302">A father 's pleasure , when his toil was done ,</l>
     <l n="303">To plague and torture thus an only son !</l>
     <l n="304">And so I sat and look 'd upon the stream ,</l>
     <l n="305">How it ran on and felt as in a dream :</l>
     <l n="306">But dream it was not : No !— I fix 'd my eyes</l>
     <l n="307">On the mid stream and saw the spirits rise :</l>
     <l n="308">I saw my father on the water stand ,</l>
     <l n="309">And hold a thin pale boy in either hand ;</l>
     <l n="310">And there they glided ghastly on the top</l>
     <l n="311">Of the salt flood , and never touch 'd a drop :</l>
     <l n="312">I would have struck them , but they knew th ’ intent ,</l>
     <l n="313">And smiled upon the oar , and down they went .</l>
     <l n="314">“ Now , from that day , whenever I began</l>
     <l n="315">To dip my net , there stood the hard old man -</l>
     <l n="316">He and those boys : I humbled me and pray 'd</l>
     <l n="317">They would be gone ; they heeded not , but stay 'd :</l>
     <l n="318">Nor could I turn , nor would the boat go by ,</l>
     <l n="319">But , gazing on the spirits , there was I :</l>
     <l n="320">They bade me leap to death , but I was loth to die :</l>
     <l n="321">And every day , as sure as day arose ,</l>
     <l n="322">Would these three spirits meet me ere the close ;</l>
     <l n="323">To hear and mark them daily was my doom ,</l>
     <l n="324">And ‘ Come , ’ they said , with weak , sad voices , ‘ Come . ’</l>
     <l n="325">To row away , with all my strength I tried ,</l>
     <l n="326">But there were they hard by me in the tide ,</l>
     <l n="327">The three unbodied forms — and ‘ Come , still come , ’ they cried .</l>
     <l n="328">“ Fathers should pity — but this old man shook</l>
     <l n="329">His hoary locks , and froze me by a look :</l>
     <l n="330">Thrice when I struck them , through the water came</l>
     <l n="331">A hollow groan , that weaken 'd all my frame :</l>
     <l n="332">‘ Father ! ’ said I , ‘ Have mercy : ’ he replied ,</l>
     <l n="333">I know not what — the angry spirit lied , -</l>
     <l n="334">‘ Didst thou not draw thy knife ? ’ said he : — ‘ Twas true ,</l>
     <l n="335">But I had pity and my arm withdrew :</l>
     <l n="336">He cried for mercy , which I kindly gave ,</l>
     <l n="337">But he has no compassion in his grave .</l>
     <l n="338">“ There were three places , where they ever rose , -</l>
     <l n="339">The whole long river has not such as those -</l>
     <l n="340">Places accursed , where , if a man remain ,</l>
     <l n="341">He 'll see the things which strike him to the brain ;</l>
     <l n="342">And there they made me on my paddle lean ,</l>
     <l n="343">And look at them for hours ;— accursed scene !</l>
     <l n="344">When they would glide to that smooth eddy-space ,</l>
     <l n="345">Then bid me leap and join them in the place ;</l>
     <l n="346">And at my groans each little villain sprite</l>
     <l n="347">Enjoy 'd my pains and vanish 'd in delight .</l>
     <l n="348">“ In one fierce summer-day , when my poor brain</l>
     <l n="349">Was burning hot , and cruel was my pain ,</l>
     <l n="350">Then came this father-foe , and there he stood</l>
     <l n="351">With his two boys again upon the flood :</l>
     <l n="352">There was more mischief in their eyes , more glee</l>
     <l n="353">In their pale faces , when they glared at me :</l>
     <l n="354">Still they did force me on the oar to rest ,</l>
     <l n="355">And when they saw me fainting and oppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="356">He with his hand , the old man , scoop 'd the flood ,</l>
     <l n="357">And there came flame about him mix 'd with blood ;</l>
     <l n="358">He bade me stoop and look upon the place ,</l>
     <l n="359">Then flung the hot-red liquor in my face ;</l>
     <l n="360">Burning it blazed , and then I roar 'd for pain ,</l>
     <l n="361">I thought the demons would have turn 'd my brain .</l>
     <l n="362">“ Still there they stood , and forced me to behold</l>
     <l n="363">A place of horrors — they can not be told -</l>
     <l n="364">Where the flood open 'd , there I heard the shriek</l>
     <l n="365">Of tortured guilt — no earthly tongue can speak :</l>
     <l n="366">‘ All days alike ! for ever ! ’ did they say ,</l>
     <l n="367">‘ And unremitted torments every day ’ -</l>
     <l n="368">Yes , so they said ” — But here he ceased and gazed</l>
     <l n="369">On all around , affrighten 'd and amazed ;</l>
     <l n="370">And still he tried to speak , and look 'd in dread</l>
     <l n="371">Of frighten 'd females gathering round his bed ;</l>
     <l n="372">Then dropp 'd exhausted , and appear 'd at rest ,</l>
     <l n="373">Till the strong foe the vital powers possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="374">Then with an inward , broken voice he cried ,</l>
     <l n="375">“ Again they come ! ” and mutter 'd as he died . { 13 }</l>

    <head>PRISONS . { 14 }</head>
    <head>The Mind of Man accommodates itself to all Situations ; Prisons otherwise would be intolerable — Debtors : their different kinds : three particularly described ; others more briefly — An arrested Prisoner : his Account of his Feelings and his Situation — The Alleviations of a Prison — Prisoners for Crimes — Two Condemned : a vindictive Female : a Highwayman — The Interval between Condemnation and Execution — His Feelings as the Time approaches — His Dream .</head>
     <l n="1">‘ TIS well — that Man to all the varying states</l>
     <l n="2">Of good and ill his mind accommodates ;</l>
     <l n="3">He not alone progressive grief sustains ,</l>
     <l n="4">But soon submits to unexperienced pains :</l>
     <l n="5">Change after change , all climes his body bears ;</l>
     <l n="6">His mind repeated shocks of changing cares :</l>
     <l n="7">Faith and fair Virtue arm the nobler breast ;</l>
     <l n="8">Hope and mere want of feeling aid the rest .</l>
     <l n="9">Or who could bear to lose the balmy air</l>
     <l n="10">Of summer 's breath , from all things fresh and fair ,</l>
     <l n="11">With all that man admires or loves below ;</l>
     <l n="12">All earth and water , wood and vale bestow ,</l>
     <l n="13">Where rosy pleasures smile , whence real blessings flow ;</l>
     <l n="14">With sight and sound of every kind that lives ,</l>
     <l n="15">And crowning all with joy that freedom gives ?</l>
     <l n="16">Who could from these , in some unhappy day ,</l>
     <l n="17">Bear to be drawn by ruthless arms away ,</l>
     <l n="18">To the vile nuisance of a noisome room ,</l>
     <l n="19">Where only insolence and misery come ?</l>
     <l n="20">( Save that the curious will by chance appear ,</l>
     <l n="21">Or some in pity drop a fruitless tear ) ;</l>
     <l n="22">To a damp Prison , where the very sight</l>
     <l n="23">Of the warm sun is favour and not right ;</l>
     <l n="24">Where all we hear or see the feelings shock ,</l>
     <l n="25">The oath and groan , the fetter and the lock ?</l>
     <l n="26">Who could bear this and live ?— Oh ! many a year</l>
     <l n="27">All this is borne , and miseries more severe ;</l>
     <l n="28">And some there are , familiar with the scene ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who live in mirth , though few become serene .</l>
     <l n="30">Far as I might the inward man perceive ,</l>
     <l n="31">There was a constant effort — not to grieve :</l>
     <l n="32">Not to despair , for better days would come ,</l>
     <l n="33">And the freed debtor smile again at home :</l>
     <l n="34">Subdued his habits , he may peace regain ,</l>
     <l n="35">And bless the woes that were not sent in vain .</l>
     <l n="36">Thus might we class the Debtors here confined ,</l>
     <l n="37">The more deceived , the more deceitful kind ;</l>
     <l n="38">Here are the guilty race , who mean to live</l>
     <l n="39">On credit , that credulity will give ;</l>
     <l n="40">Who purchase , conscious they can never pay ;</l>
     <l n="41">Who know their fate , and traffic to betray ;</l>
     <l n="42">On whom no pity , fear , remorse , prevail .</l>
     <l n="43">Their aim a statute , their resource a jail ; -</l>
     <l n="44">These are the public spoilers we regard ,</l>
     <l n="45">No dun so harsh , no creditor so hard .</l>
     <l n="46">A second kind are they , who truly strive</l>
     <l n="47">To keep their sinking credit long alive ;</l>
     <l n="48">Success , nay prudence , they may want , but yet</l>
     <l n="49">They would be solvent , and deplore a debt ;</l>
     <l n="50">All means they use , to all expedients run ,</l>
     <l n="51">And are by slow , sad steps , at last undone :</l>
     <l n="52">Justly , perhaps , you blame their want of skill ,</l>
     <l n="53">But mourn their feelings and absolve their will .</l>
     <l n="54">There is a Debtor , who his trifling all</l>
     <l n="55">Spreads in a shop ; it would not fill a stall :</l>
     <l n="56">There at one window his temptation lays ,</l>
     <l n="57">And in new modes disposes and displays :</l>
     <l n="58">Above the door you shall his name behold ,</l>
     <l n="59">And what he vends in ample letters told ,</l>
     <l n="60">The words ‘ Repository , ’ ‘ Warehouse , ’ all</l>
     <l n="61">He uses to enlarge concerns so small :</l>
     <l n="62">He to his goods assigns some beauty 's name ,</l>
     <l n="63">Then in her reign , and hopes they 'll share her fame ,</l>
     <l n="64">And talks of credit , commerce , traffic , trade ,</l>
     <l n="65">As one important by their profit made ;</l>
     <l n="66">But who can paint the vacancy , the gloom ,</l>
     <l n="67">And spare dimensions of one backward room ?</l>
     <l n="68">Wherein he dines , if so ‘ tis fit to speak</l>
     <l n="69">Of one day 's herring and the morrow 's steak :</l>
     <l n="70">An anchorite in diet , all his care</l>
     <l n="71">Is to display his stock and vend his ware .</l>
     <l n="72">Long waiting hopeless , then he tries to meet</l>
     <l n="73">A kinder fortune in a distant street ;</l>
     <l n="74">There he again displays , increasing yet</l>
     <l n="75">Corroding sorrow and consuming debt :</l>
     <l n="76">Alas ! he wants the requisites to rise -</l>
     <l n="77">The true connections , the availing ties :</l>
     <l n="78">They who proceed on certainties advance ,</l>
     <l n="79">These are not times when men prevail by chance ;</l>
     <l n="80">But still he tries , till , after years of pain ,</l>
     <l n="81">He finds , with anguish , he has tried in vain .</l>
     <l n="82">Debtors are these on whom ‘ tis hard to press ,</l>
     <l n="83">‘ Tis base , impolitic , and merciless .</l>
     <l n="84">To these we add a miscellaneous kind ,</l>
     <l n="85">By pleasure , pride , and indolence confined ;</l>
     <l n="86">Those whom no calls , no warnings could divert ,</l>
     <l n="87">The unexperienced , and the inexpert ;</l>
     <l n="88">The builder , idler , schemer , gamester , sot , -</l>
     <l n="89">The follies different , but the same their lot ;</l>
     <l n="90">Victims of horses , lasses , drinking , dice ,</l>
     <l n="91">Of every passion , humour , whim , and vice .</l>
     <l n="92">See ! that sad Merchant , who but yesterday</l>
     <l n="93">Had a vast household in command and pay ;</l>
     <l n="94">He now entreats permission to employ</l>
     <l n="95">A boy he needs , and then entreats the boy .</l>
     <l n="96">And there sits one improvident but kind ,</l>
     <l n="97">Bound for a friend , whom honour could not bind ;</l>
     <l n="98">Sighing , he speaks to any who appear ,</l>
     <l n="99">“ A treach'rous friend — ‘ twas that which sent me here :</l>
     <l n="100">I was too kind ,— I thought I could depend</l>
     <l n="101">On his bare word — he was a treach'rous friend . ”</l>
     <l n="102">A Female too !— it is to her a home ,</l>
     <l n="103">She came before — and she again will come :</l>
     <l n="104">Her friends have pity ; when their anger drops ,</l>
     <l n="105">They take her home ;— she 's tried her schools and shops -</l>
     <l n="106">Plan after plan ;— but fortune would not mend ,</l>
     <l n="107">She to herself was still the treach'rous friend ;</l>
     <l n="108">And wheresoe'er began , all here was sure to end :</l>
     <l n="109">And there she sits , as thoughtless and as gay</l>
     <l n="110">As if she 'd means , or not a debt to pay -</l>
     <l n="111">Or knew to-morrow she 'd be call 'd away -</l>
     <l n="112">Or felt a shilling and could dine to-day .</l>
     <l n="113">While thus observing , I began to trace</l>
     <l n="114">The sober 'd features of a well-known face -</l>
     <l n="115">Looks once familiar , manners form 'd to please ,</l>
     <l n="116">And all illumined by a heart at ease :</l>
     <l n="117">But fraud and flattery ever claim 'd a part</l>
     <l n="118">( Still unresisted ) of that easy heart ;</l>
     <l n="119">But he at length beholds me — “ Ah ! my friend !</l>
     <l n="120">“ And have thy pleasures this unlucky end ? ”</l>
     <l n="121">“ Too sure , ” he said , and smiling as he sigh 'd ;</l>
     <l n="122">“ I went astray , though Prudence seem 'd my guide ;</l>
     <l n="123">All she proposed I in my heart approved ,</l>
     <l n="124">And she was honour 'd , but my pleasure loved -</l>
     <l n="125">Pleasure , the mistress to whose arms I fled ,</l>
     <l n="126">From wife-like lectures angry Prudence read .</l>
     <l n="127">“ Why speak the madness of a life like mine ,</l>
     <l n="128">The powers of beauty , novelty , and wine ?</l>
     <l n="129">Why paint the wanton smile , the venal vow ,</l>
     <l n="130">Or friends whose worth I can appreciate now ;</l>
     <l n="131">Oft I perceived my fate , and then could say ,</l>
     <l n="132">I 'll think to-morrow , I must live to-day :</l>
     <l n="133">So am I here — I own the laws are just -</l>
     <l n="134">And here , where thought is painful , think I must :</l>
     <l n="135">But speech is pleasant ; this discourse with thee</l>
     <l n="136">Brings to my mind the sweets of liberty ,</l>
     <l n="137">Breaks on the sameness of the place , and gives</l>
     <l n="138">The doubtful heart conviction that it lives .</l>
     <l n="139">“ Let me describe my anguish in the hour</l>
     <l n="140">When law detain 'd me and I felt its power .</l>
     <l n="141">“ When , in that shipwreck , this I found my shore ,</l>
     <l n="142">And join 'd the wretched , who were wreck 'd before ;</l>
     <l n="143">When I perceived each feature in the face ,</l>
     <l n="144">Pinch 'd through neglect or turbid by disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="145">When in these wasting forms affliction stood</l>
     <l n="146">In my afiiicted view , it chill 'd my blood ; -</l>
     <l n="147">And forth I rush 'd , a quick retreat to make ,</l>
     <l n="148">Till a loud laugh proclaim 'd the dire mistake :</l>
     <l n="149">But when the groan had settled to a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="150">When gloom became familiar to the eye ,</l>
     <l n="151">When I perceive how others seem to rest ,</l>
     <l n="152">With every evil rankling in my breast , -</l>
     <l n="153">Led by example , I put on the man ,</l>
     <l n="154">Sing off my sighs , and trifle as I can .</l>
     <l n="155">“ Homer ! nay Pope ! ( for never will I seek</l>
     <l n="156">Applause for learning — nought have I with Greek )</l>
     <l n="157">Gives us the secrets of his pagan hell ,</l>
     <l n="158">Where ghost with ghost in sad communion dwell ;</l>
     <l n="159">Where shade meets shade , and round the gloomy meads</l>
     <l n="160">They glide , and speak of old heroic deeds , -</l>
     <l n="161">What fields they conquer 'd , and what foes they slew ,</l>
     <l n="162">And sent to join the melancholy crew .</l>
     <l n="163">When a new spirit in that world was found ,</l>
     <l n="164">A thousand shadowy forms came flitting round :</l>
     <l n="165">Those who had known him , fond inquiries made , -</l>
     <l n="166">‘ Of all we left , inform us , gentle shade ,</l>
     <l n="167">Now as we lead thee in our realms to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="168">Our twilight groves , and meads of asphodel . ’</l>
     <l n="169">“ What paints the poet , is our station here ,</l>
     <l n="170">Where we like ghosts and flitting shades appear :</l>
     <l n="171">This is the hell he sings , and here we meet ,</l>
     <l n="172">And former deeds to new-made friends repeat ;</l>
     <l n="173">Heroic deeds , which here obtain us fame ,</l>
     <l n="174">And are in fact the causes why we came :</l>
     <l n="175">Yes ! this dim region is old Homer 's hell ,</l>
     <l n="176">Abate but groves and meads of asphodel .</l>
     <l n="177">Here , when a stranger from your world we spy ,</l>
     <l n="178">We gather round him and for news apply ;</l>
     <l n="179">He hears unheeding , nor can speech endure ,</l>
     <l n="180">But shivering gazes on the vast obscure :</l>
     <l n="181">We smiling pity , and by kindness show</l>
     <l n="182">We felt his feelings and his terrors know ;</l>
     <l n="183">Then speak of comfort — time will give him sight ,</l>
     <l n="184">Where now ‘ tis dark ; where now ‘ tis woe — delight .</l>
     <l n="185">‘ Have hope , ’ we say , ‘ and soon the place to thee</l>
     <l n="186">Shall not a prison but a castle be :</l>
     <l n="187">When to the wretch whom care and guilt confound ,</l>
     <l n="188">The world 's a prison , with a wider bound ;</l>
     <l n="189">Go where he may , he feels himself confined ,</l>
     <l n="190">And wears the fetters of an abject mind . ’</l>
     <l n="191">“ But now adieu ! those giant-keys appear ,</l>
     <l n="192">Thou art not worthy to be inmate here :</l>
     <l n="193">Go to thy world , and to the young declare</l>
     <l n="194">What we , our spirits and employments , are ;</l>
     <l n="195">Tell them how we the ills of life endure ,</l>
     <l n="196">Our empire stable , and our state secure ;</l>
     <l n="197">Our dress , our diet , for their use describe ,</l>
     <l n="198">And bid them haste to join the gen'rous tribe :</l>
     <l n="199">Go to thy world , and leave us here to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="200">Who to its joys and comforts bid farewell . ”</l>
     <l n="201">Farewell to these ; but other scenes I view ,</l>
     <l n="202">And other griefs , and guilt of deeper hue ;</l>
     <l n="203">Where Conscience gives to outward ills her pain ,</l>
     <l n="204">Gloom to the night , and pressure to the chain :</l>
     <l n="205">Here separate cells awhile in misery keep</l>
     <l n="206">Two doom 'd to suffer : there they strive for sleep ;</l>
     <l n="207">By day indulged , in larger space they range ,</l>
     <l n="208">Their bondage certain , but their bounds have change .</l>
     <l n="209">One was a female , who had grievous ill</l>
     <l n="210">Wrought in revenge , and she enjoy 'd it still :</l>
     <l n="211">With death before her , and her fate in view ,</l>
     <l n="212">Unsated vengeance in her bosom grew :</l>
     <l n="213">Sullen she was and threat'ning ; in her eye</l>
     <l n="214">Glared the stern triumph that she dared to die :</l>
     <l n="215">But first a being in the world must leave -</l>
     <l n="216">‘ Twas once reproach ; ‘ twas now a short reprieve .</l>
     <l n="217">She was a pauper bound , who early gave</l>
     <l n="218">Her mind to vice and doubly was a slave :</l>
     <l n="219">Upbraided , beaten , held by rough control ,</l>
     <l n="220">Revenge sustain 'd , inspired , and fill 'd her soul :</l>
     <l n="221">She fired a full-stored barn , confess 'd the fact ,</l>
     <l n="222">And laugh 'd at law and justified the act :</l>
     <l n="223">Our gentle Vicar tried his powers in vain ,</l>
     <l n="224">She answer 'd not , or answer 'd with disdain ;</l>
     <l n="225">Th ’ approaching fate she heard without a sigh ,</l>
     <l n="226">And neither cared to live nor fear 'd to die .</l>
     <l n="227">Not so he felt , who with her was to pay</l>
     <l n="228">The forfeit , life — with dread he view 'd the day ,</l>
     <l n="229">And that short space which yet for him remain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="230">Till with his limbs his faculties were chain 'd :</l>
     <l n="231">He paced his narrow bounds some ease to find ,</l>
     <l n="232">But found it not ,— no comfort reach 'd his mind :</l>
     <l n="233">Each sense was palsied ; when he tasted food ,</l>
     <l n="234">He sigh 'd and said , “ Enough — ‘ tis very good . ”</l>
     <l n="235">Since his dread sentence , nothing seem 'd to be</l>
     <l n="236">As once it was — he seeing could not see ,</l>
     <l n="237">Nor hearing , hear aright ;— when first I came</l>
     <l n="238">Within his view , I fancied there was shame ,</l>
     <l n="239">I judged resentment ; I mistook the air , -</l>
     <l n="240">These fainter passions live not with despair ;</l>
     <l n="241">Or but exist and die : — Hope , fear , and love ,</l>
     <l n="242">Joy , doubt , and hate , may other spirits move ,</l>
     <l n="243">But touch not his , who every waking hour</l>
     <l n="244">Has one fix 'd dread , and always feels its power .</l>
     <l n="245">“ But will not mercy ? ” — No ! she cannot plead</l>
     <l n="246">For such an outrage ;— ‘ twas a cruel deed :</l>
     <l n="247">He stopp 'd a timid traveller ;— to his breast ,</l>
     <l n="248">With oaths and curses , was the danger press 'd : -</l>
     <l n="249">No ! he must suffer : pity we may find</l>
     <l n="250">For one man 's pangs , but must not wrong mankind .</l>
     <l n="251">Still I behold him , every thought employ 'd</l>
     <l n="252">On one dire view !— all others are destroy 'd ;</l>
     <l n="253">This makes his features ghastly , gives the tone</l>
     <l n="254">Of his few words resemblance to a groan ;</l>
     <l n="255">He takes his tasteless food , and when ‘ tis done ,</l>
     <l n="256">Counts up his meals , now lessen 'd by that one ;</l>
     <l n="257">For expectation is on time intent ,</l>
     <l n="258">Whether he brings us joy or punishment .</l>
     <l n="259">Yes ! e'en in sleep the impressions all remain ,</l>
     <l n="260">He hears the sentence and he feels the chain ;</l>
     <l n="261">He sees the judge and jury , when he shakes ,</l>
     <l n="262">And loudly cries , “ Not guilty , ” and awakes :</l>
     <l n="263">Then chilling tremblings o'er his body creep ,</l>
     <l n="264">Till worn-out nature is compell 'd to sleep .</l>
     <l n="265">Now comes the dream again : it shows each scene ,</l>
     <l n="266">With each small circumstance that comes between -</l>
     <l n="267">The call to suffering and the very deed -</l>
     <l n="268">There crowds go with him , follow , and precede ;</l>
     <l n="269">Some heartless shout , some pity , all condemn ,</l>
     <l n="270">While he in fancied envy looks at them :</l>
     <l n="271">He seems the place for that sad act to see ,</l>
     <l n="272">And dreams the very thirst which then will be :</l>
     <l n="273">A priest attends — it seems , the one he knew</l>
     <l n="274">In his best days , beneath whose care he grew .</l>
     <l n="275">At this his terrors take a sudden flight ,</l>
     <l n="276">He sees his native village with delight ;</l>
     <l n="277">The house , the chamber , where he once array 'd</l>
     <l n="278">His youthful person ; where he knelt and pray 'd :</l>
     <l n="279">Then too the comforts he enjoy 'd at home ,</l>
     <l n="280">The days of joy ; the joys themselves are come ; -</l>
     <l n="281">The hours of innocence ;— the timid look</l>
     <l n="282">Of his loved maid , when first her hand he took ,</l>
     <l n="283">And told his hope ; her trembling joy appears ,</l>
     <l n="284">Her forced reserve and his retreating fears .</l>
     <l n="285">All now is present ;— ‘ tis a moment 's gleam</l>
     <l n="286">Of former sunshine — stay , delightful dream !</l>
     <l n="287">Let him within his pleasant garden walk ,</l>
     <l n="288">Give him her arm , of blessings let them talk .</l>
     <l n="289">Yes ! all are with him now , and all the while</l>
     <l n="290">Life 's early prospects and his Fanny 's smile :</l>
     <l n="291">Then come his sister and his village-friend ,</l>
     <l n="292">And he will now the sweetest moments spend</l>
     <l n="293">Life has to yield ;— No ! never will he find</l>
     <l n="294">Again on earth such pleasure in his mind :</l>
     <l n="295">He goes through shrubby walks these friends among ,</l>
     <l n="296">Love in their looks and honour on the tongue :</l>
     <l n="297">Nay , there 's a charm beyond what nature shows ,</l>
     <l n="298">The bloom is softer and more sweetly glows ; -</l>
     <l n="299">Pierced by no crime , and urged by no desire</l>
     <l n="300">For more than true and honest hearts require ,</l>
     <l n="301">They feel the calm delight , and thus proceed</l>
     <l n="302">Through the green lane ,— then linger in the mead , -</l>
     <l n="303">Stray o'er the heath in all its purple bloom , -</l>
     <l n="304">And pluck the blossom where the wild bees hum ;</l>
     <l n="305">Then through the broomy bound with ease they pass ,</l>
     <l n="306">And press the sandy sheep-walk 's slender grass ,</l>
     <l n="307">Where dwarfish flowers among the gorse are spread ,</l>
     <l n="308">And the lamb browses by the linnet 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="309">Then ‘ cross the bounding brook they make their way</l>
     <l n="310">O'er its rough bridge — and there behold the bay ! -</l>
     <l n="311">The ocean smiling to the fervid sun -</l>
     <l n="312">The waves that faintly fall and slowly run -</l>
     <l n="313">The ships at distance and the boats at hand ;</l>
     <l n="314">And now they walk upon the sea-side sand ,</l>
     <l n="315">Counting the number and what kind they be ,</l>
     <l n="316">Ships softly sinking in the sleepy sea :</l>
     <l n="317">Now arm in arm , now parted , they behold</l>
     <l n="318">The glitt'ring waters on the shingles roll 'd :</l>
     <l n="319">The timid girls , half dreading their design ,</l>
     <l n="320">Dip the small foot in the retarded brine ,</l>
     <l n="321">And search for crimson weeds , which spreading flow ,</l>
     <l n="322">Or lie like pictures on the sand below ;</l>
     <l n="323">With all those bright red pebbles , that the sun</l>
     <l n="324">Through the small waves so softly shines upon ;</l>
     <l n="325">And those live lucid jellies which the eye</l>
     <l n="326">Delights to trace as they swim glittering by :</l>
     <l n="327">Pearl-shells and rubied star-fish they admire ,</l>
     <l n="328">And will arrange above the parlour fire , -</l>
     <l n="329">Tokens of bliss !— “ Oh ! horrible ! a wave</l>
     <l n="330">Roars as it rises — save me , Edward ! save ! ”</l>
     <l n="331">She cries : — Alas ! the watchman on his way</l>
     <l n="332">Calls , and lets in — truth , terror , and the day !</l>

   <p>LETTER XXIV .</p>
   <p>Be it a weakness , it deserves some praise , -  We love the play-place of our early days ; The scene is touching , and the heart is stone That feels not at that sight — and feels at none . The wall on which we tried our graving skill ; The very name we carved subsisting still ; The bench on which we sat while deep employ 'd , Though mangled , hack 'd , and hew 'd , yet not destroy 'd . The little ones unbutton 'd , glowing hot , Playing our games , and on the very spot ; As happy as we once to kneel and draw The chalky ring and knuckle down at taw . This fond detachment to the well known place , When first we started into life 's long race , Maintains its hold with such unfailing sway , We feel it e'en in age and at our latest day . COWPER .</p>
   <p>Tu quoque ne metuas , quamvis schola verbere multo Increpet et truculenta senex geret ora magister ; Degeneres animos timor arguit ; at tibi consta Intrepidus , nec te clamor plagaeque sonantes , Nec matutinis agitet formido sub horis , Quod sceptrum vibrat ferulae , quod multa supellex Virgea , quod molis scuticam praetexit aluta , Quod fervent trepido subsellia vestra tumultu , Pompa loci , et vani fugiatur scena timoris . AUSONIUS .</p>

     <l n="13">To every class we have a School assign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="14">Rules for all ranks and food for every mind :</l>
     <l n="15">Yet one there is , that small regard to rule</l>
     <l n="16">Or study pays , and still is deem 'd a School :</l>
     <l n="17">That , where a deaf , poor , patient widow sits ,</l>
     <l n="18">And awes some thirty infants as she knits ;</l>
     <l n="19">Infants of humble , busy wives , who pay</l>
     <l n="20">Some trifling price for freedom through the day :</l>
     <l n="21">At this good matron 's hut the children meet ,</l>
     <l n="22">Who thus becomes the mother of the street :</l>
     <l n="23">Her room is small they cannot widely stray , -</l>
     <l n="24">Her threshold high they cannot run away :</l>
     <l n="25">Though deaf , she sees the rebel-heroes shout , -</l>
     <l n="26">Though lame , her white rod nimbly walks about ;</l>
     <l n="27">With band of yarn she keeps offenders in ,</l>
     <l n="28">And to her gown the sturdiest rogue can pin :</l>
     <l n="29">Aided by these , and spells , and tell-tale birds ,</l>
     <l n="30">Her power they dread and reverence her words .</l>
     <l n="31">To Learning 's second seats we now proceed ,</l>
     <l n="32">Where humming students gilded primers read ;</l>
     <l n="33">Or books with letters large and pictures gay ,</l>
     <l n="34">To make their reading but a kind of play -</l>
     <l n="35">“ Reading made easy , ” so the titles tell ;</l>
     <l n="36">But they who read must first begin to spell :</l>
     <l n="37">There may be profit in these arts , but still</l>
     <l n="38">Learning is labour , call it what you will ;</l>
     <l n="39">Upon the youthful mind a heavy load ,</l>
     <l n="40">Nor must we hope to find the royal road .</l>
     <l n="41">Some will their easy steps to science show ,</l>
     <l n="42">And some to heav'n itself their by-way know ;</l>
     <l n="43">Ah ! trust them not ,— who fame or bliss would share ,</l>
     <l n="44">Must learn by labour , and must live by care .</l>
     <l n="45">Another matron , of superior kind ,</l>
     <l n="46">For higher schools prepares the rising mind ;</l>
     <l n="47">Preparatory she her Learning calls ,</l>
     <l n="48">The step first made to colleges and halls .</l>
     <l n="49">She early sees to what the mind will grow ,</l>
     <l n="50">Nor abler judge of infant-powers I know :</l>
     <l n="51">She sees what soon the lively will impede ,</l>
     <l n="52">And how the steadier will in turn succeed ;</l>
     <l n="53">Observes the dawn of wisdom , fancy , taste ,</l>
     <l n="54">And knows what parts will wear , and what will waste :</l>
     <l n="55">She marks the mind too lively , and at once</l>
     <l n="56">Sees the gay coxcomb and the rattling dunce .</l>
     <l n="57">Long has she lived , and much she loves to trace</l>
     <l n="58">Her former pupils , now a lordly race ;</l>
     <l n="59">Whom when she sees rich robes and furs bedeck ,</l>
     <l n="60">She marks the pride which once she strove to check .</l>
     <l n="61">A Burgess comes , and she remembers well</l>
     <l n="62">How hard her task to make his worship spell ;</l>
     <l n="63">Cold , selfish , dull , inanimate , unkind ,</l>
     <l n="64">‘ Twas but by anger he display 'd a mind :</l>
     <l n="65">Now civil , smiling , complaisant , and gay ,</l>
     <l n="66">The world has worn th ’ unsocial crust away :</l>
     <l n="67">That sullen spirit now a softness wears ,</l>
     <l n="68">And , save by fits , e'en dulness disappears :</l>
     <l n="69">But still the matron can the man behold ,</l>
     <l n="70">Dull , selfish , hard , inanimate , and cold .</l>
     <l n="71">A Merchant passes ,— “ Probity and truth ,</l>
     <l n="72">Prudence and patience , mark 'd thee from thy youth . ”</l>
     <l n="73">Thus she observes , but oft retains her fears</l>
     <l n="74">For him , who now with name unstain 'd appears :</l>
     <l n="75">Nor hope relinquishes , for one who yet</l>
     <l n="76">Is lost in error and involved in debt ;</l>
     <l n="77">For latent evil in that heart she found ,</l>
     <l n="78">More open here , but here the core was sound .</l>
     <l n="79">Various our Day-Schools : here behold we one</l>
     <l n="80">Empty and still : — the morning duties done ,</l>
     <l n="81">Soil 'd , tatter 'd , worn , and thrown in various heaps ,</l>
     <l n="82">Appear their books , and there confusion sleeps ;</l>
     <l n="83">The workmen all are from the Babel fled ,</l>
     <l n="84">And lost their tools , till the return they dread :</l>
     <l n="85">Meantime the master , with his wig awry ,</l>
     <l n="86">Prepares his books for business by-and-by :</l>
     <l n="87">Now all th ’ insignia of the monarch laid</l>
     <l n="88">Beside him rest , and none stand by afraid ;</l>
     <l n="89">He , while his troop light-hearted leap and play ,</l>
     <l n="90">Is all intent on duties of the day ;</l>
     <l n="91">No more the tyrant stern or judge severe ,</l>
     <l n="92">He feels the father 's and the husband 's fear .</l>
     <l n="93">Ah ! little think the timid trembling crowd ,</l>
     <l n="94">That one so wise , so powerful , and so proud ,</l>
     <l n="95">Should feel himself , and dread the humble ills</l>
     <l n="96">Of rent-day charges , and of coalman 's bills ;</l>
     <l n="97">That while they mercy from their judge implore ,</l>
     <l n="98">He fears himself — a knocking at the door ;</l>
     <l n="99">And feels the burthen as his neighbour states</l>
     <l n="100">His humble portion to the parish-rates .</l>
     <l n="101">They sit th ’ alloted hours , then eager run ,</l>
     <l n="102">Rushing to pleasure when the duty 's done ;</l>
     <l n="103">His hour of leisure is of different kind ,</l>
     <l n="104">Then cares domestic rush upon his mind ,</l>
     <l n="105">And half the ease and comfort he enjoys ,</l>
     <l n="106">Is when surrounded by slates , books , and boys .</l>
     <l n="107">Poor Reuben Dixon has the noisiest school</l>
     <l n="108">Of ragged lads , who ever bow 'd to rule ;</l>
     <l n="109">Low in his price — the men who heave our coals ,</l>
     <l n="110">And clean our causeways , send him boys in shoals ;</l>
     <l n="111">To see poor Reuben , with his fry beside , -</l>
     <l n="112">Their half-check 'd rudeness and his half-scorn 'd pride , -</l>
     <l n="113">Their room , the sty in which th ’ assembly meet ,</l>
     <l n="114">In the close lane behind the Northgate-street ;</l>
     <l n="115">T'observe his vain attempts to keep the peace ,</l>
     <l n="116">Till tolls the bell , and strife and troubles cease , -</l>
     <l n="117">Calls for our praise ; his labour praise deserves ,</l>
     <l n="118">But not our pity ; Reuben has no nerves :</l>
     <l n="119">‘ Mid noise and dirt , and stench , and play , and prate ,</l>
     <l n="120">He calmly cuts the pen or views the slate .</l>
     <l n="121">But Leonard !— yes , for Leonard 's fate I grieve ,</l>
     <l n="122">Who loaths the station which he dares not leave :</l>
     <l n="123">He cannot dig , he will not beg his bread ,</l>
     <l n="124">All his dependence rests upon his head ;</l>
     <l n="125">And deeply skill 'd in sciences and arts ,</l>
     <l n="126">On vulgar lads he wastes superior parts .</l>
     <l n="127">Alas ! what grief that feeling mind sustains ,</l>
     <l n="128">In guiding hands and stirring torpid brains ;</l>
     <l n="129">He whose proud mind from pole to pole will move ,</l>
     <l n="130">And view the wonders of the worlds above ;</l>
     <l n="131">Who thinks and reasons strongly : — hard his fate ,</l>
     <l n="132">Confined for ever to the pen and slate :</l>
     <l n="133">True , he submits , and when the long dull day</l>
     <l n="134">Has slowly pass 'd , in weary tasks , away ,</l>
     <l n="135">To other worlds with cheerful view he looks ,</l>
     <l n="136">And parts the night between repose and books .</l>
     <l n="137">Amid his labours , he has sometimes tried</l>
     <l n="138">To turn a little from his cares aside ;</l>
     <l n="139">Pope , Milton , Dryden , with delight has seized ,</l>
     <l n="140">His soul engaged and of his trouble eased :</l>
     <l n="141">When , with a heavy eye and ill-done sum ,</l>
     <l n="142">No part conceived , a stupid boy will come ;</l>
     <l n="143">Then Leonard first subdues the rising frown ,</l>
     <l n="144">And bids the blockhead lay his blunders down ;</l>
     <l n="145">O'er which disgusted he will turn his eye ,</l>
     <l n="146">To his sad duty his sound mind apply ,</l>
     <l n="147">And , vex 'd in spirit , throw his pleasures by .</l>
     <l n="148">Turn we to Schools which more than these afford -</l>
     <l n="149">The sound instruction and the wholesome board ;</l>
     <l n="150">And first our School for Ladies ;— pity calls</l>
     <l n="151">For one soft sigh , when we behold these walls ,</l>
     <l n="152">Placed near the town , and where , from window high ,</l>
     <l n="153">The fair , confined , may our free crowds espy ,</l>
     <l n="154">With many a stranger gazing up and down ,</l>
     <l n="155">And all the envied tumult of the town ;</l>
     <l n="156">May , in the smiling summer-eve , when they</l>
     <l n="157">Are sent to sleep the pleasant hours away ,</l>
     <l n="158">Behold the poor ( whom they conceive the bless 'd )</l>
     <l n="159">Employ 'd for hours , and grieved they cannot rest .</l>
     <l n="160">Here the fond girl , whose days are sad and few</l>
     <l n="161">Since dear mamma pronounced the last adieu ,</l>
     <l n="162">Looks to the road , and fondly thinks she hears</l>
     <l n="163">The carriage-wheels , and struggles with her tears :</l>
     <l n="164">All yet is new , the misses great and small ,</l>
     <l n="165">Madam herself , and teachers , odious all ;</l>
     <l n="166">From laughter , pity , nay command , she turns ,</l>
     <l n="167">But melts in softness , or with anger burns ;</l>
     <l n="168">Nauseates her food , and wonders who can sleep</l>
     <l n="169">On such mean beds , where she can only weep :</l>
     <l n="170">She scorns condolence — but to all she hates</l>
     <l n="171">Slowly at length her mind accommodates ;</l>
     <l n="172">Then looks on bondage with the same concern</l>
     <l n="173">As others felt , and finds that she must learn</l>
     <l n="174">As others learn 'd — the common lot to share ,</l>
     <l n="175">To search for comfort and submit to care .</l>
     <l n="176">There are , ‘ tis said , who on these seats attend ,</l>
     <l n="177">And to these ductile minds destruction vend ;</l>
     <l n="178">Wretches — ( to virtue , peace , and nature , foes ) -</l>
     <l n="179">To these soft minds , their wicked trash expose ;</l>
     <l n="180">Seize on the soul , ere passions take the sway ,</l>
     <l n="181">And lead the heart , ere yet it feels , astray :</l>
     <l n="182">Smugglers obscene !— and can there be who take</l>
     <l n="183">Infernal pains the sleeping vice to wake ?</l>
     <l n="184">Can there be those by whom the thought defiled</l>
     <l n="185">Enters the spotless bosom of a child ?</l>
     <l n="186">By whom the ill is to the heart conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="187">Who lend the foe , not yet in arms , their aid ;</l>
     <l n="188">And sap the city-walls before the siege be laid ?</l>
     <l n="189">Oh ! rather skulking in the by-ways steal ,</l>
     <l n="190">And rob the poorest traveller of his meal ;</l>
     <l n="191">Burst through the humblest trader 's bolted door ;</l>
     <l n="192">Bear from the widow 's hut her winter-store ;</l>
     <l n="193">With stolen steed , on highways take your stand ,</l>
     <l n="194">Your lips with curses arm 'd , with death your hand ; -</l>
     <l n="195">Take all but life — the virtuous more would say ,</l>
     <l n="196">Take life itself , dear as it is , away ,</l>
     <l n="197">Rather than guilty thus the guileless soul betray .</l>
     <l n="198">Years pass away — let us suppose them past ,</l>
     <l n="199">Th ’ accomplish 'd nymph for freedom looks at last ;</l>
     <l n="200">All hardships over , which a school contains ,</l>
     <l n="201">The spirit 's bondage and the body 's pains ;</l>
     <l n="202">Where teachers make the heartless , trembling set</l>
     <l n="203">Of pupils suffer for their own regret ;</l>
     <l n="204">Where winter 's cold , attack 'd by one poor fire ,</l>
     <l n="205">Chills the fair child , commanded to retire ;</l>
     <l n="206">She felt it keenly in the morning-air ,</l>
     <l n="207">Keenly she felt it at the evening prayer .</l>
     <l n="208">More pleasant summer ; but then walks were made ,</l>
     <l n="209">Not a sweet ramble , but a slow parade ;</l>
     <l n="210">They moved by pairs beside the hawthorn-hedge ,</l>
     <l n="211">Only to set their feelings on an edge ;</l>
     <l n="212">And now at eve , when all their spirits rise ,</l>
     <l n="213">Are sent to rest , and all their pleasure dies ;</l>
     <l n="214">Where yet they all the town-alert can see ,</l>
     <l n="215">And distant plough-boys pacing o'er the lea .</l>
     <l n="216">These and the tasks successive masters brought -</l>
     <l n="217">The French they conn 'd , the curious works they wrought ;</l>
     <l n="218">The hours they made their taper fingers strike</l>
     <l n="219">Note after note , all dull to them alike ;</l>
     <l n="220">Their drawings , dancings on appointed days ,</l>
     <l n="221">Playing with globes , and getting parts of plays :</l>
     <l n="222">The tender friendships made ‘ twixt heart and heart ,</l>
     <l n="223">When the dear friends had nothing to impart : -</l>
     <l n="224">All ! all ! are over ;— now th ’ accomplish 'd maid</l>
     <l n="225">Longs for the world , of nothing there afraid :</l>
     <l n="226">Dreams of delight invade her gentle breast ,</l>
     <l n="227">And fancied lovers rob the heart of rest ;</l>
     <l n="228">At the paternal door a carriage stands ,</l>
     <l n="229">Love knits their hearts and Hymen joins their hands .</l>
     <l n="230">Ah ! world unknown ! how charming is thy view ,</l>
     <l n="231">Thy pleasures many , and each pleasure new :</l>
     <l n="232">Ah ! world experienced ! what of thee is told ?</l>
     <l n="233">How few thy pleasures , and those few how old !</l>
     <l n="234">Within a silent street , and far apart</l>
     <l n="235">From noise of business , from a quay or mart ,</l>
     <l n="236">Stands an old spacious building , and the din</l>
     <l n="237">You hear without , explains the work within ;</l>
     <l n="238">Unlike the whispering of the nymphs , this noise</l>
     <l n="239">Loudly proclaims a “ Boarding-School for Boys ; ”</l>
     <l n="240">The master heeds it not , for thirty years</l>
     <l n="241">Have render 'd all familiar to his ears ;</l>
     <l n="242">He sits in comfort , ‘ mid the various sound</l>
     <l n="243">Of mingled tones for ever flowing round :</l>
     <l n="244">Day after day he to his task attends , -</l>
     <l n="245">Unvaried toil , and care that never ends :</l>
     <l n="246">Boys in their works proceed ; while his employ</l>
     <l n="247">Admits no change , or changes but the boy ;</l>
     <l n="248">Yet time has made it easy ;— he beside</l>
     <l n="249">Has power supreme , and power is sweet to pride :</l>
     <l n="250">But grant him pleasure ; what can teachers feel ,</l>
     <l n="251">Dependent helpers always at the wheel ?</l>
     <l n="252">Their power despised , their compensation small ,</l>
     <l n="253">Their labour dull , their life laborious all ;</l>
     <l n="254">Set after set the lower lads to make</l>
     <l n="255">Fit for the class which their superiors take ;</l>
     <l n="256">The road of learning for a time to track</l>
     <l n="257">In roughest state , and then again go back :</l>
     <l n="258">Just the same way , on other troops to wait , -</l>
     <l n="259">Attendants fix 'd at learning 's lower gate .</l>
     <l n="260">The Day-tasks now are over — to their ground</l>
     <l n="261">Rush the gay crowd with joy-compelling sound ;</l>
     <l n="262">Glad to elude the burthens of the day ,</l>
     <l n="263">The eager parties hurry to their play :</l>
     <l n="264">Then in these hours of liberty we find</l>
     <l n="265">The native bias of the opening mind ;</l>
     <l n="266">They yet possess not skill the mask to place ,</l>
     <l n="267">And hide the passions glowing in the face ;</l>
     <l n="268">Yet some are found — the close , the sly , the mean ,</l>
     <l n="269">Who know already all must not be seen .</l>
     <l n="270">Lo ! one who walks apart , although so young ,</l>
     <l n="271">He lays restraint upon his eye and tongue ,</l>
     <l n="272">Nor will he into scrapes or dangers get ,</l>
     <l n="273">And half the school are in the stripling 's debt :</l>
     <l n="274">Suspicious , timid , he is much afraid</l>
     <l n="275">Of trick and plot : — he dreads to be betray 'd :</l>
     <l n="276">He shuns all friendship , for he finds they lend</l>
     <l n="277">When lads begin to call each other friend :</l>
     <l n="278">Yet self with self has war ; the tempting sight</l>
     <l n="279">Of fruit on sale provokes his appetite ; -</l>
     <l n="280">See ! how he walks the sweet seduction by ;</l>
     <l n="281">That he is tempted , costs him first a sigh , -</l>
     <l n="282">‘ Tis dangerous to indulge , ‘ tis grievous to deny !</l>
     <l n="283">This he will choose , and whispering asks the price ,</l>
     <l n="284">The purchase dreadful , but the portion nice :</l>
     <l n="285">Within the pocket he explores the pence ;</l>
     <l n="286">Without , temptation strikes on either sense ,</l>
     <l n="287">The sight , the smell ;— but then he thinks again</l>
     <l n="288">Of money gone ! while fruit nor taste remain .</l>
     <l n="289">Meantime there comes an eager thoughtless boy ,</l>
     <l n="290">Who gives the price and only feels the joy :</l>
     <l n="291">Example dire : the youthful miser stops</l>
     <l n="292">And slowly back the treasured coinage drops :</l>
     <l n="293">Heroic deed ! for should he now comply ,</l>
     <l n="294">Can he tomorrow 's appetite deny ?</l>
     <l n="295">Beside , these spendthrifts who so freely live ,</l>
     <l n="296">Cloy 'd with their purchase , will a portion give : -</l>
     <l n="297">Here ends debate , he buttons up his store ,</l>
     <l n="298">And feels the comfort that it burns no more .</l>
     <l n="299">Unlike to him the Tyrant-boy , whose sway</l>
     <l n="300">All hearts acknowledge ; him the crowds obey :</l>
     <l n="301">At his command they break through every rule ;</l>
     <l n="302">Whoever governs , he controls the school :</l>
     <l n="303">‘ Tis not the distant emperor moves their fear ,</l>
     <l n="304">But the proud viceroy who is ever near .</l>
     <l n="305">Verres could do that mischief in a day ,</l>
     <l n="306">For which not Rome , in all its power , could pay ;</l>
     <l n="307">And these boy-tyrants will their slaves distress ,</l>
     <l n="308">And do the wrongs no master can redress :</l>
     <l n="309">The mind they load with fear ; it feels disdain</l>
     <l n="310">For its own baseness ; yet it tries in vain</l>
     <l n="311">To shake th ’ admitted power : — the coward comes again :</l>
     <l n="312">‘ Tis more than present pain these tyrants give ,</l>
     <l n="313">Long as we 've life some strong impressions live ;</l>
     <l n="314">And these young ruffians in the soul will sow</l>
     <l n="315">Seeds of all vices that on weakness grow .</l>
     <l n="316">Hark ! at his word the trembling younglings flee ,</l>
     <l n="317">Where he is walking none must walk but he ;</l>
     <l n="318">See ! from the winter fire the weak retreat ,</l>
     <l n="319">His the warm corner , his the favourite seat ,</l>
     <l n="320">Save when he yields it to some slave to keep</l>
     <l n="321">Awhile , then back , at his return , to creep :</l>
     <l n="322">At his command his poor dependants fly ,</l>
     <l n="323">And humbly bribe him as a proud ally ;</l>
     <l n="324">Flatter 'd by all , the notice he bestows ,</l>
     <l n="325">Is gross abuse , and bantering and blows ;</l>
     <l n="326">Yet he 's a dunce , and , spite of all his fame</l>
     <l n="327">Without the desk , within he feels his shame :</l>
     <l n="328">For there the weaker boy , who felt his scorn ,</l>
     <l n="329">For him corrects the blunders of the morn ;</l>
     <l n="330">And he is taught , unpleasant truth ! to find</l>
     <l n="331">The trembling body has the prouder mind .</l>
     <l n="332">Hark ! to that shout , that burst of empty noise ,</l>
     <l n="333">From a rude set of bluff , obstreperous boys ;</l>
     <l n="334">They who , like colts let loose , with vigour bound ,</l>
     <l n="335">And thoughtless spirit , o'er the beaten ground ;</l>
     <l n="336">Fearless they leap , and every youngster feels</l>
     <l n="337">His Alma active in his hands and heels .</l>
     <l n="338">These are the sons of farmers , and they come</l>
     <l n="339">With partial fondness for the joys of home ;</l>
     <l n="340">Their minds are coursing in their fathers ’ fields ,</l>
     <l n="341">And e'en the dream a lively pleasure yields ;</l>
     <l n="342">They , much enduring , sit th ’ allotted hours ,</l>
     <l n="343">And o'er a grammar waste their sprightly powers ;</l>
     <l n="344">They dance ; but them can measured steps delight ,</l>
     <l n="345">Whom horse and hounds to daring deeds excite ?</l>
     <l n="346">Nor could they bear to wait from meal to meal ,</l>
     <l n="347">Did they not slily to the chamber steal ,</l>
     <l n="348">And there the produce of the basket seize ,</l>
     <l n="349">The mother 's gift ! still studious of their ease .</l>
     <l n="350">Poor Alma , thus oppress 'd forbears to rise ,</l>
     <l n="351">But rests or revels in the arms and thighs .</l>
     <l n="352">“ But is it sure that study will repay</l>
     <l n="353">The more attentive and forbearing ? ” — Nay !</l>
     <l n="354">The farm , the ship , the humble shop , have each</l>
     <l n="355">Gains which severest studies seldom reach .</l>
     <l n="356">At College place a youth , who means to raise</l>
     <l n="357">His state by merit and his name by praise ;</l>
     <l n="358">Still much he hazards ; there is serious strife</l>
     <l n="359">In the contentions of a scholar 's life :</l>
     <l n="360">Not all the mind 's attention , care , distress ,</l>
     <l n="361">Nor diligence itself , ensure success :</l>
     <l n="362">His jealous heart a rival 's powers may dread ,</l>
     <l n="363">Till its strong feelings have confused his head ,</l>
     <l n="364">And , after days and months , nay , years of pain ,</l>
     <l n="365">He finds just lost the object he would gain .</l>
     <l n="366">But grant him this and all such life can give ,</l>
     <l n="367">For other prospects he begins to live ;</l>
     <l n="368">Begins to feel that man was form 'd to look</l>
     <l n="369">And long for other objects than a book :</l>
     <l n="370">In his mind 's eye his house and glebe he sees ,</l>
     <l n="371">And farms and talks with farmers at his ease ;</l>
     <l n="372">And time is lost , till fortune sends him forth</l>
     <l n="373">To a rude world unconscious of his worth ;</l>
     <l n="374">There in some petty parish to reside ,</l>
     <l n="375">The college boast , then turn 'd the village guide :</l>
     <l n="376">And though awhile his flock and dairy please ,</l>
     <l n="377">He soon reverts to former joys and ease ,</l>
     <l n="378">Glad when a friend shall come to break his rest ,</l>
     <l n="379">And speak of all the pleasures they possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="380">Of masters , fellows , tutors , all with whom</l>
     <l n="381">They shared those pleasures , never more to come ;</l>
     <l n="382">Till both conceive the times by bliss endear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="383">Which once so dismal and so dull appear 'd .</l>
     <l n="384">But fix our Scholar , and suppose him crown 'd</l>
     <l n="385">With all the glory gain 'd on classic ground ;</l>
     <l n="386">Suppose the world without a sigh resign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="387">And to his college all his care confined ;</l>
     <l n="388">Give him all honours that such states allow ,</l>
     <l n="389">The freshman 's terror and the tradesman 's bow ;</l>
     <l n="390">Let his apartments with his taste agree ,</l>
     <l n="391">And all his views be those he loves to see ;</l>
     <l n="392">Let him each day behold the savoury treat ,</l>
     <l n="393">For which he pays not , but is paid to eat ;</l>
     <l n="394">These joys and glories soon delight no more ,</l>
     <l n="395">Although , withheld , the mind is vex 'd and sore ;</l>
     <l n="396">The honour too is to the place confined ,</l>
     <l n="397">Abroad they know not each superior mind :</l>
     <l n="398">Strangers no wranglers in these figures see ,</l>
     <l n="399">Nor give they worship to a high degree ;</l>
     <l n="400">Unlike the prophet 's is the scholar 's case ,</l>
     <l n="401">His honour all is in his dwelling-place :</l>
     <l n="402">And there such honours are familiar things ;</l>
     <l n="403">What is a monarch in a crowd of kings ?</l>
     <l n="404">Like other sovereigns he 's by forms address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="405">By statutes governed and with rules oppress 'd .</l>
     <l n="406">When all these forms and duties die away ,</l>
     <l n="407">And the day passes like the former day ,</l>
     <l n="408">Then of exterior things at once bereft ,</l>
     <l n="409">He 's to himself and one attendant left ;</l>
     <l n="410">Nay , John too goes ; nor aught of service more</l>
     <l n="411">Remains for him ; he gladly quits the door ,</l>
     <l n="412">And , as he whistles to the college-gate ,</l>
     <l n="413">He kindly pities his poor master 's fate .</l>
     <l n="414">Books cannot always please , however good ;</l>
     <l n="415">Minds are not ever craving for their food ;</l>
     <l n="416">But sleep will soon the weary soul prepare</l>
     <l n="417">For cares to-morrow that were this day 's care :</l>
     <l n="418">For forms , for feasts , that sundry times have past ,</l>
     <l n="419">And formal feasts that will for ever last .</l>
     <l n="420">“ But then from Study will no comforts rise ? ” -</l>
     <l n="421">Yes ! such as studious minds alone can prize ;</l>
     <l n="422">Comforts , yea !— joys ineffable they find ,</l>
     <l n="423">Who seek the prouder pleasures of the mind :</l>
     <l n="424">The soul , collected in those happy hours ,</l>
     <l n="425">Then makes her efforts , then enjoys her powers ;</l>
     <l n="426">And in those seasons feels herself repaid ,</l>
     <l n="427">For labours past and honours long delay 'd .</l>
     <l n="428">No ! ‘ tis not worldly gain , although by chance</l>
     <l n="429">The sons of learning may to wealth advance ;</l>
     <l n="430">Nor station high , though in some favouring hour</l>
     <l n="431">The sons of learning may arrive at power ;</l>
     <l n="432">Nor is it glory , though the public voice</l>
     <l n="433">Of honest praise will make the heart rejoice :</l>
     <l n="434">But ‘ tis the mind 's own feelings give tho joy ,</l>
     <l n="435">Pleasures she gathers in her own employ -</l>
     <l n="436">Pleasures that gain or praise cannot bestow ,</l>
     <l n="437">Yet can dilate and raise them when they flow .</l>

   <p>{ 2 } The wants and mortifications of a poor clergyman are the subjects of one portion of this Letter ; and he being represented as a stranger in the Borough , it may be necessary to make some apology for his appearance in the Poem . Previous to a late meeting of a literary society , whose benevolent purpose is well known to the public , I was induced by a friend to compose a few verses , in which , with the general commendation of the design , should be introduced a hint that the bounty might be farther extended ; these verses , a gentleman did me the honour to recite at the meeting , and they were printed as an extract from the Poem , to which , in fact , they may be called an appendage .</p>

     <l n="1">{ 3 } The account of Coddrington occurs in “ The Mirrour for</l>
     <l n="2">Magistrates . ” He suffered in the reign of Richard III .</l>

   <p>{ 4 } If I have in this letter praised the good-humour of a man confessedly too inattentive to business , and if , in another ( AMUSEMENTS ) , I have written somewhat sarcastically of “ the brick - floored parlour which the butcher lets , ” be credit given to me , that , in the one case , I had no intention to apologise for idleness , nor any design in the other to treat with contempt the resources of the poor . The good-humour is considered as the consolation of disappointment ; and the room is so mentioned because the lodger is vain . Most of my readers will perceive this : but I shall be sorry if by any I am supposed to make pleas for the vices of men , or treat their wants or infirmities with derision or with disdain .</p>
   <p>{ 5 } The Letter on Itinerant Players will to some appear too harshly written , their profligacy exaggerated , and their distresses magnified ; but though the respectability of a part of these people may give us a more favourable view of the whole body ; though some actors be sober , and some managers prudent ; still there is vice and misery left more than sufficient to justify my description . But , if I could find only one woman who ( passing forty years on many stages and sustaining many principal characters ) laments in her unrespected old age , that there was no workhouse to which she could legally sue for admission ; if I could produce only one female , seduced upon the boards , and starved in her lodging , compelled by her poverty to sing , and by her sufferings to weep , without any prospect but misery , or any consolation but death ; if I could exhibit only one youth who sought refuge from parental authority in the licentious freedom of a wandering company ; yet , with three such examples , I should feel myself justified in the account I have given : — but such characters and sufferings are common , and there are few of these societies which could not show members of this description . To some , indeed , the life has its satisfactions : they never expected to be free from labour , and their present kind they think is light : they have no delicate ideas of shame , and therefore duns and hisses give them no other pain than what arises from the fear of not being trusted , joined with the apprehension that they may have nothing to subsist upon except their credit .</p>
   <p>{ 6 } For the Alms-house itself , its Governors , and Inhabitants , I have not much to offer in favour of the subject or of the character . One of these , Sir Denys Brand , may be considered as too highly placed for an author , who seldom ventures above middle life , to delineate ; and , indeed , I had some idea of reserving him for another occasion , where he might have appeared with those in his own rank : but then it is most uncertain whether he would ever appear , and he has been so many years prepared for the public , whenever opportunity might offer that I have at length given him place , and though with his inferiors , yet as a ruler over them .</p>
   <p>{ 7 } Benbow may be thought too low and despicable to be admitted here ; but he is a borough-character , and however disgusting in some respects a picture may be , it will please some , and be tolerated by many , if it can boast that one merit of being a faithful likeness .</p>
   <p>{ 8 } The characters of the Hospital Directors were written many years since and , so far as I was capable of judging , are drawn with fidelity . I mention this circumstance that , if any reader should find a difference in the versification or expression , he will be thus enabled to account for it .</p>
   <p>{ 9 } The Poor are here almost of necessity introduced , for they must be considered , in every place , as a large and interesting portion of its inhabitants . I am aware of the great difficulty of acquiring just notions on the maintenance and management of this class of our fellow subjects , and I forbear to express any opinion of the various modes which have been discussed or adopted : of one method only I venture to give my sentiments ,— that of collecting the poor of a hundred into one building . This admission of a vast number of persons , of all ages and both sexes , of very different inclinations , habits , and capacities , into a society , must , at a first view I conceive , be looked upon as a cause of both vice and misery ; nor does anything which I have heard or read invalidate the opinion : happily , the method is not a prevailing one , as these houses are , I believe , still confined to that part of the kingdom where they originated .</p>
   <p>{ 10 } John Bunyan , in one of the many productions of his zeal , has ventured to make public this extraordinary sentiment , which the frigid piety of our Clerk so readily adopted .</p>
   <p>{ 11 } The Life of Ellen Orford , though sufficiently burdened with error and misfortune , has in it little besides which resembles those of the unhappy men in the preceding Letters , and is still more unlike that of Grimes , in a subsequent one . There is in this character cheerfulness and resignation , a more uniform piety , and an immovable trust in the aid of religion . This , with the light texture of the introductory part , will , I hope , take off from that idea of sameness which the repetition of crimes and distresses is likely to create .</p>
   <p>{ 12 } It has been a subject of greater vexation to me than such trifle ought to be , that I could not , without destroying all appearance of arrangement , separate these melancholy narratives , and place the fallen Clerk in Office at a greater distance from the Clerk of the Parish , especially as they resembled each other in several particulars ; both being tempted , seduced , and wretched . Yet there are , I conceive , considerable marks of distinction : their guilt is of different kind ; nor would either have committed the offence of the other . The Clerk of the Parish could break the commandment , but he could not have been induced to have disowned an article of that creed for which he had so bravely contended , and on which he fully relied ; and the upright mind of the Clerk in Office would have secured him from being guilty of wrong and robbery , though his weak and vacillating intellect could not preserve him from infidelity and profaneness . Their melancholy is nearly alike , but not its consequences . Jachin retained hia belief , and though he hated life , he could never be induced to quit it voluntarily ; but Abel was driven to terminate his misery in a way which the unfixedness of his religious opinions rather accelerated than retarded . I am , therefore , not without hope , that the more observant of my readers will perceive many marks of discrimination in these characters .</p>
   <p>{ 13 } The character of Grimes , his obduracy and apparent want of feeling , his gloomy kind of misanthropy , the progress of his madness , and the horrors of his imagination , I must leave to the judgment and observation of my readers . The mind here exhibited is one untouched by pity , unstung by remorse , and uncorrected by shame ; yet is this hardihood of temper and spirit broken by want , disease , solitude , and disappointment : and he becomes the victim of a distempered and horror-stricken fancy . It is evident , therefore , that no feeble vision , no half-visible ghost , not the momentary glance of an unbodied being , nor the half-audible voice of an invisible one , would be created by the continual workings of distress on a mind so depraved and flinty . The ruffian of Mr Scott ( Marmion ) has a mind of this nature ; he has no shame or remorse , but the corrosion of hopeless want , the wasting of unabating disease , and the gloom of unvaried solitude , will have their effect on every nature and the harder that nature is , and the longer time required to work upon it , so much the more strong and indelible is the impression . This is all the reason I am able to give , why a man of feeling so dull should yet become insane , and why the visions of his distempered brain should be of so horrible a nature .</p>
   <p>{ 14 } That a Letter on Prisons should follow the narratives of such characters as Keene and Grimes is unfortunate , but not to be easily avoided . I confess it is not pleasant to be detained so long by subiects so repulsive to the feelings of many as the sufferings of mankind ; but , though I assuredly would have altered this arrangement , had I been able to have done it by substituting a better , yet am I not of opinion that my verses , or , indeed , the verses of any other person , can so represent the evils and distresses of life as to make any material impression on the mind , and much less any of injurious nature . Alas ! sufferings real , evident , continually before us , have not effects very serious or lasting , even in the minds of the more reflecting and compassionate ; nor , indeed , does it seem right that the pain caused by sympathy should serve for more than a stimulus to benevolence . If then the strength and solidity of truth placed before our eyes have effect so feeble and transitory , I need not be very apprehensive that my representations of Poor-houses and Prisons , of wants and sufferings , however faithfully taken , will excite any feelings which can be seriously lamented . It has always been held as a salutary exercise of the mind to contemplate the evils and miseries of our nature : I am not therefore without hope that even this gloomy subject of Imprisonment , and more especially the Dream of the Condemned Highwayman , will excite in some minds that mingled pity and abhorrence which , while it is not unpleasant to the feelings , is useful in its operation . It ties and binds us to all mankind by sensations common to us all , and in some degree connects us , without degradation , even to the most miserable and guilty of our fellow-men .</p>
   <p>{ 15 } Our concluding subject is Education ; and some attempt is made to describe its various seminaries , from that of the poor widow who pronounces the alphabet for infants , to seats whence the light of learning is shed abroad on the world . If , in this Letter , I describe the lives of literary men as embittered by much evil ; if they be often disappointed , and sometimes unfitted for the world they improve ; let it be considered that they are described as men who possess that great pleasure , the exercise of their own talents , and the delight which flows from their own exertions : they have joy in their pursuits , and glory in their acquirements of knowledge . Their victory over difficulties affords the most rational cause of triumph , and the attainment of new ideas leads to incalculable riches , such as gratify the glorious avarice of aspiring and comprehensive minds . Here , then , I place the reward of Learning . Our Universities produce men of the first scholastic attainments , who are heirs to large possessions , or descendants from noble families . Now , to those so favoured , talents and acquirements are unquestionably means of arriving at the most elevated and important situations ; but these must be the lot of a few : in general , the diligence , acuteness , and perseverance of a youth at the University , have no other reward than some college honours and emoluments , which they desire to exchange , many of them , for very moderate incomes in the obscurity of some distant village ; so that , in stating the reward of an ardent and powerful mind to consist principally ( I might have said entirely ) in its own views , efforts , and excursions , I place it upon a sure foundation , though not one so elevated as the more ambitious aspire to . It is surely some encouragement to a studious man to reflect that , if he be disappointed , he cannot be without gratification ; and that , if he gets but a very humble portion of what the world can give , he has a continual fruition of unwearying enjoyment , of which it has not power to deprive him .</p>
