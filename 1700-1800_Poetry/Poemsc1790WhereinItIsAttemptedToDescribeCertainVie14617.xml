    <head>A WINTER DAY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The cock , warm roosting ‘ midst his feather 'd dames ,</l>
     <l n="2">Now lifts his beak and snuffs the morning air ,</l>
     <l n="3">Stretches his neck and claps his heavy wings ,</l>
     <l n="4">Gives three hoarse crows , and glad his talk is done ;</l>
     <l n="5">Low , chuckling , turns himself upon the roost ,</l>
     <l n="6">Then nestles down again amongst his mates .</l>
     <l n="7">The lab'ring hind , who on his bed of straw ,</l>
     <l n="8">Beneath his home-made coverings , coarse , but warm ,</l>
     <l n="9">Lock 'd in the kindly arms of her who spun them ,</l>
     <l n="10">Dreams of the gain that next year 's crop should bring ;</l>
     <l n="11">Or at some fair disposing of his wool ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or by some lucky and unlook'dhYpppHeNfor bargain .</l>
     <l n="13">Fills his skin purse with heaps of tempting gold ,</l>
     <l n="14">Now wakes from sleep at the unwelcome call ,</l>
     <l n="15">And finds himself but just the same poor man</l>
     <l n="16">As when he went to rest .—</l>
     <l n="17">He hears the blast against his window beat ,</l>
     <l n="18">And wishes to himself he were a lord ,</l>
     <l n="19">That he might lie a-bed .—</l>
     <l n="20">He rubs his eyes , and stretches out his arms ;</l>
     <l n="21">Heigh ho ! heigh ho ! he drawls with gaping mouth ,</l>
     <l n="22">Then most unwillingly creeps out of bed ,</l>
     <l n="23">And without looking-glass puts on his clothes .</l>
     <l n="24">With rueful face he blows the smother 'd fire ,</l>
     <l n="25">And lights his candle at the red'ning coal ;</l>
     <l n="26">First sees that all be right amongst his cattle ,</l>
     <l n="27">Then hies him to the barn with heavy tread ,</l>
     <l n="28">Printing his footsteps on the new fall'n snow .</l>
     <l n="29">From out the heap of corn he pulls his sheaves ,</l>
     <l n="30">Dislodging the poor red-breast from his shelter ,</l>
     <l n="31">Where all the live-long night he slept secure ;</l>
     <l n="32">But now afrighted , with uncertain flight</l>
     <l n="33">He flutters round the walls , to seek some hole ,</l>
     <l n="34">At which he may escape out to the frost .</l>
     <l n="35">And now the flail , high whirling o'er his head ,</l>
     <l n="36">Descends with force upon the jumping sheave ,</l>
     <l n="37">Whilst every rugged wall , and neighboring cot</l>
     <l n="38">Re-echoes back the noise of his strokes .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="39">The fam'ly cares call next upon the wife</l>
     <l n="40">To quit her mean but comfortable bed .</l>
     <l n="41">And first she stirs the fire , and blows the flame ,</l>
     <l n="42">Then from her heap of sticks , for winter stor 'd ,</l>
     <l n="43">An armful brings ; loud crackling as they burn ,</l>
     <l n="44">Thick fly the red sparks upward to the roof ,</l>
     <l n="45">While slowly mounts the smoke in wreathy clouds .</l>
     <l n="46">On goes the seething pot with morning cheer ,</l>
     <l n="47">For which some little wishful hearts await ,</l>
     <l n="48">Who , peeping from the bed-clothes , spy , well pleas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="49">The cheery light that blazes on the wall ,</l>
     <l n="50">And bawl for leave to rise .——</l>
     <l n="51">Their busy mother knows not where to turn ,</l>
     <l n="52">Her morning work comes now so thick upon her .</l>
     <l n="53">One she must help to tye his little coat ,</l>
     <l n="54">Unpin his cap , and seck another 's shoe .</l>
     <l n="55">When all is o'er , out to the door they run ,</l>
     <l n="56">With new comb 'd sleeky hair , and glist'ning cheeks ,</l>
     <l n="57">Each with some little project in his head .</l>
     <l n="58">One on the ice must try his new sol 'd shoes :</l>
     <l n="59">To view his well-set trap another hies ,</l>
     <l n="60">In hopes to find some poor unwary bird</l>
     <l n="61">( No worthless prize ) entangled in his snare ;</l>
     <l n="62">Whilst one , less active , with round rosy face ,</l>
     <l n="63">Spreads out his purple fingers to the fire ,</l>
     <l n="64">And peeps , most wishfully , into the pot .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="65">But let us leave the warm and cheerful house ,</l>
     <l n="66">To view the bleak and dreary scene without ,</l>
     <l n="67">And mark the dawning of a winter day .</l>
     <l n="68">For now the morning vapour , red and grumly ,</l>
     <l n="69">Rests heavy on the hills ; and o'er the heav'ns</l>
     <l n="70">Wide spreading forth in lighter gradual fliades ,</l>
     <l n="71">Just faintly colours the pale muddy sky .</l>
     <l n="72">Then slowly from behind the southern hills ,</l>
     <l n="73">Inlarg 'd and ruddy looks the rising sun ,</l>
     <l n="74">Shooting his beams askance the hoary waste ,</l>
     <l n="75">Which gild the brow of ev'ry swelling height ,</l>
     <l n="76">And deepen every valley with a shade .</l>
     <l n="77">The crusted window of each scatter 'd cot ,</l>
     <l n="78">The icicles that fringe the thatched roof ,</l>
     <l n="79">The new swept slide upon the frozen pool ,</l>
     <l n="80">All lightly glance , new kindled with his rays ;</l>
     <l n="81">And e'en the rugged face of scowling Winter</l>
     <l n="82">Looks somewhat gay . But for a little while</l>
     <l n="83">He lifts his glory o'er the bright'ning earth ,</l>
     <l n="84">Then hides his head behind a misty cloud ,</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="85">The birds now quit their holes and lurking sheds ,</l>
     <l n="86">Most mute and melancholy , where thro ’ night</l>
     <l n="87">All nestling close to keep each other warm ,</l>
     <l n="88">In downy sleep they had forgot their hardships ;</l>
     <l n="89">But not to chant and carol in the air ,</l>
     <l n="90">Or lightly swing upon some waving bough ,</l>
     <l n="91">And merrily return each other 's notes ;</l>
     <l n="92">No ; silently they hop from bush to bush ,</l>
     <l n="93">Yet find no seeds to stop their craving want ,</l>
     <l n="94">Then bend their flight to the low smoking cot ,</l>
     <l n="95">Chirp on the roof , or at the window peck ,</l>
     <l n="96">To tell their wants to those who lodge within .</l>
     <l n="97">The poor lank hare flies homeward to his den ,</l>
     <l n="98">But little burthen 'd with his nightly meal</l>
     <l n="99">Of wither 'd greens grubb 'd from the farmer 's garden ;</l>
     <l n="100">A poor and scanty portion snatch 'd in fear ;</l>
     <l n="101">And fearful creatures , forc 'd abroad by want ,</l>
     <l n="102">Are now to ev'ry enemy a prey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="103">The husbandman lays bye his heavy flail ,</l>
     <l n="104">And to the house returns , where on him wait</l>
     <l n="105">His smoking breakfast and impatient children ;</l>
     <l n="106">Who , spoon in hand , and longing to begin ,</l>
     <l n="107">Towards the door cast many a weary look</l>
     <l n="108">To see their dad come in .——</l>
     <l n="109">Then round they sit , a chearful company ,</l>
     <l n="110">All eagerly begin , and with heap 'd spoons</l>
     <l n="111">Besmear from ear to ear their rosy cheeks .</l>
     <l n="112">The faithful dog stands by his matter 's side</l>
     <l n="113">Wagging his tail , and looking in his face ;</l>
     <l n="114">While humble puss pays court to all around ,</l>
     <l n="115">And purs and rubs them with her furry sides ;</l>
     <l n="116">Nor goes this little flattery unrewarded .</l>
     <l n="117">But the laborious sit not long at table ;</l>
     <l n="118">The grateful father lifts his eyes to heav'n</l>
     <l n="119">To bless his God , whose ever bounteous hand</l>
     <l n="120">Him and his little ones doth daily feed ;</l>
     <l n="121">Then rises satisfied to work again .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="122">The chearful rousing noise of industry</l>
     <l n="123">Is heard , with varied sounds , thro ’ all the village .</l>
     <l n="124">The humming wheel , the thrifty housewife 's tongue ,</l>
     <l n="125">Who scolds to keep her maidens at their work ,</l>
     <l n="126">Rough grating cards , and voice of squaling children</l>
     <l n="127">Issue from every house .——</l>
     <l n="128">But , hark !— the sportsman from the neighb'ring hedge</l>
     <l n="129">His thunder sends !— loud bark each village cur ;</l>
     <l n="130">Up from her wheel each curious maiden starts ,</l>
     <l n="131">And hastens to the door , whilst matrons chide ,</l>
     <l n="132">Yet run to look themselves , in spite of thrift ,</l>
     <l n="133">And all the little town is in a stir .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="134">Strutting before , the cock leads forth his train ,</l>
     <l n="135">And , chuckling near the barn among the straw ,</l>
     <l n="136">Reminds the farmer of his morning 's service ;</l>
     <l n="137">His grateful master throws a lib'ral handful ;</l>
     <l n="138">They flock about it , whilst the hungry sparrows</l>
     <l n="139">Perch 'd on the roof , look down with envious eye ,</l>
     <l n="140">Then , aiming well , amidst the feeders light ,</l>
     <l n="141">And seize upon the feast with greedy bill ,</l>
     <l n="142">Till angry partlets peck them off the field .</l>
     <l n="143">But at a distance , on the leafless tree ,</l>
     <l n="144">All woe be gone , the lonely blackbird sits ;</l>
     <l n="145">The cold north wind ruffles his glossy feathers ;</l>
     <l n="146">Full oft ’ he looks , but dare not make approach ;</l>
     <l n="147">Then turns his yellow bill to peck his side ,</l>
     <l n="148">And claps his wings close to his sharpen 'd breast .</l>
     <l n="149">The wand'ring fowler , from behind the hedge ,</l>
     <l n="150">Fastens his eye upon him , points his gun ,</l>
     <l n="151">And firing wantonly as at a mark ,</l>
     <l n="152">E'en lays him low in that same cheerful spot</l>
     <l n="153">Which oft ’ hath ccho 'd with his ev'ning ' s song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="154">The day now at its height , the pent-up kine</l>
     <l n="155">Are driven from their flails to take the air .</l>
     <l n="156">How stupidly they stare ! and feel how strange !</l>
     <l n="157">They open wide their smoking mouths to low ,</l>
     <l n="158">But scarcely can their feeble sound be heard ;</l>
     <l n="159">Then turn and lick themselves , and step by step</l>
     <l n="160">Move dull and heavy to their flails again .</l>
     <l n="161">In scatter 'd groups the little idle boys</l>
     <l n="162">With purple fingers , moulding in the snow</l>
     <l n="163">Their icy ammunition , pant for war ;</l>
     <l n="164">And , drawing up in opposite array ,</l>
     <l n="165">Send forth a mighty fliower of well aim 'd balls ,</l>
     <l n="166">Whilst little hero 's try their growing flrength ,</l>
     <l n="167">And burn to beat the en'my off the field .</l>
     <l n="168">Or on the well worn ice in eager throngs ,</l>
     <l n="169">Aiming their race , shoot rapidly along ,</l>
     <l n="170">Trip up each other 's heels , and on the surface</l>
     <l n="171">With knotted shoes , draw many a chalky line .</l>
     <l n="172">Untir 'd of play , they never cease their sport</l>
     <l n="173">Till the faint sun has almost run his course ,</l>
     <l n="174">And threat'ning clouds , slow rising from the north ,</l>
     <l n="175">Spread grumly darkness o'er the face of heav'n ;</l>
     <l n="176">Then , by degrees , they scatter to their homes ,</l>
     <l n="177">With many a broken head and bloody nose ,</l>
     <l n="178">To claim their mothers ’ pity , who , most skilful ,</l>
     <l n="179">Cures all their troubles with a bit of bread .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="180">The night comes on a pace ——</l>
     <l n="181">Chill blows the blast , and drives the snow in wreaths .</l>
     <l n="182">Now ev'ry creature looks around for shelter ,</l>
     <l n="183">And , whether man or beast , all move alike</l>
     <l n="184">Towards their several homes ; and happy they</l>
     <l n="185">Who have a house to screen them from the cold !</l>
     <l n="186">Lo , o'er the frost a rev'rend form advances !</l>
     <l n="187">His hair white as the snow on which he treads ,</l>
     <l n="188">His forehead mark 'd with many a care-worn furrow ,</l>
     <l n="189">Whose feeble body , bending o'er a staff ,</l>
     <l n="190">Still shew that once it was the seat of strength ,</l>
     <l n="191">Tho ’ now it shakes like some old ruin 'd tow'r ,</l>
     <l n="192">Cloth 'd indeed , but not disgrac 'd with rags ,</l>
     <l n="193">He still maintains that decent dignity</l>
     <l n="194">Which well becomes those who have serv 'd their country .</l>
     <l n="195">With tott'ring steps he to the cottage moves :</l>
     <l n="196">The wife within , who hears his hollow cough ,</l>
     <l n="197">And patt'ring of iris stick upon the threshold ,</l>
     <l n="198">Sends out her little boy to see who 's there .</l>
     <l n="199">The child looks up to view the stranger 's face ,</l>
     <l n="200">And seeing it enlighten 'd with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="201">Holds out his little hand to lead him in .</l>
     <l n="202">Rous 'd from her work , the mother turns her head ,</l>
     <l n="203">And sees them , not ill-pleas 'd .——</l>
     <l n="204">The stranger whines not with a piteous tale ,</l>
     <l n="205">But only asks a little , to relieve</l>
     <l n="206">A poor old soldier 's wants .——</l>
     <l n="207">The gentle matron brings the ready chair ,</l>
     <l n="208">And bids him sit , to rest his wearied limbs ,</l>
     <l n="209">And warm himself before her blazing fire .</l>
     <l n="210">The children , full of curiosity ,</l>
     <l n="211">Flock round , and with their fingers in their mouths ,</l>
     <l n="212">Stand staring at him ; whilst the stranger , pleas 'd ,</l>
     <l n="213">Takes up the youngest boy upon his knee .</l>
     <l n="214">Proud of its seat , it wags its little feet ,</l>
     <l n="215">And prates , and laughs , and plays with his white locks .</l>
     <l n="216">But soon the soldier 's face lays off its smiles ;</l>
     <l n="217">His thoughtful mind is turn 'd on other days ,</l>
     <l n="218">When his own boys were wont to play around him ,</l>
     <l n="219">Who now lie distant from their native land</l>
     <l n="220">In honourable , but untimely graves .</l>
     <l n="221">He feels how helpless and forlorn he is ,</l>
     <l n="222">And bitter tears gush from his dim-worn eyes .</l>
     <l n="223">His toilsome daily labour at an end ,</l>
     <l n="224">In comes the wearied master of the house ,</l>
     <l n="225">And marks with satisfaction his old guest ,</l>
     <l n="226">With all his children round .—</l>
     <l n="227">His honest heart is fill 'd with manly kindness ;</l>
     <l n="228">He bids him stay , and share their homely meal ,</l>
     <l n="229">And take with them his quarters for the night .</l>
     <l n="230">The weary wanderer thankfully accepts ,</l>
     <l n="231">And , seated with the cheerful family ,</l>
     <l n="232">Around the plain but hospitable board ,</l>
     <l n="233">Forgets the many hardships he has pass 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="234">When all are satisfied , about the fire</l>
     <l n="235">They draw their seats , and form a cheerful ring .</l>
     <l n="236">The thrifty housewife turns her spinning wheel ;</l>
     <l n="237">The husband , useful even in his rest ,</l>
     <l n="238">A little basket weaves of willow twigs ,</l>
     <l n="239">To bear her eggs to town on market days ;</l>
     <l n="240">And work but serves t'enliven conversation .</l>
     <l n="241">Some idle neighbours now come straggling in ,</l>
     <l n="242">Draw round their chairs , and widen out the circle .</l>
     <l n="243">Without a glass the tale and jest go round ;</l>
     <l n="244">And every one , in his own native way ,</l>
     <l n="245">Does what he can to cheer the merry group .</l>
     <l n="246">Each tells some little story of himself ,</l>
     <l n="247">That constant subject upon which mankind ,</l>
     <l n="248">Whether in court or country , love to dwell .</l>
     <l n="249">How at a fair he sav 'd a simple clown</l>
     <l n="250">From being tricked in buying of a cow ;</l>
     <l n="251">Or laid a bet upon his horse 's head</l>
     <l n="252">Against his neighbour 's , bought for twice his price ,</l>
     <l n="253">Which fail 'd not to repay his better skill :</l>
     <l n="254">Or on a harvest day , bound in an hour</l>
     <l n="255">More sheaves of corn than any of his fellows ,</l>
     <l n="256">Tho ’ ne'er so keen , could do in twice the time .</l>
     <l n="257">But chief the landlord , at his own fire-side ,</l>
     <l n="258">Doth claim the right of being listen 'd to ;</l>
     <l n="259">Nor dares a little bawling tongue be heard ,</l>
     <l n="260">Tho ’ but in play , to break upon his story .</l>
     <l n="261">The children sit and listen with the rest ;</l>
     <l n="262">And should the youngest raise its little voice ,</l>
     <l n="263">The careful mother , ever on the watch ,</l>
     <l n="264">And always pleas 'd with what her husband says ,</l>
     <l n="265">Gives it a gentle tap upon the fingers ,</l>
     <l n="266">Or stops its ill tim 'd prattle with a kiss .</l>
     <l n="267">The soldier next , but not unask 'd , begins ,</l>
     <l n="268">And tells in better speech what he has seen ;</l>
     <l n="269">Making his simple audience to shrink</l>
     <l n="270">With tales of war and blood . They gaze upon him ,</l>
     <l n="271">And almost weep to see the man so poor ,</l>
     <l n="272">So bent and feeble , helpless and forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="273">That oft ’ has stood undaunted in the battle</l>
     <l n="274">Whilst thund'ring cannons shook the quaking earth ,</l>
     <l n="275">And showering bullets hiss 'd around his head .</l>
     <l n="276">With little care they pass away the night ,</l>
     <l n="277">Till time draws on when they should go to bed ;</l>
     <l n="278">Then all break up , and each retires to rest</l>
     <l n="279">With peaceful mind , nor torn with vexing cares ,</l>
     <l n="280">Nor dancing with the unequal beat of pleasure .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="281">But long accustom 'd to observe the weather ,</l>
     <l n="282">The labourer cannot lay him down in peace</l>
     <l n="283">Till he has look 'd to mark what bodes the night ,</l>
     <l n="284">He turns the heavy door , thrusts out his head ,</l>
     <l n="285">Sees wreathes of snow heap 'd up on ev'ry side ,</l>
     <l n="286">And black and grimily all above his head ,</l>
     <l n="287">Save when a red gleam shoots along the waste</l>
     <l n="288">To make the gloomy night more terrible</l>
     <l n="289">Loud blows the northern blast ——</l>
     <l n="290">He hears it hollow grumbling from afar ,</l>
     <l n="291">Then , gath'ring strength , roll on with doubl 'd might ,</l>
     <l n="292">And break in dreadful bellowings o'er his head ;</l>
     <l n="293">Like pithless saplings bend the vexed trees ,</l>
     <l n="294">And their wide branches crack . He shuts the door ,</l>
     <l n="295">And , thankful for the roof that covers him ,</l>
     <l n="296">Hies him to bed .</l>

    <head>A SUMMER DAY .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The dark-blue clouds of night in dusky lines ,</l>
     <l n="2">Drawn wide and streaky o'er the purer sky ,</l>
     <l n="3">Wear faint the morning purple on their skirts .</l>
     <l n="4">The stars that full and bright shone in the west ,</l>
     <l n="5">But dimly twinkle to the stedfast eye ;</l>
     <l n="6">And seen , and vanishing , and seen again ,</l>
     <l n="7">Like dying tapers smoth'ring in their sockets ,</l>
     <l n="8">Appear at last shut from the face of heav'n ;</l>
     <l n="9">Whilst every lesser flame which shone by night ,</l>
     <l n="10">The flashy meteor from the op'ning cloud ,</l>
     <l n="11">That shoots full oft ’ across the dusky sky ;</l>
     <l n="12">Or wand'ring fire which looks across the marsh ,</l>
     <l n="13">Beaming like candle in a lonely cot ,</l>
     <l n="14">To cheer the hopes of the benighted trav'ller ,</l>
     <l n="15">Till swifter than the very change of thought ,</l>
     <l n="16">It shifts from place to place , escapes his glance ,</l>
     <l n="17">And makes him wond'ring rub his doubtful eyes ;</l>
     <l n="18">Or humble glow-worm , or the silver moth ,</l>
     <l n="19">Which cast a feeble glimm'ring o'er the green ,</l>
     <l n="20">All die away .——</l>
     <l n="21">For now the sun , slow moving in his grandeur ,</l>
     <l n="22">Above the eastern mountains lifts his head .</l>
     <l n="23">The webs of dew spread o'er the hoary lawn ,</l>
     <l n="24">The smooth clear bosom of the settled pool ,</l>
     <l n="25">The polish 'd ploughshare on the distant field ,</l>
     <l n="26">Catch fire from him , and dart their new got beams</l>
     <l n="27">Upon die dazzled eye .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="28">The new-wak 'd birds upon the branches hop ,</l>
     <l n="29">Peck their loft down , and bristle out their feathers ;</l>
     <l n="30">Then stretch their throats and tune their morning song ;</l>
     <l n="31">Whilst stately crows , high swinging o'er their heads .</l>
     <l n="32">Upon the topmost boughs , in lordly pride ,</l>
     <l n="33">Mix their hoarse croaking with the linnet 's note ;</l>
     <l n="34">Till gather 'd closer in a sable band ,</l>
     <l n="35">They take their flight to leek their daily food .</l>
     <l n="36">The village labourer , with careful mind ,</l>
     <l n="37">As soon as doth the morning light appear ,</l>
     <l n="38">Opens his eyes with the first darting ray</l>
     <l n="39">That pierces thro ’ the window of his cot ,</l>
     <l n="40">And quits his easy bed ; then o'er the field ,</l>
     <l n="41">With lengthen 'd swinging strides , betakes his way ,</l>
     <l n="42">Bearing his spade and hoe across his moulder ,</l>
     <l n="43">Seen from afar clear glancing in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="44">And with good will begins his daily work .</l>
     <l n="45">The sturdy sun-burnt boy drives forth the cattle ,</l>
     <l n="46">And vain of power , bawls to the lagging kine ,</l>
     <l n="47">Who fain would stay to crop the tender shoots</l>
     <l n="48">Of the green tempting hedges as they pass ;</l>
     <l n="49">Or beats the glist'ning bushes with his club ,</l>
     <l n="50">To please his fancy with a shower of dew ,</l>
     <l n="51">And frighten the poor birds who lurk within .</l>
     <l n="52">At ev'ry open door , thro ’ all the village ,</l>
     <l n="53">Half naked children , half awake , are seen</l>
     <l n="54">Scratching their heads , and blinking to the light ;</l>
     <l n="55">Till roused by degrees , they run about ,</l>
     <l n="56">Or rolling in the sun , amongst the sand</l>
     <l n="57">Build many a little house , with heedful art .</l>
     <l n="58">The housewife tends within , her morning care ;</l>
     <l n="59">And stooping ‘ midst her tubs of curdled milk ,</l>
     <l n="60">With busy patience , draws the clear green whey</l>
     <l n="61">From the press 'd sides of the pure snowy curd ;</l>
     <l n="62">Whilst her brown dimpled maid , with tuck'dhYpppHeNup sleeve ,</l>
     <l n="63">And swelling arm , assists her in her toil .</l>
     <l n="64">Pots smoke , pails rattle , and the warm confusion</l>
     <l n="65">Still thickens on them , till within its mould ,</l>
     <l n="66">With careful hands , they press the well-wrought curd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="67">So goes the morning , till the pow'rful sun</l>
     <l n="68">High in the heav'ns sends forth his strengthen 'd beams ,</l>
     <l n="69">And all the freshness of the morn is fled .</l>
     <l n="70">The sweating trav'ller throws his burden down ,</l>
     <l n="71">And leans his weary shoulder ‘ gainst a tree .</l>
     <l n="72">The idle horse upon the grassy field</l>
     <l n="73">Rolls on his back , nor heeds the tempting clover .</l>
     <l n="74">The swain leaves off his labour , and returns</l>
     <l n="75">Slow to his house with heavy sober steps ,</l>
     <l n="76">Where on the board his ready breakfast plac 'd ,</l>
     <l n="77">Invites the eye , and his right cheerful wife</l>
     <l n="78">Doth kindly serve him with unfeign 'd good will .</l>
     <l n="79">No sparkling dew-drops hang upon the grass ;</l>
     <l n="80">Forth steps the mower with his glitt'ring scythe ,</l>
     <l n="81">In snowy shirt , and doublet all unbrac 'd ,</l>
     <l n="82">White moves he o'er the ridge , with sideling bend ,</l>
     <l n="83">And lays the waving grass in many a heap .</l>
     <l n="84">In ev'ry field , in ev'ry swampy mead ,</l>
     <l n="85">The cheerful voice of industry is heard ;</l>
     <l n="86">The hay-cock rises , and the frequent rake</l>
     <l n="87">Sweeps on the yellow hay , in heavy wreaths ,</l>
     <l n="88">Leaving the smooth green meadow bare behind .</l>
     <l n="89">The old and young , the weak and strong are there ,</l>
     <l n="90">And , as they can , help on the cheerful work .</l>
     <l n="91">The father jeers his awkward half-grown lad ,</l>
     <l n="92">Who trails his tawdry armful o'er the field ,</l>
     <l n="93">Nor does he fear the jeering to repay .</l>
     <l n="94">The village oracle , and simple maid ,</l>
     <l n="95">Jest in their turns , and raise the ready laugh ;</l>
     <l n="96">For there authority , hard favour 'd , frowns not ;</l>
     <l n="97">All are companions in the gen'ral glee ,</l>
     <l n="98">And cheerful complaisance still thro ’ their roughness ,</l>
     <l n="99">With placid look enlightens ev'ery face .</l>
     <l n="100">Some more advanced raise the tow'ring rick ,</l>
     <l n="101">Whilst on its top doth stand the parish toast</l>
     <l n="102">In loose attire , and swelling ruddy cheek ;</l>
     <l n="103">With taunts and harmless mock'ry she receives</l>
     <l n="104">The toss'dhYpppHeNup heaps from the brown gaping youth ,</l>
     <l n="105">Who flaring at her , takes his aim awry ,</l>
     <l n="106">Whilst half the load comes tumbling on himself .</l>
     <l n="107">Loud is her laugh , her voice is heard afar ;</l>
     <l n="108">Each mower , busied in the distant field ,</l>
     <l n="109">The carter , trudging on his distant way ,</l>
     <l n="110">The shrill found know , cad up their hats in air ,</l>
     <l n="111">And roar across the fields to catch her notice :</l>
     <l n="112">She waves her arm , and shakes her head at them ,</l>
     <l n="113">And then renews her work with double spirit .</l>
     <l n="114">Thus do they jest , and laugh away their toil ,</l>
     <l n="115">Till the bright sun , full in his middle course ,</l>
     <l n="116">Shoots down his fiercest beams , which none may brave .</l>
     <l n="117">The stoutest arm hangs listless by its side ,</l>
     <l n="118">And the broad shoulder 'd youth begins to fail .</l>
     <l n="119">But to the weary , lo ! there comes relief !</l>
     <l n="120">A troop of welcome children , o'er the lawn ,</l>
     <l n="121">With slow and wary steps , their burthens bring .</l>
     <l n="122">Some bear upon their heads large baskets , heap 'd</l>
     <l n="123">With piles of barley bread , and gusty cheese ,</l>
     <l n="124">And some full pots of milk and cooling whey .</l>
     <l n="125">Beneath the branches of a spreading tree ,</l>
     <l n="126">Or by the shad'wy side of the tall rick ,</l>
     <l n="127">They spread their homely fare , and seated round ,</l>
     <l n="128">Taste all the pleasure that a feast can give .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="129">A drowzy indolence now hangs on all ,</l>
     <l n="130">And ev'ry creature seeks some place of rest ,</l>
     <l n="131">Screen 'd from the violence of the oppressive heat .</l>
     <l n="132">No scatter 'd flocks are seen upon the lawn ,</l>
     <l n="133">Nor chirping birds among the bushes heard .</l>
     <l n="134">Within the narrow shadow of the cot</l>
     <l n="135">The sleepy dog lies stretched on his side ,</l>
     <l n="136">Nor heeds the heavy-footed passenger ;</l>
     <l n="137">At noise of feet but half his eye-lid lifts ,</l>
     <l n="138">Then gives a feeble growl , and sleeps again :</l>
     <l n="139">Whilst puss , less nice , e'en in the scorching window ,</l>
     <l n="140">On t'other side , sits winking to the sun .</l>
     <l n="141">No sound is heard but humming of the bee ,</l>

     <l n="147">And the high branches of the slender poplar</l>
     <l n="148">Shiver aloft in air their rustling leaves .</l>
     <l n="149">Cool breaths the rising breeze , and with it wakes</l>
     <l n="150">The worn out spirit from its state of stupor .</l>
     <l n="151">The lazy boy springs from his mossy bed ,</l>
     <l n="152">To chace the gaudy tempting butterfly ,</l>

   <p>A STORY OF OTHER TIMES .</p>
   <p>SOMEWHAT IN IMITATION OF THE POEMS OF OSSIAN .</p>
   <p>LATHMOR . But why do'st thou stop on the way , and hold me thus hard in thy grasp ? It was but the voice of the winds from the deep narrow glens of Glanarven .</p>
   <p>ALLEN . The heath is unruffled around , and the oak o'er thy head is at rest : Calm swells the moon on the lake , and nothing is heard in the reeds . Sad was the sound , O my father ! but it was not the voice of the wind .</p>
   <p>LATHMOR . What dark tow'ring rock do I see ‘ midst the grey spreading mist of the hills ? This is not the vale of Clanarven : my son , we have err 'd from the way ,</p>
   <p>ALLEN . It is not a dark tow'ring rock , ‘ midst the grey settled mist of the hills . ‘ Tis a dark tow'r of strength which thou seest , and the ocean spreads dimly behind it .</p>
   <p>LATHMOR . Then here will we stop for the night , for the tow'r of Arthula is near . Proceed not , my son , on the way , for it was not the voice of the wind . The ghost of the valliant is forth ; and it mourns round the place of its woe . The tray'ller oft ’ hears it at midnight , and turns him aside from its haunt . The sharp moon is spent in her course , and the way of the desert is doubtful . This oak with his wide leavy branches will shelter our heads from the night ; And I 'll tell thee a story of old , since the tow'r of Arthula is near .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">From the walls of his strength came Lochallen , with his broad chested sons</l>
     <l n="2">of the hills .</l>
     <l n="3">He was strong as a bull of the forest , and keen as a bird of the rock .</l>
     <l n="4">His friends of the chace were around him , the sons of the heroes of Mora .</l>
     <l n="5">They were clad in the strength of their youth ; and the sound of their arms</l>
     <l n="6">rung afar .</l>
     <l n="7">For Uthal had led his dark host from the blue misty isle of his power ;</l>
     <l n="8">And o'erspread like a cloud of the desert , the land of the white-headed</l>
     <l n="9">Lorma .</l>
     <l n="10">Of Lorma who sat in the hall , and lamented the sons of his youth ;</l>
     <l n="11">For Orvina remained alone to support the frail steps of his age .</l>
     <l n="12">He sent to the king of Ithona : he remembered the love of his father :</l>
     <l n="13">And Lochallen soon join 'd him on Loarn with the high minded chieftains of</l>
     <l n="14">Mora .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="15">Loud was the sound of the battle , and many the slain of the field .</l>
     <l n="16">Red was the sword of Lochallen : it was red with the blood of the brave .</l>
     <l n="17">For his eye sought the combat of heroes , and the mighty withstood not his</l>
     <l n="18">arm .</l>
     <l n="19">He rag 'd like a flame on the heath ; and the enemy fled from his face .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="20">But short was the triumph of Lorma ; the hour of his fading was near .</l>
     <l n="21">Whilst a bard rais 'd the song of the battle , his dim eyes were closed in</l>
     <l n="22">death .</l>
     <l n="23">He fell like a ruined tow'r ; like a fragment of times that are past :</l>
     <l n="24">Like a rock whose foundation is worn with the lashes of many a wave .</l>
     <l n="25">Four grey head warriors of Lorma remain 'd from the days of his youth :</l>
     <l n="26">They mourn 'd o'er the fall of their lord ; and they bore him to his dark</l>
     <l n="27">narrow house .</l>
     <l n="28">His memorial was rais 'd on the hill ; and the lovely Orvina wept over it .</l>
     <l n="29">She bent her fair form o'er the heap ; and her sorrow was silent , and</l>
     <l n="30">gentle .</l>
     <l n="31">It flow 'd like the pure twinkling dream beneath the green shade of the</l>
     <l n="32">fern .</l>
     <l n="33">The hunters oft bless it at noon , tho ’ the strangers perceive not its</l>
     <l n="34">course .</l>
     <l n="35">The wind of the hill rais 'd her locks , and Lochallen beheld her in grief .</l>
     <l n="36">The soul of the hero was knit to the tear-eyed daughter of Lorma .</l>
     <l n="37">She was graceful and tall as the willow , that bends o'er the deep shady</l>
     <l n="38">stream .</l>
     <l n="39">Her eye like a sun-beam on water , that gleams thro ’ the dark skirting</l>
     <l n="40">reeds .</l>
     <l n="41">Her hair like the light wreathing cloud , that floats on the brow of the</l>
     <l n="42">hill ,</l>
     <l n="43">When the beam of the morning is there , and it scatters its skirts to the</l>
     <l n="44">wind .</l>
     <l n="45">Lovely and soft were her smiles , like a glimpse from the white riven</l>
     <l n="46">cloud ,</l>
     <l n="47">When the sun hastens over the lake , and a summer show'r ruffles its bosom .</l>
     <l n="48">Her voice was the sweet sound of midnight , that visits the ear of the</l>
     <l n="49">bard ,</l>
     <l n="50">When he darts from the place of his slumber , and calls on some far distant</l>
     <l n="51">friend .</l>
     <l n="52">She was fair ‘ mongst the maids of her time ; and she soften 'd the wrath of</l>
     <l n="53">the mighty .</l>
     <l n="54">Their eyes lighten 'd up in her presence ; they dropt their dark spears as</l>
     <l n="55">she spoke .</l>
     <l n="56">Lochallen was firm in his strength , and unmov 'd in the battle of heroes ;</l>
     <l n="57">Like a rock-fenced isle of the ocean , that shews its dark head thro ’ the</l>
     <l n="58">storm .</l>
     <l n="59">His brow was like a cliff on the shore , that fore-warneth the hunters of</l>
     <l n="60">Ithona ;</l>
     <l n="61">For there gleams the first ray of morning , and there broods the mist ere</l>
     <l n="62">the storm :</l>
     <l n="63">It shone , and it darken 'd by turns , as the strength of his passions arose .</l>
     <l n="64">He was terrible as a gathering storm , when his soul learnt the wrongs of</l>
     <l n="65">the feeble .</l>
     <l n="66">His eye was the lightning of shields ; he was swift as a blast in its</l>
     <l n="67">course .</l>
     <l n="68">When the warriours return 'd from the field , and the sons of the mighty</l>
     <l n="69">assembled ,</l>
     <l n="70">He was graceful as the light tow'ring cloud that rises from the blue</l>
     <l n="71">bounded main .</l>
     <l n="72">Gentle and fair was his form in the tow'rs of the hilly Ithona .</l>
     <l n="73">His voice cheer 'd the soul of the sad ; he would sport with a child in the</l>
     <l n="74">hall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="75">Matchless in the days of their love were Lochallen and the daughter of</l>
     <l n="76">Lorma .</l>
     <l n="77">But their beauty has ceas 'd on Arthula ; and the place of their rest is</l>
     <l n="78">unknown .</l>
     <l n="79">The family of Lorma has fail 'd , and strangers rejoice in his hall :</l>
     <l n="80">But voices of sorrow are heard when the stillness of midnight is there ;</l>
     <l n="81">The stranger is wak 'd with the sound , and enquires of the race that is</l>
     <l n="82">gone .</l>
     <l n="83">But wherefore thus doleful and sad , do ye wander alone on Arthula ?</l>
     <l n="84">Why look ye thus lonely and sad , ye children of the dark narrow house ?</l>
     <l n="85">Your names shall be known in the song , when the fame of the mighty is low .</l>

   <p>ALLEN . From what cloud of the hills do they look ? for I see not their forms , O my father !</p>
   <p>LATHMOR . Why do'st thou tremble my son ? thou hast fought in the battle of shields . They look 'd from no cloud of the hills ; but the soul of thy father beheld them . Lochallen return 'd from the field , to the sea-beaten tower of Arthula . Five days he abode in the hall , and they pass 'd like a glimpse of the sun , When the clouds of the tempest are rent , and the green island smiles ‘ midst the storm . On the sixth a cloud hung on his brow , and his eye shun 'd the looks of his friends . He spoke to the maid of his soul , and the trouble of his bosom was great . Pleasant is the hall of my love ; but the storm gathers round us , Orvina . I must go to the island of Uthal , and scatter his gathering force . But like a cleft oak of the forest , I 'll quickly return to my love : When the hard wedge is drawn from its side , it returns to itself again . The daughter of Lorma was silent : she turn 'd her fair face from his sight . Go to the war , son of Mora ; and the strength of thy fathers go with thee . I will sit on the high rocky shore , and look o'er the wide foaming sea . I will watch ev'ry blue rising cloud , till I see thy dark vessels return .</p>

     <l n="1">He gather 'd his warriours around him ; they darken 'd the brown rugged</l>
     <l n="2">shore .</l>
     <l n="3">The rocks echo 'd wide to their cries , and loud was the dashing of oars .</l>
     <l n="4">Orvina stood high on a rock , that hung o'er the deep lashing main ;</l>
     <l n="5">Big swell 'd the tear in her eye , and high heav 'd the sighs of her bosom ;</l>
     <l n="6">As she saw the white billows encreasing between his dark ship and the</l>
     <l n="7">shore .</l>
     <l n="8">Her fixed eye follow 'd its course o'er many a far distant wave ,</l>
     <l n="9">Till its broad sails , and high tow'ring mast but appear 'd like a speck on</l>
     <l n="10">the waters ;</l>
     <l n="11">Yet still she beheld in her fancy the form of her love on its side ;</l>
     <l n="12">And she stretched her white arms to the ocean , and wav 'd her loose girdle</l>
     <l n="13">on high .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="14">Soon reach 'd the sons of Ithona the blue misty isle of their foe .</l>

     <l n="16">night ;</l>
     <l n="17">Who snuff up the air of the morning , and rejoice at the voice of the</l>
     <l n="18">chace ;</l>
     <l n="19">They leapt from the sides of their vessels , and spread o'er the wide</l>
     <l n="20">sounding shore .</l>
     <l n="21">Thick on the brown heathy plain , were spread the dark thousands of Uthal .</l>
     <l n="22">The warriours of Lochallen were few , but their fathers were known in the</l>
     <l n="23">song .</l>
     <l n="24">Like a small rapid stream of the hills when it falls on the broad settled</l>
     <l n="25">lake ,</l>
     <l n="26">And troubles its dark muddy bosom , and dashes its waters aloft ,</l>
     <l n="27">So rush 'd the keen sons of Ithona on the thick gather 'd host of the foe .</l>

     <l n="32">round him .</l>
     <l n="33">Come forth in thy might , said Lochallen ; come forth to the combat of</l>
     <l n="34">kings .</l>
     <l n="35">Great is the might of thy warriours ; but where is the strength of thine</l>

     <l n="37">Youth of Ithona , said Uthal , thy fathers were mighty in battle ,</l>

     <l n="55">Bloody and long was the fight , but the arm of Lochallen prevail 'd .</l>
     <l n="56">Ah , why did you combat , ye heroes ! ah , why did ye meet in the field !</l>
     <l n="57">Your souls had been brothers of love , had ye met in the dwellings of</l>

     <l n="112">The watch dog howls to the night , nor heeds the approach of our feet .</l>
     <l n="113">He seized a bright flaming brand , and he hasten 'd his steps to the tow'r .</l>
     <l n="114">Wide stood the black low'ring gate ; and deep was the silence within .</l>
     <l n="115">Hollow and loud rung his steps , as he trode thro ’ the dark empty hall .</l>
     <l n="116">He flew to the bow'r of his love ; it was still as the chamber of death .</l>
     <l n="117">His eyes search 'd wildly around him ; he call 'd on the name of his love ;</l>
     <l n="118">But his own voice returned alone from the deep-sounding walls of the</l>
     <l n="119">tow'r .</l>
     <l n="120">He leant with his back to the wall , and cross 'd his arms over his breast .</l>
     <l n="121">Heavy sunk his head on his shoulder : the blue flame burnt double before</l>
     <l n="122">him .</l>
     <l n="123">A voice , like the evening breeze when it steals down the bed of the river ,</l>
     <l n="124">Came softly and sad to his ear , and he raised his drooping head .</l>
     <l n="125">The form of his love stood before him : yet it was not the form of his</l>
     <l n="126">love ;</l>
     <l n="127">For fixed and dim was her eye , and the beams of her beauty were fled .</l>
     <l n="128">She was pale as the white frozen lake , when it gleams to the light of the</l>
     <l n="129">moon .</l>
     <l n="130">Her garments were heavy and drench 'd , and the streams trickled fast from</l>
     <l n="131">her hair .</l>
     <l n="132">She was like a snow-crusted tree in winter , when it drops to the mid-day</l>
     <l n="133">sun .</l>
     <l n="134">O seek not for me , son of Moro , in the light cheerful dwellings of men !</l>
     <l n="135">For low is my bed in the deep , and cold is the place of my rest .</l>
     <l n="136">The sea monster sports by my side , and the water-snake twines round my</l>
     <l n="137">neck .</l>
     <l n="138">But do not forget me , Lochallen : O think on the days of our love !</l>
     <l n="139">I sat on the high rocky shore , mine eyes look 'd afar o'er the ocean .</l>
     <l n="140">I saw two dark ships on the waves , and quick beat the joy of my breast .</l>
     <l n="141">One vessel drew near to the shore , and six warriours leapt from its side .</l>
     <l n="142">I hasten 'd to meet thee , my love ; but mine ear met the stern voice of</l>
     <l n="143">Uthal .</l>
     <l n="144">I thought that my hero was slain , and I felt me alone in my weakness .</l>
     <l n="145">I felt me deserted and lonely : I flew to the steep hanging rock :</l>
     <l n="146">I threw my robe over my head ; and I hid me in the dark closing deep .</l>
     <l n="147">Yet O do not leave me , Lochallen , to waste in my watery bed !</l>
     <l n="148">But raise me a tomb on the hill , where the daughter of Lorma should lie .</l>
     <l n="149">The voice of her sorrow did cease ; and her form passed quickly away .</l>
     <l n="150">It pass 'd like the pale shiv'ring light , that is lost in the dark closing</l>
     <l n="151">cloud .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>But , lo ! the first light of the morning is red on the skirts of the heavens . Let us go on my journey , my son , for the length of the heath is before us .</p>
   <p>ALLEN . It is not the light of the morn which thou see'st on the skirts of the heavens ; It is but a clear shiv'ring brightness , that changes its hue to the night . I have seen it like a bloody-spread robe when it hung o'er the waves of the North . Sad was the fate of his love , but how fell the king of Ithona ? I have heard of the strength of his arm ; did he fall in the battle of heroes ?</p>
   <p>LATHMOR . He fell in the strength of his youth , but he fell not in battle , my son . He knew not the sword of a foe , yet he died not the death of the peaceful . They carried them both to the hill , but the place of their rest is unknown .</p>
   <p>ALLEN . But feeble and spent is thy voice , thou grey haired bard of the hill .</p>
   <p>LATHMOR . Long is this song of the night , and I feel not the strength of my youth .</p>
   <p>ALLEN . Then let us go on our way : let us go by the way of the heath . For it is the fair light of the morning which thou see'st on the far bounding waves . Slowly it grows in its beauty , and promises good to the traveller . Red are the small broken clouds that hang on the skirts of the heavens . Deep glows the clear open sky with the light of the yet hidden sun , Save where the dark narrow cloud hath stretched its vast length o'er the heavens ; And the clear ruddy brightness behind it looks fair thro ’ its blue streaming lines . A bloom like the far distant heath is dark on the wide roving clouds . The broad wavy breast of the ocean is grand in the beauty of morning . Thick rests the white settled mist on the deep rugged clifts of the shore ; And the grey rocks look dimly between , like the high distant isles in a calm . But grim low'r the walks of Arthula ; the light of the morn is behind them .</p>
   <p>LATHMOR . Dark low'rs the tow'r of Arthula : the time of its glory is past . The valiant have ceas 'd from its hall ; and the son of the stranger is there . The works of the mighty remain , but they are the vapour of morning .</p>
