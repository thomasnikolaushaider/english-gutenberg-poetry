    <head>TO LADY HESKETH .</head>
     <l n="1">The Lodge , May 27 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Coz ,— I , who am neither dead , nor sick , nor idle , should have no excuse , were I as tardy in answering as you in writing . I live indeed where leisure abounds , and you where leisure is not ; a difference that accounts sufficiently both for your silence and my loquacity .</p>
   <p>When you told Mrs. —— that my Homer would come forth in May , you told her what you believed , and therefore no falsehood . But you told her at the same time what will not happen , and therefore not a truth . There is a medium between truth and falsehood ; and I believe the word mistake expresses it exactly . I will therefore say that you were mistaken . If instead of May you had mentioned June , I flatter myself that you would have hit the mark . For in June there is every probability that we shall publish . You will say , “ Hang the printer !— for it is his fault ! ” But stay , my dear , hang him not just now ! For to execute him and find another will cost us time , and so much too , that I question if , in that case , we should publish sooner than in August . To say truth , I am not perfectly sure that there will be any necessity to hang him at all ; though that is a matter which I desire to leave entirely at your discretion , alleging only , in the meantime , that the man does not appear to me during the last half-year to have been at all in fault . His remittance of sheets in all that time has been punctual , save and except while the Easter holidays lasted , when I suppose he found it impossible to keep his devils to their business . I shall however receive the last sheet of the Odyssey to-morrow , and have already sent up the Preface , together with all the needful . You see , therefore , that the publication of this famous work cannot be delayed much longer .</p>
   <p>As for politics , I reck not , having no room in my head for any thing but the Slave bill . That is lost ; and all the rest is a trifle . I have not seen Paine 's book ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 589 ]</span>but refused to see it , when it was offered to me . No man shall convince me that I am improperly governed while I feel the contrary .</p>

   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— Now you may rest . Now I can give you joy of the period , of which I gave you hope in my last ; the period of all your labours in my service .<span type="note_anchor">[ 590 ]</span>But this I can foretell you also , that , if you persevere in serving your friends at this rate , your life is likely to be a life of labour . Yet persevere ! Your rest will be the sweeter hereafter ! In the meantime I wish you , if at any time you should find occasion for him , just such a friend as you have proved to me !</p>

   <p>PART THE THIRD .</p>
   <p>Having now arrived at that period in the history of Cowper , when he had brought to a close his great and laborious undertaking , his version of Homer , we suspend for a moment the progress of the correspondence , to afford room for a few observations .</p>
   <p>We have seen in many of the preceding letters , with what ardour of application and liveliness of hope he devoted himself to this favourite project of enriching the literature of his country with an English Homer , that might justly be esteemed a faithful yet free translation ; a genuine and graceful representative of the justly admired original .</p>
   <p>After five years of intense labour , from which nothing could withhold him , except the pressure of that unhappy malady which retarded his exertions for several months , he published his complete version in two quarto volumes , on the first of July , 1791 , having inscribed the Iliad to his young noble kinsman , Earl Cowper , and the Odyssey to the dowager Countess Spencer — a lady for whose virtues he had long entertained a most cordial and affectionate veneration .</p>
   <p>He had exerted no common powers of genius and of industry in this great enterprise , yet , we lament to say , he failed in satisfying the expectations of the public . Hayley assigns a reason for this failure , which we give in his own words . “ Homer , ” he observes , “ is so exquisitely beautiful in his own language , and he has been so long an idol in every literary mind , that any copy of him , which the best of modern poets can execute , must probably resemble in its effect the portrait of a graceful woman , painted by an excellent artist for her lover : the lover indeed will acknowledge great merit in the work , and think himself much indebted to the skill of such an artist , but he will never admit , as in truth he never can feel , that the best of resemblances exhibits all the grace that he discerns in the beloved original . ”</p>
   <p>This illustration is ingenious and amusing , but we doubt its justness ; because the painter may produce a correct and even a flattering likeness of the lover 's mistress , though it is true that the lover himself will think otherwise . But where is the translator that can do justice to the merits of Homer ? Who can exhibit his majestic simplicity , his sententious force , the lofty grandeur of his conceptions , and the sweet charm of his imagery , embellished with all the graces of a language never surpassed either in harmony or richness ? The two competitors , who are alone entitled to be contrasted with each other , are Pope and Cowper . We pass over Ogilby , Chapman , and others . It is Hector alone that is worthy to contend with Achilles . To the version of Pope must be allowed the praise of melody of numbers , richness of poetic diction , splendour of imagery , and brilliancy of effect ; but these merits are acquired at the expense of fidelity and justness of interpretation . The simplicity of the heroic ages is exchanged for the refinement of modern taste , and Homer sinks under the weight of ornaments not his own . Where Pope fails , Cowper succeeds ; but , on the other hand , where Pope succeeds , Cowper seems to fail . Cowper is more faithful , but less rich and spirited . He is singularly exempt from the defects attributable to Pope . There is nothing extraneous , no meretricious ornament , no laboured elegance , nothing added , nothing omitted . The integrity of the text is happily preserved . But though it is in the page of Cowper that we must seek for the true interpretation of Homer 's meaning — though there are many passages distinguished by much grace and beauty — yet , on the whole , the lofty spirit , the bright glow of feeling , the “ thoughts that breathe , the words that burn , ” are not sufficiently sustained . Each of these distinguished writers , to a certain extent , has failed , not from any want of genius , but because complete success is difficult , if not unattainable . Two causes may perhaps be assigned for this failure ; first , no copy can equal the original , if the original be the production of a master artist . The poet who seeks to transfuse into his own page the meaning and spirit of an author , endowed with extraordinary powers , resembles the chemist in his laboratory , who , in endeavouring to condense the properties of different substances , and to extract their essence , has the misfortune to see a great portion of the volatile qualities evaporate in the process , and elude all the efforts of his philosophic art . Secondly , Homer still remains untranslated , because of all poets he is the most untranslateable . He seems to claim the lofty prerogative of standing alone , and of enjoying the solitary grandeur of his own unrivalled genius ; allowing neither to rival nor to friend , to imitator nor to translator , the honours of participation ; but exercising the exclusive right of interpreting the majestic simplicity of his own conceptions , in all the fervour of his own poetic fancy , and in the sweet melody of his own graceful and flowing numbers . He who wishes to understand and to appreciate Homer , must seek him in the charm and beauty of his own inimitable language .</p>
   <p>As Cowper 's versions of the Iliad and Odyssey have formed so prominent a feature in his correspondence , for five successive years , we think it may be interesting to subjoin a few specimens from each translator , restricting our quotations to the Iliad , as being the most familiar to the reader .</p>
   <p>We extract passages , where poetic skill was most likely to be exerted .</p>

   <p>We leave the reader to form his own decision as to the relative merits of the two translations . Pope evidently produces effect by expanding the sentiments and imagery of his author ; Cowper invariably adheres to the original text .

    <head>TO THE REV . MR. HURDIS .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , June 13 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— I ought to have thanked you for your agreeable and entertaining letter much sooner , but I have many correspondents who will not be said nay ; and have been obliged of late to give my last attentions to Homer . The very last indeed , for yesterday I despatched to town , after revising them carefully , the proof sheets of subscribers ’ names , among which I took special notice of yours , and am much obliged to you for it . We have contrived , or rather my bookseller and printer have contrived ( for they have never waited a moment for me ) to publish as critically at the wrong time , as if my whole interest and success had depended upon it . March , April , and May , said Johnson to me in a letter that I received from him in February , are the best months for publication . Therefore now it is determined that Homer shall come out on the first of July ; that is to say , exactly at the moment when , except a few lawyers , not a creature will be left in town who will ever care one farthing about him . To which of these two friends of mine I am indebted for this management , I know not . It does not please , but I would be a philosopher as well as a poet , and therefore make no complaint , or grumble at all about it . You , I presume , have had dealings with them both — how did they manage for you ? And , if as they have for me , how did you behave under it ? Some who love me complain that I am too passive ; and I should be glad of an opportunity to justify myself by your example . The fact is , should I thunder ever so loud , no efforts of that sort will avail me now ; therefore , like a good economist of my bolts , I choose to reserve them for more profitable occasions .</p>
   <p>I am glad to find that your amusements have been so similar to mine ; for in this instance too I seemed in need of somebody to keep me in countenance , especially in my attention and attachment to animals . All the notice that we lords of the creation vouchsafe to bestow on the creatures is generally to abuse them ; it is well , therefore , that here and there a man should be found a little womanish , or perhaps a little childish , in this matter , who will make some amends , by kissing and coaxing and laying them in one 's bosom . You remember the little ewe lamb , mentioned by the prophet Nathan ; the prophet perhaps invented the tale for the sake of its application to David 's conscience ; but it is more probable that God inspired him with it for that purpose . If he did , it amounts to a proof , that he does not overlook , but , on the contrary , much notices such little partialities and kindnesses to his dumb creatures , as we , because we articulate , are pleased to call them .</p>
   <p>Your sisters are fitter to judge than I , whether assembly-rooms are the places , of all others , in which the ladies may be studied to most advantage . I am an old fellow , but I had once my dancing days , as you have now , yet I could never find that I learned half so much of a woman 's real character by dancing with her as by conversing with her at home , where I could observe her behaviour at the table , at the fire-side , and in all the trying circumstances of domestic life . We are all good when we are pleased , but she is the good woman who wants not a fiddle to sweeten her . If I am wrong , the young ladies will set me right ; in the meantime I will not tease you with graver arguments on the subject , especially as I have a hope , that years , and the study of the Scripture , and His Spirit whose word it is , will , in due time , bring you to my way of thinking . I am not one of those sages who require that young men should be as old as themselves before they have time to be so .</p>
   <p>With my love to your fair sisters , I remain ,</p>
   <p>Dear Sir , most truly yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— If it will afford you any comfort that you have a share in my affections , of that comfort you may avail yourself at all times . You have acquired it by means which , unless I should have become worthless myself to an uncommon degree , will always secure you from the loss of it . You are learning what all learn , though few at so early an age , that man is an ungrateful animal ; and that benefits , too often , instead of securing a due return , operate rather as provocations to ill-treatment . This I take to be the summum malum of the human heart . Towards God we are all guilty of it more or less ; but between man and man , we may thank God for it , there are some exceptions . He leaves this peccant principle to operate , in some degree against himself , in all , for our humiliation , I suppose ; and because the pernicious effects of it in reality cannot injure him , he cannot suffer by them ; but he knows that , unless he should restrain its influence on the dealings of mankind with each other , the bonds of society would be dissolved , and all charitable intercourse at an end amongst us . It was said of Archbishop Cranmer , “ Do him an ill turn , and you make him your friend for ever ; ” of others it may be said , “ Do them a good one , and they will be for ever your enemies . ” It is the grace of God only that makes the difference .</p>
   <p>The absence of Homer ( for we have now shaken hands and parted ) is well supplied by three relations of mine from Norfolk — my cousin Johnson , an aunt of his ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 592 ]</span>and his sister .<span type="note_anchor">[ 593 ]</span>I love them all dearly , and am well content to resign to them the place in my attentions so lately occupied by the chiefs of Greece and Troy . His aunt and I have spent many a merry day together , when we were some forty years younger ; and we make shift to be merry together still . His sister is a sweet young woman , graceful , good-natured , and gentle , just what I had imagined her to be before I had seen her .<span type="note_anchor">[ 594 ]</span></p>

   <p>Dear Sir ,— Your letter and obliging present from so great a distance deserved a speedier acknowledgment , and should not have wanted one so long , had not circumstances so fallen out since I received them as to make it impossible for me to write sooner . It is indeed within this day or two that I have heard how , by the help of my bookseller , I may transmit an answer to you .</p>
   <p>My title-page , as it well might , misled you . It speaks me of the Inner Temple ; and so I am , but a member of that society only , not as an inhabitant . I live here almost at the distance of sixty miles from London , which I have not visited these eight-and-twenty years , and probably never shall again . Thus it fell out that Mr. Morewood had sailed again for America before your parcel reached me , nor should I ( it is likely ) have received it at all , had not a cousin of mine , who lives in the Temple , by good fortune received it first , and opened your letter ; finding for whom it was intended , he transmitted to me both that and the parcel . Your testimony of approbation of what I have published , coming from another quarter of the globe , could not but be extremely flattering , as was your obliging notice that “ The Task ” had been reprinted in your city . Both volumes , I hope , have a tendency to discountenance vice , and promote the best interests of mankind . But how far they shall be effectual to these invaluable purposes depends altogether on His blessing , whose truths I have endeavoured to inculcate . In the meantime I have sufficient proof , that readers may be pleased , may approve , and yet lay down the book unedified .</p>
   <p>During the last five years I have been occupied with a work of a very different nature , a translation of the Iliad and Odyssey into blank verse , and the work is now ready for publication . I undertook it , partly because Pope 's is too lax a version , which has lately occasioned the learned of this country to call aloud for a new one ; and partly because I could fall on no better expedient to amuse a mind too much addicted to melancholy .</p>
   <p>I send you , in return for the volumes with which you favoured me , three on religious subjects , popular productions that have not been long published , and that may not therefore yet have reached your country : “ The Christian Officer 's Panoply , by a marine officer ” — “ The Importance of the Manners of the Great , ” and “ An Estimate of the Religion of the Fashionable World . ” The two last are said to be written by a lady , Miss Hannah More , and are universally read by people of that rank to which she addresses them . Your manners , I suppose , may be more pure than ours , yet it is not unlikely that even among you may be found some to whom her strictures are applicable . I return you my thanks , sir , for the volumes you sent me , two of which I have read with pleasure , Mr. Edwards 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 595 ]</span>book , and the Conquest of Canaan . The rest I have not had time to read , except Dr. Dwight 's Sermon , which pleased me almost more than any that I have either seen or heard .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 595 ]</span>The celebrated American Edwards , well known for his two great works on “ The Freedom of the Human Will , ” and on “ Religious Affections . ” Dr. Dwight 's Sermons are a body of sound and excellent theology .</p>
   <p>I shall account a correspondence with you an honour , and remain , dear sir ,</p>
   <p>Your obliged and obedient servant , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— Considering the multiplicity of your engagements , and the importance , no doubt , of most of them , I am bound to set the higher value on your letters , and , instead of grumbling that they come seldom , to be thankful to you that they come at all . You are now going into the country , where , I presume , you will have less to do , and I am rid of Homer . Let us try , therefore , if , in the interval between the present hour and the next busy season ( for I , too , if I live , shall probably be occupied again ) , we can continue to exchange letters more frequently than for some time past .</p>
   <p>You do justice to me and Mrs. Unwin , when you assure yourself that to hear of your health will give us pleasure : I know not , in truth , whose health and well-being could give us more . The years that we have seen together will never be out of our remembrance ; and , so long as we remember them , we must remember you with affection . In the pulpit , and out of the pulpit , you have laboured in every possible way to serve us ; and we must have a short memory indeed for the kindness of a friend , could we by any means become forgetful of yours . It would grieve me more than it does to hear you complain of the effects of time , were not I also myself the subject of them . While he is wearing out you and other dear friends of mine he spares not me ; for which I ought to account myself obliged to him , since I should otherwise be in danger of surviving all that I have ever loved — the most melancholy lot that can befall a mortal . God knows what will be my doom hereafter ; but precious as life necessarily seems to a mind doubtful of its future happiness , I love not the world , I trust , so much as to wish a place in it when all my beloved shall have left it .</p>
   <p>You speak of your late loss in a manner that affected me much ; and when I read that part of your letter , I mourned with you and for you . But surely , I said to myself , no man had ever less reason to charge his conduct to a wife with any thing blameworthy . Thoughts of that complexion , however , are no doubt extremely natural on the occasion of such a loss ; and a man seems not to have valued sufficiently , when he possesses it no longer , what , while he possessed it , he valued more than life . I am mistaken , too , or you can recollect a time when you had fears , and such as became a Christian , of loving too much ; and it is likely that you have even prayed to be preserved from doing so . I suggest this to you as a plea against those self-accusations , which I am satisfied that you do not deserve , and as an effectual answer to them all . You may do well too to consider , that had the deceased been the survivor she would have charged herself in the same manner , and , I am sure you will acknowledge , without any sufficient reason . The truth is , that you both loved at least as much as you ought , and , I dare say , had not a friend in the world who did not frequently observe it . To love just enough , and not a bit too much , is not for creatures who can do nothing well . If we fail in duties less arduous , how should we succeed in this , the most arduous of all ?</p>
   <p>I am glad to learn from yourself that you are about to quit a scene that probably keeps your tender recollections too much alive . Another place and other company may have their uses : and , while your church is undergoing repair , its minister may be repaired also .</p>
   <p>As to Homer , I am sensible that , except as an amusement , he was never worth my meddling with ; but , as an amusement , he was to me invaluable . As such he served me more than five years ; and , in that respect , I know not where I shall find his equal . You oblige me by saying , that you will read him for my sake . I verily think that any person of a spiritual turn may read him to some advantage . He may suggest reflections that may not be unserviceable even in a sermon ; for I know not where we can find more striking exemplars of the pride , the arrogance , and the insignificance of man ; at the same time that , by ascribing all events to a divine interposition , he inculcates constantly the belief of a providence ; insists much on the duty of charity towards the poor and the stranger ; on the respect that is due to superiors , and to our seniors in particular ; and on the expedience and necessity of prayer and piety toward the gods , a piety mistaken , indeed , in its object , but exemplary for the punctuality of its performance . Thousands , who will not learn from scripture to ask a blessing either on their actions or on their food , may learn it , if they please , from Homer .</p>
   <p>My Norfolk cousins are now with us . We are both as well as usual ; and with our affectionate remembrances to Miss Catlett ,</p>
   <p>I remain sincerely yours , W. C .</p>
   <p>We are indebted to the kindness of a friend for the following letter :—</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO MRS. BODHAM , SOUTH GREEN , MATTISHALL , NORFOLK .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston-Underwood , July 7 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Cousin ,— Most true it is , however strange , that on the 25th of last month I wrote you a long letter , and verily thought I had sent it : but , opening my desk the day before yesterday , there I found it . Such a memory have I — a good one never , but at present worse than usual , my head being filled with the cares of publication ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 597 ]</span>and the bargain that I am making with my bookseller .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 597 ]</span>The publication of the translation of Homer .</p>
   <p>I am sorry that through this forgetfulness of mine you were disappointed , otherwise should not at all regret that my letter never reached you ; for it consisted principally of such reasons as I could muster to induce you to consent to a favourite measure to which you have consented without them . Your kindness and self-denying disinterestedness on this occasion have endeared you to us all , if possible , still the more , and are truly worthy of the Rose<span type="note_anchor">[ 598 ]</span>that used to sit smiling on my knee , I will not say how many years ago .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 598 ]</span>The name he gave to Mrs. Bodham when a child .</p>
   <p>Make no apologies , my dear , that thou dost not write more frequently ;— write when thou canst , and I shall be satisfied . I am sensible , as I believe I have already told you , that there is an awkwardness in writing to those with whom we have hardly ever conversed ; in consideration of which , I feel myself not at all inclined either to wonder at or to blame your silence . At the same time , be it known to you , that you must not take encouragement from this my great moderation , lest , disuse increasing the labour , you should at last write not at all .</p>
   <p>That I should visit Norfolk at present is not possible . I have heretofore pleaded my engagement to Homer as the reason , and a reason it was , while it subsisted , that was absolutely insurmountable . But there are still other impediments , which it would neither be pleasant to me to relate , nor to you to know , and which could not well be comprised in a letter . Let it suffice for me to say that , could they be imparted , you would admit the force of them . It shall be our mutual consolation , that , if we cannot meet at Mattishall , at least we may meet at Weston , and that we shall meet here with double satisfaction , being now so numerous .</p>
   <p>Your sister is well ; Kitty ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 599 ]</span>I think , better than when she came ; and Johnny<span type="note_anchor">[ 600 ]</span>ails nothing , except that if he eat a little more supper than usual , he is apt to be riotous in his sleep . We have an excellent physician at Northampton , whom our dear Catherine wishes to consult , and I have recommended it to Johnny to consult him at the same time . His nocturnal ailment is , I dare say , within the reach of medical advice ; and , because it may happen some time or other to be very hurtful to him , I heartily wish him cured of it . Light suppers and early rising perhaps might alone be effectual — but the latter is a difficulty that threatens not to be easily surmounted .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 599 ]</span>Miss Johnson , afterwards Mrs. Hewitt .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 600 ]</span>Mr. Johnson .</p>
   <p>We are all of one mind respecting you ; therefore I send the love of all , though I shall see none of the party till breakfast calls us together . Great preparation is making in the empty house . The spiders have no rest , and hardly a web is to be seen where lately there were thousands .</p>
   <p>I am , my dearest cousin , with best respects to Mr. Bodham , most affectionately yours ,</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I did not foresee , when I challenged you to a brisker correspondence , that a new engagement of all my leisure was at hand : a new and yet an old one . An interleaved copy of my Homer arrived soon after from Johnson , in which he recommended it to me to make any alterations that might yet be expedient , with a view to another impression . The alterations that I make are indeed but few , and they are also short ; not more , perhaps , than half a line in two thousand . But the lines are , I suppose , nearly forty thousand in all , and to revise them critically must consequently be a work of labour . I suspend it , however , for your sake , till the present sheet be filled , and that I may not seem to shrink from my own offer .</p>
   <p>Mr. Bean has told me that he saw you at Bedford , and gave us your reasons for not coming our way . It is well , so far as your own comfortable lodging and our gratification were concerned , that you did not ; for our house is brimful , as it has been all the summer , with my relations from Norfolk . We should all have been mortified , both you and we , had you been obliged , as you must have been , to seek a residence elsewhere .</p>
   <p>I am sorry that Mr. Venn 's<span type="note_anchor">[ 602 ]</span>labours below are so near to a conclusion . I have seen few men whom I could have loved more , had opportunity been given me to know him better . So , at least , I have thought as often as I have seen him . But when I saw him last , which is some years since , he appeared then so much broken that I could not have imagined that he would last so long . Were I capable of envying , in the strict sense of the word , a good man , I should envy him , and Mr. Berridge ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 603 ]</span>and yourself , who have spent , and while they last , will continue to spend , your lives in the service of the only Master worth serving ; labouring always for the souls of men , and not to tickle their ears , as I do . But this I can say — God knows how much rather I would be the obscure tenant of a lath-and-plaster cottage , with a lively sense of my interest in a Redeemer , than the most admired object of public notice without it . Alas ! what is a whole poem , even one of Homer 's , compared with a single aspiration that finds its way immediately to God , though clothed in ordinary language , or perhaps not articulated at all ! These are my sentiments as much as ever they were , though my days are all running to waste among Greeks and Trojans . The night cometh when no man can work ; and , if I am ordained to work to better purpose , that desirable period cannot be very distant . My day is beginning to shut in , as every man 's must who is on the verge of sixty .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 602 ]</span>The Rev . Henry Venn , successively vicar of Huddersfield , Yorkshire , and rector of Yelling , Huntingdonshire , eminent for his piety and usefulness . He was the author of “ The Complete Duty of Man , ” the design of which was to correct the deficiencies so justly imputable to “ The Whole Duty of Man , ” by laying the foundation of moral duties in the principles inculcated by the gospel . There is an interesting and valuable memoir of this excellent man , edited by the Rev . Henry Venn , B. D ., his grandson , which we recommend to the notice of the reader .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 603 ]</span>Mr. Berridge was vicar of Everton , Beds ; a most zealous and pious minister .</p>
   <p>All the leisure that I have had of late for thinking , has been given to the riots at Birmingham . What a horrid zeal for the church , and what a horrid loyalty to government , have manifested themselves there ! How little do they dream that they could not have dishonoured their idol , the Establishment , more , and that the great Bishop of souls himself with abhorrence rejects their service ! But I have not time to enlarge ; breakfast calls me ; and all my post-breakfast time must be given to poetry . Adieu !</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . WALTER BAGOT .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , August 2 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— I was much obliged , and still feel myself much obliged , to Lady Bagot for the visit with which she favoured me . Had it been possible that I could have seen Lord Bagot too , I should have been completely happy . For , as it happened , I was that morning in better spirits than usual , and , though I arrived late , and after a long walk , and extremely hot , which is a circumstance very apt to disconcert me , yet I was not disconcerted half so much as I generally am at the sight of a stranger , especially of a stranger lady , and more especially at the sight of a stranger lady of quality . When the servant told me that Lady Bagot was in the parlour , I felt my spirits sink ten degrees ; but , the moment I saw her , at least , when I had been a minute in her company , I felt them rise again , and they soon rose even above their former pitch . I know two ladies of fashion now whose manners have this effect upon me , the lady in question and the Lady Spencer . I am a shy animal , and want much kindness to make me easy . Such I shall be to my dying day .</p>
   <p>Here sit I , calling myself shy , yet have just published by the bye , two great volumes of poetry .</p>
   <p>This reminds me of Ranger 's observation in the “ Suspicious Husband , ” who says to somebody , I forget whom , “ There is a degree of assurance in you modest men that we impudent fellows can never arrive at . ” — Assurance , indeed ! Have you seen ‘ em ? What do you think they are ? Nothing less , I can tell you , than a translation of Homer , of the sublimest poet in the world . That 's all . Can I ever have the impudence to call myself shy again ?</p>
   <p>You live , I think , in the neighbourhood of Birmingham . What must you not have felt on the late alarming occasion ! You , I suppose , could see the fires from your windows . We , who only heard the news of them , have trembled . Never sure was religious zeal more terribly manifested or more to the prejudice of its own cause .<span type="note_anchor">[ 604 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 604 ]</span>The riots at Birmingham originated in the imprudent zeal of Dr. Priestley , and his adherents , the Unitarian dissenters , who assembled together at a public dinner , to commemorate the events of the French revolution . Toasts were given of an inflammatory tendency , and handbills were previously circulated of a similar character . The town of Birmingham , being distinguished for its loyalty , became deeply excited by these acts . The mob collected in great multitudes , and proceeded to the house of Dr. Priestley , which they destroyed with fire . All his valuable philosophical apparatus and manuscripts perished on this occasion . We concur with Cowper in lamenting such outrages .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear friend . I am , with Mrs. Unwin 's best compliments ,</p>
   <p>Ever yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Madam ,— Your last letter , which gave us so unfavourable an account of your health , and which did not speak much more comfortably of Mr. King 's , affected us with much concern . Of Dr. Raitt we may say , in the words of Milton ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ His long experience did attain</l>
     <l n="2">To something like prophetic strain ; ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>for as he foretold to you , so he foretold to Mrs. Unwin , that , though her disorders might not much threaten life , they would yet cleave to her to the last ; and she and perfect health must ever be strangers to each other . Such was his prediction , and it has been hitherto accomplished . Either head-ache or pain in the side has been her constant companion ever since we had the pleasure of seeing you . As for myself , I cannot properly say that I enjoy a good state of health , though in general I have it , because I have it accompanied with frequent fits of dejection , to which less health and better spirits would , perhaps , be infinitely preferable . But it pleased God that I should be born in a country where melancholy is the national characteristic . To say the truth , I have often wished myself a Frenchman .</p>
   <p>N. B. I write this in very good spirits .</p>
   <p>You gave us so little hope in your last , that we should have your company this summer at Weston , that to repeat our invitation seems almost like teasing you . I will only say , therefore , that , my Norfolk friends having left us , of whose expected arrival here I believe I told you in a former letter , we should be happy could you succeed them . We now , indeed , expect Lady Hesketh , but not immediately ; she seldom sees Weston till all its summer beauties are fled , and red , brown , and yellow , have supplanted the universal verdure .</p>
   <p>My Homer is gone forth , and I can devoutly say , “ Joy go with it ! ” What place it holds in the estimation of the generality I cannot tell , having heard no more about it since its publication than if no such work existed . I must except , however , an anonymous eulogium from some man of letters , which I received about a week ago . It was kind in a perfect stranger , as he avows himself to be , to relieve me , at so early a day , from much of the anxiety that I could not but feel on such an occasion . I should be glad to know who he is , only that I might thank him .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin , who is at this moment come down to breakfast , joins me in affectionate compliments to yourself and Mr. King ; and I am , my dear madam ,</p>
   <p>Most sincerely yours , W. C .</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . MR. HURDIS .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , August 9 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— I never make a correspondent wait for an answer through idleness , or want of proper respect for him ; but if I am silent it is because I am busy , or not well , or because I stay till something occur that may make my letter at least a little better than mere blank paper . I therefore write speedily in reply to yours , being at present neither much occupied , nor at all indisposed , nor forbidden by a dearth of materials .</p>
   <p>I wish always , when I have a new piece in hand , to be as secret as you , and there was a time when I could be so . Then I lived the life of a solitary , was not visited by a single neighbour , because I had none with whom I could associate ; nor ever had an inmate . This was when I dwelt at Olney ; but since I have removed to Weston the case is different . Here I am visited by all around me , and study in a room exposed to all manner of inroads . It is on the ground floor , the room in which we dine , and in which I am sure to be found by all who seek me . They find me generally at my desk , and with my work , whatever it be , before me , unless perhaps I have conjured it into its hiding-place before they have had time to enter . This , however , is not always the case ; and , consequently , sooner or later , I cannot fail to be detected . Possibly you , who I suppose have a snug study , would find it impracticable to attend to any thing closely in an apartment exposed as mine , but use has made it familiar to me , and so familiar , that neither servants going and coming disconcert me ; nor even if a lady , with an oblique glance of her eye , catches two or three lines of my MSS ., do I feel myself inclined to blush , though naturally the shyest of mankind .</p>
   <p>You did well , I believe , to cashier the subject of which you gave me a recital . It certainly wants those agrémens which are necessary to the success of any subject in verse . It is a curious story , and so far as the poor young lady was concerned a very affecting one ; but there is a coarseness in the character of the hero that would have spoiled all . In fact , I find it myself a much easier matter to write , than to get a convenient theme to write on .</p>
   <p>I am obliged to you for comparing me as you go both with Pope and with Homer . It is impossible in any other way of management to know whether the translation be well executed or not , and if well , in what degree . It was in the course of such a process that I first became dissatisfied with Pope . More than thirty years since , and when I was a young Templar , I accompanied him with his original , line by line , through both poems . A fellow student of mine , a person of fine classical taste , joined himself with me in the labour . We were neither of us , as you may imagine , very diligent in our proper business .</p>
   <p>I shall be glad if my reviewers , whosoever they may be , will be at the pains to read me as you do . I want no praise that I am not entitled to , but of that to which I am entitled I should be loath to lose a tittle , having worked hard to earn it .</p>

    <head>TO JOHN JOHNSON , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , Aug. 9 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— The little that I have heard about Homer myself has been equally or more flattering than Dr. —— ‘ s intelligence , so that I have good reason to hope that I have not studied the old Grecian , and how to dress him , so long and so intensely , to no purpose . At present I am idle , both on account of my eyes and because I know not to what to attach myself in particular . Many different plans and projects are recommended to me . Some call aloud for original verse , others for more translation , and others for other things . Providence , I hope , will direct me in my choice , for other guide I have none , nor wish for another .</p>
   <p>God bless you , my dearest Johnny , W. C .</p>
   <p>The active mind of Cowper , and the necessity of mental exertion , in order to arrest the terrible incursions of his depressing malady , soon led him to contract a new literary engagement . A splendid edition of Milton was at that time contemplated , intended to rival the celebrated Shakspeare of Boydell ; and to combine all the adventitious aid that editorial talent , the professional skill of a most distinguished artist , and the utmost embellishment of type could command , to ensure success . Johnson , the bookseller , invited the co-operation of Cowper , in the responsible office of Editor . For such an undertaking he was unquestionably qualified , by his refined critical taste and discernment , and by his profound veneration for this first of modern epic poets . Cowper readily entered into this project , and by his admirable translations of the Latin and Italian poems of Milton , justly added to the fame which he had already acquired . But to those who know how to appreciate his poetic powers , and his noble ardour in proclaiming the most important truths , it must ever be a source of unfeigned regret that the hours given to translation , and especially to Homer , were not dedicated to the composition of some original work . Who would not have hailed with delight another poem , rivalling all the beauties and moral excellences of “ The Task , ” and endearing to the mind , with still higher claims , the sweet poet of nature , and the graceful yet sublime teacher of heavenly truth and wisdom ?</p>

   <p>It was this literary engagement that first laid the foundation of that intercourse , which commenced at this time between Cowper and Hayley ; an intercourse which seems to have ripened into subsequent habits of friendship . As their names have been so much associated together , and Hayley eventually became the poet 's biographer , we shall record the circumstances of the origin of their intimacy in Hayley 's own words .</p>
   <p>“ As it is to Milton that I am in a great measure indebted for what I must ever regard as a signal blessing , the friendship of Cowper , the reader will pardon me for dwelling a little on the circumstances that produced it ; circumstances which often lead me to repeat those sweet verses of my friend , on the casual origin of our most valuable attachments :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Mysterious are his ways , whose power</l>
     <l n="2">Brings forth that unexpected hour ,</l>
     <l n="3">When minds that never met before ,</l>
     <l n="4">Shall meet , unite , and part no more :</l>
     <l n="5">It is th ’ allotment of the skies ,</l>
     <l n="6">The hand of the Supremely Wise ,</l>
     <l n="7">That guides and governs our affections ,</l>
     <l n="8">And plans and orders our connexions . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These charming verses strike with peculiar force on my heart , when I recollect , that it was an idle endeavour to make us enemies which gave rise to our intimacy , and that I was providentially conducted to Weston at a season when my presence there afforded peculiar comfort to my affectionate friend under the pressure of a domestic affliction , which threatened to overwhelm his very tender spirits .<span type="note_anchor">[ 608 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 608 ]</span>An alarming attack with which Mrs. Unwin was visited .</p>
   <p>“ The entreaty of many persons , whom I wished to oblige , had engaged me to write a Life of Milton , before I had the slightest suspicion that my work could interfere with the projects of any man ; but I was soon surprised and concerned in hearing that I was represented in a newspaper as an antagonist of Cowper .</p>
   <p>“ I immediately wrote to him on the subject , and our correspondence soon endeared us to each other in no common degree . ”</p>
   <p>We give credit to Hayley for the kind and amiable spirit which he manifested on this delicate occasion ; and for the address with which he converted an apparent collision of interests into a magnanimous triumph of literary and courteous feeling .</p>
   <p>The succeeding letters will be found to contain frequent allusions both to his past and newly contracted engagement .</p>

     <l n="1">The Lodge , Sept. 14 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— Whoever reviews me will in fact have a laborious task of it , in the performance of which he ought to move leisurely , and to exercise much critical discernment . In the meantime , my courage is kept up by the arrival of such testimonies in my favour as give me the greatest pleasure ; coming from quarters the most respectable . I have reason , therefore , to hope that our periodical judges will not be very averse to me , and that perhaps they may even favour me . If one man of taste and letters is pleased , another man so qualified can hardly be displeased ; and if critics of a different description grumble , they will not however materially hurt me .</p>
   <p>You , who know how necessary it is to me to be employed , will be glad to hear that I have been called to a new literary engagement , and that I have not refused it . A Milton , that is to rival , and , if possible , to exceed in splendour , Boydell 's Shakspeare , is in contemplation , and I am in the editor 's office . Fuseli is the painter . My business will be to select notes from others , and to write original notes ; to translate the Latin and Italian poems , and to give a correct text . I shall have years allowed me to do it in .</p>

     <l n="1">Weston , Sept. 21 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— Of all the testimonies in favour of my Homer that I have received , none has given me so sincere a pleasure as that of Lord Bagot . It is an unmixed pleasure , and without a drawback ; because I know him to be perfectly , and in all respects , whether erudition or a fine taste be in question , so well qualified to judge me , that I can neither expect nor wish a sentence more valuable than his —</p>
   <p>... εισοκ αυτμη Εν στηθεσσι μενει , και μοι φιλα γουνατ ορωρει .</p>
   <p>I hope by this time you have received your volumes , and are prepared to second the applauses of your brother — else , woe be to you ! I wrote to Johnson immediately on the receipt of your last , giving him a strict injunction to despatch them to you without delay . He had sold some time since a hundred of the unsubscribed-for copies .</p>
   <p>I have not a history in the world except Baker 's Chronicle , and that I borrowed three years ago from Mr. Throckmorton . Now the case is this : I am translating Milton 's third Elegy — his Elegy on the death of the Bishop of Winchester .<span type="note_anchor">[ 609 ]</span>He begins it with saying , that , while he was sitting alone , dejected , and musing on many melancholy themes , first , the idea of the Plague presented itself to his mind , and of the havoc made by it among the great . Then he proceeds thus :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Tum memini clarique ducis , fratrisque verendi</l>
     <l n="2">Intempestivis ossa cremata rogis :</l>
     <l n="3">Et memini Heroum quos vidit ad æthera raptos ;</l>
     <l n="4">Flevit et amissos Belgia tota duces .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I cannot learn from my only oracle , Baker , who this famous leader , and his reverend brother were . Neither does he at all ascertain for me the event alluded to in the second of these couplets . I am not yet possessed of Warton , who probably explains it , nor can be for a month to come . Consult him for me if you have him , or , if you have him not , consult some other . Or you may find the intelligence perhaps in your own budget ; no matter how you come by it , only send it to me if you can , and as soon as you can , for I hate to leave unsolved difficulties behind me .<span type="note_anchor">[ 610 ]</span>In the first year of Charles the First , Milton was seventeen years of age , and then wrote this elegy . The period therefore to which I would refer you , is the two or three last years of James the First .</p>

   <p>Dear Sir ,— We are truly concerned at your account of Mrs. King 's severe indisposition ; and , though you had no better news to tell us , are much obliged to you for writing to inform us of it , and to Mrs. King for desiring you to do it . We take a lively interest in what concerns her . I should never have ascribed her silence to neglect , had she neither written to me herself nor commissioned you to write for her . I had , indeed , for some time expected a letter from her by every post , but accounted for my continual disappointment by supposing her at Edgeware , to which place she intended a visit , as she told me long since , and hoped that she would write immediately on her return .</p>
   <p>Her sufferings will be felt here till we learn that they are removed ; for which reason we shall be much obliged by the earliest notice of her recovery , which we most sincerely wish , if it please God , and which will not fail to be a constant subject of prayer at Weston .</p>
   <p>I beg you , sir , to present Mrs. Unwin 's and my affectionate remembrances to Mrs. King , in which you are equally a partaker , and to believe me , with true esteem and much sincerity ,</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— You could not have sent me more agreeable news than that of your better health , and I am greatly obliged to you for making me the first of your correspondents to whom you have given that welcome intelligence . This is a favour which I should have acknowledged much sooner , had not a disorder in my eyes , to which I have always been extremely subject , required that I should make as little use of my pen as possible . I felt much for you , when I read that part of your letter in which you mention your visitors , and the fatigue which , indisposed as you have been , they could not fail to occasion you . Agreeable as you would have found them at another time , and happy as you would have been in their company , you could not but feel the addition they necessarily made to your domestic attentions as a considerable inconvenience . But I have always said , and shall never say otherwise , that if patience under adversity , and submission to the afflicting hand of God , be true fortitude — which no reasonable person can deny — then your sex have ten times more true fortitude to boast than ours ; and I have not the least doubt that you carried yourself with infinitely more equanimity on that occasion than I should have done , or any he of my acquaintance . Why is it , since the first offender on earth was a woman , that the women are nevertheless , in all the most important points , superior to the men ? That they are so I will not allow to be disputed , having observed it ever since I was capable of making the observation . I believe , on recollection , that , when I had the happiness to see you here , we agitated this question a little ; but I do not remember that we arrived at any decision of it . The Scripture calls you the weaker vessels ; and perhaps the best solution of the difficulty , therefore , may be found in those other words of Scripture — My strength is perfected in weakness . Unless you can furnish me with a better key than this , I shall be much inclined to believe that I have found the true one .</p>
   <p>I am deep in a new literary engagement , being retained by my bookseller as editor of an intended most magnificent publication of Milton 's Poetical Works . This will occupy me as much as Homer did for a year or two to come ; and when I have finished it , I shall have run through all the degrees of my profession , as author , translator , and editor . I know not that a fourth could be found ; but if a fourth can be found , I dare say I shall find it .</p>
   <p>I remain , my dear madam , your affectionate friend and humble servant ,</p>

     <l n="1">Weston , Oct. 25 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— Your unexpected and transient visit , like every thing else that is past , has now the appearance of a dream , but it was a pleasant one , and I heartily wish that such dreams could recur more frequently . Your brother Chester repeated his visit yesterday , and I never saw him in better spirits . At such times he has , now and then , the very look that he had when he was a boy , and when I see it I seem to be a boy myself , and entirely forget for a short moment the years that have intervened since I was one . The look that I mean is one that you , I dare say , have observed .— Then we are at Westminster again . He left with me that poem of your brother Lord Bagot 's which was mentioned when you were here . It was a treat to me , and I read it to my cousin Lady Hesketh and to Mrs. Unwin , to whom it was a treat also . It has great sweetness of numbers and much elegance of expression , and is just such a poem as I should be happy to have composed myself about a year ago , when I was loudly called upon by a certain nobleman<span type="note_anchor">[ 613 ]</span>to celebrate the beauties of his villa . But I had two insurmountable difficulties to contend with . One was that I had never seen his villa , and the other , that I had no eyes at that time for anything but Homer . Should I at any time hereafter undertake the task , I shall now at least know how to go about it , which , till I had seen Lord Bagot 's poem , I verily did not . I was particularly charmed with the parody of those beautiful lines of Milton :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The song was partial , but the harmony ——</l>
     <l n="2">( What could it less , when spirits immortal sing ? )</l>
     <l n="3">Suspended hell , and took with ravishment</l>
     <l n="4">The thronging audience . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There 's a parenthesis for you ! The parenthesis it seems is out of fashion , and perhaps the moderns are in the right to proscribe what they cannot attain to . I will answer for it that had we the art at this day of insinuating a sentiment in this graceful manner , no reader of taste would quarrel with the practice . Lord Bagot showed his by selecting the passage for his imitation .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 613 ]</span>Lord Bagot .</p>
   <p>I would beat Warton , if he were living , for supposing that Milton ever repented of his compliment to the memory of Bishop Andrews . I neither do , nor can , nor will believe it . Milton 's mind could not be narrowed by anything , and , though he quarrelled with episcopacy in the church of England idea of it , I am persuaded that a good bishop , as well as any other good man , of whatsoever rank or order , had always a share of his veneration .<span type="note_anchor">[ 614 ]</span></p>
   <p>Yours , my dear friend , Very affectionately , W. C .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 614 ]</span>How much more charitable is Cowper 's comment , than the injurious surmise of Warton !</p>

   <p>My dear Johnny ,— Your kind and affectionate letter well deserves my thanks , and should have had them long ago , had I not been obliged lately to give my attention to a mountain of unanswered letters , which I have just now reduced to a mole-hill ; yours lay at the bottom , and I have at last worked my way down to it .</p>
   <p>It gives me great pleasure that you have found a house to your minds . May you all three be happier in it than the happiest that ever occupied it before you ! But my chief delight of all is to learn that you and Kitty are so completely cured of your long and threatening maladies . I always thought highly of Dr. Kerr , but his extraordinary success in your two instances has even inspired me with an affection for him .</p>
   <p>My eyes are much better than when I wrote last , though seldom perfectly well many days together . At this season of the year I catch perpetual colds , and shall continue to do so till I have got the better of that tenderness of habit with which the summer never fails to affect me .</p>
   <p>I am glad that you have heard well of my work in your country . Sufficient proofs have reached me from various quarters that I have not ploughed the field of Troy in vain .</p>
   <p>Were you here , I would gratify you with an enumeration of particulars , but since you are not it must content you to be told that I have every reason to be satisfied .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin , I think , in her letter to Cousin Balls , made mention of my new engagement . I have just entered on it , and therefore can at present say little about it . It is a very creditable one in itself , and may I but acquit myself of it with sufficiency it will do me honour . The commentator 's part however is a new one to me , and one that I little thought to appear in . Remember your promise that I shall see you in the spring .</p>
   <p>The Hall has been full of company ever since you went , and at present my Catharina<span type="note_anchor">[ 615 ]</span>is there , singing and playing like an angel .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I have waited and wished for your opinion with the feelings that belong to the value that I have for it , and am very happy to find it so favourable . In my table-drawer I treasure up a bundle of suffrages sent me by those of whose approbation I was most ambitious , and shall presently insert yours among them .</p>
   <p>I know not why we should quarrel with compound epithets ; it is certain , at least , they are as agreeable to the genius of our language as to that of the Greek , which is sufficiently proved by their being admitted into our common and colloquial dialect . Black-eyed , nut-brown , crook-shanked , hump-backed , are all compound epithets , and , together with a thousand other such , are used continually , even by those who profess a dislike to such combinations in poetry . Why then do they treat with so much familiarity a thing that they say disgusts them ? I doubt if they could give this question a reasonable answer , unless they should answer it by confessing themselves unreasonable .</p>
   <p>I have made a considerable progress in the translation of Milton 's Latin poems . I give them , as opportunity offers , all the variety of measure that I can . Some I render in heroic rhyme , some in stanzas , some in seven and some in eight syllable measure , and some in blank verse . They will altogether , I hope , make an agreeable miscellany for the English reader . They are certainly good in themselves , and cannot fail to please but by the fault of their translator .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I am weary of making you wait for an answer , and therefore resolve to send you one , though without the lines you ask for . Such as they are , they have been long ready ; and could I have found a conveyance for them , should have been with you weeks ago . Mr. Bean 's last journey to town might have afforded me an opportunity to send them , but he gave me not sufficient notice . They must , therefore , be still delayed till either he shall go to London again or somebody else shall offer . I thank you for yours , which are as much better than mine as gold is better than feathers .</p>
   <p>It seemed necessary that I should account for my apparent tardiness to comply with the obliging request of a lady , and of a lady who employed you as her intermedium . None was wanted , as you well assured her . But had there been occasion for one , she could not possibly have found a better .</p>
   <p>I was much pleased with your account of your visit to Cowslip Green ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 617 ]</span>both for the sake of what you saw there , and because I am sure you must have been as happy in such company as any situation in this world can make you . Miss More has been always employed , since I first heard of her doings , as becomes a Christian . So she was while endeavouring to reform the unreformable great ; and so she is , while framing means and opportunities to instruct the more tractable little . Horace 's Virginibus , puerisque , may be her motto , but in a sense much nobler than he has annexed to it . I cannot , however , be entirely reconciled to the thought of her being henceforth silent , though even for the sake of her present labours .<span type="note_anchor">[ 618 ]</span>A pen useful as hers ought not , perhaps , to be laid aside ; neither , perhaps , will she altogether renounce it , but , when she has established her schools , and habituated them to the discipline she intends , will find it desirable to resume it . I rejoice that she has a sister like herself , capable of bidding defiance to fatigue and hardship , to dirty roads and wet raiment , in so excellent a cause .<span type="note_anchor">[ 619 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 617 ]</span>The residence of the late Mrs. Hannah More , near Bristol .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 619 ]</span>Mrs. Martha More .</p>
   <p>I beg that when you write next to either of those ladies , you will present my best compliments to Miss Martha , and tell her that I can never feel myself flattered more than I was by her application . God knows how unworthy I judge myself , at the same time , to be admitted into a collection<span type="note_anchor">[ 620 ]</span>of which you are a member . Were there not a crowned head or two to keep me in countenance , I should even blush to think of it .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 620 ]</span>Of autographs .</p>
   <p>I would that I could see some of the mountains which you have seen ; especially , because Dr. Johnson has pronounced that no man is qualified to be a poet who has never seen a mountain . But mountains I shall never see , unless perhaps in a dream , or unless there are such in heaven . Nor those , unless I receive twice as much mercy as ever yet was shown to any man .</p>
   <p>I am now deep in Milton , translating his Latin poems for a pompous edition , of which you have undoubtedly heard . This amuses me for the present , and will for a year or two . So long , I presume , I shall be occupied in the several functions that belong to my present engagement .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin and I are about as well as usual ; always mindful of you , and always affectionately so . Our united love attends yourself and Miss Catlett .</p>

     <l n="1">Weston-Underwood , Dec. 5 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— Your last brought me two cordials ; for what can better deserve that name than the cordial approbation of two such readers as your brother , the bishop , and your good friend and neighbour , the clergyman ? The former I have ever esteemed and honoured with the justest cause , and am as ready to honour and esteem the latter as you can wish me to be , and as his wishes and talents deserve . Do I hate a parson ? Heaven forbid ! I love you all when you are good for any thing , and , as to the rest , I would mend them if I could , and that is the worst of my intentions towards them .</p>
   <p>I heard above a month since that this first edition of my work was at that time nearly sold . It will not therefore , I presume , be long before I must go to press again . This I mention merely from an earnest desire to avail myself of all other strictures that either your good neighbour , Lord Bagot , the bishop , or yourself ,</p>
   <p>παντων εκπαγλοτατ ’ ανδρων ,</p>
   <p>may happen to have made , and will be so good as to favour me with . Those of the good Evander contained in your last have served me well , and I have already , in the three different places referred to , accommodated the text to them . And this I have done in one instance even a little against the bias of my own opinion .</p>
   <p>... εγω δε κεν αυτος ἑλωμαι ‘ Ελθων συν πλεομεσσι .</p>
   <p>The sense I had given of these words is the sense in which an old scholiast has understood them , as appears in Clarke 's note in loco . Clarke indeed prefers the other , but it does not appear plain to me that he does it with good reason against the judgment of a very ancient commentator and a Grecian . And I am the rather inclined to this persuasion , because Achilles himself seems to have apprehended that Agamemnon would not content himself with Briseis only , when he says ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">But I have OTHER precious things on board ,</l>
     <l n="2">Of THESE take NONE away without my leave , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is certain that the words are ambiguous , and that the sense of them depends altogether on the punctuation . But I am always under the correction of so able a critic as your neighbour , and have altered , as I say , my version accordingly .</p>
   <p>As to Milton , the die is cast . I am engaged , have bargained with Johnson , and cannot recede . I should otherwise have been glad to do as you advise , to make the translation of his Latin and Italian part of another volume ; for , with such an addition , I have nearly as much verse in my budget as would be required for the purpose . This squabble , in the meantime , between Fuseli and Boydell<span type="note_anchor">[ 621 ]</span>does not interest me at all ; let it terminate as it may , I have only to perform my job , and leave the event to be decided by the combatants .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— I am much obliged to you for wishing that I were employed in some original work rather than in translation . To tell the truth , I am of your mind ; and , unless I could find another Homer , I shall promise ( I believe ) and vow , when I have done with Milton , never to translate again . But my veneration for our great countryman is equal to what I feel for the Grecian ; and consequently I am happy , and feel myself honourably employed whatever I do for Milton . I am now translating his Epitaphium Damonis , a pastoral in my judgment equal to any of Virgil 's Bucolics , but of which Dr. Johnson ( so it pleased him ) speaks , as I remember , contemptuously . But he who never saw any beauty in a rural scene was not likely to have much taste for a pastoral . In pace quiescat !</p>
   <p>I was charmed with your friendly offer to be my advocate with the public ; should I want one , I know not where I could find a better . The reviewer in the Gentleman 's Magazine grows more and more civil . Should he continue to sweeten at this rate , as he proceeds , I know not what will become of all the little modesty I have left . I have availed myself of some of his strictures , for I wish to learn from every body .</p>

     <l n="1">The Lodge , Dec. 21 , 1791 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— It grieves me , after having indulged a little hope that I might see you in the holidays , to be obliged to disappoint myself . The occasion too is such as will ensure me your sympathy .</p>
   <p>On Saturday last , while I was at my desk near the window , and Mrs. Unwin at the fireside opposite to it , I heard her suddenly exclaim , “ Oh ! Mr. Cowper , do n't let me fall ! ” I turned and saw her actually falling , together with her chair , and started to her side just in time to prevent her . She was seized with a violent giddiness , which lasted , though with some abatement , the whole day , and was attended too with some other very , very alarming symptoms . At present , however , she is relieved from the vertigo , and seems in all respects better .</p>
   <p>She has been my faithful and affectionate nurse for many years , and consequently has a claim on all my attentions . She has them , and will have them as long as she wants them ; which will probably be , at the best , a considerable time to come . I feel the shock , as you may suppose , in every nerve . God grant that there may be no repetition of it . Another such a stroke upon her would , I think , overset me completely ; but at present I hold up bravely .</p>
   <p>W. C .</p>
   <p>Few events could have afflicted the tender and affectionate mind of Cowper more acutely than the distressing incident recorded in the preceding letter . Mrs. Unwin had for some time past experienced frequent returns of headache , sensations of bodily pain , and an increasing incapacity even for the common routine of daily duties . By an intelligent observer these symptoms might have been interpreted as the precursors of some impending dispensation , in the same manner as the gathering clouds and the solemn stillness of nature announce the approaching storm and tempest . But the stroke is not the less felt because it is anticipated . Among the sorrows which inflict a wound on the feeling heart , to see a beloved object , identified in character , in sentiment , and pursuit , endeared to us by the memory of the past , and by the fears and anxieties of the present , sinking under the slow yet consuming incursions of disease ; and to be assured , as we contemplate the fading form , that the moment of separation is drawing nigh ; this is indeed a trial , where the mind feels its own bitterness , and is awakened to the strongest emotions of tenderness and love .</p>
   <p>The cheering prospect of a happy change , founded on an interest in the promises of the gospel , can alone mitigate the mournful anticipation . It is a subject for deep thankfulness when we can cherish the persuasion for ourselves , or , like Cowper , feel its consoling support for others ; and when we are enabled to exclaim with the poet ,</p>

   <p>My dear Madam ,— Silent as I have long been , I have had but too good a reason for being so . About six weeks since , Mrs. Unwin was seized with a sudden and most alarming disorder , a vertigo , which would have thrown her out of her chair to the ground , had I not been quick enough to catch her while she was falling . For some moments her knees and ancles were so entirely disabled that she had no use of them ; and it was with the exertion of all my strength that I replaced her in her seat . Many days she kept her bed , and for some weeks her chamber ; but , at length , she has joined me again in the study . Her recovery has been extremely slow , and she is still feeble ; but , I thank God , not so feeble but that I hope for her perfect restoration as the spring advances . I am persuaded , that with your feelings for your friends , you will know how to imagine what I must have suffered on an occasion so distressing , and to pardon a silence owing to such a cause .</p>
   <p>The account you give me of the patience with which a lady of your acquaintance has lately endured a terrible operation , is a strong proof that your sex surpasses ours in heroic fortitude . I call it by that name , because I verily believe , that in God 's account , there is more true heroism in suffering his will with meek submission than in doing our own , or that of our fellow mortals who may have a right to command us , with the utmost valour that was ever exhibited in a field of battle . Renown and glory are , in general , the incitements to such exertions ; but no laurels are to be won by sitting patiently under the knife of a surgeon . The virtue is , therefore , of a less suspicious character ; the principle of it more simple , and the practice more difficult ;— considerations that seem sufficiently to warrant my opinion , that the infallible Judge of human conduct may possibly behold with more complacency a suffering than an active courage .</p>
   <p>I forget if I told you that I am engaged for a new edition of Milton 's Poems . In fact , I have still other engagements , and so various , that I hardly know to which of them all to give my first attentions . I have only time , therefore , to condole with you on the double loss you have lately sustained , and to congratulate you on being female ; because , as such , you will , I trust , acquit yourself well under so severe a trial .</p>
   <p>I remain , my dear madam , Most sincerely yours , W. C .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— It is the only advantage I believe , that they who love each other derive from living at a distance , that the news of such ills as may happen to either seldom reaches the other till the cause of complaint is over . Had I been your next neighbour , I should have suffered with you during the whole indisposition of your two children and your own . As it is , I have nothing to do but to rejoice in your own recovery and theirs , which I do sincerely , and wish only to learn from yourself that it is complete .</p>
   <p>I thank you for suggesting the omission of the line due to the helmet of Achilles . How the omission happened I know not , whether by my fault or the printer 's ; it is certain , however , that I had translated it , and I have now given it its proper place .</p>
   <p>I purpose to keep back a second edition till I have had opportunity to avail myself of the remarks of both friends and strangers . The ordeal of criticism still awaits me in the reviews , and probably they will all in their turn mark many things that may be mended . By the Gentleman 's Magazine I have already profited in several instances . My reviewer there , though favourable in the main , is a pretty close observer , and , though not always right , is often so .</p>
   <p>In the affair of Milton I will have no horrida bella if I can help it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 623 ]</span>It is at least my present purpose to avoid them , if possible . For which reason , unless I should soon see occasion to alter my plan , I shall confine myself merely to the business of an annotator , which is my proper province , and shall sift out of Warton 's notes every tittle that relates to the private character , political or religious principles , of my author . These are properly subjects for a biographer 's handling , but by no means , as it seems to me , for a commentator 's .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 623 ]</span>He alludes to the dispute between Boydell and Fuseli the painter .</p>
   <p>In answer to your question , if I have had a correspondence with the Chancellor , I reply — yes . We exchanged three or four letters on the subject of Homer , or rather on the subject of my Preface . He was doubtful whether or not my preference of blank verse , as affording opportunity for a closer version , was well founded . On this subject he wished to be convinced ; defended rhyme with much learning , and much shrewd reasoning ; but at last allowed me the honour of the victory , expressing himself in these words :— “ I am clearly convinced that Homer may be best rendered in blank verse , and you have succeeded in the passages that I have looked into . ”</p>
   <p>Thus it is when a wise man differs in opinion . Such a man will be candid ; and conviction , not triumph , will be his object .</p>

   <p>Dear Sir ,— Yesterday evening your parcel came safe to hand , containing the “ Cursory Remarks , ” “ Fletcher 's Faithful Shepherdesse , ” and your kind letter , for all which I am much obliged to you .</p>
   <p>Everything that relates to Milton must be welcome to an editor of him ; and I am so unconnected with the learned world that , unless assistance seeks me , I am not very likely to find it . Fletcher 's work was not in my possession ; nor , indeed , was I possessed of any other , when I engaged in this undertaking , that could serve me much in the performance of it . The various untoward incidents of a very singular life have deprived me of a valuable collection , partly inherited from my father , partly from my brother ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 624 ]</span>and partly made by myself ; so that I have at present fewer books than any man ought to have who writes for the public , especially who assumes the character of an editor . At the present moment , however , I find myself tolerably well provided for this occasion by the kindness of a few friends , who have not been backward to pick from their shelves everything that they thought might be useful to me . I am happy to be able to number you among these friendly contributors .</p>

   <p>You will add a considerable obligation to those you have already conferred , if you will be so good as to furnish me with such notices of your own as you offer . Parallel passages , or , at least , a striking similarity of expression , is always worthy of remark ; and I shall reprint , I believe , all Mr. Warton 's notes of that kind , except such as are rather trivial , and some , perhaps , that are a little whimsical , and except that I shall diminish the number of his references , which are not seldom redundant . Where a word only is in question , and that , perhaps , not an uncommon one in the days of Milton , his use of it proves little or nothing ; for it is possible that authors writing on similar subjects may use the same words by mere accident . Borrowing seems to imply poverty , and of poverty I can rather suspect any man than Milton . But I have as yet determined nothing absolutely concerning the mode of my commentary , having hitherto been altogether busied in the translation of his Latin poems . These I have finished , and shall immediately proceed to a version of the Italian . They , being few , will not detain me long ; and , when they are done , will leave me at full liberty to deliberate on the main business , and to plan and methodise my operations .</p>
   <p>I shall be always happy in , and account myself honoured by , your communications , and hope that our correspondence thus begun will not terminate in limine primo .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— When I wrote the lines in question , I was , as I almost always am , so pressed for time , that I was obliged to put them down in a great hurry .<span type="note_anchor">[ 626 ]</span>Perhaps I printed them wrong .

   <p>Trifling enough I readily confess they are : but I have always allowed myself to trifle occasionally ; and on this occasion had not , nor have at present , time to do more . By the way , should you think this amended copy worthy to displace the former , I must wait for some future opportunity to send you them properly transcribed for the purpose .</p>
   <p>Your demand of more original composition from me will , if I live , and it please God to afford me health , in all probability be sooner or later gratified . In the mean time , you need not , and , if you turn the matter in your thoughts a little , you will perceive that you need not , think me unworthily employed in preparing a new edition of Milton . His two principal poems are of a kind that call for an editor who believes the gospel and is well grounded in all evangelical doctrine . Such an editor they have never had yet , though only such a one can be qualified for the office .</p>
   <p>We mourn for the mismanagement at Botany Bay , and foresee the issue . The Romans were , in their origin , banditti ; and if they became in time masters of the world , it was not by drinking grog , and allowing themselves in all sorts of licentiousness . The African colonization , and the manner of conducting it , has long been matter to us of pleasing speculation . God has highly honoured Mr. Thornton ; and I doubt not that the subsequent history of the two settlements will strikingly evince the superior wisdom of his proceedings .<span type="note_anchor">[ 628 ]</span></p>
   <p>Yours , W. C .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 628 ]</span>This alludes to the new colony for liberated Africans , at Sierra Leone ; in the origin of which Mr. Henry Thornton and Mr. Zachary Macauley were mainly instrumental . For interesting accounts of this colony , see the “ Missionary Register of the Church Missionary Society , ” passim .</p>
   <p>P. S . Lady Hesketh made the same objection to my verses as you ; but , she being a lady-critic , I did not heed her . As they stand at present , however , they are hers ; and I believe you will think them much improved .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— My obligations to you on the score of your kind and friendly remarks demanded from me a much more expeditious acknowledgment of the numerous packets that contained them ; but I have been hindered by many causes , each of which you would admit as a sufficient apology , but none of which I will mention , lest I should give too much of my paper to the subject . My acknowledgments are likewise due to your fair sister , who has transcribed so many sheets in a neat hand , and with so much accuracy .</p>
   <p>At present I have no leisure for Homer , but shall certainly find leisure to examine him with reference to your strictures , before I send him a second time to the printer . This I am at present unwilling to do , choosing rather to wait , if that may be , till I shall have undergone the discipline of all the reviewers ; none of which have yet taken me in hand , the Gentleman 's Magazine excepted . By several of his remarks I have benefited , and shall no doubt be benefited by the remarks of all .</p>
   <p>Milton at present engrosses me altogether . His Latin pieces I have translated , and have begun with the Italian . These are few , and will not detain me long . I shall then proceed immediately to deliberate upon and to settle the plan of my commentary , which I have hitherto had but little time to consider . I look forward to it , for this reason , with some anxiety . I trust at least that this anxiety will cease when I have once satisfied myself about the best manner of conducting it . But , after all , I seem to fear more about the labour to which it calls me than any great difficulty with which it is likely to be attended . To the labours of versifying I have no objection , but to the labours of criticism I am new , and apprehend that I shall find them wearisome . Should that be the case , I shall be dull , and must be contented to share the censure of being so with almost all the commentators that have ever existed .</p>
   <p>I have expected , but not wondered that I have not received , Sir Thomas More and the other MSS . you promised me ; because my silence has been such , considering how loudly I was called upon to write , that you must have concluded me either dead or dying , and did not choose perhaps to trust them to executors .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— I have this moment finished a comparison of your remarks with my text , and feel so sensibly my obligations to your great accuracy and kindness , that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of expressing them immediately . I only wish that instead of revising the two first books of the Iliad , you could have found leisure to revise the whole two poems , sensible how much my work would have benefited .</p>
   <p>I have not always adopted your lines , though often , perhaps , at least as good as my own ; because there will and must be dissimilarity of manner between two so accustomed to the pen as we are . But I have let few passages go unamended which you seemed to think exceptionable ; and this not at all from complaisance : for in such a cause I would not sacrifice an iota on that principle , but on clear conviction .</p>
   <p>I have as yet heard nothing from Johnson about the two MSS . you announce , but feel ashamed that I should want your letter to remind me of your obliging offer to inscribe Sir Thomas More to me , should you resolve to publish him . Of my consent to such a measure you need not doubt . I am covetous of respect and honour from all such as you .</p>
   <p>Tame hare , at present , I have none . But , to make amends , I have a beautiful little spaniel , called Beau , to whom I will give the kiss your sister Sally intended for the former , unless she should command me to bestow it elsewhere ; it shall attend on her directions .</p>
   <p>I am going to take a last dinner with a most agreeable family , who have been my only neighbours ever since I have lived at Weston . On Monday they go to London , and in the summer to an estate in Oxfordshire , which is to be their home in future . The occasion is not at all a pleasant one to me , nor does it leave me spirits to add more , than that I am , dear sir ,</p>
   <p>Most truly yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— All our little world is going to London , the gulf that swallows most of our good things , and , like a bad stomach , too often assimilates them to itself . Our neighbours at the Hall go thither to-morrow . Mr. and Mrs. Throckmorton , as we lately called them , but now Sir John and my Lady , are no longer inhabitants here , but henceforth of Bucklands , in Berkshire . I feel the loss of them , and shall feel it , since kinder or more friendly treatment I never can receive at any hands than I have always found at theirs . But it has long been a foreseen change , and was , indeed , almost daily expected long before it happened . The desertion of the Hall , however , will not be total . The second brother , George , now Mr. Courtenay ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 630 ]</span>intends to reside there ; and , with him , as with his elder brother , I have always been on terms the most agreeable .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 630 ]</span>Afterwards Sir George Throckmorton .</p>
   <p>Such is this variable scene : so variable that , had the reflections I sometimes make upon it a permanent influence , I should tremble at the thought of a new connexion , and , to be out of the reach of its mutability , lead almost the life of a hermit . It is well with those who , like you , have God for their companion . Death cannot deprive them of Him , and he changes not the place of his abode . Other changes , therefore , to them are all supportable ; and what you say of your own experience is the strongest possible proof of it . Had you lived without God , you could not have endured the loss you mention . May He preserve me from a similar one ; at least , till he shall be pleased to draw me to himself again ! Then , if ever that day come , it will make me equal to any burden ; but at present I can bear nothing well .</p>
   <p>I am sincerely yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Madam ,— Having just finished all my Miltonic translations , and not yet begun my comments , I find an interval that cannot be better employed than in discharging arrears due to my correspondents , of whom I begin first a letter to you , though your claim be of less ancient standing than those of all the rest .</p>
   <p>I am extremely sorry that you have been so much indisposed , and especially that your indisposition has been attended with such excessive pain . But may I be permitted to observe , that your going to church on Christmas-day , immediately after such a sharp fit of rheumatism , was not according to the wisdom with which I believe you to be endued , nor was it acting so charitably toward yourself as I am persuaded you would have acted toward another . To another you would , I doubt not , have suggested that text — “ I will have mercy and not sacrifice , ” as implying a gracious dispensation , in circumstances like yours , from the practice of so severe and dangerous a service .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin , I thank God , is better , but still wants much of complete restoration . We have reached a time of life when heavy blows , if not fatal , are at least long felt .</p>
   <p>I have received many testimonies concerning my Homer , which do me much honour , and afford me great satisfaction ; but none from which I derive , or have reason to derive , more than that of Mr. Martyn . It is of great use to me , when I write , to suppose some such person at my elbow , witnessing what I do ; and I ask myself frequently — Would this please him ? If I think it would , it stands : if otherwise , I alter it . My work is thus finished , as it were , under the eye of some of the best judges , and has the better chance to win their approbation when they actually see it .</p>
   <p>I am , my dear madam , Affectionately yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>Dear Sir ,— You will have more candour , as I hope and believe , than to impute my delay to answer your kind and friendly letter to inattention or want of a cordial respect for the writer of it . To suppose any such cause of my silence were injustice both to yourself and me . The truth is , I am a very busy man , and cannot gratify myself with writing to my friends so punctually as I wish .</p>
   <p>You have not in the least fallen in my esteem on account of your employment ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 632 ]</span>as you seemed to apprehend that you might . It is an elegant one , and , when you speak modestly , as you do , of your proficiency in it , I am far from giving you entire credit for the whole assertion . I had indeed supposed you a person of independent fortune , who had nothing to do but to gratify himself ; and whose mind , being happily addicted to literature , was at full leisure to enjoy its innocent amusement . But it seems I was mistaken , and your time is principally due to an art which has a right pretty much to engross your attention , and which gives rather the air of an intrigue to your intercourse and familiarity with the muses than a lawful connexion . No matter : I am not prudish in this respect , but honour you the more for a passion , virtuous and laudable in itself ; and which you indulge not , I dare say , without benefit to yourself and your acquaintance . I , for one , am likely to reap the fruit of your amours , and ought , therefore , to be one of the last to quarrel with them .</p>

   <p>You are in danger , I perceive , of thinking of me more highly than you ought to think . I am not one of the literati , among whom you seem disposed to place me . Far from it . I told you in my last how heinously I am unprovided with the means of being so , having long since sent all my books to market . My learning accordingly lies in a very narrow compass . It is school-boy learning somewhat improved , and very little more . From the age of twenty to twenty-three , I was occupied , or ought to have been , in the study of the law . From thirty-three to sixty I have spent my time in the country , where my reading has been only an apology for idleness , and where , when I had not either a magazine or a review in my hand , I was sometimes a carpenter , at others a bird-cage maker , or a gardener , or a drawer of landscapes . At fifty years of age I commenced an author . It is a whim that has served me longest and best , and which will probably be my last .</p>
   <p>Thus you see I have had very little opportunity to become what is properly called — learned . In truth , having given myself so entirely of late to poetry , I am not sorry for this deficiency , since great learning , I have been sometimes inclined to suspect , is rather a hindrance to the fancy than a furtherance .</p>
   <p>You will do me a favour by sending me a copy of Thomson 's monumental inscription . He was a poet , for whose memory , as you justly suppose , I have great respect ; in common , indeed , with all who have ever read him with taste and attention .</p>
   <p>Wishing you heartily success in your present literary undertaking and in all professional ones , I remain ,</p>
   <p>Dear sir , with great esteem , Sincerely yours , W. C .</p>
   <p>P. S. After what I have said , I will not blush to confess , that I am at present perfectly unacquainted with the merits of Drummond ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 633 ]</span>but shall be happy to see him in due time , as I should be to see any author edited by you .</p>

   <p>My dear Johnny ,— You talk of primroses that you pulled on Candlemas-day ; but what think you of me that heard a nightingale on new-year 's day ? Perhaps I am the only man in England who can boast of such good fortune ; good indeed , for if it was at all an omen it could not be an unfavourable one . The winter , however , is now making himself amends , and seems the more peevish for having been encroached on at so undue a season . Nothing less than a large slice out of the spring will satisfy him .</p>
   <p>Lady Hesketh left us yesterday . She intended to have left us four days sooner ; but in the evening before the day fixed for her departure , snow enough fell to occasion just so much delay of it .</p>
   <p>We have faint hopes that in the month of May we shall see her again . I know that you have had a letter from her , and you will no doubt have the grace not to make her wait long for an answer .</p>
   <p>We expect Mr. Rose on Tuesday ; but he stays with us only till the Saturday following . With him I shall have some conferences on the subject of Homer , respecting a new edition I mean , and some perhaps on the subject of Milton ; on him I have not yet begun to comment , or even fix the time when I shall .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— We are now once more reduced to our dual state , having lost our neighbours at the Hall and our inmate Lady Hesketh . Mr. Rose , indeed , has spent two or three days here , and is still with us , but he leaves us in the afternoon . There are those in the world whom we love , and whom we are happy to see ; but we are happy likewise in each other , and so far independent of our fellow mortals as to be able to pass our time comfortably without them :— as comfortably , at least , as Mrs. Unwin 's frequent indispositions , and my no less frequent troubles of mind , will permit . When I am much distressed , any company but hers distresses me more , and makes me doubly sensible of my sufferings , though sometimes , I confess , it falls out otherwise ; and , by the help of more general conversation , I recover that elasticity of mind which is able to resist the pressure . On the whole , I believe I am situated exactly as I should wish to be , were my situation to be determined by my own election ; and am denied no comfort that is compatible with the total absence of the chief of all .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear friend .</p>
   <p>I remain , affectionately yours , W. C .</p>

     <l n="1">Weston , March 23 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— I have read your play carefully , and with great pleasure ; it seems now to be a performance that cannot fail to do you much credit . Yet , unless my memory deceives me , the scene between Cecilia and Heron in the garden has lost something that pleased me much when I saw it first ; and I am not sure that you have not likewise obliterated an account of Sir Thomas 's execution , that I found very pathetic . It would be strange if , in these two particulars , I should seem to miss what never existed ; you will presently know whether I am as good at remembering what I never saw as I am at forgetting what I have seen . But , if I am right , I cannot help recommending the omitted passages to your re-consideration . If the play were designed for representation , I should be apt to think Cecilia 's first speech rather too long , and should prefer to have it broken into dialogue , by an interposition now and then from one of her sisters . But , since it is designed , as I understand , for the closet only , that objection seems of no importance ; at no rate , however , would I expunge it , because it is both prettily imagined and elegantly written .</p>
   <p>I have read your cursory remarks , and am much pleased , both with the style and the argument . Whether the latter be new or not I am not competent to judge ; if it be , you are entitled to much praise for the invention of it . Where other data are wanting to ascertain the time when an author of many pieces wrote each in particular , there can be no better criterion by which to determine the point than the more or less proficiency manifested in the composition . Of this proficiency , where it appears , and of those plays in which it appears not , you seem to have judged well and truly , and , consequently , I approve of your arrangement .</p>
   <p>I attended , as you desired me , in reading the character of Cecilia , to the hint you gave me concerning your sister Sally , and give you joy of such a sister . This , however , not exclusively of the rest , for , though they may not all be Cecilias , I have a strong persuasion that they are all very amiable .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Coz ,— Mr. Rose 's longer stay than he at first intended was the occasion of the longer delay of my answer to your note , as you may both have perceived by the date thereof , and learned from his information . It was a daily trouble to me to see it lying in the window-seat , while I knew you were in expectation of its arrival . By this time I presume you have seen him , and have seen likewise Mr. Hayley 's friendly letter and complimentary sonnet , as well as the letter of the honest Quaker ; all of which , at least the two former , I shall be glad to receive again at a fair opportunity . Mr. Hayley 's letter slept six weeks in Johnson 's custody .<span type="note_anchor">[ 635 ]</span>It was necessary I should answer it without delay , and accordingly I answered it the very evening on which I received it , giving him to understand , among other things , how much vexation the bookseller 's folly had cost me , who had detained it so long : especially on account of the distress that I knew it must have occasioned to him also . From his reply , which the return of the post brought me , I learn that in the long interval of my non-correspondence , he had suffered anxiety and mortification enough ; so much , that I dare say he made twenty vows never to hazard again either letter or compliment to an unknown author . What , indeed , could he imagine less than that I meant by such an obstinate silence to tell him that I valued neither him nor his praises , nor his proffered friendship ; in short that I considered him as a rival , and therefore , like a true author , hated and despised him ? He is now , however , convinced that I love him , as indeed I do , and I account him the chief acquisition that my own verse has ever procured me . Brute should I be if I did not , for he promises me every assistance in his power .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 635 ]</span>We have already stated that Hayley was engaged in a life of Milton , when Cowper was announced as editor of Johnson 's projected work . With a generosity that reflects the highest credit on his feelings , he addressed a letter on this occasion to Cowper , accompanied by a complimentary sonnet , and offering his kind aid in anyway that might prove most acceptable . The letter was entrusted to the bookseller , who delayed transmitting it six weeks , and thereby created great anxiety in Hayley 's mind .</p>
   <p>I have likewise a very pleasing letter from Mr. Park , which I wish you were here to read ; and a very pleasing poem that came enclosed in it for my revisal , written when he was only twenty years of age , yet wonderfully well written , though wanting some correction .</p>
   <p>To Mr. Hurdis I return Sir Thomas More to-morrow , having revised it a second time . He is now a very respectable figure , and will do my friend , who gives him to the public this spring , considerable credit .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— If you have indeed so favourable an opinion of my judgment as you profess , which I shall not allow myself to question , you will think highly and honourably of your poem ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 636 ]</span>for so I think of it . The view you give of the place that you describe is clear and distinct , the sentiments are just , the reflections touching , and the numbers uncommonly harmonious . I give you joy of having been able to produce , at twenty years of age , what would not have disgraced you at a much later period ; and , if you choose to print it , have no doubt that it will do you great credit .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 636 ]</span>A juvenile offering of gratitude to the place where the writer had received his education .</p>
   <p>You will perceive , however , when you receive your copy again , that I have used all the liberty you gave me . I have proposed many alterations ; but you will consider them as only proposed . My lines are by no means obtruded on you , but are ready to give place to any that you shall choose to substitute of your own composing . They will serve at least to mark the passages which seem to me susceptible of improvement , and the manner in which I think the change may be made . I have not always , seldom indeed , given my reasons ; but without a reason I have altered nothing , and the decision , as I say , is left with you in the last instance . Time failed me to be particular and explicit always , in accounting for my strictures , and I assured myself that you would impute none of them to an arbitrary humour , but all to their true cause — a desire to discharge faithfully the trust committed to me .</p>
   <p>I cannot but add , I think it a pity that you , who have evidently such talents for poetry , should be so loudly called another way , and want leisure to cultivate them ; for if such was the bud , what might we not have expected to see in the full-blown flower ? Perhaps , however , I am not quite prudent in saying all this to you , whose proper function is not that of a poet , but I say it , trusting to your prudence , that you will not suffer it to seduce you .</p>
   <p>I have not the edition of Milton 's juvenile poems which you mention , but shall be truly glad to see it , and thank you for the offer .</p>
   <p>No possible way occurs to me of returning your MS. but by the Wellingborough coach ; by that conveyance , therefore , I shall send it on Monday , and my remarks , rough as I made them , shall accompany it .</p>
   <p>Believe me , with much sincerity ,</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— My mornings , ever since you went , have been given to my correspondents ; this morning I have already written a long letter to Mr. Park , giving my opinion of his poem , which is a favourable one . I forget whether I showed it to you when you were here , and even whether I had then received it . He has genius and delicate taste ; and , if he were not an engraver , might be one of our first hands in poetry .</p>

   <p>You talk , my dear friend , as John Bunyan says , “ like one that has the egg-shell still upon his head . ” You talk of the mighty favours that you have received from me , and forget entirely those for which I am indebted to you ; but though you forget them , I shall not , nor ever think that I have requited you so long as any opportunity presents itself of rendering you the smallest service : small indeed is all that I can ever hope to render .</p>
   <p>You now perceive , and sensibly , that not without reason I complained , as I use to do , of those tiresome rogues , the printers . Bless yourself that you have not two thick quartos to bring forth , as I had . My vexation was always much increased by this reflection — they are every day , and all day long , employed in printing for somebody , and why not for me ? This was adding mortification to disappointment , so that I often lost all patience .</p>
   <p>The suffrage of Dr. Robertson makes more than amends for the scurvy jest passed upon me by the wag unknown . I regard him not ; nor , except for about two moments after I first heard of his doings , have I ever regarded him . I have somewhere a secret enemy ; I know not for what cause he should be so , but he , I imagine , supposes that he has a cause : it is well , however , to have but one ; and I will take all the care I can not to increase the number .</p>
   <p>I have begun my notes , and am playing the commentator manfully . The worst of it is that I am anticipated in almost all my opportunities to shine by those who have gone before me .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— God grant that this friendship of ours may be a comfort to us all the rest of our days , in a world where true friendships are rarities , and , especially where suddenly formed , they are apt soon to terminate ! But , as I said before , I feel a disposition of heart toward you that I never felt for one whom I had never seen ; and that shall prove itself , I trust , in the event , a propitious omen .</p>

   <p>It gives me the sincerest pleasure that I may hope to see you at Weston ; for , as to any migrations of mine , they must , I fear , notwithstanding the joy I should feel in being a guest of yours , be still considered in the light of impossibilities . Come , then , my friend , and be as welcome ( as the country people say here ) as the flowers in May ! I am happy , as I say , in expectation ; but the fear , or rather the consciousness , that I shall not answer on a nearer view , makes it a trembling kind of happiness and a doubtful .</p>
   <p>After the privacy , which I have mentioned above , I went to Huntingdon ; soon after my arrival there , I took up my quarters at the house of the Rev . Mr. Unwin ; I lived with him while he lived , and ever since his death have lived with his widow . Her , therefore , you will find mistress of the house ; and I judge of you amiss , or you will find her just such as you would wish . To me she has been often a nurse , and invariably the kindest friend , through a thousand adversities that I have had to grapple with in the course of almost thirty years . I thought it better to introduce her to you thus , than to present her to you at your coming , quite a stranger .</p>
   <p>Bring with you any books that you think may be useful to my commentatorship , for , with you for an interpreter , I shall be afraid of none of them . And , in truth , if you think that you shall want them , you must bring books for your own use also , for they are an article with which I am heinously unprovided : being much in the condition of the man whose library Pope describes as</p>
   <p>“ No mighty store ! His own works neatly bound , and little more ! ”</p>
   <p>You shall know how this has come to pass hereafter .</p>
   <p>Tell me , my friend , are your letters in your own hand-writing ? If so , I am in pain for your eyes , lest by such frequent demands upon them I should hurt them . I had rather write you three letters for one , much as I prize your letters , than that should happen . And now , for the present , adieu — I am going to accompany Milton into the lake of fire and brimstone , having just begun my annotations .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— Your entertaining and pleasant letter , resembling in that respect all that I receive from you , deserved a more expeditious answer , and should have had what it so well deserved , had it not reached me at a time when , deeply in debt to all my correspondents , I had letters to write without number . Like autumnal leaves that strew the brooks in Vallombrosa , the unanswered farrago lay before me . If I quote at all , you must expect me henceforth to quote none but Milton , since for a long time to come I shall be occupied with him only .</p>
   <p>I was much pleased with the extract you gave me from your sister Eliza 's letter ; she writes very elegantly , and ( if I might say it without seeming to flatter you ) I should say much in the manner of her brother . It is well for your sister Sally that gloomy Dis is already a married man , else perhaps finding her , as he found Proserpine , studying botany in the fields , he might transport her to his own flowerless abode , where all her hopes of improvement in that science would be at an end for ever .</p>
   <p>What letter of the 10th of December is that which you say you have not yet answered ? Consider , it is April now , and I never remember any thing that I write half so long . But perhaps it relates to Calchas , for I do remember that you have not yet furnished me with the secret history of him and his family , which I demanded from you .</p>

   <p>For this we may thank Adam ;— and you may thank him , too , that I am not able to fill my sheet , nor endure a writing posture any longer . I conclude abruptly , therefore , but sincerely subscribing myself , with my best compliments to Mrs. Hill ,</p>
   <p>Your affectionate , W. C .</p>

    <head>TO LADY THROCKMORTON .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , April 16 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Lady Frog ,— I thank you for your letter , as sweet as it was short , and as sweet as good news could make it . You encourage a hope that has made me happy ever since I have entertained it . And if my wishes can hasten the event , it will not be long suspended .<span type="note_anchor">[ 641 ]</span>As to your jealousy , I mind it not , or only to be pleased with it ; I shall say no more on the subject at present than this , that of all ladies living , a certain lady , whom I need not name , would be the lady of my choice for a certain gentleman , were the whole sex submitted to my election .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 641 ]</span>The prospect of a marriage between Miss Stapleton , the Catharina of Cowper , and Mr. Courtenay , Sir John Throckmorton 's brother .</p>
   <p>What a delightful anecdote is that which you tell me of a young lady detected in the very act of stealing our Catharina 's praises ; is it possible that she can survive the shame , the mortification , of such a discovery ? Can she ever see the same company again , or any company that she can suppose , by the remotest possibility , may have heard the tidings ? If she can , she must have an assurance equal to her vanity . A lady in London stole my song on the broken Rose , or rather would have stolen and have passed it for her own . But she too was unfortunate in her attempt ; for there happened to be a female cousin of mine in company , who knew that I had written it . It is very flattering to a poet 's pride that the ladies should thus hazard everything for the sake of appropriating his verses . I may say with Milton , that I am fallen on evil tongues , and evil days , being not only plundered of that which belongs to me , but being charged with that which does not . Thus it seems ( and I have learned it from more quarters than one ) that a report is , and has been some time , current in this and the neighbouring counties , that , though I have given myself the air of declaiming against the Slave Trade in “ The Task , ” I am in reality a friend to it ; and last night I received a letter from Joe Rye , to inform me that I have been much traduced and calumniated on this account . Not knowing how I could better or more effectually refute the scandal , I have this morning sent a copy to the Northampton paper , prefaced by a short letter to the printer , specifying the occasion . The verses are in honour of Mr. Wilberforce , and sufficiently expressive of my present sentiments on the subject . You are a wicked fair one for disappointing us of our expected visit , and therefore , out of mere spite , I will not insert them . I have been very ill these ten days , and for the same spite 's sake will not tell you what has ailed me . But , lest you should die of a fright , I will have the mercy to tell you that I am recovering .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Gifford and her little ones are gone , but your brother is still here . He told me that he had some expectations of Sir John at Weston ; if he come , I shall most heartily rejoice once more to see him at a table so many years his own .</p>

   <p>In detailing the incidents that occur in the life of Cowper , we have just recorded a malevolent report , highly injurious to his integrity and honour . In order to recall the fact to the memory of the reader , we insert the statement itself , in the words of Cowper : “ A report is , and has been some time current , in this and the neighbouring counties , that , though I have given myself the air of declaiming against the slave trade , in ‘ The Task , ’ I am in reality a friend to it ; and last night I received a letter from Joe Rye , to inform me , that I have been much traduced and calumniated on this account . ”</p>
   <p>That the author of “ The Task , ” a poem distinguished by its tone of pure and elevated morality , and breathing a spirit of most uncompromising hostility against the slave trade — that such a man , at that time in the very zenith of his fame , should be publicly accused of favouring the very cause which he had so eloquently denounced , is one of those circumstances which , for the honour of human nature , we could wish not to have been compelled to record .</p>
   <p>With this painful fact before us , we would ask , what is popularity , and what wise man would attach value to so fleeting a possession ? It is a gleam of sunshine , which embellishes for a moment the object on which it falls , and then vanishes away . In the course of a life not passed without observation , we have had occasion to remark , in the political , the literary , and even in the religious world , the evanescent character of popular favour . We have seen men alternately caressed and deserted , praised and censured , and made to feel the vanity of human applause and admiration . The idol of to-day is dethroned by the idol of to-morrow , which in its turn yields to the dominion of some more favoured rival .</p>
   <p>The wisdom of God evidently designs , by these events , to check the thirst for human praise and distinction , by showing us the precarious tenure by which they are held . We are thus admonished to examine our motives , and to be assured of the integrity of our intentions ; neither to despise public favour , nor yet to overvalue it ; but to preserve that calm and equable temper of mind , and that full consciousness of the rectitude of our principles , that we may learn to enjoy it without triumph , or to lose it without dejection .</p>

   <p>The reader will be amused in finding the origin of the injurious report above mentioned disclosed in the following letter . Mr. Rye was unjustly supposed to have aided in propagating this misconception ; but Cowper fully vindicates him from such a charge .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— I am truly sorry that you should have suffered any apprehensions , such as your letter indicates , to molest you for a moment . I believe you to be as honest a man as lives , and consequently do not believe it possible that you could in your letter to Mr. Pitts , or any otherwise , wilfully misrepresent me . In fact you did not ; my opinions on the subject in question were , when I had the pleasure of seeing you , such as in that letter you stated them to be , and such they still continue .</p>
   <p>If any man concludes , because I allow myself the use of sugar and rum , that therefore I am a friend to the slave trade , he concludes rashly , and does me great wrong ; for the man lives not who abhors it more than I do . My reasons for my own practice are satisfactory to myself , and they whose practice is contrary , are , I suppose , satisfied with theirs . So far is good . Let every man act according to his own judgment and conscience ; but if we condemn another for not seeing with our eyes , we are unreasonable ; and if we reproach him on that account , we are uncharitable , which is a still greater evil .</p>
   <p>I had heard , before I received the favour of yours , that such a report of me as you mention had spread about the country . But my information told me that it was founded thus — The people of Olney petitioned parliament for the abolition — My name was sought among the subscribers , but was not found . A question was asked , how that happened ? Answer was made , that I had once indeed been an enemy to the slave trade , but had changed my mind , for that , having lately read a history , or an account of Africa , I had seen it there asserted , that till the commencement of that traffic , the negroes , multiplying at a prodigious rate , were necessitated to devour each other ; for which reason I had judged it better that the trade should continue , than that they should be again reduced to so horrid a custom .</p>
   <p>Now all this is a fable . I have read no such history ; I never in my life read any such assertion ; nor , had such an assertion presented itself to me , should I have drawn any such conclusion from it . On the contrary , bad as it were , I think it would be better the negroes should even eat one another , than that we should carry them to market . The single reason why I did not sign the petition was , because I was never asked to do it ; and the reason why I was never asked was , because I am not a parishioner of Olney .</p>
   <p>Thus stands the matter . You will do me the justice , I dare say , to speak of me as of a man who abhors the commerce , which is now , I hope , in a fair way to be abolished , as often as you shall find occasion . And I beg you henceforth to do yourself the justice to believe it impossible that I should , for a moment , suspect you of duplicity or misrepresentation . I have been grossly slandered , but neither by you , nor in consequence of any thing that you have either said or written . I remain therefore , still , as heretofore , with great respect , much and truly yours ,</p>

   <p>Cowper , on this occasion , addressed the following letter to the editors of the Northampton Mercury , enclosing the verses on Mr. Wilberforce which have just been inserted .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO THE PRINTERS OF THE NORTHAMPTON MERCURY .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston-Underwood , April 16 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sirs ,— Having lately learned that it is pretty generally reported , both in your county and in this , that my present opinion , concerning the slave trade , differs totally from that which I have heretofore given to the public , and that I am no longer an enemy but a friend to that horrid traffic ; I entreat you to take an early opportunity to insert in your paper the following lines ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 643 ]</span>written no longer since than this very morning , expressly for the two purposes of doing just honour to the gentleman with whose name they are inscribed , and of vindicating myself from an aspersion so injurious .</p>

   <p>Cowper 's version of Homer , which has formed so frequent a subject in the preceding pages , led to a public discussion , in which the interests of literature and the success of his own undertaking were deeply concerned . The question agitated was the relative merits of rhyme and blank verse , in undertaking a translation of that great poet . Johnson , the great dictator in the republic of letters , in his predilection for rhyme , had almost proscribed the use of blank verse in poetical composition . “ Poetry , ” he observes , in his life of Milton , “ may subsist without rhyme ; but English poetry will not please , nor can rhyme ever be safely spared , but where the subject is able to support itself . Blank verse makes some approach to that which is called the lapidary style ; has neither the easiness of prose , nor the melody of numbers ; and therefore tires by long continuance . Of the Italian writers without rhyme , whom Milton alleges as precedents , not one is popular . What reason could urge in its defence , has been confuted by the ear . ”</p>
   <p>Johnson , however , makes an exception , in the instance of Milton .</p>
   <p>“ But , whatever be the advantages of rhyme , ” he adds , “ I cannot prevail on myself to wish that Milton had been a rhymer ; for I cannot wish his work to be other than it is ; yet , like other heroes , he is to be admired rather than imitated . He that thinks himself capable of astonishing , may write blank verse ; but those that hope only to please must condescend to rhyme . ”</p>
   <p>In his critique on the “ Night Thoughts , ” he makes a similar concession . “ This is one of the few poems in which blank verse could not be changed for rhyme but with disadvantage . The wild diffusion of the sentiments , and the digressive sallies of imagination , would have been compressed and constrained by confinement to rhyme . "[ 644 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 644 ]</span>Young 's testimony in favour of blank verse is thus forcibly , though rather pompously expressed :—</p>
   <p>“ Blank verse is verse unfallen , uncursed ; verse reclaimed , re-enthroned in the true language of the gods . ”</p>
   <p>See Conjectures on Original Composition .</p>
   <p>Cowper , it will be remembered , questions the correctness of Johnson 's taste on this subject , and vindicates the force and majesty of blank verse with much weight of argument . With respect , however , to the important question , how a translation of Homer might be best executed , his sentiments are delivered so much at large in the admirable preface to his version of the Iliad , that we shall lay a few extracts from it before the reader .</p>
   <p>“ Whether a translation of Homer , ” he remarks , “ may be best executed in blank verse or in rhyme , is a question in the decision of which no man can find difficulty , who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be , or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very different kinds of versification . I will venture to assert , that a just translation of any ancient poet in rhyme is impossible . No human ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with sounds homotonous , expressing at the same time the full sense , and only the full sense , of his original . The translator 's ingenuity , indeed , in this case becomes itself a snare ; and the readier he is at invention and expedient , the more likely he is to be betrayed into the widest departures from the guide whom he professes to follow . ”</p>
   <p>It was this acknowledged defect in Pope , that led Cowper to engage in his laborious undertaking of producing a new version .</p>
   <p>We admire the candour with which he appreciates the merits of Pope 's translation , and yet we cannot refuse to admit the justness of his strictures .</p>
   <p>“ I have no contest , ” he observes , “ with my predecessor . None is supposable between performers on different instruments . Mr. Pope has surmounted all difficulties in his version of Homer that it was possible to surmount in rhyme . But he was fettered , and his fetters were his choice . ” “ He has given us the Tale of Troy divine in smooth verse , generally in correct and elegant language , and in diction often highly poetical . But his deviations are so many , occasioned chiefly by the cause already mentioned , that , much as he has done , and valuable as his work is on some accounts , it was yet in the humble province of a translator , that I thought it possible even for me to follow him with some advantage . ”</p>
   <p>What the reader may expect to discover in the two respective versions is thus described :— “ The matter found in me , whether he like it or not , is found also in Homer ; and the matter not found in me , how much soever he may admire it , is only found in Mr. Pope . I have omitted nothing ; I have invented nothing . ” “ Fidelity is indeed the very essence of translation , and the term itself implies it . For which reason , if we suppress the sense of our original , and force into its place our own , we may call our work an imitation , if we please , or perhaps a paraphrase , but it is no longer the same author only in a different dress , and therefore it is not a translation . ”</p>
   <p>After dwelling upon the merits and defects of the free and the close translation , and observing that the former can hardly be true to the original author 's style and manner , and that the latter is apt to be servile , he thus declares his view of the subject :— “ On the whole , the translation which partakes equally of fidelity and liberality , that is close , but not so close as to be servile ; free , but not so free as to be licentious , promises fairest ; and my ambition will be sufficiently gratified , if such of my readers as are able and will take the pains to compare me in this respect with Homer , shall judge that I have in any measure attained a point so difficult . ”</p>
   <p>He concludes his excellent preface with these interesting words :—</p>
   <p>“ And now I have only to regret that my pleasant work is ended . To the illustrious Greek I owe the smooth and easy flight of many thousand hours . He has been my companion at home and abroad , in the study , in the garden , and in the field ; and no measure of success , let my labours succeed as they may , will ever compensate to me the loss of the innocent luxury that I have enjoyed as a translator of Homer . ”</p>
   <p>Having thus endeavoured to do justice to the excellent preface of Cowper , we have reserved an interesting correspondence , which passed between Lord Thurlow and Cowper on this subject , and now introduce it to the notice of the reader . It is without date .</p>
   <p>TO THE LORD THURLOW .</p>
   <p>My Lord ,— A letter reached me yesterday from Henry Cowper , enclosing another from your lordship to himself ; of which a passage in my work formed the subject . It gave me the greatest pleasure : your strictures are perfectly just , and here follows the speech of Achilles accommodated to them ....</p>
   <p>I did not expect to find your lordship on the side of rhyme , remembering well with how much energy and interest I have heard you repeat passages from the “ Paradise Lost , ” which you could not have recited as you did , unless you had been perfectly sensible of their music . It comforts me , therefore , to know that if you have an ear for rhyme , you have an ear for blank verse also .</p>
   <p>It seems to me that I may justly complain of rhyme as an inconvenience in translation , even though I assert in the sequel that to me it has been easier to rhyme than to write without , because I always suppose a rhyming translator to ramble , and always obliged to do so . Yet I allow your lordship 's version of this speech of Achilles to be very close , and closer much than mine . But I believe that , should either your lordship or I give them burnish or elevation , your lines would be found , in measure as they acquired stateliness , to have lost the merit of fidelity — in which case nothing more would be done than Pope has done already .</p>
   <p>I cannot ask your lordship to proceed in your strictures , though I should be happy to receive more of them . Perhaps it is possible that when you retire into the country , you may now and then amuse yourself with my translation . Should your remarks reach me , I promise faithfully that they shall be all most welcome , not only as yours , but because I am sure my work will be the better for them .</p>
   <p>With sincere and fervent wishes for your lordship 's health and happiness , I remain , my lord , &amp; c .,</p>

     <l n="1">The following is Lord Thurlow 's reply :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>TO WILLIAM COWPER , ESQ .</p>
   <p>Dear Cowper ,— On coming to town this morning , I was surprised particularly at receiving from you an answer to a scrawl I sent Harry , which I have forgot too much to resume now . But I think I could not mean to patronize rhyme . I have fancied that it was introduced to mark the measure in modern languages , because they are less numerous and metrical than the ancient , and the name seems to import as much . Perhaps there was melody in ancient song without straining it to musical notes , as the common Greek pronunciation is said to have had the compass of five parts of an octave . But surely that word is only figuratively applied to modern poetry . Euphony seems to be the highest term it will bear . I have fancied also , that euphony is an impression derived a good deal from habit , rather than suggested by nature ; therefore in some degree accidental , and consequently conventional . Else , why can n't we bear a drama with rhyme , or the French , one without it ? Suppose the “ Rape of the Lock , ” “ Windsor Forest , ” “ L'Allegro , ” “ Il Penseroso , ” and many other little poems which please , stripped of the rhyme , which might easily be done , would they please us as well ? It would be unfair to treat rondeaus , ballads , and odes in the same manner , because rhyme makes in some sort a part of the conceit . It was this way of thinking which made me suppose that habitual prejudice would miss the rhyme ; and that neither Dryden nor Pope would have dared to give their great authors in blank verse .</p>
   <p>I wondered to hear you say you thought rhyme easier in original compositions ; but you explained it , that you could go further a-field if you were pushed for want of a rhyme . An expression preferred for the sake of the rhyme looks as if it were worth more than you allow . But , to be sure , in translation , the necessity of rhyme imposes very heavy fetters upon those who mean translation , not paraphrase . Our common heroic metre is enough ; the pure iambic bearing only a sparing introduction of spondees , trochees , &amp; c. to vary the measure .</p>
   <p>Mere translation I take to be impossible , if no metre were required . But the difference of the iambic and heroic measure destroys that at once . It is also impossible to obtain the same sense from a dead language and an ancient author , which those of his own time and country conceived ; words and phrases contract , from time and use , such strong shades of difference from their original import . In a living language , with the familiarity of a whole life , it is not easy to conceive truly the actual sense of current expressions , much less of older authors . No two languages furnish equipollent words ,— their phrases differ , their syntax and their idioms still more widely . But a translation , strictly so called , requires an exact conformity in all those particulars , and also in numbers ; therefore it is impossible . I really think at present , notwithstanding the opinion expressed in your preface , that a translator asks himself a good question , How would my author have expressed the sentence I am turning , in English , as literally and fully as the genius , and use , and character of the language will admit of ?</p>
   <p>In the passage before us , αττα was the fondling expression of childhood to its parent ; and to those who first translated the lines , conveyed feelingly that amiable sentiment . Γεραιε expressed the reverence which naturally accrues to age . Διοτρεφης implies an history . Hospitality was an article of religion ; strangers were supposed to be sent by God , and honoured accordingly . Jove 's altar was placed in ξενοδοχειον . Phoenix had been describing that as his situation in the court of Peleus ; and his Διοτρεφες refers to it . But you must not translate that literally —</p>
   <p>Old daddy Phoenix , a God-send for us to maintain .</p>
   <p>“ Precious limbs , ” was at first an expression of great feeling , till vagabonds , draymen , &amp; c ., brought upon it the character of coarseness and ridicule .</p>
   <p>It would run to great length , if I were to go through this one speech thus — this is enough for an example of my idea , and to prove the necessity of farther deviation ; which still is departing from the author , and justifiable only by strong necessity , such as should not be admitted , till the sense of the original had been laboured to the utmost and been found irreducible .</p>
   <p>I will end this by giving you the strictest translation I can invent , leaving you the double task of bringing it closer , and of polishing it into the style of poetry .</p>

   <p>I have thought that hero has contracted a different sense than it had in Homer 's time , and is better rendered great man : but I am aware that the enclitics and other little words , falsely called expletives , are not introduced even so much as the genius of our language would admit . The euphony I leave entirely to you . Adieu !</p>
   <p>TO THE LORD THURLOW .</p>
   <p>My Lord ,— We are of one mind as to the agreeable effect of rhyme , or euphony , in the lighter kinds of poetry . The pieces which your lordship mentions would certainly be spoiled by the loss of it , and so would all such . The “ Alma ” would lose all its neatness and smartness , and “ Hudibras ” all its humour . But in grave poems of extreme length , I apprehend that the case is different . Long before I thought of commencing poet myself , I have complained , and heard others complain , of the wearisomeness of such poems . Not that I suppose that tedium the effect of rhyme itself , but rather of the perpetual recurrence of the same pause and cadence , unavoidable in the English couplet . I hope , I may say truly , it was not in a spirit of presumption that I undertook to do what , in your lordship 's opinion , neither Dryden nor Pope would have dared to do . On the contrary , I see not how I could have escaped that imputation , had I followed Pope in his own way . A closer translation was called for . I verily believed that rhyme had betrayed Pope into his deviations . For me , therefore , to have used his mode of versifying , would have been to expose myself to the same miscarriage , at the same time that I had not his talents to atone for it .</p>
   <p>I agree with your lordship that a translation perfectly close is impossible , because time has sunk the original strict import of a thousand phrases , and we have no means of recovering it . But if we cannot be unimpeachably faithful , that is no reason why we should not be as faithful as we can ; and if blank verse affords the fairest chance , then it claims the preference .</p>
   <p>Your lordship , I will venture to say , can command me nothing in which I will not obey with the greatest alacrity .</p>
   <p>Ει δυναμαι τελεσαι γε , και ει τετειεσμενον εστι .</p>
   <p>But when , having made as close a translation as even you can invent , you enjoin me to make it still closer , and in rhyme too , I can only reply , as Horace to Augustus ,</p>
   <p>“ —— cupidum , pater optime , vires Deficiunt —— ”</p>
   <p>I have not treacherously departed from my pattern that I might seem to give some proof of the justness of my own opinion , but have fairly and honestly adhered as closely to it as I could . Yet your lordship will not have to compliment me on my success , either in respect of the poetical merit of my lines , or of their fidelity . They have just enough of each to make them deficient in the other .</p>

     <l n="11">Wounding his spirit , who has wounded mine .</l>
     <l n="12">Divide with me the honours of my throne —</l>
     <l n="13">These shall return , and make their tidings known ,</l>
     <l n="14">But go not thou — thy couch shall here be dress 'd</l>
     <l n="15">With softest fleeces for thy easy rest ,</l>
     <l n="16">And with the earliest blush of op'ning day</l>
     <l n="17">We will consult to seek our home , or stay .</l>

   <p>Since I wrote these I have looked at Pope 's . I am certainly somewhat closer to the original than he , but farther I say not . I shall wait with impatience for your lordship 's conclusions from these premises , and remain , in the meantime , with great truth , my lord , &amp; c .</p>

   <p>TO WILLIAM COWPER , ESQ .</p>
   <p>Dear Cowper ,— I have received your letter on my journey through London , and as the chaise waits I shall be short . I did not mean it as a sign of any presumption that you have attempted what neither Dryden nor Pope would have dared ; but merely as a proof of their addiction to rhyme ; for I am clearly convinced that Homer may be better translated than into rhyme , and that you have succeeded in the places I have looked into . But I have fancied that it might have been still more literal , preserving the ease of genuine English and melody , and some degree of that elevation which Homer derives from simplicity . But I could not do it , or even near enough to form a judgment , or more than a fancy about it . Nor do I fancy it could be done “ stans pede in uno . ” But when the mind has been fully impregnated with the original passage , often revolving it , and waiting for a happy moment , may still be necessary to the best trained mind . Adieu .</p>
   <p>THURLOW .</p>
   <p>TO THE LORD THURLOW .</p>
   <p>My Lord ,— I haunt you with letters , but will trouble you now with a short line , only to tell your lordship how happy I am that any part of my work has pleased you . I have a comfortable consciousness that the whole has been executed with equal industry and attention ; and am , my lord , with many thanks to you for snatching such a hasty moment to write to me , your lordship 's obliged and affectionate humble servant ,</p>

   <p>Having in a former part of this work contrasted the two versions of Cowper and Pope , we shall now close the subject , by quoting Cowper 's translation of some well-known and admired passages in the original poem . The classical reader will thus be enabled to determine how far the poet has succeeded in the application of his own principle , and retained the bold and lofty spirit of Homer , while he aims at transfusing his noble simplicity , and adhering strictly to his genuine meaning . We have selected the following specimens .</p>

     <l n="1">The hero ended , and his hands put forth</l>

     <l n="4">Shunning his touch ; for dreadful in his eyes</l>
     <l n="5">The brazen armour shone , and dreadful more</l>
     <l n="6">The shaggy crest , that swept his father 's brow .</l>
     <l n="7">Both parents smil 'd , delighted ; and the chief</l>
     <l n="8">Set down the crested terror on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="9">Then kiss 'd him , play 'd away his infant fears ,</l>
     <l n="10">And thus to Jove , and all the Pow'rs above :</l>
     <l n="11">Grant , O ye gods ! such eminent renown</l>
     <l n="12">And might in arms , as ye have giv'n to me ,</l>

     <l n="19">She wrapp 'd him in her bosom 's fragrant folds ,</l>

     <l n="21">Her dewy cheek strok 'd softly , and began .</l>
     <l n="22">Weep not for me , my love ! no mortal arm</l>

   <p>Without entering upon any minute analysis of the above passages , we consider them as exhibiting a happy specimen of poetic talent ; and that Cowper has been successful in exemplifying the rules and principles which , in his preface , he declares to be indispensable in a version of Homer .</p>
   <p>It may be interesting to literary curiosity to be presented with a summary of facts respecting Cowper 's two versions of Homer .</p>
   <p>This important undertaking commenced Nov. 21st , 1784 , and was completed August 25th , 1790 . During eight months of this intervening time , he was hindered by indisposition , so that he was occupied in the work , on the whole , five years and one month . On the 8th of September , 1790 , his kinsman , the Rev . John Johnson , conveyed the translation to Johnson , the bookseller in St. Paul 's Churchyard , with a view to its consignment to the press . During this period Cowper gave the work a second revisal , which he concluded March 4th , 1791 . On July 1st of the same year the publication issued from the press . In 1793 there was a further revision , with the addition of explanatory notes , a second edition having been called for . In 1796 he engaged in a revisal of the whole work , which , owing to his state of mind and declining health , was not finished till March 8th , 1799 . In January , 1800 , he new-modelled a passage in his translation of the Iliad , where mention is made of the very ancient sculpture , in which Dædalus had represented the Cretan dance for Ariadne . This proved to be the last effort of his pen .<span type="note_anchor">[ 646 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 646 ]</span>See Dr. Johnson 's sketch of the Life of Cowper .</p>
   <p>We have thought it due to Cowper 's version to enter thus largely into an examination of its merits , from a persuasion that an undertaking of this magnitude , executed by the author of “ The Task , ” claims to be considered as a part of our national literature . It remains only to be observed that the foreigner whom he mentions with so much estimation , as having aided him with his critical taste and erudition , was Fuseli the painter . He gratefully acknowledges his obligations in the following letters to Johnson the bookseller .</p>
   <p>Weston , Feb. 11 , 1790 .</p>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— I am very sensibly obliged by the remarks of Mr. Fuseli , and beg that you will tell him so ; they afford me opportunities of improvement which I shall not neglect . When he shall see the press-copy , he will be convinced of this , and will be convinced likewise , that , smart as he sometimes is , he spares me often , when I have no mercy on myself . He will see almost a new translation .... I assure you faithfully , that whatever my faults may be , to be easily or hastily satisfied with what I have written is not one of them .</p>
   <p>Sept. 7 , 1790 .</p>
   <p>It grieves me that , after all , I am obliged to go into public without the whole advantage of Mr. Fuseli 's judicious strictures . The only consolation is , that I have not forfeited them by my own impatience . Five years are no small portion of a man 's life , especially at the latter end of it , and in those five years , being a man of almost no engagements , I have done more in the way of hard work , than most could have done in twice the number . I beg you to present my compliments to Mr. Fuseli , with many and sincere thanks for the services that his own more important occupations would allow him to render me .</p>
   <p>We add one more letter in this place , addressed to his bookseller , to show with what becoming resolution he could defend his poetical opinions when he considered them to be just .</p>
   <p>Some accidental reviser of the manuscript had taken the liberty to alter a line in a poem of Cowper 's :— this liberty drew from the offended poet the following very just and animated remonstrance , which we are anxious to preserve , because it elucidates with great felicity of expression his deliberate ideas on English versification .</p>
   <p>“ I did not write the line that has been tampered with , hastily , or without due attention to the construction of it ; and what appeared to me its only merit is , in its present state , entirely annihilated .</p>
   <p>“ I know that ears of modern verse-writers are delicate to an excess , and their readers are troubled with the same squeamishness as themselves . So that if a line do not run as smooth as quicksilver , they are offended . A critic of the present day serves a poem as a cook serves a dead turkey , when she fastens the legs of it to a post , and draws out all the sinews . For this we may thank Pope ; but unless we could imitate him in the closeness and compactness of his expression , as well as in the smoothness of his numbers , we had better drop the imitation , which serves no other purpose than to emasculate and weaken all we write . Give me a manly rough line , with a deal of meaning in it , rather than a whole poem full of musical periods , that have nothing but their oily smoothness to recommend them !</p>
   <p>“ I have said thus much , as I hinted in the beginning , because I have just finished a much longer poem than the last , which our common friend will receive by the same messenger that has the charge of this letter . In that poem there are many lines which an ear so nice as the gentleman 's who made the above-mentioned alteration would undoubtedly condemn , and yet ( if I may be permitted to say it ) they cannot be made smoother without being the worse for it . There is a roughness on a plum , which nobody that understands fruit would rub off , though the plum would be much more polished without it . But , lest I tire you , I will only add , that I wish you to guard me from all such meddling , assuring you , that I always write as smoothly as I can , but that I never did , never will , sacrifice the spirit or sense of a passage to the sound of it . ”</p>
   <p>Cowper was much affected at this time by a severe indisposition , to which he alludes in the following letter .</p>

    <head>TO THOMAS PARK , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston Underwood , April 27 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— I write now merely to prevent any suspicion in your mind that I neglect you . I have been very ill , and for more than a fortnight unable to use the pen , or you should have heard long ere now of the safe arrival of your packet . I have revised the Elegy on Seduction ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 647 ]</span>but have not as yet been able to proceed farther . The best way of returning these which I have now in hand , will be to return them with those which you propose to send hereafter . I will make no more apologies for any liberties that it may seem necessary to me to take with your copies . Why do you send them , but that I may exercise that freedom , of which the very act of sending them implies your permission ? I will only say , therefore , that you must neither be impatient nor even allow yourself to think me tardy , since assuredly I will not be more so than I needs must be . My hands are pretty full . Milton must be forwarded , and is at present hardly begun ; and I have beside a numerous correspondence , which engrosses more of my time than I can at present well afford to it . I cannot decide with myself whether the lines in which the reviewers are so smartly noticed had better be expunged or not . Those lines are gracefully introduced and well written ; for which reasons I should be loath to part with them . On the other hand , how far it may be prudent to irritate a body of critics , who certainly much influence the public opinion , may deserve consideration . It may be added too , that they are not all equally worthy of the lash : there are among them men of real learning , judgment , and candour . I must leave it , therefore , to your own determination .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 647 ]</span>This Elegy is inserted in Mr. Park 's volume of sonnets and miscellaneous poems .</p>
   <p>I thank you for Thomson 's Epitaph , on which I have only to remark ( and I am sure that I do it not in a captious spirit ) that , since the poet is himself the speaker , I cannot but question a little the propriety of the quotation subjoined . It is a prayer , and when the man is buried , the time of prayer is over . I know it may be answered , that it is placed there merely for the benefit of the reader ; but all readers of tombstones are not wise enough to be trusted for such an interpretation .</p>
   <p>I was well pleased with your poem on * * and equally well pleased with your intention not to publish it . It proves two points of consequence to an author :— both that you have an exuberant fancy , and discretion enough to know how to deal with it . The man is formidable for his ludicrous talent , as he has made himself contemptible by his use of it . To despise him therefore is natural , but it is wise to do it in secret .</p>
   <p>Since the juvenile poems of Milton were edited by Warton , you need not trouble yourself to send them . I have them of his edition already .</p>
   <p>I am , dear sir , Affectionately yours , W. C .</p>
   <p>The marriage of Miss Stapleton , the Catharina of Cowper , to Sir John Throckmorton 's brother ( now Mr. Courtenay ,) was one of those events which the muse of Cowper had ventured to anticipate ; and he had now the happiness of finding his cherished wish fulfilled , and of thereby securing them as neighbours at the Hall .<span type="note_anchor">[ 648 ]</span></p>

    <head>TO LADY HESKETH</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , May 20 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Coz ,— I rejoice as thou reasonably supposest of me to do , in the matrimonial news communicated in your last . Not that it was altogether news for me , for twice I had received broad hints of it from Lady Frog , by letter , and several times vivâ voce while she was here , But she enjoined me secrecy as well as you , and you know that all secrets are safe with me ; safer far than the winds in the bags of Æolus . I know not , in fact , the lady whom it would give me more pleasure to call Mrs. Courtenay , than the lady in question ; partly because I know her , but especially because I know her to be all that I can wish in a neighbour .</p>
   <p>I have observed that there is a regular alternation of good and evil in the lot of men , so that a favourable incident may be considered as the harbinger of an unfavourable one , and vice versâ . Dr. Madan 's experience witnesses to the truth of this observation . One day he gets a broken head , and the next a mitre to heal it . I rejoice that he has met with so effectual a cure , though my joy is not unmingled with concern ; for till now I had some hope of seeing him , but since I live in the north , and his episcopal call is in the west , that is a gratification , I suppose , which I must no longer look for .</p>
   <p>My sonnet , which I sent you , was printed in the Northampton paper , last week , and this week it produced me a complimentary one in the same paper , which served to convince me , at least by the matter of it , that my own was not published without occasion , and that it had answered its purpose .<span type="note_anchor">[ 649 ]</span></p>

   <p>My correspondence with Hayley proceeds briskly , and is very affectionate on both sides . I expect him here in about a fortnight , and wish heartily , with Mrs. Unwin , that you would give him a meeting . I have promised him , indeed , that he shall find us alone , but you are one of the family .</p>
   <p>I wish much to print the following lines in one of the daily papers . Lord S .' s vindication of the poor culprit<span type="note_anchor">[ 650 ]</span>in the affair of Cheit Sing , has confirmed me in the belief that he has been injuriously treated , and I think it an act merely of justice to take a little notice of him .</p>

    <head>TO JOHN JOHNSON , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , May 20 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest of all Johnnies ,— I am not sorry that your ordination is postponed . A year 's learning and wisdom , added to your present stock , will not be more than enough to satisfy the demands of your function . Neither am I sorry that you find it difficult to fix your thoughts to the serious point at all times . It proves , at least , that you attempt , and wish to do it , and these are good symptoms . Woe to those who enter on the ministry of the gospel without having previously asked , at least from God , a mind and spirit suited to their occupation , and whose experience never differs from itself , because they are always alike vain , light , and inconsiderate . It is , therefore , matter of great joy to me to hear you complain of levity , and such it is to Mrs. Unwin . She is , I thank God , tolerably well , and loves you . As to the time of your journey hither , the sooner after June the better ; till then we shall have company .</p>
   <p>I forget not my debts to your dear sister , and your aunt Balls . Greet them both with a brother 's kiss , and place it to my account . I will write to them when Milton , and a thousand other engagements will give me leave . Mr. Hayley is here on a visit . We have formed a friendship that I trust will last for life , and render us an edifying example to all future poets .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! Lose no time in coming after the time mentioned .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>W. C .</head>
    <head>The reader is informed , by the close of the last letter , that Hayley was at this time the guest of Cowper . The meeting , so singularly produced , was a source of reciprocal delight ; and each looked cheerfully forward to the unclouded enjoyment of many social and literary hours .</head>
     <l n="1">Hayley 's account of this visit is too interesting , not to be</l>
     <l n="2">recorded in his own words .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ My host , though now in his sixty-first year , appeared as happily exempt from all the infirmities of advanced life , as friendship could wish him to be ; and his more elderly companion , not materially oppressed by age , discovered a benevolent alertness of character that seemed to promise a continuance of their domestic comfort . Their reception of me was kindness itself :— I was enchanted to find that the manners and conversation of Cowper resembled his poetry , charming by unaffected elegance , and the graces of a benevolent spirit . I looked with affectionate veneration and pleasure on the lady , who , having devoted her life and fortune to the service of this tender and sublime genius , in watching over him with maternal vigilance through many years of the darkest calamity , appeared to be now enjoying a reward justly due to the noblest exertions of friendship , in contemplating the health and the renown of the poet , whom she had the happiness to preserve .</p>
   <p>“ It seemed hardly possible to survey human nature in a more touching and a more satisfactory point of view . Their tender attention to each other , their simple , devout gratitude for the mercies which they had experienced together , and their constant , but unaffected propensity to impress on the mind and heart of a new friend , the deep sense which they incessantly felt , of their mutual obligations to each other , afforded me a very singular gratification ; which my reader will conceive the more forcibly , when he has perused the following exquisite sonnet , addressed by Cowper to Mrs. Unwin .</p>

   <p>“ The delight that I derived from a perfect view of the virtues , the talents , and the present domestic enjoyments of Cowper , was suddenly overcast by the darkest and most painful anxiety .</p>
   <p>“ After passing our mornings in social study , we usually walked out together at noon . In returning from one of our rambles around the pleasant village of Weston , we were met by Mr. Greatheed , an accomplished minister of the gospel , who resides at Newport-Pagnel , and whom Cowper described to me in terms of cordial esteem .</p>
   <p>“ He came forth to meet us as we drew near the house , and it was soon visible , from his countenance and manner , that he had ill news to impart . After the most tender preparation that humanity could devise , he acquainted Cowper that Mrs. Unwin was under the immediate pressure of a paralytic attack .</p>
   <p>“ My agitated friend rushed to the sight of the sufferer ;— he returned to me in a state that alarmed me in the highest degree for his faculties ;— his first speech to me was wild in the extreme ;— my answer would appear little less so ; but it was addressed to the predominant fancy of my unhappy friend , and , with the blessing of Heaven , it produced an instantaneous calm in his troubled mind .</p>
   <p>“ From that moment he rested on my friendship , with such mild and cheerful confidence , that his affectionate spirit regarded me as sent providentially to support him in a season of the severest affliction . ”</p>
   <p>The kindness of Hayley , at this critical moment , reflects the highest credit on his humanity and presence of mind . By means of an electrical machine , which the village of Weston fortunately supplied , he succeeded in relieving his suffering patient with the happiest effect . With this seasonable aid , seconded by a course of medicine recommended by Dr. Austen , an eminent London physician , and a friend of Hayley 's , the violence of the attack was gradually mitigated , and the agitated mind of Cowper greatly relieved .</p>
   <p>The progress of her recovery , and its influence on the tender spirit of Cowper , will sufficiently appear in the following letters .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO LADY HESKETH .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , May 24 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I wish with all my heart , my dearest Coz , that I had not ill news for the subject of the present letter . My friend , my Mary , has again been attacked by the same disorder that threatened me last year with the loss of her , and of which you were yourself a witness . Gregson would not allow that first stroke to be paralytic , but this he acknowledges to be so ; and with respect to the former , I never had myself any doubt that it was , but this has been much the severest . Her speech has been almost unintelligible from the moment that she was struck ; it is with difficulty that she opens her eyes , and she cannot keep them open ; the muscles necessary to the purpose being contracted ; and as to self-moving powers , from place to place , and the use of her right hand and arm , she has entirely lost them .</p>
   <p>It has happened well , that of all men living , the man most qualified to assist and comfort me is here ; though till within these few days I never saw him , and a few weeks since had no expectation that I ever should . You have already guessed that I mean Hayley — Hayley , who loves me as if he had known me from my cradle . When he returns to town , as he must , alas ! too soon , he will pay his respects to you .</p>
   <p>I will not conclude without adding , that our poor patient is beginning , I hope , to recover from this stroke also ; but her amendment is slow , as must be expected at her time of life and in such a disorder . I am as well myself as you have ever known me in a time of much trouble , and even better .</p>
   <p>It was not possible to prevail on Mrs. Unwin to let me send for Dr. Kerr , but Hayley has written to his friend , Dr. Austen , a representation of her case , and we expect his opinion and advice to-morrow . In the meantime , we have borrowed an electrical machine from our neighbour Socket , the effect of which she tried yesterday and the day before , and we think it has been of material service .</p>
   <p>She was seized while Hayley and I were walking , and Mr. Greatheed , who called while we were absent , was with her .</p>
   <p>I forgot in my last to thank thee for the proposed amendments of thy friend . Whoever he is , make my compliments to him , and thank him . The passages to which he objects have been all altered , and when he shall see them new dressed , I hope he will like them better .<span type="note_anchor">[ 651 ]</span></p>

   <p>My dearest Cousin ,— Knowing that you will be anxious to learn how we go on , I write a few lines to inform you that Mrs. Unwin daily recovers a little strength and a little power of utterance ; but she seems strongest , and her speech is more distinct , in a morning . Hayley has been all in all to us on this very afflictive occasion . Love him , I charge you , dearly , for my sake . Where could I have found a man , except himself , who could have made himself so necessary to me in so short a time , that I absolutely know not how to live without him ?</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear sweet coz . Mrs. Unwin , as plainly as her poor lips can speak , sends her best love , and Hayley threatens in a few days to lay close siege to your affections in person .</p>
   <p>W. C .</p>
   <p>There is some hope , I find , that the chancellor may continue in office , and I shall be glad if he does , because we have no single man worthy to succeed him .</p>
   <p>I open my letter again to thank you , my dearest coz , for yours just received . Though happy , as you well know , to see you at all times , we have no need , and I trust shall have none , to trouble you with a journey made on purpose ; yet once again , I am willing and desirous to believe , we shall be a happy trio at Weston ; but unless necessity dictates a journey of charity , I wish all yours hither to be made for pleasure . Farewell ! thou shalt know how we go on .</p>

   <p>Which words I place as conspicuously as possible , and prefix them to my letter , to save you the pain , my friend and brother , of a moment 's anxious speculation . Poor Mary proceeds in her amendment still , and improves , I think , even at a swifter rate than when you left her . The stronger she grows the faster she gathers strength , which is perhaps the natural course of recovery . She walked so well this morning , that she told me at my first visit she had entirely forgot her illness , and she spoke so distinctly , and had so much of her usual countenance , that had it been possible she would have made me forget it too .</p>
   <p>Returned from my walk , blown to tatters — found two dear things in the study , your letter and my Mary ! She is bravely well , and your beloved epistle does us both good . I found your kind pencil-note in my song-book , as soon as I came down on the morning of your departure , and Mary was vexed to the heart that the simpletons who watched her supposed her asleep when she was not , for she learned , soon after you were gone , that you would have peeped at her , had you known her to have been awake : I perhaps might have had a peep too , and was as vexed as she : but if it please God , we shall make ourselves large amends for all lost peeps by-and-by at Eartham .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Yesterday was a noble day with us — speech almost perfect — eyes open almost the whole day , without any effort to keep them so ; and the step wonderfully improved . But the night has been almost a sleepless one , owing partly I believe to her having had as much sleep again as usual the night before ; for even when she is in tolerable health she hardly ever sleeps well two nights together . I found her accordingly a little out of spirits this morning , but still insisting on it that she is better . Indeed she always tells me so , and will probably die with those very words upon her lips . They will be true then at least , for then she will be best of all . She is now ( the clock has just struck eleven ) endeavouring , I believe , to get a little sleep , for which reason I do not yet let her know that I have received your letter .</p>
   <p>Can I ever honour you enough for your zeal to serve me ? Truly I think not : I am however so sensible of the love I owe you on this account , that I every day regret the acuteness of your feelings for me , convinced that they expose you to much trouble , mortification , and disappointment . I have in short a poor opinion of my destiny , as I told you when you were here , and , though I believe that if any man living can do me good you will , I cannot yet persuade myself , that even you will be successful in attempting it . But it is no matter ; you are yourself a good , which I can never value enough , and , whether rich or poor in other respects , I shall always account myself better provided for than I deserve , with such a friend at my back as you . Let it please God to continue to me my William and Mary , and I will be more reasonable than to grumble .</p>
   <p>I rose this morning wrapt round with a cloud of melancholy , and with a heart full of fears , but if I see Mary 's amendment a little advanced when she rises , I shall be better .</p>
   <p>I have just been with her again . Except that she is fatigued for want of sleep , she seems as well as yesterday . The post brings me a letter from Hurdis , who is broken-hearted for a dying sister . Had we eyes sharp enough , we should see the arrows of death flying in all directions , and account it a wonder that we and our friends escape them but a single day .</p>

   <p>Of what materials can you suppose me made , if after all the rapid proofs that you have given me of your friendship , I do not love you with all my heart , and regret your absence continually ? But you must permit me to be melancholy now and then ; or if you will not , I must be so without your permission ; for that sable thread is so intermixed with the very thread of my existence as to be inseparable from it , at least while I exist in the body . Be content , therefore ; let me sigh and groan , but always be sure that I love you ! You will be well assured that I should not have indulged myself in this rhapsody about myself and my melancholy , had my present mood been of that complexion , or had not our poor Mary seemed still to advance in her recovery . So in fact she does , and has performed several little feats to-day ; such as either she could not perform at all , or very feebly , while you were with us .</p>
   <p>I shall be glad if you have seen Johnny as I call him , my Norfolk cousin ; he is a sweet lad , but as shy as a bird . It costs him always two or three days to open his mouth before a stranger ; but when he does , he is sure to please by the innocent cheerfulness of his conversation . His sister too is one of my idols , for the resemblance she bears to my mother .</p>
   <p>Mary and you have all my thoughts ; and how should it be otherwise ? She looks well , is better , and loves you dearly .</p>

   <p>I do indeed anxiously wish that every thing you do may prosper ; and should I at last prosper by your means , shall taste double sweetness in prosperity for that reason .</p>
   <p>I rose this morning , as I usually do , with a mind all in sables . In this mood I presented myself to Mary 's bedside , whom I found , though after many hours lying awake , yet cheerful , and not to be affected with my desponding humour . It is a great blessing to us both , that , poor feeble thing as she is , she has a most invincible courage , and a trust in God 's goodness , that nothing shakes . She is now in the study , and is certainly in some degree better than she was yesterday , but how to measure that little I know not , except by saying that it is just perceptible .</p>
   <p>I am glad that you have seen my Johnny of Norfolk , because I know it will be a comfort to you to have seen your successor . He arrived to my great joy , yesterday ; and , not having bound himself to any particular time of going , will , I hope , stay long with us . You are now once more snug in your retreat , and I give you joy of your return to it , after the bustle in which you have lived since you left Weston . Weston mourns your absence , and will mourn it till she sees you again . What is to become of Milton I know not ; I do nothing but scribble to you , and seem to have no relish for any other employment . I have , however , in pursuit of your idea to compliment Darwin , put a few stanzas together , which I shall subjoin ; you will easily give them all that you find they want , and match the song with another .</p>
   <p>I am now going to walk with Johnny , much cheered since I began writing to you , and by Mary 's looks and good spirits .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 653 ]</span>The celebrated poem of “ the Botanic Garden , ” originated in a copy of verses , addressed by Miss Seward to Dr. Darwin , complimenting him on his sequestered retreat near Lichfield . In this retreat there was a mossy fountain of the purest water ; aquatic plants bordered its summit , and branched from the fissures of the rock . There was also a brook , which he widened into small lakes . The whole scene formed a little paradise , and was embellished with various classes of plants , uniting the Linnean science , with all the charm of landscape .</p>
   <p>When Miss Seward presented her verses to Dr. Darwin , he was highly gratified , she observes , and said , “ I shall send this poem to the periodical publications ; but it ought to form the exordium of a great work . The Linnean system is unexplored poetic ground , and a happy subject for the muse . It affords fine scope for poetic landscape ; it suggests metamorphoses of the Ovidian kind , though reversed . Ovid made men and women into flowers , plants , and trees . You should make flowers , plants , and trees , into men and women . I , ” continued he , “ will write the notes , which must be scientific , and you shall write the verse . ”</p>
   <p>Miss S. remarked , that besides her want of botanic knowledge , the undertaking was not strictly proper for a female pen ; and that she felt how much more it was adapted to the ingenuity and vigour of his own fancy . After many objections urged on the part of Dr. Darwin , he at length acquiesced , and ultimately produced his “ Loves of the Plants , or Botanic Garden . "*</p>

    <head>TO LADY HESKETH .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , June 11 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Coz ,— Thou art ever in my thoughts , whether I am writing to thee or not , and my correspondence seems to grow upon me at such a rate that I am not able to address thee so often as I would . In fact , I live only to write letters , Hayley is as you see added to the number , and to him I write almost as duly as I rise in the morning ; nor is he only added , but his friend Carwardine also — Carwardine the generous , the disinterested , the friendly . I seem , in short , to have stumbled suddenly on a race of heroes , men who resolve to have no interests of their own till mine are served .</p>
   <p>But I will proceed to other matters , and that concern me more intimately , and more immediately , than all that can be done for me either by the great or the small , or by both united . Since I wrote last , Mrs. Unwin has been continually improving in strength , but at so gradual a rate that I can only mark it by saying that she moves about every day with less support than the former . Her recovery is most of all retarded by want of sleep . On the whole , I believe she goes on as well as could be expected , though not quite well enough to satisfy me . And Dr. Austen , speaking from the reports I have made of her , says he has no doubt of her restoration .</p>
   <p>During the last two months I seem to myself to have been in a dream . It has been a most eventful period , and fruitful to an uncommon degree , both in good and evil . I have been very ill , and suffered excruciating pain . I recovered , and became quite well again . I received within my doors a man , but lately an entire stranger , and who now loves me as a brother , and forgets himself to serve me . Mrs. Unwin has been seized with an illness that for many days threatened to deprive me of her , and to cast a gloom , an impenetrable one , on all my future prospects . She is now granted to me again . A few days since I should have thought the moon might have descended into my purse as likely as any emolument , and now it seems not impossible . All this has come to pass with such rapidity as events move with in romance indeed , but not often in real life . Events of all sorts creep or fly exactly as God pleases .</p>
   <p>To the foregoing I have to add in conclusion , the arrival of my Johnny , just when I wanted him most , and when only a few days before I had no expectation of him . He came to dinner on Saturday , and I hope I shall keep him long . What comes next I know not , but shall endeavour , as you exhort me , to look for good , and I know I shall have your prayer that I may not be disappointed .</p>
   <p>Hayley tells me you begin to be jealous of him , lest I should love him more than I love you , and bids me say , “ that , should I do so , you in revenge must love him more than I do . ” Him I know you will love , and me , because you have such a habit of doing it that you cannot help it .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! My knuckles ache with letter-writing . With my poor patient 's affectionate remembrances , and Johnny 's ,</p>
   <p>I am ever thine , W. C .</p>

   <p>... Thus have I filled a whole page to my dear William of Eartham , and have not said a syllable yet about my Mary . A sure sign that she goes on well . Be it known to you that we have these four days discarded our sedan with two elbows . Here is no more carrying , or being carried , but she walks up stairs boldly , with one hand upon the balustrade , and the other under my arm , and in like manner she comes down in a morning . Still I confess she is feeble , and misses much of her former strength . The weather too is sadly against her : it deprives her of many a good turn in the orchard , and fifty times have I wished this very day , that Dr. Darwin 's scheme of giving rudders and sails<span type="note_anchor">[ 654 ]</span>to the ice islands that spoil all our summers , were actually put into practice . So should we have gentle airs instead of churlish blasts , and those everlasting sources of bad weather being once navigated into the southern hemisphere , my Mary would recover as fast again . We are both of your mind respecting the journey to Eartham , and think that July , if by that time she have strength for the journey , will be better than August . We shall have more long days before us , and them we shall want as much for our return as for our going forth . This , however , must be left to the Giver of all good . If our visit to you be according to his will , he will smooth our way before us , and appoint the time of it ; and I thus speak , not because I wish to seem a saint in your eyes , but because my poor Mary actually is one , and would not set her foot over the threshold , unless she had , or thought she had , God 's free permission . With that she would go through floods and fire , though without it she would be afraid of everything — afraid even to visit you , dearly as she loves , and much as she longs to see you .</p>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 654 ]</span>That a very perceptible change , generally speaking , has taken place in the climate of Great Britain , and that the same observation applies to other countries , has been a frequent subject of remark , both with the past and present generation . Various causes have been assigned for this peculiarity . It has been said that nature is growing old , and losing its elasticity and vigour . Others have attributed the change to the vast accumulation of ice in the Polar regions , and its consequent influence on the temperature of the air . Dr. Darwin humorously suggested the scheme of giving rudders and sails to the Ice Islands , that they might be wafted by northern gales , and thus be absorbed by the heat of a southern latitude . It is worthy of remark that in Milton 's Latin Poems , there is a college thesis on this subject , viz . whether nature was becoming old and infirm . Milton took the negative of this proposition , and maintained , naturam non pati senium , that nature was not growing old . Cowper in his translation of this poem , thus renders some of the passages .</head>

   <p>Well then — let us talk about this journey to Eartham . You wish me to settle the time of it , and I wish with all my heart to be able to do so , living in hopes meanwhile that I shall be able to do it soon . But some little time must necessarily intervene . Our Mary must be able to walk alone , to cut her own food , feed herself , and to wear her own shoes , for at present she wears mine . All things considered , my friend and brother , you will see the expediency of waiting a little before we set off to Eartham . We mean indeed before that day arrives to make a trial of the strength of her head , how far it may be able to bear the motion of a carriage — a motion that it has not felt these seven years . I grieve that we are thus circumstanced , and that we cannot gratify ourselves in a delightful and innocent project without all these precautions ; but when we have leaf-gold to handle we must do it tenderly .</p>
   <p>I thank you , my brother , both for presenting my authorship<span type="note_anchor">[ 655 ]</span>to your friend Guy , and for the excellent verses with which you have inscribed your present . There are none neater or better turned — with what shall I requite you ? I have nothing to send you but a gimcrack , which I have prepared for my bride and bridegroom neighbours , who are expected to-morrow ! You saw in my book a poem entitled Catharina , which concluded with a wish that we had her for a neighbour :[ 656 ] this therefore is called</p>

   <p>I know not how you proceed in your life of Milton , but I suppose not very rapidly , for while you were here , and since you left us , you have had no other theme but me . As for myself , except my letters to you , and the nuptial song I inserted in my last , I have literally done nothing since I saw you . Nothing , I mean , in the writing way , though a great deal in another ; that is to say , in attending my poor Mary , and endeavouring to nurse her up for a journey to Eartham . In this I have hitherto succeeded tolerably well , and had rather carry this point completely than be the most famous editor of Milton that the world has ever seen or shall see .</p>
   <p>Your humorous descant upon my art of wishing made us merry , and consequently did good to us both . I sent my wish to the Hall yesterday . They are excellent neighbours , and so friendly to me that I wished to gratify them . When I went to pay my first visit , George flew into the court to meet me , and when I entered the parlour Catharina sprang into my arms .</p>

   <p>The progress of the old nurse in Terence is very much like the progress of my poor patient in the road of recovery . I cannot , indeed , say that she moves but advances not , for advances are certainly made , but the progress of a week is hardly perceptible . I know not therefore , at present , what to say about this long-postponed journey . The utmost that it is safe for me to say at this moment is this — You know that you are dear to us both : true it is that you are so , and equally true that the very instant we feel ourselves at liberty , we will fly to Eartham . I have been but once within the Hall door since the Courtenays came home , much as I have been pressed to dine there , and have hardly escaped giving a little offence by declining it : but , though I should offend all the world by my obstinacy in this instance , I would not leave my poor Mary alone . Johnny serves me as a representative , and him I send without scruple . As to the affair of Milton , I know not what will become of it . I wrote to Johnson a week since to tell him that , the interruption of Mrs. Unwin 's illness still continuing , and being likely to continue , I knew not when I should be able to proceed . The translations ( I said ) were finished , except the revisal of a part .</p>
   <p>God bless your dear little boy and poet ! I thank him for exercising his dawning genius upon me , and shall be still happier to thank him in person .</p>

   <p>I have sat twice ; and the few who have seen his copy of me are much struck with the resemblance . He is a sober , quiet man , which , considering that I must have him at least a week longer for an inmate , is a great comfort to me .</p>
   <p>My Mary sends you her best love . She can walk now , leaning on my arm only , and her speech is certainly much improved . I long to see you . Why cannot you and dear Tom spend the remainder of the summer with us ? We might then all set off for Eartham merrily together . But I retract this , conscious that I am unreasonable . It is a wretched world , and what we would is almost always what we cannot .</p>

   <p>Dear Sir ,— I have been long silent , and must now be short . My time since I wrote last has been almost wholly occupied in suffering . Either indisposition of my own , or of the dearest friend I have ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 658 ]</span>has so entirely engaged my attention , that , except the revision of the two elegies you sent me long since , I have done nothing ; nor do I at present foresee the day when I shall be able to do anything . Should Mrs. Unwin recover sufficiently to undertake a journey , I have promised Mr. Hayley to close the summer with a visit to him at Eartham . At the best , therefore , I cannot expect to proceed in my main business , till the approach of winter . I am thus thrown so much into arrear respecting Milton , that I already despair of being ready at the time appointed , and so I have told my employer .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 658 ]</span>Mrs. Unwin .</p>
   <p>I need not say that the drift of this melancholy preface is to apprize you that you must not expect despatch from me . Such expedition as I can use I will , but I believe you must be very patient .</p>
   <p>It was only one year that I gave to drawing , for I found it an employment hurtful to my eyes , which have always been weak and subject to inflammation . I finished my attempt in this way with three small landscapes , which I presented to a lady . These may , perhaps , exist , but I have now no correspondence with the fair proprietor . Except these , there is nothing remaining to show that I ever aspired to such an accomplishment .</p>
   <p>The hymns in the Olney collection marked ( C ,) are all of my composition , except one , which bears that initial by a mistake of the printer . Not having the book at hand , I cannot now say which it is .</p>
   <p>Wishing you a pleasant time at Margate , and assuring you , that I shall receive , with great pleasure , any drawing of yours with which you may favour me , and give it a distinguished place in my very small collection ,</p>

   <p>This important affair , my dear brother , is at last decided , and we are coming . Wednesday se'nnight , if nothing occur to make a later day necessary , is the day fixed for our journey . Our rate of travelling must depend on Mary 's ability to bear it . Our mode of travelling will occupy three days unavoidably , for we shall come in a coach . Abbot finishes my picture to-morrow ; on Wednesday he returns to town , and is commissioned to order one down for us , with four steeds to draw it ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Hollow pamper 'd jades of Asia ,</l>
     <l n="2">That cannot go but forty miles a day . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Send us our route , for I am as ignorant of it almost as if I were in a strange country . We shall reach St. Alban 's , I suppose , the first day ; say where we must finish our second day 's journey , and at what inn we may best repose ? As to the end of the third day , we know where that will find us , viz . in the arms , and under the roof , of our beloved Hayley .</p>
   <p>General Cowper , having heard a rumour of this intended migration , desires to meet me on the road , that we may once more see each other . He lives at Ham , near Kingston . Shall we go through Kingston or near it ? For I would give him as little trouble as possible , though he offers very kindly to come as far as Barnet for that purpose . Nor must I forget Carwardine , who so kindly desired to be informed what way we should go . On what point of the road will it be easiest for him to find us ? On all these points you must be my oracle . My friend and brother , we shall overwhelm you with our numbers ; this is all the trouble that I have left . My Johnny of Norfolk , happy in the thought of accompanying us , would be broken-hearted to be left behind .</p>
   <p>In the midst of all these solicitudes , I laugh to think what they are made of , and what an important thing it is for me to travel . Other men steal away from their homes silently , and make no disturbance , but when I move , houses are turned upside down , maids are turned out of their beds , all the counties through which I pass appear to be in an uproar — Surrey greets me by the mouth of the General , and Essex by that of Carwardine . How strange does all this seem to a man who has seen no bustle , and made none , for twenty years together !</p>

   <p>My dear Mr. Bull ,— Engaged as I have been ever since I saw you , it was not possible that I should write sooner ; and , busy as I am at present , it is not without difficulty that I can write even now : but I promised you a letter , and must endeavour , at least to be as good as my word . How do you imagine I have been occupied these last ten days ? In sitting , not on cockatrice ’ eggs , nor yet to gratify a mere idle humour , nor because I was too sick to move ; but because my cousin Johnson has an aunt who has a longing desire of my picture , and because he would , therefore , bring a painter from London to draw it . For this purpose I have been sitting , as I say , these ten days ; and am heartily glad that my sitting time is over . You have now , I know , a burning curiosity to learn two things , which I may choose whether I will tell you or not ; First , who was the painter ; and secondly , how he has succeeded . The painter 's name is Abbot . You never heard of him , you say . It is very likely ; but there is , nevertheless , such a painter , and an excellent one he is . Multa sunt quæ bonus Bernardus nec vidit , nec audivit . To your second inquiry I answer , that he has succeeded to admiration . The likeness is so strong , that when my friends enter the room where the picture is , they start , astonished to see me where they know I am not . Miserable man that you are , to be at Brighton instead of being here , to contemplate this prodigy of art , which , therefore , you can never see ; for it goes to London next Monday , to be suspended awhile at Abbot 's ; and then proceeds into Norfolk , where it will be suspended for ever .</p>
   <p>But the picture is not the only prodigy I have to tell you of . A greater belongs to me ; and one that you will hardly credit , even on my own testimony . We are on the eve of a journey , and a long one . On this very day se'nnight we set out for Eartham , the seat of my brother bard , Mr. Hayley , on the other side of London , nobody knows where , a hundred and twenty miles off . Pray for us , my friend , that we may have a safe going and return . It is a tremendous exploit , and I feel a thousand anxieties when I think of it . But a promise , made to him when he was here , that we would go if we could , and a sort of persuasion that we can if we will , oblige us to it . The journey , and the change of air , together with the novelty to us of the scene to which we are going , may , I hope , be useful to us both ; especially to Mrs. Unwin , who has most need of restoratives . She sends her love to you and to Thomas , in which she is sincerely joined by</p>
   <p>Your affectionate W. C .</p>

Fortunately for my intentions , it happens , that as the day approaches my terrors abate ; for had they continued to be what they were a week since , I must , after all , have disappointed you ; and was actually once on the verge of doing it . I have told you something of my nocturnal experiences , and assure you now , that they were hardly ever more terrific than on this occasion . Prayer has however opened my passage at last , and obtained for me a degree of confidence that I trust will prove a comfortable viaticum to me all the way . On Wednesday therefore we set forth .</p>
   <p>The terrors that I have spoken of would appear ridiculous to most , but to you they will not , for you are a reasonable creature , and know well that , to whatever cause it be owing ( whether to constitution , or to God 's express appointment ) I am hunted by spiritual hounds in the night season . I cannot help it . You will pity me , and wish it were otherwise ; and , though you may think there is much of the imaginary in it , will not deem it for that reason an evil less to be lamented — so much for fears and distresses . Soon I hope they shall all have a joyful termination , and I , my Mary , my Johnny , and my dog , be skipping with delight at Eartham !</p>
   <p>Well ! this picture is at last finished , and well finished , I can assure you . Every creature that has seen it has been astonished at the resemblance . Sam 's boy bowed to it , and Beau walked up to it , wagging his tail as he went , and evidently showing that he acknowledged its likeness to his master . It is a half-length , as it is technically but absurdly called ; that is to say , it gives all but the foot and ankle . To-morrow it goes to town , and will hang some months at Abbot 's , when it will be sent to its due destination in Norfolk .<span type="note_anchor">[ 660 ]</span></p>

   <p>I hope , or rather wish , that at Eartham I may recover that habit of study which , inveterate as it once seemed , I now seem to have lost — lost to such a degree , that it is even painful to me to think of what it will cost me to acquire it again .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! my dear , dear Hayley ; God give us a happy meeting . Mary sends her love — she is in pretty good plight this morning , having slept well , and for her part , has no fears at all about the journey .</p>
   <p>Ever yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— Like you , I am obliged to snatch short opportunities of corresponding with my friends ; and to write what I can , not what I would . Your kindness in giving me the first letter after your return claims my thanks ; and my tardiness to answer it would demand an apology , if , having been here , and witnessed how much my time is occupied in attendance on my poor patient , you could possibly want one . She proceeds , I trust , in her recovery ; but at so slow a rate , that the difference made in a week is hardly perceptible to me , who am always with her . This last night has been the worst she has known since her illness — entirely sleepless till seven in the morning . Such ill rest seems but an indifferent preparation for a long journey , which we purpose to undertake on Wednesday , when we set out for Eartham , on a visit to Mr. Hayley . The journey itself will , I hope , be useful to her ; and the air of the sea , blowing over the South Downs , together with the novelty of the scene to us , will , I hope , be serviceable to us both . You may imagine that we , who have been resident on one spot so many years , do not engage in such an enterprise without some anxiety . Persons accustomed to travel would make themselves merry with mine ; it seems so disproportioned to the occasion . Once I have been on the point of determining not to go , and even since we fixed the day ; my troubles have been so insupportable . But it has been made a matter of much prayer , and at last it has pleased God to satisfy me , in some measure , that his will corresponds with our purpose , and that He will afford us his protection . You , I know , will not be unmindful of us during our absence from home ; but will obtain for us , if your prayers can do it , all that we would ask for ourselves — the presence and favour of God , a salutary effect of our journey , and a safe return .</p>
   <p>I rejoiced , and had reason to do so , in your coming to Weston , for I think the Lord came with you . Not , indeed , to abide with me ; not to restore me to that intercourse with Him which I enjoyed twenty years ago ; but to awaken in me , however , more spiritual feeling than I have experienced , except in two instances , during all that time . The comforts that I had received under your ministry , in better days , all rushed upon my recollection ; and , during two or three transient moments , seemed to be in a degree renewed . You will tell me that , transient as they were , they were yet evidences of a love that is not so ; and I am desirous to believe it .</p>
   <p>With Mrs. Unwin 's warm remembrances , and my cousin Johnson 's best compliments , I am</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours , W. C .</p>
   <p>P. S .— If I hear from you while I am abroad , your letter will find me at William Hayley 's , Esq . Eartham , near Chichester . We propose to return in about a month .</p>
   <p>Cowper records the particulars of this visit in the following letters .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO THE REV . MR. GREATHEED .</head>
     <l n="1">Eartham , Aug. 6 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— Having first thanked you for your affectionate and acceptable letter , I will proceed , as well as I can , to answer your equally affectionate request , that I would send you early news of our arrival at Eartham . Here we are in the most elegant mansion that I have ever inhabited , and surrounded by the most delightful pleasure-grounds that I have ever seen ; but which , dissipated as my powers of thought are at present , I will not undertake to describe . It shall suffice me to say , that they occupy three sides of a hill , which in Buckinghamshire might well pass for a mountain , and from the summit of which is beheld a most magnificent landscape bounded by the sea , and in one part by the Isle of Wight , which may also be seen plainly from the window of the library , in which I am writing .</p>
   <p>It pleased God to carry us both through the journey with far less difficulty and inconvenience than I expected . I began it indeed with a thousand fears , and when we arrived the first evening at Barnet , found myself oppressed in spirit to a degree that could hardly be exceeded . I saw Mrs. Unwin weary , as she might well be , and heard such noises , both within the house and without , that I concluded she would get no rest . But I was mercifully disappointed . She rested , though not well , yet sufficiently ; and when we finished our next day 's journey at Ripley , we were both in better condition , both of body and mind , than on the day preceding . At Ripley we found a quiet inn , that housed , as it happened , that night , no company but ourselves . There we slept well , and rose perfectly refreshed ; and , except some terrors that I felt at passing over the Sussex hills by moonlight , met with little to complain of , till we arrived about ten o'clock at Eartham . Here we are as happy as it is in the power of terrestrial good to make us . It is almost a paradise in which we dwell ; and our reception has been the kindest that it was possible for friendship and hospitality to contrive . Our host mentions you with great respect , and bids me tell you that he esteems you highly . Mrs. Unwin , who is , I think , in some points , already the better for her excursion , unites with mine her best compliments both to yourself and Mrs. Greatheed . I have much to see and enjoy before I can be perfectly apprized of all the delights of Eartham , and will therefore now subscribe myself</p>
   <p>Yours , my dear sir , With great sincerity , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dearest Catharina ,— Though I have travelled far , nothing did I see in my travels that surprised me half so agreeably as your kind letter ; for high as my opinion of your good-nature is , I had no hopes of hearing from you till I should have written first ; a pleasure which I intended to allow myself the first opportunity .</p>
   <p>After three days ’ confinement in a coach , and suffering as we went all that could be suffered from excessive heat and dust , we found ourselves late in the evening at the door of our friend Hayley . In every other respect the journey was extremely pleasant . At the Mitre , in Barnet , where we lodged the first evening , we found our friend Rose , who had walked thither from his house in Chancery-lane to meet us ; and at Kingston , where we dined the second day , I found my old and much-valued friend , General Cowper , whom I had not seen in thirty years , and but for this journey should never have seen again . Mrs. Unwin , on whose account I had a thousand fears , before we set out , suffered as little from fatigue as myself , and begins , I hope , already to feel some beneficial effects from the air of Eartham , and the exercise that she takes in one of the most delightful pleasure-grounds in the world . They occupy three sides of a hill , lofty enough to command a view of the sea , which skirts the horizon to a length of many miles , with the Isle of Wight at the end of it . The inland scene is equally beautiful , consisting of a large and deep valley well cultivated , and enclosed by magnificent hills , all crowned with wood . I had , for my part , no conception that a poet could be the owner of such a paradise ; and his house is as elegant as his scenes are charming .<span type="note_anchor">[ 662 ]</span></p>

   <p>But think not , my dear Catharina , that amidst all these beauties I shall lose the remembrance of the peaceful , but less splendid , Weston . Your precincts will be as dear to me as ever , when I return ; though when that day will arrive I know not , our host being determined , as I plainly see , to keep us as long as possible . Give my best love to your husband . Thank him most kindly for his attention to the old bard of Greece , and pardon me that I do not now send you an epitaph for Fop . I am not sufficiently recollected to compose even a bagatelle at present ; but in due time you shall receive it .</p>
   <p>Hayley , who will some time or other I hope see you at Weston , is already prepared to love you both , and , being passionately fond of music , longs much to hear you .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— Romney is here : it would add much to my happiness if you were of the party ; I have prepared Hayley to think highly , that is justly , of you , and the time , I hope , will come when you will supersede all need of my recommendation .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin gathers strength . I have indeed great hopes , from the air and exercise which this fine season affords her opportunity to use , that ere we return she will be herself again .</p>

   <p>Wishes in this world are generally vain , and in the next we shall make none . Every day I wish you were of the party , knowing how happy you would be in a place where we have nothing to do but enjoy beautiful scenery and converse agreeably .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin 's health continues to improve ; and even I , who was well when I came , find myself still better .</p>

   <p>Without waiting for an answer to my last , I send my dear Catharina the epitaph she desired , composed as well as I could compose it in a place where every object , being still new to me , distracts my attention , and makes me as awkward at verse as if I had never dealt in it . Here it is .</p>

   <p>I am here , as I told you in my last , delightfully situated , and in the enjoyment of all that the most friendly hospitality can impart ; yet do I neither forget Weston , nor my friends at Weston : on the contrary , I have at length , though much and kindly pressed to make a longer stay , determined on the day of our departure — on the seventeenth of September we shall leave Eartham ; four days will be necessary to bring us home again , for I am under a promise to General Cowper to dine with him on the way , which cannot be done comfortably , either to him or to ourselves , unless we sleep that night at Kingston .</p>
   <p>The air of this place has been , I believe , beneficial to us both . I indeed was in tolerable health before I set out , but have acquired since I came , both a better appetite and a knack of sleeping almost as much in a single night as formerly in two . Whether double quantities of that article will be favourable to me as a poet , time must show . About myself , however , I care little , being made of materials so tough , as not to threaten me even now , at the end of so many lustrums , with any thing like a speedy dissolution . My chief concern has been about Mrs. Unwin , and my chief comfort at this moment is , that she likewise has received , I hope , considerable benefit by the journey .</p>
   <p>Tell my dear George that I begin to long to behold him again , and , did it not savour of ingratitude to the friend under whose roof I am so happy at present , should be impatient to find myself once more under yours .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! my dear Catharina . I have nothing to add in the way of news , except that Romney has drawn me in crayons , by the suffrage of all here , extremely like .</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . MR. HURDIS .<span type="note_anchor">[ 663 ]</span></head>
    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 663 ]</span>This amiable and much esteemed character , and endeared as one of the friends of Cowper , was born at Bishopstone in Sussex , in 1763 . He was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford in 1793 , and died at a premature age , in 1801 . His claims as an author principally rest on his once popular poem of the “ Village Curate . ” He also wrote “ A Vindication of the University of Oxford from the Aspersions of Mr. Gibbon . ” His works are published in 3 vols .</head>

   </lg>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— Your kind but very affecting letter found me not at Weston , to which place it was directed , but in a bower of my friend Hayley 's garden at Eartham , where I was sitting with Mrs. Unwin . We both knew the moment we saw it from whom it came , and , observing a red seal , both comforted ourselves that all was well at Burwash : but we soon felt that we were not called to rejoice , but to mourn with you ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 664 ]</span>we do indeed sincerely mourn with you , and , if it will afford you any consolation to know it , you may be assured that every eye here has testified what our hearts have suffered for you . Your loss is great , and your disposition I perceive such as exposes you to feel the whole weight of it : I will not add to your sorrow by a vain attempt to assuage it ; your own good sense , and the piety of your principles , will , of course , suggest to you the most powerful motives of acquiescence in the will of God . You will be sure to recollect that the stroke , severe as it is , is not the stroke of an enemy , but of a father ; and will find I trust , hereafter , that like a father he has done you good by it . Thousands have been able to say , and myself as loud as any of them , it has been good for me that I was afflicted ; but time is necessary to work us to this persuasion , and in due time it shall be yours . Mr. Hayley , who tenderly sympathizes with you , has enjoined me to send you as pressing an invitation as I can frame , to join me at this place . I have every motive to wish your consent ; both your benefit and my own , which , I believe , would be abundantly answered by your coming , ought to make me eloquent in such a cause . Here you will find silence and retirement in perfection , when you would seek them ; and here such company as I have no doubt would suit you , all cheerful , but not noisy ; and all alike disposed to love you : you and I seem to have here a fair opportunity of meeting . It were a pity we should be in the same county and not come together . I am here till the seventeenth of September , an interval that will afford you time to make the necessary arrangements , and to gratify me at last with an interview , which I have long desired . Let me hear from you soon , that I may have double pleasure , the pleasure of expecting as well as that of seeing you .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 664 ]</span>Mr. Hurdis had just lost a favourite sister .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin , I thank God , though still a sufferer by her last illness , is much better , and has received considerable benefit by the air of Eartham . She adds to mine her affectionate compliments , and joins me and Hayley in this invitation .</p>
   <p>Mr. Romney is here , and a young man a cousin of mine . I tell you who we are , that you may not be afraid of us .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! May the Comforter of all the afflicted , who seek him , be yours ! God bless you !</p>

   <p>I know not how it is , my dearest coz , but , in a new scene and surrounded with strange objects , I find my powers of thinking dissipated to a degree , that makes it difficult to me even to write a letter , and even a letter to you ; but such a letter as I can , I will , and have the fairest chance to succeed this morning , Hayley , Romney , Hayley 's son , and Beau , being all gone together to the sea for bathing . The sea , you must know , is nine miles off , so that , unless stupidity prevent , I shall have opportunity to write not only to you , but to poor Hurdis also , who is broken-hearted for the loss of his favourite sister , lately dead ; and whose letter , giving an account of it , which I received yesterday , drew tears from the eyes of all our party . My only comfort respecting even yourself is , that you write in good spirits , and assure me that you are in a state of recovery ; otherwise I should mourn not only for Hurdis , but for myself , lest a certain event should reduce me , and in a short time too , to a situation as distressing as his ; for though nature designed you only for my cousin , you have had a sister 's place in my affections ever since I knew you . The reason is , I suppose , that , having no sister , the daughter of my own mother , I thought it proper to have one , the daughter of yours . Certain it is , that I can by no means afford to lose you , and that , unless you will be upon honour with me to give me always a true account of yourself , at least when we are not together , I shall always be unhappy , because always suspicious that you deceive me .</p>
   <p>Now for ourselves . I am , without the least dissimulation , in good health ; my spirits are about as good as you have ever seen them ; and if increase of appetite , and a double portion of sleep , be advantageous , such are the advantages that I have received from this migration . As to that gloominess of mind , which I have had these twenty years , it cleaves to me even here , and , could I be translated to Paradise , unless I left my body behind me , would cleave to me even there also . It is my companion for life , and nothing will ever divorce us . So much for myself . Mrs. Unwin is evidently the better for her jaunt , though by no means as she was before this last attack ; still wanting help when she would rise from her seat , and a support in walking ; but she is able to use more exercise than she could at home , and moves with rather a less tottering step . God knows what he designs for me , but when I see those who are dearer to me than myself distempered and enfeebled , and myself as strong as in the days of my youth , I tremble for the solitude in which a few years may place me . I wish her and you to die before me , but not till I am more likely to follow immediately . Enough of this !</p>
   <p>Romney has drawn me in crayons , and , in the opinion of all here , with his best hand , and with the most exact resemblance possible .<span type="note_anchor">[ 665 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 665 ]</span>This portrait is now in the possession of Dr. Johnson 's family .</p>
   <p>The seventeenth of September is the day on which I intend to leave Eartham . We shall then have been six weeks resident here ; a holiday time long enough for a man who has much to do . And now , farewell !</p>

   <p>Dear Madam ,— Your two counsellors are of one mind . We both are of opinion that you will do well to make your second volume a suitable companion to the first , by embellishing it in the same manner ; and have no doubt , considering the well-deserved popularity of your verse , that the expense will be amply refunded by the public .</p>
   <p>I would give you , madam , not my counsel only , but consolation also , were I not disqualified for that delightful service by a great dearth of it in my own experience . I too often seek but cannot find it . Of this , however , I can assure you , if that may at all comfort you , that both my friend Hayley and myself most truly sympathize with you under all your sufferings . Neither have you , I am persuaded , in any degree lost the interest you always had in him , or your claim to any service that it may be in his power to render you . Had you no other title to his esteem , his respect for your talents , and his feelings for your misfortunes , must ensure to you the friendship of such a man for ever . I know , however , there are seasons when , look which way we will , we see the same dismal gloom enveloping all objects . This is itself an affliction ; and the worse , because it makes us think ourselves more unhappy than we are : and at such a season it is , I doubt not , that you suspect a diminution of our friend 's zeal to serve you .</p>
   <p>I was much struck by an expression in your letter to Hayley , where you say that you “ will endeavour to take an interest in green leaves again . ” This seems the sound of my own voice reflected to me from a distance ; I have so often had the same thought and desire . A day scarcely passes , at this season of the year , when I do not contemplate the trees so soon to be stript , and say , “ Perhaps I shall never see you clothed again . ” Every year , as it passes , makes this expectation more reasonable ; and the year with me cannot be very distant , when the event will verify it . Well , may God grant us a good hope of arriving in due time where the leaves never fall , and all will be right !</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin , I think , is a little better than when you saw her ; but still so feeble as to keep me in a state of continual apprehension . I live under the point of a sword suspended by a hair . Adieu , my dear madam ; and believe me to remain your sincere and affectionate humble servant ,</p>

     <l n="1">Eartham , Sept. 9 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Cousin ,— I determine , if possible , to send you one more letter , or at least , if possible , once more to send you something like one , before we leave Eartham . But I am in truth so unaccountably local in the use of my pen , that , like the man in the fable , who could leap well no where but at Rhodes , I seem incapable of writing at all , except at Weston . This is , as I have already told you , a delightful place ; more beautiful scenery I have never beheld , nor expect to behold ; but the charms of it , uncommon as they are , have not in the least alienated my affections from Weston . The genius of that place suits me better , it has an air of snug concealment , in which a disposition like mine feels peculiarly gratified ; whereas here I see from every window woods like forests , and hills like mountains , a wildness , in short , that rather increases my natural melancholy , and which , were it not for the agreeables I find within , would soon convince me that mere change of place can avail me little . Accordingly , I have not looked out for a house in Sussex , nor shall .</p>
   <p>The intended day of our departure continues to be the seventeenth . I hope to re-conduct Mrs. Unwin to the Lodge with her health considerably mended ; but it is in the article of speech chiefly , and in her powers of walking , that she is sensible of much improvement . Her sight and her hand still fail her , so that she can neither read nor work ; both mortifying circumstances to her , who is never willingly idle .</p>
   <p>On the eighteenth I purpose to dine with the General , and to rest that night at Kingston , but the pleasure I shall have in the interview will hardly be greater than the pain I shall feel at the end of it , for we shall part , probably to meet no more .</p>
   <p>Johnny , I know , has told you that Mr. Hurdis is here . Distressed by the loss of his sister , he has renounced the place where she died for ever , and is about to enter on a new course of life at Oxford . You would admire him much , he is gentle in his manners , and delicate in his person , resembling our poor friend , Unwin , both in face and figure , more than any one I have seen . But he has not , at least he has not at present , his vivacity .</p>
   <p>I have corresponded since I came here with Mrs. Courtenay , and had yesterday a very kind letter from her .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear ; may God bless you . Write to me as soon as you can after the twentieth . I shall then be at Weston , and indulging myself in the hope that I shall ere long see you there also .</p>

   <p>Hayley , speaking of the manner in which they employed their time at Eartham , observes , “ Homer was not the immediate object of our attention . The morning hours that we could bestow upon books were chiefly devoted to a complete revisal and correction of all the translations , which my friend had finished , from the Latin and Italian poetry of Milton : and we generally amused ourselves after dinner in forming together a rapid metrical version of Andreini 's Adamo . "[ 667 ] He also mentions the interest excited in Cowper 's mind by his son , a fine boy of eleven years , whose uncommon talents and engaging qualities endeared him so much to the poet , that he allowed and invited him to criticise his Homer . A specimen of this juvenile criticism will appear in the future correspondence . This interesting boy , with a young companion , employed themselves regularly twice a day in drawing Mrs. Unwin in a commodious garden-chair , round the airy hill at Eartham . “ To Cowper and to me , ” he adds , “ it was a very pleasing spectacle to see the benevolent vivacity of blooming youth thus continually labouring for the ease , health , and amusement of disabled age . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 667 ]</span>This is one of those scarce and curious books which is not to be procured without difficulty . It is a dramatic representation of the Fall , remarkable , not so much for any peculiar vigour , either in the conception or execution of the plan , as for exhibiting that mode of celebrating sacred subjects , formerly known under the appellation of mysteries . A further interest is also attached to it from the popular persuasion that this work first suggested to Milton the design of his Paradise Lost . There is the same allegorical imagery , and sufficient to form the frame-work of that immortal poem . Johnson , in his Life of Milton , alludes to the report , without arriving at any decided conclusion on the subject , but states , that Milton 's original intention was to have formed , not a narrative , but a dramatic work , and that he subsequently began to reduce it to its present form , about the year 1655 . Some sketches of this plan are to be seen in the library of Trinity College , Cambridge . Dr. Joseph Warton and Hayley both incline to the opinion that the Adamo of Andreini first suggested the hint of the Paradise Lost .</p>
   <p>That the Italians claim this honour for their countryman is evident from the following passage from Tiraboschi , which , to those of our readers who are conversant with that language , will be an interesting quotation . “ Certo benche L'Adamo dell Andreini sia in confronto dell Paradiso Perduto ciò che è il Poema di Ennio in confronto a quel di Virgilio , nondimeno non può negarsi che le idee gigantesche , delle quali l'autore Inglese ha abbellito il suo Poema , di Satana , che entra nel Paradiso terrestre , e arde d'invidia al vedere la felicita dell ’ Uomo , del congresso de Demonj , della battaglia degli Angioli contra Lucifero , e più altre sommiglianti immagini veggonsi nell ’ Adamo adombrate per modo , che a me sembra molto credibile , che anche il Milton dalle immondezze , se cosi è lecito dire , dell ’ Andreini raccogliesse l'oro , di cui adorno il suo Poema . Per altro L'Adamo dell ’ Andreini , benche abbia alcuni tratti di pessimo gusto , ne hà altri ancora , che si posson proporre come modello di excellente poesia . ”</p>
   <p>It is no disparagement to Milton to have been indebted to the conceptions of another for the origin of his great undertaking . If Milton borrowed , it was to repay with largeness of interest . The only use that he made of the suggestion was , to stamp upon it the immortality of his own creative genius , and to produce a work which is destined to survive to the latest period of British literature .</p>
   <p>For further information on this subject , we refer the reader to the “ Inquiry into the Origin of Paradise Lost , ” in Todd 's excellent edition of Milton ; and in Hayley 's Life of Milton will be found Cowper 's and Hayley 's joint version of the first three acts of the Adamo above mentioned .</p>
   <p>In addition to the Adamo of Andreini , Milton is said to have been indebted to the Du Bartas of Sylvester , and to the Adamus Exul of Grotius . Hayley , in his Life of Milton , enumerates also a brief list of Italian writers , who may have possibly have thrown some suggestions into the mind of the poet . But the boldest act of imposition ever recorded in the annals of literature , is the charge preferred against Milton by Lauder , who endeavoured to prove that he was “ the worst and greatest of all plagiaries . ” He asserted that “ Milton had borrowed the substance of whole books together , and that there was scarcely a single thought or sentiment in his poem which he had not stolen from some author or other , notwithstanding his vain pretence to things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme . ” In support of this charge , he was base enough to corrupt the text of those poets , whom he produced as evidences against the originality of Milton , by interpolating several verses either of his own fabrication , or from the Latin translation of Paradise Lost , by William Hog . This gross libel he entitled an “ Essay on Milton 's Use and Imitation of the Moderns ; ” and so far imposed on Dr. Johnson , by his representations , as to prevail upon him to furnish a preface to his work . The public are indebted to Dr. Douglas , the Bishop of Salisbury , for first detecting this imposture , in a pamphlet entitled “ Milton vindicated from the charge of Plagiarism brought against him by Mr. Lauder . ” Thus exposed to infamy and contempt , he made a public recantation of his error , and soon after quitted England for the West Indies , where he died in 1771 .</p>
   <p>The reader will perceive from the last letter , that Cowper , amused as he was with the scenery of Sussex , began to feel the powerful attraction of home .</p>

   <p>My dear Catharina ,— I am not so uncourteous a knight as to leave your last kind letter , and the last I hope that I shall receive for a long time to come , without an attempt , at least , to acknowledge and to send you something in the shape of an answer to it ; but , having been obliged to dose myself last night with laudanum , on account of a little nervous fever , to which I am always subject , and for which I find it the best remedy , I feel myself this morning particularly under the influence of Lethean vapours , and , consequently , in danger of being uncommonly stupid !</p>
   <p>You could hardly have sent me intelligence that would have gratified me more than that of my two dear friends , Sir John and Lady Throckmorton , having departed from Paris two days before the terrible 10th of August . I have had many anxious thoughts on their account ; and am truly happy to learn that they have sought a more peaceful region , while it was yet permitted them to do so . They will not , I trust , revisit those scenes of tumult and horror while they shall continue to merit that description . We are here all of one mind respecting the cause in which the Parisians are engaged ; wish them a free people , and as happy as they can wish themselves . But their conduct has not always pleased us : we are shocked at their sanguinary proceedings , and begin to fear , myself in particular , that they will prove themselves unworthy , because incapable of enjoying it , of the inestimable blessing of liberty . My daily toast is , Sobriety and freedom to the French ; for they seem as destitute of the former as they are eager to secure the latter .</p>
   <p>We still hold our purpose of leaving Eartham on the seventeenth ; and again my fears on Mrs. Unwin 's account begin to trouble me ; but they are now not quite so reasonable as in the first instance . If she could bear the fatigue of travelling then , she is more equal to it at present ; and , supposing that nothing happens to alarm her , which is very probable , may be expected to reach Weston in much better condition than when she left it . Her improvement , however , is chiefly in her looks , and in the articles of speaking and walking ; for she can neither rise from her chair without help , nor walk without a support , nor read , nor use her needle . Give my love to the good doctor , and make him acquainted with the state of his patient , since he , of all men , seems to have the best right to know it .</p>
   <p>I am proud that you are pleased with the Epitaph<span type="note_anchor">[ 670 ]</span>I sent you , and shall be still prouder to see it perpetuated by the chisel . It is all that I have done since here I came , and all that I have been able to do . I wished , indeed , to have requited Romney , for his well-drawn copy of me , in rhyme ; and have more than once or twice attempted it : but I find , like the man in the fable , who could leap only at Rhodes , that verse is almost impossible to me , except at Weston .— Tell my friend George that I am every day mindful of him , and always love him ; and bid him by no means to vex himself about the tardiness of Andrews .<span type="note_anchor">[ 671 ]</span>Remember me affectionately to William , and to Pitcairn , whom I shall hope to find with you at my return ; and , should you see Mr. Buchanan , to him also . I have now charged you with commissions enow , and having added Mrs. Unwin 's best compliments , and told you that I long to see you again , will conclude myself ,</p>
   <p>My dear Catharina , Most truly yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>Their departure from Eartham was a scene of affecting interest , and a perfect contrast to the gaiety of their arrival . Anxious to relieve the mind of Hayley from any apprehension for their safety , Cowper addressed to him the following letter from Kingston .</p>

   <p>My dear Brother ,— With no sinister accident to retard or terrify us , we find ourselves at a quarter before one , arrived safe at Kingston . I left you with a heavy heart , and with a heavy heart took leave of our dear Tom ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 672 ]</span>at the bottom of the chalk-hill . But , soon after this last separation , my troubles gushed from my eyes , and then I was better .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 672 ]</span>Hayley 's son .</p>
   <p>We must now prepare for our visit to the General . I add no more , therefore , than our dearest remembrances and prayers that God may bless you and yours , and reward you an hundred-fold for all your kindness . Tell Tom I shall always hold him dear for his affectionate attentions to Mrs. Unwin . From her heart the memory of him can never be erased . Johnny loves you all , and has his share in all these acknowledgements .</p>

   <p>My dear Hayley ,— Chaos himself , even the chaos of Milton , is not surrounded with more confusion , nor has a mind more completely in a hubbub , than I experience at the present moment . At our first arrival , after long absence , we find a hundred orders to servants necessary , a thousand things to be restored to their proper places , and an endless variety of minutiæ to be adjusted ; which , though individually of little importance , are momentous in the aggregate . In these circumstances I find myself so indisposed to writing , that , save to yourself , I would on no account attempt it ; but to you I will give such a recital as I can of all that has passed since I sent you that short note from Kingston , knowing that , if it be a perplexed recital , you will consider the cause and pardon it . I will begin with a remark in which I am inclined to think you will agree with me , that there is sometimes more true heroism passing in a corner , and on occasions that make no noise in the world , than has often been exercised by those whom that world esteems her greatest heroes , and on occasions the most illustrious . I hope so at least ; for all the heroism I have to boast , and all the opportunities I have of displaying any , are of a private nature . After writing the note , I immediately began to prepare for my appointed visit to Ham ; but the struggles that I had with my own spirit , labouring as I did under the most dreadful dejection , are never to be told . I would have given the world to have been excused . I went , however , and carried my point against myself , with a heart riven asunder — I have reasons for all this anxiety , which I cannot relate now . The visit , however , passed off well , and we returned in the dark to Kingston ; I , with a lighter heart than I had known since my departure from Eartham , and Mary too , for she had suffered hardly less than myself , and chiefly on my account . That night we rested well in our inn , and at twenty minutes after eight next morning set off for London ; exactly at ten we reached Mr. Rose 's door ; we drank a dish of chocolate with him , and proceeded , Mr. Rose riding with us as far as St. Albans . From this time we met with no impediment . In the dark , and in a storm , at eight at night , we found ourselves at our own back-door . Mrs. Unwin was very near slipping out of the chair in which she was taken from the chaise , but at last was landed safe . We all have had a good night , and are all well this morning .</p>
   <p>God bless you , my dearest brother .</p>

   <p>My dear Hayley ,— A bad night , succeeded by an east wind , and a sky all in sables , have such an effect on my spirits , that , if I did not consult my own comfort more than yours , I should not write to-day , for I shall not entertain you much : yet your letter , though containing no very pleasant tidings , has afforded me some relief . It tells me , indeed , that you have been dispirited yourself , and that poor little Tom , the faithful ‘ squire of my Mary , has been seriously indisposed . All this grieves me : but then there is a warmth of heart and a kindness in it that do me good . I will endeavour not to repay you in notes of sorrow and despondence , though all my sprightly chords seem broken . In truth , one day excepted , I have not seen the day when I have been cheerful since I left you . My spirits , I think , are almost constantly lower than they were ; the approach of winter is perhaps the cause , and if it is , I have nothing better to expect for a long time to come .</p>
   <p>Yesterday was a day of assignation with myself , the day of which I said some days before it came , when that day comes I will begin my dissertations . Accordingly , when it came , I prepared to do so ; filled a letter-case with fresh paper , furnished myself with a pretty good pen , and replenished my ink-bottle ; but , partly from one cause , and partly from another , chiefly , however , from distress and dejection , after writing and obliterating about six lines , in the composition of which I spent near an hour , I was obliged to relinquish the attempt . An attempt so unsuccessful could have no other effect than to dishearten me , and it has had that effect to such a degree , that I know not when I shall find courage to make another . At present I shall certainly abstain , since at present I cannot well afford to expose myself to the danger of a fresh mortification .</p>

   <p>I began a letter to you yesterday , my dearest brother , and proceeded through two sides of the sheet , but so much of my nervous fever found its way into it , that , looking over it this morning , I determined not to send it .</p>
   <p>I have risen , though not in good spirits , yet in better than I generally do of late , and therefore will not address you in the melancholy tone that belongs to my worst feelings .</p>
   <p>I began to be restless about your portrait , and to say , how long shall I have to wait for it ? I wished it here for many reasons : the sight of it will be a comfort to me , for I not only love but am proud of you , as of a conquest made in my old age . Johnny goes to town on Monday , on purpose to call on Romney , to whom he shall give all proper information concerning its conveyance hither . The name of a man whom I esteem as I do Romney , ought not to be unmusical in my ears ; but his name will be so till I shall have paid him a debt justly due to him , by doing such poetical honours to it as I intend . Heaven knows when that intention will be executed , for the muse is still as obdurate and as coy as ever .</p>
   <p>Your kind postscript is just arrived , and gives me great pleasure . When I cannot see you myself , it seems some comfort , however , that you have been seen by another known to me ; and who will tell me in a few days that he has seen you . Your wishes to disperse my melancholy would , I am sure , prevail , did that event depend on the warmth and sincerity with which you frame them ; but it has baffled both wishes and prayers , and those the most fervent that could be made , so many years , that the case seems hopeless . But no more of this at present .</p>
   <p>Your verses to Austen are as sweet as the honey that they accompany : kind , friendly , witty , and elegant ! When shall I be able to do the like ? Perhaps when my Mary , like your Tom , shall cease to be an invalid , I may recover a power , at least , to do something . I sincerely rejoice in the dear little man 's restoration . My Mary continues , I hope , to mend a little .</p>

   <p>My dear Madam ,— Your kind inquiries after mine and Mrs. Unwin 's health will not permit me to be silent ; though I am and have long been so indisposed to writing , that even a letter has almost overtasked me .</p>
   <p>Your last but one found me on the point of setting out for Sussex , whither I went with Mrs. Unwin , on a visit to my friend , Mr. Hayley . We spent six weeks at Eartham , and returned on the nineteenth of September . I had hopes that change of air and change of scene might be serviceable both to my poor invalid and me . She , I hope , has received some benefit ; and I am not the worse for it myself ; but , at the same time , must acknowledge that I cannot boast of much amendment . The time we spent there could not fail to pass as agreeably as her weakness , and my spirits , at a low ebb , would permit . Hayley is one of the most agreeable men , as well as one of the most cordial friends . His house is elegant ; his library large , and well chosen ; and he is surrounded by the most delightful scenery . But I have made the experiment only to prove , what indeed I knew before , that creatures are physicians of little value , and that health and cure are from God only . Henceforth , therefore , I shall wait for those blessings from Him , and expect them at no other hand . In the meantime , I have the comfort to be able to tell you that Mrs. Unwin , on the whole , is restored beyond the most sanguine expectations I had when I wrote last ; and that , as to myself , it is not much otherwise with me than it has been these twenty years ; except that this season of the year is always unfavourable to my spirits .</p>
   <p>I rejoice that you have had the pleasure of another interview with Mr. Martyn ; and am glad that the trifles I have sent you afforded him any amusement . This letter has already given you to understand that I am at present no artificer of verse ; and that , consequently , I have nothing new to communicate . When I have , I shall do it to none more readily than to yourself .</p>
   <p>My dear madam , Very affectionately yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I thought that the wonder had been all on my side , having been employed in wondering at your silence , as long as you at mine . Soon after our arrival at Eartham , I received a letter from you , which I answered , if not by the return of the post , at least in a day or two . Not that I should have insisted on the ceremonial of letter for letter , during so long a period , could I have found leisure to double your debt ; but while there , I had no opportunity for writing , except now and then a short one ; for we breakfasted early , studied Milton as soon as breakfast was over , and continued in that employment till Mrs. Unwin came forth from her chamber , to whom all the rest of my time was necessarily devoted . Our return to Weston was on the nineteenth of last month , according to your information . You will naturally think that , in the interval , I must have had sufficient leisure to give you notice of our safe arrival . But the fact has been otherwise . I have neither been well myself , nor is Mrs. Unwin , though better , so much improved in her health as not still to require my continual assistance . My disorder has been the old one , to which I have been subject so many years , and especially about this season — a nervous fever ; not , indeed , so oppressive as it has sometimes proved , but sufficiently alarming both to Mrs. Unwin and myself , and such as made it neither easy nor proper for me to make much use of my pen while it continued . At present I am tolerably free from it ; a blessing for which I believe myself partly indebted to the use of James 's powder , in small quantities ; and partly to a small quantity of laudanum , taken every night ; but chiefly to a manifestation of God 's presence vouchsafed to me a few days since ; transient , indeed , and dimly seen through a mist of many fears and troubles , but sufficient to convince me , at least while the Enemy 's power is a little restrained , that He has not cast me off for ever .</p>
   <p>Our visit was a pleasant one ; as pleasant as Mrs. Unwin 's weakness and the state of my spirits , never very good , would allow . As to my own health , I never expected that it would be much improved by the journey ; nor have I found it so . Some benefit , indeed , I hoped ; and , perhaps , a little more than I found . But the season was , after the first fortnight , extremely unfavourable , stormy , and wet ; and the prospects , though grand and magnificent , yet rather of a melancholy cast , and consequently not very propitious to me . The cultivated appearance of Weston suits my frame of mind far better than wild hills that aspire to be mountains , covered with vast unfrequented woods , and here and there affording a peep between their summits at the distant ocean . Within doors all was hospitality and kindness , but the scenery would have its effect ; and , though delightful in the extreme to those who had spirits to bear it , was too gloomy for me .</p>
   <p>Yours , my dear friend , Most sincerely , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— You are too useful when you are here not to be missed on a hundred occasions daily ; and too much domesticated with us not to be regretted always . I hope , therefore , that your month or six weeks will not be like many that I have known , capable of being drawn out into any length whatever , and productive of nothing but disappointment .</p>
   <p>I have done nothing since you went , except that I have composed the better half of a sonnet to Romney ; yet even this ought to bear an earlier date , for I began to be haunted with a desire to do it long before we came out of Sussex , and have daily attempted it ever since .</p>
   <p>It would be well for the reading part of the world , if the writing part were , many of them , as dull as I am . Yet even this small produce , which my sterile intellect has hardly yielded at last , may serve to convince you that in point of spirits I am not worse .</p>
   <p>In fact , I am a little better . The powders and the laudanum together have , for the present at least , abated the fever that consumes them ; and in measure as the fever abates , I acquire a less discouraging view of things , and with it a little power to exert myself .</p>
   <p>In the evenings I read Baker 's Chronicle to Mrs. Unwin , having no other history , and hope in time to be as well versed in it , as his admirer Sir Roger de Coverley .</p>

   <p>You do well to sit for your picture , and give very sufficient reasons for doing it ; you will also , I doubt not , take care that , when future generations shall look at it , some spectator or other shall say , this is the picture of a good man and a useful one .</p>
   <p>And now God bless you , my dear Johnny . I proceed much after the old rate ; rising cheerless and distressed in the morning , and brightening a little as the day goes on .</p>

   <p>Nothing done , my dearest brother , nor likely to be done at present ; yet I purpose in a day or two to make another attempt , to which , however , I shall address myself with fear and trembling , like a man who , having sprained his wrist , dreads to use it . I have not , indeed , like such a man , injured myself by any extraordinary exertion , but seem as much enfeebled as if I had . The consciousness that there is so much to do , and nothing done , is a burden I am not able to bear . Milton especially is my grievance , and I might almost as well be haunted by his ghost as goaded with continual reproaches for neglecting him . I will therefore begin ; I will do my best ; and if , after all , that best prove good for nothing , I will even send the notes , worthless as they are , that I have made already ; a measure very disagreeable to myself , and to which nothing but necessity shall compel me . I shall rejoice to see those new samples of your biography ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 675 ]</span>which you give me to expect .</p>

   <p>Allons ! Courage !— Here comes something however ; produced after a gestation as long as that of a pregnant woman . It is the debt long unpaid , the compliment due to Romney ; and if it has your approbation , I will send it , or you may send it for me . I must premise , however , that I intended nothing less than a sonnet when I began . I know not why , but I said to myself , it shall not be a sonnet ; accordingly I attempted it in one sort of measure , then in a second , then in a third , till I had made the trial in half a dozen different kinds of shorter verse , and behold it is a sonnet at last . The fates would have it so .</p>

   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— I have done nothing since you went , except that I have finished the Sonnet which I told you I had begun , and sent it to Hayley , who is well pleased therewith , and has by this time transmitted it to whom it most concerns .</p>
   <p>I would not give the algebraist sixpence for his encomiums on my Task , if he condemns my Homer , which , I know , in point of language , is equal to it , and in variety of numbers superior . But the character of the former having been some years established , he follows the general cry ; and should Homer establish himself as well , and I trust he will hereafter , I shall have his warm suffrage for that also . But if not — it is no matter . Swift says somewhere ,— There are a few good judges of poetry in the world , who lend their taste to those who have none : and your man of figures is probably one of the borrowers .</p>
   <p>Adieu — in great haste . Our united love attends yourself and yours , whose I am most truly and affectionately .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I wish that I were as industrious and as much occupied as you , though in a different way ; but it is not so with me . Mrs. Unwin 's great debility ( who is not yet able to move without assistance ) is of itself a hindrance such as would effectually disable me . Till she can work , and read , and fill up her time as usual ( all which is at present entirely out of her power ) I may now and then find time to write a letter , but I shall write nothing more . I cannot sit with my pen in my hand and my books before me , while she is in effect in solitude , silent , and looking at the fire . To this hindrance that other has been added , of which you are already aware , a want of spirits , such as I have never known , when I was not absolutely laid by , since I commenced an author . How long I shall be continued in these uncomfortable circumstances is known only to Him who , as he will , disposes of us all . I may be yet able , perhaps , to prepare the first book of the Paradise Lost for the press , before it will be wanted ; and Johnson himself seems to think there will be no haste for the second . But poetry is my favourite employment , and all my poetical operations are in the meantime suspended ; for , while a work to which I have bound myself remains unaccomplished , I can do nothing else .</p>
   <p>Johnson 's plan of prefixing my phiz to the new edition of my poems is by no means a pleasant one to me , and so I told him in a letter I sent him from Eartham , in which I assured him that my objections to it would not be easily surmounted . But if you judge that it may really have an effect in advancing the sale , I would not be so squeamish as to suffer the spirit of prudery to prevail in me to his disadvantage . Somebody told an author , I forget whom , that there was more vanity in refusing his picture than in granting it , on which he instantly complied . I do not perfectly feel all the force of the argument , but it shall content me that he did .</p>
   <p>I do most sincerely rejoice in the success of your publication ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 677 ]</span>and have no doubt that my prophecy concerning your success in greater matters will be fulfilled . We are naturally pleased when our friends approve what we approve ourselves ; how much then must I be pleased , when you speak so kindly of Johnny ! I know him to be all that you think him , and love him entirely .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I am not so insensible of your kindness in making me an exception from the number of your correspondents , to whom you forbid the hope of hearing from you till your present labours are ended , as to make you wait longer for an answer to your last ; which , indeed , would have had its answer before this time , had it been possible for me to write . But so many have demands upon me of a similar kind , and , while Mrs. Unwin continues an invalid , my opportunities of writing are so few , that I am constrained to incur a long arrear to some , with whom I would wish to be punctual . She can at present neither work nor read ; and , till she can do both , and amuse herself as usual , my own amusements of the pen must be suspended .</p>
   <p>I , like you , have a work before me , and a work to which I should be glad to address myself in earnest , but cannot do it at present . When the opportunity comes , I shall , like you , be under a necessity of interdicting some of my usual correspondents , and of shortening my letters to the excepted few . Many letters and much company are incompatible with authorship , and the one as much as the other . It will be long , I hope , before the world is put in possession of a publication , which you design should be posthumous .</p>
   <p>Oh for the day when your expectations of my complete deliverance shall be verified ! At present it seems very remote : so distant , indeed , that hardly the faintest streak of it is visible in my horizon . The glimpse , with which I was favoured about a month since , has never been repeated ; and the depression of my spirits has . The future appears gloomy as ever ; and I seem to myself to be scrambling always in the dark , among rocks and precipices , without a guide , but with an enemy ever at my heels , prepared to push me headlong . Thus I have spent twenty years , but thus I shall not spend twenty years more . Long ere that period arrives , the grand question concerning my everlasting weal or woe will be decided .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear friend . I have exhausted my time , though not filled my paper .</p>
   <p>Truly yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— I give you many thanks for your rhymes , and your verses without rhyme ; for your poetical dialogue between wood and stone : between Homer 's head , and the head of Samuel ; kindly intended , I know very well , for my amusement , and that amused me much .</p>
   <p>The successor of the clerk defunct , for whom I used to write , arrived here this morning , with a recommendatory letter from Joe Rye , and an humble petition of his own , entreating me to assist him as I had assisted his predecessor . I have undertaken the service , although with no little reluctance , being involved in many arrears on other subjects , and having very little dependence at present on my ability to write at all . I proceed exactly as when you were here — a letter now and then before breakfast , and the rest of my time all holiday ; if holiday it may be called , that is spent chiefly in moping and musing , and “ forecasting the fashion of uncertain evils . ”</p>
   <p>The fever on my spirits has harassed me much , and I have never had so good a night , nor so quiet a rising , since you went , as on this very morning ; a relief that I account particularly seasonable and propitious , because I had , in my intentions , devoted this morning to you , and could not have fulfilled those intentions , had I been as spiritless as I generally am .</p>
   <p>I am glad that Johnson is in no haste for Milton , for I seem myself not likely to address myself presently to that concern , with any prospect of success ; yet something now and then , like a secret whisper , assures and encourages me that it will yet be done .</p>

   <p>How shall I thank you enough for the interest you take in my future Miltonic labours , and the assistance you promise me in the performance of them ; I will some time or other , if I live , and live a poet , acknowledge your friendship in some of my best verse ; the most suitable return one poet can make to another : in the meantime , I love you , and am sensible of all your kindness . You wish me warm in my work , and I ardently wish the same : but when I shall be so God only knows . My melancholy , which seemed a little alleviated for a few days , has gathered about me again with as black a cloud as ever ; the consequence is absolute incapacity to begin .</p>
   <p>I was for some years dirge-writer to the town of Northampton , being employed by the clerk of the principal parish there to furnish him with an annual copy of verses proper to be printed at the foot of his bill of mortality ; but the clerk died , and , hearing nothing for two years from his successor , I well hoped that I was out of my office . The other morning however Sam announced the new clerk ; he came to solicit the same service as I had rendered his predecessor , and I reluctantly complied ; doubtful , indeed , whether I was capable . I have however achieved that labour , and I have done nothing more . I am just sent for up to Mary , dear Mary ! Adieu ! she is as well as when I left you , I would I could say better . Remember us both affectionately to your sweet boy , and trust me for being</p>
   <p>Most truly yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— You need not be uneasy on the subject of Milton . I shall not find that labour too heavy for me , if I have health and leisure . The season of the year is unfavourable to me respecting the former ; and Mrs. Unwin 's present weakness allows me less of the latter than the occasion seems to call for . But the business is in no haste . The artists employed to furnish the embellishments are not likely to be very expeditious ; and a small portion only of the work will be wanted from me at once ; for the intention is to deal it out to the public piece-meal . I am , therefore , under no great anxiety on that account . It is not , indeed , an employment that I should have chosen for myself ; because poetry pleases and amuses me more , and would cost me less labour , properly so called . All this I felt before I engaged with Johnson ; and did , in the first instance , actually decline the service ; but he was urgent ; and , at last , I suffered myself to be persuaded .</p>
   <p>The season of the year , as I have already said , is particularly adverse to me : yet not in itself , perhaps , more adverse than any other ; but the approach of it always reminds me of the same season in the dreadful seventy-three , and in the more dreadful eighty-six . I cannot help terrifying myself with doleful misgivings and apprehensions ; nor is the enemy negligent to seize all the advantage that the occasion gives him . Thus , hearing much from him , and having little or no sensible support from God , I suffer inexpressible things till January is over . And even then , whether increasing years have made me more liable to it , or despair , the longer it lasts , grows naturally darker , I find myself more inclined to melancholy than I was a few years since . God only knows where this will end ; but where it is likely to end , unless he interpose powerfully in my favour , all may know .</p>
   <p>I remain , my dear friend , most sincerely yours , W. C .</p>

     <l n="1">Weston , Dec. 16 , 1792 .</l>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— We differ so little , that it is pity we should not agree . The possibility of restoring our diseased government is , I think , the only point on which we are not of one mind . If you are right , and it cannot be touched in the medical way , without danger of absolute ruin to the constitution , keep the doctors at a distance say I — and let us live as long as we can . But perhaps physicians might be found of skill sufficient for the purpose , were they but as willing as able . Who are they ? Not those honest blunderers , the mob , but our governors themselves . As it is in the power of any individual to be honest if he will , any body of men are , as it seems to me , equally possessed of the same option . For I can never persuade myself to think the world so constituted by the Author of it , and human society , which is his ordinance , so shabby a business , that the buying and selling of votes and consciences should be essential to its existence . As to multiplied representation I know not that I foresee any great advantage likely to arise from that . Provided there be but a reasonable number of reasonable heads laid together for the good of the nation , the end may as well be answered by five hundred as it would be by a thousand , and perhaps better . But then they should be honest as well as wise , and , in order that they may be so , they should put it out of their own power to be otherwise . This they might certainly do if they would ; and , would they do it , I am not convinced that any great mischief would ensue . You say , “ somebody must have influence , ” but I see no necessity for it . Let integrity of intention and a due share of ability be supposed , and the influence will be in the right place ; it will all centre in the zeal and good of the nation . That will influence their debates and decisions , and nothing else ought to do it . You will say , perhaps , that wise men , and honest men , as they are supposed , they are yet liable to be split into almost as many differences of opinion as there are individuals ; but I rather think not . It is observed of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough , that each always approved and seconded the plans and views of the other ; and the reason given for it is that they were men of equal ability . The same cause that could make two unanimous would make twenty so , and would at least secure a majority among as many hundreds .</p>
   <p>As to the reformation of the church , I want none , unless by a better provision for the inferior clergy ; and , if that could be brought about by emaciating a little some of our too corpulent dignitaries , I should be well contented .</p>
   <p>The dissenters , I think , Catholics and others , have all a right to the privileges of all other Englishmen , because to deprive them is persecution , and persecution on any account , but especially on a religious one , is an abomination . But after all , valeat respublica . I love my country , I love my king , and I wish peace and prosperity to Old England .<span type="note_anchor">[ 680 ]</span></p>
   <p>Adieu , W. C .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 680 ]</span>The question of a Reform in Parliament was at this time beginning to engage the public attention , and Mr. Grey ( now Earl Grey ) had recently announced his intention in the House of Commons of bringing forward that important subject in the ensuing session of Parliament . It was accordingly submitted to the House , May 6th , 1793 , when Mr. Grey delivered his sentiments at considerable length , embodying many of the topics now so familiar to the public , but by no means pursuing the principle to the extent since adopted . The debate lasted till two o'clock in the morning , when it was adjourned to the following day . After a renewed discussion , which continued till four in the morning , the House divided , when the numbers were as follow , viz . Ayes 40 , Noes 282 .</p>
   <p>It is interesting to mark this first commencement of the popular question of Reform ( if we except Mr. Pitt 's measure , in 1782 ) and to contrast its slow progress with the final issue , under the same leader , in the year 1832 . The minority for several successive years seldom exceeded the amount above specified , though the measure was at length carried by so large a majority .</p>

     <l n="1">Weston-Underwood , Dec. 17 , 1792 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— You are very kind in thinking it worth while to inquire after so irregular a correspondent . When I had read your last , I persuaded myself that I had answered your obliging letter received while I was at Eartham , and seemed clearly to remember it ; but upon better recollection , am inclined to think myself mistaken , and that I have many pardons to ask for neglecting to do it so long .</p>
   <p>While I was at Mr. Hayley 's I could hardly find opportunity to write to anybody . He is an early riser and breakfasts early , and unless I could rise early enough myself to despatch a letter before breakfast , I had no leisure to do it at all . For immediately after breakfast we repaired to the library , where we studied in concert till noon ; and the rest of my time was so occupied by necessary attention to my poor invalid , Mrs. Unwin , and by various other engagements , that to write was impossible .</p>
   <p>Since my return , I have been almost constantly afflicted with weak and inflamed eyes , and indeed have wanted spirits as well as leisure . If you can , therefore , you must pardon me ; and you will do it perhaps the rather , when I assure you that not you alone , but every person and every thing that had demands upon me has been equally neglected . A strange weariness that has long had dominion over me has indisposed and indeed disqualified me for all employment ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 681 ]</span>and my hindrances besides have been such that I am sadly in arrear in all quarters . A thousand times I have been sorry and ashamed that your MSS . are yet unrevised , and if you knew the compunction that it has cost me , you would pity me : for I feel as if I were guilty in that particular , though my conscience tells me that it could not be otherwise .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 681 ]</span>This expression alludes to the nervous fever and great depression of spirits that Cowper laboured under , in the months of October and November , and which has been frequently mentioned in the preceding correspondence .</p>
   <p>Before I received your letter written from Margate , I had formed a resolution never to be engraven , and was confirmed in it by my friend Hayley 's example . But , learning since , though I have not learned it from himself , that my bookseller has an intention to prefix a copy of Abbot 's picture of me<span type="note_anchor">[ 682 ]</span>to the next edition of my poems , at his own expense , if I can be prevailed upon to consent to it ; in consideration of the liberality of his behaviour , I have felt my determination shaken . This intelligence , however , comes to me from a third person , and till it reaches me in a direct line from Johnson , I can say nothing to him about it . When he shall open to me his intentions himself , I will not be backward to mention to him your obliging offer , and shall be particularly gratified , if I must be engraved at last , to have that service performed for me by a friend .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 682 ]</span>There were three portraits of Cowper , taken respectively by Sir Thomas Lawrence , Abbot , and Romney . The reader may be anxious to learn which is entitled to be considered the best resemblance . The editor is able to satisfy this inquiry , on the joint authority of the three most competent witnesses , the late Rev . Dr. Johnson , the present Dowager Lady Throckmorton , and John Higgins , Esq ., formerly of Weston . They all agree in assigning the superiority to the portrait by Abbot ; and in evidence of this , all have repeated the anecdote mentioned by Cowper , of his dog Beau going up to the picture , and shaking his tail , in token of recognition . It is an exact resemblance of his form , features , manner , and costume . That by Romney was said to resemble him at the moment it was taken , but it was his then look , not his customary and more placid features . There is an air of wildness in it , expressive of a disordered mind , and which the shock , produced by the paralytic attack of Mrs. Unwin , was rapidly impressing on his countenance . This portrait has always been considered as awakening distressing emotions in the beholder . The portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence is the most pleasing , but not so exact and faithful a resemblance . There is however a character of peculiar interest in it , and he is represented in the cap which he was accustomed to wear in a morning , presented to him by Lady Hesketh . It was on this picture that the following beautiful lines were composed by the late Rev . Dr. Randolph .</p>

   <p>That I may not be silent , till my silence alarms you , I snatch a moment to tell you , that although toujours triste I am not worse than usual , but my opportunities of writing are paucified , as , perhaps , Dr. Johnson would have dared to say , and the few that I have are shortened by company .</p>
   <p>Give my love to dear Tom , and thank him for his very apposite extract , which I should be happy indeed to turn to any account . How often do I wish , in the course of every day , that I could be employed once more in poetry , and how often , of course , that this Miltonic trap had never caught me ! The year ninety-two shall stand chronicled in my remembrance as the most melancholy that I have ever known , except the few weeks that I spent at Eartham ; and such it has been principally because , being engaged to Milton , I felt myself no longer free for any other engagement . That ill-fated work , impracticable in itself , has made every thing else impracticable .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— A few lines must serve to introduce to you my much-valued friend Mr. Rose , and to thank you for your very obliging attention in sending me so approved a remedy for my disorder . It is no fault of yours , but it will be a disappointment to you to know , that I have long been in possession of that remedy , and have tried it without effect ; or , to speak more truly , with an unfavourable one . Judging by the pain it causes , I conclude that it is of the caustic kind , and may , therefore , be sovereign in cases where the eyelids are ulcerated ; but mine is a dry inflammation , which it has always increased as often as I have used it . I used it again , after having long since resolved to use it no more , that I might not seem , even to myself , to slight your kindness , but with no better effect than in every former instance .</p>
   <p>You are very candid in crediting so readily the excuse I make for not having yet revised your MSS ., and as kind in allowing me still longer time . I refer you for a more particular account of the circumstances that make all literary pursuits at present impracticable to me , to the young gentleman who delivers this into your hands .<span type="note_anchor">[ 684 ]</span>He is perfectly master of the subject , having just left me after having spent a fortnight with us .</p>

   <p>You must extend your charity still a little farther , and excuse a short answer to your two obliging letters . I do every thing with my pen in a hurry , but will not conclude without entreating you to make my thanks and best compliments to the lady ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 685 ]</span>who was so good as to trouble herself for my sake to write a character of the medicine .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dear Brother ,— Now I know that you are safe , I treat you , as you see , with a philosophical indifference , not acknowledging your kind and immediate answer to anxious inquiries , till it suits my own convenience . I have learned , however , from my late solicitude , that not only you , but yours , interest me to a degree , that , should any thing happen to either of you , would be very inconsistent with my peace . Sometimes I thought that you were extremely ill , and once or twice that you were dead . As often some tragedy reached my ear concerning little Tom . “ Oh , vanæ mentes hominum ! ” How liable are we to a thousand impositions , and how indebted to honest old Time , who never fails to undeceive us ! Whatever you had in prospect , you acted kindly by me not to make me partaker of your expectations ; for I have a spirit , if not so sanguine as yours , yet that would have waited for your coming with anxious impatience , and have been dismally mortified by the disappointment . Had you come , and come without notice too , you would not have surprised us more , than ( as the matter was managed ) we were surprised at the arrival of your picture . It reached us in the evening , after the shutters were closed , at a time when a chaise might actually have brought you without giving us the least previous intimation . Then it was , that Samuel , with his cheerful countenance , appeared at the study door , and with a voice as cheerful as his looks , exclaimed , “ Mr. Hayley is come , madam ! ” We both started , and in the same moment cried , “ Mr. Hayley come ! And where is he ? ” The next moment corrected our mistake , and , finding Mary 's voice grow suddenly tremulous , I turned and saw her weeping .</p>
   <p>I do nothing , notwithstanding all your exhortations : my idleness is proof against them all , or to speak more truly , my difficulties are so . Something indeed I do . I play at pushpin with Homer every morning before breakfast , fingering and polishing , as Paris did his armour . I have lately had a letter from Dublin on that subject , which has pleased me .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Hayley ,— I truly sympathize with you under your weight of sorrow for the loss of our good Samaritan .<span type="note_anchor">[ 687 ]</span>But be not broken-hearted , my friend ! Remember the loss of those we love is the condition on which we live ourselves ; and that he who chooses his friends wisely from among the excellent of the earth , has a sure ground to hope concerning them when they die , that a merciful God has made them far happier than they could be here , and that we shall join them soon again . This is solid comfort , could we but avail ourselves of it ; but I confess the difficulty of doing so . Sorrow is like the deaf adder , “ that hears not the voice of the charmer , charm he never so wisely ; ” and I feel so much myself for the death of Austen , that my own chief consolation is , that I had never seen him . Live yourself , I beseech you , for I have seen so much of you that I can by no means spare you , and I will live as long as it shall please God to permit . I know you set some value on me , therefore let that promise comfort you , and give us not reason to say , like David 's servant — “ We know that it would have pleased thee more if all we had died , than this one , for whom thou art inconsolable . ” You have still Romney , and Carwardine , and Guy , and me , my poor Mary , and I know not how many beside ; as many , I suppose , as ever had an opportunity of spending a day with you . He who has the most friends must necessarily lose the most , and he whose friends are numerous as yours may the better spare a part of them . It is a changing , transient scene : yet a little while , and this poor dream of life will be over with all of us . The living , and they who live unhappy , they are indeed subjects of sorrow .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! my beloved friend . Ever yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— Even as you foretold , so it came to pass . On Tuesday I received your letter , and on Tuesday came the pheasants ; for which I am indebted in many thanks , as well as Mrs. Unwin , both to your kindness and to your kind friend Mr. Copeman .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In Copeman 's ear this truth let Echo tell ,—</l>
     <l n="2">“ Immortal bards like mortal pheasants well : ”</l>
     <l n="3">And when his clerkship 's out , I wish him herds</l>
     <l n="4">Of golden clients for his golden birds .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Our friends the Courtenays have never dined with us since their marriage , because we have never asked them ; and we have never asked them , because poor Mrs. Unwin is not so equal to the task of providing for and entertaining company as before this last illness . But this is no objection to the arrival here of a bustard ; rather it is a cause for which we shall be particularly glad to see the monster . It will be a handsome present to them . So let the bustard come , as the Lord Mayor of London said of the hare , when he was hunting — let her come , a ’ God 's name : I am not afraid of her .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear cousin and caterer . My eyes are terribly bad ; else , I had much more to say to you .</p>
   <p>Ever affectionately yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>In this last revisal of my work ( the Homer ) I have made a number of small improvements , and am now more convinced than ever , having exercised a cooler judgment upon it than before I could , that the translation will make its way . There must be time for the conquest of vehement and long-rooted prejudice ; but , without much self-partiality , I believe , that the conquest will be made ; and am certain that I should be of the same opinion , were the work another man 's . I shall soon have finished the Odyssey , and when I have , will send the corrected copy of both to Johnson .</p>

   <p>A-propos of the Rose ! His wife in her political notions is the exact counterpart of yourself — loyal in the extreme . Therefore , if you find her thus inclined , when you become acquainted with her , you must not place her resemblance of yourself to the account of her admiration of you , for she is your likeness ready made . In fact , we are all of one mind about government matters , and notwithstanding your opinion , the Rose is himself a Whig , and I am a Whig , and you , my dear , are a Tory , and all the Tories now-a-days call all the Whigs republicans . How the deuce you came to be a Tory is best known to yourself : you have to answer for this novelty to the shades of your ancestors , who were always Whigs ever since we had any .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I have read the critique of my work in the Analytical Review , and am happy to have fallen into the hands of a critic , rigorous enough indeed , but a scholar , and a man of sense , and who does not deliberately intend me mischief . I am better pleased indeed that he censures some things than I should have been with unmixed commendation , for his censure ( to use the new diplomatic term ) will accredit his praises . In his particular remarks he is for the most part right , and I shall be the better for them ; but in his general ones I think he asserts too largely , and more than he could prove . With respect to inversions in particular , I know that they do not abound . Once they did , and I had Milton 's example for it , not disapproved by Addison . But on —— ‘ s remonstrance against them , I expunged the most , and in my new edition shall have fewer still . I know that they give dignity , and am sorry to part with them ; but , to parody an old proverb , he who lives in the year ninety-three , must do as in the year ninety-three is done by others . The same remark I have to make on his censure of inharmonious lines . I know them to be much fewer than he asserts , and not more in number than I accounted indispensably necessary to a due variation of cadence . I have , however , now , in conformity with modern taste , ( over much delicate in my mind ,) given to a far greater number of them a flow as smooth as oil . A few I retain , and will , in compliment to my own judgment . He thinks me too faithful to compound epithets in the introductory lines , and I know his reason . He fears lest the English reader should blame Homer , whom he idolizes , though hardly more than I , for such constant repetition . But them I shall not alter . They are necessary to a just representation of the original . In the affair of Outis ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 689 ]</span>I shall throw him flat on his back by an unanswerable argument , which I shall give in a note , and with which I am furnished by Mrs. Unwin . So much for hypercriticism , which has run away with all my paper . This critic , by the way , is ——;<span type="note_anchor">[ 690 ]</span>I know him by infallible indications .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— My eyes , which have long been inflamed , will hardly serve for Homer , and oblige me to make all my letters short . You have obliged me much , by sending me so speedily the remainder of your notes . I have begun with them again , and find them , as before , very much to the purpose . More to the purpose they could not have been , had you been poetry professor already . I rejoice sincerely in the prospect you have of that office , which , whatever may be your own thoughts of the matter , I am sure you will fill with great sufficiency . Would that my interest and power to serve you were greater ! One string to my bow I have , and one only , which shall not be idle for want of my exertions . I thank you likewise for your very entertaining notices and remarks in the natural way . The hurry in which I write would not suffer me to send you many in return , had I many to send , but only two or three present themselves .</p>
   <p>Frogs will feed on worms . I saw a frog gathering into his gullet an earth-worm as long as himself ; it cost him time and labour , but at last he succeeded .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin and I , crossing a brook , saw from the foot-bridge somewhat at the bottom of the water which had the appearance of a flower . Observing it attentively , we found that it consisted of a circular assemblage of minnows ; their heads all met in a centre , and their tails , diverging at equal distances , and being elevated above their heads , gave them the appearance of a flower half blown . One was longer than the rest , and as often as a straggler came in sight , he quitted his place to pursue him , and having driven him away , he returned to it again , and no other minnow offering to take it in his absence . This we saw him do several times . The object that had attached them all was a dead minnow , which they seemed to be devouring .</p>
   <p>After a very rainy day , I saw on one of the flower borders what seemed a long hair , but it had a waving , twining motion . Considering more nearly , I found it alive , and endued with spontaneity , but could not discover at the ends of it either head or tail , or any distinction of parts . I carried it into the house , when the air of a warm room dried and killed it presently .</p>

   <p>Your letter ( so full of kindness and so exactly in unison with my own feelings for you ) should have had , as it deserved to have , an earlier answer , had I not been perpetually tortured with inflamed eyes , which are a sad hindrance to me in everything . But , to make amends , if I do not send you an early answer , I send you at least a speedy one , being obliged to write as fast as my pen can trot , that I may shorten the time of poring upon paper as much as possible . Homer too has been another hindrance , for always when I can see , which is only about two hours every morning , and not at all by candle-light , I devote myself to him , being in haste to send him a second time to the press , that nothing may stand in the way of Milton . By the way , where are my dear Tom 's remarks , which I long to have , and must have soon , or they will come too late ?</p>
   <p>Oh , you rogue ! what would you give to have such a dream about Milton as I had about a week since ? I dreamed that , being in a house in the city , and with much company , looking towards the lower end of the room from the upper end of it , I descried a figure which I immediately knew to be Milton 's . He was very gravely but very neatly attired in the fashion of his day , and had a countenance which filled me with those feelings that an affectionate child has for a beloved father ,— such , for instance , as Tom has for you . My first thought was wonder , where he could have been concealed so many years ; my second , a transport of joy to find him still alive ; my third , another transport to find myself in his company ; and my fourth , a resolution to accost him . I did so , and he received me with a complacence in which I saw equal sweetness and dignity . I spoke of his Paradise Lost as every man must who is worthy to speak of it at all , and told him a long story of the manner in which it affected me when I first discovered it , being at that time a school-boy . He answered me by a smile , and a gentle inclination of his head . He then grasped my hand affectionately , and with a smile that charmed me , said , “ Well , you for your part will do well also ; ” at last , recollecting his great age ( for I understood him to be two hundred years old ) I feared that I might fatigue him by much talking , I took my leave , and he took his with an air of the most perfect good-breeding . His person , his features , his manner , were all so perfectly characteristic , that I am persuaded an apparition of him could not represent him more completely . This may be said to have been one of the dreams of Pindus , may it not ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 691 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 691 ]</span>Whether this is a poetical or real dream of Cowper 's , we presume not to decide . It bears so strong a resemblance to Milton 's vision of the Bishop of Winchester , ( the celebrated Dr. Andrews ,) as to suggest the probability of having been borrowed from that source . The passage is to be found in Milton 's beautiful Latin elegy on the death of that prelate , and is thus translated by Cowper :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ While I that splendour , and the mingled shade</l>
     <l n="2">Of fruitful vines with wonder fixt survey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="3">At once , with looks , that beam 'd celestial grace ,</l>
     <l n="4">The seer of Winton stood before my face .</l>
     <l n="5">His snowy vesture 's hem descending low</l>
     <l n="6">His golden sandals swept , and pure as snow</l>
     <l n="7">New-fallen shone the mitre on his brow .</l>
     <l n="8">Where'er he trod a tremulous sweet sound</l>
     <l n="9">Of gladness shook the flow'ry scene around :</l>
     <l n="10">Attendant angels clap their starry wings ,</l>
     <l n="11">The trumpet shakes the sky , all æther rings ,</l>
     <l n="12">Each chaunts his welcome , ...</l>
     <l n="13">Then night retired , and , chas 'd by dawning day ,</l>
     <l n="14">The visionary bliss pass 'd all away :</l>
     <l n="15">I mourn 'd my banish 'd sleep with fond concern ,</l>
     <l n="16">Frequent to me may dreams like this return . ”</l>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— Since I received your last I have been much indisposed , very blind , and very busy . But I have not suffered all these evils at one and the same time . While the winter lasted I was miserable with a fever on my spirits ; when the spring began to approach I was seized with an inflammation in my eyes , and ever since I have been able to use them , have been employed in giving more last touches to Homer , who is on the point of going to the press again .</p>
   <p>Though you are Tory , I believe , and I am Whig , our sentiments concerning the madcaps of France are much the same . They are a terrible race , and I have a horror both of them and their principles .<span type="note_anchor">[ 692 ]</span>Tacitus is certainly living now , and the quotations you sent me can be nothing but extracts from some letters of his to yourself .</p>

   <p>My dear little Critic ,— I thank you heartily for your observations , on which I set a higher value , because they have instructed me as much , and have entertained me more , than all the other strictures of our public judges in these matters . Perhaps I am not much more pleased with shameless wolf , &amp; c ., than you . But what is to be done , my little man ? Coarse as the expressions are , they are no more than equivalent to those of Homer . The invective of the ancients was never tempered with good manners , as your papa can tell you ; and my business , you know , is not to be more polite than my author , but to represent him as closely as I can .</p>
   <p>Dishonour 'd foul I have wiped away , for the reason you give , which is a very just one , and the present reading is this ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Who had dared dishonour thus</l>
     <l n="2">The life itself , &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Your objection to kindler of the fires of heaven I had the good fortune to anticipate , and expunged the dirty ambiguity some time since , wondering not a little that I had ever admitted it .</p>
   <p>The fault you find with the two first verses of Nestor 's speech discovers such a degree of just discernment that , but for your papa 's assurance to the contrary , I must have suspected him as the author of that remark : much as I should have respected it , if it had been so , I value it , I assure you , my little friend , still more as yours . In the new edition the passage will be found thus altered :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Alas ! great sorrow falls on Greece to-day !</l>
     <l n="2">Priam , and Priam 's sons , with all in Troy —</l>
     <l n="3">Oh ! how will they exult , and in their hearts</l>
     <l n="4">Triumph , once hearing of this broil between</l>
     <l n="5">The prime of Greece , in council and in arms !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Where the word reel suggests to you the idea of a drunken mountain , it performs the service to which I destined it . It is a bold metaphor ; but justified by one of the sublimest passages in scripture , compared with the sublimity of which even that of Homer suffers humiliation .</p>
   <p>It is God himself who , speaking , I think , by the prophet Isaiah , says ,</p>
   <p>“ The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard . "[ 693 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 693 ]</span>Isaiah xxiv . 20 .</p>
   <p>With equal boldness in the same scripture , the poetry of which was never equalled , mountains are said to skip , to break out into singing , and the fields to clap their hands . I intend , therefore , that my Olympus shall be still tipsy .</p>
   <p>The accuracy of your last remark , in which you convicted me of a bull , delights me . A fig for all critics but you ! The blockheads could not find it . It shall stand thus :—</p>
   <p>First spake Polydamus ——</p>
   <p>Homer was more upon his guard than to commit such a blunder , for he says ,</p>
   <p>ηρχ ’ αγορευειν .</p>
   <p>And now , my dear little censor , once more accept my thanks . I only regret that your strictures are so few , being just and sensible as they are .</p>
   <p>Tell your papa that he shall hear from me soon . Accept mine and my dear invalid 's affectionate remembrances .</p>
   <p>Ever yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Hayley ,— I am so busy every morning before breakfast ( my only opportunity ) , strutting and stalking in Homeric stilts , that you ought to account it an instance of marvellous grace and favour , that I condescend to write even to you . Sometimes I am seriously almost crazed with the multiplicity of the matters before me , and the little or no time that I have for them ; and sometimes I repose myself , after the fatigue of that distraction , on the pillow of despair : a pillow which has often served me in the time of need , and is become , by frequent use , if not very comfortable , at least convenient . So reposed , I laugh at the world , and say , “ Yes , you may gape and expect both Homer and Milton from me , but I 'll be hanged if ever you get them . ”</p>
   <p>In Homer you must know I am advanced as far as the fifteenth book of the Iliad , leaving nothing behind me that can reasonably offend the most fastidious : and I design him for public appearance in his new dress as soon as possible , for a reason which any poet may guess , if he will but thrust his hand into his pocket .</p>
   <p>You forbid me to tantalize you with an invitation to Weston , and yet you invite me to Eartham ! No ! no ! there is no such happiness in store for me at present . Had I rambled at all , I was under promise to all my dear mother 's kindred to go to Norfolk , and they are dying to see me ; but I have told them that die they must , for I cannot go ; and ergo , as you will perceive , can go nowhere else .</p>
   <p>Thanks for Mazarin 's epitaph !<span type="note_anchor">[ 694 ]</span>It is full of witty paradox , and is written with a force and severity which sufficiently bespeak the author . I account it an inestimable curiosity , and shall be happy when time shall serve , with your aid , to make a good translation of it . But that will be a stubborn business . Adieu ! The clock striks eight : and now for Homer .</p>

   <p>Cardinal Mazarin was minister of state to Louis XIII . and during the minority of Louis XIV . The last moments of this great statesman are too edifying not to be recorded . To the ecclesiastic ( Joly ) who attended him , he said , “ I am not satisfied with my state ; I wish to feel a more profound sorrow for my sins . I am a great sinner . I have no hope but in the mercy of God . ” ( Je suis un grand criminel , je n'ai d'esperance qu'en la misericorde divine . ) At another time he besought his confessor to treat him like the lowest subject in the realm , being convinced , he said , that there was but one gospel for the great , as well as for the little . ( Qu'il n'y avait qu'un Evangile pour les grands , et pour les petits . ) His sufferings were very acute . “ You see , ” he observed to those around him , “ what infirmities and wretchedness the fortunes and dignities of this world come to . ” He repeated many times the Miserere , ( Ps . li . ) stretching forth his hands , then clasping them , and lifting up his eyes to heaven , with all the marks of the most sincere devotion .</p>
   <p>At midnight he exclaimed , “ I am dying — my mind grows indistinct . I trust in Jesus Christ . ” ( Je vais bientôt mourir , mon jugement se trouble , j'espère en Jésus Christ . ) Afterwards , frequently repeating the sacred name of Jesus , he expired . ( Se mettant en devoir de répéter aussi fréquemment le très-saint nom de Jésus , il expira . )</p>

     <l n="1">Weston , March 27 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— I must send you a line of congratulation on the event of your transaction with Johnson , since you , I know , partake with me in the pleasure I receive from it . Few of my concerns have been so happily concluded . I am now satisfied with my bookseller , as I have substantial cause to be , and account myself in good hands ; a circumstance as pleasant to me as any other part of my business ; for I love dearly to be able to confide , with all my heart , in those with whom I am connected , of what kind soever the connexion may be .</p>
   <p>The question of printing or not printing the alterations seems difficult to decide . If they are not printed , I shall perhaps disoblige some purchasers of the first edition , and if they are , many others of them , perhaps a great majority will never care about them . As far as I have gone , I have made a fair copy ; and when I have finished the whole , will send them to Johnson , together with the interleaved volumes . He will see in a few minutes what it will be best to do , and by his judgment I shall be determined . The opinion to which I most incline is , that they ought to be printed separately , for they are many of them rather long , here and there a whole speech , or a whole simile , and the verbal and lineal variations are so numerous , that altogether , I apprehend , they will give a new air to the work , and I hope a much improved one .</p>
   <p>I forgot to say in the proper place , that some notes , although but very few , I have added already ; and may perhaps see here and there opportunity for a few more . But , notes being little wanted , especially by people at all conversant with classical literature , as most readers of Homer are , I am persuaded that were they numerous , they would be deemed an incumbrance . I shall write to Johnson soon , perhaps to-morrow , and then shall say the same thing to him .</p>
   <p>In point of health , we continue much the same . Our united love , and many thanks for your prosperous negotiations , attend yourself and whole family , and especially my little namesake . Adieu !</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— Your tidings concerning the slender pittance yet to come are , as you observe , of the melancholy cast . Not being gifted by nature with the means of acquiring much , it is well , however , that she has given me a disposition to be contented with little . I have now been so many years habituated to small matters , that I should probably find myself incommoded by greater ; and may I but be enabled to shift , as I have been hitherto , unsatisfied wishes will never trouble me much . My pen has helped me somewhat ; and , after some years ’ toil , I begin to reap the benefit . Had I begun sooner , perhaps I should have known fewer pecuniary distresses ; or , who can say ?— it is possible that I might not have succeeded so well . Fruit ripens only a short time before it rots ; and man , in general , arrives not at maturity of mental powers at a much earlier period . I am now busied in preparing Homer for his second appearance . An author should consider himself as bound not to please himself , but the public ; and as far as the good pleasure of the public may be learned from the critics , I design to accommodate myself to it . The Latinisms , though employed by Milton , and numbered by Addison among the arts and expedients by which he has given dignity to his style , I shall render into plain English ; the rougher lines , though my reason for using them has never been proved a bad one , so far as I know , I shall make perfectly smooth ; and shall give body and substance to all that is in any degree feeble and flimsy . And when I have done all this , and more , if the critics still grumble , I shall say the very deuce is in them . Yet , that they will grumble , I make no doubt ; for , unreasonable as it is to do so , they all require something better than Homer , and that something they will certainly never get from me .</p>
   <p>As to the canal that is to be my neighbour , I hear little about it . The Courtenays of Weston have nothing to do with it , and I have no intercourse with Tyringham . When it is finished , the people of these parts will have to carry their coals seven miles only , which now they bring from Northampton or Bedford , both at the distance of fifteen . But , as Balaam says , who shall live when these things are done ? It is not for me , a sexagenarian already , to expect that I shall . The chief objection to canals in general seems to be , that , multiplying as they do , they are likely to swallow the coasting trade .</p>
   <p>I cannot tell you the joy I feel at the disappointment of the French : pitiful mimics of Spartan and Roman virtue , without a grain of it in their whole character .</p>

   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— The long muster-roll of my great and small ancestors I signed and dated , and sent up to Mr. Blue-mantle , on Monday , according to your desire . Such a pompous affair , drawn out for my sake , reminds me of the old fable of the mountain in parturition , and a mouse the produce . Rest undisturbed , say I , their lordly , ducal , and royal dust ! Had they left me something handsome , I should have respected them more . But perhaps they did not know that such a one as I should have the honour to be numbered among their descendants .<span type="note_anchor">[ 696 ]</span>Well ! I have a little bookseller that makes me some amends for their deficiency . He has made me a present ; an act of liberality which I take every opportunity to blazon , as it well deserves . But you , I suppose , have learned it already from Mr. Rose .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 696 ]</span>Cowper , according to his kinsman , was descended , by the maternal line , through the families of Hippesley of Throughley , in Sussex , and Pellet , of Bolney , in the same county , from the several noble houses of West , Knollys , Carey , Bullen , Howard , and Mowbray ; and so by four different lines from Henry the Third , king of England . He justly adds , “ Distinction of this nature can shed no additional lustre on the memory of Cowper ; but genius , however exalted , disdains not , while it boasts not , the splendour of ancestry ; and royalty itself may be flattered , and perhaps benefited , by discovering its kindred to such piety , such purity , such talents as his . ” — See Sketch of the Life of Cowper , by Dr. Johnson .</p>
   <p>Fear not , my man . You will acquit yourself very well , I dare say , both in standing for your degree , and when you have gained it . A little tremor and a little shame-facedness in a stripling like you , are recommendations rather than otherwise ; and so they ought to be , being symptoms of an ingenuous mind , rather unfrequent in this age of brass .</p>
   <p>What you say of your determined purpose , with God 's help , to take up the cross and despise the shame , gives us both real pleasure . In our pedigree is found one , at least , who did it before you .<span type="note_anchor">[ 697 ]</span>Do you the like ; and you will meet him in heaven , as sure as the scripture is the word of God .<span type="note_anchor">[ 698 ]</span></p>

   <p>My dear Friend and Brother ,— Better late than never , and better a little than none at all ! Had I been at liberty to consult my inclinations , I would have answered your truly kind and affectionate letter immediately . But I am the busiest man alive , and , when this epistle is despatched , you will be the only one of my correspondents to whom I shall not be indebted . While I write this , my poor Mary sits mute ; which I cannot well bear , and which , together with want of time to write much , will have a curtailing effect on my epistle .</p>
   <p>My only studying time is still given to Homer , not to correction and amendment of him ( for that is all over ) but to writing notes . Johnson has expressed a wish for some , that the unlearned may be a little illuminated concerning classical story and the mythology of the ancients ; and his behaviour to me has been so liberal , that I can refuse him nothing . Poking into the old Greek commentators blinds me . But it is no matter . I am the more like Homer .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— Had it not been stipulated between us that , being both at present pretty much engrossed by business , we should write when opportunity offers , I should be frighted at the date of your last : but you will not judge me , I know , by the unfrequency of my letters ; nor suppose that my thoughts about you are equally unfrequent . In truth , they are not . No day passes in which you are excluded from them . I am so busy that I do not expect even now to fill my paper . While I write , my poor invalid , who is still unable to amuse herself either with book or needle , sits silent at my side ; which makes me , in all my letters , hasten to a conclusion . My only time for study is now before breakfast ; and I lengthen it as much as I can , by rising early .</p>
   <p>I know not that , with respect to our health , we are either better or worse than when you saw us . Mrs. Unwin , perhaps , has gained a little strength ; and the advancing spring , I hope , will add to it . As to myself , I am , in body , soul , and spirit , semper idem . Prayer , I know , is made for me , and sometimes with great enlargement of heart , by those who offer it : and in this circumstance consists the only evidence I can find , that God is still favourably mindful of me , and has not cast me off for ever .</p>
   <p>A long time since , I received a parcel from Dr. Cogshall , of New York ; and , looking on the reverse of the packing-paper , saw there an address to you . I conclude , therefore , that you received it first , and at his desire transmitted it to me ; consequently you are acquainted with him , and , probably , apprised of the nature of our correspondence . About three years ago I had his first letter to me , which came accompanied by half a dozen American publications . He proposed an exchange of books on religious subjects , as likely to be useful on both sides of the water . Most of those he sent , however , I had seen before . I sent him , in return , such as I could get ; but felt myself indifferently qualified for such a negotiation . I am now called upon to contribute my quota again ; and shall be obliged to you if , in your next , you will mention the titles of half a dozen that may be procured at little cost , that are likely to be new in that country , and useful .</p>
   <p>About two months since , I had a letter from Mr. Jeremiah Waring , of Alton in Hampshire . Do you know such a man ? I think I have seen his name in advertisements of mathematical works . He is , however , or seems to be , a very pious man .</p>
   <p>I was a little surprised lately , seeing in the last Gentleman 's Magazine a letter from somebody at Winchester , in which is a copy of the epitaph of our poor friend Unwin : an English , not a Latin one . It has been pleasant to me sometimes to think , that his dust lay under an inscription of my writing ; which I had no reason to doubt , because the Latin one , which I composed at the request of the executors , was , as I understood from Mr. H. Thornton , accepted by them and approved . If they thought , after all , that an English one , as more intelligible , would therefore be preferable , I believe they judged wisely ; but , having never heard that they had changed their mind about it , I was at a loss to account for the alteration .</p>
   <p>So now , my dear friend , adieu !— When I have thanked you for a barrel of oysters , and added our united kind remembrances to yourself and Miss Catlett , I shall have exhausted the last moment that I can spare at present .</p>
   <p>I remain sincerely yours , W. C .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— While your sorrow for our common loss was fresh in your mind , I would not write , lest a letter on so distressing a subject should be too painful both to you and me ; and now that I seem to have reached a proper time for doing it , the multiplicity of my literary business will hardly afford me leisure . Both you and I have this comfort when deprived of those we love — at our time of life we have every reason to believe that the deprivation cannot be long . Our sun is setting too , and when the hour of rest arrives we shall rejoin your brother , and many whom we have tenderly loved , our forerunners into a better country .</p>
   <p>I will say no more on a theme which it will be better perhaps to treat with brevity ; and because the introduction of any other might seem a transition too violent , I will only add that Mrs. Unwin and I are about as well as we at any time have been within the last year .</p>
   <p>Truly yours , W. C .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— My delay to answer your last kind letter , to which likewise you desired a speedy reply , must have seemed rather difficult to explain on any other supposition than that of illness ; but illness has not been the cause , although , to say the truth , I cannot boast of having been lately very well . Yet has not this been the cause of my silence , but your own advice , very proper and earnestly given to me , to proceed in the revisal of Homer . To this it is owing , that , instead of giving an hour or two before breakfast to my correspondents , I allot that time entirely to my studies . I have nearly given the last touches to the poetry , and am now busied far more laboriously in writing notes at the request of my honest bookseller , transmitted to me in the first instance by you , and afterward repeated by himself . I am , therefore , deep in the old Scholia , and have advanced to the latter part of Iliad nine , explaining , as I go , such passages as may be difficult to unlearned readers , and such only ; for notes of that kind are the notes that Johnson desired . I find it a more laborious task than the translation was , and shall be heartily glad when it is over . In the meantime , all the letters I receive remain unanswered , or , if they receive an answer , it is always a short one . Such this must be . Johnny is here , having flown over London .</p>
   <p>Homer , I believe , will make a much more respectable appearance than before . Johnson now thinks it will be right to make a separate impression of the amendments .</p>
   <p>W. C .</p>
   <p>I breakfast every morning on seven or eight pages of the Greek commentators . For so much I am obliged to read in order to select perhaps three or four short notes for the readers of my translation .</p>
   <p>Homer is indeed a tie upon me , that must not on any account be broken , till all his demands are satisfied ; though I have fancied , while the revisal of the Odyssey was at a distance , that it would ask less labour in the finishing , it is not unlikely , that , when I take it actually in hand , I may find myself mistaken . Of this at least I am sure , that uneven verse abounds much more in it than it once did in the Iliad ; yet to the latter the critics objected on that account , though to the former never ; perhaps because they had not read it . Hereafter they shall not quarrel with me on that score . The Iliad is now all smooth turnpike , and I will take equal care , that there shall be no jolts in the Odyssey .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Coz ,— You have thought me long silent , and so have many others . In fact I have not for many months written punctually to any but yourself and Hayley . My time , the little I have , is so engrossed by Homer , that I have at this moment a bundle of unanswered letters by me , and letters likely to be so . Thou knowest , I dare say , what it is to have a head weary with thinking . Mine is so fatigued by breakfast time , three days out of four , I am utterly incapable of sitting down to my desk again for any purpose whatever .</p>
   <p>I am glad I have convinced thee at last that thou art a Tory . Your friend 's definition of Whig and Tory must be just , for aught I know , as far as the latter are concerned ; but respecting the former , I think him mistaken . There is no TRUE Whig who wishes all power in the hands of his own party . The division of it which the lawyers call tripartite is exactly what he desires ; and he would have neither king , lords , nor commons unequally trusted , or in the smallest degree predominant . Such a Whig am I , and such Whigs are the true friends of the constitution .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! my dear ; I am dead with weariness .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— It has not been without frequent self-reproach that I have so long omitted to answer your last very kind and most obliging letter . I am by habit and inclination extremely punctual in the discharge of such arrears , and it is only through necessity , and under constraint of various indispensable engagements of a different kind , that I am become of late much otherwise .</p>
   <p>I have never seen Chapman 's translation of Homer , and will not refuse your offer of it , unless , by accepting it , I shall deprive you of a curiosity that you cannot easily replace .<span type="note_anchor">[ 700 ]</span>The line or two which you quote from him , except that the expression “ a well-written soul ” has the quaintness of his times in it , do him credit . He cannot surely be the same Chapman who wrote a poem , I think , on the battle of Hochstadt , in which , when I was a very young man , I remember to have seen the following lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Think of two thousand gentlemen at least ,</l>
     <l n="2">And each man mounted on his capering beast .</l>
     <l n="3">Into the Danube they were push 'd by shoals , ” &amp; c .</l>
   </lg>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 700 ]</span>Chapman claims the honour of being the first translator of the whole of the works of Homer . He was born in 1557 , and was the contemporary of Shakspeare , Spenser , Jonson , &amp; c. His version of the Iliad was dedicated to Henry , Prince of Wales . He also translated Musæus and Hesiod , and was the author of many other works . He died in 1634 , aged seventy-seven . His version of Homer is now obsolete , and rendered tedious by the protracted measure of fourteen syllables ; though occasionally it exhibits much spirit . Waller , according to Dryden , could never read his version without emotion , and Pope found it worthy of his particular attention .</p>
   <p>These are lines that could not fail to impress the memory , though not altogether in the Homerican style of battle .</p>
   <p>I am , as you say , a hermit , and probably an irreclaimable one , having a horror of London that I cannot express , nor indeed very easily account for . Neither am I much less disinclined to migration in general . I did no little violence to my love of home last summer , when I paid Mr. Hayley a visit , and in truth was principally induced to the journey by a hope that it might be useful to Mrs. Unwin ; who , however , derived so little benefit from it , that I purpose for the future to avail myself of the privilege my years may reasonably claim , by compelling my younger friends to visit me . But even this is a point which I cannot well compass at present , both because I am too busy , and because poor Mrs. Unwin is not able to bear the fatigue of company . Should better days arrive , days of more leisure to me , and of some health to her , I shall not fail to give you notice of the change , and shall then hope for the pleasure of seeing you at Weston .</p>
   <p>The epitaph you saw is on the tomb of the same Mr. Unwin to whom the “ Tirocinium ” is inscribed ; the son of the lady above mentioned . By the desire of his executors I wrote a Latin one , which they approved , but it was not approved by a relation of the deceased , and therefore was not used . He objected to the mention I had made in it of his mother having devoted him to the service of God in his infancy . She did it , however , and not in vain , as I wrote in my epitaph . Who wrote the English one I know not .</p>
   <p>The poem called the “ Slave ” is not mine , nor have I ever seen it . I wrote two on the subject — one entitled “ The Negro 's Complaint , ” and the other “ The Morning Dream . ” With thanks for all your kindness , and the patience you have with me ,</p>
   <p>I remain , dear sir , Sincerely yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Brother ,— You must either think me extremely idle , or extremely busy , that I have made your last very kind letter wait so very long for an answer . The truth however is , that I am neither ; but have had time enough to have scribbled to you , had I been able to scribble at all . To explain this riddle I must give you a short account of my proceedings .</p>
   <p>I rise at six every morning and fag till near eleven , when I breakfast . The consequence is , that I am so exhausted as not to be able to write , when the opportunity offers . You will say — “ Breakfast before you work , and then your work will not fatigue you . ” I answer — “ Perhaps I might , and your counsel would probably prove beneficial ; but I cannot spare a moment for eating in the early part of the morning , having no other time for study . ” This uneasiness of which I complain is a proof that I am somewhat stricken in years ; and there is no other cause by which I can account for it , since I go early to bed , always between ten and eleven , and seldom fail to sleep well . Certain it is , ten years ago I could have done as much , and sixteen years ago did actually much more , without suffering fatigue or any inconvenience from my labours . How insensibly old age steals on , and how often is it actually arrived before we suspect it ! Accident alone , some occurrence that suggests a comparison of our former with our present selves , affords the discovery . Well ! it is always good to be undeceived , especially on an article of such importance .</p>
   <p>There has been a book lately published , entitled , “ Man as he is . ” I have heard a high character of it , as admirably written , and am informed , that for that reason , and because it inculcates Whig principles , it is by many imputed to you . I contradict this report , assuring my informant , that had it been yours , I must have known it , for that you have bound yourself to make me your father-confessor on all such wicked occasions , and not to conceal from me even a murder , should you happen to commit one .<span type="note_anchor">[ 701 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 701 ]</span>The real author was Robert Bage .</p>
   <p>I will not trouble you , at present , to send me any more books with a view to my notes on Homer . I am not without hopes that Sir John Throckmorton , who is expected here from Venice in a short time , may bring me Villoison 's edition of the Odyssey . He certainly will , if he found it published , and that alone will be instar omnium .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dearest brother ! Give my love to Tom , and thank him for his book , of which I believe I need not have deprived him , intending that my readers shall detect the occult instruction contained in Homer 's stories for themselves .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— I seize a passing moment merely to say that I feel for your distresses , and sincerely pity you , and I shall be happy to learn from your next , that your sister 's amendment has superseded the necessity you feared of a journey to London . Your candid account of the effect that your afflictions have both on your spirits and temper I can perfectly understand , having laboured much in that fire myself , and perhaps more than any man . It is in such a school , however , that we must learn , if we ever truly learn it , the natural depravity of the human heart , and of our own in particular ; together with the consequence that necessarily follows such wretched premises ; our indispensable need of the atonement , and our inexpressible obligations to Him who made it . This reflection cannot escape a thinking mind , looking back on those ebullitions of fretfulness and impatience to which it has yielded in a season of great affliction .</p>
   <p>Having lately had company , who left us only on the 4th , I have done nothing — nothing indeed , since my return from Sussex , except a trifle or two , which it was incumbent upon me to write . Milton hangs in doubt : neither spirits nor opportunity suffice me for that labour . I regret continually that I ever suffered myself to be persuaded to undertake it . The most that I hope to effect is a complete revisal of my own Homer . Johnson told my friend , who has just left me , that it will begin to be reviewed in the next Analytical , and he hoped the review of it would not offend me . By this I understand , that if I am not offended it will be owing more to my own equanimity than to the mildness of the critic . So be it ! He will put an opportunity of victory over myself into my hands , and I will endeavour not to lose it .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— You promise to be contented with a short line , and a short one you must have , hurried over in the little interval I have happened to find between the conclusion of my morning task and breakfast . Study has this good effect , at least ; it makes me an early riser , who might otherwise , perhaps , be as much given to dozing as my readers .</p>
   <p>The scanty opportunity I have , I shall employ in telling you what you principally wish to be told — the present state of mine and Mrs. Unwin 's health . In her I cannot perceive any alteration for the better ; and must be satisfied , I believe , as indeed I have great reason to be , if she does not alter for the worse . She uses the orchard-walk daily , but always supported between two , and is still unable to employ herself as formerly . But she is cheerful , seldom in much pain , and has always strong confidence in the mercy and faithfulness of God .</p>
   <p>As to myself , I have always the same song to sing — Well in body but sick in spirit : sick , nigh unto death .</p>

   <p>What remains for me to say on this subject , my dear brother bard , I will say in prose . There are other impediments which I could not compromise within the bounds of a sonnet .</p>
   <p>My poor Mary 's infirm condition makes it impossible for me , at present , to engage in a work such as you propose . My thoughts are not sufficiently free , nor have I , or can I , by any means , find opportunity ; added to it comes a difficulty which , though you are not at all aware of it , presents itself to me under a most forbidding appearance . Can you guess it ? No , not you ; neither perhaps will you be able to imagine that such a difficulty can possibly subsist . If your hair begins to bristle , stroke it down again , for there is no need why it should erect itself . It concerns me , not you . I know myself too well not to know that I am nobody in verse , unless in a corner , and alone , and unconnected in my operations . This is not owing to want of love for you , my brother , or the most consummate confidence in you ; for I have both in a degree that has not been exceeded in the experience of any friend you have , or ever had . But I am so made up — I will not enter into a metaphysical analysis of my strange composition , in order to detect the true cause of this evil ; but on a general view of the matter , I suspect that it proceeds from that shyness which has been my effectual and almost fatal hindrance on many other important occasions , and which I should feel , I well know , on this , to a degree that would perfectly cripple me . No ! I shall neither do , nor attempt any thing of consequence more , unless my poor Mary get better ; nor even then , unless it should please God to give me another nature , in concert with any man — I could not , even with my own father or brother , were they now alive . Small game must serve me at present , and , till I have done with Homer and Milton , a sonnet , or some such matter , must content me . The utmost that I aspire to , and Heaven knows with how feeble a hope , is to write at some better opportunity , and when my hands are free , “ The Four Ages . ” Thus I have opened my heart unto thee .<span type="note_anchor">[ 706 ]</span></p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 706 ]</span>What the proposed literary partnership was , which Hayley suggested , we know not ; it is evident that it was not the poem of “ The Four Ages , ” which forms the subject of the following letter , and in which Cowper acquiesced .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO WILLIAM HAYLEY , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , July 7 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Hayley ,— If the excessive heat of this day , which forbids me to do any thing else , will permit me to scribble to you , I shall rejoice . To do this is a pleasure to me at all times , but to do it now , a double one ; because I am in haste to tell you how much I am delighted with your projected quadruple alliance , and to assure you , that if it please God to afford me health , spirits , ability , and leisure , I will not fail to devote them all to the production of my quota of “ The Four Ages . "[ 707 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 707 ]</span>Hayley made a second proposition to unite with Cowper in the projected poem of “ The Four Ages , ” and to engage the aid of two distinguished artists , who were to embellish the work with appropriate designs . We believe that Lawrence and Flaxman were the persons to whom Hayley refers . We cannot sufficiently regret the failure of this plan , which would have enriched literature and art with so happy a specimen of poetical and professional talent . But the period was unhappily approaching which was to suspend the fine powers of Cowper 's mind , and to shroud them in the veil of darkness .</p>
   <p>You are very kind to humour me as you do , and had need be a little touched yourself with all my oddities , that you may know how to administer to mine . All whom I love do so , and I believe it to be impossible to love heartily those who do not . People must not do me good in their way , but in my own , and then they do me good indeed . My pride , my ambition , and my friendship for you , and the interest I take in my own dear self , will all be consulted and gratified by an arm-in-arm appearance with you in public ; and I shall work with more zeal and assiduity at Homer , and , when Homer is finished , at Milton , with the prospect of such a coalition before me . But what shall I do with a multitude of small pieces , from which I intended to select the best , and adding them to “ The Four Ages , ” to have made a volume ? Will there be room for them upon your plan ? I have re-touched them , and will re-touch them again . Some of them will suggest pretty devices to a designer ; and in short , I have a desire not to lose them .</p>
   <p>I am at this moment , with all the imprudence natural to poets , expending nobody knows what , in embellishing my premises , or rather the premises of my neighbour Courtenay , which is more poetical still . I have built one summer-house already , with the boards of my old study , and am building another , spick and span , as they say . I have also a stone-cutter now at work , setting a bust of my dear old Grecian on a pedestal ; and besides all this , I meditate still more that is to be done in the autumn . Your project , therefore , is most opportune , as any project must needs be that has so direct a tendency to put money into the pocket of one so likely to want it .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ah brother poet ! send me of your shade ,</l>
     <l n="2">And bid the zephyrs hasten to my aid !</l>
     <l n="3">Or , like a worm unearth 'd at noon , I go ,</l>
     <l n="4">Despatch 'd by sunshine , to the shades below .</l>

    <head>It is due to the memory of my revered friend and brother-in-law , the Rev . Dr. Johnson , to state that Cowper was indebted to his ever-watchful and affectionate kindness for what he here calls his “ dear old Grecian . ” With that amiable solicitude which formed so prominent a feature in his character , and which was always seeking how to please and to confer a favour , he had contrived to procure an antique bust of Homer , to gratify Cowper 's partiality for his favourite bard . No present could possibly have been more acceptable or appropriate . We cannot avoid remarking , on this occasion , that , to anticipate a want and to supply it , to know how to minister to the gratification of another , and to enhance the gift by the grace of bestowing it , is one of the great arts of social and domestic life . It is not the amount , nor the intrinsic value of the favour , for the power of giving must in that case be restricted to the few . To give royally requires not only an enlarged heart , but ample and enlarged means . It is the appropriateness of the time and the occasion , the grace of the manner , and the unobtrusiveness of its character , that constitutes the value of the gift and endears the giver .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

    <head>TO THOMAS PARK , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">W. U ., July 15 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— Within these few days I have received , by favour of Miss Knapps , your acceptable present of Chapman 's translation of the Iliad . I know not whether the book be a rarity , but a curiosity it certainly is . I have as yet seen but little of it ; enough , however , to make me wonder that any man , with so little taste for Homer , or apprehension of his manner , should think it worth while to undertake the laborious task of translating him : the hope of pecuniary advantage may perhaps account for it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 708 ]</span>His information , I fear , was not much better than his verse , for I have consulted him in one passage of some difficulty , and find him giving a sense of his own , not at all warranted by the words of Homer . Pope sometimes does this , and sometimes omits the difficult part entirely . I can boast of having done neither , though it has cost me infinite pains to exempt myself from the necessity .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 708 ]</span>Chapman 's version is thus described by Warton : he “ frequently retrenches or impoverishes what he could not feel and express , ” and yet is “ not always without strength and spirit . ” By Anton , in his Philosophical Satires , published in 1616 , he is characterised as</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Greeke-thund'ring Chapman , beaten to the age ,</l>
     <l n="2">With a deepe furie and a sudden rage . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The testimony of Bishop Percy is flattering . “ Had Chapman , ” he observes , “ translated the Iliad in blank verse , it had been one of our chief classic performances . ”</p>
   <p>I have seen a translation by Hobbes , which I prefer for its greater clumsiness . Many years have passed since I saw it , but it made me laugh immoderately . Poetry that is not good can only make amends for that deficiency by being ridiculous ; and , because the translation of Hobbes has at least this recommendation , I shall be obliged to you , should it happen to fall in your way , if you would be so kind as to procure it for me . The only edition of it I ever saw ( and perhaps there never was another [ 709 ]) , was a very thick 12mo , both print and paper bad ; a sort of book that would be sought in vain , perhaps , anywhere but on a stall .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 709 ]</span>Cowper is mistaken in this supposition . Wood , in his</l>
     <l n="2">Athenæ , records an edition of the Iliad in 1675 ; and of the</l>
     <l n="3">Odyssey in 1667 , and there was a re-impression of both in 1686 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When you saw Lady Hesketh , you saw the relation of mine with whom I have been more intimate , even from childhood , than any other . She has seen much of the world , understands it well , and , having great natural vivacity , is of course one of the most agreeable companions .</p>
   <p>I have now arrived almost at a close of my labours on the Iliad , and have left nothing behind me , I believe , which I shall wish to alter on any future occasion . In about a fortnight or three weeks I shall begin to do the same for the Odyssey , and hope to be able to perform it while the Iliad is in printing . Then Milton will demand all my attention , and when I shall find opportunity either to revise your MSS ., or to write a poem of my own ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 710 ]</span>which I have in contemplation , I can hardly say . Certainly not till both these tasks are accomplished .</p>
   <p>I remain , dear sir , With many thanks for your kind present , Sincerely yours , W. C .</p>

    <head>TO MRS. CHARLOTTE SMITH .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , July 25 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Madam ,— Many reasons concurred to make me impatient for the arrival of your most acceptable present ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 711 ]</span>and among them was the fear lest you should perhaps suspect me of tardiness in acknowledging so great a favour ; a fear , that , as often as it prevailed , distressed me exceedingly . At length I have received it , and my little bookseller assures me , that he sent it the very day he got it ; by some mistake , however , the wagon brought it instead of the coach , which occasioned the delay .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 711 ]</span>The poem of the Emigrants , which was dedicated to Cowper .</p>
   <p>It came this morning , about an hour ago ; consequently I have not had time to peruse the poem , though you may be sure I have found enough for the perusal of the dedication . I have , in fact , given it three readings , and in each have found increasing pleasure .</p>
   <p>I am a whimsical creature : when I write for the public , I write of course with a desire to please ; in other words , to acquire fame , and I labour accordingly ; but when I find that I have succeeded , feel myself alarmed , and ready to shrink from the acquisition .</p>
   <p>This I have felt more than once ; and when I saw my name at the head of your dedication , I felt it again ; but the consummate delicacy of your praise soon convinced me that I might spare my blushes , and that the demand was less upon my modesty than my gratitude . Of that be assured , dear madam , and of the truest esteem and respect of your most obliged and affectionate humble servant ,</p>
   <p>W. C .</p>
   <p>P. S. I should have been much grieved to have let slip this opportunity of thanking you for your charming sonnets , and my two most agreeable old friends , Monimia and Orlando .<span type="note_anchor">[ 712 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 712 ]</span>Mrs. Charlotte Smith is well known as an authoress , and particularly for her beautiful sonnets . She was formerly a great eulogist of the French Revolution , but the horrors which distinguished that political era led to a change in her sentiments , which she publicly avowed in her “ Banished Man . ” There is a great plaintiveness of feeling in all her writings , arising from the unfortunate incidents of her chequered life . We remember this lady , with her family , formerly resident at Oxford , where she excited much interest by her talents and misfortunes .</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . MR. GREATHEED .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , July 27 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I was not without some expectation of a line from you , my dear sir , though you did not promise me one at your departure , and am happy not to have been disappointed ; still happier to learn that you and Mrs. Greatheed are well , and so delightfully situated . Your kind offer to us of sharing with you the house which you at present inhabit , added to the short , but lively , description of the scenery that surrounds it , wants nothing to win our acceptance , should it please God to give Mrs. Unwin a little more strength , and should I ever be master of my time so as to be able to gratify myself with what would please me most . But many have claims upon us , and some who cannot absolutely be said to have any would yet complain and think themselves slighted , should we prefer rocks and caves to them . In short , we are called so many ways , that these numerous demands are likely to operate as a remora , and to keep us fixed at home . Here we can occasionally have the pleasure of yours and Mrs. Greatheed 's company , and to have it here must I believe , content us . Hayley in his last letter gives me reason to expect the pleasure of seeing him and his dear boy Tom , in the autumn . He will use all his eloquence to draw us to Eartham again . My cousin Johnny , of Norfolk , holds me under promise to make my first trip thither , and the very same promise I have hastily made to visit Sir John and Lady Throckmorton , at Bucklands . How to reconcile such clashing promises , and give satisfaction to all , would puzzle me , had I nothing else to do ; and therefore , as I say , the result will probably be , that we shall find ourselves obliged to go nowhere , since we cannot everywhere .</p>
   <p>Wishing you both safe at home again , and to see you as soon as may be here ,</p>
   <p>I remain , Affectionately yours , W. C .</p>

    <head>TO WILLIAM HAYLEY , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , July 27 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have been vexed with myself , my dearest brother , and with every thing about me , not excepting even Homer himself , that I have been obliged so long to delay an answer to your last kind letter . If I listen any longer to calls another way , I shall hardly be able to tell you how happy we are in the hope of seeing you in the autumn , before the autumn will have arrived . Thrice welcome will you and your dear boy be to us , and the longer you will afford us your company , the more welcome . I have set up the head of Homer on a famous fine pedestal , and a very majestic appearance he makes . I am now puzzled about a motto , and wish you to decide for me between two , one of which I have composed myself , a Greek one , as follows ;</p>
   <p>Εικονατις ταυτην ; κλυτον ανερος ουνομ ’ ολωλεν . Ουνομα δ'ουτος ανηρ αφθιτον αιεν εχει .</p>
   <p>The other is my own translation of a passage in the Odyssey , the original of which I have seen used as a motto to an engraved head of Homer many a time .</p>
   <p>The present edition of the lines stands thus ,</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Him partially the muse</l>
     <l n="2">And dearly loved , yet gave him good and ill :</l>
     <l n="3">She quenched his sight , but gave him strains divine</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Tell me , by the way , ( if you ever had any speculations on the subject ,) what is it you suppose Homer to have meant in particular , when he ascribed his blindness to the muse , for that he speaks of himself under the name of Demodocus , in the eighth book , I believe is by all admitted . How could the old bard study himself blind , when books were either so few or none at all ? And did he write his poems ? If neither were the cause , as seems reasonable to imagine , how could he incur his blindness by such means as could be justly imputable to the muse ? Would mere thinking blind him ? I want to know :</p>
   <p>“ Call up some spirit from the vasty deep ! ”</p>
   <p>I said to my Sam<span type="note_anchor">[ 713 ]</span>——, “ Sam , build me a shed in the garden , with any thing that you can find , and make it rude and rough , like one of those at Eartham . ” —— “ Yes , Sir , ” says Sam , and straightway laying his own noddle , and the carpenter 's noddle together , has built me a thing fit for Stow Gardens . Is not this vexatious ?—— I threaten to inscribe it thus :</p>
   <lg>

   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— The bishop of Norwich has won my heart by his kind and liberal behaviour to you ; and , if I knew him , I would tell him so .</p>
   <p>I am glad that your auditors find your voice strong and your utterance distinct ; glad , too , that your doctrine has hitherto made you no enemies . You have a gracious Master , who , it seems , will not suffer you to see war in the beginning . It will be a wonder , however , if you do not , sooner or later , find out that sore place in every heart which can ill endure the touch of apostolic doctrine . Somebody will smart in his conscience , and you will hear of it . I say not this , my dear Johnny , to terrify , but to prepare you for that which is likely to happen , and which , troublesome as it may prove , is yet devoutly to be wished ; for , in general , there is little good done by preachers till the world begins to abuse them . But understand me aright . I do not mean that you should give them unnecessary provocation , by scolding and railing at them , as some , more zealous than wise , are apt to do . That were to deserve their anger . No ; there is no need of it . The self-abasing doctrines of the gospel will , of themselves , create you enemies ; but remember this , for your comfort — they will also , in due time , transform them into friends , and make them love you , as if they were your own children . God give you many such ; as , if you are faithful to his cause , I trust he will !</p>
   <p>Sir John and Lady Throckmorton have lately arrived in England , and are now at the Hall . They have brought me from Rome a set of engravings on Odyssey subjects , by Flaxman , whom you have heard Hayley celebrate . They are very fine , very much in the antique style , and a present from the Dowager Lady Spencer .</p>

   <p>My dearest Cousin ,— I am glad that my poor and hasty attempts to express some little civility to Miss Fanshaw and the amiable Count ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 715 ]</span>have your and her approbation . The lines addressed to her were not what I would have made them , but lack of time , a lack which always presses me , would not suffer me to improve them . Many thanks for her letter , which , were my merits less the subject of it , I should without scruple say is an excellent one . She writes with the force and accuracy of a person skilled in more languages than are spoken in the present day , as I doubt not that she is . I perfectly approve the theme she recommends to me , but am at present so totally absorbed in Homer , that all I do beside is ill done , being hurried over ; and I would not execute ill a subject of her recommending .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 715 ]</span>Count Gravina , the Spanish Admiral .</p>
   <p>I shall watch the walnuts with more attention than they who eat them , which I do in some hope , though you do not expressly say so , that when their threshing time arrives , we shall see you here . I am now going to paper my new study , and in a short time it will be fit to inhabit .</p>
   <p>Lady Spencer has sent me a present from Rome , by the hands of Sir John Throckmorton , engravings of Odyssey subjects , after figures by Flaxman ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 716 ]</span>a statuary at present resident there , of high repute , and much a friend of Hayley 's .</p>

   <p>Adieu , W. C .</p>
   <p>That the allusion in the former part of the letter may be understood , it is necessary to state , that Lady Hesketh had lent a manuscript poem of Cowper 's to her friend Miss Fanshaw , with an injunction that she should neither show it nor take a copy .

   <p>Besides , my dearest brother , they have not only built for me what I did not want , but have ruined a notable tetrastic by doing so . I had written one which I designed for a hermitage , and it will by no means suit the fine and pompous affair which they have made instead of one . So that , as a poet , I am every way afflicted ; made poorer than I need have been , and robbed of my verses : what case can be more deplorable ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 718 ]</span></p>

   <p>You must not suppose me ignorant of what Flaxman has done , or that I have not seen it , or that I am not actually in possession of it , at least of the engravings which you mention . In fact , I have had them more than a fortnight . Lady Dowager Spencer , to whom I inscribed my Odyssey , and who was at Rome when Sir John Throckmorton was there , charged him with them as a present to me , and arriving here lately he executed his commission . Romney , I doubt not , is right in his judgment of them ; he is an artist himself , and cannot easily be mistaken ; and I take his opinion as an oracle , the rather because it coincides exactly with my own . The figures are highly classical , antique , and elegant ; especially that of Penelope , who , whether she wakes or sleeps , must necessarily charm all beholders .</p>
   <p>Your scheme of embellishing my Odyssey with these plates is a kind one , and the fruit of your benevolence to me ; but Johnson , I fear , will hardly stake so much money as the cost would amount to , on a work , the fate of which is at present uncertain . Nor could we adorn the Odyssey in this splendid manner , unless we had similar ornaments to bestow on the Iliad . Such , I presume , are not ready , and much time must elapse even if Flaxman should accede to the plan , before he could possibly prepare them . Happy indeed should I be to see a work of mine so nobly accompanied , but , should that good fortune ever attend me , it cannot take place till the third or fourth edition shall afford the occasion . This I regret , and I regret too that you will have seen them before I can have an opportunity to show them to you . Here is sixpence for you if you will abstain from the sight of them while you are in London .</p>

   <p>My dearest Catharina is too reasonable , I know , to expect news from me , who live on the outside of the world , and know nothing that passes within it . The best news is , that , though you are gone , you are not gone for ever , as once I supposed you were , and said that we should probably meet no more . Some news however we have ; but then I conclude that you have already received it from the Doctor , and that thought almost deprives me of all courage to relate it . On the evening of the feast , Bob Archer 's house affording , I suppose , the best room for the purpose , all the lads and lasses who felt themselves disposed to dance , assembled there . Long time they danced , at least long time they did something a little like it , when at last the company having retired , the fiddler asked Bob for a lodging ; Bob replied — “ that his beds were all full of his own family , but if he chose it he would show him a hay-cock , where he might sleep as sound as in any bed whatever . ” — So forth they went together , and when they reached the place , the fiddler knocked down Bob , and demanded his money . But , happily for Bob , though he might be knocked down , and actually was so , yet he could not possibly be robbed , having nothing . The fiddler , therefore , having amused himself with kicking him and beating him , as he lay , as long as he saw good , left him , and has never been heard of since , nor inquired after indeed , being no doubt the last man in the world whom Bob wishes to see again .</p>
   <p>By a letter from Hayley , to-day , I learn , that Flaxman , to whom we are indebted for those Odyssey figures which Lady Frog brought over , has almost finished a set for the Iliad also . I should be glad to embellish my Homer with them , but neither my bookseller , nor I , shall probably choose to risk so expensive an ornament on a work , whose reception with the public is at present doubtful .</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dearest Catharina . Give my best love to your husband . Come home as soon as you can , and accept our united very best wishes .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— I rejoice that you have had so pleasant an excursion , and have beheld so many beautiful scenes . Except the delightful Upway , I have seen them all . I have lived much at Southampton , have slept and caught a sore throat at Lyndhurst , and have swum in the bay of Weymouth . It will give us great pleasure to see you here , should your business give you an opportunity to finish your excursions of this season with one to Weston .</p>
   <p>As for my going on , it is much as usual . I rise at six ; an industrious and wholesome practice from which I have never swerved since March . I breakfast generally about eleven — have given the intermediate time to my old delightful bard . Villoisson no longer keeps me company , I therefore now jog along with Clarke and Barnes at my elbow , and from the excellent annotations of the former , select such as I think likely to be useful , or that recommend themselves by the amusement they may afford ; of which sorts there are not a few . Barnes also affords me some of both kinds , but not so many , his notes being chiefly paraphrastical or grammatical . My only fear is , lest between them both I should make my work too voluminous .</p>

   <p>I thank you , my dear brother , for consulting the Gibbonian oracle on the question concerning Homer 's muse and his blindness . I proposed it likewise to my little neighbour Buchanan , who gave me precisely the same answer . I felt an insatiable thirst to learn something new concerning him , and , despairing of information from others , was willing to hope , that I had stumbled on matter unnoticed by the commentators , and might , perhaps , acquire a little intelligence from himself . But the great and the little oracle together have extinguished that hope , and I despair now of making any curious discoveries about him .</p>
   <p>Since Flaxman ( which I did not know till your letter told me so ) has been at work for the Iliad , as well as the Odyssey , it seems a great pity , that the engravings should not be bound up with some Homer or other ; and , as I said before , I should have been too proud to have bound them up in mine . But there is an objection , at least such it seems to me , that threatens to disqualify them for such a use , namely , the shape and size of them , which are such , that no book of the usual form could possibly receive them , save in a folded state , which , I apprehend , would be to murder them .</p>
   <p>The monument of Lord Mansfield , for which you say he is engaged , will ( I dare say ) prove a noble effort of genius .<span type="note_anchor">[ 720 ]</span>Statuaries , as I have heard an eminent one say , do not much trouble themselves about a likeness : else I would give much to be able to communicate to Flaxman the perfect idea that I have of the subject , such as he was forty years ago . He was at that time wonderfully handsome , and would expound the most mysterious intricacies of the law , or recapitulate both matter and evidence of a cause , as long as from hence to Eartham , with an intelligent smile on his features , that bespoke plainly the perfect ease with which he did it . The most abstruse studies ( I believe ) never cost him any labour .</p>

   <p>You say nothing lately of your intended journey our way : yet the year is waning , and the shorter days give you a hint to lose no time unnecessarily . Lately we had the whole family at the Hall , and now we have nobody . The Throckmortons are gone into Berkshire , and the Courtenays into Yorkshire . They are so pleasant a family , that I heartily wish you to see them ; and at the same time wish to see you before they return , which will not be sooner than October . How shall I reconcile these wishes seemingly opposite ? Why , by wishing that you may come soon and stay long . I know no other way of doing it .</p>
   <p>My poor Mary is much as usual . I have set up Homer 's head , and inscribed the pedestal ; my own Greek at the top , with your translation under it , and</p>

   <p>Your question , at what time your coming to us will be most agreeable , is a knotty one , and such as , had I the wisdom of Solomon , I should be puzzled to answer . I will therefore leave it still a question , and refer the time of your journey Weston-ward entirely to your own election : adding this one limitation , however , that I do not wish to see you exactly at present , on account of the unfinished state of my study , the wainscot of which still smells of paint , and which is not yet papered . But to return : as I have insinuated , thy pleasant company is the thing which I always wish , and as much at one time as at another . I believe , if I examine myself minutely , since I despair of ever having it in the height of summer , which for your sake I should desire most , the depth of the winter is the season which would be most eligible to me . For then it is , that in general I have most need of a cordial , and particularly in the month of January , I am sorry , however , that I departed so far from my first purpose , and am answering a question , which I declared myself unable to answer . Choose thy own time , secure of this , that , whatever time that be , it will always to us be a welcome one .</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . MR. JOHNSON .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , Sept. 4 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dearest Johnny ,— To do a kind thing , and in a kind manner , is a double kindness , and no man is more addicted to both than you , or more skilful in contriving them . Your plan to surprise me agreeably succeeded to admiration . It was only the day before yesterday , that , while we walked after dinner in the orchard , Mrs. Unwin between Sam and me , hearing the Hall clock , I observed a great difference between that and ours , and began immediately to lament , as I had often done , that there was not a sun-dial in all Weston to ascertain the true time for us . My complaint was long , and lasted till , having turned into the grass-walk , we reached the new building at the end of it ; where we sat awhile and reposed ourselves . In a few minutes we returned by the way we came , when what think you was my astonishment to see what I had not seen before , though I had passed close by it , a smart sun-dial mounted on a smart stone pedestal ! I assure you it seemed the effect of conjuration . I stopped short , and exclaimed — “ Why , here is a sun-dial , and upon our ground ! How is this ? Tell me , Sam , how it came here ? Do you know anything about it ? ” At first I really thought ( that is to say , as soon as I could think at all ) that this fac-totum of mine , Sam Roberts , having often heard me deplore the want of one , had given orders for the supply of that want himself , without my knowledge , and was half pleased and half offended . But he soon exculpated himself by imputing the fact to you . It was brought up to Weston ( it seems ) about noon : but Andrews stopped the cart at the blacksmith 's , whence he sent to inquire if I was gone for my walk . As it happened , I walked not till two o'clock . So there it stood waiting till I should go forth , and was introduced before my return . Fortunately too I went out at the church end of the village , and consequently saw nothing of it . How I could possibly pass it without seeing it , when it stood in the walk , I know not , but certain it is that I did . And where I shall fix it now , I know as little . It cannot stand between the two gates , the place of your choice , as I understand from Samuel , because the hay-cart must pass that way in the season . But we are now busy in winding the walk all round the orchard , and , in doing so , shall doubtless stumble at last upon some open spot that will suit it .</p>
   <p>There it shall stand while I live , a constant monument of your kindness .</p>
   <p>I have this moment finished the twelfth book of the Odyssey ; and I read the Iliad to Mrs. Unwin every evening .</p>
   <p>The effect of this reading is , that I still spy blemishes , something at least that I can mend ; so that , after all , the transcript of alterations which you and George have made will not be a perfect one . It would be foolish to forego an opportunity of improvement for such a reason ; neither will I . It is ten o'clock , and I must breakfast . Adieu , therefore , my dear Johnny ! Remember your appointment to see us in October .</p>
   <p>Ever yours , W. C .</p>

   <p>Non sum quod simulo , my dearest brother ! I am cheerful upon paper sometimes , when I am absolutely the most dejected of all creatures . Desirous however to gain something myself by my own letters , unprofitable as they may and must be to my friends , I keep melancholy out of them as much as I can , that I may , if possible , by assuming a less gloomy air , deceive myself , and , by feigning with a continuance , improve the fiction into reality .</p>
   <p>So you have seen Flaxman 's figures , which I intended you should not have seen till I had spread them before you . How did you dare to look at them ? You should have covered your eyes with both hands : I am charmed with Flaxman 's Penelope , and though you do n't deserve that I should , will send you a few lines , such as they are , with which she inspired me the other day while I was taking my noon-day walk .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The suitors sinn 'd , but with a fair excuse ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whom all this elegance might well seduce ;</l>

     <l n="4">Who , for a wife so lovely , slew them all .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I know not that you will meet any body here , when we see you in October , unless perhaps my Johnny should happen to be with us . If Tom is charmed with the thoughts of coming to Weston , we are equally so with the thoughts of seeing him here . At his years I should hardly hope to make his visit agreeable to him , did I not know that he is of a temper and disposition that must make him happy every where . Give our love to him . If Romney can come with you , we have both room to receive him and hearts to make him most welcome .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>A thousand thanks , my dearest Catharina , for your pleasant letter ; one of the pleasantest that I have received since your departure . You are very good to apologize for your delay , but I had not flattered myself with the hopes of a speedier answer . Knowing full well your talents for entertaining your friends who are present , I was sure you would with difficulty find half an hour that you could devote to an absent one .</p>
   <p>I am glad that you think of your return . Poor Weston is a desolation without you . In the meantime I amuse myself as well as I can , thrumming old Homer 's lyre , and turning the premises upside down . Upside down indeed , for so it is literally that I have been dealing with the orchard , almost ever since you went , digging and delving it around to make a new walk , which now begins to assume the shape of one , and to look as if some time or other it may serve in that capacity . Taking my usual exercise there the other day with Mrs. Unwin , a wide disagreement between your clock and ours occasioned me to complain much , as I have often done , of the want of a dial . Guess my surprise , when at the close of my complaint I saw one — saw one close at my side ; a smart one , glittering in the sun , and mounted on a pedestal of stone . I was astonished . “ This , ” I exclaimed , “ is absolute conjuration ! ” — It was a most mysterious affair , but the mystery was at last explained .</p>
   <p>This scribble I presume will find you just arrived at Bucklands . I would with all my heart that since dials can be thus suddenly conjured from one place to another , I could be so too , and could start up before your eyes in the middle of some walk or lawn , where you and Lady Frog are wandering .</p>
   <p>While Pitcairne whistles for his family estate in Fifeshire , he will do well if he will sound a few notes for me . I am originally of the same shire , and a family of my name is still there , to whom perhaps he may whistle on my behalf , not altogether in vain . So shall his fife excel all my poetical efforts , which have not yet , and I dare say never will , effectually charm one acre of ground into my possession .</p>
   <p>Remember me to Sir John , Lady Frog , and your husband — tell them I love them all . She told me once she was jealous , now indeed she seems to have some reason , since to her I have not written , and have written twice to you . But bid her be of good courage , in due time I will give her proof of my constancy .</p>

   <p>My dear Johnny ,— You have done well to leave off visiting and being visited . Visits are insatiable devourers of time , and fit only for those who , if they did not that , would do nothing . The worst consequence of such departures from common practice is to be termed a singular sort of a fellow , or an odd fish ; a sort of reproach that a man might be wise enough to contemn who had not half your understanding .</p>
   <p>I look forward with pleasure to October the 11th , the day which I expect will be albo notandus lapillo , on account of your arrival here .</p>
   <p>Here you will meet Mr. Rose , who comes on the 8th , and brings with him Mr. Lawrence , the painter , you may guess for what purpose . Lawrence returns when he has made his copy of me , but Mr. Rose will remain perhaps as long as you will . Hayley on the contrary will come , I suppose , just in time not to see you . Him we expect on the 20th . I trust , however , that thou wilt so order thy pastoral matters as to make thy stay here as long as possible .</p>
   <p>Lady Hesketh , in her last letter , inquires very kindly after you , asks me for your address , and purposes soon to write to you . We hope to see her in November — so that , after a summer without company , we are likely to have an autumn and a winter sociable enough .</p>

   <p>My good intentions towards you , my dearest brother , are continually frustrated ; and , which is most provoking , not by such engagements and avocations as have a right to my attention , such as those to my Mary and the old bard of Greece , but by mere impertinences , such as calls of civility from persons not very interesting to me , and letters from a distance still less interesting , because the writers of them are strangers . A man sent me a long copy of verses , which I could do no less than acknowledge . They were silly enough , and cost me eighteenpence , which was seventeenpence halfpenny farthing more than they were worth . Another sent me at the same time a plan , requesting my opinion of it , and that I would lend him my name as editor , a request with which I shall not comply , but I am obliged to tell him so , and one letter is all that I have time to despatch in a day , sometimes half a one , and sometimes I am not able to write at all . Thus it is that my time perishes , and I can neither give so much of it as I would to you or to any other valuable purpose .</p>
   <p>On Tuesday we expect company — Mr. Rose , and Lawrence the painter . Yet once more is my patience to be exercised , and once more I am made to wish that my face had been moveable , to put on and take off at pleasure , so as to be portable in a band-box , and sent to the artist . These however will be gone , as I believe I told you , before you arrive , at which time I know not that any body will be here , except my Johnny , whose presence will not at all interfere with our readings — you will not , I believe , find me a very slashing critic — I hardly indeed expect to find any thing in your Life of Milton that I shall sentence to amputation . How should it be too long ? A well-written work , sensible and spirited , such as yours was , when I saw it , is never so . But , however , we shall see . I promise to spare nothing that I think may be lopped off with advantage .</p>
   <p>I began this letter yesterday , but could not finish it till now . I have risen this morning like an infernal frog out of Acheron , covered with the ooze and mud of melancholy . For this reason I am not sorry to find myself at the bottom of my paper , for had I more room perhaps I might fill it all with croaking , and make an heart-ache at Eartham , which I wish to be always cheerful . Adieu . My poor sympathising Mary is of course sad , but always mindful of you .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— You are very kind to apologize for a short letter , instead of reproaching me with having been so long entirely silent . I persuaded myself , however , that while you were on your journey you would miss me less as a correspondent than you do when you are at home , and therefore allowed myself to pursue my literary labours only , but still purposing to write as soon as I should have reason to judge you returned to London . Hindrances , however , to the execution even of that purpose , have interposed ; and at this moment I write in the utmost haste , as indeed I always do , partly because I never begin a letter till I am already fatigued with study , and partly through fear of interruption before I can possibly finish it .</p>
   <p>I rejoice that you have travelled so much to your satisfaction . As to me , my travelling days , I believe , are over . Our journey of last year was less beneficial , both to Mrs. Unwin 's health and my spirits , than I hoped it might be ; and we are hardly rich enough to migrate in quest of pleasure merely .</p>
   <p>I thank you much for your last publication , which I am reading , as fast as I can snatch opportunity , to Mrs. Unwin . We have found it , as far as we have gone , both interesting and amusing ; and I never cease to wonder at the fertility of your invention , that , shut up as you were in your vessel , and disunited from the rest of mankind , could yet furnish you with such variety , and with the means , likewise , of saying the same thing in so many different ways .<span type="note_anchor">[ 724 ]</span></p>

I hope never to show myself unmindful of so great a favour . Two lines which I received yesterday from Mr. Hurdis , written hastily on the day of decision , informed me that it was made in his favour , and by a majority of twenty .<span type="note_anchor">[ 725 ]</span>I have great satisfaction in the event , and consequently hold myself indebted to all who at my instance have contributed to it .</p>

     <l n="3">young kinsman from Norfolk , and another of his favourite friends ,</l>
     <l n="4">Mr. Rose . The latter came recently from the seat of Lord Spencer , in</l>
     <l n="5">Northamptonshire , commissioned to invite Cowper , and his guests , to</l>
     <l n="6">Althorpe , where Gibbon , the historian , was making a visit of some</l>
     <l n="7">continuance .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Cowper was strongly urged to accept this flattering invitation from a nobleman whom he cordially respected , and whose library alone might be regarded as a magnet of very powerful attraction . But the constitutional shyness of the poet , and the infirm state of Mrs. Unwin 's health , conspired to prevent the meeting . It would have been curious to have contemplated the Poet of Christianity and the author of the celebrated sixteenth chapter in “ The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ” placed in juxtaposition with each other . The reflection would not have escaped a pious observer how much happier , in the eye of wisdom , was the state of Cowper , clouded as it was by depression and sorrow , than that of the unbelieving philosopher , though in the zenith of his fame . We know it has been asserted that men are not answerable for their creed . Why then are the Jews a scattered people , the living witnesses of the truth of a divine Revelation and of the avenging justice of God ? But scepticism can never justly be said to originate in want of evidence . Men doubt because they search after truth with the pride of the intellect , instead of seeking it with the simplicity of a little child , and that humility of spirit , by which only it is to be found .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>I seldom rejoice in a day of soaking rain like this , but in this , my dearest Catharina , I do rejoice sincerely , because it affords me an opportunity of writing to you , which , if fair weather had invited us into the orchard-walk at the usual hour , I should not easily have found . I am a most busy man , busy to a degree that sometimes half distracts me ; but , if complete distraction be occasioned by having the thoughts too much and too long attached to a single point , I am in no danger of it , with such a perpetual whirl are mine whisked about from one subject to another . When two poets meet , there are fine doings I can assure you . My Homer finds work for Hayley , and his Life of Milton work for me , so that we are neither of us one moment idle . Poor Mrs. Unwin in the meantime sits quiet in her corner , occasionally laughing at us both , and not seldom interrupting us with some question or remark , for which she is constantly rewarded by me with a “ Hush — hold your peace . ” Bless yourself , my dear Catharina , that you are not connected with a poet , especially that you have not two to deal with ; ladies who have , may be bidden indeed to hold their peace , but very little peace have they . How should they in fact have any , continually enjoined as they are to be silent .</p>
   <p>The same fever that has been so epidemic there , has been severely felt here likewise ; some have died , and a multitude have been in danger . Two under our own roof have been infected with it , and I am not sure that I have perfectly escaped myself , but I am now well again .</p>
   <p>I have persuaded Hayley to stay a week longer , and again my hopes revive , that he may yet have an opportunity to know my friends before he returns into Sussex . I write amidst a chaos of interruptions : Hayley on one hand spouts Greek , and on the other hand Mrs. Unwin continues talking , sometimes to us , and sometimes , because we are both too busy to attend to her , she holds a dialogue with herself . Query , is not this a bull — and ought I not instead of dialogue to have said soliloquy ?</p>
   <p>Adieu ! With our united love to all your party , and with ardent wishes soon to see you all at Weston , I remain , my dearest Catharina ,</p>
   <p>Ever yours , W. C .</p>
   <p>Though Cowper writes with apparent cheerfulness , yet Hayley , referring to this visit , remarks , “ My fears for him , in every point of view , were alarmed by his present very singular condition . He possessed completely , at this period , all the admirable faculties of his mind , and all the native tenderness of his heart ; but there was something indescribable in his appearance , which led me to apprehend that , without some signal event in his favour , to re-animate his spirits , they would gradually sink into hopeless dejection . The state of his aged infirm companion afforded additional ground for increasing solicitude . Her cheerful and beneficent spirit could hardly resist her own accumulated maladies , so far as to preserve ability sufficient to watch over the tender health of him , whom she had watched and guarded so long . ”</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances , Hayley , with an ardour of zeal and a regard for Cowper 's welfare , that reflect the highest honour upon his character , determined on his return to London to interest his more powerful friends in his behalf , and thus secure , if possible , a timely provision against future difficulties . The necessity for this act of kindness will soon appear to be painfully urgent . In the meantime he cheered Cowper 's mind , harassed by his Miltonic engagement , with intelligence that had a tendency to relieve him from much of his present embarrassment and dejection .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— In a letter from Lady Hesketh , which I received not long since , she informed me how very pleasantly she had spent some time at Wargrave . We now begin to expect her here , where our charms of situation are perhaps not equal to yours , yet by no means contemptible . She told me she had spoken to you in very handsome terms of the country round about us , but not so of our house and the view before it . The house itself , however , is not unworthy some commendation ; small as it is , it is neat , and neater than she is aware of ; for my study and the room over it have been repaired and beautified this summer , and little more was wanting to make it an abode sufficiently commodious for a man of my moderate desires . As to the prospect from it , that she misrepresented strangely , as I hope soon to have an opportunity to convince her by ocular demonstration . She told you , I know , of certain cottages opposite to us , or rather she described them as poor houses and hovels , that effectually blind our windows . But none such exist . On the contrary , the opposite object and the only one , is an orchard , so well planted , and with trees of such growth , that we seem to look into a wood , or rather to be surrounded by one . Thus , placed as we are in the midst of a village , we have none of those disagreeables that belong to such a position , and the village itself is one of the prettiest I know ; terminated at one end by the church tower , seen through the trees , and at the other by a very handsome gateway , opening into a fine grove of elms , belonging to our neighbour Courtenay . How happy should I be to show it instead of describing it to you !</p>
   <p>Adieu , my dear friend , W. C .</p>

     <l n="1">Weston , Nov. 10 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— You are very kind to consider my literary engagements , and to make them a reason for not interrupting me more frequently with a letter ; but though I am indeed as busy as an author or an editor can well be , and am not apt to be overjoyed at the arrival of letters from uninteresting quarters , I shall always , I hope , have leisure both to peruse and to answer those of my real friends , and to do both with pleasure .</p>
   <p>I have to thank you much for your benevolent aid in the affair of my friend Hurdis . You have doubtless learned , ere now , that he has succeeded , and carried the prize by a majority of twenty . He is well qualified for the post he has gained . So much the better for the honour of the Oxonian laurel , and so much the more for the credit of those who have favoured him with their suffrages .</p>
   <p>I am entirely of your mind respecting this conflagration by which all Europe suffers at present ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 726 ]</span>and is likely to suffer for a long time to come . The same mistake seems to have prevailed as in the American business . We then flattered ourselves that the colonies would prove an easy conquest , and , when all the neighbour nations armed themselves against France , we imagined , I believe , that she too would be presently vanquished . But we begin already to be undeceived , and God only knows to what a degree we may find we have erred at the conclusion . Such , however , is the state of things all around us , as reminds me continually of the Psalmist 's expression — “ He shall break them in pieces like a potter 's vessel . ” And I rather wish than hope , in some of my melancholy moods , that England herself may escape a fracture .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dear Sir ,— Though my congratulations have been delayed , you have no friend , numerous as your friends are , who has more sincerely rejoiced in your success than I . It was no small mortification to me , to find that three out of the six whom I had engaged were not qualified to vote . You have prevailed , however , and by a considerable majority ; there is therefore no room left for regret . When your short note arrived , which gave me the agreeable news of your victory , our friend of Eartham was with me , and shared largely in the joy that I felt on the occasion . He left me but a few days since , having spent somewhat more than a fortnight here ; during which time we employed all our leisure hours in the revisal of his Life of Milton . It is now finished , and a very finished work it is ; and one that will do great honour , I am persuaded , to the biographer , and the excellent man of injured memory who is the subject of it . As to my own concern with the works of this first of poets , which has been long a matter of burthensome contemplation , I have the happiness to find at last that I am at liberty to postpone my labours . While I expected that my commentary would be called for in the ensuing spring , I looked forward to the undertaking with dismay , not seeing a shadow of probability that I should be ready to answer the demand ; for this ultimate revisal of my Homer , together with the notes , occupies completely at present ( and will for some time longer ) all the little leisure that I have for study — leisure which I gain at this season of the year by rising long before daylight .</p>
   <p>You are now become a nearer neighbour , and , as your professorship , I hope , will not engross you wholly , will find an opportunity to give me your company at Weston . Let me hear from you soon ; tell me how you like your new office , and whether you perform the duties of it with pleasure to yourself . With much pleasure to others you will , I doubt not , and with equal advantage .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— I have risen , while the owls are still hooting , to pursue my accustomed labours in the mine of Homer ; but before I enter upon them , shall give the first moment of daylight to the purpose of thanking you for your last letter , containing many pleasant articles of intelligence , with nothing to abate the pleasantness of them , except the single circumstance that we are not likely to see you here so soon as I expected . My hope was , that the first frost would bring you and the amiable painter with you .<span type="note_anchor">[ 727 ]</span>If , however , you are prevented by the business of your respective professions , you are well prevented , and I will endeavour to be patient . When the latter was here , he mentioned one day the subject of Diomede 's horses , driven under the axle of his chariot by the thunderbolt which fell at their feet , as a subject for his pencil .<span type="note_anchor">[ 728 ]</span>It is certainly a noble one , and therefore worthy of his study and attention . It occurred to me at the moment , but I know not what it was that made me forget it again the next moment , that the horses of Achilles flying over the foss , with Patroclus and Automedon in the chariot , would be a good companion for it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 729 ]</span>Should you happen to recollect this , when you next see him , you may submit it , if you please , to his consideration . I stumbled yesterday on another subject , which reminded me of said excellent artist , as likely to afford a fine opportunity to the expression that he could give it . It is found in the shooting match in the twenty-third book of the Iliad , between Meriones and Teucer . The former cuts the string with which the dove is tied to the mast-head , and sets her at liberty ; the latter , standing at his side , in all the eagerness of emulation , points an arrow at the mark with his right hand , while with his left he snatches the bow from his competitor ; he is a fine poetical figure , but Mr. Lawrence himself must judge whether or not he promises as well for the canvas .<span type="note_anchor">[ 730 ]</span></p>

To say the truth , when a man has once turned his mind inside out for the inspection of all who choose to inspect it , to make a secret of his face seems but little better than a self-contradiction . At the same time , however , I shall be best pleased if it be kept , according to your intentions , as a rarity .</p>

   <p>My dear Friend ,— In my last I forgot to thank you for the box of books , containing also the pamphlets . We have read , that is to say , my cousin has , who reads to us in the evening , the history of Jonathan Wild ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 731 ]</span>and found it highly entertaining . The satire on great men is witty , and I believe perfectly just : we have no censure to pass on it , unless that we think the character of Mrs. Heartfree not well sustained ; not quite delicate in the latter part of it ; and that the constant effect of her charms upon every man who sees her , has a sameness in it that is tiresome , and betrays either much carelessness , or idleness , or lack of invention . It is possible , indeed , that the author might intend by this circumstance a satirical glance at novelists , whose heroines are generally all bewitching ; but it is a fault that he had better have noticed in another manner , and not have exemplified in his own .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 731 ]</span>A production of Fielding 's .</p>
   <p>The first volume of Man as He is has lain unread in my study-window this twelvemonth , and would have been returned unread to its owner , had not my cousin come in good time to save it from that disgrace .

    <head>TO WILLIAM HAYLEY , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston , Dec. 8 , 1793 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I have waited , and waited impatiently , for a line from you , and am at last determined to send you one , to inquire what has become of you , and why you are silent so much longer than usual .</p>
   <p>I want to know many things , which only you can tell me , but especially I want to know what has been the issue of your conference with Nichol : has he seen your work ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 732 ]</span>I am impatient for the appearance of it , because impatient to have the spotless credit of the great poet 's character , as a man and a citizen , vindicated , as it ought to be , and as it never will be again .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 732 ]</span>Hayley 's Life of Milton .</p>
   <p>It is a great relief to me , that my Miltonic labours are suspended . I am now busy in transcribing the alterations of Homer , having finished the whole revisal . I must then write a new preface , which done , I shall endeavour immediately to descant on The Four Ages .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! my dear brother , W. C .</p>
   <p>The Miltonic labours of Cowper were not only suspended at this time , but we lament to say never resumed .</p>
   <p>There is a period in the history of men of letters , when the mind begins to shrink from the toil and responsibility of a great undertaking , and to feel the necessity of contracting its exertions within limits more suited to its diminished powers . Physical and moral causes are often found to co-operate in hastening this crisis . The sensibilities that are inseparable from genius , the ardour that consumes itself by its own fires , the labour of thought , and the inadequacy of the body to sustain the energies of the soul within — these often unite in harassing the spirits , and sowing the seeds of a premature decay . Such was now the case with Cowper . His literary exertions had been too unremitting , and though we must allow much to the influence of his unhappy malady , and to the illness of Mrs. Unwin , yet there can be no doubt that his long and laborious habits of study had no small share in undermining his constitution .</p>
   <p>It seems desirable therefore , at this period , to refer to the intended edition of Milton , and briefly to state the result of his labours .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The design is thus stated by Cowper himself , in one of his letters .</l>
     <l n="2">“ A Milton , that is to rival , and if possible to exceed in splendour ,</l>
     <l n="3">Boydell 's Shakspeare , is in contemplation , and I am in the Editor 's</l>
     <l n="4">office . Fuseli is the painter . My business will be to select notes</l>
     <l n="5">from others , and to write original notes ; to translate the Latin and</l>
     <l n="6">Italian poems , and to give a correct text . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">All that he was enabled to accomplish of this undertaking was as</l>
     <l n="8">follows :</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">He commenced the series of his translations about the middle of</l>
     <l n="10">September , 1791 . In February , 1792 , he had completed all his</l>
     <l n="11">Latin pieces , and shortly after he finished the Italian . While at</l>
     <l n="12">Eartham , in August , he revised all his translations , and they were</l>
     <l n="13">subsequently retouched , in his declining strength , at East Dereham .</l>
     <l n="14">From an amiable desire to avoid what might create irritation , he</l>
     <l n="15">omitted the Poems against the Catholics , and thus assigned his</l>
     <l n="16">motives in a letter to Johnson .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">Weston , Oct. 30 , 1791 .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ We and the Papists are at present on amicable terms . They have behaved themselves peaceably many years , and have lately received favours from Government . I should think , therefore , that the dying embers of ancient animosity had better not be troubled . ”</p>
   <p>He also omitted a few of the minuter poems , as not worthy of being ranked with the rest .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">He was assisted in the execution of this work by the Adamo of</l>
     <l n="2">Andreini , Bentley 's Milton , an interleaved copy of Newton 's , and</l>
     <l n="3">Warton 's edition of the minor poems .<span type="note_anchor">[ 733 ]</span></l>
   </lg>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 733 ]</span>Of these editions of Milton , that of Bentley has always been considered a complete failure . It is remarkable for the boldness of its conjectural emendations , and for the liberties taken with the text . An amusing anecdote is recorded on this subject . To a friend expostulating with him on the occasion , and urging that it was impossible for Milton , in so many instances , to have written as he alleged , he replied with his characteristic spirit , “ Then he ought to have written so . ” Bishop Newton 's edition has acquired just celebrity , and has served as the basis of all subsequent editions . It has been deservedly called “ the best edited English Classic up to the period of its publication . ” Warton 's edition of “ The Juvenile and Minor Poems ” discovers a classical and elegant taste . Its merit , however , is greatly impaired by the severity of its censures on Milton 's republican and religious principles . It was to rescue that great poet from the animadversions of Warton and Dr. Johnson that Hayley engaged in a life of Milton , which does honour to the manliness and generosity of his feelings . But the most powerful defence is that of the Rev . Dr. Symmons , who , with considerable vigour of thought and language , has taken a most comprehensive view of the character and prose writings of Milton . He would have been entitled to distinguished praise , if , in vindicating the republicanism of Milton , he had not deeply fallen into it himself . In the present day the clouds of prejudice seem to have subsided , and the errors of the politician are deservedly forgotten in the celebrity of the poet . There was a period when , according to Dr. Johnson , a monument to Philips , with an inscription by Atterbury , in which he was said to be soli Miltono secundus , was refused admittance by Dean Sprat into Westminster Abbey , on the ground of its “ being too detestable to be read on the wall of a building dedicated to devotion . ”</p>
   <p>The honours of a monument were at length conceded to Milton himself ; but the beautiful and elegant Latin inscription , composed by Dr. George , Provost of King 's College , Cambridge , shows that it was thought necessary to apologize for its admission into that sacred repository of kings and prelates . *</p>
   <p>* We cannot refrain from enriching our pages with this much admired Epitaph .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Augusti regum cineres sanctæque favillæ</l>
     <l n="2">Heroum , Vosque O ! venerandi nominis umbræ !</l>
     <l n="3">Parcite , quod vestris , infensum regibus olim ,</l>
     <l n="4">Sedibus infertur nomen : liceatque supremis</l>
     <l n="5">Funeribus finire odia , et mors obruat iras .</l>
     <l n="6">Nunc sub foederibus coeant felicibus , una</l>
     <l n="7">Libertas , et jus sacri inviolabile sceptri .</l>
     <l n="8">Rege sub Augusto fas sit laudare Catonem . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>With respect to his critical labours , he proceeded with singular slowness and difficulty . It appears to have been a most oppressive burden on his spirits . “ Milton especially , ” he observes , “ is my grievance ; and I might almost as well be haunted by his ghost as goaded with continual reproaches for neglecting him . ” He was always soliciting more time , and when the appointed period was expired , he renewed his application for fresh delay . His commentary is restricted to the three first books of the Paradise Lost .</p>
   <p>This seems to imply that however nature designed him to be a poet , she denied the qualifications necessary to constitute the critic ; for it will generally be found , that to execute with delight and ease is the attribute of genius , and the evidence of natural impulse ; and that slowness of performance indicates the want of those powers that afford the promise and pledge of success .</p>
   <p>In this unfinished state , the work was published by Hayley , in the year 1808 , for the benefit of the second son of Mr. Rose , the godchild of Cowper . Some designs in outline were furnished by Flaxman , highly characteristic of his graceful style .</p>
   <p>The translations are a perfect model of beautiful and elegant versification .</p>
   <p>We consider Milton 's address to his father to be one of the most beautiful compositions extant , and rejoice in presenting it to the reader in an English form , so worthy of the original Latin poem .</p>

     <l n="38">We subjoin Hayley 's remark on this poem , in Cowper 's edition of</l>
     <l n="39">Milton .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ These verses are founded on one of the most interesting subjects that language can display , the warmth and felicity of strong reciprocal kindness between a father and a son , not only united by the most sacred tie of nature , but still more endeared to each other by the happy cultivation of honourable and congenial arts . The sublime description of poetry , and the noble and graceful portrait , which the author here exhibits of his own mental character , may be said to render this splendid poem the prime jewel in a coronet of variegated gems . ”</p>
   <p>We extract the following passages from the remarks and notes in Cowper 's Milton , as exhibiting the manner in which he executed this portion of his labours .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>BOOK I .</head>
    <head>“ There is a solemnity of sentiment , as well as majesty of numbers , in the exordium of this noble poem , which , in the works of the ancients , has no example .</head>
    <head>“ The sublimest of all subjects was reserved for Milton ; and , bringing to the contemplation of that subject , not only a genius equal to the best of theirs but a heart also deeply impregnated with the divine truths which lay before him , it is no wonder that he has produced a composition , on the whole , superior to any that we have received from former ages . But he who addresses himself to the perusal of this work , with a mind entirely unaccustomed to serious and spiritual contemplation , unacquainted with the word of God , or prejudiced against it , is ill qualified to appreciate the value of a poem built upon it , or to taste its beauties . Milton is the poet of Christians : an infidel may have an ear for the harmony of his numbers , may be aware of the dignity of his expression , and , in some degree , of the sublimity of his conceptions ; but the unaffected and masculine piety , which was his true inspirer , and is the very soul of his poem , he will either not perceive , or it will offend him . ”</head>

   </lg>
   <p>“ In this we seem to hear a thunder suited both to the scene and the occasion , incomparably more awful than any ever heard on earth , and the thunder winged with lightning is highly poetical . It may be observed here , that the thunder of Milton is not hurled from the hand like Homer 's , but discharged like an arrow . Thus in book vi . line 712 , the Father , ordering forth the Son for the destruction of the rebel angels , says —</p>
   <lg>

   <p>“ This is another instance in which appears the advantage that Milton derives from the grandeur of his subject . What description could even he have given of a host of human warriors insulting their conqueror , at all comparable to this ? First , their multitude is to be noticed . They are not thousands but millions ; and they are millions , not of puny mortals , but of mighty cherubim . Their swords flame , not metaphorically , but they are swords of fire ; they flash not by reflection of the sunbeams , like the swords of Homer , but by their own light , and that light plays not idly in the broad day , but far round illumines Hell . And lastly , they defy not a created being like themselves , but the Almighty . ”</p>

   <p>“ The reader loses half the beauty of this charming simile , who does not give particular attention to the numbers . There is a majesty in them not often equalled , and never surpassed , even by this great poet himself ; the movement is uncommonly slow ; an effect produced by means already hinted at , the assemblage of a greater proportion of long syllables than usual . The pauses are also managed with great skill and judgment ; while the clouds rise , and the heavens gather blackness , they fall in those parts of the verse , where they retard the reader most , and thus become expressive of the solemnity of the subject ; but in the latter part of the simile , when the sun breaks out , and the scene brightens , they are so disposed as to allow the verse an easier and less interrupted flow , more suited to the cheerfulness of the occasion . ”</p>
   <p>He concludes with the following summary of the great doctrines that form the foundation of the Paradise Lost .</p>
   <p>“ It may not be amiss , at the close of these admirable speeches — as admirable for their sound divinity as for the perspicuity with which it is expressed — to allow ourselves a moment 's pause , for the purpose of taking a short retrospect of the doctrines contained in them . Man , in the beginning , is placed in a probationary state , and made the arbiter of his own destiny . By his own fault , he forfeits happiness , both for himself and his descendants . But mercy interposes for his restoration . That mercy is represented as perfectly free , as vouchsafed to the most unworthy ; to creatures so entirely dead in sin as to be destitute even of a sense of their need of it , and consequently too stupid even to ask it . They are also as poor as they are unfeeling ; and , were it possible that they could affect themselves with a just sense and apprehension of their lapsed condition , they would have no compensation to offer to their offended Maker , nothing with which they can satisfy the demands of his justice ,— in short , no atonement . In this ruinous state of their affairs , and when all hope of reconciliation seems lost for ever , the Son of God voluntarily undertakes for them ,— undertakes to become the son of man also , and to suffer , in man 's stead , the penalty annexed to his transgression . In consequence of this self-substitution , Christ becomes the federal head of his church , and the sole author of salvation to his people . As Adam 's sin was imputed to his posterity , so the faultless obedience of the second Adam is imputed to all , who , in the great concern of justification , shall renounce their own obedience as imperfect and therefore incompetent . The sentence is thus reversed as to all believers : ‘ Death is swallowed up in victory . ’ The Saviour presents the redeemed before the throne of the Eternal Father , in whose countenance no longer any symptom of displeasure appears against them , but their joy and peace are thenceforth perfect . The general resurrection takes place ; the saints are made assessors with Christ in the judgment , both of men and angels ; the new heaven and earth , the destined habitation of the just , succeed ; the Son of God , his whole undertaking accomplished , surrenders the kingdom to his Father : God becomes all in all ! It is easy to see , that , among these doctrines , there are some which , in modern times , have been charged with novelty ; but how new they are Milton is a witness . ”</p>
   <p>Fuseli , whose labours were so unfortunately superseded , completed a series of admirable paintings from subjects furnished by the Paradise Lost ; which were afterwards exhibited in London , under the name of the Milton Gallery . He thus acquired a reputation which placed him in the first rank of artists ; and the amateur had the opportunity of seeing , in the Shakspeare and Milton galleries , the most distinguished painters engaged in illustrating the productions of the two greatest authors that ever adorned any age or country .<span type="note_anchor">[ 737 ]</span></p>

   <p>This projected edition of Milton is remarkable as having laid the foundation of the intercourse , which soon ripened into friendship , between Cowper and Hayley . The latter was at that time engaged in writing a life of Milton , which gave rise to his being represented as an opponent of Cowper . To exonerate himself from such an imputation , he wrote the letter which we subjoin in a note .<span type="note_anchor">[ 738 ]</span></p>

   <p>Eartham , Feb. 1792 .</p>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— I have often been tempted , by affectionate admiration of your poetry , to trouble you with a letter ; but I have repeatedly checked myself in recollecting that the vanity of believing ourselves distantly related in spirit to a man of genius is but a sorry apology for intruding on his time .</p>
   <p>Though I resisted my desire of professing myself your friend , that I might not disturb you with intrusive familiarity , I cannot resist a desire , equally affectionate , of disclaiming an idea which I am told is imputed to me , of considering myself , on a recent occasion , as an antagonist to you . Allow me , therefore , to say , I was solicited to write a Life of Milton , for Boydell and Nichol , before I had the least idea that you and Mr. Fuseli were concerned in a project similar to theirs . When I first heard of your intention , I was apprehensive that we might undesignedly thwart each other ; but , on seeing your proposals , I am agreeably persuaded that our respective labours will be far from clashing ; as it is your design to illustrate Milton with a series of notes , and I only mean to execute a more candid life of him than his late biographer has given us , upon a plan that will , I flatter myself , be particularly pleasing to those who love the author as we do .</p>
   <p>As to the pecuniary interest of those persons who venture large sums in expensive decoration of Milton , I am persuaded his expanding glory will support them all . Every splendid edition , where the merits of the pencil are in any degree worthy of the poet , will , I think , be secure of success . I wish it cordially to all ; as I have a great affection for the arts , and a sincere regard for those whose talents reflect honour upon them .</p>
   <p>To you , my dear sir , I have a grateful attachment , for the infinite delight which your writings have afforded me ; and if , in the course of your work , I have any opportunity to serve or oblige you , I shall seize it with that friendly spirit which has impelled me at present to assure you , both in prose and rhyme , that I am your cordial admirer ,</p>
   <p>W. HAYLEY .</p>
   <p>P. S . I wrote the enclosed sonnet on being told that our names had been idly printed together in a newspaper , as hostile competitors . Pray forgive its partial defects for its affectionate sincerity . From my ignorance of your address , I send this to your bookseller 's by a person commissioned to place my name in the list of your subscribers ; and let me add , if you ever wish to form a new collection of names for any similar purpose , I entreat you to honour me so far as to rank mine , of your own accord , among those of your sincerest friends .

   <p>You mentioned , my dear friend , in your last letter , an unfavourable sprain that you had received , which you apprehended might be very inconvenient to you for some time to come ; and having learned also from Lady Hesketh the same unwelcome intelligence , in terms still more alarming than those in which you related the accident yourself , I cannot but be anxious , as well as my cousin , to know the present state of it ; and shall truly rejoice to hear that it is in a state of recovery . Give us a line of information on this subject , as soon as you can conveniently , and you will much oblige us .</p>
   <p>I write by morning candle-light ; my literary business obliging me to be an early riser . Homer demands me : finished , indeed , but the alterations not transcribed : a work to which I am now hastening as fast as possible . The transcript ended , which is likely to amount to a good sizeable volume , I must write a new preface : and then farewell to Homer for ever ! And if the remainder of my days be a little gilded with the profits of this long and laborious work , I shall not regret the time that I have bestowed on it .</p>

   <p>Can you give us any news of Lord Howe 's Armada ; concerning which we may inquire , as our forefathers did of the Spanish ,— “ an in coelum sublata sit , an in Tartarum depressa ? "[ 740 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 740 ]</span>Lord Howe was at this time in pursuit of the French fleet , and absent six weeks , during which the public received no intelligence of his movements . His lordship at length returned , having only seen the enemy , but without having been able to overtake and bring them to action . Though this furnished no argument against him , but rather showed the terror that he inspired , yet some of the wits of the day wrote the following jeu d'esprit on the occasion .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">When Cæsar triumph 'd o'er his Gallic foes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Three words concise ,* his gallant acts disclose ;</l>

   <p>Lord Howe subsequently proved his claim to the whole of this celebrated despatch of Cæsar , by the great victory which he gained off Ushant over the French fleet , June 1 , 1794 , a victory which forms one of the brightest triumphs of the British navy .</p>
   <p>The reader may now be anxious to learn some particulars of the projected poem , which has been repeatedly mentioned under the title of The Four Ages ; a poem to which the mind of Cowper looked eagerly forward , as to a new and highly promising field for his excursive fancy . The idea had been suggested to him in the year 1791 , by his clerical neighbour , Mr. Buchanan , of Ravenstone , a small sequestered village within the distance of an easy walk from Weston . This gentleman , who had occasionally enjoyed the gratification of visiting Cowper , suggested to him , with a becoming diffidence , the project of a new poem on the four distinct periods of life — infancy , youth , manhood , and old age . He imparted his ideas to the poet by a letter , in which he observed , with equal modesty and truth , that Cowper was particularly qualified to relish , and to do justice to the subject ; a subject which he supposed not hitherto treated expressly , as its importance deserved , by any poet ancient or modern .</p>
   <p>Mr. Buchanan added to this letter a brief sketch of contents for the projected composition . This hasty sketch he enlarged , at the request of Cowper . How the poet appreciated the suggestion will appear from the following billet .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— You have sent me a beautiful poem , wanting nothing but metre . I would to heaven that you would give it that requisite yourself ; for he who could make the sketch , cannot but be well qualified to finish . But if you will not , I will ; provided always nevertheless , that God gives me ability , for it will require no common share to do justice to your conceptions .</p>
   <p>I am much yours , W. C .</p>
   <p>Your little messenger vanished before I could catch him .</p>
   <p>This work , in his first conception of it , was greatly endeared to him , but he soon entertained an apprehension that he should never accomplish it . Writing to his friend of St. Paul 's in 1793 , the poet said — “ The Four Ages is a subject that delights me when I think of it ; but I am ready to fear , that all my ages will be exhausted before I shall be at leisure to write upon it . ”</p>
   <p>A fragment is all that he has left , for which we refer the reader to the Poems . In his happier days , it would have been expanded in a manner more commensurate with the copiousness of the subject , and the poetical powers of the author .</p>
   <p>It may be interesting to add , that a modern poem on the Four Ages of Man was written by M. Werthmuller , a citizen of Zurich , and translated into Latin verse , by Dr. Olstrochi , librarian to the Ambrosian library at Milan . This performance gave rise to another German poem on the Four Ages of Woman , by M. Zacharie , professor of poetry at Brunswick .</p>
   <p>The increasing infirmities of Cowper 's aged companion , Mrs. Unwin , his filial solicitude to alleviate her sufferings , and the gathering clouds of deeper despondency that began to settle on his mind , in the first month of the year 1794 , not only rendered it impossible for him to advance in any great original performance , but , to use his own expressive words , in the close of his correspondence with his highly-valued friend , Mr. Rose , made all composition either of poetry or prose impracticable . Writing to that friend in January 1794 , he says , “ I have just ability enough to transcribe , which is all that I have to do at present : God knows that I write , at this moment , under the pressure of sadness not to be described . ”</p>
   <p>It was a spectacle that might awaken compassion in the sternest of human characters , to see the health , the comfort , and the little fortune of a man , so distinguished by intellectual endowments , and by moral excellence , perishing most deplorably . A sight so affecting made many friends of Cowper solicitous and importunate that his declining life should be honourably protected by public munificence . Men of all parties agreed that a pension might be granted to an author of his acknowledged merit , with graceful propriety .</p>
   <p>But such is the difficulty of doing real good , experienced even by the great and powerful , or so apt are statesmen to forget the pressing exigence of meritorious individuals , in the distractions of official perplexity , that month after month elapsed , without the accomplishment of so desirable an object .</p>
   <p>Imagination can hardly devise any human condition more truly affecting than the state of the poet at this period . His generous and faithful guardian , Mrs. Unwin , who had preserved him through seasons of the severest calamity , was now , with her faculties and fortune impaired , sinking fast into second childhood . The distress of heart that he felt in beholding the afflicting change in a companion so justly dear to him , conspiring with his constitutional melancholy , was gradually undermining the exquisite faculties of his mind . The disinterested and affectionate kindness of Lady Hesketh , at this crisis , deserves to be recorded in terms of the highest commendation . With a magnanimity of feeling to which it is difficult to do justice , and to the visible detriment of her health , she nobly devoted herself to the superintendence of a house , whose two interesting inhabitants were almost incapacitated from attending to the ordinary offices of life . Those only who have lived with the superannuated and the melancholy , can properly appreciate the value of such a sacrifice .</p>
   <p>The two last of Cowper 's letters to Hayley , that breathe a spirit of mental activity and cheerful friendship , were written in the close of the year 1793 , and in the beginning of the next . They arose from an accident that it may be proper to relate , before we insert them .</p>
   <p>On Hayley 's return from Weston , he had given an account of the poet to his old friend , Lord Thurlow . That learned and powerful critic , in speaking of Cowper 's Homer , declared himself not satisfied with his version of Hector 's admirable prayer in caressing his child . Both ventured on new translations of this prayer , which were immediately sent to Cowper , and the following letters will prove with what just and manly freedom of spirit he was at this time able to criticize the composition of his friends and his own .</p>

    <head>TO WILLIAM HAYLEY , ESQ .</head>

     <l n="2">Oh Jove ! and all ye Gods ! grant this my son</l>
     <l n="3">To prove , like me , pre-eminent in Troy !</l>
     <l n="4">In valour such , and firmness of command !</l>
     <l n="5">Be he extoll 'd , when he returns from fight ,</l>
     <l n="6">As far his sire 's superior ! may he slay</l>

     <l n="8">And may his mother 's heart o'erflow with joy !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>I rose this morning , at six o'clock , on purpose to translate this prayer again , and to write to my dear brother . Here you have it , such as it is , not perfectly according to my own liking , but as well as I could make it , and I think better than either yours or Lord Thurlow 's . You with your six lines have made yourself stiff and ungraceful , and he with his seven has produced as good prose as heart can wish , but no poetry at all . A scrupulous attention to the letter has spoiled you both ; you have neither the spirit nor the manner of Homer . A portion of both may be found , I believe , in my version , but not so much as I could wish — it is better however than the printed one . His lordship 's two first lines I cannot very well understand ; he seems to me to give a sense to the original that does not belong to it . Hector , I apprehend , does not say , “ Grant that he may prove himself my son , and be eminent , ” &amp; c .— but “ grant that this my son may prove eminent ” — which is a material difference . In the latter sense I find the simplicity of an ancient ; in the former , that is to say , in the notion of a man proving himself his father 's son by similar merit , the finesse and dexterity of a modern . His lordship too makes the man , who gives the young hero his commendation , the person who returns from battle ; whereas Homer makes the young hero himself that person , at least if Clarke is a just interpreter , which I suppose is hardly to be disputed .</p>
   <p>If my old friend would look into my Preface , he would find a principle laid down there , which perhaps it would not be easy to invalidate , and which properly attended to would equally secure a translation from stiffness and from wildness . The principle I mean is this — “ Close , but not so close as to be servile ! free , but not so free as to be licentious ! ” A superstitious fidelity loses the spirit , and a loose deviation the sense of the translated author — a happy moderation in either case is the only possible way of preserving both .</p>
   <p>Thus I have disciplined you both , and now , if you please , you may both discipline me . I shall not enter my version in my book till it has undergone your strictures at least , and , should you write to the noble critic again , you are welcome to submit it to his . We are three awkward fellows indeed , if we cannot amongst us make a tolerable good translation of six lines of Homer .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! W. C .</p>

   <p>My dear Hayley ,— I have waited , but waited in vain , for a propitious moment when I might give my old friend 's objections the consideration they deserve ; I shall at last be forced to send a vague answer , unworthy to be sent to a person accustomed , like him , to close reasoning and abstruse discussion ; for I rise after ill rest , and with a frame of mind perfectly unsuited to the occasion . I sit too at the window for light 's sake , where I am so cold that my pen slips out of my fingers . First , I will give you a translation , de novo , of this untranslateable prayer . It is shaped as nearly as I could contrive to his lordship 's ideas , but I have little hope that it will satisfy him .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Grant Jove , and all ye Gods , that this my son</l>
     <l n="2">Be , as myself have been , illustrious here !</l>
     <l n="3">A valiant man ! and let him reign in Troy !</l>
     <l n="4">May all who witness his return from fight</l>
     <l n="5">Hereafter , say — he far excels his sire ;</l>
     <l n="6">And let him bring back gory trophies , stript</l>
     <l n="7">From foes slain by him , to his mother 's joy .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Imlac in Rasselas says — I forget to whom , “ You have convinced me that it is impossible to be a poet . ” In like manner I might say to his lordship , you have convinced me that it is impossible to be a translator ; to be a translator , on his terms at least , is I am sure impossible . On his terms , I would defy Homer himself , were he alive , to translate the Paradise Lost into Greek . Yet Milton had Homer much in his eye when he composed that poem ; whereas Homer never thought of me or my translation . There are minutiæ in every language , which , transfused into another , will spoil the version . Such extreme fidelity is in fact unfaithful . Such close resemblance takes away all likeness . The original is elegant , easy , natural ; the copy is clumsy , constrained , unnatural : to what is this owing ? To the adoption of terms not congenial to your purpose , and of a context , such as no man writing an original work would make use of . Homer is every thing that a poet should be . A translation of Homer , so made , will be every thing a translation of Homer should not be ; because it will be written in no language under heaven . It will be English , and it will be Greek , and therefore it will be neither . He is the man , whoever he be , ( I do not pretend to be that man myself ,) he is the man best qualified as a translator of Homer , who has drenched , and steeped , and soaked himself in the effusions of his genius , till he has imbibed their colour to the bone , and who , when he is thus dyed through and through , distinguishing between what is essentially Greek , and what may be habited in English , rejects the former , and is faithful to the latter , as far as the purposes of fine poetry will permit , and no farther : this , I think , may be easily proved . Homer is everywhere remarkable either for ease , dignity , or energy of expression ; for grandeur of conception , and a majestic flow of numbers . If we copy him so closely as to make every one of these excellent properties of his absolutely unattainable , which will certainly be the effect of too close a copy , instead of translating , we murder him . Therefore , after all his lordship has said , I still hold freedom to be an indispensable — freedom , I mean , with respect to the expression ; freedom so limited , as never to leave behind the matter ; but at the same time indulged with a sufficient scope to secure the spirit , and as much as possible of the manner . I say as much as possible , because an English manner must differ from a Greek one , in order to be graceful , and for this there is no remedy . Can an ungraceful , awkward , translation of Homer be a good one ? No : but a graceful , easy , natural , faithful version of him , will not that be a good one ? Yes : allow me but this , and I insist upon it , that such a one may be produced on my principles , and can be produced on no other .</p>
   <p>I have not had time to criticise his lordship 's other version . You know how little time I have for anything , and can tell him so .</p>
   <p>Adieu ! my dear brother . I have now tired both you and myself ; and with the love of the whole trio , remain yours ever ,</p>
   <p>W. C .</p>
   <p>Reading his lordship 's sentiments over again , I am inclined to think , that in all I have said , I have only given him back the same in other terms . He disallows both the absolute free , and the absolute close — so do I , and , if I understand myself , I said so in my preface . He wishes to recommend a medium , though he will not call it so — so do I ; only we express it differently . What is it then that we dispute about ? My head is not good enough to-day to discover .</p>
   <p>These letters were followed by such a silence on the part of Cowper , as excited the severest apprehensions , which were painfully confirmed by the intelligence conveyed in the ensuing letter :—</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>FROM THE REV . MR. GREATHEED — TO WILLIAM HAYLEY , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Newport Pagnel , April 8 , 1794 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— Lady Hesketh 's correspondence acquainted you with the melancholy relapse of our dear friend at Weston ; but I am uncertain whether you know , that in the last fortnight he has refused food of every kind , except now and then a very small piece of toasted bread dipped generally in water , sometimes mixed with a little wine . This , her ladyship informs me , was the case till last Saturday , since when he has eat a little at each family meal . He persists in refusing such medicines as are indispensable to his state of body . In such circumstances , his long continuance in life cannot be expected . How devoutly to be wished is the alleviation of his danger and distress ! You , dear sir , who know so well the worth of our beloved and admired friend , sympathise with his affliction , and deprecate his loss doubtless in no ordinary degree : you have already most effectually expressed and proved the warmth of your friendship . I cannot think that anything but your society would have been sufficient , during the infirmity under which his mind has long been oppressed , to have supported him against the shock of Mrs. Unwin 's paralytic attack . I am certain that nothing else could have prevailed upon him to undertake the journey to Eartham . You have succeeded where his other friends knew they could not , and where they apprehended no one could . How natural therefore , nay , how reasonable , is it for them to look to you , as most likely to be instrumental , under the blessing of God , for relief in the present distressing and alarming crisis ! It is indeed scarcely attemptable to ask any person to take such a journey , and involve himself in so melancholy a scene , with an uncertainty of the desired success ; increased as the apparent difficulty is by dear Mr. Cowper 's aversion to all company , and by poor Mrs. Unwin 's mental and bodily infirmities . On these accounts Lady Hesketh dares not ask it of you , rejoiced as she would be at your arrival . Am I not , dear sir , a very presumptuous person , who , in the face of all opposition , dare do this ? I am emboldened by those two powerful supporters , conscience and experience . Was I at Eartham , I would certainly undertake the labour I presume to recommend , for the bare possibility of restoring Mr. Cowper to himself , to his friends , to the public , and to God .</p>
   <p>Hayley , on the receipt of this letter , lost no time in repairing to Weston ; but his unhappy friend was too much overwhelmed by his oppressive malady to show even the least glimmering of satisfaction at the appearance of a guest whom he used to receive with the most lively expressions of affectionate delight .</p>
   <p>It is the nature of this tremendous melancholy , not only to enshroud and stifle the finest faculties of the mind , but it suspends , and apparently annihilates , for a time , the strongest and best-rooted affections of the heart .</p>
   <p>Lady Hesketh , profiting by Hayley 's presence , quitted her charge for a few days , that she might have a personal conference with Dr. Willis . A friendly letter from Lord Thurlow to that celebrated physician had requested his attention to the highly interesting sufferer . Dr. Willis prescribed for Cowper , and saw him at Weston , but not with that success and felicity which made his medical skill on another most awful occasion the source of national delight and exultation .</p>
   <p>Indeed , the extraordinary state of Cowper appeared to abound with circumstances very unfavourable to his mental relief . The daily sight of a being reduced to such deplorable imbecility as now overwhelmed Mrs. Unwin , was in itself sufficient to plunge a tender spirit into extreme melancholy ; yet to separate two friends , so long accustomed to minister , with the purest and most vigilant benevolence , to the infirmities of each other , was a measure so pregnant with complicated distraction , that it could not be advised or attempted . It remained only to palliate the suffering of each in their present most pitiable condition , and to trust in the mercy of that God , who had supported them together through periods of very dark affliction , though not so doubly deplorable as the present .</p>
   <p>Who can contemplate this distressing spectacle without recalling the following pathetic exclamation in the Sampson Agonistes of Milton ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">God of our fathers , what is man ?</l>
     <l n="2">. . . . .</l>
     <l n="3">Since such as thou hast solemnly elected ,</l>
     <l n="4">With gifts and graces eminently adorned ;</l>
     <l n="5">. . . . .</l>
     <l n="6">Yet towards these thus dignified , thou oft</l>
     <l n="7">Amidst their height of noon ,</l>
     <l n="8">Changest thy count'nance , and thy hand , with no regard</l>
     <l n="9">Of highest favours past</l>
     <l n="10">From thee on them , or them to thee of service .</l>
     <l n="11">. . . . .</l>
     <l n="12">So deal not with this once thy glorious champion !</l>
     <l n="13">What do I beg ? How hast thou dealt already !</l>
     <l n="14">Behold him in this state calamitous , and turn</l>
     <l n="15">His labours , for thou canst , to peaceful end !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It was on the 23rd of April , 1794 , in one of those melancholy mornings , when his kind and affectionate relation , Lady Hesketh , and Hayley , were watching together over this dejected sufferer , that a letter from Lord Spencer arrived at Weston , to announce the intended grant of a pension from his Majesty to Cowper , of 300l . per annum , rendered payable to his friend Mr. Rose , as the trustee of Cowper . This intelligence produced in the friends of the poet very lively emotions of delight , yet blended with pain almost as powerful ; for it was painful , in no trifling degree , to reflect that these desirable smiles of good fortune could not impart even a faint glimmering of joy to the dejected poet .</p>
   <p>From the time when Hayley left his unhappy friend at Weston , in the spring of the year 1794 , he remained there under the tender vigilance of Lady Hesketh , till the latter end of July , 1795 : a long season of the darkest depression ! in which the best medical advice and the influence of time appeared equally unable to lighten that afflictive burthen which pressed incessantly on his spirits .</p>
   <p>It was under these circumstances that my revered brother-in-law , with a generous disinterestedness and affection that must ever endear him to the admirers of Cowper , determined , with Lady Hesketh 's concurrence , to remove the poet and his afflicted companion into Norfolk . In adopting this plan , he did not contemplate more than a year 's absence from Weston : but what was intended to be only temporary , proved in the sequel to be a final removal .</p>
   <p>Few events could have been more painful to Cowper than a separation from his beloved Weston . Every object was familiar to his eye , and had long engaged the affections of his heart . Its beautiful scenery had been traced with all the minuteness of description and the glow of poetic fancy . The slow-winding Ouse , “ bashful , yet impatient to be seen , ” was henceforth to glide “ in its sinuous course ” unperceived . The spacious meads , the lengthened colonnade , the proud alcove , and the sound of the sweet village-bells — these memorials of past happy days were to be seen and heard no more . All have felt the pang excited by the separation or loss of friends ; but who has not also experienced that even trees have tongues , and that every object in nature knows how to plead its empire over the heart ?</p>
   <p>What Cowper 's sensations were on this occasion , may be collected from the following little incident .</p>
   <p>On the morning of his departure from Weston , he wrote the following lines in pencil on the back of the shutter , in his bed-room .</p>
   <p>“ Farewell , dear scenes , for ever closed to me ! Oh ! for what sorrows must I now exchange you ! ”</p>
   <p>These lines have been carefully preserved as the expressive memorial of his feelings on leaving Weston . Nor can the following little poem fail to excite interest , not only as being the last original production which he composed at Weston , but from its deep and unaffected pathos . It is addressed to Mrs. Unwin . No language can exhibit a specimen of verse more exquisitely tender .</p>

   <p>On Tuesday , the twenty-eighth of July , 1795 , Cowper and Mrs. Unwin removed , under the care and guidance of Mr. Johnson , from Weston to North-Tuddenham , in Norfolk , by a journey of three days , passing through Cambridge without stopping there . In the evening of the first day they rested at the village of Eaton , near St. Neot 's . Cowper walked with his young kinsman in the churchyard by moonlight , and spoke with much composure on the subject of Thomson 's Seasons , and the circumstances under which they were probably written . This conversation was almost his last glimmering of cheerfulness .</p>
   <p>At North-Tuddenham the travellers were accommodated with a commodious , untenanted parsonage-house , by the kindness of the Rev . Leonard Shelford . Here they resided till the nineteenth of August . It was the considerate intention of Mr. Johnson not to remove them immediately to his own house , in the town of East-Dereham , lest the situation in a market-place should be distressing to the tender spirits of Cowper .</p>
   <p>In their new temporary residence they were received by Miss Johnson and Miss Perowne , whose gentle and sympathizing spirit peculiarly qualified them to discharge so delicate an office , and to alleviate the sufferings of the dejected poet .</p>
   <p>Severe as his depressive malady appeared at this period , he was still able to bear considerable exercise , and , before he left Tuddenham , he walked with Mr. Johnson to the neighbouring village of Mattishall , on a visit to his cousin , Mrs. Bodham . On surveying his own portrait by Abbot , in the house of that lady , he clasped his hands in a paroxysm of pain , and uttered a vehement wish , that his present sensations might be such as they were when that picture was painted .</p>
   <p>In August 1795 , Mr. Johnson conducted his two invalids to Mundsley , a village on the Norfolk coast , in the hope that a situation by the sea-side might prove salutary and amusing to Cowper . They continued to reside there till October , but without any apparent benefit to the health of the interesting sufferer .</p>
   <p>He had long relinquished epistolary intercourse with his most intimate friends , but his tender solicitude to hear some tidings of his favourite Weston induced him , in September , to write a letter to Mr. Buchanan . It shows the severity of his depression , but proves also that transient gleams of pleasure could occasionally break through the brooding darkness of melancholy .</p>
   <p>He begins with a poetical quotation :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ To interpose a little ease ,</l>
     <l n="2">Let my frail thoughts dally with false surmise ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ I will forget , for a moment , that to whomsoever I may address myself , a letter from me can no otherwise be welcome than as a curiosity . To you , sir , I address this ; urged to it by extreme penury of employment , and the desire I feel to learn something of what is doing , and has been done , at Weston , ( my beloved Weston ! ) since I left it .</p>
   <p>“ The coldness of these blasts , even in the hottest days , has been such , that , added to the irritation of the salt-spray , with which they are always charged , they have occasioned me an inflammation in the eye-lids , which threatened a few days since to confine me entirely , but , by absenting myself as much as possible from the beach , and guarding my face with an umbrella , that inconvenience is in some degree abated . My chamber commands a very near view of the ocean , and the ships at high water approach the coast so closely , that a man furnished with better eyes than mine might , I doubt not , discern the sailors from the window . No situation , at least when the weather is clear and bright , can be pleasanter ; which you will easily credit , when I add , that it imparts something a little resembling pleasure even to me .— Gratify me with news of Weston ! If Mr. Gregson , and your neighbours the Courtenays are there , mention me to them in such terms as you see good . Tell me if my poor birds are living ! I never see the herbs I used to give them , without a recollection of them , and sometimes am ready to gather them , forgetting that I am not at home . Pardon this intrusion !</p>
   <p>“ Mrs. Unwin continues much as usual .</p>
   <p>“ Mundsley , Sept. 5 , 1795 . ”</p>
   <p>Mr. Buchanan endeavoured , with great tenderness and ingenuity , to allure his dejected friend to prolong a correspondence , that seemed to promise some little alleviation to his melancholy ; but this distressing malady baffled all the various expedients that could be devised to counteract its overwhelming influence .</p>
   <p>Much hope was entertained from air and exercise , with a frequent change of scene .— In September , Mr. Johnson conducted his kinsman ( to the promotion of whose recovery he devoted his most unwearied efforts ) to take a survey of Dunham-Lodge , a seat at that time vacant ; it is situated on high ground , in a park , about four miles from Swaffham . Cowper spoke of it as a house rather too spacious for him , yet such as he was not unwilling to inhabit — a remark which induced Mr. Johnson , at a subsequent period , to become the tenant of this mansion , as a scene more eligible for Cowper than the town of Dereham .— This town they also surveyed in their excursion ; and , after passing a night there , returned to Mundsley , which they quitted for the season on the seventh of October .</p>
   <p>They removed immediately to Dereham ; but left it in the course of a month for Dunham-Lodge , which now became their settled residence .</p>
   <p>The spirits of Cowper were not sufficiently revived to allow him to resume either his pen or his books ; but the kindness of his young kinsman continued to furnish him with inexhaustible amusement , by reading to him almost incessantly ; and , although he was not led to converse on what he heard , yet it failed not to rivet his attention , and so to prevent his afflicted mind from preying on itself .</p>
   <p>In April , 1796 , Mrs. Unwin , whose infirmities continued to engage the tender attention of Cowper , even in his darkest periods of depression , received a visit from her daughter and son-in-law , Mr. and Mrs. Powley . On their departure , Mr. Johnson assumed the office which Mrs. Powley had tenderly performed for her venerable parent , and regularly read a chapter in the Bible every morning to Mrs. Unwin before she rose . It was the invariable custom of Cowper to visit his poor old friend the moment he had finished his breakfast , and to remain in her apartment while the chapter was read .</p>
   <p>In June , the pressure of his melancholy appeared in some degree alleviated , for , on Mr. Johnson 's receiving the edition of Pope 's Homer , published by Wakefield , Cowper eagerly seized the book , and began to read the notes to himself with visible interest . They awakened his attention to his own version of Homer . In August he deliberately engaged in a revisal of the whole , and for some time produced almost sixty new lines a day .</p>
   <p>This mental occupation animated all his intimate friends with a most lively hope of his progressive recovery . But autumn repressed the hope that summer had excited .</p>
   <p>In September the family removed from Dunham-Lodge to try again the influence of the sea-side , in their favourite village of Mundsley .</p>
   <p>Cowper walked frequently by the sea ; but no apparent benefit arose , no mild relief from the incessant pressure of melancholy . He had relinquished his Homer again , and could not yet be induced to resume it .</p>
   <p>Towards the end of October , this interesting party retired from the coast to the house of Mr. Johnson , in Dereham — a house now chosen for their winter residence , as Dunham-Lodge appeared to them too dreary .</p>
   <p>The long and exemplary life of Mrs. Unwin was drawing towards a close :— the powers of nature were gradually exhausted , and on the seventeenth of December she ended a troubled existence , distinguished by a sublime spirit of piety and friendship , that shone through long periods of calamity , and continued to glimmer through the distressful twilight of her declining faculties . Her death was calm and tranquil . Cowper saw her about half an hour before the moment of expiration , which passed without a struggle or a groan , as the clock was striking one in the afternoon .</p>
   <p>On the morning of that day , he said to the servant who opened the window of his chamber , “ Sally , is there life above stairs ? ” A striking proof of his bestowing incessant attention on the sufferings of his aged friend , although he had long appeared almost totally absorbed in his own .</p>
   <p>In the dusk of the evening he attended Mr. Johnson to survey the corpse ; and after looking at it a very few moments he started suddenly away , with a vehement but unfinished sentence of passionate sorrow . He spoke of her no more .</p>
   <p>She was buried by torch-light , on the twenty-third of December , in the north aisle of Dereham church ; and two of her friends , impressed with a just and deep sense of her extraordinary merit , have raised a marble tablet to her memory with the following inscription :</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IN MEMORY OF MARY ,</head>
    <head>WIDOW OF THE REV . MORLEY UNWIN , AND MOTHER OF THE REV . WILLIAM CAWTHORN UNWIN , BORN AT ELY , 1724 . BURIED IN THIS CHURCH 1796 .</head>
     <l n="1">Trusting in God , with all her heart and mind</l>
     <l n="2">This woman prov 'd magnanimously kind ;</l>
     <l n="3">Endur 'd affliction 's desolating hail ,</l>
     <l n="4">And watch 'd a poet thro ’ misfortune 's vale .</l>
     <l n="5">Her spotless dust , angelic guards , defend !</l>
     <l n="6">It is the dust of Unwin , Cowper 's friend !</l>
     <l n="7">That single title in itself is fame ,</l>
     <l n="8">For all who read his verse revere her name .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It might have been anticipated that the death of Mrs. Unwin , in Cowper 's enfeebled state , would have proved too severe a shock to his agitated nerves . But it is mercifully ordained that , while declining years incapacitate us for trials , they , at the same time , weaken the sensibility to suffering , and thereby render us less accessible to the influence of sorrow . It may be regarded as an instance of providential mercy to this afflicted poet , that his aged friend , whose life he had so long considered as essential to his own , was taken from him at a time when the pressure of his malady , a perpetual low fever , both of body and mind , had , in a great degree , diminished the native energy of his faculties and affections .</p>
   <p>Owing to these causes , Cowper was so far preserved in this season of trial , that , instead of mourning the loss of a person in whose life he had seemed to live , all perception of that loss was mercifully taken from him ; and , from the moment when he hurried away from the inanimate object of his filial attachment , he appeared to have no memory of her having existed , for he never asked a question concerning her funeral , nor ever mentioned her name .</p>
   <p>Towards the summer of 1797 , his bodily health appeared to improve , but not to such a degree as to restore any comfortable activity to his mind . In June he wrote a brief letter to Hayley , but such as too forcibly expressed the cruelty of his distemper .</p>
   <p>The process of digestion never passed regularly in his frame during the years that he resided in Norfolk . Medicine appeared to have little or no influence on his complaint , and his aversion at the sight of it was extreme .</p>
   <p>From asses ’ milk , of which he began a course on the twenty-first of June in this year , he gained a considerable acquisition of bodily strength , and was enabled to bear an airing in an open carriage , before breakfast , with Mr. Johnson .</p>
   <p>A depression of mind , which suspended the studies of a writer so eminently endeared to the public , was considered by men of piety and learning as a national misfortune , and several individuals of this description , though personally unknown to Cowper , wrote to him in the benevolent hope that expressions of friendly praise , from persons who could be influenced only by the most laudable motives in bestowing it , might re-animate his dejected spirit . Among these might be enumerated Dr. Watson , the Bishop of Llandaff , who kindly addressed him in the language of encouragement and of soothing consolation ; but the pressure of his malady had now made him utterly deaf to the most honourable praise .</p>
   <p>He had long discontinued the revisal of his Homer , when his kinsman , dreading the effect of the cessation of bodily exercise upon his mind during a long winter , resolved , if possible , to engage him in the revisal of this work . One morning , therefore , after breakfast , in the month of September , he placed the Commentators on the table , one by one ; namely , Villoison , Barnes , and Clarke , opening them all , together with the poet 's translation , at the place where he had left off a twelvemonth before , but talking with him , as he paced the room upon a very different subject , namely , the impossibility of the things befalling him which his imagination had represented ; when , as his companion had wished , he said to him , “ And are you sure that I shall be here till the book you are reading is finished ? ” “ Quite sure , ” replied his kinsman , “ and that you will also be here to complete the revisal of your Homer , ” pointing to the books , “ if you will resume it to-day . ” As he repeated these words he left the room , rejoicing in the well-known token of their having sunk into the poet 's mind , namely , his seating himself on the sofa , taking up one of the books , and saying in a low and plaintive voice , “ I may as well do this , for I can do nothing else . "[ 741 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 741 ]</span>Sketch of the Life of Cowper .</p>
   <p>In this labour he persevered , oppressed as he was by indisposition , till March 1799 . On Friday evening , the eighth of that month , he completed his revisal of the Odyssey , and the next morning wrote part of a new preface .</p>
   <p>To watch over the disordered health of afflicted genius , and to lead a powerful , but oppressed , spirit by gentle encouragement , to exert itself in salutary occupation , is an office that requires a very rare union of tenderness , intelligence , and fortitude . To contemplate and minister to a great mind , in a state that borders on mental desolation , is like surveying , in the midst of a desert , the tottering ruins of palaces and temples , where the faculties of the spectator are almost absorbed in wonder and regret , and where every step is taken with awful apprehension .</p>
   <p>Hayley , in alluding to Dr. Johnson 's kind and affectionate offices , at this period , bears the following honourable testimony to his merits , which we are happy in transcribing . “ It seemed as if Providence had expressly formed the young kinsman of Cowper to prove exactly such a guardian to his declining years as the peculiar exigencies of his situation required . I never saw the human being that could , I think , have sustained the delicate and arduous office ( in which the inexhaustible virtues of Mr. Johnson persevered to the last ) through a period so long , with an equal portion of unvaried tenderness and unshaken fidelity . A man who wanted sensibility would have renounced the duty ; and a man endowed with a particle too much of that valuable , though perilous , quality , must have felt his own health utterly undermined , by an excess of sympathy with the sufferings perpetually in his sight . Mr. Johnson has completely discharged , perhaps , the most trying of human duties ; and I trust he will forgive me for this public declaration , that , in his mode of discharging it , he has merited the most cordial esteem from all , who love the memory of Cowper . Even a stranger may consider it as a strong proof of his tender dexterity in soothing and guiding the afflicted poet , that he was able to engage him steadily to pursue and finish the revisal and correction of his Homer , during a long period of bodily and mental sufferings , when his troubled mind recoiled from all intercourse with his most intimate friends , and laboured under a morbid abhorrence of all cheerful exertion . ”</p>
   <p>In the summer of 1798 , his kinsman was induced to vary his plan of remaining for some months in the marine village of Mundsley , and thought it more eligible to make frequent visits from Dereham to the coast , passing a week at a time by the sea-side .</p>
   <p>Cowper , in his poem on “ Retirement , ” seems to inform us what his own sentiments were , in a season of health , concerning the regimen most proper for the disease of melancholy .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Virtuous and faithful Heberden , whose skill</l>
     <l n="2">Attempts no task it cannot well fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="3">Gives melancholy up to nature 's care ,</l>
     <l n="4">And sends the patient into purer air .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The frequent change of place , and the magnificence of marine scenery , produced at times a little relief to his depressed spirits . On the 7th of June 1798 , he surveyed the light-house at Happisburgh , and expressed some pleasure on beholding , through a telescope , several ships at a distance . Yet , in his usual walk with his companion by the sea-side , he exemplified but too forcibly his own affecting description of melancholy silence :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">That silent tongue</l>
     <l n="2">Could give advice , could censure , or commend ,</l>
     <l n="3">Or charm the sorrows of a drooping friend ;</l>
     <l n="4">Renounc 'd alike its office and its sport ,</l>
     <l n="5">Its brisker and its graver strains fall short :</l>
     <l n="6">Both fail beneath a fever 's secret sway ,</l>
     <l n="7">And , like a summer-brook , are past away .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>On the twenty-fourth of July , Cowper had the honour of a visit from a lady , for whom he had long entertained affectionate respect , the Dowager Lady Spencer — and it was rather remarkable , that on the very morning she called upon him he had begun his revisal of the Odyssey , which was originally inscribed to her . Such an incident in a happier season would have produced a very enlivening effect on his spirits : but , in his present state , it had not even the power to lead him into any free conversation with his distinguished visitor .</p>
   <p>The only amusement that he appeared to admit without reluctance was the reading of his kinsman , who , indefatigable in the supply of such amusement , had exhausted a successive series of works of fiction , and at this period began reading to the poet his own works . To these he listened also in silence , and heard all his poems recited in order , till the reader arrived at the history of John Gilpin , which he begged not to hear . Mr. Johnson proceeded to his manuscript poems ; to these he willingly listened , but made not a single remark on any .</p>
   <p>In October 1798 , the pressure of his melancholy seemed to be mitigated in some little degree , for he exerted himself so far as to write the following letter , without solicitation , to Lady Hesketh .</p>
   <p>Dear Cousin ,— You describe delightful scenes , but you describe them to one , who , if he even saw them , could receive no delight from them : who has a faint recollection , and so faint , as to be like an almost forgotten dream , that once he was susceptible of pleasure from such causes . The country that you have had in prospect has been always famed for its beauties ; but the wretch who can derive no gratification from a view of nature , even under the disadvantage of her most ordinary dress , will have no eyes to admire her in any .</p>
   <p>In one day , in one minute , I should rather have said , she became an universal blank to me , and though from a different cause , yet with an effect as difficult to remove as blindness itself .</p>
   <p>. . . . . . .</p>
   <p>Mundsley , Oct. 13 , 1798 .</p>
   <p>On his return from Mundsley to Dereham , in an evening towards the end of October , Cowper , with Miss Perowne and Mr. Johnson , was overturned in a post-chaise : he discovered no terror on the occasion , and escaped without injury from the accident .</p>
   <p>In December he received a visit from his highly esteemed friend , Sir John Throckmorton , but his malady was at that time so oppressive that it rendered him almost insensible to the kind solicitude of friendship .</p>
   <p>He still continued to exercise the powers of his astonishing mind : upon his finishing the revisal of his Homer , in March , 1799 , his kinsman endeavoured in the gentlest manner to lead him into new literary occupation .</p>
   <p>For this purpose , on the eleventh of March he laid before him the paper containing the comencement of his poem on “ The Four Ages . ” Cowper altered a few lines ; he also added a few , but soon observed to his kind attendant — “ that it was too great a work for him to attempt in his present situation . ”</p>
   <p>At supper Mr. Johnson suggested to him several literary projects that he might execute more easily . He replied — “ that he had just thought of six Latin verses , and if he could compose anything it must be in pursuing that composition . ”</p>
   <p>The next morning he wrote the six verses he had mentioned , and subsequently added the remainder , entitling the poem , “ Montes Glaciales . ”</p>
   <p>It proved a versification of a circumstance recorded in a newspaper , which had been read to him a few weeks before , without his appearing to notice it . This poem he translated into English verse , on the nineteenth of March , to oblige Miss Perowne . Both the original and the translation appear in the Poems .</p>
   <p>On the twentieth of March he wrote the stanzas entitled “ The Cast-away , ” founded on an anecdote in Anson 's Voyage , which his memory suggested to him , although he had not looked into the book for many years .</p>
   <p>As this poem is the last original production from the pen of Cowper , we shall introduce it here , persuaded that it will be read with an interest proportioned to the extraordinary pathos of the subject , and the still more extraordinary powers of the poet , whose lyre could sound so forcibly , unsilenced by the gloom of the darkest distemper , that was conducting him , by slow gradations , to the shadow of death .</p>

   <p>In August he translated this poem into Latin verse . In October he went with Miss Perowne and Mr. Johnson to survey a larger house in Dereham , which he preferred to their present residence , and in which the family were settled in the following December .</p>
   <p>Though his corporeal strength was now evidently declining , the urgent persuasion of his kinsman induced him to amuse his mind with frequent composition . Between August and December , he wrote all the translations from various Latin and Greek epigrams , which the reader will find in the present volume .</p>
   <p>In his new residence , he amused himself with translating a few fables of Gay 's into Latin verse . The fable which he used to recite when a child — “ The Hare and many Friends ” — became one of his latest amusements .</p>
   <p>These Latin fables were all written in January 1800 . Towards the end of that month , Hayley requested him to new-model a passage in his Homer , relating to the curious monument of ancient sculpture , so gracefully described by Homer , called the Cretan Dance . This being the last effort of his pen , and the passage being interesting , as a representation of ancient manners , we here insert it .</p>

   <p>On the very day that this endearing mark of his kindness reached Hayley , a dropsical appearance in his legs induced Mr. Johnson to have recourse to fresh medical assistance . Cowper was with great difficulty persuaded to take the remedies prescribed , and to try the exercise of a post-chaise , an exercise which he could not bear beyond the twenty-second of February .</p>
   <p>In March , when his decline became more and more visible , he was visited by Mr. Rose . He hardly expressed any pleasure on the arrival of a friend whom he had so long and so tenderly regarded , yet he showed evident signs of regret at his departure , on the sixth of April .</p>
   <p>The illness and impending death of his talented son precluded Hayley from sharing with Mr. Rose in these last marks of affectionate attention towards the man , whose genius and virtues they had once contemplated together with mutual veneration and delight ; whose approaching dissolution they felt , not only as an irreparable loss to themselves , but as a national misfortune . On the nineteenth of April , Dr. Johnson remarks , the weakness of this truly pitiable sufferer had so much increased , that his kinsman apprehended his death to be near . Adverting , therefore , to the affliction , as well of body as of mind , which his beloved inmate was then enduring , he ventured to speak of his approaching dissolution as the signal of his deliverance from both these miseries . After a pause of a few moments , which was less interrupted by the objections of his desponding relative than he had dared to hope , he proceeded to an observation more consolatory still ; namely , that , in the world to which he was hastening , a merciful Redeemer had prepared unspeakable happiness for all his children — and therefore for him . To the first part of this sentence , he had listened with composure , but the concluding words were no sooner uttered , than his passionately expressed entreaties , that his companion would desist from any further observations of a similar kind , clearly proved that , though it was on the eve of being invested with angelic light , the darkness of delusion still veiled his spirit .<span type="note_anchor">[ 742 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 742 ]</span>Sketch of the Life of Cowper , by Dr. Johnson .</p>
   <p>On Sunday , the twentieth , he seemed a little revived .</p>
   <p>On Monday he appeared dying , but recovered so much as to eat a slight dinner .</p>
   <p>Tuesday and Wednesday he grew apparently weaker every hour .</p>
   <p>On Thursday he sat up as usual in the evening .</p>
   <p>In the course of the night , when exceedingly exhausted , Miss Perowne offered him some refreshment . He rejected it with these words , the very last that he was heard to utter , “ What can it signify ? ”</p>
   <p>Dr. Johnson closes the affecting account in the following words .</p>
   <p>“ At five in the morning of Friday 25th , a deadly change in his features was observed to take place . He remained in an insensible state from that time till about five minutes before five in the afternoon , when he ceased to breathe . And in so mild and gentle a manner did his spirit take its flight , that though the writer of this Memoir , his medical attendant Mr. Woods , and three other persons , were standing at the foot and side of the bed , with their eyes fixed upon his dying countenance , the precise moment of his departure was unobserved by any . ”</p>
   <p>From this mournful period , till the features of his deceased friend were closed from his view , the expression which the kinsman of Cowper observed in them , and which he was affectionately delighted to suppose “ an index of the last thoughts and enjoyments of his soul , in its gradual escape from the depths of despondence , was that of calmness and composure , mingled , as it were , with holy surprise . ”</p>
   <p>He was buried in St. Edmund 's Chapel , in the church of East Dereham , on Saturday , May 2nd , attended by several of his relations .</p>
   <p>He left a will , but without appointing his executor . The administration , therefore , of the little property he possessed devolved on his affectionate relative , Lady Hesketh ; but not having been carried into effect by that Lady , the office , on her decease , was undertaken by his cousin german , Mrs. Bodham .</p>
   <p>Lady Hesketh raised a marble tablet to his memory , with the following inscription from the pen of Hayley :</p>
   <p>IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM COWPER , ESQ . BORN IN HERTFORDSHIRE , 1731 , BURIED IN THIS CHURCH .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Ye , who with warmth the public triumph feel</l>
     <l n="2">Of talents , dignified by sacred zeal ,</l>
     <l n="3">Here , to devotion 's bard devoutly just ,</l>
     <l n="4">Pay your fond tribute due to Cowper 's dust !</l>
     <l n="5">England , exulting in his spotless fame ,</l>
     <l n="6">Ranks with her dearest sons his favourite name .</l>
     <l n="7">Sense , fancy , wit , suffice not all to raise</l>
     <l n="8">So clear a title to affection 's praise ;</l>
     <l n="9">His highest honours to the heart belong ;</l>
     <l n="10">His virtues form 'd the magic of his song .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>We have now conducted the endeared subject of this biography through the various scenes of his chequered and eventful life , till its last solemn termination ; and it is impossible that any other feelings can have been awakened than those of admiration for his genius , homage for his virtues , and profound sympathy for his sufferings . It was fully anticipated by his friends , that the hour of final liberation , at least , would have been cheered by that calm sense of the divine presence , which is the delightful foretaste of eternal rest and glory . Young beautifully observes :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The chamber where the good man meets his fate</l>
     <l n="2">Is privileged beyond the common walk</l>
     <l n="3">Of virtuous life , quite on the verge of heaven .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Bible proclaims the same animating truth . “ Mark the perfect man , and behold the upright , for the end of that man is peace ! ” The divine faithfulness is an ample security for the fulfilment of these declarations ; but the promises of God , firm and unchangeable as they are in themselves , after all , can be realized only in a mind disposed for their reception ; as the light cannot pass through a medium that is incapable of admitting it . Such , alas ! is the influence of physical causes and of a morbid temperament on the inward perceptions of the soul , that it is possible to be a child of God , without a consciousness of the blessing , and to have a title to a crown , and yet feel to be immured in the depths of a dungeon .</p>
   <p>The consolation to the friends of the unhappy sufferer , if not to the patient himself , is , that the chains are of his own forging , and that , if he had but the discernment to know it , the delusion would promptly vanish , and the peace of God flow into the soul like a river .</p>
   <p>That such was the case with Cowper , no one can doubt for a moment . A species of mental aberration , on a particular subject , involved his mind in a strange and sad delusion . The Sun of Righteousness , therefore , failed in his last moments to impart its refreshing light and comfort , because the cloud of despair intervened , and obscured the setting beams of grace and glory .</p>
   <p>Who can contemplate so mysterious a process of the mind , without exclaiming —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">How poor , how rich , how abject , how august ,</l>
     <l n="2">How complicate , how wonderful is man !</l>
     <l n="3">How passing wonder He , who made him such !</l>
     <l n="4">Who centred in our make such strange extremes !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is impossible to dwell on the manner of Cowper 's death , and not to be reminded of the wish cherished by himself on this subject , and recorded so impressively in the following lines :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">So life glides smoothly and by stealth away ,</l>
     <l n="2">More golden than that age of fabled gold</l>
     <l n="3">Renowned in ancient song ; not vex 'd with care ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or stained with guilt , beneficent , approved</l>
     <l n="5">Of God and man , and peaceful in its end .</l>
     <l n="6">So glide my life away ! and so , at last ,</l>
     <l n="7">My share of duties decently fulfill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="8">May some disease , not tardy to perform</l>
     <l n="9">Its destined office , yet with gentle stroke ,</l>
     <l n="10">Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat ,</l>
     <l n="11">Beneath the turf that I have often trod .<span type="note_anchor">[ 743 ]</span></l>

   <p>God mercifully granted the best portion of his prayer , but saw fit to deny the rest . No conscious guilt or open transgression stained his life ; his heart was the seat of every beneficent and kind affection . As an author , he was blessed with an honourable career of usefulness ; the public voice conferred upon him the title to immortality , and succeeding times have ratified the claim . But if perception be necessary to enjoyment , he was not “ peaceful in his end ; ” for he died without this conviction . He did not , like Elijah , ascend in a chariot of fire ; it was his lot rather to realize the quaint remark of some of the old divines , “ God sometimes puts his children to bed in the dark , ” that they may have nothing whereof to boast ; that their salvation may appear to be more fully the result of his own free and unmerited mercy , and that in this , as in all things , he may be known to act as a sovereign , who “ giveth no account of his matters . "[ 744 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 744 ]</span>Job xxxiii . 13 .</p>
   <p>But the severest exercises of faith are always mingled with some gracious purpose ; and God may perhaps see fit to appoint these dark dispensations , that the transition into eternity may be more glorious ; and that the emancipated spirit , bursting the shackles of death and sin , and delivered from the bondage of its fears , may rise with a nobler triumph from the depths of humiliation into the very presence-chamber of its God .</p>
   <p>These remarks are so closely connected with the subject of Cowper 's afflicting malady , that the time is now arrived when it is necessary to enter into a more detailed view of its nature and character ; to trace its origin and progress , and to disengage this complicated question from that prejudice and misrepresentation which have so inveterately attached to it . At the same time , it is with profound reluctance that the Editor enters upon this painful theme , from a deep conviction that it does not form a proper subject for discussion , and that the veil of secrecy is never more suitably employed , than when it is thrown over infirmities which are too sacred to meet the gaze of public observation . This inquiry is now , however , no longer optional . Cowper himself has , unfortunately , suffered in the public estimation by the manner in which his earliest biographer , Hayley , has presented him before the public . By suppressing some very important letters , which tended to elucidate his real character , an air of mystery has been imparted which deeply affects its consistency ; while , by attributing what he could not sufficiently conceal of the malady of the poet to the operation of religious causes , truth has been violated , and an unmerited wound inflicted upon religion itself . Thus Hayley , from motives of delicacy most probably , or from misapprehension of the subject , has committed a double error ; while others , misled by his authority , have unhappily aided in propagating the delusion .</p>
   <p>The Private Correspondence of Cowper , which is exclusively incorporated with the present edition , is of the first importance , as it dispels the mystery previously attached to his character . All that now remains is , to establish by undeniable evidence that , so far from religious causes having been instrumental to his malady , the order of events and the testimony of positive facts both militate against such a conclusion .</p>
   <p>For this purpose , we shall now introduce to the notice of the reader , copious extracts from the Memoir of Cowper , written by himself , containing the particulars of his life , from his earliest years to the period of his malady and subsequent recovery . This remarkable document was intended to record his sense of the Divine mercy in the preservation of his life , during a season of disastrous feeling ; and to perpetuate the remembrance of that grace which overruled this event , in so remarkable a manner , to his best and eternal interests . He designed this document principally for the perusal of Mrs. Unwin , to whose hands it was most confidentially entrusted . A copy was also presented to Mr. Newton , and ultimately to Dr. Johnson ; but the parties were strictly enjoined never to allow another copy to be taken . By some means the Memoir at length found its way before the public . On this ground the editor feels less difficulty in communicating its purport ; as the seal of secrecy has been already broken , though in the estimation of Dr. Johnson and his friends , in so unauthorized a manner . Its publication , however , has been unquestionably attended by one beneficial result , in having established , beyond the possibility of contradiction , that so far from Cowper 's religious views having been the source of his malady , they were the first occasion and instrument of its cure .<span type="note_anchor">[ 745 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 745 ]</span>The following is the result of the information obtained by the Editor on this subject , after the minutest inquiry . A lady who was on a visit at Mr. Newton 's , in London , saw , it is said , this Memoir of Cowper lying , among other papers , on the table . She was led to peruse it , and felt a deeper interest in the contents , from having herself been recently recovered from a state of derangement . She privately copied the manuscript , and communicated it to some friend . It was finally published by a pious character , who considered that in so doing he exonerated the religious views of Cowper from the charge of having been instrumental to his malady .</p>
   <p>The Memoir is interesting in another respect . It elucidates the early events of Cowper 's history . One important subject is however omitted , his attachment to Miss Theodora Cowper , the failure of which formed no small ingredient in the disappointments of his early life . This omission we shall be enabled to supply .</p>
   <p>With these preliminary remarks we shall now introduce this curious and remarkable document , simply suppressing those portions which violate the feelings , without being essential to the substance of the narrative .</p>
   <p>MEMOIR OF THE EARLY LIFE OF WILLIAM COWPER , ESQ .</p>
   <p>WRITTEN BY HIMSELF .</p>
   <p>I cannot recollect , that , till the month of December , in the thirty-second year of my life , I had ever any serious impressions of the religious kind , or at all bethought myself of the things of my salvation , except in two or three instances . The first was of so transitory a nature , and passed when I was so very young , that , did I not intend what follows for a history of my heart , so far as religion has been its object , I should hardly mention it .</p>
   <p>At six years old , I was taken from the nursery , and from the immediate care of a most indulgent mother , and sent to a considerable school in Bedfordshire .<span type="note_anchor">[ 746 ]</span>Here I had hardships of different kinds to conflict with , which I felt more sensibly in proportion to the tenderness with which I had been treated at home . But my chief affliction consisted in my being singled out from all the other boys , by a lad about fifteen years of age , as a proper object upon whom he might let loose the cruelty of his temper . I choose to forbear a particular recital of the many acts of barbarity with which he made it his business continually to persecute me : it will be sufficient to say , that he had , by his savage treatment of me , impressed such a dread of his figure upon my mind , that I well remember being afraid to lift up my eyes upon him , higher than his knees ; and that I knew him by his shoe-buckles better than any other part of his dress . May the Lord pardon him , and may we meet in glory !</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 746 ]</span>Market Street . Hayley places this village in Hertfordshire , and Cowper in Bedfordshire . Both are right , for the public road or street forms a boundary between the two counties .</p>
   <p>One day , as I was sitting alone on a bench in the school , melancholy , and almost ready to weep at the recollection of what I had already suffered , and expecting at the same time my tormentor every moment , these words of the Psalmist came into my mind , “ I will not be afraid of what man can do unto me . ” I applied this to my own case , with a degree of trust and confidence in God that would have been no disgrace to a much more experienced Christian . Instantly I perceived in myself a briskness of spirits , and a cheerfulness , which I had never before experienced ,— and took several paces up and down the room with joyful alacrity — his gift in whom I trusted . Happy had it been for me , if this early effort towards a dependence on the blessed God had been frequently repeated by me . But , alas ! it was the first and last instance of the kind between infancy and manhood . The cruelty of this boy , which he had long practised in so secret a manner that no creature suspected it , was at length discovered . He was expelled from the school , and I was taken from it .</p>
   <p>From hence , at eight years old , I was sent to Mr. D ., an eminent surgeon and oculist , having very weak eyes , and being in danger of losing one of them . I continued a year in this family , where religion was neither known nor practised ; and from thence was despatched to Westminster . Whatever seeds of religion I might carry thither , before my seven years ’ apprenticeship to the classics was expired , they were all marred and corrupted ; the duty of the school-boy swallowed up every other ; and I acquired Latin and Greek at the expense of a knowledge much more important .<span type="note_anchor">[ 747 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 747 ]</span>We deeply lament that boys frequently leave public schools most discreditably deficient even in the common principles of the Christian faith . My late lamented friend , the Rev . Legh Richmond , used to observe that Christ was crucified between classics and mathematics . A great improvement might be effected in the system of modern education , if a brief but compendious summary of divine truth , or analysis of the Bible , were drawn up , divided into parts , suited to the different gradations of age and knowledge , and introduced into our public schools under the sanction of the Episcopal Bench . Care should also be taken , in the selection of under-masters , to appoint men of acknowledged religious as well as classical attainments , who might specially superintend the religious improvement of the boys . Such are to be found in our Universities , men not less eminent for divine than profane knowledge . A visible reformation would thus be effected , powerfully operating on the moral and spiritual character of the rising generation .</p>
   <p>Here occurred the second instance of serious consideration . As I was crossing St. Margaret 's churchyard , late one evening , I saw a glimmering light in the midst of it , which excited my curiosity . Just as I arrived at the spot , a grave-digger , who was at work by the light of his lanthorn , threw up a skull which struck me upon the leg . This little accident was an alarm to my conscience ; for that event may be numbered among the best religious documents which I received at Westminster . The impression , however , presently went off , and I became so forgetful of mortality , that , strange as it may seem , surveying my activity and strength , and observing the evenness of my pulse , I began to entertain , with no small complacency , a notion that perhaps I might never die ! This notion was , however , very short-lived ; for I was soon after struck with a lowness of spirits , uncommon at my age , and frequently had intimations of a consumptive habit . I had skill enough to understand their meaning , but could never prevail on myself to disclose them to any one ; for I thought any bodily infirmity a disgrace , especially a consumption . This messenger from the Lord , however , did his errand , and perfectly convinced me that I was mortal .</p>
   <p>That I may do justice to the place of my education , I must relate one mark of religious discipline , which , in my time , was observed at Westminster ; I mean , the pains which Dr. Nicholls took to prepare us for confirmation . The old man acquitted himself of his duty like one who had a deep sense of its importance ; and I believe most of us were struck by his manner , and affected by his exhortation . For my own part , I then , for the first time , attempted prayer in secret ; but being little accustomed to that exercise of the heart , and having very childish notions of religion , I found it a difficult and painful task ; and was even then frightened at my own insensibility . This difficulty , though it did not subdue my good purposes , till the ceremony of confirmation was past , soon after entirely conquered them ; I relapsed into a total forgetfulness of God , with the usual disadvantage of being more hardened , for having been softened to no purpose .</p>
   <p>At twelve or thirteen I was seized with the small-pox . I only mention this , to show that , at that early age , my heart was become proof against the ordinary means which a gracious God employs for our chastisement . Though I was severely handled by the disease , and in imminent danger , yet neither in the course of it , nor during my recovery , had I any sentiment of contrition , any thought of God or eternity . On the contrary , I was scarcely raised from the bed of pain and sickness , before the emotions of sin became more violent in me than ever ; and Satan seemed rather to have gained than lost an advantage ; so readily did I admit his suggestions , and so passive was I under them .</p>
   <p>By this time I became such an adept in falsehood that I was seldom guilty of a fault for which I could not , at a very short notice , invent an apology , capable of deceiving the wisest . These , I know , are called school-boys ’ tricks ; but a sad depravity of principle , and the work of the father of lies , are universally at the bottom of them .</p>
   <p>At the age of eighteen , being tolerably furnished with grammatical knowledge , but as ignorant in all points of religion as the satchel at my back , I was taken from Westminster ; and , having spent about nine months at home , was sent to acquire the practice of the law with an attorney . There I might have lived and died without hearing or seeing any thing that might remind me of a single Christian duty , had it not been that I was at liberty to spend my leisure time ( which was well nigh all my time ) at my uncle 's ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 748 ]</span>in Southampton Row . By this means I had indeed an opportunity of seeing the inside of a church , whither I went with the family on Sundays , which probably I should otherwise never have seen .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 748 ]</span>Ashley Cowper , Esq .</p>
   <p>At the expiration of this term , I became , in a manner , complete master of myself ; and took possession of a complete set of chambers in the Temple , at the age of twenty-one . This being a critical season of my life , and one upon which much depended , it pleased my all-merciful Father in Jesus Christ to give a check to my rash and ruinous career of wickedness at the very onset . I was struck , not long after my settlement in the Temple , with such a dejection of spirits , as none but they who have felt the same can have the least conception of . Day and night I was upon the rack , lying down in horror , and rising up in despair .<span type="note_anchor">[ 749 ]</span>I presently lost all relish for those studies to which I had before been closely attached ; the classics had no longer any charms for me ; I had need of something more salutary than amusement , but I had no one to direct me where to find it .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 749 ]</span>Here we first observe the ground-work of Cowper 's malady , originating in constitutional causes , and morbid temperament .</p>
   <p>At length I met with Herbert 's Poems ; and gothic and uncouth as they were , I yet found in them a strain of piety which I could not but admire . This was the only author I had any delight in reading . I pored over him all day long ; and though I found not here , what I might have found , a cure for my malady , yet it never seemed so much alleviated as while I was reading him . At length I was advised by a very near and dear relative , to lay him aside ; for he thought such an author more likely to nourish my disorder than to remove it .<span type="note_anchor">[ 750 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 750 ]</span>A relative of Cowper 's ought to have been the last to prohibit the perusal of Herbert 's Poems , because Dr. John Donne , the pious and eminent Dean of St. Paul 's , one of Cowper 's ancestors , was the endeared friend of that holy man , to whom , not long before his death , he sent a seal , representing a figure of Christ extended upon an anchor , the emblem of Hope , to be kept as a memorial .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Izaak Walton bears the following expressive testimony to</l>
     <l n="2">Herbert 's Temple , or Sacred Poems .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ A book , in which by declaring his own spiritual conflicts , he hath comforted and raised many a dejected and discomposed soul , and charmed them into sweet and quiet thoughts ; a book , by the frequent reading whereof , and the assistance of that Spirit that seemed to inspire the author , the reader may attain habits of peace and piety , and all the gifts of the Holy Ghost and Heaven : and may , by still reading , still keep those sacred fires burning upon the altar of so pure a heart , as shall free it from the anxieties of this world , and keep it fixed upon things that are above . ” See Walton 's Lives .</p>
   <p>In this state of mind I continued near a twelvemonth ; when , having experienced the inefficacy of all human means , I at length betook myself to God in prayer ; such is the rank which our Redeemer holds in our esteem , never resorted to but in the last instance , when all creatures have failed to succour us . My hard heart was at length softened ; and my stubborn knees brought to bow . I composed a set of prayers , and made frequent use of them . Weak as my faith was , the Almighty , who will not break the bruised reed , nor quench the smoking flax , was graciously pleased to hear me .</p>
   <p>A change of scene was recommended to me ; and I embraced an opportunity of going with some friends to Southampton , where I spent several months . Soon after our arrival , we walked to a place called Freemantle , about a mile from the town : the morning was clear and calm ; the sun shone bright upon the sea ; and the country on the borders of it was the most beautiful I had ever seen . We sat down upon an eminence , at the end of the arm of the sea , which runs between Southampton and the New Forest . Here it was , that , on a sudden , as if another sun had been kindled that instant in the heavens , on purpose to dispel sorrow and vexation of spirit , I felt the weight of all my misery taken off ; my heart became light and joyful in a moment ; I could have wept with transport had I been alone . I must needs believe that nothing less than the Almighty fiat could have filled me with such inexpressible delight ; not by a gradual dawning of peace , but as it were with a flash of his life-giving countenance . I think I remember something like a glow of gratitude to the Father of mercies for this unexpected blessing , and that I ascribed it to his gracious acceptance of my prayers . But Satan , and my own wicked heart , quickly persuaded me that I was indebted for my deliverance to nothing but a change of scene and the amusing varieties of the place . By this means he turned the blessing into a poison ; teaching me to conclude , that nothing but a continued circle of diversion , and indulgence of appetite , could secure me from a relapse .<span type="note_anchor">[ 751 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 751 ]</span>We do not know a state of mind more to be deprecated than what is indicated in this passage . It is the science of self-tormenting , that withers every joy , and blights all our happiness . That Satan tempts is a scriptural truth ; but the same divine authority also informs us , that “ every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed , ” James i . 14 : that God suffereth no man to be tempted above what he is able , and that if we resist Satan he will flee from us . The mind that feels itself harassed by these mental temptations must take refuge in the promises of God , such as Isaiah xli . 10 ; xliii . 2 ; lix . 19 ; 2 Cor . xii . 9 , and plead them in prayer . Resistance to temptation will weaken it , faith will overcome it , and the panoply of Heaven , if we be careful to gird ourselves with it , will secure us against all its inroads .</p>
   <p>Upon this false principle , as soon as I returned to London , I burnt my prayers , and away went all thoughts of devotion and dependence upon God my Saviour . Surely it was of his mercy that I was not consumed ; glory be to his grace ! Two deliverances from danger not making any impression , having spent about twelve years in the Temple , in an uninterrupted course of sinful indulgence , and my associates and companions being either , like myself , professed Christians , or professed infidels , I obtained , at length , so complete a victory over my conscience , that all remonstrances from that quarter were in vain , and in a manner silenced ; though sometimes , indeed , a question would arise in my mind , whether it were safe to proceed any farther in a course so plainly and utterly condemned in the word of God . I saw clearly that if the gospel were true , such a conduct must inevitably end in my destruction ; but I saw not by what means I could change my Ethiopian complexion , or overcome such an inveterate habit of rebelling against God .</p>
   <p>The next thing that occurred to me was a doubt whether the gospel were true or false . To this succeeded many an anxious wish for the decision of this important question ; for I foolishly thought , that obedience would presently follow , were I but convinced that it was worth while to attempt it . Having no reason to expect a miracle , and not hoping to be satisfied with any thing less , I acquiesced , at length , in the force of that devilish conclusion , that the only course I could take to secure my present peace was to wink hard against the prospect of future misery , and to resolve to banish all thoughts of a subject , upon which I thought to so little purpose . Nevertheless , when I was in the company of deists , and heard the gospel blasphemed , I never failed to assert the truth of it with much vehemence of disputation ; for which I was the better qualified , having been always an industrious and diligent inquirer into the evidences by which it was externally supported . I think I once went so far into a controversy of this kind , as to assert , that I would gladly submit to have my right hand cut off , so that I might but be enabled to live according to the gospel . Thus have I been employed , when half intoxicated , in vindicating the truth of scripture , while in the very act of rebellion against its dictates . Lamentable inconsistency of a convinced judgment with an unsanctified heart ! An inconsistency , indeed , evident to others as well as to myself , inasmuch as a deistical friend of mine , with whom I was disputing upon the subject , cut short the matter , by alleging that , if what I said were true , I was certainly lost by my own showing .</p>
   <p>By this time , my patrimony being well nigh spent , and there being no appearance that I should ever repair the damage by a fortune of my own getting , I began to be a little apprehensive of approaching want . It was , I imagine , under some apprehensions of this kind , that I one day said to a friend of mine , if the clerk to the journals of the House of Lords should die , I had some hopes that my kinsman , who had the place in his disposal , would appoint me to succeed him . We both agreed that the business of that place , being transacted in private , would exactly suit me . Thus did I covet what God had commanded me not to covet . It pleased the Lord to give me my heart 's desire , and with it an immediate punishment for my crime . The man died , and , by his death , not only the clerkship of the journals became vacant , but it became necessary to appoint officers to two other places , jointly , as deputies to Mr. De Grey ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 752 ]</span>who at this time resigned . These were the office of reading clerk , and the clerkship of the committees , of much greater value than that of the journals . The patentee of these appointments ( whom I pray to God to bless for his benevolent intention to serve me ) called on me at my chambers , and , having invited me to take a turn with him in the garden , there made me an offer of the two most profitable places ; intending the other for his friend Mr. A. Dazzled by so splendid a proposal , and not immediately reflecting upon my incapacity to execute a business of so public a nature , I at once accepted it ; but at the same time ( such was the will of Him whose hand was in the whole matter ) seemed to receive a dagger in my heart . The wound was given , and every moment added to the smart of it . All the considerations , by which I endeavoured to compose my mind to its former tranquillity , did but torment me the more ; proving miserable comforters and counsellors of no value . I returned to my chambers thoughtful and unhappy ; my countenance fell ; and my friend was astonished , instead of that additional cheerfulness he might so reasonably expect , to find an air of deep melancholy in all I said or did .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 752 ]</span>Afterwards Lord Chief Justice , in the Court of Common</l>
     <l n="2">Pleas , and created Lord Walsingham .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Having been harassed in this manner by day and night , for the space of a week , perplexed between the apparent folly of casting away the only visible chance I had of being well provided for and the impossibility of retaining it , I determined at length to write a letter to my friend , though he lodged in a manner at the next door , and we generally spent the day together . I did so , and therein begged him to accept my resignation , and to appoint Mr. A. to the places he had given me ; and permit me to succeed Mr. A. I was well aware of the disproportion between the value of his appointment and mine ; but my peace was gone ; pecuniary advantages were not equivalent to what I had lost ; and I flattered myself , that the clerkship of the journals would fall fairly and easily within the scope of my abilities . Like a man in a fever , I thought a change of posture would relieve my pain ; and , as the event will show , was equally disappointed . At length I carried my point ; my friend , in this instance , preferring the gratification of my desires to his own interest ; for nothing could be so likely to bring a suspicion of bargain and sale upon his nomination , which the Lords would not have endured , as his appointment of so near a relative to the least profitable office , while the most valuable was allotted to a stranger .</p>
   <p>The matter being thus settled , something like a calm took place in my mind . I was , indeed , not a little concerned about my character ; being aware , that it must needs suffer by the strange appearance of my proceeding . This , however , being but a small part of the anxiety I had laboured under , was hardly felt , when the rest was taken off . I thought my path to an easy maintenance was now plain and open , and for a day or two was tolerably cheerful . But , behold , the storm was gathering all the while ; and the fury of it was not the less violent for this gleam of sunshine .</p>
   <p>In the beginning , a strong opposition to my friend 's right of nomination began to show itself . A powerful party was formed among the lords to thwart it , in favour of an old enemy of the family , though one much indebted to its bounty ; and it appeared plain that , if we succeeded at last , it would only be by fighting our ground by inches . Every advantage , I was told , would be sought for , and eagerly seized , to disconcert us . I was bid to expect an examination at the bar of the house , touching my sufficiency for the post I had taken . Being necessarily ignorant of the nature of that business , it became expedient that I should visit the office daily , in order to qualify myself for the strictest scrutiny . All the horror of my fears and perplexities now returned . A thunderbolt would have been as welcome to me as this intelligence . I knew , to demonstration , that upon these terms the clerkship of the journals was no place for me . To require my attendance at the bar of the house , that I might there publicly entitle myself to the office , was , in effect , to exclude me from it . In the meantime , the interest of my friend , the honour of his choice , my own reputation and circumstances , all urged me forward ; all pressed me to undertake that which I say to be impracticable . They whose spirits are formed like mine , to whom a public exhibition of themselves , on any occasion , is mortal poison , may have some idea of the horrors of my situation ; others can have none .</p>
   <p>My continual misery at length brought on a nervous fever : quiet forsook me by day , and peace by night ; a finger raised against me was more than I could stand against . In this posture of mind , I attended regularly at the office ; where , instead of a soul upon the rack , the the most active spirits were essentially necessary for my purpose . I expected no assistance from anybody there , all the inferior clerks being under the influence of my opponent ; and accordingly I received none . The journal books were indeed thrown open to me , a thing which could not be refused ; and from which , perhaps , a man in health , and with a head turned to business , might have gained all the information he wanted ; but it was not so with me . I read without perception , and was so distressed , that , had every clerk in the office been my friend , it could have availed me little ; for I was not in a condition to receive instruction , much less to elicit it out of manuscripts , without direction . Many months went over me thus employed ; constant in the use of means , despairing as to the issue .</p>
   <p>The feelings of a man when he arrives at the place of execution , are probably much like mine every time I set my foot in the office , which was every day for more than half a year together .</p>
   <p>At length , the vacation being pretty far advanced , I made a shift to get into the country , and repaired to Margate . There , by the help of cheerful company , a new scene , and the intermission of my painful employment , I presently began to recover my spirits ; though even here , for some time after my arrival ( no-withstanding , perhaps , that the preceding day had been spent agreeably , and without any disturbing recollection of my circumstances ) , my first reflections , when I awoke in the morning , were horrible and full of wretchedness . I looked forward to the approaching winter , and regretted the flight of every moment which brought it nearer ; like a man borne away by a rapid torrent into a stormy sea , whence he sees no possibility of returning , and where he knows he cannot subsist . At length , indeed , I acquired such a facility of turning away my thoughts from the ensuing crisis , that , for weeks together , I hardly adverted to it at all ; but the stress of the tempest was yet to come , and was not to be avoided by any resolution of mine to look another way .</p>
   <p>“ How wonderful are the works of the Lord , and his ways past finding out ! ” Thus was he preparing me for an event which I least of all expected , even the reception of his blessed gospel , working by means which , in all human contemplation , must needs seem directly opposite to that purpose , but which , in his wise and gracious disposal , have , I trust , effectually accomplished it .</p>
   <p>About the beginning of October , 1763 , I was again required to attend the office and prepare for the push . This no sooner took place , than all my misery returned ; again I visited the scene of ineffectual labours ; again I felt myself pressed by necessity on either side , with nothing but despair in prospect . To this dilemma was I reduced , either to keep possession of the office to the last extremity , and by so doing expose myself to a public rejection for insufficiency ( for the little knowledge I had acquired would have quite forsaken me at the bar of the house ) ; or else to fling it up at once , and by this means run the hazard of ruining my benefactor 's right of appointment , by bringing his discretion into question . In this situation , such a fit of passion has sometimes seized me , when alone in my chambers , that I have cried out aloud , and cursed the hour of my birth ; lifting up my eyes to heaven , at the same time , not as a supplicant , but in the spirit of reproach against my Maker . A thought would sometime come across my mind , that my sins had perhaps brought this distress upon me , that the hand of divine vengeance was in it ; but in the pride of my heart , I presently acquitted myself , and thereby implicitly charged God with injustice , saying , “ What sins have I committed to deserve this ? ”</p>
   <p>I saw plainly that God alone could deliver me ; but was firmly persuaded that he would not , and therefore omitted to ask it . Indeed at his hands , I would not ; but as Saul sought to the witch , so did I to the physician , Dr. Heberden ; and was as diligent in the use of drugs , as if they would have healed my wounded spirit , or have made the rough places plain before me . I made , indeed , one effort of a devotional kind ; for , having found a prayer or two , I said them a few nights , but with so little expectation of prevailing that way , that I soon laid aside the book , and with it all thoughts of God and hopes of a remedy .</p>
   <p>I now began to look upon madness as the only chance remaining . I had a strong kind of foreboding that so it would one day fare with me ; and I wished for it earnestly , and looked forward to it with impatient expectation . My chief fear was , that my senses would not fail me time enough to excuse my appearance at the bar of the House of Lords , which was the only purpose I wanted it to answer . Accordingly , the day of decision drew near , and I was still in my senses ; though in my heart I had formed many wishes , and by word of mouth expressed many expectations to the contrary .</p>
   <p>Now came the grand temptation ; the point to which Satan had all the while been driving me . I grew more sullen and reserved , fled from society , even from my most intimate friends , and shut myself up in my chambers . The ruin of my fortune , the contempt of my relations and acquaintance , the prejudice I should do to my patron , were all urged on me with irresistible energy . Being reconciled to the apprehension of madness , I began to be reconciled to the apprehension of death . Though formerly , in my happiest hours , I had never been able to glance a single thought that way , without shuddering at the idea of dissolution , I now wished for it , and found myself but little shocked at the idea of procuring it myself . I considered life as my property , and therefore at my own disposal . Men of great name , I observed , had destroyed themselves ; and the world still retained the profoundest respect for their memories .</p>
   <p>[ An imperative sense of duty compels me to throw a veil over the afflicting details which follow . Respect for the known wishes of my departed brother-in-law , a desire not to wound the feelings of living characters , and a consciousness that such disclosures are not suited to meet the public eye , confirm me in this resolution . It may be said , the facts are accessible , and may be known ; why make a mystery of communicating them ? My answer is , I am a father ; I will not inflict a shock on the youthful minds of my own children , neither will I be instrumental in conveying it to those of others . I will make such use of the Memoir as may answer the purpose I have in view , but I will not be the medium of revealing the secrets of the prison-house . It is sufficient to state that Cowper meditated the crime of self-destruction , and that he was arrested in his purpose by an Almighty arm . To quote his own emphatic words , “ Unless my Eternal Father in Christ Jesus had interposed to disannul my covenant with death , and my agreement with hell , that I might hereafter be admitted into the covenant of mercy , I had by this time been the just object of his boundless vengeance . ”</p>
   <p>All expectation of being able to hold the office in parliament being now at an end , he despatched a friend to his relative at the coffee-house . ]</p>
   <p>As soon , he observes , as the latter arrived , I apprised him of the attempt I had been making . His words were , “ My dear Mr. Cowper , you terrify me ; to be sure you cannot hold the office at this rate . Where is the deputation ? ” I gave him the key of the drawers where it was deposited ; and , his business requiring his immediate attendance , he took it away with him ; and thus ended all my connexion with the parliament house .</p>
   <p>To this moment I had felt no concern of a spiritual kind . Ignorant of original sin , insensible of the guilt of actual transgression , I understood neither the law nor the gospel ; the condemning nature of the one , nor the restoring mercies of the other . I was as much unacquainted with Christ , in all his saving offices , as if his blessed name had never reached me . Now , therefore , a new scene opened upon me . Conviction of sin took place , especially of that just committed ; the meanness of it , as well as its atrocity , were exhibited to me in colours so inconceivably strong , that I despised myself , with a contempt not to be imagined or expressed , for having attempted it . This sense of it secured me from the repetition of a crime , which I could not now reflect on without abhorrence .</p>
   <p>A sense of God 's wrath , and a deep despair of escaping it , instantly succeeded . The fear of death became much more prevalent in me than ever the desire of it had been .</p>
   <p>A frequent flashing , like that of fire , before my eyes , and an excessive pressure upon the brain , made me apprehensive of an apoplexy .</p>
   <p>By the advice of my dear friend and benefactor , who called upon me again at noon , I sent for a physician , and told him the fact , and the stroke I apprehended . He assured me there was no danger of it , and advised me by all means to retire into the country . Being made easy in that particular , and not knowing where to better myself , I continued in my chambers , where the solitude of my situation left me at full liberty to attend to my spiritual state ; a matter I had till this day never sufficiently thought of .</p>
   <p>At this time I wrote to my brother , at Cambridge , to inform him of the distress I had been in , and the dreadful method I had taken to deliver myself from it ; assuring him , as I faithfully might , that I had laid aside all such horrid intentions , and was desirous to live as long as it would please the Almighty to permit me .</p>
   <p>My sins were now set in array against me , and I began to see and feel that I had lived without God in the world . As I walked to and fro in my chamber , I said within myself , “ There never was so abandoned a wretch , so great a sinner . ” All my worldly sorrows seemed as though they had never been ; the terrors which succeeded them seemed so great and so much more afflicting . One moment I thought myself shut out from mercy by one chapter ; the next by another . The sword of the Spirit seemed to guard the tree of life from my touch , and to flame against me in every avenue by which I attempted to approach it . I particularly remember , that the parable of the barren fig-tree was to me an inconceivable source of anguish ; and I applied it to myself , with a strong persuasion in my mind that , when the Saviour pronounced a curse upon it , he had me in his eye , and pointed that curse directly at me .</p>
   <p>I turned over all Archbishop Tillotson 's sermons , in hopes to find one upon the subject , and consulted my brother upon the true meaning of it ; desirous , if possible , to obtain a different interpretation of the matter than my evil conscience would suffer me to fasten on it . “ O Lord , thou didst vex me with all thy storms , all thy billows went over me ; thou didst run upon me like a giant in the night season , thou didst scare me with visions in the night season . ”</p>
   <p>In every book I opened , I found something that struck me to the heart . I remember taking up a volume of Beaumont and Fletcher , which lay upon the table in my kinsman 's lodgings , and the first sentence which I saw was this : “ The justice of the gods is in it . ” My heart instantly replied , “ It is a truth ; ” and I cannot but observe , that as I found something in every author to condemn me , so it was the first sentence , in general , I pitched upon . Everything preached to me , and everything preached the curse of the law .</p>
   <p>I was now strongly tempted to use laudanum , not as a poison , but as an opiate , to compose my spirits ; to stupify my awakened and feeling mind , harassed with sleepless nights and days of uninterrupted misery . But God forbad it , who would have nothing to interfere with the quickening work he had begun in me ; and neither the want of rest , nor continued agony of mind , could bring me to the use of it : I hated and abhorred the very smell of it .</p>
   <p>Having an obscure notion about the efficacy of faith , I resolved upon an experiment to prove whether I had faith or not . For this purpose , I resolved to repeat the Creed : when I came to the second period of it , all traces of the former were struck out of my memory , nor could I recollect one syllable of the matter . While I endeavoured to recover it , and when just upon the point , I perceived a sensation in my brain , like a tremulous vibration in all the fibres of it . By this means I lost the words in the very instant when I thought to have laid hold of them . This threw me into an agony ; but , growing a little calmer , I made an attempt for the third time ; here again I failed in the same manner as before .</p>
   <p>In this condition my brother found me , and the first words I spoke to him were , “ Oh ! brother , I am lost ! think of eternity , and then think what it is to be lost ! ” I had , indeed , a sense of eternity impressed upon my mind , which seemed almost to amount to a full comprehension of it .</p>
   <p>My brother , pierced to the heart with the sight of my misery , tried to comfort me , but all to no purpose . I refused comfort , and my mind appeared to me in such colours , that to administer it to me was only to exasperate me , and to mock my fears .</p>
   <p>At length , I remembered my friend Martin Madan , and sent for him . I used to think him an enthusiast , but now seemed convinced that , if there was any balm in Gilead , he must administer it to me . On former occasions , when my spiritual concerns had at any time occurred to me , I thought likewise on the necessity of repentance . I knew that many persons had spoken of shedding tears for sin ; but , when I asked myself , whether the time would ever come when I should weep for mine , it seemed to me that a stone might sooner do it .</p>
   <p>Not knowing that Christ was exalted to give repentance , I despaired of ever attaining to it . My friend came to me ; we sat on the bed-side together , and he began to declare to me the gospel . He spoke of original sin , and the corruption of every man born into the world , whereby every one is a child of wrath . I perceived something like hope dawning in my heart . This doctrine set me more on a level with the rest of mankind , and made my condition appear less desperate .</p>
   <p>Next he insisted on the all-atoning efficacy of the blood of Jesus , and his righteousness , for our justification . While I heard this part of his discourse , and the scriptures on which he founded it , my heart began to burn within me , my soul was pierced with a sense of my bitter ingratitude to so merciful a Saviour ; and those tears , which I thought impossible , burst forth freely . I saw clearly that my case required such a remedy , and had not the least doubt within me but that this was the gospel of salvation .</p>
   <p>Lastly , he urged the necessity of a lively faith in Jesus Christ ; not an assent only of the understanding , but a faith of application , an actually laying hold of it , and embracing it as a salvation wrought out for me personally . Here I failed , and deplored my want of such a faith . He told me it was the gift of God , which he trusted he would bestow upon me . I could only reply , “ I wish he would : ” a very irreverent petition ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 753 ]</span>but a very sincere one , and such as the blessed God , in his due time , was pleased to answer .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 753 ]</span>It could hardly be called irreverent , unless the manner in which it was uttered rendered it such .</p>
   <p>My brother , finding that I had received consolation from Mr. Madan , was very anxious that I should take the earliest opportunity of conversing with him again ; and , for this purpose , pressed me to go to him immediately . I was for putting it off , but my brother seemed impatient of delay ; and , at length , prevailed on me to set out . I mention this , to the honour of his candour and humanity ; which would suffer no difference of sentiments to interfere with them . My welfare was his only object , and all prejudices fled before his zeal to procure it . May he receive , for his recompence , all that happiness the gospel , which I then first became acquainted with , is alone able to impart !</p>
   <p>Easier , indeed , I was , but far from easy . The wounded spirit within me was less in pain , but by no means healed . What I had experienced was but the beginning of sorrows , and a long train of still greater terrors was at hand . I slept my three hours well , and then awoke with ten times a stronger alienation from God than ever .</p>
   <p>At eleven o'clock my brother called upon me , and , in about an hour after his arrival , that distemper of mind , which I had so ardently wished for , actually seized me .</p>
   <p>While I traversed the apartment , expecting every moment the earth would open her mouth and swallow me , my conscience scaring me , and the city of refuge out of reach and out of sight , a strange and horrible darkness fell upon me . If it were possible that a heavy blow could light on the brain , without touching the skull , such was the sensation I felt . I clapped my hand to my forehead , and cried aloud , through the pain it gave me . At every stroke my thoughts and expressions became more wild and incoherent ; all that remained clear was the sense of sin , and the expectation of punishment . These kept undisturbed possession all through my illness , without interruption or abatement .</p>
   <p>My brother instantly observed the change , and consulted with my friends on the best manner to dispose of me . It was agreed among them , that I should be carried to St. Alban 's , where Dr. Cotton kept a house for the reception of such patients , and with whom I was known to have a slight acquaintance . Not only his skill as a physician recommended him to their choice , but his well-known humanity and sweetness of temper . It will be proper to draw a veil over the secrets of my prison-house : let it suffice to say , that the low state of body and mind to which I was reduced was perfectly well calculated to humble the natural vain-glory and pride of my heart .</p>
   <p>These are the efficacious means which Infinite Wisdom thought meet to make use of for that purpose . A sense of self-loathing and abhorrence ran through all my insanity . Conviction of sin , and expectation of instant judgment , never left me , from the 7th of December 1763 , until the middle of July following . The accuser of the brethren was ever busy with me night and day , bringing to my recollection in dreams the commission of long-forgotten sins , and charging upon my conscience things of an indifferent nature as atrocious crimes .</p>
   <p>All that passed in this long interval of eight months may be classed under two heads , conviction of sin , and despair of mercy . But , blessed be the God of my salvation , for every sigh I drew , for every tear I shed ; since thus it pleased him to judge me here , that I might not be judged hereafter .</p>
   <p>After five months of continual expectation that the divine vengeance would overtake me , I became so familiar with despair as to have contracted a sort of hardiness and indifference as to the event . I began to persuade myself that , while the execution of the sentence was suspended , it would be for my interest to indulge a less horrible train of ideas than I had been accustomed to muse upon . By the means I entered into conversation with the doctor , laughed at his stories , and told him some of my own to match them ; still , however , carrying a sentence of irrevocable doom in my heart .</p>
   <p>He observed the seeming alteration with pleasure . Believing , as well he might , that my smiles were sincere , he thought my recovery well-nigh completed ; but they were , in reality , like the green surface of a morass , pleasant to the eye , but a cover for nothing but rottenness and filth . The only thing that could promote and effectuate my cure was yet wanting ; an experimental knowledge of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus .</p>
   <p>In about three months more ( July 25 , 1764 ) my brother came from Cambridge to visit me . Dr. C. having told him that he thought me greatly amended , he was rather disappointed at finding me almost as silent and reserved as ever ; for the first sight of him struck me with many painful sensations both of sorrow for my own remediless condition and envy of his happiness .</p>
   <p>As soon as we were left alone , he asked me how I found myself ; I answered , “ As much better as despair can make me . ” We went together into the garden . Here , on expressing a settled assurance of sudden judgment , he protested to me that it was all a delusion ; and protested so strongly , that I could not help giving some attention to him . I burst into tears , and cried out , “ If it be a delusion , then am I the happiest of beings . ” Something like a ray of hope was shot into my heart ; but still I was afraid to indulge it . We dined together , and I spent the afternoon in a more cheerful manner . Something seemed to whisper to me every moment , “ Still there is mercy . ”</p>
   <p>Even after he left me , this change of sentiment gathered ground continually ; yet my mind was in such a fluctuating state , that I can only call it a vague presage of better things at hand , without being able to assign a reason for it . The servant observed a sudden alteration in me for the better : and the man , whom I have ever since retained in my service ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 754 ]</span>expressed great joy on the occasion .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 754 ]</span>Samuel Roberts .</p>
   <p>I went to bed and slept well . In the morning , I dreamed that the sweetest boy I ever saw came dancing up to my bedside ; he seemed just out of leading-strings , yet I took particular notice of the firmness and steadiness of his tread . The sight affected me with pleasure , and served at least to harmonize my spirits ; so that I awoke for the first time with a sensation of delight on my mind . Still , however , I knew not where to look for the establishment of the comfort I felt ; my joy was as much a mystery to myself as to those about me . The blessed God was preparing for me the clearer light of his countenance , by this first dawning of that light upon me .</p>
   <p>Within a few days of my first arrival at St. Alban 's , I had thrown aside the word of God , as a book in which I had no longer any interest or portion . The only instance , in which I can recollect reading a single chapter , was about two months before my recovery . Having found a Bible on the bench in the garden , I opened upon the 11th of St. John , where Lazarus is raised from the dead ; and saw so much benevolence , mercy , goodness , and sympathy , with miserable man , in our Saviour 's conduct , that I almost shed tears even after the relation ; little thinking that it was an exact type of the mercy which Jesus was on the point of extending towards myself . I sighed , and said , “ Oh , that I had not rejected so good a Redeemer , that I had not forfeited all his favours ! ” Thus was my heart softened , though not yet enlightened . I closed the book , without intending to open it again .</p>
   <p>Having risen with somewhat of a more cheerful feeling , I repaired to my room , where breakfast waited for me . While I sat at table , I found the cloud of horror , which had so long hung over me , was every moment passing away ; and every moment came fraught with hope . I was continually more and more persuaded that I was not utterly doomed to destruction . The way of salvation was still , however , hid from my eyes ; nor did I see it at all clearer than before my illness . I only thought that , if it would please God to spare me , I would lead a better life ; and that I would yet escape hell , if a religious observance of my duty would secure me from it .</p>
   <p>Thus may the terror of the Lord make a pharisee ; but only the sweet voice of mercy in the gospel can make a Christian .</p>
   <note>We are now arrived at the eventful crisis of Cowper 's conversion and restoration , which is thus recorded in his own words .</note>
   <p>But the happy period which was to shake off my fetters , and afford me a clear opening of the free mercy of God in Christ Jesus , was now arrived . I flung myself into a chair near the window , and , seeing a Bible there , ventured once more to apply to it for comfort and instruction . The first verse I saw was the 25th of the 3rd of Romans ; “ Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God . ”</p>
   <p>Immediately I received strength to believe it , and the full beams of the Sun of Righteousness shone upon me . I saw the sufficiency of the atonement he had made , my pardon sealed in his blood , and all the fulness and completeness of his justification . In a moment I believed , and received the gospel . Whatever my friend Madan had said to me , long before , revived in all its clearness , with demonstration of the Spirit and with power . Unless the Almighty arm had been under me , I think I should have died with gratitude and joy . My eyes filled with tears , and my voice choked with transport , I could only look up to heaven in silent fear , overwhelmed with love and wonder . But the work of the Holy Ghost is best described in his own words , it is “ joy unspeakable , and full of glory . ” Thus was my heavenly Father in Christ Jesus pleased to give me the full assurance of faith , and out of a strong , stony , unbelieving heart , to raise up a child unto Abraham . How glad should I now have been to have spent every moment in prayer and thanksgiving !</p>
   <p>I lost no opportunity of repairing to a throne of grace ; but flew to it with an earnestness irresistible and never to be satisfied . Could I help it ? Could I do otherwise than love and rejoice in my reconciled Father in Christ Jesus ? The Lord had enlarged my heart , and I ran in the way of his commandments . For many succeeding weeks , tears were ready to flow , if I did but speak of the gospel , or mention the name of Jesus . To rejoice day and night was all my employment . Too happy to sleep much , I thought it was but lost time that was spent in slumber . O that the ardour of my first love had continued ! But I have known many a lifeless and unhallowed hour since ; long intervals of darkness , interrupted by short returns of peace and joy in believing .</p>
   <p>My physician , ever watchful and apprehensive for my welfare , was now alarmed , lest the sudden transition from despair to joy should terminate in a fatal frenzy . But “ the Lord was my strength and my song , and was become my salvation . ” I said , “ I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the Lord ; he has chastened me sore , but not given me over unto death . O give thanks unto the Lord , for his mercy endureth for ever . ”</p>
   <p>In a short time , Dr. C. became satisfied , and acquiesced in the soundness of my cure : and much sweet communion I had with him , concerning the things of our salvation . He visited me every morning while I stayed with him , which was near twelve months after my recovery , and the gospel was the delightful theme of our conversation .</p>
   <p>No trial has befallen me since , but what might be expected in a state of warfare . Satan , indeed , has changed his battery . Before my conversion , sensual gratification was the weapon with which he sought to destroy me . Being naturally of an easy , quiet disposition , I was seldom tempted to anger ; yet that passion it is which now gives me the most disturbance , and occasions the sharpest conflicts . But , Jesus being my strength , I fight against it ; and if I am not conqueror , yet I am not overcome .</p>
   <p>I now employed my brother to seek out an abode for me in the neighbourhood of Cambridge , being determined , by the Lord 's leave , to see London , the scene of my former abominations , no more . I had still one place of preferment left , which seemed to bind me under the necessity of returning thither again . But I resolved to break the bond , chiefly because my peace of conscience was in question . I held , for some years , the office of commissioner of bankrupts , with about 60l . per annum . Conscious of my ignorance of the law , I could not take the accustomed oath , and resigned it ; thereby releasing myself from an occasion of great sin , and every obligation to return to London . By this means , I reduced myself to an income scarcely sufficient for my maintenance ; but I would rather have starved in reality than deliberately offend against my Saviour ; and his great mercy has since raised me up such friends , as have enabled me to enjoy all the comforts and conveniences of life . I am well assured that , while I live , “ bread shall be given me , and water shall be sure , ” according to his gracious promise .</p>
   <p>After my brother had made many unsuccessful attempts to procure me a dwelling near him , I one day poured out my soul in prayer to God , beseeching him that , wherever he should be pleased , in his fatherly mercy , to lead me , it might be in the society of those who feared his name , and loved the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity ; a prayer of which I have good reason to acknowledge his gracious acceptance .</p>
   <p>In the beginning of June , 1765 , I received a letter from my brother , to say , he had taken lodgings for me at Huntingdon , which he believed would suit me . Though it was sixteen miles from Cambridge , I was resolved to take them ; for I had been two months in perfect health , and my circumstances required a less expensive way of life . It was with great reluctance , however , that I thought of leaving the place of my second nativity ; I had so much leisure there to study the blessed word of God , and had enjoyed so much happiness ; but God ordered everything for me like an indulgent Father , and had prepared a more comfortable place of residence than I could have chosen for myself .</p>
   <p>On the 7th of June , 1765 , having spent more than eighteen months at St. Alban 's , partly in bondage , and partly in the liberty wherewith Christ had made me free , I took my leave of the place at four in the morning , and set out for Cambridge .</p>
   <p>The servant , whom I lately mentioned as rejoicing in my recovery , attended me . He had maintained such an affectionate watchfulness over me during my whole illness , and waited on me with so much patience and gentleness , that I could not bear to leave him behind , though it was with some difficulty the Doctor was prevailed on to part with him . The strongest argument of all was the earnest desire he expressed to follow me . He seemed to have been providentially thrown in my way , having entered Dr. C .' s service just time enough to attend me ; and I have strong ground to hope , that God will use me as an instrument to bring him to a knowledge of Jesus . It is impossible to say with how delightful a sense of his protection and fatherly care of me , it has pleased the Almighty to favour me , during the whole journey .</p>
   <p>I remembered the pollution which is in the world , and the sad share I had in it myself ; and my heart ached at the thought of entering it again . The blessed God had endued me with some concern for his glory , and I was fearful of hearing it traduced by oaths and blasphemies , the common language of this highly favoured , but ungrateful country .<span type="note_anchor">[ 755 ]</span>But “ fear not , I am with thee , ” was my comfort . I passed the whole journey in silent communion with God ; and those hours are amongst the happiest I have known .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 755 ]</span>There is a considerable improvement in public manners since this period , and oaths and blasphemies would not be tolerated in well-bred society . May the hallowed influence of the Gospel be instrumental in producing a still happier change !</p>
   <p>I repaired to Huntingdon the Saturday after my arrival at Cambridge . My brother , who had attended me thither , had no sooner left me than , finding myself surrounded by strangers and in a strange place , my spirits began to sink , and I felt ( such were the backslidings of my heart ) like a traveller in the midst of an inhospitable desert , without a friend to comfort or a guide to direct me . I walked forth , towards the close of the day , in this melancholy frame of mind , and , having wandered about a mile from the town , I found my heart , at length , so powerfully drawn towards the Lord , that , having gained a retired and secret nook in the corner of a field , I kneeled down under a bank , and poured forth my complaints before him . It pleased my Saviour to hear me , in that this oppression was taken off , and I was enabled to trust in him that careth for the stranger , to roll my burden upon him , and to rest assured that , wheresoever he might cast my lot , the God of all consolation would still be with me . But this was not all . He did for me more than either I had asked or thought .</p>
   <p>The next day , I went to church for the first time after my recovery . Throughout the whole service , I had much to do to restrain my emotions , so fully did I see the beauty and the glory of the Lord . My heart was full of love to all the congregation , especially to them in whom I observed an air of sober attention . A grave and sober person sat in the pew with me ; him I have since seen and often conversed with , and have found him a pious man , and a true servant of the blessed Redeemer . While he was singing the psalm , I looked at him , and , observing him intent on his holy employment , I could not help saying in my heart , with much emotion , “ Bless you , for praising Him whom my soul loveth ! ”</p>
   <p>Such was the goodness of the Lord to me , that he gave me “ the oil of joy for mourning , and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness ; ” and though my voice was silent , being stopped by the intenseness of what I felt , yet my soul sung within me , and even leaped for joy . And when the gospel for the day was read , the sound of it was more than I could well support . Oh , what a word is the word of God , when the Spirit quickens us to receive it , and gives the hearing ear , and the understanding heart ! The harmony of heaven is in it , and discovers its author . The parable of the prodigal son was the portion . I saw myself in that glass so clearly , and the loving-kindness of my slighted and forgotten Lord , that the whole scene was realized to me , and acted over in my heart .</p>
   <p>I went immediately after church to the place where I had prayed the day before , and found the relief I had there received was but the earnest of a richer blessing . How shall I express what the Lord did for me , except by saying , that he made all his goodness to pass before me ! I seemed to speak to him face to face , as a man conversing with his friend , except that my speech was only in tears of joy , and groanings which cannot be uttered . I could say , indeed , with Jacob , not “ how dreadful , ” but how lovely , “ is this place ! This is none other than the house of God . ”</p>
   <p>Four months I continued in my lodging . Some few of the neighbours came to see me , but their visits were not very frequent ; and , in general , I had but little intercourse , except with my God in Christ Jesus . It was he who made my solitude sweet , and the wilderness to bloom and blossom as the rose ; and my meditation of him was so delightful that , if I had few other comforts , neither did I want any .</p>
   <p>One day , however , towards the expiration of this period , I found myself in a state of desertion . That communion which I had so long been able to maintain with the Lord was suddenly interrupted . I began to dislike my solitary situation , and to fear I should never be able to weather out the winter in so lonely a dwelling . Suddenly a thought struck me , which I shall not fear to call a suggestion of the good providence which had brought me to Huntingdon . A few months before , I had formed an acquaintance with the Rev . Mr. Unwin 's family . His son , though he had heard that I rather declined society than sought it , and though Mrs. Unwin herself dissuaded him from visiting me on that account , was yet so strongly inclined to it , that , notwithstanding all objections and arguments to the contrary , he one day engaged himself , as we were coming out of church , after morning prayers , to drink tea with me that afternoon . To my inexpressible joy , I found him one whose notions of religion were spiritual and lively ; one whom the Lord had been training up from his infancy for the service of the temple . We opened our hearts to each other at the first interview , and , when we parted , I immediately retired to my chamber , and prayed the Lord , who had been the author , to be the guardian of our friendship , and to grant to it fervency and perpetuity , even unto death : and I doubt not that my gracious Father heard this prayer also .</p>
   <p>The Sunday following I dined with him . That afternoon , while the rest of the family was withdrawn , I had much discourse with Mrs. Unwin . I am not at liberty to describe the pleasure I had in conversing with her , because she will be one of the first who will have the perusal of this narrative . Let it suffice to say , I found we had one faith , and had been baptized with the same baptism .</p>
   <p>When I returned home , I gave thanks to God , who had so graciously answered my prayers , by bringing me into the society of Christians . She has since been a means in the hand of God of supporting , quickening , and strengthening me , in my walk with him . It was long before I thought of any other connexion with this family , than as a friend and neighbour . On the day , however , above mentioned , while I was revolving in my mind the nature of my situation , and beginning , for the first time , to find an irksomeness in such retirement , suddenly it occurred to me , that I might probably find a place in Mr. Unwin 's family as a boarder . A young gentleman , who had lived with him as a pupil , was the day before gone to Cambridge . It appeared to me , at least , possible , that I might be allowed to succeed him . From the moment this thought struck me , such a tumult of anxious solicitude seized me , that for two or three days I could not divert my mind to any other subject . I blamed and condemned myself for want of submission to the Lord 's will ; but still the language of my mutinous and disobedient heart was , “ Give me the blessing , or else I die . ”</p>
   <p>About the third evening after I had determined upon this measure , I , at length , made shift to fasten my thoughts upon a theme which had no manner of connexion with it . While I was pursuing my meditations , Mr. Unwin and family quite out of sight , my attention was suddenly called home again by the words which had been continually playing in my mind , and were , at length , repeated with such importunity that I could not help regarding them :— “ The Lord God of truth will do this . ” I was effectually convinced , that they were not of my own production , and accordingly I received from them some assurance of success ; but my unbelief and fearfulness robbed me of much of the comfort they were intended to convey ; though I have since had many a blessed experience of the same kind , for which I can never be sufficiently thankful . I immediately began to negotiate the affair , and in a few days it was entirely concluded .</p>
   <p>I took possession of my new abode , Nov. 11 , 1765 . I have found it a place of rest prepared for me by God 's own hand , where he has blessed me with a thousand mercies , and instances of his fatherly protection ; and where he has given me abundant means of furtherance in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus , both by the study of his own word , and communion with his dear disciples . May nothing but death interrupt our union !</p>

   <p>Painful as this memoir is in some of its earlier details , yet we know nothing more simple and beautiful in narrative , more touching and ingenuous in sentiment , than its happy sequel and consummation . It resembles the storm that desolates the plain , but which is afterwards succeeded by the glowing beauties of the renovated landscape . No document ever furnished an ampler refutation of the remark that ascribes his malady to the operation of religious causes . On the contrary , it appears that his first relief , under the tyranny of an unfeeling school-boy , was in the exercise of prayer , and that some of his happiest moments , in the enjoyment of the Divine presence , were experienced in the frame of mind which he describes , when at Southampton — that in proportion as he forgot the heavenly Monitor , his peace vanished , his passions resumed the ascendency , and he presented an unhappy compound of guilt and wretchedness . The history of his malady is developed in his own memoir with all the clearness of the most circumstantial evidence . A morbid temperament laid the foundation ; an extreme susceptibility exposed him to continual nervous irritation ; and early disappointments deepened the impression . At length , with a mind unoccupied by study , and undisciplined by self-command — contemplating a “ public exhibition of himself as mortal poison , ” he sank under an offer which a more buoyant spirit would have grasped as an object of honourable ambition . In this state religion found him , and administered the happy cure .</p>
   <p>That a morbid temperament was the originating cause of his depression is confirmed by an affecting passage in one of his poems .</p>
   <p>In the beautiful and much admired lines on his mother 's picture , there is the following pathetic remark :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">My mother ! when I learn 'd that thou wast dead ,</l>
     <l n="2">Say , wast thou conscious of the tears I shed ?</l>
     <l n="3">Hover 'd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son ,</l>
     <l n="4">Wretch even then , life 's journey just begun ?</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In dwelling on these predisposing causes , the Editor thinks it right to state , in the most unequivocal manner , that there is not the remotest reason for supposing that any hereditary malady existed in the family of Cowper sufficient to account for this afflicting dispensation . There was an inflammatory action of his blood , and peculiar irritability of the nervous system , which a wise and salutary self-control and the early influence of religious principles might have subdued , or at least modified . Employment , also , or the active exercise of the faculties , seems indispensable to health and happiness .<span type="note_anchor">[ 756 ]</span>He who lives without an allotted occupation is seldom either wise , virtuous , or happy . The mind recoils upon itself , and is consumed by its own fires . Providence , after the Fall , in mercy , not less than in justice , decreed that man should live by the sweat of his brow ; that , in the same moment that he was reminded of his punishment , he might find the toil itself a powerful alleviation to his sufferings , and the exercise of all his faculties the road to competency , to usefulness , and honour .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 756 ]</span>Cowper adopted a profession , but never pursued it with perseverance .</p>
   <p>Two events contributed to exercise a most injurious influence on the morbid mind of Cowper , not recorded in his own Memoir . We allude to the death of his friend Sir William Russel , and his hopeless attachment to Miss Theodora Cowper .</p>
   <p>Sir William was the contemporary of Cowper at Westminster , and his most intimate friend . This intercourse was continued in their riper years , on the footing of the most endearing friendship . Unhappily , young Russel was cut off by a premature death ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 757 ]</span>while bathing in the Thames , amidst all the opening prospects of life , and with accomplishments and virtues that adorned his rank and station . This occurrence inflicted a great moral shock on the sensitive mind of Cowper .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 757 ]</span>Shortness of life seems to have been peculiar to this family . The writer well remembers the two last baronets , viz . Sir John Russel , whose form was so weak and fragile , that , when resident at the University of Oxford , he was supported by instruments of steel . He died at the early age of twenty-one . 2ndly . Sir George Russel , his brother , who survived only till his twenty-second year . The editor followed him to his grave . The family residence was at Chequers , in Buckinghamshire , an ancient seat , and restored at great expense by these last direct descendants of their race . Chequers was formerly noted as the place where Hampden , Cromwell , and a few others , held their secret meetings , and concerted their measures of opposition against the government of Charles I . The estate afterwards devolved to Robert Greenhill , Esq .</p>
   <p>But it was his attachment to Miss Theodora Jane Cowper that formed the eventful era in his early life , and clouded all his future prospects . The relation of this fact is wholly omitted by Hayley , in compliance , we presume , with the express wishes of the family . It was , indeed , understood to be a prohibited subject , and involved in much mystery . The name of this lady was never uttered by Cowper , nor mentioned in his presence ; and , after his death , delicacy towards the survivor equally imposed the duty of silence . The brother-in-law of the Editor , the Rev . Dr. Johnson , conscious that a correspondence must have existed between the poet and the fair object of his attachment , requested to know whether he could be furnished with any documents , and permitted without a violation of delicacy to lay them before the public . The writer was also commissioned by him to solicit an interview , and to urge the same request , but without success . An intimation was at length conveyed that no documents could see the light till after the decease of the owner . The death of this lady , in the year 1824 , at a very advanced age , removed the veil of secrecy , though the leading facts were known by a small circle of friends , through the confidential communications of Lady Hesketh and Dr. Johnson . We now proceed to the details of this transaction . Miss Theodora Cowper was the second daughter of Ashley Cowper , Esq ., the poet 's uncle , and sister to Lady Hesketh ; she was , consequently , own cousin to Cowper . She is described as having been a young lady possessed of great personal attractions , highly accomplished , and distinguished by the qualities that engage affection and regard . It is no wonder that a person of Cowper 's susceptibility yielded to so powerful an influence . She soon became the theme of his poetical effusions , which have since been communicated to the public .<span type="note_anchor">[ 758 ]</span>They are juvenile compositions , but interesting , as forming the earliest productions of his muse , and recording his attachment to his cousin . Miss Theodora Cowper was by no means insensible to the regards of her admirer , and the father was eventually solicited to ratify her choice . But Mr. Ashley Cowper , attached as he was to his nephew , and anxious to promote the happiness of his daughter , could by no means be induced to listen to the proposition . His objections were founded , first , on the near degree of relationship in which they stood to each other ; and secondly , on the inadequacy of Cowper 's fortune . From this resolution no entreaty could induce him to depart . The poet therefore was compelled to cherish a hopeless passion , which no lapse of time was capable of effacing ; and his fair cousin , on her part , discovered a corresponding fidelity .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 758 ]</span>Poems , the Early Productions of William Cowper .</p>
   <p>The subsequent melancholy event , recorded in the Memoir , at once extinguished all further hopes on the subject .</p>
   <p>How powerfully his feelings were affected by the death of his friend , Sir William , and by his disappointment in love , may be seen by the following pathetic lines , referring to Miss Theodora Cowper :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Doom 'd as I am , in solitude to waste</l>
     <l n="2">The present moments , and regret the past ;</l>
     <l n="3">Depriv 'd of every joy I valued most ,</l>
     <l n="4">My friend torn from me and my mistress lost ;</l>
     <l n="5">Call not this gloom I wear , this anxious mien ,</l>
     <l n="6">The dull effect of humour , or of spleen !</l>
     <l n="7">Still , still , I mourn with each returning day ,</l>
     <l n="8">Him , snatch 'd by fate in early youth away ;</l>
     <l n="9">And her — through tedious years of doubt and pain</l>
     <l n="10">Fix 'd in her choice and faithful — but in vain !</l>
     <l n="11">O prone to pity , generous , and sincere ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whose eye ne'er yet refused the wretch a tear ;</l>
     <l n="13">Whose heart the real claim of friendship knows ,</l>
     <l n="14">Nor thinks a lover 's are but fancied woes ;</l>
     <l n="15">See me — ere yet my destin 'd course half done ,</l>
     <l n="16">Cast forth a wand'rer on a world unknown !</l>
     <l n="17">See me neglected on the world 's rude coast ,</l>
     <l n="18">Each dear companion of my voyage lost !</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Such were the preparatory causes that weakened and depressed the mind of Cowper . The immediate and exciting cause of his unhappy derangement has already been faithfully disclosed , as well as the occasion that ministered to its cure .</p>
   <p>Pursuing this interesting and yet painful subject in the order of events , it appears that , after spending nearly ten years in the enjoyment of much inward peace , he was visited in the year 1773 , at Olney , with a return , not of his original derangement , but with a severe nervous fever , and a settled depression of spirits . This attack began to subside at the close of the year 1776 , though his full powers were not recovered till some time after . What he suffered is feelingly expressed in a letter to Mr. Hill . “ Other distempers only batter the walls ; but they ( nervous fevers ) creep silently into the citadel , and put the garrison to the sword . "[ 759 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 759 ]</span>See p. 36 .</p>
   <p>The death of his brother , the Rev . John Cowper , may have been instrumental to this long indisposition . At the same time we think that his situation at Olney was by no means favourable to his health ; and that more time should have been allotted for relaxation and exercise .</p>
   <p>In January , 1787 , he experienced a fresh attack , though surrounded by the beautiful scenery of Weston ; which seems to prove that local causes were not so influential as some have suggested . A much better reason may be assigned in the lamented death of his endeared friend , Mr. Unwin . This illness continued eight months , and greatly enfeebled his health and spirits . “ This last tempest , ” he remarks , in a letter to Mr. Newton , “ has left my nerves in a worse condition than it found them ; my head , especially , though better informed , is more infirm than ever . "[ 760 ] In December 1791 , Mrs. Unwin experienced her first attack ; and in May 1792 , it was renewed with aggravated symptoms , during Hayley 's visit to Weston . He describes its powerful effect on Cowper 's nerves in expressive language , and none can be more expressive than his own , at the close of the same year . “ The year ninety-two shall stand chronicled in my remembrance as the most melancholy that I have ever known , except the few weeks that I spent at Eartham . "[ 761 ] Cowper 's mental depression kept pace with the spectacle of her increasing imbecility , till at length , yielding to the pressure of these accumulating sorrows , he sank under the violence of the shock .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 760 ]</span>See p. 264 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 761 ]</span>See Letter , Dec. 26 , 1729 .</p>
   <p>The coincidence of these facts is worthy of observation , as they seem to prove that the embers of the original constitutional malady never became extinct , and required only some powerful stimulant to revive the flame . Religious feelings unquestionably concurred , because whatever predominates in the mind furnishes the materials of excitement ; but it was not the religion of a creed , for what creed ever proclaimed the delusion under which Cowper laboured .<span type="note_anchor">[ 762 ]</span>His persuasion was in opposition to his creed , for he knew that he was once saved , and yet believed that he should be lost , though his creed assured him that , where divine grace had once revealed its saving power , it never failed to perfect its work in mercy — that the Saviour 's love is unchangeable , and that whom he hath loved he loveth unto the end ( John xiii . 1 ) . His case , therefore , was an exception to his creed , and consequently must be imputed to the operation of other causes .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 762 ]</span>Cowper believed that he had incurred the Divine displeasure , because he did not commit the crime of self-destruction ; a persuasion so manifestly absurd as to afford undeniable proof of derangement .</p>
   <p>We trust we have now succeeded in tracing to its true source the origin of Cowper 's malady , and that the numerous facts which have been urged must preclude the possibility of future misconception .</p>
   <p>There are some distinguishing features in this mysterious malady which are too extraordinary not to be specified . We notice the following :—</p>
   <p>1st . The free exercise of his mental powers continued during the whole period of his depression , with the exception of two intervals , from 1773 to 1776 , and a season of eight months in the year 1787 . With these intermissions of study , all his works were written in moments of depression and unceasing nervous excitement .</p>
   <p>It still further shows the singular mechanism of his wonderful mind , that his Montes Glaciales , or Ice Islands , exhibiting decided marks of vigour of genius , were composed in the last stage of his malady — within five weeks of his decease — when his heart was lacerated by sorrow , his imagination scared by dreams , and the heavens over his head were as brass . The public papers had announced a phenomenon , which the voyages of Captains Ross and Parry have now made more familiar , viz ., the disruption of immense masses of ice in the North Pole , and their appearance in the German Ocean . Cowper seized this incident as a fit subject for his poetic powers , and produced the poem from which we make the following extract :—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="2">Unseen till now in ours , th ’ astonish 'd tide ?—</l>
     <l n="3">What view we now ? more wondrous still ! Behold !</l>
     <l n="4">Like burnish 'd brass they shine , or beaten gold ;</l>
     <l n="5">And all around the pearl 's pure splendour show ,</l>
     <l n="6">And all around the ruby 's fiery glow .</l>
     <l n="7">Come they from India , where the burning earth ,</l>

     <l n="11">No . Never such a countless , dazzling store</l>
     <l n="12">Had left , unseen , the Ganges ’ peopled shore —</l>
     <l n="13">Whence sprang they then ?</l>
     <l n="14">—— Far hence , where most severe</l>

     <l n="20">He caught , and curdled with a freezing blast</l>
     <l n="21">The current , ere it reach 'd the boundless waste .</l>
     <l n="22">By slow degrees uprose the wondrous pile</l>
     <l n="23">And long successive ages roll 'd the while ,</l>

     <l n="28">But that , though firmly fixt , supplanted yet</l>
     <l n="29">By pressure of its own enormous weight ,</l>
     <l n="30">It left the shelving beach — and , with a sound</l>

     <l n="32">Self-launch 'd , and swiftly , to the briny wave ,</l>

     <l n="37">perceptible to others .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>The Editor is enabled to state this remarkable fact on the authority of Dr. Johnson , confirmed by the testimony of Lady Throckmorton , and John Higgins , Esq ., of Turvey Abbey , formerly of Weston .</p>
   <p>There was nothing in his general manner , or intercourse with society , to excite the suspicion of the wretchedness that dwelt within . Among strangers he was at all times reserved and silent , but in the circle of familiar friends , where restraint was banished , not only did he exhibit no marks of gloom , but he could participate in the mirth of others , or inspire it from his own fertile resources of wit and humour . The prismatic colours , so to speak , were discernible through the descending shower . The bow in the heavens was not only emblematic of his imagination , but might be interpreted as the pledge of promised mercy . For it seemed to be graciously ordered that his lively and sportive imagination should be a relief to the gloomy forebodings of his mind ; and that , in vouchsafing to him this alleviation , God proclaimed , “ Behold , I do set my bow in the cloud , it shall be for a covenant between me and thee . ”</p>
   <p>3rdly . The rare union , in the same mind , of a rich vein of humour with a spirit of profound melancholy was never perhaps so strikingly exemplified as in the celebrated production of John Gilpin . The town resounded with its praises . Henderson recited it to overflowing auditories ; Mr. Henry Thornton addressed it to a large party of friends at Mr. Newton 's . Laughter might be said to hold both his sides , and the gravest were compelled to acknowledge the power of comic wit . We scarcely know a more extraordinary phenomenon than what is furnished by the history of this performance . For it appears , by the author 's own testimony , that it was written “ in the saddest mood , and but for that saddest mood , perhaps , had never been written at all . "[ 763 ] It is also known that this depression was not incidental or temporary , but a fixed and settled feeling ; that he was in fact absorbed , for the most part , in the profoundest melancholy ; that he considered himself to be cut off from the mercy of his God , though his life was blameless and without reproach ; and that , finally , having enlightened his country with strains of the sublimest morality , he died the victim of an incurable despair . As a contrast to the inimitable humour of John Gilpin , let us now turn to that most affecting representation which the poet draws of his own mental sufferings , occasioned by the painful depression which has been the subject of so many remarks .</p>

   <p>The Editor has entered thus largely into the consideration of Cowper 's depressive malady , because it has been least understood , and subject to the most erroneous misrepresentations , affecting the character of Cowper and the honour of religion . One leading object of the writer 's , in engaging in the present undertaking , has been to vindicate both from so injurious an imputation .</p>
   <p>We have now to lay before the reader another most interesting document , of which Cowper is the acknowledged author . It contains the affecting account of the last illness and peaceful end of his brother , the Rev . John Cowper , Fellow of Bennet College , Cambridge . The original manuscript was faithfully transcribed by Newton , and then published with a preface , which we have thought proper to retain . It cannot fail to be read with deep interest and edification ; and , while it is a monument of Cowper 's pious zeal and fraternal love , it is a striking record of the power of divine grace in producing that great change of heart which we deem to be essential to every professing Christian . This document is now extremely scarce , and not accessible but through private sources .<span type="note_anchor">[ 764 ]</span></p>

     <l n="1">The Editor 's motives , which induce him to publish the following</l>
     <l n="2">narrative , are chiefly two .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>First , that so striking a display of the power and mercy of God may be more generally known , to the praise and glory of his grace and the instruction and comfort of his people .</p>
   <p>Secondly , the boasted spirit of refinement , the stress laid upon unassisted human reason , and the consequent scepticism to which they lead , and which so strongly mark the character of the present times , are not now confined merely to the dupes of infidelity ; but many persons are under their influence , who would be much offended if we charged them with having renounced Christianity . While no theory is admitted in natural history , which is not confirmed by actual and positive experiment , religion is the only thing to which a trial by this test is refused . The very name of vital experimental religion excites contempt and scorn , and provokes resentment . The doctrines of regeneration by the powerful operation of the Holy Spirit , and the necessity of his continual agency and influence to advance the holiness and comforts of those in whose hearts he has already begun a work of grace , are not only exploded and contradicted by many who profess a regard for the Bible , and by some who have subscribed to the articles and liturgy of our established church , but they who avow an attachment to them are , upon that account , and that account only , considered as hypocrites or visionaries , knaves or fools .</p>
   <p>The Editor fears that many unstable persons are misled and perverted by the fine words and fair speeches of those who lie in wait to deceive . But he likewise hopes that , by the blessing of God , a candid perusal of what is here published , respecting the character , sentiments , and happy death of the late Reverend John Cowper , may convince them , some of them at least , of their mistake , and break the snare in which they have been entangled .</p>

    <head>A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF THE LATE REV . JOHN COWPER , A. M .</head>
    <head>As soon as it had pleased God , after a long and sharp season of conviction , to visit me with the consolations of his grace , it became one of my chief concerns , that my relations might be made partakers of the same mercy . In the first letter I wrote to my brother ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 765 ]</span>I took occasion to declare what God had done for my soul , and am not conscious that from that period down to his last illness I wilfully neglected an opportunity of engaging him , if it were possible , in conversation of a spiritual kind . When I left St. Alban 's , and went to visit him at Cambridge , my heart being full of the subject , I poured it out before him without reserve ; and , in all my subsequent dealings with him , so far as I was enabled , took care to show that I had received , not merely a set of notions , but a real impression of the truths of the gospel .</head>

   <p>At first I found him ready enough to talk with me upon these subjects ; sometimes he would dispute , but always without heat or animosity ; and sometimes would endeavour to reconcile the difference of our sentiments , by supposing that , at the bottom , we were both of a mind and meant the same thing .</p>
   <p>He was a man of a most candid and ingenuous spirit ; his temper remarkably sweet , and in his behaviour to me he had always manifested an uncommon affection . His outward conduct , so far as it fell under my notice , or I could learn it by the report of others , was perfectly decent and unblameable . There was nothing vicious in any part of his practice ; but , being of a studious , thoughtful turn , he placed his chief delight in the acquisition of learning , and made such acquisitions in it that he had but few rivals in that of a classical kind . He was critically skilled in the Latin , Greek , and Hebrew languages , was beginning to make himself master of the Syriac , and perfectly understood the French and Italian , the latter of which he could speak fluently . These attainments , however , and many others in the literary way , he lived heartily to despise , not as useless when sanctified and employed in the service of God , but when sought after for their own sake , and with a view to the praise of men . Learned however as he was , he was easy and cheerful in his conversation , and entirely free from the stiffness which is generally contracted by men devoted to such pursuits .</p>
   <p>Thus we spent about two years , conversing as occasion offered , and we generally visited each other once or twice a week , as long as I continued at Huntingdon , upon the leading truths of the gospel . By this time , however , he began to be more reserved ; he would hear me patiently but never reply ; and this I found , upon his own confession afterward , was the effect of a resolution he had taken , in order to avoid disputes , and to secure the continuance of that peace which had always subsisted between us . When our family removed to Olney , our intercourse became less frequent . We exchanged an annual visit , and , whenever he came amongst us , he observed the same conduct , conforming to all our customs , attending family worship with us , and heard the preaching , received civilly whatever passed in conversation upon the subject , but adhered strictly to the rule he had prescribed to himself , never remarking upon or objecting to any thing he heard or saw . This , through the goodness of his natural temper , he was enabled to carry so far that , though some things unavoidably happened which we feared would give him offence , he never took any ; for it was not possible to offer him the pulpit , nor when Mr. Newton was with us once at the time of family prayer , could we ask my brother to officiate , though , being himself a minister , and one of our own family for the time , the office seemed naturally to fall into his hands .</p>
   <p>In September 1769 , I learned by letters from Cambridge that he was dangerously ill . I set out for that place the day after I received them , and found him as ill as I expected . He had taken cold on his return from a journey into Wales ; and , lest he should be laid up at a distance from home , had pushed forward as far as he could from Bath with a fever upon him . Soon after his arrival at Cambridge he discharged , unknown to himself , such a prodigious quantity of blood , that the physician ascribed it only to the strength of his constitution that he was still alive ; and assured me , that if the discharge should be repeated , he must inevitably die upon the spot . In this state of imminent danger , he seemed to have no more concern about his spiritual interests than when in perfect health . His couch was strewed with volumes of plays , to which he had frequent recourse for amusement . I learned indeed afterwards , that , even at this time , the thoughts of God and eternity would often force themselves upon his mind ; but , not apprehending his life to be in danger , and trusting in the morality of his past conduct , he found it no difficult matter to thrust them out again .</p>
   <p>As it pleased God that he had no relapse , he presently began to recover strength , and in ten days ’ time I left him so far restored , that he could ride many miles without fatigue , and had every symptom of returning health . It is probable , however , that though his recovery seemed perfect , this illness was the means which God had appointed to bring down his strength in the midst of his journey , and to hasten on the malady which proved his last .</p>
   <p>On the 16th of February , 1770 , I was again summoned to attend him , by letters which represented him as so ill that the physician entertained but little hopes of his recovery . I found him afflicted with asthma and dropsy , supposed to be the effect of an imposthume in his liver . He was , however , cheerful when I first arrived , expressed great joy at seeing me , thought himself much better than he had been , and seemed to flatter himself with hopes that he should be well again . My situation at this time was truly distressful . I learned from the physician , that , in this instance as in the last , he was in much greater danger than he suspected . He did not seem to lay his illness at all to heart , nor could I find by his conversation that he had one serious thought . As often as a suitable occasion offered , when we were free from company and interruption , I endeavoured to give a spiritual turn to the discourse ; and , the day after my arrival , asked his permission to pray with him , to which he readily consented . I renewed my attempts in this way as often as I could , though without any apparent success : still he seemed as careless and unconcerned as ever ; yet I could not but consider his willingness in this instance as a token for good , and observed with pleasure , that though at other times he discovered no mark of seriousness , yet when I spoke to him of the Lord 's dealings with myself , he received what I said with affection , would press my hand , and look kindly at me , and seemed to love me the better for it .</p>
   <p>On the 21st of the same month he had a violent fit of the asthma , which seized him when he rose , about an hour before noon , and lasted all the day . His agony was dreadful . Having never seen any person afflicted in the same way , I could not help fearing that he would be suffocated ; nor was the physician himself without fears of the same kind . This day the Lord was very present with me , and enabled me , as I sat by the poor sufferer 's side , to wrestle for a blessing upon him . I observed to him , that though it had pleased God to visit him with great afflictions , yet mercy was mingled with the dispensation . I said , “ You have many friends , who love you , and are willing to do all they can to serve you ; and so perhaps have others in the like circumstances ; but it is not the lot of every sick man , how much soever he may be beloved , to have a friend that can pray for him . ” He replied , “ That is true , and I hope God will have mercy upon me . ” His love for me from this time became very remarkable ; there was a tenderness in it more than was merely natural ; and he generally expressed it by calling for blessings upon me in the most affectionate terms , and with a look and manner not to be described . At night , when he was quite worn out with the fatigue of labouring for breath , and could get no rest , his asthma still continuing , he turned to me and said , with a melancholy air , “ Brother , I seem to be marked out for misery ; you know some people are so . ” That moment I felt my heart enlarged , and such a persuasion of the love of God towards him was wrought in my soul , that I replied with confidence , and , as if I had authority given me to say it , “ But that is not your case ; you are marked out for mercy . ” Through the whole of this most painful dispensation , he was blessed with a degree of patience and resignation to the will of God , not always seen in the behaviour of established Christians under sufferings so great as his . I never heard a murmuring word escape him ; on the contrary , he would often say , when his pains were most acute , “ I only wish it may please God to enable me to suffer without complaining ; I have no right to complain . ” Once he said , with a loud voice , “ Let thy rod and thy staff support and comfort me : ” and “ Oh that it were with me as in times past , when the candle of the Lord shone upon my tabernacle ! ” One evening , when I had been expressing my hope that the Lord would show him mercy , he replied , “ I hope he will ; I am sure I pretend to nothing . ” Many times he spoke of himself in terms of the greatest self-abasement , which I cannot now particularly remember . I thought I could discern , in these expressions , the glimpses of approaching day , and have no doubt at present but that the Spirit of God was gradually preparing him , in a way of true humiliation , for that bright display of gospel-grace which he was soon after pleased to afford him .<span type="note_anchor">[ 766 ]</span></p>

   <p>“ As when a felon whom his country 's laws , ” &amp; c .</p>
   <p>On Saturday the 10th of March , about three in the afternoon , he suddenly burst into tears , and said with a loud cry , “ Oh , forsake me not ! ” I went to his bed-side , when he grasped my hand , and presently , by his eyes and countenance , I found that he was in prayer . Then turning to me he said , “ Oh brother , I am full of what I could say to you . ” The nurse asked him if he would have any hartshorn or lavender . He replied , “ None of these things will serve my purpose . ” I said , “ But I know what would , my dear , do n't I ? ” He answered , “ You do , brother . ”</p>
   <p>Having continued some time silent , he said , “ Behold , I create new heavens and a new earth , ” — then , after a pause , “ Ay , and he is able to do it too . ”</p>
   <p>I left him for about an hour , fearing lest he should fatigue himself with talking , and because my surprise and joy were so great that I could hardly bear them . When I returned , he threw his arms about my neck , and , leaning his head against mine , he said , “ Brother , if I live , you and I shall be more like one another than we have been . But whether I live or live not , all is well , and will be so ; I know it will ; I have felt that which I never felt before ; and am sure that God has visited me with this sickness to teach me what I was too proud to learn in health . I never had satisfaction till now . The doctrines I had been used to referred me to myself for the foundation of my hopes , and there I could find nothing to rest upon . The sheet-anchor of the soul was wanting . I thought you wrong , yet wished to believe as you did . I found myself unable to believe , yet always thought that I should one day be brought to do so . You suffered more than I have done , before you believed these truths ; but our sufferings , though different in their kind and measure , were directed to the same end . I hope he has taught me that , which he teaches none but his own . I hope so . These things were foolishness to me once , but now I have a firm foundation , and am satisfied . ”</p>
   <p>In the evening , when I went to bid him good night , he looked stedfastly in my face , and , with great solemnity in his air and manner , taking me by the hand , resumed the discourse in these very words : “ As empty , and yet full ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things — I see the rock upon which I once split , and I see the rock of my salvation . I have peace in myself , and if I live I hope it will be that I may be made a messenger of peace to others . I have learned that in a moment , which I could not have learned by reading many books for many years . I have often studied these points , and studied them with great attention , but was blinded by prejudice ; and , unless He , who alone is worthy to unloose the seals , had opened the book to me , I had been blinded still . Now they appear so plain , that though I am convinced no comment could ever have made me understand them , I wonder I did not see them before . Yet , great as my doubts and difficulties were , they have only served to pave the way , and being solved they make it plainer . The light I have received comes late , but it is a comfort to me that I never made the gospel-truths a subject of ridicule . Though I dissented from the persuasion and the ways of God 's people , I ever thought them respectable , and therefore not proper to be made a jest of . The evil I suffer is the consequence of my descent from the corrupt original stock , and of my own personal transgressions ; the good I enjoy comes to me as the overflowing of his bounty ; but the crown of all his mercies is this , that he has given me a Saviour , and not only the Saviour of mankind , brother , but my Saviour .</p>
   <p>“ I should delight to see the people at Olney , but am not worthy to appear amongst them . ” He wept at speaking these words , and repeated them with emphasis . “ I should rejoice in an hour 's conversation with Mr. Newton , and , if I live , shall have much discourse with him upon these subjects , but am so weak in body , that at present I could not bear it . ” At the same time he gave me to understand , that he had been five years inquiring after the truth , that is , from the time of my first visit to him after I left St. Albans , and that , from the very day of his ordination , which was ten years ago , he had been dissatisfied with his own views of the gospel , and sensible of their defect and obscurity ; that he had always had a sense of the importance of the ministerial charge , and had used to consider himself accountable for his doctrine no less than his practice ; that he could appeal to the Lord for his sincerity in all that time , and had never wilfully erred , but always been desirous of coming to the knowledge of the truth . He added , that the moment when he sent forth that cry<span type="note_anchor">[ 767 ]</span>was the moment when light was darted into his soul ; that he had thought much about these things in the course of his illness , but never till that instant was able to understand them .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 767 ]</span>On the 10th of March , vide supra .</p>
   <p>It was remarkable that , from the very instant when he was first enlightened , he was also wonderfully strengthened in body , so that from the tenth to the fourteenth of March we all entertained hopes of his recovery . He was himself very sanguine in his expectations of it , but frequently said that his desire of recovery extended no farther than his hope of usefulness ; adding , “ Unless I may live to be an instrument of good to others , it were better for me to die now . ”</p>
   <p>As his assurance was clear and unshaken , so he was very sensible of the goodness of the Lord to him in that respect . On the day when his eyes were opened , he turned to me , and , in a low voice , said , “ What a mercy it is to a man in my condition to know his acceptance ! I am completely satisfied of mine . ” On another occasion , speaking to the same purpose , he said , “ This bed would be a bed of misery , and it is so — but it is likewise a bed of joy and a bed of discipline . Was I to die this night , I know I should be happy . This assurance I hope is quite consistent with the word of God . It is built upon a sense of my own utter insufficiency , and the all-sufficiency of Christ . ” At the same time he said , “ Brother , I have been building my glory upon a sandy foundation ; I have laboured night and day to perfect myself in things of no profit ; I have sacrificed my health to these pursuits , and am now suffering the consequence of my misspent labour . But how contemptible do the writers I once highly valued now appear to me ! ‘ Yea , doubtless , I count all things loss and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord . ’ I must now go to a new school . I have many things to learn . I succeeded in my former pursuits . I wanted to be highly applauded , and I was so . I was flattered up to the height of my wishes : now , I must learn a new lesson . ”</p>
   <p>On the evening of the thirteenth , he said , “ What comfort have I in this bed , miserable as I seem to be ! Brother , I love to look at you . I see now who was right , and who was mistaken . But it seems wonderful that such a dispensation should be necessary to enforce what seems so very plain . I wish myself at Olney ; you have a good river there , better than all the rivers of Damascus . What a scene is passing before me ! Ideas upon these subjects crowd upon me faster than I can give them utterance . How plain do many texts appear , to which , after consulting all the commentators , I could hardly affix a meaning ; and now I have their true meaning without any comment at all . There is but one key to the New Testament ; there is but one interpreter . I cannot describe to you , nor shall ever be able to describe , what I felt in the moment when it was given to me . May I make a good use of it ! How I shudder when I think of the danger I have just escaped ! I had made up my mind upon these subjects , and was determined to hazard all upon the justness of my own opinions . ”</p>
   <p>Speaking of his illness , he said , he had been followed night and day from the very beginning of it with this text : I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the Lord . This notice was fulfilled to him , though not in such a sense as my desires of his recovery prompted me to put upon it . His remarkable amendment soon appeared to be no more than a present supply of strength and spirits , that he might be able to speak of the better life which God had given him , which was no sooner done than he relapsed as suddenly as he had revived . About this time he formed a purpose of receiving the sacrament , induced to it principally by a desire of setting his seal to the truth , in presence of those who were strangers to the change which had taken place in his sentiments . It must have been administered to him by the Master of the College , to whom he designed to have made this short declaration , “ If I die , I die in the belief of the doctrines of the Reformation , and of the Church of England , as it was at the time of the Reformation . ” But , his strength declining apace , and his pains becoming more severe , he could never find a proper opportunity of doing it . His experience was rather peace than joy , if a distinction may be made between joy and that heartfelt peace which he often spoke of in the most comfortable terms ; and which he expressed by a heavenly smile upon his countenance under the bitterest bodily distress . His words upon this subject once were these — “ How wonderful is it that God should look upon man , especially that he should look upon me ! Yet he sees me , and takes notice of all that I suffer . I see him too ; he is present before me , and I hear him say , Come unto me , all ye that are weary and heavy laden , and I will give you rest . ” Matt . xi . 28 .</p>
   <p>On the fourteenth , in the afternoon , I perceived that the strength and spirits which had been afforded him were suddenly withdrawn , so that by the next day his mind became weak , and his speech roving and faltering . But still , at intervals , he was enabled to speak of divine things with great force and clearness . On the evening of the fifteenth , he said , “ ‘ There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance . ’ That text has been sadly misunderstood by me as well as by others . Where is that just person to be found ? Alas ! what must have become of me , if I had died this day se'nnight ? What should I have had to plead ? My own righteousness ! That would have been of great service to me , to be sure . Well , whither next ? Why , to the mountains to fall upon us , and to the hills to cover us . I am not duly thankful for the mercy I have received . Perhaps I may ascribe some part of my insensibility to my great weakness of body . I hope at least that if I was better in health , it would be better with me in these respects also . ”</p>
   <p>The next day , perceiving that his understanding began to suffer by the extreme weakness of his body , he said , “ I have been vain of my understanding and of my acquirements in this place ; and now God has made me little better than an idiot , as much as to say , now be proud if you can . Well , while I have any senses left , my thoughts will be poured out in the praise of God . I have an interest in Christ , in his blood and sufferings , and my sins are forgiven me . Have I not cause to praise him ? When my understanding fails me quite , as I think it will soon , then he will pity my weakness . ”</p>
   <p>Though the Lord intended that his warfare should be short , yet a warfare he was to have , and to be exposed to a measure of conflict with his own corruptions . His pain being extreme , his powers of recollection much impaired , and the Comforter withholding for a season his sensible support , he was betrayed into a fretfulness and impatience of spirit which had never been permitted to show itself before . This appearance alarmed me , and , having an opportunity afforded me by everybody 's absence , I said to him , “ You were happier last Saturday than you are to-day . Are you entirely destitute of the consolations you then spoke of ? And do you not sometimes feel comfort flowing into your heart from a sense of your acceptance with God ? ” He replied , “ Sometimes I do , but sometimes I am left to desperation . ” The same day , in the evening , he said , “ Brother , I believe you are often uneasy , lest what lately passed should come to nothing . ” I replied by asking him , whether , when he found his patience and his temper fail , he endeavoured to pray for power against his corruptions ? He answered , “ Yes , a thousand times in a day . But I see myself odiously vile and wicked . If I die in this illness , I beg you will place no other inscription over me than such as may just mention my name and the parish where I was minister ; for that I ever had a being , and what sort of a being I had , cannot be too soon forgot . I was just beginning to be a deist , and had long desired to be so ; and I will own to you what I never confessed before , that my function and the duties of it were a weariness to me which I could not bear . Yet , wretched creature and beast as I was , I was esteemed religious , though I lived without God in the world . ” About this time , I reminded him of the account of Janeway , which he once read at my desire . He said he had laughed at it in his own mind , and accounted it mere madness and folly . “ Yet base as I am , ” said he , “ I have no doubt now but God has accepted me also , and forgiven me all my sins . ”</p>
   <p>I then asked him what he thought of my narrative ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 768 ]</span>He replied , “ I thought it strange , and ascribed much of it to the state in which you had been . When I came to visit you in London , and found you in that deep distress , I would have given the universe to have administered some comfort to you . You may remember that I tried every method of doing it . When I found that all my attempts were vain , I was shocked to the greatest degree . I began to consider your sufferings as a judgment upon you , and my inability to alleviate them as a judgment upon myself . When Mr. M.<span type="note_anchor">[ 769 ]</span>came , he succeeded in a moment . This surprised me ; but it does not surprise me now . He had the key to your heart , which I had not . That which filled me with disgust against my office as a minister , was the same ill success which attended me in my own parish . There I endeavoured to soothe the afflicted , and to reform the unruly by warning and reproof ; but all that I could say in either case was spoken to the wind , and attended with no effect . ”</p>

   <p>There is that in the nature of salvation by grace , when it is truly and experimentally known , which prompts every person to think himself the most extraordinary instance of its power . Accordingly , my brother insisted upon the precedence in this respect ; and , upon comparing his case with mine , would by no means allow my deliverance to have been so wonderful as his own . He observed that , from the beginning , both his manner of life and his connexions had been such as had a natural tendency to blind his eyes , and to confirm and rivet his prejudices against the truth . Blameless in his outward conduct , and having no open immorality to charge himself with , his acquaintance had been with men of the same stamp , who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised the doctrines of the cross . Such were all who , from his earliest days , he had been used to propose to himself as patterns for his imitation . Not to go farther back , such was the clergyman under whom he received the first rudiments of his education ; such was the schoolmaster , under whom he was prepared for the University ; and such were all the most admired characters there , with whom he was most ambitious of being connected . He lamented the dark and Christless condition of the place , where learning and morality were all in all , and where , if a man was possessed of these qualifications , he neither doubted himself , nor did any body else question , the safety of his state . He concluded , therefore , that to show the fallacy of such appearances , and to root out the prejudices which long familiarity with them had fastened upon his mind , required a more than ordinary exertion of divine power , and that the grace of God was more clearly manifested in such a work than in the conversion of one like me , who had no outside righteousness to boast of , and who , if I was ignorant of the truth , was not , however , so desperately prejudiced against it .</p>
   <p>His thoughts , I suppose , had been led to this subject , when , one afternoon , while I was writing by the fire-side , he thus addressed himself to the nurse , who sat at his bolster . “ Nurse , I have lived three-and-thirty years , and I will tell you how I have spent them . When I was a boy , they taught me Latin ; and because I was the son of a gentleman , they taught me Greek . These I learned under a sort of private tutor ; at the age of fourteen , or thereabouts , they sent me to a public school , where I learned more Latin and Greek , and , last of all , to this place , where I have been learning more Latin and Greek still . Now has not this been a blessed life , and much to the glory of God ? ” Then directing his speech to me , he said , “ Brother , I was going to say I was born in such a year ; but I correct myself : I would rather say , in such a year I came into the world . You know when I was born . ”</p>
   <p>As long as he expected to recover , the souls committed to his care were much upon his mind . One day , when none was present but myself , he prayed thus :— “ O Lord , thou art good ; goodness is thy very essence , and thou art the fountain of wisdom . I am a poor worm , weak and foolish as a child . Thou hast entrusted many souls unto me ; and I have not been able to teach them , because I knew thee not myself . Grant me ability , O Lord , for I can do nothing without thee , and give me grace to be faithful . ”</p>
   <p>In a time of severe and continual pain , he smiled in my face , and said , “ Brother , I am as happy as a king . ” And , the day before he died , when I asked him what sort of a night he had had , he replied , a “ sad night , not a wink of sleep . ” I said , “ Perhaps , though , your mind has been composed , and you have been enabled to pray ? ” “ Yes , ” said he , “ I have endeavoured to spend the hours in the thoughts of God and prayer ; I have been much comforted , and all the comfort I got came to me in this way . ”</p>
   <p>The next morning I was called up to be witness of his last moments . I found him in a deep sleep , lying perfectly still , and seemingly free from pain . I stayed with him till they pressed me to quit the room , and in about five minutes after I had left him he died ; sooner , indeed , than I expected , though for some days there had been no hopes of his recovery . His death at that time was rather extraordinary ; at least , I thought it so ; for , when I took leave of him the night before , he did not seem worse or weaker than he had been , and , for aught that appeared , might have lasted many days ; but the Lord , in whose sight the death of his saints is precious , cut short his sufferings , and gave him a speedy and peaceful departure .</p>
   <p>He died at seven in the morning , on the 20th of March , 1770 .</p>

   <p>The fraternal love and piety of Cowper are beautifully illustrated in this most interesting document . No sooner had he experienced the value of religion , and its inward peace and hope , in his own heart , than he feels solicitous to communicate the blessing to others . True piety is always diffusive . It does not , like the sordid miser , hoard up the treasure for self-enjoyment , but is enriched by giving , and impoverished only by withholding .</p>

   <p>The prejudices of his brother , and yet his mild and amiable spirit of forbearance ; the zeal of Cowper , and its final happy result , impart to this narrative a singular degree of interest . Others would have been deterred by apparent difficulties ; but true zeal is full of faith , as well as of love , and does not contemplate man 's resistance but God 's mighty power .</p>
   <p>The example of John Cowper furnishes also a remarkable evidence that a man may be distinguished by the highest endowments of human learning , and yet be ignorant of that knowledge which is emphatically called life eternal .</p>
   <p>The distinction between the knowledge that is derived from books and the wisdom that cometh from above , is drawn by Cowper with a happy and just discrimination .</p>

   <p>It is important to know how far the powers of human reason extend in matters of religion , and where they fail . Reason can examine the claims of a divine revelation , and determine its authority by the most conclusive arguments . It can expose error , and establish the truth ; attack infidelity within its own entrenchments , and carry its victorious arms into the very camp of the enemy . It can defend all the outworks of religion , and vindicate its insulted majesty . But at this point its powers begin to fail . It cannot confer a spiritual apprehension of the truth in the understanding , nor a spiritual reception of it in the heart . This is the province of grace . “ No man knoweth the things of God , but the Spirit of God , and he to whom the Spirit hath revealed them . ” “ Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , saith the Lord . ” Men of learning endeavour to attain to the knowledge of divine things , in the same manner as they acquire an insight into human things , that is , by human power and human teaching . Whereas divine things require a divine power and divine teaching . “ All thy children shall be taught of God . ” Not that human reason is superseded in its use . Man is always a rational and moral agent . But it is reason , conscious of its own weakness , simple in its views , and humble in its spirit , enlightened , guided , and regulated in all its researches by the grace and wisdom that is from above . John Cowper expresses the substance of this idea in the following emphatic words :— “ I have learned that in a moment , which I could not have learned by reading many books for many years . I have often studied these points , and studied them with great attention , but was blinded by prejudice ; and unless He , who alone is worthy to unloose the seals , had opened the book to me , I had been blinded still . ”</p>
   <p>The information supplied respecting John Cowper by preceding biographers is brief and scanty . The following are the particulars which the Editor has succeeded in obtaining . John Cowper was considered to be one of the best scholars in the university of Cambridge . In 1759 he obtained the Chancellor 's gold medal , and in 1762 gained both the prizes for Masters of Arts . He was subsequently elected Fellow of Bennet , and became private tutor to to Lord Walsingham . He translated the four first books of the Henriade ; his brother William , it is said , the four next ( Hayley states two cantos only , and alleges Cowper 's own authority for the fact ) ; E. B. Greene , Esq ., a relative of Dr. Greene , the master of the college ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 770 ]</span>the ninth , and Robert Lloyd the tenth book . It appeared in Smollett 's edition , in 1762 , but the writer has not been able to procure a copy . He afterwards engaged in an edition of Apollonius Rhodius ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 771 ]</span>when his sedentary and studious habits produced an imposthume in the liver , which brought him to his grave in the thirty-third year of his age . He was buried at Foxton in Cambridgeshire , of which place he was rector .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 770 ]</span>He was afterwards Bishop of Lincoln .</p>

   <p>“ We have lost the best classic and most liberal thinker in our university , Cowper of Ben'et . He sat so long at his studies , that the posture gave rise to an abscess in his liver , and he fell a victim to learning . The goddess has so few votaries here , that she resolved to take the best offering we had , and she employed Apollonius Rhodius to strike the blow . I write the author again , Apollonius Rhodius . Cowper had laboured hard at an edition of him for several years , and applied so much to his favourite author , that it cost his life . I shall make a bold push for his papers . Yet , what omens I have ! Melancthon did but think of a translation , and he died . Hoeltzlinus owns he wrote the latter part of the annotations , manu lassissimâ et corpore imbecillo , and died before he put the last hand to them . Cowper collates all the editions , makes a new translation , and follows his predecessors . One would think that by some unknown fate , or by some curse of his master , Callimachus , our poet was doomed to remain in obscurity . His enemies may say , that the dulness of his verses bears some resemblance to the torpedo , and benumbs or kills whatever touches it . ” — See Dr. Parr 's Works , vol . vii . p. 75 .</p>

    <head>TO THE REV . WILLIAM UNWIN .</head>
     <l n="1">March 31 , 1770 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— I am glad that the Lord made you a fellow labourer with us in praying my dear brother out of darkness into light . It was a blessed work ; and when it shall be your turn to die in the Lord , and to rest from all your labours , that work shall follow you . I once entertained hopes of his recovery : from the moment when it pleased God to give him light in his soul , there was , for four days , such a visible amendment in his body as surprised us all . Dr. Glynn himself was puzzled , and began to think that all his threatening conjectures would fail of their accomplishment . I am well satisfied that it was thus ordered , not for his own sake , but for the sake of us , who had been so deeply concerned for his spiritual welfare , that he might be able to give such evident proof of the work of God upon his soul as should leave no doubt behind it . As to his friends at Cambridge , they knew nothing of the matter . He never spoke of these things but to myself ; nor to me , when others were within hearing , except that he sometimes would speak in the presence of the nurse . He knew well to make the distinction between those who could understand him and those who could not ; and that he was not in circumstances to maintain such a controversy as a declaration of his new views and sentiments would have exposed him to . Just after his death , I spoke of this change to a dear friend of his , a fellow of the college , who had attended him through all his sickness with assiduity and tenderness . But he did not understand me .</p>
   <p>I now proceed to mention such particulars as I can recollect ; and which I had not opportunity to insert in my letters to Olney ; for I left Cambridge suddenly , and sooner than I expected . He was deeply impressed with a sense of the difficulties he should have to encounter , if it should please God to raise him again . He saw the necessity of being faithful , and the opposition he should expose himself to by being so . Under the weight of these thoughts , he one day broke out in the following prayer , when only myself was with him . “ O Lord , thou art light ; and in thee is no darkness at all . Thou art the fountain of all wisdom , and it is essential to thee to be good and gracious . I am a child ; O Lord , teach me how I shall conduct myself ! Give me the wisdom of the serpent with the harmlessness of the dove ! Bless the souls thou hast committed to the care of thy helpless miserable creature , who has no wisdom or knowledge of his own , and make me faithful to them , for thy mercy 's sake ! ” Another time he said , “ How wonderful it is , that God should look upon man ; and how much more wonderful that he should look upon such a worm as I am ! Yet he does look upon me , and takes the exactest notice of all my sufferings . He is present , and I see him ( I mean , by faith ) , and he stretches out his arms towards me , ” — and he then stretched out his own — “ and he says , ‘ Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden , and I will give you rest ! ’ ” He smiled and wept , when he spoke these words . When he expressed himself upon these subjects , there was a weight and dignity in his manner such as I never saw before . He spoke with the greatest deliberation , making a pause at the end of every sentence ; and there was something in his air and in the tone of his voice inexpressibly solemn , unlike himself , unlike what I had ever seen in another .</p>
   <p>This had God wrought . I have praised him for his marvellous act , and have felt a joy of heart upon the subject of my brother 's death , such as I never felt but in my own conversion . He is now before the throne ; and yet a little while and we shall meet , never more to be divided . Yours , my very dear friend , with my affectionate respects to yourself and yours ,</p>
   <p>W. C .</p>
   <p>Postscript .— A day or two before his death , he grew so weak and was so very ill , that he required continual attendance , so that he had neither strength nor opportunity to say much to me . Only the day before , he said he had had a sleepless , but a composed and quiet night . I asked him , if he had been able to collect his thoughts . He replied , “ All night long I have endeavoured to think upon God and to continue in prayer . I had great peace and comfort ; and what comfort I had came in that way . ” When I saw him the next morning at seven o'clock he was dying , fast asleep , and exempted , in all appearance , from the sense of those pangs which accompany dissolution . I shall be glad to hear from you , my dear friend , when you can find time to write , and are so inclined . The death of my beloved brother teems with many useful lessons . May God seal the instruction upon our hearts !</p>
   <p>Besides the documents already inserted , Cowper translated the narrative of Mr. Van Lier , a minister of the Reformed Church , at the Cape of Good Hope . Mr. Van Lier was born in Holland , in the year 1764 ; his mother was pious , and brought him up in the principles of true religion , endeavouring from his early youth to direct his mind to the ministry . After the usual course of education , he entered at the University , where , though he did not neglect his studies , he forgot his God . His talents seem to have been considerable , his imagination ardent , but his passions not under sufficient control ; and , with all the elements that might have formed a great character , by the misapplication of his time , opportunities , and faculties , he became vicious , and subsequently a sceptic . God , in mercy , exercised him with a series of trials , but the impression was always ultimately effaced — till at length the blow reached him which lacerated his heart , extinguished all his hopes of earthly happiness , and thus finally brought him to God . Among the excellent books that contributed to dispel his errors , he specified the “ Cardiphonia ” of Newton with grateful acknowledgment . It is justly considered the best of all his works , and has been made eminently useful . Mr. Van Lier subsequently wrote a narrative , in Latin , containing an account of his conversion , and of all the remarkable events of his life . This narrative he addressed to Newton , at whose request it was translated by Cowper . It was published under the title of “ The Power of Grace illustrated . ” Interesting as are its contents , yet , as they comprise nearly two hundred pages , we find it impossible to allow space for its insertion , though it is well entitled to appear in a separate form .</p>
   <p>He concludes his narrative in these words : “ O happy and glorious hour , when I shall be delivered from all trouble and sin , from this body of death , from the wicked world , and from the snares of Satan ! when I shall appear before my Saviour without spot , and shall so behold his glory , and be filled with his presence , as to be wholly and for ever engaged in adoration , admiration , gratitude , and love ! ”</p>
   <p>As we are now drawing towards the conclusion of this undertaking , some reference is due to names once honoured by Cowper 's friendship , and perpetuated in his works . A distinguished place is due to the Rev . William Cawthorne Unwin . His death has been recorded in a former volume , as well as his burial in the cathedral at Winchester . A Latin epitaph was composed on this occasion by Cowper , but objected to by a relative of the family , because it adverted to his mother 's early prayers that God might incline his heart to the ministry . We subjoin the epitaph which replaced the pious and classical composition of Cowper .</p>
   <p>IN MEMORY OF THE REV . WILLIAM CAWTHORNE UNWIN , M. A . RECTOR OF STOCK , IN ESSEX .</p>

Dr. Crusius ; and , having gone through the education of that school , he was at an early period admitted to Christ 's College , Cambridge .

   <p>And is this the memorial of the interesting and pious Unwin ? Shall no monumental tablet record that he was “ the endeared and valued friend of Cowper ? ” We have seldom seen so cold and jejune an epitaph to commemorate a man distinguished by so many virtues , and associated with such interesting recollections . We are happy in being enabled to furnish a testimony more worthy of him in the following letter , addressed by Cowper to the present Lord Carrington .</p>

   <p>My dear Sir ,— We have indeed suffered a great loss by the death of our friend Unwin ; and the shock that attended it was the more severe , as till within a few hours of his decease there seemed to be no very alarming symptoms . All the account that we received from Mr. Henry Thornton , who acted like a true friend on the occasion , and with a tenderness toward all concerned that does him great honour , encouraged our hopes of his recovery ; and Mrs. Unwin herself found him on her arrival at Winchester so cheerful , and in appearance so likely to live , that her letter also seemed to promise us all that we could wish on the subject . But an unexpected turn in his distemper , which suddenly seized his bowels , dashed all our hopes , and deprived us almost immediately of a man whom we must ever regret . His mind having been from his infancy deeply tinctured with religious sentiments , he was always impressed with a sense of the importance of the great change of all ; and , on former occasions , when at any time he found himself indisposed , was consequently subject to distressing alarms and apprehensions . But in this last instance his mind was from the first composed and easy ; his fears were taken away , and succeeded by such a resignation as warrants us in saying , “ that God made all his bed in his sickness . ” I believe it is always thus , where the heart , though upright toward God , as Unwin 's assuredly was , is yet troubled with the fear of death . When death indeed comes , he is either welcome , or at least has lost his sting .</p>
   <p>I have known many such instances , and his mother , from the moment that she learned with what tranquillity he was favoured in his last illness , for that very reason expected it would be his last . Yet not with so much certainty , but that the favourable accounts of him at length , in a great measure , superseded that persuasion .</p>
   <p>She begs me to assure you , my dear sir , how sensible she is , as well as myself , of the kindness of your inquiries . She suffers this stroke , not with more patience and submission than expected , for I never knew her hurried by any affliction into the loss of either , but in appearance at least , and at present , with less injury to health than I apprehended . She observed to me , after reading your kind letter , that , though it was a proof of the greatness of her loss , yet it afforded her pleasure , though a melancholy one , to see how much her son had been loved and valued by such a person as yourself .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin wrote to her daughter-in-law , to invite her and the family hither , hoping that a change of scene , and a situation so pleasant as this , may be of service to her , but we have not yet received her answer . I have good hope , however , that , great as her affliction must be , she will yet be able to support it , for she well knows whither to resort for consolation .</p>
   <p>The virtues and amiable qualities of our friends are the things for which we most wish to keep them ; but they are , on the other hand , the very things that in particular ought to reconcile us to their departure . We find ourselves sometimes connected with , and engaged in affection , too , to a person of whose readiness and fitness for another life we cannot have the highest opinion . The death of such men has a bitterness in it , both to themselves and survivors , which , thank God ! is not to be found in the death of Unwin .</p>
   <p>I know , my dear sir , how much you valued him , and I know also , how much he valued you . With respect to him , all is well ; and of you , if I should survive you , which perhaps , is not very probable , I shall say the same .</p>
   <p>In the meantime , believe me , with the warmest wishes for your health and happiness , and with Mrs. Unwin 's affectionate respects ,</p>
   <p>Yours , my dear sir , Most faithfully , W. C .</p>
   <p>Joseph Hill , Esq ., survived Cowper many years , and lived to an advanced age . He formerly resided in Great Queen Street , and afterwards in Saville Row , and was eminent in his profession . His widow survived him , and died in the year 1824 . The letters addressed to him by Cowper were arranged by Dr. Johnson , and ornamented with a suitable binding . They were finally left as an heir-loom at Wargrave , near Henley . Joseph Jekyll , Esq ., the barrister , once celebrated for his wit and humour , succeeded to that property , and still survives at the moment in which we are writing .</p>
   <p>Samuel Rose , Esq ., after a comparatively short career of professional eminence , was seized with a rheumatic fever , which he caught at Horsham , in attending the Sussex sessions , in 1804 . He died in the thirty-eighth year of his age , declaring to those around him , “ I have lived long enough to review my grounds for confidence , and I have unspeakable comfort in assuring those I love that I am daily more reconciled in leaving the world now than at a later period . ”</p>
   <p>Cowper 's sentiments of him are expressed in the following letter .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO JOSEPH HILL , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Weston-Underwood , Dec. 2 , 1788 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>My dear Friend ,— I told you lately , that I had an ambition to introduce to your acquaintance my valuable friend , Mr. Rose . He is now before you . You will find him a person of genteel manners and agreeable conversation . As to his other virtues and good qualities , which are many , and such as are not often found in men of his years , I consign them over to your own discernment , perfectly sure , that none of them will escape you . I give you joy of each other , and remain , my dear old friend , most truly yours ,</p>

   <p>In recalling the name of Lady Austen , it is sufficient to entitle her to grateful remembrance , that it is to her we are indebted for the first suggestion of the poem of “ The Task , ” that lasting monument of the fame of Cowper . It has also been recorded that she subsequently furnished the materials for the story of John Gilpin .</p>
   <p>Her maiden name was Richardson ; she was married very early in life to Sir Robert Austen , Baronet , and resided with him in France , where he died . After this event , she lived with her sister Mrs. Jones , the wife of the Rev . Mr. Jones , minister of Clifton , near Olney . It was thus that her intercourse commenced with Cowper . In a subsequent period , she was married to a native of France , M. de Tardif , a gentleman , and a poet , who has expressed , in some elegant French verses , his just and deep sense of her accomplished , endearing character . In visiting Paris with him in the course of the summer of 1802 , she sank under the fatigue of the excursion , and died in that city on the 12th of August . It is due to the memory of this lady to rescue her name from a surmise injurious to her sincerity and honour ; and the Editor rejoices that he possesses the means of affording her , what he conceives to be an ample justification . In the published correspondence of the late respected Alexander Knox , Esq ., a doubt is expressed how far she is not chargeable with endeavouring to supplant Mrs. Unwin in the affections of Cowper . It is already recorded that a breach occurred between the two ladies , and that the poet , with a sensitiveness and delicacy that reflect the highest credit on his feelings and judgment , relinquished the society of Lady Austen from that period . They never met again . There is no direct charge conveyed by Mr. Knox , but there is evidently expressed the language of doubt and surmise . Local impressions are often the best interpretation of questionable occurrences . With this view the Editor has endeavoured to trace the nature of the rupture , on the spot , by a communication with surviving parties . From these sources of inquiry it appears that Lady Austen was a woman of great wit and vivacity , and possessed the power of exciting much interest by her manner and conversation — that Mrs. Unwin , who was of a more sedate and quiet character , seeing the ascendency that Lady Austen thus acquired , became jealous , and that a rupture was the consequence . Mr. Andrews , an intelligent inhabitant of Olney , who is my informant , assured me that such was the substance of the case , and that the rest was mere surmise and conjecture . On my asking him whether he knew the impressions on Mr. Scott 's mind with regard to this event , he added , “ that he himself asked Mr. Scott the question , and that his reply was , ‘ Who can be surprised that two women should be continually in the society of one man , and quarrel sooner or later with each other ? ’ ” The blunt and honest reply of Mr. Scott we apprehend to be the best commentary on the transaction . There may be jealousies in friendship as well as in love ; and the possibility of female rivalship is sufficient to account for the rupture , without the intervention of either friendship or love .</p>
   <p>From Mrs. Livius , of Bedford , formerly Miss Barham ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 776 ]</span>and intimate with Newton , Cowper , and Lady Austen , I learn that , though the vivacity and manner of Lady Austen weakened the belief of the depth of her personal religion , yet Mrs. Livius never entertained any doubt of its reality . Her own deep personal piety during a long life , and her just discrimination of character , are sufficient to give weight and authority to her judgment .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 776 ]</span>Sister of the late Joseph Foster Barham , Esq . I cannot mention this endeared character , with whom I have the privilege of being so nearly connected , without recording my affectionate regard , and high estimation of her piety and virtues .</p>
   <p>I take this opportunity of expressing her conviction that the loss of Lady Austen 's society was a great privation to Cowper ; that she both enlivened his spirits and stimulated his genius , and that the jealousy of Mrs. Unwin operated injuriously by compelling him to relinquish so innocent a source of gratification . Hayley , in some lines written on the occasion of her death , speaks of her as one who</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Wak 'd in a poet inspiration 's flame ;</l>
     <l n="2">Sent the freed eagle in the sun to bask ,</l>
     <l n="3">And from the mind of Cowper — call 'd “ The Task . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Of the Rev . Walter Bagot , who departed in the year 1806 ; aged seventy-five , the poet always spoke in the language of unfeigned esteem and affection .</p>
   <p>Sir George Throckmorton 's death has been already recorded , and with this event the genius of the place may be said to have deserted its hallowed retreats , for the mansion exists no longer . His surviving estimable widow the Catharina of Cowper , resides at Northampton .</p>
   <p>Lady Hesketh , whose affectionate kindness to the poet must have endeared her to every reader , died in the year 1807 , aged seventy-four .</p>
   <p>To the Editor 's brother-in-law , the Rev . Dr. Johnson , several testimonies have already been borne in the course of this work . He was cousin to the poet , by one remove , which was the reason why he was usually designated as Cowper 's kinsman , his mother having been the daughter of the Rev . Roger Donne , rector of Catfield , Norfolk , own brother to Cowper 's mother . His unremitting and watchful care over the poet , for several successive years , and during a period marked by a painful and protracted malady , his generous sacrifice of his time , and of every personal consideration , that he might administer to the peace and comfort of his afflicted friend — his affectionate sympathy , and uniform forgetfulness of self , in all the various relations of life — these virtues have justly claimed for Dr. Johnson the esteem and love of his friends , and the honourable distinction of being ever identified with the endeared name of Cowper . He was rector of the united parishes of Yaxham and Welborne , in the county of Norfolk , where he preached the doctrines of the gospel with fidelity , and adorned them by the Christian tenor of his life and conduct . He married Miss Livius , daughter of the late George Livius , Esq ., formerly at the head of the commissariat , in India , during the government of Warren Hastings . The Editor was connected with him by marrying the sister of Mrs. Johnson . He departed in the autumn of the year 1833 , after a short illness , and was followed to the grave by a crowded assemblage of his parishioners , to whom he was endeared by his virtues . He left his estimable widow and four surviving children to lament his loss . Cowper was engraved on his heart , and his Poems minutely impressed on his memory . Both , therefore , became a frequent theme of conversation ; and it is to these sources of information , that the writer is indebted for the knowledge of many facts and incidents that are incorporated in the present edition .</p>
   <p>The value which Cowper attached to the esteem of the Rev . W. Bull , the friend and travelling companion of John Thornton , Esq ., may be seen in the following letter . It alludes to the approbation expressed by Mr. Bull on the publication of his first volume of poems .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>TO THE REV . WILLIAM BULL .</head>
     <l n="1">March 24 , 1782 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Your letter gave me great pleasure , both as a testimony of your approbation and of your regard . I wrote in hopes of pleasing you , and such as you ; and though I must confess that , at the same time , I cast a sidelong glance at the good liking of the world at large , I believe I can say it was more for the sake of their advantage and instruction than their praise . They are children ; if we give them physic , we must sweeten the rim of the cup with honey — if my book is so far honoured as to be made the vehicle of true knowledge to any that are ignorant , I shall rejoice , and do already rejoice that it has procured me a proof of your esteem .</p>
   <p>Yours , most truly , W. C .</p>
   <p>Mr. Bull was distinguished by no common powers of mind , brilliant wit , and imagination . It was at his suggestion that Cowper engaged in translating the poems of Madame Guion . He died , as he lived , in the hopes and consolations of the Gospel , and left a son , the Rev . Thomas Bull , who inherits his father 's virtues .</p>
   <p>Wherever men have acquired celebrity by those powers of genius with which Providence has seen fit to discriminate them , a curiosity prevails to learn all the minuter traits of person , habit , and real character . We wish to realize the portrait before our eyes , to see how far all the component parts are in harmony with each other ; or whether the elevation of mind which raises them beyond the general standard is perceptible in the occurrences of common life . Tell me , said an inquirer , writing from America , what was the figure of Cowper , what the character of his countenance , the expression of his eye , his manner , his habits , the house he lived in , whether its aspect was north or south , &amp; c. This is amusing , but it shows the power of sympathy with which we are drawn to whatever commands our admiration , and excites the emotions of esteem and love .</p>
   <p>The person and mind of Cowper seem to have been formed with equal kindness by nature ; and it may be questioned if she ever bestowed on any man , with a fonder prodigality , all the requisites to conciliate affection and to inspire respect .</p>
   <p>He is said to have been handsome in his youth . His features strongly expressed the powers of his mind and all the sensibility of his heart ; and even in his declining years , time seemed to have spared much of its ravages , though his mind was harassed by unceasing nervous excitement .</p>
   <p>He was of a middle stature , rather strong than delicate in the form of his limbs ; the colour of his hair was a light brown , that of his eyes a bluish grey , and his complexion ruddy . In his dress he was neat , but not finical ; in his diet temperate , and not dainty .</p>
   <p>He had an air of pensive reserve in his deportment , and his extreme shyness sometimes produced in his manners an indescribable mixture of awkwardness and dignity ; but no person could be more truly graceful , when he was in perfect health , and perfectly pleased with his society . Towards women , in particular , his behaviour and conversation were delicate and fascinating in the highest degree .</p>
   <p>There was a simplicity of manner and character in Cowper which always charms , and is often the attribute of real genius . He was singularly calculated to excite emotions of esteem and love by those qualities that win confidence and inspire sympathy . In friendship he was uniformly faithful ; and , if the events of life had not disappointed his fondest hopes , no man would have been more eminently adapted for the endearments of domestic life .</p>
   <p>His daily habits of study and exercise are so minutely and agreeably delineated in his letters , that they present a perfect portrait of his domestic character .</p>
   <p>His voice conspired with his features to announce to all who saw and heard him the extreme sensibility of his heart ; and in reading aloud he furnished the chief delight of those social , enchanting , winter evenings , which he has described so happily in the fourth book of “ The Task . ”</p>
   <p>Secluded from the world , as he had long been , he yet retained in advanced life singular talents for conversation ; and his remarks were uniformly distinguished by mild and benevolent pleasantry , by a strain of delicate humour , varied by solid and serious good sense , and those united charms of a cultivated mind , which he has himself very happily described in drawing the character of a venerable friend :</p>

     <l n="2">Exact , yet not precise : though meek , keen-eyed ;</l>
     <l n="3">Who , when occasion justified its use ,</l>
     <l n="4">Had wit , as bright as ready , to produce ;</l>
     <l n="5">Could fetch from records of an earlier age ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or from philosophy 's enlightened page ,</l>
     <l n="7">His rich materials , and regale your ear</l>
     <l n="8">With strains , it was a privilege to hear .</l>
     <l n="9">Yet , above all , his luxury supreme ,</l>

     <l n="11">Ambitious not to shine or to excel ,</l>
     <l n="12">But to treat justly what he lov 'd so well .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But the traits of his character are nowhere developed with happier effect than in his own writings , and especially in his poems . From these we shall make a few extracts , and suffer him to draw the portrait for himself .</p>

   <p>The office of doing justice to the poetical genius of Cowper has been assigned to an individual so well qualified to execute it with taste and ability , that the Editor begs thus publicly to record his acknowledgements and his unmingled satisfaction . The bowers of the Muses are not unknown to the Rev . John Cunningham , and , in contemplating the poetical labours of others , he might , with a small variation , justly apply to himself the well-known exclamation , “ Ed anch'io son pittore .

   <p>We must not omit a most splendid specimen of Cowper 's poetic genius , entitled the “ Yardley Oak . ” It is an unfinished poem , and supposed to have been written in the year 1791 , and laid aside , without ever having been resumed , when his attention was engrossed with the edition of Milton . Whatever may be the history of this admirable fragment , it has justly acquired for Cowper the reputation of having produced one of the richest and most highly finished pieces of versification that ever flowed from the pen of a poet . Its existence even was unknown both to Dr. Johnson and Hayley , till the latter discovered it buried in a mass of papers . We subjoin in a note a letter addressed by Dr. Johnson to Hayley , containing further particulars .<span type="note_anchor">[ 781 ]</span></p>
   <note>781</note>
   <p>“ January 6 , 1804 .</p>
   <p>“ Among our dear Cowper 's papers , I found the following memorandum :</p>
   <p>YARDLEY OAK IN GIRTH , FEET 22 , INCHES 6½ . THE OAK AT YARDLEY LODGE , FEET 28 , INCHES 5 .</p>
   <p>As to Yardley Oak , it stands in Yardley Chase , where the Earls of Northampton have a fine seat . It was a favourite walk of our dear Cowper , and he once carried me to see that oak . I believe it is five miles at least from Weston Lodge . It is indeed a noble tree , perfectly sound , and stands in an open part of the Chase , with only one or two others near it , so as to be seen to advantage .</p>
   <p>“ With respect to the oak at Yardley Lodge , that is quite in decay — a pollard , and almost hollow . I took an excrescence from it in the year 1791 , and , if I mistake not , Cowper told me it is said to have been an oak in the time of the Conqueror . This latter oak is on the road to the former , but not above half so far from Weston Lodge , being only just beyond Killick and Dinglederry . This is all I can tell you about the oaks . They were old acquaintance and great favourites of the bard . How rejoiced I am to hear that he has immortalized one of them in blank verse ! Where could those one hundred and sixty-one lines lie hid ? Till this very day I never heard of their existence , nor suspected it . ”</p>
   <p>Though this fragment is inserted among the poems , we extract the following passages , as expressive of the vigour and inspiration of true poetic genius .</p>

   <p>With these acknowledged claims to popular favour , it is pleasing to reflect on the singular moderation of Cowper amidst the snares of literary fame . His motives seem to have been pure and simple , and his main design to elevate the character of the age , and to glorify God . He was not insensible to the value of applause , when conferred by a liberal and powerful mind , but even in this instance it was a subdued and chastened feeling . A more pleasing evidence could not be adduced than when Hayley , in one of his visits to Weston , brought a recent newspaper containing a speech of Mr. Fox , in which that distinguished orator had quoted the following impressive verses on the Bastille , in the House of Commons .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 784 ]</span>The late Lord Erskine was a frequent reciter of passages from Cowper 's poems . The Editor is indebted to E. H. Barker , Esq . of Thetford , for the following anecdote which was communicated to him by Joseph Jekyll , Esq ., the eminent counsellor .</p>
   <p>Mr. Jekyll was dining with Lord Oxford , and among the company were Dr. Parr , Horne Tooke , Lord Erskine , and Mr. W. Scott , ( brother to Lady Oxford . ) Lord Erskine recited , in his admirable manner , the verses of Cowper about the Captive , without saying whose they were : Dr. Parr expressed great admiration of the verses , and said that he had never heard of them or seen them before ; he inquired whose they were ? H. Tooke said , “ Why , Cowper 's . ” Dr. Parr said he had never read Cowper 's poems . “ Not read Cowper 's poems ! ” said Horne Tooke , “ and you never will , I suppose , Dr. Parr , till they are turned into Greek ? ” When the company went into the drawing-room , Lady Oxford presented Dr. Parr with a small edition of Cowper 's Poems , and Mr. Jekyll was desired by her ladyship to write in the book , “ From the Countess of Oxford to Dr. Parr . ” Horne Tooke wrote also underneath , “ Who never read the book , ” and signed his name to it : all present signed their names and added some remark , and among the rest W. Scott . At the sale of Dr. Parr 's books , this volume fetched about five pounds , being considered valuable and curious , as the W. Scott signed was supposed to have been Sir W. Scott ( since Lord Stowell . ) Lord Stowell afterwards took great pains to contradict the report .</p>
   <p>We have mentioned how little Cowper was elated by praise . We shall now state how much he was depressed by unjust censure . His first volume of poems had been severely criticised by the Analytical Review . His feelings are recorded in the following ( hitherto unpublished ) letter to John Thornton , Esq .</p>
   <p>Olney , May 21 , 1782 .</p>
   <p>Dear Sir ,— You have my sincere thanks for your obliging communication , both of my book to Dr. Franklin , and of his opinion of it to me . Some of the periodical critics , I understand have spoken of it with contempt enough ; but , while gentlemen of taste and candour have more favourable thoughts of it , I see reason to be less concerned than I have been about their judgment , hastily framed perhaps , and certainly not without prejudice against the subjects of which it treats .</p>
   <p>Your friendly intimation of the Doctor 's sentiments reached me very seasonably , just when , in a fit of despondence , to which no man is naturally more inclined , I had begun to regret the publication of it , and had consequently resolved to write no more . For if a man has the fortune to please none but his friends and their connexions , he has reason enough to conclude that he is indebted for the measure of success he meets with , not to the real value of his book , but to the partiality of the few that approve it . But I now feel myself differently affected towards my favourite employment ; for which sudden change in my sentiments I may thank you and your correspondent in France , his entire unacquaintedness with me , a man whom he never saw , nor will see , his character as a man of sense and condition , and his acknowledged merit as an ingenious and elegant writer , and especially his having arrived at an age when men are not to be pleased they know not why , are so many circumstances that give a value to his commendations , and make them the most flattering a poor poet could receive , quite out of conceit with himself , and quite out of heart with his occupations .</p>
   <p>If you think it worth your while , when you write next to the Doctor , to inform him how much he has encouraged me by his approbation , and to add my respects to him , you will oblige me still further ; for next to the pleasure it would afford me to hear that it has been useful to any , I cannot have a greater , so far as my volume is in question , than to hear that it has pleased the judicious .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Unwin desires me to add her respectful compliments .</p>
   <p>I am , dear sir , Your affectionate and most obedient servant , W. C .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">To John Thornton , Esq .</l>
     <l n="2">Clapham , Surrey .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Through this harsh and unwarrantable exercise of criticism , the world might never have possessed the immortal poem of “ The Task , ” if an American philosopher had not awarded that honourable meed of just praise and commendation , which an English critic thought proper to withhold .</p>
   <p>But it is not merely the poetic claims of Cowper which have earned for him so just a title to public gratitude and praise . It would be unjust not to bestow particular notice on a talent , in which he singularly excelled , and one that friendship ought especially to honour , as she is indebted to it for a considerable portion of her happiest sources of delight — we mean the talent of writing letters .</p>
   <p>Those of Pope are generally considered to be too laboured , and deficient in ease . Swift is frequently ill-natured and offensive . Gray is admirable , but not equal to Cowper either in the graces of simplicity , or in the warmth of affection .</p>
   <p>The letters of Cowper are not distinguished by any remarkable superiority of thought or diction ; it is rather the easy and graceful flow of sentiment and feeling , his enthusiastic love of nature , his touching representations of common and domestic life , and above all , the ingenuous disclosure of the recesses of his own heart , that constitute their charm and excellence . They form a kind of biographical sketch , drawn by his own hand . His poetry proclaims the author , his correspondence depicts the man . We see him in his walks , in the privacy of his study , in his daily occupations , amid the endearments of home , and with all the qualities that inspire friendship , and awaken confidence and love . We learn what he thought , what he said , his views of men and manners , his personal habits and history . His ideas usually flow without premeditation . All is natural and easy . There is no display , no evidence of conscious superiority , no concealment of his real sentiments . He writes as he feels and thinks , and with such an air of truth and frankness , that he seems to stamp upon the letter the image of his mind , with the same fidelity of resemblance that the canvass represents his external form and features . We see in them the sterling good sense of a man , the playfulness and simplicity of a child , and the winning softness and delicacy of a woman 's feelings . He can write upon any subject , or write without one . He can embellish what is real by the graces of his imagination , or invest what is imaginary with the semblance of reality . He can smile or he can weep , philosophize or trifle , descant with fervour on the loveliness of nature , talk about his tame hares , or cast the overflowings of an affectionate heart at the shrine of friendship . His correspondence is a wreath of many flowers . His letters will always be read with delight and interest , and by many , perhaps , will be considered to be the rivals of his poems . They are justly entitled to the eulogium which we know to have been pronounced upon them by Charles Fox ,— that of being “ the best specimens of epistolary excellence in the English language . ”</p>
   <p>Among men distinguished by classical taste and acquirements , his Latin poems will ever be considered as elegant specimens of composition , and formed after the best models of antiquity .</p>

   <p>We have thus endeavoured to exhibit the singular versatility of Cowper 's genius , and the combination of powers not often united in the same mind . All that now remains is to consider the consecration of these faculties to high and holy ends ; and the influence of his writings on the literary , the moral , and religious character of the age .</p>
   <p>The great end and aim which he proposed to himself as an author , has already been illustrated from his writings ; we add one more passage to show the sanctity of his character .</p>

   <p>It was from this source that Cowper drew the materials that have given to his writings the character of so elevated a morality . Too seldom , alas ! have poets consecrated their powers to the cause of divine truth . In modern times , especially , we have witnessed a voluptuous imagery and appeal to the passions , in some highly-gifted writers , which have contributed to undermine public morality , and to tarnish the purity of female minds . But it is the honourable distinction of Cowper 's poetry , that nothing is to be found to excite a blush on the cheek of modesty , nor a single line that requires to be blotted out . He has done much to introduce a purer and more exalted taste ; he is the poet of nature , the poet of the heart and conscience , and , what is a still higher praise , the poet of Christianity . He mingled the waters of Helicon with the hallowed streams of Siloam , and planted the cross amid the bowers of the muses . Johnson , indeed , has remarked , that religion is not susceptible of poetry .<span type="note_anchor">[ 786 ]</span>If this be true , it can arise only from the want of religious authors and religious readers . But we venture to deny the position , and to maintain that religion ennobles whatever it touches . In architecture , what building ever rivalled the magnificence of the temple of Jerusalem , St. Peter 's in Rome , or the imposing grandeur of St. Paul 's ? In painting , what power of art can surpass the Transfiguration of a Raphael , the Ecce Homo of a Guido , or the Elevation and Descent of the Cross in a Rubens ? In poetry , where shall we find a nobler production of human genius than the Paradise Lost ? Again , let us listen to the language of the pious Fénelon :</p>
   <p>“ No Greek or Latin poetry is comparable to the Psalms . That which begins , ‘ The God of gods , the Lord hath spoken , and hath called up the earth , ’ exceeds whatever human imagination has produced . Neither Homer , nor any other poet , equals Isaiah , in describing the majesty of God , in whose presence empires are as a grain of sand , and the whole universe as a tent , which to-day is set up , and removed to-morrow . Sometimes , as when he paints the charms of peace , Isaiah has the softness and sweetness of an eclogue ; at others , he soars above mortal conception . But what is there in profane antiquity comparable to the wailings of Jeremiah , when he mourns over the calamities of his people ? or to Nahum , when he foresees in spirit the downfall of Nineveh , under the assault of an innumerable army ? We almost behold the formidable host , and hear the arms and the chariots . Read Daniel , denouncing to Belshazzar the vengeance of God , ready to fall upon him ; compare it with the most sublime passages of pagan antiquity ; you find nothing comparable to it . It must be added that , in the Scriptures , every thing sustains itself ; whether we consider the historical , the legal , or the poetical part of it , the proper character appears in all . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 786 ]</span>The reasons which he assigns , in justification of this opinion , are thus specified .</p>
   <p>“ Let no pious ear be offended if I advance , in opposition to many authorities , that poetical devotion cannot often please . The doctrines of religion may indeed be defended in a didactic poem ; and he who has the happy power of arguing in verse will not lose it because his subject is sacred . A poet may describe the beauty and the grandeur of nature , the flowers of the spring , and the harvests of autumn , the vicissitudes of the tide , and the revolutions of the sky , and praise the Maker for his works , in lines which no reader shall lay aside . The subject of the disputation is not piety , but the motives to piety ; that of the description is not God , but the works of God .</p>
   <p>“ Contemplative piety , or the intercourse between God and the human soul , cannot be poetical . Man , admitted to implore the mercy of his Creator , and plead the merits of his Redeemer , is already in a higher state than poetry can confer .</p>
   <p>“ The essence of poetry is invention ; such invention as , by producing something unexpected , surprises and delights . The topics of devotion are few , and being few are universally known ; but , few as they are , they can be made no more ; they can receive no grace from novelty of sentiment , and very little from novelty of expression .</p>
   <p>“ Poetry pleases by exhibiting an idea more grateful to the mind than things themselves afford . This effect proceeds from the display of those parts of nature which attract , and the concealment of those which repel the imagination . But Religion must be shown as it is : suppression and addition equally corrupt it ; and such as it is , it is known already .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ From poetry the reader justly expects , and from good poetry</l>
     <l n="2">always obtains , the enlargement of his comprehension and</l>
     <l n="3">elevation of his fancy ; but this is rarely to be hoped by</l>
     <l n="4">Christians from metrical devotion . Whatever is great , desirable ,</l>
     <l n="5">or tremendous , is comprised in the name of the Supreme Being .</l>
     <l n="6">Omnipotence cannot be exalted ; Infinity cannot be amplified ;</l>
     <l n="7">Perfection cannot be improved .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ The employments of pious meditation are Faith , Thanksgiving , Repentance , and Supplication . Faith invariably uniform , cannot be invested by fancy with decorations . Thanksgiving , the most joyful of all holy effusions , yet addressed to a Being without passions , is confined to a few modes , and is to be felt , rather than expressed . Repentance , trembling in the presence of the Judge , is not at leisure for cadences and epithets . Supplication of man to man may diffuse itself through many topics of persuasion ; but supplication to God can only cry for mercy .</p>
   <p>“ Of sentiments purely religious it will be found that the most simple expression is the most sublime . Poetry loses its lustre and its power , because it is applied to the decoration of something more excellent than itself . All that pious verse can do is to help the memory and delight the ear , and for these purposes it may be very useful ; but it supplies nothing to the mind . The ideas of Christian theology are too simple for eloquence , too sacred for fiction , and too majestic for ornament ; to recommend them by tropes and figures , is to magnify by a concave mirror the sidereal hemisphere . ” — See Life of Waller .</p>
   <p>These remarks seem to be founded on very erroneous principles ; but having already offered our sentiments , we forbear any further comment , except to state that we profess to belong to the school of Cowper ; that we participate in the expression of his regret ,</p>
   <lg>

   <p>It would be singular , if a subject which unveils to the eye of faith the glories of the invisible world , and which is to be a theme of gratitude and praise throughout eternity , could inspire no ardour in a poet 's soul ; and if the wings of imagination could take flight to every world save to that which is eternal . We leave our Montgomeries to refute so gross an error , and appeal with confidence to the page of Cowper .</p>
   <p>We quote the following passage , to show that religion can not only supply the noblest theme , but also communicate a corresponding sublimity of thought and language . It is the glowing and poetical description of the millennial period , commencing with —</p>

   <p>By this devotional strain of poetry , so adapted to the spirit of the present age , Cowper is rapidly accomplishing a revolution in the public taste , and creating a new race of readers . He is purifying the literary atmosphere from its noxious vapours . The muse has too long taken her flight downwards ; Cowper leads her to hold communion with the skies . He has taught us that literary celebrity , acquired at the cost of public morals , is but an inglorious triumph , and merits no better title than that of splendid infamy . His page has fully proved that the varied field of nature , the scenes of domestic life , and the rich domain of moral and religious truth , are sufficiently ample for the exercise of poetic taste and fancy ; while they never fail to tranquillize the mind , to invigorate the principles , and to enlarge the bounds of virtuous pleasure .</p>
   <p>The writings of Cowper have also been highly beneficial to the church of England . If he has been a severe , he has also been a faithful monitor . We allude to such passages as the following —</p>

     <l n="2">The legate of the skies !— His theme divine ,</l>

     <l n="4">By him the violated law speaks out</l>
     <l n="5">Its thunders ; and by him , in strains as sweet</l>
     <l n="6">As angels use , the gospel whispers peace .</l>
     <l n="7">He ‘ stablishes the strong , restores the weak ,</l>
     <l n="8">Reclaims the wand'rer , binds the broken heart ,</l>
     <l n="9">And , arm 'd himself in panoply complete</l>
     <l n="10">Of heavenly temper , furnishes with arms</l>
     <l n="11">Bright as his own , and trains , by every rule</l>
     <l n="12">Of holy discipline , to glorious war ,</l>
     <l n="13">The sacramental host of God 's elect !</l>

   <p>These rebukes , pungent as they are , were needed . The works of Mrs. Hannah More bear unquestionable testimony to this fact . But we may now record with gratitude a very perceptible change , and appeal to the evidences of reviving piety among all classes of the clergy .</p>
   <p>Though the singular and mysterious malady of Cowper has been the occasion of repeated remark , yet we cannot dismiss the subject without a few concluding reflections .</p>
   <p>In contrasting with his other letters the correspondence with Newton , the chosen depositary of all his secret woe , it is difficult to recognise in the writer the same identity of character . His mind appears to have undergone some transforming process , and the gay and lively tints of his sportive imagination to be suddenly shrouded in the gloom of a mysterious and appalling darkness . We seem to enter into the regions of sorrow and despair , and to trace the terrific inscription so finely drawn by the poet , in his celebrated “ Inferno : ”</p>
   <p>“ Voi ch ’ entrate lasciate ogni speranza . "[ 787 ]</p>
   <p>Ye who enter here leave all hope behind .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 787 ]</span>See the “ Inferno ” of Dante , where this motto is inscribed over the entrance into the abodes of woe .</p>
   <p>In contemplating this afflicting dispensation , and referring every event , as we must , to the appointment or permissive providence of God , we feel constrained to exclaim with the patriarch , “ The thunder of his power who can understand ? "[ 788 ] But life , as Bishop Hall observes , is made up of perturbations ; and those seem most subject to their occurrence who are distinguished by the gifts of rank , fortune , or genius . Such is the discipline which the moral Governor of the world sees fit to employ for the purification of their possessors ! In recording the lot of genius , Milton , it is known , was blind , Pope was afflicted with sickness , and Tasso , Swift , Smart , and Collins , were exposed to the aberrations of reason . “ Moralists , ” says Dr. Johnson , “ talk of the uncertainty of fortune , and of the transitoriness of beauty ; but it is yet more dreadful to consider that the powers of the mind are equally liable to change — that understanding may make its appearance and depart , that it may blaze and expire . ” It seems as if the mind were too ethereal to be confined within the bounds of its earthly prison , or that the too frequent and intense exercise of thought disturbs the digestive organs , and lays the foundation of hypochondriacal feelings , which cloud the serenity of the soul . It is painful to reflect how much our sensations of comfort and happiness depend on the even flow and circulation of the blood . But the connexion of physical and moral causes has been the subject of philosophical remark in all ages . The somewhat analogous case of the celebrated Dr. Johnson seems to have been overlooked by preceding biographers of Cowper . “ The morbid melancholy , ” observes Boswell , “ which was lurking in his constitution , and to which we may ascribe those peculiarities , and that aversion to regular life , which , at a very early period , marked his character , gathered such strength in his twentieth year , as to afflict him in a dreadful manner . While he was at Lichfield , in the college vacation , in 1729 , he felt himself overwhelmed with a horrible hypochondria , with perpetual irritation , fretfulness , and impatience ; and with a dejection , gloom , and despair , which made existence misery . From this dismal malady he never afterwards was perfectly relieved ; and all his labours , and all his enjoyments , were but temporary interruptions of its baleful influence . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 788 ]</span>Job xxvi . 14 .</p>
   <p>Let those to whom Providence has assigned a humbler path , learn the duty of contentment , and be thankful that if they are denied the honours attendant on rank and genius , they are at least exempted from its trials . For where there are heights , there are depths ; and he who occupies the summit is often seen descending into the valley of humiliation .</p>
   <p>That a similar morbid temperament may be traced in the case of Cowper is indisputable ; nor can a more conclusive evidence be adduced than the words of his own memoir :— “ I was struck , not long after my settlement in the Temple , with such a dejection of spirits , as none but they who have felt the same can have the least conception of . Day and night I was upon the rack , lying down in horror , and rising up in despair . "[ 789 ] In his subsequent attack , religion became an adjunct , not a cause , for he describes himself at that period as having lived without religion . The impression under which he laboured was therefore manifestly not suggested by a theological creed , but was the delusion of a distempered fancy . Every other view is founded on misconception , and must inevitably tend to mislead the public .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 789 ]</span>See page 451 .</p>
   <p>Before we conclude the Life of Cowper , there are some important reflections , arising from his unhappy malady , which we beg to impress on the attention of the reader .</p>
   <p>The fruitful source of all his misery was the indulgence of an over-excited state of feeling . His mind was never quiescent . Occurrences , which an ordinary degree of self-possession would have met with calmness , or passive indifference , were to him the subject of mental agony and distress . His imagination gave magnitude to trifles , till what was at first ideal , at length assumed the character of a terrible reality . He was always anticipating evil ; and so powerful is the influence of fancy that what we dread we seldom fail to realize . Thus Swift lived in the constant fear of mental imbecility , and at length incurred the calamity . We scarcely know a spectacle more pitiable , and yet more reprehensible . For what is the use of reason , if we reject its dictates ? or the promise of the Spirit to help our infirmities , if we nevertheless yield to their sway ? How important in the education of youth to repress the first symptoms of nervous irritability , to invigorate the principles , and to train the mind to habits of self-discipline , and firm reliance upon God ! The far greater proportion of human trials originate not in the appointment of Providence , but may be traced to the want of a well-ordered and duly regulated mind ; to the ascendency of passion , and to the absence of mental and moral energy . It is possible to indulge in a state of mind that shall rob every blessing of half its enjoyment , and give to every trial a double portion of bitterness .</p>
   <p>We turn with delight to a more edifying feature in his character —</p>
   <p>His submission under this dark dispensation .</p>
   <p>It is easy to exhibit the triumphs of faith in moments of exultation and joy ; but the vivid energy of true faith is never more powerfully exemplified , than when it is left to its own naked exercise , unaided by the influence of exciting causes . It is amid the desolation of hope , and when the iron enters into the soul — it is amid pain , depression , and sorrow , when the eye is suffused with tears , and every nerve vibrates with emotion — to be able to exclaim at such a moment , “ Here I am , let him do with me as seemeth him good ;"[ 790 ] this is indeed the faith which is of the operation of the Spirit , which none but God can give , and which will finally lead to a triumphant crown .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 790 ]</span>Letter to Newton , May 20 , 1786 .</p>
   <p>That the mind should still indulge its sorrows , in moments of awakened feeling , is natural . On this subject we know nothing more touching than the manner in which Cowper parodies and appropriates to himself Milton 's affecting lamentation over his own blindness :[ 791 ]</p>

   <p>The severest trials are not without their alleviation , nor the accompaniment of some gracious purpose . Had it not been for Cowper 's visitation , the world might never have been presented with The Task , nor the Church of Christ been edified with the Olney Hymns . He was constrained to write , in order to divert his melancholy . “ Despair , ” he observes , “ made amusement necessary , and I found poetry the most agreeable amusement . "[ 793 ] “ In such a situation of mind , encompassed by the midnight of absolute despair , and a thousand times filled with unspeakable horror , I first commenced an author . Distress drove me to it ; and the impossibility of subsisting without some employment , still recommends it . "[ 794 ] How wonderful are the ways of God , and what a powerful commentary on Cowper 's own celebrated hymn —</p>
   <p>God moves in a mysterious way , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>It will probably be found , at the last great day , that the darkest dispensations were the most essential links in the chain of providential dealings ; and that what we least understood , and often contemplated with solemn awe on earth , will form the subject of never-ceasing praise in eternity .</p>

   <p>Whatever were the trials of Cowper , they are now terminated .</p>
   <p>It will be remembered that his kinsman saw , or thought he saw , in the features of his deceased friend , “ an expression of calmness and composure , mingled , as it were , with holy surprise . "[ 795 ] We would not attach too much importance to a look , but rather rest our hopes of Cowper 's happiness on the covenanted mercy and faithfulness of God . Still the supposition is natural and soothing ; and we by no means think it improbable that the disembodied spirit might communicate to the earthly lineaments , in the moment of departure , the impression of its own heavenly joy . And O ! what must have been the expression of that surprise and joy , when , as his immortal spirit ascended to him that gave it , instead of beholding the averted eye of an offended God , he recognised the radiant smiles of his reconciled countenance , and the caresses of his tenderness and love — when all heaven burst upon his astonished view ; and when , amid angels , and archangels , and the spirits of just men made perfect , he was invited to bear his part in the glorious song of the redeemed , Thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory , and honour , and power ; for thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood , and hast made us unto our God kings and priests for ever and ever .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 795 ]</span>See page 448 .</p>
   <p>But it is time to close our remarks on the Life and Writings of Cowper . It is a name that has long entwined itself around the affections of our heart , and appealed , from early days , both to conscience and feeling . We lament our inadequacy to fulfil all the duties of the present important undertaking , but the motives which have powerfully urged us to engage in it , are founded on a wish to exhibit Cowper in accordance with his own Christian character and principles ; to vindicate him from prevailing misconceptions ; and in imputing the gloom of depression , under which he laboured , to its true causes , so to treat this delicate subject as to make it the occasion of sympathizing interest , and not of revolting and agonized feelings . The private correspondence , in this respect , is invaluable , and absolutely essential to the clear elucidation of his case . Other documents have also been inserted that never appeared in any previous biography of Cowper ; and private sources of information have been explored , not easily accessible to other inquirers . We trust this object has been attained , and the hope of so important a result is a source of cheering consolation . The history of Cowper is fruitful in the pathetic , the sublime , and the terrible , so as to produce an effect that seems almost to realize the fictions of romance . A life composed of such materials cannot fail to command attention . It possesses all the bolder lineaments of character , relieved by the familiar , the tender , the sportive , and the gay . Emotions are thus excited in which the heart loves to indulge ; for who does not delight alternately in the calmness of repose , and in the excitement of awakened feeling ?</p>
   <p>But , independently of the interest created by the events of Cowper 's life , there is something singularly impressive in the mechanism of his mind . It is so curiously wrought , and wonderfully made , as to form a subject for contemplation to the philosopher , the Christian , and the medical observer . The union of these several qualifications seems necessary to analyze the interior springs of thought and action , to mark the character of God 's providential dealings , and to trace the influence of morbid temperament on the powers of the intellect and the passions of the soul . His mind presents the most wonderful combinations of the grave and the gay , the social and the retired , ministering to the spiritual joy of others , yet enveloped in the gloom of darkness , enchained with fetters , yet vigorous and free , soaring to the heights of Zion , yet precipitated to the depths below . It resembles a beautiful landscape , overshadowed by a dark and impending cloud . Every moment we expect the cloud to burst on the head of the devoted sufferer ; and the awful anticipation would be fulfilled , were it not that a divine hand , which guides every event , and without which not even a sparrow falls to the ground , interposes and arrests the shock . Upwards of twenty years expired , during which he was thus graciously upheld . He then began to sink under his accumulated sorrows . But it is worthy of observation , that during this period his mind never suffered a total alienation . It was a partial eclipse , not night , nor yet day . He lived long enough , both for himself and others , sufficient to discharge all the claims of an affectionate friendship , and to raise to himself an imperishable name on the noble foundation of moral virtue . At length , when he stood alone , as it were , like a column in the melancholy waste ; when he was his own world , and the solitary agent , around which clung the sensations of a heart always full , and the reflections of a mind unconscious of a pause — he died . But his last days and moments were soothed by the offices of Christian kindness , and the most disinterested regard . His beloved kinsman never left him till he had closed his eyes in death , and till the disembodied spirit , at length , found the rest in heaven , which for ever obliterated all its earthly sorrows .</p>
   <p>And there shall be no more curse , but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him . And they shall see his face ; and his name shall be in their foreheads . And there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light ; and they shall reign for ever and ever .— Rev . xxii . 3-5 .</p>

    <head>ON THE GENIUS AND POETRY OF COWPER .</head>
    <head>BY THE REV . J. W. CUNNINGHAM , A. M ., VICAR OF HARROW .</head>
    <head>In presenting to the public the first Complete Edition of the Works of Cowper , it is thought desirable to prefix to the Poems a short dissertation on his Genius and Poetry . It is true that criticisms abound which have nearly the same object . It is true also that some of these criticisms are of a very high order of excellence . But perhaps their very number and merit supply a reason for adding at least one to the catalogue . The observations of the different Reviewers are scattered over so large a number of volumes , and these volumes are many of them , either of so expensive or so ephemeral a character , that an essay which endeavours to collect these criticisms into a focus , and present them at once to the eye of the reader , is far from superfluous . And the present critique pretends to little more than the accomplishment of this object . The writer is not ashamed to profit from the labour and genius of his predecessors in the same course , and to let them say for him , what he could not say so well for himself .</head>
     <l n="1">With this apology for what might otherwise be deemed a work of</l>
     <l n="2">supererogation , we enter upon the proposed undertaking .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And here we must begin by observing that it is impossible not to be struck with certain peculiarities in the history of Cowper , as connected with his poetical productions . Although , as it has been truly said of him — “ born a poet , if ever there was one , ” — thinking and feeling upon all occasions as none but a poet could , expressing himself in verse with almost incredible facility , it does not appear that Cowper , between the ages of fourteen and thirty-three , produced anything beyond the most trifling specimens of his art . The only lines characteristic of his genius and peculiarities as a poet , and which , though composed at a distance of more than thirty years from the publication of “ The Task , ” have so intimate a resemblance to it as to seem to be a page out of the same volume , are those written at the age of eighteen , on finding the heel of an old shoe .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ This ponderous heel of perforated hide ,</l>
     <l n="2">Compact , with pegs indented , many a row ,</l>
     <l n="3">Haply ( for such its massy form bespeaks )</l>
     <l n="4">The weighty tread of some rude peasant clown</l>
     <l n="5">Upbore : on this supported , oft he stretched ,</l>
     <l n="6">With uncouth strides , along the furrow 'd glebe ,</l>
     <l n="7">Flattening the stubborn clod ; till cruel time ,</l>
     <l n="8">( What will not cruel time ? ) or a wry step ,</l>
     <l n="9">Sever 'd the strict cohesion ; when , alas !</l>
     <l n="10">He who could erst , with even , equal pace ,</l>
     <l n="11">Pursue his destin 'd way , with symmetry ,</l>
     <l n="12">And some proportion form 'd , now , on one side ,</l>
     <l n="13">Curtail 'd and maim 'd , the sport of vagrant boys ,</l>
     <l n="14">Cursing his frail supporter , treach'rous prop !</l>
     <l n="15">With toilsome steps , and difficult , moves on . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A few light and agreeable poems , two hymns written at Huntingdon , with about sixty others composed at Olney , are almost the only known poetical productions of his pen between the years 1749 and 1782 , at which last period he committed his volume of poems in rhyme to the press . There are examples in the physical world , of mountains reposing in coldness and quietness for ages ; and , at length , without any apparently new stimulus , awaking from their slumber , and deluging the surrounding vineyards with streams of fire . But it is , we believe , an unheard-of poetical phenomenon , for a mind teeming with such tendencies and capabilities as that of Cowper , to sleep through so long a period , and , at length , suddenly to awake , when illness and age might seem to have laid their palsying hand upon its energies , and at once to erect itself into poetical life and supremacy . In general , the poet either ‘ lisps in numbers , ’ or begins to put forth his hidden powers under the exciting influence of some new passion or emotion — such as love , fear , hope , or disappointment . But , how wide of this was the history of Cowper ! In his case , the muse had no infancy , but sprang full armed from the brain of the poet .</p>
   <p>But , if the tardy development of the poetical powers of our author was one peculiarity in his case , the suddenness and completeness of the development , when it did take place , was , under his circumstances , a still greater subject of surprise . In the account of his life we learn , that , after quitting Westminster school , at the age of eighteen , he spent three years in a solicitor 's office ; and passed from thence , at the age of twenty-one , into chambers in the Inner Temple . Soon after this event , he says of himself , “ I was struck , not long after my settlement in the Temple , with such a dejection of spirits , as none but they who have felt the same can have the least conception of . Day and night I was upon the rack , lying down in horror , rising up in despair . I presently lost all relish for the studies to which before I had been closely attached . The classics had no longer any charm for me . I had need of something more salutary than amusement , but I had no one to direct me where to find it . ” This dejection of mind , as our readers are aware , led him onward from depth to depth of misery and despair , till at length he was borne away , helpless and hopeless , in the year 1768 , to an asylum for insane patients at St. Albans . Released from the awful grasp of a perverted imagination , chiefly by the power of that religion , which , in spite of every fact in his history , has been , with malignant hatred to Christianity , charged as the cause of his madness , he spent the two happiest years of his life at Huntingdon . After this , he retired with the Unwin family to Olney , in Buckinghamshire ; and there , after passing through the most tremendous mental conflicts , sank again into a state of despondency ; from which he at length awoke , ( if it might be called awaking ,) not indeed to be freed from his delusions , but , whilst under their dominion , to delight , instruct , and astonish mankind , with some of the most original and enchanting poems in any language . The philosophical work of Browne , dedicated to Queen Caroline , and composed , as the author says , by a man who had lost his “ rational soul , ” has been always reputed the miracle of literature . But Browne 's case is scarcely more remarkable than that of Cowper . That a work sparkling with the most childlike gaiety and brilliant wit ; exhibiting the most cheerful views of the character of God , the face of nature , and the circumstances of man , should proceed from a writer who at the time regarded God as an implacable enemy ; the earth we live on , as the mere porch to a world of punishment ; and human life , at least in his own case , as the cloudy morning of a day of interminable anguish — all this is to be explained only by the fact that madness disdains all rules , and reconciles all contrarieties . His history supplies an example , not without its parallel , of a mind — like some weapon drawn from its sheath to fight a particular battle , and then suspended on the walls again — called forth to accomplish an important end , and then sent back again into obscurity . And it is no less an evidence , amongst a thousand other instances , that our heavenly Father “ in judgment remembers mercy , ” and bestows this mitigation of the heaviest of all maladies , that those exposed to its deadliest influence and themselves denied all access to the bright sources of happiness , are sometimes privileged to pour the streams of consolation over the path of others . How truly may it be said of such persons , “ Sic vos , non vobis , mellificatis apes . ”</p>
   <p>But whilst we speak of certain peculiarities in the case of Cowper , as calculated to destroy all reasonable expectation of such poems as he has given to the public , we are not sure that these very peculiarities have not assisted to supply his poetry with some of its characteristic and most valuable features . Among the qualities , for example , by which his compositions are distinguished , are those of strong sense — moderation on all the subjects most apt to throw the mind off its balance — maturity in thought , reasoning and imagination — fulness without inflation — the “ strength of the oak without its nodosities ” — the “ inspiration of the Sybil without her contortions ” — the most profound and extensive views of human nature . But perhaps every one of these qualities is oftener the growth of age than of youth ; and is rather the tardy fruit of patient experience than the sudden shoot of untrained and undisciplined genius .</p>
   <p>In like manner , the poetry of Cowper is characterised by the most touching tenderness , by the deepest sympathy with the sufferings of others , by a penetrating insight into the dark recesses of a tempted and troubled heart . But where are qualities such as these so likely to be cultivated as in the shady places of a suffering mind , and in the school of that stern mistress who teaches us “ from our own , to melt at others ’ woe , ” and to administer to others the medicines which have healed ourselves ? A celebrated physician is said to have inoculated himself with the virus of the plague , in order to practise with more efficacy in the case of others . Such voluntary initiation in sorrow was needless in the case of Cowper ;— another hand had opened the wound which was to familiarize him with the deepest trials of suffering humanity .</p>
   <p>It is time , however , that we should proceed to consider some of the claims of Cowper to the character of a poet . Large multitudes have found an almost irresistible charm in his writings . In what peculiarities does this powerful influence mainly reside ?</p>
   <p>In order to reply to this question , we would first direct the attention of our readers to the constitution of his mind .</p>
   <p>And here we may enter on our work by observing , that almost all critics have regarded an ardent love of nature as a sine quâ non in the constitution of a poet . And nature , surely , never had a more enthusiastic admirer than the author of the Task . How feelingly does he write on this subject !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I have loved the rural walk through lanes</l>
     <l n="2">Of grassy swarth , close cropp 'd by nibbling sheep ,</l>
     <l n="3">And skirted thick with intertexture firm</l>
     <l n="4">Of thorny bows ; have loved the rural walk</l>
     <l n="5">O'er hills , through valleys , and by river 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="6">E'er since , a truant boy , I pass 'd my bounds ,</l>
     <l n="7">T ’ enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>When Homer describes his shepherd as contemplating the heavens and earth by the light of the moon and stars , and says , with his accustomed simplicity and grace ,— “ The heart of the shepherd is glad ; ” our author might seem to have sat for the portrait . Although unacquainted with nature in her sublimest aspect , every point in creation appears to have a charm for him . To no lips would the strain of another poet be more appropriate .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I care not , fortune , what you me deny ;</l>
     <l n="2">You cannot rob me of free nature 's grace ;</l>
     <l n="3">You cannot shut the windows of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="4">Through which Aurora shows her brightening face ;</l>
     <l n="5">You cannot bar my constant feet to trace</l>
     <l n="6">The woods and lawns by living stream at eve . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is true , that every enthusiastic lover of nature is not a poet : but a man can scarcely rise to the dignity of that high office who has not a touch of this enthusiasm . Poetry is essentially an imitative art ; and he who is no lover of nature loses all the finest subjects of imitation . On the contrary , this attachment , especially if it be of an ardent character , supplies subjects to the muse every where . Winter or summer , the wilderness and the garden , the cedar of Libanus , and the hyssop on the wall ; all that is dull and ineloquent to another has a voice for him , and rouses him to think , to feel , to admire , and to speak . The following lines are said to have been introduced into “ The Task , ” to gratify Mrs. Unwin , after the first draught of the poem was finished . But what language can exhibit a more genuine attachment to nature ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ And witness , dear companion of my walks ,</l>
     <l n="2">Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive</l>
     <l n="3">Fast lock 'd in mine ....</l>
     <l n="4">Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long .</l>
     <l n="5">Thou know'st my praise of nature most sincere ,</l>
     <l n="6">And that my raptures are not conjur 'd up</l>
     <l n="7">To serve occasion of poetic pomp ,</l>
     <l n="8">But genuine ; and art partner of them all . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Nor was the delight which he derived from nature confined , in the case of our poet , to one sense . “ All the sounds , ” he writes , “ that nature utters are delightful , at least in this country . I should not perhaps find the roarings of lions in Africa , or of bears in Russia , very pleasing ; but I know of no beast in England , whose voice I do not account musical , save and except only the braying of an ass . The notes of all our birds and fowls please me , without one exception . I should not indeed think of keeping a goose in a cage , that I might hang him up in the parlour for the sake of his melody , but the goose upon a common , or in a farm-yard , is no bad performer . Seriously , however , it strikes me as a very observable instance of providential kindness to man , that such an exact accord has been contrived between his ear and the sounds with which , at least in a rural situation , it is almost every moment visited . The fields , the woods , the gardens , have each their concerts ; and the ear of man is for ever regaled by creatures who seem only to please themselves . Even the ears that are deaf to the Gospel are continually entertained , though without knowing it , by sounds for which they are solely indebted to its Author . "[ 796 ]</p>

   <p>Another poetical quality in the mind of Cowper is his ardent love of his species — a love which led him to contemplate , with the most solicitous regard , their wants , tastes , passions ; their diseases , and the appropriate remedies for them . It has been justly observed , that , if there are some who have little taste for the poetry which delineates only inanimate beings or objects , there is hardly any one who does not listen , with sympathy and delight , to that which exhibits the fortunes and feelings of man . The truth is , we suppose , that this last order of topics is most easily brought home to our own business and bosoms . Aristotle considers that the imitation or delineation of human action is one of the main objects of poetry . But if this be true , if the “ proper study of mankind is man , ” and one of the highest offices of poetry be to exhibit , as upon the stage , the fortunes and passions of his fellow beings — few have attained such eminence in his art as Cowper . His hymns are the close transcripts of his own soul . His rhymed poems have more of a didactic character ; but they are for the most part exhibitions of man in all his attitudes of thought and action . They are mirrors in which every man may contemplate his own mind . In the “ Task , ” he passes every moment from the contemplation of nature to that of the being who inhabits this fair , though fallen , world . He lashes the vices , laughs at the follies , mourns over the guilt of his species ; he spares no pains to conduct the guilty to the feet of their only true Friend , and to land the miserable amidst the green pastures and still waters of heavenly consolation .</p>
   <p>Another property in the mind of Cowper , which has given birth to some of the noblest passages in his poems , is his intense love of freedom . The political state of this country was scarcely ever more degraded than at the period when he began to write ; and every real patriot who could wield the pen , or lift the voice in the cause of legitimate and regulated freedom , had plenty to do at home . At the same period also the profligacy and tyranny of the privileged orders in France , and other of the old European dynasties , were such as to provoke the indignation of every lover of liberty . And lastly , at this time , that horrible traffic in human flesh , that capital crime , disgrace , and curse of the human species , the Slave Trade , prevailed in all its horrors . How splendid are many of the passages scattered so prodigally through his poems , in which the author rebukes the crimes of despotism and cruelty at home or abroad , and claims for mankind the high privileges with which God , by an everlasting charter , had endowed them .</p>
   <p>What lines can breathe a deeper indignation , than those quoted with such admiration by Mr. Fox , in the House of Commons , on the Bastile ?</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Ye horrid towers , th ’ abode of broken hearts ,</l>
     <l n="2">Ye dungeons and ye cages of despair ,</l>
     <l n="3">That monarchs have supplied , from age to age ,</l>
     <l n="4">With music such as suits their sovereign ears ,</l>
     <l n="5">The sighs and groans of miserable men :</l>
     <l n="6">There 's not an English heart that would not leap</l>
     <l n="7">To hear that ye were fallen at last . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And what passage in any uninspired writer is more noble and heart-stirring , than that on the decision in the case tried by the illustrious Granville Sharpe , to establish the liberty of all who touched the soil of England — a passage confessedly the foundation of the noblest effort of Curran , in his great speech on the liberty of the subject !</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ I would not have a slave to till my ground ,</l>
     <l n="2">To carry me , to fan me while I sleep ,</l>
     <l n="3">And tremble when I wake , for all the wealth</l>
     <l n="4">That sinews bought and sold have ever earn 'd .</l>
     <l n="5">No : dear as freedom is , and in my heart 's</l>
     <l n="6">Just estimation priz 'd above all price ,</l>
     <l n="7">I had much rather be myself the slave ,</l>
     <l n="8">And wear the bonds , than fasten them on him .</l>
     <l n="9">We have no slaves at home — then why abroad ?</l>
     <l n="10">And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave</l>
     <l n="11">That parts us , are emancipate and loos 'd .</l>
     <l n="12">Slaves cannot breathe in England ; if their lungs</l>
     <l n="13">Receive our air , that moment they are free ;</l>
     <l n="14">They touch our country , and their shackles fall .</l>
     <l n="15">That 's noble , and bespeaks a nation proud</l>
     <l n="16">And jealous of the blessing . Spread it then ,</l>
     <l n="17">And let it circulate through ev'ry vein</l>
     <l n="18">Of all your empire ; that , where Britain 's pow'r</l>
     <l n="19">Is felt , mankind may feel her mercy too . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But after all , perhaps , the peculiarity in the mind of Cowper , which gives the chief charm to his poetry , is the depth and ardour of his piety .</p>
   <p>It is impossible not to be aware of the severance which critics have laboured to effect between religion and poetry ,— between the character of the prophet and the poet : and that Johnson 's decision is thought by some to be final on the subject . Cowper himself admits that the connexion has been rare between the two characters — as witness the following lines —</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Pity religion has so seldom found</l>
     <l n="2">A skilful guide into poetic ground !</l>

     <l n="6">And many a compliment politely penn 'd ;</l>
     <l n="7">But , unattir 'd in that becoming vest</l>
     <l n="8">Religion weaves for her , and half undrest ,</l>
     <l n="9">Stands in the desert , shiv'ring and forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="10">A wintry figure like a wither 'd thorn . ”</l>

     <l n="13">Touch 'd with a coal from heaven , assume the lyre ,</l>
     <l n="14">And tell the world , still kindling as he sung ,</l>
     <l n="15">With more than mortal music on his tongue ,</l>
     <l n="16">That He who died below , and reigns above ,</l>
     <l n="17">Inspires the song , and that his name is ‘ Love . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Indeed no theory can have less foundation either in philosophy or in fact , than that poetry and religion have too little in common , for either to gain by an attempt to unite them . They seem to us born for each other . And , so important is this topic , that , although at the risk of repeating what has been said elsewhere , it may be well for a moment , to dwell upon it .</p>
   <p>The theory which endeavours to secure a perpetual divorce between religion and poetry has not the authority of the great critics of antiquity . Longinus maintains , in one place , that “ he who aims at the reputation of a sublime writer must spare no labour to educate his soul to grandeur , and to impregnate it with great and generous ideas . ” And he affirms , in another , that “ the faculties of the soul will grow stupid , the spirit be lost , and good sense and genius lie in ruins , when the care and study of man is engaged about the mortal and worthless part of himself , and he has ceased to cultivate virtue , and polish up the nobler part , his soul . ” Quintilian has a whole chapter to prove that a great writer must be a good man . And the greatest modern critics hold the same language . But , perhaps , in no passage is the truth upon this subject more nobly expressed , and a difficulty connected with it more ably explained , than in the following verses of a poem now difficult of access :</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ But , of our souls , the high-born loftier part ,</l>

     <l n="4">Creative fancy 's wild magnificence ;</l>

     <l n="6">— These , Virtue , these to thee alone belong .</l>

     <l n="8">And brightest burns , when lighted at the skies ;</l>
     <l n="9">Like vestal lamps , to purest bosoms giv'n ,</l>
     <l n="10">And kindled only by a ray from heav'n . "[ 797 ]</l>

   <p>Nor does this sentiment stand on the mere authority of critics ; but appears to be founded on just views of the constitution of our nature . Lighter themes can be expected to awaken only light and transient feelings in the bosom . The profounder topics of religion sink deeper ; touch all the hidden springs of thought and action ; and awaken emotions , which have all the force and permanence of the great principles and interests in which they originate .</p>
   <p>To us , no assertion would seem to have less warrant , than that taste suffers by its alliance with religion . The proper objects of taste are beauty and sublimity ; and if ( as a modern critic seems to us to have incontrovertibly established ) beauty and sublimity do not reside in the mere forms and colours of the objects we contemplate , but in the associations which they suggest to the mind , it cannot be questioned that the associations suggested to a man of piety , exceed both in beauty and sublimity those of every other class . God , as a Father , is the most lovely of all objects — God , as an avenger , is the most terrible ; and it is to the religious man exclusively , that this at once most tender and most terrible Being is disclosed , in all the beauty and majesty of holiness , by every object which he contemplates —</p>

   <p>It is striking to what an extent the greatest poets of all ages and countries have called in religion , under some form or other , to their assistance . How are the Iliad and Odyssey ennobled by their mythological machinery ; by the scales of Fate , the frown of Jove , and the intercession of Minerva ! How anxiously does Virgil labour to give a moral and religious character to his Georgics and Æneid ! And how nobly do these kindred spirits , by a bold fiction bordering upon truth , display the eternal mansions of joy and of misery , of reward and of punishment ; thus disclosing , not by the light of revelation , but by the blended flashes of genius and tradition , the strongest incentives to virtue , and the most terrific penalties of crime .</p>
   <p>The same may be affirmed of many of our own most distinguished poets ; of “ the sage and serious Spenser , ” and the immortal author of “ the Paradise Lost ” himself . Nor can we hesitate to trace the deep interest continually excited by the poetry of Cowper , in great measure , to the same source . Though often careless in the structure of his verse ; though sometimes lame , and lengthy , and prosaic in his manner ; though frequently employed about unpopular topics ; he is perhaps the most popular , with the exception of one , of all the English poets : and we believe that the main source of his general acceptance is the fact that he never fails to introduce the Creator into the scenes of his own universe ; that , by the soarings of his own mind , he lifts us from earth to heaven , and “ makes us familiar with a world unseen ; ” that he draws largely from the mine of Scripture , and thus exhibits the majesty and love of the Divine Being , in words and imagery which the great object of his wonder and love Himself provides .</p>
   <p>It is wholly needless for us to refer to any particular parts of the works of our author , as illustrative of his deep and sanguine spirit of piety . That spirit breathes through every line , and letter . It is , if we may so speak , the animating soul of his verses . The mind of the Christian reader is refreshed , in every step of his progress , by the conviction that the songs thus sung on earth were taught from Heaven ; and that , in resigning himself to the sweetest associate for this world , he is choosing the very best guide to another . Indeed , few have been disposed to deny to Cowper the highest of all poetical titles — that of The Poet of Christianity . In this field he has but one rival , the author of the “ Paradise Lost . ” And happily the provinces which they have chosen for themselves within the sacred enclosure are , for the most part , so distinct , that it is scarcely necessary to bring them into comparison . The distinguishing qualities of Milton are a surpassing elevation of thought and energy of expression , which leave the mind scarcely able to breathe under the pressure of his majesty , courage , and sublimity . The main defect of his poetry , as has been justly stated by an anonymous critic , is “ the absence of a charm neither to be named nor defined , which would render the whole as lovely as it is beautiful , and as captivating as it is sublime . ” “ His poetry , ” it is added by the same critic , “ will be ever praised by the many , and read by the few . The weakest capacity may be offended by its faults , but it requires a genius equal to his own to comprehend and enjoy all his merits .</p>
   <p>“ Cowper rarely equals Milton in sublimity , to which his subjects but seldom led ; he excels him in easy expression , delicate pleasantry , and generous satire ; and he resembles him in the temperate use of all his transcendent abilities . He never crushes his subject by falling upon it , nor permits his subject to crush him by falling beneath it . Invested with a sovereign command of diction , and enjoying unlimited freedom of thought , he is never prodigal of words , and he never riots amidst the exuberance of his conceptions ; his economy displays his wealth , and his moderation is the proof of his power ; his richest phrases seem the most obvious expression of his ideas , and his mightiest exertions are made apparently without toil . This , as we have already observed , is one of the grandest characteristics of Milton . It would be difficult to name a third poet of our country who could claim a similar distinction . Others , like Cowley , overwhelm their theme with their eloquence , or , like Young , sink exhausted beneath it , by aiming at magnificent , but unattainable , compression ; a third class , like Pope , whenever they write well , write their best , and never win but at full speed , and with all their might ; while a fourth , like Dryden and Churchill , are confident of their strength , yet so careless of their strokes , that when they conquer , it seems a matter of course , and when they fall , a matter of no consequence , for they can rise again as soon as they please . Milton and Cowper alone appear always to walk within the limits of their genius , yet up to the height of their great argument . We are not pretending to exalt them above all other British poets ; we have only compared them together on one point , wherein they accord with each other , and differ from the rest . But there is one feature of resemblance between them of a nobler kind . These good and faithful servants , who had received ten talents each , neither buried them in the earth , nor expended them for their own glory , nor lavished them in profligacy , but occupied them for their Master 's service ; and we trust have both entered into his joy . Their unfading labours , ( not subject to change , from being formed according to the fashion of this world , but being of equal and eternal interest to man in all ages ,) have disproved the idle and impious position which vain philosophy , hating all godliness , has endeavoured to establish ,— that religion can neither be adorned by poetry , nor poetry ennobled by religion . "[ 798 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 798 ]</span>Eclectic Review . This criticism it has been ascertained is from the pen of Mr. James Montgomery ; and the desire inseparably to connect what is so just and able with the works of Cowper has been the inducement , notwithstanding its length , to introduce it here .</p>
   <p>Having thus noticed some of those grand peculiarities in the mind of Cowper , which appear to have mainly contributed to place him among the highest order of poets , we proceed to point out some subordinate qualifications , without which , those already referred to would have failed to raise him to his present elevation . Even the buoyant spirit of a poet has certain inferior members by which it is materially assisted in its upward flight .</p>
   <p>In the first place , then , he was one of the most simple and natural of all writers . With the exception of the sacred volume , it would perhaps be impossible to name any compositions with so large a proportion of simple ideas and Saxon monosyllables . He began to be an author when Pope , with his admirable critic Johnson , had established a taste for all that was most ornate , pompous , and complicated in phraseology . But , with due respect for the genius and power of this class of writers , he may be said to have hewn out for himself a new path to glory . It has been justly said by an accomplished modern critic and poet , that , “ between the school of Dryden and Pope , with their few remembered successors , not one of whom ranks now above a fourth-rate poet ; for Young , Thomson , Goldsmith , Gray , and Collins , though flourishing in the interval , were not of their school , but all , in their respective ways , originals ;— between the school of Dryden and Pope , and our undisciplined , independent contemporaries , Cowper stands as having closed the age of the former illustrious masters , and commenced that of the eccentric leaders of the modern fashions in song . We cannot stop to trace the affinity which he bears to either of these generations , so dissimilar from each other ; but it would be easy to show how little he owed to his immediate forerunners , and how much his immediate followers have been indebted to him . All the cant phrases , all the technicalities , of the former school he utterly threw away , and by his rejection of them they became obsolete . He boldly adopted cadences of verse unattempted before , which though frequently uncouth , and sometimes scarcely reducible to rhythm , were not seldom ingeniously significant , and signally energetic . He feared not to employ colloquial , philosophical , judicial idioms , and forms of argument , and illustrations , which enlarged the vocabulary of poetical terms , less by recurring to obsolete ones , ( which has been too prodigally done since ,) than by hazardous , and generally happy innovations of more recent origin , which have become graceful and dignified by usage , though Pope and his imitators durst not have touched them . The eminent adventurous revivers of English poetry about thirty years ago , Southey , Wordsworth , and Coleridge , in their blank verse , trod directly in the steps of Cowper , and , in their early productions at least , were each , in a measure , what he made them . Our author may be legitimately styled the father of this triumvirate , who are , in truth , the living fathers of the innumerable race of moderns , whom no human ingenuity could well classify into their respective schools . "[ 799 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 799 ]</span>Montgomery 's Essay on Cowper 's Poems .</p>
   <p>The simplicity of Cowper as a thinker , examiner , and writer , is unquestionably one of his greatest charms . He constantly reminds us of a highly-gifted and intelligent child . In all that he says and does , there is a total absence of all plot and stratagem , of all pretensions to think profoundly , or write finely ; though , without an effort , he does both . His manner is to invite you to walk abroad with him amidst the glories of nature ; to fix at random on some point in the landscape ; to display its beauties or its peculiarities — to touch on some feature which has , perhaps , altogether escaped your own eye — to pour out the simplest thoughts in the simplest language — and to make you feel that never man before had so sweet , so moral , so devout , so affectionate , so gifted , so musical a companion . The simplicity of his style is , we believe , considering its strength , without a parallel . No author , perhaps , has done more to recover the language of our country from the grasp and tyranny of a foreign idiom , and to teach English people to speak in English accents . In some instances , it may be granted , that he is somewhat more colloquial and homely than the dignity of his subject warrants . But for offences of this kind he makes the amplest compensation , by leading us to those “ wells of undefiled English , ” at which he had drunk so deeply , and whence alone the pure streams of our national composition are to be drawn .</p>
   <p>It is next to be noticed , as to the style of Cowper , that it is as nervous as it is clear and unpretending . It is impossible to compare the works of Addison , and others of the simple class of writers , with Johnson , and those of the opposite class , without feeling that what they gain in simplicity they often lose in strength and power . But the language of Cowper is often to the full as vigorous and masculine as that of Shakspeare . Bring a tyrant or a slave-driver before him for judgment ; and the axe of the one and the scourge of the other are not keener weapons than the words of the poet .</p>
   <p>It would be difficult to find in any writer a more striking example of nervous phraseology than we have in the well-known lines :</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ But hark — the doctor 's voice !— fast wedged between</l>
     <l n="2">Two empirics he stands , and with swoll'n cheeks</l>
     <l n="3">Inspires the news , his trumpet . Keener far</l>
     <l n="4">Than all invective , is his bold harangue ,</l>
     <l n="5">While through that public organ of report</l>
     <l n="6">He hails the clergy ; and defying shame ,</l>
     <l n="7">Announces to the world his own and theirs !</l>
     <l n="8">He teaches those to read , whom schools dismissed</l>
     <l n="9">And colleges , untaught ; sells accent , tone ,</l>
     <l n="10">And emphasis in score , and gives to pray'r</l>
     <l n="11">Th ’ adagio and andante it demands .</l>
     <l n="12">He grinds divinity of other days</l>
     <l n="13">Down into modern use ; transforms old print</l>
     <l n="14">To zigzag manuscript , and cheats the eyes</l>
     <l n="15">Of gall'ry critics by a thousand arts .</l>
     <l n="16">Are there who purchase of the doctor 's ware ?</l>
     <l n="17">O name it not in Gath !— It cannot be ,</l>
     <l n="18">That grave and learned clerks should need such aid .</l>
     <l n="19">He doubtless is in sport , and does but droll ;</l>
     <l n="20">Assuming thus a rank unknown before —</l>
     <l n="21">Grand caterer and dry-nurse of the church ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In the next place , it will not be questioned , we think , by any reader of the preceding letters , that Cowper was a wit of the very highest order — and this quality is by no means confined to his prose , but enters largely into everything that he writes . No author surprises us more frequently with rapid turns and unexpected coincidences . The mock sublime is one of his favourite implements ; and he employs it with almost unrivalled success . There is also a delicacy of touch in his witticisms which is more easily felt than described . And his wit has this noble singularity , that it is never derived from wrong sources , or directed to wrong ends . It never wounds a feeling heart , or deepens the blush upon a modest cheek . Other wits are apt to dip their vessels in any stream which presents itself ; Cowper draws only from the purest fountains . It has been said of Sterne , that he hides his pearls in a ditch , and forces his readers to dive for them ; but the witticisms of Cowper are as well calculated to instruct as to delight .</p>
   <p>This last topic is intimately connected with another , which , in touching on the excellences of Cowper as a poet , cannot be passed over ,— we mean , the astonishing fertility of his imagination . It was observed to the writer of these pages by the late Sir James Mackintosh , of the friend and ornament of his species , William Wilberforce , that “ he was perhaps the finest of all orators of his own particular order — that the wealth of his imagination was such , that no idea seemed to present itself to his mind without its accompanying image or ghost , which he could produce at his pleasure , and which it was a matter of self-denial if he did not produce . ” And the latter part of this criticism might seem to be made for Cowper . His mind appears never to wait for an image , but to be overrun by them . In argument or description — in hurling the thunders of rebuke , or whispering the messages of mercy — he does but wave his wand , and a host of spiritual essences descend to darken or brighten the scenes at his bidding ; to supply new weapons of rebuke , or new visions of love and joy . Some of his personifications are among the finest specimens in any language . What , for example , has more of the genuine spirit of poetry , than the personification of Famine , in the following lines ?—</p>
   <p>“ He calls for Famine ...... ...... and the meagre fiend Blows mildew from between his shrivell 'd lips And taints the golden ear . ”</p>
   <p>What is more lively or forcible than his description of Time ?—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ Time , as he passes us , has a dove 's wing ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unsoiled and swift , and of a silken sound ;</l>

     <l n="4">Theirs , should I paint him , has his pinions fledged</l>
     <l n="5">With motley plumes ; and where the peacock shows</l>
     <l n="6">His azure eyes , is tinctured black and red</l>
     <l n="7">With spots quadrangular of diamond form ,</l>
     <l n="8">Ensanguined hearts , clubs typical of strife ,</l>
     <l n="9">And spades , the emblems of untimely graves .</l>
     <l n="10">What should be and what was an hour-glass once ,</l>
     <l n="11">Become a dice-box , and a billiard mace</l>
     <l n="12">Well does the work of his destructive scythe . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="13">What , again , is superior in this way to his address to Winter ?—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="14">“ O Winter ! ruler of the inverted year !</l>
     <l n="15">Thy scattered hair with sleet-like ashes filled ,</l>

     <l n="17">Fringed with a beard made white with other snows</l>
     <l n="18">Than those of age , thy forehead wrapped in clouds ,</l>
     <l n="19">A lifeless branch thy sceptre , and thy throne</l>
     <l n="20">A sliding car , indebted to no wheels ,</l>
     <l n="21">But urged by storms along its slippery way . ”</l>
    </lg>

   <p>But the examples of this species of personification are without number ; and we are not afraid to bring many of them into comparison with the Discord of Homer , the Fame of Virgil , or the Famine of Ovid — passages of so powerful a cast as at once , and without any assistance , to establish the poetical authority of their inventors .</p>
   <p>It may seem strange to some , that we should assign a place , among the poetical claims of Cowper , to his strong sense . He appears to us to be one of the most just , natural , and rational of all writers ; and , however Poetry may seem to appropriate to herself rather the remote and visionary regions of fiction than that of dull reality , we are disposed to think , that , even in her wildest wanderings , she will maintain no real and permanent ascendency over the mind , if she widely deviates from nature and good sense . “ Monstrous sights , ” says Beattie , and he might have added , monstrous conceptions , “ please but for a moment , if they please at all ; for they derive their charm merely from the beholders ’ amazement . I have read indeed of a man of rank in Sicily who chooses to adorn his villa with pictures and statues of the most unnatural deformity . But it is a singular instance ; and one would not be much more surprised to hear of a man living without food , or growing fat upon poison . To say of anything that it is ‘ contrary to nature , ’ denotes censure and disgust on the part of the speaker ; as the epithet ‘ natural ’ intimates an agreeable quality , and seems , for the most part , to imply that a thing is as it ought to be , suitable to our own taste , and congenial to our own disposition .... Think how we should relish a painting in which there was no regard to colours , proportions , or any of the physical laws of nature ; where the eyes and ears of animals were placed in their shoulders ; where the sky was green , and the grass crimson . ” Such distortions and anomalies would not be less offensive in poetry than in the sister art . And it is one of the main sources of delight in Cowper , that all is in its due proportion , and wears its right colours ; that the “ eyes and ears ” are in “ their proper places ; ” that his skies are blue , and his grass is green ; and that every reflection of the poet has , what he himself calls the</p>
   <p>“ Stamp and clear impression of good sense . ”</p>
   <p>The very passage in the sixth book of “ The Task ” from which this line is taken , and which furnishes perhaps the most perfect uninspired delineation of a true Christian , supplies , at the same time , an admirable example of the quality we mean ; and shows , that even where his feelings were the most intensely interested , his passions were under the control of his reason ; that , when he mounted the chariot of the sun , he took care not to approach too near the flaming luminary .</p>
   <p>It would be impossible , in a sketch such as this , not to advert to the powers of the author as a satirist . And here , we think the most partial critic will be scarcely disposed to deny , that he sometimes handles his knife a little at random and with too much severity . He had early in life been intimate with Churchill ; and , with scarcely a touch of the temper of that right English poet , had plainly caught something of his manner . There is this wide distinction between him and his master — that his irony and rebuke are never the weapons of party , or personality , but of truth , honour , and the public good . The strong , though homely , image applied by Churchill to another critic ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Like a butcher , doom 'd for life</l>
     <l n="2">In his mouth to wear his knife , ” —</l>
   </lg>
   <p>is too just a picture of its author , but is infinitely far from being that of Cowper . It was well said of his satire , that “ it was the offspring of benevolence ; and that , like the Pelian spear , it furnishes the only cure for the wound it inflicts . When he is obliged to blame , he pities ; when he condemns , it is with regret . His censures display no triumphant superiority ; but rather express a turn of feeling such as we might suppose angels to indulge in at the prospect of human frailty . ”</p>
   <p>But , if his satirical powers were sometimes indulged to excess , it is impossible to deny that he was , generally and habitually , of all poets the most sympathizing and tender . Nothing in human composition can surpass the tenderness of the poem on receiving his mother 's picture , or of those exquisite lines addressed to a lady in France suffering under deep calamity , of which last we shall quote a few for the ornament of our page :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The path of sorrow , and that path alone ,</l>
     <l n="2">Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown :</l>
     <l n="3">No trav'ller ever reach 'd that blest abode ,</l>
     <l n="4">Who found not thorns and briers in his road .</l>
     <l n="5">The world may dance along the flowery plain ,</l>
     <l n="6">Cheer 'd as they go by many a sprightly strain ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where Nature has her mossy velvet spread</l>
     <l n="8">With unshod feet they yet securely tread ,</l>
     <l n="9">Admonish 'd , scorn the caution and the friend ,</l>
     <l n="10">Bent all on pleasure , heedless of its end .</l>
     <l n="11">But He , who knew what human hearts would prove ,</l>
     <l n="12">How slow to learn the dictates of his love ,</l>
     <l n="13">That , hard by nature , and of stubborn will ,</l>
     <l n="14">A life of ease would make them harder still ,</l>
     <l n="15">In pity to the souls his grace design 'd</l>
     <l n="16">To rescue from the ruins of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="17">Call 'd for a cloud to darken all their years ,</l>
     <l n="18">And said , ‘ Go , spend them in the vale of tears . ’</l>
     <l n="19">O balmy gales of soul-reviving air !</l>
     <l n="20">O salutary streams that murmur there !</l>
     <l n="21">These flowing from the fount of grace above ,</l>
     <l n="22">Those breathed from lips of everlasting love . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Hymns are almost uniformly of the same character . Drawn from the deep recesses of a broken heart , they find a short and certain way to the bosom of others .</p>
   <p>And this leads to the notice of another peculiarity in his writings . It is said to have been a favourite maxim with Lord Byron , “ that every writer is interesting to others in proportion as he is able and willing to seize and to display to them the hidden workings of his own soul . ” The noble critic is himself a strong exemplification of the truth of his own rule . Not merely his heroes and his heroines , but his rocks , mountains , and rivers , are a sort of fac simile of himself . The blue lake reposing among the mountains is the bard in a state of repose . The thunder leaping from rock to rock is the same mind under the strong excitement of passion . But perhaps of all writers Cowper is the most habitually what may be termed an experimentalist in poetry . He sought in “ the man within , ” the secret machinery by which to touch and to control the world without . He felt deeply ; and caught the feeling as it arose , and transferred it , warm from the heart to his own paper . Hence one great attraction of his writings . “ As face answereth to face in water , so the heart of man to man . ” The sensations of other men are to a great degree our own ; and the poetical exhibition of these sensations is the presenting to us a sort of illuminated mirror , in which we see ourselves , and are , according to the view , moved to sorrow or to joy . Preachers as well as poets will do well to remember this law of our nature , and will endeavour to analyze and to delineate their own feelings , if they mean to reach those of others . Unhappily , the noble author of this canon in philosophy and literature had no very profitable picture of this kind to display to his fellow men . He speaks , however , of “ unmasking the hell that dwelt within . ” And he has taught no unimportant lesson to his species , if he has instructed us in the utter wretchedness of those who , gifted with the noblest powers , refuse to consecrate them to the glorious Giver . But , however unprofitable his own application of the rule , the rule itself is valuable ; and , in the case of Cowper , we have the application of it , both on the largest scale and to the best possible purpose .</p>
   <p>There is one other feature in the mind of Cowper on which , before quitting the subject of this examination , we must be permitted to say a few words . It has been the habit with many , while freely conceding to our poet most of the humbler claims to reputation for which we have contended , to assign him only a second or third place in the scale of poets , on the ground that he is , according to their estimate , altogether “ incapable of the true sublime . ” Now it must be admitted that , if the only true sublimity in writing be to write like Milton , Cowper cannot be ranked in the same class as a poet . Of Milton it may be said , in the words of a poet as great as himself —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ He doth bestride the world</l>
     <l n="2">Like a Colossus : and we petty men</l>
     <l n="3">Walk under his huge legs . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Nothing can be more astonishing than the composure and dignity with which , like his own Satan , he climbs the “ empyreal height ” — sails between worlds and worlds — and moves among thrones and principalities , as if in his natural element . “ The genius of Cowper , ” as it has been justly said , “ did not lead him to emulate the songs of the seraphim : ” but though , in one respect , he moves in a lower region than his great master , in what may be termed the “ moral sublime , ” he is by no means inferior to him . Scarcely any poetry awakens in the mind more of those deep emotions of “ pity and terror , ” which the great critic of antiquity describes as the main sources of the sublime ; and by which poetry is said to “ purge the mind of her votaries . ” In this view of the sublime we know of few passages which surpass the description of “ liberty of soul , ” in the conclusion of the 5th book of “ The Task . ”</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Then liberty , like day ,</l>
     <l n="2">Breaks on the soul ; and , by a flash from heav'n ,</l>
     <l n="3">Fires all the faculties with glorious joy .</l>
     <l n="4">A voice is heard that mortal ears hear not ,</l>
     <l n="5">Till Thou hast touch 'd them ; ‘ tis the voice of song ,</l>
     <l n="6">A loud hosanna sent from all thy works ;</l>
     <l n="7">Which he that hears it with a shout repeats ,</l>
     <l n="8">And adds his rapture to the gen'ral praise .</l>
     <l n="9">In that blest moment , Nature , throwing wide</l>
     <l n="10">Her veil opaque , discloses with a smile</l>
     <l n="11">The Author of her beauties ; who , retir 'd</l>
     <l n="12">Behind His own creation , works unseen</l>
     <l n="13">By the impure , and hears his pow'r denied .</l>
     <l n="14">Thou art the source and centre of all minds ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their only point of rest , eternal Word !</l>
     <l n="16">From Thee departing , they are lost , and rove</l>
     <l n="17">At random , without honour , hope , or peace .</l>
     <l n="18">From Thee is all that soothes the life of man ,</l>
     <l n="19">His high endeavour , and his glad success ,</l>
     <l n="20">His strength to suffer , and his will to serve .</l>
     <l n="21">But , O Thou bounteous Giver of all good ,</l>
     <l n="22">Thou art of all thy gifts thyself the crown !</l>
     <l n="23">Give what thou canst , without thee we are poor ;</l>
     <l n="24">And with thee rich , take what thou wilt away ! ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In like manner the Millennium of Cowper is at least not inferior to the Messiah of Pope . The corresponding passage in the latter writer is greatly inferior to that in which our poet says ,—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ ... No foe to man</l>
     <l n="2">Lurks in the serpent now — the mother sees ,</l>
     <l n="3">And smiles to see , her infant 's hand</l>
     <l n="4">Stretch 'd forth to dally with the crested worm ,</l>
     <l n="5">To stroke his azure neck , and to receive</l>
     <l n="6">The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">And few passages in any poem have more of the true sublime than that</l>
     <l n="8">which follows soon after the last extract :—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">“ One song employs all nations , and all cry</l>
     <l n="10">‘ Worthy the Lamb , for he was slain for us ! ’</l>
     <l n="11">The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks</l>
     <l n="12">Shout to each other , and the mountain tops</l>
     <l n="13">From distant mountains catch the flying joy :</l>
     <l n="14">Till , nation after nation taught the strain ,</l>
     <l n="15">Earth rolls the rapturous hosanna round . ”</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Having offered these general observations “ on the Genius and Poetry ” of Cowper , and having so largely drawn from his sweet and instructive pages , it is not thought necessary to supply any more specific notice of his several poems . It is superfluous to enter upon a detailed proof that his poems in rhyme , though occasionally brightened by passages of extraordinary merit , are often prosaic in their character , and halting and feeble in the versification ; that his shorter poems , whether of a gay or of a devotional cast , are , for pathos , wit , delicacy of conception , and felicity of expression , unequalled in our language ; that his Homer is an evidence , not of his incapacity as a translator , but of the impossibility of transmuting into stiff unyielding English monosyllables the rich compounds of the Greek , without a sacrifice both of sound and sense ; that “ The Task ” outruns in power , variety , depth of thought , fertility of imagination , vigour of expression , in short , in all which constitutes a poet of the highest order , every hope which his earlier poems had allowed his readers to indulge . The dawn gave little or no promise of such a day . The porch was in no sense commensurate to the temple afterwards to be erected .— On the whole , his “ Poems ” will always be considered as one of the richest legacies which genius and virtue have bequeathed to mankind ; and will be welcomed wherever the English language is known , and English minds , tastes , and habits prevail ; wherever the approbation of what is good and the abhorrence of what is evil are felt ; wherever truth is honoured , and God and his creatures are loved .</p>
   <p>With these observations , we bring our imperfect criticisms on the Poems of Cowper to a conclusion . The writer of them does not hesitate to say that he has been amply rewarded for his own critical labours , by the privilege of often escaping from his own page to that of his author . And the reader of them will be still more largely compensated if , when weary of the critic , he will turn aside to breathe an ardent supplication to the Giver of all that was good and great in Cowper , that he himself may drink deeply of the spirit , without participating in the sorrows of this most holy , most distinguished , most suffering , but now most triumphant , servant of the God and Saviour to whom he so nobly and habitually dedicated all his powers .</p>
   <p>PREFACE TO THE POEMS .</p>
   <p>When an author , by appearing in print , requests an audience of the public , and is upon the point of speaking for himself , whoever presumes to step before him with a preface , and to say , “ Nay , but hear me first , ” should have something worthy of attention to offer , or he will be justly deemed officious and impertinent . The judicious reader has probably , upon other occasions , been beforehand with me in this reflection : and I am not very willing it should now be applied to me , however I may seem to expose myself to the danger of it . But the thought of having my own name perpetuated in connexion with the name in the title-page is so pleasing and flattering to the feelings of my heart , that I am content to risk something for the gratification .</p>
   <p>This Preface is not designed to commend the Poems to which it is prefixed . My testimony would be insufficient for those who are not qualified to judge properly for themselves , and unnecessary to those who are . Besides , the reasons which render it improper and unseemly for a man to celebrate his own performances , or those of his nearest relatives , will have some influence in suppressing much of what he might otherwise wish to say in favour of a friend , when that friend is indeed an alter idem , and excites almost the same emotions of sensibility and affection as he feels for himself .</p>
   <p>It is very probable these Poems may come into the hands of some persons , in whom the sight of the author 's name will awaken a recollection of incidents and scenes , which through length of time they had almost forgotten . They will be reminded of one , who was once the companion of their chosen hours , and who set out with them in early life in the paths which lead to literary honours , to influence and affluence , with equal prospects of success . But he was suddenly and powerfully withdrawn from those pursuits , and he left them without regret ; yet not till he had sufficient opportunity of counting the cost , and of knowing the value of what he gave up . If happiness could have been found in classical attainments , in an elegant taste , in the exertions of wit , fancy , and genius , and in the esteem and converse of such persons , as in these respects were most congenial with himself , he would have been happy . But he was not — he wondered ( as thousands in a similar situation still do ) that he should continue dissatisfied , with all the means apparently conducive to satisfaction within his reach — But in due time the cause of his disappointment was discovered to him — he had lived without God in the world . In a memorable hour , the wisdom which is from above visited his heart . Then he felt himself a wanderer , and then he found a guide . Upon this change of views , a change of plan and conduct followed of course . When he saw the busy and the gay world in its true light , he left it with as little reluctance as a prisoner , when called to liberty , leaves his dungeon . Not that he became a Cynic or an Ascetic — a heart filled with love to God will assuredly breathe benevolence to men . But the turn of his temper inclining him to rural life , he indulged it , and , the providence of God evidently preparing his way and marking out his retreat , he retired into the country . By these steps the good hand of God , unknown to me , was providing for me one of the principal blessings of my life ; a friend and a counsellor , in whose company for almost seven years , though we were seldom seven successive waking hours separated , I always found new pleasure — a friend who was not only a comfort to myself , but a blessing to the affectionate poor people among whom I then lived .</p>
   <p>Some time after inclination had thus removed him from the hurry and bustle of life , he was still more secluded by a long indisposition , and my pleasure was succeeded by a proportionable degree of anxiety and concern . But a hope , that the God whom he served would support him under his affliction , and at length vouchsafe him a happy deliverance , never forsook me . The desirable crisis , I trust , is now nearly approaching . The dawn , the presage of returning day , is already arrived . He is again enabled to resume his pen , and some of the first fruits of his recovery are here presented to the public . In his principal subjects , the same acumen , which distinguished him in the early period of life , is happily employed in illustrating and enforcing the truths of which he received such deep and unalterable impressions in his maturer years . His satire , if it may be called so , is benevolent , ( like the operations of the skilful and humane surgeon , who wounds only to heal ,) dictated by a just regard for the honour of God , an indignant grief excited by the profligacy of the age , and a tender compassion for the souls of men .</p>
   <p>His favourite topics are least insisted on in the piece entitled Table Talk ; which therefore , with some regard to the prevailing taste , and that those , who are governed by it , may not be discouraged at the very threshold from proceeding farther , is placed first . In most of the large poems which follow , his leading design is more explicitly avowed and pursued . He aims to communicate his own perceptions of the truth , beauty , and influence of the religion of the Bible — a religion , which , however discredited by the misconduct of many , who have not renounced the Christian name , proves itself , when rightly understood , and cordially embraced , to be the grand desideratum , which alone can relieve the mind of man from painful and unavoidable anxieties , inspire it with stable peace and solid hope , and furnish those motives and prospects which , in the present state of things , are absolutely necessary to produce a conduct worthy of a rational creature , distinguished by a vastness of capacity which no assemblage of earthly good can satisfy , and by a principle and pre-intimation of immortality .</p>
   <p>At a time when hypothesis and conjecture in philosophy are so justly exploded , and little is considered as deserving the name of knowledge , which will not stand the test of experiment , the very use of the term experimental in religious concernments is by too many unhappily rejected with disgust . But we well know , that they , who affect to despise the inward feelings which religious persons speak of , and to treat them as enthusiasm and folly , have inward feelings of their own , which , though they would , they cannot , suppress . We have been too long in the secret ourselves , to account the proud , the ambitious , or the voluptuous , happy . We must lose the remembrance of what we once were , before we can believe that a man is satisfied with himself , merely because he endeavours to appear so . A smile upon the face is often but a mask worn occasionally and in company , to prevent , if possible , a suspicion of what at the same time is passing in the heart . We know that there are people who seldom smile when they are alone , who therefore are glad to hide themselves in a throng from the violence of their own reflections ; and who , while by their looks and their language they wish to persuade us they are happy , would be glad to change their conditions with a dog . But in defiance of all their efforts they continue to think , forbode , and tremble . This we know , for it has been our own state , and therefore we know how to commiserate it in others .— From this state the Bible relieved us — when we were led to read it with attention , we found ourselves described . We learned the causes of our inquietude — we were directed to a method of relief — we tried , and we were not disappointed .</p>
   <p>Deus nobis hæc otia fecit .</p>
   <p>We are now certain that the gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth . It has reconciled us to God , and to ourselves , to our duty and our situation . It is the balm and cordial of the present life , and a sovereign antidote against the fear of death .</p>
   <p>Sed hactenus hæc . Some smaller pieces upon less important subjects close the volume . Not one of them , I believe , was written with a view to publication , but I was unwilling they should be omitted .</p>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Origin of error — Man endowed with freedom of will — Motives for action — Attractions of music — The chase — Those amusements not suited to the Clergy — Case of Occiduus — Force of example — Due observance of the Sabbath — Cards and dancing — The drunkard and the coxcomb — Folly and innocence — Hurtful pleasures — Virtuous pleasures — Effects of the inordinate indulgence of pleasure — Dangerous tendency of many works of imagination — Apostrophe to Lord Chesterfield — Our earliest years the most important — Fashionable education — The grand tour — Accomplishments have taken the place of virtue — Qualities requisite in a critic of the Bible — Power of the press — Solicitude of enthusiasm to make proselytes — Fondness of authors for their literary progeny — The blunderer impatient of contradiction — Moral faults and errors of the understanding reciprocally produce one another — The cup of pleasure to be tasted with caution — Force of habit — The wanderer from the right path directed to the Cross .</head>
     <l n="1">Sing , muse ( if such a theme , so dark , so long ,</l>
     <l n="2">May find a muse to grace it with a song ) ,</l>
     <l n="3">By what unseen and unsuspected arts</l>
     <l n="4">The serpent Error twines round human hearts ;</l>
     <l n="5">Tell where she lurks , beneath what flowery shades ,</l>
     <l n="6">That not a glimpse of genuine light pervades ,</l>
     <l n="7">The poisonous , black , insinuating worm</l>
     <l n="8">Successfully conceals her loathsome form .</l>
     <l n="9">Take , if ye can , ye careless and supine ,</l>
     <l n="10">Counsel and caution from a voice like mine !</l>
     <l n="11">Truths , that the theorist could never reach ,</l>
     <l n="12">And observation taught me , I would teach .</l>
     <l n="13">Not all , whose eloquence the fancy fills ,</l>
     <l n="14">Musical as the chime of tinkling rills ,</l>
     <l n="15">Weak to perform , though mighty to pretend ,</l>
     <l n="16">Can trace her mazy windings to their end ;</l>
     <l n="17">Discern the fraud beneath the specious lure ,</l>
     <l n="18">Prevent the danger , or prescribe the cure .</l>
     <l n="19">The clear harangue , and cold as it is clear ,</l>
     <l n="20">Falls soporific on the listless ear ;</l>
     <l n="21">Like quicksilver , the rhetoric they display</l>
     <l n="22">Shines as it runs , but , grasp 'd at , slips away .</l>
     <l n="23">Placed for his trial on this bustling stage ,</l>
     <l n="24">From thoughtless youth to ruminating age ,</l>
     <l n="25">Free in his will to choose or to refuse ,</l>
     <l n="26">Man may improve the crisis , or abuse ;</l>
     <l n="27">Else , on the fatalist 's unrighteous plan ,</l>
     <l n="28">Say , to what bar amenable were man ?</l>
     <l n="29">With nought in charge he could betray no trust :</l>
     <l n="30">And , if he fell , would fall because he must ;</l>
     <l n="31">If love reward him , or if vengeance strike ,</l>
     <l n="32">His recompence in both unjust alike .</l>
     <l n="33">Divine authority within his breast</l>
     <l n="34">Brings every thought , word , action , to the test ;</l>
     <l n="35">Warns him or prompts , approves him or restrains ,</l>
     <l n="36">As reason , or as passion , takes the reins .</l>
     <l n="37">Heaven from above , and conscience from within ,</l>
     <l n="38">Cries in his startled ear — Abstain from sin !</l>
     <l n="39">The world around solicits his desire ,</l>
     <l n="40">And kindles in his soul a treacherous fire ;</l>
     <l n="41">While , all his purposes and steps to guard ,</l>
     <l n="42">Peace follows virtue as its sure reward ;</l>
     <l n="43">And pleasure brings as surely in her train</l>
     <l n="44">Remorse , and sorrow , and vindictive pain .</l>
     <l n="45">Man , thus endued with an elective voice ,</l>
     <l n="46">Must be supplied with objects of his choice ,</l>
     <l n="47">Where'er he turns , enjoyment and delight ,</l>
     <l n="48">Or present or in prospect , meet his sight :</l>
     <l n="49">Those open on the spot their honeyed store ;</l>
     <l n="50">These call him loudly to pursuit of more .</l>
     <l n="51">His unexhausted mine the sordid vice</l>
     <l n="52">Avarice shows , and virtue is the price .</l>
     <l n="53">Here various motives his ambition raise —</l>
     <l n="54">Power , pomp , and splendour , and the thirst of praise ;</l>
     <l n="55">There beauty wooes him with expanded arms ;</l>
     <l n="56">E'en bacchanalian madness has its charms .</l>
     <l n="57">Nor these alone , whose pleasures less refined</l>
     <l n="58">Might well alarm the most unguarded mind ,</l>
     <l n="59">Seek to supplant his inexperienced youth ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or lead him devious from the path of truth ;</l>
     <l n="61">Hourly allurements on his passions press ,</l>
     <l n="62">Safe in themselves , but dangerous in the excess .</l>
     <l n="63">Hark ! how it floats upon the dewy air !</l>
     <l n="64">O what a dying , dying close was there !</l>
     <l n="65">‘ Tis harmony , from yon sequester 'd bower .</l>
     <l n="66">Sweet harmony , that soothes the midnight hour !</l>
     <l n="67">Long ere the charioteer of day had run</l>
     <l n="68">His morning course the enchantment was begun ;</l>
     <l n="69">And he shall gild yon mountain 's height again ,</l>
     <l n="70">Ere yet the pleasing toil becomes a pain .</l>
     <l n="71">Is this the rugged path , the steep ascent ,</l>
     <l n="72">That virtue points to ? Can a life thus spent</l>
     <l n="73">Lead to the bliss she promises the wise ,</l>
     <l n="74">Detach the soul from earth , and speed her to the skies ?</l>
     <l n="75">Ye devotees to your adored employ ,</l>
     <l n="76">Enthusiasts , drunk with an unreal joy ,</l>
     <l n="77">Love makes the music of the blest above ,</l>
     <l n="78">Heaven 's harmony is universal love ;</l>
     <l n="79">And earthly sounds , though sweet and well combined ,</l>
     <l n="80">And lenient as soft opiates to the mind ,</l>
     <l n="81">Leave vice and folly unsubdued behind .</l>
     <l n="82">Grey dawn appears ; the sportsman and his train</l>
     <l n="83">Speckle the bosom of the distant plain ;</l>

     <l n="85">Save that his scent is less acute than theirs ,</l>
     <l n="86">For persevering chase , and headlong leaps ,</l>
     <l n="87">True beagle as the stanchest hound he keeps .</l>
     <l n="88">Charged with the folly of his life 's mad scene ,</l>
     <l n="89">He takes offence , and wonders what you mean ;</l>
     <l n="90">The joy the danger and the toil o'erpays —</l>
     <l n="91">‘ Tis exercise , and health , and length of days .</l>
     <l n="92">Again impetuous to the field he flies ;</l>
     <l n="93">Leaps every fence but one , there falls and dies ;</l>
     <l n="94">Like a slain deer , the tumbrel brings him home ,</l>
     <l n="95">Unmiss 'd but by his dogs and by his groom .</l>
     <l n="96">Ye clergy , while your orbit is your place ,</l>

     <l n="103">With the same ease that man puts on his gown ?</l>
     <l n="104">Will avarice and concupiscence give place ,</l>
     <l n="105">Charm 'd by the sounds — Your Reverence , or your Grace ?</l>
     <l n="106">No . But his own engagement binds him fast ;</l>

     <l n="108">What atheists call him — a designing knave ,</l>
     <l n="109">A mere church juggler , hypocrite and slave .</l>
     <l n="110">Oh , laugh or mourn with me the rueful jest ,</l>
     <l n="111">A cassock 'd huntsman and a fiddling priest !</l>

     <l n="114">He takes the field . The master of the pack</l>
     <l n="115">Cries — Well done , saint ! and claps him on the back .</l>
     <l n="116">Is this the path of sanctity ? Is this</l>
     <l n="117">To stand a waymark on the road to bliss ?</l>
     <l n="118">Himself a wanderer from the narrow way ,</l>
     <l n="119">His silly sheep , what wonder if they stray ?</l>
     <l n="120">Go , cast your orders at your bishop 's feet ,</l>

     <l n="168">Their answer to the call is — Not at home .</l>
     <l n="169">O the dear pleasures of the velvet plain ,</l>
     <l n="170">The painted tablets , dealt and dealt again !</l>
     <l n="171">Cards , with what rapture , and the polish 'd die ,</l>
     <l n="172">The yawning chasm of indolence supply !</l>
     <l n="173">Then to the dance , and make the sober moon</l>
     <l n="174">Witness of joys that shun the sight of noon .</l>
     <l n="175">Blame , cynic , if you can , quadrille or ball ,</l>
     <l n="176">The snug close party , or the splendid hall ,</l>
     <l n="177">Where Night , down stooping from her ebon throne ,</l>
     <l n="178">Views constellations brighter than her own .</l>
     <l n="179">‘ Tis innocent , and harmless , and refined ,</l>
     <l n="180">The balm of care , Elysium of the mind .</l>
     <l n="181">Innocent ! Oh , if venerable Time</l>
     <l n="182">Slain at the foot of Pleasure be no crime ,</l>
     <l n="183">Then , with his silver beard and magic wand ,</l>
     <l n="184">Let Comus rise archbishop of the land ;</l>
     <l n="185">Let him your rubric and your feasts prescribe ,</l>
     <l n="186">Grand metropolitan of all the tribe .</l>
     <l n="187">Of manners rough , and coarse athletic cast ,</l>
     <l n="188">The rank debauch suits Clodio 's filthy taste .</l>
     <l n="189">Rufillus , exquisitely form 'd by rule ,</l>
     <l n="190">Not of the moral but the dancing school ,</l>
     <l n="191">Wonders at Clodio 's follies , in a tone</l>
     <l n="192">As tragical as others at his own .</l>
     <l n="193">He cannot drink five bottles , bilk the score ,</l>
     <l n="194">Then kill a constable , and drink five more ;</l>
     <l n="195">But he can draw a pattern , make a tart ,</l>
     <l n="196">And has the ladies ’ etiquette by heart .</l>
     <l n="197">Go , fool ; and , arm in arm with Clodio , plead</l>
     <l n="198">Your cause before a bar you little dread ;</l>
     <l n="199">But know , the law that bids the drunkard die</l>
     <l n="200">Is far too just to pass the trifler by .</l>
     <l n="201">Both baby-featured , and of infant size ,</l>
     <l n="202">View 'd from a distance , and with heedless eyes ,</l>
     <l n="203">Folly and innocence are so alike ,</l>
     <l n="204">The difference , though essential , fails to strike .</l>
     <l n="205">Yet Folly ever has a vacant stare ,</l>
     <l n="206">A simpering countenance , and a trifling air ;</l>
     <l n="207">But Innocence , sedate , serene , erect ,</l>
     <l n="208">Delights us , by engaging our respect .</l>
     <l n="209">Man , Nature 's guest by invitation sweet ,</l>
     <l n="210">Receives from her both appetite and treat ;</l>
     <l n="211">But , if he play the glutton and exceed ,</l>
     <l n="212">His benefactress blushes at the deed .</l>
     <l n="213">For Nature , nice , as liberal to dispense ,</l>
     <l n="214">Made nothing but a brute the slave of sense .</l>
     <l n="215">Daniel ate pulse by choice — example rare !</l>
     <l n="216">Heaven bless 'd the youth , and made him fresh and fair .</l>
     <l n="217">Gorgonius sits , abdominous and wan ,</l>
     <l n="218">Like a fat squab upon a Chinese fan :</l>

     <l n="220">Turtle and venison all his thoughts employ ;</l>
     <l n="221">Prepares for meals as jockeys take a sweat ,</l>
     <l n="222">Oh , nauseous !— an emetic for a whet !</l>
     <l n="223">Will Providence o'erlook the wasted good ?</l>
     <l n="224">Temperance were no virtue if he could .</l>
     <l n="225">That pleasures , therefore , or what such we call ,</l>
     <l n="226">Are hurtful , is a truth confess 'd by all .</l>
     <l n="227">And some , that seem to threaten virtue less</l>
     <l n="228">Still hurtful in the abuse , or by the excess .</l>
     <l n="229">Is man then only for his torment placed</l>
     <l n="230">The centre of delights he may not taste ?</l>
     <l n="231">Like fabled Tantalus , condemn 'd to hear</l>
     <l n="232">The precious stream still purling in his ear ,</l>
     <l n="233">Lip-deep in what he longs for , and yet curst</l>
     <l n="234">With prohibition and perpetual thirst ?</l>
     <l n="235">No , wrangler — destitute of shame and sense ,</l>
     <l n="236">The precept , that enjoins him abstinence ,</l>
     <l n="237">Forbids him none but the licentious joy ,</l>
     <l n="238">Whose fruit , though fair , tempts only to destroy .</l>
     <l n="239">Remorse , the fatal egg by Pleasure laid</l>
     <l n="240">In every bosom where her nest is made ,</l>
     <l n="241">Hatch 'd by the beams of truth , denies him rest ,</l>
     <l n="242">And proves a raging scorpion in his breast .</l>
     <l n="243">No pleasure ? Are domestic comforts dead ?</l>
     <l n="244">Are all the nameless sweets of friendship fled ?</l>
     <l n="245">Has time worn out , or fashion put to shame ,</l>
     <l n="246">Good sense , good health , good conscience , and good fame ?</l>
     <l n="247">All these belong to virtue , and all prove</l>
     <l n="248">That virtue has a title to your love .</l>
     <l n="249">Have you no touch of pity , that the poor</l>
     <l n="250">Stand starved at your inhospitable door ?</l>
     <l n="251">Or if yourself , too scantily supplied ,</l>
     <l n="252">Need help , let honest industry provide .</l>
     <l n="253">Earn , if you want ; if you abound , impart :</l>
     <l n="254">These both are pleasures to the feeling heart .</l>
     <l n="255">No pleasure ? Has some sickly eastern waste</l>
     <l n="256">Sent us a wind to parch us at a blast ?</l>
     <l n="257">Can British Paradise no scenes afford</l>
     <l n="258">To please her sated and indifferent lord ?</l>
     <l n="259">Are sweet philosophy 's enjoyments run</l>
     <l n="260">Quite to the lees ? And has religion none ?</l>
     <l n="261">Brutes capable would tell you ‘ tis a lie ,</l>
     <l n="262">And judge you from the kennel and the stye .</l>
     <l n="263">Delights like these , ye sensual and profane ,</l>
     <l n="264">Ye are bid , begg 'd , besought , to entertain ;</l>
     <l n="265">Call 'd to these crystal streams , do ye turn off</l>
     <l n="266">Obscene to swill and swallow at a trough ?</l>
     <l n="267">Envy the beast , then , on whom Heaven bestows</l>
     <l n="268">Your pleasures , with no curses at the close .</l>
     <l n="269">Pleasure admitted in undue degree</l>
     <l n="270">Enslaves the will , nor leaves the judgment free .</l>
     <l n="271">‘ Tis not alone the grape 's enticing juice</l>
     <l n="272">Unnerves the moral powers , and mars their use ;</l>
     <l n="273">Ambition , avarice , and the lust of fame ,</l>
     <l n="274">And woman , lovely woman , does the same .</l>
     <l n="275">The heart , surrender 'd to the ruling power</l>
     <l n="276">Of some ungovern 'd passion every hour ,</l>
     <l n="277">Finds by degrees the truths that once bore sway ,</l>
     <l n="278">And all their deep impressions , wear away ;</l>
     <l n="279">So coin grows smooth , in traffic current pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="280">Till Cæsar 's image is effaced at last .</l>
     <l n="281">The breach , though small at first , soon opening wide ,</l>
     <l n="282">In rushes folly with a full-moon tide ,</l>
     <l n="283">Then welcome errors , of whatever size ,</l>
     <l n="284">To justify it by a thousand lies .</l>
     <l n="285">As creeping ivy clings to wood or stone ,</l>
     <l n="286">And hides the ruin that it feeds upon ;</l>
     <l n="287">So sophistry cleaves close to and protects</l>
     <l n="288">Sin 's rotten trunk , concealing its defects .</l>
     <l n="289">Mortals , whose pleasures are their only care ,</l>
     <l n="290">First wish to be imposed on , and then are .</l>
     <l n="291">And lest the fulsome artifice should fail ,</l>
     <l n="292">Themselves will hide its coarseness with a veil .</l>
     <l n="293">Not more industrious are the just and true</l>
     <l n="294">To give to Virtue what is Virtue 's due —</l>
     <l n="295">The praise of wisdom , comeliness , and worth ,</l>
     <l n="296">And call her charms to public notice forth —</l>
     <l n="297">Than Vice 's mean and disingenuous race</l>
     <l n="298">To hide the shocking features of her face .</l>
     <l n="299">Her form with dress and lotion they repair ;</l>
     <l n="300">Then kiss their idol , and pronounce her fair .</l>
     <l n="301">The sacred implement I now employ</l>
     <l n="302">Might prove a mischief , or at best a toy ;</l>
     <l n="303">A trifle , if it move but to amuse ;</l>
     <l n="304">But , if to wrong the judgment and abuse ,</l>
     <l n="305">Worse than a poniard in the basest hand ,</l>
     <l n="306">It stabs at once the morals of a land .</l>
     <l n="307">Ye writers of what none with safety reads ,</l>
     <l n="308">Footing it in the dance that Fancy leads ;</l>
     <l n="309">Ye novelists , who mar what ye would mend ,</l>
     <l n="310">Snivelling and drivelling folly without end ;</l>
     <l n="311">Whose corresponding misses fill the ream</l>
     <l n="312">With sentimental frippery and dream ,</l>
     <l n="313">Caught in a delicate soft silken net</l>
     <l n="314">By some lewd earl , or rake-hell baronet :</l>
     <l n="315">Ye pimps , who , under virtue 's fair pretence ,</l>
     <l n="316">Steal to the closet of young innocence ,</l>
     <l n="317">And teach her , inexperienced yet and green ,</l>
     <l n="318">To scribble as you scribbled at fifteen ;</l>
     <l n="319">Who , kindling a combustion of desire ,</l>
     <l n="320">With some cold moral think to quench the fire ;</l>
     <l n="321">Though all your engineering proves in vain</l>
     <l n="322">The dribbling stream ne'er puts it out again :</l>
     <l n="323">Oh that a verse had power , and could command</l>
     <l n="324">Far , far away , these flesh-flies of the land ,</l>
     <l n="325">Who fasten without mercy on the fair ,</l>
     <l n="326">And suck , and leave a craving maggot there !</l>
     <l n="327">Howe'er disguised the inflammatory tale ,</l>
     <l n="328">And cover 'd with a fine-spun specious veil ;</l>

     <l n="330">And relish of their pleasure all to lust .</l>
     <l n="331">But the muse , eagle-pinion 'd , has in view</l>
     <l n="332">A quarry more important still than you ;</l>
     <l n="333">Down , down the wind she swims , and sails away ,</l>
     <l n="334">Now stoops upon it , and now grasps the prey .</l>
     <l n="335">Petronius ! all the muses weep for thee ;</l>

     <l n="337">The graces too , while Virtue at their shrine</l>
     <l n="338">Lay bleeding under that soft hand of thine ,</l>
     <l n="339">Felt each a mortal stab in her own breast ,</l>
     <l n="340">Abhorr 'd the sacrifice , and cursed the priest .</l>

     <l n="345">Then pour it on the morals of thy son ,</l>
     <l n="346">To taint his heart , was worthy of thine own !</l>
     <l n="347">Now , while the poison all high life pervades ,</l>
     <l n="348">Write , if thou canst , one letter from the shades ,</l>
     <l n="349">One , and one only , charged with deep regret ,</l>
     <l n="350">That thy worst part , thy principles , live yet ;</l>
     <l n="351">One sad epistle thence may cure mankind</l>
     <l n="352">Of the plague spread by bundles left behind .</l>
     <l n="353">‘ Tis granted , and no plainer truth appears ,</l>
     <l n="354">Our most important are our earliest years ;</l>
     <l n="355">The mind , impressible and soft , with ease</l>
     <l n="356">Imbibes and copies what she hears and sees ,</l>
     <l n="357">And through life 's labyrinth holds fast the clue</l>

     <l n="359">Plants raised with tenderness are seldom strong ;</l>
     <l n="360">Man 's coltish disposition asks the thong ;</l>

     <l n="368">Praise his proficiency , and dub him man .</l>
     <l n="369">From school to Cam or Isis , and thence home ;</l>

     <l n="371">With reverend tutor , clad in habit lay ,</l>
     <l n="372">To tease for cash , and quarrel with all day ;</l>

     <l n="473">Eternal truth by everlasting doubt ;</l>
     <l n="474">Church quacks , with passions under no command ,</l>
     <l n="475">Who fill the world with doctrines contraband ,</l>
     <l n="476">Discoverers of they know not what , confined</l>

     <l n="489">Your sober thoughts will hardly find it one .</l>

     <l n="516">None but an author knows an author 's cares ,</l>
     <l n="517">Or Fancy 's fondness for the child she bears .</l>
     <l n="518">Committed once into the public arms ,</l>

     <l n="544">Tell him he wanders ; that his error leads</l>

     <l n="547">Death and the pains of hell attend him there :</l>
     <l n="548">In vain ; the slave of arrogance and pride ,</l>
     <l n="549">He has no hearing on the prudent side .</l>
     <l n="550">His still refuted quirks he still repeats ;</l>
     <l n="551">New raised objections with new quibbles meets ;</l>
     <l n="552">Till , sinking in the quicksand he defends ,</l>

     <l n="554">But not the mischiefs ; they , still left behind ,</l>
     <l n="555">Like thistle-seeds , are sown by every wind .</l>
     <l n="556">Thus men go wrong with an ingenious skill ;</l>

     <l n="558">And , with a clear and shining lamp supplied ,</l>
     <l n="559">First put it out , then take it for a guide .</l>
     <l n="560">Halting on crutches of unequal size ,</l>
     <l n="561">One leg by truth supported , one by lies ,</l>
     <l n="562">They sidle to the goal with awkward pace ,</l>
     <l n="563">Secure of nothing — but to lose the race .</l>
     <l n="564">Faults in the life breed errors in the brain ,</l>
     <l n="565">And these reciprocally those again .</l>

     <l n="569">Begetting and conceiving all that 's base .</l>
     <l n="570">None sends his arrow to the mark in view ,</l>
     <l n="571">Whose hand is feeble , or his aim untrue .</l>
     <l n="572">For though , ere yet the shaft is on the wing ,</l>
     <l n="573">Or when it first forsakes the elastic string ,</l>
     <l n="574">It err but little from the intended line ,</l>
     <l n="575">It falls at last far wide of his design ;</l>
     <l n="576">So he who seeks a mansion in the sky ,</l>

     <l n="590">There hardening by degrees , till double steel 'd ,</l>
     <l n="591">Take leave of nature 's God , and God reveal 'd ;</l>

     <l n="593">And , joining the freethinkers ’ brutal roar ,</l>
     <l n="594">Swallow the two grand nostrums they dispense —</l>
     <l n="595">That Scripture lies , and blasphemy is sense .</l>
     <l n="596">If clemency revolted by abuse</l>
     <l n="597">Be damnable , then damn 'd without excuse .</l>
     <l n="598">Some dream that they can silence , when they will ,</l>
     <l n="599">The storm of passion , and say , Peace , be still :</l>

     <l n="601">To the wild wave , or wilder human breast ,</l>
     <l n="602">Implies authority that never can ,</l>
     <l n="603">That never ought to be the lot of man .</l>
     <l n="604">But , muse , forbear ; long flights forebode a fall ;</l>
     <l n="605">Strike on the deep-toned chord the sum of all .</l>
     <l n="606">Hear the just law — the judgment of the skies !</l>

     <l n="608">And he that will be cheated to the last ,</l>
     <l n="609">Delusions strong as hell shall bind him fast .</l>
     <l n="610">But if the wanderer his mistake discern ,</l>
     <l n="611">Judge his own ways , and sigh for a return ,</l>
     <l n="612">Bewilder 'd once , must he bewail his loss</l>
     <l n="613">For ever and for ever ? No — the cross !</l>
     <l n="614">There and there only ( though the deist rave ,</l>
     <l n="615">And atheist , if Earth bear so base a slave ) ;</l>
     <l n="616">There and there only is the power to save .</l>
     <l n="617">There no delusive hope invites despair ;</l>
     <l n="618">No mockery meets you , no deception there .</l>
     <l n="619">The spells and charms , that blinded you before ,</l>
     <l n="620">All vanish there , and fascinate no more .</l>
     <l n="621">I am no preacher , let this hint suffice —</l>
     <l n="622">The cross once seen is death to every vice ;</l>
     <l n="623">Else He that hung there suffer 'd all his pain ,</l>
     <l n="624">Bled , groan 'd , and agonized , and died , in vain .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The pursuit of error leads to destruction — Grace leads the right way — Its direction despised — The self-sufficient Pharisee compared with the peacock — The pheasant compared with the Christian — Heaven abhors affected sanctity — The hermit and his penances — The self-torturing Bramin — Pride the ruling principle of both — Picture of a sanctimonious prude — Picture of a saint — Freedom of a Christian — Importance of motives , illustrated by the conduct of two servants — The traveller overtaken by a storm likened to the sinner dreading the vengeance of the Almighty — Dangerous state of those who are just in their own conceit — The last moments of the infidel — Content of the ignorant but believing cottager — The rich , the wise , and the great , neglect the means of winning heaven — Poverty the best soil for religion — What man really is , and what in his own esteem — Unbelief often terminates in suicide — Scripture the only cure of woe — Pride the passion most hostile to truth — Danger of slighting the mercy offered by the Gospel — Plea for the virtuous heathen — Commands given by God on Sinai — The judgment-day — Plea of the believer .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Man , on the dubious waves of error toss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="2">His ship half founder 'd , and his compass lost ,</l>
     <l n="3">Sees , far as human optics may command ,</l>
     <l n="4">A sleeping fog , and fancies it dry land ;</l>
     <l n="5">Spreads all his canvas , every sinew plies ;</l>
     <l n="6">Pants for it , aims at it , enters it , and dies !</l>
     <l n="7">Then farewell all self-satisfying schemes ,</l>
     <l n="8">His well-built systems , philosophic dreams ;</l>
     <l n="9">Deceitful views of future bliss , farewell !</l>
     <l n="10">He reads his sentence at the flames of hell .</l>
     <l n="11">Hard lot of man — to toil for the reward</l>
     <l n="12">Of virtue , and yet lose it ! Wherefore hard ?—</l>
     <l n="13">He that would win the race must guide his horse</l>
     <l n="14">Obedient to the customs of the course ;</l>
     <l n="15">Else , though unequall 'd to the goal he flies ,</l>
     <l n="16">A meaner than himself shall gain the prize .</l>
     <l n="17">Grace leads the right way : if you choose the wrong ,</l>
     <l n="18">Take it and perish ; but restrain your tongue ;</l>
     <l n="19">Charge not , with light sufficient and left free ,</l>
     <l n="20">Your wilful suicide on God 's decree .</l>
     <l n="21">Oh how unlike the complex works of man ,</l>
     <l n="22">Heav'n ' s easy , artless , unencumber 'd plan !</l>
     <l n="23">No meretricious graces to beguile ,</l>
     <l n="24">No clustering ornaments to clog the pile ;</l>
     <l n="25">From ostentation , as from weakness , free ,</l>
     <l n="26">It stands like the cerulian arch we see ,</l>
     <l n="27">Majestic in its own simplicity .</l>
     <l n="28">Inscribed above the portal , from afar</l>
     <l n="29">Conspicuous as the brightness of a star ,</l>
     <l n="30">Legible only by the light they give ,</l>
     <l n="31">Stand the soul-quickening words — BELIEVE , AND LIVE .</l>
     <l n="32">Too many , shock 'd at what should charm them most ,</l>
     <l n="33">Despise the plain direction , and are lost .</l>
     <l n="34">Heaven on such terms ! ( they cry with proud disdain )</l>
     <l n="35">Incredible , impossible , and vain !—</l>
     <l n="36">Rebel , because ‘ tis easy to obey ;</l>
     <l n="37">And scorn , for its own sake , the gracious way .</l>
     <l n="38">These are the sober , in whose cooler brains</l>
     <l n="39">Some thought of immortality remains ;</l>
     <l n="40">The rest too busy or too gay to wait</l>
     <l n="41">On the sad theme , their everlasting state ,</l>
     <l n="42">Sport for a day , and perish in a night ;</l>
     <l n="43">The foam upon the waters not so light .</l>
     <l n="44">Who judged the Pharisee ! What odious cause</l>
     <l n="45">Exposed him to the vengeance of the laws ?</l>
     <l n="46">Had he seduced a virgin , wrong 'd a friend ,</l>
     <l n="47">Or stabb 'd a man to serve some private end ?</l>
     <l n="48">Was blasphemy his sin ? Or did he stray</l>
     <l n="49">From the strict duties of the sacred day ?</l>
     <l n="50">Sit long and late at the carousing board ?</l>
     <l n="51">( Such were the sins with which he charged his Lord . )</l>
     <l n="52">No — the man 's morals were exact . What then ?</l>
     <l n="53">‘ Twas his ambition to be seen of men ;</l>
     <l n="54">His virtues were his pride ; and that one vice</l>
     <l n="55">Made all his virtues gewgaws of no price ;</l>
     <l n="56">He wore them as fine trappings for a show ,</l>
     <l n="57">A praying , synagogue-frequenting beau .</l>
     <l n="58">The self-applauding bird , the peacock , see —</l>

     <l n="60">Meridian sunbeams tempt him to unfold</l>
     <l n="61">His radiant glories , azure , green , and gold :</l>
     <l n="62">He treads as if , some solemn music near ,</l>
     <l n="63">His measured step were govern 'd by his ear ;</l>
     <l n="64">And seems to say — Ye meaner fowl give place ;</l>
     <l n="65">I am all splendour , dignity , and grace !</l>
     <l n="66">Not so the pheasant on his charms presumes ,</l>
     <l n="67">Though he , too , has a glory in his plumes .</l>
     <l n="68">He , Christian-like , retreats with modest mien</l>
     <l n="69">To the close copse or far sequester 'd green ,</l>
     <l n="70">And shines without desiring to be seen .</l>
     <l n="71">The plea of works , as arrogant and vain ,</l>
     <l n="72">Heaven turns from with abhorrence and disdain ;</l>
     <l n="73">Not more affronted by avowed neglect ,</l>
     <l n="74">Than by the mere dissembler 's feign 'd respect .</l>
     <l n="75">What is all righteousness that men devise ?</l>
     <l n="76">What — but a sordid bargain for the skies ?</l>
     <l n="77">But Christ as soon would abdicate his own ,</l>
     <l n="78">As stoop from heaven to sell the proud a throne .</l>
     <l n="79">His dwelling a recess in some rude rock ;</l>
     <l n="80">Book , beads , and maple dish , his meagre stock ;</l>
     <l n="81">In shirt of hair and weeds of canvas dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="82">Girt with a bell-rope that the pope has bless 'd ;</l>
     <l n="83">Adust with stripes told out for every crime ,</l>
     <l n="84">And sore tormented , long before his time ;</l>
     <l n="85">His prayer preferr 'd to saints that cannot aid ,</l>
     <l n="86">His praise postponed , and never to be paid ;</l>
     <l n="87">See the sage hermit , by mankind admired ,</l>
     <l n="88">With all that bigotry adopts inspired ,</l>
     <l n="89">Wearing out life in his religious whim ,</l>
     <l n="90">Till his religious whimsy wears out him .</l>
     <l n="91">His works , his abstinence , his zeal allow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="92">You think him humble — God accounts him proud .</l>
     <l n="93">High in demand , though lowly in pretence ,</l>
     <l n="94">Of all his conduct this the genuine sense —</l>
     <l n="95">My penitential stripes , my streaming blood ,</l>
     <l n="96">Have purchased heaven , and proved my title good .</l>
     <l n="97">Turn eastward now , and fancy shall apply</l>
     <l n="98">To your weak sight her telescopic eye .</l>
     <l n="99">The bramin kindles on his own bare head</l>
     <l n="100">The sacred fire , self-torturing his trade !</l>
     <l n="101">His voluntary pains , severe and long ,</l>
     <l n="102">Would give a barbarous air to British song ;</l>
     <l n="103">No grand inquisitor could worse invent ,</l>
     <l n="104">Than he contrives to suffer well content .</l>
     <l n="105">Which is the saintlier worthy of the two ?</l>
     <l n="106">Past all dispute , yon anchorite , say you .</l>
     <l n="107">Your sentence and mine differ . What 's a name ?</l>
     <l n="108">I say the bramin has the fairer claim .</l>
     <l n="109">If sufferings scripture nowhere recommends ,</l>
     <l n="110">Devised by self , to answer selfish ends ,</l>
     <l n="111">Give saintship , then all Europe must agree</l>
     <l n="112">Ten starveling hermits suffer less than he .</l>
     <l n="113">The truth is ( if the truth may suit your ear ,</l>
     <l n="114">And prejudice have left a passage clear )</l>
     <l n="115">Pride has attained a most luxuriant growth ,</l>
     <l n="116">And poison 'd every virtue in them both .</l>
     <l n="117">Pride may be pamper 'd while the flesh grows lean ;</l>
     <l n="118">Humility may clothe an English dean ;</l>
     <l n="119">That grace was Cowper 's — his , confess 'd by all —</l>
     <l n="120">Though placed in golden Durham 's second stall .</l>
     <l n="121">Not all the plenty of a bishop 's board ,</l>
     <l n="122">His palace , and his lacqueys , and “ My Lord , ”</l>
     <l n="123">More nourish pride , that condescending vice ,</l>
     <l n="124">Than abstinence , and beggary , and lice ;</l>
     <l n="125">It thrives in misery , and abundant grows :</l>
     <l n="126">In misery fools upon themselves impose .</l>
     <l n="127">But why before us protestants produce</l>
     <l n="128">An Indian mystic or a French recluse ?</l>
     <l n="129">Their sin is plain ; but what have we to fear ,</l>
     <l n="130">Reform 'd and well-instructed ? You shall hear .</l>
     <l n="131">Yon ancient prude , whose wither 'd features show</l>
     <l n="132">She might be young some forty years ago ,</l>
     <l n="133">Her elbows pinioned close upon her hips ,</l>
     <l n="134">Her head erect , her fan upon her lips ,</l>
     <l n="135">Her eyebrows arched , her eyes both gone astray</l>
     <l n="136">To watch yon amorous couple in their play ,</l>
     <l n="137">With bony and unkerchief 'd neck defies</l>
     <l n="138">The rude inclemency of wintry skies ,</l>

     <l n="141">To thrift and parsimony much inclined ,</l>
     <l n="142">She yet allows herself that boy behind ;</l>
     <l n="143">The shivering urchin , bending as he goes ,</l>
     <l n="144">With slipshod heels and dewdrop at his nose ,</l>
     <l n="145">His predecessor 's coat advanced to wear ,</l>
     <l n="146">Which future pages yet are doom 'd to share ,</l>
     <l n="147">Carries her Bible tuck 'd beneath his arm ,</l>
     <l n="148">And hides his hands to keep his fingers warm .</l>
     <l n="149">She , half an angel in her own account ,</l>
     <l n="150">Doubts not hereafter with the saints to mount ,</l>
     <l n="151">Though not a grace appears on strictest search ,</l>
     <l n="152">But that she fasts , and item , goes to church .</l>
     <l n="153">Conscious of age , she recollects her youth ,</l>
     <l n="154">And tells , not always with an eye to truth ,</l>
     <l n="155">Who spann 'd her waist , and who , where'er he came ,</l>
     <l n="156">Scrawl 'd upon glass Miss Bridget 's lovely name ;</l>

     <l n="159">Of temper as envenom 'd as an asp ,</l>
     <l n="160">Censorious , and her every word a wasp ;</l>

     <l n="163">Laughs at the reputations she has torn ,</l>
     <l n="164">And holds them dangling at arm 's length in scorn .</l>
     <l n="165">Such are the fruits of sanctimonious pride ,</l>
     <l n="166">Of malice fed while flesh is mortified :</l>
     <l n="167">Take , madam , the reward of all your prayers ,</l>

     <l n="175">Is this a saint ? Throw tints and all away —</l>
     <l n="176">True piety is cheerful as the day ,</l>
     <l n="177">Will weep indeed and heave a pitying groan</l>
     <l n="178">For others ’ woes , but smiles upon her own .</l>
     <l n="179">What purpose has the King of saints in view ?</l>
     <l n="180">Why falls the gospel like a gracious dew ?</l>
     <l n="181">To call up plenty from the teeming earth ,</l>
     <l n="182">Or curse the desert with a tenfold dearth ?</l>

     <l n="189">No fear attends to quench his glowing fires ,</l>
     <l n="190">What fear he feels his gratitude inspires .</l>

     <l n="205">Reports a message with a pleasing grace ,</l>
     <l n="206">Expert in all the duties of his place ;</l>
     <l n="207">Say , on what hinge does his obedience move ?</l>
     <l n="208">Has he a world of gratitude and love ?</l>
     <l n="209">No , not a spark — ‘ tis all mere sharper 's play ;</l>
     <l n="210">He likes your house , your housemaid , and your pay ;</l>
     <l n="211">Reduce his wages , or get rid of her ,</l>
     <l n="212">Tom quits you , with — Your most obedient , sir .</l>
     <l n="213">The dinner served , Charles takes his usual stand ,</l>
     <l n="214">Watches your eye , anticipates command ;</l>
     <l n="215">Sighs , if perhaps your appetite should fail ;</l>
     <l n="216">And , if he but suspects a frown , turns pale ;</l>
     <l n="217">Consults all day your interest and your ease ,</l>
     <l n="218">Richly rewarded if he can but please ;</l>
     <l n="219">And , proud to make his firm attachment known ,</l>
     <l n="220">To save your life would nobly risk his own .</l>
     <l n="221">Now which stands highest in your serious thought ?</l>
     <l n="222">Charles , without doubt , say you — and so he ought ;</l>
     <l n="223">One act , that from a thankful heart proceeds ,</l>
     <l n="224">Excels ten thousand mercenary deeds .</l>
     <l n="225">Thus Heaven approves as honest and sincere</l>
     <l n="226">The work of generous love and filial fear ;</l>
     <l n="227">But with averted eyes the omniscient Judge</l>
     <l n="228">Scorns the base hireling and the slavish drudge .</l>

     <l n="232">And , pleased at heart because on holy ground ,</l>
     <l n="233">Sometimes a canting hypocrite is found ,</l>
     <l n="234">Reproach a people with his single fall ,</l>
     <l n="235">And cast his filthy raiment at them all .</l>

     <l n="238">See where it smokes along the sounding plain ,</l>
     <l n="239">Blown all aslant , a driving , dashing rain ,</l>
     <l n="240">Peal upon peal redoubling all around ,</l>
     <l n="241">Shakes it again and faster to the ground ;</l>

     <l n="243">Swift beyond thought the lightnings dart away .</l>
     <l n="244">Ere yet it came the traveller urged his steed ,</l>
     <l n="245">And hurried , but with unsuccessful speed ;</l>
     <l n="246">Now drench 'd throughout , and hopeless of his case ,</l>
     <l n="247">He drops the rein , and leaves him to his pace .</l>
     <l n="248">Suppose , unlook 'd for in a scene so rude ,</l>
     <l n="249">Long hid by interposing hill or wood ,</l>
     <l n="250">Some mansion , neat and elegantly dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="251">By some kind hospitable heart possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="252">Offer him warmth , security , and rest ;</l>
     <l n="253">Think with what pleasure , safe , and at his ease ,</l>
     <l n="254">He hears the tempest howling in the trees ;</l>
     <l n="255">What glowing thanks his lips and heart employ ,</l>
     <l n="256">While danger past is turn 'd to present joy .</l>
     <l n="257">So fares it with the sinner , when he feels</l>
     <l n="258">A growing dread of vengeance at his heels :</l>
     <l n="259">His conscience like a glassy lake before ,</l>
     <l n="260">Lash 'd into foaming waves , begins to roar ;</l>
     <l n="261">The law , grown clamorous , though silent long ,</l>
     <l n="262">Arraigns him , charges him with every wrong —</l>
     <l n="263">Asserts the right of his offended Lord ,</l>
     <l n="264">And death , or restitution , is the word :</l>
     <l n="265">The last impossible , he fears the first ,</l>
     <l n="266">And , having well deserved , expects the worst .</l>
     <l n="267">Then welcome refuge and a peaceful home ;</l>
     <l n="268">Oh for a shelter from the wrath to come !</l>
     <l n="269">Crush me , ye rocks ; ye falling mountains , hide ,</l>
     <l n="270">Or bury me in ocean 's angry tide !—</l>
     <l n="271">The scrutiny of those all-seeing eyes</l>
     <l n="272">I dare not — And you need not , God replies ;</l>
     <l n="273">The remedy you want I freely give ;</l>
     <l n="274">The book shall teach you — read , believe , and live !</l>
     <l n="275">‘ Tis done — the raging storm is heard no more ,</l>
     <l n="276">Mercy receives him on her peaceful shore :</l>
     <l n="277">And Justice , guardian of the dread command ,</l>
     <l n="278">Drops the red vengeance from his willing hand .</l>
     <l n="279">A soul redeem 'd demands a life of praise ;</l>
     <l n="280">Hence the complexion of his future days ,</l>
     <l n="281">Hence a demeanour holy and unspeck 'd ,</l>
     <l n="282">And the world 's hatred , as its sure effect .</l>
     <l n="283">Some lead a life unblameable and just ,</l>
     <l n="284">Their own dear virtue their unshaken trust :</l>
     <l n="285">They never sin — or if ( as all offend )</l>
     <l n="286">Some trivial slips their daily walk attend ,</l>
     <l n="287">The poor are near at hand , the charge is small ,</l>
     <l n="288">A slight gratuity atones for all .</l>
     <l n="289">For though the pope has lost his interest here ,</l>
     <l n="290">And pardons are not sold as once they were ,</l>
     <l n="291">No papist more desirous to compound ,</l>
     <l n="292">Than some grave sinners upon English ground .</l>
     <l n="293">That plea refuted , other quirks they seek —</l>
     <l n="294">Mercy is infinite , and man is weak ;</l>
     <l n="295">The future shall obliterate the past ,</l>
     <l n="296">And heaven , no doubt , shall be their home at last .</l>
     <l n="297">Come , then — a still , small whisper in your ear —</l>
     <l n="298">He has no hope who never had a fear ;</l>
     <l n="299">And he that never doubted of his state ,</l>
     <l n="300">He may perhaps — perhaps he may — too late .</l>
     <l n="301">The path to bliss abounds with many a snare ;</l>
     <l n="302">Learning is one , and wit , however rare .</l>
     <l n="303">The Frenchman , first in literary fame ,</l>
     <l n="304">( Mention him , if you please . Voltaire ?— The same )</l>
     <l n="305">With spirit , genius , eloquence , supplied ,</l>
     <l n="306">Lived long , wrote much , laugh 'd heartily , and died ;</l>
     <l n="307">The Scripture was his jest book , whence he drew</l>
     <l n="308">Bon-mots to gall the Christian and the Jew ;</l>
     <l n="309">An infidel in health , but what when sick ?</l>
     <l n="310">Oh — then a text would touch him at the quick ;</l>
     <l n="311">View him at Paris in his last career ,</l>
     <l n="312">Surrounding throngs the demi-god revere ;</l>
     <l n="313">Exalted on his pedestal of pride ,</l>
     <l n="314">And fumed with frankincense on every side ,</l>
     <l n="315">He begs their flattery with his latest breath ,</l>
     <l n="316">And , smother 'd i n't at last , is praised to death !</l>
     <l n="317">Yon cottager , who weaves at her own door ,</l>
     <l n="318">Pillow and bobbins all her little store ;</l>
     <l n="319">Content though mean , and cheerful if not gay ,</l>
     <l n="320">Shuffling her threads about the live-long day ,</l>
     <l n="321">Just earns a scanty pittance , and at night</l>
     <l n="322">Lies down secure , her heart and pocket light ;</l>
     <l n="323">She , for her humble sphere by nature fit ,</l>
     <l n="324">Has little understanding , and no wit ,</l>
     <l n="325">Receives no praise ; but though her lot be such ,</l>
     <l n="326">( Toilsome and indigent ,) she renders much ;</l>
     <l n="327">Just knows , and knows no more , her Bible true —</l>
     <l n="328">A truth the brilliant Frenchman never knew ;</l>
     <l n="329">And in that charter reads with sparkling eyes ,</l>
     <l n="330">Her title to a treasure in the skies .</l>
     <l n="331">Oh , happy peasant ! Oh , unhappy bard !</l>
     <l n="332">His the mere tinsel , hers the rich reward ;</l>
     <l n="333">He praised perhaps for ages yet to come ,</l>
     <l n="334">She never heard of half a mile from home :</l>
     <l n="335">He , lost in errors , his vain heart prefers ,</l>
     <l n="336">She , safe in the simplicity of hers .</l>
     <l n="337">Not many wise , rich , noble , or profound</l>
     <l n="338">In science win one inch of heavenly ground .</l>
     <l n="339">And is it not a mortifying thought</l>
     <l n="340">The poor should gain it , and the rich should not ?</l>
     <l n="341">No — the voluptuaries , who ne'er forget</l>
     <l n="342">One pleasure lost , lose heaven without regret ;</l>
     <l n="343">Regret would rouse them , and give birth to prayer ,</l>
     <l n="344">Prayer would add faith , and faith would fix them there .</l>
     <l n="345">Not that the Former of us all in this ,</l>
     <l n="346">Or aught he does , is govern 'd by caprice ;</l>
     <l n="347">The supposition is replete with sin ,</l>
     <l n="348">And bears the brand of blasphemy burnt in .</l>
     <l n="349">Not so — the silver trumpet 's heavenly call</l>
     <l n="350">Sounds for the poor , but sounds alike for all :</l>
     <l n="351">Kings are invited , and would kings obey ,</l>
     <l n="352">No slaves on earth more welcome were than they ;</l>
     <l n="353">But royalty , nobility , and state ,</l>
     <l n="354">Are such a dead preponderating weight ,</l>
     <l n="355">That endless bliss , ( how strange soe'er it seem ,)</l>
     <l n="356">In counterpoise , flies up and kicks the beam .</l>
     <l n="357">‘ Tis open , and ye cannot enter — why ?</l>
     <l n="358">Because ye will not , Conyers would reply —</l>
     <l n="359">And he says much that many may dispute</l>
     <l n="360">And cavil at with ease , but none refute .</l>
     <l n="361">Oh , bless 'd effect of penury and want ,</l>
     <l n="362">The seed sown there , how vigorous is the plant !</l>
     <l n="363">No soil like poverty for growth divine ,</l>
     <l n="364">As leanest land supplies the richest wine .</l>
     <l n="365">Earth gives too little , giving only bread ,</l>
     <l n="366">To nourish pride , or turn the weakest head :</l>
     <l n="367">To them the sounding jargon of the schools</l>
     <l n="368">Seems what it is — a cap and bells for fools :</l>
     <l n="369">The light they walk by , kindled from above ,</l>
     <l n="370">Shows them the shortest way to life and love :</l>
     <l n="371">They , strangers to the controversial field ,</l>
     <l n="372">Where deists , always foil 'd , yet scorn to yield ,</l>
     <l n="373">And never check 'd by what impedes the wise ,</l>

     <l n="377">We boast some rich ones whom the Gospel sways ,</l>
     <l n="378">And one who wears a coronet and prays ;</l>
     <l n="379">Like gleanings of an olive tree , they show</l>
     <l n="380">Here and there one upon the topmost bough .</l>
     <l n="381">How readily , upon the Gospel plan ,</l>
     <l n="382">That question has its answer — What is man ?</l>
     <l n="383">Sinful and weak , in every sense a wretch ;</l>
     <l n="384">An instrument , whose chords , upon the stretch ,</l>
     <l n="385">And strain 'd to the last screw that he can bear ,</l>
     <l n="386">Yield only discord in his Maker 's ear :</l>
     <l n="387">Once the blest residence of truth divine ,</l>
     <l n="388">Glorious as Solyma 's interior shrine ,</l>
     <l n="389">Where , in his own oracular abode ,</l>
     <l n="390">Dwelt visibly the light-creating God ;</l>
     <l n="391">But made long since , like Babylon of old ,</l>
     <l n="392">A den of mischiefs never to be told :</l>
     <l n="393">And she , once mistress of the realms around ,</l>
     <l n="394">Now scattered wide and no where to be found ,</l>
     <l n="395">As soon shall rise and re-ascend the throne ,</l>
     <l n="396">By native power and energy her own ,</l>
     <l n="397">As nature , at her own peculiar cost ,</l>
     <l n="398">Restore to man the glories he has lost .</l>
     <l n="399">Go — bid the winter cease to chill the year ,</l>
     <l n="400">Replace the wandering comet in his sphere ,</l>
     <l n="401">Then boast ( but wait for that unhoped for hour )</l>
     <l n="402">The self-restoring arm of human power .</l>
     <l n="403">But what is man in his own proud esteem ?</l>
     <l n="404">Hear him — himself the poet and the theme :</l>
     <l n="405">A monarch clothed with majesty and awe ,</l>
     <l n="406">His mind his kingdom , and his will his law ;</l>
     <l n="407">Grace in his mien , and glory in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="408">Supreme on earth , and worthy of the skies ,</l>
     <l n="409">Strength in his heart , dominion in his nod ,</l>
     <l n="410">And , thunderbolts excepted , quite a God !</l>
     <l n="411">So sings he , charm 'd with his own mind and form ,</l>
     <l n="412">The song magnificent — the theme a worm !</l>
     <l n="413">Himself so much the source of his delight ,</l>
     <l n="414">His Maker has no beauty in his sight .</l>
     <l n="415">See where he sits , contemplative and fix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="416">Pleasure and wonder in his features mix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="417">His passions tamed and all at his control ,</l>
     <l n="418">How perfect the composure of his soul !</l>
     <l n="419">Complacency has breathed a gentle gale</l>
     <l n="420">O'er all his thoughts , and swell 'd his easy sail :</l>
     <l n="421">His books well trimm 'd , and in the gayest style ,</l>
     <l n="422">Like regimental coxcombs , rank and file ,</l>
     <l n="423">Adorn his intellects as well as shelves ,</l>
     <l n="424">And teach him notions splendid as themselves :</l>
     <l n="425">The Bible only stands neglected there ,</l>
     <l n="426">Though that of all most worthy of his care ;</l>
     <l n="427">And , like an infant troublesome awake ,</l>
     <l n="428">Is left to sleep for peace and quiet sake .</l>
     <l n="429">What shall the man deserve of human kind ,</l>
     <l n="430">Whose happy skill and industry combined</l>
     <l n="431">Shall prove ( what argument could never yet )</l>
     <l n="432">The Bible an imposture and a cheat ?</l>
     <l n="433">The praises of the libertine profess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="434">The worst of men , and curses of the best .</l>
     <l n="435">Where should the living , weeping o'er his woes ;</l>
     <l n="436">The dying , trembling at the awful close ;</l>
     <l n="437">Where the betray 'd , forsaken , and oppress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="438">The thousands whom the world forbids to rest ;</l>
     <l n="439">Where should they find , ( those comforts at an end ,</l>
     <l n="440">The Scripture yields ,) or hope to find , a friend ?</l>
     <l n="441">Sorrow might muse herself to madness then ,</l>
     <l n="442">And , seeking exile from the sight of men ,</l>
     <l n="443">Bury herself in solitude profound ,</l>
     <l n="444">Grow frantic with her pangs , and bite the ground .</l>
     <l n="445">Thus often Unbelief , grown sick of life ,</l>
     <l n="446">Flies to the tempting pool , or felon knife .</l>
     <l n="447">The jury meet , the coroner is short ,</l>
     <l n="448">And lunacy the verdict of the court .</l>
     <l n="449">Reverse the sentence , let the truth be known ,</l>
     <l n="450">Such lunacy is ignorance alone ;</l>
     <l n="451">They knew not , what some bishops may not know ,</l>
     <l n="452">That Scripture is the only cure of woe .</l>
     <l n="453">That field of promise how it flings abroad</l>
     <l n="454">Its odour o'er the Christian 's thorny road !</l>
     <l n="455">The soul , reposing on assured relief ,</l>
     <l n="456">Feels herself happy amidst all her grief ,</l>
     <l n="457">Forgets her labour as she toils along ,</l>
     <l n="458">Weeps tears of joy , and bursts into a song .</l>
     <l n="459">But the same word , that , like the polish 'd share ,</l>
     <l n="460">Ploughs up the roots of a believer 's care ,</l>
     <l n="461">Kills too the flowery weeds , where'er they grow ,</l>
     <l n="462">That bind the sinner 's Bacchanalian brow .</l>
     <l n="463">Oh , that unwelcome voice of heavenly love ,</l>
     <l n="464">Sad messenger of mercy from above !</l>
     <l n="465">How does it grate upon his thankless ear ,</l>
     <l n="466">Crippling his pleasures with the cramp of fear !</l>
     <l n="467">His will and judgment at continual strife ,</l>
     <l n="468">That civil war embitters all his life ;</l>
     <l n="469">In vain he points his powers against the skies ,</l>
     <l n="470">In vain he closes or averts his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="471">Truth will intrude — she bids him yet beware ;</l>
     <l n="472">And shakes the sceptic in the scorner 's chair .</l>
     <l n="473">Though various foes against the Truth combine ,</l>
     <l n="474">Pride above all opposes her design ;</l>
     <l n="475">Pride , of a growth superior to the rest ,</l>
     <l n="476">The subtlest serpent with the loftiest crest ,</l>
     <l n="477">Swells at the thought , and , kindling into rage ,</l>
     <l n="478">Would hiss the cherub Mercy from the stage .</l>
     <l n="479">And is the soul indeed so lost ?— she cries ,</l>
     <l n="480">Fallen from her glory , and too weak to rise ?</l>
     <l n="481">Torpid and dull , beneath a frozen zone ,</l>
     <l n="482">Has she no spark that may be deem 'd her own ?</l>
     <l n="483">Grant her indebted to what zealots call</l>
     <l n="484">Grace undeserved , yet surely not for all !</l>
     <l n="485">Some beams of rectitude she yet displays ,</l>
     <l n="486">Some love of virtue , and some power to praise ;</l>
     <l n="487">Can lift herself above corporeal things ,</l>
     <l n="488">And , soaring on her own unborrow 'd wings ,</l>
     <l n="489">Possess herself of all that 's good or true ,</l>
     <l n="490">Assert the skies , and vindicate her due .</l>
     <l n="491">Past indiscretion is a venial crime ;</l>
     <l n="492">And if the youth , unmellowed yet by time ,</l>
     <l n="493">Bore on his branch , luxuriant then and rude ,</l>
     <l n="494">Fruits of a blighted size , austere and crude ,</l>
     <l n="495">Maturer years shall happier stores produce ,</l>
     <l n="496">And meliorate the well-concocted juice .</l>
     <l n="497">Then , conscious of her meritorious zeal ,</l>
     <l n="498">To Justice she may make her bold appeal ;</l>
     <l n="499">And leave to Mercy , with a tranquil mind ,</l>
     <l n="500">The worthless and unfruitful of mankind .</l>
     <l n="501">Hear then how Mercy , slighted and defied ,</l>
     <l n="502">Retorts the affront against the crown of pride .</l>
     <l n="503">Perish the virtue , as it ought , abhorr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="504">And the fool with it , who insults his Lord .</l>
     <l n="505">The atonement a Redeemer 's love has wrought</l>
     <l n="506">Is not for you — the righteous need it not .</l>
     <l n="507">Seest thou yon harlot , wooing all she meets ,</l>
     <l n="508">The worn-out nuisance of the public streets ,</l>
     <l n="509">Herself from morn to night , from night to morn ,</l>
     <l n="510">Her own abhorrence , and as much your scorn ?</l>
     <l n="511">The gracious shower , unlimited and free ,</l>
     <l n="512">Shall fall on her , when Heaven denies it thee .</l>
     <l n="513">Of all that wisdom dictates , this the drift —</l>
     <l n="514">That man is dead in sin , and life a gift .</l>
     <l n="515">Is virtue , then , unless of Christian growth ,</l>
     <l n="516">Mere fallacy , or foolishness , or both ?</l>
     <l n="517">Ten thousand sages lost in endless woe ,</l>
     <l n="518">For ignorance of what they could not know ?—</l>
     <l n="519">That speech betrays at once a bigot 's tongue ,</l>
     <l n="520">Charge not a God with such outrageous wrong !</l>
     <l n="521">Truly , not I — the partial light men have ,</l>
     <l n="522">My creed persuades me , well employ 'd , may save ;</l>
     <l n="523">While he that scorns the noon-day beam , perverse ,</l>
     <l n="524">Shall find the blessing , unimproved , a curse .</l>
     <l n="525">Let heathen worthies , whose exalted mind</l>
     <l n="526">Left sensuality and dross behind ,</l>
     <l n="527">Possess , for me , their undisputed lot ,</l>
     <l n="528">And take , unenvied , the reward they sought .</l>
     <l n="529">But still in virtue of a Saviour 's plea ,</l>
     <l n="530">Not blind by choice , but destined not to see .</l>
     <l n="531">Their fortitude and wisdom were a flame</l>
     <l n="532">Celestial , though they knew not whence it came ,</l>
     <l n="533">Derived from the same source of light and grace ,</l>
     <l n="534">That guides the Christian in his swifter race ;</l>
     <l n="535">Their judge was conscience , and her rule their law :</l>
     <l n="536">That rule , pursued with reverence and with awe ,</l>
     <l n="537">Led them , however faltering , faint , and slow ,</l>
     <l n="538">From what they knew to what they wish 'd to know .</l>
     <l n="539">But let not him that shares a brighter day</l>
     <l n="540">Traduce the splendour of a noontide ray ,</l>
     <l n="541">Prefer the twilight of a darker time ,</l>
     <l n="542">And deem his base stupidity no crime ;</l>
     <l n="543">The wretch , who slights the bounty of the skies ,</l>
     <l n="544">And sinks , while favour 'd with the means to rise ,</l>
     <l n="545">Shall find them rated at their full amount ,</l>
     <l n="546">The good he scorn 'd all carried to account .</l>
     <l n="547">Marshalling all his terrors as he came ,</l>
     <l n="548">Thunder , and earthquake , and devouring flame ,</l>
     <l n="549">From Sinai 's top Jehovah gave the law —</l>
     <l n="550">Life for obedience — death for every flaw .</l>
     <l n="551">When the great Sovereign would his will express ,</l>
     <l n="552">He gives a perfect rule , what can he less ?</l>
     <l n="553">And guards it with a sanction as severe</l>
     <l n="554">As vengeance can inflict , or sinners fear :</l>
     <l n="555">Else his own glorious rights he would disclaim ,</l>
     <l n="556">And man might safely trifle with his name .</l>
     <l n="557">He bids him glow with unremitting love</l>
     <l n="558">To all on earth , and to himself above ;</l>
     <l n="559">Condemns the injurious deed , the slanderous tongue ,</l>
     <l n="560">The thought that meditates a brother 's wrong :</l>
     <l n="561">Brings not alone the more conspicuous part ,</l>
     <l n="562">His conduct , to the test , but tries his heart .</l>
     <l n="563">Hark ! universal nature shook and groan 'd ,</l>
     <l n="564">‘ Twas the last trumpet — see the Judge enthroned :</l>
     <l n="565">Rouse all your courage at your utmost need ,</l>
     <l n="566">Now summon every virtue , stand and plead .</l>
     <l n="567">What ! silent ? Is your boasting heard no more ?</l>
     <l n="568">That self-renouncing wisdom , learn 'd before ,</l>
     <l n="569">Had shed immortal glories on your brow ,</l>
     <l n="570">That all your virtues cannot purchase now .</l>
     <l n="571">All joy to the believer ! He can speak —</l>
     <l n="572">Trembling yet happy , confident yet meek .</l>
     <l n="573">Since the dear hour that brought me to thy foot</l>
     <l n="574">And cut up all my follies by the root ,</l>
     <l n="575">I never trusted in an arm but thine ,</l>
     <l n="576">Nor hoped , but in thy righteousness divine :</l>
     <l n="577">My prayers and alms , imperfect and defiled ,</l>
     <l n="578">Were but the feeble efforts of a child ;</l>
     <l n="579">Howe'er performed , it was their brightest part ,</l>
     <l n="580">That they proceeded from a grateful heart :</l>
     <l n="581">Cleansed in thine own all-purifying blood ,</l>
     <l n="582">Forgive their evil and accept their good :</l>
     <l n="583">I cast them at thy feet — my only plea</l>
     <l n="584">Is what it was , dependence upon thee :</l>
     <l n="585">While struggling in the vale of tears below ,</l>
     <l n="586">That never fail 'd , nor shall it fail me now .</l>
     <l n="587">Angelic gratulations rend the skies ,</l>
     <l n="588">Pride falls unpitied , never more to rise ,</l>
     <l n="589">Humility is crown 'd , and Faith receives the prize .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Expostulation with the Muse weeping for England — Her apparently prosperous condition — State of Israel when the prophet wept over it — The Babylonian Captivity — When nations decline , the evil commences in the Church — State of the Jews in the time of our Saviour — Evidences of their having been the most favoured of nations — Causes of their downfall — Lesson taught by it — Warning to Britain — The hand of Providence to be traced in adverse events — England 's transgressions — Her vain-glory — Her conduct towards India — Abuse of the sacrament — Obduracy against repentance — Futility of fasts — Character of the Clergy — The poet adverts to the state of the ancient Britons — Beneficial influence of the Roman power — England under papal supremacy — Favours since bestowed on her by Providence — Reasons for gratitude to God and for seeking to secure his favour — With that she may defy a world in arms — The poet anticipates little effect from his warning .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Why weeps the muse for England ? What appears</l>
     <l n="2">In England 's case to move the muse to tears ?</l>
     <l n="3">From side to side of her delightful isle</l>
     <l n="4">Is she not clothed with a perpetual smile ?</l>
     <l n="5">Can Nature add a charm , or Art confer</l>
     <l n="6">A new-found luxury , not seen in her ?</l>
     <l n="7">Where under heaven is pleasure more pursued ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or where does cold reflection less intrude ?</l>
     <l n="9">Her fields a rich expanse of wavy corn ,</l>
     <l n="10">Pour 'd out from Plenty 's overflowing horn ;</l>
     <l n="11">Ambrosial gardens , in which art supplies</l>
     <l n="12">The fervour and the force of Indian skies ;</l>
     <l n="13">Her peaceful shores , where busy Commerce waits</l>
     <l n="14">To pour his golden tide through all her gates ;</l>
     <l n="15">Whom fiery suns , that scorch the russet spice</l>
     <l n="16">Of eastern groves , and oceans floor 'd with ice ,</l>
     <l n="17">Forbid in vain to push his daring way</l>
     <l n="18">To darker climes , or climes of brighter day ;</l>
     <l n="19">Whom the winds waft where'er the billows roll ,</l>
     <l n="20">From the World 's girdle to the frozen pole ;</l>
     <l n="21">The chariots bounding in her wheel-worn streets ,</l>
     <l n="22">Her vaults below , where every vintage meets ;</l>
     <l n="23">Her theatres , her revels , and her sports ;</l>
     <l n="24">The scenes to which not youth alone resorts ,</l>
     <l n="25">But age , in spite of weakness and of pain ,</l>
     <l n="26">Still haunts , in hope to dream of youth again ;</l>
     <l n="27">All speak her happy : let the muse look round</l>
     <l n="28">From East to West , no sorrow can be found ;</l>
     <l n="29">Or only what , in cottages confined ,</l>
     <l n="30">Sighs unregarded to the passing wind .</l>
     <l n="31">Then wherefore weep for England ? What appears</l>
     <l n="32">In England 's case to move the muse to tears ?</l>
     <l n="33">The prophet wept for Israel ; wish 'd his eyes</l>
     <l n="34">Were fountains fed with infinite supplies ;</l>
     <l n="35">For Israel dealt in robbery and wrong ;</l>
     <l n="36">There were the scorner 's and the slanderer 's tongue ;</l>
     <l n="37">Oaths , used as playthings or convenient tools ,</l>
     <l n="38">As interest biass 'd knaves , or fashion fools ;</l>
     <l n="39">Adultery , neighing at his neighbour 's door ;</l>
     <l n="40">Oppression labouring hard to grind the poor ;</l>
     <l n="41">The partial balance and deceitful weight ;</l>
     <l n="42">The treacherous smile , a mask for secret hate ;</l>
     <l n="43">Hypocrisy , formality in prayer ,</l>
     <l n="44">And the dull service of the lip were there .</l>
     <l n="45">Her women , insolent and self-caress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">By Vanity 's unwearied finger dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="47">Forgot the blush that virgin fears impart</l>
     <l n="48">To modest cheeks , and borrow 'd one from art ;</l>
     <l n="49">Were just such trifles , without worth or use ,</l>
     <l n="50">As silly pride and idleness produce ;</l>
     <l n="51">Curl 'd , scented , furbelow 'd , and flounced around ,</l>
     <l n="52">With feet too delicate to touch the ground ,</l>
     <l n="53">They stretch 'd the neck , and roll 'd the wanton eye ,</l>
     <l n="54">And sigh 'd for every fool that flutter 'd by .</l>
     <l n="55">He saw his people slaves to every lust ,</l>
     <l n="56">Lewd , avaricious , arrogant , unjust ;</l>
     <l n="57">He heard the wheels of an avenging God</l>
     <l n="58">Groan heavily along the distant road ;</l>
     <l n="59">Saw Babylon set wide her two-leaved brass</l>
     <l n="60">To let the military deluge pass ;</l>
     <l n="61">Jerusalem a prey , her glory soil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="62">Her princes captive , and her treasures spoil 'd ;</l>
     <l n="63">Wept till all Israel heard his bitter cry ,</l>
     <l n="64">Stamp 'd with his foot , and smote upon his thigh ;</l>
     <l n="65">But wept , and stamp 'd , and smote his thigh in vain ,</l>
     <l n="66">Pleasure is deaf when told of future pain ,</l>
     <l n="67">And sounds prophetic are too rough to suit</l>
     <l n="68">Ears long accustom 'd to the pleasing lute :</l>
     <l n="69">They scorn 'd his inspiration and his theme ,</l>
     <l n="70">Pronounc 'd him frantic , and his fears a dream ;</l>
     <l n="71">With self-indulgence wing 'd the fleeting hours ,</l>
     <l n="72">Till the foe found them , and down fell the towers .</l>
     <l n="73">Long time Assyria bound them in her chain ,</l>
     <l n="74">Till penitence had purged the public stain ,</l>
     <l n="75">And Cyrus , with relenting pity moved ,</l>
     <l n="76">Return 'd them happy to the land they loved ;</l>
     <l n="77">There , proof against prosperity , awhile</l>
     <l n="78">They stood the test of her ensnaring smile ,</l>
     <l n="79">And had the grace in scenes of peace to show</l>
     <l n="80">The virtue they had learn 'd in scenes of woe .</l>
     <l n="81">But man is frail , and can but ill sustain</l>
     <l n="82">A long immunity from grief and pain ;</l>
     <l n="83">And , after all the joys that Plenty leads ,</l>
     <l n="84">With tiptoe step Vice silently succeeds .</l>
     <l n="85">When he that ruled them with a shepherd 's rod ,</l>
     <l n="86">In form a man , in dignity a God ,</l>
     <l n="87">Came , not expected in that humble guise ,</l>
     <l n="88">To sift and search them with unerring eyes ,</l>
     <l n="89">He found , conceal 'd beneath a fair outside ,</l>
     <l n="90">The filth of rottenness and worm of pride ;</l>
     <l n="91">Their piety a system of deceit ,</l>
     <l n="92">Scripture employ 'd to sanctify the cheat ;</l>
     <l n="93">The Pharisee the dupe of his own art ,</l>
     <l n="94">Self-idolized , and yet a knave at heart .</l>
     <l n="95">When nations are to perish in their sins ,</l>
     <l n="96">‘ Tis in the church the leprosy begins ;</l>
     <l n="97">The priest , whose office is , with zeal sincere ,</l>
     <l n="98">To watch the fountain and preserve it clear ,</l>
     <l n="99">Carelessly nods and sleeps upon the brink ,</l>
     <l n="100">While others poison what the flock must drink ;</l>
     <l n="101">Or , waking at the call of lust alone ,</l>
     <l n="102">Infuses lies and errors of his own :</l>
     <l n="103">His unsuspecting sheep believe it pure ;</l>
     <l n="104">And , tainted by the very means of cure ,</l>
     <l n="105">Catch from each other a contagious spot ,</l>
     <l n="106">The foul forerunner of a general rot .</l>
     <l n="107">Then truth is hush 'd , that Heresy may preach ;</l>
     <l n="108">And all is trash that reason cannot reach ;</l>
     <l n="109">Then God 's own image on the soul impress 'd</l>
     <l n="110">Becomes a mockery and a standing jest ;</l>
     <l n="111">And faith , the root whence only can arise</l>
     <l n="112">The graces of a life that wins the skies ,</l>
     <l n="113">Loses at once all value and esteem ,</l>
     <l n="114">Pronounced by graybeards a pernicious dream :</l>
     <l n="115">Then Ceremony leads her bigots forth ,</l>
     <l n="116">Prepared to fight for shadows of no worth ;</l>
     <l n="117">While truths , on which eternal things depend ,</l>
     <l n="118">Find not , or hardly find , a single friend :</l>
     <l n="119">As soldiers watch the signal of command ,</l>
     <l n="120">They learn to bow , to kneel , to sit , to stand ;</l>
     <l n="121">Happy to fill religion 's vacant place ;</l>
     <l n="122">With hollow form , and gesture , and grimace .</l>
     <l n="123">Such , when the Teacher of his church was there ,</l>
     <l n="124">People and priest , the sons of Israel were ;</l>
     <l n="125">Stiff in the letter , lax in the design</l>
     <l n="126">And import of their oracles divine ;</l>
     <l n="127">Their learning legendary , false , absurd ,</l>
     <l n="128">And yet exalted above God 's own word ;</l>
     <l n="129">They drew a curse from an intended good ,</l>
     <l n="130">Puff 'd up with gifts they never understood .</l>
     <l n="131">He judged them with as terrible a frown ,</l>
     <l n="132">As if not love , but wrath , had brought him down :</l>

     <l n="322">The busy trifler dreams himself alone ,</l>
     <l n="323">Frames many a purpose , and God works his own .</l>

     <l n="328">In just resentment of his injured laws ,</l>
     <l n="329">He pours contempt on them and on their cause ;</l>

     <l n="339">And hell 's close mischief naked in his sight .</l>
     <l n="340">Stand now and judge thyself — Hast thou incurr 'd</l>
     <l n="341">His anger who can waste thee with a word ,</l>
     <l n="342">Who poises and proportions sea and land ,</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Human Life — The charms of Nature remain the same though they appear different in youth and age — Frivolity of fashionable life — Value of life — The works of the Creator evidences of his attributes — Nature the handmaid to the purposes of grace — Character of Hope — Man naturally stubborn and intractable — His conduct in different stations — Death 's honours — Each man 's belief right in his own eyes — Simile of Ethelred 's hospitality — Mankind quarrel with the Giver of eternal life , on account of the terms on which it is offered — Opinions on this subject — Spread of the Gospel — The Greenland Missions — Contrast of the unconverted and converted heathen — Character of Leuconomus — The man of pleasure the blindest of bigots — Any hope preferred to that required by the Scripture — Human nature opposed to Truth — Apostrophe to Truth — Picture of one conscience-smitten — The pardoned sinner — Conclusion .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Ask what is human life — the sage replies ,</l>
     <l n="2">With disappointment lowering in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="3">A painful passage o'er a restless flood ,</l>
     <l n="4">A vain pursuit of fugitive false good ,</l>
     <l n="5">A scene of fancied bliss and heartfelt care ,</l>
     <l n="6">Closing at last in darkness and despair .</l>
     <l n="7">The poor , inured to drudgery and distress ,</l>
     <l n="8">Act without aim , think little , and feel less ,</l>
     <l n="9">And no where , but in feign 'd Arcadian scenes ,</l>
     <l n="10">Taste happiness , or know what pleasure means .</l>
     <l n="11">Riches are pass 'd away from hand to hand ,</l>
     <l n="12">As fortune , vice , or folly may command ;</l>
     <l n="13">As in a dance the pair that take the lead</l>
     <l n="14">Turn downward , and the lowest pair succeed ,</l>
     <l n="15">So shifting and so various is the plan</l>
     <l n="16">By which Heaven rules the mix 'd affairs of man ;</l>
     <l n="17">Vicissitude wheels round the motley crowd ,</l>
     <l n="18">The rich grow poor , the poor become purse-proud ;</l>
     <l n="19">Business is labour , and man 's weakness such ,</l>
     <l n="20">Pleasure is labour too , and tires as much ,</l>
     <l n="21">The very sense of it foregoes its use ,</l>
     <l n="22">By repetition pall 'd , by age obtuse .</l>
     <l n="23">Youth lost in dissipation , we deplore ,</l>
     <l n="24">Through life 's sad remnant , what no sighs restore ;</l>
     <l n="25">Our years , a fruitless race without a prize ,</l>
     <l n="26">Too many , yet too few to make us wise .</l>
     <l n="27">Dangling his cane about , and taking snuff ,</l>
     <l n="28">Lothario cries , What philosophic stuff —</l>
     <l n="29">O querulous and weak !— whose useless brain</l>
     <l n="30">Once thought of nothing , and now thinks in vain ;</l>
     <l n="31">Whose eye reverted weeps o'er all the past ,</l>
     <l n="32">Whose prospect shows thee a disheartening waste ;</l>
     <l n="33">Would age in thee resign his wint'ry reign ,</l>
     <l n="34">And youth invigorate that frame again ,</l>
     <l n="35">Renew 'd desire would grace with other speech</l>
     <l n="36">Joys always prized , when placed within our reach .</l>
     <l n="37">For lift thy palsied head , shake off the gloom</l>
     <l n="38">That overhangs the borders of thy tomb ,</l>
     <l n="39">See nature gay , as when she first began</l>
     <l n="40">With smiles alluring her admirer man ;</l>
     <l n="41">She spreads the morning over eastern hills ,</l>
     <l n="42">Earth glitters with the drops the night distils ;</l>
     <l n="43">The sun , obedient , at her call appears</l>
     <l n="44">To fling his glories o'er the robe she wears ;</l>
     <l n="45">Banks clothed with flowers , groves fill 'd with sprightly sounds ,</l>
     <l n="46">The yellow tilth , green meads , rocks , rising grounds ,</l>
     <l n="47">Streams , edged with osiers , fattening every field</l>
     <l n="48">Where'er they flow , now seen and now conceal 'd ;</l>
     <l n="49">From the blue rim , where skies and mountains meet ,</l>
     <l n="50">Down to the very turf beneath thy feet ,</l>
     <l n="51">Ten thousand charms , that only fools despise ,</l>
     <l n="52">Or pride can look at with indifferent eyes ,</l>
     <l n="53">All speak one language , all with one sweet voice</l>
     <l n="54">Cry to her universal realm , Rejoice !</l>
     <l n="55">Man feels the spur of passions and desires ,</l>
     <l n="56">And she gives largely more than he requires ;</l>
     <l n="57">Not that , his hours devoted all to care ,</l>
     <l n="58">Hollow-eyed abstinence , and lean despair ,</l>
     <l n="59">The wretch may pine , while to his smell , taste , sight ,</l>
     <l n="60">She holds a paradise of rich delight ;</l>
     <l n="61">But gently to rebuke his awkward fear ,</l>
     <l n="62">To prove that what she gives she gives sincere ,</l>
     <l n="63">To banish hesitation , and proclaim</l>
     <l n="64">His happiness her dear , her only , aim .</l>
     <l n="65">‘ Tis grave philosophy 's absurdest dream ,</l>
     <l n="66">That Heaven 's intentions are not what they seem ,</l>
     <l n="67">That only shadows are dispensed below ,</l>
     <l n="68">And earth has no reality but woe .</l>
     <l n="69">Thus things terrestrial wear a different hue ,</l>
     <l n="70">As youth or age persuades ; and neither true .</l>
     <l n="71">So , Flora 's wreath through colour 'd crystal seen ,</l>
     <l n="72">The rose or lily appears blue or green ,</l>
     <l n="73">But still the imputed tints are those alone</l>
     <l n="74">The medium represents , and not their own .</l>
     <l n="75">To rise at noon , sit slipshod and undress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="76">To read the news , or fiddle , as seems best ,</l>
     <l n="77">Till half the world comes rattling at his door ,</l>
     <l n="78">To fill the dull vacuity till four ;</l>
     <l n="79">And , just when evening turns the blue vault gray ,</l>
     <l n="80">To spend two hours in dressing for the day ;</l>
     <l n="81">To make the sun a bauble without use ,</l>
     <l n="82">Save for the fruits his heavenly beams produce ;</l>
     <l n="83">Quite to forget , or deem it worth no thought ,</l>
     <l n="84">Who bids him shine , or if he shine or not ;</l>
     <l n="85">Through mere necessity to close his eyes</l>
     <l n="86">Just when the larks and when the shepherds rise ;</l>
     <l n="87">Is such a life , so tediously the same ,</l>
     <l n="88">So void of all utility or aim ,</l>
     <l n="89">That poor Jonquil , with almost every breath ,</l>
     <l n="90">Sighs for his exit , vulgarly called death :</l>
     <l n="91">For he , with all his follies , has a mind</l>
     <l n="92">Not yet so blank , or fashionably blind ,</l>
     <l n="93">But now and then perhaps a feeble ray</l>
     <l n="94">Of distant wisdom shoots across his way ;</l>
     <l n="95">By which he reads , that life without a plan ,</l>
     <l n="96">As useless as the moment it began ,</l>
     <l n="97">Serves merely as a soil for discontent</l>
     <l n="98">To thrive in ; an incumbrance ere half spent .</l>
     <l n="99">Oh ! weariness beyond what asses feel ,</l>
     <l n="100">That tread the circuit of the cistern wheel ;</l>
     <l n="101">A dull rotation , never at a stay ,</l>
     <l n="102">Yesterday 's face twin image of to-day ;</l>
     <l n="103">While conversation , an exhausted stock ,</l>
     <l n="104">Grows drowsy as the clicking of a clock .</l>
     <l n="105">No need , he cries , of gravity stuff 'd out</l>
     <l n="106">With academic dignity devout ,</l>
     <l n="107">To read wise lectures , vanity the text :</l>
     <l n="108">Proclaim the remedy , ye learned , next ;</l>
     <l n="109">For truth self-evident , with pomp impress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="110">Is vanity surpassing all the rest .</l>
     <l n="111">That remedy , not hid in deeps profound ,</l>
     <l n="112">Yet seldom sought where only to be found ,</l>
     <l n="113">While passion turns aside from its due scope</l>
     <l n="114">The inquirer 's aim , that remedy is Hope .</l>
     <l n="115">Life is his gift , from whom whate'er life needs ,</l>
     <l n="116">With every good and perfect gift , proceeds ;</l>
     <l n="117">Bestow 'd on man , like all that we partake ,</l>
     <l n="118">Royally , freely , for his bounty 's sake ;</l>
     <l n="119">Transient indeed , as is the fleeting hour ,</l>
     <l n="120">And yet the seed of an immortal flower ;</l>
     <l n="121">Design 'd , in honour of his endless love ,</l>
     <l n="122">To fill with fragrance his abode above ;</l>
     <l n="123">No trifle , howsoever short it seem ,</l>
     <l n="124">And , howsoever shadowy , no dream ;</l>
     <l n="125">Its value , what no thought can ascertain ,</l>
     <l n="126">Nor all an angel 's eloquence explain .</l>
     <l n="127">Men deal with life as children with their play ,</l>
     <l n="128">Who first misuse , then cast their toys away ;</l>
     <l n="129">Live to no sober purpose , and contend</l>
     <l n="130">That their Creator had no serious end .</l>
     <l n="131">When God and man stand opposite in view ,</l>
     <l n="132">Man 's disappointment must , of course , ensue .</l>
     <l n="133">The just Creator condescends to write ,</l>
     <l n="134">In beams of inextinguishable light ,</l>
     <l n="135">His names of wisdom , goodness , power , and love ,</l>
     <l n="136">On all that blooms below , or shines above ;</l>
     <l n="137">To catch the wandering notice of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="138">And teach the world , if not perversely blind ,</l>
     <l n="139">His gracious attributes , and prove the share</l>
     <l n="140">His offspring hold in his paternal care .</l>
     <l n="141">If , led from earthly things to things divine ,</l>
     <l n="142">His creature thwart not his august design ,</l>
     <l n="143">Then praise is heard instead of reasoning pride ,</l>
     <l n="144">And captious cavil and complaint subside .</l>
     <l n="145">Nature , employ 'd in her allotted place ,</l>
     <l n="146">Is handmaid to the purposes of grace ;</l>
     <l n="147">By good vouchsafed makes known superior good ,</l>
     <l n="148">And bliss not seen by blessings understood :</l>
     <l n="149">That bliss , reveal 'd in scripture , with a glow</l>
     <l n="150">Bright as the covenant-ensuring bow ,</l>
     <l n="151">Fires all his feelings with a noble scorn</l>
     <l n="152">Of sensual evil , and thus Hope is born .</l>
     <l n="153">Hope sets the stamp of vanity on all</l>
     <l n="154">That men have deem 'd substantial since the fall ,</l>
     <l n="155">Yet has the wondrous virtue to educe</l>
     <l n="156">From emptiness itself a real use ;</l>
     <l n="157">And while she takes , as at a father 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="158">What health and sober appetite demand ,</l>
     <l n="159">From fading good derives , with chemic art ,</l>
     <l n="160">That lasting happiness , a thankful heart .</l>
     <l n="161">Hope , with uplifted foot , set free from earth ,</l>
     <l n="162">Pants for the place of her ethereal birth ,</l>
     <l n="163">On steady wings sails through the immense abyss ,</l>
     <l n="164">Plucks amaranthine joys from bowers of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="165">And crowns the soul , while yet a mourner here ,</l>
     <l n="166">With wreaths like those triumphant spirits wear .</l>
     <l n="167">Hope , as an anchor , firm and sure , holds fast</l>
     <l n="168">The Christian vessel , and defies the blast .</l>
     <l n="169">Hope ! nothing else can nourish and secure</l>
     <l n="170">His new-born virtues , and preserve him pure .</l>
     <l n="171">Hope ! let the wretch , once conscious of the joy ,</l>
     <l n="172">Whom now despairing agonies destroy ,</l>
     <l n="173">Speak , for he can , and none so well as he ,</l>
     <l n="174">What treasures centre , what delights , in thee .</l>
     <l n="175">Had he the gems , the spices , and the land ,</l>
     <l n="176">That boasts the treasure , all at his command ;</l>
     <l n="177">The fragrant grove , the inestimable mine ,</l>
     <l n="178">Were light , when weigh 'd against one smile of thine .</l>
     <l n="179">Though clasp 'd and cradled in his nurse 's arms ,</l>
     <l n="180">He shines with all a cherub 's artless charms ,</l>
     <l n="181">Man is the genuine offspring of revolt ,</l>
     <l n="182">Stubborn and sturdy , a wild ass 's colt ;</l>
     <l n="183">His passions , like the watery stores that sleep</l>
     <l n="184">Beneath the smiling surface of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="185">Wait but the lashes of a wintry storm ,</l>
     <l n="186">To frown and roar , and shake his feeble form .</l>
     <l n="187">From infancy through childhood 's giddy maze ,</l>
     <l n="188">Froward at school , and fretful in his plays ,</l>
     <l n="189">The puny tyrant burns to subjugate</l>
     <l n="190">The free republic of the whip-gig state .</l>
     <l n="191">If one , his equal in athletic frame ,</l>
     <l n="192">Or , more provoking still , of nobler name ,</l>
     <l n="193">Dare step across his arbitrary views ,</l>
     <l n="194">An Iliad , only not in verse , ensues :</l>
     <l n="195">The little Greeks look trembling at the scales ,</l>
     <l n="196">Till the best tongue or heaviest hand prevails .</l>
     <l n="197">Now see him launch 'd into the world at large ;</l>
     <l n="198">If priest , supinely droning o'er his charge ,</l>
     <l n="199">Their fleece his pillow , and his weekly drawl ,</l>
     <l n="200">Though short , too long , the price he pays for all .</l>
     <l n="201">If lawyer , loud whatever cause he plead ,</l>
     <l n="202">But proudest of the worst , if that succeed .</l>
     <l n="203">Perhaps a grave physician , gathering fees ,</l>
     <l n="204">Punctually paid for lengthening out disease ;</l>
     <l n="205">No COTTON , whose humanity sheds rays ,</l>
     <l n="206">That make superior skill his second praise .</l>
     <l n="207">If arms engage him , he devotes to sport</l>
     <l n="208">His date of life so likely to be short ;</l>
     <l n="209">A soldier may be any thing , if brave ,</l>
     <l n="210">So may a tradesman , if not quite a knave .</l>
     <l n="211">Such stuff the world is made of ; and mankind</l>
     <l n="212">To passion , interest , pleasure , whim , resign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="213">Insist on , as if each were his own pope ,</l>
     <l n="214">Forgiveness , and the privilege of hope ;</l>
     <l n="215">But conscience , in some awful silent hour ,</l>
     <l n="216">When captivating lusts have lost their power ,</l>
     <l n="217">Perhaps when sickness , or some fearful dream ,</l>
     <l n="218">Reminds him of religion , hated theme !</l>
     <l n="219">Starts from the down , on which she lately slept ,</l>
     <l n="220">And tells of laws despised , at least not kept ;</l>
     <l n="221">Shows with a pointing finger , but no noise ,</l>
     <l n="222">A pale procession of past sinful joys ,</l>
     <l n="223">All witnesses of blessings foully scorn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="224">And life abused , and not to be suborn 'd .</l>
     <l n="225">Mark these , she says ; these , summon 'd from afar ,</l>
     <l n="226">Begin their march to meet thee at the bar ;</l>
     <l n="227">There find a Judge inexorably just ,</l>
     <l n="228">And perish there , as all presumption must .</l>
     <l n="229">Peace be to those ( such peace as earth can give )</l>
     <l n="230">Who live in pleasure , dead e'en while they live ;</l>
     <l n="231">Born capable indeed of heavenly truth ;</l>
     <l n="232">But down to latest age , from earliest youth ,</l>
     <l n="233">Their mind a wilderness through want of care ,</l>
     <l n="234">The plough of wisdom never entering there .</l>
     <l n="235">Peace ( if insensibility may claim</l>
     <l n="236">A right to the meek honours of her name )</l>
     <l n="237">To men of pedigree , their noble race ,</l>
     <l n="238">Emulous always of the nearest place</l>
     <l n="239">To any throne , except the throne of grace .</l>
     <l n="240">Let cottagers and unenlighten 'd swains</l>
     <l n="241">Revere the laws they dream that Heaven ordains ;</l>
     <l n="242">Resort on Sundays to the house of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="243">And ask , and fancy they find , blessings there .</l>
     <l n="244">Themselves , perhaps , when weary they retreat</l>
     <l n="245">To enjoy cool nature in a country seat ,</l>
     <l n="246">To exchange the centre of a thousand trades ,</l>
     <l n="247">For clumps , and lawns , and temples , and cascades ,</l>
     <l n="248">May now and then their velvet cushions take ,</l>
     <l n="249">And seem to pray for good example sake ;</l>
     <l n="250">Judging , in charity no doubt , the town</l>
     <l n="251">Pious enough , and having need of none .</l>
     <l n="252">Kind souls ! to teach their tenantry to prize</l>
     <l n="253">What they themselves , without remorse , despise :</l>
     <l n="254">Nor hope have they , nor fear , of aught to come ,</l>
     <l n="255">As well for them had prophecy been dumb ;</l>
     <l n="256">They could have held the conduct they pursue ,</l>
     <l n="257">Had Paul of Tarsus lived and died a Jew ;</l>
     <l n="258">And truth , proposed to reasoners wise as they ,</l>
     <l n="259">Is a pearl cast — completely cast away ,</l>
     <l n="260">They die .— Death lends them , pleased , and as in sport ,</l>
     <l n="261">All the grim honours of his ghastly court .</l>
     <l n="262">Far other paintings grace the chamber now ,</l>
     <l n="263">Where late we saw the mimic landscape glow :</l>
     <l n="264">The busy heralds hang the sable scene</l>
     <l n="265">With mournful ‘ scutcheons , and dim lamps between ;</l>
     <l n="266">Proclaim their titles to the crowd around ,</l>
     <l n="267">But they that wore them move not at the sound ;</l>
     <l n="268">The coronet , placed idly at their head ,</l>
     <l n="269">Adds nothing now to the degraded dead ,</l>
     <l n="270">And e'en the star , that glitters on the bier ,</l>
     <l n="271">Can only say — Nobility lies here .</l>
     <l n="272">Peace to all such — ‘ twere pity to offend ,</l>
     <l n="273">By useless censure , whom we cannot mend ;</l>
     <l n="274">Life without hope can close but in despair ,</l>
     <l n="275">‘ Twas there we found them , and must leave them there .</l>
     <l n="276">As when two pilgrims in a forest stray ,</l>
     <l n="277">Both may be lost , yet each in his own way ;</l>
     <l n="278">So fares it with the multitudes beguiled</l>
     <l n="279">In vain opinion 's waste and dangerous wild ;</l>
     <l n="280">Ten thousand rove the brakes and thorns among ,</l>

     <l n="582">He followed Paul ; his zeal a kindred flame ,</l>
     <l n="583">His apostolic charity the same .</l>
     <l n="584">Like him , cross 'd cheerfully tempestuous seas ,</l>
     <l n="585">Forsaking country , kindred , friends , and ease ;</l>
     <l n="586">Like him he labour 'd , and like him content</l>
     <l n="587">To bear it , suffered shame where'er he went .</l>
     <l n="588">Blush , calumny ! and write upon his tomb ,</l>
     <l n="589">If honest eulogy can spare thee room ,</l>
     <l n="590">Thy deep repentance of thy thousand lies ,</l>
     <l n="591">Which , aim 'd at him , have pierced the offended skies ;</l>
     <l n="592">And say , Blot out my sin , confess 'd , deplored ,</l>
     <l n="593">Against thine image , in thy saint , O Lord !</l>
     <l n="594">No blinder bigot , I maintain it still ,</l>
     <l n="595">Than he who must have pleasure , come what will :</l>
     <l n="596">He laughs , whatever weapon Truth may draw ,</l>
     <l n="597">And deems her sharp artillery mere straw ;</l>
     <l n="598">Scripture indeed is plain ; but God and he</l>
     <l n="599">On scripture ground are sure to disagree ;</l>
     <l n="600">Some wiser rule must teach him how to live ,</l>
     <l n="601">Than this his Maker has seen fit to give ;</l>
     <l n="602">Supple and flexible as Indian cane ,</l>
     <l n="603">To take the bend his appetites ordain ;</l>
     <l n="604">Contrived to suit frail nature 's crazy case ,</l>
     <l n="605">And reconcile his lusts with saving grace .</l>
     <l n="606">By this , with nice precision of design ,</l>
     <l n="607">He draws upon life 's map a zig-zag line ,</l>
     <l n="608">That shows how far ‘ tis safe to follow sin ,</l>
     <l n="609">And where his danger and God 's wrath begin .</l>
     <l n="610">By this he forms , as pleased he sports along ,</l>
     <l n="611">His well-poised estimate of right and wrong ;</l>
     <l n="612">And finds the modish manners of the day ,</l>
     <l n="613">Though loose , as harmless as an infant 's play .</l>
     <l n="614">Build by whatever plan caprice decrees ,</l>
     <l n="615">With what materials , on what ground you please ;</l>
     <l n="616">Your hope shall stand unblamed , perhaps admired ,</l>
     <l n="617">If not that hope the scripture has required .</l>
     <l n="618">The strange conceits , vain projects , and wild dreams ,</l>
     <l n="619">With which hypocrisy for ever teems ,</l>
     <l n="620">( Though other follies strike the public eye ,</l>
     <l n="621">And raise a laugh ) pass unmolested by ;</l>
     <l n="622">But if , unblameable in word and thought ,</l>
     <l n="623">A MAN arise , a man whom God has taught ,</l>
     <l n="624">With all Elijah 's dignity of tone ,</l>
     <l n="625">And all the love of the beloved John ,</l>
     <l n="626">To storm the citadels they build in air ,</l>
     <l n="627">And smite the untemper 'd wall ; ‘ tis death to spare .</l>
     <l n="628">To sweep away all refuges of lies ,</l>
     <l n="629">And place , instead of quirks themselves devise ,</l>
     <l n="630">LAMA SABACTHANI before their eyes ;</l>
     <l n="631">To prove that without Christ all gain is loss ,</l>
     <l n="632">All hope despair , that stands not on his cross ;</l>
     <l n="633">Except the few his God may have impress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="634">A tenfold frenzy seizes all the rest .</l>
     <l n="635">Throughout mankind , the Christian kind at least ,</l>
     <l n="636">There dwells a consciousness in every breast ,</l>
     <l n="637">That folly ends where genuine hope begins ,</l>
     <l n="638">And he that finds his heaven must lose his sins .</l>
     <l n="639">Nature opposes , with her utmost force ,</l>
     <l n="640">This riving stroke , this ultimate divorce :</l>
     <l n="641">And , while Religion seems to be her view ,</l>
     <l n="642">Hates with a deep sincerity the true :</l>
     <l n="643">For this , of all that ever influenced man ,</l>
     <l n="644">Since Abel worshipp 'd , or the world began ,</l>
     <l n="645">This only spares no lust , admits no plea ,</l>
     <l n="646">But makes him , if at all , completely free ;</l>
     <l n="647">Sounds forth the signal , as she mounts her car ,</l>
     <l n="648">Of an eternal , universal war ;</l>
     <l n="649">Rejects all treaty , penetrates all wiles ,</l>
     <l n="650">Scorns with the same indifference frowns and smiles ;</l>
     <l n="651">Drives through the realms of sin , where riot reels ,</l>
     <l n="652">And grinds his crown beneath her burning wheels !</l>
     <l n="653">Hence all that is in man , pride , passion , art ,</l>
     <l n="654">Powers of the mind , and feelings of the heart ,</l>
     <l n="655">Insensible of truth 's almighty charms ,</l>
     <l n="656">Starts at her first approach , and sounds to arms !</l>
     <l n="657">While Bigotry , with well dissembled fears ,</l>
     <l n="658">His eyes shut fast , his fingers in his ears ,</l>
     <l n="659">Mighty to parry and push by God 's word</l>
     <l n="660">With senseless noise , his argument the sword ,</l>
     <l n="661">Pretends a zeal for godliness and grace ,</l>
     <l n="662">And spits abhorrence in the Christian 's face .</l>
     <l n="663">Parent of Hope , immortal Truth ! make known</l>
     <l n="664">Thy deathless wreaths and triumphs all thine own :</l>
     <l n="665">The silent progress of thy power is such ,</l>
     <l n="666">Thy means so feeble , and despised so much ,</l>
     <l n="667">That few believe the wonders thou hast wrought ,</l>
     <l n="668">And none can teach them but whom thou hast taught .</l>
     <l n="669">Oh see me sworn to serve thee , and command</l>
     <l n="670">A painter 's skill into a poet 's hand !</l>
     <l n="671">That , while I trembling trace a work divine ,</l>
     <l n="672">Fancy may stand aloof from the design ,</l>
     <l n="673">And light and shade , and every stroke , be thine .</l>
     <l n="674">If ever thou hast felt another 's pain ,</l>
     <l n="675">If ever when he sighed hast sighed again ,</l>
     <l n="676">If ever on thy eyelid stood the tear</l>
     <l n="677">That pity had engender 'd , drop one here .</l>
     <l n="678">This man was happy — had the world 's good word ,</l>
     <l n="679">And with it every joy it can afford ;</l>
     <l n="680">Friendship and love seem 'd tenderly at strife ,</l>
     <l n="681">Which most should sweeten his untroubled life ;</l>
     <l n="682">Politely learn 'd , and of a gentle race ,</l>
     <l n="683">Good breeding and good sense gave all a grace ,</l>
     <l n="684">And whether at the toilette of the fair</l>
     <l n="685">He laugh 'd and trifled , made him welcome there ,</l>
     <l n="686">Or , if in masculine debate he shared ,</l>
     <l n="687">Ensured him mute attention and regard .</l>
     <l n="688">Alas , how changed ! Expressive of his mind ,</l>
     <l n="689">His eyes are sunk , arms folded , head reclined ;</l>
     <l n="690">Those awful syllables , hell , death , and sin ,</l>
     <l n="691">Though whisper 'd , plainly tell what works within ;</l>
     <l n="692">That conscience there performs her proper part ,</l>
     <l n="693">And writes a doomsday sentence on his heart !</l>
     <l n="694">Forsaking and forsaken of all friends ,</l>
     <l n="695">He now perceives where earthly pleasure ends ;</l>
     <l n="696">Hard task ! for one who lately knew no care ,</l>
     <l n="697">And harder still as learnt beneath despair !</l>
     <l n="698">His hours no longer pass unmark 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="699">A dark importance saddens every day ;</l>
     <l n="700">He hears the notice of the clock , perplex 'd ,</l>
     <l n="701">And cries , Perhaps eternity strikes next !</l>
     <l n="702">Sweet music is no longer music here ,</l>
     <l n="703">And laughter sounds like madness in his ear :</l>
     <l n="704">His grief the world of all her power disarms ;</l>
     <l n="705">Wine has no taste , and beauty has no charms :</l>
     <l n="706">God 's holy word , once trivial in his view ,</l>
     <l n="707">Now by the voice of his experience true ,</l>
     <l n="708">Seems , as it is , the fountain whence alone</l>
     <l n="709">Must spring that hope he pants to make his own .</l>
     <l n="710">Now let the bright reverse be known abroad ;</l>
     <l n="711">Say man 's a worm , and power belongs to God .</l>
     <l n="712">As when a felon , whom his country 's laws</l>
     <l n="713">Have justly doom 'd for some atrocious cause ,</l>
     <l n="714">Expects , in darkness and heart-chilling fears ,</l>
     <l n="715">The shameful close of all his misspent years ;</l>
     <l n="716">If chance , on heavy pinions slowly borne ,</l>
     <l n="717">A tempest usher in the dreaded morn ,</l>
     <l n="718">Upon his dungeon walls the lightning play ,</l>
     <l n="719">The thunder seems to summon him away ;</l>
     <l n="720">The warder at the door his key applies ,</l>
     <l n="721">Shoots back the bolt , and all his courage dies :</l>
     <l n="722">If then , just then , all thoughts of mercy lost ,</l>
     <l n="723">When Hope , long lingering , at last yields the ghost ,</l>
     <l n="724">The sound of pardon pierce his startled ear ,</l>
     <l n="725">He drops at once his fetters and his fear ;</l>
     <l n="726">A transport glows in all he looks and speaks ,</l>
     <l n="727">And the first thankful tears bedew his cheeks .</l>
     <l n="728">Joy , far superior joy , that much outweighs</l>
     <l n="729">The comfort of a few poor added days ,</l>
     <l n="730">Invades , possesses , and o'erwhelms the soul</l>
     <l n="731">Of him , whom Hope has with a touch made whole .</l>
     <l n="732">‘ Tis heaven , all heaven , descending on the wings</l>
     <l n="733">Of the glad legions of the King of kings ;</l>
     <l n="734">‘ Tis more — ‘ tis God diffused through every part ,</l>
     <l n="735">‘ Tis God himself triumphant in his heart .</l>
     <l n="736">O welcome now the sun 's once hated light ,</l>
     <l n="737">His noonday beams were never half so bright .</l>
     <l n="738">Not kindred minds alone are call 'd to employ</l>
     <l n="739">Their hours , their days , in listening to his joy ;</l>
     <l n="740">Unconscious nature , all that he surveys ,</l>
     <l n="741">Rocks , groves , and streams must join him in his praise .</l>
     <l n="742">These are thy glorious works , eternal Truth ,</l>
     <l n="743">The scoff of wither 'd age and beardless youth ;</l>
     <l n="744">These move the censure and illiberal grin</l>
     <l n="745">Of fools that hate thee and delight in sin :</l>
     <l n="746">But these shall last when night has quench 'd the pole ,</l>
     <l n="747">And heav'n is all departed as a scroll .</l>
     <l n="748">And when , as justice has long since decreed ,</l>
     <l n="749">This earth shall blaze , and a new world succeed ,</l>
     <l n="750">Then these thy glorious works , and they who share</l>
     <l n="751">That hope which can alone exclude despair ,</l>
     <l n="752">Shall live exempt from weakness and decay ,</l>
     <l n="753">The brightest wonders of an endless day .</l>
     <l n="754">Happy the bard ( if that fair name belong</l>
     <l n="755">To him that blends no fable with his song )</l>
     <l n="756">Whose lines , uniting , by an honest art ,</l>
     <l n="757">The faithful monitor 's and poet 's part ,</l>
     <l n="758">Seek to delight , that they may mend mankind ,</l>
     <l n="759">And , while they captivate inform the mind :</l>
     <l n="760">Still happier , if he till a thankful soil ,</l>
     <l n="761">And fruit reward his honourable toil :</l>
     <l n="762">But happier far , who comfort those that wait</l>
     <l n="763">To hear plain truth at Judah 's hallow 'd gate :</l>
     <l n="764">Their language simple , as their manners meek ,</l>
     <l n="765">No shining ornaments have they to seek ;</l>
     <l n="766">Nor labour they , nor time , nor talents , waste ,</l>
     <l n="767">In sorting flowers to suit a fickle taste ;</l>
     <l n="768">But , while they speak the wisdom of the skies ,</l>
     <l n="769">Which art can only darken and disguise ,</l>
     <l n="770">The abundant harvest , recompense divine ,</l>
     <l n="771">Repays their work — the gleaning only mine .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Invocation to Charity — Social ties — Tribute to the humanity of Captain Cook — His character contrasted with that of Cortez , the conquer of Mexico — Degradation of Spain — Purpose of commerce — Gifts of art — The slave-trade and slavery — Slavery unnatural and unchristian — The duty of abating the woes of that state , and of enlightening the mind of the slave , enforced — Apostrophe to Liberty — Charity of Howard — Pursuits of philosophy — Reason learns nothing aright without the lamp of Revelation — True charity the offspring of divine truth — Supposed case of a blind nation and an optician — Portrait of Charity — Beauty of the Apostle 's definition of it — Alms as the means of lulling conscience — Pride and ostentation motives of charity — Character of satire — True charity inculcated — Christian charity should be universal — Happy effects that would result from universal charity .</head>
     <l n="1">Fairest and foremost of the train that wait</l>
     <l n="2">On man 's most dignified and happiest state ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whether we name thee Charity or Love ,</l>
     <l n="4">Chief grace below , and all in all above ,</l>
     <l n="5">Prosper ( I press thee with a powerful plea )</l>
     <l n="6">A task I venture on , impell 'd by thee :</l>
     <l n="7">Oh never seen but in thy blest effects ,</l>
     <l n="8">Or felt but in the soul that Heaven selects ;</l>
     <l n="9">Who seeks to praise thee , and to make thee known</l>
     <l n="10">To other hearts , must have thee in his own .</l>
     <l n="11">Come , prompt me with benevolent desires ,</l>
     <l n="12">Teach me to kindle at thy gentle fires ,</l>
     <l n="13">And , though disgraced and slighted , to redeem</l>
     <l n="14">A poet 's name , by making thee the theme .</l>
     <l n="15">God , working ever on a social plan ,</l>
     <l n="16">By various ties attaches man to man :</l>
     <l n="17">He made at first , though free and unconfined ,</l>
     <l n="18">One man the common father of the kind ;</l>
     <l n="19">That every tribe , though placed as he sees best ,</l>
     <l n="20">Where seas or deserts part them from the rest ,</l>
     <l n="21">Differing in language , manners , or in face ,</l>
     <l n="22">Might feel themselves allied to all the race .</l>
     <l n="23">When Cook — lamented , and with tears as just</l>
     <l n="24">As ever mingled with heroic dust —</l>
     <l n="25">Steer 'd Britain 's oak into a world unknown ,</l>
     <l n="26">And in his country 's glory sought his own ,</l>
     <l n="27">Wherever he found man to nature true ,</l>
     <l n="28">The rights of man were sacred in his view ;</l>
     <l n="29">He soothed with gifts , and greeted with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="30">The simple native of the new-found isle ;</l>
     <l n="31">He spurn 'd the wretch that slighted or withstood</l>
     <l n="32">The tender argument of kindred blood ;</l>
     <l n="33">Nor would endure that any should control</l>
     <l n="34">His freeborn brethren of the southern pole .</l>
     <l n="35">But , though some nobler minds a law respect ,</l>
     <l n="36">That none shall with impunity neglect ,</l>
     <l n="37">In baser souls unnumber 'd evils meet ,</l>
     <l n="38">To thwart its influence , and its end defeat .</l>
     <l n="39">While Cook is loved for savage lives he saved ,</l>
     <l n="40">See Cortez odious for a world enslaved !</l>
     <l n="41">Where wast thou then , sweet Charity ? where then ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thou tutelary friend of helpless men ?</l>
     <l n="43">Wast thou in monkish cells and nunneries found ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or building hospitals on English ground ?</l>
     <l n="45">No .— Mammon makes the world his legatee</l>
     <l n="46">Through fear , not love ; and Heaven abhors the fee .</l>
     <l n="47">Wherever found , ( and all men need thy care ,)</l>
     <l n="48">Nor age nor infancy could find thee there .</l>
     <l n="49">The hand that slew till it could slay no more</l>
     <l n="50">Was glued to the sword-hilt with Indian gore .</l>
     <l n="51">Their prince , as justly seated on his throne</l>
     <l n="52">As vain imperial Philip on his own ,</l>
     <l n="53">Trick 'd out of all his royalty by art ,</l>
     <l n="54">That stripp 'd him bare , and broke his honest heart ,</l>
     <l n="55">Died , by the sentence of a shaven priest ,</l>
     <l n="56">For scorning what they taught him to detest .</l>
     <l n="57">How dark the veil that intercepts the blaze</l>
     <l n="58">Of Heaven 's mysterious purposes and ways !</l>
     <l n="59">God stood not , though he seem 'd to stand , aloof ;</l>
     <l n="60">And at this hour the conqueror feels the proof :</l>
     <l n="61">The wreath he won drew down an instant curse ,</l>
     <l n="62">The fretting plague is in the public purse ,</l>
     <l n="63">The canker 'd spoil corrodes the pining state ,</l>
     <l n="64">Starved by that indolence their mines create .</l>
     <l n="65">Oh could their ancient Incas rise again ,</l>
     <l n="66">How would they take up Israel 's taunting strain !</l>
     <l n="67">Art thou too fallen , Iberia ? Do we see</l>
     <l n="68">The robber and the murderer weak as we ?</l>
     <l n="69">Thou , that hast wasted earth , and dared despise</l>
     <l n="70">Alike the wrath and mercy of the skies ,</l>
     <l n="71">Thy pomp is in the grave , thy glory laid</l>
     <l n="72">Low in the pits thine avarice has made .</l>
     <l n="73">We come with joy from our eternal rest</l>
     <l n="74">To see the oppressor in his turn oppress 'd .</l>
     <l n="75">Art thou the god , the thunder of whose hand</l>
     <l n="76">Roll 'd over all our desolated land ,</l>
     <l n="77">Shook principalities and kingdoms down ,</l>
     <l n="78">And made the mountains tremble at his frown ?</l>
     <l n="79">The sword shall light upon thy boasted powers ,</l>
     <l n="80">And waste them , as thy sword has wasted ours .</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tis thus Omnipotence his law fulfils ,</l>
     <l n="82">And vengeance executes what justice wills .</l>
     <l n="83">Again — the band of commerce was designed</l>
     <l n="84">To associate all the branches of mankind ;</l>
     <l n="85">And if a boundless plenty be the robe ,</l>
     <l n="86">Trade is the golden girdle of the globe .</l>
     <l n="87">Wise to promote whatever end he means ,</l>
     <l n="88">God opens fruitful Nature 's various scenes :</l>
     <l n="89">Each climate needs what other climes produce ,</l>
     <l n="90">And offers something to the general use ;</l>
     <l n="91">No land but listens to the common call ,</l>
     <l n="92">And in return receives supply from all .</l>
     <l n="93">This genial intercourse , and mutual aid ,</l>
     <l n="94">Cheers what were else a universal shade ,</l>
     <l n="95">Calls nature from her ivy-mantled den ,</l>

     <l n="403">Pants to communicate her noble fires .</l>
     <l n="404">She sees a world stark blind to what employs</l>
     <l n="405">Her eager thought , and feeds her flowing joys ;</l>
     <l n="406">Though wisdom hail them , heedless of her call ,</l>
     <l n="407">Flies to save some , and feels a pang for all :</l>
     <l n="408">Herself as weak as her support is strong ,</l>
     <l n="409">She feels that frailty she denied so long ;</l>
     <l n="410">And , from a knowledge of her own disease ,</l>
     <l n="411">Learns to compassionate the sick she sees .</l>
     <l n="412">Here see , acquitted of all vain pretence ,</l>
     <l n="413">The reign of genuine Charity commence .</l>
     <l n="414">Though scorn repay her sympathetic tears ,</l>
     <l n="415">She still is kind , and still she perseveres ;</l>
     <l n="416">The truth she loves a sightless world blaspheme ,</l>
     <l n="417">‘ Tis childish dotage , a delirious dream !</l>
     <l n="418">The danger they discern not they deny ;</l>
     <l n="419">Laugh at their only remedy , and die .</l>
     <l n="420">But still a soul thus touch 'd can never cease ,</l>
     <l n="421">Whoever threatens war , to speak of peace .</l>
     <l n="422">Pure in her aim , and in her temper mild ,</l>
     <l n="423">Her wisdom seems the weakness of a child :</l>
     <l n="424">She makes excuses where she might condemn ,</l>
     <l n="425">Reviled by those that hate her , prays for them ;</l>
     <l n="426">Suspicion lurks not in her artless breast ,</l>
     <l n="427">The worst suggested , she believes the best ;</l>
     <l n="428">Not soon provoked , however stung and teased ,</l>
     <l n="429">And , if perhaps made angry , soon appeased ;</l>
     <l n="430">She rather waives than will dispute her right ;</l>
     <l n="431">And , injured , makes forgiveness her delight .</l>
     <l n="432">Such was the portrait an apostle drew ,</l>
     <l n="433">The bright original was one he knew ;</l>
     <l n="434">Heaven held his hand , the likeness must be true .</l>
     <l n="435">When one , that holds communion with the skies ,</l>
     <l n="436">Has fill 'd his urn where these pure waters rise ,</l>
     <l n="437">And once more mingles with us meaner things ,</l>
     <l n="438">‘ Tis e'en as if an angel shook his wings ;</l>
     <l n="439">Immortal fragrance fills the circuit wide ,</l>
     <l n="440">That tells us whence his treasures are supplied .</l>
     <l n="441">So when a ship , well freighted with the stores</l>
     <l n="442">The sun matures on India 's spicy shores ,</l>
     <l n="443">Has dropp 'd her anchor , and her canvas furl 'd ,</l>
     <l n="444">In some safe haven of our western world ,</l>
     <l n="445">‘ Twere vain inquiry to what port she went ,</l>
     <l n="446">The gale informs us , laden with the scent .</l>
     <l n="447">Some seek , when queasy conscience has its qualms ,</l>
     <l n="448">To lull the painful malady with alms ;</l>
     <l n="449">But charity not feign 'd intends alone</l>
     <l n="450">Another 's good — theirs centres in their own ;</l>
     <l n="451">And , too short-lived to reach the realms of peace ,</l>
     <l n="452">Must cease for ever when the poor shall cease .</l>
     <l n="453">Flavia , most tender of her own good name ,</l>
     <l n="454">Is rather careless of her sister 's fame :</l>
     <l n="455">Her superfluity the poor supplies ,</l>
     <l n="456">But , if she touch a character , it dies .</l>
     <l n="457">The seeming virtue weigh 'd against the vice ,</l>
     <l n="458">She deems all safe , for she has paid the price :</l>
     <l n="459">No charity but alms aught values she ,</l>
     <l n="460">Except in porcelain on her mantel-tree .</l>
     <l n="461">How many deeds , with which the world has rung ,</l>
     <l n="462">From pride , in league with ignorance , have sprung !</l>
     <l n="463">But God o'errules all human follies still ,</l>
     <l n="464">And bends the tough materials to his will .</l>
     <l n="465">A conflagration , or a wintry flood ,</l>
     <l n="466">Has left some hundreds without home or food :</l>
     <l n="467">Extravagance and avarice shall subscribe ,</l>
     <l n="468">While fame and self-complacence are the bribe .</l>
     <l n="469">The brief proclaim 'd , it visits every pew ,</l>
     <l n="470">But first the squire 's , a compliment but due :</l>
     <l n="471">With slow deliberation he unties</l>
     <l n="472">His glittering purse , that envy of all eyes !</l>
     <l n="473">And , while the clerk just puzzles out the psalm ,</l>
     <l n="474">Slides guinea behind guinea in his palm ;</l>
     <l n="475">Till finding , what he might have found before ,</l>
     <l n="476">A smaller piece amidst the precious store ,</l>
     <l n="477">Pinch 'd close between his finger and his thumb ,</l>
     <l n="478">He half exhibits , and then drops the sum .</l>
     <l n="479">Gold , to be sure !— Throughout the town ‘ tis told</l>
     <l n="480">How the good squire gives never less than gold .</l>
     <l n="481">From motives such as his , though not the best ,</l>
     <l n="482">Springs in due time supply for the distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="483">Not less effectual than what love bestows ,</l>
     <l n="484">Except that office clips it as it goes .</l>
     <l n="485">But lest I seem to sin against a friend ,</l>
     <l n="486">And wound the grace I mean to recommend ,</l>
     <l n="487">( Though vice derided with a just design</l>
     <l n="488">Implies no trespass against love divine ,)</l>
     <l n="489">Once more I would adopt the graver style ,</l>
     <l n="490">A teacher should be sparing of his smile .</l>
     <l n="491">Unless a love of virtue light the flame ,</l>
     <l n="492">Satire is , more than those he brands , to blame :</l>
     <l n="493">He hides behind a magisterial air</l>
     <l n="494">His own offences , and strips others bare ;</l>
     <l n="495">Affects indeed a most humane concern ,</l>
     <l n="496">That men , if gently tutor 'd , will not learn ;</l>
     <l n="497">That mulish folly , not to be reclaim 'd</l>
     <l n="498">By softer methods , must be made ashamed ;</l>
     <l n="499">But ( I might instance in St. Patrick 's dean )</l>
     <l n="500">Too often rails to gratify his spleen .</l>
     <l n="501">Most satirists are indeed a public scourge ;</l>
     <l n="502">Their mildest physic is a farrier 's purge ;</l>
     <l n="503">Their acrid temper turns , as soon as stirr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="504">The milk of their good purpose all to curd .</l>
     <l n="505">Their zeal begotten , as their works rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="506">By lean despair upon an empty purse ,</l>
     <l n="507">The wild assassins start into the street ,</l>
     <l n="508">Prepared to poniard whomsoe'er they meet .</l>
     <l n="509">No skill in swordmanship , however just ,</l>
     <l n="510">Can be secure against a madman 's thrust ;</l>
     <l n="511">And even virtue , so unfairly match 'd ,</l>
     <l n="512">Although immortal , may be prick 'd or scratch 'd .</l>
     <l n="513">When scandal has new minted an old lie ,</l>
     <l n="514">Or tax 'd invention for a fresh supply ,</l>
     <l n="515">‘ Tis call 'd a satire , and the world appears</l>
     <l n="516">Gathering around it with erected ears :</l>
     <l n="517">A thousand names are toss 'd into the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="518">Some whisper 'd softly , and some twang 'd aloud ,</l>
     <l n="519">Just as the sapience of an author 's brain</l>
     <l n="520">Suggests it safe or dangerous to be plain .</l>
     <l n="521">Strange ! how the frequent interjected dash</l>
     <l n="522">Quickens a market , and helps off the trash ;</l>
     <l n="523">The important letters that include the rest ,</l>
     <l n="524">Serve as a key to those that are suppress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="525">Conjecture gripes the victims in his paw ,</l>
     <l n="526">The world is charm 'd , and Scrib escapes the law .</l>
     <l n="527">So , when the cold damp shades of night prevail ,</l>
     <l n="528">Worms may be caught by either head or tail ;</l>
     <l n="529">Forcibly drawn from many a close recess ,</l>
     <l n="530">They meet with little pity , no redress ;</l>
     <l n="531">Plung 'd in the stream , they lodge upon the mud ,</l>
     <l n="532">Food for the famish 'd rovers of the flood .</l>
     <l n="533">All zeal for a reform , that gives offence</l>
     <l n="534">To peace and charity , is mere pretence :</l>
     <l n="535">A bold remark ; but which , if well applied ,</l>
     <l n="536">Would humble many a towering poet 's pride .</l>
     <l n="537">Perhaps the man was in a sportive fit ,</l>
     <l n="538">And had no other play-place for his wit ;</l>
     <l n="539">Perhaps , enchanted with the love of fame ,</l>
     <l n="540">He sought the jewel in his neighbour 's shame ;</l>
     <l n="541">Perhaps — whatever end he might pursue ,</l>
     <l n="542">The cause of virtue could not be his view .</l>
     <l n="543">At every stroke wit flashes in our eyes ;</l>
     <l n="544">The turns are quick , the polish 'd points surprise ,</l>
     <l n="545">But shine with cruel and tremendous charms ,</l>
     <l n="546">That , while they please , possess us with alarms ;</l>
     <l n="547">So have I seen , ( and hasten 'd to the sight</l>
     <l n="548">On all the wings of holiday delight ,)</l>
     <l n="549">Where stands that monument of ancient power ,</l>
     <l n="550">Named with emphatic dignity , the Tower ,</l>
     <l n="551">Guns , halberts , swords , and pistols , great and small ,</l>
     <l n="552">In starry forms disposed upon the wall :</l>
     <l n="553">We wonder , as we gazing stand below ,</l>
     <l n="554">That brass and steel should make so fine a show ;</l>
     <l n="555">But , though we praise the exact designer 's skill ,</l>
     <l n="556">Account them implements of mischief still .</l>
     <l n="557">No works shall find acceptance in that day ,</l>
     <l n="558">When all disguises shall be rent away ,</l>
     <l n="559">That square not truly with the scripture plan ,</l>
     <l n="560">Nor spring from love to God , or love to man .</l>
     <l n="561">As he ordains things sordid in their birth</l>
     <l n="562">To be resolved into their parent earth ;</l>
     <l n="563">And , though the soul shall seek superior orbs ,</l>
     <l n="564">Whate'er this world produces , it absorbs ;</l>
     <l n="565">So self starts nothing , but what tends apace</l>
     <l n="566">Home to the goal , where it began the race .</l>
     <l n="567">Such as our motive is our aim must be ;</l>
     <l n="568">If this be servile , that can ne'er be free :</l>
     <l n="569">If self employ us , whatsoe'er is wrought ,</l>
     <l n="570">We glorify that self , not Him we ought ;</l>
     <l n="571">Such virtues had need prove their own reward ,</l>
     <l n="572">The Judge of all men owes them no regard .</l>
     <l n="573">True Charity , a plant divinely nursed ,</l>
     <l n="574">Fed by the love from which it rose at first ,</l>
     <l n="575">Thrives against hope , and , in the rudest scene ,</l>
     <l n="576">Storms but enliven its unfading green ;</l>
     <l n="577">Exuberant is the shadow it supplies ,</l>
     <l n="578">Its fruit on earth , its growth above the skies .</l>
     <l n="579">To look at Him , who form 'd us and redeem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="580">So glorious now , though once so disesteem 'd ;</l>
     <l n="581">To see a God stretch forth his human hand ,</l>
     <l n="582">To uphold the boundless scenes of his command ;</l>
     <l n="583">To recollect that , in a form like ours ,</l>
     <l n="584">He bruised beneath his feet the infernal powers ,</l>
     <l n="585">Captivity led captive , rose to claim</l>
     <l n="586">The wreath he won so dearly in our name ;</l>
     <l n="587">That , throned above all height , he condescends</l>
     <l n="588">To call the few that trust in him his friends ;</l>
     <l n="589">That , in the heaven of heavens , that space he deems</l>
     <l n="590">Too scanty for the exertion of his beams ,</l>
     <l n="591">And shines , as if impatient to bestow</l>
     <l n="592">Life and a kingdom upon worms below ;</l>
     <l n="593">That sight imparts a never-dying flame ,</l>
     <l n="594">Though feeble in degree , in kind the same .</l>
     <l n="595">Like him the soul , thus kindled from above ,</l>
     <l n="596">Spreads wide her arms of universal love ;</l>
     <l n="597">And , still enlarged as she receives the grace ,</l>
     <l n="598">Includes creation in her close embrace .</l>
     <l n="599">Behold a Christian !— and without the fires</l>
     <l n="600">The Founder of that name alone inspires ,</l>
     <l n="601">Though all accomplishment , all knowledge meet ,</l>
     <l n="602">To make the shining prodigy complete ,</l>
     <l n="603">Whoever boasts that name — behold a cheat !</l>
     <l n="604">Were love , in these the world 's last doting years ,</l>
     <l n="605">As frequent as the want of it appears ,</l>
     <l n="606">The churches warm 'd , they would no longer hold</l>
     <l n="607">Such frozen figures , stiff as they are cold ;</l>
     <l n="608">Relenting forms would lose their power , or cease ;</l>
     <l n="609">And e'en the dipp 'd and sprinkled live in peace :</l>
     <l n="610">Each heart would quit its prison in the breast ,</l>
     <l n="611">And flow in free communion with the rest .</l>
     <l n="612">The statesman , skill 'd in projects dark and deep ,</l>
     <l n="613">Might burn his useless Machiavel , and sleep :</l>
     <l n="614">His budget , often fill 'd , yet always poor ,</l>
     <l n="615">Might swing at ease behind his study door ,</l>
     <l n="616">No longer prey upon our annual rents ,</l>
     <l n="617">Or scare the nation with its big contents :</l>
     <l n="618">Disbanded legions freely might depart ,</l>
     <l n="619">And slaying man would cease to be an art .</l>
     <l n="620">No learned disputants would take the field ,</l>
     <l n="621">Sure not to conquer , and sure not to yield ;</l>
     <l n="622">Both sides deceived , if rightly understood ,</l>
     <l n="623">Pelting each other for the public good .</l>
     <l n="624">Did Charity prevail , the press would prove</l>
     <l n="625">A vehicle of virtue , truth , and love ;</l>
     <l n="626">And I might spare myself the pains to show</l>
     <l n="627">What few can learn , and all suppose they know .</l>
     <l n="628">Thus have I sought to grace a serious lay</l>
     <l n="629">With many a wild , indeed , but flowery spray ,</l>
     <l n="630">In hopes to gain , what else I must have lost ,</l>
     <l n="631">The attention pleasure has so much engross 'd .</l>
     <l n="632">But if unhappily deceived I dream ,</l>
     <l n="633">And prove too weak for so divine a theme ,</l>
     <l n="634">Let Charity forgive me a mistake ,</l>
     <l n="635">That zeal , not vanity , has chanced to make ,</l>
     <l n="636">And spare the poet for his subject 's sake .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>In conversation much depends on culture — Its results frequently insignificant — Indecent language and oaths reprobated — The author 's dislike of the clash of arguments — The noisy wrangler — Dubius an example of indecision — The positive pronounce without hesitation — The point of honour condemned — Duelling with fists instead of weapons proposed — Effect of long tales — The retailer of prodigies and lies — Qualities of a judicious tale — Smoking condemned — The emphatic speaker — The perfumed beau — The grave coxcomb — Sickness made a topic of conversation — Picture of a fretful temper — The bashful speaker — An English company — The sportsman — Influence of fashion on conversation — Converse of the two disciples going to Emmaus — Delights of religious conversation — Age mellows the speech — True piety often branded as fanatic frenzy — Pleasure of communion with the good — Conversation should be unconstrained — Persons who make the Bible their companion , charged with hypocrisy by the world — The charge repelled — The poet sarcastically surmises that his censure of the world may proceed from ignorance of its reformed manners — An apology for digression — Religion purifies and enriches conversation .</head>
     <l n="1">Though nature weigh our talents , and dispense</l>
     <l n="2">To every man his modicum of sense ,</l>
     <l n="3">And Conversation in its better part</l>
     <l n="4">May be esteem 'd a gift , and not an art ,</l>
     <l n="5">Yet much depends , as in the tiller 's toil ,</l>
     <l n="6">On culture , and the sowing of the soil .</l>
     <l n="7">Words learn 'd by rote a parrot may rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="8">But talking is not always to converse ;</l>
     <l n="9">Not more distinct from harmony divine ,</l>
     <l n="10">The constant creaking of a country sign .</l>
     <l n="11">As alphabets in ivory employ ,</l>
     <l n="12">Hour after hour , the yet unletter 'd boy ,</l>
     <l n="13">Sorting and puzzling with a deal of glee</l>
     <l n="14">Those seeds of science call 'd his A B C ;</l>
     <l n="15">So language in the mouths of the adult ,</l>
     <l n="16">Witness its insignificant result ,</l>
     <l n="17">Too often proves an implement of play ,</l>
     <l n="18">A toy to sport with , and pass time away .</l>
     <l n="19">Collect at evening what the day brought forth ,</l>
     <l n="20">Compress the sum into its solid worth ,</l>
     <l n="21">And if it weigh the importance of a fly ,</l>
     <l n="22">The scales are false , or algebra a lie .</l>
     <l n="23">Sacred interpreter of human thought ,</l>
     <l n="24">How few respect or use thee as they ought !</l>
     <l n="25">But all shall give account of every wrong ,</l>
     <l n="26">Who dare dishonour or defile the tongue ;</l>
     <l n="27">Who prostitute it in the cause of vice ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or sell their glory at a market-price ;</l>
     <l n="29">Who vote for hire , or point it with lampoon ,</l>
     <l n="30">The dear-bought placeman , and the cheap buffoon .</l>
     <l n="31">There is a prurience in the speech of some ,</l>
     <l n="32">Wrath stays him , or else God would strike them dumb :</l>
     <l n="33">His wise forbearance has their end in view ,</l>
     <l n="34">They fill their measure , and receive their due .</l>
     <l n="35">The heathen lawgivers of ancient days ,</l>
     <l n="36">Names almost worthy of a Christian 's praise ,</l>
     <l n="37">Would drive them forth from the resort of men ,</l>
     <l n="38">And shut up every satyr in his den .</l>
     <l n="39">Oh come not ye near innocence and truth ,</l>
     <l n="40">Ye worms that eat into the bud of youth !</l>
     <l n="41">Infectious as impure , your blighting power</l>
     <l n="42">Taints in its rudiments the promised flower ;</l>
     <l n="43">Its odour perish 'd and its charming hue ,</l>
     <l n="44">Thenceforth ‘ tis hateful , for it smells of you .</l>
     <l n="45">Not e'en the vigorous and headlong rage</l>
     <l n="46">Of adolescence , or a firmer age ,</l>
     <l n="47">Affords a plea allowable or just</l>
     <l n="48">For making speech the pamperer of lust ;</l>
     <l n="49">But when the breath of age commits the fault</l>
     <l n="50">‘ Tis nauseous as the vapour of a vault .</l>
     <l n="51">So wither 'd stumps disgrace the sylvan scene ,</l>
     <l n="52">No longer fruitful , and no longer green ;</l>
     <l n="53">The sapless wood , divested of the bark ,</l>
     <l n="54">Grows fungous , and takes fire at every spark .</l>
     <l n="55">Oaths terminate , as Paul observes , all strife —</l>
     <l n="56">Some men have surely then a peaceful life !</l>
     <l n="57">Whatever subject occupy discourse ,</l>
     <l n="58">The feats of Vestris , or the naval force ,</l>
     <l n="59">Asseveration blustering in your face</l>

     <l n="62">Well known , or such as no man ever knew ,</l>
     <l n="63">They fix attention , heedless of your pain ,</l>
     <l n="64">With oaths like rivets forced into the brain ;</l>
     <l n="65">And e'en when sober truth prevails throughout ,</l>
     <l n="66">They swear it , till affirmance breeds a doubt .</l>
     <l n="67">A Persian , humble servant of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="68">Who , though devout , yet bigotry had none ,</l>
     <l n="69">Hearing a lawyer , grave in his address ,</l>
     <l n="70">With adjurations every word impress ,</l>
     <l n="71">Supposed the man a bishop , or at least ,</l>
     <l n="72">God 's name so much upon his lips , a priest ;</l>
     <l n="73">Bow 'd at the close with all his graceful airs ,</l>
     <l n="74">And begg 'd an interest in his frequent prayers .</l>
     <l n="75">Go , quit the rank to which ye stood preferr 'd ,</l>

     <l n="77">Religion , virtue , reason , common sense ,</l>
     <l n="78">Pronounce your human form a false pretence :</l>
     <l n="79">A mere disguise , in which a devil lurks ,</l>
     <l n="80">Who yet betrays his secret by his works .</l>
     <l n="81">Ye powers who rule the tongue , if such there are ,</l>
     <l n="82">And make colloquial happiness your care ,</l>
     <l n="83">Preserve me from the thing I dread and hate ,</l>
     <l n="84">A duel in the form of a debate .</l>
     <l n="85">The clash of arguments and jar of words ,</l>
     <l n="86">Worse than the mortal brunt of rival swords ,</l>
     <l n="87">Decide no question with their tedious length ,</l>
     <l n="88">For opposition gives opinion strength ,</l>
     <l n="89">Divert the champions prodigal of breath ,</l>
     <l n="90">And put the peaceably disposed to death .</l>
     <l n="91">O thwart me not , Sir Soph , at every turn ,</l>
     <l n="92">Nor carp at every flaw you may discern ;</l>
     <l n="93">Though syllogisms hang not on my tongue ,</l>

     <l n="97">Not that all freedom of dissent I blame ;</l>
     <l n="98">No — there I grant the privilege I claim .</l>
     <l n="99">A disputable point is no man 's ground ;</l>
     <l n="100">Rove where you please , ‘ tis common all around .</l>
     <l n="101">Discourse may want an animated — No ,</l>
     <l n="102">To brush the surface , and to make it flow ;</l>
     <l n="103">But still remember , if you mean to please ,</l>
     <l n="104">To press your point with modesty and ease .</l>
     <l n="105">The mark , at which my juster aim I take ,</l>
     <l n="106">Is contradiction for its own dear sake .</l>
     <l n="107">Set your opinion at whatever pitch ,</l>
     <l n="108">Knots and impediments make something hitch ;</l>
     <l n="109">Adopt his own , ‘ tis equally in vain ,</l>
     <l n="110">Your thread of argument is snapp 'd again ;</l>
     <l n="111">The wrangler , rather than accord with you ,</l>
     <l n="112">Will judge himself deceived , and prove it too .</l>
     <l n="113">Vociferated logic kills me quite ,</l>
     <l n="114">A noisy man is always in the right ,</l>
     <l n="115">I twirl my thumbs , fall back into my chair ,</l>
     <l n="116">Fix on the wainscot a distressful stare ,</l>
     <l n="117">And , when I hope his blunders are all out ,</l>
     <l n="118">Reply discreetly — To be sure — no doubt !</l>
     <l n="119">DUBIUS is such a scrupulous good man —</l>
     <l n="120">Yes — you may catch him tripping , if you can .</l>
     <l n="121">He would not , with a peremptory tone ,</l>
     <l n="122">Assert the nose upon his face his own ;</l>
     <l n="123">With hesitation admirably slow ,</l>
     <l n="124">He humbly hopes — presumes — it may be so .</l>
     <l n="125">His evidence , if he were call 'd by law</l>
     <l n="126">To swear to some enormity he saw ,</l>
     <l n="127">For want of prominence and just relief ,</l>
     <l n="128">Would hang an honest man and save a thief .</l>
     <l n="129">Through constant dread of giving truth offence ,</l>
     <l n="130">He ties up all his hearers in suspense ;</l>
     <l n="131">Knows what he knows as if he knew it not ;</l>
     <l n="132">What he remembers seems to have forgot ;</l>
     <l n="133">His sole opinion , whatsoe'er befall ,</l>
     <l n="134">Centring at last in having none at all .</l>
     <l n="135">Yet , though he tease and balk your listening ear ,</l>
     <l n="136">He makes one useful point exceeding clear ;</l>
     <l n="137">Howe'er ingenious on his darling theme</l>
     <l n="138">A sceptic in philosophy may seem ,</l>
     <l n="139">Reduced to practice , his beloved rule</l>
     <l n="140">Would only prove him a consummate fool ;</l>
     <l n="141">Useless in him alike both brain and speech ,</l>
     <l n="142">Fate having placed all truth above his reach ,</l>
     <l n="143">His ambiguities his total sum ,</l>
     <l n="144">He might as well be blind , and deaf , and dumb .</l>
     <l n="145">Where men of judgment creep and feel their way ,</l>
     <l n="146">The positive pronounce without dismay ;</l>
     <l n="147">Their want of light and intellect supplied</l>
     <l n="148">By sparks absurdity strikes out of pride .</l>
     <l n="149">Without the means of knowing right from wrong ,</l>
     <l n="150">They always are decisive , clear , and strong .</l>
     <l n="151">Where others toil with philosophic force ,</l>
     <l n="152">Their nimble nonsense takes a shorter course ;</l>
     <l n="153">Flings at your head conviction in the lump ,</l>
     <l n="154">And gains remote conclusions at a jump :</l>
     <l n="155">Their own defect , invisible to them ,</l>
     <l n="156">Seen in another , they at once condemn ;</l>
     <l n="157">And , though self-idolised in every case ,</l>
     <l n="158">Hate their own likeness in a brother 's face .</l>
     <l n="159">The cause is plain , and not to be denied ,</l>
     <l n="160">The proud are always most provoked by pride .</l>
     <l n="161">Few competitions but engender spite ;</l>
     <l n="162">And those the most , where neither has a right .</l>
     <l n="163">The point of honour has been deem 'd of use ,</l>
     <l n="164">To teach good manners , and to curb abuse :</l>
     <l n="165">Admit it true , the consequence is clear ,</l>
     <l n="166">Our polish 'd manners are a mask we wear ,</l>
     <l n="167">And at the bottom barbarous still and rude ;</l>
     <l n="168">We are restrain 'd indeed , but not subdued .</l>
     <l n="169">The very remedy , however sure ,</l>
     <l n="170">Springs from the mischief it intends to cure ,</l>
     <l n="171">And savage in its principle appears ,</l>
     <l n="172">Tried , as it should be , by the fruit it bears .</l>
     <l n="173">‘ Tis hard , indeed , if nothing will defend</l>
     <l n="174">Mankind from quarrels but their fatal end ;</l>
     <l n="175">That now and then a hero must decease ,</l>
     <l n="176">That the surviving world may live in peace .</l>
     <l n="177">Perhaps at last close scrutiny may show</l>
     <l n="178">The practice dastardly , and mean , and low ;</l>
     <l n="179">That men engage in it compell 'd by force ;</l>
     <l n="180">And fear , not courage , is its proper source .</l>
     <l n="181">The fear of tyrant custom , and the fear</l>
     <l n="182">Lest fops should censure us , and fools should sneer .</l>
     <l n="183">At least to trample on our Maker 's laws ,</l>
     <l n="184">And hazard life for any or no cause ,</l>
     <l n="185">To rush into a fix 'd eternal state</l>
     <l n="186">Out of the very flames of rage and hate ,</l>
     <l n="187">Or send another shivering to the bar</l>
     <l n="188">With all the guilt of such unnatural war ,</l>
     <l n="189">Whatever use may urge , or honour plead ,</l>
     <l n="190">On reason 's verdict is a madman 's deed .</l>
     <l n="191">Am I to set my life upon a throw ,</l>
     <l n="192">Because a bear is rude and surly ? No —</l>
     <l n="193">A moral , sensible , and well-bred man</l>
     <l n="194">Will not affront me , and no other can .</l>
     <l n="195">Were I empower 'd to regulate the lists ,</l>
     <l n="196">They should encounter with well loaded fists ;</l>
     <l n="197">A Trojan combat would be something new ,</l>
     <l n="198">Let DARES beat ENTELLUS black and blue ;</l>
     <l n="199">Then each might show , to his admiring friends ,</l>
     <l n="200">In honourable bumps his rich amends ,</l>
     <l n="201">And carry , in contusions of his skull ,</l>
     <l n="202">A satisfactory receipt in full .</l>
     <l n="203">A story , in which native humour reigns ,</l>
     <l n="204">Is often useful , always entertains :</l>
     <l n="205">A graver fact , enlisted on your side ,</l>
     <l n="206">May furnish illustration , well applied ;</l>
     <l n="207">But sedentary weavers of long tales</l>
     <l n="208">Give me the fidgets , and my patience fails .</l>
     <l n="209">‘ Tis the most asinine employ on earth ,</l>
     <l n="210">To hear them tell of parentage and birth ,</l>
     <l n="211">And echo conversations dull and dry ,</l>

     <l n="213">At every interview their route the same ,</l>
     <l n="214">The repetition makes attention lame :</l>
     <l n="215">We bustle up with unsuccessful speed ,</l>
     <l n="216">And in the saddest part cry — Droll indeed !</l>
     <l n="217">The path of narrative with care pursue ,</l>
     <l n="218">Still making probability your clue ;</l>
     <l n="219">On all the vestiges of truth attend ,</l>
     <l n="220">And let them guide you to a decent end .</l>
     <l n="221">Of all ambitious man may entertain ,</l>
     <l n="222">The worst that can invade a sickly brain ,</l>
     <l n="223">Is that which angles hourly for surprise ,</l>
     <l n="224">And baits its hook with prodigies and lies .</l>
     <l n="225">Credulous infancy , or age as weak ,</l>
     <l n="226">Are fittest auditors for such to seek ,</l>
     <l n="227">Who to please others will themselves disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="228">Yet please not , but affront you to your face ,</l>
     <l n="229">A great retailer of this curious ware ,</l>
     <l n="230">Having unloaded and made many stare ,</l>
     <l n="231">Can this be true ?— an arch observer cries ;</l>
     <l n="232">Yes ( rather moved ) , I saw it with these eyes !</l>
     <l n="233">Sir ! I believe it on that ground alone ;</l>
     <l n="234">I could not , had I seen it with my own .</l>
     <l n="235">A tale should be judicious , clear , succinct ;</l>
     <l n="236">The language plain , the incidents well linked ;</l>
     <l n="237">Tell not as new what everybody knows ,</l>
     <l n="238">And , new or old , still hasten to a close ;</l>
     <l n="239">There , centring in a focus round and neat ,</l>
     <l n="240">Let all your rays of information meet .</l>
     <l n="241">What neither yields us profit nor delight</l>

     <l n="243">Guy Earl of Warwick and fair Eleanore ,</l>
     <l n="244">Or giant-killing Jack , would please me more .</l>
     <l n="245">The pipe , with solemn interposing puff ,</l>
     <l n="246">Makes half a sentence at a time enough ;</l>
     <l n="247">The dozing sages drop the drowsy strain ,</l>
     <l n="248">Then pause , and puff — and speak , and pause again .</l>
     <l n="249">Such often , like the tube they so admire ,</l>

     <l n="251">Pernicious weed ! whose scent the fair annoys ,</l>
     <l n="252">Unfriendly to society 's chief joys ,</l>
     <l n="253">Thy worst effect is banishing for hours</l>
     <l n="254">The sex whose presence civilizes ours ;</l>
     <l n="255">Thou art indeed the drug a gardener wants</l>
     <l n="256">To poison vermin that infest his plants ;</l>
     <l n="257">But are we so to wit and beauty blind ,</l>
     <l n="258">As to despise the glory of our kind ,</l>
     <l n="259">And show the softest minds and fairest forms</l>
     <l n="260">As little mercy as he grubs and worms ?</l>
     <l n="261">They dare not wait the riotous abuse</l>
     <l n="262">Thy thirst-creating steams at length produce ,</l>
     <l n="263">When wine has given indecent language birth ,</l>
     <l n="264">And forced the floodgates of licentious mirth ;</l>
     <l n="265">For seaborn Venus her attachment shows</l>
     <l n="266">Still to that element from which she rose ,</l>
     <l n="267">And , with a quiet which no fumes disturb ,</l>
     <l n="268">Sips meek infusions of a milder herb .</l>
     <l n="269">The emphatic speaker dearly loves to oppose ,</l>
     <l n="270">In contact inconvenient , nose to nose ,</l>
     <l n="271">As if the gnomon on his neighbour 's phiz ,</l>
     <l n="272">Touch 'd with the magnet , had attracted his .</l>
     <l n="273">His whisper 'd theme , dilated and at large ,</l>

     <l n="275">An extract of his diary — no more ,</l>
     <l n="276">A tasteless journal of the day before .</l>
     <l n="277">He walk 'd abroad , o'ertaken in the rain ,</l>
     <l n="278">Call 'd on a friend , drank tea , stepp 'd home again ,</l>
     <l n="279">Resumed his purpose , had a world of talk</l>

     <l n="282">Adieu , dear sir ! lest you should lose it now .</l>
     <l n="283">I cannot talk with civet in the room ,</l>
     <l n="284">A fine puss gentleman that 's all perfume ;</l>
     <l n="285">The sight 's enough — no need to smell a beau —</l>

     <l n="287">His odoriferous attempts to please</l>

     <l n="292">What makes some sick , and others à-la-mort ,</l>
     <l n="293">An argument of cogence , we may say ,</l>
     <l n="294">Why such a one should keep himself away .</l>
     <l n="295">A graver coxcomb we may sometimes see ,</l>
     <l n="296">Quite as absurd , though not so light as he :</l>
     <l n="297">A shallow brain behind a serious mask ,</l>
     <l n="298">An oracle within an empty cask ,</l>
     <l n="299">The solemn fop ; significant and budge ;</l>
     <l n="300">A fool with judges , amongst fools a judge .</l>
     <l n="301">He says but little , and that little said</l>
     <l n="302">Owes all its weight , like loaded dice , to lead .</l>
     <l n="303">His wit invites you by his looks to come ,</l>
     <l n="304">But when you knock it never is at home :</l>
     <l n="305">‘ Tis like a parcel sent you by the stage ,</l>
     <l n="306">Some handsome present , as your hopes presage ;</l>
     <l n="307">‘ Tis heavy , bulky , and bids fair to prove</l>
     <l n="308">An absent friend 's fidelity and love ,</l>
     <l n="309">But when unpack 'd your disappointment groans</l>
     <l n="310">To find it stuff 'd with brickbats , earth , and stones .</l>
     <l n="311">Some men employ their health , an ugly trick ,</l>
     <l n="312">In making known how oft they have been sick ,</l>
     <l n="313">And give us , in recitals of disease ,</l>
     <l n="314">A doctor 's trouble , but without the fees ;</l>
     <l n="315">Relate how many weeks they kept their bed ,</l>
     <l n="316">How an emetic or cathartic sped ;</l>
     <l n="317">Nothing is slightly touch 'd , much less forgot ,</l>
     <l n="318">Nose , ears and eyes , seem present on the spot .</l>
     <l n="319">Now the distemper , spite of draught or pill ,</l>
     <l n="320">Victorious seemed , and now the doctor 's skill ;</l>
     <l n="321">And now — alas for unforeseen mishaps !</l>
     <l n="322">They put on a damp nightcap and relapse ;</l>
     <l n="323">They thought they must have died , they were so bad :</l>
     <l n="324">Their peevish hearers almost wish they had .</l>
     <l n="325">Some fretful tempers wince at every touch ,</l>
     <l n="326">You always do too little or too much :</l>
     <l n="327">You speak with life , in hopes to entertain ,</l>
     <l n="328">Your elevated voice goes through the brain ;</l>
     <l n="329">You fall at once into a lower key ,</l>
     <l n="330">That 's worse — the drone-pipe of an humble bee .</l>
     <l n="331">The southern sash admits too strong a light ,</l>
     <l n="332">You rise and drop the curtain — now ‘ tis night .</l>
     <l n="333">He shakes with cold — you stir the fire and strive</l>
     <l n="334">To make a blaze — that 's roasting him alive .</l>
     <l n="335">Serve him with venison , and he wishes fish ;</l>
     <l n="336">With sole — that 's just the sort he would not wish .</l>
     <l n="337">He takes what he at first professed to loathe ,</l>
     <l n="338">And in due time feeds heartily on both ;</l>
     <l n="339">Yet still , o'erclouded with a constant frown ,</l>
     <l n="340">He does not swallow , but he gulps it down .</l>
     <l n="341">Your hope to please him vain on every plan ,</l>

     <l n="345">Thus always teasing others , always teased ,</l>
     <l n="346">His only pleasure is to be displeased .</l>
     <l n="347">I pity bashful men , who feel the pain</l>
     <l n="348">Of fancied scorn and undeserved disdain ,</l>
     <l n="349">And bear the marks upon a blushing face</l>
     <l n="350">Of needless shame and self-imposed disgrace .</l>
     <l n="351">Our sensibilities are so acute ,</l>
     <l n="352">The fear of being silent makes us mute .</l>
     <l n="353">We sometimes think we could a speech produce</l>
     <l n="354">Much to the purpose , if our tongues were loose ;</l>
     <l n="355">But , being tried , it dies upon the lip ,</l>
     <l n="356">Faint as a chicken 's note that has the pip :</l>
     <l n="357">Our wasted oil unprofitably burns ,</l>
     <l n="358">Like hidden lamps in old sepulchral urns .</l>
     <l n="359">Few Frenchmen of this evil have complain 'd ;</l>
     <l n="360">It seems as if we Britons were ordained ,</l>
     <l n="361">By way of wholesome curb upon our pride ,</l>
     <l n="362">To fear each other , fearing none beside .</l>
     <l n="363">The cause perhaps inquiry may descry ,</l>
     <l n="364">Self-searching with an introverted eye ,</l>
     <l n="365">Conceal 'd within an unsuspected part</l>
     <l n="366">The vainest corner of our own vain heart :</l>
     <l n="367">For ever aiming at the world 's esteem ,</l>
     <l n="368">Our self-importance ruins its own scheme ;</l>
     <l n="369">In other eyes our talents rarely shown ,</l>
     <l n="370">Become at length so splendid in our own ,</l>
     <l n="371">We dare not risk them into public view ,</l>
     <l n="372">Lest they miscarry of what seems their due .</l>
     <l n="373">True modesty is a discerning grace ,</l>
     <l n="374">And only blushes in the proper place ;</l>
     <l n="375">But counterfeit is blind , and skulks through fear ,</l>
     <l n="376">Where ‘ tis a shame to be ashamed to appear :</l>
     <l n="377">Humility the parent of the first ,</l>
     <l n="378">The last by vanity produced and nursed .</l>
     <l n="379">The circle form 'd , we sit in silent state ,</l>
     <l n="380">Like figures drawn upon a dial-plate ;</l>
     <l n="381">Yes , ma'am , and No , ma'am , utter 'd softly , show</l>
     <l n="382">Every five minutes how the minutes go ;</l>
     <l n="383">Each individual , suffering a constraint</l>
     <l n="384">Poetry may , but colours cannot , paint ;</l>
     <l n="385">And , if in close committee on the sky ,</l>
     <l n="386">Reports it hot or cold , or wet or dry ;</l>
     <l n="387">And finds a changing clime a happy source</l>
     <l n="388">Of wise reflection and well-timed discourse .</l>
     <l n="389">We next inquire , but softly and by stealth ,</l>
     <l n="390">Like conservators of the public health ,</l>
     <l n="391">Of epidemic throats , if such there are ,</l>
     <l n="392">And coughs , and rheums , and phthisic , and catarrh .</l>
     <l n="393">That theme exhausted , a wide chasm ensues ,</l>
     <l n="394">Fill 'd up at last with interesting news ,</l>
     <l n="395">Who danc 'd with whom , and who are like to wed ,</l>
     <l n="396">And who is hang 'd , and who is brought to bed :</l>
     <l n="397">But fear to call a more important cause ,</l>
     <l n="398">As if ‘ twere treason against English laws .</l>
     <l n="399">The visit paid , with ecstacy we come ,</l>
     <l n="400">As from a seven years ’ transportation , home ,</l>
     <l n="401">And there resume an unembarrass 'd brow ,</l>
     <l n="402">Recovering what we lost , we know not how ,</l>
     <l n="403">The faculties that seem 'd reduced to nought ,</l>
     <l n="404">Expression and the privilege of thought .</l>
     <l n="405">The reeking , roaring hero of the chase ,</l>
     <l n="406">I give him over as a desperate case .</l>
     <l n="407">Physicians write in hopes to work a cure ,</l>
     <l n="408">Never , if honest ones , when death is sure ;</l>
     <l n="409">And though the fox he follows may be tamed ,</l>
     <l n="410">A mere fox-follower never is reclaim 'd .</l>
     <l n="411">Some farrier should prescribe his proper course ,</l>
     <l n="412">Whose only fit companion is his horse ,</l>
     <l n="413">Or if , deserving of a better doom ,</l>
     <l n="414">The noble beast judge otherwise , his groom .</l>
     <l n="415">Yet e'en the rogue that serves him , though he stand</l>
     <l n="416">To take his honour 's orders , cap in hand ,</l>
     <l n="417">Prefers his fellow grooms with much good sense ,</l>
     <l n="418">Their skill a truth , his master 's a pretence .</l>
     <l n="419">If neither horse nor groom affect the ‘ squire ,</l>
     <l n="420">Where can at last his jockeyship retire ?</l>
     <l n="421">Oh , to the club , the scene of savage joys ,</l>
     <l n="422">The school of coarse good fellowship and noise ;</l>
     <l n="423">There , in the sweet society of those</l>
     <l n="424">Whose friendship from his boyish years he chose ,</l>
     <l n="425">Let him improve his talent if he can ,</l>
     <l n="426">Till none but beasts acknowledge him a man .</l>
     <l n="427">Man 's heart had been impenetrably seal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="428">Like theirs that cleave the flood or graze the field ,</l>
     <l n="429">Had not his Maker 's all-bestowing hand</l>
     <l n="430">Given him a soul , and bade him understand ;</l>
     <l n="431">The reasoning power vouchsafed , of course inferr 'd</l>
     <l n="432">The power to clothe that reason with his word ;</l>
     <l n="433">For all is perfect that God works on earth ,</l>
     <l n="434">And he that gives conception aids the birth .</l>
     <l n="435">If this be plain , ‘ tis plainly understood ,</l>
     <l n="436">What uses of his boon the Giver would .</l>
     <l n="437">The mind despatch 'd upon her busy toil ,</l>
     <l n="438">Should range where Providence has bless 'd the soil ;</l>
     <l n="439">Visiting every flower with labour meet ,</l>
     <l n="440">And gathering all her treasures sweet by sweet ,</l>
     <l n="441">She should imbue the tongue with what she sips ,</l>
     <l n="442">And shed the balmy blessing on the lips ,</l>
     <l n="443">That good diffused may more abundant grow ,</l>
     <l n="444">And speech may praise the power that bids it flow .</l>
     <l n="445">Will the sweet warbler of the livelong night ,</l>
     <l n="446">That fills the listening lover with delight ,</l>
     <l n="447">Forget his harmony , with rapture heard ,</l>
     <l n="448">To learn the twittering of a meaner bird ?</l>
     <l n="449">Or make the parrot 's mimicry his choice ,</l>
     <l n="450">That odious libel on a human voice ?</l>
     <l n="451">No — nature , unsophisticate by man ,</l>
     <l n="452">Starts not aside from her Creator 's plan ;</l>
     <l n="453">The melody , that was at first design 'd</l>
     <l n="454">To cheer the rude forefathers of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="455">Is note for note delivered in our ears ,</l>
     <l n="456">In the last scene of her six thousand years .</l>
     <l n="457">Yet Fashion , leader of a chattering train ,</l>
     <l n="458">Whom man , for his own hurt , permits to reign ,</l>
     <l n="459">Who shifts and changes all things but his shape ,</l>
     <l n="460">And would degrade her votary to an ape ,</l>
     <l n="461">The fruitful parent of abuse and wrong ,</l>
     <l n="462">Holds a usurp 'd dominion o'er his tongue ;</l>
     <l n="463">There sits and prompts him with his own disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="464">Prescribes the theme , the tone , and the grimace ,</l>
     <l n="465">And , when accomplish 'd in her wayward school ,</l>
     <l n="466">Calls gentleman whom she has made a fool .</l>
     <l n="467">‘ Tis an unalterable fix 'd decree ,</l>
     <l n="468">That none could frame or ratify but she ,</l>

     <l n="474">Be never named in ears esteem 'd polite ;</l>
     <l n="475">That he who dares , when she forbids , be grave ,</l>
     <l n="476">Shall stand proscribed , a madman or a knave ,</l>
     <l n="477">A close designer not to be believed ,</l>
     <l n="478">Or , if excused that charge , at least deceived .</l>
     <l n="479">Oh folly worthy of the nurse 's lap ,</l>
     <l n="480">Give it the breast , or stop its mouth with pap !</l>
     <l n="481">Is it incredible , or can it seem</l>
     <l n="482">A dream to any except those that dream ,</l>
     <l n="483">That man should love his Maker , and that fire ,</l>
     <l n="484">Warming his heart , should at his lips transpire ?</l>
     <l n="485">Know then , and modestly let fall your eyes ,</l>
     <l n="486">And veil your daring crest that braves the skies ;</l>
     <l n="487">That air of insolence affronts your God ,</l>
     <l n="488">You need his pardon , and provoke his rod :</l>
     <l n="489">Now , in a posture that becomes you more</l>
     <l n="490">Than that heroic strut assumed before ,</l>
     <l n="491">Know , your arrears with every hour accrue</l>
     <l n="492">For mercy shown , while wrath is justly due .</l>
     <l n="493">The time is short , and there are souls on earth ,</l>
     <l n="494">Though future pain may serve for present mirth ,</l>
     <l n="495">Acquainted with the woes that fear or shame ,</l>
     <l n="496">By fashion taught , forbade them once to name ,</l>
     <l n="497">And , having felt the pangs you deem a jest ,</l>
     <l n="498">Have proved them truths too big to be express 'd .</l>
     <l n="499">Go seek on revelation 's hallow 'd ground ,</l>
     <l n="500">Sure to succeed , the remedy they found ;</l>
     <l n="501">Touched by that power that you have dared to mock ,</l>
     <l n="502">That makes seas stable , and dissolves the rock ,</l>
     <l n="503">Your heart shall yield a life-renewing stream ,</l>
     <l n="504">That fools , as you have done , shall call a dream .</l>
     <l n="505">It happen 'd on a solemn eventide ,</l>
     <l n="506">Soon after He that was our surety died ,</l>
     <l n="507">Two bosom friends , each pensively inclined ,</l>
     <l n="508">The scene of all those sorrows left behind ,</l>
     <l n="509">Sought their own village , busied as they went</l>
     <l n="510">In musings worthy of the great event :</l>
     <l n="511">They spake of him they loved , of him whose life ,</l>
     <l n="512">Though blameless , had incurr 'd perpetual strife ,</l>
     <l n="513">Whose deeds had left , in spite of hostile arts ,</l>
     <l n="514">A deep memorial graven on their hearts .</l>
     <l n="515">The recollection , like a vein of ore ,</l>
     <l n="516">The farther traced , enrich 'd them still the more ;</l>
     <l n="517">They thought him , and they justly thought him , one</l>
     <l n="518">Sent to do more than he appear 'd to have done ;</l>
     <l n="519">To exalt a people , and to place them high</l>
     <l n="520">Above all else , and wonder 'd he should die .</l>
     <l n="521">Ere yet they brought their journey to an end ,</l>
     <l n="522">A stranger join 'd them , courteous as a friend ,</l>
     <l n="523">And ask 'd them , with a kind engaging air ,</l>
     <l n="524">What their affliction was , and begg 'd a share .</l>
     <l n="525">Inform 'd , he gather 'd up the broken thread ,</l>
     <l n="526">And , truth and wisdom gracing all he said ,</l>
     <l n="527">Explain 'd , illustrated , and search 'd so well</l>
     <l n="528">The tender theme on which they chose to dwell ,</l>
     <l n="529">That , reaching home , the night , they said , is near ,</l>
     <l n="530">We must not now be parted , sojourn here —</l>
     <l n="531">The new acquaintance soon became a guest ,</l>
     <l n="532">And made so welcome at their simple feast ,</l>
     <l n="533">He bless 'd the bread , but vanish 'd at the word ,</l>
     <l n="534">And left them both exclaiming , ‘ Twas the Lord !</l>
     <l n="535">Did not our hearts feel all he deign 'd to say ,</l>
     <l n="536">Did they not burn within us by the way ?</l>
     <l n="537">Now theirs was converse , such as it behoves</l>
     <l n="538">Man to maintain , and such as God approves :</l>
     <l n="539">Their views indeed were indistinct and dim ,</l>
     <l n="540">But yet successful , being aim 'd at him .</l>
     <l n="541">Christ and his character their only scope ,</l>
     <l n="542">Their object , and their subject , and their hope ,</l>
     <l n="543">They felt what it became them much to feel ,</l>
     <l n="544">And , wanting him to loose the sacred seal ,</l>
     <l n="545">Found him as prompt as their desire was true ,</l>
     <l n="546">To spread the new-born glories in their view .</l>
     <l n="547">Well — what are ages and the lapse of time</l>
     <l n="548">Match 'd against truths , as lasting as sublime ?</l>
     <l n="549">Can length of years on God himself exact ?</l>
     <l n="550">Or make that fiction which was once a fact ?</l>
     <l n="551">No — marble and recording brass decay ,</l>
     <l n="552">And , like the graver 's memory , pass away ;</l>
     <l n="553">The works of man inherit , as is just ,</l>
     <l n="554">Their author 's frailty , and return to dust :</l>
     <l n="555">But truth divine for ever stands secure ,</l>
     <l n="556">Its head is guarded as its base is sure ;</l>
     <l n="557">Fix 'd in the rolling flood of endless years ,</l>
     <l n="558">The pillar of the eternal plan appears ,</l>
     <l n="559">The raving storm and dashing wave defies ,</l>
     <l n="560">Built by that Architect who built the skies .</l>
     <l n="561">Hearts may be found , that harbour at this hour</l>
     <l n="562">That love of Christ , and all its quickening power ;</l>
     <l n="563">And lips unstained by folly or by strife ,</l>
     <l n="564">Whose wisdom , drawn from the deep well of life ,</l>
     <l n="565">Tastes of its healthful origin , and flows</l>
     <l n="566">A Jordan for the ablution of our woes .</l>
     <l n="567">O days of heaven , and nights of equal praise ,</l>
     <l n="568">Serene and peaceful as those heavenly days ,</l>
     <l n="569">When souls drawn upwards in communion sweet</l>
     <l n="570">Enjoy the stillness of some close retreat ,</l>
     <l n="571">Discourse , as if released and safe at home ,</l>
     <l n="572">Of dangers past , and wonders yet to come ,</l>
     <l n="573">And spread the sacred treasures of the breast</l>
     <l n="574">Upon the lap of covenanted rest !</l>
     <l n="575">What , always dreaming over heavenly things ,</l>
     <l n="576">Like angel-heads in stone with pigeon-wings ?</l>
     <l n="577">Canting and whining out all day the word ,</l>
     <l n="578">And half the night ? fanatic and absurd !</l>
     <l n="579">Mine be the friend less frequent in his prayers ,</l>
     <l n="580">Who makes no bustle with his soul 's affairs ,</l>
     <l n="581">Whose wit can brighten up a wint'ry day ,</l>
     <l n="582">And chase the splenetic dull hours away ;</l>
     <l n="583">Content on earth in earthly things to shine ,</l>
     <l n="584">Who waits for heaven ere he becomes divine ,</l>
     <l n="585">Leaves saints to enjoy those altitudes they teach ,</l>
     <l n="586">And plucks the fruit placed more within his reach .</l>
     <l n="587">Well spoken , advocate of sin and shame ,</l>
     <l n="588">Known by thy bleating , Ignorance thy name .</l>
     <l n="589">Is sparkling wit the world 's exclusive right ?</l>
     <l n="590">The fix 'd fee-simple of the vain and light ?</l>
     <l n="591">Can hopes of heaven , bright prospects of an hour ,</l>
     <l n="592">That come to waft us out of sorrow 's power ,</l>
     <l n="593">Obscure or quench a faculty that finds</l>
     <l n="594">Its happiest soil in the serenest minds ?</l>
     <l n="595">Religion curbs indeed its wanton play ,</l>
     <l n="596">And brings the trifler under rigorous sway ,</l>
     <l n="597">But gives it usefulness unknown before ,</l>
     <l n="598">And purifying , makes it shine the more .</l>
     <l n="599">A Christian 's wit is inoffensive light ,</l>
     <l n="600">A beam that aids , but never grieves the sight ;</l>
     <l n="601">Vigorous in age as in the flush of youth ;</l>
     <l n="602">‘ Tis always active on the side of truth ;</l>
     <l n="603">Temperance and peace ensure its healthful state ,</l>
     <l n="604">And make it brightest at its latest date .</l>
     <l n="605">Oh I have seen ( nor hope perhaps in vain ,</l>
     <l n="606">Ere life go down , to see such sights again )</l>
     <l n="607">A veteran warrior in the Christian field ,</l>
     <l n="608">Who never saw the sword he could not wield ;</l>
     <l n="609">Grave without dulness , learned without pride ,</l>
     <l n="610">Exact , yet not precise , though meek , keen-eyed ;</l>
     <l n="611">A man that would have foil 'd at their own play</l>
     <l n="612">A dozen would-be 's of the modern day ;</l>
     <l n="613">Who , when occasion justified its use ,</l>
     <l n="614">Had wit as bright as ready to produce ,</l>
     <l n="615">Could fetch from records of an earlier age ,</l>
     <l n="616">Or from philosophy 's enlighten 'd page ,</l>
     <l n="617">His rich materials , and regale your ear</l>
     <l n="618">With strains it was a privilege to hear :</l>
     <l n="619">Yet above all his luxury supreme ,</l>
     <l n="620">And his chief glory , was the gospel theme ;</l>
     <l n="621">There he was copious as old Greece or Rome ,</l>
     <l n="622">His happy eloquence seem 'd there at home ,</l>
     <l n="623">Ambitious not to shine or to excel ,</l>
     <l n="624">But to treat justly what he loved so well .</l>
     <l n="625">It moves me more perhaps than folly ought ,</l>
     <l n="626">When some green heads , as void of wit as thought ,</l>
     <l n="627">Suppose themselves monopolists of sense ,</l>
     <l n="628">And wiser men 's ability pretence .</l>
     <l n="629">Though time will wear us , and we must grow old ,</l>
     <l n="630">Such men are not forgot as soon as cold ,</l>
     <l n="631">Their fragrant memory will outlast their tomb ,</l>
     <l n="632">Embalm 'd for ever in its own perfume .</l>
     <l n="633">And to say truth , though in its early prime ,</l>
     <l n="634">And when unstain 'd with any grosser crime ,</l>
     <l n="635">Youth has a sprightliness and fire to boast ,</l>
     <l n="636">That in the valley of decline are lost ,</l>
     <l n="637">And virtue with peculiar charms appears ,</l>
     <l n="638">Crown 'd with the garland of life 's blooming years ;</l>
     <l n="639">Yet age , by long experience well inform 'd ,</l>
     <l n="640">Well read , well temper 'd , with religion warm 'd ,</l>
     <l n="641">That fire abated which impels rash youth ,</l>
     <l n="642">Proud of his speed , to overshoot the truth ,</l>
     <l n="643">As time improves the grape 's authentic juice ,</l>
     <l n="644">Mellows and makes the speech more fit for use ,</l>
     <l n="645">And claims a reverence in its shortening day ,</l>
     <l n="646">That ‘ tis an honour and a joy to pay .</l>
     <l n="647">The fruits of age , less fair , are yet more sound ,</l>
     <l n="648">Than those a brighter season pours around ;</l>
     <l n="649">And , like the stores autumnal suns mature ,</l>
     <l n="650">Through wintry rigours unimpair 'd endure .</l>
     <l n="651">What is fanatic frenzy , scorn 'd so much ,</l>
     <l n="652">And dreaded more than a contagious touch ?</l>
     <l n="653">I grant it dangerous , and approve your fear ,</l>
     <l n="654">That fire is catching , if you draw too near ;</l>
     <l n="655">But sage observers oft mistake the flame ,</l>
     <l n="656">And give true piety that odious name .</l>
     <l n="657">To tremble ( as the creature of an hour</l>

     <l n="753">Sincerity towards the heart-searching God</l>
     <l n="754">Has made the new-born creature her abode ,</l>
     <l n="755">Nor shall be found in unregenerate souls</l>
     <l n="756">Till the last fire burn all between the poles .</l>
     <l n="757">Sincerity ! why ‘ tis his only pride ,</l>
     <l n="758">Weak and imperfect in all grace beside ,</l>
     <l n="759">He knows that God demands his heart entire ,</l>
     <l n="760">And gives him all his just demands require .</l>
     <l n="761">Without it , his pretensions were as vain</l>
     <l n="762">As , having it , he deems the world 's disdain ;</l>
     <l n="763">That great defect would cost him not alone</l>
     <l n="764">Man 's favourable judgment but his own ;</l>
     <l n="765">His birthright shaken , and no longer clear</l>
     <l n="766">Than while his conduct proves his heart sincere .</l>
     <l n="767">Retort the charge , and let the world be told</l>
     <l n="768">She boasts a confidence she does not hold ;</l>
     <l n="769">That , conscious of her crimes , she feels instead</l>
     <l n="770">A cold misgiving and a killing dread :</l>
     <l n="771">That while in health the ground of her support</l>
     <l n="772">Is madly to forget that life is short ;</l>
     <l n="773">That sick she trembles , knowing she must die ,</l>
     <l n="774">Her hope presumption , and her faith a lie ;</l>
     <l n="775">That while she dotes and dreams that she believes ,</l>
     <l n="776">She mocks her Maker , and herself deceives ,</l>
     <l n="777">Her utmost reach , historical assent ,</l>
     <l n="778">The doctrines warp 'd to what they never meant ;</l>
     <l n="779">That truth itself is in her head as dull</l>
     <l n="780">And useless as a candle in a skull ,</l>
     <l n="781">And all her love of God a groundless claim ,</l>
     <l n="782">A trick upon the canvas , painted flame .</l>
     <l n="783">Tell her again , the sneer upon her face ,</l>
     <l n="784">And all her censures of the work of grace ,</l>
     <l n="785">Are insincere , meant only to conceal</l>
     <l n="786">A dread she would not , yet is forced to feel ;</l>
     <l n="787">That in her heart the Christian she reveres ,</l>
     <l n="788">And , while she seems to scorn him , only fears .</l>
     <l n="789">A poet does not work by square or line ,</l>
     <l n="790">As smiths and joiners perfect a design ;</l>
     <l n="791">At least we moderns , our attention less ,</l>
     <l n="792">Beyond the example of our sires digress ,</l>
     <l n="793">And claim a right to scamper and run wide ,</l>
     <l n="794">Wherever chance , caprice , or fancy guide .</l>
     <l n="795">The world and I fortuitously met ;</l>
     <l n="796">I owed a trifle , and have paid the debt ;</l>
     <l n="797">She did me wrong , I recompensed the deed ,</l>
     <l n="798">And , having struck the balance , now proceed .</l>
     <l n="799">Perhaps , however , as some years have pass 'd</l>
     <l n="800">Since she and I conversed together last ,</l>
     <l n="801">And I have lived recluse in rural shades ,</l>
     <l n="802">Which seldom a distinct report pervades ,</l>
     <l n="803">Great changes and new manners have occurr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="804">And blest reforms that I have never heard ,</l>
     <l n="805">And she may now be as discreet and wise ,</l>
     <l n="806">As once absurd in all discerning eyes .</l>
     <l n="807">Sobriety perhaps may now be found</l>
     <l n="808">Where once intoxication press 'd the ground ;</l>
     <l n="809">The subtle and injurious may be just ,</l>
     <l n="810">And he grown chaste that was the slave of lust ;</l>
     <l n="811">Arts once esteem 'd may be with shame dismiss 'd ;</l>
     <l n="812">Charity may relax the miser 's fist ;</l>
     <l n="813">The gamester may have cast his cards away ,</l>
     <l n="814">Forgot to curse , and only kneel to pray .</l>
     <l n="815">It has indeed been told me ( with what weight ,</l>
     <l n="816">How credibly , ‘ tis hard for me to state ,)</l>
     <l n="817">That fables old , that seem 'd for ever mute ,</l>
     <l n="818">Revived , are hastening into fresh repute ,</l>
     <l n="819">And gods and goddesses , discarded long ,</l>
     <l n="820">Like useless lumber or a stroller 's song ,</l>
     <l n="821">Are bringing into vogue their heathen train ,</l>
     <l n="822">And Jupiter bids fair to rule again ;</l>
     <l n="823">That certain feasts are instituted now ,</l>
     <l n="824">Where Venus hears the lover 's tender vow ;</l>
     <l n="825">That all Olympus through the country roves ,</l>
     <l n="826">To consecrate our few remaining groves ,</l>
     <l n="827">And Echo learns politely to repeat</l>
     <l n="828">The praise of names for ages obsolete ;</l>
     <l n="829">That having proved the weakness , it should seem ,</l>
     <l n="830">Of revelation 's ineffectual beam ,</l>
     <l n="831">To bring the passions under sober sway ,</l>
     <l n="832">And give the moral springs their proper play ,</l>
     <l n="833">They mean to try what may at last be done ,</l>
     <l n="834">By stout substantial gods of wood and stone ,</l>
     <l n="835">And whether Roman rites may not produce</l>
     <l n="836">The virtues of old Rome for English use .</l>
     <l n="837">May such success attend the pious plan ,</l>
     <l n="838">May Mercury once more embellish man ,</l>
     <l n="839">Grace him again with long forgotten arts ,</l>
     <l n="840">Reclaim his taste , and brighten up his parts ,</l>
     <l n="841">Make him athletic as in days of old ,</l>
     <l n="842">Learn 'd at the bar , in the palæstra bold ,</l>
     <l n="843">Divest the rougher sex of female airs ,</l>
     <l n="844">And teach the softer not to copy theirs :</l>
     <l n="845">The change shall please , nor shall it matter aught ,</l>
     <l n="846">Who works the wonder , if it be but wrought .</l>
     <l n="847">‘ Tis time , however , if the case stands thus ,</l>
     <l n="848">For us plain folks , and all who side with us ,</l>
     <l n="849">To build our altar , confident and bold ,</l>
     <l n="850">And say , as stern Elijah said of old ,</l>
     <l n="851">The strife now stands upon a fair award ,</l>
     <l n="852">If Israel 's Lord be God , then serve the Lord :</l>
     <l n="853">If he be silent , faith is all a whim ,</l>
     <l n="854">Then Baal is the God , and worship him .</l>
     <l n="855">Digression is so much in modern use ,</l>
     <l n="856">Thought is so rare , and fancy so profuse ,</l>
     <l n="857">Some never seem so wide of their intent ,</l>
     <l n="858">As when returning to the theme they meant ;</l>
     <l n="859">As mendicants , whose business is to roam ,</l>
     <l n="860">Make every parish but their own their home .</l>
     <l n="861">Though such continual zigzags in a book ,</l>
     <l n="862">Such drunken reelings have an awkward look ,</l>
     <l n="863">And I had rather creep to what is true ,</l>
     <l n="864">Than rove and stagger with no mark in view ;</l>
     <l n="865">Yet to consult a little , seem 'd no crime ,</l>
     <l n="866">The freakish humour of the present time :</l>
     <l n="867">But now to gather up what seems dispersed ,</l>
     <l n="868">And touch the subject I design 'd at first ,</l>
     <l n="869">May prove , though much beside the rules of art ,</l>
     <l n="870">Best for the public , and my wisest part .</l>
     <l n="871">And first , let no man charge me , that I mean</l>
     <l n="872">To clothe in sable every social scene ,</l>
     <l n="873">And give good company a face severe ,</l>
     <l n="874">As if they met around a father 's bier ;</l>
     <l n="875">For tell some men that , pleasure all their bent ,</l>
     <l n="876">And laughter all their work , is life misspent ,</l>
     <l n="877">Their wisdom bursts into this sage reply ,</l>
     <l n="878">Then mirth is sin , and we should always cry .</l>
     <l n="879">To find the medium asks some share of wit ,</l>
     <l n="880">And therefore ‘ tis a mark fools never hit .</l>
     <l n="881">But though life 's valley be a vale of tears ,</l>
     <l n="882">A brighter scene beyond that vale appears ,</l>
     <l n="883">Whose glory , with a light that never fades ,</l>
     <l n="884">Shoots between scatter 'd rocks and opening shades ,</l>
     <l n="885">And , while it shows the land the soul desires ,</l>
     <l n="886">The language of the land she seeks inspires .</l>
     <l n="887">Thus touch 'd , the tongue receives a sacred cure</l>
     <l n="888">Of all that was absurd , profane , impure ;</l>
     <l n="889">Held within modest bounds , the tide of speech</l>
     <l n="890">Pursues the course that truth and nature teach ;</l>
     <l n="891">No longer labours merely to produce</l>
     <l n="892">The pomp of sound , or tinkle without use :</l>
     <l n="893">Where'er it winds , the salutary stream ,</l>
     <l n="894">Sprightly and fresh , enriches every theme ,</l>
     <l n="895">While all the happy man possess 'd before ,</l>
     <l n="896">The gift of nature , or the classic store ,</l>
     <l n="897">Is made subservient to the grand design ,</l>
     <l n="898">For which Heaven form 'd the faculty divine .</l>
     <l n="899">So , should an idiot , while at large he strays ,</l>
     <l n="900">Find the sweet lyre on which an artist plays ,</l>
     <l n="901">With rash and awkward force the chords he shakes ,</l>
     <l n="902">And grins with wonder at the jar he makes ;</l>
     <l n="903">But let the wise and well-instructed hand</l>
     <l n="904">Once take the shell beneath his just command ,</l>
     <l n="905">In gentle sounds it seems as it complain 'd</l>
     <l n="906">Of the rude injuries it late sustain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="907">Till , tuned at length to some immortal song ,</l>
     <l n="908">It sounds Jehovah 's name , and pours his praise along .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>The busy universally desirous of retirement — Important purpose for which this desire was given to man — Musing on the works of the creation , a happy employment — The service of God not incompatible , however , with a life of business — Human life ; its pursuits — Various motives for seeking retirement — The poet 's delight in the study of nature — The lover 's fondness for retirement — The hypochondriac — Melancholy , a malady that claims most compassion , receives the least — Sufferings of the melancholy man — The statesman 's retirement — His new mode of life and company — Soon weary of retirement , he returns to his former pursuits — Citizens ’ villas — Fashion of frequenting watering-places — The ocean — The spendthrift in forced retirement — The sportsman ostler — The management of leisure a difficult task — Man will be summoned to account for the employment of life — Books and friends requisite for the man of leisure ; and divine communion to fill the remaining void — Religion not adverse to innocent pleasures — The poet concludes with reference to his own pursuit .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hackney 'd in business , wearied at that oar ,</l>
     <l n="2">Which thousands , once fast chain 'd to , quit no more ,</l>
     <l n="3">But which , when life at ebb runs weak and low ,</l>
     <l n="4">All wish , or seem to wish , they could forego ;</l>
     <l n="5">The statesman , lawyer , merchant , man of trade ,</l>
     <l n="6">Pants for the refuge of some rural shade ,</l>
     <l n="7">Where , all his long anxieties forgot</l>
     <l n="8">Amid the charms of a sequester 'd spot ,</l>
     <l n="9">Or recollected only to gild o'er ,</l>
     <l n="10">And add a smile to what was sweet before ,</l>
     <l n="11">He may possess the joys he thinks he sees ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lay his old age upon the lap of ease ,</l>
     <l n="13">Improve the remnant of his wasted span ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , having lived a trifler , die a man .</l>
     <l n="15">Thus conscience pleads her cause within the breast ,</l>
     <l n="16">Though long rebell 'd against , not yet suppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="17">And calls a creature form 'd for God alone ,</l>
     <l n="18">For Heaven 's high purposes , and not his own ,</l>

     <l n="20">From what debilitates and what inflames ,</l>
     <l n="21">From cities humming with a restless crowd ,</l>
     <l n="22">Sordid as active , ignorant as loud ,</l>
     <l n="23">Whose highest praise is that they live in vain ,</l>
     <l n="24">The dupes of pleasure , or the slaves of gain ,</l>
     <l n="25">Where works of man are cluster 'd close around ,</l>
     <l n="26">And works of God are hardly to be found ,</l>
     <l n="27">To regions where , in spite of sin and woe ,</l>
     <l n="28">Traces of Eden are still seen below ,</l>
     <l n="29">Where mountain , river , forest , field , and grove ,</l>
     <l n="30">Remind him of his Maker 's power and love .</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Tis well if , look 'd for at so late a day ,</l>
     <l n="32">In the last scene of such a senseless play ,</l>
     <l n="33">True wisdom will attend his feeble call ,</l>
     <l n="34">And grace his action ere the curtain fall .</l>
     <l n="35">Souls , that have long despised their heavenly birth ,</l>
     <l n="36">Their wishes all impregnated with earth ,</l>
     <l n="37">For threescore years employ 'd with ceaseless care</l>
     <l n="38">In catching smoke and feeding upon air ,</l>

     <l n="42">Their fibres penetrate its tenderest part ,</l>
     <l n="43">And , draining its nutritious powers to feed</l>
     <l n="44">Their noxious growth , starve every better seed .</l>
     <l n="45">Happy , if full of days — but happier far ,</l>
     <l n="46">If , ere we yet discern life 's evening star ,</l>
     <l n="47">Sick of the service of a world , that feeds</l>
     <l n="48">Its patient drudges with dry chaff and weeds ,</l>
     <l n="49">We can escape from custom 's idiot sway ,</l>
     <l n="50">To serve the sovereign we were born to obey .</l>
     <l n="51">Then sweet to muse upon his skill display 'd</l>
     <l n="52">( Infinite skill ) in all that he has made !</l>
     <l n="53">To trace in nature 's most minute design</l>
     <l n="54">The signature and stamp of power divine ,</l>
     <l n="55">Contrivance intricate , express 'd with ease ,</l>
     <l n="56">Where unassisted sight no beauty sees ,</l>
     <l n="57">The shapely limb and lubricated joint ,</l>
     <l n="58">Within the small dimensions of a point ,</l>
     <l n="59">Muscle and nerve miraculously spun ,</l>
     <l n="60">His mighty work , who speaks and it is done ,</l>
     <l n="61">The invisible in things scarce seen reveal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="62">To whom an atom is an ample field :</l>
     <l n="63">To wonder at a thousand insect forms ,</l>
     <l n="64">These hatch 'd , and those resuscitated worms ,</l>
     <l n="65">New life ordain 'd and brighter scenes to share ,</l>
     <l n="66">Once prone on earth , now buoyant upon air ,</l>
     <l n="67">Whose shape would make them , had they bulk and size ,</l>
     <l n="68">More hideous foes than fancy can devise ;</l>
     <l n="69">With helmet-heads and dragon-scales adorn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="70">The mighty myriads , now securely scorn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="71">Would mock the majesty of man 's high birth ,</l>
     <l n="72">Despise his bulwarks , and unpeople earth :</l>
     <l n="73">Then with a glance of fancy to survey ,</l>
     <l n="74">Far as the faculty can stretch away ,</l>
     <l n="75">Ten thousand rivers pour 'd at his command ,</l>
     <l n="76">From urns that never fail , through every land ;</l>
     <l n="77">These like a deluge with impetuous force ,</l>
     <l n="78">Those winding modestly a silent course ;</l>
     <l n="79">The cloud-surmounting Alps , the fruitful vales ;</l>
     <l n="80">Seas , on which every nation spreads her sails ;</l>
     <l n="81">The sun , a world whence other worlds drink light ,</l>
     <l n="82">The crescent moon , the diadem of night :</l>
     <l n="83">Stars countless , each in his appointed place ,</l>
     <l n="84">Fast anchor 'd in the deep abyss of space —</l>
     <l n="85">At such a sight to catch the poet 's flame ,</l>
     <l n="86">And with a rapture like his own exclaim</l>
     <l n="87">These are thy glorious works , thou Source of Good ,</l>
     <l n="88">How dimly seen , how faintly understood !</l>
     <l n="89">Thine , and upheld by thy paternal care ,</l>
     <l n="90">This universal frame , thus wondrous fair ;</l>
     <l n="91">Thy power divine , and bounty beyond thought ,</l>
     <l n="92">Adored and praised in all that thou hast wrought .</l>
     <l n="93">Absorbed in that immensity I see ,</l>
     <l n="94">I shrink abased , and yet aspire to thee ;</l>

     <l n="101">The recompence that arts or arms can yield ,</l>
     <l n="102">The bar , the senate , or the tented field .</l>
     <l n="103">Compared with this sublimest life below ,</l>
     <l n="104">Ye kings and rulers , what have courts to show ?</l>
     <l n="105">Thus studied , used , and consecrated thus ,</l>
     <l n="106">On earth what is , seems form 'd indeed for us ;</l>
     <l n="107">Not as the plaything of a froward child ,</l>
     <l n="108">Fretful unless diverted and beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="109">Much less to feed and fan the fatal fires</l>
     <l n="110">Of pride , ambition , or impure desires ,</l>
     <l n="111">But as a scale , by which the soul ascends</l>
     <l n="112">From mighty means to more important ends ,</l>
     <l n="113">Securely , though by steps but rarely trod ,</l>
     <l n="114">Mounts from inferior beings up to God ,</l>
     <l n="115">And sees , by no fallacious light or dim ,</l>
     <l n="116">Earth made for man , and man himself for him .</l>
     <l n="117">Not that I mean to approve , or would enforce ,</l>
     <l n="118">A superstitious and monastic course :</l>
     <l n="119">Truth is not local , God alike pervades</l>
     <l n="120">And fills the world of traffic and the shades ,</l>
     <l n="121">And may be fear 'd amidst the busiest scenes ,</l>
     <l n="122">Or scorn 'd where business never intervenes .</l>
     <l n="123">But , ‘ tis not easy with a mind like ours ,</l>
     <l n="124">Conscious of weakness in its noblest powers ,</l>
     <l n="125">And in a world where , other ills apart ,</l>
     <l n="126">The roving eye misleads the careless heart ,</l>
     <l n="127">To limit thought , by nature prone to stray</l>
     <l n="128">Wherever freakish fancy points the way ;</l>
     <l n="129">To bid the pleadings of self-love be still ,</l>
     <l n="130">Resign our own and seek our Maker 's will ;</l>
     <l n="131">To spread the page of scripture , and compare</l>
     <l n="132">Our conduct with the laws engraven there ;</l>
     <l n="133">To measure all that passes in the breast ,</l>
     <l n="134">Faithfully , fairly , by that sacred test ;</l>
     <l n="135">To dive into the secret deeps within ,</l>
     <l n="136">To spare no passion and no favourite sin ,</l>
     <l n="137">And search the themes , important above all ,</l>
     <l n="138">Ourselves , and our recovery from our fall .</l>
     <l n="139">But leisure , silence , and a mind released</l>
     <l n="140">From anxious thoughts how wealth may be increased ,</l>
     <l n="141">How to secure , in some propitious hour ,</l>
     <l n="142">The point of interest or the post of power ,</l>
     <l n="143">A soul serene , and equally retired</l>
     <l n="144">From objects too much dreaded or desired ,</l>
     <l n="145">Safe from the clamours of perverse dispute ,</l>
     <l n="146">At least are friendly to the great pursuit .</l>
     <l n="147">Opening the map of God 's extensive plan ,</l>
     <l n="148">We find a little isle , this life of man ;</l>
     <l n="149">Eternity 's unknown expanse appears</l>
     <l n="150">Circling around and limiting his years .</l>
     <l n="151">The busy race examine and explore</l>
     <l n="152">Each creek and cavern of the dangerous shore ,</l>
     <l n="153">With care collect what in their eyes excels ,</l>
     <l n="154">Some shining pebbles , and some weeds and shells ,</l>
     <l n="155">Thus laden , dream that they are rich and great ,</l>
     <l n="156">And happiest he that groans beneath his weight .</l>
     <l n="157">The waves o'ertake them in their serious play ,</l>
     <l n="158">And every hour sweeps multitudes away ;</l>
     <l n="159">They shriek and sink , survivors start and weep ,</l>
     <l n="160">Pursue their sport , and follow to the deep .</l>
     <l n="161">A few forsake the throng ; with lifted eyes</l>
     <l n="162">Ask wealth of Heaven , and gain a real prize ,</l>
     <l n="163">Truth , wisdom , grace , and peace like that above ,</l>
     <l n="164">Seal 'd with his signet , whom they serve and love ;</l>
     <l n="165">Scorn 'd by the rest , with patient hope they wait</l>
     <l n="166">A kind release from their imperfect state ,</l>
     <l n="167">And unregretted are soon snatch 'd away</l>
     <l n="168">From scenes of sorrow into glorious day .</l>
     <l n="169">Nor these alone prefer a life recluse ,</l>
     <l n="170">Who seek retirement for its proper use ;</l>
     <l n="171">The love of change , that lives in every breast ,</l>
     <l n="172">Genius , and temper , and desire of rest ,</l>
     <l n="173">Discordant motives in one centre meet ,</l>
     <l n="174">And each inclines its votary to retreat .</l>
     <l n="175">Some minds by nature are averse to noise ,</l>
     <l n="176">And hate the tumult half the world enjoys ,</l>
     <l n="177">The lure of avarice , or the pompous prize</l>
     <l n="178">That courts display before ambitious eyes ;</l>
     <l n="179">The fruits that hang on pleasure 's flowery stem ,</l>
     <l n="180">Whate'er enchants them , are no snares to them .</l>
     <l n="181">To them the deep recess of dusky groves ,</l>
     <l n="182">Or forest , where the deer securely roves ,</l>
     <l n="183">The fall of waters , and the song of birds ,</l>
     <l n="184">And hills that echo to the distant herds ,</l>
     <l n="185">Are luxuries excelling all the glare</l>
     <l n="186">The world can boast , and her chief favourites share .</l>
     <l n="187">With eager step , and carelessly array 'd ,</l>
     <l n="188">For such a cause the poet seeks the shade ,</l>
     <l n="189">From all he sees he catches new delight ,</l>
     <l n="190">Pleased Fancy claps her pinions at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="191">The rising or the setting orb of day ,</l>
     <l n="192">The clouds that flit , or slowly float away ,</l>
     <l n="193">Nature in all the various shapes she wears ,</l>
     <l n="194">Frowning in storms , or breathing gentle airs ,</l>
     <l n="195">The snowy robe her wintry state assumes ,</l>
     <l n="196">Her summer heats , her fruits , and her perfumes ,</l>
     <l n="197">All , all alike transport the glowing bard ,</l>
     <l n="198">Success in rhyme his glory and reward .</l>
     <l n="199">O Nature ! whose Elysian scenes disclose</l>
     <l n="200">His bright perfections at whose word they rose ,</l>
     <l n="201">Next to that power who form 'd thee , and sustains ,</l>
     <l n="202">Be thou the great inspirer of my strains .</l>
     <l n="203">Still , as I touch the lyre , do thou expand</l>
     <l n="204">Thy genuine charms , and guide an artless hand ,</l>
     <l n="205">That I may catch a fire but rarely known ,</l>
     <l n="206">Give useful light , though I should miss renown ,</l>
     <l n="207">And , poring on thy page , whose every line</l>
     <l n="208">Bears proof of an intelligence divine ,</l>
     <l n="209">May feel a heart enrich 'd by what it pays ,</l>
     <l n="210">That builds its glory on its Maker 's praise .</l>
     <l n="211">Woe to the man whose wit disclaims its use ,</l>
     <l n="212">Glittering in vain , or only to seduce ,</l>
     <l n="213">Who studies nature with a wanton eye ,</l>
     <l n="214">Admires the work , but slips the lesson by ;</l>
     <l n="215">His hours of leisure and recess employs</l>
     <l n="216">In drawing pictures of forbidden joys ,</l>
     <l n="217">Retires to blazon his own worthless name ,</l>
     <l n="218">Or shoot the careless with a surer aim .</l>
     <l n="219">The lover too shuns business and alarms ,</l>
     <l n="220">Tender idolater of absent charms .</l>
     <l n="221">Saints offer nothing in their warmest prayers</l>
     <l n="222">That he devotes not with a zeal like theirs ;</l>
     <l n="223">‘ Tis consecration of his heart , soul , time ,</l>
     <l n="224">And every thought that wanders is a crime .</l>
     <l n="225">In sighs he worships his supremely fair ,</l>
     <l n="226">And weeps a sad libation in despair ;</l>
     <l n="227">Adores a creature , and , devout in vain ,</l>
     <l n="228">Wins in return an answer of disdain .</l>
     <l n="229">As woodbine weds the plant within her reach ,</l>
     <l n="230">Rough elm , or smooth-grain 'd ash , or glossy beech ,</l>
     <l n="231">In spiral rings ascends the trunk , and lays</l>
     <l n="232">Her golden tassels on the leafy sprays ,</l>
     <l n="233">But does a mischief while she lends a grace ,</l>
     <l n="234">Straightening its growth by such a strict embrace ;</l>
     <l n="235">So love , that clings around the noblest minds</l>
     <l n="236">Forbids the advancement of the soul he binds ;</l>
     <l n="237">The suitor 's air indeed he soon improves ,</l>
     <l n="238">And forms it to the taste of her he loves ,</l>
     <l n="239">Teaches his eyes a language , and no less</l>
     <l n="240">Refines his speech , and fashions his address ;</l>
     <l n="241">But farewell promises of happier fruits ,</l>
     <l n="242">Manly designs , and learning 's grave pursuits ;</l>
     <l n="243">Girt with a chain he cannot wish to break ,</l>
     <l n="244">His only bliss is sorrow for her sake ;</l>
     <l n="245">Who will may pant for glory and excel ,</l>
     <l n="246">Her smile his aim , all higher aims farewell !</l>
     <l n="247">Thyrsis , Alexis , or whatever name</l>
     <l n="248">May least offend against so pure a flame ,</l>
     <l n="249">Though sage advice of friends the most sincere</l>
     <l n="250">Sounds harshly in so delicate an ear ,</l>
     <l n="251">And lovers , of all creatures , tame or wild ,</l>
     <l n="252">Can least brook management , however mild ,</l>
     <l n="253">Yet let a poet ( poetry disarms</l>
     <l n="254">The fiercest animals with magic charms )</l>
     <l n="255">Risk an intrusion on thy pensive mood ,</l>
     <l n="256">And woo and win thee to thy proper good .</l>
     <l n="257">Pastoral images and still retreats ,</l>
     <l n="258">Umbrageous walks and solitary seats ,</l>
     <l n="259">Sweet birds in concert with harmonious streams ,</l>
     <l n="260">Soft airs , nocturnal vigils , and day-dreams ,</l>
     <l n="261">Are all enchantments in a case like thine ,</l>
     <l n="262">Conspire against thy peace with one design ,</l>
     <l n="263">Soothe thee to make thee but a surer prey ,</l>
     <l n="264">And feed the fire that wastes thy powers away .</l>
     <l n="265">Up — God has formed thee with a wiser view ,</l>
     <l n="266">Not to be led in chains , but to subdue ;</l>
     <l n="267">Calls thee to cope with enemies , and first</l>
     <l n="268">Points out a conflict with thyself , the worst .</l>
     <l n="269">Woman indeed , a gift he would bestow</l>
     <l n="270">When he design 'd a Paradise below ,</l>
     <l n="271">The richest earthly boon his hands afford ,</l>
     <l n="272">Deserves to be beloved , but not adored .</l>
     <l n="273">Post away swiftly to more actives scenes ,</l>
     <l n="274">Collect the scatter 'd truth that study gleans ,</l>
     <l n="275">Mix with the world , but with its wiser part ,</l>
     <l n="276">No longer give an image all thine heart ;</l>
     <l n="277">Its empire is not hers , nor is it thine ,</l>
     <l n="278">‘ Tis God 's just claim , prerogative divine .</l>
     <l n="279">Virtuous and faithful HEBERDEN , whose skill</l>
     <l n="280">Attempts no task it cannot well fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="281">Gives melancholy up to nature 's care ,</l>
     <l n="282">And sends the patient into purer air .</l>
     <l n="283">Look were he comes — in this embower 'd alcove</l>
     <l n="284">Stand close conceal 'd , and see a statue move :</l>
     <l n="285">Lips busy , and eyes fix 'd , foot falling slow ,</l>
     <l n="286">Arms hanging idly down , hands clasp 'd below ,</l>
     <l n="287">Interpret to the marking eye distress ,</l>
     <l n="288">Such as its symptoms can alone express .</l>
     <l n="289">That tongue is silent now ; that silent tongue</l>
     <l n="290">Could argue once , could jest , or join the song ,</l>
     <l n="291">Could give advice , could censure or commend ,</l>
     <l n="292">Or charm the sorrows of a drooping friend .</l>
     <l n="293">Renounced alike its office and its sport ,</l>
     <l n="294">Its brisker and its graver strains fall short ;</l>
     <l n="295">Both fail beneath a fever 's secret sway ,</l>
     <l n="296">And like a summer-brook are past away .</l>
     <l n="297">This is a sight for pity to peruse ,</l>
     <l n="298">Till she resemble faintly what she views ,</l>
     <l n="299">Till sympathy contract a kindred pain ,</l>
     <l n="300">Pierced with the woes that she laments in vain .</l>
     <l n="301">This , of all maladies that man infest ,</l>
     <l n="302">Claims most compassion , and receives the least :</l>
     <l n="303">Job felt it , when he groan 'd beneath the rod</l>
     <l n="304">And the barb 'd arrows of a frowning God ;</l>
     <l n="305">And such emollients as his friends could spare ,</l>
     <l n="306">Friends such as his for modern Jobs prepare .</l>
     <l n="307">Blest , rather curst , with hearts that never feel ,</l>
     <l n="308">Kept snug in caskets of close-hammer 'd steel ,</l>
     <l n="309">With mouths made only to grin wide and eat ,</l>
     <l n="310">And minds that deem derided pain a treat ,</l>
     <l n="311">With limbs of British oak , and nerves of wire ,</l>
     <l n="312">And wit that puppet prompters might inspire ,</l>
     <l n="313">Their sovereign nostrum is a clumsy joke</l>
     <l n="314">On pangs enforced with God 's severest stroke .</l>
     <l n="315">But , with a soul that ever felt the sting</l>
     <l n="316">Of sorrow , sorrow is a sacred thing :</l>
     <l n="317">Not to molest , or irritate , or raise</l>
     <l n="318">A laugh at his expense , is slender praise ;</l>
     <l n="319">He that has not usurp 'd the name of man</l>
     <l n="320">Does all , and deems too little all , he can ,</l>
     <l n="321">To assuage the throbbings of the fester 'd part ,</l>
     <l n="322">And staunch the bleedings of a broken heart .</l>
     <l n="323">‘ Tis not , as heads that never ache suppose ,</l>
     <l n="324">Forgery of fancy , and a dream of woes ;</l>
     <l n="325">Man is a harp , whose chords elude the sight ,</l>
     <l n="326">Each yielding harmony disposed aright ;</l>
     <l n="327">The screws reversed ( a task which if he please</l>
     <l n="328">God in a moment executes with ease ) ,</l>
     <l n="329">Ten thousand thousand strings at once go loose ,</l>
     <l n="330">Lost , till he tune them , all their power and use .</l>
     <l n="331">Then neither heathy wilds , nor scenes as fair</l>
     <l n="332">As ever recompensed the peasant 's care ,</l>
     <l n="333">Nor soft declivities with tufted hills ,</l>
     <l n="334">Nor view of waters turning busy mills ,</l>
     <l n="335">Parks in which art preceptress nature weds ,</l>
     <l n="336">Nor gardens interspersed with flowery beds ,</l>
     <l n="337">Nor gales , that catch the scent of blooming groves ,</l>
     <l n="338">And waft it to the mourner as he roves ,</l>
     <l n="339">Can call up life into his faded eye ,</l>
     <l n="340">That passes all he sees unheeded by ;</l>
     <l n="341">No wounds like those a wounded spirit feels ,</l>
     <l n="342">No cure for such , till God who makes them heals .</l>
     <l n="343">And thou , sad sufferer under nameless ill</l>
     <l n="344">That yields not to the touch of human skill ,</l>
     <l n="345">Improve the kind occasion , understand</l>
     <l n="346">A Father 's frown , and kiss his chastening hand .</l>
     <l n="347">To thee the day-spring , and the blaze of noon ,</l>
     <l n="348">The purple evening and resplendent moon ,</l>
     <l n="349">The stars that , sprinkled o'er the vault of night ,</l>
     <l n="350">Seem drops descending in a shower of light ,</l>
     <l n="351">Shine not , or undesired and hated shine ,</l>
     <l n="352">Seen through the medium of a cloud like thine :</l>
     <l n="353">Yet seek him , in his favour life is found ,</l>
     <l n="354">All bliss beside — a shadow or a sound :</l>
     <l n="355">Then heaven , eclipsed so long , and this dull earth ,</l>
     <l n="356">Shall seem to start into a second birth ;</l>
     <l n="357">Nature , assuming a more lovely face ,</l>
     <l n="358">Borrowing a beauty from the works of grace ,</l>
     <l n="359">Shall be despised and overlook 'd no more ,</l>
     <l n="360">Shall fill thee with delights unfelt before ,</l>
     <l n="361">Impart to things inanimate a voice ,</l>
     <l n="362">And bid her mountains and her hills rejoice ;</l>
     <l n="363">The sound shall run along the winding vales ,</l>
     <l n="364">And thou enjoy an Eden ere it fails .</l>
     <l n="365">Ye groves , ( the statesman at his desk exclaims ,</l>
     <l n="366">Sick of a thousand disappointed aims ,)</l>
     <l n="367">My patrimonial treasure and my pride ,</l>
     <l n="368">Beneath your shades your grey possessor hide ,</l>
     <l n="369">Receive me , languishing for that repose</l>
     <l n="370">The servant of the public never knows .</l>
     <l n="371">Ye saw me once ( ah , those regretted days ,</l>
     <l n="372">When boyish innocence was all my praise ! )</l>
     <l n="373">Hour after hour delightfully allot</l>
     <l n="374">To studies then familiar , since forgot ,</l>
     <l n="375">And cultivate a taste for ancient song ,</l>
     <l n="376">Catching its ardour as I mused along ;</l>
     <l n="377">Nor seldom , as propitious Heaven might send ,</l>
     <l n="378">What once I valued and could boast , a friend ,</l>
     <l n="379">Were witnesses how cordially I press 'd</l>
     <l n="380">His undissembling virtue to my breast ;</l>
     <l n="381">Receive me now , not uncorrupt as then</l>
     <l n="382">Nor guiltless of corrupting other men ,</l>
     <l n="383">But versed in arts that , while they seem to stay</l>
     <l n="384">A falling empire , hasten its decay .</l>
     <l n="385">To the fair haven of my native home ,</l>
     <l n="386">The wreck of what I was , fatigued , I come ;</l>
     <l n="387">For once I can approve the patriot 's voice ,</l>
     <l n="388">And make the course he recommends my choice :</l>
     <l n="389">We meet at last in one sincere desire ,</l>
     <l n="390">His wish and mine both prompt me to retire .</l>
     <l n="391">‘ Tis done — he steps into the welcome chaise ,</l>
     <l n="392">Lolls at his ease behind four handsome bays ,</l>
     <l n="393">That whirl away from business and debate</l>
     <l n="394">The disencumber 'd Atlas of the state .</l>
     <l n="395">Ask not the boy , who , when the breeze of morn</l>
     <l n="396">First shakes the glittering drops from every thorn ,</l>
     <l n="397">Unfolds his flock , then under bank or bush</l>
     <l n="398">Sits linking cherry-stones , or platting rush ,</l>
     <l n="399">How fair is Freedom ?— he was always free :</l>
     <l n="400">To carve his rustic name upon a tree ,</l>
     <l n="401">To snare the mole , or with ill-fashion 'd hook</l>
     <l n="402">To draw the incautious minnow from the brook ,</l>
     <l n="403">Are life 's prime pleasures in his simple view ,</l>
     <l n="404">His flock the chief concern he ever knew ;</l>
     <l n="405">She shines but little in his heedless eyes ,</l>
     <l n="406">The good we never miss we rarely prize :</l>
     <l n="407">But ask the noble drudge in state affairs ,</l>
     <l n="408">Escaped from office and its constant cares ,</l>
     <l n="409">What charms he sees in Freedom 's smile express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="410">In freedom lost so long , now repossess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="411">The tongue whose strains were cogent as commands ,</l>
     <l n="412">Revered at home , and felt in foreign lands ,</l>
     <l n="413">Shall own itself a stammerer in that cause ,</l>
     <l n="414">Or plead its silence as its best applause .</l>
     <l n="415">He knows indeed that , whether dress 'd or rude ,</l>
     <l n="416">Wild without art , or artfully subdued ,</l>
     <l n="417">Nature in every form inspires delight ,</l>
     <l n="418">But never mark 'd her with so just a sight .</l>
     <l n="419">Her hedge-row shrubs , a variegated store ,</l>
     <l n="420">With woodbine and wild roses mantled o'er ,</l>
     <l n="421">Green balks and furrow 'd lands , the stream that spreads</l>
     <l n="422">Its cooling vapour o'er the dewy meads ,</l>
     <l n="423">Downs , that almost escape the inquiring eye ,</l>
     <l n="424">That melt and fade into the distant sky ,</l>
     <l n="425">Beauties he lately slighted as he pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="426">Seem all created since he travell 'd last .</l>
     <l n="427">Master of all the enjoyments he design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="428">No rough annoyance rankling in his mind ,</l>
     <l n="429">What early philosophic hours he keeps ,</l>
     <l n="430">How regular his meals , how sound he sleeps !</l>
     <l n="431">Not sounder he that on the mainmast head ,</l>
     <l n="432">While morning kindles with a windy red ,</l>
     <l n="433">Begins a long look-out for distant land ,</l>
     <l n="434">Nor quits till evening watch his giddy stand ,</l>
     <l n="435">Then , swift descending with a seaman 's haste ,</l>
     <l n="436">Slips to his hammock , and forgets the blast .</l>
     <l n="437">He chooses company , but not the squire 's ,</l>
     <l n="438">Whose wit is rudeness , whose good breeding tires ;</l>
     <l n="439">Nor yet the parson 's , who would gladly come ,</l>
     <l n="440">Obsequious when abroad , though proud at home ;</l>
     <l n="441">Nor can he much affect the neighbouring peer ,</l>
     <l n="442">Whose toe of emulation treads too near ;</l>
     <l n="443">But wisely seeks a more convenient friend ,</l>
     <l n="444">With whom , dismissing forms , he may unbend .</l>
     <l n="445">A man , whom marks of condescending grace</l>
     <l n="446">Teach , while they flatter him , his proper place ;</l>
     <l n="447">Who comes when call 'd , and at a word withdraws ,</l>
     <l n="448">Speaks with reserve , and listens with applause ;</l>
     <l n="449">Some plain mechanic , who , without pretence</l>
     <l n="450">To birth or wit , nor gives nor takes offence ;</l>
     <l n="451">On whom he rests well pleased his weary powers ,</l>
     <l n="452">And talks and laughs away his vacant hours .</l>
     <l n="453">The tide of life , swift always in its course ,</l>
     <l n="454">May run in cities with a brisker force ,</l>
     <l n="455">But no where with a current so serene ,</l>
     <l n="456">Or half so clear , as in the rural scene .</l>
     <l n="457">Yet how fallacious is all earthly bliss ,</l>
     <l n="458">What obvious truths the wisest heads may miss ;</l>
     <l n="459">Some pleasures live a month , and some a year ,</l>
     <l n="460">But short the date of all we gather here ;</l>
     <l n="461">No happiness is felt , except the true ,</l>
     <l n="462">That does not charm thee more for being new .</l>
     <l n="463">This observation , as it chanced , not made ,</l>
     <l n="464">Or , if the thought occurr 'd , not duly weigh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="465">He sighs — for after all by slow degrees</l>
     <l n="466">The spot he loved has lost the power to please ;</l>
     <l n="467">To cross his ambling pony day by day</l>
     <l n="468">Seems at the best but dreaming life away ;</l>
     <l n="469">The prospect , such as might enchant despair ,</l>
     <l n="470">He views it not , or sees no beauty there ;</l>
     <l n="471">With aching heart , and discontented looks ,</l>
     <l n="472">Returns at noon to billiards or to books ,</l>
     <l n="473">But feels , while grasping at his faded joys ,</l>
     <l n="474">A secret thirst of his renounced employs .</l>
     <l n="475">He chides the tardiness of every post ,</l>
     <l n="476">Pants to be told of battles won or lost ,</l>
     <l n="477">Blames his own indolence , observes , though late ,</l>
     <l n="478">‘ Tis criminal to leave a sinking state ,</l>
     <l n="479">Flies to the levee , and , received with grace ,</l>
     <l n="480">Kneels , kisses hands , and shines again in place .</l>
     <l n="481">Suburban villas , highway-side retreats ,</l>
     <l n="482">That dread the encroachment of our growing streets ,</l>
     <l n="483">Tight boxes , neatly sash 'd , and in a blaze</l>
     <l n="484">With all a July sun 's collected rays ,</l>
     <l n="485">Delight the citizen , who , gasping there ,</l>
     <l n="486">Breathes clouds of dust , and calls it country air .</l>
     <l n="487">O sweet retirement , who would balk the thought</l>
     <l n="488">That could afford retirement , or could not ?</l>
     <l n="489">‘ Tis such an easy walk , so smooth and straight ,</l>
     <l n="490">The second milestone fronts the garden gate ;</l>
     <l n="491">A step if fair , and , if a shower approach ,</l>
     <l n="492">You find safe shelter in the next stage-coach .</l>
     <l n="493">There , prison 'd in a parlour snug and small ,</l>
     <l n="494">Like bottled wasps upon a southern wall ,</l>
     <l n="495">The man of business and his friends compress 'd</l>
     <l n="496">Forget their labours , and yet find no rest ;</l>
     <l n="497">But still ‘ tis rural — trees are to be seen</l>
     <l n="498">From every window , and the fields are green ;</l>
     <l n="499">Ducks paddle in the pond before the door ,</l>
     <l n="500">And what could a remoter scene show more ?</l>
     <l n="501">A sense of elegance we rarely find</l>
     <l n="502">The portion of a mean or vulgar mind ,</l>
     <l n="503">And ignorance of better things makes man ,</l>
     <l n="504">Who cannot much , rejoice in what he can ;</l>
     <l n="505">And he , that deems his leisure well bestow 'd</l>
     <l n="506">In contemplation of a turnpike-road ,</l>
     <l n="507">Is occupied as well , employs his hours</l>
     <l n="508">As wisely , and as much improves his powers ,</l>
     <l n="509">As he that slumbers in pavilions graced</l>
     <l n="510">With all the charms of an accomplish 'd taste .</l>
     <l n="511">Yet hence , alas ! insolvencies ; and hence</l>
     <l n="512">The unpitied victim of ill-judged expense ,</l>
     <l n="513">From all his wearisome engagements freed ,</l>
     <l n="514">Shakes hands with business , and retires indeed .</l>
     <l n="515">Your prudent grandmammas , ye modern belles ,</l>
     <l n="516">Content with Bristol , Bath , and Tunbridge Wells ,</l>
     <l n="517">When health required it , would consent to roam ,</l>
     <l n="518">Else more attach 'd to pleasures found at home ;</l>

     <l n="520">Ingenious to diversify dull life ,</l>
     <l n="521">In coaches , chaises , caravans , and hoys ,</l>
     <l n="522">Fly to the coast for daily , nightly joys ,</l>
     <l n="523">And all , impatient of dry land , agree</l>
     <l n="524">With one consent to rush into the sea .</l>
     <l n="525">Ocean exhibits , fathomless and broad ,</l>
     <l n="526">Much of the power and majesty of God .</l>
     <l n="527">He swathes about the swelling of the deep ,</l>
     <l n="528">That shines and rests , as infants smile and sleep ;</l>
     <l n="529">Vast as it is , it answers as it flows</l>
     <l n="530">The breathings of the lightest air that blows ;</l>
     <l n="531">Curling and whitening over all the waste ,</l>
     <l n="532">The rising waves obey the increasing blast ,</l>
     <l n="533">Abrupt and horrid as the tempest roars ,</l>
     <l n="534">Thunder and flash upon the stedfast shores ,</l>
     <l n="535">Till he that rides the whirlwind checks the rein ,</l>
     <l n="536">Then all the world of waters sleeps again .</l>
     <l n="537">Nereids or Dryads , as the fashion leads ,</l>
     <l n="538">Now in the floods , now panting in the meads ,</l>
     <l n="539">Votaries of pleasure still , where'er she dwells ,</l>
     <l n="540">Near barren rocks , in palaces , or cells ,</l>
     <l n="541">O grant a poet leave to recommend</l>

     <l n="545">Would ye , when rambling in your morning ride ,</l>
     <l n="546">With some unmeaning coxcomb at your side ,</l>
     <l n="547">Condemn the prattler for his idle pains ,</l>

     <l n="559">Anticipated rents and bills unpaid ,</l>

     <l n="561">Not to redeem his time , but his estate ,</l>
     <l n="562">And play the fool , but at a cheaper rate .</l>

     <l n="567">Nature indeed looks prettily , in rhyme ;</l>
     <l n="568">Streams tinkle sweetly in poetic chime :</l>
     <l n="569">The warblings of the blackbird , clear and strong ,</l>
     <l n="570">Are musical enough in Thomson 's song ;</l>
     <l n="571">And Cobham 's groves , and Windsor 's green retreats ,</l>
     <l n="572">When Pope describes them , have a thousand sweets ;</l>
     <l n="573">He likes the country , but in truth must own ,</l>
     <l n="574">Most likes it when he studies it in town .</l>
     <l n="575">Poor Jack — no matter who — for when I blame ,</l>
     <l n="576">I pity , and must therefore sink the name ,</l>
     <l n="577">Lived in his saddle , loved the chase , the course ,</l>
     <l n="578">And always , ere he mounted , kiss 'd his horse .</l>
     <l n="579">The estate , his sires had own 'd in ancient years ,</l>
     <l n="580">Was quickly distanced , match 'd against a peer 's .</l>
     <l n="581">Jack vanish 'd , was regretted , and forgot ;</l>
     <l n="582">‘ Tis wild good-nature 's never failing lot .</l>
     <l n="583">At length , when all had long supposed him dead ,</l>
     <l n="584">By cold submersion , razor , rope , or lead ,</l>
     <l n="585">My lord , alighting at his usual place ,</l>
     <l n="586">The Crown , took notice of an ostler 's face .</l>
     <l n="587">Jack knew his friend , but hoped in that disguise</l>
     <l n="588">He might escape the most observing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="589">And whistling , as if unconcern 'd and gay ,</l>
     <l n="590">Curried his nag and looked another way ;</l>
     <l n="591">Convinced at last , upon a nearer view ,</l>
     <l n="592">‘ Twas he , the same , the very Jack he knew ,</l>
     <l n="593">O'erwhelm ' d at once with wonder , grief , and joy ,</l>
     <l n="594">He press 'd him much to quit his base employ ;</l>
     <l n="595">His countenance , his purse , his heart , his hand ,</l>
     <l n="596">Influence and power , were all at his command :</l>
     <l n="597">Peers are not always generous as well bred ,</l>
     <l n="598">But Granby was , meant truly what he said .</l>
     <l n="599">Jack bow 'd , and was obliged — confess 'd ‘ twas strange ,</l>
     <l n="600">That so retired he should not wish a change ,</l>
     <l n="601">But knew no medium between guzzling beer ,</l>
     <l n="602">And his old stint — three thousand pounds a year .</l>
     <l n="603">Thus some retire to nourish hopeless woe ;</l>
     <l n="604">Some seeking happiness not found below ;</l>
     <l n="605">Some to comply with humour , and a mind</l>
     <l n="606">To social scenes by nature disinclined ;</l>
     <l n="607">Some sway 'd by fashion , some by deep disgust ;</l>
     <l n="608">Some self-impoverish 'd , and because they must ;</l>
     <l n="609">But few , that court Retirement , are aware</l>
     <l n="610">Of half the toils they must encounter there .</l>
     <l n="611">Lucrative offices are seldom lost</l>
     <l n="612">For want of powers proportion 'd to the post :</l>
     <l n="613">Give e'en a dunce the employment he desires ,</l>
     <l n="614">And he soon finds the talents it requires ;</l>
     <l n="615">A business with an income at its heels</l>
     <l n="616">Furnishes always oil for its own wheels .</l>
     <l n="617">But in his arduous enterprise to close</l>
     <l n="618">His active years with indolent repose ,</l>
     <l n="619">He finds the labours of that state exceed</l>
     <l n="620">His utmost faculties , severe indeed .</l>
     <l n="621">‘ Tis easy to resign a toilsome place ,</l>
     <l n="622">But not to manage leisure with a grace ;</l>
     <l n="623">Absence of occupation is not rest ,</l>
     <l n="624">A mind quite vacant is a mind distress 'd .</l>
     <l n="625">The veteran steed , excused his task at length ,</l>
     <l n="626">In kind compassion of his failing strength ,</l>
     <l n="627">And turn 'd into the park or mead to graze ,</l>
     <l n="628">Exempt from future service all his days ,</l>
     <l n="629">There feels a pleasure perfect in its kind ,</l>
     <l n="630">Ranges at liberty , and snuffs the wind :</l>
     <l n="631">But when his lord would quit the busy road ,</l>
     <l n="632">To taste a joy like that he has bestow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="633">He proves , less happy than his favour 'd brute ,</l>
     <l n="634">A life of ease a difficult pursuit .</l>
     <l n="635">Thought , to the man that never thinks , may seem</l>
     <l n="636">As natural as when asleep to dream ;</l>
     <l n="637">But reveries ( for human minds will act )</l>
     <l n="638">Specious in show , impossible in fact ,</l>
     <l n="639">Those flimsy webs , that break as soon as wrought ,</l>
     <l n="640">Attain not to the dignity of thought :</l>
     <l n="641">Nor yet the swarms that occupy the brain ,</l>
     <l n="642">Where dreams of dress , intrigue , and pleasure reign ;</l>
     <l n="643">Nor such as useless conversation breeds ,</l>
     <l n="644">Or lust engenders , and indulgence feeds .</l>

   <p>THE TASK . BOOK I .</p>
   <p>THE SOFA .</p>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>The history of the following production is briefly this : A lady , fond of blank verse , demanded a poem of that kind from the author , and gave him the Sofa for a subject . He obeyed ; and having much leisure , connected another subject with it ; and , pursuing the train of thought to which his situation and turn of mind led him , brought forth at length , instead of the trifle which he at first intended , a serious affair — a volume .</p>
   <p>In the poem on the subject of Education he would be very sorry to stand suspected of having aimed his censure at any particular school . His objections are such as naturally apply themselves to schools in general . If there were not , as for the most part there is , wilful neglect in those who manage them , and an omission even of such discipline as they are susceptible of , the objects are yet too numerous for minute attention ; and the aching hearts of ten thousand parents , mourning under the bitterest of all disappointments , attest the truth of the allegation . His quarrel therefore is with the mischief at large , and not with any particular instance of it .</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Historical deduction of seats , from the stool to the sofa — A schoolboy 's ramble — A walk in the country — The scene described — Rural sounds as well as sights delightful — Another walk — Mistake concerning the charms of solitude corrected — Colonnades commended — Alcove , and the view from it — The wilderness — The Grove — The Thresher — The necessity and the benefits of exercise — The works of nature superior to , and in some instances inimitable by , art — The wearisomeness of what is commonly called a life of pleasure — Change of scene sometimes expedient — A common described , and the character of crazy Kate introduced — Gipsies — The blessings of civilized life — That state most favourable to virtue — The South Sea islanders compassionated , but chiefly Omai — His present state of mind supposed — Civilized life friendly to virtue , but not great cities — Great cities , and London in particular , allowed their due praise , but censured — Fête champêtre — The book concludes with a reflection on the effects of dissipation and effeminacy upon our public measures .</head>

     <l n="1">I Sing the Sofa . I who lately sang</l>
     <l n="2">Truth , Hope , and Charity ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 805 ]</span>and touch 'd with awe</l>
     <l n="3">The solemn chords , and with a trembling hand ,</l>
     <l n="4">Escaped with pain from that adventurous flight ,</l>
     <l n="5">Now seek repose upon an humbler theme ;</l>
     <l n="6">The theme though humble , yet august and proud</l>
     <l n="7">The occasion — for the Fair commands the song .</l>
     <l n="8">Time was , when clothing sumptuous or for use ,</l>
     <l n="9">Save their own painted skins , our sires had none .</l>
     <l n="10">As yet black breeches were not ; satin smooth ,</l>
     <l n="11">Or velvet soft , or plush with shaggy pile :</l>
     <l n="12">The hardy chief upon the rugged rock ,</l>
     <l n="13">Wash 'd by the sea , or on the gravelly bank</l>
     <l n="14">Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud ,</l>
     <l n="15">Fearless of wrong , reposed his weary strength .</l>
     <l n="16">Those barbarous ages past , succeeded next</l>
     <l n="17">The birthday of Invention ; weak at first ,</l>
     <l n="18">Dull in design , and clumsy to perform .</l>
     <l n="19">Joint-stools were then created ; on three legs</l>
     <l n="20">Upborne they stood . Three legs upholding firm</l>
     <l n="21">A massy slab , in fashion square or round .</l>
     <l n="22">On such a stool immortal Alfred sat ,</l>
     <l n="23">And sway 'd the sceptre of his infant realms :</l>
     <l n="24">And such in ancient halls and mansions drear</l>
     <l n="25">May still be seen ; but perforated sore ,</l>
     <l n="26">And drill 'd in holes , the solid oak is found ,</l>
     <l n="27">By worms voracious eating through and through .</l>
     <l n="28">At length a generation more refined</l>
     <l n="29">Improv 'd the simple plan ; made three legs four ,</l>
     <l n="30">Gave them a twisted form vermicular ,</l>
     <l n="31">And o'er the seat , with plenteous wadding stuff 'd ,</l>
     <l n="32">Induced a splendid cover , green and blue ,</l>
     <l n="33">Yellow and red , of tapestry richly wrought</l>
     <l n="34">And woven close , or needlework sublime .</l>
     <l n="35">There might ye see the piony spread wide ,</l>
     <l n="36">The full blown rose , the shepherd and his lass ,</l>
     <l n="37">Lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes ,</l>
     <l n="38">And parrots with twin cherries in their beak .</l>
     <l n="39">Now came the cane from India , smooth and bright</l>
     <l n="40">With Nature 's varnish , sever 'd into stripes</l>
     <l n="41">That interlaced each other , these supplied</l>
     <l n="42">Of texture firm a lattice work , that braced</l>
     <l n="43">The new machine , and it became a chair .</l>
     <l n="44">But restless was the chair ; the back erect</l>
     <l n="45">Distress 'd the weary loins , that felt no ease ;</l>
     <l n="46">The slippery seat betray 'd the sliding part</l>
     <l n="47">That press 'd it , and the feet hung dangling down ,</l>
     <l n="48">Anxious in vain to find the distant floor .</l>
     <l n="49">These for the rich ; the rest , whom Fate had placed</l>
     <l n="50">In modest mediocrity , content</l>
     <l n="51">With base materials , sat on well tann 'd hides ,</l>
     <l n="52">Obdurate and unyielding , glassy smooth ,</l>
     <l n="53">With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn ,</l>
     <l n="54">Or scarlet crewel , in the cushion fix 'd ,</l>
     <l n="55">If cushion might be call 'd , what harder seem 'd</l>
     <l n="56">Than the firm oak of which the frame was form 'd .</l>
     <l n="57">No want of timber then was felt or fear 'd</l>
     <l n="58">In Albion 's happy isle . The lumber stood</l>
     <l n="59">Ponderous and fix 'd by its own massy weight .</l>
     <l n="60">But elbows still were wanting ; these , some say ,</l>
     <l n="61">An alderman of Cripplegate contrived ;</l>
     <l n="62">And some inscribe the invention to a priest ,</l>
     <l n="63">Burly and big , and studious of his ease .</l>
     <l n="64">But , rude at first , and not with easy slope</l>
     <l n="65">Receding wide , they pressed against the ribs ,</l>
     <l n="66">And bruised the side ; and , elevated high ,</l>
     <l n="67">Taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears .</l>
     <l n="68">Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires</l>
     <l n="69">Complain 'd , though incommodiously pent in ,</l>
     <l n="70">And ill at ease behind . The ladies first</l>
     <l n="71">‘ Gan murmur , as became the softer sex .</l>
     <l n="72">Ingenious Fancy , never better pleased</l>
     <l n="73">Than when employed to accommodate the fair ,</l>
     <l n="74">Heard the sweet moan with pity , and devised</l>
     <l n="75">The soft settee ; one elbow at each end ,</l>
     <l n="76">And in the midst an elbow it received ,</l>
     <l n="77">United yet divided , twain at once .</l>
     <l n="78">So sit two kings of Brentford on one throne ;</l>
     <l n="79">And so two citizens , who take the air ,</l>
     <l n="80">Close pack 'd , and smiling , in a chaise and one .</l>
     <l n="81">But relaxation of the languid frame ,</l>
     <l n="82">By soft recumbency of outstretch 'd limbs ,</l>
     <l n="83">Was bliss reserved for happier days . So slow</l>
     <l n="84">The growth of what is excellent ; so hard</l>
     <l n="85">To attain perfection in this nether world .</l>
     <l n="86">Thus first Necessity invented stools ,</l>
     <l n="87">Convenience next suggested elbow-chairs ,</l>
     <l n="88">And Luxury the accomplish 'd SOFA last .</l>
     <l n="89">The nurse sleeps sweetly , hired to watch the sick ,</l>
     <l n="90">Whom snoring she disturbs . As sweetly he</l>
     <l n="91">Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour ,</l>
     <l n="92">To sleep within the carriage more secure ,</l>
     <l n="93">His legs depending at the open door .</l>
     <l n="94">Sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk ,</l>
     <l n="95">The tedious rector drawling o'er his head ;</l>
     <l n="96">And sweet the clerk below . But neither sleep</l>
     <l n="97">Of lazy nurse , who snores the sick man dead ,</l>
     <l n="98">Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour ,</l>
     <l n="99">To slumber in the carriage more secure ,</l>
     <l n="100">Nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk ,</l>
     <l n="101">Nor yet the dozings of the clerk , are sweet ,</l>
     <l n="102">Compared with the repose the Sofa yields .</l>
     <l n="103">Oh may I live exempted ( while I live</l>
     <l n="104">Guiltless of pampered appetite obscene )</l>
     <l n="105">From pangs arthritic , that infest the toe</l>
     <l n="106">Of libertine Excess ! The Sofa suits</l>
     <l n="107">The gouty limb , ‘ tis true ; but gouty limb ,</l>
     <l n="108">Though on a Sofa , may I never feel :</l>
     <l n="109">For I have loved the rural walk through lanes</l>
     <l n="110">Of grassy swarth , close cropp 'd by nibbling sheep ,</l>
     <l n="111">And skirted thick with intertexture firm</l>
     <l n="112">Of thorny boughs ; have loved the rural walk</l>
     <l n="113">O'er hills , through valleys , and by rivers ’ brink ,</l>
     <l n="114">E'er since a truant boy I pass 'd my bounds</l>
     <l n="115">To enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames ;</l>
     <l n="116">And still remember , nor without regret</l>
     <l n="117">Of hours that sorrow since has much endear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="118">How oft , my slice of pocket store consumed ,</l>
     <l n="119">Still hungering , pennyless , and far from home ,</l>
     <l n="120">I fed on scarlet hips and stony haws ,</l>
     <l n="121">Or blushing crabs , or berries , that emboss</l>
     <l n="122">The bramble , black as jet , or sloes austere .</l>
     <l n="123">Hard fare ! but such as boyish appetite</l>
     <l n="124">Disdains not ; nor the palate , undepraved</l>
     <l n="125">By culinary arts , unsavoury deems .</l>
     <l n="126">No Sofa then awaited my return ;</l>
     <l n="127">Nor Sofa then I needed . Youth repairs</l>
     <l n="128">His wasted spirits quickly , by long toil</l>
     <l n="129">Incurring short fatigue ; and though our years ,</l>
     <l n="130">As life declines , speed rapidly away ,</l>
     <l n="131">And not a year but pilfers as he goes</l>
     <l n="132">Some youthful grace , that age would gladly keep ;</l>
     <l n="133">A tooth or auburn lock , and by degrees</l>
     <l n="134">Their length and colour from the locks they spare ;</l>
     <l n="135">The elastic spring of an unwearied foot ,</l>
     <l n="136">That mounts the stile with ease , or leaps the fence ,</l>
     <l n="137">That play of lungs , inhaling and again</l>
     <l n="138">Respiring freely the fresh air , that makes</l>
     <l n="139">Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me ,</l>
     <l n="140">Mine have not pilfer 'd yet ; nor yet impair 'd</l>
     <l n="141">My relish of fair prospect ; scenes that soothed</l>
     <l n="142">Or charm 'd me young , no longer young , I find</l>
     <l n="143">Still soothing , and of power to charm me still .</l>
     <l n="144">And witness , dear companion of my walks ,</l>
     <l n="145">Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive</l>
     <l n="146">Fast lock 'd in mine , with pleasure such as love ,</l>
     <l n="147">Confirm 'd by long experience of thy worth ,</l>
     <l n="148">And well-tried virtues , could alone inspire —</l>
     <l n="149">Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long .</l>
     <l n="150">Thou know'st my praise of nature most sincere ,</l>
     <l n="151">And that my raptures are not conjured up</l>
     <l n="152">To serve occasions of poetic pomp ,</l>
     <l n="153">But genuine , and art partner of them all .</l>
     <l n="154">How oft upon yon eminence our pace</l>
     <l n="155">Has slacken 'd to a pause , and we have borne</l>
     <l n="156">The ruffling wind , scarce conscious that it blew ,</l>
     <l n="157">While Admiration , feeding at the eye ,</l>
     <l n="158">And still unsated , dwelt upon the scene .</l>
     <l n="159">Thence with what pleasure have we just discern 'd</l>
     <l n="160">The distant plough slow moving , and beside</l>
     <l n="161">His labouring team , that swerv 'd not from the track ,</l>
     <l n="162">The sturdy swain diminish 'd to a boy !</l>
     <l n="163">Here Ouse , slow winding through a level plain</l>
     <l n="164">Of spacious meads , with cattle sprinkled o'er ,</l>
     <l n="165">Conducts the eye along his sinuous course</l>
     <l n="166">Delighted . There , fast rooted in their bank ,</l>
     <l n="167">Stand , never overlook 'd , our favourite elms ,</l>
     <l n="168">That screen the herdsman 's solitary hut ;</l>
     <l n="169">While far beyond , and overthwart the stream ,</l>
     <l n="170">That , as with molten glass , inlays the vale ,</l>
     <l n="171">The sloping land recedes into the clouds ;</l>
     <l n="172">Displaying on its varied side the grace</l>
     <l n="173">Of hedge-row beauties numberless , square tower ,</l>
     <l n="174">Tall spire , from which the sound of cheerful bells</l>
     <l n="175">Just undulates upon the listening ear ,</l>
     <l n="176">Groves , heaths , and smoking villages , remote .</l>
     <l n="177">Scenes must be beautiful which , daily view 'd ,</l>
     <l n="178">Please daily , and whose novelty survives</l>
     <l n="179">Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years —</l>
     <l n="180">Praise justly due to those that I describe .</l>
     <l n="181">Nor rural sights alone , but rural sounds ,</l>
     <l n="182">Exhilarate the spirit , and restore</l>
     <l n="183">The tone of languid Nature . Mighty winds ,</l>
     <l n="184">That sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood</l>
     <l n="185">Of ancient growth , make music not unlike</l>
     <l n="186">The dash of Ocean on his winding shore ,</l>
     <l n="187">And lull the spirit while they fill the mind ;</l>
     <l n="188">Unnumber 'd branches waving in the blast ,</l>
     <l n="189">And all their leaves fast fluttering , all at once .</l>
     <l n="190">Nor less composure waits upon the roar</l>
     <l n="191">Of distant floods , or on the softer voice</l>
     <l n="192">Of neighbouring fountain , or of rills that slip</l>
     <l n="193">Through the cleft rock , and , chiming as they fall</l>
     <l n="194">Upon loose pebbles , lose themselves at length</l>
     <l n="195">In matted grass , that with a livelier green</l>
     <l n="196">Betrays the secret of their silent course .</l>
     <l n="197">Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds ,</l>
     <l n="198">But animated nature sweeter still ,</l>
     <l n="199">To soothe and satisfy the human ear .</l>
     <l n="200">Ten thousand warblers cheer the day , and one</l>
     <l n="201">The livelong night : nor these alone , whose notes</l>
     <l n="202">Nice-finger 'd Art must emulate in vain ,</l>
     <l n="203">But cawing rooks , and kites that swim sublime</l>
     <l n="204">In still-repeated circles , screaming loud ,</l>
     <l n="205">The jay , the pie , and e'en the boding owl ,</l>
     <l n="206">That hails the rising moon , have charms for me .</l>
     <l n="207">Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh ,</l>
     <l n="208">Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns ,</l>
     <l n="209">And only there , please highly for their sake .</l>
     <l n="210">Peace to the artist , whose ingenious thought</l>
     <l n="211">Devised the weather-house , that useful toy !</l>
     <l n="212">Fearless of humid air and gathering rains ,</l>
     <l n="213">Forth steps the man — an emblem of myself !</l>
     <l n="214">More delicate his timorous mate retires .</l>
     <l n="215">When Winter soaks the fields , and female feet ,</l>
     <l n="216">Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay ,</l>
     <l n="217">Or ford the rivulets , are best at home ,</l>
     <l n="218">The task of new discoveries falls on me .</l>
     <l n="219">At such a season , and with such a charge ,</l>
     <l n="220">Once went I forth ; and found , till then unknown ,</l>
     <l n="221">A cottage , whither oft we since repair :</l>
     <l n="222">‘ Tis perched upon the green hill top , but close</l>
     <l n="223">Environ 'd with a ring of branching elms ,</l>
     <l n="224">That overhang the thatch , itself unseen</l>
     <l n="225">Peeps at the vale below ; so thick beset</l>
     <l n="226">With foliage of such dark redundant growth ,</l>
     <l n="227">I call 'd the low-roof 'd lodge the peasant 's nest .</l>
     <l n="228">And , hidden as it is , and far remote</l>
     <l n="229">From such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear</l>
     <l n="230">In village or in town , the bay of curs</l>
     <l n="231">Incessant , clinking hammers , grinding wheels ,</l>
     <l n="232">And infants clamorous whether pleased or pain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="233">Oft have I wish 'd the peaceful covert mine .</l>
     <l n="234">Here , I have said , at least I should possess</l>
     <l n="235">The poet 's treasure , silence , and indulge</l>
     <l n="236">The dreams of fancy , tranquil and secure .</l>
     <l n="237">Vain thought ! the dweller in that still retreat</l>
     <l n="238">Dearly obtains the refuge it affords .</l>
     <l n="239">Its elevated site forbids the wretch</l>
     <l n="240">To drink sweet waters of the crystal well ;</l>
     <l n="241">He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch ,</l>
     <l n="242">And , heavy laden , brings his beverage home ,</l>
     <l n="243">Far fetch 'd and little worth ; nor seldom waits ,</l>
     <l n="244">Dependent on the baker 's punctual call ,</l>
     <l n="245">To hear his creaking panniers at the door ,</l>
     <l n="246">Angry and sad , and his last crust consumed .</l>
     <l n="247">So farewell envy of the peasant 's nest !</l>
     <l n="248">If solitude make scant the means of life ,</l>
     <l n="249">Society for me !— thou seeming sweet ,</l>
     <l n="250">Be still a pleasing object in my view ;</l>
     <l n="251">My visit still , but never mine abode .</l>
     <l n="252">Not distant far , a length of colonnade</l>
     <l n="253">Invites us . Monument of ancient taste ,</l>
     <l n="254">Now scorn 'd , but worthy of a better fate .</l>
     <l n="255">Our fathers knew the value of a screen</l>
     <l n="256">From sultry suns ; and , in their shaded walks</l>
     <l n="257">And long protracted bowers , enjoyed at noon</l>
     <l n="258">The gloom and coolness of declining day .</l>
     <l n="259">We bear our shades about us ; self-deprived</l>
     <l n="260">Of other screen , the thin umbrella spread ,</l>
     <l n="261">And range an Indian waste without a tree .</l>
     <l n="262">Thanks to Benevolus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 806 ]</span>he spares me yet</l>
     <l n="263">These chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines ;</l>
     <l n="264">And , though himself so polished , still reprieves</l>
     <l n="265">The obsolete prolixity of shade .</l>
     <l n="266">Descending now ,— but cautious , lest too fast ,—</l>
     <l n="267">A sudden steep upon a rustic bridge ,</l>
     <l n="268">We pass a gulf , in which the willows dip</l>
     <l n="269">Their pendent boughs , stooping as if to drink .</l>
     <l n="270">Hence , ankle-deep in moss and flowery thyme ,</l>
     <l n="271">We mount again , and feel at every step</l>
     <l n="272">Our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft ,</l>
     <l n="273">Raised by the mole , the miner of the soil .</l>
     <l n="274">He , not unlike the great ones of mankind ,</l>
     <l n="275">Disfigures earth : and , plotting in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="276">Toils much to earn a monumental pile ,</l>
     <l n="277">That may record the mischiefs he has done .</l>
     <l n="278">The summit gain 'd , behold the proud alcove</l>
     <l n="279">That crowns it ! yet not all its pride secures</l>
     <l n="280">The grand retreat from injuries impress 'd</l>
     <l n="281">By rural carvers , who with knives deface</l>
     <l n="282">The panels , leaving an obscure , rude name ,</l>
     <l n="283">In characters uncouth , and spelt amiss .</l>
     <l n="284">So strong the zeal to immortalize himself</l>
     <l n="285">Beats in the breast of man , that e'en a few ,</l>
     <l n="286">Few transient years , won from the abyss abhorr 'd</l>
     <l n="287">Of blank oblivion , seem a glorious prize ,</l>
     <l n="288">And even to a clown . Now roves the eye ;</l>
     <l n="289">And , posted on this speculative height ,</l>
     <l n="290">Exults in its command . The sheepfold here</l>
     <l n="291">Pours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe .</l>
     <l n="292">At first , progressive as a stream , they seek</l>
     <l n="293">The middle field ; but , scatter 'd by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="294">Each to his choice , soon whiten all the land .</l>
     <l n="295">There from the sun-burnt hay-field homeward creeps</l>
     <l n="296">The loaded wain ; while , lighten 'd of its charge ,</l>
     <l n="297">The wain that meets it passes swiftly by ;</l>
     <l n="298">The boorish driver leaning o'er his team</l>
     <l n="299">Vociferous and impatient of delay .</l>
     <l n="300">Nor less attractive is the woodland scene ,</l>
     <l n="301">Diversified with trees of every growth ,</l>
     <l n="302">Alike , yet various . Here the grey smooth trunks</l>
     <l n="303">Of ash , or lime , or beech , distinctly shine ,</l>
     <l n="304">Within the twilight of their distant shades ;</l>
     <l n="305">There , lost behind a rising ground , the wood</l>
     <l n="306">Seems sunk , and shorten 'd to its topmost boughs .</l>
     <l n="307">No tree in all the grove but has its charms ,</l>
     <l n="308">Though each its hue peculiar ; paler some ,</l>
     <l n="309">And of a wannish grey ; the willow such ,</l>
     <l n="310">And poplar , that with silver lines his leaf ,</l>
     <l n="311">And ash far stretching his umbrageous arm ;</l>
     <l n="312">Of deeper green the elm ; and deeper still ,</l>
     <l n="313">Lord of the woods , the long surviving oak .</l>
     <l n="314">Some glossy-leaved , and shining in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="315">The maple , and the beech of oily nuts</l>
     <l n="316">Prolific , and the lime at dewy eve</l>
     <l n="317">Diffusing odours : nor unnoted pass</l>
     <l n="318">The sycamore , capricious in attire ,</l>
     <l n="319">Now green , now tawny , and , ere autumn yet</l>
     <l n="320">Have changed the woods , in scarlet honours bright .</l>
     <l n="321">O'er these , but far beyond ( a spacious map</l>
     <l n="322">Of hill and valley interposed between ) ,</l>
     <l n="323">The Ouse , dividing the well water 'd land ,</l>
     <l n="324">Now glitters in the sun , and now retires ,</l>
     <l n="325">As bashful , yet impatient to be seen .</l>
     <l n="326">Hence the declivity is sharp and short ,</l>
     <l n="327">And such the re-ascent ; between them weeps</l>
     <l n="328">A little naiad her impoverish 'd urn</l>
     <l n="329">All summer long , which winter fills again .</l>
     <l n="330">The folded gates would bar my progress now ,</l>
     <l n="331">But that the lord<span type="note_anchor">[ 806 ]</span>enclosed demesne ,</l>
     <l n="332">Communicative of the good he owns ,</l>
     <l n="333">Admits me to a share : the guiltless eye</l>
     <l n="334">Commits no wrong , nor wastes what it enjoys .</l>
     <l n="335">Refreshing change ! where now the blazing sun ?</l>
     <l n="336">By short transition we have lost his glare ,</l>
     <l n="337">And stepp 'd at once into a cooler clime .</l>
     <l n="338">Ye fallen avenues ! once more I mourn</l>
     <l n="339">Your fate unmerited , once more rejoice</l>
     <l n="340">That yet a remnant of your race survives .</l>
     <l n="341">How airy and how light the graceful arch ,</l>
     <l n="342">Yet awful as the consecrated roof</l>
     <l n="343">Re-echoing pious anthems ! while beneath</l>
     <l n="344">The chequer 'd earth seems restless as a flood</l>
     <l n="345">Brush 'd by the wind . So sportive is the light</l>
     <l n="346">Shot through the boughs , it dances as they dance ,</l>
     <l n="347">Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick ,</l>
     <l n="348">And darkening and enlightening , as the leaves</l>
     <l n="349">Play wanton , every moment , every spot .</l>
     <l n="350">And now , with nerves new braced and spirits cheer 'd ,</l>
     <l n="351">We tread the wilderness , whose well roll 'd walks ,</l>
     <l n="352">With curvature of slow and easy sweep —</l>
     <l n="353">Deception innocent — give ample space</l>
     <l n="354">To narrow bounds . The grove receives us next ;</l>
     <l n="355">Between the upright shafts of whose tall elms</l>
     <l n="356">We may discern the thresher at his task .</l>
     <l n="357">Thump after thump resounds the constant flail ,</l>
     <l n="358">That seems to swing uncertain , and yet falls</l>
     <l n="359">Full on the destined ear . Wide flies the chaff ;</l>
     <l n="360">The rustling straw sends up a frequent mist</l>
     <l n="361">Of atoms , sparkling in the noonday beam .</l>
     <l n="362">Come hither , ye that press your beds of down</l>
     <l n="363">And sleep not ; see him sweating o'er his bread</l>
     <l n="364">Before he eats it .— ‘ Tis the primal curse ,</l>
     <l n="365">But soften 'd into mercy ; made the pledge</l>
     <l n="366">Of cheerful days , and nights without a groan .</l>
     <l n="367">By ceaseless action all that is subsists .</l>
     <l n="368">Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel</l>
     <l n="369">That Nature rides upon maintains her health ,</l>
     <l n="370">Her beauty , her fertility . She dreads</l>
     <l n="371">An instant 's pause , and lives but while she moves .</l>
     <l n="372">Its own revolvency upholds the world .</l>
     <l n="373">Winds from all quarters agitate the air ,</l>
     <l n="374">And fit the limpid element for use ,</l>
     <l n="375">Else noxious : oceans , rivers , lakes , and streams ,</l>
     <l n="376">All feel the freshening impulse , and are cleansed</l>
     <l n="377">By restless undulation : e'en the oak</l>
     <l n="378">Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm :</l>
     <l n="379">He seems indeed indignant , and to feel</l>
     <l n="380">The impression of the blast with proud disdain ,</l>
     <l n="381">Frowning , as if in his unconscious arm</l>
     <l n="382">He held the thunder : but the monarch owes</l>
     <l n="383">His firm stability to what he scorns —</l>
     <l n="384">More fix 'd below , the more disturb 'd above .</l>
     <l n="385">The law , by which all creatures else are bound ,</l>
     <l n="386">Binds man , the lord of all . Himself derives</l>
     <l n="387">No mean advantage from a kindred cause ,</l>
     <l n="388">From strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease .</l>
     <l n="389">The sedentary stretch their lazy length</l>
     <l n="390">When custom bids , but no refreshment find ,</l>
     <l n="391">For none they need : the languid eye , the cheek</l>
     <l n="392">Deserted of its bloom , the flaccid , shrunk ,</l>
     <l n="393">And wither 'd muscle , and the vapid soul ,</l>
     <l n="394">Reproach their owner with that love of rest</l>
     <l n="395">To which he forfeits e'en the rest he loves .</l>
     <l n="396">Not such the alert and active . Measure life</l>
     <l n="397">By its true worth , the comforts it affords ,</l>
     <l n="398">And theirs alone seems worthy of the name .</l>
     <l n="399">Good health , and , its associate in the most ,</l>
     <l n="400">Good temper : spirits prompt to undertake ,</l>
     <l n="401">And not soon spent , though in an arduous task ;</l>
     <l n="402">The powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs ;</l>
     <l n="403">E'en age itself seems privileged in them ,</l>
     <l n="404">With clear exemption from its own defects .</l>
     <l n="405">A sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front</l>
     <l n="406">The veteran shows , and , gracing a grey beard</l>
     <l n="407">With youthful smiles , descends toward the grave</l>
     <l n="408">Sprightly , and old almost without decay .</l>
     <l n="409">Like a coy maiden , Ease , when courted most ,</l>
     <l n="410">Farthest retires — an idol , at whose shrine</l>
     <l n="411">Who oftenest sacrifice are favour 'd least .</l>
     <l n="412">The love of Nature and the scenes she draws</l>
     <l n="413">Is Nature 's dictate . Strange ! there should be found ,</l>
     <l n="414">Who , self-imprison 'd in their proud saloons ,</l>
     <l n="415">Renounce the odours of the open field</l>
     <l n="416">For the unscented fictions of the loom ;</l>
     <l n="417">Who , satisfied with only pencil 'd scenes ,</l>
     <l n="418">Prefer to the performance of a God</l>
     <l n="419">The inferior wonders of an artist 's hand !</l>
     <l n="420">Lovely indeed the mimic works of Art ;</l>
     <l n="421">But Nature 's works far lovelier . I admire ,</l>
     <l n="422">None more admires , the painter 's magic skill ,</l>
     <l n="423">Who shows me that which I shall never see ,</l>
     <l n="424">Conveys a distant country into mine ,</l>
     <l n="425">And throws Italian light on English walls .</l>
     <l n="426">But imitative strokes can do no more</l>
     <l n="427">Than please the eye — sweet Nature every sense .</l>
     <l n="428">The air salubrious of her lofty hills ,</l>
     <l n="429">The cheering fragrance of her dewy vales ,</l>
     <l n="430">And music of her woods — no works of man</l>
     <l n="431">May rival these ; these all bespeak a power</l>
     <l n="432">Peculiar , and exclusively her own .</l>
     <l n="433">Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast ;</l>
     <l n="434">‘ Tis free to all — ‘ tis every day renew 'd ;</l>
     <l n="435">Who scorns it starves deservedly at home .</l>
     <l n="436">He does not scorn it , who , imprison 'd long</l>
     <l n="437">In some unwholesome dungeon , and a prey</l>
     <l n="438">To sallow sickness , which the vapours , dank</l>
     <l n="439">And clammy , of his dark abode have bred ,</l>
     <l n="440">Escapes at last to liberty and light :</l>
     <l n="441">His cheek recovers soon its healthful hue ;</l>
     <l n="442">His eye relumines its extinguish 'd fires ;</l>
     <l n="443">He walks , he leaps , he runs — is wing 'd with joy ,</l>
     <l n="444">And riots in the sweets of every breeze .</l>
     <l n="445">He does not scorn it , who has long endured</l>
     <l n="446">A fever 's agonies , and fed on drugs .</l>
     <l n="447">Nor yet the mariner , his blood inflamed</l>
     <l n="448">With acrid salts ; his very heart athirst</l>
     <l n="449">To gaze at Nature in her green array ,</l>
     <l n="450">Upon the ship 's tall side he stands , possess 'd</l>
     <l n="451">With visions prompted by intense desire :</l>
     <l n="452">Fair fields appear below , such as he left</l>
     <l n="453">Far distant , such as he would die to find —</l>
     <l n="454">He seeks them headlong , and is seen no more .</l>
     <l n="455">The spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns ;</l>
     <l n="456">The lowering eye , the petulance , the frown ,</l>
     <l n="457">And sullen sadness , that o'ershade , distort ,</l>
     <l n="458">And mar the face of beauty , when no cause</l>
     <l n="459">For such immeasurable woe appears ,</l>
     <l n="460">These Flora banishes , and gives the fair</l>
     <l n="461">Sweet smiles , and bloom less transient than her own .</l>
     <l n="462">It is the constant revolution , stale</l>
     <l n="463">And tasteless , of the same repeated joys ,</l>
     <l n="464">That palls and satiates , and makes languid life</l>
     <l n="465">A pedlar 's pack , that bows the bearer down .</l>
     <l n="466">Health suffers , and the spirits ebb ; the heart</l>
     <l n="467">Recoils from its own choice — at the full feast</l>
     <l n="468">Is famish 'd — finds no music in the song ,</l>
     <l n="469">No smartness in the jest ; and wonders why .</l>
     <l n="470">Yet thousands still desire to journey on ,</l>
     <l n="471">Though halt , and weary of the path they tread .</l>
     <l n="472">The paralytic , who can hold her cards ,</l>
     <l n="473">But cannot play them , borrows a friend 's hand</l>
     <l n="474">To deal and shuffle , to divide and sort</l>
     <l n="475">Her mingled suits and sequences ; and sits ,</l>
     <l n="476">Spectatress both and spectacle , a sad</l>
     <l n="477">And silent cipher , while her proxy plays .</l>
     <l n="478">Others are dragg 'd into the crowded room</l>
     <l n="479">Between supporters ; and , once seated , sits ,</l>
     <l n="480">Through downright inability to rise ,</l>
     <l n="481">Till the stout bearers lift the corpse again .</l>
     <l n="482">These speak a loud memento . Yet e'en these</l>
     <l n="483">Themselves love life , and cling to it , as he</l>
     <l n="484">That overhangs a torrent to a twig .</l>
     <l n="485">They love it , and yet loathe it ; fear to die ,</l>
     <l n="486">Yet scorn the purposes for which they live .</l>
     <l n="487">Then wherefore not renounce them ? No — the dread ,</l>
     <l n="488">The slavish dread of solitude , that breeds</l>
     <l n="489">Reflection and remorse , the fear of shame ,</l>
     <l n="490">And their inveterate habits , all forbid .</l>
     <l n="491">Whom call we gay ? That honour has been long</l>
     <l n="492">The boast of mere pretenders to the name .</l>
     <l n="493">The innocent are gay — the lark is gay ,</l>
     <l n="494">That dries his feathers , saturate with dew ,</l>
     <l n="495">Beneath the rosy cloud , while yet the beams</l>
     <l n="496">Of dayspring overshoot his humble nest .</l>
     <l n="497">The peasant too , a witness of his song ,</l>
     <l n="498">Himself a songster , is as gay as he .</l>
     <l n="499">But save me from the gaiety of those</l>
     <l n="500">Whose headaches nail them to a noon-day bed ;</l>
     <l n="501">And save me too from theirs whose haggard eyes</l>
     <l n="502">Flash desperation , and betray their pangs</l>
     <l n="503">For property stripp 'd off by cruel chance ;</l>
     <l n="504">From gaiety , that fills the bones with pain ,</l>
     <l n="505">The mouth with blasphemy , the heart with woe .</l>
     <l n="506">The earth was made so various , that the mind</l>
     <l n="507">Of desultory man , studious of change ,</l>
     <l n="508">And pleased with novelty , might be indulged .</l>
     <l n="509">Prospects , however lovely , may be seen</l>
     <l n="510">Till half their beauties fade ; the weary sight ,</l>
     <l n="511">Too well acquainted with their smiles , slides off</l>
     <l n="512">Fastidious , seeking less familiar scenes .</l>
     <l n="513">Then snug enclosures in the shelter 'd vale ,</l>
     <l n="514">Where frequent hedges intercept the eye ,</l>
     <l n="515">Delight us ; happy to renounce awhile ,</l>
     <l n="516">Not senseless of its charms , what still we love ,</l>
     <l n="517">That such short absence may endear it more .</l>
     <l n="518">Then forests , or the savage rock , may please ,</l>
     <l n="519">That hides the sea-mew in his hollow clefts</l>
     <l n="520">Above the reach of man . His hoary head ,</l>
     <l n="521">Conspicuous many a league , the mariner ,</l>
     <l n="522">Bound homeward , and in hope already there ,</l>
     <l n="523">Greets with three cheers exulting . At his waist</l>
     <l n="524">A girdle of half-wither 'd shrubs he shows ,</l>
     <l n="525">And at his feet the baffled billows die .</l>
     <l n="526">The common , overgrown with fern , and rough</l>
     <l n="527">With prickly gorse , that , shapeless and deform 'd ,</l>
     <l n="528">And dangerous to the touch , has yet its bloom ,</l>
     <l n="529">And decks itself with ornaments of gold ,</l>
     <l n="530">Yields no unpleasing ramble ; there the turf</l>
     <l n="531">Smells fresh , and , rich in odoriferous herbs</l>
     <l n="532">And fungous fruits of earth , regales the sense</l>
     <l n="533">With luxury of unexpected sweets .</l>
     <l n="534">There often wanders one , whom better days</l>
     <l n="535">Saw better clad , in cloak of satin trimm 'd</l>
     <l n="536">With lace , and hat with splendid riband bound .</l>
     <l n="537">A serving maid was she , and fell in love</l>
     <l n="538">With one who left her , went to sea , and died .</l>
     <l n="539">Her fancy follow 'd him through foaming waves</l>
     <l n="540">To distant shores ; and she would sit and weep</l>
     <l n="541">At what a sailor suffers ; fancy too ,</l>
     <l n="542">Delusive most where warmest wishes are ,</l>
     <l n="543">Would oft anticipate his glad return ,</l>
     <l n="544">And dream of transports she was not to know .</l>
     <l n="545">She heard the doleful tidings of his death —</l>
     <l n="546">And never smiled again ! and now she roams</l>
     <l n="547">The dreary waste ; there spends the livelong day ,</l>
     <l n="548">And there , unless when charity forbids ,</l>
     <l n="549">The livelong night . A tatter 'd apron hides ,</l>
     <l n="550">Worn as a cloak , and hardly hides , a gown</l>
     <l n="551">More tatter 'd still ; and both but ill conceal</l>
     <l n="552">A bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs .</l>
     <l n="553">She begs an idle pin of all she meets ,</l>
     <l n="554">And hoards them in her sleeve ; but needful food ,</l>
     <l n="555">Though press 'd with hunger oft , or comelier clothes ,</l>
     <l n="556">Though pinch 'd with cold , asks never .— Kate is crazed !</l>
     <l n="557">I see a column of slow-rising smoke</l>
     <l n="558">O'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild .</l>
     <l n="559">A vagabond and useless tribe there eat</l>
     <l n="560">Their miserable meal . A kettle , slung</l>
     <l n="561">Between two poles upon a stick transverse ,</l>
     <l n="562">Receives the morsel — flesh obscene of dog ,</l>
     <l n="563">Or vermin , or at best of cock purloin 'd</l>
     <l n="564">From his accustom 'd perch . Hard-faring race !</l>
     <l n="565">They pick their fuel out of every hedge ,</l>
     <l n="566">Which , kindled with dry leaves , just saves unquench 'd</l>
     <l n="567">The spark of life . The sportive wind blows wide</l>
     <l n="568">Their fluttering rags , and shows a tawny skin ,</l>
     <l n="569">The vellum of the pedigree they claim .</l>
     <l n="570">Great skill have they in palmistry , and more</l>
     <l n="571">To conjure clean away the gold they touch ,</l>
     <l n="572">Conveying worthless dross into its place ;</l>
     <l n="573">Loud when they beg , dumb only when they steal .</l>
     <l n="574">Strange ! that a creature rational , and cast</l>
     <l n="575">In human mould , should brutalize by choice</l>
     <l n="576">His nature ; and , though capable of arts ,</l>
     <l n="577">By which the world might profit , and himself ,</l>
     <l n="578">Self-banish 'd from society , prefer</l>
     <l n="579">Such squalid sloth to honourable toil !</l>
     <l n="580">Yet even these , though , feigning sickness oft ,</l>
     <l n="581">They swathe the forehead , drag the limping limb ,</l>
     <l n="582">And vex their flesh with artificial sores ,</l>
     <l n="583">Can change their whine into a mirthful note</l>
     <l n="584">When safe occasion offers ; and with dance ,</l>
     <l n="585">And music of the bladder and the bag ,</l>
     <l n="586">Beguile their woes , and make the woods resound .</l>
     <l n="587">Such health and gaiety of heart enjoy</l>
     <l n="588">The houseless rovers of the sylvan world ;</l>
     <l n="589">And , breathing wholesome air , and wandering much ,</l>
     <l n="590">Need other physic none to heal the effects</l>
     <l n="591">Of loathsome diet , penury , and cold .</l>
     <l n="592">Blest he , though undistinguish 'd from the crowd</l>
     <l n="593">By wealth or dignity , who dwells secure ,</l>
     <l n="594">Where man , by nature fierce , has laid aside</l>
     <l n="595">His fierceness , having learnt , though slow to learn ,</l>
     <l n="596">The manners and the arts of civil life .</l>
     <l n="597">His wants indeed are many ; but supply</l>
     <l n="598">Is obvious , placed within the easy reach</l>
     <l n="599">Of temperate wishes and industrious hands .</l>
     <l n="600">Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil ;</l>
     <l n="601">Not rude and surly , and beset with thorns ,</l>
     <l n="602">And terrible to sight , as when she springs</l>
     <l n="603">( If e'er she spring spontaneous ) in remote</l>
     <l n="604">And barbarous climes , where violence prevails ,</l>
     <l n="605">And strength is lord of all ; but gentle , kind ,</l>
     <l n="606">By culture tamed , by liberty refresh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="607">And all her fruits by radiant truth matured .</l>
     <l n="608">War and the chase engross the savage whole ,</l>
     <l n="609">War follow 'd for revenge , or to supplant</l>
     <l n="610">The envied tenants of some happier spot :</l>
     <l n="611">The chase for sustenance , precarious trust !</l>
     <l n="612">His hard condition with severe constraint</l>
     <l n="613">Binds all his faculties , forbids all growth</l>
     <l n="614">Of wisdom , proves a school , in which he learns</l>
     <l n="615">Sly circumvention , unrelenting hate ,</l>
     <l n="616">Mean self-attachment , and scarce aught beside .</l>
     <l n="617">Thus fare the shivering natives of the north ,</l>
     <l n="618">And thus the rangers of the western world ,</l>
     <l n="619">Where it advances far into the deep ,</l>
     <l n="620">Towards the antarctic . E'en the favour 'd isles ,</l>
     <l n="621">So lately found , although the constant sun</l>
     <l n="622">Cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile ,</l>
     <l n="623">Can boast but little virtue ; and , inert</l>
     <l n="624">Through plenty , lose in morals what they gain</l>
     <l n="625">In manners — victims of luxurious ease .</l>
     <l n="626">These therefore I can pity , placed remote</l>
     <l n="627">From all that science traces , art invents ,</l>
     <l n="628">Or inspiration teaches ; and enclosed</l>
     <l n="629">In boundless oceans , never to be pass 'd</l>
     <l n="630">By navigators uninform 'd as they ,</l>
     <l n="631">Or plough 'd perhaps by British bark again :</l>
     <l n="632">But , far beyond the rest , and with most cause ,</l>
     <l n="633">Thee , gentle savage !<span type="note_anchor">[ 807 ]</span>whom no love of thee</l>
     <l n="634">Or thine , but curiosity , perhaps ,</l>
     <l n="635">Or else vain-glory , prompted us to draw</l>
     <l n="636">Forth from thy native bowers , to show thee here</l>
     <l n="637">With what superior skill we can abuse</l>
     <l n="638">The gifts of Providence , and squander life .</l>
     <l n="639">The dream is past ; and thou hast found again</l>
     <l n="640">Thy cocoas and bananas , palms and yams ,</l>
     <l n="641">And homestall thatch 'd with leaves . But hast thou found</l>
     <l n="642">Their former charms ? And , having seen our state ,</l>
     <l n="643">Our palaces , our ladies , and our pomp</l>
     <l n="644">Of equipage , our gardens and our sports ,</l>
     <l n="645">And heard our music ; are thy simple friends ,</l>
     <l n="646">Thy simple fare , and all thy plain delights</l>
     <l n="647">As dear to thee as once ? And have thy joys</l>
     <l n="648">Lost nothing by comparison with ours ?</l>
     <l n="649">Rude as thou art ( for we return 'd thee rude</l>
     <l n="650">And ignorant , except of outward show ) ,</l>
     <l n="651">I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart</l>
     <l n="652">And spiritless as never to regret</l>
     <l n="653">Sweets tasted here , and left as soon as known .</l>
     <l n="654">Methinks I see thee straying on the beach ,</l>
     <l n="655">And asking of the surge that bathes thy foot ,</l>
     <l n="656">If ever it has wash 'd our distant shore .</l>
     <l n="657">I see thee weep , and thine are honest tears ,</l>
     <l n="658">A patriot 's for his country : thou art sad</l>
     <l n="659">At thought of her forlorn and abject state ,</l>
     <l n="660">From which no power of thine can raise her up .</l>
     <l n="661">Thus fancy paints thee , and though apt to err ,</l>
     <l n="662">Perhaps errs little when she paints thee thus .</l>
     <l n="663">She tells me , too , that duly every morn</l>
     <l n="664">Thou climb'st the mountain top , with eager eye</l>
     <l n="665">Exploring far and wide the watery waste</l>
     <l n="666">For sight of ship from England . Every speck</l>
     <l n="667">Seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale</l>
     <l n="668">With conflict of contending hopes and fears .</l>
     <l n="669">But comes at last the dull and dusky eve ,</l>
     <l n="670">And sends thee to thy cabin , well prepared</l>
     <l n="671">To dream all night of what the day denied .</l>
     <l n="672">Alas ! expect it not . We found no bait</l>
     <l n="673">To tempt us in thy country . Doing good ,</l>
     <l n="674">Disinterested good , is not our trade .</l>
     <l n="675">We travel far , ‘ tis true , but not for nought ;</l>
     <l n="676">And must be bribed to compass earth again</l>
     <l n="677">By other hopes and richer fruits than yours .</l>
     <l n="678">But though true worth and virtue in the mild</l>
     <l n="679">And genial soil of cultivated life</l>
     <l n="680">Thrive most , and may perhaps thrive only there ,</l>
     <l n="681">Yet not in cities oft : in proud , and gay ,</l>
     <l n="682">And gain-devoted cities . Thither flow ,</l>
     <l n="683">As to a common and most noisome sewer ,</l>
     <l n="684">The dregs and feculence of every land .</l>
     <l n="685">In cities foul example on most minds</l>
     <l n="686">Begets its likeness . Rank abundance breeds ,</l>
     <l n="687">In gross and pamper 'd cities , sloth , and lust ,</l>
     <l n="688">And wantonness , and gluttonous excess .</l>
     <l n="689">In cities vice is hidden with most ease ,</l>
     <l n="690">Or seen with least reproach ; and virtue , taught</l>
     <l n="691">By frequent lapse , can hope no triumph there</l>
     <l n="692">Beyond the achievement of successful flight .</l>
     <l n="693">I do confess them nurseries of the arts ,</l>
     <l n="694">In which they flourish most ; where , in the beams</l>
     <l n="695">Of warm encouragement , and in the eye</l>
     <l n="696">Of public note , they reach their perfect size .</l>
     <l n="697">Such London is , by taste and wealth proclaim 'd</l>
     <l n="698">The fairest capital of all the world :</l>
     <l n="699">By riot and incontinence the worst .</l>
     <l n="700">There touch 'd by Reynolds , a dull blank becomes</l>
     <l n="701">A lucid mirror , in which Nature sees</l>
     <l n="702">All her reflected features . Bacon there</l>
     <l n="703">Gives more than female beauty to a stone ,</l>

     <l n="705">Nor does the chisel occupy alone</l>
     <l n="706">The powers of sculpture , but the style as much ;</l>
     <l n="707">Each province of her art her equal care .</l>
     <l n="708">With nice incision of her guided steel</l>
     <l n="709">She ploughs a brazen field , and clothes a soil</l>
     <l n="710">So sterile with what charms soe'er she will ,</l>
     <l n="711">The richest scenery and the loveliest forms .</l>
     <l n="712">Where finds Philosophy her eagle eye ,</l>

     <l n="715">In London : where her implements exact ,</l>
     <l n="716">With which she calculates , computes , and scans</l>
     <l n="717">All distance , motion , magnitude , and now</l>
     <l n="718">Measures an atom , and now girds a world ?</l>
     <l n="719">In London . Where has commerce such a mart ,</l>
     <l n="720">So rich , so throng 'd , so drain 'd , and so supplied ,</l>
     <l n="721">As London — opulent , enlarged , and still</l>
     <l n="722">Increasing London ? Babylon of old</l>
     <l n="723">Not more the glory of the earth than she ,</l>

     <l n="725">She has her praise . Now mark a spot or two ,</l>
     <l n="726">That so much beauty would do well to purge ;</l>
     <l n="727">And show this queen of cities , that so fair</l>
     <l n="728">May yet be foul ; so witty , yet not wise .</l>
     <l n="729">It is not seemly , nor of good report ,</l>
     <l n="730">That she is slack in discipline ; more prompt</l>
     <l n="731">To avenge than to prevent the breach of law :</l>
     <l n="732">That she is rigid in denouncing death</l>
     <l n="733">On petty robbers , and indulges life</l>
     <l n="734">And liberty , and ofttimes honour too ,</l>
     <l n="735">To peculators of the public gold :</l>
     <l n="736">That thieves at home must hang ; but he , that puts</l>
     <l n="737">Into his over-gorged and bloated purse</l>
     <l n="738">The wealth of Indian provinces , escapes .</l>
     <l n="739">Nor is it well , nor can it come to good ,</l>
     <l n="740">That , through profane and infidel contempt</l>
     <l n="741">Of holy writ , she has presumed to annul</l>
     <l n="742">And abrogate , as roundly as she may ,</l>
     <l n="743">The total ordinance and will of God ;</l>
     <l n="744">Advancing Fashion to the post of Truth ,</l>
     <l n="745">And centring all authority in modes</l>
     <l n="746">And customs of her own , till sabbath rites</l>
     <l n="747">Have dwindled into unrespected forms ,</l>
     <l n="748">And knees and hassocks are well-nigh divorced .</l>
     <l n="749">God made the country , and man made the town ,</l>
     <l n="750">What wonder then that health and virtue , gifts</l>
     <l n="751">That can alone make sweet the bitter draught</l>
     <l n="752">That life holds out to all , should most abound</l>
     <l n="753">And least be threaten 'd in the fields and groves ?</l>
     <l n="754">Possess ye , therefore , ye who , borne about</l>
     <l n="755">In chariots and sedans , know no fatigue</l>
     <l n="756">But that of idleness , and taste no scenes</l>
     <l n="757">But such as art contrives , possess ye still</l>
     <l n="758">Your element ; there only can ye shine ;</l>
     <l n="759">There only minds like yours can do no harm .</l>
     <l n="760">Our groves were planted to console at noon</l>
     <l n="761">The pensive wanderer in their shades . At eve</l>
     <l n="762">The moonbeam , sliding softly in between</l>
     <l n="763">The sleeping leaves , is all the light they wish ,</l>
     <l n="764">Birds warbling all the music . We can spare</l>
     <l n="765">The splendour of your lamps ; they but eclipse</l>
     <l n="766">Our softer satellite . Your songs confound</l>
     <l n="767">Our more harmonious notes ; the thrush departs</l>
     <l n="768">Scared , and the offended nightingale is mute .</l>
     <l n="769">There is a public mischief in your mirth ;</l>
     <l n="770">It plagues your country . Folly such as yours ,</l>
     <l n="771">Graced with a sword , and worthier of a fan ,</l>
     <l n="772">Has made , what enemies could ne'er have done ,</l>
     <l n="773">Our arch of empire , stedfast but for you ,</l>
     <l n="774">A mutilated structure , soon to fall .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Reflections suggested by the conclusion of the former book — Peace among the nations recommended on the ground of their common fellowship in sorrow — Prodigies enumerated — Sicilian earthquakes — Man rendered obnoxious to these calamities by sin — God the agent in them — The philosophy that stops at secondary causes reproved — Our own late miscarriages accounted for — Satirical notice taken of our trips to Fontainbleau — But the pulpit , not satire , the proper engine of reformation — The reverend advertiser of engraved sermons — Petit-maître parson — The good preacher — Picture of a theatrical clerical coxcomb — Story-tellers and jesters in the pulpit reproved — Apostrophe to popular applause — Retailers of ancient philosophy expostulated with — Sum of the whole matter — Effects of sacerdotal mismanagement on the laity — Their folly and extravagance — The mischiefs of profusion — Profusion itself , with all its consequent evils , ascribed , as to its principal cause , to the want of discipline in the universities .</head>

     <l n="1">Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness ,</l>
     <l n="2">Some boundless contiguity of shade ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where rumour of oppression and deceit ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of unsuccessful or successful war ,</l>
     <l n="5">Might never reach me more ! My ear is pain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="6">My soul is sick , with every day 's report</l>
     <l n="7">Of wrong and outrage with which earth is fill 'd .</l>
     <l n="8">There is no flesh in man 's obdurate heart ,</l>
     <l n="9">It does not feel for man ; the natural bond</l>
     <l n="10">Of brotherhood is sever 'd as the flax</l>
     <l n="11">That falls asunder at the touch of fire .</l>
     <l n="12">He finds his fellow guilty of a skin</l>
     <l n="13">Not colour 'd like his own ; and , having power</l>
     <l n="14">To enforce the wrong , for such a worthy cause</l>
     <l n="15">Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey .</l>
     <l n="16">Lands intersected by a narrow frith</l>
     <l n="17">Abhor each other . Mountains interposed</l>
     <l n="18">Make enemies of nations , who had else</l>
     <l n="19">Like kindred drops been mingled into one .</l>
     <l n="20">Thus man devotes his brother , and destroys ;</l>
     <l n="21">And , worse than all , and most to be deplored ,</l>
     <l n="22">As human nature 's broadest , foulest blot ,</l>
     <l n="23">Chains him , and tasks him , and exacts his sweat</l>
     <l n="24">With stripes , that Mercy , with a bleeding heart ,</l>
     <l n="25">Weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast .</l>
     <l n="26">Then what is man ? And what man , seeing this ,</l>
     <l n="27">And having human feelings , does not blush ,</l>
     <l n="28">And hang his head , to think himself a man ?</l>
     <l n="29">I would not have a slave to till my ground ,</l>
     <l n="30">To carry me , to fan me while I sleep ,</l>
     <l n="31">And tremble when I wake , for all the wealth</l>
     <l n="32">That sinews bought and sold have ever earn 'd .</l>
     <l n="33">No : dear as freedom is , and in my heart 's</l>
     <l n="34">Just estimation prized above all price ,</l>
     <l n="35">I had much rather be myself the slave ,</l>
     <l n="36">And wear the bonds , than fasten them on him .</l>
     <l n="37">We have no slaves at home :— then why abroad ?</l>
     <l n="38">And they themselves , once ferried o'er the wave</l>
     <l n="39">That parts us , are emancipate and loosed .</l>
     <l n="40">Slaves cannot breathe in England ; if their lungs</l>
     <l n="41">Receive our air , that moment they are free ;</l>
     <l n="42">They touch our country , and their shackles fall .</l>
     <l n="43">That 's noble , and bespeaks a nation proud</l>
     <l n="44">And jealous of the blessing . Spread it then ,</l>
     <l n="45">And let it circulate through every vein</l>

     <l n="49">Benevolence , and peace , and mutual aid ,</l>
     <l n="50">Between the nations in a world that seems</l>
     <l n="51">To toll the death-bell of its own decease ,</l>
     <l n="52">And by the voice of all its elements</l>
     <l n="53">To preach the general doom .<span type="note_anchor">[ 808 ]</span>When were the winds</l>

     <l n="56">Their ancient barriers , deluging the dry ?</l>
     <l n="57">Fires from beneath , and meteors<span type="note_anchor">[ 809 ]</span>from above ,</l>
     <l n="58">Portentous , unexampled , unexplain 'd ,</l>

     <l n="61">More frequent , and foregone her usual rest .</l>
     <l n="62">Is it a time to wrangle , when the props</l>
     <l n="63">And pillars of our planet seem to fail ,</l>
     <l n="64">And Nature<span type="note_anchor">[ 810 ]</span>with a dim and sickly eye</l>

     <l n="66">More distant , and that prophecy demands</l>
     <l n="67">A longer respite , unaccomplished yet ;</l>
     <l n="68">Still they are frowning signals , and bespeak</l>
     <l n="69">Displeasure in his breast who smites the earth</l>
     <l n="70">Or heals it , makes it languish or rejoice .</l>
     <l n="71">And ‘ tis but seemly , that , where all deserve</l>
     <l n="72">And stand exposed by common peccancy</l>
     <l n="73">To what no few have felt , there should be peace ,</l>
     <l n="74">And brethren in calamity should love .</l>
     <l n="75">Alas for Sicily ! rude fragments now</l>
     <l n="76">Lie scatter 'd where the shapely column stood .</l>
     <l n="77">Her palaces are dust . In all her streets</l>
     <l n="78">The voice of singing and the sprightly chord</l>
     <l n="79">Are silent . Revelry , and dance , and show</l>
     <l n="80">Suffer a syncope and solemn pause ;</l>
     <l n="81">While God performs upon the trembling stage</l>
     <l n="82">Of his own works the dreadful part alone .</l>
     <l n="83">How does the earth receive him ?— with what signs</l>
     <l n="84">Of gratulation and delight her King ?</l>
     <l n="85">Pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad ,</l>
     <l n="86">Her sweetest flowers , her aromatic gums ,</l>
     <l n="87">Disclosing Paradise where'er he treads ?</l>
     <l n="88">She quakes at his approach . Her hollow womb</l>
     <l n="89">Conceiving thunders , through a thousand deeps</l>
     <l n="90">And fiery caverns , roars beneath his foot .</l>
     <l n="91">The hills move lightly , and the mountains smoke ,</l>
     <l n="92">For he has touch 'd them . From the extremest point</l>
     <l n="93">Of elevation down into the abyss</l>
     <l n="94">His wrath is busy , and his frown is felt .</l>
     <l n="95">The rocks fall headlong , and the valleys rise ,</l>
     <l n="96">The rivers die into offensive pools ,</l>
     <l n="97">And , charged with putrid verdure , breathe a gross</l>
     <l n="98">And mortal nuisance into all the air ,</l>
     <l n="99">What solid was , by transformation strange ,</l>
     <l n="100">Grows fluid ; and the fix 'd and rooted earth ,</l>
     <l n="101">Tormented into billows , heaves and swells ,</l>
     <l n="102">Or with a vortiginous and hideous whirl</l>
     <l n="103">Sucks down its prey insatiable . Immense</l>
     <l n="104">The tumult and the overthrow , the pangs</l>
     <l n="105">And agonies of human and of brute</l>
     <l n="106">Multitudes , fugitive on every side ,</l>
     <l n="107">And fugitive in vain . The sylvan scene</l>
     <l n="108">Migrates uplifted ; and with all its soil</l>
     <l n="109">Alighting in far distant fields , finds out</l>
     <l n="110">A new possessor , and survives the change .</l>
     <l n="111">Ocean has caught the frenzy , and , upwrought</l>
     <l n="112">To an enormous and o'erbearing height ,</l>
     <l n="113">Not by a mighty wind , but by that Voice</l>
     <l n="114">Which winds and waves obey , invades the shore</l>
     <l n="115">Resistless . Never such a sudden flood ,</l>
     <l n="116">Upridged so high , and sent on such a charge ,</l>
     <l n="117">Possess 'd an inland scene . Where now the throng</l>
     <l n="118">That press 'd the beach , and , hasty to depart ,</l>
     <l n="119">Look 'd to the sea for safety ? They are gone ,</l>
     <l n="120">Gone with the refluent wave into the deep —</l>
     <l n="121">A prince with half his people ! Ancient towers ,</l>
     <l n="122">And roofs embattled high , the gloomy scenes</l>
     <l n="123">Where beauty oft and letter 'd worth consume</l>
     <l n="124">Life in the unproductive shades of death ,</l>
     <l n="125">Fall prone : the pale inhabitants come forth ,</l>
     <l n="126">And , happy in their unforeseen release</l>
     <l n="127">From all the rigours of restraint , enjoy</l>
     <l n="128">The terrors of the day that sets them free .</l>
     <l n="129">Who then , that has thee , would not hold thee fast ,</l>
     <l n="130">Freedom ! whom they that lose thee so regret ,</l>
     <l n="131">That e'en a judgment , making way for thee ,</l>
     <l n="132">Seems in their eyes a mercy for thy sake .</l>
     <l n="133">Such evil sin hath wrought ; and such a flame</l>
     <l n="134">Kindled in heaven , that it burns down to earth ,</l>
     <l n="135">And , in the furious inquest that it makes</l>
     <l n="136">On God 's behalf , lays waste his fairest works .</l>
     <l n="137">The very elements , though each be meant</l>
     <l n="138">The minister of man , to serve his wants ,</l>
     <l n="139">Conspire against him . With his breath he draws</l>
     <l n="140">A plague into his blood ; and cannot use</l>
     <l n="141">Life 's necessary means , but he must die .</l>
     <l n="142">Storms rise to o'erwhelm him : or if stormy winds</l>
     <l n="143">Rise not , the waters of the deep shall rise ,</l>
     <l n="144">And , needing none assistance of the storm ,</l>
     <l n="145">Shall roll themselves ashore , and reach him there .</l>
     <l n="146">The earth shall shake him out of all his holds ,</l>
     <l n="147">Or make his house his grave : nor so content ,</l>
     <l n="148">Shall counterfeit the motions of the flood ,</l>
     <l n="149">And drown him in her dry and dusty gulfs .</l>
     <l n="150">What then !— were they the wicked above all ,</l>
     <l n="151">And we the righteous , whose fast-anchor 'd isle</l>
     <l n="152">Moved not , while theirs was rock 'd , like a light skiff ,</l>

     <l n="156">Of wrath obnoxious , God may choose his mark :</l>
     <l n="157">May punish , if he please , the less , to warn</l>
     <l n="158">The more malignant . If he spared not them ,</l>
     <l n="159">Tremble and be amazed at thine escape ,</l>
     <l n="160">Far guiltier England , lest he spare not thee !</l>
     <l n="161">Happy the man who sees a God employ 'd</l>
     <l n="162">In all the good and ill that chequer life !</l>

     <l n="166">Did not his eye rule all things , and intend</l>
     <l n="167">The least of our concerns ( since from the least</l>
     <l n="168">The greatest oft originate ;) could chance</l>
     <l n="169">Find place in his dominion , or dispose</l>
     <l n="170">One lawless particle to thwart his plan ;</l>
     <l n="171">Then God might be surprised , and unforeseen</l>
     <l n="172">Contingence might alarm him , and disturb</l>
     <l n="173">The smooth and equal course of his affairs .</l>
     <l n="174">This truth Philosophy , though eagle-eyed</l>
     <l n="175">In nature 's tendencies , oft overlooks ;</l>
     <l n="176">And , having found his instrument , forgets ,</l>
     <l n="177">Or disregards , or , more presumptuous still ,</l>
     <l n="178">Denies the power that wields it . God proclaims</l>
     <l n="179">His hot displeasure against foolish men ,</l>
     <l n="180">That live an atheist life : involves the heaven</l>
     <l n="181">In tempests ; quits his grasp upon the winds ,</l>
     <l n="182">And gives them all their fury ; bids a plague</l>
     <l n="183">Kindle a fiery boil upon the skin ,</l>
     <l n="184">And putrefy the breath of blooming Health .</l>
     <l n="185">He calls for Famine , and the meagre fiend</l>
     <l n="186">Blows mildew from between his shrivell 'd lips ,</l>
     <l n="187">And taints the golden ear . He springs his mines ,</l>
     <l n="188">And desolates a nation at a blast .</l>
     <l n="189">Forth steps the spruce philosopher , and tells</l>
     <l n="190">Of homogeneal and discordant springs</l>
     <l n="191">And principles ; of causes , how they work</l>
     <l n="192">By necessary laws their sure effects ;</l>
     <l n="193">Of action and re-action . He has found</l>
     <l n="194">The source of the disease that nature feels ,</l>
     <l n="195">And bids the world take heart and banish fear .</l>
     <l n="196">Thou fool ! will thy discovery of the cause</l>
     <l n="197">Suspend the effect , or heal it ? Has not God</l>
     <l n="198">Still wrought by means since first he made the world ?</l>
     <l n="199">And did he not of old employ his means</l>
     <l n="200">To drown it ? What is his creation less</l>
     <l n="201">Than a capacious reservoir of means</l>
     <l n="202">Form 'd for his use , and ready at his will ?</l>
     <l n="203">Go , dress thine eyes with eye-salve ; ask of him ,</l>
     <l n="204">Or ask of whomsoever he has taught ;</l>
     <l n="205">And learn , though late , the genuine cause of all .</l>
     <l n="206">England , with all thy faults , I love thee still —</l>

     <l n="211">With dripping rains , or wither 'd by a frost ,</l>
     <l n="212">I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies ,</l>
     <l n="213">And fields without a flower , for warmer France</l>
     <l n="214">With all her vines ; nor for Ausonia 's groves</l>
     <l n="215">Of golden fruitage , and her myrtle bowers .</l>
     <l n="216">To shake thy senate , and from heights sublime</l>
     <l n="217">Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire</l>
     <l n="218">Upon thy foes , was never meant my task :</l>
     <l n="219">But I can feel thy fortunes , and partake</l>
     <l n="220">Thy joys and sorrows , with as true a heart</l>
     <l n="221">As any thunderer there . And I can feel</l>

     <l n="226">Should England prosper , when such things , as smooth</l>
     <l n="227">And tender as a girl , all essenced o'er</l>
     <l n="228">With odours , and as profligate as sweet ;</l>
     <l n="229">Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath ,</l>
     <l n="230">And love when they should fight ; when such as these</l>
     <l n="231">Presume to lay their hand upon the ark</l>
     <l n="232">Of her magnificent and awful cause ?</l>
     <l n="233">Time was when it was praise and boast enough</l>
     <l n="234">In every clime , and travel where we might ,</l>
     <l n="235">That we were born her children . Praise enough</l>
     <l n="236">To fill the ambition of a private man ,</l>
     <l n="237">That Chatham 's language was his mother tongue ,</l>
     <l n="238">And Wolfe 's great name compatriot with his own .</l>
     <l n="239">Farewell those honours , and farewell with them</l>
     <l n="240">The hope of such hereafter ! They have fallen</l>
     <l n="241">Each in his field of glory ; one in arms ,</l>
     <l n="242">And one in council — Wolfe upon the lap</l>
     <l n="243">Of smiling Victory that moment won ,</l>
     <l n="244">And Chatham heart-sick of his country 's shame !</l>
     <l n="245">They made us many soldiers . Chatham , still</l>
     <l n="246">Consulting England 's happiness at home ,</l>
     <l n="247">Secured it by an unforgiving frown ,</l>
     <l n="248">If any wrong 'd her . Wolfe , where'er he fought ,</l>
     <l n="249">Put so much of his heart into his act ,</l>
     <l n="250">That his example had a magnet 's force ,</l>
     <l n="251">And all were swift to follow whom all loved .</l>
     <l n="252">Those suns are set . Oh rise some other such !</l>
     <l n="253">Or all that we have left is empty talk</l>
     <l n="254">Of old achievements and despair of new .</l>
     <l n="255">Now hoist the sail , and let the streamers float</l>
     <l n="256">Upon the wanton breezes . Strew the deck</l>
     <l n="257">With lavender , and sprinkle liquid sweets ,</l>
     <l n="258">That no rude savour maritime invade</l>
     <l n="259">The nose of nice nobility ! Breathe soft ,</l>
     <l n="260">Ye clarionets ; and softer still , ye flutes ;</l>
     <l n="261">That winds and waters , lull 'd by magic sounds ,</l>
     <l n="262">May bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore !</l>
     <l n="263">True , we have lost an empire — let it pass .</l>
     <l n="264">True ; we may thank the perfidy of France ,</l>
     <l n="265">That pick 'd the jewel out of England 's crown ,</l>
     <l n="266">With all the cunning of an envious shrew .</l>
     <l n="267">And let that pass — ‘ twas but a trick of state !</l>
     <l n="268">A brave man knows no malice , but at once</l>
     <l n="269">Forgets in peace the injuries of war ,</l>
     <l n="270">And gives his direst foe a friend 's embrace .</l>
     <l n="271">And , shamed as we have been , to the very beard</l>
     <l n="272">Braved and defied , and in our own sea proved</l>
     <l n="273">Too weak for those decisive blows that once</l>
     <l n="274">Ensured us mastery there , we yet retain</l>
     <l n="275">Some small pre-eminence ; we justly boast</l>
     <l n="276">At least superior jockeyship , and claim</l>
     <l n="277">The honours of the turf as all our own !</l>
     <l n="278">Go then , well worthy of the praise ye seek ,</l>
     <l n="279">And show the shame ye might conceal at home</l>
     <l n="280">In foreign eyes !— be grooms and win the plate ,</l>
     <l n="281">Where once your nobler fathers won a crown !—</l>
     <l n="282">‘ Tis generous to communicate your skill</l>
     <l n="283">To those that need it ! Folly is soon learn 'd :</l>
     <l n="284">And under such preceptors who can fail !</l>
     <l n="285">There is a pleasure in poetic pains</l>
     <l n="286">Which only poets know . The shifts and turns ,</l>
     <l n="287">The expedients and inventions multiform ,</l>
     <l n="288">To which the mind resorts , in chase of terms</l>
     <l n="289">Though apt , yet coy , and difficult to win —</l>
     <l n="290">To arrest the fleeting images that fill</l>
     <l n="291">The mirror of the mind , and hold them fast ,</l>
     <l n="292">And force them sit till he has pencil 'd off</l>
     <l n="293">A faithful likeness of the forms he views :</l>
     <l n="294">Then to dispose his copies with such art ,</l>
     <l n="295">That each may find its most propitious light ,</l>
     <l n="296">And shine by situation , hardly less</l>
     <l n="297">Than by the labour and the skill it cost ;</l>
     <l n="298">Are occupations of the poet 's mind</l>
     <l n="299">So pleasing , and that steal away the thought</l>
     <l n="300">With such address from themes of sad import ,</l>
     <l n="301">That , lost in his own musings , happy man !</l>
     <l n="302">He feels the anxieties of life , denied</l>
     <l n="303">Their wonted entertainment , all retire .</l>
     <l n="304">Such joys has he that sings . But ah ! not such ,</l>
     <l n="305">Or seldom such , the hearers of his song .</l>
     <l n="306">Fastidious , or else listless , or perhaps</l>
     <l n="307">Aware of nothing arduous in a task</l>
     <l n="308">They never undertook , they little note</l>
     <l n="309">His dangers or escapes , and haply find</l>
     <l n="310">Their least amusement where he found the most .</l>
     <l n="311">But is amusement all ? Studious of song ,</l>
     <l n="312">And yet ambitious not to sing in vain ,</l>
     <l n="313">I would not trifle merely , though the world</l>
     <l n="314">Be loudest in their praise who do no more .</l>
     <l n="315">Yet what can satire , whether grave or gay ?</l>
     <l n="316">It may correct a foible , may chastise</l>
     <l n="317">The freaks of fashion , regulate the dress ,</l>
     <l n="318">Retrench a sword-blade , or displace a patch ;</l>
     <l n="319">But where are its sublimer trophies found ?</l>
     <l n="320">What vice has it subdued ? whose heart reclaim 'd</l>
     <l n="321">By rigour ? or whom laugh 'd into reform ?</l>
     <l n="322">Alas ! Leviathan is not so tamed :</l>
     <l n="323">Laugh 'd at , he laughs again ; and , stricken hard ,</l>
     <l n="324">Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales ,</l>
     <l n="325">That fear no discipline of human hands .</l>
     <l n="326">The pulpit , therefore ( and I name it fill 'd</l>
     <l n="327">With solemn awe , that bids me well beware</l>
     <l n="328">With what intent I touch that holy thing ) —</l>
     <l n="329">The pulpit ( when the satirist has at last ,</l>
     <l n="330">Strutting and vapouring in an empty school ,</l>
     <l n="331">Spent all his force , and made no proselyte ) —</l>
     <l n="332">I say the pulpit ( in the sober use</l>
     <l n="333">Of its legitimate , peculiar powers )</l>
     <l n="334">Must stand acknowledged , while the world shall stand ,</l>
     <l n="335">The most important and effectual guard ,</l>
     <l n="336">Support , and ornament of Virtue 's cause .</l>
     <l n="337">There stands the messenger of truth : there stands</l>
     <l n="338">The legate of the skies !— His theme divine ,</l>
     <l n="339">His office sacred , his credentials clear .</l>
     <l n="340">By him the violated law speaks out</l>
     <l n="341">Its thunders ; and by him , in strains as sweet</l>
     <l n="342">As angels use , the Gospel whispers peace .</l>
     <l n="343">He ‘ stablishes the strong , restores the weak ,</l>
     <l n="344">Reclaims the wanderer , binds the broken heart ,</l>
     <l n="345">And , arm 'd himself in panoply complete</l>
     <l n="346">Of heavenly temper , furnishes with arms</l>
     <l n="347">Bright as his own , and trains , by every rule</l>
     <l n="348">Of holy discipline , to glorious war ,</l>
     <l n="349">The sacramental host of God 's elect !</l>
     <l n="350">Are all such teachers ?— would to heaven all were !</l>
     <l n="351">But hark — the doctor 's voice !— fast wedged between</l>
     <l n="352">Two empirics he stands , and with swoll'n cheeks</l>
     <l n="353">Inspires the news , his trumpet . Keener far</l>
     <l n="354">Than all invective is his bold harangue ,</l>
     <l n="355">While through that public organ of report</l>
     <l n="356">He hails the clergy ; and , defying shame ,</l>
     <l n="357">Announces to the world his own and theirs !</l>
     <l n="358">He teaches those to read , whom schools dismiss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="359">And colleges , untaught ; sells accent , tone ,</l>
     <l n="360">And emphasis in score , and gives to prayer</l>
     <l n="361">The adagio and andante it demands .</l>
     <l n="362">He grinds divinity of other days</l>
     <l n="363">Down into modern use ; transforms old print</l>
     <l n="364">To zigzag manuscript , and cheats the eyes</l>
     <l n="365">Of gallery critics by a thousand arts .</l>
     <l n="366">Are there who purchase of the doctor 's ware ?</l>
     <l n="367">Oh , name it not in Gath !— it cannot be ,</l>
     <l n="368">That grave and learned clerks should need such aid .</l>
     <l n="369">He doubtless is in sport , and does but droll ,</l>
     <l n="370">Assuming thus a rank unknown before —</l>
     <l n="371">Grand caterer and drynurse of the church !</l>
     <l n="372">I venerate the man whose heart is warm ,</l>
     <l n="373">Whose hands are pure , whose doctrine and whose life ,</l>
     <l n="374">Coincident , exhibit lucid proof</l>
     <l n="375">That he is honest in the sacred cause ,</l>
     <l n="376">To such I render more than mere respect ,</l>
     <l n="377">Whose actions say that they respect themselves ,</l>
     <l n="378">But loose in morals , and in manners vain ,</l>
     <l n="379">In conversation frivolous , in dress</l>
     <l n="380">Extreme , at once rapacious and profuse ;</l>
     <l n="381">Frequent in park with lady at his side ,</l>
     <l n="382">Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes ;</l>
     <l n="383">But rare at home , and never at his books ,</l>
     <l n="384">Or with his pen , save when he scrawls a card ;</l>
     <l n="385">Constant at routs , familiar with a round</l>
     <l n="386">Of ladyships — a stranger to the poor ;</l>
     <l n="387">Ambitious of preferment for its gold ,</l>
     <l n="388">And well prepared , by ignorance and sloth ,</l>
     <l n="389">By infidelity and love of world ,</l>
     <l n="390">To make God 's work a sinecure ; a slave</l>
     <l n="391">To his own pleasures and his patron 's pride :</l>
     <l n="392">From such apostles , O ye mitred heads ,</l>
     <l n="393">Preserve the church ! and lay not careless hands</l>
     <l n="394">On skulls that cannot teach , and will not learn .</l>
     <l n="395">Would I describe a preacher , such as Paul ,</l>
     <l n="396">Were he on earth , would hear , approve , and own —</l>
     <l n="397">Paul should himself direct me . I would trace</l>
     <l n="398">His master strokes , and draw from his design .</l>
     <l n="399">I would express him simple , grave , sincere ;</l>
     <l n="400">In doctrine uncorrupt ; in language plain ,</l>
     <l n="401">And plain in manner ; decent , solemn , chaste ,</l>
     <l n="402">And natural in gesture ; much impress 'd</l>
     <l n="403">Himself , as conscious of his awful charge ,</l>
     <l n="404">And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds</l>
     <l n="405">May feel it too ; affectionate in look ,</l>
     <l n="406">And tender in address , as well becomes</l>
     <l n="407">A messenger of grace to guilty men .</l>
     <l n="408">Behold the picture ! Is it like ?— Like whom ?</l>
     <l n="409">The things that mount the rostrum with a skip ,</l>
     <l n="410">And then skip down again ; pronounce a text ;</l>
     <l n="411">Cry — hem ; and reading what they never wrote ,</l>
     <l n="412">Just fifteen minutes , huddle up their work ,</l>
     <l n="413">And with a well-bred whisper close the scene !</l>
     <l n="414">In man or woman , but far most in man ,</l>
     <l n="415">And most of all in man that ministers</l>
     <l n="416">And serves the altar , in my soul I loathe</l>
     <l n="417">All affectation . ‘ Tis my perfect scorn ;</l>
     <l n="418">Object of my implacable disgust .</l>
     <l n="419">What ! will a man play tricks ? will he indulge</l>
     <l n="420">A silly fond conceit of his fair form ,</l>
     <l n="421">And just proportion , fashionable mien ,</l>
     <l n="422">And pretty face , in presence of his God ?</l>
     <l n="423">Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes ,</l>
     <l n="424">As with the diamond on his lily hand ,</l>
     <l n="425">And play his brilliant parts before my eyes ,</l>
     <l n="426">When I am hungry for the bread of life ?</l>
     <l n="427">He mocks his Maker , prostitutes and shames</l>
     <l n="428">His noble office , and , instead of truth ,</l>
     <l n="429">Displaying his own beauty , starves his flock !</l>
     <l n="430">Therefore , avaunt all attitude , and stare ,</l>
     <l n="431">And start theatric , practised at the glass !</l>
     <l n="432">I seek divine simplicity in him</l>
     <l n="433">Who handles things divine ; and all besides ,</l>
     <l n="434">Though learn 'd with labour , and though much admired</l>
     <l n="435">By curious eyes and judgments ill inform 'd ,</l>
     <l n="436">To me is odious as the nasal twang</l>
     <l n="437">Heard at conventicle , where worthy men ,</l>
     <l n="438">Misled by custom , strain celestial themes</l>
     <l n="439">Through the press 'd nostril , spectacle-bestrid .</l>
     <l n="440">Some , decent in demeanour while they preach ,</l>
     <l n="441">That task perform 'd , relapse into themselves ;</l>
     <l n="442">And , having spoken wisely , at the close</l>
     <l n="443">Grow wanton , and give proof to every eye ,</l>
     <l n="444">Whoe'er was edified , themselves were not !</l>
     <l n="445">Forth comes the pocket mirror .— First we stroke</l>
     <l n="446">An eyebrow ; next compose a straggling lock ;</l>
     <l n="447">Then with an air most gracefully perform 'd</l>
     <l n="448">Fall back into our seat , extend an arm ,</l>
     <l n="449">And lay it at its ease with gentle care ,</l>
     <l n="450">With handkerchief in hand depending low :</l>
     <l n="451">The better hand more busy gives the nose</l>
     <l n="452">Its bergamot , or aids the indebted eye</l>
     <l n="453">With opera glass , to watch the moving scene ,</l>
     <l n="454">And recognise the slow-retiring fair .—</l>
     <l n="455">Now this is fulsome ; and offends me more</l>
     <l n="456">Than in a churchman slovenly neglect</l>
     <l n="457">And rustic coarseness would . A heavenly mind</l>
     <l n="458">May be indifferent to her house of clay ,</l>
     <l n="459">And slight the hovel as beneath her care ;</l>
     <l n="460">But how a body so fantastic , trim ,</l>
     <l n="461">And quaint , in its deportment and attire ,</l>
     <l n="462">Can lodge a heavenly mind — demands a doubt .</l>
     <l n="463">He that negotiates between God and man ,</l>
     <l n="464">As God 's ambassador , the grand concerns</l>
     <l n="465">Of judgment and of mercy , should beware</l>
     <l n="466">Of lightness in his speech . ‘ Tis pitiful</l>
     <l n="467">To court a grin , when you should woo a soul ;</l>
     <l n="468">To break a jest , when pity would inspire</l>
     <l n="469">Pathetic exhortation ; and to address</l>
     <l n="470">The skittish fancy with facetious tales ,</l>
     <l n="471">When sent with God 's commission to the heart !</l>
     <l n="472">So did not Paul . Direct me to a quip</l>
     <l n="473">Or merry turn in all he ever wrote ,</l>
     <l n="474">And I consent you take it for your text ,</l>
     <l n="475">Your only one , till sides and benches fail .</l>
     <l n="476">No : he was serious in a serious cause ,</l>
     <l n="477">And understood too well the weighty terms</l>
     <l n="478">That he had taken in charge . He would not stoop</l>
     <l n="479">To conquer those by jocular exploits</l>
     <l n="480">Whom truth and soberness assail 'd in vain .</l>
     <l n="481">O popular applause ! what heart of man</l>
     <l n="482">Is proof against thy sweet seducing charms ?</l>
     <l n="483">The wisest and the best feel urgent need</l>
     <l n="484">Of all their caution in thy gentlest gales ;</l>
     <l n="485">But , swell 'd into a gust — who then , alas !</l>
     <l n="486">With all his canvas set , and inexpert ,</l>
     <l n="487">And therefore heedless , can withstand thy power ?</l>
     <l n="488">Praise , from the rivell 'd lips of toothless , bald</l>
     <l n="489">Decrepitude , and in the looks of lean</l>
     <l n="490">And craving Poverty , and in the bow</l>
     <l n="491">Respectful of the smutch 'd artificer ,</l>
     <l n="492">Is oft too welcome , and may much disturb</l>
     <l n="493">The bias of the purpose . How much more ,</l>
     <l n="494">Pour 'd forth by beauty splendid and polite ,</l>
     <l n="495">In language soft as Adoration breathes ?</l>
     <l n="496">Ah , spare your idol ! think him human still .</l>
     <l n="497">Charms he may have , but he has frailties too !</l>
     <l n="498">Dote not too much , nor spoil what ye admire .</l>
     <l n="499">All truth is from the sempiternal source</l>
     <l n="500">Of light divine . But Egypt , Greece , and Rome</l>
     <l n="501">Drew from the stream below . More favour 'd , we</l>
     <l n="502">Drink , when we choose it , at the fountain-head .</l>
     <l n="503">To them it flow 'd much mingled and defiled</l>
     <l n="504">With hurtful error , prejudice , and dreams</l>
     <l n="505">Illusive of philosophy , so call 'd ,</l>
     <l n="506">But falsely . Sages after sages strove</l>
     <l n="507">In vain to filter off a crystal draught</l>
     <l n="508">Pure from the lees , which often more enhanced</l>
     <l n="509">The thirst than slaked it , and not seldom bred</l>
     <l n="510">Intoxication and delirium wild .</l>
     <l n="511">In vain they push 'd inquiry to the birth</l>
     <l n="512">And spring-time of the world ; ask 'd , Whence is man ?</l>
     <l n="513">Why form 'd at all ? and wherefore as he is ?</l>
     <l n="514">Where must he find his Maker ? with what rites</l>
     <l n="515">Adore him ? Will he hear , accept , and bless ?</l>
     <l n="516">Or does he sit regardless of his works ?</l>
     <l n="517">Has man within him an immortal seed ?</l>
     <l n="518">Or does the tomb take all ? If he survive</l>
     <l n="519">His ashes , where ? and in what weal or woe ?</l>
     <l n="520">Knots worthy of solution , which alone</l>
     <l n="521">A Deity could solve . Their answers , vague</l>
     <l n="522">And all at random , fabulous and dark ,</l>
     <l n="523">Left them as dark themselves . Their rules of life ,</l>
     <l n="524">Defective and unsanction 'd , proved too weak</l>
     <l n="525">To bind the roving appetite , and lead</l>
     <l n="526">Blind nature to a God not yet reveal 'd .</l>
     <l n="527">‘ Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts ,</l>
     <l n="528">Explains all mysteries , except her own ,</l>
     <l n="529">And so illuminates the path of life</l>
     <l n="530">That fools discover it , and stray no more .</l>
     <l n="531">Now tell me , dignified and sapient sir ,</l>
     <l n="532">My man of morals , nurtured in the shades</l>
     <l n="533">Of Academus — is this false or true ?</l>
     <l n="534">Is Christ the abler teacher , or the schools ?</l>
     <l n="535">If Christ , then why resort at every turn</l>
     <l n="536">To Athens or to Rome , for wisdom short</l>
     <l n="537">Of man 's occasions , when in him reside</l>
     <l n="538">Grace , knowledge , comfort — an unfathom 'd store ?</l>
     <l n="539">How oft , when Paul has served us with a text ,</l>
     <l n="540">Has Epictetus , Plato , Tully preach 'd !</l>
     <l n="541">Men that , if now alive , would sit content</l>
     <l n="542">And humble learners of a Saviour 's worth ,</l>
     <l n="543">Preach it who might . Such was their love of truth ,</l>
     <l n="544">Their thirst of knowledge , and their candour too !</l>
     <l n="545">And thus it is .— The pastor , either vain</l>
     <l n="546">By nature , or by flattery made so , taught</l>
     <l n="547">To gaze at his own splendour , and to exalt</l>
     <l n="548">Absurdly , not his office , but himself ;</l>
     <l n="549">Or unenlighten 'd , and too proud to learn ;</l>
     <l n="550">Or vicious , and not therefore apt to teach ;</l>
     <l n="551">Perverting often , by the stress of lewd</l>
     <l n="552">And loose example , whom he should instruct ;</l>
     <l n="553">Exposes , and holds up to broad disgrace</l>
     <l n="554">The noblest function , and discredits much</l>
     <l n="555">The brightest truths that man has ever seen .</l>
     <l n="556">For ghostly counsel — if it either fall</l>
     <l n="557">Below the exigence , or be not back 'd</l>
     <l n="558">With show of love , at least with hopeful proof</l>
     <l n="559">Of some sincerity on the giver 's part ;</l>
     <l n="560">Or be dishonour 'd in the exterior form</l>
     <l n="561">And mode of its conveyance by such tricks ,</l>
     <l n="562">As move derision , or by foppish airs</l>
     <l n="563">And histrionic mummery , that let down</l>
     <l n="564">The pulpit to the level of the stage —</l>
     <l n="565">Drops from the lips a disregarded thing .</l>
     <l n="566">The weak perhaps are moved , but are not taught ,</l>
     <l n="567">While prejudice in men of stronger minds</l>
     <l n="568">Takes deeper root , confirm 'd by what they see .</l>
     <l n="569">A relaxation of religion 's hold</l>
     <l n="570">Upon the roving and untutor 'd heart</l>
     <l n="571">Soon follows , and , the curb of conscience snapp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="572">The laity run wild .— But do they now ?</l>
     <l n="573">Note their extravagance , and be convinced .</l>
     <l n="574">As nations , ignorant of God , contrive</l>
     <l n="575">A wooden one , so we , no longer taught</l>
     <l n="576">By monitors that mother church supplies ,</l>
     <l n="577">Now make our own . Posterity will ask</l>
     <l n="578">( If e'er posterity see verse of mine )</l>
     <l n="579">Some fifty or a hundred lustrums hence ,</l>
     <l n="580">What was a monitor in George 's days ?</l>
     <l n="581">My very gentle reader , yet unborn ,</l>
     <l n="582">Of whom I needs must augur better things ,</l>
     <l n="583">Since Heaven would sure grow weary of a world</l>
     <l n="584">Productive only of a race like ours ,</l>
     <l n="585">A monitor is wood — plank shaven thin .</l>
     <l n="586">We wear it at our backs . There , closely braced</l>
     <l n="587">And neatly fitted , it compresses hard</l>
     <l n="588">The prominent and most unsightly bones ,</l>
     <l n="589">And binds the shoulders flat . We prove its use</l>
     <l n="590">Sovereign and most effectual to secure</l>
     <l n="591">A form , not now gymnastic as of yore ,</l>
     <l n="592">From rickets and distortion , else our lot .</l>
     <l n="593">But , thus admonish 'd , we can walk erect —</l>
     <l n="594">One proof at least of manhood ! while the friend</l>
     <l n="595">Sticks close , a Mentor worthy of his charge .</l>
     <l n="596">Our habits , costlier than Lucullus wore ,</l>
     <l n="597">And by caprice as multiplied as his ,</l>
     <l n="598">Just please us while the fashion is at full ,</l>
     <l n="599">But change with every moon . The sycophant</l>
     <l n="600">Who waits to dress us arbitrates their date ;</l>
     <l n="601">Surveys his fair reversion with keen eye ;</l>
     <l n="602">Finds one ill made , another obsolete ,</l>
     <l n="603">This fits not nicely , that is ill conceived ;</l>
     <l n="604">And , making prize of all that he condemns ,</l>
     <l n="605">With our expenditure defrays his own .</l>
     <l n="606">Variety 's the very spice of life ,</l>
     <l n="607">That gives it all its flavour . We have run</l>
     <l n="608">Through every change that Fancy , at the loom</l>
     <l n="609">Exhausted , has had genius to supply ;</l>
     <l n="610">And , studious of mutation still , discard</l>
     <l n="611">A real elegance , a little used ,</l>
     <l n="612">For monstrous novelty and strange disguise .</l>
     <l n="613">We sacrifice to dress , till household joys</l>
     <l n="614">And comforts cease . Dress drains our cellar dry</l>
     <l n="615">And keeps our larder lean ; puts out our fires ;</l>
     <l n="616">And introduces hunger , frost , and woe ,</l>
     <l n="617">Where peace and hospitality might reign .</l>
     <l n="618">What man that lives , and that knows how to live ,</l>
     <l n="619">Would fail to exhibit at the public shows</l>
     <l n="620">A form as splendid as the proudest there ,</l>
     <l n="621">Though appetite raise outcries at the cost ?</l>
     <l n="622">A man of the town dines late , but soon enough ,</l>
     <l n="623">With reasonable forecast and despatch ,</l>
     <l n="624">To ensure a side-box station at half-price .</l>
     <l n="625">You think , perhaps , so delicate his dress ,</l>
     <l n="626">His daily fare as delicate . Alas !</l>
     <l n="627">He picks clean teeth , and , busy as he seems</l>
     <l n="628">With an old tavern quill , is hungry yet !</l>
     <l n="629">The rout is Folly 's circle , which she draws</l>
     <l n="630">With magic wand . So potent is the spell ,</l>
     <l n="631">That none , decoy 'd into that fatal ring ,</l>
     <l n="632">Unless by Heaven 's peculiar grace , escape .</l>
     <l n="633">There we grow early grey , but never wise ;</l>
     <l n="634">There form connexions , but acquire no friend ;</l>
     <l n="635">Solicit pleasure , hopeless of success ;</l>
     <l n="636">Waste youth in occupations only fit</l>
     <l n="637">For second childhood , and devote old age</l>
     <l n="638">To sports which only childhood could excuse .</l>
     <l n="639">There they are happiest who dissemble best</l>
     <l n="640">Their weariness ; and they the most polite</l>
     <l n="641">Who squander time and treasure with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="642">Though at their own destruction . She that asks</l>
     <l n="643">Her dear five hundred friends contemns them all ,</l>
     <l n="644">And hates their coming . They ( what can they less ? )</l>
     <l n="645">Make just reprisals ; and , with cringe and shrug ,</l>
     <l n="646">And bow obsequious , hide their hate of her .</l>
     <l n="647">All catch the frenzy , downward from her grace ,</l>
     <l n="648">Whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies ,</l>
     <l n="649">And gild our chamber ceilings as they pass ,</l>
     <l n="650">To her , who , frugal only that her thrift</l>
     <l n="651">May feed excesses she can ill afford ,</l>
     <l n="652">Is hackney 'd home unlackey 'd ; who , in haste</l>
     <l n="653">Alighting , turns the key in her own door ,</l>
     <l n="654">And , at the watchman 's lantern borrowing light</l>
     <l n="655">Finds a cold bed her only comfort left .</l>
     <l n="656">Wives beggar husbands , husbands starve their wives ,</l>
     <l n="657">On Fortune 's velvet altar offering up</l>
     <l n="658">Their last poor pittance — Fortune , most severe</l>
     <l n="659">Of goddesses yet known , and costlier far</l>
     <l n="660">Than all that held their routs in Juno 's heaven .—</l>
     <l n="661">So fare we in this prison-house , the world ;</l>
     <l n="662">And ‘ tis a fearful spectacle to see</l>
     <l n="663">So many maniacs dancing in their chains .</l>
     <l n="664">They gaze upon the links that hold them fast</l>
     <l n="665">With eyes of anguish , execrate their lot ,</l>
     <l n="666">Then shake them in despair , and dance again !</l>
     <l n="667">Now basket up the family of plagues</l>
     <l n="668">That waste our vitals ; peculation , sale</l>
     <l n="669">Of honour , perjury , corruption , frauds</l>
     <l n="670">By forgery , by subterfuge of law ,</l>
     <l n="671">By tricks and lies as numerous and as keen</l>
     <l n="672">As the necessities their authors feel ;</l>
     <l n="673">Then cast them , closely bundled , every brat</l>
     <l n="674">At the right door . Profusion is the sire .</l>
     <l n="675">Profusion unrestrain 'd , with all that 's base</l>
     <l n="676">In character , has litter 'd all the land ,</l>
     <l n="677">And bred , within the memory of no few ,</l>
     <l n="678">A priesthood such as Baal 's was of old ,</l>
     <l n="679">A people such as never was till now .</l>
     <l n="680">It is a hungry vice :— it eats up all</l>
     <l n="681">That gives society its beauty , strength ,</l>
     <l n="682">Convenience , and security , and use :</l>
     <l n="683">Makes men mere vermin , worthy to be trapp 'd</l>
     <l n="684">And gibbeted , as fast as catchpole claws</l>
     <l n="685">Can seize the slippery prey : unties the knot</l>
     <l n="686">Of union , and converts the sacred band ,</l>
     <l n="687">That holds mankind together , to a scourge .</l>
     <l n="688">Profusion , deluging a state with lusts</l>
     <l n="689">Of grossest nature and of worst effects ,</l>
     <l n="690">Prepares it for its ruin : hardens , blinds ,</l>
     <l n="691">And warps the consciences of public men ,</l>
     <l n="692">Till they can laugh at Virtue ; mock the fools</l>
     <l n="693">That trust them ; and in the end disclose a face</l>
     <l n="694">That would have shock 'd Credulity herself ,</l>
     <l n="695">Unmask 'd , vouchsafing this their sole excuse —</l>
     <l n="696">Since all alike are selfish , why not they ?</l>
     <l n="697">This does Profusion , and the accursed cause</l>
     <l n="698">Of such deep mischief has itself a cause .</l>
     <l n="699">In colleges and halls , in ancient days ,</l>
     <l n="700">When learning , virtue , piety , and truth</l>
     <l n="701">Were precious and inculcated with care ,</l>
     <l n="702">There dwelt a sage call 'd Discipline . His head ,</l>
     <l n="703">Not yet by time completely silver 'd o'er ,</l>
     <l n="704">Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth ,</l>
     <l n="705">But strong for service still , and unimpair 'd .</l>
     <l n="706">His eye was meek and gentle , and a smile</l>
     <l n="707">Play 'd on his lips ; and in his speech was heard</l>
     <l n="708">Paternal sweetness , dignity , and love .</l>
     <l n="709">The occupation dearest to his heart</l>
     <l n="710">Was to encourage goodness . He would stroke</l>
     <l n="711">The head of modest and ingenuous worth ,</l>
     <l n="712">That blush 'd at its own praise ; and press the youth</l>
     <l n="713">Close to his side that pleased him . Learning grew</l>
     <l n="714">Beneath his care a thriving vigorous plant ;</l>
     <l n="715">The mind was well-inform 'd , the passions held</l>
     <l n="716">Subordinate , and diligence was choice .</l>
     <l n="717">If e'er it chanced , as sometimes chance it must ,</l>
     <l n="718">That one among so many overleap 'd</l>
     <l n="719">The limits of control , his gentle eye</l>
     <l n="720">Grew stern , and darted a severe rebuke :</l>
     <l n="721">His frown was full of terror , and his voice</l>
     <l n="722">Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe</l>
     <l n="723">As left him not , till penitence had won</l>
     <l n="724">Lost favour back again , and closed the breach .</l>
     <l n="725">But Discipline , a faithful servant long ,</l>
     <l n="726">Declined at length into the vale of years :</l>
     <l n="727">A palsy struck his arm ; his sparkling eye</l>
     <l n="728">Was quench 'd in rheums of age ; his voice , unstrung ,</l>
     <l n="729">Grew tremulous , and moved derision more</l>
     <l n="730">Than reverence in perverse rebellious youth .</l>
     <l n="731">So colleges and halls neglected much</l>
     <l n="732">Their good old friend ; and Discipline at length ,</l>
     <l n="733">O'erlook ' d and unemploy 'd , fell sick , and died .</l>
     <l n="734">Then Study languish 'd , Emulation slept ,</l>
     <l n="735">And Virtue fled . The schools became a scene</l>
     <l n="736">Of solemn farce , where ignorance in stilts ,</l>
     <l n="737">His cap well lined with logic not his own ,</l>
     <l n="738">With parrot tongue perform 'd the scholar 's part ,</l>
     <l n="739">Proceeding soon a graduated dunce .</l>
     <l n="740">Then Compromise had place , and Scrutiny</l>
     <l n="741">Became stone blind ; Precedence went in truck ,</l>
     <l n="742">And he was competent whose purse was so .</l>
     <l n="743">A dissolution of all bonds ensued ;</l>
     <l n="744">The curbs invented for the mulish mouth</l>
     <l n="745">Of headstrong youth were broken ; bars and bolts</l>
     <l n="746">Grew rusty by disuse ; and massy gates</l>
     <l n="747">Forgot their office , opening with a touch ;</l>
     <l n="748">Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade ,</l>
     <l n="749">The tassell 'd cap and the spruce band a jest ,</l>
     <l n="750">A mockery of the world ! What need of these</l>
     <l n="751">For gamesters , jockeys , brothellers impure ,</l>
     <l n="752">Spendthrifts , and booted sportsmen , oftener seen</l>
     <l n="753">With belted waist and pointers at their heels</l>
     <l n="754">Than in the bounds of duty ? What was learn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="755">If aught was learned in childhood , is forgot ;</l>
     <l n="756">And such expense as pinches parents blue ,</l>
     <l n="757">And mortifies the liberal hand of love ,</l>
     <l n="758">Is squander 'd in pursuit of idle sports</l>
     <l n="759">And vicious pleasures ; buys the boy a name</l>
     <l n="760">That sits a stigma on his father 's house ,</l>
     <l n="761">And cleaves through life inseparably close</l>
     <l n="762">To him that wears it . What can after-games</l>
     <l n="763">Of riper joys , and commerce with the world ,</l>
     <l n="764">The lewd vain world , that must receive him soon ,</l>
     <l n="765">Add to such erudition , thus acquired ,</l>
     <l n="766">Where science and where virtue are profess 'd ?</l>
     <l n="767">They may confirm his habits , rivet fast</l>
     <l n="768">His folly , but to spoil him is a task</l>
     <l n="769">That bids defiance to the united powers</l>
     <l n="770">Of fashion , dissipation , taverns , stews .</l>
     <l n="771">Now blame we most the nurslings or the nurse ?</l>
     <l n="772">The children , crook 'd , and twisted , and deform 'd ,</l>
     <l n="773">Through want of care ; or her , whose winking eye</l>
     <l n="774">And slumbering oscitancy mars the brood ?</l>
     <l n="775">The nurse , no doubt . Regardless of her charge ,</l>
     <l n="776">She needs herself correction ; needs to learn</l>
     <l n="777">That it is dangerous sporting with the world ,</l>
     <l n="778">With things so sacred as a nation 's trust ,</l>
     <l n="779">The nurture of her youth , her dearest pledge .</l>
     <l n="780">All are not such . I had a brother once —</l>
     <l n="781">Peace to the memory of a man of worth ,</l>
     <l n="782">A man of letters , and of manners too !</l>
     <l n="783">Of manners sweet as Virtue always wears ,</l>
     <l n="784">When gay good-nature dresses her in smiles .</l>
     <l n="785">He graced a college ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 811 ]</span>in which order yet</l>
     <l n="786">Was sacred ; and was honour 'd , loved , and wept</l>
     <l n="787">By more than one , themselves conspicuous there .</l>
     <l n="788">Some minds are temper 'd happily , and mix 'd</l>
     <l n="789">With such ingredients of good sense and taste</l>
     <l n="790">Of what is excellent in man , they thirst</l>
     <l n="791">With such a zeal to be what they approve ,</l>
     <l n="792">That no restraints can circumscribe them more</l>
     <l n="793">Than they themselves by choice , for wisdom 's sake .</l>
     <l n="794">Nor can example hurt them ; what they see</l>
     <l n="795">Of vice in others but enhancing more</l>
     <l n="796">The charms of virtue in their just esteem .</l>
     <l n="797">If such escape contagion , and emerge</l>
     <l n="798">Pure from so foul a pool to shine abroad ,</l>
     <l n="799">And give the world their talents and themselves ,</l>
     <l n="800">Small thanks to those , whose negligence or sloth</l>
     <l n="801">Exposed their inexperience to the snare ,</l>
     <l n="802">And left them to an undirected choice .</l>
     <l n="803">See then the quiver broken and decay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="804">In which are kept our arrows ! Rusting there</l>
     <l n="805">In wild disorder , and unfit for use ,</l>
     <l n="806">What wonder , if , discharged into the world ,</l>
     <l n="807">They shame their shooters with a random flight ,</l>
     <l n="808">Their points obtuse , and feathers drunk with wine !</l>
     <l n="809">Well may the church wage unsuccessful war ,</l>
     <l n="810">With such artillery arm 'd . Vice parries wide</l>
     <l n="811">The undreaded volley with a sword of straw ,</l>
     <l n="812">And stands an impudent and fearless mark .</l>
     <l n="813">Have we not track 'd the felon home , and found</l>
     <l n="814">His birthplace and his dam ? The country mourns ,</l>
     <l n="815">Mourns because every plague that can infest</l>
     <l n="816">Society , and that saps and worms the base</l>

   <p>As one who , long in thickets and in brakes Entangled , winds now this way and now that His devious course uncertain , seeking home ; Or , having long in miry ways been foil 'd , And sore discomfited , from slough to slough Plunging , and half despairing of escape ; If chance at length he finds a greensward smooth And faithful to the foot , his spirits rise , He chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed , And winds his way with pleasure and with ease ; So I , designing other themes , and call 'd To adorn the Sofa with eulogium due , To tell its slumbers , and to paint its dreams , Have rambled wide . In country , city , seat Of academic fame ( howe'er deserved ,) Long held , and scarcely disengaged at last . But now with pleasant pace a cleanlier road I mean to tread . I feel myself at large , Courageous , and refresh 'd for future toil , If toil awaits me , or if dangers new . Since pulpits fail , and sounding boards reflect Most part an empty ineffectual sound , What chance that I , to fame so little known , Nor conversant with men or manners much , Should speak to purpose , or with better hope Crack the satiric thong ? ‘ Twere wiser far For me , enamour 'd of sequester 'd scenes , And charm 'd with rural beauty , to repose , Where chance may throw me , beneath elm or vine , My languid limbs , when summer sears the plains ; Or , when rough winter rages , on the soft And shelter 'd Sofa , while the nitrous air Feeds a blue flame , and makes a cheerful hearth ; There , undisturb 'd by Folly , and apprised How great the danger of disturbing her , To muse in silence , or at least confine Remarks that gall so many to the few , My partners in retreat . Disgust conceal 'd Is ofttimes proof of wisdom , when the fault Is obstinate , and cure beyond our reach . Domestic Happiness , thou only bliss Of Paradise that has survived the fall ! Though few now taste thee unimpair 'd and pure , Or tasting long enjoy thee ! too infirm , Or too incautious , to preserve thy sweets Unmix 'd with drops of bitter , which neglect Or temper sheds into thy crystal cup ; Thou art the nurse of Virtue , in thine arms She smiles , appearing , as in truth she is , Heaven-born , and destined to the skies again . Thou art not known where Pleasure is adored , That reeling goddess with the zoneless waist And wandering eyes , still leaning on the arm Of Novelty , her fickle , frail support ; For thou art meek and constant , hating change , And finding in the calm of truth-tried love Joys that her stormy raptures never yield . Forsaking thee , what shipwreck have we made Of honour , dignity , and fair renown ! Till prostitution elbows us aside In all our crowded streets ; and senates seem Convened for purposes of empire less Than to release the adultress from her bond . The adultress ! what a theme for angry verse ! What provocation to the indignant heart , That feels for injur 'd love ! but I disdain The nauseous task , to paint her as she is , Cruel , abandon 'd , glorying in her shame ! No :— let her pass , and , charioted along In guilty splendour , shake the public ways ; The frequency of crimes has washed them white ; And verse of mine shall never brand the wretch , Whom matrons now , of character unsmirch 'd , And chaste themselves , are not ashamed to own . Virtue and vice had boundaries in old time , Not to be pass 'd : and she , that had renounced Her sex 's honour , was renounced herself By all that prized it ; not for prudery 's sake , But dignity 's , resentful of the wrong . ‘ Twas hard perhaps on here and there a waif , Desirous to return , and not received ; But was a wholesome rigour in the main , And taught the unblemish 'd to preserve with care That purity , whose loss was loss of all . Men too were nice in honour in those days , And judged offenders well . Then he that sharp 'd , And pocketed a prize by fraud obtain 'd , Was mark 'd and shunn 'd as odious . He that sold His country , or was slack when she required His every nerve in action and at stretch , Paid , with the blood that he had basely spared , The price of his default . But now — yes , now We are become so candid and so fair , So liberal in construction , and so rich In Christian charity , ( good-natured age ! ) That they are safe , sinners of either sex , Transgress what laws they may . Well dress 'd , well bred , Well equipaged , is ticket good enough To pass us readily through every door . Hypocrisy , detest her as we may , ( And no man 's hatred ever wrong 'd her yet ,) May claim this merit still — that she admits The worth of what she mimics with such care , And thus gives virtue indirect applause ; But she has burnt her mask , not needed here , Where Vice has such allowance , that her shifts And specious semblances have lost their use . I was a stricken deer , that left the herd Long since : with many an arrow deep infix 'd My panting side was charged , when I withdrew , To seek a tranquil death in distant shades . There was I found by One who had himself Been hurt by the archers . In his side he bore , And in his hands and feet , the cruel scars . With gentle force soliciting the darts , He drew them forth , and heal 'd , and bade me live . Since then , with few associates , in remote And silent woods I wander , far from those My former partners of the peopled scene ; With few associates , and not wishing more . Here much I ruminate , as much I may , With other views of men and manners now Than once , and others of a life to come . I see that all are wanderers , gone astray Each in his own delusions ; they are lost In chace of fancied happiness still woo 'd And never won . Dream after dream ensues ; And still they dream that they shall still succeed ; And still are disappointed . Rings the world With the vain stir . I sum up half mankind , And add two-thirds of the remaining half , And find the total of their hopes and fears Dreams , empty dreams . The million flit as gay As if created only like the fly , That spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon , To sport their season , and be seen no more . The rest are sober dreamers , grave and wise , And pregnant with discoveries new and rare . Some write a narrative of wars , and feats Of heroes little known ; and call the rant A history : describe the man , of whom His own coevals took but little note ; And paint his person , character , and views , As they had known him from his mother 's womb . They disentangle from the puzzled skein , In which obscurity has wrapp 'd them up , The threads of politic and shrewd design , That ran through all his purposes , and charge His mind with meanings that he never had , Or having , kept conceal 'd . Some drill and bore The solid earth , and from the strata there Extract a register , by which we learn , That he who made it , and reveal 'd its date To Moses , was mistaken in its age . Some , more acute , and more industrious still , Contrive creation ; travel nature up To the sharp peak of her sublimest height , And tell us whence the stars ; why some are fix 'd , And planetary some ; what gave them first Rotation , from what fountain flow 'd their light . Great contest follows , and much learned dust Involves the combatants ; each claiming truth , And truth disclaiming both . And thus they spend The little wick of life 's poor shallow lamp In playing tricks with nature , giving laws To distant worlds , and trifling in their own . Is't not a pity , now , that tickling rheums Should ever tease the lungs and blear the sight Of oracles like these ? Great pity too , That , having wielded the elements , and built A thousand systems , each in his own way , They should go out in fume , and be forgot ? Ah ! what is life thus spent ? and what are they But frantic who thus spend it ? all for smoke — Eternity for bubbles proves at last A senseless bargain . When I see such games Play 'd by the creatures of a Power who swears That he will judge the earth , and call the fool To a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain ; And when I weigh this seeming wisdom well , And prove it in the infallible result So hollow and so false — I feel my heart Dissolve in pity , and account the learn 'd , If this be learning , most of all deceived . Great crimes alarm the conscience , but it sleeps While thoughtful man is plausibly amused . Defend me therefore , common sense , say I , From reveries so airy , from the toil Of dropping buckets into empty wells , And growing old in drawing nothing up ! ‘ Twere well , says one sage erudite , profound , Terribly arch 'd and aquiline his nose , And overbuilt with most impending brows ,— ‘ Twere well , could you permit the world to live As the world pleases : what 's the world to you ? Much . I was born of woman , and drew milk As sweet as charity from human breasts . I think , articulate , I laugh and weep , And exercise all functions of a man . How then should I and any man that lives Be strangers to each other ? Pierce my vein , Take of the crimson stream meandering there , And catechise it well : apply thy glass , Search it , and prove now if it be not blood Congenial with thine own : and , if it be , What edge of subtlety canst thou suppose Keen enough , wise and skilful as thou art , To cut the link of brotherhood , by which One common Maker bound me to the kind ? True ; I am no proficient , I confess , In arts like yours . I cannot call the swift And perilous lightnings from the angry clouds , And bid them hide themselves in earth beneath ; I cannot analyse the air , nor catch The parallax of yonder luminous point , That seems half quench 'd in the immense abyss : Such powers I boast not — neither can I rest A silent witness of the headlong rage , Or heedless folly by which thousands die , Bone of my bone , and kindred souls to mine . God never meant that man should scale the heavens By strides of human wisdom . In his works , Though wondrous , he commands us in his word To seek him rather , where his mercy shines . The mind indeed , enlighten 'd from above , Views him in all ; ascribes to the grand cause The grand effect ; acknowledges with joy His manner , and with rapture tastes his style . But never yet did philosophic tube , That brings the planets home into the eye Of Observation , and discovers , else Not visible , his family of worlds , Discover him that rules them ; such a veil Hangs over mortal eyes , blind from the birth , And dark in things divine . Full often too Our wayward intellect , the more we learn Of nature , overlooks her Author more ; From instrumental causes proud to draw Conclusions retrograde and mad mistake . But if his word once teach us , shoot a ray Through all the heart 's dark chambers , and reveal Truths undiscern 'd but by that holy light , Then all is plain . Philosophy , baptized In the pure fountain of eternal love , Has eyes indeed ; and , viewing all she sees As meant to indicate a God to man , Gives him his praise , and forfeits not her own . Learning has borne such fruit in other days On all her branches : piety has found Friends in the friends of science , and true prayer Has flow 'd from lips wet with Castalian dews . Such was thy wisdom , Newton , child-like sage ! Sagacious reader of the works of God , And his word sagacious . Such , too , thine , Milton , whose genius had angelic wings , And fed on manna ! And such thine , in whom Our British Themis gloried with just cause , Immortal Hale ! for deep discernment praised , And sound integrity , not more than famed For sanctity of manners undefiled . All flesh is grass , and all its glory fades Like the fair flower dishevell 'd in the wind ; Riches have wings , and grandeur is a dream . The man we celebrate must find a tomb , And we that worship him ignoble graves . Nothing is proof against the general curse Of vanity , that seizes all below . The only amaranthine flower on earth Is virtue ; the only lasting treasure , truth . But what is truth ? ‘ Twas Pilate 's question put To Truth itself , that deign 'd him no reply . And wherefore ? will not God impart his light To them that ask it ?— Freely — ‘ tis his joy , His glory , and his nature to impart . But to the proud , uncandid , insincere , Or negligent inquirer , not a spark . What 's that which brings contempt upon a book , And him who writes it , though the style be neat , The method clear , and argument exact ? That makes a minister in holy things The joy of many and the dread of more , His name a theme for praise and for reproach ?— That , while it gives us worth in God 's account , Depreciates and undoes us in our own ? What pearl is it that rich men cannot buy , That learning is too proud to gather up ; But which the poor , and the despised of all , Seek and obtain , and often find unsought ? Tell me — and I will tell thee what is truth . O friendly to the best pursuits of man , Friendly to thought , to virtue , and to peace , Domestic life in rural pleasure pass 'd ! Few know thy value , and few taste thy sweets ; Though many boast thy favours , and affect To understand and choose thee for their own . But foolish man foregoes his proper bliss , E'en as his first progenitor , and quits , Though placed in Paradise ( for earth has still Some traces of her youthful beauty left ,) Substantial happiness for transient joy . Scenes form 'd for contemplation , and to nurse The growing seeds of wisdom ; that suggest , By every pleasing image they present , Reflections such as meliorate the heart , Compose the passions , and exalt the mind ; Scenes such as these ‘ tis his supreme delight To fill with riot , and defile with blood . Should some contagion , kind to the poor brutes We persecute , annihilate the tribes That draw the sportsman over hill and dale , Fearless and rapt away from all his cares ; Should never game-fowl hatch her eggs again , Nor baited hook deceive the fish 's eye ; Could pageantry and dance , and feast and song , Be quell 'd in all our summer months ’ retreat ; How many self-deluded nymphs and swains , Who dream they have a taste for fields and groves , Would find them hideous nurseries of the spleen , And crowd the roads , impatient for the town ! They love the country , and none else , who seek For their own sake its silence and its shade . Delights which who would leave , that has a heart Susceptible of pity , or a mind Cultured and capable of sober thought , For all the savage din of the swift pack , And clamours of the field ?— Detested sport , That owes its pleasures to another 's pain ; That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks Of harmless nature , dumb , but yet endued With eloquence , that agonies inspire Of silent tears and heart-distending sighs ? Vain tears , alas ! and sighs that never find A corresponding tone in jovial souls ! Well — one at least is safe . One shelter 'd hare Has never heard the sanguinary yell Of cruel man , exulting in her woes . Innocent partner of my peaceful home , Whom ten long years ’ experience of my care Has made at last familiar ; she has lost Much of her vigilant instinctive dread , Not needful here , beneath a roof like mine . Yes — thou mayest eat thy bread , and lick the hand That feeds thee ; thou mayest frolic on the floor At evening , and at night retire secure To thy straw couch , and slumber unalarm 'd ; For I have gained thy confidence , have pledged All that is human in me to protect Thine unsuspecting gratitude and love . If I survive thee , I will dig thy grave ; And , when I place thee in it , sighing say , “ I knew at least one hare that had a friend . ” How various his employments whom the world Calls idle ; and who justly in return Esteems that busy world an idler too ! Friends , books , a garden , and perhaps his pen , Delightful industry enjoy 'd at home , And Nature , in her cultivated trim Dress 'd to his taste , inviting him abroad — Can he want occupation who has these ? Will he be idle who has much to enjoy ? Me , therefore , studious of laborious ease , Not slothful , happy to deceive the time , Not waste it , and aware that human life Is but a loan to be repaid with use , When He shall call his debtors to account , From whom are all our blessings , business finds E'en here : while sedulous I seek to improve , At least neglect not , or leave unemploy 'd , The mind He gave me ; driving it , though slack Too oft , and much impeded in its work , By causes not to be divulged in vain , To its just point — the service of mankind . He , that attends to his interior self , That has a heart , and keeps it ; has a mind That hungers , and supplies it ; and who seeks A social , not a dissipated life , Has business ; feels himself engaged to achieve No unimportant , though a silent , task . A life all turbulence and noise may seem To him that leads it wise , and to be praised ; But wisdom is a pearl with most success Sought in still water and beneath clear skies . He that is ever occupied in storms , Or dives not for it , or brings up instead , Vainly industrious , a disgraceful prize . The morning finds the self-sequestered man Fresh for his task , intend what task he may . Whether inclement seasons recommend His warm but simple home , where he enjoys With her who shares his pleasures and his heart , Sweet converse , sipping calm the fragrant lymph Which neatly she prepares ; then to his book Well chosen , and not sullenly perused In selfish silence , but imparted oft , As aught occurs , that she may smile to hear , Or turn to nourishment , digested well . Or if the garden , with its many cares , All well repaid , demand him , he attends The welcome call , conscious how much the hand Of lubbard Labour needs his watchful eye , Oft loitering lazily , if not o'erseen , Or misapplying his unskilful strength . Nor does he govern only or direct , But much performs himself . No works , indeed , That ask robust , tough sinews , bred to toil , Servile employ ; but such as may amuse , Not tire , demanding rather skill than force . Proud of his well-spread walls , he views his trees , That meet , no barren interval between , With pleasure more than e'en their fruits afford ; Which , save himself who trains them , none can feel . These therefore are his own peculiar charge ; No meaner hand may discipline the shoots , None but his steel approach them . What is weak , Distemper 'd , or has lost prolific powers , Impair 'd by age , his unrelenting hand Dooms to the knife : nor does he spare the soft And succulent , that feeds its giant growth , But barren , at the expense of neighbouring twigs Less ostentatious , and yet studded thick With hopeful gems . The rest , no portion left That may disgrace his art , or disappoint Large expectation , he disposes neat At measured distances , that air and sun , Admitted freely , may afford their aid , And ventilate and warm the swelling buds . Hence Summer has her riches , Autumn hence , And hence e'en Winter fills his wither 'd hand With blushing fruits , and plenty not his own .<span type="note_anchor">[ 812 ]</span>Fair recompense of labour well bestow 'd , And wise precaution ; which a clime so rude Makes needful still , whose Spring is but the child Of churlish Winter , in her froward moods Discovering much the temper of her sire . For oft , as if in her the stream of mild Maternal nature had reversed its course , She brings her infants forth with many smiles ; But , once delivered , kills them with a frown . He therefore , timely warn 'd himself , supplies Her want of care , screening and keeping warm The plenteous bloom , that no rough blast may sweep His garlands from the boughs . Again , as oft As the sun peeps , and vernal airs breathe mild , The fence withdrawn , he gives them every beam , And spreads his hopes before the blaze of day . To raise the prickly and green-coated gourd , So grateful to the palate , and when rare So coveted , else base and disesteem 'd — Food for the vulgar merely — is an art That toiling ages have but just matured , And at this moment unassay 'd in song . Yet gnats have had , and frogs and mice , long since , Their eulogy ; those sang the Mantuan bard ; And these the Grecian , in ennobling strains ; And in thy numbers , Phillips , shines for aye , The solitary shilling . Pardon then , Ye sage dispensers of poetic fame , The ambition of one meaner far , whose powers , Presuming an attempt not less sublime , Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste Of critic appetite no sordid fare , A cucumber , while costly yet and scarce . The stable yields a stercoraceous heap , Impregnated with quick fermenting salts , And potent to resist the freezing blast : For , ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf Deciduous , when now November dark Checks vegetation in the torpid plant Exposed to his cold breath , the task begins . Warily therefore , and with prudent heed , He seeks a favour 'd spot ; that where he builds The agglomerated pile his frame may front The sun 's meridian disk , and at the back Enjoy close shelter , wall , or reeds , or hedge Impervious to the wind . First he bids spread Dry fern or litter 'd hay , that may imbibe The ascending damps ; then leisurely impose , And lightly , shaking it with agile hand From the full fork , the saturated straw . What longest binds the closest forms secure The shapely side , that as it rises takes , By just degrees , an overhanging breadth , Sheltering the base with its projected eaves ; The uplifted frame , compact at every joint , And overlaid with clear translucent glass , He settles next upon the sloping mount , Whose sharp declivity shoots off secure From the dash 'd pane the deluge as it falls . He shuts it close , and the first labour ends . Thrice must the voluble and restless earth Spin round upon her axle , ere the warmth , Slow gathering in the midst , through the square mass Diffused , attain the surface : when , behold ! A pestilent and most corrosive steam , Like a gross fog Boeotian , rising fast , And fast condensed upon the dewy sash , Asks egress ; which obtain 'd , the overcharged And drench 'd conservatory breathes abroad , In volumes wheeling slow , the vapour dank ; And , purified , rejoices to have lost Its foul inhabitant . But to assuage The impatient fervour , which it first conceives Within its reeking bosom , threatening death To his young hopes , requires discreet delay . Experience , slow preceptress , teaching oft The way to glory by miscarriage foul , Must prompt him , and admonish how to catch The auspicious moment , when the temper 'd heat , Friendly to vital motion , may afford Soft fomentation , and invite the seed . The seed , selected wisely , plump , and smooth , And glossy , he commits to pots of size Diminutive , well fill 'd with well prepared And fruitful soil , that has been treasured long , And drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds . These on the warm and genial earth , that hides The smoking manure , and o'erspreads it all , He places lightly , and , as time subdues The rage of fermentation , plunges deep In the soft medium , till they stand immersed . Then rise the tender germs , upstarting quick , And spreading wide their spongy lobes ; at first Pale , wan , and livid ; but assuming soon , If fann 'd by balmy and nutritious air , Strain 'd through the friendly mats , a vivid green . Two leaves produced , two rough indented leaves , Cautious he pinches from the second stalk A pimple , that portends a future sprout , And interdicts its growth . Thence straight succeed The branches , sturdy to his utmost wish ; Prolific all , and harbingers of more . The crowded roots demand enlargement now , And transplantation in an ampler space . Indulged in what they wish , they soon supply Large foliage , overshadowing golden flowers , Blown on the summit of the apparent fruit . These have their sexes ; and when summer shines , The bee transports the fertilizing meal From flower to flower , and e'en the breathing air Wafts the rich prize to its appointed use . Not so when winter scowls . Assistant Art Then acts in Nature 's office , brings to pass The glad espousals , and ensures the crop . Grudge not , ye rich , ( since Luxury must have His dainties , and the World 's more numerous half Lives by contriving delicates for you ,) Grudge not the cost . Ye little know the cares , The vigilance , the labour , and the skill , That day and night are exercised , and hang Upon the ticklish balance of suspense , That ye may garnish your profuse regales With summer fruits brought forth by wintry suns . Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart The process . Heat , and cold , and wind , and steam , Moisture , and drought , mice , worms , and swarming flies , Minute as dust , and numberless , oft work Dire disappointment , that admits no cure , And which no care can obviate . It were long , Too long , to tell the expedients and the shifts Which he that fights a season so severe Devises , while he guards his tender trust ; And oft at last in vain . The learn 'd and wise Sarcastic would exclaim , and judge the song Cold as its theme , and like its theme the fruit Of too much labour , worthless when produced . Who loves a garden loves a greenhouse too . Unconscious of a less propitious clime , There blooms exotic beauty , warm and snug , While the winds whistle , and the snows descend . The spiry myrtle with unwithering leaf Shines there , and flourishes . The golden boast Of Portugal and western India there , The ruddier orange , and the paler lime , Peep through their polish 'd foliage at the storm , And seem to smile at what they need not fear . The amomum there with intermingling flowers And cherries hangs her twigs . Geranium boasts Her crimson honours ; and the spangled beau , Ficoides , glitters bright the winter long . All plants , of every leaf that can endure The winter 's frown , if screen 'd from his shrewd bite , Live there , and prosper . Those Ausonia claims , Levantine regions these ; the Azores send Their jessamine , her jessamine remote Caffraria : foreigners from many lands , They form one social shade , as if convened By magic summons of the Orphean lyre . Yet just arrangement , rarely brought to pass But by a master 's hand , disposing well The gay diversities of leaf and flower , Must lend its aid to illustrate all their charms , And dress the regular yet various scene . Plant behind plant aspiring , in the van The dwarfish , in the rear retired , but still Sublime above the rest , the statelier stand . So once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome , A noble show ! while Roscius trod the stage ; And so , while Garrick , as renown 'd as he , The sons of Albion ; fearing each to lose Some note of Nature 's music from his lips , And covetous of Shakspeare 's beauty , seen In every flash of his far beaming eye . Nor taste alone and well contrived display Suffice to give the marshall 'd ranks the grace Of their complete effect . Much yet remains Unsung , and many cares are yet behind , And more laborious ; cares on which depends Their vigour , injured soon , not soon restored . The soil must be renew 'd , which often wash 'd Loses its treasure of salubrious salts , And disappoints the roots ; the slender roots Close interwoven , where they meet the vase , Must smooth be shorn away ; the sapless branch Must fly before the knife ; the wither 'd leaf Must be detach 'd , and where it strews the floor Swept with a woman 's neatness , breeding else Contagion , and disseminating death . Discharge but these kind offices ( and who Would spare , that loves them , offices like these ? ) Well they reward the toil . The sight is pleased , The scent regaled , each odoriferous leaf , Each opening blossom freely breathes abroad Its gratitude , and thanks him with its sweets . So manifold , all pleasing in their kind , All healthful , are the employs of rural life , Reiterated as the wheel of time Runs round ; still ending and beginning still . Nor are these all . To deck the shapely knoll , That softly swell 'd and gaily dress 'd appears A flowery island , from the dark green lawn Emerging , must be deem 'd a labour due To no mean hand , and asks the touch of taste . Here also grateful mixture of well match 'd And sorted hues , ( each giving each relief , And by contrasted beauty shining more ,) Is needful . Strength may wield the ponderous spade , May turn the clod , and wheel the compost home ; But elegance , chief grace the garden shows , And most attractive , is the fair result Of thought ; the creature of a polish 'd mind . Without it all is gothic as the scene To which the insipid citizen resorts Near yonder heath ; where Industry misspent , But proud of his uncouth ill chosen task , Has made a heaven on earth ; with suns and moons Of close ramm 'd stones has charged the encumber 'd soil , And fairly laid the zodiac in the dust . He therefore , who would see his flowers disposed Sightly and in just order , ere he gives The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds , Forecasts the future whole ; that when the scene Shall break into its preconceived display , Each for itself , and all as with one voice Conspiring , may attest his bright design . Nor even then , dismissing as perform 'd His pleasant work , may he suppose it done . Few self-supported flowers endure the wind Uninjured , but expect the upholding aid Of the smooth shaven prop , and , neatly tied , Are wedded thus , like beauty to old age , For interest sake , the living to the dead . Some clothe the soil that feeds them , far diffused And lowly creeping , modest and yet fair , Like virtue , thriving most where little seen ; Some , more aspiring , catch the neighbour shrub With clasping tendrils , and invest his branch , Else unadorn 'd , with many a gay festoon And fragrant chaplet , recompensing well The strength they borrow with the grace they lend . All hate the rank society of weeds , Noisome , and ever greedy to exhaust The impoverish 'd earth ; an overbearing race , That , like the multitude made faction-mad , Disturb good order , and degrade true worth . O blest seclusion from a jarring world , Which he , thus occupied , enjoys ! Retreat Cannot indeed to guilty man restore Lost innocence , or cancel follies past ; But it has peace , and much secures the mind From all assaults of evil ; proving still A faithful barrier , not o'erleap ' d with ease By vicious Custom , raging uncontroll 'd Abroad , and desolating public life . When fierce temptation , seconded within By traitor Appetite , and arm 'd with darts Temper 'd in Hell , invades the throbbing breast , To combat may be glorious , and success Perhaps may crown us ; but to fly is safe . Had I the choice of sublunary good , What could I wish , that I possess not here ? Health , leisure , means to improve it , friendship , peace , No loose or wanton , though a wandering , muse , And constant occupation without care . Thus blest I draw a picture of that bliss ; Hopeless indeed , that dissipated minds , And profligate abusers of a world Created fair so much in vain for them , Should seek the guiltless joys that I describe . Allured by my report : but sure no less That self-condemn 'd they must neglect the prize , And what they will not taste must yet approve . What we admire we praise ; and , when we praise , Advance it into notice , that , its worth Acknowledged , others may admire it too . I therefore recommend , though at the risk Of popular disgust , yet boldly still , The cause of piety and sacred truth , And virtue , and those scenes which God ordain 'd Should best secure them and promote them most , Scenes that I love , and with regret perceive Forsaken , or through folly not enjoy 'd . Pure is the nymph , though liberal of her smiles , And chaste , though unconfined , whom I extol . Not as the prince in Shushan , when he call 'd , Vain-glorious of her charms , his Vashti forth , To grace the full pavilion , His design Was but to boast his own peculiar good , Which all might view with envy , none partake . My charmer is not mine alone ; my sweets , And she that sweetens all my bitters too , Nature , enchanting Nature , in whose form And lineaments divine I trace a hand That errs not , and finds raptures still renew 'd , Is free to all men — universal prize . Strange that so fair a creature should yet want Admirers , and be destined to divide With meaner objects e'en the few she finds ! Stripp 'd of her ornaments , her leaves , and flowers , She loses all her influence . Cities then Attract us , and neglected Nature pines , Abandon 'd , as unworthy of our love . But are not wholesome airs , though unperfumed By roses ; and clear suns , though scarcely felt ; And groves , if unharmonious , yet secure From clamour , and whose very silence charms ; To be preferr 'd to smoke , to the eclipse That metropolitan volcanoes make , Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long ; And to the stir of Commerce , driving slow , And thundering loud , with his ten thousand wheels ? They would be , were not madness in the head , And folly in the heart ; were England now What England was , plain , hospitable , kind , And undebauch 'd . But we have bid farewell To all the virtues of those better days , And all their honest pleasures . Mansions once Knew their own masters ; and laborious hinds , Who had survived the father , serv 'd the son . Now the legitimate and rightful lord Is but a transient guest , newly arrived , And soon to be supplanted . He that saw His patrimonial timber cast its leaf Sells the last scantling , and transfers the price To some shrewd sharper , ere it buds again . Estates are landscapes , gazed upon awhile , Then advertised , and auctioneer 'd away . The country starves , and they that feed the o'ercharged And surfeited lewd town with her fair dues , By a just judgment strip and starve themselves . The wings , that waft our riches out of sight , Grow on the gamester 's elbows ; and the alert And nimble motion of those restless joints , That never tire , soon fans them all away . Improvement too , the idol of the age , Is fed with many a victim . Lo , he comes ! The omnipotent magician , Brown , appears ! Down falls the venerable pile , the abode Of our forefathers — a grave whisker 'd race , But tasteless . Springs a palace in its stead , But in a distant spot ; where more exposed It may enjoy the advantage of the north , And aguish east , till time shall have transform 'd Those naked acres to a sheltering grove . He speaks . The lake in front becomes a lawn ; Woods vanish , hills subside , and valleys rise ; And streams , as if created for his use , Pursue the track of his directing wand , Sinuous or straight , now rapid and now slow , Now murmuring soft , now roaring in cascades — E'en as he bids ! The enraptured owner smiles . ‘ Tis finish 'd , and yet , finish 'd as it seems , Still wants a grace , the loveliest it could show , A mine to satisfy the enormous cost . Drain 'd to the last poor item of his wealth , He sighs , departs , and leaves the accomplish 'd plan , That he has touch 'd , retouch 'd , many a long day Labour 'd , and many a night pursued in dreams , Just when it meets his hopes , and proves the heaven He wanted , for a wealthier to enjoy ! And now perhaps the glorious hour is come When , having no stake left , no pledge to endear Her interests , or that gives her sacred cause A moment 's operation on his love , He burns with most intense and flagrant zeal , To serve his country . Ministerial grace Deals him out money from the public chest ; Or , if that mine be shut , some private purse Supplies his need with a usurious loan , To be refunded duly , when his vote Well managed shall have earn 'd its worthy price . O innocent , compared with arts like these , Crape , and cock 'd pistol , and the whistling ball Sent through the traveller 's temples ? He that finds One drop of Heaven 's sweet mercy in his cup , Can dig , beg , rot , and perish , well content , So he may wrap himself in honest rags At his last gasp ; but could not for a world Fish up his dirty and dependent bread From pools and ditches of the commonwealth , Sordid and sickening at his own success . Ambition , avarice , penury incurr 'd By endless riot , vanity , the lust Of pleasure and variety , despatch , As duly as the swallows disappear , The world of wandering knights and squires to town . London engulfs them all ! The shark is there , And the shark 's prey ; the spendthrift , and the leech That sucks him ; there the sycophant , and he Who , with bareheaded and obsequious bows , Begs a warm office , doom 'd to a cold jail And groat per diem , if his patron frown . The levee swarms , as if in golden pomp Were character 'd on every statesman 's door , “ BATTER 'D AND BANKRUPT FORTUNES MENDED HERE . ” These are the charms that sully and eclipse The charms of nature . ‘ Tis the cruel gripe That lean hard-handed Poverty inflicts , The hope of better things , the chance to win , The wish to shine , the thirst to be amused , That at the sound of Winter 's hoary wing Unpeople all our counties of such herds Of fluttering , loitering , cringing , begging , loose , And wanton vagrants , as make London , vast And boundless as it is , a crowded coop . O thou , resort and mart of all the earth , Chequer 'd with all complexions of mankind , And spotted with all crimes ; in whom I see Much that I love , and more that I admire , And all that I abhor ; thou freckled fair , That pleasest and yet shock'st me , I can laugh , And I can weep , can hope , and can despond , Feel wrath and pity , when I think on thee ! Ten righteous would have saved a city once , And thou hast many righteous .— Well for thee — That salt preserves thee ; more corrupted else , And therefore more obnoxious , at this hour , Than Sodom in her day had power to be , For whom God heard his Abraham plead in vain .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Hark ! ‘ tis the twanging horn o'er yonder bridge ,</l>
     <l n="2">That with its wearisome but needful length</l>
     <l n="3">Bestrides the wintry flood , in which the moon</l>
     <l n="4">Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright ;—</l>
     <l n="5">He comes , the herald of a noisy world ,</l>
     <l n="6">With spatter 'd boots , strapp 'd waist , and frozen locks ;</l>
     <l n="7">News from all nations lumbering at his back .</l>
     <l n="8">True to his charge , the close-pack 'd load behind ,</l>
     <l n="9">Yet , careless what he brings , his one concern</l>
     <l n="10">Is to conduct it to the destined inn ;</l>
     <l n="11">And , having dropp 'd the expected bag , pass on .</l>
     <l n="12">He whistles as he goes , light-hearted wretch ,</l>
     <l n="13">Cold and yet cheerful : messenger of grief</l>
     <l n="14">Perhaps to thousands , and of joy to some ;</l>
     <l n="15">To him indifferent whether grief or joy .</l>
     <l n="16">Houses in ashes , and the fall of stocks ,</l>
     <l n="17">Births , deaths , and marriages , epistles wet</l>
     <l n="18">With tears , that trickled down the writer 's cheeks</l>
     <l n="19">Fast as the periods from his fluent quill ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains ,</l>
     <l n="21">Or nymphs responsive , equally affect</l>
     <l n="22">His horse and him , unconscious of them all .</l>
     <l n="23">But O the important budget ! usher 'd in</l>
     <l n="24">With such heart-shaking music , who can say</l>
     <l n="25">What are its tidings ? have our troops awaked ?</l>
     <l n="26">Or do they still , as if with opium drugg 'd</l>
     <l n="27">Snore to the murmurs of the Atlantic wave ?</l>
     <l n="28">Is India free ? and does she wear her plumed</l>
     <l n="29">And jewell 'd turban with a smile of peace ,</l>
     <l n="30">Or do we grind her still ? The grand debate ,</l>
     <l n="31">The popular harangue , the tart reply ,</l>
     <l n="32">The logic , and the wisdom , and the wit ,</l>
     <l n="33">And the loud laugh — I long to know them all ;</l>
     <l n="34">I burn to set the imprison 'd wranglers free ,</l>
     <l n="35">And give them voice and utterance once again .</l>
     <l n="36">Now stir the fire , and close the shutters fast ,</l>
     <l n="37">Let fall the curtains , wheel the sofa round ,</l>
     <l n="38">And , while the bubbling and loud hissing urn</l>
     <l n="39">Throws up a steamy column , and the cups ,</l>
     <l n="40">That cheer but not inebriate , wait on each ,</l>
     <l n="41">So let us welcome peaceful evening in .</l>
     <l n="42">Not such his evening , who with shining face</l>
     <l n="43">Sweats in the crowded theatre , and , squeezed</l>
     <l n="44">And bored with elbow points through both his sides ,</l>
     <l n="45">Outscolds the ranting actor on the stage :</l>
     <l n="46">Nor his , who patient stands till his feet throb ,</l>
     <l n="47">And his head thumps , to feed upon the breath</l>
     <l n="48">Of patriots , bursting with heroic rage ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or placemen , all tranquillity and smiles .</l>
     <l n="50">This folio of four pages , happy work !</l>
     <l n="51">Which not e'en critics criticise ; that holds</l>
     <l n="52">Inquisitive attention , while I read ,</l>
     <l n="53">Fast bound in chains of silence , which the fair ,</l>
     <l n="54">Though eloquent themselves , yet fear to break ;</l>
     <l n="55">What is it but a map of busy life ,</l>
     <l n="56">Its fluctuations , and its vast concerns ?</l>
     <l n="57">Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge</l>
     <l n="58">That tempts Ambition . On the summit see</l>
     <l n="59">The seals of office glitter in his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="60">He climbs , he pants , he grasps them ! At his heels ,</l>
     <l n="61">Close at his heels , a demagogue ascends ,</l>
     <l n="62">And with a dextrous jerk soon twists him down ,</l>
     <l n="63">And wins them , but to lose them in his turn .</l>
     <l n="64">Here rills of oily eloquence , in soft</l>
     <l n="65">Meanders , lubricate the course they take ;</l>
     <l n="66">The modest speaker is ashamed and grieved</l>
     <l n="67">To engross a moment 's notice ; and yet begs ,</l>
     <l n="68">Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts ,</l>
     <l n="69">However trivial all that he conceives .</l>
     <l n="70">Sweet bashfulness ! it claims at least this praise ;</l>
     <l n="71">The dearth of information and good sense ,</l>
     <l n="72">That it foretells us , always comes to pass .</l>
     <l n="73">Cataracts of declamation thunder here ;</l>
     <l n="74">There forests of no meaning spread the page ,</l>
     <l n="75">In which all comprehension wanders lost ;</l>
     <l n="76">While fields of pleasantry amuse us there</l>
     <l n="77">With merry descants on a nation 's woes .</l>
     <l n="78">The rest appears a wilderness of strange</l>
     <l n="79">But gay confusion ; roses for the cheeks</l>
     <l n="80">And lilies for the brows of faded age ,</l>
     <l n="81">Teeth for the toothless , ringlets for the bald ,</l>
     <l n="82">Heaven , earth , and ocean , plunder 'd of their sweets ,</l>
     <l n="83">Nectareous essences , Olympian dews ,</l>
     <l n="84">Sermons , and city feasts , and favourite airs ,</l>
     <l n="85">Æthereal journeys , submarine exploits ,</l>
     <l n="86">And Katerfelto , with his hair on end</l>
     <l n="87">At his own wonders , wondering for his bread .</l>
     <l n="88">‘ Tis pleasant , through the loopholes of retreat ,</l>
     <l n="89">To peep at such a world ; to see the stir</l>
     <l n="90">Of the great Babel , and not feel the crowd ;</l>
     <l n="91">To hear the roar she sends through all her gates</l>
     <l n="92">At a safe distance , where the dying sound</l>
     <l n="93">Falls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear .</l>
     <l n="94">Thus sitting , and surveying thus at ease</l>
     <l n="95">The globe and its concerns , I seem advanced</l>
     <l n="96">To some secure and more than mortal height ,</l>
     <l n="97">That liberates and exempts me from them all .</l>
     <l n="98">It turns submitted to my view , turns round</l>
     <l n="99">With all its generations ; I behold</l>
     <l n="100">The tumult and am still . The sound of war</l>
     <l n="101">Has lost its terrors ere it reaches me ;</l>
     <l n="102">Grieves , but alarms me not . I mourn the pride</l>
     <l n="103">And avarice that make man a wolf to man ;</l>
     <l n="104">Hear the faint echo of those brazen throats ,</l>
     <l n="105">By which he speaks the language of his heart ,</l>
     <l n="106">And sigh , but never tremble at the sound .</l>
     <l n="107">He travels and expatiates , as the bee</l>
     <l n="108">From flower to flower , so he from land to land ;</l>
     <l n="109">The manners , customs , policy of all</l>
     <l n="110">Pay contribution to the store he gleans ;</l>
     <l n="111">He sucks intelligence in every clime ,</l>
     <l n="112">And spreads the honey of his deep research</l>
     <l n="113">At his return — a rich repast for me .</l>
     <l n="114">He travels , and I too . I tread his deck ,</l>
     <l n="115">Ascend his topmast , through his peering eyes</l>
     <l n="116">Discover countries , with a kindred heart</l>
     <l n="117">Suffer his woes , and share in his escapes ;</l>
     <l n="118">While fancy , like the finger of a clock ,</l>
     <l n="119">Runs the great circuit , and is still at home .</l>
     <l n="120">O Winter , ruler of the inverted year ,</l>
     <l n="121">Thy scatter 'd hair with sleet like ashes fill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="122">Thy breath congeal 'd upon thy lips , thy cheeks</l>
     <l n="123">Fringed with a beard made white with other snows</l>
     <l n="124">Than those of age , thy forehead wrapp 'd in clouds ,</l>
     <l n="125">A leafless branch thy sceptre , and thy throne</l>
     <l n="126">A sliding car , indebted to no wheels ,</l>
     <l n="127">But urg 'd by storms along its slippery way ,</l>
     <l n="128">I love thee , all unlovely as thou seem'st ,</l>
     <l n="129">And dreaded as thou art ! Thou hold'st the sun</l>
     <l n="130">A prisoner in the yet undawning east ,</l>
     <l n="131">Shortening his journey between morn and noon ,</l>
     <l n="132">And hurrying him , impatient of his stay ,</l>
     <l n="133">Down to the rosy west ; but kindly still</l>
     <l n="134">Compensating his loss with added hours</l>
     <l n="135">Of social converse and instructive ease ,</l>
     <l n="136">And gathering , at short notice , in one group</l>
     <l n="137">The family dispersed , and fixing thought ,</l>
     <l n="138">Not less dispersed by daylight and its cares .</l>
     <l n="139">I crown thee king of intimate delights ,</l>
     <l n="140">Fireside enjoyments , homeborn happiness ,</l>
     <l n="141">And all the comforts that the lowly roof</l>
     <l n="142">Of undisturb 'd Retirement , and the hours</l>
     <l n="143">Of long uninterrupted evening know .</l>
     <l n="144">No rattling wheels stop short before these gates ;</l>
     <l n="145">No powder 'd pert proficient in the art</l>
     <l n="146">Of sounding an alarm assaults these doors</l>
     <l n="147">Till the street rings ; no stationary steeds</l>
     <l n="148">Cough their own knell , while , heedless of the sound ,</l>
     <l n="149">The silent circle fan themselves , and quake :</l>
     <l n="150">But here the needle plies its busy task ,</l>
     <l n="151">The pattern grows , the well-depicted flower ,</l>
     <l n="152">Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn ,</l>
     <l n="153">Unfolds its bosom ; buds , and leaves , and sprigs ,</l>
     <l n="154">And curling tendrils , gracefully disposed ,</l>
     <l n="155">Follow the nimble finger of the fair ;</l>
     <l n="156">A wreath , that cannot fade , of flowers that blow</l>
     <l n="157">With most success when all besides decay .</l>
     <l n="158">The poet 's or historian 's page by one</l>
     <l n="159">Made vocal for the amusement of the rest ;</l>
     <l n="160">The sprightly lyre , whose treasure of sweet sounds</l>
     <l n="161">The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out ;</l>
     <l n="162">And the clear voice , symphonious , yet distinct ,</l>
     <l n="163">And in the charming strife triumphant still ,</l>
     <l n="164">Beguile the night , and set a keener edge</l>
     <l n="165">On female industry : the threaded steel</l>
     <l n="166">Flies swiftly , and unfelt the task proceeds .</l>
     <l n="167">The volume closed , the customary rites</l>
     <l n="168">Of the last meal commence . A Roman meal ,</l>
     <l n="169">Such as the mistress of the world once found</l>
     <l n="170">Delicious , when her patriots of high note ,</l>
     <l n="171">Perhaps by moonlight , at their humble doors ,</l>
     <l n="172">And under an old oak 's domestic shade ,</l>
     <l n="173">Enjoy 'd , spare feast ! a radish and an egg !</l>
     <l n="174">Discourse ensues , not trivial , yet not dull ,</l>
     <l n="175">Nor such as with a frown forbids the play</l>
     <l n="176">Of fancy , or proscribes the sound of mirth :</l>
     <l n="177">Nor do we madly , like an impious world ,</l>
     <l n="178">Who deem religion frenzy , and the God</l>
     <l n="179">That made them an intruder on their joys ,</l>
     <l n="180">Start at his awful name , or deem his praise</l>
     <l n="181">A jarring note . Themes of a graver tone ,</l>
     <l n="182">Exciting oft our gratitude and love ,</l>
     <l n="183">While we retrace with Memory 's pointing wand ,</l>
     <l n="184">That calls the past to our exact review ,</l>
     <l n="185">The dangers we have ‘ scaped , the broken snare ,</l>
     <l n="186">The disappointed foe , deliverance found</l>
     <l n="187">Unlook 'd for , life preserved , and peace restored ,</l>
     <l n="188">Fruits of omnipotent eternal love .</l>
     <l n="189">O evenings worthy of the gods ! exclaim 'd</l>
     <l n="190">The Sabine bard . O evenings , I reply ,</l>
     <l n="191">More to be prized and coveted than yours ,</l>
     <l n="192">As more illumined , and with nobler truths ,</l>
     <l n="193">That I , and mine , and those we love , enjoy .</l>
     <l n="194">Is Winter hideous in a garb like this ?</l>
     <l n="195">Needs he the tragic fur , the smoke of lamps ,</l>
     <l n="196">The pent-up breath of an unsavoury throng ,</l>
     <l n="197">To thaw him into feeling ; or the smart</l>
     <l n="198">And snappish dialogue , that flippant wits</l>
     <l n="199">Call comedy , to prompt him with a smile ?</l>
     <l n="200">The self-complacent actor , when he views</l>
     <l n="201">( Stealing a sidelong glance at a full house )</l>
     <l n="202">The slope of faces from the floor to the roof</l>
     <l n="203">( As if one master spring controll 'd them all ,)</l>
     <l n="204">Relax 'd into a universal grin ,</l>
     <l n="205">Sees not a countenance there that speaks of joy</l>
     <l n="206">Half so refined or so sincere as ours .</l>
     <l n="207">Cards were superfluous here , with all the tricks</l>
     <l n="208">That idleness has ever yet contrived</l>
     <l n="209">To fill the void of an unfurnish 'd brain ,</l>
     <l n="210">To palliate dullness , and give time a shove .</l>
     <l n="211">Time , as he passes us , has a dove 's wing ,</l>
     <l n="212">Unsoil 'd , and swift , and of a silken sound ;</l>
     <l n="213">But the World 's Time is Time in masquerade !</l>
     <l n="214">Theirs , should I paint him , has his pinions fledged</l>
     <l n="215">With motley plumes ; and , where the peacock shows</l>
     <l n="216">His azure eyes , is tinctur 'd black and red</l>
     <l n="217">With spots quadrangular of diamond form ,</l>
     <l n="218">Ensanguined hearts , clubs typical of strife ,</l>
     <l n="219">And spades , the emblem of untimely graves .</l>
     <l n="220">What should be , and what was an hour-glass once ,</l>
     <l n="221">Becomes a dice-box , and a billiard mace</l>
     <l n="222">Well does the work of his destructive scythe .</l>
     <l n="223">Thus deck 'd , he charms a world whom Fashion blinds</l>
     <l n="224">To his true worth , most pleased when idle most ;</l>
     <l n="225">Whose only happy are their wasted hours .</l>
     <l n="226">E'en misses , at whose age their mothers wore</l>
     <l n="227">The backstring and the bib , assume the dress</l>
     <l n="228">Of womanhood , fit pupils in the school</l>
     <l n="229">Of card-devoted Time , and , night by night</l>
     <l n="230">Placed at some vacant corner of the board ,</l>
     <l n="231">Learn every trick , and soon play all the game .</l>
     <l n="232">But truce with censure . Roving as I rove ,</l>
     <l n="233">Where shall I find an end , or how proceed ?</l>
     <l n="234">As he that travels far oft turns aside ,</l>
     <l n="235">To view some rugged rock or mouldering tower ,</l>
     <l n="236">Which seen delights him not ; then , coming home ,</l>
     <l n="237">Describes and prints it , that the world may know</l>
     <l n="238">How far he went for what was nothing worth ;</l>
     <l n="239">So I , with brush in hand and pallet spread ,</l>
     <l n="240">With colours mix 'd for a far different use ,</l>
     <l n="241">Paint cards , and dolls , and every idle thing</l>
     <l n="242">That Fancy finds in her excursive flights .</l>
     <l n="243">Come , Evening , once again , season of peace ;</l>
     <l n="244">Return , sweet Evening , and continue long !</l>
     <l n="245">Methinks I see thee in the streaky west ,</l>
     <l n="246">With matron step slow moving , while the Night</l>
     <l n="247">Treads on thy sweeping train ; one hand employ 'd</l>
     <l n="248">In letting fall the curtain of repose</l>
     <l n="249">On bird and beast , the other charged for man</l>
     <l n="250">With sweet oblivion of the cares of day :</l>
     <l n="251">Not sumptuously adorn 'd , not needing aid ,</l>
     <l n="252">Like homely featured Night , of clustering gems ;</l>
     <l n="253">A star or two , just twinkling on thy brow ,</l>
     <l n="254">Suffices thee ; save that the moon is thine</l>
     <l n="255">No less than hers , not worn indeed on high</l>
     <l n="256">With ostentatious pageantry , but set</l>
     <l n="257">With modest grandeur in thy purple zone ,</l>
     <l n="258">Resplendent less , but of an ampler round .</l>
     <l n="259">Come then , and thou shalt find thy votary calm ,</l>
     <l n="260">Or make me so . Composure is thy gift :</l>
     <l n="261">And , whether I devote thy gentle hours</l>
     <l n="262">To books , to music , or the poet 's toil ;</l>
     <l n="263">To weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit ;</l>
     <l n="264">Or twining silken threads round ivory reels ,</l>
     <l n="265">When they command whom man was born to please ;</l>
     <l n="266">I slight thee not , but make thee welcome still</l>
     <l n="267">Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze</l>
     <l n="268">With lights , by clear reflection multiplied</l>
     <l n="269">From many a mirror , in which he of Gath ,</l>
     <l n="270">Goliath , might have seen his giant bulk</l>
     <l n="271">Whole without stooping , towering crest and all ,</l>
     <l n="272">My pleasures too begin . But me perhaps</l>
     <l n="273">The glowing hearth may satisfy awhile</l>
     <l n="274">With faint illumination , that uplifts</l>
     <l n="275">The shadows to the ceiling , there by fits</l>
     <l n="276">Dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame .</l>
     <l n="277">Not undelightful is an hour to me</l>
     <l n="278">So spent in parlour twilight : such a gloom</l>
     <l n="279">Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind ,</l>
     <l n="280">The mind contemplative , with some new theme</l>
     <l n="281">Pregnant , or indisposed alike to all .</l>
     <l n="282">Laugh ye , who boast your more mercurial powers ,</l>
     <l n="283">That never felt a stupor , know no pause ,</l>
     <l n="284">Nor need one ; I am conscious , and confess ,</l>
     <l n="285">Fearless , a soul that does not always think .</l>
     <l n="286">Me oft has Fancy ludicrous and wild</l>
     <l n="287">Soothed with a waking dream of houses , towers ,</l>
     <l n="288">Trees , churches , and strange visages , express 'd</l>
     <l n="289">In the red cinders , while with poring eye</l>
     <l n="290">I gazed , myself creating what I saw .</l>
     <l n="291">Nor less amused , have I quiescent watch 'd</l>
     <l n="292">The sooty films that play upon the bars ,</l>
     <l n="293">Pendulous and foreboding , in the view</l>
     <l n="294">Of superstition , prophesying still ,</l>
     <l n="295">Though still deceived , some stranger 's near approach .</l>
     <l n="296">‘ Tis thus the understanding takes repose</l>
     <l n="297">In indolent vacuity of thought ,</l>
     <l n="298">And sleeps and is refresh 'd . Meanwhile the face</l>
     <l n="299">Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask</l>
     <l n="300">Of deep deliberation , as the man</l>
     <l n="301">Were task 'd to his full strength , absorb 'd and lost .</l>
     <l n="302">Thus oft , reclined at ease , I lose an hour</l>
     <l n="303">At evening , till at length the freezing blast ,</l>
     <l n="304">That sweeps the bolted shutter , summons home</l>
     <l n="305">The recollected powers ; and , snapping short</l>
     <l n="306">The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves</l>
     <l n="307">Her brittle toils , restores me to myself .</l>
     <l n="308">How calm is my recess ; and how the frost ,</l>
     <l n="309">Raging abroad , and the rough wind endear</l>
     <l n="310">The silence and the warmth enjoy 'd within !</l>
     <l n="311">I saw the woods and fields at close of day</l>
     <l n="312">A variegated show ; the meadows green ,</l>
     <l n="313">Though faded ; and the lands , where lately waved ,</l>
     <l n="314">The golden harvest , of a mellow brown ,</l>
     <l n="315">Upturn 'd so lately by the forceful share .</l>
     <l n="316">I saw far off the weedy fallows smile</l>
     <l n="317">With verdure not unprofitable , grazed</l>
     <l n="318">By flocks , fast feeding , and selecting each</l>
     <l n="319">His favourite herb ; while all the leafless groves ,</l>
     <l n="320">That skirt the horizon , wore a sable hue ,</l>
     <l n="321">Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve .</l>
     <l n="322">To-morrow brings a change , a total change !</l>
     <l n="323">Which even now , though silently perform 'd ,</l>
     <l n="324">And slowly , and by most unfelt , the face</l>
     <l n="325">Of universal nature undergoes .</l>
     <l n="326">Fast falls a fleecy shower : the downy flakes</l>
     <l n="327">Descending , and with never ceasing lapse ,</l>
     <l n="328">Softly alighting upon all below ,</l>
     <l n="329">Assimilate all objects . Earth receives</l>
     <l n="330">Gladly the thickening mantle ; and the green</l>
     <l n="331">And tender blade , that fear 'd the chilling blast ,</l>
     <l n="332">Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil .</l>
     <l n="333">In such a world , so thorny , and where none</l>
     <l n="334">Finds happiness unblighted ; or , if found ,</l>
     <l n="335">Without some thistly sorrow at its side ;</l>
     <l n="336">It seems the part of wisdom , and no sin</l>
     <l n="337">Against the law of love , to measure lots</l>
     <l n="338">With less distinguished than ourselves ; that thus</l>
     <l n="339">We may with patience bear our moderate ills ,</l>
     <l n="340">And sympathize with others suffering more .</l>
     <l n="341">Ill fares the traveller now , and he that stalks</l>
     <l n="342">In ponderous boots beside his reeking team .</l>
     <l n="343">The wain goes heavily , impeded sore</l>
     <l n="344">By congregated loads , adhering close</l>
     <l n="345">To the clogg 'd wheels ; and in its sluggish pace</l>
     <l n="346">Noiseless appears a moving hill of snow .</l>
     <l n="347">The toiling steeds expand the nostril wide ,</l>
     <l n="348">While every breath , by respiration strong</l>
     <l n="349">Forced downward , is consolidated soon</l>
     <l n="350">Upon their jutting chests . He , form 'd to bear</l>
     <l n="351">The pelting brunt of the tempestuous night ,</l>
     <l n="352">With half-shut eyes , and pucker 'd cheeks , and teeth</l>
     <l n="353">Presented bare against the storm , plods on .</l>
     <l n="354">One hand secures his hat , save when with both</l>
     <l n="355">He brandishes his pliant length of whip ,</l>
     <l n="356">Resounding oft , and never heard in vain .</l>
     <l n="357">O happy ; and , in my account , denied</l>
     <l n="358">That sensibility of pain with which</l>
     <l n="359">Refinement is endued , thrice happy thou !</l>
     <l n="360">Thy frame , robust and hardy , feels indeed</l>
     <l n="361">The piercing cold , but feels it unimpair 'd .</l>
     <l n="362">The learned finger never need explore</l>
     <l n="363">Thy vigorous pulse ; and the unhealthful east ,</l>
     <l n="364">That breathes the spleen , and searches every bone</l>
     <l n="365">Of the infirm , is wholesome air to thee .</l>
     <l n="366">Thy days roll on exempt from household care ;</l>
     <l n="367">Thy wagon is thy wife , and the poor beasts ,</l>
     <l n="368">That drag the dull companion to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="369">Thine helpless charge , dependent on thy care .</l>
     <l n="370">Ah , treat them kindly ! rude as thou appear'st ,</l>
     <l n="371">Yet show that thou hast mercy ! which the great ,</l>
     <l n="372">With needless hurry whirl 'd from place to place ,</l>
     <l n="373">Humane as they would seem , not always show .</l>
     <l n="374">Poor , yet industrious , modest , quiet , neat ,</l>
     <l n="375">Such claim compassion in a night like this ,</l>
     <l n="376">And have a friend in every feeling heart .</l>
     <l n="377">Warm 'd , while it lasts , by labour all day long</l>
     <l n="378">They brave the season , and yet find at eve ,</l>
     <l n="379">Ill clad , and fed but sparely , time to cool .</l>
     <l n="380">The frugal housewife trembles when she lights</l>
     <l n="381">Her scanty stock of brushwood , blazing clear ,</l>
     <l n="382">But dying soon , like all terrestrial joys .</l>
     <l n="383">The few small embers left she nurses well ;</l>
     <l n="384">And , while her infant race , with outspread hands ,</l>
     <l n="385">And crowded knees , sit cowering o'er the sparks ,</l>
     <l n="386">Retires , content to quake , so they be warm 'd .</l>
     <l n="387">The man feels least , as more inured than she</l>
     <l n="388">To winter , and the current in his veins</l>
     <l n="389">More briskly moved by his severer toil ;</l>
     <l n="390">Yet he too finds his own distress in theirs .</l>
     <l n="391">The taper soon extinguish 'd , which I saw</l>
     <l n="392">Dangled along at the cold finger 's end</l>
     <l n="393">Just when the day declined ; and the brown loaf</l>
     <l n="394">Lodged on the shelf , half eaten without sauce</l>
     <l n="395">Of savoury cheese , or butter , costlier still ;</l>
     <l n="396">Sleep seems their only refuge : for , alas ,</l>
     <l n="397">Where penury is felt the thought is chained ,</l>
     <l n="398">And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few !</l>
     <l n="399">With all this thrift they thrive not . All the care ,</l>
     <l n="400">Ingenious Parsimony takes , but just</l>
     <l n="401">Saves the small inventory , bed , and stool ,</l>
     <l n="402">Skillet , and old carved chest , from public sale .</l>
     <l n="403">They live , and live without extorted alms</l>
     <l n="404">From grudging hands ; but other boast have none</l>
     <l n="405">To soothe their honest pride , that scorns to beg ,</l>
     <l n="406">Nor comfort else , but in their mutual love .</l>
     <l n="407">I praise you much , ye meek and patient pair ,</l>
     <l n="408">For ye are worthy ; choosing rather far</l>
     <l n="409">A dry but independent crust , hard earn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="410">And eaten with a sigh , than to endure</l>
     <l n="411">The rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs</l>
     <l n="412">Of knaves in office , partial in the work</l>
     <l n="413">Of distribution ; liberal of their aid</l>
     <l n="414">To clamorous importunity in rags ,</l>
     <l n="415">But ofttimes deaf to suppliants , who would blush</l>
     <l n="416">To wear a tatter 'd garb however coarse ,</l>
     <l n="417">Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth :</l>
     <l n="418">These ask with painful shyness , and , refused</l>
     <l n="419">Because deserving , silently retire !</l>
     <l n="420">But be ye of good courage ! Time itself</l>
     <l n="421">Shall much befriend you . Time shall give increase ;</l>
     <l n="422">And all your numerous progeny , well train 'd ,</l>
     <l n="423">But helpless , in few years shall find their hands ,</l>
     <l n="424">And labour too . Meanwhile ye shall not want</l>
     <l n="425">What , conscious of your virtues , we can spare ,</l>
     <l n="426">Nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send .</l>
     <l n="427">I mean the man who , when the distant poor</l>
     <l n="428">Need help , denies them nothing but his name .</l>
     <l n="429">But poverty with most , who whimper forth</l>
     <l n="430">Their long complaints , is self-inflicted woe ;</l>
     <l n="431">The effect of laziness or sottish waste .</l>
     <l n="432">Now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad</l>
     <l n="433">For plunder ; much solicitous how best</l>
     <l n="434">He may compensate for a day of sloth</l>
     <l n="435">By works of darkness and nocturnal wrong .</l>
     <l n="436">Woe to the gardener 's pale , the farmer 's hedge ,</l>
     <l n="437">Plash 'd neatly , and secured with driven stakes</l>
     <l n="438">Deep in the loamy bank . Uptorn by strength ,</l>
     <l n="439">Resistless in so bad a cause , but lame</l>
     <l n="440">To better deeds , he bundles up the spoil ,</l>
     <l n="441">An ass 's burden , and , when laden most</l>
     <l n="442">And heaviest , light of foot steals fast away ,</l>
     <l n="443">Nor does the boarded hovel better guard</l>
     <l n="444">The well-stack 'd pile of riven logs and roots</l>
     <l n="445">From his pernicious force . Nor will he leave</l>
     <l n="446">Unwrench 'd the door , however well secured ,</l>
     <l n="447">Where Chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps</l>
     <l n="448">In unsuspecting pomp . Twitch 'd from the perch ,</l>
     <l n="449">He gives the princely bird , with all his wives ,</l>
     <l n="450">To his voracious bag , struggling in vain ,</l>
     <l n="451">And loudly wondering at the sudden change .</l>
     <l n="452">Nor this to feed his own . ‘ Twere some excuse ,</l>
     <l n="453">Did pity of their sufferings warp aside</l>
     <l n="454">His principle , and tempt him into sin</l>
     <l n="455">For their support , so destitute . But they</l>
     <l n="456">Neglected pine at home ; themselves , as more</l>
     <l n="457">Exposed than others , with less scruple made</l>
     <l n="458">His victims , robb 'd of their defenceless all .</l>
     <l n="459">Cruel is all he does . ‘ Tis quenchless thirst</l>
     <l n="460">Of ruinous ebriety that prompts</l>
     <l n="461">His every action , and imbrutes the man .</l>
     <l n="462">O for a law to noose the villain 's neck</l>
     <l n="463">Who starves his own ; who persecutes the blood</l>
     <l n="464">He gave them in his children 's veins , and hates</l>
     <l n="465">And wrongs the woman he has sworn to love !</l>
     <l n="466">Pass where we may , through city or through town ,</l>
     <l n="467">Village , or hamlet , of this merry land ,</l>
     <l n="468">Though lean and beggar 'd , every twentieth pace</l>
     <l n="469">Conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff</l>
     <l n="470">Of stale debauch , forth issuing from the styes</l>
     <l n="471">That law has licensed , as makes temperance reel .</l>
     <l n="472">There sit , involved and lost in curling clouds</l>
     <l n="473">Of Indian fume , and guzzling deep , the boor ,</l>
     <l n="474">The lackey , and the groom : the craftsman there</l>
     <l n="475">Takes a Lethean leave of all his toil ;</l>
     <l n="476">Smith , cobbler , joiner , he that plies the shears ,</l>
     <l n="477">And he that kneads the dough ; all loud alike ,</l>
     <l n="478">All learned , and all drunk ! the fiddle screams</l>
     <l n="479">Plaintive and piteous , as it wept and wailed</l>
     <l n="480">Its wasted tones and harmony unheard :</l>
     <l n="481">Fierce the dispute , whate'er the theme ; while she ,</l>
     <l n="482">Fell Discord , arbitress of such debate ,</l>
     <l n="483">Perch 'd on the sign-post , holds with even hand</l>
     <l n="484">Her undecisive scales . In this she lays</l>
     <l n="485">A weight of ignorance ; in that , of pride ;</l>
     <l n="486">And smiles delighted with the eternal poise .</l>
     <l n="487">Dire is the frequent curse , and its twin sound ,</l>
     <l n="488">The cheek distending oath , not to be praised</l>
     <l n="489">As ornamental , musical , polite ,</l>
     <l n="490">Like those which modern senators employ ,</l>
     <l n="491">Whose oath is rhetoric , and who swear for fame !</l>
     <l n="492">Behold the schools in which plebeian minds ,</l>
     <l n="493">Once simple , are initiated in arts ,</l>
     <l n="494">Which some may practise with politer grace ,</l>
     <l n="495">But none with readier skill !— ‘ tis here they learn</l>
     <l n="496">The road that leads from competence and peace</l>
     <l n="497">To indigence and rapine ; till at last</l>
     <l n="498">Society , grown weary of the load ,</l>
     <l n="499">Shakes her encumber 'd lap , and casts them out .</l>
     <l n="500">But censure profits little : vain the attempt</l>
     <l n="501">To advertise in verse a public pest ,</l>
     <l n="502">That , like the filth with which the peasant feeds</l>
     <l n="503">His hungry acres , stinks , and is of use .</l>
     <l n="504">The excise is fatten 'd with the rich result</l>
     <l n="505">Of all this riot ; and ten thousand casks ,</l>
     <l n="506">For ever dribbling out their base contents ,</l>
     <l n="507">Touch 'd by the Midas finger of the state ,</l>
     <l n="508">Bleed gold for ministers to sport away .</l>
     <l n="509">Drink , and be mad then ; ‘ tis your country bids !</l>
     <l n="510">Gloriously drunk , obey the important call !</l>
     <l n="511">Her cause demands the assistance of your throats ;—</l>
     <l n="512">Ye all can swallow , and she asks no more .</l>
     <l n="513">Would I had fallen upon those happier days ,</l>
     <l n="514">That poets celebrate ; those golden times ,</l>
     <l n="515">And those Arcadian scenes , that Maro sings ,</l>
     <l n="516">And Sidney , warbler of poetic prose .</l>
     <l n="517">Nymphs were Dianas then , and swains had hearts</l>
     <l n="518">That felt their virtues : Innocence , it seems ,</l>
     <l n="519">From courts dismiss 'd , found shelter in the groves ;</l>
     <l n="520">The footsteps of Simplicity , impress 'd</l>
     <l n="521">Upon the yielding herbage ( so they sing )</l>
     <l n="522">Then were not all effaced : then speech profane</l>
     <l n="523">And manners profligate were rarely found ,</l>
     <l n="524">Observed as prodigies , and soon reclaim 'd .</l>
     <l n="525">Vain wish ! those days were never : airy dreams</l>
     <l n="526">Sat for the picture : and the poet 's hand ,</l>
     <l n="527">Imparting substance to an empty shade ,</l>
     <l n="528">Imposed a gay delirium for a truth .</l>
     <l n="529">Grant it :— I still must envy them an age</l>
     <l n="530">That favour 'd such a dream ; in days like these</l>
     <l n="531">Impossible , when Virtue is so scarce ,</l>
     <l n="532">That to suppose a scene where she presides ,</l>
     <l n="533">Is tramontane , and stumbles all belief .</l>
     <l n="534">No : we are polish 'd now ! The rural lass ,</l>
     <l n="535">Whom once her virgin modesty and grace ,</l>
     <l n="536">Her artless manners , and her neat attire ,</l>
     <l n="537">So dignified , that she was hardly less</l>
     <l n="538">Than the fair shepherdess of old romance ,</l>
     <l n="539">Is seen no more . The character is lost !</l>
     <l n="540">Her head , adorn 'd with lappets pinn 'd aloft ,</l>
     <l n="541">And ribands streaming gay , superbly raised ,</l>
     <l n="542">And magnified beyond all human size ,</l>
     <l n="543">Indebted to some smart wig-weaver 's hand</l>
     <l n="544">For more than half the tresses it sustains ;</l>
     <l n="545">Her elbows ruffled , and her tottering form</l>
     <l n="546">Ill propp 'd upon French heels ; she might be deem 'd</l>
     <l n="547">( But that the basket dangling on her arm</l>
     <l n="548">Interprets her more truly ) of a rank</l>
     <l n="549">Too proud for dairy work , or sale of eggs .</l>
     <l n="550">Expect her soon with footboy at her heels ,</l>
     <l n="551">No longer blushing for her awkward load ,</l>
     <l n="552">Her train and her umbrella all her care !</l>
     <l n="553">The town has tinged the country ; and the stain</l>
     <l n="554">Appears a spot upon a vestal 's robe ,</l>
     <l n="555">The worse for what it soils . The fashion runs</l>
     <l n="556">Down into scenes still rural ; but , alas !</l>
     <l n="557">Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now !</l>
     <l n="558">Time was when in the pastoral retreat</l>
     <l n="559">The unguarded door was safe ; men did not watch</l>
     <l n="560">To invade another 's right , or guard their own .</l>
     <l n="561">Then sleep was undisturb 'd by fear , unscared</l>
     <l n="562">By drunken howlings ; and the chilling tale</l>
     <l n="563">Of midnight murder was a wonder heard</l>
     <l n="564">With doubtful credit , told to frighten babes .</l>
     <l n="565">But farewell now to unsuspicious nights ,</l>
     <l n="566">And slumbers unalarm 'd ! Now , ere you sleep ,</l>
     <l n="567">See that your polish 'd arms be prim 'd with care ,</l>
     <l n="568">And drop the night bolt ;— ruffians are abroad ;</l>
     <l n="569">And the first ‘ larum of the cock 's shrill throat</l>
     <l n="570">May prove a trumpet , summoning your ear</l>
     <l n="571">To horrid sounds of hostile feet within .</l>
     <l n="572">E'en daylight has its dangers ; and the walk</l>
     <l n="573">Through pathless wastes and woods , unconscious once</l>
     <l n="574">Of other tenants than melodious birds ,</l>
     <l n="575">Or harmless flocks , is hazardous and bold .</l>
     <l n="576">Lamented change ! to which full many a cause</l>
     <l n="577">Inveterate , hopeless of a cure , conspires .</l>
     <l n="578">The course of human things from good to ill ,</l>
     <l n="579">From ill to worse , is fatal , never fails .</l>
     <l n="580">Increase of power begets increase of wealth ;</l>
     <l n="581">Wealth luxury , and luxury excess ;</l>
     <l n="582">Excess , the scrofulous and itchy plague ,</l>
     <l n="583">That seizes first the opulent , descends</l>
     <l n="584">To the next rank contagious , and in time</l>
     <l n="585">Taints downwarn all the graduated scale</l>
     <l n="586">Of order , from the chariot to the plough .</l>
     <l n="587">The rich , and they that have an arm to check</l>
     <l n="588">The licence of the lowest in degree ,</l>
     <l n="589">Desert their office ; and themselves , intent</l>
     <l n="590">On pleasure , haunt the capital , and thus</l>
     <l n="591">To all the violence of lawless hands</l>
     <l n="592">Resign the scenes their presence might protect .</l>
     <l n="593">Authority herself not seldom sleeps ,</l>
     <l n="594">Though resident , and witness of the wrong .</l>
     <l n="595">The plump convivial parson often bears</l>
     <l n="596">The magisterial sword in vain , and lays</l>
     <l n="597">His reverence and his worship both to rest</l>
     <l n="598">On the same cushion of habitual sloth .</l>
     <l n="599">Perhaps timidity restrains his arm ;</l>
     <l n="600">When he should strike he trembles , and sets free ,</l>
     <l n="601">Himself enslaved by terror of the band ,</l>
     <l n="602">The audacious convict , whom he dares not bind .</l>
     <l n="603">Perhaps , though by profession ghostly pure ,</l>
     <l n="604">He too may have his vice , and sometimes prove</l>
     <l n="605">Less dainty than becomes his grave outside</l>
     <l n="606">In lucrative concerns . Examine well</l>
     <l n="607">His milk-white hand ; the palm is hardly clean —</l>
     <l n="608">But here and there an ugly smutch appears .</l>
     <l n="609">Foh ! ‘ twas a bribe that left it : he has touch 'd</l>
     <l n="610">Corruption ! Whoso seeks an audit here</l>
     <l n="611">Propitious , pays his tribute , game or fish ,</l>
     <l n="612">Wildfowl or venison , and his errand speeds .</l>
     <l n="613">But faster far , and more than all the rest ,</l>
     <l n="614">A noble cause , which none , who bears a spark</l>
     <l n="615">Of public virtue , ever wish 'd removed ,</l>
     <l n="616">Works the deplored and mischievous effect .</l>
     <l n="617">‘ Tis universal soldiership has stabb 'd</l>
     <l n="618">The heart of merit in the meaner class .</l>
     <l n="619">Arms , through the vanity and brainless rage</l>
     <l n="620">Of those that bear them , in whatever cause ,</l>
     <l n="621">Seem most at variance with all moral good ,</l>
     <l n="622">And incompatible with serious thought .</l>
     <l n="623">The clown , the child of nature , without guile ,</l>
     <l n="624">Blest with an infant 's ignorance of all</l>
     <l n="625">But his own simple pleasures ; now and then</l>
     <l n="626">A wrestling match , a foot-race , or a fair ;</l>
     <l n="627">Is balloted , and trembles at the news :</l>
     <l n="628">Sheepish he doffs his hat , and mumbling swears</l>
     <l n="629">A bible-oath to be whate'er they please ,</l>
     <l n="630">To do he knows not what . The task perform 'd ,</l>
     <l n="631">That instant he becomes the serjeant 's care ,</l>
     <l n="632">His pupil , and his torment , and his jest .</l>
     <l n="633">His awkward gait , his introverted toes ,</l>
     <l n="634">Bent knees , round shoulders , and dejected looks ,</l>
     <l n="635">Procure him many a curse . By slow degrees</l>
     <l n="636">Unapt to learn , and form 'd of stubborn stuff ,</l>
     <l n="637">He yet by slow degrees puts off himself ,</l>
     <l n="638">Grows conscious of a change , and likes it well :</l>
     <l n="639">He stands erect ; his slouch becomes a walk ;</l>
     <l n="640">He steps right onward , martial in his air ,</l>
     <l n="641">His form , and movement ; is as smart above</l>
     <l n="642">As meal and larded locks can make him ; wears</l>
     <l n="643">His hat , or his plumed helmet , with a grace ;</l>
     <l n="644">And , his three years of heroship expired ,</l>
     <l n="645">Returns indignant to the slighted plough .</l>
     <l n="646">He hates the field , in which no fife or drum</l>
     <l n="647">Attends him ; drives his cattle to a march ;</l>
     <l n="648">And sighs for the smart comrades he has left .</l>
     <l n="649">‘ Twere well if his exterior change were all —</l>
     <l n="650">But with his clumsy port the wretch has lost</l>
     <l n="651">His ignorance and harmless manners too .</l>
     <l n="652">To swear , to game , to drink ; to show at home ,</l>
     <l n="653">By lewdness , idleness , and sabbath breach ,</l>
     <l n="654">The great proficiency he made abroad ;</l>
     <l n="655">To astonish and to grieve his gazing friends ;</l>
     <l n="656">To break some maiden 's and his mother 's heart ;</l>
     <l n="657">To be a pest where he was useful once ;</l>
     <l n="658">Are his sole aim , and all his glory now .</l>
     <l n="659">Man in society is like a flower</l>
     <l n="660">Blown in its native bed : ‘ tis there alone</l>
     <l n="661">His faculties , expanded in full bloom ,</l>
     <l n="662">Shine out ; there only reach their proper use .</l>
     <l n="663">But man , associated and leagued with man</l>
     <l n="664">By regal warrant , or self-join 'd by bond</l>
     <l n="665">For interest sake , or swarming into clans</l>
     <l n="666">Beneath one head for purposes of war ,</l>
     <l n="667">Like flowers selected from the rest , and bound</l>
     <l n="668">And bundled close to fill some crowded vase ,</l>
     <l n="669">Fades rapidly , and , by compression marr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="670">Contracts defilement not to be endured .</l>
     <l n="671">Hence charter 'd boroughs are such public plagues ;</l>
     <l n="672">And burghers , men immaculate perhaps</l>
     <l n="673">In all their private functions , once combined ,</l>
     <l n="674">Become a loathsome body , only fit</l>
     <l n="675">For dissolution , hurtful to the main .</l>
     <l n="676">Hence merchants , unimpeachable of sin</l>
     <l n="677">Against the charities of domestic life ,</l>
     <l n="678">Incorporated , seem at once to lose</l>
     <l n="679">Their nature ; and , disclaiming all regard</l>
     <l n="680">For mercy and the common rights of man ,</l>
     <l n="681">Build factories with blood , conducting trade</l>
     <l n="682">At the sword 's point , and dyeing the white robe</l>
     <l n="683">Of innocent commercial Justice red .</l>
     <l n="684">Hence too the field of glory , as the world</l>
     <l n="685">Misdeems it , dazzled by its bright array ,</l>
     <l n="686">With all its majesty of thundering pomp ,</l>
     <l n="687">Enchanting music and immortal wreaths ,</l>
     <l n="688">Is but a school , where thoughtlessness is taught</l>
     <l n="689">On principle , where foppery atones</l>
     <l n="690">For folly , gallantry for every vice .</l>
     <l n="691">But slighted as it is , and by the great</l>
     <l n="692">Abandon 'd , and , which still I more regret ,</l>
     <l n="693">Infected with the manners and the modes</l>
     <l n="694">It knew not once , the country wins me still .</l>
     <l n="695">I never framed a wish , or form 'd a plan ,</l>
     <l n="696">That flatter 'd me with hopes of earthly bliss ,</l>
     <l n="697">But there I laid the scene . There early stray 'd</l>
     <l n="698">My fancy , ere yet liberty of choice</l>
     <l n="699">Had found me , or the hope of being free .</l>
     <l n="700">My very dreams were rural ; rural too</l>
     <l n="701">The firstborn efforts of my youthful muse ,</l>
     <l n="702">Sportive , and jingling her poetic bells</l>
     <l n="703">Ere yet her ear was mistress of their powers .</l>
     <l n="704">No bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned</l>
     <l n="705">To Nature 's praises . Heroes and their feats</l>
     <l n="706">Fatigued me , never weary of the pipe</l>
     <l n="707">Of Tityrus , assembling , as he sang ,</l>
     <l n="708">The rustic throng beneath his favorite beech .</l>
     <l n="709">Then Milton had indeed a poet 's charms :</l>
     <l n="710">New to my taste , his Paradise surpass 'd</l>
     <l n="711">The struggling efforts of my boyish tongue</l>
     <l n="712">To speak its excellence . I danced for joy .</l>
     <l n="713">I marvell 'd much that , at so ripe an age</l>
     <l n="714">As twice seven years , his beauties had then first</l>
     <l n="715">Engaged my wonder ; and admiring still ,</l>
     <l n="716">And still admiring , with regret supposed</l>
     <l n="717">The joy half lost , because not sooner found .</l>
     <l n="718">There too , enamour 'd of the life I loved ,</l>
     <l n="719">Pathetic in its praise , in its pursuit</l>
     <l n="720">Determined , and possessing it at last ,</l>
     <l n="721">With transports , such as favour 'd lovers feel ,</l>
     <l n="722">I studied , prized , and wish 'd that I had known</l>
     <l n="723">Ingenious Cowley ! and , though now reclaim 'd</l>
     <l n="724">By modern lights from an erroneous taste ,</l>
     <l n="725">I cannot but lament thy splendid wit</l>
     <l n="726">Entangled in the cobwebs of the schools .</l>
     <l n="727">I still revere thee , courtly though retired ;</l>
     <l n="728">Though stretch 'd at ease in Chertsey 's silent bowers ,</l>
     <l n="729">Not unemploy 'd ; and finding rich amends</l>
     <l n="730">For a lost world in solitude and verse .</l>
     <l n="731">‘ Tis born with all : the love of Nature 's works</l>
     <l n="732">Is an ingredient in the compound man ,</l>
     <l n="733">Infused at the creation of the kind .</l>
     <l n="734">And , though the Almighty Maker has throughout</l>
     <l n="735">Discriminated each from each , by strokes</l>
     <l n="736">And touches of his hand , with so much art</l>
     <l n="737">Diversified , that two were never found</l>
     <l n="738">Twins at all points — yet this obtains in all ,</l>
     <l n="739">That all discern a beauty in his works ,</l>
     <l n="740">And all can taste them : minds that have been form 'd</l>
     <l n="741">And tutor 'd , with a relish more exact ,</l>
     <l n="742">But none without some relish , none unmoved .</l>
     <l n="743">It is a flame that dies not even there</l>
     <l n="744">Where nothing feeds it : neither business , crowds ,</l>
     <l n="745">Nor habits of luxurious city life ,</l>
     <l n="746">Whatever else they smother of true worth</l>
     <l n="747">In human bosoms , quench it or abate .</l>
     <l n="748">The villas with which London stands begirt</l>
     <l n="749">Like a swarth Indian with his belt of beads</l>
     <l n="750">Prove it . A breath of unadulterate air ,</l>
     <l n="751">The glimpse of a green pasture , how they cheer</l>
     <l n="752">The citizen , and brace his languid frame !</l>
     <l n="753">E'en in the stifling bosom of the town</l>
     <l n="754">A garden , in which nothing thrives , has charms</l>
     <l n="755">That soothe the rich possessor ; much consoled ,</l>
     <l n="756">That here and there some sprigs of mournful mint ,</l>
     <l n="757">Of nightshade , or valerian , grace the well</l>
     <l n="758">He cultivates . These serve him with a hint</l>
     <l n="759">That nature lives ; that sight-refreshing green</l>
     <l n="760">Is still the livery she delights to wear ,</l>
     <l n="761">Though sickly samples of the exuberant whole .</l>
     <l n="762">What are the casements lined with creeping herbs ,</l>
     <l n="763">The prouder sashes fronted with a range</l>
     <l n="764">Of orange , myrtle , or the fragrant weed ,</l>
     <l n="765">The Frenchman 's darling ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 813 ]</span>are they not all proofs</l>
     <l n="766">That man , immured in cities , still retains</l>
     <l n="767">His inborn inextinguishable thirst</l>
     <l n="768">Of rural scenes , compensating his loss</l>
     <l n="769">By supplemental shifts , the best he may</l>
     <l n="770">The most unfurnish 'd with the means of life ,</l>
     <l n="771">And they that never pass their brick-wall bounds ,</l>
     <l n="772">To range the fields and treat their lungs with air ,</l>
     <l n="773">Yet feel the burning instinct : over head</l>
     <l n="774">Suspend their crazy boxes , planted thick ,</l>
     <l n="775">And water 'd duly . There the pitcher stands ,</l>
     <l n="776">A fragment , and the spoutless teapot there ;</l>
     <l n="777">Sad witnesses how close-pent man regrets</l>
     <l n="778">The country , with what ardour he contrives</l>
     <l n="779">A peep at Nature , when he can no more .</l>
     <l n="780">Hail , therefore , patroness of health and ease ,</l>
     <l n="781">And contemplation , heart-consoling joys ,</l>
     <l n="782">And harmless pleasures , in the throng 'd abode</l>
     <l n="783">Of multitudes unknown ! hail , rural life !</l>
     <l n="784">Address himself who will to the pursuit</l>
     <l n="785">Of honours , or emolument , or fame ;</l>
     <l n="786">I shall not add myself to such a chase ,</l>
     <l n="787">Thwart his attempts , or envy his success .</l>
     <l n="788">Some must be great . Great offices will have</l>
     <l n="789">Great talents . And God gives to every man</l>
     <l n="790">The virtue , temper , understanding , taste ,</l>
     <l n="791">That lifts him into life , and lets him fall</l>
     <l n="792">Just in the niche he was ordain 'd to fill .</l>
     <l n="793">To the deliverer of an injured land</l>
     <l n="794">He gives a tongue to enlarge upon , a heart</l>
     <l n="795">To feel , and courage to redress her wrongs ;</l>
     <l n="796">To monarchs dignity ; to judges sense ;</l>
     <l n="797">To artists ingenuity and skill ;</l>
     <l n="798">To me an unambitious mind , content</l>
     <l n="799">In the low vale of life , that early felt</l>
     <l n="800">A wish for ease and leisure , and ere long</l>
     <l n="801">Found here that leisure and that ease I wish 'd .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">‘ Tis morning ; and the sun , with ruddy orb</l>
     <l n="2">Ascending , fires the horizon ; while the clouds ,</l>
     <l n="3">That crowd away before the driving wind ,</l>
     <l n="4">More ardent as the disk emerges more ,</l>
     <l n="5">Resemble most some city in a blaze ,</l>
     <l n="6">Seen through the leafless wood . His slanting ray</l>
     <l n="7">Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , tinging all with his own rosy hue ,</l>
     <l n="9">From every herb and every spiry blade</l>
     <l n="10">Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field .</l>
     <l n="11">Mine , spindling into longitude immense ,</l>
     <l n="12">In spite of gravity , and sage remark</l>
     <l n="13">That I myself am but a fleeting shade ,</l>
     <l n="14">Provokes me to a smile . With eye askance</l>
     <l n="15">I view the muscular proportion 'd limb</l>
     <l n="16">Transform 'd to a lean shank . The shapeless pair</l>
     <l n="17">As they design 'd to mock me , at my side</l>
     <l n="18">Take step for step ; and , as I near approach</l>
     <l n="19">The cottage , walk along the plaster 'd wall ,</l>
     <l n="20">Preposterous sight ! the legs without the man .</l>
     <l n="21">The verdure of the plain lies buried deep</l>
     <l n="22">Beneath the dazzling deluge ; and the bents</l>
     <l n="23">And coarser grass , upspearing o'er the rest ,</l>
     <l n="24">Of late unsightly and unseen , now shine</l>
     <l n="25">Conspicuous , and in bright apparel clad ,</l>
     <l n="26">And fledged with icy feathers , nod superb .</l>
     <l n="27">The cattle mourn in corners , where the fence</l>
     <l n="28">Screens them , and seem half petrified to sleep</l>
     <l n="29">In unrecumbent sadness . There they wait</l>
     <l n="30">Their wonted fodder ; not like hungering man ,</l>
     <l n="31">Fretful if unsupplied ; but silent , meek ,</l>
     <l n="32">And patient of the slow-paced swain 's delay .</l>
     <l n="33">He from the stack carves out the accustom 'd load ,</l>
     <l n="34">Deep plunging , and again deep plunging oft ,</l>
     <l n="35">His broad keen knife into the solid mass :</l>
     <l n="36">Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands ,</l>
     <l n="37">With such undeviating and even force</l>
     <l n="38">He severs it away : no needless care ,</l>
     <l n="39">Lest storms should overset the leaning pile</l>
     <l n="40">Deciduous , or its own unbalanced weight .</l>
     <l n="41">Forth goes the woodman , leaving unconcern 'd</l>
     <l n="42">The cheerful haunts of man ; to wield the axe</l>
     <l n="43">And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear ,</l>
     <l n="44">From morn to eve his solitary task .</l>
     <l n="45">Shaggy , and lean , and shrewd , with pointed ears</l>
     <l n="46">And tail cropp 'd short , half lurcher and half cur ,</l>
     <l n="47">His dog attends him . Close behind his heel</l>
     <l n="48">Now creeps he slow ; and now , with many a frisk</l>
     <l n="49">Wide scampering , snatches up the driften snow</l>
     <l n="50">With ivory teeth , or ploughs it with his snout ;</l>
     <l n="51">Then shakes his powder 'd coat , and barks for joy .</l>
     <l n="52">Heedless of all his pranks , the sturdy churl</l>
     <l n="53">Moves right toward the mark ; nor stops for aught ,</l>
     <l n="54">But now and then with pressure of his thumb</l>
     <l n="55">To adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube ,</l>
     <l n="56">That fumes beneath his nose : the trailing cloud</l>
     <l n="57">Streams far behind him , scenting all the air .</l>
     <l n="58">Now from the roost , or from the neighbouring pale ,</l>
     <l n="59">Where , diligent to catch the first fair gleam</l>
     <l n="60">Of smiling day , they gossip 'd side by side ,</l>
     <l n="61">Come trooping at the housewife 's well-known call</l>
     <l n="62">The feather 'd tribes domestic . Half on wing ,</l>
     <l n="63">And half on foot , they brush the fleecy flood ,</l>
     <l n="64">Conscious , and fearful of too deep a plunge .</l>
     <l n="65">The sparrows peep , and quit the sheltering eaves ,</l>
     <l n="66">To seize the fair occasion : well they eye</l>
     <l n="67">The scatter 'd grain , and thievishly resolved</l>
     <l n="68">To escape the impending famine , often scared</l>
     <l n="69">As oft return , a pert voracious kind .</l>
     <l n="70">Clean riddance quickly made , one only care</l>
     <l n="71">Remains to each , the search of sunny nook ,</l>
     <l n="72">Or shed impervious to the blast . Resign 'd</l>
     <l n="73">To sad necessity , the cock foregoes</l>
     <l n="74">His wonted strut ; and , wading at their head</l>
     <l n="75">With well-consider 'd steps , seems to resent</l>
     <l n="76">His alter 'd gait and stateliness retrench 'd .</l>
     <l n="77">How find the myriads , that in summer cheer</l>
     <l n="78">The hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs ,</l>
     <l n="79">Due sustenance , or where subsist they now ?</l>
     <l n="80">Earth yields them nought : the imprison 'd worm is safe</l>
     <l n="81">Beneath the frozen clod ; all seeds of herbs</l>
     <l n="82">Lie cover 'd close ; and berry-bearing thorns ,</l>
     <l n="83">That feed the thrush , ( whatever some suppose ,)</l>
     <l n="84">Afford the smaller minstrels no supply .</l>
     <l n="85">The long protracted rigour of the year</l>
     <l n="86">Thins all their numerous flocks . In chinks and holes</l>
     <l n="87">Ten thousand seek an unmolested end ,</l>
     <l n="88">As instinct prompts ; self-buried ere they die .</l>
     <l n="89">The very rooks and daws forsake the fields ,</l>
     <l n="90">Where neither grub , nor root , nor earth-nut , now</l>
     <l n="91">Repays their labour more ; and , perch 'd aloft</l>
     <l n="92">By the way-side , or stalking in the path ,</l>
     <l n="93">Lean pensioners upon the traveller 's track ,</l>
     <l n="94">Pick up their nauseous dole , though sweet to them ,</l>
     <l n="95">Of voided pulse or half-digested grain .</l>
     <l n="96">The streams are lost amid the splendid blank ,</l>
     <l n="97">O'erwhelming all distinction . On the flood ,</l>
     <l n="98">Indurated and fix 'd , the snowy weight</l>
     <l n="99">Lies undissolved ; while silently beneath ,</l>
     <l n="100">And unperceived , the current steals away .</l>
     <l n="101">Not so where , scornful of a check , it leaps</l>
     <l n="102">The mill-dam , dashes on the restless wheel ,</l>
     <l n="103">And wantons in the pebbly gulf below :</l>
     <l n="104">No frost can bind it there ; its utmost force</l>
     <l n="105">Can but arrest the light and smoky mist</l>
     <l n="106">That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide .</l>
     <l n="107">And see where it has hung the embroider 'd banks</l>
     <l n="108">With forms so various , that no powers of art ,</l>
     <l n="109">The pencil or the pen , may trace the scene !</l>
     <l n="110">Here glittering turrets rise , upbearing high</l>
     <l n="111">( Fantastic misarrangement ! ) on the roof</l>
     <l n="112">Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees</l>
     <l n="113">And shrubs of fairy land . The crystal drops</l>
     <l n="114">That trickle down the branches , fast congeal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="115">Shoot into pillars of pellucid length ,</l>
     <l n="116">And prop the pile they but adorn 'd before .</l>
     <l n="117">Here grotto within grotto safe defies</l>
     <l n="118">The sunbeam ; there , embossed and fretted wild ,</l>
     <l n="119">The growing wonder takes a thousand shapes</l>
     <l n="120">Capricious , in which fancy seeks in vain</l>
     <l n="121">The likeness of some object seen before .</l>
     <l n="122">Thus Nature works as if to mock at Art ,</l>
     <l n="123">And in defiance of her rival powers ;</l>
     <l n="124">By these fortuitous and random strokes</l>
     <l n="125">Performing such inimitable feats</l>
     <l n="126">As she with all her rules can never reach .</l>
     <l n="127">Less worthy of applause , though more admired ,</l>
     <l n="128">Because a novelty , the work of man ,</l>
     <l n="129">Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ !</l>
     <l n="130">Thy most magnificent and mighty freak ,</l>
     <l n="131">The wonder of the North . No forest fell</l>
     <l n="132">When thou wouldst build ; no quarry sent its stores</l>
     <l n="133">To enrich thy walls : but thou didst hew the floods ,</l>
     <l n="134">And make thy marble of the glassy wave .</l>
     <l n="135">In such a palace Aristæus found</l>
     <l n="136">Cyrene , when he bore the plaintive tale</l>
     <l n="137">Of his lost bees to her maternal ear :</l>
     <l n="138">In such a palace Poetry might place</l>
     <l n="139">The armoury of Winter ; where his troops ,</l>
     <l n="140">The gloomy clouds , find weapons , arrowy sleet ,</l>
     <l n="141">Skin-piercing volley , blossom-bruising hail ,</l>
     <l n="142">And snow , that often blinds the traveller 's course ,</l>
     <l n="143">And wraps him in an unexpected tomb .</l>
     <l n="144">Silently as a dream the fabric rose ;</l>
     <l n="145">No sound of hammer or of saw was there .</l>
     <l n="146">Ice upon ice , the well-adjusted parts</l>
     <l n="147">Were soon conjoin 'd ; nor other cement ask 'd</l>
     <l n="148">Than water interfused to make them one .</l>
     <l n="149">Lamps gracefully disposed , and of all hues ,</l>
     <l n="150">Illumined every side ; a watery light</l>
     <l n="151">Gleam 'd through the clear transparency , that seem 'd</l>
     <l n="152">Another moon new risen , or meteor fallen</l>
     <l n="153">From heaven to earth , of lambent flame serene .</l>
     <l n="154">So stood the brittle prodigy ; though smooth</l>
     <l n="155">And slippery the materials , yet frost-bound</l>
     <l n="156">Firm as a rock . Nor wanted aught within ,</l>
     <l n="157">That royal residence might well befit ,</l>
     <l n="158">For grandeur or for use . Long wavy wreaths</l>
     <l n="159">Of flowers , that fear 'd no enemy but warmth ,</l>
     <l n="160">Blush 'd on the panels . Mirror needed none</l>
     <l n="161">Where all was vitreous ; but in order due</l>
     <l n="162">Convivial table and commodious seat</l>
     <l n="163">( What seem 'd at least commodious seat ) were there ;</l>
     <l n="164">Sofa , and couch , and high-built throne august .</l>
     <l n="165">The same lubricity was found in all ,</l>
     <l n="166">And all was moist to the warm touch ; a scene</l>
     <l n="167">Of evanescent glory , once a stream ,</l>
     <l n="168">And soon to slide into a stream again .</l>
     <l n="169">Alas ! ‘ twas but a mortifying stroke</l>
     <l n="170">Of undesign 'd severity , that glanced</l>
     <l n="171">( Made by a monarch ) on her own estate ,</l>
     <l n="172">On human grandeur and the courts of kings .</l>
     <l n="173">‘ Twas transient in its nature , as in show</l>
     <l n="174">‘ Twas durable ; as worthless , as it seem 'd</l>
     <l n="175">Intrinsically precious ; to the foot</l>
     <l n="176">Treacherous and false ; it smiled , and it was cold .</l>
     <l n="177">Great princes have great playthings . Some have play 'd</l>
     <l n="178">At hewing mountains into men , and some</l>
     <l n="179">At building human wonders mountain high .</l>
     <l n="180">Some have amused the dull sad years of life</l>
     <l n="181">( Life spent in indolence , and therefore sad )</l>
     <l n="182">With schemes of monumental fame ; and sought</l>
     <l n="183">By pyramids and mausolean pomp ,</l>
     <l n="184">Short-lived themselves , to immortalize their bones .</l>
     <l n="185">Some seek diversion in the tented field ,</l>
     <l n="186">And make the sorrows of mankind their sport .</l>
     <l n="187">But war 's a game which , were their subjects wise ,</l>
     <l n="188">Kings would not play at . Nations would do well</l>
     <l n="189">To extort their truncheons from the puny hands</l>
     <l n="190">Of heroes , whose infirm and baby minds</l>
     <l n="191">Are gratified with mischief , and who spoil ,</l>
     <l n="192">Because men suffer it , their toy , the World .</l>
     <l n="193">When Babel was confounded , and the great</l>
     <l n="194">Confederacy of projectors wild and vain</l>
     <l n="195">Was split into diversity of tongues ,</l>
     <l n="196">Then , as a shepherd separates his flock ,</l>
     <l n="197">These to the upland , to the valley those ,</l>
     <l n="198">God drave asunder , and assign 'd their lot</l>
     <l n="199">To all the nations . Ample was the boon</l>
     <l n="200">He gave them , in its distribution fair</l>
     <l n="201">And equal ; and he bade them dwell in peace .</l>
     <l n="202">Peace was awhile their care : they plough 'd , and sow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="203">And reap 'd their plenty without grudge or strife ,</l>
     <l n="204">But violence can never longer sleep</l>
     <l n="205">Than human passions please . In every heart</l>
     <l n="206">Are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war ;</l>
     <l n="207">Occasion needs but fan them , and they blaze .</l>
     <l n="208">Cain had already shed a brother 's blood ;</l>
     <l n="209">The deluge wash 'd it out ; but left unquench 'd</l>
     <l n="210">The seeds of murder in the breast of man .</l>
     <l n="211">Soon by a righteous judgment in the line</l>
     <l n="212">Of his descending progeny was found</l>
     <l n="213">The first artificer of death ; the shrewd</l>
     <l n="214">Contriver , who first sweated at the forge ,</l>
     <l n="215">And forced the blunt and yet unbloodied steel</l>
     <l n="216">To a keen edge , and made it bright for war .</l>
     <l n="217">Him , Tubal named , the Vulcan of old times ,</l>
     <l n="218">The sword and falchion their inventor claim ;</l>
     <l n="219">And the first smith was the first murderer 's son .</l>
     <l n="220">His art survived the waters ; and ere long ,</l>
     <l n="221">When man was multiplied and spread abroad</l>
     <l n="222">In tribes and clans , and had begun to call</l>
     <l n="223">These meadows and that range of hills his own ,</l>
     <l n="224">The tasted sweets of property begat</l>
     <l n="225">Desire of more ; and industry in some ,</l>
     <l n="226">To improve and cultivate their just demesne ,</l>
     <l n="227">Made others covet what they saw so fair .</l>
     <l n="228">Thus war began on earth ; these fought for spoil ,</l>
     <l n="229">And those in self-defence . Savage at first</l>
     <l n="230">The onset , and irregular . At length</l>
     <l n="231">One eminent above the rest for strength ,</l>
     <l n="232">For stratagem , or courage , or for all ,</l>
     <l n="233">Was chosen leader ; him they served in war ,</l>
     <l n="234">And him in peace , for sake of warlike deeds ,</l>
     <l n="235">Reverenced no less . Who could with him compare ?</l>
     <l n="236">Or who so worthy to control themselves ,</l>
     <l n="237">As he , whose prowess had subdued their foes ?</l>
     <l n="238">Thus war , affording field for the display</l>
     <l n="239">Of virtue , made one chief , whom times of peace ,</l>
     <l n="240">Which have their exigencies too , and call</l>
     <l n="241">For skill in government , at length made king .</l>
     <l n="242">King was a name too proud for man to wear</l>
     <l n="243">With modesty and meekness ; and the crown ,</l>
     <l n="244">So dazzling in their eyes who set it on ,</l>
     <l n="245">Was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound .</l>
     <l n="246">It is the abject property of most ,</l>
     <l n="247">That , being parcel of the common mass ,</l>
     <l n="248">And destitute of means to raise themselves ,</l>
     <l n="249">They sink , and settle lower than they need .</l>
     <l n="250">They know not what it is to feel within</l>
     <l n="251">A comprehensive faculty , that grasps</l>
     <l n="252">Great purposes with ease , that turns and wields ,</l>
     <l n="253">Almost without an effort , plans too vast</l>
     <l n="254">For their conception , which they cannot move .</l>
     <l n="255">Conscious of impotence , they soon grow drunk</l>
     <l n="256">With gazing , when they see an able man</l>
     <l n="257">Step forth to notice ; and , besotted thus ,</l>
     <l n="258">Build him a pedestal , and say , “ Stand there ,</l>
     <l n="259">And be our admiration and our praise . ”</l>
     <l n="260">They roll themselves before him in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="261">Then most deserving in their own account</l>
     <l n="262">When most extravagant in his applause ,</l>
     <l n="263">As if exalting him they raised themselves .</l>
     <l n="264">Thus by degrees , self-cheated of their sound</l>
     <l n="265">And sober judgment , that he is but man ,</l>
     <l n="266">They demi-deify and fume him so ,</l>
     <l n="267">That in due season he forgets it too .</l>
     <l n="268">Inflated and astrut with self-conceit ,</l>
     <l n="269">He gulps the windy diet ; and , ere long ,</l>
     <l n="270">Adopting their mistake , profoundly thinks</l>
     <l n="271">The world was made in vain , if not for him .</l>
     <l n="272">Thenceforth they are his cattle : drudges , born</l>
     <l n="273">To bear his burdens , drawing in his gears ,</l>
     <l n="274">And sweating in his service , his caprice</l>
     <l n="275">Becomes the soul that animates them all .</l>
     <l n="276">He deems a thousand , or ten thousand lives ,</l>
     <l n="277">Spent in the purchase of renown for him ,</l>
     <l n="278">An easy reckoning ; and they think the same .</l>
     <l n="279">Thus kings were first invented , and thus kings</l>
     <l n="280">Were burnish 'd into heroes , and became</l>
     <l n="281">The arbiters of this terraqueous swamp ;</l>
     <l n="282">Storks among frogs , that have but croak 'd and died .</l>
     <l n="283">Strange , that such folly , as lifts bloated man</l>
     <l n="284">To eminence , fit only for a god ,</l>
     <l n="285">Should ever drivel out of human lips ,</l>
     <l n="286">E'en in the cradled weakness of the world !</l>
     <l n="287">Still stranger much , that , when at length mankind</l>
     <l n="288">Had reach 'd the sinewy firmness of their youth ,</l>
     <l n="289">And could discriminate and argue well</l>
     <l n="290">On subjects more mysterious , they were yet</l>
     <l n="291">Babes in the cause of freedom , and should fear</l>
     <l n="292">And quake before the gods themselves had made .</l>
     <l n="293">But above measure strange , that neither proof</l>
     <l n="294">Of sad experience , nor examples set</l>
     <l n="295">By some , whose patriot virtue has prevail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="296">Can even now , when they are grown mature</l>
     <l n="297">In wisdom , and with philosophic deeds</l>
     <l n="298">Familiar , serve to emancipate the rest !</l>
     <l n="299">Such dupes are men to custom , and so prone</l>
     <l n="300">To reverence what is ancient , and can plead</l>
     <l n="301">A course of long observance for its use ,</l>
     <l n="302">That even servitude , the worst of ills ,</l>
     <l n="303">Because deliver 'd down from sire to son ,</l>
     <l n="304">Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing !</l>
     <l n="305">But is it fit , or can it bear the shock</l>
     <l n="306">Of rational discussion , that a man ,</l>
     <l n="307">Compounded and made up like other men</l>
     <l n="308">Of elements tumultuous , in whom lust</l>
     <l n="309">And folly in as ample measure meet ,</l>
     <l n="310">As in the bosoms of the slaves he rules ,</l>
     <l n="311">Should be a despot absolute , and boast</l>
     <l n="312">Himself the only freeman of his land ?</l>
     <l n="313">Should , when he pleases , and on whom he will ,</l>
     <l n="314">Wage war , with any or with no pretence</l>
     <l n="315">Of provocation given , or wrong sustain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="316">And force the beggarly last doit , by means</l>
     <l n="317">That his own humour dictates , from the clutch</l>
     <l n="318">Of poverty , that thus he may procure</l>
     <l n="319">His thousands , weary of penurious life ,</l>
     <l n="320">A splendid opportunity to die ?</l>
     <l n="321">Say ye , who ( with less prudence than of old</l>
     <l n="322">Jotham ascribed to his assembled trees</l>
     <l n="323">In politic convention ) put your trust</l>
     <l n="324">In the shadow of a bramble , and , reclined</l>
     <l n="325">In fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch ,</l>
     <l n="326">Rejoice in him , and celebrate his sway ,</l>
     <l n="327">Where find ye passive fortitude ? Whence springs</l>
     <l n="328">Your self-denying zeal , that holds it good</l>
     <l n="329">To stroke the prickly grievance , and to hang</l>
     <l n="330">His thorns with streamers of continual praise ?</l>
     <l n="331">We too are friends to loyalty . We love</l>
     <l n="332">The king who loves the law , respects his bounds ,</l>
     <l n="333">And reigns content within them : him we serve</l>
     <l n="334">Freely and with delight , who leaves us free :</l>
     <l n="335">But , recollecting still that he is man ,</l>
     <l n="336">We trust him not too far . King though he be ,</l>
     <l n="337">And king in England too , he may be weak ,</l>
     <l n="338">And vain enough to be ambitious still ;</l>
     <l n="339">May exercise amiss his proper powers ,</l>
     <l n="340">Or covet more than freemen choose to grant :</l>
     <l n="341">Beyond that mark is treason . He is ours ,</l>
     <l n="342">To administer , to guard , to adorn the state ,</l>
     <l n="343">But not to warp or change it . We are his ,</l>
     <l n="344">To serve him nobly in the common cause ,</l>
     <l n="345">True to the death , but not to be his slaves .</l>
     <l n="346">Mark now the difference , ye that boast your love</l>
     <l n="347">Of kings , between your loyalty and ours .</l>
     <l n="348">We love the man , the paltry pageant you :</l>
     <l n="349">We the chief patron of the commonwealth ,</l>
     <l n="350">You the regardless author of its woes :</l>
     <l n="351">We for the sake of liberty a king ,</l>
     <l n="352">You chains and bondage for a tyrant 's sake .</l>
     <l n="353">Our love is principle , and has its root</l>
     <l n="354">In reason , is judicious , manly , free ;</l>
     <l n="355">Yours , a blind instinct , crouches to the rod ,</l>

     <l n="499">Of liberty , themselves the slaves of lust ,</l>
     <l n="500">Incurs derision for his easy faith</l>

     <l n="503">Where private was not ? Can he love the whole</l>
     <l n="504">Who loves no part ? He be a nation 's friend</l>
     <l n="505">Who is , in truth , the friend of no man there ?</l>
     <l n="506">Can he be strenuous in his country 's cause</l>
     <l n="507">Who slights the charities for whose dear sake</l>
     <l n="508">That country , if at all , must be beloved ?</l>
     <l n="509">‘ Tis therefore sober and good men are sad</l>

     <l n="512">So loose to private duty , that no brain ,</l>
     <l n="513">Healthful and undisturb 'd by factious fumes ,</l>

     <l n="521">Shone brighter still , once call 'd to public view ,</l>

     <l n="525">And , seeing the old castle of the state ,</l>

     <l n="533">Time ploughs them up , and not a trace remains .</l>
     <l n="534">We build with what we deem eternal rock :</l>
     <l n="535">A distant age asks where the fabric stood ;</l>
     <l n="536">And in the dust , sifted and search 'd in vain ,</l>
     <l n="537">The undiscoverable secret sleeps .</l>
     <l n="538">But there is yet a liberty , unsung</l>
     <l n="539">By poets , and by senators unpraised ,</l>
     <l n="540">Which monarchs cannot grant , nor all the powers</l>
     <l n="541">Of earth and hell confederate take away :</l>
     <l n="542">A liberty which persecution , fraud ,</l>
     <l n="543">Oppression , prisons , have no power to bind :</l>
     <l n="544">Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more .</l>
     <l n="545">‘ Tis liberty of heart , derived from Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="546">Bought with His blood who gave it to mankind ,</l>
     <l n="547">And seal 'd with the same token . It is held</l>
     <l n="548">By charter , and that charter sanction 'd sure</l>
     <l n="549">By the unimpeachable and awful oath</l>
     <l n="550">And promise of a God . His other gifts</l>
     <l n="551">All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his ,</l>
     <l n="552">And are august ; but this transcends them all .</l>
     <l n="553">His other works , the visible display</l>
     <l n="554">Of all-creating energy and might ,</l>
     <l n="555">Are grand , no doubt , and worthy of the word</l>
     <l n="556">That , finding an interminable space</l>
     <l n="557">Unoccupied , has fill 'd the void so well ,</l>
     <l n="558">And made so sparkling what was dark before .</l>
     <l n="559">But these are not his glory . Man , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="560">Smit with the beauty of so fair a scene ,</l>
     <l n="561">Might well suppose the Artificer divine</l>
     <l n="562">Meant it eternal , had he not himself</l>
     <l n="563">Pronounced it transient , glorious as it is ,</l>
     <l n="564">And , still designing a more glorious far ,</l>
     <l n="565">Doom 'd it as insufficient for his praise .</l>
     <l n="566">These , therefore , are occasional , and pass ;</l>
     <l n="567">Form 'd for the confutation of the fool ,</l>
     <l n="568">Whose lying heart disputes against a God ;</l>
     <l n="569">That office served , they must be swept away .</l>
     <l n="570">Not so the labours of his love : they shine</l>
     <l n="571">In other heavens than these that we behold ,</l>
     <l n="572">And fade not . There is paradise that fears</l>
     <l n="573">No forfeiture , and of its fruits he sends</l>
     <l n="574">Large prelibation oft to saints below .</l>
     <l n="575">Of these the first in order , and the pledge</l>
     <l n="576">And confident assurance of the rest ,</l>
     <l n="577">Is liberty : a flight into his arms ,</l>
     <l n="578">Ere yet mortality 's fine threads give way ,</l>
     <l n="579">A clear escape from tyrannizing lust ,</l>
     <l n="580">And full immunity from penal woe .</l>
     <l n="581">Chains are the portion of revolted man ,</l>
     <l n="582">Stripes , and a dungeon ; and his body serves</l>
     <l n="583">The triple purpose . In that sickly , foul ,</l>
     <l n="584">Opprobrious residence he finds them all .</l>
     <l n="585">Propense his heart to idols , he is held</l>
     <l n="586">In silly dotage on created things ,</l>
     <l n="587">Careless of their Creator . And that low</l>
     <l n="588">And sordid gravitation of his powers</l>
     <l n="589">To a vile clod so draws him , with such force</l>
     <l n="590">Resistless from the centre he should seek ,</l>
     <l n="591">That he at last forgets it . All his hopes</l>
     <l n="592">Tend downward ; his ambition is to sink ,</l>
     <l n="593">To reach a depth profounder still , and still</l>
     <l n="594">Profounder , in the fathomless abyss</l>
     <l n="595">Of folly , plunging in pursuit of death .</l>
     <l n="596">But , ere he gain the comfortless repose</l>
     <l n="597">He seeks , and acquiescence of his soul ,</l>
     <l n="598">In heaven-renouncing exile , he endures —</l>
     <l n="599">What does he not , from lusts opposed in vain ,</l>
     <l n="600">And self-reproaching conscience ? He foresees</l>
     <l n="601">The fatal issue to his health , fame , peace ,</l>
     <l n="602">Fortune and dignity ; the loss of all</l>
     <l n="603">That can ennoble man , and make frail life ,</l>
     <l n="604">Short as it is , supportable . Still worse ,</l>
     <l n="605">Far worse than all the plagues , with which his sins</l>
     <l n="606">Infect his happiest moments , he forebodes</l>
     <l n="607">Ages of hopeless misery . Future death ,</l>
     <l n="608">And death still future . Not a hasty stroke ,</l>
     <l n="609">Like that which sends him to the dusty grave ;</l>
     <l n="610">But unrepealable enduring death .</l>
     <l n="611">Scripture is still a trumpet to his fears :</l>

     <l n="613">What none but bad men wish exploded must .</l>
     <l n="614">That scruple checks him . Riot is not loud</l>
     <l n="615">Nor drunk enough to drown it . In the midst</l>

     <l n="617">And he abhors the jest by which he shines .</l>
     <l n="618">Remorse begets reform . His master-lust</l>

     <l n="665">Of lust , and on the anvil of despair ,</l>
     <l n="666">He slights the strokes of conscience . Nothing moves</l>
     <l n="667">Or nothing much , his constancy in ill ;</l>
     <l n="668">Vain tampering has but foster 'd his disease ;</l>

     <l n="704">Patriots have toil 'd , and in their country 's cause</l>

     <l n="713">To those who , posted at the shrine of Truth ,</l>
     <l n="714">Have fallen in her defence . A patriot 's blood ,</l>

     <l n="721">Our claim to feed upon immortal truth ,</l>
     <l n="722">To walk with God , to be divinely free ,</l>
     <l n="723">To soar , and to anticipate the skies .</l>

    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Bells at a distance — Their effect — A fine noon in winter — A sheltered walk — Meditation better than books — Our familiarity with the course of nature makes it appear less wonderful than it is — The transformation that spring effects in a shrubbery described — A mistake concerning the course of nature corrected — God maintains it by an unremitted act — The amusements fashionable at this hour of the day reproved — Animals happy , a delightful sight — Origin of cruelty to animals — That it is a great crime proved from scripture — That proof illustrated by a tale — A line drawn between the lawful and unlawful destruction of them — Their good and useful properties insisted on — Apology for the encomiums bestowed by the author on animals — Instances of man 's extravagant praise of man — The groans of the creation shall have an end — A view taken of the restoration of all things — An invocation and an invitation of Him who shall bring it to pass — The retired man vindicated from the charge of uselessness — Conclusion .</head>

     <l n="1">There is in souls a sympathy with sounds ;</l>
     <l n="2">And as the mind is pitch 'd the ear is pleased</l>
     <l n="3">With melting airs , or martial , brisk , or grave :</l>
     <l n="4">Some chord in unison with what we hear</l>
     <l n="5">Is touch 'd within us , and the heart replies .</l>
     <l n="6">How soft the music of those village bells ,</l>
     <l n="7">Falling at intervals upon the ear</l>
     <l n="8">In cadence sweet , now dying all away ,</l>
     <l n="9">Now pealing loud again , and louder still ,</l>
     <l n="10">Clear and sonorous , as the gale comes on !</l>
     <l n="11">With easy force it opens all the cells</l>
     <l n="12">Where Memory slept . Wherever I have heard</l>
     <l n="13">A kindred melody , the scene recurs ,</l>
     <l n="14">And with it all its pleasures and its pains .</l>
     <l n="15">Such comprehensive views the spirit takes ,</l>
     <l n="16">That in a few short moments I retrace</l>
     <l n="17">( As in a map the voyager his course )</l>

     <l n="19">Short as in retrospect the journey seems ,</l>

     <l n="21">And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="22">Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length .</l>
     <l n="23">Yet , feeling present evils , while the past</l>
     <l n="24">Faintly impress the mind , or not at all ,</l>
     <l n="25">How readily we wish time spent revoked ,</l>
     <l n="26">That we might try the ground again , where once</l>
     <l n="27">( Through inexperience , as we now perceive )</l>
     <l n="28">We miss 'd that happiness we might have found !</l>
     <l n="29">Some friend is gone , perhaps his son 's best friend ,</l>
     <l n="30">A father , whose authority , in show</l>
     <l n="31">When most severe , and mustering all its force ,</l>
     <l n="32">Was but the graver countenance of love :</l>
     <l n="33">Whose favour , like the clouds of spring , might lower ,</l>
     <l n="34">And utter now and then an awful voice ,</l>
     <l n="35">But had a blessing in its darkest frown ,</l>
     <l n="36">Threatening at once and nourishing the plant .</l>
     <l n="37">We loved , but not enough , the gentle hand</l>
     <l n="38">That rear 'd us . At a thoughtless age , allured</l>
     <l n="39">By every gilded folly , we renounced</l>
     <l n="40">His sheltering side , and wilfully forewent</l>
     <l n="41">That converse , which we now in vain regret ,</l>
     <l n="42">How gladly would the man recall to life</l>
     <l n="43">The boy 's neglected sire ! a mother too ,</l>
     <l n="44">That softer friend , perhaps more gladly still ,</l>
     <l n="45">Might he demand them at the gates of death .</l>
     <l n="46">Sorrow has , since they went , subdued and tamed</l>
     <l n="47">The playful humour ; he could now endure</l>
     <l n="48">( Himself grown sober in the vale of tears )</l>
     <l n="49">And feel a parent 's presence no restraint .</l>
     <l n="50">But not to understand a treasure 's worth</l>
     <l n="51">Till time has stolen away the slighted good ,</l>
     <l n="52">Is cause of half the poverty we feel ,</l>
     <l n="53">And makes the world the wilderness it is .</l>
     <l n="54">The few that pray at all pray oft amiss ,</l>
     <l n="55">And , seeking grace to improve the prize they hold ,</l>
     <l n="56">Would urge a wiser suit than asking more .</l>
     <l n="57">The night was winter in his roughest mood ;</l>
     <l n="58">The morning sharp and clear . But now at noon</l>
     <l n="59">Upon the southern side of the slant hills ,</l>
     <l n="60">And where the woods fence off the northern blast ,</l>
     <l n="61">The season smiles , resigning all its rage ,</l>
     <l n="62">And has the warmth of May . The vault is blue</l>
     <l n="63">Without a cloud , and white without a speck</l>
     <l n="64">The dazzling splendour of the scene below .</l>
     <l n="65">Again the harmony comes o'er the vale ;</l>
     <l n="66">And through the trees I view the embattled tower</l>
     <l n="67">Whence all the music . I again perceive</l>
     <l n="68">The soothing influence of the wafted strains ,</l>
     <l n="69">And settle in soft musings as I tread</l>
     <l n="70">The walk , still verdant , under oaks and elms ,</l>
     <l n="71">Whose outspread branches overarch the glade .</l>
     <l n="72">The roof , though moveable through all its length</l>
     <l n="73">As the wind sways it , has yet well sufficed ,</l>
     <l n="74">And , intercepting in their silent fall</l>
     <l n="75">The frequent flakes , has kept a path for me .</l>
     <l n="76">No noise is here , or none that hinders thought .</l>
     <l n="77">The redbreast warbles still , but is content</l>
     <l n="78">With slender notes , and more than half suppress 'd :</l>
     <l n="79">Pleased with his solitude , and flitting light</l>
     <l n="80">From spray to spray , where'er he rests he shakes</l>
     <l n="81">From many a twig the pendent drops of ice ,</l>
     <l n="82">That tinkle in the wither 'd leaves below .</l>
     <l n="83">Stillness , accompanied with sounds so soft ,</l>
     <l n="84">Charms more than silence . Meditation here</l>
     <l n="85">May think down hours to moments . Here the heart</l>
     <l n="86">May give a useful lesson to the head ,</l>
     <l n="87">And Learning wiser grow without his books .</l>
     <l n="88">Knowledge and Wisdom , far from being one ,</l>
     <l n="89">Have ofttimes no connexion . Knowledge dwells</l>
     <l n="90">In heads replete with thoughts of other men ;</l>
     <l n="91">Wisdom in minds attentive to their own .</l>
     <l n="92">Knowledge , a rude unprofitable mass ,</l>
     <l n="93">The mere materials with which Wisdom builds ,</l>
     <l n="94">Till smooth 'd , and squared , and fitted to its place ,</l>
     <l n="95">Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich .</l>
     <l n="96">Knowledge is proud that he has learn 'd so much ;</l>
     <l n="97">Wisdom is humble that he knows no more .</l>
     <l n="98">Books are not seldom talismans and spells ,</l>
     <l n="99">By which the magic art of shrewder wits</l>
     <l n="100">Holds an unthinking multitude enthrall 'd .</l>
     <l n="101">Some to the fascination of a name</l>
     <l n="102">Surrender judgment hoodwink 'd . Some the style</l>
     <l n="103">Infatuates , and through labyrinth and wilds</l>
     <l n="104">Of error leads them , by a tune entranced .</l>
     <l n="105">While sloth seduces more , too weak to bear</l>
     <l n="106">The insupportable fatigue of thought ,</l>
     <l n="107">And swallowing therefore without pause or choice</l>
     <l n="108">The total grist unsifted , husks and all .</l>
     <l n="109">But trees , and rivulets whose rapid course</l>
     <l n="110">Defies the check of winter , haunts of deer ,</l>
     <l n="111">And sheepwalks populous with bleating lambs ,</l>
     <l n="112">And lanes , in which the primrose ere her time</l>
     <l n="113">Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root ,</l>
     <l n="114">Deceive no student . Wisdom there , and truth ,</l>
     <l n="115">Not shy , as in the world , and to be won</l>
     <l n="116">By slow solicitation , seize at once</l>
     <l n="117">The roving thought , and fix it on themselves .</l>
     <l n="118">What prodigies can power divine perform</l>
     <l n="119">More grand than it produces year by year ,</l>
     <l n="120">And all in sight of inattentive man ?</l>
     <l n="121">Familiar with the effect , we slight the cause ,</l>
     <l n="122">And , in the constancy of nature 's course ,</l>
     <l n="123">The regular return of genial months ,</l>
     <l n="124">And renovation of a faded world ,</l>
     <l n="125">See nought to wonder at . Should God again ,</l>
     <l n="126">As once in Gibeon , interrupt the race</l>
     <l n="127">Of the undeviating and punctual sun ,</l>
     <l n="128">How would the world admire ! but speaks it less</l>
     <l n="129">An agency divine , to make him know</l>
     <l n="130">His moment when to sink and when to rise ,</l>
     <l n="131">Age after age , than to arrest his course ?</l>
     <l n="132">All we behold is miracle ; but , seen</l>
     <l n="133">So duly , all is miracle in vain .</l>
     <l n="134">Where now the vital energy that moved ,</l>
     <l n="135">While summer was , the pure and subtle lymph</l>
     <l n="136">Through the imperceptible meandering veins</l>
     <l n="137">Of leaf and flower ? It sleeps ; and the icy touch</l>
     <l n="138">Of unprolific winter has impress 'd</l>
     <l n="139">A cold stagnation on the intestine tide .</l>
     <l n="140">But let the months go round , a few short months ,</l>
     <l n="141">And all shall be restored . These naked shoots ,</l>
     <l n="142">Barren as lances , among which the wind</l>
     <l n="143">Makes wintry music , sighing as it goes ,</l>
     <l n="144">Shall put their graceful foliage on again ,</l>
     <l n="145">And , more aspiring , and with ampler spread ,</l>
     <l n="146">Shall boast new charms , and more than they have lost .</l>
     <l n="147">Then each , in its peculiar honours clad ,</l>
     <l n="148">Shall publish , even to the distant eye ,</l>
     <l n="149">Its family and tribe . Laburnum , rich</l>
     <l n="150">In streaming gold ; syringa , ivory pure ;</l>
     <l n="151">The scentless and the scented rose ; this red ,</l>
     <l n="152">And of an humbler growth , the other<span type="note_anchor">[ 816 ]</span>tall ,</l>
     <l n="153">And throwing up into the darkest gloom</l>
     <l n="154">Of neighbouring cypress , or more sable yew ,</l>
     <l n="155">Her silver globes , light as the foamy surf</l>
     <l n="156">That the wind severs from the broken wave ;</l>
     <l n="157">The lilac , various in array , now white ,</l>
     <l n="158">Now sanguine , and her beauteous head now set</l>
     <l n="159">With purple spikes pyramidal , as if ,</l>
     <l n="160">Studious of ornament , yet unresolved</l>
     <l n="161">Which hue she most approved , she chose them all :</l>
     <l n="162">Copious of flowers the woodbine , pale and wan ,</l>
     <l n="163">But well compensating her sickly looks</l>
     <l n="164">With never-cloying odours , early and late ;</l>
     <l n="165">Hypericum all bloom , so thick a swarm</l>
     <l n="166">Of flowers , like flies clothing her slender rods ,</l>
     <l n="167">That scarce a leaf appears ; mezereon too ,</l>
     <l n="168">Though leafless , well attired , and thick beset</l>
     <l n="169">With blushing wreaths , investing every spray ;</l>
     <l n="170">Althæa with the purple eye ; the broom ,</l>
     <l n="171">Yellow and bright , as bullion unalloy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="172">Her blossoms ; and luxuriant above all</l>
     <l n="173">The jasmine , throwing wide her elegant sweets ,</l>
     <l n="174">The deep dark green of whose unvarnish 'd leaf</l>
     <l n="175">Makes more conspicuous , and illumines more</l>
     <l n="176">The bright profusion of her scatter 'd stars .—</l>
     <l n="177">These have been , and these shall be in their day ;</l>
     <l n="178">And all this uniform , uncolour 'd scene</l>
     <l n="179">Shall be dismantled of its fleecy load ,</l>
     <l n="180">And flush into variety again .</l>
     <l n="181">From dearth to plenty , and from death to life ,</l>
     <l n="182">Is Nature 's progress , when she lectures man</l>
     <l n="183">In heavenly truth ; evincing , as she makes</l>
     <l n="184">The grand transition , that there lives and works</l>
     <l n="185">A soul in all things , and that soul is God .</l>
     <l n="186">The beauties of the wilderness are his ,</l>
     <l n="187">That make so gay the solitary place ,</l>
     <l n="188">Where no eye sees them . And the fairer forms ,</l>
     <l n="189">That cultivation glories in , are his .</l>
     <l n="190">He sets the bright procession on its way ,</l>
     <l n="191">And marshals all the order of the year ;</l>
     <l n="192">He marks the bounds which Winter may not pass ,</l>
     <l n="193">And blunts his pointed fury ; in its case ,</l>
     <l n="194">Russet and rude , folds up the tender germ ,</l>
     <l n="195">Uninjured , with inimitable art ;</l>
     <l n="196">And , ere one flowery season fades and dies ,</l>
     <l n="197">Designs the blooming wonders of the next .</l>
     <l n="198">Some say that , in the origin of things ,</l>
     <l n="199">When all creation started into birth ,</l>
     <l n="200">The infant elements received a law ,</l>
     <l n="201">From which they swerve not since ; that under force</l>
     <l n="202">Of that controlling ordinance they move ,</l>
     <l n="203">And need not his immediate hand , who first</l>
     <l n="204">Prescribed their course , to regulate it now .</l>
     <l n="205">Thus dream they , and contrive to save a God</l>
     <l n="206">The incumbrance of his own concerns , and spare</l>
     <l n="207">The great Artificer of all that moves</l>
     <l n="208">The stress of a continual act , the pain</l>
     <l n="209">Of unremitted vigilance and care ,</l>
     <l n="210">As too laborious and severe a task .</l>
     <l n="211">So man , the moth , is not afraid , it seems ,</l>
     <l n="212">To span omnipotence , and measure might ,</l>
     <l n="213">That knows no measure , by the scanty rule</l>
     <l n="214">And standard of his own , that is to-day ,</l>
     <l n="215">And is not ere to-morrow 's sun go down .</l>
     <l n="216">But how should matter occupy a charge ,</l>
     <l n="217">Dull as it is , and satisfy a law</l>
     <l n="218">So vast in its demands , unless impell 'd</l>
     <l n="219">To ceaseless service by a ceaseless force ,</l>
     <l n="220">And under pressure of some conscious cause ?</l>
     <l n="221">The Lord of all , himself through all diffused ,</l>
     <l n="222">Sustains and is the life of all that lives .</l>
     <l n="223">Nature is but a name for an effect ,</l>
     <l n="224">Whose cause is God . He feeds the secret fire ,</l>
     <l n="225">By which the mighty process is maintain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="226">Who sleeps not , is not weary ; in whose sight</l>
     <l n="227">Slow circling ages are as transient days ;</l>
     <l n="228">Whose work is without labour ; whose designs</l>
     <l n="229">No flaw deforms , no difficulty thwarts ;</l>
     <l n="230">And whose beneficence no charge exhausts .</l>
     <l n="231">Him blind antiquity profaned , not served ,</l>
     <l n="232">With self-taught rites , and under various names ,</l>
     <l n="233">Female and male , Pomona , Pales , Pan ,</l>
     <l n="234">And Flora , and Vertumnus ; peopling earth</l>
     <l n="235">With tutelary goddesses and gods</l>
     <l n="236">That were not ; and commending as they would</l>
     <l n="237">To each some province , garden , field , or grove .</l>
     <l n="238">But all are under one . One spirit , His</l>
     <l n="239">Who wore the platted thorns with bleeding brows ,</l>
     <l n="240">Rules universal nature . Not a flower</l>
     <l n="241">But shows some touch , in freckle , streak , or stain ,</l>
     <l n="242">Of his unrivall 'd pencil . He inspires</l>
     <l n="243">Their balmy odours , and imparts their hues ,</l>
     <l n="244">And bathes their eyes with nectar , and includes ,</l>
     <l n="245">In grains as countless as the seaside sands ,</l>
     <l n="246">The forms with which he sprinkles all the earth .</l>
     <l n="247">Happy who walks with him ! whom what he finds</l>
     <l n="248">Of flavour or of scent in fruit or flower ,</l>
     <l n="249">Or what he views of beautiful or grand</l>
     <l n="250">In nature , from the broad majestic oak</l>
     <l n="251">To the green blade that twinkles in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="252">Prompts with remembrance of a present God .</l>
     <l n="253">His presence , who made all so fair , perceived</l>
     <l n="254">Makes all still fairer . As with him no scene</l>
     <l n="255">Is dreary , so with him all seasons please .</l>
     <l n="256">Though winter had been none , had man been true ,</l>
     <l n="257">And earth be punish 'd for its tenant 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="258">Yet not in vengeance ; as this smiling sky ,</l>
     <l n="259">So soon succeeding such an angry night ,</l>
     <l n="260">And these dissolving snows , and this clear stream</l>
     <l n="261">Recovering fast its liquid music , prove .</l>
     <l n="262">Who then , that has a mind well strung and tuned</l>
     <l n="263">To contemplation , and within his reach</l>
     <l n="264">A scene so friendly to his favourite task ,</l>
     <l n="265">Would waste attention at the chequer 'd board ,</l>
     <l n="266">His host of wooden warriors to and fro</l>
     <l n="267">Marching and countermarching , with an eye</l>
     <l n="268">As fix 'd as marble , with a forehead ridged</l>
     <l n="269">And furrow 'd into storms , and with a hand</l>
     <l n="270">Trembling , as if eternity were hung</l>
     <l n="271">In balance on his conduct of a pin ?</l>
     <l n="272">Nor envies he aught more their idle sport ,</l>
     <l n="273">Who pant with application misapplied</l>
     <l n="274">To trivial joys , and pushing ivory balls ,</l>
     <l n="275">Across a velvet level , feel a joy</l>
     <l n="276">Akin to rapture , when the bauble finds</l>
     <l n="277">Its destined goal of difficult access .</l>
     <l n="278">Nor deems he wiser him , who gives his noon</l>
     <l n="279">To miss , the mercer 's plague , from shop to shop</l>
     <l n="280">Wandering , and littering with unfolded silks</l>
     <l n="281">The polish 'd counter , and approving none ,</l>
     <l n="282">Or promising with smiles to call again .</l>
     <l n="283">Nor him who , by his vanity seduced ,</l>
     <l n="284">And soothed into a dream that he discerns</l>
     <l n="285">The difference of a Guido from a daub ,</l>
     <l n="286">Frequents the crowded auction : station 'd there</l>
     <l n="287">As duly as the Langford of the show ,</l>
     <l n="288">With glass at eye , and catalogue in hand ,</l>
     <l n="289">And tongue accomplish 'd in the fulsome cant</l>
     <l n="290">And pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease :</l>
     <l n="291">Oft as the price-deciding hammer falls ,</l>
     <l n="292">He notes it in his book , then raps his box ,</l>
     <l n="293">Swears ‘ tis a bargain , rails at his hard fate</l>
     <l n="294">That he has let it pass — but never bids .</l>
     <l n="295">Here unmolested , through whatever sign</l>
     <l n="296">The sun proceeds , I wander . Neither mist ,</l>
     <l n="297">Nor freezing sky nor sultry , checking me ,</l>
     <l n="298">Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy .</l>
     <l n="299">E'en in the spring and playtime of the year ,</l>
     <l n="300">That calls the unwonted villager abroad</l>
     <l n="301">With all her little ones , a sportive train ,</l>
     <l n="302">To gather kingcups in the yellow mead ,</l>
     <l n="303">And prink their hair with daisies , or to pick</l>
     <l n="304">A cheap but wholesome salad from the brook ,</l>
     <l n="305">These shades are all my own . The timorous hare ,</l>
     <l n="306">Grown so familiar with her frequent guest ,</l>
     <l n="307">Scarce shuns me ; and the stockdove unalarm 'd</l>
     <l n="308">Sits cooing in the pine-tree , nor suspends</l>
     <l n="309">His long love-ditty for my near approach .</l>
     <l n="310">Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm ,</l>
     <l n="311">That age or injury has hollow 'd deep ,</l>
     <l n="312">Where , on his bed of wool and matted leaves ,</l>
     <l n="313">He has outslept the winter , ventures forth</l>
     <l n="314">To frisk awhile , and bask in the warm sun ,</l>
     <l n="315">The squirrel , flippant , pert , and full of play :</l>
     <l n="316">He sees me , and at once , swift as a bird ,</l>
     <l n="317">Ascends the neighbouring beech ; there whisks his brush ,</l>
     <l n="318">And perks his ears , and stamps , and cries aloud ,</l>
     <l n="319">With all the prettiness of feign 'd alarm ,</l>
     <l n="320">And anger insignificantly fierce .</l>
     <l n="321">The heart is hard in nature , and unfit</l>
     <l n="322">For human fellowship , as being void</l>
     <l n="323">Of sympathy , and therefore dead alike</l>
     <l n="324">To love and friendship both , that is not pleased</l>
     <l n="325">With sight of animals enjoying life ,</l>
     <l n="326">Nor feels their happiness augment his own .</l>
     <l n="327">The bounding fawn , that darts across the glade</l>
     <l n="328">When none pursues , through mere delight of heart ,</l>
     <l n="329">And spirits buoyant with excess of glee ;</l>
     <l n="330">The horse as wanton , and almost as fleet ,</l>
     <l n="331">That skims the spacious meadow at full speed ,</l>
     <l n="332">Then stops and snorts , and , throwing high his heels ,</l>
     <l n="333">Starts to the voluntary race again ;</l>
     <l n="334">The very kine that gambol at high noon ,</l>
     <l n="335">The total herd receiving first from one</l>
     <l n="336">That leads the dance a summons to be gay ,</l>
     <l n="337">Though wild their strange vagaries , and uncouth</l>
     <l n="338">Their efforts , yet resolved with one consent</l>
     <l n="339">To give such act and utterance as they may</l>
     <l n="340">To ecstacy too big to be suppress 'd —</l>
     <l n="341">These , and a thousand images of bliss ,</l>
     <l n="342">With which kind Nature graces every scene ,</l>
     <l n="343">Where cruel man defeats not her design ,</l>
     <l n="344">Impart to the benevolent , who wish</l>
     <l n="345">All that are capable of pleasure pleased ,</l>

     <l n="651">Was never meant , was never used before ,</l>
     <l n="652">To buckram out the memory of a man .</l>
     <l n="653">But hush !— the muse perhaps is too severe ;</l>
     <l n="654">And , with a gravity beyond the size</l>
     <l n="655">And measure of the offence , rebukes a deed</l>
     <l n="656">Less impious than absurd , and owing more</l>
     <l n="657">To want of judgment than to wrong design .</l>
     <l n="658">So in the chapel of old Ely House ,</l>
     <l n="659">When wandering Charles , who meant to be the third ,</l>
     <l n="660">Had fled from William , and the news was fresh ,</l>
     <l n="661">The simple clerk , but loyal , did announce ,</l>
     <l n="662">And eke did rear right merrily , two staves ,</l>
     <l n="663">Sung to the praise and glory of King George !</l>
     <l n="664">— Man praises man ; and Garrick 's memory next ,</l>
     <l n="665">When time hath somewhat mellow 'd it , and made</l>
     <l n="666">The idol of our worship while he lived</l>
     <l n="667">The god of our idolatry once more ,</l>
     <l n="668">Shall have its altar ; and the world shall go</l>
     <l n="669">In pilgrimage to bow before his shrine .</l>
     <l n="670">The theatre , too small , shall suffocate</l>
     <l n="671">Its squeezed contents , and more than it admits</l>
     <l n="672">Shall sigh at their exclusion , and return</l>
     <l n="673">Ungratified : for there some noble lord</l>
     <l n="674">Shall stuff his shoulders with king Richard 's bunch ,</l>
     <l n="675">Or wrap himself in Hamlet 's inky cloak ,</l>
     <l n="676">And strut , and storm , and straddle , stamp , and stare ,</l>
     <l n="677">To show the world how Garrick did not act —</l>
     <l n="678">For Garrick was a worshipper himself ;</l>
     <l n="679">He drew the liturgy , and framed the rites</l>
     <l n="680">And solemn ceremonial of the day ,</l>
     <l n="681">And call 'd the world to worship on the banks</l>
     <l n="682">Of Avon , famed in song . Ah , pleasant proof</l>
     <l n="683">That piety has still in human hearts</l>
     <l n="684">Some place , a spark or two not yet extinct .</l>
     <l n="685">The mulberry-tree was hung with blooming wreaths ;</l>
     <l n="686">The mulberry-tree stood centre of the dance ;</l>
     <l n="687">The mulberry-tree was hymn 'd with dulcet airs ;</l>
     <l n="688">And from his touchwood trunk the mulberry-tree</l>
     <l n="689">Supplied such relics as devotion holds</l>
     <l n="690">Still sacred , and preserves with pious care .</l>
     <l n="691">So ‘ twas a hallow 'd time : decorum reign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="692">And mirth without offence . No few return 'd ,</l>
     <l n="693">Doubtless much edified , and all refresh 'd .</l>
     <l n="694">— Man praises man . The rabble , all alive ,</l>
     <l n="695">From tippling benches , cellars , stalls , and styes ,</l>
     <l n="696">Swarm in the streets . The statesman of the day ,</l>
     <l n="697">A pompous and slow-moving pageant , comes .</l>
     <l n="698">Some shout him , and some hang upon his car ,</l>
     <l n="699">To gaze in his eyes , and bless him . Maidens wave</l>
     <l n="700">Their kerchiefs , and old women weep for joy ;</l>
     <l n="701">While others , not so satisfied , unhorse</l>
     <l n="702">The gilded equipage , and turning loose</l>
     <l n="703">His steeds , usurp a place they well deserve .</l>
     <l n="704">Why ? what has charm 'd them ? Hath he saved the state ?</l>
     <l n="705">No . Doth he purpose its salvation ? No .</l>
     <l n="706">Enchanting novelty , that moon at full ,</l>
     <l n="707">That finds out every crevice of the head</l>
     <l n="708">That is not sound and perfect , hath in theirs</l>
     <l n="709">Wrought this disturbance . But the wane is near</l>
     <l n="710">And his own cattle must suffice him soon .</l>
     <l n="711">Thus idly do we waste the breath of praise ,</l>
     <l n="712">And dedicate a tribute , in its use</l>
     <l n="713">And just direction sacred , to a thing</l>
     <l n="714">Doom 'd to the dust , or lodged already there .</l>
     <l n="715">Encomium in old time was poet 's work ;</l>
     <l n="716">But poets , having lavishly long since</l>
     <l n="717">Exhausted all materials of the art ,</l>
     <l n="718">The task now falls into the public hand ;</l>
     <l n="719">And I , contented with an humble theme ,</l>
     <l n="720">Have pour 'd my stream of panegyric down</l>
     <l n="721">The vale of Nature , where it creeps and winds</l>
     <l n="722">Among her lovely works with a secure</l>
     <l n="723">And unambitious course , reflecting clear ,</l>
     <l n="724">If not the virtues , yet the worth , of brutes .</l>
     <l n="725">And I am recompensed , and deem the toils</l>
     <l n="726">Of poetry not lost , if verse of mine</l>
     <l n="727">May stand between an animal and woe ,</l>
     <l n="728">And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge .</l>
     <l n="729">The groans of Nature in this nether world ,</l>
     <l n="730">Which heaven has heard for ages , have an end .</l>
     <l n="731">Foretold by prophets , and by poets sung ,</l>
     <l n="732">Whose fire was kindled at the prophets ’ lamp ,</l>
     <l n="733">The time of rest , the promised sabbath , comes .</l>
     <l n="734">Six thousand years of sorrow have well nigh</l>
     <l n="735">Fulfill 'd their tardy and disastrous course</l>
     <l n="736">Over a sinful world ; and what remains</l>
     <l n="737">Of this tempestuous state of human things</l>
     <l n="738">Is merely as the working of a sea</l>
     <l n="739">Before a calm , that rocks itself to rest :</l>
     <l n="740">For He , whose car the winds are , and the clouds</l>
     <l n="741">The dust that waits upon his sultry march ,</l>
     <l n="742">When sin hath moved him , and his wrath is hot ,</l>
     <l n="743">Shall visit earth in mercy ; shall descend</l>
     <l n="744">Propitious in his chariot paved with love ;</l>
     <l n="745">And what his storms have blasted and defaced</l>
     <l n="746">For man 's revolt , shall with a smile repair .</l>
     <l n="747">Sweet is the harp of prophecy ; too sweet</l>
     <l n="748">Not to be wrong 'd by a mere mortal touch :</l>
     <l n="749">Nor can the wonders it records be sung</l>
     <l n="750">To meaner music , and not suffer loss .</l>
     <l n="751">But when a poet , or when one like me ,</l>
     <l n="752">Happy to rove among poetic flowers ,</l>
     <l n="753">Though poor in skill to rear them , lights at last</l>
     <l n="754">On some fair theme , some theme divinely fair ,</l>
     <l n="755">Such is the impulse and the spur he feels ,</l>
     <l n="756">To give it praise proportion 'd to its worth ,</l>
     <l n="757">That not to attempt it , arduous as he deems</l>
     <l n="758">The labour , were a task more arduous still .</l>
     <l n="759">O scenes surpassing fable , and yet true ,</l>
     <l n="760">Scenes of accomplish 'd bliss ! which who can see ,</l>
     <l n="761">Though but in distant prospect , and not feel</l>
     <l n="762">His soul refresh 'd with foretaste of the joy ?</l>
     <l n="763">Rivers of gladness water all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="764">And clothe all climes with beauty ; the reproach</l>
     <l n="765">Of barrenness is past . The fruitful field</l>
     <l n="766">Laughs with abundance ; and the land , once lean ,</l>
     <l n="767">Or fertile only in its own disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="768">Exults to see its thistly curse repeal 'd .</l>
     <l n="769">The various seasons woven into one ,</l>
     <l n="770">And that one season an eternal spring ,</l>
     <l n="771">The garden fears no blight , and needs no fence ,</l>
     <l n="772">For there is none to covet , all are full .</l>
     <l n="773">The lion , and the libbard , and the bear</l>
     <l n="774">Graze with the fearless flocks ; all bask at noon</l>
     <l n="775">Together , or all gambol in the shade</l>
     <l n="776">Of the same grove , and drink one common stream .</l>
     <l n="777">Antipathies are none . No foe to man</l>
     <l n="778">Lurks in the serpent now : the mother sees ,</l>
     <l n="779">And smiles to see , her infant 's playful hand</l>
     <l n="780">Stretch 'd forth to dally with the crested worm ,</l>
     <l n="781">To stroke his azure neck , or to receive</l>
     <l n="782">The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue .</l>
     <l n="783">All creatures worship man , and all mankind</l>
     <l n="784">One Lord , one Father . Error has no place ;</l>
     <l n="785">That creeping pestilence is driven away ;</l>
     <l n="786">The breath of heaven has chased it . In the heart</l>
     <l n="787">No passion touches a discordant string ,</l>
     <l n="788">But all is harmony and love . Disease</l>
     <l n="789">Is not : the pure and uncontaminate blood</l>
     <l n="790">Holds its due course , nor fears the frost of age .</l>
     <l n="791">One song employs all nations ; and all cry ,</l>
     <l n="792">“ Worthy the Lamb , for he was slain for us ! ”</l>
     <l n="793">The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks</l>
     <l n="794">Shout to each other , and the mountain tops</l>
     <l n="795">From distant mountains catch the flying joy ;</l>
     <l n="796">Till , nation after nation taught the strain ,</l>
     <l n="797">Earth rolls the rapturous Hosanna round .</l>
     <l n="798">Behold the measure of the promise fill 'd ;</l>
     <l n="799">See Salem built , the labour of a God ;</l>
     <l n="800">Bright as a sun , the sacred city shines ;</l>
     <l n="801">All kingdoms and all princes of the earth</l>
     <l n="802">Flock to that light ; the glory of all lands</l>
     <l n="803">Flows into her ; unbounded is her joy ,</l>
     <l n="804">And endless her increase . Thy rams are there ,</l>
     <l n="805">Nebaioth , and the flocks of Kedar there ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 817 ]</span></l>
     <l n="806">The looms of Ormus , and the mines of Ind ,</l>
     <l n="807">And Saba 's spicy groves , pay tribute there .</l>
     <l n="808">Praise is in all her gates : upon her walls ,</l>
     <l n="809">And in her streets , and in her spacious courts ,</l>
     <l n="810">Is heard salvation . Eastern Java there</l>
     <l n="811">Kneels with the native of the farthest west ;</l>
     <l n="812">And Æthiopia spreads abroad the hand ,</l>
     <l n="813">And worships . Her report has travell 'd forth</l>
     <l n="814">Into all lands . From every clime they come</l>
     <l n="815">To see thy beauty , and to share thy joy ,</l>
     <l n="816">O Sion ! an assembly such as earth</l>
     <l n="817">Saw never , such as Heaven stoops down to see .</l>
     <l n="818">Thus heavenward all things tend . For all were once</l>
     <l n="819">Perfect , and all must be at length restored .</l>
     <l n="820">So God has greatly purposed ; who would else</l>
     <l n="821">In his dishonour 'd works himself endure</l>
     <l n="822">Dishonour , and be wrong 'd without redress .</l>
     <l n="823">Haste , then , and wheel away a shatter 'd world ,</l>
     <l n="824">Ye slow-revolving seasons ! we would see</l>
     <l n="825">( A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet )</l>
     <l n="826">A world that does not dread and hate his law</l>
     <l n="827">And suffer for its crime ; would learn how fair</l>
     <l n="828">The creature is that God pronounces good ,</l>
     <l n="829">How pleasant in itself what pleases him .</l>
     <l n="830">Here every drop of honey hides a sting ;</l>
     <l n="831">Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers ;</l>
     <l n="832">And e'en the joy that haply some poor heart</l>
     <l n="833">Derives from heaven , pure as the fountain is ,</l>
     <l n="834">Is sullied in the stream , taking a taint</l>
     <l n="835">From touch of human lips , at best impure .</l>
     <l n="836">O for a world in principle as chaste</l>
     <l n="837">As this is gross and selfish ! over which</l>
     <l n="838">Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway ,</l>
     <l n="839">That govern all things here , shouldering aside</l>
     <l n="840">The meek and modest Truth , and forcing her</l>
     <l n="841">To seek a refuge from the tongue of Strife</l>
     <l n="842">In nooks obscure , far from the ways of men :</l>
     <l n="843">Where Violence shall never lift the sword ,</l>
     <l n="844">Nor Cunning justify the proud man 's wrong ,</l>
     <l n="845">Leaving the poor no remedy but tears :</l>
     <l n="846">Where he , that fills an office , shall esteem</l>
     <l n="847">The occasion it presents of doing good</l>
     <l n="848">More than the perquisite : where Law shall speak</l>
     <l n="849">Seldom , and never but as Wisdom prompts</l>
     <l n="850">And Equity ; not jealous more to guard</l>
     <l n="851">A worthless form , than to decide aright :—</l>
     <l n="852">Where Fashion shall not sanctify abuse ,</l>
     <l n="853">Nor smooth Good-breeding ( supplemental grace )</l>
     <l n="854">With lean performance ape the work of Love !</l>
     <l n="855">Come then , and , added to thy many crowns ,</l>
     <l n="856">Receive yet one , the crown of all the earth ,</l>
     <l n="857">Thou who alone art worthy ! It was thine</l>
     <l n="858">By ancient covenant , ere Nature 's birth ;</l>
     <l n="859">And thou hast made it thine by purchase since ,</l>

     <l n="861">Thy saints proclaim thee king ; and in their hearts</l>
     <l n="862">Thy title is engraven with a pen</l>
     <l n="863">Dipp 'd in the fountain of eternal love .</l>
     <l n="864">Thy saints proclaim thee king ; and thy delay</l>
     <l n="865">Gives courage to their foes , who , could they see</l>
     <l n="866">The dawn of thy last advent , long desired ,</l>
     <l n="867">Would creep into the bowels of the hills ,</l>
     <l n="868">And flee for safety to the falling rocks .</l>
     <l n="869">The very spirit of the world is tired</l>
     <l n="870">Of its own taunting question , ask 'd so long ,</l>
     <l n="871">“ Where is the promise of your Lord 's approach ? ”</l>
     <l n="872">The infidel has shot his bolts away ,</l>
     <l n="873">Till , his exhausted quiver yielding none ,</l>
     <l n="874">He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="875">And aims them at the shield of Truth again .</l>
     <l n="876">The veil is rent , rent too by priestly hands ,</l>

     <l n="878">And all the mysteries to faith proposed ,</l>
     <l n="879">Insulted and traduced , are cast aside ,</l>
     <l n="880">As useless , to the moles and to the bats .</l>
     <l n="881">They now are deem 'd the faithful , and are praised ;</l>
     <l n="882">Who , constant only in rejecting thee ,</l>
     <l n="883">Deny thy Godhead with a martyr 's zeal ,</l>
     <l n="884">And quit their office for their error 's sake .</l>
     <l n="885">Blind , and in love with darkness ! yet e'en these</l>
     <l n="886">Worthy , compared with sycophants , who kneel</l>

     <l n="888">So fares thy church . But how thy church may fare</l>
     <l n="889">The world takes little thought . Who will may preach ,</l>
     <l n="890">And what they will . All pastors are alike</l>
     <l n="891">To wandering sheep , resolved to follow none .</l>
     <l n="892">Two gods divide them all — Pleasure and Gain :</l>
     <l n="893">For these they live , they sacrifice to these ,</l>
     <l n="894">And in their service wage perpetual war</l>
     <l n="895">With Conscience and with thee . Lust in their hearts ,</l>
     <l n="896">And mischief in their hands , they roam the earth</l>
     <l n="897">To prey upon each other : stubborn , fierce ,</l>
     <l n="898">High-minded , foaming out their own disgrace .</l>
     <l n="899">Thy prophets speak of such ; and , noting down</l>
     <l n="900">The features of the last degenerate times ,</l>
     <l n="901">Exhibit every lineament of these .</l>
     <l n="902">Come then , and , added to thy many crowns ,</l>
     <l n="903">Receive yet one , as radiant as the rest ,</l>
     <l n="904">Due to thy last and most effectual work ,</l>
     <l n="905">Thy word fulfill 'd , the conquest of a world !</l>
     <l n="906">He is the happy man whose life e'en now</l>
     <l n="907">Shows somewhat of that happier life to come ;</l>
     <l n="908">Who , doom 'd to an obscure but tranquil state ,</l>
     <l n="909">Is pleased with it , and , were he free to choose ,</l>
     <l n="910">Would make his fate his choice ; whom peace , the fruit</l>
     <l n="911">Of virtue , and whom virtue , fruit of faith ,</l>
     <l n="912">Prepare for happiness ; bespeak him one</l>
     <l n="913">Content indeed to sojourn while he must</l>
     <l n="914">Below the skies , but having there his home .</l>
     <l n="915">The world o'erlooks him in her busy search</l>
     <l n="916">Of objects , more illustrious in her view ;</l>
     <l n="917">And , occupied as earnestly as she ,</l>
     <l n="918">Though more sublimely , he o'erlooks the world .</l>
     <l n="919">She scorns his pleasures , for she knows them not ;</l>
     <l n="920">He seeks not hers , for he has proved them vain .</l>
     <l n="921">He cannot skim the ground like summer birds</l>
     <l n="922">Pursuing gilded flies ; and such he deems</l>
     <l n="923">Her honours , her emoluments , her joys .</l>
     <l n="924">Therefore in Contemplation is his bliss ,</l>
     <l n="925">Whose power is such , that whom she lifts from earth</l>
     <l n="926">She makes familiar with a heaven unseen ,</l>
     <l n="927">And shows him glories yet to be revealed .</l>
     <l n="928">Not slothful he , though seeming unemploy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="929">And censured oft as useless . Stillest streams</l>
     <l n="930">Oft water fairest meadows , and the bird</l>
     <l n="931">That flutters least is longest on the wing .</l>
     <l n="932">Ask him , indeed , what trophies he has raised ,</l>
     <l n="933">Or what achievements of immortal fame</l>
     <l n="934">He purposes , and he shall answer — None .</l>
     <l n="935">His warfare is within . There unfatigued</l>
     <l n="936">His fervent spirit labours . There he fights ,</l>
     <l n="937">And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself ,</l>
     <l n="938">And never-withering wreaths , compared with which</l>
     <l n="939">The laurels that a Cæsar reaps are weeds .</l>
     <l n="940">Perhaps the self-approving haughty world ,</l>
     <l n="941">That as she sweeps him with her whistling silks</l>
     <l n="942">Scarce deigns to notice him , or , if she see ,</l>
     <l n="943">Deems him a cypher in the works of God ,</l>
     <l n="944">Receives advantage from his noiseless hours ,</l>
     <l n="945">Of which she little dreams . Perhaps she owes</l>
     <l n="946">Her sunshine and her rain , her blooming spring</l>
     <l n="947">And plenteous harvest , to the prayer he makes ,</l>
     <l n="948">When , Isaac-like , the solitary saint</l>
     <l n="949">Walks forth to meditate at even-tide ,</l>
     <l n="950">And think on her , who thinks not for herself .</l>
     <l n="951">Forgive him , then , thou bustler in concerns</l>
     <l n="952">Of little worth , an idler in the best ,</l>
     <l n="953">If , author of no mischief and some good ,</l>
     <l n="954">He seek his proper happiness by means</l>
     <l n="955">That may advance , but cannot hinder , thine .</l>
     <l n="956">Nor , though he tread the secret path of life ,</l>
     <l n="957">Engage no notice , and enjoy much ease ,</l>
     <l n="958">Account him an encumbrance on the state ,</l>
     <l n="959">Receiving benefits , and rendering none .</l>
     <l n="960">His sphere , though humble , if that humble sphere</l>
     <l n="961">Shine with his fair example , and though small</l>
     <l n="962">His influence , if that influence all be spent</l>
     <l n="963">In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife ,</l>
     <l n="964">In aiding helpless indigence , in works</l>
     <l n="965">From which at least a grateful few derive</l>
     <l n="966">Some taste of comfort in a world of woe ;</l>
     <l n="967">Then let the supercilious great confess</l>
     <l n="968">He serves his country , recompenses well</l>
     <l n="969">The state , beneath the shadow of whose vine</l>
     <l n="970">He sits secure , and in the scale of life</l>
     <l n="971">Holds no ignoble , though a slighted , place .</l>
     <l n="972">The man , whose virtues are more felt than seen ,</l>
     <l n="973">Must drop indeed the hope of public praise ;</l>
     <l n="974">But he may boast , what few that win it can ,</l>
     <l n="975">That , if his country stand not by his skill ,</l>
     <l n="976">At least his follies have not wrought her fall .</l>
     <l n="977">Polite Refinement offers him in vain</l>
     <l n="978">Her golden tube , through which a sensual world</l>
     <l n="979">Draws gross impurity , and likes it well ,</l>
     <l n="980">The neat conveyance hiding all the offence .</l>
     <l n="981">Not that he peevishly rejects a mode</l>
     <l n="982">Because that world adopts it . If it bear</l>
     <l n="983">The stamp and clear impression of good sense ,</l>
     <l n="984">And be not costly more than of true worth ,</l>
     <l n="985">He puts it on , and , for decorum sake ,</l>
     <l n="986">Can wear it e'en as gracefully as she .</l>
     <l n="987">She judges of refinement by the eye ,</l>
     <l n="988">He by the test of conscience , and a heart</l>
     <l n="989">Not soon deceived ; aware that what is base</l>
     <l n="990">No polish can make sterling ; and that vice ,</l>
     <l n="991">Though well perfumed and elegantly dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="992">Like an unburied carcass trick 'd with flowers</l>
     <l n="993">Is but a garnish 'd nuisance , fitter far</l>
     <l n="994">For cleanly riddance than for fair attire .</l>
     <l n="995">So life glides smoothly and by stealth away ,</l>
     <l n="996">More golden than that age of fabled gold</l>
     <l n="997">Renown 'd in ancient song ; not vex 'd with care</l>
     <l n="998">Or stain 'd with guilt , beneficent , approved</l>
     <l n="999">Of God and man , and peaceful in its end .</l>
     <l n="1000">So glide my life away ! and so , at last ,</l>
     <l n="1001">My share of duties decently fulfill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="1002">May some disease , not tardy to perform</l>
     <l n="1003">Its destined office , yet with gentle stroke ,</l>
     <l n="1004">Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat ,</l>
     <l n="1005">Beneath the turf that I have often trod .</l>
     <l n="1006">It shall not grieve me then that once , when call 'd</l>
     <l n="1007">To dress a Sofa with the flowers of verse ,</l>
     <l n="1008">I play 'd awhile , obedient to the fair ,</l>
     <l n="1009">With that light task ; but soon , to please her more ,</l>
     <l n="1010">Whom flowers alone I knew would little please ,</l>
     <l n="1011">Let fall the unfinish 'd wreath , and roved for fruit ;</l>
     <l n="1012">Roved far , and gather 'd much : some harsh , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="1013">Pick 'd from the thorns and briars of reproof ,</l>
     <l n="1014">But wholesome , well-digested ; grateful some</l>
     <l n="1015">To palates that can taste immortal truth ;</l>
     <l n="1016">Insipid else , and sure to be despised .</l>
     <l n="1017">But all is in His hand , whose praise I seek .</l>
     <l n="1018">In vain the poet sings , and the world hears ,</l>
     <l n="1019">If he regard not , though divine the theme .</l>
     <l n="1020">‘ Tis not in artful measures , in the chime</l>
     <l n="1021">And idle tinkling of a minstrel 's lyre ,</l>
     <l n="1022">To charm His ear , whose eye is on the heart ;</l>
     <l n="1023">Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain ,</l>
     <l n="1024">Whose approbation — prosper even mine .</l>

    <head>AN EPISTLE TO JOSEPH HILL , ESQ .</head>
     <l n="1">Dear Joseph — five-and-twenty years ago —</l>
     <l n="2">Alas , how time escapes !— ‘ tis even so —</l>
     <l n="3">With frequent intercourse , and always sweet ,</l>
     <l n="4">And always friendly , we were wont to cheat</l>
     <l n="5">A tedious hour — and now we never meet !</l>
     <l n="6">As some grave gentleman in Terence says ,</l>
     <l n="7">( ‘ Twas therefore much the same in ancient days ,)</l>
     <l n="8">Good lack , we know not what to-morrow brings —</l>
     <l n="9">Strange fluctuation of all human things !</l>
     <l n="10">True . Changes will befall , and friends may part ,</l>
     <l n="11">But distance only cannot change the heart :</l>
     <l n="12">And , were I call 'd to prove the assertion true ,</l>
     <l n="13">One proof should serve — a reference to you .</l>
     <l n="14">Whence comes it then , that , in the wane of life ,</l>
     <l n="15">Though nothing have occurr 'd to kindle strife ,</l>
     <l n="16">We find the friends we fancied we had won ,</l>
     <l n="17">Though numerous once , reduced to few or none ?</l>
     <l n="18">Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch ?</l>
     <l n="19">No ; gold they seem 'd , but they were never such .</l>
     <l n="20">Horatio 's servant once , with bow and cringe ,</l>
     <l n="21">Swinging the parlour door upon its hinge ,</l>
     <l n="22">Dreading a negative , and overawed</l>
     <l n="23">Lest he should trespass , begg 'd to go abroad .</l>
     <l n="24">Go , fellow !— whither ?— turning short about —</l>
     <l n="25">Nay — stay at home — you 're always going out .</l>
     <l n="26">‘ Tis but a step , sir , just at the street 's end .—</l>
     <l n="27">For what ?— An please you , sir , to see a friend .—</l>
     <l n="28">A friend ! Horatio cried , and seem 'd to start —</l>
     <l n="29">Yea marry shalt thou , and with all my heart .</l>
     <l n="30">And fetch my cloak ; for though the night be raw ,</l>
     <l n="31">I 'll see him too — the first I ever saw .</l>
     <l n="32">I knew the man , and knew his nature mild ,</l>
     <l n="33">And was his plaything often when a child ;</l>
     <l n="34">But somewhat at that moment pinch 'd him close ,</l>
     <l n="35">Else he was seldom bitter or morose .</l>
     <l n="36">Perhaps , his confidence just then betray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="37">His grief might prompt him with the speech he made ;</l>
     <l n="38">Perhaps ‘ twas mere good humour gave it birth ,</l>
     <l n="39">The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth .</l>
     <l n="40">Howe'er it was , his language , in my mind ,</l>
     <l n="41">Bespoke at least a man that knew mankind .</l>
     <l n="42">But not to moralize too much , and strain</l>
     <l n="43">To prove an evil of which all complain ;</l>
     <l n="44">( I hate long arguments verbosely spun ;)</l>
     <l n="45">One story more , dear Hill , and I have done .</l>
     <l n="46">Once on a time an emperor , a wise man ,</l>
     <l n="47">No matter where , in China or Japan ,</l>
     <l n="48">Decreed that whosoever should offend</l>
     <l n="49">Against the well-known duties of a friend ,</l>
     <l n="50">Convicted once , should ever after wear</l>
     <l n="51">But half a coat , and show his bosom bare .</l>
     <l n="52">The punishment importing this , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="53">That all was naught within , and all found out .</l>
     <l n="54">Oh , happy Britain ! we have not to fear</l>
     <l n="55">Such hard and arbitrary measure here ;</l>
     <l n="56">Else , could a law like that which I relate</l>
     <l n="57">Once have the sanction of our triple state ,</l>
     <l n="58">Some few , that I have known in days of old ,</l>
     <l n="59">Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold ;</l>
     <l n="60">While you , my friend , whatever wind should blow ,</l>
     <l n="61">Might traverse England safely to and fro ,</l>
     <l n="62">An honest man , close-button 'd to the chin ,</l>
     <l n="63">Broad-cloth without , and a warm heart within .</l>

   <p>To the Rev . William Cawthorne Unwin , Rector of Stock in Essex , the tutor of his two sons , the following poem , recommending private tuition in preference to an education at school , is inscribed , by his affectionate friend ,</p>

     <l n="1">It is not from his form , in which we trace</l>
     <l n="2">Strength join 'd with beauty , dignity with grace ,</l>
     <l n="3">That man , the master of this globe , derives</l>
     <l n="4">His right of empire over all that lives .</l>
     <l n="5">That form , indeed , the associate of a mind</l>
     <l n="6">Vast in its powers , ethereal in its kind ,</l>
     <l n="7">That form , the labour of Almighty skill ,</l>
     <l n="8">Framed for the service of a freeborn will ,</l>
     <l n="9">Asserts precedence , and bespeaks control ,</l>
     <l n="10">But borrows all its grandeur from the soul .</l>
     <l n="11">Hers is the state , the splendour , and the throne ,</l>
     <l n="12">An intellectual kingdom , all her own .</l>
     <l n="13">For her the memory fills her ample page</l>
     <l n="14">With truths pour 'd down from every distant age ;</l>
     <l n="15">For her amasses an unbounded store ,</l>
     <l n="16">The wisdom of great nations , now no more ;</l>
     <l n="17">Though laden , not encumber 'd with her spoil ;</l>
     <l n="18">Laborious , yet unconscious of her toil ;</l>
     <l n="19">When copiously supplied , then most enlarged ;</l>
     <l n="20">Still to be fed , and not to be surcharged .</l>
     <l n="21">For her the Fancy , roving unconfined ,</l>
     <l n="22">The present muse of every pensive mind ,</l>
     <l n="23">Works magic wonders , adds a brighter hue</l>
     <l n="24">To Nature 's scenes than Nature ever knew .</l>
     <l n="25">At her command winds rise and waters roar ,</l>
     <l n="26">Again she lays them slumbering on the shore ;</l>
     <l n="27">With flower and fruit the wilderness supplies ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or bids the rocks in ruder pomp arise .</l>
     <l n="29">For her the Judgment , umpire in the strife</l>
     <l n="30">That Grace and Nature have to wage through life ,</l>
     <l n="31">Quick-sighted arbiter of good and ill ,</l>
     <l n="32">Appointed sage preceptor to the Will ,</l>
     <l n="33">Condemns , approves , and with a faithful voice</l>
     <l n="34">Guides the decision of a doubtful choice .</l>
     <l n="35">Why did the fiat of a God give birth</l>
     <l n="36">To yon fair Sun and his attendant Earth ?</l>
     <l n="37">And , when descending he resigns the skies ,</l>
     <l n="38">Why takes the gentler Moon her turn to rise ,</l>
     <l n="39">Whom Ocean feels through all his countless waves ,</l>
     <l n="40">And owns her power on every shore he laves ?</l>
     <l n="41">Why do the seasons still enrich the year ,</l>
     <l n="42">Fruitful and young as in their first career ?</l>
     <l n="43">Spring hangs her infant blossoms on the trees ,</l>
     <l n="44">Rock 'd in the cradle of the western breeze ;</l>
     <l n="45">Summer in haste the thriving charge receives</l>
     <l n="46">Beneath the shade of her expanded leaves ,</l>
     <l n="47">Till Autumn 's fiercer heats and plenteous dews</l>
     <l n="48">Dye them at last in all their glowing hues .—</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Twere wild profusion all , and bootless waste ,</l>
     <l n="50">Power misemploy 'd , munificence misplaced ,</l>
     <l n="51">Had not its Author dignified the plan ,</l>
     <l n="52">And crown 'd it with the majesty of man .</l>
     <l n="53">Thus form 'd , thus placed , intelligent , and taught ,</l>
     <l n="54">Look where he will , the wonders God has wrought ,</l>
     <l n="55">The wildest scorner of his Maker 's laws</l>
     <l n="56">Finds in a sober moment time to pause ,</l>
     <l n="57">To press the important question on his heart ,</l>
     <l n="58">“ Why form 'd at all , and wherefore as thou art ? ”</l>
     <l n="59">If man be what he seems , this hour a slave ,</l>
     <l n="60">The next mere dust and ashes in the grave ;</l>
     <l n="61">Endued with reason only to descry</l>
     <l n="62">His crimes and follies with an aching eye ;</l>
     <l n="63">With passions , just that he may prove , with pain ,</l>
     <l n="64">The force he spends against their fury vain ;</l>
     <l n="65">And if , soon after having burnt , by turns ,</l>
     <l n="66">With every lust with which frail Nature burns ,</l>
     <l n="67">His being end where death dissolves the bond ,</l>
     <l n="68">The tomb take all , and all be blank beyond ;</l>
     <l n="69">Then he , of all that Nature has brought forth ,</l>
     <l n="70">Stands self-impeach 'd the creature of least worth ,</l>
     <l n="71">And , useless while he lives , and when he dies ,</l>
     <l n="72">Brings into doubt the wisdom of the skies .</l>
     <l n="73">Truths that the learn 'd pursue with eager thought</l>
     <l n="74">Are not important always as dear-bought ,</l>
     <l n="75">Proving at last , though told in pompous strains ,</l>
     <l n="76">A childish waste of philosophic pains ;</l>
     <l n="77">But truths on which depends our main concern ,</l>
     <l n="78">That ‘ tis our shame and misery not to learn ,</l>
     <l n="79">Shine by the side of every path we tread</l>
     <l n="80">With such a lustre , he that runs may read .</l>
     <l n="81">‘ Tis true that , if to trifle life away</l>
     <l n="82">Down to the sunset of their latest day ,</l>
     <l n="83">Then perish on futurity 's wide shore</l>
     <l n="84">Like fleeting exhalations , found no more ,</l>
     <l n="85">Were all that heaven required of human kind ,</l>
     <l n="86">And all the plan their destiny design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="87">What none could reverence all might justly blame ,</l>
     <l n="88">And man would breathe but for his Maker 's shame .</l>
     <l n="89">But reason heard , and nature well perused ,</l>
     <l n="90">At once the dreaming mind is disabused .</l>
     <l n="91">If all we find possessing earth , sea , air ,</l>
     <l n="92">Reflect His attributes who placed them there ,</l>
     <l n="93">Fulfil the purpose , and appear design 'd</l>
     <l n="94">Proofs of the wisdom of the all-seeing mind ,</l>
     <l n="95">‘ Tis plain the creature , whom he chose to invest</l>
     <l n="96">With kingship and dominion o'er the rest ,</l>
     <l n="97">Received his nobler nature , and was made</l>
     <l n="98">Fit for the power in which he stands arrayed ;</l>
     <l n="99">That first , or last , hereafter , if not here ,</l>

     <l n="108">Nor ignorantly wandering miss the skies .</l>
     <l n="109">In early days the conscience has in most</l>
     <l n="110">A quickness , which in later life is lost :</l>
     <l n="111">Preserved from guilt by salutary fears ,</l>
     <l n="112">Or guilty soon relenting into tears .</l>
     <l n="113">Too careless often , as our years proceed ,</l>
     <l n="114">What friends we sort with , or what books we read ,</l>
     <l n="115">Our parents yet exert a prudent care</l>
     <l n="116">To feed our infant minds with proper fare ;</l>
     <l n="117">And wisely store the nursery by degrees</l>
     <l n="118">With wholesome learning , yet acquired with ease .</l>
     <l n="119">Neatly secured from being soil 'd or torn</l>
     <l n="120">Beneath a pane of thin translucent horn ,</l>

     <l n="124">Which children use , and parsons — when they preach .</l>
     <l n="125">Lisping our syllables , we scramble next</l>
     <l n="126">Through moral narrative , or sacred text ;</l>
     <l n="127">And learn with wonder how this world began ,</l>
     <l n="128">Who made , who marr 'd , and who has ransom 'd man :</l>
     <l n="129">Points which , unless the Scripture made them plain ,</l>
     <l n="130">The wisest heads might agitate in vain .</l>
     <l n="131">Oh thou , whom , borne on fancy 's eager wing</l>

     <l n="453">A boyish friendship may so soon decline ,</l>
     <l n="454">‘ Twere wiser sure to inspire a little heart</l>
     <l n="455">With just abhorrence of so mean a part ,</l>
     <l n="456">Than set your son to work at a vile trade</l>
     <l n="457">For wages so unlikely to be paid .</l>
     <l n="458">Our public hives of puerile resort ,</l>
     <l n="459">That are of chief and most approved report ,</l>
     <l n="460">To such base hopes , in many a sordid soul ,</l>
     <l n="461">Owe their repute in part , but not the whole .</l>
     <l n="462">A principle , whose proud pretensions pass</l>
     <l n="463">Unquestion 'd , though the jewel be but glass —</l>
     <l n="464">That with a world , not often over-nice ,</l>
     <l n="465">Ranks as a virtue , and is yet a vice ;</l>
     <l n="466">Or rather a gross compound , justly tried ,</l>
     <l n="467">Of envy , hatred , jealousy , and pride —</l>
     <l n="468">Contributes most , perhaps , to enhance their fame ;</l>
     <l n="469">And emulation is its specious name .</l>
     <l n="470">Boys , once on fire with that contentious zeal ,</l>
     <l n="471">Feel all the rage that female rivals feel ;</l>
     <l n="472">The prize of beauty in a woman 's eyes</l>
     <l n="473">Not brighter than in theirs the scholar 's prize .</l>
     <l n="474">The spirit of that competition burns</l>
     <l n="475">With all varieties of ill by turns ;</l>
     <l n="476">Each vainly magnifies his own success ,</l>
     <l n="477">Resents his fellow 's , wishes it were less ,</l>
     <l n="478">Exults in his miscarriage if he fail ,</l>
     <l n="479">Deems his reward too great if he prevail ,</l>
     <l n="480">And labours to surpass him day and night ,</l>
     <l n="481">Less for improvement than to tickle spite .</l>
     <l n="482">The spur is powerful , and I grant its force ;</l>
     <l n="483">It pricks the genius forward in its course ,</l>
     <l n="484">Allows short time for play , and none for sloth ;</l>
     <l n="485">And , felt alike by each , advances both :</l>
     <l n="486">But judge , where so much evil intervenes ,</l>
     <l n="487">The end , though plausible , not worth the means .</l>
     <l n="488">Weigh , for a moment , classical desert</l>
     <l n="489">Against a heart depraved and temper hurt ;</l>
     <l n="490">Hurt too perhaps for life ; for early wrong</l>
     <l n="491">Done to the nobler part affects it long ;</l>
     <l n="492">And you are staunch indeed in learning 's cause ,</l>
     <l n="493">If you can crown a discipline , that draws</l>
     <l n="494">Such mischiefs after it , with much applause .</l>
     <l n="495">Connexion form 'd for interest , and endear 'd</l>
     <l n="496">By selfish views , thus censured and cashier 'd ;</l>
     <l n="497">And emulation , as engendering hate ,</l>
     <l n="498">Doom 'd to a no less ignominious fate :</l>
     <l n="499">The props of such proud seminaries fall ,</l>
     <l n="500">The Jachin and the Boaz of them all .</l>
     <l n="501">Great schools rejected then , as those that swell</l>
     <l n="502">Beyond a size that can be managed well ,</l>
     <l n="503">Shall royal institutions miss the bays ,</l>
     <l n="504">And small academies win all the praise ?</l>
     <l n="505">Force not my drift beyond its just intent ,</l>
     <l n="506">I praise a school as Pope a government ;</l>
     <l n="507">So take my judgment in his language dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="508">“ Whate'er is best administer 'd is best . ”</l>
     <l n="509">Few boys are born with talents that excel ,</l>
     <l n="510">But all are capable of living well ;</l>
     <l n="511">Then ask not , whether limited or large ?</l>
     <l n="512">But , watch they strictly , or neglect their charge ?</l>
     <l n="513">If anxious only that their boys may learn ,</l>
     <l n="514">While morals languish , a despised concern ,</l>
     <l n="515">The great and small deserve one common blame ,</l>
     <l n="516">Different in size , but in effect the same .</l>
     <l n="517">Much zeal in virtue 's cause all teachers boast ,</l>
     <l n="518">Though motives of mere lucre sway the most ;</l>
     <l n="519">Therefore in towns and cities they abound ,</l>
     <l n="520">For there the game they seek is easiest found ;</l>
     <l n="521">Though there , in spite of all that care can do ,</l>
     <l n="522">Traps to catch youth are most abundant too .</l>
     <l n="523">If shrewd , and of a well-constructed brain ,</l>
     <l n="524">Keen in pursuit , and vigorous to retain ,</l>
     <l n="525">Your son come forth a prodigy of skill ;</l>
     <l n="526">As , wheresoever taught , so form 'd , he will ;</l>
     <l n="527">The pedagogue , with self-complacent air ,</l>
     <l n="528">Claims more than half the praise as his due share .</l>
     <l n="529">But if , with all his genius , he betray ,</l>
     <l n="530">Not more intelligent than loose and gay ,</l>
     <l n="531">Such vicious habits as disgrace his name ,</l>
     <l n="532">Threaten his health , his fortune , and his fame ;</l>
     <l n="533">Though want of due restraint alone have bred</l>
     <l n="534">The symptoms that you see with so much dread ;</l>
     <l n="535">Unenvied there , he may sustain alone</l>
     <l n="536">The whole reproach , the fault was all his own .</l>
     <l n="537">Oh ! ‘ tis a sight to be with joy perused ,</l>
     <l n="538">By all whom sentiment has not abused ;</l>
     <l n="539">New-fangled sentiment , the boasted grace</l>
     <l n="540">Of those who never feel in the right place ;</l>
     <l n="541">A sight surpass 'd by none that we can show ,</l>
     <l n="542">Though Vestris on one leg still shine below ;</l>
     <l n="543">A father blest with an ingenuous son ,</l>
     <l n="544">Father , and friend , and tutor , all in one .</l>
     <l n="545">How !— turn again to tales long since forgot ,</l>
     <l n="546">Æsop , and Phædrus , and the rest ?— Why not ?</l>
     <l n="547">He will not blush , that has a father 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="548">To take in childish plays a childish part ;</l>
     <l n="549">But bends his sturdy back to any toy</l>
     <l n="550">That youth takes pleasure in , to please his boy :</l>
     <l n="551">Then why resign into a stranger 's hand</l>
     <l n="552">A task as much within your own command ,</l>
     <l n="553">That God and nature , and your interest too ,</l>
     <l n="554">Seem with one voice to delegate to you ?</l>
     <l n="555">Why hire a lodging in a house unknown</l>
     <l n="556">For one whose tenderest thoughts all hover round your own ?</l>
     <l n="557">This second weaning , needless as it is ,</l>
     <l n="558">How does it lacerate both your heart and his !</l>
     <l n="559">The indented stick , that loses day by day ,</l>
     <l n="560">Notch after notch , till all are smooth 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="561">Bears witness , long ere his dismission come ,</l>
     <l n="562">With what intense desire he wants his home .</l>
     <l n="563">But though the joys he hopes beneath your roof</l>
     <l n="564">Bid fair enough to answer in the proof ,</l>
     <l n="565">Harmless , and safe , and natural , as they are ,</l>
     <l n="566">A disappointment waits him even there :</l>
     <l n="567">Arrived , he feels an unexpected change ;</l>
     <l n="568">He blushes , hangs his head , is shy and strange ,</l>
     <l n="569">No longer takes , as once , with fearless ease ,</l>
     <l n="570">His favourite stand between his father 's knees ,</l>
     <l n="571">But seeks the corner of some distant seat ,</l>
     <l n="572">And eyes the door , and watches a retreat ,</l>
     <l n="573">And , least familiar where he should be most ,</l>
     <l n="574">Feels all his happiest privileges lost .</l>
     <l n="575">Alas , poor boy !— the natural effect</l>
     <l n="576">Of love by absence chill 'd into respect .</l>
     <l n="577">Say , what accomplishments , at school acquired ,</l>
     <l n="578">Brings he , to sweeten fruits so undesired ?</l>
     <l n="579">Thou well deserv'st an alienated son ,</l>
     <l n="580">Unless thy conscious heart acknowledge — none ;</l>
     <l n="581">None that , in thy domestic snug recess ,</l>
     <l n="582">He had not made his own with more address ,</l>
     <l n="583">Though some , perhaps , that shock thy feeling mind ,</l>
     <l n="584">And better never learn 'd , or left behind .</l>
     <l n="585">Add too , that , thus estranged , thou canst obtain</l>
     <l n="586">By no kind arts his confidence again ;</l>
     <l n="587">That here begins with most that long complaint</l>
     <l n="588">Of filial frankness lost , and love grown faint ,</l>
     <l n="589">Which , oft neglected , in life 's waning years</l>
     <l n="590">A parent pours into regardless ears .</l>
     <l n="591">Like caterpillars , dangling under trees</l>
     <l n="592">By slender threads , and swinging in the breeze ,</l>
     <l n="593">Which filthily bewray and sore disgrace</l>
     <l n="594">The boughs in which are bred the unseemly race ;</l>
     <l n="595">While every worm industriously weaves</l>
     <l n="596">And winds his web about the rivell 'd leaves ;</l>
     <l n="597">So numerous are the follies that annoy</l>
     <l n="598">The mind and heart of every sprightly boy ;</l>
     <l n="599">Imaginations noxious and perverse ,</l>
     <l n="600">Which admonition can alone disperse .</l>
     <l n="601">The encroaching nuisance asks a faithful hand ,</l>
     <l n="602">Patient , affectionate , of high command ,</l>
     <l n="603">To check the procreation of a breed</l>
     <l n="604">Sure to exhaust the plant on which they feed .</l>
     <l n="605">‘ Tis not enough that Greek or Roman page ,</l>
     <l n="606">At stated hours , his freakish thoughts engage ;</l>
     <l n="607">E'en in his pastimes he requires a friend</l>
     <l n="608">To warn , and teach him safely to unbend ;</l>
     <l n="609">O'er all his pleasures gently to preside ,</l>
     <l n="610">Watch his emotions , and control their tide ;</l>
     <l n="611">And levying thus , and with an easy sway ,</l>
     <l n="612">A tax of profit from his very play ,</l>
     <l n="613">To impress a value , not to be erased ,</l>
     <l n="614">On moments squander 'd else , and running all to waste .</l>
     <l n="615">And seems it nothing in a father 's eye</l>
     <l n="616">That unimproved those many moments fly ?</l>
     <l n="617">And is he well content his son should find</l>
     <l n="618">No nourishment to feed his growing mind ,</l>
     <l n="619">But conjugated verbs and nouns declined ?</l>
     <l n="620">For such is all the mental food purveyed</l>
     <l n="621">By public hackneys in the schooling trade ;</l>
     <l n="622">Who feed a pupil 's intellect with store</l>
     <l n="623">Of syntax , truly , but with little more ;</l>
     <l n="624">Dismiss their cares when they dismiss their flock ,</l>
     <l n="625">Machines themselves , and govern 'd by a clock .</l>
     <l n="626">Perhaps a father , blest with any brains ,</l>
     <l n="627">Would deem it no abuse , or waste of pains ,</l>
     <l n="628">To improve this diet , at no great expense ,</l>
     <l n="629">With savoury truth and wholesome common sense ;</l>
     <l n="630">To lead his son , for prospects of delight ,</l>
     <l n="631">To some not steep , though philosophic , height ,</l>
     <l n="632">Thence to exhibit to his wondering eyes</l>
     <l n="633">Yon circling worlds , their distance , and their size ,</l>
     <l n="634">The moons of Jove , and Saturn 's belted ball ,</l>
     <l n="635">And the harmonious order of them all ;</l>
     <l n="636">To show him in an insect or a flower</l>
     <l n="637">Such microscopic proof of skill and power ,</l>
     <l n="638">As , hid from ages past , God now displays</l>
     <l n="639">To combat atheists with in modern days ;</l>
     <l n="640">To spread the earth before him , and commend ,</l>
     <l n="641">With designation of the finger 's end ,</l>
     <l n="642">Its various parts to his attentive note ,</l>
     <l n="643">Thus bringing home to him the most remote ;</l>
     <l n="644">To teach his heart to glow with generous flame ,</l>
     <l n="645">Caught from the deeds of men of ancient fame ;</l>
     <l n="646">And , more than all , with commendation due ,</l>
     <l n="647">To set some living worthy in his view ,</l>
     <l n="648">Whose fair example may at once inspire</l>
     <l n="649">A wish to copy what he must admire .</l>
     <l n="650">Such knowledge , gain 'd betimes , and which appears ,</l>
     <l n="651">Though solid , not too weighty for his years ,</l>
     <l n="652">Sweet in itself , and not forbidding sport ,</l>
     <l n="653">When health demands it , of athletic sort ,</l>
     <l n="654">Would make him — what some lovely boys have been ,</l>
     <l n="655">And more than one perhaps that I have seen —</l>
     <l n="656">An evidence and reprehension both</l>
     <l n="657">Of the mere schoolboy 's lean and tardy growth .</l>
     <l n="658">Art thou a man professionally tied ,</l>
     <l n="659">With all thy faculties elsewhere applied ,</l>
     <l n="660">Too busy to intend a meaner care</l>
     <l n="661">Than how to enrich thyself , and next thine heir ;</l>
     <l n="662">Or art thou ( as , though rich , perhaps thou art )</l>
     <l n="663">But poor in knowledge , having none to impart :—</l>
     <l n="664">Behold that figure , neat , though plainly clad ;</l>
     <l n="665">His sprightly mingled with a shade of sad ;</l>
     <l n="666">Not of a nimble tongue , though now and then</l>
     <l n="667">Heard to articulate like other men ;</l>
     <l n="668">No jester , and yet lively in discourse ,</l>
     <l n="669">His phrase well chosen , clear , and full of force ;</l>
     <l n="670">And his address , if not quite French in ease ,</l>
     <l n="671">Not English stiff , but frank , and form 'd to please ;</l>
     <l n="672">Low in the world , because he scorns its arts ;</l>
     <l n="673">A man of letters , manners , morals , parts ;</l>
     <l n="674">Unpatronized , and therefore little known ;</l>
     <l n="675">Wise for himself and his few friends alone —</l>
     <l n="676">In him thy well-appointed proxy see ,</l>
     <l n="677">Arm 'd for a work too difficult for thee ;</l>
     <l n="678">Prepared by taste , by learning , and true worth ,</l>
     <l n="679">To form thy son , to strike his genius forth ;</l>
     <l n="680">Beneath thy roof , beneath thine eye , to prove</l>
     <l n="681">The force of discipline when back 'd by love ;</l>
     <l n="682">To double all thy pleasure in thy child ,</l>
     <l n="683">His mind inform 'd , his morals undefiled .</l>
     <l n="684">Safe under such a wing , the boy shall show</l>
     <l n="685">No spots contracted among grooms below ,</l>
     <l n="686">Nor taint his speech with meannesses , design 'd</l>
     <l n="687">By footman Tom for witty and refined .</l>
     <l n="688">There , in his commerce with the liveried herd ,</l>
     <l n="689">Lurks the contagion chiefly to be fear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="690">For since ( so fashion dictates ) all , who claim</l>
     <l n="691">A higher than a mere plebeian fame ,</l>
     <l n="692">Find it expedient , come what mischief may ,</l>
     <l n="693">To entertain a thief or two in pay ,</l>
     <l n="694">( And they that can afford the expense of more ,</l>
     <l n="695">Some half a dozen , and some half a score ,)</l>
     <l n="696">Great cause occurs to save him from a band</l>
     <l n="697">So sure to spoil him , and so near at hand ;</l>
     <l n="698">A point secured , if once he be supplied</l>
     <l n="699">With some such Mentor always at his side .</l>
     <l n="700">Are such men rare ? perhaps they would abound</l>
     <l n="701">Were occupation easier to be found ,</l>
     <l n="702">Were education , else so sure to fail ,</l>
     <l n="703">Conducted on a manageable scale ,</l>
     <l n="704">And schools , that have outlived all just esteem ,</l>
     <l n="705">Exchanged for the secure domestic scheme .—</l>
     <l n="706">But , having found him , be thou duke or earl ,</l>
     <l n="707">Show thou hast sense enough to prize the pearl ,</l>
     <l n="708">And , as thou wouldst the advancement of thine heir</l>
     <l n="709">In all good faculties beneath his care ,</l>
     <l n="710">Respect , as is but rational and just ,</l>
     <l n="711">A man deem 'd worthy of so dear a trust .</l>
     <l n="712">Despised by thee , what more can he expect</l>
     <l n="713">From youthful folly than the same neglect ?</l>
     <l n="714">A flat and fatal negative obtains</l>
     <l n="715">That instant upon all his future pains ;</l>
     <l n="716">His lessons tire , his mild rebukes offend ,</l>
     <l n="717">And all the instructions of thy son 's best friend</l>
     <l n="718">Are a stream choked , or trickling to no end .</l>
     <l n="719">Doom him not then to solitary meals ;</l>
     <l n="720">But recollect that he has sense , and feels ;</l>
     <l n="721">And that , possessor of a soul refined ,</l>
     <l n="722">An upright heart , and cultivated mind ,</l>
     <l n="723">His post not mean , his talents not unknown ,</l>
     <l n="724">He deems it hard to vegetate alone .</l>
     <l n="725">And , if admitted at thy board he sit ,</l>
     <l n="726">Account him no just mark for idle wit ;</l>
     <l n="727">Offend not him , whom modesty restrains</l>
     <l n="728">From repartee , with jokes that he disdains ;</l>
     <l n="729">Much less transfix his feelings with an oath ;</l>
     <l n="730">Nor frown , unless he vanish with the cloth .—</l>
     <l n="731">And , trust me , his utility may reach</l>
     <l n="732">To more than he is hired or bound to teach ;</l>
     <l n="733">Much trash unutter 'd , and some ills undone ,</l>
     <l n="734">Through reverence of the censor of thy son .</l>
     <l n="735">But , if thy table be indeed unclean ,</l>
     <l n="736">Foul with excess , and with discourse obscene ,</l>
     <l n="737">And thou a wretch , whom , following her old plan ,</l>
     <l n="738">The world accounts an honourable man ,</l>
     <l n="739">Because forsooth thy courage has been tried ,</l>
     <l n="740">And stood the test , perhaps on the wrong side ;</l>
     <l n="741">Though thou hadst never grace enough to prove</l>
     <l n="742">That any thing but vice could win thy love ;—</l>
     <l n="743">Or hast thou a polite , card-playing wife ,</l>
     <l n="744">Chain 'd to the routs that she frequents for life ;</l>
     <l n="745">Who , just when industry begins to snore ,</l>
     <l n="746">Flies , wing 'd with joy , to some coach-crowded door ;</l>
     <l n="747">And thrice in every winter throngs thine own</l>
     <l n="748">With half the chariots and sedans in town</l>
     <l n="749">Thyself meanwhile e'en shifting as thou mayst ;</l>
     <l n="750">Not very sober though , nor very chaste ;</l>
     <l n="751">Or is thine house , though less superb thy rank ,</l>
     <l n="752">If not a scene of pleasure , a mere blank ,</l>
     <l n="753">And thou at best , and in thy soberest mood ,</l>

    <head>ON MRS. MONTAGU 'S FEATHER-HANGINGS .</head>
     <l n="1">The birds put off their every hue</l>
     <l n="2">To dress a room for Montagu .</l>
     <l n="3">The peacock sends his heavenly dyes ,</l>
     <l n="4">His rainbows and his starry eyes ;</l>
     <l n="5">The pheasant plumes , which round enfold</l>
     <l n="6">His mantling neck with downy gold ;</l>
     <l n="7">The cock his arch 'd tail 's azure show ;</l>
     <l n="8">And , river-blanch 'd , the swan his snow .</l>
     <l n="9">All tribes beside of Indian name ,</l>
     <l n="10">That glossy shine , or vivid flame ,</l>
     <l n="11">Where rises , and where sets the day ,</l>
     <l n="12">Whate'er they boast of rich and gay ,</l>
     <l n="13">Contribute to the gorgeous plan ,</l>
     <l n="14">Proud to advance it all they can .</l>
     <l n="15">This plumage neither dashing shower ,</l>
     <l n="16">Nor blasts , that shake the dripping bower ,</l>
     <l n="17">Shall drench again or discompose ,</l>
     <l n="18">But , screen 'd from every storm that blows ,</l>
     <l n="19">It boasts a splendour ever new ,</l>
     <l n="20">Safe with protecting Montagu .</l>
     <l n="21">To the same patroness resort ,</l>
     <l n="22">Secure of favour at her court ,</l>
     <l n="23">Strong Genius , from whose forge of thought</l>
     <l n="24">Forms rise , to quick perfection wrought ,</l>
     <l n="25">Which , though new-born , with vigour move ,</l>
     <l n="26">Like Pallas springing arm 'd from Jove —</l>
     <l n="27">Imagination scattering round</l>
     <l n="28">Wild roses over furrow 'd ground ,</l>
     <l n="29">Which Labour of his frown beguile ,</l>
     <l n="30">And teach Philosophy a smile —</l>
     <l n="31">Wit flashing on Religion 's side ,</l>
     <l n="32">Whose fires , to sacred Truth applied ,</l>
     <l n="33">The gem , though luminous before ,</l>
     <l n="34">Obtrude on human notice more ,</l>
     <l n="35">Like sunbeams on the golden height</l>
     <l n="36">Of some tall temple playing bright —</l>
     <l n="37">Well tutor 'd Learning , from his books</l>
     <l n="38">Dismiss 'd with grave , not haughty , looks ,</l>
     <l n="39">Their order on his shelves exact ,</l>
     <l n="40">Not more harmonious or compact</l>
     <l n="41">Than that to which he keeps confined</l>
     <l n="42">The various treasures of his mind —</l>
     <l n="43">All these to Montagu 's repair ,</l>
     <l n="44">Ambitious of a shelter there .</l>
     <l n="45">There Genius , Learning , Fancy , Wit ,</l>
     <l n="46">Their ruffled plumage calm refit ,</l>
     <l n="47">( For stormy troubles loudest roar</l>
     <l n="48">Around their flight who highest soar ,)</l>
     <l n="49">And in her eye , and by her aid ,</l>
     <l n="50">Shine safe without a fear to fade .</l>
     <l n="51">She thus maintains divided sway</l>
     <l n="52">With yon bright regent of the day ;</l>
     <l n="53">The Plume and Poet both we know</l>
     <l n="54">Their lustre to his influence owe ;</l>
     <l n="55">And she the works of Phoebus aiding ,</l>
     <l n="56">Both Poet saves and Plume from fading .</l>

    <head>REPORT OF AN ADJUDGED CASE ,</head>
    <head>NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY OF THE BOOKS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose ,</l>
     <l n="2">The spectacles set them unhappily wrong ;</l>
     <l n="3">The point in dispute was , as all the world knows ,</l>
     <l n="4">To which the said spectacles ought to belong .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="5">So Tongue was the lawyer , and argued the cause</l>
     <l n="6">With a great deal of skill , and a wig full of learning ;</l>
     <l n="7">While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws ,</l>
     <l n="8">So famed for his talent in nicely discerning .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="9">In behalf of the Nose it will quickly appear ,</l>
     <l n="10">And your lordship , he said , will undoubtedly find ,</l>
     <l n="11">That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear ,</l>
     <l n="12">Which amounts to possession time out of mind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="13">Then holding the spectacles up to the court —</l>
     <l n="14">Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle ,</l>
     <l n="15">As wide as the ridge of the Nose is ; in short ,</l>
     <l n="16">Design 'd to sit close to it , just like a saddle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="17">Again , would your lordship a moment suppose</l>
     <l n="18">( ‘ Tis a case that has happen 'd , and may be again )</l>
     <l n="19">That the visage or countenance had not a Nose ,</l>
     <l n="20">Pray who would , or who could , wear spectacles then ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="21">On the whole it appears , and my argument shows ,</l>
     <l n="22">With a reasoning the court will never condemn ,</l>
     <l n="23">That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose ,</l>
     <l n="24">And the Nose was as plainly intended for them .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="25">Then shifting his side , ( as a lawyer knows how ,)</l>
     <l n="26">He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes :</l>
     <l n="27">But what were his arguments few people know ,</l>
     <l n="28">For the court did not think they were equally wise .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="29">So his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone ,</l>
     <l n="30">Decisive and clear , without one if or but —</l>
     <l n="31">That , whenever the Nose put his spectacles on ,</l>
     <l n="32">By daylight or candlelight — Eyes should be shut !</l>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 821 ]</span>It may be proper to inform the reader , that this piece has already appeared in print , having found its way , though with some unnecessary additions by an unknown hand , into the Leeds Journal , without the author 's privity .</head>
     <l n="1">Thus says the prophet of the Turk ,</l>
     <l n="2">Good Mussulman , abstain from pork ;</l>
     <l n="3">There is a part in every swine</l>
     <l n="4">No friend or follower of mine</l>
     <l n="5">May taste , whate'er his inclination ,</l>
     <l n="6">On pain of excommunication .</l>
     <l n="7">Such Mahomet 's mysterious charge ,</l>
     <l n="8">And thus he left the point at large .</l>
     <l n="9">Had he the sinful part express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">They might with safety eat the rest ;</l>
     <l n="11">But for one piece they thought it hard</l>
     <l n="12">From the whole hog to be debarr 'd ;</l>
     <l n="13">And set their wit at work to find</l>
     <l n="14">What joint the prophet had in mind .</l>
     <l n="15">Much controversy straight arose ,</l>
     <l n="16">These choose the back , the belly those ;</l>
     <l n="17">By some ‘ tis confidently said</l>
     <l n="18">He meant not to forbid the head ;</l>
     <l n="19">While others at that doctrine rail ,</l>
     <l n="20">And piously prefer the tail .</l>
     <l n="21">Thus , conscience freed from every clog ,</l>
     <l n="22">Mahometans eat up the hog .</l>
     <l n="23">You laugh — ‘ tis well — the tale applied</l>
     <l n="24">May make you laugh on t'other side .</l>
     <l n="25">Renounce the world — the preacher cries .</l>
     <l n="26">We do — a multitude replies .</l>
     <l n="27">While one as innocent regards</l>
     <l n="28">A snug and friendly game at cards ;</l>
     <l n="29">And one , whatever you may say ,</l>
     <l n="30">Can see no evil in a play ;</l>
     <l n="31">Some love a concert , or a race ;</l>
     <l n="32">And others shooting , and the chase .</l>
     <l n="33">Reviled and loved , renounced and follow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="34">Thus , bit by bit , the world is swallow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="35">Each thinks his neighbour makes too free ,</l>
     <l n="36">Yet likes a slice as well as he :</l>
     <l n="37">With sophistry their sauce they sweeten ,</l>
     <l n="38">Till quite from tail to snout ‘ tis eaten .</l>

     <l n="12">In many an orchard , copse , and grove ,</l>
     <l n="13">Assembled on affairs of love ,</l>
     <l n="14">And with much twitter and much chatter</l>
     <l n="15">Began to agitate the matter .</l>
     <l n="16">At length a Bullfinch , who could boast</l>
     <l n="17">More years and wisdom than the most ,</l>
     <l n="18">Entreated , opening wide his beak ,</l>
     <l n="19">A moment 's liberty to speak ;</l>

     <l n="41">Their sentiments so well express 'd</l>
     <l n="42">Influenced mightily the rest ,</l>
     <l n="43">All pair 'd , and each pair built a nest .</l>
     <l n="44">But , though the birds were thus in haste ,</l>
     <l n="45">The leaves came on not quite so fast ,</l>
     <l n="46">And destiny , that sometimes bears</l>
     <l n="47">An aspect stern on man 's affairs ,</l>
     <l n="48">Not altogether smiled on theirs .</l>
     <l n="49">The wind , of late breathed gently forth ,</l>
     <l n="50">Now shifted east , and east by north ;</l>
     <l n="51">Bare trees and shrubs but ill , you know ,</l>
     <l n="52">Could shelter them from rain or snow ,</l>
     <l n="53">Stepping into their nests , they paddled ,</l>
     <l n="54">Themselves were chill 'd , their eggs were addled ;</l>
     <l n="55">Soon every father bird and mother</l>
     <l n="56">Grew quarrelsome , and peck 'd each other ,</l>
     <l n="57">Parted without the least regret ,</l>
     <l n="58">Except that they had ever met ,</l>
     <l n="59">And learn 'd in future to be wiser ,</l>

     <l n="1">An Oyster , cast upon the shore ,</l>
     <l n="2">Was heard , though never heard before ,</l>
     <l n="3">Complaining in a speech well worded ,</l>
     <l n="4">And worthy thus to be recorded :—</l>

     <l n="9">But toss 'd and buffeted about ,</l>
     <l n="10">Now in the water and now out .</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Twere better to be born a stone ,</l>
     <l n="12">Of ruder shape , and feeling none ,</l>

     <l n="14">And sensibilities so fine !</l>
     <l n="15">I envy that unfeeling shrub ,</l>
     <l n="16">Fast rooted against every rub .</l>
     <l n="17">The plant he meant grew not far off ,</l>
     <l n="18">And felt the sneer with scorn enough :</l>
     <l n="19">Was hurt , disgusted , mortified ,</l>
     <l n="20">And with asperity replied :</l>

     <l n="36">Says — Well , tis more than one would think !</l>

     <l n="53">Wherever driven by wind or tide ,</l>
     <l n="54">Exempt from every ill beside .</l>
     <l n="55">And as for you , my Lady Squeamish ,</l>
     <l n="56">Who reckon every touch a blemish ,</l>
     <l n="57">If all the plants , that can be found</l>
     <l n="58">Embellishing the scene around ,</l>
     <l n="59">Should droop and wither where they grow ,</l>
     <l n="60">You would not feel at all — not you .</l>
     <l n="61">The noblest minds their virtue prove</l>
     <l n="62">By pity , sympathy , and love :</l>
     <l n="63">These , these are feelings truly fine ,</l>
     <l n="64">And prove their owner half divine .</l>
     <l n="65">His censure reach 'd them as he dealt it</l>
     <l n="66">And each by shrinking show 'd he felt it .</l>

    <head>THE NIGHTINGALE AND GLOWWORM .</head>

     <l n="2">Had cheer 'd the village with his song ,</l>
     <l n="3">Nor yet at eve his note suspended ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor yet when eventide was ended ,</l>
     <l n="5">Began to feel , as well he might ,</l>
     <l n="6">The keen demands of appetite ;</l>
     <l n="7">When , looking eagerly around</l>
     <l n="8">He spied far off , upon the ground ,</l>
     <l n="9">A something shining in the dark ,</l>
     <l n="10">And knew the glowworm by his spark ;</l>
     <l n="11">So stooping down from hawthorn top ,</l>
     <l n="12">He thought to put him in his crop .</l>
     <l n="13">The worm , aware of his intent ,</l>
     <l n="14">Harangued him thus , right eloquent —</l>

     <l n="16">As much as I your minstrelsy ,</l>
     <l n="17">You would abhor to do me wrong</l>
     <l n="18">As much as I to spoil your song ;</l>

     <l n="27">Hence jarring sectaries may learn</l>
     <l n="28">Their real interest to discern ;</l>
     <l n="29">That brother should not war with brother ,</l>
     <l n="30">And worry and devour each other ;</l>
     <l n="31">But sing and shine by sweet consent ,</l>
     <l n="32">Till life 's poor transient night is spent ,</l>
     <l n="33">Respecting in each other 's case</l>
     <l n="34">The gifts of nature and of grace .</l>

     <l n="5">From man to man , or e'en to woman paid ,</l>

     <l n="7">A coin by craft for folly 's use design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="8">Spurious , and only current with the blind .</l>
     <l n="9">The path of sorrow , and that path alone ,</l>
     <l n="10">Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown ;</l>
     <l n="11">No traveller ever reach 'd that blest abode ,</l>

     <l n="17">Admonish 'd , scorn the caution and the friend ,</l>
     <l n="18">Bent all on pleasure , heedless of its end .</l>
     <l n="19">But He , who knew what human hearts would prove ,</l>

     <l n="21">That , hard by nature and of stubborn will ,</l>

     <l n="25">Call 'd for a cloud to darken all their years ,</l>
     <l n="26">And said , “ Go , spend them in the vale of tears . ”</l>
     <l n="27">O balmy gales of soul-reviving air !</l>
     <l n="28">O salutary streams , that murmur there !</l>
     <l n="29">These flowing from the fount of grace above ,</l>
     <l n="30">Those breathed from lips of everlasting love .</l>
     <l n="31">The flinty soil indeed their feet annoys ;</l>
     <l n="32">Chill blasts of trouble nip their springing joys ;</l>
     <l n="33">An envious world will interpose its frown ,</l>
     <l n="34">To mar delights superior to its own ;</l>
     <l n="35">And many a pang , experienced still within ,</l>
     <l n="36">Reminds them of their hated inmate , Sin :</l>
     <l n="37">But ills of every shape and every name ,</l>
     <l n="38">Transform 'd to blessings , miss their cruel aim :</l>
     <l n="39">And every moment 's calm , that soothes the breast ,</l>
     <l n="40">Is given in earnest of eternal rest .</l>
     <l n="41">Ah , be not sad , although thy lot be cast</l>
     <l n="42">Far from the flock , and in a boundless waste !</l>
     <l n="43">No shepherd 's tents within thy view appear ,</l>
     <l n="44">But the chief Shepherd even there is near ;</l>
     <l n="45">Thy tender sorrows and thy plaintive strain</l>
     <l n="46">Flow in a foreign land , but not in vain ;</l>
     <l n="47">Thy tears all issue from a source divine ,</l>
     <l n="48">And every drop bespeaks a Saviour thine —</l>
     <l n="49">So once in Gideon 's fleece the dews were found ,</l>

     <l n="8">Within its customary nook ,</l>
     <l n="9">And , staff in hand , set forth to share</l>
     <l n="10">The sober cordial of sweet air ,</l>
     <l n="11">Like Isaac , with a mind applied</l>
     <l n="12">To serious thought at evening-tide .</l>
     <l n="13">Autumnal rains had made it chill ,</l>

     <l n="27">His object chosen , wealth or fame ,</l>

    <head>THE NEEDLESS ALARM .</head>
    <head>A TALE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">There is a field , through which I often pass ,</l>
     <l n="2">Thick overspread with moss and silky grass ,</l>
     <l n="3">Adjoining close to Kilwick 's echoing wood ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where oft the bitch-fox hides her hapless brood ,</l>
     <l n="5">Reserved to solace many a neighbouring squire ,</l>
     <l n="6">That he may follow them through brake and brier ,</l>
     <l n="7">Contusion hazarding of neck , or spine ,</l>
     <l n="8">Which rural gentlemen call sport divine .</l>
     <l n="9">A narrow brook , by rushy banks conceal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="10">Runs in a bottom , and divides the field ;</l>
     <l n="11">Oaks intersperse it , that had once a head ,</l>
     <l n="12">But now wear crests of oven-wood instead ;</l>
     <l n="13">And where the land slopes to its watery bourn</l>
     <l n="14">Wide yawns a gulf beside a ragged thorn ;</l>
     <l n="15">Bricks line the sides , but shiver 'd long ago ,</l>
     <l n="16">And horrid brambles intertwine below ;</l>
     <l n="17">A hollow scoop 'd , I judge , in ancient time ,</l>
     <l n="18">For baking earth , or burning rock to lime .</l>
     <l n="19">Not yet the hawthorn bore her berries red ,</l>
     <l n="20">With which the fieldfare , wintry guest , is fed ;</l>
     <l n="21">Nor Autumn yet had brush 'd from every spray ,</l>
     <l n="22">With her chill hand , the mellow leaves away ;</l>
     <l n="23">But corn was housed , and beans were in the stack ,</l>
     <l n="24">Now therefore issued forth the spotted pack ,</l>
     <l n="25">With tails high mounted , ears hung low , and throats</l>
     <l n="26">With a whole gamut fill 'd of heavenly notes ,</l>
     <l n="27">For which , alas ! my destiny severe ,</l>
     <l n="28">Though ears she gave me two , gave me no ear .</l>
     <l n="29">The sun , accomplishing his early march ,</l>
     <l n="30">His lamp now planted on heaven 's topmost arch ,</l>
     <l n="31">When , exercise and air my only aim ,</l>
     <l n="32">And heedless whither , to that field I came ,</l>
     <l n="33">Ere yet with ruthless joy the happy hound</l>
     <l n="34">Told hill and dale that Reynard 's track was found ,</l>
     <l n="35">Or with the high-raised horn 's melodious clang</l>
     <l n="36">All Kilwick<span type="note_anchor">[ 824 ]</span>and all Dinglederry<span type="note_anchor">[ 824 ]</span>rang .</l>
     <l n="37">Sheep grazed the field ; some with soft bosom press 'd</l>
     <l n="38">The herb as soft , while nibbling stray 'd the rest ;</l>
     <l n="39">Nor noise was heard but of the hasty brook ,</l>
     <l n="40">Struggling , detain 'd in many a petty nook .</l>
     <l n="41">All seem 'd so peaceful , that , from them convey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">To me their peace by kind contagion spread .</l>
     <l n="43">But when the huntsman , with distended cheek ,</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Gan make his instrument of music speak ,</l>
     <l n="45">And from within the wood that crash was heard ,</l>
     <l n="46">Though not a hound from whom it burst appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="47">The sheep recumbent and the sheep that grazed ,</l>
     <l n="48">All huddling into phalanx , stood and gazed ,</l>
     <l n="49">Admiring , terrified , the novel strain ,</l>
     <l n="50">Then coursed the field around , and coursed it round again ;</l>
     <l n="51">But recollecting , with a sudden thought ,</l>
     <l n="52">That flight in circles urged advanced them nought ,</l>
     <l n="53">They gathered close around the old pit 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="54">And thought again — but knew not what to think .</l>
     <l n="55">The man to solitude accustom 'd long ,</l>
     <l n="56">Perceives in every thing that lives a tongue ;</l>
     <l n="57">Not animals alone , but shrubs and trees</l>
     <l n="58">Have speech for him , and understood with ease ;</l>
     <l n="59">After long drought , when rains abundant fall ,</l>
     <l n="60">He hears the herbs and flowers rejoicing all ;</l>
     <l n="61">Knows what the freshness of their hue implies ,</l>
     <l n="62">How glad they catch the largess of the skies ;</l>
     <l n="63">But , with precision nicer still , the mind</l>
     <l n="64">He scans of every locomotive kind ;</l>
     <l n="65">Birds of all feather , beasts of every name ;</l>
     <l n="66">That serve mankind , or shun them , wild or tame ;</l>
     <l n="67">The looks and gestures of their griefs and fears</l>
     <l n="68">Have all articulation in his ears ;</l>
     <l n="69">He spells them true by intuition 's light ,</l>
     <l n="70">And needs no glossary to set him right .</l>
     <l n="71">This truth premised was needful as a text ,</l>
     <l n="72">To win due credence to what follows next .</l>
     <l n="73">Awhile they mused ; surveying every face ,</l>
     <l n="74">Thou hadst supposed them of superior race ;</l>
     <l n="75">Their periwigs of wool and fears combined ,</l>
     <l n="76">Stamp 'd on each countenance such marks of mind ,</l>
     <l n="77">That sage they seem 'd , as lawyers o'er a doubt ,</l>
     <l n="78">Which , puzzling long , at last they puzzle out ;</l>
     <l n="79">Or academic tutors , teaching youths ,</l>
     <l n="80">Sure ne'er to want them , mathematic truths ;</l>
     <l n="81">When thus a mutton statelier than the rest ,</l>
     <l n="82">A ram , the ewes and wethers sad address 'd .</l>
     <l n="83">Friends ! we have lived too long . I never heard</l>
     <l n="84">Sounds such as these , so worthy to be fear 'd .</l>
     <l n="85">Could I believe , that winds for ages pent</l>
     <l n="86">In earth 's dark womb have found at last a vent ,</l>
     <l n="87">And from their prison-house below arise ,</l>
     <l n="88">With all these hideous howlings to the skies ,</l>
     <l n="89">I could be much composed , nor should appear ,</l>
     <l n="90">For such a cause to feel the slightest fear .</l>
     <l n="91">Yourselves have seen , what time the thunders roll 'd</l>
     <l n="92">All night , me resting quiet in the fold .</l>
     <l n="93">Or heard we that tremendous bray alone ,</l>
     <l n="94">I could expound the melancholy tone ;</l>
     <l n="95">Should deem it by our old companion made ,</l>
     <l n="96">The ass ; for he , we know , has lately stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="97">And , being lost , perhaps , and wandering wide ,</l>
     <l n="98">Might be supposed to clamour for a guide .</l>
     <l n="99">But ah ! those dreadful yells what soul can hear ,</l>
     <l n="100">That owns a carcass , and not quake for fear ?</l>
     <l n="101">Demons produce them doubtless , brazen-claw 'd</l>
     <l n="102">And fang 'd with brass the demons are abroad ;</l>
     <l n="103">I hold it therefore wisest and most fit</l>
     <l n="104">That , life to save , we leap into the pit .</l>
     <l n="105">Him answer 'd then his loving mate and true ,</l>
     <l n="106">But more discreet than he , a Cambrian ewe .</l>
     <l n="107">How ! leap into the pit our life to save ?</l>
     <l n="108">To save our life leap all into the grave ?</l>
     <l n="109">For can we find it less ? Contemplate first</l>
     <l n="110">The depth how awful ! falling there , we burst :</l>
     <l n="111">Or should the brambles , interposed , our fall</l>
     <l n="112">In part abate , that happiness were small ;</l>
     <l n="113">For with a race like theirs no chance I see</l>
     <l n="114">Of peace or ease to creatures clad as we .</l>
     <l n="115">Meantime , noise kills not . Be it Dapple 's bray ,</l>
     <l n="116">Or be it not , or be it whose it may ,</l>
     <l n="117">And rush those other sounds , that seem by tongues</l>
     <l n="118">Of demons utter 'd , from whatever lungs ,</l>
     <l n="119">Sounds are but sounds , and , till the cause appear ,</l>
     <l n="120">We have at least commodious standing here .</l>
     <l n="121">Come fiend , come fury , giant , monster , blast</l>
     <l n="122">From earth or hell , we can but plunge at last .</l>
     <l n="123">While thus she spake , I fainter heard the peals ,</l>
     <l n="124">For Reynard , close attended at his heels</l>
     <l n="125">By panting dog , tired man , and spatter 'd horse ,</l>
     <l n="126">Through mere good fortune , took a different course .</l>
     <l n="127">The flock grew calm again , and I , the road</l>
     <l n="128">Following , that led me to my own abode ,</l>

    <head>HEROISM .</head>
     <l n="1">There was a time when Ætna 's silent fire</l>
     <l n="2">Slept unperceiv 'd , the mountain yet entire ;</l>
     <l n="3">When , conscious of no danger from below ,</l>
     <l n="4">She tower 'd a cloud-capt pyramid of snow .</l>
     <l n="5">No thunders shook with deep intestine sound</l>
     <l n="6">The blooming groves that girdled her around .</l>
     <l n="7">Her unctuous olives , and her purple vines</l>
     <l n="8">( Unfelt the fury of those bursting mines )</l>
     <l n="9">The peasant 's hopes , and not in vain , assured ,</l>
     <l n="10">In peace upon her sloping sides matured .</l>
     <l n="11">When on a day , like that of the last doom ,</l>
     <l n="12">A conflagration labouring in her womb ,</l>
     <l n="13">She teem 'd and heaved with an infernal birth ,</l>
     <l n="14">That shook the circling seas and solid earth .</l>
     <l n="15">Dark and voluminous the vapours rise ,</l>
     <l n="16">And hang their horrors in the neighbouring skies ,</l>
     <l n="17">While through the Stygian veil , that blots the day ,</l>
     <l n="18">In dazzling streaks the vivid lightnings play .</l>
     <l n="19">But oh ! what muse , and in what powers of song ,</l>
     <l n="20">Can trace the torrent as it burns along ?</l>
     <l n="21">Havoc and devastation in the van ,</l>
     <l n="22">It marches o'er the prostrate works of man ;</l>
     <l n="23">Vines , olives , herbage , forests disappear ,</l>
     <l n="24">And all the charms of a Sicilian year .</l>
     <l n="25">Revolving seasons , fruitless as they pass ,</l>
     <l n="26">See it an uninformed and idle mass ;</l>
     <l n="27">Without a soil to invite the tiller 's care ,</l>
     <l n="28">Or blade that might redeem it from despair .</l>
     <l n="29">Yet time at length ( what will not time achieve ? )</l>
     <l n="30">Clothes it with earth , and bids the produce live .</l>
     <l n="31">Once more the spiry myrtle crowns the glade ,</l>
     <l n="32">And ruminating flocks enjoy the shade .</l>
     <l n="33">O bliss precarious , and unsafe retreats ,</l>
     <l n="34">O charming Paradise of shortlived sweets !</l>
     <l n="35">The self-same gale that wafts the fragrance round</l>
     <l n="36">Brings to the distant ear a sullen sound :</l>
     <l n="37">Again the mountain feels the imprison 'd foe ,</l>
     <l n="38">Again pours ruin on the vale below .</l>
     <l n="39">Ten thousand swains the wasted scene deplore ,</l>
     <l n="40">That only future ages can restore .</l>
     <l n="41">Ye monarchs , whom the lure of honour draws ,</l>
     <l n="42">Who write in blood the merits of your cause ,</l>
     <l n="43">Who strike the blow , then plead your own defence ,</l>
     <l n="44">Glory your aim , but justice your pretence ;</l>
     <l n="45">Behold in Ætna 's emblematic fires</l>
     <l n="46">The mischiefs your ambitious pride inspires !</l>
     <l n="47">Fast by the stream that bounds your just domain ,</l>
     <l n="48">And tells you where you have a right to reign ,</l>
     <l n="49">A nation dwells , not envious of your throne ,</l>
     <l n="50">Studious of peace , their neighbour 's and their own ,</l>
     <l n="51">Ill-fated race ! how deeply must they rue</l>
     <l n="52">Their only crime , vicinity to you !</l>
     <l n="53">The trumpet sounds , your legions swarm abroad ,</l>
     <l n="54">Through the ripe harvest lies their destined road ;</l>
     <l n="55">At every step beneath their feet they tread</l>
     <l n="56">The life of multitudes , a nation 's bread !</l>
     <l n="57">Earth seems a garden in its loveliest dress</l>
     <l n="58">Before them , and behind a wilderness .</l>
     <l n="59">Famine , and Pestilence , her firstborn son ,</l>
     <l n="60">Attend to finish what the sword begun ;</l>
     <l n="61">And echoing praises , such as fiends might earn ,</l>
     <l n="62">And folly pays , resound at your return .</l>
     <l n="63">A calm succeeds — but Plenty , with her train</l>
     <l n="64">Of heartfelt joys , succeeds not soon again :</l>
     <l n="65">And years of pining indigence must show</l>
     <l n="66">What scourges are the gods that rule below .</l>
     <l n="67">Yet man , laborious man , by slow degrees ,</l>
     <l n="68">( Such is his thirst of opulence and ease ,)</l>
     <l n="69">Plies all the sinews of industrious toil ,</l>
     <l n="70">Gleans up the refuse of the general spoil ,</l>
     <l n="71">Rebuilds the towers that smoked upon the plain ,</l>
     <l n="72">And the sun gilds the shining spires again .</l>
     <l n="73">Increasing commerce and reviving art</l>
     <l n="74">Renew the quarrel on the conqueror 's part ;</l>
     <l n="75">And the sad lesson must be learn 'd once more ,</l>
     <l n="76">That wealth within is ruin at the door .</l>
     <l n="77">What are ye , monarchs , laurell 'd heroes , say ,</l>
     <l n="78">But Ætnas of the suffering world ye sway ?</l>
     <l n="79">Sweet Nature , stripp 'd of her embroider 'd robe ,</l>
     <l n="80">Deplores the wasted regions of her globe ;</l>
     <l n="81">And stands a witness at Truth 's awful bar ,</l>
     <l n="82">To prove you there destroyers as ye are .</l>
     <l n="83">O place me in some heaven-protected isle ,</l>
     <l n="84">Where Peace , and Equity , and Freedom smile ;</l>
     <l n="85">Where no volcano pours his fiery flood ,</l>
     <l n="86">No crested warrior dips his plume in blood ;</l>
     <l n="87">Where Power secures what Industry has won ;</l>
     <l n="88">Where to succeed is not to be undone ;</l>
     <l n="89">A land that distant tyrants hate in vain ,</l>
     <l n="90">In Britain 's isle , beneath a George 's reign .</l>

   <p>ON THE RECEIPT OF MY MOTHER 'S PICTURE OUT OF NORFOLK ,</p>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>THE GIFT OF MY COUSIN , ANN BODHAM .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O that those lips had language ! Life has pass 'd</l>
     <l n="2">With me but roughly since I heard thee last .</l>
     <l n="3">Those lips are thine — thy own sweet smile I see ,</l>
     <l n="4">The same that oft in childhood solaced me ;</l>
     <l n="5">Voice only fails , else how distinct they say ,</l>
     <l n="6">“ Grieve not , my child , chase all thy fears away ! ”</l>
     <l n="7">The meek intelligence of those dear eyes</l>
     <l n="8">( Blest be the art that can immortalize ,</l>
     <l n="9">The art that baffles Time 's tyrannic claim</l>
     <l n="10">To quench it ) here shines on me still the same .</l>
     <l n="11">Faithful remembrancer of one so dear ,</l>
     <l n="12">O welcome guest , though unexpected here :</l>
     <l n="13">Who bidst me honour with an artless song ,</l>
     <l n="14">Affectionate , a mother lost so long .</l>
     <l n="15">I will obey , not willingly alone ,</l>
     <l n="16">But gladly , as the precept were her own :</l>
     <l n="17">And , while that face renews my filial grief ,</l>
     <l n="18">Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief ,</l>
     <l n="19">Shall steep me in Elysian reverie ,</l>
     <l n="20">A momentary dream , that thou art she .</l>
     <l n="21">My mother ! when I learn 'd that thou wast dead ,</l>
     <l n="22">Say , wast thou conscious of the tears I shed ?</l>
     <l n="23">Hover 'd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son ,</l>
     <l n="24">Wretch even then , life 's journey just begun ?</l>
     <l n="25">Perhaps thou gavest me , though unfelt , a kiss ;</l>
     <l n="26">Perhaps a tear , if souls can weep in bliss —</l>
     <l n="27">Ah , that maternal smile ! it answers — Yes .</l>
     <l n="28">I heard the bell toll 'd on thy burial day ,</l>
     <l n="29">I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away ,</l>
     <l n="30">And turning from my nursery window , drew</l>
     <l n="31">A long , long sigh , and wept a last adieu !</l>
     <l n="32">But was it such ?— It was .— Where thou art gone</l>
     <l n="33">Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown .</l>
     <l n="34">May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore ,</l>
     <l n="35">The parting word shall pass my lips no more !</l>
     <l n="36">Thy maidens , grieved themselves at my concern ,</l>
     <l n="37">Oft gave me promise of thy quick return .</l>
     <l n="38">What ardently I wish 'd , I long believed ,</l>
     <l n="39">And , disappointed still , was still deceived .</l>
     <l n="40">By expectation every day beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="41">Dupe of to-morrow even from a child .</l>
     <l n="42">Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went ,</l>
     <l n="43">Till , all my stock of infant sorrows spent ,</l>
     <l n="44">I learn 'd at last submission to my lot ,</l>
     <l n="45">But , though I less deplored thee , ne'er forgot .</l>
     <l n="46">Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more ,</l>
     <l n="47">Children not thine have trod my nursery floor ;</l>
     <l n="48">And where the gardener Robin , day by day ,</l>
     <l n="49">Drew me to school along the public way ,</l>
     <l n="50">Delighted with my bauble coach , and wrapp 'd</l>
     <l n="51">In scarlet mantle warm , and velvet capp 'd ,</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Tis now become a history little known ,</l>
     <l n="53">That once we call 'd the pastoral house our own .</l>
     <l n="54">Short-lived possession ! but the record fair ,</l>
     <l n="55">That memory keeps of all thy kindness there ,</l>
     <l n="56">Still outlives many a storm , that has effaced</l>
     <l n="57">A thousand other themes less deeply traced .</l>
     <l n="58">Thy nightly visits to my chamber made ,</l>
     <l n="59">That thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid ;</l>
     <l n="60">Thy morning bounties ere I left my home ,</l>
     <l n="61">The biscuit or confectionary plum ;</l>
     <l n="62">The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestow 'd</l>
     <l n="63">By thy own hand , till fresh they shone and glow 'd :</l>
     <l n="64">All this , and more endearing still than all ,</l>
     <l n="65">Thy constant flow of love that knew no fall ,</l>
     <l n="66">Ne'er roughen 'd by those cataracts and breaks</l>
     <l n="67">That humour interposed too often makes ;</l>
     <l n="68">All this still legible in memory 's page ,</l>
     <l n="69">And still to be so to my latest age ,</l>
     <l n="70">Adds joy to duty , makes me glad to pay</l>
     <l n="71">Such honours to thee as my numbers may ;</l>
     <l n="72">Perhaps a frail memorial , but sincere ,</l>
     <l n="73">Not scorn 'd in heaven , though little noticed here .</l>
     <l n="74">Could Time , his flight reversed , restore the hours ,</l>
     <l n="75">When , playing with thy vesture 's tissued flowers ,</l>
     <l n="76">The violet , the pink , and jessamine ,</l>
     <l n="77">I prick 'd them into paper with a pin ,</l>
     <l n="78">( And thou wast happier than myself the while ,</l>
     <l n="79">Wouldst softly speak , and stroke my head , and smile ,)</l>
     <l n="80">Could those few pleasant days again appear ,</l>
     <l n="81">Might one wish bring them , would I wish them here ?</l>
     <l n="82">I would not trust my heart — the dear delight</l>
     <l n="83">Seems so to be desired , perhaps I might .—</l>
     <l n="84">But no — what here we call our life is such ,</l>
     <l n="85">So little to be loved , and thou so much ,</l>
     <l n="86">That I should ill requite thee to constrain</l>
     <l n="87">Thy unbound spirit into bonds again .</l>
     <l n="88">Thou , as a gallant bark from Albion 's coast</l>
     <l n="89">( The storms all weather 'd and the ocean cross 'd )</l>
     <l n="90">Shoots into port at some well-haven 'd isle</l>
     <l n="91">Where spices breathe , and brighter seasons smile ,</l>
     <l n="92">There sits quiescent on the floods , that show</l>
     <l n="93">Her beauteous form reflected clear below ,</l>
     <l n="94">While airs impregnated with incense play</l>
     <l n="95">Around her , fanning light her streamers gay :</l>
     <l n="96">So thou , with sails how swift ! hast reach 'd the shore ,</l>
     <l n="97">“ Where tempests never beat nor billows roar ;"[ 825 ]</l>
     <l n="98">And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide</l>
     <l n="99">Of life long since has anchor 'd by thy side .</l>
     <l n="100">But me , scarce hoping to attain that rest ,</l>
     <l n="101">Always from port withheld , always distress 'd —</l>
     <l n="102">Me howling blasts drive devious , tempest-toss 'd</l>
     <l n="103">Sails ripp 'd , seams opening wide , and compass lost ,</l>
     <l n="104">And day by day some current 's thwarting force</l>
     <l n="105">Sets me more distant from a prosperous course .</l>
     <l n="106">But oh , the thought , that thou art safe , and he !</l>
     <l n="107">That thought is joy , arrive what may to me .</l>
     <l n="108">My boast is not that I deduce my birth</l>
     <l n="109">From loins enthroned , and rulers of the earth ;</l>
     <l n="110">But higher far my proud pretensions rise —</l>
     <l n="111">The son of parents pass 'd into the skies .</l>
     <l n="112">And now , farewell — Time unrevoked has run</l>
     <l n="113">His wonted course , yet what I wish 'd is done .</l>
     <l n="114">By contemplation 's help , not sought in vain ,</l>
     <l n="115">I seem to have lived my childhood o'er again ;</l>
     <l n="116">To have renew 'd the joys that once were mine ,</l>
     <l n="117">Without the sin of violating thine ;</l>
     <l n="118">And , while the wings of fancy still are free ,</l>
     <l n="119">And I can view this mimic show of thee ,</l>
     <l n="120">Time has but half succeeded in his theft —</l>
     <l n="121">Thyself removed , thy power to soothe me left .</l>

    <head>ANNUS MEMORABILIS , 1789 .</head>
    <head>WRITTEN IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS MAJESTY 'S HAPPY RECOVERY .</head>
     <l n="1">I ransack 'd for a theme of song ,</l>
     <l n="2">Much ancient chronicle , and long ;</l>
     <l n="3">I read of bright embattled fields ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of trophied helmets , spears , and shields ,</l>
     <l n="5">Of chiefs , whose single arm could boast</l>
     <l n="6">Prowess to dissipate a host ;</l>
     <l n="7">Through tomes of fable and of dream</l>
     <l n="8">I sought an eligible theme ,</l>
     <l n="9">But none I found , or found them shared</l>
     <l n="10">Already by some happier bard .</l>
     <l n="11">To modern times , with truth to guide</l>
     <l n="12">My busy search , I next applied ;</l>
     <l n="13">Here cities won , and fleets dispersed ,</l>
     <l n="14">Urged loud a claim to be rehearsed ,</l>
     <l n="15">Deeds of unperishing renown ,</l>
     <l n="16">Our fathers ’ triumphs and our own .</l>
     <l n="17">Thus as the bee , from bank to bower ,</l>
     <l n="18">Assiduous sips at every flower ,</l>
     <l n="19">But rests on none till that be found</l>
     <l n="20">Where most nectareous sweets abound ,</l>
     <l n="21">So I , from theme to theme display 'd</l>
     <l n="22">In many a page historic , stray 'd ,</l>
     <l n="23">Siege after siege , fight after fight ,</l>
     <l n="24">Contemplating with small delight ,</l>
     <l n="25">( For feats of sanguinary hue</l>
     <l n="26">Not always glitter in my view ,)</l>

     <l n="38">With loss of what she least could spare ,</l>
     <l n="39">Her sovereign 's tutelary care ,</l>
     <l n="40">One breath of heaven , that cried — Restore !</l>
     <l n="41">Chased , never to assemble more :</l>

     <l n="56">O Queen of Albion , queen of isles !</l>
     <l n="57">Since all thy tears were changed to smiles ,</l>
     <l n="58">The eyes , that never saw thee , shine</l>
     <l n="59">With joy not unallied to thine ;</l>
     <l n="60">Transports not chargeable with art</l>
     <l n="61">Illume the land 's remotest part ,</l>

     <l n="63">Both in their toils and at their sports ,</l>
     <l n="64">The happiness of answer 'd prayers ,</l>
     <l n="65">That gilds thy features , show in theirs .</l>
     <l n="66">If they who on thy state attend ,</l>
     <l n="67">Awe-struck , before thy presence bend ,</l>

     <l n="4">A treasure in her way ; for neither meed</l>
     <l n="5">Of early breakfast , to dispel the fumes ,</l>
     <l n="6">And bowel-racking pains of emptiness ,</l>
     <l n="7">Nor noontide feast , nor evening 's cool repast ,</l>

     <l n="16">Enough !— thy blindness shall excuse the deed .</l>
     <l n="17">Nor does my muse no benefit exhale</l>
     <l n="18">From this thy scant indulgence !— even here</l>
     <l n="19">Hints worthy sage philosophy are found ;</l>
     <l n="20">Illustrious hints , to moralize my song !</l>
     <l n="21">This ponderous heel of perforated hide</l>
     <l n="22">Compact , with pegs indented , many a row ,</l>
     <l n="23">Haply ( for such its massy form bespeaks )</l>
     <l n="24">The weighty tread of some rude peasant clown</l>
     <l n="25">Upbore : on this , supported oft , he stretch 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">With uncouth strides , along the furrow 'd glebe ,</l>
     <l n="27">Flattening the stubborn clod , till cruel time</l>
     <l n="28">( What will not cruel time ? ) on a wry step</l>
     <l n="29">Sever 'd the strict cohesion ; when , alas !</l>
     <l n="30">He , who could erst , with even , equal pace ,</l>
     <l n="31">Pursue his destined way with symmetry ,</l>
     <l n="32">And some proportion form 'd , now on one side</l>
     <l n="33">Curtail 'd and maim 'd , the sport of vagrant boys ,</l>
     <l n="34">Cursing his frail supporter , treacherous prop !</l>
     <l n="35">With toilsome steps , and difficult , moves on .</l>
     <l n="36">Thus fares it oft with other than the feet</l>
     <l n="37">Of humble villager — the statesman thus ,</l>
     <l n="38">Up the steep road where proud ambition leads ,</l>
     <l n="39">Aspiring , first uninterrupted winds</l>
     <l n="40">His prosperous way ; nor fears miscarriage foul ,</l>
     <l n="41">While policy prevails , and friends prove true ;</l>
     <l n="42">But , that support soon failing , by him left</l>
     <l n="43">On whom he most depended , basely left ,</l>
     <l n="44">Betray 'd , deserted ; from his airy height</l>
     <l n="45">Headlong he falls ; and through the rest of life</l>
     <l n="46">Drags the dull load of disappointment on .</l>

     <l n="1">‘ Tis not that I design to rob</l>
     <l n="2">Thee of thy birthright , gentle Bob ,</l>
     <l n="3">For thou art born sole heir , and single ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of dear Mat Prior 's easy jingle ;</l>
     <l n="5">Not that I mean , while thus I knit</l>
     <l n="6">My threadbare sentiments together ,</l>
     <l n="7">To show my genius or my wit ,</l>
     <l n="8">When God and you know I have neither ;</l>
     <l n="9">Or such as might be better shown</l>
     <l n="10">By letting poetry alone .</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Tis not with either of these views</l>
     <l n="12">That I presumed to address the muse :</l>
     <l n="13">But to divert a fierce banditti ,</l>
     <l n="14">( Sworn foes to every thing that 's witty ! )</l>
     <l n="15">That , with a black , infernal train ,</l>
     <l n="16">Make cruel inroads in my brain ,</l>
     <l n="17">And daily threaten to drive thence</l>
     <l n="18">My little garrison of sense ;</l>
     <l n="19">The fierce banditti which I mean</l>
     <l n="20">Are gloomy thoughts led on by spleen .</l>
     <l n="21">Then there 's another reason yet ,</l>
     <l n="22">Which is , that I may fairly quit</l>
     <l n="23">The debt , which justly became due</l>
     <l n="24">The moment when I heard from you ;</l>
     <l n="25">And you might grumble , crony mine ,</l>
     <l n="26">If paid in any other coin ;</l>

     <l n="36">A thought — I have it — let me see —</l>
     <l n="37">‘ Tis gone again — plague o n't ! I thought</l>
     <l n="38">I had it — but I have it not .</l>
     <l n="39">Dame Gurton thus , and Hodge her son ,</l>
     <l n="40">That useful thing , her needle , gone !</l>
     <l n="41">Rake well the cinders — sweep the floor ,</l>
     <l n="42">And sift the dust behind the door ;</l>
     <l n="43">While eager Hodge beholds the prize</l>
     <l n="44">In old grimalkin 's glaring eyes ;</l>
     <l n="45">And Gammer finds it , on her knees ,</l>
     <l n="46">In every shining straw she sees .</l>
     <l n="47">This simile were apt enough ;</l>
     <l n="48">But I 've another , critic-proof !</l>
     <l n="49">The virtuoso thus , at noon ,</l>
     <l n="50">Broiling beneath a July sun ,</l>
     <l n="51">The gilded butterfly pursues ,</l>
     <l n="52">O'er hedge and ditch , through gaps and mews ;</l>
     <l n="53">And , after many a vain essay ,</l>
     <l n="54">To captivate the tempting prey ,</l>
     <l n="55">Gives him at length the lucky pat ,</l>
     <l n="56">And has him safe beneath his hat :</l>
     <l n="57">Then lifts it gently from the ground ;</l>
     <l n="58">But , ah ! ‘ tis lost as soon as found ;</l>
     <l n="59">Culprit his liberty regains ,</l>
     <l n="60">Flits out of sight , and mocks his pains .</l>
     <l n="61">The sense was dark ; ‘ twas therefore fit</l>
     <l n="62">With simile to illustrate it ;</l>
     <l n="63">But as too much obscures the sight ,</l>
     <l n="64">As often as too little light ,</l>
     <l n="65">We have our similes cut short ,</l>
     <l n="66">For matters of more grave import .</l>
     <l n="67">That Matthew 's numbers run with ease ,</l>
     <l n="68">Each man of common sense agrees !</l>
     <l n="69">All men of common sense allow</l>
     <l n="70">That Robert 's lines are easy too :</l>
     <l n="71">Where then the preference shall we place ,</l>
     <l n="72">Or how do justice in this case ?</l>
     <l n="73">Matthew ( says Fame ,) with endless pains</l>
     <l n="74">Smoothed and refined the meanest strains ;</l>
     <l n="75">Nor suffer 'd one ill chosen rhyme</l>
     <l n="76">To escape him at the idlest time ;</l>
     <l n="77">And thus o'er all a lustre cast ,</l>
     <l n="78">That , while the language lives shall last .</l>
     <l n="79">A'nt please your ladyship ( quoth I ,)</l>
     <l n="80">For ‘ tis my business to reply ;</l>

     <l n="85">Who throw their Helicon about</l>
     <l n="86">As freely as a conduit spout !</l>
     <l n="87">Friend Robert , thus like chien savant</l>

    <head>A TALE , FOUNDED ON A FACT ,</head>
    <head>WHICH HAPPENED IN JANUARY , 1779 .</head>
     <l n="1">Where Humber pours his rich commercial stream</l>
     <l n="2">There dwelt a wretch , who breathed but to blaspheme ;</l>
     <l n="3">In subterraneous caves his life he led ,</l>
     <l n="4">Black as the mine in which he wrought for bread .</l>
     <l n="5">When on a day , emerging from the deep ,</l>
     <l n="6">A sabbath-day , ( such sabbaths thousands keep ! )</l>
     <l n="7">The wages of his weekly toil he bore</l>
     <l n="8">To buy a cock — whose blood might win him more ;</l>
     <l n="9">As if the noblest of the feather 'd kind</l>
     <l n="10">Were but for battle and for death design 'd ;</l>
     <l n="11">As if the consecrated hours were meant</l>
     <l n="12">For sport , to minds on cruelty intent ;</l>
     <l n="13">It chanced ( such chances Providence obey )</l>
     <l n="14">He met a fellow labourer on the way ,</l>
     <l n="15">Whose heart the same desires had once inflamed ;</l>
     <l n="16">But now the savage temper was reclaim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="17">Persuasion on his lips had taken place ;</l>
     <l n="18">For all plead well who plead the cause of grace .</l>
     <l n="19">His iron heart with scripture he assail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="20">Woo 'd him to hear a sermon , and prevail 'd .</l>
     <l n="21">His faithful bow the mighty preacher drew ,</l>
     <l n="22">Swift as the lightning-glimpse the arrow flew .</l>
     <l n="23">He wept ; he trembled ; cast his eyes around ,</l>
     <l n="24">To find a worse than he ; but none he found .</l>
     <l n="25">He felt his sins , and wonder 'd he should feel .</l>
     <l n="26">Grace made the wound , and grace alone could heal .</l>
     <l n="27">Now farewell oaths , and blasphemies , and lies !</l>
     <l n="28">He quits the sinner 's for the martyr 's prize .</l>
     <l n="29">That holy day was wash 'd with many a tear ,</l>
     <l n="30">Gilded with hope , yet shaded too by fear .</l>
     <l n="31">The next , his swarthy brethren of the mine</l>
     <l n="32">Learn 'd , by his altered speech , the change divine !</l>
     <l n="33">Laugh 'd when they should have wept , and swore the day</l>
     <l n="34">Was nigh when he would swear as fast as they .</l>
     <l n="35">“ No , ” said the penitent , “ such words shall share</l>
     <l n="36">This breath no more ; devoted now to prayer .</l>
     <l n="37">O ! if Thou seest ( thine eye the future sees )</l>
     <l n="38">That I shall yet again blaspheme , like these ;</l>
     <l n="39">Now strike me to the ground on which I kneel ,</l>
     <l n="40">Ere yet this heart relapses into steel ;</l>
     <l n="41">Now take me to that heaven I once defied ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thy presence , thy embrace ! ” — He spoke , and died !</l>

     <l n="1">Close by the threshold of a door nail 'd fast</l>

     <l n="17">Her whisker 'd face , she ask 'd him , “ Who are you ? ”</l>
     <l n="18">On to the hall went I , with pace not slow ,</l>

     <l n="20">With which well arm 'd I hasten 'd to the spot ,</l>

     <l n="22">And , turning up the leaves and shrubs around ,</l>
     <l n="23">Found only that he was not be found .</l>
     <l n="24">But still the kittens , sitting as before ,</l>
     <l n="25">Sat watching close the bottom of the door .</l>
     <l n="26">“ I hope , ” said I , “ the villain I would kill</l>
     <l n="27">Has slipp 'd between the door and the door-sill ;</l>
     <l n="28">And if I make despatch , and follow hard ,</l>
     <l n="29">No doubt but I shall find him in the yard : ”</l>
     <l n="30">For long ere now it should have been rehearsed ,</l>
     <l n="31">‘ Twas in the garden that I found him first .</l>
     <l n="32">E'en there I found him , there the full-grown cat ,</l>
     <l n="33">His head , with velvet paw , did gently pat ;</l>
     <l n="34">As curious as the kittens erst had been</l>
     <l n="35">To learn what this phenomenon might mean .</l>
     <l n="36">Fill 'd with heroic ardour at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="37">And fearing every moment he would bite ,</l>
     <l n="38">And rob our household of our only cat</l>
     <l n="39">That was of age to combat with a rat ;</l>
     <l n="40">With outstretch 'd hoe I slew him at the door ,</l>

    <head>THE COCK-FIGHTER 'S GARLAND .<span type="note_anchor">[ 830 ]</span></head>
    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 830 ]</span>Written on reading the following in the obituary of the Gentleman 's Magazine for April , 1789 .— “ At Tottenham , John Ardesoif , Esq ., a young man of large fortune , and in the splendour of his carriages and horses rivalled by few country gentlemen . His table was that of hospitality , where , it may be said , he sacrificed too much to conviviality ; but , if he had his foibles he had his merits also , that far outweighed them . Mr. A. was very fond of cock-fighting , and had a favourite cock , upon which he had won many profitable matches . The last bet he laid upon this cock he lost ; which so enraged him , that he had the bird tied to a spit and roasted alive before a large fire . The screams of the miserable animal were so affecting , that some gentlemen who were present attempted to interfere , which so enraged Mr. A ., that he seized a poker , and with the most furious vehemence declared , that he would kill the first man who interposed ; but , in the midst of his passionate asseverations , he fell down dead upon the spot . Such , we are assured , were the circumstances which attended the death of this great pillar of humanity . ”</head>

    <head>THE RETIRED CAT .<span type="note_anchor">[ 831 ]</span></head>
    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 831 ]</span>Cowper 's partiality to animals is well known . Lady Hesketh , in one of her letters , states , “ that he had , at one time , five rabbits , three hares , two guinea-pigs , a magpie , a jay , and a starling ; besides two goldfinches , two canary birds , and two dogs . It is amazing how the three hares can find room to gambol and frolic ( as they certainly do ) in his small parlour ; ” and she adds , “ I forgot to enumerate a squirrel , which he had at the same time , and which used to play with one of the hares continually . One evening , the cat giving one of the hares a sound box on the ear , the hare ran after her , and , having caught her , punished her by drumming on her back with her two feet as hard as drum-sticks , till the creature would have actually been killed , had not Mrs. Unwin rescued her . ”</head>
     <l n="1">A poet 's cat , sedate and grave</l>
     <l n="2">As poet well could wish to have ,</l>
     <l n="3">Was much addicted to inquire</l>
     <l n="4">For nooks to which she might retire ,</l>
     <l n="5">And where , secure as mouse in chink ,</l>
     <l n="6">She might repose , or sit and think .</l>
     <l n="7">I know not where she caught the trick —</l>
     <l n="8">Nature perhaps herself had cast her</l>
     <l n="9">In such a mould philosophique ,</l>
     <l n="10">Or else she learn 'd it of her master .</l>
     <l n="11">Sometimes ascending , debonnair ,</l>
     <l n="12">An apple tree , or lofty pear ,</l>
     <l n="13">Lodged with convenience in the fork ,</l>
     <l n="14">She watch 'd the gardener at his work ;</l>
     <l n="15">Sometimes her ease and solace sought</l>
     <l n="16">In an old empty watering pot :</l>
     <l n="17">There , wanting nothing save a fan ,</l>
     <l n="18">To seem some nymph in her sedan</l>
     <l n="19">Apparell 'd in exactest sort ,</l>
     <l n="20">And ready to be borne to court .</l>
     <l n="21">But love of change , it seems , has place</l>
     <l n="22">Not only in our wiser race ;</l>
     <l n="23">Cats also feel , as well as we ,</l>
     <l n="24">That passion 's force , and so did she .</l>
     <l n="25">Her climbing , she began to find ,</l>
     <l n="26">Exposed her too much to the wind ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the old utensil of tin</l>
     <l n="28">Was cold and comfortless within :</l>
     <l n="29">She therefore wish 'd instead of those</l>
     <l n="30">Some place of more serene repose ,</l>
     <l n="31">Where neither cold might come , nor air</l>
     <l n="32">Too rudely wanton with her hair ,</l>
     <l n="33">And sought it in the likeliest mode</l>
     <l n="34">Within her master 's snug abode .</l>
     <l n="35">A drawer , it chanced , at bottom lined</l>
     <l n="36">With linen of the softest kind ,</l>
     <l n="37">With such as merchants introduce</l>
     <l n="38">From India , for the ladies ’ use ,</l>
     <l n="39">A drawer impending o'er the rest ,</l>
     <l n="40">Half open in the topmost chest ,</l>
     <l n="41">Of depth enough , and none to spare ,</l>
     <l n="42">Invited her to slumber there ;</l>
     <l n="43">Puss with delight beyond expression ,</l>
     <l n="44">Survey 'd the scene , and took possession .</l>
     <l n="45">Recumbent at her ease , ere long ,</l>
     <l n="46">And lull 'd by her own humdrum song ,</l>
     <l n="47">She left the cares of life behind ,</l>
     <l n="48">And slept as she would sleep her last ,</l>
     <l n="49">When in came , housewifely inclined ,</l>
     <l n="50">The chambermaid , and shut it fast ;</l>
     <l n="51">By no malignity impell 'd ,</l>
     <l n="52">But all unconscious whom it held .</l>
     <l n="53">Awaken 'd by the shock ( cried Puss )</l>
     <l n="54">“ Was ever cat attended thus ?</l>
     <l n="55">The open drawer was left , I see ,</l>
     <l n="56">Merely to prove a nest for me ,</l>
     <l n="57">For soon as I was well composed ,</l>
     <l n="58">Then came the maid , and it was closed ,</l>
     <l n="59">How smooth these ‘ kerchiefs , and how sweet !</l>
     <l n="60">O what a delicate retreat !</l>
     <l n="61">I will resign myself to rest</l>
     <l n="62">Till Sol , declining in the west ,</l>
     <l n="63">Shall call to supper , when , no doubt ,</l>
     <l n="64">Susan will come and let me out . ”</l>
     <l n="65">The evening came , the sun descended ,</l>
     <l n="66">And Puss remain 'd still unattended .</l>
     <l n="67">The night roll 'd tardily away ,</l>
     <l n="68">( With her indeed ‘ twas never day ,)</l>
     <l n="69">The sprightly morn her course renew 'd ,</l>
     <l n="70">The evening grey again ensued ,</l>
     <l n="71">And puss came into mind no more</l>
     <l n="72">Than if entomb 'd the day before .</l>
     <l n="73">With hunger pinch 'd , and pinch 'd for room ,</l>
     <l n="74">She now presaged approaching doom ,</l>
     <l n="75">Nor slept a single wink , or purr 'd ,</l>
     <l n="76">Conscious of jeopardy incurr 'd .</l>
     <l n="77">That night , by chance , the poet watching ,</l>
     <l n="78">Heard an inexplicable scratching ;</l>
     <l n="79">His noble heart went pit-a-pat ,</l>
     <l n="80">And to himself he said — “ What 's that ? ”</l>
     <l n="81">He drew the curtain at his side ,</l>
     <l n="82">And forth he peep 'd , but nothing spied .</l>
     <l n="83">Yet , by his ear directed , guess 'd</l>
     <l n="84">Something imprison 'd in the chest ,</l>
     <l n="85">And , doubtful what , with prudent care</l>
     <l n="86">Resolved it should continue there .</l>
     <l n="87">At length a voice which well he knew ,</l>
     <l n="88">A long and melancholy mew ,</l>
     <l n="89">Saluting his poetic ears ,</l>
     <l n="90">Consoled him and dispell 'd his fears :</l>
     <l n="91">He left his bed , he trod the floor ,</l>
     <l n="92">He ‘ gan in haste the drawers explore ,</l>
     <l n="93">The lowest first , and without stop</l>
     <l n="94">The rest in order to the top .</l>
     <l n="95">For ‘ tis a truth well known to most ,</l>
     <l n="96">That whatsoever thing is lost ,</l>
     <l n="97">We seek it , ere it come to light ,</l>
     <l n="98">In every cranny but the right .</l>
     <l n="99">Forth skipp 'd the cat , not now replete</l>
     <l n="100">As erst with airy self-conceit ,</l>
     <l n="101">Nor in her own fond apprehension</l>
     <l n="102">A theme for all the world 's attention ,</l>
     <l n="103">But modest , sober , cured of all</l>
     <l n="104">Her notions hyperbolical ,</l>
     <l n="105">And wishing for a place of rest</l>
     <l n="106">Any thing rather than a chest .</l>

     <l n="17">Thou wast a bauble once , a cup and ball</l>

     <l n="30">Ye reasoners broad awake , whose busy search</l>
     <l n="31">Of argument , employ 'd too oft amiss ,</l>
     <l n="32">Sifts half the pleasures of short life away !</l>
     <l n="33">Thou fell'st mature ; and , in the loamy clod</l>
     <l n="34">Swelling with vegetative force instinct ,</l>
     <l n="35">Didst burst thine egg , as theirs the fabled twins ,</l>

     <l n="40">Who lived when thou wast such ? Oh , could'st thou speak ,</l>
     <l n="41">As in Dodona once thy kindred trees</l>
     <l n="42">Oracular , I would not curious ask</l>
     <l n="43">The future , best unknown , but at thy mouth</l>
     <l n="44">Inquisitive , the less ambiguous past .</l>

     <l n="46">The clock of history , facts and events</l>
     <l n="47">Timing more punctual , unrecorded facts</l>
     <l n="48">Recovering , and misstated setting right —</l>

     <l n="50">Time made thee what thou wast , king of the woods ;</l>
     <l n="51">And time hath made thee what thou art — a cave</l>
     <l n="52">For owls to roost in . Once thy spreading boughs</l>
     <l n="53">O'erhung the champaign ; and the numerous flocks</l>

     <l n="55">Uncrowded , yet safe shelter 'd from the storm .</l>
     <l n="56">No flock frequents thee now . Thou hast outlived</l>
     <l n="57">Thy popularity , and art become</l>
     <l n="58">( Unless verse rescue thee awhile ) a thing</l>
     <l n="59">Forgotten , as the foliage of thy youth .</l>
     <l n="60">While thus through all the stages thou hast push 'd</l>
     <l n="61">Of treeship — first a seedling , hid in grass ;</l>
     <l n="62">Then twig ; then sapling ; and , as century roll 'd</l>
     <l n="63">Slow after century , a giant bulk</l>
     <l n="64">Of girth enormous , with moss-cushion 'd root</l>
     <l n="65">Upheaved above the soil , and sides emboss 'd</l>
     <l n="66">With prominent wens globose — till at the last</l>
     <l n="67">The rottenness , which time is charged to inflict</l>
     <l n="68">On other mighty ones , found also thee .</l>

     <l n="75">Transmitting cloudless , and the solar beam</l>
     <l n="76">Now quenching in a boundless sea of clouds —</l>
     <l n="77">Calm and alternate storm , moisture , and drought ,</l>
     <l n="78">Invigorate by turns the springs of life</l>
     <l n="79">In all that live , plant , animal , and man ,</l>

     <l n="87">The great and little of thy lot , thy growth</l>
     <l n="88">From almost nullity into a state</l>
     <l n="89">Of matchless grandeur , and declension thence ,</l>
     <l n="90">Slow , into such magnificent decay .</l>
     <l n="91">Time was when , settling on thy leaf , a fly</l>
     <l n="92">Could shake thee to the root — and time has been</l>
     <l n="93">When tempests could not . At thy firmest age</l>
     <l n="94">Thou hadst within thy bole solid contents</l>

     <l n="102">The bottomless demands of contest waged</l>
     <l n="103">For senatorial honours . Thus to time</l>
     <l n="104">The task was left to whittle thee away</l>
     <l n="105">With his sly scythe , whose ever-nibbling edge ,</l>
     <l n="106">Noiseless , an atom , and an atom more ,</l>

     <l n="15">by Cowper in the Gentleman 's Magazine .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>In the year 1774 , being much indisposed both in mind and body , incapable of diverting myself either with company or books , and yet in a condition that made some diversion necessary , I was glad of any thing that would engage my attention , without fatiguing it . The children of a neighbour of mine had a leveret given them for a plaything ; it was at that time about three months old . Understanding better how to tease the poor creature than to feed it , and soon becoming weary of their charge , they readily consented that their father , who saw it pining and growing leaner every day , should offer it to my acceptance . I was willing enough to take the prisoner under my protection , perceiving that , in the management of such an animal , and in the attempt to tame it , I should find just that sort of employment which my case required . It was soon known among the neighbours that I was pleased with the present , and the consequence was , that in a short time I had as many leverets offered to me as would have stocked a paddock . I undertook the care of three , which it is necessary that I should here distinguish by the names I gave them — Puss , Tiney , and Bess . Notwithstanding the two feminine appellatives , I must inform you , that they were all males . Immediately commencing carpenter , I built them houses to sleep in ; each had a separate apartment , so contrived that their ordure would pass through the bottom of it ; an earthen pan placed under each received whatsoever fell , which being duly emptied and washed , they were thus kept perfectly sweet and clean . In the day time they had the range of a hall , and at night retired each to his own bed , never intruding into that of another .</p>
   <p>Puss grew presently familiar , would leap into my lap , raise himself upon his hinder feet , and bite the hair from my temples . He would suffer me to take him up , and to carry him about in my arms , and has more than once fallen fast asleep upon my knee . He was ill three days , during which time I nursed him , kept him apart from his fellows , that they might not molest him ( for , like many other wild animals , they persecute one of their own species that is sick ,) and by constant care , and trying him with a variety of herbs , restored him to perfect health . No creature could be more grateful than my patient after his recovery ; a sentiment which he most significantly expressed by licking my hand , first the back of it , then the palm , then every finger separately , then between all the fingers , as if anxious to leave no part of it unsaluted ; a ceremony which he never performed but once again upon a similar occasion . Finding him extremely tractable , I made it my custom to carry him always after breakfast into the garden , where he hid himself generally under the leaves of a cucumber vine , sleeping or chewing the cud till evening ; in the leaves also of that vine he found a favourite repast . I had not long habituated him to this taste of liberty , before he began to be impatient for the return of the time when he might enjoy it . He would invite me to the garden by drumming upon my knee , and by a look of such expression as it was not possible to misinterpret . If this rhetoric did not immediately succeed , he would take the skirt of my coat between his teeth , and pull it with all his force . Thus Puss might be said to be perfectly tamed ; the shyness of his nature was done away , and on the whole it was visible by many symptoms , which I have not room to enumerate , that he was happier in human society than , when shut up with his natural companions .</p>
   <p>Not so Tiney ; upon him the kindest treatment had not the least effect . He too was sick , and in his sickness had an equal share of my attention ; but if , after his recovery , I took the liberty to stroke him , he would grunt , strike with his fore feet , spring forward , and bite . He was however very entertaining in his way ; even his surliness was matter of mirth , and in his play he preserved such an air of gravity , and performed his feats with such a solemnity of manner , that in him too I had an agreeable companion .</p>
   <p>Bess , who died soon after he was full grown , and whose death was occasioned by his being turned into his box , which had been washed , while it was yet damp , was a hare of great humour and drollery . Puss was tamed by gentle usage ; Tiney was not to be tamed at all ; and Bess had a courage and confidence that made him tame from the beginning . I always admitted them into the parlour after supper , when , the carpet affording their feet a firm hold , they would frisk , and bound , and play a thousand gambols , in which Bess , being remarkably strong and fearless , was always superior to the rest , and proved himself the Vestris of the party . One evening , the cat being in the room , had the hardiness to pat Bess upon the cheek , an indignity which he resented by drumming upon her back with such violence that the cat was happy to escape from under his paws , and hide herself .</p>
   <p>I describe these animals as having each a character of his own . Such they were in fact , and their countenances were so expressive of that character , that , when I looked only on the face of either , I immediately knew which it was . It is said that a shepherd , however numerous his flock , soon becomes so familiar with their features , that he can , by that indication only , distinguish each from all the rest ; and yet , to a common observer , the difference is hardly perceptible . I doubt not that the same discrimination in the cast of countenances would be discoverable in hares , and am persuaded that among a thousand of them no two could be found exactly similar : a circumstance little suspected by those who have not had opportunity to observe it . These creatures have a singular sagacity in discovering the minutest alteration that is made in the place to which they are accustomed , and instantly apply their nose to the examination of a new object . A small hole being burnt in the carpet , it was mended with a patch , and that patch in a moment underwent the strictest scrutiny . They seem too to be very much directed by the smell in the choice of their favourites : to some persons , though they saw them daily , they could never be reconciled , and would even scream when they attempted to touch them ; but a miller coming in engaged their affections at once ; his powdered coat had charms that were irresistible . It is no wonder that my intimate acquaintance with these specimens of the kind has taught me to hold the sportman 's amusement in abhorrence ; he little knows what amiable creatures he persecutes , of what gratitude they are capable , how cheerful they are in their spirits , what enjoyment they have of life , and that , impressed as they seem with a peculiar dread of man , it is only because man gives them peculiar cause for it .</p>
   <p>That I may not be tedious , I will just give a short summary of those articles of diet that suit them best .</p>
   <p>I take it to be a general opinion , that they graze , but it is an erroneous one , at least grass is not their staple ; they seem rather to use it medicinally , soon quitting it for leaves of almost any kind . Sowthistle , dandelion , and lettuce , are their favourite vegetables , especially the last . I discovered by accident that fine white sand is in great estimation with them ; I suppose as a digestive . It happened , that I was cleaning a birdcage when the hares were with me ; I placed a pot filled with such sand upon the floor , which , being at once directed to it by a strong instinct , they devoured voraciously ; since that time I have generally taken care to see them well supplied with it . They account green corn a delicacy , both blade and stalk , but the ear they seldom eat : straw of any kind , especially wheat-straw , is another of their dainties : they will feed greedily upon oats , but if furnished with clean straw never want them ; it serves them also for a bed , and , if shaken up daily , will be kept sweet and dry for a considerable time . They do not indeed require aromatic herbs , but will eat a small quantity of them with great relish , and are particularly fond of the plant called musk ; they seem to resemble sheep in this , that , if their pasture be too succulent , they are very subject to the rot ; to prevent which , I always made bread their principal nourishment , and , filling a pan with it cut into small squares , placed it every evening in their chambers , for they feed only at evening and in the night ; during the winter , when vegetables were not to be got , I mingled this mess of bread with shreds of carrot , adding to it the rind of apples cut extremely thin ; for , though they are fond of the paring , the apple itself disgusts them . These however not being a sufficient substitute for the juice of summer herbs , they must at this time be supplied with water ; but so placed , that they cannot overset it into their beds . I must not omit , that occasionally they are much pleased with twigs of hawthorn , and of the common brier , eating even the very wood when it is of considerable thickness .</p>
   <p>Bess , I have said , died young ; Tiney lived to be nine years old , and died at last , I have reason to think , of some hurt in his loins by a fall ; Puss is still living , and has just completed his tenth year , discovering no signs of decay , nor even of age , except that he is grown more discreet and less frolicsome than he was . I cannot conclude without observing , that I have lately introduced a dog to his acquaintance , a spaniel that had never seen a hare to a hare that had never seen a spaniel . I did it with great caution , but there was no real need of it . Puss discovered no token of fear , nor Marquis the least symptom of hostility . There is therefore , it should seem , no natural antipathy between dog and hare , but the pursuit of the one occasions the flight of the other , and the dog pursues because he is trained to it ; they eat bread at the same time out of the same hand , and are in all respects sociable and friendly .</p>
   <p>I should not do complete justice to my subject , did I not add , that they have no ill scent belonging to them , that they are indefatigably nice in keeping themselves clean , for which purpose nature has furnished them with a brush under each foot ; and that they are never infested by any vermin .</p>

    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 836 ]</span>This tale is founded on an article which appeared in the Buckinghamshire Herald , Saturday , June 1 , 1793 ;— “ Glasgow , May 23 . In a block , or pulley , near the head of the mast of a gabert , now lying at the Broomielaw , there is a chaffinch 's nest and four eggs . The nest was built while the vessel lay at Greenock , and was followed hither by both birds . Though the block is occasionally lowered for the inspection of the curious , the birds have not forsaken the nest . The cock , however , visits the nest but seldom , while the hen never leaves it , but when she descends to the hull for food . ”</head>

    <head>TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS .</head>
     <l n="1">DEAR President , whose art sublime</l>
     <l n="2">Gives perpetuity to time ,</l>
     <l n="3">And bids transactions of a day ,</l>
     <l n="4">That fleeting hours would waft away</l>
     <l n="5">To dark futurity , survive ,</l>
     <l n="6">And in unfading beauty live ,—</l>
     <l n="7">You cannot with a grace decline</l>
     <l n="8">A special mandate of the Nine —</l>
     <l n="9">Yourself , whatever task you choose ,</l>
     <l n="10">So much indebted to the Muse .</l>
     <l n="11">Thus say the sisterhood :— We come —</l>
     <l n="12">Fix well your pallet on your thumb ,</l>
     <l n="13">Prepare the pencil and the tints —</l>
     <l n="14">We come to furnish you with hints .</l>
     <l n="15">French disappointment , British glory ,</l>
     <l n="16">Must be the subject of the story .</l>
     <l n="17">First strike a curve , a graceful bow ,</l>
     <l n="18">Then slope it to a point below ;</l>
     <l n="19">Your outline easy , airy , light ,</l>
     <l n="20">Fill 'd up , becomes a paper kite .</l>
     <l n="21">Let independence , sanguine , horrid ,</l>
     <l n="22">Blaze like a meteor in the forehead :</l>
     <l n="23">Beneath ( but lay aside your graces )</l>
     <l n="24">Draw six-and-twenty rueful faces ,</l>
     <l n="25">Each with a staring , stedfast eye ,</l>
     <l n="26">Fix 'd on his great and good ally .</l>
     <l n="27">France flies the kite — ‘ tis on the wing —</l>
     <l n="28">Britannia 's lightning cuts the string .</l>
     <l n="29">The wind that raised it , ere it ceases ,</l>
     <l n="30">Just rends it into thirteen pieces ,</l>
     <l n="31">Takes charge of every fluttering sheet ,</l>
     <l n="32">And lays them all at George 's feet .</l>
     <l n="33">Iberia , trembling from afar ,</l>
     <l n="34">Renounces the confederate war .</l>
     <l n="35">Her efforts and her arts o'ercome ,</l>
     <l n="36">France calls her shatter 'd navies home .</l>
     <l n="37">Repenting Holland learns to mourn</l>
     <l n="38">The sacred treaties she has torn ;</l>
     <l n="39">Astonishment and awe profound</l>
     <l n="40">Are stamp 'd upon the nations round :</l>
     <l n="41">Without one friend , above all foes ,</l>
     <l n="42">Britannia gives the world repose .</l>

I have accordingly satirized myself in two stanzas which I composed last night , while I lay awake , tormented with pain , and well dosed with laudanum . If you find them not very brilliant , therefore , you will know how to account for it .— Letter to Joseph Hill , Esq . dated April 15 , 1792 .</p>

    <head>SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF THE REV . JOHN NEWTON .</head>
    <head>The Rev . John Newton has formed too prominent a feature in the life and correspondence of Cowper , and is too intimately associated with his endeared name , not to require a brief notice of the leading events of his life , on introducing those beautiful Olney Hymns which were written by Cowper . Any detailed statement is rendered unnecessary by his own memoir of himself ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 847 ]</span>and a subsequent one by the Rev . Mr. Cecil . The life of Newton abounds with the most extraordinary incidents , resembling the fictions of romance , rather than the realities of common life . But the hand of God is so visible , and the ultimate triumph of divine grace is so signally displayed amidst the most daring provocations , as to render it one of the most remarkable biographical memoirs ever submitted to the public eye .</head>
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 847 ]</span>See The Life of the Rev . John Newton , written by himself ,</l>
     <l n="2">in a series of letters addressed to the Rev . Mr. Haweis .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Rev . John Newton was born in London the 24th of July , 1725 . His father was master of a ship in the Mediterranean trade . His mother was a pious character ; and it is to her that he was indebted , in his early years , for those religious impressions which , however subsequently weakened , were probably never wholly effaced . Her premature death deprived him of this excellent parent , at an age when he most needed her superintending care . When he was eleven years old he joined his father , and made five voyages with him to the Mediterranean . His early life seems to present a mingled detail of religious duties and declensions — relapses into sin , accompanied by strong convictions of his guilt and danger — providential warnings , which roused his conscience for a time , and were subsequently forgotten ; till at length , by successive instances of grieving God 's Holy Spirit , he sank into the very depths of wickedness . In the year 1742 he formed an attachment , equalling in degree all that the writers of romance have imagined ; but in its duration unalterable . In 1743 he was impressed , put on board a tender , from which he was released by the exertions of his father , and soon after entered the navy as a midshipman . Here he was seduced into infidel principles by one of his companions , who in a violent storm was swept into eternity , while he himself was mercifully spared . Having deserted his ship , he was overtaken , kept in irons , publicly whipped , and degraded from his office . He now became a prey to the most gloomy thoughts , and seemed to be given up to judicial hardness , and even to doubt the existence of a future state of being .</p>
   <p>We contemplate this period of his life with awe and terror . He subsequently engaged in the slave-trade on the coast of Africa , where his conduct awakened , even among the slaves , emotions of alarm and astonishment . In the midst of this daring impiety , Newton passed through every successive stage of providential dealings , from the first whisper of conscience , till the awful catalogue of judgments seemed to be utterly expended . Every thing was exhausted save the long-suffering and mercy of God . His guilt was equalled only by his misery . The slave-trade on the coast of Africa was to him the fit memorial of a captivity more galling in its character , more terrible in its consequences . At home , abroad , on the mighty deep , or on foreign shores , he carried with him the marks of his servitude , the taint of his corruption , and the visible wrath of an offended God .</p>
   <p>The divine dealings towards the children of pious parents are strongly illustrated in the foregoing narrative . We have often observed that they are generally the subjects of a special dispensation whenever they become wanderers from God . In mercy to the praying parent , as well as to the erring child , he never leaves them without repeated tokens of his displeasure and intimations of his will . He disappoints their hopes , blights their prospects , and brings upon them the day of his wrathful visitation . “ If his children forsake my law , and walk not in my judgments ; if they break my statutes , and keep not my commandments ; then will I visit their transgression with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes . Nevertheless , my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from him , nor suffer my faithfulness to fail . ” Psal . lxxxix . 30-33 .</p>
   <p>We by no means interpret this clause as generally conveying the assurance that the children of pious parents will ultimately be saved . The conclusion would be too absolute , and seem opposed to the testimony of facts . But we nevertheless believe that the prayers and instructions of a godly parent rise up , like the alms of Cornelius , as a memorial before God ; and that early impressions are seldom utterly effaced . They pursue the memory amid the tumult of business , the seductions of pleasure , and the broad path of sin . They are a powerful stimulant to conscience in moments of pain , depression , and sorrow ; till at length the cry of penitence often bursts from the overwhelmed heart , and the last accents have been known to be those of prayer and praise .</p>
   <p>We now proceed to detail the particulars of Newton 's conversion . This event occurs on his return homewards from the coast of Africa , when the ship is overtaken by a dreadful storm , and death seems to be inevitable . We extract the account from his own narrative .</p>
   <p>“ The 21st of March is a day much to be remembered by me , and I have never suffered it to pass wholly unnoticed since the year 1748 . On that day the Lord sent from on high , and delivered me out of deep waters . I began to think of my former religious professions ; the extraordinary turns in my life ; the calls , warnings , and deliverances I had met with ; the licentious course of my conversation , particularly my unparalleled effrontery in making the gospel-history the constant subject of profane ridicule . I thought , allowing the Scripture premises , there never was , nor could be such a sinner as myself ; and then , comparing the advantages I had broken through , I concluded at first , that my sins were too great to be forgiven . The Scripture likewise seemed to say the same ; for I had formerly been well acquainted with the Bible , and many passages upon this occasion returned upon my memory , particularly those awful passages , Prov . i . 24-31 ; Heb . vi . 4-6 ; and 2 Pet ii . 20 , which seemed so exactly to suit my case and character as to bring with them a presumptive proof of a divine original . Thus , as I have said , I waited with fear and impatience to receive my inevitable doom . Yet , though I had thoughts of this kind , they were exceedingly faint and disproportionate ; it was not till long after , ( perhaps several years ,) till I had gained some clear views of the infinite righteousness and grace of Jesus Christ my Lord , that I had a deep and strong apprehension of my state by nature and practice : and , perhaps , till then I could not have borne the sight . When I saw , beyond all probability , there was still hope of respite , and heard about six in the evening that the ship was freed from water , there arose a gleam of hope ; I thought I saw the hand of God displayed in our favour . I began to pray ; I could not utter the prayer of faith ; I could not draw near to a reconciled God , and call him Father . My prayer was like the cry of the ravens , which yet the Lord does not disdain to hear . I now began to think of that Jesus whom I had so often derided . I recollected the particulars of his life , and of his death : and death for sins not his own , but , as I remembered , for the sake of those who in their distress should put their trust in Him . And now I chiefly wanted evidence . The comfortless principles of infidelity were deeply riveted , and I rather wished than believed these things were real facts . The great question now was , how to obtain faith ? I speak not of an appropriating faith , ( of which I then knew neither the nature nor necessity ,) but how I should gain an assurance that the Scriptures were of divine inspiration , and a sufficient warrant for the exercise of trust and hope in God . One of the first helps I received ( in consequence of a determination to examine the New Testament more carefully ) was from Luke xi . 13 . I had been sensible that to profess faith in Jesus Christ , when in reality I did not believe his history , was no better than a mockery of a heart-searching God : but here I found a Spirit spoken of , which was to be communicated to those who ask it . Upon this I reasoned thus . If this book is true , the promise in this passage is true likewise . I have need of that very Spirit by which the whole was written , in order to understand it aright . He has engaged here to give that Spirit to those who ask . I must , therefore , pray for it ; and if it is of God , he will make good his own word . My purposes were strengthened by John vii . 17 . I concluded from thence , that though I could not say from my heart that I believed the gospel , yet I would for the present take it for granted , and that by studying it in this light I should be more and more confirmed in it . If what I am writing could be perused by our modern infidels , they would say ( for I too well know their manner ) that I was very desirous to persuade myself into this opinion . I confess I was ; and so would they be , if the Lord should show them , as he was pleased to show me at that time , the absolute necessity of some expedient to interpose between a righteous God and a sinful soul . Upon the gospel scheme I saw at least a peradventure of hope , but on every other side I was surrounded with black unfathomable despair . "[ 848 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 848 ]</span>See “ Life of Newton , ” prefixed to his works .</p>
   <p>Alluding to the means which he enjoyed at this eventful period , for acquiring spiritual light and knowledge , he observes , “ As to books , I had a New Testament , Stanhope , and a volume of Bishop Beveridge 's Sermons , one of which , upon our Lord 's passion , affected me much . In perusing the New Testament , I was struck with several passages , particularly that of the fig-tree , Luke xiii . ; the case of St. Paul , 1 Tim . i .; but particularly the prodigal , Luke xv .— a case I thought had never been so clearly exemplified as by myself . And then the goodness of the father in receiving , nay , in running to meet such a son , and this intended only to illustrate the Lord 's goodness to returning sinners ; this gained upon me . I continued much in prayer ; I saw that the Lord had interposed so far to save me ; and I hoped he would do more . The outward circumstances helped in this place to make me still more serious and earnest in crying to Him who alone could relieve me ; and sometimes I thought I could be content to die even for want of food , if I might but die a believer . Thus far I was answered , that before we arrived in Ireland I had a satisfactory evidence in my own mind of the truth of the gospel , as considered in itself , and its exact suitableness to answer all my needs . I saw that , by the way there pointed out , God might declare , not his mercy only , but his justice also , in the pardon of sin , on account of the obedience and sufferings of Jesus Christ . I stood in need of an Almighty Saviour , and such a one I found described in the New Testament . Thus far the Lord had wrought a marvellous thing . I was no longer an infidel . I heartily renounced my former profaneness ; I had taken up some right notions ; was seriously disposed , and sincerely touched with a sense of the undeserved mercy I had received , in being brought safe through so many dangers . I was sorry for my past misspent life , and purposed an immediate reformation : I was quite freed from the habit of swearing , which seemed to have been deeply rooted in me as a second nature . Thus , to all appearance , I was a new man . But though I cannot doubt that this change , so far as it prevailed , was wrought by the Spirit and power of God ; yet still I was greatly deficient in many respects . I was , in some degree , affected with a sense of my more enormous sins , but I was little aware of the innate evils of my heart . I had no apprehension of the spirituality and extent of the law of God . The hidden life of a Christian , as it consists in communion with God by Jesus Christ , and a continual dependence on him for hourly supplies of wisdom , strength , and comfort , was a mystery , of which I had as yet no knowledge . I acknowledged the Lord 's mercy in pardoning what was past , but depended chiefly upon my own resolution to do better for the time to come . I had no Christian friend or faithful minister to advise me that my strength was no more than my righteousness : and though I soon began to inquire for serious books , yet , not having spiritual discernment , I frequently made a wrong choice ; and I was not brought in the way of evangelical preaching or conversation , ( except a few times , when I heard but understood not ,) for six years after this period . Those things the Lord was pleased to discover to me gradually . I learned them here a little and there a little , by my own painful experience , at a distance from the common means and ordinances , and in the midst of the same course of evil company , and bad examples , as I had been conversant with for some time . From this period I could no more make a mock at sin , or jest with holy things ; I no more questioned the truth of Scripture , or lost a sense of the rebukes of conscience . Therefore I consider this as the beginning of my return to God , or rather of his return to me ; but I cannot consider myself to have been a believer ( in the full sense of the word ) till a considerable time afterwards . "[ 849 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 849 ]</span>Life of Newton .</p>
   <p>Progressive conversions seem to be most agreeable to the analogy of nature ; and though we by no means question the reality of instantaneous conversions , or consider that the grace of God is limited either to time , manner , or degree ; yet we have generally observed that they partake too much of a spirit of excitement to form a sure and safe test . The excitement of the senses is a dangerous ingredient in holy things , because they are equally susceptible of opposite impressions . Those conversions ultimately prove most solid and abiding , where the understanding is enlightened , the conscience roused , and the will subdued by the simultaneous energy and power that moves and purifies the feelings and affections of the heart .</p>
   <p>But in whatever manner it was accomplished , the conversion of Newton claims to rank among those memorable acts of divine grace which have invested the names of a Rochester , a Gardiner , and a Bunyan , with so much interest and celebrity . May we not also mark its affinity to the still more distinguished examples recorded in the sacred writings , such as a Manasses , or a Saul , prototypes not less in guilt than in mercy ? If any man could justly appropriate the words of the apostle , surely that individual was Newton . “ Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long suffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting . ” 1 Tim . i . 16 . Instances like these abound in edifying truths . They exhibit the divine sovereignty in legible and unerring characters . They serve also to confound the pride and self-glory of man , by proving that “ base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are ; that no flesh should glory in his presence . ” 1 Cor . i . 28 , 29 .</p>
   <p>But above all they proclaim that no man is beyond the reach of mercy , however guilty , depraved , or lost ; and that the door is never closed to the broken and contrite spirit . Let not then the penitent despair , nor yet the impenitent presume ; but rightly interpreting these wonderful and gracious dispensations , may many a returning prodigal , like Newton , exclaim in the accents of adoring faith and love , “ Who is a God like unto thee , that pardoneth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? He retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy . ” Micah vii . 18 .</p>
   <p>That we may proceed to the more important events of Newton 's subsequent history , we shall here briefly mention , that at this time he wrote to his father , who was then going out as Governor of York Fort , in Hudson 's Bay , where he died in 1750 . He previously gave his consent to his son 's marriage with Miss Catlett , the lady who had been the object of so long and romantic an attachment . They were united on the 1st of February , 1750 . After this event he made three voyages to Africa , devoting much of his time to classical and devotional studies , and performing public worship in his vessel according to the Liturgy of the Church of England , twice every day . The moral change which his mind had experienced is expressed in the following beautiful and edifying manner , strongly exemplifying the power of divine grace to raise and elevate the soul .</p>
   <p>“ To be at sea in these circumstances , withdrawn out of the reach of innumerable temptations , with opportunity and turn of mind disposed to observe the wonders of God in the great deep , with the two noblest objects of sight , the expanded heavens and the expanded ocean , continually in view ; and where evident interpositions of Divine Providence , in answer to prayer , occur almost every day ; these are helps to quicken and confirm the life of faith , which , in a good measure , supply to a religious sailor the want of those advantages which can be enjoyed only upon the shore . And , indeed , though my knowledge of spiritual things , as knowledge is usually estimated , was at this time very small ; yet I sometimes look back with regret on these scenes . I never knew sweeter or more frequent hours of divine communion , than in my two last voyages to Guinea , when I was either almost secluded from society on shipboard , or when on shore amongst the natives . I have wandered through the woods , reflecting on the singular goodness of the Lord to me , in a place where , perhaps , there was not a person that knew Him for some thousands of miles round about me .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ In desert woods , with thee , my God ,</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 850 ]</span>These lines are a translation from the following well-known passage of Propertius ; Newton piously applying to the Creator what the poet addresses to the creature .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>“ During the time I was engaged in the slave-trade I never had the least scruple as to its lawfulness . I was upon the whole satisfied with it , as the appointment Providence had marked out for me ; yet it was , in many respects , far from eligible . It was , indeed , accounted a genteel employment , and usually very profitable , though to me it did not prove so , the Lord seeing that a large increase of wealth would not be good for me . However , I considered myself as a sort of a gaoler or turnkey , and I was sometimes shocked with an employment that was perpetually conversant with chains , bolts , and shackles . In this view I had often petitioned in my prayers that the Lord , in his own time , would be pleased to fix me in a more humane calling , and , if it might be , place me where I might have more frequent converse with his people and ordinances , and be freed from those long separations from home which very often were hard to bear . My prayers were now answered , though in a way which I little expected . "[ 851 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 851 ]</span>Life of Newton .</p>
   <p>The circumstance to which he alludes may be briefly stated . When he was within two days of sailing on a new voyage , and to all appearance in good health , he was suddenly seized with a fit , which deprived him of sense and motion . It lasted about an hour , but left behind such symptoms as induced the physicians to judge that it would not be safe or prudent to proceed on the voyage . The event was remarkable . The person who was appointed to take his place , most of the officers , and many of the crew died , and the vessel was brought back to Liverpool with great difficulty .<span type="note_anchor">[ 852 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 852 ]</span>Ibid .</p>
   <p>Thus ended Newton 's connexion with Africa and the slave-trade and with a sea-faring mode of life . He was destined for higher ends , and the providence and grace of God soon pointed out a sphere more suited to his newly acquired views , and presenting ample means for extended usefulness .</p>
   <p>“ And now , ” he observes , “ having reason to close with the Apostle 's determination , ‘ to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified , ’ I devoted my life to the prosecution of spiritual knowledge , and resolved to pursue nothing but in subservience to this main design . "[ 853 ] With this view he acquired a sufficient proficiency in the Greek language , so as to read with facility the New Testament and Septuagint ; he then entered upon the study of the Hebrew , and two years afterwards engaged in the Syriac , besides reading the best writers in divinity , and attending on the ministry of men distinguished for their piety and their scriptural views . In reference to his own entrance on the sacred office , he thus states his sentiments .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 853 ]</span>Life of Newton .</p>
   <p>“ One word concerning my views to the ministry , and I have done . I have told you , that this was my dear mother 's hope concerning me ; but her death and the scenes of life in which I afterwards engaged , seemed to cut off the probability . The first desires of this sort in my own mind arose many years ago , from a reflection on Gal . i . 23 , 24 . ‘ But they had heard only , that he which persecuted us in times past , now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed . And they glorified God in me . ’ I could not but wish for such a public opportunity to testify the riches of divine grace . I thought I was , above most living , a fit person to proclaim that faithful saying , ‘ That Jesus Christ came into the world to save the chief of sinners ; ’ and as my life had been full of remarkable turns , and I seemed selected to show what the Lord could do , I was in some hopes that perhaps , sooner or later , he might call me into this service . "[ 854 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 854 ]</span>Ibid .</p>
   <p>This choice of Newton seemed to be not only a natural consequence of his newly-acquired state of mind , but to be in perfect conformity with those leadings of Providence which we have so fully recorded . Who so fit to proclaim the adorable mercy and goodness of God , the freeness of his grace , the severity of his justice , and the tenderness of his love , as he who had so recently gone through the whole of the mighty process ? Who could trace the natural obduracy and corruption of the human heart , the rebellion of the will , the vile slavery of sin , and the power that breaks its fetters , like him whose past history so forcibly illustrated these truths ? Men cannot teach others till they themselves are first taught of God ; and so long as this necessary discipline is wanting , preaching is but a sublime and empty declamation .</p>
   <p>Newton being further confirmed in his resolution by the judgment of some Christian friends , received a title to a curacy in Yorkshire , Dec. 16 , 1758 , and applied to the Archbishop of York , Dr. Gilbert , for ordination . As he had not however graduated at the University , he was rejected , the Archbishop alleging the rules and canons of the church . Four years after this period , in 1762 , having experienced a continuance of the same difficulties , and conscious that he was burying his talents , he was about to direct his zeal in another channel , when he was restrained by the influence of his wife . In reference to this trial , he makes the following reflection . “ The exercises of my mind upon this point , I believe , have not been peculiar to myself . I have known several persons , sensible , pious , of competent abilities , and cordially attached to the established church , who , being wearied out with repeated refusals of ordination , and , perhaps , not having the advantage of such an adviser as I had , have at length struck into the itinerant path , or settled among the Dissenters . Some of these , yet living , are men of respectable characters and useful in their ministry . But their influence , which would once have been serviceable to the true interests of the church of England , now rather operates against it . ”</p>
   <p>Finally , being recommended by the Earl of Dartmouth<span type="note_anchor">[ 855 ]</span>to Dr. Green , Bishop of Lincoln , of whose candour and kindness he speaks with much respect , he was ordained deacon at Buckden , April 29 , 1764 , and appointed to the curacy of Olney , Bucks . He received priest 's orders the year following .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 855 ]</span>Lord Dartmouth was the patron of the living of Olney and distinguished for his piety . It is due to this noble family to state , that in no instance has a vacancy in the living ever been filled up but in subserviency to the interests of true religion .</p>
   <p>In this sphere of duty Newton continued nearly sixteen years exercising the functions of his office with exemplary fidelity , going from house to house , and exhibiting a pattern of an excellent parish priest . By the munificence of John Thornton , Esq ., he was enabled to exercise the rites of hospitality and to dispense relief effectually to the poor . “ Be hospitable , ” said Mr. Thornton , “ and keep an open house for such as are worthy of entertainment . Help the poor and needy . I will statedly allow you 200l . a year , and readily send whatever you have occasion to draw for more . ” Newton once observed , that he thought he had received of Mr. Thornton upwards of 3 , 000l . in this way , during the time he resided at Olney .<span type="note_anchor">[ 856 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 856 ]</span>Cecil 's Memoir of Newton .</p>
   <p>Such traits do honour to human nature .</p>
   <p>One of the incidents which distinguishes the residence of Newton at Olney is his friendship and intercourse with Cowper . It is said , that this intercourse was injurious to the poet , and that Newton 's peculiar views , which were Calvinistic , increased the morbid turn of his mind . The doctrinal sentiments of Newton we shall shortly consider , without however entering upon a lengthened discussion unsuited to the character of the present work . But we hesitate not to affirm that though the standard of Newton was unquestionably more Calvinistic than what is generally adopted by the clergy in these times , the main doctrines which he held were the common fundamental principles of the Christian faith , and that no preacher could have been more practical in his views . In other respects , Newton was social in his spirit , affectionate in his feelings , and cultivated in his understanding . Having had ample means of ascertaining his real character , the editor can with truth assert that no man was more beloved , admired , and respected .</p>
   <p>We next examine Newton 's doctrinal views .</p>
   <p>The doctrines of Newton embraced all those great fundamental truths which distinguish the period of the reformation , and were continued downwards to the times of Charles I ., when an evident departure from sound doctrine is perceptible in the writers of that age , as well as in those which succeeded .<span type="note_anchor">[ 857 ]</span>We claim for Newton the praise of having been one among a few faithful witnesses who boldly proclaimed those truths , when religion was degenerating , with some few exceptions , into a system of moral ethics . It is to such men as Romaine , Venn , Berridge , Milner , Walker of Truro , Adam of Wintringham , Stillingfleet , Jones of St. Saviour 's , Newton , and a few others , that we owe that revival of piety which is now diffusing itself so generally among the members of our church . These doctrines comprise the fall and corruption of man , the divinity and offices of the Saviour , the necessity of conversion by the grace of the Holy Spirit , free justification by faith in the atonement , the work of sanctification in all its progressive stages , attested by the evidence of a holy and devoted life , founded on these views and principles .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 857 ]</span>Bishops Hall , Davenant , and Jeremy Taylor , are honourable exceptions .</p>
   <p>These great and important truths are generally called “ doctrines according to godliness ; ” that is , they constitute the only genuine spring and source of godliness . It cannot be effected without them , because the principle would be wanting which is alone competent to produce real holiness . They form the vital essence of Christianity , its distinguishing and essential badge , its grace , its ornament , and glory .</p>

   <p>We subjoin the testimony of an eminent prelate on this subject , delivered in a charge in the year 1792 . We refer to the venerable Bishop of Durham , Dr. Shute Barrington .</p>
   <p>“ All that distinguishes Christianity from other religions is doctrinal ; a Christian 's hopes and consolations , his obligations and motives , are doctrinal points ; the very means and end of his salvation , the many objects of his most earnest intention , are all points of faith and doctrine . Divest Christianity of its faith and doctrines , and you despoil it of all that is peculiar to it in its motives , its consolations , its sanctions , and its duties . You divest it of all that made revelation necessary ; you reduce it to the cold and ineffectual substance of what is called philosophy ; that philosophy which has of late shown itself not the friend of religion , learning , and civil order , but of anarchy , conceit , and atheism : you reduce it to the obscure glimmerings of human knowledge ; that knowledge which the greatest of the ancient philosophers<span type="note_anchor">[ 860 ]</span>confessed to be totally insufficient to satisfy the doubts and solicitude of an inquiring mind , and looked forward with a kind of prophetic exultation to the period when Divine Providence , in compassion to the weakness of our nature , should enlighten mankind by the revelation of himself , which modern philosophers reject . "[ 861 ]</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 861 ]</span>See Bishop of Durham 's Charge , ( Barrington ,) 1792 .</p>
   <p>We add the distinguished testimony of Archbishop Secker .</p>
   <p>“ To improve the people effectually , you must be assiduous in teaching the principles not only of virtue and natural religion , but of the gospel ; and of the gospel , not as almost explained away by modern refiners , but ‘ as the truth is in Jesus ; ’ as it is taught by the church of which you are members ; as you have engaged by your subscriptions and declarations , that you will teach it yourselves . You must preach to them faith in the ever-blessed Trinity ; you must set forth the original corruption of our nature ; our redemption , according to God 's eternal purpose in Christ , by the sacrifice of the cross ; our sanctification by the influences of the Divine Spirit ; the insufficiency of good works , and the efficacy of faith to salvation ....</p>
   <p>“ The truth , I fear , is , that many , if not most of us , have dwelt too little on these doctrines in our sermons , ... partly from not having studied theology deeply enough to treat of them ably and beneficially . God grant it may never have been for want of inwardly experiencing their importance . But , whatever be the cause , the effect has been lamentable . "[ 862 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 862 ]</span>See “ Watson 's Tracts , ” vol . vi .</p>
   <p>If a solemn and admonitory warning was ever conveyed to the Christian world on this subject , it has been afforded by the conduct of the church of Geneva . By a regulation , the breach of which was made punishable by expulsion , the great fundamental doctrines , such as the essential divinity of Christ , the doctrine of human corruption , the atonement , justification by faith , and the personality and offices of the Holy Spirit , were prohibited in the pulpit . The people , no longer accustomed to these important truths , soon forgot them , and the consequence has been the substitution of a cold and lifeless Socinianism . Had it not been for that band of faithful men in this country , so much misrepresented and traduced , who shall say whether , in our own communion , we might not have incurred the same fearful result ? They stood in the gap , like Phinehas , and the plague was stayed .</p>
   <p>We know all that is urged in opposition to this reasoning , and we will examine its merits . These doctrines , it is said , are overcharged . The corruption of human nature , for instance , instead of being described as partial , is represented to be total . Society , we are assured , could not exist on such a supposition .</p>
   <p>Let us listen to what Newton remarks on this subject .</p>
   <p>“ His natural powers , though doubtless impaired , were not destroyed . Man by nature is still capable of great things . His understanding , reason , memory , imagination , &amp; c. sufficiently proclaim that the ‘ hand which made him is divine . ’ He is , as Milton says of Beelzebub , ‘ majestic though in ruins . ’ He can reason , invent , and , by application , attain a considerable knowledge in natural things . The exertions of human genius , as specified in the characters of some philosophers , poets , orators , &amp; c. are wonderful . But man cannot know , love , trust or serve his Maker , unless he be renewed in the spirit of his mind . "[ 863 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 863 ]</span>See Newton 's “ Cardiphonia . ” Letter to Rev . Mr. S .</p>
   <p>“ Sin did not deprive him of rationality but of spirituality . "[ 864 ]</p>
   <p>Again : “ God has not left man destitute of such dispositions as are necessary to the peace of society ; but I deny that there is any moral goodness in them , unless they are founded in a supreme love to God , have his glory for their aim , and are produced by faith in Jesus Christ .

   <p>Thus man 's natural and moral powers survive the fall ; but those which are spiritual are effaced and lost . Nature cannot confer what it is the province of grace alone to bestow . It requires a divine power to restore and quicken the soul . But what is the doctrine of the church of England as regards man 's partial or total corruption ? We extract the following passage from the Homily on the Nativity :—</p>
   <p>“ Whereby it came to pass that , as before ( the fall ) he was blessed , so now he was accursed ; as before he was loved , so now he was abhorred ; as before he was most beautiful and precious , so now he was most vile and wretched in the sight of his Lord and Maker . Instead of the image of God , he was now become the image of the devil , instead of the citizen of heaven , he was become the bond slave of hell , having in himself no one part of his former purity and cleanness , but being altogether spotted and defiled , insomuch that now he seemed to be nothing else but a lump of sin .

   <p>We merely add one more remark on the much-controverted subject of conversion . To those who deny this doctrine , and describe it as “ spiritual revelry , ” pretended illuminations , &amp; c ., we recommend the consideration of the following passage in the Homily on Whitsunday . It refers to our Lord 's conversation with Nicodemus , and to the inability of the latter to comprehend this great spiritual change of heart .</p>
   <p>“ Behold a lively pattern of a fleshly and carnal man . He had little or no intelligence of the Holy Ghost , and therefore he goeth bluntly to work , and asketh how this thing were possible to be true . Whereas , otherwise , if he had known the great power of the Holy Ghost in this behalf , that it is He which inwardly worketh the regeneration and new birth of mankind , he would never have marvelled at Christ 's words , but would rather take occasion thereby to praise and glorify God . ”</p>
   <p>We have thought proper to adduce these testimonies , because they vindicate the doctrines of Newton , and of those who concur with him in these views . They fully prove how much the stability of our church , in the estimation of some of its ablest advocates , depends on the faithfulness with which these doctrines are maintained . On this subject we would beg to express our deepest conviction that , if the Church of England is to survive those perils by which she is threatened ; if , as we anticipate , she will rise from her tribulation with renewed strength and beauty ; it is to the purity of her doctrine , and to the devotedness of her ministers , and not to the richness of her endowments , or to the secular arm of the state , that she must be indebted for her durability and greatness . To be upheld , she must be “ strong in the Lord and in the power of his might , ” apostolical in her doctrines , restored in her discipline , and holy in her practice . The language shall then be addressed to her that is applied by the inspired prophet to Zion : “ No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper , and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn . ” Isaiah liv . 17 . Or , to use words still more emphatic , “ The gates of hell shall not prevail against her . ”</p>
   <p>Having thus generally vindicated the doctrines of Newton , we next advert to some of his writings . We make a few extracts from his Cardiphonia , the most popular of his writings , being a series of letters on religious subjects . The following is addressed to a nobleman , distinguished for his piety .</p>
   <p>“ To devote soul and body , every talent , power , and faculty , to the service of the Lord 's cause and will ; to let our light shine ( in our several situations ) to the praise of his grace ; to place our highest joy in the contemplation of his adorable perfections ; to rejoice even in tribulations and distresses , in reproaches and infirmities , if thereby the power of Christ may rest upon us , and be magnified in us ; to be content , yea , glad to be nothing , that he may be all in all ;— to obey him in opposition to the threats or solicitations of men ; to trust him , though all outward appearances seem against us ; to rejoice in him , though we should ( as will sooner or later be the case ) have nothing else to rejoice in ; to live above the world , and to have our conversation in heaven ; to be like the angels , finding our own pleasure in performing his ;— this , my Lord , is the prize , the mark of our high calling , to which we are encouraged with a holy ambition continually to aspire . It is true , we shall still fall short ; we shall find that , when we should do good , evil will be present with us ; but the attempt is glorious , and shall not be wholly in vain . He that gives us thus to will , will enable us to perform with growing success , and teach us to profit even by our mistakes and imperfections . "[ 867 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 867 ]</span>“ Cardiphonia . ” Letters to a Nobleman .</p>
   <p>The privileges of the believer are thus set forth .</p>
   <p>“ How great and honourable is the privilege of a true believer ! That he has neither wisdom nor strength in himself is no disadvantage ; for he is connected with infinite wisdom and almighty power . Though weak as a worm , his arms are strengthened by the mighty God of Jacob , and all things become possible , yea , easy to him , that occur within the compass of his proper duty and calling . The Lord , whom he serves , engages to proportion his strength to his day , whether it be a day of service or of suffering ; and , though he be fallible and short-sighted , exceedingly liable to mistake and imposition , yet , while he retains a sense that he is so , and with the simplicity of a child asks counsel and direction of the Lord , he seldom takes a wrong step , at least not in matters of consequence ; and even his inadvertencies are overruled for good . If he forgets his true state , and thinks himself to be something , he presently finds he is indeed nothing ; but if he is content to be nothing , and to have nothing , he is sure to find a seasonable and abundant communication of all that he wants . Thus he lives , like Israel in the wilderness , upon mere bounty ; but then it is a bounty unchangeable , unwearied , inexhaustible , and all-sufficient . "[ 868 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 868 ]</span>“ Cardiphonia . ”</p>
   <p>The believer 's call , duty , and privilege is thus illustrated by the happy application of Milton 's character of Abdiel , at the end of book 5 , of the “ Paradise Lost . ” The compliment to his noble friend is just and merited .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Faithful found</l>
     <l n="2">Among the faithless , faithful only he ,</l>
     <l n="3">Among innumerable false , unmov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="4">Unshaken , unseduc 'd , unterrified ,</l>
     <l n="5">His loyalty he kept , his love , his zeal ;</l>
     <l n="6">Nor number , nor example , with him wrought</l>
     <l n="7">To swerve from truth , or change his constant mind</l>
     <l n="8">Though single . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Methinks your Lordship 's situation particularly resembles that in which the poet has placed Abdiel . You are not indeed called to serve God quite alone ; but , amongst those of your own rank , and with whom the station in which he has placed you necessitates you to converse , how few are there who can understand , second , or approve the principles upon which you act ; or easily bear a conduct which must impress conviction or reflect dishonour upon themselves ! But you are not alone . The Lord 's people ( many of whom you will not know till you meet them in glory ) are helping you here with their prayers . His angels are commissioned to guard and guide your steps . Yea , the Lord himself fixes his eye of mercy upon your private and public path , and is near you at your right hand , that you may not be moved ! That he may comfort you with the light of his countenance , and uphold you with the arm of his power , is my frequent prayer . "[ 869 ]</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 869 ]</span>Ibid .</p>
   <p>Such is the sweet strain of practical and experimental piety in which Newton writes , uniting the graces of composition with the courtesy of Christian feeling , and the sentiments of an exalted piety . The nobleman , to whom these letters are addressed , ( twenty-six in number ,) was the Earl of Dartmouth , the patron of the living of Olney . Happy would it be if men of rank were always willing to listen to such truths , and the pen of a Newton could record them with so much faithfulness and grace . The date of this correspondence commences in the year 1765 , and terminates in 1777 . The succeeding eight letters , to the Rev . Mr. S ., are addressed to the Rev . Thomas Scott , and will be shortly adverted to . Mr. B ., to whom eleven letters are inscribed , is Mr. Barham , the father of the late Jos . Foster Barham , Esq . M. P . One letter is addressed to the latter , as Mr. B ., jun . ; and Miss M. B ., is Miss Martha Barham , his sister . The Rev . Mr. R ., is Mr. Rose , late Rector of Beckenham , who married her sister . I am enabled to verify these facts from family connexion , and personal knowledge . Besides these letters , Newton was the author of “ Omicron , ” “ Letters to a Wife , ” “ Review of Ecclesiastical History , ” “ Sermons , ” “ The Aged Pilgrim 's Triumph , ” “ Life of the Rev . William Grimshawe , ” an ancestor of the Editor , distinguished for his piety and laborious exertions , though accompanied with some peculiarities ; I cannot however record his name without reverence for his piety and zeal . The majority of the Olney Hymns were contributed by Newton , and have always been acceptable to the religious public . They are diversified in their subject , and uniformly spiritual and experimental , though inferior , as poetical compositions , to those contributed by Cowper .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>The last point of view in which Newton claims to be considered is , as the honoured instrument , in the hands of God , for raising up others who became eminent for piety and usefulness . We pass over many instances of comparatively less importance , and select two of known celebrity , the late Rev . Thomas Scott , and the Rev . Claudius Buchanan . Mr. Scott , at the time of Newton 's residence at Olney , was the curate of Ravenstone , in that neighbourhood . Though strictly conscientious , and earnest in the discharge of his duties , yet his views were indistinct , and his mind labouring under strong prejudices . The sentiments and principles of Newton , so opposite to his own , excited his attention . He was unable to comprehend them , and , as a natural consequence , deprecated and rejected them . Newton presented him with one of his publications , entitled “ Omicron . ” This led to a correspondence , which is inserted in the “ Cardiphonia . ” The influence of Newton 's arguments , though slow , was finally successful . The strong and powerful prejudices of Scott yielded , like the mists that are dispelled by the penetrating beams of the sun . He has recorded this eventful period of his life in his “ Force of Truth , ” a book which merits to be universally read . Mr. Scott 's subsequent career and usefulness are well known . He was “ a burning and a shining light . ” His “ Commentary on the Bible ” requires no eulogium , its praise is in all the churches . In America alone , we believe that not less than forty or fifty thousand copies have been sold . It is now circulating in France and in Switzerland . Perhaps no book has contributed so essentially to diffuse the great doctrines of the Reformation , and to revive the piety and spirit of former ages . We do not know a more splendid trophy to the name and usefulness of Newton , than to be recorded as the instrument , under the Divine blessing , of having raised up so distinguished a character as the Rev . Thomas Scott .</p>
   <p>The second instance is that of the Rev . Claudius Buchanan . Mr. Newton , after a residence of nearly sixteen years at Olney , was removed to London , having been presented , by the recommendation of John Thornton , Esq ., to the living of St. Mary Woolnoth . On a Sunday evening a stranger stood in one of the aisles of the church , while Newton was preaching . He became impressed with what he heard , and communicated to him the state of his mind : Newton admiring his talents , and anticipating his future usefulness , introduced him to the late Henry Thornton , Esq ., by whose liberality he was sent to college . He was afterwards ordained , and subsequently filled an important situation in the east . He at length returned to Europe to awaken Britain to the claims of India . The effect produced by his appeals , and by his celebrated sermon , “ The Star in the East , ” will long be remembered . He was eminently instrumental in rousing public attention to the duty of evangelizing India .</p>

   <p>Such is the history of Newton , abounding in the most singular and eventful incidents , and exhibiting a man not less distinguished by his piety than by his acknowledged talents and great usefulness . The moral truths that it conveys are both numerous and highly instructive . To parents it is fraught with the greatest encouragement , by proving that early impressions of piety , however they may seem to be extinguished by a long course of impenitence , may subsequently revive , though probably under the most solemn dispensations : “ Thou shalt be visited of the Lord with thunder , and with earthquake , and great noise , with storm and tempest , and the flame of devouring fire . ” Isaiah xxix . 6 . The mercy that spares in the midst of manifold provocations ; the long-suffering and goodness of God ; the doctrine of a particular Providence ; the strivings of his Spirit ; the necessity of the conversion of the soul to God ; and the ultimate triumphs of his grace ; how forcibly have these truths been illustrated in the foregoing narrative ! Reader , adore the wonderful power and grace of God ! See what this grace has done for others ! Learn what it is capable of effecting for yourself , and what an instrument of extended usefulness Providence may render you , when your own heart is once renewed by his Spirit ! Who shall trace the final consequences of a single soul thus brought to God ! The last great day alone can reveal the issue . If then you have not yet entered on this heavenly road , make the grand experiment in the strength and power of God . “ It is high time to awake out of sleep . ” “ The night is far spent , the day is at hand . ” Save thyself and others . Flee to the cross of Christ for pardon and mercy . Read the neglected Bible . Pour out the heart in fervent , persevering prayer ; and let thy faith be quickened , and thy fears assuaged by the gracious assurance , “ All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . ” Matt . xxi . 22 .</p>

    <head>PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE OLNEY HYMNS .</head>

   <p>The praise of having first effected a metrical version of the Psalms is to be assigned to France . About the year 1540 , Clement Marot , valet of the bedchamber to Francis I ., was the favourite poet of France . Being tired of the vanities of profane poetry , and anxious to raise the tone of public taste and feeling , he attempted a version of the Psalms into French rhyme , aided by Theodore Beza , and encouraged by the Professor of Hebrew in the University of Paris . This translation , not aiming at any innovation in the public worship , received the sanction of the Sorbonne , as containing nothing contrary to sound doctrine . Solicitous to justify this new application of his poetical powers , Marot expatiates in his dedication on the superior claims of sacred poetry , and observes “ that the golden age would now be restored , when we should see the peasant at his plough , the carman in the streets , and the mechanic in his shop , solacing their toils with psalms and canticles ; and the shepherd and shepherdess , reposing in the shade , and teaching the rocks to echo the name of the Creator .

   <p>CLEMENT MAROT .</p>
   <p>This version soon eclipsed the brilliancy of his madrigals and sonnets . In the festive and splendid court of Francis I. of a sudden nothing was heard but the psalms of Clement Marot . By each of the royal family and the principal nobility of the court , a psalm was chosen , and adapted to a popular ballad tune .</p>
   <p>Calvin soon discovered what a powerful auxiliary psalm-singing might prove to the reformed religion , and immediately introduced Marot 's version into his congregation at Geneva . They were adapted to plain and easy melodies<span type="note_anchor">[ 873 ]</span>by Guillaume de Franc , and became a characteristic badge of the newly established worship . Germany next caught the sacred ardour , and the choral mode of service yielded to the attractive and popular character of a devotional melody , in which all might join , without distinction of rank or character . Psalms singing being thus associated with the Reformed religion , became interdicted to the Catholics under the most severe penalties .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 873 ]</span>This mode of adaptation may be seen in the “ Godly and Spiritual Songs , ” &amp; c. printed at Edinburgh in 1597 , and reprinted there in 1801 .— Park .</p>
   <p>This predilection for sacred song soon reached England . Previously however to this event , Sir Thomas Wyatt and the celebrated Lord Surrey had translated portions of the Psalms into metre . We subjoin a brief specimen from each of these writers , as illustrating the style and poetical pretensions of that early period of English literature .</p>

     <l n="26">Earl of Surrey .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Sir Thomas Wyatt versified the seven Penitential Psalms , and died in 1542 . The Earl of Surrey honoured his memory and virtues by three sonnets . Five years afterwards this distinguished and highly-gifted nobleman fell a victim to the tyranny of Henry VIII . and was beheaded , in the year 1547 . He has left a version of the eighth , fifty-fifth , seventy-third , and eighty-eighth Psalms .<span type="note_anchor">[ 874 ]</span></p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 874 ]</span>There is also a fragment of a comment on the Seven</l>
     <l n="2">Penitential Psalms , in English verse , attributed to Dr. Alcock ,</l>
     <l n="3">Bishop of Ely , the founder of Jesus College , Cambridge .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The versification of Sternhold and Hopkins , the first that was ever used in the Church of England , next demands our attention . Sternhold was groom of the robes to Henry VIII . It is singular that both in France and England we are indebted to laymen and court poets for the introduction of what subsequently became so characteristic a feature in the reformed worship . Sternhold composed fifty-one Psalms , and dedicated his version to King Edward VI . His coadjutor in this undertaking was John Hopkins , a clergyman and school-master , in Suffolk . His poetry is rather of a higher order than that of Sternhold . He translated fifty-eight Psalms . To the above may be added the names of William Whyttingham , Dean of Durham , who added sixteen Psalms . The hundredth and hundred and nineteenth Psalms were included in this number . The rest were contributed by Robert Wisdome , Archdeacon of Ely ; by William Hethe , a Scotch divine ; John Pullain , and Thomas Churchyard , one of the pages of the Earl of Surrey . The entire version of the Psalter was at length published by John Day , in 1562 , attached for the first time to the Common Prayer , and entitled , “ The whole Booke of Psalmes , collected into English metre , by J. Sternhold , J. Hopkins , and others , conferred with the Ebrue , with apt Notes to sing them withall . ”</p>
   <p>They are believed to contain some of the original melodies composed by French and German musicians . Many of them are the tunes of Gondinel and Le Jeune , who are among the first composers of Marot 's French psalms . Not a few were probably imported by the Protestant refugees from Flanders , who fled into England from the persecution of the Duke of Alva . Some of our own musicians , such as Marbeck , Tallis , Tye , Parsons , and Munday , are supposed to have contributed their talents towards this undertaking .</p>
   <p>We insert a few extracts from the original version , which in this refined age will appear rather ludicrous , and unsuited to the dignity of sacred poetry .</p>

   <p>Though this version has undergone many revisions , yet we fully agree with Warton , that its continued use is discreditable to the Church of England .<span type="note_anchor">[ 875 ]</span>The translation , in its genuine and unsophisticated state , may justly indeed be considered , as he observes , no inconsiderable monument of our ancient literature , if not of our ancient poetry ; and Fuller , likewise , remarks , “ Match these verses for their ages , they shall go abreast with the best poems of those times . ” Still the spirit of the present age demands a higher standard both of poetical taste and devotional piety . They are too bald and jejune . The public feeling requires a more luminous exhibition of the great truths of the gospel , and a more experimental mode of delineating the trials and conflicts of the Christian warfare . No man has accomplished this important task more successfully than Watts . He has united the inspiration of poetry with the hallowed fire from the altar ; and we hesitate not to assert , that if Watts had been a churchman , his version would have been in universal repute among us . It is already incorporated with most of the modern selections , where there is a return to the doctrines of the Reformation ; and Sternhold and Hopkins are becoming increasingly unsuited to the advancing spirit of religious inquiry .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 875 ]</span>Warton 's censure is expressed in very strong language . “ To the disgrace of sacred music , sacred poetry , and our established worship , these Psalms still continue to be sung in the Church of England . ” See History of English Poetry , vol . ii . p. 461 .</p>
   <p>It was this conviction that induced Newton , in the year 1771 , to engage in the composition of the Olney Hymns . They were designed to be the joint contribution of Newton and Cowper , but the morbid depression of the poet prevented the fulfilment of his share of the engagement . The total number contributed by Cowper has been variously stated . Hayley estimates it at sixty-eight . Other biographers have considerably reduced the amount . Some editions assign sixty-three ; others insert sixty-five . There is at present no uniform standard , nor is there , to the best of our judgment , one single edition entitled to the credit of correctness .<span type="note_anchor">[ 876 ]</span>We trust that we have the means of deciding this controverted subject . So far as the original edition , now lying before us , published , under the superintendence of Newton himself , by Johnson , the bookseller , and bearing the date of 1779 , may be considered as the most authentic guide and criterion , we are enabled to state that the original number , distinguished by the initial letter C ( Cowper 's signature ) is sixty-seven . If to the above we add a hymn not inserted in Newton 's original edition , because subsequently composed , but which we have been enabled to authenticate as the production of Cowper , the total number , entitled to be ascribed to his pen , is sixty-eight . The hymn that we allude to begins ,</p>
   <p>“ To Jesus , the crown of my hope . ”</p>
   <p>It has already appeared before the public in some modern selections .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 876 ]</span>One edition imputes two hymns of Newton 's to Cowper , by mistaking the numerical letter C for the initial of Cowper 's name .</p>
   <p>Of these hymns two were written at the period of Cowper 's recovery at St. Albans , when his mind had received those gracious impressions which so powerfully influenced his future principles and writings . The first which Cowper ever composed was in allusion to this event . It is entitled “ The Happy Change , ” and begins with the words ,</p>
   <p>“ How bless 'd thy creature is , O God . ”</p>
   <p>The second was written when he contemplated retiring from the busy world . It is the beautiful and admired hymn ,</p>
   <p>“ Far from the world , O Lord , I flee . ”</p>
   <p>It may be interesting to the reader to learn , from concurring sources of information , that the celebrated hymn commencing with</p>
   <p>“ God moves in a mysterious way , ”</p>
   <p>was the last in the collection that he composed , and that it was written on the eve of that afflicting malady , which , occurring in Jan. 1773 , suspended his powers for nearly seven successive years , though his correspondence was partially resumed with Mr. Hill and Mr. Unwin , from the year 1776 . It was during a solitary walk in the fields that he had a presentiment of his approaching attack , and it is to this remarkable impression that we owe the origin of the above admired composition .</p>
   <p>This hymn acquires a peculiar interest from the above incident , as well as from the unshaken faith and submission which it inculcates under the darkest dispensations . It seems as if God were giving him a chart of the voyage through those seas of trouble which he was about to navigate . No man could have written this hymn unless under the influence of a real or supposed special dispensation ; and one end perhaps designed by it was , that Cowper should not only convey instruction to his own mind , but be made the instrument of consoling others . Few hymns have been more admired or more frequently quoted . It stands pre-eminent in that class which refer to the mysterious dealings of God , and is singularly qualified to invigorate the faith , to check the speculations of finite reason , and to lead the sufferer to repose on the unerring wisdom and goodness of God .</p>
   <p>We must be careful , at the same time , how we reason on these subjects . That impressions of approaching trials may be sent from God , and subsequently be realised , we are by no means prepared to deny ; but that they are often the occasion of fulfilling themselves , by acting strongly on a nervous temperament , we still more firmly believe . Again , that they frequently exist , and are not confirmed by the result , is well known . On the whole , we think reason as well as Scripture militates strongly against the doctrine of impressions . There is often an order and progression in them which , if minutely traced , prove their fallacy . Anxiety first suggests fear . A too great sensitiveness of feeling , an excursive imagination , and the want of a more vigorous exercise of faith next invest what was only imaginary , with reality . It thus acquires a form and existence , next expands into magnitude , and then rises into the power and ascendency of an absorbing idea ; till , by a final deception , the impression is attributed to a divine hand . But who does not see that it is more justly to be ascribed to morbid sensibility , to nervous excitement , and , most of all , to the want of a firmer confidence in the power and goodness of God ? The language of Scripture is decidedly opposed to the theory of impressions . The Bible directs us never to indulge in anticipations of evil , and to “ take no thought for the morrow . ” An habitual trust in a superintending Providence will ever prove to be the best preservative against imaginary or real evil , and will fill the mind with the sweet calm of a holy and abiding peace .</p>
   <p>In returning to the subject of the Olney Hymns , we may remark that those contributed by Cowper are , with some few exceptions , distinguished by excellences of no common kind . To the grace and beauty of poetical composition they unite the sublimity of religious sentiment , and the tenderness and fervour of devotional feeling . The nearer approaches to the Deity , which constitute the communion of the soul with God , and in which the believer is able to contemplate him as a reconciled Father in Christ Jesus ; the sufficiency of divine grace to pardon all our sins , and to renew and sanctify the soul ; the aspirations of prayer for the attainment of these blessings , and the song of praise in the consciousness of their enjoyment ; the faith that reposes every care on his promises , and realizes their covenanted truth ;— such are the subjects on which Cowper delights to dwell with a fervour which gives new wings to our devotion , and raises us above the enfeebling vanity of earthly things .</p>
   <p>To specify all the hymns which lay claim to our admiration , would far exceed the limits of our plan , and interfere with the judgment and discrimination of the reader . We cannot , however , avoid referring to the following :— “ O for a closer walk with God ; ” “ Ere God had built the mountains : ” “ The Lord will happiness divine ; ” “ There is a fountain fill 'd with blood ; ” “ Hark , my soul , it is the Lord ; ” “ God of my life , to thee I call ; ” and especially , “ The billows swell , the winds are high . ” There is a character of experimental piety pervading the hymns of Cowper , which singularly adapts them to meet the feelings of the contemplative or tried Christian . The deeper and more secret emotions of the soul ; the vicissitudes of joy and sorrow ; the fears that depress , and the hopes that soothe and tranquillize the mind , are treated with a fidelity and pathos , that render Cowper emphatically the poet of the heart . His hymns possess one peculiar feature which powerfully engages our sympathies . They disclose the inward recesses , and deep exercises of his own mind . But the sorrows of Cowper are now ended . Every trace is obliterated , except the record of them which is stamped on his interesting page . He has entered within the vail , where the mysterious dispensations of Providence , which once cast their deep shade on his chequered path , are vindicated and explained . He has joined “ the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and an innumerable company of angels , and God , the judge of all , and the spirits of just men made perfect , and Jesus , the Mediator of the new covenant . ” There , freed from the sorrows and finite conceptions of erring reason , he unites with the redeemed of the Lord in that nobler song of praise , “ Unto Him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood , and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen . ”</p>

   <p>BRIEF ACCOUNT OF MADAME GUION ,</p>
   <p>AND OF</p>
   <p>THE MYSTIC WRITERS .</p>
   <p>The mystic writers , though the object of so much public attention in France , towards the close of the seventeenth century , have never attracted much notice in this country , and are known rather as a matter of historical fact than of personal interest . It is to Cowper that we are indebted for the translation of the Hymns of Madame Guion , the founder , or rather reviver , of the Mystics ; for it is evident from ecclesiastical history that they existed so early as in the third and fourth centuries , and that the habits of profound contemplation and retirement from the world , in which they indulged , led to the monastic seclusion of which St. Anthony was the most eminent example . Dionysius the Areopagite is , however , generally considered to be the founder of this sect in the fourth century . Macarius and Hilarion are also included among its supporters . The celebrated Thomas à Kempis , in the fifteenth century , adopted a kind of purified mysticism . Molino , a Spanish priest , though resident at Rome , still further extended these views ; till at length Madame Guion , in the reign of Louis XIV . embodied them in their present form , which is known in France under the name of Quietism , from the calm repose and indifference to external objects which is characteristic of these principles .</p>
   <p>The Mystics professed to elevate the soul above all sensible and terrestrial objects , and to unite it to the Deity in an ineffable manner ; to inculcate a pure and absolutely disinterested love of God , for his own sake , and on account of his adorable perfections ; to maintain a close and intimate communion with him by mortifying all the senses , by a profound submission to his will , even under the consciousness of perdition , and by an internal sanctity of heart , strengthened by a holy and sublime contemplation . We shall shortly examine this system , and inquire how far this indifference to salvation , from a supposed conformity to the will of God , is founded either on reason or Scripture ; and whether the pure love of God , independent of his love to us , and of our personal interest in the blessings of redemption , is a state of mind to be generally attained .</p>
   <p>But we shall first advert to the manner in which Madame Guoion was led to embrace these views , and illustrate them by a reference to her own writings . After endeavouring , by unceasing efforts , and many acts of external piety , to raise her mind to a high tone of religious perfection , without being able to attain it , she meets with an ecclesiastic of the order of St. Francis , and requests him to explain the cause of this failure . His reply , and the remarkable consequences by which it was followed , is thus recorded by herself in the narrative of her own life . “ It is , madam , because you seek WITHOUT what you have WITHIN . Accustom yourself to seek God in your heart , and you will there find him . ”</p>
   <p>“ Having said these words , he left me . They were to me like the stroke of a dart , which penetrated through my heart . I felt at this instant a very deep wound , a wound so delightful that I desired not to be cured . These words brought into my heart what I had been seeking so many years ; or rather , they discovered to me what was there , and which I had not enjoyed for want of knowing it . Oh my Lord ! thou wast in my heart , and demandedst only a simple turning of my mind inward , to make me perceive thy presence . Oh infinite Goodness ! How was I running hither and thither to seek thee ; my life was a burden to me , though my happiness was in myself . I was poor in the midst of riches , and ready to perish with hunger , near a table plentifully spread , and a continual feast . Oh Beauty , ancient and new ! Why have I known thee so late ! Alas ! I sought thee where thou wast not , and did not seek thee where thou wast . It was for want of understanding these words of thy gospel , ‘ The kingdom of God cometh not with observation : neither shall they say , Lo here , or Lo there . For behold the kingdom of God is within you . ’ This I experienced ; for thou becamest my king , and my heart thy kingdom , wherein thou didst reign supreme , and perform all thy sacred will . ”</p>
   <p>Hours , she observes , now passed away like moments , and she could hardly do any thing else but pray . She enters at the same time upon a strict course of penances , deprives herself of the most innocent indulgences , and succeeds so far that she could scarcely prefer one thing to another . Her senses are severely mortified , and kept under uniform restraint . She aims at nothing less than the death of the senses , and the utter extinction of self . “ It is only by a total death to self , ” she remarks , “ that we can be lost in God . ”</p>
   <p>At length these continual efforts become painful to her , and she is far from realizing either inward peace or the grace of true holiness . In describing her state of mind , she observes :</p>
   <p>“ I began to experience an insupportable weight , in that very piety which had formerly been so easy and delightful to me ; not that I did not love it extremely , but I found myself defective in that noble practice of it to which I aspired . The more I loved it , the more I laboured to acquire what I saw I failed in . But alas ! I seemed continually to be overcome by that which was contrary to it . My heart , indeed , was detached from all sensual pleasures . For these several years past it has seemed to me that my mind is so detached and absent from the body , that I do things as if I did them not . If I eat or refresh myself , it is done with such an absence , or separation , as I wonder at , and with an entire mortification of the keenness of sensation in all the natural functions . ”</p>
   <p>In addition to this dissatisfaction with herself , it is her lot to be married to a man who is strongly opposed to her views and principles . Her domestic trials aggravate her wretchedness , and she enjoys peace neither in herself , in others , nor in God .</p>
   <p>“ I could now no longer pray as formerly . Heaven seemed shut to me , and I thought justly too . I could get no consolation , nor make any complaint thereupon ; nor had I any creature on earth to apply to , or to whom I might impart my condition . I found myself banished from all beings , without finding a support or refuge in any thing . I could no more practise any virtue with facility . Such as had formerly been familiar to me seemed now to have left me . ‘ Alas ! ’ said I , ‘ is it possible that this heart , formerly all on fire , should now become like ice ? ’ Laden with a weight of past sins , and a multitude of new ones , I could not think God would ever pardon me , but looked on myself as a victim of hell . Whatever I tried for a remedy , seemed only to increase the malady . I may say that tears were my drink , and sorrow my food . I had within myself an executioner who tortured me without respite . ”</p>
   <p>We believe the case of Madame Guion to be by no means singular . Many aim at high attainments in religion , with the utmost sincerity of intention , but , being ignorant of the true way of peace , to which a more scriptural view would infallibly lead them , they load the conscience with heavy burdens , till it sinks under the weight of the oppression . Peace of mind is not to be found in self-inflicted austerities , in overstrained efforts , nor even in the way of internal holiness . This is seeking the living among the dead . We first find God , not by what we try to do for ourselves , but in a firm reliance on what Christ the Lord has done for us . “ He was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities ; the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stripes we are healed . ” This is the only true ground of acceptance . This is the foundation laid in Zion . “ He is our peace . ” Holiness follows , but does not go before ; it is the effect , but not the cause . Mysticism inverts the order , and seems to give more honour to the sanctifying Spirit , than to a crucified Saviour and Redeemer .</p>
   <p>However specious , therefore , the counsel given by the priest might seem to be , and powerfully as she was impressed by it for a season , yet it failed in imparting the whole truth . He led her to derive peace from contemplating Christ within ; but true peace can flow only from contemplating Christ without . The “ water ” and the “ blood ” are emblematical of a double operation . Each is necessary , Christ in the heart for sanctification , Christ on the cross for justification and pardon of sin . To neglect the latter , and to fix our inmost thoughts on the former only , what is it but to make a Saviour of sanctification , and to render the cross of none effect ?</p>
   <p>In the midst of her internal disquietude , the husband of Madame Guion dies . “ At last , ” she writes , “ after having passed twelve years and four months in the crosses of marriage , as great as possible , except poverty , which I never knew , though I had much desired it , God drew me out of that state to give me still stronger crosses to bear , and of such a nature as I had never met with before . ”</p>
   <p>Her life from this period was a continual scene of trials and persecutions , to which her views and principles uniformly exposed her .</p>
   <p>Relieved now from all external restraint , this devoted woman dedicates herself to the Lord by a solemn surrender , which she calls a marriage contract , and engages to live wholly to him and to his glory for the remainder of her days .</p>
   <p>Her state of mind , and the joy and happiness which it led to , are thus expressed .</p>
   <p>“ At this time I found that I had the perfect chastity of love to God , mine being without any reserve , division , or view of interest ;— perfect poverty , by the total privation of every thing that was mine both inwardly and outwardly ;— perfect obedience to the will of God , submission to the church , and honour to Jesus Christ in loving himself only . ”</p>
   <p>“ The joy which such a soul possesses in its God is so great , that it experiences the truth of those words of the royal prophet , ‘ All they who are in thee , O Lord , are like persons ravished with joy . ’ To such a soul the words of our Lord seem to be addressed , ‘ Your joy no man shall take from you . ’ John xvi . 22 . It is as it were plunged in a river of peace : its prayer is continual : nothing can hinder it from praying to God , or from loving him . It amply verifies these words in the Canticles , ‘ I sleep , but my heart waketh ; ’ for it finds that even sleep itself does not hinder it from praying . Oh , unutterable happiness ! Who could ever have thought that a soul , which seemed to be in the utmost misery , should ever find a happiness equal to this ? Oh happy poverty , happy loss , happy nothingness , which gives no less than God himself in his own immensity , no more circumscribed to the limited manner of the creature , but always drawing it out of that to plunge it wholly into his own divine essence .</p>
   <p>“ What then renders this soul so perfectly content ? It neither knows , nor wants to know any thing but what God calls it to . Herein it enjoys divine content , after a manner vast , immense , independent of exterior events ; more satisfied in its humiliation , and in the opposition of all creatures , by the order of Providence , than on the throne of its own choice .</p>
   <p>“ It is here that the apostolic life begins . But is every one called to that state ? Very few , indeed , as far as I can comprehend ; and of the few that are called to it fewer still walk in true purity . ”</p>
   <p>This entire surrender of the soul to God , or self-abandonment , she thus describes .</p>
   <p>“ Abandonment is a matter of the greatest importance in our process ; it is the key to the inner court ; so that whosoever knoweth truly how to abandon himself , soon becomes perfect . We must , therefore , continue stedfast and immoveable therein , nor listen to the voice of natural reason . Great faith produces great abandonment ; we must confide in God , ‘ hoping against hope . ’ ( Rom . iv . 18 . )</p>
   <p>“ Abandonment is the casting off all selfish care , that we may be altogether at the Divine disposal . All Christians are exhorted to this resignation ; for it is said to all , ‘ Take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or , what shall we drink ? or , wherewithal shall we be clothed ? for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things . ’ ( Matt . vi . 31 , 32 . ) ‘ In all thy ways acknowledge him , and he shall direct thy paths . ’ ( Prov . iii . 6 . ) ‘ Commit thy ways unto the Lord , and thy thoughts shall be established . ’ ( Prov . xvi . 3 . ) ‘ Commit thy way unto the Lord ; trust also in him , and he shall bring it to pass . ’ ( Psalm xxxvii . 5 . )</p>
   <p>“ Our abandonment then should be as fully applied to external as internal things , giving up all our concerns into the hands of God , forgetting ourselves , and thinking only of him ; by which the heart will remain always disengaged , free , and at peace . It is practised by continually losing our own will in the will of God ; by renouncing every particular inclination as soon as it arises , however good it may appear , that we may stand in indifference with respect to ourselves , and only will that which God from eternity had willed ; by being resigned in all things , whether for soul or body , whether for time or eternity ; by leaving what is past in oblivion , what is to come to Providence , and devoting the present moment to God , which brings with itself God 's eternal order , and it is as infallible a declaration to us of his will , as it is inevitable and common to all ; by attributing nothing that befalls us to the creature , but regarding all things in God , and looking upon all , excepting only our sins , as infallibly proceeding from him . Surrender yourselves , then , to be led and disposed of just as God pleaseth , with respect both to your outward and inward state . ”</p>
   <p>There is also another term , of frequent occurrence in Madame Guion 's writings , called the annihilation of the powers or senses , ( anéantissement des puissances ,) by which she means that all the senses and passions are to be completely mortified and suppressed , in order that the soul , freed from the heavy incumbrance , may aspire to full and unrestrained communion with God .</p>
   <p>Such is the outline of mysticism , which we have endeavoured to illustrate in her own words . Indiscriminate censure would be no less opposed to the real truth than indiscriminate praise .</p>
   <p>The proselytes made to this doctrine in France were numerous , consisting of names distinguished by their piety and rank . Among these , she had the honour of including the great Fénélon , who , though he had too much taste and judgment to adopt the extremes of her system , listened with delight when she descanted before him , at the Hôtel de Beauvilliers , on the pure and disinterested love of God .<span type="note_anchor">[ 915 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 915 ]</span>Life of Fénélon .</p>
   <p>It was in vain that the celebrated Bishop of Meaux<span type="note_anchor">[ 916 ]</span>exposed her doctrines with all the powers of his wit , aided by the splendour of his eloquence . Her persecutions awakened new interest . She was sent to the castle of Vincennes , as if she had been a prisoner of state .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 916 ]</span>Bossuet .</p>
   <p>There she employed her lonely hours in pouring out the effusions of her heart , in hymns expressive of her love to God , and of the fervour of her devotion . Some of these compositions , written under circumstances so interesting , we shall present to the reader . They are indebted for their English dress to the poet Cowper , and to the suggestion of the Rev . Mr. Bull of Newport Pagnell , who conceived that the spirit which they breathe could not fail to be congenial to a mind like his .</p>
   <p>We shall now venture to offer a few remarks on this system .</p>
   <p>What we admire in Madame Guion is , the purity of her heart , its incessant aspirations after holiness , its secret and close communion with God . These are qualifications in which there is reason to believe that the great bulk of professing Christians are greatly deficient . Religion , even among reflecting minds , partakes more of a philosophical than a spiritual character . The fire is in the intellect , the ice is in the heart . In the social circle , the essay , or review , how often is spiritual religion branded with the title of enthusiasm , and the wings of devotion clipped , lest she should soar with too lofty an elevation , and pass beyond the limits which a cold and calculating policy would prescribe .</p>
   <p>Among others again , who are the professed followers of Christ , how far do all fall short in the sublime and devotional feeling of love to God ! The higher attainments of Christian piety , the inward fervency of spirit , and the entire surrender of the soul , are not sufficiently realized . Men do not rise to the elevation of Bible Christianity . Religion is considered too much in the light of a struggle and a warfare , and too little as a state of inward repose and joy unspeakable and full of glory .</p>
   <p>It is in this respect that we think the devotional spirit of Madame Guion may be contemplated with profit , if by a wise discrimination we can adopt what is excellent , and reject what is overstrained , legal , and visionary .</p>
   <p>There is , however , a familiarity in her addresses to the Deity incompatible with the reverence due to a sense of his majesty and greatness . In exposing this objectionable part of her writings , Bossuet beautifully apostrophizes the seraphs , and entreats them to bring burning coals from the altar to purify his lips , lest they should have been defiled by the impurities which he had been obliged to record .<span type="note_anchor">[ 917 ]</span></p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 917 ]</span>See Butler 's Life of Fenelon .</p>
   <p>With respect to the distinguishing feature of mysticism , the pure and disinterested love of God , for his own sake , and without any consideration of self , that the mind may , at particular seasons , rise to this degree of holy contemplation , we believe to be possible ; but we are persuaded that such a state of feeling cannot be habitually sustained , and that it is beyond the general standard and capacities of human nature . God 's love to us is recorded in the Scripture as the foundation of our love to him :— “ We love him , because he first loved us . ” Even glorified spirits , whose devotion we may justly suppose to have attained its highest degree of perfection , are represented as making their own salvation the theme of adoring gratitude and praise . “ For thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood , and hast made us unto our God kings and priests . ” Besides , it is in the great work of redemption that the divine attributes are so gloriously displayed ; that the most affecting appeals are made to our fears and hopes ; and the most animating motives held forth for our obedience . Man 's personal interest is therefore so interwoven with the display of the divine perfections , that the former can never be excluded without obscuring the glory of the very attributes which mysticism requires us to adore .</p>
   <p>Again , the doctrine of the Mystics proposes the utter suppression of the passions of hope and fear ; the annihilation , as it is called , of all our natural feelings , and an entire abstraction from the world .</p>
   <p>The annihilation of our natural feelings , that the heart may be wholly filled with the love and contemplation of the Deity , is not possible , nor , if it were possible , would it be desirable , as we should cease , in that case , to be men , without acquiring the nature of angels . It is not the suppression , but the due control and consecration of our feelings to the purest ends that the Bible proposes ; not the exclusion of what is human , but the admixture of what is divine . The apostles , though gifted with the Holy Ghost from heaven , were still “ men of like passions with ourselves , ” and the Saviour who was transfigured on Mount Tabor , thirsted at the well of Sychar , and wept at the grave of Lazarus .</p>
   <p>Nor is it abstraction from the world , but from its spirit , that the Bible enjoins as a duty on the Christian . “ Let us open this wonderful book , ” observes an elegant writer , “ where we may , we meet no mystical abstraction . We feel our whole mind to be addressed at once ; no faculty , active or passive , being left without its provision . Human nature is every where made to furnish the machinery , which may work most effectually on itself . To withdraw the mind from sensible ideas while reading the Bible , is absolutely impossible . It places real life before us , in all its most interesting and most impressive forms ; and obliges us to converse with ‘ men of like passions with ourselves , ’ even while it is teaching us the way of God most perfectly .</p>
   <p>“ Instead of abstracting us from the world , it makes it a school of wisdom to us ; and teaches us , by example as well as precept , to proceed in making it so daily to ourselves . We discover that while it is the scene of the devil 's temptations , it is also the scene of God 's providence ; and that , as on the former account we must be ever vigilant against its seductions , so , on the latter account , we cannot but be deeply interested in its various movements , past , present , and future . To be regardless of these would be to overlook the volume of prophecy , as well as that kingdom of the Messiah upon earth , of whose gradual advancement the prophetic oracles chiefly treat , and in whose final triumph all their brightest rays concentre . It is not , therefore , a mystical escape from the world to which the Christian is called . His vocation is much more glorious ; he is to keep himself ‘ unspotted from the world ; ’ but he is to remain in it , that he may maintain , as far as in him lies , his Lord 's right to it , and promote his interest in it . He is taught this by the Redeemer 's last prayer for his followers : ‘ I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil . ’ And he is still more fully instructed by our Lord 's own example ; who made every walk of human life the scene of his beneficence , and turned every object and occurrence into a means of the most interesting and deepest instruction .

   <p>There is one more feature in mysticism entitled to be considered , because it was subsequently adopted by Fenelon , viz . the possibility of the soul acquiescing in its own destruction , if such were the will of God , from a profound submission to his will and a desire to promote his glory . But this supposition involves a manifest absurdity , because a profound submission to the will of God is a gracious principle , and how can the soul , which is under gracious impressions , ever be the object of perdition , or God be glorified in its destruction ? The case of Moses , who prayed to be blotted out of the book which God had written , if the Israelites might be spared ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 919 ]</span>or that of St. Paul , who wished that he might be accursed , for the sake of his brethren , according to the flesh ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 920 ]</span>— these passages might be quoted ; but they are to be considered as referring to the present and not to the future life , in reference to the latter of which they would be obviously repugnant to the justice and goodness of God .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 919 ]</span>Exodus xxxii . 32 .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 920 ]</span>Scott and Henry both agree in this interpretation , viz . a willingness to be treated as an Anathema , and to be cut off from all church communion and privileges , but not to be eternally lost .</p>
   <p>It is evident from what has been said , that the religious views of Madame Guion , excellent as they were in their principle , in so far as they inculcated the supreme love of God , profound submission to his will , the calm retirement of the soul , and deadness to the spirit of the world , were nevertheless too overstrained to be suited to the character and constitution of human nature . Wesley translated her life , and observes , “ Such another Life as that of Madam Guion , I doubt whether the world ever saw . It contains an abundance of excellent things , uncommonly excellent ; several things which are utterly false and unscriptural ; nay , such as are dangerously false . As to Madam Guion herself , I believe she was not only a good woman , but good in an eminent degree ; deeply devoted to God , and often favoured with uncommon communications of his Spirit . ”</p>
   <p>The persecutions in which she was thus involved were unremitting and painful . Her doctrines underwent a solemn inquiry at Issy , before three commissioners appointed by Louis XIV . for that purpose : viz . the Bishop of Meaux , the Bishop of Chartres , ( afterwards Cardinal de Noailles ,) and M. Tronson , the Superior of the congregation of St. Sulpice . After a discussion which lasted six months , her writings received a formal condemnation , in which Fenelon refused to concur . By this apparent sanction of her principles , and still more by his celebrated “ Maxims of the Saints , ” in which he incorporated the more spiritual part of her system , he exposed himself to a series of painful reverses . He was banished the court by Louis XIV ., who probably never read his book , nor comprehended his principles , but who never forgave the author of Telemachus . By the same authority he was removed from the office of preceptor to the Dukes of Burgundy , Anjou , and Berri ; and commanded to retire to Cambray , which he embellished with his exalted virtues . But a further scene of humiliation awaited him . His powerful opponent , the celebrated Bossuet , not content with attacking his writings , endeavoured to procure their condemnation at the court of Rome , which led to a bon-mot of the Pope , that “ Fenelon was in fault for too great love to God , and his enemies equally in fault for too little love of their neighbour . ” The Brief was at length obtained , though not without considerable delay and reluctance . Fenelon received this act of censure with calm serenity , and in obedience to papal authority , ascended his pulpit at Cambray with his Maxims in one hand and the Brief in the other . He then read the condemnation of his own book , amidst the tears and admiration of his congregation ; thus evincing a magnanimity which rendered him greater in his defeat than his enemies appeared in their triumph .</p>
   <p>Madame Guion spent ten years in prison , during which she composed many hymns , with poems on various spiritual subjects , filling no less than five octavo volumes . Speaking of the period of her imprisonment at Vincennes , she observes , “ I passed my time in great peace , content to spend the rest of my life there , if such were the will of God . I sang songs of joy , which the maid who served me learned by heart , as fast as I made them : and we sang together thy praises , O my God ! The stones of my prison looked in my eyes like rubies . I esteemed them more than all the gaudy brilliancies of a vain world . ” We cannot state this fact without doing homage to the virtues of Madame Guion . The piety that could convert a prison into a sanctuary , and transform sufferings into an occasion for joy and thanksgiving , must have been elevated and sincere , however mingled with enthusiasm . Her doctrine of profound submission , under circumstances the most adverse , was no speculative thesis ; it was evidently carried into the life and practice .</p>
   <p>Who is not reminded by this act of what is recorded in the apostolical times ? “ And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed , and sang praises unto God . ” The rigour of her persecutions , in our opinion , conveys a strong censure against her zealous but misguided opponents . But the case is by no means solitary . The world is always indulgent to the errors of our practice , but severe to the errors of our creed . True policy and humanity would have suggested a different course . Extravagances , when left to themselves , generally work their own cure ; but , when visited with persecution , acquire dignity and importance , and never fail to awaken sympathy for the sufferers .</p>
   <p>After her long imprisonment , Madam Guion lived a retired life for more than seven years at Blois , where she died June 9 , 1717 , in the seventieth year of her age , celebrated for her misfortunes and devotion , though her principles , which once convulsed France , and awakened the thunders of the Vatican , are now nearly forgotten .</p>
   <p>The following selection from her poems , executed by Cowper , is highly devotional , and may be read with interest and edification . It exhibits a happy specimen of her religious views in their best form ; and Cowper has given to them the charms of versification , united with a taste and discrimination that ensure their popularity . The poem on the Nativity is a sublime and bold composition , and proves that the piety which warms the heart , seldom fails to enlarge and invigorate the faculties of the mind .</p>

     <l n="4">Enchant no longer this indifferent heart ;</l>
     <l n="5">The Lord of all things , in his humble birth ,</l>
     <l n="6">Makes mean the proud magnificence of earth ;</l>

     <l n="8">Eclipse its lustre ; and I scorn it all .</l>
     <l n="9">Canals , and fountains , and delicious vales ,</l>

     <l n="25">All , all have lost the charms they once possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="26">An infant God reigns sovereign in my breast ;</l>
     <l n="27">From Bethlehem 's bosom I no more will rove ;</l>
     <l n="28">There dwells the Saviour , and there rests my love .</l>
     <l n="29">Ye mightier rivers , that , with sounding force ,</l>
     <l n="30">Urge down the valleys your impetuous course !</l>
     <l n="31">Winds , clouds , and lightnings ! and , ye waves , whose heads ,</l>
     <l n="32">Curl 'd into monstrous forms , the seaman dreads !</l>
     <l n="33">Horrid abyss , where all experience fails ,</l>

     <l n="42">Whom all the aquatic world with terror eyes !</l>
     <l n="43">Had I but faith immoveable and true ,</l>
     <l n="44">I might defy the fiercest storm , like you :</l>

     <l n="51">Thou moon , whose car , encompassing the skies ,</l>
     <l n="52">Restores lost nature to our wondering eyes ;</l>
     <l n="53">Again retiring , when the brighter sun</l>
     <l n="54">Begins the course he seems in haste to run !</l>
     <l n="55">Behold him where he shines ! His rapid rays ,</l>
     <l n="56">Themselves unmeasured , measure all our days ;</l>
     <l n="57">Nothing impedes the race he would pursue ,</l>
     <l n="58">Nothing escapes his penetrating view ,</l>
     <l n="59">A thousand lands confess his quickening heat ,</l>
     <l n="60">And all he cheers are fruitful , fair , and sweet .</l>
     <l n="61">Far from enjoying what these scenes disclose ,</l>
     <l n="62">I feel the thorn , alas ! but miss the rose :</l>
     <l n="63">Too well I know this aching heart requires</l>
     <l n="64">More solid gold to fill its vast desires ;</l>

     <l n="66">Who call 'd them out of deep primeval night ;</l>
     <l n="67">Their form and beauty but augment my woe ,</l>
     <l n="68">I seek the Giver of those charms they show :</l>
     <l n="69">Nor , Him beside , throughout the world he made ,</l>

     <l n="72">Whose glory makes a blot of yonder sun ;</l>
     <l n="73">Compar 'd with thine , how dim his beauty seems ,</l>
     <l n="74">How quench 'd the radiance of his golden beams !</l>
     <l n="75">Thou art my bliss , the light by which I move ;</l>
     <l n="76">In thee alone dwells all that I can love .</l>
     <l n="77">All darkness flies when thou art pleased to appear ,</l>

     <l n="80">The watchful guardians of our heedless race ;</l>
     <l n="81">Thy various creatures in one strain agree ,</l>
     <l n="82">All , in all times and places , speak of thee ;</l>

     <l n="84">Attempt thy praise , and join the general song .</l>
     <l n="85">Almighty Former of this wondrous plan ,</l>
     <l n="86">Faintly reflected in thine image , man —</l>
     <l n="87">Holy and just — the greatness of whose name</l>
     <l n="88">Fills and supports this universal frame ,</l>
     <l n="89">Diffused throughout the infinitude of space ,</l>
     <l n="90">Who art thyself thine own vast dwelling place ;</l>
     <l n="91">Soul of our soul , whom yet no sense of ours</l>
     <l n="92">Discerns , eluding our most active powers ;</l>
     <l n="93">Encircling shades attend thine awful throne ,</l>
     <l n="94">That veil thy face , and keep thee still unknown ;</l>
     <l n="95">Unknown , though dwelling in our inmost part ,</l>
     <l n="96">Lord of the thoughts , and Sovereign of the heart !</l>
     <l n="97">Repeat the charming truth that never tires ,</l>
     <l n="98">No God is like the God my soul desires ;</l>
     <l n="99">He at whose voice heaven trembles , even He ,</l>
     <l n="100">Great as he is , knows how to stoop to me —</l>
     <l n="101">Lo ! there he lies — that smiling infant said ,</l>
     <l n="102">“ Heaven , earth , and sea , exist ! ” — and they obey 'd .</l>
     <l n="103">E'en he , whose being swells beyond the skies ,</l>
     <l n="104">Is born of woman , lives , and mourns , and dies ;</l>
     <l n="105">Eternal and immortal , seems to cast</l>
     <l n="106">That glory from his brows , and breathes his last .</l>
     <l n="107">Trivial and vain the works that man has wrought ,</l>
     <l n="108">How do they shrink and vanish at the thought !</l>
     <l n="109">Sweet solitude , and scene of my repose !</l>
     <l n="110">This rustic sight assuages all my woes —</l>
     <l n="111">That crib contains the Lord , whom I adore ;</l>
     <l n="112">And earth 's a shade that I pursue no more .</l>
     <l n="113">He is my firm support , my rock , my tower ,</l>
     <l n="114">I dwell secure beneath his sheltering power ,</l>
     <l n="115">And hold this mean retreat for ever dear ,</l>
     <l n="116">For all I love , my soul 's delight is here .</l>
     <l n="117">I see the Almighty swathed in infant bands ,</l>
     <l n="118">Tied helpless down the thunder-bearer 's hands !</l>
     <l n="119">And , in this shed , that mystery discern ,</l>
     <l n="120">Which faith and love , and they alone , can learn .</l>
     <l n="121">Ye tempests , spare the slumbers of your Lord !</l>
     <l n="122">Ye zephyrs , all your whisper 'd sweets afford !</l>
     <l n="123">Confess the God , that guides the rolling year ;</l>
     <l n="124">Heaven , do him homage ; and thou , earth , revere !</l>
     <l n="125">Ye shepherds , monarchs , sages , hither bring</l>
     <l n="126">Your hearts an offering , and adore your King !</l>
     <l n="127">Pure be those hearts , and rich in faith and love ;</l>
     <l n="128">Join , in his praise , the harmonious world above ;</l>
     <l n="129">To Bethlehem haste , rejoice in his repose ,</l>
     <l n="130">And praise him there for all that he bestows !</l>
     <l n="131">Man , busy man , alas ! can ill afford</l>
     <l n="132">To obey the summons , and attend the Lord ;</l>
     <l n="133">Perverted reason revels and runs wild ,</l>
     <l n="134">By glittering shows of pomp and wealth beguiled ;</l>
     <l n="135">And , blind to genuine excellence and grace ,</l>
     <l n="136">Finds not her author in so mean a place .</l>
     <l n="137">Ye unbelieving ! learn a wiser part ,</l>
     <l n="138">Distrust your erring sense , and search your heart ;</l>
     <l n="139">There soon ye shall perceive a kindling flame</l>
     <l n="140">Glow for that infant God , from whom it came ;</l>
     <l n="141">Resist not , quench not , that divine desire ,</l>
     <l n="142">Melt all your adamant in heavenly fire !</l>
     <l n="143">Not so will I requite thee , gentle love !</l>
     <l n="144">Yielding and soft this heart shall ever prove ;</l>
     <l n="145">And every heart beneath thy power should fall ,</l>
     <l n="146">Glad to submit , could mine contain them all .</l>
     <l n="147">But I am poor , oblation I have none ,</l>
     <l n="148">None for a Saviour , but himself alone :</l>
     <l n="149">Whate'er I render thee , from thee it came :</l>
     <l n="150">And , if I give my body to the flame ,</l>
     <l n="151">My patience , love , and energy divine</l>
     <l n="152">Of heart , and soul , and spirit , all are thine .</l>
     <l n="153">Ah , vain attempt to expunge the mighty score !</l>
     <l n="154">The more I pay , I owe thee still the more .</l>
     <l n="155">Upon my meanness , poverty , and guilt ,</l>
     <l n="156">The trophy of thy glory shall be built ;</l>
     <l n="157">My self-disdain shall be the unshaken base ,</l>
     <l n="158">And my deformity its fairest grace ;</l>
     <l n="159">For destitute of good , and rich in ill ,</l>
     <l n="160">Must be my state and my description still .</l>
     <l n="161">And do I grieve at such an humbling lot ?</l>
     <l n="162">Nay , but I cherish and enjoy the thought —</l>
     <l n="163">Vain pageantry and pomp of earth , adieu !</l>
     <l n="164">I have no wish , no memory for you ;</l>
     <l n="165">The more I feel my misery , I adore</l>
     <l n="166">The sacred inmate of my soul the more ;</l>
     <l n="167">Rich in his love , I feel my noblest pride</l>
     <l n="168">Spring from the sense of having nought beside .</l>
     <l n="169">In Thee I find wealth , comfort , virtue , might ;</l>
     <l n="170">My wanderings prove thy wisdom infinite ;</l>
     <l n="171">All that I have I give thee ; and then see</l>
     <l n="172">All contrarieties unite in thee ;</l>
     <l n="173">For thou hast join 'd them , taking up our woe ,</l>
     <l n="174">And pouring out thy bliss on worms below ,</l>
     <l n="175">By filling with thy grace and love divine</l>
     <l n="176">A gulf of evil in this heart of mine .</l>
     <l n="177">This is , indeed , to bid the valleys rise ,</l>
     <l n="178">And the hills sink — ‘ tis matching earth and skies ;</l>
     <l n="179">I feel my weakness , thank thee , and deplore</l>
     <l n="180">An aching heart , that throbs to thank thee more ;</l>
     <l n="181">The more I love thee , I the more reprove</l>
     <l n="182">A soul so lifeless , and so slow to love ;</l>
     <l n="183">Till , on a deluge of thy mercy toss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="184">I plunge into that sea , and there am lost .</l>

     <l n="26">And here my books — my life — absorb me whole .</l>
     <l n="27">Here too I visit , or to smile or weep ,</l>
     <l n="28">The winding theatre 's majestic sweep ;</l>
     <l n="29">The grave or gay colloquial scene recruits</l>
     <l n="30">My spirits , spent in learning 's long pursuits ;</l>
     <l n="31">Whether some senior shrewd , or spendthrift heir ,</l>
     <l n="32">Suitor , or soldier , now unarm 'd , be there ,</l>
     <l n="33">Or some coif 'd brooder o'er a ten years ’ cause ,</l>
     <l n="34">Thunder the Norman gibberish of the laws .</l>
     <l n="35">The lacquey , there , oft dupes the wary sire ,</l>
     <l n="36">And , artful , speeds the enamour 'd son 's desire .</l>
     <l n="37">There , virgins oft , unconscious what they prove ,</l>
     <l n="38">What love is know not , yet , unknowing , love .</l>
     <l n="39">Or , if impassion 'd tragedy wield high</l>
     <l n="40">The bloody sceptre , give her locks to fly ,</l>
     <l n="41">Wild as the winds , and roll her haggard eye ,</l>
     <l n="42">I gaze , and grieve , still cherishing my grief .</l>
     <l n="43">At times , e'en bitter tears yield sweet relief ,</l>
     <l n="44">As , when from bliss untasted torn away ,</l>
     <l n="45">Some youth dies , hapless , on his bridal day ;</l>
     <l n="46">Or when the ghost , sent back from shades below ,</l>
     <l n="47">Fills the assassin 's heart with vengeful woe ;</l>
     <l n="48">When Troy , or Argos , the dire scene affords ,</l>
     <l n="49">Or Creon 's hall laments its guilty lords .</l>
     <l n="50">Nor always city-pent , or pent at home ,</l>
     <l n="51">I dwell ; but , when spring calls me forth to roam ,</l>
     <l n="52">Expatiate in our proud suburban shades</l>
     <l n="53">Of branching elm that never sun pervades .</l>
     <l n="54">Here many a virgin troop I may descry ,</l>
     <l n="55">Like stars of mildest influence , gliding by .</l>
     <l n="56">Oh forms divine ! oh looks that might inspire</l>
     <l n="57">E'en Jove himself , grown old , with young desire ,</l>
     <l n="58">Oft have I gazed on gem-surpassing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="59">Out-sparkling every star that gilds the skies ;</l>
     <l n="60">Necks whiter than the ivory arm bestow 'd</l>
     <l n="61">By Jove on Pelops , or the milky road !</l>
     <l n="62">Bright locks , love 's golden snare ! these falling low ,</l>
     <l n="63">Those playing wanton o'er the graceful brow !</l>
     <l n="64">Cheeks , too , more winning sweet than after shower</l>
     <l n="65">Adonis turn 'd to Flora 's favourite flower !</l>
     <l n="66">Yield , heroines , yield , and ye who shared the embrace</l>
     <l n="67">Of Jupiter in ancient times , give place !</l>
     <l n="68">Give place , ye turban 'd fair of Persia 's coast !</l>
     <l n="69">And ye , not less renown 'd , Assyria 's boast !</l>
     <l n="70">Submit , ye nymphs of Greece ! ye , once the bloom</l>
     <l n="71">Of Ilion ! and all ye , of haughty Rome ,</l>
     <l n="72">Who swept , of old , her theatres with trains</l>
     <l n="73">Redundant , and still live in classic strains !</l>
     <l n="74">To British damsels beauty 's palm is due ;</l>
     <l n="75">Aliens ! to follow them is fame for you .</l>
     <l n="76">Oh city , founded by Dardanian hands ,</l>
     <l n="77">Whose towering front the circling realm commands ,</l>
     <l n="78">Too blest abode ! no loveliness we see</l>
     <l n="79">In all the earth , but it abounds in thee .</l>
     <l n="80">The virgin multitude that daily meets ,</l>
     <l n="81">Radiant with gold and beauty , in thy streets ,</l>
     <l n="82">Outnumbers all her train of starry fires</l>
     <l n="83">With which Diana gilds thy lofty spires .</l>
     <l n="84">Fame says that , wafted hither by her doves ,</l>
     <l n="85">With all her host of quiver-bearing loves ,</l>
     <l n="86">Venus , preferring Paphian scenes no more ,</l>
     <l n="87">Has fix 'd her empire on thy nobler shore .</l>
     <l n="88">But , lest the sightless boy enforce my stay ,</l>
     <l n="89">I leave these happy walls while yet I may .</l>
     <l n="90">Immortal Moly shall secure my heart</l>
     <l n="91">From all the sorcery of Circæan art ,</l>
     <l n="92">And I will e'en repass Cam 's reedy pools ,</l>
     <l n="93">To face once more the warfare of the schools .</l>
     <l n="94">Meantime accept this trifle ! rhymes though few ,</l>
     <l n="95">Yet such as prove thy friend 's remembrance true !</l>

     <l n="3">When first arose the image in my breast</l>
     <l n="4">Of England 's suffering by that scourge , the pest !</l>
     <l n="5">How Death , his funeral torch and scythe in hand ,</l>
     <l n="6">Entering the lordliest mansions of the land ,</l>
     <l n="7">Has laid the gem-illumined palace low ,</l>
     <l n="8">And levell 'd tribes of nobles at a blow .</l>
     <l n="9">I next deplored the famed paternal pair ,</l>

     <l n="11">The heroes next , whom snatch 'd into the skies ,</l>

     <l n="13">But thee far most I mourn 'd , regretted most ,</l>
     <l n="14">Winton 's chief shepherd , and her worthiest boast !</l>
     <l n="15">Pour 'd out in tears I thus complaining said :</l>
     <l n="16">“ Death , next in power to Him who rules the dead !</l>
     <l n="17">Is it not enough that all the woodlands yield</l>
     <l n="18">To thy fell force , and every verdant field ;</l>
     <l n="19">That lilies , at one noisome blast of thine ,</l>
     <l n="20">And e'en the Cyprian queen 's own roses pine ;</l>
     <l n="21">That oaks themselves , although the running rill</l>
     <l n="22">Suckle their roots , must wither at thy will ;</l>
     <l n="23">That all the winged nations , even those</l>
     <l n="24">Whose heaven-directed flight the future shows ,</l>
     <l n="25">And all the beasts that in dark forests stray ,</l>
     <l n="26">And all the herds of Proteus are thy prey .</l>

     <l n="28">Why stain thy hands with blood of human kind ?</l>
     <l n="29">Why take delight , with darts that never roam ,</l>
     <l n="30">To chase a heaven-born spirit from her home ? ”</l>
     <l n="31">While thus I mourn 'd , the star of evening stood ,</l>
     <l n="32">Now newly risen above the western flood ,</l>
     <l n="33">And Phoebus from his morning goal again</l>
     <l n="34">Had reach 'd the gulfs of the Iberian main .</l>
     <l n="35">I wish 'd repose , and , on my couch reclined ,</l>
     <l n="36">Took early rest , to night and sleep resign 'd :</l>
     <l n="37">When — oh for words to paint what I beheld !</l>
     <l n="38">I seem 'd to wander in a spacious field ,</l>
     <l n="39">Where all the champaign glow 'd with purple light ,</l>
     <l n="40">Like that of sunrise on the mountain height ;</l>
     <l n="41">Flowers over all the field , of every hue</l>
     <l n="42">That ever Iris wore , luxuriant grew .</l>
     <l n="43">Nor Chloris , with whom amorous Zephyrs play ,</l>
     <l n="44">E'er dress 'd Alcinous ’ garden half so gay .</l>
     <l n="45">A silver current , like the Tagus , roll 'd</l>
     <l n="46">O'er golden sands , but sands of purer gold ;</l>
     <l n="47">With dewy airs Favonius fann 'd the flowers ,</l>
     <l n="48">With airs awaken 'd under rosy bowers .</l>
     <l n="49">Such , poets feign , irradiated all o'er</l>
     <l n="50">The sun 's abode on India 's utmost shore .</l>
     <l n="51">While I that splendour , and the mingled shade</l>
     <l n="52">Of fruitful vines , with wonder fix 'd , survey 'd ,</l>
     <l n="53">At once , with looks that beam 'd celestial grace ,</l>
     <l n="54">The seer of Winton stood before my face .</l>
     <l n="55">His snowy vesture 's hem descending low ,</l>
     <l n="56">His golden sandals swept , and , pure as snow</l>
     <l n="57">New fallen , shone the mitre on his brow .</l>
     <l n="58">Where'er he trod , a tremulous sweet sound</l>
     <l n="59">Of gladness shook the flowery scene around :</l>
     <l n="60">Attendant angels clap their starry wings ,</l>
     <l n="61">The trumpet shakes the sky , all ether rings ;</l>
     <l n="62">Each chants his welcome , folds him to his breast ,</l>
     <l n="63">And thus a sweeter voice than all the rest :</l>
     <l n="64">“ Ascend , my son ! thy Father 's kingdom share !</l>
     <l n="65">My son ! henceforth be freed from every care ! ”</l>
     <l n="66">So spake the voice , and at its tender close</l>
     <l n="67">With psaltery 's sound the angelic band arose ;</l>
     <l n="68">Then night retired , and , chased by dawning day ,</l>
     <l n="69">The visionary bliss pass 'd all away .</l>
     <l n="70">I mourn 'd my banish 'd sleep with fond concern ;</l>
     <l n="71">Frequent to me may dreams like this return !</l>

     <l n="7">With Doris and her nymphs , and all the throng</l>
     <l n="8">Of azure gods , to speed thee safe along .</l>
     <l n="9">But rather , to ensure thy happier haste ,</l>

     <l n="19">My friend , and favourite inmate of my heart ,</l>
     <l n="20">That now is forced to want its better part !</l>
     <l n="21">What mountains now , and seas , alas ! how wide !</l>
     <l n="22">From me this other , dearer self divide ,</l>
     <l n="23">Dear as the sage renown 'd for moral truth</l>
     <l n="24">To the prime spirit of the Attic youth !</l>
     <l n="25">Dear as the Stagyrite to Ammon 's son ,</l>

     <l n="63">From timid foes the lion turns away ,</l>

     <l n="77">Mars rests contented in his Thrace no more ,</l>
     <l n="78">But goads his steeds to fields of German gore ,</l>
     <l n="79">The ever verdant olive fades and dies ,</l>
     <l n="80">And Peace , the trumpet-hating goddess , flies ,</l>
     <l n="81">Flies from that earth which justice long had left ,</l>

     <l n="105">Grim war indeed on every side appears ,</l>

     <l n="117">Of hoofs , and wheels , and neighings from afar ,</l>
     <l n="118">Of clashing armour , and the din of war .</l>

     <l n="1">Time , never wandering from his annual round ,</l>
     <l n="2">Bids zephyr breathe the spring , and thaw the ground ;</l>
     <l n="3">Bleak winter flies , new verdure clothes the plain ,</l>
     <l n="4">And earth assumes her transient youth again .</l>
     <l n="5">Dream I , or also to the spring belong</l>
     <l n="6">Increase of genius , and new powers of song ?</l>
     <l n="7">Spring gives them , and , how strange soe'er it seems ,</l>
     <l n="8">Impels me now to some harmonious themes .</l>
     <l n="9">Castalia 's fountain , and the forked hill</l>
     <l n="10">By day , by night , my raptured fancy fill ;</l>
     <l n="11">My bosom burns and heaves , I hear within</l>
     <l n="12">A sacred sound that prompts me to begin .</l>
     <l n="13">Lo ! Phoebus comes , with his bright hair he blends</l>
     <l n="14">The radiant laurel wreath ; Phoebus descends !</l>
     <l n="15">I mount , and undepress 'd by cumbrous clay ,</l>
     <l n="16">Through cloudy regions win my easy way ;</l>
     <l n="17">Rapt through poetic shadowy haunts I fly :</l>
     <l n="18">The shrines all open to my dauntless eye ,</l>
     <l n="19">My spirit searches all the realms of light ,</l>
     <l n="20">And no Tartarean gulfs elude my sight .</l>
     <l n="21">But this ecstatic trance — this glorious storm</l>
     <l n="22">Of inspiration — what will it perform ?</l>
     <l n="23">Spring claims the verse that with his influence glows ,</l>
     <l n="24">And shall be paid with what himself bestows .</l>
     <l n="25">Thou , veil 'd with opening foliage , lead'st the throng</l>
     <l n="26">Of feather 'd minstrels , Philomel ! in song ;</l>
     <l n="27">Let us , in concert , to the season sing ,</l>
     <l n="28">Civic and sylvan heralds of the spring !</l>
     <l n="29">With notes triumphant spring 's approach declare !</l>
     <l n="30">To spring , ye muses , annual tribute bear !</l>
     <l n="31">The Orient left , and Ethiopia 's plains ,</l>
     <l n="32">The sun now northward turns his golden reins ;</l>
     <l n="33">Night creeps not now ; yet rules with gentle sway ,</l>
     <l n="34">And drives her dusky horrors swift away ;</l>
     <l n="35">Now less fatigued , on this ethereal plain</l>
     <l n="36">Boötes follows his celestial wain ;</l>
     <l n="37">And now the radiant sentinels above ,</l>
     <l n="38">Less numerous , watch around the courts of Jove ,</l>
     <l n="39">For , with the night , force , ambush , slaughter fly ,</l>
     <l n="40">And no gigantic guilt alarms the sky .</l>
     <l n="41">Now , haply says some shepherd , while he views ,</l>
     <l n="42">Recumbent on a rock , the reddening dews ,</l>
     <l n="43">This night , this , surely , Phoebus miss 'd the fair ,</l>
     <l n="44">Who stops his chariot by her amorous care .</l>
     <l n="45">Cynthia , delighted by the morning 's glow ,</l>
     <l n="46">Speeds to the woodland , and resumes her bow ;</l>
     <l n="47">Resigns her beams , and , glad to disappear ,</l>
     <l n="48">Blesses his aid , who shortens her career .</l>
     <l n="49">Come — Phoebus cries — Aurora , come — too late</l>
     <l n="50">Thou lingerest , slumbering , with thy wither 'd mate ;</l>
     <l n="51">Leave him , and to Hymettus ’ top repair !</l>
     <l n="52">Thy darling Cephalus expects thee there .</l>
     <l n="53">The goddess with a blush her love betrays ,</l>
     <l n="54">But mounts , and , driving rapidly , obeys .</l>
     <l n="55">Earth now desires thee , Phoebus ! and , to engage</l>
     <l n="56">Thy warm embrace , casts off the guise of age ;</l>
     <l n="57">Desires thee , and deserves ; for who so sweet</l>
     <l n="58">When her rich bosom courts thy genial heat ?</l>
     <l n="59">Her breath imparts to every breeze that blows</l>
     <l n="60">Arabia 's harvest and the Paphian rose .</l>
     <l n="61">Her lofty front she diadems around</l>
     <l n="62">With sacred pines , like Ops on Ida crown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="63">Her dewy locks with various flowers new blown</l>
     <l n="64">She interweaves , various , and all her own ;</l>
     <l n="65">For Proserpine , in such a wreath attired ,</l>
     <l n="66">Tænarian Dis himself with love inspired .</l>
     <l n="67">Fear not , lest , cold and coy , the nymph refuse !</l>
     <l n="68">Herself , with all her sighing zephyrs , sues ;</l>
     <l n="69">Each courts thee , fanning soft his scented wing ,</l>
     <l n="70">And all her groves with warbled wishes ring .</l>
     <l n="71">Nor , unendow 'd and indigent , aspires</l>
     <l n="72">The amorous Earth to engage thy warm desires ,</l>
     <l n="73">But , rich in balmy drugs , assists thy claim ,</l>
     <l n="74">Divine Physician ! to that glorious name .</l>
     <l n="75">If splendid recompence , if gifts , can move</l>
     <l n="76">Desire in thee , ( gifts often purchase love ,)</l>
     <l n="77">She offers all the wealth her mountains hide ,</l>
     <l n="78">And all that rests beneath the boundless tide .</l>
     <l n="79">How oft , when headlong from the heavenly steep</l>
     <l n="80">She sees thee playing in the western deep ,</l>
     <l n="81">How oft she cries — “ Ah Phoebus , why repair</l>
     <l n="82">Thy wasted force , why seek refreshment there ?</l>
     <l n="83">Can Tethys win thee ? wherefore shouldst thou lave</l>
     <l n="84">A face so fair in her unpleasant wave ?</l>
     <l n="85">Come , seek my green retreats , and rather choose</l>
     <l n="86">To cool thy tresses in my crystal dews .</l>
     <l n="87">The grassy turf shall yield thee sweeter rest ;</l>
     <l n="88">Come , lay thy evening glories on my breast ,</l>
     <l n="89">And breathing fresh , through many a humid rose ,</l>
     <l n="90">Soft whispering airs shall lull thee to repose !</l>
     <l n="91">No fears I feel like Semele to die ,</l>
     <l n="92">Nor lest thy burning wheels approach too nigh ,</l>
     <l n="93">For thou canst govern them , here therefore rest ,</l>
     <l n="94">And lay thy evening glories on my breast ! ”</l>
     <l n="95">Thus breathes the wanton Earth her amorous flame ,</l>
     <l n="96">And all her countless offspring feel the same ;</l>
     <l n="97">For Cupid now through every region strays ,</l>
     <l n="98">Brightening his faded fires with solar rays ;</l>
     <l n="99">His new-strung bow sends forth a deadlier sound ,</l>
     <l n="100">And his new-pointed shafts more deeply wound ;</l>
     <l n="101">Nor Dian 's self escapes him now untried ,</l>
     <l n="102">Nor even Vesta at her altar-side ;</l>
     <l n="103">His mother too repairs her beauty 's wane ,</l>
     <l n="104">And seems sprung newly from the deep again .</l>
     <l n="105">Exulting youths the hymeneal sing ,</l>
     <l n="106">With Hymen 's name roofs , rocks , and valleys ring ;</l>
     <l n="107">He , new-attired , and by the season drest ,</l>
     <l n="108">Proceeds , all fragrant , in his saffron vest .</l>
     <l n="109">Now many a golden-cinctured virgin roves</l>
     <l n="110">To taste the pleasures of the fields and groves ,</l>
     <l n="111">All wish , and each alike , some favourite youth</l>
     <l n="112">Hers , in the bonds of hymeneal truth .</l>
     <l n="113">Now pipes the shepherd through his reeds again ,</l>
     <l n="114">Nor Phillis wants a song that suits the strain ;</l>
     <l n="115">With songs the seaman hails the starry sphere ,</l>
     <l n="116">And dolphins rise from the abyss to hear :</l>
     <l n="117">Jove feels himself the season , sports again</l>
     <l n="118">With his fair spouse , and banquets all his train .</l>
     <l n="119">Now too the satyrs , in the dusk of eve ,</l>
     <l n="120">Their mazy dance through flowery meadows weave ,</l>
     <l n="121">And , neither god nor goat , but both in kind ,</l>
     <l n="122">Silvanus , wreathed with cypress , skips behind .</l>
     <l n="123">The dryads leave their hollow sylvan cells</l>
     <l n="124">To roam the banks and solitary dells ;</l>
     <l n="125">Pan riots now ; and from his amorous chafe</l>
     <l n="126">Ceres and Cybele seem hardly safe ,</l>
     <l n="127">And Faunus , all on fire to reach the prize ,</l>
     <l n="128">In chase of some enticing oread flies ;</l>
     <l n="129">She bounds before , but fears too swift a bound ,</l>
     <l n="130">And hidden lies , but wishes to be found .</l>
     <l n="131">Our shades entice the immortals from above ,</l>
     <l n="132">And some kind power presides o'er every grove ;</l>
     <l n="133">And long , ye powers , o'er every grove preside ,</l>
     <l n="134">For all is safe , and blest , where ye abide !</l>
     <l n="135">Return , O Jove ! the age of gold restore —</l>
     <l n="136">Why choose to dwell where storms and thunder roar ?</l>
     <l n="137">At least thou , Phoebus ! moderate thy speed !</l>
     <l n="138">Let not the vernal hours too swift proceed ,</l>
     <l n="139">Command rough winter back , nor yield the pole</l>
     <l n="140">Too soon to night 's encroaching , long control !</l>

    <head>ELEGY VI .</head>
    <head>TO CHARLES DEODATI ,</head>
    <head>Who , while he spent his Christmas in the country , sent the Author a poetical epistle , in which he requested that his verses , if not so good as usual , might be excused on account of the many feasts to which his friends invited him , and which would not allow him leisure to finish them as he wished .</head>
     <l n="1">With no rich viands overcharged , I send</l>
     <l n="2">Health , which perchance you want , my pamper 'd friend .</l>
     <l n="3">But wherefore should thy muse tempt mine away</l>
     <l n="4">From what she loves , from darkness into day ?</l>
     <l n="5">Art thou desirous to be told how well</l>
     <l n="6">I love thee , and in verse ? verse cannot tell .</l>
     <l n="7">For verse has bounds , and must in measure move ;</l>
     <l n="8">But neither bounds nor measure knows my love .</l>
     <l n="9">How pleasant , in thy lines described , appear</l>
     <l n="10">December 's harmless sports and rural cheer !</l>
     <l n="11">French spirits kindling with cærulean fires ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all such gambols as the time inspires !</l>
     <l n="13">Think not that wine against good verse offends ,</l>
     <l n="14">The Muse and Bacchus have been always friends ;</l>
     <l n="15">Nor Phoebus blushes sometimes to be found</l>
     <l n="16">With ivy , rather than with laurel , crown 'd .</l>
     <l n="17">The Nine themselves ofttimes have join 'd the song</l>
     <l n="18">And revels of the Bacchanalian throng ;</l>
     <l n="19">Not even Ovid could in Scythian air</l>
     <l n="20">Sing sweetly — why ?— no vine would flourish there .</l>
     <l n="21">What in brief numbers sung Anacreon 's muse ?</l>
     <l n="22">Wine , and the rose that sparkling wine bedews .</l>
     <l n="23">Pindar with Bacchus glows — his every line</l>
     <l n="24">Breathes the rich fragrance of inspiring wine ,</l>
     <l n="25">While , with loud crash o'erturned , the chariot lies ,</l>
     <l n="26">And brown with dust the fiery courser flies .</l>
     <l n="27">The Roman lyrist steep 'd in wine his lays</l>
     <l n="28">So sweet in Glycera 's and Chloe 's praise .</l>
     <l n="29">Now too the plenteous feast and mantling bowl</l>
     <l n="30">Nourish the vigour of thy sprightly soul ;</l>
     <l n="31">The flowing goblet makes thy numbers flow ,</l>
     <l n="32">And casks not wine alone but verse bestow .</l>
     <l n="33">Thus Phoebus favours , and the arts attend ,</l>
     <l n="34">Whom Bacchus and whom Ceres both befriend .</l>
     <l n="35">What wonder , then , thy verses are so sweet ,</l>
     <l n="36">In which these triple powers so kindly meet !</l>
     <l n="37">The lute now also sounds , with gold inwrought ,</l>
     <l n="38">And , touch 'd with flying fingers nicely taught ,</l>
     <l n="39">In tapestried halls , high-roof 'd , the sprightly lyre</l>
     <l n="40">Directs the dancers of the virgin choir .</l>
     <l n="41">If dull repletion fright the muse away ,</l>
     <l n="42">Sights gay as these may more invite her stay ;</l>
     <l n="43">And , trust me , while the ivory keys resound ,</l>
     <l n="44">Fair damsels sport , and perfumes steam around ,</l>
     <l n="45">Apollo 's influence , like ethereal flame ,</l>
     <l n="46">Shall animate , at once , thy glowing frame ,</l>
     <l n="47">And all the muse shall rush into thy breast ,</l>
     <l n="48">By love and music 's blended powers possest .</l>
     <l n="49">For numerous powers light Elegy befriend ,</l>
     <l n="50">Hear her sweet voice , and at her call attend ;</l>
     <l n="51">Her , Bacchus , Ceres , Venus , all approve ,</l>
     <l n="52">And , with his blushing mother , gentle Love .</l>
     <l n="53">Hence to such bards we grant the copious use</l>
     <l n="54">Of banquets and the vine 's delicious juice .</l>
     <l n="55">But they who demigods and heroes praise ,</l>
     <l n="56">And feats perform 'd in Jove 's more youthful days ,</l>
     <l n="57">Who now the counsels of high heaven explore ,</l>
     <l n="58">Now shades that echo the Cerberean roar ,</l>
     <l n="59">Simply let these , like him of Samos , live ,</l>
     <l n="60">Let herbs to them a bloodless banquet give ;</l>
     <l n="61">In beechen goblets let their beverage shine ,</l>
     <l n="62">Cool from the crystal spring , their sober wine !</l>
     <l n="63">Their youth should pass in innocence secure</l>
     <l n="64">From stain licentious , and in manners pure ,</l>
     <l n="65">Pure as the priest , when robed in white he stands ,</l>
     <l n="66">The fresh lustration ready in his hands .</l>
     <l n="67">Thus Linus lived , and thus , as poets write ,</l>
     <l n="68">Tiresias , wiser for his loss of sight ;</l>
     <l n="69">Thus exiled Chalcas , thus the Bard of Thrace ,</l>
     <l n="70">Melodious tamer of the savage race ;</l>
     <l n="71">Thus train 'd by temperance , Homer led , of yore ,</l>
     <l n="72">His chief of Ithaca from shore to shore ,</l>
     <l n="73">Through magic Circe 's monster-peopled reign ,</l>
     <l n="74">And shoals insidious with the syren train ;</l>
     <l n="75">And through the realms where grizzly spectres dwell ,</l>
     <l n="76">Whose tribes he fetter 'd in a gory spell ;</l>
     <l n="77">For these are sacred bands , and from above</l>
     <l n="78">Drink large infusions from the mind of Jove .</l>
     <l n="79">Wouldst thou , ( perhaps ‘ tis hardly worth thine ear ,)</l>
     <l n="80">Wouldst thou be told my occupation here ?</l>
     <l n="81">The promised King of Peace employs my pen ,</l>
     <l n="82">The eternal covenant made for guilty men ,</l>
     <l n="83">The new-born Deity , with infant cries</l>
     <l n="84">Filling the sordid hovel where he lies ;</l>
     <l n="85">The hymning angels , and the herald star ,</l>
     <l n="86">That led the wise , who sought him from afar ,</l>
     <l n="87">And idols on their own unhallow 'd shore</l>
     <l n="88">Dash 'd , at his birth , to be revered no more .</l>
     <l n="89">This theme on reeds of Albion I rehearse :</l>
     <l n="90">The dawn of that blest day inspired the verse ;</l>
     <l n="91">Verse that , reserved in secret , shall attend</l>
     <l n="92">Thy candid voice , my critic and my friend !</l>

    <head>ELEGY VII .</head>
     <l n="1">As yet a stranger to the gentle fires</l>
     <l n="2">That Amathusia 's smiling queen inspires ,</l>
     <l n="3">Not seldom I derided Cupid 's darts ,</l>
     <l n="4">And scorn 'd his claim to rule all human hearts .</l>
     <l n="5">“ Go , child , ” I said , “ transfix the timorous dove !</l>
     <l n="6">An easy conquest suits an infant love ;</l>
     <l n="7">Enslave the sparrow , for such prize shall be</l>
     <l n="8">Sufficient triumph to a chief like thee !</l>
     <l n="9">Why aim thy idle arms at human kind ?</l>
     <l n="10">Thy shafts prevail not ‘ gainst the noble mind . ”</l>
     <l n="11">The Cyprian heard , and , kindling into ire ,</l>

     <l n="15">My eyes , too tender for the blaze of light ,</l>
     <l n="16">Still sought the shelter of retiring night ,</l>

     <l n="19">Nor less his infant features , and the sly ,</l>
     <l n="20">Sweet intimations of his threatening eye .</l>
     <l n="21">Such the Sigeian boy is seen above ,</l>
     <l n="22">Filling the goblet for imperial Jove ;</l>
     <l n="23">Such he , on whom the nymphs bestow 'd their charms ,</l>
     <l n="24">Hylas , who perish 'd in a naiad 's arms .</l>
     <l n="25">Angry he seem 'd , yet graceful in his ire ,</l>
     <l n="26">And added threats not destitute of fire .</l>
     <l n="27">“ My power , ” he said , “ by others ’ pain alone ,</l>

     <l n="30">And in thy anguish be my sway confest !</l>
     <l n="31">I vanquish 'd Phoebus , though returning vain</l>
     <l n="32">From his new triumph o'er the Python slain ,</l>
     <l n="33">And , when he thinks on Daphne , even he</l>

     <l n="35">A dart less true the Parthian horseman sped ,</l>

     <l n="38">The youth whose shaft his latent Procris slew .</l>
     <l n="39">Vanquish 'd by me see huge Orion bend ,</l>
     <l n="40">By me Alcides , and Alcides ’ friend .</l>

     <l n="44">Nor shall it reach thee with a trivial pain .</l>
     <l n="45">Thy muse , vain youth ! shall not thy peace ensure ,</l>
     <l n="46">Nor Phoebus ’ serpent yield thy wound a cure . ”</l>
     <l n="47">He spoke , and , waving a bright shaft in air ,</l>
     <l n="48">Sought the warm bosom of the Cyprian fair .</l>
     <l n="49">That thus a child should bluster in my ear .</l>
     <l n="50">Provoked my laughter more than moved my fear .</l>
     <l n="51">I shunn 'd not , therefore , public haunts , but stray 'd</l>
     <l n="52">Careless in city or suburban shade ,</l>
     <l n="53">And , passing and repassing nymphs , that moved</l>
     <l n="54">With grace divine , beheld where'er I roved .</l>
     <l n="55">Bright shone the vernal day with double blaze</l>
     <l n="56">As beauty gave new force to Phoebus ’ rays .</l>
     <l n="57">By no grave scruples check 'd , I freely eyed</l>
     <l n="58">The dangerous show , rash youth my only guide ,</l>
     <l n="59">And many a look of many a fair unknown</l>

     <l n="61">But one I mark 'd , ( then peace forsook my breast ,)</l>
     <l n="62">One — Oh how far superior to the rest !</l>
     <l n="63">What lovely features ! such the Cyprian queen</l>
     <l n="64">Herself might wish , and Juno wish her mien .</l>
     <l n="65">The very nymph was she , whom , when I dared</l>
     <l n="66">His arrows , Love had even then prepared !</l>
     <l n="67">Nor was himself remote , nor unsupplied</l>
     <l n="68">With torch well trimm 'd and quiver at his side ;</l>
     <l n="69">Now to her lips he clung , her eyelids now ,</l>
     <l n="70">Then settled on her cheeks , or on her brow ;</l>
     <l n="71">And with a thousand wounds from every part</l>
     <l n="72">Pierced and transpierced my undefended heart .</l>
     <l n="73">A fever , new to me , of fierce desire</l>
     <l n="74">Now seized my soul , and I was all on fire ;</l>
     <l n="75">But she , the while , whom only I adore ,</l>
     <l n="76">Was gone , and vanish 'd , to appear no more .</l>
     <l n="77">In silent sadness I pursue my way ;</l>
     <l n="78">I pause , I turn , proceed , yet wish to stay ,</l>
     <l n="79">And , while I follow her in thought , bemoan</l>
     <l n="80">With tears my soul 's delight so quickly flown .</l>
     <l n="81">When Jove had hurl 'd him to the Lemnian coast ,</l>
     <l n="82">So Vulcan sorrow 'd for Olympus lost ,</l>
     <l n="83">And so OEclides , sinking into night ,</l>
     <l n="84">From the deep gulf look 'd up to distant light .</l>
     <l n="85">Wretch that I am , what hopes for me remain ,</l>
     <l n="86">Who cannot cease to love , yet love in vain ?</l>
     <l n="87">Oh could I once , once more , behold the fair ,</l>
     <l n="88">Speak to her , tell her of the pangs I bear ;</l>
     <l n="89">Perhaps she is not adamant ; would show ,</l>
     <l n="90">Perhaps , some pity at my tale of woe .</l>
     <l n="91">Oh inauspicious flame — ‘ tis mine to prove</l>
     <l n="92">A matchless instance of disastrous love .</l>
     <l n="93">Ah , spare me , gentle power !— If such thou be ,</l>
     <l n="94">Let not thy deeds and nature disagree .</l>
     <l n="95">Spare me , and I will worship at no shrine</l>
     <l n="96">With vow and sacrifice save only thine .</l>
     <l n="97">Now I revere thy fires , thy bow , thy darts :</l>
     <l n="98">Now own thee sovereign of all human hearts .</l>
     <l n="99">Remove ! no — grant me still this raging woe !</l>
     <l n="100">Sweet is the wretchedness that lovers know :</l>
     <l n="101">But pierce hereafter ( should I chance to see</l>
     <l n="102">One destined mine ) at once both her and me .</l>
     <l n="103">Such were the trophies that , in earlier days ,</l>
     <l n="104">By vanity seduced , I toil 'd to raise ;</l>
     <l n="105">Studious , yet indolent , and urged by youth ,</l>
     <l n="106">That worst of teachers , from the ways of truth ;</l>
     <l n="107">Till Learning taught me in his shady bower</l>
     <l n="108">To quit love 's servile yoke , and spurn his power .</l>
     <l n="109">Then , on a sudden the fierce flame supprest ,</l>
     <l n="110">A frost continual settled on my breast ,</l>
     <l n="111">Whence Cupid fears his flame extinct to see ,</l>
     <l n="112">And Venus dreads a Diomede in me .</l>

    <head>TO HIS FATHER .</head>
     <l n="1">Oh that Pieria 's spring would through my breast</l>
     <l n="2">Pour its inspiring influence , and rush</l>
     <l n="3">No rill , but rather an o'erflowing flood ;</l>
     <l n="4">That , for my venerable father 's sake</l>
     <l n="5">All meaner themes renounced , my muse , on wings</l>
     <l n="6">Of duty borne , might reach a loftier strain !</l>
     <l n="7">For thee , my father ! howsoe'er it please ,</l>
     <l n="8">She frames this slender work ; nor know I aught</l>
     <l n="9">That may thy gifts more suitably requite :</l>
     <l n="10">Though to requite them suitably would ask</l>
     <l n="11">Returns much nobler , and surpassing far</l>
     <l n="12">The meagre stores of verbal gratitude :</l>
     <l n="13">But , such as I possess , I send thee all .</l>
     <l n="14">This page presents thee in their full amount</l>
     <l n="15">With thy son 's treasures , and the sum is nought ;</l>
     <l n="16">Nought , save the riches that from airy dream</l>
     <l n="17">In secret grottoes and in laurel bowers ,</l>
     <l n="18">I have , by golden Clio 's gift , acquired .</l>
     <l n="19">Verse is a work divine ; despise not thou</l>
     <l n="20">Verse therefore , which evinces ( nothing more )</l>
     <l n="21">Man 's heavenly source , and which , retaining still</l>
     <l n="22">Some scintillations of Promethean fire ,</l>
     <l n="23">Bespeaks him animated from above .</l>
     <l n="24">The gods love verse ; the infernal powers themselves</l>
     <l n="25">Confess the influence of verse , which stirs</l>
     <l n="26">The lowest deep , and binds in triple chains</l>
     <l n="27">Of adamant both Pluto and the shades .</l>
     <l n="28">In verse the Delphic priestess and the pale</l>
     <l n="29">Tremulous sybil make the future known ;</l>
     <l n="30">And he who sacrifices , on the shrine</l>
     <l n="31">Hangs verse , both when he smites the threatening bull</l>
     <l n="32">And when he spreads his reeking entrails wide</l>
     <l n="33">To scrutinize the fates enveloped there .</l>
     <l n="34">We too , ourselves , what time we seek again</l>
     <l n="35">Our native skies , and one eternal now</l>
     <l n="36">Shall be the only measure of our being ,</l>
     <l n="37">Crown 'd all with gold , and chanting to the lyre</l>
     <l n="38">Harmonious verse , shall range the courts above ,</l>
     <l n="39">And make the starry firmament resound .</l>
     <l n="40">And , even now , the fiery spirit pure</l>
     <l n="41">That wheels yon circling orbs , directs himself</l>
     <l n="42">Their mazy dance with melody of verse</l>
     <l n="43">Unutterable , immortal , hearing which</l>
     <l n="44">Huge Ophiuchus holds his hiss suppress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="45">Orion , soften 'd , drops his ardent blade ,</l>
     <l n="46">And Atlas stands unconscious of his load .</l>
     <l n="47">Verse graced of old the feasts of kings , ere yet</l>
     <l n="48">Luxurious dainties , destined to the gulf</l>
     <l n="49">Immense of gluttony , were known , and ere</l>
     <l n="50">Lyæus deluged yet the temperate board .</l>
     <l n="51">Then sat the bard a customary guest</l>
     <l n="52">To share the banquet , and , his length of locks</l>
     <l n="53">With beechen honours bound , proposed in verse</l>
     <l n="54">The characters of heroes and their deeds ,</l>
     <l n="55">To imitation ; sang of chaos old ,</l>
     <l n="56">Of nature 's birth , of gods that crept in search</l>
     <l n="57">Of acorns fallen , and of the thunderbolt</l>
     <l n="58">Not yet produced from Ætna 's fiery cave .</l>
     <l n="59">And what avails , at last , tune without voice ,</l>
     <l n="60">Devoid of matter ? Such may suit perhaps</l>
     <l n="61">The rural dance , but such was ne'er the song</l>
     <l n="62">Of Orpheus , whom the streams stood still to hear ,</l>
     <l n="63">And the oaks follow 'd . Not by chords alone</l>
     <l n="64">Well touch 'd , but by resistless accents more ,</l>
     <l n="65">To sympathetic tears the ghosts themselves</l>
     <l n="66">He moved ; these praises to his verse he owes .</l>
     <l n="67">Nor thou persist , I pray thee , still to slight</l>
     <l n="68">The sacred Nine , and to imagine vain</l>
     <l n="69">And useless powers , by whom inspired , thyself</l>
     <l n="70">Art skilful to associate verse with airs</l>
     <l n="71">Harmonious , and to give the human voice</l>
     <l n="72">A thousand modulations , heir by right</l>
     <l n="73">Indisputable of Arion 's fame .</l>
     <l n="74">Now say , what wonder is it , if a son</l>
     <l n="75">Of thine delight in verse , if , so conjoin 'd</l>
     <l n="76">In close affinity , we sympathize</l>
     <l n="77">In social arts and kindred studies sweet ?</l>
     <l n="78">Such distribution of himself to us</l>
     <l n="79">Was Phoebus ’ choice ; thou hast thy gift , and I</l>
     <l n="80">Mine also , and between us we receive ,</l>
     <l n="81">Father and son , the whole inspiring God .</l>
     <l n="82">No ! howsoe'er the semblance thou assume</l>
     <l n="83">Of hate , thou hatest not the gentle muse ,</l>
     <l n="84">My father ! for thou never badest me tread</l>
     <l n="85">The beaten path , and broad , that leads right on</l>
     <l n="86">To opulence , nor didst condemn thy son</l>
     <l n="87">To the insipid clamours of the bar ,</l>
     <l n="88">To laws voluminous , and ill observed ;</l>
     <l n="89">But , wishing to enrich me more , to fill</l>
     <l n="90">My mind with treasure , ledd'st me far away</l>
     <l n="91">From city din to deep retreats , to banks</l>
     <l n="92">And streams Aonian , and , with free consent ,</l>
     <l n="93">Didst place me happy at Apollo 's side .</l>
     <l n="94">I speak not now , on more important themes</l>
     <l n="95">Intent , of common benefits , and such</l>
     <l n="96">As nature bids , but of thy larger gifts ,</l>

     <l n="98">The stores of Roman rhetoric , and learn 'd</l>
     <l n="99">The full-ton 'd language of the eloquent Greeks ,</l>
     <l n="100">Whose lofty music graced the lips of Jove ,</l>
     <l n="101">Thyself didst counsel me to add the flowers</l>
     <l n="102">That Gallia boasts , those too , with which the smooth</l>
     <l n="103">Italian his degenerate speech adorns ,</l>
     <l n="104">That witnesses his mixture with the Goth ;</l>
     <l n="105">And Palestine 's prophetic songs divine .</l>
     <l n="106">To sum the whole , whate'er the heaven contains ,</l>
     <l n="107">The earth beneath it , and the air between ,</l>
     <l n="108">The rivers and the restless deep , may all</l>
     <l n="109">Prove intellectual gain to me , my wish</l>
     <l n="110">Concurring with thy will ; science herself ,</l>
     <l n="111">All cloud removed , inclines her beauteous head ,</l>
     <l n="112">And offers me the lip , if , dull of heart ,</l>
     <l n="113">I shrink not , and decline her gracious boon .</l>
     <l n="114">Go now , and gather dross , ye sordid minds</l>
     <l n="115">That covet it ; what could my father more ?</l>
     <l n="116">What more could Jove himself , unless he gave</l>
     <l n="117">His own abode , the heaven , in which he reigns ?</l>
     <l n="118">More eligible gifts than these were not</l>
     <l n="119">Apollo 's to his son , had they been safe</l>
     <l n="120">As they were insecure , who made the boy</l>
     <l n="121">The world 's vice-luminary , bade him rule</l>
     <l n="122">The radiant chariot of the day , and bind</l>
     <l n="123">To his young brows his own all-dazzling wreath .</l>
     <l n="124">I therefore , although last and least , my place</l>
     <l n="125">Among the learned in the laurel grove</l>
     <l n="126">Will hold , and where the conqueror 's ivy twines ,</l>
     <l n="127">Henceforth exempt from the unletter 'd throng</l>
     <l n="128">Profane , nor even to be seen by such .</l>
     <l n="129">Away then , sleepless care , complaint , away ,</l>
     <l n="130">And envy , with thy “ jealous leer malign ! ”</l>
     <l n="131">Nor let the monster calumny shoot forth</l>
     <l n="132">Her venom 'd tongue at me . Detested foes !</l>
     <l n="133">Ye all are impotent against my peace ,</l>
     <l n="134">For I am privileged , and bear my breast</l>
     <l n="135">Safe , and too high , for your viperean wound .</l>
     <l n="136">But thou ! my father , since to render thanks</l>
     <l n="137">Equivalent , and to requite by deeds</l>
     <l n="138">Thy liberality , exceeds my power ,</l>
     <l n="139">Suffice it , that I thus record thy gifts ,</l>
     <l n="140">And bear them treasured in a grateful mind !</l>
     <l n="141">Ye , too , the favourite pastime of my youth ,</l>
     <l n="142">My voluntary numbers , if ye dare</l>
     <l n="143">To hope longevity , and to survive</l>
     <l n="144">Your master 's funeral , not soon absorb 'd</l>
     <l n="145">In the oblivious Lethæan gulf ,</l>
     <l n="146">Shall to futurity perhaps convey</l>
     <l n="147">This theme , and by these praises of my sire</l>
     <l n="148">Improve the fathers of a distant age !</l>

    <head>TO GIOVANNI BATTISTA MANSO ,</head>
    <head>MARQUIS OF VILLA .</head>
    <head>MILTON 'S ACCOUNT OF MANSO .</head>
    <head>Giovanni Battista Manso , Marquis of Villa , is an Italian nobleman of the highest estimation among his countrymen , for genius , literature , and military accomplishments . To him Torquato Tasso addressed his Dialogues on Friendship , for he was much the friend of Tasso , who has also celebrated him among the other princes of his country , in his poem entitled , Gerusalemme Conquistata , book xx .</head>
     <l n="1">Fra cavalier magnanimi , e cortesi ,</l>
     <l n="2">Risplende il Manso .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>During the author 's stay at Naples he received at the hands of the Marquis a thousand kind offices and civilities , and , desirous not to appear ungrateful , sent him this poem a short time before his departure from that city .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">These verses also to thy praise , the Nine ,</l>
     <l n="2">O Manso ! happy in that theme , design ,</l>
     <l n="3">For , Gallus and Mæcenas gone , they see</l>
     <l n="4">None such besides , or whom they love as thee ;</l>
     <l n="5">And if my verse may give the meed of fame ,</l>
     <l n="6">Thine too shall prove an everlasting name .</l>
     <l n="7">Already such , it shines in Tasso 's page</l>
     <l n="8">( For thou wast Tasso 's friend ) from age to age ,</l>
     <l n="9">And , next , the muse consign 'd ( not unaware</l>
     <l n="10">How high the charge ) Marino to thy care ,</l>
     <l n="11">Who , singing to the nymphs Adonis ’ praise ,</l>
     <l n="12">Boasts thee the patron of his copious lays .</l>
     <l n="13">To thee alone the poet would entrust</l>
     <l n="14">His latest vows , to thee alone his dust ;</l>
     <l n="15">And thou with punctual piety hast paid ,</l>
     <l n="16">In labour 'd brass , thy tribute to his shade .</l>
     <l n="17">Nor this contented thee — but lest the grave</l>
     <l n="18">Should aught absorb of theirs which thou could'st save ,</l>
     <l n="19">All future ages thou hast deign 'd to teach</l>
     <l n="20">The life , lot , genius , character of each ,</l>
     <l n="21">Eloquent as the Carian sage , who , true</l>
     <l n="22">To his great theme , the life of Homer drew .</l>
     <l n="23">I , therefore , though a stranger youth , who come</l>
     <l n="24">Chill 'd by rude blasts that freeze my northern home ,</l>
     <l n="25">Thee dear to Clio , confident proclaim ,</l>
     <l n="26">And thine , for Phoebus ’ sake , a deathless name .</l>
     <l n="27">Nor thou , so kind , wilt view with scornful eye</l>
     <l n="28">A muse scarce rear 'd beneath our sullen sky ,</l>
     <l n="29">Who fears not , indiscreet as she is young ,</l>
     <l n="30">To seek in Latium hearers of her song .</l>
     <l n="31">We too , where Thames with its unsullied waves</l>
     <l n="32">The tresses of the blue-hair 'd Ocean laves ,</l>
     <l n="33">Hear oft by night , or , slumbering , seem to hear ,</l>
     <l n="34">O'er his wide stream , the swan 's voice warbling clear ;</l>
     <l n="35">And we could boast a Tityrus of yore</l>
     <l n="36">Who trod , a welcome guest , your happy shore .</l>
     <l n="37">Yes — dreary as we own our northern clime ,</l>
     <l n="38">E'en we to Phoebus raise the polish 'd rhyme ,</l>
     <l n="39">We too serve Phoebus ; Phoebus has received</l>
     <l n="40">( If legends old may claim to be believed )</l>
     <l n="41">No sordid gifts from us , the golden ear ,</l>
     <l n="42">The burnish 'd apple , ruddiest of the year ,</l>
     <l n="43">The fragrant crocus , and , to grace his fane ,</l>
     <l n="44">Fair damsels chosen from the Druid train ;</l>
     <l n="45">Druids , our native bards in ancient time ,</l>
     <l n="46">Who gods and heroes praised in hallow 'd rhyme !</l>
     <l n="47">Hence , often as the maids of Greece surround</l>
     <l n="48">Apollo 's shrine with hymns of festive sound ,</l>
     <l n="49">They named the virgins who arrived of yore</l>
     <l n="50">With British offerings on the Delian shore ,</l>
     <l n="51">Loxo , from giant Corineus sprung ,</l>
     <l n="52">Upis , on whose blest lips the future hung ,</l>
     <l n="53">And Hacaerge , with the golden hair ,</l>
     <l n="54">All deck 'd with Pictish hues , and all with bosoms bare .</l>
     <l n="55">Thou , therefore , happy sage , whatever clime</l>
     <l n="56">Shall ring with Tasso 's praise in after time ,</l>
     <l n="57">Or with Marino 's , shalt be known their friend ,</l>
     <l n="58">And with an equal flight to fame ascend .</l>
     <l n="59">The world shall hear how Phoebus and the Nine</l>
     <l n="60">Were inmates once , and willing guests of thine .</l>
     <l n="61">Yet Phoebus , when of old constrain 'd to roam</l>
     <l n="62">The earth , an exile from his heavenly home ,</l>
     <l n="63">Enter 'd , no willing guest , Admetus ’ door ,</l>
     <l n="64">Though Hercules had ventured there before .</l>
     <l n="65">But gentle Chiron 's cave was near , a scene</l>
     <l n="66">Of rural peace , clothed with perpetual green ,</l>
     <l n="67">And thither , oft as respite he required ,</l>
     <l n="68">From rustic clamours loud , the god retired .</l>
     <l n="69">There , many a time , on Peneus ’ bank reclined</l>
     <l n="70">At some oak 's root , with ivy thick entwined ,</l>
     <l n="71">Won by his hospitable friend 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="72">He soothed his pains of exile with the lyre .</l>
     <l n="73">Then shook the hills , then trembled Peneus ’ shore ,</l>
     <l n="74">Nor OEta felt his load of forest more ;</l>
     <l n="75">The upland elms descended to the plain ,</l>
     <l n="76">And soften 'd lynxes wonder 'd at that strain .</l>
     <l n="77">Well may we think , Oh , dear to all above !</l>
     <l n="78">Thy birth distinguish 'd by the smile of Jove ,</l>
     <l n="79">And that Apollo shed his kindliest power ,</l>
     <l n="80">And Maia 's son , on that propitious hour .</l>
     <l n="81">Since only minds so born can comprehend</l>
     <l n="82">A poet 's worth , or yield that worth a friend .</l>
     <l n="83">Hence on thy yet unfaded cheek appears</l>
     <l n="84">The lingering freshness of thy greener years ;</l>
     <l n="85">Hence in thy front and features we admire</l>
     <l n="86">Nature unwither 'd and a mind entire .</l>
     <l n="87">O might so true a friend to me belong ,</l>
     <l n="88">So skill 'd to grace the votaries of song ,</l>
     <l n="89">Should I recall hereafter into rhyme</l>
     <l n="90">The kings and heroes of my native clime ,</l>
     <l n="91">Arthur the chief , who even now prepares ,</l>
     <l n="92">In subterraneous being , future wars ,</l>
     <l n="93">With all his martial knights , to be restored</l>
     <l n="94">Each to his seat around the federal board ;</l>
     <l n="95">And oh , if spirit fail me not , disperse</l>
     <l n="96">Our Saxon plunderers in triumphant verse !</l>
     <l n="97">Then , after all , when , with the past content ,</l>
     <l n="98">A life I finish , not in silence spent ;</l>
     <l n="99">Should he , kind mourner , o'er my deathbed bend ,</l>
     <l n="100">I shall but need to say — “ Be yet my friend ! ”</l>
     <l n="101">He too , perhaps , shall bid the marble breathe</l>
     <l n="102">To honour me , and with the graceful wreath</l>
     <l n="103">Or of Parnassus or the Paphian isle</l>
     <l n="104">Shall bind my brows — but I shall rest the while .</l>
     <l n="105">Then also , if the fruits of faith endure ,</l>
     <l n="106">And virtue 's promised recompence be sure ,</l>
     <l n="107">Born to those seats to which the blest aspire</l>
     <l n="108">By purity of soul and virtuous fire ,</l>
     <l n="109">These rites , as fate permits , I shall survey</l>
     <l n="110">With eyes illumined by celestial day ,</l>
     <l n="111">And , every cloud from my pure spirit driven ,</l>
     <l n="112">Joy in the bright beatitude of heaven !</l>

    <head>ON THE DEATH OF DAMON .</head>
    <head>THE ARGUMENT .</head>
    <head>Thyrsis and Damon , shepherds and neighbours , had always pursued the same studies , and had , from their earliest days , been united in the closest friendship . Thyrsis , while travelling for improvement , received intelligence of the death of Damon , and , after a time , returning and finding it true , deplores himself , and his solitary condition , in this poem .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">By Damon is to be understood Charles Deodati , connected with the</l>
     <l n="2">Italian city of Lucca by his father 's side , in other respects an</l>
     <l n="3">Englishman ; a youth of uncommon genius , erudition , and virtue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="4">Ye Nymphs of Himera , ( for ye have shed</l>
     <l n="5">Erewhile for Daphnis , and for Hylas dead ,</l>
     <l n="6">And over Bion 's long-lamented bier ,</l>
     <l n="7">The fruitless meed of many a sacred tear ,)</l>
     <l n="8">Now through the villas laved by Thames rehearse</l>
     <l n="9">The woes of Thyrsis in Sicilian verse ,</l>
     <l n="10">What sighs he heaved , and how with groans profound</l>
     <l n="11">He made the woods and hollow rocks resound ,</l>
     <l n="12">Young Damon dead ; nor even ceased to pour</l>
     <l n="13">His lonely sorrows at the midnight hour .</l>
     <l n="14">The green wheat twice had nodded in the ear ,</l>
     <l n="15">And golden harvest twice enrich 'd the year ,</l>
     <l n="16">Since Damon 's lips had gasp 'd for vital air</l>
     <l n="17">The last , last time , nor Thyrsis yet was there ;</l>
     <l n="18">For he , enamour 'd of the muse , remain 'd</l>
     <l n="19">In Tuscan Fiorenza long detain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="20">But , stored at length with all he wish 'd to learn ,</l>
     <l n="21">For his flock 's sake , now hasted to return ;</l>
     <l n="22">And when the shepherd had resumed his seat</l>
     <l n="23">At the elm 's root , within his old retreat ,</l>
     <l n="24">Then ‘ twas his lot then all his loss to know ,</l>
     <l n="25">And from his burden 'd heart he vented thus his woe :</l>
     <l n="26">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="27">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="28">Alas ! what deities shall I suppose</l>
     <l n="29">In heaven , or earth , concerned for human woes ,</l>
     <l n="30">Since , oh my Damon ! their severe decree</l>
     <l n="31">So soon condemns me to regret of thee !</l>
     <l n="32">Depart'st thou thus , thy virtues unrepaid</l>
     <l n="33">With fame and honour , like a vulgar shade !</l>
     <l n="34">Let him forbid it , whose bright rod controls ,</l>
     <l n="35">And separates sordid from illustrious souls ,</l>
     <l n="36">Drive far the rabble , and to thee assign</l>
     <l n="37">A happier lot with spirits worthy thine !</l>
     <l n="38">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="39">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="40">Whate'er befall , unless by cruel chance</l>
     <l n="41">The wolf first give me a forbidding glance ,</l>
     <l n="42">Thou shalt not moulder undeplored , but long</l>
     <l n="43">Thy praise shall dwell on every shepherd 's tongue .</l>
     <l n="44">To Daphnis first they shall delight to pay ,</l>
     <l n="45">And , after him , to thee the votive lay ,</l>
     <l n="46">While Pales shall the flocks and pastures love ,</l>
     <l n="47">Or Faunus to frequent the field or grove ;</l>
     <l n="48">At least , if ancient piety and truth ,</l>
     <l n="49">With all the learned labours of thy youth ,</l>
     <l n="50">May serve thee aught , or to have left behind</l>
     <l n="51">A sorrowing friend , and of the tuneful kind .</l>
     <l n="52">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="53">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="54">Who now my pains and perils shall divide ,</l>
     <l n="55">As thou wast wont , for ever at my side ,</l>
     <l n="56">Both when the rugged frost annoy 'd our feet ,</l>
     <l n="57">And when the herbage all was parch 'd with heat ;</l>
     <l n="58">Whether the grim wolf 's ravage to prevent ,</l>
     <l n="59">Or the huge lion 's , arm 'd with darts we went ;</l>
     <l n="60">Whose converse now shall calm my stormy day ,</l>
     <l n="61">With charming song who now beguile my way ?</l>
     <l n="62">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="63">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="64">In whom shall I confide ? Whose counsel find</l>
     <l n="65">A balmy medicine for my troubled mind ?</l>
     <l n="66">Or whose discourse with innocent delight</l>
     <l n="67">Shall fill me now , and cheat the wintry night ,</l>
     <l n="68">While hisses on my hearth the pulpy pear ,</l>
     <l n="69">And blackening chestnuts start and crackle there ,</l>
     <l n="70">While storms abroad the dreary meadows whelm ,</l>
     <l n="71">And the wind thunders through the neighbouring elm ?</l>
     <l n="72">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="73">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="74">Or who , when summer suns their summit reach ,</l>
     <l n="75">And Pan sleeps hidden by the sheltering beech ,</l>
     <l n="76">When shepherds disappear , nymphs seek the sedge ,</l>
     <l n="77">And the stretch 'd rustic snores beneath the hedge ,</l>
     <l n="78">Who then shall render me thy pleasant vein</l>
     <l n="79">Of Attic wit , thy jests , thy smiles again ?</l>
     <l n="80">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="81">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="82">Where glens and vales are thickest overgrown</l>
     <l n="83">With tangled boughs , I wander now alone ,</l>
     <l n="84">Till night descend , while blustering wind and shower</l>
     <l n="85">Beat on my temples through the shatter 'd bower .</l>
     <l n="86">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="87">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="88">Alas ! what rampant weeds now shame my fields ,</l>
     <l n="89">And what a mildew 'd crop the furrow yields ;</l>
     <l n="90">My rambling vines unwedded to the trees ,</l>
     <l n="91">Bear shrivell 'd grapes ; my myrtles fail to please ;</l>
     <l n="92">Nor please me more my flocks : they , slighted turn</l>
     <l n="93">Their unavailing looks on me , and mourn .</l>
     <l n="94">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="95">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="96">Ægon invites me to the hazel grove ,</l>
     <l n="97">Amyntas , on the river 's bank to rove ,</l>
     <l n="98">And young Alphesiboeus to a seat</l>
     <l n="99">Where branching elms exclude the mid-day heat .</l>
     <l n="100">‘ Here fountains spring — here mossy hillocks rise ;</l>
     <l n="101">Here zephyr whispers , and the stream replies . ’ —</l>
     <l n="102">Thus each persuades , but , deaf to every call ,</l>
     <l n="103">I gain the thickets , and escape them all .</l>
     <l n="104">“ Go , seek your home , my lambs ; my thoughts are due</l>
     <l n="105">To other cares than those of feeding you .</l>
     <l n="106">Then Mopsus said , ( the same who reads so well</l>
     <l n="107">The voice of birds , and what the stars foretell ,</l>
     <l n="108">For he by chance had noticed my return ,)</l>
     <l n="109">‘ What means thy sullen mood , this deep concern ?</l>
     <l n="110">Ah , Thyrsis , thou art either crazed with love ,</l>
     <l n="111">Or some sinister influence from above ;</l>
     <l n="112">Dull Saturn 's influence oft the shepherds rue ;</l>
     <l n="113">His leaden shaft oblique has pierced thee through . ’</l>
     <l n="114">“ Go , go , my lambs , unpastured as ye are ,</l>
     <l n="115">My thoughts are all now due to other care .</l>
     <l n="116">The nymphs amazed , my melancholy see ,</l>
     <l n="117">And , ‘ Thyrsis ! ’ cry — ‘ what will become of thee ?</l>
     <l n="118">What wouldst thou , Thyrsis ? such should not appear</l>
     <l n="119">The brow of youth , stern , gloomy , and severe ;</l>
     <l n="120">Brisk youth should laugh and love — ah , shun the fate</l>
     <l n="121">Of those , twice wretched mopes ! who love too late ! ’</l>
     <l n="122">“ Go , go , my lambs , unpastured as ye are ;</l>
     <l n="123">My thoughts are all now due to other care .</l>
     <l n="124">Ægle with Hyas came , to soothe my pain ,</l>
     <l n="125">And Baucis ’ daughter , Dryope , the vain ,</l>
     <l n="126">Fair Dryope , for voice and finger neat</l>
     <l n="127">Known far and near , and for her self-conceit ;</l>
     <l n="128">Chloris too came , whose cottage on the lands</l>
     <l n="129">That skirt the Idumanian current stands ;</l>
     <l n="130">But all in vain they came , and but to see</l>
     <l n="131">Kind words , and comfortable , lost on me .</l>
     <l n="132">“ Go , go , my lambs , unpastured as ye are ;</l>
     <l n="133">My thoughts are all now due to other care .</l>
     <l n="134">Ah blest indifference of the playful herd ,</l>
     <l n="135">None by his fellow chosen , or preferr 'd !</l>
     <l n="136">No bonds of amity the flocks inthral ,</l>
     <l n="137">But each associates , and is pleased with all ;</l>
     <l n="138">So graze the dappled deer in numerous droves ,</l>
     <l n="139">And all his kind alike the zebra loves ;</l>
     <l n="140">That same law governs , where the billows roar ,</l>
     <l n="141">And Proteus ’ shoals o'erspread the desert shore ;</l>
     <l n="142">The sparrow , meanest of the feather 'd race ,</l>
     <l n="143">His fit companion finds in every place ,</l>
     <l n="144">With whom he picks the grain that suits him best ,</l>
     <l n="145">Flirts here and there , and late returns to rest ,</l>
     <l n="146">And whom , if chance the falcon makes his prey ,</l>
     <l n="147">Or hedger with his well aim 'd arrow slay ,</l>
     <l n="148">For no such loss the gay survivor grieves ,</l>
     <l n="149">New love he seeks , and new delight receives .</l>
     <l n="150">We only , an obdurate kind , rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="151">Scorning all others , in a single choice .</l>
     <l n="152">We scarce in thousands meet one kindred mind ,</l>
     <l n="153">And if the long-sought good at last we find ,</l>
     <l n="154">When least we fear it , Death our treasure steals ,</l>
     <l n="155">And gives our heart a wound that nothing heals .</l>
     <l n="156">“ Go , go , my lambs , unpastured as ye are ;</l>
     <l n="157">My thoughts are all now due to other care .</l>
     <l n="158">Ah , what delusion lured me from my flocks ,</l>
     <l n="159">To traverse Alpine snows and rugged rocks !</l>
     <l n="160">What need so great had I to visit Rome ,</l>
     <l n="161">Now sunk in ruins , and herself a tomb ?</l>
     <l n="162">Or , had she flourish 'd still , as when , of old ,</l>
     <l n="163">For her sake Tityrus forsook his fold ,</l>
     <l n="164">What need so great had I to incur a pause</l>
     <l n="165">Of thy sweet intercourse for such a cause ,</l>
     <l n="166">For such a cause to place the roaring sea ,</l>
     <l n="167">Rocks , mountains , woods , between my friend and me ?</l>
     <l n="168">Else , had I grasp 'd thy feeble hand , composed</l>
     <l n="169">Thy decent limbs , thy drooping eyelids closed ,</l>
     <l n="170">And , at the last , had said — ‘ Farewell — ascend —</l>
     <l n="171">Nor even in the skies forget thy friend ! ’</l>
     <l n="172">“ Go , go , my lambs , untended homeward fare ;</l>
     <l n="173">My thoughts are all now due to other care .</l>
     <l n="174">Although well pleased , ye tuneful Tuscan swains !</l>
     <l n="175">My mind the memory of your worth retains ,</l>
     <l n="176">Yet not your worth can teach me less to mourn</l>
     <l n="177">My Damon lost .— He too was Tuscan born ,</l>
     <l n="178">Born in your Lucca , city of renown !</l>
     <l n="179">And wit possess 'd , and genius , like your own .</l>
     <l n="180">Oh how elate was I , when , stretch 'd beside</l>
     <l n="181">The murmuring course of Arno 's breezy tide ,</l>
     <l n="182">Beneath the poplar grove I pass 'd my hours ,</l>
     <l n="183">Now cropping myrtles , and now vernal flowers ,</l>
     <l n="184">And hearing , as I lay at ease along ,</l>
     <l n="185">Your swains contending for the prize of song !</l>
     <l n="186">I also dared attempt ( and , as it seems ,</l>
     <l n="187">Not much displeased attempting ) various themes ,</l>
     <l n="188">For even I can presents boast from you ,</l>
     <l n="189">The shepherd 's pipe , and ozier basket too ,</l>
     <l n="190">And Dati and Francini both have made</l>
     <l n="191">My name familiar to the beechen shade ,</l>
     <l n="192">And they are learn 'd , and each in every place</l>
     <l n="193">Renown 'd for song , and both of Lydian race .</l>
     <l n="194">“ Go , go , my lambs , untended homeward fare ;</l>
     <l n="195">My thoughts are all now due to other care .</l>
     <l n="196">While bright the dewy grass with moonbeams shone ,</l>
     <l n="197">And I stood hurdling in my kids alone ,</l>
     <l n="198">How often have I said ( but thou hadst found</l>
     <l n="199">Ere then thy dark cold lodgment underground )</l>
     <l n="200">Now Damon sings , or springes sets for hares ,</l>
     <l n="201">Or wickerwork for various use prepares !</l>
     <l n="202">How oft , indulging fancy , have I plann 'd</l>
     <l n="203">New scenes of pleasure that I hoped at hand ,</l>
     <l n="204">Call 'd thee abroad as I was wont , and cried —</l>
     <l n="205">‘ What , hoa ! my friend — come lay thy task aside ;</l>
     <l n="206">Haste , let us forth together , and beguile</l>
     <l n="207">The heat beneath yon whispering shades awhile ,</l>
     <l n="208">Or on the margin stray of Colne 's clear flood ,</l>
     <l n="209">Or where Cassibelan 's grey turrets stood !</l>
     <l n="210">There thou shalt cull me simples , and shalt teach</l>
     <l n="211">Thy friend the name and healing powers of each ,</l>
     <l n="212">From the tall bluebell to the dwarfish weed ,</l>
     <l n="213">What the dry land , and what the marshes breed ,</l>
     <l n="214">For all their kinds alike to thee are known ,</l>

     <l n="217">The useless herbs that gave not health to thee !</l>
     <l n="218">Twelve evenings since , as in poetic dream ,</l>
     <l n="219">I meditating sat some statelier theme ,</l>
     <l n="220">The reeds no sooner touch 'd my lip , though new ,</l>
     <l n="221">And unessay 'd before , than wide they flew ,</l>
     <l n="222">Bursting their waxen bands , nor could sustain</l>
     <l n="223">The deep-toned music of the solemn strain ;</l>
     <l n="224">And I am vain perhaps , but I will tell</l>
     <l n="225">How proud a theme I chose — ye groves , farewell .</l>

     <l n="238">Pregnant with Arthur of heroic fame .</l>
     <l n="239">These themes I now revolve — and Oh — if Fate</l>

     <l n="241">Adieu my shepherd 's reed — yon pine tree bough</l>

     <l n="247">And it shall well suffice me , and shall be</l>
     <l n="248">Fame and proud recompence enough for me ,</l>

     <l n="296">In those ethereal mansions thou art known .</l>
     <l n="297">Thy blush was maiden , and thy youth the taste</l>

     <l n="299">The honours , therefore , by divine decree</l>
     <l n="300">The lot of virgin worth , are given to thee :</l>
     <l n="301">Thy brows encircled with a radiant band ,</l>
     <l n="302">And the green palm branch waving in thy hand ,</l>
     <l n="303">Thou in immortal nuptials shalt rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="304">And join with seraphs thy according voice ,</l>
     <l n="305">Where rapture reigns , and the ecstatic lyre</l>

   <p>AN ODE , ADDRESSED TO MR. JOHN ROUSE ,</p>
   <p>LIBRARIAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD ,</p>
   <p>On a lost Volume of my Poems , which he desired me to replace , that he might add them to my other Works deposited in the Library .</p>
   <p>This ode is rendered without rhyme , that it might more adequately represent the original , which , as Milton himself informs us , is of no certain measure . It may possibly for this reason disappoint the reader , though it cost the writer more labour than the translation of any other piece in the whole collection .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The winter night now well nigh worn away ,</l>
     <l n="2">The wakeful cock proclaim 'd approaching day ,</l>
     <l n="3">When Simulus , poor tenant of a farm</l>
     <l n="4">Of narrowest limits , heard the shrill alarm ,</l>
     <l n="5">Yawn 'd , stretch 'd his limbs , and anxious to provide</l>
     <l n="6">Against the pangs of hunger unsupplied ,</l>
     <l n="7">By slow degrees his tatter 'd bed forsook ,</l>
     <l n="8">And , poking in the dark , explored the nook</l>
     <l n="9">Where embers slept with ashes heap 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="10">And with burnt fingers ’ ends the treasure found .</l>
     <l n="11">It chanced that from a brand beneath his nose ,</l>
     <l n="12">Sure proof of latent fire some smoke arose ;</l>
     <l n="13">When , trimming with a pin the incrusted tow ,</l>
     <l n="14">And stooping it towards the coals below ,</l>
     <l n="15">He toils , with cheeks distended , to excite</l>
     <l n="16">The lingering flame , and gains at length a light .</l>
     <l n="17">With prudent heed he spreads his hand before</l>
     <l n="18">The quivering lamp , and opes his granary door .</l>
     <l n="19">Small was his stock , but taking for the day</l>
     <l n="20">A measured stint of twice eight pounds away ,</l>
     <l n="21">With these his mill he seeks . A shelf at hand ,</l>
     <l n="22">Fix 'd in the wall , affords his lamp a stand :</l>
     <l n="23">Then baring both his arms — a sleeveless coat</l>
     <l n="24">He girds , the rough exuviæ of a goat :</l>
     <l n="25">And with a rubber , for that use design 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">Cleansing his mill within — begins to grind ;</l>
     <l n="27">Each hand has its employ ; labouring amain ,</l>
     <l n="28">This turns the winch , while that supplies the grain .</l>
     <l n="29">The stone , revolving rapidly , now glows ,</l>
     <l n="30">And the bruised corn a mealy current flows ;</l>
     <l n="31">While he , to make his heavy labour light ,</l>
     <l n="32">Tasks oft his left hand to relieve his right ;</l>
     <l n="33">And chants with rudest accent , to beguile</l>
     <l n="34">His ceaseless toil , as rude a strain the while .</l>
     <l n="35">And now , “ Dame Cybale , come forth ! ” he cries ;</l>
     <l n="36">But Cybale , still slumbering , nought replies .</l>
     <l n="37">From Afric she , the swain 's sole serving-maid ,</l>
     <l n="38">Whose face and form alike her birth betray 'd .</l>
     <l n="39">With woolly locks , lips tumid , sable skin ,</l>
     <l n="40">Wide bosom , udders flaccid , belly thin ,</l>
     <l n="41">Legs slender , broad and most misshapen feet ,</l>
     <l n="42">Chapp 'd into chinks , and parch 'd with solar heat .</l>
     <l n="43">Such , summon 'd oft , she came ; at his command</l>
     <l n="44">Fresh fuel heap 'd , the sleeping embers fann 'd ,</l>
     <l n="45">And made in haste her simmering skillet steam ,</l>
     <l n="46">Replenish 'd newly from the neighbouring stream .</l>
     <l n="47">The labours of the mill perform 'd , a sieve</l>
     <l n="48">The mingled flour and bran must next receive ,</l>
     <l n="49">Which shaken oft shoots Ceres through refined ,</l>
     <l n="50">And better dress 'd , her husks all left behind .</l>
     <l n="51">This done , at once his future plain repast</l>
     <l n="52">Unleaven 'd on a shaven board he cast ,</l>
     <l n="53">With tepid lymph first largely soak 'd it all ,</l>
     <l n="54">Then gather 'd it with both hands to a ball ,</l>
     <l n="55">And spreading it again with both hands wide ,</l>
     <l n="56">With sprinkled salt the stiffen 'd mass supplied ;</l>
     <l n="57">At length the stubborn substance , duly wrought ,</l>
     <l n="58">Takes from his palms impress 'd the shape it ought ,</l>
     <l n="59">Becomes an orb — and quarter 'd into shares ,</l>
     <l n="60">The faithful mark of just division bears ,</l>
     <l n="61">Last , on his hearth it finds convenient space ,</l>
     <l n="62">For Cybale before had swept the place ,</l>
     <l n="63">And there , with tiles and embers overspread ,</l>
     <l n="64">She leaves it — reeking in its sultry bed .</l>
     <l n="65">Nor Simulus , while Vulcan thus alone</l>
     <l n="66">His part perform 'd , proves heedless of his own ,</l>
     <l n="67">But sedulous , not merely to subdue</l>
     <l n="68">His hunger , but to please his palate too ,</l>
     <l n="69">Prepares more savoury food . His chimney side</l>
     <l n="70">Could boast no gammon , salted well and dried</l>
     <l n="71">And hook 'd behind him ; but sufficient store</l>
     <l n="72">Of bundled anise and a cheese it bore ;</l>
     <l n="73">A broad round cheese , which , through its centre strung</l>
     <l n="74">With a tough broom twig , in the corner hung ;</l>
     <l n="75">The prudent hero , therefore , with address</l>
     <l n="76">And quick despatch , now seeks another mess .</l>
     <l n="77">Close to his cottage lay a garden ground .</l>
     <l n="78">With reeds and osiers sparely girt around :</l>
     <l n="79">Small was the spot , but liberal to produce ;</l>
     <l n="80">Nor wanted aught to serve a peasant 's use ,</l>
     <l n="81">And sometimes e'en the rich would borrow thence ,</l>
     <l n="82">Although its tillage was its sole expense .</l>
     <l n="83">For oft as from his toils abroad he ceased ,</l>
     <l n="84">Home-bound by weather , or some stated feast ,</l>
     <l n="85">His debt of culture here he duly paid ,</l>
     <l n="86">And only left the plough to wield the spade .</l>
     <l n="87">He knew to give each plant the soil it needs ,</l>
     <l n="88">To drill the ground and cover close the seeds ;</l>
     <l n="89">And could with ease compel the wanton rill</l>
     <l n="90">To turn and wind obedient to his will .</l>
     <l n="91">There flourish 'd star-wort , and the branching beet ,</l>
     <l n="92">The sorrel acid , and the mallow sweet ,</l>
     <l n="93">The skirret , and the leek 's aspiring kind ,</l>
     <l n="94">The noxious poppy — quencher of the mind !</l>
     <l n="95">Salubrious sequel of a sumptuous board ,</l>
     <l n="96">The lettuce , and the long huge-bellied gourd ;</l>
     <l n="97">But these ( for none his appetite controll 'd</l>
     <l n="98">With stricter sway ) the thrifty rustic sold ;</l>
     <l n="99">With broom twigs neatly bound , each kind apart ,</l>
     <l n="100">He bore them ever to the public mart :</l>
     <l n="101">Whence laden still , but with a lighter load ,</l>
     <l n="102">Of cash well earn 'd he took his homeward road ,</l>
     <l n="103">Expending seldom , ere he quitted Rome ,</l>
     <l n="104">His gains in flesh-meat for a feast at home .</l>
     <l n="105">There , at no cost , on onions , rank and red ,</l>
     <l n="106">Or the curl 'd endive 's bitter leaf , he fed :</l>
     <l n="107">On scallions sliced , or , with a sensual gust ,</l>
     <l n="108">On rockets — foul provocatives of lust !</l>
     <l n="109">Nor even shunn 'd with smarting gums to press</l>
     <l n="110">Nasturtium — pungent face-distorting mess !</l>
     <l n="111">Some such regale now also in his thought ,</l>
     <l n="112">With hasty steps his garden ground he sought ;</l>
     <l n="113">There , delving with his hands , he first displaced</l>
     <l n="114">Four plants of garlick , large , and rooted fast ;</l>
     <l n="115">The tender tops of parsley next he culls ,</l>
     <l n="116">Then the old rue bush shudders as he pulls ;</l>
     <l n="117">And coriander last to these succeeds ,</l>
     <l n="118">That hangs on slightest threads her trembling seeds .</l>
     <l n="119">Placed near his sprightly fire , he now demands</l>
     <l n="120">The mortar at his sable servant 's hands ;</l>
     <l n="121">When , stripping all his garlick first , he tore</l>
     <l n="122">The exterior coats , and cast them on the floor ,</l>
     <l n="123">Then cast away with like contempt the skin ,</l>
     <l n="124">Flimsier concealment of the cloves within .</l>
     <l n="125">These , search 'd , and perfect found , he one by one</l>
     <l n="126">Rinsed , and disposed within the hollow stone .</l>
     <l n="127">Salt added , and a lump of salted cheese ,</l>
     <l n="128">With his injected herbs he cover 'd these ,</l>
     <l n="129">And , tucking with his left his tunic tight ,</l>
     <l n="130">And seizing fast the pestle with his right ,</l>
     <l n="131">The garlick bruising first he soon express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="132">And mix 'd the various juices of the rest .</l>
     <l n="133">He grinds , and by degrees his herbs below ,</l>
     <l n="134">Lost in each other , their own powers forego ,</l>
     <l n="135">And with the cheese in compound , to the sight</l>
     <l n="136">Nor wholly green appear nor wholly white .</l>
     <l n="137">His nostrils oft the forceful fume resent ,</l>
     <l n="138">He cursed full oft his dinner for its scent ;</l>
     <l n="139">Or , with wry faces , wiping as he spoke</l>
     <l n="140">The trickling tears , cried , “ Vengeance on the smoke ! ”</l>
     <l n="141">The work proceeds : not roughly turns he now</l>
     <l n="142">The pestle , but in circles smooth and slow ;</l>
     <l n="143">With cautious hand , that grudges what it spills ,</l>
     <l n="144">Some drops of olive oil he next instils ,</l>
     <l n="145">Then vinegar with caution scarcely less ,</l>
     <l n="146">And gathering to a ball the medley mess ,</l>
     <l n="147">Last , with two fingers frugally applied ,</l>
     <l n="148">Sweeps the small remnant from the mortar 's side .</l>
     <l n="149">And , thus complete in figure and in kind ,</l>
     <l n="150">Obtains at length the salad he design 'd .</l>
     <l n="151">And now black Cybale before him stands ,</l>
     <l n="152">The cake drawn newly glowing in her hands ,</l>
     <l n="153">He glad receives it , chasing far away</l>
     <l n="154">All fears of famine for the passing day ;</l>
     <l n="155">His legs enclosed in buskins , and his head</l>
     <l n="156">In its tough casque of leather , forth he led</l>
     <l n="157">And yoked his steers , a dull obedient pair ,</l>
     <l n="158">Then drove afield , and plunged the pointed share .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">This Italy was moved — nor did the chief</l>
     <l n="2">Æneas in his mind less tumult feel .</l>
     <l n="3">On every side his anxious thought he turns ,</l>
     <l n="4">Restless , unfix 'd , not knowing what to choose .</l>
     <l n="5">And as a cistern that in brim of brass</l>
     <l n="6">Confines the crystal flood , if chance the sun</l>
     <l n="7">Smite on it , or the moon 's resplendent orb ,</l>
     <l n="8">The quivering light now flashes on the walls ,</l>
     <l n="9">Now leaps uncertain to the vaulted roof :</l>
     <l n="10">Such were the wavering motions of his mind .</l>
     <l n="11">‘ Twas night — and weary nature sunk to rest .</l>
     <l n="12">The birds , the bleating flocks , were heard no more .</l>
     <l n="13">At length , on the cold ground , beneath the damp</l>
     <l n="14">And dewy vault , fast by the river 's brink ,</l>
     <l n="15">The father of his country sought repose .</l>
     <l n="16">When lo ! among the spreading poplar boughs ,</l>
     <l n="17">Forth from his pleasant stream , propitious rose</l>
     <l n="18">The god of Tiber : clear transparent gauze</l>
     <l n="19">Infolds his loins , his brows with reeds are crown 'd :</l>
     <l n="20">And these his gracious words to soothe his care :</l>
     <l n="21">“ Heaven-born , who bring'st our kindred home again ,</l>
     <l n="22">Rescued , and givest eternity to Troy ,</l>
     <l n="23">Long have Laurentum and the Latian plains</l>
     <l n="24">Expected thee ; behold thy fix 'd abode .</l>
     <l n="25">Fear not the threats of war , the storm is past ,</l>
     <l n="26">The gods appeased . For proof that what thou hear'st</l>
     <l n="27">Is no vain forgery or delusive dream ,</l>
     <l n="28">Beneath the grove that borders my green bank ,</l>
     <l n="29">A milk-white swine , with thirty milk-white young ,</l>
     <l n="30">Shall greet thy wondering eyes . Mark well the place ;</l>
     <l n="31">For ‘ tis thy place of rest , there end thy toils :</l>
     <l n="32">There , twice ten years elapsed , fair Alba 's walls</l>
     <l n="33">Shall rise , fair Alba , by Ascanius ’ hand .</l>
     <l n="34">Thus shall it be — now listen , while I teach</l>
     <l n="35">The means to accomplish these events at hand .</l>
     <l n="36">The Arcadians here , a race from Pallas sprung ,</l>
     <l n="37">Following Evander 's standard and his fate ,</l>
     <l n="38">High on these mountains , a well chosen spot ,</l>
     <l n="39">Have built a city , for their grandsire 's sake</l>
     <l n="40">Named Pallanteum . These perpetual war</l>
     <l n="41">Wage with the Latians : join 'd in faithful league</l>
     <l n="42">And arms confederate , add them to your camp .</l>
     <l n="43">Myself between my winding banks will speed</l>
     <l n="44">Your well oar 'd barks to stem the opposing tide .</l>
     <l n="45">Rise , goddess born , arise ; and with the first</l>
     <l n="46">Declining stars seek Juno in thy prayer ,</l>
     <l n="47">And vanquish all her wrath with suppliant vows .</l>
     <l n="48">When conquest crowns thee , then remember me .</l>
     <l n="49">I am the Tiber , whose cærulean stream</l>
     <l n="50">Heaven favours ; I with copious flood divide</l>
     <l n="51">These grassy banks , and cleave the fruitful meads .</l>
     <l n="52">My mansion , this — and lofty cities crown</l>
     <l n="53">My fountain head . ” — He spoke and sought the deep ,</l>
     <l n="54">And plunged his form beneath the closing flood .</l>
     <l n="55">Æneas at the morning dawn awoke ,</l>
     <l n="56">And , rising , with uplifted eye beheld</l>
     <l n="57">The orient sun , then dipp 'd his palms , and scoop 'd</l>
     <l n="58">The brimming stream , and thus address 'd the skies :</l>
     <l n="59">“ Ye nymphs , Laurentian nymphs , who feed the source</l>
     <l n="60">Of many a stream , and thou , with thy blest flood ,</l>
     <l n="61">O Tiber , hear , accept me , and afford ,</l>
     <l n="62">At length afford , a shelter from my woes .</l>
     <l n="63">Where'er in secret cavern under ground</l>
     <l n="64">Thy waters sleep , where'er they spring to light ,</l>
     <l n="65">Since thou hast pity for a wretch like me ,</l>
     <l n="66">My offerings and my vows shall wait thee still :</l>
     <l n="67">Great horned Father of Hesperian floods ,</l>
     <l n="68">Be gracious now , and ratify thy word . ”</l>
     <l n="69">He said , and chose two galleys from his fleet ,</l>
     <l n="70">Fits them with oars , and clothes the crew in arms .</l>
     <l n="71">When lo ! astonishing and pleasing sight ,</l>
     <l n="72">The milk-white dam , with her unspotted brood ,</l>
     <l n="73">Lay stretch 'd upon the bank , beneath the grove .</l>
     <l n="74">To thee , the pious Prince , Juno , to thee</l>
     <l n="75">Devotes them all , all on thine altar bleed .</l>
     <l n="76">That live-long night old Tiber smooth 'd his flood ,</l>
     <l n="77">And so restrain 'd it that it seem 'd to stand</l>
     <l n="78">Motionless as a pool , or silent lake ,</l>
     <l n="79">That not a billow might resist their oars .</l>
     <l n="80">With cheerful sound of exhortation soon</l>
     <l n="81">Their voyage they begin ; the pitchy keel</l>
     <l n="82">Slides through the gentle deep , the quiet stream</l>
     <l n="83">Admires the unwonted burden that it bears ,</l>
     <l n="84">Well polish 'd arms , and vessels painted gay .</l>
     <l n="85">Beneath the shade of various trees , between</l>
     <l n="86">The umbrageous branches of the spreading groves ,</l>
     <l n="87">They cut their liquid way , nor day nor night</l>
     <l n="88">They slack their course , unwinding as they go</l>
     <l n="89">The long meanders of the peaceful tide .</l>
     <l n="90">The glowing sun was in meridian height ,</l>
     <l n="91">When from afar they saw the humble walls ,</l>
     <l n="92">And the few scatter 'd cottages , which now</l>
     <l n="93">The Roman power has equall 'd with the clouds ;</l>
     <l n="94">But such was then Evander 's scant domain .</l>
     <l n="95">They steer to shore , and hasten to the town .</l>
     <l n="96">It chanced the Arcadian monarch on that day ,</l>
     <l n="97">Before the walls , beneath a shady grove ,</l>
     <l n="98">Was celebrating high , in solemn feast ,</l>
     <l n="99">Alcides and his tutelary gods .</l>
     <l n="100">Pallas , his son , was there , and there the chief</l>
     <l n="101">Of all his youth ; with these , a worthy tribe ,</l>
     <l n="102">His poor but venerable senate , burnt</l>
     <l n="103">Sweet incense , and their altars smoked with blood .</l>
     <l n="104">Soon as they saw the towering masts approach ,</l>
     <l n="105">Sliding between the trees , while the crew rest</l>
     <l n="106">Upon their silent oars , amazed they rose ,</l>
     <l n="107">Not without fear , and all forsook the feast .</l>
     <l n="108">But Pallas undismay 'd , his javelin seized ,</l>
     <l n="109">Rush 'd to the bank , and from a rising ground</l>
     <l n="110">Forbade them to disturb the sacred rites .</l>
     <l n="111">“ Ye stranger youth ! What prompts you to explore</l>
     <l n="112">This untried way ? and whither do ye steer ?</l>
     <l n="113">Whence , and who are ye ? Bring ye peace or war ? ”</l>
     <l n="114">Æneas from his lofty deck holds forth</l>
     <l n="115">The peaceful olive branch , and thus replies :</l>
     <l n="116">“ Trojans and enemies to the Latian state ,</l>
     <l n="117">Whom they with unprovoked hostilities</l>
     <l n="118">Have driven away , thou seest . We seek Evander —</l>
     <l n="119">Say this — and say beside , the Trojan chiefs</l>
     <l n="120">Are come , and seek his friendship and his aid . ”</l>
     <l n="121">Pallas with wonder heard that awful name ,</l>
     <l n="122">And “ Whosoe'er thou art , ” he cried , “ come forth :</l>
     <l n="123">Bear thine own tidings to my father 's ear ,</l>
     <l n="124">And be a welcome guest beneath our roof . ”</l>
     <l n="125">He said , and press 'd the stranger to his breast :</l>
     <l n="126">Then led him from the river to the grove ,</l>
     <l n="127">Where , courteous , thus Æneas greets the king :</l>
     <l n="128">“ Best of the Grecian race , to whom I bow</l>
     <l n="129">( So wills my fortune ) suppliant , and stretch forth</l>
     <l n="130">In sign of amity this peaceful branch ,</l>
     <l n="131">I fear 'd thee not , although I knew thee well</l>
     <l n="132">A Grecian leader , born in Arcady ,</l>
     <l n="133">And kinsman of the Atridæ . Me my virtue ,</l>
     <l n="134">That means no wrong to thee — the Oracles ,</l>
     <l n="135">Our kindred families allied of old ,</l>
     <l n="136">And thy renown diffused through every land ,</l>
     <l n="137">Have all conspired to bind in friendship to thee ,</l>
     <l n="138">And send me not unwilling to thy shores .</l>
     <l n="139">Dardanus , author of the Trojan state ,</l>
     <l n="140">( So say the Greeks ,) was fair Electra 's son ;</l>
     <l n="141">Electra boasted Atlas for her sire ,</l>
     <l n="142">Whose shoulders high sustain the ethereal orbs .</l>
     <l n="143">Your sire is Mercury , whom Maia bore ,</l>
     <l n="144">Sweet Maia , on Cyllene 's hoary top .</l>
     <l n="145">Her , if we credit aught tradition old ,</l>
     <l n="146">Atlas of yore , the self-same Atlas , claim 'd</l>
     <l n="147">His daughter . Thus united close in blood ,</l>
     <l n="148">Thy race and ours one common sire confess .</l>
     <l n="149">With these credentials fraught , I would not send</l>
     <l n="150">Ambassadors with artful phrase to sound</l>
     <l n="151">And win thee by degrees — but came myself —</l>
     <l n="152">Me , therefore , me thou seest ; my life the stake :</l>
     <l n="153">‘ Tis I , Æneas , who implore thine aid .</l>
     <l n="154">Should Daunia , that now aims the blow at thee ,</l>
     <l n="155">Prevail to conquer us , nought then , they think ,</l>
     <l n="156">Will hinder , but Hesperia must be theirs ,</l>
     <l n="157">All theirs , from the upper to the nether sea .</l>
     <l n="158">Take then our friendship , and return us thine .</l>
     <l n="159">We too have courage , we have noble minds ,</l>
     <l n="160">And youth well tried , and exercised in arms . ”</l>
     <l n="161">Thus spoke Æneas — He with fix 'd regard</l>
     <l n="162">Survey 'd him speaking , features , form , and mien .</l>
     <l n="163">Then briefly thus — “ Thou noblest of thy name ,</l>
     <l n="164">How gladly do I take thee to my heart ,</l>
     <l n="165">How gladly thus confess thee for a friend !</l>
     <l n="166">In thee I trace Anchises ; his thy speech ,</l>
     <l n="167">Thy voice , thy countenance . For I well remember</l>
     <l n="168">Many a day since , when Priam journey 'd forth</l>
     <l n="169">To Salamis , to see the land where dwelt</l>
     <l n="170">Hesione , his sister , he push 'd on</l>
     <l n="171">E'en to Arcadia 's frozen bounds . ‘ Twas then</l>
     <l n="172">The bloom of youth was glowing on my cheek ;</l>
     <l n="173">Much I admired the Trojan chiefs , and much</l>
     <l n="174">Their king , the son of great Laomedon .</l>
     <l n="175">But most Anchises , towering o'er them all .</l>
     <l n="176">A youthful longing seized me to accost</l>
     <l n="177">The hero , and embrace him ; I drew near ,</l>
     <l n="178">And gladly led him to the walls of Pheneus .</l>
     <l n="179">Departing , he distinguish 'd me with gifts ,</l>
     <l n="180">A costly quiver stored with Lycian darts ,</l>
     <l n="181">A robe inwove with gold , with gold imboss 'd</l>
     <l n="182">Two bridles , those which Pallas uses now .</l>
     <l n="183">The friendly league thou hast solicited</l>
     <l n="184">I give thee , therefore , and to-morrow all</l>
     <l n="185">My chosen youth shall wait on your return .</l>
     <l n="186">Meanwhile , since thus in friendship ye are come ,</l>
     <l n="187">Rejoice with us , and join to celebrate</l>
     <l n="188">These annual rites , which may not be delay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="189">And be at once familiar at our board . ”</l>
     <l n="190">He said , and bade replace the feast removed ;</l>
     <l n="191">Himself upon a grassy bank disposed</l>
     <l n="192">The crew ; but for Æneas order 'd forth</l>
     <l n="193">A couch spread with a lion 's tawny shag ,</l>
     <l n="194">And bade him share the honours of his throne .</l>
     <l n="195">The appointed youth with glad alacrity</l>
     <l n="196">Assist the labouring priest to load the board</l>
     <l n="197">With roasted entrails of the slaughter 'd beeves ,</l>

     <l n="201">Hunger appeased , and tables all despatch 'd ,</l>
     <l n="202">Thus spake Evander : “ Superstition here ,</l>
     <l n="203">In this old solemn feasting , has no part .</l>
     <l n="204">No , Trojan friend , from utmost danger saved ,</l>
     <l n="205">In gratitude this worship we renew .</l>
     <l n="206">Behold that rock which nods above the vale ,</l>
     <l n="207">Those bulks of broken stone dispersed around ,</l>
     <l n="208">How desolate the shatter 'd cave appears ,</l>
     <l n="209">And what a ruin spreads the incumber 'd plain .</l>
     <l n="210">Within this pile , but far within , was once</l>
     <l n="211">The den of Cacus ; dire his hateful form</l>
     <l n="212">That shunn 'd the day , half monster and half man .</l>
     <l n="213">Blood newly shed stream 'd ever on the ground</l>
     <l n="214">Smoking , and many a visage pale and wan</l>
     <l n="215">Nail 'd at his gate , hung hideous to the sight .</l>
     <l n="216">Vulcan begot the brute : vast was his size ,</l>
     <l n="217">And from his throat he belch 'd his father 's fires .</l>
     <l n="218">But the day came that brought us what we wish 'd ,</l>
     <l n="219">The assistance and the presence of a God .</l>
     <l n="220">Flush 'd with his victory , and the spoils he won</l>
     <l n="221">From triple-form 'd Geryon lately slain ,</l>
     <l n="222">The great avenger , Hercules , appear 'd .</l>
     <l n="223">Hither he drove his stately bulls , and pour 'd</l>
     <l n="224">His herds along the vale . But the sly thief</l>
     <l n="225">Cacus , that nothing might escape his hand</l>
     <l n="226">Of villainy or fraud , drove from the stalls</l>
     <l n="227">Four of the lordliest of his bulls , and four</l>
     <l n="228">The fairest of his heifers ; by the tail</l>
     <l n="229">He dragg 'd them to his den , that , there conceal 'd ,</l>
     <l n="230">No footsteps might betray the dark abode .</l>
     <l n="231">And now , his herd with provender sufficed ,</l>
     <l n="232">Alcides would be gone : they as they went</l>
     <l n="233">Still bellowing loud , made the deep echoing woods</l>
     <l n="234">And distant hills resound : when , hark ! one ox ,</l>
     <l n="235">Imprison 'd close within the vast recess ,</l>
     <l n="236">Lows in return , and frustrates all his hope .</l>
     <l n="237">Then fury seized Alcides , and his breast</l>
     <l n="238">With indignation heaved : grasping his club</l>
     <l n="239">Of knotted oak , swift to the mountain top</l>
     <l n="240">He ran , he flew . Then first was Cacus seen</l>
     <l n="241">To tremble , and his eyes bespoke his fears .</l>
     <l n="242">Swift as an eastern blast , he sought his den ,</l>
     <l n="243">And dread , increasing , winged him as he went .</l>
     <l n="244">Drawn up in iron slings above the gate ,</l>
     <l n="245">A rock was hung enormous . Such his haste ,</l>
     <l n="246">He burst the chains , and dropp 'd it at the door ,</l>
     <l n="247">Then grappled it with iron work within</l>
     <l n="248">Of bolts and bars by Vulcan 's art contrived .</l>
     <l n="249">Scarce was he fast , when , panting for revenge ,</l>
     <l n="250">Came Hercules ; he gnash 'd his teeth with rage ,</l>
     <l n="251">And quick as lightning glanced his eyes around</l>
     <l n="252">In quest of entrance . Fiery red and stung</l>
     <l n="253">With indignation , thrice he wheeled his course</l>
     <l n="254">About the mountain ; thrice , but thrice in vain ,</l>
     <l n="255">He strove to force the quarry at the gate ,</l>
     <l n="256">And thrice sat down o'erwearied in the vale .</l>
     <l n="257">There stood a pointed rock , abrupt and rude ,</l>
     <l n="258">That high o'erlook ' d the rest , close at the back</l>
     <l n="259">Of the fell monster 's den , where birds obscene</l>
     <l n="260">Of ominous note resorted , choughs and daws .</l>
     <l n="261">This , as it lean 'd obliquely to the left ,</l>
     <l n="262">Threatening the stream below , he from the right</l>
     <l n="263">Push 'd with his utmost strength , and to and fro</l>
     <l n="264">He shook the mass , loosening its lowest base ;</l>
     <l n="265">Then shoved it from its seat ; down fell the pile ;</l>
     <l n="266">Sky thunder 'd at the fall ; the banks give way ,</l>
     <l n="267">The affrighted stream flows upward to his source .</l>
     <l n="268">Behold the kennel of the brute exposed ,</l>
     <l n="269">The gloomy vault laid open . So , if chance</l>
     <l n="270">Earth yawning to the centre should disclose</l>
     <l n="271">The mansions , the pale mansions of the dead ,</l>
     <l n="272">Loathed by the gods , such would the gulf appear ,</l>
     <l n="273">And the ghosts tremble at the sight of day .</l>
     <l n="274">The monster braying with unusual din</l>
     <l n="275">Within his hollow lair , and sore amazed</l>
     <l n="276">To see such sudden inroads of the light ,</l>
     <l n="277">Alcides press 'd him close with what at hand</l>
     <l n="278">Lay readiest , stumps of trees , and fragments huge</l>
     <l n="279">Of millstone size . He , ( for escape was none ,)</l>
     <l n="280">Wondrous to tell ! forth from his gorge discharged</l>
     <l n="281">A smoky cloud that darken 'd all the den ;</l>
     <l n="282">Wreath after wreath he vomited amain ,</l>
     <l n="283">The smothering vapour mix 'd with fiery sparks .</l>
     <l n="284">No sight could penetrate the veil obscure .</l>
     <l n="285">The hero , more provoked , endured not this ,</l>
     <l n="286">But with a headlong leap he rush 'd to where</l>
     <l n="287">The thickest cloud enveloped his abode .</l>
     <l n="288">There grasp 'd he Cacus , spite of all his fires ,</l>
     <l n="289">Till , crush 'd within his arms , the monster shows</l>
     <l n="290">His bloodless throat , now dry with panting hard ,</l>
     <l n="291">And his press 'd eyeballs start . Soon he tears down</l>
     <l n="292">The barricade of rock , the dark abyss</l>
     <l n="293">Lies open ; and the imprison 'd bulls , the theft</l>
     <l n="294">He had with oaths denied , are brought to light ;</l>
     <l n="295">By the heels the miscreant carcass is dragg 'd forth ,</l>
     <l n="296">His face , his eyes , all terrible , his breast</l>
     <l n="297">Beset with bristles , and his sooty jaws</l>
     <l n="298">Are view 'd with wonder never to be cloy 'd .</l>
     <l n="299">Hence the celebrity thou seest , and hence</l>
     <l n="300">This festal day Potitius first enjoin 'd</l>
     <l n="301">Posterity : these solemn rites he first ,</l>
     <l n="302">With those who bear the great Pinarian name ,</l>
     <l n="303">To Hercules devoted ; in the grove</l>
     <l n="304">This altar built , deem 'd sacred in the highest</l>
     <l n="305">By us , and sacred ever to be deem 'd .</l>
     <l n="306">Come , then , my friends , and bind your youthful brows</l>
     <l n="307">In praise of such deliverance , and hold forth</l>
     <l n="308">The brimming cup ; your deities and ours</l>
     <l n="309">Are now the same , then drink and freely too . ”</l>
     <l n="310">So saying , he twisted round his reverend locks</l>
     <l n="311">A variegated poplar wreath , and fill 'd</l>
     <l n="312">His right hand with a consecrated bowl .</l>
     <l n="313">At once all pour libations on the board ,</l>
     <l n="314">All offer prayer . And now , the radiant sphere</l>
     <l n="315">Of day descending , eventide drew near .</l>
     <l n="316">When first Potitius with the priests advanced ,</l>
     <l n="317">Begirt with skins , and torches in their hands .</l>
     <l n="318">High piled with meats of savoury taste , they ranged</l>
     <l n="319">The chargers , and renew 'd the grateful feast .</l>
     <l n="320">Then came the Salii , crown 'd with poplar too ,</l>
     <l n="321">Circling the blazing altars ; here the youth</l>
     <l n="322">Advanced , a choir harmonious , there were heard</l>
     <l n="323">The reverend seers responsive ; praise they sung ,</l>
     <l n="324">Much praise in honour of Alcides ’ deeds ;</l>
     <l n="325">How first with infant gripe two serpents huge</l>
     <l n="326">He strangled , sent from Juno ; next they sung ,</l>
     <l n="327">How Troja and OEchalia he destroy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="328">Fair cities both , and many a toilsome task</l>
     <l n="329">Beneath Eurystheus ( so his stepdame will 'd )</l>
     <l n="330">Achieved victorious . Thou , the cloud-born pair ,</l>
     <l n="331">Hylæus fierce and Pholus , monstrous twins ,</l>
     <l n="332">Thou slew'st the minotaur , the plague of Crete ,</l>
     <l n="333">And the vast lion of the Nemean rock ,</l>
     <l n="334">Thee hell , and Cerberus , hell 's porter , fear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="335">Stretch 'd in his den upon his half-gnaw 'd bones .</l>
     <l n="336">Thee no abhorred form , not e'en the vast</l>
     <l n="337">Typhoeus could appal , though clad in arms .</l>
     <l n="338">Hail , true-born son of Jove , among the gods</l>
     <l n="339">At length enroll 'd , nor least illustrious thou ,</l>
     <l n="340">Haste thee propitious , and approve our songs .</l>
     <l n="341">Thus hymn 'd the chorus ; above all they sing</l>
     <l n="342">The cave of Cacus , and the flames he breathed .</l>
     <l n="343">The whole grove echoes , and the hills rebound .</l>
     <l n="344">The rites perform 'd , all hasten to the town .</l>
     <l n="345">The king , bending with age , held as he went</l>
     <l n="346">Æneas and his Pallas by the hand ,</l>
     <l n="347">With much variety of pleasing talk</l>
     <l n="348">Shortening the way . Æneas , with a smile ,</l>
     <l n="349">Looks round him , charm 'd with the delightful scene</l>
     <l n="350">And many a question asks , and much he learns</l>
     <l n="351">Of heroes far renown 'd in ancient times .</l>
     <l n="352">Then spake Evander . These extensive groves ,</l>
     <l n="353">Were once inhabited by fauns and nymphs ,</l>
     <l n="354">Produced beneath their shades , and a rude race</l>
     <l n="355">Of men , the progeny uncouth of elms</l>
     <l n="356">And knotted oaks . They no refinement knew</l>
     <l n="357">Of laws or manners civilized , to yoke</l>
     <l n="358">The steer , with forecast provident to store</l>
     <l n="359">The hoarded grain , or manage what they had ,</l>
     <l n="360">But browsed like beasts upon the leafy boughs ,</l>
     <l n="361">Or fed voracious on their hunted prey .</l>
     <l n="362">An exile from Olympus , and expell 'd</l>
     <l n="363">His native realm by thunder-bearing Jove ,</l>
     <l n="364">First Saturn came . He from the mountains drew</l>
     <l n="365">This herd of men untractable and fierce ,</l>
     <l n="366">And gave them laws : and call 'd his hiding-place ,</l>
     <l n="367">This growth of forests , Latium . Such the peace</l>
     <l n="368">His land possess 'd , the golden age was then ,</l>
     <l n="369">So famed in story ; till by slow degrees</l>

     <l n="371">Succeeded , thirst of gold and thirst of blood .</l>
     <l n="372">Then came Ausonian bands , and armed hosts</l>
     <l n="373">From Sicily , and Latium often changed</l>
     <l n="374">Her master and her name . At length arose</l>
     <l n="375">Kings , of whom Tybris of gigantic form</l>
     <l n="376">Was chief ; and we Italians since have call 'd</l>
     <l n="377">The river by his name ; thus Albula</l>

     <l n="3">‘ Twas a long journey lay before us ,</l>

     <l n="5">Who far in point of rhetoric</l>
     <l n="6">Surpasses every living Greek ,</l>
     <l n="7">Each leaving our respective home ,</l>
     <l n="8">Together sallied forth from Rome .</l>
     <l n="9">First at Aricia we alight ,</l>
     <l n="10">And there refresh , and pass the night ,</l>
     <l n="11">Our entertainment rather coarse</l>
     <l n="12">Than sumptuous , but I 've met with worse .</l>
     <l n="13">Thence o'er the causeway soft and fair</l>
     <l n="14">To Appii Forum we repair .</l>
     <l n="15">But as this road is well supplied</l>
     <l n="16">( Temptation strong ! ) on either side</l>
     <l n="17">With inns commodious , snug , and warm ,</l>
     <l n="18">We split the journey , and perform</l>
     <l n="19">In two days ’ time what 's often done</l>
     <l n="20">By brisker travellers in one .</l>
     <l n="21">Here , rather choosing not to sup</l>
     <l n="22">Than with bad water mix my cup ,</l>
     <l n="23">After a warm debate in spite</l>
     <l n="24">Of a provoking appetite ,</l>
     <l n="25">I sturdily resolved at last</l>
     <l n="26">To balk it , and pronounce a fast ,</l>
     <l n="27">And in a moody humour wait ,</l>
     <l n="28">While my less dainty comrades bait .</l>
     <l n="29">Now o'er the spangled hemisphere</l>
     <l n="30">Diffused the starry train appear ,</l>
     <l n="31">When there arose a desperate brawl ;</l>
     <l n="32">The slaves and bargemen , one and all ,</l>
     <l n="33">Rending their throats ( have mercy on us ! )</l>
     <l n="34">As if they were resolved to stun us .</l>
     <l n="35">“ Steer the barge this way to the shore ;</l>
     <l n="36">I tell you we 'll admit no more ;</l>
     <l n="37">Plague ! will you never be content ? ”</l>
     <l n="38">Thus a whole hour at least is spent ,</l>
     <l n="39">While they receive the several fares ,</l>
     <l n="40">And kick the mule into his gears .</l>
     <l n="41">Happy , these difficulties past ,</l>
     <l n="42">Could we have fallen asleep at last !</l>
     <l n="43">But , what with humming , croaking , biting ,</l>
     <l n="44">Gnats , frogs , and all their plagues uniting ,</l>
     <l n="45">These tuneful natives of the lake</l>
     <l n="46">Conspired to keep us broad awake .</l>
     <l n="47">Besides , to make the concert full ,</l>
     <l n="48">Two maudlin wights , exceeding dull ,</l>
     <l n="49">The bargeman and a passenger ,</l>
     <l n="50">Each in his turn , essay 'd an air</l>
     <l n="51">In honour of his absent fair .</l>
     <l n="52">At length the passenger , opprest</l>
     <l n="53">With wine , left off , and snored the rest .</l>
     <l n="54">The weary bargeman too gave o'er ,</l>
     <l n="55">And , hearing his companion snore ,</l>
     <l n="56">Seized the occasion , fix 'd the barge ,</l>
     <l n="57">Turn 'd out his mule to graze at large ,</l>
     <l n="58">And slept forgetful of his charge .</l>
     <l n="59">And now the sun o'er eastern hill</l>
     <l n="60">Discover 'd that our barge stood still ;</l>
     <l n="61">When one , whose anger vex 'd him sore ,</l>
     <l n="62">With malice fraught , leaps quick on shore ;</l>
     <l n="63">Plucks up a stake , with many a thwack</l>
     <l n="64">Assails the mule and driver 's back .</l>
     <l n="65">Then slowly moving on with pain ,</l>
     <l n="66">At ten Feronia 's stream we gain ,</l>
     <l n="67">And in her pure and glassy wave</l>
     <l n="68">Our hands and faces gladly lave .</l>
     <l n="69">Climbing three miles , fair Anxur 's height</l>
     <l n="70">We reach , with stony quarries white .</l>
     <l n="71">While here , as was agreed , we wait ,</l>
     <l n="72">Till , charged with business of the state ,</l>
     <l n="73">Mæcenas and Cocceius come ,</l>
     <l n="74">The messengers of peace from Rome .</l>
     <l n="75">My eyes , by watery humours blear</l>
     <l n="76">And sore , I with black balsam smear .</l>
     <l n="77">At length they join us , and with them</l>
     <l n="78">Our worthy friend Fonteius came ;</l>
     <l n="79">A man of such complete desert ,</l>
     <l n="80">Antony loved him at his heart .</l>
     <l n="81">At Fundi we refused to bait ,</l>
     <l n="82">And laugh 'd at vain Aufidius ’ state ,</l>
     <l n="83">A prætor now , a scribe before ,</l>
     <l n="84">The purple-border 'd robe he wore ,</l>
     <l n="85">His slave the smoking censer bore .</l>
     <l n="86">Tired , at Muræna 's we repose ,</l>
     <l n="87">At Formia sup at Capito 's .</l>
     <l n="88">With smiles the rising morn we greet ,</l>
     <l n="89">At Sinuessa pleased to meet</l>
     <l n="90">With Plotius , Varius , and the bard</l>
     <l n="91">Whom Mantua first with wonder heard .</l>
     <l n="92">The world no purer spirits knows ;</l>
     <l n="93">For none my heart more warmly glows .</l>
     <l n="94">O ! what embraces we bestow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="95">And with what joy our breasts o'erflow ' d !</l>
     <l n="96">Sure , while my sense is sound and clear ,</l>
     <l n="97">Long as I live , I shall prefer</l>
     <l n="98">A gay , good-natured , easy friend</l>
     <l n="99">To every blessing Heaven can send .</l>
     <l n="100">At a small village , the next night ,</l>
     <l n="101">Near the Vulturnus we alight ;</l>
     <l n="102">Where , as employ 'd on state affairs ,</l>
     <l n="103">We were supplied by the purveyors ,</l>
     <l n="104">Frankly at once , and without hire ,</l>
     <l n="105">With food for man and horse , and fire .</l>
     <l n="106">Capua next day betimes we reach ,</l>

     <l n="108">Labour 'd with different maladies ,</l>
     <l n="109">His such a stomach , mine such eyes ,</l>

     <l n="111">In drowsy mood to sleep resort ;</l>
     <l n="112">Mæcenas to the tennis-court .</l>
     <l n="113">Next at Cocceius ’ farm we 're treated ,</l>
     <l n="114">Above the Caudian tavern seated ;</l>
     <l n="115">His kind and hospitable board</l>
     <l n="116">With choice of wholesome food was stored .</l>
     <l n="117">Now , O ye Nine , inspire my lays !</l>
     <l n="118">To nobler themes my fancy raise !</l>
     <l n="119">Two combatants , who scorn to yield</l>
     <l n="120">The noisy , tongue-disputed field ,</l>
     <l n="121">Sarmentus and Cicirrus , claim</l>
     <l n="122">A poet 's tribute to their fame ;</l>
     <l n="123">Cicirrus of true Oscian breed ,</l>
     <l n="124">Sarmentus , who was never freed ,</l>
     <l n="125">But ran away . We do n't defame him ;</l>
     <l n="126">His lady lives , and still may claim him .</l>
     <l n="127">Thus dignified , in harder fray</l>
     <l n="128">These champions their keen wit display ,</l>
     <l n="129">And first Sarmentus led the way .</l>
     <l n="130">“ Thy locks , ” quoth he , “ so rough and coarse ,</l>
     <l n="131">Look like the mane of some wild horse . ”</l>
     <l n="132">We laugh ; Cicirrus undismay 'd —</l>
     <l n="133">“ Have at you ! ” — cries , and shakes his head .</l>
     <l n="134">“ ‘ Tis well , ” Sarmentus says , “ you 've lost</l>
     <l n="135">That horn your forehead once could boast ;</l>
     <l n="136">Since , maim 'd and mangled as you are ,</l>
     <l n="137">You seem to butt . ” A hideous scar</l>
     <l n="138">Improved , ‘ tis true , with double grace</l>
     <l n="139">The native horrors of his face .</l>
     <l n="140">Well , after much jocosely said</l>
     <l n="141">Of his grim front , so fiery red ,</l>
     <l n="142">( For carbuncles had blotch 'd it o'er</l>
     <l n="143">As usual on Campania 's shore ,)</l>
     <l n="144">“ Give us , ” he cried , “ since you 're so big ,</l>
     <l n="145">A sample of the Cyclop 's jig !</l>
     <l n="146">Your shanks methinks no buskins ask ,</l>
     <l n="147">Nor does your phiz require a mask . ”</l>
     <l n="148">To this Cicirrus : “ In return</l>
     <l n="149">Of you , sir , now I fain would learn ,</l>
     <l n="150">When ‘ twas , no longer deem 'd a slave ,</l>
     <l n="151">Your chains you to the Lares gave ?</l>
     <l n="152">For though a scrivener 's right you claim ,</l>
     <l n="153">Your lady 's title is the same .</l>
     <l n="154">But what could make you run away ,</l>
     <l n="155">Since , pigmy as you are , each day</l>
     <l n="156">A single pound of bread would quite</l>
     <l n="157">O'erpower your puny appetite ? ”</l>
     <l n="158">Thus joked the champions , while we laugh 'd ,</l>
     <l n="159">And many a cheerful bumper quaff 'd .</l>
     <l n="160">To Beneventum next we steer ;</l>
     <l n="161">Where our good host by over care</l>
     <l n="162">In roasting thrushes lean as mice</l>
     <l n="163">Had almost fallen a sacrifice .</l>
     <l n="164">The kitchen soon was all on fire ,</l>
     <l n="165">And to the roof the flames aspire ;</l>
     <l n="166">There might you see each man and master</l>
     <l n="167">Striving , amidst this sad disaster ,</l>
     <l n="168">To save the supper . Then they came</l>
     <l n="169">With speed enough to quench the flame .</l>
     <l n="170">From hence we first at distance see</l>
     <l n="171">The Apulian hills , well known to me ,</l>
     <l n="172">Parch 'd by the sultry western blast ;</l>
     <l n="173">And which we never should have past ,</l>
     <l n="174">Had not Trivicius by the way</l>
     <l n="175">Received us at the close of day .</l>
     <l n="176">But each was forced at entering here</l>
     <l n="177">To pay the tribute of a tear ,</l>
     <l n="178">For more of smoke than fire was seen —</l>
     <l n="179">The hearth was piled with logs so green .</l>
     <l n="180">From hence in chaises we were carried</l>

     <l n="182">At a small town , whose name my verse</l>
     <l n="183">( So barbarous is it ) can n't rehearse .</l>
     <l n="184">Know it you may by many a sign ,</l>
     <l n="185">Water is dearer far than wine ;</l>
     <l n="186">There bread is deem 'd such dainty fare ,</l>
     <l n="187">That every prudent traveller</l>
     <l n="188">His wallet loads with many a crust ;</l>
     <l n="189">For at Canusium you might just</l>
     <l n="190">As well attempt to gnaw a stone</l>
     <l n="191">As think to get a morsel down :</l>
     <l n="192">That too with scanty streams is fed ;</l>
     <l n="193">Its founder was brave Diomed .</l>
     <l n="194">Good Varius ( ah , that friends must part ! )</l>
     <l n="195">Here left us all with aching heart .</l>
     <l n="196">At Rubi we arrived that day ,</l>
     <l n="197">Well jaded by the length of way ,</l>

     <l n="199">Next day no weather could be better ;</l>
     <l n="200">No roads so bad ; we scarce could crawl</l>
     <l n="201">Along to fishy Barium 's wall .</l>
     <l n="202">The Egnatians next , who by the rules</l>
     <l n="203">Of common sense are knaves or fools ,</l>
     <l n="204">Made all our sides with laughter heave ,</l>
     <l n="205">Since we with them must needs believe</l>
     <l n="206">That incense in their temples burns ,</l>
     <l n="207">And without fire to ashes turns .</l>
     <l n="208">To circumcision 's bigots tell</l>
     <l n="209">Such tales ! for me , I know full well</l>
     <l n="210">That in high heaven , unmoved by care ,</l>
     <l n="211">The gods eternal quiet share :</l>
     <l n="212">Nor can I deem their spleen the cause ,</l>
     <l n="213">While fickle Nature breaks her laws .</l>
     <l n="214">Brundusium last we reach : and there</l>
     <l n="215">Stop short the muse and traveller .</l>

    <head>THE NINTH SATIRE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE .</head>
    <head>DESCRIPTION OF AN IMPERTINENT . ADAPTED TO THE PRESENT TIMES , 1759 .</head>
     <l n="1">Sauntering along the street one day ,</l>
     <l n="2">On trifles musing by the way —</l>
     <l n="3">Up steps a free familiar wight ,</l>
     <l n="4">( I scarcely knew the man by sight . )</l>
     <l n="5">“ Carlos , ” he cried , “ your hand , my dear ;</l>
     <l n="6">Gad , I rejoice to meet you here !</l>
     <l n="7">Pray Heaven I see you well ? ” “ So , so ;</l>
     <l n="8">E'en well enough as times now go :</l>
     <l n="9">The same good wishes , sir , to you . ”</l>
     <l n="10">Finding he still pursued me close —</l>
     <l n="11">“ Sir , you have business I suppose . ”</l>
     <l n="12">“ My business , sir , is quickly done ,</l>
     <l n="13">‘ Tis but to make my merit known .</l>
     <l n="14">Sir , I have read ” — “ O learned sir ,</l>
     <l n="15">You and your learning I revere . ”</l>
     <l n="16">Then sweating with anxiety ,</l>
     <l n="17">And sadly longing to get free ,</l>
     <l n="18">Gods , how I scamper 'd , scuffled for't ,</l>
     <l n="19">Ran , halted , ran again , stopp 'd short ,</l>
     <l n="20">Beckon 'd my boy , and pull 'd him near ,</l>
     <l n="21">And whisper 'd nothing in his ear .</l>
     <l n="22">Teased with his loose unjointed chat —</l>
     <l n="23">“ What street is this ? What house is that ? ”</l>
     <l n="24">O Harlow , how I envied thee</l>
     <l n="25">Thy unabash 'd effrontery ,</l>
     <l n="26">Who darest a foe with freedom blame ,</l>
     <l n="27">And call a coxcomb by his name !</l>
     <l n="28">When I return 'd him answer none ,</l>
     <l n="29">Obligingly the fool ran on ,</l>
     <l n="30">“ I see you 're dismally distress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">Would give the world to be released .</l>
     <l n="32">But by your leave , Sir , I shall still</l>
     <l n="33">Stick to your skirts , do what you will .</l>
     <l n="34">Pray which way does your journey tend ? ”</l>
     <l n="35">“ O , ‘ tis a tedious way , my friend ;</l>
     <l n="36">Across the Thames , the Lord knows where ,</l>
     <l n="37">I would not trouble you so far . ”</l>
     <l n="38">“ Well , I 'm at leisure to attend you . ”</l>
     <l n="39">“ Are you ? ” thought I , “ the Deil befriend you . ”</l>
     <l n="40">No ass with double panniers rack 'd ,</l>
     <l n="41">Oppress 'd , o'erladen , broken-back 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">E'er look 'd a thousandth part so dull</l>
     <l n="43">As I , nor half so like a fool .</l>
     <l n="44">“ Sir , I know little of myself ,</l>
     <l n="45">( Proceeds the pert conceited elf )</l>
     <l n="46">If Gray or Mason you will deem</l>
     <l n="47">Than me more worthy your esteem .</l>
     <l n="48">Poems I write by folios</l>
     <l n="49">As fast as other men write prose ;</l>
     <l n="50">Then I can sing so loud , so clear ,</l>
     <l n="51">That Beard cannot with me compare .</l>
     <l n="52">In dancing too I all surpass ,</l>
     <l n="53">Not Cooke can move with such a grace . ”</l>
     <l n="54">Here I made shift with much ado</l>
     <l n="55">To interpose a word or two .—</l>
     <l n="56">“ Have you no parents , sir , no friends ,</l>
     <l n="57">Whose welfare on your own depends ? ”</l>
     <l n="58">“ Parents , relations , say you ? No .</l>
     <l n="59">They 're all disposed of long ago . ” —</l>
     <l n="60">“ Happy to be no more perplex 'd !</l>
     <l n="61">My fate too threatens , I go next .</l>
     <l n="62">Despatch me , sir , ‘ tis now too late ,</l>
     <l n="63">Alas ! to struggle with my fate !</l>
     <l n="64">Well , I 'm convinced my time is come —</l>
     <l n="65">When young , a gipsy told my doom .</l>
     <l n="66">The beldame shook her palsied head ,</l>
     <l n="67">As she perused my palm , and said :</l>
     <l n="68">“ Of poison , pestilence , and war ,</l>
     <l n="69">Gout , stone , defluxion , or catarrh ,</l>
     <l n="70">You have no reason to beware .</l>
     <l n="71">Beware the coxcomb 's idle prate ;</l>
     <l n="72">Chiefly , my son , beware of that .</l>
     <l n="73">Be sure , when you behold him , fly</l>
     <l n="74">Out of all earshot , or you die . ”</l>
     <l n="75">To Rufus ’ Hall we now draw near</l>
     <l n="76">Where he was summoned to appear ,</l>
     <l n="77">Refute the charge the plaintiff brought ,</l>
     <l n="78">Or suffer judgment by default .</l>
     <l n="79">“ For Heaven 's sake , if you love me , wait</l>
     <l n="80">One moment ! I 'll be with you straight . ”</l>
     <l n="81">Glad of a plausible pretence —</l>
     <l n="82">“ Sir , I must beg you to dispense</l>
     <l n="83">With my attendance in the court .</l>
     <l n="84">My legs will surely suffer for't . ”</l>
     <l n="85">“ Nay , prithee , Carlos , stop awhile ! ”</l>
     <l n="86">“ Faith , sir , in law I have no skill .</l>
     <l n="87">Besides , I have no time to spare ,</l>
     <l n="88">I must be going you know where . ”</l>
     <l n="89">“ Well , I protest I 'm doubtful now</l>
     <l n="90">Whether to leave my suit or you ! ”</l>
     <l n="91">“ Me without scruple ! ” I reply ,</l>
     <l n="92">“ Me by all means , sir ! ” — “ No , not I .</l>
     <l n="93">Allons , Monsieur ! ” ‘ Twere vain , you know ,</l>
     <l n="94">To strive with a victorious foe .</l>
     <l n="95">So I reluctantly obey ,</l>
     <l n="96">And follow where he leads the way .</l>
     <l n="97">“ You and Newcastle are so close ,</l>
     <l n="98">Still hand and glove , sir — I suppose . ”</l>
     <l n="99">“ Newcastle , let me tell you , sir ,</l>
     <l n="100">Has not his equal every where . ”</l>
     <l n="101">“ Well . There indeed your fortune 's made :</l>
     <l n="102">Faith , sir , you understand your trade .</l>
     <l n="103">Would you but give me your good word :</l>
     <l n="104">Just introduce me to my lord ,</l>
     <l n="105">I should serve charmingly by way</l>
     <l n="106">Of second fiddle , as they say :</l>
     <l n="107">What think you , sir ? ‘ twere a good jest .</l>
     <l n="108">‘ Slife , we should quickly scout the rest . ”</l>
     <l n="109">“ Sir , you mistake the matter far ,</l>
     <l n="110">We have no second fiddles there —</l>
     <l n="111">Richer than I some folks may be ;</l>
     <l n="112">More learned , but it hurts not me .</l>
     <l n="113">Friends though he has of different kind ,</l>
     <l n="114">Each has his proper place assign 'd . ”</l>
     <l n="115">“ Strange matters these alleged by you ! ”</l>
     <l n="116">“ Strange they may be , but they are true . ”</l>
     <l n="117">“ Well then , I vow , ‘ tis mighty clever ,</l>
     <l n="118">Now I long ten times more than ever</l>
     <l n="119">To be advanced extremely near</l>
     <l n="120">One of his shining character .</l>
     <l n="121">Have but the will — there wants no more ,</l>
     <l n="122">‘ Tis plain enough you have the power .</l>
     <l n="123">His easy temper ( that 's the worst )</l>
     <l n="124">He knows , and is so shy at first . ” —</l>
     <l n="125">“ But such a cavalier as you —</l>
     <l n="126">Lord , sir , you 'll quickly bring him to ! ”</l>
     <l n="127">“ Well ; if I fail in my design ,</l>
     <l n="128">Sir , it shall be no fault of mine .</l>
     <l n="129">If by the saucy servile tribe</l>
     <l n="130">Denied , what think you of a bribe ?</l>
     <l n="131">Shut out to-day , not die with sorrow ,</l>
     <l n="132">But try my luck again to-morrow ;</l>
     <l n="133">Never attempt to visit him</l>
     <l n="134">But at the most convenient time ;</l>
     <l n="135">Attend him on each levee day ,</l>
     <l n="136">And there my humble duty pay —</l>
     <l n="137">Labour , like this , our want supplies ;</l>
     <l n="138">And they must stoop who mean to rise . ”</l>
     <l n="139">While thus he wittingly harangued ,</l>
     <l n="140">For which you 'll guess I wish 'd him hang 'd ,</l>
     <l n="141">Campley , a friend of mine , came by —</l>
     <l n="142">Who knew his humour more than I ;</l>
     <l n="143">We stop , salute , and — “ Why so fast ,</l>
     <l n="144">Friend Carlos ? Whither all this haste ? ” —</l>
     <l n="145">Fired at the thought of a reprieve ,</l>
     <l n="146">I pinch him , pull him , twitch his sleeve ,</l>
     <l n="147">Nod , beckon , bite my lips , wink , pout ,</l>
     <l n="148">Do every thing but speak plain out :</l>
     <l n="149">While he , sad dog , from the beginning</l>
     <l n="150">Determined to mistake my meaning ,</l>
     <l n="151">Instead of pitying my curse ,</l>
     <l n="152">By jeering made it ten times worse .</l>
     <l n="153">“ Campley , what secret ( pray ! ) was that</l>
     <l n="154">You wanted to communicate ? ”</l>
     <l n="155">“ I recollect . But ‘ tis no matter .</l>
     <l n="156">Carlos , we 'll talk of that hereafter .</l>
     <l n="157">E'en let the secret rest . ‘ Twill tell</l>
     <l n="158">Another time , sir , just as well . ”</l>
     <l n="159">Was ever such a dismal day ?</l>
     <l n="160">Unlucky cur , he steals away ,</l>
     <l n="161">And leaves me , half bereft of life ,</l>
     <l n="162">At mercy of the butcher 's knife ;</l>
     <l n="163">When sudden , shouting from afar ,</l>
     <l n="164">See his antagonist appear !</l>
     <l n="165">The bailiff seized him quick as thought ,</l>
     <l n="166">“ Ho , Mr. Scoundrel ! Are you caught ?</l>
     <l n="167">Sir , you are witness to the arrest . ”</l>
     <l n="168">“ Ay , marry , sir , I 'll do my best . ”</l>
     <l n="169">The mob huzzas . Away they trudge ,</l>
     <l n="170">Culprit and all , before the judge .</l>
     <l n="171">Meanwhile I luckily enough</l>
     <l n="172">( Thanks to Apollo ) got clear off .</l>

    <head>TRANSLATION OF AN EPIGRAM FROM HOMER .<span type="note_anchor">[ 922 ]</span></head>
    <head><span type="note_anchor">[ 922 ]</span>No title is prefixed to this piece , but it appears to be a translation of one of the Επιγραμματα of Homer called Ο Καμινος , or The Furnace . Herodotus , or whoever was the author of the Life of Homer ascribed to him , observes , “ certain potters , while they were busied in baking their ware , seeing Homer at a small distance , and having heard much said of his wisdom , called to him , and promised him a present of their commodity , and of such other things as they could afford , if he would sing to them , when he sang as follows . ”</head>

     <l n="1">Pay me my price , potters ! and I will sing .</l>
     <l n="2">Attend , O Pallas ! and with lifted arm</l>
     <l n="3">Protect their oven ; let the cups and all</l>
     <l n="4">The sacred vessels blacken well , and , baked</l>
     <l n="5">With good success , yield them both fair renown</l>
     <l n="6">And profit , whether in the market sold</l>
     <l n="7">Or streets , and let no strife ensue between us .</l>
     <l n="8">But , oh ye potters ! if with shameless front</l>
     <l n="9">Ye falsify your promise , then I leave</l>
     <l n="10">No mischief uninvoked to avenge the wrong .</l>
     <l n="11">Come , Syntrips , Smaragus , Sabactes , come ,</l>
     <l n="12">And Asbetus , nor let your direst dread ,</l>
     <l n="13">Omodamus , delay ! Fire seize your house ,</l>
     <l n="14">May neither house nor vestibule escape ,</l>
     <l n="15">May ye lament to see confusion mar</l>
     <l n="16">And mingle the whole labour of your hands ,</l>
     <l n="17">And may a sound fill all your oven , such</l>
     <l n="18">As of a horse grinding his provender ,</l>
     <l n="19">While all your pots and flagons bounce within .</l>
     <l n="20">Come hither , also , daughter of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="21">Circe the sorceress , and with thy drugs</l>
     <l n="22">Poison themselves , and all that they have made !</l>
     <l n="23">Come , also , Chiron , with thy numerous troop</l>
     <l n="24">Of centaurs , as well those who died beneath</l>
     <l n="25">The club of Hercules , as who escaped ,</l>
     <l n="26">And stamp their crockery to dust ; down fall</l>
     <l n="27">Their chimney ; let them see it with their eyes ,</l>
     <l n="28">And howl to see the ruin of their art ,</l>
     <l n="29">While I rejoice ; and if a potter stoop</l>
     <l n="30">To peep into his furnace , may the fire</l>
     <l n="31">Flash in his face and scorch it , that all men</l>
     <l n="32">Observe , thenceforth , equity and good faith .</l>

    <head>ON THE ICE ISLANDS SEEN FLOATING IN THE GERMAN OCEAN .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">What portents , from what distant region , ride ,</l>
     <l n="2">Unseen till now in ours , the astonish 'd tide ?</l>
     <l n="3">In ages past , old Proteus , with his droves</l>
     <l n="4">Of sea-calves , sought the mountains and the groves .</l>
     <l n="5">But now , descending whence of late they stood ,</l>
     <l n="6">Themselves the mountains seem to rove the flood .</l>
     <l n="7">Dire times were they , full charged with human woes ;</l>
     <l n="8">And these , scarce less calamitous than those .</l>
     <l n="9">What view we now ? More wondrous still ! Behold !</l>
     <l n="10">Like burnish 'd brass they shine , or beaten gold ;</l>
     <l n="11">And all around the pearl 's pure splendour show ,</l>
     <l n="12">And all around the ruby 's fiery glow .</l>
     <l n="13">Come they from India , where the burning earth ,</l>
     <l n="14">All bounteous , gives her richest treasures birth ;</l>
     <l n="15">And where the costly gems , that beam around</l>
     <l n="16">The brows of mightiest potentates , are found ?</l>
     <l n="17">No . Never such a countless dazzling store</l>
     <l n="18">Had left unseen the Ganges ’ peopled shore .</l>
     <l n="19">Rapacious hands , and ever watchful eyes ,</l>
     <l n="20">Should sooner far have mark 'd and seized the prize .</l>
     <l n="21">Whence sprang they then ? Ejected have they come</l>
     <l n="22">From Vesuvius ’ , or from Ætna 's burning womb ?</l>
     <l n="23">Thus shine they self-illumed , or but display</l>
     <l n="24">The borrow 'd splendours of a cloudless day ?</l>
     <l n="25">With borrow 'd beams they shine . The gales that breathe</l>
     <l n="26">Now landward , and the current 's force beneath ,</l>
     <l n="27">Have borne them nearer : and the nearer sight ,</l>
     <l n="28">Advantaged more , contemplates them aright .</l>
     <l n="29">Their lofty summits crested high they show ,</l>
     <l n="30">With mingled sleet , and long-incumbent snow .</l>
     <l n="31">The rest is ice . Far hence , where , most severe ,</l>
     <l n="32">Bleak winter well nigh saddens all the year ,</l>
     <l n="33">Their infant growth began . He bade arise</l>
     <l n="34">Their uncouth forms , portentous in our eyes .</l>
     <l n="35">Oft as dissolved by transient suns , the snow</l>
     <l n="36">Left the tall cliff , to join the flood below ;</l>
     <l n="37">He caught , and curdled with a freezing blast</l>
     <l n="38">The current , ere it reach 'd the boundless waste .</l>
     <l n="39">By slow degrees uprose the wondrous pile ,</l>
     <l n="40">And long successive ages roll 'd the while ;</l>
     <l n="41">Till , ceaseless in its growth , it claim 'd to stand ,</l>
     <l n="42">Tall as its rival mountains on the land .</l>
     <l n="43">Thus stood , and , unremovable by skill</l>
     <l n="44">Or force of man , had stood the structure still ,</l>
     <l n="45">But that , though firmly fix 'd , supplanted yet</l>
     <l n="46">By pressure of its own enormous weight ,</l>
     <l n="47">It left the shelving beach — and , with a sound</l>
     <l n="48">That shook the bellowing waves and rocks around ,</l>
     <l n="49">Self-launch 'd , and swiftly , to the briny wave ,</l>
     <l n="50">As if instinct with strong desire to lave ,</l>
     <l n="51">Down went the ponderous mass . So bards of old</l>
     <l n="52">How Delos swam the Ægean deep have told .</l>
     <l n="53">But not of ice was Delos . Delos bore</l>
     <l n="54">Herb , fruit , and flower . She , crown 'd with laurel , wore ,</l>
     <l n="55">E'en under wintry skies , a summer smile ;</l>
     <l n="56">And Delos was Apollo 's favourite isle .</l>
     <l n="57">But , horrid wanderers of the deep , to you</l>
     <l n="58">He deems Cimmerian darkness only due .</l>
     <l n="59">Your hated birth he deign 'd not to survey ,</l>
     <l n="60">But , scornful , turn 'd his glorious eyes away .</l>
     <l n="61">Hence , seek your home , nor longer rashly dare</l>
     <l n="62">The darts of Phoebus and a softer air ;</l>
     <l n="63">Lest ye regret , too late , your native coast ,</l>
     <l n="64">In no congenial gulf for ever lost !</l>

   <p>As Cowper 's Version of Homer is not included in this Edition of his Works , it seems necessary to assign the reasons which have led to the omission .</p>
   <p>Distinguished as this Version unquestionably is , beyond any preceding attempt , for its fidelity and close adherence to the Grecian Bard , as well as for other excellences which have already been specified , it has still failed in securing an adequate reception from the British public . In the religious portion of the community it is well known that a very general sentiment of regret exists that the author of the Task , whose muse was capable of such high moral flights , should have consumed so many years in this laborious enterprise . Under these circumstances , its re-publication here , appeared to be undesirable , especially as it would have added one-third to the cost of the present Edition , and as editions of Cowper 's Homer are already before the public , and accessible to all who attach an interest to this portion of the Poet 's Works .</p>

     <l n="1">Leaky at bottom ; if those chinks you stop ,</l>
     <l n="2">In vain — the secret will run o'er at top .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There is no mark of our confidence taken more kindly by a friend than the entrusting him with a secret , nor any which he is so likely to abuse . Confidants in general are like crazy firelocks , which are no sooner charged and cocked than the spring gives way , and the report immediately follows . Happy to have been thought worthy the confidence of one friend , they are impatient to manifest their importance to another ; till , between them and their friend and their friend 's friend , the whole matter is presently known to all our friends round the Wrekin . The secret catches as it were by contact , and like electrical matter breaks forth from every link in the chain , almost at the same instant . Thus the whole Exchange may be thrown into a buzz to-morrow , by what was whispered in the middle of Marlborough Downs this morning ; and in a week 's time the streets may ring with the intrigue of a woman of fashion , bellowed out from the foul mouths of the hawkers , though at present it is known to no creature living but her gallant and her waiting maid .</p>
   <p>As the talent of secresy is of so great importance to society , and the necessary commerce between individuals cannot be securely carried on without it , that this deplorable weakness should be so general is much to be lamented . You may as well pour water into a funnel or sieve , and expect it to be retained there , as commit any of your concerns to so slippery a companion . It is remarkable that , in those men who have thus lost the faculty of retention , the desire of being communicative is always most prevalent where it is least justified . If they are entrusted with a matter of no great moment , affairs of more consequence will perhaps in a few hours shuffle it entirely out of their thoughts ; but if any thing be delivered to them with an earnestness , a low voice , and the gesture of a man in terror for the consequence of its being known ; if the door is bolted , and every precaution taken to prevent surprise , however they may promise secresy , and however they may intend it , the weight upon their minds will be so extremely oppressive , that it will certainly put their tongues in motion .</p>
   <p>This breach of trust , so universal amongst us , is perhaps , in great measure owing to our education . The first lesson our little masters and misses are taught is to become blabs and tell-tales : they are bribed to divulge the petty intrigues of the family below stairs to papa and mamma in the parlour , and a doll or hobby-horse is generally the encouragement of a propensity , which could scarcely be atoned for by a whipping . As soon as children can lisp out the little intelligence they have picked up in the hall or the kitchen , they are admired for their wit ; if the butler has been caught kissing the housekeeper in his pantry , or the footman detected in romping with the chamber-maid , away flies little Tommy or Betsy with the news ; the parents are lost in admiration of the pretty rogue 's understanding , and reward such uncommon ingenuity with a kiss or a sugar-plum .</p>
   <p>Nor does an inclination to secresy meet with less encouragement at school . The gouvernantes at the boarding-school teach miss to be a good girl , and tell them every thing she knows : thus , if any young lady is unfortunately discovered eating a green apple in a corner : if she is heard to pronounce a naughty word , or is caught picking the letters out of another miss 's sampler ; away runs the chit who is so happy as to get the start of the rest , screams out her information as she goes ; and the prudent matron chucks her under the chin , and tells her that she is a good girl and every body will love her .</p>
   <p>The management of our young gentlemen is equally absurd ; in most of our schools , if a lad is discovered in a scrape , the impeachment of an accomplice , as at the Old Bailey , is made the condition of a pardon . I remember a boy , engaged in robbing an orchard , who was unfortunately taken prisoner in an apple-tree , and conducted , under the strong guard of the farmer and his dairy-maid to the master 's house . Upon his absolute refusal to discover his associates , the pedagogue undertook to lash him out of his fidelity ; but , finding it impossible to scourge the secret out of him , he at last gave him up for an obstinate villain , and sent him to his father , who told him he was ruined , and was going to disinherit him for not betraying his school-fellows .</p>
   <p>I must own I am not fond of thus drubbing our youths into treachery ; and am much pleased with the request of Ulysses , when he went to Troy , who begged of those who were to have the care of young Telemachus , that they would above all things teach him to be just , sincere , faithful , and to keep a secret .</p>
   <p>Every man 's experience must have furnished him with instances of confidants who are not to be relied on , and friends who are not to be trusted ; but few perhaps have thought it a character so well worth their attention , as to have marked out the different degrees into which it may be divided , and the different methods by which secrets are communicated .</p>
   <p>Ned Trusty is a tell-tale of a very singular kind . Having some sense of his duty , he hesitates a little at the breach of it . If he engages never to utter a syllable , he most punctually performs his promise ; but then he has the knack of insinuating by a nod , and a shrug well-timed , or a seasonable leer , as much as others can convey in express terms . It is difficult , in short , to determine whether he is more to be admired for his resolution in not mentioning , or his ingenuity in disclosing , a secret . He is also excellent at a doubtful phrase , as Hamlet calls it , or ambiguous giving out , and his conversation consists chiefly of such broken inuendoes as — “ well I know — or I could — and if I would — or , if I list to speak — or there be , and if there might , ” &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Here he generally stops ; and leaves it to his hearers to draw proper inferences from these piecemeal premises . With due encouragement however he may be prevailed on to slip the padlock from his lips , and immediately overwhelms you with a torrent of secret history , which rushes forth with more violence for having been so long confined .</p>
   <p>Poor Meanwell , though he never fails to transgress , is rather to be pitied than condemned . To trust him with a secret is to spoil his appetite , to break his rest , and to deprive him for a time of every earthly enjoyment . Like a man who travels with his whole fortune in his pocket , he is terrified if you approach him , and immediately suspects that you come with a felonious intention to rob him of his charge . If he ventures abroad , it is to walk in some unfrequented place , where he is least in danger of an attack . At home , he shuts himself up from his family , paces to and fro his chamber , and has no relief but from muttering over to himself what he longs to publish to the world ; and would gladly submit to the office of town-crier , for the liberty of proclaiming it in the market-place . At length , however , weary of his burden , and resolved to bear it no longer , he consigns it to the custody of the first friend he meets , and returns to his wife with a cheerful aspect , and wonderfully altered for the better .</p>
   <p>Careless is perhaps equally undesigning , though not equally excusable . Entrust him with an affair of the utmost importance , on the concealment of which your fortune and happiness depend , he hears you with a kind of half attention , whistles a favourite air , and accompanies it with the drumming of his fingers upon the table . As soon as your narration is ended , or perhaps in the middle of it , he asks your opinion of his swordknot — condemns his tailor for having dressed him in a snuff-coloured coat instead of a pompadour , and leaves you in haste to attend an auction , where , as if he meant to dispose of his intelligence to the best bidder , he divulges it with a voice as loud as an auctioneer 's ; and , when you tax him with having played you false , he is heartily sorry for it , but never knew that it was to be a secret .</p>
   <p>To these I might add the character of the open and unreserved , who thinks it a breach of friendship to conceal any thing from his intimates ; and the impertinent , who , having by dint of observation made himself master of your secret , imagines he may lawfully publish the knowledge it cost him so much labour to obtain , and considers that privilege as the reward due to his industry . But I shall leave these , with many other characters which my reader 's own experience may suggest to him , and conclude with prescribing , as a short remedy for this evil , that no man may betray the counsel of his friend — let every man keep his own .</p>

   <p>MR . VILLAGE TO MR. TOWN .</p>
   <p>Dear Cousin ,— The country at present , no less than the metropolis , abounding with politicians of every kind , I begin to despair of picking up any intelligence that might possibly be entertaining to your readers . However , I have lately visited some of the most distant parts of the kingdom with a clergyman of my acquaintance : I shall not trouble you with an account of the improvements that have been made in the seats we saw , according to the modern taste , but proceed to give you some reflections which occurred to us in observing several country churches , and the behaviour of their congregations .</p>
   <p>The ruinous condition of some of these edifices gave me great offence ; and I could not help wishing that the honest vicar , instead of indulging his genius for improvements , by enclosing his gooseberry-bushes with a Chinese rail , and converting half an acre of his glebe land into a bowling-green , would have applied part of his income to the more laudable purpose of sheltering his parishioners from the weather during their attendance on divine service . It is no uncommon thing to see the parsonage-house well thatched , and in exceeding good repair , while the church , perhaps , has scarce any other roof than the ivy that grows over it . The noise of owls , bats , and magpies , makes the principal part of the church music in many of these ancient edifices ; and the walls , like a large map , seem to be portioned out into capes , seas , and promontories , by the various colours by which the damps have stained them . Sometimes , the foundation being too weak to support the steeple any longer , it has been found expedient to pull down that part of the building , and to hang the bells under a wooden shed on the ground beside it . This is the case in a parish in Norfolk , through which I lately passed , and where the clerk and the sexton , like the two figures of St. Dunstan 's , serve the bells in the capacity of clappers , by striking them alternately with a hammer .</p>
   <p>In other churches , I have observed that nothing unseemly or ruinous is to be found , except in the clergyman , and the appendages of his person . The ‘ squire of the parish , or his ancestors , perhaps to testify their devotion and leave a lasting monument of their magnificence , have adorned the altar-piece with the richest crimson velvet , embroidered with vine-leaves and ears of wheat ; and have dressed up the pulpit with the same splendour and expense ; while the gentleman who fills it , is exalted in the midst of all this finery , with a surplice as dirty as a farmer 's frock , and a periwig that seems to have transferred its faculty of curling to the band which appears in full buckle beneath it .</p>
   <p>But if I was concerned to see several distressed pastors , as well as many of our country churches in a tottering condition , I was more offended with the indecency of worship in others . I could wish that the clergy would inform their congregations , that there is no occasion to scream themselves hoarse in making their responses ; that the town-crier is not the only person qualified to pray with true devotion ; and that he who bawls the loudest , may nevertheless be the wickedest fellow in the parish . The old women too in the aisle might be told , that their time would be better employed in attending to the sermon , than in fumbling over their tattered Testaments till they have found the text ; by which time the discourse is near drawing to a conclusion : while a word or two of instruction might not be thrown away upon the younger part of the congregation , to teach them that making posies in summer-time , and cracking nuts in autumn , is no part of the religious ceremony .</p>
   <p>The good old practice of psalm-singing is indeed wonderfully improved in many country churches , since the days of Sternhold and Hopkins ; and there is scarce a parish clerk who has so little taste as not to pick his staves out of the new version . This has occasioned great complaints in some places , where the clerk has been forced to bawl by himself , because the rest of the congregation cannot find the psalm at the end of their prayer books ; while others are highly disgusted at the innovation , and stick as obstinately to the old version as to the old style .</p>
   <p>The tunes themselves have also been new set to jiggish measures , and the sober drawl , which used to accompany the two first staves of the hundredth psalm , with the ‘ Gloria Patri , ’ is now split into as many quavers as an Italian air . For this purpose there is in every county an itinerant band of vocal musicians , who make it their business to go round to all the churches in their turns , and , after a prelude with a pitch-pipe , astonish the audience with hymns set to the new Winchester measure , and anthems of their own composing .</p>
   <p>As these new-fashioned psalmodists are necessarily made up of young men and maids , we may naturally suppose that there is a perfect concord and symphony between them ; and , indeed , I have known it happen , that these sweet singers have more than once been brought into disgrace by too close a unison between the thorough-base and the treble .</p>
   <p>It is a difficult matter to decide which is looked upon as the greatest man in a country church , the parson or his clerk . The latter is most certainly held in the higher veneration , where the former happens to be only a poor curate , who rides post every sabbath from village to village , and mounts and dismounts at the church door . The clerk 's office is not only to tag the prayers with an amen , or usher in the sermon with a stave , but he is also the universal father to give away the brides , and the standing god-father to all the new-born bantlings . But in many places there is still a greater man belonging to the church than either the parson or the clerk himself . The person I mean is the ‘ squire ; who , like the king , may be styled the head of the church in his own parish . If the benefice be in his own gift , the vicar is his creature , and of consequence entirely at his devotion : or , if the care of the church be left to a curate , the Sunday fees , roast beef and plum-pudding , and the liberty to shoot in the manor , will bring him as much under the ‘ squire 's command as his dogs and horses .</p>
   <p>For this reason the bell is often kept tolling , and the people waiting in the churchyard an hour longer than the usual time ; nor must the service begin till the ‘ squire has strutted up the aisle and seated himself in the great pew in the chancel . The length of the sermon is also measured by the will of the ‘ squire , as formerly by the hourglass , and I know one parish where the preacher has always the complaisance to conclude his discourse , however abruptly , the minute that the ‘ squire gives the signal by rising up after his nap .</p>
   <p>In a village church , the ‘ squire 's lady , or the vicar 's wife , are perhaps the only females that are stared at for their finery ; but in the large cities and towns , where the newest fashions are brought down weekly by the stage-coach or wagon , all the wives and daughters of the most topping tradesmen vie with each other every Sunday in the elegance of their apparel . I could even trace their gradations in their dress according to the opulence , the extent , and the distance of the place from London . I was at a church in a populous city in the north , where the mace-bearer cleared the way for Mrs. Mayoress , who came sideling after him in an enormous fan-hoop , of a pattern which had never been seen before in those parts . At another church in a corporation town , I saw several Négligées with furbelowed aprons , which had long disputed the prize of superiority ; but these were most wofully eclipsed by a burgess 's daughter just come from London , who appeared in a Trollope or Slammerkin with treble ruffles to the cuffs , pinked and gimped , and the sides of the petticoat drawn up in festoons . In some lesser borough towns , the contest I found lay between three or four black and green bibs and aprons ; at one , a grocer 's wife attracted our eyes by a new-fashioned cap called a Joan , and at another , they were wholly taken up by a mercer 's daughter in a nun 's hood .</p>
   <p>I need not say any thing of the behaviour of the congregation in these more polite places of religious resort ; as the same genteel ceremonies are practised there as at the most fashionable churches in town . The ladies , immediately on their entrance , breathe a pious ejaculation through their fan-sticks , and the beaux very gravely address themselves to the haberdashers ’ bills , glewed upon the lining of their hats . This pious duty is no sooner performed , than the exercise of bowing and courtseying succeeds : the locking and unlocking of the pews drowns the reader 's voice at the beginning of the service ; and the rustling of silks , added to the whispering and tittering of so much good company , renders him totally unintelligible to the very end of it .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>In the comedy of “ The Frenchman in London , ” which , we are told , was acted at Paris with universal applause for several nights together , there is a character of a rough Englishman , who is represented as quite unskilled in the graces of conversation , and his dialogue consists almost entirely of a repetition of the common salutation of — “ How do you do ?— How do you do ? ” Our nation has , indeed , been generally supposed to be of a sullen and uncommunicative disposition ; while , on the other hand , the loquacious French have been allowed to possess the art of conversing beyond all other people . The Englishman requires to be wound up frequently , and stops very soon ; but the Frenchman runs on in a continued alarum . Yet it must be acknowledged , that , as the English consist of very different humours , their manner of discourse admits of great variety ; but the whole French nation converse alike , and there is no difference in their address between a marquis and a valet-de-chambre . We may frequently see a couple of French barbers accosting each other in the street , and paying their compliments with the same volubility of speech , the same grimace and action , as two courtiers in the Tuileries .</p>
   <p>I shall not attempt to lay down any particular rules for conversation , but rather point out such faults in discourse and behaviour as render the company of half mankind rather tedious than amusing . It is in vain , indeed , to look for conversation , where we might expect to find it in the greatest perfection , among persons of fashion ; there it is almost annihilated by universal card-playing ; insomuch that I have heard it given as a reason why it is impossible for our present writers to succeed in the dialogue of genteel comedy , that our people of quality scarce ever meet but to game . All their discourse turns upon the odd trick and the four honours , and it is no less a maxim with the votaries of whist than with those of Bacchus , that talking spoils company .</p>
   <p>Every one endeavours to make himself as agreeable to society as he can ; but it often happens , that those who most aim at shining in conversation overshoot their mark . Though a man succeeds , he should not ( as is frequently the case ) engross the whole talk to himself ; for that destroys the very essence of conversation , which is talking together . We should try to keep up conversation like a ball bandied to and fro from one to another , rather than seize it ourselves , and drive it before us like a football . We should likewise be cautious to adapt the matter of our discourse to our company , and not talk Greek before ladies , or of the last new furbelow to a meeting of country justices .</p>
   <p>But nothing throws a more ridiculous air over our conversations than certain peculiarities , easily acquired , but very difficultly conquered and discarded . In order to display these absurdities in a truer light , it is my present purpose to enumerate such of them as are most commonly to be met with ; and first to take notice of those buffoons in society , the attitudinarians and face-makers . These accompany every word with a peculiar grimace or gesture ; they assent with a shrug , and contradict with a twisting of the neck ; are angry with a wry mouth , and pleased in a caper or a minuet step . They may be considered as speaking harlequins , and their rules of eloquence are taken from the posture-master . These should be condemned to converse only in dumb show with their own person in the looking-glass ; as well as the smirkers and smilers , who so prettily set off their faces , together with their words , by a je-ne-sçai-quoi between a grin and a dimple . With these we may likewise rank the affected tribe of mimics , who are constantly taking off the peculiar tone of voice or gesture of their acquaintance ; though they are such wretched imitators , that ( like bad painters ) they are frequently forced to write the name under the picture , before we can discover any likeness .</p>
   <p>Next to these , whose elocution is absorbed in action , and who converse chiefly with their arms and legs , we may consider the professed speakers . And first , the emphatical ; who squeeze , and press , and ram down every syllable with excessive vehemence and energy . These orators are remarkable for their distinct elocution and force of expression ; they dwell on the important particles of and the , and the significant conjunctive and , which they seem to hawk up with much difficulty out of their own throats , and to cram them with no less pain into the ears of their auditors .</p>
   <p>These should be suffered only to syringe , as it were , the ears of a deaf man , through a hearing-trumpet ; though I must confess , that I am equally offended with whisperers or low speakers , who seem to fancy all their acquaintance deaf , and come up so close to you , that they may be said to measure noses with you , and frequently overcome you with the exhalations of a powerful breath . I would have these oracular gentry obliged to talk at a distance through a speaking-trumpet , or apply their lips to the walls of a whispering-gallery . The wits who will not condescend to utter any thing but a bon-mot , and the whistlers or tune-hummers , who never articulate at all , may be joined very agreeably together in concert ; and to these tinkling cymbals I would also add the sounding brass — the bawler , who inquires after your health with the bellowing of a town-crier .</p>
   <p>The tattlers , whose pliable pipes are admirably adapted to the “ soft parts of conversation , ” and sweetly “ prattling out of fashion , ” make very pretty music from a beautiful face and a female tongue ; but from a rough manly voice and coarse features , mere nonsense is as harsh and dissonant as a jig from a hurdy-gurdy . The swearers I have spoken of in a former paper ; but the half-swearers , who split , and mince , and fritter their oaths into Gad 's but , ad 's fish , and demme , the Gothic humbuggers , and those who “ nick-name God 's creatures , ” and call a man a cabbage , a crab , a queer cub , an odd fish , and an unaccountable muskin , should never come into company without an interpreter . But I will not tire my reader 's patience by pointing out all the pests of conversation ; nor dwell particularly on the sensibles , who pronounce dogmatically on the most trivial points , and speak in sentences ;— the wonderers , who are always wondering what o'clock it is , or wondering whether it will rain or no , or wondering when the moon changes ; the phraseologists , who explain a thing by all that , or enter into particulars with this , that , and t'other ; and lastly , the silent men , who seem afraid of opening their mouths lest they should catch cold , and literally observe the precept of the gospel , by letting their conversation be only yea , yea , and nay , nay .</p>
   <p>The rational intercourse kept up by conversation is one of our principal distinctions from brutes . We should , therefore , endeavour to turn this peculiar talent to our advantage , and consider the organs of speech as the instruments of understanding . We should be very careful not to use them as the weapons of vice , or tools of folly , and do our utmost to unlearn any trivial or ridiculous habits which tend to lessen the value of such an inestimable prerogative . It is indeed imagined by some philosophers , that even birds and beasts ( though without the power of articulation ) perfectly understand one another by the sounds they utter ; and that dogs and cats , &amp; c ., have each a particular language to themselves , like different nations . Thus it may be supposed that the nightingales of Italy have as fine an ear for their own native wood notes , as any signor or signora for an Italian air ; that the boars of Westphalia gruntle as expressively through the nose as the inhabitants in High German ; and that the frogs in the dykes of Holland croak as intelligibly as the natives jabber their Low Dutch . However this may be , we may consider those whose tongues hardly seem to be under the influence of reason , and do not keep up the proper conversation of human creatures , as imitating the language of different animals : thus , for instance , the affinity between chatterers and monkeys , and praters and parrots , is too obvious not to occur at once : grunters and growlers may be justly compared to hogs ; snarlers are curs ; and the spitfire passionate are a sort of wild cats , that will not bear stroking , but will pur when they are pleased . Complainers are screech-owls ; and story-tellers , always repeating the same dull note , are cuckoos . Poets that prick up their ears at their own hideous braying are no better than asses ; critics in general are venomous serpents that delight in hissing ; and some of them , who have got by heart a few technical terms , without knowing their meaning , are no other than magpies . I myself , who have crowed to the whole town for near three years past , may perhaps put my readers in mind of a dunghill cock ; but as I must acquaint them that they will hear the last of me on this day fortnight , I hope they will then consider me as a swan , who is supposed to sing sweetly in his dying moments .</p>
