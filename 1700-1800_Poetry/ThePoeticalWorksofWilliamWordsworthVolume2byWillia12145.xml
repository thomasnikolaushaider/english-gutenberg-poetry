     <p>WORDSWORTH 'S POETICAL WORKS PETER BELL : A TALE [ A ]</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>Composed<date>1798</date>. [ B ] — Published<date>1819</date>. ‘ What 's in a Name ? ’ [ C ] ‘ Brutus will start a Spirit as soon as Cæsar ! ’ [ D ] To ROBERT SOUTHEY , ESQ ., P. L ., ETC ., ETC . MY DEAR FRIEND — The Tale of ‘ Peter Bell ’ , which I now introduce to your notice , and to that of the Public , has , in its Manuscript state , nearly survived its minority :— for it first saw the light in the summer of<date>1798</date>. During this long interval , pains have been taken at different times to make the production less unworthy of a favourable reception ; or , rather , to fit it for filling permanently a station , however humble , in the Literature of our Country . This has , indeed , been the aim of all my endeavours in Poetry , which , you know , have been sufficiently laborious to prove that I deem the Art not lightly to be approached ; and that the attainment of excellence in it , may laudably be made the principal object of intellectual pursuit by any man , who , with reasonable consideration of circumstances , has faith in his own impulses . The Poem of ‘ Peter Bell ’ , as the Prologue will show , was composed under a belief that the Imagination not only does not require for its exercise the intervention of supernatural agency , but that , though such agency be excluded , the faculty may be called forth as imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure , by incidents , within the compass of poetic probability , in the humblest departments of daily life . Since that Prologue was written , you have exhibited most splendid effects of judicious daring , in the opposite and usual course . Let this acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the supernatural ; and I am persuaded it will be admitted , that to you , as a Master in that province of the art , the following Tale , whether from contrast or congruity , is not an unappropriate offering . Accept it , then , as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with whose name yours has been often coupled ( to use your own words ) for evil and for good ; and believe me to be , with earnest wishes that life and health may be granted you to complete the many important works in which you are engaged , and with high respect , Most faithfully yours ,</docImprint>

    <docImprint>RYDAL MOUNT , April 7 ,<date>1819</date>. [ Written at Alfoxden . Founded upon an anecdote which I read in a newspaper , of an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a wretched posture . Upon examination a dead body was found in the water , and proved to be the body of its master . The countenance , gait , and figure of Peter were taken from a wild rover with whom I walked from Builth , on the river Wye , downwards , nearly as far as the town of Hay . He told me strange stories . It has always been a pleasure to me through life , to catch at every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of becoming acquainted with this class of people . The number of Peter 's wives was taken from the trespasses , in this way , of a lawless creature , who lived in the county of Durham , and used to be attended by many women , sometimes not less than half a dozen , as disorderly as himself , and a story went in the country that he had been heard to say , while they were quarrelling , “ Why can n't ye be quiet , there 's none so many of you ? ” Benoni , or the child of sorrow , I knew when I was a schoolboy . His mother had been deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood , she herself being a gentlewoman by birth . The circumstances of her story were told me by my dear old dame , Ann Tyson , who was her confidante . The lady died broken-hearted . In the woods of Alfoxden I used to take great delight in noticing the habits , tricks , and physiognomy of asses ; and I have no doubt that I was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking for the creature that is often so dreadfully abused . The crescent moon , which makes such a figure in the prologue , assumed this character one evening while I was watching its beauty in front of Alfoxden House . I intended this poem for the volume before spoken of , but it was not published for more than twenty years afterwards . The worship of the Methodists , or Ranters , is often heard during the stillness of the summer evening , in the country , with affecting accompaniments of rural beauty . In both the psalmody and voice of the preacher there is , not unfrequently , much solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the rudest characters under favourable circumstances .— I . F .] Classed by Wordsworth among his “ Poems of the Imagination . ” — ED . PROLOGUE There 's something in a flying horse , There 's something<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>in a huge balloon ; But through the clouds I 'll never float Until I have a little Boat , Shaped like<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>the crescent-moon . 5 And now I have a little Boat , In shape a very crescent-moon : Fast through the clouds my boat can sail ; But if perchance your faith should fail , Look up — and you shall see me soon ! 10 The woods , my Friends , are round you roaring , Rocking and roaring like a sea ; The noise of danger 's in<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>your ears , And ye have all a thousand fears Both for my little Boat and me ! 15 Meanwhile untroubled I admire<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The pointed horns of my canoe ; And , did not pity touch my breast , To see how ye are all distrest , Till my ribs ached , I 'd laugh at you ! 20 Away we go , my Boat and I — Frail man ne'er sate in such another ; Whether among the winds we strive , Or deep into the clouds<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>we dive , Each is contented with the other . 25 Away we go — and what care we For treasons , tumults , and for wars ? We are as calm in our delight As is the crescent-moon so bright Among the scattered stars . 30 Up goes my Boat among<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>the stars Through many a breathless field of light , Through many a long blue field of ether , Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her : Up goes my little Boat so bright ! 35 The Crab , the Scorpion , and the Bull — We pry among them all ; have shot High o'er the red-haired race of Mars , Covered from top to toe with scars ; Such company I like it not ! 40 The towns in Saturn are decayed , And melancholy Spectres throng them ;—<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>The Pleiads , that appear to kiss Each other in the vast abyss , With joy I sail among<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>them , 45 Swift Mercury resounds with mirth , Great Jove is full of stately bowers ; But these , and all that they contain , What are they to that tiny grain , That little Earth<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>of ours ? 50 Then back to Earth , the dear green Earth :— Whole ages if I here should roam , The world for my remarks and me Would not a whit the better be ; I 've left my heart at home . 55 See ! there she is ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>the matchless Earth ! There spreads the famed Pacific Ocean ! Old Andes thrusts yon craggy spear Through the grey clouds ; the Alps are here , Like waters in commotion ! 60 Yon tawny slip is Libya 's sands That silver thread the river Dnieper ; And look , where clothed in brightest green Is a sweet Isle , of isles the Queen ; Ye fairies , from all evil keep her ! 65 And see the town where I was born ! Around those happy fields we span In boyish gambols ;— I was lost Where I have been , but on this coast I feel I am a man . 70 Never did fifty things at once Appear so lovely , never , never ;— How tunefully the forests ring ! To hear the earth 's soft murmuring Thus could I hang for ever ! 75 “ Shame on you ! ” cried my little Boat , “ Was ever such a homesick<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>Loon , Within a living Boat to sit , And make no better use of it ; A Boat twin-sister of the crescent-moon ! 80<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></docImprint>

     <p>“ Ne'er in the breast of full-grown Poet Fluttered so faint a heart before ;— Was it the music of the spheres That overpowered your mortal ears ? — Such din shall trouble them no more . 85 “ These nether precincts do not lack Charms of their own ;— then come with me ; I want a comrade , and for you There 's nothing that I would not do ; Nought is there that you shall not see . 90 “ Haste ! and above Siberian snows We 'll sport amid the boreal morning ; Will mingle with her lustres gliding Among the stars , the stars now hiding , And now the stars adorning . 95 “ I know the secrets of a land Where human foot did never stray ; Fair is that land<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>as evening skies , And cool , though in the depth it lies Of burning Africa . 100 “ Or we 'll into the realm of Faery , Among the lovely shades of things ; The shadowy forms of mountains bare , And streams , and bowers , and ladies fair , The shades of palaces and kings ! 105 “ Or , if you thirst with hardy zeal Less quiet regions to explore , Prompt voyage shall to you reveal How earth and heaven are taught to feel The might of magic lore ! ” 110 “ My little vagrant Form of light , My gay and beautiful Canoe , Well have you played your friendly part ; As kindly take what from my heart Experience forces — then adieu ! 115 “ Temptation lurks among your words ; But , while these pleasures you 're pursuing Without impediment or let , No wonder if you quite forget<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>What on the earth is doing . 120 “ There was a time when all mankind Did listen with a faith sincere To tuneful tongues in mystery versed ; Then Poets fearlessly rehearsed The wonders of a wild career . 125 “ Go — ( but the world 's a sleepy world , And ‘ tis , I fear , an age too late ) Take with you some ambitious Youth ! For , restless Wanderer ! I , in truth ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Am all unfit to be your mate . 130 “ Long have I loved what I behold , The night that calms , the day that cheers ; The common growth of mother-earth Suffices me — her tears , her mirth , Her humblest mirth and tears . 135 “ The dragon 's wing , the magic ring , I shall not covet for my dower , If I along that lowly way With sympathetic heart may stray , And with a soul of power . 140 “ These given , what more need I desire To stir , to soothe , or elevate ? What nobler marvels than the mind May in life 's daily prospect find , May find or there create ? 145 “ A potent wand doth Sorrow wield ; What spell so strong as guilty Fear ! Repentance is a tender Sprite ; If aught on earth have heavenly might , ‘ Tis lodged within her silent tear . 150 “ But grant my wishes ,— let us now Descend from this ethereal height ; Then take thy way , adventurous Skiff , More daring far than Hippogriff , And be thy own delight ! 155 “ To the stone-table in my garden , Loved haunt of many a summer hour , [ E ] The Squire is come : his daughter Bess Beside him in the cool recess Sits blooming like a flower . 160 “ With these are many more convened ; They know not I have been so far ;— I see them there , in number nine , Beneath the spreading Weymouth-pine ! I see them — there they are ! 165 “ There sits the Vicar and his Dame ; And there my good friend , Stephen Otter ; And , ere the light of evening fail , To them I must relate the Tale Of Peter Bell the Potter . ” 170 Off flew the Boat — away she flees , Spurning her freight with indignation !<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>“ And I , as well as I was able , On two poor legs , toward my stone-table Limped on with sore vexation .<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>175 “ O , here he is ! ” cried little Bess — She saw me at the garden-door ; “ We 've waited anxiously and long , ” They cried , and all around me throng , Full nine of them or more ! 180 “ Reproach me not — your fears be still — Be thankful we again have met ;— Resume , my Friends ! within the shade Your seats , and quickly<span type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>shall be paid The well-remembered debt . ” 185 I spake with faltering voice , like one Not wholly rescued from the pale Of a wild dream , or worse illusion ; But , straight , to cover my confusion , Began the promised Tale .<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>190 PART FIRST All by the moonlight river side Groaned the poor Beast — alas ! in vain ; The staff was raised to loftier height , And the blows fell with heavier weight As Peter struck — and struck again .<span type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>195<span type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>“ Hold ! ” cried the Squire , “ against the rules Of common sense you 're surely sinning ; This leap is for us all too bold ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>Who Peter was , let that be told , And start from the beginning . ” 200 — “ A Potter , [ F ] Sir , he was by trade , ” Said I , becoming quite collected ; “ And wheresoever he appeared , Full twenty times was Peter feared For once that Peter was respected . 205 “ He two-and-thirty years or more , Had been a wild and woodland rover ; Had heard the Atlantic surges roar On farthest Cornwall 's rocky shore , And trod the cliffs of Dover . 210 “ And he had seen Caernarvon 's towers , And well he knew the spire of Sarum ; And he had been where Lincoln bell Flings o'er the fen that ponderous knell — A far-renowned alarum .<span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>215 “ At Doncaster , at York , and Leeds , And merry Carlisle had he been ; And all along the Lowlands fair , All through the bonny shire of Ayr ; And far as Aberdeen . 220 “ And he had been at Inverness ; And Peter , by the mountain-rills , Had danced his round with Highland lasses ; And he had lain beside his asses On lofty Cheviot Hills : 225 “ And he had trudged through Yorkshire dales , Among the rocks and winding scars ; Where deep and low the hamlets lie Beneath their little patch of sky And little lot of stars : 230 “ And all along the indented coast , Bespattered with the salt-sea foam ; Where'er a knot of houses lay On headland , or in hollow bay ;— Sure never man like him did roam ! 235 “ As well might Peter , in the Fleet , Have been fast bound , a begging debtor ;— He travelled here , he travelled there ;— But not the value of a hair Was heart or head the better . 240 “ He roved among the vales and streams , In the green wood and hollow dell ; They were his dwellings night and day ,— But nature ne'er could find the way Into the heart of Peter Bell . 245 “ In vain , through every changeful year , Did Nature lead him as before ; A primrose by a river 's brim A yellow primrose was to him , And it was nothing more . 250 “ Small change it made in Peter 's heart To see his gentle panniered train With more than vernal pleasure feeding , Where'er the tender grass was leading Its earliest green along the lane . 255 “ In vain , through water , earth , and air , The soul of happy sound was spread , When Peter on some April morn , Beneath the broom or budding thorn , Made the warm earth his lazy bed . 260 “ At noon , when , by the forest 's edge He lay beneath the branches high , The soft blue sky did never melt Into his heart ; he never felt The witchery of the soft blue sky ! 265 “ On a fair prospect some have looked And felt , as I have heard them say , As if the moving time had been A thing as steadfast as the scene On which they gazed themselves away . 270 “ Within the breast of Peter Bell These silent raptures found no place ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 24 ]</span>He was a Carl as wild and rude As ever hue-and-cry pursued , As ever ran a felon 's race . 275 “ Of all that lead a lawless life , Of all that love their lawless lives , In city or in village small , He was the wildest far of all ;— He had a dozen wedded wives . 280 “ Nay , start not !— wedded wives — and twelve ! But how one wife could e'er come near him , In simple truth I cannot tell ; For , be it said of Peter Bell , To see him was to fear him . 285 “ Though Nature could not touch his heart By lovely forms , and silent<span type="note_anchor">[ 25 ]</span>weather , And tender sounds , yet you might see At once , that Peter Bell and she Had often been together . 290 “ A savage wildness round him hung As of a dweller out of doors ; In his whole figure and his mien A savage character was seen Of mountains and of dreary moors . 295 “ To all the unshaped half-human thoughts Which solitary Nature feeds ‘ Mid summer storms or winter 's ice , Had Peter joined whatever vice The cruel city breeds . 300 “ His face was keen as is the wind That cuts along the hawthorn-fence ; Of courage you saw little there , But , in its stead , a medley air Of cunning and of impudence . 305 “ He had a dark and sidelong walk , And long and slouching was his gait ; Beneath his looks so bare and bold , You might perceive , his spirit cold Was playing with some inward bait . 310 “ His forehead wrinkled was and furred ; A work , one half of which was done By thinking of his ‘ whens , ’ and ‘ hows ’ ; And half , by knitting of his brows Beneath the glaring sun . 315 “ There was a hardness in his cheek , There was a hardness in his eye , As if the man had fixed his face , In many a solitary place , Against the wind and open sky ! ” 320 One night , ( and now my little Bess ! We 've reached at last the promised Tale ;) One beautiful November night , When the full moon was shining bright Upon the rapid river Swale , 325 Along the river 's winding banks Peter was travelling all alone ; Whether to buy or sell , or led By pleasure running in his head , To me was never known . 330 He trudged along through copse and brake , He trudged along o'er hill and dale ; Nor for the moon cared he a tittle , And for the stars he cared as little , And for the murmuring river Swale . 335 But , chancing to espy a path That promised to cut short the way ; As many a wiser man hath done , He left a trusty guide for one That might his steps betray . 340 To a thick wood he soon is brought Where cheerily<span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>his course he weaves , And whistling loud may yet be heard , Though often buried , like a bird Darkling , among the boughs and leaves . 345 But quickly Peter 's mood is changed , And on he drives with cheeks that burn In downright fury and in wrath ;— There 's little sign the treacherous path Will to the road return ! 350 The path grows dim , and dimmer still ; Now up , now down , the Rover wends , With all the sail that he can carry , Till brought to a deserted quarry —<span type="note_anchor">[ 27 ]</span>And there the pathway ends . 355<span type="note_anchor">[ 28 ]</span></p>

    <docImprint>He paused — for shadows of strange shape , Massy and black , before him lay ; But through the dark , and through the cold ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 29 ]</span>And through the yawning fissures old , Did Peter boldly press his way 360 Right through the quarry ;— and behold A scene of soft and lovely hue !

     <p>Thought Peter , What can mean all this ? Some ugly witchcraft must be here ! — Once more the Ass , with motion dull , Upon the pivot of his skull Turned round his long left ear . 420 Suspicion ripened into dread ; Yet with deliberate action slow , His staff high-raising , in the pride Of skill , upon the sounding hide ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>He dealt a sturdy blow . 425 The poor Ass staggered with the shock ; And then , as if to take his ease ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 40 ]</span>In quiet uncomplaining mood , Upon the spot where he had stood , Dropped gently down upon his knees ; 430 As gently on<span type="note_anchor">[ 41 ]</span>his side he fell ; And by the river 's brink did lie ; And , while<span type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>he lay like one that mourned , The patient Beast on Peter turned His shining hazel eye .<span type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>435 ‘ Twas but one mild , reproachful look , A look more tender than severe ; And straight in sorrow , not in dread , He turned the eye-ball in his head Towards the smooth river<span type="note_anchor">[ 44 ]</span>deep and clear . 440 Upon the Beast the sapling rings ; His lank sides heaved ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>his limbs they stirred ; He gave a groan , and then another , Of that which went before the brother , And then he gave a third . 445 All by the moonlight river side He gave three miserable groans ; And not till now hath Peter seen How gaunt the Creature is ,— how lean And sharp his staring bones !<span type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span>450 With legs stretched out and stiff he lay :— No word of kind commiseration Fell at the sight from Peter 's tongue ; With hard contempt his heart was wrung , With hatred and vexation . 455 The meagre beast lay still as death ; And Peter 's lips with fury quiver ; Quoth he , “ You little mulish dog , I 'll fling your carcass like a log Head-foremost down the river ! ” 460 An impious oath confirmed the threat — Whereat from the earth on which he lay<span type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span>To all the echoes , south and north , And east and west , the Ass sent forth A long and clamorous bray !<span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>465 This outcry , on the heart of Peter , Seems like a note of joy to strike ,— Joy at<span type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span>the heart of Peter knocks ; But in the echo of the rocks Was something Peter did not like . 470 Whether to cheer his coward breast , Or that he could not break the chain , In this serene and solemn hour , Twined round him by demoniac power , To the blind work he turned again . 475 Among the rocks and winding crags ; Among the mountains far away ; Once more the Ass did lengthen out More ruefully a deep-drawn shout , The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray !<span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>480 What is there now in Peter 's heart ! Or whence the might of this strange sound ? The moon uneasy looked and dimmer , The broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer , And the rocks staggered all around — 485 From Peter 's hand the sapling dropped ! Threat has he none to execute ; “ If any one should come and see That I am here , they 'll think , ” quoth he , “ I 'm helping this poor dying brute . ” 490 He scans the Ass from limb to limb , And ventures now to uplift his eyes ; More steady looks the moon , and clear , More like themselves the rocks appear And touch more quiet skies .<span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>495 His scorn returns — his hate revives ; He stoops the Ass 's neck to seize With malice — that again takes flight ; For in the pool a startling sight Meets him , among the inverted trees .<span type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span>500 Is it the moon 's distorted face ?

Such as pursue their feared vagaries<span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>In sylvan bower , or haunted hall ? 510 Is it a fiend that to a stake Of fire his desperate self is tethering ?

So toward the stream his head he bent , And downward thrust his staff , intent The river 's depth to sound .<span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span>555 Now — like a tempest-shattered bark , That overwhelmed and prostrate lies , And in a moment to the verge Is lifted of a foaming surge — Full suddenly the Ass doth rise ! 560 His staring bones all shake with joy , And close by Peter 's side he stands : While Peter o'er the river bends , The little Ass his neck extends , And fondly licks his hands . 565 Such life is in the Ass 's eyes , Such life is in his limbs and ears ; That Peter Bell , if he had been The veriest coward ever seen , Must now have thrown aside his fears . 570 The Ass looks on — and to his work Is Peter quietly resigned ; He touches here — he touches there — And now among the dead man 's hair His sapling Peter has entwined . 575 He pulls — and looks — and pulls again ; And he whom the poor Ass had lost , The man who had been four days dead , Head-foremost from the river 's bed Uprises like a ghost ! [ G ] 580 And Peter draws him to dry land ; And through the brain of Peter pass Some poignant twitches , fast and faster ; “ No doubt , ” quoth he , “ he is the Master Of this poor miserable Ass ! ” 585 The meagre shadow that looks on — What would he now ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>what is he doing ?

And Peter honestly might say , The like came never to his ears , Though he has been , full thirty years , A rover — night and day ! 615 ‘ Tis not a plover of the moors , ‘ Tis not a bittern of the fen ; Nor can it be a barking fox , Nor night-bird chambered in the rocks , Nor wild-cat in a woody glen ! 620 The Ass is startled — and stops short Right in the middle of the thicket ; And Peter , wont to whistle loud Whether alone or in a crowd , Is silent as a silent cricket . 625 What ails you now , my little Bess ? Well may you tremble and look grave ! This cry — that rings along the wood , This cry — that floats adown the flood , Comes from the entrance of a cave : 630 I see a blooming Wood-boy there , And if I had the power to say How sorrowful the wanderer is , Your heart would be as sad as his Till you had kissed his tears away ! 635 Grasping<span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>a hawthorn branch in hand , All bright with berries ripe and red , Into the cavern 's mouth he peeps ; Thence back into the moonlight creeps ; Whom seeks he — whom ?— the silent dead :<span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>640 His father !— Him doth he require — Him hath he sought<span type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span>with fruitless pains , Among the rocks , behind the trees ; Now creeping on his hands and knees , Now running o'er the open plains . 645 And hither is he come at last , When he through such a day has gone , By this dark cave to be distrest Like a poor bird — her plundered nest Hovering around with dolorous moan ! 650 Of that intense and piercing cry The listening Ass conjectures well ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span>Wild as it is , he there can read Some intermingled notes that plead With touches irresistible . 655 But Peter — when he saw the Ass Not only stop but turn , and change The cherished tenor of his pace That lamentable cry<span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>to chase — It wrought in him conviction strange ; 660 A faith that , for the dead man 's sake And this poor slave who loved him well , Vengeance upon his head will fall , Some visitation worse than all Which ever till this night befel . 665 Meanwhile the Ass to reach his home ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span>Is striving stoutly as he may ; But , while he climbs the woody hill , The cry grows weak — and weaker still ; And now at last it dies away . 670 So with his freight the Creature turns Into a gloomy grove of beech , Along the shade with footsteps<span type="note_anchor">[ 73 ]</span>true Descending slowly , till the two The open moonlight reach . 675 And there , along the<span type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>narrow dell , A fair smooth pathway you discern , A length of green and open road — As if it from a fountain flowed — Winding away between the fern . 680 The rocks that tower on either side Build up a wild fantastic scene ; Temples like those among the Hindoos , And mosques , and spires , and abbey-windows , And castles all with ivy green ! 685 And , while the Ass pursues his way , Along this solitary dell , As pensively his steps advance , The mosques and spires change countenance , And look at Peter Bell ! 690 That unintelligible cry Hath left him high in preparation ,— Convinced that he , or soon or late , This very night will meet his fate — And so he sits in expectation ! 695<span type="note_anchor">[ 75 ]</span>The strenuous Animal hath clomb With the green path ; and now he wends Where , shining like the smoothest sea , In undisturbed immensity A<span type="note_anchor">[ 76 ]</span>level plain extends . 700 But whence this faintly-rustling sound By which the journeying pair are chased ? — A withered leaf is close behind ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 77 ]</span>Light plaything for the sportive wind Upon that solitary waste . 705 When Peter spied the moving thing , It only doubled his distress ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 78 ]</span>“ Where there is not a bush or tree , The very leaves they follow me — So huge hath been my wickedness ! ” 710 To a close lane they now are come , Where , as before , the enduring Ass Moves on without a moment 's stop , Nor once turns round his head to crop A bramble-leaf or blade of grass . 715 Between the hedges as they go , The white dust sleeps upon the lane ; And Peter , ever and anon Back-looking , sees , upon a stone , Or in the dust , a crimson stain . 720 A stain — as of a drop of blood By moonlight made more faint and wan ; Ha ! why these sinkings of despair ?<span type="note_anchor">[ 79 ]</span>He knows not how the blood comes there — And Peter is a wicked man . 725 At length he spies a bleeding wound , Where he had struck the Ass 's head ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 80 ]</span>He sees the blood , knows what it is ,— A glimpse of sudden joy was his , But then it quickly fled ; 730 Of him whom sudden death had seized He thought ,— of thee , O faithful Ass !

Kind Listeners , that around me sit , I feel that I am all unfit For such high argument . 790 I 've played , I 've danced ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>with my narration ; I loitered long ere I began : Ye waited then on my good pleasure ; Pour out indulgence still , in measure As liberal as ye can ! 795 Our Travellers , ye remember well , Are thridding a sequestered lane ; And Peter many tricks is trying , And many anodynes applying , To ease his conscience of its pain . 800 By this his heart is lighter far ; And , finding that he can account So snugly<span type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span>for that crimson stain , His evil spirit up again Does like an empty bucket mount . 805 And Peter is a deep logician Who hath no lack of wit mercurial ; “ Blood drops — leaves rustle — yet , ” quoth he , “ This poor man never , but for me , Could have had Christian burial . 810 “ And , say the best you can , ‘ tis plain , That here has<span type="note_anchor">[ 91 ]</span>been some wicked dealing ; No doubt the devil in me wrought ; I 'm not the man who could have thought An Ass like this was worth the stealing ! ” 815 So from his pocket Peter takes His shining horn tobacco-box ; And , in a light and careless way , As men who with their purpose play , Upon the lid he knocks . 820 Let them whose voice can stop the clouds , Whose cunning eye can see the wind , Tell to a curious world the cause Why , making here a sudden pause , The Ass turned round his head , and grinned . 825 Appalling process ! I have marked The like on heath , in lonely wood ; And , verily , have seldom met A spectacle more hideous — yet It suited Peter 's present mood . 830 And , grinning in his turn , his teeth He in jocose defiance showed — When , to upset<span type="note_anchor">[ 92 ]</span>his spiteful mirth , A murmur , pent within the earth , In the dead earth beneath the road , 835 Rolled audibly ! it swept along , A muffled noise — a rumbling sound !— ‘ Twas by a troop of miners made , Plying with gunpowder their trade , Some twenty fathoms underground . 840 Small cause of dire effect ! for , surely , If ever mortal , King or Cotter , Believed that earth was charged to quake And yawn for his unworthy sake , ‘ Twas Peter Bell the Potter . 845 But , as an oak in breathless air Will stand though to the centre hewn ; Or as the weakest things , if frost Have stiffened them , maintain their post ; So he , beneath the gazing moon !— 850 The Beast bestriding thus , he reached A spot where , in a sheltering cove ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>A little chapel stands alone , With greenest ivy overgrown , And tufted with an ivy grove ; 855 Dying insensibly away From human thoughts and purposes , It seemed — wall , window , roof and tower<span type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span>— To bow to some transforming power , And blend with the surrounding trees . 860 As ruinous a place it was , Thought Peter , in the shire of Fife That served my turn , when following still From land to land a reckless will<span type="note_anchor">[ 95 ]</span>I married my sixth wife ! 865 The unheeding Ass moves slowly on , And now is passing by an inn Brim-full of a carousing crew , That make ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 96 ]</span>with curses not a few , An uproar and a drunken din . 870 I cannot well express the thoughts Which Peter in those noises found ;— A stifling power compressed his frame , While-as a swimming darkness came<span type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span>Over that dull and dreary sound . 875 For well did Peter know the sound ; The language of those drunken joys To him , a jovial soul , I ween , But a few hours ago , had been A gladsome and a welcome noise . 880 Now ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span>turned adrift into the past , He finds no solace in his course ; Like planet-stricken men of yore , He trembles , smitten to the core By strong compunction and remorse . 885 But , more than all , his heart is stung To think of one , almost a child ; A sweet and playful Highland girl , As light and beauteous as a squirrel , As beauteous and as wild ! 890 Her dwelling was a lonely house ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 99 ]</span>A cottage in a heathy dell ; And she put on her gown of green , And left her mother at sixteen , And followed Peter Bell . 895 But many good and pious thoughts Had she ; and , in the kirk to pray , Two long Scotch miles , through rain or snow , To kirk she had been used to go , Twice every Sabbath-day . 900 And , when she followed Peter Bell , It was to lead an honest life ; For he , with tongue not used to falter , Had pledged his troth before the altar To love her as his wedded wife . 905 A mother 's hope is hers ;— but soon She drooped and pined like one forlorn ; From Scripture she a name<span type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>did borrow ; Benoni , or the child of sorrow , She called her babe unborn . 910 For she had learned how Peter lived , And took it in most grievous part ; She to the very bone was worn , And , ere that little child was born , Died of a broken heart . 915 And now the Spirits of the Mind Are busy with poor Peter Bell ; Upon the rights of visual sense Usurping , with a prevalence More terrible than magic spell .<span type="note_anchor">[ 101 ]</span>920 Close by a brake of flowering furze ( Above it shivering aspens play ) He sees an unsubstantial creature , His very self in form and feature , Not four yards from the broad highway : 925 And stretched beneath the furze he sees The Highland girl — it is no other ; And hears her crying as she cried , The very moment that she died , “ My mother ! oh my mother ! ” 930 The sweat pours down from Peter 's face , So grievous is his heart 's contrition ; With agony his eye-balls ache While he beholds by the furze-brake This miserable vision ! 935 Calm is the well-deserving brute , His peace hath no offence betrayed ; But now , while down that slope he wends , A voice to Peter 's ear<span type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span>ascends , Resounding from the woody glade : 940 The voice , though clamorous as a horn Re-echoed by a naked rock , Comes from that tabernacle — List !<span type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span>Within , a fervent<span type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span>Methodist Is preaching to no heedless flock ! 945 “ Repent ! repent ! ” he cries aloud , “ While yet ye may find mercy ;— strive To love the Lord with all your might ; Turn to him , seek him day and night , And save your souls alive ! 950 “ Repent ! repent ! though ye have gone , Through paths of wickedness and woe , After the Babylonian harlot ; And , though your sins be red as scarlet , They shall be white as snow ! ” 955 Even as he passed the door , these words Did plainly come to Peter 's ears ; And they such joyful tidings were , The joy was more than he could bear !— He melted into tears . 960 Sweet tears of hope and tenderness ! And fast they fell , a plenteous shower ! His nerves , his sinews seemed to melt ; Through all his iron frame was felt A gentle , a relaxing , power ! 965 Each fibre of his frame was weak ; Weak all the animal within ; But , in its helplessness , grew mild And gentle as an infant child , An infant that has known no sin . 970 ‘ Tis said , meek Beast ! that , through Heaven 's grace ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span>[ H ] He not unmoved did notice now The cross [ I ] upon thy shoulder scored , For lasting impress , by the Lord<span type="note_anchor">[ 106 ]</span>To whom all human-kind shall bow ; 975 Memorial of his touch — that day<span type="note_anchor">[ 107 ]</span>When Jesus humbly deigned to ride , Entering the proud Jerusalem , By an immeasurable stream [ J ] Of shouting people deified ! 980 Meanwhile the persevering Ass , Turned towards a gate that hung in view Across a shady lane ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 108 ]</span>his chest Against the yielding gate he pressed And quietly passed through . 985 And up the stony lane he goes ; No ghost more softly ever trod ; Among the stones and pebbles , he Sets down his hoofs inaudibly , As if with felt his hoofs were shod . 990 Along the lane the trusty Ass Went twice two hundred yards or more , And no one could have guessed his aim ,— Till to a lonely house he came , And stopped beside the door .<span type="note_anchor">[ 109 ]</span>995</p>

     <p>“ Oh ! God be praised — my heart 's at ease — For he is dead — I know it well ! ” — At this she wept a bitter flood ; And , in the best way that he could , His tale did Peter tell . 1030</p>

Into the same picture Haydon “ introduced Wordsworth bowing in reverence and awe . ” See the essay on “ The Portraits of Wordsworth ” in a later volume , and the portrait itself , which will be reproduced in the volume containing the ‘ Life ’ of the poet .— Ed . ] [ Footnote K : The first and second editions of ‘ Peter Bell ’ (<date>1819</date>) contained , as frontispiece , an engraving by J. C. Bromley , after a picture by Sir George Beaumont . In<date>1807</date>, Wordsworth wrote to Sir George : “ I am quite delighted to hear of your picture for ‘ Peter Bell ’ .... But remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular , and I am afraid that the sale of ‘ Peter ’ would not carry the expense of engraving .... The people would love the poem of ‘ Peter Bell ’ , but the public ( a very different thing ) will never love it . ” Some days before Wordsworth 's ‘ Peter Bell ’ was issued in<date>1819</date>, another ‘ Peter Bell ’ was published by Messrs. Taylor and Hessey . It was a parody written by J. Hamilton Reynolds , and issued as ‘ Peter Bell , a Lyrical Ballad ’ , with the sentence on its title page , “ I do affirm that I am the real Simon Pure . ” The preface , which follows , is too paltry to quote ; and the stanzas which make up the poem contain allusions to the more trivial of the early “ Lyrical Ballads ” ( Betty Foy , Harry Gill , etc . ) . Wordsworth 's ‘ Peter Bell ’ was published about a week later ; and Shelley afterwards published his ‘ Peter Bell the Third ’ . Charles Lamb wrote to Wordsworth , in May<date>1819</date>: “ Dear Wordsworth — I received a copy of ‘ Peter Bell ’ a week ago , and I hope the author will not be offended if I say I do not much relish it . The humour , if it is meant for humour , is forced ; and then the price !— sixpence would have been dear for it . Mind , I do not mean your ‘ Peter Bell ’ , but a Peter Bell , which preceded it about a week , and is in every bookseller 's shop window in<settlement>London</settlement>, the type and paper nothing differing from the true one , the preface signed W. W ., and the supplementary preface quoting , as the author 's words , an extract from the supplementary preface to the ‘ Lyrical Ballads . ’ Is there no law against these rascals ? I would have this Lambert Simnel whipt at the cart 's tail . ” ( ‘ The Letters of Charles Lamb ’ , edited by A.

    <docImprint>[ Sub-Footnote a : This stanza , which was deleted from every edition of ‘ Peter Bell ’ after the two of<date>1819</date>, was prefixed by Shelley to his poem of ‘ Peter Bell the Third ’ , and many of his contemporaries thought that it was an invention of Shelley 's . See the note which follows this poem , p. 50 . Crabb Robinson wrote in his ‘ Diary ’ , June 6 ,<date>1812</date>: “ Mrs . Basil Montagu told me she had no doubt she had suggested this image to Wordsworth by relating to him an anecdote . A person , walking in a friend 's garden , looking in at a window , saw a company of ladies at a table near the window , with countenances fixed . In an instant he was aware of their condition , and broke the window . He saved them from incipient suffocation . ” Wordsworth subsequently said that he had omitted the stanza only in deference to the “ unco guid . ” Crabb Robinson remonstrated with him against its exclusion .— Ed . ] LINES , [ A ] COMPOSED A FEW MILES ABOVE TINTERN ABBEY , ON REVISITING THE BANKS OF THE WYE DURING A TOUR , JULY 13 ,<date>1798</date>[ B ] Composed July<date>1798</date>.— Published<date>1798</date>[ July<date>1798</date>. No poem of mine was composed under circumstances more pleasant for me to remember than this . I began it upon leaving Tintern , after crossing the Wye , and concluded it just as I was entering Bristol in the evening , after a ramble of four or five days , with my sister . Not a line of it was altered , and not any part of it written down till I reached Bristol . It was published almost immediately after in the little volume of which so much has been said in these Notes , the “ Lyrical Ballads , ” as first published at Bristol by Cottle .— I.

[ D ] — Once again Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs , 5 That<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>on a wild secluded scene impress Thoughts of more deep seclusion ; and connect The landscape with the quiet of the sky . The day is come when I again repose Here , under this dark sycamore , and view 10 These plots of cottage-ground , these orchard-tufts , Which at this season , with their unripe fruits , Are clad in one green hue , and lose themselves ‘ Mid groves and copses .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Once again I see These hedge-rows , hardly hedge-rows , little lines 15 Of sportive wood run wild : these pastoral farms , Green to the very door ; and wreaths of smoke Sent up , in silence , from among the trees ! [ E ] With some uncertain notice , as might seem Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods , 20 Or of some Hermit 's cave , where by his fire The Hermit sits alone . These beauteous forms , Through a long absence , have not been to me<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>As is a landscape to a blind man 's eye : 25 But oft , in lonely rooms , and ‘ mid the din Of towns and cities , I have owed to them , In hours of weariness , sensations sweet , Felt in the blood , and felt along the heart ; And passing even into my purer mind ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>30 With tranquil restoration :— feelings too Of unremembered pleasure : such , perhaps , As have no slight or trivial influence<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>On that best portion of a good man 's life , His little , nameless , unremembered , acts 35 Of kindness and of love . Nor less , I trust , To them I may have owed another gift , Of aspect more sublime ; that blessed mood , In which the burthen of the mystery , In which the heavy and the weary weight 40 Of all this unintelligible world , Is lightened :— that serene and blessed mood , In which the affections gently lead us on ,— Until , the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood 45 Almost suspended , we are laid asleep In body , and become a living soul : While with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony , and the deep power of joy , We see into the life of things . 50 If this Be but a vain belief , yet , oh ! how oft — In darkness and amid the many shapes Of joyless daylight ; when the fretful stir Unprofitable , and the fever of the world , 55 Have hung upon the beatings of my heart — How oft , in spirit , have I turned to thee , O sylvan Wye ! thou wanderer thro ’ the woods ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>How often has my spirit turned to thee ! And now , with gleams of half-extinguished thought , 60 With many recognitions dim and faint , And somewhat of a sad perplexity , The picture of the mind revives again : While here I stand , not only with the sense Of present pleasure , but with pleasing thoughts 65 That in this moment there is life and food For future years . And so I dare to hope , Though changed , no doubt , from what I was when first I came among these hills ; when like a roe I bounded o'er the mountains , by the sides 70 Of the deep rivers , and the lonely streams , Wherever nature led : more like a man Flying from something that he dreads , than one Who sought the thing he loved . For nature then ( The coarser pleasures of my boyish days , 75 And their glad animal movements all gone by ) To me was all in all .— I cannot paint What then I was . The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion : the tall rock , The mountain , and the deep and gloomy wood , 80 Their colours and their forms , were then to me An appetite ; a feeling and a love , That had no need of a remoter charm , By thought supplied , nor<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>any interest Unborrowed from the eye .— That time is past , 85 And all its aching joys are now no more , And all its dizzy raptures . [ F ] Not for this Faint I , nor mourn nor murmur ; other gifts Have followed ; for such loss , I would believe , Abundant recompence . For I have learned 90 To look on nature , not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth ; but hearing oftentimes The still , sad music of humanity , Nor<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>harsh nor grating , though of ample power To chasten and subdue . And I have felt 95 A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , 100 And the blue sky , and in the mind of man : A motion and a spirit , that impels All thinking things , all objects of all thought , And rolls through all things . Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows and the woods , 105 And mountains ; and of all that we behold From this green earth ; of all the mighty world Of eye , and ear ,— both what they half create , [ G ] And what perceive ; well pleased to recognise In nature and the language of the sense , 110 The anchor of my purest thoughts , the nurse , The guide , the guardian of my heart , and soul Of all my moral being . Nor perchance , If I were not thus taught , should I the more 115 Suffer my genial spirits to decay : For thou art with me here upon the banks Of this fair river ; thou my dearest Friend , My dear , dear Friend ; and in thy voice I catch The language of my former heart , and read 120 My former pleasures in the shooting lights Of thy wild eyes , [ H ] Oh ! yet a little while May I behold in thee what I was once , My dear , dear Sister ! and this prayer I make , Knowing that Nature never did betray 125 The heart that loved her ; ‘ tis her privilege , Through all the years of this our life , to lead From joy to joy : for she can so inform The mind that is within us , so impress With quietness and beauty , and so feed 130 With lofty thoughts , that neither evil tongues , Rash judgments , nor the sneers of selfish men , Nor greetings where no kindness is , nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life , Shall e'er prevail against us , or disturb 135 Our cheerful faith , that all which we behold Is full of blessings . Therefore let the moon Shine on thee in thy solitary walk ; And let the misty mountain-winds be free To blow against thee : and , in after years , 140 When these wild ecstasies shall be matured Into a sober pleasure ; when thy mind Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms , Thy memory be as a dwelling-place For all sweet sounds and harmonies ; oh ! then , 145 If solitude , or fear , or pain , or grief , Should be thy portion , with what healing thoughts Of tender joy wilt thou remember me , And these my exhortations ! Nor , perchance — If I should be where I no more can hear 150 Thy voice , nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams Of past existence [ B ] — wilt thou then forget That on the banks of this delightful stream We stood together ; and that I , so long A worshipper of Nature , hither came 155 Unwearied in that service : rather say With warmer love — oh ! with far deeper zeal Of holier love . Nor wilt thou then forget , That after many wanderings , many years Of absence , these steep woods and lofty cliffs , 160 And this green pastoral landscape , were to me More dear , both for themselves and for thy sake !

       <l n="36">Wordsworth sent this fragment in MS. to Coleridge , who was then living</l>

     <p>“ The blank lines gave me as much direct pleasure as was possible in the general bustle of pleasure with which I received and read your letter . I observed , I remember , that the ‘ fingers woven , ’ etc ., only puzzled me ; and though I liked the twelve or fourteen first lines very well , yet I liked the remainder much better . Well , now I have read them again , they are very beautiful , and leave an affecting impression . That</p>
     <p>‘ uncertain heaven received Into the bosom of the steady lake , ’</p>
     <p>I should have recognised anywhere ; and had I met these lines , running wild in the deserts of Arabia , I should have instantly screamed out ‘ Wordsworth ’ ! ”</p>
     <p>The MS. copy of this poem sent to Coleridge probably lacked the explanatory line ,</p>
     <p>‘ Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth , ’</p>
     <p>as another MS ., in the possession of the poet 's grandson , lacks it ; and the line was possibly added — as the late Mr. Dykes Campbell suggested — “ in deference to S. T. C .' s expression of puzzlement . ”</p>
     <p>Fletcher Raincock — an elder brother of the William Raincock referred to in the Fenwick note to this poem , as Wordsworth 's schoolfellow at Hawkshead — was with him also at Cambridge . He attended Pembroke College , and was second wrangler in 1790 . [ B ] John Fleming of Rayrigg , his half-brother — the boy with whom Wordsworth used to walk round the lake of Esthwaite , in the morning before school-time , ( “ five miles of pleasant wandering ” ) — was also at St. John 's College , Cambridge , at this time , and had been fifth Wrangler in the preceding year , 1789 . He is referred to both in the second and the fifth books of ‘ The Prelude ’ ( see notes to that poem ) . It is perhaps not unworthy of note that Wrangham , whose French stanzas on “ The Birth of Love ” Wordsworth translated into English , was in the same year — 1789 — third Wrangler , second Smith 's prizeman , and first Chancellor 's medallist ; while Robert Greenwood , “ the Minstrel of the Troop , ” who “ blew his flute , alone upon the rock ” in Windermere ,— also one of the characters referred to in the second book of ‘ The Prelude ’ ,— was sixteenth Wrangler in Wordsworth 's year , viz . 1791 . William Raincock was at St. John 's College , Cambridge .— Ed .</p>

     <note>This is described from the life , as I was in the habit of observing when a boy at Hawkshead School . Daniel was more than eighty years older than myself when he was daily , thus occupied , under my notice . No books have so early taught me to think of the changes to which human life is subject , and while looking at him I could not but say to myself — we may , one of us , I or the happiest of my playmates , live to become still more the object of pity , than this old man , this half-doating pilferer .— I.

     <p>The poems belonging to the year 1799 were chiefly , if not wholly , composed at Goslar , in Germany ; and all , with three exceptions , appeared in the second edition of “ Lyrical Ballads ” ( 1800 ) . The exceptions were the following : The lyric beginning , “ I travelled among unknown men , ” which was first published in the “ Poems ” of 1807 ; and two fragments from ‘ The Prelude ’ , viz . ‘ The Influence of Natural Objects ’ ( which appeared in ‘ The Friend ’ in 1809 ) , and ‘ The Simplon Pass ’ ( first published in the 8vo edition of the Poems in 1845 ) .</p>
     <p>Wordsworth reached Goslar on the 6th of October 1798 , and left it on the 10th of February 1799 . It is impossible to determine the precise order in which the nineteen or twenty poems associated with that city were composed . But it is certain that the fragment on the immortal boy of Windermere — whom its cliffs and islands knew so well — was written in 1798 , and not in 1799 ( as Wordsworth himself states ) ; because Coleridge sent a letter to his friend , thanking him for a MS. copy of these lines , and commenting on them , of which the date is “ Ratzeburg , Dec. 10 , 1798 . ” For obvious reasons , however , I place the fragments originally meant to be parts of ‘ The Recluse ’ together ; and , since Wordsworth gave the date 1799 to the others , it would be gratuitous to suppose that he erred in reference to them all , because we know that his memory failed him in reference to one of the series . Therefore , although he spent more than twice as many days in 1798 as in 1799 at Goslar , I set down this group of poems as belonging to 1799 , rather than to the previous year . It will be seen that , after placing all the poems of this Goslar period in the year to which they belong , it is possible also to group them according to their subject matter , without violating chronological order . I therefore put the fragments , afterwards incorporated in ‘ The Prelude ’ , together . These are naturally followed by ‘ Nutting ’ — a poem intended for ‘ The Prelude ’ , but afterwards excluded , as inappropriate . The five poems referring to “ Lucy ” are placed in sequence , and the same is done with the four “ Matthew ” poems . A small group of four poems follows appropriately , viz . ‘ To a Sexton ’ , ‘ The Danish Boy ’ , ‘ Lucy Gray ’ , and ‘ Ruth ’ ; while the Fenwick note almost necessitates our placing the ‘ Poet 's Epitaph ’ immediately after the Lines ‘ Written in Germany ’ ; and , with Wordsworth 's life at Goslar , we naturally associate five things — the cold winter , ‘ The Prelude ’ , the “ Lucy ” and the “ Matthew ” poems , and the ‘ Poet 's Epitaph ’ .— Ed .</p>

      <head>NUTTING</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1799 .— Published 1800</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Written in Germany ; intended as part of a poem on my own life , but struck out as not being wanted there . Like most of my schoolfellows I was an impassioned Nutter . For this pleasure , the Vale of Esthwaite , abounding in coppice wood , furnished a very wide range . These verses arose out of the remembrance of feelings I had often had when a boy , and particularly in the extensive woods that still stretch from the side of Esthwaite Lake towards Graythwaite , the seat of the ancient family of Sandys .— I.

       <l n="3">One of those heavenly days that<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>cannot die ;</l>
       <l n="4">When , in the eagerness of boyish hope ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></l>
       <l n="5">I left our cottage-threshold , [ A ] sallying forth<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>5</l>
       <l n="6">With a huge wallet o'er my shoulders slung ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span></l>
       <l n="7">A nutting-crook in hand ; and turned<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>my steps</l>
       <l n="8">Tow'rd some far-distant wood ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>a Figure quaint ,</l>
       <l n="9">Tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weeds</l>
       <l n="10">Which for that service had been husbanded , 10</l>
       <l n="11">By exhortation of my frugal Dame —<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span></l>
       <l n="12">Motley accoutrement , of power to smile</l>
       <l n="13">At thorns , and brakes , and brambles ,— and , in truth ,</l>
       <l n="14">More ragged than need was ! O'er pathless rocks ,</l>
       <l n="15">Through beds of matted fern , and tangled thickets , 15</l>
       <l n="16">Forcing my way , I came to one dear nook<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
       <l n="17">Unvisited , where not a broken bough</l>
       <l n="18">Drooped with its withered leaves , ungracious sign</l>
       <l n="19">Of devastation ; but the hazels rose</l>
       <l n="20">Tall and erect , with tempting clusters<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>hung , 20</l>
       <l n="21">A virgin scene !— A little while I stood ,</l>
       <l n="22">Breathing with such suppression of the heart</l>
       <l n="23">As joy delights in ; and , with wise restraint</l>
       <l n="24">Voluptuous , fearless of a rival , eyed</l>
       <l n="25">The banquet ;— or beneath the trees I sate 25</l>
       <l n="26">Among the flowers , and with the flowers I played ;</l>
       <l n="27">A temper known to those , who , after long</l>
       <l n="28">And weary expectation , have been blest</l>
       <l n="29">With sudden happiness beyond all hope .</l>
       <l n="30">Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves 30</l>
       <l n="31">The violets of five seasons re-appear</l>
       <l n="32">And fade , unseen by any human eye ;</l>
       <l n="33">Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on</l>
       <l n="34">For ever ; and I saw the sparkling foam ,</l>
       <l n="35">And — with my cheek on one of those green stones 35</l>
       <l n="36">That , fleeced with moss , under<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>the shady trees ,</l>
       <l n="37">Lay round me , scattered like a flock of sheep —</l>
       <l n="38">I heard the murmur and the murmuring sound ,</l>
       <l n="39">In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay</l>
       <l n="40">Tribute to ease ; and , of its joy secure , 40</l>
       <l n="41">The heart luxuriates with indifferent things ,</l>
       <l n="42">Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones ,</l>
       <l n="43">And on the vacant air . Then up I rose ,</l>
       <l n="44">And dragged to earth both branch and bough , with crash</l>
       <l n="45">And merciless ravage : and the shady nook 45</l>
       <l n="46">Of hazels , and the green and mossy bower ,</l>
       <l n="47">Deformed and sullied , patiently gave up</l>
       <l n="48">Their quiet being : and , unless I now</l>
       <l n="49">Confound my present feelings with the past ;</l>
       <l n="50">Ere from the mutilated bower I turned<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>50</l>
       <l n="51">Exulting , rich beyond the wealth of kings ,</l>
       <l n="52">I felt a sense of pain when I beheld</l>
       <l n="53">The silent trees , and saw the intruding sky .—<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span></l>
       <l n="54">Then , dearest Maiden , move along these shades</l>
       <l n="55">In gentleness of heart ; with gentle hand 55</l>
       <l n="56">Touch — for there is a spirit in the woods .</l>

     <p>The woods round Esthwaite Lake have undergone considerable change since Wordsworth 's school-days at Hawkshead ; but hazel coppice is still abundant to the south and west of the Lake .— Ed .</p>

      <p>WRITTEN IN GERMANY , ON ONE OF THE COLDEST DAYS OF THE CENTURY</p>

     <p>I must apprize the Reader that the stoves in North Germany generally have the impression of a galloping Horse upon them , this being part of the Brunswick Arms .— W . W. 1800 .</p>
     <note>A bitter winter it was when these verses were composed by the side of my sister , in our lodgings at a draper 's house , in the romantic imperial town of Goslar , on the edge of the Hartz Forest . In this town the German emperors of the Franconian Line were accustomed to keep their court , and it retains vestiges of ancient splendour . So severe was the cold of this winter , that when we passed out of the parlour warmed by the stove , our cheeks were struck by the air as by cold iron . I slept in a room over a passage that was not ceiled . The people of the house used to say rather unfeelingly , that they expected I should be frozen to death some night ; but with the protection of a pelisse lined with fur , and a dog 's skin bonnet , such as was worn by the peasants , I walked daily on the ramparts , or on a sort of public ground or garden , in which was a pond . Here I had no companion but a kingfisher , a beautiful creature that used to glance by me . I consequently became much attached to it . During these walks I composed the poem that follows , A Poet 's Epitaph .— I. F .</note>

     <p>To this poem , when first published in the “ Poems of Early and Late Years ” ( 1842 ) , Wordsworth appended the note , “ See , upon the subject of the three foregoing pieces , ‘ The Fountain ’ [ p. 91 ] , etc . etc . in the fifth volume of the Author 's Poems . ” He thus connects it with the poems referring to Matthew in such a way that it may be said to belong to that series ; and , while he assigned it to the year 1798 , both in the edition of 1845 , and in that of 1849-50 , it is quite possible that it was written in 1799 . “ The village school ” was the Grammar School of Hawkshead , where Wordsworth spent his boyhood ; and the schoolmaster was the Rev . William Taylor , M. A ., Emmanuel College , Cambridge , who was the third of the four masters who taught in it during Wordsworth 's residence there . He was master from 1782 to 1786 . Just before his death he sent for the upper boys of the school ( amongst whom was Wordsworth ) , and calling them into his room , took leave of them with a solemn blessing . This farewell doubtless suggested the lines :</p>
     <p>‘ the blessing which to you Our common Friend and Father sent . ’</p>
     <p>Mr. Taylor was buried in Cartmell Churchyard . In ‘ The Prelude ’ , Wordsworth writes of him as “ an honoured teacher of my youth ; ” and there describes , with some minuteness , a visit to his grave . ( See book x. l . 532 . ) It will be seen , however , from the Fenwick note to ‘ Matthew ’ , that the Hawkshead Schoolmaster , like the Wanderer in ‘ The Excursion ’ , was “ made up of several both of his class and men of other occupations ; ” but of the four masters who taught Wordsworth at Hawkshead — Peake , Christian , Taylor , and Bowman — Taylor was far the ablest , the most interesting , and the most beloved by the boys , and it was doubtless the memory of this man that gave rise to the above poem , and the four which follow it . He was but thirty-two years old when he died , 12th June , 1786 . This fact , taken in connection with line 14 of the ‘ Address ’ , may illustrate the composite character of ‘ Matthew ’ .— Ed .</p>

     <p>In the School of — is a tablet on which are inscribed , in gilt letters , the names of the several persons who have been Schoolmasters there since the foundation of the School , with the time at which they entered upon and quitted their office . Opposite one of those names the Author wrote the following lines .— W . W. 1800 .</p>
     <note>Such a tablet as is here spoken of continued to be preserved in Hawkshead School , though the inscriptions were not brought down to our time . This , and other poems connected with Matthew , would not gain by a literal detail of facts . Like the Wanderer in ‘ The Excursion ’ this Schoolmaster was made up of several , both of his class and men of other occupations . I do not ask pardon for what there is of untruth in such verses , considered strictly as matters of fact . It is enough , if , being true and consistent in spirit , they move and teach in a manner not unworthy of a Poet 's calling .— I. F . ] [ A</note>
     <p>In the editions of 1800 to 1820 this poem had no title except the note prefixed to it above , although in the Table of Contents it was called ‘ Lines written on a Tablet in a School ’ . From 1820-32 “ Matthew ” is the page heading , though there is no title . In the editions of 1827 and 1832 it was named , in the Table of Contents , by its first line , “ If Nature , for a favourite child . ” In 1837 it was entitled ‘ Matthew ’ . It was included among the “ Poems of Sentiment and Reflection . ” The Tablet , with the names of the Masters inscribed on it , still exists in Hawkshead School .— Ed .</p>

      <head>LUCY GRAY ; OR , SOLITUDE</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1799 .— Published 1800</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Written at Goslar , in Germany , in 1799 . It was founded on a circumstance told me by my sister , of a little girl , who , not far from Halifax in Yorkshire , was bewildered in a snow storm . Her footsteps were tracked by her parents to the middle of a lock of a canal , and no other vestige of her , backward or forward , could be traced . The body , however , was found in the canal . The way in which the incident was treated , and the spiritualizing of the character , might furnish hints for contrasting the imaginative influences , which I have endeavoured to throw over common life , with Crabbe 's matter-of-fact style of handling subjects of the same kind . This is not spoken to his disparagement , far from it ; but to direct the attention of thoughtful readers into whose hands these notes may fall , to a comparison that may enlarge the circle of their sensibilities , and tend to produce in them a catholic judgment .— I.

     <p>This poem was illustrated by Sir George Beaumont , in a picture of some merit , which was engraved by J. C. Bromley , and published in the collected editions of 1815 and 1820 . Henry Crabb Robinson wrote in his ‘ Diary ’ , September 11 , 1816 ( referring to Wordsworth ):</p>
     <p>“ He mentioned the origin of some poems . ‘ Lucy Gray ’ , that tender and pathetic narrative of a child lost on a common , was occasioned by the death of a child who fell into the lock of a canal . His object was to exhibit poetically entire ‘ solitude ’ , and he represents the child as observing the day-moon , which no town or village girl would ever notice . ”</p>

     <p>“ THE SCENE OF ‘ LUCY GRAY ’ .— In one of the editions of Wordsworth 's works the scene of this ballad is said to have been near Halifax , in Yorkshire . I do not think the poet was acquainted with the locality beyond a sight of the country in travelling through on some journey . I know of no spot where all the little incidents mentioned in the poem would exactly fit in , and a few of the local allusions are evidently by a stranger . There is no ‘ minster ’ ; the church at Halifax from time immemorial has always been known as the ‘ parish church , ’ and sometimes as the ‘ old church , ’ but has never been styled ‘ the minster . ’ The ‘ mountain roe , ’ which of course may be brought in as poetically illustrative , has not been seen on these hills for generations , and I scarcely think even the ‘ fawn at play ’ for more than a hundred years . These misapplications , it is almost unnecessary to say , do not detract from the beauty of the poetry . Some of the touches are graphically true to the neighbourhood , as , for instance , ‘ the wide moor , ’ the ‘ many a hill , ’ the ‘ steep hill 's edge , ’ the ‘ long stone wall , ’ and the hint of the general loneliness of the region where Lucy ‘ no mate , no comrade , knew . ’ I think I can point out the exact spot — no longer a ‘ plank , ’ but a broad , safe bridge — where Lucy fell into the water . Taking a common-sense view , that she would not be sent many miles at two o'clock on a winter afternoon to the town ( Halifax , of course ) , over so lonely a mountain moor — bearing in mind also that this moor overlooked the river , and that the river was deep and strong enough to carry the child down the current — I know only one place where such an accident could have occurred . The clue is in this verse :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ At day-break on a hill they stood</l>
       <l n="2">That overlooked the moor ;</l>
       <l n="3">And thence they saw the bridge of wood ,</l>
       <l n="4">A furlong from their door . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The hill I take to be the high ridge of Greetland and Norland Moor , and the plank she had to cross Sterne Mill Bridge , which there spans the Calder , broad and rapid enough at any season to drown either a young girl or a grown-up person . The mountain burns , romantic and wild though they be , are not dangerous to cross , especially for a child old enough to go and seek her mother . To sum up the matter , the hill overlooking the moor , the path to and distance from the town , the bridge , the current , all indicate one point , and one point only , where this accident could have happened , and that is the bridge near Sterne Mill . This bridge is so designated from the Sterne family , a branch of whom in the last century resided close by . The author of ‘ Tristram Shandy ’ spent his boyhood here ; and Lucy Gray , had she safely crossed the plank , would immediately have passed Wood Hall , where the boy Laurence had lived , and , pursuing her way to Halifax , would have gone through the meadows in which stood Heath School , where young Sterne had been educated . The mill-weir at Sterne Mill Bridge was , I believe , the scene of Lucy Gray 's death . ”</p>
     <p>Sterne Mill Bridge , however , crosses the river Calder , while Wordsworth tells us that the girl lost her life by falling “ into the lock of a canal . ” The Calder runs parallel with the canal near Sterne Mill Bridge . See J. R. Tutin 's ‘ Wordsworth in Yorkshire ’ .— Ed .</p>

     <p>“ Sunday , March 8th , 1802 .— I stitched up ‘ The Pedlar , ’ wrote out ‘ Ruth ’ , read it with the alterations .... William brought two new stanzas of ‘ Ruth ’ . ”</p>
     <p>The transpositions of stanzas , and their omission from certain editions and their subsequent re-introduction , in altered form , in later ones , make it extremely difficult to give the textual history of ‘ Ruth ’ in footnotes . They are even more bewildering than the changes introduced into ‘ Simon Lee ’ .— Ed .</p>

     <p>Towards the close of December 1799 , Wordsworth came to live at Dove Cottage , Town-end , Grasmere . The poems written during the following year ( 1800 ) , are more particularly associated with that district of the Lakes . Two of them were fragments of a canto of ‘ The Recluse ’ , entitled “ Home at Grasmere , ” referring to his settlement at Dove Cottage . Others , such as ‘ Michael ’ , and ‘ The Brothers ’ — classed by him afterwards among the “ Poems founded on the Affections , ” — deal with incidents in the rural life of the dalesmen of Westmoreland and Cumberland . Most of the “ Poems on the Naming of Places ” were written during this year ; and the “ Places ” are all in the neighbourhood of Grasmere . To these were added several “ Pastoral Poems ” — such as ‘ The Idle Shepherd Boys ; or , Dungeon-Ghyll Force ’ — sundry “ Poems of the Fancy , ” and one or two “ Inscriptions . ” In all , twenty-five poems were written in the year 1800 ; and , with the exception of the two fragments of ‘ The Recluse ’ , they were published during the same year in the second volume of the second edition of “ Lyrical Ballads . ” It is impossible to fix the precise date of the composition of the fragments of ‘ The Recluse ’ ; but , as they refer to the settlement at Dove Cottage — where Wordsworth went to reside with his sister , on the 21st of December 1799 — they may fitly introduce the poems belonging to the year 1800 . They were first published in 1851 in the ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ ( vol . i. pp . 157 and 155 respectively ) , by the poet 's nephew , the late Bishop of Lincoln . The entire canto of ‘ The Recluse ’ , entitled “ Home at Grasmere , ” will be included in this edition .</p>
     <p>The first two poems which follow , as belonging to the year 1800 , are parts of ‘ The Recluse ’ , viz . “ On Nature 's invitation do I come , ” ( which is ll . 71-97 , and 110-125 ) , and “ Bleak season was it , turbulent and bleak , ” ( which is ll . 152-167 ) . They are not reprinted from the ‘ Memoirs ’ of 1851 , because the text there given was , in several instances , inaccurately reproduced from the original MS ., which has been re-examined . They were printed here , in ‘ The Recluse ‘ ( 1888 ) , and in my ‘ Life of Wordsworth ’ ( vol . i . 1889 ) .— Ed .</p>

       <l n="44">This Grasmere cottage is identified , much more than Rydal Mount , with</l>
       <l n="45">Wordsworth 's “ poetic prime . ” It had once been a public-house , bearing</l>
       <l n="46">the sign of the Dove and Olive Bough — and as such is referred to in ‘ The</l>
       <l n="47">Waggoner ’ — from which circumstance it was for a long time , and is now</l>
       <l n="48">usually , called “ Dove Cottage . ” A small two storied house , it is</l>
       <l n="49">described somewhat minutely — as it was in Wordsworth 's time — by De</l>
       <l n="50">Quincey , in his ‘ Recollections of the Lakes ’ , and by the late Bishop of</l>
       <l n="51">Lincoln , in the ‘ Memoirs ’ of his uncle .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The front of it faces the lake ; behind is a small plot of orchard and garden ground , in which there is a spring and rocks ; the enclosure shelves upwards towards the woody sides of the mountains above it . ” [ A ]</p>
     <p>The following is De Quincey 's description of it , as he saw it in the summer of 1807 .</p>
     <p>“ A white cottage , with two yew trees breaking the glare of its white walls ” ( these yews still stand on the eastern side of the cottage ) . “ A little semi-vestibule between two doors prefaced the entrance into what might be considered the principal room of the cottage . It was an oblong square , not above eight and a half feet high , sixteen feet long , and twelve broad ; wainscoted from floor to ceiling with dark polished oak , slightly embellished with carving . One window there was — a perfect and unpretending cottage window , with little diamond panes , embowered at almost every season of the year with roses ; and , in the summer and autumn , with a profusion of jasmine , and other fragrant shrubs .... I was ushered up a little flight of stairs , fourteen in all , to a little drawing-room , or whatever the reader chooses to call it . Wordsworth himself has described the fireplace of this room as his</p>
     <p>‘ Half-kitchen and half-parlour fire . ’</p>
     <p>It was not fully seven feet six inches high , and in other respects pretty nearly of the same dimensions as the rustic hall below . There was , however , in a small recess , a library of perhaps three hundred volumes , which seemed to consecrate the room as the poet 's study and composing room , and such occasionally it was . But far oftener he both studied , as I found , and composed on the high road . ” [ B ]</p>
     <p>Other poems of later years refer , much more fully than the above , to this cottage , and its orchard ground , where so many of Wordsworth 's lyrics were composed .</p>
     <p>The “ orchard ground , ” which was for the most part in grass , sloped upwards ; but a considerable portion of the natural rock was exposed ; and on its face , some rough stone steps were cut by Wordsworth , helped by a near neighbour of his — John Fisher — so as more conveniently to reach the upper terrace , where the poet built for himself a small arbour . All this garden and orchard ground is not much altered since 1800 . The short terrace walk is curved , with a sloping bank of grass above , shaded by apple trees , hazel , holly , laburnum , laurel , and mountain ash . Below the terrace is the well , which supplied the cottage in Wordsworth 's time ; and there large leaved primroses still grow , doubtless the successors of those planted by his own and his sister 's hands . Above , and amongst the rocks , are the daffodils , which they also brought to their “ garden-ground ; ” the Christmas roses , which they planted near the well , were removed to the eastern side of the garden , where they flourished luxuriantly in 1882 ; but have now , alas ! disappeared . The box-wood planted by the poet grows close to the cottage . The arbour is now gone ; but , in the place where it stood , a seat is erected . The hidden brook still sings its under-song , as it used to do , “ its quiet soul on all bestowing , ” and the green linnet may doubtless be seen now , as it used to be in 1803 . The allusions to the garden ground at Dove Cottage , in the poems which follow , will be noted as they occur .— Ed .</p>

     <p>This poem refers to a winter journey on foot , which Wordsworth and his sister took from Sockburn to Grasmere , by Wensleydale and Askrigg ; and , since he has left us an account of this journey , in a letter to Coleridge , written a few days after their arrival at Grasmere — a letter in which his characterisation of Nature is almost as happy as it is in his best poems — some extracts from it may here be appended .</p>
     <p>“ We left Sockburn last Tuesday morning . We crossed the Tees by moonlight in the Sockburn fields , and after ten good miles riding came in sight of the Swale . It is there a beautiful river , with its green banks and flat holms scattered over with trees . Four miles further brought us to Richmond , with its huge ivied castle , its friarage steeple , its castle tower resembling a huge steeple .... We were now in Wensleydale , and D. and I set off side by side to foot it as far as Kendal .... We reached Askrigg , twelve miles , before six in the evening , having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard frozen roads .... Next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow , enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery . On leaving Askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall . It was a beautiful morning , with driving snow showers , which disappeared by fits , and unveiled the east , which was all one delicious pale orange colour . After walking through two small fields we came to a mill , which we passed , and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before us , with an area of grassy ground , and a stream dashing over various laminæ of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs ; the bank and stream on our left , another woody bank on our right , and the flat meadow in front , from which , as at Buttermere , the stream had retired , as it were , to hide itself under the shade . As we walked up this delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the stream , which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the gloomy rocks , with a brightness varying with the agitation of the current . The steeple of Askrigg was between us and the east , at the bottom of the valley ; it was not a quarter of a mile distant .... The two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to them both . When we reached this bottom the valley opened out again ; two rocky banks on each side , which , hung with ivy and moss , and fringed luxuriantly with brushwood , ran directly parallel to each other , and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of union , presented a lofty waterfall , the termination of the valley . It was a keen frosty morning , showers of snow threatening us , but the sun bright and active . We had a task of twenty-one miles to perform in a short winter 's day .... On a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible moulderings in the wall of an old castle . We left this spot with reluctance , but highly exhilarated .... It was bitter cold , the wind driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm . We soon reached an inn at a place called Hardrane , and descending from our vehicles , after warming ourselves by the cottage fire , we walked up the brook-side to take a view of a third waterfall . We had not walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks before we came full upon the waterfall , which seemed to throw itself in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock , the water , which shot manifestly to some distance from the rock , seeming to be dispersed into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason . We were disappointed in the cascade itself , though the introductory and accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and beauty .... After cautiously sounding our way over stones of all colours and sizes , encased in the clearest water formed by the spray of the fall , we found the rock , which before had appeared like a wall , extending itself over our heads , like the ceiling of a huge cave , from the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a bason , and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white as snow , or rather , as Dorothy says , like congealed froth . The water fell at least ten yards from us , and we stood directly behind it , the excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of darkness , but lofty and magnificent ; but in connection with the adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared from a scene so exquisitely beautiful . The spot where we stood was as dry as the chamber in which I am now sitting , and the incumbent rock , of which the groundwork was limestone , veined and dappled with colours which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour . On the summit of the cave were three festoons , or rather wrinkles , in the rock , run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up . Each of these was hung with icicles of various length , and nearly in the middle of the festoon , in the deepest valley of the waves that ran parallel to each other , the stream shot from the rows of icicles in irregular fits of strength , and with a body of water that varied every moment . Sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued current ; sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall , and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from our feet like the heaviest thunder shower . In such a situation you have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky . Large fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water , and the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant . The rocks on each side , which , joining with the side of this cave , formed the vista of the brook , were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls , or rather courses of water . Each of these was a miniature of all that summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty . The rock in the centre of the falls , where the water was most abundant , a deep black , the adjoining parts yellow , white , purple , and dove colour , covered with water — plants of the most vivid green , and hung with streaming icicles , that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks ; and in some places render the colours more brilliant . I cannot express to you the enchanting effect produced by this Arabian scene of colour as the wind blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood , and alternately hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular succession , or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed . What a scene too in summer ! In the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding upon the pleasure which this cave , in the heat of a July noon , would spread through a frame exquisitely sensible . That huge rock on the right , the bank winding round on the left with all its living foliage , and the breeze stealing up the valley , and bedewing the cavern with the freshest imaginable spray . And then the murmur of the water , the quiet , the seclusion , and a long summer day . ”</p>

     <note>It may be worth while to observe that as there are Scotch Poems on this subject in simple ballad strain , I thought it would be both presumptuous and superfluous to attempt treating it in the same way ; and , accordingly , I chose a construction of stanza quite new in our language ; in fact , the same as that of Bürger 's ‘ Leonora ’ , except that the first and third lines do not , in my stanzas , rhyme . At the outset I threw out a classical image to prepare the reader for the style in which I meant to treat the story , and so to preclude all comparison .— I. F .</note>

     <p>No Scottish ballad is superior in pathos to ‘ Helen of Kirkconnell ’ . It is based on a traditionary tale — the date of the event being lost — but the locality , in the parish of Kirkpatrick-Fleming in Dumfriesshire , is known ; and there the graves of “ Burd Helen ” and her lover are still pointed out .</p>
     <p>The following is Sir Walter Scott 's account of the story :</p>
     <p>“ A lady of the name of Helen Irving , or Bell ( for this is disputed by the two clans ) , daughter of the laird of Kirkconnell in Dumfriesshire , and celebrated for her beauty , was beloved by two gentlemen in the neighbourhood . The name of the favoured suitor was Adam Fleming of Kirkpatrick : that of the other has escaped tradition , although it has been alleged he was a Bell of Blackel-house . The addresses of the latter were , however , favoured by the friends of the lady , and the lovers were therefore obliged to meet in secret , and by night , in the Churchyard of Kirkconnell , a romantic spot , surrounded by the river Kirtle . During one of their private interviews , the jealous and despised lover suddenly appeared on the opposite bank of the stream , and levelled his carbine at the breast of his rival . Helen threw herself before her lover , received in her bosom the bullet , and died in his arms . A desperate and mortal combat ensued between Fleming and the murderer , in which the latter was cut to pieces . ”</p>

     <p>The original ballad — well known though it is — may be quoted as an admirable illustration of the different types of poetic genius in dealing with the same , or a kindred , theme .</p>

     <note>Written at Town-end , Grasmere . The first eight stanzas were composed extempore one winter evening in the cottage , when , after having tired myself with labouring at an awkward passage in ‘ The Brothers ’ , I started with a sudden impulse to this to get rid of the other , and finished it in a day or two . My sister and I had passed the place a few weeks before in our wild winter journey from Sockburn on the banks of the Tees to Grasmere . A peasant whom we met near the spot told us the story so far as concerned the name of the Well , and the Hart , and pointed out the Stones . Both the stones and the well are objects that may easily be missed . The tradition by this time may be extinct in the neighbourhood . The man who related it to us was very old .— I . F .</note>

     <p>This poem was suggested to Wordsworth in December 1799 during the journey with his sister from Sockburn in Yorkshire to Grasmere . I owe the following local note on ‘ Hart-Leap Well ’ to Mr. John R. Tutin of Hull .</p>
     <p>“ June 20 , 1881 . Visited ‘ Hart-Leap Well , ’ the subject of Wordsworth 's poem . It is situated on the road side leading from Richmond to Askrigg , at a distance of not more than three and a-half miles from Richmond , and not five miles as stated in the prefatory note to the poem . The ‘ three aspens at three corners of a square ’ are things of the past ; also the ‘ three stone pillars standing in a line , on the hill above . In a straight line with the spring of water , and where the pillars would have been , a wall has been built ; so that it is very probable the stone pillars were removed at the time of the building of this wall . The scenery around answers exactly to the description</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">More doleful place did never eye survey ;</l>
       <l n="2">It seemed as if the spring time came not here ,</l>
       <l n="3">And Nature here were willing to decay .</l>
       <l n="4">...</l>
       <l n="5">Now , here is neither grass nor pleasant shade .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ It is barren moor for miles around . The water still falls into the ‘ cup of stone , ’ which appeared to be of very long standing . Within ten yards of the well is a small tree , at the same side of the road as the well , on the right hand coming from Richmond . ”</p>
     <p>The Rev . Thomas Hutchinson of Kimbolton wrote to me on June 18 , 1883 :</p>
     <p>“ The tree is not a Thorn , but a Lime . It is evidently an old one , but is now in full and beautiful leaf . It stands on the western side of the road , and a few yards distant from it . The well is somewhat nearer the road . This side of the road is open to the fell . On the other side the road is bounded by a stone wall : another wall meeting this one at right angles , exactly opposite the well . I ascended the hill on the north side of this wall for some distance , but could find no trace of any rough-hewn stone . Descending on the other side , I found in the wall one , and only one , such stone . I should say the base was in the wall . The stone itself leans outwards ; so that , at the top , three of its square faces can be seen ; and two , if not three , of these faces bear marks of being hammer-dressed . The distance from the stone to the well is about 40 yards , and the height of the stone out of the ground about 3 or 4 feet .</p>
     <p>“ The ascent from the well is a gentle one , not ‘ sheer ’ ; nor does there appear to be any hollow by which the shepherd could ascend . On the western side of the road there is a wide plain , with a slight fall in that direction . ”</p>

      <head>THE IDLE SHEPHERD-BOYS ; OR , DUNGEON-GHYLL FORCE [ A ]</head>
      <head>A PASTORAL</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1800 .— Published 1800</l>
     </lg>
     <p>[ Written at Town-end , Grasmere . I will only add a little monitory anecdote concerning this subject . When Coleridge and Southey were walking together upon the Fells , Southey observed that , if I wished to be considered a faithful painter of rural manners , I ought not to have said that my shepherd-boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the poem . Just as the words had passed his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats . I have often wondered that Southey , who rambled so much about the mountains , should have fallen into this mistake , and I record it as a warning for others who , with far less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are , and far less sagacity , give way to presumptuous criticism , from which he was free , though in this matter mistaken . In describing a tarn under Helvellyn I say :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ There sometimes doth a leaping fish</l>
       <l n="2">Send through the tarn a lonely cheer . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>This was branded by a critic of these days , in a review ascribed to Mrs. Barbauld , as unnatural and absurd . I admire the genius of Mrs. Barbauld and am certain that , had her education been favourable to imaginative influences , no female of her day would have been more likely to sympathise with that image , and to acknowledge the truth of the sentiment .— I .

      <head>A PASTORAL</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1800 .— Published 1800</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Written at Town-end , Grasmere . Barbara Lewthwaite , now living at Ambleside ( 1843 ) , though much changed as to beauty , was one of two most lovely sisters . Almost the first words my poor brother John said , when he visited us for the first time at Grasmere , were , “ Were those two Angels that I have just seen ? ” and from his description , I have no doubt they were those two sisters . The mother died in childbed ; and one of our neighbours at Grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her babe in her arm . I mention this to notice what I cannot but think a salutary custom once universal in these vales . Every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed , which was never done ( nor I believe is now ) till a minute or two before the corpse was removed . Barbara Lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom I had seen and overheard as described in the poem . I chose the name for reasons implied in the above ; and here will add a caution against the use of names of living persons . Within a few months after the publication of this poem , I was much surprised , and more hurt , to find it in a child 's school book , which , having been compiled by Lindley Murray , had come into use at Grasmere School where Barbara was a pupil ; and , alas ! I had the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of being thus distinguished ; and , in after life she used to say that she remembered the incident , and what I said to her upon the occasion .— I .

      <head>THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1800 .— Published 1815 [ A ]</l>
     </lg>
     <note>The character of this man was described to me , and the incident upon which the verses turn was told me , by Mr. Poole of Nether Stowey , with whom I became acquainted through our common friend , S. T. Coleridge . During my residence at Alfoxden , I used to see much of him , and had frequent occasions to admire the course of his daily life , especially his conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours ; their virtues he carefully encouraged , and weighed their faults in the scales of charity . If I seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer and his transgressions too tenderly , it may in part be ascribed to my having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment . After his death was found in his escritoir , a lock of grey hair carefully preserved , with a notice that it had been cut from the head of his faithful shepherd , who had served him for a length of years . I need scarcely add that he felt for all men as his brothers . He was much beloved by distinguished persons — Mr. Coleridge , Mr. Southey , Sir H. Davy , and many others ; and in his own neighbourhood was highly valued as a magistrate , a man of business , and in every other social relation . The latter part of the poem perhaps requires some apology , as being too much of an echo to ‘ The Reverie of Poor Susan ’ .— I. F .</note>

     <p>The text of the “ Poems on the Naming of Places ” underwent comparatively little alteration in successive editions . Both the changes in the first poem were made in 1845 . From the Fenwick note , it is evident that “ the Rivulet ” was Easdale beck . But where was “ Emma 's Dell ” ? In the autumn of 1877 , Dr. Cradock , the Principal of Brasenose College , Oxford , took me to a place , of which he afterwards wrote ,</p>
     <p>“ I have a fancy for a spot just beyond Goody Bridge to the left , where the brook makes a curve , and returns to the road two hundred yards farther on . But I have not discovered a trace of authority in favour of the idea farther than that the wooded bend of the brook with the stepping stones across it , connected with a field-path recently stopped , was a very favourite haunt of Wordsworth 's . At the upper part of this bend , near to the place where the brook returns to the road , is a deep pool at the foot of a rush of water . In this pool , a man named Wilson was drowned many years ago . He lived at a house on the hill called Score Crag , which , if my conjecture as to Emma 's Dell is right , is the ‘ single mountain cottage ’ on a ‘ summit , distant a short space . ’ Wordsworth , happening to be walking at no great distance , heard a loud shriek . It was that of Mr. Wilson , the father , who had just discovered his son 's body in the beck . ”</p>
     <p>In the “ Reminiscences ” of the poet , by the Hon . Mr. Justice Coleridge , which were contributed to the ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ , written by his nephew ( vol . ii . pp . 300-315 ) , there is a record of a walk they took up Easdale to this place , entering the field just at the spot which Dr. Cradock supposes to be “ Emma 's Dell . ”</p>
     <p>“ He turned aside at a little farm-house , and took us into a swelling field to look down on the tumbling stream which bounded it , and which we saw precipitated at a distance , in a broad white sheet , from the mountain . ” ( This refers to Easdale Force . ) “ Then , as he mused for an instant , he said ,</p>
     <p>‘ I have often thought what a solemn thing it would be could we have brought to our mind at once all the scenes of distress and misery which any spot , however beautiful and calm before us , has been witness to since the beginning . That water break , with the glassy quiet pool beneath it , that looks so lovely , and presents no images to the mind but of peace — there , I remember , the only son of his father , a poor man who lived yonder , was drowned . ’ ”</p>
     <p>This walk and conversation took place in October 1836 . If any one is surprised that Wordsworth , supposing him to have been then looking into the very dell on which he wrote the above poem in 1800 , did not name it to Mr. Coleridge , he must remember that he was not in the habit of speaking of the places he had memorialised in verse , and that in 1836 his “ Sister Emmeline ” had for a year been a confirmed invalid at Rydal . I have repeatedly followed Easdale beck all the way up from its junction with the Rothay to the Tarn , and found no spot corresponding so closely to the realistic detail of this poem as the one suggested by Dr. Cradock . There are two places further up the dale where the “ sallies of glad sound ” such as are referred to in the poem , are even more distinctly audible ; but they are not at “ a sudden turning , ” as is the spot above Goody Bridge . If one leaves the Easdale road at this bridge , and keeps to the side of the beck for a few hundred yards , till he reaches the turning ,— especially if it be a bright April morning , such as that described in the poem ,— and remembers that this path by the brook was a favourite resort of Wordsworth and his sister , the probability of Dr. Cradock 's suggestion will be apparent . Lady Richardson , who knew the place , and appreciated the poem as thoroughly as any of Wordsworth 's friends , told me that she concurred in this identification of the “ dell . ” — Ed .</p>

     <p>In Cumberland and Westmoreland are several Inscriptions upon the native rock which from the wasting of Time and the rudeness of the Workmanship had been mistaken for Runic . They are without doubt Roman .</p>
     <p>The Rotha , mentioned in this poem , is the River which flowing through the Lakes of Grasmere and Rydale falls into Wyndermere . On Helm-Crag , that impressive single Mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere , is a Rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an Old Woman cowering . Close by this rock is one of those Fissures or Caverns , which in the language of the Country are called Dungeons . The other Mountains either immediately surround the Vale of Grasmere , or belong to the same Cluster .— W . W. 1800 .</p>
     <p>Most of the Mountains here mentioned immediately surround the vale of Grasmere ; of the others , some are at a considerable distance , but they belong to the same cluster .— W . W. 1802 .</p>
     <p>The majority of the changes introduced into the text of this poem were made in the year 1836 .</p>
     <p>The place where the echo of the bleat of the lamb was heard — referred to in the Fenwick note — may be easily found . The “ precipice ” is Pavy Ark . “ The ‘ lofty firs , that overtop their ancient neighbour , the old steeple-tower , ’ stood by the roadside , scarcely twenty yards north-west from the steeple of Grasmere church . Their site is now included in the road , which has been widened at that point . They were Scotch firs of unusual size , and might justly be said to ‘ overtop their neighbour ’ the tower . Mr. Fleming Green , who well remembers the trees , gave me this information , which is confirmed by other inhabitants .</p>
     <p>“ When the road was enlarged , not many years ago , the roots of the trees were found by the workmen . ”</p>
     <p>( Dr. Cradock to the editor . ) The</p>
     <p>‘ tall rock That eastward looks ’</p>
     <p>by the banks of the Rotha , presenting a “ lofty barrier ” “ from base to summit , ” is manifestly a portion of Helmcrag . It is impossible to know whether Wordsworth carved Joanna Hutchinson 's name anywhere on Helmcrag , and it is useless to enquire . If he did so , the discovery of the place would not help any one to understand or appreciate the poem . It is obvious that he did not intend to be literally exact in details , as the poem was written in 1800 , and addressed to Joanna Hutchinson ,— who is spoken of as having been absent from Grasmere “ for two long years ; ” and Wordsworth says that he carved the Runic characters ‘ in memoriam ’ eighteen months after that summer morning when he heard the echo of her laugh . But the family took up residence at Grasmere only in December 1799 , and the “ Poems on the Naming of Places ” were published before the close of 1800 . The effect of these lines to Joanna , however , is certainly not impaired — it may even be enhanced — by our inability to localise them . Only one in the list of places referred to can occasion any perplexity , viz ., Hammar-scar , since it is a name now disused in the district . It used to be applied to some rocks on the flank of Silver-how , to the wood around them , and also to the gorge between Silver-how and Loughrigg . Hammar , from the old Norse ‘ hamar ’ , signifies a steep broken rock .</p>
     <p>The imaginative description of the echo of the lady 's laugh suggests a parallel passage from Michael Drayton 's ‘ Polyolbion ’ , which Wordsworth must doubtless have read . ( See his sister 's reference to Drayton in her ‘ Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland ’ , in 1803 : in the note to the poem , ‘ At the grave of Burns ’ , p. 382 of this volume . )</p>

     <p>Any one who compares this passage with Wordsworth 's ‘ Joanna ’ will see the difference between the elaborate fancy of a topographical narrator , and the vivid imagination of a poetical idealist . A somewhat similar instance of indebtedness — in which the debt is repaid by additional insight — is seen when we compare a passage from Sir John Davies 's ‘ Orchestra , or a poem on Dancing ’ ( stanza 49 ) , with one from ‘ The Ancient Mariner ’ , Part VI . stanzas 2 and 3 — although there was more of the true imaginative light in Davies than in Drayton .</p>

      <head>COLERIDGE .</head>
      <head>These extracts show how both Wordsworth and Coleridge assimilated past literary products , and how they glorified them by reproduction . There was little , however , in the poetic imagery of previous centuries that Wordsworth reproduced . His imagination worked in a sphere of its own , free from the trammels of precedent ; and he was more original than any other nineteenth century poet in his use of symbol and metaphor . The poem ‘ To Joanna ’ was probably composed on August 22 , 1800 , as the following occurs in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal under that date :</head>

       <l n="19">That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake ,</l>
       <l n="20">Suddenly halting now — a lifeless stand ! 20</l>
       <l n="21">And starting off again with freak as sudden ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>

       <l n="39">— So fared we that bright<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>morning : from the fields ,</l>
       <l n="40">Meanwhile , a noise was heard , the busy mirth 40</l>
       <l n="41">Of reapers , men and women , boys and girls .</l>
       <l n="42">Delighted much to listen<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>to those sounds ,</l>
       <l n="43">And feeding thus our fancies , we advanced<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></l>
       <l n="44">Along the indented shore ; when suddenly ,</l>
       <l n="45">Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>45</l>
       <l n="46">Before us , on a point of jutting land ,</l>
       <l n="47">The tall and upright figure of a Man</l>
       <l n="48">Attired in peasant 's garb , who stood alone ,</l>
       <l n="49">Angling beside the margin of the lake .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
       <l n="50">“ Improvident and reckless , ” we exclaimed , 50</l>
       <l n="51">“ The Man must be , who thus can lose a day<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></l>

       <l n="55">Thus talking of that Peasant , we approached 55</l>
       <l n="56">Close to the spot where with his rod and line</l>
       <l n="57">He stood alone ; whereat he turned his head</l>
       <l n="58">To greet us — and we saw a Man worn down</l>
       <l n="59">By sickness , gaunt and lean , with sunken cheeks</l>
       <l n="60">And wasted limbs , his legs so long and lean 60</l>
       <l n="61">That for my single self I looked at them ,</l>
       <l n="62">Forgetful of the body they sustained .—</l>
       <l n="63">Too weak to labour in the harvest field ,</l>
       <l n="64">The Man was using his best skill to gain</l>
       <l n="65">A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake 65</l>
       <l n="66">That knew not of his wants . I will not say</l>
       <l n="67">What thoughts immediately were ours , nor how</l>
       <l n="68">The happy idleness of that sweet morn ,</l>
       <l n="69">With all its lovely images , was changed</l>
       <l n="70">To serious musing and to self-reproach . 70</l>
       <l n="71">Nor did we fail to see within ourselves</l>
       <l n="72">What need there is to be reserved in speech ,</l>
       <l n="73">And temper all our thoughts with charity .</l>
       <l n="74">— Therefore , unwilling to forget that day ,</l>
       <l n="75">My Friend , Myself , and She who then received 75</l>
       <l n="76">The same admonishment , have called the place</l>

     <p>The text of this poem reached its final state in the edition of 1827 . The same is true of the poem which follows , ‘ To M. H . ’ , with the exception of a single change .</p>
     <p>In Wordsworth 's early days at Grasmere , a wild woodland path of quiet beauty led from Dove Cottage along the margin of the lake to the “ Point ” referred to in this poem , leaving the eastern shore truly “ safe in its own privacy ” — a “ retired and difficult way ” ; the high-way road for carriages being at that time over White Moss Common . The late Dr. Arnold , of Rugby and Foxhowe , used to name the three roads from Rydal to Grasmere thus : the highest , “ Old Corruption ” ; the intermediate , “ Bit by bit Reform ” ; the lowest and most level , “ Radical Reform . ” Wordsworth was never quite reconciled to the radical reform effected on a road that used to be so delightfully wild and picturesque . The spot which the three friends rather infelicitously named “ Point Rash-Judgment ” is easily identified ; although , as Wordsworth remarks , the character of the shore is changed by the public road being carried along its side . The friends were quite aware that the “ memorial name ” they gave it was “ uncouth . ” In spite of its awkwardness , however , it will probably survive ; if not for Browning 's reason</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ The better the uncouther ;</l>
       <l n="2">Do roses stick like burrs ? ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>at least because of the incident which gave rise to the poem . The date of composition is fixed by Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal ,</p>
     <p>“ 10th Oct. 1800 , Wm . sat up after me , writing ‘ Point Rash-Judgment . ’ ”</p>

     <p>To find the pool referred to in the Fenwick note , I have carefully examined the course of Rydal beck , all the way up to the foot of the Fell . There is a pool beyond the enclosures of the Hall property , about five hundred feet above Rydal Mount , which partly corresponds to the description in the poem , but there is no wood around it now ; and the trees which skirt its margin are birch , ash , oak , and hazel , but there are no beeches . It is a short way below some fine specimens of ice-worn rocks , which are to the right of the stream as you ascend it , and above these rocks is a well-marked moraine . It is a deep crystal pool , and has a “ firm margin ” of ( artificially placed ) stones . This may be the spot described in the poem ; or another , within the grounds of the Hall , may be the place referred to . It is a sequestered nook , beside the third waterfall as you ascend the beck — this third cascade being itself a treble fall . Seen two or three days after rain , when the stream is full enough to break over the whole face of the rock in showers of snowy brightness , yet low enough to shew the rock behind its transparent veil , it is specially beautiful . Trees change so much in eighty years that the absence of “ beeches ” now would not make this site impossible . In a MS. copy of the poem ( of date Dec. 28 , 1800 ) , the last line is</p>
     <p>‘ With all its poplars , we have named from you . ’</p>
     <p>Of the circular pool beneath this fall it may be said , as Wordsworth describes it , that</p>
     <p>‘ ... both flocks and herds might drink On its firm margin , even as from a well ; ’</p>
     <p>and a “ small slip of lawn ” might easily have existed there in his time . We cannot , however , be confident as to the locality , and I add the opinion of several , whose judgment may be deferred to . Dr. Cradock writes :</p>
     <p>“ As to Mary Hutchinson 's pool , I think that it was not on the beck anywhere , but some detached little pool , far up the hill , to the eastwards of the Hall , in ‘ the woods . ’ The description does not well suit any part of Rydal beck ; and no spot thereon could long ‘ remain unknown , ’ as the brook was until lately much haunted by anglers . ”</p>
     <p>My difficulty as to a site “ far up the hill ” is , that it must have been a pool of some size , if “ both flocks and herds might drink ” all round it ; and there is no stream , scarce even a rill that joins Rydal beck on the right , all the way up from its junction with the Rothay . The late Mr . Hull of Rydal Cottage , wrote :</p>
     <p>“ Although closely acquainted with every nook about Rydal Park , I have never been able to discover any spot corresponding to that described in Wordsworth 's lines to M. H. It is possible , however , that the ‘ small bed of water ’ may have been a temporary rain pool , such as sometimes lodges in the hollows on the mountain-slope after heavy rain . ”</p>
     <p>Mr. F. M. Jones , the agent of the Rydal property , writes :</p>
     <p>“ I do not know of any pool of water in the Upper Rydal Park . There are some pools up the river , ‘ Mirror Pool ’ among them ; but I hardly think there can ever have been ‘ beech-trees ’ growing near them . ”</p>

     <p>The spot referred to in this poem can be identified with perfect accuracy . The Eglantine grew on the little brook that runs past two cottages ( close to the path under Nab Scar ) , which have been built since the poet 's time , and are marked Brockstone on the Ordnance Map .</p>
     <p>“ The plant itself of course has long disappeared : but in following up the rill through the copse , above the cottages , I found an unusually large Eglantine , growing by the side of the stream . ”</p>
     <p>( Dr Cradock to the editor , in 1877 . ) It still grows luxuriantly there .</p>
     <p>The following extract from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal illustrates both this and the next poem :</p>
     <p>“ Friday , 23rd April 1802 .— It being a beautiful morning , we set off at eleven o'clock , intending to stay out of doors all the morning . We went towards Rydal , under Nab Scar . The sun shone and we were lazy . Coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down upon ; but we could not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade , so we pushed on to the foot of the Scar . It was very grand when we looked up , very stony ; here and there a budding tree . William observed that the umbrella Yew-tree that breasts the wind had lost its character as a tree , and had become like solid wood . Coleridge and I pushed on before . We left William sitting on the stones , feasting with silence , and I sat down upon a rocky seat , a couch it might be , under the Bower of William 's ‘ Eglantine , ’ ‘ Andrew 's Broom . ’ He was below us , and we could see him . He came to us , and repeated his Poems , while we sat beside him . We lingered long , looking into the vales ; Ambleside Vale , with the copses , the village under the hill , and the green fields ; Rydale , with a lake all alive and glittering , yet but little stirred by breezes ; and our own dear Grasmere , making a little round lake of Nature 's own , with never a house , never a green field , but the copses and the bare hills enclosing it , and the river flowing out of it . Above rose the Coniston Fells , in their own shape and colour , ... the sky , and the clouds , and a few wild creatures . Coleridge went to search for something new . We saw him climbing up towards a rock . He called us , and we found him in a bower ,— the sweetest that was ever seen . The rock on one side is very high , and all covered with ivy , which hung loosely about , and bore bunches of brown berries . On the other side , it was higher than my head . We looked down on the Ambleside vale , that seemed to wind away from us , the village lying under the hill . The fir tree island was reflected beautifully .... About this bower there is mountain-ash , common ash , yew tree , ivy , holly , hawthorn , roses , flowers , and a carpet of moss . Above at the top of the rock there is another spot . It is scarce a bower , a little parlour , not enclosed by walls , but shaped out for a resting-place by the rocks , and the ground rising about it . It had a sweet moss carpet . We resolved to go and plant flowers , in both these places to-morrow . ”</p>

       <l n="16">To Jane , his wife ,</l>
       <l n="17">Thus spake the homely Priest of Ennerdale .</l>
       <l n="18">It was a July evening ; and he sate</l>
       <l n="19">Upon the long stone-seat beneath the eaves</l>
       <l n="20">Of his old cottage ,— as it chanced , that day , 20</l>
       <l n="21">Employed in winter 's work . Upon the stone</l>
       <l n="22">His wife sate near him , teasing matted wool ,</l>
       <l n="23">While , from the twin cards toothed with glittering wire ,</l>
       <l n="24">He fed the spindle of his youngest child ,</l>
       <l n="25">Who , in the open air , with due accord 25</l>
       <l n="26">Of busy hands and back-and-forward steps ,</l>
       <l n="27">Her large round wheel was turning .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>Towards the field</l>
       <l n="28">In which the Parish Chapel stood alone ,</l>
       <l n="29">Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall ,</l>
       <l n="30">While half an hour went by , the Priest had sent 30</l>
       <l n="31">Many a long look of wonder : and at last ,</l>
       <l n="32">Risen from his seat , beside the snow white ridge</l>
       <l n="33">Of carded wool which the old man had piled</l>
       <l n="34">He laid his implements with gentle care ,</l>
       <l n="35">Each in the other locked ; and , down the path 35</l>
       <l n="36">That<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>from his cottage to the church-yard led ,</l>
       <l n="37">He took his way , impatient to accost</l>

       <l n="39">‘ Twas one well known to him in former days ,</l>

       <l n="41">Had left that calling , tempted to entrust</l>

       <l n="43">And perilous waters ; with the mariners<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>

       <l n="45">Through twenty seasons ; but he had been reared 45</l>
       <l n="46">Among the mountains , and he in his heart</l>
       <l n="47">Was half a shepherd on the stormy seas .</l>
       <l n="48">Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard</l>
       <l n="49">The tones of waterfalls , and inland sounds</l>
       <l n="50">Of caves and trees :— and , when the regular wind 50</l>
       <l n="51">Between the tropics filled the steady sail ,</l>
       <l n="52">And blew with the same breath through days and weeks ,</l>
       <l n="53">Lengthening invisibly its weary line</l>
       <l n="54">Along the cloudless Main , he , in those hours</l>
       <l n="55">Of tiresome indolence , would often hang 55</l>
       <l n="56">Over the vessel 's side , and gaze and gaze ;</l>
       <l n="57">And , while the broad blue<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>wave and sparkling foam</l>
       <l n="58">Flashed round him images and hues that wrought</l>

       <l n="62">Below him , in the bosom of the deep ,</l>
       <l n="63">Saw mountains ; saw the forms of sheep that grazed</l>
       <l n="64">On verdant hills — with dwellings among trees ,</l>
       <l n="65">And shepherds clad in the same country grey 65</l>

       <l n="70">To his paternal home he is returned , 70</l>
       <l n="71">With a determined purpose to resume</l>
       <l n="72">The life he had lived there ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>both for the sake</l>

       <l n="82">He to the solitary church-yard turned ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span></l>

       <l n="91">That he had seen this heap of turf before ,—</l>
       <l n="92">That it was not another grave ; but one</l>
       <l n="93">He had forgotten . He had lost his path ,</l>
       <l n="94">As up the vale , that afternoon , he walked<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span></l>
       <l n="95">Through fields which once had been well known to him : 95</l>
       <l n="96">And oh what joy this<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>recollection now</l>
       <l n="97">Sent to his heart ! he lifted up his eyes ,</l>

       <l n="99">Strange alteration wrought on every side</l>
       <l n="100">Among the woods and fields , and that the rocks , 100</l>

       <l n="106">Ay , thought the Vicar , smiling to himself ,</l>

     <p>This poem illustrates the way in which Wordsworth 's imagination worked upon a minimum of fact , idealizing a simple story , and adding</p>
     <p>‘ the gleam , The light that never was , on sea or land , The consecration , and the Poet 's dream . ’</p>
     <p>It is the only poem of his referring to Ennerdale ; but perhaps the chief association with that dale , to those who visit it after becoming acquainted with this poem , will be the fact that the brothers Ewbank were supposed to have spent their youth under the shadow of the Pillar , and Leonard to have had this conversation , on his return from sea , with the venerable priest of Ennerdale . The district is described with all that local accuracy which Wordsworth invariably showed in idealization . The height whence James Ewbank is supposed to have fallen is not the Pillar-Rock — a crag somewhat difficult to ascend , except by practised climbers , and which has only been accessible since mountaineering became an art and a passion to Englishmen . But , if we suppose the conversation with the priest of Ennerdale to have taken place at the Bridge , below the Lake — as that is the only place where there is both a hamlet and “ a churchyard ” — the “ precipice ” will refer to the Pillar “ Mountain . ” Both are alluded to in the poem . The lines ,</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ You see yon precipice ;— it wears the shape</l>
       <l n="2">Of a vast building made of many crags ;</l>
       <l n="3">And in the midst is one particular rock</l>
       <l n="4">That rises like a column from the vale ,</l>
       <l n="5">Whence by our shepherds it is called , The Pillar , ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>are definite enough . The great mass of the Pillar Mountain is first referred to , and then the Rock which is a characteristic spur , halfway up the mountain on its northern side . The “ aëry summit crowned with heath , ” however , on which “ the loiterer ” “ lay stretched at ease , ” could neither be the top of this “ rock ” nor the summit of the “ mountain ": not the former , because there is no heath on it , and it would be impossible for a weary man , loitering behind his companions , to ascend it to rest ; not the latter , because no one resting on the summit of the mountain could be “ not unnoticed by his comrades , ” and they would not pass that way over the top of the mountain “ on their return ” to Ennerdale . This is an instance , therefore , in which precise localization is impossible . Probably Wordsworth did not know either that the pillar “ rock ” was bare on the summit , or that it had never been ascended in 1800 ; and he idealised it to suit his imaginative purpose . In connection with this poem , a remark he made to the Hon . Mr. Justice Coleridge may be recalled .</p>
     <p>“ He said there was some foundation in fact , however slight , for every poem he had written of a narrative kind ; ... ‘ The Brothers ’ was founded on a young shepherd , in his sleep , having fallen down a crag , his staff remaining suspended mid-way . ”</p>
     <p>( See the ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ , by the late Bishop of Lincoln , vol . ii . p . 305 . ) It should be added that the character of Leonard Ewbank was drawn in large part from that of the poet 's brother John — Ed .</p>

     <p>The “ shapeless heap of stones ” in St. Herbert 's Island , which were “ desolate ruins ” in 1800 , are even more “ shapeless ” and “ desolate ” now , but they can easily be identified . The island is near the centre of the lake , and is in area about four acres . The legend of St. Herbert dates from the middle of the seventh century . The rector of Clifton , Westmoreland , Dr. Robinson , writing in 1819 , says :</p>
     <p>“ The remains of his hermitage are still visible , being built of stone and mortar , and formed into two apartments , one of which , about twenty feet long and sixteen feet wide , seems to have been his chapel ; the other , of less dimensions , his cell . Near these ruins the late Sir Wilfred Lawson ( to whose representative the island at present belongs ) erected some years ago a small octagonal cottage , which , being built of unhewn stone , and artificially mossed over , has a venerable appearance . ”</p>
     <p>( See Guide to the Lakes , by John Robinson , D. D ., 1819 ) . This cottage has now disappeared . The following version of this “ Inscription ” occurs in a letter from Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont , dated 26th November 1811 :</p>

     <note>Written at the Town-end , Grasmere , about the same time as ‘ The Brothers ’ . The sheepfold , on which so much of the poem turns , remains , or rather the ruins of it . The character and circumstances of Luke were taken from a family to whom had belonged , many years before , the house we lived in at Town-end , along with some fields and woodlands on the eastern shore of Grasmere . The name of the Evening Star was not in fact given to this house , but to another on the same side of the valley , more to the north .— I. F .</note>

       <l n="1">If from the public way you turn your steps</l>
       <l n="2">Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll ,</l>
       <l n="3">You will suppose that with an upright path</l>
       <l n="4">Your feet must struggle ; in such bold ascent</l>
       <l n="5">The pastoral mountains front you , face to face . 5</l>
       <l n="6">But , courage ! for around<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>that boisterous brook</l>
       <l n="7">The mountains have all opened out themselves ,</l>
       <l n="8">And made a hidden valley of their own .</l>
       <l n="9">No habitation can be seen ; but they</l>
       <l n="10">Who journey thither find themselves alone<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>10</l>
       <l n="11">With a few sheep , with rocks and stones , and kites</l>

       <l n="13">It is in truth an utter solitude ;</l>
       <l n="14">Nor should I have made mention of this Dell</l>
       <l n="15">But for one object which you might pass by , 15</l>

       <l n="17">Appears<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>a straggling heap of unhewn stones !</l>
       <l n="18">And to that simple object appertains</l>
       <l n="19">A story — unenriched with strange events ,</l>
       <l n="20">Yet not unfit , I deem , for the fireside ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>20</l>
       <l n="21">Or for the summer shade . It was the first</l>
       <l n="22">Of those domestic tales that spake to me<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span></l>
       <l n="23">Of Shepherds , dwellers in the valleys , men</l>

       <l n="27">And hence this Tale , while I was yet a Boy</l>
       <l n="28">Careless of books , yet having felt the power</l>
       <l n="29">Of Nature , by the gentle agency</l>
       <l n="30">Of natural objects , led me on to feel 30</l>

       <l n="35">Homely and rude , I will relate the same 35</l>
       <l n="36">For the delight of a few natural hearts ;</l>
       <l n="37">And , with yet fonder feeling , for the sake</l>

       <l n="40">Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale 40</l>
       <l n="41">There dwelt a Shepherd , Michael was his name ;</l>
       <l n="42">An old man , stout of heart , and strong of limb .</l>
       <l n="43">His bodily frame had been from youth to age</l>
       <l n="44">Of an unusual strength : his mind was keen ,</l>
       <l n="45">Intense , and frugal , apt for all affairs , 45</l>
       <l n="46">And in his shepherd 's calling he was prompt</l>
       <l n="47">And watchful more than ordinary men .</l>
       <l n="48">Hence had he learned<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>the meaning of all winds ,</l>
       <l n="49">Of blasts of every tone ; and , oftentimes ,</l>
       <l n="50">When others heeded not , He heard the South 50</l>
       <l n="51">Make subterraneous music , like the noise</l>
       <l n="52">Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills .</l>
       <l n="53">The Shepherd , at such warning , of his flock</l>
       <l n="54">Bethought him , and he to himself would say ,</l>
       <l n="55">“ The winds are now devising work for me ! ” 55</l>
       <l n="56">And , truly , at all times , the storm , that drives</l>
       <l n="57">The traveller to a shelter , summoned him</l>
       <l n="58">Up to the mountains : he had been alone</l>
       <l n="59">Amid the heart of many thousand mists ,</l>
       <l n="60">That came to him , and left him , on the heights . 60</l>
       <l n="61">So lived he till his eightieth year was past .</l>
       <l n="62">And grossly that man errs , who should suppose</l>
       <l n="63">That the green valleys , and the streams and rocks ,</l>
       <l n="64">Were things indifferent to the Shepherd 's thoughts .</l>
       <l n="65">Fields , where with cheerful spirits he had breathed 65</l>
       <l n="66">The common air ; hills , which with vigorous step</l>
       <l n="67">He had so often climbed ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>which had impressed</l>
       <l n="68">So many incidents upon his mind</l>
       <l n="69">Of hardship , skill or courage , joy or fear ;</l>
       <l n="70">Which , like a book , preserved the memory 70</l>
       <l n="71">Of the dumb animals , whom he had saved ,</l>
       <l n="72">Had fed or sheltered , linking to such acts</l>
       <l n="73">The certainty of honourable gain ;</l>
       <l n="74">Those fields , those hills — what could they less ? had laid<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></l>
       <l n="75">Strong hold on his affections , were to him 75</l>
       <l n="76">A pleasurable feeling of blind love ,</l>
       <l n="77">The pleasure which there is in life itself .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="78">His days had not been passed in singleness .</l>
       <l n="79">His Helpmate was a comely matron , old —<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span></l>
       <l n="80">Though younger than himself full twenty years . 80</l>
       <l n="81">She was a woman of a stirring life ,</l>
       <l n="82">Whose heart was in her house : two wheels she had</l>
       <l n="83">Of antique form ; this large , for spinning wool ;</l>
       <l n="84">That small , for flax ; and if one wheel had rest ,</l>
       <l n="85">It was because the other was at work . 85</l>
       <l n="86">The Pair had but one inmate in their house ,</l>
       <l n="87">An only Child , who had been born to them</l>
       <l n="88">When Michael , telling o'er his years , began</l>
       <l n="89">To deem that he was old ,— in shepherd 's phrase ,</l>
       <l n="90">With one foot in the grave . This only Son , 90</l>
       <l n="91">With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm ,</l>
       <l n="92">The one of an inestimable worth ,</l>
       <l n="93">Made all their household . I may truly say ,</l>
       <l n="94">That they were as a proverb in the vale</l>
       <l n="95">For endless industry . When day was gone , 95</l>
       <l n="96">And from their occupations out of doors</l>
       <l n="97">The Son and Father were come home , even then ,</l>
       <l n="98">Their labour did not cease ; unless when all</l>
       <l n="99">Turned to the<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>cleanly supper-board , and there ,</l>
       <l n="100">Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk , 100</l>
       <l n="101">Sat round the<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>basket piled with oaten cakes ,</l>
       <l n="102">And their plain home-made cheese . Yet when the<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>meal</l>
       <l n="103">Was ended , Luke ( for so the Son was named )</l>
       <l n="104">And his old Father both betook themselves</l>
       <l n="105">To such convenient work as might employ 105</l>
       <l n="106">Their hands by the fire-side ; perhaps to card</l>
       <l n="107">Wool for the Housewife 's spindle , or repair</l>
       <l n="108">Some injury done to sickle , flail , or scythe ,</l>

     <p>“ Hugil , a chapelry six and a quarter miles from Kendal . The chapel , rebuilt in 1743 by Robert Bateman , stands in the village of Ings , which is in this chapelry . The free school was endowed with land in 1650 by Roland Wilson , producing at present £ 12 per annum . The average number of boys is twenty-five . This endowment was augmented by £ 8 per annum by Robert Bateman , who gave £ 1000 for purchasing an estate , and erected eight alms-houses for as many poor families , besides a donation of £ 12 per annum to the curate . This worthy benefactor was born here , and from a state of indigence succeeded in amassing considerable wealth by mercantile pursuits . He is stated to have been poisoned , in the straits of Gibraltar , on his voyage from Leghorn , with a valuable cargo , by the captain of the vessel , ”</p>

     <p>From the Fenwick note it will be seen that Michael 's sheep-fold , in Green-head Ghyll , existed — at least the remains of it — in 1843 . Its site , however , is now very difficult to identify . There is a sheep-fold above Boon Beck , which one passes immediately on entering the common , going up Green-head Ghyll . It is now “ finished , ” and used when required . There are remains of walling , much higher up the ghyll ; but these are probably the work of miners , formerly engaged there . Michael 's cottage had been destroyed when the poem was written , in 1800 . It stood where the coach-house and stables of “ the Hollins ” now stand . But one who visits Green-head Ghyll , and wishes to realize Michael in his old age — as described in this poem — should ascend the ghyll till it almost reaches the top of Fairfield ; where the old man , during eighty years ,</p>
     <p>‘ had learned the meaning of all winds , Of blasts of every tone , ’</p>
     <p>and where he</p>
     <p>‘ had been alone , Amid the heart of many thousand mists , That came to him , and left him , on the heights . ’</p>
     <p>By so doing he will be better able to realize the spirit of the poem , than by trying to identify the site either of the “ unfinished sheep-fold , ” or of the house named the “ Evening Star . ” What Wordsworth said to the Hon . Mr. Justice Coleridge in reference to ‘ The Brothers ’ has been quoted in the note to that poem , p. 203 . On the same occasion he remarked , in reference to ‘ Michael ':</p>
     <p>“ ‘ Michael ’ was founded on the son of an old couple having become dissolute , and run away from his parents ; and on an old shepherd having been seven years in building up a sheep-fold in a solitary valley . ”</p>
     <p>( ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ , by the late Bishop of Lincoln , vol . ii . p . 305 . )</p>
     <p>The following extracts from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Grasmere Journal , show the carefulness with which the poem ‘ Michael ’ was composed , and the frequent revisions which it underwent :</p>
     <p>‘ Oct. 11 [ 1800 . ] “ We walked up Green-head ghyll in search of a sheepfold .... The sheepfold is falling away . It is built nearly in the form of a heart unequally divided . ”</p>
     <p>13 . “ William composing in the evening . ”</p>
     <p>15 . “ W. composed a little . ” ... “ W. again composed at the sheepfold after dinner . ”</p>
     <p>18 . “ W. worked all the morning at the sheepfold , but in vain . He lay down till 7 o'clock , but did not sleep . ”</p>
     <p>19 . “ William got to work . ”</p>
     <p>20 . “ W. worked in the morning at the sheepfold . ”</p>
     <p>21 . “ W. had been unsuccessful in the morning at the sheepfold . ”</p>
     <p>22 . “ W. composed , without much success , at the sheepfold . ”</p>
     <p>23 . “ W. was not successful in composition in the evening . ”</p>
     <p>24 . “ W. was only partly successful in composition . ”</p>
     <p>26 . “ W. composed a good deal all the morning . ”</p>
     <p>28 . “ W. could not compose much ; fatigued himself with altering . ”</p>
     <p>30 . “ W. worked at his poem all the morning . ”</p>
     <p>Nov. 10 . “ W. at the sheepfold . ”</p>
     <p>12 . “ W. has been working at the sheepfold . ”</p>
     <p>Dec. 9 . “ W. finished his poem to-day . " ’</p>
     <p>It is impossible to say with certainty that the entry under Dec. 9 refers to ‘ Michael ’ , but if it does , it is evident that Wordsworth wrought continuously at this poem for nearly two months .</p>
     <p>On April 9 , 1801 , Wordsworth wrote to Thomas Poole :</p>
     <p>“ In writing it ” ( ‘ Michael ’ ) , “ I had your character often before my eyes ; and sometimes thought that I was delineating such a man as you yourself would have been , under the same circumstances . ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The following is part of a letter written by Wordsworth to Charles James</l>
       <l n="2">Fox in 1802 , and sent with a copy of “ Lyrical Ballads ":</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ In the two poems , ‘ The Brothers ’ and ‘ Michael ’ , I have attempted to draw a picture of the domestic affections , as I know they exist amongst a class of men who are now almost confined to the north of England . They are small independent ‘ proprietors ’ of land , here called ‘ statesmen , ’ men of respectable education , who daily labour on their own little properties . The domestic affections will always be strong amongst men who live in a country not crowded with population ; if these men are placed above poverty . But , if they are proprietors of small estates which have descended to them from their ancestors , the power which these affections will acquire amongst such men , is inconceivable by those who have only had an opportunity of observing hired labourers , farmers , and the manufacturing poor . Their little tract of land serves as a kind of permanent rallying point for their domestic feelings , as a tablet on which they are written , which makes them objects of memory in a thousand instances , when they would otherwise be forgotten . It is a fountain fitted to the nature of social man , from which supplies of affection as pure as his heart was intended for , are daily drawn . This class of men is rapidly disappearing .... The two poems that I have mentioned were written with a view to show that men who do not wear fine clothes can feel deeply . ‘ Pectus enim est quod disertos facit , et vis mentis . Ideoque imperitis quoque , si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati , verba non desunt . ’ The poems are faithful copies from nature ; and I hope whatever effect they may have upon you , you will at least be able to perceive that they may excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts ; and may in some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species , and our knowledge of human nature , by showing that our best qualities are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider , not with reference to the points in which they resemble us , but to those in which they manifestly differ from us . ” ( See ‘ Correspondence of Sir Thomas Hanmer ’ , by Sir Henry Burnbury , p . 436 . )</p>
     <p>A number of fragments , originally meant to be parts of ‘ Michael ’ ,— or at least written with such a possibility in view ,— will be found in the Appendix to the eighth volume of this edition .— Ed .</p>
     <p>1801</p>
     <p>‘ The Sparrow 's Nest ’ , and the sonnet on Skiddaw , along with some translations from Chaucer , belong to the year 1801 . During this year , however , ‘ The Excursion ’ was in progress . In its earlier stages , and before the plan of ‘ The Recluse ’ was matured , the introductory part was familiarly known , and talked of in the Wordsworth household , by the name of “ The Pedlar . ” The following extracts from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal of 1801 will show the progress that was being made with it :</p>
     <p>“ Dec . 21 .— Wm . sate beside me , and wrote ‘ The Pedlar . ’ 22nd .— W . composed a few lines of ‘ The Pedlar . ’ 23rd .— William worked at ‘ The Ruined Cottage ’ ” ( this was the name of the first part of ‘ The Excursion ’ , in which ‘ The Pedlar ’ was included ) , “ and made himself very ill , ” etc .</p>

     <p>SELECTIONS FROM CHAUCER</p>
     <p>MODERNISED</p>
     <p>Wordsworth 's modernisations of Chaucer were all written in 1801 . Two of them were from the Canterbury Tales , but his version of one of these — ‘ The Manciple 's Tale ’ — has never been printed . Of the three poems which were published , the first — ‘ The Prioress ’ Tale ’ — was included in the edition of 1820 . The ‘ Troilus and Cressida ’ and ‘ The Cuckoo and the Nightingale ’ were included in the “ Poems of Early and Late Years ” ( 1842 ) ; but they had been published the year before , in a small volume entitled ‘ The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer Modernised ’ ( London , 1841 ) , a volume to which Elizabeth Barrett , Leigh Hunt , R. H. Home , Thomas Powell , and others contributed . Wordsworth wrote thus of the project to Mr. Powell , in an unpublished and undated letter , written probably in 1840 :</p>
     <p>“ I am glad that you enter so warmly into the Chaucerian project , and that Mr. L. Hunt is disposed to give his valuable aid to it . For myself , I cannot do more than I offered , to place at your disposal ‘ The Prioress ’ Tale ’ already published , ‘ The Cuckoo and the Nightingale ’ , ‘ The Manciple 's Tale ’ , and I rather think ( but I cannot just now find it ) a small portion of the ‘ Troilus and Cressida ’ . You ask my opinion about that poem . Speaking from a recollection only , of many years past , I should say it would be found too long and probably tedious . ‘ The Knight 's Tale ’ is also very long ; but , though Dryden has executed it , in his own way observe , with great spirit and harmony , he has suffered so much of the simplicity , and with that of the beauty and occasional pathos of the original to escape , that I should be pleased to hear that a new version was to be attempted upon my principle by some competent person . It would delight me to read every part of Chaucer over again — for I reverence and admire him above measure — with a view to your work ; but my eyes will not permit me to do so . Who will undertake the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales ? For your publication that is indispensable , and I fear it will prove very difficult . It is written , as you know , in the couplet measure ; and therefore I have nothing to say upon its metre , but in respect to the poems in stanza , neither in ‘ The Prioress ’ Tale ’ nor in ‘ The Cuckoo and Nightingale ’ have I kept to the rule of the original as to the form , and number , and position of the rhymes ; thinking it enough if I kept the same number of lines in each stanza ; and this is , I think , all that is necessary , and all that can be done without sacrificing the substance of sense too often to the mere form of sound . ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">In a subsequent letter to Professor Henry Reed of Philadelphia , dated</l>
       <l n="2">“ Rydal Mount , January 13th , 1841 , ” Wordsworth said :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ So great is my admiration of Chaucer 's genius , and so profound my reverence for him as an instrument in the hands of Providence , for spreading the light of literature through his native land , that notwithstanding the defects and faults in this publication ” ( referring , I presume , to the volume , ‘ The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer Modernised ’ ) , “ I am glad of it , as a means of making many acquainted with the original , who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about him but his name . ”</p>

     <p>In the following Piece I have allowed myself no farther deviations from the original than were necessary for the fluent reading , and instant understanding , of the Author : so much however is the language altered since Chaucer 's time , especially in pronunciation , that much was to be removed , and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible . The ancient accent has been retained in a few conjunctions , such as also and alway , from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity would be admitted , by persons of taste , to have a graceful accordance with the subject .— W . W. ( 1820 ) .</p>
     <p>The fierce bigotry of the Prioress forms a fine back ground for her tender-hearted sympathies with the Mother and Child ; and the mode in which the story is told amply atones for the extravagance of the miracle .— W . W. ( added in 1827 ) .</p>
     <p>In the editions of 1820 and 1827 ‘ The Prioress ’ Tale ’ followed ‘ The White Doe of Rylstone ’ . In 1832 it followed the “ Inscriptions ” ; and in 1836 it was included among the “ Poems founded on the Affections . ” In 1845 it found its appropriate place in the “ Selections from Chaucer modernised . ” — Ed .</p>

     <p>The Lyrical Ballads and Sonnets which follow were written in 1802 ; but during that year Wordsworth continued mainly to work at ‘ The Excursion ’ , as the following extracts from his sister 's Journal indicate :</p>
     <p>“ Feb. 1 , 1802 .— William worked hard at ‘ The Pedlar , ’ and tired himself .</p>
     <p>2nd Feb .— Wm . worked at ‘ The Pedlar . ’ I read aloud the 11th book of ‘ Paradise Lost ’ .</p>
     <p>Thursday , 4th .— William thought a little about ‘ The Pedlar . ’</p>

      <head>ALICE FELL ; OR , POVERTY [ A ]</head>
       <l n="1">Composed March 12th and 13th , 1802 .— Published 1807</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Written to gratify Mr. Graham of Glasgow , brother of the author of ‘ The Sabbath ’ . He was a zealous coadjutor of Mr. Clarkson , and a man of ardent humanity . The incident had happened to himself , and he urged me to put it into verse , for humanity 's sake . The humbleness , meanness if you like , of the subject , together with the homely mode of treating it , brought upon me a world of ridicule by the small critics , so that in policy I excluded it from many editions of my poems , till it was restored at the request of some of my friends , in particular my son-in-law , Edward Quillinan .— I. F .</note>
     <p>It was only excluded from the editions of 1820 , 1827 , and 1832 . In the edition of 1807 it was placed amongst a group of “ Poems composed during a Tour , chiefly on foot . ” In 1815 , in 1836 , and afterwards , it was included in the group “ referring to the Period of Childhood . ”</p>
     <p>In Dorothy Wordsworth 's Grasmere Journal , the following reference to this poem occurs :</p>
     <p>“ Feb. 16 , 1802 .— Mr . Graham said he wished William had been with him the other day . He was riding in a post-chaise , and he heard a strange cry that he could not understand . The sound continued , and he called to the chaise-driver to stop . It was a little girl that was crying as if her heart would burst . She had got up behind the chaise , and her cloak had been caught by the wheel , and was jammed in , and it hung there . She was crying after it , poor thing . Mr. Graham took her into the chaise , and her cloak was released from the wheel , but the child 's misery did not cease , for her cloak was torn to rags . It had been a miserable cloak before ; but she had no other , and it was the greatest sorrow that could befall her . Her name was Alice Fell . She had no parents , and belonged to the next town . At the next town Mr. G. left money to buy her a new cloak . ”</p>

     <p>“ Saturday ( March 13 , 1802 ) .— William wrote the poem of the Beggar Woman , taken from a woman whom I had seen in May ( now nearly two years ago ) , when John and he were at Gallow Hill . I sat with him at intervals all the morning , and took down his stanzas . After tea I read W. the account I had written of the little boy belonging to the tall woman : and an unlucky thing it was , for he could not escape from those very words , and so he could not write the poem . He left it unfinished , and went tired to bed . In our walk from Rydal he had got warmed with the subject , and had half cast the poem . ”</p>
     <p>“ Sunday Morning ( March 14 ) .— William had slept badly . He got up at 9 o'clock , but before he rose he had finished the Beggar Boy . ”</p>
     <p>The following is the “ account ” written in her Journal on Tuesday , May 23 , 1800 :</p>
     <p>“ A very tall woman , tall much beyond the measure of tall women , called at the door . She had on a very long brown cloak , and a very white cap , without bonnet . Her face was brown , but it had plainly once been fair . She led a little barefooted child about two years old by the hand , and said her husband , who was a tinker , was gone before with the other children . I gave her a piece of bread . Afterwards , on my road to Ambleside , beside the bridge at Rydal , I saw her husband sitting at the roadside , his two asses standing beside him , and the two young children at play upon the grass . The man did not beg . I passed on , and about a quarter of a mile farther I saw two boys before me , one about ten , the other about eight years old , at play , chasing a butterfly . They were wild figures , not very ragged , but without shoes and stockings . The hat of the elder was wreathed round with yellow flowers ; the younger , whose hat was only a rimless crown , had stuck it round with laurel leaves . They continued at play till I drew very near , and then they addressed me with the begging cant and the whining voice of sorrow . I said , ‘ I served your mother this morning ’ ( the boys were so like the woman who had called at our door that I could not be mistaken ) . ‘ O , ’ says the elder , ‘ you could not serve my mother , for she 's dead , and my father 's in at the next town ; he 's a potter . ’ I persisted in my assertion , and that I would give them nothing . Says the elder , ‘ Come , let 's away , ’ and away they flew like lightning . They had , however , sauntered so long in their road that they did not reach Ambleside before me , and I saw them go up to Mathew Harrison 's house with their wallet upon the elder 's shoulder , and creeping with a beggar 's complaining foot . On my return through Ambleside I met , in the street , the mother driving her asses , in the two panniers of one of which were the two little children , whom she was chiding and threatening with a wand with which she used to drive on her asses , while the little things hung in wantonness over the pannier 's edge . The woman had told me in the morning that she was of Scotland , which her accent fully proved , and that she had lived ( I think at Wigtown ) ; that they could not keep a house , and so they travelled . ”</p>

     <p>The text of this poem was never changed . It refers to days of childhood spent at Cockermouth before 1778 . “ My sister Emmeline ” is Dorothy Wordsworth . In her Grasmere Journal , of Sunday , March 14 , 1802 , the following occurs :</p>
     <p>“ While we were at breakfast he ” ( William ) “ wrote the poem ‘ To a Butterfly ’ . He ate not a morsel , but sate with his shirt neck unbuttoned , and his waistcoat open when he did it . The thought first came upon him as we were talking about the pleasure we both always felt at the sight of a butterfly . I told him that I used to chase them a little , but that I was afraid of brushing the dust off their wings , and did not catch them . He told me how he used to kill all the white ones when he went to school , because they were Frenchmen . Mr. Simpson came in just as he was finishing the poem . After he was gone , I wrote it down , and the other poems , and I read them all over to him .... William began to try to alter ‘ The Butterfly ’ , and tired himself . ”</p>
     <p>Compare the later poem ‘ To a Butterfly ’ (# 2 ) ( April 20 ) , p . 297 .— Ed .</p>

      <head>THE EMIGRANT MOTHER</head>
       <l n="1">Composed March 16th and 17th , 1802 .— Published 1807</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Suggested by what I have noticed in more than one French fugitive during the time of the French Revolution . If I am not mistaken the lines were composed at Sockburn when I was on a visit to Mary and her brothers .— I . F .</note>
     <p>In the editions of 1807 and 1815 , this poem had no distinctive title ; but in the Wordsworth circle , it was known from the year 1802 as ‘ The Emigrant Mother ’ , and at least one copy was transcribed with this title in 1802 . It was first published under that name in 1820 . It was revised and altered in 1820 , 1827 , 1832 , 1836 , and more especially in 1845 .</p>
     <p>In Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal the following entries occur :</p>
     <p>“ Tuesday ( March 16 ) .— William went up into the orchard , and wrote a part of ‘ The Emigrant Mother ’ . ”</p>
     <p>“ Wednesday .— William went up into the orchard , and finished the poem .... I went and sate with W ., and walked backwards and forwards in the orchard till dinner-time . He read me his poem . ”</p>

     <note>Sub-Footnote a : Barron Field remonstrated with Wordsworth about this reading , and he agreed to restore that of 1820 ; saying , at the same time , that he had “ made the change to record a fact observed by himself . ” — Ed .</note>
     <p>In the chronological lists of his poems , published in 1815 and 1820 , Wordsworth left a blank opposite this one , in the column containing the year of composition . From 1836 to 1849 , the date assigned by him was 1804 . But in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal the following occurs under date Tuesday , 22nd March 1802 :</p>
     <p>“ A mild morning . William worked at the Cuckoo poem .... At the closing in of day , went to sit in the orchard . William came to me , and walked backwards and forwards . W. repeated the poem to me . I left him there ; and in 20 minutes he came in , rather tired with attempting to write . ”</p>

       <l n="2">Cuckoo ’ . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>It is therefore evident that it belongs to the year 1802 ; although it may have been altered and readjusted in 1804 . The connection of the seventh stanza of this poem with the first of that which follows it , “ My heart leaps up , ” etc ., and of both with the ‘ Ode , Intimations of Immortality ’ ( vol . viii . ) , is obvious .— Ed .</p>

     <p>( Dorothy Wordsworth 's Grasmere Journal . ) This poem was known familiarly in the household as “ The Rainbow , ” although not printed under that title . The text was never changed .</p>
     <p>In ‘ The Friend ’ , vol . i. p. 58 ( ed . 1818 ) , Coleridge writes :</p>
     <p>“ Men laugh at the falsehoods imposed on them during their childhood , because they are not good and wise enough to contemplate the past in the present , and so to produce that continuity in their self-consciousness , which Nature has made the law of their animal life . Men are ungrateful to others , only when they have ceased to look back on their former selves with joy and tenderness . They exist in fragments . ”</p>
     <p>He then quotes the above poem , and adds :</p>
     <p>“ I am informed that these lines have been cited as a specimen of despicable puerility . So much the worse for the citer ; not willingly in his presence would I behold the sun setting behind our mountains .... But let the dead bury their dead ! The poet sang for the living .... I was always pleased with the motto placed under the figure of the rosemary in old herbals :</p>
     <p>‘ Sus , apage ! Haud tibi spiro . ’ ”</p>

     <p>The text of this poem was never altered . It was not “ written in March ” ( as the title states ) , but on the 16th of April ( Good Friday ) 1802 . The bridge referred to crosses Goldrill Beck , a little below Hartsop in Patterdale . The following , from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal , records the walk from Ullswater , over Kirkstone Pass , to Ambleside :</p>
     <p>“ Friday , 16th April ( Good Friday ) .—... When we came to the foot of Brothers Water , I left William sitting on the bridge , and went along the path on the right side of the lake through the wood . I was delighted with what I saw : the water under the boughs of the bare old trees , the simplicity of the mountains , and the exquisite beauty of the path . There was one grey cottage . I repeated ‘ The Glowworm ’ as I walked along . I hung over the gate , and thought I could have stayed for ever . When I returned , I found William writing a poem descriptive of the sights and sounds we saw and heard . There was the gentle flowing of the stream , the glittering lively lake , green fields , without a living creature to be seen on them ; behind us , a flat pasture with forty-two cattle feeding ; to our left , the road leading to the hamlet . No smoke there , the sun shone on the bare roofs . The people were at work , ploughing , harrowing , and sowing ; lasses working ; a dog barking now and then ; cocks crowing , birds twittering ; the snow in patches at the top of the highest hills ; yellow palms , purple and green twigs on the birches , ashes with their glittering stems quite bare . The hawthorn a bright green , with black stems under the oak . The moss of the oaks glossy .... As we went up the vale of Brothers Water , more and more cattle feeding , a hundred of them . William finished his poem before we got to the foot of Kirkstone . There were hundreds of cattle in the vale .... The walk up Kirkstone was very interesting . The becks among the rocks were all alive . William shewed me the little mossy streamlet which he had before loved , when he saw its bright green track in the snow . The view above Ambleside very beautiful . There we sate , and looked down on the green vale . We watched the crows at a little distance from us become white as silver , as they flew in the sunshine ; and , when they went still farther , they looked like shapes of water passing over the green fields . ”</p>

     <p>“ Wednesday , 28th April ( 1802 ) .— Copied the ‘ Prioress 's Tale ’ . William was in the orchard . I went to him ; he worked away at his poem , though he was ill , and tired . I happened to say that when I was a child I would not have pulled a strawberry blossom ; I left him , and wrote out the ‘ Manciple 's Tale ’ . At dinner time he came in with the poem of ‘ Children gathering Flowers , ’ but it was not quite finished , and it kept him long from his dinner . It is now done . He is working at ‘ The Tinker . ’ ”</p>
     <p>At an earlier date in the same year ,— Jan. 31st , 1802 ,— the following occurs :</p>
     <p>“ I found a strawberry blossom in a rock . The little slender flower had more courage than the green leaves , for they were but half expanded and half grown , but the blossom was spread full out . I uprooted it rashly , and I felt as if I had been committing an outrage ; so I planted it again . It will have but a stormy life of it , but let it live if it can . ”</p>

     <note>Written at Town-end , Grasmere . It is remarkable that this flower , coming out so early in the spring as it does , and so bright and beautiful , and in such profusion , should not have been noticed earlier in English verse . What adds much to the interest that attends it is its habit of shutting itself up and opening out according to the degree of light and temperature of the air .— I. F .</note>
     <p>One of the “ Poems of the Fancy . ” In the original MS. this poem is called ‘ To the lesser Celandine ’ , but in the proof “ small ” was substituted for “ lesser . ”</p>
     <p>In Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal the following occurs , under date April 30 , 1802 :</p>
     <p>“ We came into the orchard directly after breakfast , and sat there . The lake was calm , the sky cloudy . William began to write the poem of ‘ The Celandine ’ .... I walked backwards and forwards with William . He repeated his poem to me , then he got to work again , and would not give over . ”</p>

We then went and sat in the orchard till dinner time . It was very hot . William wrote ‘ The Celandine ’ ( second part ) . We planned a shed , for the sun was too much for us . ”</p>

       <l n="1">Within our happy Castle there dwelt One</l>
       <l n="2">Whom without blame I may not overlook ;</l>
       <l n="3">For never sun on living creature shone</l>
       <l n="4">Who more devout enjoyment with us took :</l>
       <l n="5">Here on his hours he hung as on a book , 5</l>
       <l n="6">On his own time here would he float away ,</l>

     <p>There can now be no doubt that , in the first four of these ‘ Stanzas ’ , Wordsworth refers to himself ; and that , in the last four , he refers to Coleridge . For a time it was uncertain whether in the earlier stanzas he had Coleridge , or himself , in view ; and whether , in the later ones , some one else was , or was not , described . De Quincey , quoting ( as he often did ) in random fashion , mixes up extracts from each set of the stanzas , and applies them both to Coleridge ; and Dorothy Wordsworth , in her Journal , gives apparent ( though only apparent ) sanction to a reverse order of allusion , by writing of “ the stanzas about C. and himself ” ( her brother ) . The following are her references to the poem in that Journal :</p>
     <p>“ 9th May ( 1802 ). - After tea he ( W .) wrote two stanzas in the manner of Thomson 's ‘ Castle of Indolence ’ , and was tired out .</p>
     <p>“ 10th May .— William still at work , though it is past ten o'clock ... William did not sleep till three o'clock . ”</p>
     <p>“ 11th May .— William finished the stanzas about C. and himself . He did not go out to-day . ... He completely finished his poem . He went to bed at twelve o'clock . ”</p>
     <p>From these extracts two things are evident ,</p>
     <p>( 1 ) who the persons are described in the stanzas , and</p>
     <p>( 2 ) the immense labour bestowed upon the poem .</p>
     <p>In the ‘ Memoirs of Wordsworth ’ , by the late Bishop of Lincoln , there is a passage ( vol . ii . chap . li . p. 309 ) amongst the “ Personal Reminiscences , 1836 , ” in which the Hon . Mr. Justice Coleridge virtually decides the question of the identity of the two persons referred to , in his record of a conversation with the poet . It is as follows :</p>
     <p>“ October 10th .— I have passed a great many hours to-day with Wordsworth in his home . I stumbled on him with proof sheets before him . He read me nearly all the sweet stanzas written in his copy of the ‘ Castle of Indolence ’ , describing himself and my uncle ; and he and Mrs. W. both assured me the description of the latter at that time was perfectly accurate ; and he was almost as a great boy in feelings , and had all the tricks and fancies there described . Mrs. W. seemed to look back on him , and those times , with the fondest affection . ”</p>
     <p>I think “ the neighbouring height ” referred to is the height of White Moss Common , behind the Fir-Grove , where Wordsworth was often heard murmuring out his verses , ” booing ” as the country folks said : and the</p>
     <p>‘ driving full in view At midday when the sun was shining bright , ’</p>
     <p>aptly describes his habits as recorded in his sister 's Journal , and elsewhere . The “ withered flower , ” the “ creature pale and wan , ” are significant of those terrible reactions of spirit , which followed his joyous hours of insight and inspiration . Stanzas IV . to VII . of ‘ Resolution and Independence ’ ( p. 314 ) , in which Wordsworth undoubtedly described himself , may be compared with stanza III . of this poem . The lines</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ Down would he sit ; and without strength or power</l>
       <l n="2">Look at the common grass from hour to hour , ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">are aptly illustrated by such passages in his sister 's Journal , as the</l>
       <l n="4">following , of 29th April 1802 :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ We went to John 's Grove , sate a while at first ; afterwards William lay , and I lay in the trench , under the fence — he with his eyes closed , and listening to the waterfalls and the birds . There was no one waterfall above another — it was a kind of water in the air — the voice of the air . We were unseen by one another . ”</p>
     <p>Again , April 23rd ,</p>
     <p>“ Coleridge and I pushed on before . We left William sitting on the stones , feasting with silence . ”</p>
     <p>And this recalls the first verse of ‘ Expostulation and Reply ’ , written at Alfoxden in 1798 ;</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Why , William , on that old grey stone ,</l>
       <l n="2">Thus for the length of half a day ,</l>
       <l n="3">Why , William , sit you thus alone ,</l>
       <l n="4">And dream your time away ? ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The retreat where “ apple-trees in blossom made a bower , ” and where he so often “ slept himself away , ” was evidently the same as that described in the poem ‘ The Green Linnet ':</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">‘ Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed</l>
       <l n="2">Their snow white blossoms on my head . ’</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">On the other hand , the “ low-hung lip ” and “ profound ” forehead of the</l>
       <l n="4">other , the “ noticeable Man with large grey eyes , ” mark him out as S. T .</l>
       <l n="5">C .; “ the rapt One , of the god-like forehead , ” described in the</l>
       <l n="6">‘ Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg ’ . The description</l>
       <l n="7">“ Noisy he was , and gamesome as a boy , ” is verified by what the poet and</l>
       <l n="8">his wife said to Mr. Justice Coleridge in 1836 . In addition , Mr .</l>
       <l n="9">Hutchinson of Kimbolton tells me he “ often heard his father say that</l>
       <l n="10">Coleridge was uproarious in his mirth . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="11">Matthew Arnold wrote me an interesting letter some years ago about these</l>
       <l n="12">stanzas , from which I make the following extract :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ When one looks uneasily at a poem it is easy to fidget oneself further , and neither the Wordsworth nor the Coleridge of our common notions seem to be exactly hit off in the ‘ Stanzas ’ ; still , I believe that the first described is Wordsworth and that the second described is Coleridge . I have myself heard Wordsworth speak of his prolonged exhausting wanderings among the hills . Then Miss Fenwick 's notes show that Coleridge is certainly one of the two personages of the poem , and there are points in the description of the second man which suit him very well . The ‘ profound forehead ’ is a touch akin to the ‘ god-like forehead ’ in the mention of Coleridge in a later poem .</p>
     <p>“ I have a sort of recollection of having heard something about the ‘ inventions rare , ’ and Coleridge is certain to have dabbled , at one time or other , in natural philosophy . ”</p>
     <p>In 1796 Coleridge wrote to his friend Cottle from Nether Stowey :</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">" ... I should not think of devoting less than 20 years to an Epic</l>
       <l n="2">Poem : ten to collect materials and warm my mind with universal</l>
       <l n="3">science . I would be a tolerable Mathematician , I would thoroughly know</l>
       <l n="4">Mechanics , Hydrostatics , Optics , and Astronomy , Botany , Metallurgy ,</l>
       <l n="5">Fossilism , Chemistry , Geology , Anatomy , Medicine — then the ‘ mind of</l>
       <l n="6">man ’ — then the ‘ minds of men ’ — in all Travels , Voyages , and Histories .</l>
       <l n="7">So I would spend ten years — the next five to the composition of the</l>
       <l n="8">poem — and the last five to the correction of it . So would I write ,</l>
       <l n="9">haply not unhearing of the divine and rightly whispering Voice , ” etc .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="10">Mr. T. Hutchinson ( Dublin ) writes in ‘ The Athenaeum ’ , Dec. 15 , 1894 :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ I take it for granted these lines were written , not only on the fly-leaf of Wordsworth 's copy of the ‘ Castle of Indolence ’ , but also by way of Supplement to that poem ; i. e. as an ‘ addendum ’ to the descriptive list of the denizens of the Castle given in stanzas LVII-LXIX of Canto I .; that , in short , they are meant to be read as though they were an after-thought of James Thomson 's . Their author , therefore , has rightly imparted to them the curiously blended flavour of ‘ romantic melancholy and slippered mirth , ’ of dreamlike vagueness and smiling hyperbole , which forms the distinctive mark of Thomson 's poem ; and thus the Poet and the Philosopher-Friend of Wordsworth 's stanzas , like Thomson 's companion sketches of the splenetic Solitary , the ‘ bard more fat than bard beseems , ’ and the ‘ little , round , fat , oily Man of God , ’ are neither more nor less than gentle caricatures . ”</p>
     <p>It has been suggested by Coleridge 's grandson that Wordsworth was describing S. T. C. in all the stanzas of this poem ; that he drew two separate pictures of him ; in the first four stanzas a realistic “ character portrait , ” and in the last four a “ companion picture , figuring the outward semblance of Coleridge , but embodying characteristics drawn from a third person ” ; so that we have a “ fancy sketch ” mixed up with a real one . I cannot agree with this . The evidence against it is</p>
     <p>( 1 ) Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal ; ( 2 ) the poet 's and his wife 's remarks to Mr. Justice Coleridge ; ( 3 ) the fact that Wordsworth was not in the habit of “ passing from realism into artistic composition , ” except where he distinctly indicated it , as in the case of the Hawkshead Schoolmaster , in the “ Matthew ” poems . Such composite or conglomerate work was quite foreign to Wordsworth 's genius .</p>

      <head>RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE</head>
       <l n="1">Begun May 3 , finished July 4 , 1802 .— Published 1807</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Written at Town-end , Grasmere . This old man I met a few hundred yards from my cottage ; and the account of him is taken from his own mouth . I was in the state of feeling described in the beginning of the poem , while crossing over Barton Fell from Mr. Clarkson 's , at the foot of Ullswater , towards Askham . The image of the hare I then observed on the ridge of the Fell .— I. F .</note>
     <p>This poem was known in the Wordsworth household as “ The Leech-Gatherer , ” although it never received that name in print . An entry in Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal of Friday , 3rd October 1800 , may preface what she wrote in 1802 about the composition of the poem .</p>
     <p>“ When William and I returned from accompanying Jones , we met an old man almost double . He had on a coat thrown over his shoulders above his waistcoat and coat . Under this he carried a bundle , and had an apron on , and a night-cap . His face was interesting . He had dark eyes , and a long nose . John , who afterwards met him at Wytheburn , took him for a Jew . He was of Scotch parents , but had been born in the army . He had had a wife , ‘ and a good woman , and it pleased God to bless him with ten children . ’ All these were dead but one , of whom he had not heard for many years , a sailor . His trade was to gather leeches ; but now leeches were scarce , and he had not strength for it . He lived by begging , and was making his way to Carlisle where he would buy a few books to sell . He said leeches were very scarce , partly owing to this dry season ; but many years they had been scarce . He supposed it was owing to their being much sought after ; that they did not breed fast ; and were of slow growth . Leeches were formerly 2s . 6d . the 100 ; now they were 30s . He had been hurt in driving a cart , his leg broken , his body driven over , his skull fractured . He felt no pain till he recovered from his first insensibility . It was late in the evening , when the light was just going away . ”</p>
     <p>It is most likely that this walk of William and Dorothy Wordsworth “ accompanying Jones , ” was on the day of Jones 's departure from Dove Cottage , viz . 26th September .</p>

     <p>“ Tuesday , 4th May , 1802 .— Though William went to bed nervous and jaded in the extreme , he rose refreshed . I wrote out ‘ The Leech-Gatherer ’ for him , which he had begun the night before , and of which he wrote several stanzas in bed this morning .... ”</p>
     <p>( They started to walk up the Raise to Wytheburn . )</p>
     <p>“ It was very hot ; we rested several times by the way , read , and repeated ‘ The Leech-Gatherer . ’ ”</p>
     <p>“ Friday , 7th May .— William had slept uncommonly well , so , feeling himself strong , he fell to work at ‘ The Leech-Gatherer ’ ; he wrote hard at it till dinner time , then he gave over , tired to death — he had finished the poem . ”</p>
     <p>“ Sunday morning , 9th May .— William worked at ‘ The Leech-Gatherer ’ almost incessantly from morning till tea-time . I copied ‘ The Leech-Gatherer ’ and other poems for Coleridge . I was oppressed and sick at heart , for he wearied himself to death . ”</p>
     <p>“ Sunday , 4th July .—... William finished ‘ The Leech-Gatherer ’ to-day . ”</p>
     <p>“ Monday , 5th July .— I copied out ‘ The Leech-Gatherer ’ for Coleridge , and for us . ”</p>
     <p>From these extracts it is clear that Dorothy Wordsworth considered the poem as “ finished ” on the 7th of May , and on the 9th she sent a copy to Coleridge ; but that it was not till the 4th of July that it was really finished , and then a second copy was forwarded to Coleridge . It is impossible to say from which of the two MSS . sent to him Coleridge transcribed the copy which he forwarded to Sir George Beaumont . From that copy of a copy ( which is now amongst the Beaumont MSS . at Coleorton ) the various readings given , on Coleridge 's authority , in the notes to the poem , were obtained some years ago .</p>
     <p>The Fenwick note to the poem illustrates Wordsworth 's habit of blending in one description details which were originally separate , both as to time and place . The scenery and the incidents of the poem are alike composite . As he tells us that he met the leech-gatherer a few hundred yards from Dove Cottage , the “ lonely place ” with its “ pool , bare to the eye of heaven , ” at once suggests White Moss Common and its small tarn ; but he adds that , in the opening stanzas of the poem , he is describing a state of feeling he was in , when crossing the fells at the foot of Ullswater to Askam , and that the image of the hare “ running races in her mirth , ” with the glittering mist accompanying her , was observed by him , not on White Moss Common , but in one of the ridges of Moor Divock . To H. C. Robinson he said of the “ Leech-Gatherer ” ( Sept. 10 , 1816 ) , that “ he gave to his poetic character powers of mind which his original did not possess . ” ( Robinson 's ‘ Diary ’ , etc ., vol . ii . p . 24 . )</p>

     <p>The late Bishop of Lincoln , in the ‘ Memoirs ’ of his uncle ( vol . i. pp . 172 , 173 ) , quotes from a letter , written by Wordsworth “ to some friends , which has much interest as bearing on this poem . [ C ] The following are extracts from it :</p>
     <p>“ It is not a matter of indifference whether you are pleased with his figure and employment , it may be comparatively whether you are pleased with this Poem ; but it is of the utmost importance that you should have had pleasure in contemplating the fortitude , independence , persevering spirit , and the general moral dignity of this old man 's character . ” Again , “ I will explain to you , in prose , my feelings in writing that poem .... I describe myself as having been exalted to the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature ; and then as depressed , even in the midst of those beautiful objects , to the lowest dejection and despair . A young poet in the midst of the happiness of nature is described as overwhelmed by the thoughts of the miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest of all men , viz . poets . I think of this till I am so deeply impressed with it , that I consider the manner in which I was rescued from my dejection and despair almost as an interposition of Providence . A person reading the poem with feelings like mine will have been awed and controlled , expecting something spiritual or supernatural . What is brought forward ? A lonely place , ‘ a pond , by which an old man was , far from all house or home : ’ not stood , nor sat , but was — the figure presented in the most naked simplicity possible . This feeling of spirituality or supernaturalness is again referred to as being strong in my mind in this passage . How came he here ? thought I , or what can he be doing ? I then describe him , whether ill or well is not for me to judge with perfect confidence ; but this I can confidently affirm , that though I believe God has given me a strong imagination , I cannot conceive a figure more impressive than that of an old man like this , the survivor of a wife and ten children , travelling alone among the mountains and all lonely places , carrying with him his own fortitude and the necessities which an unjust state of society has laid upon him . You speak of his speech as tedious . Every thing is tedious when one does not read with the feelings of the author . ‘ The Thorn ’ is tedious to hundreds ; and so is ‘ The Idiot Boy ’ to hundreds . It is in the character of the old man to tell his story , which an impatient reader must feel tedious . But , good heavens ! such a figure , in such a place ; a pious , self-respecting , miserably infirm and pleased old man telling such a tale ! ”</p>

Professor Dowden asks about it — and very naturally :</note>     <note xml:id="noteA_52" place="bottom" n="A">It is unfortunate that in this , as in many other similar occasions in these delightful volumes by the poet 's nephew , the reticence as to names — warrantable perhaps in 1851 , so soon after the poet 's death — has now deprived the world of every means of knowing to whom many of Wordsworth 's letters were addressed .

     <note>In the cottage of Town-end , one afternoon in 1801 , my sister read to me the sonnets of Milton . I had long been well acquainted with them , but I was particularly struck on that occasion with the dignified simplicity and majestic harmony that runs through most of them — in character so totally different from the Italian , and still more so from Shakespeare 's fine sonnets . I took fire , if I may be allowed to say so , and produced three sonnets the same afternoon , the first I ever wrote , except an irregular one at school . Of these three the only one I distinctly remember is ‘ I grieved for Buonaparté , etc . ’ ; one of the others was never written down ; the third , which was I believe preserved , I cannot particularise .— I. F .</note>
     <p>One of the “ Sonnets dedicated to Liberty , ” afterwards called “ Poems dedicated to National Independence and Liberty . ” From the edition of 1815 onwards , it bore the title ‘ 1801 ’ .— Ed .</p>

     <p>The date which Wordsworth gave to this sonnet on its first publication in 1807 , viz . September 3 , 1803 ,— and which he retained in all subsequent editions of his works till 1836 ,— is inaccurate . He left London for Dover , on his way to Calais , on the 31st of July 1802 . The sonnet was written that morning as he travelled towards Dover . The following record of the journey is preserved in his sister 's Journal :</p>
     <p>“ July 30 . [ A ] — Left London between five and six o'clock of the morning outside the Dover coach . A beautiful morning . The city , St. Paul 's , with the river — a multitude of little boats , made a beautiful sight as we crossed Westminster Bridge ; the houses not overhung by their clouds of smoke , and were hung out endlessly ; yet the sun shone so brightly , with such a pure light , that there was something like the purity of one of Nature 's own grand spectacles . ”</p>
     <p>This sonnet underwent no change in successive editions .</p>
     <p>In illustration of it , an anecdote of the late Bishop of St. David 's may be given , as reported by Lord Coleridge .</p>
     <p>“ In the great debate on the abolition of the Irish Establishment in 1869 , the Bishop of St. David 's , Dr. Thirlwall , had made a very remarkable speech , and had been kept till past daybreak in the House of Lords , before the division was over , and he was able to walk home . He was then an old man , and in failing health . Some time after , he was asked whether he had not run some risk to his health , and whether he did not feel much exhausted . ‘ Yes , ’ he said , ‘ perhaps so ; but I was more than repaid by walking out upon Westminster Bridge after the division , seeing London in the morning light as Wordsworth saw it , and repeating to myself his noble sonnet as I walked home . ’ ”</p>
     <p>This anecdote was told to the Wordsworth Society , at its meeting on the 3rd of May 1882 , after a letter had been read by the Secretary , from Mr. Robert Spence Watson , recording the following similar experience :</p>
     <p>“ ... As confirming the perfect truth of Wordsworth 's description of the external aspects of a scene , and the way in which he reached its inmost soul , I may tell you what happened to me , and may have happened to many others . Many years ago , I think it was in 1859 , I chanced to be passing ( in a pained and depressed state of mind , occasioned by the death of a friend ) over Waterloo Bridge at half-past three on a lovely June morning . It was broad daylight , and I was alone . Never when alone in the remotest recesses of the Alps , with nothing around me but the mountains , or upon the plains of Africa , alone with the wonderful glory of the southern night , have I seen anything to approach the solemnity — the soothing solemnity — of the city , sleeping under the early sun :</p>
     <p>‘ Earth has not any thing to show more fair . ’</p>
     <p>“ How simply , yet how perfectly , Wordsworth has interpreted it ! It was a happy thing for us that the Dover coach left at so untimely an hour . It was this sonnet , I think , that first opened my eyes to Wordsworth 's greatness as a poet . Perhaps nothing that he has written shows more strikingly the vast sympathy which is his peculiar dower . ”</p>

     <p>This sonnet , and the seven that follow it , were written during Wordsworth 's residence at Calais , in the month of August , 1802 . The following extract from his sister 's Journal illustrates it :</p>
     <p>“ We arrived at Calais at four o'clock on Sunday morning the 31st of July . We had delightful walks after the heat of the day was passed — seeing far off in the west the coast of England , like a cloud , crested with Dover Castle , the evening Star , and the glory of the sky ; the reflections in the water were more beautiful than the sky itself ; purple waves brighter than precious stones , for ever melting away upon the sands . ”</p>

     <p>This sonnet , originally entitled ‘ To a Friend , composed near Calais , on the Road leading to Ardres , August 7th , 1802 ’ , was addressed to Robert Jones , of Plas-yn-llan , near Ruthin , Denbighshire , a brother collegian at Cambridge , and afterwards a fellow of St. John 's College , and incumbent of Soulderne , near Deddington , in Oxfordshire . It was to him that Wordsworth dedicated his ‘ Descriptive Sketches ’ , which record their wanderings together in Switzerland ; and it is to the pedestrian tour , undertaken by the two friends in the long vacation of 1790 , that he refers in the above sonnet . The character of Jones is sketched in the poem written in 1800 , beginning :</p>
     <p>‘ I marvel how Nature could ever find space , ’ [ A ]</p>
     <p>and his parsonage in Oxfordshire is described in the sonnet —</p>

     <p>“ This excellent Person , one of my earliest and dearest friends , died in the year 1835 . We were under-graduates together of the same year , at the same college ; and companions in many a delightful ramble through his own romantic Country of North Wales . Much of the latter part of his life he passed in comparative solitude ; which I know was often cheered by remembrance of our youthful adventures , and of the beautiful regions which , at home and abroad , we had visited together . Our long friendship was never subject to a moment 's interruption ,— and , while revising these volumes for the last time , I have been so often reminded of my loss , with a not unpleasing sadness , that I trust the Reader will excuse this passing mention of a Man who well deserves from me something more than so brief a notice . Let me only add , that during the middle part of his life he resided many years ( as Incumbent of the Living ) at a Parsonage in Oxfordshire , which is the subject of one of the ‘ Miscellaneous Sonnets . ’ ”</p>

Her brother used to speak , and to write , of her under many names , “ Emily , ” “ Louisa , ” etc . ; and to call her a “ child ” in 1802 — a “ child of Nature ” she was to the end of her days — or a “ girl , ” seemed quite natural .

     <p>“ We arrived at Calais at four o'clock on Sunday morning , the 3rd of July .... We found out Annette and C ., chez Madame Avril dans la rue de la Tête d'or . The weather was very hot . We walked by the shore almost every evening with Annette and Caroline , or William and I alone .... It was beautiful on the calm hot night to see the little boats row out of harbour with wings of fire , and the sail-boats with the fiery track which they cut as they went along , and which closed up after them with a hundred thousand sparkles and streams of glowworm light . Caroline was delighted . ”</p>
     <p>I have been unable to discover who Annette and Caroline were . Dorothy Wordsworth frequently records in her Grasmere Journal that either William , or she , “ wrote to Annette , ” but who she was is unknown to either the Wordsworth or the Hutchinson family .— Ed . ]</p>

       <l n="4">The special glory of Venice dates from the conquest of Constantinople by</l>
       <l n="5">the Latins in 1202 . The fourth Crusade — in which the French and</l>
       <l n="6">Venetians alone took part — started from Venice , in October 1202 , under</l>
       <l n="7">the command of the Doge , Henry Dandolo . Its aim , however , was not the</l>
       <l n="8">recovery of Palestine , but the conquest of Constantinople . At the close</l>
       <l n="9">of the crusade , Venice received the Morea , part of Thessaly , the</l>
       <l n="10">Cyclades , many of the Byzantine cities , and the coasts of the</l>
       <l n="11">Hellespont , with three-eighths of the city of Constantinople itself , the</l>
       <l n="12">Doge taking the curious title of Duke of three-eighths of the Roman</l>

       <l n="14">“ And was the safeguard of the west . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>This may refer to the prominent part which Venice took in the Crusades , or to the development of her naval power , which made her mistress of the Mediterranean for many years , and an effective bulwark against invasions from the East .</p>
     <p>“ The eldest Child of Liberty . ”</p>
     <p>The origin of the Venetian State was the flight of many of the inhabitants of the mainland — on the invasion of Italy by Attila — to the chain of islands that lie at the head of the Adriatic .</p>
     <p>“ In the midst of the waters , free , indigent , laborious , and inaccessible , they gradually coalesced into a republic : the first foundations of Venice were laid in the island of Rialto .... On the verge of the two empires the Venetians exult in the belief of primitive and perpetual independence . ”</p>

     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ And , when she took unto herself a Mate ,</l>
       <l n="2">She must espouse the everlasting Sea . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In 1177 , Pope Alexander III . appealed to the Venetian Republic for protection against the German Emperor . The Venetians were successful in a naval battle at Saboro , against Otho , the son of Frederick Barbarossa . In return , the Pope presented the Doge Liani with a ring , with which he told him to wed the Adriatic , that posterity might know that the sea was subject to Venice , “ as a bride is to her husband . ”</p>
     <p>In September 1796 , nearly six years before this sonnet was written , the fate of the old Venetian Republic was sealed by the treaty of Campo Formio . The French army under Napoleon had subdued Italy , and , having crossed the Alps , threatened Vienna . To avert impending disaster , the Emperor Francis arranged a treaty which extinguished the Venetian Republic . He divided its territory between himself and Napoleon , Austria retaining Istria , Dalmatia , and the left bank of the Adige in the Venetian State , with the “ maiden city ” itself ; France receiving the rest of the territory and the Ionian Islands . Since the date of that treaty the city has twice been annexed to Italy .— Ed .</p>

       <l n="7">The following is Wordsworth 's note to this sonnet , added in 1837 :</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ In this and a succeeding Sonnet on the same subject , let me be understood as a Poet availing himself of the situation which the King of Sweden occupied , and of the principles AVOWED IN HIS MANIFESTOS ; as laying hold of these advantages for the purpose of embodying moral truths . This remark might , perhaps , as well have been suppressed ; for to those who may be in sympathy with the course of these Poems , it will be superfluous ; and will , I fear , be thrown away upon that other class , whose besotted admiration of the intoxicated despot hereafter placed [ A ] in contrast with him , is the most melancholy evidence of degradation in British feeling and intellect which the times have furnished . ”</p>
     <p>The king referred to is Gustavus IV ., who was born in 1778 , proclaimed king in 1792 , and died in 1837 . His first public act after his accession was to join in the coalition against Napoleon , and dislike of Napoleon was the main-spring of his policy . It is to this that Wordsworth refers in the sonnet :</p>
     <p>‘ ... the illustrious Swede hath done The thing which ought to be ... ’</p>
     <p>It made him unpopular , however , and gave rise to a conspiracy against him , and to his consequent abdication in 1809 . He “ died forgotten and in poverty . ” — Ed .</p>

     <p>Francois Dominique Toussaint ( who was surnamed L'Ouverture ) , the child of African slaves , was born at St. Domingo in 1743 . He was a Royalist in political sympathy till 1794 , when the decree of the French convention , giving liberty to the slaves , brought him over to the side of the Republic . He was made a general of division by Laveux , and succeeded in taking the whole of the north of the island from the English . In 1796 he was made chief of the French army of St. Domingo , and first the British commander , and next the Spanish , surrendered everything to him . He became governor of the island , which prospered under his rule . Napoleon , however , in 1801 , issued an edict re-establishing slavery in St. Domingo . Toussaint professed obedience , but showed that he meant to resist the edict . A fleet of fifty-four vessels was sent from France to enforce it . Toussaint was proclaimed an outlaw . He surrendered , and was received with military honours , but was treacherously arrested and sent to Paris in June 1802 , where he died , in April 1803 , after ten months ’ hardship in prison . He had been two months in prison when Wordsworth addressed this sonnet to him .— Ed .</p>

     <p>Dorothy Wordsworth writes in her Journal ,</p>
     <p>“ On Sunday , the 29th of August , we left Calais , at twelve o'clock in the morning , and landed at Dover at one on Monday the 30th . It was very pleasant to me , when we were in the harbour at Dover , to breathe the fresh air , and to look up and see the stars among the ropes of the vessel . The next day was very hot , we bathed , and sat upon the Dover Cliffs , and looked upon France with many a melancholy and tender thought . We could see the shores almost as plain as if it were but an English lake . We mounted the coach , and arrived in London at six , the 30th August . ”</p>

     <p>The note appended to the sonnet , ‘ Composed in the Valley near Dover , on the day of Landing ’ ( p. 341 ) , shows that this one refers to the same occasion ; and that while “ Inland , within a hollow vale , ” Wordsworth was , at the same time , on the Dover Cliffs ; the “ vale ” being one of the hollow clefts in the headland , which front the Dover coast-line .

     <note>This was written immediately after my return from France to London , when I could not but be struck , as here described , with the vanity and parade of our own country , especially in great towns and cities , as contrasted with the quiet , and I may say the desolation , that the Revolution had produced in France . This must be borne in mind , or else the reader may think that in this and the succeeding Sonnets I have exaggerated the mischief engendered and fostered among us by undisturbed wealth . It would not be easy to conceive with what a depth of feeling I entered into the struggle carried on by the Spaniards for their deliverance from the usurped power of the French . Many times have I gone from Allan Bank in Grasmere Vale , where we were then residing , to the top of Raise-gap , as it is called , so late as two o'clock in the morning , to meet the carrier bringing the newspapers from Keswick . Imperfect traces of the state of mind in which I then was may be found in my tract on the Convention of Cintra , as well as in these Sonnets .— I . F .</note>

       <l n="1">Composed October 4 , 1802 .— Published 1807</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Composed October 4th , 1802 , after a journey over the Hambleton Hills , on a day memorable to me — the day of my marriage . The horizon commanded by those hills is most magnificent . The next day , while we were travelling in a post-chaise up Wensleydale , we were stopped by one of the horses proving restive , and were obliged to wait two hours in a severe storm before the post-boy could fetch from the inn another to supply its place . The spot was in front of Bolton Hall , where Mary Queen of Scots was kept prisoner , soon after her unfortunate landing at Workington . The place then belonged to the Scroops , and memorials of her are yet preserved there . To beguile the time I composed a Sonnet . The subject was our own confinement contrasted with hers ; but it was not thought worthy of being preserved .— I . F .</note>

     <p>The following extract from Dorothy Wordsworth 's Journal indicates , as fully as any other passage in it , the use which her brother occasionally made of it . We have the “ Grecian Temple , ” and the “ Minster with its Tower ":</p>
     <p>“ Before we had crossed the Hambleton Hill and reached the point overlooking Yorkshire it was quite dark . We had not wanted , however , fair prospects before us , as we drove along the flat plain of the high hill ; far , far off from us , in the western sky , we saw shapes of castles , ruins among groves — a great , spreading wood , rocks , and single trees — a Minster with its Tower unusually distinct , Minarets in another quarter , and a round Grecian Temple also ; the colours of the sky of a bright grey , and the forms of a sober grey , with a dome . As we descended the hill there was no distinct view , but of a great space , only near us , we saw the wild ( and as the people say ) bottomless Tarn in the hollow at the side of the hill . It seemed to be made visible to us only by its own light , for all the hill about us was dark . ”</p>
     <p>Wordsworth and his sister crossed over the Hambleton ( or Hamilton ) Hills , on their way from Westmoreland to Gallow Hill , Yorkshire , to visit the Hutchinsons , before they went south to London and Calais , where they spent the month of August , 1802 . But after his marriage to Mary Hutchinson , on the 4th of October , Wordsworth , his wife , and sister , recrossed these Hambleton Hills on their way to Grasmere , which they reached on the evening of the 6th October . The above sonnet was composed on the evening of the 4th October , as the Fenwick note indicates .— Ed .</p>

     <p>taken in connection with his subsequent career , suggest the similarly sad “ presentiment ” with which the ‘ Lines composed above Tintern Abbey ’ conclude . The following is the postscript to a letter by his father , S. T. C ., addressed to Sir Humphry Davy , Keswick , July 25 , 1800 :</p>
     <p>“ Hartley is a spirit that dances on an aspen leaf ; the air that yonder sallow-faced and yawning tourist is breathing , is to my babe a perpetual nitrous oxide . Never was more joyous creature born . Pain with him is so wholly trans-substantiated by the joys that had rolled on before , and rushed on after , that oftentimes five minutes after his mother has whipt him he has gone up and asked her to whip him again . ”</p>

      <note>Variant 1 : The extract from Wither was first prefixed to this poem in the edition of 1815 . The late Mr. Dykes Campbell was of opinion that Charles Lamb had suggested this motto to Wordsworth , as ‘ The Shepherd 's Hunting ’ was Lamb 's “ prime favourite ” amongst Wither 's poems . It may be as well to note that his quotation was erroneous in two places . His “ instruction ” should be “ invention ” ( l. 3 ) , and his “ the ” ( in l. 4 ) should be “ her . ” — Ed .</note>

     <p>The three preceding poems ‘ To the Daisy ’ evidently belong to the same time , and are , as Wordsworth expressly says , “ overflowings of the mind in composing the one which stands first . ” Nevertheless , in the revised edition of 1836-7 , he gave the date 1802 to the first , 1803 to the third , and 1805 to the second of them . In the earlier editions 1815 to 1832 , they are all classed among the “ Poems of the Fancy , ” but in the edition of 1837 , and afterwards , the last , “ Bright Flower ! whose home is everywhere , ” is ranked among the “ Poems of Sentiment and Reflection . ” They should manifestly be placed together . Wordsworth 's fourth poem ‘ To the Daisy ’ , which is an elegy on his brother John , and belongs to a subsequent year — having no connection with the three preceding poems , will be found in its chronological place .— Ed .</p>

     <p>Wordsworth gave as the date of the composition of this poem the year 1805 ; but he said of the following one , ‘ To a Young Lady , who had been Reproached for taking Long Walks in the Country ’ — “ composed at the same time ” and “ designed to make one piece ” — that it was written in 1803 .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">But it is certain that these following lines appeared in ‘ The Morning</l>
       <l n="2">Post ’ , on Feb. 12 , 1802 , where they are headed ‘ To a beautiful Young</l>
       <l n="3">Lady , who had been harshly spoken of on account of her fondness for</l>
       <l n="4">taking long walks in the Country ’ . There is difficulty , both in</l>
       <l n="5">ascertaining the exact date of composition , and in knowing who “ Louisa ”</l>
       <l n="6">or the “ Young Lady ” was . Mrs. Millicent G. Fawcett wrote to me several</l>
       <l n="7">years ago , suggesting , with some plausibility , a much earlier date , if</l>
       <l n="8">Dorothy Wordsworth was the lady referred to . She referred me to</l>
       <l n="9">Dorothy 's letter to her aunt , Mrs. Crackenthorpe , written from</l>
       <l n="10">Windybrow , Keswick , in 1794 , when staying there with her brother ; and</l>
       <l n="11">says</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ What inclined me to think that the poem was written earlier than 1805 was that it anticipates Dorothy 's marriage , and this would more naturally be present as a probable event in W. W .' s mind in 1794 or thereabouts than in 1805 , after Dorothy had dedicated her life to her brother , to the exclusion of all wish to make a home of her own by marriage . The expression ‘ Healthy as a shepherd boy ’ is also more applicable to a girl of twenty-two than to a woman of thirty-three . Do you think it possible that the poem may have been written in 1794 , and not published till later , when its application would be less evident to the family circle ? ”</p>
     <p>Dorothy Wordsworth 's letter will be quoted in full in a later volume , but the following extract from it may be given now :</p>
     <p>“ I cannot pass unnoticed that part of your letter in which you speak of my ‘ rambling about the country on foot . ’ So far from considering this as a matter for condemnation I rather thought it would have given my friends pleasure that I had courage to make use of the strength with which Nature has endowed me , when it not only procured me infinitely more pleasure than I should have received from sitting in a post-chaise , but was also the means of saving me at least thirty shillings . ”</p>
     <p>I do not think the date of composition can be so early as 1794 . What may be called internal , or structural , evidence is against it . Wordsworth never could have written these two poems till after his settlement at Dove Cottage . Besides , in 1794 , he could have no knowledge of a possible “ nest in a green dale , a harbour and a hold ” ; while at that time his sister had certainly no “ cottage home . ” I believe they were written after he took up his residence at Town-end ( the date being uncertain ) ; and that they refer to his sister , and not to his wife . It has been suggested by Mr. Ernest Coleridge ( see ‘ The Athenæum ’ , Oct. 21 , 1893 ) that they refer to Mary Hutchinson : but there is no evidence of Wordsworth taking long country walks with her before their marriage , or that she was “ nymph-like , ” “ fleet and strong , ” that she loved to “ roam the moorland , ” “ in weather rough and bleak , ” or that she “ hunted waterfalls . ” The reference to his sister is confirmed by the omission of the delightful second stanza of the poem in the last edition revised by the poet , that of 1849 , when she was a confirmed invalid at Rydal Mount . Those “ smiles to earth unknown , ” had then ceased for ever . The reason why Wordsworth erased so delightful and wonderful a stanza , is to me only explicable on the supposition , that it was his sister he referred to , she who had accompanied him in former days , in so many of his “ long walks in the country . ” His wife never did this ; she had not the physical strength to do it ; and , if she had been the person referred to , Wordsworth would hardly , in 1845 , have erased such a description of her , as occurs in the stanza written in 1802 , when she was still so vigorous . Besides , Mary Wordsworth was in no sense “ a Child of Nature , ” as Dorothy was : while the testimony of the Wordsworth household is explicit , that it was to his sister , and not to his wife , that the poet referred . I find no difficulty in the allusion made in the second poem to Dorothy being yet possibly a “ Wife and Friend ” ; nor to the fact that it was originally addressed “ To a beautiful Young Lady . ” Neither Dorothy nor Mary Wordsworth were physically “ beautiful , ” according to our highest standards ; although the poet addressed the latter as “ a Phantom of delight , ” and as “ a lovely apparition . ” It is quite true that it was Mary Wordsworth 's old age that was “ serene and bright , ” while Dorothy 's was the very reverse ; but the poet 's anticipation of the future was written when his sister was young , and was by far the stronger of the two .— Ed .</p>

     <p>The poems associated with the year 1803 consist mainly of the “ Memorials of a Tour in Scotland , ” which Wordsworth and his sister took — along with Coleridge — in the autumn of that year , although many of these were not written till some time after the Tour was finished . ‘ The Green Linnet ’ and ‘ Yew-trees ’ were written in 1803 , and some sonnets were composed in the month of October ; but , on the whole , 1803 was not a fruitful year in Wordsworth 's life , as regards his lyrics and smaller poems . Doubtless both ‘ The Prelude ’ and ‘ The Excursion ’ were revised in 1803 .— Ed .</p>

     <p>Of all Wordsworth 's poems this is the one most distinctively associated with the Orchard , at Town-end , Grasmere . Dorothy Wordsworth writes in her Journal under date May 28th , 1802 :</p>
     <p>“ We sat in the orchard . The young bull-finches in their pretty coloured raiment , bustle about among the blossoms , and poise themselves like wire-dancers or tumblers , shaking the twigs and dashing off the blossoms . ”</p>

      <head>YEW-TREES</head>
       <l n="1">Composed 1803 .— Published 1815</l>
     </lg>
     <note>Written at Grasmere . These Yew-trees are still standing , but the spread of that at Lorton is much diminished by mutilation . I will here mention that a little way up the hill , on the road leading from Rosthwaite to Stonethwaite ( in Borrowdale ) lay the trunk of a Yew-tree , which appeared as you approached , so vast was its diameter , like the entrance of a cave , and not a small one . Calculating upon what I have observed of the slow growth of this tree in rocky situations , and of its durability , I have often thought that the one I am describing must have been as old as the Christian era . The Tree lay in the line of a fence . Great masses of its ruins were strewn about , and some had been rolled down the hillside and lay near the road at the bottom . As you approached the tree , you were struck with the number of shrubs and young plants , ashes , etc ., which had found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no inconsiderable height , forming , as it were , a part of the hedgerow . In no part of England , or of Europe , have I ever seen a yew-tree at all approaching this in magnitude , as it must have stood . By the bye , Hutton , the old guide , of Keswick , had been so impressed with the remains of this tree , that he used gravely to tell strangers that there could be no doubt of its having been in existence before the flood .— I.

     <p>The text of this poem was never altered . The Lorton Yew-tree — which , in 1803 , was “ of vast circumference , ” the “ pride of Lorton Vale , ” and described as :</p>
     <p>‘ a living thing Produced too slowly ever to decay ; Of form and aspect too magnificent To be destroyed — ’</p>
     <p>does not now verify its poet 's prediction of the future . Mr. Wilson Robinson of Whinfell Hall , Cockermouth , wrote to me of it in May 1880 :</p>
     <p>“ The tree in outline expanded towards the root considerably : then , at about two feet from the ground , the trunk began to separate into huge limbs , spreading in all directions . I once measured this trunk at its least circumference , and found it 23 feet 10 inches . For the last 50 or 60 years the branches have been gradually dying on the S. E. side , and about 25 years ago a strong S. E. gale , coming with accumulated force down Hope Gill , and — owing to the tree being so open on that side — taking it laterally at a disadvantage , wrenched off one of the great side branches down to the ground , carrying away nearly a third of the tree . This event led to farther peril ; for , the second portion having been sold to a cabinetmaker at Whitehaven for £ 15 , this gave the impression that the wood was very valuable ( owing to the celebrity of the tree ) ; and a local woodmonger bought the remainder . Two men worked half a day to grub it up ; but a Cockermouth medical gentleman , hearing what was going on , made representations to the owner , and it ended in the woodmen sparing the remainder of the tree , which was not much the worse for what had been done . Many large dead branches have also been cut off , and now we have to regret that the ‘ pride of Lorton Vale , ’ shorn of its ancient dignity , is but a ruin , much more venerable than picturesque . ”</p>
     <p>The “ fraternal Four of Borrowdale ” are certainly “ worthier still of note . ” The “ trunk ” described in the Fenwick note , as on the road between Rosthwaite and Stonethwaite , has disappeared long ago ; but the “ solemn and capacious grove ” existed till 1883 in its integrity . The description in the poem is realistic throughout , while the visible scene suggests</p>
     <p>“ an ideal grove , in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet , and sleep , and offer worship to the Destiny that abides above them , while the mountain flood , as if from another world , makes music to which they dimly listen . ”</p>
     <p>( Stopford A. Brooke , in ‘ Theology in the English Poets ’ , p . 259 . ) With the first part of the poem Wordsworth 's ‘ Sonnet composed at —— Castle ’ during the Scotch Tour of 1803 may be compared ( p. 410 ) . For a critical estimate of the poem see ‘ Modern Painters ’ , part III . sec . II , chap . iv . Ruskin alludes to “ the real and high action of the imagination in Wordsworth 's ‘ Yew-trees ’ ( perhaps the most vigorous and solemn bit of forest landscape ever painted ) . It is too long to quote , but the reader should refer to it : let him note especially , if painter , that pure touch of colour , ‘ by sheddings from the pining umbrage tinged . ’ ” See also Coleridge 's criticism in ‘ Biographia Literaria ’ , vol . ii . p. 177 , edition 1847 , and his daughter Sara 's comment on her father 's note . There can be little doubt that , as Professor Dowden has suggested , the lines 23 to 28 were suggested to Wordsworth by Virgil 's lines in the Sixth Book of the ‘ Æneid ’ , 273-284 —</p>

       <l n="2">Borrowdale will be found under date Sept. 16 and 20 , 1816 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The pride of Lorton Vale ” is now a ruin , and has lost all its ancient majesty : but , until the close of 1883 , the “ fraternal four ” of Borrowdale were still to be seen “ in grand assemblage . ” Every one who has felt the power of Wordsworth 's poetry ,— and especially those who had visited the Seathwaite valley , and read the ‘ Yew-Trees ’ under the shade of that once “ solemn and capacious grove ” before 1884 ,— must have felt as if they had lost a personal friend , when they heard that the “ grove ” was gone . The great gale of December 11 , 1883 , smote it fiercely , uprooting one of the trees , and blowing the others to ribbands . The following is Mr. Rawnsley 's account of the disaster :</p>
     <p>‘ Last week the gale that ravaged England did the Lake country much harm . We could spare many of the larch plantations , and could hear ( with a sigh ) of the fall of the giant Scotch firs opposite the little Scafell Inn at Rosthwaite , and that Watendlath had lost its pines ; but who could spare those ancient Yews , the great</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ ... fraternal Four of Borrowdale ,</l>
       <l n="2">Joined in one solemn and capacious grove ;</l>
       <l n="3">Huge trunks ! and each particular trunk a growth</l>
       <l n="4">Of intertwisted fibres serpentine</l>
       <l n="5">Up-coiling , and inveterately convolved . ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ For beneath their pillared shade since Wordsworth wrote his poem , that Yew-tree grove has suggested to many a wanderer up Borrowdale , and visitant to the Natural Temple ,</p>
     <p>“ an ideal grove in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet , and sleep , and offer worship to the Destiny that abides above them , while the mountain flood , as if from another world , makes music to which they dimly listen . ”</p>
     <p>‘ These Yew-trees , seemingly</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Produced too slowly ever to decay ;</l>
       <l n="2">Of form and aspect too magnificent</l>
       <l n="3">To be destroyed , ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>‘ have been ruthlessly overthrown . One has been uprooted bodily ; all the leaders and branches of the others have been wrenched from the main trunk ; and the three still standing are bare poles and broken wreckage . Until one visits the spot one can have no conception of the wholesale destruction that the hurricane has wrought ; until he looks on the huge rosy-hearted branches he cannot guess the tremendous force with which the tornado had fallen upon that “ sable roof of boughs . ”</p>
     <p>‘ For tornado or whirlwind it must needs have been . The Yews grew under the eastern flank of the hill called Base Brown . The gale raged from the westward . One could hardly believe it possible that the trees could have been touched by it ; for the barrier hill on which they grew ,— and under whose shelter they have seen centuries of storm ,— goes straight upwards , betwixt them and the west . It was only realizable when , standing amid the wreckage , and looking across the valley , it was seen that a larch plantation had been entirely levelled , and evidently by a wind that was coming from the east , and directly toward the Yew-trees . On enquiring at Seathwaite Farm , one found that all the slates blown from the roof of that building on the west side , had been whirled up clean over the roof : and we can only surmise that the winds rushing from the west and north-west , and meeting the bastions of Glaramara and the Sty-head slopes , were whirled round in the ‘ cul-de-sac ’ of the valley , and moved with churning motion back from east to west over the Seathwaite Farm , and so in straight line across the beck , and up the slope to the Yew-tree cluster . With what a wrenching , and with what violence , these trees were in a moment shattered , only those can guess who now witness the ruins of the pillared shade , upon the “ grassless floor of red-brown hue .

      <head>MEMORIALS OF A TOUR IN SCOTLAND</head>
       <l n="1">1803</l>
     </lg>
     <p>These poems were first collected , under the above title , in the edition of 1827 . In 1807 , nine of them — viz . ‘ Rob Roy 's Grave ’ , ‘ The Solitary Reaper ’ , ‘ Stepping Westward ’ , ‘ Glen Almain , or , The Narrow Glen ’ , ‘ The Matron of Jedborough and her Husband ’ , ‘ To a Highland Girl ’ , ‘ Sonnet ’ , ‘ To the Sons of Burns after visiting the Grave of their Father ’ , ‘ Yarrow Unvisited ’ ,— were printed under the title , “ Poems written during a Tour in Scotland . ” This group begins the second volume of the edition of that year . But in 1815 and 1820 — when Wordsworth began to arrange his poems in groups — they were distributed with the rest of the series in the several artificial sections . Although some were composed after the Tour was finished — and the order in which Wordsworth placed them is not the order of the Scotch Tour itself — it is advisable to keep to his own method of arrangement in dealing with this particular group , for the same reason that we retain it in such a series as the Duddon Sonnets .— Ed .</p>

     <note>Mr. Coleridge , my sister , and myself started together from Town-end to make a tour in Scotland . Poor Coleridge was at that time in bad spirits , and somewhat too much in love with his own dejection ; and he departed from us , as is recorded in my Sister 's Journal , soon after we left Loch Lomond . The verses that stand foremost among these Memorials were not actually written for the occasion , but transplanted from my ‘ Epistle to Sir George Beaumont ’ .— I . F .</note>

       <l n="11">O'er Limbo lake with aëry flight to steer ,</l>
       <l n="12">And on the verge of Chaos hang in fear .</l>
       <l n="13">Such animation often do I find ,</l>
       <l n="14">Power in my breast , wings growing in my mind ,</l>
       <l n="15">Then , when some rock or hill is overpast , 15</l>

       <l n="18">Of things , has fenced this fairest spot on earth .</l>
       <l n="19">O pleasant transit , Grasmere ! to resign</l>
       <l n="20">Such happy fields , abodes so calm as thine ; 20</l>
       <l n="21">Not like an outcast with himself at strife ;</l>
       <l n="22">The slave of business , time , or care for life ,</l>
       <l n="23">But moved by choice ; or , if constrained in part ,</l>
       <l n="24">Yet still with Nature 's freedom at the heart ;—</l>
       <l n="25">To cull contentment upon wildest shores , 25</l>
       <l n="26">And luxuries extract from bleakest moors ;</l>
       <l n="27">With prompt embrace all beauty to enfold ,</l>
       <l n="28">And having rights in all that we behold .</l>
       <l n="29">— Then why these lingering steps ?— A bright adieu ,</l>
       <l n="30">For a brief absence , proves that love is true ; 30</l>
       <l n="31">Ne'er can the way be irksome or forlorn</l>
       <l n="32">That winds into itself for sweet return .</l>

     <p>“ Thursday , August 18th .— Went to the churchyard where Burns is buried . A bookseller accompanied us . He showed us the outside of Burns 's house , where he had lived the last three years of his life , and where he died . It has a mean appearance , and is in a bye situation , whitewashed .... Went on to visit his grave . He lies at a corner of the churchyard , and his second son , Francis Wallace , beside him . There is no stone to mark the spot ; but a hundred guineas have been collected , to be expended on some sort of monument .</p>
     <p>‘ There , ’ said the bookseller , pointing to a pompous monument , ‘ there lies Mr. Such-a-one . I have forgotten his name . A remarkably clever man ; he was an attorney , and hardly ever lost a cause he undertook . Burns made many a lampoon upon him , and there they rest , as you see . ’</p>
     <p>We looked at the grave with melancholy and painful reflections , repeating to each other his own verses .</p>

     <p>“ I cannot take leave of the country which we passed through to-day without mentioning that we saw the Cumberland Mountains , within half-a-mile of Ellisland , Burns 's house , the last view we had of them . Drayton has prettily described the connection which this neighbourhood has with ours when he makes Skiddaw say :</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ Seurfell [ E ] from the sky ,</l>
       <l n="2">That Anadale [ F ] doth crown , with a most amorous eye ,</l>
       <l n="3">Salutes me every day , or at my pride looks grim ,</l>
       <l n="4">Oft threatening me with clouds , as I oft threatening him ! ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ These lines recurred to William 's memory , and we talked of Burns , and of the prospect he must have had , perhaps from his own door , of Skiddaw and his companions , including ourselves in the fancy , that we might have been personally known to each other , and he have looked upon those objects with more pleasure for our sakes . ”</p>

     <p>See the note to the previous poem . The line</p>
     <p>‘ These pathways , yon far-stretching road ! ’</p>
     <p>refers probably to the road to Brownhill , past Ellisland farmhouse where Burns lived . “ The day following ” would be Aug. 19th , 1803 . The extract which follows from the Journal is a further illustration of the poem . August 8th .</p>
     <p>“ ... Travelled through the vale of Nith , here little like a vale , it is so broad , with irregular hills rising up on each side , in outline resembling the old-fashioned valances of a bed . There is a great deal of arable land ; the corn ripe ; trees here and there — plantations , clumps , coppices , a newness in everything . So much of the gorse and broom rooted out that you wonder why it is not all gone , and yet there seems to be almost as much gorse and broom as corn ; and they grow one among another you know not how . Crossed the Nith ; the vale becomes narrow , and very pleasant ; cornfields , green hills , clay cottages ; the river 's bed rocky , with woody banks . Left the Nith about a mile and a half , and reached Brownhill , a lonely inn , where we slept . The view from the windows was pleasing , though some travellers might have been disposed to quarrel with it for its general nakedness ; yet there was abundance of corn . It is an open country — open , yet all over hills . At a little distance were many cottages among trees , that looked very pretty . Brownhill is about seven or eight miles from Ellisland . I fancied to myself , while I was sitting in the parlour , that Burns might have caroused there , for most likely his rounds extended so far , and this thought gave a melancholy interest to the smoky walls .... ”</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">On Dec. 23 , 1839 , Wordsworth wrote to Professor Henry Reed ,</l>
       <l n="2">Philadelphia :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The other day I chanced to be looking over a MS. poem belonging to the year 1803 , though not actually composed till many years afterwards . It was suggested by visiting the neighbourhood of Dumfries , in which Burns had resided , and where he died : it concluded thus :</p>
     <p>‘ Sweet Mercy ! to the gates of Heaven , etc . ’</p>
     <p>I instantly added , the other day ,</p>
     <p>‘ But why to Him confine the prayer , etc . ’</p>
     <p>The more I reflect upon this , the more I feel justified in attaching comparatively small importance to any literary monument that I may be enabled to leave behind . It is well however , I am convinced , that men think otherwise in the earlier part of their lives .... ”</p>
     <p>It may be mentioned that in his note to the “ Poems , chiefly of Early and Late Years , ” ( 1842 ) , Wordsworth does not quote from the text of his sister 's Journal ,— which was first published in 1875 ,— but from some other copy of it .— Ed .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>“ Sunday , August 28th .—... After long waiting , the girls , who had been on the look-out , informed us that the boat was coming . I went to the waterside , and saw a cluster of people on the opposite shore ; but , being yet at a distance , they looked more like soldiers surrounding a carriage than a group of men and women ; red and green were the distinguishable colours . We hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as we saw the party approach , but had longer to wait than we expected , the lake being wider than it appears to be . As they drew near we could distinguish men in tartan plaids , women in scarlet cloaks , and green umbrellas by the half-dozen . The landing was as pretty a sight as ever I saw . The bay , which had been so quiet two days before , was all in motion with small waves , while the swollen waterfall roared in our ears . The boat came steadily up , being pressed almost to the water 's edge by the weight of its cargo ; perhaps twenty people landed , one after another . It did not rain much , but the women held up their umbrellas ; they were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow , and with their scarlet cardinals , the tartan plaids of the men , and Scotch bonnets , made a gay appearance . There was a joyous bustle surrounding the boat , which even imparted something of the same character to the waterfall in its tumult , and the restless grey waves ; the young men laughed and shouted , the lasses laughed , and the elder folks seemed to be in a bustle to be away . I remember well with what haste the mistress of the house where we were ran up to seek after her child , and seeing us , how anxiously and kindly she inquired how we had fared , if we had had a good fire , had been well waited upon , etc . All this in three minutes — for the boatman had another party to bring from the other side , and hurried us off .</p>
     <p>“ The hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and Mr. Macfarlane 's gave us very favourable impressions on this our first entrance into the Highlands , and at this day the innocent merriment of the girls , with their kindness to us , and the beautiful face and figure of the elder , come to my mind whenever I think of the ferry-house and waterfall of Loch Lomond , and I never think of the two girls but the whole image of that romantic spot is before me , a living image as it will be to my dying day . The following poem was written by William not long after our return from Scotland . ”</p>

      <p>The glen is Glenalmond , in Perthshire , between Crieff and Amulree , known locally as “ the Sma ’ Glen . ” I am not aware that it was ever called “ Glen Almain , ” till Wordsworth gave it that singularly un-Scottish name . [ B ] It must have been a warm August day , after a tract of dry weather , when he went through it , or the Almond would scarcely have been called a “ small streamlet . ” In many seasons of the year the distinctive features of the Glen would be more appropriately indicated by the words , which the poet uses by way of contrast with his own experience of it , viz . a place</p>
       <l n="1">‘ Where sights are rough , and sounds are wild ,</l>
       <l n="2">And everything unreconciled . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>But his characterization of the place — a glen , the charm of which is little known — in the stillness of an autumn afternoon , is as true to nature as any of his interpretations of the spirit of the hills and vales of Westmoreland . As yet there is no farm-house , scarcely even a sheiling , to “ break the silence of this Dell . ”</p>
     <p>The following is Dorothy Wordsworth 's account of their walk through it on Friday , September 9th , 1803 :</p>
     <p>“ Entered the glen at a small hamlet at some distance from the head , and , turning aside a few steps , ascended a hillock which commanded a view to the top of it — a very sweet scene , a green valley , not very narrow , with a few scattered trees and huts , almost invisible in a misty green of afternoon light . At this hamlet we crossed a bridge , and the road led us down the glen , which had become exceedingly narrow , and so continued to the end : the hills on both sides heathy and rocky , very steep , but continuous ; the rock not single or overhanging , not scooped into caverns , or sounding with torrents ; there are no trees , no houses , no traces of cultivation , not one outstanding object . It is truly a solitude , the road even making it appear still more so ; the bottom of the valley is mostly smooth and level , the brook not noisy : everything is simple and undisturbed , and while we passed through it the whole place was shady , cool , clear , and solemn . At the end of the long valley we ascended a hill to a great height , and reached the top , when the sun , on the point of setting , shed a soft yellow light upon every eminence . The prospect was very extensive ; over hollows and plains , no towns , and few houses visible — a prospect , extensive as it was , in harmony with the secluded dell , and fixing its own peculiar character of removedness from the world , and the secure possession of the quiet of nature more deeply in our minds . The following poem was written by William on hearing of a tradition relating to it , which we did not know when we were there . ”</p>
     <p>Ed .</p>
<note>Footnote B : In the Statistical Account of Scotland , however — drawn up by the parish ministers of the county , and edited by Sir John Sinclair — both the river and the glen are spelt Almon , by the Rev . Mr. Erskine , who wrote the account of Monzie Parish in Perthshire . This was in 1795 . A recent authority states :</note>     <note xml:id="noteB_37" place="bottom" n="B">In the Statistical Account of Scotland , however — drawn up by the parish ministers of the county , and edited by Sir John Sinclair — both the river and the glen are spelt Almon , by the Rev .

     <p>“ ‘ Glenamon , ’ in Ayrshire , and ‘ Glenalmond , ’ in Perthshire , are both from the corrupted spelling of the word ‘ Avon , ’ which derives from its being very nearly the pronunciation of the Gaelic word for ‘ a river . ’ These names are from ‘ Gleann-abhuinn , ’ that is ,' the valley of the river . ’ ”</p>

       <l n="1">The following is from the ‘ Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland ':</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Sunday , Sept . 11th .— We have never had a more delightful walk than this evening . Ben Lomond and the three pointed-topped mountains of Loch Lomond , which we had seen from the garrison , were very majestic under the clear sky , the lake perfectly calm , the air sweet and mild . I felt that it was much more interesting to visit a place where we have been before than it can possibly be the first time , except under peculiar circumstances . The sun had been set for some time , when , being within a quarter of a mile of the ferry man 's hut , our path having led us close to the shore of the calm lake , we met two neatly-dressed women , without hats , who had probably been taking their Sunday evening 's walk . One of them said to us in a friendly , soft tone of voice , ‘ What , you are stepping westward ? ’ I cannot describe how affecting this simple expression was in that remote place , with the western sky in front , yet glowing with the departed sun . William wrote the following poem long after , in remembrance of his feelings and mine . ”</p>

       <l n="4">The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth 's ‘ Recollections ’ of the Tour :</l>
       <l n="5">13th Sept. 1803 .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>“ As we descended , the scene became more fertile , our way being pleasantly varied — through coppices or open fields , and passing farm-houses , though always with an intermixture of cultivated ground . It was harvest-time , and the fields were quietly — might I be allowed to say pensively ?— enlivened by small companies of reapers . It is not uncommon in the more lonely parts of the Highlands to see a single person so employed . The following poem was suggested to William by a beautiful sentence in Thomas Wilkinson 's ‘ Tour in Scotland . ’ ”</p>
     <p>In a note appended to the editions 1807 to 1820 , Wordsworth wrote :</p>
     <p>“ This Poem was suggested by a beautiful sentence in a MS. ‘ Tour in Scotland , ’ written by a Friend , the last line being taken from it verbatim . ”</p>
     <p>The first part of Wilkinson 's ‘ Tours to the British Mountains ’ , which was published in 1824 , narrates his journey in Scotland ( it took place in 1787 ) ; and the following sentence occurs in the record of his travels near Loch Lomond ( p. 12 ) ,</p>
     <p>“ Passed a female who was reaping alone : she sung in Erse , as she bended over her sickle ; the sweetest human voice I ever heard : her strains were tenderly melancholy , and felt delicious , long after they were heard no more . ”</p>
     <p>There can be no doubt that this is the sentence referred to both by Dorothy and William Wordsworth . Thomas Wilkinson was the friend , in whose memory Wordsworth wrote the poem ‘ To the Spade of a Friend , composed while we were labouring together in his pleasure-ground ’ . They were comparatively near neighbours , as Wilkinson lived near Yanwath on the Emont ; and he had given his MS. to the Wordsworth family to read . I have received some additional information about this MS ., and Wordsworth 's knowledge of it , from Mr. Wilson Robinson , who writes ,</p>
     <p>“ From all the evidence , I conclude that Wilkinson 's ‘ Tour to the Highlands ’ was shown in manuscript to his friends soon after his return ;— that he was not only willing to show it , but even to allow it to be copied , though reluctant to publish it ;— that there was sufficient intimacy between him and the Wordsworths to account for his showing or lending the manuscript to them , especially as they had travelled over much of the same ground , and would therefore be more interested in it ; and that in fact it was never published till 1824 . ”</p>
     <p>When Wordsworth was living at Coleorton during the late autumn of 1806 he wrote to Wilkinson :</p>
     <p>“ ... What shall I say in apology for your Journal , which is now locked up with my manuscripts at Grasmere . As I could not go over to your part of the country myself , my intention was to have taken it with me to Kendal ... to be carefully transmitted to you ; unluckily , most unluckily , in the hurry of departure , I forgot it , together with two of my own manuscripts which were along with it ; and I am afraid you will be standing in great need of it .... If you do not want it , it is in a place where it can take no injury , and I may have the pleasure of delivering it to you myself in the spring .... ”</p>

     <p>“ From the top of the hill a most impressive scene opened upon our view ,— a ruined Castle on an Island ( for an Island the flood had made it ) [ A ] at some distance from the shore , backed by a Cove of the Mountain Cruachan , down which came a foaming stream . The Castle occupied every foot of the Island that was visible to us , appearing to rise out of the Water ,— mists rested upon the mountain side , with spots of sunshine ; there was a mild desolation in the low-grounds , a solemn grandeur in the mountains , and the Castle was wild , yet stately — not dismantled of Turrets — nor the walls broken down , though obviously a ruin . ”</p>

     <p>From the following passage in Dorothy Wordsworth 's ‘ Recollections ’ of their Tour , it will be seen that the poet altered the text considerably in making his quotation in 1827 : August 31 , 1803 .</p>
     <p>“ When we had ascended half-way up the hill , directed by the man , I took a nearer foot-path , and at the top came in view of a most impressive scene , a ruined castle on an island almost in the middle of the last compartment of the lake , backed by a mountain cove , down which came a roaring stream . The castle occupied every foot of the island that was visible to us , appearing to rise out of the water ; mists rested upon the mountain side , with spots of sunshine between ; there was a mild desolation in the low grounds , a solemn grandeur in the mountains , and the castle was wild , yet stately , not dismantled of its turrets , nor the walls broken down , though completely in ruin . After having stood some minutes I joined William on the highroad , and both wishing to stay longer near this place , we requested the man to drive his little boy on to Dalmally , about two miles further , and leave the car at the inn . He told us the ruin was called Kilchurn Castle , that it belonged to Lord Breadalbane , and had been built by one of the ladies of that family for her defence , during her lord 's absence at the Crusades ; for which purpose she levied a tax of seven years ’ rent upon her tenants ; he said that from that side of the lake it did not appear , in very dry weather , to stand upon an island , but that it was possible to go over to it without being wet-shod . We were very lucky in seeing it after a great flood ; for its enchanting effect was chiefly owing to its situation in the lake , a decayed palace rising out of the plain of waters ! I have called it a palace , for such feeling it gave me , though having been built as a place of defence , a castle or fortress . We turned again and reascended the hill , and sate a long time in the middle of it looking on the castle , and the huge mountain cove opposite , and William , addressing himself to the ruin , poured out these verses . ”</p>

     <p>The History of Rob Roy is sufficiently known ; his Grave is near the head of Loch Ketterine , in one of those small Pin-fold-like Burial-grounds , of neglected and desolate appearance , which the Traveller meets with in the Highlands of Scotland .— W . W. 1807 .</p>
     <note>I have since been told that I was misinformed as to the burial-place of Rob Roy .

F .</note>
     <p>In the copy of ‘ Rob Roy 's Grave ’ , transcribed in Dorothy Wordsworth 's ‘ Recollections ’ of the Tour in Scotland of 1803 , there are several important variations of text , which occur in none of the printed editions of the poem .

       <l n="1">In Dorothy Wordsworth 's ‘ Recollections ’ of the Scotch Tour the following</l>
       <l n="2">occurs :</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ August 27 , 1803 .— We mentioned Rob Roy , and the eyes of all glistened ; even the lady of the house , who was very diffident , and no great talker , exclaimed , ‘ He was a good man , Rob Roy ! he had been dead only about eighty years , had lived in the next farm , which belonged to him , and there his bones were laid . ’ He was a famous swordsman . Having an arm much longer than other men , he had a greater command with his sword . As a proof of the length of his arm , they told us that he could garter his tartan stockings below the knee without stooping , and added a dozen different stories of single combats , which he had fought , all in perfect good humour , merely to prove his prowess . I daresay they had stories of this kind which would hardly have been exhausted in the long evenings of a whole December week , Rob Roy being as famous here as even Robin Hood was in the forest of Sherwood ; he also robbed from the rich , giving to the poor , and defending them from oppression . They tell of his confining the factor of the Duke of Montrose in one of the islands of Loch Ketterine , after having taken his money from him — the Duke 's rents — in open day , while they were sitting at table . He was a formidable enemy of the Duke , but being a small laird against a greater , was overcome at last , and forced to resign all his lands on the Braes of Loch Lomond , including the caves which we visited , on account of the money he had taken from the Duke and could not repay . ”</p>
     <p>September 12 :</p>
     <p>“ Descended into Glengyle , above Loch Ketterine , and passed through Mr. Macfarlane 's grounds , that is , through the whole of the glen , where there was now no house left but his . We stopped at his door to inquire after the family , though with little hope of finding them at home , having seen a large company at work in a hay-field , whom we conjectured to be his whole household , as it proved , except a servant-maid who answered our enquiries . We had sent the ferryman forward from the head of the glen to bring the boat round from the place where he left it to the other side of the lake . Passed the same farm-house we had such good reason to remember , and went up to the burying-ground that stood so sweetly near the water-side . The ferryman had told us that Rob Roy 's grave was there , so we could not pass on without going up to the spot . There were several tombstones , but the inscriptions were either worn-out or unintelligible to us , and the place choked up with nettles and brambles . You will remember the description I have given of the spot . I have nothing here to add , except the following poem which it suggested to William . ”</p>
     <p>Rob Roy was buried at the Kirkton of Balquhidder , near the outlet of Loch Voil in Perthshire . There are three sculptured stones in the rude burial-place of the Macgregors , at the eastern end of the old church . The one with the long claymore marks the resting-place of Rob Roy 's wife ; the one opposite on the other side is the tomb of his eldest son ; and the central stone , more elaborately carved , marks the grave of the hero himself .— Ed .</p>

     <p>“ Sunday , September 18th .— After breakfast walked up the river to Neidpath Castle , about a mile and a half from the town . The castle stands upon a green hill , over-looking the Tweed , a strong square-towered edifice , neglected and desolate , though not in ruin , the garden overgrown with grass , and the high walls that fenced it broken down . The Tweed winds between green steeps , upon which , and close to the river side , large flocks of sheep pasturing ; higher still are the grey mountains ; but I need not describe the scene , for William has done it better than I could do in a sonnet which he wrote the same day ; the five last lines , at least , of his poem will impart to you more of the feeling of the place than it would be possible for me to do . ”</p>
     <p>( Dorothy Wordsworth 's ‘ Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland ’ . ) Writing to Sir Walter Scott ( October 16 , 1803 ) , Wordsworth enclosed a copy of this sonnet , with the variation of text which has been quoted . Lockhart tells us</p>
     <p>“ in that original shape Scott always recited it , and few lines in the language were more frequently in his mouth . ”</p>

     <p>Never could I have written ‘ swans ’ in the plural . The scene when I saw it , with its still and dim lake , under the dusky hills , was one of utter loneliness : there was one swan , and one only , stemming the water , and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan , its own white image in the water . It was for that reason that I recorded the Swan and the Shadow . Had there been many swans and many shadows , they would have implied nothing as regards the character of the place ; and I should have said nothing about them . ”</p>
     <p>See his ‘ Essays , chiefly on Poetry ’ , vol . ii . p. 277 .</p>
     <p>Wordsworth wrote to his friend , Walter Scott , to thank him for a copy of ‘ The Lay of the Last Minstrel ’ , and in return sent a copy of these stanzas , ‘ Yarrow Unvisited ’ . Scott replied gratefully on the 16th March 1805 , and said ,</p>
     <p>“ ... I by no means admit your apology , however ingeniously and artfully stated , for not visiting the bonny holms of Yarrow , and certainly will not rest till I have prevailed upon you to compare the ideal with the real stream . ”</p>
     <p>Wordsworth had asked him if he could suggest any name more true to the place than Burnmill , in the line , “ The sweets of Burn-mill meadow . ” Scott replied :</p>
     <p>“ We have Broad-meadow upon Yarrow , which with the addition of green or fair or any other epithet of one syllable , will give truth to the locality , and supply the place of Burnmill meadow , which we have not . ... I like your swan upon St. Mary 's Lake . How came you to know that it is actually frequented by that superb bird ? ”</p>

     <p>“ September 18 , 1803 .— We left the Tweed when we were within about a mile and a half or two miles of Clovenford , where we were to lodge . Turned up the side of a hill , and went along sheep-grounds till we reached the spot — a single stone house , without a tree near it or to be seen from it . On our mentioning Mr. Scott 's name , the woman of the house showed us all possible civility , but her slowness was really amusing . I should suppose it a house little frequented , for there is no appearance of an inn . Mr. Scott , who she told me was a very clever gentleman , ‘ goes there in the fishing season ; ’ but indeed Mr. Scott is respected everywhere ; I believe that by favour of his name one might be hospitably entertained throughout all the borders of Scotland . We dined and drank tea — did not walk out , for there was no temptation ; a confined barren prospect from the window .</p>
     <p>“ At Clovenford , being so near to the Yarrow , we could not but think of the possibility of going thither , but came to the conclusion of reserving the pleasure for some future time , in consequence of which , after our return , William wrote the poem which I shall here transcribe . ”</p>

     <p>Sept. 20 , 1803 .</p>
     <p>“ We were received with hearty welcome by a good woman , who , though above seventy years old , moved about as briskly as if she was only seventeen . Those parts of the house which we were to occupy were neat and clean ; she showed me every corner , and , before I had been ten minutes in the house , opened her very drawers that I might see what a stock of linen she had ; then asked how long we should stay , and said she wished we were come for three months . She was a most remarkable person ; the alacrity with which she ran up-stairs when we rung the bell , and guessed at , and strove to prevent , our wants was surprising ; she had a quick eye , and keen strong features , and a joyousness in her motions , like what used to be in old Molly when she was particularly elated . I found afterwards that she had been subject to fits of dejection and ill-health : we then conjectured that her overflowing gaiety and strength might in part be attributed to the same cause as her former dejection . Her husband was deaf and infirm , and sate in a chair with scarcely the power to move a limb — an affecting contrast ! The old woman said they had been a very hard-working pair ; they had wrought like slaves at their trade — her husband had been a currier ; and she told me how they had portioned off their daughters with money , and each a feather bed , and that in their old age they had laid out the little they could spare in building and furnishing that house , and she added with pride that she had lived in her youth in the family of Lady Egerton , who was no high lady , and now was in the habit of coming to her house whenever she was at Jedburgh , and a hundred other things ; for when she once began with Lady Egerton , she did not know how to stop , nor did I wish it , for she was very entertaining . Mr. Scott sat with us an hour or two , and repeated a part of the ‘ Lay of the Last Minstrel ’ . When he was gone our hostess came to see if we wanted anything , and to wish us good-night . On all occasions her manners were governed by the same spirit : there was no withdrawing one 's attention from her . We were so much interested that William , long afterwards , thought it worth while to express in verse the sensations which she had excited , and which then remained as vividly in his mind as at the moment when we lost sight of Jedburgh . ”</p>

     <p>“ Could you furnish me , by application to any of your Gaelic friends , a phrase in that language which could take its place in the following verse of eight syllables , and have the following meaning . ”</p>
     <p>He adds ,</p>
     <p>“ The above is part of a little poem which I have written on a Highland story told me by an eye-witness ... ”</p>
     <p>This is the nearest clue we have to the date of the composition of the poem .— Ed . ]</p>
     <p>It is recorded in Dampier 's Voyages that a Boy , the Son of a Captain of a Man of War , seated himself in a Turtle-shell and floated in it from the shore to his Father 's Ship , which lay at anchor at the distance of half a mile . Upon the suggestion of a Friend , I have substituted such a Shell for that less elegant vessel in which my blind voyager did actually intrust himself to the dangerous current of Loch Levin , as was related to me by an Eye-witness .— W . W. 1815 .</p>
     <p>This note varies slightly in later editions .</p>
     <p>The Loch Leven referred to is a sea-loch in Argyllshire , into which the tidal water flows with some force from Loch Linnhe at Ballachulish .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">‘ By night and day</l>
       <l n="2">The great Sea-water finds its way</l>
       <l n="3">Through long , long windings of the hills . ’</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The friend referred to in the note of 1815 , who urged Wordsworth to give his blind voyager a Shell , instead of a washing-tub to sail in , was Coleridge . The original tale of the tub was not more unfortunate than the lines in praise of Wilkinson 's spade , and several of Wordsworth 's friends , notably Charles Lamb and Barren Field , objected to the change . Lamb wrote to Wordsworth in 1815 ,</p>
     <p>“ I am afraid lest that substitution of a shell ( a flat falsification of the history ) for the household implement , as it stood at first , was a kind of tub thrown out to the beast ” [ i. e. the reviewer ! ] “ or rather thrown out for him . The tub was a good honest tub in its place , and nothing could fairly be said against it . You say you made the alteration for the ‘ friendly reader , ’ but the ‘ malicious ’ will take it to himself . ”</p>
     <p>( ‘ The Letters of Charles Lamb ’ , edited by Alfred Ainger , vol . i. p . 283 . ) Wordsworth could not be induced to “ undo his work , ” and go back to his own original ; although he evidently agreed with what Lamb had said ( as is seen in a letter to Barren Field , Oct. 24 , 1828 ) .— Ed .</p>

     <p>“ Thursday , September 8th .— Before breakfast we walked to the Pass of Killicrankie . A very fine scene ; the river Garry forcing its way down a deep chasm between rocks , at the foot of high rugged hills covered with wood , to a great height . The pass did not , however , impress us with awe , or a sensation of difficulty or danger , according to our expectations ; but , the road being at a considerable height on the side of the hill , we at first only looked into the dell or chasm . It is much grander seen from below , near the river 's bed . Everybody knows that this Pass is famous in military history . When we were travelling in Scotland , an invasion was hourly looked for , and one could not but think with some regret of the times when , from the now depopulated Highlands forty or fifty thousand men might have been poured down for the defence of the country , under such leaders as the Marquis of Montrose or the brave man who had so distinguished himself upon the ground where we were standing . I will transcribe a sonnet suggested to William by this place , and written in Oct. 1803 . ”</p>

     <p>This sonnet , as the title indicates , does not refer to an actual victory ; because , since the Norman conquest , no “ Invaders ” have ever set foot “ on British ground . ” It was written — like the two preceding sonnets , and the one that follows it — “ in anticipation ” of Napoleon 's project for the invasion of England being actually carried out ; a project never realised . The assembling of the immense French army destined for this purpose — one of the finest brought together since the days of the Roman legions — between the mouths of the Seine and the Texel , roused the spirit of English patriotism as it had never been roused before . Three hundred thousand volunteers were enlisted in Great Britain by the 10th of August 1803 ;</p>
     <p>“ all the male population of the kingdom from seventeen years of age to fifty-five were divided into classes to be successively armed and exercised ” ( Dyer ) .</p>
     <p>The story of the failure of Napoleon 's scheme is too well known to be repeated in this note . Wordsworth seems to have written his sonnet in anticipation of what he believed would have been the inevitable issue of events , had the French army actually landed on British soil .— Ed .</p>
