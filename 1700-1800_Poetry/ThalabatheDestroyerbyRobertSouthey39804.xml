    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">In the continuation of the Arabian Tales , the Domdaniel is mentioned ; a Seminary for evil Magicians under the Roots of the Sea . From this seed the present Romance has grown . Let me not be supposed to prefer the metre in which it is written , abstractedly considered , to the regular blank verse ; the noblest measure , in my judgement , of which our admirable language is capable . For the following Poem I have preferred it , because it suits the varied subject ; it is the Arabesque ornament of an Arabian tale .</p>
    <p n="2">The dramatic sketches of Dr. Sayer , a volume which no lover of poetry will recollect without pleasure , induced me when a young versifier , to practise in this metre . I felt that while it gave the poet a wider range of expression , it satisfied the ear of the reader . It were easy to make a parade of learning by enumerating the various feet which it admits ; it is only needful to observe that no two lines are employed in sequence which can be read into one . Two six-syllable lines ( it will perhaps be answered ) compose an Alexandrine : the truth is that the Alexandrine , when harmonious , is composed of two six-syllable lines .</p>
    <p n="3">One advantage this metre assuredly possesses ; the dullest reader cannot distort it into discord : he may read it with a prose mouth , but its flow and fall will still be perceptible . Verse is not enough favoured by the English reader : perhaps this is owing to the obtrusiveness , the regular Jews-harp twing-twang , of what has been foolishly called heroic measure . I do not wish the improvisatore tune , but something that denotes the sense of harmony , something like the accent of feeling ; like the tone which every Poet necessarily gives to Poetry .</p>

     <l n="1">How beautiful is night !</l>
     <l n="2">A dewy freshness fills the silent air ,</l>
     <l n="3">No mist obscures , no little cloud</l>
     <l n="4">Breaks the whole serene of heaven :</l>
     <l n="5">In full-orbed glory the majestic moon</l>
     <l n="6">Rolls thro the dark blue depths .</l>
     <l n="7">Beneath her steady ray</l>
     <l n="8">The desert circle spreads ,</l>
     <l n="9">Like the round ocean , girdled with the sky .</l>

     <l n="11">Who at this untimely hour</l>

     <l n="13">No station is in view ,</l>
     <l n="14">No palm-grove islanded amid the waste .</l>
     <l n="15">The mother and her child ,</l>
     <l n="16">The widow and the orphan at this hour</l>
     <l n="17">Wander o'er the desert sands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">Alas ! the setting sun</l>
     <l n="19">Saw Zeinab in her bliss ,</l>
     <l n="20">Hodeirah 's wife beloved .</l>
     <l n="21">Alas ! the wife beloved ,</l>
     <l n="22">The fruitful mother late ,</l>
     <l n="23">Whom when the daughters of Arabia named</l>
     <l n="24">They wished their lot like her 's ;</l>
     <l n="25">She wanders o'er the desert sands</l>
     <l n="26">A wretched widow now ,</l>
     <l n="27">The fruitful mother of so fair a race ,</l>
     <l n="28">With only one preserved ,</l>
     <l n="29">She wanders o'er the wilderness .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="30">No tear relieved the burthen of her heart ;</l>
     <l n="31">Stunned with the heavy woe she felt like one</l>
     <l n="32">Half-wakened from a midnight dream of blood .</l>
     <l n="33">But sometimes when her boy</l>
     <l n="34">Would wet her hand with tears ,</l>
     <l n="35">And looking up to her fixed countenance ,</l>
     <l n="36">Amid his bursting sobs</l>
     <l n="37">Say the dear name of MOTHER , then would she</l>
     <l n="38">Utter a feeble groan .</l>
     <l n="39">At length collecting , Zeinab turned her eyes</l>
     <l n="40">To heaven , exclaiming , “ praised be the Lord !</l>
     <l n="41">“ He gave ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>he takes away ,</l>
     <l n="42">“ The Lord our God is good ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="43">“ Good is he ? ” cried the boy ,</l>
     <l n="44">“ Why are my brethren and my sisters slain ?</l>
     <l n="45">“ Why is my father killed ?</l>
     <l n="46">“ Did ever we neglect our prayers ,</l>
     <l n="47">“ Or ever lift a hand unclean to heaven ?</l>
     <l n="48">“ Did ever stranger from our tent</l>
     <l n="49">“ Unwelcomed turn away ?</l>
     <l n="50">“ Mother , he is not good ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="51">Then Zeinab beat her breast in agony ,</l>
     <l n="52">“ O God forgive my child !</l>
     <l n="53">“ He knows not what he says !</l>
     <l n="54">“ Thou know'st I did not teach him thoughts like these ,</l>
     <l n="55">“ O Prophet , pardon him ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="56">She had not wept till that assuaging prayer ....</l>
     <l n="57">The fountains of her eyes were opened then ,</l>
     <l n="58">And tears relieved her heart .</l>
     <l n="59">She raised her swimming eyes to Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="60">“ Allah , thy will be done !</l>
     <l n="61">“ Beneath the dispensation of thy wrath</l>
     <l n="62">“ I groan , but murmur not .</l>
     <l n="63">“ The Day of the Trial will come ,</l>
     <l n="64">“ When I shall understand how profitable</l>
     <l n="65">“ It is to suffer now . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="66">Young Thalaba in silence heard reproof ,</l>
     <l n="67">His brow in manly frowns was knit ,</l>
     <l n="68">With manly thoughts his heart was full .</l>
     <l n="69">“ Tell me who slew my father ? ” cried the boy .</l>
     <l n="70">Zeinab replied and said ,</l>
     <l n="71">“ I knew not that there lived thy father 's foe .</l>
     <l n="72">“ The blessings of the poor for him</l>
     <l n="73">“ Went daily up to Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="74">“ In distant lands the traveller told his praise .</l>
     <l n="75">“ I did not think there lived</l>
     <l n="76">“ Hodeirah 's enemy . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="77">“ But I will hunt him thro ’ the earth ! ”</l>
     <l n="78">Young Thalaba exclaimed .</l>
     <l n="79">“ Already I can bend my father 's bow ,</l>
     <l n="80">“ Soon will my arm have strength</l>
     <l n="81">“ To drive the arrow-feathers to his heart . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="82">Zeinab replied , “ O Thalaba , my child ,</l>
     <l n="83">“ Thou lookest on to distant days ,</l>
     <l n="84">“ And we are in the desert far from men ! ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="85">Not till that moment her afflicted heart</l>
     <l n="86">Had leisure for the thought .</l>
     <l n="87">She cast her eyes around ,</l>
     <l n="88">Alas ! no tents were there</l>
     <l n="89">Beside the bending sands ;</l>
     <l n="90">No palm tree rose to spot the wilderness .</l>
     <l n="91">The dark blue sky closed round</l>
     <l n="92">And rested<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>like a dome</l>
     <l n="93">Upon the circling waste .</l>
     <l n="94">She cast her eyes around ,</l>
     <l n="95">Famine and Thirst were there .</l>
     <l n="96">Then the mother bowed her head ,</l>
     <l n="97">And wept upon her child .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="98">... Sudden a cry of wonder</l>
     <l n="99">From Thalaba aroused her ,</l>
     <l n="100">She raised her head , and saw</l>
     <l n="101">Where high in air a stately palace rose .</l>
     <l n="102">Amid a grove embowered</l>
     <l n="103">Stood the prodigious pile ,</l>
     <l n="104">Trees of such ancient majesty</l>
     <l n="105">Towered not on Yemen 's happy hills ,</l>
     <l n="106">Nor crowned the stately brow of Lebanon .</l>
     <l n="107">Fabric so vast , so lavishly enriched ,</l>
     <l n="108">For Idol , or for Tyrant , never yet</l>
     <l n="109">Raised the slave race of men</l>
     <l n="110">In Rome , nor in the elder Babylon ,</l>
     <l n="111">Nor old Persepolis ,</l>
     <l n="112">Nor where the family of Greece</l>
     <l n="113">Hymned Eleutherian Jove .</l>
     <l n="114">Here studding azure<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>tablatures</l>
     <l n="115">And rayed with feeble light ,</l>
     <l n="116">Star-like the ruby and the diamond shone :</l>
     <l n="117">Here on the golden towers</l>
     <l n="118">The yellow moon-beam lay ;</l>
     <l n="119">Here with white splendour floods the silver wall .</l>
     <l n="120">Less wonderous pile and less magnificent</l>

     <l n="123">And made its colours , like the serpents skin</l>
     <l n="124">Play with a changeful beauty : him , its Lord</l>
     <l n="125">Jealous lest after-effort might surpass</l>
     <l n="126">The now unequalled palace , from its height</l>
     <l n="127">Dashed on the pavement down .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="128">They entered , and through aromatic paths</l>
     <l n="129">Wondering they went along .</l>
     <l n="130">At length upon a mossy bank</l>
     <l n="131">Beneath a tall mimosa 's shade</l>
     <l n="132">That o'er him bent its living canopy ,</l>
     <l n="133">They saw a man reclined .</l>
     <l n="134">Young he appeared , for on his cheek there shone</l>
     <l n="135">The morning glow of health ,</l>
     <l n="136">And the brown beard curled close around his chin .</l>
     <l n="137">He slept , but at the sound</l>
     <l n="138">Of coming feet awakening , fixed his eyes</l>
     <l n="139">In wonder , on the wanderer and her child .</l>
     <l n="140">“ Forgive us , ” Zeinab cried ,</l>
     <l n="141">“ Distress hath made us bold .</l>
     <l n="142">“ Relieve the widow and the fatherless .</l>
     <l n="143">“ Blessed are they who succour the distrest</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="145">He heard , and he looked up to heaven ,</l>
     <l n="146">And tears ran down his cheeks :</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="16">
     <l n="164">Fearless , and scarce surprized ,</l>
     <l n="165">For grief in Zeinab 's soul</l>
     <l n="166">All other feebler feelings overpowered ,</l>
     <l n="167">She answered , “ Yesterday</l>

   <p>I have placed a scripture phrase in the mouth of a Mohammedan ; but it is a saying of Job , and there can be no impropriety in making a modern Arab speak like an ancient one . Resignation is particularly inculcated by Mohammed , and of all his precepts it is that which his followers have best observed : it is even the vice of the East . It had been easy to have made Zeinab speak from the Koran , if the tame language of the Koran could be remembered by the few who have toiled through its dull tautology . I thought it better to express a feeling of religion in that language with which our religious ideas are connected .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>The magnificent Mosque Tauris is faced with varnished bricks of various colours , like most fine buildings in Persia , says Tavernier . One of its domes is covered with white flower work upon a green ground , the other has a black ground , spotted with white stars . Gilding is also common upon Oriental buildings . At Boghar in Bactria our old traveller Jenkinson [ a ] saw “ many houses , temples , and monuments of stone sumptuously builded and gilt . ”</p>

   <p>In Pegu “ they consume about their Varely or idol houses great store of leafe-gold , for that they overlay all the tops of the houses with gold , and some of them are covered with gold from the top to the foote ; in covering whereof there is great store of gold spent , for that every ten years they new overlay them with gold , from the top to the foote , so that with this vanetie they spend great aboundance of golde . For every ten years the rain doeth consume the gold from these houses . ”</p>
   <p>Caesar Frederick , in Hakluyt .</p>
   <p>A waste of ornament and labour characterises all the works of the Orientalists . I have seen illuminated Persian manuscripts that must each have been the toil of many years , every page painted , not with representations of life and manners , but usually like the curves and lines of a Turkey carpet , conveying no idea whatever , as absurd to the eye as nonsense-verses to the ear . The little of their literature that has reached us is equally worthless . Our barbarian scholars have called Ferdusi the Oriental Homer . We have a specimen of his poem ; the translation is said to be bad , and certainly must be unfaithful , for it is in rhyme ; but the vilest copy of a picture at least represents the subject and the composition . To make this Iliad of the East , as they have sacrilegiously stiled it , a good poem , would be realizing the dreams of Alchemy , and transmuting lead into gold .</p>
   <p>The Arabian Tales certainly abound with genius ; they have lost their metaphorical rubbish in passing through the filter of a French translation .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>The Arabians call this palace one of the wonders of the world . It was built for Noman-al-Aouar , one of those Arabian Kings who reigned at Hirah . A single stone fastened the whole structure ; the colour of the walls varied frequently in a day . Noman richly rewarded the architect Sennamar ; but recollecting afterwards that he might build palaces equal , or superior in beauty for his rival kings , ordered that he should be thrown from the highest tower of the edifice .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>The tribe of Ad were descended from Ad , the son of Aus or Uz , the son of Irem , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , who after the confusion of tongues , settled in Al Ahkaf , or the winding sands , in the province of Hadramaut , where his posterity greatly multiplied . Their first King was Shedad , the son of Ad , of whom the eastern writers deliver many fabulous things , particularly that he finished the magnificent city his father had begun , wherein he built a fine palace , adorned with delicious gardens , to embellish which he spared neither cost nor labour , proposing thereby to create in his subjects a superstitious veneration of himself as a God . This garden or paradise was called the garden of Irem , and is mentioned in the Koran , and often alluded to by the Oriental writers . The city they tell us , is still standing in the desarts of Aden , being preserved by providence as a monument of divine justice , though it be invisible , unless very rarely , when God permits it to be seen : a favour one Colabah pretended to have received in the reign of the Khalif Moawiyah , who sending for him to know the truth of the matter , Colabah related his whole adventure ; that is he was seeking a Camel he had lost , he found himself on a sudden at the gates of this city , and entering it , saw not one inhabitant , at which being terrified , he stayed no longer than to take with him some fine stones which he shewed the Khalif .</p>
   <p>Sale .</p>
   <p>The descendants of Ad in process of time falling from the worship of the true God into idolatry , God sent the prophet Houd ( who is generally agreed to be Heber ) to preach the unity of his essence and reclaim them . Houd preached for many years to this people without effect , till God at last was weary of waiting for their repentance . The first punishment which he inflicted was a famine of three years continuance , during all which time the heavens were closed upon them . This , with the evils which it caused , destroyed a great part of this people , who were then the richest and most powerful of all in Arabia .</p>
   <p>The Adites seeing themselves reduced to this extremity , and receiving no succour from their false Gods , resolved to make a pilgrimage to a place in the province of Hegiaz , where at present Mecca is situated . There was then a hillock of red sand there , around which a great concourse of different people might always be seen ; and all these nations , the faithful as well as the unfaithful , believed that by visiting this spot with devotion , they should obtain from God whatever they petitioned for , respecting the wants and necessities of life .</p>
   <p>The Adites having then resolved to undertake this religious journey , chose seventy men , at whose head they appointed Mortadh and Kail , the two most considerable personages of the country , to perform this duty in the name of the whole nation , and by this means procure rain from Heaven , without which their country must be ruined . The deputees departed , and were hospitably received by Moawiyah , who at that time reigned in the province of Hegiaz . They explained to him the occasion of their journey , and demanded leave to proceed and perform their devotions at the Red Hillock , that they might procure rain .</p>
   <p>Mortadh , who was the wisest of this company , and who had been converted by the Prophet Houd , often remonstrated with his associates that it was useless to to take this journey for the purpose of praying at this chosen spot , unless they had previously adopted the truths which the Prophet preached , and seriously repented of their unbelief . For how , said he , can you hope that God will shed upon us the abundant showers of his mercy , if we refuse to hear the voice of him whom he hath sent to instruct us ?</p>
   <p>Kail who was one of the most obstinate in error , and consequently of the Prophets worst enemies , hearing the discourses of his colleague , requested King Moawiyah to detain Mortadh prisoner , whilst he and the remainder of his companions proceeded to make their prayers upon the Hillock . Moawiyah consented , and detaining Mortadh captive , permitted the others to pursue their journey and accomplish their vow .</p>
   <p>Kail , now the sole chief of the deputation , having arrived at the place , prayed thus , Lord give to the people of Ad such rains as it shall please thee . And he had scarcely finished when there appeared three clouds in the sky , one white , one red , the third black . At the same time these words were heard to proceed from Heaven , chuse which of the three thou wilt . Kail chose the black , which he imagined the fullest , and most abundant in water , of which they were in extreme want . After having chosen , he immediately quitted the place and took the road to his own country , congratulating himself on the happy success of his pilgrimage .</p>
   <p>As soon as Kail arrived in the valley of Magaith , a part of the territory of the Adites , he informed his countrymen of the favourable answer he had received , and of the cloud which was soon to water all their lands . The senseless people all came out of their houses to receive it , but this cloud , which was big with the divine vengeance produced only a wind , most cold and most violent , which the Arabs call Sarsar ; it continued to blow for seven days and seven nights , and exterminated all the unbelievers of the country , leaving only the Prophet Houd alive , and those who had heard him and turned to the faith .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>Concerning the Pyramids , “ I shall put down , says Greaves , that which is confessed by the Arabian writers to be the most probable relation , as is reported by Ibn Abd Alhokm , whose words out of the Arabick are these . “ The greatest part of chronologers agree , that he which built the Pyramids , was , Saurid Ibn Salhouk , King of Egypt , who lived three hundred years before the flood . The occasion of this was , because he saw in his sleep , that the whole earth was turned over with the inhabitants of it , the men lying upon their faces , and the stars falling down and striking one another , with a terrible noise ; and being troubled , he concealed it . After this he saw the fixed stars falling to the earth , in the similitude of white fowl , and they snatched up men , carrying them between two great mountains ; and these mountains closed upon them , and the shining stars were made dark . Awaking with great fear , he assembles the chief priests of all the provinces of Egypt , an hundred and thirty priests , the chief of them was called Aclimum . Relating the whole matter to them , they took the altitude of the stars , and making their prognostication , foretold of a deluge . The King said , will it come to our country ? they answered , yea , and will destroy it . And there remained a certain number of years for to come , and he commanded in the mean space to build the Pyramids , and a vault to be made , into which the river Nilus entering should run into the countries of the west , and into the land Al-Said . And he filled them with telesmes , [ b ] and with strange things , and with riches and treasures and the like . He engraved in them all things that were told him by wise men , as also all profound sciences , the names of alakakirs , [ c ] the uses and hurts of them ; the science of astrology and of arithmetick , and of geometry , and of physick . All this may be interpreted by him that knows their characters and language . After he had given order for this building , they cut out vast columns and wonderful stones . They fetch massy stones from the AEthopians , and made with these the foundation of the three Pyramids , fastening them together with lead and iron . They built the gates of them forty cubits under ground , and they made the height of the Pyramids one hundred royal cubits , which are fifty of ours in these times ; he also made each side of them an hundred royal cubits . The beginning of this building was in a fortunate horoscope . After that he had finished it , he covered it with coloured satten from the top to the bottom ; and he appointed a solemn festival , at which were present all the inhabitants of his kingdom . Then he built in the western Pyramid thirty treasures , filled with store of riches , and utensils , and with signatures made of precious stones , and with instruments of iron , and vessels of earth , and with arms that rust not , and with glass which might be bended and yet not broken , and with several kind of alakakirs , single and double , and with deadly poisons , and with other things besides . He made also in the east Pyramid divers celestial spheres and stars , and what they severally operate in their aspects , and the perfumes which are to be used to them , and the books which treat of these matters . He also put in the coloured Pyramid the commentaries of the Priests , in chests of black marble , and with every Priest a book , in which were the wonders of his profession , and of his actions , and of his nature , and what was done in his time , and what is , and what shall be , from the beginning of time to the end of it . He placed in every Pyramid a treasurer . The treasurer of the westerly Pyramid was a statue of marble stone , standing upright with a lance , and upon his head a serpent wreathed . He that came near it , and stood still , the serpent bit him of one side , and wreathing round about his throat and killing him , returned to his place . He made the treasurer of the east Pyramid , an idol of black agate , his eyes open and shining , sitting upon a throne with a lance ; when any looked upon him , he heard of one side of him a voice , which took away his sense , so that he fell prostrate upon his face , and ceased not till he died . He made the treasurer of the coloured Pyramid a statue of stone , called Albut , sitting : he which looked towards it was drawn by the statue , till he stuck to it , and could not be separated from it , till such time as he died . The Coptites write in their books , that there is an inscription engraven upon them , the exposition of which in Arabick is this , I KING SAURID built the Pyramids in such and such a time , and finished them in six years : he that comes after me , and says that he is equal to me , let him destroy them in six hundred years ; and yet it is known , that it is easier to pluck down , than to build up : I also covered them , when I had finished them , with satten ; and let him cover them with mats . After that ALMAMON the Calif entered AEgypt , and saw the Pyramids . He desired to know what was within , and therefore would have them opened . They told him it could not possibly be done . He replied I will have it certainly done . And that hole was opened for him , which stands open to this day , with fire and vinegar . Two smiths prepared and sharpened the iron and engines , which they forced in , and there was a great expence in the opening of it . The thickness of the wall was found to be twenty cubits ; and when they came to the end of the wall , behind the place they had digged , there was an ewer of green emerald ; in it were a thousand dinars very weighty , every dinar was an ounce of our ounces : they wondered at it , but knew not the meaning of it . Then ALMAMON said , cast up the account , how much hath been spent in making the entrance ; they cast it up , and lo it was the same sum which they found , it neither exceeded nor was defective . Within they found a square well , in the square of it there were doors , every door opened into a house ( or vault ) in which there were dead bodies wrapped up in linen . They found towards the top of the Pyramid , a chamber , in which there was an hollow stone : in it was a statue of stone like a man , and within it a man , upon whom was a breast-plate of gold set with jewels ; upon his breast was a sword of invaluable price , and at his head a carbuncle of the bigness of an egg , shining like the light of the day ; and upon him were characters written with a pen , no man knows what they signify . After ALMAMON had opened it , men entered into it for many years , and descended by the slippery passage which is in it ; and some of them came out safe , and others died . ”</p>

   <p>[ c ] Alakakir , amongst other significations , is the name of a precious stone ; and therefore in Abulfeda it is joined with yacut , a ruby . I imagine it here to signify some magical spell , which it may be was engraven on this stone .</p>

   <p>“ Whilst the King was at Bologna a stone wonderful in its species and nature was brought to him from the East Indies , by a man unknown , who appeared by his manners to be a Barbarian . It sparkled as tho ’ all burning with an incredible splendour , flashing radiance , and shooting on every side its beams , it filled the surrounding air to a great distance with a light scarcely by any eyes endurable . In this also it was wonderful , that being most impatient of the earth , if it was confined , it would force its way and immediately fly aloft ; neither could it be contained by any art of man in a narrow place , but appeared only to love those of ample extent . It was of the utmost purity stained by no soil nor spot . Certain shape it had none , for its figure was inconstant and momentarily changing , and tho ’ at a distance it was beautiful to the eye , it would not suffer itself to be handled with impunity , but hurt those who obstinately struggled with it , as many persons before many spectators experienced . If by chance any part of it was broken off , for it was not very hard , it become nothing less .</p>

   <p>In the Mirror of Stones , Carbuncles are said to be male and female . The females throw out their brightness : the stars appear burning within the males .</p>

   <p>A pleasant and elevated spot being fixed upon , Shuddaud dispatched an hundred chiefs to collect skilful artists and workmen from all countries . He also commanded the monarchs of Syria and Ormus to send him all their jewels and precious stones . Forty camel loads of gold , silver , and jewels , were daily used in the building , which contained a thousand spacious quadrangles of many thousand rooms . In the areas were artificial trees of gold and silver , whose leaves were emeralds , and fruit clusters of pearls and jewels . The ground was strewed with ambergris , musk , and saffron . Between every two of the artificial trees was planted one of delicious fruit . This romantic abode took up five hundred years in the completion . When finished , Shuddaud marched to view it ; and , when arrived near , divided two hundred thousand youthful slaves , whom he had brought with him from Damascus , into four detachments , which were stationed in cantonments prepared for their reception on each side of the garden , towards which he proceeded with his favourite courtiers .

All the guests contented themselves with expressing their admiration , and lavishing praise , except one , who led a retired and austere life , and was one of those persons whom the Arabians call Zahed .</p>
   <p>This man spoke very freely to the Prince and said to him , I find a great defect in this building , it is , that the foundation is not good , nor the walls sufficiently strong , so that Azrael can enter on every side , and the Sarsar can easily pass thro ’ . And when they showed him the walls of the Palace ornamented with azure and gold , of which the marvellous workmanship surpassed in costliness the richness of the materials , he replied , there is still a great inconvenience here ! it is that we can never estimate these works well , till we are laid backwards . Signifying by these words that we never understand these things rightly , till we are upon our death-bed , when we discover their vanity .</p>

   <p>A curious instance of French taste occurs in this part of Brebeuf 's translation . The re-animated corpse is made the corpse of Burrhus , of whose wife Octavia Sextus is enamoured . Octavia hears that her husband has fallen in battle , she seeks his body , but in vain . A light at length leads her to the scene of Erichtho 's incantations , and she beholds Burrhus , to all appearance living . The witch humanely allows them time for a long conversation , which is very complimentary on the part of the husband .</p>
   <p>Brebeuf was a man of genius . The Pharsalia is as well told in his version as it can be in the detestable French heroic couplet , which epigrammatizes every thing .

     <l n="1">The Arabs of the desert call these winds Semoum or poison , and the</l>
     <l n="2">Turks Shamyela , or wind of Syria , from which is formed the Samiel .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Their heat is sometimes so excessive that it is difficult to form any idea of its violence without having experienced it ; but it may be compared to the heat of a large oven at the moment of drawing out the bread . When these winds begin to blow , the atmosphere assumes an alarming aspect . The sky at other times so clear , in this climate , becomes dark and heavy ; the sun loses his splendour and appears of a violet colour . The air is not cloudy , but grey and thick , and is in fact filled with an extremely subtile dust , which penetrates every where . This wind , always light and rapid , is not at first remarkably hot , but it increases in heat in proportion as it continues . All animated bodies soon discover it , by the change it produces in them . The lungs which a too rarefied air no longer expands , are contracted and become painful . Respiration is short and difficult , the skin parched and dry , and the body consumed by an internal heat . In vain is recourse had to large draughts of water ; nothing can restore perspiration . In vain is coolness sought for ; all bodies in which it is usual to find it , deceives the hand that touches them . Marble , iron , water , notwithstanding the sun no longer appears , are hot . The streets are deserted , and the dead silence of night reigns every where . The inhabitants of houses and villages shut themselves up in their houses , and those of the desert in their tents , or in pits they dig in the earth , where they wait the termination of this destructive heat . It usually lasts three days , but if it exceeds that time it becomes insupportable . Woe to the traveller whom this wind surprizes remote from shelter ! he must suffer all its dreadful consequences which sometimes are mortal . The danger is most imminent when it blows in squalls , for then the rapidity of the wind increases the heat to such degree as to cause sudden death . This death is a real suffocation ; the lungs being empty , are convulsed , the circulation disordered , and the whole mass of blood driven by the heart towards the head and breast ; whence that haemorrhage at the nose and mouth which happens after death . This wind is especially fatal to persons of a plethoric habit , and those in whom fatigue has destroyed the tone of the muscles and the vessels . The corpse remains a long time warm , swells , turns blue and is easily separated ; all which are signs of that putrid fermentation which takes place in animal bodies when the humours become stagnant . These accidents are to be avoided by stopping the nose and mouth with handkerchiefs ; an efficacious method likewise is that practised by the camels , who bury their noses in the sand and keep them there till the squall is over .</p>
   <p>Another quality of this wind is its extreme aridity ; which is such , that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates in a few minutes . By this extreme dryness it withers and strips all the plants , and by exhaling too suddenly the emanations from animal bodies , crisps the skin , closes the pores , and causes that feverish heat which is the invariable effect of suppressed perspiration .</p>

   <p>The Amethyst drives away drunkenness ; for being bound on the navel , it restrains the vapour of the wine , and so disolves the ebriety .</p>
   <p>Alectoria is a stone of a christalline colour , a little darkish , somewhat resembling limpid water ; and sometimes it has veins of the colour of flesh . Some call it Gallinaceus , from the place of its generation , the intestines of capons , which were castrated at three years old , and had lived seven , before which time the stone ought not to be taken out , for the older it is , so much the better . When the stone is become perfect in the Capon , he do'nt drink . However tis never found bigger than a large bean . The virtue of this stone is to render him who carries it invisible , being held in the mouth it allays thirst , and therefore is proper for wrestlers ; makes a woman agreable to her husband ; bestows honors and preserves those already acquired ; it frees such as are bewitched ; it renders a man eloquent , constant , agreable and amiable ; it helps to regain a lost Kingdom , and acquire a foreign one .</p>
   <p>Borax , Nosa , Crapondinus , are names of the same stone , which is extracted from a toad . There are two species ; that which is the best is rarely found ; the other is black or dun with a cerluean glow , having in the middle the similitude of an eye , and must be taken out while the dead toad is yet panting , and these are better than those which are extracted from it after a long continuance in the ground . They have a wonderful efficacy in poisons . For whoever has taken poison , let him swallow this ; which being down , rolls about the bowels , and drives out every poisonous quality that is lodged in the intestines , and then passes thro ’ the fundament , and is preserved .</p>
   <p>Corvia or Corvina , is a Stone of a reddish colour , and accounted artificial . On the calends of April boil the eggs taken out of a Crow 's nest till they are hard : and being cold let them be placed in the nest as they were before . When the crow knows this , she flies a long way to find the stone , and having found it returns to the nest , and the eggs being touched with it , they become fresh and prolific , the Stone must immediately be snatched out of the nest , its virtue is to increase riches , to bestow honors , and to foretell many future events .</p>

   <p>In supernatural affairs dogs seem to possess a sedative virtue . When peace was made , about the year 1170 , between the Earls of Holland , and Flanders , “ it was concluded that Count Floris should send unto Count Philip , a thousand men , expert in making of ditches , to stop the hole which had beene made neere unto Dam , or the Sluce , whereby the countrey was drowned round about at everie high sea ; the which the Flemings could by no meanes fil up , neither with wood , nor any other matter , for that all sunke as in a gulfe without any bottome ; whereby , in succession of time , Bruges and all that jurisdiction , had been in danger to have bin lost by inundation , and to become all sea , if it were not speedily repaired . Count Floris having taken possession of the isle of Walchran , returned into Holland , from whence hee sent the best workmen he could find in all his countries , into Flanders , to make dikes and causeies , and to stop the hole neere unto this Dam , or Sluce , and to recover the drowned land . These diggers being come to the place , they found at the entrie of this bottomlesse hole a Sea-dog , the which for six dayes together , did nothing but crie out and howle very fearefully . They , not knowing what it might signifie , having consulted of this accident , they resolved to cast this dogge into the hole . There was a mad-headed Hollander among the rest , who going into the bottome of the dike , tooke the dogge by the taile , and cast him into the middest of the gulfe ; then speedily they cast earth and torfe into it , so as they found a bottome , and by little and little filled it up . And for that many workemen came to the repairing of this dike , who for that they would not be far from their worke , coucht in Cabines , which seemed to be a pretie towne . Count Philip gave unto all these Hollanders , Zeelanders and others , that would inhabit there , as much land as they could recover from Dam to Ardenbourg , for them and their successors , for ever , with many other immunities and freedoms . By reason whereof many planted themselves there , and in succession of time , made a good towne there , the which by reason of this dog , which they cast into the hole , they named Hondtsdam , that is to say , a dog 's sluce ; Dam in Flemish signifying a sluce , and Hondt a dog : and therefore at this day , the said towne ( which is simply called Dam ) carrieth a dog in their armes and blason .</p>

The shepherds , mule drivers , camel drivers , and travellers , gather the leaves , of which they make mats , fringes , baskets , hats , shooaris or large wallets to carry corn , twine , ropes , girths and covers for their pack saddles . This plant , with which also they heat their ovens , produces a mild and resinous fruit , that ripens in Sept. and Oct . It is in form like the raisin , contains a kernel and is astringent , and very proper to temper and counteract the effects of the watery and laxative fruits , of which these people in summer make an immoderate use . That Power which is ever provident to all , has spread this wild plant over their deserts to supply an infinity of wants that would otherwise heavily burthen a people so poor .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span>The simplicity , or , perhaps , more properly , the poverty , of the lower class of the Bedouins , is proportionate to that of their chiefs . All the wealth of a family consists of moveables , of which the following is a pretty exact inventory . A few male and female camels , some goats and poultry , a mare and her bridle and saddle , a tent , a lance sixteen feet long , a crooked sabre , a rusty musket , with a flint or matchlock ; a pipe , a portable mill , a pot for cooking , a leathern bucket , a small coffee roaster , a mat , some clothes , a mantle of black woollen , and a few glass or silver rings , which the women wear upon their legs and arms ; if none of these are wanting , their furniture is complete . But what the poor man stands most in need of , and what he takes most pleasure in , is his mare ; for this animal is his principal support . With his mare the Bedouin makes his excursions against hostile tribes , or seeks plunder in the country , and on the highways . The mare is preferred to the horse , because she does not neigh , is more docile , and yields milk , which on occasion , satisfies the thirst and even the hunger of her master .</p>
   <p>Volney .</p>
   <p>The Shaik , says Volney , with whom I resided in the country of Gaza , about the end of 1784 , passed for one of the most powerful of those districts ; yet it did not appear to me that his expenditure was greater than that of an opulent farmer . His personal effects , consisting in a few pelisses , carpets , arms , horses , and camels , could not be estimated at more than fifty thousand livres ( a little above two thousand pounds ) ; and it must be observed that in this calculation four mares of the breed of racers are valued at six thousand livres , ( two hundred and fifty pounds ) , and each camel at ten pounds sterling . We must not therefore , when we speak of the Bedouins , affix to the words Prince and Lord , the ideas they usually convey ; we should come nearer the truth by comparing them to substantial farmers , in mountainous countries , whose simplicity they resemble in their dress as well as in their domestic life and manners . A Shaik , who has the command of five hundred horse , does not disdain to saddle and bridle his own , nor to give him his barley and chopped straw . In his tent , his wife makes the coffee , kneeds the dough , and superintends the dressing of the victuals . His daughters and kinswomen wash the linen , and go with pitchers on their heads , and veils over their faces , to draw water from the fountain . These manners agree precisely with the descriptions in Homer , and the history of Abraham , in Genesis . But it must be owned that it is difficult to form a just idea of them without having ourselves been eye witnesses .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>Thus confined to the most absolute necessaries of life , the Arabs have as little industry as their wants are few ; all their arts consist in weaving their clumsy tents , and in making mats and butter . Their whole commerce only extends to the exchanging camels , kids , stallions and milk ; for arms , clothing , a little rice or corn , and money , which they bury .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span>I was much amused by observing the dexterity of the Arab women in baking their bread . They have a small place built with clay , between two and three feet high , having a hole at the bottom , for the convenience of drawing out the ashes , something similar to that of a lime kiln . The oven ( which I think is the most proper name for this place ) is usually about fifteen inches wide at the top , and gradually grows wider to the bottom . It is heated with wood , and when sufficiently hot , and perfectly clear from smoke , having nothing but clear embers at bottom ( which continue to reflect great heat ) , they prepare the dough in a large bowl , and mould the cakes to the desired size on a board or stone placed near the oven . After they have kneaded the cake to a proper consistence , they pat it a little , then toss it about with great dexterity in one hand , till it is as thin as they choose to make it . They then wet one side of it with water , at the same time wetting the hand and arm , with which they put it into the oven . The wet side of the cake adheres fast to the side of the oven till it is sufficiently baked when if not paid sufficient attention to , it would fall down among the embers . If they were not exceedingly quick at this work , the heat of the oven would burn the skin from off their hands and arms ; but with such amazing dexterity do they perform it , that one woman will continue keeping three or four cakes at a time in the oven till she has done baking . This mode , let me add , does not require half the fuel that is made use of in Europe .</p>

The flower at first is like the peaches , but at last turns white , and puts forth its fruit at the end of certain strings : as soon as the sun is set , the leaves close up the fruit , to preserve it from the dew , and open as soon as that luminary appears again . The fruit at first is green , but ripening it becomes of a dark grey , drawing towards a red , inclosed in husks , brown or twany , of taste a little bitter , like our prunelloes . The tree is as big as a walnut-tree , full of leaves , bearing its fruit at the branches , like the sheath of a knife , but not so straight , rather bent like a bow .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 53 ]</span>I have often , says Niebuhr , heard the Sheiks sing passages from the Koran , they never strain the voice by attempting to raise it too high , and this natural music pleased me very much .</p>
   <p>The airs of the Orientals are all grave and simple . They chuse their singers to sing so distinctly that every word may be comprehended . When several instruments are played at once and accompanied by the voice , you hear them all render the same melody , unless some one mingles a running base , either singing or playing , always in the same key . If this music is not greatly to our taste , ours is as little to the taste of the Orientals .</p>
   <p>Niebuhr . Description .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 54 ]</span>The Mosques , which they pronounce Mesg jid , are built exactly in the fashion of our Churches , where instead of such Seats and Benches as we make use of , they only strew the Floor with Mats , upon which they perform the several sittings and prostrations that are enjoyned in their religion . Near the middle , particularly of the principal Mosque of each city , there is a large pulpit erected , which is ballustraded round , with about half a dozen steps leading up to it . Upon these ( for I am told none are permitted to enter the pulpit ) the Mufty or one of the Im-ams placeth himself every Friday , the day of the congregation , as they call it , and from thence either explaineth some part or other of the Coran , or else exhorteth the people to piety and good works . That end of these Mosques , which regards Mecca , whither they direct themselves throughout the whole course of their devotions , is called the Kiblah , in which there is commonly a nich , representing as a judicious writer conjectures , the presence , and at the same time the invisibility of the Deity . There is usually a square tower erected at the other end , with a flag-staff upon the top of it . Hither the cryer ascends at the appointed times , and displaying a small flag , advertised the people with a loud voice , from each side of the battlements , of the hour of prayer . These places of the Mahometan worship , together with the Mufty , Im-ams and other persons belonging to them , are maintained out of certain revenues arising from the rents of lands and houses , either left by will or set apart by the public for that use .</p>
   <p>Shaw .</p>
   <p>All the Mosques are built nearly in the same style . They are of an oblong square form , and covered in the middle with a large dome , on the top of which is fixed a gilt crescent . In front there is a handsome portico covered with several small cupolas , and raised one step above the pavement of the court . The Turks sometimes in the hot season , perform their devotions there ; and between the columns , upon cross iron bars , are suspended a number of lamps , for illuminations on the Thursday nights and on all festivals . The entrance into the Mosque is by one large door . All these edifices are solidly built of freestone , and in several the domes are covered with lead . The minarets stand on one side adjoining to the body of the Mosque . They are sometimes square , but more commonly round and taper , the gallery for the maazeen , or cryers , projecting a little from the column near the top , has some resemblance to a rude capital ; and from this the spire tapering more in proportion than before , soon terminates in a point crowned with a crescent .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 55 ]</span>The Keabe is the point of direction and the centre of union for the prayers of the whole human race , as the Beith-mamour [ d ] is for those of all the celestial beings ; the Kursy [ e ] for those of the four Arch angels , and the Arsch [ f ] for those of the cherubims and seraphims who guard the throne of the Almighty . The inhabitants of Mecca , who enjoy the happiness of contemplating the Keabe , are obliged when they pray to fix their eyes upon the sanctuary ; but they who are at a distance from this valuable privilege are required only during prayer to direct their attention towards that hallowed edifice . The believer who is ignorant of the position of the Keabe must use every endeavour to gain a knowledge of it ; and after he has shown great solicitude , whatever be his success , his prayer is valid .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 56 ]</span>The Bedoweens live in tents , called Hhymas , from the shade they afford the inhabitants , and Beet el Shar , Houses of hair , from the matter they are made of . They are the same with what the Antients called Mapalia , which being then , as they are to this day , secured from the heat and inclemency of the weather , by a covering only of such hair cloth , as our coal sacks are made of , might very justly be described by Virgil to have thin roofs . When we find any number of them together ( and I have seen from 3 to 300 ) then they are usually placed in a circle , and constitute a Dou-war . The fashion of each tent is the same , being of an oblong figure , not unlike the bottom of a ship turned upside down , as Satlust hath long ago described them . However they differ in bigness , according to the number of people who live in them : and are accordingly supported , some with one pillar , others with two or three : whilst a curtain or carpet placed , upon occasion , at each of these divisions , separateth the whole into so many apartments . The pillar which I have mentioned , is a straight pole , 8 or 10 feet high and 3 or 4 inches in thickness , serving , not only to support the tent , but being full of hooks fixd there for the purpose , the Arabs hang upon it their cloaths , baskets , saddles , and accoutrements of war . Holofernes , as we read in Judith , 13 . 16. made the like use of the pillar of his tent , by hanging his fauchin upon it , it is there called the pillar of the bed , from the custom perhaps , that hath always prevailed , of having the upper end of the carpet , matrass , or whatever else they lie upon , turned from the skirts of the tent that way . But the [ Greek : Konopeion ] , Canopy as we render it ( ver . 9 ) should I presume , be rather called the gnat or muskeeta net , which is a close curtain of gauze or fine linnen , used all over the Levant , by people of better fashion , to keep out the flies . The Arabs have nothing of this kind ; who in taking their rest , lie horizontally upon the ground , without bed , matrass or pillow , wrapping themselves up only in their Hykes , and lying , as they find room upon a mat or carpet , in the middle or corner of the tent . Those who are married , have each of them a corner of the tent , cantoned off with a curtain .</p>
   <p>Shaw .</p>
   <p>The tents of the Moors are somewhat of a conic form , are seldom more than 8 or 10 feet high in the centre , and from 20 to 25 in length . Like those of the remotest antiquity , their figure is that of a ship overset , the keel of which is only seen . These tents are made of twine , composed of goat 's hair , camel 's wool , and the leaves of the wild palm , so that they keep out water ; but , being black , they produce a disagreable effect at a distant view .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 57 ]</span>In the kingdom of Imam the men of all ranks shave their heads . In some other countries of Yemen all the Arabs , even the Sheiks themselves , let their hair grow and wear neither bonnet nor Sasch , but a handkerchief instead , in which they tie the hair behind . Some let it fall upon their shoulders and bind a small cord round their heads instead of a turban . The Bedouins upon the frontiers of Hedsjas and of Yemen wear a bonnet of palm leaves , neatly platted .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 58 ]</span>The music of the Bedoweens rarely consists of more than one strain , suitable to their homely instruments , and to their simple invention . The Arabebbah as they call the bladder and string , is in the highest vogue , and doubtless of great antiquity , as is also the Gaspah , which is only a common reed , open at each end , having the side of it bored , with three or more holes , according to the ability of the Person who is to touch it : tho ’ the compass of their tunes rarely or ever exceeds an octave . Yet sometimes , even in this simplicity of harmony , they observe something of method and ceremony , for in their historical Cantatas especially , they have their preludes and symphonies ; each stanza being introduced with a flourish from the Arabebbah , while the narration itself is accompanied with the softest touches they are able to make , upon the Gaspah . The Tarr , another of their instruments , is made like a Sive , consisting ( as Isidore describeth the Tympanum ) of a thin rim or hoop of wood , with a skin of parchment stretched over the top of it . This serves for the Bass in all their Concerts , which they accordingly touch very artfully with their fingers , and the knuckles or palms of their hands , as the time and measure require , or as force and softness are to be communicated to the several parts of the performance . The Tarr is undoubtedly the Tympanum of the Antients , which appears as well from the general use of it all over Barbary , Egypt and the Levant , as from the method of playing upon it , and the figure of the instrument itself , being exactly of the same fashion , with what we find in the hands of Cybele and the Bacchanals among the Basso Relievos and Statues of the Antiets .</p>

   <p>How great soever may have been the reputation the Libyans once had , of being famous musicians , and of having invented the pipe or flute , called by Greek author Hippophorbos , I fancy few of them would be now much liked at our Opera . As for this tibicen , flute or pipe , it is certainly lost , except it be the gayta , somewhat like the hautbois , called zurna , in Turkish , a martial instrument . Julius Pollux , in a chapter entitled de tibiarum specie , says , Hippophorbos quam quidem Libyes Scenetes invenerunt , and again , shewing the use and quality thereof , haec vero apud equorum pascua utuntur , ejusque materia decorticata laurus est , cor enim ligni extractum acutissimam dat sonum . The sound of the gayta agrees well with this description , tho ’ not the make . Several Poets mention the tibicen Libycus and Arabicus : and Alhenaeus quotes Duris , and says , Libycas tibia Poetae appellant , ut inquit Duris , libro secundo de rebus gestis Agathoclis , quod Scirites , primus , ut credunt , tibicinum artis inventor , e gente Nomadum Libycorum fuerit , primusque tibiae Cerealium hymnorum cantor .</p>

   <p>It seems the Arabs are still great rhymers , and their verses are sometimes rewarded , but I should not venture to say that there are great Poets among them . Yet I was assured in Yemen that it is not uncommon to find them among the wandering Arabs in the country of Dsjaf . It is some few years since a Sheik of these Arabs was in prison at Sana : seeing by chance a bird upon a roof opposite to him , he recollected that the devout Mohammedans believe they perform an action agreable to God in giving liberty to a bird encaged . He thought therefore he had as much right to liberty as a bird , and made a poem upon the subject , which was first learnt by his guards , and then became so popular that at last it reached the Imam . He was so pleased with it that he liberated the Sheik , whom he had arrested for his robberies .</p>

Their airs , in point of character and execution , resemble nothing we have heard in Europe , except the Seguidillas of the Spaniards . They have divisions more laboured even than those of the Italians , and cadences and inflections of tone impossible to be imitated by European throats . Their performance is accompanied with sighs and gestures , which paint the passions in a more lively manner than we snould venture to allow . They may be said to excell most in the melancholy strain . To behold an Arab with his head inclined , his hand applied to his ear , his eye brows knit , his eyes languishing ; to hear his plaintive tones , his lengthened notes , his sighs and sobs , it is almost impossible to refrain from tears , which as their expression is , are far from bitter : and indeed they must certainly find a pleasure in shedding them , since among all their songs , they constantly prefer that which excites them most , as among all accomplishments singing is that they most admire .</p>

   <p>All their literature consists in reciting tales and histories , in the manner of the Arabian Nights Entertainments . They have a peculiar passion for such stories : and employ in them almost all their leisure , of which they have a great deal . In the evening they seat themselves on the ground at the door of their tents , or under cover if it be cold , and there , ranged in a circle , round a little fire of dung , their pipes in their mouths , and their legs crossed , they sit awhile in silent meditation , till , on a sudden , one of them breaks forth with , Once upon a time ,— and continues to recite the adventures of some young Shaik and female Bedouin : he relates in what manner the youth first got a secret glimpse of his mistress , and how he became desperately enamoured of her : he minutely describes the lovely fair , extols her black eyes , as large and soft as those of the gazelle ; her languid and empassioned looks ; her arched eye brows , resembling two bows of ebony ; her waist , straight and supple as a lance ; he forgets not her steps , light as those of the young filley , nor her eye-lashes blackened with kohl , nor her lips painted blue , nor her nails , tinged with the golden coloured henna , nor her breasts , resembling two pomegranates , nor her words , sweet as honey . He recounts the sufferings of the young lover , so wasted with desire and passion , that his body no longer yields any shadow . At length , after detailing his various attempts to see his mistress , the obstacles on the part of the parents , the invasions of the enemy , the captivity of the two lovers , &amp; c. he terminates , to the satisfaction of the audience , by restoring them , united and happy , to the paternal tent , and by receiving the tribute paid to his eloquence , in the ma sha allah [ g ] he has merited .

   <p>Chenier .</p>
   <p>In 1778 the empire of Morocco was ravaged by these insects . In the summer of that year , such clouds of locusts came from the south that they darkened the air , and devoured a part of the harvest . Their offspring , which they left on the ground , committed still much greater mischief . Locusts appeared and bred anew in the following year , so that in the spring the country was wholly covered , and they crawled one over the other in search of their subsistence .</p>
   <p>It has been remarked , in speaking of the climate of Morocco , that the young locusts are those which are the most mischievous ; and that it seems almost impossible to rid the land of these insects and their ravages , when the country once becomes thus afflicted . In order to preserve the houses and gardens in the neighbourhood of cities , they dig a ditch two feet in depth and as much in width . This they pallisade with reeds close to each other , and inclined inward toward the ditch ; so that the insects unable to climb up the slippery reed , fall back into the ditch , where they devour one another .</p>
   <p>This was the means by which the gardens and vineyards of Rabat , and the city itself were delivered from this scourge , in 1779 . The intrenchment , which was , at least , a league in extent , formed a semicircle from the sea to river , which separates Rabat from Sallee . The quantity of young locusts here assembled was so prodigious that , on the third day , the ditch could not be approached because of the stench . The whole country was eaten up , the very bark of the fig , pomegranate , and orange tree , bitter , hard , and corrosive as it was could not escape the voracity of these insects .</p>
   <p>The lands , ravaged throughout all the western provinces , produced no harvest , and the Moors being obliged to live on their stores , which the exportation of corn ( permitted till 1774 ) had drained , began to feel a dearth . Their cattle , for which they make no provision , and which in these climates , have no other subsistance than that of daily grazing , died with hunger ; nor could any be preserved but those which were in the neighbourhood of mountains , or in marshy grounds , where the regrowth of pasturage is more rapid .</p>
   <p>In 1780 , the distress was still farther increased . The dry winter had checked the products of the earth , and given birth to a new generation of locusts , who devoured whatever had escaped from the inclemency of the season . The husbandman did not reap even what he had sowed , and found himself destitute of food , cattle , or seed corn . In this time of extreme wretchedness the poor felt all the horrors of famine . They were seen wandering over the country to devour roots , and , perhaps , abridged their days by digging into the entrails of the earth in search of the crude means by which they might be preserved .</p>
   <p>Vast numbers perished of indigestible food and want . I have beheld country people in the roads , and in the streets , who had died of hunger , and who were thrown across asses to be taken and buried . Fathers sold their children . The husband , with the consent of his wife , would take her into another province , there to bestow her in marriage as if she were his sister , and afterwards come and reclaim her when his wants were no longer so great . I have seen women and children run after camels , and rake in their dung to seek for some indigested grain of barley , which , if they found , they devoured with avidity .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>The Abmelec or eater of Locusts , or grasshoppers , is a bird which better deserves to be described , perhaps , than most others of which travellers have given us an account , because the facts relating to it are not only strange , in themselves , but so well and distinctly attested , that however surprising they may seem , we cannot but afford them our belief . The food of this creature is the locust , or the grasshopper : it is of the size of an ordinary hen , its feathers black , its wings large , and its flesh of a greyish colour ; they fly generally in great flocks , as the starlings are wont to do with us : but the thing which renders these birds wonderful is , that they are so fond of the water of a certain fountain in Corasson , or Bactria , that where-ever that water is carried , they follow ; on which account it is carefully preserved ; for where ever the locusts fall , the Armenian priests , who are provided with this water , bring a quanity of it , and place in jars , or pour it into little channels in the fields , the next day whole troops of these birds arrive and quickly deliver the people from the locusts .</p>
   <p>Universal History .</p>
   <p>Sir John Chardin has given us , the following passage from an antient traveller , in relation to this bird . In Cyprus about the time that the corn was ripe for the sickle , the earth produced such a quantity of cavalettes , or locusts , that they obscured sometimes the splendour of the sun . Wherever these came , they burnt and eat up all ; for this there was no remedy , since , as fast as they were destroyed , the earth produced more : God , however , raised them up a means for their deliverance , which happened thus . In Persia , near the city of Cuerch there is a fountain of water , which has a wonderful property of destroying these insects ; for a pitcher full of this being carried in the open air , without passing through house or vault , and being set on an high place , certain birds which follow it , and fly and cry after the men who carry it from the fountain , come to the place where it is fixed . These birds are red and black , and fly in great flocks together , like starlings ; the Turks and Persians call them Musulmans . These birds no sooner came to Cyprus , but they destroyed the locusts with which the Island was infested ; but if the water be spilt or lost these creatures immediately disappear ; which accident fell out when the Turks took this Island ; for one of them going up into the steeple of Famagusta , and finding there a pitcher of this water , he , fancying that it contained gold or silver , or some precious thing , broke it , and spilt what was therein ; since which the Cypriots have been as much tormented as ever by the locusts .</p>
   <p>On the confines of the Medes and of Armenia , at certain times a great quantity of Birds are seen who resemble our blackbirds , and they have a property sufficiently curious to make me mention it . When the corn in these parts begins to grow , it is astonishing to see the number of Locusts with which all the fields are covered . The Armenians have no other method of delivering themselves from these insects , than by going in procession round the fields and sprinkling them with a particular water which they take care to preserve in their houses . For this water comes from a great distance , they fetch it from a Well belonging to one of their Convents near the frontiers , and they say that the bodies of many Christian martyrs were formerly thrown into this well . These processions and the sprinkling continue three or four days , after which the Birds that I have mentioned come in great flights , and whether it be that they eat the locusts , or drive them away , in two or three days the country is cleared of them .</p>
   <p>Tavernier .</p>
   <p>At Mosul and at Haleb , says Niebuhr , I heard much of the Locust Bird , without seeing it . They there call it Samarmar , or as others pronounce it , Samarmog . It is said to be black , larger than a sparrow , and no ways pleasant to the palate . I am assured that it every day destroys an incredible number of Locusts ; they pretend nevertheless that the Locusts sometimes defend themselves , and devour the Bird with its feathers , when they have overpowered it by numbers . When the children in the frontier towns of Arabia catch a live Locust , they place it before them and cry Samarmog ! And because it stoops down terrified at the noise , or at the motion of the child , or clings more closely to its place , the children believe that it fears the name of its enemy , that it hides itself , and attempts to throw stones . The Samarmog is not a native of Mosul or Haleb , but they go to seek it in Khorasan with much ceremony . When the Locusts multiply very greatly , the government sends persons worthy of trust to a spring near the village of Samarun , situated in a plain between four mountains , by Mesched , or Musa er ridda , in that province of Persia . The deputies with the ceremonies prescribed fill a chest with this water , and pitch the chest so that the water may neither evaporate nor be spilt before their return . From the spring to the Town whence they were sent , the chest must always be between heaven and earth : they must neither place it on the ground , nor under any roof , lest it should lose all its virtue . Mosul being surrounded with a wall , the water must not pass under the gate way , but it is received over the wall , and the chest placed upon the Mosque Nebbi Gurgis , a building which was formerly a church , and which in preference to all the other buildings has had from time immemorial the honour to possess this chest upon its roof . When this precious water has been brought from Khorasan with the requisite precautions , the common Mohammedans , Christians and Jews of Mosul believe that the Samarmog follows the water , and remains in the country as long as there is a single drop left in the chest of Nebbi-Gurgis . Seeing one day a large stork 's nest upon this vessel , I told a Christian of some eminence in the town , how much I admired the quick smell of the Samarmog , who perceived the smell of the water thro ’ such a quantity of ordure , he did not answer me , but was very much scandalized that the government should have permitted the stork to make her nest upon so rare a treasure , and still more angry , that for more than nine years , the government had not sent to procure fresh water .</p>

   <p>Dr. Russell describes this bird as about the size of a starling , the body of a flesh colour , the rest of its plumage black , the bill and legs black also .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>The Locusts are remarkable for the hieroglyphic that they bear upon the forehead , their colour is green throughout the whole body , excepting a little yellow rim that surrounds their head , which is lost at their eyes . This insect has two upper wings pretty solid : they are green like the rest of the body , except that there is in each a little white spot . The Locust keeps them extended like great sails of a ship going before the wind , it has besides two other wings underneath the former , and which resemble a light transparent stuff pretty much like a cobweb , and which it makes use of in the manner of smack sails that are along a vessel ; but when the Locust reposes herself she does like a vessel that lies at anchor , for she keeps the second sails furled under the first .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span>The Ism-Ablah — The Science of the Name of God . They pretend that God is the lock of this science , and Mohammed the key , that consequently none but Mohammedans can attain it ; that it discovers what passes in distant countries , that it familiarizes the possessors with the Genii , who are at the command of the initiated and who instruct them ; that it places the winds and the seasons at their disposal , that it heals the bile of serpents , the lame , the maimed , and the blind . They say that some of their greatest Saints , such as Abdulkadir Cheilani of Bagdat , and Ibn Alwan who resided in the south of Yemen , were so far advanced in this science by their devotion , that they said their prayers every noon in the Kaba of Mecca , and were not absent from their own houses any other part of the day . A merchant of Mecca , who had learnt it in all its forms from Mohammed el Dsjanadsjeni ( at present so famous in that city ) pretended that he himself being in danger of perishing at sea , had fastened a billet to the mast with the usual ceremonies , and that immediately the tempest ceased . He showed me at Bombay , but at a distance , a book which contained all sorts of figures and mathematical tables , with instructions how to arrange the billets and the appropriate prayers for every circumstance . But he would neither suffer me to touch the Book , nor copy the title .</p>
   <p>There are some Mohammedans who shut themselves up in a dark place without eating and drinking for a long time , and there with a loud voice repeat certain short prayers till they faint . When they recover they pretend to have seen not only a croud of Spirits , but God himself , and even the Devil . But the true initiated in the Ism-Allah do not seek these visions . The secret of discovering hidden treasures , belong also , if I mistake not , to the Ism Allah .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 74 ]</span>One of these Hykes is usually six yards long and 5 or 6 foot broad , serving the Arab for a compleat dress in the day , and for his bed and covering in the night . It is a loose but troublesome kind of garment , being frequently disconcerted and falling upon the ground , so that the person who wears it , is every moment obliged to tuck it up , and fold it anew about his body . This shews the great use there is for a girdle in attending any active employment , and in consequence thereof , the force of the scripture injunction alluding thereunto , of having our loyns girded . The method of wearing these garments , with the use they are at other times put to , in serving for coverlets to their beds , should induce us to take the finer sort of them at least , such as are wore by the Ladies and persons of distinction , to be the peplus of the antients . It is very probable likewise , that the loose folding garment , ( the Toga I take it to be ) of the Romans , was of this kind : for if the drapery of their statues is to instruct us , this is actually no other than what the Arabs appear in , when they are folded up in their Hykes . Instead of the fibula , they join together , with thread or a wooden bodkin , the two upper corners of this garment , which being first placed over one of their shoulders , they fold the rest of it afterwards round their bodies .</p>

   <p>The employment of the women is to prepare their wool , spin , and weave in looms hung lengthways in their tents . These looms are formed by a list of an ell and a half long , to which the threads of the warp are fixed at one end , and at the other on a roller of equal length ; the weight of which , being suspended , keeps them stretched . The threads of the warp are so hung as to be readily intersected . Instead of shuttles , the women pass the thread of the woof thro ’ the warp with their fingers , and with an iron comb , having a handle , press the woof to give a body to their cloth . Each piece of about 5 ells long , and an ell and a half wide , is called a haick ; it receives neither dressing , milling nor dying , but is immediately fit for use : it is the constant dress of the Moors of the country , is without seam , and incapable of varying according to the caprices of fashion . When dirty it is washed : the Moor is wrapped up in it day and night , and this haick is the living model of the drapery of the ancients .</p>

   <p>Anchieta was going in a canoe to the mouth of the river Aldea , a delightful spot , surrounded with mango trees , and usually abounding with birds called goarazes , that breed there . These birds are about the size of a hen , their colour a rich purple , inclining to red . They are white when hatched , and soon become black , but as they grow larger lose that colour and take this rich and beautiful purple . Our navigators had reached the place , but when they should have enjoyed the fine prospect which delights all who pass it , the sun was excessively hot , and this eye-pleasure was purchased dearly when the whole body was in a profuse perspiration , and the rowers were in a fever . Their distress called upon Joseph , and the remedy was no new one to him . He saw three or four of these birds perched upon a mango , and calling to them in the Brazilian language which the rowers understood , said , go you , call your companions , and come to shade these hot servants of the Lord . The birds stretched out their necks as if in obedience , and away they went to seek for others , and in a short time they came flying in the shape of an elegant cloud , and they shadowed the canoe a good league out to sea till the fresh sea breeze sprung up . Then they told them they might go about their business , and they separated with a clamor of rude but joyful sounds , which were only understood by the Author of Nature who created them . This was a greater miracle than that of the cloud with which God defended his chosen people in the wilderness from the heat of the sun , inasmuch as it was a more elegant and fanciful parasol .

Then , and then only , will he resign his burden and body to the ground . Nor stripes , nor caresses nor food , nor rest , will make him rise again ! His vigor is exhausted , and life ebbs out apace ! This the Arabs are very sensible of , and kindly plunge a sword into the breast of the dying beast , to shorten his pangs .

   <p>No creature seems so peculiarly fitted to the climate in which it exists . We cannot doubt the nature of the one has been adapted to that of the other by some disposing intelligence . Designing the Camel to dwell in a country where he can find little nourishment , Nature has been sparing of her materials in the whole of his formation , She has not bestowed upon him the plump fleshiness of the ox , horse , or elephant ; but limiting herself to what is strictly necessary , she has given him a small head without ears , at the end of a long neck without flesh . She has taken from his legs and thighs every muscle not immediately resquisite for motion ; and in short has bestowed on his withered body only the vessels and tendons necessary to connect his frame together . She has furnished him with a strong jaw , that he may grind the hardest aliments ; but lest he should consume too much , she has contracted his stomach , and obliged him to chew the cud . She has lined his foot with a lump of flesh , which , sliding in the mud , and being no way adapted for climbing , fits him only for a dry , level , and sandy soil , like that of Arabia . She has evidently destined him likewise to slavery , by refusing him every sort of defence against his enemies . Destitute of the horns of the bull , the hoofs of the horse , the tooth of the elephant , and the swiftness of the stag , how can the camel resist or avoid the attacks of the lion , the tyger , or even the wolf ? To preserve the species therefore , Nature has concealed him in the depths of the vast deserts , where the want of vegetables can attract no game , and whence the want of game repels every voracious animal . Tyranny must have expelled man from the habitable parts of the earth , before the Camel could have lost his liberty . Become domestic , he has rendered habitable the most barren soil the world contains . He alone supplies all his master 's wants . The milk of the Camel nourishes the family of the Arab , under the various forms of curds , cheese , and butter ; and they often feed upon his flesh . Slippers and harness are made of his skin , and tents and clothing of his hair . Heavy burthens are transported by his means , and when the earth denies forage to the horse , so valuable to the Bedouin , the she-camel supplies that deficiency by her milk , at no other cost , for so many advantages , than a few stalks of brambles or wormwood , and pounded date kernels . So great is the importance of the Camel to the desert , that were it deprived of that useful animal , it must infallibly lose every inhabitant .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 82 ]</span>Where any part of these Deserts is sandy and level , the Horizon is as fit for astronomical observations as the sea , and appears at a small distance , to be no less a collection of water . It was likewise equally surprising to observe , in what an extraordinary manner every object appeared to be magified within it ; insomuch that a shrub seemed as big as a tree , and a flock of Achbobbas might be mistaken for a caravan of Camels . This seeming collection of water , always advances , about a quarter of a mile before us , whilst the intermediate space appears to be in one continued glow , occasioned by the quivering undulating motion of that quick succession of vapours and exhalations , which are extracted by the powerful influence of the sun .</p>

   <p>In the Bahar Danush is a metaphor drawn from this optical deception . “ It is the ancient custom of Fortune , and time has long established the habit , that she at first bewilders the thirsty travellers in the path of desire , by the misty vapour of disappointment ; but when their distress and misery has reached extremity , suddenly relieving them from the dark windings of confusion and error , she conducts them to the fountains of enjoyment . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 83 ]</span>Perhaps no traveller but Mr. Park ever survived to relate similar sufferings .</p>
   <p>“ I pushed on as fast as possible , in hopes of reaching some watering-place in the course of the night . My thirst was by this time become insufferable ; my mouth was parched and inflamed ; a sudden dimness would frequently come over my eyes , with other symptoms of fainting ; and my horse being very much fatigued , I began seriously to apprehend that I should perish of thirst . To relieve the burning pain in my mouth and throat , I chewed the leaves of different shrubs , but found them all bitter and of no service to me .</p>
   <p>A little before sunset , having reached the top of a gentle rising , I climbed a high tree , from the topmost branches of which I cast a melancholy look over the barren wilderness , but without discovering the most distant trace of a human dwelling . The same dismal uniformity of shrubs and sand every where presents itself , and the horizon , was as level and uninterrupted as that of the sea .</p>
   <p>Descending from the tree , I found my horse devouring the stubble and brushwood with great avidity ; and as I was now too faint to attempt walking , and my horse too much fatigued to carry me , I thought it but an act of humanity , and perhaps the last I should ever have it in my power to perform , to take off his bridle and let him shift for himself : in doing which I was suddenly affected with sickness and giddiness , and falling upon the sand , felt as if the hour of death was fast approaching . Here then , thought I , after a short but ineffectual struggle , terminate all my hopes of being useful in my day and generation ; here must the short span of my life come to an end .— I cast ( as I believed ) a last look on the surrounding scene , and whilst I reflected on the awful change that was about to take place , this world with its enjoyments seemed to vanish from my recollection . Nature however , at length resumed its functions ; and on recovering my senses , I found myself stretched upon the sand with the bridle still in my hand , and the sun just sinking behind the trees . I now summoned all my resolution , and determined to make another effort to prolong my existence . And as the evening was somewhat cool , I resolved to travel as far as my limbs would carry me , in hopes of reaching ( my only resource ) a watering place . With this view I put the bridle on my horse , and driving him before me , went slowly along for about an hour , when I perceived some lightning from the north east , a most delightful sight , for it promised rain . The darkness and lightning increased very rapidly ; and in less than an hour I heard the wind roaring among the bushes . I had already opened my mouth to receive the refreshing drops which I expected , but I was instantly covered with a cloud of sand , driven with such force by the wind as to give a very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms , and I was obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush , to prevent being suffocated . The sand continued to fly in amazing quantities for near an hour , after which I again set forward , and travelled with difficulty , until ten o'clock . About this time I was agreeably surprized by some very vivid flashes of lightning , followed by a few heavy drops of rain . In a little time the sand ceased to fly , and I alighted , and spread out all my clean clothes to collect the rain , which at length I saw would certainly fall .— For more than an hour it rained plentifully , and I quenched my thirst , by wringing and sucking my clothes .</p>
   <p>Park 's Travels in the Interior of Africa .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 84 ]</span>All the time I was in Barbary I could never get sight of above three or four Dromedaries . These the Arabs call Mehera , the singular is Meheri . They are of several sorts , and degrees of value , some worth many common Camels , others scarce worth two or three . To look on , they seem little different from the rest of that Species , only I think the Excrescence on a Dromedary 's Back is somewhat less than that of a Camel . What is reported of their sleeping , or rather seeming scarce alive , for some Time after coming into this World , is no Fable . The longer they lie so , the more excellent they prove in their Kind , and consequently of higher Price and Esteem . None lie in that Trance more than ten Days and Nights . These that do , are pretty rare , and are called Ashari from Aashara , which signifies ten in Arabick . I saw one such , perfectly white all over , belonging to Lella Oumane Princess of that noble Arab Neja , named Hayl ben Ali , I spoke of , and upon which she put a very great Value , never sending it abroad but upon some extraordinary Occasion , when the greatest Expedition was required ; having others , inferior in swiftness , for more ordinary Messages . They say that one of these Aasharies will , in one Night , and thro ’ a level Country , traverse as much Ground as any single Horse can perform in ten , which is no Exaggeration of the Matter , since many have affirmed to me , that it makes nothing of holding its rapid Pace , which is a most violent Hard Trot , for four and twenty Hours upon a Stretch without shewing the least Sign of Weariness , or Inclination to Bait ; and that having then swallowed a Ball or two of Sort of a Paste , made up of Barley-Meal , and may be a little Powder of Dates among it , with a Bowl of Water , or Camel 's Milk , if to be had , and which the Courier seldom forgets to be provided with , in Skins , as well for the Sustenance of himself as of his Pegasus , the indefatigable Animal will seem as fresh as at first setting out , and ready to continue running at the same scarce credible Rate , for as many Hours longer , and so on from one Extremity of the African Desarts to the other ; provided its Rider could hold out without Sleep , and other Refreshment . This has been averred to me , by , I believe more than a thousand Arabs and Moors , all agreeing in every Particular .</p>
   <p>I happened to be , once in particular , at the Tent of that Princess , with Ali ben Mahamoud , the Bey , or Vice-Roy of the Algerine Eastern Province , when he went thither to celebrate his Nuptials with Ambarca , her only Daughter , if I mistake not . Among other Entertainments she gave her Guests , the favourite white Dromedary was brought forth , ready Saddled and Bridled . I say Bridled , because the Thong , which serves instead of a Bridle , was put thro ’ the Hole purposely made in the Gristle of the Creature 's Nose . The Arab appointed to mount , was straightly laced , from the very Loins quite to his Throat , in a strong Leathern Jacket ; they never riding these Animals any otherwise accoutred , so impetuously violent are the Concussions the Rider undergoes , during that rapid Motion , that were he to be loose . I much question whether a few Hours such unintermitting Agitation would not endanger the bursting of some of his Entrails : And this the Arabs scruple not to acknowledge . We were to be diverted with seeing this fine Ashari run against some of the swiftest Barbs in the whole Neja , which is famed for having good ones , of the true Libyan Breed , shaped like Greyhounds , and which will sometimes run down an Ostridge ; which few of the very best can pretend to do , especially upon a hard Ground , perfectly level . We all started like Racers , and for the first Spurt , most of the best mounted among us kept up pretty well , but our Grass fed Horses soon flagged : Several of the Libyan and Numidian Runners held Pace till we , who still followed upon a good round Hand Gallop , could no longer discern them , and then gave out ; as we were told after their Return . When the Dromedary had been out of our Sight about half an Hour , we again espied it flying towards us with an amazing Volocity , and in a very few Moments was among us , and seemingly nothing concerned ; while the Horses and Mares were all on a Foam , and scarce able to breathe , as was , likewise , a fleet , tall Greyhound Bitch , of the young Prince 's , who had followed and kept Pace the whole Time , and was no sooner got back to us , but lay down panting as if ready to expire . I cannot tell how many Miles we went ; but we were near three Hours in coming leisurely back to the Tents , yet made no Stop in the Way . The young Prince Hamet ben al Guydom ben Sakhari , and his younger Brother Messoud , told their new Brother-in-Law , that they defied all the Potentates of Africa to shew him such an Ashari ; and the Arab who rode it , challenged the Bey to lay his Lady a Wager of 1000 Ducats , that he did not bring him an Answer to a Letter from the Prince of Wargala , in less than four Days , tho ’ Leo Africanus , Marmol , and several others assure us , that it is no less than forty Spanish Leagues , of four Miles each , South of Tuggurt to which Place , upon another Occasion , as I shall observe , we made six tedious Days March from the Neighbourhood of Biscara , North of which we were then , at least thirty Hours riding , if I remember rightly . However the Bey , who was a Native of Biscara , and consequently well acquainted with the Sahara , durst not take him up . By all Circumstances , and the Description given us , besides what I know of the Matter my self , it could not be much less than 400 Miles , and as many back again , the fellow offered to ride , in so short a Time ; nay many other Arabs boldly proffered to venture all they were worth in the World , that he would perform it with all the Ease imaginable .</p>

   <p>Chenier says “ the Dromedary can travel 60 leagues in a day , his motion is so rapid that the rider is obliged to be girthed to the saddle , and to have a handkerchief before his mouth to break the current of the wind . ” — These accounts are probably much exaggerated .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 85 ]</span>We were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely the most magnificent in the world . In that vast expanse of desert , from W. and to N. W. of us , we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances , at times moving with great celerity , at others stalking with a majestic slowness : at intervals we thought they were coming in a very few moments to overwhelm us , and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us . Again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight , their tops reaching to the very clouds . There the tops often separated from the bodies , and these once disjoined , dispersed in the air and did not appear more . Sometimes they were broken near the middle , as if struck with a large cannon shot . About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us , the wind being very strong at north . Eleven of them ranged alongside of us about the distance of three miles . The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure ten feet . They retired from us with a wind at S. E. leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name ; though surely one ingredient in it was fear , with a considerable deal of wonder and astonishment . It was in vain to think of flying , the swiftest horse , or fastest sailing ship could be of no use to carry us out of this danger , and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as if to the spot where I stood .</p>
   <p>On the 15th the same appearance of moving pillars of sand presented themselves to us , only they seemed to be more in number , and less in size . They came several times in a direction close upon us ; that is , I believe , within less than two miles . They began immediately after sun-rise , like a thick wood , and almost darkened the sun . His rays shining through them for near an hour , gave them an appearance of pillars of fire . Our people now became desperate : the Greeks shrieked out , and said it was the day of judgement . Ismael pronounced it to be hell , and the Tucorories that the world was on fire .</p>

   <p>The circuit of Ispahan taking in the suburbs is not less than that of Paris , but Paris contains ten times the number of its inhabitants .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span>Almanzor riding one day with his courtiers along the banks of the Tigris , where Seleucia formerly stood , was so delighted with the beauty of the country , that he resolved there to build his new Capital . Whilst he was conversing with his attendants upon this project , one of them separating from the rest met a hermit whose cell was near , and entered into talk with him and communicated the design of the Caliph . The Hermit replied , he well knew by a tradition of the country that a city would one day be built in that plain , but that its founder would be a man called Moclas , a name very different from both those of the Caliph , Giaffar and Almanzor .</p>
   <p>The Officer rejoined Almanzor and repeated his conversation with the Hermit . As soon as the Caliph heard the name of Moclas , he descended from his horse , prostrated himself , and returned thanks to God for that he was chosen to execute his orders . His courtiers waited for an explanation of this conduct with eagerness , and the Caliph told them thus . During the Caliphate of the Ommiades , my brothers and myself being very young and possessing very little , were obliged to live in the country , where each in rotation was to provide sustenance for the whole . On one of my days as I was without money , and had no means of procuring food , I took a bracelet belonging to my nurse and pawned it . This woman made a great outcry , and after much search discovered that I had been the thief . In her anger she abused me plentifully , and among other terms of reproach , she called me Moclas , the name of a famous robber in those days ; and during the rest of her life she never called me by any other name . Therefore I know that God has destined me to perform this work .</p>
   <p>Marigny .</p>
   <p>Almanzor named his new city Dar-al-Salam the City of Peace ; but it obtained the name of Bagdat , from that of this Hermit who dwelt upon its site .</p>
   <p>Bagdat was founded in consequence of a singular superstition . A sect called Ravendiens conceived that they ought to render those honours to the Caliphs , which the Moslem hold should only be paid to the Deity . They therefore came in great numbers to Haschemia , where the Caliph Almanzor usually resided , and made around his palace the same processions and ceremonies which the Moslem made around the Temple at Mecca . The Caliph prohibited this , commanding them not to profane a religious ceremony which ought to be reserved solely to the Temple at Mecca . The Ravendiens did not regard the prohibition , and continued to act as before .</p>
   <p>Almanzor seeing their obstinacy resolved to conquer it , and began by arresting an hundred of these fanatics . This astonished them , but they soon recovered their courage , took arms , marched to the prison , forced the doors , delivered their friends , and then returned to make their processions round the palace in reverence of the Caliph .</p>
   <p>Enraged at this insolence the Caliph put himself at the head of his guards , and advanced against the Ravendiens , expecting that his appearance would immediately disperse them . Instead of this they resisted , and repulsed him so vigorously that he had nearly fallen a victim . But timely succours arrived and after a great slaughter these fanatics were expelled the town . This singular rebellion arising from excess of loyalty so disgusted Almanzor that he determined to forsake the town which had witnessed it , and accordingly laid the foundation of Bagdat .</p>

It is as loud as a watchman 's rattle , and not much unlike it in sound .</p>

This was continued the whole night . An Owl , a bird also unmolested , was perched hard by , and as frequently hooted . The crane is tall , like a heron , but much larger ; the body white , with black pinions , the neck and legs very long , the head small , and the bill thick . The Turks call it friend and brother , believing it has an affection for their nation , and will accompany them into the countries they shall conquer . In the course of our journey we saw one hopping on a wall with a single leg , the maimed stump wrapped in linen .</p>

   <p>The Tower of Nimrod or Babel is situate on that side of Tygris that Arabia is , and in a very great plaine distant from Babylon seven or eight miles ; which tower is ruinated on every side , and with the falling of it there is made a great mountaine ; so that it hath no forme at all , yet there is a great part of it standing , which is compassed and almost covered with the aforesayd fallings : this Tower was builded and made of foure-square brickes , which brickes were made of earth , and dried in the Sunne in maner and forme following : first they layed a lay of brickes , then a mat made of canes , square as the brickes , and instead of lime , they daubed it with earth : these mats of canes are at this time so strong , that it is a thing woonderfull to beholde , being of such great antiquity : I have gone round about it , and have not found any place where there hath bene any doore or entrance : it may be in my judgement in circuit about a mile , and rather lesse than more .</p>
   <p>This Tower in effect is contrary to all other things which are seene afar off , for they seeme small and the more nere a man commeth to them the bigger they be : but this tower afar off seemeth a very great thing , and the nerer you come to it the lesser . My judgement and reason of this is , that because the Tower is set in a very great plaine , and hath nothing more about to make any shew saving the ruines of it which it hath made round about , and for this respect descrying it afarre off , that piece of the Tower which yet standeth with the mountaine that is made of the substance that hath fallen from it , maketh a greater shew than you shall finde comming neere to it .</p>
   <p>Caesar Frederick .</p>
   <p>John Eldred mentions the same deception . “ Being upon a plaine grounde it seemeth afarre off very great , but the nerer you come to it , the lesser and lesser it appeareth .

   <p>Hakluyt .</p>
   <p>In the middle of a vast and level plain , about a quarter of a league from Euphrates , which in that place runs westward , appears a heap of ruined buildings , like a huge mountain , the materials of which are so confounded together that one knows not what to make of it . Its figure is square , and rises in form of a tower or pyramid with four fronts which answer to the four quarters of the compass ; but it seems longer from north to S. than from E. to W. and is , as far as I could judge by my pacing it , a large quarter of a league . Its situation and form correspond with that pyramid which Strabo calls the tower of Belus ; and is in all likelihood the tower of Nimrod in Babylon or Babel , as that place is still called . In that author 's time it had nothing remaining of the stairs and other ornaments mentioned by Herodotus , the greatest part of it having been ruined by Xerxes ; and Alexander who designed to have restored it to its former lustre , was prevented by death . There appear no marks of ruins without the compass of that huge mass , to convince one that so great a city as Babylon had ever stood there ; all one discovers within 50 or 60 paces of it , being only the remains here and there of some foundations of buildings ; and the country round about it so flat and level , that one can hardly believe it should be chosen for the situation of so great and noble a city as Babylon , or that there were ever any remarkable buildings on it . But for my part I am astonished there appears so much as there does , considering it is at least 4000 years since that city was built ; and that Diodorus Siculus tells us , it was reduced almost to nothing in his time . The height of this mountain of ruins is not in every part equal , but exceeds the highest palace in Naples : it is a mishapen mass , wherein there is no appearance of regularity ; in some places it rises in points , is craggy and inaccessible ; in others it is smoother and is of easier ascent ; there are also tracks of torrents from the top to the bottom caused by the rains , and both withinside and upon it , one sees parts , some higher and some lower . It is not to be discovered whether ever there were any steps to ascend it , or any doors to enter into it ; whence one may easily judge that the stairs ran winding about on the outside ; and that being the less solid parts , they were soonest demolished , so that not the least sign of any appears at present .</p>
   <p>Withinside one finds some grottos , but so ruined that one can make nothing of them , whether they were built at the same time with that work , or made since by the peasants for shelter , which last seems to be the most likely . The Mohammedans believe that these caverns were appointed by God as places of punishment for Harut and Marut , two angels , who they suppose were sent from heaven to judge the armies of men , but did not execute their commissions as they ought . It is evident from these ruins , that the tower of Nimrod was built with great and thick bricks , as I carefully observed , causing holes to be dug in several places for the purpose ; but they do not appear to have been burnt , but dried in the sun , which is extreme hot in those parts . In laying these bricks neither lime nor sand was employed , but only earth tempered and petrified , and in those parts which made the floors , there had been mingled with that earth which served instead of lime , bruised reeds , or hard straw , such as large mats are made of to strengthen the work . Afterwards one perceives at certain distances in divers places , especially where the strongest buttresses were to be , several other bricks of the same size , but more solid and burnt in a kiln , and set in good lime , or bitumen , nevertheless the greatest number consists of those which are only dried in the sun .</p>
   <p>I make no doubt but this ruin was the ancient Babel , and the tower of Nimrod ; for besides the evidence of its situation , it is acknowledged to be such by the people of the country , being vulgarly called Babil by the Arabs .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>The springs of bitumen called Oyun Hit , the fountains of Hit , are much celebrated by the Arabs and Persians ; the latter call it Cheshmeh kir , the fountain of pitch . This liquid bitumen they call Nafta ; and the Turks , to distinguish it from pitch , give it the name of hara sakiz , or black mastich . A Persian geographer says , that Nafta issues out of the springs of the earth as ambergrise issues out of those of the sea . All the modern travellers , except Rauwolf , who went to Persia and the Indies by the way of the Euphrates before the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope , mention this fountain of liquid bitumen as a strange thing . Some of them take notice of the river mentioned by Herodotus ; and assure us , that the people of the country have a tradition , that , when the tower of Babel was building , they brought the bitumen from hence ; which is confirmed by the Arab and Persian historians .</p>
   <p>Hit , Heit , Eit , Ait , or Idt , as it is variously written by travellers , is a great Turkish town situate upon the right or west side of the Euphrates ; and has a castle ; to the south-west of which and three miles from the town , in a valley , are many springs of this black substance ; each of which makes a noise like a smith 's forge , incessantly puffing and blowing out the matter so loud , that it may be heard a mile off : wherefore the Moors and Arabs call it Bab al Jehennam ; that is hell gate . It swallows up all heavy things ; and many camels from time to time fall into the pits , and are irrecoverably lost . It issues from a certain lake , sending forth a filthy smoke , and continually boiling over with the pitch ; which spreads itself over a great field , that is always full of it . It is free for every one to take : they use it to chaulk or pitch their boats , laying it on two or three inches thick ; which keeps out the water : with it also they pitch their houses , made of palm-tree branches . If it was not that the inundations of the Euphrates carry away the pitch , which covers all the sands from the place where it rises to the river , there would have been mountains of it long since . The very ground and stones thereabouts afford bitumen ; and the fields abundance of salt petre .</p>

The Devil now suggested a remedy , which was to quiet them by giving them every day the brains of two men , killed for that purpose : this tyranny lasted long , till a blacksmith of Ispahan whose children had been nearly all slain to feed the King 's serpents , raised his leathern apron as the standard of revolt , and deposed Zohak .

The account of it , and the mode of preparation , appears to have been given by a judge : in the latter there is a striking resemblance to the charm in Macbeth .</p>
   <p>Of the Hand of Glory , which is made use of by housebreakers , to enter into houses at night , without fear of opposition .</p>
   <p>I acknowledge that I never tried the secret of the Hand of Glory , but I have thrice assisted at the definitive judgment of certain criminals , who , under the torture , confessed having used it . Being asked what it was , how they procured it , and what were its uses and properties ? they answered , first , that the use of the Hand of Glory was to stupify those to whom it was presented , and to render them motionless , insomuch that they could not stir , any more than if they were dead ; secondly , that it was the hand of a hanged man ; and thirdly , that it must be prepared in the manner following .</p>
   <p>Take the hand , left or right , of a person hanged and exposed on the highway ; wrap it up in a piece of a shroud or winding sheet , in which let it be well squeezed , to get out any small quantity of blood that may have remained in it ; then put it into an earthen vessel with Zimat saltpetre , salt , and long pepper , the whole well powdered ; leave it fifteen days in that vessel ; afterwards take it out , and expose it to the noontide sun in the dog days , till it is thoroughly dry , and if the Sun is not sufficient , put it into an oven heated with fern and vervain . Then compose a kind of candle with the fat of a hanged man , virgin wax , and sisame of Lapland . The Hand of Glory is used as a candlestick to hold this candle , when lighted . Its properties are , that wheresoever any one goes with this dreadful instrument , the persons to whom it is presented will be deprived of all power of motion . On being asked if there was no remedy or antidote , to counteract this charm , they said the Hand of Glory would cease to take effect , and thieves could not make use of it , if the threshold of the door of the house , and other places by which they might enter , were anointed with an unguent composed of the gall of a black cat , the fat of a white hen , and the blood of a screech owl , which mixture must necessarily be prepared during the dog days .</p>

Some of them possess , close to their houses , gardens , trees , or cultivated grounds , and particularly some spring or well of water . I was once travelling in the south in the beginning of October , when the season happened to be exceedingly hot , and the wells and rivulets of the country were all dried up . We had neither water , for ourselves , nor for our horses ; and after having taken much fruitless trouble to obtain some , we went and paid homage to a Saint , who at first pretended a variety of scruples before he would suffer infidels to approach ; but on promising to give him ten or 12 shillings , he became exceedingly humane , and supplied us with as much water as we wanted ; still however vaunting highly of his charity , and particularly of his disinterestedness .</p>

Those who are grown up , carry always about with them some paragraph or other of their Koran , which , like as the Jews did their phylacteries , they place upon their breast , or sow under their caps , to prevent fascination and witchcraft , and to secure themselves from sickness and misfortunes . The virtue of these charms and scrolls is supposed likewise to be so far universal , that they suspend them upon the necks of their cattle , horses and other beasts of burthen .</p>

For it was sometimes globular , or like the flame of a candle ; immediately after it would spread itself and involve our whole company in its pale inoffensive light , then at once contract itself and disappear . But in less than a minute it would again exert itself as at other times , or else , running along from one place to another with a swift progressive motion , would expand itself , at certain intervals over more than two or three acres of the adjacent mountains . The atmosphere from the beginning of the evening , had been remarkably thick and hazy , and the dew , as we felt it upon our bridles , was unusually clammy and unctuous .

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 110 ]</span>The Hammam Meskouteen , the Silent or Inchanted Baths , are situated on a low ground , surrounded with mountains . There are several fountains that furnish the water , which is of an intense heat , and falls afterwards into the Ze-nati . At a small distance from these hot fountains , we have others , which upon comparison are of as an intense a coldness ; and a little below them , somewhat nearer the banks of the Ze-nati , there are the ruins of a few houses , built perhaps for the conveniency of such persons , who came hither for the benefit of the waters .</p>
   <p>Besides the strong sulphureous steams of the Hammam [ j ] Meskouteen , we are to observe farther of them , that their water is of so intense a heat , that the rocky ground it runs over , to the distance sometimes of a hundred foot , is dissolved , or rather calcined by it . When the substance of these rocks is soft and uniform , then the water by making every way equal impressions , leaveth them in the shape of cones or hemispheres ; which being six foot high and a little more or less of the same diameter , the Arabs maintain to be so many tents of their predecessors turned into stone . But when these rocks , besides their usual soft chalky substance , contain likewise some layers of harder matter , not so easy to be dissolved , then , in proportion to the resistance the water is thereby to meet with , we are entertained with a confusion of traces and channels , distinguished by the Arabs into Sheep , Camels , Horses , nay into Men , Women and Children , whom they suppose to have undergone the like fate with their habitations . I observed that the fountains which afforded this water , had been frequently stopped up : or rather ceasing to run at one place , broke out immediately in another , which circumstance seems not only to account for the number of cones , but for that variety likewise of traces , that are continued from one or other of these cones or fountains , quite down to the river Zenati .</p>

   <p>There are other natural curiosities likewise at this place . For the chalky stone being dissolved into a fine impalpable powder and carried down afterwards with the stream , lodgeth itself upon the sides of the channel , nay sometimes upon the lips of the fountains themselves ; or else embracing twigs , straws and other bodies in its way , immediately hardeneth and shoots into a bright fibrous substance , like the Asbestos , forming itself at the same time , into a variety of glittering figures and beautiful christalizations .</p>

These cellars are square rooms , to which you descend by only two or three steps . In the middle is a small cistern of water , and a rich carpet covers the ground from the walls to the cistern . At the four corners of the cistern are four large glass bottles , each containing about twenty quarts of wine , one white , another red . From one to the other of these , smaller bottles are ranged of the same material and form , that is , round with a long neck , holding about four or five quarts , white and red alternately . Round the cellar are several rows of niches in the wall , and in each nich is a bottle also of red and white alternately .— Some niches are made to hold two . Some windows give light to the apartment , and all these bottles so well ranged with their various colours have a very fine effect to the eye .

Within this wall there were the fairest and most chrystall fountaines in the whole world : and about the sayd fountaines there were most beautiful virgins in great number , and goodly horses also , and in a word every thing that could be devised for bodily solace and delight , and therefore the inhabitants of the countrey call the same place by the name of Paradise .</p>

This Senex , when he hath a minde to revenge himselfe , or to slay any king or baron , commandeth him that is governor of the sayd paradise , to bring thereunto some of the acquaintance of the sayd king or baron , permitting him awhile to take his pleasure therein , and then to give him a certeine potion being of force to cast him into such a slumber as should make him quite voide of all sense , and so being in a profound sleepe to convey him out of his paradise : who being awaked , and seeing himselfe thrust out of the paradise , would become so sorrowfull , that he could not in the world devise what to do , or whither to turne him . Then would he go unto the foresaide old man , beseeching him that he might be admitted againe into his paradise : who saith unto him , you cannot be admitted thither , unlesse you will slay such or such a man for my sake , and if you will give the attempt onely whether you kill him or no , I wil place you againe in paradise , that there you may remaine alwayes : then would the party without faile put the same in execution , indevouring to murther all those against whom the sayd olde man had conceived any hatred . And therefore all the kings of the east stood in awe of the sayd olde man , and gave unto him great tribute .</p>
   <p>And when the Tartars had subdued a great part of the world , they came unto the sayd olde man , and tooke from him the custody of his paradise : who being incensed thereat , sent abroad divers desperate and resolute persons out of his forenamed paradise , and caused many of the Tartarian nobles to be slaine . The Tartars seeing this , went and besieged the city wherein the sayd olde man was , tooke him , and put him to a most cruell and ignominious death .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 138 ]</span>As the celestial Apostle , at his retreat from Medina , did not perform always the five canonical prayers at the precise time , his disciples , who often neglected to join with him in the Namaz , assembled one day to fix upon some method of announcing to the public those moments of the day and night when their master discharged this first of religious duties . Flags , bells , trumpets , and fire were successively proposed as signals . None of these , however , were admitted . The flags were rejected as unsuited to the sanctity of the object ; the bells , on account of their being used by Christians ; the trumpets , as appropriated to the Hebrew worship ; the fire , as having too near an analogy to the religion of the pyrolators . From this contrariety of opinions the disciples separated without any determination . But one of them , Abdullah ibn Zeid Abderiye , saw the night following , in a dream , a celestial being clothed in green : he immediately requested his advice , with the most zealous earnestness , respecting the object in dispute . I am come to inform you , replied the heavenly visitor , how to discharge this important duty of your religion . He then ascended to the roof of the house , and declared the Ezann with a loud voice , and in the same words which have been ever since used to declare the canonical periods . When he awoke , Abdullah ran to declare his vision to the prophet , who loaded him with blessings , and authorized that moment Bilal Habeschy , another of his disciples , to discharge , on the top of his house , that august office , by the title of Muzzinn .</p>
   <p>These are the words of the Ezann : Most high God ! most high God ! most high God ! I acknowledge that there is no other except God ; I acknowledge that there is no other except God ! I acknowledge that Mohammed is the Prophet of God ! come to prayer ! come to prayer ! come to the temple of salvation ! Great God ! great God ! there is no God except God .</p>
   <p>This declaration must be the same for each of the five canonical periods , except that of the morning , when the Muezzinn ought to add , after the words , come to the temple of salvation , the following : prayer is to be preferred to sleep , prayer is to be preferred to sleep .</p>
   <p>This addition was produced by the zeal and piety of Bilal Habeschy : as he announced one day the Ezann of the dawn in the prophet 's antichamber , Aische in a whisper informed him , that the celestial envoy was still asleep ; this first of the Muezzinns then added these words , prayer is to be preferred to sleep : when he awoke the prophet applauded him , and commanded Bilal to insert them in all the morning Ezanns .</p>
   <p>The words must be chanted , but with deliberation and gravity , those particularly which constitute the profession of the faith . The Muezzinn must pronounce them distinctly ; he must pay more attention to the articulation of the words than to the melody of his voice ; he must make proper intervals and pauses , and not precipitate his words , but let them be clearly understood by the people . He must be interrupted by no other object whatever . During the whole Ezann he must stand , with a finger in each ear , and his face turned , as in prayer , towards the Keabe of Mecca . As he utters these words , come to prayer , come to the temple of salvation , he must turn his face to the right and left , because he is supposed to address all the nations of the world , the whole expanded universe . At this time the auditors must recite with a low voice the Tehhlil . There is no strength , there is no power , but what is in God , in that supreme Being , in that powerful Being .</p>

   <p>We have had in this country a new scene of Vampirism , which is duly attested by two officers of the Tribunal of Belgrade , who took cognizance of the affair on the spot , and by an officer in his Imperial Majesty 's troops at Gradisch ( in Sclavonia ) who was an eye-witness of the proceedings .</p>
   <p>In the beginning of September there died at the village of Kisilova , three leagues from Gradisch , an old man of above threescore and two : three days after he was buried he appeared in the night to his son , and desired he would give him somewhat to eat , and then disappeared . The next day the son told his neighbours these particulars . That night the Father did not come , but the next evening he made him another visit , and desired something to eat . It is not known whether his son gave him any thing or not , but the next morning the young man was found dead in his bed . The Magistrate or Bailiff of the place had notice of this , as also that the same day five or six persons fell sick in the village , and died one after the other . He sent an exact account of this to the tribunal of Belgrade , and thereupon two commissioners were dispatched to the village attended by an executioner , with instructions to examine closely into the affair . An officer in the Imperial service , from whom we have this relation , went also from Gradiseh , in order to examine personally an affair of which he had heard so much . They opened in the first place the graves of all who had been buried in six weeks . When they came to that of the old man , they found his eyes open , his colour fresh , his respiration quick and strong , yet he appeared to be stiff and insensible . From these signs they concluded him to be a notorious Vampire . The executioner thereupon , by the command of the commissioners , struck a stake thro ’ his heart ; and when he had so done , they made a bonfire , and therein consumed the carcase to ashes . There was no marks of Vampirism found on his son , or on the bodies of the other persons who died so suddenly .</p>

   <p>In a certain town of Hungary , which is called in Latin Oppida Heidonum , on the other side Tibiscus , vulgarly called the Teysse ; that is to say , the river which washes the celebrated territory of Tokay as also a part of Transilvania . The people known by the name of Heydukes believe that certain dead persons , whom they call Vampires , suck the blood of the living , insomuch that these people appear like skeletons , while the dead bodies of the suckers are so full of blood , that it runs out at all the passages of their bodies , and even at their very pores . This odd opinion of theirs they support by a multitude of facts attested in such a manner , that they leave no room for doubt . We shall here mention some of the most considerable .</p>
   <p>It is now about five years ago , that a certain Heyduke , an inhabitant of the village of Medreiga , whose name was Arnold Paul , was bruised to death by a hay-cart , which ran over him . Thirty days after his death , no less than four persons died suddenly , in that manner , wherein , according to the tradition of the country , those people generally die who are sucked by Vampires . Upon this a story was called to mind , that this Arnold Paul had told in his life-time , viz : that at Cossova on the Frontiers of the Turkish Servia , he had been tormented by a Vampire ; ( now the established opinion is that a person sucked by a Vampire , becomes a Vampire himself , and sucks in his turn . ) But that he had found a way to rid himself of this evil , by eating some of the earth out of the Vampire 's grave , and rubbing himself with his blood . This precaution however did not hinder his becoming a Vampire ; insomuch that his body being taken up forty days after his death , all the marks of a notorious Vampire were found thereon . His complexion was fresh , his hair , nails and beard were grown ; he was full of fluid blood , which ran from all parts of his body upon his shroud . The Hadnagy or Bailiff of the place , who was a person well acquainted with Vampirism , caused a sharp stake to be thrust , as the custom is , through the heart of Arnold Paul , and also quite through his body ; whereupon he cried out dreadfully as if he had been alive . This done , they cut off his head , burnt his body , and threw the ashes thereof into Saave . They took the same measures with the bodies of those persons who had died of Vampirism , for fear that they should fall to sucking in their turns .</p>
   <p>All these prudent steps did not hinder the same mischief from breaking out again about five years afterwards , when several people in the same village died in a very odd manner . In the space of three months , seventeen persons of all ages and sexes died of Vampirism , some suddenly , and some after two or three days suffering . Amongst others there was one Stanoska , the daughter of a Heyduke whose name was Jovitzo who going to bed in perfect health , waked in the middle of the night , and making a terrible outcry , affirmed that the son of a certain Heyduke whose name was Millo , and who had been dead about three weeks , had attempted to strangle her in her sleep . She continued from that time in a languishing condition , and in the space of three days died . What this girl had said discovered the son of Millo to be a Vampire . They took up the body and found him so in effect . The principal persons of the place , particularly the Physician and Surgeons , began to examine very narrowly , how , in spite of all their precautions , Vampirism had again broke out in so terrible a manner . After a strict inquisition , they found that the deceased Arnold Paul had not only sucked the four persons before mentioned , but likewise several beasts , of whom the new Vampires had eaten , particularly the son of Millo . Induced by these circumstances , they took a resolution , of digging up the bodies of all persons who had died within a certain time . They did so , and amongst forty bodies , there were found seventeen evidently Vampires . Through the hearts of these they drove stakes , cut off their heads , burnt the bodies , and threw the ashes into the river . All the informations we have been speaking of were taken in a legal way , and all the executions were so performed , as appears by certificates drawn up in full form , attested by several officers in the neighbouring garrisons , by the surgeons of several Regiments , and the principal inhabitants of the place . The verbal process was sent towards the latter end of last January to the council of war at Vienna , who thereupon established a special commission to examine into these facts . Those just now mentioned were attested by the Hadnagi Barriarer , the principal Heyduke of the village , as also by Battuer , first Lieutenant of Prince Alexander of Wirtemberg , Flickstenger , surgeon major of the regiment of Furstemberg , three other surgeons of the same regiment , and several other persons .</p>
   <p>A similar superstition prevails in Greece . The man whose story we are going to relate , was a Peasant of Mycone , naturally ill natured and quarrelsome , this is a circumstance to be taken notice of in such cases . He was murdered in the fields , nobody knew how , or by whom . Two days after his being buried in a Chapel in the town , it was noised about that he was seen to walk in the night with great haste , that he tumbled about people 's goods , put out their lamps , griped them behind , and a thousand other monkey tricks . At first the story was received with laughter ; but the thing was looked upon to be serious when the better sort of people began to complain of it ; the Papas themselves gave credit to the fact , and no doubt had their reasons for so doing ; masses must be said , to be sure : but for all this , the Peasant drove his old trade and heeded nothing they could do . After divers meetings of the chief people of the city , of priests , and monks , it was gravely concluded , that ‘ twas necessary in consequence of some musty ceremonial to wait till nine days after the interment should be expired .</p>
   <p>On the tenth day they said one mass in the chapel where the body was laid , in order to drive out the Demon which they imagined was got into it . After mass they took up the body , and got every thing ready for pulling out its heart . The butcher of the town , an old clumsy fellow , first opens the belly instead of the breast , he groped a long while among the entrails , but could not find what he looked for ; at last somebody told him he should cut up the Diaphragm . The heart was then pulled out , to the admiration of all the spectators . In the mean time the Corpse stunk so abominably that they were obliged to burn frankincense ; but the smoke mixing with the exhalations from the carcass increased the stink , and began to muddle the poor people 's pericranies . Their imagination , struck with the spectacle before them , grew full of visions . It came into their noddles , that a thick smoke came out of the body ; we durst not say ‘ twas the smoke of the incense . They were incessantly bawling out Vroucolacas in the chapel and place before it ; this is the name they give to these pretended Redivivi . The noise bellowed thro ’ the streets , and it seemed to be a name invented on purpose to rend the roof of the chapel . Several there present averr 'd that the wretches blood was extremely red ; the Butcher swore the body was still warm , whence they concluded that the Deceas 'd was a very ill man for not being thoroughly dead , or in plain terms for suffering himself to be re-animated by Old Nick ; which is the notion they have of Vroucolacas . They then roar 'd out that name in a stupendous manner . Just at this time came in a flock of people loudly protesting they plainly perceived the Body was not grown stiff when it was carried from the fields to Church to be buried , and that consequently it was a true Vroucolacas ; which word was still the burden of the song .</p>
   <p>I do n't doubt they would have sworn it did not stink , had not we been there ; so mazed were the poor people with this disaster , and so infatuated with their notion of the Dead being re-animated . As for us , who were got as close to the corpse as we could , that we might be more exact in our observations , we were almost poisoned with the intolerable stink that issued from it . When they asked us what we thought of this body , we told them we believed it to be very thoroughly dead : but as we were willing to cure , or at least not to exasperate their prejudiced imaginations , we represented to them , that it was no wonder the butcher should feel a little warmth when he groped among Entrails that were then rotting , that it was no extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes , since dung turned up will do the same ; that as for the pretended redness of the blood , it still appeared by the butcher 's hands to be nothing but a very stinking nasty smear .</p>
   <p>After all our reasons they were of opinion it would be their wisest course to burn the dead man 's heart on the sea-shore : but this execution did not make him a bit more tractable ; he went on with his racket more furiously than ever ; he was accused of beating folks in the night , breaking down doors , and even roofs of houses , clattering windows , tearing clothes , emptying bottles and vessels . ‘ Twas the most thirsty Devil ! I believe he did not spare any body but the Consul in whose house we lodged . Nothing could be more miserable than the condition of this island ; all the inhabitants seemed frighted out of their senses : the wisest among them were stricken like the rest ; ‘ twas an epidemical disease of the brain , as dangerous and infectious as the madness of dogs . Whole families quitted their houses , and brought their tent beds from the farthest parts of the town into the public place , there to spend the night . They were every instant complaining of some new insult ; nothing was to be heard but sighs and groans at the approach of night : the better sort of people retired into the country .</p>
   <p>When the prepossession was so general , we thought it our best way to hold our tongues . Had we opposed it , we had not only been accounted ridiculous blockheads , but Atheists and Infidels , how was it possible to stand against the madness of a whole people ? Those that believed we doubted the truth of the fact , came and upbraided us with our incredulity , and strove to prove that there were such things as Vroucolacasses , by citations out of the Buckler of Faith , written by F. Richard a Jesuit Missionary . He was a Latin , say they , and consequently you ought to give him credit . We should have got nothing by denying the justness of the consequence : it was as good as a Comedy to us every morning to hear the new follies committed by this night bird ; they charged him with being guilty of the most abominable sins .</p>
   <p>Some Citizens , that were most zealous for the good of the public , fancied they had been deficient in the most material part of the ceremony . They were of opinion that they had been wrong in saying mass before they had pulled out the wretches heart : had we taken this precaution , quoth they , we had bit the Devil as sure as a gun ; he would have been hanged before he would ever have come there again : whereas saying mass first , the cunning Dog fled for it awhile and came back again when the danger was over .</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding these wise reflections , they remained in as much perplexity as they were the first day : they meet night and morning , they debate , they make professions three days and three nights , they oblige the Papas to fast ; you might see them running from house to house , holy-water-brush in hand sprinkling it all about , and washing the doors with it ; nay they poured it into the mouth of the poor Vroucolacas .</p>
   <p>We so often repeated it to the Magistrates of the town , that in Xtendom we should keep the strictest watch a nights upon such an occasion , to observe what was done ; that at last they caught a few vagabonds , who undoubtedly had a hand in these disorders : but either they were not the chief ringleaders , or else they were released too soon . For two days afterwards , to make themselves amends for the Lent they had kept in prison , they fell foul again upon the wine tubs of those who were such fools as to leave their houses empty in the night : so that the people were forced to betake themselves again to their prayers .</p>
   <p>One day as they were hard at this work , after having stuck I know not how many naked swords over the grave of this corpse , which they took up three or four times a day , for any man 's whim ; an Albaneze that happened to be at Mycone , took upon him to say with a voice of authority , that it was to the last degree ridiculous to make use of the swords of Xtians in a case like this . Can you not conceive , blind as ye are , says he , that the handles of these swords being made like a cross , hinders the Devil from coming out of the body ? Why do you not rather take the Turkish sabres ? The advice of this learned man had no effect : the Vroucolacas was incorrigible , and all the inhabitants were in a strange consternation ; they knew not now what Saint to call upon , when of a sudden with one voice , as if they had given each other the hint , they fell to bawling out all thro ’ the city , that it was intolerable to wait any longer ; that the only way left was to burn the Vroucolacas intire ; that after so doing , let the Devil lurk in it if he could ; that ‘ twas better to have recourse to this extremity than to have the island totally deserted , and indeed whole families began to pack up , in order to retire to Syre or Tinos . The magistrates therefore ordered the Vroucolacas to be carryed to the point of the island St. George , where they prepared a great pile with pitch and tar , for fear the wood , as dry as it was , should not burn fast enough of itself . What they had before left of this miserable carcass was thrown into this fire and consumed presently : ‘ twas on the first of January , 1701 . We saw the flame as we returned from Delos ; it might justly be called a bonfire of joy , since after this no more complaints were heard against the Vroucolacas ; they said that the Devil had now met with his match , and some ballads were made to turn him into ridicule .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 146 ]</span>The hawk is used at Aleppo in taking the hare . “ As soon as the hare is put up , one , or a brace of the nearest greyhounds are slipped , and the Falconer galloping after them , throws off his hawk . The hare cannot run long where the hawk behaves properly , but sometimes getting the start of the dogs , she gains the next hill and escapes . It now and then happens when the hawk is fierce and voracious in an unusual degree , that the hare is struck dead at the first stroke , but that is very uncommon ; for the hawks preferred for hare hunting are taught to pounce and buffet the game , not to seize it , and they rise a little between each attack , to descend again with fresh force . In this manner the game is confused and retarded , till the greyhounds come in .</p>
   <p>Russell .</p>
   <p>The Shaheen or Falcon Gentle , flies at a more dangerous game . Were there not , says the elder Russell , several gentlemen now in England to bear witness to the truth of what I am going to relate , I should hardly venture to assert that with this bird , which is about the size of a pigeon , they sometimes take large Eagles . The Hawk in former times was taught to seize the Eagle under his pinion , and thus depriving him of the use of one wing , both birds fell to the ground together : but I am informed the present mode is to teach the Hawk to fix on the back between the wings , which has the same effect , only that the bird tumbling down more slowly , the Falconer has more time to come in to his Hawk 's assistance ; but in either case , if he be not very expeditious , the Falcon is inevitably destroyed .</p>
   <p>Dr. Patrick Russell says , this sport was disused in his time , probably from its ending more frequently in the death of the Falcon than of the Eagle . But he had often seen the Shaheen take Herons and Storks . “ The hawk when thrown off flies for some time in a horizontal line not six feet from the ground , then mounting perpendicularly with astonishing swiftness , he seizes his prey under the wing , and both together come tumbling to the ground . If the Falconer is not expeditious the game soon disengages itself .</p>
   <p>We saw about twenty antelopes , which , however , were so very shy , that we could not get near enough to have a shot , nor do I think it possible to take them without hawks , the mode usually practised in those countries . The swiftest greyhounds would be of no use , for the antelopes are much swifter of foot than any animal I ever saw before .</p>

   <p>The Persians train their hawks thus . They take the whole skin of a stag , of the head , body , and legs , and stuff it with straw to the shape of the animal . After fixing it in the place where they usually train the bird , they place his food upon the head of the stuffed stag , and chiefly in the two cavities of the eyes , that the Bird may strike there . Having accustomed him for several days to eat in this manner , they fasten the feet of the stag to a plank which runs upon wheels , which is drawn by cords from a distance ; and from day to day they draw it faster , insensibly to accustom the Bird not to quit his prey ; and at last they draw the stag by a horse at full speed . They do the same with the wild boar , the ass , the fox , the hare , and other beasts of chase .— They are even taught to stop a horseman at full speed , nor will they quit him till the Falconer recalls them and shows them their food .</p>

   <p>I do not recollect in what history or romance there is a tale of two dogs trained in this manner to destroy a Tyrant . But I believe it is an historical fiction . The farmers in Norway believe that the Eagle will sometimes attack a deer , in this enterprize he makes use of this stratagem ; he soaks his wings in water , and then covers them with sand and gravel , with which he flies against the deer 's face , and blinds him for a time ; the pain of this sets him running about like a distracted creature , and frequently he tumbles down a rock or some steep place , and breaks his neck ; thus he becomes a prey to the eagle .</p>

   <p>The Kings of Persia are very fond of the chase , and it is principally in that , that they display their magnificence . It happened one day that Cha-Sefi wished to entertain all the Ambassadors who were at his court , and there were then ministers there from Tartary , Muscovy and India . He led them to the chase , and having taken in their presence a great number of large animals , stags , does , hinds and wild boars , he had them all dressed and eat the same day , and while they were eating an Architect was ordered to erect a tower in the middle of Ispahan , only with the heads of these animals : the remains of it are yet to be seen . When the Tower was raised to its proper height , the Architect came exultingly to the King who was then at the banquet with the Ambassadors , and informed him that nothing was wanting to finish the work well , but the head of some large beast for the point . The Prince in his drunkenness , and with a design of showing the Ambassadors how absolute he was over his subjects , turned sternly to the Architect — You are right , said he , and I do not know where to find a better head than your own . The unhappy man was obliged to lose his head , and the royal order was immediately executed .</p>

Several provinces produce it , but that of Huquam exceeds all the others , as well in quantity as whiteness . It is gathered in the province of Xantung upon little trees ; but in that of Huquam upon large ones , as big as those of the Indian Pagods , or chesnut-trees in Europe . The way nature has found to produce it , to us appears strange enough . There is in this province a creature , or insect of the bigness of a flea , so sharp at stinging , that it not only pierces the skins of men and beasts , but the boughs and bodies of the trees . Those of the province of Xantung are much valued ; where the inhabitants gather their eggs from the trees , and carry them to sell in the province of Huquam . In the spring , there come from these eggs certain worms , which about the beginning of the summer they place at the foot of the tree , whence they creep up , spreading themselves wonderfully over all the branches . Having placed themselves there , they gnaw , pierce , and bore to the very pith , and their nourishment they convert into wax as white as snow , which they drive out to the mouth of the hole they have made , where it remains congealed in drops by the wind , and cold .

Immediately she sprung from the bed , not that she was shocked or terrified at the sight , for the Arabian women were accustomed to follow the army , and habituated to the sight of blood and massacre . But Hosein by Fatima his mother was grandson of the prophet , and this produced an astonishing effect upon the mind of the woman . By the Apostle of God , she exclaimed , I will never again lie down with a man who has brought me the head of his grandson .

   <p>The balsam tree is nearly of the same size as a sprig of myrtle , and its leaves are like those of the herb sweet-marjoram . Vipers take up their residence about these plants , and are in some places more numerous than in others ; for the juice of the balsam tree is their sweetest food , and they are delighted with the shade produced by its leaves . When the time therefore arrives for gathering the juice of this Tree , the Arabians come into the sacred grove , each of them holding two twigs , by shaking these , they put to flight the Vipers ; for they are unwilling to kill them , because they consider them as the sacred inhabitants of the balsam . And if it happens that any one is wounded by a Viper , the wound resembles that which is made by iron , but is not attended with any dangerous consequences ; for these animals being fed with the juice of the balsam tree , which is the most odoriferous of all trees , their poison becomes changed from a deadly quality into one which produces a milder effect .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 156 ]</span>The Persians are strangely superstitious about the burial of their Kings . For fearing lest by some magical art any enchantments should be practised upon their bodies to the prejudice of their children , they conceal , as much as in them lies , the real place of interment .</p>
   <p>To this end they send to several places several coffins of lead , with others of wood , which they call Taboat , and bury all alike with the same magnificence . In this manner they delude the curiosity of the people , who cannot discern by the outside in which of the coffins the real body should be . Not but it might be discovered by such as would put themselves to the expence and trouble of doing it . And thus it shall be related in the life of Habas the great , that twelve of these coffins were conveyed to twelve of the principal Mosques , not for the sake of their riches , but of the person which they enclosed ; and yet nobody knew in which of the twelve the King 's body was laid , tho ’ the common belief is , that it was deposited at Ardevil .</p>
   <p>It is also said in the life of Sefie I. that there were three coffins carried to three several places , as if there had been a triple production from one body , tho ’ it were a thing almost certainly known , that the coffin where the body was laid , was carried to this same city of Kom , and to the same place where the deceased King commanded the body of his deceased father to be carried .</p>

   <p>They imagine the dead are capable of pain , a Portugueze gentleman had one day ignorantly strayed among the tombs , and a Moor , after much wrangling obliged him to go before the Cadi . The gentleman complained of violence and asserted he had committed no crime , but the judge informed him he was mistaken , for that the poor dead suffered when trodden on by Christian feet . Muley Ishmael once had occasion to bring one of his wives thro ’ a burial ground , and the people removed the bones of their relations , and murmuring said he would neither suffer the living nor the dead to rest in peace .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 160 ]</span>A Physician of Ragusa was deputed by that little Republic to negotiate with the Emperor of the Turks . Before he embarked on this voyage he took into his service a boy of a red complection , the only son of a widow , a poor woman , but a woman of honour and virtuous . This Envoy on his arrival at Constantinople immediately addressed himself to the first Physician of his imperial highness , that thro ’ his favour he might have more access to negociate for his country . The Mahometan had no sooner set eyes on the young Ragusan , than he employed every artifice to induce his master to leave him . The boy himself , at last , wishing to remain at Constantinople , flattered by the fair prospects that were held out to him , and touched with a tender and heroic compassion for her who had given him birth , prayed his protector to leave him with the Barbarian , and carry to his mother the money which on that account he would receive : So that the Ragusan physician left his servant to the Byzantian , and received from him a purse of a thousand sequins . After some days the Italian went to take leave of the Mohammedan Physician , and to thank him for his favours ; and he requested earnestly to see the red-headed boy before his departure . The Turk was obliged to own he had made poison of him , and led him into a chamber where the naked body of the boy was still suspended by the feet . The first master of the red-headed boy was greatly surprized at the sight and still more so when he heard that the boy had been beaten upon the belly for six hours , by slaves who relieved one another , till he died : and that a poison was made of the last foam that came from his mouth , so penetrating , that if the stirrup of a horse were touched with the point of a pin that had been dipt in it , he who should mount would immediately die .</p>

   <p>In this volume the pleadings of the Mother against the Ragusan physician , and his defence are given . The Mother says , it is impossible that he , being a Physician himself , should not have known for what the Infidel Physician wanted to purchase a red-headed boy , as he himself would have made the same use of him had he not been afraid of the laws , the rest is in the usual stile of Tristan 's rhetoric .</p>
   <p>As the Moslem employed a red-headed Christian in this manufactory , it should seem that a Turk ought to be used in Christendom . But as Turks are not easily caught , a Jew might do .</p>
   <p>In the Islands of Barlovento and in all the country of Brazil , in Santa Marta and in the new kingdom , and in other countries , where a cruel sort of Indians inhabited , they used another sort of poison ; for they would take the leg of an Indian whom they had killed , and hang it up in the air against the sun , and fill it with many barbs of poisoned arrows , which were taken out of the flesh of an Indian , which after some days they took out , and without cleansing of them , they dried them in the air where the sun did not come , and then they headed their arrows with them ; and that became the most malevolent poison , and the most hard to be cured in the world . After the Spaniards came into that country and waged war upon the Indians , they then made it with the flesh of Spaniards , whom they killed or took ; but more particularly they desired the flesh of some red-headed Spaniard , whose hairs were of a deep saffron colour ; for they were of opinion that there was more heat in that flesh , and consequently more virulency in the poison which it produced : but perhaps they may have heard it often said amongst the Spaniards themselves , that red-headed men are fit to make a composition of poison .</p>

   <p>This creature , which is not only found in Brasil , but also in the Isle of Java , belonging to the East Indies , and which by our people is called Gekko , from its constant cry , ( like among us that of the Cuckoe ) is properly an Indian Salamander . It is about a foot long , its skin of of a pale or sea green colour , with red spots . The head is not unlike that of a tortoise , with a streight mouth . The eyes are very large , starting out of the head , with long and small eye-apples . The tail is distinguished by several white rings ; its teeth are so sharp as to make an impression even upon steel . Each of its four legs had five crooked claws aimed on the end with nails . Its gait is very slow , but wherever it fastens it is not easily removed . It dwells commonly upon rotten trees , or among the ruines of old houses and churches ; it oftentimes settles near the bedsteads , which makes sometimes the moors pull down their huts .</p>
   <p>Its constant cry is gekko , but before it begins it makes a kind of hissing noise . The sting of this creature is so venomous , that the wound proves mortal , unless it be immediately burnt with a red hot iron , or cut off . The blood is of a palish colour , resembling poison itself .</p>
   <p>The Javanese use to dip their arrows in the blood of this creature ; and those who deal in poisons among them , ( an art much esteemed in the island of Java , by both sexes ) hang it up with a string tied to the tail on the cieling , by which means it being exasperated to the highest pitch sends forth a yellow liquor out of its mouth , which they gather in small pots set underneath , and afterwards coagulate into a body in the sun . This they continue for several months together , by giving daily food to the creature . It is unquestionably the strongest poison in the world ; its urine being of so corrosive a quality , that it not only raises blisters , wherever it touches the skin , but turns the flesh black , and causes a gangrene .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 162 ]</span>When any person is to be buried , it is usual to bring the corpse at mid-day or afternoon prayers , to one or other of these Mosques , from whence it is accompanied by the greatest part of the congregation , to the grave . Their processions , at these times , are not so slow and solemn as in most parts of Christendom : for the whole company make what haste they can , singing as they go along , some select verses of their Coran . That absolute submission which they pay to the will of God , allows them not to use any consolatory words upon these occasions : no loss or misfortune is to be hereupon regretted or complained of : instead likewise of such expressions of sorrow and condolence , as may regard the deceased , the compliments turn upon the person , who is the nearest concerned , a blessing ( say his friends ) be upon your head .</p>

   <p>All Mahometans inter the dead at the hour set apart for prayer ; the defunct is not kept in the house , except he expires after sunset , but the Body is transported to the Mosque , whither it is carried by those who are going to prayer ; each from a spirit of devotion is desirous to carry in his turn . Women regularly go on Friday to weep over , and pray at the sepulchres of the dead , whose memory they hold dear .</p>

   <p>This custom of crowding about a funeral contributes to spread the plague in Turkey .— It is not many years since , in some parts of Worcestershire , the mourners were accustomed to kneel with their heads upon the coffin during the burial service .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">The fullest account of a Mohammedan funeral is in the Lettres sur la</l>
     <l n="2">Grece , of M. Guys . Chance made him the spectator of a ceremony which the</l>
     <l n="3">Moslem will not suffer an Infidel to prophane by his presence .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ About ten in the morning I saw the grave-digger at work ; the slaves and the women of the family were seated in the burial ground , many other women arrived , and then they all began to lament . After this prelude they one after the other embraced one of the little pillars which are placed upon the graves , crying out Ogloum , ogloum , soena Mussaphir gueldi , My Son , my Son , a guest is coming to see thee . At these words their tears and sobs began anew ; but the storm did not continue long ; they all seated themselves , and entered into conversation .</p>
   <p>At noon I heard a confused noise , and cries of lamentation , it was the funeral which arrived . A Turk preceded it , bearing upon his head a small chest ; four other Turks carried the bier upon their shoulders , then came the father , the relations and the friends of the dead in great numbers . Their cries ceased at the entrance of the burial ground , but then they quarrelled — and for this . The man who bore the chest opened it , it was filled with copies of the Koran , a croud of Turks , young and old , threw themselves upon the books and scrambled for them . Those who succeeded ranged themselves around the Iman , and all at once began to recite the Koran , almost as Boys say their lesson . Each of the readers received ten parats , about fifteen sols , wrapt in paper . It was then for these fifteen pence that these pious assistants had quarrelled , and in our own country you might have seen them fight for less .</p>
   <p>The bier was placed by the grave , in which the grave-digger was still working , and perfumes were burnt by it . After the reading of the Koran the Iman chanted some Arabic prayers , and his full-chant would , no doubt , have appeared to you , as it did to me , very ridiculous . All the Turks were standing ; they held their hands open over the grave , and answered Amen to all the prayers which the Iman addressed to God for the deceased .</p>
   <p>The prayers finished , a large chest was brought about six feet long and three broad ; its boards were very thick . The coffin is usually made of cypress ; thus literally is verified the phrase of Horace that the cypress is our last possession .</p>

     <l n="1">Neque harum , quas colis , arborum ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>The cemeteries of the Turks are usually planted with these trees , to which they have a religious attachment . The chest which was in loose pieces , having been placed in the grave , the coffin was laid in it , and above planks , with other pieces of wood . Then all the Turks , taking spades , cast earth upon the grave to cover it . This is a part of the ceremony at which all the bystanders assisted in their turn .</p>
   <p>Before the corpse is buried it is carried to the Mosque . Then after having recited the Fatka ( a prayer very similar to our Lord 's prayer , which is repeated by all present ) the Iman asks the congregation what they have to testify concerning the life and morals of the deceased . Each then in his turn relates those good actions with which he was acquainted . The body is then washed , and wrapped up like a mummy , so that it cannot be seen . Drugs and spices are placed in the bier with it , and it is carried to interment . Before it is lowered into the grave , the Iman commands silence , saying , “ Cease your lamentations for a moment , and let me instruct this Moslem how to act , when he arrives in the other world . ” Then in the ear of the corpse , he directs him how to answer the Evil Spirit who will not fail to question him respecting his religion , &amp; c. This lesson finished , he repeats the Fatka with all the assistants , and the body is let down into the grave . After they have thrown earth three times upon the grave , as the Romans used , they retire . The Iman only remains , he approaches the grave , stoops down , inclines his ear , and listens to hear if the Dead disputes when the Angel of Death comes to take him : then he bids him farewell , and in order to be well paid , never fails to report to the family the best news of the dead .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 163 ]</span>The Turks bury not at all within the walls of the city , but the great Turkish Emperors themselves , with their wives and children about them , and some few other of their great Bassaes , and those only in chappels by themselves built for that purpose .

     <l n="1"><span type="note_anchor">[ 165 ]</span>A strange account of the Cedars of Lebanon is given by De la</l>
     <l n="2">Roque . Voyage de Syrie &amp; du Mont Liban . 1722 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ This little forest is composed of twenty Cedars of a prodigious size , so large indeed that the finest Planes , Sycamores , and other large trees which we had seen could not be compared with them . Besides these principal Cedars , there were a great number of lesser ones , and some very small , mingled with the large trees , or in little clumps near them . They differed not in their foliage , which resembles the Juniper , and is green throughout the year : but the great Cedars spread at their summit and form a perfect round , whereas the small ones rise in a pyramidal form like the Cypress . Both diffuse the same pleasant odour ; the large ones only yield fruit , a large cone in shape almost like that of the Pine , but of a browner colour , and compacter shell . It gives a very pleasant odour , and contains a sort of thick and transparent balm , which oozes out thro ’ small apertures , and falls drop by drop . This fruit which it is difficult to separate from the stalk , contains a nut like that of the Cypress ; it grows at the end of the boughs , and turns its point upwards .</p>
   <p>The nature of this tree is not to elevate its trunk , or the part between the root and the first branches ; for the largest Cedars which we saw did not in the height of their trunks exceed six or seven feet . From this low but enormously thick body , prodigious branches rise , spreading as they rise , and forming by the disposition of their boughs and leaves which point upward , a sort of wheel which appears to be the work of art . The bark of the cedar , except at the trunk , is smooth and shining , of a brown colour . Its wood white and soft immediately under the bark , but hard and red within , and very bitter , which renders it incorruptible and almost immortal . A fragrant gum issues from the tree .</p>
   <p>The largest Cedar which we measured was seven feet in circumference , wanting two inches , and the whole extent of its branches , which it was easy to measure from their perfect roundness , formed a circumference of about 120 feet .</p>
   <p>The Patriarch of the Maronites , fully persuaded of the rarity of these Trees , and wishing by the preservation of those that remain to shew his respect for a forest so celebrated in Scripture has pronounced canonical pains , and even excommunication against any Christians who shall dare to cut them ; scarcely will he permit a little to be sometimes taken for Crucifixes and little tabernacles in the chapels of our Missionaries .</p>
   <p>The Maronites themselves have such a veneration for these Cedars , that on the day of Transfiguration they celebrate the festival under them with great solemnity , the Patriarch officiates and says Mass pontifically , and among other exercises of devotion they particularly honour the Virgin Mary there , and sing her praises , because she is compared to the Cedars of Lebanon , and Lebanon itself used as a metaphor for the mother of Christ .</p>
   <p>The Maronites say that the snows have no sooner begun to fall than these Cedars , whose boughs in their infinite number are all so equal in height that they appear to have been shorn , and form , as we have said , a sort of wheel or parasol ,— than these Cedars , I say , never fail at that time to change their figure . The branches which before spread themselves rise insensibly , gathering together it may be said , and turn their points upward towards Heaven , forming altogether a pyramid . It is Nature , they say , who inspires this movement , and makes them assume a new shape , without which these Trees never could sustain the immense weight of snow , remaining for so long a time .</p>
   <p>I have procured more particular information of this fact , and it has been confirmed by the testimony of many persons , who have often witnessed it . This is what the Secretary of the Maronite Patriarch wrote to me in one of his letters , which I think it right to give in his own words . Cedri Libani quas plantavit Deus , ut Psalmist : loquitur , sitae sunt in planitie quadam , aliquantulum infra altissimum Montis-Libani cacumen , ubi tempore hyemali maxima nivium quantitas descendit , tribusque &amp; ultra , mensibus mordaciter dominatur . Cedri in altum ascendunt extensis tamen ramis in gyrum solo parallelis , confioientibus suo gyro fere umbellam solarem . Sed superveniente nive , quia coacervaretur in magna quantitate eos desuper , neque possent pati tantum pondus tanto tempore premens , sine certo fractionis discrimine , Natura , rerum omnium provida mater , ipsis concessit , ut adveniente hyeme &amp; descendente nive , statim rami in altum assurgant , &amp; secum invicem uniti constituant quasi conum , ut melius sese ab adveniente hoste tueantur . Natura enim ipsa verum est , virtutem quamlebet unitam simul reddi fortiorem .</p>
   <p>The Cedars of Lebanon , which , as the Psalmist says , God himself planted , are situated in a little plain , somewhat below the loftiest summit of mount Lebanon , where in the winter a great quantity of snow falls , and continues for three months , or longer . The Cedars are high , but their boughs spread out parallel with the ground into a circle , forming almost a shield against the sun . But when the snow falls , which would be heaped upon them in so great a quantity , that they could not endure such a weight so long a time , without the certain danger of breaking , Nature , the provident mother of all , has endued them with power , that when the winter comes and the snow descends , their boughs immediately rise , and uniting together form a cone , that they may be the better defended from the coming Enemy . For in Nature itself it is true , that virtue as it is united , becomes stronger .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 167 ]</span>It is well known how much the Orientalists are addicted to this pretended science . There is a curious instance of public folly in Sir John Chardin 's travels .</p>
   <p>“ Sephie-Mirza was born in the year of the Egire 1057 . For the superstition of the Persians will not let us know the month or the day . Their addiction to Astrology is such that they carefully conceal the moments of their Princes birth , to prevent the casting their nativities , where they might meet perhaps with something which they should be unwilling to know . ”</p>
   <p>At the coronation of this Prince two Astrologers were to be present , with an Astrolabe in their hands , to take the fortunate hour , as they term it , and observe the lucky moments that a happy constellation should point out for proceedings of that importance .</p>
   <p>Sephie-Mirza having by debauchery materially injured his health , the Chief Physician was greatly alarmed , “ in regard his life depended upon the King 's , or if his life were spared yet he was sure to lose his estate and his liberty , as happens to all those who attend the Asiatic Sovereigns , when they die under their care . The Queen Mother too accused him of treason or ignorance , believing that since he was her Son 's Physician he was obliged to cure him . This made the Physician at his wits end , so that all his receipts failing him , he bethought himself of one that was peculiarly his own invention , and which few physicians would ever have found out , as not being to be met with neither in Galen nor Hippocrates . What does he then do , but out of an extraordinary fetch of his wit , he begins to lay the fault upon the stars and the King 's Astrologers , crying out that they were altogether in the wrong , that if the King lay in a languishing condition and could not recover his health it was because they had failed to observe the happy hour , or the Aspect of a fortunate constellation at the time of his coronation . ” The stratagem succeeded , the King was recrowned and by the new name of Solyman !</p>

The same thing is affirmed by Bartholomew Sibillus , and the Author of the Image of the World , of Virgil ; by William of Malmsbury of Sylvester ; by John Gower of Robert of Lincoln ; by the common people of England of Roger Bacon ; and by Tostatus Bishop of Avilla , George of Venice , Delrio , Sibillus , Raguseus , Delancre and others , too many to mention , of Albertus Magnus ; who as the most expert , had made an entire man of the same metal , and had spent thirty years without any interruption in forming him under several aspects and constellations . For example , he formed the eyes , according to the said Tostatus in his commentaries upon Exodus , when the Sun was in a sign of the Zodiac correspondent to that part , casting them out of divers metals mixt together and mark 'd with the characters of the same signs and planets , and their several and necessary aspects . The same method he observed in the head , neck , shoulders , thighs , and legs , all which were fashioned at several times , and being put and fastened together in the form of a man , had the faculty to reveal to the said Albertus the solutions of all his principal difficulties . To which they add ( that nothing be lost of the story of the statue ) that it was battered to pieces by St. Thomas , meerely because he could not endure its excesse of prating .</p>
   <p>But to give a more rational account of this Androides of Albertus , as also of all these miraculous heads , I conceive the original of this fable may well be deduced from the Teraph of the Hebrews , by which as Mr. Selden affirms , many are of opinion , that we must understand what is said in Genesis concerning Laban 's Gods , and in the first book of Kings concerning the image which Michol put into the bed in David 's place . For R. Eleazar holds that it was made of the head of a male child , the first born and that dead-born , under whose tongue they applyed a lamen of Gold , whereon were engraved the characters and inscriptions of certain planets , which the Jews superstitiously wandered up and down with , instead of the Urim and Thummim , or the Ephod of the High Priest . And that this original is true and well deduced , there is a manifest indicium , in that Henry D'Assia , and Bartholomaeus Sibillus affirm , that the Androides of Albertus , and the Head made by Virgil , were composed of flesh and bone , yet not by nature , but by art . But this being judged impossible by modern Authors , and the vertue of Images , Annulets , and planetary Sigills being in great reputation , men have thought ever since ( taking their opinion from Trismegistus affirming in his Asclepion , that of the Gods , some were made by the Sovereign God , and others by men , who , by some art , had the power to unite the invisible Spirits to things visible and corporeal , as is explained at large by St. Augustine ) that such figures were made of copper or some other metal , whereon men had wrought under some favourable Aspects of Heaven and the planets .</p>
   <p>My design is not absolutely to deny that he might compose some head or statue of man , like that of Memnon , from which proceeded a small sound and pleasant noise , when the rising Sun came by his heat to rarify and force out , by certain small conduits , the air which in the cold of the night was condensed within it . Or haply they might be like those statues of Boetius , whereof Cassiodorus speaking said , Metalla mugiunt , Diomedis in aere grues buccinant , aenus anguis insibilat , aves simulatae fritinniunt , et quae propriam vocem nesciunt , ab aere dulcedinem probantur emittere cantilenae ; for such I doubt not but may be made by the help of that part of Natural Magic which depends on the Mathematics .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 171 ]</span>The Balance of the Dead is an article in almost every creed . Mohammed borrowed it from the Persians . I know not from whence the Monks introduced it ; probably they were ignorant enough to have invented the obvious fiction .</p>
   <p>In the Vision of Thurcillus the ceremony is accurately described . “ At the end of the north wall , within the church , sate St. Paul , and opposite him , without , was the Devil and his Angels . At the feet of the Devil a burning pit flamed up , which was the mouth of the Pit of Hell . A Balance equally poised , was fixed upon the wall between the Devil and the Apostle , one scale hanging before each . The Apostle had two weights , a greater and a less , all shining and like gold , and the Devil also had two smoky and black ones . Therefore the Souls that were all black came one after another , with great fear and trembling , to behold the weighing of their good and evil works : for these weights weighed the works of all the souls , according to the good or evil which they had done . When the scale inclined to the Apostle , he took the Soul , and introduced it thro ’ the Eastern gate , into the fire of Purgatory , that there it might expiate its crimes . But when the scale inclined and sunk towards the Devil , then he and his Angels snatched the soul miserably howling and cursing the father and mother that begot it to eternal torments , and cast it with laughter and grinning into the deep and fiery pit which was at the feet of the Devil . Of this Balance of good and evil much may be found in the writings of the holy Fathers . ”</p>
   <p>Matthew Paris .</p>
   <p>“ Concerning the salvation of Charlemagne , Archbishop Turpin , a man of holy life , wrote thus . “ I , Turpin , Archbishop of Rheims , being in my chamber , in the city of Vienna , saying my prayers , saw a legion of Devils in the air , who were making a great noise . I adjured one of them to tell me from whence they came , and wherefore they made so great an uproar . And he replied that they came from Aix la Chapelle , where a great Lord had died , and that they were returning in anger because they had not been able to carry away his soul . I asked him who the great Lord was , and why they had not been able to carry away his soul . He replied that it was Charlemagne , and that Saint Jago had been greatly against them . And I asked him how St. Jago had been against them ; and he replied , we were weighing the good and the evil which he had done in this world , and Saint Jago brought so much timber and so many stones from the churches which he had founded in his name , that they greatly over-balanced all his evil works ; and so we had no power over his soul . And having said this the Devil disappeared . ”</p>
   <p>We must understand from this vision of Archbishop Turpin , that they who build or repair churches in this world , erect resting places and inns for their salvation .</p>

The classical reader will remember the equivocations of Apollo , the fable of the young man and the Lion in the tapestry will be more generally recollected : we have many buildings in England to which this story has been applied ,— Cook 's Folly near Bristol derives its name from a similar tradition .</p>
   <p>The History of the Buccaneers affords a remarkable instance of prophecy occasioning its own accomplishment .</p>
   <p>“ Before my first going over into the South-Seas with Captain Sharp ( and indeed before any Privateers , at least since Drake and Oxengham ) had gone that way which we afterwards went , except La Sound , a French Captain , who by Capt . Wright 's instructions had ventured as far as Cheapo town with a body of men , but was driven back again , I being then on board Capt . Coxon , in company with three or four more Privateers , about four leagues to the East of Portobel , we took the packets bound thither from Carthagena . We opened a great quantity of the Merchant 's letters , and found the contents of many of them to be very surprizing , the Merchants of several parts of Old-Spain thereby informing their correspondents of Panama , and elsewhere , of a certain prophecy that went about Spain that year , the tenor of which was , that there would be English privateers that year in the West-Indies , who would make such great discoveries , as to open a door into the South-Seas ; which they supposed was fastest shut : and the letters were accordingly full of cautions to their friends to be very watchful and careful of their coasts .</p>
   <p>This door they spake of we all concluded must be the passage over land through the country of the Indians of Darien , who were a little before this become our friends , and had lately fallen out with the Spaniards , breaking off the intercourse which for some time they had with them : And upon calling also to mind the frequent invitations we had from those Indians a little before this time , to pass through their Country , and fall upon the Spaniards in the South-Seas , we from henceforward began to entertain such thoughts in earnest , and soon came to a resolution to make those attempts which we afterwards did with Capt . Sharp , Coxon , &amp; c. So that the taking these letters gave the first life to those bold undertakings : And we took the advantage of the fears the Spaniards were in from that prophecy , or probable conjecture , or whatever it were ; for we sealed up most of the letters again , and sent them ashore to Portobel .</p>

   <p>To this there is an allusion in the Moallakat . “ Then I knew with certainty , that , in so fierce a contest with them , many a heavy blow would make the Perched Birds of the Brain fly quickly from every Skull . ”</p>

   <p>In the Bahar-Danush , Parrots are called the green-vested resemblers of Heaven 's dwellers .

   <p>The disembowelling of the body there , is always performed in great secrecy , and with much religious superstition .

I have frequently held conversations on this subject , with a view to convince them , that all intellectual operations were carried on in the head ; at which they would generally smile , and intimate , that they had frequently seen men recover whose skulls had been fractured , and whose heads had otherways been much injured ; but that , in all cases in which the intestines had been wounded , the persons on a certainty died . Other arguments they would also advance in favour of their belief ; such as the effect of fear , and other passions , which caused great agitation and uneasiness , and would sometimes produce sickness at the stomach , which they attributed intirely to the action of the bowels .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 174 ]</span>When Hosein the son of Ali was sick of a grievous disorder , he longed for a pomegranate , tho ’ that fruit was not then in season . Ali went out , and diligently enquiring found a single one in the possession of a Jew . As he returned with it , a sick man met him and begged half the pomegranate , saying it would restore his health . Ali gave him half , and when he had eaten it , the man requested he would give him the other half , the sooner to complete his recovery . Ali benignantly complied , returned to his son and told him what had happened , and Hosein approved what his father had done .</p>
   <p>Immediately behold a miracle ! as they were talking together the door was gently knocked at . He ordered the woman servant to go there , and she found a man , of all men the most beautiful , who had a plate in his hand covered with green silk , in which were ten pomegranates . The woman was astonished at the beauty of the man and of the pomegranates , and she took one of them and hid it , and carried the other nine to Aly , who kissed the present . When he had counted them he found that one was wanting , and said so to the servant , she confessed that she had taken it on account of its excellence , and Ali gave her her liberty . The Pomegranates were from Paradise , Hosein was cured of his disease only by their odour , and rose up immediately , recovered , and in full strength .</p>
   <p>Maracci .</p>
   <p>I suspect , says Maracci , that this is a true miracle wrought by some Christian Saint , and falsely attributed to Ali . However this may be , it does not appear absurd that God should by some especial favour reward an act of remarkable charity even in an Infidel , as he has sometimes by a striking chastisement punished enormous crimes . But the assertion that the Pomegranates were sent from Paradise , exposes the fable .</p>
   <p>Maracci after detailing and ridiculing the Mohammedan miracles , contrasts with them in an appendix a few of the real and permanent miracles of Christianity which are proved by the testimony of the whole world . He selects five as examples . 1 . The Chapel of Loretto , brought by angels from Nazareth to Illyricum , and from Illyricum to Italy ; faithful messengers having been sent to both places , and finding in both its old foundations , in dimensions and materials , exactly corresponding .</p>
   <p>2 . The cross of St. Thomas in Urbe Malipuritana ( Masulipatan ) in the E. Indies . A Bramin , as the Saint was extended upon his cross in prayer , slew him . On the anniversary of his martyrdom , during the celebration of Mass , the cross gradually becomes luminous , till it shines one white glory . At elevating the host it resumes its natural colour , and sweats blood profusely , in which the faithful dip their clothes , by which many miracles are wrought .</p>
   <p>3 . Certissimum quia evidentissimum — at Barii ( Bari on the Adriatic ) in Apulia a liquor flows from the bones of St. Nicholas , they call it St. Nicholas 's manna , which being preserved in bottles never corrupts or breeds worms — except the possessor be corrupt himself — and daily it works miracles .</p>
   <p>4 . At Tolentinum ( Tolentino in the Marche of Anconia ) the arms of St. Nicholas swell with blood , and pour out copious streams — when any great calamity impends over Christendom .</p>
   <p>5 . The blood of St. Jaunarius at Naples .</p>
   <p>These , says Maracci , are miracula perseverantia , permanent miracles — and it cannot be said as of the Mohammedan ones , that they are tricks of the Devil .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 176 ]</span>Araf is a place between the Paradise and the Hell of the Mohammedans , some deem it a veil of separation , some a strong wall ; others hold it to be a Purgatory in which those believers will remain , whose good and evil works have been so equal that they were neither virtuous enough to enter Paradise , nor guilty enough to be condemned to the fire of Hell . From thence they see the glory of the Blessed , and are near enough to congratulate them ; but their ardent desire to partake the same happiness becomes a great pain . At length at the Day of Judgement , when all men before they are judged , shall be cited to render homage to their Creator , those who are here confined shall prostrate themselves before the face of the Lord , in adoration : and by this act of religion which shall be accounted a merit , the number of their good works will exceed their evil ones , and they will enter into glory .</p>
