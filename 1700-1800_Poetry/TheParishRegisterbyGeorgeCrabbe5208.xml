The year revolves , and I again explore The simple Annals of my Parish poor ; What Infant-members in my flock appear , What Pairs I bless 'd in the departed year ; And who , of Old or Young , or Nymphs or Swains , Are lost to Life , its pleasures and its pains . No Muse I ask , before my view to bring The humble actions of the swains I sing . - How pass 'd the youthful , how the old their days ; Who sank in sloth , and who aspired to praise ; Their tempers , manners , morals , customs , arts , What parts they had , and how they ‘ mploy 'd their parts ; By what elated , soothed , seduced , depress 'd , Full well I know-these Records give the rest . Is there a place , save one the poet sees , A land of love , of liberty , and ease ; Where labour wearies not , nor cares suppress Th ’ eternal flow of rustic happiness ; Where no proud mansion frowns in awful state , Or keeps the sunshine from the cottage-gate ; Where young and old , intent on pleasure , throng , And half man 's life is holiday and song ? Vain search for scenes like these ! no view appears , By sighs unruffled or unstain 'd by tears ; Since vice the world subdued and waters drown 'd , Auburn and Eden can no more be found . Hence good and evil mixed , but man has skill And power to part them , when he feels the will ! Toil , care , and patience bless th ’ abstemious few , Fear , shame , and want the thoughtless herd pursue . Behold the Cot ! where thrives th ’ industrious swain , Source of his pride , his pleasure , and his gain ; Screen 'd from the winter 's wind , the sun 's last ray Smiles on the window and prolongs the day ; Projecting thatch the woodbine 's branches stop , And turn their blossoms to the casement 's top : All need requires is in that cot contain 'd , And much that taste untaught and unrestrain 'd Surveys delighted ; there she loves to trace , In one gay picture , all the royal race ; Around the walls are heroes , lovers , kings ; The print that shows them and the verse that sings . Here the last Louis on his throne is seen , And there he stands imprison 'd , and his Queen ; To these the mother takes her child , and shows What grateful duty to his God he owes ; Who gives to him a happy home , where he Lives and enjoys his freedom with the free ; When kings and queens , dethroned , insulted , tried , Are all these blessings of the poor denied . There is King Charles , and all his Golden Rules , Who proved Misfortune 's was the best of schools : And there his Son , who , tried by years of pain , Proved that misfortunes may be sent in vain . The Magic-mill that grinds the gran'nams young , Close at the side of kind Godiva hung ; She , of her favourite place the pride and joy , Of charms at once most lavish and most coy , By wanton act the purest fame could raise , And give the boldest deed the chastest praise . There stands the stoutest Ox in<country>England</country>fed ; There fights the boldest Jew , Whitechapel bred ; And here Saint Monday 's worthy votaries live , In all the joys that ale and skittles give . Now , lo ! on Egypt 's coast that hostile fleet , By nations dreaded and by NELSON beat ; And here shall soon another triumph come , A deed of glory in a deed of gloom ; Distressing glory ! grievous boon of fate ! The proudest conquest at the dearest rate . On shelf of deal beside the cuckoo-clock , Of cottage reading rests the chosen stock ; Learning we lack , not books , but have a kind For all our wants , a meat for every mind . The tale for wonder and the joke for whim , The half-sung sermon and the half-groan 'd hymn . No need of classing ; each within its place , The feeling finger in the dark can trace ; “ First from the corner , farthest from the wall , ” Such all the rules , and they suffice for all . There pious works for Sunday 's use are found ; Companions for that Bible newly bound ; That Bible , bought by sixpence weekly saved , Has choicest prints by famous hands engraved ; Has choicest notes by many a famous head , Such as to doubt have rustic readers led ; Have made them stop to reason WHY ? and HOW ? And , where they once agreed , to cavil now . Oh ! rather give me commentators plain , Who with no deep researches vex the brain ; Who from the dark and doubtful love to run , And hold their glimmering tapers to the sun ; Who simple truth with nine-fold reasons back , And guard the point no enemies attack . Bunyan 's famed Pilgrim rests that shelf upon ; A genius rare but rude was honest John ; Not one who , early by the Muse beguiled , Drank from her well the waters undefiled ; Not one who slowly gained the hill sublime , Then often sipp 'd and little at a time ; But one who dabbled in the sacred springs , And drank them muddy , mix 'd with baser things . Here to interpret dreams we read the rules , Science our own ! and never taught in schools ; In moles and specks we Fortune 's gifts discern , And Fate 's fix 'd will from Nature 's wanderings learn . Of Hermit Quarll we read , in island rare , Far from mankind and seeming far from care ; Safe from all want , and sound in every limb ; Yes ! there was he , and there was care with him . Unbound and heap 'd , these valued tomes beside , Lay humbler works , the pedlar 's pack supplied ; Yet these , long since , have all acquired a name : The Wandering Jew has found his way to fame ; And fame , denied to many a labour 'd song , Crowns Thumb the Great , and Hickathrift the strong . There too is he , by wizard-power upheld , Jack , by whose arm the giant-brood were quell 'd : His shoes of swiftness on his feet he placed ; His coat of darkness on his loins he braced ; His sword of sharpness in his hand he took , And off the heads of doughty giants stroke : Their glaring eyes beheld no mortal near ; No sound of feet alarm 'd the drowsy ear ; No English blood their Pagan sense could smell , But heads dropt headlong , wondering why they fell . These are the Peasant 's joy , when , placed at ease , Half his delighted offspring mount his knees . To every cot the lord 's indulgent mind Has a small space for garden-ground assign 'd ; Here — till return of morn dismiss 'd the farm -  The careful peasant plies the sinewy arm , Warm 'd as he works , and casts his look around On every foot of that improving ground : It is his own he sees ; his master 's eye Peers not about , some secret fault to spy ; Nor voice severe is there , nor censure known ; -  Hope , profit , pleasure ,— they are all his own . Here grow the humble cives , and , hard by them , The leek with crown globose and reedy stem ; High climb his pulse in many an even row , Deep strike the ponderous roots in soil below ; And herbs of potent smell and pungent taste , Give a warm relish to the night 's repast . Apples and cherries grafted by his hand , And cluster 'd nuts for neighbouring market stand . Nor thus concludes his labour ; near the cot , The reed-fence rises round some fav'rite spot ; Where rich carnations , pinks with purple eyes , Proud hyacinths , the least some florist 's prize , Tulips tall-stemm 'd and pounced auriculas rise . Here on a Sunday-eve , when service ends , Meet and rejoice a family of friends ; All speak aloud , are happy and are free , And glad they seem , and gaily they agree . What , though fastidious ears may shun the speech , Where all are talkers , and where none can teach ; Where still the welcome and the words are old , And the same stories are for ever told ; Yet theirs is joy that , bursting from the heart , Prompts the glad tongue these nothings to impart ; That forms these tones of gladness we despise , That lifts their steps , that sparkles in their eyes ; That talks or laughs or runs or shouts or plays , And speaks in all their looks and all their ways . Fair scenes of peace ! ye might detain us long , But vice and misery now demand the song ; And turn our view from dwellings simply neat , To this infected Row , we term our Street . Here , in cabal , a disputatious crew Each evening meet ; the sot , the cheat , the shrew ; Riots are nightly heard : — the curse , the cries Of beaten wife , perverse in her replies ; While shrieking children hold each threat'ning hand , And sometimes life , and sometimes food demand : Boys , in their first-stol'n rags , to swear begin , And girls , who heed not dress , are skill 'd in gin : Snarers and smugglers here their gains divide ; Ensnaring females here their victims hide ; And here is one , the Sibyl of the Row , Who knows all secrets , or affects to know . Seeking their fate , to her the simple run , To her the guilty , theirs awhile to shun ; Mistress of worthless arts , depraved in will , Her care unblest and unrepaid her skill , Slave to the tribe , to whose command she stoops , And poorer than the poorest maid she dupes . Between the road-way and the walls , offence Invades all eyes and strikes on every sense ; There lie , obscene , at every open door , Heaps from the hearth , and sweepings from the floor , And day by day the mingled masses grow , As sinks are disembogued and kennels flow . There hungry dogs from hungry children steal ; There pigs and chickens quarrel for a meal ; Their dropsied infants wail without redress , And all is want and woe and wretchedness ; Yet should these boys , with bodies bronzed and bare , High-swoln and hard , outlive that lack of care -  Forced on some farm , the unexerted strength , Though loth to action , is compell 'd at length , When warm 'd by health , as serpents in the spring , Aside their slough of indolence they fling . Yet , ere they go , a greater evil comes -  See ! crowded beds in those contiguous rooms ; Beds but ill parted , by a paltry screen Of paper 'd lath , or curtain dropt between ; Daughters and sons to yon compartments creep , And parents here beside their children sleep : Ye who have power , these thoughtless people part , Nor let the ear be first to taint the heart . Come ! search within , nor sight nor smell regard ; The true physician walks the foulest ward . See on the floor , where frousy patches rest ! What nauseous fragments on yon fractured chest ! What downy dust beneath yon window-seat ! And round these posts that serve this bed for feet ; This bed where all those tatter 'd garments lie , Worn by each sex , and now perforce thrown by ! See ! as we gaze , an infant lifts its head , Left by neglect and burrow 'd in that bed ; The Mother-gossip has the love suppress 'd An infant 's cry once waken 'd in her breast ; And daily prattles , as her round she takes ( With strong resentment ) , of the want she makes . Whence all these woes ?— From want of virtuous will , Of honest shame , of time-improving skill ; From want of care t'employ the vacant hour , And want of every kind but want of power . Here are no wheels for either wool or flax , But packs of cards — made up of sundry packs ; Here is no clock , nor will they turn the glass , And see how swift th ’ important moments pass ; Here are no books , but ballads on the wall , Are some abusive , and indecent all ; Pistols are here , unpair 'd ; with nets and hooks , Of every kind , for rivers , ponds , and brooks ; An ample flask , that nightly rovers fill With recent poison from the Dutchman 's still ; A box of tools , with wires of various size , Frocks , wigs , and hats , for night or day disguise , And bludgeons stout to gain or guard a prize . To every house belongs a space of ground , Of equal size , once fenced with paling round ; That paling now by slothful waste destroyed , Dead gorse and stumps of elder fill the void ; Save in the centre-spot , whose walls of clay Hide sots and striplings at their drink or play : Within , a board , beneath a tiled retreat , Allures the bubble and maintains the cheat ; Where heavy ale in spots like varnish shows , Where chalky tallies yet remain in rows ; Black pipes and broken jugs the seats defile , The walls and windows , rhymes and reck'nings vile ; Prints of the meanest kind disgrace the door , And cards , in curses torn , lie fragments on the floor . Here his poor bird th ’ inhuman Cocker brings , Arms his hard heel and clips his golden wings ; With spicy food th ’ impatient spirit feeds , And shouts and curses as the battle bleeds . Struck through the brain , deprived of both his eyes , The vanquished bird must combat till he dies ; Must faintly peck at his victorious foe , And reel and stagger at each feeble blow : When fallen , the savage grasps his dabbled plumes , His blood-stain 'd arms , for other deaths assumes ; And damns the craven-fowl , that lost his stake , And only bled and perished for his sake . Such are our Peasants , those to whom we yield Praise with relief , the fathers of the field ; And these who take from our reluctant hands What Burn advises or the Bench commands . Our Farmers round , well pleased with constant gain , Like other farmers , flourish and complain . - These are our groups ; our Portraits next appear , And close our Exhibition for the year . WITH evil omen we that year begin : A Child of Shame ,— stern Justice adds , of Sin , Is first recorded ;— I would hide the deed , But vain the wish ; I sigh , and I proceed : And could I well th'instructive truth convey , ‘ Twould warn the giddy and awake the gay . Of all the nymphs who gave our village grace , The Miller 's daughter had the fairest face : Proud was the Miller ; money was his pride ; He rode to market , as our farmers ride , And ‘ twas his boast , inspired by spirits , there , His favourite Lucy should be rich as fair ; But she must meek and still obedient prove , And not presume , without his leave , to love . A youthful Sailor heard him ;— “ Ha ! ” quoth he , “ This Miller 's maiden is a prize for me ; Her charms I love , his riches I desire , And all his threats but fan the kindling fire ; My ebbing purse no more the foe shall fill , But Love 's kind act and Lucy at the mill . ” Thus thought the youth , and soon the chase began , Stretch 'd all his sail , nor thought of pause or plan : His trusty staff in his bold hand he took , Like him and like his frigate , heart of oak ; Fresh were his features , his attire was new ; Clean was his linen , and his jacket blue : Of finest jean his trousers , tight and trim , Brush 'd the large buckle at the silver rim . He soon arrived , he traced the village-green , There saw the maid , and was with pleasure seen ; Then talk 'd of love , till Lucy 's yielding heart Confess 'd ‘ twas painful , though ‘ twas right to part . “ For ah ! my father has a haughty soul ; Whom best he loves , he loves but to control ; Me to some churl in bargain he 'll consign , And make some tyrant of the parish mine : Cold is his heart , and he with looks severe Has often forced but never shed the tear ; Save , when my mother died , some drops expressed A kind of sorrow for a wife at rest : -  To me a master 's stern regard is shown , I 'm like his steed , prized highly as his own ; Stroked but corrected , threatened when supplied , His slave and boast , his victim and his pride . ” “ Cheer up , my lass ! I 'll to thy father go , The Miller cannot be the Sailor 's foe ; Both live by Heaven 's free gale , that plays aloud In the stretch 'd canvass and the piping shroud ; The rush of winds , the flapping sails above , And rattling planks within , are sounds we love ; Calms are our dread ; when tempests plough the deep , We take a reef , and to the rocking sleep . ” “ Ha ! ” quoth the Miller , moved at speech so rash , “ Art thou like me ? then where thy notes and cash ? Away to Wapping , and a wife command , With all thy wealth , a guinea in thine hand ; There with thy messmates quaff the muddy cheer , And leave my Lucy for thy betters here . ” “ Revenge ! revenge ! ” the angry lover cried , Then sought the nymph , and “ Be thou now my bride . ” Bride had she been , but they no priest could move To bind in law the couple bound by love . What sought these lovers then by day by night ? But stolen moments of disturb 'd delight ; Soft trembling tumults , terrors dearly prized , Transports that pain 'd , and joys that agonised ; Till the fond damsel , pleased with lad so trim , Awed by her parent , and enticed by him , Her lovely form from savage power to save , Gave — not her hand — but ALL she could she gave . Then came the day of shame , the grievous night , The varying look , the wandering appetite ; The joy assumed , while sorrow dimm 'd the eyes , The forced sad smiles that follow 'd sudden sighs ; And every art , long used , but used in vain , To hide thy progress , Nature , and thy pain . Too eager caution shows some danger 's near , The bully 's bluster proves the coward 's fear ; His sober step the drunkard vainly tries , And nymphs expose the failings they disguise . First , whispering gossips were in parties seen , Then louder Scandal walk 'd the village — green ; Next babbling Folly told the growing ill , And busy Malice dropp 'd it at the mill . “ Go ! to thy curse and mine , ” the Father said , “ Strife and confusion stalk around thy bed ; Want and a wailing brat thy portion be , Plague to thy fondness , as thy fault to me ; -  Where skulks the villain ? ” - “ On the ocean wide My William seeks a portion for his bride . ” - “ Vain be his search ; but , till the traitor come , The higgler 's cottage be thy future home ; There with his ancient shrew and care abide , And hide thy head ,— thy shame thou canst not hide . ” Day after day was pass 'd in pains and grief ; Week follow 'd week ,— and still was no relief : Her boy was born — no lads nor lasses came To grace the rite or give the child a name ; Nor grave conceited nurse , of office proud , Bore the young Christian roaring through the crowd : In a small chamber was my office done , Where blinks through paper 'd panes the setting sun ; Where noisy sparrows , perch 'd on penthouse near , Chirp tuneless joy , and mock the frequent tear ; Bats on their webby wings in darkness move , And feebly shriek their melancholy love . No Sailor came ; the months in terror fled ! Then news arrived — He fought , and he was DEAD ! At the lone cottage Lucy lives , and still Walks for her weekly pittance to the mill ; A mean seraglio there her father keeps , Whose mirth insults her , as she stands and weeps ; And sees the plenty , while compell 'd to stay , Her father 's pride , become his harlot 's prey . Throughout the lanes she glides , at evening 's close , And softly lulls her infant to repose ; Then sits and gazes , but with viewless look , As gilds the moon the rippling of the brook ; And sings her vespers , but in voice so low , She hears their murmurs as the waters flow : And she too murmurs , and begins to find The solemn wanderings of a wounded mind . Visions of terror , views of woe succeed , The mind 's impatience , to the body 's need ; By turns to that , by turns to this a prey , She knows what reason yields , and dreads what madness may . Next , with their boy , a decent couple came , And call 'd him Robert , ‘ twas his father 's name ; Three girls preceded , all by time endear 'd , And future births were neither hoped nor fear 'd : Blest in each other , but to no excess , Health , quiet , comfort , form 'd their happiness ; Love all made up of torture and delight , Was but mere madness in this couple 's sight : Susan could think , though not without a sigh , If she were gone , who should her place supply ; And Robert , half in earnest , half in jest , Talk of her spouse when he should be at rest : Yet strange would either think it to be told , Their love was cooling or their hearts were cold . Few were their acres ,— but , with these content , They were , each pay-day , ready with their rent : And few their wishes — what their farm denied , The neighbouring town , at trifling cost , supplied . If at the draper 's window Susan cast A longing look , as with her goods she pass 'd , And , with the produce of the wheel and churn , Bought her a Sunday — robe on her return ; True to her maxim , she would take no rest , Till care repaid that portion to the chest : Or if , when loitering at the Whitsun-fair , Her Robert spent some idle shillings there ; Up at the barn , before the break of day , He made his labour for th ’ indulgence pay : Thus both — that waste itself might work in vain -  Wrought double tides , and all was well again . Yet , though so prudent , there were times of joy , ( The day they wed , the christening of the boy . ) When to the wealthier farmers there was shown Welcome unfeign 'd , and plenty like their own ; For Susan served the great , and had some pride Among our topmost people to preside : Yet in that plenty , in that welcome free , There was the guiding nice frugality , That , in the festal as the frugal day , Has , in a different mode , a sovereign sway ; As tides the same attractive influence know , In the least ebb and in their proudest flow ; The wise frugality , that does not give A life to saving , but that saves to live ; Sparing , not pinching , mindful though not mean , O'er all presiding , yet in nothing seen . Recorded next a babe of love I trace ! Of many loves , the mother 's fresh disgrace . - “ Again , thou harlot ! could not all thy pain , All my reproof , thy wanton thoughts restrain ? ” “ Alas ! your reverence , wanton thoughts , I grant , Were once my motive , now the thoughts of want ; Women , like me , as ducks in a decoy , Swim down a stream , and seem to swim in joy . Your sex pursue us , and our own disdain ; Return is dreadful , and escape is vain . Would men forsake us , and would women strive To help the fall'n , their virtue might revive . ” For rite of churching soon she made her way , In dread of scandal , should she miss the day : -  Two matrons came ! with them she humbly knelt , Their action copied and their comforts felt , From that great pain and peril to be free , Though still in peril of that pain to be ; Alas ! what numbers , like this amorous dame , Are quick to censure , but are dead to shame ! Twin-infants then appear ; a girl , a boy , Th ’ overflowing cup of Gerard Ablett 's joy : One had I named in every year that passed Since Gerard wed ! and twins behold at last ! Well pleased , the bridegroom smiled to hear — “ A vine Fruitful and spreading round the walls be thine , And branch-like be thine offspring ! ” — Gerard then Look 'd joyful love , and softly said “ Amen . ” Now of that vine he 'd have no more increase , Those playful branches now disturb his peace : Them he beholds around his tables spread , But finds , the more the branch , the less the bread ; And while they run his humble walls about , They keep the sunshine of good humour out . Cease , man , to grieve ! thy master 's lot survey , Whom wife and children , thou and thine obey ; A farmer proud , beyond a farmer 's pride , Of all around the envy or the guide ; Who trots to market on a steed so fine , That when I meet him , I 'm ashamed of mine ; Whose board is high upheaved with generous fare , Which five stout sons and three tall daughters share . Cease , man , to grieve , and listen to his care . A few years fled , and all thy boys shall be Lords of a cot , and labourers like thee : Thy girls unportion 'd neighb'ring youths shall lead Brides from my church , and thenceforth thou art freed : But then thy master shall of cares complain , Care after care , a long connected train ; His sons for farms shall ask a large supply , For farmers ’ sons each gentle miss shall sigh ; Thy mistress , reasoning well of life 's decay , Shall ask a chaise , and hardly brook delay ; The smart young cornet , who with so much grace Rode in the ranks and betted at the race , While the vex 'd parent rails at deed so rash , Shall d ** n his luck , and stretch his hand for cash . Sad troubles , Gerard ! now pertain to thee , When thy rich master seems from trouble free ; But ‘ tis one fate at different times assign 'd , And thou shalt lose the cares that he must find . “ Ah ! ” quoth our village Grocer , rich and old , “ Would I might one such cause for care behold ! ” To whom his Friend , “ Mine greater bliss would be , Would Heav'n take those my spouse assigns to me . ” Aged were both , that Dawkins , Ditchem this , Who much of marriage thought , and much amiss ; Both would delay , the one , till — riches gain 'd , The son he wish 'd might be to honour train 'd ; His Friend — lest fierce intruding heirs should come , To waste his hoard and vex his quiet home . Dawkins , a dealer once , on burthen 'd back Bore his whole substance in a pedlar 's pack ; To dames discreet , the duties yet unpaid , His stores of lace and hyson he convey 'd : When thus enriched , he chose at home to stop , And fleece his neighbours in a new-built shop ; Then woo 'd a spinster blithe , and hoped , when wed , For love 's fair favours and a fruitful bed . Not so his Friend ;— on widow fair and staid He fix 'd his eye , but he was much afraid ; Yet woo 'd ; while she his hair of silver hue Demurely noticed , and her eye withdrew : Doubtful he paused — “ Ah ! were I sure , ” he cried , No craving children would my gains divide ; Fair as she is , I would my widow take , And live more largely for my partner 's sake . ” With such their views some thoughtful years they pass 'd , And hoping , dreading , they were bound at last . And what their fate ? Observe them as they go , Comparing fear with fear and woe with woe . “ Humphrey ! ” said Dawkins , “ envy in my breast Sickens to see thee in thy children blest : They are thy joys , while I go grieving home To a sad spouse , and our eternal gloom : We look despondency ; no infant near , To bless the eye or win the parent 's ear ; Our sudden heats and quarrels to allay , And soothe the petty sufferings of the day : Alike our want , yet both the want reprove ; Where are , I cry , these pledges of our love ? When she , like Jacob 's wife , makes fierce reply , Yet fond — Oh ! give me children , or I die : And I return — still childless doom 'd to live , Like the vex 'd patriarch — Are they mine to give ? Ah ! much I envy thee thy boys , who ride On poplar branch , and canter at thy side ; And girls , whose cheeks thy chin 's fierce fondness know , And with fresh beauty at the contact glow . ” “ Oh ! simple friend , ” said Ditchem , “ wouldst thou gain A father 's pleasure by a husband 's pain ? Alas ! what pleasure — when some vig'rous boy Should swell thy pride , some rosy girl thy joy ; Is it to doubt who grafted this sweet flower , Or whence arose that spirit and that power ? “ Four years I 've wed ; not one has passed in vain ; Behold the fifth ! behold a babe again ! My wife 's gay friends th ’ unwelcome imp admire , And fill the room with gratulation dire : While I in silence sate , revolving all That influence ancient men , or that befall ; A gay pert guest — Heav'n knows his business — came ; A glorious boy ! he cried , and what the name ? Angry I growl 'd ,— My spirit cease to tease , Name it yourselves ,— Cain , Judas , if you please ; His father 's give him ,— should you that explore , The devil 's or yours : — I said , and sought the door . My tender partner not a word or sigh Gives to my wrath , nor to my speech reply ; But takes her comforts , triumphs in my pain , And looks undaunted for a birth again . ” Heirs thus denied afflict the pining heart , And thus afforded , jealous pangs impart ; Let , therefore , none avoid , and none demand These arrows number 'd for the giant 's hand . Then with their infants three , the parents came , And each assign 'd — ‘ twas all they had — a name ; Names of no mark or price ; of them not one Shall court our view on the sepulchral stone , Or stop the clerk , th ’ engraven scrolls to spell , Or keep the sexton from the sermon bell . An orphan-girl succeeds : ere she was born Her father died , her mother on that morn : The pious mistress of the school sustains Her parents ’ part , nor their affection feigns , But pitying feels : with due respect and joy , I trace the matron at her loved employ ; What time the striplings , wearied e'en with play , Part at the closing of the summer 's day , And each by different path returns the well-known way Then I behold her at her cottage-door , Frugal of light ;— her Bible laid before , When on her double duty she proceeds , Of time as frugal — knitting as she reads : Her idle neighbours , who approach to tell Some trifling tale , her serious looks compel To hear reluctant ,— while the lads who pass , In pure respect , walk silent on the grass : Then sinks the day , but not to rest she goes , Till solemn prayers the daily duties close . But I digress , and lo ! an infant train Appear , and call me to my task again . “ Why Lonicera wilt thou name thy child ? ” I ask the Gardener 's wife , in accents mild : “ We have a right , ” replied the sturdy dame ; -  And Lonicera was the infant 's name . If next a son shall yield our Gardener joy , Then Hyacinthus shall be that fair boy ; And if a girl , they will at length agree That Belladonna that fair maid shall be . High-sounding words our worthy Gardener gets , And at his club to wondering swains repeats ; He then of Rhus and Rhododendron speaks , And Allium calls his onions and his leeks ; Nor weeds are now , for whence arose the weed , Scarce plants , fair herbs , and curious flowers proceed , Where Cuckoo-pints and Dandelions sprung ( Gross names had they our plainer sires among ) , There Arums , there Leontodons we view , And Artemisia grows where wormwood grew . But though no weed exists his garden round , From Rumex strong our Gardener frees his ground , Takes soft Senecio from the yielding land , And grasps the arm 'd Urtica in his hand . Not Darwin 's self had more delight to sing Of floral courtship , in th ’ awaken 'd Spring , Than Peter Pratt , who simpering loves to tell How rise the Stamens , as the Pistils swell ; How bend and curl the moist-top to the spouse , And give and take the vegetable vows ; How those esteem 'd of old but tips and chives , Are tender husbands and obedient wives ; Who live and love within the sacred bower , -  That bridal bed , the vulgar term a flower . Hear Peter proudly , to some humble friend , A wondrous secret , in his science , lend : -  “ Would you advance the nuptial hour and bring The fruit of Autumn with the flowers of Spring ; View that light frame where Cucumis lies spread , And trace the husbands in their golden bed , Three powder 'd Anthers ;— then no more delay , But to the stigma 's tip their dust convey ; Then by thyself , from prying glance secure , Twirl the full tip and make your purpose sure ; A long-abiding race the deed shall pay , Nor one unblest abortion pine away . ” T'admire their Mend 's discourse our swains agree , And call it science and philosophy . “ ‘ Tis good , ‘ tis pleasant , through th ’ advancing year , To see unnumbered growing forms appear ; What leafy-life from Earth 's broad bosom rise ! What insect myriads seek the summer skies ! What scaly tribes in every streamlet move ; What plumy people sing in every grove ! All with the year awaked to life , delight , and love . Then names are good ; for how , without their aid , Is knowledge , gain 'd by man , to man convey 'd ? But from that source shall all our pleasures flow ? Shall all our knowledge be those names to know ? Then he , with memory blest , shall bear away The palm from Grew , and Middleton , and Ray : No ! let us rather seek , in grove and field , What food for wonder , what for use they yield ; Some just remark from Nature 's people bring , And some new source of homage for her King . Pride lives with all ; strange names our rustics give To helpless infants , that their own may live ; Pleased to be known , they 'll some attention claim , And find some by-way to the house of fame . The straightest furrow lifts the ploughman 's art , The hat he gained has warmth for head and heart ; The bowl that beats the greater number down Of tottering nine-pins , gives to fame the clown ; Or , foil 'd in these , he opes his ample jaws , And lets a frog leap down , to gain applause ; Or grins for hours , or tipples for a week , Or challenges a well-pinch 'd pig to squeak : Some idle deed , some child 's preposterous name , Shall make him known , and give his folly fame . To name an infant meet our village sires , Assembled all as such event requires ; Frequent and full , the rural sages sate , And speakers many urged the long debate , -  Some harden 'd knaves , who roved the country round , Had left a babe within the parish bound . - First , of the fact they question 'd — “ Was it true ? ” The child was brought — “ What then remained to do ? ” “ Was't dead or living ? ” This was fairly proved , -  ‘ Twas pinched , it roar 'd , and every doubt removed . Then by what name th ’ unwelcome guest to call Was long a question , and it posed them all ; For he who lent it to a babe unknown , Censorious men might take it for his own : They look 'd about , they gravely spoke to all , And not one Richard answer 'd to the call . Next they inquired the day , when , passing by , Th ’ unlucky peasant heard the stranger 's cry : This known ,— how food and raiment they might give Was next debated — for the rogue would live ; At last , with all their words and work content , Back to their homes the prudent vestry went , And Richard Monday to the workhouse sent . There was he pinched and pitied , thump 'd and fed , And duly took his beatings and his bread ; Patient in all control , in all abuse , He found contempt and kicking have their use : Sad , silent , supple ; bending to the blow , A slave of slaves , the lowest of the low ; His pliant soul gave way to all things base , He knew no shame , he dreaded no disgrace . It seem 'd , so well his passions he suppress 'd , No feeling stirr 'd his ever-torpid breast ; Him might the meanest pauper bruise and cheat , He was a footstool for the beggar 's feet ; His were the legs that ran at all commands ; They used on all occasions Richard 's hands : His very soul was not his own ; he stole As others order 'd , and without a dole ; In all disputes , on either part he lied , And freely pledged his oath on either side ; In all rebellions Richard joined the rest , In all detections Richard first confess 'd ; Yet , though disgraced , he watched his time so well , He rose in favour when in fame he fell ; Base was his usage , vile his whole employ , And all despised and fed the pliant boy . At length “ ‘ Tis time he should abroad be sent , ” Was whispered near him ,— and abroad he went ; One morn they call 'd him , Richard answer 'd not ; They deem 'd him hanging , and in time forgot , -  Yet miss 'd him long , as each throughout the clan Found he “ had better spared a better man . ” Now Richard 's talents for the world were fit , He 'd no small cunning , and had some small wit ; Had that calm look which seem 'd to all assent , And that complacent speech which nothing meant : He 'd but one care , and that he strove to hide -  How best for Richard Monday to provide . Steel , through opposing plates , the magnet draws , And steely atoms culls from dust and straws ; And thus our hero , to his interest true , Gold through all bars and from each trifle drew ; But still more surely round the world to go , This fortune 's child had neither friend nor foe . Long lost to us , at last our man we trace , -  “ Sir Richard Monday died at Monday Place : ” His lady 's worth , his daughter 's , we peruse , And find his grandsons all as rich as Jews : He gave reforming charities a sum , And bought the blessings of the blind and dumb ; Bequeathed to missions money from the stocks , And Bibles issued from his private box ; But to his native place severely just , He left a pittance bound in rigid trust ; -  Two paltry pounds , on every quarter'shYpppHeNday , ( At church produced ) for forty loaves should pay ; A stinted gift that to the parish shows He kept in mind their bounty and their blows ! To farmers three , the year has given a son , Finch on the Moor , and French , and Middleton . Twice in this year a female Giles I see , A Spalding once , and once a Barnaby : -  A humble man is HE , and when they meet , Our farmers find him on a distant seat ; There for their wit he serves a constant theme , -  “ They praise his dairy , they extol his team , They ask the price of each unrivall 'd steed , And whence his sheep , that admirable breed . His thriving arts they beg he would explain , And where he puts the money he must gain . They have their daughters , but they fear their friend Would think his sons too much would condescend : -  They have their sons who would their fortunes try , But fear his daughters will their suit deny . ” So runs the joke , while James , with sigh profound , And face of care , looks moveless on the ground ; His cares , his sighs , provoke the insult more , And point the jest — for Barnaby is poor . Last in my list , five untaught lads appear ; Their father dead , compassion sent them here , -  For still that rustic infidel denied To have their names with solemn rite applied : His , a lone house , by Deadman 's Dyke-way stood ; And his a nightly haunt , in Lonely-wood : Each village inn has heard the ruffian boast , That he believed “ in neither God nor ghost ; That when the sod upon the sinner press 'd , He , like the saint , had everlasting rest ; That never priest believed his doctrines true , But would , for profit , own himself a Jew , Or worship wood and stone , as honest heathen do ; That fools alone on future worlds rely , And all who die for faith deserve to die . ” These maxims ,— part th ’ Attorney 's Clerk profess 'd , His own transcendent genius found the rest . Our pious matrons heard , and , much amazed , Gazed on the man , and trembled as they gazed ; And now his face explored , and now his feet , Man 's dreaded foe in this bad man to meet : But him our drunkards as their champion raised , Their bishop call 'd , and as their hero praised : Though most , when sober , and the rest , when sick , Had little question whence his bishopric . But he , triumphant spirit ! all things dared ; He poach 'd the wood , and on the warren snared ; ‘ Twas his , at cards , each novice to trepan , And call the want of rogues “ the rights of man ; ” Wild as the winds he let his offspring rove , And deem 'd the marriage-bond the bane of love . What age and sickness , for a man so bold , Had done , we know not ;— none beheld him old ; By night , as business urged , he sought the wood ; -  The ditch was deep ,— the rain had caused a flood , -  The foot-bridge fail 'd ,— he plunged beneath the deep , And slept , if truth were his , th'eternal sleep . These have we named ; on life 's rough sea they sail , With many a prosperous , many an adverse gale ! Where passion soon , like powerful winds , will rage , And prudence , wearied , with their strength engage : Then each , in aid , shall some companion ask , For help or comfort in the tedious task ; And what that help — what joys from union flow , What good or ill , we next prepare to show ; And row , meantime , our weary bark to shore , As Spenser his — but not with Spenser 's oar . { 2 } PART II .</docImprint>

DISPOSED to wed , e'en while you hasten , stay ; There 's great advantage in a small delay : Thus Ovid sang , and much the wise approve This prudent maxim of the priest of Love ; If poor , delay for future want prepares , And eases humble life of half its cares ; If rich , delay shall brace the thoughtful mind , T'endure the ills that e'en the happiest find : Delay shall knowledge yield on either part , And show the value of the vanquish 'd heart ; The humours , passions , merits , failings prove , And gently raise the veil that 's worn by Love ; Love , that impatient guide !— too proud to think Of vulgar wants , of clothing , meat , and drink , Urges our amorous swains their joys to seize , And then , at rags and hunger frighten 'd , flees : Yet not too long in cold debate remain ; Till age refrain not — but if old , refrain . By no such rule would Gaffer Kirk be tried ; First in the year he led a blooming bride , And stood a wither 'd elder at her side . Oh ! Nathan ! Nathan ! at thy years trepann 'd , To take a wanton harlot by the hand ! Thou , who wert used so tartly to express Thy sense of matrimonial happiness , Till every youth , whose banns at church were read , Strove not to meet , or meeting , hung his head ; And every lass forebore at thee to look , A sly old fish , too cunning for the hook ; And now at sixty , that pert dame to see , Of all thy savings mistress , and of thee ; Now will the lads , rememb'ring insults past , Cry , “ What , the wise one in the trap at last ! ” Fie ! Nathan ! fie ! to let an artful jade The close recesses of thine heart invade ; What grievous pangs ! what suffering she 'll impart ! And fill with anguish that rebellious heart ; For thou wilt strive incessantly , in vain , By threatening speech thy freedom to regain : But she for conquest married , nor will prove A dupe to thee , thine anger or thy love ; Clamorous her tongue will be : — of either sex , She 'll gather friends around thee and perplex Thy doubtful soul ;— thy money she will waste In the vain ramblings of a vulgar taste ; And will be happy to exert her power , In every eye , in thine , at every hour . Then wilt thou bluster — “ No ! I will not rest , And see consumed each shilling of my chest : ” Thou wilt be valiant — “ When thy cousins call , I will abuse and shut my door on all : ” Thou wilt be cruel !— “ What the law allows , That be thy portion , my ungrateful spouse ! Nor other shillings shalt thou then receive ; And when I die — What ! may I this believe ? Are these true tender tears ? and does my Kitty grieve ? Ah ! crafty vixen , thine old man has fears ; But weep no more ! I 'm melted by thy tears ; Spare but my money ; thou shalt rule ME still , And see thy cousins : — there ! I burn the will . ” Thus , with example sad , our year began , A wanton vixen and a weary man ; But had this tale in other guise been told , Young let the lover be , the lady old , And that disparity of years shall prove No bane of peace , although some bar to love : ‘ Tis not the worst , our nuptial ties among , That joins the ancient bride and bridegroom young ; -  Young wives , like changing winds , their power display By shifting points and varying day by day ; Now zephyrs mild , now whirlwinds in their force , They sometimes speed , but often thwart our course ; And much experienced should that pilot be , Who sails with them on life 's tempestuous sea . But like a trade-wind is the ancient dame , Mild to your wish and every day the same ; Steady as time , no sudden squalls you fear , But set full sail and with assurance steer ; Till every danger in your way be past , And then she gently , mildly breathes her last ; Rich you arrive , in port awhile remain , And for a second venture sail again . For this , blithe Donald southward made his way , And left the lasses on the banks of Tay ; Him to a neighbouring garden fortune sent , Whom we beheld , aspiringly content : Patient and mild he sought the dame to please , Who ruled the kitchen and who bore the keys . Fair Lucy first , the laundry 's grace and pride , With smiles and gracious looks , her fortune tried ; But all in vain she praised his “ pawky eyne , ” Where never fondness was for Lucy seen : Him the mild Susan , boast of dairies , loved , And found him civil , cautious , and unmoved : From many a fragrant simple , Catherine 's skill Drew oil and essence from the boiling still ; But not her warmth , nor all her winning ways , From his cool phlegm could Donald 's spirit raise : Of beauty heedless , with the merry mute , To Mistress Dobson he preferr 'd his suit ; There proved his service , there address 'd his vows , And saw her mistress ,— friend ,— protectress ,— spouse ; A butler now , he thanks his powerful bride , And , like her keys , keeps constant at her side . Next at our altar stood a luckless pair , Brought by strong passions and a warrant there ; By long rent cloak , hung loosely , strove the bride , From every eye , what all perceived , to hide , While the boy-bridegroom , shuffling in his pace , Now hid awhile and then exposed his face ; As shame alternately with anger strove , The brain confused with muddy ale , to move In haste and stammering he perform 'd his part , And look 'd the rage that rankled in his heart ; ( So will each lover inly curse his fate , Too soon made happy and made wise too late :) I saw his features take a savage gloom , And deeply threaten for the days to come . Low spake the lass , and lisp 'd and minced the while , Look 'd on the lad , and faintly tried to smile ; With soften 'd speech and humbled tone she strove To stir the embers of departed love : While he , a tyrant , frowning walk 'd before , Felt the poor purse , and sought the public door , She sadly following , in submission went , And saw the final shilling foully spent ; Then to her father 's hut the pair withdrew , And bade to love and comfort long adieu ! Ah ! fly temptation , youth , refrain ! refrain ! I preach for ever ; but I preach in vain ! Two summers since , I saw at Lammas Fair The sweetest flower that ever blossom 'd there , When Phoebe Dawson gaily cross 'd the Green , In haste to see , and happy to be seen : Her air , her manners , all who saw admired ; Courteous though coy , and gentle though retired ; The joy of youth and health her eyes display 'd , And ease of heart her every look convey 'd ; A native skill her simple robes express 'd , As with untutor 'd elegance she dress 'd ; The lads around admired so fair a sight , And Phoebe felt , and felt she gave , delight . Admirers soon of every age she gain 'd , Her beauty won them and her worth retain 'd ; Envy itself could no contempt display , They wish 'd her well , whom yet they wish 'd away . Correct in thought , she judged a servant 's place Preserved a rustic beauty from disgrace ; But yet on Sunday-eve , in freedom 's hour , With secret joy she felt that beauty 's power , When some proud bliss upon the heart would steal , That , poor or rich , a beauty still must feel . At length the youth ordain 'd to move her breast , Before the swains with bolder spirit press 'd ; With looks less timid made his passion known , And pleased by manners most unlike her own ; Loud though in love , and confident though young ; Fierce in his air , and voluble of tongue ; By trade a tailor , though , in scorn of trade , He served the ‘ Squire , and brush 'd the coat he made . Yet now , would Phoebe her consent afford , Her slave alone , again he 'd mount the board ; With her should years of growing love be spent , And growing wealth ;— she sigh 'd and look 'd consent . Now , through the lane , up hill , and ‘ cross the green : ( Seen by but few , and blushing to be seen -  Dejected , thoughtful , anxious , and afraid ,) Led by the lover , walk 'd the silent maid ; Slow through the meadows roved they , many a mile , Toy 'd by each bank , and trifled at each stile ; Where , as he painted every blissful view , And highly colour 'd what he strongly drew , The pensive damsel , prone to tender fears , Dimm 'd the false prospect with prophetic tears. -  Thus pass 'd th ’ allotted hours , till lingering late , The lover loiter 'd at the master 's gate ; There he pronounced adieu ! and yet would stay , Till chidden — soothed — entreated — forced away ; He would of coldness , though indulged , complain , And oft retire , and oft return again ; When , if his teasing vex 'd her gentle mind , The grief assumed compell 'd her to be kind ! For he would proof of plighted kindness crave , That she resented first , and then forgave ; And to his grief and penance yielded more Than his presumption had required before . Ah ! fly temptation , youth ; refrain ! refrain ! Each yielding maid and each presuming swain ! Lo ! now with red rent cloak and bonnet black , And torn green gown loose hanging at her back , One who an infant in her arms sustains , And seems in patience striving with her pains ; Pinch 'd are her looks , as one who pines for bread , Whose cares are growing — and whose hopes are fled ; Pale her parch 'd lips , her heavy eyes sunk low , And tears unnoticed from their channels flow ; Serene her manner , till some sudden pain Frets the meek soul , and then she 's calm again ; -  Her broken pitcher to the pool she takes , And every step with cautious terror makes ; For not alone that infant in her arms , But nearer cause , her anxious soul alarms . With water burthen 'd , then she picks her way , Slowly and cautious , in the clinging clay ; Till , in mid-green , she trusts a place unsound , And deeply plunges in th ’ adhesive ground ; Thence , but with pain , her slender foot she takes , While hope the mind as strength the frame forsakes ; For when so full the cup of sorrow grows , Add but a drop , it instantly o'erflows . And now her path , but not her peace , she gains , Safe from her task , but shivering with her pains ; Her home she reaches , open leaves the door , And placing first her infant on the floor , She bares her bosom to the wind , and sits , And sobbing struggles with the rising fits : In vain they come , she feels the inflating grief , That shuts the swelling bosom from relief ; That speaks in feeble cries a soul distress 'd , Or the sad laugh that cannot be repress 'd . The neighbour-matron leaves her wheel and flies With all the aid her poverty supplies ; Unfee 'd , the calls of Nature she obeys , Not led by profit , not allur 'd by praise , And waiting long , till these contentions cease , She speaks of comfort , and departs in peace . Friend of distress ! the mourner feels thy aid ; She cannot pay thee , but thou wilt be paid . But who this child of weakness , want , and care ? ‘ Tis Phoebe Dawson , pride of Lammas Fair ; Who took her lover for his sparkling eyes , Expressions warm , and love-inspiring lies : Compassion first assail 'd her gentle heart , For all his suffering , all his bosom 's smart : “ And then his prayers ! they would a savage move , And win the coldest of the sex to love : ” -  But ah ! too soon his looks success declared , Too late her loss the marriage-rite repair 'd ; The faithless flatterer then his vows forgot , A captious tyrant or a noisy sot : If present , railing , till he saw her pain 'd ; If absent , spending what their labours gain 'd ; Till that fair form in want and sickness pined , And hope and comfort fled that gentle mind . Then fly temptation , youth ; resist , refrain ! Nor let me preach for ever and in vain ! Next came a well-dress 'd pair , who left their coach , And made , in long procession , slow approach ; For this gay bride had many a female friend , And youths were there , this favour 'd youth t'attend : Silent , nor wanting due respect , the crowd Stood humbly round , and gratulation bow 'd ; But not that silent crowd , in wonder fix 'd , Not numerous friends , who praise and envy mix 'd , Nor nymphs attending near to swell the pride Of one more fair , the ever-smiling bride ; Nor that gay bride , adorn 'd with every grace , Nor love nor joy triumphant in her face , Could from the youth 's sad signs of sorrow chase : Why didst thou grieve ? wealth , pleasure , freedom thine ; Vex 'd it thy soul , that freedom to resign ? Spake Scandal truth ? “ Thou didst not then intend So soon to bring thy wooing to an end ? ” Or , was it , as our prating rustics say , To end as soon , but in a different way ? ‘ Tis told thy Phillis is a skilful dame , Who play 'd uninjured with the dangerous flame ; That , while , like Lovelace , thou thy coat display 'd , And hid the snare for her affection laid , Thee , with her net , she found the means to catch , And at the amorous see-saw won the match : Yet others tell , the Captain fix 'd thy doubt ; He 'd call thee brother , or he 'd call thee out : -  But rest the motive — all retreat too late , Joy like thy bride 's should on thy brow have sate ; The deed had then appear 'd thine own intent , A glorious day , by gracious fortune sent , In each revolving year to be in triumph spent . Then in few weeks that cloudy brow had been Without a wonder or a whisper seen ; And none had been so weak as to inquire , “ Why pouts my Lady ? ” or “ Why frowns the Squire ? ” How fair these names , how much unlike they look To all the blurr 'd subscriptions in my book : The bridegroom 's letters stand in row above , Tapering yet stout , like pine-trees in his grove ; While free and fine the bride 's appear below , As light and slender as her jasmines grow . Mark now in what confusion stoop or stand The crooked scrawls of many a clownish hand ; Now out , now in , they droop , they fall , they rise , Like raw recruits drawn forth for exercise ; Ere yet reform 'd and modelled by the drill , The free-born legs stand striding as they will . Much have I tried to guide the fist along , But still the blunderers placed their blottings wrong : Behold these marks uncouth ! how strange that men Who guide the plough should fail to guide the pen : For half a mile the furrows even lie ; For half an inch the letters stand awry ; -  Our peasants , strong and sturdy in the field , Cannot these arms of idle students wield : Like them , in feudal days , their valiant lords Resign 'd the pen and grasp 'd their conqu'ring swords ; They to robed clerks and poor dependent men Left the light duties of the peaceful pen ; Nor to their ladies wrote , but sought to prove , By deeds of death , their hearts were fill 'd with love . But yet , small arts have charms for female eyes ; Our rustic nymphs the beau and scholar prize ; Unletter 'd swains and ploughmen coarse they slight , For those who dress , and amorous scrolls indite . For Lucy Collins happier days had been , Had Footman Daniel scorn 'd his native green , Or when he came an idle coxcomb down , Had he his love reserved for lass in town ; To Stephen Hill she then had pledged her truth , -  A sturdy , sober , kind , unpolish 'd youth : But from the day , that fatal day she spied The pride of Daniel , Daniel was her pride . In all concerns was Stephen just and true ; But coarse his doublet was and patch 'd in view , And felt his stockings were , and blacker than his shoe ; While Daniel 's linen all was fine and fair , -  His master wore it , and he deign 'd to wear : ( To wear his livery , some respect might prove ; To wear his linen , must be sign of love :) Blue was his coat , unsoil 'd by spot or stain ; His hose were silk , his shoes of Spanish grain ; A silver knot his breadth of shoulder bore ; A diamond buckle blazed his breast before -  Diamond he swore it was ! and show 'd it as he swore ; Rings on his fingers shone ; his milk-white hand Could pick-tooth case and box for snuff command : And thus , with clouded cane , a fop complete , He stalk 'd , the jest and glory of the street , Join 'd with these powers , he could so sweetly sing , Talk with such toss , and saunter with such swing ; Laugh with such glee , and trifle with such art , That Lucy 's promise fail 'd to shield her heart . Stephen , meantime , to ease his amorous cares , Fix 'd his full mind upon his farm 's affairs ; Two pigs , a cow , and wethers half a score , Increased his stock , and still he look 'd for more . He , for his acres few , so duly paid , That yet more acres to his lot were laid : Till our chaste nymphs no longer felt disdain , And prudent matrons praised the frugal swain ; Who thriving well , through many a fruitful year , Now clothed himself anew , and acted overseer . Just then poor Lucy , from her friend in town Fled in pure fear , and came a beggar down ; Trembling , at Stephen 's door she knocked for bread , -  Was chidden first , next pitied , and then fed ; Then sat at Stephen 's board , then shared in Stephen 's bed : All hope of marriage lost in her disgrace , He mourns a flame revived , and she a love of lace . Now to be wed a well-match 'd couple came ; Twice had old Lodge been tied , and twice the dame ; Tottering they came and toying , ( odious scene ! ) And fond and simple , as they 'd always been . Children from wedlock we by laws restrain ; Why not prevent them when they 're such again ? Why not forbid the doting souls to prove Th ’ indecent fondling of preposterous love ? In spite of prudence , uncontroll 'd by shame , The amorous senior woos the toothless dame , Relating idly , at the closing eve , The youthful follies he disdains to leave ; Till youthful follies wake a transient fire , When arm in arm they totter and retire . So a fond pair of solemn birds , all day Blink in their seat and doze the hours away ; Then by the moon awaken 'd , forth they move , And fright the songsters with their cheerless love ; So two sear trees , dry , stunted , and unsound , Each other catch , when dropping to the ground : Entwine their withered arms ‘ gainst wind and weather , And shake their leafless heads and drop together : So two cold limbs , touch 'd by Galvani 's wire , Move with new life , and feel awaken 'd fire ; Quivering awhile , their flaccid forms remain , Then turn to cold torpidity again . “ But ever frowns your Hymen ? man and maid , Are all repenting , suffering , or betray 'd ? ” Forbid it , Love ! we have our couples here Who hail the day in each revolving year : These are with us , as in the world around ; They are not frequent , but they may be found . Our farmers too , what though they fail to prove , In Hymen 's bonds , the tenderest slaves of love , ( Nor , like those pairs whom sentiment unites , Feel they the fervour of the mind 's delights ;) Yet coarsely kind and comfortably gay , They heap the board and hail the happy day : And though the bride , now freed from school , admits , Of pride implanted there , some transient fits ; Yet soon she casts her girlish flights aside , And in substantial blessings rest her pride . No more she moves in measured steps ; no more Runs , with bewilder 'd ear , her music o'er ; No more recites her French the hinds among , But chides her maidens in her mother-tongue ; Her tambour-frame she leaves and diet spare , Plain work and plenty with her house to share ; Till , all her varnish lost in few short years , In all her worth the farmer 's wife appears . Yet not the ancient kind ; nor she who gave Her soul to gain — a mistress and a slave : Who , not to sleep allow 'd the needful time ; To whom repose was loss , and sport a crime ; Who , in her meanest room ( and all were mean ) , A noisy drudge , from morn till night was seen ; -  But she , the daughter , boasts a decent room , Adorned with carpet , formed in Wilton 's loom ; Fair prints along the paper 'd wall are spread ; There , Werter sees the sportive children fed , And Charlotte , here , bewails her lover dead . ‘ Tis here , assembled , while in space apart Their husbands , drinking , warm the opening heart , Our neighbouring dames , on festal days , unite , With tongues more fluent and with hearts as light ; Theirs is that art , which English wives alone Profess — a boast and privilege their own ; An art it is where each at once attends To all , and claims attention from her friends , When they engage the tongue , the eye , the ear , Reply when listening , and when speaking hear : The ready converse knows no dull delays , “ But double are the pains , and double be the praise . ” Yet not to those alone who bear command Heaven gives a heart to hail the marriage band ; Among their servants , we the pairs can show , Who much to love and more to prudence owe : Reuben and Rachel , though as fond as doves , Were yet discreet and cautious in their loves ; Nor would attend to Cupid 's wild commands , Till cool reflection bade them join their hands : When both were poor , they thought it argued ill Of hasty love to make them poorer still ; Year after year , with savings long laid by , They bought the future dwelling 's full supply ; Her frugal fancy cull 'd the smaller ware , The weightier purchase ask 'd her Reuben 's care ; Together then their last year 's gain they threw , And lo ! an auction 'd bed , with curtains neat and new . Thus both , as prudence counsell 'd , wisely stay 'd , And cheerful then the calls of Love obeyed : What if , when Rachel gave her hand , ‘ twas one Embrown 'd by Winter 's ice and Summer 's sun ? What if , in Reuben 's hair the female eye Usurping grey among the black could spy ? What if , in both , life 's bloomy flush was lost , And their full autumn felt the mellowing frost ? Yet time , who blow 'd the rose of youth away , Had left the vigorous stem without decay ; Like those tall elms in Farmer Frankford 's ground , They 'll grow no more ,— but all their growth is sound ; By time confirm 'd and rooted in the land , The storms they 've stood , still promise they shall stand . These are the happier pairs , their life has rest , Their hopes are strong , their humble portion blest . While those more rash to hasty marriage led , Lament th ’ impatience which now stints their bread : When such their union , years their cares increase , Their love grows colder , and their pleasures cease ; In health just fed , in sickness just relieved ; By hardships harass 'd and by children grieved ; In petty quarrels and in peevish strife The once fond couple waste the spring of life ; But when to age mature those children grown , Find hopes and homes and hardships of their own , The harass 'd couple feel their lingering woes Receding slowly till they find repose . Complaints and murmurs then are laid aside , ( By reason these subdued , and those by pride ;) And , taught by care , the patient man and wife Agree to share the bitter-sweet of life ; ( Life that has sorrow much and sorrow 's cure , Where they who most enjoy shall much endure :) Their rest , their labours , duties , sufferings , prayers , Compose the soul , and fit it for its cares ; Their graves before them and their griefs behind , Have each a med'cine for the rustic mind ; Nor has he care to whom his wealth shall go , Or who shall labour with his spade and hoe ; But as he lends the strength that yet remains , And some dead neighbour on his bier sustains , ( One with whom oft he whirl 'd the bounding flail , Toss 'd the broad coit , or took the inspiring ale ,) “ For me , ” ( he meditates ,) “ shall soon be done This friendly duty , when my race be run ; ‘ Twas first in trouble as in error pass 'd , Dark clouds and stormy cares whole years o'ercast , But calm my setting day , and sunshine smiles at last : My vices punish 'd and my follies spent , Not loth to die , but yet to-live content , I rest : ” — then casting on the grave his eye , His friend compels a tear , and his own griefs a sigh . Last on my list appears a match of love , And one of virtue ;— happy may it prove ! - Sir Edward Archer is an amorous knight , And maidens chaste and lovely shun his sight ; His bailiff 's daughter suited much his taste , For Fanny Price was lovely and was chaste ; To her the Knight with gentle looks drew near , And timid voice assumed to banish fear : -  “ Hope of my life , dear sovereign of my breast , Which , since I knew thee , knows not joy nor rest ; Know , thou art all that my delighted eyes , My fondest thoughts , my proudest wishes prize ; And is that bosom — ( what on earth so fair ! ) To cradle some coarse peasant 's sprawling heir , To be that pillow which some surly swain May treat with scorn and agonise with pain ? Art thou , sweet maid , a ploughman 's wants to share , To dread his insult , to support his care ; To hear his follies , his contempt to prove , And ( oh ! the torment ! ) to endure his love ; Till want and deep regret those charms destroy , That time would spare , if time were pass 'd in joy ? With him , in varied pains , from morn till night , Your hours shall pass ; yourself a ruffian 's right ; Your softest bed shall be the knotted wool ; Your purest drink the waters of the pool ; Your sweetest food will but your life sustain , And your best pleasure be a rest from pain ; While , through each year , as health and strength abate , You 'll weep your woes and wonder at your fate ; And cry , ‘ Behold , ’ as life 's last cares come on , ‘ My burthens growing when my strength is gone . ’ “ Now turn with me , and all the young desire , That taste can form , that fancy can require ; All that excites enjoyment , or procures Wealth , health , respect , delight , and love , are yours : Sparkling , in cups of gold , your wines shall flow , Grace that fair hand , in that dear bosom glow ; Fruits of each clime , and flowers , through all the year Shall on your walls and in your walks appear : Where all beholding , shall your praise repeat , No fruit so tempting and no flower so sweet : The softest carpets in your rooms shall lie , Pictures of happiest love shall meet your eye , And tallest mirrors , reaching to the floor , Shall show you all the object I adore ; Who , by the hands of wealth and fashion dress 'd , By slaves attended and by friends caress 'd , Shall move , a wonder , through the public ways , And hear the whispers of adoring praise . Your female friends , though gayest of the gay , Shall see you happy , and shall , sighing , say , While smother 'd envy rises in the breast , -  ‘ Oh ! that we lived so beauteous and so blest ! ’ “ Come , then , my mistress , and my wife ; for she Who trusts my honour is the wife for me ; Your slave , your husband , and your friend employ In search of pleasures we may both enjoy . ” To this the Damsel , meekly firm , replied : “ My mother loved , was married , toil 'd , and died ; With joys she 'd griefs , had troubles in her course , But not one grief was pointed by remorse : My mind is fix 'd , to Heaven I resign , And be her love , her life , her comforts mine . ” Tyrants have wept ; and those with hearts of steel , Unused the anguish of the heart to heal , Have yet the transient power of virtue known , And felt th ’ imparted joy promote their own . Our Knight relenting , now befriends a youth , Who to the yielding maid had vow 'd his truth ; And finds in that fair deed a sacred joy , That will not perish , and that cannot cloy ; -  A living joy , that shall its spirits keep , When every beauty fades , and all the passions sleep .</docImprint>

     <l n="28">THERE was , ‘ tis said , and I believe , a time</l>
     <l n="29">When humble Christians died with views sublime ;</l>
     <l n="30">When all were ready for their faith to bleed ,</l>
     <l n="31">But few to write or wrangle for their creed ;</l>
     <l n="32">When lively Faith upheld the sinking heart ,</l>
     <l n="33">And friends , assured to meet , prepared to part ;</l>
     <l n="34">When Love felt hope , when Sorrow grew serene ,</l>
     <l n="35">And all was comfort in the death-bed scene .</l>
     <l n="36">Alas ! when now the gloomy king they wait ,</l>
     <l n="37">‘ Tis weakness yielding to resistless fate ;</l>
     <l n="38">Like wretched men upon the ocean cast ,</l>
     <l n="39">They labour hard and struggle to the last ;</l>
     <l n="40">“ Hope against hope , ” and wildly gaze around</l>
     <l n="41">In search of help that never shall be found :</l>
     <l n="42">Nor , till the last strong billow stops the breath ,</l>
     <l n="43">Will they believe them in the jaws of Death !</l>
     <l n="44">When these my Records I reflecting read ,</l>
     <l n="45">And find what ills these numerous births succeed ;</l>
     <l n="46">What powerful griefs these nuptial ties attend ;</l>
     <l n="47">With what regret these painful journeys end ;</l>
     <l n="48">When from the cradle to the grave I look ,</l>
     <l n="49">Mine I conceive a melancholy book .</l>
     <l n="50">Where now is perfect resignation seen ?</l>
     <l n="51">Alas ! it is not on the village-green : -</l>
     <l n="52">I 've seldom known , though I have often read ,</l>
     <l n="53">Of happy peasants on their dying-bed ;</l>
     <l n="54">Whose looks proclaimed that sunshine of the breast ,</l>
     <l n="55">That more than hope , that Heaven itself express 'd .</l>
     <l n="56">What I behold are feverish fits of strife ,</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Twixt fears of dying and desire of life :</l>
     <l n="58">Those earthly hopes , that to the last endure ;</l>
     <l n="59">Those fears , that hopes superior fail to cure ;</l>
     <l n="60">At best a sad submission to the doom ,</l>
     <l n="61">Which , turning from the danger , lets it come .</l>
     <l n="62">Sick lies the man , bewilder 'd , lost , afraid ,</l>
     <l n="63">His spirits vanquish 'd , and his strength decay 'd ;</l>
     <l n="64">No hope the friend , the nurse , the doctor lend -</l>
     <l n="65">“ Call then a priest , and fit him for his end . ”</l>
     <l n="66">A priest is call 'd ; ‘ tis now , alas ! too late ,</l>
     <l n="67">Death enters with him at the cottage-gate ;</l>
     <l n="68">Or time allow 'd — he goes , assured to find</l>
     <l n="69">The self-commending , all-confiding mind ;</l>
     <l n="70">And sighs to hear , what we may justly call</l>
     <l n="71">Death 's common-place , the train of thought in all .</l>
     <l n="72">“ True I 'm a sinner , ” feebly he begins ,</l>
     <l n="73">“ But trust in Mercy to forgive my sins : ”</l>
     <l n="74">( Such cool confession no past crimes excite !</l>
     <l n="75">Such claim on Mercy seems the sinner 's right ! )</l>
     <l n="76">“ I know mankind are frail , that God is just ,</l>
     <l n="77">And pardons those who in his Mercy trust ;</l>
     <l n="78">We 're sorely tempted in a world like this -</l>
     <l n="79">All men have done , and I like all , amiss ;</l>
     <l n="80">But now , if spared , it is my full intent</l>
     <l n="81">On all the past to ponder and repent :</l>
     <l n="82">Wrongs against me I pardon great and small ,</l>
     <l n="83">And if I die , I die in peace with all . ”</l>
     <l n="84">His merits thus and not his sins confess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="85">He speaks his hopes , and leaves to Heaven the rest .</l>
     <l n="86">Alas ! are these the prospects , dull and cold ,</l>
     <l n="87">That dying Christians to their priests unfold ?</l>
     <l n="88">Or mends the prospect when th ’ enthusiast cries ,</l>
     <l n="89">“ I die assured ! ” and in a rapture dies ?</l>
     <l n="90">Ah , where that humble , self-abasing mind ,</l>
     <l n="91">With that confiding spirit , shall we find ;</l>
     <l n="92">The mind that , feeling what repentance brings ,</l>
     <l n="93">Dejection 's terrors and Contrition 's stings ,</l>
     <l n="94">Feels then the hope that mounts all care above ,</l>
     <l n="95">And the pure joy that flows from pardoning love ?</l>
     <l n="96">Such have I seen in Death , and much deplore ,</l>
     <l n="97">So many dying — that I see no more :</l>
     <l n="98">Lo ! now my Records , where I grieve to trace</l>
     <l n="99">How Death has triumph 'd in so short a space ;</l>
     <l n="100">Who are the dead , how died they , I relate ,</l>
     <l n="101">And snatch some portion of their acts from fate .</l>
     <l n="102">With Andrew Collett we the year begin ,</l>
     <l n="103">The blind , fat landlord of the Old Crown Inn , -</l>
     <l n="104">Big as his butt , and , for the selfsame use ,</l>
     <l n="105">To take in stores of strong fermenting juice .</l>
     <l n="106">On his huge chair beside the fire he sate ,</l>
     <l n="107">In revel chief , and umpire in debate ;</l>
     <l n="108">Each night his string of vulgar tales he told ,</l>
     <l n="109">When ale was cheap and bachelors were bold :</l>
     <l n="110">His heroes all were famous in their days ,</l>
     <l n="111">Cheats were his boast , and drunkards had his praise ;</l>
     <l n="112">“ One , in three draughts , three mugs of ale took down ,</l>
     <l n="113">As mugs were then — the champion of the Crown ;</l>
     <l n="114">For thrice three days another lived on ale ,</l>
     <l n="115">And knew no change but that of mild and stale ;</l>
     <l n="116">Two thirsty soakers watch 'd a vessel 's side ,</l>
     <l n="117">When he the tap , with dext'rous hand , applied ;</l>
     <l n="118">Nor from their seats departed , till they found</l>
     <l n="119">That butt was out and heard the mournful sound . ”</l>
     <l n="120">He praised a poacher , precious child of fun !</l>
     <l n="121">Who shot the keeper with his own spring gun ;</l>
     <l n="122">Nor less the smuggler who th ’ exciseman tied ,</l>
     <l n="123">And left him hanging at the birch-wood side ,</l>
     <l n="124">There to expire ;— but one who saw him hang</l>
     <l n="125">Cut the good cord — a traitor of the gang .</l>
     <l n="126">His own exploits with boastful glee he told ,</l>
     <l n="127">What ponds he emptied and what pikes he sold ;</l>
     <l n="128">And how , when blest with sight alert and gay ,</l>
     <l n="129">The night 's amusements kept him through the day .</l>
     <l n="130">He sang the praises of those times , when all</l>
     <l n="131">“ For cards and dice , as for their drink , might call ;</l>
     <l n="132">When justice wink 'd on every jovial crew ,</l>
     <l n="133">And ten-pins tumbled in the parson 's view . ”</l>
     <l n="134">He told , when angry wives , provoked to rail ,</l>
     <l n="135">Or drive a third-day drunkard from his ale ,</l>
     <l n="136">What were his triumphs , and how great the skill</l>
     <l n="137">That won the vex 'd virago to his will ;</l>
     <l n="138">Who raving came ;— then talked in milder strain , -</l>
     <l n="139">Then wept , then drank , and pledged her spouse again .</l>
     <l n="140">Such were his themes : how knaves o'er laws prevail ,</l>
     <l n="141">Or , when made captives , how they fly from jail ;</l>
     <l n="142">The young how brave , how subtle were the old :</l>
     <l n="143">And oaths attested all that Folly told .</l>
     <l n="144">On death like his what name shall we bestow ,</l>
     <l n="145">So very sudden ! yet so very slow ?</l>
     <l n="146">‘ Twas slow : — Disease , augmenting year by year ,</l>
     <l n="147">Show 'd the grim king by gradual steps brought near :</l>
     <l n="148">‘ Twas not less sudden ; in the night he died ,</l>
     <l n="149">He drank , he swore , he jested , and he lied ;</l>
     <l n="150">Thus aiding folly with departing breath : -</l>
     <l n="151">“ Beware , Lorenzo , the slow-sudden death . ”</l>
     <l n="152">Next died the Widow Goe , an active dame ,</l>
     <l n="153">Famed ten miles round , and worthy all her fame ;</l>
     <l n="154">She lost her husband when their loves were young ,</l>
     <l n="155">But kept her farm , her credit , and her tongue :</l>
     <l n="156">Full thirty years she ruled , with matchless skill ,</l>
     <l n="157">With guiding judgment and resistless will ;</l>
     <l n="158">Advice she scorn 'd , rebellions she suppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="159">And sons and servants bow 'd at her behest .</l>
     <l n="160">Like that great man 's , who to his Saviour came ,</l>
     <l n="161">Were the strong words of this commanding dame ; -</l>
     <l n="162">“ Come , ” if she said , they came ; if “ Go , ” were gone ;</l>
     <l n="163">And if “ Do this , ” — that instant it was done :</l>
     <l n="164">Her maidens told she was all eye and ear ,</l>
     <l n="165">In darkness saw and could at distance hear ;</l>
     <l n="166">No parish-business in the place could stir ,</l>
     <l n="167">Without direction or assent from her ;</l>
     <l n="168">In turn she took each office as it fell ,</l>
     <l n="169">Knew all their duties and discharged them well ;</l>
     <l n="170">The lazy vagrants in her presence shook ,</l>
     <l n="171">And pregnant damsels fear 'd her stern rebuke ;</l>
     <l n="172">She look 'd on want with judgment clear and cool ,</l>
     <l n="173">And felt with reason and bestow 'd by rule ;</l>
     <l n="174">She match 'd both sons and daughters to her mind ,</l>
     <l n="175">And lent them eyes , for Love , she heard , was blind ;</l>
     <l n="176">Yet ceaseless still she throve , alert , alive ,</l>
     <l n="177">The working bee , in full or empty hive ;</l>
     <l n="178">Busy and careful , like that working bee ,</l>
     <l n="179">No time for love nor tender cares had she ;</l>
     <l n="180">But when our farmers made their amorous vows ,</l>
     <l n="181">She talk 'd of market-steeds and patent-ploughs .</l>
     <l n="182">Not unemploy 'd her evenings pass 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="183">Amusement closed , as business waked the day ;</l>
     <l n="184">When to her toilet 's brief concern she ran ,</l>
     <l n="185">And conversation with her friends began ,</l>
     <l n="186">Who all were welcome , what they saw , to share ;</l>
     <l n="187">And joyous neighbours praised her Christmas fare ,</l>
     <l n="188">That none around might , in their scorn , complain</l>
     <l n="189">Of Gossip Goe as greedy in her gain .</l>
     <l n="190">Thus long she reign 'd , admired , if not approved ;</l>
     <l n="191">Praised , if not honour 'd ; fear 'd , if not beloved ; -</l>
     <l n="192">When , as the busy days of Spring drew near ,</l>
     <l n="193">That call 'd for all the forecast of the year ;</l>
     <l n="194">When lively hope the rising crops surveyed ,</l>
     <l n="195">And April promised what September paid ;</l>
     <l n="196">When stray 'd her lambs where gorse and greenwood grow ;</l>
     <l n="197">When rose her grass in richer vales below ;</l>
     <l n="198">When pleased she look 'd on all the smiling land ,</l>
     <l n="199">And view 'd the hinds , who wrought at her command ;</l>
     <l n="200">( Poultry in groups still follow 'd where she went ;)</l>
     <l n="201">Then dread o'ercame her ,— that her days were spent .</l>
     <l n="202">“ Bless me ! I die , and not a warning giv'n , -</l>
     <l n="203">With MUCH to do on Earth , and ALL for Heav'n ? -</l>
     <l n="204">No reparation for my soul 's affairs ,</l>
     <l n="205">No leave petition 'd for the barn 's repairs ;</l>
     <l n="206">Accounts perplex 'd , my interest yet unpaid ,</l>
     <l n="207">My mind unsettled , and my will unmade ; -</l>
     <l n="208">A lawyer haste , and in your way , a priest ;</l>
     <l n="209">And let me die in one good work at least . ”</l>
     <l n="210">She spake , and , trembling , dropp 'd upon her knees ,</l>
     <l n="211">Heaven in her eye and in her hand her keys ;</l>
     <l n="212">And still the more she found her life decay ,</l>
     <l n="213">With greater force she grasp 'd those signs of sway :</l>
     <l n="214">Then fell and died !— In haste her sons drew near ,</l>
     <l n="215">And dropp 'd , in haste , the tributary tear ;</l>
     <l n="216">Then from th ’ adhering clasp the keys unbound ,</l>
     <l n="217">And consolation for their sorrows found .</l>
     <l n="218">Death has his infant-train ; his bony arm</l>
     <l n="219">Strikes from the baby-cheek the rosy charm ;</l>
     <l n="220">The brightest eye his glazing film makes dim ,</l>
     <l n="221">And his cold touch sets fast the lithest limb :</l>
     <l n="222">He seized the sick'ning boy to Gerard lent ,</l>
     <l n="223">When three days ’ life , in feeble cries , were spent ;</l>
     <l n="224">In pain brought forth , those painful hours to stay ,</l>
     <l n="225">To breathe in pain and sigh its soul away !</l>
     <l n="226">“ But why thus lent , if thus recall 'd again ,</l>
     <l n="227">To cause and feel , to live and die in pain ? ”</l>
     <l n="228">Or rather say , Why grevious these appear ,</l>
     <l n="229">If all it pays for Heaven 's eternal year ;</l>
     <l n="230">If these sad sobs and piteous sighs secure</l>
     <l n="231">Delights that live , when worlds no more endure ?</l>
     <l n="232">The sister-spirit long may lodge below ,</l>
     <l n="233">And pains from nature , pains from reason , know :</l>
     <l n="234">Through all the common ills of life may run ,</l>
     <l n="235">By hope perverted and by love undone ;</l>
     <l n="236">A wife 's distress , a mother 's pangs , may dread ,</l>
     <l n="237">And widow-tears , in bitter anguish , shed ;</l>
     <l n="238">May at old age arrive through numerous harms ,</l>
     <l n="239">With children 's children in those feeble arms :</l>
     <l n="240">Nor till by years of want and grief oppress 'd</l>
     <l n="241">Shall the sad spirit flee and be at rest !</l>
     <l n="242">Yet happier therefore shall we deem the boy ,</l>
     <l n="243">Secured from anxious care and dangerous joy ?</l>
     <l n="244">Not so ! for then would Love Divine in vain</l>
     <l n="245">Send all the burthens weary men sustain ;</l>
     <l n="246">All that now curb the passions when they rage ,</l>
     <l n="247">The checks of youth and the regrets of age ;</l>
     <l n="248">All that now bid us hope , believe , endure ,</l>
     <l n="249">Our sorrow 's comfort and our vice 's cure ;</l>
     <l n="250">All that for Heaven 's high joys the spirits train ,</l>
     <l n="251">And charity , the crown of all , were vain .</l>
     <l n="252">Say , will you call the breathless infant blest ,</l>
     <l n="253">Because no cares the silent grave molest ?</l>
     <l n="254">So would you deem the nursling from the wing</l>
     <l n="255">Untimely thrust and never train 'd to sing ;</l>
     <l n="256">But far more blest the bird whose grateful voice</l>
     <l n="257">Sings its own joy and makes the woods rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="258">Though , while untaught , ere yet he charm 'd the ear ,</l>
     <l n="259">Hard were his trials and his pains severe !</l>
     <l n="260">Next died the LADY who yon Hall possess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="261">And here they brought her noble bones to rest .</l>
     <l n="262">In Town she dwelt ;— forsaken stood the Hall :</l>
     <l n="263">Worms ate the floors , the tap'stry fled the wall :</l>
     <l n="264">No fire the kitchen 's cheerless grate display 'd ;</l>
     <l n="265">No cheerful light the long-closed sash convey 'd :</l>
     <l n="266">The crawling worm , that turns a summer fly ,</l>
     <l n="267">Here spun his shroud and laid him up to die</l>
     <l n="268">The winter-death : -  upon the bed of state ,</l>
     <l n="269">The bat shrill shrieking woo 'd his flickering mate ;</l>
     <l n="270">To empty rooms the curious came no more ;</l>
     <l n="271">From empty cellars turn 'd the angry poor ,</l>
     <l n="272">And surly beggars cursed the ever-bolted door .</l>
     <l n="273">To one small room the steward found his way</l>
     <l n="274">Where tenants follow 'd to complain and pay ;</l>
     <l n="275">Yet no complaint before the Lady came ,</l>
     <l n="276">The feeling servant spared the feeble dame ;</l>
     <l n="277">Who saw her farms with his observing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="278">And answer 'd all requests with his replies ; -</l>
     <l n="279">She came not down , her falling groves to view ;</l>
     <l n="280">Why should she know , what one so faithful knew ?</l>
     <l n="281">Why come , from many clamorous tongues to hear ,</l>
     <l n="282">What one so just might whisper in her ear ?</l>
     <l n="283">Her oaks or acres , why with care explore ;</l>
     <l n="284">Why learn the wants , the sufferings of the poor ;</l>
     <l n="285">When one so knowing all their worth could trace ,</l>
     <l n="286">And one so piteous govern 'd in her place ?</l>
     <l n="287">Lo ! now , what dismal Sons of Darkness come ,</l>
     <l n="288">To bear this Daughter of Indulgence home ;</l>
     <l n="289">Tragedians all , and well-arranged in black !</l>
     <l n="290">Who nature , feeling , force , expression lack ;</l>
     <l n="291">Who cause no tear , but gloomily pass by ,</l>
     <l n="292">And shake their sables in the wearied eye ,</l>
     <l n="293">That turns disgusted from the pompous scene ,</l>
     <l n="294">Proud without grandeur , with profusion , mean</l>
     <l n="295">The tear for kindness past affection owes ;</l>
     <l n="296">For worth deceased the sigh from reason flows</l>
     <l n="297">E'en well feign 'd passion for our sorrows call ,</l>
     <l n="298">And real tears for mimic miseries fall :</l>
     <l n="299">But this poor farce has neither truth nor art ,</l>
     <l n="300">To please the fancy or to touch the heart ;</l>
     <l n="301">Unlike the darkness of the sky , that pours</l>
     <l n="302">On the dry ground its fertilizing showers ;</l>
     <l n="303">Unlike to that which strikes the soul with dread ,</l>
     <l n="304">When thunders roar and forky fires are shed ;</l>
     <l n="305">Dark but not awful , dismal but yet mean ,</l>
     <l n="306">With anxious bustle moves the cumbrous scene ;</l>
     <l n="307">Presents no objects tender or profound ,</l>
     <l n="308">But spreads its cold unmeaning gloom around .</l>
     <l n="309">When woes are feign 'd , how ill such forms appear ,</l>
     <l n="310">And oh ! how needless , when the woe 's sincere .</l>
     <l n="311">Slow to the vault they come , with heavy tread ,</l>
     <l n="312">Bending beneath the Lady and her lead ;</l>
     <l n="313">A case of elm surrounds that ponderous chest ,</l>
     <l n="314">Close on that case the crimson velvet 's press 'd ;</l>
     <l n="315">Ungenerous this , that to the worm denies ,</l>
     <l n="316">With niggard-caution , his appointed prize ;</l>
     <l n="317">For now , ere yet he works his tedious way ,</l>
     <l n="318">Through cloth and wood and metal to his prey ,</l>
     <l n="319">That prey dissolving shall a mass remain ,</l>
     <l n="320">That fancy loathes and worms themselves disdain .</l>
     <l n="321">But see ! the master-mourner makes his way ,</l>
     <l n="322">To end his office for the coffin 'd clay ;</l>
     <l n="323">Pleased that our rustic men and maids behold</l>
     <l n="324">His plate like silver , and his studs like gold ,</l>
     <l n="325">As they approach to spell the age , the name ,</l>
     <l n="326">And all the titles of the illustrious dame. - </l>
     <l n="327">This as ( my duty done ) some scholar read ,</l>
     <l n="328">A Village-father look 'd disdain and said :</l>
     <l n="329">“ Away , my friends ! why take such pains to know</l>
     <l n="330">What some brave marble soon in church shall show ?</l>
     <l n="331">Where not alone her gracious name shall stand ,</l>
     <l n="332">But how she lived — the blessing of the land ;</l>
     <l n="333">How much we all deplored the noble dead ,</l>
     <l n="334">What groans we utter 'd and what tears we shed ;</l>
     <l n="335">Tears , true as those which in the sleepy eyes</l>
     <l n="336">Of weeping cherubs on the stone shall rise ;</l>
     <l n="337">Tears , true as those which , ere she found her grave ,</l>
     <l n="338">The noble Lady to our sorrows gave . ”</l>
     <l n="339">Down by the church-way walk , and where the brook</l>
     <l n="340">Winds round the chancel like a shepherd 's crook ;</l>
     <l n="341">In that small house , with those green pales before ,</l>
     <l n="342">Where jasmine trails on either side the door ;</l>
     <l n="343">Where those dark shrubs , that now grow wild at will ,</l>
     <l n="344">Were clipped in form and tantalised with skill ;</l>
     <l n="345">Where cockles blanch 'd and pebbles neatly spread ,</l>
     <l n="346">Form 'd shining borders for the larkspurs ’ bed ;</l>
     <l n="347">There lived a Lady , wise , austere , and nice ,</l>
     <l n="348">Who show 'd her virtue by her scorn of vice ;</l>
     <l n="349">In the dear fashions of her youth she dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="350">A pea-green Joseph was her favourite vest ;</l>
     <l n="351">Erect she stood , she walk 'd with stately mien ,</l>
     <l n="352">Tight was her length of stays , and she was tall and lean .</l>
     <l n="353">There long she lived in maiden-state immured ,</l>
     <l n="354">From looks of love and treacherous man secured ;</l>
     <l n="355">Though evil fame — ( but that was long before )</l>
     <l n="356">Had blown her dubious blast at Catherine 's door :</l>
     <l n="357">A Captain thither , rich from India came ,</l>
     <l n="358">And though a cousin call 'd , it touch 'd her fame :</l>
     <l n="359">Her annual stipend rose from his behest ,</l>
     <l n="360">And all the long-prized treasures she possess 'd : -</l>
     <l n="361">If aught like joy awhile appear 'd to stay</l>
     <l n="362">In that stern face , and chase those frowns away ,</l>
     <l n="363">‘ Twas when her treasures she disposed for view</l>
     <l n="364">And heard the praises to their splendour due ;</l>
     <l n="365">Silks beyond price , so rich , they 'd stand alone ,</l>
     <l n="366">And diamonds blazing on the buckled zone ;</l>
     <l n="367">Rows of rare pearls by curious workmen set ,</l>
     <l n="368">And bracelets fair in box of glossy jet ;</l>
     <l n="369">Bright polish 'd amber precious from its size ,</l>
     <l n="370">Or forms the fairest fancy could devise :</l>
     <l n="371">Her drawers of cedar , shut with secret springs ,</l>
     <l n="372">Conceal 'd the watch of gold and rubied rings ;</l>
     <l n="373">Letters , long proofs of love , and verses fine</l>
     <l n="374">Round the pink 'd rims of crisped Valentine .</l>
     <l n="375">Her china-closet , cause of daily care ,</l>
     <l n="376">For woman 's wonder held her pencill 'd ware ;</l>
     <l n="377">That pictured wealth of China and Japan ,</l>
     <l n="378">Like its cold mistress , shunn 'd the eye of man .</l>
     <l n="379">Her neat small room , adorn 'd with maiden-taste ,</l>
     <l n="380">A clipp 'd French puppy , first of favourites , graced :</l>
     <l n="381">A parrot next , but dead and stuff 'd with art ;</l>
     <l n="382">( For Poll , when living , lost the Lady 's heart ,</l>
     <l n="383">And then his life ; for he was heard to speak</l>
     <l n="384">Such frightful words as tinged his Lady 's cheek :)</l>
     <l n="385">Unhappy bird ! who had no power to prove ,</l>
     <l n="386">Save by such speech , his gratitude and love .</l>
     <l n="387">A gray old cat his whiskers lick 'd beside ;</l>
     <l n="388">A type of sadness in the house of pride .</l>
     <l n="389">The polish 'd surface of an India chest ,</l>
     <l n="390">A glassy globe , in frame of ivory , press 'd ;</l>
     <l n="391">Where swam two finny creatures ; one of gold ,</l>
     <l n="392">Of silver one ; both beauteous to behold : -</l>
     <l n="393">All these were form 'd the guiding taste to suit ;</l>
     <l n="394">The beast well-manner 'd and the fishes mute .</l>
     <l n="395">A widow 'd Aunt was there , compell 'd by need</l>
     <l n="396">The nymph to flatter and her tribe to feed ;</l>
     <l n="397">Who veiling well her scorn , endured the clog ,</l>
     <l n="398">Mute as the fish and fawning as the dog .</l>
     <l n="399">As years increased , these treasures , her delight ,</l>
     <l n="400">Arose in value in their owner 's sight :</l>
     <l n="401">A miser knows that , view it as he will ,</l>
     <l n="402">A guinea kept is but a guinea still ;</l>
     <l n="403">And so he puts it to its proper use ,</l>
     <l n="404">That something more this guinea may produce ;</l>
     <l n="405">But silks and rings , in the possessor 's eyes ,</l>
     <l n="406">The oft'ner seen , the more in value rise ,</l>
     <l n="407">And thus are wisely hoarded to bestow</l>
     <l n="408">The kind of pleasure that with years will grow .</l>
     <l n="409">But what avail 'd their worth — if worth had they -</l>
     <l n="410">In the sad summer of her slow decay ?</l>
     <l n="411">Then we beheld her turn an anxious look</l>
     <l n="412">From trunks and chests , and fix it on her book , -</l>
     <l n="413">A rich-bound Book of Prayer the Captain gave ,</l>
     <l n="414">( Some Princess had it , or was said to have ;)</l>
     <l n="415">And then once more on all her stores look round ,</l>
     <l n="416">And draw a sigh so piteous and profound ,</l>
     <l n="417">That told , “ Alas ! how hard from these to part ,</l>
     <l n="418">And for new hopes and habits form the heart !</l>
     <l n="419">What shall I do ( she cried ,) my peace of mind</l>
     <l n="420">To gain in dying , and to die resign 'd ? ”</l>
     <l n="421">“ Hear , ” we return 'd ;— “ these baubles cast aside ,</l>
     <l n="422">Nor give thy God a rival in thy pride ;</l>

     <l n="430">Alas ! ‘ twas hard ; the treasures still had charms ,</l>
     <l n="431">Hope still its flattery , sickness its alarms ;</l>
     <l n="432">Still was the same unsettled , clouded view ,</l>
     <l n="433">And the same plaintive cry , “ What shall I do ? ”</l>
     <l n="434">Nor change appear 'd ; for when her race was run ,</l>
     <l n="435">Doubtful we all exclaim 'd , “ What has been done ? ”</l>
     <l n="436">Apart she lived , and still she lies alone ;</l>

     <l n="438">On which invention shall be long employ 'd ,</l>
     <l n="439">To show the various worth of Catherine Lloyd .</l>
     <l n="440">Next to these ladies , but in nought allied ,</l>
     <l n="441">A noble Peasant , Isaac Ashford , died .</l>
     <l n="442">Noble he was , contemning all things mean ,</l>
     <l n="443">His truth unquestion 'd and his soul serene :</l>
     <l n="444">Of no man 's presence Isaac felt afraid ;</l>
     <l n="445">At no man 's question Isaac looked dismay 'd :</l>
     <l n="446">Shame knew him not , he dreaded no disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="447">Truth , simple truth , was written in his face :</l>
     <l n="448">Yet while the serious thought his soul approved ,</l>
     <l n="449">Cheerful he seem 'd , and gentleness he loved ;</l>
     <l n="450">To bliss domestic he his heart resign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="451">And with the firmest had the fondest mind ;</l>
     <l n="452">Were others joyful , he look 'd smiling on ,</l>
     <l n="453">And gave allowance where he needed none ;</l>
     <l n="454">Good he refused with future ill to buy ,</l>
     <l n="455">Nor knew a joy that caused reflection 's sigh ;</l>
     <l n="456">A friend to virtue , his unclouded breast</l>
     <l n="457">No envy stung , no jealousy distress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="458">( Bane of the poor ! it wounds their weaker mind ,</l>
     <l n="459">To miss one favour , which their neighbours find :)</l>
     <l n="460">Yet far was he from stoic pride removed ;</l>
     <l n="461">He felt humanely , and he warmly loved :</l>
     <l n="462">I mark 'd his action , when his infant died ,</l>
     <l n="463">And his old neighbour for offence was tried ;</l>
     <l n="464">The still tears , stealing down that furrow 'd cheek ,</l>
     <l n="465">Spoke pity , plainer than the tongue can speak .</l>
     <l n="466">If pride were his , ‘ twas not their vulgar pride ,</l>
     <l n="467">Who , in their base contempt , the great deride ;</l>
     <l n="468">Nor pride in learning ,— though my Clerk agreed ,</l>
     <l n="469">If fate should call him , Ashford might succeed ;</l>
     <l n="470">Nor pride in rustic skill , although we knew</l>
     <l n="471">None his superior , and his equals few : -</l>
     <l n="472">But if that spirit in his soul had place ,</l>
     <l n="473">It was the jealous pride that shuns disgrace ;</l>
     <l n="474">A pride in honest fame , by virtue gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="475">In sturdy boys to virtuous labours train 'd ;</l>
     <l n="476">Pride in the power that guards his country 's coast ,</l>
     <l n="477">And all that Englishmen enjoy and boast ;</l>
     <l n="478">Pride in a life that slander 's tongue defied , -</l>
     <l n="479">In fact a noble passion , misnamed Pride .</l>
     <l n="480">He had no party 's rage , no sect'ry ' s whim ;</l>
     <l n="481">Christian and countrymen was all with him :</l>

     <l n="483">Kept him at home in that important hour ;</l>
     <l n="484">Nor his firm feet could one persuading sect ,</l>
     <l n="485">By the strong glare of their new light direct : -</l>
     <l n="486">“ On hope , in mine own sober light , I gaze ,</l>
     <l n="487">But should be blind , and lose it , in your blaze . ”</l>
     <l n="488">In times severe , when many a sturdy swain</l>
     <l n="489">Felt it his pride , his comfort to complain ;</l>
     <l n="490">Isaac their wants would soothe , his own would hide ,</l>
     <l n="491">And feel in that his comfort and his pride .</l>
     <l n="492">At length he found when seventy years were run ,</l>
     <l n="493">His strength departed , and his labour done ;</l>
     <l n="494">When he , save honest fame , retain 'd no more ,</l>
     <l n="495">But lost his wife , and saw his children poor :</l>
     <l n="496">‘ Twas then a spark of — say not discontent -</l>
     <l n="497">Struck on his mind , and thus he gave it vent : -</l>
     <l n="498">“ Kind are your laws ( ‘ tis not to be denied ,)</l>
     <l n="499">That in yon House for ruin 'd age provide ,</l>

     <l n="501">And for assistance in our weakness call. - </l>
     <l n="502">Why then this proud reluctance to be fed ,</l>
     <l n="503">To join your poor , and eat the parish bread ?</l>
     <l n="504">But yet I linger , loth with him to feed ,</l>
     <l n="505">Who gains his plenty by the sons of need ;</l>
     <l n="506">He who , by contract , all your paupers took ,</l>
     <l n="507">And gauges stomachs with an anxious look :</l>
     <l n="508">On some old master I could well depend ;</l>
     <l n="509">See him with joy and thank him as a friend ;</l>
     <l n="510">But ill on him who doles the day 's supply ,</l>
     <l n="511">And counts our chances who at night may die :</l>
     <l n="512">Yet help me , Heav'n ! and let me not complain</l>
     <l n="513">Of what I suffer , but my fate sustain . ”</l>
     <l n="514">Such were his thoughts , and so resign 'd he grew ;</l>
     <l n="515">Daily he placed the Workhouse in his view !</l>
     <l n="516">But came not there , for sudden was his fate ,</l>
     <l n="517">He dropp 'd , expiring , at his cottage gate .</l>
     <l n="518">I feel his absence in the hours of prayer ,</l>
     <l n="519">And view his seat , and sigh for Isaac there :</l>
     <l n="520">I see no more these white locks thinly spread</l>
     <l n="521">Round the bald polish of that honour 'd head ;</l>
     <l n="522">No more that awful glance on playful wight ,</l>
     <l n="523">Compell 'd to kneel and tremble at the sight ,</l>
     <l n="524">To fold his fingers , all in dread the while ,</l>
     <l n="525">Till Mister Ashford soften 'd to a smile ;</l>
     <l n="526">No more that meek and suppliant look in prayer ,</l>
     <l n="527">Nor the pure faith ( to give it force ) , are there : -</l>
     <l n="528">But he is blest , and I lament no more</l>
     <l n="529">A wise good man contented to be poor .</l>
     <l n="530">Then died a Rambler : not the one who sails ,</l>
     <l n="531">And trucks , for female favours , beads and nails ;</l>
     <l n="532">Not one who posts from place to place — of men</l>
     <l n="533">And manners treating with a flying pen ;</l>
     <l n="534">Not he who climbs , for prospects , Snowdon 's height ,</l>
     <l n="535">And chides the clouds that intercept the sight ;</l>
     <l n="536">No curious shell , rare plant , or brilliant spar ,</l>
     <l n="537">Enticed our traveller from his house so far ;</l>
     <l n="538">But all the reason by himself assign 'd</l>
     <l n="539">For so much rambling , was a restless mind ;</l>
     <l n="540">As on , from place to place , without intent ,</l>
     <l n="541">Without reflection , Robin Dingley went .</l>
     <l n="542">Not thus by nature : -  never man was found</l>
     <l n="543">Less prone to wander from his parish bound :</l>
     <l n="544">Claudian 's Old Man , to whom all scenes were new ,</l>
     <l n="545">Save those where he and where his apples grew ,</l>
     <l n="546">Resembled Robin , who around would look ,</l>
     <l n="547">And his horizon for the earth 's mistook .</l>
     <l n="548">To this poor swain a keen Attorney came ; -</l>
     <l n="549">“ I give thee joy , good fellow ! on thy name ;</l>
     <l n="550">The rich old Dingley 's dead ;— no child has he ,</l>
     <l n="551">Nor wife , nor will ; his ALL is left for thee :</l>
     <l n="552">To be his fortune 's heir thy claim is good ;</l>
     <l n="553">Thou hast the name , and we will prove the blood . ”</l>
     <l n="554">The claim was made ; ‘ twas tried ,— it would not stand ;</l>
     <l n="555">They proved the blood but were refused the land .</l>
     <l n="556">Assured of wealth , this man of simple heart</l>
     <l n="557">To every friend had predisposed a part ;</l>
     <l n="558">His wife had hopes indulged of various kind ;</l>
     <l n="559">The three Miss Dingleys had their school assign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="560">Masters were sought for what they each required ,</l>
     <l n="561">And books were bought and harpsichords were hired ;</l>
     <l n="562">So high was hope : -  the failure touched his brain ,</l>
     <l n="563">And Robin never was himself again ;</l>
     <l n="564">Yet he no wrath , no angry wish express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="565">But tried , in vain , to labour or to rest ;</l>
     <l n="566">Then cast his bundle on his back , and went</l>
     <l n="567">He knew not whither , nor for what intent .</l>
     <l n="568">Years fled ;— of Robin all remembrance past ,</l>
     <l n="569">When home he wandered in his rags at last :</l>
     <l n="570">A sailor 's jacket on his limbs was thrown ,</l>
     <l n="571">A sailor 's story he had made his own ;</l>
     <l n="572">Had suffer 'd battles , prisons , tempests , storms ,</l>
     <l n="573">Encountering death in all its ugliest forms :</l>
     <l n="574">His cheeks were haggard , hollow was his eye ,</l>
     <l n="575">Where madness lurk 'd , conceal 'd in misery ;</l>
     <l n="576">Want , and th ’ ungentle world , had taught a part ,</l>
     <l n="577">And prompted cunning to that simple heart :</l>
     <l n="578">“ He now bethought him , he would roam no more</l>
     <l n="579">But live at home and labour as before . ”</l>
     <l n="580">Here clothed and fed , no sooner he began</l>
     <l n="581">To round and redden , than away he ran ;</l>
     <l n="582">His wife was dead , their children past his aid ,</l>
     <l n="583">So , unmolested , from his home he stray 'd :</l>
     <l n="584">Six years elapsed , when , worn with want and pain .</l>
     <l n="585">Came Robin , wrapt in all his rags again :</l>
     <l n="586">We chide , we pity ;— placed among our poor ,</l>
     <l n="587">He fed again , and was a man once more .</l>
     <l n="588">As when a gaunt and hungry fox is found ,</l>
     <l n="589">Entrapp 'd alive in some rich hunter 's ground ;</l>
     <l n="590">Fed for the field , although each day 's a feast ,</l>
     <l n="591">FATTEN you may , but never TAME the beast ;</l>
     <l n="592">A house protects him , savoury viands sustain : -</l>
     <l n="593">But loose his neck and off he goes again :</l>
     <l n="594">So stole our Vagrant from his warm retreat ,</l>
     <l n="595">To rove a prowler and be deemed a cheat .</l>
     <l n="596">Hard was his fare ; for him at length we saw</l>
     <l n="597">In cart convey 'd and laid supine on straw .</l>
     <l n="598">His feeble voice now spoke a sinking heart ;</l>
     <l n="599">His groans now told the motions of the cart :</l>
     <l n="600">And when it stopp 'd , he tried in vain to stand ;</l>
     <l n="601">Closed was his eye , and clench 'd his clammy hand :</l>
     <l n="602">Life ebb 'd apace , and our best aid no more</l>
     <l n="603">Could his weak sense or dying heart restore :</l>
     <l n="604">But now he fell , a victim to the snare</l>
     <l n="605">That vile attorneys for the weak prepare ;</l>
     <l n="606">They who when profit or resentment call ,</l>
     <l n="607">Heed not the groaning victim they enthrall .</l>
     <l n="608">Then died lamented in the strength of life ,</l>
     <l n="609">A valued MOTHER and a faithful WIFE ;</l>
     <l n="610">Call 'd not away when time had loosed each hold</l>
     <l n="611">On the fond heart , and each desire grew cold ;</l>
     <l n="612">But when , to all that knit us to our kind ,</l>
     <l n="613">She felt fast-bound , as charity can bind ; -</l>
     <l n="614">Not when the ills of age , its pain , its care ,</l>
     <l n="615">The drooping spirit for its fate prepare ;</l>
     <l n="616">And , each affection failing , leaves the heart</l>
     <l n="617">Loosed from life 's charm , and willing to depart ;</l>
     <l n="618">But all her ties the strong invader broke ,</l>
     <l n="619">In all their strength , by one tremendous stroke !</l>
     <l n="620">Sudden and swift the eager pest came on ,</l>
     <l n="621">And terror grew , till every hope was gone ;</l>
     <l n="622">Still those around appear 'd for hope to seek !</l>
     <l n="623">But view 'd the sick and were afraid to speak .</l>
     <l n="624">Slowly they bore , with solemn step , the dead ;</l>
     <l n="625">When grief grew loud and bitter tears were shed ,</l>
     <l n="626">My part began ; a crowd drew near the place ,</l>
     <l n="627">Awe in each eye , alarm in every face :</l>
     <l n="628">So swift the ill , and of so fierce a kind ,</l>
     <l n="629">That fear with pity mingled in each mind ;</l>
     <l n="630">Friends with the husband came their griefs to blend ,</l>
     <l n="631">For good-man Frankford was to all a friend .</l>
     <l n="632">The last-born boy they held above the bier ,</l>
     <l n="633">He knew not grief , but cries express 'd his fear ;</l>
     <l n="634">Each different age and sex reveal 'd its pain ,</l>
     <l n="635">In now a louder , now a lower strain ;</l>
     <l n="636">While the meek father listening to their tones ,</l>
     <l n="637">Swell 'd the full cadence of the grief by groans .</l>
     <l n="638">The elder sister strove her pangs to hide ,</l>
     <l n="639">And soothing words to younger minds applied ’ .</l>
     <l n="640">“ Be still , be patient ; ” oft she strove to stay ;</l>
     <l n="641">But fail 'd as oft , and weeping turn 'd away .</l>
     <l n="642">Curious and sad , upon the fresh-dug hill</l>
     <l n="643">The village lads stood melancholy still ;</l>
     <l n="644">And idle children , wandering to and fro .</l>
     <l n="645">As Nature guided , took the tone of woe .</l>
     <l n="646">Arrived at home , how then they gazed around</l>
     <l n="647">On every place — where she no more was found ; -</l>
     <l n="648">The seat at table she was wont to fill ;</l>
     <l n="649">The fire-side chair , still set , but vacant still ;</l>
     <l n="650">The garden-walks , a labour all her own ;</l>
     <l n="651">The latticed bower , with trailing shrubs o'ergrown ,</l>
     <l n="652">The Sunday-pew she fill 'd with all her race , -</l>
     <l n="653">Each place of hers , was now a sacred place</l>
     <l n="654">That , while it call 'd up sorrows in the eyes ,</l>
     <l n="655">Pierced the full heart and forced them still to rise .</l>
     <l n="656">Oh sacred sorrow ! by whom souls are tried ,</l>
     <l n="657">Sent not to punish mortals , but to guide ;</l>
     <l n="658">If thou art mine ( and who shall proudly dare</l>
     <l n="659">To tell his Maker , he has had a share ! )</l>
     <l n="660">Still let me feel for what thy pangs are sent ,</l>
     <l n="661">And be my guide , and not my punishment !</l>
     <l n="662">Of Leah Cousins next the name appears ,</l>
     <l n="663">With honours crown 'd and blest with length of years ,</l>
     <l n="664">Save that she lived to feel , in life 's decay ,</l>
     <l n="665">The pleasure die , the honours drop away ;</l>
     <l n="666">A matron she , whom every village-wife</l>
     <l n="667">View 'd as the help and guardian of her life ,</l>
     <l n="668">Fathers and sons , indebted to her aid ,</l>
     <l n="669">Respect to her and her profession paid ;</l>
     <l n="670">Who in the house of plenty largely fed ,</l>
     <l n="671">Yet took her station at the pauper 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="672">Nor from that duty could be bribed again ,</l>
     <l n="673">While fear or danger urged her to remain :</l>
     <l n="674">In her experience all her friends relied .</l>
     <l n="675">Heaven was her help and nature was her guide .</l>
     <l n="676">Thus Leah lived ; long trusted , much caress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="677">Till a Town-Dame a youthful farmer bless 'd ;</l>
     <l n="678">A gay vain bride , who would example give</l>
     <l n="679">To that poor village where she deign 'd to live ;</l>
     <l n="680">Some few months past , she sent , in hour of need ,</l>
     <l n="681">For Doctor Glibb , who came with wond'rous speed ,</l>
     <l n="682">Two days he waited , all his art applied ,</l>
     <l n="683">To save the mother when her infant died : -</l>
     <l n="684">“ ‘ Twas well I came , ” at last he deign 'd to say ;</l>
     <l n="685">“ ‘ Twas wondrous well ; ” — and proudly rode away .</l>
     <l n="686">The news ran round ;— “ How vast the Doctor 's pow'r ! ”</l>
     <l n="687">He saved the Lady in the trying hour ;</l>
     <l n="688">Saved her from death , when she was dead to hope ,</l>
     <l n="689">And her fond husband had resign 'd her up :</l>
     <l n="690">So all , like her , may evil fate defy ,</l>
     <l n="691">If Doctor Glibb , with saving hand , be nigh .</l>
     <l n="692">Fame ( now his friend ) , fear , novelty , and whim ,</l>
     <l n="693">And fashion , sent the varying sex to him :</l>
     <l n="694">From this , contention in the village rose ;</l>
     <l n="695">And these the Dame espoused ; the Doctor those ,</l>
     <l n="696">The wealthier part to him and science went ;</l>
     <l n="697">With luck and her the poor remain 'd content .</l>
     <l n="698">The Matron sigh 'd ; for she was vex 'd at heart ,</l>
     <l n="699">With so much profit , so much fame , to part :</l>
     <l n="700">“ So long successful in my art , ” she cried ,</l>
     <l n="701">“ And this proud man , so young and so untried ! ”</l>
     <l n="702">“ Nay , ” said the Doctor , “ dare you trust your wives ,</l>
     <l n="703">The joy , the pride , the solace of your lives ,</l>
     <l n="704">To one who acts and knows no reason why ,</l>
     <l n="705">But trusts , poor hag ! to luck for an ally ? -</l>
     <l n="706">Who , on experience , can her claims advance ,</l>
     <l n="707">And own the powers of accident and chance ?</l>
     <l n="708">A whining dame , who prays in danger 's view ,</l>
     <l n="709">( A proof she knows not what beside to do ;)</l>
     <l n="710">What 's her experience ? In the time that 's gone ,</l>
     <l n="711">Blundering she wrought , and still she blunders on : -</l>
     <l n="712">And what is Nature ? One who acts in aid</l>
     <l n="713">Of gossips half asleep and half afraid :</l>
     <l n="714">With such allies I scorn my fame to blend ,</l>
     <l n="715">Skill is my luck and courage is my friend :</l>
     <l n="716">No slave to Nature , ‘ tis my chief delight</l>
     <l n="717">To win my way and act in her despite : -</l>
     <l n="718">Trust then my art , that , in itself complete ,</l>
     <l n="719">Needs no assistance and fears no defeat . ”</l>
     <l n="720">Warm 'd by her well-spiced ale and aiding pipe ,</l>
     <l n="721">The angry Matron grew for contest ripe .</l>
     <l n="722">“ Can you , ” she said , “ ungrateful and unjust ,</l>
     <l n="723">Before experience , ostentation trust !</l>
     <l n="724">What is your hazard , foolish daughters , tell ?</l>
     <l n="725">If safe , you 're certain ; if secure , you 're well :</l>
     <l n="726">That I have luck must friend and foe confess ,</l>
     <l n="727">And what 's good judgment but a lucky guess ?</l>
     <l n="728">He boasts , but what he can do : — will you run</l>
     <l n="729">From me , your friend ! who , all lie boasts , have done ?</l>
     <l n="730">By proud and learned words his powers are known ;</l>
     <l n="731">By healthy boys and handsome girls my own :</l>
     <l n="732">Wives ! fathers ! children ! by my help you live ;</l>
     <l n="733">Has this pale Doctor more than life to give ?</l>
     <l n="734">No stunted cripple hops the village round ;</l>
     <l n="735">Your hands are active and your heads are sound ;</l>
     <l n="736">My lads are all your fields and flocks require ;</l>
     <l n="737">My lasses all those sturdy lads admire .</l>
     <l n="738">Can this proud leech , with all his boasted skill ,</l>
     <l n="739">Amend the soul or body , wit or will ?</l>
     <l n="740">Does he for courts the sons of farmers frame ,</l>
     <l n="741">Or make the daughter differ from the dame ?</l>
     <l n="742">Or , whom he brings into this world of woe ,</l>
     <l n="743">Prepares he them their part to undergo ?</l>
     <l n="744">If not , this stranger from your doors repel ,</l>
     <l n="745">And be content to BE and to be WELL . ”</l>
     <l n="746">She spake ; but , ah ! with words too strong and plain ;</l>
     <l n="747">Her warmth offended , and her truth was vain :</l>
     <l n="748">The many left her , and the friendly few ,</l>
     <l n="749">If never colder , yet they older grew ;</l>
     <l n="750">Till , unemploy 'd , she felt her spirits droop ,</l>
     <l n="751">And took , insidious aid ! th ’ inspiring cup ;</l>
     <l n="752">Grew poor and peevish as her powers decay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="753">And propp 'd the tottering frame with stronger aid ,</l>
     <l n="754">Then died ! I saw our careful swains convey ,</l>
     <l n="755">From this our changeful world , the Matron 's clay ,</l>
     <l n="756">Who to this world , at least , with equal care ,</l>
     <l n="757">Brought them its changes , good and ill , to share .</l>
     <l n="758">Now to his grave was Roger Cuff conveyed ,</l>
     <l n="759">And strong resentment 's lingering spirit laid .</l>
     <l n="760">Shipwreck 'd in youth , he home return 'd , and found</l>
     <l n="761">His brethren three — and thrice they wish 'd him drown 'd .</l>
     <l n="762">“ Is this a landsman 's love ? Be certain then ,</l>
     <l n="763">“ We part for ever ! ” — and they cried , “ Amen ! ”</l>
     <l n="764">His words were truth 's : -  Some forty summers fled ,</l>
     <l n="765">His brethren died ; his kin supposed him dead :</l>
     <l n="766">Three nephews these , one sprightly niece , and one ,</l>
     <l n="767">Less near in blood — they call 'd him surly John ;</l>
     <l n="768">He work 'd in woods apart from all his kind ,</l>
     <l n="769">Fierce were his looks and moody was his mind .</l>
     <l n="770">For home the sailor now began to sigh : -</l>
     <l n="771">“ The dogs are dead , and I 'll return and die ;</l>
     <l n="772">When all I have , my gains , in years of care ,</l>
     <l n="773">The younger Cuffs with kinder souls shall share -</l>
     <l n="774">Yet hold ! I 'm rich ;— with one consent they 'll say ,</l>
     <l n="775">‘ You 're welcome , Uncle , as the flowers in May . ’</l>
     <l n="776">No ; I 'll disguise me , be in tatters dress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="777">And best befriend the lads who treat me best . ”</l>
     <l n="778">Now all his kindred ,— neither rich nor poor , -</l>
     <l n="779">Kept the wolf want some distance from the door .</l>
     <l n="780">In piteous plight he knock 'd at George 's gate ,</l>
     <l n="781">And begg 'd for aid , as he described his state : -</l>
     <l n="782">But stern was George ;— “ Let them who had thee strong ,</l>
     <l n="783">Help thee to drag thy weaken 'd frame along ;</l>
     <l n="784">To us a stranger , while your limbs would move ,</l>
     <l n="785">From us depart , and try a stranger 's love : -</l>
     <l n="786">“ Ha ! dost thou murmur ? ” — for , in Roger 's throat ,</l>
     <l n="787">Was “ Rascal ! ” rising with disdainful note .</l>
     <l n="788">To pious James he then his prayer address 'd ; -</l>
     <l n="789">“ Good-lack , ” quoth James , “ thy sorrows pierce my breast</l>
     <l n="790">And , had I wealth , as have my brethren twain ,</l>
     <l n="791">One board should feed us and one roof contain :</l>
     <l n="792">But plead I will thy cause , and I will pray :</l>
     <l n="793">And so farewell ! Heaven help thee on thy way ! ”</l>
     <l n="794">“ Scoundrel ! ” said Roger ( but apart ) ;— and told</l>
     <l n="795">His case to Peter ;— Peter too was cold ;</l>
     <l n="796">“ The rates are high ; we have a-many poor ;</l>
     <l n="797">But I will think , ” — he said , and shut the door .</l>
     <l n="798">Then the gay niece the seeming pauper press 'd ; -</l>
     <l n="799">“ Turn , Nancy , turn , and view this form distress 'd :</l>
     <l n="800">Akin to thine is this declining frame ,</l>
     <l n="801">And this poor beggar claims an Uncle 's name . ”</l>
     <l n="802">“ Avaunt ! begone ! ” the courteous maiden said ,</l>
     <l n="803">“ Thou vile impostor ! Uncle Roger 's dead :</l>
     <l n="804">I hate thee , beast ; thy look my spirit shocks ;</l>
     <l n="805">Oh ! that I saw thee starving in the stocks ! ”</l>
     <l n="806">“ My gentle niece ! ” he said — and sought the wood ,</l>
     <l n="807">“ I hunger , fellow ; prithee , give me food ! ”</l>
     <l n="808">“ Give ! am I rich ? This hatchet take , and try</l>
     <l n="809">Thy proper strength , nor give those limbs the lie ;</l>
     <l n="810">Work , feed thyself , to thine own powers appeal ,</l>
     <l n="811">Nor whine out woes thine own right-hand can heal ;</l>
     <l n="812">And while that hand is thine , and thine a leg ,</l>
     <l n="813">Scorn of the proud or of the base to beg . ”</l>
     <l n="814">“ Come , surly John , thy wealthy kinsman view , ”</l>
     <l n="815">Old Roger said ;— “ thy words are brave and true ;</l>
     <l n="816">Come , live with me : we 'll vex those scoundrel-boys ,</l>
     <l n="817">And that prim shrew shall , envying , hear our joys . -</l>
     <l n="818">Tobacco 's glorious fume all day we 'll share ,</l>
     <l n="819">With beef and brandy kill all kinds of care ;</l>
     <l n="820">We 'll beer and biscuit on our table heap ,</l>
     <l n="821">And rail at rascals , till we fall asleep . ”</l>
     <l n="822">Such was their life ; but when the woodman died ,</l>
     <l n="823">His grieving kin for Roger 's smiles applied -</l>
     <l n="824">In vain ; he shut , with stern rebuke , the door ,</l>
     <l n="825">And dying , built a refuge for the poor ,</l>
     <l n="826">With this restriction , That no Cuff should share</l>
     <l n="827">One meal , or shelter for one moment there .</l>
     <l n="828">My Record ends : -  But hark ! e'en now I hear</l>
     <l n="829">The bell of death , and know not whose to fear :</l>
     <l n="830">Our farmers all , and all our hinds were well ;</l>
     <l n="831">In no man 's cottage danger seem 'd to dwell : -</l>
     <l n="832">Yet death of man proclaim these heavy chimes ,</l>
     <l n="833">For thrice they sound , with pausing space , three times ,</l>
     <l n="834">“ Go ; of my Sexton seek , Whose days are sped ? -</l>
     <l n="835">What ! he , himself ! -  and is old Dibble dead ? ”</l>
     <l n="836">His eightieth year he reach 'd , still undecay d ,</l>
     <l n="837">And rectors five to one close vault convey 'd : -</l>
     <l n="838">But he is gone ; his care and skill I lose ,</l>
     <l n="839">And gain a mournful subject for my Muse :</l>
     <l n="840">His masters lost , he 'd oft in turn deplore ,</l>
     <l n="841">And kindly add ,— “ Heaven grant , I lose no more ! ”</l>
     <l n="842">Yet , while he spake , a sly and pleasant glance</l>
     <l n="843">Appear 'd at variance with his complaisance :</l>
     <l n="844">For , as he told their fate and varying worth ,</l>
     <l n="845">He archly look 'd ,— “ I yet may bear thee forth . ”</l>
     <l n="846">“ When first ” — ( he so began ) — “ my trade I plied ,</l>
     <l n="847">Good master Addle was the parish-guide ;</l>
     <l n="848">His clerk and sexton , I beheld with fear ,</l>
     <l n="849">His stride majestic , and his frown severe ;</l>
     <l n="850">A noble pillar of the church he stood ,</l>
     <l n="851">Adorn 'd with college-gown and parish hood :</l>
     <l n="852">Then as he paced the hallow 'd aisles about ,</l>
     <l n="853">He fill 'd the seven-fold surplice fairly out !</l>
     <l n="854">But in his pulpit wearied down with prayer ,</l>
     <l n="855">He sat and seem 'd as in his study 's chair ;</l>
     <l n="856">For while the anthem swell 'd , and when it ceased ,</l>
     <l n="857">Th'expecting people view 'd their slumbering priest ;</l>
     <l n="858">Who , dozing , died .— Our Parson Peele was next ;</l>
     <l n="859">‘ I will not spare you , ’ was his favourite text ;</l>
     <l n="860">Nor did he spare , but raised them many a pound ;</l>
     <l n="861">E'en me he mulct for my poor rood of ground ;</l>
     <l n="862">Yet cared he nought , but with a gibing speech ,</l>
     <l n="863">‘ What should I do , ’ quoth he , ‘ but what I preach ? ’</l>
     <l n="864">His piercing jokes ( and he 'd a plenteous store )</l>
     <l n="865">Were daily offer 'd both to rich and poor ;</l>
     <l n="866">His scorn , his love , in playful words he spoke ;</l>
     <l n="867">His pity , praise , and promise , were a joke :</l>
     <l n="868">But though so young and blest with spirits high ,</l>
     <l n="869">He died as grave as any judge could die :</l>
     <l n="870">The strong attack subdued his lively powers , -</l>
     <l n="871">His was the grave , and Doctor Grandspear ours .</l>
     <l n="872">“ Then were there golden times the village round ;</l>
     <l n="873">In his abundance all appear 'd t'abound ;</l>
     <l n="874">Liberal and rich , a plenteous board he spread ,</l>
     <l n="875">E'en cool Dissenters at his table fed ;</l>
     <l n="876">Who wish 'd and hoped ,— and thought a man so kind</l>
     <l n="877">A way to Heaven , though not their own , might find .</l>
     <l n="878">To them , to all , he was polite and free ,</l>
     <l n="879">Kind to the poor , and , ah ! most kind to me !</l>
     <l n="880">‘ Ralph , ’ would he say , ‘ Ralph Dibble , thou art old ;</l>
     <l n="881">That doublet fit , ‘ twill keep thee from the cold :</l>
     <l n="882">How does my sexton ? -  What ! the times are hard ;</l>
     <l n="883">Drive that stout pig , and pen him in thy yard . ’</l>
     <l n="884">But most , his rev'rence loved a mirthful jest : -</l>
     <l n="885">‘ Thy coat is thin ; why , man , thou'rt BARELY dress 'd</l>
     <l n="886">It 's worn to th ’ thread : but I have nappy beer ;</l>
     <l n="887">Clap that within , and see how they will wear ! ’</l>
     <l n="888">“ Gay days were these ; but they were quickly past :</l>
     <l n="889">When first he came , we found he could n't last :</l>
     <l n="890">A whoreson cough ( and at the fall of leaf )</l>
     <l n="891">Upset him quite ;— but what 's the gain of grief ?</l>
     <l n="892">“ Then came the Author-Rector : his delight</l>
     <l n="893">Was all in books ; to read them or to write :</l>
     <l n="894">Women and men he strove alike to shun ,</l>
     <l n="895">And hurried homeward when his tasks were done ;</l>
     <l n="896">Courteous enough , but careless what he said ,</l>
     <l n="897">For points of learning he reserved his head ;</l>
     <l n="898">And when addressing either poor or rich ,</l>
     <l n="899">He knew no better than his cassock which :</l>
     <l n="900">He , like an osier , was of pliant kind ,</l>
     <l n="901">Erect by nature , but to bend inclined ;</l>
     <l n="902">Not like a creeper falling to the ground ,</l>
     <l n="903">Or meanly catching on the neighbours round :</l>
     <l n="904">Careless was he of surplice , hood , and band , -</l>
     <l n="905">And kindly took them as they came to hand ,</l>
     <l n="906">Nor , like the doctor , wore a world of hat ,</l>
     <l n="907">As if he sought for dignity in that :</l>
     <l n="908">He talk 'd , he gave , but not with cautious rules ;</l>
     <l n="909">Nor turn 'd from gipsies , vagabonds , or fools ;</l>
     <l n="910">It was his nature , but they thought it whim ,</l>
     <l n="911">And so our beaux and beauties turn 'd from him .</l>
     <l n="912">Of questions , much he wrote , profound and dark , -</l>
     <l n="913">How spake the serpent , and where stopp 'd the ark ;</l>
     <l n="914">From what far land the queen of Sheba came ;</l>
     <l n="915">Who Salem 's Priest , and what his father 's name ;</l>
     <l n="916">He made the Song of Songs its mysteries yield ,</l>
     <l n="917">And Revelations to the world reveal 'd .</l>
     <l n="918">He sleeps i ’ the aisle ,— but not a stone records</l>
     <l n="919">His name or fame , his actions or his words :</l>
     <l n="920">And truth , your reverence , when I look around ,</l>
     <l n="921">And mark the tombs in our sepulchral ground</l>
     <l n="922">( Though dare I not of one man 's hope to doubt ) ,</l>
     <l n="923">I 'd join the party who repose without .</l>
     <l n="924">“ Next came a Youth from Cambridge , and in truth</l>
     <l n="925">He was a sober and a comely youth ;</l>
     <l n="926">He blush 'd in meekness as a modest man ,</l>
     <l n="927">And gain 'd attention ere his task began ;</l>
     <l n="928">When preaching , seldom ventured on reproof ,</l>
     <l n="929">But touch 'd his neighbours tenderly enough .</l>
     <l n="930">Him , in his youth , a clamorous sect assail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="931">Advised and censured , flatter 'd ,— and prevail 'd. - </l>
     <l n="932">Then did he much his sober hearers vex ,</l>
     <l n="933">Confound the simple , and the sad perplex ;</l>
     <l n="934">To a new style his reverence rashly took ;</l>
     <l n="935">Loud grew his voice , to threat'ning swell 'd his look ;</l>
     <l n="936">Above , below , on either side , he gazed ,</l>
     <l n="937">Amazing all , and most himself amazed :</l>
     <l n="938">No more he read his preachments pure and plain ,</l>
     <l n="939">But launch 'd outright , and rose and sank again :</l>
     <l n="940">At times he smiled in scorn , at times he wept ,</l>
     <l n="941">And such sad coil with words of vengeance kept ,</l>
     <l n="942">That our blest sleepers started as they slept .</l>
     <l n="943">‘ Conviction comes like light'ning , ’ he would cry ;</l>
     <l n="944">‘ In vain you seek it , and in vain you fly ;</l>
     <l n="945">‘ Tis like the rushing of the mighty wind ,</l>
     <l n="946">Unseen its progress , but its power you find ;</l>
     <l n="947">It strikes the child ere yet its reason wakes ;</l>
     <l n="948">His reason fled , the ancient sire it shakes ;</l>
     <l n="949">The proud , learn 'd man , and him who loves to know</l>
     <l n="950">How and from whence those gusts of grace will blow ,</l>
     <l n="951">It shuns ,— but sinners in their way impedes ,</l>
     <l n="952">And sots and harlots visits in their deeds :</l>
     <l n="953">Of faith and penance it supplies the place ;</l>
     <l n="954">Assures the vilest that they live by grace ,</l>
     <l n="955">And , without running , makes them win the race . ’</l>
     <l n="956">“ Such was the doctrine our young prophet taught ;</l>
     <l n="957">And here conviction , there confusion wrought ;</l>
     <l n="958">When his thin cheek assumed a deadly hue ,</l>
     <l n="959">And all the rose to one small spot withdrew ,</l>
     <l n="960">They call 'd it hectic ; ‘ twas a fiery flush ,</l>
     <l n="961">More fix 'd and deeper than the maiden blush ;</l>
     <l n="962">His paler lips the pearly teeth disclosed ,</l>
     <l n="963">And lab'ring lungs the length'ning speech opposed .</l>
     <l n="964">No more his span-girth shanks and quiv'ring thighs</l>
     <l n="965">Upheld a body of the smaller size ;</l>
     <l n="966">But down he sank upon his dying bed ,</l>
     <l n="967">And gloomy crotchets fill 'd his wandering head .</l>
     <l n="968">‘ Spite of my faith , all-saving faith , ’ he cried ,</l>
     <l n="969">‘ I fear of worldly works the wicked pride ;</l>
     <l n="970">Poor as I am , degraded , abject , blind ,</l>
     <l n="971">The good I 've wrought still rankles in my mind ;</l>
     <l n="972">My alms-deeds all , and every deed I 've done ;</l>
     <l n="973">My moral-rags defile me every one ;</l>
     <l n="974">It should not be : -  what say'st thou ! tell me , Ralph . ’</l>
     <l n="975">Quoth I , ‘ Your reverence , I believe , you 're safe ;</l>
     <l n="976">Your faith 's your prop , nor have you pass 'd such time</l>
     <l n="977">In life 's good-works as swell them to a crime .</l>
     <l n="978">If I of pardon for my sins were sure ,</l>
     <l n="979">About my goodness I would rest secure . ’</l>
     <l n="980">“ Such was his end ; and mine approaches fast ;</l>
     <l n="981">I 've seen my best of preachers ,— and my last , ” -</l>
     <l n="982">He bow 'd , and archly smiled at what he said ,</l>
     <l n="983">Civil but sly : -  “ And is old Dibble dead ? ”</l>
     <l n="984">Yes ; he is gone : and WE are going all ;</l>
     <l n="985">Like flowers we wither , and like leaves we fall ; -</l>
     <l n="986">Here , with an infant , joyful sponsors come ,</l>
     <l n="987">Then bear the new-made Christian to its home :</l>
     <l n="988">A few short years and we behold him stand</l>
     <l n="989">To ask a blessing , with his bride in hand :</l>
     <l n="990">A few , still seeming shorter , and we hear</l>
     <l n="991">His widow weeping at her husband 's bier : -</l>
     <l n="992">Thus , as the months succeed , shall infants take</l>
     <l n="993">Their names ; thus parents shall the child forsake ;</l>
     <l n="994">Thus brides again and bridegrooms blithe shall kneel ,</l>
     <l n="995">By love or law compell 'd their vows to seal ,</l>
