    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Amid the many celebrations last Christmas Eve , in various places by different persons , there was one , in New York City , not like any other anywhere . A company of men , women , and children went together just after the evening service in their church , and , standing around the tomb of the author of “ A Visit from St. Nicholas , ” recited together the words of the poem which we all know so well and love so dearly .</p>
    <p n="2">Dr. Clement C. Moore , who wrote the poem , never expected that he would be remembered by it . If he expected to be famous at all as a writer , he thought it would be because of the Hebrew Dictionary that he wrote .</p>
    <p n="3">He was born in a house near Chelsea Square , New York City , in 1781 ; and he lived there all his life . It was a great big house , with fireplaces in it ;— just the house to be living in on Christmas Eve .</p>
    <p n="4">Dr. Moore had children . He liked writing poetry for them even more than he liked writing a Hebrew Dictionary . He wrote a whole book of poems for them .</p>
    <p n="5">One year he wrote this poem , which we usually call “ ‘ Twas the Night before Christmas , ” to give to his children for a Christmas present . They read it just after they had hung up their stockings before one of the big fireplaces in their house . Afterward , they learned it , and sometimes recited it , just as other children learn it and recite it now .</p>

    <docImprint>It was printed in a newspaper . Then a magazine printed it , and after a time it was printed in the school readers . Later it was printed by itself , with pictures . Then it was translated into German , French , and many other languages . It was even made into “ Braille ” ; which is the raised printing that blind children read with their fingers . But never has it been given to us in so attractive a form as in this book . It has happened that almost all the children in the world know this poem . How few of them know any Hebrew ! Every Christmas Eve the young men studying to be ministers at the General Theological Seminary ,<settlement>New York</settlement>City , put a holly wreath around Dr. Moore 's picture , which is on the wall of their dining-room . Why ? Because he gave the ground on which the General Theological Seminary stands ? Because he wrote a Hebrew Dictionary ? No . They do it because he was the author of “ A Visit from St. Nicholas . ” Most of the children probably know the words of the poem . They are old . But the pictures that Miss Jessie Willcox Smith has painted for this edition of it are new . All the children , probably , have seen other pictures painted by Miss Smith , showing children at other seasons of the year . How much they will enjoy looking at these pictures , showing children on that night that all children like best ,— Christmas Eve !</docImprint>

     <l n="2">Not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse ;</l>

     <l n="4">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there ;</l>

     <l n="6">The children were nestled all snug in their beds ,</l>
     <l n="7">While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ;</l>

     <l n="11">When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter ,</l>
     <l n="12">I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter .</l>
     <l n="13">Away to the window I flew like a flash ,</l>

     <l n="23">More rapid than eagles his coursers they came ,</l>
     <l n="24">And he whistled , and shouted , and called them by name :</l>
