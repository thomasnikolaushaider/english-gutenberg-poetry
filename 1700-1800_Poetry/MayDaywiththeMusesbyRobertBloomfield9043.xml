    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">I am of opinion that Prefaces are very useless things in cases like the present , where the Author must talk of himself , with little amusement to his readers . I have hesitated whether I should say any thing or nothing ; but as it is the fashion to say something , I suppose I must comply . I am well aware that many readers will exclaim — “ It is not the common practice of English baronets to remit half a year 's rent to their tenants for poetry , or for any thing else . ” This may be very true ; but I have found a character in the Rambler , No . 82 , who made a very different bargain , and who says , “ And as Alfred received the tribute of the Welsh in wolves ’ heads , I allowed my tenants to pay their rents in butterflies , till I had exhausted the papilionaceous tribe . I then directed them to the pursuit of other animals , and obtained , by this easy method , most of the grubs and insects which land , air , or water can supply ......... I have , from my own ground , the longest blade of grass upon record , and once accepted , as a half year 's rent for a field of wheat , an ear , containing more grains than had been seen before upon a single stem . ”</p>
    <p n="2">I hope my old Sir Ambrose stands in no need of defence from me or from any one ; a man has a right to do what he likes with his own estate . The characters I have introduced as candidates may not come off so easily ; a cluster of poets is not likely to be found in one village , and the following lines , written by my good friend T. Park . Esq . of Hampstead , are not only true , but beautifully true , and I cannot omit them .</p>
    <p n="3">WRITTEN IN THE ISLE OF THANET ,</p>
    <p n="4">August , 1790 .</p>
    <p n="5">The bard , who paints from rural plains , Must oft himself the void supply Of damsels pure and artless swains , Of innocence and industry :</p>
    <p n="6">For sad experience shows the heart Of human beings much the same ; Or polish 'd by insidious art , Or rude as from the clod it came .</p>
    <p n="7">And he who roams the village round , Or strays amid the harvest sere , Will hear , as now , too many a sound Quiet would never wish to hear .</p>
    <p n="8">The wrangling rustics ’ loud abuse , The coarse , unfeeling , witless jest , The threat obscene , the oath profuse , And all that cultured minds detest .</p>
    <p n="9">Hence let those Sylvan poets glean , Who picture life without a flaw ; Nature may form a perfect scene , But Fancy must the figures draw .</p>
    <p n="10">The word “ fancy ” connects itself with my very childhood , fifty years back . The fancy of those who wrote the songs which I was obliged to hear in infancy was a very inanimate and sleepy fancy . I could enumerate a dozen songs at least which all described sleeping shepherds and shepherdesses , and , in one instance , where they both went to sleep : this is not fair certainly ; it is not even “ watch and watch . ”</p>
    <p n="11">“ As Damon and Phillis were keeping of sheep , Being free from all care they retired to sleep , ” &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="12">I must say , that if I understand any thing at all about keeping sheep , this is not the way to go to work with them . But such characters and such writings were fashionable , and fashion will beat common sense at any time .</p>
    <p n="13">With all the beauty and spirit of Cunningham 's “ Kate of Aberdeen , ” and some others , I never found any thing to strike my mind so forcibly as the last stanza of Dibdin 's “ Sailor 's Journal ” —</p>
   </div>

    <docImprint>“ At length , ‘ twas in the month of May , Our crew , it being lovely weather , At three A. M. discovered day And<country>England</country>'s chalky cliffs together ! At seven , up channel how we bore , Whilst hopes and fears rush 'd o'er each fancy ! At twelve , I gaily jump 'd on shore , And to my throbbing heart press 'd Nancy . ” This , to my feelings , is a balm at all times ; it is spirit , animation , and imagery , all at once . I will plead no excuses for any thing which the reader may find in this little volume , but merely state , that I once met with a lady in<settlement>London</settlement>, who , though otherwise of strong mind and good information , would maintain that “ it is impossible for a blind man to fall in love . ” I always thought her wrong , and the present tale of “ Alfred and Jennet ” is written to elucidate my side of the question . I have been reported to be dead ; but I can assure the reader that this , like many other reports , is not true . I have written these tales in anxiety , and in a wretched state of health ; and if these formidable foes have not incapacitated me , but left me free to meet the public eye with any degree of credit , that degree of credit I am sure I shall gain . I am , with remembrance of what is past , Most respectfully ,</docImprint>

    <head>THE INVITATION</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">O for the strength to paint my joy once more !</l>
     <l n="2">That joy I feel when Winter 's reign is o'er ;</l>
     <l n="3">When the dark despot lifts his hoary brow ,</l>
     <l n="4">And seeks his polar-realm 's eternal snow .</l>
     <l n="5">Though black November 's fogs oppress my brain ,</l>
     <l n="6">Shake every nerve , and struggling fancy chain ;</l>
     <l n="7">Though time creeps o'er me with his palsied hand ,</l>
     <l n="8">And frost-like bids the stream of passion stand ,</l>
     <l n="9">And through his dry teeth sends a shivering blast ,</l>
     <l n="10">And points to more than fifty winters past ,</l>
     <l n="11">Why should I droop with heartless , aimless eye ?</l>
     <l n="12">Friends start around , and all my phantoms fly ,</l>
     <l n="13">And Hope , upsoaring with expanded wing ,</l>
     <l n="14">Unfolds a scroll , inscribed “ Remember Spring . ”</l>
     <l n="15">Stay , sweet enchantress , charmer of my days ,</l>
     <l n="16">And glance thy rainbow colours o'er my lays ;</l>
     <l n="17">Be to poor Giles what thou hast ever been ,</l>
     <l n="18">His heart 's warm solace and his sovereign queen ;</l>
     <l n="19">Dance with his rustics when the laugh runs high ,</l>
     <l n="20">Live in the lover 's heart , the maiden 's eye ;</l>
     <l n="21">Still be propitious when his feet shall stray</l>
     <l n="22">Beneath the bursting hawthorn-buds of May ;</l>
     <l n="23">Warm every thought , and brighten every hour ,</l>
     <l n="24">And let him feel thy presence and thy power .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">SIR AMBROSE HIGHAM , in his eightieth year ,</l>
     <l n="26">With memory unimpair 'd , and conscience clear ,</l>
     <l n="27">His English heart untrammell 'd , and full blown</l>
     <l n="28">His senatorial honours and renown ,</l>
     <l n="29">Now , basking in his plenitude of fame ,</l>
     <l n="30">Resolved , in concert with his noble dame ,</l>
     <l n="31">To drive to town no more — no more by night</l>
     <l n="32">To meet in crowded courts a blaze of light ,</l>
     <l n="33">In streets a roaring mob with flags unfurl 'd ,</l>
     <l n="34">And all the senseless discord of the world ,—</l>
     <l n="35">But calmly wait the hour of his decay ,</l>
     <l n="36">The broad bright sunset of his glorious day ;</l>
     <l n="37">And where he first drew breath at last to fall ,</l>
     <l n="38">Beneath the towering shades of Oakly Hall [ A ] .</l>
    </lg>

<note>Footnote A : The seat of Sir Ambrose is situated in the author 's imagination only ; the reader must build Oakly Hall where he pleases .</note>   <note xml:id="noteA" place="bottom" n="A">The seat of Sir Ambrose is situated in the author 's imagination only ; the reader must build Oakly Hall where he pleases .</note>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Quick spread the news through hamlet , field , and farm ,</l>
     <l n="2">The labourer wiped his brow and staid his arm ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Twas news to him of more importance far</l>
     <l n="4">Than change of empires or the yells of war ;</l>
     <l n="5">It breathed a hope which nothing could destroy ,</l>
     <l n="6">Poor widows rose , and clapp 'd their hands for joy ,</l>
     <l n="7">Glad voices rang at every cottage door ,</l>
     <l n="8">“ Good old Sir Ambrose goes to town no more . ”</l>
     <l n="9">Well might the village bells the triumph sound ,</l>
     <l n="10">Well might the voice of gladness ring around ;</l>
     <l n="11">Where sickness raged , or want allied to shame ,</l>
     <l n="12">Sure as the sun his well-timed succour came ;</l>
     <l n="13">Food for the starving child , and warmth and wine</l>
     <l n="14">For age that totter 'd in its last decline .</l>
     <l n="15">From him they shared the embers ’ social glow ;</l>
     <l n="16">He fed the flame that glanced along the snow ,</l>
     <l n="17">When winter drove his storms across the sky ,</l>
     <l n="18">And pierced the bones of shrinking poverty .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="19">Sir Ambrose loved the Muses , and would pay</l>
     <l n="20">Due honours even to the ploughman 's lay ;</l>
     <l n="21">Would cheer the feebler bard , and with the strong</l>
     <l n="22">Soar to the noblest energies of song ;</l>
     <l n="23">Catch the rib-shaking laugh , or from his eye</l>
     <l n="24">Dash silently the tear of sympathy .</l>
     <l n="25">Happy old man !— with feelings such as these</l>
     <l n="26">The seasons all can charm , and trifles please ;</l>
     <l n="27">And hence a sudden thought , a new-born whim ,</l>
     <l n="28">Would shake his cup of pleasure to the brim ,</l>
     <l n="29">Turn scoffs and doubts and obstacles aside ,</l>
     <l n="30">And instant action follow like a tide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="31">Time past , he had on his paternal ground</l>
     <l n="32">With pride the latent sparks of genius found</l>
     <l n="33">In many a local ballad , many a tale ,</l>
     <l n="34">As wild and brief as cowslips in the dale ,</l>
     <l n="35">Though unrecorded as the gleams of light</l>
     <l n="36">That vanish in the quietness of night</l>
     <l n="37">“ Why not , ” he cried , as from his couch he rose ,</l>
     <l n="38">“ To cheer my age , and sweeten my repose ,</l>
     <l n="39">“ Why not be just and generous in time ,</l>
     <l n="40">“ And bid my tenants pay their rents in rhyme ?</l>
     <l n="41">“ For one half year they shall .— A feast shall bring</l>
     <l n="42">“ A crowd of merry faces in the spring ;—</l>
     <l n="43">“ Here , pens , boy , pens ; I 'll weigh the case no more ,</l>
     <l n="44">“ But write the summons :— go , go , shut the door .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="45">“ ‘ All ye on Oakly manor dwelling ,</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Farming , labouring , buying , selling ,</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Neighbours ! banish gloomy looks ,</l>
     <l n="48">‘ My grey old steward shuts his books .</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Let not a thought of winter 's rent</l>
     <l n="50">‘ Destroy one evening 's merriment ;</l>
     <l n="51">‘ I ask not gold , but tribute found</l>
     <l n="52">‘ Abundant on Parnassian ground .</l>
     <l n="53">‘ Choose , ye who boast the gift , your themes</l>
     <l n="54">‘ Of joy or pathos , tales or dreams ,</l>

     <l n="57">‘ Fairies , indeed , may wind their way ,</l>
     <l n="58">‘ And sparkle through the brightest lay :</l>
     <l n="59">‘ I love their pranks , their favourite green ,</l>
     <l n="60">‘ And , could the little sprites be seen ,</l>
     <l n="61">‘ Were I a king , I 'd sport with them ,</l>
     <l n="62">‘ And dance beneath my diadem .</l>
     <l n="63">‘ But surely fancy need not brood</l>
     <l n="64">‘ O'er midnight darkness , crimes , and blood ,</l>
     <l n="65">‘ In magic cave or monk 's retreat ,</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Whilst the bright world is at her feet ;</l>
     <l n="67">‘ Whilst to her boundless range is given ,</l>
     <l n="68">‘ By night , by day , the lights of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="69">‘ And all they shine upon ; whilst Love</l>
     <l n="70">‘ Still reigns the monarch of the grove ,</l>
     <l n="71">‘ And real life before her lies</l>
     <l n="72">‘ In all its thousand , thousand dies .</l>
     <l n="73">‘ Then bring me nature , bring me sense ,</l>
     <l n="74">‘ And joy shall be your recompense :</l>
     <l n="75">‘ On Old May-day I hope to see</l>
     <l n="76">‘ All happy :— leave the rest to me .</l>
     <l n="77">‘ A general feast shall cheer us all</l>
     <l n="78">‘ Upon the lawn that fronts the hall ,</l>
     <l n="79">‘ With tents for shelter , laurel boughs</l>
     <l n="80">‘ And wreaths of every flower that blows .</l>
     <l n="81">‘ The months are wending fast away ;</l>
     <l n="82">‘ Farewell ,— remember Old May-day . ’ ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="83">Surprise , and mirth , and gratitude , and jeers ,</l>
     <l n="84">The clown 's broad wonder , th ’ enthusiast 's tears ,</l>
     <l n="85">Fresh gleams of comfort on the brow of care ,</l>
     <l n="86">The sectary 's cold shrug , the miser 's stare ,</l>
     <l n="87">Were all excited , for the tidings flew</l>
     <l n="88">As quick as scandal the whole country through .</l>
     <l n="89">“ Rent paid by rhymes at Oakly may be great ,</l>
     <l n="90">“ But rhymes for taxes would appal the state , ”</l>
     <l n="91">Exclaim 'd th ’ exciseman ,— “ and then tithes , alas !</l>
     <l n="92">“ Why there , again , ‘ twill never come to pass . ” —</l>
     <l n="93">Thus all still ventured , as the whim inclined ,</l>
     <l n="94">Remarks as various as the varying mind :</l>
     <l n="95">For here Sir Ambrose sent a challenge forth ,</l>
     <l n="96">That claim 'd a tribute due to sterling worth ;</l>
     <l n="97">And all , whatever might their host regale ,</l>
     <l n="98">Agreed to share the feast and drink his ale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="99">Now shot through many a heart a secret fire ,</l>
     <l n="100">A new born spirit , an intense desire</l>
     <l n="101">For once to catch a spark of local fame ,</l>
     <l n="102">And bear a poet 's honourable name !</l>
     <l n="103">Already some aloft began to soar ,</l>
     <l n="104">And some to think who never thought before ;</l>
     <l n="105">But O , what numbers all their strength applied ,</l>
     <l n="106">Then threw despairingly the task aside</l>
     <l n="107">With feign 'd contempt , and vow 'd they 'd never tried .</l>
     <l n="108">Did dairy-wife neglect to turn her cheese ,</l>
     <l n="109">Or idling miller lose the favouring breeze ;</l>
     <l n="110">Did the young ploughman o'er the furrows stand ,</l>
     <l n="111">Or stalking sower swing an empty hand ,</l>
     <l n="112">One common sentence on their heads would fall ,</l>
     <l n="113">‘ Twas Oakly banquet had bewitch 'd them all .</l>
     <l n="114">Loud roar 'd the winds of March , with whirling snow ,</l>
     <l n="115">One brightening hour an April breeze would blow ;</l>
     <l n="116">Now hail , now hoar-frost bent the flow'ret ' s head ,</l>
     <l n="117">Now struggling beams their languid influence shed ,</l>
     <l n="118">That scarce a cowering bird yet dared to sing</l>
     <l n="119">‘ Midst the wild changes of our island spring .</l>
     <l n="120">Yet , shall the Italian goatherd boasting cry ,</l>
     <l n="121">“ Poor Albion ! when hadst thou so clear a sky ! ”</l>
     <l n="122">And deem that nature smiles for him alone ;</l>
     <l n="123">Her renovated beauties all his own ?</l>
     <l n="124">No :— let our April showers by night descend ,</l>
     <l n="125">Noon 's genial warmth with twilight stillness blend ;</l>
     <l n="126">The broad Atlantic pour her pregnant breath ,</l>
     <l n="127">And rouse the vegetable world from death ;</l>
     <l n="128">Our island spring is rapture 's self to me ,</l>
     <l n="129">All I have seen , and all I wish to see .</l>

     <l n="130">Thus came the jovial day , no streaks of red</l>
     <l n="131">O'er the broad portal of the morn were spread ,</l>
     <l n="132">But one high-sailing mist of dazzling white ,</l>
     <l n="133">A screen of gossamer , a magic light ,</l>
     <l n="134">Doom 'd instantly , by simplest shepherd 's ken ,</l>
     <l n="135">To reign awhile , and be exhaled at ten .</l>
     <l n="136">O'er leaves , o'er blossoms , by his power restored ,</l>
     <l n="137">Forth came the conquering sun and look 'd abroad ;</l>
     <l n="138">Millions of dew-drops fell , yet millions hung ,</l>
     <l n="139">Like words of transport trembling on the tongue</l>
     <l n="140">Too strong for utt'rance :— Thus the infant boy ,</l>
     <l n="141">With rosebud cheeks , and features tuned to joy ,</l>
     <l n="142">Weeps while he struggles with restraint or pain ,</l>
     <l n="143">But change the scene , and make him laugh again ,</l>
     <l n="144">His heart rekindles , and his cheek appears</l>
     <l n="145">A thousand times more lovely through his tears .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="146">From the first glimpse of day a busy scene</l>

     <l n="149">The mansion 's ornament , the hamlet 's pride ;</l>

     <l n="153">But light is labour where the task is new .</l>
     <l n="154">Some wheel 'd the turf to build a grassy throne</l>
     <l n="155">Round a huge thorn that spread his boughs alone ,</l>
     <l n="156">Rough-rined and bold , as master of the place ;</l>
     <l n="157">Five generations of the Higham race</l>
     <l n="158">Had pluck 'd his flowers , and still he held his sway ,</l>

     <l n="29">Then gently , singly , down , down , down , they went ,</l>
     <l n="30">And told of twenty years that I had spent</l>

     <l n="35">And seem 'd to say ( past friendship to renew )</l>
     <l n="36">“ Ah ha ! old worn-out soldier , is it you ? ”</l>
     <l n="37">Through the room ranged the imprison 'd humble bee ,</l>
     <l n="38">And bomb 'd , and bounced , and straggled to be free ,</l>
     <l n="39">Dashing against the panes with sullen roar ,</l>

     <l n="44">That met us as we pass 'd the Cape of Storms ,</l>

     <l n="63">I raved at war and all its horrid cost ,</l>
     <l n="64">And glory 's quagmire , where the brave are lost .</l>

     <l n="1">Yes , let me tell of Jennet , my last child ;</l>
     <l n="2">In her the charms of all the rest ran wild ,</l>
     <l n="3">And sprouted as they pleased . Still by my side ,</l>
     <l n="4">I own she was my favourite , was my pride ,</l>
     <l n="5">Since first she labour 'd round my neck to twine ,</l>
     <l n="6">Or clasp 'd both little hands in one of mine :</l>
     <l n="7">And when the season broke , I 've seen her bring</l>
     <l n="8">Lapfuls of flowers , and then the girl would sing</l>
     <l n="9">Whole songs , and halves , and bits , O , with such glee !</l>
     <l n="10">If playmates found a favourite , it was she .</l>
     <l n="11">Her lively spirit lifted her to joy ;</l>
     <l n="12">To distance in the race a clumsy boy</l>
     <l n="13">Would raise the flush of conquest in her eye ,</l>
     <l n="14">And all was dance , and laugh , and liberty .</l>
     <l n="15">Yet not hard-hearted , take me right , I beg ,</l>
     <l n="16">The veriest romp that ever wagg 'd a leg</l>
     <l n="17">Was Jennet ; but when pity soothed her mind ,</l>
     <l n="18">Prompt with her tears , and delicately kind .</l>
     <l n="19">The half-fledged nestling , rabbit , mouse , or dove ,</l>
     <l n="20">By turns engaged her cares and infant love ;</l>
     <l n="21">And many a one , at the last doubtful strife ,</l>
     <l n="22">Warm 'd in her bosom , started into life .</l>

     <l n="23">At thirteen she was all that Heaven could send ,</l>
     <l n="24">My nurse , my faithful clerk , my lively friend ;</l>
     <l n="25">Last at my pillow when I sunk to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="26">First on my threshold soon as day could peep :</l>
     <l n="27">I heard her happy to her heart 's desire ,</l>
     <l n="28">With clanking pattens , and a roaring fire .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="29">Then , having store of new-laid eggs to spare ,</l>
     <l n="30">She fill 'd her basket with the simple fare ,</l>
     <l n="31">And weekly trudged ( I think I see her still )</l>
     <l n="32">To sell them at yon house upon the hill .</l>
     <l n="33">Oft have I watch 'd her as she stroll 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="34">Heard the gate bang , and heard her morning song ;</l>
     <l n="35">And , as my warm ungovern 'd feelings rose ,</l>
     <l n="36">Said to myself , “ Heaven bless her ! there she goes . ”</l>
     <l n="37">Long would she tarry , and then dancing home ,</l>
     <l n="38">Tell how the lady bade her oft'ner come ,</l>
     <l n="39">And bade her talk and laugh without control ;</l>
     <l n="40">For Jennet 's voice was music to the soul ,</l>
     <l n="41">My tale shall prove it :— For there dwelt a son ,</l>
     <l n="42">An only child , and where there is but one ,</l>
     <l n="43">Indulgence like a mildew reigns , from whence</l>
     <l n="44">Mischief may follow if that child wants sense .</l>
     <l n="45">But Alfred was a youth of noble mind ,</l>
     <l n="46">With ardent passions , and with taste refined ;</l>
     <l n="47">All that could please still courted heart and hand ,</l>
     <l n="48">Music , joy , peace , and wealth , at his command ;</l>
     <l n="49">Wealth , which his widow 'd mother deem 'd his own ;</l>
     <l n="50">Except the poor , she lived for him alone .</l>
     <l n="51">Yet would she weep by stealth when he was near ,</l>
     <l n="52">But check 'd all sighs to spare his wounded ear ;</l>
     <l n="53">For from his cradle he had never seen</l>
     <l n="54">Soul-cheering sunbeams , or wild nature 's green .</l>
     <l n="55">But all life 's blessings centre not in sight ;</l>
     <l n="56">For Providence , that dealt him one long night ,</l>
     <l n="57">Had given , in pity to the blooming boy ,</l>
     <l n="58">Feelings more exquisitely tuned to joy .</l>
     <l n="59">Fond to excess was he of all that grew ;</l>
     <l n="60">The morning blossom sprinkled o'er with dew ,</l>
     <l n="61">Across his path , as if in playful freak ,</l>
     <l n="62">Would dash his brow , and weep upon his cheek ;</l>
     <l n="63">Each varying leaf that brush 'd where'er he came ,</l>
     <l n="64">Press 'd to his rosy lip he call 'd by name ;</l>
     <l n="65">He grasp 'd the saplings , measured every bough ,</l>
     <l n="66">Inhaled the fragrance that the spring months throw</l>
     <l n="67">Profusely round , till his young heart confess 'd</l>
     <l n="68">That all was beauty , and himself was bless 'd .</l>
     <l n="69">Yet when he traced the wide extended plain ,</l>
     <l n="70">Or clear brook side , he felt a transient pain ;</l>
     <l n="71">The keen regret of goodness , void of pride ,</l>
     <l n="72">To think he could not roam without a guide .</l>
    </lg>

     <l n="73">Who , guess ye , knew these scenes of home delight</l>
     <l n="74">Better than Jennet , bless 'd with health and sight ?</l>
     <l n="75">Whene'er she came , he from his sports would slide ,</l>
     <l n="76">And catch her wild laugh , listening by her side ;</l>
     <l n="77">Mount to the tell-tale clock with ardent spring ,</l>
     <l n="78">And feel the passing hour , then fondly cling</l>
     <l n="79">To Jennet 's arm , and tell how sweet the breath</l>
     <l n="80">Of bright May-mornings on the open heath ;</l>
     <l n="81">Then off they started , rambling far and wide ,</l>

     <l n="127">Then down he sat , sought out a tender strain ,</l>
     <l n="128">Sung the first words , then struck the chords again ;</l>
     <l n="129">“ Come , Jennet , help me , you must know this song</l>
     <l n="130">“ Which I have sung , and you have heard so long . ”</l>
     <l n="131">I mark 'd the palpitation of her heart ,</l>
     <l n="132">Yet she complied , and strove to take a part ,</l>
     <l n="133">But faint and fluttering , swelling by degrees ,</l>
     <l n="134">Ere self-composure gave that perfect ease ,</l>
     <l n="135">The soul of song :— then , with triumphant glee ,</l>
     <l n="136">Resting her idle work upon her knee ,</l>
     <l n="137">Her little tongue soon fill 'd the room around</l>
     <l n="138">With such a voluble and magic sound ,</l>
     <l n="139">That , ‘ spite of all her pains to persevere ,</l>
     <l n="140">She stopp 'd to sigh , and wipe a starting tear ;</l>
     <l n="141">Then roused herself for faults to make amends .</l>
     <l n="142">While Alfred trembled to his fingers ’ ends .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="143">But when this storm of feeling sunk to rest ,</l>
     <l n="144">Jennet , resuming , sung her very best ,</l>
     <l n="145">And on the ear , with many a dying fall ,</l>
     <l n="146">She pour 'd th ’ enchanting “ Harp of Tara 's Hall . ”</l>
     <l n="147">Still Alfred hid his raptures from her view ,</l>
     <l n="148">Still touch 'd the keys , those raptures to renew ,</l>
     <l n="149">And led her on to that sweet past'ral air ,</l>
     <l n="150">The Highland Laddie with the yellow hair .</l>
     <l n="151">She caught the sound , and with the utmost ease</l>
     <l n="152">Bade nature 's music triumph , sure to please :</l>
     <l n="153">Such truth , such warmth , such tenderness express 'd ,</l>
     <l n="154">That my old heart was dancing in my breast .</l>
     <l n="155">Upsprung the youth , “ O Jennet , where 's your hand ?</l>
     <l n="156">“ There 's not another girl in all the land ,</l>
     <l n="157">“ If she could bring me empires , bring me sight ,</l>

     <l n="159">“ You little baggage ! not to tell before</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="161">Thus I have seen her from my own fire-side</l>
     <l n="162">Attain the utmost summit of her pride ;</l>

     <l n="164">At the great house my Jennet might be found ,</l>
     <l n="165">And , while I watch 'd her progress with delight ,</l>
     <l n="166">She had a father 's blessing every night ,</l>
     <l n="167">And grew in knowledge at that moral school</l>
     <l n="168">Till I began to guess myself a fool .</l>
     <l n="169">Music ! why she could play as well as he !</l>
     <l n="170">At least I thought so ,— but we 'll let that be :</l>
     <l n="171">She read the poets , grave and light , by turns ,</l>
     <l n="172">And talk 'd of Cowper 's “ Task , ” and Robin Burns ;</l>
     <l n="173">Nay , read without a book , as I may say ,</l>
     <l n="174">As much as some could with in half a day .</l>
     <l n="175">‘ Twas thus I found they pass 'd their happy time ,</l>

     <l n="177">Spread forth her scents and hues , and whisper 'd love</l>
     <l n="178">And joy to every bird in every grove ;</l>
     <l n="179">And though their colours could not meet his eye ,</l>
     <l n="180">She pluck 'd him flowers , then talk 'd of poetry .</l>

     <l n="181">Once on a sunbright morning , ‘ twas in June ,</l>
     <l n="182">I felt my spirits and my hopes in tune ,</l>
     <l n="183">And idly rambled forth , as if t ’ explore</l>
     <l n="184">The little valley just before my door ;</l>
     <l n="185">Down by yon dark green oak I found a seat</l>
     <l n="186">Beneath the clustering thorns , a snug retreat</l>
     <l n="187">For poets , as I deem 'd , who often prize</l>
     <l n="188">Such holes and corners far from human eyes ;</l>
     <l n="189">I mark 'd young Alfred , led by Jennet , stray</l>

     <l n="191">They came behind me , I was still unseen ;</l>
     <l n="192">He was the elder , Jennet was sixteen .</l>
     <l n="193">My heart misgave me , lest I should be deem 'd</l>
     <l n="194">A prying listener , never much esteem 'd ,</l>

     <l n="200">“ O , thank you , Jennet , ” said the generous boy .</l>
     <l n="201">Much was their talk , which many a theme supplied ,</l>

     <l n="206">A little tremulous , a little shy ,</l>
     <l n="207">But , with the tenderest accents , ask 'd his guide</l>
     <l n="208">A question which might touch both love and pride .</l>
     <l n="209">“ This morning , Jennet , why did you delay ,</l>

     <l n="272">But in the garden bower spent half the day .</l>
     <l n="273">By starts he sung , then wildest trillings made ,</l>

     <l n="275">I turn 'd a corner and approach 'd the pair ;</l>

     <l n="284">‘ Midst her old friends , my poultry , and my flowers .</l>
     <l n="285">She came ,— but not till fatal news had wrung</l>
     <l n="286">Her heart through sleepless hours , and chain 'd her tongue .</l>
     <l n="287">She came , but with a look that gave me pain ,</l>
     <l n="288">For , though bright sunbeams sparkled after rain ,</l>
     <l n="289">Though every brood came round , half run , half fly ,</l>
     <l n="290">I knew her anguish by her alter 'd eye ;</l>

     <l n="292">To soothe her grief , yet gave it not a name .</l>
     <l n="293">At length a few sad bitter tears she shed .</l>
     <l n="294">And on both hands reclined her aching head .</l>
     <l n="295">‘ Twas then my time the conqueror to prove ,</l>
     <l n="296">I summon 'd all my rhetoric , all my love .</l>

     <l n="307">With soften 'd tone I mention 'd Alfred 's name ,</l>

     <l n="405">We did not promise that this motley throng</l>
     <l n="406">Should every one supply a votive song ;</l>
     <l n="407">Nor every tenant :— yet thou hast been kind ,</l>
     <l n="408">For untold tales must still remain behind ,</l>
     <l n="409">Which might o'er listening patience still prevail .</l>
     <l n="410">Did fancy waver not , nor daylight fail .</l>
     <l n="411">“ The Soldier 's Wife , ” her toils , his battles o'er ,</l>
     <l n="412">“ Love in a Shower , ” the riv'let ' s sudden roar ;</l>
     <l n="413">Then , “ Lines to Aggravation ” form the close ,</l>
     <l n="414">Parent of murders , and the worst of woes .</l>
     <l n="415">But while the changeful hours of daylight flew ,</l>
     <l n="416">Some homeward look 'd , and talk 'd of evening dew ;</l>
     <l n="417">Some watch 'd the sun 's decline , and stroll 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="418">Some wish 'd another dance , and partners found ;</l>
     <l n="419">When in an instant every eye was drawn</l>
     <l n="420">To one bright object on the upper lawn ;</l>
     <l n="421">A fair procession from the mansion came ,</l>
     <l n="422">Unknown its purport , and unknown its aim .</l>
     <l n="423">No gazer could refrain , no tongue could cease ,</l>
     <l n="424">It seem 'd an embassy of love and peace .</l>
     <l n="425">Nearer and nearer still approach 'd the train ,</l>
     <l n="426">Age in the van transform 'd to youth again .</l>
     <l n="427">Sir Ambrose gazed , and scarce believed his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="428">‘ Twas magic , memory , love , and blank surprise ,</l>
     <l n="429">For there his venerable lady wore</l>
     <l n="430">The very dress which , sixty years before ,</l>
     <l n="431">Had sparkled on her sunshine bridal morn ,</l>
     <l n="432">Had sparkled , ay , beneath this very thorn !</l>
     <l n="433">Her hair was snowy white , o'er which was seen ,</l>
     <l n="434">Emblem of what her bridal cheeks had been ,</l>
     <l n="435">A twin red rose — no other ornament</l>
     <l n="436">Had pride suggested , or false feeling lent ;</l>
     <l n="437">She came to grace the triumph of her lord ,</l>
     <l n="438">And pay him honours at his festive board .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="18">
     <l n="439">Nine ruddy lasses follow 'd where she stepp 'd ;</l>
     <l n="440">White were their virgin robes , that lightly swept</l>
     <l n="441">The downy grass ; in every laughing eye</l>
     <l n="442">Cupid had skulk 'd , and written “ victory . ”</l>
     <l n="443">What heart on earth its homage could refuse ?</l>
     <l n="444">Each tripp 'd , unconsciously , a blushing Muse .</l>
     <l n="445">A slender chaplet of fresh blossoms bound</l>
     <l n="446">Their clustering ringlets in a magic round .</l>
     <l n="447">And , as they slowly moved across the green ,</l>
     <l n="448">Each in her beauty seem 'd a May-day queen .</l>
     <l n="449">The first a wreath bore in her outstretch 'd hand ,</l>
     <l n="450">The rest a single rose upon a wand ;</l>
     <l n="451">Their steps were measured to that grassy throne</l>
     <l n="452">Where , watching them , Sir Ambrose sat alone .</l>
     <l n="453">They stopp 'd ,— when she , the foremost of the row ,</l>
     <l n="454">Curtsied , and placed the wreath upon his brow ;</l>
     <l n="455">The rest , in order pacing by his bower ,</l>
     <l n="456">In the loop 'd wreath left each her single flower ,—</l>
     <l n="457">Then stood aside .— What broke the scene 's repose ?</l>
     <l n="458">The whole assembly clapp 'd their hands and rose .</l>

     <l n="459">The Muses charm 'd them as they form 'd a ring ,</l>

     <l n="462">Her love so perfect , and her truth so tried .</l>
     <l n="463">Oh , sweet it is to hear , to see , to name ,</l>
     <l n="464">Unquench 'd affection in the palsied frame —</l>
     <l n="465">To think upon the boundless raptures past ,</l>
     <l n="466">And love , triumphant , conquering to the last !</l>

     <l n="467">Silenced by feeling , vanquish 'd by his tears ,</l>

     <l n="471">Till , by one last and vigorous essay ,</l>
     <l n="472">His tide of feeling roll 'd itself away ;</l>
     <l n="473">The language of delight its bondage broke ,</l>
     <l n="474">And many a warm heart bless 'd him as he spoke .</l>

     <l n="514">Of modest light , that trembled on the stream ;</l>
     <l n="515">The owl awoke , but dared not yet complain ,</l>
     <l n="516">And banish 'd silence re-assumed her reign .</l>
