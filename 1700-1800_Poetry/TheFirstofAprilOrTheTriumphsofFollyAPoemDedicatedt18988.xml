   <head>DEDICATION</head>
   <head>TO A</head>
   <head>CELEBRATED DUTCHESS .</head>
   <head>MADAM ,</head>
   <p>I am rather apprehensive that you will rank me among the Impertinents of the Age , in giving a performance which treats professedly of the Triumphs of Folly , the Sanction of Your Grace . But tho ’ , in the too great quickness of apprehension , this may be the case ; I have not the least doubt but , in some succeeding moments of coolness and candour , you will accompany me through this Address ; and not suffer a condemning spirit to pass a final sentence upon me , without giving some little attention to my justification .</p>
   <p>I need not tell Your Grace , that , in former times , every Family of Distinction was considered as incomplete in its establishment , if it did not possess a certain whimsical Character called a Fool ; who was either to afford amusement to his witty Master by the real singularity of his Humour ,— or to act as a foil to his foolish Lord by well-timed displays of affected Folly .— These appendages to Greatness have long been laid aside .— Indeed , the present Age , which is remarkable for its refinements , has , in the general methods of forming the Great , blended the two Characters ;— and it does not seldom happen , as Your Grace very well knows , that a Modern Man of Fashion serves his Company both as their Host and their Buffoon . I cannot therefore , in justice , be considered as guilty of any impropriety in addressing this work to Your Grace , as it relates to a Personage , who has heretofore possessed , as it were , a domestic union with the Great , by furnishing , from among her Children , the chief Wits of their noble Houses .</p>
   <p>Tho ’ it has changed its appearance , the connection has not ceased to subsist ; and FOLLY , though she extends her influence over all ranks and professions , still seems more particularly attached to the higher Orders of Life .</p>
   <p>FOLLY loves the Toilette of a Woman of Fashion !— It is her Altar .— The enormity of its expences ,— the frivolousness , to say no worse , of its conversation ,— and the time which is lost in attending its duties , are so many offerings to her honour . The love of display is inherent in her nature :— every place of public amusement is , more or less , her delight ;— but an Opera is her favourite entertainment .— There , she not only presides , but triumphs .— There , Sense , Taste , and Reason , lie beneath her Feet .</p>
   <p>As she is now become your intimate companion , I will not mortify Your Grace with the history of her origin , and an account of her genealogy , which I am sure would greatly distress you . Believe me , Madam , I should be sorry to give you a moment 's mortification . My sincere desire is to do you good , by warning you of the danger which awaits such a disgraceful connection .</p>
   <p>At your time of life it is not wholly unnatural that you should find something pleasant in the frolic gaiety of your Friend ; and the Flatterers , who are alike under her influence , may find something graceful in the manners which she might communicate to you : but in the Mirror of Wisdom , the highest beauties of FOLLY appear but as foul deformities ; and she is there seen in her natural appearance , attended by Vice , Contempt , and Misery .</p>
   <p>The Prosperity of Fools , says the Wise Man , shall destroy them . The influence of FOLLY is more dangerous , as the station it possesses is more exalted ; and as the means of doing good are more enlarged among the Rich and Great , that time is the more to be lamented which they consume in frivolous pursuits and empty pleasures .</p>
   <p>Without intruding upon your recollection the more awful obligations attendant upon your station in the world , you will forgive me if I just hint to Your Grace that Society has claims upon you , which you cannot refuse but with dishonour to yourself , and the contempt of those who possess the right which you refuse to grant ; a contempt which they will not fail to bestow .</p>
   <p>Give then to Society what it requires — a great and noble example of female excellence .— Discard your present Associate ;— cultivate the more solid Graces ;— exalt your character by the dignity of Virtue ;— and let continual actions of Benevolence and Generosity mark those hours which are passing hastily away , and will never return .</p>
   <p>Should Your Grace honour the following Poem , if it may deserve that name , with a perusal , you will , perhaps , consider me as a visionary Character .— Be that as it may ,— I am quite awake to your Honour and Interest in the Counsels I have given you ; and if your Grace should adopt them , you will awake also .— The Visions of Folly will vanish away ;— and your eyes will open on the real prospect of wise and honourable days .</p>
   <p>I am , Madam , with all due respect ,</p>
   <p>Your Grace 's most sincere Friend ,</p>
   <p>And humble Servant ,</p>

    <head>THE</head>
    <head>FIRST OF APRIL .</head>
    <head>‘ Twas on the Morn when April doth appear , And wets the Primrose with its maiden tear ; ‘ Twas on the Morn when laughing FOLLY rules , And calls her Sons around , and dubs them Fools ; Bids them be bold , some untry 'd path explore , And do such deeds as Fools ne'er did before ; ‘ Twas on that Morn , when Fancy took her stand Beside my couch , and , with fantastic wand , Wav 'd , from her airy cells , the Antic Train That play their gay delusions on the brain : And strait , methought , a rude impetuous Throng , With noise and riot , hurried me along , To where a sumptuous Building met my eyes , Whose gilded turrets seem 'd to dare the skies . To every Wind it op 'd an ample door , From every Wind tumultuous thousands pour . With these I enter 'd a stupendous Hall , The scene of some approaching festival . O'er the wide portals , full in sight , were spread Banners of yellow hue , bestrip 'd with red , Whereon , in golden characters , were seen : THE ANNIVERSARY OF FOLLY 'S QUEEN ! Strange motley ornaments the Building grac 'd , With every emblem of corrupted Taste . No stately Column rose to meet the Dome , No Sculpture borrow 'd from the Arts of Rome ; No well-wrought Frieze crept graceful on the walls , Th ’ Acanthus weav 'd no splendid Capitals ; Nor did the Attic elegance supply One simple foliage for the judging eye . But , in their stead , Confusion void of Sense , And all the pride of false Magnificence , Display 'd an idle , vain , fantastic show , Fit only for the Crowd that gaz 'd below .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Gay China 's unsubstantial forms supply</l>
     <l n="2">The place of Beauty , Strength , Simplicity .</l>
     <l n="3">Each varied colour , of the brightest hue ,</l>
     <l n="4">The green , the red , the yellow , and the blue ,</l>
     <l n="5">In every part the dazzled eyes behold ,</l>
     <l n="6">Here streak 'd with silver , there enrich 'd with gold ;</l>
     <l n="7">While fancied forms upon the ceiling sprawl ,</l>
     <l n="8">And shapeless monsters decorate the wall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">In every scatter 'd niche I look 'd in vain</l>
     <l n="10">For Heroes famous on th ’ embattled plain ;</l>
     <l n="11">Or animated Bust , whose brow severe</l>
     <l n="12">Mark 'd the sage Statesman or Philosopher .</l>
     <l n="13">But in the place of those whose Patriot fame</l>
     <l n="14">Gave glory to the Greek and Roman name ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or Heroes who for Freedom bravely fought ,</l>
     <l n="16">Men without heads ,— and Heads that ’ never thought ,</l>
     <l n="17">Greet my sick eye ,— with all their names enroll 'd</l>
     <l n="18">In the vain pomp of prostituted gold .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="19">Nor had the Painter 's active hand restrain 'd</l>
     <l n="20">The all-bedaubing brush : the walls were stain 'd</l>
     <l n="21">With the gay colourings of capricious Art ,</l>
     <l n="22">Wherein nor Truth nor Genius bore a part .</l>
     <l n="23">There Sigismunda 's form again I knew ,</l>
     <l n="24">Which FOLLY hinted , and old Hogarth drew .</l>
     <l n="25">No sketch of REYNOLD 's pencil did appear ,</l>
     <l n="26">Science and Taste found no admittance there ;</l>
     <l n="27">But the vain Painter had essay 'd to trace ,</l>
     <l n="28">In rude distortion , and with strange grimace ,</l>
     <l n="29">Each story the Historic Pages tell ,</l>
     <l n="30">Where FOLLY triumph 'd , and where WISDOM fell .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="31">There the great BACON , whose sagacious eye</l>
     <l n="32">Pierc 'd through the gloom of dark Philosophy ,</l>
     <l n="33">And to the World unveil 'd her awful face ,</l>
     <l n="34">Crouch 'd a low , servile Courtier in disgrace .</l>
     <l n="35">There PULTENEY , who the first stout bulwark stood</l>
     <l n="36">Of British Freedom ‘ gainst the torrent flood</l>
     <l n="37">Of dire Corruption , having stemm 'd the wave ,</l>
     <l n="38">Shook off the Patriot , and became the Slave .</l>
     <l n="39">There PITT , whose great and comprehensive soul</l>
     <l n="40">No threats could frighten , no events controul ;</l>
     <l n="41">Whose name dash 'd terror on his Country 's foes ,</l>
     <l n="42">From GALLIA 'S Shores to where the GANGES flows</l>
     <l n="43">Through Eastern Nations ;— There he wore the chain</l>
     <l n="44">Of Royal Gold , and join 'd the pension 'd Train .</l>
     <l n="45">But the Muse weeps , and drops the silent tear</l>
     <l n="46">O'er the sad truths which were recorded there .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="47">High , in the midst , a Pageant of a Throne</l>
     <l n="48">In the extreme of Tinsel Splendor shone .</l>
     <l n="49">No Sacred Ensigns , no Imperial Chair ,</l>
     <l n="50">Mark 'd the high worth of those who counseled there ;</l>
     <l n="51">But , shaded by a Curtain 's vivid green ,</l>
     <l n="52">A splendid , soft , luxuriant Couch was seen .</l>
     <l n="53">The spangled Banners glitter 'd all around ,</l>
     <l n="54">And the unfolded Silver strew 'd the ground ;</l>
     <l n="55">While the false Mirrors pain the dazzled eye</l>
     <l n="56">With mingled Forms , and gay Perplexity .</l>
     <l n="57">Hung from the roof by many a golden thread ,</l>
     <l n="58">The Canopy its airy cov'ring spread ,</l>
     <l n="59">Inwove with plumage borrow 'd from the wing }</l>
     <l n="60">Of India 's feather 'd Tribe , or those that sing }</l>
     <l n="61">‘ Mid the green woodlands of a Western Spring . }</l>
     <l n="62">Before the Throne a splendid Altar stood ,</l>
     <l n="63">Inlaid , in curious forms , with fragrant wood ;</l>
     <l n="64">Whereon the faithful Votaries might lay</l>
     <l n="65">Their Offerings sacred to the festal day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="66">Methought , that , tir 'd of the disgusting scene ,</l>
     <l n="67">Fit for Fools only , and their silly Queen ,</l>
     <l n="68">I sought in haste to leave the inglorious Throng :</l>
     <l n="69">But as the pressing Crowd my steps prolong ,</l>
     <l n="70">The deafening Cymbals , and the noisy brawl</l>
     <l n="71">Of pealing Laughter , ecchoed round the Hall .</l>
     <l n="72">And strait a troop of dancing Youths appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="73">Of rosy hue , by friendly BACCHUS chear 'd .</l>
     <l n="74">The tinkling bells upon their feet they wore ;</l>
     <l n="75">Each , in his hand , a rural Tabor bore ,</l>
     <l n="76">Whose sides they frequent beat , and , at the sound ,</l>
     <l n="77">Aloft in air , with , antic step , they bound .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="78">Next came a blooming Boy in robe of green ;</l>
     <l n="79">On his fair brow a flowery crown was seen ,</l>
     <l n="80">Where the pale Primrose with the Cowslip vied ,</l>
     <l n="81">And fragrant Violets shone in purple pride .</l>
     <l n="82">Upon a Bull he rode , whose horns were gay</l>
     <l n="83">With many a golden flower and budding spray .</l>
     <l n="84">Around him every vernal Songster fled ,</l>
     <l n="85">While the Lark soar 'd and whistled o'er his head .</l>
     <l n="86">And now he smil 'd with joy , and now , apace ,</l>
     <l n="87">The crystal tears bedew 'd his alter 'd face .</l>
     <l n="88">Like the young Fondling on his Mother 's breast ,</l>
     <l n="89">Who cries for absent joys , and thinks them best :</l>
     <l n="90">‘ Mid smiles , and tears , and frowns , he onward came ,</l>
     <l n="91">With gentle pace ,— and APRIL was his name .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="92">To him succeeds a light and frolic Train</l>
     <l n="93">Of wanton Females , insolent and vain ,</l>
     <l n="94">Whose cheeks , by Art encrimson 'd , far outvie</l>
     <l n="95">The vivid hue of blushing Modesty .</l>
     <l n="96">Their auburn ringlets float not in the air ;</l>
     <l n="97">No silken fillet binds their flowing hair ;</l>
     <l n="98">But , plaister 'd into form , the curls disgrace</l>
     <l n="99">Each animated feature of the face .</l>
     <l n="100">The gladsome Fair , in honour of the day ,</l>
     <l n="101">With artificial flow'rets strew 'd the way .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="102">But in what language shall the Muse describe</l>
     <l n="103">The dancing , dressing Millinery Tribe ,</l>
     <l n="104">Who , with their various emblems , next appear ,</l>
     <l n="105">And joyful tell th ’ approach of FASHION near .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="106">With mincing step the fickle Princess came :</l>
     <l n="107">Th ’ attending Crowds shout forth her empty name .</l>
     <l n="108">Strange was her form ,— her look , her dress were strange ;</l>
     <l n="109">And yet each moment saw their sudden change .</l>
     <l n="110">Now her Locks soar aloft , and threat the sky ;</l>
     <l n="111">Now shade the brightness of her rolling eye :</l>
     <l n="112">Awhile they on her wanton bosom break ;</l>
     <l n="113">Then , upward forc 'd , display th ’ uncover 'd neck .</l>
     <l n="114">Ere the long train could spread its shady folds ,—</l>
     <l n="115">Drawn up ,— a knot the alter 'd vestment holds .</l>
     <l n="116">Soon fade the glories of th ’ enormous Plume ;</l>
     <l n="117">As soon the superseding Chaplets bloom .</l>
     <l n="118">The rigid Stay , whose daring height conceals</l>
     <l n="119">Those swelling charms where many a Cupid dwells ,</l>
     <l n="120">Ere they can heave again ,— no more appear ;</l>
     <l n="121">But leave each vulgar eye to revel there .</l>
     <l n="122">As I look 'd down , the dropping Silk denies</l>
     <l n="123">Her pretty feet to my intruding eyes :</l>
     <l n="124">Again I look 'd ,— th ’ according flounce updrew ,</l>
     <l n="125">And gave the well-turn 'd ankle to my view .</l>
     <l n="126">Now stiff ,— now slouching in her gait she walk 'd ;</l>
     <l n="127">Now lisp 'd , now mouth 'd each sentence as she talk 'd .</l>
     <l n="128">A form so changeful I had never seen ;—</l>

     <l n="130">In quick succession , o'er her figure past ,</l>
     <l n="131">A moment loiter 'd , but refus 'd to last .</l>
     <l n="132">And as , in various pride , she mov 'd along ,</l>
     <l n="133">Now charm 'd ,— now angry with the shouting Throng ,</l>
     <l n="134">Submissive Eunuchs to their Mistress bend ,</l>

     <l n="463">And now before the Shrine , promiscuous , lie</l>
     <l n="464">The Morning Blame , the Evening Flattery ;</l>

     <l n="538">Amid the duties of maturer age ,</l>
