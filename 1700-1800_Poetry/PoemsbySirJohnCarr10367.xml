    <docTitle><titlePart>POEMS . DEDICATION . TO LADY WARREN , &amp; c. &amp; c. &amp; c. MADAM , In dedicating the following Poems to your Ladyship , I cannot help regretting that they are not more worthy of such an honour ; that I might consequently have used it as an humble mode of expressing my sense of the happy and enlightened hours which I have passed in your Ladyship 's society , and of the polite attentions which I have at various times received from you , and the gallant object of your connubial affection , particularly at the House of British Embassy at Petersburgh , where you afforded to the Ladies of the North a just representation of the dignified virtue , cultivated mind , and attractive beauty , of the higher order of females of your own country . I have the honour to remain , Madam , Your Ladyship 's Obedient faithful Servant , JOHN CARR .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">This Volume is submitted to the Public with all that diffidence which ought to attend the publication of Verses , many of which were written in the gay and happy era of boyhood , and others in subsequent periods of maturer life , as a relief from more arduous pursuits .</p>
    <p n="2">They lay no pretensions to the depth and solidity of the effusions of the Muse in her elevated flights ; they are the few wild notes of the simple shepherd , and do not even affect to imitate the rich cadence of the scientific musician .</p>
    <p n="3">If the Author might , without the imputation of vanity , select for them a place in the Temple of Poetry , he would endeavour to class them in that niche which is appropriated for the reception of the light and playful Vers de Societé .</p>
    <p n="4">Should the Reader find them but little worthy of his approval , he will not have reason at the same time to condemn their prolixity : their brevity will , at least in some degree , atone for their want of fire and fancy .</p>
    <p n="5">It is thought proper to state that some of the following Poems have appeared before at various times , in a fugitive shape ; and that the Poetry in the Author 's Tours is here collected .</p>

    <head>WRITTEN IN A GROTTO</head>
     <l n="1">In a Wood on the Side of the River Dart ,</l>
   </lg>
   <lg type="poem">
    <head>IN DEVONSHIRE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Tell me , thou grotto ! o'er whose brow are seen</l>
     <l n="2">Projecting plumes , and shades of deep'ning green ,—</l>
     <l n="3">While not a sound disturbs thy stony hall ,</l>
     <l n="4">While all thy dewy drops forget to fall ,—</l>
     <l n="5">Why canst thou not thy soothing charms impart ,</l>
     <l n="6">And shed thy quiet o'er this beating heart ?</l>
     <l n="7">Tell me , thou richly-painted river ! tell ,</l>
     <l n="8">That on thy mirror 'd plane dost mimic well</l>
     <l n="9">Each pendent tree and every distant hill ,</l>
     <l n="10">Tipp 'd with red lustre , beauteous , bright , and still ,—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Can I not , gazing on thy tranquil tide ,</l>
     <l n="12">Shed ev'ry grief upon thy rocky side ?</l>
     <l n="13">Or must I rove thy margin , calm and clear ,</l>
     <l n="14">The only agitated object near ?</l>
     <l n="15">Oh ! tell me , too , thou babbling cold cascade !</l>
     <l n="16">Whose waters , falling thro ’ successive shade ,</l>
     <l n="17">Unspangled by the brightness of the sky ,</l>
     <l n="18">Awake each echo to a soft reply ,—</l>
     <l n="19">Say , canst thou not my bosom-grief befriend ,</l>
     <l n="20">And bid one drop upon my heart descend ?</l>
     <l n="21">When all thy songsters soothe themselves to sleep .</l>
     <l n="22">Ah ! must these aching eyes for ever weep ?</l>
     <l n="23">And must their frequent waters , like thine own ,</l>
     <l n="24">Drop , idly drop , on unimpressive stone ?</l>
     <l n="25">Or , when my beauteous fair shall deign to grace</l>
     <l n="26">The humid foliage of thy mossy base ,</l>
     <l n="27">Canst thou not tell how many a rock below</l>
     <l n="28">Impedes to kiss thy waters as they flow ?</l>
     <l n="29">In her mind canst thou not the feeling rear</l>
     <l n="30">To stop , or thus caress , each genuine tear ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="31">Teach her , oh ! teach her , then , thou cold cascade !</l>
     <l n="32">Pour all thy lessons for the lovely maid !</l>
     <l n="33">And thou , bless 'd grotto ! let thy silence prove</l>
     <l n="34">Her mute consenting answer to my love !</l>
     <l n="35">And thou , bright river ! as thou roll'st along ,</l>
     <l n="36">Bear on thy wand'ring wave a lover 's song !</l>
     <l n="37">Strong as thy current , as thy waters pure ,</l>
     <l n="38">Teach her to feel the passion I endure !</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">Tho ’ no funereal grandeur swell my song ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nor genius , eagle-plum 'd , the strain prolong ,—</l>
     <l n="6">Tho ’ Grief and Nature here alone combine</l>
     <l n="7">To weep , my William ! o'er a fate like thine ,—</l>
     <l n="8">Yet thy fond pray'r , still ling'ring on my ear ,</l>
     <l n="9">Shall force its way thro ’ many a gushing tear :</l>
     <l n="10">The Muse , that saw thy op'ning beauties spread ,</l>
     <l n="11">That lov 'd thee living , shall lament thee dead !</l>
     <l n="12">Ye graceful Virtues ! while the note I breathe ,</l>
     <l n="13">Of sweetest flow'rs entwine a fun'ral wreath ,—</l>
     <l n="14">Of virgin flow'rs , and place them round his tomb ,</l>
     <l n="15">To bud , like him , and perish in their bloom !</l>
     <l n="16">Ah ! when these eyes saw thee serenely wait</l>
     <l n="17">The last long separating stroke of Fate ,—</l>
     <l n="18">When round thy bed a kindred weeping train</l>
     <l n="19">Call 'd on thy voice to greet them , but in vain ,—</l>
     <l n="20">When o'er thy lips we watch 'd thy fault'ring breath —</l>
     <l n="21">When louder grief proclaim 'd th'approach of death ,—</l>
     <l n="22">Thro ’ ev'ry vein an icy horror chill 'd ,</l>
     <l n="23">Colder than marble ev'ry bosom thrill 'd .</l>
     <l n="24">Unsettled still , tho ’ exercis 'd to grieve ,</l>
     <l n="25">Scarce would my mind the alter 'd sight believe ;</l>
     <l n="26">Familiar scenes a transient calm inspire ,</l>
     <l n="27">Poor flutt'ring Fancy fann 'd the vain desire ,</l>
     <l n="28">‘ Till with sad proof thy wasted relics rise ,</l>
     <l n="29">And restless Nature pours uncall'dhYpppHeNfor sighs .</l>
     <l n="30">Ah ! long , my William ! shall thy picture rest ,</l>
     <l n="31">Time shall not wear it , imag 'd in my breast ;</l>
     <l n="32">Yes , thou shall live while fond remembrance lives ,</l>
     <l n="33">‘ Till he who mourns thee asks the line he gives .</l>
     <l n="34">No common joy , no fugitive delight ,</l>
     <l n="35">Regret like this could in my breast excite ;</l>
     <l n="36">For then my sorrow had been less severe ,</l>
     <l n="37">And tears less copious had bedew 'd the bier .</l>
     <l n="38">From the same breast our milky food we drew ,</l>
     <l n="39">Entwin 'd affection strengthen 'd as we grew ;</l>
     <l n="40">Why further trace ? The flatt'ring dream is o'er —</l>
     <l n="41">Thy transient joys and sorrows are no more !</l>
     <l n="42">All , all are fled !— And , ah ! where'er I turn ,</l>
     <l n="43">Insulting Death directs me to thy urn ,</l>
     <l n="44">Throws his cold shadows round me while I sing .</l>
     <l n="45">Damps ev'ry nerve , and slackens ev'ry string .</l>
     <l n="46">So , when the Moon trims up her waning fire ,</l>
     <l n="47">Sweep the night-breezes o'er th'Aeolian lyre ;</l>
     <l n="48">Ling'ring , perchance , some wild pathetic sound</l>
     <l n="49">Lulls the lorn ear , and dies along the ground .</l>
     <l n="50">Ye kindred train ! who , o'er the parting grave ,</l>
     <l n="51">Have mourn 'd the virtues which ye could not save .</l>
     <l n="52">Ye know how Mem'ry , with excursive pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="53">Extracts a sweet from ev'ry faded hour ;—</l>
     <l n="54">From scenes long past , regardless of repose ,</l>
     <l n="55">She feeds her tears , and treasures up her woes .</l>
     <l n="56">Thou tuneful , mute , companion [ A ] of my care !</l>
     <l n="57">Where now thy notes , that linger 'd in the air ?</l>
     <l n="58">That linger still !— Vain thy harmonious store ,—</l>
     <l n="59">Thy sweet persuasive triumphs are no more .</l>
     <l n="60">Thy mournful image strikes my wand'ring eye ;</l>
     <l n="61">Sad , near thy silent strings , I sit and sigh .</l>
     <l n="62">Cold is that band which Music form 'd her own ,</l>
     <l n="63">When ev'ry chord resign 'd its sweetest tone .</l>
     <l n="64">Ah ! long , fair source of rapture , shall thou rest ,</l>
     <l n="65">Silent and sad , neglected and unprest ,</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Till years , lov 'd shade ! superior pow'rs resign ,</l>
     <l n="67">Or raise one note more eloquent than thine .</l>
     <l n="68">Tho ’ with'ring Sickness mark 'd thee in the womb ,</l>
     <l n="69">And form 'd thy cradle but to form thy tomb ,</l>
     <l n="70">Yet , like a flow'r , she bade thee reach thy prime ,</l>
     <l n="71">The fairer victim for the stroke of Time .</l>
     <l n="72">When fond Invention vainly sought thine ease ,</l>
     <l n="73">The wave salubrious and the morning breeze ,—</l>
     <l n="74">When even Sleep , sweet Sleep ! refus 'd thy call ,</l>
     <l n="75">Sleep ! that with sweet refreshment smiles on all ,—</l>
     <l n="76">When , till the morn , thine eyes , unclos 'd and damp ,</l>
     <l n="77">Trac 'd thy sad semblance in the glimm'ring lamp ,—</l>
     <l n="78">When from thy face Health 's latest relic fled ,</l>
     <l n="79">Where Hope might flatter , with reluctant tread ,—</l>
     <l n="80">Still , darting forward from the weight of woe ,</l>
     <l n="81">Thy soul with all its energy would glow ;</l>
     <l n="82">Still with the purest passion wouldst thou prove</l>
     <l n="83">The glow of friendship and the warmth of love .</l>
     <l n="84">And ah ! to sacred Memory ever nigh ,</l>
     <l n="85">Thy wit and humour claim the passing sigh :</l>
     <l n="86">When , thro ’ the hour , with unresisted skill ,</l>
     <l n="87">I 've seen thee mould each feature to thy will ,—</l>
     <l n="88">When friends drew round thee with attentive ear ,</l>
     <l n="89">Pleas 'd with the raill'ry which they could not fear .</l>
     <l n="90">Oh ! how I 've heard thee , with concealing art ,</l>
     <l n="91">Join in the song , tho ’ sorrow rent thy heart ;</l>
     <l n="92">How have I seen thee too , with venial guile ,</l>
     <l n="93">O'er many an anguish force the faithless smile ,—</l>
     <l n="94">Seen suffering Nature check each sigh , each fear ,</l>
     <l n="95">To rob maternal fondness of a tear !</l>
     <l n="96">Alas ! those scenes are past !— Vain was the pray'r</l>
     <l n="97">That ask 'd of Fate to soften and to spare ;</l>
     <l n="98">Ah ! vain , if wit and virtue could not save</l>
     <l n="99">Thy youthful honours from an early grave .</l>
     <l n="100">But yet , if here my warm fraternal love</l>
     <l n="101">May claim alliance with the realms above ;</l>
     <l n="102">If kindred Nature , with perpetual bloom ,</l>
     <l n="103">Transplanted springs , and lives beyond the tomb ;</l>
     <l n="104">Thy pitying soul shall smile upon my grief ,</l>
     <l n="105">Shall feel a pang that wishes not relief ;</l>
     <l n="106">In visions still shall shield me as I go ,</l>
     <l n="107">Along this gloomy wilderness of woe ;</l>
     <l n="108">Shall still regard me with peculiar pride ,</l>
     <l n="109">On earth my brother , and in heav'n my guide !</l>
     <l n="110">Methinks I see thee reach th ’ empyrean shore ,</l>
     <l n="111">And heav'n ' s full chorus hails one angel more ;</l>
     <l n="112">While ‘ mid the seraph-forms that round thee fly ,</l>
     <l n="113">Thy father meets thee with ecstatic eye !</l>
     <l n="114">He springs exulting from his throne of rest ,</l>
     <l n="115">Extends his arms , and clasps thee to his breast !</l>

<note>Footnote A : The manor of Berry was given by William the Conqueror to one of his Normans , Ralph de la Pomerai , who built on it the castle which still bears his name , and in whose family it continued till the reign of Edward VI . when it was sold by Sir Thomas Pomeroy to Edward Seymour , Duke of Somerset , from whom it has descended to the present Duke .</note>   <note xml:id="noteA_6" place="bottom" n="A">The manor of Berry was given by William the Conqueror to one of his Normans , Ralph de la Pomerai , who built on it the castle which still bears his name , and in whose family it continued till the reign of Edward VI . when it was sold by Sir Thomas Pomeroy to Edward Seymour , Duke of Somerset , from whom it has descended to the present Duke .</note>
   <p>The castle is seated upon a rock , which rises almost perpendicularly from a narrow valley ; through this valley winds a small stream of water , which drives the mill seen through the foliage of the surrounding woods from the turrets of the castle .</p>
   <p>In approaching the castle from the south , the path leads down the side of a hill through a thick wood ; and on the north side of the valley , opposite the rock on which the castle stands , is a high ridge , partly covered with oak : these hills completely shut in the ruins on both sides . The valley stretches a considerable way both to the east and west , and opens a view at either end into the adjacent country .</p>
   <p>From the ivy-covered ruins of the fortress which now remain , it is scarcely possible to say what was its ancient form ; but it is most generally supposed to have been quadrangular , having only one entrance , a large double portcullis , at the west end of the southern front , turreted and embattled , as was the whole of the front , with a tower at its eastern end , corresponding with that on the west . This front , with its gateway and turrets , are perhaps the only remains of the original structure . Winding steps , now almost worn away , lead to what once was a chapel , over the portcullis , and thence to the top of the turrets .</p>
   <p>In more modern times a magnificent building was erected within the walls of the castle by the Seymour family ; but , although upwards of £ 20 , 000 were said to have been expended on it , it was never finished , and now the whole forms one common ruin , which , as it totters on it base , the spectator contemplates with awe , while he sighs over the remains of fallen grandeur . ]</p>

<note>Footnote A : Dronningaard is the first private residence in Denmark : it belongs to the wealthy family of the De Conincks . The grounds , which are very extensive , and tastefully laid out , slope down to a noble lake , twelve English miles in circumference , which is skirted with fine woods and romantic country-houses . At the end of a beautiful walk is an elegant marble column , with a tablet , on which is inscribed by Mr. D. C. “ This monument is erected in gratitude to a mild and beneficent Government , under whose auspices I enjoy the blessings that surround me . ” In another part of the grounds , in a spot of deep seclusion , are the ruins of a Hermitage ; and a little further , in a nook , an open grave and tombstone . The story connected with this retired spot deserves to be mentioned :— Time has shed many snows upon the romantic beauties of Dronningaard , since one , who , weary of the pomp of courts and the tumult of camps , in the prime of life , covered with honours and with fortune , sought from its hospitable owner permission to raise a sequestered cell , in which he might pass the remainder of his days in all the austerities and privations of an Anchorite . This singular man had , long previously to the revolution in Holland , distinguished himself at the head of his regiment , when , in an unhappy moment , the love of aggrandizement took possession of his heart , and , marrying under its influence , misery soon followed ; and here , in a little wood of tall firs , he raised this simple fabric : moss warmed it within , and the bark of the birch defended it without ; a stream of rock-water once flowed in a bed of pebbles before the door , in which the young willow dipped its leaves ; and , at a little distance from a bed of wild roses , the labernum gracefully rose , and suspended her yellow flowers ; and adjoining was a spot which the Recluse had selected for his grave , of which , like the monks of La Trappe , he dug a small portion every day until he had finished it . He composed his Epitaph in French , and had it inscribed on a stone . If the reader is at much interested as I was in the history of the poor Hermit , he will be pleased with the translation of it , which follows , from the pen of my respected and distinguished friend , William Hayley , Esq . In this solitude he passed several years , when the plan of his life became suddenly reversed by a letter of recall , which he received from his Prince , containing the most flattering expressions of regard . He obeyed the summons , returned to Holland , and at the head of his regiment most gallantly fought and fell .</note>   <note xml:id="noteA_10" place="bottom" n="A">Dronningaard is the first private residence in Denmark : it belongs to the wealthy family of the De Conincks .

     <l n="38">The lovely maid to trace each ringlet green ,</l>
     <l n="39">Not distant far thy skin of velvet white</l>
     <l n="40">She views , and to thee presses with delight</l>
     <l n="41">Oh ! might some deity , with potent arm ,</l>
     <l n="42">Arrest her flight , and alter ev'ry charm ;</l>
     <l n="43">Like Niobe dissolve into a tear ,</l>
     <l n="44">Or like the Delian virgin , when with fear</l>
     <l n="45">She fled !— See on each beauteous limb appear</l>
     <l n="46">Soft leaves and flow'rs , the sweetest of the year ;</l>
     <l n="47">And , taking root , spread round her fragrant breath</l>
     <l n="48">O'er the fair form that now she dooms to death :</l>
     <l n="49">But , ah ! in vain , the pray'r no goddess hears ; }</l>
     <l n="50">She bends — she plucks — and , bath 'd in purple tears ,}</l>
     <l n="51">The much-priz 'd victim in her lap she bears ! }</l>
     <l n="52">Tears that , preserv 'd in crystal , will prolong ,</l>
     <l n="53">And paint its worth beyond this simple song .</l>

    <head>LINES</head>
    <head>TO A PROMISING YOUNG ARTIST .</head>
     <l n="1">These bays be thine ; and , tho ’ not form 'd to shine</l>
     <l n="2">Clear as thy colour , faultless as thy line ,</l>
     <l n="3">Yet shall the Muse essay , in humble verse ,</l>
     <l n="4">Thy merits , lovely Painting ! to rehearse .</l>
     <l n="5">As when the demon of the winter storm</l>
     <l n="6">Robs each sweet flow'ret of its beauteous form ,</l>
     <l n="7">The Spirit of the stream , in crystal wave ,</l>
     <l n="8">Sleeps whilst the chilling blasts above him rave ,</l>
     <l n="9">Till the Sun spreads his animating fires ,</l>
     <l n="10">And sullen Darkness from the scene retires ,</l>
     <l n="11">Then mountain-nymphs discard their robes of snow ,</l>
     <l n="12">And in green mantles smile in roseate glow ,</l>
     <l n="13">And rivers , loosen 'd from their icy chain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Spread joy and richness thro ’ the verdant plain ,</l>
     <l n="15">Thus , in those climes where skies are ever fair ,</l>
     <l n="16">Each infant Science breath 'd a genial air ,</l>
     <l n="17">Climes where the Earth her stores to all resign 'd ,</l>
     <l n="18">Nor left one selfish passion to the mind ;</l>
     <l n="19">On her green lap the swain reclin 'd his head ,</l>
     <l n="20">And found his banquet where he found his bed .</l>
     <l n="21">Then Painting grew , and from the shades of flow'rs [ A ]</l>
     <l n="22">There first essay 'd her imitative pow'rs ,</l>
     <l n="23">When , urg 'd by plunder , with the torrent 's might ,</l>
     <l n="24">Nerv 'd by the storm , and harden 'd in the fight ,</l>
     <l n="25">A race barbarian left their forests wild ,</l>
     <l n="26">And sought the spot where Love and Learning smil 'd .</l>
     <l n="27">By Taste unsoften 'd , these relentless droves</l>
     <l n="28">Burst , fair Italia ! thro ’ thy sacred groves ,</l>
     <l n="29">Laid ev'ry flow'r of Art and Fancy waste ,</l>
     <l n="30">And pour 'd a winter o'er the realms of Taste ,</l>
     <l n="31">Each Science trembled at the ruffian sound ,</l>
     <l n="32">Forsook her shades , and fled her classic ground ;</l>
     <l n="33">The lofty column prostrate in the dust ,</l>
     <l n="34">Defac 'd the arch , o'erthrown the matchless bust ;</l>
     <l n="35">The shatter 'd fresco animates no more ,</l>
     <l n="36">And ruthless winds thro ’ clefted temples roar !</l>
     <l n="37">Florence beheld the scene with sad surprise ,</l>
     <l n="38">And bade the prostrate pile in grandeur rise .</l>
     <l n="39">Then , oh ! thou truly “ Father of the Art [ B ] ! ”</l>
     <l n="40">‘ Twas thine superior vigour to impart ;</l>
     <l n="41">Illustrious Cimabue ! it was thine</l>
     <l n="42">To soar beyond Example 's bounded line ,</l>
     <l n="43">And , as the Heav'nhYpppHeNdirected sceptre 's shock ,</l>
     <l n="44">Produc 'd full torrents from the flinty rock ,</l>
     <l n="45">So streams of taste obey 'd thy pencil 's call ,</l>
     <l n="46">And Nature seem 'd to start from out the wall .</l>
     <l n="47">Hail , beauteous art ! oh ! that in equal lay</l>
     <l n="48">Could but my Muse thy various pow'rs convey !</l>
     <l n="49">‘ Tis thine with silent eloquence to shew</l>
     <l n="50">Passion 's strong image , Beauty 's rapt'rous glow ,</l>
     <l n="51">To soothe the parted lover 's anxious care ,</l>
     <l n="52">Who owns thee fairest of thy sisters fair ;</l>
     <l n="53">When waves divide him , still thro ’ thee to trace</l>
     <l n="54">The dear resemblance of that cherish 'd face ,</l>
     <l n="55">Which he so oft with trembling lips has prest ,</l>
     <l n="56">So often gaz 'd upon , so often blest !</l>
     <l n="57">Thine too it is to seek the verdant plains</l>
     <l n="58">Where Peace resides , where Rustic Beauty reigns ;</l>
     <l n="59">Or bid the torrent on thy canvass roar ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or calmly spread the yellow winding shore ;</l>
     <l n="61">Or show , from some vast cliff 's extremest verge ,</l>
     <l n="62">The frail bark combating the angry surge .</l>
     <l n="63">Oft too on some lone turret wilt thou stand ,</l>
     <l n="64">To trace the fury of th ’ embattled band ,</l>
     <l n="65">To darken with the clouds of death the skies ,</l>
     <l n="66">And bid the scenes of blood and havoc rise !</l>
     <l n="67">Such , and far more , thy pow'rs , bless 'd art ! to thee</l>
     <l n="68">Inferior far descriptive Poesy ;</l>
     <l n="69">And tho ’ sweet Music , when she strikes the strings ,</l>
     <l n="70">When thro ’ the grove with seraph-voice she sings ,</l>
     <l n="71">The soul , enraptur 'd with the thrilling stream ,</l>
     <l n="72">Would hail the Maid of Harmony supreme !</l>
     <l n="73">Yet , while her dulcet sounds enchant , they die ;}</l>
     <l n="74">So shooting stare illume the midnight sky , }</l>
     <l n="75">And , as we wonder , vanish from the eye . }</l>
     <l n="76">But when resistless Death , in mournful hour ,</l>
     <l n="77">Withdraws the drooping painter 's mimic pow'r ,</l>
     <l n="78">Improv 'd by time , his works still charm the sight ,</l>
     <l n="79">And thro ’ successive ages yield delight</l>
     <l n="80">Greece early bade the painter 's pencil trace</l>
     <l n="81">Each form with force ; to force she added grace :</l>
     <l n="82">For this her Zeuxis she a garland wove ,</l>
     <l n="83">For [ C ] that Apelles won her grateful love .</l>
     <l n="84">Chiefly she called on Painting 's magic powers</l>
     <l n="85">To deck the guardians of her lofty tow'rs ;</l>
     <l n="86">Here [ D ] Jove in lightning show 'd his awful mien .</l>
     <l n="87">There Venus with her doves was smiling seen !</l>
     <l n="88">Till ruthless Time , with unabating flight ,</l>
     <l n="89">O'er Grecian grandeur flung the shades of night</l>
     <l n="90">Long did they settle o'er the darken 'd world .</l>
     <l n="91">Till Raphael 's hand the sable curtain furl 'd ;</l>
     <l n="92">A pious calm , an elevated grace ,</l>
     <l n="93">Then on the canvass mark 'd th ’ Apostle 's face ;</l>
     <l n="94">Devout applauses ev'ry feature drew ,</l>
     <l n="95">E'en [ E ] such as graceful Sculpture never knew .</l>
     <l n="96">In nearer times , and on a neighb'ring shore ,</l>
     <l n="97">Painting but feebly shone , obscur 'd by pow'r .</l>
     <l n="98">See Rubens ’ soul indignantly advance ,</l>
     <l n="99">Press 'd by the pride and vanity of France ;</l>
     <l n="100">Behold , [ F ] in fulsome allegory spread ,</l>
     <l n="101">The gaudy iris o'er the victor 's head !</l>
     <l n="102">See Genius , deaf to Nature 's nobler call ,</l>
     <l n="103">Waste all its strength upon the banner 'd hall !</l>
     <l n="104">E'en now , tho ’ Gallia , in her blood-stain 'd car ,</l>
     <l n="105">Spreads over Europe all the woes of war ,</l>
     <l n="106">Still with consummate craft she tries to prove</l>
     <l n="107">How much the peaceful charms engage her love :</l>
     <l n="108">Treasures of art in lengthen 'd gall'ries glow ,</l>
     <l n="109">And [ G ] Europe 's plunder Europe 's plund'rers show !</l>
     <l n="110">Yet of her living artists few can claim</l>
     <l n="111">Half the mix 'd praise that waits on David 's fame .</l>
     <l n="112">Thrice happy Britain ! in thy favour 'd isle</l>
     <l n="113">The sister Arts in health and beauty smile !</l>
     <l n="114">Tho ’ no Imperial Gall'ries grace thy shores ,</l>
     <l n="115">Tho ’ wealth the public bounty seldom pours ,</l>
     <l n="116">Yet private taste rewards thy painter 's toil ,</l>
     <l n="117">And bids his genius grace his native soil .</l>
     <l n="118">Bless 'd country ! here thy artists can supply</l>
     <l n="119">Abundant charms to fix th ’ admiring eye :</l>
     <l n="120">In furtive splendour ne'er art thou array 'd ,</l>
     <l n="121">No plunder 'd country mourns thy ruthless blade ,</l>
     <l n="122">Sees its transported treasures torn away ,</l>
     <l n="123">To grace a fierce ambitious Tyrant 's sway .</l>
     <l n="124">Long in this isle , where Freedom finds repose ,</l>
     <l n="125">Whilst , raving round her , loud the tempest blows ,</l>
     <l n="126">Oh ! long befriended , may the Arts excel ,</l>
     <l n="127">And bless the sacred spot they love so well !</l>
