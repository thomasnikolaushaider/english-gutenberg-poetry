    <docTitle><titlePart>THE CULPRIT FAY . “ My visual orbs are purged from film , and lo ! “ Instead of Anster 's turnip-bearing vales “ I see old fairy land 's miraculous show ! “ Her trees of tinsel kissed by freakish gales , “ Her Ouphs that , cloaked in leaf-gold , skim the breeze , “ And fairies , swarming — ” TENNANT 'S ANSTER FAIR . I . ‘ Tis the middle watch of a summer 's night — The earth is dark , but the heavens are bright ; Nought is seen in the vault on high But the moon , and the stars , and the cloudless sky , And the flood which rolls its milky hue , A river of light on the welkin blue . The moon looks down on old Cronest , She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast , And seems his huge gray form to throw In a sliver cone on the wave below ; His sides are broken by spots of shade , By the walnut bough and the cedar made , And through their clustering branches dark Glimmers and dies the fire-fly 's spark — Like starry twinkles that momently break Through the rifts of the gathering tempest 's rack . II . The stars are on the moving stream , And fling , as its ripples gently flow , A burnished length of wavy beam In an eel-like , spiral line below ; The winds are whist , and the owl is still , The bat in the shelvy rock is hid , And nought is heard on the lonely hill But the cricket 's chirp , and the answer shrill Of the gauze-winged katy-did ; And the plaint of the wailing whip-poor-will , Who moans unseen , and ceaseless sings , Ever a note of wail and wo , Till morning spreads her rosy wings , And earth and sky in her glances glow . III . ‘ Tis the hour of fairy ban and spell : The wood-tick has kept the minutes well ; He has counted them all with click and stroke , Deep in the heart of the mountain oak , And he has awakened the sentry elve Who sleeps with him in the haunted tree , To bid him ring the hour of twelve , And call the fays to their revelry ; Twelve small strokes on his tinkling bell — ( ‘ Twas made of the white snail 's pearly shell :—) “ Midnight comes , and all is well ! Hither , hither , wing your way ! ‘ Tis the dawn of the fairy day . ” IV . They come from beds of lichen green , They creep from the mullen 's velvet screen ; Some on the backs of beetles fly From the silver tops of moon-touched trees , Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high , And rock 'd about in the evening breeze ; Some from the hum-bird 's downy nest — They had driven him out by elfin power , And pillowed on plumes of his rainbow breast , Had slumbered there till the charmed hour ; Some had lain in the scoop of the rock , With glittering ising-stars inlaid ; And some had opened the four-o'clock , And stole within its purple shade . And now they throng the moonlight glade , Above — below — on every side , Their little minim forms arrayed In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride ! V. They come not now to print the lea , In freak and dance around the tree , Or at the mushroom board to sup , And drink the dew from the buttercup ;— A scene of sorrow waits them now , For an Ouphe has broken his vestal vow ; He has loved an earthly maid , And left for her his woodland shade ; He has lain upon her lip of dew , And sunned him in her eye of blue , Fann 'd her cheek with his wing of air , Played in the ringlets of her hair , And , nestling on her snowy breast , Forgot the lily-king 's behest . For this the shadowy tribes of air To the elfin court must haste away :— And now they stand expectant there , To hear the doom of the Culprit Fay . VI . The throne was reared upon the grass Of spice-wood and of sassafras ; On pillars of mottled tortoise-shell Hung the burnished canopy — And o'er it gorgeous curtains fell Of the tulip 's crimson drapery . The monarch sat on his judgment-seat , On his brow the crown imperial shone , The prisoner Fay was at his feet , And his peers were ranged around the throne . He waved his sceptre in the air , He looked around and calmly spoke ; His brow was grave and his eye severe , But his voice in a softened accent broke : VII . “ Fairy ! Fairy ! list and mark , Thou hast broke thine elfin chain , Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark , And thy wings are dyed with a deadly stain — Thou hast sullied thine elfin purity In the glance of a mortal maiden 's eye , Thou hast scorned our dread decree , And thou shouldst pay the forfeit high , But well I know her sinless mind Is pure as the angel forms above , Gentle and meek , and chaste and kind , Such as a spirit well might love ; Fairy ! had she spot or taint , Bitter had been thy punishment . Tied to the hornet 's shardy wings ; Tossed on the pricks of nettles ’ stings ; Or seven long ages doomed to dwell With the lazy worm in the walnut-shell ; Or every night to writhe and bleed Beneath the tread of the centipede ; Or bound in a cobweb dungeon dim , Your jailer a spider huge and grim , Amid the carrion bodies to lie , Of the worm , and the bug , and the murdered fly : These it had been your lot to bear , Had a stain been found on the earthly fair . Now list , and mark our mild decree — Fairy , this your doom must be : VIII . “ Thou shalt seek the beach of sand Where the water bounds the elfin land , Thou shalt watch the oozy brine Till the sturgeon leaps in the bright moonshine , Then dart the glistening arch below , And catch a drop from his silver bow . The water-sprites will wield their arms And dash around , with roar and rave , And vain are the woodland spirits ’ charms , They are the imps that rule the wave . Yet trust thee in thy single might , If thy heart be pure and thy spirit right , Thou shalt win the warlock fight . IX . “ If the spray-bead gem be won , The stain of thy wing is washed away , But another errand must be done Ere thy crime be lost for aye ; Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark , Thou must re-illume its spark . Mount thy steed and spur him high To the heaven 's blue canopy ; And when thou seest a shooting star , Follow it fast , and follow it far — The last faint spark of its burning train Shall light the elfin lamp again . Thou hast heard our sentence , Fay ; Hence ! to the water-side , away ! ” X . The goblin marked his monarch well ; He spake not , but he bowed him low , Then plucked a crimson colen-bell , And turned him round in act to go . The way is long , he cannot fly , His soiled wing has lost its power , And he winds adown the mountain high , For many a sore and weary hour . Through dreary beds of tangled fern , Through groves of nightshade dark and dern , Over the grass and through the brake , Where toils the ant and sleeps the snake ; Now o'er the violet 's azure flush He skips along in lightsome mood ; And now he thrids the bramble bush , Till its points are dyed in fairy blood . He has leapt the bog , he has pierced the briar , He has swum the brook , and waded the mire , Till his spirits sank , and his limbs grew weak , And the red waxed fainter in his cheek . He had fallen to the ground outright , For rugged and dim was his onward track , But there came a spotted toad in sight , And he laughed as he jumped upon her back ; He bridled her mouth with a silk-weed twist ; He lashed her sides with an osier thong ; And now through evening 's dewy mist , With leap and spring they bound along , Till the mountain 's magic verge is past , And the beach of sand is reached at last . XI . Soft and pale is the moony beam , Moveless still the glassy stream , The wave is clear , the beach is bright With snowy shells and sparkling stones ; The shore-surge comes in ripples light , In murmurings faint and distant moans ; And ever afar in the silence deep Is heard the splash of the sturgeon 's leap , And the bend of his graceful bow is seen — A glittering arch of silver sheen , Spanning the wave of burnished blue , And dripping with gems of the river dew . XII . The elfin cast a glance around , As he lighted down from his courser toad , Then round his breast his wings he wound , And close to the river 's brink he strode ; He sprang on a rock , he breathed a prayer , Above his head his arms he threw , Then tossed a tiny curve in air , And headlong plunged in the waters blue . XIII . Up sprung the spirits of the waves , From sea-silk beds in their coral caves , With snail-plate armour snatched in haste , They speed their way through the liquid waste ; Some are rapidly borne along On the mailed shrimp or the prickly prong , Some on the blood-red leeches glide , Some on the stony star-fish ride , Some on the back of the lancing squab , Some on the sidelong soldier-crab ; And some on the jellied quarl , that flings At once a thousand streamy stings — They cut the wave with the living oar And hurry on to the moonlight shore , To guard their realms and chase away The footsteps of the invading Fay . XIV . Fearlessly he skims along , His hope is high , and his limbs are strong , He spreads his arms like the swallow 's wing , And throws his feet with a frog-like fling ; His locks of gold on the waters shine , At his breast the tiny foam-beads rise , His back gleams bright above the brine , And the wake-line foam behind him lies . But the water-sprites are gathering near To check his course along the tide ; Their warriors come in swift career And hem him round on every side ; On his thigh the leech has fixed his hold , The quarl 's long arms are round him roll 'd , The prickly prong has pierced his skin , And the squab has thrown his javelin , The gritty star has rubbed him raw , And the crab has struck with his giant claw ; He howls with rage , and he shrieks with pain , He strikes around , but his blows are vain ; Hopeless is the unequal fight , Fairy ! nought is left but flight . XV .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>He turned him round and fled amain With hurry and dash to the beach again ; He twisted over from side to side , And laid his cheek to the cleaving tide . The strokes of his plunging arms are fleet , And with all his might he flings his feet , But the water-sprites are round him still , To cross his path and work him ill . They bade the wave before him rise ; They flung the sea-fire in his eyes , And they stunned his ears with the scallop stroke , With the porpoise heave and the drum-fish croak . Oh ! but a weary wight was he When he reached the foot of the dog-wood tree ; — Gashed and wounded , and stiff and sore , He laid him down on the sandy shore ; He blessed the force of the charmed line , And he banned the water-goblin 's spite , For he saw around in the sweet moonshine , Their little wee faces above the brine , Giggling and laughing with all their might At the piteous hap of the Fairy wight . XVI . Soon he gathered the balsam dew From the sorrel leaf and the henbane bud ; Over each wound the balm he drew , And with cobweb lint he stanched the blood . The mild west wind was soft and low , It cooled the heat of his burning brow , And he felt new life in his sinews shoot , As he drank the juice of the cal'mus root ; And now he treads the fatal shore , As fresh and vigorous as before . XVII . Wrapped in musing stands the sprite : ‘ Tis the middle wane of night , His task is hard , his way is far , But he must do his errand right Ere dawning mounts her beamy car , And rolls her chariot wheels of light ; And vain are the spells of fairy-land , He must work with a human hand . XVIII . He cast a saddened look around , But he felt new joy his bosom swell , When , glittering on the shadowed ground , He saw a purple muscle shell ; Thither he ran , and he bent him low , He heaved at the stern and he heaved at the bow , And he pushed her over the yielding sand , Till he came to the verge of the haunted land . She was as lovely a pleasure boat As ever fairy had paddled in , For she glowed with purple paint without , And shone with silvery pearl within ; A sculler 's notch in the stern he made , An oar he shaped of the bootle blade ; Then spung to his seat with a lightsome leap , And launched afar on the calm blue deep . XIX . The imps of the river yell and rave ; They had no power above the wave , But they heaved the billow before the prow , And they dashed the surge against her side , And they struck her keel with jerk and blow , Till the gunwale bent to the rocking tide . She wimpled about in the pale moonbeam , Like a feather that floats on a wind tossed-stream ; And momently athwart her track The quarl upreared his island back , And the fluttering scallop behind would float , And patter the water about the boat ; But he bailed her out with his colen-bell , And he kept her trimmed with a wary tread , While on every side like lightening fell The heavy strokes of his bootle-blade . XX . Onward still he held his way , Till he came where the column of moonshine lay , And saw beneath the surface dim The brown-backed sturgeon slowly swim : Around him were the goblin train — But he sculled with all his might and main , And followed wherever the sturgeon led , Till he saw him upward point his head ; Then he dropped his paddle blade , And held his colen goblet up To catch the drop in its crimson cup . XXI . With sweeping tail and quivering fin , Through the wave the sturgeon flew , And , like the heaven-shot javelin , He sprung above the waters blue . Instant as the star-fall light , He plunged him in the deep again , But left an arch of silver bright The rainbow of the moony main . It was a strange and lovely sight To see the puny goblin there ; He seemed an angel form of light , With azure wing and sunny hair , Throned on a cloud of purple fair , Circled with blue and edged with white , And sitting at the fall of even Beneath the bow of summer heaven . XXII . A moment and its lustre fell , But ere it met the billow blue , He caught within his crimson bell , A droplet of its sparkling dew — Joy to thee , Fay ! thy task is done , Thy wings are pure , for the gem is won — Cheerly ply thy dripping oar , And haste away to the elfin shore . XXIII .</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>He turns , and lo ! on either side The ripples on his path divide ; And the track o'er which his boat must pass Is smooth as a sheet of polished glass . Around , their limbs the sea-nymphs lave , With snowy arms half swelling out , While on the glossed and gleamy wave Their sea-green ringlets loosely float ; They swim around with smile and song ; They press the bark with pearly hand , And gently urge her course along , Toward the beach of speckled sand ; And , as he lightly leapt to land , They bade adieu with nod and bow , Then gayly kissed each little hand , And dropped in the crystal deep below . XXIV . A moment staied the fairy there ; He kissed the beach and breathed a prayer , Then spread his wings of gilded blue , And on to the elfin court he flew ; As ever ye saw a bubble rise , And shine with a thousand changing dyes , Till lessening far through ether driven , It mingles with the hues of heaven : As , at the glimpse of morning pale , The lance-fly spreads his silken sail , And gleams with blendings soft and bright , Till lost in the shades of fading night ; So rose from earth the lovely Fay — So vanished , far in heaven away ! Up , Fairy ! quit thy chick-weed bower , The cricket has called the second hour , Twice again , and the lark will rise To kiss the streaking of the skies — Up ! thy charmed armour don , Thou'lt need it ere the night be gone . XXV . He put his acorn helmet on ; It was plumed of the silk of the thistle down : The corslet plate that guarded his breast Was once the wild bee 's golden vest ; His cloak , of a thousand mingled dyes , Was formed of the wings of butterflies ; His shield was the shell of a lady-bug queen , Studs of gold on a ground of green ; And the quivering lance which he brandished bright , Was the sting of a wasp he had slain in fight . Swift he bestrode his fire-fly steed ; He bared his blade of the bent grass blue ; He drove his spurs of the cockle seed , And away like a glance of thought he flew , To skim the heavens and follow far The fiery trail of the rocket-star . XXVI .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>The moth-fly , as he shot in air , Crept under the leaf , and hid her there ; The katy-did forgot its lay , The prowling gnat fled fast away , The fell mosqueto checked his drone And folded his wings till the Fay was gone , And the wily beetle dropped his head , And fell on the ground as if he were dead ; They crouched them close in the darksome shade , They quaked all o'er with awe and fear , For they had felt the blue-bent blade , And writhed at the prick of the elfin spear ; Many a time on a summer 's night , When the sky was clear and the moon was bright , They had been roused from the haunted ground , By the yelp and bay of the fairy hound ; They had heard the tiny bugle horn , They had heard of twang of the maize-silk string , When the vine-twig bows were tightly drawn , And the nettle-shaft through the air was borne , Feathered with down the hum-bird 's wing . And now they deemed the courier ouphe , Some hunter sprite of the elfin ground ; And they watched till they saw him mount the roof That canopies the world around ; Then glad they left their covert lair , And freaked about in the midnight air . XXVII . Up to the vaulted firmament His path the fire-fly courser bent , And at every gallop on the wind , He flung a glittering spark behind ; He flies like a feather in the blast Till the first light cloud in heaven is past , But the shapes of air have begun their work , And a drizzly mist is round him cast , He cannot see through the mantle murk , He shivers with cold , but he urges fast , Through storm and darkness , sleet and shade , He lashes his steed and spurs amain , For shadowy hands have twitched the rein , And flame-shot tongues around him played , And near him many a fiendish eye Glared with a fell malignity , And yells of rage , and shrieks of fear , Came screaming on his startled ear . XXVIII . His wings are wet around his breast , The plume hangs dripping from his crest , His eyes are blur 'd with the lightning 's glare , And his ears are stunned with the thunder 's blare , But he gave a shout , and his blade he drew , He thrust before and he struck behind , Till he pierced their cloudy bodies through , And gashed their shadowy limbs of wind ; Howling the misty spectres flew , They rend the air with frightful cries , For he has gained the welkin blue , And the land of clouds beneath him lies . XXIX . Up to the cope careering swift In breathless motion fast , Fleet as the swallow cuts the drift , Or the sea-roc rides the blast , The sapphire sheet of eve is shot , The sphered moon is past , The earth but seems a tiny blot On a sheet of azure cast . O ! it was sweet in the clear moonlight , To tread the starry plain of even , To meet the thousand eyes of night , And feel the cooling breath of heaven ! But the Elfin made no stop or stay Till he came to the bank of the milky-way , Then he checked his courser 's foot , And watched for the glimpse of the planet-shoot . XXX . Sudden along the snowy tide That swelled to meet their footstep 's fall , The sylphs of heaven were seen to glide , Attired in sunset 's crimson pall ; Around the Fay they weave the dance , They skip before him on the plain , And one has taken his wasp-sting lance , And one upholds his bridle rein ; With warblings wild they lead him on To where through clouds of amber seen , Studded with stars , resplendent shone The palace of the sylphid queen . Its spiral columns gleaming bright Were streamers of the northern light ; Its curtain 's light and lovely flush Was of the morning 's rosy blush , And the ceiling fair that rose aboon The white and feathery fleece of noon . XXXI . But oh ! how fair the shape that lay Beneath a rainbow bending bright , She seemed to the entranced Fay The loveliest of the forms of light ; Her mantle was the purple rolled At twilight in the west afar ; ‘ Twas tied with threads of dawning gold , And buttoned with a sparkling star . Her face was like the lily roon That veils the vestal planet 's hue ; Her eyes , two beamlets from the moon , Set floating in the welkin blue . Her hair is like the sunny beam , And the diamond gems which round it gleam Are the pure drops of dewy even That ne'er have left their native heaven . XXXII . She raised her eyes to the wondering sprite , And they leapt with smiles , for well I ween Never before in the bowers of light Had the form of an earthly Fay been seen . Long she looked in his tiny face ; Long with his butterfly cloak she played ; She smoothed his wings of azure lace , And handled the tassel of his blade ; And as he told in accents low The story of his love and wo , She felt new pains in her bosom rise , And the tear-drop started in her eyes . And ‘ O sweet spirit of earth , ’ she cried , ‘ Return no more to your woodland height , But ever here with me abide In the land of everlasting light ! Within the fleecy drift we 'll lie , We 'll hang upon the rainbow 's rim ; And all the jewels of the sky Around thy brow shall brightly beam ! And thou shalt bathe thee in the stream That rolls its whitening foam aboon , And ride upon the lightning 's gleam , And dance upon the orbed moon ! We 'll sit within the Pleiad ring , We 'll rest on Orion 's starry belt , And I will bid my sylphs to sing The song that makes the dew-mist melt ; Their harps are of the umber shade , That hides the blush of waking day , And every gleamy string is made Of silvery moonshine 's lengthened ray ; And thou shalt pillow on my breast , While heavenly breathings float around , And , with the sylphs of ether blest , Forget the joys of fairy ground . ’ XXXIII . She was lovely and fair to see And the elfin 's heart beat fitfully ; But lovelier far , and still more fair , The earthly form imprinted there ; Nought he saw in the heavens above Was half so dear as his mortal love , For he thought upon her looks so meek , And he thought of the light flush on her cheek ; Never again might he bask and lie On that sweet cheek and moonlight eye , But in his dreams her form to see , To clasp her in his reverie , To think upon his virgin bride , Was worth all heaven and earth beside . XXXIV . ‘ Lady , ’ he cried , ‘ I have sworn to-night , On the word of a fairy knight , To do my sentence-task aright ; My honour scarce is free from stain , I may not soil its snows again ; Betide me weal , betide me wo , Its mandate must be answered now . ’ Her bosom heaved with many a sigh , The tear was in her drooping eye ; But she led him to the palace gate , And called the sylphs who hovered there , And bade them fly and bring him straight Of clouds condensed a sable car . With charm and spell she blessed it there , From all the fiends of upper air ; Then round him cast the shadowy shroud , And tied his steed behind the cloud ; And pressed his hand as she bade him fly Far to the verge of the northern sky , For by its wane and wavering light There was a star would fall to-night . XXXV . Borne after on the wings of the blast , Northward away , he speeds him fast , And his courser follows the cloudy wain Till the hoof-strokes fall like pattering rain . The clouds roll backward as he flies , Each flickering star behind him lies , And he has reached the northern plain , And backed his fire-fly steed again , Ready to follow in its flight The streaming of the rocket-light . XXXVI . The star is yet in the vault of heaven , But its rocks in the summer gale ; And now ‘ tis fitful and uneven , And now ‘ tis deadly pale ; And now ‘ tis wrapp 'd in sulphur smoke , And quenched is its rayless beam , And now with a rattling thunder-stroke It bursts in flash and flame . As swift as the glance of the arrowy lance That the storm-spirit flings from high , The star-shot flew o'er the welkin blue , As it fell from the sheeted sky . As swift as the wind in its trail behind The elfin gallops along , The fiends of the clouds are bellowing loud , But the sylphid charm is strong ; He gallops unhurt in the shower of fire , While the cloud-fiends fly from the blaze ; He watches each flake till its sparks expire , And rides in the light of its rays . But he drove his steed to the lightning 's speed , And caught a glimmering spark ; Then wheeled around to the fairy ground , And sped through the midnight dark . Ouphe and goblin ! imp and sprite ! Elf of eve ! and starry Fay ! Ye that love the moon 's soft light , Hither — hither wend your way ; Twine ye in the jocund ring , Sing and trip it merrily , Hand to hand , and wing to wing , Round the wild witch-hazel tree . Hail the wanderer again , With dance and song , and lute and lyre , Pure his wing and strong his chain , And doubly bright his fairy fire . Twine ye in an airy round , Brush the dew and print the lea ; Skip and gambol , hop and bound , Round the wild witch-hazel tree . The beetle guards our holy ground , He flies about the haunted place , And if mortal there be found , He hums in his ears and flaps his face ; The leaf-harp sounds our roundelay , The owlet 's eyes our lanterns be ; Thus we sing , and dance and play , Round the wild witch-hazel tree . But hark ! from tower on tree-top high , The sentry elf his call has made , A streak is in the eastern sky , Shapes of moonlight ! flit and fade ! The hill-tops gleam in morning 's spring , The sky-lark shakes his dappled wing , The day-glimpse glimmers on the lawn , The cock has crowed , the Fays are gone .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p>“ You damn me with faint praise . ” I . Yes , faint was my applause and cold my praise , Though soul was glowing in each polished line ; But nobler subjects claim the poet 's lays , A brighter glory waits a muse like thine . Let amorous fools in love-sick measure pine ; Let Strangford whimper on , in fancied pain , And leave to Moore his rose leaves and his vine ; Be thine the task a higher crown to gain , The envied wreath that decks the patriot 's holy strain . II . Yet not in proud triumphal song alone , Or martial ode , or sad sepulchral dirge , There needs no voice to make our glories known ; There needs no voice the warrior 's soul to urge To tread the bounds of nature 's stormy verge ; Columbia still shall win the battle 's prize ; But be it thine to bid her mind emerge To strike her harp , until its soul arise From the neglected shade , where low in dust it lies . III . Are there no scenes to touch the poet 's soul ? No deeds of arms to wake the lordly strain ? Shall Hudson 's billows unregarded roll ? Has Warren fought , Montgomery died in vain ? Shame ! that while every mountain stream and plain Hath theme for truth 's proud voice or fancy 's wand , No native bard the patriot harp hath ta'en , But left to minstrels of a foreign strand To sing the beauteous scenes of nature 's loveliest land . IV . Oh ! for a seat on Appalachia 's brow , That I might scan the glorious prospect round , Wild waving woods , and rolling floods below , Smooth level glades and fields with grain embrown 'd , High heaving hills , with tufted forests crown 'd , Rearing their tall tops to the heaven 's blue dome , And emerald isles , like banners green unwound , Floating along the lake , while round them roam Bright helms of billowy blue and plumes of dancing foam . V. ‘ Tis true no fairies haunt our verdant meads , No grinning imps deform our blazing hearth ; Beneath the kelpie 's fang no traveller bleeds , Nor gory vampyre taints our holy earth , Nor spectres stalk to frighten harmless mirth , Nor tortured demon howls adown the gale ; Fair reason checks these monsters in their birth . Yet have we lay of love and horrid tale Would dim the manliest eye and make the bravest pale . VI . Where is the stony eye that hath not shed Compassion 's heart-drops o'er the sweet Mc Rea ? Through midnight 's wilds by savage bandits led , “ Her heart is sad — her love is far away ! ” Elate that lover waits the promised day When he shall clasp his blooming bride again — Shine on , sweet visions ! dreams of rapture , play ! Soon the cold corse of her he loved in vain Shall blight his withered heart and fire his frenzied brain . VII . Romantic Wyoming ! could none be found Of all that rove thy Eden groves among , To wake a native harp 's untutored sound , And give thy tale of wo the voice of song ? Oh ! if description 's cold and nerveless tongue From stranger harps such hallowed strains could call , How doubly sweet the descant wild had rung , From one who , lingering round thy ruined wall , Had plucked thy mourning flowers and wept thy timeless fall . VIII . The Huron chief escaped from foemen nigh , His frail bark launches on Niagara 's tides , “ Pride in his port , defiance in his eye , ” Singing his song of death the warrior glides ; In vain they yell along the river sides , In vain the arrow from its sheaf is torn , Calm to his doom the willing victim rides , And , till adown the roaring torrent borne , Mocks them with gesture proud , and laughs their rage to scorn . IX . But if the charms of daisied hill and vale , And rolling flood , and towering rock sublime , If warrior deed or peasant 's lowly tale Of love or wo should fail to wake the rhyme , If to the wildest heights of song you climb , ( Tho ’ some who know you less , might cry , beware ! ) Onward ! I say — your strains shall conquer time ; Give your bright genius wing , and hope to share Imagination 's worlds — the ocean , earth , and air . X. Arouse , my friend — let vivid fancy soar , Look with creative eye on nature 's face , Bid airy sprites in wild Niagara roar , And view in every field a fairy race . Spur thy good Pacolet to speed apace , And spread a train of nymphs on every shore ; Or if thy muse would woo a ruder grace , The Indian 's evil Manitou 's explore , And rear the wondrous tale of legendary lore . XI . Away ! to Susquehannah 's utmost springs , Where , throned in mountain mist , Areouski reigns , Shrouding in lurid clouds his plumeless wings , And sternly sorrowing o'er his tribes remains ; His was the arm , like comet ere it wanes That tore the streamy lightnings from the skies , And smote the mammoth of the southern plains ; Wild with dismay the Creek affrighted flies , While in triumphant pride Kanawa 's eagles rise . XII . Or westward far , where dark Miami wends , Seek that fair spot as yet to fame unknown ; Where , when the vesper dew of heaven descends , Soft music breathes in many a melting tone , At times so sadly sweet it seems the moan Of some poor Ariel penanced in the rock ; Anon a louder burst — a scream ! a groan ! And now amid the tempest 's reeling shock , Gibber , and shriek , and wail — and fiend-like laugh and mock . XIII . Or climb the Pallisado 's lofty brows , Were dark Omana waged the war of hell , Till , waked to wrath , the mighty spirit rose And pent the demons in their prison cell ; Full on their head the uprooted mountain fell , Enclosing all within its horrid womb Straight from the teeming earth the waters swell , And pillared rocks arise in cheerless gloom Around the drear abode — their last eternal tomb ! XIV . Be these your future themes — no more resign The soul of song to laud your lady 's eyes ; Go ! kneel a worshipper at nature 's shrine ! For you her fields are green , and fair her skies ! For you her rivers flow , her hills arise ! And will you scorn them all , to pour forth tame And heartless lays of feigned or fancied sighs ? Still will you cloud the muse ? nor blush for shame To cast away renown , and hide your head from fame ? EXTRACTS FROM LEON . AN UNFINISHED POEM . It is a summer evening , calm and fair , A warm , yet freshening glow is in the air ; Along its bank , the cool stream wanders slow , Like parting friends that linger as they go . The willows , as its waters meekly glide , Bend their dishevelled tresses to the tide , And seem to give it , with a moaning sigh , A farewell touch of tearful sympathy . Each dusky copse is clad in darkest green : A blackening mass , just edged with silver sheen From yon clear moon , who in her glassy face Seems to reflect the risings of the place . For on her still , pale orb , the eye may see Dim spots of shadowy brown , like distant tree Or far-off hillocks on a moonlight lea . The stars have lit in heaven their lamps of gold , The viewless dew falls lightly on the wold , The gentle air , that softly sweeps the leaves , A strain of faint , unearthly music weaves ; As when the harp of heaven remotely plays , Or cygnet 's wail — or song of sorrowing fays That float amid the moonshine glimmerings pale , On wings of woven air in some enchanted vale . It is an eve that drops a heavenly balm , To lull the feelings to a sober calm , To bid wild passion 's fiery flush depart ; And smooth the troubled waters of the heart ; To give a tranquil fixedness to grief , A cherished gloom , that wishes not relief . Torn is that heart , and bitter are its throes , That cannot feel on such a night , repose ; And yet one breast there is that breathes this air , An eye that wanders o'er the prospect fair , That sees yon placid moon , and the pure sky Of mild , unclouded blue ; and still that eye Is thrown in restless vacancy around , Or cast , in gloomy trance , on the cold ground ; And still , that breast with maddening passion burns , And hatred , love , and sorrow , rule by turns . A lovely figure ! and in happier hour , When pleasure laugh 'd abroad from hall and bower , The general eye had deem 'd her smiling face The brightest jewel in the courtly place : So glossy is her hair 's ensabled wreath , So glowing warm the eye that burns beneath With so much graceful sweetness of address , And such a form of rounded slenderness ; Ah ! where is he on whom these beauties shine , But deems a spotless soul inhabits such a shrine ? And yet a keen observer might espy Strange passions lurking in her deep black eye , And in the lines of her fine lip , a soul That in its every feeling spurned control . They passed unnoted — who will stop to trace A sullying spot on beauty 's sparkling face ? And no one deemed , amid her glances sweet , Hers was a bosom of impetuous heat ; A heart too wildly in its joys elate , Formed but to madly love — or madly hate ; A spirit of strong throbs , and steadfast will ; To doat , detest , to die for , or to kill ; Which , like the Arab chief , would fiercely dare To stab the heart she might no longer share ; And yet so tender , if he loved again , Would die to save his breast one moment 's pain . But he who cast his gaze upon her now , And read the traces written on her brow , Had scarce believed hers was that form of light That beamed like fabled wonder on the sight ; Her raven hair hung down in loosen 'd tress Before her wan cheek 's pallid ghastliness ; And , thro ’ its thick locks , showed the deadly white , Like marble glimpses of a tomb , at night . In fixed and horrid musings now she stands , Her eyes now bent to earth , and her cold hands , Prest to her heart , now wildly thrown on high , They wander o'er her brow — and now a sigh Breaks deep and full — and , more composedly , She half exclaims — “ No ! no !— it cannot be ; “ He loves not , never loved — not even when “ He pressed my wedded hand — I knew it then ; “ And yet — fool that I was — I saw he strove “ In vain to kindle pity into love . “ But Florence ! she so loved — a sister too ! “ My earliest , dearest playmate — one who grew “ Upon my very heart — to rend it so ! “ His falsehood I could bear — but hers ! ah ! no . “ She is not false — I feel she loves me yet , “ And if my boding bosom could forget “ Its wild imaginings , with what sweet pain “ I 'd clasp my Florence to my breast again . ” With that came many a thought of days gone by , Remembered joys of mirthful infancy ; And youth 's gay frolic , and the short-lived flow Of showering tears , in childhood 's fleeting wo , And life 's maturer friendship — and the sense Of heart-warm , open , fearless confidence ; All these came thronging with a tender call , And her own Florence mingled with them all . And softened feelings rose amid her pain , While from her eyes , the clouds , melted in gentle rain . A hectic pleasure flushed her faded face ; It fled — and deeper paleness took its place ; Then a cold shudder thrill 'd her — and , at last , Her lip a smile of bitter sarcasm cast , As if she scorned herself , that she could be A moment lulled by that sweet sophistry ; For in that little minute memory 's sting Gave word and look , sigh , gesture — every thing , To bid these dear delusive phantoms fly , And fix her fears in dreadful certainty . It traced the very progress of their love , From the first meeting in the locust grove ; When from the chase Leon came bounding there , Backing his courser with a noble air ; His brown cheek flushed with healthful exercise , And his warm spirits leaping in his eyes ; It told how lovely looked her sister then , To long-lost friends , and home just come again ; How on her cheek the tears of meeting lay , That tear which only feeling hearts can pay ; While the quick pleasure glistened in her eye , Like clouds and sunshine in an April sky ; And then it told , as their acquaintance grew , How close the unseen bonds of union drew Their souls together , and how pleased they were The same blythe pastimes and delights to share ; How the same chord in each at once would strike , Their taste , their wishes , and their joys alike . All this was innocent , but soon there came Blushes and starts of consciousness and shame ; That , when she entered , upon either cheek The hasty blood in guilty red would speak Of something that should not be known — and still Sighs half suppressed seemed struggling with the will . It told how oft at eve was Leon gone In moody wandering to the wood alone ; And in the night , how many a broken dream Of bliss , or terror , seemed to shake his frame . How Florence too , in long abstracted fit Of soul-wrapt musing , for whole hours would sit ; Nor even the power of music , friend , or book , Could chase her deep forgetfulness of look ; And how , when questioned — with an indrawn sigh , In vague and far-off phrase , she made reply , And smiled and struggled to be gay and free , And then relapsed in dreaming reverie . How when of Leon she was forced to speak , Unbidden crimson mantled in her cheek ; And when he entered , how her eye would swim , And strive to look on every one but him ; Yet , by unconscious fascination led , In quick short glance each moment tow'rds him fled . How he , too , seemed to shun her speech and gaze , And yet he always lingered where she was ; Though nothing in his aspect or his air Told that he knew she was in presence there ; But an appearance of constrained distress , And a dull tongue of moveless silentness , And a down drooping eye of gloom and sadness , Oh ! how unlike his former face of gladness . “ ‘ Tis plain ! too plain ! and I am lost , ” she cried ; And in that thought her last good feeling died . That thought of hopeless sorrow seemed to dart A thousand stings at once into her heart ; But a strong effort quelled it , and she gave The next to hatred , vengeance , and the grave . Her face was calmly stern , and but a glare Within her eyes — there was no feature there That told what lashing fiends her inmates were ; Within — there was no thought to bid her swerve From her intent — but every strained nerve Was settled and bent up with terrible force , To some deep deed , far , far beyond remorse ; No glimpse of mercy 's light her purpose crost , Love , nature , pity , in its depths were lost ; Or lent an added fury to the ire That seared her soul with unconsuming fire ; All that was dear in the wide earth was gone , She loved but two , and these she doted on With passionate ardour — and the close strong press Of woman 's heart-cored , clinging tenderness ; These links were torn , and now she stood alone , Bereft of all , her husband , sister — gone ! Ah ! who can tell that ne'er has known such fate , What wild and dreadful strength it gives to hate ? What had she left ? Revenge ! Revenge ! was there ; He crushed remorse and wrestled down despair : Held his red torch to memory 's page , and threw A bloody stain on every line she drew ; She felt dark pleasure with her frenzy blend , And hugged him to her heart , and called him friend . When sorrowing clouds the face of heaven deform , And hope 's bright star sets darkly in the storm , Around us ghastly shapes and phantoms swim , And all beyond is formless , vague , and dim , Or life 's cold barren path before us lies , A wild and weary waste of tears and sighs ; From the lorn heart each sweetening solace gone , Abandoned , friendless , withered , lost , and lone ; And when with keener pangs we bleed to know That hands beloved have struck the deepest blow ; That friends we deemed most true , and held most dear , Have stretched the pall of death o'er pleasure 's bier ; Repaid our trusting faith with serpent guile , Cursed with a kiss , and stabbed beneath a smile ; What then remains for souls of tender mould ? One last and silent refuge , calm and cold — A resting place for misery 's gentle slave ; Hearts break but once , no wrongs can reach the grave . Rest ye , mild spirits of afflicted worth ! Sweet is your slumber in the quiet earth ; And soon the voice of heaven shall bid you rise To meet rewarding smiles in yonder skies . But where , for solace , shall the bosom turn For death too strong — for tears — too proudly stern ? When shall the lulling dews of peace descend On hearts that cannot break and will not bend ? Ah ! never , never — they are doomed to feel Pains that no balm of heaven or earth can heal ; To live in groans , and yield their parting breath Without a joy in life — or hope in death . Yet , for a while , one living hope remains , That nerves each fibre and the soul sustains ; One desperate hope , whose agonizing throes Are bitterer far than all the worst of woes ; A hope of crime and horrors , wild and strange As demon thoughts — that hope is thine , Revenge ! ‘ Twas this that gave , oh ! Ellinor , to thee A strength to bear thy matchless misery : Though the hot blood ran boiling in her brain , And rolled a tide of fire through every vein , Though many a rushing voice of blighted bliss Struck on her mental ears , like adders ’ hiss ; That hope gave gloomy fierceness to her eye , Dash 'd down the tear , repress 'd the unloading sigh ; Fixed her wan quivering lip , and steeled her breast To crush the hearts that robbed her own of rest . She wound her way within a heavy shade Of arching boughs , in broad-spread leaves arrayed ; Which , clustering close and thick , shut out the light , And tinged with black the shadowy robe of night ; Save here and there a melancholy spark Of flickering moonshine glimmered through the dark , Cheerless and dim , as when upon a pall , Through suffering tears , the looks of sorrow fall ; But opening farther on , on either side A wider space the severing trees divide ; And longer gleams upon the pathway meet , And the soft grass is wet beneath her feet . And now emerging from the darksome shade , She pressed the silken carpet of the glade . Beyond the green , within its western close , A little vine-hung , leafy arbor rose , Where the pale lustre of the moony flood Dimm 'd the vermillion 'd woodbine 's scarlet bud ; And glancing through the foliage fluttering round , In tiny circles gemm 'd the freckled ground . Beside the porch , beneath the friendly screen Of two tall trees , a mossy bank was seen ; And all around , amid the silvery dew , The wild-wood pansy rear 'd her petals blue ; And gold cups and the meadow cowslip red , Upon the evening air their odours shed . Unheeded all the grove 's deep gloom had been , Unseen the moonlight brightness of the green ; In vain the stream 's blue burnish met her eye , Lovely its wave , but pass 'd unnoticed by : The airs of heaven had breath 'd around her brow Their cooling sighs — she felt them not — but now That lonely bower appeared , and with a start Convulsive shudders thrill 'd her throbbing heart . For there , in days , alas ! for ever gone , When love 's young torch with beams of rapture shone , When she had felt her heart 's impassioned swell , And almost deem 'd her Leon loved as well ; There had she sat , beneath the evening skies , Felt his warm kiss and heard his murmur 'd sighs ; Hung on his breast , caressing and carest , Her husband smiled , and Ellinor was blest . And when his injured country 's rights to shield , Blazed his red banner on the battle field , There had she lingered in the shadows dim , And sat till morning watch and thought of him ; And wept to think that she might not be there , His toils , his dangers , and his wounds to share . And when the foe had bowed beneath his brand , And to his home he led his conquering band , There she first caught his long-expected face , And sprung to smile and weep in his embrace . These scenes of bliss across her memory fled , Like lights that haunt the chambers of the dead , She saw the bower , and read the image there Of joys that had been , and of woes that were ; She clench 'd her hand in agony , and cast A glance of tears upon it as she past , A look of weeping sorrow — ‘ twas the last ! She check 'd the gush of feeling , turned her face , And faster sped along her hurried pace . No longer now from Leon 's lips were heard The sigh of bliss — the rapture breathing word ; No longer now upon his features dwelt The glance that sweetly thrills — the looks that melt ; No speaking gaze of fond attachment told , But all was dull and gloomy , sad and cold . Yet he was kind , or laboured to be kind , And strove to hide the workings of his mind ; And cloak 'd his heart , to soothe his wife 's distress , Under a mask of tender gentleness . It was in vain — for ah ! how light and frail To love 's keen eye is falsehood 's gilded veil . Sweet winning words may for a time beguile , Professions lull , and oaths deceive a while ; But soon the heart , in vague suspicion tost , Must feel a void unfilled , a something lost ; Something scarce heeded , and unprized till gone , Felt while unseen , and , tho ’ unnoticed , known : A hidden witchery , a nameless charm , Too fine for actions and for words too warm ; That passing all the worthless forms of art , Eludes the sense , and only woos the heart : A hallowed spell , by fond affection wove , The mute , but matchless eloquence of love ! Oh ! there were times , when to my heart there came All that the soul can feel , or fancy frame ; The summer party in the open air , When sunny eyes and cordial hearts were there ; Where light came sparkling thro ’ the greenwood eaves , Like mirthful eyes that laugh upon the leaves ; Where every bush and tree in all the scene , In wind-kiss 'd wavings shake their wings of green , And all the objects round about dispense Reviving freshness to the awakened sense ; The golden corslet of the humble bee , The antic kid that frolics round the lea ; Or purple lance-flies circling round the place , On their light shards of green , an airy race ; Or squirrel glancing from the nut-wood shade An arch black eye , half pleas 'd and half afraid ; Or bird quick darting through the foliage dim , Or perched and twittering on the tendril slim ; Or poised in ether sailing slowly on , With plumes that change and glisten in the sun , Like rainbows fading into mist — and then , On the bright cloud renewed and changed again ; Or soaring upward , while his full sweet throat Pours clear and strong a pleasure-speaking note ; And sings in nature 's language wild and free , His song of praise for light and liberty . And when within , with poetry and song , Music and books led the glad hours along ; Worlds of the visioned minstrel , fancy-wove , Tales of old time , of chivalry and love ; Or converse calm , or wit-shafts sprinkled round , Like beams from gems , too light and fine to wound ; With spirits sparkling as the morning 's sun , Light as the dancing wave he smiles upon , Like his own course — alas ! too soon to know Bright suns may set in storms , and gay hearts sink in wo . NIAGARA . I. Roar , raging torrent ! and thou , mighty river , Pour thy white foam on the valley below ; Frown , ye dark mountains ! and shadow for ever The deep rocky bed where the wild rapids flow . The green sunny glade , and the smooth flowing fountain , Brighten the home of the coward and slave ; The flood and the forest , the rock and the mountain , Rear on their bosoms the free and the brave . II . Nurslings of nature , I mark your bold bearing , Pride in each aspect and strength in each form , Hearts of warm impulse , and souls of high daring , Born in the battle and rear 'd in the storm . The red levin flash and the thunder 's dread rattle , The rock-riven wave and the war trumpet 's breath , The din of the tempest , the yell of the battle , Nerve your steeled bosoms to danger and death . III . High on the brow of the Alps ’ snowy towers The mountain Swiss measures his rock-breasted moors , O'er his lone cottage the avalanche lowers , Round its rude portal the spring-torrent pours . Sweet is his sleep amid peril and danger , Warm is his greeting to kindred and friends , Open his hand to the poor and the stranger , Stern on his foeman his sabre descends . IV . Lo ! where the tempest the dark waters sunder Slumbers the sailor boy , reckless and brave , Warm 'd by the lighting and lulled by the thunder , Fann 'd by the whirlwind and rock 'd on the wave ; Wildly the winter wind howls round his pillow , Cold on his bosom the spray showers fall ; Creaks the strained mast at the rush of the billow , Peaceful he slumbers , regardless of all . V. Mark how the cheek of the warrior flushes , As the battle drum beats and the war torches glare ; Like a blast of the north to the onset he rushes , And his wide-waving falchion gleams brightly in air . Around him the death-shot of foemen are flying , At his feet friends and comrades are yielding their breath ; He strikes to the groans of the wounded and dying , But the war cry he strikes with is , ‘ conquest or death ! ’ VI . Then pour thy broad wave like a flood from the heavens , Each son that thou rearest , in the battle 's wild shock , When the death-speaking note of the trumpet is given , Will charge like thy torrent or stand like thy rock . Let his roof be the cloud and the rock be his pillow , Let him stride the rough mountain , or toss on the foam , He will strike fast and well on the field or the billow , In triumph and glory , for God and his home ! SONG . Oh ! go to sleep , my baby dear , And I will hold thee on my knee ; Thy mother 's in her winding sheet , And thou art all that 's left to me . My hairs are white with grief and age , I 've borne the weight of every ill , And I would lay me with my child , But thou art left to love me still . Should thy false father see thy face , The tears would fill his cruel e'e , But he has scorned thy mother 's wo , And he shall never look on thee : But I will rear thee up alone , And with me thou shalt aye remain ; For thou wilt have thy mother 's smile , And I shall see my child again . SONG . Oh the tear is in my eye , and my heart it is breaking , Thou hast fled from me , Connor , and left me forsaken ; Bright and warm was our morning , but soon has it faded , For I gave thee a true heart , and thou hast betrayed it . Thy footsteps I followed in darkness and danger , From the home of my love to the land of the stranger ; Thou wert mine through the tempest , the blight , and the burning ; Could I think thou wouldst change when the morn was returning . Yet peace to thy heart , though from mine it must sever , May she love thee as I loved , alone and for ever ; I may weep for thy loss , but my faith is unshaken , And the heart thou hast widowed will bless thee in breaking . WRITTEN IN A LADY 'S ALBUM . Grant me , I cried , some spell of art , To turn with all a lover 's care , That spotless page , my Eva 's heart , And write my burning wishes there . But Love , by faithless Laia taught How frail is woman 's holiest vow , Look 'd down , while grace attempered thought Sate serious on his baby brow . “ Go ! blot her album , ” cried the sage , “ There none but bards a place may claim ; But woman 's heart 's a worthless page , Where every fool may write his name . ” Until by time or fate decayed , That line and leaf shall never part ; Ah ! who can tell how soon shall fade The lines of love from woman 's heart .</p>
