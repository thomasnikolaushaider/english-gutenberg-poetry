    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Those friends who have taken an interest in my literary productions may feel some surprise at my appearance in the character of a translator of Sanscrit poetry . To those , and indeed to all who may take up the present volume , I owe some explanation of my pretensions as a faithful interpreter of my original text . Those pretensions are very humble ; and I can unfeignedly say , that if the field had been likely to be occupied by others , who might unite poetical powers with a profound knowledge of the sacred language of India , I should have withdrawn at once from the competition . But , in fact , in this country the students of oriental literature , endowed with a taste and feeling for poetry , are so few in number , that any attempt to make known the peculiar character of those remarkable works , the old mythological epics of India , may be received with indulgence by all who are interested in the history of poetry . Mr. Wilson alone , since Sir W. Jones , has united a poetical genius with deep Sanscrit scholarship ; but he has in general preferred the later and more polished period — that of Kalidasa and the dramatists — to the ruder , yet in my opinion , not less curious and poetical strains of the older epic bards .</p>
    <p n="2">A brief account of the manner in which I became engaged in these studies , will best explain the extent of my proficiency . During the two last years in which I held the office of Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford , having exhausted the subject which I had chosen for my terminal course , I was at a loss for some materials for the few remaining lectures before my office should expire . I had been led by the ardent curiosity , which I have ever felt to acquire some knowledge of the poetry of all ages and nations — to examine some of the publications of French and German , as well as English scholars , on the subject of Indian poetry ; chiefly those of the Schlegels , of Bopp , and of De Chezy . I was struck with the singularity and captivated by the extreme beauty , as it appeared to me , of some of the extracts , especially those from the great epic poems , the Mahabharata and the Ramayana , in their Homeric simplicity so totally opposite to the ordinary notions entertained of all eastern poetry . I was induced to attempt , without any instruction , and with the few elementary works which could be procured , the Grammars of Wilkins and Bopp , the Glossaries of Bopp and Rosen ( Mr. Wilson 's Dictionary was then out of print and could not be purchased ) , to obtain some knowledge of this wonderful and mysterious language . The study grew upon me , and would have been pursued with more ardour , perhaps with more success , but for the constant interruption of more imperative professional and literary avocations . In itself the Sanscrit is an inexhaustible subject of interest ; in its grammatical structure more regular , artificial , and copious than the most perfect of the western languages ; in its origin , the parent from which the older Greek , the Latin and the Teutonic tongues seem to branch out and develop themselves upon distinct and discernible principles .</p>
    <p n="3">I ventured to communicate to the Members of the University who attended my lectures , my discoveries , as it were , in the unknown region of Indian poetry , and to introduce translations of such passages as appeared to me of peculiar singularity or beauty . Though I was still moving in the leading-strings of my learned guides , I had obtained sufficient acquaintance with the language to compare their interpretations with the original text . I afterwards embodied some parts of my lectures in an article in the Quarterly Review , in order to contribute as far as was in my power to open this new and almost untrodden field of literature to the English reader .</p>
    <p n="4">Still I should not have presumed to form these translations into a separate work , nor acceded to the proposal of the publisher of the present volume , who has himself deserved so well of the students of oriental lore by his excellent translation , or rather recomposition of Adelung 's “ Historical Sketch of Sanscrit Literature , ” but for the encouragement and assistance of Mr. Wilson , now , the University may be proud to say , the Boden Professor of Sanscrit at Oxford . To his most friendly care in revising these sheets , I owe the correction of many errors ; and Sanscrit scholars will find in the notes some observations on the text , which will contribute to elucidate the poem of Nala . Under the sanction of Mr. Wilson 's revision , I may venture to hope that the translation is , at least , an accurate version of the original ; and I cannot too strongly express my gratitude for the labour which Mr. Wilson has been so kind as to expend on my imperfect and unpretending work .</p>
    <p n="5">The versification , or rather the metrical system , which I have adopted , is an experiment , how far a successful one must be judged by others . The original verse in which the vast epics of Vyasa and Valmiki are composed is called the Sloka , which is thus described by Schlegel in his Indische Bibliothek , p. 36 : “ The oldest , most simple , and most generally adopted measure is the Sloka ; a distich of two sixteen syllable-lines , divided at the eighth syllable . ” According to our prosodial marks , the following is the scheme :—</p>
    <p n="6">u u u u | u -  -  -  | u u u u | u -  u -  -  -  -  -  | u | -  -  -  -  | u</p>
    <p n="7">u u u u | u -  -  -  | u u u u | u -  u u -  -  -  -  | -  u | -  -  -  -  | -</p>
    <p n="8">The first four syllables are bound by no rule ; the second half , on the contrary , is unalterably fixed , excepting that the last syllable has the common licence of termination . In the second half verse , I do not remember a single instance of deviation from this , though sometimes , but very seldom , the first half verse ends with another quadrisyllable foot . The reader who is curious on the subject , may compare Mr. Colebrooke 's elaborate essays on Sanscrit poetry , Kosegarten 's preface to his Translation of Nala , and Bopp 's preface to his Translation of Selections from the Mahabharata .</p>
    <p n="9">In the first translations which I attempted , a few passages from the Bhagavat-Gita , I adhered as nearly as possible to the measure of the original ; in the Nala , in order to give the narrative a more easy and trochaic flow , I omitted one syllable , and in some degree changed the structure of the verse .</p>

    <docImprint>The episode of Nala is extracted from the Vanaparvam , the third part of the Mahabharata , the great Indian poem , which contains 100 , 000 slokas , or distichs . The sage , Vrihadasva , relates the story of Nala to king Yudishthira , in order to console him under the miseries to which he was exposed by bad success in play . By the terms of the gaming transaction , in which he was worsted by Sakuni , who threw the dice for Duryodhana , he was condemned to wander with his brothers for twelve years in the forest . The adventures of Nala showed how that king , having been in the same manner unfortunate with the dice , had suffered still greater toil and misery , and had at length recovered his kingdom and his wife . The popularity of this fable with the natives , is sufficiently proved by the numerous poetic versions of the story . The Nalodaya , a poem ascribed to Kalidas , should first be mentioned . A new edition of this work has been recently published by Ferdinand Benary ; we have a notice of it in the Quarterly Review : it seems to bear the same relation to the simple and national episode of the Mahabharata , as the seicentesti of<country>Italy</country>to Dante or Arìosto , or Gongora to the poem of the Cid . Another poem called Naishadha , in twenty-two books , does not complete the story , but only carries it as far as the fifteenth book . There is a Tamulic version of the same story , translated by Kindersley , in his specimens of Hindu Literature . The third book of the poem of Sriharsha , containing 135 slokas , is entirely occupied with the conversation between Damayanti and the swans ( the geese ) , in which the birds to excite her love , dwell with diffuse eloquence on the praises of Nala .</docImprint>

     <l n="11">Many an holy act , on offspring<span corresp="#note9" type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>— still intent , had he performed .</l>
     <l n="12">To his court there came a Brahmin ,— Damana the seer was named .</l>
     <l n="13">Him the child-desiring Bhima — in all duties skilled , received ,</l>
     <l n="14">Feasted with his royal consort — in his hospitable hall .<span corresp="#note10" type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></l>

     <l n="32">All around Vidarbha 's princess — praised they Nala in their joy .</l>
     <l n="33">Ever praised they Damayanti — round Nishadha 's noble king .</l>
     <l n="34">Hearing so each others virtues — all unseen they ‘ gan to love .</l>
     <l n="35">Thus of each , O son of Kunti ,<span corresp="#note17" type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>— the deep silent passion grew .</l>
     <l n="36">Nala , in his heart impatient — longer that deep love to bear ,</l>
     <l n="37">To the grove , in secret , wandered — by the palace ’ inmost court .</l>
     <l n="38">There the swans he saw disporting<span corresp="#note18" type="note_anchor">[ 18 ]</span>— with their wings bedropped with gold :</l>
     <l n="39">Through the grove thus lightly moving — one of these bright birds he caught .</l>
     <l n="40">But the bird , in human language — thus the wondering king addressed :</l>
     <l n="41">“ Slay me not , O gentle monarch !— I will do thee service true ;</l>
     <l n="42">So in Damayanti 's presence — will I praise Nishadha 's king ,</l>
     <l n="43">Never after shall the maiden — think of mortal man but thee . ”</l>
     <l n="44">Thus addressed , at once the monarch — let the bright-winged bird depart .</l>
     <l n="45">Flew away the swans rejoicing — to Vidarbha straight they flew ;</l>
     <l n="46">To Vidharba 's stately city :— there by Damayanti 's feet ,</l>
     <l n="47">Down with drooping plumes they settled — and she gazed upon the flock ,</l>
     <l n="48">Wondering at their forms so graceful — where amid her maids she sate .</l>
     <l n="49">Sportively began the damsels — all around to chase the birds ;</l>
     <l n="50">Scattering flew the swans before them — all about the lovely grove .</l>
     <l n="51">Lightly ran the nimble maidens ,— every one her bird pursued ;</l>
     <l n="52">But the swan that through the forest — gentle Damayanti chased ,</l>
     <l n="53">Suddenly , in human language — spake to Damayanti thus .—</l>
     <l n="54">“ Damayanti , in Nishadha — Nala dwells , the noble king —</l>
     <l n="55">Like the Aswinas in beauty ,<span corresp="#note19" type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>— peerless among men is he .</l>
     <l n="56">O incomparable princess — to this hero wert thou wed ,</l>
     <l n="57">Noble birth and perfect beauty — not unworthy fruit had borne .</l>
     <l n="58">Gods , Gandharvas ,<span corresp="#note20" type="note_anchor">[ 20 ]</span>men , the Serpents ,<span corresp="#note21" type="note_anchor">[ 21 ]</span>— and the Rakshasas<span corresp="#note22" type="note_anchor">[ 22 ]</span>we 've</l>
     <l n="59">seen ,</l>
     <l n="60">All we 've seen — of noble Nala — never have we seen the peer .</l>
     <l n="61">Pearl art thou among all women — Nala is the pride of men .</l>
     <l n="62">If the peerless wed the peerless — blessed must the union be . ”</l>
     <l n="63">When the bird thus strangely speaking — gentle Damayanti heard ,</l>
     <l n="64">Answered thus the wondering maiden — “ Thus to Nala , speak thou too . ”</l>
     <l n="65">“ Be it so , ” replied the egg-born — to Vidarbha 's beauteous maid .</l>
     <l n="66">Home then flew he to Nishadha — and to Nala told it all .</l>

     <l n="3">Lost in thought she sate dejected — pale her melancholy cheek ,</l>
     <l n="4">Damayanti sate and yielded — all her soul to sighs of grief .</l>
     <l n="5">Upward gazing , meditative — with a wild distracted look ,</l>
     <l n="6">Wan was all her soft complexion — and with passion heart-possessed ,<span corresp="#note23" type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span></l>
     <l n="7">Nor in sleep nor gentle converse — nor in banquets found she joy ;</l>

     <l n="19">Damayanti 's Swayembara — soon as heard the kings of men ,</l>
     <l n="20">All obeyed king Bhima 's summons — all to Bhima 's court drew near ;</l>

     <l n="50">Of the immortals all , the highest — stood before the king of gods .</l>
     <l n="51">As they all stood silent hearing — Narada 's majestic speech ,</l>
     <l n="52">All exclaimed in sudden rapture — thither we likewise will go ;</l>
     <l n="53">All the immortals on the instant ,— with their chariots , with their hosts ,</l>
     <l n="54">Hastened down towards Vidarbha — where the lords of earth were met .</l>

     <l n="56">Set he forth , with soul all sanguine — full of Damayanti 's love .</l>
     <l n="57">Saw the gods , king Nala standing — on the surface of the earth ;</l>
     <l n="58">Standing in transcendent beauty — equal to the god of love .<span corresp="#note34" type="note_anchor">[ 34 ]</span></l>
     <l n="59">Him beheld the world 's high guardians — in his radiance like the sun ;</l>
     <l n="60">Each arrested stood and silent — at his peerless form amazed .</l>
     <l n="61">All their chariots the celestials — in the midway air have checked .</l>
     <l n="62">Through the blue air then descending — they Nishadha 's king address .</l>
     <l n="63">Ho ! what , ho ! Nishadha 's monarch — Nala , king , for truth renowned ;</l>
     <l n="64">Do our bidding , bear our message — O , most excellent of men .</l>

     <l n="1">Nala made his solemn promise ,— “ all your bidding will I do ; ”</l>
     <l n="2">Then with folded hands adoring — humbly of their will enquired .</l>
     <l n="3">“ Who are ye ? to whom must Nala — as your welcome herald go ?</l>
     <l n="4">What is my commanded service ?— tell me , mighty gods , the truth . ”</l>
     <l n="5">Spake the sovereign of Nishadha — Indra answered thus and said :—</l>
     <l n="6">“ Know us , the Immortals , hither — come for Damayanti 's love .</l>
     <l n="7">Indra I , and yon is Agni ,— and the king of waters there —</l>
     <l n="8">Slayer he of mortal bodies ,— Yama , too , is here , O king !</l>
     <l n="9">Thou , O Nala , of our coming ,— must to Damayanti tell :</l>
     <l n="10">Thee to see , the world 's dread guardians — Indra and the rest came down ,</l>
     <l n="11">Indra , Agni , Varun , Yama ,— each to seek thine hand are come .</l>
     <l n="12">One of these celestial beings ,— choose , O maiden , for thy lord . ”</l>
     <l n="13">Nala , thus addressed by Indra — with his folded hands replied :</l>
     <l n="14">“ Thus with one accord commanding — on this mission send not me .</l>
     <l n="15">How can man , himself enamoured — for another plead his cause ?</l>
     <l n="16">Spare me then , ye gods , in mercy — this unwelcome service , spare . ”</l>

     <l n="18">“ I will do your bidding freely — thus thou'st said , Nishadha 's king ;</l>
     <l n="19">Wilt thou now belie thy promise ?— Nala , go , nor more delay . ”</l>
     <l n="20">By the gods adjured so sternly — thus rejoined Nishadha 's king —</l>
     <l n="21">“ Strictly guarded is yon palace — how may I find entrance there ? ”</l>
     <l n="22">“ Thou shalt enter ; ” thus did Indra — to the unwilling king reply .</l>
     <l n="23">In the bower of Damayanti — as they spake , king Nala stood .</l>
     <l n="24">There he saw Vidarbha 's maiden — girt with all her virgin bands ;</l>
     <l n="25">In her glowing beauty shining — all excelling in her form ;</l>
     <l n="26">Every limb in smooth proportion — slender waist and lovely eyes ;</l>
     <l n="27">Even the moon 's soft gleam disdaining — in her own o'erpowering light .</l>
     <l n="28">As he gazed , his love grew warmer — to the softly smiling maid ,</l>
     <l n="29">Yet to keep his truth , his duty — all his passion he suppressed .</l>
     <l n="30">Then Nishadha 's king beholding — all those maids with beauteous limbs</l>
     <l n="31">From their seats sprang up in wonder — at his matchless form amazed .</l>
     <l n="32">In their rapture to king Nala — all admiring , homage paid ;</l>
     <l n="33">Yet , not venturing to accost him ,— in their secret souls adored .</l>
     <l n="34">“ Oh the beauty ! oh the splendour !— oh the mighty hero 's strength !</l>
     <l n="35">Who is he , or God , or Yaksha — or Gandharba may he be . ”</l>
     <l n="36">Not one single word to utter ,— dared that fair-limbed maiden band ;</l>
     <l n="37">All struck dumb before his beauty — in their bashful silence stood .</l>
     <l n="38">Smiling , first , upon the monarch — as on her he gently smiled ,</l>
     <l n="39">Damayanti , in her wonder — to the hero Nala spake :—</l>
     <l n="40">“ Who art thou of form so beauteous — thou that wakenest all my love ;</l>
     <l n="41">Cam'st thou here like an immortal — I would know thee , sinless chief .</l>
     <l n="42">How hast entered in our palace ?— how hast entered all unseen ?</l>
     <l n="43">Watchful are our chamber wardens — stern the mandate of the king . ”</l>
     <l n="44">By the maiden of Vidarbha — Nala thus addressed , replied :—</l>
     <l n="45">“ Know , O loveliest , I am Nala — here the messenger of gods ,</l>
     <l n="46">Gods desirous to possess thee ;— one of these , the lord of heaven</l>
     <l n="47">Indra , Agni , Varun , Yama ,— choose thou , princess , for thy lord .</l>
     <l n="48">Through their power , their power almighty — I have entered here unseen ;</l>
     <l n="49">As I entered in thy chamber — none hath seen , and none might stay .</l>
     <l n="50">This , the object of my mission ,— fairest , from the highest gods ,</l>
     <l n="51">Thou hast heard me , noble princess — even as thou wilt , decide . ”</l>

     <l n="1">To the gods performed her homage — smiled she , and to Nala spake :—</l>
     <l n="2">“ Pledge to me thy faith ,<span corresp="#note35" type="note_anchor">[ 35 ]</span>O raja — how that faith , may I requite ?</l>
     <l n="3">I myself , and whatsoever — in the world I have , is thine</l>
     <l n="4">In full trust is thine<span corresp="#note36" type="note_anchor">[ 36 ]</span>— O grant me — in thy turn thy love , O king !</l>
     <l n="5">Tis the swan 's enamouring language — that hath kindled all my soul .</l>
     <l n="6">Only for thy sake , O hero — are the assembled rajas met .</l>

     <l n="8">Poison for thy sake , fire , water ,— the vile noose will I endure . "[ 37 ]</l>
     <l n="9">So , when spake Vidarbha 's maiden — Nala answered thus , and said :—</l>

     <l n="13">Man the gods displeasing , hastens — to inevitable death —</l>
     <l n="14">Fair limbed ! from that fate preserve me — choose the all excelling gods .</l>
     <l n="15">Robes by earthly dust unsullied — crowns of amaranthine flowers ,</l>
     <l n="16">Every bright celestial glory — wedded to the gods , enjoy .</l>
     <l n="17">He , who all the world compressing<span corresp="#note38" type="note_anchor">[ 38 ]</span>— with devouring might consumes ,</l>
     <l n="18">Sovereign of the gods , Hutása ,— where is she who would not wed ?</l>
     <l n="19">He , in awe of whose dread sceptre<span corresp="#note39" type="note_anchor">[ 39 ]</span>— all the assembled hosts of men ,</l>
     <l n="20">Cultivate eternal justice — where is she who would not wed ?</l>

     <l n="24">Varuna , amongst earth 's guardians ,— hear the language of a friend . ”</l>
     <l n="25">To the sovereign of Nishadha — Damayanti spake , and said ,</l>
     <l n="26">And her eyes grew dim with moisture — flowing from her inward grief :—</l>
     <l n="27">“ To the gods , to all , my homage — king of earth , I humbly pay ;</l>
     <l n="28">Yet thee only , thee , my husband — may I choose , Be this my vow ! ”</l>
     <l n="29">Answered he the trembling maiden — as with folded hands she stood ,</l>
     <l n="30">“ Bound upon this solemn mission — mine own cause how dare I urge .</l>
     <l n="31">Plighted by a sacred promise — to the everlasting gods ;</l>
     <l n="32">Thus engaged to plead for others — for myself I may not plead .</l>
     <l n="33">This my duty ; yet hereafter — come I on my own behalf ,</l>
     <l n="34">Then I 'll plead mine own cause boldly — weigh it , beauteous , in thy thought . ”</l>
     <l n="35">Damayanti smiled serenely ,— and with tear-impeded speech ,</l>
     <l n="36">Uttered brokenly and slowly — thus to royal Nala spake :—</l>
     <l n="37">“ Yet I see a way of refuge — ‘ tis a blameless way , O king ;</l>
     <l n="38">Whence no sin to thee , O raja ,— may by any chance arise .</l>
     <l n="39">Thou , O noblest of all mortals — and the gods by Indra led ,</l>
     <l n="40">Come and enter in together — where the Swayembara meets ;</l>
     <l n="41">Then will I , before the presence — of the guardians of the world ,</l>
     <l n="42">Name thee , lord of men ! my husband — nor to thee may blame accrue . ”</l>
     <l n="43">By the maiden of Vidarbha — royal Nala thus addressed ,</l>
     <l n="44">Back again returned , where waited — eager , the expecting gods .</l>
     <l n="45">Him , the guardians of the world , the mighty — ere he yet drew near , beheld ,</l>
     <l n="46">Him they saw , and bade him instant — all his tidings to unfold —</l>
     <l n="47">“ Was she seen of thee , O monarch — Damayanti with soft smile ?</l>
     <l n="48">Spake she of us all ? what said she ?— tell , O blameless lord of earth . ”</l>

     <l n="1">Came the day of happy omen<span corresp="#note42" type="note_anchor">[ 42 ]</span>— moonday meet , and moment apt ;</l>
     <l n="2">Bhima to the Swayembara — summoned all the lords of earth .</l>
     <l n="3">One and all , upon the instant — rose th ’ enamoured lords of earth ,</l>
     <l n="4">Suitors all to Damayanti — in their loving haste they came .</l>
     <l n="5">They , the court with golden columns<span corresp="#note43" type="note_anchor">[ 43 ]</span>— rich , and glittering portal arch ,</l>
     <l n="6">Like the lions on the mountains — entered they the hall of state .</l>
     <l n="7">There the lords of earth were seated — each upon his several throne ;</l>
     <l n="8">All their fragrant garlands wearing — all with pendant ear-gems rich .</l>
     <l n="9">Arms were seen robust and vigorous — as the ponderous battle mace ,</l>
     <l n="10">Some like the five-headed serpents — delicate in shape and hue :[ 44 ]</l>
     <l n="11">With bright locks profuse and flowing — fine formed nose , and eye and brow ,</l>
     <l n="12">Shone the faces of the rajas — like the radiant stars in heaven .</l>
     <l n="13">As with serpents , Bhogavati<span corresp="#note45" type="note_anchor">[ 45 ]</span>— the wide hall was full of kings ;</l>
     <l n="14">As the mountain caves with tigers — with the tiger-warriors full .</l>
     <l n="15">Damayanti in her beauty — entered on that stately scene ,</l>
     <l n="16">With her dazzling light entrancing — every eye and every soul .</l>
     <l n="17">O'er her lovely person gliding — all the eyes of those proud kings ;</l>
     <l n="18">There were fixed , there moveless rested — as they gazed upon the maid .</l>
     <l n="19">Then as they proclaimed the rajas — ( by his name was each proclaimed )</l>
     <l n="20">In dismay saw Bhima 's daughter — five in garb , in form the same .</l>
     <l n="21">On those forms , all undistinguished — each from each , she stood and gazed .</l>
     <l n="22">In her doubt Vidarbha 's princess — Nala 's form might not discern ,<span corresp="#note46" type="note_anchor">[ 46 ]</span></l>
     <l n="23">Whichsoe'er the form she gazed on — him her Nala , him she thought .</l>
     <l n="24">She within her secret spirit — deeply pondering , stood and thought :</l>
     <l n="25">“ How shall I the gods distinguish ?— royal Nala how discern ? ”</l>
     <l n="26">Pondering thus Vidarbha 's maiden — in the anguish of her heart —</l>
     <l n="27">Th ’ attributes of the immortals — sought , as heard of yore , to see .</l>
     <l n="28">“ Th ’ attributes of each celestial — that our aged sires describe ,</l>
     <l n="29">As on earth they stand before me — not of one may I discern . ”</l>
     <l n="30">Long she pondered in her silence — and again , again she thought .</l>
     <l n="31">To the gods , her only refuge — turned she at this trying hour .</l>
     <l n="32">With her voice and with her spirit — she her humble homage paid .</l>
     <l n="33">Folding both her hands and trembling — to the gods the maiden spake :</l>
     <l n="34">“ As when heard the swan 's sweet language — chose I then Nishadha 's king ,</l>
     <l n="35">By this truth I here adjure ye — oh , ye gods , reveal my lord ;</l>
     <l n="36">As in word or thought I swerve not — from my faith , all-knowing powers ,</l>
     <l n="37">By this truth I here adjure ye — oh , ye gods , reveal my lord .</l>
     <l n="38">As the gods themselves have destined — for my lord Nishadha 's king ;</l>
     <l n="39">By this truth I here adjure ye — oh , ye gods , my lord reveal .</l>
     <l n="40">As my vow , so pledged to Nala — holily must be maintained ,</l>
     <l n="41">By this truth I here adjure ye — oh , ye gods , my lord reveal .</l>
     <l n="42">Each the form divine assume ye — earth 's protectors , mighty lords ;</l>
     <l n="43">So shall I discern my Nala — I shall know the king of men . ”</l>
     <l n="44">As they heard sad Damayanti — uttering thus her piteous prayer ,</l>
     <l n="45">At her high resolve they wonder — steadfast truth and fervent love ,</l>
     <l n="46">Holiness of soul , and wisdom — to her lord her constant faith .</l>
     <l n="47">As she prayed , the gods obedient — stood with attributes revealed :</l>
     <l n="48">With unmoistened skins the Immortals — saw she , and with moveless eyes ;<span corresp="#note47" type="note_anchor">[ 47 ]</span></l>
     <l n="49">Fresh their dust-unsullied garlands — hovered they , nor touched the earth .</l>
     <l n="50">On his shadow garland-drooping<span corresp="#note48" type="note_anchor">[ 48 ]</span>— soiled with dust and moist with sweat ,</l>
     <l n="51">On the earth Nishadha 's monarch — stood confessed , with twinkling eyes ;</l>
     <l n="52">On the gods an instant gazed she — then upon the king of men ;</l>
     <l n="53">And of right king Bhima 's daughter — named Nishadha 's king her lord .</l>
     <l n="54">Modestly the large-eyed maiden — lifted up his garment 's hem ,</l>
     <l n="55">Round his shoulders threw she lightly — the bright zone of radiant flowers ;</l>
     <l n="56">So she chose him for her husband — Nala , that high-hearted maid .</l>
     <l n="57">Then alas ! alas ! burst wildly ,— from that conclave of the kings ,</l>
     <l n="58">And “ well done , well done , ” as loudly — from the gods and sages broke ;</l>
     <l n="59">All in their extatic wonder — glorified Nishadha 's king .</l>
     <l n="60">Then to royal Damayanti — Virasena 's kingly son ,</l>
     <l n="61">To that slender waisted damsel — spake he comfort in his joy ;</l>
     <l n="62">“ Since thou'st own 'd me for thine husband — in the presence of the gods ,</l>
     <l n="63">For thy faithful consort know me — aye delighting in thy words .</l>
     <l n="64">While this spirit fills this body — maiden with the smile serene !</l>
     <l n="65">Thine am I , so long thine only — this the solemn truth I vow . ”</l>
     <l n="66">Thus he gladdened Damayanti — with the assurance of his faith ;</l>
     <l n="67">And the happy pair devoutly<span corresp="#note49" type="note_anchor">[ 49 ]</span>— worshipped then the present gods .</l>
     <l n="68">Chosen thus Nishadha 's monarch — the bright guardians of the world ,</l>
     <l n="69">In their gladness all on Nala — eight transcendant gifts bestowed ;</l>
     <l n="70">To discern the visible godhead — in the sacrifice , a gait</l>
     <l n="71">Firm and noble , Sachi 's husband — Indra to king Nala gave .</l>
     <l n="72">Agni gave his own bright presence<span corresp="#note50" type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>— whensoe'er the monarch called .</l>
     <l n="73">All the worlds instinct with splendour — through his power Hutasa gave .</l>
     <l n="74">Subtle taste in food gave Yama — and in virtue eminence ;</l>
     <l n="75">Varun gave obedient water — to be present at his call ;</l>
     <l n="76">Garlands too of matchless fragrance ;— each his double blessing gave .<span corresp="#note51" type="note_anchor">[ 51 ]</span></l>
     <l n="77">Thus bestowed their gracious favours — to the heavens the gods returned ;</l>
     <l n="78">And the rajas , who with wonder — Nala 's marriage saw confirmed</l>
     <l n="79">With the gentle Damayanti — as they came , in joy returned .</l>
     <l n="80">Thus the kings of earth departed ;— Bhima in his joy and pride ,</l>
     <l n="81">Solemnized the stately bridals — of the maiden and the king .</l>
     <l n="82">Fitting time when there he 'd sojourned ,— best of men , Nishadha 's king ;</l>
     <l n="83">Courteous parting with king Bhima — to his native city went .</l>
     <l n="84">Having gained the pearl of women — the majestic lord of earth</l>
     <l n="85">Lived in bliss , as with his Sachi ,<span corresp="#note52" type="note_anchor">[ 52 ]</span>— he that those old giants slew .</l>
     <l n="86">In his joy the elated monarch — shining radiant as the sun ,</l>
     <l n="87">Ruled the subjects of his kingdom — with a just and equal sway .</l>
     <l n="88">Of the horse the famous offering<span corresp="#note53" type="note_anchor">[ 53 ]</span>— like Nahucha 's mighty son ,</l>
     <l n="89">Every sacrifice performed he — with rich gifts to holy men .</l>
     <l n="90">And full oft in flowering gardens — and delicious shady groves ,</l>
     <l n="91">Like a god , the royal Nala — took with Damayanti joy .</l>
     <l n="92">So begat from Damayanti — Nala , of heroic soul ,</l>
     <l n="93">Indrasena one fair daughter — Indrasen one beauteous son .</l>
     <l n="94">Thus in sacrifice and pleasance — took his joy the king of men ,</l>
     <l n="95">So the earth with riches teeming — ruled the sovereign of the earth .</l>

     <l n="3">Watching still the fatal instant — in Nishadha long they dwelt .</l>

     <l n="6">Prayed at eve , with feet unwashen — Kali seized the fatal hour .</l>
     <l n="7">Into Nala straight he entered — and possessed his inmost soul .</l>

     <l n="13">Pushkara the hero-slayer — to king Nala standing near :</l>
     <l n="14">“ Play we with the dice , my brother , ” — thus again , again he said .</l>
     <l n="15">Long the lofty-minded raja — that bold challenge might not brook ,</l>
     <l n="16">In Vidarbha 's princess ’ presence — deemed he now the time for play .</l>
     <l n="17">For his wealth , his golden treasures — for his chariots , for his robes ,</l>

     <l n="35">“ ‘ Tis not he , ” exclaimed in sorrow ,— and in shame and grief went home .</l>

     <l n="2">Undistracted , him distracted — with the maddening love of play .</l>
     <l n="3">In her dread and in her sorrow — thus did Bhima 's daughter speak ;</l>
     <l n="4">Pondering on the weighty business — that concerned the king of men .</l>
     <l n="5">Trembling at his guilty frenzy — yet to please him still intent .</l>
     <l n="6">Nala , ‘ reft of all his treasures — when the noble woman saw ,</l>

     <l n="16">To the palace , Damayanti — to conceal her shame returned .</l>
     <l n="17">When the dice she heard for ever — adverse to the king of men ,</l>
     <l n="18">And of all bereft , her Nala — to the nurse again she spake :</l>

     <l n="27">As by Pushkara is worsted — ever more and more the king ,</l>

     <l n="29">As to Pushkara obedient — ever fall the lucky dice ,</l>
     <l n="30">Thus those dice to royal Nala — still with adverse fortune fall .</l>
     <l n="31">Nor the voice of friend or kindred — as beseems him , will he hear ;</l>

     <l n="1">Scarce Varshneya had departed — still the king of men played on ,</l>
     <l n="2">Till to Pushkara his kingdom — all that he possessed , was lost .</l>
     <l n="3">Nala then , despoiled of kingdom — smiling Pushkara bespake :</l>
     <l n="4">“ Throw we yet another hazard — Nala , where is now thy stake ?</l>
     <l n="5">There remains but Damayanti — all thou hast beside , is mine .</l>
     <l n="6">Throw we now for Damayanti — come , once more the hazard try . ”</l>
     <l n="7">Thus as Pushkara addressed him — Punyasloka 's inmost heart</l>
     <l n="8">By his grief was rent asunder — not a single word he spake .</l>
     <l n="9">And on Pushkara , king Nala — in his silent anguish gazed .</l>
     <l n="10">All his ornaments of splendour — from his person stripped he off ,</l>
     <l n="11">With a single vest , scarce covered ,— ‘ mid the sorrow of his friends .</l>
     <l n="12">Slowly wandered forth the monarch — fallen from such an height of bliss .</l>
     <l n="13">Damayanti with one garment — slowly followed him behind .</l>
     <l n="14">Three long nights Nishadha 's monarch — there without the gates had dwelt .</l>
     <l n="15">Proclamation through the city — then did Pushkara bid make ,</l>
     <l n="16">“ Whosoe'er befriendeth Nala — shall to instant death be doomed . ”</l>
     <l n="17">Thus , as Pushkara gave order — in the terror of his power ,</l>
     <l n="18">Might the citizens no longer — hospitably serve the king .</l>
     <l n="19">Near the walls , of kind reception — worthiest , but by none received ;</l>
     <l n="20">Three nights longer staid the monarch — water was his only drink ,</l>
     <l n="21">He in unfastidious hunger — plucked the fruits , the roots of earth .</l>
     <l n="22">Then went forth again the outcast :— Damayanti followed slow .</l>
     <l n="23">In the agony of famine — Nala , after many days ,</l>
     <l n="24">Saw some birds around him settling — with their golden tinctured wings .</l>
     <l n="25">Then the monarch of Nishadha — thought within his secret heart ,</l>
     <l n="26">These to-day my welcome banquet — and my treasure these will be .</l>
     <l n="27">Over them his single garment — spreading light he wrapped them round :</l>
     <l n="28">Up that single garment bearing — to the air they sprang away ;</l>
     <l n="29">And the birds above him hovering — thus in human accents spake ,</l>
     <l n="30">Naked as they saw him standing — on the earth , and sad , and lone :—</l>
     <l n="31">“ Lo , we are the dice , to spoil thee — thus descended , foolish king !</l>
     <l n="32">While thou hadst a single garment — all our joy was incomplete . ”</l>
     <l n="33">When the dice he saw departing — and himself without his robe ,</l>
     <l n="34">Mournfully did Punyasloka — thus to Damayanti speak :</l>
     <l n="35">“ They , O blameless , by whose anger — from my kingdom I am driven ,</l>
     <l n="36">Life-sustaining food unable — in my misery to find —</l>
     <l n="37">They , through whom Nishadha 's people — may not house their outcast king —</l>
     <l n="38">They , the forms of birds assuming — my one robe have borne away .</l>
     <l n="39">In the dark extreme of misery — sad and frantic as I am ,</l>
     <l n="40">Hear me , princess , hear and profit — by thy husband 's best advice .</l>
     <l n="41">Hence are many roads diverging — to the region of the south ,<span corresp="#note63" type="note_anchor">[ 63 ]</span></l>
     <l n="42">Passing by Avanti 's city<span corresp="#note64" type="note_anchor">[ 64 ]</span>— and the height of Rishavàn ;</l>
     <l n="43">Vindhya here , the mighty mountain<span corresp="#note65" type="note_anchor">[ 65 ]</span>— and Payoshni 's seaward stream ;<span corresp="#note66" type="note_anchor">[ 66 ]</span></l>
     <l n="44">And the lone retreats of hermits — on the fruits of earth that live ;</l>
     <l n="45">This will lead thee to Vidarbha — this to Cosala away ,<span corresp="#note67" type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span></l>
     <l n="46">Far beyond the region stretches — southward to the southward clime . ”</l>
     <l n="47">In these words to Damayanti — did the royal Nala speak ,</l>
     <l n="48">More than once to Bhima 's daughter — anxious pointing out the way .</l>
     <l n="49">She , with voice half choked with sorrow — with her weight of woe oppressed ,</l>
     <l n="50">These sad words did Damayanti — to Nishadha 's monarch speak :—</l>
     <l n="51">“ My afflicted heart is breaking — and my sinking members fail ,</l>
     <l n="52">When , O king , thy desperate counsel — once I think of , once again .</l>
     <l n="53">Robbed of kingdom , robbed of riches — naked , thirst and hunger worn ;</l>
     <l n="54">How shall I depart and leave thee — in the wood by man untrod .</l>
     <l n="55">When thou sad and famine-stricken — thinkest of thy former bliss ,</l>
     <l n="56">In the wild wood , oh , my husband ,— I thy weariness will soothe .</l>
     <l n="57">Like a wife , in every sorrow — this the wise physicians own ,</l>

     <l n="6">Nala thus to Damayanti — spake again , and yet again ,</l>
     <l n="7">Comforting the noble lady — scant in half a garment clad .</l>
     <l n="8">Both together by one garment<span corresp="#note68" type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>— covered , roamed they here and there ;</l>
     <l n="9">Wearied out by thirst and famine — to a cabin drew they near .</l>
     <l n="10">When they reached that lowly cabin — then did great Nishadha 's king</l>
     <l n="11">With the princess of Vidarbha — on the hard earth seat them down ;</l>
     <l n="12">Naked , with no mat to rest on — wet with mire and stained with dust .</l>
     <l n="13">Weary then with Damayanti — on the earth he fell asleep .</l>
     <l n="14">Sank the lovely Damayanti — by his side with sleep opprest ,</l>
     <l n="15">She thus plunged in sudden misery — she the tender , the devout .</l>
     <l n="16">But while on the cold earth slumbered — Damayanti , all distraught</l>
     <l n="17">Nala in his mind by sorrow — might no longer calmly sleep ;</l>
     <l n="18">For the losing of his kingdom — the desertion of his friends ,</l>
     <l n="19">And his weary forest wanderings — painful on his thought arose ;</l>
     <l n="20">“ If I do it , what may follow ?— what if I refuse to do ?</l>
     <l n="21">Were my instant death the better — or to abandon her I love .</l>
     <l n="22">But to me too deep devoted — suffers she distress and shame ;</l>
     <l n="23">Reft of me she home may wander — to her royal father 's house ;</l>
     <l n="24">Faithful wandering ever with me — certain sorrow will she bear ,</l>
     <l n="25">But if separated from me — chance of solace may be hers . ”</l>
     <l n="26">Long within his heart he pondered — and again , again weighed o'er .</l>
     <l n="27">Best he thought it Damayanti — to desert , that wretched king .</l>
     <l n="28">From her virtue none dare harm her<span corresp="#note69" type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span>— in the lonely forest way ,</l>
     <l n="29">Her the fortunate , the noble — my devoted wedded wife .</l>
     <l n="30">Thus his mind on Damayanti — dwelt in its perverted thought ,</l>
     <l n="31">Wrought by Kali 's evil influence — to desert his lovely wife .</l>
     <l n="32">Of himself without a garment — and of her with only one .</l>
     <l n="33">As he thought , approached he near her — to divide that single robe .</l>
     <l n="34">“ How shall I divide the garment — by my loved one unperceived ? ”</l>
     <l n="35">Pondering this within his spirit — round the cabin Nala went ;</l>
     <l n="36">In that narrow cabin 's circuit — Nala wandered here and there ,</l>
     <l n="37">Till he found without a scabbard — shining , a well-tempered sword .</l>
     <l n="38">Then when half that only garment — he had severed , and put on ,</l>
     <l n="39">In her sleep Vidarbha 's princess — with bewildered mind he fled .</l>
     <l n="40">Yet , his cruel heart relenting — to the cabin turns he back ;</l>
     <l n="41">On the slumbering Damayanti — gazing , sadly wept the king ;</l>
     <l n="42">“ Thou , that sun nor wind hath ever — roughly visited , my love !</l>
     <l n="43">On the hard earth in a cabin — sleepest with thy guardian gone .</l>
     <l n="44">Thus attired in half a garment — she that aye so sweetly smiled ,</l>
     <l n="45">Like to one distracted , beauteous — how at length will she awake ?</l>
     <l n="46">How will't fare with Bhima 's daughter — lone , abandoned by her lord ,</l>
     <l n="47">Wandering in the savage forest — where wild beasts and serpents dwell .</l>
     <l n="48">May the suns and winds of heaven — may the genii of the woods ,<span corresp="#note70" type="note_anchor">[ 70 ]</span></l>
     <l n="49">Noblest , may they all protect thee — thine own virtue thy best guard . ”</l>
     <l n="50">To his wife of peerless beauty — on the earth , ‘ twas thus he spoke .</l>
     <l n="51">Then of sense bereft by Kali — Nala hastily set forth ;</l>
     <l n="52">And departing , still departing — he returned again , again ;</l>
     <l n="53">Dragged away by that bad demon — ever by his love drawn back .</l>
     <l n="54">Nala , thus his heart divided — into two conflicting parts ,</l>
     <l n="55">Like a swing goes backward , forward — from the cabin , to and fro .</l>
     <l n="56">Torn away at length by Kali — flies afar the frantic king ,</l>
     <l n="57">Leaving there his wife in slumber — making miserable moans .</l>
     <l n="58">Reft of sense , possessed by Kali — thinking still on her he left ,</l>
     <l n="59">Passed he in the lonely forest — leaving his deserted wife .</l>

     <l n="10">Her in sooth that never wronged thee — wronged indeed , but not by her .</l>
     <l n="11">Keep'st thou thus thy solemn promise — oh , unfaithful lord of men ,</l>
     <l n="12">There , when all the gods were present — plighted to thy wedded wife ?</l>
     <l n="13">Death is but decreed to mortals — at its own appointed time ,</l>
     <l n="14">Hence one moment , thus deserted<span corresp="#note71" type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>— one brief moment do I live .—</l>
     <l n="15">But thou'st had thy sport — enough then — now desist , O king of men ,</l>
     <l n="16">Mock not thou a trembling woman — show thee to me , O my lord !</l>
     <l n="17">Yes , I see thee , there I see thee — hidden as thou think'st from sight ,</l>
     <l n="18">In the rushes why conceal thee ?— answer me , why speak'st thou not .</l>
     <l n="19">Wherefore now ungentle stay'st thou — like to one forsworn , aloof ?</l>
     <l n="20">Wherefore wilt thou not approach me — to console me in my woe ?</l>
     <l n="21">For myself I will not sorrow — nor for aught to me befalls .</l>
     <l n="22">Thou art all alone , my husband ,— I will only mourn for thee .</l>
     <l n="23">How will't fare with thee , my Nala — thirsting , famished , faint with toil .</l>
     <l n="24">Nor beholding me await thee — underneath the trees at eve . ”</l>
     <l n="25">Then , in all her depth of anguish — with her trouble as on fire ,</l>
     <l n="26">Hither , thither , went she weeping — all around she went and wailed .</l>
     <l n="27">Now springs up the desolate princess — now falls down in prostrate grief ;</l>
     <l n="28">Now she pines in silent sorrow — now she shrieks and wails aloud .</l>
     <l n="29">So consumed with inward misery — ever sighing more and more ,</l>
     <l n="30">Spake at length king Bhima 's daughter — spake the still devoted wife :</l>
     <l n="31">“ He , by whose dire imprecation — Nala this dread suffering bears ,</l>
     <l n="32">May he far surpass in suffering — all that Nala suffers now ,</l>
     <l n="33">May the evil one , to evil — who the blameless Nala drives ,</l>
     <l n="34">Smitten by a curse as fatal — live a dark unblessed life . ”</l>
     <l n="35">Thus her absent lord lamenting — that high-minded raja 's queen ,</l>
     <l n="36">Every-where her lord went seeking — in the satyr-haunted wood .<span corresp="#note72" type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span></l>
     <l n="37">Like a maniac , Bhima 's daughter — wandered wailing here and there ;</l>
     <l n="38">And “ alas ! alas ! my husband ” — every-where her cry was heard .</l>
     <l n="39">Her beyond all measure wailing — like the osprey screaming shrill ,</l>
     <l n="40">Miserably still deploring — still renewing her lament .</l>
     <l n="41">Suddenly king Bhima 's daughter — as she wandered near his lair ,</l>
     <l n="42">Seized a huge gigantic serpent — in his raging famine fierce .</l>
     <l n="43">In the grasp of that fierce serpent — round about with terror girt ,</l>
     <l n="44">Not herself she pities only — pities she Nishadha 's king .</l>
     <l n="45">“ O my guardian , thus unguarded — in this savage forest seized ,</l>
     <l n="46">Seized by this terrific serpent — wherefore art not thou at hand ?</l>
     <l n="47">How will't be , when thou rememberest — once again thy faithful wife ,</l>
     <l n="48">From this dreadful curse delivered — mind , and sense , and wealth returned ?</l>
     <l n="49">When thou'rt weary , when thou'rt hungry — when thou'rt fainting with fatigue ,</l>
     <l n="50">Who will soothe , O blameless Nala — all thy weariness , thy woe . ”</l>
     <l n="51">Then a huntsman as he wandered — in the forest jungle thick ,</l>
     <l n="52">As he heard her thus bewailing — in his utmost haste drew near .</l>
     <l n="53">In the grasp when he beheld her — of that long-eyed serpent fell ,</l>
     <l n="54">Instant did the nimble huntsman — rapidly as he came on ,</l>
     <l n="55">Pierce that unresisting serpent — with a sharp and mortal shaft :</l>
     <l n="56">In her sight he slew that serpent — skill 'd in slaughter of the chase .</l>
     <l n="57">Her released he from her peril — washed he then with water pure ,</l>
     <l n="58">And with sylvan food refreshed her — and with soothing words address 'd :</l>
     <l n="59">“ Who art thou that roam'st the forest — with the eyes of the gazelle ;</l>
     <l n="60">How to this extreme of misery — noble lady , hast thou fallen ? ”</l>
     <l n="61">Damayanti , by the huntsman — thus in soothing tone addressed ,</l>
     <l n="62">All the story of her misery-told him , as it all befell ;</l>
     <l n="63">Her , scant-clothed in half a garment — with soft swelling limbs and breast ,</l>
     <l n="64">Form of youthful faultless beauty — and her fair and moonlike face ,</l>
     <l n="65">And her eyes with brows dark arching — and her softly-melting speech ,</l>
     <l n="66">Saw long time that wild beast hunter — kindled all his heart with love .</l>
     <l n="67">Then with winning voice that huntsman — bland beginning his discourse ,</l>
     <l n="68">Fain with amorous speech would soothe her — she his dark intent perceived .</l>
     <l n="69">Damayanti , chaste and faithful ,— soon as she his meaning knew ,</l>
     <l n="70">In the transport of her anger — her indignant soul took fire .</l>
     <l n="71">In his wicked thought the dastard — her yet powerless to subdue ,</l>
     <l n="72">On the unsubdued stood gazing — as like some bright flame she shone .</l>
     <l n="73">Damayanti , in her sorrow — of her realm , her lord bereft ,</l>
     <l n="74">On the instant she found language — uttered loud her curse of wrath ,<span corresp="#note73" type="note_anchor">[ 73 ]</span>—</l>
     <l n="75">“ As my pure and constant spirit — swerves not from Nishadha 's lord ,</l>
     <l n="76">Instant so may this base hunter — lifeless fall upon the earth . ”</l>
     <l n="77">Scarce that single word was uttered — suddenly that hunter bold</l>
     <l n="78">Down upon the earth fell lifeless — like a lightning blasted tree .</l>

     <l n="1">Slain that savage wild-beast hunter — onward went the lotus-eyed ,</l>

     <l n="3">Full of lions , pards , and tigers — stags , and buffalos , and bears ,</l>
     <l n="4">Where all kinds of birds were flocking — and wild men and robbers dwelt .</l>

     <l n="9">She , in forms terrific round her — serpents , elves , and giants saw :[ 75 ]</l>
     <l n="10">Pools , and tanks of lucid water — and the shaggy tops of hills ,</l>
     <l n="11">Flowing streams and headlong torrents — saw , and wondered at the sight .</l>

     <l n="37">Make this oft-repeated language — make this oft-sworn promise true .</l>
     <l n="38">To thy queen bereft of reason — to thy weeping wife beloved ,</l>
     <l n="39">Why repliest thou not — her only thou desir'st — she only thee .</l>
     <l n="40">Meagre , miserable , pallid — tainted with the dust and mire ,</l>
     <l n="41">Scantly clad in half a garment — lone , with no protector near ;</l>

     <l n="53">Who this day will show the monarch — wandering in the forest depth ,</l>
     <l n="54">Beautiful and royal-minded — conqueror of an host of foes !</l>
     <l n="55">‘ Him thou seek'st with eyes of lotus — Nala , sovereign of men —</l>
     <l n="56">Lo , he 's here ! ’ whose voice of music — may I hear thus sweetly speak ?</l>
     <l n="57">Lo , with fourfold tusks before me — and with wide and gaping jaws ,</l>
     <l n="58">Stands the forest king , the tiger — I approach him without fear .</l>
     <l n="59">Of the beasts art thou the monarch — all this forest thy domain ,</l>

     <l n="177">To the lady thus complaining — lonely in the savage wood ,</l>
     <l n="178">Answered thus those holy hermits — spake the gifted seers the truth :—</l>
     <l n="179">“ There will be a time hereafter — beautiful , the time will come ,</l>
     <l n="180">Through devotion now we see him<span corresp="#note88" type="note_anchor">[ 88 ]</span>— and thou too wilt see him soon ;</l>
     <l n="181">That good monarch of Nishadha — Nala , slayer of his foes ;</l>
     <l n="182">That dispenser of strict justice — Bhima 's daughter ! free from grief ,</l>
     <l n="183">From all sin released , thou'lt see him — glittering in his royal gems ,</l>
     <l n="184">Governing that noble city — o'er his enemies supreme .</l>
     <l n="185">To his foemen causing terror — to his friends allaying grief ,</l>
     <l n="186">Thou , oh noble , shalt thy husband — see , that king of noble race . ”</l>
     <l n="187">To the much-loved wife of Nala — to the princess speaking thus ,</l>
     <l n="188">Vanished then those holy hermits — with their sacred fires , their cells .</l>
     <l n="189">As she gazed upon the wonder — wrapt in mute amaze she stood ;</l>
     <l n="190">Damayanti , fair-limbed princess — wife of Virasena 's son ;</l>
     <l n="191">“ Have I only seen a vision — what hath been this wondrous chance ?</l>
     <l n="192">Where are all those holy hermits — where the circle of their cells ?</l>
     <l n="193">Where that pure and pleasant river — haunted by the dipping birds ?</l>
     <l n="194">Where those trees with grateful umbrage — with their pendant fruits and</l>
     <l n="195">flowers ? ”</l>
     <l n="196">Long within her heart she pondered — Damayanti with sweet smile ,</l>
     <l n="197">For her lord , to grief abandoned — miserable , pale of hue ;</l>
     <l n="198">To another region passed she — there with voice by weeping choked ,</l>
     <l n="199">Mourns she , till with eyes o'erflowing — an Asoca tree she saw .</l>
     <l n="200">Best of trees , the Asoca blooming<span corresp="#note89" type="note_anchor">[ 89 ]</span>— in the forest she approached ,</l>
     <l n="201">Gemmed all o'er with glowing fruitage — vocal with the songs of birds .</l>
     <l n="202">“ Ah , behold amid the forest — flourishes this happy tree ,</l>
     <l n="203">With its leafy garlands radiant — as the joyous mountain king .</l>
     <l n="204">O thou tree with pleasant aspect — from my sorrow set me free .</l>
     <l n="205">Vitasoca , hast thou seen him — hast the fearless raja seen ,</l>
     <l n="206">Nala , of his foes the slayer — Damayanti 's lord beloved ?</l>
     <l n="207">Hast thou seen Nishadha 's monarch — hast thou seen mine only love ,</l>
     <l n="208">Clad in half a single garment — with his soft and delicate skin ;</l>
     <l n="209">Hast thou seen th ’ afflicted hero — wandering in the forest lone .</l>
     <l n="210">That I may depart ungrieving — fair Asoca , answer me .</l>
     <l n="211">Truly be thou named Asoca<span corresp="#note90" type="note_anchor">[ 90 ]</span>— as the extinguisher of grief . ”</l>
     <l n="212">Thus in her o'erpowering anguish — moved she round the Asoca tree .</l>
     <l n="213">Then she went her way in sadness — to another region dread .</l>
     <l n="214">Many a tree she stood and gazed on — many a river passed she o'er ;</l>
     <l n="215">Passed she many a pleasant mountain — many a wild deer , many a bird ;</l>
     <l n="216">Many a hill and many a cavern — many a bright and wondrous stream ,</l>
     <l n="217">Saw king Bhima 's wandering daughter — as she sought her husband lost .</l>
     <l n="218">Long she roamed her weary journey — Damayanti with sweet smile ,</l>
     <l n="219">Lo , a caravan of merchants — elephants , and steeds , and cars ,</l>
     <l n="220">And beyond , a pleasant river — with its waters cool and clear .</l>
     <l n="221">‘ Twas a quiet stream , and waveless — girt about with spreading canes ;</l>
     <l n="222">There the cuckoo , there the osprey — there the red-geese clamouring stood ;</l>
     <l n="223">Swarmed the turtles , fish and serpents — there rose many a stately isle .</l>
     <l n="224">When she saw that numerous concourse — Nala 's once all-glorious wife ,</l>
     <l n="225">Entered she , the slender-waisted — in the midst of all the host ;</l>
     <l n="226">Maniac-like in form and feature — and in half a garment clad ,</l>
     <l n="227">Thin and pallid , travel-tainted — matted all her locks with dust .</l>
     <l n="228">As they all beheld her standing — some in terror fled away ;</l>
     <l n="229">Some stood still in speechless wonder — others raised their voice and cried ;</l>
     <l n="230">Mocked her some with cruel tauntings — others spake reproachful words ;</l>
     <l n="231">Others looked on her with pity — and enquired her state , her name .</l>
     <l n="232">“ Who art thou ? whose daughter . Lady — in the forest seek'st thou aught ?</l>
     <l n="233">At thy sight we stand confounded — art thou of our mortal race ?</l>
     <l n="234">Of this wood art thou the goddess ?— of this mountain ? of that plain ?</l>
     <l n="235">Who art thou , O noble Lady — thee , our refuge , we adore .</l>
     <l n="236">Art thou sylvan nymph or genius — or celestial nymph divine ?</l>
     <l n="237">Every-way regard our welfare — and protect us , undespised :</l>
     <l n="238">So our caravan in safety — may pursue its onward way ,</l>
     <l n="239">So ordain it , O illustrious !— that good fortune wait on all . ”</l>
     <l n="240">Thus addressed by that assemblage — Damayanti , kingly-born ,</l>
     <l n="241">Answered thus with gentle language — grieving for her husband lost .</l>
     <l n="242">Of that caravan the leader — and the whole assembled host ,</l>
     <l n="243">Youths and boys , and grey-haired elders — and the guides , thus answered she :</l>
     <l n="244">“ Know me , like yourselves , a mortal — daughter of a king of men ,</l>
     <l n="245">Of another king the consort — seeking for my royal lord ;</l>
     <l n="246">Know , Vidarbha 's king , my father — and Nishadha 's king , my lord ,</l>
     <l n="247">Nala , is his name , the glorious — him , th ’ unconquered do I seek ;</l>
     <l n="248">Know ye aught of that good monarch — tell me , quick , of my beloved ,</l>
     <l n="249">Of the tiger hero , Nala — slayer of a host of foes . ”</l>
     <l n="250">Of the caravan the captain — thus the lovely-limbed addressed ,</l>
     <l n="251">Suchi was his name , the merchant — “ Hear , illustrious queen , my speech ;</l>
     <l n="252">Of this caravan the captain — I , O Lady with sweet smile ,</l>
     <l n="253">Him that bears the name of Nala — nowhere have these eyes beheld .</l>
     <l n="254">Elephants , and pards , and tigers — lynxes , buffaloes , and bears ,</l>
     <l n="255">See I in this trackless forest — uninhabited by men ;</l>
     <l n="256">Save thyself , of human feature — nought , or human form , I 've seen .</l>
     <l n="257">So may he , the king of Yakshas — Manibhadra , guard us well . "[ 91 ]</l>
     <l n="258">To the merchants then she answered — to the leader of the host ,</l>
     <l n="259">“ Tell me whither do ye travel !— whither bound your caravan ? ”</l>

     <l n="1"><span corresp="#note93" type="note_anchor">[ 93 ]</span>This , the lovely princess hearing — from the captain of the band ,</l>
     <l n="2">With the caravan set forward — seeking still her royal lord .</l>
     <l n="3">Long their journey through the forest — through the dark and awful glens ;</l>
     <l n="4">Then a lake of loveliest beauty — fragrant with the lotus flowers ,</l>
     <l n="5">Saw those merchants , wide and pleasant — with fresh grass and shady trees ;</l>
     <l n="6">Flowers and fruits bedecked its borders — where the birds melodious sang :</l>
     <l n="7">In its clear delicious waters — soul-enchanting , icy cool ,</l>
     <l n="8">With their horses all o'erwearied — thought they then to plunge and bathe ;</l>
     <l n="9">At the signal of the captain — entered all that pleasant grove .</l>
     <l n="10">At the close of day arriving — there encamped they for the night .</l>
     <l n="11">When the midnight came , all noiseless — came in silence deep and still ,</l>
     <l n="12">Weary slept the band of merchants — lo , a herd of elephants ,<span corresp="#note94" type="note_anchor">[ 94 ]</span></l>
     <l n="13">Oozing moisture from their temples — came to drink the troubled stream .</l>
     <l n="14">When that caravan they gazed on — with their slumbering beasts at rest ,</l>
     <l n="15">The tame elephants they scented — those wild forest elephants ;</l>
     <l n="16">Forward rush they fleet and furious — mad to slay , and wild with heat ;</l>
     <l n="17">Irresistible the onset — of the rushing ponderous beasts ,</l>
     <l n="18">As the peaks from some high mountain — down the valley thundering roll ;</l>
     <l n="19">Strewn was all the way before them — with the boughs , the trunks of trees ;</l>
     <l n="20">On they crash 'd to where the travellers — slumbered by the lotus lake .</l>
     <l n="21">Trampled down without a struggle — helpless on the earth they lay ,</l>
     <l n="22">“ Woe , oh , woe ! ” shrieked out the merchants — wildly some began to fly ,</l>
     <l n="23">In the forest thickets ’ plunging ;— some stood gasping , blind with sleep ;</l>
     <l n="24">And the elephants down beat them — with their tusks , their trunks , their</l>
     <l n="25">feet .</l>
     <l n="26">Many saw their camels dying — mingled with the men on foot ,</l>
     <l n="27">And in frantic tumult rushing — wildly struck each other down ;</l>
     <l n="28">Many miserably shrieking — cast them down upon the earth ,</l>
     <l n="29">Many climbed the trees in terror — on the rough ground stumbled some .</l>
     <l n="30">Thus in various wise and fatal — by the elephants assailed ,</l>
     <l n="31">Lay that caravan so wealthy — scattered all abroad or slain .</l>
     <l n="32">Such , so fearful was the tumult — the three worlds seemed all appalled ,<span corresp="#note95" type="note_anchor">[ 95 ]</span></l>
     <l n="33">“ ‘ Tis a fire amid th ’ encampment — save ye , fly ye , for your lives .</l>
     <l n="34">Lo , your precious pearls ye trample — take them up , why fly so fast ?</l>
     <l n="35">Save them , ‘ tis a common venture — fear ye not that I deceive . ”</l>
     <l n="36">Thus t ’ each other shrieked the merchants — as in fear they scattered round .</l>
     <l n="37">“ Yet again I call upon you — cowards ! think ye what ye do . ”</l>
     <l n="38">All around this frantic carnage — raging through the prostrate host ,</l>
     <l n="39">Damayanti , soon awakened — with her heart all full of dread ;</l>
     <l n="40">There she saw a hideous slaughter — the whole world might well appal .</l>
     <l n="41">To such sights all unfamiliar — gazed the queen with lotus eyes ,</l>
     <l n="42">Pressing in her breath with terror — slowly rose she on her feet .</l>
     <l n="43">And the few that scaped the carnage — few that scaped without a wound ,</l>
     <l n="44">All at once exclaimed together — “ Of whose deeds is this the doom ?</l>
     <l n="45">Hath not mighty Manibhadra — adoration meet received .</l>

     <l n="48">Was it doomed , that all good omens — by this chance should be belied !</l>
     <l n="49">Were no planets haply adverse ?— how hath fate , like this , befall'n ! ”</l>
     <l n="50">Others answered in their misery — reft of kindred and of wealth ,</l>
     <l n="51">“ Who is that ill-omened woman — that with maniac-staring eyes ,</l>
     <l n="52">Joined our host , misshaped in aspect — and with scarcely human form ?</l>
     <l n="53">Surely all this wicked witchcraft — by her evil power is wrought ;</l>
     <l n="54">Witch or sorceress she , or dæmon — fatal cause of all our fears ,</l>
     <l n="55">Hers is all the guilt , the misery — who such damning proof may doubt ?</l>
     <l n="56">Could we but behold that false one — murtheress , bane of all our host ,</l>
     <l n="57">With the clods , the dust , the bamboos — with our staves , or with our hands ,</l>
     <l n="58">We would slay her on the instant — of our caravan the fate . ”</l>
     <l n="59">But no sooner Damayanti — their appalling words had heard ,</l>
     <l n="60">In her shame and in her terror — to the forest shade she fled .</l>
     <l n="61">And that guilt imputed dreading — thus her fate began to wail :</l>
     <l n="62">“ Woe is me , still o'er me hovers — the terrific wrath of fate ;</l>
     <l n="63">No good fortune e'er attends me — of what guilt is this the doom ?</l>
     <l n="64">Not a sin can I remember — not the least to living man .</l>
     <l n="65">Or in deed , or thought , or language — of what guilt is this the doom ?</l>
     <l n="66">In some former life committed<span corresp="#note97" type="note_anchor">[ 97 ]</span>— expiate I now the sin .</l>
     <l n="67">To this infinite misfortune — hence by penal justice doomed ?</l>
     <l n="68">Lost my husband , lost my kingdom — from my kindred separate ;</l>
     <l n="69">Separate from noble Nala — from my children far away ,</l>
     <l n="70">Widowed of my rightful guardian — in the serpent-haunted wood . ”</l>
     <l n="71">Of that caravan at morning — then the sad surviving few ,</l>
     <l n="72">Setting forth from that dread region — o'er that hideous carnage grieve ;</l>
     <l n="73">Each a brother mourns , or father — or a son , or dearest friend ,</l>
     <l n="74">Still Vidarbha 's princess uttered — “ What the sin that I have done ?</l>
     <l n="75">Scarcely in this desert forest — had I met this host of men ,</l>
     <l n="76">By the elephants they perish — this is through my luckless fate ;</l>
     <l n="77">A still lengthening life of sorrow — I henceforth must sadly lead .</l>
     <l n="78">Ere his destined day none dieth — this of aged seers the lore ;</l>
     <l n="79">Therefore am not I too trampled — by this herd of furious beasts .</l>
     <l n="80">Every deed of living mortal — by over-ruling fate is done .</l>
     <l n="81">Yet no sin have I committed — in my blameless infancy ,</l>
     <l n="82">To deserve this dire disaster — or in word , or deed , or thought .</l>
     <l n="83">For the choosing of my husband — are the guardians of the world ,</l>
     <l n="84">Angry are the gods , rejected — for the noble Nala 's sake ?</l>
     <l n="85">From my lord this long divorcement — through their power do I endure . ”</l>
     <l n="86">Thus the noblest of all women — to bewail her fate began ,</l>
     <l n="87">The deserted Damayanti — with these sad and bitter words ;</l>
     <l n="88">With some Veda-reading Brahmins — that survived that scattered host ,</l>
     <l n="89">Then she went her way in sadness — like the young moon 's sickle pale ,</l>
     <l n="90">And ere long a mighty city — that afflicted queen drew near :</l>
     <l n="91">‘ Twas the king of Chedi 's city — truth-discerning Subahu .</l>
     <l n="92">Scantly clad in half a garment — entered she that stately town ;</l>
     <l n="93">Her disturbed , emaciate , wretched — with dishevelled hair , unwashed ,</l>
     <l n="94">Like a maniac , onward-moving — saw that city 's wondering throng ;</l>
     <l n="95">Gazing on her as she entered — to the monarch 's royal seat ;</l>
     <l n="96">All the boys her footsteps followed — in their curious gamesome play ;<span corresp="#note98" type="note_anchor">[ 98 ]</span></l>
     <l n="97">Circled round by these she wandered — near the royal palace gate .</l>
     <l n="98">From that palace lofty terrace — her the mother of the king</l>
     <l n="99">Saw , and thus her nurse addressed she — “ Go , and lead that wanderer in !</l>
     <l n="100">Sad she roves , without a refuge — troubled by those gazing men ;</l>
     <l n="101">Yet in form so bright , irradiate — is our palace where she moves .</l>
     <l n="102">Though so maniac-like , half-clothed — like Heaven 's long-eyed queen she</l>
     <l n="103">seems . ”</l>
     <l n="104">She those crowding men dispersing — quickly to the palace top</l>
     <l n="105">Made her mount — and in amazement — her the mother-queen addressed :</l>
     <l n="106">“ Thus though bowed and worn with sorrow — such a shining form thou wear'st ,</l>
     <l n="107">As through murky clouds the lightning — tell me who thou art and whence :</l>
     <l n="108">For thy form is more than human — of all ornament despoiled :</l>
     <l n="109">Men thou fear'st not , unattended — in celestial beauty safe . ”</l>
     <l n="110">Hearing thus her gentle language — Bhima 's daughter made reply ,</l>
     <l n="111">“ Know me like thyself a mortal — a distressed , devoted wife ;</l>
     <l n="112">Of illustrious race an handmaid — making where I will mine home ;</l>
     <l n="113">On the roots and wild-fruits feeding — lonely , at the fall of eve .</l>
     <l n="114">Gifted with unnumber 'd virtues — is my true , my faithful lord ,</l>
     <l n="115">And I still the hero followed — like his shadow on the way .</l>
     <l n="116">‘ Twas his fate , with desp'rate fondness — to pursue the love of play ,</l>
     <l n="117">And in play subdued and ruined — entered he yon lonely wood ;</l>
     <l n="118">Him , arrayed in but one garment ,— like a madman wandering wild ,</l>
     <l n="119">To console my noble husband — I too entered the deep wood ;</l>
     <l n="120">He within that dreary forest — for some cause , to me unknown ,</l>
     <l n="121">Wild with hunger , reft of reason — that one single robe he lost .</l>
     <l n="122">I with but one robe , him naked<span corresp="#note99" type="note_anchor">[ 99 ]</span>— frantic , and with mind diseased ,</l>
     <l n="123">Following through the boundless forest — many a night I had not slept ;</l>
     <l n="124">Then , when I had sunk to slumber — me the blameless leaving there ,</l>
     <l n="125">Half my garment having severed — he his sinless consort fled ;</l>
     <l n="126">Seeking him , my outcast husband — night and day am I consumed :</l>
     <l n="127">Him I see not , ever shining — like the lotus cup , beloved ;</l>
     <l n="128">Find him not , most like th ’ immortals — lord of all , my life , my soul . ”</l>
     <l n="129">Even as thus , with eyes o'erflowing — uttered she her sad lament ,</l>
     <l n="130">Sad herself , sad Bhima 's daughter — did the mother queen address :</l>
     <l n="131">“ Dwell with me , then , noble Lady — deep the joy in thee I feel ,</l>
     <l n="132">And the servants of my household — shall thy royal husband seek ;</l>
     <l n="133">Haply hither he may wander — as he roams about the world :</l>
     <l n="134">Dwelling here in peace and honour — thou thy husband wilt rejoin . ”</l>
     <l n="135">To the king of Chedi 's mother — Damayanti made reply ;</l>
     <l n="136">“ On these terms , O nurse of heroes !— I with thee may make abode :</l>
     <l n="137">That I eat not broken victuals<span corresp="#note100" type="note_anchor">[ 100 ]</span>— wash not feet with menial hand :[ 101 ]</l>
     <l n="138">Nor with stranger men have converse — in my chaste , secluded state ;</l>
     <l n="139">If that any man demand me — be he punished ; if again ,</l>
     <l n="140">Be he put to death on th ’ instant — this the vow that I have sworn .</l>
     <l n="141">Only , if they seek my husband — holy Brahmins will I see .</l>
     <l n="142">Be my terms by thee accepted — gladly will I sojourn here ,</l>
     <l n="143">But on other terms no sojourn — will this heart resolved admit . ”</l>
     <l n="144">Then to her with joyful spirit — spake the mother of the king :</l>
     <l n="145">“ As thou wilt shall all be ordered — be thou blest , since such thy vow . ”</l>
     <l n="146">Speaking thus to Bhima 's daughter — did the royal mother then ,</l>
     <l n="147">In these words address her daughter — young Sunanda was her name :</l>
     <l n="148">“ See this handmaid , my Sunanda — gifted with a form divine ;</l>
     <l n="149">She in age thy lovely compeer — be she to thee as a friend ;</l>
     <l n="150">Joined with her in sweet communion — take thy pleasure without fear . ”</l>
     <l n="151">Young Sunanda , all rejoicing — to her own abode went back ,</l>
     <l n="152">Taking with her Damayanti — circled with her virgin peers .</l>

     <l n="8">“ Me , Karkotaka , the Serpent — know , thou sovereign of men ;</l>
     <l n="9">Narada , the famous hermit<span corresp="#note102" type="note_anchor">[ 102 ]</span>— I deceived , the holy sage ;</l>
     <l n="10">He in righteous indignation — smote me with this awful curse :</l>
     <l n="11">Stay thou there as one unmoving — till king Nala passing by ,</l>
     <l n="12">Lead thee hence ; save only Nala — none can free thee from this curse .</l>
     <l n="13">Through this potent execration — I no step have power to move ;</l>
     <l n="14">I the way to bliss will show thee — if thou sav'st me from this fate .</l>
     <l n="15">I will show thee noble friendship — serpent none is like to me ;</l>
     <l n="16">Lightly shall I weigh , uplift me — in thy hand , with speed , O king . ”</l>
     <l n="17">Thus when spake the king of serpents — to a finger 's size he shrank ;</l>
     <l n="18">Him when Nala lightly lifted — to the unburning space he passed .</l>
     <l n="19">To the air all cool and temperate — brought him , by the flame unreached .</l>
     <l n="20">As he fain on th ’ earth would place him — thus Karkotaka began .</l>
     <l n="21">“ Move thou now , O king , and slowly — as thou movest , count thy steps .</l>
     <l n="22">Then the best of all good fortune — will I give thee , mighty armed ! ”</l>
     <l n="23">Ere the tenth step he had counted<span corresp="#note103" type="note_anchor">[ 103 ]</span>— him the sudden serpent bit :</l>
     <l n="24">As he bit him , on the instant — all his kingly form was changed .</l>
     <l n="25">There he stood , and gazed in wonder — Nala , on his altered form .</l>
     <l n="26">In his proper shape the serpent — saw the sovereign of men .</l>
     <l n="27">Then Karkotaka the serpent — thus to Nala comfort spake :</l>
     <l n="28">“ Through my power thy form is altered — lest thou should'st be known of men .</l>
     <l n="29">He through whom thou'rt thus afflicted — Nala , with intensest grief ,</l>
     <l n="30">Through my poison , shall in anguish — ever dwell within thy soul .</l>
     <l n="31">All his body steeped in poison — till he free thee from thy woe ,</l>
     <l n="32">Shall he dwell within thee prison 'd — in the ecstacy of pain .</l>
     <l n="33">So from him , by whom , thou blameless !— sufferest such unworthy wrong ,</l>
     <l n="34">By the curse I lay upon him — my deliverance shall be wrought .</l>
     <l n="35">Fear not thou the tusked wild boar — foeman fear not thou , O king ,</l>
     <l n="36">Neither Brahmin fear , nor Sages<span corresp="#note104" type="note_anchor">[ 104 ]</span>— safe through my prevailing power .</l>
     <l n="37">King , this salutary poison — gives to thee nor grief nor pain ;</l>
     <l n="38">In the battle , chief of Rajas — victory is ever thine .</l>
     <l n="39">Go thou forth , thyself thus naming — Vahuca , the charioteer ,</l>
     <l n="40">To the royal Rituparna — in the dice all-skilful he ;</l>
     <l n="41">To Ayodhya 's pleasant city — sovereign of Nishadha ! go ;</l>
     <l n="42">He his skill in dice will give thee — for thy skill in taming steeds :</l>
     <l n="43">Of Ikshwàku 's noble lineage — he will be thy best of friends .</l>
     <l n="44">Thou the skill in dice possessing — soon wilt rise again to bliss ;</l>
     <l n="45">With thy consort reunited — yield not up thy soul to grief .</l>
     <l n="46">Thou thy kingdom , thou thy children — wilt regain , the truth I speak .</l>
     <l n="47">When again thou would'st behold thee — in thy proper form , O king ,</l>
     <l n="48">Summon me to thy remembrance — and this garment put thou on :</l>
     <l n="49">In this garment clad resum'st thou — instantly thy proper form . ”</l>
     <l n="50">Saying thus , of vests celestial — gave he to the king a pair .<span corresp="#note105" type="note_anchor">[ 105 ]</span></l>
     <l n="51">And king Nala , thus instructed — gifted with these magic robes ,</l>
     <l n="52">Instantly the king of serpents — vanished from his sight away .</l>

     <l n="76">Even as thou commandedst , sits she — sadly waiting thy return .</l>
     <l n="77">Parched with sorrow sits that woman — in her scant half garment glad .</l>
     <l n="78">Oh to her thus ever weeping — in the extreme of her distress ,</l>
     <l n="79">Grant thy pity , noble hero — answer to her earnest prayer .</l>
     <l n="80">Be this also said , to move him — to compassionate my state ,</l>
     <l n="81">( By the wind within the forest — fanned , intensely burns the fire ) .<span corresp="#note117" type="note_anchor">[ 117 ]</span></l>
     <l n="82">Ever by her consort cherished — and sustained the wife should be .</l>
     <l n="83">Why hast thou forgot that maxim — thou in every duty skilled .</l>
     <l n="84">Thou wert ever called the generous — thou the gentle and the wise .</l>
     <l n="85">Art thou now estranged from pity — through my sad injurious fate .</l>
     <l n="86">Prince of men , O grant thy pity — grant it , lord of men , to me ;</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Mercy is the chief of duties , ’ — oft from thine own lips I 've heard .</l>
     <l n="88">Thus as ye are ever speaking — should there any one reply ,</l>
     <l n="89">Mark him well , lest he be Nala — who he is , and where he dwells .</l>
     <l n="90">He who to this speech hath listened — and hath thus his answer made ,</l>
     <l n="91">Be his words , O best of Brahmins — treasured and brought home to me ,</l>
     <l n="92">Lest he haply should discover — that by my command ye speak ,</l>
     <l n="93">That again ye may approach him — do ye this without delay .</l>
     <l n="94">Whether he be of the wealthy — whether of the poor he be ;</l>
     <l n="95">Be he covetous of riches — learn ye all he would desire . ”</l>
     <l n="96">Thus addressed , went forth the Brahmins — to the realms on every side ,</l>
     <l n="97">Seeking out the royal Nala — in his dark concealed distress .</l>
     <l n="98">They through royal cities , hamlets — pastoral dwellings , hermits ’ cells ,</l>
     <l n="99">Nala every-where went seeking — yet those Brahmins found him not .</l>
     <l n="100">All in every part went speaking — in the language they were taught ;</l>
     <l n="101">In the words of Damayanti — spake they in the ears of men .</l>

     <l n="1">Long the time that passed , a Brahmin — wise Parnada was his name ,</l>
     <l n="2">Home returning to the city — thus to Bhima 's daughter spake :</l>
     <l n="3">“ Damayanti ! royal Nala — as I sought Nishadha 's king ,</l>
     <l n="4">Came I to Ayodhya 's city — the Bhangasuri 's abode .</l>
     <l n="5">Stood before me , eager listening — to the words thou bad'st us speak ,</l>
     <l n="6">He , the prosperous Rituparna — all excelling ! such his name .</l>
     <l n="7">Thus as spake I , answered nothing — Rituparna , king of men ;</l>
     <l n="8">Nor of all that full assemblage — more than once addressed by me .</l>
     <l n="9">By the king dismissed , when sate I — in a solitary place ,</l>
     <l n="10">One of Rituparna 's household — Vahuca , his name , drew near ,</l>
     <l n="11">Charioteer of that great raja — with short arms and all deformed ,</l>
     <l n="12">Skilled to drive the rapid chariot — skilled the viands to prepare .</l>
     <l n="13">He , when much he 'd groaned in anguish — and had wept again , again ,</l>
     <l n="14">First his courteous salutation — made , then spake in words like these :</l>
     <l n="15">Even in the extreme of misery — noble women still preserve ,</l>
     <l n="16">Over their ownselves the mastery — by their virtues winning heaven ;</l>
     <l n="17">Of their faithless lords abandoned — anger feel not even then .</l>
     <l n="18">In the breastplate of their virtue — noble women live unharmed .</l>
     <l n="19">By the wretched , by the senseless — by the lost to every joy ,</l>
     <l n="20">She by such a lord forsaken — yet to anger will not yield .</l>
     <l n="21">Against him his sustenance seeking — of his robe by birds despoiled ,</l>
     <l n="22">Him consumed with utmost misery — still no wrath the dark-hued feels ;</l>
     <l n="23">Treated well , or ill entreated — when her husband she beholds ,</l>
     <l n="24">Spoiled of bliss , bereft of kingdom — famine-wasted , worn with woe .</l>
     <l n="25">Having heard the stranger 's language — hither hasted I to come .</l>
     <l n="26">Thou hast heard , be thine the judgment — to the king relate thou all . ”</l>
     <l n="27">To Parnada having listened — with her eyes o'erflowed with tears ,</l>
     <l n="28">Secretly went Damayanti — and her mother thus addressed :</l>
     <l n="29">“ Let not what I speak to Bhima — O my mother , be made known —</l>
     <l n="30">In thy presence to Sudeva — best of Brahmins , I would speak .</l>
     <l n="31">Let not this my secret counsel — to king Bhima be disclosed ;</l>
     <l n="32">This the object we must compass — if thy daughter thou wouldst please ,</l>
     <l n="33">As myself was to my kindred — swiftly by Sudeva brought ,</l>
     <l n="34">With the same good fortune swiftly — may Sudeva part from hence ,</l>
     <l n="35">Home to bring the royal Nala — mother , to Ayodhya 's town . ”</l>
     <l n="36">Resting from his toil , Parnada — of the Brahmin race the best ,</l>
     <l n="37">Did the daughter of Vidarbha — honour , and with wealth reward .</l>
     <l n="38">“ Brahmin ! home if come my Nala — richer guerdon will I give ;</l>
     <l n="39">Much hast thou achieved , and wisely — so as none but thou has done .</l>
     <l n="40">That again with my lost husband — noblest Brahmin , I may meet . ”</l>
     <l n="41">Thus addressed , his grateful homage — and his benedictions paid ,</l>
     <l n="42">Having thus achieved his mission — home the wise Parnada went .</l>
     <l n="43">Then accosting good Sudeva — Damayanti thus began ,</l>
     <l n="44">And before her mother 's presence — in her pain and grief she spake :</l>
     <l n="45">“ Go , Sudeva , to the city — where Ayodhya 's raja dwells ,</l>
     <l n="46">Speak thou thus to Rituparna — Come , as of thine own accord .</l>
     <l n="47">Once again her Swayembara — does king Bhima 's daughter hold ;</l>
     <l n="48">Damayanti , thither hasten — all the kings and sons of kings ;</l>
     <l n="49">Closely now the time is reckoned — when to-morrow 's dawn appears ;</l>
     <l n="50">If that thou would'st win the Princess — speed thou , tamer of thy foes .</l>
     <l n="51">When the sun is in his rising — she a second lord will choose :</l>
     <l n="52">Whether lives or is not living — royal Nala , no one knows . ”</l>
     <l n="53">Thus , as he received his mission — hastening to the king , he spake ,</l>
     <l n="54">To the royal Rituparna — spake Sudeva , in these words .</l>

     <l n="1">Hearing thus Sudeva 's language — Rituparna , king of men</l>
     <l n="2">With a gentle voice and blandly — thus to Vahuca began .</l>
     <l n="3">“ Where the princess Damayanti — doth her Swayembara hold</l>
     <l n="4">In one day to far Vidarbha — Vahuca , I fain would go . ”</l>
     <l n="5">In these words the unknown Nala — by his royal lord addressed</l>
     <l n="6">All his heart was torn with anguish — thus the lofty-minded thought —</l>
     <l n="7">“ Can she speak thus , Damayanti — thus with sorrow frantic act ?</l>
     <l n="8">Is't a stratagem thus subtly — for my sake devised and plann 'd ?</l>
     <l n="9">To desire this deed unholy<span corresp="#note118" type="note_anchor">[ 118 ]</span>— is that holy princess driven</l>
     <l n="10">Wrong 'd by me , her basest husband — miserable , mind-estranged !</l>
     <l n="11">Fickle is the heart of woman — grievous too is my offence !</l>
     <l n="12">Hence she thus might act ignobly — in her exile , reft of friends ,</l>
     <l n="13">Soul-disturbed by her great sorrow — in the excess of her despair .</l>
     <l n="14">No ! she could not thus have acted — she with noble offspring blest .</l>
     <l n="15">Where the truth , and where the falsehood — setting forth , I best shall judge ,</l>
     <l n="16">I the will of Rituparna — for mine own sake , will obey . ”</l>
     <l n="17">Thus within his mind revolving — Vahuca , his wretched mind ,</l>
     <l n="18">With his folded hands addressed he — Rituparna , king of men :</l>
     <l n="19">“ I thy mandate will accomplish — I will go , O king of men ,</l>
     <l n="20">In a single day , O raja — to Vidarbha 's royal town . ”</l>
     <l n="21">Vahuca of all the coursers — did a close inspection make</l>
     <l n="22">Entering in the royal stable — by Bhangasuri 's command .</l>
     <l n="23">Ever urged by Rituparna — Vahuca , in horses skilled ,</l>
     <l n="24">Long within himself debating — which the fleetest steeds to choose ,</l>
     <l n="25">He approached four slender coursers — fit , and powerful for the road ,</l>
     <l n="26">Blending mighty strength with fleetness — high in courage and in blood ;</l>
     <l n="27">Free from all the well-known vices — broad of nostril — large of jaw ;</l>
     <l n="28">With the ten good marks distinguished<span corresp="#note119" type="note_anchor">[ 119 ]</span>— born in Sindhu<span corresp="#note120" type="note_anchor">[ 120 ]</span>— fleet as</l>
     <l n="29">wind .</l>
     <l n="30">As he gazed upon those coursers — spoke the king , almost in wrath :</l>
     <l n="31">“ Is then thus fulfilled our mandate ?— think not to deceive us so .</l>
     <l n="32">How will these my coursers bear us — slight in strength and slightly</l>
     <l n="33">breathed —</l>
     <l n="34">How can such a way be travelled — and so long , by steeds like these ? ” —</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="35">VAHUCA spake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="36">“ Two on th ’ head , one on the forehead — two and two on either flank —</l>
     <l n="37">Two , behold , the chest discloses — and upon the crupper one —</l>
     <l n="38">These the horses to Vidharba — that will bear us , doubt not thou ;</l>
     <l n="39">Yet , if others thou preferest — speak , and I will yoke them straight . ”</l>

    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="43">Then those four excelling horses — nobly bred — of courage high ,</l>
     <l n="44">In their harness to the chariot — did the skilful Nala yoke .—</l>
     <l n="45">To the chariot yoked , as mounted — in his eager haste the king</l>
     <l n="46">To the earth those best of horses — bowed their knees and stooped them down .</l>
     <l n="47">Then the noblest of all heroes — Nala , with a soothing voice ,</l>
     <l n="48">Spake unto those horses , gifted — both with fleetness and with strength .</l>
     <l n="49">Up the reins when he had gathered — he the charioteer bade mount ,</l>
     <l n="50">First , Varshneya , skilled in driving — at full speed then set he forth .</l>
     <l n="51">Urged by Vahuca , those coursers — to the utmost of their speed ,</l>
     <l n="52">All at once in th ’ air sprung upward — as the driver to unseat .</l>
     <l n="53">Then , as he beheld those horses — bearing him as fleet as wind ,</l>
     <l n="54">Did the monarch of Ayodhya — in his silent wonder sit .</l>
     <l n="55">When the rattling of the chariot — when the guiding of the reins ,</l>
     <l n="56">When of Vahuca the science — saw he , thus Varshneya thought :</l>
     <l n="57">“ Is it Matali ,<span corresp="#note121" type="note_anchor">[ 121 ]</span>the chariot — of the king of heaven that drives ?</l>
     <l n="58">Lo , in Vahuca each virtue — of that godlike charioteer !</l>
     <l n="59">Is it Salihotra skilful — in the race , the strength of steeds ,</l>
     <l n="60">That hath ta'en a human body — thus all-glorious to behold ?</l>
     <l n="61">Is't , or can it be , king Nala — conqueror of his foemen 's realms ?</l>
     <l n="62">Is the lord of men before us ? ” — thus within himself he thought .</l>
     <l n="63">“ If the skill possessed by Nala — Vahuca possesseth too ,</l>
     <l n="64">Lo , of Vahuca the knowledge — and of Nala equal seems ;</l>
     <l n="65">And of Vahuca and Nala — thus alike the age should be .</l>
     <l n="66">If ‘ tis not the noble Nala — it is one of equal skill .</l>
     <l n="67">Mighty ones , disguised , are wandering — in the precincts of this earth .</l>
     <l n="68">They , divine by inborn nature — but in earthly forms concealed .</l>
     <l n="69">His deformity of body — that my judgment still confounds ;</l>
     <l n="70">Yet that proof alone is wanting — what shall then my judgment be ?</l>
     <l n="71">In their age they still are equal — though unlike that form misshaped ,</l>
     <l n="72">Nala gifted with all virtues — Vahuca I needs must deem . ”</l>
     <l n="73">Thus the charioteer Varshneya — sate debating in his mind ;</l>
     <l n="74">Much , and much again he pondered — in the silence of his thought .</l>
     <l n="75">But the royal Rituparna — Vahuca 's surpassing skill ,</l>
     <l n="76">With the charioteer Varshneya — sate admiring , and rejoiced .</l>
     <l n="77">In the guiding of the coursers — his attentive hand he watched ,</l>
     <l n="78">Wondered at his skill , consummate — in consummate joy himself .</l>

     <l n="1">Over rivers , over mountains — through the forests , over lakes ,</l>
     <l n="2">Fleetly passed they , rapid gliding — like a bird along the air .</l>
     <l n="3">As the chariot swiftly travelled — lo , Bhangasuri the king</l>
     <l n="4">Saw his upper garment fallen — from the lofty chariot seat ;</l>
     <l n="5">Though in urgent haste , no sooner — he his fallen mantle saw ,</l>
     <l n="6">Than the king exclaimed to Nala — “ Pause , and let us take it up :</l>
     <l n="7">Check , an instant , mighty-minded !— check thy fiery-footed steeds ,</l>
     <l n="8">While Varshneya , swift dismounting — bears me back my fallen robe . ”</l>
     <l n="9">Nala answered , “ Far behind us — doth thy fallen garment lie ;</l>
     <l n="10">Ten miles ,<span corresp="#note122" type="note_anchor">[ 122 ]</span>lo , it lies behind us — turn we not , to gain it , back . ”</l>
     <l n="11">Answered thus by noble Nala — then Bhangasuri the king ,</l>
     <l n="12">Bowed with fruit , within the forest — saw a tall Vibhitak<span corresp="#note123" type="note_anchor">[ 123 ]</span>tree :</l>
     <l n="13">Gazing on that tree , the raja — spake to Vahuca in haste ,</l>
     <l n="14">“ Now , O charioteer , in numbers , thou shalt see my passing skill .</l>
     <l n="15">Each one knows not every science — none there is that all things knows :</l>
     <l n="16">Perfect skill in every knowledge — in one mind there may not be .</l>
     <l n="17">On yon tree are leaves how many ?— Vahuca , how many fruit ?</l>
     <l n="18">Say , how many are there fallen ?— one above a hundred , there .</l>
     <l n="19">One leaf is there ‘ bove a hundred — and one fruit , O Vahuca !</l>
     <l n="20">And of leaves are five ten millions<span corresp="#note124" type="note_anchor">[ 124 ]</span>— hanging on those branches two .</l>
     <l n="21">Those two branches if thou gather — and the twigs that on them grow ,</l>
     <l n="22">On those two are fruits two thousand — and a hundred , less by five . ”</l>
     <l n="23">Then , when he had check 'd the chariot — answered Vahuca the king ,</l>
     <l n="24">“ What thou speakest , to mine eyesight — all invisible appears ;</l>
     <l n="25">Visible I 'll make it , counting — on yon boughs the leaves and fruit :</l>
     <l n="26">Then , when we have strictly numbered — I mistrust mine eyes no more .</l>
     <l n="27">In thy presence , king , I 'll number — yonder tall Vibhitak-tree .</l>
     <l n="28">Whether it may be , or may not — this not done , I cannot know .</l>
     <l n="29">I will number , thou beholding — all its fruits , O king of men ,</l>
     <l n="30">But an instant let Varshneya — hold the bridles of the steeds . ”</l>
     <l n="31">To the charioteer the raja — answered , “ Time is none to stay . ”</l>
     <l n="32">Vahuca replied , all eager — his own purpose to fulfil ,</l>
     <l n="33">“ Either stay thou here an instant — or go onward in thy speed ,</l>
     <l n="34">With the charioteer Varshneya — go , for straight the road before . ”</l>
     <l n="35">Answered him king Rituparna — with a bland and soothing voice :</l>
     <l n="36">“ Charioteer ! on earth thine equal — Vahuca , there may not be ;</l>
     <l n="37">By thy guidance , skilled in horses !— to Vidarbha I would go :</l>
     <l n="38">I in thee have placed reliance — interrupt not then our course :</l>
     <l n="39">Willingly will I obey thee — Vahuca , in what thou ask'st ,</l>
     <l n="40">If this day we reach Vidarbha — ere the sun hath sunk in night . ”</l>
     <l n="41">Vahuca replied , “ No sooner — have I numbered yonder fruit ,</l>
     <l n="42">To Vidarbha will I hasten — grant me then my prayer , O king . ”</l>
     <l n="43">Then the raja , all reluctant — “ Stay then , and begin to count ;</l>
     <l n="44">Of one branch one part , O blameless — from the tall Vibhitak tree ,</l>
     <l n="45">Man of truth , begin to number — and make glad thine inmost heart . ”</l>
     <l n="46">From the chariot quick alighting — Nala tore the branch away .</l>
     <l n="47">Then , his soul possess 'd with wonder — to the raja thus he said ;</l>
     <l n="48">“ Having counted , an thou sawest — even so many fruits there are ,</l>
     <l n="49">Marvellous thy power , O monarch — by mine eyes beheld and proved ,</l>
     <l n="50">Of that wonder-working science — fain the secret would I hear . ”</l>
     <l n="51">Then the raja spake in answer — eager to pursue his way ,</l>
     <l n="52">“ I of dice possess the science — and in numbers thus am skilled . ”</l>
     <l n="53">Vahuca replied ; “ That science — if to me thou wilt impart ,</l>
     <l n="54">In return , O king , receive thou — my surpassing skill in steeds . ”</l>
     <l n="55">Then the raja Rituparna — by his pressing need induced ,</l>
     <l n="56">Eager for that skill in horses — “ Be it so , ” thus ‘ gan to say ;</l>
     <l n="57">“ Well , O Vahuca , thou speakest — thou my skill in dice receive ,</l>
     <l n="58">And of steeds thy wondrous knowledge — be to me a meet return . ”</l>
     <l n="59">Rituparna , all his science — saying this , to Nala gave .</l>
     <l n="60">Soon as he in dice grew skilful — Kali from his body passed :</l>
     <l n="61">He Karkotaka 's foul poison — vomiting from out his mouth ,</l>
     <l n="62">Went from forth his body Kali<span corresp="#note125" type="note_anchor">[ 125 ]</span>— tortured by that fiery curse .</l>
     <l n="63">Nala , wasted by that conflict — came not instant to himself ,</l>
     <l n="64">But , released from that dread venom — Kali his own form resumed :</l>
     <l n="65">And Nishadha 's monarch , Nala — fain would curse him in his ire .</l>
     <l n="66">Him addressed the fearful Kali — trembling , and with folded hands ;</l>
     <l n="67">“ Lord of men , restrain thine anger — I will give thee matchless fame ;</l>
     <l n="68">Indrasena 's wrathful mother — laid on me her fatal curse ,<span corresp="#note126" type="note_anchor">[ 126 ]</span></l>
     <l n="69">When by thee she was deserted — since that time , O king of men ,</l>
     <l n="70">I have dwelt in thee in anguish — in the ecstacy of pain .</l>
     <l n="71">By the King of Serpents ’ poison — I have burned by night , by day ;</l>
     <l n="72">To thy mercy now for refuge — flee I , hear my speech , O king :</l>
     <l n="73">Wheresoe'er men , unforgetful — through the world shall laud thy name ,</l>
     <l n="74">Shall the awful dread of Kali<span type="note_anchor">[ 126 ]</span>— never in their soul abide .</l>
     <l n="75">If thou wilt not curse me , trembling — and to thee for refuge fled . ”</l>
     <l n="76">Thus addressed , the royal Nala — all his rising wrath suppressed ,</l>
     <l n="77">And the fearful Kali entered — in the cloven Vibhitak tree :[ 127 ]</l>
     <l n="78">To no eyes but those of Nala — visible , had Kali spoken .</l>
     <l n="79">Then the monarch of Nishadha — from his inward fever freed ,</l>
     <l n="80">When away had vanished Kali — when the fruits he had numbered all ,</l>
     <l n="81">Triumphing in joy unwonted — blazing in his splendour forth ,</l>
     <l n="82">Proudly mounting on the chariot — onward urged the rapid steeds .</l>
     <l n="83">But that tree by Kali entered — since that time stands aye accursed .</l>

     <l n="2">Mighty Rituparna 's coming — to king Bhima did proclaim .</l>
     <l n="3">Then that king , by Bhima 's mandate — entered in Kundina 's walls ,</l>
     <l n="4">All the region round him echoing<span corresp="#note128" type="note_anchor">[ 128 ]</span>— with the thunders of his car .</l>
     <l n="5">But the echoing of that chariot — when king Nala 's horses heard ,</l>
     <l n="6">In their joy they pawed and trampled<span corresp="#note129" type="note_anchor">[ 129 ]</span>— even as Nala 's self were there .</l>
     <l n="7">Damayanti , too , the rushing — of king Nala 's chariot heard .</l>
     <l n="8">As a cloud that hoarsely thunders — at the coming of the rains .</l>
     <l n="9">All her heart was thrilled with wonder — at that old familiar sound .</l>

     <l n="12">On the palace roofs the peacocks — th ’ elephants within their stalls ,</l>
     <l n="13">And the horses heard the rolling — of the mighty monarch 's car .</l>
     <l n="14">Elephants and peacocks hearing — the fleet chariot rattling on ,</l>

     <l n="17">“ How the rolling of yon chariot — filling , as it seems , th ’ earth ,</l>
     <l n="18">Thrills my soul with unknown transport — it is Nala , king of men .</l>
     <l n="19">If this day I see not Nala — with his glowing moonlike face ,</l>
     <l n="20">Him , the king with countless virtues — I shall perish without doubt .</l>
     <l n="21">If this day within th ’ embraces — of that hero 's clasping arms ,</l>
     <l n="22">I the gentle pressure feel not — without doubt I shall not live .</l>
     <l n="23">If ‘ tis not , like cloud of thunder — he that comes , Nishadha 's king ,</l>
     <l n="24">I this day the fire will enter — burning like the hue of gold .</l>
     <l n="25">In his might like the strong lion — like the raging elephant ,</l>
     <l n="26">Comes he not , the prince of princes — I shall perish without doubt .</l>
     <l n="27">Not a falsehood I remember — I remember no offence ;</l>
     <l n="28">Not an idle word remember — in his noble converse free .</l>
     <l n="29">Lofty , patient , like a hero — liberal beyond all kings ,</l>
     <l n="30">Nought ignoble , as the eunuch — even in private , may he do .</l>
     <l n="31">As I think upon his virtues — as I think by day , by night ,</l>
     <l n="32">All my heart is rent with anguish — widowed of in own beloved . ”</l>
     <l n="33">Thus lamenting , she ascended — as with frenzied mind possessed ,</l>
     <l n="34">To the palace roof 's high terrace — to behold the king of men .</l>
     <l n="35">In the middle court high seated — in the car , the lord of earth ,</l>
     <l n="36">Rituparna with Varshneya — and with Vahuca she saw ,</l>
     <l n="37">When Varshneya from that chariot — and when Vahuca came down ,</l>
     <l n="38">He let loose those noble coursers — and he stopped the glowing car .</l>
     <l n="39">From that chariot-seat descended — Rituparna , king of men ,</l>
     <l n="40">To the noble monarch Bhima — he drew near , for strength renowned .</l>
     <l n="41">Him received with highest honour — Bhima , for without due cause ,</l>
     <l n="42">Deemed not he , the mighty raja — with such urgent speed had come .</l>
     <l n="43">“ Wherefore com'st thou ! hail and welcome ” — thus that gracious king enquires ;</l>
     <l n="44">For his daughter 's sake he knew not — that the lord of men had come .</l>
     <l n="45">But the raja Rituparna — great in wisdom as in might ,</l>
     <l n="46">When nor king within the palace — nor king 's son he could behold ,</l>
     <l n="47">Nor of Swayembara heard he — nor assembled Brahmins saw .</l>
     <l n="48">Thus within his mind deep pondering — spoke of Kosala the lord .</l>
     <l n="49">“ Hither , O majestic Bhima — to salute thee am I come . ”</l>
     <l n="50">But king Bhima smiled in secret — as he thought within his mind ,</l>
     <l n="51">“ What the cause of this far journey — of a hundred Yojanas .</l>
     <l n="52">Passing through so many cities — for this cause he set not forth ;</l>
     <l n="53">For this cause of little moment — to our court he hath not come :</l>
     <l n="54">What the real cause , hereafter — haply I may chance to know . ”</l>
     <l n="55">After royal entertainment — then the king his guest dismissed :</l>
     <l n="56">“ Take then thy repose , ” thus said he — “ weary of thy journey , rest . ”</l>
     <l n="57">He refreshed , with courteous homage — of that courteous king took leave ,</l>
     <l n="58">Ushered by the royal servants — to th ’ appointed chamber went :</l>
     <l n="59">There retired king Rituparna — with Varshneya in his suite .</l>
     <l n="60">Vahuca , meantime , the chariot — to the chariot-house had led ,</l>
     <l n="61">There the coursers he unharnessed — skilfully he dressed them there ,</l>
     <l n="62">And with gentle words caressed them — on the chariot seat sate down .</l>
     <l n="63">But the woeful Damayanti — when Bhangasuri she 'd seen ,</l>
     <l n="64">And the charioteer Varshneya — and the seeming Vahuca ,</l>
     <l n="65">Thought within Vidarbha 's princess — “ Whose was that fleet chariot 's sound ?</l>
     <l n="66">Such it seems as noble Nala 's — yet no Nala do I see .</l>
     <l n="67">Hath the charioteer Varshneya — Nala 's noble science learned ?</l>
     <l n="68">Therefore did the thundering chariot — sound as driven by Nala 's self ?</l>
     <l n="69">Or may royal Rituparna — like the skilful Nala drive ,</l>
     <l n="70">Therefore did the rolling chariot — seem as of Nishadha 's king ? ”</l>
     <l n="71">Thus when Damayanti pondered — in the silence of her soul ,</l>
     <l n="72">Sent she then her beauteous handmaid — to that king her messenger .</l>

     <l n="33">“ Gaming that I lost my kingdom — ‘ twas not mine own guilty deed ,</l>
     <l n="34">It was Kali wrought within me — hence it was I fled from thee ;</l>
     <l n="35">Therefore he , in th ’ hour of trial — smitten by thy scathing curse ,</l>
     <l n="36">In the wild wood as thou wanderest — grieving night and day for me ,</l>
     <l n="37">Kali dwelt within my body — burning with thy powerful curse ,</l>
     <l n="38">Ever burning , fiercer , hotter — as when fire is heaped on fire .</l>
     <l n="39">He , by my religious patience — my devotion , now subdued ,</l>
     <l n="40">Lo ! the end of all our sorrows — beautiful ! is now at hand .</l>
     <l n="41">I , the evil one departed , hither have made haste to come ;</l>
     <l n="42">For thy sake , O round-limbed ! only ;— other business have I none .</l>
     <l n="43">Yet , O how may high-born woman — from her vowed , her plighted lord ,</l>
     <l n="44">Swerving , choose another husband — even as thou , O trembler , would'st ?</l>
     <l n="45">Over all the earth the heralds — travel by the kings command ,</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Now the daughter of king Bhima — will a second husband choose ,</l>
     <l n="47">‘ Free from every tie , as wills she — as her fancy may beseem , ’</l>
     <l n="48">Hearing this , came hither speeding — king Bhangasuri in haste . ”</l>
     <l n="49">Damayanti , when from Nala — heard she this his grievous charge ,</l>
     <l n="50">With her folded hands , and trembling — thus to Nala made reply :</l>
     <l n="51">“ Do not me , O noble-minded — of such shameless guilt suspect ,</l>
     <l n="52">Thou , when I the gods rejected — Nala , wert my chosen lord .</l>
     <l n="53">Only thee to find , the Brahmins — went to the ten regions forth ,</l>
     <l n="54">Chaunting to their holy measures — but the words that I had taught .</l>
     <l n="55">Then that Brahmin wise , Parnada — such the name he bears , O king ,</l>
     <l n="56">Thee in Kosala , the palace — of king Rituparna saw .</l>
     <l n="57">There to thee , my words addressed he — answer there from thee received .</l>
     <l n="58">I this subtle wile imagined — king of men , to bring thee here .</l>
     <l n="59">Since , beside thyself , no mortal — in the world , within the day ,</l>
     <l n="60">Could drive on the fleetest coursers — for a hundred Yojanas .</l>
     <l n="61">To attest this truth , O monarch !— thus I touch thy sacred feet ;</l>
     <l n="62">Even in heart have I committed — never evil thought ‘ gainst thee .</l>
     <l n="63">He through all the world that wanders — witness the all-seeing wind ,<span corresp="#note135" type="note_anchor">[ 135 ]</span></l>
     <l n="64">Let him now of life bereave me — if in this ‘ gainst thee I 've sinned :</l>
     <l n="65">And the sun that moveth ever — over all the world , on high ,</l>
     <l n="66">Let him now of life bereave me — if in this ‘ gainst thee I 've sinned .</l>
     <l n="67">Witness , too , the moon that permeates — every being 's inmost thought ;</l>
     <l n="68">Let her too of life bereave me — if in this ‘ gainst thee I 've sinned .</l>
     <l n="69">These three gods are they that govern — these three worlds , so let them</l>
     <l n="70">speak ;</l>
     <l n="71">This my sacred truth attest they — or this day abandon me . ”</l>
     <l n="72">Thus adjured , a solemn witness — spake the wind from out the air ;</l>
     <l n="73">“ She hath done or thought no evil — Nala , ‘ tis the truth we speak :</l>
     <l n="74">King , the treasure of her virtue — well hath Damayanti kept ,</l>
     <l n="75">We ourselves have seen and watched her — closely for three livelong years .</l>
     <l n="76">This her subtle wile she plotted — only for thy absent sake ,</l>
     <l n="77">For beside thyself no mortal — might a hundred Yojanas drive .</l>
     <l n="78">Thou hast met with Bhima 's daughter — Bhima 's daughter meets with thee ,</l>
     <l n="79">Cast away all jealous scruple — to thy bosom take thy wife . ”</l>
     <l n="80">Even as thus the wind was speaking — flowers fell showering all</l>
     <l n="81">around :[ 136 ]</l>
     <l n="82">And the gods sweet music sounded — on the zephyr floating light .</l>
     <l n="83">As on this surpassing wonder — royal Nala stood and gazed ,</l>
     <l n="84">Of the blameless Damayanti — melted all his jealous doubts .</l>
     <l n="85">Then by dust all undefiled — he the heavenly vest put on ,</l>
     <l n="86">Thought upon the King of Serpents — and his proper form resumed .</l>
     <l n="87">In his own proud form her husband — Bhima 's royal daughter saw ,</l>
     <l n="88">Loud she shrieked , the undespised — and embraced the king of men .</l>
     <l n="89">Bhima 's daughter , too , king Nala — shining glorious as of old ,</l>
     <l n="90">Clasped unto his heart , and fondled — gently that sweet infant pair .</l>
     <l n="91">Then her face upon his bosom — as the lovely princess laid ,</l>
     <l n="92">In her calm and gentle sorrow — softly sighed the long-eyed queen :</l>
     <l n="93">He , that form still mire-defiled — as he clasped with smile serene ,</l>
     <l n="94">Long the king of men stood silent — in the ecstacy of woe .</l>
     <l n="95">All the tale of Damayanti — and of Nala all the tale ,</l>
     <l n="96">To king Bhima in her transport — told Vidarbha 's mother-queen .</l>
     <l n="97">Then replied that mighty monarch — “ Nala , his ablutions done ,</l>
     <l n="98">Thus rejoined to Damayanti — I to-morrow will behold . ”</l>

     <l n="1">There a month when he had sojourned — of king Bhima taking leave ,</l>
     <l n="2">Guarded but by few attendants — to Nishadha took his way .</l>

     <l n="7">Then the son of Virasena — to king Pushkara drew near ;</l>

     <l n="17">An hereditary kingdom — may by any means be sought ,</l>

     <l n="19">Of two courses set before thee — Pushkara , the option make ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or in play to stand the hazard — or in battle stretch the bow . ”</l>
     <l n="21">By Nishadha 's lord thus challenged — Pushkara , with smile suppressed ,</l>
     <l n="22">As secure of easy victory — answered to the lord of earth ;</l>
     <l n="23">“ Oh what joy ! abundant treasures — thou hast won , again to play ;</l>

     <l n="25">Oh what joy ! again thou livest — with thy consort , mighty armed !</l>
     <l n="26">With the wealth I win bedecked — soon shall Bhima 's daughter stand ,</l>

     <l n="28">Still on thee hath dwelt my memory — still I 've waited , king , for thee ;</l>

     <l n="30">When this day the round-limbed princess — Damayanti , undespised ,</l>
     <l n="31">I shall win , I rest contented — still within mine heart she dwells . ”</l>
     <l n="32">Hearing his contemptuous language — franticly thus pouring forth ,</l>
     <l n="33">With his sword th ’ indignant Nala — fain had severed off his head .</l>
     <l n="34">But with haughty smile , with anger — glaring in his blood-red eyes ,</l>
     <l n="35">“ Play we now , nor talk we longer — conquered , thou'lt no longer talk . ”</l>
     <l n="36">Then of Pushkara the gaming — and of Nala straight began :</l>
     <l n="37">In a single throw by Nala — was the perilous venture gained ;</l>
     <l n="38">Pushkara , his gold , his jewels — at one hazard all was won !</l>
     <l n="39">Pushkara , in play thus conquered — with a smile the king rejoined :</l>
     <l n="40">“ Mine again is all this kingdom — undisturbed , its foes o'ercome .</l>
     <l n="41">Fallen king ! Vidarbha 's daughter — by thine eyes may ne'er be seen .</l>
     <l n="42">Thou art now , with all thy household — unto abject slavery sunk .</l>
     <l n="43">Not thyself achieved the conquest — that subdued me heretofore !</l>
     <l n="44">‘ Twas achieved by mightier Kali — that thou didst not , fool , perceive .</l>
     <l n="45">Yet my wrath , by him enkindled — will I not ‘ gainst thee direct ;</l>

     <l n="49">And mine unabated friendship — never shall from thee depart .</l>
     <l n="50">Pushkara , thou art my brother — may'st thou live an hundred years ! ”</l>
     <l n="51">Nala thus consoled his brother — in his conscious power and strength ,</l>
     <l n="52">Sent him home to his own city — once embracing , once again .</l>
     <l n="53">Pushkara , thus finding comfort — answered to Nishadha 's lord ,</l>
     <l n="54">Answered he to Punyasloka — bowing low with folded hands :</l>

   <p>This extract from the Ramayana has been edited by M. Chezy , with a free translation into French prose by M. Bournouf , a literal version into Latin , and a grammatical commentary and notes by the editor .</p>
   <p>Through the arts of one of his wives Kaikéyí , to whom he had made an incautious vow to grant her demand , Dasaratha is obliged to send his victorious son Rama into banishment at the very moment of his marriage with the beautiful Sita . Rama is accompanied in his exile by Lakshmana . The following episode describes the misery and distress of the father , deprived of his favourite son .</p>

    <head>THE DEATH OF YAJNADATTA .</head>
     <l n="1">Scarce Rama to the wilderness — had with his younger brother gone ,</l>
     <l n="2">Abandoned to his deep distress — king Dasaratha sate alone .</l>
     <l n="3">Upon his sons to exile driven — when thought that king , as Indra bright ,</l>
     <l n="4">Darkness came o'er him , as in heaven — when pales th ’ eclipsed sun his light .</l>
     <l n="5">Six days he sate , and mourned and pined — for Rama all that weary time ,</l>
     <l n="6">At midnight on his wandering mind — rose up his old forgotten crime .</l>
     <l n="7">His queen Kausalya , the divine — addressed he , as she rested near :</l>
     <l n="8">“ Kausalya , if thou wak'st , incline — to thy lord 's speech thy ready ear .</l>
     <l n="9">Whatever deed , or good or ill — by man , oh blessed queen , is wrought ,</l>
     <l n="10">Its proper fruit he gathers still — by time to slow perfection brought .</l>
     <l n="11">He who the opposing counsel 's weight — compares not in his judgment cool ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or misery or bliss his fate — among the sage is deemed a fool .</l>
     <l n="13">As one that quits the Amra bower — the bright Palasa 's pride to gain ,</l>
     <l n="14">Mocked by the promise of its flower — seeks its unripening fruit in vain .</l>
     <l n="15">So I the lovely Amra left<span corresp="#note141" type="note_anchor">[ 141 ]</span>— for the Palasa 's barren bloom ,<span corresp="#note142" type="note_anchor">[ 142 ]</span></l>
     <l n="16">Through mine own fatal error ‘ reft — of banished Rama , mourn in gloom .</l>
     <l n="17">Kausalya ! in my early youth — by my keen arrow at its mark ,</l>
     <l n="18">Aimed with too sure and deadly truth — was wrought a deed most fell and dark .</l>
     <l n="19">At length the evil that I did — hath fallen upon my fatal head ,<span corresp="#note143" type="note_anchor">[ 143 ]</span></l>
     <l n="20">As when on subtle poison hid — an unsuspecting child hath fed ;</l>
     <l n="21">Even as that child unwittingly — hath made the poisonous fare his food ,</l>
     <l n="22">Even so in ignorance by me — was wrought that deed of guilt and blood .</l>
     <l n="23">Unwed wert thou in virgin bloom — and I in youth 's delicious prime ,</l>
     <l n="24">The season of the rains had come — that soft and love-enkindling time .</l>
     <l n="25">Earth 's moisture all absorbed , the sun — through all the world its warmth</l>
     <l n="26">had spread ,</l>
     <l n="27">Turned from the north , its course begun — where haunt the spirits of the</l>
     <l n="28">dead !<span corresp="#note144" type="note_anchor">[ 144 ]</span></l>
     <l n="29">Gathering o'er all th ’ horizon 's bound — on high the welcome clouds</l>
     <l n="30">appeared ,<span corresp="#note145" type="note_anchor">[ 145 ]</span></l>
     <l n="31">Exulting all the birds flew round — cranes , cuckoos , peacocks , flew and</l>
     <l n="32">veered .</l>
     <l n="33">And all down each wide-water 'd shore — the troubled , yet still limpid floods ,</l>
     <l n="34">Over their banks began to pour — as o'er them hung the bursting clouds .</l>
     <l n="35">And , saturate with cloud-born dew — the glittering verdant-mantled earth ,</l>
     <l n="36">The cuckoos and the peacocks flew — disputing as in drunken mirth .</l>
     <l n="37">In such a time , so soft , so bland — oh beautiful ! I chanced to go ,</l>
     <l n="38">With quiver , and with bow in hand — where clear Sarayu 's waters flow .</l>
     <l n="39">If haply to the river 's brink — at night the buffalo might stray ,</l>
     <l n="40">Or elephant , the stream to drink ,— intent my savage game to slay ,</l>
     <l n="41">Then of a water cruise , as slow — it filled , the gurgling sound I heard ,</l>
     <l n="42">Nought saw I , but the sullen low — of elephant that sound appeared .</l>
     <l n="43">The swift well-feathered arrow I — upon the bowstring fitting straight ,</l>
     <l n="44">Toward the sound the shaft let fly — ah , cruelly deceived by fate !</l>
     <l n="45">The winged arrow scarce had flown — and scarce had reached its destined aim ,</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Ah me , I 'm slain , ’ a feeble moan — in trembling human accents came .</l>

     <l n="54">Ah , deed most profitless as worst — a deed of wanton useless guilt ;</l>
     <l n="55">As though a pupil 's hand accurs 'd<span corresp="#note146" type="note_anchor">[ 146 ]</span>— his holy master 's blood had spilt .</l>

     <l n="67">That hermit boy with knotted hair — his clothing was the black deer 's hide .</l>
     <l n="68">On me most piteous turned his look — his wounded breast could scarce respire ,</l>
     <l n="69">‘ What wrong , oh Kshatriya ,<span corresp="#note148" type="note_anchor">[ 148 ]</span>have I done — to be thy deathful arrow 's aim ,</l>
     <l n="70">The forest 's solitary son — to draw the limpid stream I came .</l>
     <l n="71">Both wretched and both blind they lie — in the wild wood all destitute ,</l>
     <l n="72">My parents , listening anxiously — to hear my home-returning foot .</l>
     <l n="73">By this , thy fatal shaft , this one — three miserable victims fall ,</l>

     <l n="83">Yet first , that gently I may die — draw forth the barbed steel from hence ,</l>
     <l n="84">Allay thy fears , no Brahmin I — not thine of Brahmin blood the offence .</l>
     <l n="85">My sire , a Brahmin hermit he — my mother was of Sudra race . '[ 150 ]</l>
     <l n="86">So spake the wounded boy , on me — while turned his unreproaching face .</l>
     <l n="87">As from his palpitating breast — I gently drew the mortal dart ,</l>
     <l n="88">He saw me trembling stand , and blest — that boy 's pure spirit seemed to part .</l>
     <l n="89">As died that holy hermit 's son — from me my glory seemed to go ,</l>
     <l n="90">With troubled mind I stood , cast down — t ’ inevitable endless woe .</l>
     <l n="91">That shaft that seemed his life to burn — like serpent venom , thus drawn out ,</l>
     <l n="92">I , taking up his fallen urn — t ’ his father 's dwelling took my route .</l>
     <l n="93">There miserable , blind , and old — of their sole helpmate thus forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="94">His parents did these eyes behold — like two sad birds with pinions shorn .</l>
     <l n="95">Of him in fond discourse they sate — lone , thinking only of their son ,</l>
     <l n="96">For his return so long , so late — impatient , oh by me undone .</l>
     <l n="97">My footsteps ’ sound he seemed to know — and thus the aged hermit said ,</l>
     <l n="98">‘ Oh , Yajnadatta , why so slow ?— haste , let the cooling draught be shed .</l>
     <l n="99">Long , on the river 's pleasant brink — hast thou been sporting in thy joy ,</l>
     <l n="100">Thy mother 's fainting spirits sink — in fear for thee , but thou , my boy ,</l>
     <l n="101">If aught to grieve thy gentle heart — thy mother or thy sire do wrong ,</l>
     <l n="102">Bear with us , nor when next we part — on the slow way thus linger long .</l>
     <l n="103">The feet of those that cannot move — of those that cannot see the eye ,</l>
     <l n="104">Our spirits live but in thy love — Oh wherefore , dearest , no reply ? ’</l>
     <l n="105">My throat thick swollen with bursting tears — my power of speech that</l>
     <l n="106">seemed to choke ,</l>
     <l n="107">With hands above my head , my fears — breaking my quivering voice , I spoke ;</l>
     <l n="108">‘ The Kshatriya Dasaratha I — Oh hermit sage , ‘ tis not thy son !</l>
     <l n="109">Most holy ones , unknowingly — a deed of awful guilt I 've done .</l>
     <l n="110">With bow in hand I took my way — along Sarayu 's pleasant brink ,</l>
     <l n="111">The savage buffalo to slay — or elephant come down to drink .</l>
     <l n="112">A sound came murmuring to my ear — ‘ twas of the urn that slowly filled ,</l>
     <l n="113">I deemed some savage wild-beast near — my erring shaft thy son had killed .</l>
     <l n="114">A feeble groan I heard , his breast — was pierced by that dire arrow keen :</l>
     <l n="115">All trembling to the spot I pressed — lo there thy hermit boy was seen .</l>
     <l n="116">Flew to the sound my arrow , meant — the wandering elephant to slay ,</l>
     <l n="117">Toward the river brink it went — and there thy son expiring lay .</l>
     <l n="118">The fatal shaft when forth I drew — to heaven his parting spirit soared ,</l>
     <l n="119">Dying he only thought of you — long , long , your lonely lot deplored .</l>
     <l n="120">Thus ignorantly did I slay — your child beloved , Oh hermit sage !</l>
     <l n="121">Turn thou on me , whose fated day — is come , thy all-consuming rage . ’</l>
     <l n="122">He heard my dreadful tale at length — he stood all lifeless , motionless ;</l>
     <l n="123">Then deep he groaned , and gathering strength — me his meek suppliant did</l>
     <l n="124">address .</l>
     <l n="125">‘ Kshatriya , ‘ tis well that thou hast turned — thy deed of murder to rehearse ,</l>
     <l n="126">Else over all thy land had burned — the fire of my wide-wasting curse .</l>
     <l n="127">If with premeditated crime — the unoffending blood thou'dst spilt ,</l>
     <l n="128">The Thunderer on his throne sublime — had shaken at such tremendous guilt .</l>
     <l n="129">Against the anchorite 's sacred head — hadst , knowing , aimed thy shaft</l>
     <l n="130">accursed ,</l>
     <l n="131">In th ’ holy Vedas deeply read — thy skull in seven wide rents had burst .</l>
     <l n="132">But since , unwitting , thou hast wrought — that deed of death , thou livest</l>
     <l n="133">still ,</l>
     <l n="134">Oh son of Raghu , from thy thought — dismiss all dread of instant ill .</l>
     <l n="135">Oh lead me to that doleful spot — where my poor boy expiring lay ,</l>
     <l n="136">Beneath the shaft thy fell hand shot — of my blind age , the staff , the stay .</l>
     <l n="137">On the cold earth ‘ twere yet a joy — to touch my perished child again ,</l>
     <l n="138">( So long if I may live ) my boy — in one last fond embrace to strain .</l>
     <l n="139">His body all bedewed with gore — his locks in loose disorder thrown ,</l>
     <l n="140">Let me , let her but touch once more — to the dread realm of Yama gone . ’</l>
     <l n="141">Then to that fatal place I brought — alone that miserable pair ;</l>
     <l n="142">His sightless hands , and hers I taught — to touch their boy that slumbered</l>
     <l n="143">there .</l>
     <l n="144">Nor sooner did they feel him lie — on the moist herbage coldly thrown ,</l>
     <l n="145">Both with a shrill and feeble cry — upon the body cast them down .</l>
     <l n="146">The mother as she lay and groaned — addressed her boy with quivering tongue ,</l>
     <l n="147">And like a heifer sadly moaned — just plundered of her new-dropped young :</l>
     <l n="148">‘ Was not thy mother once , my son — than life itself more dear to thee ?</l>
     <l n="149">Why the long way hast thou begun — without one gentle word to me .</l>
     <l n="150">One last embrace , and then , beloved — upon thy lonely journey go !</l>
     <l n="151">Alas ! with anger art thou moved — that not a word thou wilt bestow ? ’</l>
     <l n="152">The miserable father now<span corresp="#note151" type="note_anchor">[ 151 ]</span>— with gentle touch each cold limb pressed ,</l>
     <l n="153">And to the dead his words of woe — as to his living son , addressed :</l>
     <l n="154">‘ I too , my son , am I not here ?— thy sire with thy sad mother stands ;</l>
     <l n="155">Awake , arise , my child , draw near — and clasp each neck with loving hands .</l>
     <l n="156">Who now , ‘ neath the dark wood by night — a pious reader shall be heard ?</l>
     <l n="157">Whose honied voice my ear delight — with th ’ holy Veda 's living word ?</l>
     <l n="158">The evening prayer , th ’ ablution done — the fire adored with worship meet ,</l>
     <l n="159">Who now shall soothe like thee , my son — with fondling hand , my aged feet ?</l>
     <l n="160">And who the herb , the wholesome root — or wild fruit from the wood shall</l>
     <l n="161">bring ?</l>
     <l n="162">To us the blind , the destitute — with helpless hunger perishing ?</l>
     <l n="163">Thy blind old mother , heaven-resigned — within our hermit-dwelling lone ,</l>
     <l n="164">How shall I tend , myself as blind — now all my strength of life is gone !</l>
     <l n="165">Oh stay , my child , Oh part not yet — to Yama 's dwelling go not now ,</l>
     <l n="166">To-morrow forth we all will set — thy mother , and myself , and thou :</l>
     <l n="167">For both , in grief for thee , and both — so helpless , ere another day ,</l>
     <l n="168">From this dark world , but little loath — shall we depart , death 's easy prey !</l>
     <l n="169">And I myself , by Yama 's seat — companion of thy darksome way ,</l>
     <l n="170">The guerdon to thy virtues meet — from that great Judge of men will pray .</l>
     <l n="171">Because , my boy , in innocence — by wicked deed thou hast been slain ,</l>
     <l n="172">Rise , where the heroes dwell , who thence — ne'er stoop to this dark world</l>
     <l n="173">again .</l>
     <l n="174">Those that to earth return no more — the sense-subdued , the hermits wise ,</l>
     <l n="175">Priests their sage masters that adore — to their eternal seats arise .</l>
     <l n="176">Those that have studied to the last — the Veda 's , the Vedanga 's page ,</l>
     <l n="177">Where saintly kings of earth have passed — Nahusa and Yayáti sage ;</l>
     <l n="178">The sires of holy families — the true to wedlock 's sacred vow ;</l>
     <l n="179">And those that cattle , gold , or rice — or lands with liberal hands bestow ;</l>
     <l n="180">That ope th ’ asylum to th ’ oppressed — that ever love , and speak the truth ,</l>
     <l n="181">Up to the dwellings of the blest — th ’ eternal , soar thou , best loved youth .</l>
     <l n="182">For none of such a holy race — within the lowest seat may dwell ;</l>
     <l n="183">But that will be his fatal place — by whom my only offspring fell . ’</l>
     <l n="184">So groaning deep , that wretched pair — the hermit and his wife , essayed</l>
     <l n="185">The meet ablution to prepare — their hands their last faint effort made .</l>
     <l n="186">Divine , with glorious body bright — in splendid car of heaven elate ,</l>
     <l n="187">Before them stood their son in light — and thus consoled their helpless</l>
     <l n="188">state :</l>
     <l n="189">‘ Meed of my duteous filial care — I 've reached the wished for realms of</l>
     <l n="190">joy ;<span corresp="#note152" type="note_anchor">[ 152 ]</span></l>
     <l n="191">And ye , in those glad realms , prepare — to meet full soon your dear-loved</l>
     <l n="192">boy .</l>
     <l n="193">My parents , weep no more for me — yon warrior monarch slew me not ,</l>
     <l n="194">My death was thus ordained to be ;— predestined was the shaft he shot . ”</l>
     <l n="195">Thus , as he spoke , the anchorite 's son — soared up the glowing heaven afar ,</l>
     <l n="196">In air his heavenly body shone — while stood he in his gorgeous car .</l>
     <l n="197">But they , of that lost boy so dear — the last ablution meetly made ,</l>
     <l n="198">Thus spoke to me that holy seer — with folded hands above his head .</l>
     <l n="199">‘ Albeit by thy unknowing dart — my blameless boy untimely fell ,</l>
     <l n="200">A curse I lay upon thy heart — whose fearful pain I know too well .</l>
     <l n="201">As sorrowing for my son I bow — and yield up my unwilling breath ,</l>
     <l n="202">So , sorrowing for thy son shalt thou — at life 's last close repose in death . ’</l>
     <l n="203">That curse , dread sounding in mine ear — to mine own city forth I set ,</l>
     <l n="204">Nor long survived that hermit seer — to mourn his child in lone regret .</l>
     <l n="205">This day that Brahmin curse fulfilled — hath fallen on my devoted head ,</l>
     <l n="206">In anguish for any parted child — have all my sinking spirits fled .</l>
     <l n="207">No more my darkened eyes can see — my clouded memory is o'ercast ,</l>
     <l n="208">Dark Yama 's heralds summon me — to his deep , dreary , realm to haste .</l>
     <l n="209">Mine eye no more my Rama sees — and grief o'erburns , my spirits sink ,</l>
     <l n="210">As the swollen stream sweeps down the trees — that grow upon the crumbling</l>
     <l n="211">brink .</l>
     <l n="212">Oh , felt I Rama 's touch , or spake — one word his home-returning voice ,</l>
     <l n="213">Again to life should I awake — as quaffing nectar draughts rejoice ,</l>
     <l n="214">But what so sad could e'er have been — celestial partner of my heart ,</l>
     <l n="215">Than , Rama 's beauteous face unseen ,— from life untimely to depart .</l>
     <l n="216">His exile in the forest o'er — him home returned to Oudes high town ,</l>
     <l n="217">Oh happy those , that see once more — like Indra from the sky come down .</l>
     <l n="218">No mortal men , but gods I deem — moonlike , before whose wondering sight ,</l>
     <l n="219">My Rama 's glorious face shall beam — from the dark forest bursting bright .</l>
     <l n="220">Happy that gaze on Rama 's face — with beauteous teeth and smile of love ,</l>
     <l n="221">Like the blue lotus in its grace — and like the starry king above .</l>
     <l n="222">Like to the full autumnal moon — and like the lotus in its bloom ,</l>
     <l n="223">That youth who sees returning soon — how blest shall be that mortal 's doom .</l>
     <l n="224">Dwelling on that sweet memory — on his last bed the monarch lay ,</l>
     <l n="225">And slowly , softly , seemed to die — as fades the moon at dawn away .</l>
     <l n="226">“ Ah , Rama ! ah , my son ! ” thus said — or scarcely said , the king of men ,</l>
     <l n="227">His gentle hapless spirit fled — in sorrow for his Rama then ,</l>
     <l n="228">The shepherd of his people old — at midnight on his bed of death ,</l>
     <l n="229">The tale of his son 's exile told — and breathed away his dying breath .</l>

   <p>EXTRACTS FROM THE MAHABHARATA .</p>
   <p>THE BRAHMIN 'S LAMENT .</p>
   <p>The hostility of the kindred races of Pandu and Kuru forms one of the great circles of Indian fable . It fills great part of the immense poem , the Mahabharata . At this period the five sons of Pandu and their mother Kunti have been driven into the wilderness from the court of their uncle Dritarashtra at Nâgapur . The brothers , during their residence in the forest , have an encounter with a terrible giant , Hidimba , the prototype of the Cyclops of Homer , and of the whole race of giants of northern origin , who , after amusing our ancestors , children of larger growth , descended to our nurseries , from whence they are now well-nigh exploded . After this adventure the brothers take up their residence in the city of Ekachara , where they are hospitably received in the house of a Brahmin . The neighbourhood of this city is haunted by another terrible giant , Baka , whose cannibal appetite has been glutted by a succession of meaner victims . It is now come to the Brahmin 's turn to furnish the fatal banquet ; they overhear the following complaint of their host , whose family , consisting of himself , his wife , a grown up daughter , and a son a little child , must surrender one to become the horrible repast of the monster . In turn , the father , the mother , in what may be fairly called three singularly pathetic Indian elegies , enforce each their claim to the privilege of suffering for the rest .</p>

   <p>THE DELUGE .</p>
   <p>The following extract from the Mahábhárata was published by Bopp , with a German translation , ( the promised Latin version has not yet reached this country ,) with four other extracts from the same poem . It is inserted here not on account of its poetical merit , but on account of the interest of the subject . It is the genuine , and probably the earliest , version of the Indian tradition of the Flood . The author has made the following observations on this subject in the Quarterly Review , which he ventures here to transcribe .</p>
   <p>Nothing has thrown so much discredit on oriental studies , particularly on the valuable Asiatic Researches , as the fixed determination to find the whole of the Mosaic history in the remoter regions of the East . It was not to be expected that , when the new world of oriental literature was suddenly disclosed , the first attempts to explore would be always guided by cool and dispassionate criticism . Even Sir W. Jones was led away , at times , by the ardour of his imagination ; and the gorgeous palaces of the Mahabadian dynasty , which were built on the authority of the Desatir and the Dabistan , and thrown upward into an age anterior even to the earliest Indian civilisation , have melted away , and ‘ left not a wreck behind , ’ before the cooler and more profound investigations of Mr. Erskine<span corresp="#note157" type="note_anchor">[ 157 ]</span>. Sir W. Jones was succeeded by Wilford , a man of most excursive imagination , bred in the school of Bryant , who , even if he had himself been more deeply versed in the ancient language , would have been an unsafe guide . But Wilford , it is well known , unfortunately betrayed to the crafty and mercenary pundits whom he employed , the objects which he hoped to find ; and these unscrupulous interpreters , unwilling to disappoint their employer , had little difficulty in discovering , or forging , or interpolating , whatever might suit his purpose . The honest candour with which Wilford , a man of the strictest integrity , made the open and humiliating confession of the deceptions which had been practised upon him , ought for ever to preserve his memory from disrespect . The fictions to which he had given currency , only retained , and still we are ashamed to say retain , their ground in histories of the Bible and works of a certain school of theology , from which no criticism can exorcise an error once established : still , however , with sensible men , a kind of suspicion was thrown over the study itself ; and the cool and sagacious researches of men , probably better acquainted with their own language than some of the Brahmins themselves , were implicated in the fate of the fantastic and , though profoundly learned , ever injudicious reveries of Wilford .</p>
   <p>Now , however , that we may depend on the genuineness of our documents , it is curious to examine the Indian version or versions of the universal tradition of the Deluge ; for , besides this extract from the Mahábhárata , Sir W. Jones had extracted from the Bhagavata Purana another , and , in some respects , very different legend . Both of these versions are strongly impregnated with the mythological extravagance of India ; but the Purana , one of the Talmudic books of Indian tradition , as M. Bopp observes , is evidently of a much later date than the ruder and simpler fable of the old Epic . It belongs to a less ancient school of poetry , and a less ancient system of religion . While it is much more exuberant in its fiction , it nevertheless betrays a sort of apprehension lest it shall shock the less easy faith of a more incredulous reader ; it is manifestly from the religious school of the follower of Vishnu , and , indeed , seems to have some reference to one of the philosophic systems . Yet the outline of the story is the same . In the Máhábharatic version , Manu , like Noah , stands alone in an age of universal depravity . His virtues , however , are of the Indian cast — the most severe and excruciating penance by which he extorts , as it were , the favour of the deity<span corresp="#note158" type="note_anchor">[ 158 ]</span>.</p>

    <head>THE DELUGE .</head>
     <l n="1">Vivaswata 's son , a raja — and a sage of mighty fame ,</l>
     <l n="2">King of men , the first great fathers — in his glory equalled he ,</l>
     <l n="3">In his might and kingly power — Manu , and in earthly bliss ,</l>
     <l n="4">And in wonder-working penance — sire and grandsire far surpassed .</l>
     <l n="5">With his arms on high outstretching — wrought the sovereign of men ,</l>
     <l n="6">Steadily on one foot standing — penance rigorous and dread ,</l>
     <l n="7">With his downward head low-drooping — with his fixed , unwavering eyes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Dreed he thus his awful penance — many a long and weary year .</l>
     <l n="9">To the penitent with tresses — streaming loose , and wet , and long ,</l>
     <l n="10">By the margin of Wirini — thus the fish began to speak :</l>
     <l n="11">“ Blessed ! lo , the least of fishes — of the mighty fish in dread ,</l>
     <l n="12">Wilt thou not from death preserve me — thou that all thy vows fulfill'st ?</l>
     <l n="13">Since the strongest of the fishes — persecute the weaker still ,</l>
     <l n="14">Over us impends for ever — our inevitable fate .</l>
     <l n="15">Ere I sink , if thou wilt free me — from th ’ extremity of dread ,</l>
     <l n="16">Meet return can I compensate — when the holy deed is done . ”</l>
     <l n="17">Speaking thus the fish when heard he — full of pity all his heart ,</l>
     <l n="18">In his hand that fish king Manu — son of Vivaswata took .</l>
     <l n="19">Brought the son of Vivaswata — to the river shore the fish ,</l>
     <l n="20">Cast it in a crystal vessel — like the moonshine clear and bright .</l>
     <l n="21">“ Rapid grew that fish , O raja — tended with such duteous care ,</l>
     <l n="22">Cleaved to him the heart of Manu — as to a beloved son .</l>
     <l n="23">Time rolled on , and larger , larger — ever waxed that wonderous fish ,</l>
     <l n="24">Nor within that crystal vessel — found he longer space to move . ”</l>
     <l n="25">Spake again the fish to Manu — as he saw him , thus he spake :</l>
     <l n="26">“ O all prosperous ! O all gentle !— bring me to another place . ”</l>
     <l n="27">Then the fish from out the vessel — blessed Manu took again ;</l>
     <l n="28">And with gentle speed he bare him ,— Manu , to a spacious lake .</l>
     <l n="29">There the conqueror of cities ,— mighty Manu , cast him in .</l>
     <l n="30">Still he grew , that fish so wondrous — many a circling round of years .</l>
     <l n="31">Three miles long that lake expanded — and a single mile its breadth ,</l>
     <l n="32">Yet that fish with eyes like lotus — there no longer might endure ;</l>
     <l n="33">Nor , O sovereign of the Vaisyas !— might that lake his bulk contain .</l>
     <l n="34">Spake again that fish to Manu — as he saw him , thus he spake :</l>
     <l n="35">“ Bring me now , O blest and holy !— to the Ganga , ocean 's bride ,</l>
     <l n="36">Let me dwell in her wide waters — yet , O loved one , as thou wilt ,</l>
     <l n="37">Be it so ; whate'er thy bidding ,— murmur would beseem me ill ,</l>
     <l n="38">Since through thee , O blest and blameless !— to this wondrous bulk I 've</l>
     <l n="39">grown . ”</l>
     <l n="40">Thus addressed , the happy Manu — took again the fish , and bore</l>
     <l n="41">To the sacred stream of Ganga — and himself he cast him in .</l>
     <l n="42">Still it grew , as time rolled onward — tamer of thy foes ! that fish .</l>
     <l n="43">Spake again that fish to Manu — as he saw him , thus he spake :</l>
     <l n="44">“ Mightiest ! I can dwell no longer — here in Ganga 's narrow stream ;</l>
     <l n="45">Best of men ! once more befriend me — bear me to the ocean swift . ”</l>
     <l n="46">Manu 's self from Ganga 's water — took again that wondrous fish ,</l>
     <l n="47">And he brought him to the ocean ,— with his own hand cast him in .</l>
     <l n="48">Brought by Manu to the ocean — very large that fish appeared ,</l>
     <l n="49">But not yet of form unmeasured ,— spread delicious odours round .</l>
     <l n="50">But that fish by kingly Manu — cast into the ocean wide ,</l>
     <l n="51">In these words again bespake him — and he smiled as thus he spake :</l>
     <l n="52">“ Blessed ! thou hast still preserved me — still my every wish fulfilled ,</l>
     <l n="53">When the awful time approaches — hear from me what thou must do .</l>
     <l n="54">In a little time , O blessed !— all this firm and seated earth ,</l>
     <l n="55">All that moves upon its surface — shall a deluge sweep away .</l>
     <l n="56">Near it comes , of all creation — the ablution day is near ;</l>
     <l n="57">Therefore what I now forewarn thee — may thy highest weal secure .</l>
     <l n="58">All the fixed and all the moving — all that stirs , or stirreth not ,</l>
     <l n="59">Lo , of all the time approaches — the tremendous time of doom .</l>
     <l n="60">Build thyself a ship , O Manu — strong , with cables well prepared ,</l>
     <l n="61">And thyself , with the seven Sages — mighty Manu enter in .</l>
     <l n="62">All the living seeds of all things — by the Brahmins named of yore ,</l>
     <l n="63">Place thou first within thy vessel — well secured , divided well .</l>
     <l n="64">From thy ship keep watch , O hermit — watch for me , as I draw near ;</l>
     <l n="65">Horned shall I swim before thee — by my horn thou'lt know me well .</l>
     <l n="66">This the work thou must accomplish ,— I depart ; so fare thee well —</l>
     <l n="67">Over these tumultuous waters — none without mine aid can sail .</l>
     <l n="68">Doubt thou not , O lofty minded !— of my warning speech the truth . ”</l>
     <l n="69">To the fish thus answered Manu — “ All that thou requir'st , I 'll do . ”</l>
     <l n="70">Thus they parted , of each other — mutual leave when they had ta'en ,</l>
     <l n="71">Manu , raja ! to accomplish — all to him the fish had said .</l>
     <l n="72">Taking first the seeds of all things — launched he forth upon the sea ;</l>
     <l n="73">On the billowy sea , the prudent — in a beauteous vessel rode .</l>
     <l n="74">Manu of the fish bethought him ;— conscious of his thought the fish ,</l>
     <l n="75">Conqueror of hostile cities !— with his horn came floating by .</l>
     <l n="76">King of men , the born of Manu !— Manu saw the sea-borne fish ,</l>
     <l n="77">In his form foreshewn , the horned — like a mountain huge and high .</l>
     <l n="78">To the fish 's head his cable , Manu bound — O king of men !</l>
     <l n="79">Strong and firm his cable wound he — round and round on either horn :</l>
     <l n="80">And the fish , all conquering raja !— with that twisted cable bound ,</l>
     <l n="81">With the utmost speed that vessel — dragged along the ocean tide .</l>
     <l n="82">In his bark along the ocean — boldly went the king of men :</l>
     <l n="83">Dancing with the tumbling billows — dashing through the roaring spray ,</l>
     <l n="84">Tossed about by winds tumultuous — in the vast and heaving sea ,</l>
     <l n="85">Like a trembling , drunken woman — reeled that ship , O king of men .</l>
     <l n="86">Earth was seen no more , no region — nor the intermediate space ;</l>
     <l n="87">All around a waste of water — water all , and air and sky .</l>
     <l n="88">In the whole world of creation — princely son of Bharata !</l>
     <l n="89">None was seen but those seven Sages — Manu only , and the fish .</l>
     <l n="90">Years on years , and still unwearied — drew that fish the bark along ,</l>
     <l n="91">Till at length it came , where lifted — Himavan its loftiest peak .</l>
     <l n="92">There at length it came , and smiling — thus the fish addressed the sage :</l>
     <l n="93">“ To the peak of Himalaya — bind thou now thy stately ship . ”</l>
     <l n="94">At the fish 's mandate quickly — to the peak of Himavan</l>
     <l n="95">Bound the sage his bark , and ever — to this day that loftiest peak ,</l>
     <l n="96">Bears the name of Manubandhan — from the binding of the bark .</l>
     <l n="97">To the sage , the god of mercy — thus with fixed look bespake :</l>
     <l n="98">“ I am lord of all creation — Brahma , higher than all height ;</l>
     <l n="99">I in fishlike form have saved thee — Manu , in the perilous hour ;</l>
     <l n="100">But from thee new tribes of creatures — gods , asuras , men must spring .</l>
     <l n="101">All the worlds must be created — all that moves or moveth not ,</l>
     <l n="102">By an all-surpassing penance — this great work must be achieved .</l>
     <l n="103">Through my mercy , thy creation — to confusion ne'er shall run , ”</l>
     <l n="104">Spake the fish , and on the instant — to the invisible he passed .</l>
     <l n="105">Vivaswata 's son , all eager — the creation to begin ,</l>
     <l n="106">Stood amid his work confounded :— mighty penance wrought he then .</l>
     <l n="107">So fulfilled that rigorous penance — instant Manu ‘ gan create —</l>

    <note xml:id="note2" place="bottom" n="2">p. 3. l. 5 . Holy deep-read in the Vedas . All the perfections , which , according to the opinions and laws of the Hindus , distinguish the sovereign from the rest of mankind , are here ascribed to the hero of the poem . The study of the Vedas must be cultivated by the three superior castes , and ensures both temporal and eternal beatitude . In the laws of Menu it is said , “ Greatness is not conferred by years , not by grey hairs , not by wealth , not by powerful kindred . ” The divine sages have established this rule — Whoever has read the Vedas and their Angas , he is among us great . ( JONES 'S MENU , ii . 254 ) . Of all these duties , answered Bhrigu , the principal is to acquire from the Upanishads a true knowledge of the one supreme God : that is the most exalted of all sciences , because it ensures immortality , ( xii . 85 ) . For in the knowledge and adoration of one God , which the Veda teaches , all the rules of good conduct before-mentioned in order , are fully comprised , ( ib . 87 . )</note>
     <l n="1">The study of the Vedas is considered the peculiar duty of kings , ( vii .</l>
     <l n="2">43 ) . The Upanishads are doctrinal extracts of the Vedas .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The Indian law demands in the most rigorous manner from every one of noble birth , the mastery over the senses . Menu says , c. ii . 93 , “ A man by the attachment of his organs to sensual pleasure , incurs certain guilt ; but having wholly subdued them , he thence attains heavenly bliss . v. 94 . Desire is never satisfied with the enjoyment of desired objects ; as the fire is not appeased with clarified butter ; it only blazes more vehemently . v. 97 . To a man contaminated by sensuality , neither the Vedas , nor liberality , nor sacrifices , nor strict observances , nor pious austerities , ever procure felicity . ” The control over every kind of sensual indulgence is enjoined upon the king . vii . 44 . Day and night must he strenuously exert himself to gain complete victory over his own organs ; since that king alone whose organs are completely subdued , can keep his people firm to their duty .</p>
   <p>Skill in the management of horses and chariots , which in a subsequent part of the poem is of great importance to Nala , is often mentioned as a praiseworthy accomplishment of kings . In the Ramayana , for instance , in the description of king Dasaratha , which likewise contains the above-mentioned traits of character — “ In this city Ayodhya was a king named Dusharuthâ , descended from Ikshwaku , perfectly skilled in the Veda and Vedangas , prescient , of great ability , beloved by all his people , a great charioteer , constant in sacrifice , eminent in sacred duties , a royal sage , nearly equalling a Muhurshi , famed throughout the three worlds , mighty , triumphant over his enemies , observant of justice , having a perfect command of his appetites . ” CAREY and MARSHMAN 'S translation , sect . vi . p . 64 . ]</p>

Kosegarten renders it in a good sense as “ fearing heaven . ” He argues that it is the poet 's object in this passage to describe the good qualities of Nala , and that he does not become a gamester till possessed by the demon Kali . Bopp gives the sense in the text , which seems to connect it with the history of king Yudishthira , to whom it is addressed .</note>
   <note xml:id="note5" place="bottom" n="5">p. 3. l. 7 . Sense subdued . The highest notion of this favourite perfection of Indian character , may be given in the words of the author of the Bhagavat-Gita : “ The highest perfection to which the soul can attain , is action without passion . The mind is to be entirely independent of external objects ; to preserve its undisturbed serenity it should have the conscious power of withdrawing all its senses within itself , as the tortoise draws all its limbs beneath in shell . ” Action is necessary , but action must produce no emotion — no sensation on the calm spirit within ; whatever may be their consequences , however important , however awful , events are to be unfelt , and almost unperceived by the impassive mind ; and on this principle Arjuna is to execute the fated slaughter upon his kindred without the least feeling of sorrow or compunction being permitted to intrude on the divine apathy of his soul . Some of the images in which this passionless tranquillity of the spirit is described , appear singularly beautiful :</note>

   <note xml:id="note6" place="bottom" n="6">p. 3. l. 8 . Best , a present Manu he . Manu , or Menu , the representative of the human race ; the holy , mythological ancestor of the Hindus . In the Diluvium , the Indian version of the Deluge , ( see the latter part of this volume ) , Manu is the survivor of the human race — the second ancestor of mankind . The first Menu is named “ Swayambhuva , or sprung from the self-existing . ” From him “ came six descendants , other Menus , or perfectly understanding the Scripture , each giving birth to a race of his own , all exalted in dignity , eminent in power . ” Laws of Menu , i . 61 . The great code of law “ the Hindus firmly believe to have been promulged in the beginning of time by Menu , son or grandson of Brahma , or in plain English the first of created beings , and not the oldest only but the noblest of legislators . ” Sir W. JONES 'S preface to Laws of Menu ; Works , vii . 76 . In the Ramayana , in like manner , king Dasaratha is compared to the ancient king , Menu . The word Manu , as the name of the ancestor of men , is derived from the Sanscrit root Man , to know ( WILSONin voce ) ; in the same manner as the Sanscrit Maníshá , knowledge , Manushya , Man — as also the Latin Mens , and the German Mensch . According to this etymology , Man , Mensch , properly means “ the knowing , ” the Being endowed with knowledge . The German word , Meinen , to mean , or be of opinion , belongs to the same stock .</note>

According to Wilford it is Burra Nag-poor . BOPP . Colebrooke , Asiatic Researches , remarks , that some suppose it to be the modern Berar , which borders on the mountain Vindhya or Gondwanah . The kingdom of Vidarbha , and its capital Kundini , are mentioned in the very remarkable drama Malati and Madhava .

   <note xml:id="note9" place="bottom" n="9">p. 3. l. 11 . Many a holy act , on offspring . He made offerings and performed penance , by which blessings were forced from the reluctant gods . In India not only temporal , but eternal happiness , depends on having children . The son alone by the offering of the Sraddha , or libation for the dead , can obtain rest for the departed spirit of the father . Hence the begetting of a son is a religious duty , particularly for a Brahmin , and is one of the three debts to which he is bound during life . After he has read the Vedas in the form prescribed by Law , has legally begotten a son , and has performed sacrifices to the best of his power , he has paid his three debts , and may then apply his heart to eternal bliss . MENU , vi . 36 . By a son a man obtains victory over all people ; by a son 's son he enjoys immortality ; and afterwards , by the son of that grandson , he reaches the solar abode . MENU , ix . 137 .</note>
   <p>This last passage is immediately followed by the explanation of the Sanscrit word Puttra , son , by “ the deliverer from hell . ” Since the son ( trayatè ) delivers his father from the hell , named put , he was therefore called puttra by Brahma himself . This explanation , which it given by the Indian etymologists , appears nevertheless , as is often the case , rather forced ; since the final syllable , tra , which is translated by deliver ( or preserve , WILSON , in voce ) is a common ending of many words , without the peculiar signification of delivering : as with this final syllable on the word Pu , to be pure , is formed the noun Puwitra , pure . WILKINS , Grammar , p. 454 ; KOSEGARTEN . The affix with which this last is formed however , is not tra , but itra , and it affords therefore no ground of objection to the usual etymology of Puttra . WILSON .</p>
   <p>The Indian poetry is full of instances of this strong desire for offspring . In the Ramayana , king Dasaratha performs the Aswamedha , or offering of a horse , to obtain a son . “ To this magnanimous king , acquainted in every duty , pre-eminent in virtue , and performing sacred austerities for the sake of obtaining children , there was no son to perpetuate his family . At length in the anxious mind of this noble one the thought arose , ‘ Why do I not perform an Ushwamedha to obtain a son . ’ ” CAREY and MARSHMAN 's translation , sect . viii . p. 74 . Compare the Raghu Vansa , canto i ., and all that is done by king Dilipa to obtain a son : and the poem of the death of Hidimbha , published by Bopp . ]</p>

   <note xml:id="note18" place="bottom" n="18">p. 4. l. 15 . There the swans he saw disporting . In the original this is a far less poetic bird , and the author must crave forgiveness for having turned his geese into swans . If , however , we are to believe Bohlen , in his learned work , Das Alte Indien , the translators are altogether mistaken ; they have been misled by the similarity of the word Hansa to Gans — a goose . The original , he asserts , to mean a mythic bird , closely resembling the swan , or perhaps the tall and brilliant flamingo , which Southey has introduced with such effect in one of his rich descriptions in the Curse of Kehama . The goose , however , according to the general opinion , is so common in Indian mythology , that this must be received with much caution . In the modern Tamulic version of the story , translated by Mr. Kindersley , are substituted , “ Milk white Aunnays , descending from the skies , like an undulating garland of pearls . ” The Aunnays are supposed to be a sort of birds of paradise . They are represented as milk white ; remarkable for the gracefulness of their walk ; and endowed with considerable gifts . Mr. Wilson , in his Meghaduta , has given me a precedent for the change of geese into swans ; see p. 27 , v. 71 , with the note . And Mr. Ellis , Asiatic Researches , vol . xiv . p. 29 , has the following note on the subject : “ There are three distinctions of Hamsa ; the Raja-hamsa , with a milk-white body and deep red beak and legs , this is the Phenicopteros , or flamingo ; the Mallicácsha-hamsa , with brownish beak and legs ; and the Dhartarashtra-hamsa , with black beak and legs : the latter is the European swan , the former a variety . The gait of an elegant woman is compared by the Hindu poets to the proud bearing of a swan in the water . Sonnerat , making a mistake similar to that in the text , translates a passage in which this allusion occurs , in words to the following purport , ‘ Her gait resembled that of a goose . ’ Other writers have fallen into the same error . ” The swans , ou Plutôt les Génies ailès , play the same part in an extract from the Harivansa , translated by M. Langlois , in his Monumens Littéraires de l'Inde , Paris , 1827 , p. 158 . The first part of the Harivansa has just appeared , under the auspices of the Oriental Translation Committee .</note>

The provision in the ninth book ( v. 90 ) , appears to belong to the lower classes .— “ Three years let a damsel wait , though she be marriageable ; but after that term let her choose for herself a bridegroom of equal rank . ” In the Raghuvansa , a poem , parts of which the author of this translation , if he could command leisure to make himself better acquainted with Sanscrit , would consider well worthy of being introduced to the English reader , there is a very remarkable and beautiful book , describing a Swayembara .

Schlegel and Rosen consider that a sloka , describing the attributes of Varuna , has been lost — that in this line ‘ varanam , seligendum ’ should be written instead of ‘ Varunam . ’ The Calcutta edition has the same reading , however , and the change is not necessary : if any alteration be made it should probably be in the first word , and ‘ Vriyatám ’ be read in place of ‘ Kriyatám . ’ WILSON .</note>

The month is divided into thirty lunar days ( tithis ) , which are personified as nymphs . See the Dissertation on the lunar year by Sir W. JONES , Asiatic Researches , iii . 257 . In the Laws of Menu are multifarious directions concerning the day of the moon fit or unfit for particular actions . “ The dark lunar day destroys the spiritual teacher ; the fourteenth destroys the learner ; the eighth and the day of the full moon destroy all remembrance of Scripture ; for which reason he must avoid reading on those lunar days . ”</note>

The literal rendering is , ‘ they entered the hall ( the stage , or place of exhibition , a spacious court or quadrangle ) splendid with columns of gold , and brilliant with a portal ; a temporary or triumphal arch ( torana ) . ’ There is allusion to such a porch or portal in the Mudrá Rakshasa ( Hindu Theatre , ii . 181 , 182 ) , also in the Toy Cart , ( i . 82 ) . For gold pillars see CRAWFURD 's description of the Hall of Audience at Ava .</note>
   <p>“ The roof is supported by a great number of pillars : with the exception of about fourteen or fifteen inches at the bottom of each pillar , painted of a bright red , the whole interior of the palace is one blaze of gilding — although little reconcilable to our notions of good taste in architecture , the building is unquestionably most splendid and brilliant , and I doubt whether so singular and imposing a royal edifice exists in any other country . ” Embassy to Ava , 133 .

   <note xml:id="note46" place="bottom" n="46">p. 15. l. 22 . Nala 's form might not discern . The form of the gods , as it is here strikingly described by the poet , differs from that of men by the absence of those defects which constitute the inferiority of a mortal body to that of the inhabitants of the Indian heaven . The immortal body does not perspire , it is unsoiled by dust , the garlands which they wear stand erect , that is , the flowers are still blooming and fresh . The gods are further distinguished by their strong fixed gaze , and by floating on the earth without touching it . They have no shadow . Nala 's form is the opposite of all these .

Hence a deity is called ‘ Animisha ’ or ‘ Animesha , ’ one whose eyes do not twinkle . ” Mr. Wilson , in his note to Vikrama and Urvasi , ( Hindu Theatre , i . 237. p . 60 . ) , quotes this passage , and suggests that the “ marble eyes of Venus , by which Helen knew the goddess , and which the commentators and translators seem to be much perplexed with , are probably the ‘ stabdha lochana , ’ the fixed eyes of the Hindus , full and unveiled for an instant , like the eyes of a marble statue . ” Mr. Wilson has , I think , been misled by the words ὁμματα μαρμαἱροντα , which rather expresses the contrary . Μαρμαἱρω is to glitter , and is applied in many places in Homer to the gleaming of armour . The μαρμαριγἀς θηεἴτο ποδὤν of the Odyssey is well translated by Gray , “ glance their many-twinkling feet . ” In Mr. Wilson 's curious reference to Heliodorus ( the passage is in the Æthiopica , iii . 13 . ) the author appears to write from Egyptian rather than Grecian notions . He extorts , somewhat violently , a meaning from Homer 's words , δεινὼ δἐ εἱ ἔσσε φἁανθην , which they by no means necessarily bear ; but the analogy is as curious if Egyptian as if Grecian .</note>

   <note xml:id="note56" place="bottom" n="56">p. 20. l. 5 . Nala in the dusky twilight , etc . This is rather an unmanageable passage ; but the Latin translation has not rendered its purport correctly . ‘ Upaspris ’ can in no case mean ‘ calcare : ’ it implies touching , and especially touching or sipping water , as part of the ceremony of purification . As Menu ; “ Let each man sprinkle the cavities of his body , and taste water in due form , etc . ” In the text of this passage , ‘ upaspris ’ is used for touching or sprinkling . In others , it is used in the sense of ablution , bathing . In the lexicons it is explained ‘ upasparsa sparsamátre , snánáchamanay-orapi , touch in general , ablution , sipping water . ’ In the Mitákshara , on the subject of personal purification , the direction is , after evacuations , ‘ Dwijo nityam upaspriset , Let the man of two births always perform the upaspersa , ’ i. e. says the commentator , ‘ áchámet , let him sip water . ’ The sense of the passage of the text is , ‘ that Nala sat down to evening prayer ; ( as Menu directs , he who repeats it sitting at evening twilight , etc .,) after performing his purifications , and sipping water , but without having washed his feet , such ablution being necessary not because they had been soiled , but because such an act is also part of the rite of purification . As the Mitakshara , ‘ etasmát páda prakshálana prápti , after that purification , comes the washing of the feet , ’ especially prior to any religious act . So Colebrooke : “ Having washed his hands and feet , and having sipped water , the priest sits down to worship . ” A. R. v. 363 . WILSON .</note>

In that country was a famous city called Ayodhya , built formerly by Munoo , the lord of men . A great city , twelve yojanas in extent , the houses of which stood in triple and long-extended rows . It was rich , and perpetually adorned with new improvements ; the streets and valleys were admirably disposed , and the principal streets well watered . It was filled with merchants of various descriptions , and adorned with abundance of jewels ; difficult of access , filled with spacious houses , beautified with gardens , and groves of mango trees , surrounded by a deep and impassable moat , and completely furnished with arms ; was ornamented with stately gates and porticoes , and constantly guarded by archers , etc . etc . ” Ramayana , translated by CAREY and MARSHMAN , vol . i. p. 60 .</note>

   <p>Ibid . p. 115 .</p>
   <p>In Indian mythology , eclipses are caused by the dragon Rahu attempting to swallow up the moon . The origin of their hostility is given in a passage quoted by Mr. Wilkins from the Mahabharata , in his notes to the Bhagavat-Gita :— “ And so it fell out that when the Soors were quenching their thirst for immortality , Rahu , an Asoor , assumed the form of a Soor , and begun to drink also ; and the water had but reached his throat , when the sun and moon , in friendship to the Soors , discovered the deceit , and instantly Narayan cut off his head as he was drinking , with his splendid weapon , chakra . And the gigantic head of the Asoor , emblem of a monstrous summit , being thus separated from his body by the chakra 's edge , bounded into the heavens with a dreadful cry , whilst the ponderous trunk fell , cleaving the ground asunder , and shaking the whole earth unto its foundations , with all its islands , rocks , and forest . And from this time the head of Rahu resolved on eternal enmity , and continueth even unto this day at times to seize upon the sun and moon . ” p . 149 . ]</p>

    <head>THE DESCENT OF THE GANGES .</head>
    <head>FIRST PRINTED IN THE QUARTERLY REVIEW , VOL . XLV .</head>
    <head>The descent of the Ganges is the sequel of another fiction still more monstrous , but perhaps one of the most singular of the cosmogonical notions of the ancient Indians . Sagara , the king of Ayodhya ( Oude ) , was without offspring — in almost all eastern countries the most grievous calamity incident to man , more especially to those of noble or royal race . By the most surpassing penances he obtains an oracle from the wise Brighu , predicting that one of his wives will bring forth a single son , the other sixty thousand ! Accordingly the fair Cesina gives birth to Asamanja ; his other wife to a gourd , which , like the egg of Leda , is instinct with life . From the seeds of this gourd , preserved with great care , and fed with ghee , come forth in due time the sixty thousand boys . The son of Cesina was a youth of the most malicious and cruel disposition ; his pastime was to throw little infants into the river , and solace himself with their cries . He is sent into exile by his just and humane father , where he has a son , Ansuman , as gentle and popular as Asamanja was malignant and odious . King Sagara prepares to offer the Aswameda , the famous sacrifice of the horse . The holy and untouched steed is led forth , as in the ‘ Curse of Kehama , ’ among the admiring multitude , by the youthful Ansuman , when on a sudden a monstrous serpent arises from the earth , and drags it into the abyss . Sagara , in wrath , commands his sixty thousand sons to undertake the recovery of the steed from the malignant demon who has thus interrupted the sacrifice . Having searched long in vain , they begin to dig into the bowels of the earth , until ,—</head>
     <l n="1">‘ Cloven with shovel and with hoe , pierced by axes and by spades ,</l>
     <l n="2">Shrieked the earth in frantic woe ; rose from out the yawning shades</l>
     <l n="3">Yells of anguish , hideous roars from the expiring brood of hell —</l>
     <l n="4">Serpents , giants , and Asoors , in the deep abyss that dwell .</l>
     <l n="5">Sixty thousand leagues in length , all unweary , full of wrath ,</l>
     <l n="6">Through the centre , in their strength , clove they down their hellward path . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The gods , expecting the whole frame of the world , thus undermined , to perish in total ruin , assemble around Brahma to implore his interposition . He informs them that Vishnu , in the form of Kapila , has been the robber of the horse , and that in due time the god will avenge himself . From Patala , the hell of Indian mythology , the Sagaridæ recommence their impious and destructive work .</p>
   <p>‘ And downward dug they many a rood , and downward till they saw aghast , Where the earth-bearing elephant stood , ev'n like a mountain tall and vast . ‘ Tis he whose head aloft sustains the broad earth 's forest-clothed round , With all its vast and spreading plains , and many a stately city crown 'd . If underneath the o'erbearing load bows down his weary head , ‘ tis then The mighty earthquakes are abroad , and shaking down the abodes of men . Around earth 's pillar moved they slowly , and thus in humble accents blest Him the lofty and the holy , that bears the region of the East . And southward dug they many a rood , until before their shuddering sight , The next earth-bearing elephant stood , huge Mahapadmas ’ mountain height . Upon his head earth 's southern bound , all full of wonder , saw they rest . Slow and awe-struck paced they round , and him , earth 's southern pillar , blest . Westward then their work they urge , king Sagara 's six myriad race , Unto the vast earth 's western verge , and there in his appointed place The next earth-bearing elephant stood , huge Saumanasa 's mountain crest ; Around they paced in humble mood , and in like courteous phrase addrest , And still their weary toil endure , and onward dig until they see Last earth-bearing Himapandure , glorying in his majesty . ’</p>
   <p>At length they reach the place where Vishnu appears in the form of Kapila , with the horse feeding near him ; a flame issues forth from the indignant deity , and the six myriad sons of Sagara become a heap of ashes .</p>
   <p>The adventure devolves on the youthful Ansuman , who achieves it with perfect success ; Vishnu permits him to lead away the steed , but the ashes of his brethren cannot be purified by earthly water ; the goddess Ganga must first be brought to earth , and , having undergone lustration from that holy flood , the race of Sagara are to ascend to heaven . Yet a long period elapses ; and it is not till the reign of the virtuous Bhagiratha , that Brahma is moved by his surpassing penance to grant the descent of Ganga from heaven . King Bhagiratha had taken his stand on the top of Gokarna , the sacred peak of the Himavan , ( the Himalaya ,) and here</p>

   <p>His prayers are irresistible ; but Brahma forewarns him , that the unbroken descent of Ganga from heaven would be so overpowering , that the earth would be unable to sustain it , and Siva must be propitiated , in order that he may receive on his head the precipitous cataract . Under this wild and unwieldy allegory appears to lurk an obscure allusion to the course of the Ganges among the summits , and under the forests of the Himalaya , which are the locks of Siva .</p>

   <p>The king again has recourse to his penances , Siva is propitiated , and the stream by seven<span corresp="#note159" type="note_anchor">[ 159 ]</span>channels finds its way to the plains of India . The spirit and the luxuriance of the description which follows , of the king leading the way , and the obedient waters rolling after his car , appear to us of a high order of poetry .</p>
   <p>‘ Up the raja at the sign upon his glittering chariot leaps , Instant Ganga the divine follows his majestic steps , From the high heaven burst she forth first on Siva 's lofty crown , Headlong then and prone to earth thundering rushed the cataract down . Swarms of bright-hued fish came dashing ; turtles , dolphins in their mirth , Fallen or falling , glancing , flashing , to the many gleaming earth . And all the host of heaven came down , spirits and genii , in amaze , And each forsook his heavenly throne , upon that glorious scene to gaze . On cars , like high tower 'd cities , seen , with elephants and coursers , rode , Or on soft swinging palanquin , lay wondering each observant god . As met in bright divan each god , and flash 'd their jewell 'd vestures ’ rays , The coruscating æther glow 'd , as with a hundred suns ablaze . And with the fish and dolphins gleaming , and scaly crocodiles and snakes , Glanc 'd the air , as when fast streaming the blue lightning shoots and breaks : And in ten thousand sparkles bright went flashing up the cloudy spray , The snowy flocking swans less white , within its glittering mists at play . And headlong now poured down the flood , and now in silver circlets wound , Then lakelike spread all bright and broad , then gently , gently flowed around , Then ‘ neath the cavern 'd earth descending , then spouted up the boiling tide , Then stream with stream harmonious blending , swell bubbling up or smooth subside . By that heaven-welling water 's breast , the genii and the sages stood , Its sanctifying dews they blest , and plung 'd within the lustral flood . Whoe'er beneath the curse of heaven from that immaculate world had fled , To th ’ impure earth in exile driven , to that all-holy baptism sped ; And purified from every sin , to the bright spirit 's bliss restor 'd , Th ’ etherial sphere they entered in , and through th ’ empyreal mansions soar 'd . The world in solemn jubilee behold these heavenly waves draw near , From sin and dark pollution free , bathed in the blameless waters clear . Swift king Bhagiratha drave upon his lofty glittering car , And swift with her obeisant wave bright Ganga followed him afar . ’</p>
   <note xml:id="note159" place="bottom" n="159">Schlegel supposes the three western streams to be the Indus , which appears under its real name the Sind , the Iaxartes , and the Oxus ; are not the Sareswatie , or perhaps the Sutlej , under the name of Sita , and the Jumna meant ? Of the eastern branches , it is not difficult to fix the Burhampooter . Schlegel suggests the Irawaddy , and the Blue River of China . Why not the Alacananda and the Gogra ? The main stream bears the name of the Bhaghiratha , till it joins the Alacananda and takes the name of the Ganges .</note>
