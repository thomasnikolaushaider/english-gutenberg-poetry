    <docImprint>Little Ann and her mother were walking one day Through<settlement>London</settlement>'s wide city so fair , And business obliged them to go by the way That led them through Cavendish Square . And as they pass 'd by the great house of a Lord , A beautiful chariot there came , To take some most elegant ladies abroad , Who straightway got into the same . The ladies in feathers and jewels were seen , The chariot was painted all o'er , The footmen behind were in silver and green , The horses were prancing before . Little Ann by her mother walk 'd silent and sad , A tear trickled down from her eye , Till her mother said , “ Ann , I should be very glad To know what it is makes you cry . ” “ Mamma , ” said the child , “ see that carriage so fair , All cover 'd with varnish and gold , Those ladies are riding so charmingly there While we have to walk in the cold . “ You say God is kind to the folks that are good , But surely it cannot be true ; Or else I am certain , almost , that He would Give such a fine carriage to you . ” “ Look there , little girl , ” said her mother , “ and see What stands at that very coach door ; A poor ragged beggar , and listen how she A halfpenny tries to implore . “ All pale is her face , and deep sunk is her eye , And her hands look like skeleton 's bones ; She has got a few rags , just about her to tie , And her naked feet bleed on the stones . ” ‘ Dear ladies , ’ she cries , and the tears trickle down , ‘ Relieve a poor beggar , I pray ; I 've wander 'd all hungry about this wide town , And not ate a morsel to-day . ‘ My father and mother are long ago dead , My brother sails over the sea , And I 've scarcely a rag , or a morsel of bread , As plainly , I 'm sure , you may see . ‘ A fever I caught , which was terrible bad , But no nurse or physic had I ; An old dirty shed was the house that I had , And only on straw could I lie . ‘ And now that I 'm better , yet feeble and faint , And famish 'd , and naked , and cold , I wander about with my grievous complaint , And seldom get aught but a scold . ‘ Some will not attend to my pitiful call , Some think me a vagabond cheat ; And scarcely a creature relieves me , of all The thousands that traverse the street . ‘ Then ladies , dear ladies , your pity bestow : ’ — Just then a tall footman came round , And asking the ladies which way they would go , The chariot turn 'd off with a bound . “ Ah ! see , little girl , ” then her mother replied , “ How foolish those murmurs have been ; You have but to look on the contrary side , To learn both your folly and sin . “ This poor little beggar is hungry and cold , No mother awaits her return ; And while such an object as this you behold , Your heart should with gratitude burn . “ Your house and its comforts , your food and your friends , ‘ Tis favour in God to confer , Have you any claim to the bounty He sends , Who makes you to differ from her ? “ A coach , and a footman , and gaudy attire , Give little true joy to the breast ; To be good is the thing you should chiefly desire , And then leave to GOD all the rest . ”</docImprint>

       <l n="3">They came by a fine orchard 's side :</l>
       <l n="4">They would rather eat apples than spell , read , or play ,</l>

       <l n="22">And brought them both into the room .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="8">
       <l n="23">And he smiled , and he laugh 'd , and caper 'd with joy ,</l>
       <l n="24">His little companions to greet :</l>
       <l n="25">“ And we too are happy , ” said each little boy ,</l>

       <l n="33">And near the high wall when those little boys came ,</l>

       <l n="7">In harmless sport or healthful play</l>

       <l n="15">And then enjoy the joke !</l>
       <l n="16">Or , if a window open stood ,</l>
       <l n="17">He 'd throw in stones , or bits of wood ,</l>

       <l n="23">Rejoiced to see them taken in ,</l>

       <l n="25">He 'd tie a string across the street ,</l>

      <head>THE APPLE-TREE .</head>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">Old John had an apple-tree , healthy and green ,</l>
       <l n="2">Which bore the best codlins that ever were seen ,</l>
       <l n="3">So juicy , so mellow , and red ;</l>
       <l n="4">And when they were ripe , he disposed of his store ,</l>
       <l n="5">To children or any who pass 'd by his door ,</l>
       <l n="6">To buy him a morsel of bread .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="7">Little Dick , his next neighbour , one often might see ,</l>
       <l n="8">With longing eye viewing this fine apple-tree ,</l>
       <l n="9">And wishing a codlin might fall :</l>
       <l n="10">One day as he stood in the heat of the sun ,</l>
       <l n="11">He began thinking whether he might not take one ,</l>
       <l n="12">And then he look 'd over the wall .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="3">
       <l n="13">And as he again cast his eye on the tree ,</l>
       <l n="14">He said to himself , “ Oh , how nice they would be ,</l>
       <l n="15">So cool and refreshing to-day !</l>
       <l n="16">The tree is so full , and one only I 'll take ,</l>
       <l n="17">And John cannot see if I give it a shake ,</l>
       <l n="18">And nobody is in the way . ”</l>

      <lg type="stanza" n="4">
       <l n="19">But stop , little boy , take your hand from the bough ,</l>

       <l n="21">And no one to chide you is nigh ,</l>

       <l n="25">O then little boy , come away from the tree ,</l>
