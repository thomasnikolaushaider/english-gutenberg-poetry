    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Whatever other excellence may be wanting in the ensuing Poems , they are , with only nine exceptions out of the hundred , strictly Sonnets . Those nine vary only from the rules of the legitimate Sonnet in that they rhime three , instead of four times in the first part . The pause is in them , as in the rest , variously placed through the course of the verses ; and thus they bear no more resemblance than their associates , to those minute Elegies of twelve alternate rhimes , closing with a couplet , which assume the name of Sonnet , without any other resemblance to that order of Verse , except their limitation to fourteen lines . I never found the quadruple rhimes injurious to the general expression of the sense , but in the excepted instances . When it is considered how few they are in so large a number , I flatter myself the idea will vanish that our language is not capable of doing justice to the regular Sonnet .</p>
    <p n="2">From the Supplement to the Gentleman 's Magazine for 1786 , I shall insert Mr. White 's definition of the nature and perfection of this species of Verse , because I think it explains them with justness and precision .</p>
    <p n="3">“ Little Elegies , consisting of four stanzas and a couplet , are no more Sonnets than they are Epic Poems . The Sonnet is of a particular and arbitrary construction ; it partakes of the nature of Blank Verse , by the lines running into each other at proper intervals . Each line of the first eight , rhimes four times , and the order in which those rhimes should fall is decisive . For the ensuing six there is more licence ; they may , or may not , at pleasure , close with a couplet .</p>
    <p n="4">“ Of Milton 's English Sonnets , only that to Oliver Cromwell ends with a couplet , but the single instance is a sufficient precedent ; however , in three out of his five Italian ones , the concluding lines rhime to each other .</p>
    <p n="5">“ The style of the Sonnet should be nervous , and , where the subject will with propriety bear elevation , sublime ; with which , simplicity of language is by no means incompatible . If the subject is familiar and domestic , the style should , though affectionate , be nervous ; though plain , be energetic . The great models of perfection , for the sublime and domestic Sonnet , are those of Milton 's , ‘ To the Soldier to spare his Dwelling-place ,’ and ‘ To Mr. Laurence .’</p>
    <p n="6">“ The Sonnet is certainly the most difficult species of poetic composition ; but difficulty , well subdued , is excellence . Mrs. Smith says she has been told that the regular Sonnet suits not the nature or genius of our language . Surely this assertion cannot be demonstrated , and therefore was not worth attention .</p>
    <p n="7">“ Out of eighteen English Sonnets , written by Milton , four are bad . The rest , though they are not free from certain hardnesses , have a pathos and greatness in their simplicity , sufficient to endear the legitimate Sonnet to every Reader of just taste . They possess a characteristic grace , which can never belong to three elegiac stanzas , closing with a couplet .”</p>
    <p n="8">I have pleasure in quoting the preceding Dissertation on the SONNET , conscious that there is no order of Verse , upon which so much erroneous opinion has gone forth , and of whose beauties the merely common Reader is so insensible . But when the Author of this just Treatise says of the assertion , that the legitimate Sonnet suits not our language , “ its truth cannot be demonstrated ,” he should perhaps rather have observed , that its fallacy is proved by the great number of beautiful legitimate Sonnets , which adorn our National Poetry , not only by Milton , but by many of our modern Poets .</p>
    <p n="9">Of the four of Milton 's , justly disapproved by Mr. White , there is one evidently a burlesque , written in sport . It begins ,</p>
    <p n="10">“ A book was writ of late , call 'd Tetrachordon .”</p>
    <p n="11">Doctor Johnson has the disingenuousness , in his Folio Dictionary , under the word SONNET , to cite that Sonnet at full length , as a specimen of Milton 's style in this kind of Poetry . Johnson disliked Sonnets , and he equally disliked Blank Verse , and Odes . It is in vain to combat the prejudice of splenetic aversion . The Sonnet is an highly valuable species of Verse ; the best vehicle for a single detached thought , an elevated , or a tender sentiment , and for a succinct description . The compositions of that order now before the Reader , ensued from time to time , as various circumstances impressed the heart , or the imagination of their Author , and as the aweful , or lovely scenes of Nature , arrested , or allured her eye .</p>

    <head>TO MISS SEWARD ,</head>
    <head>ON READING HER CENTENARY OF SONNETS .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Dear are the forceful energies of Song ,</l>
     <l n="2">For they do swell the spring-tide of the heart</l>
     <l n="3">With rosier currents , and impel along</l>
     <l n="4">The life-blood freely :— O ! they can impart</l>
     <l n="5">Raptures ne'er dreamt of by the sordid throng</l>
     <l n="6">Who barter human feeling at the mart</l>
     <l n="7">Of pamper 'd selfishness , and thus do wrong</l>
     <l n="8">Imperial Nature of her prime desert .—</l>
     <l n="9">SEWARD ! thy strains , beyond the critic-praise</l>
     <l n="10">Which may to arduous skill its meed assign ,</l>
     <l n="11">Can the pure sympathies of spirit raise</l>
     <l n="12">To bright Imagination 's throne divine ;</l>
     <l n="13">And proudly triumph , with a generous strife ,</l>
     <l n="14">O'er all the “ flat realities of life .”</l>

     <l n="3">Thou wanderest thro ’ the amaranthine glades ,</l>
     <l n="4">While social joys the devious walk endear !</l>

     <l n="5">Or whether in the bright Elysian bowers ,</l>
     <l n="6">Where the tall vine its lavish mantle spreads ,</l>
     <l n="7">Thou crown'st the goblet with unfading flowers ,</l>
     <l n="8">Sooth 'd by the murmuring stream , that labors thro ’ the meads .</l>

     <l n="9">Hear , happy Bard !— to wake thy silent lyre</l>
     <l n="10">Our British Muse , our charming Seward , deigns !—</l>
     <l n="11">With more harmonious tones , more sportive fire</l>
     <l n="12">Beneath her hand arise the potent strains .</l>

     <l n="13">Then , as thou hear'st the sweet Enthusiast , own</l>
     <l n="14">Thy fancy 's various florets look 'd less gay</l>

     <l n="9">No more young Hope tints with her light and bloom</l>

     <l n="5">That gild the days to come .— She still relies</l>
     <l n="6">The Phantom HAPPINESS not thus shall glide</l>
     <l n="7">Always from life .— Alas !— yet ill betide</l>
     <l n="8">Austere Experience , when she coldly tries</l>

     <l n="10">Ah ! is it wise to anticipate our pain ?</l>
     <l n="11">Arriv 'd , it then is soon enough to mourn .</l>
     <l n="12">Nor call the dear Consoler false and vain ,</l>
     <l n="13">When yet again , shining through april-tears ,</l>

     <l n="3">Each transient , gleaming interval we hail ,</l>

How dear the comforts my rash sorrows scorn !— Affection is repaid by causeless hate ! A plighted love is chang 'd to cold disdain !

   <p>1 : Of the Poets , who were cotemporary with Lord Shaftsbury , Dryden , Cowley , Pope , Prior , Congreve , Gay , Addison , &amp; c. in the Period which this Age styles AUGUSTAN , his Lordship speaks with sovereign scorn . In his Characteristics he , without making any exception , labors to prove , that the compositions of Dryden are uniformly contemptible . See his advice to an Author in the second Volume of the Characteristics , and also his miscellaneous reflections in the third Volume ; “ If ,” says he to the authors , “ your Poets are still to be Mr. Bayses , and your prose writers Sir Rogers , without offering at a better manner , must it follow that the manner is good , and the wit genuine ?”</p>
   <p>Thus it is that the jealousy People of literary fame often feel of each other , produces the foolish , and impolitic desire of decrying the general pretensions of the Age to Genius . Their narrow selfishness leads them to betray the common cause , which it is their true interest to support . They persuade the credulous Many , with whom envy of superior talents increases their willingness to despise , that Imagination is become enervated ; designing , however , to have it understood , that in their individual instance exists the sole exception ,</p>

Contrary to all expectation he survived three more years , subject , through their progress , to the same frequent and dreadful attacks , though in their intervals he was serene and apparently free from pain or sickness .</p>

     <l n="1">Cou 'd aweful Johnson want poetic ear ,</l>
     <l n="2">Fancy , or judgment ?— no ! his splendid strain ,</l>
     <l n="3">In prose , or rhyme , confutes that plea .— The pain</l>
     <l n="4">Which writh 'd o'er Garrick 's fortunes , shows us clear</l>
     <l n="5">Whence all his spleen to GENIUS .— Ill to bear</l>
     <l n="6">A Friend 's renown , that to his own must reign ,</l>
     <l n="7">Compar 'd , a Meteor 's evanescent train ,</l>
     <l n="8">To Jupiter 's fix 'd orb , proves that each sneer ,</l>
     <l n="9">Subtle and fatal to poetic Sense ,</l>
     <l n="10">Did from insidious ENVY meanly flow ,</l>
     <l n="11">Illumed with dazzling hues of eloquence ,</l>
     <l n="12">And Sophist-Wit , that labor to o'er-throw</l>
     <l n="13">Th ’ awards of AGES , and new laws dispense</l>
     <l n="14">That lift the mean , and lay the MIGHTY low .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>1 : When Johnson 's Idolaters are hard pressed concerning his injustice in those fallacious though able pages ;— when they are reminded that he there tells us the perusal of Milton 's Paradise Lost is a task , and never a pleasure ;— reminded also of his avowed contempt of that exquisite Poem , the LYCIDAS ;— of his declaration that Dryden 's absurd Ode on the death of Mrs. Anne Killegrew , written in Cowley 's worst manner , is the noblest Ode in this Language ;— of his disdain of GRAY as a lyric Poet ; of the superior respect he pays to Yalden , Blackmore , and Pomfret ;— When these things are urged , his Adorers seek to acquit him of wilful misrepresentation by alledging that he wanted ear for lyric numbers , and taste for the higher graces of POETRY :— but it is impossible so to believe , when we recollect that even his prose abounds with poetic efflorescence , metaphoric conception , and harmonious cadence , which in the highest degree adorn it , without diminishing its strength . We must look for the source of his injustice in the envy of his temper . When Garrick was named a Candidate for admission into the Literary Club , Dr. Johnson told Mr. Thrale he would black-ball him . “ Who , Sir ? Mr. Garrick ! Companion of your Youth ! your acknowledged Friend !” “ Why , Sir , I love my little David better than any , or all of his Flatterers love him ; but surely we ought to sit in a Society like ours , ‘ unelbow 'd by a Gamester , Pimp , or PLAYER .” See Supplement to Dr. Johnson 's Letters , published by Mrs. Piozzi . The blended hypocrisy and malice of this sally show the man . Johnson knew , at times , how to coax without sincerity as well as to abuse without justice . His seeming fondness for Mrs. C —— of Lichfield , on his visits to that City , and the contempt with which he spoke of her to her Townspeople , was another instance of the same nature .</p>

   <p>1 : In jargon , like the following , copied from a REVIEW , are the works of Genius perpetually criticized in our public Prints : “ Passion has not sufficient coolness to pause for metaphor , nor has metaphor ardor enough to keep pace with passion .”— Nothing can be less true . Metaphoric strength of expression will burst even from vulgar and illiterate minds when they are agitated . It is a natural effort of roused sensibility in every gradation , from unlettered simplicity to the highest refinement . Passion has no occasion to pause for metaphors , they rush upon the mind which it has heated . Similies , it is true , are not natural to strong emotion . They are the result of spirits that are calm , and at leisure to compare .</p>

   <p>PARAPHRASES AND IMITATIONS OF HORACE .</p>
   <p>PREFACE .</p>
   <p>Translations scrupulously faithful are apt to be stiff , vapid and obscure , from the often irreconcilably different nature of languages , from local customs , and from allusions to circumstances over which time has drawn a veil . In attempting to put the most admired and interesting of Horace 's Odes into English Verse , I have taken only the Poet 's general idea , frequently expanding it , to elucidate the sense , and to bring the images more distinctly to the eye ; induced by the hope of thus infusing into these Paraphrases the spirit of original composition . Neither have I scrupled to follow the example of Dryden and Pope , by sometimes adding ideas and imagery congenial to the subject , and thus to translate Horace like a Poet , rather than a Versifier .</p>
   <p>The trust , whether partial or not , that it was in my power so to paraphrase the Odes of Horace , prompted the late Mr. Grove of Lichfield , and the late Mr. Dewes of Wellsburn in Warwickshire , to request that I would undertake the task respecting those whose subjects best pleased me . Not acquainted with each other , the coincidence of their opinion and request was flattering . They were extensively known to be Gentlemen of distinguished virtues , much classic erudition , and poetic taste ;</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Blest with each talent , and each art to please ,</l>
     <l n="2">And born to write , converse , and live at ease .”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Mr. Dewes was the highly esteemed Friend of Dr. Parr , Mr. Grove of Lord Sheffield . A beautiful epitaph in verse , written by Mr. Grove , on his beloved Wife , is one of the chief ornaments of Lichfield Cathedral .</p>
   <p>The imitation of the Ode to Delius , applied to Mr. Erskine , was written since the lamented death of those Gentlemen , which happened in the meridian of their days . All the other Paraphrases had been submitted to their revision and correction , and had been honoured by their warm praise . That consciousness makes me indifferent to the expected cavils of illiberal criticism .</p>
   <p>Men of letters have often observed to me , that in paraphrasing Horace , my sex would be an unpardonable crime with every Pedant , whether within , or without the pale of professional criticism . It is not in their power to speak or write more contemptuously of my Horatian Odes than the Critics of Dryden 's and Pope 's time , in the literary journals of that Period , wrote of their Translations from Homer , Virgil , Horace , Boccace , and Chaucer . Instances of that public abuse are triumphantly inserted by Warburton in his Edition of Pope 's works . See Appendix to the Dunciad . It is re-published there , to justify some of the personal severities of Pope 's celebrated Satire .</p>
   <p>Most of the notes to the ensuing Paraphrases are addressed to their unlearned Readers , since no allusion can interest which is not perfectly comprehended .</p>

   <p>1 : The Romans , in general , made no regular meal till the business of the day was over . They considered a mid-day feast as a mark of indolence and luxury .</p>
   <p>2 : “ Diis miscent superis . ] A manner of expression not unusual amongst the Greeks and Latins , for any eminent degree of happiness . Unless we adopt this explanation of the words , says Dacier , we shall make Horace guilty of a manifest contradiction , since a few lines farther he tells his Patron , that his suffrage , not the ivy crown is that , which will exalt him to the skies . The judicious emendation of the late Bishop of Chichester , who for Me doctarum , reads Te doctarum , removes all objection ; and adds beauty to the Ode by the fine compliment it contains to Mæcenas .” BROM .

   <p>1 : He had twice been Consul ; was of Brutus ’ and Cassius ’ party , but went over to Augustus , who received him with kind respect . However he revolted from him , persuaded by the Friends of Marc Antony , that the Battle of Actium would decree the Empire to that General . The event , so contrary , brought Munatius back to the feet of Augustus , but he was not received with former kindness , nor did he deserve it , and retired , chagrined , to his fine seat at Tivoli , in the wood of Tiburnus , so called from the neighbouring city , Tibur . There also , and near the falls of Tivoli , described at full in Mr. Gray 's letters , Horace had a villa . The Poet , perceiving the spirits of Munatius dejected , writes this Ode to reconcile him to his destiny , and to inspire him with delight in the beautiful Scenery by which he was surrounded ; insinuating , that should Augustus banish him , which was no improbable event , he ought not to despond , but to form his conduct upon the spirited example of Teucer ; who , together with his Friends and Followers , was banished from his native City , Salamis , by his Father , because he had not revenged upon the Greeks the death of his Brother Ajax .— The disinterested design of this Ode , and the humane attention it pays to a disgraced Nobleman , are much to the Poet 's honor , who was perhaps , in general , more disposed to gratulate the Powerful , than to sooth the Unfortunate .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">

     <l n="3">3 : Mitylene , the chief City of Lesbos , praised by Cicero for its</l>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>6 : This surely must be the Poet 's meaning in mentioning his own villa , when he is endeavouring to awaken in Munatius a taste for the surrounding beauties of his more magnificent seat . Commentators rationally conclude that some connecting lines have been lost from the latin of this Ode . It appears to me , that the idea which those dismembered lines conveyed , must necessarily have been the comparison added in the four ensuing lines , which makes the transition easy .</p>

   <p>1 : This Ode is addressed to his Friend , an illustrious Roman , who had lost a beloved Son . The poetic literature of Titus Valgius is ascertained by the honourable mention made of him by Horace , in his Tenth Satire , Book the First . Valgius , like Sir Brooke Boothby , in these days , had poured forth a train of elegiac Sorrows over the blight of his filial hopes . Horace does not severely reprove these woes , he only wishes they may not be eternal , and that he will , at least , suspend them and share the public joy ; for this Ode was composed while the splendid victories , which Augustus had obtained in the East , were recent .</p>
   <p>2 : The Caspian is a stormy and harbourless Sea — Yet the Poet observes that not even the Caspian is always tempestuous — insinuating , that inevitable as his grief must be for such a loss , it yet ought not to be incessant .</p>
   <p>3 : The coldness of Armenia is well known , surrounded as it is by the high mountains of Niphates , Taurus , Pariades , Antiaurus , and Ararat , which are always covered with snow .</p>
   <p>4 : VESPER — alike the Evening and Morning Star — appearing first and remaining last in the Horizon , it ushers in both the Evening and the Dawn . In the first instance it is called Vesper , or Hesperus , in the last Lucifer , or Phospher .</p>
   <p>5 : Filial Hopes . Antilochus , the Son of Nestor , observing his Father likely to fall in Battle , by the sword of his Adversary , threw himself between the Combatants , and thus sacrificed his own life to preserve that of his Parent .</p>
   <p>6 : By the Rivers Medus , and Niphates , are meant the Parthians , or Scythians , for they are the same people , and the Armenians . The River Tigris , rising in the cold Mountain , Niphates , Horace gives its name to the Stream , as he does that of Medus to the Euphrates , which Plato asserts to have been formerly so called . Uniting those Rivers in his verse , the Poet means to denote the Roman Conquest over two Enemies widely distant from each other .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">7 : The Scythians , or Parthians , were a warlike People , famous for</l>
     <l n="2">their Equestrian prowess , for the speed of their horses , and for the</l>

   <p>1 : Licinius Murena was a Patrician of high rank , one of the Brothers of Proculeius , whose fraternal generosity is celebrated in the Ode to Sallust , the ninth of these Paraphrases . The property of Licinius had been confiscated for having borne arms against the second Triumvirate . Upon this confiscation Proculeius divided two thirds of that large fortune , with which the Emperor had rewarded his valor and fidelity in the royal cause , between Licinius , and his adopted Brother , Terentius , whose fortunes had suffered equal wreck on account of the Party he had taken . Horace wrote this Ode soon after the affectionate bounty of Proculeius had restored his Friend to affluence . It breathes a warning spirit towards that turbulent , and ambitious temper , which Horace perceived in this young Nobleman . The Poet , however , has used great address and delicacy , making the reflections not particular but general ; and he guards against exciting the soreness People feel from reprehension for their prevailing fault , by censuring with equal freedom the opposite extreme . That kind caution insinuated in this Ode , proved eventually vain , as did also the generosity of the Emperor , who soon after permitted Licinius to be chosen Augur ;— probably at the intercession of his Favorite Mæcenas , who had married Terentia , a Daughter of that House , and whom Horace calls Licinia in the Ode which is next paraphrased . Upon the election of Licinius to this post of honor , trust , and dignity , we perceive the spirits of Horace greatly elevated ; probably as much from the pleasure he knew Mæcenas would take in the promotion of his Brother-in-law , as from the attachment himself bore to Licinius . A peculiar air of hilarity shines out in the Ode addressed to Telephus , written the evening on which this Licinius , then newly chosen Augur , gave his first supper to his Friends . The Reader will find it somewhat lavishly paraphrased in the course of this Selection . By the above Ode the Poet seems to have feared the seditious disposition of Licinius :— but when he afterwards strung his lyre to notes of triumph for the honors of his Friend , he little imagined that Friend would finally suffer death for ungratefully conspiring against the Monarch , who had so liberally overlooked his former enmity .</p>
   <p>2 : Epidemic Diseases were , by the Pagans , believed to be the effect of having offended Apollo . The arrows he shoots among the Greeks in the first Book of the Iliad , produce the Pestilence , which follows the rape of his Priest 's Daughter , Chryseis . When we consider the dependence of the human constitution upon the temperate , or intemperate influence of the Sun , the avenging bow of Phœbus appears an obvious allegory ;— and since it is in the hours of health that the fine Arts are sought and cultivated , the Sun , under the name of Phœbus , Apollo , &amp; c. is with equal propriety of fable , supposed their Patron , as well as the Avenger of crimes by the infliction of diseases .</p>

     <l n="57">1 : Of that artful caution , which marks the character of Horace , this</l>
     <l n="58">Ode forms a striking instance . He declines the task appointed by his</l>
     <l n="59">Patron , that of describing the Italian Wars , because he foresees that</l>
     <l n="60">in its execution he must either disoblige the Emperor , and his</l>
     <l n="61">Minister , by speaking too favorably of their Enemies , or offend some</l>
     <l n="62">Friends , whom he yet retained amongst those , who had exerted</l>
     <l n="63">themselves against the Cæsars . Horace endeavours to soften the effect</l>
     <l n="64">of this non-compliance by a warm panegyric upon Licinia , the</l>
     <l n="65">betrothed bride of Mæcenas . She is in other places called Terentia .</l>
     <l n="66">Both these names have affinity to those of her Brothers , Licinius ,</l>
     <l n="67">afterwards Augur , and her adopted Brother , Terentius .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Horace mentions plainly the Numantian Wars , and those with Hannibal , but artfully speaks of those of Brutus , and Cassius , and of the Character of Antony , under fabulous denomination , sufficiently understood by Augustus , and his Minister . Dacier justly observes how easy it is to discern , that by the Lapithæ , and Giants , defeated by Hercules on the plains of Thessaly , the Poet means the Armies of Brutus , and Cassius , defeated by Augustus , almost in the same place , at the Battle of Philippi . He concludes also that by Hylæus is meant Mark Antony , who assumed the name of Bacchus , and ruined himself by his profligate passion for Cleopatra . Another Commentator observes , that as the Giants , and Lapithæ , are said to have made the Palace of Saturn shake , so also did Brutus , and Cassius , and afterwards Mark Antony , make all Italy tremble , and that it is Rome itself that Horace would have to be understood by the magnificent Palace of Saturn . Some Critics seek to destroy all the common sense , beauty , and character of this Ode , by denying the allegoric interpretation ; and also by insisting that Licinia was the Poet 's own Mistress , and not the mistress of his Patron . It had been absurd , and inconceivably unmeaning , if , when he was requested to sing the triumphs of Augustus in the Italian Wars , he should , during the brief mention of them , have adverted to old fables , uniting them , not as a simile , but in a line of continuation with the Numantian , and Carthaginian Wars ; unless , beneath those fables , he shadowed forth the Roman Enemies of Augustus .</p>
   <p>The idea that Licinia was the Mistress of Horace , has surely little foundation :— for it were strange indeed if he could take pleasure in describing amorous familiarities between Mæcenas , and the Person with whom himself was in love . One of these Critics alledges , as the reason why this Lady could not be the destined Bride of Mæcenas , that it would have been as indiscreet in him to have admitted Horace to be a witness of his passion for Licinia-Terentia , as it would have been impertinent in the Poet , to have invaded the privacies of his Patron . It is not necessary , from this Ode , to conclude that Horace had witnessed the tender scene he describes . He might , without any hazard of imputed impertinence , venture to paint , from his imagination , the innocently playful endearments of betrothed Lovers . The picture was much more likely to flatter than to disgust the gay , and gallant Mæcenas .</p>

   <p>1 : At the feast , held in honor of Licinius Murena having been chosen Augur , Horace endeavours to turn the conversation towards gayer subjects than Grecian Chronology , and the Trojan War , upon which his Friend Telephus had been declaiming ; and for this purpose seems to have composed the ensuing Ode at table . It concludes with an hint , that the unpleasant state of the Poet 's mind , respecting his then Mistress , incapacitates him for abstracted themes , which demand a serene and collected attention , alike inconsistent with the amorous discontent of the secret heart , and with the temporary exhilaration of the spirits , produced by the occasion on which they were met . This must surely be the meaning of Horace in this Ode , however obscurely expressed . People of sense do not , even in their gayest conversation , start from their subject to another of total inconnexion . When the latent meaning in the concluding verses is perspicuously paraphrased , it accounts for the Poet 's preference at that period , of trifling to literary subjects . These slight , and often obscure allusions , closely , and what is called faithfully translated , give a wild and unmeaning air to the Odes of Horace , which destroys their interest with the unlearned admirers of Poetry . To give distinct shape and form to these embryo ideas , often capable of acquiring very interesting form and shape , is the aim of these Paraphrases .</p>
   <p>Telephus , who was a Greek , appears to have been a Youth of noble birth — being mentioned as such in the Ode to PHYLLIS , which will be found farther on amongst these Paraphrases . From that to LYDIA , so well known , and so often translated , we learn that he had a beautiful form , and was much admired by the Roman Ladies .</p>

   <p>1 : The Reader will remember , that in the course of these Paraphrases the design has been avowed of stretching the pictures of Horace upon a wider canvass , of filling up what are so often mere outlines . If learned eyes ever glance over this Ode , it is hoped they will not frown upon the many circumstances and reflections which have been added , upon a presumption , induced by the pleasing nature of the subject , since the Roman customs and manners are preserved with fidelity . Those customs and manners , resulting from their festal , gay , and picturesque Religion , cannot surely be presented without proving interesting . Yet , to create this interest , stronger and more circumstantial description seems required than can be found in Horace , if the Paraphraser may be allowed to judge of the poetic feelings of others by her own . It was doubtless sufficient for his contemporary Readers , and for those of some succeeding Generations , that he slightly alluded to events and ceremonies , which were familiar to their recollection . In our day more precision is demanded , at least by those who have poetic taste without knowledge of the dead languages , or intimacy with the national and domestic customs of that Time , and of that People . Also , to strengthen this necessary interest in the mind of the Reader , it must be eligible to infuse a more liberal portion of those sentiments and ideas , which speak to the Heart in every Age , and in every Climate .</p>
   <p>To Scholars the fascinating music of the Latin tones and measures , and the elegance with which Horace knew to select , and to regulate them , recompense the obscurity which is so frequent in his allusions , and in the violence of his transitions from one subject to another , between which the line of connexion is with difficulty traced . What is called a faithful translation of these Odes cannot , therefore , be interesting to unlearned Lovers of Verse , how alive soever they may be to poetic beauty .— A literal translation in the plainest prose , will always shew the precise quantity of real poetic matter , contained in any Production , independent of the music of its intonation , and numbers , and the elegance of its style .— The prose translations of Horace ’ Odes evince that their merit does not consist in the plenitude of poetic matter , or essence , constituted by circumstances of startling interest , by exalted sentiment , impassioned complaint , or appeal , distinct and living imagery , happy apposite allusion , and sublime metaphor ; but in certain elegant verbal felicities and general charm of style , produced by the force and sweetness of the Latin Language , subservient to the fine ear , the lively and exquisite taste of Horace . These are the graces which we find so apt to evaporate in Translation , while genuine POETIC MATTER , as defined above , is capable of being transfused into any other Language without losing a particle of its excellence , provided the Chemist , who undertakes the operation , has genius and skill . The more this POETIC MATTER in an Author abounds , the more close and faithful a Translator , who has judgment , may venture to render his version — but to transfuse merely verbal felicities into another Language is an attempt scarcely less fruitless than to clasp the Rainbow . A kindred nothingness , as to poetic value , ensues . There is , however , a considerable , though not abounding quantity of poetic matter , or essence in Horace ; but it bears no proportion to the profusion of those evanescent glories , which will not bear the grasp of another Language . To give that essence in increased quantity , and in the freedom of unimitative numbers , is attempted in this selection . Dryden and Pope translated upon that plan , and hence their Paraphrases have the spirit of original Poems .</p>
   <p>Ere this note closes , its Author desires to observe , that Painters cannot take a striking likeness of a face , in which there is no predominant feature , and the Poet can only make his image , or description , distinct , animated , and forcible , by bringing forward some characteristic trait of the object he is presenting .</p>
   <p>When Horace says in this Ode , “ How pleasing is it to see the well-fed sheep hastening home ,” the observation is not picturesque , and therefore does not strongly impress the Imagination ; but when he adds —“ to see the weary Oxen dragging , with languid neck , the inverted Ploughshare ,” he gives perhaps the most poetic feature in this Ode . Had he only said , “ to see the Oxen returning from their labor ,” his Oxen had been as much without character as his Sheep , and the sentence must have passed unimpressive over the mind of the Reader . It is the words — dragging , with languid neck , the inverted ploughshare , that makes the sentence Poetry , and empowers it to arrest and charm the fancy . Had Horace always written thus , undeviating fidelity had been the best aim of his Translator , and the sure way of rendering him delightful in every Language .</p>
   <p>2 : Dacier observes that Vines supported on the highest Trees produce Wines of the most exquisite flavor .</p>
   <p>3 : The feast of Terminus , one of the rural Gods , was held on the first of February , at which time , in those warm climates , the spring is very forward .</p>
   <p>4 : The Romans fancied that the struggle and terror of a kid on being seized by the Wolf , made its flesh more tender .</p>
   <p>5 : Ides , the middle of a month .</p>
   <p>6 : Calends , the beginning of the next month .</p>
