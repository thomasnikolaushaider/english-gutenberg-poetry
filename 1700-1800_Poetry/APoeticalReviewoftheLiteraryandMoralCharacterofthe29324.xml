    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The eighteenth century was an age addicted to gossiping about its literary figures . This addiction was nowhere better demonstrated than by the countless reflections , sermons , poems , pamphlets , biographical sketches , and biographies about Samuel Johnson . The most productive phase of this activity commenced almost immediately after Johnson 's death in December , 1784 , and continued into the next century .</p>
    <p n="2">One item of Johnsoniana which seems to have been neglected , perhaps because Birkbeck Hill did not include it in his Johnsonian Miscellanies , is A Poetical Review of the Literary and Moral Character of the Late Samuel Johnson , L. L. D ., with Notes . This poem of three hundred and four lines was written by John Courtenay ( 1741-1816 ) . First published in the spring of 1786 by Charles Dilly , the poem went through three editions in the same year . Its popularity was determined less by Courtenay 's poetic talent than by public interest in the Johnsoniana that flooded the market . Courtenay 's literary output , though scanty , was diverse ; he wrote light verse , character sketches , and essays , including two controversial pieces in support of the French Revolution .<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>It is apparent , however , that for him writing was hardly more than an avocation .</p>
    <p n="3">Despite his notoriety as a controversial member of Parliament , as a first-rate wit , and as an intimate friend of Boswell , Courtenay remains a shadowy figure . References to him occur often in the last volumes of Boswell 's journal , but few of them are particularly revealing . Courtenay evidently never met Johnson ; indeed , the anonymous author of A Poetical Epistle from the Ghost of Dr. Johnson to His Four Friends : The Rev . Mr. Strahan . James Boswell , Esq . Mrs. Piozzi . J. Courtenay , Esq . M. P . ( 1786 ) censures Courtenay for writing about a man whom he did not know . Although a member of the Literary Club , Courtenay did not join this group until four years after Johnson died . He was proposed on 9 December 1788 , by Sir Joshua Reynolds ( Boswell seconded ) , and elected two weeks later , on 23 December , during the same meeting at which it was decided to erect a monument to Dr. Johnson in Westminster Abbey .<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span></p>
    <p n="4">If , then , Courtenay did not belong to the Johnson circle , he became , shortly after Johnson 's death , a valued member of the Boswell circle . Courtenay must have met Boswell in the spring or early summer of 1785 , about thirteen years after arriving in England from his native Ireland in the service of Viscount Townshend . Boswell 's first reference to Courtenay occurs in his journal under 7 July 1785 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>It is clear from this entry that he had met Courtenay earlier , but subsequent references indicate that the acquaintance was a fresh one .</p>
    <p n="5">From the start Boswell enjoyed Courtenay 's company . In the first place , Boswell appreciated Courtenay 's talent in conversation . Although he seldom recorded specimens of Courtenay 's talk , Boswell was generous in his praise of his wit . “ Courtenay 's wit , ” he wrote , “ sparkles more than almost any man 's . "[ 4 ] On 26 March 1788 , Boswell described him as a “ valuable addition ” to a meeting of the Essex Head Club which he attended as Boswell 's guest . “ Indeed , ” Boswell continued , “ his conversation is excellent ; it has so much literature , wit , and at the same time manly sense , in it . "[ 5 ] An example of his “ manly sense ” that “ struck home ” to Boswell was Courtenay 's remark that had Johnson been born to three thousand pounds a year his melancholy would have been at greater leisure to torment him .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span></p>
    <p n="6">But there was a greater reason for Courtenay 's intimacy with Boswell . The period following Johnson 's death was for Boswell a time of intense anxiety . By 1786 Courtenay and Edmond Malone had become Boswell 's closest confidants . Boswell relished the long walks and the dinners he took with Courtenay . Throughout his journal he confessed to the therapeutic value of Courtenay 's company ; “ I am , ” he admitted , “ quite another Man with M. C ., Malone , Courtenay . "[ 7 ]</p>
    <p n="7">Moreover , Boswell often solicited Courtenay 's advice in various crises . Courtenay , together with Malone , helped him out of scrapes with Alexander Tytler and Lord Macdonald , induced him to lighten his published attacks on Mrs. Piozzi and helped make him aware of the merit of her edition of Johnson 's correspondence , and advised him to cancel some questionable passages in the Life on William Gerard Hamilton . From time to time he also cautioned Boswell not to expect political preferment when he did not deserve it . It appears , too , that he took part in the prolonged deliberations over Johnson 's monument in Westminster Abbey . Concerned that Boswell 's drinking might impede his work on the Life , Courtenay made him promise to quit drinking from December 1790 , to the following March , a promise which , as far as he was able , Boswell kept .<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span></p>
    <p n="8">Courtenay 's high spirits and his ability to relieve Boswell 's melancholy were all the more remarkable because Courtenay , with a wife and seven children to support , was poverty-stricken during most of this period . Boswell , lamenting the failure of the Whigs to provide financial assistance to one of the party 's most active members , found Courtenay 's “ firmness of mind ... amazing ” under such difficulties .<span type="note_anchor">[ 9 ]</span>No doubt Courtenay 's resolve endeared him to Boswell , whose own financial and psychological problems were , of course , a great burden .</p>
    <p n="9">This is not to say that relations between the two men were always cordial . Courtenay was evidently a non-believer , and the two men often differed on religious matters . Boswell condemned Courtenay 's “ wild ravings ” in favor of the French revolution , and once confessed his deep regret about quarreling with so close a friend on this subject .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span>They also differed on the question of slavery , and Boswell good-naturedly chided Courtenay and William Windham as abolitionists in his poem , No Abolition of Slavery ; or the Universal Empire of Love ( 1791 ) .<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>It is clear , too , that as Boswell 's depression grew , Courtenay 's power to brighten his spirits waned considerably . Their friendship , nevertheless , seems to have ended on a happy note , for Boswell 's final mention of Courtenay in his journal includes the remark that with Courtenay he had spent a “ good day . "[ 12 ]</p>
    <p n="10">Courtenay 's Poetical Review , characterized by Donald A. Stauffer as an embodiment of the “ vice-and-virtue philosophy ” in biography , was one of the most spirited pieces of Johnsoniana to appear .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span>The poem begins with disdain , but at line sixty-one reverses direction and becomes vigorously commendatory . Courtenay did not attempt to add fresh information about Johnson 's life and career . Consequently , the unfavorable portion of the poem is a conventional catalog of Johnson 's often publicized foibles and prejudices , just as the favorable section is in part a commonplace survey of his artistic achievement .</p>
    <p n="11">This contrast , as Stauffer remarks , renders Courtenay 's praise more powerful .<span type="note_anchor">[ 14 ]</span>More important , the play between scorn and praise reflects the ambivalence which colors contemporary accounts of Johnson . We are now accustomed to the notion of great art as the product of a flawed life . But in the eighteenth century , an age largely devoted to the idea of discreet biography which concealed or minimized the subject 's weaknesses , a man like Johnson presented formidable problems to the biographer and his readers . Although Courtenay merely versified material which other writers had discussed in much more detail , his poem is important because it synthesizes the conflicting attitudes towards Johnson which prevailed immediately after his death . Courtenay , like many others , saw in Johnson a powerful mixture of great virtues and vices ; and though he is not impartial , he effects , through his honesty , an admirable balance between Johnson 's strengths and weaknesses . The final forty lines of the Review constitute one of the most balanced of all contemporary tributes to Johnson as a human being .</p>
    <p n="12">For the most part , the commendatory section of the poem is an unsystematic tracing of Johnson 's moral and literary merits . Courtenay 's rhapsodizing on the Dictionary , the Rambler , and the Lives of the Poets is conventional . Clearly , he admired the wide scope of Johnson 's learning and his ability to communicate his knowledge of men and manners in his writings . But his admiration occasionally betrays him ; for instance , in describing the “ brilliant school ” through which Johnson 's influence was perpetuated , he overestimated the extent to which Reynolds , Malone , Burney , Jones , Goldsmith , Steevens , Hawkesworth , and Boswell were indebted to Johnson 's writings .<span type="note_anchor">[ 15 ]</span>Usually , however , he was on firmer ground . Courtenay was the only writer before Boswell to praise Johnson 's Latin verse , a body of poetry virtually ignored by other contemporary biographers and memorialists .<span type="note_anchor">[ 16 ]</span>Furthermore , he employs footnotes skillfully . Though they impede the progress of the poem , they do support poetic statement with factual evidence and explain and amplify certain points made in the verses .</p>
    <p n="13">The clearest evidence for the care which Courtenay took with the Review can be found upon examination of his revisions . He made few substantial changes in the second edition , but the third edition contains important revisions . Courtenay added ten lines and five footnotes in the final version , and lightened some of the scorn in the first portion by substituting weaker phrases for stronger ones . He also enclosed lines seven through twenty in quotation marks to make it appear that the sentiment expressed therein was not his own , but a judgment he had heard elsewhere .</p>
    <p n="14">But the most significant revisions are concerned with organization . By transferring segments of certain verse paragraphs to others , he achieves a more unified portrait of Johnson . By means of such revision , he forms his general evaluation of Johnson 's writing into one unit and his comments on individual works into another , where before they had been awkwardly interwoven .</p>
    <p n="15">Courtenay 's Review did not go unnoticed at the time , though for obvious reasons it was given less attention by the reviewers than the more notorious Johnsoniana . Extracts from the poem were printed in several magazines . The reviewers were almost unanimous in damning the poem 's inelegance , unevenness , and lack of harmony , but reserved praise for the sentiments and candor .<span type="note_anchor">[ 17 ]</span>Chesterfield 's apologist in William Hayley 's Two Dialogues ; Containing a Comparative View of the Lives , Characters , and Writings of Philip , the Late Earl of Chesterfield , and Dr. Samuel Johnson ( 1787 ) protested that Courtenay was too kind to Johnson . The severest indictment of the Review came from the anonymous author of A Poetical Epistle from the Ghost of Dr. Johnson , mentioned earlier , who charged Courtenay with poor taste and with belaboring the obvious by proving that Johnson was “ not quite destitute of brains . "[ 18 ]</p>
    <p n="16">The greatest champion of the Review was , of course , Boswell . The Life is sprinkled with quotations from the third edition , 118 lines in all , mostly from Courtenay 's commendatory verses . In view of the many published attacks on Johnson , Boswell must have appreciated Courtenay 's sentiments all the more . Doubtless Courtenay 's warm praise of the Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides also found favor with Boswell .<span type="note_anchor">[ 19 ]</span>Perhaps Boswell 's final and least partial judgment of the Review was expressed in his letter to James Abercrombie of Philadelphia dated 11 June 1792 . He sent Abercrombie a copy of the poem , commenting that “ though I except to several passages , you will find some very good writing . "[ 20 ]</p>
    <p n="17">Courtenay 's Review , together with several other little known memorabilia concerning Johnson , stimulated one of the most energetic and splenetic literary controversies of the late eighteenth century . In addition , the Review and pieces like it aroused a considerable amount of useful , if vitriolic , discussion about the art of biography .</p>

Courtenay became alarmed over Boswell 's deepening melancholy , as seen in this passage from his letter to Malone of 22 February 1791 : “ Poor Boswell is very low , &amp; desperate &amp; ... melancholy mad , feels no spring , no pleasure in existence , &amp; is so perceptibly altered for the worse that it is remarked everywhere . I try all I can to revivify him , but he [ turns ? ] so tiresomely &amp; tediously — for the same cursed trite commonplace topics , about death &amp; c .— that we grow old , and when we are old , we are not young — that I despair of effecting a cure . Doctors Warren and Devaynes very kindly interest themselves about him , but you wd be of more service to him than anyone . ” Quoted from a MS at Yale University Library by James Osborn , “ Edmond Malone and Dr. Johnson , ” Johnson , Boswell and Their Circle : Essays Presented to Lawrence Fitzroy Powell in Honour of His Eighty-fourth Birthday ( Oxford , 1965 ) , p. 16 .</p>

In their own books intomb 'd their wisdom lies ; Too dull for talk , their slow conceptions rise : Yet the mute author , of his writings proud , For wit unshewn claims homage from the crowd ; As thread-bare misers , by mean avarice school 'd , Expect obeisance from their hidden gold .— In converse quick , impetuous Johnson press 'd His weighty logick , or sarcastick jest : Strong in the chace , and nimble in the turns ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>For victory still his fervid spirit burns ; Subtle when wrong , invincible when right , Arm 'd at all points , and glorying in his might , Gladiator-like , he traverses the field , And strength and skill compel the foe to yield .— Yet have I seen him , with a milder air , Encircled by the witty and the fair , Ev'n in old age with placid mien rejoice At beauty 's smile , and beauty 's flattering voice .— With Reynolds ’ pencil , vivid , bold , and true , So fervent Boswell gives him to our view . In every trait we see his mind expand ; The master rises by the pupil 's hand ; We love the writer , praise his happy vein , Grac 'd with the naiveté of the sage Montaigne .

Thus sings the Muse , to Johnson 's memory just , And scatters praise and censure o'er his dust ; For through each checker 'd scene a contrast ran , Too sad a proof , how great , how weak is man !

The sculptur 'd trophy , and imperial bust , That proudly rise around his hallow 'd dust , Shall mould'ring fall , by Time 's slow hand decay 'd , But the bright meed of virtue ne'er shall fade . Exulting Genius stamps his sacred name , Enroll 'd for ever in the dome of Fame .</docImprint>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 23 ]</span>“ He seemed to me to have an unaccountable prejudice against Swift .— He said to-day ,— I doubt if the Tale of a Tub was his ; it has so much more thinking , more knowledge , more power , more colour , than any of the works that are indisputably his . If it was his , I shall only say , he was impar sibi . ” Boswell 's Tour to the Hebrides , p. 38 .</p>
   <p>Doctor Johnson 's “ unaccountable prejudice against Swift ” may probably be derived from the same source as Blackmore 's , if we may venture to form a judgement from the panegyrick he bestows on the following groundless invective , expressly aimed at Swift as the author of A Tale of a Tub , which he quotes in his life of Blackmore : “ Several , in their books , have many sarcastical and spiteful strokes at religion in general ; while others make themselves pleasant with the principles of the Christian . Of the last kind , this age has seen a most audacious example , in the book intituled “ A Tale of a Tub . ” Had this writing been published in a pagan or popish nation , who are justly impatient of all indignity offered to the established religion of their country , no doubt but the author would have received the punishment he deserved .— But the fate of this impious buffoon is very different ; for in a protestant kingdom , zealous of their civil and religious immunities , he has not only escaped affronts and the effects of publick resentment , but has been caressed and patronised by persons of great figure of all denominations . ”</p>
   <p>The malevolent dullness of bigotry alone could have inspired Blackmore with these sentiments . The fact is , that the Tale of a Tub is a continued panegyrick on the Church of England , and a bitter satire on Popery , Calvinism , and every sect of dissenters . At the same time I am persuaded , that every reader of taste and discernment will perceive in many parts of Swift 's other writings strong internal proofs of that style which characterises the Tale of a Tub ; especially in the Publick Spirit of the Whigs . It is well known , that he affected simplicity , and studiously avoided any display of learning , except where the subject made it absolutely necessary . Temporary , local , and political topicks compose too great a part of his works ; but in a treatise that admitted “ more thinking , more knowledge , ” &amp; c. he naturally exerted all his powers .— Let us hear the author himself on this point .</p>
   <p>“ The greatest part of that book was finished above thirteen years since , ( 1696 ) which is eight years before it was published . The author was then young , his invention at the height , and his reading fresh in his head . ” And again : “ Men should be more cautious in losing their time , if they did but consider , that to answer a book effectually requireth more pains and skill , more wit , learning and judgement , than were employed in writing it .— And the author assureth those gentlemen , who have given themselves that trouble with him , that his discourse is the product of the study , the observation , and the invention of several years ; that he often blotted out more than he left ; and if his papers had not been a long time out of his possession , they must still have undergone more severe corrections . ” An Apology for the Tale of a Tub .— With respect to this work being the production of Swift , see his letter to the printer , Mr. Benjamin Tooke , dated Dublin , June 29 , 1710 , and Tooke 's Answer on the publication of the Apology and a new edition of the Tale of a Tub . Hawkesworth 's edition of Swift 's Works , 8vo . vol . xvi . p. 145 .</p>
   <p>Doctor Hawkesworth mentions , in his preface , that the edition of A Tale of a Tub , printed in 1710 , was revised and corrected by the Dean a short time before his understanding was impaired , and that the corrected copy was , in the year 1760 , in the hands of his kinsman , Mr. Deane Swift .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 26 ]</span>“ If ( added Dr. Johnson ) GOD had never spoken figuratively , we might hold that he speaks literally , when he says , “ This is my body . ” Boswell 's Tour , p . 67 .— Here his only objection to transubstantiation seems to rest on the style of the Scripture being figurative elsewhere as well as in this passage . Hence we may infer , that he would otherwise have believed in it .— But Archbishop Tillotson and Mr. Locke reason more philosophically , by asserting that “ no doctrine , however clearly expressed in Scripture , is to be admitted , if it contradict the evidence of our senses :— For our evidence for the truth of revealed religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses , because , even in the first authors of our religion , it was no greater ; and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to us , through the medium of human testimony . ” — This question , however , may perhaps be better elucidated by the following Anecdote , preserved by Mr. Richardson , than by a more serious discussion :</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Pope , who loved to talk of Titcum , ( one who used to be of the party with him , Gay , Swift , Craggs , and Addison , and that set , in his youth ,) told us , that Gay went to see him as he was dying , and asked him , if he would have a priest ; ( for he was a papist ,) ‘ No , said he , what should I do with them ? But I would rather have one of them , than one of yours , of the two . Our fools , ( continued he ) write great books to prove that bread is God ; but your booby ( he meant Tillotson ) has wrote a long argument to prove that bread is bread . ’ ” Richardsoniana , p. 167 .</p>

Neither doth there any thing properly conglaciate but water , or watery humidity , for the determination of quicksilver is properly fixation , that of milk coagulation , and that of oil and unctuous bodies only incrassation . ” — Is this written by Brown or Johnson ?</p>

The softness of my hands was secured by medicated gloves , and my bosom rubbed with a pomade prepared by my mother , of virtue to discuss pimples , and clear discolorations . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 50 ]</span>Dr. Johnson 's extraordinary facility of composition is well known from many circumstances . He wrote forty pages of the Life of Savage in one night . He composed seventy lines of his Imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal , and wrote them down from memory , without altering a word . In the Prologue on opening Drury-Lane theatre , he changed but one word , and that in compliment to Mr. Garrick . Some of his Ramblers were written while the printer 's messenger was waiting to carry the copy to the press . Many of the Idlers were written at Oxford ; Dr. Johnson often began his talk only just in time not to miss the post , and sent away the paper without reading it over .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 60 ]</span>The dignified and affecting letter written by him to the King in the name of Doctor Dodd , after his condemnation , is justly , and , I believe , universally admired . His benevolence , indeed , was uniform and unbounded .—— I have been assured , that he has often been so much affected by the sight of several unfortunate women , whom he has seen almost perishing in the streets , that he has taken them to his own house ; had them attended with care and tenderness ; and , on their recovery , clothed , and placed them in a way of life to earn their bread by honest industry .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 61 ]</span>The papers in the ADVENTURER , signed with the letter T , are commonly attributed to one of Dr. Johnson 's earliest and most intimate friends , Dr. Bathurst ; but there is good reason to believe that they were written by Dr. Johnson , and given by him to his friend . At that time Dr. Johnson was himself engaged in writing the Rambler , and could ill afford to make a present of his labours . The various other pieces that he gave away , have bestowed fame , and probably fortune , on several persons . To the great disgrace of some of his clerical friends , forty sermons , which he himself tells us he wrote , have not yet been deterré .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 62 ]</span>“ A good continued speech ( says Bacon in his ESSAYS ) without a good speech of interlocution , shews slowness ; and a good reply or second speech , without a good settled speech , sheweth shallowness and weakness . As we see in beasts , that those that are weakest in the course , are yet nimblest in the turn ; as it is betwixt the greyhound and the hare . ” — If this observation be just , Dr. Johnson is an exception to the rule ; for he was certainly as strong “ in the course , as nimble in the turn ” ; as ready in “ reply , ” as in “ a settled speech . ”</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 67 ]</span>“ The Hindu God , to whom the following poem is addressed , appears evidently the same with the Grecian EROS , and the Roman CUPIDO .—— His favourite place of resort is a large tract of country round AGRA , and principally the plains of Matra , where KRISHEN also and the nine GOPIA , who are clearly the Apollo and Muses of the Greeks , usually spend the night with musick and dance . ” Preface to the HYMN to CAMDEO , translated from the Hindu language into Persian , and re-translated by Sir William Jones .</p>
   <p>There can be little doubt , considering the antiquity and early civilisation of Hindostan , that both the philosophy and beautiful mythology of the Greeks were drawn from that part of Asia .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 68 ]</span>The following observation in Mr. Boswell 's Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides , may sufficiently account for that gentleman 's being “ now scarcely esteem 'd a Scot ” by many of his countrymen ; “ If he [ Dr. Johnson ] was particularly prejudiced against the Scots it was because they were more in his way ; because he thought their success in England rather exceeded the due proportion of their real merit ; and because he could not but see in them that nationality which , I believe , no liberal-minded Scotchman will deny . ” Mr. Boswell indeed is so free from national prejudices , that he might with equal propriety have been described as —</p>
   <p>“ Scarce by South Britons now esteem 'd a Scot . ”</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 69 ]</span>When Dr. Johnson repeated to Mr. Boswell Goldsmith 's beautiful eulogium on the English nation , his eyes filled with tears .— Boswell 's Tour , p . 431 .— See also the Dissertation on the Bravery of the English common Soldiers , at the end of the Idler .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 71 ]</span>Though Dr. Johnson has called Hamden the zealot of rebellion , yet that distinguished patriot could not have expressed himself with more ardour in the cause of liberty , than Dr. Johnson does in the following passage in his Life of Swift : “ In the succeeding reign [ that of George I . ] he delivered Ireland from plunder and oppression ; and shewed that wit , confederated with truth , had such force as authority was unable to resist .— It was from the time when he first began to patronize the Irish , that they may date their riches , and prosperity . He taught them first to know their own interest , their weight and their strength , and gave them spirit to assert that equality with their fellow-subjects to which they have been ever since making vigorous advances , and to claim those rights which they have at last established . ”</p>
   <p>The truth indeed seems to be , that Dr. Johnson , though he had been bred in high-church principles , and always expressed himself in controversial argument like a Tory , possessed a high independent spirit , and appears to have been a friend to the rights of man . His definition of the word Caitiff , in his Dictionary , may throw some light on this part of his character . “ Caitiff . [ cattivo , Ital . a slave ; whence it came to signify a bad man , with some implication of meanness ; as knave in English , and fur in Latin ; so certainly does slavery destroy virtue .</p>
   <p>Hêmisu tês aretês apoainutai doulion êmar .</p>
   <p>A slave and a scoundrel are signified by the same words in many languages . ] A mean villain , ” &amp; c. See also that animated passage in his London , beginning , “ Here let those reign , ” &amp; c .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 72 ]</span>It is observable that Dr. Johnson did not prefix a dedication to any one of his various works .</p>
