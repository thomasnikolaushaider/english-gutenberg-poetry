    <head>PREFACE .</head>
    <p n="1">Knowing within myself the manner in which this Poem has been produced , it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it public .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>What manner I mean , will be quite clear to the reader , who must soon perceive great inexperience , immaturity , and every error denoting a feverish attempt , rather than a deed accomplished . The two first books , and indeed the two last , I feel sensible are not of such completion as to warrant their passing the press ; nor should they if I thought a year 's castigation would do them any good ;— it will not : the foundations are too sandy . It is just that this youngster should die away : a sad thought for me , if I had not some hope that while it is dwindling I may be plotting , and fitting myself for verses fit to live . This may be speaking too presumptuously , and may deserve a punishment : but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it : he will leave me alone , with the conviction that there is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object . This is not written with the least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course , but from the desire I have to conciliate men who are competent to look , and who do look with a zealous eye , to the honour of English literature . The imagination of a boy is healthy , and the mature imagination of a man is healthy ; but there is a space of life between , in which the soul is in a ferment , the character undecided , the way of life uncertain , the ambition thick-sighted : thence proceeds mawkishness , and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of must necessarily taste in going over the following pages . I hope I have not in too late a day touched the beautiful mythology of Greece , and dulled its brightness : for I wish to try once more , before I bid it farewel .

    <head>BOOK I .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A thing of beauty is a joy for ever :</l>
     <l n="2">Its loveliness increases ; it will never</l>
     <l n="3">Pass into nothingness ; but still will keep</l>
     <l n="4">A bower quiet for us , and a sleep</l>
     <l n="5">Full of sweet dreams , and health , and quiet breathing .</l>
     <l n="6">Therefore , on every morrow , are we wreathing</l>
     <l n="7">A flowery band to bind us to the earth ,</l>
     <l n="8">Spite of despondence , of the inhuman dearth</l>
     <l n="9">Of noble natures , of the gloomy days ,</l>
     <l n="10">Of all the unhealthy and o'erhYpppHeNdarkened ways 10</l>
     <l n="11">Made for our searching : yes , in spite of all ,</l>
     <l n="12">Some shape of beauty moves away the pall</l>
     <l n="13">From our dark spirits . Such the sun , the moon ,</l>
     <l n="14">Trees old and young , sprouting a shady boon</l>
     <l n="15">For simple sheep ; and such are daffodils</l>
     <l n="16">With the green world they live in ; and clear rills</l>
     <l n="17">That for themselves a cooling covert make</l>
     <l n="18">‘ Gainst the hot season ; the mid forest brake ,</l>
     <l n="19">Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms :</l>
     <l n="20">And such too is the grandeur of the dooms 20</l>
     <l n="21">We have imagined for the mighty dead ;</l>
     <l n="22">All lovely tales that we have heard or read :</l>
     <l n="23">An endless fountain of immortal drink ,</l>
     <l n="24">Pouring unto us from the heaven 's brink .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="25">Nor do we merely feel these essences</l>
     <l n="26">For one short hour ; no , even as the trees</l>
     <l n="27">That whisper round a temple become soon</l>
     <l n="28">Dear as the temple 's self , so does the moon ,</l>
     <l n="29">The passion poesy , glories infinite ,</l>
     <l n="30">Haunt us till they become a cheering light 30</l>
     <l n="31">Unto our souls , and bound to us so fast ,</l>
     <l n="32">That , whether there be shine , or gloom o'ercast ,</l>
     <l n="33">They alway must be with us , or we die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="34">Therefore , ‘ tis with full happiness that I</l>
     <l n="35">Will trace the story of Endymion .</l>
     <l n="36">The very music of the name has gone</l>
     <l n="37">Into my being , and each pleasant scene</l>
     <l n="38">Is growing fresh before me as the green</l>
     <l n="39">Of our own vallies : so I will begin</l>
     <l n="40">Now while I cannot hear the city 's din ; 40</l>
     <l n="41">Now while the early budders are just new ,</l>
     <l n="42">And run in mazes of the youngest hue</l>
     <l n="43">About old forests ; while the willow trails</l>
     <l n="44">Its delicate amber ; and the dairy pails</l>
     <l n="45">Bring home increase of milk . And , as the year</l>
     <l n="46">Grows lush in juicy stalks , I 'll smoothly steer</l>
     <l n="47">My little boat , for many quiet hours ,</l>
     <l n="48">With streams that deepen freshly into bowers .</l>
     <l n="49">Many and many a verse I hope to write ,</l>
     <l n="50">Before the daisies , vermeil rimm 'd and white , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Hide in deep herbage ; and ere yet the bees</l>
     <l n="52">Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas ,</l>
     <l n="53">I must be near the middle of my story .</l>
     <l n="54">O may no wintry season , bare and hoary ,</l>
     <l n="55">See it half finished : but let Autumn bold ,</l>
     <l n="56">With universal tinge of sober gold ,</l>
     <l n="57">Be all about me when I make an end .</l>
     <l n="58">And now at once , adventuresome , I send</l>
     <l n="59">My herald thought into a wilderness :</l>
     <l n="60">There let its trumpet blow , and quickly dress 60</l>
     <l n="61">My uncertain path with green , that I may speed</l>
     <l n="62">Easily onward , thorough flowers and weed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="63">Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread</l>
     <l n="64">A mighty forest ; for the moist earth fed</l>
     <l n="65">So plenteously all weed-hidden roots</l>
     <l n="66">Into o'erhYpppHeNhanging boughs , and precious fruits .</l>
     <l n="67">And it had gloomy shades , sequestered deep ,</l>
     <l n="68">Where no man went ; and if from shepherd 's keep</l>
     <l n="69">A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens ,</l>
     <l n="70">Never again saw he the happy pens 70</l>
     <l n="71">Whither his brethren , bleating with content ,</l>
     <l n="72">Over the hills at every nightfall went .</l>
     <l n="73">Among the shepherds , ‘ twas believed ever ,</l>
     <l n="74">That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever</l>
     <l n="75">From the white flock , but pass 'd unworried</l>
     <l n="76">By angry wolf , or pard with prying head ,</l>
     <l n="77">Until it came to some unfooted plains</l>
     <l n="78">Where fed the herds of Pan : ay great his gains</l>
     <l n="79">Who thus one lamb did lose . Paths there were many ,</l>
     <l n="80">Winding through palmy fern , and rushes fenny , 80</l>
     <l n="81">And ivy banks ; all leading pleasantly</l>
     <l n="82">To a wide lawn , whence one could only see</l>
     <l n="83">Stems thronging all around between the swell</l>
     <l n="84">Of turf and slanting branches : who could tell</l>
     <l n="85">The freshness of the space of heaven above ,</l>
     <l n="86">Edg 'd round with dark tree tops ? through which a dove</l>
     <l n="87">Would often beat its wings , and often too</l>
     <l n="88">A little cloud would move across the blue .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="89">Full in the middle of this pleasantness</l>
     <l n="90">There stood a marble altar , with a tress 90</l>
     <l n="91">Of flowers budded newly ; and the dew</l>
     <l n="92">Had taken fairy phantasies to strew</l>
     <l n="93">Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve ,</l>
     <l n="94">And so the dawned light in pomp receive .</l>
     <l n="95">For ‘ twas the morn : Apollo 's upward fire</l>
     <l n="96">Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre</l>
     <l n="97">Of brightness so unsullied , that therein</l>
     <l n="98">A melancholy spirit well might win</l>
     <l n="99">Oblivion , and melt out his essence fine</l>
     <l n="100">Into the winds : rain-scented eglantine 100</l>
     <l n="101">Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun ;</l>
     <l n="102">The lark was lost in him ; cold springs had run</l>
     <l n="103">To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass ;</l>
     <l n="104">Man 's voice was on the mountains ; and the mass</l>
     <l n="105">Of nature 's lives and wonders puls 'd tenfold ,</l>
     <l n="106">To feel this sun-rise and its glories old .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="107">Now while the silent workings of the dawn</l>
     <l n="108">Were busiest , into that self-same lawn</l>
     <l n="109">All suddenly , with joyful cries , there sped</l>
     <l n="110">A troop of little children garlanded ; 110</l>
     <l n="111">Who gathering round the altar , seemed to pry</l>
     <l n="112">Earnestly round as wishing to espy</l>
     <l n="113">Some folk of holiday : nor had they waited</l>
     <l n="114">For many moments , ere their ears were sated</l>
     <l n="115">With a faint breath of music , which ev'n then</l>
     <l n="116">Fill 'd out its voice , and died away again .</l>
     <l n="117">Within a little space again it gave</l>
     <l n="118">Its airy swellings , with a gentle wave ,</l>
     <l n="119">To light-hung leaves , in smoothest echoes breaking</l>
     <l n="120">Through copse-clad vallies ,— ere their death , o'ertaking</l>
     <l n="121">The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea . 121</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="122">And now , as deep into the wood as we</l>
     <l n="123">Might mark a lynx 's eye , there glimmered light</l>
     <l n="124">Fair faces and a rush of garments white ,</l>
     <l n="125">Plainer and plainer shewing , till at last</l>
     <l n="126">Into the widest alley they all past ,</l>
     <l n="127">Making directly for the woodland altar .</l>
     <l n="128">O kindly muse ! let not my weak tongue faulter</l>
     <l n="129">In telling of this goodly company ,</l>
     <l n="130">Of their old piety , and of their glee : 130</l>
     <l n="131">But let a portion of ethereal dew</l>
     <l n="132">Fall on my head , and presently unmew</l>
     <l n="133">My soul ; that I may dare , in wayfaring ,</l>
     <l n="134">To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="135">Leading the way , young damsels danced along ,</l>
     <l n="136">Bearing the burden of a shepherd song ;</l>
     <l n="137">Each having a white wicker over brimm 'd</l>
     <l n="138">With April 's tender younglings : next , well trimm 'd ,</l>
     <l n="139">A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks</l>
     <l n="140">As may be read of in Arcadian books ; 140</l>
     <l n="141">Such as sat listening round Apollo 's pipe ,</l>
     <l n="142">When the great deity , for earth too ripe ,</l>
     <l n="143">Let his divinity o'erhYpppHeNflowing die</l>
     <l n="144">In music , through the vales of Thessaly :</l>
     <l n="145">Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground ,</l>
     <l n="146">And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound</l>
     <l n="147">With ebon-tipped flutes : close after these ,</l>
     <l n="148">Now coming from beneath the forest trees ,</l>
     <l n="149">A venerable priest full soberly ,</l>
     <l n="150">Begirt with ministring looks : alway his eye 150</l>
     <l n="151">Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept ,</l>
     <l n="152">And after him his sacred vestments swept .</l>
     <l n="153">From his right hand there swung a vase , milk-white ,</l>
     <l n="154">Of mingled wine , out-sparkling generous light ;</l>
     <l n="155">And in his left he held a basket full</l>
     <l n="156">Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull :</l>
     <l n="157">Wild thyme , and valley-lilies whiter still</l>
     <l n="158">Than Leda 's love , and cresses from the rill .</l>
     <l n="159">His aged head , crowned with beechen wreath ,</l>
     <l n="160">Seem 'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth 160</l>
     <l n="161">Of winter hoar . Then came another crowd</l>
     <l n="162">Of shepherds , lifting in due time aloud</l>
     <l n="163">Their share of the ditty . After them appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="164">Up-followed by a multitude that rear 'd</l>
     <l n="165">Their voices to the clouds , a fair wrought car ,</l>
     <l n="166">Easily rolling so as scarce to mar</l>
     <l n="167">The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown :</l>
     <l n="168">Who stood therein did seem of great renown</l>
     <l n="169">Among the throng . His youth was fully blown ,</l>
     <l n="170">Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown ; 170</l>
     <l n="171">And , for those simple times , his garments were</l>
     <l n="172">A chieftain king 's : beneath his breast , half bare ,</l>
     <l n="173">Was hung a silver bugle , and between</l>
     <l n="174">His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen .</l>
     <l n="175">A smile was on his countenance ; he seem 'd ,</l>
     <l n="176">To common lookers on , like one who dream 'd</l>
     <l n="177">Of idleness in groves Elysian :</l>
     <l n="178">But there were some who feelingly could scan</l>
     <l n="179">A lurking trouble in his nether lip ,</l>
     <l n="180">And see that oftentimes the reins would slip 180</l>
     <l n="181">Through his forgotten hands : then would they sigh ,</l>
     <l n="182">And think of yellow leaves , of owlets cry ,</l>
     <l n="183">Of logs piled solemnly .— Ah , well-a-day ,</l>
     <l n="184">Why should our young Endymion pine away !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="185">Soon the assembly , in a circle rang 'd ,</l>
     <l n="186">Stood silent round the shrine : each look was chang 'd</l>
     <l n="187">To sudden veneration : women meek</l>
     <l n="188">Beckon 'd their sons to silence ; while each cheek</l>
     <l n="189">Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear .</l>
     <l n="190">Endymion too , without a forest peer , 190</l>
     <l n="191">Stood , wan , and pale , and with an awed face ,</l>
     <l n="192">Among his brothers of the mountain chase .</l>
     <l n="193">In midst of all , the venerable priest</l>
     <l n="194">Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least ,</l>
     <l n="195">And , after lifting up his aged hands ,</l>
     <l n="196">Thus spake he : “ Men of Latmos ! shepherd bands !</l>
     <l n="197">Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks :</l>
     <l n="198">Whether descended from beneath the rocks</l>
     <l n="199">That overtop your mountains ; whether come</l>
     <l n="200">From vallies where the pipe is never dumb ; 200</l>
     <l n="201">Or from your swelling downs , where sweet air stirs</l>
     <l n="202">Blue hare-bells lightly , and where prickly furze</l>
     <l n="203">Buds lavish gold ; or ye , whose precious charge</l>
     <l n="204">Nibble their fill at ocean 's very marge ,</l>
     <l n="205">Whose mellow reeds are touch 'd with sounds forlorn</l>
     <l n="206">By the dim echoes of old Triton 's horn :</l>
     <l n="207">Mothers and wives ! who day by day prepare</l>
     <l n="208">The scrip , with needments , for the mountain air ;</l>
     <l n="209">And all ye gentle girls who foster up</l>
     <l n="210">Udderless lambs , and in a little cup 210</l>
     <l n="211">Will put choice honey for a favoured youth :</l>
     <l n="212">Yea , every one attend ! for in good truth</l>
     <l n="213">Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan .</l>
     <l n="214">Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than</l>
     <l n="215">Night-swollen mushrooms ? Are not our wide plains</l>
     <l n="216">Speckled with countless fleeces ? Have not rains</l>
     <l n="217">Green 'd over April 's lap ? No howling sad</l>
     <l n="218">Sickens our fearful ewes ; and we have had</l>
     <l n="219">Great bounty from Endymion our lord .</l>
     <l n="220">The earth is glad : the merry lark has pour 'd 220</l>
     <l n="221">His early song against yon breezy sky ,</l>
     <l n="222">That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="223">Thus ending , on the shrine he heap 'd a spire</l>
     <l n="224">Of teeming sweets , enkindling sacred fire ;</l>
     <l n="225">Anon he stain 'd the thick and spongy sod</l>
     <l n="226">With wine , in honour of the shepherd-god .</l>

     <l n="917">Sluggishly by , ere more contentment swept</l>
     <l n="918">Away at once the deadly yellow spleen .</l>
     <l n="919">Yes , thrice have I this fair enchantment seen ;</l>
     <l n="920">Once more been tortured with renewed life . 920</l>
     <l n="921">When last the wintry gusts gave over strife</l>
     <l n="922">With the conquering sun of spring , and left the skies</l>
     <l n="923">Warm and serene , but yet with moistened eyes</l>
     <l n="924">In pity of the shatter 'd infant buds ,—</l>
     <l n="925">That time thou didst adorn , with amber studs ,</l>
     <l n="926">My hunting cap , because I laugh 'd and smil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="927">Chatted with thee , and many days exil 'd</l>
     <l n="928">All torment from my breast ;— ‘ twas even then ,</l>
     <l n="929">Straying about , yet , coop 'd up in the den</l>
     <l n="930">Of helpless discontent ,— hurling my lance 930</l>
     <l n="931">From place to place , and following at chance ,</l>
     <l n="932">At last , by hap , through some young trees it struck ,</l>
     <l n="933">And , plashing among bedded pebbles , stuck</l>
     <l n="934">In the middle of a brook ,— whose silver ramble</l>
     <l n="935">Down twenty little falls , through reeds and bramble ,</l>
     <l n="936">Tracing along , it brought me to a cave ,</l>
     <l n="937">Whence it ran brightly forth , and white did lave</l>
     <l n="938">The nether sides of mossy stones and rock ,—</l>
     <l n="939">‘ Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus , to mock</l>
     <l n="940">Its own sweet grief at parting . Overhead , 940</l>
     <l n="941">Hung a lush scene of drooping weeds , and spread</l>
     <l n="942">Thick , as to curtain up some wood-nymph 's home .</l>
     <l n="943">“ Ah ! impious mortal , whither do I roam ? ”</l>

     <l n="947">She dabbles , on the cool and sluicy sands :</l>
     <l n="948">Or ‘ tis the cell of Echo , where she sits ,</l>

     <l n="952">Of sadness . O that she would take my vows ,</l>

     <l n="954">To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head ,</l>
     <l n="955">Daily , I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed ,</l>
     <l n="956">And weave them dyingly — send honey-whispers</l>
     <l n="957">Round every leaf , that all those gentle lispers</l>
     <l n="958">May sigh my love unto her pitying !</l>
     <l n="959">O charitable echo ! hear , and sing</l>
     <l n="960">This ditty to her !— tell her ” — so I stay 'd 960</l>
     <l n="961">My foolish tongue , and listening , half afraid ,</l>
     <l n="962">Stood stupefied with my own empty folly ,</l>
     <l n="963">And blushing for the freaks of melancholy .</l>
     <l n="964">Salt tears were coming , when I heard my name</l>
     <l n="965">Most fondly lipp 'd , and then these accents came :</l>
     <l n="966">“ Endymion ! the cave is secreter</l>
     <l n="967">Than the isle of Delos . Echo hence shall stir</l>
     <l n="968">No sighs but sigh-warm kisses , or light noise</l>
     <l n="969">Of thy combing hand , the while it travelling cloys</l>
     <l n="970">And trembles through my labyrinthine hair . ” 970</l>
     <l n="971">At that oppress 'd I hurried in .— Ah ! where</l>

     <l n="977">To occupy me wholly , and to fashion</l>
     <l n="978">My pilgrimage for the world 's dusky brink .</l>
     <l n="979">No more will I count over , link by link ,</l>
     <l n="980">My chain of grief : no longer strive to find 980</l>
     <l n="981">A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind</l>

     <l n="986">Where'er I look : but yet , I 'll say ‘ tis naught —</l>
     <l n="987">And here I bid it die . Have not I caught ,</l>

     <l n="3">And shadowy , through the mist of passed years :</l>
     <l n="4">For others , good or bad , hatred and tears</l>
     <l n="5">Have become indolent ; but touching thine ,</l>
     <l n="6">One sigh doth echo , one poor sob doth pine ,</l>
     <l n="7">One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days .</l>
     <l n="8">The woes of Troy , towers smothering o'er their blaze ,</l>
     <l n="9">Stiff-holden shields , far-piercing spears , keen blades ,</l>
     <l n="10">Struggling , and blood , and shrieks — all dimly fades 10</l>
     <l n="11">Into some backward corner of the brain ;</l>

     <l n="15">Swart planet in the universe of deeds !</l>
     <l n="16">Wide sea , that one continuous murmur breeds</l>
     <l n="17">Along the pebbled shore of memory !</l>
     <l n="18">Many old rotten-timber 'd boats there be</l>
     <l n="19">Upon thy vaporous bosom , magnified</l>
     <l n="20">To goodly vessels ; many a sail of pride , 20</l>
     <l n="21">And golden keel 'd , is left unlaunch 'd and dry .</l>
     <l n="22">But wherefore this ? What care , though owl did fly</l>

     <l n="24">What care , though striding Alexander past</l>
     <l n="25">The Indus with his Macedonian numbers ?</l>
     <l n="26">Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers</l>

     <l n="29">Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow ,</l>
     <l n="30">Doth more avail than these : the silver flow 30</l>

     <l n="47">Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows ?</l>
     <l n="48">Alas ! ‘ tis his old grief . For many days ,</l>
     <l n="49">Has he been wandering in uncertain ways :</l>
     <l n="50">Through wilderness , and woods of mossed oaks ; 50</l>
     <l n="51">Counting his woe-worn minutes , by the strokes</l>
     <l n="52">Of the lone woodcutter ; and listening still ,</l>
     <l n="53">Hour after hour , to each lush-leav 'd rill .</l>
     <l n="54">Now he is sitting by a shady spring ,</l>
     <l n="55">And elbow-deep with feverous fingering</l>
     <l n="56">Stems the upbursting cold : a wild rose tree</l>
     <l n="57">Pavilions him in bloom , and he doth see</l>
     <l n="58">A bud which snares his fancy : lo ! but now</l>
     <l n="59">He plucks it , dips its stalk in the water : how !</l>
     <l n="60">It swells , it buds , it flowers beneath his sight ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">And , in the middle , there is softly pight</l>
     <l n="62">A golden butterfly ; upon whose wings</l>
     <l n="63">There must be surely character 'd strange things ,</l>
     <l n="64">For with wide eye he wonders , and smiles oft .</l>

     <l n="65">Lightly this little herald flew aloft ,</l>
     <l n="66">Follow 'd by glad Endymion 's clasped hands :</l>
     <l n="67">Onward it flies . From languor 's sullen bands</l>
     <l n="68">His limbs are loos 'd , and eager , on he hies</l>
     <l n="69">Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies .</l>
     <l n="70">It seem 'd he flew , the way so easy was ; 70</l>
     <l n="71">And like a new-born spirit did he pass</l>
     <l n="72">Through the green evening quiet in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="73">O'er many a heath , through many a woodland dun ,</l>
     <l n="74">Through buried paths , where sleepy twilight dreams</l>
     <l n="75">The summer time away . One track unseams</l>
     <l n="76">A wooded cleft , and , far away , the blue</l>
     <l n="77">Of ocean fades upon him ; then , anew ,</l>
     <l n="78">He sinks adown a solitary glen ,</l>
     <l n="79">Where there was never sound of mortal men ,</l>
     <l n="80">Saving , perhaps , some snow-light cadences 80</l>
     <l n="81">Melting to silence , when upon the breeze</l>
     <l n="82">Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet ,</l>
     <l n="83">To cheer itself to Delphi . Still his feet</l>
     <l n="84">Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide ,</l>
     <l n="85">Until it reached a splashing fountain 's side</l>
     <l n="86">That , near a cavern 's mouth , for ever pour 'd</l>
     <l n="87">Unto the temperate air : then high it soar 'd ,</l>
     <l n="88">And , downward , suddenly began to dip ,</l>
     <l n="89">As if , athirst with so much toil , ‘ twould sip</l>
     <l n="90">The crystal spout-head : so it did , with touch 90</l>
     <l n="91">Most delicate , as though afraid to smutch</l>
     <l n="92">Even with mealy gold the waters clear .</l>
     <l n="93">But , at that very touch , to disappear</l>
     <l n="94">So fairy-quick , was strange ! Bewildered ,</l>
     <l n="95">Endymion sought around , and shook each bed</l>
     <l n="96">Of covert flowers in vain ; and then he flung</l>
     <l n="97">Himself along the grass . What gentle tongue ,</l>
     <l n="98">What whisperer disturb 'd his gloomy rest ?</l>
     <l n="99">It was a nymph uprisen to the breast</l>
     <l n="100">In the fountain 's pebbly margin , and she stood 100</l>
     <l n="101">‘ Mong lilies , like the youngest of the brood .</l>
     <l n="102">To him her dripping hand she softly kist ,</l>
     <l n="103">And anxiously began to plait and twist</l>
     <l n="104">Her ringlets round her fingers , saying : “ Youth !</l>
     <l n="105">Too long , alas , hast thou starv 'd on the ruth ,</l>

     <l n="397">And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach ,</l>
     <l n="398">Or ripe October 's faded marigolds ,</l>
     <l n="399">Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds —</l>
     <l n="400">Not hiding up an Apollonian curve 400</l>
     <l n="401">Of neck and shoulder , nor the tenting swerve</l>
     <l n="402">Of knee from knee , nor ankles pointing light ;</l>

     <l n="404">Officiously . Sideway his face repos 'd</l>
     <l n="405">On one white arm , and tenderly unclos 'd ,</l>
     <l n="406">By tenderest pressure , a faint damask mouth</l>
     <l n="407">To slumbery pout ; just as the morning south</l>
     <l n="408">Disparts a dew-lipp 'd rose . Above his head ,</l>
     <l n="409">Four lily stalks did their white honours wed</l>
     <l n="410">To make a coronal ; and round him grew 410</l>
     <l n="411">All tendrils green , of every bloom and hue ,</l>
     <l n="412">Together intertwin 'd and trammel 'd fresh :</l>
     <l n="413">The vine of glossy sprout ; the ivy mesh ,</l>
     <l n="414">Shading its Ethiop berries ; and woodbine ,</l>
     <l n="415">Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine ;</l>
     <l n="416">Convolvulus in streaked vases flush ;</l>
     <l n="417">The creeper , mellowing for an autumn blush ;</l>
     <l n="418">And virgin 's bower , trailing airily ;</l>
     <l n="419">With others of the sisterhood . Hard by ,</l>
     <l n="420">Stood serene Cupids watching silently . 420</l>
     <l n="421">One , kneeling to a lyre , touch 'd the strings ,</l>
     <l n="422">Muffling to death the pathos with his wings ;</l>
     <l n="423">And , ever and anon , uprose to look</l>
     <l n="424">At the youth 's slumber ; while another took</l>
     <l n="425">A willow-bough , distilling odorous dew ,</l>
     <l n="426">And shook it on his hair ; another flew</l>
     <l n="427">In through the woven roof , and fluttering-wise</l>

     <l n="431">Until , impatient in embarrassment ,</l>
     <l n="432">He forthright pass 'd , and lightly treading went</l>
     <l n="433">To that same feather 'd lyrist , who straightway ,</l>
     <l n="434">Smiling , thus whisper 'd : “ Though from upper day</l>

     <l n="448">Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam ;</l>
     <l n="449">Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm 'd</l>
     <l n="450">For the boy Jupiter : and here , undimm 'd 450</l>
     <l n="451">By any touch , a bunch of blooming plums</l>
     <l n="452">Ready to melt between an infant 's gums :</l>

     <l n="454">In starlight , by the three Hesperides .</l>
     <l n="455">Feast on , and meanwhile I will let thee know</l>
     <l n="456">Of all these things around us . ” He did so ,</l>
     <l n="457">Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre ;</l>
     <l n="458">And thus : “ I need not any hearing tire</l>
     <l n="459">By telling how the sea-born goddess pin 'd</l>

     <l n="466">Content , O fool ! to make a cold retreat ,</l>
     <l n="467">When on the pleasant grass such love , lovelorn ,</l>

     <l n="469">Of diverse passion ; when her lips and eyes</l>
     <l n="470">Were clos 'd in sullen moisture , and quick sighs 470</l>
     <l n="471">Came vex 'd and pettish through her nostrils small .</l>
     <l n="472">Hush ! no exclaim — yet , justly mightst thou call</l>
     <l n="473">Curses upon his head .— I was half glad ,</l>
     <l n="474">But my poor mistress went distract and mad ,</l>
     <l n="475">When the boar tusk 'd him : so away she flew</l>
     <l n="476">To Jove 's high throne , and by her plainings drew</l>
     <l n="477">Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer 's beard ;</l>

     <l n="486">The which she fills with visions , and doth dress</l>
     <l n="487">In all this quiet luxury ; and hath set</l>

     <l n="490">Even to a moment 's filling up , and fast 490</l>
     <l n="491">She scuds with summer breezes , to pant through</l>
     <l n="492">The first long kiss , warm firstling , to renew</l>
     <l n="493">Embower 'd sports in Cytherea 's isle .</l>
     <l n="494">Look ! how those winged listeners all this while</l>

     <l n="496">Broke through the careful silence ; for they heard</l>
     <l n="497">A rustling noise of leaves , and out there flutter 'd</l>
     <l n="498">Pigeons and doves : Adonis something mutter 'd ,</l>
     <l n="499">The while one hand , that erst upon his thigh</l>
     <l n="500">Lay dormant , mov 'd convuls 'd and gradually 500</l>
     <l n="501">Up to his forehead . Then there was a hum</l>
     <l n="502">Of sudden voices , echoing , “ Come ! come !</l>
     <l n="503">Arise ! awake ! Clear summer has forth walk 'd</l>
     <l n="504">Unto the clover-sward , and she has talk 'd</l>
     <l n="505">Full soothingly to every nested finch :</l>

     <l n="507">To your dimpled arms . Once more sweet life begin ! ”</l>
     <l n="508">At this , from every side they hurried in ,</l>
     <l n="509">Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists ,</l>
     <l n="510">And doubling over head their little fists 510</l>
     <l n="511">In backward yawns . But all were soon alive :</l>
     <l n="512">For as delicious wine doth , sparkling , dive</l>
     <l n="513">In nectar 'd clouds and curls through water fair ,</l>
     <l n="514">So from the arbour roof down swell 'd an air</l>
     <l n="515">Odorous and enlivening ; making all</l>
     <l n="516">To laugh , and play , and sing , and loudly call</l>
     <l n="517">For their sweet queen : when lo ! the wreathed green</l>
     <l n="518">Disparted , and far upward could be seen</l>
     <l n="519">Blue heaven , and a silver car , air-borne ,</l>
     <l n="520">Whose silent wheels , fresh wet from clouds of morn ,</l>
     <l n="521">Spun off a drizzling dew ,— which falling chill 521</l>
     <l n="522">On soft Adonis ’ shoulders , made him still</l>
     <l n="523">Nestle and turn uneasily about .</l>
     <l n="524">Soon were the white doves plain , with necks stretch 'd out ,</l>
     <l n="525">And silken traces lighten 'd in descent ;</l>
     <l n="526">And soon , returning from love 's banishment ,</l>
     <l n="527">Queen Venus leaning downward open arm 'd :</l>
     <l n="528">Her shadow fell upon his breast , and charm 'd</l>
     <l n="529">A tumult to his heart , and a new life</l>
     <l n="530">Into his eyes . Ah , miserable strife , 530</l>
     <l n="531">But for her comforting ! unhappy sight ,</l>
     <l n="532">But meeting her blue orbs ! Who , who can write</l>
     <l n="533">Of these first minutes ? The unchariest muse</l>
     <l n="534">To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="535">O it has ruffled every spirit there ,</l>
     <l n="536">Saving love 's self , who stands superb to share</l>
     <l n="537">The general gladness : awfully he stands ;</l>
     <l n="538">A sovereign quell is in his waving hands ;</l>
     <l n="539">No sight can bear the lightning of his bow ;</l>
     <l n="540">His quiver is mysterious , none can know 540</l>
     <l n="541">What themselves think of it ; from forth his eyes</l>
     <l n="542">There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes :</l>
     <l n="543">A scowl is sometimes on his brow , but who</l>
     <l n="544">Look full upon it feel anon the blue</l>
     <l n="545">Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls .</l>
     <l n="546">Endymion feels it , and no more controls</l>
     <l n="547">The burning prayer within him ; so , bent low ,</l>
     <l n="548">He had begun a plaining of his woe .</l>
     <l n="549">But Venus , bending forward , said : “ My child ,</l>
     <l n="550">Favour this gentle youth ; his days are wild 550</l>
     <l n="551">With love — he — but alas ! too well I see</l>
     <l n="552">Thou know'st the deepness of his misery .</l>
     <l n="553">Ah , smile not so , my son : I tell thee true ,</l>
     <l n="554">That when through heavy hours I used to rue</l>
     <l n="555">The endless sleep of this new-born Adon ’ ,</l>
     <l n="556">This stranger ay I pitied . For upon</l>
     <l n="557">A dreary morning once I fled away</l>
     <l n="558">Into the breezy clouds , to weep and pray</l>
     <l n="559">For this my love : for vexing Mars had teaz 'd</l>
     <l n="560">Me even to tears : thence , when a little eas 'd , 560</l>
     <l n="561">Down-looking , vacant , through a hazy wood ,</l>
     <l n="562">I saw this youth as he despairing stood :</l>
     <l n="563">Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind ;</l>
     <l n="564">Those same full fringed lids a constant blind</l>
     <l n="565">Over his sullen eyes : I saw him throw</l>
     <l n="566">Himself on wither 'd leaves , even as though</l>
     <l n="567">Death had come sudden ; for no jot he mov 'd ,</l>
     <l n="568">Yet mutter 'd wildly . I could hear he lov 'd</l>
     <l n="569">Some fair immortal , and that his embrace</l>
     <l n="570">Had zoned her through the night . There is no trace 570</l>
     <l n="571">Of this in heaven : I have mark 'd each cheek ,</l>
     <l n="572">And find it is the vainest thing to seek ;</l>
     <l n="573">And that of all things ‘ tis kept secretest .</l>
     <l n="574">Endymion ! one day thou wilt be blest :</l>
     <l n="575">So still obey the guiding hand that fends</l>
     <l n="576">Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends .</l>
     <l n="577">‘ Tis a concealment needful in extreme ;</l>
     <l n="578">And if I guess 'd not so , the sunny beam</l>
     <l n="579">Thou shouldst mount up to with me . Now adieu !</l>
     <l n="580">Here must we leave thee . ” — At these words up flew 580</l>
     <l n="581">The impatient doves , up rose the floating car ,</l>
     <l n="582">Up went the hum celestial . High afar</l>
     <l n="583">The Latmian saw them minish into nought ;</l>
     <l n="584">And , when all were clear vanish 'd , still he caught</l>
     <l n="585">A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow .</l>
     <l n="586">When all was darkened , with Etnean throe</l>
     <l n="587">The earth clos 'd — gave a solitary moan —</l>

     <l n="594">So , with unusual gladness , on he hies</l>

     <l n="596">Gold dome , and crystal wall , and turquois floor ,</l>
     <l n="597">Black polish 'd porticos of awful shade ,</l>

     <l n="607">Done heedlessly , those spouting columns rose</l>
     <l n="608">Sudden a poplar 's height , and ‘ gan to enclose</l>
     <l n="609">His diamond path with fretwork , streaming round</l>
     <l n="610">Alive , and dazzling cool , and with a sound , 610</l>
     <l n="611">Haply , like dolphin tumults , when sweet shells</l>
     <l n="612">Welcome the float of Thetis . Long he dwells</l>

     <l n="1">There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men</l>
     <l n="2">With most prevailing tinsel : who unpen</l>
     <l n="3">Their baaing vanities , to browse away</l>
     <l n="4">The comfortable green and juicy hay</l>
     <l n="5">From human pastures ; or , O torturing fact !</l>
     <l n="6">Who , through an idiot blink , will see unpack 'd</l>
     <l n="7">Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe</l>
     <l n="8">Our gold and ripe-ear 'd hopes . With not one tinge</l>
     <l n="9">Of sanctuary splendour , not a sight</l>
     <l n="10">Able to face an owl 's , they still are dight 10</l>
     <l n="11">By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests ,</l>
     <l n="12">And crowns , and turbans . With unladen breasts ,</l>
     <l n="13">Save of blown self-applause , they proudly mount</l>
     <l n="14">To their spirit 's perch , their being 's high account ,</l>
     <l n="15">Their tiptop nothings , their dull skies , their thrones —</l>
     <l n="16">Amid the fierce intoxicating tones</l>
     <l n="17">Of trumpets , shoutings , and belabour 'd drums ,</l>
     <l n="18">And sudden cannon . All ! how all this hums ,</l>
     <l n="19">In wakeful ears , like uproar past and gone —</l>
     <l n="20">Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon , 20</l>
     <l n="21">And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks .—</l>
     <l n="22">Are then regalities all gilded masks ?</l>
     <l n="23">No , there are throned seats unscalable</l>
     <l n="24">But by a patient wing , a constant spell ,</l>
     <l n="25">Or by ethereal things that , unconfin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="26">Can make a ladder of the eternal wind ,</l>
     <l n="27">And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents</l>
     <l n="28">To watch the abysm-birth of elements .</l>
     <l n="29">Aye , ‘ bove the withering of old-lipp 'd Fate</l>
     <l n="30">A thousand Powers keep religious state , 30</l>
     <l n="31">In water , fiery realm , and airy bourne ;</l>
     <l n="32">And , silent as a consecrated urn ,</l>
     <l n="33">Hold sphery sessions for a season due .</l>
     <l n="34">Yet few of these far majesties , ah , few !</l>
     <l n="35">Have bared their operations to this globe —</l>
     <l n="36">Few , who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe</l>
     <l n="37">Our piece of heaven — whose benevolence</l>
     <l n="38">Shakes hand with our own Ceres ; every sense</l>
     <l n="39">Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude ,</l>
     <l n="40">As bees gorge full their cells . And , by the feud 40</l>
     <l n="41">‘ Twixt Nothing and Creation , I here swear ,</l>

     <l n="44">When thy gold breath is misting in the west ,</l>
     <l n="45">She unobserved steals unto her throne ,</l>
     <l n="46">And there she sits most meek and most alone ;</l>
     <l n="47">As if she had not pomp subservient ;</l>
     <l n="48">As if thine eye , high Poet ! was not bent</l>
     <l n="49">Towards her with the Muses in thine heart ;</l>
     <l n="50">As if the ministring stars kept not apart , 50</l>
     <l n="51">Waiting for silver-footed messages .</l>
     <l n="52">O Moon ! the oldest shades ‘ mong oldest trees</l>
     <l n="53">Feel palpitations when thou lookest in :</l>
     <l n="54">O Moon ! old boughs lisp forth a holier din</l>
     <l n="55">The while they feel thine airy fellowship .</l>

     <l n="57">Kissing dead things to life . The sleeping kine ,</l>
     <l n="58">Couched in thy brightness , dream of fields divine :</l>
     <l n="59">Innumerable mountains rise , and rise ,</l>
     <l n="60">Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes ; 60</l>
     <l n="61">And yet thy benediction passeth not</l>
     <l n="62">One obscure hiding-place , one little spot</l>
     <l n="63">Where pleasure may be sent : the nested wren</l>
     <l n="64">Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken ,</l>
     <l n="65">And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf</l>
     <l n="66">Takes glimpses of thee ; thou art a relief</l>
     <l n="67">To the poor patient oyster , where it sleeps</l>
     <l n="68">Within its pearly house .— The mighty deeps ,</l>
     <l n="69">The monstrous sea is thine — the myriad sea !</l>
     <l n="70">O Moon ! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee , 70</l>

     <l n="901">To Lucifer or Baal , when he 'd pine</l>
     <l n="902">After a little sleep : or when in mine</l>
     <l n="903">Far under-ground , a sleeper meets his friends</l>
     <l n="904">Who know him not . Each diligently bends</l>
     <l n="905">Towards common thoughts and things for very fear ;</l>
     <l n="906">Striving their ghastly malady to cheer ,</l>
     <l n="907">By thinking it a thing of yes and no ,</l>
     <l n="908">That housewives talk of . But the spirit-blow</l>
     <l n="909">Was struck , and all were dreamers . At the last</l>
     <l n="910">Endymion said : “ Are not our fates all cast ? 910</l>
     <l n="911">Why stand we here ? Adieu , ye tender pair !</l>
     <l n="912">Adieu ! ” Whereat those maidens , with wild stare ,</l>
     <l n="913">Walk 'd dizzily away . Pained and hot</l>
     <l n="914">His eyes went after them , until they got</l>
     <l n="915">Near to a cypress grove , whose deadly maw ,</l>
     <l n="916">In one swift moment , would what then he saw</l>
     <l n="917">Engulph for ever . “ Stay ! ” he cried , “ ah , stay !</l>
     <l n="918">Turn , damsels ! hist ! one word I have to say .</l>
     <l n="919">Sweet Indian , I would see thee once again .</l>
     <l n="920">It is a thing I dote on : so I 'd fain , 920</l>
     <l n="921">Peona , ye should hand in hand repair</l>
     <l n="922">Into those holy groves , that silent are</l>
     <l n="923">Behind great Dian 's temple . I 'll be yon ,</l>
     <l n="924">At vesper 's earliest twinkle — they are gone —</l>
     <l n="925">But once , once , once again — ” At this he press 'd</l>
     <l n="926">His hands against his face , and then did rest</l>
     <l n="927">His head upon a mossy hillock green ,</l>
     <l n="928">And so remain 'd as he a corpse had been</l>
     <l n="929">All the long day ; save when he scantly lifted</l>
     <l n="930">His eyes abroad , to see how shadows shifted 930</l>
     <l n="931">With the slow move of time ,— sluggish and weary</l>
     <l n="932">Until the poplar tops , in journey dreary ,</l>
     <l n="933">Had reach 'd the river 's brim . Then up he rose ,</l>
     <l n="934">And , slowly as that very river flows ,</l>
     <l n="935">Walk 'd towards the temple grove with this lament :</l>
     <l n="936">“ Why such a golden eve ? The breeze is sent</l>
     <l n="937">Careful and soft , that not a leaf may fall</l>
     <l n="938">Before the serene father of them all</l>
     <l n="939">Bows down his summer head below the west .</l>
     <l n="940">Now am I of breath , speech , and speed possest , 940</l>
     <l n="941">But at the setting I must bid adieu</l>
     <l n="942">To her for the last time . Night will strew</l>
     <l n="943">On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves ,</l>
     <l n="944">And with them shall I die ; nor much it grieves</l>
     <l n="945">To die , when summer dies on the cold sward .</l>
     <l n="946">Why , I have been a butterfly , a lord</l>
     <l n="947">Of flowers , garlands , love-knots , silly posies ,</l>
     <l n="948">Groves , meadows , melodies , and arbour roses ;</l>
     <l n="949">My kingdom 's at its death , and just it is</l>
     <l n="950">That I should die with it : so in all this 950</l>
     <l n="951">We miscal grief , bale , sorrow , heartbreak , woe ,</l>
     <l n="952">What is there to plain of ? By Titan 's foe</l>
     <l n="953">I am but rightly serv 'd . ” So saying , he</l>
     <l n="954">Tripp 'd lightly on , in sort of deathful glee ;</l>
     <l n="955">Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun ,</l>
     <l n="956">As though they jests had been : nor had he done</l>
     <l n="957">His laugh at nature 's holy countenance ,</l>
     <l n="958">Until that grove appear 'd , as if perchance ,</l>
     <l n="959">And then his tongue with sober seemlihed</l>
     <l n="960">Gave utterance as he entered : “ Ha ! ” I said , 960</l>
     <l n="961">“ King of the butterflies ; but by this gloom ,</l>
     <l n="962">And by old Rhadamanthus ’ tongue of doom ,</l>
     <l n="963">This dusk religion , pomp of solitude ,</l>
     <l n="964">And the Promethean clay by thief endued ,</l>
     <l n="965">By old Saturnus ’ forelock , by his head</l>
     <l n="966">Shook with eternal palsy , I did wed</l>
     <l n="967">Myself to things of light from infancy ;</l>
     <l n="968">And thus to be cast out , thus lorn to die ,</l>
     <l n="969">Is sure enough to make a mortal man</l>
     <l n="970">Grow impious . ” So he inwardly began 970</l>
     <l n="971">On things for which no wording can be found ;</l>
     <l n="972">Deeper and deeper sinking , until drown 'd</l>
     <l n="973">Beyond the reach of music : for the choir</l>
     <l n="974">Of Cynthia he heard not , though rough briar</l>
     <l n="975">Nor muffling thicket interpos 'd to dull</l>
     <l n="976">The vesper hymn , far swollen , soft and full ,</l>
     <l n="977">Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles .</l>
     <l n="978">He saw not the two maidens , nor their smiles ,</l>
     <l n="979">Wan as primroses gather 'd at midnight</l>
     <l n="980">By chilly finger 'd spring . “ Unhappy wight ! 980</l>
     <l n="981">Endymion ! ” said Peona , “ we are here !</l>
     <l n="982">What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier ? ”</l>
     <l n="983">Then he embrac 'd her , and his lady 's hand</l>
     <l n="984">Press 'd , saying : “ Sister , I would have command ,</l>
     <l n="985">If it were heaven 's will , on our sad fate . ”</l>
     <l n="986">At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate</l>
     <l n="987">And said , in a new voice , but sweet as love ,</l>
     <l n="988">To Endymion 's amaze : “ By Cupid 's dove ,</l>
     <l n="989">And so thou shalt ! and by the lily truth</l>
     <l n="990">Of my own breast thou shalt , beloved youth ! ” 990</l>
     <l n="991">And as she spake , into her face there came</l>
     <l n="992">Light , as reflected from a silver flame :</l>
     <l n="993">Her long black hair swell 'd ampler , in display</l>
     <l n="994">Full golden ; in her eyes a brighter day</l>
     <l n="995">Dawn 'd blue and full of love . Aye , he beheld</l>
     <l n="996">Phœbe , his passion ! joyous she upheld</l>
     <l n="997">Her lucid bow , continuing thus : “ Drear , drear</l>
     <l n="998">Has our delaying been ; but foolish fear</l>
     <l n="999">Withheld me first ; and then decrees of fate ;</l>
     <l n="1000">And then ‘ twas fit that from this mortal state 1000</l>
     <l n="1001">Thou shouldst , my love , by some unlook 'd for change</l>
     <l n="1002">Be spiritualiz 'd . Peona , we shall range</l>
     <l n="1003">These forests , and to thee they safe shall be</l>
     <l n="1004">As was thy cradle ; hither shalt thou flee</l>
     <l n="1005">To meet us many a time . ” Next Cynthia bright</l>
     <l n="1006">Peona kiss 'd , and bless 'd with fair good night :</l>
     <l n="1007">Her brother kiss 'd her too , and knelt adown</l>
     <l n="1008">Before his goddess , in a blissful swoon .</l>
     <l n="1009">She gave her fair hands to him , and behold ,</l>
     <l n="1010">Before three swiftest kisses he had told , 1010</l>
     <l n="1011">They vanish 'd far away !— Peona went</l>
     <l n="1012">Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment .</l>
