    <p>THE ISLE OF PALMS .</p>
    <lg type="part" n="1">
     <head>CANTO FIRST .</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="35">
      <l n="39">It is the midnight hour :— the beauteous Sea ,</l>
      <l n="40">Calm as the cloudless heaven , the heaven discloses ,</l>
      <l n="41">While many a sparkling star , in quiet glee ,</l>
      <l n="42">Far down within the watery sky reposes .</l>
      <l n="43">As if the Ocean 's heart were stirr 'd</l>
      <l n="44">With inward life , a sound is heard ,</l>
      <l n="45">Like that of dreamer murmuring in his sleep ;</l>
      <l n="46">‘ Tis partly the billow , and partly the air ,</l>
      <l n="47">That lies like a garment floating fair</l>
      <l n="48">Above the happy Deep .</l>
      <l n="49">The sea , I ween , cannot be fann 'd</l>
      <l n="50">By evening freshness from the land ,</l>
      <l n="51">For the land it is far away ;</l>
      <l n="52">But God hath will 'd that the sky-born breeze</l>
      <l n="53">In the centre of the loneliest seas</l>
      <l n="54">Should ever sport and play .</l>
      <l n="55">The mighty Moon she sits above ,</l>
      <l n="56">Encircled with a zone of love ,</l>
      <l n="57">A zone of dim and tender light</l>
      <l n="58">That makes her wakeful eye more bright :</l>
      <l n="59">She seems to shine with a sunny ray ,</l>
      <l n="60">And the night looks like a mellow 'd day !</l>
      <l n="61">The gracious Mistress of the Main</l>
      <l n="62">Hath now an undisturbed reign ,</l>
      <l n="63">And from her silent throne looks down ,</l>
      <l n="64">As upon children of her own ,</l>
      <l n="65">On the waves that lend their gentle breast</l>
      <l n="66">In gladness for her couch of rest !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="36">
      <l n="67">My spirit sleeps amid the calm</l>
      <l n="68">The sleep of a new delight ;</l>
      <l n="69">And hopes that she ne'er may awake again ,</l>
      <l n="70">But for ever hang o'er the lovely main ,</l>
      <l n="71">And adore the lovely night .</l>
      <l n="72">Scarce conscious of an earthly frame ,</l>
      <l n="73">She glides away like a lambent flame ,</l>
      <l n="74">And in her bliss she sings ;</l>
      <l n="75">Now touching softly the Ocean 's breast ,</l>
      <l n="76">Now mid the stars she lies at rest ,</l>
      <l n="77">As if she sail 'd on wings !</l>
      <l n="78">Now bold as the brightest star that glows</l>
      <l n="79">More brightly since at first it rose ,</l>
      <l n="80">Looks down on the far-off flood ,</l>
      <l n="81">And there all breathless and alone ,</l>
      <l n="82">As the sky where she soars were a world of her own ,</l>
      <l n="83">She mocketh the gentle Mighty One</l>
      <l n="84">As he lies in his quiet mood .</l>
      <l n="85">“ Art thou , ” she breathes , “ the Tyrant grim</l>
      <l n="86">That scoffs at human prayers ,</l>
      <l n="87">Answering with prouder roaring the while ,</l>
      <l n="88">As it rises from some lonely isle ,</l>
      <l n="89">Through groans raised wild , the hopeless hymn</l>
      <l n="90">Of shipwreck 'd mariners ?</l>
      <l n="91">Oh ! Thou art harmless as a child</l>
      <l n="92">Weary with joy , and reconciled</l>
      <l n="93">For sleep to change its play ;</l>
      <l n="94">And now that night hath stay 'd thy race ,</l>
      <l n="95">Smiles wander o'er thy placid face</l>
      <l n="96">As if thy dreams were gay . ” —</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="37">
      <l n="97">And can it be that for me alone</l>
      <l n="98">The Main and Heavens are spread ?</l>
      <l n="99">Oh ! whither , in this holy hour ,</l>
      <l n="100">Have those fair creatures fled ,</l>
      <l n="101">To whom the ocean-plains are given</l>
      <l n="102">As clouds possess their native heaven ?</l>
      <l n="103">The tiniest boat , that ever sail 'd</l>
      <l n="104">Upon an inland lake ,</l>
      <l n="105">Might through this sea without a fear</l>
      <l n="106">Her silent journey take ,</l>
      <l n="107">Though the helmsman slept as if on land ,</l>
      <l n="108">And the oar had dropp 'd from the rower 's hand .</l>
      <l n="109">How like a monarch would she glide ,</l>
      <l n="110">While the husht billow kiss 'd her side</l>
      <l n="111">With low and lulling tone ,</l>
      <l n="112">Some stately Ship , that from afar</l>
      <l n="113">Shone sudden , like a rising star ,</l>
      <l n="114">With all her bravery on !</l>
      <l n="115">List ! how in murmurs of delight</l>
      <l n="116">The blessed airs of Heaven invite</l>
      <l n="117">The joyous bark to pass one night</l>
      <l n="118">Within their still domain !</l>
      <l n="119">O grief ! that yonder gentle Moon ,</l>
      <l n="120">Whose smiles for ever fade so soon ,</l>
      <l n="121">Should waste such smiles in vain .</l>
      <l n="122">Haste ! haste ! before the moonshine dies ,</l>
      <l n="123">Dissolved amid the morning skies ,</l>
      <l n="124">While yet the silvery glory lies</l>
      <l n="125">Above the sparkling foam ;</l>
      <l n="126">Bright mid surrounding brightness , Thou ,</l>
      <l n="127">Scattering fresh beauty from thy prow ,</l>
      <l n="128">In pomp and splendour come !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="38">
      <l n="129">And lo ! upon the murmuring waves</l>
      <l n="130">A glorious Shape appearing !</l>
      <l n="131">A broad-wing 'd Vessel , through the shower</l>
      <l n="132">Of glimmering lustre steering !</l>
      <l n="133">As if the beauteous ship enjoy 'd</l>
      <l n="134">The beauty of the sea ,</l>
      <l n="135">She lifteth up her stately head</l>
      <l n="136">And saileth joyfully .</l>
      <l n="137">A lovely path before her lies ,</l>
      <l n="138">A lovely path behind ;</l>
      <l n="139">She sails amid the loveliness</l>
      <l n="140">Like a thing with heart and mind .</l>
      <l n="141">Fit pilgrim through a scene so fair ,</l>
      <l n="142">Slowly she beareth on ;</l>
      <l n="143">A glorious phantom of the deep ,</l>
      <l n="144">Risen up to meet the Moon .</l>
      <l n="145">The Moon bids her tenderest radiance fall</l>
      <l n="146">On her wavy streamer and snow-white wings ,</l>
      <l n="147">And the quiet voice of the rocking sea</l>
      <l n="148">To cheer the gliding vision sings .</l>
      <l n="149">Oh ! ne'er did sky and water blend</l>
      <l n="150">In such a holy sleep ,</l>
      <l n="151">Or bathe in brighter quietude</l>
      <l n="152">A roamer of the deep .</l>
      <l n="153">So far the peaceful soul of Heaven</l>
      <l n="154">Hath settled on the sea ,</l>
      <l n="155">It seems as if this weight of calm</l>
      <l n="156">Were from eternity .</l>
      <l n="157">O World of Waters ! the stedfast earth</l>
      <l n="158">Ne er lay entranced like Thee !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="39">
      <l n="159">Is she a vision wild and bright ,</l>
      <l n="160">That sails amid the still moon-light</l>
      <l n="161">At the dreaming soul 's command ?</l>
      <l n="162">A vessel borne by magic gales ,</l>
      <l n="163">All rigg 'd with gossamery sails ,</l>
      <l n="164">And bound for Fairy-land ?</l>
      <l n="165">Ah ! no !— an earthly freight she bears ,</l>
      <l n="166">Of joys and sorrows , hopes and fears ;</l>
      <l n="167">And lonely as she seems to be ,</l>
      <l n="168">Thus left by herself on the moonlight sea</l>
      <l n="169">In loneliness that rolls ,</l>
      <l n="170">She hath a constant company ,</l>
      <l n="171">In sleep , or waking revelry ,</l>
      <l n="172">Five hundred human souls !</l>
      <l n="173">Since first she sail 'd from fair England ,</l>
      <l n="174">Three moons her path have cheer 'd ;</l>
      <l n="175">And another stands right over her masts</l>
      <l n="176">Since the Cape hath disappear 'd .</l>
      <l n="177">For an Indian Isle she shapes her way</l>
      <l n="178">With constant mind both night and day :</l>
      <l n="179">She seems to hold her home in view ,</l>
      <l n="180">And sails , as if the path she knew ;</l>
      <l n="181">So calm and stately is her motion</l>
      <l n="182">Across th ’ unfathom 'd trackless ocean .</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="40">
      <l n="183">And well , glad Vessel ! mayst thou stem</l>
      <l n="184">The tide with lofty breast ,</l>
      <l n="185">And lift thy queen-like diadem</l>
      <l n="186">O'er these thy realms of rest :</l>
      <l n="187">For a thousand beings , now far away ,</l>
      <l n="188">Behold thee in their sleep ,</l>
      <l n="189">And hush their beating hearts to pray</l>
      <l n="190">That a calm may clothe the deep .</l>
      <l n="191">When dimly descending behind the sea</l>
      <l n="192">From the Mountain Isle of Liberty ,</l>
      <l n="193">Oh ! many a sigh pursued thy vanish 'd sail ;</l>
      <l n="194">And oft an eager crowd will stand</l>
      <l n="195">With straining gaze on the Indian strand ,</l>
      <l n="196">Thy wonted gleam to hail .</l>
      <l n="197">For thou art laden with Beauty and Youth ,</l>
      <l n="198">With Honour bold , and spotless Truth ,</l>
      <l n="199">With fathers , who have left in a home of rest</l>
      <l n="200">Their infants smiling at the breast ,</l>
      <l n="201">With children , who have bade their parents farewell ,</l>
      <l n="202">Or who go to the land where their parents dwell .</l>
      <l n="203">God speed thy course , thou gleam of delight !</l>
      <l n="204">From rock and tempest clear ;</l>
      <l n="205">Till signal gun from friendly height</l>
      <l n="206">Proclaim , with thundering cheer ,</l>
      <l n="207">To joyful groupes on the harbour bright ,</l>
      <l n="208">That the good ship HOPE is near !</l>
     </lg>
     <lg type="stanza" n="41">
      <l n="209">Is no one on the silent deck</l>
      <l n="210">Save the helmsman who sings for a breeze ,</l>

      <l n="212">Still as the slumbering seas ?</l>
      <l n="213">Yes ! side by side , and hand in hand ,</l>
      <l n="214">Close to the prow two figures stand ,</l>
      <l n="215">Their shadows never stir ,</l>

      <l n="3122">Th ’ angelic infant sang , at times her voice ,</l>

   <p>WORDSWORTH .</p>
   <p>ADVERTISEMENT .</p>
   <p>The following Poem is the narrative of one day , the pleasantest of many pleasant ones , of a little Angling-excursion made three summers ago among the mountains of Westmoreland , Lancashire , and Cumberland . A tent , large panniers filled with its furniture , with provisions , &amp; c. were loaded upon horses , and while the anglers , who separated every morning , pursued each his own sport up the torrents , were carried over the mountains to the appointed place by some lake or stream , where they were to meet again in the evening .</p>
   <p>In this manner they visited all the wildest and most secluded scenes of the country . On the first Sunday they passed among the hills , their tent was pitched on the banks of Wast-Water , at the head of that wild and solitary lake , which they had reached by the mountain-path that passes Barn-Moor Tarn from Eskdale . Towards evening the inhabitants of the valley , not exceeding half a dozen families , with some too from the neighbouring glens , drawn by the unusual appearance , came to visit the strangers in their tent . Without , the evening was calm and beautiful ; within , were the gaiety and kindness of simple mirth . At a late hour , their guests departed under a most refulgent moon that lighted them up the surrounding mountains , on which they turned to hail with long-continued shouts and songs the blazing of a huge fire , that was hastily kindled at the door of the tent to bid them a distant farewell .</p>
   <p>The images and feelings of these few happy days , and above all , of that delightful evening , the author wished to preserve in poetry . What he has written , while it serves to himself and his friends as a record of past happiness , may , he hopes , without impropriety be offered to the public , since , if at all faithful to its subject , it will have some interest to those who delight in the wilder scenes of Nature , and who have studied with respect and love the character of their simple inhabitants .</p>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">The hush of bliss was on the sunny hills ,</l>
     <l n="2">The clouds were sleeping on the silent sky ,</l>
     <l n="3">We travelled in the midst of melody</l>
     <l n="4">Warbled around us from the mountain-rills .</l>
     <l n="5">The voice was like the glad voice of a friend</l>
     <l n="6">Murmuring a welcome to his happy home ;</l>
     <l n="7">We felt its kindness with our spirits blend ,</l>
     <l n="8">And said , “ This day no farther will we roam ! ”</l>
     <l n="9">The coldest heart that ever looked on heaven ,</l>
     <l n="10">Had surely felt the beauty of that day ,</l>
     <l n="11">And , as he paused , a gentle blessing given</l>
     <l n="12">To the sweet scene that tempted him to stay .</l>
     <l n="13">But we , who travelled through that region bright ,</l>
     <l n="14">Were joyful pilgrims under Nature 's care ,</l>
     <l n="15">From youth had loved the dreams of pure delight ,</l>
     <l n="16">Descending on us through the lonely air ,</l>
     <l n="17">When Heaven is clothed with smiles , and Earth as Heaven is fair !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="18">Seven lovely days had like a happy dream</l>
     <l n="19">Died in our spirits silently away ,</l>
     <l n="20">Since Grassmere , waking to the morning ray ,</l>
     <l n="21">Met our last lingering look with farewell gleam .</l>
     <l n="22">I may not tell what joy our beings filled ,</l>
     <l n="23">Wand'ring like shadows over plain and steep ,</l>
     <l n="24">What beauteous visions lonely souls can build</l>
     <l n="25">When ‘ mid the mountain solitude they sleep .</l>
     <l n="26">I may not tell how the deep power of sound</l>
     <l n="27">Can back to life long-faded dreams recall ,</l>
     <l n="28">When lying mid the noise that lives around</l>
     <l n="29">Through the hush 'd spirit flows a waterfall .</l>
     <l n="30">To thee , my WORDSWORTH !<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>whose inspired song</l>
     <l n="31">Comes forth in pomp from Nature 's inner shrine ,</l>
     <l n="32">To thee by birth-right such high themes belong ,</l>
     <l n="33">The unseen grandeur of the earth is thine !</l>
     <l n="34">One lowlier simple strain of human love be mine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="35">How leapt our hearts , when from an airy height ,</l>
     <l n="36">On which we paused for a sweet fountain 's sake ,</l>
     <l n="37">With green fields fading in a peaceful lake ,</l>
     <l n="38">A deep-sunk vale burst sudden on our sight !</l>
     <l n="39">We felt as if at home ; a magic sound ,</l>
     <l n="40">As from a spirit whom we must obey ,</l>
     <l n="41">Bade us descend into the vale profound ,</l>
     <l n="42">And in its silence pass the Sabbath-day .</l>
     <l n="43">The placid lake that rested far below ,</l>
     <l n="44">Softly embosoming another sky ,</l>
     <l n="45">Still as we gazed assumed a lovelier glow ,</l>
     <l n="46">And seem 'd to send us looks of amity .</l>
     <l n="47">Our hearts were open to the gracious love</l>
     <l n="48">Of Nature , smiling like a happy bride ;</l>
     <l n="49">So following the still impulse from above ,</l>
     <l n="50">Down the green slope we wind with airy glide ,</l>
     <l n="51">And pitch our snowy tent on that fair water 's side .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="52">Ah me ! even now I see before me stand ,</l>
     <l n="53">Among the verdant holly-boughs half hid ,</l>
     <l n="54">The little radiant airy pyramid ,</l>
     <l n="55">Like some wild dwelling built in Fairy land .</l>
     <l n="56">As silently as gathering cloud it rose ,</l>
     <l n="57">And seems a cloud descended on the earth ,</l>
     <l n="58">Disturbing not the Sabbath-day 's repose ,</l>
     <l n="59">Yet gently stirring at the quiet birth</l>
     <l n="60">Of every short-lived breeze : the sun-beams greet</l>
     <l n="61">The beauteous stranger in the lonely bay ;</l>
     <l n="62">Close to its shading tree two streamlets meet ,</l>
     <l n="63">With gentle glide , as weary of their play .</l>
     <l n="64">And in the liquid lustre of the lake</l>
     <l n="65">Its image sleeps , reflected far below ;</l>
     <l n="66">Such image as the clouds of summer make ,</l>
     <l n="67">Clear seen amid the waveless water 's glow ,</l>
     <l n="68">As slumbering infant still , and pure as April snow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="69">Wild though the dwelling seem , thus rising fair ,</l>
     <l n="70">A sudden stranger ‘ mid the sylvan scene ,</l>
     <l n="71">One spot of radiance on surrounding green ,</l>
     <l n="72">Human it is — and human souls are there !</l>
     <l n="73">Look through that opening in the canvass wall ,</l>
     <l n="74">Through which by fits the scarce-felt breezes play ,</l>
     <l n="75">— Upon three happy souls thine eyes will fall ,</l>
     <l n="76">The summer lambs are not more blest than they !</l>
     <l n="77">On the green turf all motionless they lie ,</l>
     <l n="78">In dreams romantic as the dreams of sleep ,</l>
     <l n="79">The filmy air slow-glimmering on their eye ,</l>
     <l n="80">And in their ear the murmur of the deep .</l>
     <l n="81">Or haply now by some wild winding brook ,</l>
     <l n="82">Deep , silent pool , or waters rushing loud ,</l>
     <l n="83">In thought they visit many a fairy nook</l>
     <l n="84">That rising mists in rainbow colours shroud ,</l>
     <l n="85">And ply the Angler 's sport involved in mountain-cloud !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="86">Yes ! dear to us that solitary trade ,</l>
     <l n="87">‘ Mid vernal peace in peacefulness pursued ,</l>
     <l n="88">Through rocky glen , wild moor , and hanging wood ,</l>
     <l n="89">White-flowering meadow , and romantic glade !</l>
     <l n="90">The sweetest visions of our boyish years</l>
     <l n="91">Come to our spirits with a murmuring tone</l>
     <l n="92">Of running waters ,— and one stream appears ,</l>
     <l n="93">Remember 'd all , tree , willow , bank , and stone !</l>
     <l n="94">How glad were we , when after sunny showers</l>
     <l n="95">Its voice came to us issuing from the school !</l>
     <l n="96">How fled the vacant , solitary hours ,</l>
     <l n="97">By dancing rivulet , or silent pool !</l>
     <l n="98">And still our souls retain in manhood 's prime</l>
     <l n="99">The love of joys our childish years that blest ;</l>
     <l n="100">So now encircled by these hills sublime ,</l>
     <l n="101">We Anglers , wandering with a tranquil breast ,</l>
     <l n="102">Build in this happy vale a fairy bower of rest !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="103">Within that bower are strewn in careless guise ,</l>
     <l n="104">Idle one day , the angler 's simple gear ;</l>
     <l n="105">Lines that , as fine as floating gossamer ,</l>
     <l n="106">Dropt softly on the stream the silken flies ;</l>
     <l n="107">The limber rod that shook its trembling length ,</l>
     <l n="108">Almost as airy as the line it threw ,</l>
     <l n="109">Yet often bending in an arch of strength</l>
     <l n="110">When the tired salmon rose at last to view ,</l>
     <l n="111">Now lightly leans across the rushy bed ,</l>
     <l n="112">On which at night we dream of sports by day ;</l>
     <l n="113">And , empty now , beside it close is laid</l>
     <l n="114">The goodly pannier framed of osiers gray ;</l>
     <l n="115">And , maple bowl in which we wont to bring</l>
     <l n="116">The limpid water from the morning wave ,</l>
     <l n="117">Or from some mossy and sequester 'd spring</l>
     <l n="118">To which dark rocks a grateful coolness gave ,</l>
     <l n="119">Such as might Hermit use in solitary cave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="120">And ne'er did Hermit , with a purer breast ,</l>
     <l n="121">Amid the depths of sylvan silence pray ,</l>
     <l n="122">Than prayed we friends on that mild quiet day ,</l>
     <l n="123">By God and man beloved , the day of rest !</l>
     <l n="124">All passions in our souls were lull 'd to sleep ,</l>
     <l n="125">Ev'n by the power of Nature 's holy bliss ;</l>
     <l n="126">While Innocence her watch in peace did keep</l>
     <l n="127">Over the spirit 's thoughtful happiness !</l>
     <l n="128">We view 'd the green earth with a loving look ,</l>
     <l n="129">Like us rejoicing in the gracious sky ;</l>
     <l n="130">A voice came to us from the running brook</l>
     <l n="131">That seem 'd to breathe a grateful melody .</l>
     <l n="132">Then all things seem 'd embued with life and sense ,</l>
     <l n="133">And as from dreams with kindling smiles to wake ,</l>
     <l n="134">Happy in beauty and in innocence ;</l>
     <l n="135">While , pleased our inward quiet to partake ,</l>
     <l n="136">Lay hush 'd , as in a trance , the scarcely-breathing lake .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="137">Yet think not , in this wild and fairy spot ,</l>
     <l n="138">This mingled happiness of earth and heaven ,</l>
     <l n="139">Which to our hearts this Sabbath-day was given ,</l>
     <l n="140">Think not , that far-off friends were quite forgot .</l>
     <l n="141">Helm-crag arose before our half-closed eyes</l>
     <l n="142">With colours brighter than the brightening dove ;</l>
     <l n="143">Beneath that guardian mount a<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>cottage lies</l>
     <l n="144">Encircled by the halo breathed from Love !</l>
     <l n="145">And sweet that dwelling<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>rests upon the brow</l>
     <l n="146">( Beneath its sycamore ) of Orest-hill ,</l>
     <l n="147">As if it smiled on Windermere below ,</l>
     <l n="148">Her green recesses and her islands still !</l>
     <l n="149">Thus , gently-blended many a human thought</l>
     <l n="150">With those that peace and solitude supplied ,</l>
     <l n="151">Till in our hearts the moving kindness wrought</l>
     <l n="152">With gradual influence , like a flowing tide ,</l>
     <l n="153">And for the lovely sound of human voice we sigh 'd .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="154">And hark ! a laugh , with voices blended , stole</l>
     <l n="155">Across the water , echoing from the shore !</l>
     <l n="156">And during pauses short , the beating oar</l>
     <l n="157">Brings the glad music closer to the soul .</l>
     <l n="158">We leave our tent ; and lo ! a lovely sight</l>
     <l n="159">Glides like a living creature through the air ,</l>
     <l n="160">For air the water seems thus passing bright ,</l>
     <l n="161">A living creature beautiful and fair !</l>
     <l n="162">Nearer it glides ; and now the radiant glow</l>
     <l n="163">That on its radiant shadow seems to float ,</l>
     <l n="164">Turns to a virgin band , a glorious shew ,</l>
     <l n="165">Rowing with happy smiles a little boat .</l>
     <l n="166">Towards the tent their lingering course they steer ,</l>
     <l n="167">And cheerful now upon the shore they stand ,</l>
     <l n="168">In maiden bashfulness , yet free from fear ,</l>
     <l n="169">And by our side , gay-moving hand in hand ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="171">Scarce from our hearts had gone the sweet surprise ,</l>

     <l n="174">From the mild lustre of their smiling eyes ,</l>
     <l n="175">Ere the tent seem 'd encircled by the sound</l>
     <l n="176">Of many voices ; in an instant stood</l>
     <l n="177">Men , women , children , all the circle round ,</l>

     <l n="180">Our late so solitary dwelling fill ;</l>
     <l n="181">And strange to hear their greetings mingling loud</l>
     <l n="182">Where all before was undisturb 'd and still .</l>
     <l n="183">Yet was the stir delightful to our ear ,</l>
     <l n="184">And moved to happiness our inmost blood ,</l>
     <l n="185">The sudden change , the unexpected cheer ,</l>
     <l n="186">Breaking like sunshine on a pensive mood ,</l>
     <l n="187">This breath and voice of life in seeming solitude !</l>

     <l n="188">Hard task it was , in our small tent to find</l>

     <l n="191">I ween they soon were seated to their mind !</l>
     <l n="192">Some viewing with a hesitating look</l>
     <l n="193">The panniers that contained our travelling fare ,</l>

     <l n="198">While many a gentle look , and whisper sweet ,</l>
     <l n="199">Brought to the stripling 's face a gladsome pride .</l>
     <l n="200">The playful children on the velvet green ,</l>
     <l n="201">Soon as the first-felt bashfulness was fled ,</l>
     <l n="202">Smiled to each other at the wondrous scene ,</l>
     <l n="203">And whisper 'd words they to each other said ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="205">Then did we learn that this our stranger tent ,</l>

     <l n="208">A gentle shock of pleased astonishment .</l>
     <l n="209">The lonely dwellers by the lofty rills ,</l>
     <l n="210">Gazed in surprise upon th ’ unwonted sight ,</l>
     <l n="211">The wandering shepherds saw it from the hills ,</l>
     <l n="212">And quick descended from their airy height .</l>
     <l n="213">Soon as the voice of simple song and prayer</l>
     <l n="214">Ceased in the little chapel of the dell ,</l>
     <l n="215">The congregation did in peace repair</l>
     <l n="216">To the lake-side , to view our wondrous cell .</l>

     <l n="225">Each other with glad voice and kindly name .</l>
     <l n="226">Here a pleased daughter to her father smiled ,</l>
     <l n="227">With fresh affection in her soften 'd eyes ;</l>

     <l n="235">Close to their husbands ’ or their children 's side ,</l>
     <l n="236">A neighbour 's friendly greeting interchanged ,</l>

    <head>THE HERMITAGE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Stranger ! this lonely glen in ancient times</l>
     <l n="2">Was named the glen of blood ; nor Christian feet</l>
     <l n="3">By night or day , from these o'erhYpppHeNarching cliffs</l>
     <l n="4">That haply now have to thy joyful shouts</l>
     <l n="5">Return 'd a mellow music , ever brought</l>
     <l n="6">One trembling sound to break the depth of silence .</l>
     <l n="7">The village maiden , in this little stream ,</l>
     <l n="8">Though then , as now , most clearly beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="9">Ne'er steeped her simple garments , while she sang</l>
     <l n="10">Some native air of sadness or of mirth .</l>
     <l n="11">In these cold , shady pools , the fearless trout</l>
     <l n="12">Ne'er saw the shadow , but of sailing cloud ,</l>
     <l n="13">Or kite that wheeling eyed the far-off lamb ;</l>
     <l n="14">And on yon hazel bowers the ripen 'd fruit</l>
     <l n="15">Hung clustering , moved but by the frequent swing</l>
     <l n="16">Of playful squirrel ,— for no school-boy here</l>
     <l n="17">With crook and angle light on holiday</l>
     <l n="18">Came nutting , or to snare the sportive fry .</l>
     <l n="19">Even bolder spirits shunn 'd the glen of blood !</l>
     <l n="20">These rocks , the abode of echo , never mock 'd</l>
     <l n="21">In sportive din the huntsman 's bugle horn ;</l>
     <l n="22">And as the shepherd from the mountain-fold</l>
     <l n="23">Homewards return 'd beneath the silent Moon ,</l>
     <l n="24">A low unconscious prayer would agitate</l>
     <l n="25">His breathless heart , for here in unblest grave</l>
     <l n="26">Lay one for whom ne'er toll 'd the passing-bell !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="27">And thus was Nature by the impious guilt</l>
     <l n="28">Of one who scorn 'd her gracious solitude ,</l>
     <l n="29">Defrauded of her worshippers : though pure</l>
     <l n="30">This glen , as consecrated house of God ,</l>
     <l n="31">Fit haunt of heaven-aspiring piety ,</l>
     <l n="32">Or in whose dripping cells the poet 's ear</l>
     <l n="33">Might list unearthly music , this sweet glen</l>
     <l n="34">With all its tender tints and pensive sounds ,</l>
     <l n="35">Its balmy fragrance and romantic forms ,</l>
     <l n="36">Lay lonely and unvisited , yea worse ,</l>
     <l n="37">Peopled with fancied demons , and the brood</l>
     <l n="38">At enmity with man .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">So was it once :</l>
     <l n="40">But now far other creed hath sanctified</l>
     <l n="41">This dim seclusion , and all human hearts</l>
     <l n="42">Unto its spirit deeply reconciled .</l>
     <l n="43">‘ Tis said , and I in truth believe the tale ,</l>
     <l n="44">That many years ago an aged man ,</l>
     <l n="45">Of a divine aspect and stately form ,</l>
     <l n="46">Came to this glen , and took up his abode</l>
     <l n="47">In one of those wild caves so numerous</l>
     <l n="48">Among the hanging cliffs , though hid from view</l>
     <l n="49">By trailing ivy , or thick holly-bush ,</l>
     <l n="50">Through the whole year so deeply , brightly green .</l>
     <l n="51">With evil eye the simple villagers</l>
     <l n="52">First look 'd on him , and scarcely dared to tell</l>
     <l n="53">Each other , what dim fears were in their souls .</l>
     <l n="54">But there is something in the voice and eye</l>
     <l n="55">Of beautiful old age , with angel power</l>
     <l n="56">That charms away suspicion , and compels</l>
     <l n="57">The unwilling soul to reverence and love .</l>
     <l n="58">So was it with this mystical old man !</l>
     <l n="59">When first he came into the glen , the spring</l>
     <l n="60">Had just begun to tinge the sullen rocks</l>
     <l n="61">With transient smiles , and ere the leafy bowers</l>
     <l n="62">Of summer rustled , many a visitant</l>
     <l n="63">Had sat within his hospitable cave ,</l>
     <l n="64">From his maple bowl the unpolluted spring</l>
     <l n="65">Drunk fearless , and with him partook the bread</l>
     <l n="66">That his pale lips most reverently had bless 'd</l>
     <l n="67">With words becoming such a holy man !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="68">Oft was he seen surrounded by a groupe</l>
     <l n="69">Of happy children , unto whom he spake</l>
     <l n="70">With more than a paternal tenderness ;</l>
     <l n="71">And they who once had gazed with trembling fear</l>
     <l n="72">On the wild dweller in th ’ unholy glen ,</l>
     <l n="73">At last with airy trip and gladsome song</l>
     <l n="74">Would seek him there , and listen on his knee</l>
     <l n="75">To mournful ditties , and most touching tales !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="76">One only book was in this hermit 's cell ,</l>
     <l n="77">The Book of Life ; and when from it he read</l>
     <l n="78">With solemn voice devoutly musical ,</l>
     <l n="79">His thoughtful eye still brightening as the words ,</l>
     <l n="80">The words of Jesus , in that peaceful cave</l>
     <l n="81">Sounded more holily ,— and his grey hair ,</l>
     <l n="82">Betokening that e'er long in Jesus ’ breast</l>
     <l n="83">Would be his blessed sleep ,— on his calm brows</l>
     <l n="84">Spread quietly , like thin and snowy clouds</l>
     <l n="85">On the husht evening sky :— While thus he sate ,</l>
     <l n="86">Ev'n like the Apostle whom our Saviour loved ,</l>
     <l n="87">In his old age , in Patmos ’ lonely isle</l>
     <l n="88">Musing on him that he had served in youth ,—</l>
     <l n="89">Oh ! then , I ween , the awe-struck villagers</l>
     <l n="90">Could scarce sustain his tones so deeply charged</l>
     <l n="91">With hope , and faith , and gratitude , and joy .</l>
     <l n="92">But when they gazed !— in the mild lineaments</l>
     <l n="93">Of his majestic visage , they beheld</l>
     <l n="94">How beautiful is holiness , and deem 'd</l>
     <l n="95">That sure he was some spirit sent by God</l>
     <l n="96">To teach the way to Heaven !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="97">And yet his voice</l>
     <l n="98">Was oft times sadder , than as they conceived</l>
     <l n="99">An Angel 's voice would be , and though to sooth</l>
     <l n="100">The sorrows of all others ever seem 'd</l>
     <l n="101">His only end in life , perhaps he had</l>
     <l n="102">Griefs of his own of which he nothing spake ;</l>
     <l n="103">Else were his locks more grey , more pale his cheek ,</l>
     <l n="104">Than one had thought who only saw his form</l>
     <l n="105">So stately and so tall .—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="106">Once did they speak</l>
     <l n="107">To him of that most miserable man</l>
     <l n="108">Who here himself had slain ,— and then his eye</l>
     <l n="109">Was glazed with stern compassion , and a tear ,—</l>
     <l n="110">It was the first they e'er had seen him shed ,</l>
     <l n="111">Though mercy was the attribute he loved</l>
     <l n="112">Dearest in God 's own Son ,— bedimm 'd its light</l>
     <l n="113">For a short moment ; yea , that hermit old</l>
     <l n="114">Wept ,— and his sadden 'd face angelical</l>
     <l n="115">Veil 'd with his wither 'd hands ,— then on their knees</l>
     <l n="116">He bade his children ( so he loved to call</l>
     <l n="117">The villagers ) kneel down ; and unto God</l>
     <l n="118">Pray for his brother 's soul .—</l>

     <l n="119">Amid the dust</l>

     <l n="126">Tradition calls his grave . On Sabbath-day ,</l>
     <l n="127">The hind oft hears the legendary tale</l>

     <l n="16">That makes a pious hymning melody .</l>

     <l n="22">When all the silent heavens appear their own .</l>
     <l n="23">And lo ! an infant shews his gladsome face !</l>
     <l n="24">His beautiful and shining golden head</l>
     <l n="25">Lies on his mother 's bosom , like a rose</l>
     <l n="26">Fallen on a lilied bank . A dewy light</l>

     <l n="30">To reach the kisses mantling from her soul .</l>
     <l n="31">— And now , the baby in his cradle sleeps ,</l>
     <l n="32">Hush 'd by his mother 's prayer ! How soft her tread</l>
     <l n="33">Falls , like a snow-flake , on the noiseless floor !</l>

     <l n="39">Unceasing greetings of congenial thought ,</l>
     <l n="40">Deep blendings of existence ; till awoke</l>
     <l n="41">By the long stirring of delightful dreams ,</l>
     <l n="42">She with a silent prayer of thankfulness</l>

     <l n="48">Guards , powerful as the sword of cherubim ,</l>
     <l n="49">The hallow 'd porch . She hath a heavenly smile</l>

     <l n="51">And wins him o'er to virtue , so transforms</l>
     <l n="52">The purpose of his heart , that sudden shame</l>
     <l n="53">Smothers the curses struggling into birth ,</l>
     <l n="54">And makes him turn an eye of kindliness</l>
     <l n="55">Even on the blessings that he came to blast .</l>

     <l n="59">The dire , contagious pestilence of sin</l>
     <l n="60">May walk abroad , and lay its victims low ;</l>
     <l n="61">But they , whose upright spirits worship thee ,</l>
     <l n="62">Breathe not the tainted air — they live apart</l>
     <l n="63">Unharm 'd , as Israel 's heaven-protected sons ,</l>
     <l n="64">When the exterminating angel pass 'd</l>
     <l n="65">With steps of blood o'er Egypt 's groaning land .</l>
     <l n="66">Then ever keep unbroken and unstained</l>
     <l n="67">The sabbath-sanctity of home ; the shrine</l>
     <l n="68">Where spirit in its rapture worships God .</l>
     <l n="69">By Heaven beloved for ever are the walls</l>
     <l n="70">That duly every morn and evening hear</l>
     <l n="71">Our whisper 'd hymns ! Eternity broods there .</l>
     <l n="72">Yea ! like a father smiling on a band</l>
     <l n="73">Of happy children , the Almighty One</l>
     <l n="74">Dwells in the midst of us , appearing oft</l>
     <l n="75">In visible glory , while our filial souls ,</l>
     <l n="76">Made pure beneath the watching of his eye ,</l>
     <l n="77">Walk stately in the conscious praise of Heaven !</l>

     <l n="61">A blessing on this temple , and admire</l>
     <l n="62">The gaudy pendant round the painted staff</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Why sits so long beside you cottage-door</l>
     <l n="2">That aged man with tresses thin and hoar ?</l>
     <l n="3">Fix 'd are his eyes in one continued gaze ,</l>
     <l n="4">Nor seem to feel the sun 's meridian blaze ;</l>
     <l n="5">Yet are the orbs with youth-like colours bright ,</l>
     <l n="6">As o'er the Iris falls the trembling light .</l>
     <l n="7">Changeless his mien ; not even one flitting trace</l>
     <l n="8">Of spirit wanders o'er his furrow 'd face ;</l>
     <l n="9">No feeling moves his venerable head :</l>
     <l n="10">— He sitteth there — an emblem of the dead !</l>
     <l n="11">The staff of age lies near him on the seat ,</l>
     <l n="12">His faithful dog is slumbering at his feet ,</l>
     <l n="13">And you fair child , who steals an hour for play</l>
     <l n="14">While thus her father rests upon his way ,</l>
     <l n="15">Her sport will leave , nor cast one look behind ,</l>
     <l n="16">Soon as she hears his voice ,— for he is blind !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="17">List ! as in tones through deep affection mild</l>
     <l n="18">He speaks by name to the delighted child !</l>
     <l n="19">Then , bending mute in dreams of painful bliss ,</l>
     <l n="20">Breathes o'er her neck a father 's tenderest kiss ,</l>
     <l n="21">And with light hand upon her forehead fair</l>
     <l n="22">Smooths the stray ringlets of her silky hair !</l>
     <l n="23">A beauteous phantom rises through the night</l>
     <l n="24">For ever brooding o'er his darken 'd sight ,</l>
     <l n="25">So clearly imaged both in form and limb ,</l>
     <l n="26">He scarce remembers that his eyes are dim ,</l>
     <l n="27">But thinks he sees in truth the vernal wreath</l>
     <l n="28">His gentle infant wove , that it might breathe</l>
     <l n="29">A sweet restoring fragrance through his breast ,</l>
     <l n="30">Chosen from the wild-flowers that he loves the best .</l>
     <l n="31">In that sweet trance he sees the sparkling glee</l>
     <l n="32">That sanctifies the face of infancy ;</l>
     <l n="33">The dimpled cheek where playful fondness lies ,</l>
     <l n="34">And the blue softness of her smiling eyes ;</l>
     <l n="35">The spirit 's temple unprofaned by tears ,</l>
     <l n="36">Where God 's unclouded loveliness appears ;</l>
     <l n="37">Those gleams of soul to every feature given ,</l>
     <l n="38">When youth walks guiltless by the light of heaven !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="39">And oh ! what pleasures through his spirit burn ,</l>
     <l n="40">When to the gate his homeward steps return ;</l>
     <l n="41">When fancy 's eye the curling smoke surveys ,</l>
     <l n="42">And his own hearth is gaily heard to blaze !</l>
     <l n="43">How beams his sightless visage ! when the press</l>
     <l n="44">Of Love 's known hand , with cheerful tenderness ,</l>
     <l n="45">Falls on his arm , and leads with guardian care</l>
     <l n="46">His helpless footsteps to the accustomed chair ;</l>
     <l n="47">When that dear voice he joy 'd from youth to hear</l>
     <l n="48">With kind enquiry comes unto his ear ,</l>
     <l n="49">And tremulous tells how lovely still must be</l>
     <l n="50">Those fading beauties that he ne'er must see !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="51">Though ne'er by him his cottage-home be seen ,</l>

     <l n="53">Though the bee , slowly borne on laden wing ,</l>
     <l n="54">To him be known but by its murmuring ;</l>
     <l n="55">And the long leaf that trembles in the breeze</l>
     <l n="56">Be all that tells him of his native trees ;</l>
     <l n="57">Yet dear to him each viewless object round</l>
     <l n="58">Familiar to his soul from touch or sound .</l>
     <l n="59">The stream , ‘ mid banks of osier winding near ,</l>
     <l n="60">Lulls his calm spirit through the listening ear :</l>
     <l n="61">Deeply his soul enjoys the loving strife</l>
     <l n="62">When the warm summer air is fill 'd with life ;</l>
     <l n="63">And as his limbs in quiet dreams are laid ,</l>
     <l n="64">Blest is the oak 's contemporary shade .</l>

     <l n="65">Happy old Man ! no vain regrets intrude</l>
     <l n="66">On the still hour of sightless solitude .</l>
     <l n="67">Though deepest shades o'er outward Nature roll ,</l>
     <l n="68">Her cloudless beauty lives within thy soul</l>
     <l n="69">— Oft to you rising mount thy steps ascend ,</l>
     <l n="70">As to the spot where dwelt a former friend ;</l>
     <l n="71">From whose green summit thou could'st once behold</l>
     <l n="72">Mountains far-off in dim confusion roll 'd ,</l>
     <l n="73">Lakes of blue mist , where gleam 'd the whitening sail ,</l>
     <l n="74">And many a woodland interposing vale .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="75">Thou seest them still : and oh ! how soft a shade</l>
     <l n="76">Does memory breathe o'er mountain , wood , and glade !</l>
     <l n="77">Each craggy pass , where oft in sportive scorn</l>
     <l n="78">Had sprung thy limbs in life 's exulting morn ;</l>
     <l n="79">Each misty cataract , and torrent-flood ,</l>
     <l n="80">Where thou a silent angler oft hast stood ;</l>
     <l n="81">Each shelter 'd creek where through the roughest day</l>
     <l n="82">Floated thy bark without the anchor 's stay ;</l>
     <l n="83">Each nameless field by nameless thought endear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="84">Each little hedge-row that thy childhood rear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="85">That seems unalter 'd yet in form and size ,</l>
     <l n="86">Though fled the clouds of fifty summer skies ,</l>
     <l n="87">Rise on thy soul ,— on high devotion springs</l>
     <l n="88">Through Nature 's beauty borne on Fancy 's wings ,</l>
     <l n="89">And while the blissful vision floats around ,</l>
     <l n="90">Of loveliest form , fair hue , and melting sound ,</l>
     <l n="91">Thou carest not , though blindness may not roam ,—</l>

     <l n="4">With wildering fancy and her kindred powers</l>
     <l n="5">High converse , to descend as from the clouds</l>
     <l n="6">Into a quiet valley , fill 'd with trees</l>
     <l n="7">By Nature planted , crowding round the brink</l>
     <l n="8">Of an oft-hidden rivulet , or hung</l>

     <l n="10">And bearing in his grasp the spear of truth ,</l>
     <l n="11">Fit to destroy and save ,— went forth to wage ,</l>
     <l n="12">Against the fierce array of bloody men ,</l>
     <l n="13">Avarice and ignorance , cruelty and hate ,</l>
     <l n="14">A holy warfare ! Deep within his soul ,</l>
     <l n="15">The groans of anguish , and the clank of chains ,</l>
     <l n="16">Dwelt ceaseless as a cataract , and fill 'd</l>
     <l n="17">The secret haunts of meditative prayer .</l>
     <l n="18">Encircled by the silence of the hearth ,</l>
     <l n="19">The evening-silence of a happy home ;</l>
     <l n="20">Upon his midnight bed , when working soul</l>
     <l n="21">Turns inward , and the steady flow of thought</l>
     <l n="22">Is all we feel of life ; in crowded rooms ,</l>
     <l n="23">Where mere sensation oft takes place of mind ,</l>
     <l n="24">And all time seems the present ; in the sun ,</l>
     <l n="25">The joyful splendour of a summer-day ;</l>
     <l n="26">Or ‘ neath the moon , the calm and gentle night ;</l>
     <l n="27">Where'er he moved , one vision ever fill 'd</l>
     <l n="28">His restless spirit . ‘ Twas a vision bright</l>
     <l n="29">With colours born in Heaven , yet oh ! bedimm 'd</l>
     <l n="30">With breath of sorrow , sighs , and tears , and blood !</l>
     <l n="31">Before him lay a quarter of the world ,</l>
     <l n="32">A Mighty Land , wash 'd by unnumber 'd floods ,</l>
     <l n="33">Born in her bosom ,— floods that to the sea</l>
     <l n="34">Roll ocean-like , or in the central wilds</l>
     <l n="35">Fade like the dim day melting into night ;</l>
     <l n="36">A land all teeming with the gorgeous shew</l>
     <l n="37">Of Nature in profuse magnificence !</l>
     <l n="38">Vallies and groves , where untamed herds have ranged</l>
     <l n="39">Without a master since the birth of time !</l>
     <l n="40">Fountains and caves fill 'd with the hidden light</l>
     <l n="41">Of diamond and of ruby , only view 'd</l>
     <l n="42">With admiration by the unenvying sun !</l>
     <l n="43">Millions of beings like himself he sees</l>
     <l n="44">In stature and in soul ,— the sons of God ,</l>
     <l n="45">Destined to do him homage , and to lift</l>
     <l n="46">Their fearless brows unto the burning sky ,</l>
     <l n="47">Stamp 'd with his holy image ! Noble shapes ,</l>
     <l n="48">Kings of the desert , men whose stately tread</l>
     <l n="49">Brings from the dust the sound of liberty !</l>
     <l n="50">The vision fades not here ; he sees the gloom</l>
     <l n="51">That lies upon these kingdoms of the sun ,</l>
     <l n="52">And makes them darker than the dreary realms ,</l>
     <l n="53">Scarce-moving at the pole .— A sluggish flow</l>
     <l n="54">Attends those floods so great and beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="55">Rolling in majesty that none adores !</l>
     <l n="56">And lo ! the faces of those stately men ,</l>
     <l n="57">Silent as death , or changed to ghastly shapes</l>
     <l n="58">By madness and despair ! His ears are torn</l>
     <l n="59">By shrieks and ravings , loud , and long , and wild ,</l>
     <l n="60">Or the deep-mutter 'd curse of sullen hearts ,</l>
     <l n="61">Scorning in bitter woe their gnawing chains !</l>
     <l n="62">He sees , and shuddering feels the vision true ,</l>
     <l n="63">A pale-faced band , who in his mother-isle</l>
     <l n="64">First look 'd upon the day , beneath its light</l>
     <l n="65">Dare to be tyrants , and with coward deeds</l>
     <l n="66">Sullying the glory of the Queen of Waves !</l>
     <l n="67">He sees that famous Isle , whose very winds</l>
     <l n="68">Dissolve like icicles the tyrant 's chains ,</l>
     <l n="69">On Afric bind them firm as adamant ,</l>
     <l n="70">Yet boast , with false and hollow gratitude ,</l>
     <l n="71">Of all the troubled nations of the earth</l>
     <l n="72">That she alone is free ! The awful sight</l>
     <l n="73">Appals not him ; he draws his lonely breath</l>
     <l n="74">Without a tremor ; for a voice is heard</l>
     <l n="75">Breathed by no human lips ,— heard by his soul ,—</l>
     <l n="76">That he by Heaven is chosen to restore</l>
     <l n="77">Mercy on earth , a mighty conqueror</l>
     <l n="78">Over the sins and miseries of man .</l>
     <l n="79">The work is done ! the Niger 's sullen waves</l>
     <l n="80">Have heard the tidings ,— and the orient Sun</l>
     <l n="81">Beholds them rolling on to meet his light</l>
     <l n="82">In joyful beauty .— Tombut 's spiry towers</l>
     <l n="83">Are bright without the brightness of the day ,</l>
     <l n="84">And Houssa wakening from his age-long trance</l>
     <l n="85">Of woe , amid the desert , smiles to hear</l>
     <l n="86">The last faint echo of the blissful sound .—</l>

     <l n="8">On fancy 's wing , and in her magic bowers</l>
     <l n="9">Reposed , by wildest music sung to sleep :—</l>
     <l n="10">So that , enamour 'd of the imaged forms</l>
     <l n="11">Of beauty in his soul , with holiest zeal</l>

     <l n="14">That his love</l>

     <l n="18">Rather than startling glories of the eye ,</l>
     <l n="19">Owe its enthronement in his inmost heart ,</l>
     <l n="20">I led him to behold a little lake ,</l>

     <l n="27">Before we reached</l>

     <l n="29">Into involuntary praise of all</l>
     <l n="30">Its pensive loveliness , my happy heart</l>

     <l n="34">The undying sunshine of a poet 's soul ,</l>
     <l n="35">I breathed such touching strains as suited well</l>
     <l n="36">The mild spring-day , and that secluded scene ,</l>
     <l n="37">Towards which , in full assurance of delight ,</l>
     <l n="38">We two then walked in peace .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">

     <l n="46">Enrobed in loveliest radiance , such as oft</l>
     <l n="47">Had steep 'd my spirit in a holy calm ,</l>

     <l n="67">Of its original brightness : Much was there ,</l>
     <l n="68">Marring the spirit I remembered once</l>
     <l n="69">Perfectly beautiful . The meadow field ,</l>
     <l n="70">That with its rich and placid verdure lay</l>
     <l n="71">Even like a sister-lake , with nought to break</l>

     <l n="73">Of the hoar Canna , or , more snowy white ,</l>

     <l n="79">The little birds , content to flit along</l>
     <l n="80">From bush to bush , could never dare to fly ,</l>
     <l n="81">Preserved from those who knew no ill intent ,</l>
     <l n="82">Fruit-trees exotic , and flowers passing rare ,</l>

     <l n="1">Is this the Lake , the cradle of the storms ,</l>
     <l n="2">Where silence never tames the mountain-roar ,</l>
     <l n="3">Where poets fear their self-created forms ,</l>
     <l n="4">Or , sunk in trance severe , their God adore ?</l>
     <l n="5">Is this the Lake , for ever dark and loud</l>
     <l n="6">With wave and tempest , cataract and cloud ?</l>
     <l n="7">Wondrous , O Nature ! is thy sovereign power ,</l>
     <l n="8">That gives to horror hours of peaceful mirth :</l>
     <l n="9">For here might beauty build her summer-bower !</l>
     <l n="10">Lo ! where you rainbow spans the smiling earth ,</l>
     <l n="11">And , clothed in glory , through a silent shower</l>
     <l n="12">The mighty Sun comes forth , a godlike birth ;</l>
     <l n="13">While , ‘ neath his loving eye , the gentle Lake</l>
     <l n="14">Lies like a sleeping child too blest to wake !</l>

     <l n="1">Go up among the mountains , when the storm</l>
     <l n="2">Of midnight howls , but go in that wild mood ,</l>
     <l n="3">When the soul loves tumultuous solitude ,</l>
     <l n="4">And through the haunted air , each giant form</l>
     <l n="5">Of swinging pine , black rock , or ghostly cloud ,</l>
     <l n="6">That veils some fearful cataract tumbling loud ,</l>

     <l n="8">‘ Mid those gaunt , shapeless things thou art alone !</l>
     <l n="9">The mind exists , thinks , trembles through the ear ,</l>
     <l n="10">The memory of the human world is gone ,</l>
     <l n="11">And time and space seem living only here .</l>
     <l n="12">Oh ! worship thou the visions then made known ,</l>

     <l n="4">The viewless eagles in wild screams rejoice .</l>
     <l n="5">The echoes answer to the unearthly noise</l>
     <l n="6">Of hurling rocks , that , plunged into the Lake ,</l>
     <l n="7">Send up a sullen groan : from clefts and caves ,</l>
     <l n="8">As of half-murder 'd wretch , hark ! yells awake ,</l>

    <head>Two Editions of this little Poem have been already published ; and its reception among those whom the author most wished to please , has induced him to include it in this volume .</head>

     <l n="1">With tearless eyes and undisturbed heart ,</l>
     <l n="2">O Bard ! of sinless life and holiest song ,</l>
     <l n="3">I muse upon thy death-bed and thy grave ;</l>
     <l n="4">Though round that grave the trodden grass still lies</l>
     <l n="5">Besmeared with clay ; for many feet were there ,</l>
     <l n="6">Fast-rooted to the spot , when slowly sank</l>
     <l n="7">Thy coffin , GRAHAME ! into the quiet cell .</l>
     <l n="8">Yet , well I loved thee , even as one might love</l>
     <l n="9">An elder brother , imaged in the soul</l>
     <l n="10">With solemn features , half-creating awe ,</l>
     <l n="11">But smiling still with gentleness and peace .</l>
     <l n="12">Tears have I shed when thy most mournful voice</l>
     <l n="13">Did tremblingly breathe forth that touching air ,</l>
     <l n="14">By Scottish shepherd haply framed of old ,</l>
     <l n="15">Amid the silence of his pastoral hills ,</l>
     <l n="16">Weeping the flowers on Flodden-field that died .</l>
     <l n="17">Wept , too , have I , when thou didst simply read</l>
     <l n="18">From thine own lays so simply beautiful</l>
     <l n="19">Some short pathetic tale of human grief ,</l>
     <l n="20">Or orison or hymn of deeper love ,</l>
     <l n="21">That might have won the sceptic 's sullen heart</l>
     <l n="22">To gradual adoration , and belief</l>
     <l n="23">Of Him who died for us upon the cross .</l>
     <l n="24">Yea ! oft when thou wert well , and in the calm</l>
     <l n="25">Of thy most Christian spirit blessing all</l>
     <l n="26">Who look 'd upon thee , with those gentlest smiles</l>
     <l n="27">That never lay on human face but thine ;</l>
     <l n="28">Even when thy serious eyes were lighted up</l>
     <l n="29">With kindling mirth , and from thy lips distill 'd</l>
     <l n="30">Words soft as dew , and cheerful as the dawn ,</l>
     <l n="31">Then , too , I could have wept , for on thy face ,</l>

     <l n="33">By other cause impair 'd than length of years ,</l>
     <l n="34">Lay something that still turn 'd the thoughtful heart</l>
     <l n="35">To melancholy dreams , dreams of decay ,</l>
     <l n="36">Of death and burial , and the silent tomb .</l>

     <l n="40">Tears could I give thee , when thou wert alive ,</l>
     <l n="41">The mournful tears of deep foreboding love</l>
     <l n="42">That might not be restrain 'd ; but now they seem</l>
     <l n="43">Most idle all ! thy worldly course is o'er ,</l>

     <l n="51">Familiar to their hearts , who felt that heaven</l>
     <l n="52">Did therein speak , when suddenly it fell</l>
     <l n="53">Mute , and for ever ! Empty now and still</l>
     <l n="54">The holy house which thou didst meekly grace ,</l>
     <l n="55">When with uplifted hand , and eye devout ,</l>
     <l n="56">Thy soul was breathed to Jesus , or explained</l>
     <l n="57">The words that lead unto eternal life .</l>
     <l n="58">From infancy thy heart was vow 'd to God :</l>
     <l n="59">And aye the hope that one day thou might'st keep</l>

     <l n="66">Thy life was ever such as well became</l>
     <l n="67">One whose pure soul was fixed upon the cross !</l>

     <l n="69">GRAHAME pled the poor man 's cause , the listner oft</l>

     <l n="77">Whose voice exhorted , and whose footsteps led</l>
     <l n="78">Unto the paths of life ; nor sweeter hope ,</l>

     <l n="176">Of God 's forgiving smile . Obscured and pale</l>
     <l n="177">Were then the plumes of prostrate seraphim ,</l>
     <l n="178">Then hush 'd the universe her sphere-born strain ,</l>
     <l n="179">When from his throne , Paternal Deity</l>
     <l n="180">Declared the Saviour not in vain had shed</l>
     <l n="181">His martyr 'd glory round the accursed cross ,</l>
     <l n="182">That fallen man might sit in Paradise ,</l>
     <l n="183">And earth to heaven ascend in jubilee .</l>
     <l n="184">O blessed day , by God and man beloved !</l>
     <l n="185">With more surpassing glory breaks thy dawn</l>
     <l n="186">Upon my soul , remembering the sweet hymns</l>
     <l n="187">That he , whom nations evermore shall name</l>
     <l n="188">The Sabbath-Bard , in gratulation high</l>
     <l n="189">Breathed forth to thee , as from the golden urn</l>
     <l n="190">That holds the incense of immortal song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="191">That Poem , so divinely melancholy</l>
     <l n="192">Throughout its reigning spirit , yet withal</l>
     <l n="193">Bathing in hues of winning gentleness</l>
     <l n="194">The pure religion that alone can save ,</l>
     <l n="195">Full many a wanderer to the paths of peace</l>
     <l n="196">Ere now hath made return , and he who framed</l>
     <l n="197">Its hallow 'd numbers , in the realms of bliss</l>
     <l n="198">Hath met and known the smiles of seraph-souls ,</l>
     <l n="199">By his delightful genius saved from death .</l>
     <l n="200">Oft when the soul is lost in thoughtless guilt ,</l>
     <l n="201">And seeming deaf unto the still small voice</l>
     <l n="202">Of conscience and of God , some simple phrase</l>
     <l n="203">Of beauty or sublimity will break</l>
     <l n="204">The spell that link 'd us to the bands of sin ,</l>
     <l n="205">And all at once , as waking from a dream ,</l>
     <l n="206">We shudder at the past , and bless the light</l>
     <l n="207">That breaks upon us like the new-born day .</l>
     <l n="208">Even so it fares with them , who to this world</l>
     <l n="209">Have yielded up their spirits , and , impure</l>
     <l n="210">In thought and act , have lived without a sense</l>
     <l n="211">Of God , who counts the beatings of their hearts .</l>
     <l n="212">But men there are of a sublimer mould ,</l>
     <l n="213">Who dedicate with no unworthy zeal</l>
     <l n="214">To human Science , up the toilsome steep</l>
     <l n="215">Where she in darkness dwells , with pilgrim-feet</l>
     <l n="216">By night and day unwearied strive to climb ,</l>
     <l n="217">Pride their conductor , glory their reward .</l>
     <l n="218">Too oft , alas ! even in the search of truth</l>
     <l n="219">They pass her on the way , although she speak</l>
     <l n="220">With loving voice , and cast on them her eyes</l>
     <l n="221">So beautifully innocent and pure .</l>
     <l n="222">To such , O GRAHAME ! thy voice cries from the tomb !</l>
     <l n="223">Thy worth they loved , thy talents they admired ,</l>
     <l n="224">And when they think how peaceful was thy life ,</l>
     <l n="225">Thy death far more than peaceful , though thou sought'st ,</l>
     <l n="226">Above all other knowledge , that of God</l>
     <l n="227">And his redeeming Son ; when o'er the page</l>
     <l n="228">Where thy mild soul for ever sits enshrined ,</l>
     <l n="229">They hang with soften 'd hearts , faith may descend</l>
     <l n="230">Upon them as they muse , or hope that leads</l>
     <l n="231">The way to faith , even as the morning-star</l>
     <l n="232">Shines brightly , heralding approaching day .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="233">But happier visions still now bless my soul .</l>
     <l n="234">While lonely wandering o'er the hills and dales</l>
     <l n="235">Of my dear native country , with such love</l>
     <l n="236">As they may guess , who , from their father 's home</l>
     <l n="237">Sojourning long and far , fall down and kiss</l>
     <l n="238">The grass and flowers of Scotland , in I go ,</l>
     <l n="239">Not doubting a warm welcome from the eyes</l>
     <l n="240">Of woman , man , and child , into a cot</l>
     <l n="241">Upon a green hill-side , and almost touch 'd</l>
     <l n="242">By its own nameless stream that bathes the roots</l>
     <l n="243">Of the old ash tree swinging o'er the roof .</l>
     <l n="244">Most pleasant , GRAHAME ! unto thine eye and heart</l>
     <l n="245">Such humble home ! there often hast thou sat</l>
     <l n="246">‘ Mid the glad family listening to thy voice</l>
     <l n="247">So silently , the ear might then have caught</l>
     <l n="248">Without the rustle of the falling leaf .</l>
     <l n="249">And who so sweetly ever sang as thou ,</l>
     <l n="250">The joys and sorrows of the poor man 's life .</l>
     <l n="251">Not fancifully drawn , that one might weep ,</l>
     <l n="252">Or smile , he knew not why , but with the hues</l>
     <l n="253">Of truth all brightly glistening , to the heart</l>
     <l n="254">Cheering , as earth 's soft verdure to the eye ,</l>
     <l n="255">Yet still and mournful as the evening light .</l>
     <l n="256">More powerful in the sanctity of death ,</l>
     <l n="257">There reigns thy spirit over those it loved !</l>
     <l n="258">Some chosen books by pious men composed ,</l>
     <l n="259">Kept from the dust , in every cottage lie</l>
     <l n="260">Through the wild loneliness of Scotia 's vales ,</l>
     <l n="261">Beside the Bible , by whose well-known truths</l>
     <l n="262">All human thoughts are by the peasant tried .</l>
     <l n="263">O blessed privilege of Nature 's Bard !</l>
     <l n="264">To cheer the house of virtuous poverty ,</l>
     <l n="265">With gleams of light more beautiful than oft</l>
     <l n="266">Play o'er the splendours of the palace wall .</l>
     <l n="267">Methinks I see a fair and lovely child</l>
     <l n="268">Sitting composed upon his mother 's knee ,</l>
     <l n="269">And reading with a low and lisping voice</l>
     <l n="270">Some passage from the Sabbath , while the tears</l>
     <l n="271">Stand in his little eyes so softly blue ,</l>
     <l n="272">Till , quite o'ercome with pity , his white arms</l>
     <l n="273">He twines around her neck , and hides his sighs</l>
     <l n="274">Most infantine , within her gladden 'd breast ,</l>
     <l n="275">Like a sweet lamb , half sportive , half afraid ,</l>
     <l n="276">Nestling one moment ‘ neath its bleating dam .</l>
     <l n="277">And now the happy mother kisses oft</l>
     <l n="278">The tender-hearted child , lays down the book ,</l>
     <l n="279">And asks him if he doth remember still</l>
     <l n="280">The stranger who once gave him , long ago ,</l>
     <l n="281">A parting kiss , and blest his laughing eyes !</l>
     <l n="282">His sobs speak fond remembrance , and he weeps</l>
     <l n="283">To think so kind and good a man should die .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="284">Though dead on earth , yet he from heaven looks down</l>
     <l n="285">On thee , sweet child ! and others pure like thee !</l>
     <l n="286">Made happier , though an angel , by the sight</l>
     <l n="287">Of happiness , and virtue by himself</l>
     <l n="288">Created or preserved ; and oft his soul</l>
     <l n="289">Leaves for a while her amaranthine bowers ,</l>
     <l n="290">And dimly hears the choral symphonies</l>
     <l n="291">Of spirits singing round the Saviour 's throne ,</l>
     <l n="292">Delighted with a glimpse of Scotland 's vales</l>
     <l n="293">Winding round hills where once his pious hymns</l>
     <l n="294">Were meditated in his silent heart ,</l>
     <l n="295">Or with those human beings here beloved ,</l>
     <l n="296">Whether they smile , as virtue ever smiles ,</l>
     <l n="297">With sunny countenance gentle and benign .</l>
     <l n="298">Or a slight shade of sadness seems to say ,</l>
     <l n="299">That they are thinking of the sainted soul</l>
     <l n="300">That looks from heaven on them !—</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="301">A holy creed</l>
     <l n="302">It is , and most delightful unto all</l>
     <l n="303">Who feel how deeply human sympathies</l>
     <l n="304">Blend with our hopes of heaven , which holds that death</l>
     <l n="305">Divideth not , as by a roaring sea ,</l>
     <l n="306">Departed spirits from this lower sphere .</l>
     <l n="307">How could the virtuous even in heaven be blest ,</l>
     <l n="308">Unless they saw the lovers and the friends ,</l>
     <l n="309">Whom soon they hope to greet ! A placid lake</l>
     <l n="310">Between Time floateth and Eternity ,</l>
     <l n="311">Across whose sleeping waters murmur oft</l>
     <l n="312">The voices of the immortal , hither brought</l>
     <l n="313">Soft as the thought of music in the soul .</l>
     <l n="314">Deep , deep the love we bear unto the dead !</l>
     <l n="315">The adoring reverence that we humbly pay</l>
     <l n="316">To one who is a spirit , still partakes</l>
     <l n="317">Of that affectionate tenderness we own 'd</l>
     <l n="318">Towards a being , once , perhaps , as frail</l>
     <l n="319">And human as ourselves , and in the shape</l>
     <l n="320">Celestial , and angelic lineaments ,</l>
     <l n="321">Shines a fair likeness of the form and face</l>
     <l n="322">That won in former days our earthly love .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="323">O GRAHAME ! even I in midnight dreams behold</l>
     <l n="324">Thy placid aspect , more serenely fair</l>
     <l n="325">Than the sweet moon that calms the autumnal heaven .</l>
     <l n="326">Thy voice steals , ‘ mid the pauses of the wind ,</l>
     <l n="327">Unto my listening soul more touchingly</l>
     <l n="328">Than the pathetic tones of airy harp</l>
     <l n="329">That sound at evening like a spirit 's song .</l>
     <l n="330">Yet , many are there dearer to thy shade ,</l>
     <l n="331">Yea , dearer far than I ; and when their tears</l>
     <l n="332">They dry at last ( and wisdom bids them weep ,</l>
     <l n="333">If long and oft , O sure not bitterly )</l>
     <l n="334">Then wilt thou stand before their raptured eyes</l>
     <l n="335">As beautiful as kneeling saint e'er deem 'd</l>
     <l n="336">In his bright cell Messiah 's vision 'd form .</l>
     <l n="337">I may not think upon her blissful dreams</l>
     <l n="338">Who bears thy name on earth , and in it feels</l>
     <l n="339">A Christian glory and a pious pride ,</l>
     <l n="340">That must illume the widow 's lonely path</l>
     <l n="341">With never dying sunshine .— To her soul</l>
     <l n="342">Soft sound the strains now flowing fast from mine !</l>
     <l n="343">And in those tranquil hours when she withdraws</l>
     <l n="344">From loftier consolations , may the tears ,</l>
     <l n="345">( For tears will fall , most idle though they be ,)</l>
     <l n="346">Now shed by me to her but little known ,</l>
     <l n="347">Yield comfort to her , as a certain pledge</l>
     <l n="348">That many a one , though silent and unseen ,</l>
     <l n="349">Thinks of her and the children at her knees ,</l>
     <l n="350">Blest for the father 's and the husband 's sake .</l>
