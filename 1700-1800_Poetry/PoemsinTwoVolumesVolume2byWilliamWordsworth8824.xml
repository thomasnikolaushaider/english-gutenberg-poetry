     <l n="1">ROB ROY 's GRAVE .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The History of Rob Roy is sufficiently known ; his Grave is near the head of Loch Ketterine , in one of those small Pin-fold-like Burial-grounds , of neglected and desolate appearance , which the Traveller meets with in the Highlands of Scotland .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">A famous Man is Robin Hood ,</l>
     <l n="2">The English Ballad-singer 's joy !</l>
     <l n="3">And Scotland has a Thief as good ,</l>
     <l n="4">An Outlaw of as daring mood ,</l>
     <l n="5">She has her brave ROB ROY !</l>
     <l n="6">Then clear the weeds from off his Grave ,</l>
     <l n="7">And let us chaunt a passing Stave</l>
     <l n="8">In honour of that Hero brave !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">Heaven gave Rob Roy a dauntless heart ,</l>
     <l n="10">And wondrous length and strength of arm : 10</l>
     <l n="11">Nor craved he more to quell his Foes ,</l>
     <l n="12">Or keep his Friends from harm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Yet was Rob Roy as wise as brave ;</l>
     <l n="14">Forgive me if the phrase be strong ;—</l>
     <l n="15">Poet worthy of Rob Roy</l>
     <l n="16">Must scorn a timid song .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="17">Say , then , that he was wise as brave ;</l>
     <l n="18">As wise in thought as bold in deed :</l>
     <l n="19">For in the principles of things</l>
     <l n="20">He sought his moral creed . 20</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="21">Said generous Rob , “ What need of Books ?</l>
     <l n="22">Burn all the Statutes and their shelves :</l>
     <l n="23">They stir us up against our Kind ;</l>
     <l n="24">And worse , against Ourselves . ”</l>

     <l n="28">In bitterness of soul . ”</l>

     <l n="29">“ And , puzzled , blinded thus , we lose</l>
     <l n="30">Distinctions that are plain and few : 30</l>
     <l n="31">These find I graven on my heart :</l>
     <l n="32">That tells me what to do . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="33">“ The Creatures see of flood and field ,</l>
     <l n="34">And those that travel on the wind !</l>

     <l n="36">In peace , and peace of mind . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="37">“ For why ?— because the good old Rule</l>
     <l n="38">Sufficeth them , the simple Plan ,</l>
     <l n="39">That they should take who have the power ,</l>
     <l n="40">And they should keep who can . ” 40</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="41">“ A lesson which is quickly learn 'd ,</l>
     <l n="42">A signal this which all can see !</l>
     <l n="43">Thus nothing here provokes the Strong</l>
     <l n="44">To wanton cruelty . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="45">“ All freakishness of mind is check 'd ;</l>
     <l n="46">He tam 'd , who foolishly aspires ;</l>
     <l n="47">While to the measure of his might</l>
     <l n="48">Each fashions his desires . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="49">“ All Kinds , and Creatures , stand and fall</l>
     <l n="50">By strength of prowess or of wit : 50</l>
     <l n="51">Tis God 's appointment who must sway ,</l>
     <l n="52">And who is to submit . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="53">“ Since then , ” said Robin , “ right is plain ,</l>
     <l n="54">And longest life is but a day ;</l>
     <l n="55">To have my ends , maintain my rights ,</l>

     <l n="61">So was it — would , at least , have been</l>

    <head>3 . STEPPING WESTWARD .</head>
    <head>While my Fellow-traveller and I were walking by the side of Loch Ketterine , one fine evening after sun-set , in our road to a Hut where in the course of our Tour we had been hospitably entertained some weeks before , we met , in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary region , two well dressed Women , one of whom said to us , by way of greeting , “ What you are stepping westward ? ”</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ What you are stepping westward ? ” — “ Yea . ”</l>
     <l n="2">— ‘ Twould be a wildish destiny ,</l>

     <l n="4">In a strange Land , and far from home ,</l>
     <l n="5">Were in this place the guests of Chance :</l>
     <l n="6">Yet who would stop , or fear to advance ,</l>
     <l n="7">Though home or shelter he had none ,</l>
     <l n="8">With such a Sky to lead him on ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="9">The dewy ground was dark and cold ;</l>
     <l n="10">Behind , all gloomy to behold ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">And stepping westward seem 'd to be</l>
     <l n="12">A kind of heavenly destiny ;</l>
     <l n="13">I liked the greeting ; ‘ twas a sound</l>
     <l n="14">Of something without place or bound ;</l>
     <l n="15">And seem 'd to give me spiritual right</l>
     <l n="16">To travel through that region bright .</l>

     <l n="17">The voice was soft , and she who spake</l>

     <l n="22">Was fixed upon the glowing sky ,</l>
     <l n="23">The echo of the voice enwrought</l>

    <p n="1">NOTE I .</p>
    <p n="2">PAGE 4 ( 177 ) ; line 2 .— “ And wondrous length and strength of arm . ” The people of the neighbourhood of Loch Ketterine , in order to prove the extraordinary length of their Hero 's arm , tell you that “ he could garter his Tartan Stockings below the knee when standing upright . ” According to their account he was a tremendous Swordsman ; after having sought all occasions of proving his prowess , he was never conquered but once , and this not till he was an Old Man .</p>
    <p n="3">NOTE II .</p>
    <p n="4">PAGE 11 ( 185 ) .— The solitary Reaper . This Poem was suggested by a beautiful sentence in a MS Tour in Scotland written by a Friend , the last line being taken from it verbatim .</p>
    <p n="5">NOTE III .</p>
    <p n="6">PAGE 65 ( 239 ) .— THE BLIND HIGHLAND BOY . The incident upon which this Poem is founded was related to me by an eye witness .</p>
    <p n="7">NOTE IV .</p>
    <p n="8">PAGE 106 ( 280 ) ; line 10 .— “ Seen the Seven Whistlers , &amp; c . ” Both these superstitions are prevalent in the midland Counties of England : that of “ Gabriel 's Hounds ” appears to be very general over Europe ; being the same as the one upon which the German Poet , Burger , has founded his Ballad of the Wild Huntsman .</p>
    <p n="9">NOTE V .</p>
    <p n="10">PAGE 128 ( 302 ) .— Song , at the Feast of Brougham Castle . Henry Lord Clifford , &amp; c. &amp; c ., who is the subject of this Poem , was the son of John , Lord Clifford , who was slain at Towton Field , which John , Lord Clifford , as is known to the Reader of English History , was the person who after the battle of Wakefield slew , in the pursuit , the young Earl of Rutland , Son of the Duke of York who had fallen in the battle , “ in part of revenge ” ( say the Authors of the History of Cumberland and Westmorland ) ; “ for the Earl 's Father had slain his . ” A deed which worthily blemished the author ( saith Speed ) ; But who , as he adds , “ dare promise any thing temperate of himself in the heat of martial fury ? chiefly , when it was resolved not to leave any branch of the York line standing ; for so one maketh this Lord to speak . ” This , no doubt , I would observe by the bye , was an action sufficiently in the vindictive spirit of the times , and yet not altogether so bad as represented ; for the Earl was no child , as some writers would have him , but able to bear arms , being sixteen or seventeen years of age , as is evident from this ( say the Memoirs of the Countess of Pembroke , who was laudably anxious to wipe away , as far as could be , this stigma from the illustrious name to which she was born ) ; that he was the next Child to King Edward the Fourth , which his mother had by Richard Duke of York , and that King was then eighteen years of age : and for the small distance betwixt her Children , see Austin Vincent in his book of Nobility , page 622 , where he writes of them all . It may further be observed , that Lord Clifford , who was then himself only twenty-five years of age , had been a leading Man and Commander , two or three years together in the Army of Lancaster , before this time ; and , therefore , would be less likely to think that the Earl of Rutland might be entitled to mercy from his youth .— But , independent of this act , at best a cruel and savage one , the Family of Clifford had done enough to draw upon them the vehement hatred of the House of York : so that after the Battle of Towton there was no hope for them but in flight and concealment . Henry , the subject of the Poem , was deprived of his estate and honours during the space of twenty-four years ; all which time he lived as a shepherd in Yorkshire , or in Cumberland , where the estate of his Father-in-law ( Sir Lancelot Threlkeld ) lay . He was restored to his estate and honours in the first year of Henry the Seventh . It is recorded that , “ when called to parliament , he behaved nobly and wisely ; but otherwise came seldom to London or the Court ; and rather delighted to live in the country , where he repaired several of his Castles , which had gone to decay during the late troubles . ” Thus far is chiefly collected from Nicholson and Burn ; and I can add , from my own knowledge , that there is a tradition current in the village of Threlkeld and its neighbourhood , his principal retreat , that , in the course of his shepherd life , he had acquired great astronomical knowledge . I cannot conclude this note without adding a word upon the subject of those numerous and noble feudal Edifices , spoken of in the Poem , the ruins of some of which are , at this day , so great an ornament to that interesting country . The Cliffords had always been distinguished for an honorable pride in these Castles ; and we have seen that after the wars of York and Lancaster they were rebuilt ; in the civil Wars of Charles the First , they were again laid waste , and again restored almost to their former magnificence by the celebrated Lady Anne Clifford , Countess of Pembroke , &amp; c. &amp; c. Not more than 25 years after this was done , when the Estates of Clifford had passed into the family of Tufton , three of these Castles , namely Brough , Brougham , and Pendragon , were demolished , and the timber and other materials sold by Thomas Earl of Thanet . We will hope that , when this order was issued , the Earl had not consulted the text of Isaiah , 58th Chap . 12th Verse , to which the inscription placed over the gate of Pendragon Castle , by the Countess of Pembroke ( I believe his Grandmother ) at the time she repaired that structure , refers the reader . “ And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places ; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations , and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach , the restorer of paths to dwell in . ” The Earl of Thanet , the present possessor of the Estates , with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors , and a proper sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity , has ( I am told ) given orders that they shall be preserved from all depredations .</p>
    <p n="11">NOTE VI .</p>
    <p n="12">PAGE 130 ( 304 ) ; line 2 .— “ Earth helped him with the cry of blood . ” This line is from The Battle of Bosworth Field by Sir John Beaumont ( Brother to the Dramatist ) , whose poems are written with so much spirit , elegance , and harmony , that it is supposed , as the Book is very scarce , a new edition of it would be acceptable to Scholars and Men of taste , and , accordingly , it is in contemplation to give one .</p>
    <p n="13">NOTE VII .</p>
    <p n="14">PAGE 135 ( 309 ) ; line 15 .—</p>
    <p n="15">“ And both the undying Fish that swim Through Bowscale-Tarn , ” &amp; c .</p>
    <p n="16">It is imagined by the people of the Country that there are two immortal Fish , Inhabitants of this Tarn , which lies in the mountains not far from Threlkeld .— Blencathara , mentioned before , is the old and proper name of the mountain vulgarly called Saddle-back .</p>
    <p n="17">NOTE VIII .</p>
    <p n="18">PAGE 136 ( 310 ) ; lines 17 and 18 .—</p>
    <p n="19">“ Armour rusting in his Halls On the blood of Clifford calls . ”</p>
    <p n="20">The martial character of the Cliffords is well known to the readers of English History ; but it may not be improper here to say , by way of comment on these lines and what follows , that , besides several others who perished in the same manner , the four immediate Progenitors of the person in whose hearing this is supposed to be spoken , all died in the Field .</p>
    <p n="21">NOTE IX .</p>
    <p n="22">PAGE 140 ( 314 ) .—</p>
    <p n="23">“ Importunate and heavy load ! ”</p>
    <p n="24">‘ Importuna e grave salma . ’ — MICHAEL ANGELO .</p>
