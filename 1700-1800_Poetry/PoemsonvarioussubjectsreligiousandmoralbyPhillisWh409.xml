    <head>P R E F A C E .</head>
     <l n="1">THE following POEMS were written originally for the Amusement of the</l>
     <l n="2">Author , as they were the Products of her leisure Moments . She had no</l>
     <l n="3">Intention ever to have published them ; nor would they now have made</l>
     <l n="4">their Appearance , but at the Importunity of many of her best , and most</l>
     <l n="5">generous Friends ; to whom she considers herself , as under the greatest</l>
     <l n="6">Obligations .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>As her Attempts in Poetry are now sent into the World , it is hoped the Critic will not severely censure their Defects ; and we presume they have too much Merit to be cast aside with Contempt , as worthless and trifling Effusions .</p>
   <p>As to the Disadvantages she has laboured under , with Regard to Learning , nothing needs to be offered , as her Master 's Letter in the following Page will sufficiently show the Difficulties in this Respect she had to encounter .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">With all their Imperfections , the Poems are now humbly submitted to the</l>
     <l n="2">Perusal of the Public .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">The following is a Copy of a LETTER sent by the Author 's Master to the</l>
     <l n="4">Publisher .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>PHILLIS was brought from Africa to America , in the Year 1761 , between seven and eight Years of Age . Without any Assistance from School Education , and by only what she was taught in the Family , she , in sixteen Months Time from her Arrival , attained the English language , to which she was an utter Stranger before , to such a degree , as to read any , the most difficult Parts of the Sacred Writings , to the great Astonishment of all who heard her .</p>
   <p>As to her WRITING , her own Curiosity led her to it ; and this she learnt in so short a Time , that in the Year 1765 , she wrote a Letter to the Rev . Mr. OCCOM , the Indian Minister , while in England .</p>
   <p>She has a great Inclination to learn the Latin Tongue , and has made some Progress in it . This Relation is given by her Master who bought her , and with whom she now lives .</p>

    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>AS it has been repeatedly suggested to the Publisher , by Persons , who have seen the Manuscript , that Numbers would be ready to suspect they were not really the Writings of PHILLIS , he has procured the following Attestation , from the most respectable Characters in Boston , that none might have the least Ground for disputing their Original .</p>
   <p>WE whose Names are under-written , do assure the World , that the POEMS specified in the following Page ,* were ( as we verily believe ) written by Phillis , a young Negro Girl , who was but a few Years since , brought an uncultivated Barbarian from Africa , and has ever since been , and now is , under the Disadvantage of serving as a Slave in a Family in this Town . She has been examined by some of the best Judges , and is thought qualified to write them .</p>

     <l n="2">MAECENAS , you , beneath the myrtle shade ,</l>
     <l n="3">Read o'er what poets sung , and shepherds play 'd .</l>
     <l n="4">What felt those poets but you feel the same ?</l>
     <l n="5">Does not your soul possess the sacred flame ?</l>
     <l n="6">Their noble strains your equal genius shares</l>
     <l n="7">In softer language , and diviner airs .</l>
     <l n="8">While Homer paints , lo ! circumfus 'd in air ,</l>
     <l n="9">Celestial Gods in mortal forms appear ;</l>
     <l n="10">Swift as they move hear each recess rebound ,</l>
     <l n="11">Heav'n quakes , earth trembles , and the shores resound .</l>
     <l n="12">Great Sire of verse , before my mortal eyes ,</l>
     <l n="13">The lightnings blaze across the vaulted skies ,</l>
     <l n="14">And , as the thunder shakes the heav'nly plains ,</l>
     <l n="15">A deep felt horror thrills through all my veins .</l>
     <l n="16">When gentler strains demand thy graceful song ,</l>
     <l n="17">The length'ning line moves languishing along .</l>
     <l n="18">When great Patroclus courts Achilles ’ aid ,</l>
     <l n="19">The grateful tribute of my tears is paid ;</l>
     <l n="20">Prone on the shore he feels the pangs of love ,</l>
     <l n="21">And stern Pelides tend'rest passions move .</l>
     <l n="22">Great Maro 's strain in heav'nly numbers flows ,</l>
     <l n="23">The Nine inspire , and all the bosom glows .</l>
     <l n="24">O could I rival thine and Virgil 's page ,</l>
     <l n="25">Or claim the Muses with the Mantuan Sage ;</l>
     <l n="26">Soon the same beauties should my mind adorn ,</l>
     <l n="27">And the same ardors in my soul should burn :</l>
     <l n="28">Then should my song in bolder notes arise ,</l>
     <l n="29">And all my numbers pleasingly surprise ;</l>
     <l n="30">But here I sit , and mourn a grov'ling mind ,</l>
     <l n="31">That fain would mount , and ride upon the wind .</l>
     <l n="32">Not you , my friend , these plaintive strains become ,</l>
     <l n="33">Not you , whose bosom is the Muses home ;</l>
     <l n="34">When they from tow'ring Helicon retire ,</l>
     <l n="35">They fan in you the bright immortal fire ,</l>
     <l n="36">But I less happy , cannot raise the song ,</l>
     <l n="37">The fault'ring music dies upon my tongue .</l>
     <l n="38">The happier Terence * all the choir inspir 'd ,</l>
     <l n="39">His soul replenish 'd , and his bosom fir 'd ;</l>
     <l n="40">But say , ye Muses , why this partial grace ,</l>
     <l n="41">To one alone of Afric 's sable race ;</l>
     <l n="42">From age to age transmitting thus his name</l>
     <l n="43">With the finest glory in the rolls of fame ?</l>
     <l n="44">Thy virtues , great Maecenas ! shall be sung</l>
     <l n="45">In praise of him , from whom those virtues sprung :</l>
     <l n="46">While blooming wreaths around thy temples spread ,</l>
     <l n="47">I 'll snatch a laurel from thine honour 'd head ,</l>
     <l n="48">While you indulgent smile upon the deed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="49">* He was an African by birth .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="50">As long as Thames in streams majestic flows ,</l>
     <l n="51">Or Naiads in their oozy beds repose</l>
     <l n="52">While Phoebus reigns above the starry train</l>
     <l n="53">While bright Aurora purples o'er the main ,</l>
     <l n="54">So long , great Sir , the muse thy praise shall sing ,</l>
     <l n="55">So long thy praise shal ’ make Parnassus ring :</l>
     <l n="56">Then grant , Maecenas , thy paternal rays ,</l>
     <l n="57">Hear me propitious , and defend my lays .</l>

     <l n="1">O Thou bright jewel in my aim I strive</l>
     <l n="2">To comprehend thee . Thine own words declare</l>
     <l n="3">Wisdom is higher than a fool can reach .</l>
     <l n="4">I cease to wonder , and no more attempt</l>
     <l n="5">Thine height t ’ explore , or fathom thy profound .</l>
     <l n="6">But , O my soul , sink not into despair ,</l>
     <l n="7">Virtue is near thee , and with gentle hand</l>
     <l n="8">Would now embrace thee , hovers o'er thine head .</l>
     <l n="9">Fain would the heav'nhYpppHeNborn soul with her converse ,</l>
     <l n="10">Then seek , then court her for her promis 'd bliss .</l>
     <l n="11">Auspicious queen , thine heav'nly pinions spread ,</l>
     <l n="12">And lead celestial Chastity along ;</l>
     <l n="13">Lo ! now her sacred retinue descends ,</l>
     <l n="14">Array 'd in glory from the orbs above .</l>
     <l n="15">Attend me , Virtue , thro ’ my youthful years !</l>
     <l n="16">O leave me not to the false joys of time !</l>
     <l n="17">But guide my steps to endless life and bliss .</l>
     <l n="18">Greatness , or Goodness , say what I shall call thee ,</l>
     <l n="19">To give me an higher appellation still ,</l>
     <l n="20">Teach me a better strain , a nobler lay ,</l>
     <l n="21">O thou , enthron 'd with Cherubs in the realms of day .</l>

     <l n="1">WHILE an intrinsic ardor prompts to write ,</l>
     <l n="2">The muses promise to assist my pen ;</l>
     <l n="3">‘ Twas not long since I left my native shore</l>

     <l n="14">Immense compassion in his bosom glows ;</l>
     <l n="15">He hears revilers , nor resents their scorn :</l>
     <l n="16">What matchless mercy in the Son of God !</l>
     <l n="17">When the whole human race by sin had fall'n ,</l>
     <l n="18">He deign 'd to die that they might rise again ,</l>

     <l n="24">Let sin , that baneful evil to the soul ,</l>
     <l n="25">By you be shun 'd , nor once remit your guard ;</l>
     <l n="26">Suppress the deadly serpent in its egg .</l>
     <l n="27">Ye blooming plants of human race divine ,</l>
     <l n="28">An Ethiop tells you ‘ tis your greatest foe ;</l>

     <l n="336">And plac 'd a mighty helmet on his head :</l>
     <l n="337">The coat , the sword , the helm he laid aside ,</l>
     <l n="338">Nor chose to venture with those arms untry 'd ,</l>
     <l n="339">Then took his staff , and to the neighb'ring brook</l>

     <l n="341">Mean time descended to Philistia 's son</l>
     <l n="342">A radiant cherub , and he thus begun :</l>
     <l n="343">“ Goliath , well thou know'st thou hast defy 'd</l>
     <l n="344">“ Yon Hebrew armies , and their God deny 'd :</l>
     <l n="345">“ Rebellious wretch ! audacious worm ! forbear ,</l>

     <l n="350">“ I come to tell thee thine approaching fate .</l>
     <l n="351">“ Regard my words . The Judge of all the gods ,</l>
     <l n="352">“ Beneath whose steps the tow'ring mountain nods ,</l>

     <l n="355">“ Thee too a well-aim 'd pebble shall destroy ,</l>
     <l n="356">“ And thou shalt perish by a beardless boy :</l>
     <l n="357">“ Such is the mandate from the realms above ,</l>
     <l n="358">“ And should I try the vengeance to remove ,</l>
     <l n="359">“ Myself a rebel to my king would prove .</l>
     <l n="360">“ Goliath say , shall grace to him be shown ,</l>
     <l n="361">“ Who dares heav'ns Monarch , and insults his throne ? ”</l>
     <l n="362">“ Your words are lost on me , ” the giant cries ,</l>
     <l n="363">While fear and wrath contended in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="364">When thus the messenger from heav'n replies :</l>
     <l n="365">“ Provoke no more Jehovah 's awful hand</l>
     <l n="366">“ To hurl its vengeance on thy guilty land :</l>
     <l n="367">“ He grasps the thunder , and , he wings the storm ,</l>
     <l n="368">“ Servants their sov'reign ' s orders to perform . ”</l>
     <l n="369">The angel spoke , and turn 'd his eyes away ,</l>
     <l n="370">Adding new radiance to the rising day .</l>
     <l n="371">Now David comes : the fatal stones demand</l>
     <l n="372">His left , the staff engag 'd his better hand :</l>
     <l n="373">The giant mov 'd , and from his tow'ring height</l>
     <l n="374">Survey 'd the stripling , and disdain 'd the fight ,</l>
     <l n="375">And thus began : “ Am I a dog with thee ?</l>
     <l n="376">“ Bring'st thou no armour , but a staff to me ?</l>
     <l n="377">“ The gods on thee their vollied curses pour ,</l>
     <l n="378">“ And beasts and birds of prey thy flesh devour . ”</l>
     <l n="379">David undaunted thus , “ Thy spear and shield</l>
     <l n="380">“ Shall no protection to thy body yield :</l>
     <l n="381">“ Jehovah 's name ——— no other arms I bear ,</l>
     <l n="382">“ I ask no other in this glorious war .</l>
     <l n="383">“ To-day the Lord of Hosts to me will give</l>
     <l n="384">“ Vict'ry , to-day thy doom thou shalt receive ;</l>
     <l n="385">“ The fate you threaten shall your own become ,</l>
     <l n="386">“ And beasts shall be your animated tomb ,</l>
     <l n="387">“ That all the earth 's inhabitants may know</l>
     <l n="388">“ That there 's a God , who governs all below :</l>
     <l n="389">“ This great assembly too shall witness stand ,</l>
     <l n="390">“ That needs nor sword , nor spear , th ’ Almighty 's</l>
     <l n="391">hand :</l>
     <l n="392">“ The battle his , the conquest he bestows ,</l>
     <l n="393">“ And to our pow'r consigns our hated foes . ”</l>
     <l n="394">Thus David spoke ; Goliath heard and came</l>
     <l n="395">To meet the hero in the field of fame .</l>
     <l n="396">Ah ! fatal meeting to thy troops and thee ,</l>
     <l n="397">But thou wast deaf to the divine decree ;</l>
     <l n="398">Young David meets thee , meets thee not in vain ;</l>
     <l n="399">‘ Tis thine to perish on th ’ ensanguin 'd plain .</l>
     <l n="400">And now the youth the forceful pebble slung</l>
     <l n="401">Philistia trembled as it whizz 'd along :</l>
     <l n="402">In his dread forehead , where the helmet ends ,</l>
     <l n="403">Just o'er the brows the well-aim 'd stone descends ,</l>
     <l n="404">It pierc 'd the skull , and shatter 'd all the brain ,</l>
     <l n="405">Prone on his face he tumbled to the plain :</l>
     <l n="406">Goliath 's fall no smaller terror yields</l>
     <l n="407">Than riving thunders in aerial fields :</l>
     <l n="408">The soul still ling'red in its lov 'd abode ,</l>
     <l n="409">Till conq'ring David o'er the giant strode :</l>
     <l n="410">Goliath 's sword then laid its master dead ,</l>
     <l n="411">And from the body hew 'd the ghastly head ;</l>
     <l n="412">The blood in gushing torrents drench 'd the plains ,</l>
     <l n="413">The soul found passage through the spouting veins .</l>
     <l n="414">And now aloud th ’ illustrious victor said ,</l>
     <l n="415">“ Where are your boastings now your champion 's</l>
     <l n="416">“ dead ? ”</l>
     <l n="417">Scarce had he spoke , when the Philistines fled :</l>
     <l n="418">But fled in vain ; the conqu'ror swift pursu 'd :</l>
     <l n="419">What scenes of slaughter ! and what seas of blood !</l>
     <l n="420">There Saul thy thousands grasp 'd th ’ impurpled sand</l>
     <l n="421">In pangs of death the conquest of thine hand ;</l>
     <l n="422">And David there were thy ten thousands laid :</l>
     <l n="423">Thus Israel 's damsels musically play 'd .</l>
     <l n="424">Near Gath and Edron many an hero lay ,</l>
     <l n="425">Breath 'd out their souls , and curs 'd the light of day :</l>
     <l n="426">Their fury , quench 'd by death , no longer burns ,</l>
     <l n="427">And David with Goliath 's head returns ,</l>
     <l n="428">To Salem brought , but in his tent he plac 'd</l>
     <l n="429">The load of armour which the giant grac 'd .</l>
     <l n="430">His monarch saw him coming from the war ,</l>
     <l n="431">And thus demanded of the son of Ner .</l>
     <l n="432">“ Say , who is this amazing youth ? ” he cry 'd ,</l>
     <l n="433">When thus the leader of the host reply 'd ;</l>
     <l n="434">“ As lives thy soul I know not whence he sprung ,</l>
     <l n="435">“ So great in prowess though in years so young : ”</l>
     <l n="436">“ Inquire whose son is he , ” the sov'reign said ,</l>
     <l n="437">“ Before whose conq'ring arm Philistia fled . ”</l>
     <l n="438">Before the king behold the stripling stand ,</l>
     <l n="439">Goliath 's head depending from his hand :</l>
     <l n="440">To him the king : “ Say of what martial line</l>
     <l n="441">“ Art thou , young hero , and what sire was thine ? ”</l>
     <l n="442">He humbly thus ; “ The son of Jesse I :</l>
     <l n="443">“ I came the glories of the field to try .</l>
     <l n="444">“ Small is my tribe , but valiant in the fight ;</l>
     <l n="445">“ Small is my city , but thy royal right . ”</l>
     <l n="446">“ Then take the promis 'd gifts , ” the monarch cry 'd ,</l>
     <l n="447">Conferring riches and the royal bride :</l>

     <l n="32">For favours past , great Sir , our thanks are due ,</l>
     <l n="33">And thee we ask thy favours to renew ,</l>
     <l n="34">Since in thy pow'r , as in thy will before ,</l>
     <l n="35">To sooth the griefs , which thou did'st once deplore .</l>
     <l n="36">May heav'nly grace the sacred sanction give</l>
     <l n="37">To all thy works , and thou for ever live</l>
     <l n="38">Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame ,</l>
     <l n="39">Though praise immortal crowns the patriot 's name ,</l>
     <l n="40">But to conduct to heav'ns refulgent fane ,</l>
     <l n="41">May fiery coursers sweep th ’ ethereal plain ,</l>
     <l n="42">And bear thee upwards to that blest abode ,</l>
     <l n="43">Where , like the prophet , thou shalt find thy God .</l>
