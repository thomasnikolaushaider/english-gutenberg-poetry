    <docTitle><titlePart>The Witch of Atlas by Percy Bysshe Shelley TO MARY ( ON HER OBJECTING TO THE FOLLOWING POEM , UPON THE SCORE OF ITS CONTAINING NO HUMAN INTEREST ) . 1 . How , my dear Mary ,— are you critic-bitten ( For vipers kill , though dead ) by some review , That you condemn these verses I have written , Because they tell no story , false or true ? What , though no mice are caught by a young kitten , 5 May it not leap and play as grown cats do , Till its claws come ? Prithee , for this one time , Content thee with a visionary rhyme . 2 . What hand would crush the silken-winged fly , The youngest of inconstant April 's minions , 10 Because it cannot climb the purest sky , Where the swan sings , amid the sun 's dominions ? Not thine . Thou knowest ‘ tis its doom to die , When Day shall hide within her twilight pinions The lucent eyes , and the eternal smile , 15 Serene as thine , which lent it life awhile . 3 . To thy fair feet a winged Vision came , Whose date should have been longer than a day , And o'er thy head did beat its wings for fame , And in thy sight its fading plumes display ; 20 The watery bow burned in the evening flame . But the shower fell , the swift Sun went his way — And that is dead .— O , let me not believe That anything of mine is fit to live ! 4 . Wordsworth informs us he was nineteen years 25 Considering and retouching Peter Bell ; Watering his laurels with the killing tears Of slow , dull care , so that their roots to Hell Might pierce , and their wide branches blot the spheres Of Heaven , with dewy leaves and flowers ; this well 30 May be , for Heaven and Earth conspire to foil The over-busy gardener 's blundering toil . 5 . My Witch indeed is not so sweet a creature As Ruth or Lucy , whom his graceful praise Clothes for our grandsons — but she matches Peter , 35 Though he took nineteen years , and she three days In dressing . Light the vest of flowing metre She wears ; he , proud as dandy with his stays , Has hung upon his wiry limbs a dress Like King Lear 's ‘ looped and windowed raggedness . ’ 40 6 . If you strip Peter , you will see a fellow Scorched by Hell 's hyperequatorial climate Into a kind of a sulphureous yellow : A lean mark , hardly fit to fling a rhyme at ; In shape a Scaramouch , in hue Othello . 45 If you unveil my Witch , no priest nor primate Can shrive you of that sin ,— if sin there be In love , when it becomes idolatry . THE WITCH OF ATLAS .</titlePart></docTitle>
