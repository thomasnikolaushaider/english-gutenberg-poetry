     <l n="2">Quantum scire licet . Venit aetas omnis in unam</l>
     <l n="3">Congeriem , miserumque premunt tot saecula pectus .</l>
     <l n="4">LUCAN , Phars . v. 176 .</l>

     <l n="5">How wonderful is Death ,</l>
     <l n="6">Death and his brother Sleep !</l>
     <l n="7">One pale as yonder wan and horned moon ,</l>
     <l n="8">With lips of lurid blue ,</l>
     <l n="9">The other glowing like the vital morn , 5</l>
     <l n="10">When throned on ocean 's wave</l>
     <l n="11">It breathes over the world :</l>
     <l n="12">Yet both so passing strange and wonderful !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="13">Hath then the iron-sceptred Skeleton ,</l>
     <l n="14">Whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres , 10</l>
     <l n="15">To the hell dogs that couch beneath his throne</l>
     <l n="16">Cast that fair prey ? Must that divinest form ,</l>
     <l n="17">Which love and admiration cannot view</l>
     <l n="18">Without a beating heart , whose azure veins</l>
     <l n="19">Steal like dark streams along a field of snow , 15</l>
     <l n="20">Whose outline is as fair as marble clothed</l>
     <l n="21">In light of some sublimest mind , decay ?</l>
     <l n="22">Nor putrefaction 's breath</l>
     <l n="23">Leave aught of this pure spectacle</l>
     <l n="24">But loathsomeness and ruin ?— 20</l>
     <l n="25">Spare aught but a dark theme ,</l>
     <l n="26">On which the lightest heart might moralize ?</l>
     <l n="27">Or is it but that downy-winged slumbers</l>
     <l n="28">Have charmed their nurse coy Silence near her lids</l>
     <l n="29">To watch their own repose ? 25</l>
     <l n="30">Will they , when morning 's beam</l>
     <l n="31">Flows through those wells of light ,</l>
     <l n="32">Seek far from noise and day some western cave ,</l>
     <l n="33">Where woods and streams with soft and pausing winds</l>
     <l n="34">A lulling murmur weave ?— 30</l>
     <l n="35">Ianthe doth not sleep</l>
     <l n="36">The dreamless sleep of death :</l>
     <l n="37">Nor in her moonlight chamber silently</l>
     <l n="38">Doth Henry hear her regular pulses throb ,</l>
     <l n="39">Or mark her delicate cheek 35</l>
     <l n="40">With interchange of hues mock the broad moon ,</l>
     <l n="41">Outwatching weary night ,</l>
     <l n="42">Without assured reward .</l>
     <l n="43">Her dewy eyes are closed ;</l>
     <l n="44">On their translucent lids , whose texture fine 40</l>
     <l n="45">Scarce hides the dark blue orbs that burn below</l>
     <l n="46">With unapparent fire ,</l>
     <l n="47">The baby Sleep is pillowed :</l>
     <l n="48">Her golden tresses shade</l>
     <l n="49">The bosom 's stainless pride , 45</l>
     <l n="50">Twining like tendrils of the parasite</l>
     <l n="51">Around a marble column .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="52">Hark ! whence that rushing sound ?</l>
     <l n="53">‘ Tis like a wondrous strain that sweeps</l>
     <l n="54">Around a lonely ruin 50</l>
     <l n="55">When west winds sigh and evening waves respond</l>
     <l n="56">In whispers from the shore :</l>
     <l n="57">‘ Tis wilder than the unmeasured notes</l>
     <l n="58">Which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves</l>
     <l n="59">The genii of the breezes sweep . 55</l>
     <l n="60">Floating on waves of music and of light ,</l>
     <l n="61">The chariot of the Daemon of the World</l>
     <l n="62">Descends in silent power :</l>
     <l n="63">Its shape reposed within : slight as some cloud</l>
     <l n="64">That catches but the palest tinge of day 60</l>
     <l n="65">When evening yields to night ,</l>
     <l n="66">Bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue</l>
     <l n="67">Its transitory robe .</l>
     <l n="68">Four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful</l>
     <l n="69">Draw that strange car of glory , reins of light 65</l>
     <l n="70">Check their unearthly speed ; they stop and fold</l>
     <l n="71">Their wings of braided air :</l>
     <l n="72">The Daemon leaning from the ethereal car</l>
     <l n="73">Gazed on the slumbering maid .</l>
     <l n="74">Human eye hath ne'er beheld 70</l>
     <l n="75">A shape so wild , so bright , so beautiful ,</l>
     <l n="76">As that which o'er the maiden 's charmed sleep</l>
     <l n="77">Waving a starry wand ,</l>
     <l n="78">Hung like a mist of light .</l>
     <l n="79">Such sounds as breathed around like odorous winds 75</l>
     <l n="80">Of wakening spring arose ,</l>
     <l n="81">Filling the chamber and the moonlight sky .</l>
     <l n="82">Maiden , the world 's supremest spirit</l>
     <l n="83">Beneath the shadow of her wings</l>
     <l n="84">Folds all thy memory doth inherit 80</l>
     <l n="85">From ruin of divinest things ,</l>
     <l n="86">Feelings that lure thee to betray ,</l>
     <l n="87">And light of thoughts that pass away .</l>
     <l n="88">For thou hast earned a mighty boon ,</l>
     <l n="89">The truths which wisest poets see 85</l>
     <l n="90">Dimly , thy mind may make its own ,</l>
     <l n="91">Rewarding its own majesty ,</l>
     <l n="92">Entranced in some diviner mood</l>
     <l n="93">Of self-oblivious solitude .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="94">Custom , and Faith , and Power thou spurnest ; 90</l>
     <l n="95">From hate and awe thy heart is free ;</l>
     <l n="96">Ardent and pure as day thou burnest ,</l>
     <l n="97">For dark and cold mortality</l>
     <l n="98">A living light , to cheer it long ,</l>
     <l n="99">The watch-fires of the world among . 95</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="100">Therefore from nature 's inner shrine ,</l>
     <l n="101">Where gods and fiends in worship bend ,</l>
     <l n="102">Majestic spirit , be it thine</l>
     <l n="103">The flame to seize , the veil to rend ,</l>
     <l n="104">Where the vast snake Eternity 100</l>
     <l n="105">In charmed sleep doth ever lie .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="106">All that inspires thy voice of love ,</l>
     <l n="107">Or speaks in thy unclosing eyes ,</l>
     <l n="108">Or through thy frame doth burn or move ,</l>
     <l n="109">Or think or feel , awake , arise ! 105</l>
     <l n="110">Spirit , leave for mine and me</l>
     <l n="111">Earth 's unsubstantial mimicry !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="112">It ceased , and from the mute and moveless frame</l>
     <l n="113">A radiant spirit arose ,</l>
     <l n="114">All beautiful in naked purity . 110</l>
     <l n="115">Robed in its human hues it did ascend ,</l>
     <l n="116">Disparting as it went the silver clouds ,</l>
     <l n="117">It moved towards the car , and took its seat</l>
     <l n="118">Beside the Daemon shape .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="119">Obedient to the sweep of aery song , 115</l>
     <l n="120">The mighty ministers</l>
     <l n="121">Unfurled their prismy wings .</l>
     <l n="122">The magic car moved on ;</l>
     <l n="123">The night was fair , innumerable stars</l>
     <l n="124">Studded heaven 's dark blue vault ; 120</l>
     <l n="125">The eastern wave grew pale</l>
     <l n="126">With the first smile of morn .</l>
     <l n="127">The magic car moved on .</l>
     <l n="128">From the swift sweep of wings</l>
     <l n="129">The atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew ; 125</l>
     <l n="130">And where the burning wheels</l>
     <l n="131">Eddied above the mountain 's loftiest peak</l>
     <l n="132">Was traced a line of lightning .</l>
     <l n="133">Now far above a rock the utmost verge</l>
     <l n="134">Of the wide earth it flew , 130</l>
     <l n="135">The rival of the Andes , whose dark brow</l>
     <l n="136">Frowned o'er the silver sea .</l>
     <l n="137">Far , far below the chariot 's stormy path ,</l>
     <l n="138">Calm as a slumbering babe ,</l>
     <l n="139">Tremendous ocean lay . 135</l>
     <l n="140">Its broad and silent mirror gave to view</l>
     <l n="141">The pale and waning stars ,</l>
     <l n="142">The chariot 's fiery track ,</l>
     <l n="143">And the grey light of morn</l>
     <l n="144">Tingeing those fleecy clouds 140</l>
     <l n="145">That cradled in their folds the infant dawn .</l>
     <l n="146">The chariot seemed to fly</l>
     <l n="147">Through the abyss of an immense concave ,</l>
     <l n="148">Radiant with million constellations , tinged</l>
     <l n="149">With shades of infinite colour , 145</l>
     <l n="150">And semicircled with a belt</l>
     <l n="151">Flashing incessant meteors .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="152">As they approached their goal ,</l>
     <l n="153">The winged shadows seemed to gather speed .</l>
     <l n="154">The sea no longer was distinguished ; earth 150</l>
     <l n="155">Appeared a vast and shadowy sphere , suspended</l>
     <l n="156">In the black concave of heaven</l>
     <l n="157">With the sun 's cloudless orb ,</l>
     <l n="158">Whose rays of rapid light</l>
     <l n="159">Parted around the chariot 's swifter course , 155</l>
     <l n="160">And fell like ocean 's feathery spray</l>
     <l n="161">Dashed from the boiling surge</l>
     <l n="162">Before a vessel 's prow .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="163">The magic car moved on .</l>
     <l n="164">Earth 's distant orb appeared 160</l>
     <l n="165">The smallest light that twinkles in the heavens ,</l>
     <l n="166">Whilst round the chariot 's way</l>
     <l n="167">Innumerable systems widely rolled ,</l>
     <l n="168">And countless spheres diffused</l>
     <l n="169">An ever varying glory . 165</l>
     <l n="170">It was a sight of wonder ! Some were horned ,</l>
     <l n="171">And like the moon 's argentine crescent hung</l>
     <l n="172">In the dark dome of heaven ; some did shed</l>
     <l n="173">A clear mild beam like Hesperus , while the sea</l>
     <l n="174">Yet glows with fading sunlight ; others dashed 170</l>
     <l n="175">Athwart the night with trains of bickering fire ,</l>
     <l n="176">Like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven ;</l>
     <l n="177">Some shone like stars , and as the chariot passed</l>
     <l n="178">Bedimmed all other light .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="179">Spirit of Nature ! here 175</l>
     <l n="180">In this interminable wilderness</l>
     <l n="181">Of worlds , at whose involved immensity</l>
     <l n="182">Even soaring fancy staggers ,</l>
     <l n="183">Here is thy fitting temple .</l>
     <l n="184">Yet not the lightest leaf 180</l>
     <l n="185">That quivers to the passing breeze</l>
     <l n="186">Is less instinct with thee ,—</l>
     <l n="187">Yet not the meanest worm .</l>
     <l n="188">That lurks in graves and fattens on the dead ,</l>
     <l n="189">Less shares thy eternal breath . 185</l>
     <l n="190">Spirit of Nature ! thou</l>
     <l n="191">Imperishable as this glorious scene ,</l>
     <l n="192">Here is thy fitting temple .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="193">If solitude hath ever led thy steps</l>
     <l n="194">To the shore of the immeasurable sea , 190</l>
     <l n="195">And thou hast lingered there</l>
     <l n="196">Until the sun 's broad orb</l>
     <l n="197">Seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean ,</l>
     <l n="198">Thou must have marked the braided webs of gold</l>
     <l n="199">That without motion hang 195</l>
     <l n="200">Over the sinking sphere :</l>
     <l n="201">Thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds ,</l>
     <l n="202">Edged with intolerable radiancy ,</l>
     <l n="203">Towering like rocks of jet</l>
     <l n="204">Above the burning deep : 200</l>
     <l n="205">And yet there is a moment</l>
     <l n="206">When the sun 's highest point</l>
     <l n="207">Peers like a star o'er ocean 's western edge ,</l>
     <l n="208">When those far clouds of feathery purple gleam</l>
     <l n="209">Like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea : 205</l>
     <l n="210">Then has thy rapt imagination soared</l>
     <l n="211">Where in the midst of all existing things</l>
     <l n="212">The temple of the mightiest Daemon stands .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="213">Yet not the golden islands</l>
     <l n="214">That gleam amid yon flood of purple light , 210</l>
     <l n="215">Nor the feathery curtains</l>
     <l n="216">That canopy the sun 's resplendent couch ,</l>
     <l n="217">Nor the burnished ocean waves</l>
     <l n="218">Paving that gorgeous dome ,</l>
     <l n="219">So fair , so wonderful a sight 215</l>
     <l n="220">As the eternal temple could afford .</l>
     <l n="221">The elements of all that human thought</l>
     <l n="222">Can frame of lovely or sublime , did join</l>
     <l n="223">To rear the fabric of the fane , nor aught</l>
     <l n="224">Of earth may image forth its majesty . 220</l>
     <l n="225">Yet likest evening 's vault that faery hall ,</l>
     <l n="226">As heaven low resting on the wave it spread</l>
     <l n="227">Its floors of flashing light ,</l>
     <l n="228">Its vast and azure dome ;</l>
     <l n="229">And on the verge of that obscure abyss 225</l>
     <l n="230">Where crystal battlements o'erhang the gulf</l>
     <l n="231">Of the dark world , ten thousand spheres diffuse</l>

     <l n="238">Beneath the azure canopy ,</l>
     <l n="239">With the ethereal footsteps trembled not ; 235</l>
     <l n="240">While slight and odorous mists</l>

     <l n="243">The Daemon and the Spirit</l>

     <l n="250">Eternal Nature 's law .</l>
     <l n="251">Above , below , around ,</l>

     <l n="260">Like animated frenzies , dimly moved</l>
     <l n="261">Shadows , and skeletons , and fiendly shapes ,</l>
     <l n="262">Thronging round human graves , and o'er the dead</l>

     <l n="264">In verse , such as malignant gods pronounce , 260</l>
     <l n="265">Blasting the hopes of men , when heaven and hell</l>
