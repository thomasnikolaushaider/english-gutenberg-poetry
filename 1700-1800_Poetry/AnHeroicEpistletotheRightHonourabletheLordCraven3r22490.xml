     <l n="2">Too long have Britain 's sons with proud disdain</l>
     <l n="3">Survey 'd the gay Patrician 's titled train ,</l>
     <l n="4">Their various merit scann 'd with eye severe ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nor learn 'd to know the peasant from the peer :</l>
     <l n="6">At length the Gothic ignorance is o'er ,</l>
     <l n="7">And vulgar brows shall scowl on LORDS no more ;</l>
     <l n="8">Commons shall shrink at each ennobled nod ,</l>
     <l n="9">And ev'ry lordling shine a demigod :</l>
     <l n="10">By CRAVEN taught , the humbler herd shall know ,</l>
     <l n="11">How high the Peerage , and themselves how low .</l>
     <l n="12">Illustrious Chief , your eloquence divine</l>
     <l n="13">Shall raise the whole right honourable line ;</l>
     <l n="14">All shall with joy your bright example view ,</l>
     <l n="15">And love the tribe that boasts a son like you ;</l>
     <l n="16">While Liberty shall lead you to her throne</l>
     <l n="17">With jocund hand , and claim you for her own .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="18">When warm in youth , on Isis ’ learned shore ,</l>
     <l n="19">You early listen 'd to her sacred lore ;</l>
     <l n="20">Abhorr 'd the dull confinement of the schools ,</l>
     <l n="21">Contemn 'd their statutes , and despis 'd their rules .</l>
     <l n="22">Ev'n when to burst their bonds your ardor fail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="23">And law , tyrannic law , at last prevail 'd ,</l>
     <l n="24">Tho ’ forc 'd a while to bend beneath the yoke ,</l>
     <l n="25">Its weight your dauntless spirit never broke ,</l>
     <l n="26">Still rankled in your breast the fatal wound ,</l>
     <l n="27">Tho ’ years had o'er it roll 'd their circling round ,</l>
     <l n="28">On [ A ] SCROPE , tho ’ late , you rear 'd your threat'ning arm ,</l>
     <l n="29">And shew 'd the will without the pow'r to harm .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="30">With Freedom 's warmth , tho ’ thus your bosom glow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">From no licentious heat the ardour flow 'd</l>
     <l n="32">When peaceful leaders rul 'd with gentle sway ,</l>
     <l n="33">Still were you first their mandates to obey ;</l>
     <l n="34">Tho ’ Proctors , arm 'd with all th ’ insulting pride</l>
     <l n="35">Of legal pow'r , your daring soul defy 'd ,</l>
     <l n="36">Yet to the ruler of the festive band</l>
     <l n="37">You bow 'd , nor scorn 'd the toast-master 's command ;</l>
     <l n="38">Obedient drank each penal draft of wine ,</l>
     <l n="39">And only fear 'd a salt and water fine .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="40">So burn 'd your youthful heart with Freedom 's flame ,</l>
     <l n="41">Such the fair dawning of your future fame ;</l>
     <l n="42">But when by time matur 'd , the Peerage spread</l>
     <l n="43">Its dazzling lustre round your honor 'd head ,</l>
     <l n="44">The sacred fire that warm 'd before your breast ,</l>
     <l n="45">Blaz 'd boldly forth to all mankind confess 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">Immortal Liberty with blooming charms ,</l>
     <l n="47">Woo 'd you so strongly to her heavenly arms ,</l>
     <l n="48">So fierce your passion , that you could not bear</l>
     <l n="49">Another vot'ry should her favors share ;</l>
     <l n="50">For still your heart Othello 's plan approves ,</l>
     <l n="51">Nor keeps a corner in the thing it loves</l>
     <l n="52">For others uses ; those who madly brave</l>
     <l n="53">Attack the rights you have , or think you have ,</l>
     <l n="54">Shall weep their rashness , that in luckless hour ,</l>
     <l n="55">Oppos 'd th ’ omnipotence of lordly pow'r .</l>
     <l n="56">When SEYMOUR insolently dar 'd invade ,</l>
     <l n="57">Manors by your possession sacred made ,</l>
     <l n="58">From feasts you deign 'd to grace , you wip 'd his name ,</l>
     <l n="59">And gave him o'er to infamy and shame :</l>
     <l n="60">And when , tho ’ late , he made a bold appeal</l>
     <l n="61">To arms , from frowning Peers and fawning zeal ,</l>
     <l n="62">And dar 'd attempt with sacrilegious sword ,</l>
     <l n="63">To offer equal combat to a LORD ,</l>
     <l n="64">Sudden your noble limbs your coursers bore ,</l>
     <l n="65">From Berkshire 's hills to Avon 's distant shore :</l>
     <l n="66">And eager to preserve from foul disgrace ,</l>
     <l n="67">Th ’ unsullied honors of a noble race ,</l>
     <l n="68">Rather than have it said you meanly stood</l>
     <l n="69">To stain your faulchion with Plebeian blood ,</l>
     <l n="70">You yielded bravely to a harsher fate ,</l>
     <l n="71">And made submissions to the man you hate .</l>
     <l n="72">To save their dignity from scandal 's breath ,</l>
     <l n="73">Thousands have fearless fac 'd approaching death ;</l>
     <l n="74">Your dauntless action merits more applause ,</l>
     <l n="75">Who courted infamy in honor 's cause .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="76">Proceed ! proceed ! and still our wond'ring eyes</l>
     <l n="77">With deeds magnanimous like these surprize ,</l>
     <l n="78">And lest some wretch , phlegmatic , dull , and cold ,</l>
     <l n="79">Without applause such actions should behold ,</l>
     <l n="80">Aloud to list'ning crowds your worth proclaim ,</l>
     <l n="81">Yourself the herald of your deathless fame .</l>
     <l n="82">To spacious Berks your dignity avow ,</l>
     <l n="83">From Buscot 's meads , to Windsor 's lofty brow ,</l>
     <l n="84">Till LOVEDEN 's daring insolence is o'er ,</l>
     <l n="85">And POWNEY cross your fav'rite schemes no more ;</l>
     <l n="86">Your sacred game , till lawless SEYMOUR spare ,</l>
     <l n="87">Nor hot-brain 'd PYE another challenge bear .</l>
     <l n="88">Shall humble Squires presume , by act or word ,</l>
     <l n="89">T ’ oppose the wishes of a mighty LORD ;</l>
     <l n="90">On high affairs attempt to give their voice ,</l>
     <l n="91">Or in elections e'er avow their choice ;</l>
     <l n="92">Pour in your rabble to each factious town ,</l>
     <l n="93">And Freedom 's sounds , by shouting numbers drown ,</l>
     <l n="94">Till Thames ’ unpeopled waves by READING glide ,</l>
     <l n="95">Without one bargeman left to chear the tide ;</l>
     <l n="96">And NEWBURY 's desart streets lament in vain ,</l>
     <l n="97">Their servile inmates gone to swell your train .</l>
     <l n="98">Stout FERDINANDO , your obsequious slave ,</l>
     <l n="99">Once a rude ruffian , now a pliant knave ,</l>
     <l n="100">With Stentor 's voice shall swell your pageant pride ,</l>
     <l n="101">And boldly thunder nonsense on your side :</l>
     <l n="102">The gentle Colonel , simpering SELLWOOD too ,</l>
     <l n="103">His face with port and patriot-ardor blue ,</l>
     <l n="104">With vacant eye shall view your great intent ,</l>
     <l n="105">Shall scratch his empty head , and smile assent .</l>
     <l n="106">There too my muse , with rough , tho ’ honest song ,</l>
     <l n="107">Shall chant your virtues to the admiring throng ,</l>
     <l n="108">Display your various worth in humble lays ,</l>
     <l n="109">And teach the gaping rabble how to praise ,</l>
     <l n="110">Re-echo to their ears your fav'rite word ,</l>
     <l n="111">And shew respect should always wait MY LORD .</l>
     <l n="112">Perhaps , ( indulge your Poet 's fairy dream ) ,</l>
     <l n="113">Perhaps my verse adorn 'd by such a theme ,</l>
     <l n="114">May in some bark , our navy sail t ’ explore ,</l>
     <l n="115">Be safely wafted to the Atlantic shore :</l>
     <l n="116">How will those pious Chiefs delight to hear</l>
     <l n="117">The kindred virtues of a British Peer ?</l>
     <l n="118">How will thy deeds enchant , with gentle sway ,</l>
     <l n="119">The Patriot sons of Massachuset 's Bay ?</l>
     <l n="120">For all your ardor fires the illustrious train ,</l>
     <l n="121">In Council bold , but bashful on the plain :</l>
     <l n="122">How will their grateful bosoms love the verse ,</l>
     <l n="123">Whose honest lines such great exploits rehearse ?</l>
     <l n="124">I see their hands prepare the verdant bough ,</l>
     <l n="125">I feel their laurel wreaths surround my brow ;</l>
     <l n="126">While that long-honour 'd strain , whose magic charms</l>
     <l n="127">So oft has called the gallant race to arms ,</l>
     <l n="128">Shall now at length give place to newer lays ,</l>
     <l n="129">And Yanky-doodle yield to CRAVEN 'S praise .</l>
