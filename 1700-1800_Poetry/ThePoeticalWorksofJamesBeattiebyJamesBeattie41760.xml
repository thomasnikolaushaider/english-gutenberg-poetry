   <p>The subject of this memoir was born on the 25th of October , 1735 , at Laurencekirk , in the county of Kincardine , Scotland . His father , James Beattie , who kept a small shop in the village at the same time that he rented a little farm in the neighbourhood , was a man of considerable talents and acquirements :[ A ] his mother , too , was distinguished for her abilities . Our author , James , was the youngest of the six children of this respectable pair .</p>
   <p>After his father 's decease , which happened when he was only seven years old , his mother , by means of the emoluments derived from the shop and the farm , was enabled to bring up her family in comfort . In the management of her affairs she was assisted by her eldest son , David , a youth of eighteen , who generously and affectionately relinquished all other pursuits for that of promoting her welfare and happiness , and who appears to have fostered his brothers and sisters with an almost parental care . James was placed at the parish school of Laurencekirk , which was then in some repute , and of which , about forty years before , Ruddiman , the famous grammarian , had been the master . At this time he had access to few books , except those which the minister of the village ( the Rev . Mr. Thomson ) kindly lent him , and which he read with avidity . It was then that he first became acquainted with English versification in Ogilby 's Virgil . Even then he was known among his schoolfellows by the name of the poet ; and sometimes he would rise from bed , during the night , that he might commit to writing any poetical idea that his fancy had happened to suggest .</p>
   <p>In 1749 he began his academical career , at the Marischal College , Aberdeen :[ B ] and as his circumstances were straitened , he became a competitor — and with success — for one of those bursaries or exhibitions , which are annually bestowed on students who are unable to support the entire expenses of a university education . He attended the Greek class taught by Dr. Blackwell . This scholar , whose writings on classical subjects , [ C ] though now fallen into disrepute , once enjoyed considerable popularity , soon discovered that his pupil was no ordinary young man , and distinguished him by several encouraging marks of approbation . The kindness of the Professor made a deep impression on the mind of Beattie , and he used to declare , in after life , that Blackwell was the first person who gave him reason to believe that he was possessed of any genius . During the four years of his attendance at the Marischal College he also studied philosophy and divinity . The last mentioned branch of knowledge he pursued doubtless with a view to the ministry , the church being then the chief resource of the well educated sons of the poorer classes in Scotland : he , however , soon abandoned all thoughts of the clerical profession .</p>
   <p>Having taken the degree of M. A ., he was elected , on the 1st of August , 1753 , schoolmaster of Fordoun , a small hamlet at the foot of the Grampian hills , about six miles distant from his birthplace : here also he officiated as praecentor , or parish-clerk .</p>
   <p>Many an hour was now spent by Beattie in perfect solitude ; the family of Mr. Forbes , the minister , being almost the only society , save the surrounding peasantry , which his situation allowed him to enjoy . But his days went happily by . When not occupied by his public duties , he appears to have devoted a portion of his time to the study of the classics ; [ D ] and occasionally he amused himself by composing little poems , a few of which were printed in the Scots Magazine . His fondness for music had ever been decided ; and in his present retirement he cultivated it with uncommon success . [ E ] In the grand and beautiful scenery of the neighbourhood he found a never-failing source of pleasure . Not far from the place where he dwelt , a large and well wooded glen communicates with the mountains . In it he loved to wander ; in it some of his earliest verses were written ; and his recollections of its wild and romantic charms may be traced in several vivid descriptions of nature in his poetical works . Sometimes he would pass the whole night among the fields , gazing on the sky , and observing the various aspects it assumed till the return of day ; and the exhilarating song of “ the lyric lark ” in the mornings of summer used to fill him with delight . In 1755 , his loneliness was cheered by the arrival of his brother David , who came to settle himself at the village of Fordoun .</p>
   <p>The celebrated and eccentric Francis Garden , Esq ., ( afterwards one of the judges of the supreme courts of civil and criminal law in Scotland , by the title of Lord Gardenstone ,) who was then sheriff of the county of Kincardine , and occasionally resided in the neighbourhood of Fordoun , was the earliest patron of our author . They accidentally became acquainted with each Other . Mr. Garden having one day discovered Beattie busily writing with a pencil in his favourite glen , and learning that he was engaged in the composition of a poem , [ F ] from that period took him under his protection .</p>
   <p>At this time too he became known to another more celebrated and more eccentric character , Lord Monboddo , whose family estate is in the parish of Fordoun ; and though their opinions on some important points by no means coincided , they ever after lived on friendly terms .</p>
   <p>In 1757 , the place of usher in the grammar-school of Aberdeen being vacant , Beattie , by the advice of Mr. Forbes , the minister of Fordoun , became a candidate for it , but without success . So conspicuously , however , had his abilities manifested themselves during his examination on that occasion , that the same place becoming again vacant about a year after , and two candidates having appeared , both of whom were declared unqualified for it , he was requested by the magistrates to fill it without further trial . He was accordingly elected to the office on the 20th June , 1758 .</p>
   <p>This was an important event in Beattie 's life . From a secluded hamlet , where there was the greatest difficulty in obtaining either society or books , he was transplanted to a populous and flourishing town , where he might associate with those whose tastes were congenial with his own , and carry on his literary pursuits by means of public libraries . The friend of his earlier years , Professor Blackwell , had sunk into the grave ; but he had soon the good fortune to become intimately acquainted with several persons of acknowledged talents and learning , connected with the Marischal and King 's Colleges , as also with various well educated gentlemen , inhabitants of the town .</p>
   <p>In 1760 , a chair in the Marischal College becoming vacant , it was suggested to Beattie by his friend , Mr. Arbuthnot , [ G ] that he should endeavour to procure the appointment for himself . Our author , who had never dreamed of aspiring to so dignified a situation , heard the proposal with astonishment . Mr. Arbuthnot , however , “ willing to try what could be done , ” induced the Earl of Erroll , with whom he was on intimate terms , to solicit , by means of Lord Milton , the powerful interest of the Duke of Argyll in behalf of the humble usher . The application proved successful ; and on the 8th October , 1760 , Beattie was installed Professor of Moral Philosophy and Logic in the Marischal College .</p>
   <p>His first lectures were delivered during the winter session of 1760 , and 1761 ; and for the long space of more than thirty years he continued to discharge most conscientiously the duties of the important station to which he had been so unexpectedly raised .</p>
   <p>A literary and convivial club ( to which the vulgar gave the nickname of the Wise Club ) had been established for some years at Aberdeen , the members consisting of the Professors of the Marischal and King 's Colleges , and of gentlemen of the town , who had a taste for literature and conversation . Into this society Beattie was now enrolled . They used to meet at a tavern , once a fortnight , at five o'clock in the afternoon , ( for in those days the common dinner-hour was early ) when , the president taking the chair , an essay was read , composed by one of the members in his turn , and a literary or philosophical subject discussed ; at half past eight a slight meal was served up , and at ten they retired to their homes . To this club Dr. Reid , Dr. Campbell , Dr. Gerrard , and Dr. Gregory , belonged ; and from it several admired works of philosophy and criticism may be said to have originated .</p>
   <p>In 1761 Beattie made his first appearance in print , in his own character , by publishing a small volume , dedicated to the Earl of Erroll , entitled Original Poems and Translations . It consisted partly of some of the verses which he had formerly sent to the Scots Magazine , and partly of pieces which he had recently composed . “ This collection , ” says his good-natured and not very tasteful biographer , Sir William Forbes , “ was very favourably received , and stamped Dr. Beattie with the character of a poet of great and original genius . ” It was certainly “ favourably received , ” the chief critical journals of the day being unanimous in its praise ; but that it “ stamped the author with the character of a poet of great and original genius , ” I cannot allow . The truth is , it does not contain a single poem which rises much above mediocrity ; and if Beattie had never touched the lyre with a more powerful hand , a memoir of his life would not have been required for the Aldine Poets . So lightly , indeed , did he himself afterwards think of the collection in question , that he used to destroy all the copies of it which he could procure , and would only suffer four pieces from it ( and these much altered and improved ) to stand in the same volume with The Minstrel .</p>
   <p>During the summer of 1763 , Beattie for the first time visited London , among the inhabitants of which , Millar , his publisher , was almost his only acquaintance . While residing there , he made a pilgrimage to Pope 's villa at Twickenham .</p>
   <p>The Judgment of Paris , printed in 4to , in 1765 , was the least successful of our author 's poetical works . Several passages of considerable beauty could not prevent this elaborate , cold , and metaphysical production from being utterly neglected by the public .</p>
   <p>That his Verses on the death of Churchill ( which appeared anonymously very soon after The Judgment of Paris ) were read with more attention , is to be attributed rather to the subject of the piece than to its intrinsic merit . [ H ] No one can peruse it without regretting that the amiable Beattie should have been betrayed by political feelings into such virulent abuse of a man of genius , who had just been gathered to the poets of other days . He is said to have written it at the solicitation of certain friends in Scotland , where the name of Churchill was held in detestation ; and on these injudicious instigators let a portion of the odium rest .</p>
   <p>In the autumn of 1765 , Gray , who was then regarded as the first of living bards , paid a visit to the Earl of Strathmore , at Glammis castle . No sooner did Beattie hear of his arrival than he addressed to him the following letter :</p>
   <p>Marischal College of Aberdeen , 30th August , 1765 .</p>
   <p>“ If I thought it necessary to offer an apology for venturing to address you in this abrupt manner , I should be very much at a loss how to begin . I might plead my admiration of your genius , and my attachment to your character ; but who is he that could not , with truth , urge the same excuse for intruding upon your retirement ? I might plead my earnest desire to be personally acquainted with a man whom I have so long and so passionately admired in his writings ; but thousands of greater consequence than I , are ambitious of the same honour . I , indeed , must either flatter myself that no apology is necessary , or otherwise I must despair of obtaining what has long been the object of my most ardent wishes ; I must forever forfeit all hopes of seeing you , and conversing with you .</p>
   <p>“ It was yesterday I received the agreeable news of your being in Scotland , and of your intending to visit some parts of it . Will you permit us to hope , that we shall have an opportunity , at Aberdeen , of thanking you in person , for the honour you have done to Britain , and to the poetic art , by your inestimable compositions , and of offering you all that we have that deserves your acceptance , namely , hearts full of esteem , respect , and affection ? If you cannot come so far northward , let me at least be acquainted with the place of your residence , and permitted to wait on you . Forgive , sir , this request ; forgive me if I urge it with earnestness , for indeed it concerns me nearly ; and do me the justice to believe , that I am , with the most sincere attachment , and most respectful esteem , &amp; c. &amp; c. &amp; c .</p>
   <p>“ P. S. Dr. Carlysle of Musselburgh , and Dr. Wight of Glasgow , acquainted me of your being in Scotland . It was from them I learned that my name was not wholly unknown to you . ”</p>
   <p>In consequence of this letter , Beattie received an invitation to Glammis castle ; and a friendship and correspondence commenced between the two poets , which terminated only with the death of Gray . The impression which their first meeting made on our author he thus describes in a letter to Sir William Forbes :— “ I am sorry you did not see Mr. Gray on his return ; you would have been much pleased with him . Setting aside his merit as a poet , which , however , in my opinion , is greater than any of his contemporaries can boast , in this or in any other nation , I found him possessed of the most exact taste , the soundest judgment , and the most extensive learning . He is happy in a singular facility of expression . His conversation abounds in original observations , delivered with no appearance of sententious formality , and seeming to arise spontaneously without study or premeditation . I passed two very agreeable days with him in Glammis , and found him as easy in his manners , and as communicative and frank , as I could have wished . ”</p>
   <p>A new edition of our author 's Poems came forth in 1766 . From it a large portion of the pieces published in the former collection was rejected ; while The Judgment of Paris , the Lines on the Death of Churchill , and one or two copies of verses never before printed , supplied the deficiency . The translation of Addison 's Pygmaeogeranomachia , which concludes the volume , is remarkable for its spirited and graceful versification .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In a letter to Dr. Blacklock , dated 22d September in the same year ,</l>
     <l n="2">Beattie thus alludes to his great work , The Minstrel :—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Not long ago I began a poem in the style and stanza of Spenser , in which I propose to give full scope to my inclination , and be either droll or pathetic , descriptive or sentimental , tender or satirical , as the humour strikes me ; for , if I mistake not , the manner which I have adopted admits equally of all these kinds of composition . I have written one hundred and fifty lines , and am surprised to find the structure of that complicated stanza so little troublesome . I was always fond of it , for I think it the most harmonious that ever was contrived . It admits of more variety of pauses than either the couplet or the alternate rhyme ; and it concludes with a pomp and majesty of sound , which , to my ear , is wonderfully delightful . It seems also very well adapted to the genius of our language , which , from its irregularity of inflexion and number of monosyllables , abounds in diversified terminations , and consequently renders our poetry susceptible of an endless variety of legitimate rhymes . But I am so far from intending this performance for the press , that I am morally certain it never will be finished . I shall add a stanza now and then , when I am at leisure , and when I have no humour for any other amusement ; but I am resolved to write no more poetry with a view to publication , till I see some dawnings of a poetical taste among the generality of readers , of which , however , there is not at present any thing like an appearance . ”</p>
   <p>Writing to Sir William Forbes , 8th January , 1767 , our author gives an account of the cause of his composing The Hermit , the most perfect of his minor poems :—</p>
   <p>“ The favourable reception you gave to my little poem , demands my acknowledgments . I aimed at simplicity in the expression , and something like uncommonness in the thought ; and I own I am not ill pleased with it upon the whole ; though I am sensible it does not answer the purpose for which I made it . I wrote it at the desire of a young lady of this country , who has a taste both for poetry and music , and wanted me to make words for a Scots tune called ‘ Pentland Hills , ’ of which she is very fond . The verses correspond well enough with the measure and subject of the tune , but are extremely unsuitable for the purpose of a song . "[ I ]</p>
   <p>To Dr. Blacklock he again writes concerning The Minstrel :</p>
   <p>“ Aberdeen , 20th May , 1767 .</p>
   <p>“ MY performance in Spenser 's stanza has not advanced a single line these many months . It is called ‘ The Minstrel . ’ The subject was suggested by a dissertation on the old minstrels , which is prefixed to a collection of Ballads lately published by Dodsley , in three volumes . I propose to give an account of the birth , education , and adventures of one of those bards ; in which I shall have full scope for description , sentiment , satire , and even a certain species of humour and of pathos , which , in the opinion of my great master are by no means inconsistent , as is evident from his works . My hero is to be born in the south of Scotland ; which you know was the native land of the English minstrels ; I mean of those minstrels who travelled into England , and supported themselves there by singing their ballads to the harp . His father is a shepherd . The son will have a natural taste for music and the beauties of nature ; which , however , languishes for want of culture , till in due time he meets with a hermit , who gives him some instruction ; but endeavours to check his genius for poetry and adventures , by representing the happiness of obscurity and solitude , and the bad reception which poetry has met with in almost every age . The poor swain acquiesces in this advice , and resolves to follow his father 's employment ; when , on a sudden , the country is invaded by the Danes , or English borderers , ( I know not which ,) and he is stript of all his little fortune , and obliged by necessity to commence minstrel . This is all that I have as yet concerted of the plan . I have written one hundred and fifty lines , but my hero is not yet born , though now in a fair way of being so , for his parents are described and married . I know not whether I shall ever proceed any farther : however , I am not dissatisfied with what I have written . ”</p>
   <p>On the 28th June , 1767 , Beattie was married at Aberdeen to Miss Mary Dun , only daughter of the rector of the Grammar-school in that city ; a mutual attachment having for some time existed between them . She was a few years younger than our author : her person was pleasing , her manners were lively ; and she possessed a moderate share of accomplishments . This union , which seemed to promise nothing but happiness to Beattie , threw the blight of misery over his later years , and undoubtedly contributed to shorten his career . The woman whom he had selected as a partner for life , inherited from her mother the most dreadful of human maladies ,— insanity ; which , a few years after marriage , displayed itself in strange follies and caprices , [ J ] and at last broke forth with such violence , as to render her separation from her family absolutely necessary . By this lady he had two sons , of whom particular mention will be made hereafter .</p>
   <p>Beattie now employed himself on the composition of his Essay on Truth , a work , which was to be honoured with such marks of public approbation , as the most sanguine author in his wildest dreams of success could hardly have anticipated . In a letter to Sir William Forbes , dated 17th January , 1768 , he says :—</p>
   <p>“ I have , for a time , laid aside my favourite studies , that I might have leisure to prosecute a philosophical inquiry , less amusing indeed than poetry and criticism , but not less important . The extraordinary success of the sceptical philosophy has long filled me with regret . I wish I could undeceive mankind in regard to this matter . Perhaps this wish is vain : but it can do no harm to make the trial . The point I am now labouring to prove , is the universality and immutability of moral sentiment ,— a point which has been brought into dispute , both by the friends and by the enemies of virtue . In an age less licentious in its principles , it would not , perhaps , be necessary to insist much on this point . At present it is very necessary . Philosophers have ascribed all religion to human policy . Nobody knows how soon they may ascribe all morality to the same origin ; and then the foundations of human society , as well as of human happiness , will be effectually undermined . To accomplish this end , Hobbes , Hume , Mandeville , and even Locke , have laboured ; and , I am sorry to say , from my knowledge of mankind , that their labour has not been altogether in vain . Not that the works of these philosophers are generally read , or even understood by the few who read them . It is not the mode , now-a-days , for a man to think for himself ; but they greedily adopt the conclusions , without any concern about the arguments or principles whence they proceed ; and they justify their own credulity by general declamations upon the transcendent merit of their favourite authors , and the universal deference that is paid to their genius and learning . If I can prove those authors guilty of gross misrepresentations of matters of fact , unacquainted with the human heart , ignorant even of their own principles , the dupes of verbal ambiguities , and the votaries of frivolous , though dangerous philosophy , I shall do some little service to the cause of truth ; and all this I will undertake to prove in many instances of high importance . ”</p>
   <p>During this year , a poem in broad Scotch , entitled The Fortunate Shepherdess , by Alexander Ross , schoolmaster , of Lochlee , was printed by subscription at Aberdeen ; and in order to excite some curiosity about the volume , Beattie good-naturedly wrote a copy of verses in the same dialect , addressed to the author , which appeared in the Aberdeen Journal . [ K ]</p>
   <p>He thus communicates to Dr. Blacklock his motives for attempting the laborious prose work , with which he was still occupied :—</p>
   <p>“ Aberdeen , 9th January , 1769 .</p>
   <p>“ It was very kind in you to read over my ‘ Essay on the Immutability of Moral Sentiment ’ with so much attention . I wish it deserved any part of the high encomium you bestowed on it . I flatter myself it will receive considerable improvements from a second transcribing , which I intend to begin as soon as I can . Some parts of it will be enlarged , and others ( perhaps ) shortened : the examples from history , and authorities from ancient authors , will be more numerous ; it will be regularly distributed into chapters and sections , and the language will be corrected throughout . The first part , which treats of the permanency of truth in general , is now in great forwardness ; ninety pages in quarto are finished , and materials provided for as many more . The design of the whole you will guess from the part you have seen . It is to overthrow scepticism , and establish conviction in its place ; a conviction not in the least favourable to bigotry or prejudice , far less to a persecuting spirit ; but such a conviction as produces firmness of mind , and stability of principle , in a consistence with moderation , candour , and liberal inquiry . If I understand my own design , it is certainly this ; whether I shall accomplish this design or not , the event only will determine . Meantime I go on with cheerfulness in this intricate and fatiguing study , because I would fain hope that it may do some good ; harm I think it cannot possibly do any .</p>
   <p>“ Perhaps you are anxious to know what first induced me to write on the subject ; I will tell you as briefly as I can . In my younger days I read chiefly for the sake of amusement , and I found myself best amused with the classics , and what we call the belles lettres . Metaphysics I disliked ; mathematics pleased me better ; but I found my mind neither improved nor gratified by that study . When Providence allotted me my present station , it became incumbent on me to read what had been written on the subject of morals and human nature ; the works of Locke , Berkeley , and Hume , were celebrated as masterpieces in this way ; to them , therefore , I had recourse . But , as I begin to study them with great prejudices in their favour , you will readily conceive how strangely I was surprised to find them , as I thought , replete with absurdities . I pondered these absurdities : I weighed the arguments , with which I was sometimes not a little confounded ; and the result was , that I began at last to suspect my own understanding , and to think that I had not capacity for such a study . For I could not conceive it possible , that the absurdities of these authors were so great as they seemed to me to be ; otherwise , thought I , the world would never admire them so much . About this time some excellent antisceptical works made their appearance , particularly Reid 's ‘ Inquiry into the Human Mind . ’ Then it was that I began to have a little more confidence in my own judgment , when I found it confirmed by those of whose abilities I did not entertain the least distrust . I reviewed my authors again , with a very different temper of mind . A very little truth will sometimes enlighten a vast extent of science . I found that the sceptical philosophy was not what the world imagined it to be , nor what I , following the opinion of the world , had hitherto imagined it to be , but a frivolous , though dangerous , system of verbal subtilty , which it required neither genius , nor learning , nor taste , nor knowledge of mankind , to be able to put together ; but only a captious temper , an irreligious spirit , a moderate command of words , and an extraordinary degree of vanity and presumption . You will easily perceive that I am speaking of this philosophy only in its most extravagant state , that is , as it appears in the works of Mr. Hume . The more I study it , the more am I confirmed in this opinion . But while I applauded and admired the sagacity of those who led me into , or at least encouraged me to proceed in , this train of thinking , I was not altogether satisfied with them in another respect . I could not approve that extraordinary adulation which some of them paid to their arch-adversary . I could not conceive the propriety of paying compliments to a man 's heart , at the very time one is proving that his aim is to subvert the principles of truth , virtue , and religion ; nor to his understanding , when we are charging him with publishing the grossest and most contemptible nonsense . I thought I then foresaw , what I have since found to happen , that this controversy will be looked upon rather as a trial of skill between two logicians , than as a disquisition in which the best interests of mankind were concerned ; and that the world , especially the fashionable part of it , would still be disposed to pay the greatest deference to the opinions of him who , even by the acknowledgment of his antagonists , was confessed to be the best philosopher and the soundest reasoner . All this has happened , and more . Some , to my certain knowledge , have said , that Mr. Hume and his adversaries did really act in concert , in order mutually to promote the sale of one another 's works ; as a proof of which , they mention , not only the extravagant compliments that pass between them , but also the circumstance of Dr. R. [ L ] and Dr. C. [ M ] sending their manuscripts to be perused and corrected by Mr. Hume before they gave them to the press . I , who know both the men , am very sensible of the gross falsehood of these reports . As to the affair of the manuscripts , it was , I am convinced , candour and modesty that induced them to it . But the world knows no such thing ; and , therefore , may be excused for mistaking the meaning of actions that have really an equivocal appearance . I know likewise that they are sincere , not only in the detestation they express for Mr. Hume 's irreligious tenets , but also in the compliments they have paid to his talents ; for they both look upon him as an extraordinary genius ; a point in which I cannot agree with them . But while I thus vindicate them from imputations , which the world , from its ignorance of circumstances , has laid to their charge , I cannot approve them in every thing ; I wish they had carried their researches a little farther , and expressed themselves with a little more firmness and spirit . For well I know , that their works , for want of this , will never produce that effect which ( if all mankind were cool metaphysical reasoners ) might be expected from them . There is another thing in which my judgment differs considerably from that of the gentlemen just mentioned . They have great metaphysical abilities , and they love the metaphysical sciences . I do not . I am convinced that this metaphysical spirit is the bane of true learning , true taste , and true science ; that to it we owe all this modern scepticism and atheism ; that it has a bad effect upon the human faculties , and tends not a little to sour the temper , to subvert good principles , and to disqualify men for the business of life . You will now see wherein my views differ from those of the other answerers of Mr. Hume . I want to show the world , that the sceptical philosophy is contradictory to itself , and destructive of genuine philosophy , as well as of religion and virtue ; that it is in its own nature so paltry a thing ( however it may have been celebrated by some ,) that to be despised it needs only to be known ; that no degree of genius is necessary to qualify a man for making a figure in this pretended science ; but rather a certain minuteness and suspiciousness of mind , and want of sensibility , the very reverse of true intellectual excellence ; that metaphysics cannot possibly do any good , but may do , and actually have done , much harm ; that sceptical philosophers , whatever they may pretend , are the corrupters of science , the pests of society , and the enemies of mankind . I want to show , that the same method of reasoning , which these people have adopted in their books , if transferred into common life , would show them to be destitute of common sense ; that true philosophers follow a different method of reasoning : and that , without following a different method , no truth can be discovered . I want to lay before the public , in as strong a light as possible , the following dilemma : our sceptics either believe the doctrines they publish , or they do not believe them : if they believe them , they are fools — if not , they are a thousand times worse . I want also to fortify the mind against the sceptical poison , and to propose certain criteria of moral truth , by which some of the most dangerous sceptical errors may be detected and guarded against .</p>
   <p>“ You are sensible , that , in order to attain these ends , it is absolutely necessary for me to use great plainness of speech . My expressions must not be so tame as to seem to imply either a diffidence in my principles , or a coldness towards the cause I have undertaken to defend . And where is the man who can blame me for speaking from the heart , and therefore speaking with warmth , when I appear in the cause of truth , religion , virtue , and mankind ? I am sure my dear friend Dr. Blacklock will not ; he , who has set before me so many examples of this laudable ardour ; he , whose style I should be proud to take for my model , if I were not aware of the difficulty , I may say , the insuperable difficulty , of imitating it with success . You need not fear , however , that I expose myself by an excess of passion or petulance . I hope I shall be animated , without losing my temper , and keen , without injury to good manners . In a word , I will be as soft and delicate as the subject and my conscience will allow . One gentleman , a friend of yours , [ N ] I shall have occasion to treat with much freedom . I have heard of his virtues . I know he has many virtues ; God forbid I should ever seek to lessen them , or wish them to be found insincere . I hope they are sincere , and that they will increase in number and merit every day . To his virtues I shall do justice ; but I must also do justice to his faults , at least to those faults which are public , and which , for the sake of truth and of mankind , ought not to be concealed or disguised . Personal reflections will be carefully avoided ; I hope I am in no danger of falling into them , for I bear no personal animosity against any man whatsoever : sometimes I may perhaps be keen ; but I trust I shall never depart from the Christian and philosophic character .</p>
   <p>“ A scheme like this of mine cannot be popular , far less can it be lucrative . It will raise me enemies ; it will expose me to the scrutiny of the most rigid criticism ; it will make me be considered by many as a sullen and illiberal bigot . I trust , however , in Providence , and in the goodness of my cause , that my attempts in behalf of truth shall not be altogether ineffectual , and that my labours shall be attended with some utility to my fellow-creatures . This , in my estimation , will do much more than counterbalance all the inconveniences I have any reason to apprehend . I have already fallen on evil tongues ( as Milton says ) on account of this intended publication . It has been reported , that I had written a most scurrilous paper against Mr. Hume , and was preparing to publish it when a friend of mine interposed , and , with very great difficulty , prevailed on me to suppress it , because he knew it would hurt or ruin my character . Such is the treatment I have to expect from one set of people . I was so provoked when I first heard this calumny that I deliberated whether I should not throw my papers into the fire , with a Si populus vult decipi , decipiatur : but I rejected that thought ; for so many persons have told me , that it was my duty to publish these papers , that I almost began to think so myself . Many have urged me to publish them ; none ever dissuaded me . The gentleman , named in the report , read the essay , and returned it with the highest commendations ; but I do not recollect that he ever spoke a syllable about publishing or suppressing it . But I have certainly tired you with so long a detail , about so trifling a matter as my works . However , I thought it necessary to say something by way of apology for them , for I find that your good opinion is of too much consequence to my peace , to suffer me to neglect any opportunity of cultivating it . ”</p>
   <p>The Essay on Truth being now finished , our author was desirous of selling the MS. to some bookseller , in order that he might avoid all risk to himself in the publication , and intrusted the care of this matter to Sir William Forbes and Mr. Arbuthnot . His two friends , however , having applied to the bookseller , whom they imagined the most proper person to publish the work , were vexed by his positive refusal to purchase it , although he had no objection to print it on Beattie 's account . In this difficulty they generously resolved to become themselves the purchasers of the first edition . “ I therefore , ” says Sir William Forbes , “ wrote to him [ Beattie ] ( nothing surely but the truth , although , I confess , not the whole truth ,) that the manuscript was sold for fifty guineas , which I remitted to him by a bank bill ; and I added , that we had stipulated with the bookseller who was to print the book , that we should be partners in the publication . ”</p>
   <p>At length in May , 1770 , the Essay on Truth was given to the world . As it had been seen in manuscript by several eminent literary characters , and as it was understood to be a direct attack on the philosophy of Hume ( who was then in the height of his popularity ,) its appearance excited immediate notice . It has been said , that on its publication , Hume spoke of Beattie with great bitterness , complaining ( and I am forced to allow that there was some cause for the complaint ) that he had not used him like a gentleman : it has even been asserted that he could not endure the name of our author to be mentioned in his presence . I suspect that in all this there is great exaggeration . The placid temper of Hume was not likely to be much ruffled by any thing that might be written against his system ; his friends and admirers were probably more disturbed by the attack than the philosopher himself . In less than four years five large editions of the Essay were circulated , and translations of it were made into French and other foreign languages .</p>
   <p>From the rugged paths of philosophy Beattie turned once more into the flowery walks of poesy . In 1771 , the First Book of The Minstrel was published without the author 's name . Its success was complete . The voice of every critic was loud in its praise ; and before the Second Book appeared ( in 1774 ) , four editions of the First had been dispersed throughout the kingdom . The following elegant and touching encomium was passed upon the poem by Lord Lyttelton , in a letter to Mrs. Montagu , who had put the First Book into the hands of that virtuous nobleman :</p>
   <p>“ Hill Street , 8th March , 1771 .</p>
   <p>“ I read your ‘ Minstrel ’ last night , with as much rapture as poetry , in her noblest , sweetest charms , ever raised in my soul . It seemed to me that my once most beloved minstrel , Thomson , was come down from heaven , refined by the converse of purer spirits than those he lived with here , to let me hear him sing again the beauties of nature , and the finest feelings of virtue , not with human , but with angelic strains ! I beg you to express my gratitude to the poet for the pleasure he has given me . ”</p>
   <p>Of the same date with the preceding letter , Beattie received one from Gray , containing many minute remarks on his poem . As it consists almost entirely of verbal criticism , it scarcely admits of quotation : a single short extract may however be given from it :</p>
   <p>“ St. 11 . O , how canst thou renounce , [ O ] &amp; c. But this , of all others , is my favourite stanza . It is true poetry ; it is inspiration ; only ( to show it is mortal ) there is one blemish ; the word garniture suggesting an idea of dress , and , what is worse , of French dress . ”</p>
   <p>When the poem was reprinted , one or two slight alterations were made in deference to the opinion of Gray .</p>
   <p>In a letter to the Dowager Lady Forbes , 12th October , 1772 , our author confesses that in the character of Edwin he meant to paint himself :</p>
   <p>“ From the questions your Ladyship is pleased to propose in the conclusion of your letter , as well as from some things I have had the honour to hear you advance in conversation , I find you are willing to suppose that , in Edwin , I have given only a picture of myself , as I was in my younger days . I confess the supposition is not groundless . I have made him take pleasure in the scenes in which I took pleasure , and entertain sentiments similar to those of which , even in my early youth , I had repeated experience . The scenery of a mountainous country , the ocean , the sky , thoughtfulness and retirement , and sometimes melancholy objects and ideas , had charms in my eyes , even when I was a schoolboy : and at a time when I was so far from being able to express , that I did not understand my own feelings , or perceive the tendency of such pursuits and amusements ; and as to poetry and music , before I was ten years old I could play a little on the violin , and was as much master of Homer and Virgil as Pope 's and Dryden 's translations could make me . ”</p>
   <p>The intense thought which Beattie had devoted to the composition of the Essay on Truth having materially injured his health , he was advised by his physicians to try the remedy of change of scene . He accordingly set out on a journey to London , and arrived there in the beginning of autumn , 1771 . He was no longer the obscure individual who had visited it in 1763 ; [ P ] he was now the triumphant adversary of scepticism , and the author of the admired Minstrel ; a man whom the most distinguished characters in the literary and fashionable world were prepared to treat with attention and respect . Among several letters of introduction , which he carried with him , was one from Dr. Gregory , of Edinburgh , to Mrs. Montagu . At the splendid and hospitable mansion of this celebrated lady , Beattie became acquainted with various persons , both male and female , who were then the chief ornaments of London society ; and he used to dwell with delight on the recollections of her more private parties , made up of Lord Lyttelton , Mrs. Carter , and a few others , who spent their evenings in the most unreserved conversation on literary , moral , or religious subjects . From this time , Mrs. Montagu continued to be one of his firmest friends ; and their epistolary correspondence closed only with her life . The politeness and kindness of Hawkesworth , Armstrong , Garrick , and Johnson , also contributed much to render pleasant his visit to the metropolis . Concerning the last illustrious man he writes thus : “ Johnson has been greatly misrepresented . I have passed several entire days with him , and found him extremely agreeable . The compliments he pays to my writings are so high that I have not the face to mention them . ” In December Beattie had returned to Aberdeen .</p>
   <p>In 1772 , his mother died , at the advanced age of fourscore , at the house of her affectionate son David , in the neighbourhood of Laurencekirk .</p>
   <p>Towards the end of April , 1773 , Beattie , accompanied by his wife , set out again for London . This journey was undertaken partly for the sake of his health and partly with a view to another object — the bettering of his circumstances . The emolument which he had derived from his writings bore unfortunately no proportion to the fame he had acquired ; and the small income arising from his professorship afforded him the only means for supporting his family . During his former visit to the capital , in 1771 , his English friends had been very desirous to procure for him some permanent provision ; and it was well known that his Majesty had expressed approbation of his writings , and had even declared his intention of conferring some reward on the man who had laboured so successfully to advance the interests of religion . With several important letters of introduction — one addressed to the Earl of Dartmouth — he now arrived in London , and was cordially welcomed by Mrs. Montagu , and his other friends . His reception by Lord Dartmouth was kind and courteous : soon after which , being summoned to wait on Lord North , he was told by that minister that an early opportunity should be taken to inform his Majesty of his arrival .</p>
   <p>By some of his friends it had been suggested that Beattie should take orders , and enter the English church ; but this mode of improving his fortunes he very properly rejected . [ Q ] At last , by the advice of the Archbishop of York , a memorial was drawn up “ expressing his services , his wants , and his wishes ; ” which , having been transmitted to Lord Dartmouth , was by him laid before the King , who , on that occasion , spoke of Beattie and his writings with high approbation , and signified a desire to see him .</p>
   <p>Meantime the number of our author 's acquaintances in the metropolis increased daily , and his society was eagerly courted by a long list of illustrious names . He now became personally known to a distinguished churchman , with whom , during the preceding year he had held some correspondence by letter — Dr. Porteus , then Rector of Lambeth , and finally Bishop of London ; and the friendship which took place between them was sincere and lasting .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">At the first levee , Beattie was presented by Lord Dartmouth to his</l>
     <l n="2">Majesty , who for several minutes talked to him concerning his Essay on</l>
     <l n="3">Truth in the most condescending and affable manner .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Soon after this , the University of Oxford , at the installation of Lord North as its Chancellor , conferred on our author a very flattering mark of distinction , an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws .</p>
   <p>At length the object of his wishes was attained . On the 20th of August , he received an official letter from the secretary of Lord North , informing him that the king had been pleased to allow him a pension of two hundred pounds a year . Of the private interview , with which , a few days after he was honoured by their majesties , he has left the following account in his Diary :</p>
   <p>“ Tuesday , 24th August , set out for Dr. Majendie 's at Kew-Green . The Doctor told me that he had not seen the King yesterday , but had left a note in writing , to intimate that I was to be at his house to-day ; and that one of the King 's pages had come to him this morning , to say ‘ that his Majesty would see me a little after twelve . ’ At twelve , the Doctor and I went to the King 's house , at Kew . We had been only a few minutes in the hall , when the King and Queen came in from an airing ; and , as they passed through the hall , the King called to me by name , and asked how long it was since I came from town . I answered , about an hour . ‘ I shall see you , ’ says he , ‘ in a little . ’ The Doctor and I waited a considerable time ( for the King was busy ) , and then we were called into a large room , furnished as a library , where the King was walking about , and the Queen sitting in a chair . We were received in the most gracious manner possible by both their Majesties . I had the honour of a conversation with them ( nobody else being present but Dr. Majendie ) for upwards of an hour , on a great variety of topics ; in which both the King and Queen joined , with a degree of cheerfulness , affability , and ease , that was to me surprising , and soon dissipated the embarrassment which I felt at the beginning of the conference . They both complimented me , in the highest terms , on my ‘ Essay , ’ which , they said , was a book they always kept by them ; and the King said he had one copy of it at Kew , and another in town , and immediately went and took it down from a shelf . I found it was the second edition . ‘ I never stole a book but one , ’ said his Majesty , ‘ and that was yours ( speaking to me ) ; I stole it from the Queen , to give it to Lord Hertford to read . ’ He had heard that the sale of Hume 's ‘ Essays ’ had failed , since my book was published ; and I told him what Mr. Strahan had told me , in regard to that matter . He had even heard of my being in Edinburgh last summer , and how Mr. Hume was offended on the score of my book . He asked many questions about the second part of the ‘ Essay , ’ and when it would be ready for the press . I gave him , in a short speech , an account of the plan of it ; and said , my health was so precarious , I could not tell when it might be ready , as I had many books to consult before I could finish it ; but , that if my health were good , I thought I might bring it to a conclusion in two or three years . He asked , how long I had been in composing my Essay ? praised the caution with which it was written ; and said , he did not wonder that it had employed me five or six years . He asked about my poems . I said , there was only one poem of my own on which I set any value ( meaning the ‘ Minstrel , ’ ) and that it was first published about the same time with the ‘ Essay . ’ My other poems , I said , were incorrect , being but juvenile pieces , and of little consequence , even in my own opinion . We had much conversation on moral subjects ; from which both their Majesties let it appear that they were warm friends to Christianity ; and so little inclined to infidelity , that they could hardly believe that any thinking man could really be an atheist , unless he could bring himself to believe that he made himself ; a thought which pleased the King exceedingly ; and he repeated it several times to the Queen . He asked , whether any thing had been written against me . I spoke of the late pamphlet , of which I gave an account , telling him , that I never had met with any man who had read it , except one Quaker . This brought on some discourse about the Quakers , whose moderation and mild behaviour the King and Queen commended . I was asked many questions about the Scots universities ; the revenues of the Scots clergy ; their mode of praying and preaching ; the medical college of Edinburgh ; Dr. Gregory ( of whom I gave a particular character ) , and Dr. Cullen ; the length of our vacation at Aberdeen , and the closeness of our attendance during the winter ; the number of students that attend my lectures ; my mode of lecturing , whether from notes , or completely written lectures ; about Mr. Hume , and Dr. Robertson , and Lord Kinnoull , and the Archbishop of York , &amp; c. &amp; c. &amp; c. His Majesty asked what I thought of my new acquaintance , Lord Dartmouth ? I said there was something in his air and manner which I thought not only agreeable , but enchanting , and that he seemed to me to be one of the best of men ; a sentiment in which both their Majesties heartily joined . ‘ They say that Lord Dartmouth is an enthusiast , ’ said the King , ‘ but surely he says nothing on the subject of religion , but what every Christian may , and ought to say . ’ He asked , whether I did not think the English language on the decline at present ? I answered in the affirmative ; and the King agreed , and named the ‘ Spectator ’ as one of the best standards of the language . When I told him that the Scots clergy sometimes prayed a quarter , or even half an hour at a time , he asked whether that did not lead them into repetitions ? I said , it often did . ‘ That , ’ said he , ‘ I do n't like in prayers ; and excellent as our liturgy is , I think it somewhat faulty in that respect . ’ ‘ Your majesty knows , ’ said I , ‘ that three services are joined in one in the ordinary church service , which is one cause of those repetitions . ’ ‘ True , ’ he replied , ‘ and that circumstance also makes the service too long . ’ From this he took occasion to speak of the composition of the church liturgy ; on which he very justly bestowed the highest commendation . ‘ Observe , ’ his Majesty said , ‘ how flat those occasional prayers are , that are now composed , in comparison with the old ones . ’ When I mentioned the smallness of the church livings in Scotland , he said , ‘ he wondered how men of liberal education would choose to become clergymen there ; ’ and asked , ‘ whether in the remote parts of the country , the clergy , in general were not very ignorant ? ’ I answered , ‘ No , for that education was very cheap in Scotland , and that the clergy , in general , were men of good sense , and competent learning . ’ He asked whether we had any good preachers at Aberdeen ? I said , yes , and named Campbell and Gerard , with whose names , however , I did not find that he was acquainted . Dr. Majendie mentioned Dr. Oswald 's ‘ Appeal ’ with commendation ; I praised it too and the queen took down the name , with a view to send for it . I was asked , whether I knew Dr. Oswald ? I answered , I did not ; and said , that my book was published before I read his ; that Dr. O. was well known to Lord Kinnoull , who had often proposed to make us acquainted . We discussed a great many other topics ; for the conversation , as before observed , lasted for upwards of an hour , without any intermission . The Queen bore a large share in it . Both the King and her Majesty showed a great deal of good sense , acuteness , and knowledge , as well as of good nature and affability . At last the king took out his watch ( for it was now almost three o'clock , his hour of dinner ) , which Dr. Majendie and I took as a signal to withdraw . We accordingly bowed to their Majesties , and I addressed the King in these words : ‘ I hope , Sir , your Majesty will pardon me , if I take this opportunity to return you my humble and most grateful acknowledgments , for the honour you have been pleased to confer upon me . ’ He immediately answered , ‘ I think I could do no less for a man who has done so much service to the cause of Christianity . I shall always be glad of an opportunity to show the good opinion I have of you . ’ The Queen sate all the while , and the King stood , sometimes walking about a little . Her Majesty speaks the English language with surprising elegance , and little or nothing of a foreign accent . There is something wonderfully captivating in her manner ; so that if she were only of the rank of a private gentlewoman , one could not help taking notice of her , as one of the most agreeable women in the world . Her face is much more pleasing than any of her pictures ; and in the expression of her eyes , and in her smile , there is something peculiarly engaging . When the Doctor and I came out , ‘ Pray , ’ said I , ‘ how did I behave ? Tell me honestly , for I am not accustomed to conversations of this kind . ’ ‘ Why , perfectly well , ’ answered he , ‘ and just as you ought to do . ’ ‘ Are you sure of that ? ’ said I . ‘ As sure , ’ he replied , ‘ as of my own existence : and you may be assured of it too , when I tell you , that if there had been any thing in your manner or conversation which was not perfectly agreeable , your conference would have been at an end in eight or ten minutes at most . ’ The Doctor afterwards told me , that it was a most uncommon thing for a private man , and a commoner , to be honoured with so long an audience . I dined with Dr. and Mrs. Majendie , and their family , and returned to town in the evening , very much pleased with the occurrences of the day . ”</p>
   <p>At this time , Sir Joshua Reynolds , having requested Beattie to sit for his picture , produced a likeness of him , which is generally regarded as one of the finest works of that admirable artist . He is represented in his Oxford gown of Doctor of Laws , with his famous Essay under his arm ; while beside him is Truth , habited as an Angel , holding in one hand a pair of scales , and with the other thrusting down three frightful figures , emblematic of Prejudice , Scepticism , and Folly . [ R ] Of this picture Sir Joshua made a present to Beattie , who set a due value on so noble a composition , and preserved it with the utmost care .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">After an absence of a little more than five months , he returned to</l>
     <l n="2">Aberdeen .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A striking proof how highly the character and talents of Beattie were appreciated , even by those to whom he was personally unknown , occurred in October of this year ( 1773 ) , when the chair of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh was offered to him by the electors , the magistrates of the city . He , however , declined accepting it , “ Though my fortune ” ( he writes to Sir William Forbes , on the subject ) “ were as narrow now as it lately was , I should still incline rather to remain in quiet where I am , than , by becoming a member of the University of Edinburgh , to place myself within the reach of those ( few as they are ) who have been pleased to let the world know that they do not wish me well . ” He alludes to the enemies whom his Essay on Truth had raised up .</p>
   <p>The Second Book of The Minstrel , together with a new and corrected edition of the First , appeared in 1774 , the author 's name being now added . The poem , thus enlarged , suffered no diminution of its popularity .</p>
   <p>The following year , Beattie and his wife spent several weeks in London , residing during the chief part of the time with Dr. Porteus , one of his kindest and most zealous friends . On this occasion , having shown himself at court , he was immediately recognized by the King , who spoke to him very graciously , and made several inquiries concerning his studies .</p>
   <p>To a new and improved edition in quarto , of the Essay on Truth , printed by subscription , [ S ] in 1776 , our author appended three other Essays : On Poetry and Music , as they affect the Mind , On Laughter and Ludicrous Composition , and On the Utility of Classical Learning . In 1777 , [ T ] he gave to the press a new edition of The Minstrel , to which he added a few of his minor poems : this volume ( he says in the preface ) contains “ all the verses of which I am willing to be considered as the author . ” In 1778 , [ U ] he printed for private circulation a Letter to Dr. Blair , on the improvement of Psalmody in Scotland . In 1779 , he published , for the use of the young men who attended his Lectures , a List of Scotticisms , to the amount of about two hundred . And in 1780 , he contributed some thoughts On Dreaming to the well known periodical paper , The Mirror .</p>
   <p>The following portion of a letter from Dr. Johnson to Beattie shows how sincerely our author was esteemed by the great moralist :</p>
   <p>“ Bolt Court , Fleet Street , 21st August , 1780 .</p>
   <p>“ More years than I have any delight to reckon have past since you and I saw one another . Of this , however , there is no reason for making any reprehensory complaint , sic fata ferunt : but , methinks , there might pass some small interchange of regard between us . If you say that I ought to have written , I now write ; and I write to tell you , that I have much kindness for you and Mrs. Beattie , and that I wish your health better , and your life long . Try change of air , and come a few degrees southward ; a softer climate may do you both good . Winter is coming on , and London will be warmer , and gayer , and busier , and more fertile of amusement than Aberdeen . ”</p>
   <p>In 1781 , Beattie made another journey to London , taking with him his eldest son , James Hay Beattie . [ V ] While there , we find him writing thus to Sir William Forbes :</p>
   <p>“ 1st June .</p>
   <p>“ I have been visiting all my friends again and again , and found them as affectionate and attentive as ever . Death has indeed deprived me of some since I was last here , of Garrick , and Armstrong , and poor Harry Smith ; but I have still many left . ” ... “ Johnson grows in grace as he grows in years . He not only has better health and a fresher complexion than ever he had before ( at least since I knew him ) , but he has contracted a gentleness of manners which pleases every body . ”</p>
   <p>“ 28th June .</p>
   <p>“ I thought it my duty to appear at the levee before I left London ; and accordingly the week before last I went to court . The king had not seen me for six years , and yet , to my surprise , knew me at first sight . He spoke to me with his wonted condescension and affability ; and paid me a very polite compliment on the subject of my writings . ”</p>
   <p>His Dissertations , Moral and Critical , were published in 1783 .</p>
   <p>A passage from a letter of the poet Cowper to the Rev . William Unwin , 5th April , 1784 , [ W ] must not be omitted here :</p>
   <p>“ If you have not his poem , called the ‘ The Minstrel , ’ and cannot borrow it , I must beg you to buy it for me ; for , though I cannot afford to deal largely in so expensive a commodity as books , I must afford to purchase at least the poetical works of Beattie . ”</p>
   <p>His health impaired , and his peace of mind destroyed , by the melancholy condition of his wife ( who , labouring under confirmed insanity , was now removed from her family ) , we need not wonder that Beattie should endeavour to forget his domestic griefs in the society of his English friends , to whom he was ever welcome . During the year 1784 , after passing some time in London , he spent a month with Dr. Porteus ( who had now attained the rank of Bishop of Chester ) , at the beautiful parsonage of Hunton , near Maidstone , which he characterizes as “ the mansion of peace , piety , and cheerfulness . ” He also visited Mrs. Montagu , at her seat , called Sandleford , in Berks .</p>
   <p>In 1786 , his Evidences of the Christian Religion , were published . A remark which he makes in a letter , while engaged in the composition of this judicious summary , is worth quoting : “ Whether this work shall ever be of use to others , I know not ; but this I know , that it has been of considerable benefit to myself . For though , when I entered upon it , I understood my subject well enough to entertain no doubt of the goodness of my cause , yet I find , as I advance , new light continually breaking in upon me . ”</p>
   <p>The receipt of the following letter could hardly fail to gratify our author :</p>
   <p>“ Philadelphia , 1st August , 1786 .</p>
   <p>“ The American revolution , which divided the British empire , made no breach in the republic of letters . As a proof of this , a stranger to your person , and a citizen of a country lately hostile to yours , has expressed his obligations to you for the knowledge and pleasure he has derived from your excellent writings by procuring your admission into the American Philosophical Society ; a certificate of which , subscribed by our illustrious president , Dr. Franklin , and the other officers of the society , you will receive by the next vessel that sails to any port in North Britain from this city .</p>
   <p>“ The stranger alluded to finished his studies in medicine in Edinburgh in the year 1769 , and has ever since taught chemistry and medicine in the college of Philadelphia . His name ( with the greatest respect for yours ) is ,</p>
   <p>“ BENJAMIN RUSH . ”</p>
   <p>The next year , with his eldest son for his companion , he repaired again to London . While there , he writes thus to his niece , Miss Valentine , now Mrs. Glennie :</p>
   <p>“ London , 20th July , 1787 .</p>
   <p>“ I am just returned from Windsor , where I passed three days . I went thither , partly to see some friends , but chiefly that I might pay my respects to the King and Queen . They both received me in the most gracious manner . I saw the King first on the terrace , where he knew me at first sight , and did me the honour to converse with me a considerable time . Next morning I saw him again at prayers in his chapel , where he was pleased to introduce me to the Queen , who inquired very kindly after my health ; observed , that many years had passed since she saw me last ; regretted the bad weather which I had met with at Windsor ( for it rained incessantly ,) which , said she , has made your friends see less of you than they wished ; and , after some other conversation , her Majesty and the Princess Elizabeth , who attended her , made a slight courtesy , and stepped into the carriage that waited for them at the chapel door . The King remained with us for some time longer , and talked of various matters . ”</p>
   <p>Our author then proceeded to visit Dr. Porteus at Hunton , and Mrs. Montagu at Sandleford , but was obliged to quit the latter place sooner than he had intended , on account of the illness of his son , who shewed symptoms of that consumptive complaint to which he afterwards fell a victim . For the sake of medical advice Beattie carried him back to the metropolis , and from thence , by very easy stages , to Aberdeen . Soon after his return to Scotland , the invalid improved so much in health that he was able to take upon him part of the management of the class of Moral Philosophy in the Marischal College , having been appointed in June of this year ( when he was not quite nineteen ) assistant professor to his father .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">In 1790 , Beattie put forth the first volume of his Elements of Moral</l>
     <l n="2">Science ; and superintended an edition of Addison 's Periodical Papers ,</l>
     <l n="3">adding a few notes to Tickell 's Life of that author , and to Johnson 's</l>
     <l n="4">Remarks on his Prose Writings . The second volume of the Transactions of</l>
     <l n="5">the Royal Society of Edinburgh , published during this year , contains</l>
     <l n="6">‘ Remarks on some Passages of the Sixth Book of the AEneid , ’ from</l>
     <l n="7">Beattie 's pen .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>He had now to suffer the dire bereavement which he had long foreseen , the loss of his eldest son , the object of his fondest affection . He thus informs the Duchess of Gordon of the melancholy event :</p>
   <p>“ Aberdeen , 1st December , 1790 .</p>
   <p>“ Knowing with what kindness and condescension your grace takes an interest in every thing that concerns me and my little family , I take the liberty to inform you , that my son James is dead ; that the last duties to him are now paid ; and that I am endeavouring to return , with the little ability that is left me , and with entire submission to the will of Providence , to the ordinary business of life . I have lost one who was always a pleasing companion ; but who , for the last five or six years , was one of the most entertaining and instructive companions that ever man was blest with : for his mind comprehended almost every science ; he was a most attentive observer of life and manners ; a master of classical learning ; and he possessed an exuberance of wit and humour , a force of understanding , and a correctness and delicacy of taste , beyond any other person of his age I have ever known .</p>
   <p>“ He was taken ill in the night of the 30th of November , 1789 ; and from that time his decline commenced . It was long what physicians call a nervous atrophy ; but towards the end of June , symptoms began to appear of the lungs being affected . Goats ’ milk , and afterwards asses ’ milk , were procured for him in abundance ; and such exercise as he could bear , he regularly took ; these means lengthened his days no doubt , and alleviated his sufferings , which indeed were not often severe : but , in spite of all that could be done , he grew weaker and weaker , and died the 19th of November , 1790 , without complaint or pain , without even a groan or a sigh ; retaining to the last moment the use of his rational faculties ; indeed , from first to last , not one delirious word ever escaped him . He lived twenty-two years and thirteen days . Many weeks before it came , he saw death approaching , and he met it with such composure and pious resignation , as may no doubt be equalled , but cannot be surpassed .</p>
   <p>“ He has left many things in writing , serious and humorous , scientific and miscellaneous , prose and verse , Latin and English ; but it will be a long time before I shall be able to harden my heart so far as to revise them . ”</p>
   <p>In April of the following year , Beattie again travelled southwards , accompanied by Montagu , [ X ] his second son and only surviving child . They remained some weeks in Edinburgh , and then journeyed slowly to London , which after a short stay they quitted for the summer residence of Dr. Porteus , who was now elevated to the see of the metropolis . The tranquillity of Fulham Palace , and the kind attentions of its inhabitants , contributed greatly to amend the health and raise the spirits of our author ; and he seems to have enjoyed the company of the distinguished persons with whom he had an opportunity of associating . “ Last week , ” he writes to Sir William Forbes , 30th June , 1791 , “ I made a morning visit to Mr. Pitt . I had heard him spoken of as a grave and reserved man ; but saw nothing of it . He gave me a very frank , and indeed affectionate reception ; and was so cheerful , and in his conversation so easy , that I almost thought myself in the company rather of an old acquaintance than of a great statesman . He was pleased to pay me some very obliging compliments , asked about my health , and how I meant to pass the summer ; spoke of the Duchess of Gordon , the improvements of Edinburgh , and various other matters : and when I told him , I knew not what apology to make for intruding upon him , said , that no apology was necessary , for that he was very glad to see me , and desired to see me again . ” Before returning to Scotland , the travellers went to Bath , and from thence to Sandleford , the seat of Mrs. Montagu .</p>
   <p>The second volume of the Elements of Moral Science appeared in 1793 . During the same year the sudden death of his favourite sister , Mrs. Valentine , increased the domestic sorrows of Beattie . His health was at this period so greatly impaired , that being unable to attend to his duties of Professor in the Marischal College , he engaged his old pupil , Mr. Glennie , as an assistant : occasionally , however , he continued to lecture to his class till the commencement of the winter session of 1797 .</p>
   <p>For some time past he had occupied himself in the melancholy yet pleasing task of editing a volume of the compositions of his eldest son . From a pardonable partiality for the writings of a beloved child , and from his not very accurate attainments in classical scholarship , he admitted into the collection several pieces , both English and Latin , which fall considerably below mediocrity . A few copies of the work were privately printed in 1794 , under the title of Essays and Fragments in Prose and Verse , by James Hay Beattie , and were “ offered as presents to those friends with whom the author was particularly acquainted or connected . "[ Y ] Though it undoubtedly shows that the deceased was a young man of uncommon quickness of talent , and the most indefatigable application , it exhibits nothing which has a claim to be considered as the offspring of genius . [ Z ] The most interesting portion of the volume is the biographical sketch prefixed to it by the afflicted father , a memoir of exquisite simplicity and pathos . The account given by Beattie of the method which he adopted in imparting to his son the first idea of a Supreme Being is too striking to be omitted here :</p>
   <p>“ The doctrines of religion I wished to impress on his mind , as soon as it might be prepared to receive them ; but I did not see the propriety of making him commit to memory theological sentences , or any sentences which it was not possible for him to understand . And I was desirous to make a trial how far his own reason could go in tracing out , with a little direction , the great and first principle of all religion , the being of God . The following fact is mentioned , not as a proof of superior sagacity in him ( for I have no doubt that most children would in like circumstances think as he did ) , but merely as a moral or logical experiment : He had reached his fifth ( or sixth ) year , knew the alphabet , and could read a little ; but had received no particular information with respect to the Author of his being ; because I thought he could not yet understand such information ; and because I had learned , from my own experience , that to be made to repeat words not understood is extremely detrimental to the faculties of a young mind . In a corner of a little garden , without informing any person of the circumstance , I wrote in the mould , with my finger , the three initial letters of his name ; and sowing garden-cresses in the furrows , covered up the seed , and smoothed the ground . Ten days after , he came running to me , and with astonishment in his countenance , told me that his name was growing in the garden . I smiled at the report , and seemed inclined to disregard it ; but he insisted on my going to see what had happened . Yes , said I carelessly , on coming to the place , I see it is so ; but there is nothing in this worth notice ; it is mere chance ; and I went away . He followed me and taking hold of my coat , said , with some earnestness , It could not be mere chance ; for that somebody must have contrived matters so as to produce it .— I pretend not to give his words , or my own , for I have forgotten both ; but I give the substance of what passed between us in such language as we both understood .— So you think , I said , that what appears so regular as the letters of your name , cannot be by chance . Yes , said he , with firmness , I think so . Look at yourself , I replied , and consider your hands and fingers , your legs and feet , and other limbs ; are not they regular in their appearance , and useful to you ? He said , they were . Came you then hither , said I , by chance ? No , he answered , that cannot be ; something must have made me . And who is that something ? I asked . He said he did not know . ( I took particular notice , that he did not say , as Rousseau fancies a child in like circumstances would say , that his parents made him . ) I had now gained the point I aimed at , and saw that his reason taught him ( though he could not so express it ) that what begins to be must have a cause , and that what is formed with regularity must have an intelligent cause . I therefore told him the name of the Great Being who made him and all the world ; concerning whose adorable nature I gave him such information as I thought he could in some measure comprehend . The lesson affected him greatly , and he never forgot either it , or the circumstance that introduced it . ”</p>
   <p>After the loss of this highly-gifted youth , the only tie which bound Beattie to the world was his second son , who , though far inferior to the deceased in learning , was endowed with no ordinary talents . [ AA ] Just as our author was anxiously forming plans for his future establishment in life , Montagu was unexpectedly carried off by a fever of only a few days ’ continuance , in the eighteenth year of his age . Beattie thus communicates to Sir William Forbes the intelligence of his death :</p>
   <p>“ Aberdeen , 14th March , 1796 .</p>
   <p>“ Our plans relating to Montagu are all at an end . I am sorry to give you the pain of being informed , that he died this morning at five . His disorder was a fever , from which at first we had little apprehension ; but it cut him off in five days . He himself thought from the beginning that it would be fatal ; and , before the delirium came on , spoke with great composure and Christian piety of his approaching dissolution : he even gave some directions about his funeral . The delirium was very violent , and continued till within a few minutes of his death , when he was heard to repeat in a whisper the Lord 's prayer , and began an unfinished sentence , of which nothing could be heard but the words incorruptible glory . Pious sentiments prevailed in his mind through life , and did not leave him till death ; nor then , I trust , did they leave him . Notwithstanding the extreme violence of his fever , he seemed to suffer little pain , either in body or in mind , and as his end drew near , a smile settled upon his countenance . I need not tell you that he had every attention that skilful and affectionate physicians could bestow . I give you the trouble to notify this event to Mr. Arbuthnot . I would have written to him , but have many things to mind , and but indifferent health . However , I heartily acquiesce in the dispensations of Providence , which are all good and wise . God bless you and your family .</p>
   <p>“ He will be much regretted ; for wherever he went he was a very popular character . ”</p>
   <p>Such an effect had this fresh calamity on the intellectual powers of Beattie , that a few days after Montagu 's death , he experienced a temporary hut almost utter loss of memory respecting him . Having searched every room in the house , he would say to his niece , Mrs. Glennie , “ You may think it strange , but I must ask you if I have a son , and where he is ? ” She then felt herself under the painful necessity of calling to his recollection the sufferings of Montagu , the mention of which never failed to restore him to reason . Often with tears he would declare himself thankful that his children were in the grave , exclaiming , in allusion to their mother 's malady , “ How could I have borne to see their elegant minds mangled with madness ! ” On viewing the dead body of Montagu for the last time , he said , “ I have now done with the world . ”</p>
   <p>The following passages from two of his letters , written about this period , are deeply affecting . He tells the Rev . Dr. Laing , 10th April , 1796 :</p>
   <p>“ I hope I am resigned , as my duty requires , and as I wish to be ; but I have passed many a bitter hour , though on those occasions nobody sees me . I fear my reason is a little disordered , for I have sometimes thought of late , especially in a morning , that Montagu is not dead , though I seem to have a remembrance of a dream that he is . This you will say , what I myself believe , is a symptom not uncommon in cases similar to mine , and that I ought by all means to go from home as soon as I can . I will do so when the weather becomes tolerable . ”</p>
   <p>To Sir William Forbes he says , 17th of the same month :</p>
   <p>“ I have been these many days resolving to write to you and Mr. Arbuthnot , to thank you for your very kind and sympathetic letters , but various things have come in my way to prevent it . I need not pretend a hurry of business , for every-body knows I am not capable of any . A deep gloom hangs upon me , and disables all my faculties ; and thoughts so strange sometimes occur to me as to make me ‘ fear that I am not , ’ as Lear says , ‘ in my perfect mind . ’ But I thank God I am entirely resigned to the divine will ; and , though I am now childless , I have friends whose goodness to me , and other virtues , I find great comfort in recollecting . The physicians not only advise , but entreat , and indeed command me to go from home , and that without further delay ; and I do seriously resolve to set out for Edinburgh to-morrow . ”</p>
   <p>Though Beattie never from henceforth engaged in any kind of study , he still found some enjoyment in books , and still derived some pleasure from the society of a very few of his oldest friends . He almost entirely ceased to correspond , even with those whom he most valued ; yet when he happened to receive a letter from any of them , his spirits were always excited for the rest of the day . Music , in which he had once delighted , had become disagreeable to him since the loss of his eldest son . [ AB ] A few months , however , before Montagu 's death , he had occasionally played an accompaniment while Montagu sung ; but now , when prevailed on to resume his favourite violoncello , he was always dissatisfied with his own performance . “ My fingers , ” he writes to the Rev . Dr. Laing , 5th June , 1798 , “ have not strength to press down the strings . ”</p>
   <p>In this state he continued till the beginning of April , 1799 , when he was struck with palsy , which , for eight days , rendered him nearly incapable of utterance . At different times the disease repeated its attacks , the last of which , on the 5th of October , 1802 , deprived him entirely of the power of motion . On the morning of the 18th of August , 1803 , he expired without a struggle , in the sixty-eighth year of his age .</p>
   <p>His remains were laid , according to his own desire , beside those of his children , in the church-yard of St. Nicholas , at Aberdeen ; and a Latin inscription , from the pen of the late Dr. James Gregory , of Edinburgh , marks the spot of his interment .</p>
   <p>In person he was of the middle size , of a broad , square make , which seemed to indicate a more robust constitution than he really possessed . In his gait there was something of a slouch . During his later years he grew corpulent and unwieldy ; but a few months before his death his hulk was greatly diminished . His features were very regular ; his complexion somewhat dark . His eyes were black , brilliant , full of a tender and melancholy expression , and , in the course of conversation with his friends , became extremely animated .</p>
   <p>Though I am of opinion with Gilbert Wakefield , that the maxim De mortuis nil nisi VERUM is better than De mortuis nil nisi BONUM , it is with pain that I touch on the reported failing of so truly good a man as Beattie . It has been asserted that towards the close of life he indulged to excess in the use of wine . In a letter to Mr. Arbuthnot , he says , “ With the present pressure upon my mind , I should not be able to sleep , if I did not use wine as an opiate ; it is less hurtful than laudanum , but not so effectual . ” He may , perhaps , have had too frequent recourse to so palatable a medicine , in the hope of banishing for a while the recollection of his sorrows ; and if , under any circumstances , such a fault is to be regarded as venial , it may be excused in one who was a more than widowed husband and a childless father .</p>
   <p>The prose writings of Beattie appear of late years to have fallen into disrepute ; and the once celebrated Essay on Truth is at present as much undervalued as it was formerly overrated .</p>
   <p>His fame now rests upon The Minstrel alone . Since its first publication , many poems of a far loftier and more original character have been produced in England ; yet still does it maintain its popularity ; and still in Edwin , that happy personification of the poetic temperament , do young and enthusiastic readers delight to recognize a picture of themselves . Though we cannot fail to regret that Beattie should have left it incomplete , yet we do not long for the concluding books from any interest which we take in the story , such as is excited by some other unfinished works of genius , the tale of Cambuscan , for instance , or the legend of Christabel . In The Minstrel , indeed , there is but little invention ; it is a poem of sentiment and description , conveying to us lessons of true philosophy in language of surpassing beauty , and displaying pictures of nature , in her romantic solitudes , painted by a master 's hand . “ On my once asking Dr. Beattie , ” says Sir William Forbes , “ in what manner he had intended to employ his Minstrel , had he completed his original design of extending the poem to a third canto , he said , he proposed to have introduced a foreign enemy as invading his country , in consequence of which the Minstrel was to employ himself in rousing his countrymen to arms . "[ AC ] But surely such a conclusion would have formed too violent a contrast to the repose of the earlier books ; and the charm which attaches us to the meditative Edwin , while a wanderer among the lonely hills and groves , would have been broken , or at least weakened , by placing him amid the throng of warriors and the din of arms .</p>
   <p>With the exception of The Hermit and the following exquisite stanza [ AD ] of Retirement , there is little worthy of particular notice in the minor poems of Beattie .</p>
   <p>FOOTNOTES :</p>
   <p>[ A ] “ At his leisure hours he cultivated the muses . A journal kept by him , as well as some specimens of his poetry , are still in the possession of his descendants . This last circumstance is the more worthy of being noticed , as it proves that Dr. Beattie derived his poetical turn from his father . ” — Bower 's Life of Beattie , 1804 , p. 2 .</p>
   <p>[ B ] According to Bower , Beattie was supported at college by the generosity of his brother David , who accompanied him to Aberdeen , when he first quitted Laurencekirk to commence his course at the University . “ The peculiar mode of their conveyance to Aberdeen is a matter of very trifling moment . It may not be unacceptable to some , however , to be informed , that they rode on one horse ; and at a season of the year not the most agreeable for undertaking a journey ( when good roads were unknown in Scotland ) of thirty English miles . ” — Life of Beattie , 1804 , p. 17 .</p>

   <p>[ H ] Sir William Forbes says it “ had a rapid sale . ” Mr. A. Chalmers , however ( Poets , vol . xviii . p. 519 ) , doubts if it was ever published for sale , except in Beattie 's Poems , 1766 , in the Advertisement to which we are told that it “ appeared in a separate pamphlet in the beginning of the year 1765 . ” I have been unable to meet with the original edition .</p>
   <p>[ I ] I have been told that the poem consisted originally of only four stanzas , and that the two beautiful ones with which it now concludes were added , a considerable time after the others were written , at the request of Mrs. Carnegie , of Charlton , near Montrose . This lady , whose maiden name was Scott , was authoress of a poem called Dunotter Castle , printed in the second edition of Colman and Thornton 's Poems by Eminent Ladies .</p>
   <p>‘ Pentland Hills ’ , for which Beattie wrote The Hermit , was an air composed by Mr. Tytler , of Woodhouselee , in imitation of the old Scottish melodies .</p>
   <p>[ J ] On one occasion , I have been informed , she took some China jars from the chimney-piece , and carefully arranged them on the top of the parlour door , in order that when Beattie opened it , they might fall upon his head .</p>
   <p>[ K ] Beattie 's Verses were printed in the Aberdeen Journal , together with an introductory letter in prose also by him , signed “ Oliver Oldstile . ” The writer of the Life of Ross , in that pleasing compilation , Lives of Scottish Poets , 3 vols . 1822 , says : “ The author of both productions was generally understood to be Dr. Beattie ; and they have remained so long ascribed to him without contradiction , that there can be little doubt of their being from his pen . ” Part iii . p. 107 . There is no doubt about the matter ; Beattie owns them in a letter to Blacklock .— Forbes 's Life of Beattie , vol . i. p. 153. ed . 1807 .

   <p>[ Q ] At a subsequent period , after the king had granted him a pension , he received two offers of church preferment in England — the one from Mr. Pitt , of Dorsetshire , of a living in that county worth L150 per annum , the other from Dr. Thomas , Bishop of Winchester , of a living in Hants , valued at L500 a year — neither of which he would accept . In the letter wherein he declines the second noble offer , he thus expresses himself :</p>
   <p>“ I wrote the ‘ Essays on Truth ’ with the certain prospect of raising many enemies , with very faint hopes of attracting the public attention , and without any views of advancing my fortune . I published it , however , because I thought it might probably do a little good , by bringing to nought , or , at least , lessening the reputation of that wretched system of sceptical philosophy , which had made a most alarming progress , and done incredible mischief to this country . My enemies have been at great pains to represent my views , in that publication , as very different : and that my principal , or only motive was to make a book , and , if possible , to raise myself higher in the world . So that , if I were now to accept preferment in the church , I should be apprehensive that I might strengthen the hands of the gainsayer , and give the world some ground to believe that my love of truth was not quite so ardent , or so pure , as I had pretended .</p>
   <p>“ Besides , might it not have the appearance of levity and insincerity , and , by some , be construed into a want of principle , if I were , at these years ( for I am now thirty-eight ) , to make such an important change in my way of life , and to quit , with no other apparent motive than that of bettering my circumstances , that church of which I have hitherto been a member ? If my book has any tendency to do good , as I flatter myself it has , I would not , for the wealth of the Indies , do any thing to counteract that tendency ; and I am afraid that tendency might , in some measure be counteracted ( at least in this country ) if I were to give the adversary the least ground to charge me with inconsistency . It is true , that the force of my reasonings cannot be really affected by my character ; truth is truth , whoever be the speaker ; but even truth itself becomes less respectable , when spoken , or supposed to be spoken , by insincere lips .</p>
   <p>“ It has also been hinted to me , by several persons of very sound judgment , that what I have written , or may hereafter write in favour of religion , has a chance of being more attended to , if I continue a layman , than if I were to become a clergyman . Nor am I without apprehensions ( though some of my friends think them ill founded ) that , from entering so late in life , and from so remote a province , into the Church of England , some degree of ungracefulness , particularly in pronunciation , might adhere to my performances in public , sufficient to render them less pleasing , and consequently less useful . ”</p>

     <l n="1">[ R ] So Beattie names the figures in one of his letters ; but Sir William</l>
     <l n="2">Forbes tells us they are supposed to mean Sophistry , Scepticism , and</l>
     <l n="3">Infidelity . The worthy Baronet proceeds to observe :</l>
   </lg>
   <p>“ Because one of these was a lean figure and the [ an ] other a fat one , people of lively imaginations pleased themselves with finding in them the portraits of Voltaire and Mr. Hume . But Sir Joshua , I have reason to believe , had no such thought when he painted those figures . ”</p>
   <p>Surely Sir William had never read all the letters which he printed in his Life of Beattie , for in vol . ii . p. 42 , octavo ed ., we find the great painter writing to our poet as follows , in February , 1774 :</p>
   <p>“ Mr. Hume has heard from somebody that he is introduced in the picture , not much to his credit ; there is only a figure , covering his face with his hands , which they may call Hume or any body else ; it is true it has a tolerable broad back . As for Voltaire , I intended he should be one of the group . ”</p>
   <p>This fine picture is now at Aberdeen , in the possession of Beattie 's niece , Mrs. Glennie .</p>
   <p>[ S ] When Beattie was in London , in 1773 , and when it was doubtful whether government would ever make any provision for him , his friends there set on foot a subscription for this work . “ It was a thing , ” says he , in a letter to Lady Mayne , January , 1774 , “ of a private nature entirely ; projected not by me , but by some of my friends , who had condescended to charge themselves with the whole trouble of it : it was never meant to be made public , nor put into the hands of booksellers , nor carried on by solicitation , but was to be considered as a voluntary mark of the approbation of some persons of rank and fortune , who wished it to be known that they patronized me on account of what I had written in defence of truth , ” &amp; c. Prefixed to the volume is a list of nearly five hundred subscribers , among whom are many distinguished characters in church and state .</p>
   <p>[ T ] A spurious edition of his Juvenile Poems , with some which he never wrote , from Dodsley 's Collection , was put forth in 1780 . This volume he disowned in a public advertisement .</p>
   <p>[ U ] Perhaps it was not printed till the beginning of the following year . In a letter to Beattie , dated Feb. 1st , 1779 , Mrs. Montagu says , “ I was much pleased with your pamphlet on Psalmody . ”</p>
   <p>[ V ] He was born in 1768 , and was named after James Hay , Earl of Errol , our author 's early patron .</p>
   <p>[ W ] Writing from Edinburgh , 28th May , 1784 , to his niece , Miss Valentine ( now Mrs. Glennie ) , Beattie describes the sensation caused in that city by the performances of Mrs. Siddons . He says that he met her at the house of Lord Buchan ; that he played to her many Scotch airs on the violoncello , with which she was much gratified ; and that “ she sung ‘ Queen Mary 's Complaint ’ to admiration , and I had the honour to accompany her on the bass . ” — Forbes 's Life of Beattie , vol . ii . p. 324 , octavo ed .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">I am informed , by the incomparable actress in question , that the</l>
     <l n="2">quotation just given contains an utter falsehood , which , when Forbes 's</l>
     <l n="3">Life of our author first appeared , in 1806 , she read with astonishment .</l>
     <l n="4">She remembers perfectly having been introduced to Beattie at Lord</l>
     <l n="5">Buchan 's , but she is quite certain she did not sing either Queen</l>
     <l n="6">Mary 's Complaint or any other song ; and she observes , that if she had</l>
     <l n="7">sung to his accompaniment , the circumstance would have been so striking</l>
     <l n="8">that it could not possibly have escaped her recollection .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Qy . Has Beattie 's letter been mutilated , the person who transcribed it for the press having by mistake omitted some lines ? and do the words “ she sung , ” in the concluding sentence , refer to some other more musical lady , and not to Mrs. Siddons ?</p>
   <p>[ X ] He was so named after Mrs. Montagu . From one of Beattie 's letters , dated 1789 , it appears that she had made a handsome present of money to her godson .</p>
   <p>[ Y ] I possess a copy of it which bears the following inscription :</p>
   <p>“ To William Hayley , Esq ., in testimony of the utmost respect , esteem , and gratitude , from J. Beattie . 1st January , 1796 . ”</p>
   <p>On one of its fly-leaves the ever-ready pen of Hayley has written the subjoined sonnet :</p>
   <p>TO DOCTOR BEATTIE , IN GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS VERY INTERESTING PRESENT .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ Bard of the North ! I thank thee with my tears</l>
     <l n="2">For this fond work of thy paternal hand :</l>
     <l n="3">It bids the buried youth before me stand</l>
     <l n="4">In nature 's softest light , which love endears .</l>
     <l n="5">Parents like thee , whose grief the world reveres ,</l>
     <l n="6">Faithful to pure affection 's proud command ,</l>
     <l n="7">For a lost child have lasting honours plann 'd ,</l>
     <l n="8">To give in fame what fate denied in years .</l>
     <l n="9">The filial form of Icarus was wrought</l>
     <l n="10">By his afflicted sire , the sire of art !</l>
     <l n="11">And Tullia 's fane engross 'd her father 's heart :</l>
     <l n="12">That fane rose only in perturbed thought ;</l>
     <l n="13">But sweet perfection crowns , as truth begun ,</l>
     <l n="14">This Christian image of thy happier son . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>[ Z ] It was afterwards published for sale in 1799 . I extract from it a jeu d'esprit — one of those pieces which Beattie printed , in opposition to the advice of Sir William Forbes and some other grave friends .</p>

    <head>ADVERTISEMENT .</head>
     <l n="1">January , 1777 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Having lately seen in print some poems ascribed to me which I never wrote , and some of my own inaccurately copied , I thought it would not be improper to publish , in this little volume , all the verses of which I am willing to be considered as the author . Many others I did indeed write in the early part of my life ; but they were in general so incorrect , that I would not rescue them from oblivion , even if a wish could do it .</p>
   <p>Some of the few now offered to the Public would perhaps have been suppressed , if in making this collection I had implicitly followed my own judgment . But in so small a matter , who would refuse to submit his opinion to that of a friend ?</p>
   <p>It is of no consequence to the reader to know the date of any of these little poems . But some private reasons determined the author to add , that most of them were written many years age , and that the greatest part of the MINSTREL , which is his latest attempt in this way , was composed in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight .</p>
   <p>PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL .</p>
   <p>The design was to trace the progress of a Poetical Genius , born in a rude age , from the first dawning of fancy and reason , till that period at which he may be supposed capable of appearing in the world as a Minstrel , that is , as an itinerant Poet and Musician ;— a character which , according to the notions of our forefathers , was not only respectable , but sacred .</p>
   <p>I have endeavoured to imitate Spenser in the measure of his verse , and in the harmony , simplicity , and variety of his composition . Antique expressions I have avoided ; admitting , however , some old words , where they seemed to suit the subject ; but I hope none will be found that are now obsolete , or in any degree not intelligible to a reader of English poetry .</p>
   <p>To those who may be disposed to ask , what could induce me to write in so difficult a measure , I can only answer that it pleases my ear , and seems , from its Gothic structure and original , to bear some relation to the subject and spirit of the Poem . It admits both simplicity and magnificence of sound and of language beyond any other stanza that I am acquainted with . It allows the sententiousness of the couplet , as well as the more complex modulation of blank verse . What some critics have remarked , of its uniformity growing at last tiresome to the ear , will be found to hold true , only when the poetry is faulty in other respects .</p>

    <head>ELEGY .</head>
    <head>WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1758 .</head>
     <l n="1">Still shall unthinking man substantial deem</l>
     <l n="2">The forms that fleet through life 's deceitful dream ?</l>
     <l n="3">Till at some stroke of Fate the vision flies ,</l>
     <l n="4">And sad realities in prospect rise ;</l>
     <l n="5">And , from Elysian slumbers rudely torn ,</l>
     <l n="6">The startled soul awakes , to think , and mourn .</l>
     <l n="7">O ye , whose hours in jocund train advance ,</l>
     <l n="8">Whose spirits to the song of gladness dance ,</l>
     <l n="9">Who flowery plains in endless pomp survey ,</l>
     <l n="10">Glittering in beams of visionary day ;</l>
     <l n="11">O yet , while Fate delays th ’ impending woe ,</l>
     <l n="12">Be rous 'd to thought , anticipate the blow ;</l>
     <l n="13">Lest , like the lightning 's glance , the sudden ill</l>
     <l n="14">Flash to confound , and penetrate to kill ;</l>
     <l n="15">Lest , thus encompass 'd with funereal gloom ,</l>
     <l n="16">Like me , ye bend o'er some untimely tomb ,</l>
     <l n="17">Pour your wild ravings in Night 's frighted ear ,</l>
     <l n="18">And half pronounce Heaven 's sacred doom severe .</l>
     <l n="19">Wise , beauteous , good ! O every grace combin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="20">That charms the eye , or captivates the mind !</l>
     <l n="21">Fresh , as the floweret opening on the morn ,</l>
     <l n="22">Whose leaves bright drops of liquid pearl adorn !</l>
     <l n="23">Sweet , as the downy-pinion 'd gale , that roves</l>
     <l n="24">To gather fragrance in Arabian groves !</l>
     <l n="25">Mild , as the melodies at close of day ,</l>
     <l n="26">That , heard remote , along the vale decay !</l>
     <l n="27">Yet , why with these compar 'd ? What tints so fine ,</l>
     <l n="28">What sweetness , mildness , can be match 'd with thine ?</l>
     <l n="29">Why roam abroad , since recollection true</l>
     <l n="30">Restores the lovely form to fancy 's view ?</l>
     <l n="31">Still let me gaze , and every care beguile ,</l>
     <l n="32">Gaze on that cheek , where all the Graces smile ;</l>
     <l n="33">That soul-expressing eye , benignly bright ,</l>
     <l n="34">Where meekness beams ineffable delight ;</l>
     <l n="35">That brow , where wisdom sits enthron 'd serene ,</l>
     <l n="36">Each feature forms , and dignifies the mien :</l>
     <l n="37">Still let me listen , while her words impart</l>
     <l n="38">The sweet effusions of the blameless heart ,</l>
     <l n="39">Till all my soul , each tumult charm 'd away ,</l>
     <l n="40">Yields , gently led , to Virtue 's easy sway .</l>
     <l n="41">By thee inspir 'd , O Virtue , age is young ,</l>
     <l n="42">And music warbles from the faltering tongue :</l>
     <l n="43">Thy ray creative cheers the clouded brow ,</l>
     <l n="44">And decks the faded cheek with rosy glow ,</l>
     <l n="45">Brightens the joyless aspect , and supplies</l>
     <l n="46">Pure heavenly lustre to the languid eyes :</l>
     <l n="47">But when youth 's living bloom reflects thy beams ,</l>
     <l n="48">Resistless on the view the glory streams ;</l>
     <l n="49">Love , wonder , joy , alternately alarm ,</l>
     <l n="50">And beauty dazzles with angelic charm .</l>
     <l n="51">Ah , whither fled ! ye dear illusions stay !</l>
     <l n="52">Lo , pale and silent lies the lovely clay .</l>
     <l n="53">How are the roses on that cheek decay 'd ,</l>
     <l n="54">Which late the purple light of youth display 'd !</l>
     <l n="55">Health on her form each sprightly grace bestow 'd ;</l>
     <l n="56">With life and thought each speaking feature glow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="57">Fair was the blossom , soft the vernal sky ;</l>
     <l n="58">Elate with hope , we deem 'd no tempest nigh :</l>
     <l n="59">When lo , a whirlwind 's instantaneous gust</l>
     <l n="60">Left all its beauties withering in the dust .</l>
     <l n="61">Cold the soft hand , that sooth 'd Woe 's weary head !</l>
     <l n="62">And quench 'd the eye , the pitying tear that shed !</l>
     <l n="63">And mute the voice , whose pleasing accents stole ,</l>
     <l n="64">Infusing balm , into the rankled soul !</l>
     <l n="65">O Death , why arm with cruelty thy power ,</l>
     <l n="66">And spare the idle weed , yet lop the flower !</l>
     <l n="67">Why fly thy shafts in lawless error driven !</l>
     <l n="68">Is Virtue then no more the care of Heaven !</l>
     <l n="69">But peace , bold thought ! be still , my bursting heart !</l>
     <l n="70">We , not Eliza , felt the fatal dart .</l>
     <l n="71">Escap 'd the dungeon , does the slave complain ,</l>
     <l n="72">Nor bless the friendly hand that broke the chain ?</l>
     <l n="73">Say , pines not Virtue for the lingering morn ,</l>
     <l n="74">On this dark wild condemn 'd to roam forlorn ?</l>
     <l n="75">Where Reason 's meteor-rays , with sickly glow ,</l>
     <l n="76">O'er the dun gloom a dreadful glimmering throw ;</l>
     <l n="77">Disclosing dubious to th ’ affrighted eye</l>
     <l n="78">O'erwhelming mountains tottering from on high ,</l>
     <l n="79">Black billowy deeps in storms perpetual toss 'd ,</l>
     <l n="80">And weary ways in wildering labyrinths lost ?</l>
     <l n="81">O happy stroke , that bursts the bonds of clay ,</l>
     <l n="82">Darts through the rending gloom the blaze of day ,</l>
     <l n="83">And wings the soul with boundless flight to soar ,</l>
     <l n="84">Where dangers threat , and fears alarm no more .</l>
     <l n="85">Transporting thought ! here let me wipe away</l>
     <l n="86">The tear of grief , and wake a bolder lay .</l>
     <l n="87">But ah ! the swimming eye o'erflows anew ;</l>
     <l n="88">Nor check the sacred drops to pity due :</l>
     <l n="89">Lo , where in speechless , hopeless anguish , bend</l>
     <l n="90">O'er her lov 'd dust , the parent , brother , friend !</l>
     <l n="91">How vain the hope of man ! but cease thy strain ,</l>
     <l n="92">Nor sorrow 's dread solemnity profane ;</l>
     <l n="93">Mix 'd with yon drooping mourners , on her bier</l>
     <l n="94">In silence shed the sympathetic tear .</l>

    <head>THE BATTLE OF THE PIGMIES AND CRANES .</head>
    <head>FROM THE PYGMAEO-GERANO-MACHIA OF ADDISON .</head>
     <l n="1">The pigmy-people , and the feather 'd train ,</l>
     <l n="2">Mingling in mortal combat on the plain ,</l>
     <l n="3">I sing . Ye Muses , favour my designs ,</l>
     <l n="4">Lead on my squadrons , and arrange the lines ;</l>
     <l n="5">The flashing swords and fluttering wings display ,</l>
     <l n="6">And long bills nibbling in the bloody fray ;</l>
     <l n="7">Cranes darting with disdain on tiny foes ,</l>
     <l n="8">Conflicting birds and men , and war 's unnumber 'd woes .</l>
     <l n="9">The wars and woes of heroes six feet long</l>
     <l n="10">Have oft resounded in Pierian song .</l>
     <l n="11">Who has not heard of Colchos ’ golden fleece ,</l>
     <l n="12">And Argo mann 'd with all the flower of Greece ?</l>
     <l n="13">Of Thebes ’ fell brethren , Theseus stern of face ,</l>
     <l n="14">And Peleus ’ son , unrivall 'd in the race ;</l>
     <l n="15">AEneas , founder of the Roman line ,</l>
     <l n="16">And William , glorious on the banks of Boyne ?</l>
     <l n="17">Who has not learn 'd to weep at Pompey 's woes ,</l>
     <l n="18">And over Blackmore 's epic page to doze ?</l>
     <l n="19">‘ Tis I , who dare attempt unusual strains ,</l>
     <l n="20">Of hosts unsung , and unfrequented plains ;</l>
     <l n="21">The small shrill trump , and chiefs of little size ,</l>
     <l n="22">And armies rushing down the darken 'd skies .</l>
     <l n="23">Where India reddens to the early dawn ,</l>
     <l n="24">Winds a deep vale from vulgar eye withdrawn ;</l>
     <l n="25">Bosom 'd in groves the lowly region lies ,</l>
     <l n="26">And rocky mountains round the border rise .</l>
     <l n="27">Here , till the doom of fate its fall decreed ,</l>
     <l n="28">The empire flourish 'd of the pigmy-breed ;</l>
     <l n="29">Here Industry perform 'd , and Genius plann 'd ,</l>
     <l n="30">And busy multitudes o'erspread the land .</l>
     <l n="31">But now to these lone bounds if pilgrim stray ,</l>
     <l n="32">Tempting through craggy cliffs the desperate way ,</l>
     <l n="33">He finds the puny mansion fallen to earth ,</l>
     <l n="34">Its godlings mouldering on th ’ abandon 'd hearth ;</l>
     <l n="35">And starts , where small white bones are spread around ,</l>
     <l n="36">“ Or little footsteps lightly print the ground ; ”</l>
     <l n="37">While the proud crane her nest securely builds ,</l>
     <l n="38">Chattering amid the desolated fields .</l>
     <l n="39">But different fates befell her hostile rage ,</l>
     <l n="40">While reign 'd , invincible through many an age ,</l>
     <l n="41">The dreaded pigmy : rous 'd by war 's alarms ,</l>
     <l n="42">Forth rush 'd the madding manikin to arms .</l>
     <l n="43">Fierce to the field of death the hero flies ;</l>
     <l n="44">The faint crane fluttering flaps the ground , and dies ;</l>
     <l n="45">And by the victor borne ( o'erwhelming load ! )</l>
     <l n="46">With bloody bill loose-dangling marks the road .</l>
     <l n="47">And oft the wily dwarf in ambush lay ,</l>
     <l n="48">And often made the callow young his prey ;</l>
     <l n="49">With slaughter 'd victims heap 'd his board , and smil 'd ,</l>
     <l n="50">T ’ avenge the parent 's trespass on the child .</l>
     <l n="51">Oft , where his feather 'd foe had rear 'd her nest ,</l>
     <l n="52">And laid her eggs and household gods to rest ,</l>
     <l n="53">Burning for blood , in terrible array ,</l>
     <l n="54">The eighteen-inch militia burst their way ;</l>
     <l n="55">All went to wreck ; the infant foeman fell ,</l>
     <l n="56">When scarce his chirping bill had broke the shell .</l>
     <l n="57">Loud uproar hence , and rage of arms arose ,</l>
     <l n="58">And the fell rancour of encountering foes ;</l>
     <l n="59">Hence dwarfs and cranes one general havoc whelms ,</l>
     <l n="60">And Death 's grim visage scares the pigmy-realms .</l>
     <l n="61">Not half so furious blaz 'd the warlike fire</l>
     <l n="62">Of mice , high theme of the Meonian lyre ;</l>
     <l n="63">When bold to battle march 'd the accoutred frogs ,</l>
     <l n="64">And the deep tumult thunder 'd through the bogs .</l>
     <l n="65">Pierc 'd by the javelin bulrush on the shore</l>
     <l n="66">Here agonizing roll 'd the mouse in gore ;</l>
     <l n="67">And there the frog , ( a scene full sad to see ! )</l>
     <l n="68">Shorn of one leg , slow sprawl 'd along on three :</l>
     <l n="69">He vaults no more with vigorous hops on high ,</l>
     <l n="70">But mourns in hoarsest croaks his destiny .</l>
     <l n="71">And now the day of woe drew on apace ,</l>
     <l n="72">A day of woe to all the pigmy-race ,</l>
     <l n="73">When dwarfs were doom 'd ( but penitence was vain )</l>
     <l n="74">To rue each broken egg , and chicken slain .</l>
     <l n="75">For , roused to vengeance by repeated wrong ,</l>
     <l n="76">From distant climes the long-bill 'd legions throng :</l>
     <l n="77">From Strymon 's lake , Cayster 's plashy meads ,</l>
     <l n="78">And fens of Scythia , green with rustling reeds ,</l>
     <l n="79">From where the Danube winds through many a land ,</l>
     <l n="80">And Mareotis laves th ’ Egyptian strand ,</l>
     <l n="81">To rendezvous they waft on eager wing ,</l>
     <l n="82">And wait assembled the returning spring .</l>
     <l n="83">Meanwhile they trim their plumes for length of flight ,</l>
     <l n="84">Whet their keen beaks and twisting claws for fight ;</l>
     <l n="85">Each crane the pigmy power in thought o'erturns ,</l>
     <l n="86">And every bosom for the battle burns .</l>
     <l n="87">When genial gales the frozen air unbind ,</l>
     <l n="88">The screaming legions wheel , and mount the wind :</l>
     <l n="89">Far in the sky they form their long array ,</l>
     <l n="90">And land and ocean stretch 'd immense survey</l>
     <l n="91">Deep deep beneath : and , triumphing in pride ,</l>
     <l n="92">With clouds and winds commix 'd , innumerous ride ;</l>
     <l n="93">‘ Tis wild obstreperous clangour all , and heaven</l>
     <l n="94">Whirls in tempestuous undulation driven .</l>
     <l n="95">Nor less th ’ alarm that shook the world below ,</l>
     <l n="96">Where march 'd in pomp of war th ’ embattled foe :</l>
     <l n="97">Where manikins with haughty step advance ,</l>
     <l n="98">And grasp the shield , and couch the quivering lance :</l>
     <l n="99">To right and left the lengthening lines they form ,</l>
     <l n="100">And rank 'd in deep array await the storm .</l>
     <l n="101">High in the midst the chieftain-dwarf was seen ,</l>
     <l n="102">Of giant stature , and imperial mien :</l>
     <l n="103">Full twenty inches tall he strode along ,</l>
     <l n="104">And view 'd with lofty eye the wondering throng :</l>
     <l n="105">And while with many a scar his visage frown 'd ,</l>
     <l n="106">Bared his broad bosom , rough with many a wound</l>
     <l n="107">Of beaks and claws , disclosing to their sight</l>
     <l n="108">The glorious meed of high heroic might :</l>
     <l n="109">For with insatiate vengeance , he pursued ,</l>
     <l n="110">And never-ending hate , the feathery brood .</l>
     <l n="111">Unhappy they , confiding in the length</l>
     <l n="112">Of horny beak , or talon 's crooked strength ,</l>
     <l n="113">Who durst abide his rage ; the blade descends ,</l>
     <l n="114">And from the panting trunk the pinion rends :</l>
     <l n="115">Laid low in dust the pinion waves no more ,</l>
     <l n="116">The trunk disfigur 'd stiffens in its gore .</l>
     <l n="117">What hosts of heroes fell beneath his force !</l>
     <l n="118">What heaps of chicken carnage mark 'd his course !</l>
     <l n="119">How oft , O Strymon , thy lone banks along ,</l>
     <l n="120">Did wailing Echo waft the funeral song !</l>
     <l n="121">And now from far the mingling clamours rise ,</l>
     <l n="122">Loud and more loud rebounding through the skies .</l>
     <l n="123">From skirt to skirt of heaven , with stormy sway ,</l>
     <l n="124">A cloud rolls on , and darkens all the day .</l>
     <l n="125">Near and more near descends the dreadful shade ;</l>
     <l n="126">And now in battalions array display 'd ,</l>
     <l n="127">On sounding wings , and screaming in their ire ,</l>
     <l n="128">The cranes rush onward , and the fight require .</l>
     <l n="129">The pigmy warriors eye with fearless glare</l>
     <l n="130">The host thick swarming o'er the burden 'd air :</l>
     <l n="131">Thick swarming now , but to their native land</l>
     <l n="132">Doom 'd to return a scanty straggling band —</l>
     <l n="133">When sudden , darting down the depth of heaven ,</l>
     <l n="134">Fierce on th ’ expecting foe the cranes are driven .</l>
     <l n="135">The kindling frenzy every bosom warms ,</l>
     <l n="136">The region echoes to the crash of arms :</l>
     <l n="137">Loose feathers from th ’ encountering armies fly ,</l>
     <l n="138">And in careering whirlwinds mount the sky .</l>
     <l n="139">To breathe from toil upsprings the panting crane ,</l>
     <l n="140">Then with fresh vigour downward darts again .</l>
     <l n="141">Success in equal balance hovering hangs .</l>
     <l n="142">Here , on the sharp spear , mad with mortal pangs ,</l>
     <l n="143">The bird transfix 'd in bloody vortex whirls ,</l>
     <l n="144">Yet fierce in death the threatening talon curls :</l>
     <l n="145">There , while the life-blood bubbles from his wound ,</l>
     <l n="146">With little feet the pigmy beats the ground ;</l>
     <l n="147">Deep from his breast the short , short sob he draws ,</l>
     <l n="148">And dying curses the keen pointed claws .</l>
     <l n="149">Trembles the thundering field , thick cover 'd o'er</l>
     <l n="150">With falchions , mangled wings , and streaming gore ,</l>
     <l n="151">And pigmy arms , and beaks of ample size ,</l>
     <l n="152">And here a claw , and there a finger lies .</l>
     <l n="153">Encompass 'd round with heaps of slaughter 'd foes ,</l>
     <l n="154">All grim in blood the pigmy champion glows ,</l>
     <l n="155">And on th ’ assailing host impetuous springs ,</l>
     <l n="156">Careless of nibbling bills , and flapping wings ;</l>
     <l n="157">And midst the tumult , wheresoe'er he turns ,</l>
     <l n="158">The battle with redoubled fury burns .</l>
     <l n="159">From every side th ’ avenging cranes amain</l>
     <l n="160">Throng , to o'erwhelm this terror of the plain :</l>
     <l n="161">When suddenly ( for such the will of Jove )</l>
     <l n="162">A fowl enormous , sousing from above ,</l>
     <l n="163">The gallant chieftain clutch 'd , and , soaring high ,</l>
     <l n="164">( Sad chance of battle ! ) bore him up the sky .</l>
     <l n="165">The cranes pursue , and clustering in a ring ,</l>
     <l n="166">Chatter triumphant round the captive king .</l>
     <l n="167">But ah ! what pangs each pigmy bosom wrung ,</l>
     <l n="168">When , now to cranes a prey , on talons hung ,</l>
     <l n="169">High in the clouds they saw their helpless lord ,</l>
     <l n="170">His wriggling form still lessening as he soar 'd .</l>
     <l n="171">Lo ! yet again , with unabated rage ,</l>
     <l n="172">In mortal strife the mingling hosts engage .</l>
     <l n="173">The crane with darted bill assaults the foe ,</l>
     <l n="174">Hovering ; then wheels aloft to scape the blow :</l>
     <l n="175">The dwarf in anguish aims the vengeful wound ;</l>
     <l n="176">But whirls in empty air the falchion round .</l>
     <l n="177">Such was the scene , when midst the loud alarms</l>
     <l n="178">Sublime th ’ eternal Thunderer rose in arms :</l>
     <l n="179">When Briareus , by mad ambition driven ,</l>
     <l n="180">Heav 'd Pelion huge , and hurl 'd it high at heaven .</l>
     <l n="181">Jove roll 'd redoubling thunders from on high ,</l>
     <l n="182">Mountains and bolts encounter 'd in the sky ;</l>
     <l n="183">Till one stupendous ruin whelm 'd the crew ,</l>
     <l n="184">Their vast limbs weltering wide in brimstone blue .</l>
     <l n="185">But now at length the pigmy legions yield ,</l>
     <l n="186">And wing 'd with terror fly the fatal field .</l>
     <l n="187">They raise a weak and melancholy wail ,</l>
     <l n="188">All in distraction scattering o'er the vale .</l>
     <l n="189">Prone on their routed rear the cranes descend ;</l>
     <l n="190">Their bills bite furious , and their talons rend :</l>
     <l n="191">With unrelenting ire they urge the chase ,</l>
     <l n="192">Sworn to exterminate the hated race .</l>
     <l n="193">‘ Twas thus the pigmy name , once great in war ,</l>
     <l n="194">For spoils of conquer 'd cranes renown 'd afar ,</l>
     <l n="195">Perish 'd . For , by the dread decree of Heaven ,</l>
     <l n="196">Short is the date to earthly grandeur given ,</l>
     <l n="197">And vain are all attempts to roam beyond</l>
     <l n="198">Where fate has fix 'd the everlasting bound .</l>
     <l n="199">Fall'n are the trophies of Assyrian power ,</l>

     <l n="201">Yea , though to both superior far in fame ,</l>
     <l n="202">Thine empire , Latium , is an empty name .</l>
     <l n="203">And now with lofty chiefs of ancient time</l>

     <l n="205">Or , if belief to matron-tales be due ,</l>
     <l n="206">Full oft , in the belated shepherd 's view ,</l>
     <l n="207">Their frisking forms , in gentle green array 'd ,</l>

     <l n="27">The beagle 's breast with ardour burns ,</l>
     <l n="28">The bounding steed the champaign spurns ,</l>
     <l n="29">And Fancy oft the game descries</l>
     <l n="30">Through the hound 's nose , and huntsman 's eyes .</l>
     <l n="31">Just then , a council of the hares</l>
     <l n="32">Had met , on national affairs .</l>
     <l n="33">The chiefs were set ; while o'er their head</l>
     <l n="34">The furze its frizzled covering spread .</l>
     <l n="35">Long lists of grievances were heard ,</l>
     <l n="36">And general discontent appear 'd .</l>
     <l n="37">“ Our harmless race shall every savage</l>
     <l n="38">Both quadruped and biped ravage ?</l>
     <l n="39">Shall horses , hounds , and hunters still</l>
     <l n="40">Unite their wits to work us ill ?</l>
     <l n="41">The youth , his parent 's sole delight ,</l>
     <l n="42">Whose tooth the dewy lawns invite ,</l>
     <l n="43">Whose pulse in every vein beats strong ,</l>
     <l n="44">Whose limbs leap light the vales along ,</l>
     <l n="45">May yet ere noontide meet his death ,</l>
     <l n="46">And lie dismember 'd on the heath .</l>
     <l n="47">For youth , alas , nor cautious age ,</l>
     <l n="48">Nor strength , nor speed , eludes their rage .</l>
     <l n="49">In every field we meet the foe ,</l>
     <l n="50">Each gale comes fraught with sounds of woe ;</l>
     <l n="51">The morning but awakes our fears ,</l>
     <l n="52">The evening sees us bath 'd in tears .</l>

     <l n="59">No foes are weak , whom Justice arms ,</l>
     <l n="60">Whom Concord leads , and Hatred warms .</l>

     <l n="62">Or in the great attempt expire . ”</l>

     <l n="65">The fire of vengeance seem 'd to stream</l>
     <l n="66">From his swoln eyeball 's yellow gleam .</l>
     <l n="67">And now the tumults of the war ,</l>
     <l n="68">Mingling confusedly from afar ,</l>
     <l n="69">Swell in the wind . Now louder cries</l>
     <l n="70">Distinct of hounds and men arise .</l>
     <l n="71">Forth from the brake , with beating heart ,</l>
     <l n="72">Th ’ assembled hares tumultuous start ,</l>
     <l n="73">And , every straining nerve on wing ,</l>
     <l n="74">Away precipitately spring .</l>
     <l n="75">The hunting band , a signal given ,</l>
     <l n="76">Thick thundering o'er the plain are driven ;</l>
     <l n="77">O'er cliff abrupt , and shrubby mound ,</l>
     <l n="78">And river broad , impetuous bound :</l>
     <l n="79">Now plunge amid the forest shades ,</l>
     <l n="80">Glance through the openings of the glades ;</l>
     <l n="81">Now o'er the level valley sweep ,</l>
     <l n="82">Now with short steps strain up the steep ;</l>
     <l n="83">While backward from the hunter 's eyes</l>
     <l n="84">The landscape like a torrent flies .</l>
     <l n="85">At last an ancient wood they gain 'd ,</l>
     <l n="86">By pruner 's axe yet unprofan 'd .</l>
     <l n="87">High o'er the rest , by Nature rear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="88">The oak 's majestic boughs appear 'd :</l>
     <l n="89">Beneath , a copse of various hue</l>
     <l n="90">In barbarous luxuriance grew .</l>
     <l n="91">No knife had curb 'd the rambling sprays ,</l>
     <l n="92">No hand had wove th ’ implicit maze .</l>
     <l n="93">The flowering thorn , self-taught to wind ,</l>
     <l n="94">The hazel 's stubborn stem entwin 'd ,</l>
     <l n="95">And bramble twigs were wreath 'd around ,</l>
     <l n="96">And rough furze crept along the ground .</l>
     <l n="97">Here sheltering , from the sons of murther ,</l>
     <l n="98">The hares drag their tir 'd limbs no further .</l>
     <l n="99">But lo , the western wind ere long</l>
     <l n="100">Was loud , and roar 'd the woods among ;</l>
     <l n="101">From rustling leaves , and crashing boughs</l>
     <l n="102">The sound of woe and war arose .</l>
     <l n="103">The hares distracted scour the grove ,</l>
     <l n="104">As terror and amazement drove ;</l>
     <l n="105">But danger , wheresoe'er they fled ,</l>
     <l n="106">Still seem 'd impending o'er their head .</l>
     <l n="107">Now crowded in a grotto 's gloom ,</l>
     <l n="108">All hope extinct , they wait their doom .</l>
     <l n="109">Dire was the silence , till , at length ,</l>
     <l n="110">Even from despair deriving strength ,</l>
     <l n="111">With bloody eye and furious look ,</l>
     <l n="112">A daring youth arose and spoke .</l>
     <l n="113">“ O wretched race , the scorn of Fate ,</l>
     <l n="114">Whom ills of every sort await !</l>
     <l n="115">O , curs 'd with keenest sense to feel</l>
     <l n="116">The sharpest sting of every ill !</l>
     <l n="117">Say ye , who , fraught with mighty scheme ,</l>
     <l n="118">Of liberty and vengeance dream ,</l>
     <l n="119">What now remains ? To what recess</l>
     <l n="120">Shall we our weary steps address ,</l>
     <l n="121">Since Fate is evermore pursuing</l>
     <l n="122">All ways and means to work our ruin ?</l>

     <l n="124">Condemn 'd to misery worse than death ?</l>
     <l n="125">Must we , with fruitless labour , strive</l>
     <l n="126">In misery worse than death to live ?</l>
     <l n="127">No . Be the smaller ill our choice :</l>

     <l n="131">Thus while he spoke , his words impart</l>
     <l n="132">The dire resolve to every heart .</l>
     <l n="133">A distant lake in prospect lay ,</l>
     <l n="134">That , glittering in the solar ray ,</l>
     <l n="135">Gleam 'd through the dusky trees , and shot</l>
     <l n="136">A trembling light along the grot .</l>
     <l n="137">Thither with one consent they bend ,</l>
     <l n="138">Their sorrows with their lives to end ,</l>
     <l n="139">While each , in thought , already hears</l>
     <l n="140">The water hissing in his ears .</l>
     <l n="141">Fast by the margin of the lake ,</l>
     <l n="142">Conceal 'd within a thorny brake ,</l>
     <l n="143">A linnet sate , whose careless lay</l>
     <l n="144">Amus 'd the solitary day .</l>
     <l n="145">Careless he sung , for on his breast</l>
     <l n="146">Sorrow no lasting trace impress 'd ;</l>
     <l n="147">When suddenly he heard a sound</l>
     <l n="148">Of swift feet traversing the ground .</l>
     <l n="149">Quick to the neighbouring tree he flies ,</l>
     <l n="150">Thence trembling casts around his eyes ;</l>
     <l n="151">No foe appear 'd , his fears were vain ;</l>
     <l n="152">Pleas 'd he renews the sprightly strain .</l>
     <l n="153">The hares , whose noise had caus 'd his fright ,</l>
     <l n="154">Saw with surprise the linnet 's flight .</l>
     <l n="155">“ Is there on Earth a wretch , ” they said ,</l>
     <l n="156">“ Whom our approach can strike with dread ? ”</l>
     <l n="157">An instantaneous change of thought</l>
     <l n="158">To tumult every bosom wrought .</l>
     <l n="159">So fares the system-building sage ,</l>
     <l n="160">Who , plodding on from youth to age ,</l>
     <l n="161">At last on some foundation-dream</l>
     <l n="162">Has rear 'd aloft his goodly scheme ,</l>
     <l n="163">And prov 'd his predecessors fools ,</l>
     <l n="164">And bound all nature by his rules ;</l>
     <l n="165">So fares he in that dreadful hour ,</l>
     <l n="166">When injur 'd Truth exerts her power ,</l>
     <l n="167">Some new phenomenon to raise ,</l>
     <l n="168">Which , bursting on his frighted gaze ,</l>
     <l n="169">From its proud summit to the ground</l>
     <l n="170">Proves the whole edifice unsound .</l>
     <l n="171">“ Children , ” thus spoke a hare sedate ,</l>
     <l n="172">Who oft had known th ’ extremes of fate ,</l>
     <l n="173">“ In slight events the docile mind</l>
     <l n="174">May hints of good instruction find .</l>
     <l n="175">That our condition is the worst ,</l>
     <l n="176">And we with such misfortunes curst</l>
     <l n="177">As all comparison defy ,</l>
     <l n="178">Was late the universal cry ;</l>
     <l n="179">When lo , an accident so slight</l>
     <l n="180">As yonder little linnet 's flight</l>
     <l n="181">Has made your stubborn heart confess</l>
     <l n="182">( So your amazement bids me guess )</l>
     <l n="183">That all our load of woes and fears</l>

     <l n="186">Whom even a helpless hare alarms ?</l>
     <l n="187">Yet he repines not at his lot ,</l>
     <l n="188">When past , the danger is forgot :</l>
     <l n="189">On yonder bough he trims his wings ,</l>
     <l n="190">And with unusual rapture sings :</l>
     <l n="191">While we , less wretched , sink beneath</l>
     <l n="192">Our lighter ills , and rush to death .</l>
     <l n="193">No more of this unmeaning rage ,</l>
     <l n="194">But hear , my friends , the words of age .</l>
     <l n="195">“ When by the winds of autumn driven</l>
     <l n="196">The scatter 'd clouds fly cross the heaven ,</l>
     <l n="197">Oft have we , from some mountain 's head ,</l>
     <l n="198">Beheld th ’ alternate light and shade</l>
     <l n="199">Sweep the long vale . Here , hovering , lowers</l>
     <l n="200">The shadowy cloud ; there downward pours ,</l>
     <l n="201">Streaming direct , a flood of day ,</l>
     <l n="202">Which from the view flies swift away ;</l>
     <l n="203">It flies , while other shades advance ,</l>
     <l n="204">And other streaks of sunshine glance .</l>
     <l n="205">Thus chequer 'd is the life below</l>
     <l n="206">With gleams of joy and clouds of woe .</l>
     <l n="207">Then hope not , while we journey on ,</l>
     <l n="208">Still to be basking in the sun :</l>
     <l n="209">Nor fear , though now in shades ye mourn ,</l>
     <l n="210">That sunshine will no more return .</l>
     <l n="211">If , by your terrors overcome ,</l>
     <l n="212">Ye fly before th ’ approaching gloom ,</l>
     <l n="213">The rapid clouds your flight pursue ,</l>
     <l n="214">And darkness still o'ercasts your view .</l>
     <l n="215">Who longs to reach the radiant plain</l>
     <l n="216">Must onward urge his course amain ;</l>
     <l n="217">For doubly swift the shadow flies ,</l>
     <l n="218">When ‘ gainst the gale the pilgrim plies .</l>
     <l n="219">At least be firm , and undismay 'd</l>
     <l n="220">Maintain your ground ; the fleeting shade</l>
     <l n="221">Ere long spontaneous glides away ,</l>
     <l n="222">And gives you back th ’ enlivening ray .</l>
     <l n="223">Lo , while I speak , our danger past !</l>
     <l n="224">No more the shrill horn 's angry blast</l>
     <l n="225">Howls in our ear ; the savage roar</l>
     <l n="226">Of war and murder is no more .</l>
     <l n="227">Then snatch the moment fate allows ,</l>
     <l n="228">Nor think of past or future woes . ”</l>
     <l n="229">He spoke ; and hope revives ; the lake</l>
     <l n="230">That instant one and all forsake ,</l>
     <l n="231">In sweet amusement to employ</l>
     <l n="232">The present sprightly hour of joy .</l>
     <l n="233">Now from the western mountain 's brow ,</l>
     <l n="234">Compass 'd with clouds of various glow ,</l>
     <l n="235">The sun a broader orb displays ,</l>
     <l n="236">And shoots aslope his ruddy rays .</l>
     <l n="237">The lawn assumes a fresher green ,</l>
     <l n="238">And dewdrops spangle all the scene ;</l>
     <l n="239">The balmy zephyr breathes along ,</l>
     <l n="240">The shepherd sings his tender song ,</l>
     <l n="241">With all their lays the groves resound ,</l>
     <l n="242">And falling waters murmur round .</l>
     <l n="243">Discord and care were put to flight ,</l>
     <l n="244">And all was peace , and calm delight .</l>

    <head>THE WOLF AND SHEPHERDS .</head>
    <head>A FABLE .</head>
     <l n="1">Laws , as we read in ancient sages ,</l>
     <l n="2">Have been like cobwebs in all ages .</l>
     <l n="3">Cobwebs for little flies are spread ,</l>
     <l n="4">And laws for little folks are made ;</l>
     <l n="5">But if an insect of renown ,</l>
     <l n="6">Hornet or beetle , wasp or drone ,</l>
     <l n="7">Be caught in quest of sport or plunder ,</l>
     <l n="8">The flimsy fetter flies in sunder .</l>
     <l n="9">Your simile perhaps may please one</l>
     <l n="10">With whom wit holds the place of reason :</l>
     <l n="11">But can you prove that this in fact is</l>
     <l n="12">Agreeable to life and practice ?</l>
     <l n="13">Then hear , what in his simple way</l>
     <l n="14">Old Esop told me t'other day .</l>
     <l n="15">In days of yore , but ( which is very odd )</l>
     <l n="16">Our author mentions not the period ,</l>
     <l n="17">We mortal men , less given to speeches ,</l>
     <l n="18">Allow 'd the beasts sometimes to teach us .</l>
     <l n="19">But now we all are prattlers grown ,</l>
     <l n="20">And suffer no voice but our own :</l>
     <l n="21">With us no beast has leave to speak ,</l>
     <l n="22">Although his honest heart should break .</l>
     <l n="23">‘ Tis true , your asses and your apes ,</l>
     <l n="24">And other brutes in human shapes ,</l>
     <l n="25">And that thing made of sound and show</l>
     <l n="26">Which mortals have misnam 'd a beau</l>
     <l n="27">( But in the language of the sky</l>
     <l n="28">Is call 'd a two-legg 'd butterfly ) ,</l>
     <l n="29">Will make your very heartstrings ache</l>
     <l n="30">With loud and everlasting clack ,</l>
     <l n="31">And beat your auditory drum ,</l>
     <l n="32">Till you grow deaf , or they grow dumb .</l>
     <l n="33">But to our story we return :</l>
     <l n="34">‘ Twas early on a Summer morn ,</l>
     <l n="35">A Wolf forsook the mountain-den ,</l>
     <l n="36">And issued hungry on the plain .</l>
     <l n="37">Full many a stream and lawn he pass 'd ,</l>
     <l n="38">And reach 'd a winding vale at last ;</l>
     <l n="39">Where from a hollow rock he spy 'd</l>
     <l n="40">The shepherds drest in flowery pride .</l>
     <l n="41">Garlands were strow 'd , and all was gay ,</l>
     <l n="42">To celebrate an holiday .</l>
     <l n="43">The merry tabor 's gamesome sound</l>
     <l n="44">Provok 'd the sprightly dance around .</l>
     <l n="45">Hard by a rural board was rear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="46">On which in fair array appear 'd</l>
     <l n="47">The peach , the apple , and the raisin ,</l>
     <l n="48">And all the fruitage of the season .</l>
     <l n="49">But , more distinguish 'd than the rest ,</l>
     <l n="50">Was seen a wether ready drest ,</l>
     <l n="51">That smoking , recent from the flame ,</l>
     <l n="52">Diffus 'd a stomach-rousing steam .</l>
     <l n="53">Our wolf could not endure the sight ,</l>
     <l n="54">Outrageous grew his appetite :</l>
     <l n="55">His entrails groan 'd with tenfold pain ,</l>
     <l n="56">He lick 'd his lips , and lick 'd again ;</l>
     <l n="57">At last , with lightning in his eyes ,</l>
     <l n="58">He bounces forth , and fiercely cries ,</l>
     <l n="59">“ Shepherds , I am not given to scolding ,</l>
     <l n="60">But now my spleen I cannot hold in .</l>
     <l n="61">By Jove , such scandalous oppression</l>
     <l n="62">Would put an elephant in passion .</l>
     <l n="63">You , who your flocks ( as you pretend )</l>
     <l n="64">By wholesome laws from harm defend ,</l>
     <l n="65">Which make it death for any beast ,</l>
     <l n="66">How much soe'er by hunger press 'd ,</l>
     <l n="67">To seize a sheep by force or stealth ,</l>
     <l n="68">For sheep have right to life and health ;</l>
     <l n="69">Can you commit , uncheck 'd by shame ,</l>
     <l n="70">What in a beast so much you blame ?</l>
     <l n="71">What is a law , if those who make it</l>
     <l n="72">Become the forwardest to break it ?</l>
     <l n="73">The case is plain : you would reserve</l>
     <l n="74">All to yourselves , while others starve .</l>
     <l n="75">Such laws from base self-interest spring ,</l>
     <l n="76">Not from the reason of the thing — ”</l>
     <l n="77">He was proceeding , when a swain</l>
     <l n="78">Burst out — “ And dares a wolf arraign</l>
     <l n="79">His betters , and condemn their measures ,</l>
     <l n="80">And contradict their wills and pleasures ?</l>
     <l n="81">We have establish 'd laws , ‘ tis true ,</l>
     <l n="82">But laws are made for such as you .</l>
     <l n="83">Know , sirrah , in its very nature</l>
     <l n="84">A law can n't reach the legislature .</l>
     <l n="85">For laws , without a sanction join 'd ,</l>
     <l n="86">As all men know , can never bind :</l>
     <l n="87">But sanctions reach not us the makers ,</l>
     <l n="88">For who dares punish us though breakers ?</l>
     <l n="89">‘ Tis therefore plain , beyond denial ,</l>
     <l n="90">That laws were ne'er design 'd to tie all ;</l>
     <l n="91">But those , whom sanctions reach alone ;</l>
     <l n="92">We stand accountable to none .</l>
     <l n="93">Besides , ‘ tis evident , that , seeing</l>
     <l n="94">Laws from the great derive their being ,</l>
     <l n="95">They as in duty bound should love</l>
     <l n="96">The great , in whom they live and move ,</l>
     <l n="97">And humbly yield to their desires :</l>
     <l n="98">‘ Tis just what gratitude requires .</l>
     <l n="99">What suckling dangled on the lap</l>
     <l n="100">Would tear away its mother 's pap ?</l>
     <l n="101">But hold — Why deign I to dispute</l>
     <l n="102">With such a scoundrel of a brute ?</l>
     <l n="103">Logic is lost upon a knave .</l>
     <l n="104">Let action prove the law our slave . ”</l>
     <l n="105">An angry nod his will declar 'd</l>
     <l n="106">To his gruff yeoman of the guard ;</l>
     <l n="107">The full-fed mongrels , train 'd to ravage ,</l>
     <l n="108">Fly to devour the shaggy savage .</l>
     <l n="109">The beast had now no time to lose</l>
     <l n="110">In chopping logic with his foes ;</l>
     <l n="111">“ This argument , ” quoth he , “ has force ,</l>
     <l n="112">And swiftness is my sole resource . ”</l>
     <l n="113">He said , and left the swains their prey ,</l>
     <l n="114">And to the mountains scour 'd away .</l>

   <p>* * * * * * * Lest your Lordship , who are so well acquainted with every thing that relates to true honour , should think hardly of me for attacking the memory of the dead , I beg leave to offer a few words in my own vindication .</p>
   <p>If I had composed the following verses , with a view to gratify private resentment , to promote the interest of any faction , or to recommend myself to the patronage of any person whatsoever , I should have been altogether inexcusable . To attack the memory of the dead from selfish considerations , or from mere wantonness of malice , is an enormity which none can hold in greater detestation than I . But I composed them from very different motives ; as every intelligent reader , who peruses them with attention , and who is willing to believe me upon my own testimony , will undoubtedly perceive . My motives proceeded from a sincere desire to do some small service to my country , and to the cause of truth and virtue . The promoters of faction I ever did , and ever will consider as the enemies of mankind ; to the memory of such I owe no veneration ; to the writings of such I owe no indulgence .</p>
   <p>Your Lordship knows that * * * * * owed the greatest share of his renown to the most incompetent of all judges , the mob ; actuated by the most unworthy of all principles , a spirit of insolence ; and inflamed by the vilest of all human passions , hatred to their fellow-citizens . Those who joined the cry in his favour seemed to me to be swayed rather by fashion than by real sentiment . He therefore might have lived and died unmolested by me ; confident as I am , that posterity , when the present unhappy dissensions are forgotten , will do ample justice to his real character . But when I saw the extravagant honours that were paid to his memory , and heard that a monument in Westminster Abbey was intended for one , whom even his admirers acknowledge to have been an incendiary and a debauchee , I could not help wishing that my countrymen would reflect a little on what they were doing , before they consecrated , by what posterity would think the public voice , a character which no friend to virtue or to true taste can approve . It was this sentiment , enforced by the earnest request of a friend , which produced the following little poem ; in which I have said nothing of * * * * *' s manners that is not warranted by the best authority ; nor of his writings , that is not perfectly agreeable to the opinion of many of the most competent judges in Britain . * * * * * * * *, January 1765 . ]</p>

     <l n="106">Or check in prone career a headlong age .</l>
     <l n="107">Far different themes must animate their song ,</l>

     <l n="128">A deep oblivious lethargy of soul :</l>
     <l n="129">Let rill and gale glide liquidly along ,</l>
     <l n="130">While not one ruffling thought obstructs the song ;</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>It has been observed by some critics , who have treated of pastoral poetry , that , in every poem of this kind , it is proper , that the scene or landscape , connected with the little plot or fable on which the poem is founded , be delineated with at least as much accuracy , as is sufficient to render the description particular and picturesque . How far Virgil has thought fit to attend to such a rule may appear from the remarks which the translator has subjoined to every Pastoral .</p>
   <p>The scene of the first pastoral is pictured out with great accuracy . The shepherds Meliboeus and Tityrus are represented as conversing together beneath a spreading beech tree . Flocks and herds are feeding hard by . At a little distance we behold , on the one hand a great rock , and on the other a fence of flowering willows . The prospect as it widens is diversified with groves , and streams , and some tall trees , particularly elms . Beyond all these appear marshy grounds , and rocky hills . The ragged and drooping flock of the unfortunate shepherd , particularly the she goat which he leads along , are no inconsiderable figures in this picture .— The time is the evening of a summer day , a little before sunset . See the Original , v. 1 , 5 , 9 , 52 , 54 , 67 , 69 , 81 , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>This Pastoral is said to have been written on the following occasion . Augustus , in order to reward the services of his veterans , by means of whom he had established himself in the Roman empire , distributed among them the lands that lay contiguous to Mantua and Cremona . To make way for these intruders , the rightful owners , of whom Virgil was one , were turned out . But our poet , by the intercession of Mecaenas , was reinstated in his possessions . Meliboeus here personates one of the unhappy exiles , and Virgil is represented under the character of Tityrus .</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>The refinements of Taubmannus , De La Cerda , and others , who will have Amaryllis to signify Rome , and Galatea to signify Mantua , have perplexed this passage not a little : if the literal meaning be admitted , the whole becomes obvious and natural .</p>

     <l n="112">What madness thus to waste the fleeting day !</l>
     <l n="113">Be rous 'd at length ; thy half-prun 'd vines demand</l>
     <l n="114">The needful culture of thy curbing hand .</l>
     <l n="115">Haste , lingering swain , the flexile willows weave ,</l>
     <l n="116">And with thy wonted care thy wants relieve .</l>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The chief excellency of this poem consists in its delicacy and simplicity . Corydon addresses his favourite in such a purity of sentiment as one would think might effectually discountenance the prepossessions which generally prevail against the subject of this eclogue . The nature of his affection may easily be ascertained from his ideas of the happiness which he hopes to enjoy in the company of his beloved Alexis .</p>

   <p>It appears to have been no other than that friendship , which was encouraged by the wisest legislators of ancient Greece , as a noble incentive to virtue , and recommended by the example even of Agesilaus , Pericles , and Socrates : an affection wholly distinct from the infamous attachments that prevailed among the licentious . The reader will find a full and satisfying account of this generous passion in Dr. Potter 's Antiquities of Greece , B. iv . chap . 9 . Mons . Bayle , in his Dictionary at the article Virgile , has at great length vindicated our poet from the charge of immorality which the critics have grounded upon this pastoral .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>In this fourth pastoral , no particular landscape is delineated . The whole is a prophetic song of triumph . But as almost all the images and allusions are of the rural kind , it is no less a true bucolic than the others ; if we admit the definition of a pastoral , given us by an author of the first rank , [ A ] who calls it “ A poem in which any action or passion is represented by its effects upon country life . ”</p>
   <p>It is of little importance to inquire on what occasion this poem was written . The spirit of prophetic enthusiasm that breathes through it , and the resemblance it bears in many places to the Oriental manner , make it not improbable , that our poet composed it partly from some pieces of ancient prophecy that might have fallen into his hands , and that he afterwards inscribed it to his friend and patron Pollio , on occasion of the birth of his son Salonius .</p>

Four shepherds , Daphnis in the most distinguished place , Corydon , Thyrsis , and Meliboeus , are seen reclining beneath an holm . Sheep and goats intermixed are feeding hard by . At a little distance Mincius , fringed with reeds , appears winding along . Fields and trees compose the surrounding scene .

The former adopts the soliloquy of a despairing lover : the latter chooses for his subject the magic rites of an enchantress forsaken by her lover , and recalling him by the power of her spells .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>This and the first eclogue seem to have been written on the same occasion . The time is a still evening . The landscape is described at the 97th line of this translation . On one side of the highway is an artificial arbour , where Lycidas invites Moeris to rest a little from the fatigue of his journey : and at a considerable distance appears a sepulchre by the way-side , where the ancient sepulchres were commonly erected .</p>
   <p>The critics with one voice seem to condemn this eclogue as unworthy of its author ; I know not for what good reason . The many beautiful lines scattered through it would , one might think , be no weak recommendation . But it is by no means to be reckoned a loose collection of incoherent fragments ; its principal parts are all strictly connected , and refer to a certain end , and its allusions and images are wholly suited to pastoral life . Its subject , though uncommon , is not improper ; for what is more natural , than that two shepherds , when occasionally mentioning the good qualities of their absent friend , particularly his poetical talents , should repeat such fragments of his songs as they recollected ?</p>
   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>These lines , which Virgil has translated literally from Theocritus , may be supposed to be a fragment of a poem mentioned in the preceding verses ; or , what is more likely , to be spoken by Lycidas to his servant ; something similar to which may be seen Past . 5. v. 20. of this translation .— The original is here remarkably explicit , even to a degree of affectation . This the translator has endeavoured to imitate .</p>

   <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>The scene of this pastoral is very accurately delineated . We behold the forlorn Gallus stretched along beneath a solitary cliff , his flocks standing round him at some distance . A group of deities and swains encircle him , each of whom is particularly described . On one side we see the shepherds with their crooks ; next to them the neatherds , known by the clumsiness of their appearance ; and next to these Menalcas with his clothes wet , as just come from beating or gathering winter-mast . On the other side we observe Apollo with his usual insignia ; Sylvanus crowned with flowers , and brandishing in his hand the long lilies and flowering fennel ; and last of all , Pan , the god of shepherds , known by his ruddy smiling countenance , and the other peculiarities of his form .</p>
   <p>Gallus was a Roman of very considerable rank , a poet of no small estimation , and an intimate friend of Virgil . He loved to distraction one Cytheris ( here called Lycoris ) who slighted him , and followed Antony into Gaul .</p>

     <l n="15">Pale shivering Poverty , that stalk 'd behind ,</l>
     <l n="16">His greasy rags loose fluttering in the wind ,</l>
     <l n="17">And Terror , cudgel-arm 'd , that strode before ,</l>
     <l n="18">Still to my deeds unquestion 'd witness bore .</l>
     <l n="19">Dire execution , as I march 'd , was spread ;</l>
     <l n="20">My threat'ning horn they heard — they heard and fled .</l>
     <l n="21">While thus destruction mark 'd my headlong course ,</l>
     <l n="22">Nor mortals durst oppose my matchless force ,</l>
     <l n="23">A deadly warrant from the court of heaven</l>
     <l n="24">To Death , the sovereign messenger , was given .</l>
     <l n="25">Swift as the lightning 's instantaneous flame ,</l>
     <l n="26">Arm 'd with his dart , the king of catchpoles came .</l>
     <l n="27">My heart , unmov 'd before , was seiz 'd with fear ,</l>
     <l n="28">And sunk beneath his all-subduing spear ;</l>
     <l n="29">To heaven 's high bar the spirit wing 'd its way ,</l>
     <l n="30">And left the carcass forfeit to the clay .</l>
     <l n="31">Reader ! though every ill beset thee round ,</l>
     <l n="32">With patience bear , nor servilely despond ;</l>
     <l n="33">Though heaven awhile delay th ’ impending blow ,</l>
     <l n="34">Heaven sees the sorrows of the world below ,</l>
     <l n="35">And sets at last the suffering mourner free</l>
     <l n="36">From famine , misery , pestilence , and ME .</l>
