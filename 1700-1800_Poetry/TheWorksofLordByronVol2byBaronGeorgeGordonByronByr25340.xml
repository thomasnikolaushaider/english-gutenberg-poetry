    <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME .</head>
    <p n="1">The text of the present edition of Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage is based upon a collation of volume i. of the Library Edition , 1855 , with the following MSS . : ( i . ) the original MS. of the First and Second Cantos , in Byron 's handwriting [ MS. M .] ; ( ii . ) a transcript of the First and Second Cantos , in the handwriting of R. C. Dallas [ D .] ; ( iii . ) a transcript of the Third Canto , in the handwriting of Clara Jane Clairmont [ C .] ; ( iv . ) a collection of “ scraps , ” forming a first draft of the Third Canto , in Byron 's handwriting [ MS .] ; ( v .) a fair copy of the first draft of the Fourth Canto , together with the MS. of the additional stanzas , in Byron 's handwriting . [ MS. M .] ; ( vi . ) a second fair copy of the Fourth Canto , as completed , in Byron 's handwriting [ D .] .</p>
    <p n="2">The text of the First and Second Cantos has also been collated with the text of the First Edition of the First and Second Cantos ( quarto , 1812 ) ; the text of the Third and of the Fourth Cantos with the texts of the First Editions of 1816 and 1818 respectively ; and the text of the entire poem with that issued in the collected editions of 1831 and 1832 .</p>
    <p n="3">Considerations of space have determined the position and arrangement of the notes .</p>
    <p n="4">Byron 's notes to the First , Second , and Third Cantos , and Hobhouse 's notes to the Fourth Canto are printed , according to precedent , at the end of each canto .</p>
    <p n="5">Editorial notes are placed in square brackets . Notes illustrative of the text are printed immediately below the variants . Notes illustrative of Byron 's notes or footnotes are appended to the originals or printed as footnotes . Byron 's own notes to the Fourth Canto are printed as footnotes to the text .</p>
    <p n="6">Hobhouse 's “ Historical Notes ” are reprinted without addition or comment ; but the numerous and intricate references to classical , historical , and archæological authorities have been carefully verified , and in many instances rewritten .</p>
    <p n="7">In compiling the Introductions , the additional notes , and footnotes , I have endeavoured to supply the reader with a compendious manual of reference . With the subject-matter of large portions of the three distinct poems which make up the five hundred stanzas of Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage every one is more or less familiar , but details and particulars are out of the immediate reach of even the most cultivated readers .</p>
    <p n="8">The poem may be dealt with in two ways . It may be regarded as a repertory or treasury of brilliant passages for selection and quotation ; or it may be read continuously , and with some attention to the style and message of the author . It is in the belief that Childe Harold should be read continuously , and that it gains by the closest study , reassuming its original freshness and splendour , that the text as well as Byron 's own notes have been somewhat minutely annotated .</p>
    <p n="9">In the selection and composition of the notes I have , in addition to other authorities , consulted and made use of the following editions of Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage :—</p>
    <p n="10">i. Édition Classique , par James Darmesteter , Docteur-ès-lettres . Paris , 1882 .</p>
    <p n="11">ii . Byron 's Childe Harold , edited , with Introduction and Notes , by H. F. Tozer , M. A . Oxford , 1885 ( Clarendon Press Series ) .</p>
    <p n="12">iii . Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage , edited by the Rev . E. C . Everard Owen , M. A . London , 1897 ( Arnold 's British Classics ) .</p>
    <p n="13">Particular acknowledgments of my indebtedness to these admirable works will be found throughout the volume .</p>
    <p n="14">I have consulted and derived assistance from Professor Eugen Kölbing 's exhaustive collation of the text of the two first cantos with the Dallas Transcript in the British Museum ( Zur Textüberlieferung von Byron 's Childe Harold , Cantos I ., II . Leipsic , 1896 ) ; and I am indebted to the same high authority for information with regard to the Seventh Edition ( 1814 ) of the First and Second Cantos . ( See Bemerkungen zu Byron 's Childe Harold , Engl . Stud ., 1896 , xxi . 176-186 . )</p>
    <p n="15">I have again to record my grateful acknowledgments to Dr. Richard Garnett , C. B ., Dr. A. S. Murray , F. R. S ., Mr. R. E. Graves , Mr. E. D. Butler , F. R. G. S ., and other officials of the British Museum , for constant help and encouragement in the preparation of the notes to Childe Harold .</p>
    <p n="16">I desire to express my thanks to Dr. H. R. Mill , Librarian of the Royal Geographical Society ; Mr. J. C. Baker , F. R. S ., Keeper of the Herbarium and Library of the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew ; Mr. Horatio F. Brown ( author of Venice , an Historical Sketch , etc . ) ; Mr. P. A. Daniel , Mr. Richard Edgcumbe , and others , for valuable information on various points of doubt and difficulty .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF CHILDE HAROLD .</head>
    <p n="17">The First Canto of Childe Harold was begun at Janina , in Albania , October 31 , 1809 , and the Second Canto was finished at Smyrna , March 28 , 1810 . The dates were duly recorded on the MS .; but in none of the letters which Byron wrote to his mother and his friends from the East does he mention or allude to the composition or existence of such a work . In one letter , however , to his mother ( January 14 , 1811 , Letters , 1898 , i . 308 ) , he informs her that he has MSS . in his possession which may serve to prolong his memory , if his heirs and executors “ think proper to publish them ; ” but for himself , he has “ done with authorship . ” Three months later the achievement of Hints from Horace and The Curse of Minerva persuaded him to give “ authorship ” another trial ; and , in a letter written on board the Volage frigate ( June 28 , Letters , 1898 , i . 313 ) , he announces to his literary Mentor , R. C. Dallas , who had superintended the publication of English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers , that he has “ an imitation of the Ars Poetica of Horace ready for Cawthorne . ” Byron landed in England on July 2 , and on the 15th Dallas “ had the pleasure of shaking hands with him at Reddish 's Hotel , St. James 's Street ” ( Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron , 1824 , p. 103 ) . There was a crowd of visitors , says Dallas , and no time for conversation ; but the Imitation was placed in his hands . He took it home , read it , and was disappointed . Disparagement was out of the question ; but the next morning at breakfast Dallas ventured to express some surprise that he had written nothing else . An admission or confession followed that “ he had occasionally written short poems , besides a great many stanzas in Spenser 's measure , relative to the countries he had visited . ” “ They are not , ” he added , “ worth troubling you with , but you shall have them all with you if you like . ” “ So , ” says Dallas , “ came I by Childe Harold . He took it from a small trunk , with a number of verses . ”</p>
    <p n="18">Dallas was “ delighted , ” and on the evening of the same day ( July 16 ) — before , let us hope , and not after , he had consulted his “ Ionian friend , ” Walter Rodwell Wright ( see Recollections , p. 151 , and Diary of H. C. Robinson , 1872 , i . 17 ) — he despatched a letter of enthusiastic approval , which gratified Byron , but did not convince him of the extraordinary merit of his work , or of its certainty of success . It was , however , agreed that the MS. should be left with Dallas , that he should arrange for its publication and hold the copyright . Dallas would have entrusted the poem to Cawthorne , who had published English Bards , and Scotch Reviewers , and with whom , as Byron 's intermediary , he was in communication ; but Byron objected on the ground that the firm did not “ stand high enough in the trade , ” and Longmans , who had been offered but had declined the English Bards , were in no case to be approached . An application to Miller , of Albemarle Street , came to nothing , because Miller was Lord Elgin 's bookseller and publisher ( he had just brought out the Memorandum on Lord Elgin 's Pursuits in Greece ) , and Childe Harold denounced and reviled Lord Elgin . But Murray , of Fleet Street , who had already expressed a wish to publish for Lord Byron , was willing to take the matter into consideration . On the first of August Byron lost his mother , on the third his friend Matthews was drowned in the Cam , and for some weeks he could devote neither time nor thought to the fortunes of his poem ; but Dallas had bestirred himself , and on the eighteenth was able to report that he had “ seen Murray again , ” and that Murray was anxious that Byron 's name should appear on the title-page .</p>
    <p n="19">To this request Byron somewhat reluctantly acceded ( August 21 ) ; and a few days later ( August 25 ) he informs Dallas that he has sent him “ exordiums , annotations , etc ., for the forthcoming quarto , ” and has written to Murray , urging him on no account to show the MS. to Juvenal , that is , Gifford . But Gifford , as a matter of course , had been already consulted , had read the First Canto , and had advised Murray to publish the poem . Byron was , or pretended to be , furious ; but the solid fact that Gifford had commended his work acted like a charm , and his fury subsided . On the fifth of September ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 24 , note ) he received from Murray the first proof , and by December 14 “ the Pilgrimage was concluded , ” and all but the preface had been printed and seen through the press .</p>
    <p n="20">The original draft of the poem , which Byron took out of “ the little trunk ” and gave to Dallas , had undergone considerable alterations and modifications before this date . Both Dallas and Murray took exception to certain stanzas which , on personal , or patriotic , or religious considerations , were provocative and objectionable . They were apprehensive , not only for the sale of the book , but for the reputation of its author . Byron fought his ground inch by inch , but finally assented to a compromise . He was willing to cut out three stanzas on the Convention of Cintra , which had ceased to be a burning question , and four more stanzas at the end of the First Canto , which reflected on the Duke of Wellington , Lord Holland , and other persons of less note . A stanza on Beckford in the First Canto , and two stanzas in the second on Lord Elgin , Thomas Hope , and the “ Dilettanti crew , ” were also omitted . Stanza ix . of the Second Canto , on the immortality of the soul , was recast , and “ sure and certain ” hopelessness exchanged for a pious , if hypothetical , aspiration . But with regard to the general tenor of his politics and metaphysics , Byron stood firm , and awaited the issue .</p>
    <p n="21">There were additions as well as omissions . The first stanza of the First Canto , stanzas xliii . and xc ., which celebrate the battles of Albuera and Talavera ; the stanzas to the memory of Charles Skinner Matthews , nos . xci ., xcii . ; and stanzas ix ., xcv ., xcvi . of the Second Canto , which record Byron 's grief for the death of an unknown lover or friend , apparently ( letter to Dallas , October 31 , 1811 ) the mysterious Thyrza , and others ( vide post , note on the MSS . of the First and Second Cantos of Childe Harold ) , were composed at Newstead , in the autumn of 1811 . Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage , quarto , was published on Tuesday , March 10 , 1812 — Moore ( Life , p. 157 ) implies that the date of issue was Saturday , February 29 ; and Dallas ( Recollections , p. 220 ) says that he obtained a copy on Tuesday , March 3 ( but see advertisements in the Times and Morning Chronicle of Thursday , March 5 , announcing future publication , and in the Courier and Morning Chronicle of Tuesday , March 10 , announcing first appearance ) — and in three days an edition of five hundred copies was sold . A second edition , octavo , with six additional poems ( fourteen poems were included in the First Edition ) , was issued on April 17 ; a third on June 27 ; a fourth , with the “ Addition to the Preface , ” on September 14 ; and a fifth on December 5 , 1812 ,— the day on which Murray “ acquainted his friends ” ( see advertisement in the Morning Chronicle ) that he had removed from Fleet Street to No . 50 , Albemarle Street . A sixth edition , identical with the fifth and fourth editions , was issued August 11 , 1813 ; and , on February 1 , 1814 ( see letter to Murray , February 4 , 1814 ) , Childe Harold made a “ seventh appearance . ” The seventh edition was a new departure altogether . Not only were nine poems added to the twenty already published , but a dedication to Lady Charlotte Harley ( “ Ianthe ” ) , written in the autumn of 1812 , was prefixed to the First Canto , and ten additional stanzas were inserted towards the end of the Second Canto . Childe Harold , as we have it , differs to that extent from the Childe Harold which , in a day and a night , made Byron “ famous . ” The dedication to Ianthe was the outcome of a visit to Eywood , and his devotion to Ianthe 's mother , Lady Oxford ; but the new stanzas were probably written in 1810 . In a letter to Dallas , September 7 , 1811 ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 28 ) , he writes , “ I had projected an additional canto when I was in the Troad and Constantinople , and if I saw them again , it would go on . ” This seems to imply that a beginning had been made . In a poem , a hitherto unpublished fragment entitled Il Diavolo Inamorato ( vide post , vol . iii . ) , which is dated August 31 , 1812 , five stanzas and a half , viz . stanzas lxxiii . lines 5-9 , lxxix ., lxxx ., lxxxi ., lxxxii ., xxvii . of the Second Canto of Childe Harold are imbedded ; and these form part of the ten additional stanzas which were first published in the seventh edition . There is , too , the fragment entitled The Monk of Athos , which was first published ( Life of Lord Byron , by the Hon . Roden Noel ) in 1890 , which may have formed part of this projected Third Canto .</p>

   <titlePage>
    <docDate>No further alterations were made in the text of the poem ; but an eleventh edition of Childe Harold , Cantos I ., II ., was published in<date>1819</date>. The demerits of Childe Harold lie on the surface ; but it is difficult for the modern reader , familiar with the sight , if not the texture , of “ the purple patches , ” and unattracted , perhaps demagnetized , by a personality once fascinating and always “ puissant , ” to appreciate the actual worth and magnitude of the poem . We are “ o'er informed ; ” and as with Nature , so with Art , the eye must be couched , and the film of association removed , before we can see clearly . But there is one characteristic feature of Childe Harold which association and familiarity have been powerless to veil or confuse — originality of design . “ By what accident , ” asks the Quarterly Reviewer ( George Agar Ellis ) , “ has it happened that no other English poet before Lord Byron has thought fit to employ his talents on a subject so well suited to their display ? ” The question can only be answered by the assertion that it was the accident of genius which inspired the poet with a “ new song . ” Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage had no progenitors , and , with the exception of some feeble and forgotten imitations , it has had no descendants . The materials of the poem ; the Spenserian stanza , suggested , perhaps , by Campbell 's Gertrude of Wyoming , as well as by older models ; the language , the metaphors , often appropriated and sometimes stolen from the Bible , from Shakespeare , from the classics ; the sentiments and reflections coeval with reflection and sentiment , wear a familiar hue ; but the poem itself , a pilgrimage to scenes and cities of renown , a song of travel , a rhythmical diorama , was Byron 's own handiwork — not an inheritance , but a creation .</docDate>
    <docImprint>But what of the eponymous hero , the sated and melancholy “ Childe , ” with his attendant page and yeoman , his backward glances on “ heartless parasites , ” on “ laughing dames , ” on goblets and other properties of “ the monastic dome ” ? Is Childe Harold Byron masquerading in disguise , or is he intended to be a fictitious personage , who , half unconsciously , reveals the author 's personality ? Byron deals with the question in a letter to Dallas ( October 31 ): “ I by no means intend to identify myself with Harold , but to deny all connection with him . If in parts I may be thought to have drawn from myself , believe me it is but in parts , and I shall not own even to that . ” He adds , with evident sincerity , “ I would not be such a fellow as I have made my hero for all the world . ” Again , in the preface , “ Harold is the child of imagination . ” This pronouncement was not the whole truth ; but it is truer than it seems . He was well aware that Byron had sate for the portrait of Childe Harold . He had begun by calling his hero Childe Burun , and the few particulars which he gives of Childe Burun 's past were particulars , in the main exact particulars , of Byron 's own history . He had no motive for concealment , for , so little did he know himself , he imagined that he was not writing for publication , that he had done with authorship . Even when the mood had passed , it was the imitation of the Ars Poetica , not Childe Harold , which he was eager to publish ; and when Childe Harold had been offered to and accepted by a publisher , he desired and proposed that it should appear anonymously . He had not as yet come to the pass of displaying “ the pageant of his bleeding heart ” before the eyes of the multitude . But though he shrank from the obvious and inevitable conclusion that Childe Harold was Byron in disguise , and idly “ disclaimed ” all connection , it was true that he had intended to draw a fictitious character , a being whom he may have feared he might one day become , but whom he did not recognize as himself . He was not sated , he was not cheerless , he was not unamiable . He was all a-quiver with youth and enthusiasm and the joy of great living . He had left behind him friends whom he knew were not “ the flatterers of the festal hour ” — friends whom he returned to mourn and nobly celebrate . Byron was not Harold , but Harold was an ideal Byron , the creature and avenger of his pride , which haunted and pursued its presumptuous creator to the bitter end . Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage was reviewed , or rather advertised , by Dallas , in the Literary Panorama for March ,<date>1812</date>. To the reviewer 's dismay , the article , which appeared before the poem was out , was shown to Byron , who was paying a short visit to his old friends at Harrow . Dallas quaked , but “ as it proved no bad advertisement , ” he escaped censure . “ The blunder passed unobserved , eclipsed by the dazzling brilliancy of the object which had caused it ” ( Recollections , p. 221 ) . Of the greater reviews , the Quarterly ( No . xiii ., March ,<date>1812</date>) was published on May 12 , and the Edinburgh ( No . 38 , June ,<date>1812</date>) was published on August 5 ,<date>1812</date>.

      <head>PREFACE [ a ]</head>
      <p n="1">[ TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS . ]</p>
      <p n="2">The following poem was written , for the most part , amidst the scenes which it attempts [ b ] to describe . It was begun in Albania ; and the parts relative to Spain and Portugal were composed from the author 's observations in those countries . Thus much it may be necessary to state for the correctness of the descriptions . The scenes attempted to be sketched are in Spain , Portugal , Epirus , Acarnania and Greece . There , for the present , the poem stops : its reception will determine whether the author may venture to conduct his readers to the capital of the East , through Ionia and Phrygia : these two cantos are merely experimental .</p>
      <p n="3">A fictitious character is introduced for the sake of giving some connection to the piece ; which , however , makes no pretension to regularity . It has been suggested to me by friends , on whose opinions I set a high value , [ c ] — that in this fictitious character , “ Childe Harold , ” I may incur the suspicion of having intended some real personage : this I beg leave , once for all , to disclaim — Harold is the child of imagination , for the purpose I have stated .</p>
      <p n="4">In some very trivial particulars , and those merely local , there might be grounds for such a notion ; [ d ] but in the main points , I should hope , none whatever . [ e ]</p>
      <p n="5">It is almost superfluous to mention that the appellation “ Childe ,"[ 2 ] as “ Childe Waters , ” “ Childe Childers , ” etc ., is used as more consonant with the old structure of versification which I have adopted . The “ Good Night ” in the beginning of the first Canto , was suggested by Lord Maxwell 's “ Good Night "[ 3 ] in the Border Minstrelsy , edited by Mr. Scott .</p>
      <p n="6">With the different poems<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>which have been published on Spanish subjects , there may be found some slight coincidence [ f ] in the first part , which treats of the Peninsula , but it can only be casual ; as , with the exception of a few concluding stanzas , the whole of the poem was written in the Levant .</p>
      <p n="7">The stanza of Spenser , according to one of our most successful poets , admits of every variety . Dr. Beattie makes the following observation :—</p>
      <p n="8">“ Not long ago I began a poem in the style and stanza of Spenser , in which I propose to give full scope to my inclination , and be either droll or pathetic , descriptive or sentimental , tender or satirical , as the humour strikes me ; for , if I mistake not , the measure which I have adopted admits equally of all these kinds of composition . "[ 5 ] Strengthened in my opinion by such authority , and by the example of some in the highest order of Italian poets , I shall make no apology for attempts at similar variations in the following composition ; [ g ] satisfied that , if they are unsuccessful , their failure must be in the execution , rather than in the design sanctioned by the practice of Ariosto , Thomson , and Beattie .</p>
      <p n="9">London , February , 1812 .</p>

     <head>ADDITION TO THE PREFACE .</head>
     <p>I have now waited till almost all our periodical journals have distributed their usual portion of criticism . To the justice of the generality of their criticisms I have nothing to object ; it would ill become me to quarrel with their very slight degree of censure , when , perhaps , if they had been less kind they had been more candid . Returning , therefore , to all and each my best thanks for their liberality , on one point alone I shall venture an observation . Amongst the many objections justly urged to the very indifferent character of the “ vagrant Childe ” ( whom , notwithstanding many hints to the contrary , I still maintain to be a fictitious personage ) , it has been stated , that , besides the anachronism , he is very unknightly , as the times of the Knights were times of Love , Honour , and so forth .<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>Now it so happens that the good old times , when “ l'amour du bon vieux tems , l'amour antique , ” flourished , were the most profligate of all possible centuries . Those who have any doubts on this subject may consult Sainte-Palaye , passim , and more particularly vol . ii . p. 69 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 7 ]</span>The vows of chivalry were no better kept than any other vows whatsoever ; and the songs of the Troubadours were not more decent , and certainly were much less refined , than those of Ovid . The “ Cours d'Amour , parlemens d'amour , ou de courtoisie et de gentilesse ” had much more of love than of courtesy or gentleness . See Rolland<span type="note_anchor">[ 8 ]</span>on the same subject with Sainte-Palaye .</p>
     <p>Whatever other objection may be urged to that most unamiable personage Childe Harold , he was so far perfectly knightly in his attributes — “ No waiter , but a knight templar . "[ 9 ] By the by , I fear that Sir Tristrem and Sir Lancelot were no better than they should be , although very poetical personages and true knights , “ sans peur , ” though not “ sans réproche . ” If the story of the institution of the “ Garter ” be not a fable , the knights of that order have for several centuries borne the badge of a Countess of Salisbury , of indifferent memory . So much for chivalry . Burke need not have regretted that its days are over , though Marie-Antoinette was quite as chaste as most of those in whose honour lances were shivered , and knights unhorsed .<span type="note_anchor">[ 10 ]</span></p>
     <p>Before the days of Bayard , and down to those of Sir Joseph Banks<span type="note_anchor">[ 11 ]</span>( the most chaste and celebrated of ancient and modern times ) few exceptions will be found to this statement ; and I fear a little investigation will teach us not to regret these monstrous mummeries of the middle ages .</p>
     <p>I now leave “ Childe Harold ” to live his day such as he is ; it had been more agreeable , and certainly more easy , to have drawn an amiable character . It had been easy to varnish over his faults , to make him do more and express less , but he never was intended as an example , further than to show , that early perversion of mind and morals leads to satiety of past pleasures and disappointment in new ones , and that even the beauties of nature and the stimulus of travel ( except ambition , the most powerful of all excitements ) are lost on a soul so constituted , or rather misdirected . Had I proceeded with the Poem , this character would have deepened as he drew to the close ; for the outline which I once meant to fill up for him was , with some exceptions , the sketch of a modern Timon ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 12 ]</span>perhaps a poetical Zeluco .<span type="note_anchor">[ 13 ]</span></p>

Now , Childe Harold , if not absolutely craven and recreant , is at least a mortal enemy to all martial exertion , a scoffer at the fair sex , and , apparently , disposed to consider all religions as different modes of superstition . ” The tone of the review is severer than the Preface indicates . Nor does Byron attempt to reply to the main issue of the indictment , an unknightly aversion from war , but rides off on a minor point , the licentiousness of the Troubadours .</note>

Zeluco was an unmitigated scoundrel , who led an adventurous life ; but the prolix narrative of his villanies does not recall Childe Harold . There is , perhaps , some resemblance between Zeluco 's unbridled childhood and youth , due to the indulgence of a doting mother , and Byron 's early emancipation from discipline and control .</note>

     <note>14 ] [ The Lady Charlotte Mary Harley , second daughter of Edward , fifth Earl of Oxford and Mortimer , was born 1801 . She married , in 1823 , Captain Anthony Bacon ( died July 2 , 1864 ) , who had followed “ young , gallant Howard ” ( see Childe Harold , III . xxix . ) in his last fatal charge at Waterloo , and who , subsequently , during the progress of the civil war between Dom Miguel and Maria da Gloria of Portugal ( 1828-33 ) , held command as colonel of cavalry in the Queen 's forces , and finally as a general officer . Lady Charlotte Bacon died May 9 , 1880 . Byron 's acquaintance with her probably dated from his visit to Lord and Lady Oxford , at Eywood House , in Herefordshire , in October-November , 1812 . Her portrait , by Westall , which was painted at his request , is included among the illustrations in Finden 's Illustrations of the Life and Works of Lord Byron , ii . See Gent . Mag ., N. S ., vol . xvii . ( 1864 ) p. 261 ; and an obituary notice in the Times , May 10 , 1880 , See , too , letter to Murray , March 29 , 1813 ( Letters , 1898 , ii . 200 ) .</note>

     <note>28 ] [ The “ trivial particular ” which suggested to Byron the friendlessness and desolation of the Childe may be explained by the refusal of an old schoolfellow to spend the last day with him before he set out on his travels . The friend , possibly Lord Delawarr , excused himself on the plea that “ he was engaged with his mother and some ladies to go shopping . ” “ Friendship ! ” he exclaimed to Dallas . “ I do not believe I shall leave behind me , yourself and family excepted , and , perhaps , my mother , a single being who will care what becomes of me ” ( Dallas , Recollections , etc ., pp . 63 , 64 ) . Byron , to quote Charles Lamb 's apology for Coleridge , was “ full of fun , ” and must not be taken too seriously . Doubtless he was piqued at the moment , and afterwards , to heighten the tragedy of Childe Harold 's exile , expanded a single act of negligence into general abandonment and desertion at the hour of trial .</note>

     <note>31 ] [ In a suppressed stanza of “ Childe Harold 's Good Night ” ( see p. 27 , var . ii . ) , the Childe complains that he has not seen his sister for “ three long years and moe . ” Before her marriage , in 1807 , Augusta Byron divided her time between her mother 's children , Lady Chichester and the Duke of Leeds ; her cousin , Lord Carlisle ; and General and Mrs. Harcourt . After her marriage to Colonel Leigh , she lived at Newmarket . From the end of 1805 Byron corresponded with her more or less regularly , but no meeting took place . In a letter to his sister , dated November 30 , 1808 ( Letters , 1898 , i . 203 ) , he writes , “ I saw Col. Leigh at Brighton in July , where I should have been glad to have seen you ; I only know your husband by sight . ” Colonel Leigh was his first cousin , as well as his half-sister 's husband , and the incidental remark that “ he only knew him by sight ” affords striking proof that his relations and connections were at no pains to seek him out , but left him to fight his own way to social recognition and distinction .

Byron thought highly of Vathek . “ I do not know , ” he writes ( The Giaour , l. 1328 , note ) , “ from what source the author ... may have drawn his materials ... but for correctness of costume ... and power of imagination , it surpasses all European imitations ....

The question is not alluded to in the Weekly Political Register of September 17 , but on the 24th Cobbett opened fire with a long article ( pp . 481-502 ) headed , “ Conventions in Portugal , ” which was followed up by articles on the same subject in the four succeeding issues . Articles iii ., iv ., v ., vi ., of the “ Definitive Convention ” provided for the restoration of the French troops and their safe convoy to France , with their artillery , equipments , and cavalry . “ Did the men , ” asks Cobbett ( September 24 ) , “ who made this promise beat the Duke d'Abrantés [ Junot ] , or were they like curs , who , having felt the bite of the mastiff , lose all confidence in their number , and , though they bark victory , suffer him to retire in quiet , carrying off his bone to be disposed of at his leisure ? No , not so ; for they complaisantly carry the bone for him . ” The rest of the article is written in a similar strain .</note>

No sooner had he assumed his position as commander-in-chief , than he countermanded Wellesley 's order to give pursuit and make good the victory . The next day ( August 22 ) Sir Hew Dalrymple in turn superseded Burrard , and on the 23rd , General Kellerman approached the English with certain proposals from Junot , which a week later were formulated by the so-called Convention of Cintra , to which Kellerman and Wellesley affixed their names . When the news reached England that Napoleon 's forces had been repulsed with loss , and yet the French had been granted a safe exit from Portugal , the generals were assailed with loud and indiscriminate censure . Burrard 's interference with Wellesley 's plans was no doubt ill-judged and ill-timed ; but the opportunity of pursuit having been let slip , the acceptance of Junot 's terms was at once politic and inevitable . A court of inquiry , which was held in London in January , 1809 , upheld both the armistice of August 22 and the Convention ; but neither Dalrymple nor Burrard ever obtained a second command , and it was not until Talavera ( July 28 , 1809 ) had effaced the memories of Cintra that Wellesley was reinstated in popular favour .</note>

The death of her husband , of her favourite confessor , Ignatio de San Caetano , who had been raised by Pombal from the humblest rank to the position of archbishop in partibus , and of her son , turned her brain , and she became melancholy mad . She was only queen in name after 1791 , and in 1799 her son , Maria José Luis , was appointed regent . Beckford saw her in 1787 , and was impressed by her dignified bearing . “ Justice and clemency , ” he writes , “ the motto so glaringly misapplied on the banner of the abhorred Inquisition , might be transferred , with the strictest truth , to this good princess ” ( Italy , with Sketches of Spain and Portugal , 1834 , p. 256 ) . Ten years later , Southey , in his Letters from Spain , 1797 , p. 541 , ascribes the “ gloom ” of the court of Lisbon to “ the dreadful malady of the queen . ” When the Portuguese royal family were about to embark for Brazil in November , 1807 , the queen was once more seen in public after an interval of sixteen years . “ She had to wait some while upon the quay for the chair in which she was to be carried to the boat , and her countenance , in which the insensibility of madness was only disturbed by wonder , formed a striking contrast to the grief which appeared in every other face ” ( Southey 's History of the Peninsular War , i . 110 ) . ]</p>

From a passage in a letter to Dallas ( August 21 , 1811 ) , it appears that Byron had almost made up his mind to leave out “ the two stanzas of a buffooning cast on London 's Sunday ” ( Letters , 1898 , i . 335 ) .

The oath , or rather a small part of it , ran as follows : “ Take notice what I am saying unto you , for that is the first word of your oath — mind that ! You must acknowledge me [ the landlord ] to be your adopted father , etc .... You must not eat brown bread while you can get white , except you like the brown best . You must not drink small beer while you can get strong , except you like the small best . You must not kiss the maid while you can kiss the mistress , but sooner than lose a good chance you may kiss them both , ” etc .

Each bull-fight , which lasts about twenty minutes , is divided into three stages or acts . In the first act the picadores receive the charge of the bull , defending themselves , but not , as a rule , attacking the foe with their lances or garrochas . In the second act the chulos , who are not mounted , wave coloured cloaks or handkerchiefs in the bull 's face , and endeavour to divert his fury from the picadores , in case they have been thrown or worsted in the encounter . At the same time , the banderilleros are at pains to implant in either side of the bull 's neck a number of barbed darts ornamented with cut paper , and , sometimes , charged with detonating powder . It is de rigeur to plant the barbs exactly on either side . In the third and final act , the protagonist , the matador or espada , is the sole performer . His function is to entice the bull towards him by waving the muleta or red flag , and , standing in front of the animal , to inflict the death-wound by plunging his sword between the left shoulder and the blade . “ The teams of mules now enter , glittering with flags and tinkling with bells , whose gay decorations contrast with the stern cruelty and blood ; the dead bull is carried off at a rapid gallop , which always delights the populace . ” — Handbook for Spain , by Richard Ford , 1898 , i . 67-76 .</note>

Lady Byron regarded this creed of despair as the secret of her husband 's character , and the source of his aberrations . In a letter to H. C. Robinson , March 5 , 1855 , she writes , “ Not merely from casual expressions , but from the whole tenour of Lord Byron 's feelings , I could not but conclude he was a believer in the inspiration of the Bible , and had the gloomiest Calvinistic tenets . To that unhappy view of the relation of the creature to the Creator , I have always ascribed the misery of his life .... Instead of being made happier by any apparent good , he felt convinced that every blessing would be ‘ turned into a curse ’ to him . Who , possessed by such ideas , could lead a life of love and service to God or man ? They must in a measure realize themselves . ‘ The worst of it is , I do believe , ’ he said .

     <p>It is a well-known fact that in the year 1809 , the assassinations in the streets of Lisbon and its vicinity were not confined by the Portuguese to their countrymen ; but that Englishmen were daily butchered : and so far from redress being obtained , we were requested not to interfere if we perceived any compatriot defending himself against his allies . I was once stopped in the way to the theatre at eight o'clock in the evening , when the streets were not more empty than they generally are at that hour , opposite to an open shop , and in a carriage with a friend : had we not fortunately been armed , I have not the least doubt that we should have “ adorned a tale ” instead of telling one . The crime of assassination is not confined to Portugal ; in Sicily and Malta we are knocked on the head at a handsome average nightly , and not a Sicilian or Maltese is ever punished !</p>

     <note>The following “ Note on Spain and Portugal , ” part of the original draft of Note 3 ( p. 86 ) , was suppressed at the instance of Dallas : “ We have heard wonders of the Portuguese lately , and their gallantry . Pray Heaven it continue ; yet ‘ would it were bed-time , Hal , and all were well ! ’ They must fight a great many hours , by ‘ Shrewsbury clock , ’ before the number of their slain equals that of our countrymen butchered by these kind creatures , now metamorphosed into ‘ Caçadores , ’ and what not . I merely state a fact , not confined to Portugal ; for in Sicily and Malta we are knocked on the head at a handsome average nightly , and not a Sicilian or Maltese is ever punished ! The neglect of protection is disgraceful to our government and governors ; for the murders are as notorious as the moon that shines upon them , and the apathy that overlooks them . The Portuguese , it is to be hoped , are complimented with the ‘ Forlorn Hope , ’ — if the cowards are become brave ( like the rest of their kind , in a corner ) , pray let them display it . But there is a subscription for these θρασύδειλοι [ thrasy / deiloi ][ 110 ] ( they need not be ashamed of the epithet once applied to the Spartans ) ; and all the charitable patronymics , from ostentatious A. to diffident Z ., and £ 1 1s . 0d . from ‘ An Admirer of Valour , ’ are in requisition for the lists at Lloyd 's , and the honour of British benevolence . Well ! we have fought , and subscribed , and bestowed peerages , and buried the killed by our friends and foes ; and , lo ! all this is to be done over again ! Like Lien Chi ( in Goldsmith 's Citizen of the World ) , as we ‘ grow older , we grow never the better . ’ It would be pleasant to learn who will subscribe for us , in or about the year 1815 , and what nation will send fifty thousand men , first to be decimated in the capital , and then decimated again ( in the Irish fashion , nine out of ten ) , in the ‘ bed of honour ; ’ which , as Serjeant Kite says [ in Farquhar 's Recruiting Officer , act i. sc . 1 ] , is considerably larger and more commodious than ‘ the bed of Ware . ’ Then they must have a poet to write the ‘ Vision of Don Perceval ,'[ 111 ] and generously bestow the profits of the well and widely printed quarto , to rebuild the ‘ Backwynd ’ and the ‘ Canongate , ’ or furnish new kilts for the half-roasted Highlanders . Lord Wellington , however , has enacted marvels ; and so did his Oriental brother , whom I saw charioteering over the French flag , and heard clipping bad Spanish , after listening to the speech of a patriotic cobler of Cadiz , on the event of his own entry into that city , and the exit of some five thousand bold Britons out of this ‘ best of all possible worlds ’ [ Pangloss , in Candide ] . Sorely were we puzzled how to dispose of that same victory of Talavera ; and a victory it surely was somewhere , for everybody claimed it . The Spanish despatch and mob called it Cuesta 's , and made no great mention of the Viscount ; the French called it theirs<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>( to my great discomfiture ,— for a French consul stopped my mouth in Greece with a pestilent Paris Gazette , just as I had killed Sebastiani '[ 112 ] ‘ in buckram , ’ and King Joseph ‘ in Kendal green ’ ) ,— and we have not yet determined what to call it , or whose ; for , certes , it was none of our own . Howbeit , Massena 's retreat [ May , 1811 ] is a great comfort ; and as we have not been in the habit of pursuing for some years past , no wonder we are a little awkward at first . No doubt we shall improve ; or , if not , we have only to take to our old way of retrograding , and there we are at home . ” — Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron , 1824 , pp . 179-185 .</note>

       <l n="2">Stanza xlviii . line 5 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ Vivā el Rey Fernando ! ” Long live King Ferdinand ! is the chorus of most of the Spanish patriotic songs . They are chiefly in dispraise of the old King Charles , the Queen , and the Prince of Peace . I have heard many of them : some of the airs are beautiful . Godoy , the Principe de la Paz , of an ancient but decayed family , was born at Badajoz , on the frontiers of Portugal , and was originally in the ranks of the Spanish guards ; till his person attracted the queen 's eyes , and raised him to the dukedom of Alcudia , etc ., etc . It is to this man that the Spaniards universally impute the ruin of their country .</p>
     <note>Manuel de Godoy ( 1767-1851 ) received the title of Principe de la Paz , Prince of the Peace , in 1795 , after the Treaty of Basle , which ceded more than half St. Domingo to France . His tenure of power , as prime minister and director of the king 's policy , coincided with the downfall of Spanish power , and before the commencement of the Peninsular War he was associated in the minds of the people with national corruption and national degradation . He was , moreover , directly instrumental in the betrayal of Spain to France . By the Treaty of Fontainebleau , October 27 , 1807 , Portugal was to be divided between the King of Etruria and Godoy as Prince of the Algarves , Portuguese America was to fall to the King of Spain , and to bring this about Napoleon 's troops were to enter Spain and march directly to Lisbon . The sole outcome of the treaty was the occupation of Portugal and subsequent invasion of Spain . Before Byron had begun his pilgrimage , Godoy 's public career had come to an end . During the insurrection at Aranjuez , March 17-19 , 1808 , when Charles IV . abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand VII ., Godoy was only preserved from the fury of the populace by a timely imprisonment . In the following May , by which time Ferdinand himself was a prisoner in France , he was released at the instance of Murat , and ordered to accompany Charles to Bayonne , for the express purpose of cajoling his master into a second abdication in favour of Napoleon . The remainder of his long life was passed , first at Rome , and afterwards at Paris , in exile and dependence . The execration of Godoy , “ who was really a mild , good-natured man , ” must , in Napier 's judgment , be attributed to Spanish venom and Spanish prejudice . The betrayal of Spain was , he thinks , the outcome of Ferdinand 's intrigues no less than of Godoy 's unpatriotic ambition . Another and perhaps truer explanation of popular odium is to be found in his supposed atheism and well-known indifference to the rites of the Church , which many years before had attracted the attention of the Holy Office . The peasants cursed Godoy because the priests triumphed over his downfall ( Napier 's History of the War in the Peninsula , i . 8 ; Southey 's Peninsular War , i . 85 note , 93 , 215 , 280 ) .</note>

     <p>Such were the exploits of the Maid of Saragoza , who by her valour elevated herself to the highest rank of heroines . When the author was at Seville , she walked daily on the Prado , decorated with medals and orders , by command of the Junta .</p>
     <p>[ The story , as told by Southey ( who seems to have derived his information from The Narrative of the Siege of Zaragoza , by Charles Richard Vaughan , M. B ., 1809 ) , is that “ Augustina Zaragoza ( sic ) , a handsome woman of the lower class , about twenty-two years of age , ” a vivandiere , in the course of her rounds came with provisions to a battery near the Portello gate . The gunners had all been killed , and , as the citizens held back , “ Augustina sprang over the dead and dying , snatched a match from the hand of a dead artilleryman , and fired off a twenty-six pounder ; then , jumping upon the gun , made a solemn vow never to quit it alive during the siege . ”</p>
     <p>After the retreat of the French , “ a pension was settled upon Augustina , and the daily pay of an artilleryman . She was also to wear a small shield of honour , embroidered upon the sleeve of her gown , with ‘ Zaragoza ’ inscribed upon it ” ( Southey 's Peninsular War , ii . 14 , 34 ) .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <note>Towards the close of the first siege of Zaragoza , August 5 , 1808 , Marshal Lefebvre ( 1755-1820 ) , under the impression that the city had fallen into his hands , “ required Palafox to surrender in these words : ‘ Quartel-general , Santa Engracia . La Capitulation ! ’ [ ‘ Head-quarters , St. Engracia . Capitulation ’ ] . The reply was , ‘ Quartel-general , Zaragoza . Guerra al cuchillo ’ [ ‘ Head-quarters , Zaragoza . War at the knife 's point ’ ] . ” Subsequently , December , 1808 , when Moncey ( 1754-1842 ) again called upon him to surrender , he appealed to the people of Madrid . “ The dogs , ” he said , “ by whom he was beset scarcely left him time to clean his sword from their blood ; but they still found their grave at Zaragoza . ” Southey notes that “ all Palafox 's proclamations had the high tone and something of the inflection of Spanish romance , suiting the character of those to whom it was directed ” ( Peninsular War , ii . 25 ; iii . 152 ; Narrative of the Siege , by C. R. Vaughan , 1809 , pp . 22 , 23 ) . Napier , whose account of the first siege of Zaragoza is based on Caballero 's Victoires et Conquètes des Français , and on the Journal of Lefebvre 's Operations ( MSS . ) , does not record these romantic incidents . He attributes the raising of the siege to the “ bad discipline of the French , and the system of terror established by the Spanish leaders . ” The inspirers and proclaimers of “ war even to the knife ” were , he maintains , Tio or Goodman Jorge ( Jorge Ibort ) and Tio Murin , and not Palafox , who was ignorant of war , and who , on more than one occasion , was careful to provide for his own safety ( History of the War in the Peninsula , i . 41-46 ) .</note>

     <p>I should have ventured a verse to the memory of the late Charles Skinner Matthews , Fellow of Downing College , Cambridge , were he not too much above all praise of mine . His powers of mind , shown in the attainment of greater honours , against the ablest candidates , than those of any graduate on record at Cambridge , have sufficiently established his fame on the spot where it was acquired ; while his softer qualities live in the recollection of friends who loved him too well to envy his superiority . [ To an objection made by Dallas to this note , Byron replied , “ I was so sincere in my note on the late Charles Matthews , and do feel myself so totally unable to do justice to his talents , that the passage must stand for the very reason you bring against it . To him all the men I ever knew were pigmies . He was an intellectual giant . It is true I loved Wingfield better ; he was the earliest and the dearest , and one of the few one could never repent of having loved : but in ability — ah ! you did not know Matthews ,! ” — Letters , 1898 , ii . 8 .

     <p>[ Note .— The MS. closes with stanza xcii . Stanzas xciii. - xcviii . were added after Childe Harold was in the press . Byron sent them to Dallas , October 11 , 1811 , and , apparently , on the same day composed the Epistle to a Friend ( F. Hodgson ) in answer to some lines exhorting the Author to be cheerful , and to “ Banish Care , ” and the first poem To Thyrza ( “ Without a stone to mark the Spot ” ) . “ I have sent , ” he writes , “ two or three additional stanzas for both ‘ Fyttes . ’ I have been again shocked with a death , and have lost one very dear to me in happier times ; but ‘ I have almost forgot the taste of grief , ’ and ‘ supped full of horrors ’ till I have become callous , nor have I a tear left for an event which , five years ago , would have bowed down my head to the earth . It seems as though I were to experience in my youth the greatest misery of age . My friends fall around me , and I shall be left a lonely tree before I am withered . ” In one respect he would no longer disclaim identity with Childe Harold . “ Death had deprived him of his nearest connections . ” He had seen his friends “ around him fall like leaves in wintry weather . ” He felt “ like one deserted ; ” and in the “ dusky shadow ” of that early desolation he was destined to walk till his life 's end . It is not without cause when “ a man of great spirit grows melancholy . ”</p>
     <p>In connection with this subject , it may be noted that lines 6 and 7 of stanza xcv . do not bear out Byron 's contention to Dallas ( Letters , October 14 and 31 , 1811 ) , that in these three in memoriam stanzas ( ix ., xcv ., xcvi . ) he is bewailing an event which took place after he returned to Newstead . The “ more than friend ” had “ ceased to be ” before the “ wanderer ” returned . It is evident that Byron did not take Dallas into his confidence . ]</p>
     <lg type="poem">
      <head>FOOTNOTES :</head>
      <note>113 ] { 99 } [ Stanzas i. - xv . form a kind of dramatic prologue to the Second Canto of the Pilgrimage . The general meaning is clear enough , but the unities are disregarded . The scene shifts more than once , and there is a moral within a moral . The poet begins by invoking Athena ( Byron wrote Athenæ ) to look down on the ruins of “ her holy and beautiful house , ” and bewails her unreturning heroes of the sword and pen . He then summons an Oriental , a “ Son of the Morning , ” Moslem or “ light Greek , ” possibly a Canis venaticus , the discoverer or vendor of a sepulchral urn , and , with an adjuration to spare the sacred relic , points to the Acropolis , the cemetery of dead divinities , and then once more to the urn at his feet . “ ‘ Vanity of vanities — all is vanity ! ’ Gods and men may come and go , but Death ‘ goes on for ever . ’ ” The scene changes , and he feigns to be present at the rifling of a barrow , the “ tomb of the Athenian heroes ” on the plain of Marathon , or one of the lonely tumuli on Sigeum and Rhoeteum , “ the great and goodly tombs ” of Achilles and Patroclus ( “ they twain in one golden urn ” ) ; of Antilochus , and of Telamonian Ajax . Marathon he had already visited , and marked “ the perpendicular cut ” which at Fauvel 's instigation had been recently driven into the large barrow ; and he had , perhaps , read of the real or pretended excavation by Signor Ghormezano ( 1787 ) of a tumulus at the Sigean promontory . The “ mind 's eye , ” which had conjured up “ the shattered heaps , ” images a skull of one who “ kept the world in awe , ” and , after moralizing in Hamlet 's vein on the humorous catastrophe of decay , the poet concludes with the Preacher “ that there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom in the grave . ” After this profession of unfaith , before he returns to Harold and his pilgrimage , he takes up his parable and curses Elgin and all his works . The passage as a whole suggests the essential difference between painting and poetry . As a composition , it recalls the frontispiece of a seventeenth-century classic . The pictured scene , with its superfluity of accessories , is grotesque enough ; but the poetic scenery , inconsequent and yet vivid as a dream , awakens , and fulfills the imagination . ( Travels in Albania , by Lord Broughton , 1858 , i . 380 ; ii . 128 , 129 , 138 ; The Odyssey , xxiv . 74 , sq . See , too , Byron 's letters to his mother , April 17 , and to H.

     <note>120 ] { 104 } [ Byron forwarded this stanza in a letter to Dallas , dated October 14 , 1811 , and was careful to add , “ I think it proper to state to you , that this stanza alludes to an event which has taken place since my arrival here , and not to the death of any male friend ” ( Letters . 1898 , ii . 57 ) . The reference is not to Edleston , as Dallas might have guessed , and as Wright ( see Poetical Works , 1891 , p. 17 ) believed . Again , in a letter to Dallas , dated October 31 , 1811 ( ibid ., ii . 65 ) , he sends “ a few stanzas , ” presumably the lines “ To Thyrza , ” which are dated October 31 , 1811 , and says that “ they refer to the death of one to whose name you are a stranger , and , consequently , cannot be interested ( sic ) ... They relate to the same person whom I have mentioned in Canto 2nd , and at the conclusion of the poem . ” It follows from this second statement that we have Byron 's authority for connecting stanza ix . with stanzas xcv ., xcvi ., and , inferentially , his authority for connecting stanzas ix ., xcv ., xcvi . with the group of “ Thyrza ” poems . And there our knowledge ends . We must leave the mystery where Byron willed that it should be left . “ All that we know is , nothing can be known . ”</note>

     <p>In felicity of expression , the copy , if it be a copy , surpasses the original ; but in the scope and originality of the image , it is vastly inferior . Nor are these lines , with the possible exception of line 3 — “ Where things that own not Man 's dominion dwell , ” at all Wordsworthian . They fail in that imaginative precision which the Lake poets regarded as essential , and they lack the glamour and passion without which their canons of art would have profited nothing . Six years later , when Byron came within sound of Wordsworth 's voice , he struck a new chord — a response , not an echo . Here the motive is rhetorical , not immediately poetical . ]</p>

     <p>The actual mount , “ the giant height [ 6350 feet ] , rears itself in solitary magnificence , an insulated cone of white limestone . ” “ When it is seen from a distance , the peninsula [ of which the southern portion rises to a height of 2000 feet ] is below the horizon , and the peak rises quite solitary from the sea . ” Of this effect Byron may have had actual experience ; but Hobhouse , in describing the prospect from Cape Janissary , is careful to record that “ Athos itself is said to be sometimes visible in the utmost distance ( circ . 90 miles ) , but it was not discernible during our stay on the spot . ” ( Murray 's Handbook for Greece , p. 843 ; Childe Harold , edited by H.

The lines were written in October , 1809 , within a month of his departure from “ Calypso 's isles , ” and the Childe Harold stanzas belong to the early spring of 1810 . “ Ou sont les neiges d'antan ? ” Moreover , he speaks by the card .

Languishing in soft and thrilling sentiments , I demanded from a woman a sympathy and inclination of like nature with my own . If she fell ...

     <note>140 ] [ Byron and Hobhouse sailed for Malta in the brig-of-war Spider on Tuesday , September 19 , 1809 ( Byron , in a letter to his mother , November 12 , says September 21 ) , and anchored off Patras on the night of Sunday , the 24th . On Tuesday , the 26th , they were under way at 12 noon , and on the evening of that day they saw the sun set over Mesalonghi . The next morning , September 27 , they were in the channel between Ithaca and the mainland , with Ithaca , then in the hands of the French , to the left . “ We were close to it , ” says Hobhouse , “ and saw a few shrubs on a brown heathy land , two little towns in the hills scattered among trees . ” The travellers made “ but little progress this day , ” and , apparently , having redoubled Cape St. Andreas , the southern extremity of Ithaca , they sailed ( September 28 ) through the channel between Ithaca and Cephalonia , passed the hill of Ætos , on which stood the so-called “ Castle of Ulysses , ” whence Penelope may have “ overlooked the wave , ” and caught sight of “ the Lover 's refuge ” in the distance . Towards the close of the same day they doubled Cape Ducato ( “ Leucadia 's cape , ” the scene of Sappho 's leap ) , and , sailing under “ the ancient mount , ” the site of the Temple of Apollo , anchored off Prevesa at seven in the evening . Poetry and prose are not always in accord . If , as Byron says , it was “ an autumn 's eve ” when they hailed “ Leucadia 's cape afar , ” if the evening star shone over the rock when they approached it , they must have sailed fast to reach Prevesa , some thirty miles to the north , by seven o'clock . But de minimis , the Muse is as disregardful as the Law . And , perhaps , after all , it was Hobhouse who misread his log-book .

But what security is there for the eternity of verse and Fame ? “ Quis custodiet custodes ? ”</note>

Before long , “ the thunder roared as it seemed without any intermission ; for the echoes of one peal had not ceased to roll in the mountains before another crash burst over our heads . ” Byron , dragoman , and baggage were not three miles from Zitza when the storm began , and they lost their way .

Constantin Carapanos , a native of Arta . In his monograph , Dodone et ses Ruines ( Paris , 1878 , 4to ) , M. Carapanos gives a detailed description of the theatre , the twofold Temenos ( I. L'Enceinte du Temple , II . Téménos , pp . 13-28 ) , including the Temple of Zeus and a sanctuary of Aphrodite , and of the numerous ex voto offerings and inscriptions on lead which were brought to light during the excavations , and helped to identify the ruins . An accompanying folio volume of plates contains ( Planches , i ., ii . ) a map of the valley of Tcharacovista , and a lithograph of Mount Tomaros , “ d'un aspect majestueux et pittoresque ... un roc nu sillonné par le lit de nombreux torrents ” ( p. 8 ) . Behind Dodona , on the summit of the many-named chain of hills which confronts Mount Tomaros , are “ bouquets de chêne , ” sprung it may be from the offspring of the προσήγοροι δρύες [ prosê / goroi dry / es ] ( Æsch ., Prom ., 833 ) , the “ talking oaks , ” which declared the will of Zeus . For the “ prophetic fount ” ( line 2 ) , Servius , commenting on Virgil , Æneid , iii . 41-66 , seems to be the authority : “ Circa hoc templum quercus immanis fuisse dicitur ex cujus radicibus fons manebat , qui suo murmure instinctu Deorum diversis oracula reddebat ” ( Virgilii Opera , Leovardiæ , 1717 , i . 548 ) .</p>

     <note>In 1684 , when the Venetian Armada threatened Athens , the Turks removed the Temple of Victory , and made use of the materials for the construction of a bastion . In the autumn of 1687 , when the city was besieged by the Venetians under Francesco Morosini ( 1618-1694 ; Doge of Venice , 1688 ) , “ mortars were planted ... near the north-east corner of the rock , which threw their shells at a high angle , with a low charge , into the Acropolis .... On the 25th of September , a Venetian bomb blew up a small powder-magazine in the Propylæa , and on the following evening another fell in the Parthenon , where the Turks had deposited ... a considerable quantity of powder .... A terrific explosion took place ; the central columns of the peristyle , the walls of the cella , and the immense architraves and cornices they supported , were scattered around the remains of the temple . The Propylæa had been partly destroyed in 1656 by the explosion of a magazine which was struck by lightning . ” — Finlay 's History of Greece , 1887 , i . 185 .</note>

     <p>We can all feel , or imagine , the regret with which the ruins of cities , once the capitals of empires , are beheld : the reflections suggested by such objects are too trite to require recapitulation . But never did the littleness of man , and the vanity of his very best virtues , of patriotism to exalt , and of valour to defend his country appear more conspicuous than in the record of what Athens was , and the certainty of what she now is . This theatre of contention between mighty factions , of the struggles of orators , the exaltation and deposition of tyrants , the triumph and punishment of generals , is now become a scene of petty intrigue and perpetual disturbance , between the bickering agents of certain British nobility and gentry . “ The wild foxes , the owls and serpents in the ruins of Babylon ,"[ 202 ] were surely less degrading than such inhabitants . The Turks have the plea of conquest for their tyranny , and the Greeks have only suffered the fortune of war , incidental to the bravest ; but how are the mighty fallen , when two painters<span type="note_anchor">[ 203 ]</span>contest the privilege of plundering the Parthenon , and triumph in turn , according to the tenor of each succeeding firman ! Sylla could but punish , Philip subdue , and Xerxes burn Athens ; but it remained for the paltry antiquarian , and his despicable agents , to render her contemptible as himself and his pursuits . The Parthenon , before its destruction , in part , by fire during the Venetian siege , had been a temple , a church , and a mosque .<span type="note_anchor">[ 204 ]</span>In each point of view it is an object of regard : it changed its worshippers ; but still it was a place of worship thrice sacred to devotion : its violation is a triple sacrifice .

     <p>It was not always the custom of the Greeks to burn their dead ; the greater Ajax , in particular , was interred entire . Almost all the chiefs became gods after their decease ; and he was indeed neglected , who had not annual games near his tomb , or festivals in honour of his memory by his countrymen , as Achilles , Brasidas , etc ., and at last even Antinous , whose death was as heroic as his life was infamous .</p>

     <p>The Temple of Jupiter Olympius , of which sixteen columns , entirely of marble , yet survive ; originally there were one hundred and fifty . These columns , however , are by many supposed to have belonged to the Pantheon .</p>
     <note>The Olympieion , or Temple of Zeus Olympius , on the south-east of the Acropolis , some five hundred yards from the foot of the rock , was begun by Pisistratos , and completed seven hundred years later by Hadrian . It was one of the three or four largest temples of antiquity . The cella had been originally enclosed by a double row of twenty columns at the sides , and a triple row of eight columns at each front , making a hundred and four columns in all ; but in 1810 only sixteen “ lofty Corinthian columns ” were standing . Mr. Tozer points out that “ ‘ base ’ is accurate , because Corinthian columns have bases , which Doric columns have not , ” and notes that the word “ ‘ unshaken ’ implies that the column itself had fallen , but the base remains . ” — Childe Harold , 1888 , p. 228 .</note>

     <p>At this moment ( January 3 , 1810 ) , besides what has been already deposited in London , an Hydriot vessel is in the Pyræus to receive every portable relic . Thus , as I heard a young Greek observe , in common with many of his countrymen — for , lost as they are , they yet feel on this occasion — thus may Lord Elgin boast of having ruined Athens . An Italian painter of the first eminence , named Lusieri<span type="note_anchor">[ 205 ]</span>, is the agent of devastation ; and like the Greek finder<span type="note_anchor">[ 206 ]</span>of Verres in Sicily , who followed the same profession , he has proved the able instrument of plunder . Between this artist and the French Consul Fauvel<span type="note_anchor">[ 207 ]</span>, who wishes to rescue the remains for his own government , there is now a violent dispute concerning a car employed in their conveyance , the wheel of which — I wish they were both broken upon it !— has been locked up by the Consul , and Lusieri has laid his complaint before the Waywode . Lord Elgin has been extremely happy in his choice of Signer Lusieri . During a residence of ten years in Athens , he never had the curiosity to proceed as far as Sunium ( now Cape Colonna ) ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 208 ]</span>till he accompanied us in our second excursion . However , his works , as far as they go , are most beautiful : but they are almost all unfinished . While he and his patrons confine themselves to tasting medals , appreciating cameos , sketching columns , and cheapening gems , their little absurdities are as harmless as insect or fox-hunting , maiden-speechifying , barouche-driving , or any such pastime ; but when they carry away three or four shiploads of the most valuable and massy relics that time and barbarism have left to the most injured and most celebrated of cities : when they destroy , in a vain attempt to tear down , those works which have been the admiration of ages , I know no motive which can excuse , no name which can designate , the perpetrators of this dastardly devastation . It was not the least of the crimes laid to the charge of Verres , that he had plundered Sicily , in the manner since imitated at Athens . The most unblushing impudence could hardly go farther than to affix the name of its plunderer to the walls of the Acropolis ; while the wanton and useless defacement of the whole range of the basso-relievos , in one compartment of the temple , will never permit that name to be pronounced by an observer without execration .</p>
     <p>On this occasion I speak impartially : I am not a collector or admirer of collections , consequently no rival ; but I have some early prepossession in favour of Greece , and do not think the honour of England advanced by plunder , whether of India or Attica .</p>
     <p>Another noble Lord [ Aberdeen ] has done better , because he has done less : but some others , more or less noble , yet “ all honourable men , ” have done best , because , after a deal of excavation and execration , bribery to the Waywode , mining and countermining , they have done nothing at all . We had such ink-shed , and wine-shed , which almost ended in bloodshed !<span type="note_anchor">[ 209 ]</span>Lord E .' s “ prig ” — see Jonathan Wild for the definition of “ priggism "[ 210 ] — quarrelled with another , Gropius<span type="note_anchor">[ 211 ]</span>by name ( a very good name too for his business ) , and muttered something about satisfaction , in a verbal answer to a note of the poor Prussian : this was stated at table to Gropius , who laughed , but could eat no dinner afterwards . The rivals were not reconciled when I left Greece . I have reason to remember their squabble , for they wanted to make me their arbitrator .</p>

       <l n="3">Stanza xxxviii . lines 5 and 6 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Albania comprises part of Macedonia , Illyria , Chaonia , and Epirus . Iskander is the Turkish word for Alexander ; and the celebrated Scanderbeg<span type="note_anchor">[ 212 ]</span>( Lord Alexander ) is alluded to in the third and fourth lines of the thirty-eighth stanza . I do not know whether I am correct in making Scanderbeg the countryman of Alexander , who was born at Pella in Macedon , but Mr. Gibbon terms him so , and adds Pyrrhus to the list , in speaking of his exploits .</p>
     <p>Of Albania Gibbon remarks that a country “ within sight of Italy is less known than the interior of America . ” Circumstances , of little consequence to mention , led Mr. Hobhouse and myself into that country before we visited any other part of the Ottoman dominions ; and with the exception of Major Leake ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 213 ]</span>then officially resident at Joannina , no other Englishmen have ever advanced beyond the capital into the interior , as that gentleman very lately assured me . Ali Pacha was at that time ( October , 1809 ) carrying on war against Ibrahim Pacha , whom he had driven to Berat , a strong fortress , which he was then besieging : on our arrival at Joannina we were invited to Tepaleni , his highness 's birthplace , and favourite Serai , only one day 's distance from Berat ; at this juncture the Vizier had made it his headquarters . After some stay in the capital , we accordingly followed ; but though furnished with every accommodation , and escorted by one of the Vizier 's secretaries , we were nine days ( on account of the rains ) in accomplishing a journey which , on our return , barely occupied four . On our route we passed two cities , Argyrocastro and Libochabo , apparently little inferior to Yanina in size ; and no pencil or pen can ever do justice to the scenery in the vicinity of Zitza and Delvinachi , the frontier village of Epirus and Albania Proper .</p>
     <p>On Albania and its inhabitants I am unwilling to descant , because this will be done so much better by my fellow-traveller , in a work which may probably precede this in publication , that I as little wish to follow as I would to anticipate him .<span type="note_anchor">[ 214 ]</span>But some few observations are necessary to the text . The Arnaouts , or Albanese , struck me forcibly by their resemblance to the Highlanders of Scotland , in dress , figure , and manner of living . Their very mountains seemed Caledonian , with a kinder climate . The kilt , though white ; the spare , active form ; their dialect , Celtic in its sound ; and their hardy habits , all carried me back to Morven . No nation are so detested and dreaded by their neighbours as the Albanese ; the Greeks hardly regard them as Christians , or the Turks as Moslems ; and in fact they are a mixture of both , and sometimes neither . Their habits are predatory — all are armed ; and the red-shawled Arnaouts , the Montenegrins , Chimariots , and Gegdes , are treacherous ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 215 ]</span>the others differ somewhat in garb , and essentially in character . As far as my own experience goes , I can speak favourably . I was attended by two , an Infidel and a Mussulman , to Constantinople and every other part of Turkey which came within my observation ; and more faithful in peril , or indefatigable in service , are rarely to be found . The Infidel was named Basilius ; the Moslem , Dervish Tahiri ; the former a man of middle age , and the latter about my own . Basili was strictly charged by Ali Pacha in person to attend us ; and Dervish was one of fifty who accompanied us through the forests of Acarnania to the banks of Achelous , and onward to Messalonghi in Ætolia . There I took him into my own service , and never had occasion to repent it till the moment of my departure .</p>
     <p>When , in 1810 , after the departure of my friend Mr. Hobhouse for England , I was seized with a severe fever in the Morea , these men saved my life by frightening away my physician , whose throat they threatened to cut if I was not cured within a given time . To this consolatory assurance of posthumous retribution , and a resolute refusal of Dr. Romanelli 's prescriptions , I attributed my recovery . [ gg ] I had left my last remaining English servant at Athens ; my dragoman was as ill as myself , and my poor Arnaouts nursed me with an attention which would have done honour to civilization . They had a variety of adventures ; for the Moslem , Dervish , being a remarkably handsome man , was always squabbling with the husbands of Athens ; insomuch that four of the principal Turks paid me a visit of remonstrance at the Convent on the subject of his having taken a woman from the bath — whom he had lawfully bought , however — a thing quite contrary to etiquette . Basili also was extremely gallant amongst his own persuasion , and had the greatest veneration for the church , mixed with the highest contempt of churchmen , whom he cuffed upon occasion in a most heterodox manner . Yet he never passed a church without crossing himself ; and I remember the risk he ran in entering St. Sophia , in Stambol , because it had once been a place of his worship . On remonstrating with him on his inconsistent proceedings , he invariably answered , “ Our church is holy , our priests are thieves : ” and then he crossed himself as usual , and boxed the ears of the first “ papas ” who refused to assist in any required operation , as was always found to be necessary where a priest had any influence with the Cogia Bashi<span type="note_anchor">[ 216 ]</span>of his village . Indeed , a more abandoned race of miscreants cannot exist than the lower orders of the Greek clergy .</p>
     <p>When preparations were made for my return , my Albanians were summoned to receive their pay . Basili took his with an awkward show of regret at my intended departure , and marched away to his quarters with his bag of piastres . I sent for Dervish , but for some time he was not to be found ; at last he entered , just as Signor Logotheti ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 217 ]</span>father to the ci-devant Anglo-consul of Athens , and some other of my Greek acquaintances , paid me a visit . Dervish took the money in his hand , but on a sudden dashed it to the ground ; and clasping his hands , which he raised to his forehead , rushed out of the room weeping bitterly . From that moment to the hour of my embarkation , he continued his lamentations , and all our efforts to console him only produced this answer , “ Μ'αφεινει [ M'apheinei ] ” , “ He leaves me . ” Signer Logotheti , who never wept before for anything less than the loss of a para ( about the fourth of a farthing ) , melted ; the padre of the convent , my attendants , my visitors — and I verily believe that even Sterne 's “ foolish fat scullion ” would have left her “ fish-kettle ” to sympathize with the unaffected and unexpected sorrow of this barbarian .<span type="note_anchor">[ 218 ]</span></p>
     <p>For my own part , when I remembered that , a short time before my departure from England , a noble and most intimate associate had excused himself from taking leave of me because he had to attend a female relation “ to a milliner 's ,"[ 219 ] I felt no less surprised than humiliated by the present occurrence and the past recollection . That Dervish would leave me with some regret was to be expected ; when master and man have been scrambling over the mountains of a dozen provinces together , they are unwilling to separate ; but his present feelings , contrasted with his native ferocity , improved my opinion of the human heart . I believe this almost feudal fidelity is frequent amongst them . One day , on our journey over Parnassus , an Englishman in my service gave him a push in some dispute about the baggage , which he unluckily mistook for a blow ; he spoke not , but sat down leaning his head upon his hands . Foreseeing the consequences , we endeavoured to explain away the affront , which produced the following answer :— “ I have been a robber ; I am a soldier ; no captain ever struck me ; you are my master , I have eaten your bread , but by that bread ! ( a usual oath ) had it been otherwise , I would have stabbed the dog , your servant , and gone to the mountains . ” So the affair ended , but from that day forward he never thoroughly forgave the thoughtless fellow who insulted him . Dervish excelled in the dance of his country , conjectured to be a remnant of the ancient Pyrrhic : be that as it may , it is manly , and requires wonderful agility . It is very distinct from the stupid Romaika ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 220 ]</span>the dull round-about of the Greeks , of which our Athenian party had so many specimens .</p>
     <p>The Albanians in general ( I do not mean the cultivators of the earth in the provinces , who have also that appellation , but the mountaineers ) have a fine cast of countenance ; and the most beautiful women I ever beheld , in stature and in features , we saw levelling the road broken down by the torrents between Delvinachi and Libochabo . Their manner of walking is truly theatrical ; but this strut is probably the effect of the capote , or cloak , depending from one shoulder . Their long hair reminds you of the Spartans , and their courage in desultory warfare is unquestionable . Though they have some cavalry amongst the Gegdes , I never saw a good Arnaout horseman ; my own preferred the English saddles , which , however , they could never keep . But on foot they are not to be subdued by fatigue .</p>

     <p>Actium and Trafalgar need no further mention . The battle of Lepanto [ October 7 , 1571 ] , equally bloody and considerable , but less known , was fought in the Gulf of Patras . Here the author of Don Quixote lost his left hand .</p>
     <note>“ His [ Cervantes ’ ] galley the Marquesa , was in the thick of the fight , and before it was over he had received three gun-shot wounds , two in the breast and one on the left hand or arm . ” In consequence of his wound “ he was seven months in hospital before he was discharged . He came out with his left hand permanently disabled ; he had lost the use of it , as Mercury told him in the ‘ Viaje del Parnase , ’ for the greater glory of the right . ” — Don Quixote , A Translation by John Ormsby , 1885 , Introduction , i . 13 .</note>

     </lg>
     <note>Strabo ( lib . x. cap . 2 , ed . Paris , 1853 , p. 388 ) gives Menander as an authority for the legend that Sappho was the first to take the “ Lover 's Leap ” from the promontory of Leucate . Writers , he adds , better versed in antiquities ἀρχαιολογικώτεροι [ a ) rchaiologikô / teroi ] , prefer the claims of one Cephalus . Another legend , which he gives as a fact , perhaps gave birth to the later and more poetical fiction . The Leucadians , he says , once a year , on Apollo 's day , were wont to hurl a criminal from the rock into the sea by way of expiation and propitiation . Birds of all kinds were attached to the victim to break his fall , and , if he reached the sea uninjured , there was a fleet of little boats ready to carry him to other shores . It is possible that dim memories of human sacrifice lingered in the islands , that in course of time victims were transformed into “ lovers , ” and it is certain that poets and commentators , “ prone to lie , ” are responsible for names and incidents .</note>

     <p>The convent and village of Zitza are four hours ’ journey from Joannina , or Yanina , the capital of the Pachalick . In the valley the river Kalamas ( once the Acheron ) flows , and , not far from Zitza , forms a fine cataract . The situation is perhaps the finest in Greece , though the approach to Delvinachi and parts of Acarnania and Ætolia may contest the palm . Delphi , Parnassus , and , in Attica , even Cape Colonna and Port Raphti , are very inferior ; as also every scene in Ionia , or the Troad : I am almost inclined to add the approach to Constantinople ; but , from the different features of the last , a comparison can hardly be made .</p>

     <p>The last stanza would puzzle a commentator : the men have certainly buskins of the most beautiful texture , but the ladies ( to whom the above is supposed to be addressed ) have nothing under their little yellow boots and slippers but a well-turned and sometimes very white ankle . The Arnaout girls are much handsomer than the Greeks , and their dress is far more picturesque . They preserve their shape much longer also , from being always in the open air . It is to be observed , that the Arnaout is not a written language : the words of this song , therefore , as well as the one which follows , are spelt according to their pronunciation . They are copied by one who speaks and understands the dialect perfectly , and who is a native of Athens .</p>

     <p>I believe the two last stanzas , as they are in a different measure , ought to belong to another ballad . An idea something similar to the thought in the last lines was expressed by Socrates , whose arm having come in contact with one of his “ ὑpokolpioi [ hupokolpioi ] , ” Critobulus or Cleobulus , the philosopher complained of a shooting pain as far as his shoulder for some days after , and therefore very properly resolved to teach his disciples in future without touching them .</p>

     <p>“ Siste Viator — heroa calcas ! ” was the epitaph on the famous Count Merci ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 221 ]</span>— what then must be our feelings when standing on the tumulus of the two hundred ( Greeks ) who fell on Marathon ? The principal barrow has recently been opened by Fauvel : few or no relics , as vases , etc . were found by the excavator . The plain of Marathon<span type="note_anchor">[ 222 ]</span>was offered to me for sale at the sum of sixteen thousand piastres , about nine hundred pounds ! Alas !— “ Expende<span type="note_anchor">[ 223 ]</span>— quot libras in duce summo — invenies ! ” — was the dust of Miltiades worth no more ? It could scarcely have fetched less if sold by weight .</p>

     <p>Before I say anything about a city of which every body , traveller or not , has thought it necessary to say something , I will request Miss Owenson ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 225 ]</span>when she next borrows an Athenian heroine for her four volumes , to have the goodness to marry her to somebody more of a gentleman than a “ Disdar Aga ” ( who by the by is not an Aga ) , the most impolite of petty officers , the greatest patron of larceny<span type="note_anchor">[ 226 ]</span>Athens ever saw ( except Lord E .) , and the unworthy occupant of the Acropolis , on a handsome annual stipend of 150 piastres ( eight pounds sterling ) , out of which he has only to pay his garrison , the most ill-regulated corps in the ill-regulated Ottoman Empire . I speak it tenderly , seeing I was once the cause of the husband of “ Ida of Athens ” nearly suffering the bastinado ; and because the said “ Disdar ” is a turbulent husband , and beats his wife ; so that I exhort and beseech Miss Owenson to sue for a separate maintenance in behalf of “ Ida . ” Having premised thus much , on a matter of such import to the readers of romances , I may now leave Ida to mention her birthplace .</p>
     <p>Setting aside the magic of the name , and all those associations which it would be pedantic and superfluous to recapitulate , the very situation of Athens would render it the favourite of all who have eyes for art or nature . The climate , to me at least , appeared a perpetual spring ; during eight months I never passed a day without being as many hours on horseback : rain is extremely rare , snow never lies in the plains , and a cloudy day is an agreeable rarity . In Spain , Portugal , and every part of the East which I visited , except Ionia and Attica , I perceived no such superiority of climate to our own ; and at Constantinople , where I passed May , June , and part of July ( 1810 ) , you might “ damn the climate , and complain of spleen , ” five days out of seven .<span type="note_anchor">[ 227 ]</span></p>
     <p>The air of the Morea is heavy and unwholesome , but the moment you pass the isthmus in the direction of Megara the change is strikingly perceptible . But I fear Hesiod will still be found correct in his description of a Boeotian winter .<span type="note_anchor">[ 228 ]</span></p>
     <p>We found at Livadia an “ esprit fort ” in a Greek bishop , of all free-thinkers ! This worthy hypocrite rallied his own religion with great intrepidity ( but not before his flock ) , and talked of a mass as a “ coglioneria . "[ 229 ] It was impossible to think better of him for this ; but , for a Boeotian , he was brisk with all his absurdity . This phenomenon ( with the exception indeed of Thebes , the remains of Chæronea , the plain of Platea , Orchomenus , Livadia , and its nominal cave of Trophonius ) was the only remarkable thing we saw before we passed Mount Cithæron .</p>
     <p>The fountain of Dirce turns a mill : at least my companion ( who , resolving to be at once cleanly and classical , bathed in it ) pronounced it to be the fountain of Dirce ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 230 ]</span>and any body who thinks it worth while may contradict him . At Castri we drank of half a dozen streamlets , some not of the purest , before we decided to our satisfaction which was the true Castalian , and even that had a villanous twang , probably from the snow , though it did not throw us into an epic fever , like poor Dr. Chandler .<span type="note_anchor">[ 231 ]</span></p>

     <p>I heard much of the beauty of Arcadia , but excepting the view from the Monastery of Megaspelion ( which is inferior to Zitza in a command of country ) , and the descent from the mountains on the way from Tripolitza to Argos , Arcadia has little to recommend it beyond the name .</p>
     <p>“ Sternitur , et dulces moriens reminiscitur Argos . ” Æneid , x . 782 .</p>
     <p>Virgil could have put this into the mouth of none but an Argive , and ( with reverence be it spoken ) it does not deserve the epithet . And if the Polynices of Statius , “ In mediis audit duo litora campis ” ( Thebaidos , i . 335 ) , did actually hear both shores in crossing the isthmus of Corinth , he had better ears than have ever been worn in such a journey since .</p>
     <p>“ Athens , ” says a celebrated topographer , “ is still the most polished city of Greece . "[ 232 ] Perhaps it may of Greece , but not of the Greeks ; for Joannina in Epirus is universally allowed , amongst themselves , to be superior in the wealth , refinement , learning , and dialect of its inhabitants . The Athenians are remarkable for their cunning ; and the lower orders are not improperly characterised in that proverb , which classes them with the “ Jews of Salonica , and the Turks of the Negropont . ”</p>
     <p>Among the various foreigners resident in Athens , French , Italians , Germans , Ragusans , etc ., there was never a difference of opinion in their estimate of the Greek character , though on all other topics they disputed with great acrimony .</p>
     <p>M. Fauvel , the French Consul , who has passed thirty years principally at Athens , and to whose talents as an artist , and manners as a gentleman , none who have known him can refuse their testimony , has frequently declared in my hearing , that the Greeks do not deserve to be emancipated ; reasoning on the grounds of their “ national and individual depravity ! ” while he forgot that such depravity is to be attributed to causes which can only be removed by the measure he reprobates .</p>
     <p>M. Roque ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 233 ]</span>a French merchant of respectability long settled in Athens , asserted with the most amusing gravity , “ Sir , they are the same canaille that existed in the days of Themistocles ! ” an alarming remark to the “ Laudator temporis acti . ” The ancients banished Themistocles ; the moderns cheat Monsieur Roque ; thus great men have ever been treated !</p>
     <p>In short , all the Franks who are fixtures , and most of the Englishmen , Germans , Danes , etc ., of passage , came over by degrees to their opinion , on much the same grounds that a Turk in England would condemn the nation by wholesale , because he was wronged by his lacquey , and overcharged by his washerwoman .</p>
     <p>Certainly it was not a little staggering when the Sieurs Fauvel and Lusieri , the two greatest demagogues of the day , who divide between them the power of Pericles and the popularity of Cleon , and puzzle the poor Waywode with perpetual differences , agreed in the utter condemnation , “ nulla virtute redemptum ” ( Juvenal , lib . i . Sat . iv . line 2 ) , of the Greeks in general , and of the Athenians in particular . For my own humble opinion , I am loth to hazard it , knowing as I do , that there be now in MS. no less than five tours of the first magnitude , and of the most threatening aspect , all in typographical array , by persons of wit and honour , and regular common-place books : but , if I may say this , without offence , it seems to me rather hard to declare so positively and pertinaciously , as almost everybody has declared , that the Greeks , because they are very bad , will never be better .</p>
     <p>Eton and Sonnini<span type="note_anchor">[ 234 ]</span>have led us astray by their panegyrics and projects ; but , on the other hand , De Pauw and Thornton<span type="note_anchor">[ 235 ]</span>have debased the Greeks beyond their demerits .</p>
     <p>The Greeks will never be independent ; they will never be sovereigns as heretofore , and God forbid they ever should ! but they may be subjects without being slaves . Our colonies are not independent , but they are free and industrious , and such may Greece be hereafter .</p>
     <p>At present , like the Catholics of Ireland and the Jews throughout the world , and such other cudgelled and heterodox people , they suffer all the moral and physical ills that can afflict humanity . Their life is a struggle against truth ; they are vicious in their own defence . They are so unused to kindness , that when they occasionally meet with it they look upon it with suspicion , as a dog often beaten snaps at your fingers if you attempt to caress him . “ They are ungrateful , notoriously , abominably ungrateful ! ” — this is the general cry . Now , in the name of Nemesis ! for what are they to be grateful ? Where is the human being that ever conferred a benefit on Greek or Greeks ? They are to be grateful to the Turks for their fetters , and to the Franks for their broken promises and lying counsels . They are to be grateful to the artist who engraves their ruins , and to the antiquary who carries them away ; to the traveller whose janissary flogs them , and to the scribbler whose journal abuses them . This is the amount of their obligations to foreigners .</p>

     <p>Amongst the remnants of the barbarous policy of the earlier ages , are the traces of bondage which yet exist in different countries ; whose inhabitants , however divided in religion and manners , almost all agree in oppression .</p>
     <p>The English have at last compassionated their negroes , and under a less bigoted government , may probably one day release their Catholic brethren ; but the interposition of foreigners alone can emancipate the Greeks , who , otherwise , appear to have as small a chance of redemption from the Turks , as the Jews have from mankind in general .</p>
     <p>Of the ancient Greeks we know more than enough ; at least the younger men of Europe devote much of their time to the study of the Greek writers and history , which would be more usefully spent in mastering their own . Of the moderns , we are perhaps more neglectful than they deserve ; and while every man of any pretensions to learning is tiring out his youth , and often his age , in the study of the language and of the harangues of the Athenian demagogues in favour of freedom , the real or supposed descendants of these sturdy republicans are left to the actual tyranny of their masters , although a very slight effort is required to strike off their chains .</p>
     <p>To talk , as the Greeks themselves do , of their rising again to their pristine superiority , would be ridiculous : as the rest of the world must resume its barbarism , after reasserting the sovereignty of Greece : but there seems to be no very great obstacle , except in the apathy of the Franks , to their becoming an useful dependency , or even a free state , with a proper guarantee ;— under correction , however , be it spoken , for many and well-informed men doubt the practicability even of this .</p>
     <p>The Greeks have never lost their hope , though they are now more divided in opinion on the subject of their probable deliverers . Religion recommends the Russians ; but they have twice been deceived and abandoned by that power , and the dreadful lesson they received after the Muscovite desertion in the Morea has never been forgotten . The French they dislike ; although the subjugation of the rest of Europe will , probably , be attended by the deliverance of continental Greece . The islanders look to the English for succour , as they have very lately possessed themselves of the Ionian republic , Corfu excepted .<span type="note_anchor">[ 237 ]</span>But whoever appear with arms in their hands will be welcome ; and when that day arrives , Heaven have mercy on the Ottomans ; they cannot expect it from the Giaours .</p>
     <p>But instead of considering what they have been , and speculating on what they may be , let us look at them as they are .</p>
     <p>And here it is impossible to reconcile the contrariety of opinions : some , particularly the merchants , decrying the Greeks in the strongest language ; others , generally travellers , turning periods in their eulogy , and publishing very curious speculations grafted on their former state , which can have no more effect on their present lot , than the existence of the Incas on the future fortunes of Peru .</p>
     <p>One very ingenious person terms them the “ natural allies of Englishmen ; ” another no less ingenious , will not allow them to be the allies of anybody , and denies their very descent from the ancients ; a third , more ingenious than either , builds a Greek empire on a Russian foundation , and realises ( on paper ) all the chimeras of Catharine II . As to the question of their descent , what can it import whether the Mainotes<span type="note_anchor">[ 238 ]</span>are the lineal Laconians or not ? or the present Athenians as indigenous as the bees of Hymettus , or as the grasshoppers , to which they once likened themselves ? What Englishman cares if he be of a Danish , Saxon , Norman , or Trojan blood ? or who , except a Welshman , is afflicted with a desire of being descended from Caractacus ?</p>
     <p>The poor Greeks do not so much abound in the good things of this world , as to render even their claims to antiquity an object of envy ; it is very cruel , then , in Mr. Thornton to disturb them in the possession of all that time has left them ; viz . their pedigree , of which they are the more tenacious , as it is all they can call their own . It would be worth while to publish together , and compare , the works of Messrs. Thornton and De Pauw , Eton and Sonnini ; paradox on one side , and prejudice on the other . Mr. Thornton conceives himself to have claims to public confidence from a fourteen years ’ residence at Pera ; perhaps he may on the subject of the Turks , but this can give him no more insight into the real state of Greece and her inhabitants , than as many years spent in Wapping into that of the Western Highlands .</p>
     <p>The Greeks of Constantinople live in Fanal ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 239 ]</span>and if Mr. Thornton did not oftener cross the Golden Horn than his brother merchants are accustomed to do , I should place no great reliance on his information . I actually heard one of these gentlemen boast of their little general intercourse with the city , and assert of himself , with an air of triumph , that he had been but four times at Constantinople in as many years .</p>
     <p>As to Mr. Thornton 's voyages in the Black Sea with Greek vessels , they gave him the same idea of Greece as a cruise to Berwick in a Scotch smack would of Johnny Groat 's house . Upon what grounds then does he arrogate the right of condemning by wholesale a body of men of whom he can know little ? It is rather a curious circumstance that Mr. Thornton , who so lavishly dispraises Pouqueville on every occasion of mentioning the Turks , has yet recourse to him as authority on the Greeks , and terms him an impartial observer . Now , Dr. Pouqueville is as little entitled to that appellation as Mr. Thornton to confer it on him .</p>
     <p>The fact is , we are deplorably in want of information on the subject of the Greeks , and in particular their literature ; nor is there any probability of our being better acquainted , till our intercourse becomes more intimate , or their independence confirmed . The relations of passing travellers are as little to be depended on as the invectives of angry factors ; but till something more can be attained , we must be content with the little to be acquired from similar sources .<span type="note_anchor">[ 240 ]</span></p>
     <p>However defective these may be , they are preferable to the parodoxes of men who have read superficially of the ancients , and seen nothing of the moderns , such as De Pauw ; who , when he asserts that the British breed of horses is ruined by Newmarket , and that the Spartans<span type="note_anchor">[ 241 ]</span>were cowards in the field ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 242 ]</span>betrays an equal knowledge of English horses and Spartan men . His “ philosophical observations ” have a much better claim to the title of “ poetical . ” It could not be expected that he who so liberally condemns some of the most celebrated institutions of the ancient , should have mercy on the modern Greeks ; and it fortunately happens , that the absurdity of his hypothesis on their forefathers refutes his sentence on themselves .</p>
     <p>Let us trust , then , that , in spite of the prophecies of De Pauw , and the doubts of Mr. Thornton , there is a reasonable hope of the redemption of a race of men , who , whatever may be the errors of their religion and policy , have been amply punished by three centuries and a half of captivity .</p>

     <p>Some time after my return from Constantinople to this city I received the thirty-first number of the Edinburgh Review<span type="note_anchor">[ 245 ]</span>as a great favour , and certainly at this distance an acceptable one , from the captain of an English frigate off Salamis . In that number , Art . 3 , containing the review of a French translation of Strabo ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 246 ]</span>there are introduced some remarks on the modern Greeks and their literature , with a short account of Coray , a co-translator in the French version . On those remarks I mean to ground a few observations ; and the spot where I now write will , I hope , be sufficient excuse for introducing them in a work in some degree connected with the subject . Coray , the most celebrated of living Greeks , at least among the Franks , was born at Scio ( in the Review , Smyrna is stated , I have reason to think , incorrectly ) , and besides the translation of Beccaria and other works mentioned by the Reviewer , has published a lexicon in Romaic and French , if I may trust the assurance of some Danish travellers lately arrived from Paris ; but the latest we have seen here in French and Greek is that of Gregory Zolikogloou .<span type="note_anchor">[ 247 ]</span>Coray has recently been involved in an unpleasant controversy with M. Gail ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 248 ]</span>a Parisian commentator and editor of some translations from the Greek poets , in consequence of the Institute having awarded him the prize for his version of Hippocrates ’ “ Περὶ ὑδάτων [ Peri \ y ( da / tôn ] , ” etc ., to the disparagement , and consequently displeasure , of the said Gail . To his exertions , literary and patriotic , great praise is undoubtedly due ; but a part of that praise ought not to be withheld from the two brothers Zosimado ( merchants settled in Leghorn ) , who sent him to Paris and maintained him , for the express purpose of elucidating the ancient , and adding to the modern , researches of his countrymen . Coray , however , is not considered by his countrymen equal to some who lived in the two last centuries ; more particularly Dorotheus of Mitylene ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 249 ]</span>whose Hellenic writings are so much esteemed by the Greeks , that Meletius<span type="note_anchor">[ 250 ]</span>terms him “ Μετὰ τὸν Θουκυδίδην καὶ Ξενοφώντα ἄριστος Ἑλλήνων [ Meta \ to Thoukydi / dên kai \ Xenophô / nta a )/ ristos E ( llê / nôn ] ” ( p. 224 , Ecclesiastical History , iv . ) .</p>
     <p>Panagiotes Kodrikas , the translator of Fontenelle , and Kamarases ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 251 ]</span>who translated Ocellus Lucanus on the Universe into French , Christodoulus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 252 ]</span>and more particularly Psalida ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 253 ]</span>whom I have conversed with in Joannina , are also in high repute among their literati . The last-mentioned has published in Romaic and Latin a work on True Happiness , dedicated to Catherine II . But Polyzois ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 254 ]</span>who is stated by the Reviewer to be the only modern except Coray who has distinguished himself by a knowledge of Hellenic , if he be the Polyzois Lampanitziotes of Yanina , who has published a number of editions in Romaic , was neither more nor less than an itinerant vender of books ; with the contents of which he had no concern beyond his name on the title page , placed there to secure his property in the publication ; and he was , moreover , a man utterly destitute of scholastic acquirements . As the name , however , is not uncommon , some other Polyzois may have edited the Epistles of Aristænetus .</p>
     <p>It is to be regretted that the system of continental blockade has closed the few channels through which the Greeks received their publications , particularly Venice and Trieste . Even the common grammars for children are become too dear for the lower orders . Amongst their original works the Geography of Meletius , Archbishop of Athens , and a multitude of theological quartos and poetical pamphlets , are to be met with ; their grammars and lexicons of two , three , and four languages are numerous and excellent . Their poetry is in rhyme . The most singular piece I have lately seen is a satire in dialogue between a Russian , English , and French traveller , and the Waywode of Wallachia ( or Blackbey , as they term him ) , an archbishop , a merchant ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 255 ]</span>and Cogia Bachi ( or primate ) , in succession ; to all of whom under the Turks the writer attributes their present degeneracy . Their songs are sometimes pretty and pathetic , but their tunes generally unpleasing to the ear of a Frank ; the best is the famous “ Δεύτε , παῖδες τῶν Ἑλλήνων [ Deu / te , pai ~ des tô ~ n E ( llê / nôn ] , ” by the unfortunate Riga .<span type="note_anchor">[ 256 ]</span>But from a catalogue of more than sixty authors , now before me , only fifteen can be found who have touched on any theme except theology .</p>
     <p>I am intrusted with a commission by a Greek of Athens named Marmarotouri to make arrangements , if possible , for printing in London a translation of Barthelemi 's Anacharsis in Romaic , as he has no other opportunity , unless he dispatches the MS. to Vienna by the Black Sea and Danube .</p>
     <p>The Reviewer mentions a school established at Hecatonesi ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 257 ]</span>and suppressed at the instigation of Sebastiani :[ 258 ] he means Cidonies , or , in Turkish , Haivali ; a town on the continent , where that institution for a hundred students and three professors still exists . It is true that this establishment was disturbed by the Porte , under the ridiculous pretext that the Greeks were constructing a fortress instead of a college ; but on investigation , and the payment of some purses to the Divan , it has been permitted to continue . The principal professor , named Ueniamin ( i. e . Benjamin ) , is stated to be a man of talent , but a freethinker . He was born in Lesbos , studied in Italy , and is master of Hellenic , Latin , and some Frank languages : besides a smattering of the sciences .</p>
     <p>Though it is not my intention to enter farther on this topic than may allude to the article in question , I cannot but observe that the Reviewer 's lamentation over the fall of the Greeks appears singular , when he closes it with these words : “ The change is to be attributed to their misfortunes rather than to any ‘ physical degradation . ’ ” It may be true that the Greeks are not physically degenerated , and that Constantinople contained on the day when it changed masters as many men of six feet and upwards as in the hour of prosperity ; but ancient history and modern politics instruct us that something more than physical perfection is necessary to preserve a state in vigour and independence ; and the Greeks , in particular , are a melancholy example of the near connexion between moral degradation and national decay .</p>
     <p>The Reviewer mentions a plan “ we believe ” by Potemkin<span type="note_anchor">[ 259 ]</span>for the purification of the Romaic ; and I have endeavoured in vain to procure any tidings or traces of its existence . There was an academy in St. Petersburg for the Greeks ; but it was suppressed by Paul , and has not been revived by his successor .</p>
     <p>There is a slip of the pen , and it can only be a slip of the pen , in p. 58 , No . 31 , of the Edinburgh Review , where these words occur : “ We are told that when the capital of the East yielded to Solyman ” — It may be presumed that this last word will , in a future edition , be altered to Mahomet II .<span type="note_anchor">[ 260 ]</span>The “ ladies of Constantinople , ” it seems , at that period spoke a dialect , “ which would not have disgraced the lips of an Athenian . ” I do not know how that might be , but am sorry to say that the ladies in general , and the Athenians in particular , are much altered ; being far from choice either in their dialect or expressions , as the whole Attic race are barbarous to a proverb :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Ὠ Ἀθῆναι , πρώτη χώρα [ Ô ) A ) thê ~ nai , prô / tê chô / ra ] ,</l>
       <l n="2">Τί γαιδάρους τρέφεις τώρα [ Ti / gaida / rous tre / pheis tô / ra ] ;"[ 261 ]</l>
     </lg>
     <p>In Gibbon , vol . x. p. 161 , is the following sentence :— “ The vulgar dialect of the city was gross and barbarous , though the compositions of the church and palace sometimes affected to copy the purity of the Attic models . ” Whatever may be asserted on the subject , it is difficult to conceive that the “ ladies of Constantinople , ” in the reign of the last Cæsar , spoke a purer dialect than Anna Comnena<span type="note_anchor">[ 262 ]</span>wrote , three centuries before : and those royal pages are not esteemed the best models of composition , although the princess γλῶτταν εἶχεν ἈΚΡΙΒΩΕ Ἀττικιϛούσαν [ glô ~ ttan ei ~) chen A ) KRIBÔE A ) ttikisou / san ] .<span type="note_anchor">[ 263 ]</span>In the Fanal , and in Yanina , the best Greek is spoken : in the latter there is a flourishing school under the direction of Psalida .</p>
     <p>There is now in Athens a pupil of Psalida 's , who is making a tour of observation through Greece : he is intelligent , and better educated than a fellow-commoner of most colleges . I mention this as a proof that the spirit of inquiry is not dormant among the Greeks .</p>
     <p>The Reviewer mentions Mr. Wright ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 264 ]</span>the author of the beautiful poem Horæ Ionicæ , as qualified to give details of these nominal Romans and degenerate Greeks ; and also of their language : but Mr. Wright , though a good poet and an able man , has made a mistake where he states the Albanian dialect of the Romaic to approximate nearest to the Hellenic ; for the Albanians speak a Romaic as notoriously corrupt as the Scotch of Aberdeenshire , or the Italian of Naples . Yanina , ( where , next to the Fanal , the Greek is purest ,) although the capital of Ali Pacha 's dominions , is not in Albania , but Epirus ; and beyond Delvinachi in Albania Proper up to Argyrocastro and Tepaleen ( beyond which I did not advance ) they speak worse Greek than even the Athenians . I was attended for a year and a half by two of these singular mountaineers , whose mother tongue is Illyric , and I never heard them or their countrymen ( whom I have seen , not only at home , but to the amount of twenty thousand in the army of Vely Pacha [ 265 ]) praised for their Greek , but often laughed at for their provincial barbarisms .</p>
     <p>I have in my possession about twenty-five letters , amongst which some from the Bey of Corinth , written to me by Notaras , the Cogia Bachi , and others by the dragoman of the Caimacam<span type="note_anchor">[ 266 ]</span>of the Morea ( which last governs in Vely Pacha 's absence ) , are said to be favourable specimens of their epistolary style . I also received some at Constantinople from private persons , written in a most hyperbolical style , but in the true antique character .</p>
     <p>The Reviewer proceeds , after some remarks on the tongue in its past and present state , to a paradox ( page 59 ) on the great mischief the knowledge of his own language has done to Coray , who , it seems , is less likely to understand the ancient Greek , because he is perfect master of the modern ! This observation follows a paragraph , recommending , in explicit terms , the study of the Romaic , as “ a powerful auxiliary , ” not only to the traveller and foreign merchant , but also to the classical scholar ; in short , to every body except the only person who can be thoroughly acquainted with its uses ; and by a parity of reasoning , our own language is conjectured to be probably more attainable by “ foreigners ” than by ourselves ! Now , I am inclined to think , that a Dutch Tyro in our tongue ( albeit himself of Saxon blood ) would be sadly perplexed with “ Sir Tristram ,"[ 267 ] or any other given “ Auchinleck MS . ” with or without a grammar or glossary ; and to most apprehensions it seems evident that none but a native can acquire a competent , far less complete , knowledge of our obsolete idioms . We may give the critic credit for his ingenuity , but no more believe him than we do Smollett 's Lismahago ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 268 ]</span>who maintains that the purest English is spoken in Edinburgh . That Coray may err is very possible ; but if he does , the fault is in the man rather than in his mother tongue , which is , as it ought to be , of the greatest aid to the native student .— Here the Reviewer proceeds to business on Strabo 's translators , and here I close my remarks .</p>
     <p>Sir W. Drummond , Mr. Hamilton , Lord Aberdeen , Dr. Clarke , Captain Leake , Mr. Gell , Mr. Walpole ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 269 ]</span>and many others now in England , have all the requisites to furnish details of this fallen people . The few observations I have offered I should have left where I made them , had not the article in question , and above all the spot where I read it , induced me to advert to those pages , which the advantage of my present situation enabled me to clear , or at least to make the attempt .</p>
     <p>I have endeavoured to waive the personal feelings which rise in despite of me in touching upon any part of the Edinburgh Review ; not from a wish to conciliate the favour of its writers , or to cancel the remembrance of a syllable I have formerly published , but simply from a sense of the impropriety of mixing up private resentments with a disquisition of the present kind , and more particularly at this distance of time and place .</p>
     <p>ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE TURKS .</p>
     <p>The difficulties of travelling in Turkey have been much exaggerated , or rather have considerably diminished , of late years . The Mussulmans have been beaten into a kind of sullen civility very comfortable to voyagers .</p>
     <p>It is hazardous to say much on the subject of Turks and Turkey ; since it is possible to live amongst them twenty years without acquiring information , at least from themselves . As far as my own slight experience carried me , I have no complaint to make ; but am indebted for many civilities ( I might almost say for friendship ) , and much hospitality , to Ali Pacha , his son Vely Pacha of the Morea , and several others of high rank in the provinces . Suleyman Aga , late Governor of Athens , and now of Thebes , was a bon vivant , and as social a being as ever sat cross-legged at a tray or a table . During the carnival , when our English party were masquerading , both himself and his successor were more happy to “ receive masks ” than any dowager in Grosvenor-square .<span type="note_anchor">[ 270 ]</span></p>
     <p>On one occasion of his supping at the convent , his friend and visitor , the Cadi<span type="note_anchor">[ 271 ]</span>of Thebes , was carried from table perfectly qualified for any club in Christendom ; while the worthy Waywode himself triumphed in his fall .</p>
     <p>In all money transactions with the Moslems , I ever found the strictest honour , the highest disinterestedness . In transacting business with them , there are none of those dirty peculations , under the name of interest , difference of exchange , commission , etc ., etc ., uniformly found in applying to a Greek consul to cash bills , even on the first houses in Pera .</p>
     <p>With regard to presents , an established custom in the East , you will rarely find yourself a loser ; as one worth acceptance is generally returned by another of similar value — a horse , or a shawl .</p>
     <p>In the capital and at court the citizens and courtiers are formed in the same school with those of Christianity ; but there does not exist a more honourable , friendly , and high-spirited character than the true Turkish provincial Aga , or Moslem country gentleman . It is not meant here to designate the governors of towns , but those Agas who , by a kind of feudal tenure , possess lands and houses , of more or less extent , in Greece and Asia Minor .</p>
     <p>The lower orders are in as tolerable discipline as the rabble in countries with greater pretensions to civilisation . A Moslem , in walking the streets of our country-towns , would be more incommoded in England than a Frank in a similar situation in Turkey . Regimentals are the best travelling dress .</p>
     <p>The best accounts of the religion and different sects of Islamism may be found in D'Ohsson ' s<span type="note_anchor">[ 272 ]</span>French ; of their manners , etc ., perhaps in Thornton 's English . The Ottomans , with all their defects , are not a people to be despised . Equal at least to the Spaniards , they are superior to the Portuguese . If it be difficult to pronounce what they are , we can at least say what they are not : they are not treacherous , they are not cowardly , they do not burn heretics , they are not assassins , nor has an enemy advanced to their capital . They are faithful to their sultan till he becomes unfit to govern , and devout to their God without an inquisition . Were they driven from St. Sophia to-morrow , and the French or Russians enthroned in their stead , it would become a question whether Europe would gain by the exchange . England would certainly be the loser .</p>
     <p>With regard to that ignorance of which they are so generally , and sometimes justly accused , it may be doubted , always excepting France and England , in what useful points of knowledge they are excelled by other nations . Is it in the common arts of life ? In their manufactures ? Is a Turkish sabre inferior to a Toledo ? or is a Turk worse clothed or lodged , or fed and taught , than a Spaniard ? Are their Pachas worse educated than a Grandee ? or an Effendi<span type="note_anchor">[ 273 ]</span>than a Knight of St. Jago ? I think not .</p>
     <p>I remember Mahmout , the grandson of Ali Pacha , asking whether my fellow-traveller and myself were in the upper or lower House of Parliament . Now , this question from a boy of ten years old proved that his education had not been neglected . It may be doubted if an English boy at that age knows the difference of the Divan from a College of Dervises ; but I am very sure a Spaniard does not . How little Mahmout , surrounded as he had been entirely by his Turkish tutors , had learned that there was such a thing as a Parliament , it were useless to conjecture , unless we suppose that his instructors did not confine his studies to the Koran .</p>
     <p>In all the mosques there are schools established , which are very regularly attended ; and the poor are taught without the church of Turkey being put into peril . I believe the system is not yet printed ( though there is such a thing as a Turkish press , and books printed on the late military institution of the Nizam Gedidd ) ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 274 ]</span>nor have I heard whether the Mufti and the Mollas have subscribed , or the Caimacan and the Tefterdar taken the alarm , for fear the ingenuous youth of the turban should be taught not to “ pray to God their way . ” The Greeks also — a kind of Eastern Irish papists — have a college of their own at Maynooth ,— no , at Haivali ; where the heterodox receive much the same kind of countenance from the Ottoman as the Catholic college from the English legislature . Who shall then affirm that the Turks are ignorant bigots , when they thus evince the exact proportion of Christian charity which is tolerated in the most prosperous and orthodox of all possible kingdoms ? But though they allow all this , they will not suffer the Greeks to participate in their privileges : no , let them fight their battles , and pay their haratch ( taxes ) , be drubbed in this world , and damned in the next . And shall we then emancipate our Irish Helots ? Mahomet forbid ! We should then be bad Mussulmans , and worse Christians : at present we unite the best of both — jesuitical faith , and something not much inferior to Turkish toleration .</p>

      <head>APPENDIX .</head>
      <p>Amongst an enslaved people , obliged to have recourse to foreign presses even for their books of religion , it is less to be wondered at that we find so few publications on general subjects than that we find any at all . The whole number of the Greeks , scattered up and down the Turkish empire and elsewhere , may amount , at most , to three millions ; and yet , for so scanty a number , it is impossible to discover any nation with so great a proportion of books and their authors as the Greeks of the present century . “ Aye , ” but say the generous advocates of oppression , who , while they assert the ignorance of the Greeks , wish to prevent them from dispelling it , “ ay , but these are mostly , if not all , ecclesiastical tracts , and consequently good for nothing . ” Well ! and pray what else can they write about ? It is pleasant enough to hear a Frank , particularly an Englishman , who may abuse the government of his own country ; or a Frenchman , who may abuse every government except his own , and who may range at will over every philosophical , religious , scientific , sceptical , or moral subject , sneering at the Greek legends . A Greek must not write on politics , and cannot touch on science for want of instruction ; if he doubts he is excommunicated and damned ; therefore his countrymen are not poisoned with modern philosophy ; and as to morals , thanks to the Turks ! there are no such things . What then is left him , if he has a turn for scribbling ? Religion and holy biography ; and it is natural enough that those who have so little in this life should look to the next . It is no great wonder then , that in a catalogue now before me of fifty-five Greek writers , many of whom were lately living , not above fifteen should have touched on anything but religion . The catalogue alluded to is contained in the twenty-sixth chapter of the fourth volume of Meletius ’ Ecclesiastical History .</p>

      <head>INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD CANTO .</head>
      <p>The Third Canto of Childe Harold was begun early in May , and finished at Ouchy , near Lausanne , on the 27th of June , 1816 . Byron made a fair copy of the first draft of his poem , which had been scrawled on loose sheets , and engaged the services of “ Claire ” ( Jane Clairmont ) to make a second transcription . Her task was completed on the 4th of July . The fair copy and Claire 's transcription remained in Byron 's keeping until the end of August or the beginning of September , when he consigned the transcription to “ his friend Mr. Shelley , ” and the fair copy to Scrope Davies , with instructions to deliver them to Murray ( see Letters to Murray , October 5 , 9 , 15 , 1816 ) . Shelley landed at Portsmouth , September 8 , and on the 11th of September he discharged his commission .</p>
      <p n="1">“ I was thrilled with delight yesterday , ” writes Murray ( September 12 ) , “ by the announcement of Mr. Shelley with the MS. of Childe Harold . I had no sooner got the quiet possession of it than , trembling with auspicious hope , ... I carried it ... to Mr. Gifford .... He says that what you have heretofore published is nothing to this effort .... Never , since my intimacy with Mr. Gifford , did I see him so heartily pleased , or give one fiftieth part of the praise , with one thousandth part of the warmth . ”</p>
      <p n="2">The correction of the press was undertaken by Gifford , not without some remonstrance on the part of Shelley , who maintained that “ the revision of the proofs , and the retention or alteration of certain particular passages had been entrusted to his discretion ” ( Letter to Murray , October 30 , 1816 ) .</p>
      <p n="3">When , if ever , Mr. Davies , of “ inaccurate memory ” ( Letter to Murray , December 4 , 1816 ) , discharged his trust is a matter of uncertainty . The “ original MS . ” ( Byron 's “ fair copy ” ) is not forthcoming , and it is improbable that Murray , who had stipulated ( September 20 ) “ for all the original MSS ., copies , and scraps , ” ever received it . The “ scraps ” were sent ( October 5 ) in the first instance to Geneva , and , after many wanderings , ultimately fell into the possession of Mrs. Leigh , from whom they were purchased by the late Mr. Murray .</p>
      <p n="4">The July number of the Quarterly Review ( No . XXX . ) was still in the press , and , possibly , for this reason it was not till October 29 that Murray inserted the following advertisement in the Morning Chronicle : “ Lord Byron 's New Poems . On the 23 ^ d of November will be published The Prisoners ( sic ) of Chillon , a Tale and other Poems . A Third Canto of Childe Harold .... ” But a rival was in the field . The next day ( October 30 ) , in the same print , another advertisement appeared : “ The R. H. Lord Byron 's Pilgrimage to the Holy Land .... Printed for J. Johnston , Cheapside .... Of whom may be had , by the same author , a new ed . ( the third ) of Farewell to England : with three other poems .... ” It was , no doubt , the success of his first venture which had stimulated the “ Cheapside impostor , ” as Byron called him , to forgery on a larger scale .</p>
      <p n="5">The controversy did not end there . A second advertisement ( Morning Chronicle , November 15 ) of “ Lord Byron 's Pilgrimage , ” etc ., stating that “ the copyright of the work was consigned ” to the Publisher “ exclusively by the Noble Author himself , and for which he gives 500 guineas , ” precedes Murray 's second announcement of The Prisoners of Chillon , and the Third Canto of Childe Harold , in which he informs “ the public that the poems lately advertised are not written by Lord Byron . The only bookseller at present authorised to print Lord Byron 's poems is Mr. Murray .... ” Further precautions were deemed necessary . An injunction in Chancery was applied for by Byron 's agents and representatives ( see , for a report of the case in the Morning Chronicle , November 28 , 1816 , Letters , vol . iv ., Letter to Murray , December 9 , 1816 , note ) , and granted by the Chancellor , Lord Eldon . Strangely enough , Sir Samuel Romilly , whom Byron did not love , was counsel for the plaintiff .</p>
      <p n="6">In spite of the injunction , a volume entitled “ Lord Byron 's Pilgrimage to the Holy Land , a Poem in Two Cantos . To which is attached a fragment , The Tempest , ” was issued in 1817 . It is a dull and , apparently , serious production , suggested by , but hardly an imitation of , Childe Harold . The notes are descriptive of the scenery , customs , and antiquities of Palestine . The Tempest , on the other hand , is a parody , and by no means a bad parody , of Byron at his worst ; e. g .—</p>
      <p n="7">“ There was a sternness in his eye , Which chilled the soul — one knew not why — But when returning vigour came , And kindled the dark glare to flame , So fierce it flashed , one well might swear , A thousand souls were centred there . ”</p>
      <p n="8">It is possible that this Pilgrimage was the genuine composition of some poetaster who failed to get his poems published under his own name , or it may have been the deliberate forgery of John Agg , or Hewson Clarke , or C. F. Lawler , the pseudo Peter Pindar — “ Druids ” who were in Johnston 's pay , and were prepared to compose pilgrimages to any land , holy or unholy , which would bring grist to their employer 's mill . ( See the Advertisements at the end of Lord Byron 's Pilgrimage , etc . )</p>
      <p n="9">The Third Canto was published , not as announced , on the 23rd , but on the 18th of November . Murray 's “ auspicious hope ” of success was amply fulfilled . He “ wrote to Lord Byron on the 13th of December , 1816 , informing him that at a dinner at the Albion Tavern , he had sold to the assembled booksellers 7000 of his Third Canto of Childe Harold .... ” The reviews were for the most part laudatory . Sir Walter Scott 's finely-tempered eulogium ( Quart . Rev ., No . xxxi ., October , 1816 [ published February 11 , 1817 ]) , and Jeffrey 's balanced and cautious appreciation ( Edin . Rev ., No . liv ., December , 1816 [ published February 14 , 1817 ]) have been reprinted in their collected works . Both writers conclude with an aspiration — Jeffrey , that</p>
      <p n="10">“ This puissant spirit Yet shall reascend , Self-raised , and repossess its native seat ! ”</p>
      <p n="11">Scott , in the “ tenderest strain ” of Virgilian melody —</p>
      <p n="12">“ I decus , i nostrum , melioribus utere fatis ! ”</p>

I found it in my own pedigree in the reigns of John and Henry .... It is short , ancient , vocalic , and had been in my family ; for which reasons I gave it to my daughter . ” — Letter to Murray , Ravenna , October 8 , 1820 .</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">The Honourable Augusta Ada Byron was born December 10 , 1815 ; was married</l>
       <l n="2">July 8 , 1835 , to William King Noel ( 1805-1893 ) , eighth Baron King ,</l>
       <l n="3">created Earl of Lovelace , 1838 ; and died November 27 , 1852 . There were</l>
       <l n="4">three children of the marriage — Viscount Ockham ( d. 1862 ) , the present</l>
       <l n="5">Earl of Lovelace , and the Lady Anna Isabella Noel , who was married to</l>
       <l n="6">Wilfrid Scawen Blunt , Esq ., in 1869 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>“ The Countess of Lovelace , ” wrote a contributor to the Examiner , December 4 , 1852 , “ was thoroughly original , and the poet 's temperament was all that was hers in common with her father . Her genius , for genius she possessed , was not poetic , but metaphysical and mathematical , her mind having been in the constant practice of investigation , and with rigour and exactness . ” Of her devotion to science , and her original powers as a mathematician , her translation and explanatory notes of F. L. Menabrea 's Notices sur le machine Analytique de Mr. Babbage , 1842 , a defence of the famous “ calculating machine , ” remain as evidence .</p>
     <p>“ Those who view mathematical science not merely as a vast body of abstract and immutable truths , ... but as possessing a yet deeper interest for the human race , when it is remembered that this science constitutes the language through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of the natural world ... those who thus think on mathematical truth as the instrument through which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his Creator 's works , will regard with especial interest all that can tend to facilitate the translation of its principles into explicit practical forms . ” So , for the moment turning away from algebraic formulæ and abstruse calculations , wrote Ada , Lady Lovelace , in her twenty-eighth year . See “ Translator 's Notes , ” signed A . A. L ., to A Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage , Esq ., London , 1843 .</p>
     <p>It would seem , however , that she “ wore her learning lightly as a flower . ” “ Her manners [ Examiner ] , her tastes , her accomplishments , in many of which , music especially , she was proficient , were feminine in the nicest sense of the word . ” Unlike her father in features , or in the bent of her mind , she inherited his mental vigour and intensity of purpose . Like him , she died in her thirty-seventh year , and at her own request her coffin was placed by his in the vault at Hucknall Torkard . ( See , too , Athenæum , December 4 , 1852 , and Gent . Mag ., January , 1853 . )]</p>

On the tale or spell of his own tragedy is set the seal of silence ; but of Harold , the idealized Byron , he once more takes up the parable . In stanzas viii. - xv . he puts the reader in possession of some natural changes , and unfolds the development of thought and feeling which had befallen the Pilgrim since last they had journeyed together . The youthful Harold had sounded the depth of joy and woe . Man delighted him not — no , nor woman neither . For a time , however , he had cured himself of this trick of sadness . He had drunk new life from the fountain of natural beauty and antique lore , and had returned to take his part in the world , inly armed against dangers and temptations . And in the world he had found beauty , and fame had found him . What wonder that he had done as others use , and then discovered that he could not fare as others fared ?

     <note>290 ] [ The most vivid and the best authenticated account of the Duchess of Richmond 's ball , which took place June 15 , the eve of the Battle of Quatrebras , in the duke 's house in the Rue de la Blanchisserie , is to be found in Lady de Ros 's ( Lady Georgiana Lennox ) Personal Recollections of the Great Duke of Wellington , which appeared first in Murray 's Magazine , January and February , 1889 , and were republished as A Sketch of the Life of Georgiana , Lady de Ros , by her daughter , the Hon . Mrs. J. R. Swinton ( John Murray , 1893 ) . “ My mother 's now famous ball , ” writes Lady de Ros ( A Sketch , etc ., pp . 122 , 123 ) , “ took place in a large room on the ground-floor on the left of the entrance , connected with the rest of the house by an ante-room . It had been used by the coachbuilder , from whom the house was hired , to put carriages in , but it was papered before we came there ; and I recollect the paper — a trellis pattern with roses .... When the duke arrived , rather late , at the ball , I was dancing , but at once went up to him to ask about the rumours . ‘ Yes , they are true ; we are off to-morrow . ’ This terrible news was circulated directly , and while some of the officers hurried away , others remained at the ball , and actually had not time to change their clothes , but fought in evening costume . ”</note>

In the plan of the Duke of Richmond 's house , which Lady de Ros published in her Recollections , the actual spot is marked ( the door of the ante-room leading to the ball-room ) where Lady Georgiana Lennox took leave of the Duke of Brunswick . “ It was a dreadful evening , ” she writes , “ taking leave of friends and acquaintances , many never to be seen again . The Duke of Brunswick , as he took leave of me ... made me a civil speech as to the Brunswickers being sure to distinguish themselves after ‘ the honour ’ done them by my having accompanied the Duke of Wellington to their review ! I remember being quite provoked with poor Lord Hay , a dashing , merry youth , full of military ardour , whom I knew very well , for his delight at the idea of going into action ... and the first news we had on the 16th was that he and the Duke of Brunswick were killed . ” — A Sketch , etc ., pp . 132 , 133 .</note>

     <p>But the contrast between the continuous action of nature and the doom of the unreturning dead , which does not greatly concern Southey , fills Byron with a fierce desire to sum the price of victory . He flings in the face of the vain-glorious mourners the bitter reality of their abiding loss . It was this prophetic note , “ the voice of one crying in the wilderness , ” which sounded in and through Byron 's rhetoric to the men of his own generation . ]</p>

Oh , many , many are the broken-hearted for those who know what the moral and practical heart of the man is . ” — Anima Poetæ , 1895 , p. 303 .</note>
     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 296 ]</span>[ According to Lady Blessington ( Conversations , p. 176 ) , Byron maintained that the image of the broken mirror had in some mysterious way been suggested by the following quatrain which Curran had once repeated to him :—</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ While memory , with more than Egypt 's art</l>

Burton is discoursing on injury and long-suffering . “ ‘ Tis a Hydra 's head contention ; the more they strive , the more they may ; and as Praxiteles did by his glass [ see Cardan , De Consolatione , lib . iii . ] , when he saw a scurvy face in it , break it in pieces ; but for the one he saw , he saw many more as bad in a moment ; for one injury done , they provoke another cum fanore , and twenty enemies for one . ” — Anatomy of Melancholy , 1893 , ii . 228 .

     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 298 ]</span>[ Byron seems to have been unable to make up his mind about Napoleon . “ It is impossible not to be dazzled and overwhelmed by his character and career , ” he wrote to Moore ( March 17 , 1815 ) , when his Héros de Roman , as he called him , had broken open his “ captive 's cage ” and was making victorious progress to the capital . In the Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte , which was written in April , 1814 , after the first abdication at Fontainebleau , the dominant note is astonishment mingled with contempt . It is the lamentation over a fallen idol . In these stanzas ( xxxvi. - xlv . ) he bears witness to the man 's essential greatness , and , with manifest reference to his own personality and career , attributes his final downfall to the peculiar constitution of his genius and temper . A year later ( 1817 ) , in the Fourth Canto ( stanzas lxxxix. - xcii . ) , he passes a severe sentence . Napoleon 's greatness is swallowed up in weakness . He is a “ kind of bastard Cæsar , ” self-vanquished , the creature and victim of vanity . Finally , in The Age of Bronze , sections iii. - vi ., there is a reversion to the same theme , the tragic irony of the rise and fall of the “ king of kings , and yet of slaves the slave . ”</p>
     <p>As a schoolboy at Harrow , Byron fought for the preservation of Napoleon 's bust , and he was ever ready , in defiance of national feeling and national prejudice , to celebrate him as “ the glorious chief ; ” but when it came to the point , he did not “ want him here , ” victorious over England , and he could not fail to see , with insight quickened by self-knowledge , that greatness and genius possess no charm against littleness and commonness , and that the “ glory of the terrestrial ” meets with its own reward . The moral is obvious , and as old as history ; but herein lay the secret of Byron 's potency , that he could remint and issue in fresh splendour the familiar coinage of the world 's wit . Moreover , he lived in a great age , when great truths are born again , and appear in a new light . ]</p>
     <note>299 ] [ The stanza was written while Napoleon was still under the guardianship of Admiral Sir George Cockburn , and before Sir Hudson Lowe had landed at St. Helena ; but complaints were made from the first that imperial honours which were paid to him by his own suite were not accorded by the British authorities .</note>

It is possible , too , that now and again even Shelley 's companionship was felt to be a strain upon nerves and temper . The escape from memory and remorse , which could not be always attained in the society of a chosen few , might , he hoped , be found in solitude , face to face with nature . But it was not to be . Even nature was powerless to “ minister to a mind diseased . ” At the conclusion of his second tour ( September 29 , 1816 ) , he is constrained to admit that “ neither the music of the shepherd , the crashing of the avalanche , nor the torrent , the mountain , the glacier , the forest , nor the cloud , have for one moment lightened the weight upon my heart , nor enabled me to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty , and the power , and the glory , around , above , and beneath me ” ( Life , p. 315 ) . Perhaps Wordsworth had this confession in his mind when , in 1834 , he composed the lines , “ Not in the Lucid Intervals of Life , ” of which the following were , he notes , “ written with Lord Byron 's character as a past before me , and that of others , his contemporaries , who wrote under like influences : ” —</p>

He is overcome by the world , and , as a last resource , he turns to nature and solitude . He lifts up his eyes to the hills , unexpectant of Divine aid , but in the hope that , by claiming kinship with Nature , and becoming “ a portion of that around ” him , he may forego humanity , with its burden of penitence , and elude the curse .

Tantôt de hautes et bruyantes cascades m'inondoient de leur epais brouillard : tantôt un torrent éternel ouvroit à mes côtés un abîme dont les yeux n'osoient sonder la profondeur . Quelquefois je me perdois dans l'obscurité d'un bois touffu . Quelquefois , en sortant d'un gouffre , une agréable prairie , réjouissoit tout-à-coup mes regards . Un mélange étonnant de la nature sauvage et de la nature cultivée , montroit partout la main des hommes , où l'on eût cru qu'ils n'avoient jamais pénétré : a côté d'une caverne on trouvoit des maisons ; on voyoit des pampres secs où l'on n'eût cherché que des ronces , des vignes dans des terres éboullées , d'excellens fruits sur des rochers , et des champs dans des précipices . ” See , too , Lettre xxxviii . p. 56 ; Partie IV . Lettre xi . p. 238 ( the description of Julie 's Elysium ) ; and Partie IV . Lettre xvii . p. 260 ( the excursion to Meillerie ) .</p>
     <p>Byron infuses into Rousseau 's accurate and charming compositions of scenic effects , if not the “ glory , ” yet “ the freshness of a dream . ” He belonged to the new age , with its new message from nature to man , and , in spite of theories and prejudices , listened and was convinced . He extols Rousseau 's recognition of nature , lifting it to the height of his own argument ; but , consciously or unconsciously , he desires to find , and finds , in nature a spring of imagination undreamt of by the Apostle of Sentiment . There is a whole world of difference between Rousseau 's persuasive and delicate patronage of Nature , and Byron 's passionate , though somewhat belated , surrender to her inevitable claim . With Rousseau , Nature is a means to an end , a conduct of refined and heightened fancy ; whereas , to Byron , “ her reward was with her , ” a draught of healing and refreshment . ]</p>

     <note>343 ] { 281 } [ In his appreciation of Voltaire , Byron , no doubt , had in mind certain strictures of the lake school — “ a school , as it is called , I presume , from their education being still incomplete . ” Coleridge , in The Friend ( 1850 , i . 168 ) , contrasting Voltaire with Erasmus , affirms that “ the knowledge of the one was solid through its whole extent , and that of the other extensive at a chief rate in its superficiality , ” and characterizes “ the wit of the Frenchman ” as being “ without imagery , without character , and without that pathos which gives the magic charm to genuine humour ; ” and Wordsworth , in the second book of The Excursion ( Works of Wordsworth , 1889 , p. 434 ) , “ unalarmed ” by any consideration of wit or humour , writes down Voltaire 's Optimist ( Candide , ou L'Optimisme ) , which was accidentally discovered by the “ Wanderer ” in the “ Solitary 's ” pent-house , “ swoln with scorching damp , ” as “ the dull product of a scoffer 's pen . ” Byron reverts to these contumelies in a note to the Fifth Canto of Don Juan ( see Life , Appendix , p. 809 ) , and lashes “ the school ” secundum artem .</note>

Even the Pope Benedict XIV . accepted the dedication of Mahomet ( 1745 ) , and bestowed an apostolical benediction on “ his dear son . ” On the other hand , his abhorrence of war , his protection of the oppressed , and , above all , the questioning spirit of his historical and philosophical writings ( e. g . Les Lettres sur les Anglais , 1733 ; Annales de l'Empire depuis Charlemagne , 1753 , etc . ) were felt to be subversive of civil as well as ecclesiastical tyranny , and , no doubt , helped to precipitate the Revolution .</p>

It is said in this poem that hatred of him will be taught as a lesson to his child . I might appeal to all who have ever heard me speak of him , and still more to my own heart , to witness that there has been no moment when I have remembered injury otherwise than affectionately and sorrowfully . It is not my duty to give way to hopeless and wholly unrequited affection , but so long as I live my chief struggle will probably be not to remember him too kindly . ” — ( Letter of Lady Byron to Lady Anne Lindsay , extracted from Lord Lindsay 's letter to the Times , September 7 , 1869 . )</p>
     <p>According to Mrs. Leigh ( see her letter to Hodgson , Nov ., 1816 , Memoirs of Rev . F. Hodgson , 1878 , ii . 41 ) , Murray paid Lady Byron “ the compliment ” of showing her the transcription of the Third Canto , a day or two after it came into his possession . Most probably she did not know or recognize Claire 's handwriting , but she could not fail to remember that but one short year ago she had herself been engaged in transcribing The Siege of Corinth and Parisina for the press .

     <p>My guide from Mount St. Jean over the field seemed intelligent and accurate . The place where Major Howard fell was not far from two tall and solitary trees ( there was a third cut down , or shivered in the battle ) , which stand a few yards from each other at a pathway 's side . Beneath these he died and was buried . The body has since been removed to England . A small hollow for the present marks where it lay , but will probably soon be effaced ; the plough has been upon it , and the grain is . After pointing out the different spots where Picton and other gallant men had perished ; the guide said , “ Here Major Howard lay : I was near him when wounded . ” I told him my relationship , and he seemed then still more anxious to point out the particular spot and circumstances . The place is one of the most marked in the field , from the peculiarity of the two trees above mentioned . I went on horseback twice over the field , comparing it with my recollection of similar scenes . As a plain , Waterloo seems marked out for the scene of some great action , though this may be mere imagination : I have viewed with attention those of Platea , Troy , Mantinea , Leuctra , Chæronea , and Marathon ; and the field around Mount St. Jean and Hougoumont appears to want little but a better cause , and that undefinable but impressive halo which the lapse of ages throws around a celebrated spot , to vie in interest with any or all of these , except , perhaps , the last mentioned .</p>

     <p>The castle of Drachenfels stands on the highest summit of “ the Seven Mountains , ” over the Rhine banks ; it is in ruins , and connected with some singular traditions . It is the first in view on the road from Bonn , but on the opposite side of the river : on this bank , nearly facing it , are the remains of another , called the Jew 's Castle , and a large cross , commemorative of the murder of a chief by his brother . The number of castles and cities along the course of the Rhine on both sides is very great , and their situations remarkably beautiful .</p>
     <note>The castle of Drachenfels ( Dragon 's Rock ) stands on the summit of one , but not the highest , of the Siebengebirge , an isolated group of volcanic hills on the right bank of the Rhine between Remagen and Bonn . The legend runs that in one of the caverns of the rock dwelt the dragon which was slain by Siegfried , the hero of the Nibelungen Lied . Hence the vin du pays is called Drachenblut .</note>

     <p>A separate monument ( not over his body , which is buried by Marceau 's ) is raised for him near Andernach , opposite to which one of his most memorable exploits was performed , in throwing a bridge to an island on the Rhine [ April 18 , 1797 ] .

     <p>Ehrenbreitstein , i. e . “ the broad stone of honour , ” one of the strongest fortresses in Europe , was dismantled and blown up by the French at the truce of Leoben . It had been , and could only be , reduced by famine or treachery . It yielded to the former , aided by surprise . After having seen the fortifications of Gibraltar and Malta , it did not much strike by comparison ; but the situation is commanding . General Marceau besieged it in vain for some time , and I slept in a room where I was shown a window at which he is said to have been standing observing the progress of the siege by moonlight , when a ball struck immediately below it .</p>
     <note>Ehrenbreitstein , which had resisted the French under Marshal Boufflers in 1680 , and held out against Marceau ( 1795-96 ) , finally capitulated to the French after a prolonged siege in 1799 . The fortifications were dismantled when the French evacuated the fortress after the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801 . The Treaty of Leoben was signed April 18 , 1797 .</note>

     <p>The chapel is destroyed , and the pyramid of bones diminished to a small number by the Burgundian Legion in the service of France ; who anxiously effaced this record of their ancestors ’ less successful invasions . A few still remain , notwithstanding the pains taken by the Burgundians for ages ( all who passed that way removing a bone to their own country ) , and the less justifiable larcenies of the Swiss postilions , who carried them off to sell for knife-handles ; a purpose for which the whiteness imbibed by the bleaching of years had rendered them in great request . Of these relics I ventured to bring away as much as may have made a quarter of a hero , for which the sole excuse is , that if I had not , the next passer-by might have perverted them to worse uses than the careful preservation which I intend for them .</p>
     <p>[ Charles the Bold was defeated by the Swiss at the Battle of Morat , June 22 , 1476 . It has been computed that more than twenty thousand Burgundians fell in the battle . At first , to avoid the outbreak of a pestilence , the bodies were thrown into pits . “ Nine years later ... the mouldering remains were unearthed , and deposited in a building ... on the shore of the lake , near the village of Meyriez .... During three succeeding centuries this depository was several times rebuilt .... But the ill-starred relics were not destined even yet to remain undisturbed . At the close of the last century , when the armies of the French Republic were occupying Switzerland , a regiment consisting mainly of Burgundians , under the notion of effacing an insult to their ancestors , tore down the ‘ bone-house ’ at Morat , covered the contents with earth , and planted on the mound ‘ a tree of liberty . ’ But the tree had no roots ; the rains washed away the earth ; again the remains were exposed to view , and lay bleaching in the sun for a quarter of a century . Travellers stopped to gaze , to moralize , and to pilfer ; postilions and poets scraped off skulls and thigh-bones .... At last , in 1822 , the vestiges were swept together and resepulchred , and a simple obelisk of marble was erected , to commemorate a victory well deserving of its fame as a military exploit , but all unworthy to be ranked with earlier triumphs , won by hands pure as well as strong , defending freedom and the right . ” — History of Charles the Bold , by J. F. Kirk , 1868 , iii . 404 , 405 .</p>

As a Roman colony it bore the name of Pia Flavia Constans Emerita , and circ . 70 A. D. contained a population of sixty thousand inhabitants . It was destroyed first by the Alemanni and , afterwards , by Attila . “ The Emperor Vespasian — son of the banker of the town , ” says Suetonius ( lib . viii . i ) — “ surrounded the city by massive walls , defended it by semicircular towers , adorned it with a capitol , a theatre , a forum , and granted it jurisdiction over the outlying dependencies ....</p>

     <p>Julia Alpinula , a young Aventian priestess , died soon after a vain endeavour to save her father , condemned to death as a traitor by Aulus Cæcina . Her epitaph was discovered many years ago ;— it is thus :— “ Julia Alpinula : Hic jaceo . Infelicis patris , infelix proles . Deæ Aventiæ Sacerdos . Exorare patris necem non potui : Male mori in fatis ille erat . Vixi annos XXIII . ” — I know of no human composition so affecting as this , nor a history of deeper interest . These are the names and actions which ought not to perish , and to which we turn with a true and healthy tenderness , from the wretched and glittering detail of a confused mass of conquests and battles , with which the mind is roused for a time to a false and feverish sympathy , from whence it recurs at length with all the nausea consequent on such intoxication .</p>
     <note>A mutinous outbreak among the Helvetii , which had been provoked by the dishonest rapacity of the twenty-first legion , was speedily quelled by the Roman general Aulus Cæcina . Aventicum surrendered ( A. D. 69 ) , but Julius Alpinus , a chieftain and supposed ring-leader , was singled out for punishment and put to death . “ The rest , ” says Tacitus , “ were left to the ruth or ruthlessness of Vitellius ” ( Histor ., i . 67 , 68 ) . Julia Alpinula and her epitaph were the happy inventions of a sixteenth-century scholar . “ It appears , ” writes Lord Stanhope , “ that this inscription was given by one Paul Wilhelm , a noted forger ( falsarius ) , to Lipsius , and by Lipsius handed over to Gruterus . Nobody , either before or since Wilhelm , has even pretended to have seen the stone ... as to any son or daughter of Julius Alpinus , history is wholly silent ” ( Quarterly Review , June , 1846 , vol . lviii . p. 61 ; Historical Essays , by Lord Mahon , 1849 , pp . 297 , 298 ) .</note>

     <note>The blueness of the Rhone , which has been attributed to various causes , is due to the comparative purity of the water . The yellow and muddy stream , during its passage through the lake , is enabled to purge itself to a very great extent of the solid matter held in suspension — the glacial and other detritus — - and so , on leaving its vast natural filtering-bed , it flows out clear and blue : it has regained the proper colour of pure water .</note>

       <l n="2">Stanza lxxix . line 3 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>This refers to the account , in his Confessions , of his passion for the Comtesse d'Houdetot ( the mistress of St. Lambert ) , and his long walk every morning , for the sake of the single kiss which was the common salutation of French acquaintance . Rousseau 's description of his feelings on this occasion may be considered as the most passionate , yet not impure , description and expression of love that ever kindled into words ; which , after all , must be felt , from their very force , to be inadequate to the delineation ; a painting can give no sufficient idea of the ocean .</p>
     <p>[ Here is Rousseau 's “ passionate , yet not impure , ” description of his sensations : “ J'ai dit qu'il y avoit loin de l'Hermitage à Eaubonne ; je passois par les coteaux d'Andilly qui sont charmans . Je rêvois en marchant à celle que j'allois voir , à l'accueil caressant qu'elle me feroit , au baiser qui m'attendoit a mon arrivée . Ce seul baiser , ce baiser funeste avant même de le recevoir , m'embrasoit le sang à tel point , que ma tête se troubloit , un éblouissement m'aveugloit , mes genoux tremblants ne pouroient me soutenir ; j'étois forcé de m'arréter , de m'asseoir ; toute ma machine étoit dans un désordre inconcevable ; j'étois prêt à m'évanouir .... A l'instant que je la voyois , tout étoit réparé ; je ne sentois plus auprès d'elle que l'importunité d'une vigueur inépuisable et toujours inutile . ” — Les Confessions , Partie II . livre ix . ; Oeuvres Complètes de J. J. Rousseau , 1837 , i . 233 .</p>
     <p>Byron 's mother “ would have it ” that her son was like Rousseau , but he disclaimed the honour antithetically and with needless particularity ( see his letter to Mrs. Byron , and a quotation from his Detached Thoughts , Letters , 1898 , i . 192 , note ) . There was another point of unlikeness , which he does not mention . Byron , on the passion of love , does not “ make for morality , ” but he eschews nastiness . The loves of Don Juan and Haidée are chaste as snow compared with the unspeakable philanderings of the elderly Jean Jacques and the “ mistress of St. Lambert . ”</p>
     <p>Nevertheless , his mother was right . There was a resemblance , and consequently an affinity , between Childe Burun and the “ visionary of Geneva ” — delineated by another seer or visionary as “ the dreamer of love-sick tales , and the spinner of speculative cobwebs ; shy of light as the mole , but as quick-eared too for every whisper of the public opinion ; the teacher of Stoic pride in his principles , yet the victim of morbid vanity in his feelings and conduct . ” — The Friend ; Works of S. T. Coleridge , 1853 , ii . 124 . ]</p>

     <p>It is to be recollected , that the most beautiful and impressive doctrines of the divine Founder of Christianity were delivered , not in the Temple , but on the Mount . To waive the question of devotion , and turn to human eloquence ,— the most effectual and splendid specimens were not pronounced within walls . Demosthenes addressed the public and popular assemblies . Cicero spoke in the forum . That this added to their effect on the mind of both orator and hearers , may be conceived from the difference between what we read of the emotions then and there produced , and those we ourselves experience in the perusal in the closet . It is one thing to read the Iliad at Sigæum and on the tumuli , or by the springs with Mount Ida above , and the plain and rivers and Archipelago around you ; and another to trim your taper over it in a snug library — this I know . Were the early and rapid progress of what is called Methodism to be attributed to any cause beyond the enthusiasm excited by its vehement faith and doctrines ( the truth or error of which I presume neither to canvass nor to question ) , I should venture to ascribe it to the practice of preaching in the fields , and the unstudied and extemporaneous effusions of its teachers . The Mussulmans , whose erroneous devotion ( at least in the lower orders ) is most sincere , and therefore impressive , are accustomed to repeat their prescribed orisons and prayers , wherever they may be , at the stated hours — of course , frequently in the open air , kneeling upon a light mat ( which they carry for the purpose of a bed or cushion as required ) ; the ceremony lasts some minutes , during which they are totally absorbed , and only living in their supplication : nothing can disturb them . On me the simple and entire sincerity of these men , and the spirit which appeared to be within and upon them , made a far greater impression than any general rite which was ever performed in places of worship , of which I have seen those of almost every persuasion under the sun ; including most of our own sectaries , and the Greek , the Catholic , the Armenian , the Lutheran , the Jewish , and the Mahometan . Many of the negroes , of whom there are numbers in the Turkish empire , are idolaters , and have free exercise of their belief and its rites ; some of these I had a distant view of at Patras ; and , from what I could make out of them , they appeared to be of a truly Pagan description , and not very agreeable to a spectator .</p>
     <p>[ For this profession of “ natural piety , ” compare Rousseau 's Confessions , Partie II . livre xii . ( Oeuvres Complètes , 1837 , i . 341 ) —</p>
     <p>“ Je ne trouve pas de plus digne hommage à la Divinité que cette admiration muette qu'excite la contemplation de ses oeuvres , et qui ne s'exprime point par des actes développés . Je comprends comment les habitants des villes , qui ne voient que des murs , des rues et des crimes , ont peu de foi ; mais je ne puis comprendre comment des campagnards , et surtout des solitaires , peuvent n'en point avoir . Comment leur âme ne s'élèvehYpppHeNthYpppHeNelle pas cent fois le jour avec extase à l'Auteur des merveilles qui les frappent ? ... Dans ma chambre je prie plus rarement et plus sèchement ; mais à l'aspect d'un beau paysage je me sens ému sans pourvoir dire de quoi . ”</p>

     <p>Rousseau 's Héloïse , Lettre 17 , Part IV ., note . “ Ces montagnes sont si hautes , qu'une demihYpppHeNheure après le soleil couché , leurs sommets sont éclairés de ses rayons , dont le rouge forme sur ces cimes blanches une belle couleur de rose , qu'on aperçoit de fort loin . "[ 356 ] This applies more particularly to the heights over Meillerie .— “ J'allai à Vévay loger à la Clef ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 357 ]</span>et pendant deux jours que j'y restai sans voir personne , je pris pour cette ville un amour qui m'a suivi dans tous mes voyages , et qui m'y a fait établir enfin les héros de mon roman .

I. liv . 4 , Oeuvres , etc ., 1837 , i . 78 ] .— In July [ June 23-27 ] , 1816 , I made a voyage round the Lake of Geneva ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 359 ]</span>and , as far as my own observations have led me in a not uninterested nor inattentive survey of all the scenes most celebrated by Rousseau in his Héloïse , I can safely say , that in this there is no exaggeration . It would be difficult to see Clarens ( with the scenes around it , Vevay , Chillon , Bôveret , St. Gingo , Meillerie , Evian ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 360 ]</span>and the entrances of the Rhone ) without being forcibly struck with its peculiar adaptation to the persons and events with which it has been peopled . But this is not all ; the feeling with which all around Clarens , and the opposite rocks of Meillerie , is invested , is of a still higher and more comprehensive order than the mere sympathy with individual passion ; it is a sense of the existence of love in its most extended and sublime capacity , and of our own participation of its good and of its glory : it is the great principle of the universe , which is there more condensed , but not less manifested ; and of which , though knowing ourselves a part , we lose our individuality , and mingle in the beauty of the whole .— If Rousseau had never written , nor lived , the same associations would not less have belonged to such scenes . He has added to the interest of his works by their adoption ; he has shown his sense of their beauty by the selection ; but they have done that for him which no human being could do for them .— I had the fortune ( good or evil as it might be ) to sail from Meillerie<span type="note_anchor">[ 361 ]</span>( where we landed for some time ) to St. Gingo during a lake storm , which added to the magnificence of all around , although occasionally accompanied by danger to the boat , which was small and overloaded . It was over this very part of the lake that Rousseau has driven the boat of St. Preux and Madame Wolmar to Meillerie for shelter during a tempest . On gaining the shore at St. Gingo , I found that the wind had been sufficiently strong to blow down some fine old chestnut trees on the lower part of the mountains . On the opposite height of Clarens is a château<span type="note_anchor">[ 362 ]</span>[ Château des Crêtes ] . The hills are covered with vineyards , and interspersed with some small but beautiful woods ; one of these was named the “ Bosquet de Julie ; ” and it is remarkable that , though long ago cut down by the brutal selfishness of the monks of St. Bernard ( to whom the land appertained ) , that the ground might be enclosed into a vineyard for the miserable drones of an execrable superstition , the inhabitants of Clarens still point out the spot where its trees stood , calling it by the name which consecrated and survived them . Rousseau has not been particularly fortunate in the preservation of the “ local habitations ” he has given to “ airy nothings . ” The Prior of Great St. Bernard has cut down some of his woods for the sake of a few casks of wine , and Buonaparte has levelled part of the rocks of Meillerie in improving the road to the Simplon . The road is an excellent one ; but I cannot quite agree with a remark which I heard made , that “ La route vaut mieux que les souvenirs . ”</p>

     <p>[ François Marie Arouet de Voltaire ( 1694-1778 ) lived on his estate at Fernex , five miles north of Geneva , from 1759 to 1777 . “ In the garden at Fernex is a long berceau walk , closely arched over with clipped horn-beam — a verdant cloister , with gaps cut here and there , admitting a glimpse of the prospect . Here Voltaire used to walk up and down , and dictate to his secretary . ” — Handbook for Switzerland , p. 174 .</p>
     <p>Previous to this he had lived for some time at Lausanne , at “ Monrepos , a country house at the end of a suburb , ” at Monrion , “ a square building of two storeys , and a high garret , with wings , each fashioned like the letter L , ” and afterwards , in the spring of 1757 , at No . 6 , Rue du Grand Chêne .— Historic Studies , ii . 210 , 218 , 219 .</p>
     <p>Edward Gibbon ( 1737-1794 ) finished ( 1788 ) The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire at “ La Grotte , an ancient and spacious mansion behind the church of St. Francis , at Lausanne , ” which was demolished by the Swiss authorities in 1879 . Not only has the mansion ceased to exist , but the garden has been almost entirely changed . The wall of the Hôtel Gibbon occupies the site of the famous wooden pavilion , or summer-house , and of the “ berceau of plum trees , which formed a verdant gallery completely arched overhead , ” and which “ were called after Gibbon , La Gibbonière . ” — Historic Studies , i. I ; ii . 493 .</p>
     <p>In 1816 the pavilion was “ utterly decayed , ” and the garden neglected , but Byron gathered “ a sprig of Gibbon 's acacia , ” and some rose leaves from his garden and enclosed them in a letter to Murray ( June 27 , 1816 ) . Shelley , on the contrary , “ refrained from doing so , fearing to outrage the greater and more sacred name of Rousseau ; the contemplation of whose imperishable creations had left no vacancy in my heart for mortal things . Gibbon had a cold and unimpassioned spirit . ” — Essays , etc ., 1840 , ii . 76 . ]</p>

      <head>INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO .</head>
      <p>The first draft of the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold , which embodies the original and normal conception of the poem , was the work of twenty-six days . On the 17th of June , 1817 , Byron wrote to Murray : “ You are out about the Third Canto : I have not done , nor designed , a line of continuation to that poem . I was too short a time at Rome for it , and have no thought of recommencing . ” But in spite of this assertion , “ the numbers came , ” and on June 26 he made a beginning . Thirty stanzas “ were roughened off ” on the 1st of July , fifty-six were accomplished by the 9th , “ ninety and eight ” by the 13th , and on July 20 he announces “ the completion of the fourth and ultimate canto of Childe Harold . It consists of 126 stanzas . ” One stanza ( xl . ) was appended to the fair copy . It suggested a parallel between Ariosto “ the Southern Scott , ” and Scott “ the Northern Ariosto , ” and excited some misgiving .</p>
      <p n="1">In commending his new poem to Murray ( July 20 , August 7 ) , Byron notes three points in which it differed from its predecessors : it is “ the longest of the four ; ” “ it treats more of works of art than of nature ; ” “ there are no metaphysics in it — at least , I think not . ” In other words , “ The Fourth Canto is not a continuation of the Third . I have parted company with Shelley and Wordsworth . Subject-matter and treatment are alike new . ”</p>
      <p n="2">The poem as it stood was complete , and , as a poem , it lost as well as gained by the insertion of additional stanzas and groups of stanzas , “ purple patch ” on “ purple patch , ” each by itself so attractive and so splendid . The pilgrim finds himself at Venice , on the “ Bridge of Sighs . ” He beholds in a vision the departed glories of “ a thousand years . ” The “ long array of shadows , ” the “ beings of the mind , ” come to him “ like truth , ” and repeople the vacancy . But he is an exile , and turns homeward in thought to “ the inviolate island of the sage and free . ” He is an exile and a sufferer . He can and will endure his fate , but “ ever and anon ” he feels the prick of woe , and with the sympathy of despair would stand “ a ruin amidst ruins , ” a desolate soul in a land of desolation and decay . He renews his pilgrimage . He passes Arquà , where “ they keep the dust of Laura 's lover , ” lingers for a day at Ferrara , haunted by memories of “ Torquato 's injured shade , ” and , as he approaches “ the fair white walls ” of Florence , he re-echoes the “ Italia ! oh , Italia ! ” of Filicaja 's impassioned strains . At Florence he gazes , “ dazzled and drunk with beauty , ” at the “ goddess in stone , ” the Medicean Venus , but forbears to “ describe the indescribable , ” to break the silence of Art by naming its mysteries . Santa Croce and the other glories “ in Arno 's dome of Art 's most princely shrine , ” he passes by unsung , if not unseen ; but Thrasymene 's “ sheet of silver , ” the “ living crystal ” of Clitumnus ’ “ gentlest waters , ” and Terni 's “ matchless cataract , ” on whose verge “ an Iris sits , ” and “ lone Soracte 's ridge , ” not only call forth his spirit 's homage , but receive the homage of his Muse .</p>
      <p n="3">And now the Pilgrim has reached his goal , “ Rome the wonderful , ” the sepulchre of empire , the shrine of art .</p>
      <p n="4">Henceforth the works of man absorb his attention . Pompey 's “ dread statue ; ” the Wolf of the Capitol ; the Tomb of Cecilia Metella ; the Palatine ; the “ nameless column ” of the Forum ; Trajan 's pillar ; Egeria 's Grotto ; the ruined Colosseum , “ arches on arches , ” an “ enormous skeleton , ” the Colosseum of the poet 's vision , a multitudinous ring of spectators , a bloody Circus , and a dying Gladiator ; the Pantheon ; S. Nicola in Carcere , the scene of the Romana Caritas ; St. Peter 's “ vast and wondrous dome , ” — are all celebrated in due succession . Last of all , he “ turns to the Vatican , ” to view the Laocoon and the Apollo Belvidere , the counterfeit presentments of ideal suffering and ideal beauty . His “ shrine is won ; ” but ere he bids us farewell he climbs the Alban Mount , and as the Mediterranean once more bursts upon his sight , he sums the moral of his argument . Man and all his works are as a drop of rain in the Ocean , “ the image of eternity , the throne of the Invisible ” !</p>
      <p n="5">Byron had no sooner completed “ this fourth and ultimate canto , ” than he began to throw off additional stanzas . His letters to Murray during the autumn of 1817 announce these successive lengthenings ; but it is impossible to trace the exact order of their composition . On the 7th of August the canto stood at 130 stanzas , on the 21st at 133 ; on the 4th of September at 144 , on the 17th at 150 ; and by November 15 it had reached 167 stanzas . Of nineteen stanzas which were still to be added , six — on the death of the Princess Charlotte ( died November 6 , 1817 ) — were written at the beginning of December , and two stanzas ( clxxvii ., clxxviii . ) were forwarded to Murray in the early spring of 1818 .</p>
      <p n="6">Of these additions the most notable are four stanzas on Venice ( including stanza xiii . on “ The Horses of St. Mark ” ) ; “ The sunset on the Brenta ” ( stanzas xxvii. - xxix . ) ; The tombs in Santa Croce ,— the apostrophe to “ the all Etruscan three , ” Petrarch , Dante , Boccaccio ( stanzas liv. - lx . ) ; “ Rome a chaos of ruins — antiquarian ignorance ” ( stanzas lxxx. - lxxxii . ) ; “ The nothingness of Man — the hope of the future — Freedom ” ( stanzas xciii. - xcviii . ) ; “ The Tarpeian Rock — the Forum — Rienzi ” ( stanzas cxii. - cxiv . ) ; “ Love , Life , and Reason ” ( stanzas cxx. - cxxvii . ) ; “ The Curse of Forgiveness ” ( stanzas cxxxv. - cxxxvii . ) ; “ The Mole of Hadrian ” ( stanza clii . ) ; “ The death of the Princess Charlotte ” ( stanzas clxvii. - clxxii . ) ; “ Nemi ” ( stanzas clxxiii ., clxxiv . ) ; “ The Desert and one fair Spirit ” ( stanzas clxxvii ., clxxviii . ) .</p>
      <p n="7">Some time during the month of December , 1817 , Byron wrote out a fair copy of the entire canto , numbering 184 stanzas ( MS. D .) ; and on January 7 , 1818 , Hobhouse left Venice for England , with the “ whole of the MSS ., ” viz . Beppo ( begun October , 1817 ) , and the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold , together with a work of his own , a volume of essays on Italian literature , the antiquities of Rome , etc ., which he had put together during his residence in Venice ( July — December , 1817 ) , and proposed to publish as an appendix to Childe Harold . In his preface to Historical Illustrations , etc ., 1818 , Hobhouse explains that on his return to England he considered that this “ appendix to the Canto would be swelled to a disproportioned bulk , ” and that , under this impression , he determined to divide his material into two parts . The result was that “ such only of the notes as were more immediately connected with the text ” were printed as “ Historical Notes to Canto the Fourth , ” and that his longer dissertations were published in a separate volume , under his own name , as Historical Illustrations to the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold . To these “ Historical Notes ” an interest attaches apart from any consideration of their own worth and importance ; but to understand the relation between the poem and the notes , it is necessary to retrace the movements of the poet and his annotator .</p>
      <p n="8">Byron and Hobhouse left the Villa Diodati , October 5 , 1816 , crossed the Simplon , and made their way together , via Milan and Verona , to Venice . Early in December the friends parted company . Byron remained at Venice , and Hobhouse proceeded to Rome , and for the next four months devoted himself to the study of Italian literature , in connection with archæology and art . Byron testifies ( September 14 , 1817 ) that his researches were “ indefatigable , ” that he had “ more real knowledge of Rome and its environs than any Englishman who has been there since Gibbon . ” Hobhouse left Rome for Naples , May 21 ; returned to Rome , June 9 ; arrived at Terni , July 2 ; and early in July joined Byron on the Brenta , at La Mira . The latter half of the year ( July — December , 1817 ) was occupied in consulting “ the best authorities ” in the Ducal Library at Venice , with a view to perfecting his researches , and giving them to the world as an illustrative appendix to Childe Harold . It is certain that Byron had begun the fourth canto , and written some thirty or more stanzas , before Hobhouse rejoined him at his villa of La Mira on the banks of the Brenta , in July , 1817 ; and it would seem that , although he had begun by saying “ that he was too short a time in Rome for it , ” he speedily overcame his misgivings , and accomplished , as he believed , the last “ fytte ” of his pilgrimage . The first draft was Byron 's unaided composition , but the “ additional stanzas ” were largely due to Hobhouse 's suggestions in the course of conversation , if not to his written “ researches . ” Hobhouse himself made no secret of it . In his preface ( p. 5 ) to Historical Illustrations he affirms that both “ illustrations ” and notes were “ for the most part written while the noble author was yet employed in the composition of the poem . They were put into the hands of Lord Byron much in the state in which they now appear ; ” and , writing to Murray , December 7 , 1817 , he says , “ I must confess I feel an affection for it [ Canto IV . ] more than ordinary , as part of it was begot as it were under my own eyes ; for although your poets are as shy as elephants and camels ... yet I have , not unfrequently , witnessed his lordship 's coupleting , and some of the stanzas owe their birth to our morning walk or evening ride at La Mira . ” Forty years later , in his revised and enlarged “ Illustrations ” ( Italy : Remarks made in Several Visits from the year 1816 to 1854 , by the Right Hon . Lord Broughton , G. C. B ., 1859 , i. p . iv . ) , he reverts to this collaboration : “ When I rejoined Lord Byron at La Mira ... I found him employed upon the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold , and , later in the autumn , he showed me the first sketch of the poem . It was much shorter than it afterwards became , and it did not remark on several objects which appeared to me peculiarly worthy of notice . I made a list of these objects , and in conversation with him gave him reasons for the selection . The result was the poem as it now appears , and he then engaged me to write the notes . ”</p>
      <p n="9">As the “ delicate spirit ” of Shelley suffused the third canto of Childe Harold , so the fourth reveals the presence and co-operation of Hobhouse . To his brother-poet he owed a fresh conception , perhaps a fresh appreciation of nature ; to his lifelong friend , a fresh enthusiasm for art , and a host of details , “ dry bones ... which he awakened into the fulness of life . ”</p>
      <p n="10">The Fourth Canto was published on Tuesday , April 28 , 1818 . It was reviewed by [ Sir ] Walter Scott in the Quarterly Review , No . xxxvii ., April , 1818 , and by John Wilson in the Edinburgh Review , No . 59 , June , 1818 . Both numbers were published on the same day , September 26 , 1818 .</p>

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>After an interval of eight years between the composition of the first and last cantos of Childe Harold , the conclusion of the poem is about to be submitted to the public . In parting with so old a friend ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 364 ]</span>it is not extraordinary that I should recur to one still older and better ,— to one who has beheld the birth and death of the other , and to whom I am far more indebted for the social advantages of an enlightened friendship , than — though not ungrateful — I can , or could be , to Childe Harold , for any public favour reflected through the poem on the poet ,— to one , whom I have known long , and accompanied far , whom I have found wakeful over my sickness and kind in my sorrow , glad in my prosperity and firm in my adversity , true in counsel and trusty in peril ,— to a friend often tried and never found wanting ;— to yourself .</p>
     <p>In so doing , I recur from fiction to truth ; and in dedicating to you in its complete , or at least concluded state , a poetical work which is the longest , the most thoughtful and comprehensive of my compositions , I wish to do honour to myself by the record of many years ’ intimacy with a man of learning , of talent , of steadiness , and of honour . It is not for minds like ours to give or to receive flattery ; yet the praises of sincerity have ever been permitted to the voice of friendship ; and it is not for you , nor even for others , but to relieve a heart which has not elsewhere , or lately , been so much accustomed to the encounter of good-will as to withstand the shock firmly , that I thus attempt to commemorate your good qualities , or rather the advantages which I have derived from their exertion . Even the recurrence of the date of this letter , the anniversary of the most unfortunate day of my past existence ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 365 ]</span>but which cannot poison my future while I retain the resource of your friendship , and of my own faculties , will henceforth have a more agreeable recollection for both , inasmuch as it will remind us of this my attempt to thank you for an indefatigable regard , such as few men have experienced , and no one could experience without thinking better of his species and of himself .</p>
     <p>It has been our fortune to traverse together , at various periods , the countries of chivalry , history , and fable — Spain , Greece , Asia Minor , and Italy ; and what Athens and Constantinople were to us a few years ago , Venice and Rome have been more recently . The poem also , or the pilgrim , or both , have accompanied me from first to last ; and perhaps it may be a pardonable vanity which induces me to reflect with complacency on a composition which in some degree connects me with the spot where it was produced , and the objects it would fain describe ; and however unworthy it may be deemed of those magical and memorable abodes , however short it may fall of our distant conceptions and immediate impressions , yet as a mark of respect for what is venerable , and of feeling for what is glorious , it has been to me a source of pleasure in the production , and I part with it with a kind of regret , which I hardly suspected that events could have left me for imaginary objects .</p>
     <p>With regard to the conduct of the last canto , there will be found less of the pilgrim than in any of the preceding , and that little slightly , if at all , separated from the author speaking in his own person . The fact is , that I had become weary of drawing a line which every one seemed determined not to perceive : like the Chinese in Goldsmith 's Citizen of the World ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 366 ]</span>whom nobody would believe to be a Chinese , it was in vain that I asserted , and imagined that I had drawn , a distinction between the author and the pilgrim ; and the very anxiety to preserve this difference , and disappointment at finding it unavailing , so far crushed my efforts in the composition , that I determined to abandon it altogether — and have done so . The opinions which have been , or may be , formed on that subject are now a matter of indifference : the work is to depend on itself , and not on the writer ; and the author , who has no resources in his own mind beyond the reputation , transient or permanent , which is to arise from his literary efforts , deserves the fate of authors .</p>
     <p>In the course of the following canto it was my intention , either in the text or in the notes , to have touched upon the present state of Italian literature , and perhaps of manners . But the text , within the limits I proposed , I soon found hardly sufficient for the labyrinth of external objects , and the consequent reflections : and for the whole of the notes , excepting a few of the shortest , I am indebted to yourself ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 367 ]</span>and these were necessarily limited to the elucidation of the text .</p>
     <p>It is also a delicate , and no very grateful task , to dissert upon the literature and manners of a nation so dissimilar ; and requires an attention and impartiality which would induce us ,— though perhaps no inattentive observers , nor ignorant of the language or customs of the people amongst whom we have recently abode — to distrust , or at least defer our judgment , and more narrowly examine our information . The state of literary , as well as political party , appears to run , or to have run , so high , that for a stranger to steer impartially between them is next to impossible . It may be enough , then , at least for my purpose , to quote from their own beautiful language — “ Mi pare che in un paese tutto poetico , che vanta la lingua la più nobile ed insieme la più dolce , tutte tutte le vie diverse si possono tentare , e che sinche la patria di Alfieri e di Monti non ha perduto l'antico valore , in tutte essa dovrebbe essere la prima . ” Italy has great names still — Canova ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 368 ]</span>Monti , Ugo Foscolo , Pindemonte , Visconti , Morelli , Cicognara , Albrizzi , Mezzofanti , Mai , Mustoxidi , Aglietti , and Vacca , will secure to the present generation an honourable place in most of the departments of Art , Science , and Belles Lettres ; and in some the very highest — Europe — the World — has but one Canova .</p>
     <p>It has been somewhere said by Alfieri , that “ La pianta uomo nasce più robusta in Italia che in qualunque altra terra — e che gli stessi atroci delitti che vi si commettono ne sono una prova . ” Without subscribing to the latter part of his proposition , a dangerous doctrine , the truth of which may be disputed on better grounds , namely , that the Italians are in no respect more ferocious than their neighbours , that man must be wilfully blind , or ignorantly heedless , who is not struck with the extraordinary capacity of this people , or , if such a word be admissible , their capabilities ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 369 ]</span>the facility of their acquisitions , the rapidity of their conceptions , the fire of their genius , their sense of beauty , and , amidst all the disadvantages of repeated revolutions , the desolation of battles , and the despair of ages , their still unquenched “ longing after immortality ,"[ 370 ] — the immortality of independence . And when we ourselves , in riding round the walls of Rome , heard the simple lament of the labourers ’ chorus , “ Roma ! Roma ! Roma ! Roma non è più come era prima ! "[ 371 ] it was difficult not to contrast this melancholy dirge with the bacchanal roar of the songs of exultation still yelled from the London taverns , over the carnage of Mont St. Jean ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 372 ]</span>and the betrayal of Genoa , of Italy , of France , and of the world , by men whose conduct you yourself have exposed in a work worthy of the better days of our history .<span type="note_anchor">[ 373 ]</span>For me ,—</p>

       <l n="1">“ Non movero mai corda</l>
       <l n="2">Ove la turba di sue ciance assorda . ”</l>

     <p>What Italy has gained by the late transfer of nations , it were useless for Englishmen to enquire , till it becomes ascertained that England has acquired something more than a permanent army and a suspended Habeas Corpus ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 374 ]</span>it is enough for them to look at home . For what they have done abroad , and especially in the South , “ Verily they will have their reward , ” and at no very distant period .</p>
     <p>Wishing you , my dear Hobhouse , a safe and agreeable return to that country whose real welfare can be dearer to none than to yourself , I dedicate to you this poem in its completed state ; and repeat once more how truly I am ever</p>
     <p>Your obliged And affectionate friend , BYRON .</p>

     <p>[ The Venetians were nicknamed Pantaloni . Byron , who seems to have relied on the authority of a Venetian glossary , assumes that the “ by-word ” may be traced to the patriotism of merchant-princes “ who were reputed to hoist flags with the Venetian lion waving to the breeze on every rock and barren headland of Levantine waters ” ( Memoirs of Count Carlo Gozzi , translated by J. Addington Symonds , 1890 , Introd . part ii . p. 44 ) , and that in consequence of this spread-eagleism the Venetians were held up to scorn by their neighbours as “ planters of the lion ” — a reproach which conveyed a tribute to their prowess . A more probable explanation is that the “ by-word , ” with its cognates “ Pantaleone , ” the typical masque of Italian comedy — progenitor of our “ Pantaloon ; ” and “ pantaloni , ” “ pantaloons , ” the typical Venetian costume — derive their origin from the baptismal name “ Pantaleone , ” frequently given to Venetian children , in honour of St. Pantaleon of Nicomedia , physician and martyr , whose cult was much in vogue in Northern Italy , and especially in Venice , where his relics , which “ coruscated with miracles , ” were the object of peculiar veneration .</p>
     <p>St. Pantaleon was known to the Greek Church as Παντελεήμων [ Panteleê / môn ] , that is , the “ all-pitiful ; ” and in Latin his name is spelled Pantaleymon and Pantaleemon . Hagiologists seem to have been puzzled , but the compiler of the Acta Sanctorum , for July 27 , St. Pantaleon 's Day in the Roman calendar ( xxxiii . 397-426 ) , gives the preference to Pantaleon , and explains that he was hailed as Pantaleemon by a divine voice at the hour of his martyrdom , which proclaimed “ eum non amplius esse vocandum Pantaleonem , sed Pantaleemonem . ”</p>

Hobhouse appears , but his note is somewhat ambiguous , to adopt the view of “ the ingenious Scotchman . ” To pass to contemporary criticism , Dr. Garnett , in his History of Italian Literature , 1898 ( pp . 66-71 ) , without attempting to settle “ the everlasting controversy , ” regards the abbé 's documentary evidence as for the most part worthless , and , relying on the internal evidence of the sonnets and the dialogue , and on the facts of Petrarch 's life as established by his correspondence ( a complete series of Petrarch 's letters was published by Giuseppe Fracassetti , in 1859 ) , inclines to the belief that it was the poet 's status as a cleric , and not a husband and family , which proved a bar to his union with Laura . With regard , however , to “ one piece of documentary evidence , ” namely , Laura de Sade 's will , Dr. Garnett admits that , if this were producible , and , on being produced , proved genuine , the coincidence of the date of the will , April 3 , 1348 , with a note in Petrarch 's handwriting , dated April 6 , 1348 , which records the death of Laura , would almost establish the truth of the abbé 's theory “ in the teeth of all objections . ”</note>

And if these details are uncertain , there is no doubt that the sarcophagus of red marble , supported on pillars , in the churchyard of Arquà , contains , or once contained , his mortal remains .

The Fourth Canto of Childe Harold was not begun till the end of June in the same year .</note>
     <note>416 ] [ Of the ancient family of Este , Marquesses of Tuscany , Azzo V. was the first who obtained power in Ferrara in the twelfth century . A remote descendant , Nicolo III . ( b . 1384 , d. 1441 ) , founded the University of Parma . He married for his second wife Parisina Malatesta ( the heroine of Byron 's Parisina , published February , 1816 ) , who was beheaded for adultery in 1425 . His three sons , Lionel ( d. 1450 ) , the friend of Poggio Bracciolini ; Borso ( d. 1471 ) , who established printing in his states ; and Ercolo ( d. 1505 ) , the friend of Boiardo ,— were all patrons of letters and fosterers of the Renaissance . Their successor , Alphonso I . ( 1486-1534 ) , who married Lucrezia Borgia , 1502 , honoured himself by attaching Ariosto to his court , and it was his grandson , Alphonso II . ( d. 1597 ) , who first befriended and afterwards , on the score of lunacy , imprisoned Tasso in the Hospital of Sant ’ Anna ( 1579-86 ) .</note>
     <note>417 ] { 355 } [ It is a fact that Tasso was an involuntary inmate of the Hospital of Sant ’ Anna at Ferrara for seven years and four months — from March , 1579 , to July , 1586 — but the causes , the character , and the place of his imprisonment have been subjects of legend and misrepresentation . It has long been known and acknowledged ( see Hobhouse 's Historical Illustrations , 1818 , pp . 5-31 ) that a real or feigned passion for Duke Alphonso 's sister , Leonora d'Este , was not the cause or occasion of his detention , and that the famous cell or dungeon ( “ nine paces by six , and about seven high ” ) was not “ the original place of the poet 's confinement . ” It was , as Shelley says ( see his letter to Peacock , November 7 , 1818 ) , “ a very decent dungeon ; ” but it was not Tasso 's . The setting of the story was admitted to be legendary , but the story itself , that a poet was shut up in a madhouse because a vindictive magnate resented his love of independence and impatience of courtly servitude , was questioned , only to be reasserted as historical . The publication of Tasso 's letters by Guasti , in 1853 , a review of Tasso 's character and career in Symonds 's Renaissance in Italy , and , more recently , Signor Angelo Solerti 's monumental work , Vita di Torquato Tasso ( 1895 ) , which draws largely upon the letters of contemporaries , the accounts of the ducal court , and other documentary evidence , have in a great measure exonerated the duke at the expense of the unhappy poet himself . Briefly , Tasso 's intrigues with rival powers — the Medici at Florence , the papal court , and the Holy Office at Bologna — aroused the alarm and suspicion of the duke , whilst his general demeanour and his outbursts of violence and temper compelled , rather than afforded , a pretext for his confinement . Before his final and fatal return to Ferrara , he had been duly warned that he must submit to be treated as a person of disordered intellect , and that if he continued to throw out hints of designs upon his life and of persecution in high places , he would be banished from the ducal court and dominions . But return he would , and at an inauspicious moment , when the duke was preoccupied with the ceremonies and festivities of a third marriage . No one attended to him or took heed of his arrival ; and , to quote his own words , “ in a fit of madness ” he broke out into execrations of the ducal court and family , and of the people of Ferrara . For the offence he was shut up in the Hospital of Sant ’ Anna , and for many months treated as an ordinary lunatic . Of the particulars of his treatment during these first eight months of his confinement , apart from Tasso 's own letters , there is no evidence . The accounts of the hospital are lost , and the Libri di spesa ( R. Arch . di Stato in Modena ; Camer . Ducale : Casa ; Amministrazione , Solerti , iii . Docu . 47 ) do not commence till November 20 , 1579 . Two years later , the Libri di spenderia ( Solerti , in . Docu . 51 ) , from January , 1582 , onward , show that he was put on a more generous diet ; and it is known that a certain measure of liberty and other indulgences were gradually accorded . There can , however , be little doubt that for many months his food was neglected and medical attendance withheld . His statement , that he was denied the rites of the Church , cannot be gainsaid . He was regarded as a lunatic , and , as such , he would not be permitted either to make his confession or to communicate . Worse than all , there was the terrible solitude . “ E sovra tutto , ” he writes ( May , 1580 ) , “ m'affligge la solitudine , mia crudele e natural nimica . ” No wonder the attacks of delirium , the “ unwonted lights , ” the conference with a familiar spirit , followed in due course . Byron and Shelley were ignorant of the facts ; and we know that their scorn and indignation were exaggerated and misplaced . But the “ pity of it ” remains , that the grace and glory of his age was sacrificed to ignorance and fear , if not to animosity and revenge . ( See Tasso , by E. J.

The Gerusalemme Liberata was dedicated to the glory of the house of Este ; and , though the poet was in disgrace , the duke was not to be propitiated by an attack upon the poem .

If you think Scott will dislike it , say so , and I will expunge . ” Byron did not know that when Scott was at college at Edinburgh he had “ had the audacity to produce a composition in which he weighed Homer against Ariosto , and pronounced him wanting in the balance , ” or that he “ made a practice of reading through ... the Orlando of Ariosto once every year ” ( see Memoirs of the Life , etc ., 1871 , pp . 12 , 747 ) ; but the parallel had suggested itself . The key-note of “ the harpings of the north , ” the chivalrous strain of “ shield , lance , and brand , and plume and scarf , ” of “ gentle courtesy , ” of “ valour , lion-mettled lord , ” which the “ Introduction to Marmion ” preludes , had been already struck in the opening lines of the Orlando Furioso —</p>

     <p>Scott , we may be assured , was neither disconcerted nor uplifted by the parallel . Many years before ( July 6 , 1812 ) , Byron had been at pains to inform him that so august a critic as the Prince Regent “ preferred you to every bard past and present , ” and “ spoke alternately of Homer and yourself . ” Of the “ placing ” and unplacing of poets there is no end . Byron had already been sharply rebuked by the Edinburgh Review for describing Christabel as a “ wild and singularly original and beautiful poem , ” and his appreciation of Scott provoked the expostulation of a friendlier critic . “ Walter Scott , ” wrote Francis Hodgson , in his anonymous Monitor of Childe Harold ( 1818 ) , “ ( credite posteri , or rather præposteri ) , is designated in the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold as ‘ the Northern Ariosto , ’ and ( droller still ) Ariosto is denominated ‘ the Southern Scott . ’ This comes of mistaking horse-chestnuts for chestnut horses . ” ]</p>

Michael Angelo , Alfieri , and Macchiavelli are buried in the south aisle of the church ; Galileo , who was first buried within the convent , now rests with his favourite pupil , Vincenzo Viviani , in a vault in the south aisle . Canova 's monument to Alfieri was erected at the expense of his so-called widow , Louise , born von Stolberg , and ( 1772-78 ) consort of Prince Charles Edward .</note>

Moore perceives and dwells on the resemblance . A passage in Alfieri 's autobiography ( La Vie de V. A. écrite par Lui-même , Paris , 1809 , p. 17 ) may have suggested the parallel —</p>
     <p>“ Voici une esquisse du caractère que je manifestais dans les premières anneés de ma raison naissante . Taciturne et tranquille pour l'ordinaire , mais quelquefois extrêmement pétulant et babillard , presque toujours dans les extrêmes , obstiné et rebelle à la force , fort soumis aux avis qu'on me donnait avec amitié , contenu plutôt par la crainte d'être grondé que par toute autre chose , d'une timidité excessive , et inflexible quand on voulait me prendre à rebours . ”</p>
     <p>The resemblance , as Byron admits , “ related merely to our apparent personal dispositions . ” Both were noble , both were poets , both were “ patrician republicans , ” and both were lovers of pleasure as well as lovers and students of literature ; but their works do not provoke comparison . “ The quality of ‘ a narrow elevation ’ which [ Matthew ] Arnold finds in Alfieri , ” is not characteristic of the author of Childe Harold and Don Juan .</p>

The traveller is strongly recommended to trace the Velino , at least as high as the little lake called Pie ’ di Lup .

I wish to express , that we become tired of the task before we can comprehend the beauty ; that we learn by rote before we can get by heart ; that the freshness is worn away , and the future pleasure and advantage deadened and destroyed , by the didactic anticipation , at an age when we can neither feel nor understand the power of compositions which it requires an acquaintance with life , as well as Latin and Greek , to relish , or to reason upon . For the same reason , we never can be aware of the fulness of some of the finest passages of Shakspeare ( “ To be or not to be , ” for instance ) , from the habit of having them hammered into us at eight years old , as an exercise , not of mind , but of memory : so that when we are old enough to enjoy them , the taste is gone , and the appetite palled . In some parts of the continent , young persons are taught from more common authors , and do not read the best classics till their maturity . I certainly do not speak on this point from any pique or aversion towards the place of my education . I was not a slow , though an idle boy ; and I believe no one could , or can be , more attached to Harrow than I have always been , and with reason ;— a part of the time passed there was the happiest of my life ; and my preceptor , the Rev . Dr. Joseph Drury , was the best and worthiest friend I ever possessed , whose warnings I have remembered but too well , though too late when I have erred ,— and whose counsels I have but followed when I have done well or wisely . If ever this imperfect record of my feelings towards him should reach his eyes , let it remind him of one who never thinks of him but with gratitude and veneration — of one who would more gladly boast of having been his pupil , if , by more closely following his injunctions , he could reflect any honour upon his instructor .</p>

     <note>484 ] The Palatine is one mass of ruins , particularly on the side towards the Circus Maximus . The very soil is formed of crumbled brickwork . Nothing has been told — nothing can be told — to satisfy the belief of any but the Roman antiquary . [ The Palatine was the site of the successive “ Domus ” of Augustus , Tiberius , and Caligula , and of the Domus Transitoria of Nero , which perished when Rome was burnt . Later emperors — Vespasian , Domitian , Septimius Severus — added to the splendour of the name-giving Palatine . “ The troops of Genseric , ” says Hobhouse ( Hist . Illust ., p. 206 ) , “ occupied the Palatine , and despoiled it of all its riches ... and when it again rises , it rises in ruins . ” Systematic excavations during the last fifty years have laid bare much that was hidden , and “ learning and research ” have in parts revealed the “ obliterated plan ; ” but , in 1817 , the “ shapeless mass of ruins ” defied the guesses of antiquarians . “ Your walks in the Palatine ruins ... will be undisturbed , unless you startle a fox in breaking through the brambles in the corridors , or burst unawares through the hole of some shivered fragments into one of the half-buried chambers , which the peasants have blocked up to serve as stalls for their jackasses , or as huts for those who watch the gardens ” ( Hist .

During some excavations which were carried out under the auspices of the Duchess of Devonshire , in 1813 , the soil which concealed the base was removed , and an inscription , which attributes the erection of the column to the Exarch Smaragdus , in honour of the Emperor Phocas , A. D. 608 , was brought to light . The column was originally surmounted by a gilded statue , but it is probable that both column and statue were stolen from earlier structures and rededicated to Phocas . Hobhouse ( Hist .

     <note>The column was excavated by Paul III . in the sixteenth century . In 1588 Sixtus V. replaced the bronze statue of Trajan holding a gilded globe , which had originally surmounted the column , by a statue of St. Peter , in gilt bronze . The legend was that Trajan 's ashes were contained in the globe . They are said to have been deposited by Hadrian in a golden urn in a vault under the column . It is certain that when Sixtus V. opened the chamber he found it empty . A medal was cast in honour of the erection of the new statue , inscribed with the words of the Magnificat , “ Exaltavit humiles . ”</note>
     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 489 ]</span>{ 411 } Trajan was proverbially the best of the Roman princes ; and it would be easier to find a sovereign uniting exactly the opposite characteristics , than one possessed of all the happy qualities ascribed to this emperor . “ When he mounted the throne , ” says the historian Dion , “ he was strong in body , he was vigorous in mind ; age had impaired none of his faculties ; he was altogether free from envy and from detraction ; he honoured all the good , and he advanced them : and on this account they could not be the objects of his fear , or of his hate ; he never listened to informers ; he gave not way to his anger ; he abstained equally from unfair exactions and unjust punishments ; he had rather be loved as a man than honoured as a sovereign ; he was affable with his people , respectful to the senate , and universally beloved by both ; he inspired none with dread but the enemies of his country . ” ( See Eutrop ., Hist . Rom . Brev . lib . viii . cap . v .; Dion , Hist . Rom ., lib . lxiii . caps , vi ., vii . )</p>
     <p>[ M. Ulpius Trajanus ( A. D. 52-117 ) celebrated a triumph over the Dacians in 103 and 106 . It is supposed that the column which stands at the north end of the Forum Trajanum commemorated the Dacian victories . In 115-16 he conquered the Parthians , and added the province of Armenia Minor to the empire . It was not , however , an absolute or a final victory . The little desert stronghold of Atræ , or Hatra , in Mesopotamia , remained uncaptured ; and , instead of incorporating the Parthians in the empire , he thought it wiser to leave them to be governed by a native prince under the suzerainty of Rome . His conquests were surrendered by Hadrian , and henceforth the tide of victory began to ebb . He died on his way back to Rome , at Selinus , in Cilicia , in August , 117 .</p>
     <p>Trajan 's “ moderation was known unto all men . ” Pliny , in his Panegyricus ( xxii . ) , describes his first entry into Rome . He might have assumed the state of a monarch or popular hero , but he walked afoot , conspicuous , pre-eminent , a head and shoulders above the crowd — a triumphal entry ; but it was imperial arrogance , not civil liberty , over which he triumphed . “ You were our king , ” he says , “ and we your subjects ; but we obeyed you as the embodiment of our laws . ” Martial ( Epig ., x . 72 ) hails him not as a tyrant , but an emperor — yea , more than an emperor — as the most righteous of lawgivers and senators , who had brought back plain Truth to the light of day ; and Claudian ( viii . 318 ) maintains that his glory will live , not because the Parthians had been annexed , but because he was “ mitis patriæ . ” The divine honours which he caused to be paid to his adopted father , Nerva , he refused for himself . “ For just reasons , ” says Pliny , “ did the Senate and people of Rome assign thee the name and title of Optimus . ” Another honour awaited him : “ Il est seul Empereur , ” writes M. De La Berge , “ dont les restes aient reposé dans l'enceinte de la ville Eternelle . ” ( See Pliny 's Panegyricus , passim ; and Essai sur le règne de Trajan , Bibliothèque de L'Ecole des Hautes Études , Paris , 1877 . )]</p>

Illust ., p. 224 ) , “ stood the citadel , on what the great temple of the Capitol ; and did the temple stand in the citadel ? ” Excavations which were carried on in 1876-7 by Professors Jordan and Lanciani enabled them to identify with “ tolerable certainty ” the site of the central temple and its adjacent wings , with the site of the Palazzo Caffarelli and its dependencies which occupy the south-east section of the Mons Capitolinus . There are still , however , rival Tarpeian Rocks — one ( in the Vicolo della Rupe Tarpea ) on the western edge of the hill facing the Tiber , and the other ( near the Casa Tarpea ) on the south-east towards the Palatine . But if Dionysius , who describes the “ Traitor 's Leap ” as being in sight of the Forum , is to be credited , the “ actual precipice ” from which traitors ( and other criminals , e. g . “ bearers of false witness ” ) were thrown must have been somewhere on the southern and now less precipitous escarpment of the mount .</note>

     <p><span type="note_anchor">[ 493 ]</span>{ 414 } [ Nicolas Gabrino di ’ Rienzo , or Rienzi , commonly called Cola di ’ Rienzi , was born in 1313 . The son of a Roman innkeeper , he owed his name and fame to his own talents and natural gifts . His mission , or , perhaps , ambition , was to free Rome from the tyranny and oppression of the great nobles , and to establish once more “ the good estate , ” that is , a republic . This for a brief period Rienzi accomplished . On May 20 , 1347 , he was proclaimed tribune and liberator of the Holy Roman Republic “ by the authority of the most merciful Lord Jesus Christ . ” Of great parts , and inspired by lofty aims , he was a poor creature at heart — a “ bastard ” Napoleon — and success seems to have turned his head . After eight months of royal splendour , purchased by more than royal exactions , the tide of popular feeling turned against him , and he was forced to take refuge in the Castle of St. Angelo ( December 15 , 1347 ) . Years of wandering and captivity followed his first tribunate ; but at length , in 1354 , he was permitted to return to Rome , and , once again , after a rapid and successful reduction of the neighbouring states , he became the chief power in the state . But an act of violence , accompanied by treachery , and , above all , the necessity of imposing heavier taxes than the city could bear , roused popular discontent ; and during a revolt ( October 8 , 1354 ) , after a dastardly attempt to escape and conceal himself , he was recognized by the crowd and stabbed to death .</p>
     <p>Petrarch first made his acquaintance in 1340 , when he was summoned to Rome to be crowned as poet laureate . Afterwards , when Rienzi was imprisoned at Avignon , Petrarch interceded on his behalf with the pope , but , for a time , in vain . He believed in and shared his enthusiasms ; and it is probable that the famous Canzone , “ Spirto gentil , che quelle membra reggi , ” was addressed to the Last of the Tribunes .</p>
     <p>Rienzi 's story forms the subject of a tragedy by Gustave Drouineau , which was played at the Odéon , January 28 , 1826 ; of Bulwer Lytton 's novel The Last of the Tribunes , which was published in 1835 ; and of an opera ( 1842 ) by Richard Wagner .</p>

Meadley , London , 1821 , entitled Two Pairs of Historical Portraits , in which an attempt is made to trace a minute resemblance between the characters and careers of Rienzi and the First Napoleon . )]</p>

Caffarella ] , is a ruined nymphæum ... which was called the ‘ Grotto of Egeria , ’ till ... the discovery of the true site of the Porta Capena fixed that of the grotto within the walls .... It is now known that this nymphæum ... belonged to the suburban villa called Triopio of Herodes Atticus . ” The actual site of Egeria 's fountain is in the grounds of the Villa Mattei , to the south-east of the Cælian , and near the Porta Metronia . “ It was buried , in 1867 , by the military engineers , while building their new hospital near S. Stefano Rotondo ” ( Prof. Lanciani ) .</p>
     <p>In lines 5-9 Byron is recalling Juvenal 's description of the valley of Egeria , under the mistaken impression that here , and not by “ dripping Capena , ” was the trysting-place of Numa and the goddess . Juvenal has accompanied the seer Umbritius , who was leaving Rome for Capua , as far as the Porta Capena ; and while the one waggon , with its slender store of goods , is being loaded , the friends take a stroll —</p>

Shall we then forget the manly and dignified sentiments of our ancestors , to prate in the language of the mother or the nurse about our good old prejudices ? This is not the way to defend the cause of truth . It was not thus that our fathers maintained it in the brilliant periods of our history . Prejudice may be trusted to guard the outworks for a short space of time , while reason slumbers in the citadel ; but if the latter sink into a lethargy , the former will quickly erect a standard for herself .

     <p>The first , second , and third stories of the Flavian amphitheatre or Colosseum were built upon arches . Between the arches , eighty to each story or tier , stood three-quarter columns . “ Each tier is of a different order of architecture , the lowest being a plain Roman Doric , or perhaps , rather , Tuscan , the next Ionic , and the third Corinthian . ” The fourth story , which was built by the Emperor Gordianus III ., A. D. 244 , to take the place of the original wooden gallery ( manianum summum in ligneis ) , which was destroyed by lightning , A. D. 217 , was a solid wall faced with Corinthian pilasters , and pierced by forty square windows or openings . It has been conjectured that the alternate spaces between the pilasters were decorated with ornamental metal shields . The openings of the outer arches of the second and third stories were probably decorated with statues . The reverse of an aureus of the reign of Titus represents the Colosseum with these statues and a quadriga in the centre . About one-third of the original structure remains in situ . The prime agent of destruction was probably the earthquake ( “ Petrarch 's earthquake ” ) of September , 1349 , when the whole of the western side fell towards the Cælian , and gave rise to a hill or rather to a chain of hills of loose blocks of travertine and tufa , which supplied Rome with building materials for subsequent centuries . As an instance of wholesale spoliation or appropriation , Professor Lanciani refers to “ a document published by Müntz , in the Revue Arch ., September , 1876 , ” which “ certifies that one contractor alone , in the space of only nine months , in 1452 , could carry off 2522 cartloads ” of travertine ( Smith 's Dict . of Gr . and Rom . Ant ., art . “ Amphitheatrum ; ” Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome , by R. Lanciani , 1897 , p. 375 ) . ]</p>

Peculiarly beautiful at such a time is the Coliseum . ” See , too , Corinne , ou L'Italie , xv . 4 , 1819 , iii . 32 —</p>
     <p>“ Ce n'est pas connaítre l'impression du Colisée que de ne l'avoir vu que de jour ... la lune est l'astre des ruines . Quelque fois , à travers les ouvertures de l'amphithéàtre , qui semble s'élever jusqu'aux nues , une partie de la voûte du ciel paraît comme un rideau d'un bleu sombre placé derrière l'édifice . ”</p>

     <note>508 ] { 425 } [ When Byron visited Rome , and for long afterwards , the ruins of the Colosseum were clad with a multitude of shrubs and wild flowers . Books were written on the “ Flora of the Coliseum , ” which were said to number 420 species . But , says Professor Lanciani , “ These materials for a hortus siccus , so dear to the visitors of our ruins , were destroyed by Rosa in 1871 , and the ruins scraped and shaven clean , it being feared by him that the action of roots would accelerate the disintegration of the great structure . ” If Byron had lived to witness these activities , he might have devoted a stanza to the “ tender mercies ” of this zealous archæologist .</note>
     <note>509 ] { 426 } [ The whole of this appeal to Nemesis ( stanzas cxxx. - cxxxviii . ) must be compared with the “ Domestic Poems ” of 1816 , the Third Canto of Childe Harold ( especially stanzas lxix. - lxxv ., and cxi. - cxviii . ) , and with the “ Invocation ” in the first act of Manfred . It has been argued that Byron inserted these stanzas with the deliberate purpose of diverting sympathy from his wife to himself . The appeal , no doubt , is deliberate , and the plea is followed by an indictment , but the sincerity of the appeal is attested by its inconsistency . Unlike Orestes , who slew his mother to avenge his father , he will not so deal with the “ moral Clytemnestra of her lord , ” requiting murder by murder , but is resolved to leave the balancing of the scale to the omnipotent Time-spirit who rights every wrong and will redress his injuries . But in making answer to his accusers he outruns Nemesis , and himself enacts the part of a “ moral ” Orestes . It was true that his hopes were “ sapped ” and “ his name blighted , ” and it was natural , if not heroic , first to persuade himself that his suffering exceeded his fault , that he was more sinned against than sinning , and , so persuaded , to take care that he should not suffer alone . The general purport of plea and indictment is plain enough , but the exact interpretation of his phrases , the appropriation of his dark sayings , belong rather to the biography of the poet than to a commentary on his poems .

     <p>[ The Pantheon consists of two parts , a porch or pronaos supported by sixteen Corinthian columns , and behind it , but “ obviously disjointed from it , ” a rotunda or round temple , 143 feet high , and 142 feet in diameter . The inscription on the portico ( M. AGRIPPA , L. F. Cos. tertium . Fecit . ) affirms that the temple was built by Agrippa ( M. Vipsanius ) , B. C . 27 .</p>
     <p>It has long been suspected that with regard to the existing building the inscription was “ historically and artistically misleading ; ” but it is only since 1892 that it has been known for certain ( from the stamp on the bricks in various parts of the building ) that the rotunda was built by Hadrian . Difficulties with regard to the relations between the two parts of the Pantheon remain unsolved , but on the following points Professor Lanciani claims to speak with certainty :—</p>
     <p>( 1 ) “ The present Pantheon , portico included , is not the work of Agrippa , but of Hadrian , and dates from A. D. 120-124 .</p>
     <p>( 2 ) “ The columns , capital , and entablature of the portico , inscribed with Agrippa 's name , may be original , and may date from 27-25 B. C ., but they were first removed and then put together by Hadrian .</p>

Honorius ( A. D. 428 ) was probably the first to convert the mausoleum into a fortress . The bronze statue of the Destroying Angel , which is placed on the summit , dates from 1740 , and is the successor to five earlier statues , of which the first was erected in 1453 .

T. Wood , the agent of the Trustees of the British Museum , had so far completed his excavations as to discover the foundations of the building on the exact spot which had been pointed out by Guhl in 1843 . Fragments of the famous sculptured columns , thirty-six in number , says Pliny ( Hist . Nat ., xxxvi . 95 ) , were also brought to light , and are now in the British Museum .

     <note>526 ] [ Pliny tells us ( Hist . Nat ., xxxvi . 5 ) that the Laocoon which stood in the palace of Titus was the work of three sculptors , natives of Rhodes ; and it is now universally admitted that the statue which was found ( January 14 , 1516 ) in the vineyard of Felice de ’ Freddi , not far from the ruins of the palace , and is now in the Vatican , is the statue which Pliny describes . M. Collignon , in his Histoire de la Sculpture Grecque , gives reasons for assigning the date of the Laocoon to the first years of the first century B. C . It follows that the work is a century later than the frieze of the great altar of Pergamos , which contains the figure of a young giant caught in the toils of Athena 's serpent — a theme which served as a model for later sculptors of the same school . In 1817 the Laocoon was in the heyday of its fame , and was regarded as the supreme achievement of ancient art . Since then it has been decried and dethroned . M. Collignon protests against this excessive depreciation , and makes himself the mouthpiece of a second and more temperate reaction : “ On peut ... gôuter mediocrement le mélodrame , sans méconnaître pour cela les réelles qualités du groupe . La composition est d'une structure irréprochable , d'une harmonie de lignes qui défie toute critique . Le torse du Laocoon trahit une science du nu pen commune ” ( Hist . de la Sculp .

     <note>527 ] [ In his description of the Apollo Belvidere , Byron follows the traditional theory of Montorsoli , the pupil of Michael Angelo , who restored the left hand and right forearm of the statue . The god , after his struggle with the python , stands forth proud and disdainful , the left hand holding a bow , and the right hand falling as of one who had just shot an arrow . The discovery , in 1860 , of a bronze statuette in the Stroganoff Collection at St. Petersburg , which holds something like an ægis and a mantle in the left hand , suggested to Stephani a second theory , that the Belvidere Apollo was a copy of a statue of Apollo Boëdromios , an ex-voto offering on the rout of the Gauls when they attacked Delphi ( B. C . 278 ) . To this theory Furtwaengler at one time assented , but subsequently came to the conclusion that the Stroganoff bronze was a forgery . His present contention is that the left hand held a bow , as Montorsoli imagined , whilst the right grasped “ a branch of laurel , of which the leaves are still visible on the trunk which the copyist added to the bronze original . ” The Apollo Belvidere is , he concludes , a copy of the Apollo Alexicacos of Leochares ( fourth century B. C . ) , which stood in the Cerameicos at Athens . M. Maxime Collignon , who utters a word of warning as to the undue depreciation of the statue by modern critics , adopts Furtwaengler 's later theory ( Masterpieces of Ancient Greek Sculpture , by A. Furtwaengler , 1895 , ii . 405 , sq . ) .</note>

     <p>The communication between the ducal palace and the prisons of Venice is by a gloomy bridge , or covered gallery , high above the water , and divided by a stone wall into a passage and a cell . The state dungeons called pozzi , or wells , were sunk in the thick walls of the palace : and the prisoner , when taken out to die , was conducted across the gallery to the other side , and being then led back into the other compartment , or cell , upon the bridge , was there strangled . The low portal through which the criminal was taken into this cell is now walled up ; but the passage is still open , and is still known by the name of the “ Bridge of Sighs . ” The pozzi are under the flooring of the chamber at the foot of the bridge . They were formerly twelve ; but on the first arrival of the French , the Venetians hastily blocked or broke up the deeper of these dungeons . You may still , however descend by a trap-door , and crawl down through holes , half choked by rubbish , to the depth of two stories below the first range . If you are in want of consolation for the extinction of patrician power , perhaps you may find it there ; scarcely a ray of light glimmers into the narrow gallery which leads to the cells , and the places of confinement themselves are totally dark . A small hole in the wall admitted the damp air of the passages , and served for the introduction of the prisoner 's food . A wooden pallet , raised a foot from the ground , was the only furniture . The conductors tell you that a light was not allowed . The cells are about five paces in length , two and a half in width , and seven feet in height . They are directly beneath one another , and respiration is somewhat difficult in the lower holes . Only one prisoner was found when the republicans descended into these hideous recesses , and he is said to have been confined sixteen years . But the inmates of the dungeons beneath had left traces of their repentance , or of their despair , which are still visible , and may , perhaps , owe something to recent ingenuity . Some of the detained appear to have offended against , and others to have belonged to , the sacred body , not only from their signatures , but from the churches and belfries which they have scratched upon the walls . The reader may not object to see a specimen of the records prompted by so terrific a solitude . As nearly as they could be copied by more than one pencil , three of them are as follows :—</p>
     <p>1 . NON TI FIDAR AD ALCUNO PENSA e TACI SE FUGIR VUOI DE SPIONI INSIDIE e LACCI IL PENTIRTI PENTIRTI NULLA GIOVA MA BEN DI VALOR TUO LA VERA PROVA</p>

     <p>3 . DE CHI MI FIDO GUARDAMI DIO DE CHI NON MI FIDO MI GUARDARO IO A TA H A NA V. LA S. C. K. R .</p>
     <p>The copyist has followed , not corrected , the solecisms ; some of which are , however , not quite so decided since the letters were evidently scratched in the dark . It only need be observed , that bestemmia and mangiar may be read in the first inscription , which was probably written by a prisoner confined for some act of impiety committed at a funeral ; that Cortellarius is the name of a parish on terra firma , near the sea ; and that the last initials evidently are put for Viva la santa Chiesa Kattolica Romana .</p>

     <note>“ I cannot forbear mentioning a custom in Venice , which they tell me is particular to the common people of this country , of singing stanzas out of Tasso . They are set to a pretty solemn tune , and when one begins in any part of the poet , it is odds but he will be answered by somebody else that overhears him ; so that sometimes you have ten or a dozen in the neighbourhood of one another , taking verse after verse , and running on with the poem as far as their memories will carry them . ” — Addison , A. D. 1700 .</note>
     <p>The well-known song of the gondoliers , of alternate stanzas from Tasso 's Jerusalem , has died with the independence of Venice . Editions of the poem , with the original in one column , and the Venetian variations on the other , as sung by the boatmen , were once common , and are still to be found .

      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>On the 7th of last January , the author of Childe Harold , and another Englishman , the writer of this notice , rowed to the Lido with two singers , one of whom was a carpenter , and the other a gondolier . The former placed himself at the prow , the latter at the stern of the boat . A little after leaving the quay of the Piazzetta , they began to sing , and continued their exercise until we arrived at the island . They gave us , amongst other essays , the death of Clorinda , and the palace of Armida ; and did not sing the Venetian but the Tuscan verses . The carpenter , however , who was the cleverer of the two , and was frequently obliged to prompt his companion , told us that he could translate the original . He added , that he could sing almost three hundred stanzas , but had not spirits ( morbin was the word he used ) to learn any more , or to sing what he already knew : a man must have idle time on his hands to acquire , or to repeat , and , said the poor fellow , “ look at my clothes and at me ; I am starving . ” This speech was more affecting than his performance , which habit alone can make attractive . The recitative was shrill , screaming , and monotonous ; and the gondolier behind assisted his voice by holding his hand to one side of his mouth . The carpenter used a quiet action , which he evidently endeavoured to restrain ; but was too much interested in his subject altogether to repress . From these men we learnt that singing is not confined to the gondoliers , and that , although the chant is seldom , if ever , voluntary , there are still several amongst the lower classes who are acquainted with a few stanzas .</p>
     <p>It does not appear that it is usual for the performers to row and sing at the same time . Although the verses of the Jerusalem are no longer casually heard , there is yet much music upon the Venetian canals ; and upon holydays , those strangers who are not near or informed enough to distinguish the words , may fancy that many of the gondolas still resound with the strains of Tasso . The writer of some remarks which appeared in the Curiosities of Literature must excuse his being twice quoted ; for , with the exception of some phrases a little too ambitious and extravagant , he has furnished a very exact , as well as agreeable description :—</p>
     <p>“ In Venice the gondoliers know by heart long passages from Ariosto and Tasso , and often chant them with a peculiar melody . But this talent seems at present on the decline :— at least , after taking some pains , I could find no more than two persons who delivered to me in this way a passage from Tasso . I must add , that the late Mr. Berry once chanted to me a passage in Tasso in the manner , as he assured me , of the gondoliers .</p>
     <p>“ There are always two concerned , who alternately sing the strophes . We know the melody eventually by Rousseau , to whose songs it is printed ; it has properly no melodious movement , and is a sort of medium between the canto fermo and the canto figurato ; it approaches to the former by recitativical declamation , and to the latter by passages and course , by which one syllable is detained and embellished .</p>
     <p>“ I entered a gondola by moonlight ; one singer placed himself forwards and the other aft , and thus proceeded to St. Georgio . One began the song : when he had ended his strophe , the other took up the lay , and so continued the song alternately . Throughout the whole of it , the same notes invariably returned ; but , according to the subject-matter of the strophe , they laid a greater or a smaller stress , sometimes on one , and sometimes on another note , and indeed changed the enunciation of the whole strophe as the object of the poem altered .</p>
     <p>“ On the whole , however , the sounds were hoarse and screaming : they seemed , in the manner of all rude uncivilised men , to make the excellency of their singing in the force of their voice . One seemed desirous of conquering the other by the strength of his lungs ; and so far from receiving delight from this scene ( shut up as I was in the box of the gondola ) , I found myself in a very unpleasant situation .</p>
     <p>“ My companion , to whom I communicated this circumstance , being very desirous to keep up the credit of his countrymen , assured me that the singing was very delightful when heard at a distance . Accordingly we got out upon the shore , leaving one of the singers in the gondola , while the other went to the distance of some hundred paces . They now began to sing against one another , and I kept walking up and down between them both , so as always to leave him who was to begin his part . I frequently stood still and hearkened to the one and to the other .</p>
     <p>“ Here the scene was properly introduced . The strong declamatory , and , as it were , shrieking sound , met the ear from far , and called forth the attention ; the quickly succeeding transitions , which necessarily required to be sung in a lower tone , seemed like plaintive strains succeeding the vociferations of emotion or of pain . The other , who listened attentively , immediately began where the former left off , answering him in milder or more vehement notes , according as the purport of the strophe required . The sleepy canals , the lofty buildings , the splendour of the moon , the deep shadows of the few gondolas that moved like spirits hither and thither , increased the striking peculiarity of the scene ; and , amidst all these circumstances , it was easy to confess the character of this wonderful harmony .</p>
     <p>“ It suits perfectly well with an idle , solitary mariner , lying at length in his vessel at rest on one of these canals , waiting for his company , or for a fare , the tiresomeness of which situation is somewhat alleviated by the songs and poetical stories he has in memory . He often raises his voice as loud as he can , which extends itself to a vast distance over the tranquil mirror ; and as all is still around , he is , as it were , in a solitude in the midst of a large and populous town . Here is no rattling of carriages , no noise of foot passengers ; a silent gondola glides now and then by him , of which the splashings of the oars are scarcely to be heard .</p>
     <p>“ At a distance he hears another , perhaps utterly unknown to him . Melody and verse immediately attach the two strangers ; he becomes the responsive echo to the former , and exerts himself to be heard as he had heard the other . By a tacit convention they alternate verse for verse ; though the song should last the whole night through , they entertain themselves without fatigue : the hearers who are passing between the two take part in the amusement .</p>
     <p>“ This vocal performance sounds best at a great distance , and is then inexpressibly charming , as it only fulfills its design in the sentiment of remoteness . It is plaintive , but not dismal in its sound , and at times it is scarcely possible to refrain from tears . My companion , who otherwise was not a very delicately organised person , said quite unexpectedly : E singolare come quel canto intenerisce , e molto più quando lo cantano meglio .</p>
     <p>“ I was told that the women of Libo , the long row of islands that divides the Adriatic from the Lagoons ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 555 ]</span>particularly the women of the extreme districts of Malamocca and Palestrina , sing in like manner the works of Tasso to these and similar tunes .</p>
     <p>“ They have the custom , when their husbands are fishing out at sea , to sit along the shore in the evenings and vociferate these songs , and continue to do so with great violence , till each of them can distinguish the responses of her own husband at a distance . "[ 556 ]</p>
     <p>The love of music and of poetry distinguishes all classes of Venetians , even amongst the tuneful sons of Italy . The city itself can occasionally furnish respectable audiences for two and even three opera-houses at a time ; and there are few events in private life that do not call forth a printed and circulated sonnet . Does a physician or a lawyer take his degree , or a clergyman preach his maiden sermon , has a surgeon performed an operation , would a harlequin announce his departure or his benefit , are you to be congratulated on a marriage , or a birth , or a lawsuit , the Muses are invoked to furnish the same number of syllables , and the individual triumphs blaze abroad in virgin white or party-coloured placards on half the corners of the capital . The last curtsy of a favourite “ prima donna ” brings down a shower of these poetical tributes from those upper regions , from which , in our theatres , nothing but cupids and snowstorms are accustomed to descend . There is a poetry in the very life of a Venetian , which , in its common course , is varied with those surprises and changes so recommendable in fiction , but so different from the sober monotony of northern existence ; amusements are raised into duties , duties are softened into amusements , and every object being considered as equally making a part of the business of life , is announced and performed with the same earnest indifference and gay assiduity . The Venetian gazette constantly closes its columns with the following triple advertisement :—</p>
     <p>Charade .</p>
     <p>Exposition of the most Holy Sacrament in the church of St .——</p>
     <p>Theatres .</p>

     </lg>
     <p>When it is recollected what the Catholics believe their consecrated wafer to be , we may perhaps think it worthy of a more respectable niche than between poetry and the playhouse .</p>

D. 1815 ] to the ill-chosen spot whence they set out , and are , as before , half hidden under the porch window of St. Mark 's Church . Their history , after a desperate struggle , has been satisfactorily explored . The decisions and doubts of Erizzo and Zanetti , and lastly , of the Count Leopold Cicognara , would have given them a Roman extraction , and a pedigree not more ancient than the reign of Nero . But M. de Schlegel stepped in to teach the Venetians the value of their own treasures ; and a Greek vindicated , at last and for ever , the pretension of his countrymen to this noble production<span type="note_anchor">[ 557 ]</span>. M. Mustoxidi has not been left without a reply ; but , as yet , he has received no answer . It should seem that the horses are irrevocably Chian , and were transferred to Constantinople by Theodosius . Lapidary writing is a favourite play of the Italians , and has conferred reputation on more than one of their literary characters . One of the best specimens of Bodoni 's typography is a respectable volume of inscriptions , all written by his friend Pacciaudi . Several were prepared for the recovered horses . It is to be hoped the best was not selected , when the following words were ranged in gold letters above the cathedral porch :—</p>
     <p>QUATUOR . EQUORUM . SIGNA . A. VENETIS . BYZANTIO . CAPTA . AD . TEMP . D. MAR . A. R. S. MCCIV . POSITA . QUAE . HOSTILIS . CUPIDITAS . A. MDCCIIIC . ABSTULERAT . FRANC . I. IMP . PACIS . ORBI . DATAE . TROPHAEUM . A. MDCCCXV . VICTOR . REDUXIT .</p>
     <p>Nothing shall be said of the Latin , but it may be permitted to observe , that the injustice of the Venetians in transporting the horses from Constantinople [ A. D. 1204 ] was at least equal to that of the French in carrying them to Paris [ A. D. 1797 ] , and that it would have been more prudent to have avoided all allusions to either robbery . An apostolic prince should , perhaps , have objected to affixing over the principal entrance of a metropolitan church an inscription having a reference to any other triumphs than those of religion . Nothing less than the pacification of the world can excuse such a solecism .</p>

     <p>After many vain efforts on the part of the Italians entirely to throw off the yoke of Frederic Barbarossa , and as fruitless attempts of the Emperor to make himself absolute master throughout the whole of his Cisalpine dominions , the bloody struggles of four-and-twenty years were happily brought to a close in the city of Venice . The articles of a treaty had been previously agreed upon between Pope Alexander III . and Barbarossa ; and the former having received a safe-conduct , had already arrived at Venice from Ferrara , in company with the ambassadors of the King of Sicily and the consuls of the Lombard League . There still remained , however , many points to adjust , and for several days the peace was believed to be impracticable . At this juncture , it was suddenly reported that the Emperor had arrived at Chioza , a town fifteen miles from the capital . The Venetians rose tumultuously , and insisted upon immediately conducting him to the city . The Lombards took the alarm , and departed towards Treviso . The Pope himself was apprehensive of some disaster if Frederic should suddenly advance upon him , but was reassured by the prudence and address of Sebastian Ziani , the Doge . Several embassies passed between Chioza and the capital , until , at last , the Emperor , relaxing somewhat of his pretensions , “ laid aside his leonine ferocity , and put on the mildness of the lamb . "[ 558 ]</p>
     <p>On Saturday , the 23rd of July , in the year 1177 , six Venetian galleys transferred Frederic , in great pomp , from Chioza to the island of Lido , a mile from Venice . Early the next morning , the Pope , accompanied by the Sicilian ambassadors , and by the envoys of Lombardy , whom he had recalled from the main land , together with a great concourse of people , repaired from the patriarchal palace to St. Mark 's Church , and solemnly absolved the Emperor and his partisans from the excommunication pronounced against him . The Chancellor of the Empire , on the part of his master , renounced the anti-popes and their schismatic adherents . Immediately the Doge , with a great suite both of the clergy and laity , got on board the galleys , and waiting on Frederic , rowed him in mighty state from the Lido to the capital . The Emperor descended from the galley at the quay of the Piazzetta . The Doge , the patriarch , his bishops and clergy , and the people of Venice with their crosses and their standards , marched in solemn procession before him to the church of St. Mark . Alexander was seated before the vestibule of the basilica , attended by his bishops and cardinals , by the patriarch of Aquileja , by the archbishops and bishops of Lombardy , all of them in state , and clothed in their church robes . Frederic approached — “ moved by the Holy Spirit , venerating the Almighty in the person of Alexander , laying aside his imperial dignity , and throwing off his mantle , he prostrated himself at full length at the feet of the Pope . Alexander , with tears in his eyes , raised him benignantly from the ground , kissed him , blessed him ; and immediately the Germans of the train sang with a loud voice , ‘ We praise thee , O Lord . ’ The Emperor then taking the Pope by the right hand , led him to the church , and having received his benediction , returned to the ducal palace . "[ 559 ] The ceremony of humiliation was repeated the next day . The Pope himself , at the request of Frederic , said mass at St. Mark 's . The Emperor again laid aside his imperial mantle , and taking a wand in his hand , officiated as verger , driving the laity from the choir , and preceding the pontiff to the altar . Alexander , after reciting the gospel , preached to the people . The Emperor put himself close to the pulpit in the attitude of listening ; and the pontiff , touched by this mark of his attention ( for he knew that Frederic did not understand a word he said ) , commanded the patriarch of Aquileja to translate the Latin discourse into the German tongue . The creed was then chanted . Frederic made his oblation , and kissed the Pope 's feet , and , mass being over , led him by the hand to his white horse . He held the stirrup , and would have led the horse 's rein to the water side , had not the Pope accepted of the inclination for the performance , and affectionately dismissed him with his benediction . Such is the substance of the account left by the archbishop of Salerno , who was present at the ceremony , and whose story is confirmed by every subsequent narration . It would be not worth so minute a record , were it not the triumph of liberty as well as of superstition . The states of Lombardy owed to it the confirmation of their privileges ; and Alexander had reason to thank the Almighty , who had enabled an infirm , unarmed old man to subdue a terrible and potent sovereign .<span type="note_anchor">[ 560 ]</span></p>

     <p>The reader will recollect the exclamation of the Highlander , “ Oh , for one hour of Dundee ! ” Henry Dandolo , when elected Doge , in 1192 , was eighty-five years of age . When he commanded the Venetians at the taking of Constantinople , he was consequently ninety-seven years old . At this age he annexed the fourth and a half of the whole empire of Romania ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 561 ]</span>for so the Roman empire was then called , to the title and to the territories of the Venetian Doge . The three-eighths of this empire were preserved in the diplomas until the Dukedom of Giovanni Dolfino , who made use of the above designation in the year 1357 .<span type="note_anchor">[ 562 ]</span></p>
     <p>Dandolo led the attack on Constantinople in person . Two ships , the Paradise and the Pilgrim , were tied together , and a drawbridge or ladder let down from their higher yards to the walls . The Doge was one of the first to rush into the city . Then was completed , said the Venetians , the prophecy of the Erythræan sibyl :— “ A gathering together of the powerful shall be made amidst the waves of the Adriatic , under a blind leader ; they shall beset the goat — they shall profane Byzantium — they shall blacken her buildings — her spoils shall be dispersed ; a new goat shall bleat until they have measured out and run over fifty-four feet nine inches and a half . "[ 563 ] Dandolo died on the first day of June , 1205 , having reigned thirteen years six months and five days , and was buried in the church of St. Sophia , at Constantinople . Strangely enough it must sound , that the name of the rebel apothecary who received the Doge 's sword , and annihilated the ancient government , in 1796-7 , was Dandolo .</p>

     <p>But is not Doria 's menace come to pass ? Are they not bridled ? Stanza xiii . lines 3 and 4 .</p>
     <p>After the loss of the battle of Pola , and the taking of Chioza on the 16th of August , 1379 , by the united armament of the Genoese and Francesco da Carrara , Signor of Padua , the Venetians were reduced to the utmost despair . An embassy was sent to the conquerors with a blank sheet of paper , praying them to prescribe what terms they pleased , and leave to Venice only her independence . The Prince of Padua was inclined to listen to these proposals ; but the Genoese , who , after the victory at Pola , had shouted , “ To Venice ! to Venice ! and long live St. George ! ” determined to annihilate their rival ; and Peter Doria , their commander-in-chief , returned this answer to the suppliants : “ On God 's faith , gentlemen of Venice , ye shall have no peace from the Signer of Padua , nor from our commune of Genoa , until we have first put a rein upon those unbridled horses of yours , that are upon the porch of your evangelist St. Mark . When we have bridled them we shall keep you quiet . And this is the pleasure of us and of our commune . As for these , my brothers of Genoa , that you have brought with you to give up to us , I will not have them : take them back ; for in a few days hence , I shall come and let them out of prison myself , both these and all the others ” [ p. 727 , E. vide infra ] . In fact , the Genoese did advance as far as Malamocco , within five miles of the capital ; but their own danger , and the pride of their enemies , gave courage to the Venetians , who made prodigious efforts , and many individual sacrifices , all of them carefully recorded by their historians . Vettor Pisani was put at the head of thirty-four galleys . The Genoese broke up from Malamocco , and retired to Chioza in October ; but they again threatened Venice , which was reduced to extremities . At this time , the 1st of January , 1380 , arrived Carlo Zeno , who had been cruising on the Genoese coast with fourteen galleys . The Venetians were now strong enough to besiege the Genoese . Doria was killed on the 22nd of January , by a stone bullet , one hundred and ninety-five pounds ’ weight , discharged from a bombard called the Trevisan . Chioza was then closely invested ; five thousand auxiliaries , among whom were some English condottieri , commanded by one Captain Ceccho , joined the Venetians . The Genoese , in their turn , prayed for conditions , but none were granted , until , at last , they surrendered at discretion ; and , on the 24th of June , 1380 , the Doge Contarini made his triumphal entry into Chioza . Four thousand prisoners , nineteen galleys , many smaller vessels and barks , with all the ammunition and arms , and outfit of the expedition , fell into the hands of the conquerors , who , had it not been for the inexorable answer of Doria , would have gladly reduced their dominion to the city of Venice . An account of these transactions is found in a work called The War of Chioza ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 564 ]</span>written by Daniel Chinazzo , who was in Venice at the time .</p>

     <p>The population of Venice , at the end of the seventeenth century , amounted to nearly two hundred thousand souls . At the last census , taken two years ago<span type="note_anchor">[ 1816 ]</span>, it was no more than about one hundred and three thousand ; and it diminishes daily . The commerce and the official employments , which were to be the unexhausted source of Venetian grandeur , have both expired .<span type="note_anchor">[ 565 ]</span>Most of the patrician mansions are deserted , and would gradually disappear , had not the Government , alarmed by the demolition of seventy-two during the last two years , expressly forbidden this sad resource of poverty . Many remnants of the Venetian nobility are now scattered , and confounded with the wealthier Jews upon the banks of the Brenta , whose Palladian palaces have sunk , or are sinking , in the general decay . Of the “ gentiluomo Veneto , ” the name is still known , and that is all . He is but the shadow of his former self , but he is polite and kind . It surely may be pardoned to him if he is querulous . Whatever may have been the vices of the republic , and although the natural term of its existence may be thought by foreigners to have arrived in the due course of mortality , only one sentiment can be expected from the Venetians themselves . At no time were the subjects of the republic so unanimous in their resolution to rally round the standard of St. Mark , as when it was for the last time unfurled ; and the cowardice and the treachery of the few patricians who recommended the fatal neutrality , were confined to the persons of the traitors themselves . The present race cannot be thought to regret the loss of their aristocratical forms , and too despotic government ; they think only on their vanished independence . They pine away at the remembrance , and on this subject suspend for a moment their gay good humour . Venice may be said , in the words of the Scripture , “ to die daily ; ” and so general and so apparent is the decline , as to become painful to a stranger , not reconciled to the sight of a whole nation expiring , as it were , before his eyes . So artificial a creation , having lost that principle which called it into life and supported its existence , must fall to pieces at once , and sink more rapidly than it rose . The abhorrence of slavery , which drove the Venetians to the sea , has , since their disaster , forced them to the land , where they may be at least overlooked amongst the crowd of dependents , and not present the humiliating spectacle of a whole nation loaded with recent chains . Their liveliness , their affability , and that happy indifference which constitution alone can give ( for philosophy aspires to it in vain ) , have not sunk under circumstances ; but many peculiarities of costume and manner have by degrees been lost ; and the nobles , with a pride common to all Italians who have been masters , have not been persuaded to parade their insignificance . That splendour which was a proof and a portion of their power , they would not degrade into the trappings of their subjection . They retired from the space which they had occupied in the eyes of their fellow citizens ; their continuance in which would have been a symptom of acquiescence , and an insult to those who suffered by the common misfortune . Those who remained in the degraded capital , might be said rather to haunt the scenes of their departed power , than to live in them . The reflection , “ who and what enthrals , ” will hardly bear a comment from one who is , nationally , the friend and the ally of the conqueror . It may , however , be allowed to say thus much , that to those who wish to recover their independence , any masters must be an object of detestation ; and it may be safely foretold that this unprofitable aversion will not have been corrected before Venice shall have sunk into the slime of her choked canals .</p>

     <p>Thanks to the critical acumen of a Scotchman , we now know as little of Laura as ever .<span type="note_anchor">[ 566 ]</span>The discoveries of the Abbé de Sade , his triumphs , his sneers , can no longer instruct or amuse . We must not , however , think that these memoirs<span type="note_anchor">[ 567 ]</span>are as much a romance as Belisarius or the Incas , although we are told so by Dr. Beattie , a great name , but a little authority .<span type="note_anchor">[ 568 ]</span>His “ labour ” has not been in vain , notwithstanding his “ love ” has , like most other passions , made him ridiculous .<span type="note_anchor">[ 569 ]</span>The hypothesis which overpowered the struggling Italians , and carried along less interested critics in its current , is run out . We have another proof that we can never be sure that the paradox , the most singular , and therefore having the most agreeable and authentic air , will not give place to the re-established ancient prejudice .</p>
     <p>It seems , then , first , that Laura was born , lived , died , and was buried , not in Avignon , but in the country . The fountains of the Sorga , the thickets of Cabrieres , may resume their pretensions , and the exploded de la Bastie again be heard with complacency . The hypothesis of the Abbé had no stronger props than the parchment sonnet and medal found on the skeleton of the wife of Hugo de Sade , and the manuscript note to the Virgil of Petrarch , now in the Ambrosian library . If these proofs were both incontestable , the poetry was written , the medal composed , cast , and deposited within the space of twelve hours : and these deliberate duties were performed round the carcass of one who died of the plague , and was hurried to the grave on the day of her death . These documents , therefore , are too decisive : they prove not the fact , but the forgery . Either the sonnet or the Virgilian note must be a falsification . The Abbé cites both as incontestably true ; the consequent deduction is inevitable — they are both evidently false .<span type="note_anchor">[ 570 ]</span></p>
     <p>Secondly , Laura was never married , and was a haughty virgin rather than that tender and prudent wife who honoured Avignon , by making that town the theatre of an honest French passion , and played off for one and twenty years her little machinery of alternate favours and refusals<span type="note_anchor">[ 571 ]</span>upon the first poet of the age . It was , indeed , rather too unfair that a female should be made responsible for eleven children upon the faith of a misinterpreted abbreviation , and the decision of a librarian .<span type="note_anchor">[ 572 ]</span>It is , however , satisfactory to think that the love of Petrarch was not platonic . The happiness which he prayed to possess but once and for a moment was surely not of the mind ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 573 ]</span>and something so very real as a marriage project , with one who has been idly called a shadowy nymph , may be , perhaps , detected in at least six places of his own sonnets . The love of Petrarch was neither platonic nor poetical ; and if in one passage of his works he calls it “ amore veementeissimo ma unico ed onesto , ” he confesses , in a letter to a friend , that it was guilty and perverse , that it absorbed him quite , and mastered his heart .</p>
     <p>In this case , however , he was perhaps alarmed for the culpability of his wishes ; for the Abbé de Sade himself , who certainly would not have been scrupulously delicate if he could have proved his descent from Petrarch as well as Laura , is forced into a stout defence of his virtuous grandmother . As far as relates to the poet , we have no security for the innocence , except perhaps in the constancy of his pursuit . He assures us in his epistle to posterity , that , when arrived at his fortieth year , he not only had in horror , but had lost all recollection and image of any “ irregularity . ” But the birth of his natural daughter cannot be assigned earlier than his thirty-ninth year ; and either the memory or the morality of the poet must have failed him , when he forgot or was guilty of this slip .<span type="note_anchor">[ 574 ]</span>The weakest argument for the purity of this love has been drawn from the permanence of its effects , which survived the object of his passion . The reflection of M. de la Bastie , that virtue alone is capable of making impressions which death cannot efface , is one of those which everybody applauds , and everybody finds not to be true , the moment he examines his own breast or the records of human feeling .<span type="note_anchor">[ 575 ]</span>Such apophthegms can do nothing for Petrarch or for the cause of morality , except with the very weak and the very young . He that has made even a little progress beyond ignorance and pupilage cannot be edified with anything but truth . What is called vindicating the honour of an individual or a nation , is the most futile , tedious , and uninstructive of all writing ; although it will always meet with more applause than that sober criticism , which is attributed to the malicious desire of reducing a great man to the common standard of humanity . It is , after all , not unlikely that our historian was right in retaining his favourite hypothetic salvo , which secures the author , although it scarcely saves the honour of the still unknown mistress of Petrarch .<span type="note_anchor">[ 576 ]</span></p>

       <l n="1">They keep his dust in Arqua , where he died .</l>
       <l n="2">Stanza xxxi . line 1 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Petrarch retired to Arquà immediately on his return from the unsuccessful attempt to visit Urban V. at Rome , in the year 1370 , and with the exception of his celebrated visit to Venice in company with Francesco Novello da Carrara , he appears to have passed the four last years of his life between that charming solitude and Padua . For four months previous to his death he was in a state of continual languor , and in the morning of July the 19th , in the year 1374 , was found dead in his library chair with his head resting upon a book . The chair is still shown amongst the precious relics of Arquà , which , from the uninterrupted veneration that has been attached to everything relative to this great man from the moment of his death to the present hour , have , it may be hoped , a better chance of authenticity than the Shaksperian memorials of Stratford-upon-Avon .</p>
     <p>Arquà ( for the last syllable is accented in pronunciation , although the analogy of the English language has been observed in the verse ) is twelve miles from Padua , and about three miles on the right of the high road to Rovigo , in the bosom of the Euganean hills . After a walk of twenty minutes across a flat well-wooded meadow , you come to a little blue lake , clear but fathomless , and to the foot of a succession of acclivities and hills , clothed with vineyards and orchards , rich with fir and pomegranate trees , and every sunny fruit shrub . From the banks of the lake the road winds into the hills , and the church of Arquà is soon seen between a cleft where two ridges slope towards each other , and nearly enclose the village . The houses are scattered at intervals on the steep sides of these summits ; and that of the poet is on the edge of a little knoll overlooking two descents , and commanding a view , not only of the glowing gardens in the dales immediately beneath , but of the wide plains , above whose low woods of mulberry and willow , thickened into a dark mass by festoons of vines , tall , single cypresses , and the spires of towns , are seen in the distance , which stretches to the mouths of the Po and the shores of the Adriatic . The climate of these volcanic hills is warmer , and the vintage begins a week sooner than in the plains of Padua . Petrarch is laid , for he cannot be said to be buried , in a sarcophagus of red marble , raised on four pilasters on an elevated base , and preserved from an association with meaner tombs . It stands conspicuously alone , but will be soon overshadowed by four lately planted laurels . Petrarch 's Fountain , for here everything is Petrarch 's , springs and expands itself beneath an artificial arch , a little below the church , and abounds plentifully , in the driest season , with that soft water which was the ancient wealth of the Euganean hills . It would be more attractive , were it not , in some seasons , beset with hornets and wasps . No other coincidence could assimilate the tombs of Petrarch and Archilochus . The revolutions of centuries have spared these sequestered valleys , and the only violence which has been offered to the ashes of Petrarch was prompted , not by hate , but veneration . An attempt was made to rob the sarcophagus of its treasure , and one of the arms was stolen by a Florentine through a rent which is still visible . The injury is not forgotten , but has served to identify the poet with the country where he was born , but where he would not live . A peasant boy of Arquà being asked who Petrarch was , replied , “ that the people of the parsonage knew all about him , but that he only knew that he was a Florentine . ”</p>
     <p>Mr. Forsyth<span type="note_anchor">[ 577 ]</span>was not quite correct in saying that Petrarch never returned to Tuscany after he had once quitted it when a boy . It appears he did pass through Florence on his way from Parma to Rome , and on his return in the year 1350 , and remained there long enough to form some acquaintance with its most distinguished inhabitants . A Florentine gentleman , ashamed of the aversion of the poet for his native country , was eager to point out this trivial error in our accomplished traveller , whom he knew and respected for an extraordinary capacity , extensive erudition , and refined taste , joined to that engaging simplicity of manners which has been so frequently recognised as the surest , though it is certainly not an indispensable , trait of superior genius .</p>
     <p>Every footstep of Laura 's lover has been anxiously traced and recorded . The house in which he lodged is shown in Venice . The inhabitants of Arezzo , in order to decide the ancient controversy between their city and the neighbouring Ancisa , where Petrarch was carried when seven months old , and remained until his seventh year , have designated by a long inscription the spot where their great fellow citizen was born . A tablet has been raised to him at Parma , in the chapel of St. Agatha , at the cathedral , because he was arch-deacon of that society , and was only snatched from his intended sepulture in their church by a foreign death . Another tablet , with a bust , has been erected to him at Pavia , on account of his having passed the autumn of 1368 in that city , with his son-in-law Brossano . The political condition which has for ages precluded the Italians from the criticism of the living , has concentrated their attention to the illustration of the dead .</p>

     <p>The biographer Serassi ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 578 ]</span>out of tenderness to the reputation either of the Italian or the French poet , is eager to observe that the satirist recanted or explained away this censure , and subsequently allowed the author of the Jerusalem to be “ a genius sublime , vast , and happily born for the higher flights of poetry . ” To this we will add , that the recantation is far from satisfactory , when we examine the whole anecdote as reported by Olivet .<span type="note_anchor">[ 579 ]</span>The sentence pronounced against him by Bouhours<span type="note_anchor">[ 580 ]</span>is recorded only to the confusion of the critic , whose palinodia the Italian makes no effort to discover , and would not , perhaps , accept . As to the opposition which the Jerusalem encountered from the Cruscan academy , who degraded Tasso from all competition with Ariosto , below Bojardo and Pulci , the disgrace of such opposition must also in some measure be laid to the charge of Alfonso , and the court of Ferrara . For Leonard Salviati , the principal and nearly the sole origin of this attack , was , there can be no doubt ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 581 ]</span>influenced by a hope to acquire the favour of the House of Este : an object which he thought attainable by exalting the reputation of a native poet at the expense of a rival , then a prisoner of state . The hopes and efforts of Salviati must serve to show the contemporary opinion as to the nature of the poet 's imprisonment ; and will fill up the measure of our indignation at the tyrant jailer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 582 ]</span>In fact , the antagonist of Tasso was not disappointed in the reception given to his criticism ; he was called to the court of Ferrara , where , having endeavoured to heighten his claims to favour , by panegyrics on the family of his sovereign ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 583 ]</span>he was in turn abandoned , and expired in neglected poverty . The opposition of the Cruscans was brought to a close in six years after the commencement of the controversy ; and if the Academy owed its first renown to having almost opened with such a paradox ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 584 ]</span>it is probable that , on the other hand , the care of his reputation alleviated rather than aggravated the imprisonment of the injured poet . The defence of his father and of himself , for both were involved in the censure of Salviati , found employment for many of his solitary hours , and the captive could have been but little embarrassed to reply to accusations , where , among other delinquencies , he was charged with invidiously omitting , in his comparison between France and Italy , to make any mention of the cupola of St. Maria del Fiore at Florence .<span type="note_anchor">[ 585 ]</span>The late biographer of Ariosto seems as if willing to renew the controversy by doubting the interpretation of Tasso 's self-estimation<span type="note_anchor">[ 586 ]</span>related in Serassi 's life of the poet . But Tiraboschi had before laid that rivalry at rest ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 587 ]</span>by showing that between Ariosto and Tasso it is not a question of comparison , but of preference .</p>

     <p>Before the remains of Ariosto were removed from the Benedictine church to the library of Ferrara , his bust , which surmounted the tomb , was struck by lightning , and a crown of iron laurels melted away .

     <p>The eagle , the sea calf , the laurel , and the white vine ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 591 ]</span>were amongst the most approved preservatives against lightning : Jupiter chose the first , Augustus Cæsar the second , and Tiberius never failed to wear a wreath of the third when the sky threatened a thunder-storm .<span type="note_anchor">[ 592 ]</span>These superstitions may be received without a sneer in a country where the magical properties of the hazel twig have not lost all their credit ; and perhaps the reader may not be much surprised that a commentator on Suetonius has taken upon himself gravely to disprove the imputed virtues of the crown of Tiberius , by mentioning that a few years before he wrote a laurel was actually struck by lightning at Rome .<span type="note_anchor">[ 593 ]</span></p>

     <p>The Curtian lake and the Ruminal fig-tree in the Forum , having been touched by lightning , were held sacred , and the memory of the accident was preserved by a pateal , or altar resembling the mouth of a well , with a little chapel covering the cavity supposed to be made by the thunder-bolt .

     <p>Those killed by lightning were wrapped in a white garment , and buried where they fell . The superstition was not confined to the worshippers of Jupiter : the Lombards believed in the omens furnished by lightning ; and a Christian priest confesses that , by a diabolical skill in interpreting thunder , a seer foretold to Agilulf , duke of Turin , an event which came to pass , and gave him a queen and a crown .<span type="note_anchor">[ 596 ]</span>There was , however , something equivocal in this sign , which the ancient inhabitants of Rome did not always consider propitious ; and as the fears are likely to last longer than the consolations of superstition , it is not strange that the Romans of the age of Leo X. should have been so much terrified at some misinterpreted storms as to require the exhortations of a scholar , who arrayed all the learning on thunder and lightning to prove the omen favourable ; beginning with the flash which struck the walls of Velitræ ;, and including that which played upon a gate at Florence , and foretold the pontificate of one of its citizens .<span type="note_anchor">[ 597 ]</span></p>

The same conclusion may be deduced from another hint in the same episode of Musidora ; for Thomson 's notion of the privileges of favoured love must have been either very primitive , or rather deficient in delicacy , when he made his grateful nymph inform her discreet Damon that in some happier moment he might perhaps be the companion of her bath :—</p>

     <p>The reader will recollect the anecdote told in the Life of Dr. Johnson . We will not leave the Florentine gallery without a word on the Whetter . It seems strange that the character of that disputed statue should not be entirely decided , at least in the mind of any one who has seen a sarcophagus in the vestibule of the Basilica of St. Paul without the walls , at Rome , where the whole group of the fable of Marsyas is seen in tolerable preservation ; and the Scythian slave whetting the knife , is represented exactly in the same position as this celebrated masterpiece . The slave is not naked ; but it is easier to get rid of this difficulty than to suppose the knife in the hand of the Florentine statue an instrument for shaving , which it must be , if , as Lanzi supposes , the man is no other than the barber of Julius Cæsar . Winckelmann , illustrating a bas-relief of the same subject , follows the opinion of Leonard Agostini , and his authority might have been thought conclusive , even if the resemblance did not strike the most careless observer .<span type="note_anchor">[ 598 ]</span>Amongst the bronzes of the same princely collection , is still to be seen the inscribed tablet copied and commented upon by Mr. Gibbon .<span type="note_anchor">[ 599 ]</span>Our historian found some difficulties , but did not desist from his illustration .

     <p>This name will recall the memory , not only of those whose tombs have raised the Santa Croce into the centre of pilgrimage — the Mecca of Italy — but of her whose eloquence was poured over the illustrious ashes , and whose voice is now as mute as those she sung . Corinna is no more ; and with her should expire the fear , the flattery , and the envy , which threw too dazzling or too dark a cloud round the march of genius , and forbad the steady gaze of disinterested criticism . We have her picture embellished or distorted , as friendship or detraction has held the pencil : the impartial portrait was hardly to be expected from a contemporary . The immediate voice of her survivors will , it is probable , be far from affording a just estimate of her singular capacity . The gallantry , the love of wonder , and the hope of associated fame , which blunted the edge of censure , must cease to exist .— The dead have no sex ; they can surprise by no new miracles ; they can confer no privilege : Corinna has ceased to be a woman — she is only an author ; and it may be foreseen that many will repay themselves for former complaisance , by a severity to which the extravagance of previous praises may perhaps give the colour of truth . The latest posterity — for to the latest posterity they will assuredly descend — will have to pronounce upon her various productions ; and the longer the vista through which they are seen , the more accurately minute will be the object , the more certain the justice , of the decision . She will enter into that existence in which the great writers of all ages and nations are , as it were , associated in a world of their own , and , from that superior sphere , shed their eternal influence for the control and consolation of mankind . But the individual will gradually disappear as the author is more distinctly seen ; some one , therefore , of all those whom the charms of involuntary wit , and of easy hospitality , attracted within the friendly circles of Coppet , should rescue from oblivion those virtues which , although they are said to love the shade , are , in fact , more frequently chilled than excited by the domestic cares of private life . Some one should be found to portray the unaffected graces with which she adorned those dearer relationships , the performance of whose duties is rather discovered amongst the interior secrets , than seen in the outward management , of family intercourse ; and which , indeed , it requires the delicacy of genuine affection to qualify for the eye of an indifferent spectator . Some one should be found , not to celebrate , but to describe , the amiable mistress of an open mansion , the centre of a society , ever varied , and always pleased , the creator of which , divested of the ambition and the arts of public rivalry , shone forth only to give fresh animation to those around her . The mother tenderly affectionate and tenderly beloved , the friend unboundedly generous , but still esteemed , the charitable patroness of all distress , cannot be forgotten by those whom she cherished , and protected , and fed . Her loss will be mourned the most where she was known the best ; and , to the sorrows of very many friends , and more dependants , may be offered the disinterested regret of a stranger , who , amidst the sublimer scenes of the Leman lake , received his chief satisfaction from contemplating the engaging qualities of the incomparable Corinna .</p>

     <p>Alfieri is the great name of this age . The Italians , without waiting for the hundred years , consider him as “ a poet good in law . ” — His memory is the more dear to them because he is the bard of freedom ; and because , as such , his tragedies can receive no countenance from any of their sovereigns . They are but very seldom , and but very few of them , allowed to be acted . It was observed by Cicero , that nowhere were the true opinions and feelings of the Romans so clearly shown as at the theatre .<span type="note_anchor">[ 600 ]</span>In the autumn of 1816 , a celebrated improvisatore exhibited his talents at the Opera-house of Milan . The reading of the theses handed in for the subjects of his poetry was received by a very numerous audience , for the most part in silence , or with laughter ; but when the assistant , unfolding one of the papers , exclaimed The apotheosis of Victor Alfieri , the whole theatre burst into a shout , and the applause was continued for some moments . The lot did not fall on Alfieri ; and the Signor Sgricci had to pour forth his extemporary common-places on the bombardment of Algiers . The choice , indeed , is not left to accident quite so much as might be thought from a first view of the ceremony ; and the police not only takes care to look at the papers beforehand , but , in case of any prudential afterthought , steps in to correct the blindness of chance . The proposal for deifying Alfieri was received with immediate enthusiasm , the rather because it was conjectured there would be no opportunity of carrying it into effect .</p>

     <p>The affectation of simplicity in sepulchral inscriptions , which so often leaves us uncertain whether the structure before us is an actual depository , or a cenotaph , or a simple memorial not of death but life , has given to the tomb of Machiavelli no information as to the place or time of the birth or death , the age or parentage , of the historian .</p>
     <p>TANTO NOMINI NVLLVM PAR ELOGIVM NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI .</p>
     <p>There seems at least no reason why the name should not have been put above the sentence which alludes to it .</p>
     <p>It will readily be imagined that the prejudices which have passed the name of Machiavelli into an epithet proverbial of iniquity exist no longer at Florence . His memory was persecuted , as his life had been , for an attachment to liberty incompatible with the new system of despotism , which succeeded the fall of the free governments of Italy . He was put to the torture for being a “ libertine , ” that is , for wishing to restore the republic of Florence ; and such are the undying efforts of those who are interested in the perversion , not only of the nature of actions , but the meaning of words , that what was once patriotism , has by degrees come to signify debauch . We have ourselves outlived the old meaning of “ liberality , ” which is now another word for treason in one country and for infatuation in all . It seems to have been a strange mistake to accuse the author of The Prince , as being a pander to tyranny ; and to think that the Inquisition would condemn his work for such a delinquency . The fact is , that Machiavelli , as is usual with those against whom no crime can be proved , was suspected of and charged with atheism ; and the first and last most violent opposers of The Prince were both Jesuits , one of whom persuaded the Inquisition “ benchè fosse tardo , ” to prohibit the treatise , and the other qualified the secretary of the Florentine republic as no better than a fool . The father Possevin was proved never to have read the book , and the father Lucchesini not to have understood it . It is clear , however , that such critics must have objected not to the slavery of the doctrines , but to the supposed tendency of a lesson which shows how distinct are the interests of a monarch from the happiness of mankind . The Jesuits are re-established in Italy , and the last chapter of The Prince may again call forth a particular refutation from those who are employed once more in moulding the minds of the rising generation , so as to receive the impressions of despotism . The chapter [ xxvi . ] bears for title , “ Esortazione a liberare l'Italia da ’ Barbari , ” and concludes with a libertine excitement to the future redemption of Italy . “ Non si deve adunque lasciar passare questa occasione , acciocchè la Italia vegga dopo tanto tempo apparire un suo redentore . Nè posso esprimere con quale amore ei fusse ricevuto in tutte quelle provincie , che hanno patito per queste illuvioni esterne , con qual sete di vendetta , con che ostinata fede , con que pietà , con che lacrime . Quali porte se gli serrerebbero ? Quali popoli gli negherebbero l'ubbidienza ? Quale Italiano gli negherebbe l'ossequio ? AD OGNUNO PUZZA QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO . "[ 601 ]</p>

       <l n="1">Ungrateful Florence ! Dante sleeps afar .</l>
       <l n="2">Stanza lvii . line 1 .</l>
     </lg>
     <p>Dante was born in Florence , in the year 1261 . He fought in two battles , was fourteen times ambassador , and once prior of the republic . When the party of Charles of Anjou triumphed over the Bianchi , he was absent on an embassy to Pope Boniface VIII ., and was condemned to two years ’ banishment , and to a fine of 8000 lire ; on the non-payment of which he was further punished by the sequestration of all his property . The republic , however , was not content with this satisfaction , for in 1772 was discovered in the archives at Florence a sentence in which Dante is the eleventh of a list of fifteen condemned in 1302 to be burnt alive ; Talis perveniens igne comburatur sic quod moriatur . The pretext for this judgment was a proof of unfair barter , extortions , and illicit gains . Baracteriarum iniquarum extorsionum et illicitorum lucrorum ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 602 ]</span>and with such an accusation it is not strange that Dante should have always protested his innocence , and the injustice of his fellow-citizens . His appeal to Florence was accompanied by another to the Emperor Henry ; and the death of that Sovereign in 1313 was the signal for a sentence of irrevocable banishment . He had before lingered near Tuscany with hopes of recall ; then travelled into the north of Italy , where Verona had to boast of his longest residence ; and he finally settled at Ravenna , which was his ordinary but not constant abode until his death . The refusal of the Venetians to grant him a public audience , on the part of Guido Novello da Polenta , his protector , is said to have been the principal cause of this event , which happened in 1321 . He was buried ( “ in sacra minorum æde ” ) at Ravenna , in a handsome tomb , which was erected by Guido , restored by Bernardo Bembo in 1483 , prætor for that republic which had refused to hear him , again restored by Cardinal Corsi , in 1692 , and replaced by a more magnificent sepulchre , constructed in 1780 at the expense of the Cardinal Luigi Valenti Gonzaga . The offence or misfortune of Dante was an attachment to a defeated party , and , as his least favourable biographers allege against him , too great a freedom of speech and haughtiness of manner . But the next age paid honours almost divine to the exile . The Florentines , having in vain and frequently attempted to recover his body , crowned his image in a church ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 603 ]</span>and his picture is still one of the idols of their cathedral . They struck medals , they raised statues to him . The cities of Italy , not being able to dispute about his own birth , contended for that of his great poem , and the Florentines thought it for their honour to prove that he had finished the seventh Canto before they drove him from his native city . Fifty-one years after his death , they endowed a professorial chair for the expounding of his verses , and Boccaccio was appointed to this patriotic employment . The example was imitated by Bologna and Pisa , and the commentators , if they performed but little service to literature , augmented the veneration which beheld a sacred or moral allegory in all the images of his mystic muse . His birth and his infancy were discovered to have been distinguished above those of ordinary men : the author of the Decameron , his earliest biographer , relates that his mother was warned in a dream of the importance of her pregnancy : and it was found , by others , that at ten years of age he had manifested his precocious passion for that wisdom or theology , which , under the name of Beatrice , had been mistaken for a substantial mistress . When the Divine Comedy had been recognised as a mere mortal production , and at the distance of two centuries , when criticism and competition had sobered the judgment of the Italians , Dante was seriously declared superior to Homer ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 604 ]</span>and though the preference appeared to some casuists “ an heretical blasphemy worthy of the flames , ” the contest was vigorously maintained for nearly fifty years . In later times it was made a question which of the Lords of Verona could boast of having patronised him ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 605 ]</span>and the jealous scepticism of one writer would not allow Ravenna the undoubted possession of his bones . Even the critical Tiraboschi was inclined to believe that the poet had foreseen and foretold one of the discoveries of Galileo .— Like the great originals of other nations , his popularity has not always maintained the same level . The last age seemed inclined to undervalue him as a model and a study : and Bettinelli one day rebuked his pupil Monti , for poring over the harsh and obsolete extravagances of the Commedia . The present generation having recovered from the Gallic idolatries of Cesarotti , has returned to the ancient worship , and the Danteggiare of the northern Italians is thought even indiscreet by the more moderate Tuscans .</p>
     <p>There is still much curious information relative to the life and writings of this great poet , which has not as yet been collected even by the Italians ; but the celebrated Ugo Foscolo meditates to supply this defect , and it is not to be regretted that this national work has been reserved for one so devoted to his country and the cause of truth .</p>

     <p>The elder Scipio Africanus had a tomb if he was not buried at Liternum , whither he had retired to voluntary banishment .

     <p>Ingratitude is generally supposed the vice peculiar to republics ; and it seems to be forgotten that for one instance of popular inconstancy , we have a hundred examples of the fall of courtly favourites . Besides , a people have often repented — a monarch seldom or never . Leaving apart many familiar proofs of this fact , a short story may show the difference between even an aristocracy and the multitude .</p>
     <p>Vettor Pisani , having been defeated in 1354 at Portolongo , and many years afterwards in the more decisive action of Pola , by the Genoese , was recalled by the Venetian government , and thrown into chains . The Avvogadori proposed to behead him , but the supreme tribunal was content with the sentence of imprisonment . Whilst Pisani was suffering this unmerited disgrace , Chioza , in the vicinity of the capital ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 608 ]</span>was , by the assistance of the Signor of Padua , delivered into the hands of Pietro Doria . At the intelligence of that disaster , the great bell of St. Mark 's tower tolled to arms , and the people and the soldiery of the galleys were summoned to the repulse of the approaching enemy ; but they protested they would not move a step , unless Pisani were liberated and placed at their head . The great council was instantly assembled : the prisoner was called before them , and the Doge , Andrea Contarini , informed him of the demands of the people , and the necessities of the state , whose only hope of safety was reposed in his efforts , and who implored him to forget the indignities he had endured in her service . “ I have submitted , ” replied the magnanimous republican , “ I have submitted to your deliberations without complaint ; I have supported patiently the pains of imprisonment , for they were inflicted at your command : this is no time to inquire whether I deserved them — the good of the republic may have seemed to require it , and that which the republic resolves is always resolved wisely . Behold me ready to lay down my life for the preservation of my country . ” Pisani was appointed generalissimo , and , by his exertions , in conjunction with those of Carlo Zeno , the Venetians soon recovered the ascendancy over their maritime rivals .</p>
     <p>The Italian communities were no less unjust to their citizens than the Greek republics . Liberty , both with the one and the other , seems to have been a national , not an individual object : and , notwithstanding the boasted equality before the laws , which an ancient Greek writer<span type="note_anchor">[ 609 ]</span>considered the great distinctive mark between his countrymen and the barbarians , the mutual rights of fellow citizens seem never to have been the principal scope of the old democracies . The world may have not yet seen an essay by the author of The Italian Republics , in which the distinction between the liberty of former states , and the signification attached to that word by the happier constitution of England , is ingeniously developed . The Italians , however , when they had ceased to be free , still looked back with a sigh upon those times of turbulence , when every citizen might rise to a share of sovereign power , and have never been taught fully to appreciate the repose of a monarchy . Sperone Speroni , when Francis Maria II . Duke of Rovere proposed the question , “ which was preferable , the republic or the principality — the perfect and not durable , or the less perfect and not so liable to change , ” replied , “ that our happiness is to be measured by its quality , not by its duration ; and that he preferred to live for one day like a man , than for a hundred years like a brute , a stock , or a stone . ” This was thought , and called a magnificent answer down to the last days of Italian servitude .<span type="note_anchor">[ 610 ]</span></p>

     <p>The Florentines did not take the opportunity of Petrarch 's short visit to their city in 1350 to revoke the decree which confiscated the property of his father , who had been banished shortly after the exile of Dante . His crown did not dazzle them ; but when in the next year they were in want of his assistance in the formation of their university , they repented of their injustice , and Boccaccio was sent to Padua to entreat the laureate to conclude his wanderings in the bosom of his native country , where he might finish his immortal Africa , and enjoy , with his recovered possessions , the esteem of all classes of his fellow citizens . They gave him the option of the book and the science he might condescend to expound : they called him the glory of his country , who was dear , and who would be dearer to them ; and they added , that if there was anything unpleasing in their letter , he ought to return amongst them , were it only to correct their style .<span type="note_anchor">[ 611 ]</span>Petrarch seemed at first to listen to the flattery and to the entreaties of his friend , but he did not return to Florence , and preferred a pilgrimage to the tomb of Laura and the shades of Vaucluse .</p>

     <p>Boccaccio was buried in the church of St. Michael and St. James , at Certaldo , a small town in the Valdelsa , which was by some supposed the place of his birth . There he passed the latter part of his life in a course of laborious study , which shortened his existence ; and there might his ashes have been secure , if not of honour , at least of repose . But the “ hyena bigots ” of Certaldo tore up the tombstone of Boccaccio and ejected it from the holy precincts of St. Michael and St. James . The occasion , and , it may be hoped , the excuse , of this ejectment was the making of a new floor for the church ; but the fact is , that the tombstone was taken up and thrown aside at the bottom of the building . Ignorance may share the sin with bigotry . It would be painful to relate such an exception to the devotion of the Italians for their great names , could it not be accompanied by a trait more honourably conformable to the general character of the nation . The principal person of the district , the last branch of the house of Medicis , afforded that protection to the memory of the insulted dead which her best ancestors had dispensed upon all contemporary merit . The Marchioness Lenzoni rescued the tombstone of Boccaccio from the neglect in which it had some time lain , and found for it an honourable elevation in her own mansion . She has done more : the house in which the poet lived has been as little respected as his tomb , and is falling to ruin over the head of one indifferent to the name of its former tenant . It consists of two or three little chambers , and a low tower , on which Cosmo II . affixed an inscription . This house she has taken measures to purchase , and proposes to devote to it that care and consideration which are attached to the cradle and to the roof of genius .</p>
     <p>This is not the place to undertake the defence of Boccaccio ; but the man who exhausted his little patrimony in the acquirement of learning , who was amongst the first , if not the first , to allure the science and the poetry of Greece to the bosom of Italy ;— who not only invented a new style , but founded , or certainly fixed , a new language ; who , besides the esteem of every polite court of Europe , was thought worthy of employment by the predominant republic of his own country , and , what is more , of the friendship of Petrarch , who lived the life of a philosopher and a freeman , and who died in the pursuit of knowledge ,— such a man might have found more consideration than he has met with from the priest of Certaldo , and from a late English traveller , who strikes off his portrait as an odious , contemptible , licentious writer , whose impure remains should be suffered to rot without a record .<span type="note_anchor">[ 612 ]</span>That English traveller , unfortunately for those who have to deplore the loss of a very amiable person , is beyond all criticism ; but the mortality which did not protect Boccaccio from Mr. Eustace , must not defend Mr. Eustace from the impartial judgment of his successors . Death may canonise his virtues , not his errors ; and it may be modestly pronounced that he transgressed , not only as an author , but as a man , when he evoked the shade of Boccaccio in company with that of Aretine , amidst the sepulchres of Santa Croce , merely to dismiss it with indignity . As far as respects</p>

     <p>it is of little import what censure is passed upon a coxcomb who owes his present existence to the above burlesque character given to him by the poet , whose amber has preserved many other grubs and worms : but to classify Boccaccio with such a person , and to excommunicate his very ashes , must of itself make us doubt of the qualification of the classical tourist for writing upon Italian , or , indeed , upon any other literature ; for ignorance on one point may incapacitate an author merely for that particular topic , but subjection to a professional prejudice must render him an unsafe director on all occasions . Any perversion and injustice may be made what is vulgarly called a “ case of conscience , ” and this poor excuse is all that can be offered for the priest of Certaldo , or the author of the Classical Tour . It would have answered the purpose to confine the censure to the novels of Boccaccio ; and gratitude to that source which supplied the muse of Dryden with her last and most harmonious numbers might , perhaps , have restricted that censure to the objectionable qualities of the hundred tales . At any rate the repentance of Boccaccio might have arrested his exhumation , and it should have been recollected and told , that in his old age he wrote a letter entreating his friend to discourage the reading of the Decameron , for the sake of modesty , and for the sake of the author , who would not have an apologist always at hand to state in his excuse that he wrote it when young , and at the command of his superiors .<span type="note_anchor">[ 613 ]</span>It is neither the licentiousness of the writer , nor the evil propensities of the reader , which have given to the Decameron alone , of all the works of Boccaccio , a perpetual popularity . The establishment of a new and delightful dialect conferred an immortality on the works in which it was first fixed . The sonnets of Petrarch were , for the same reason , fated to survive his self-admired Africa , “ the favourite of kings . ” The invariable traits of nature and feeling with which the novels , as well as the verses , abound , have doubtless been the chief source of the foreign celebrity of both authors ; but Boccaccio , as a man , is no more to be estimated by that work , than Petrarch is to be regarded in no other light than as the lover of Laura . Even , however , had the father of the Tuscan prose been known only as the author of the Decameron , a considerate writer would have been cautious to pronounce a sentence irreconcilable with the unerring voice of many ages and nations . An irrevocable value has never been stamped upon any work solely recommended by impurity .</p>
     <p>The true source of the outcry against Boccaccio , which began at a very early period , was the choice of his scandalous personages in the cloisters as well as the courts ; but the princes only laughed at the gallant adventures so unjustly charged upon queen Theodelinda , whilst the priesthood cried shame upon the debauches drawn from the convent and the hermitage ; and most probably for the opposite reason , namely , that the picture was faithful to the life . Two of the novels are allowed to be facts usefully turned into tales to deride the canonisation of rogues and laymen . Ser Ciappelletto and Marcellinus are cited with applause even by the decent Muratori .<span type="note_anchor">[ 614 ]</span>The great Arnaud , as he is quoted in Bayle , states , that a new edition of the novels was proposed , of which the expurgation consisted in omitting the words “ monk ” and “ nun , ” and tacking the immoralities to other names . The literary history of Italy particularises no such edition ; but it was not long before the whole of Europe had but one opinion of the Decameron ; and the absolution of the author seems to have been a point settled at least a hundred years ago : “ On se feroit siffler si l ’ on prétendoit convaincre Boccace de n'avoir pas été honnête homme , puis qu'il a fait le Décameron . ” So said one of the best men , and perhaps the best critic that ever lived — the very martyr to impartiality .<span type="note_anchor">[ 615 ]</span>But as this information , that in the beginning of the last century one would have been hooted at for pretending that Boccaccio was not a good man , may seem to come from one of those enemies who are to be suspected , even when they make us a present of truth , a more acceptable contrast with the proscription of the body , soul , and muse of Boccaccio may be found in a few words from the virtuous , the patriotic contemporary , who thought one of the tales of this impure writer worthy a Latin version from his own pen . “ I have remarked elsewhere , ” says Petrarch , writing to Boccaccio , “ that the book itself has been worried by certain dogs , but stoutly defended by your staff and voice . Nor was I astonished , for I have had proof of the vigour of your mind , and I know you have fallen on that unaccommodating incapable race of mortals , who , whatever they either like not , or know not , or cannot do , are sure to reprehend in others ; and on those occasions only put on a show of learning and eloquence , but otherwise are entirely dumb . "[ 616 ]</p>
     <p>It is satisfactory to find that all the priesthood do not resemble those of Certaldo , and that one of them who did not possess the bones of Boccaccio would not lose the opportunity of raising a cenotaph to his memory . Bevius , canon of Padua , at the beginning of the sixteenth century , erected at Arquà , opposite to the tomb of the Laureate , a tablet , in which he associated Boccaccio to the equal honours of Dante and of Petrarch .</p>

     <p>Our veneration for the Medici begins with Cosmo and expires with his grandson ; that stream is pure only at the source ; and it is in search of some memorial of the virtuous republicans of the family that we visit the church of St. Lorenzo at Florence . The tawdry , glaring , unfinished chapel in that church , designed for the mausoleum of the Dukes of Tuscany , set round with crowns and coffins , gives birth to no emotions but those of contempt for the lavish vanity of a race of despots , whilst the pavement slab , simply inscribed to the Father of his Country , reconciles us to the name of Medici .<span type="note_anchor">[ 617 ]</span>It was very natural for Corinna<span type="note_anchor">[ 618 ]</span>to suppose that the statue raised to the Duke of Urbino in the capella de ’ depositi , was intended for his great namesake ; but the magnificent Lorenzo is only the sharer of a coffin half hidden in a niche of the sacristy . The decay of Tuscany dates from the sovereignty of the Medici . Of the sepulchral peace which succeeded to the establishment of the reigning families in Italy , our own Sidney has given us a glowing , but a faithful picture . “ Notwithstanding all the seditions of Florence , and other cities of Tuscany , the horrid factions of Guelphs and Ghibelins , Neri and Bianchi , nobles and commons , they continued populous , strong , and exceeding rich ; but in the space of less than a hundred and fifty years , the peaceable reign of the Medices is thought to have destroyed nine parts in ten of the people of that province . Amongst other things it is remarkable , that when Philip II . of Spain gave Sienna to the Duke of Florence , his ambassador then at Rome sent him word , that he had given away more than 650 , 000 subjects ; and it is not believed there are now 20 , 000 souls inhabiting that city and territory . Pisa , Pistoia , Arezzo , Cortona , and other towns , that were then good and populous , are in the like proportion diminished , and Florence more than any . When that city had been long troubled with seditions , tumults , and wars , for the most part unprosperous , they still retained such strength , that when Charles VIII . of France , being admitted as a friend with his whole army , which soon after conquered the kingdom of Naples , thought to master them , the people , taking arms , struck such a terror into him , that he was glad to depart upon such conditions as they thought fit to impose . Machiavel reports , that in that time Florence alone , with the Val d'Arno , a small territory belonging to that city , could , in a few hours , by the sound of a bell , bring together 135 , 000 well-armed men ; whereas now that city , with all the others in that province , are brought to such despicable weakness , emptiness , poverty , and baseness , that they can neither resist the oppressions of their own prince , nor defend him or themselves if they were assaulted by a foreign enemy . The people are dispersed or destroyed , and the best families sent to seek habitations in Venice , Genoa , Rome , Naples , and Lucca . This is not the effect of war or pestilence ; they enjoy a perfect peace , and suffer no other plague than the government they are under . "[ 619 ] From the usurper Cosmo down to the imbecile Gaston , we look in vain for any of those unmixed qualities which should raise a patriot to the command of his fellow-citizens . The Grand Dukes , and particularly the third Cosmo , had operated so entire a change in the Tuscan character , that the candid Florentines , in excuse for some imperfections in the philanthropic system of Leopold , are obliged to confess that the sovereign was the only liberal man in his dominions . Yet that excellent prince himself had no other notion of a national assembly , than of a body to represent the wants and wishes , not the will of the people .</p>

     <p>An Earthquake reeled unheededly away ! Stanza lxiii . line 5 .</p>
     <p>“ And such was their mutual animosity , so intent were they upon the battle , that the earthquake , which overthrew in great part many of the cities of Italy , which turned the course of rapid streams , poured back the sea upon the rivers , and tore down the very mountains , was not felt by one of the combatants . "[ 620 ] Such is the description of Livy . It may be doubted whether modern tactics would admit of such an abstraction .</p>
     <p>The site of the battle of Thrasimene is not to be mistaken . The traveller from the village under Cortona to Casa di Piano , the next stage on the way to Rome , has for the first two or three miles , around him , but more particularly to the right , that flat land which Hannibal laid waste in order to induce the Consul Flaminius to move from Arezzo . On his left , and in front of him , is a ridge of hills bending down towards the lake of Thrasimene , called by Livy “ montes Cortonenses , ” and now named the Gualandra . These hills he approaches at Ossaja , a village which the itineraries pretend to have been so denominated from the bones found there : but there have been no bones found there , and the battle was fought on the other side of the hill . From Ossaja the road begins to rise a little , but does not pass into the roots of the mountains until the sixty-seventh milestone from Florence . The ascent thence is not steep but perpetual , and continues for twenty minutes . The lake is soon seen below on the right , with Borghetto , a round tower , close upon the water ; and the undulating hills partially covered with wood , amongst which the road winds , sink by degrees into the marshes near to this tower . Lower than the road , down to the right amidst these woody hillocks , Hannibal placed his horse ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 621 ]</span>in the jaws of , or rather above the pass , which was between the lake and the present road , and most probably close to Borghetto , just under the lowest of the “ tumuli . "[ 622 ] On a summit to the left , above the road , is an old circular ruin , which the peasants call “ the tower of Hannibal the Carthaginian . ” Arrived at the highest point of the road , the traveller has a partial view of the fatal plain , which opens fully upon him as he descends the Gualandra . He soon finds himself in a vale enclosed to the left , and in front and behind him by the Gualandra hills , bending round in a segment larger than a semicircle , and running down at each end to the lake , which obliques to the right and forms the chord of this mountain arc . The position cannot be guessed at from the plains of Cortona , nor appears to be so completely enclosed unless to one who is fairly within the hills . It then , indeed , appears “ a place made as it were on purpose for a snare , ” locus insidiis natus . “ Borghetto is then found to stand in a narrow marshy pass close to the hill , and to the lake , whilst there is no other outlet at the opposite turn of the mountains than through the little town of Passignano , which is pushed into the water by the foot of a high rocky acclivity . ” There is a woody eminence branching down from the mountains into the upper end of the plain nearer to the side of Passignano , and on this stands a white village called Torre . Polybius seems to allude to this eminence as the one on which Hannibal encamped , and drew out his heavy-armed Africans and Spaniards in a conspicuous position .<span type="note_anchor">[ 623 ]</span>From this spot he despatched his Balearic and light-armed troops round through the Gualandra heights to the right , so as to arrive unseen and form an ambush amongst the broken acclivities which the road now passes , and to be ready to act upon the left flank and above the enemy , whilst the horse shut up the pass behind . Flaminius came to the lake near Borghetto at sunset ; and , without sending any spies before him , marched through the pass the next morning before the day had quite broken , so that he perceived nothing of the horse and light troops above and about him , and saw only the heavy-armed Carthaginians in front on the hill of Torre . The consul began to draw out his army in the flat , and in the mean time the horse in ambush occupied the pass behind him at Borghetto . Thus the Romans were completely enclosed , having the lake on the right , the main army on the hill of Torre in front , the Gualandra hills filled with the light-armed on their left flank , and being prevented from receding by the cavalry , who , the further they advanced , stopped up all the outlets in the rear . A fog rising from the lake now spread itself over the army of the consul , but the high lands were in the sunshine , and all the different corps in ambush looked towards the hill of Torre for the order of attack . Hannibal gave the signal , and moved down from his post on the height . At the same moment all his troops on the eminences behind and in the flank of Flaminius rushed forwards as it were with one accord into the plain . The Romans , who were forming their array in the mist , suddenly heard the shouts of the enemy amongst them on every side , and before they could fall into their ranks , or draw their swords , or see by whom they were attacked , felt at once that they were surrounded and lost . There are two little rivulets which run from the Gualandra into the lake . The traveller crosses the first of these at about a mile after he comes into the plain , and this divides the Tuscan from the Papal territories . The second , about a quarter of a mile further on , is called “ the bloody rivulet ; ” and the peasants point out an open spot to the left between the “ Sanguinetto ” and the hills , which , they say , was the principal scene of slaughter . The other part of the plain is covered with thick-set olive-trees in corn grounds , and is nowhere quite level , except near the edge of the lake . It is , indeed , most probable that the battle was fought near this end of the valley , for the six thousand Romans , who , at the beginning of the action , broke through the enemy , escaped to the summit of an eminence which must have been in this quarter , otherwise they would have had to traverse the whole plain , and to pierce through the main army of Hannibal .</p>
     <p>The Romans fought desperately for three hours ; but the death of Flaminius was the signal for a general dispersion . The Carthaginian horse then burst in upon the fugitives , and the lake , the marsh about Borghetto , but chiefly the plain of the Sanguinetto and the passes of the Gualandra , were strewed with dead . Near some old walls on a bleak ridge to the left above the rivulet , many human bones have been repeatedly found , and this has confirmed the pretensions and the name of the “ stream of blood . ”</p>
     <p>Every district of Italy has its hero . In the north some painter is the usual genius of the place , and the foreign Julio Romano more than divides Mantua with her native Virgil .<span type="note_anchor">[ 624 ]</span>To the south we hear of Roman names . Near Thrasimene tradition is still faithful to the fame of an enemy , and Hannibal the Carthaginian is the only ancient name remembered on the banks of the Perugian lake . Flaminius is unknown ; but the postilions on that road have been taught to show the very spot where Il Console Romano was slain . Of all who fought and fell in the battle of Thrasimene , the historian himself has , besides the generals and Maharbal , preserved indeed only a single name . You overtake the Carthaginian again on the same road to Rome . The antiquary , that is , the hostler of the posthouse at Spoleto , tells you that his town repulsed the victorious enemy , and shows you the gate still called Porta di Annibale . It is hardly worth while to remark that a French travel writer , well known by the name of the President Dupaty , saw Thrasimene in the lake of Bolsena , which lay conveniently on his way from Sienna to Rome .</p>

     <p>The projected division of the Spada Pompey has already been recorded by the historian of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . Mr. Gibbon found it in the memorials of Flaminius Vacca ; and it may be added to his mention of it , that Pope Julius III . gave the contending owners five hundred crowns for the statue , and presented it to Cardinal Capo di Ferro , who had prevented the judgment of Solomon from being executed upon the image . In a more civilised age this statue was exposed to an actual operation : for the French , who acted the Brutus of Voltaire in the Coliseum , resolved that their Cæsar should fall at the base of that Pompey , which was supposed to have been sprinkled with the blood of the original dictator . The nine-foot hero was therefore removed to the arena of the amphitheatre , and , to facilitate its transport , suffered the temporary amputation of its right arm . The republican tragedians had to plead that the arm was a restoration : but their accusers do not believe that the integrity of the statue would have protected it . The love of finding every coincidence , has discovered the true Cæsarian ichor in a stain near the right knee ; but colder criticism has rejected not only the blood , but the portrait , and assigned the globe of power rather to the first of the emperors than to the last of the republican masters of Rome . Winckelmann<span type="note_anchor">[ 625 ]</span>is loth to allow an heroic statue of a Roman citizen , but the Grimani Agrippa , a contemporary almost , is heroic ; and naked Roman figures were only very rare , not absolutely forbidden . The face accords much better with the “ hominem integrum et castum et gravem ,"[ 626 ] than with any of the busts of Augustus , and is too stern for him who was beautiful , says Suetonius , at all periods of his life . The pretended likeness to Alexander the Great cannot be discerned , but the traits resemble the medal of Pompey .<span type="note_anchor">[ 627 ]</span>The objectionable globe may not have been an ill-applied flattery to him who found Asia Minor the boundary , and left it the centre of the Roman empire . It seems that Winckelmann has made a mistake in thinking that no proof of the identity of this statue with that which received the bloody sacrifice can be derived from the spot where it was discovered .<span type="note_anchor">[ 628 ]</span>Flaminius Vacca says sotto una cantina , and this cantina is known to have been in the Vicolo de ’ Leutari , near the Cancellaria ; a position corresponding exactly to that of the Janus before the basilica of Pompey 's theatre , to which Augustus transferred the statue after the curia was either burnt or taken down .<span type="note_anchor">[ 629 ]</span>Part of the “ Pompeian shade ,"[ 630 ] the portico , existed in the beginning of the XVth century , and the atrium was still called Satrum . So says Blondus .<span type="note_anchor">[ 631 ]</span>At all events , so imposing is the stern majesty of the statue , and so memorable is the story , that the play of the imagination leaves no room for the exercise of the judgment , and the fiction , if a fiction it is , operates on the spectator with an effect not less powerful than truth .</p>

     <p>And thou , the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome ! Stanza lxxxviii . line 1 .</p>
     <p>Ancient Rome , like modern Sienna , abounded most probably with images of the foster-mother of her founder ; but there were two she-wolves of whom history makes particular mention . One of these , of brass in ancient work , was seen by Dionysius<span type="note_anchor">[ 632 ]</span>at the temple of Romulus , under the Palatine , and is universally believed to be that mentioned by the Latin historian , as having been made from the money collected by a fine on usurers , and as standing under the Ruminal fig-tree .<span type="note_anchor">[ 633 ]</span>The other was that which Cicero<span type="note_anchor">[ 634 ]</span>has celebrated both in prose and verse , and which the historian Dion also records as having suffered the same accident as is alluded to by the orator .<span type="note_anchor">[ 635 ]</span>The question agitated by the antiquaries is , whether the wolf now in the Conservator 's Palace is that of Livy and Dionysius , or that of Cicero , or whether it is neither one nor the other . The earlier writers differ as much as the moderns : Lucius Faunus<span type="note_anchor">[ 636 ]</span>says , that it is the one alluded to by both , which is impossible , and also by Virgil , which may be . Fulvius Ursinus<span type="note_anchor">[ 637 ]</span>calls it the wolf of Dionysius , and Marlianus<span type="note_anchor">[ 638 ]</span>talks of it as the one mentioned by Cicero . To him Rycquius tremblingly assents .<span type="note_anchor">[ 639 ]</span>Nardini is inclined to suppose it may be one of the many wolves preserved in ancient Rome ; but of the two rather bends to the Ciceronian statue .<span type="note_anchor">[ 640 ]</span>Montfaucon<span type="note_anchor">[ 641 ]</span>mentions it as a point without doubt . Of the latter writers the decisive Winckelmann<span type="note_anchor">[ 642 ]</span>proclaims it as having been found at the church of Saint Theodore , where , or near where , was the temple of Romulus , and consequently makes it the wolf of Dionysius . His authority is Lucius Faunus , who , however , only says that it was placed , not found , at the Ficus Ruminalis , by the Comitium , by which he does not seem to allude to the church of Saint Theodore . Rycquius was the first to make the mistake , and Winckelmann followed Rycquius .</p>
     <p>Flaminius Vacca tells quite a different story , and says he had heard the wolf with the twins was found<span type="note_anchor">[ 643 ]</span>near the arch of Septimius Severus . The commentator on Winckelmann is of the same opinion with that learned person , and is incensed at Nardini for not having remarked that Cicero , in speaking of the wolf struck with lightning in the Capitol , makes use of the past tense . But , with the Abate 's leave , Nardini does not positively assert the statue to be that mentioned by Cicero , and if he had , the assumption would not perhaps have been so exceedingly indiscreet . The Abate himself is obliged to own that there are marks very like the scathing of lightning in the hinder legs of the present wolf ; and , to get rid of this , adds , that the wolf seen by Dionysius might have been also struck by lightning , or otherwise injured .</p>
     <p>Let us examine the subject by a reference to the words of Cicero . The orator in two places seems to particularise the Romulus and the Remus , especially the first , which his audience remembered to have been in the Capitol , as being struck with lightning . In his verses he records that the twins and wolf both fell , and that the latter left behind the marks of her feet . Cicero does not say that the wolf was consumed : and Dion only mentions that it fell down , without alluding , as the Abate has made him , to the force of the blow , or the firmness with which it had been fixed . The whole strength , therefore , of the Abate 's argument hangs upon the past tense ; which , however , may be somewhat diminished by remarking that the phrase only shows that the statue was not then standing in its former position . Winckelmann has observed that the present twins are modern ; and it is equally clear that there are marks of gilding on the wolf , which might therefore be supposed to make part of the ancient group . It is known that the sacred images of the Capitol were not destroyed when injured by time or accident , but were put into certain underground depositories , called favissæ .<span type="note_anchor">[ 644 ]</span>It may be thought possible that the wolf had been so deposited , and had been replaced in some conspicuous situation when the Capitol was rebuilt by Vespasian . Rycquius , without mentioning his authority , tells that it was transferred from the Comitium to the Lateran , and thence brought to the Capitol . If it was found near the arch of Severus , it may have been one of the images which Orosius<span type="note_anchor">[ 645 ]</span>says was thrown down in the Forum by lightning when Alaric took the city . That it is of very high antiquity the workmanship is a decisive proof ; and that circumstance induced Winckelmann to believe it the wolf of Dionysius . The Capitoline wolf , however , may have been of the same early date as that at the temple of Romulus . Lactantius<span type="note_anchor">[ 646 ]</span>asserts that in his time the Romans worshipped a wolf ; and it is known that the Lupercalia held out to a very late period<span type="note_anchor">[ 647 ]</span>after every other observance of the ancient superstition had totally expired . This may account for the preservation of the ancient image longer than the other early symbols of Paganism .</p>
     <p>It may be permitted , however , to remark , that the wolf was a Roman symbol , but that the worship of that symbol is an inference drawn by the zeal of Lactantius . The early Christian writers are not to be trusted in the charges which they make against the Pagans . Eusebius accused the Romans to their faces of worshipping Simon Magus , and raising a statue to him in the island of the Tyber . The Romans had probably never heard of such a person before , who came , however , to play a considerable , though scandalous part in the church history , and has left several tokens of his aërial combat with St. Peter at Rome ; notwithstanding that an inscription found in this very island of the Tyber showed the Simon Magus of Eusebius to be a certain indigenal god called Semo Sangus or Fidius .<span type="note_anchor">[ 648 ]</span></p>
     <p>Even when the worship of the founder of Rome had been abandoned it was thought expedient to humour the habits of the good matrons of the city , by sending them with their sick infants to the church of Saint Theodore , as they had before carried them to the temple of Romulus .<span type="note_anchor">[ 649 ]</span>The practice is continued to this day ; and the site of the above church seems to be thereby identified with that of the temple ; so that if the wolf had been really found there , as Winckelmann says , there would be no doubt of the present statue being that seen by Dionysius .<span type="note_anchor">[ 650 ]</span>But Faunus , in saying that it was at the Ficus Ruminalis by the Comitium , is only talking of its ancient position as recorded by Pliny ; and , even if he had been remarking where it was found , would not have alluded to the church of Saint Theodore , but to a very different place , near which it was then thought the Ficus Ruminalis had been , and also the Comitium ; that is , the three columns by the church of Santa Maria Liberatrice , at the corner of the Palatine looking on the Forum .</p>
     <p>It is , in fact , a mere conjecture where the image was actually dug up ; and perhaps , on the whole , the marks of the gilding , and of the lightning , are a better argument in favour of its being the Ciceronian wolf than any that can be adduced for the contrary opinion . At any rate , it is reasonably selected in the text of the poem as one of the most interesting relics of the ancient city ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 651 ]</span>and is certainly the figure , if not the very animal to which Virgil alludes in his beautiful verses :—</p>

     <p>It is possible to be a very great man and to be still very inferior to Julius Cæsar , the most complete character , so Lord Bacon thought , of all antiquity . Nature seems incapable of such extraordinary combinations as composed his versatile capacity , which was the wonder even of the Romans themselves . The first general — the only triumphant politician — inferior to none in eloquence — comparable to any in the attainments of wisdom , in an age made up of the greatest commanders , statesmen , orators , and philosophers that ever appeared in the world — an author who composed a perfect specimen of military annals in his travelling carriage — at one time in a controversy with Cato , at another writing a treatise on punning , and collecting a set of good sayings — fighting and making love at the same moment , and willing to abandon both his empire and his mistress for a sight of the Fountains of the Nile . Such did Julius Cæsar appear to his contemporaries , and to those of the subsequent ages who were the most inclined to deplore and execrate his fatal genius .</p>
     <p>But we must not be so much dazzled with his surpassing glory , or with his magnanimous , his amiable qualities , as to forget the decision of his impartial countrymen :—</p>

     <p>The respectable authority of Flaminius Vacca would incline us to believe in the claims of the Egerian grotto .<span type="note_anchor">[ 654 ]</span>He assures us that he saw an inscription in the pavement , stating that the fountain was that of Egeria , dedicated to the nymphs . The inscription is not there at this day , but Montfaucon quotes two lines<span type="note_anchor">[ 655 ]</span>of Ovid [ Fast ., iii . 275 , 276 ] from a stone in the Villa Giustiniani , which he seems to think had been brought from the same grotto .</p>
     <p>This grotto and valley were formerly frequented in summer , and particularly the first Sunday in May , by the modern Romans , who attached a salubrious quality to the fountain which trickles from an orifice at the bottom of the vault , and , overflowing the little pools , creeps down the matted grass into the brook below . The brook is the Ovidian Almo , whose name and qualities are lost in the modern Aquataccio . The valley itself is called Valle di Caffarelli , from the dukes of that name who made over their fountain to the Pallavicini , with sixty rubbia of adjoining land .</p>
     <p>There can be little doubt that this long dell is the Egerian valley of Juvenal , and the pausing place of Umbritius , notwithstanding the generality of his commentators have supposed the descent of the satirist and his friend to have been into the Arician grove , where the nymph met Hippolitus , and where she was more peculiarly worshipped .</p>
     <p>The step from the Porta Capena to the Alban hill , fifteen miles distant , would be too considerable , unless we were to believe in the wild conjecture of Vossius , who makes that gate travel from its present station , where he pretends it was during the reign of the Kings , as far as the Arician grove , and then makes it recede to its old site with the shrinking city .<span type="note_anchor">[ 656 ]</span>The tufo , or pumice , which the poet prefers to marble , is the substance composing the bank in which the grotto is sunk .</p>
     <p>The modern topographers<span type="note_anchor">[ 657 ]</span>find in the grotto the statue of the nymph , and nine niches for the Muses ; and a late traveller<span type="note_anchor">[ 658 ]</span>has discovered that the cave is restored to that simplicity which the poet regretted had been exchanged for injudicious ornament . But the headless statue is palpably rather a male than a nymph , and has none of the attributes ascribed to it at present visible . The nine Muses could hardly have stood in six niches ; and Juvenal certainly does not allude to any individual cave .<span type="note_anchor">[ 659 ]</span>Nothing can be collected from the satirist but that somewhere near the Porta Capena was a spot in which it was supposed Numa held nightly consultations with his nymph , and where there was a grove and a sacred fountain , and fanes once consecrated to the Muses ; and that from this spot there was a descent into the valley of Egeria , where were several artificial caves . It is clear that the statues of the Muses made no part of the decoration which the satirist thought misplaced in these caves ; for he expressly assigns other fanes ( delubra ) to these divinities above the valley , and moreover tells us that they had been ejected to make room for the Jews . In fact , the little temple now called that of Bacchus , was formerly thought to belong to the Muses , and Nardini<span type="note_anchor">[ 660 ]</span>places them in a poplar grove , which was in his time above the valley .</p>
     <p>It is probable from the inscription and position , that the cave now shown may be one of the “ artificial caverns , ” of which , indeed , there is another a little way higher up the valley , under a tuft of alder bushes ; but a single grotto of Egeria is a mere modern invention , grafted upon the application of the epithet Egerian to these nymphea in general , and which might send us to look for the haunts of Numa upon the banks of the Thames .</p>
     <p>Our English Juvenal was not seduced into mistranslation by his acquaintance with Pope : he carefully preserves the correct plural —</p>
     <lg>
       <l n="1">“ Thence slowly winding down the vale we view</l>
       <l n="2">The Egerian grots : oh , how unlike the true ! ”</l>
     </lg>
     <p>The valley abounds with springs ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 661 ]</span>and over these springs , which the Muses might haunt from their neighbouring groves , Egeria presided : hence she was said to supply them with water ; and she was the nymph of the grottos through which the fountains were taught to flow .</p>
     <p>The whole of the monuments in the vicinity of the Egerian valley have received names at will , which have been changed at will . Venuti<span type="note_anchor">[ 662 ]</span>owns he can see no traces of the temples of Jove , Saturn , Juno , Venus , and Diana , which Nardini found , or hoped to find . The mutatorium of Caracalla 's circus , the temple of Honour and Virtue , the temple of Bacchus , and , above all , the temple of the god Rediculus , are the antiquaries ’ despair .</p>
     <p>The circus of Caracalla depends on a medal of that emperor cited by Fulvius Ursinus , of which the reverse shows a circus , supposed , however , by some to represent the Circus Maximus . It gives a very good idea of that place of exercise . The soil has been but little raised , if we may judge from the small cellular structure at the end of the Spina , which was probably the chapel of the god Consus . This cell is half beneath the soil , as it must have been in the circus itself ; for Dionysius<span type="note_anchor">[ 663 ]</span>could not be persuaded to believe that this divinity was the Roman Neptune , because his altar was underground .</p>

     <p>We read in Suetonius , that Augustus , from a warning received in a dream ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 664 ]</span>counterfeited , once a year , the beggar , sitting before the gate of his palace with his hand hollowed and stretched out for charity . A statue formerly in the villa Borghese , and which should be now at Paris , represents the Emperor in that posture of supplication . The object of that self-degradation was the appeasement of Nemesis , the perpetual attendant on good fortune , of whose power the Roman conquerors were also reminded by certain symbols attached to their cars of triumph . The symbols were the whip and the crotalo , which were discovered in the Nemesis of the Vatican . The attitude of beggary made the above statue pass for that of Belisarius : and until the criticism of Winckelmann<span type="note_anchor">[ 665 ]</span>had rectified the mistake , one fiction was called in to support another . It was the same fear of the sudden termination of prosperity , that made Amasis king of Egypt warn his friend Polycrates of Samos , that the gods loved those whose lives were chequered with good and evil fortunes . Nemesis was supposed to lie in wait particularly for the prudent ; that is , for those whose caution rendered them accessible only to mere accidents ; and her first altar was raised on the banks of the Phrygian Æsepus by Adrastus , probably the prince of that name who killed the son of Croesus by mistake . Hence the goddess was called Adrastea .<span type="note_anchor">[ 666 ]</span></p>
     <p>The Roman Nemesis was sacred and august : there was a temple to her in the Palatine under the name of Rhamnusia ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 667 ]</span>so great , indeed , was the propensity of the ancients to trust to the revolution of events , and to believe in the divinity of Fortune , that in the same Palatine there was a temple to the Fortune of the day .<span type="note_anchor">[ 668 ]</span>This is the last superstition which retains its hold over the human heart ; and , from concentrating in one object the credulity so natural to man , has always appeared strongest in those unembarrassed by other articles of belief . The antiquaries have supposed this goddess to be synonymous with Fortune and with Fate ;<span type="note_anchor">[ 669 ]</span>but it was in her vindictive quality that she was worshipped under the name of Nemesis .</p>

     <p>Gladiators were of two kinds , compelled and voluntary ; and were supplied from several conditions ;— from slaves sold for that purpose ; from culprits ; from barbarian captives either taken in war , and , after being led in triumph , set apart for the games , or those seized and condemned as rebels ; also from free citizens , some fighting for hire ( auctorati ) , others from a depraved ambition ; at last even knights and senators were exhibited ,— a disgrace of which the first tyrant was naturally the first inventor .<span type="note_anchor">[ 670 ]</span>In the end , dwarfs , and even women , fought ; an enormity prohibited by Severus . Of these the most to be pitied undoubtedly were the barbarian captives ; and , to this species a Christian writer<span type="note_anchor">[ 671 ]</span>justly applies the epithet “ innocent , ” to distinguish them from the professional gladiators . Aurelian and Claudius supplied great numbers of these unfortunate victims ; the one after his triumph , and the other on the pretext of a rebellion .<span type="note_anchor">[ 672 ]</span>No war , says Lipsius ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 673 ]</span>was ever so destructive to the human race as these sports . In spite of the laws of Constantine and Constans , gladiatorial shows survived the old established religion more than seventy years ; but they owed their final extinction to the courage of a Christian . In the year 404 , on the kalends of January , they were exhibiting the shows in the Flavian amphitheatre before the usual immense concourse of people . Almachius , or Telemachus , an Eastern monk , who had travelled to Rome intent on his holy purpose , rushed into the midst of the arena , and endeavoured to separate the combatants . The Prætor Alypius , a person incredibly attached to these games ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 674 ]</span>gave instant orders to the gladiators to slay him ; and Telemachus gained the crown of martyrdom , and the title of saint , which surely has never either before or since been awarded for a more noble exploit . Honorius immediately abolished the shows , which were never afterwards revived . The story is told by Theodoret<span type="note_anchor">[ 675 ]</span>and Cassiodorus ,<span type="note_anchor">[ 676 ]</span>and seems worthy of credit notwithstanding its place in the Roman martyrology .<span type="note_anchor">[ 677 ]</span>Besides the torrents of blood which flowed at the funerals , in the amphitheatres , the circus , the forums , and other public places , gladiators were introduced at feasts , and tore each other to pieces amidst the supper tables , to the great delight and applause of the guests . Yet Lipsius permits himself to suppose the loss of courage , and the evident degeneracy of mankind , to be nearly connected with the abolition of these bloody spectacles .</p>

       <l n="1">Here , where the Roman million 's blame or praise</l>

     </lg>
     <p>When one gladiator wounded another , he shouted , “ He has it , ” “ Hoc habet , ” or “ Habet . ” The wounded combatant dropped his weapon , and advancing to the edge of the arena , supplicated the spectators . If he had fought well , the people saved him ; if otherwise , or as they happened to be inclined , they turned down their thumbs , and he was slain . They were occasionally so savage that they were impatient if a combat lasted longer than ordinary without wounds or death . The emperor 's presence generally saved the vanquished ; and it is recorded , as an instance of Caracalla 's ferocity , that he sent those who supplicated him for life , in a spectacle , at Nicomedia , to ask the people ; in other words , handed them over to be slain . A similar ceremony is observed at the Spanish bull-fights . The magistrate presides ; and after the horseman and piccadores have fought the bull , the matadore steps forward and bows to him for permission to kill the animal . If the bull has done his duty by killing two or three horses , or a man , which last is rare , the people interfere with shouts , the ladies wave their handkerchiefs , and the animal is saved . The wounds and death of the horses are accompanied with the loudest acclamations , and many gestures of delight , especially from the female portion of the audience , including those of the gentlest blood . Every thing depends on habit . The author of Childe Harold , the writer of this note , and one or two other Englishmen , who have certainly in other days borne the sight of a pitched battle , were , during the summer of 1809 , in the governor 's box at the great amphitheatre of Santa Maria , opposite to Cadiz . The death of one or two horses completely satisfied their curiosity . A gentleman present , observing them shudder and look pale , noticed that unusual reception of so delightful a sport to some young ladies , who stared and smiled , and continued their applause as another horse fell bleeding to the ground . One bull killed three horses , off his own horns . He was saved by acclamations , which were redoubled when it was known he belonged to a priest .</p>
     <p>An Englishman who can be much pleased with seeing two men beat themselves to pieces , cannot bear to look at a horse galloping round an arena with his bowels trailing on the ground , and turns from the spectacle and the spectators with horror and disgust .</p>

     <p>The whole declivity of the Alban hill is of unrivalled beauty , and from the convent on the highest point , which has succeeded to the temple of the Latian Jupiter , the prospect embraces all the objects alluded to in the cited stanza ; the Mediterranean ; the whole scene of the latter half of the Æneid , and the coast from beyond the mouth of the Tiber to the headland of Circæum and the Cape of Terracina .</p>
     <p>The site of Cicero 's villa may be supposed either at the Grotta Ferrata , or at the Tusculum of Prince Lucien Buonaparte .</p>
     <p>The former was thought some years ago the actual site , as may be seen from Myddleton 's Life of Cicero . At present it has lost something of its credit , except for the Domenichinos . Nine monks of the Greek order live there , and the adjoining villa is a cardinal 's summer-house . The other villa , called Rufinella , is on the summit of the hill above Frascati , and many rich remains of Tusculum have been found there , besides seventy-two statues of different merit and preservation , and seven busts .</p>
     <p>From the same eminence are seen the Sabine hills , embosomed in which lies the long valley of Rustica . There are several circumstances which tend to establish the identity of this valley with the “ Ustica ” of Horace ; and it seems possible that the mosaic pavement which the peasants uncover by throwing up the earth of a vineyard may belong to his villa . Rustica is pronounced short , not according to our stress upon — “ Usticæ cubantis . ” It is more rational to think that we are wrong , than that the inhabitants of this secluded valley have changed their tone in this word . The addition of the consonant prefixed is nothing ; yet it is necessary to be aware that Rustica may be a modern name which the peasants may have caught from the antiquaries .</p>
     <p>The villa , or the mosaic , is in a vineyard on a knoll covered with chestnut trees . A stream runs down the valley ; and although it is not true , as said in the guide books , that this stream is called Licenza , yet there is a village on a rock at the head of the valley , which is so denominated , and which may have taken its name from the Digentia . Licenza contains seven hundred inhabitants . On a peak a little way beyond is Civitella , containing three hundred . On the banks of the Anio , a little before you turn up into Valle Rustica , to the left , about an hour from the villa , is a town called Vicovaro , another favourable coincidence with the Varia of the poet . At the end of the valley , towards the Anio , there is a bare hill , crowned with a little town called Bardela . At the foot of this hill the rivulet of Licenza flows , and is almost absorbed in a wide sandy bed before it reaches the Anio . Nothing can be more fortunate for the lines of the poet , whether in a metaphorical or direct sense :—</p>
     <lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="1">
       <l n="1">“ Me quotiens reficit gelidus Digentia rivus ,</l>
       <l n="2">Quem Mandela bibit rugosus frigore pagus . ”</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza" n="2">
       <l n="3">The stream is clear high up the valley , but before it reaches the hill</l>
       <l n="4">of Bardela looks green and yellow like a sulphur rivulet .</l>
      </lg>
     </lg>
     <p>Rocca Giovane , a ruined village in the hills , half an hour 's walk from the vineyard where the pavement is shown , does seem to be the site of the fane of Vacuna , and an inscription found there tells that this temple of the Sabine Victory was repaired by Vespasian . With these helps , and a position corresponding exactly to every thing which the poet has told us of his retreat , we may feel tolerably secure of our site .</p>
     <p>The hill which should be Lucretilis is called Campanile , and by following up the rivulet to the pretended Bandusia , you come to the roots of the higher mountain Gennaro . Singularly enough , the only spot of ploughed land in the whole valley is on the knoll where this Bandusia rises .</p>
     <p>" ... tu frigus amabile Fessis vomere tauris Præbes , et pecori vago . ”</p>
     <p>The peasants show another spring near the mosaic pavement , which they call “ Oradina , ” and which flows down the hills into a tank , or mill-dam , and thence trickles over into the Digentia .</p>
     <p>But we must not hope</p>
     <p>“ To trace the Muses upwards to their spring , ”</p>
     <p>by exploring the windings of the romantic valley in search of the Bandusian fountain . It seems strange that any one should have thought Bandusia a fountain of the Digentia — Horace has not let drop a word of it ; and this immortal spring has in fact been discovered in possession of the holders of many good things in Italy , the monks . It was attached to the church of St. Gervais and Protais near Venusia , where it was most likely to be found .<span type="note_anchor">[ 678 ]</span>We shall not be so lucky as a late traveller in finding the “ occasional pine ” still pendent on the poetic villa . There is not a pine in the whole valley , but there are two cypresses , which he evidently took , or mistook , for the tree in the ode .<span type="note_anchor">[ 679 ]</span>The truth is , that the pine is now , as it was in the days of Virgil , a garden tree , and it was not at all likely to be found in the craggy acclivities of the valley of Rustica . Horace probably had one of them in the orchard close above his farm , immediately overshadowing his villa , not on the rocky heights at some distance from his abode . The tourist may have easily supposed himself to have seen this pine figured in the above cypresses ; for the orange and lemon trees which throw such a bloom over his description of the royal gardens at Naples , unless they have been since displaced , were assuredly only acacias and other common garden shrubs .<span type="note_anchor">[ 680 ]</span></p>
