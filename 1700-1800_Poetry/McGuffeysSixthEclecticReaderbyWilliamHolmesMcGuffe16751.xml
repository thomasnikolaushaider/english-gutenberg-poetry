    <docImprint>XLVIII . “ HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP . ” ( 195 ) Elizabeth Barrett Browning ,<date>1809-1861</date>, was born in<settlement>London</settlement>, married the poet Robert Browning in<date>1846</date>, and afterwards resided in<country>Italy</country>most of the time till her death , which occurred at Florence . She was thoroughly educated in severe and masculine studies , and began to write at a very early age . Her “ Essay on Mind , ” a metaphysical and reflective poem , was written at the age of sixteen . She wrote very rapidly , and her friend , Miss Mitford , tells us that “ Lady Geraldine 's Courtship , ” containing ninety - three stanzas , was composed in twelve hours ! She published several other long poems , “ Aurora Leigh ” being one of the most highly finished . Mrs. Browning is regarded as one of the most able female poets of modern times ; but her writings are often obscure , and some have doubted whether she always clearly conceived what she meant to express . She had a warm sympathy with all forms of suffering and distress . “ He Giveth his Beloved Sleep ” is one of the most beautiful of her minor poems . The thought is an amplification of verse 2d of Psalm cxxvii . ###</docImprint>

   <p>XLIX . DESCRIPTION OF A SIEGE . ( 197 )</p>
   <p>“ The skirts of the wood seem lined with archers , although only a few are advanced from its dark shadow . ” “ Under what banner ? ” asked Ivanhoe . “ Under no ensign which I can observe , ” answered Rebecca . “ A singular novelty , ” muttered the knight , “ to advance to storm such a castle without pennon or banner displayed . Seest thou who they be that act as leaders ? ” “ A knight clad in sable armor is the most conspicuous , ” said the Jewess : “ he alone is armed from head to heel , and seems to assume the direction of all around him . ”</p>
   <p>“ Seem there no other leaders ? ” exclaimed the anxious inquirer . “ None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station , ” said Rebecca , “ but doubtless the other side of the castle is also assailed . They seem , even now , preparing to advance . God of Zion protect us ! What a dreadful sight ! Those who advance first bear huge shields and defenses made of plank : the others follow , bending their bows as they come on . They raise their bows ! God of Moses , forgive the creatures thou hast made ! ”</p>
   <p>Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault , which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle , and at once answered by a flourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements , which , mingled with the deep and hollow clang of the kettledrums , retorted in notes of defiance the challenge of the enemy . The shouts of both parties augmented the fearful din , the assailants crying , “ Saint George , for merry England ! ” and the Normans answering them with loud cries of “ Onward , De Bracy ! Front de Boeuf , to the rescue ! ”</p>
   <p>“ And I must lie here like a bedridden monk , ” exclaimed Ivanhoe , “ while the game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of others ! Look from the window once again , kind maiden , and tell me if they yet advance to the storm . ” With patient courage , strengthened by the interval which she had employed in mental devotion , Rebecca again took post at the lattice , sheltering herself , however , so as not to be exposed to the arrows of the archers . “ What dost thou see , Rebecca ? ” again demanded the wounded knight . “ Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes , and to hide the bowmen who shoot them . ” “ That can not endure , ” said Ivanhoe . “ If they press not right on , to carry the castle by force of arms , the archery may avail but little against stone walls and bulwarks . Look for the knight in dark armor , fair Rebecca , and see how he bears himself ; for as the leader is , so will his followers be . ”</p>
   <p>“ I see him not , ” said Rebecca . “ Foul craven ! ” exclaimed Ivanhoe ; “ does he blench from the helm when the wind blows highest ? ” “ He blenches not ! he blenches not ! ” said Rebecca ; “ I see him now : he leads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbacan . They pull down the piles and palisades ; they hew down the barriers with axes . His high black plume floats abroad over the throng like a raven over the field of the slain . They have made a breach in the barriers , they rush in , they are thrust back ! Front de Boeuf heads the defenders . I see his gigantic form above the press . They throng again to the breach , and the pass is disputed , hand to hand , and man to man . God of Jacob ! it is the meeting of two fierce tides , the conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds ; ” and she turned her head from the window as if unable longer to endure a sight so terrible .</p>
   <p>Speedily recovering her self-control , Rebecca again looked forth , and almost immediately exclaimed , “ Holy prophets of the law ! Front de Boeuf and the Black Knight fight hand to hand on the breach , amid the roar of their followers , who watch the progress of the strife . Heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed and of the captive ! ” She then uttered a loud shriek , and exclaimed , “ He is down ! he is down ! ” “ Who is down ! ” cried Ivanhoe ; “ for our dear Lady 's sake , tell me which has fallen ! ” “ The Black Knight , ” answered Rebecca , faintly ; then instantly again shouted with joyful eagerness — “ But no ! but no ! the name of the Lord of Hosts be blessed ! he is on foot again , and fights as if there were twenty men 's strength in his single arm — his sword is broken — he snatches an ax from a yeoman — he presses Front de Boeuf , blow on blow — the giant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the woodman — he falls-he falls ! ” “ Front de Boeuf ? ” exclaimed Ivanhoe . “ Front de Boeuf , ” answered the Jewess ; “ his men rush to the rescue , headed by the haughty Templar , — their united force compels the champion to pause — they drag Front de Boeuf within the walls . ”</p>
   <p>“ The assailants have won the barriers , have they not ? ” said Ivanhoe . “ They have — they have — and they press the besieged hard upon the outer wall ; some plant ladders , some swarm like bees , and endeavor to ascend upon the shoulders of each other ; down go stones , beams , and trunks of trees upon their heads , and as fast as they bear the wounded to the rear , fresh men supply their places in the assault . Great God ! hast thou given men thine own image that it should be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren ! ” “ Think not of that , ” replied Ivanhoe ; “ this is no time for such thoughts . Who yield ? Who push their way ? ”</p>
   <p>“ The ladders are thrown down , ” replied Rebecca , shuddering ; “ the soldiers lie groveling under them like crushed reptiles ; the besieged have the better . ” “ Saint George strike for us ! ” said the knight ; “ do the false yeomen give way ? ” “ No , ” exclaimed Rebecca , “ they bear themselves right yeomanly ; the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge ax ; the thundering blows which he deals , you may hear them above all the din and shouts of the battle ; stones and beams are hailed down on the brave champion ; he regards them no more than if they were thistle down and feathers . ”</p>
   <p>“ Saint John of Acre ! ” said Ivanhoe , raising himself joyfully on his couch , “ methought there was but one man in England that might do such a deed . ” “ The postern gate shakes , ” continued Rebecca ; “ it crashes — it is splintered by his powerful blows — they rush in — the outwork is won ! O God ! they hurry the defenders from the battlements — they throw them into the moat ! O men , if ye be indeed men , spare them that can resist no longer ! ” “ The bridge — the bridge which communicates with the castle — have they won that pass ? ” exclaimed Ivanhoe . “ No , ” replied Rebecca ; “ the Templar has destroyed the plank on which they crossed — few of the defenders escaped with him into the castle — the shrieks and cries which you hear , tell the fate of the others . Alas ! I see that it is still more difficult to look upon victory than upon battle . ”</p>
   <p>“ What do they now , maiden ? ” said Ivanhoe ; “ look forth yet again — this is no time to faint at bloodshed . ” “ It is over , for a time , ” said Rebecca ; “ our friends strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have mastered . ” “ Our friends , ” said Ivanhoe , “ will surely not abandon an enterprise so gloriously begun , and so happily attained ; Oh no ! I will put my faith in the good knight whose ax has rent heart of oak and bars of iron . Singular , ” he again muttered to himself , “ if there can be two who are capable of such achievements . It is ,— it must be Richard Coeur de Lion . ”</p>
   <p>“ Seest thou nothing else . Rebecca , by which the Black Knight may be distinguished ? ” “ Nothing , ” said the Jewess , “ all about him is as black as the wing of the night raven . Nothing can I spy that can mark him further ; but having once seen him put forth his strength in battle , methinks I could know him again among a thousand warriors . He rushes to the fray as if he were summoned to a banquet . There is more than mere strength ; it seems as if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every blow which he deals upon his enemies . God forgive him the sin of bloodshed ! it is fearful , yet magnificent , to behold how the arm and heart of one man can triumph over hundreds . ” — Walter Scott .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Ivanhoe , a wounded knight , and Rebecca , a Jewess , had been imprisoned in the castle of Reginald Front de Boeuf . The friends of the prisoners undertake their rescue . At the request of Ivanhoe , who is unable to leave his couch , Rebecca takes her stand near a window overlooking the approach to the castle , and details to the knight the incidents of the contest as they take place . Front de Boeuf and his garrison were Normans ; the besiegers , Saxons .</p>
   <p>The castles of this time ( twelfth century ) usually consisted of a keep , or castle proper , surrounded at some distance by two walls , one within the other . Each wall was encircled on its outer side by a moat , or ditch , which was filled with water , and was crossed by means of a drawbridge . Before the main entrance of the outer wall was an outwork called the barbacan , which was a high wall surmounted by battlements and turrets , built to defend the gate and drawbridge . Here , also , were placed barriers of palisades , etc ., to impede the advance of an attacking force . The postern gate was small , and was usually some distance from the ground ; it was used for the egress of messengers during a siege ;</p>

    <head>L. MARCO BOZZARIS . ( 202 )</head>
    <head>Fitz-Greene Halleck , 1790 — 1867 , was born in Guilford , Connecticut . At the age of eighteen he entered a banking house in New York , where he remained a long time . For many years he was bookkeeper and assistant in business for John Jacob Astor . Nearly all his poems were written before he was forty years old , several of them in connection with his friend Joseph Rodman Drake . His “ Young America , ” however , was written but a few years before his death . Mr. Halleck 's poetry is carefully finished and musical ; much of it is sportive , and some satirical . No one of his poems is better known than “ Marco Bozzaris . ” ###</head>

   <p>NOTES .— Marco Bozzaris ( b. about 1790 , d. 1823 ) was a famous Greek patriot . His family were Suliotes , a people inhabiting the Suli Mountains , and bitter enemies of the Turks . Bozzaris was engaged in war against the latter nearly all his life , and finally fell in a night attack upon their camp near Carpenisi . This poem , a fitting tribute to his memory , has been translated into modern Greek .</p>
   <p>Plataea was the scene of a great victory of the Greeks over the Persians in the year 479 B. C .</p>

    <head>LI . SONG OF THE GREEK BARD . ( 205 )</head>
    <head>George Gordon Byron , Lord Byron , 1788-1824 . This gifted poet was the son of a profligate father and of a fickle and passionate mother . He was afflicted with lameness from his birth ; and , although he succeeded to his great-uncle 's title at ten years of age , he inherited financial embarrassment with it . These may be some of the reasons for the morbid and wayward character of the youthful genius . It is certain that he was not lacking in affection , nor in generosity . In his college days , at Cambridge , he was willful and careless of his studies . “ Hours of Idleness , ” his first book , appeared in 1807 . It was severely treated by the “ Edinburgh Review , ” which called forth his “ English Bards and Scotch Reviewers , ” in 1809 . Soon after , he went abroad for two years ; and , on his return , published the first two cantos of “ Childe Harold 's Pligrimage , ” a work that made him suddenly famous . He married in 1815 , but separated from his wife after one year . Soured and bitter , he now left England , purposing never to return . He spent most of the next seven years in Italy , where most of his poems were written . The last year of his life was spent in Greece , aiding in her struggle for liberty against the Turks . He died at Missolonghi . As a man , Byron was impetuous , morbid and passionate . He was undoubtedly dissipated and immoral , but perhaps to a less degree than has sometimes been asserted . As a poet , he possessed noble powers , and he has written much that will last ; in general , however , his poetry is not wholesome , and his fame is less than it once was . ###</head>

   <p>NOTES .— Sappho was a Greek poetess living on the island of Lesbos , about 600 B. C. Delos is one of the Grecian Archipelago , and is of volcanic origin . The ancient Greeks believed that it rose from the sea at a stroke from Neptune 's trident , and was moored fast to the bottom by Jupiter . It was the supposed birthplace of Phoebus , or Apollo . The island of Chios , or Scios , is one of the places which claim to be the birthplace of Homer . Teios , or Teos , a city in Ionia , is the birthplace of the Greek poet Anacreon . The Islands of the Blest , mentioned in ancient poetry , were imaginary islands in the west , where , it was believed , the favorites of the gods were conveyed without dying .</p>
   <p>At Marathon . ( 490 B. C .) , on the east coast , of Greece , 11 , 000 Greeks , under the generalship of Miltiades , routed 110 , 000 Persians . The island of Salamis lies very near the Greek coast : in the narrow channel between , the Greek fleet almost destroyed ( 480 B. C . ) that of Xerxes , the Persian king , who witnessed the contest from a throne on the mountain side . Thermopylae is a narrow mountain pass in Greece , where Leonidas , with 300 Spartans and about 1 , 100 other Greeks , held the entire Persian army in check until every Spartan , except one , was slain . Samos is one of the Grecian Archipelago , noted for its cultivation of the vine and olive .</p>
   <p>A Bacchanal was a disciple of Bacchus , the god of wine . Pyrrhus was a Greek , and one of the greatest generals of the world . The phalanx was an almost invincible arrangement of troops , massed in close array , with their shields overlapping one another , and their spears projecting ; this form of military tactics was peculiar to the Greeks .</p>
   <p>Polycrates seized the island of Samos , and made himself tyrant : he was entrapped and crucified in 522 B. C. Chersonese is the ancient name for a peninsula . Sunium is the name of a promontory southeast of Athens .</p>
   <p>LII . NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS . ( 209 )</p>
   <p>Charles Sprague , 1791-1875 , was born in Boston , and received his education in the public schools of that city . For sixteen years he was engaged in mercantile pursuits , as clerk and partner . In 1820 he became teller in a bank ; and , from 1825 , he filled the office of cashier of the Globe Bank for about forty years . In 1829 be gave his most famous poem , “ Curiosity , ” before the Phi Beta Kappa society , in Cambridge . An active man of business all his days , he has written but little either in prose or poetry , but that little is excellent in quality , graceful , and pleasing .</p>
   <p>The address from which this extract is taken , was delivered before the citizens of Boston , July 4th , 1825 . ###</p>
   <p>Not many generations ago , where you now sit , encircled with all that exalts and embellishes civilized life , the rank thistle nodded in the wind and the wild fox dug his hole unscared . Here lived and loved another race of beings . Beneath the same sun that rolls over your head , the Indian hunter pursued the panting deer ; gazing on the same moon that smiles for you , the Indian lover wooed his dusky mate . Here the wigwam blaze beamed on the tender and helpless , and the council fire glared on the wise and daring . Now they dipped their noble limbs in your sedgy lakes , and now they paddled the light canoe along your rocky shores . Here they warred ; the echoing whoop , the bloody grapple , the defying death song , all were here ; and when the tiger strife was over , here curled the smoke of peace .</p>
   <p>Here , too , they worshiped ; and from many a dark bosom went up a fervent prayer to the Great Spirit . He had not written his laws for them on tables of stone , but he had traced them on the tables of their hearts . The poor child of nature knew not the God of Revelation , but the God of the universe he acknowledged in everything around . He beheld him in the star that sank in beauty behind his lonely dwelling ; in the sacred orb that flamed on him from his midday throne ; in the flower that snapped in the morning breeze ; in the lofty pine that defied a thousand whirlwinds ; in the timid warbler that never left its native grove ; in the fearless eagle , whose untired pinion was wet in clouds ; in the worm that crawled at his feet ; and in his own matchless form , glowing with a spark of that light , to whose mysterious source he bent in humble though blind adoration .</p>
   <p>And all this has passed away . Across the ocean came a pilgrim bark , bearing the seeds of life and death . The former were sown for you ; the latter sprang up in the path of the simple native . Two hundred years have changed the character of a great continent , and blotted forever from its face a whole , peculiar people . Art has usurped the bowers of nature , and the anointed children of education have been too powerful for the tribes of the ignorant . Here and there a stricken few remain ; but how unlike their bold , untamable progenitors . The Indian of falcon glance and lion bearing , the theme of the touching ballad , the hero of the pathetic tale is gone , and his degraded offspring crawls upon the soil where he walked in majesty , to remind us how miserable is man when the foot of the conqueror is on his neck .</p>
   <p>As a race they have withered from the land . Their arrows are broken , their springs are dried up , their cabins are in the dust . Their council fire has long since gone out on the shore , and their war cry is fast fading to the untrodden west . Slowly and sadly they climb the distant mountains , and read their doom in the setting sun . They are shrinking before the mighty tide which is pressing them away ; they must soon hear the roar of the last wave which will settle over them forever . Ages hence , the inquisitive white man , as he stands by some growing city , will ponder on the structure of their disturbed remains , and wonder to what manner of persons they belonged . They will live only in the songs and chronicles of their exterminators . Let these be faithful to their rude virtues as men , and pay due tribute to their unhappy fate as a people .</p>

    <head>LIII . LOCHIEL 'S WARNING . ( 211 )</head>
    <head>Thomas Campbell , 1777-1844 , was a descendant of the famous clan of Campbells , in Kirnan , Scotland , and was born at Glasgow . At the age of thirteen he entered the university in that city , from which he graduated with distinction , especially as a Greek scholar ; his translations of Greek tragedy were considered without parallel in the history of the university . During the first year after graduation , he wrote several poems of minor importance . He then removed to Edinburgh and adopted literature as his profession ; here his “ Pleasures of Hope ” was published in 1799 , and achieved immediate success . He traveled extensively on the continent , and during his absence wrote “ Lochiel 's Warning , ” “ Hohenlinden , ” and other minor poems . In 1809 he published “ Gertrude of Wyoming ; ” from 1820 to 1830 he edited the “ New Monthly Magazine . ” In 1826 he was chosen lord rector of the University of Glasgow , to which office he was twice reelected . He was active in founding the University of London . During the last years of his life he produced but little of note . He died at Boulogne , in France . During most of his life he was in straitened pecuniary circumstances , and ill-health and family afflictions cast a melancholy over his later years . His poems were written with much care , and are uniformly smooth and musical . ###</head>

   <p>NOTES .— Lochiel was a brave and influential Highland chieftain . He espoused the cause of Charles Stuart , called the Pretender , who claimed the British throne . In the preceding piece , he is supposed to be marching with the warriors of his clan to join Charles 's army . On his way he is met by a Seer , who having , according to the popular superstition , the gift of second-sight , or prophecy , forewarns him of the disastrous event of the enterprise , and exhorts him to return home and avoid the destruction which certainly awaits him , and which afterward fell upon him at the battle of Culloden , in 1746 . In this battle the Highlanders were commanded by Charles in person , and the English by the Duke of Cumberland . The Highlanders wore completely routed , and the Pretender 's rebellion brought to a close . He himself shortly afterward made a narrow escape by water from the west of Scotland ; hence the reference to the fugitive king .</p>
   <p>Albin is the poetic name of Scotland , more particularly the Highlands . The ironbound prisoner refers to Lochiel .</p>
   <p>LIV . ON HAPPINESS OF TEMPER . ( 215 )</p>
   <p>Oliver Goldsmith , 1728-1774 . This eccentric son of genius was an Irishman ; his father was a poor curate . Goldsmith received his education at several preparatory schools , at Trinity College , Dublin , at Edinburgh , and at Leyden . He was indolent and unruly as a student , often in disgrace with his teachers ; but his generosity , recklessness , and love of athletic sports made him a favorite with his fellow-students . He spent some time in wandering over the continent , often in poverty and want . In 1756 he returned to England , and soon took up his abode in London . Here he made the acquaintance and friendship of several notable men , among whom were Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds . “ The Traveler ” was published in 1764 , and was soon followed by the “ Vicar of Wakefield . ” He wrote in nearly all departments of literature , and always with purity , grace , and fluency . His fame as a poet is secured by the “ Traveler ” and the “ Deserted Village ; ” as a dramatist , by “ She Stoops to Conquer ; ” as a satirist , by the “ Citizen of the World ; ” and as a novelist by the “ Vicar of Wakefield . ” In his later years his writings were the source of a large income , but his gambling , careless generosity , and reckless extravagance always kept him in financial difficulty , and he died heavily in debt . His monument is in Westminster Abbey . ##</p>
   <p>Writers of every age have endeavored to show that pleasure is in us , and not in the objects offered for our amusement . If the soul be happily disposed , everything becomes capable of affording entertainment , and distress will almost want a name . Every occurrence passes in review , like the figures of a procession ; some may be awkward , others ill-dressed , but none but a fool is on that account enraged with the master of ceremonies .</p>
   <p>I remember to have once seen a slave , in a fortification in Flanders , who appeared no way touched with his situation . He was maimed , deformed , and chained ; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till nightfall , and condemned to this for life ; yet , with all these circumstances of apparent wretchedness , he sang , would have danced , but that he wanted a leg , and appeared the merriest , happiest man of all the garrison . What a practical philosopher was here ! A happy constitution supplied philosophy , and though seemingly destitute of wisdom he was really wise . No reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairyland around him . Everything furnished him with an opportunity of mirth ; and though some thought him , from his insensibility , a fool , he was such an idiot as philosophers should wish to imitate .</p>
   <p>They who , like that slave , can place themselves all that side of the world in which everything appears in a pleasant light , will find something in every occurrence to excite their good humor . The most calamitous events , either to themselves or others , can bring no new affliction ; the world is to them a theater , in which only comedies are acted . All the bustle of heroism , or the aspirations of ambition , seem only to heighten the absurdity of the scene , and make the humor more poignant . They feel , in short , as little anguish at their own distress , or the complaints of others , as the undertaker , though dressed in black , feels sorrow at a funeral . Of all the men I ever read of , the famous Cardinal de Retz possessed this happiness in the highest degree . When fortune wore her angriest look , and he fell into the power of Cardinal Mazarin , his most deadly enemy , ( being confined a close prisoner in the castle of Valenciennes ,) he never attempted to support his distress by wisdom or philosophy , for he pretended to neither . He only laughed at himself ’ and his persecutor , and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation . In this mansion of distress , though denied all amusements , and even the conveniences of life , and entirely cut off from all intercourse with his friends , he still retained his good humor , laughed at the little spite of his enemies , and carried the jest so far as to write the life of his jailer .</p>
   <p>All that the wisdom of the proud can teach , is to be stubborn or sullen under misfortunes . The Cardinal 's example will teach us to be good - humored in circumstances of the highest affliction . It matters not whether our good humor be construed by others into insensibility or idiotism ,— it is happiness to ourselves ; and none but a fool could measure his satisfaction by what the world thinks of it .</p>
   <p>The happiest fellow I ever knew , was of the number of those good-natured creatures that are said to do no harm to anybody but themselves . Whenever he fell into any misery , he called it “ seeing life , ” If his head was broken by a chairman , or his pocket picked by a sharper , he comforted himself by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the one , or the more fashionable cant of the other . Nothing came amiss to him . His inattention to money matters had concerned his father to such a degree that all intercession of friends was fruitless . The old gentleman was on his deathbed . The whole family ( and Dick among the number ) gathered around him .</p>
   <p>“ I leave my second son , Andrew , ” said the expiring miser , “ my whole estate , and desire him to be frugal . ” Andrew , in a sorrowful tone ( as is usual on such occasions ) , prayed heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himself . “ I recommend Simon , my third son , to the care of his elder brother , and leave him , besides , four thousand pounds . ” “ Ah , father ! ” cried Simon ( in great affliction , to be sure ) , “ may heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself ! ” At last , turning to poor Dick : “ As for you , you have always been a sad dog ; you 'll never come to good ; you 'll never be rich ; I leave you a shilling to buy a halter . ” “ Ah , father ! ” cries Dick , without any emotion , “ may heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourself ! ”</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Cardinal de Retz , Jean Francois Paul de Gondi ( b . 1614 , d. 1679 ) , was leader of the revolt against Jules Mazarin ( b . 1602 , d. 1661 ) , the prime minister of France during the minority of Louis XIV . This led to a war which lasted four or five years . After peace had been concluded , and Louis XIV . established on the throne , Mazarin was reinstated in power , and Cardinal de Retz was imprisoned .</p>

   <p>LV . THE FORTUNE TELLER . ( 218 )</p>
   <p>Henry Mackenzie , 1745-1831 , was born in Edinburgh , educated at the university there , and died in the same city . He was an attorney by profession , and was the associate of many famous literary men residing at that time in Edinburgh . His fame as a writer rests chiefly on two novels , “ The Man of Feeling ” and “ The Man of the World ; ” both were published before the author was forty years old . ###</p>
   <p>Harley sat down on a large stone by the wayside , to take a pebble from his shoe , when he saw , at some distance , a beggar approaching him . He had on a loose sort of coat , mended with different-colored rags , among which the blue and russet were predominant . He had a short , knotty stick in his hand , and on the top of it was stuck a ram 's horn ; he wore no shoes , and his stockings had entirely lost that part of them which would have covered his feet and ankles ; in his face , however , was the plump appearance of good humor ; he walked a good , round pace , and a crook-legged dog trotted at his heels .</p>
   <p>“ Our delicacies , ” said Harley to himself , “ are fantastic ; they are not in nature ! That beggar walks over the sharpest of these stones barefooted , whilst I have lost the most delightful dream in the world from the smallest of them happening to get into my shoe . ” The beggar had by this time come up , and , pulling off a piece of a hat , asked charity of Harley . The dog began to beg , too . It was impossible to resist both ; and , in truth , the want of shoes and stockings had made both unnecessary , for Harley had destined sixpence for him before .</p>
   <p>The beggar , on receiving it , poured forth blessings without number ; and , with a sort of smile on his countenance , said to Harley that if he wanted to have his fortune told — Harley turned his eye briskly upon the beggar ; it was an unpromising look for the subject of a prediction , and silenced the prophet immediately . “ I would much rather learn ” said Harley , “ what it is in your power to tell me . Your trade must be an entertaining one ; sit down on this stone , and let me know something of your profession ; I have often thought of turning fortune teller for a week or two , myself . ”</p>
   <p>“ Master , ” replied the beggar , “ I like your frankness much , for I had the humor of plain dealing in me from a child ; but there is no doing with it in this world ,— we must do as we can ; and lying is , as you call it , my profession . But I was in some sort forced to the trade , for I once dealt in telling the truth . I was a laborer , sir , and gained as much as to make me live . I never laid by , indeed , for I was reckoned a piece of a wag , and your wags , I take it , are seldom rich , Mr. Harley . ” “ So , ” said Harley , “ you seem to know me . ” “ Ay , there are few folks in the country that I do  n't know something of . How should I tell fortunes else ? ” “ True ,— but go on with your story ; you were a laborer , you say , and a wag ; your industry , I suppose , you left with your old trade ; but your humor you preserved to be of use to you in your new . ”</p>
   <p>“ What signifies sadness , sir ? A man grows lean on ‘ t. But I was brought to my idleness by degrees ; sickness first disabled me , and it went against my stomach to work , ever after . But , in truth , I was for a long time so weak that I spit blood whenever I attempted to work . I had no relation living , and I never kept a friend above a week when I was able to joke . Thus I was forced to beg my bread , and a sorry trade I have found it , Mr. Harley . I told all my misfortunes truly , but they were seldom believed ; and the few who gave me a half-penny as they passed , did it with a shake of the head , and an injunction not to trouble them with a long story . In short , I found that people do  n't care to give alms without some security for their money ,— such as a wooden leg , or a withered arm , for example . So I changed my plan , and instead of telling my own misfortunes , began to prophesy happiness to others .</p>
   <p>“ This I found by much the better way . Folks will always listen when the tale is their own , and of many who say they do not believe in fortune telling , I have known few on whom it had not a very sensible effect . I pick up the names of their acquaintance ; amours and little squabbles are easily gleaned from among servants and neighbors ; and , indeed , people themselves are the best intelligencers in the world for our purpose . They dare not puzzle us for their own sakes , for everyone is anxious to hear what he wishes to believe ; and they who repeat it , to laugh at it when they have done , are generally more serious than their hearers are apt to imagine . With a tolerably good memory , and some share of cunning , I succeed reasonably well as a fortune teller . With this , and showing the tricks of that dog , I make shift to pick up a livelihood .</p>
   <p>“ My trade is none of the most honest , yet people are not much cheated after all , who give a few half-pence for a prospect of happiness , which I have heard some persons say , is all a man can arrive at in this world . But I must bid you good day , sir ; for I have three miles to walk before noon , to inform some boarding-school young ladies whether their husbands are to be peers of the realm or captains in the army ; a question which I promised to answer them by that time . ”</p>
   <p>Harley had drawn a shilling from his pocket ; but Virtue bade him to consider on whom he was going to bestow it . Virtue held back his arm ; but a milder form , a younger sister of Virtue 's , not so severe as Virtue , nor so serious as Pity , smiled upon him ; his fingers lost their compression ; nor did Virtue appear to catch the money as it fell . It had no sooner reached the ground than the watchful cur ( a trick he had been taught ) snapped it up ; and , contrary to the most approved method of stewardship , delivered it immediately into the hands of his master .</p>

    <head>LVI . RIENZI 'S ADDRESS TO THE ROMANS . ( 221 )</head>
    <head>Mary Russell Mitford , 1786-1855 . She was the daughter of a physician , and was born in Hampshire , England . At twenty years of age , she published three volumes of poems ; and soon after entered upon literature as a lifelong occupation . She wrote tales , sketches , poems , and dramas . “ Our Village ” is the best known of her prose works ; the book describes the daily life of a rural people , is simple but finished in style , and is marked by mingled humor and pathos . Her most noted drama is “ Rienzi . ” Miss Mitford passed the last forty years of her life in a little cottage in Berkshire , among a simple , country people , to whom she was greatly endeared by her kindness and social virtues . ###</head>

   <p>NOTES .— Rienzi ( b. about 1312 , d. 1354 ) was the last of the Roman tribunes . In 1347 he led a successful revolt against the nobles , who by their contentions kept Rome in constant turmoil . He then assumed the title of tribune , but , after indulging in a life of reckless extravagance and pomp for a few months , he was compelled to abdicate , and fly for his life . In 1354 he was reinstated in power , but his tyranny caused his assassination the same year .</p>

   <p>LVll . CHARACTER OF THE PURITAN FATHERS OF NEW ENGLAND . ( 223 )</p>
   <p>One of the most prominent features which distinguished our forefathers , was their determined resistance to oppression . They seemed born and brought up for the high and special purpose of showing to the world that the civil and religious rights of man — the rights of self-government , of conscience , and independent thought — are not merely things to be talked of and woven into theories , but to be adopted with the whole strength and ardor of the mind , and felt in the profoundest recesses of the heart , and carried out into the general life , and made the foundation of practical usefulness , and visible beauty , and true nobility .</p>
   <p>Liberty , with them , was an object of too serious desire and stern resolve to be personified , allegorized , and enshrined . They made no goddess of it , as the ancients did ; they had no time nor inclination for such trifling ; they felt that liberty was the simple birthright of every human creature ; they called it so ; they claimed it as such ; they reverenced and held it fast as the unalienable gift of the Creator , which was not to be surrendered to power , nor sold for wages .</p>
   <p>It was theirs , as men ; without it , they did not esteem themselves men ; more than any other privilege or possession , it was essential to their happiness , for it was essential to their original nature ; and therefore they preferred it above wealth , and ease , and country ; and , that they might enjoy and exercise it fully , they forsook houses , and lands , and kindred , their homes , their native soil , and their fathers ’ graves .</p>
   <p>They left all these ; they left England , which , whatever it might have been called , was not to them a land of freedom ; they launched forth on the pathless ocean , the wide , fathomless ocean , soiled not by the earth beneath , and bounded , all round and above , only by heaven ; and it seemed to them like that better and sublimer freedom , which their country knew not , but of which they had the conception and image in their hearts ; and , after a toilsome and painful voyage , they came to a hard and wintry coast , unfruitful and desolate , but unguarded and boundless ; its calm silence interrupted not the ascent of their prayers ; it had no eyes to watch , no ears to hearken , no tongues to report of them ; here , again , there was an answer to their soul 's desire , and they were satisfied , and gave thanks ; they saw that they were free , and the desert smiled .</p>
   <p>I am telling an old tale ; but it is one which must be told when we speak of those men . It is to be added , that they transmitted their principles to their children , and that , peopled by such a race , our country was always free . So long as its inhabitants were unmolested by the mother country in the exercise of their important rights , they submitted to the form of English government ; but when those rights were invaded , they spurned even the form away .</p>
   <p>This act was the Revolution , which came of course and spontaneously , and had nothing in it of the wonderful or unforeseen . The wonder would have been if it had not occurred . It was , indeed , a happy and glorious event , but by no means unnatural ; and I intend no slight to the revered actors in the Revolution when I assert that their fathers before them were as free as they — every whit as free .</p>
   <p>The principles of the Revolution were not the suddenly acquired property of a few bosoms : they were abroad in the land in the ages before ; they had always been taught , like the truths of the Bible ; they had descended from father to son , down from those primitive days , when the Pilgrim , established in his simple dwelling , and seated at his blazing fire , piled high from the forest which shaded his door , repeated to his listening children the story of his wrongs and his resistance , and bade them rejoice , though the wild winds and the wild beasts were howling without , that they had nothing to fear from great men 's oppression .</p>
   <p>Here are the beginnings of the Revolution . Every settler 's hearth was a school of independence ; the scholars were apt , and the lessons sunk deeply ; and thus it came that our country was always free ; it could not be other than free .</p>
   <p>As deeply seated as was the principle of liberty and resistance to arbitrary power in the breasts of the Puritans , it was not more so than their piety and sense of religious obligation . They were emphatically a people whose God was the Lord . Their form of government was as strictly theocratical , if direct communication be excepted , as was that of the Jews ; insomuch that it would be difficult to say where there was any civil authority among them entirely distinct from ecclesiastical jurisdiction .</p>
   <p>Whenever a few of them settled a town , they immediately gathered themselves into a church ; and their elders were magistrates , and their code of laws was the Pentateuch . These were forms , it is true , but forms which faithfully indicated principles and feelings ; for no people could have adopted such forms , who were not thoroughly imbued with the spirit , and bent on the practice , of religion .</p>
   <p>God was their King ; and they regarded him as truly and literally so , as if he had dwelt in a visible palace in the midst of their state . They were his devoted , resolute , humble subjects ; they undertook nothing which they did not beg of him to prosper ; they accomplished nothing without rendering to him the praise ; they suffered nothing without carrying their sorrows to his throne ; they ate nothing which they did not implore him to bless .</p>
   <p>Their piety was not merely external ; it was sincere ; it had the proof of a good tree in bearing good fruit ; it produced and sustained a strict morality . Their tenacious purity of manners and speech obtained for them , in the mother country , their name of Puritans , which , though given in derision , was as honorable an appellation as was ever bestowed by man on man .</p>
   <p>That there were hypocrites among them , is not to be doubted ; but they were rare . The men who voluntarily exiled themselves to an unknown coast , and endured there every toil and hardship for conscience ’ sake , and that they might serve God in their own manner , were not likely to set conscience at defiance , and make the service of God a mockery ; they were not likely to be , neither were they , hypocrites . I do not know that it would be arrogating too much for them to say , that , on the extended surface of the globe , there was not a single community of men to be compared with them , in the respects of deep religious impressions and an exact performance of moral duty .

   <p>NOTE .— The Pentateuch is the first five books of the Old Testament . The word is derived from two Greek words , ( pente ) , five , and ( tenchos ) , book .</p>
   <p>LVIII . LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS . ( 226 )</p>
   <p>Felicia Dorothea Hemans , 1794-1835 , was born in Liverpool . Her father , whose name was Browne , was an Irish merchant . She spent her childhood in Wales , began to write poetry at a very early age , and was married when about eighteen to Captain Hemans . By this marriage , she became the mother of five sons ; but , owing to differences of taste and disposition , her husband left her at the end of six years ; and by mutual agreement they never again lived together . Mrs. Hemans now made literature a profession , and wrote much and well . In 1826 Prof. Andrews Norton brought out an edition of her poems in America , where they became popular , and have remained so .</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hemans 's poetry is smooth and graceful , frequently tinged with a shade of melancholy , but never despairing , cynical , or misanthropic . It never deals with the highest themes , nor rises to sublimity , but its influence is calculated to make the reader truer , nobler , and purer . ###</p>

   <p>LIX . NECESSITY OF EDUCATION . ( 228 )</p>
   <p>We must educate ! We must educate ! or we must perish by our own prosperity . If we do not , short will be our race from the cradle to the grave . If , in our haste to be rich and mighty , we outrun our literary and religious institutions , they will never overtake us ; or only come up after the battle of liberty is fought and lost , as spoils to grace the victory , and as resources of inexorable despotism for the perpetuity of our bondage .</p>
   <p>But what will become of the West if her prosperity rushes up to such a majesty of power , while those great institutions linger which are necessary to form the mind , and the conscience , and the heart of the vast world ? It must not be permitted . And yet what is done must be done quickly ; for population will not wait , and commerce will not cast anchor , and manufactures will not shut off the steam , nor shut down the gate , and agriculture , pushed by millions of freemen on their fertile soil , will not withhold her corrupting abundance .</p>
   <p>And let no man at the East quiet himself , and dream of liberty , whatever may become of the West . Our alliance of blood , and political institutions , and common interests , is such , that we can not stand aloof in the hour of her calamity , should it ever come . Her destiny is our destiny ; and the day that her gallant ship goes down , our little boat sinks in the vortex !</p>
   <p>The great experiment is now making , and from its extent and rapid filling up , is making in the West , whether the perpetuity of our republican institutions can be reconciled with universal suffrage . Without the education of the head and heart of the nation , they can not be ; and the question to be decided is , can the nation , or the vast balance power of it , be so imbued with intelligence and virtue as to bring out , in laws and their administration , a perpetual self-preserving energy . We know that the work is a vast one , and of great difficulty ; and yet we believe it can be done .</p>
   <p>I am aware that our ablest patriots are looking out on the deep , vexed with storms , with great forebodings and failings of heart , for fear of the things that are coming upon us ; and I perceive a spirit of impatience rising , and distrust in respect to the perpetuity of our republic ; and I am sure that these fears are well founded , and am glad that they exist . It is the star of hope in our dark horizon . Fear is what we need , as the ship needs wind on a rocking sea , after a storm , to prevent foundering . But when our fear and our efforts shall correspond with our danger , the danger is past .</p>
   <p>For it is not the impossibility of self-preservation which threatens us ; nor is it the unwillingness of the nation to pay the price of the preservation , as she has paid the price of the purchase of our liberties . It is inattention and inconsideration , protracted till the crisis is past , and the things which belong to our peace are hid from our eyes . And blessed be God , that the tokens of a national waking up , the harbinger of God 's mercy , are multiplying upon us !</p>
   <p>We did not , in the darkest hour , believe that God had brought our fathers to this goodly land to lay the foundation of religious liberty , and wrought such wonders in their preservation , and raised their descendants to such heights of civil and religious liberty , only to reverse the analogy of his providence , and abandon his work .</p>
   <p>And though there now be clouds , and the sea roaring , and men 's hearts failing , we believe there is light behind the cloud , and that the imminence of our danger is intended , under the guidance of Heaven , to call forth and apply a holy , fraternal fellowship between the East and the West , which shall secure our preservation , and make the prosperity of our nation durable as time , and as abundant as the waves of the sea .</p>
   <p>I would add , as a motive to immediate action , that if we do fail in our great experiment of self-government , our destruction will be as signal as the birthright abandoned , the mercies abused , and the provocation offered to beneficent Heaven . The descent of desolation will correspond with the past elevation .</p>
   <p>No punishments of Heaven are so severe as those for mercies abused ; and no instrumentality employed in their infliction is so dreadful as the wrath of man . No spasms are like the spasms of expiring liberty , and no wailing such as her convulsions extort .</p>
   <p>It took Rome three hundred years to die ; and our death , if we perish , will be as much more terrific as our intelligence and free institutions have given us more bone , sinew , and vitality . May God hide from me the day when the dying agonies of my country shall begin ! O thou beloved land , bound together by the ties of brotherhood , and common interest , and perils ! live forever — one and undivided ! — Lyman Beecher .</p>
   <p>LX . RIDING ON A SNOWPLOW . ( 231 )</p>
   <p>Benjamin Franklin Taylor , 1822-1887 , was born at Lowville , New York , and graduated at Madison University , of which his father was president . Here he remained as resident graduate for about five years . His “ Attractions of Language ” was published in 1845 . For many years Mr. Taylor was literary editor of the “ Chicago Journal . ” He wrote considerably for the magazines , and was the author of many well-known fugitive pieces , both in prose and verse . He also published several books , of which “ January and June , ” “ Pictures in Camp and Field , ” “ The World on Wheels , ” “ Old-time Pictures and Sheaves of Rhyme , ” “ Between the Gates , ” and “ Songs of Yesterday , ” are the best known . In his later years , Mr. Taylor achieved some reputation as a lecturer . His writings are marked by an exuberant fancy . ###</p>

Not the pet and pony of a thing that is attached to the front of an engine , sometimes , like a pilot ; but a great two-storied monster of strong timbers , that runs upon wheels of its own , and that boys run after and stare at as they would after and at an elephant . You are snow-bound at Buffalo . The Lake Shore Line is piled with drifts like a surf . Two passenger trains have been half-buried for twelve hours somewhere in snowy Chautauqua . The storm howls like a congregation of Arctic bears . But the superintendent at Buffalo is determined to release his castaways , and clear the road to Erie . He permits you to be a passenger on the great snowplow ; and there it is , all ready to drive . Harnessed behind it , is a tandem team of three engines . It does not occur to you that you are going to ride on a steam drill , and so you get aboard .</p>
   <p>It is a spacious and timbered room , with one large bull 's eye window ,— an overgrown lens . The thing is a sort of Cyclops . There are ropes , and chains , and a windlass . There is a bell by which the engineer of the first engine can signal the plowman , and a cord whereby the plowman can talk back . There are two sweeps , or arms , worked by machinery , on the sides . You ask their use , and the superintendent replies , “ When , in a violent shock , there is danger of the monster 's upsetting , an arm is put out , on one side or the other , to keep the thing from turning a complete somersault . ” You get one idea , and an inkling of another . So you take out your Accident Policy for three thousand dollars , and examine it . It never mentions battles , nor duels , nor snowplows . It names “ public conveyances . ” Is a snowplow a public conveyance ? You are inclined to think it is neither that nor any other kind that you should trust yourself to , but it is too late for consideration .</p>
   <p>You roll out of Buffalo in the teeth of the wind , and the world is turned to snow . All goes merrily . The machine strikes little drifts , and they scurry away in a cloud . The three engines breathe easily ; but by and by the earth seems broken into great billows of dazzling white . The sun comes out of a cloud , and touches it up till it out-silvers Potosi . Houses lie in the trough of the sea everywhere , and it requires little imagination to think they are pitching and tossing before your eyes . A great breaker rises right in the way . The monster , with you in it , works its way up and feels of it . It is packed like a ledge of marble . Three whistles ! The machine backs away and keeps backing , as a gymnast runs astern to get sea room and momentum for a big jump ; as a giant swings aloft a heavy sledge , that it may come down with a heavy blow .</p>
   <p>One whistle ! You have come to a halt . Three pairs of whistles one after the other ! and then , putting on all steam , you make for the drift . The superintendent locks the door , you do not quite understand why , and in a second the battle begins . The machine rocks and creaks in all its joints . There comes a tremendous shock . The cabin is as dark as midnight . The clouds of flying snow put out the day . The labored breathing of the locomotives behind you , the clouds of smoke and steam that wrap you up as in a mantle , the noonday eclipse of the sun , the surging of the ship , the rattling of chains , the creak of timbers as if the craft were aground and the sea getting out of its bed to whelm you altogether , the doubt as to what will come ,— all combine to make a scene of strange excitement for a landlubber .</p>
   <p>You have made some impression on the breaker , and again the machine backs for a fair start , and then another plunge , and shock , and twilight . And so , from deep cut to deep cut , as if the season had packed all his winter clothes upon the track , until the stalled trains are reached and passed ; and then , with alternate storm and calm , and halt and shock , till the way is cleared to Erie .</p>
   <p>It is Sunday afternoon , and Erie — “ Mad Anthony Wayne 's ” old headquarters — has donned its Sunday clothes , and turned out by hundreds to see the great plow come in ,— its first voyage over the line . The locomotives set up a crazy scream , and you draw slowly into the depot . The door opened at last , you clamber down , and gaze up at the uneasy house in which you have been living . It looks as if an avalanche had tumbled down upon it ,— white as an Alpine shoulder . Your first thought is gratitude that you have made a landing alive . Your second , a resolution that , if again you ride a hammer , it will not be when three engines have hold of the handle !</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Chautauqua is the most western county in the state of New York ; it borders on Lake Erie .</p>
   <p>The Cyclops are described in Grecian mythology as giants having only one eye , which was circular , and placed in the middle of the forehead .</p>
   <p>Cerro de Potosi is a mountain in Bolivia , South America , celebrated for its mineral wealth . More than five thousand mines have been opened in it ; the product is chiefly silver .</p>
   <p>“ Mad Anthony Wayne ” ( b . 1745 , d. 1796 ) , so called from his bravery and apparent recklessness , was a famous American officer during the Revolution . In 1794 be conducted a successful campaign against the Indians of the Northwest , making his headquarters at Erie , Pa .</p>

    <head>LXI . THE QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS . ( 234 )</head>
     <l n="1">Cas . That you have wronged me doth appear in this :</l>
     <l n="2">You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella</l>
     <l n="3">For taking bribes here of the Sardians ;</l>
     <l n="4">Wherein my letters , praying on his side ,</l>
     <l n="5">Because I knew the man , were slighted off .</l>
     <l n="6">Bru . You wronged yourself to write in such a case .</l>
     <l n="7">Cas . In such a time as this , it is not meet</l>
     <l n="8">That every nice offense should bear his comment .</l>
     <l n="9">Bru . Yet let me tell you , Cassius , you yourself</l>
     <l n="10">Are much condemned to have an itching palm ,</l>
     <l n="11">To sell and mart your offices for gold</l>
     <l n="12">To undeservers .</l>
     <l n="13">Cas . I an itching palm !</l>
     <l n="14">You know that you are Brutus that speak this ,</l>
     <l n="15">Or , by the gods , this speech were else your last .</l>
     <l n="16">Bru . The name of Cassius honors this corruption ,</l>
     <l n="17">And chastisement doth therefore hide his head .</l>
     <l n="18">Cas . Chastisement !</l>
     <l n="19">Bru . Remember March , the ides of March remember !</l>
     <l n="20">Did not great Julius bleed for justice ’ sake ?</l>
     <l n="21">What villain touched his body , that did stab ,</l>
     <l n="22">And not for justice ? What ! shall one of us ,</l>
     <l n="23">That struck the foremost man of all this world</l>
     <l n="24">But for supporting robbers ; shall we now</l>
     <l n="25">Contaminate our fingers with base bribes ,</l>
     <l n="26">And sell the mighty space of our large honors</l>
     <l n="27">For so much trash as may be graspe 'd thus ?</l>
     <l n="28">I had rather be a dog , and bay the moon ,</l>
     <l n="29">Than such a Roman .</l>
     <l n="30">Cas . Brutus , bay not me ;</l>
     <l n="31">I 'll not endure it : you forget yourself ,</l>
     <l n="32">To hedge me in ; I am a soldier , I ,</l>
     <l n="33">Older in practice , abler than yourself</l>
     <l n="34">To make conditions .</l>
     <l n="35">Bru . Go to ; you are not , Cassius .</l>
     <l n="36">Cas . I am .</l>
     <l n="37">Bru . I say you are not .</l>
     <l n="38">Cas . Urge me no more , I shall forget myself :</l>
     <l n="39">Have mind upon your health ; tempt me no further .</l>
     <l n="40">Bru . Away , slight man !</l>
     <l n="41">Cas . Is't possible ?</l>
     <l n="42">Bru . Hear me , for I will speak .</l>
     <l n="43">Must I give way and room to your rash choler ?</l>
     <l n="44">Shall I be frighted when a madman stares ?</l>
     <l n="45">Cas . O ye gods ! ye gods ! must I endure all this ?</l>
     <l n="46">Bru . All this ! Ay , more : fret till your proud heart break ;</l>
     <l n="47">Go , show your slaves how choleric you are ,</l>
     <l n="48">And make your bondmen tremble . Must I budge ?</l>
     <l n="49">Must I observe you ? Must I stand and crouch</l>
     <l n="50">Under your testy humor ? By the gods ,</l>
     <l n="51">You shall digest the venom of your spleen ,</l>
     <l n="52">Though it do split you ; for , from this day forth ,</l>
     <l n="53">I 'll use you for my mirth , yea for my laughter ,</l>
     <l n="54">When you are waspish .</l>
     <l n="55">Cas . Is it come to this ?</l>
     <l n="56">Bru . You say you are a better soldier ;</l>
     <l n="57">Let it appear so ; make your vaunting true ,</l>
     <l n="58">And it shall please me well : for mine own part ,</l>
     <l n="59">I shall be glad to learn of noble men .</l>
     <l n="60">Cas . You wrong me every way ; you wrong me , Brutus ;</l>
     <l n="61">I said , an elder soldier , not a better :</l>
     <l n="62">Did I say “ better ” ?</l>
     <l n="63">Bru . If you did , I care not .</l>
     <l n="64">Cas . When Caesar lived , he durst not thus have moved me .</l>
     <l n="65">Bru . Peace , peace ! you durst not so have tempted him .</l>
     <l n="66">Cas . I durst not ?</l>
     <l n="67">Bru . No .</l>
     <l n="68">Cas . What ! durst not tempt him ?</l>
     <l n="69">Bru . For your life , you durst not .</l>
     <l n="70">Cas . Do not presume too much upon my love ;</l>
     <l n="71">I may do that I shall be sorry for .</l>
     <l n="72">Bru . You have done that you should be sorry for .</l>
     <l n="73">There is no terror , Cassius , in your threats ;</l>
     <l n="74">For I am armed so strong in honesty</l>
     <l n="75">That they pass by me as the idle wind ,</l>
     <l n="76">Which I respect not . I did send to you</l>
     <l n="77">For certain sums of gold , which you denied me ;—</l>
     <l n="78">For I can raise no money by vile means :</l>
     <l n="79">By heaven ! I had rather coin my heart ,</l>
     <l n="80">And drop my blood for drachmas , than to wring</l>
     <l n="81">From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</l>
     <l n="82">By any indirection .— I did send</l>
     <l n="83">To you for gold to pay my legions ,</l>
     <l n="84">Which you denied me : was that done like Cassius ?</l>
     <l n="85">Should I have answered Caius Cassius so ?</l>
     <l n="86">When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous ,</l>
     <l n="87">To lock such rascal counters from his friends ,</l>
     <l n="88">Be ready , gods , with an your thunderbolts ;</l>
     <l n="89">Dash him to pieces !</l>
     <l n="90">Cas . I denied you not .</l>
     <l n="91">Bru . You did .</l>
     <l n="92">Cas . I did not : he was but a fool that brought</l>
     <l n="93">My answer back . Brutus hath rived my heart :</l>
     <l n="94">A friend should bear his friend 's infirmities ,</l>
     <l n="95">But Brutus makes mine greater than they are .</l>
     <l n="96">Bru . I do not , till you practice them on me .</l>
     <l n="97">Cas . You love me not .</l>
     <l n="98">Bru . I do not like your faults .</l>
     <l n="99">Cas . A friendly eye could never see such faults .</l>
     <l n="100">Bru . A flatterer 's would not , though they do appear</l>
     <l n="101">As huge as high Olympus .</l>
     <l n="102">Cas . Come , Antony , and young Octavius , come ,</l>
     <l n="103">Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius ,</l>
     <l n="104">For Cassius is aweary of the world ;</l>
     <l n="105">Hated by one he loves ; braved by his brother ;</l>
     <l n="106">Checked like a bondman ; all his faults observed ,</l>
     <l n="107">Set in a notebook , learned , and conned by rate ,</l>
     <l n="108">To cast into my teeth . Oh , I could weep</l>
     <l n="109">My spirit from mine eyes ! There is my dagger ,</l>
     <l n="110">And here my naked breast ; within , a heart</l>
     <l n="111">Dearer than Plutus ’ mine , richer than gold :</l>
     <l n="112">If that thou be'st a Roman , take it forth :</l>
     <l n="113">I , that denied thee gold , will give my heart :</l>
     <l n="114">Strike , as thou didst at Caesar ; for , I know ,</l>
     <l n="115">When thou didst hate him worst , thou lovedst him better</l>
     <l n="116">Than ever thou lovedst Cassius .</l>
     <l n="117">Bru . Sheathe your dagger :</l>
     <l n="118">Be angry when you will , it shall have scope ;</l>
     <l n="119">Do what you will , dishonor shall be humor .</l>
     <l n="120">O Cassius , you are yoked with a lamb</l>
     <l n="121">That carries anger as the flint bears fire ;</l>
     <l n="122">Who , much enforced , shows a hasty spark ,</l>
     <l n="123">And straight is cold again .</l>
     <l n="124">Cas . Hath Cassius lived</l>
     <l n="125">To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus ,</l>
     <l n="126">When grief , and blood ill-tempered , vexeth him ?</l>
     <l n="127">Bru . When I spoke that , I was ill-tempered , too .</l>
     <l n="128">Cas . Do you confess so much ? Give me your hand .</l>

   <p>Pandora is described in the Greek legends as the first created woman . She was sent by Jupiter to Epimetheus as a punishment , because the latter 's brother , Prometheus , had stolen fire from heaven . When she arrived among men , she opened a box in which were all the evils of mankind , and everything escaped except Hope .</p>
   <p>LXIII . RIP VAN WINKLE . ( 242 )</p>
   <p>The appearance of Rip , with his long , grizzled beard , his rusty fowling piece , his uncouth dress , and an army of women and children at his heels , soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians . They crowded around him , eying him from head to foot with great curiosity . The orator bustled up to him , and , drawing him partly aside , inquired on which side he voted . Rip stared in vacant stupidity . Another short but busy little fellow pulled him by the arm , and , rising on tiptoe , inquired in his ear “ whether he was Federal or Democrat . ”</p>
   <p>Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question ; when a knowing , self-important old gentleman , in a sharp cocked hat , made his way through the crowd , putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he passed , and planting himself before Van Winkle , with one arm akimbo , the other resting on his cane , his keen eyes and sharp hat , penetrating , as it were , into his very soul , demanded , in an austere tone , what brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder , and a mob at his heels , and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village .</p>
   <p>“ Alas ! gentlemen , ” cried Rip , somewhat dismayed , “ I am a poor , quiet man , a native of the place , and a loyal subject of the king , God bless him ! ” Here a general shout burst from the bystanders .— “ A tory ! a tory ! a spy ! a refugee ! hustle him ! away with him ! ” It was with great difficulty that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order ; and , having a tenfold austerity of brow , demanded again of the unknown culprit , what he came there for , and whom he was seeking . The poor man humbly assured him that he meant no harm , but merely came there in search of some of his neighbors , who used to keep about the tavern . “ Well , who are they ? name them . ”</p>
   <p>Rip bethought himself a moment , and inquired , “ Where 's Nicholas Vedder ? ” There was a silence for a little while , when an old man replied , in a thin , piping voice , “ Nicholas Vedder ! why he is dead and gone these eighteen years ! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used to tell all about him , but that 's rotten and gone too . ” “ Where 's Brom Dutcher ? ” “ Oh , he went off to the army in the beginning of the war . Some say he was killed at the storming of Stony Point ; others say he was drowned in a squall at the foot of Anthony 's Nose . I do n't know ; he never came back again . ”</p>
   <p>“ Where 's Van Bummel , the schoolmaster ? ” “ He went off to the wars , too ; was a great militia general , and is now in Congress . ” Rip 's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home and friends , and finding himself thus alone in the world . Every answer puzzled him , too , by treating of such enormous lapses of time , and of matters which he could not understand — war , Congress , Stony Point . He had no courage to ask after any more friends , but cried out in despair , “ Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Oh , Rip Van Winkle ! ” exclaimed two or three . “ Oh , to be sure ! That 's Rip Van Winkle yonder , leaning against the tree . ” Rip looked , and beheld a precise counterpart of himself as he went up the mountain ; apparently as lazy , and certainly as ragged . The poor fellow was now completely confounded ; he doubted his own identity , and whether he was himself or another man . In the midst of his bewilderment , the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was , and what was his name .</p>
   <p>“ God knows ! ” exclaimed he , at his wit 's end . “ I 'm not myself ; I 'm somebody else ; that 's me yonder ; no , that 's somebody else got into my shoes . I was myself last night ; but I fell asleep on the mountain , and they 've changed my gun , and everything 's changed , and I 'm changed , and I can n't tell what 's my name or who I am ! ”</p>
   <p>The bystanders began now to look at each other , nod , wink significantly , and tap their fingers against their foreheads . There was a whisper , also , about securing the gun , and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief , at the very suggestion of which the self-important man in the cocked hat retired with some precipitation . At this critical moment , a fresh , comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man . She had a chubby child in her arms , which , frightened at his looks , began to cry . “ Hush , Rip ! ” cried she , “ hush , you little fool ! the old man wo n't hurt you . ”</p>
   <p>The name of the child , the air of the mother , the tone of her voice , all awakened a train of recollections in his mind . “ What is your name , my good woman ? ” asked he . “ Judith Gardenier . ” “ And your father 's name ? ” “ Ah , poor man ! Rip Van Winkle was his name ; but it 's twenty years since he went away from home with his gun , and never has been heard of since ; his dog came home without him ; but whether he shot himself , or was carried away by the Indians , nobody can tell . I was then but a little girl . ”</p>
   <p>Rip had but one question more to ask ; but he put it with a faltering voice : “ Where 's your mother ? ” “ Oh , she , too , died but a short time since ; she broke a blood vessel in a fit of passion at a New England peddler . ” There was a drop of comfort , at least , in this intelligence . The honest man could contain himself no longer . He caught his daughter and her child in his arms . “ I am your father ! ” cried he . “ Young Rip Van Winkle once , old Rip Van Winkle now ! Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle ? ”</p>
   <p>All stood amazed , until an old woman , tottering out from among the crowd , put her hand to her brow , and , peering under it in his face for a moment , exclaimed , “ Sure enough ! it is Rip Van Winkle ! it is himself ! Welcome home again , old neighbor ! Why , where have you been these twenty long years ? ” Rip 's story was soon told , for the whole twenty years had been to him but as one night .</p>
   <p>To make a long story short , the company broke up and returned to the more important concerns of the election . Rip 's daughter took him home to live with her . She had a snug , well-furnished house , and a stout , cheery farmer for a husband , whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that used to climb upon his back . Rip now resumed his old walks and habits . He soon found many of his former cronies , though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of time , and preferred making friends among the rising generation , with whom he soon grew into great favor . — Irving .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Rip Van Winkle , according to Irving 's story in “ The Sketch Book , ” was a great drunkard , and was driven from his home in the Catskill Mountains , one night , by his wife . Wandering among the mountains , he fell in with the ghosts of Hendrick Hudson and his crew , with whom he played a game of ninepins . Upon drinking the liquor which they offered him , however , he immediately fell into a deep sleep which lasted for twenty years . The above lesson recounts the events that befell him when he returned to his native village . In the meantime the Revolution of 1776 had taken place .</p>
   <p>The Federals and the Democrats formed the two leading political parties of that time .</p>
   <p>Stony Point is a promontory on the Hudson , at the entrance of the Highlands , forty-two miles from New York . It was a fortified post during the Revolution , captured by the British , and again retaken by the Americans under Wayne . Anthony 's Nose is also a promontory on the Hudson , about fifteen miles above Stony Point .</p>

    <head>Oliver Wendell Holmes , 1809-1894 , was the son of Abiel Holmes , D. D . He was born in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and graduated at Harvard in 1829 , having for classmates several men who have since become distinguished . After graduating , he studied law for about one year , and then turned his attention to medicine . He studied his profession in Paris , and elsewhere in Europe , and took his degree at Cambridge in 1836 . In 1838 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in Dartmouth College . He remained here but a short time , and then returned to Boston and entered on the practice of medicine . In 1847 he was appointed professor at Harvard , filling a similar position to the one held at Dartmouth . He discharged the duties of his professorship for more than thirty years , with great success . Literature was never his profession ; yet few American authors attained higher success , both as a poet and as a prose writer . His poems are lively and sparkling , abound in wit and humor , but are not wanting in genuine pathos . Many of them were composed for special occasions . His prose writings include works on medicine , essays , and novels ; several appeared first as contributions to the “ Atlantic Monthly . ” He gained reputation , also , as it popular lecturer . In person , Dr. Holmes was small and active , with a face expressive of thought and vivacity . ###</head>

   <p>LXV . SORROW FOR THE DEAD . ( 249 )</p>
   <p>The sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be divorced . Every other wound we seek to heal ; every other affliction , to forget ; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open . This affliction we cherish , and brood over in solitude . Where is the mother who would willingly forget the infant that has perished like a blossom from her arms , though every recollection is a pang ? Where is the child that would willingly forget a tender parent , though to remember be but to lament ? Who , even in the hour of agony , would forget the friend over whom he mourns ?</p>
   <p>No , the love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes of the soul . If it has its woes , it has likewise its delights : and when the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear of recollection ; when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over the present ruins of all that we most loved , is softened away into pensive meditation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness , who would root out such a sorrow from the heart ? Though it may , sometimes , throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of gayety , or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom ; yet , who would exchange it even for the song of pleasure , or the burst of revelry ? No , there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song . There is a remembrance of the dead , to which we turn even from the charms of the living .</p>
   <p>Oh , the grave ! the grave ! It buries every error , covers every defect , extinguishes every resentment ! From its peaceful bosom spring none but fond regrets and tender recollections . Who can look down upon the grave even of an enemy , and not feel a compunctious throb , that he should have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies moldering before him ? But the grave of those we loved — what a place for meditation ! There it is that we call up , in long review , the whole history of virtue and gentleness , and the thousand endearments lavished upon us , almost unheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy ; there it is that we dwell upon the tenderness , the solemn , awful tenderness of the parting scene ; the bed of death , with all its stifled griefs , its noiseless attendance , its mute , watchful assiduities ! the last testimonies of expiring love ! the feeble , fluttering , thrilling ,— oh ! how thrilling !— pressure of the hand ! the last fond look of the glazing eye turning upon us , even from the threshold of existence ! the faint , faltering accents , struggling in death to give one more assurance of affection !</p>
   <p>Ay , go to the grave of buried love , and meditate ! There settle the account with thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited ; every past endearment unregarded , of that departed being , who can never — never — never return to be soothed by thy contrition ! If thou art a child , and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul , or a furrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent ; if thou art a husband , and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth ; if thou art a friend , and hast ever wronged , in thought , or word , or deed , the spirit that generously confided in thee ; if thou hast given one unmerited pang to that true heart , which now lies cold and still beneath thy feet ; then be sure that every unkind look , every ungracious word , every ungentle action , will come thronging back upon thy memory , and knocking dolefully at thy soul ; then be sure that thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the grave , and utter the unheard groan , and pour the unavailing tear ; more deep , more bitter , because unheard and unavailing .</p>
   <p>Then weave thy chaplet of flowers , and strew the beauties of nature about the grave ; console thy broken spirit , if thou canst , with these tender , yet futile , tributes of regret : but take warning by the bitterness of this , thy contrite affliction over the dead , and henceforth be more faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living . — Irving .</p>

He was admitted to the practice of medicine in 1820 , and went to Charleston , South Carolina . In 1824 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at West Point , a position which he held but a few months . In 1854 he was appointed State Geologist of Wisconsin , and died at Hazel Green , in that state . Dr. Percival was eminent as a geographer , geologist , and linguist . He began to write poetry at an early age , and his fame rests chiefly upon his writings in this department . In his private life , Percival was always shy , modest , and somewhat given to melancholy . Financially , his life was one of struggle , and he was often greatly straitened for money . ###</head>

   <p>LXVII . POLITICAL TOLERATION . ( 253 )</p>
   <p>Thomas Jefferson , 1743-1826 , the third President of the United States , and the author of the Declaration of Independence , was born in Albemarle County , Virginia . He received most of his early education under private tutors , and at the age of seventeen entered William and Mary College , where he remained two years . At college , where he studied industriously , he formed the acquaintance of several distinguished men , among them was George Wythe , with whom he entered on the study of law . At the age of twenty-four he was admitted to the bar , and soon rose to high standing in his profession . In 1775 he entered the Colonial Congress , having previously served ably in the legislature of his native state . Although one of the youngest men in Congress , he soon took a foremost place in that body . He left Congress in the fall of 1776 , and , as a member of the legislature , and later as Governor of Virginia , he was chiefly instrumental in effecting several important reforms in the laws of that state ,— the most notable were the abolition of the law of primogeniture , and the passage of a law making all religious denominations equal . From 1785 to 1789 he was Minister to France . On his return to America he was made Secretary of State , in the first Cabinet . While in this office , he became the leader of the Republican or Anti-Federalist party , in opposition to the Federalist party led by Alexander Hamilton . From 1801 to 1809 he was President . On leaving his high office , he retired to his estate at “ Monticello , ” where he passed the closing years of his life , and died on the 4th of July , just fifty years after the passage of his famous Declaration . His compatriot , and sometimes bitter political opponent , John Adams , died on the same day .</p>
   <p>Mr. Jefferson , who was never a ready public speaker , was a remarkably clear and forcible writer ; his works fill several large volumes . In personal character , he was pure and simple , cheerful , and disposed to look on the bright side . His knowledge of life rendered his conversation highly attractive . The chief enterprise of his later years was the founding of the University of Virginia , at Charlottesville . ###</p>
   <p>During the contest of opinion through which we have passed , the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers , unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think ; but this being now decided by the voice of the nation , announced according to the rules of the constitution , all will , of course , arrange themselves under the will of the law , and unite in common efforts for the common good .</p>
   <p>All , too , will bear in mind this sacred principle , that , though the will of the majority is , in all cases , to prevail , that will , to be rightful , must be reasonable ; that the minority possess their equal rights , which equal laws must protect , and to violate which would be oppression . Let us then , fellow-citizens , unite with one heart and one mind .</p>
   <p>Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection , without which liberty , and even life itself , are but dreary things ; and let us reflect , that , having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered , we have gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic , as wicked , and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions .</p>
   <p>During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world ; during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man , seeking , through blood and slaughter , his long-lost liberty ; it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore ; that this should be more felt and feared by some , and less by others , and should divide opinions as to measures of safety .</p>
   <p>But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle . We have called by different names brethren of the same principle . We are all Republicans ; we are all Federalists . If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union , or to change its republican form , let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated when reason is left free to combat it .</p>
   <p>I know , indeed , that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong ; that this government is not strong enough . But would the honest patriot , in the full tide of successful experiment , abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm , on the theoretic and visionary fear that this government , the world 's best hope , may , by possibility , want energy to preserve itself ? I trust not ; I believe this , on the contrary , the strongest government on earth .</p>
   <p>I believe it to be the only one where every man , at the call of the law , would fly to the standard of the law , and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern . Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself . Can he , then , be trusted with the government of others , or have we found angels , in the form of kings , to govern him ? Let history answer this question . Let us , then , with courage and confidence , pursue our own federal and republican principles ; our attachment to union and representative government .</p>
   <p>NOTE .— At the time of Jefferson 's election , party spirit ran very high . He had been defeated by John Adams at the previous presidential election , but the Federal party , to which Adams belonged , became weakened by their management during difficulties with France ; and now Jefferson had been elected president over his formerly successful rival . The above selection is from his inaugural address .</p>

   <p>LXX . SOUTH CAROLINA . ( 257 )</p>
   <p>Robert Young Hayne , 1791-1840 , was born in Colleton District , South Carolina , and studied and practiced law at Charleston . He was early elected to the State Legislature , and became Speaker of the House and Attorney-general of the state . He entered the Senate of the United States at the age of thirty-one . He was Governor of South Carolina during the “ Nullification ” troubles in 1832 and 1833 . Mr. Hayne was a clear and able debater , and a stanch advocate of the extreme doctrine of “ State Rights . ” In the Senate he opposed the Tariff Bill of 1828 ; and , out of this struggle , grew his famous debate with Daniel Webster in 1830 . The following selection is an extract from Mr. Hayne 's speech on that memorable occasion . ###</p>
   <p>If there be one state in the Union , Mr. President , that may challenge comparison with any other , for a uniform , zealous , ardent , and uncalculating devotion to the Union , that state is South Carolina . Sir , from the very commencement of the Revolution , up to this hour , there is no sacrifice , however great , she has not cheerfully made ; no service she has ever hesitated to perform .</p>
   <p>She has adhered to you in your prosperity ; but in your adversity she has clung to you with more than filial affection . No matter what was the condition of her domestic affairs ; though deprived of her resources , divided by parties , or surrounded by difficulties , the call of the country has been to her as the voice of God . Domestic discord ceased at the sound ; every man became at once reconciled to his brethren , and the sons of Carolina were all seen , crowding to the temple , bringing their gifts to the altar of their common country .</p>
   <p>What , sir , was the conduct of the South , during the Revolution ? Sir , I honor New England for her conduct in that glorious struggle . But great as is the praise which belongs to her , I think at least equal honor is due to the South . Never were there exhibited , in the history of the world , higher examples of noble daring , dreadful suffering , and heroic endurance , than by the whigs of Carolina , during the Revolution . The whole state , from the mountains to the sea , was overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy . The fruits of industry perished on the spot where they were produced , or were consumed by the foe .</p>
   <p>The plains of Carolina drank up the most precious blood of her citizens . Black , smoking ruins marked the places which had been the habitation of her children . Driven from their homes into the gloomy and almost impenetrable swamps , even there the spirit of liberty survived , and South Carolina , sustained by the example of her Sumters and her Marions , proved , by her conduct , that though her soil might be overrun , the spirit of her people was invincible .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Thomas Sumter ( b . 1734 , d. 1832 ) was by birth a Virginian , but during the Revolution commanded South Carolina troops . He was one of the most active and able of the Southern generals , and , after the war , was prominent in politics . He was the last surviving general of the Revolution .</p>
   <p>Francis Marion ( b . 1732 , d. 1795 ) , known as the “ Swamp Fox , ” was a native South Carolinian , of French descent . Marion 's brigade became noted during the Revolution for its daring and surprising attacks . See Lesson CXXXV .</p>
   <p>LXXI . MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTH CAROLINA . ( 259 )</p>
   <p>Daniel Webster , 1782-1852 . This celebrated American statesman and orator was born in Salisbury , New Hampshire . His father , Ebenezer Webster , was a pioneer settler , a soldier in the Old French War and the Revolution , and a man of ability and strict integrity , Daniel attended the common school in his youth , and fitted for college under Rev . Samuel Wood , of Boseawen , graduating at Dartmouth in 1801 . He spent a few months of his boyhood at “ Phillips Academy , ” Exeter , where he attained distinction as a student , but was so diffident that he could never give a declamation before his class . During his college course , and later , he taught school several terms in order to increase his slender finances . He was admitted to the bar in Boston in 1805 . For the next eleven years , he practiced his profession in his native state . In 1812 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives , and at once took his place as one of the most prominent men of that body . In 1816 he removed to Boston ; and in 1827 he was elected to the United States Senate , where he continued for twelve years . In 1841 he was made Secretary of State , and soon after negotiated the famous “ Ashburton Treaty ” with England , settling the northern boundary of the United States . In 1845 he returned to the Senate ; and in 1850 he was re-appointed Secretary of State , and continued in office till his death . He died at his country residence in Marshfield , Massachusetts .</p>
   <p>Mr. Webster 's fame rests chiefly on his state papers and his speeches in Congress ; but he took a prominent part in some of the most famous law cases of the present century . Several of his public addresses on occasional themes are well known , also . As a speaker , he was dignified and stately , using clear , straightforward , pure English . He had none of the tricks of oratory . He was large of person , with a massive head , a swarthy complexion , and deep-set , keen , and lustrous eyes . His grand presence added much to his power as a speaker . ###</p>
   <p>The eulogium pronounced on the character of the State of South Carolina by the honorable gentleman , for her Revolutionary and other merits , meets my hearty concurrence . I shall not acknowledge that the honorable member goes before me , in regard for whatever of distinguished talent or distinguished character South Carolina has produced . I claim part of the honor ; I partake in the pride of her great names . I claim them for countrymen , one and all — the Laurenses , the Rutledges , the Pinckneys , the Sumters , the Marions — Americans all — whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by state lines than their talents and patriotism were capable of being circumscribed within the same narrow limits .</p>
   <p>In their day and generation , they served and honored the country , and the whole country , and their renown is of the treasures of the whole country . Him whose honored name the gentleman himself bears ,— does he suppose me less capable of gratitude for his patriotism , or sympathy for his suffering , than if his eyes had first opened upon the light in Massachusetts , instead of South Carolina ? Sir , does he suppose it in his power to exhibit in Carolina a name so bright as to produce envy in my bosom ? No , sir ,— increased gratification and delight rather . Sir , I thank God that , if I am gifted with little of the spirit which is said to be able to raise mortals to the skies , I have yet none , as I trust , of that other spirit which would drag angels down .</p>
   <p>When I shall be found , sir , in my place here in the Senate , or elsewhere , to sneer at public merit because it happened to spring up beyond the little limits of my own state or neighborhood ; when I refuse for any such cause , or for any cause , the homage due to American talent , to elevated patriotism , to sincere devotion to liberty and the country ; or if I see an uncommon endowment of Heaven ; if I see extraordinary capacity or virtue in any son of the South ; and if , moved by local prejudice , or gangrened by state jealousy , I get up here to abate a tithe of a hair from his just character and just fame , may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth !</p>
   <p>Mr. President , I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts . She needs none . There she is ; behold her , and judge for yourselves . There is her history ; the world knows it by heart . The past , at least , is secure . There is Boston , and Concord , and Lexington , and Bunker Hill ; and there they will remain forever . And , sir , where American Liberty raised its first voice , and where its youth was nurtured and sustained , there it still lives , in the strength of its manhood , and full of its original spirit . If discord and disunion shall wound it ; if party strife and blind ambition shall hawk at and tear it ; if folly and madness , if uneasiness under salutary restraint , shall succeed to separate it from that Union , by which alone its existence is made sure , it will stand , in the end , by the side of that cradle in which its infancy was rocked ; it will stretch forth its arm , with whatever of vigor it may still retain , over the friends who gathered around it ; and it will fall at last , if fall it must , amid the proudest monuments of its glory and on the very spot of its origin .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— The Laurenses were of French descent . Henry Laurens was appointed on the commission with Franklin and Jay to negotiate the treaty of peace at Paris at the close of the Revolution . His son , John Laurens , was an aid and secretary of Washington , who was greatly attached to him .</p>
   <p>The Rutledges were of Irish descent . John Rutledge was a celebrated statesman and lawyer . He was appointed Chief Justice of the United States , but the Senate , for political reasons , refused to confirm his appointment .</p>
   <p>Edward Rutledge , brother of the preceding , was Governor of South Carolina during the last two years of his life .</p>
   <p>The Pinckneys were an old English family who emigrated to Charleston in 1687 . Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and his brother Thomas were both active participants in the Revolution . The former was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidency of the United States , in 1800 .</p>
   <p>Thomas was elected governor of South Carolina in 1789 . In the war of 1812 he served as major-general .</p>
   <p>Charles Pinckney , a second cousin of the two already mentioned , was four times elected governor of his state .</p>
   <p>LXXII . THE CHURCH SCENE FROM EVANGELINE . ( 262 )</p>
   <p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow , 1807-1882 , the son of Hon . Stephen Longfellow , an eminent lawyer of Portland , Maine , was born in that city . He graduated , at the age of eighteen , at Bowdoin College . He was soon appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Literature in that institution , and , to fit himself further for his work , he went abroad and spent four years in Europe . He remained at Bowdoin till 1835 , when he was appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in Harvard University . On receiving this appointment , he again went to Europe and remained two years . He resigned his professorship in 1854 , and after that time resided in Cambridge , pursuing his literary labors and giving to the public , from time to time , the fruits of his pen . In 1868 he made a voyage to England , where he was received with extraordinary marks of honor and esteem . In addition to Mr. Longfellow 's original works , both in poetry and in prose , he distinguished himself by several translations ; the most famous is that of the works of Dante .</p>
   <p>Mr. Longfellow 's poetry is always elegant and chaste , showing in every line traces of his careful scholarship . Yet it is not above the popular taste or comprehension , as is shown by the numerous and varied editions of his poems . Many of his poems treat of historical themes ; “ Evangeline , ” from which the following selection is taken , is esteemed by many as the most beautiful of all his longer poems ; it was first published in 1847 . ###</p>

     <l n="1">So passed the morning away . And lo ! with a summons sonorous</l>
     <l n="2">Sounded the bell from its tower , and over the meadows a drumbeat .</l>
     <l n="3">Thronged erelong was the church with men . Without , in the churchyard ,</l>
     <l n="4">Awaited the women . They stood by the graves , and hung on the headstones</l>
     <l n="5">Garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest .</l>

     <l n="9">Echoed a moment only , and slowly the ponderous portal</l>
     <l n="10">Closed , and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="11">Then uprose their commander , and spake from the steps of the altar ,</l>

     <l n="13">“ You have convened this day , ” he said , “ by his Majesty 's orders .</l>
     <l n="14">Clement and kind has he been ; but how you have answered his kindness ,</l>
     <l n="15">Let your own hearts reply ! To my natural make and my temper</l>
     <l n="16">Painful the task is I do , which to you I know must be grievous .</l>
     <l n="17">Yet must I bow and obey , and deliver the will of our monarch ;</l>
     <l n="18">Namely , that all your lands , and dwellings , and cattle of all kinds</l>
     <l n="19">Forfeited be to the crown ; and that you yourselves from this province</l>
     <l n="20">Be transported to other lands . God grant you may dwell there</l>
     <l n="21">Ever as faithful subjects , a happy and peaceable people !</l>
     <l n="22">Prisoners now I declare you ; for such is his Majesty 's pleasure ! ”</l>

     <l n="23">As , when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer ,</l>
     <l n="24">Suddenly gathers a storm , and the deadly sling of the hailstones</l>
     <l n="25">Beats down the farmer 's corn in the field and shatters his windows ,</l>
     <l n="26">Hiding the sun , and strewing the ground with thatch from the house roofs ,</l>
     <l n="27">Bellowing fly the herds , and seek to break their inclosure ;</l>
     <l n="28">So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker .</l>
     <l n="29">Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder , and then rose</l>
     <l n="30">Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger ,</l>
     <l n="31">And , by one impulse moved , they madly rushed to the doorway .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="32">Vain was the hope of escape ; and cries and fierce imprecations</l>
     <l n="33">Rang through the house of prayer ; and high o'er the heads of the others</l>
     <l n="34">Rose , with his arms uplifted , the figure of Basil the blacksmith ,</l>
     <l n="35">As , on a stormy sea , a spar is tossed by the billows .</l>
     <l n="36">Flushed was his face and distorted with passion ; and wildly he shouted ,—</l>
     <l n="37">“ Down with the tyrants of England ! we never have sworn them allegiance !</l>
     <l n="38">Death to these foreign soldiers , who seize on our homes and our harvests ! ”</l>
     <l n="39">More he fain would have said , but the merciless hand of a soldier</l>

   <p>NOTE .— Nova Scotia was first settled by the French , but , in 1713 , was ceded to the English . The inhabitants refusing either to take the oath of allegiance or to bear arms against their fellow-countrymen in the French and Indian War , it was decided to remove the whole people , and distribute them among the other British provinces . This was accordingly done in 1755 . The villages were burned to the ground , and the people hurried on board the ships in such a way that but a few families remained undivided .</p>
   <p>Longfellow 's poem of “ Evangeline ” is founded on this incident , and the above selection describes the scene where the male inhabitants of Grand-Pre ’ are assembled in the church , and the order for their banishment is first made known to them .</p>

    <head>LXXIII . SONG OF THE SHIRT . ( 266 )</head>
    <head>Thomas Hood , 1798-1845 , the son of a London bookseller , was born in that city . He undertook , after leaving school , to learn the art of an engraver , but soon gave up the business , and turned his attention to literature . His lighter pieces , exhibiting his skill as a wit and punster , soon became well known and popular . In 1821 he became subeditor of the “ London Magazine , ” and formed the acquaintance of the literary men of the metropolis . The last years of his life were clouded by poverty and ill health . Some of his most humorous pieces were written on a sick bed . Hood is best known as a joker — a writer of “ whims and oddities ” — but he was no mere joker . Some of his pieces are filled with the tenderest pathos ; and a gentle spirit , in love with justice and humanity , pervades even his lighter compositions . His “ Song of the Shirt ” first appeared in the “ London Punch . ” ###</head>

   <p>LXXIV . DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND . ( 269 )</p>
   <p>Edouard Rene Lefebvre-Laboulaye , 1811-1883 , was a French writer of note . Most of his works involve questions of law and politics , and are considered high authority on the questions discussed . A few works , such as “ Abdallah , ” from which the following extract is adapted , were written as a mere recreation in the midst of law studies ; they show great imaginative power . Laboulaye took great interest in the United States , her people , and her literature ; and many of his works are devoted to American questions . He translated the works of Dr. William E. Channing into French . ###</p>
   <p>Mansour , the Egyptian merchant , one day repaired to the cadi on account of a suit , the issue of which troubled him but little . A private conversation with the judge had given him hopes of the justice of his cause . The old man asked his son Omar to accompany him in order to accustom him early to deal with the law .</p>
   <p>The cadi was seated in the courtyard of the mosque . He was a fat , good-looking man , who never thought , and talked little , which , added to his large turban and his air of perpetual astonishment , gave him a great reputation for justice and gravity .</p>
   <p>The spectators were numerous ; the principal merchants were seated on the ground on carpets , forming a semicircle around the magistrate . Mansour took his seat a little way from the sheik , and Omar placed himself between the two , his curiosity strongly excited to see how the law was obeyed , and how it was trifled with in case of need .</p>
   <p>The first case called was that of a young Banian , as yellow as an orange , with loose flowing robes and an effeminate air , who had lately landed from India , and who complained of having been cheated by one of Mansour 's rivals .</p>
   <p>“ Having found a casket of diamonds among the effects left by my father , ” said he , “ I set out for Egypt , to live there on the proceeds of their sale . I was obliged by bad weather to put into Jidda , where I soon found myself in want of money . I went to the bazaar , and inquired for a dealer in precious stones . The richest , I was told , was Mansour ; the most honest , Ali , the jeweler . I applied to Ali .</p>
   <p>“ He welcomed me as a son , as soon as he learned that I had diamonds to sell , and carried me home with him . He gained my confidence by every kind of attention , and advanced me all the money I needed . One day , after dinner , at which wine was not wanting , he examined the diamonds , one by one , and said , ‘ My child , these diamonds are of little value ; my coffers are full of such stones . The rocks of the desert furnish them by thousands . ’</p>
   <p>“ To prove the truth of what he said , he opened a box , and , taking therefrom a diamond thrice as large as any of mine , gave it to the slave that was with me . ‘ What will become of me ? ’ I cried ; ‘ I thought myself rich , and here I am , poor , and a stranger . ’</p>
   <p>“ ‘ My child , ’ replied Ali , ‘ Leave this casket with me , and I will give you a price for it such as no one else would offer . Choose whatever you wish in Jidda , and in two hours I will give you an equal weight of what you have chosen in exchange for your Indian stones . ’</p>
   <p>“ On returning home , night brought reflection . I learned that Ali had been deceiving me . What he had given to the slave was nothing but a bit of crystal . I demanded my casket . Ali refused to restore it . Venerable magistrate , my sole hope is in your justice . ”</p>
   <p>It was now Ali 's turn to speak . “ Illustrious cadi , ” said he , “ It is true that we made a bargain , which I am ready to keep , The rest of the young man 's story is false . What matters it what I gave the slave ? Did I force the stranger to leave the casket in my hands ? Why does he accuse me of treachery ? Have I broken my word , and has he kept his ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Young man , ” said the cadi to the Banian , “ have you witnesses to prove that Ali deceived you ? If not , I shall put the accused on his oath , as the law decrees . ” A Koran was brought . Ali placed his hand on it , and swore three times that he had not deceived the stranger . “ Wretch , ” said the Banian , “ thou art among those whose feet go down to destruction . Thou hast thrown away thy soul . ”</p>
   <p>Omar smiled , and while Ali was enjoying the success of his ruse , he approached the stranger , and asked , “ Do you wish me to help you gain the suit ? ” “ Yes , ” was the reply ; “ but you are only a child — you can do nothing . ”</p>
   <p>“ Have confidence in me a few moments , ” said Omar ; “ accept Ali 's bargain ; let me choose in your stead , and fear nothing . ”</p>
   <p>The stranger bowed his head , and murmured , “ What can I fear after having lost all ? ” Then , turning to the cadi , and bowing respectfully , “ Let the bargain be consummated , ” said he , “ since the law decrees it , and let this young man choose in my stead what I shall receive in payment . ”</p>
   <p>A profound silence ensued . Omar rose , and , bowing to the cadi , “ Ali , ” said he to the jeweler , “ you have doubtless brought the casket , and can tell us the weight thereof . ”</p>
   <p>“ Here it is , ” said Ali ; “ it weighs twenty pounds . Choose what you will ; if the thing asked for is in Jidda , you shall have it within two hours , otherwise the bargain is null and void . ”</p>
   <p>“ What we desire , ” said Omar , raising his voice , “ is ants ’ wings , half male and half female . You have two hours in which to furnish the twenty pounds you have promised us . ” “ This is absurd , ” cried the jeweler ; “ it is impossible . I should need half a score of persons and six months labor to satisfy so foolish a demand . ”</p>
   <p>“ Are there any winged ants in Jidda ? ” asked the cadi . “ Of course , ” answered the merchants , laughing ; “ they are one of the plagues of Egypt . Our houses are full of them , and it would be doing us a great service to rid us of them . ”</p>
   <p>“ Then Ali must keep his promise or give back the casket , ” said the cadi . “ This young man was mad to sell his diamonds weight for weight ; he is mad to exact such payment . So much the better for Ali the first time : so much the worse for him the second . Justice has not two weights and measures . Every bargain holds good before the law . Either furnish twenty pounds of ants ’ wings , or restore the casket to the Banian . ” “ A righteous judgment , ” shouted the spectators , wonder-struck at such equity .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>In front of a middle-eastern building ; a man seated with a sword and water-pipe , facing a crowd . A small boy with his left arm outstreached , is speaking to the man . A taller young man stands to the right of the small boy ; an older man stands further to the right .</p>
   </figure>
   <p>The stranger , beside himself with joy , took from the casket three diamonds of the finest water ; he forced them on Omar , who put them in his girdle , and seated himself by his father , his gravity unmoved by the gaze of the assembly . “ Well done , ” said Mansour ; “ but it is my turn now ; mark me well , and profit by the lesson I shall give you . Stop , young man ! ” he cried to the Banian , “ we have an account to settle . ”</p>
   <p>“ The day before yesterday , ” continued he , “ this young man entered my shop , and , bursting into tears , kissed my hand and entreated me to sell him a necklace which I had already sold to the Pasha of Egypt , saying that his life and that of a lady depended upon it . ‘ Ask of me what you will , my father , ’ said he , ‘ but I must have these gems or die . ’</p>
   <p>“ I have a weakness for young men , and , though I knew the danger of disappointing my master the pasha , I was unable to resist his supplications . ‘ Take the necklace , ’ said I to him , ‘ but promise to give whatever I may ask in exchange . ’ ‘ My head itself , if you will , ’ he replied , ‘ for you have saved my life , ’ We were without witnesses , but , ” added Mansour , turning to the Banian , “ is not my story true ? ”</p>
   <p>“ Yes , ” said the young man , “ and I beg your pardon for not having satisfied you sooner : you know the cause . Ask of me what you desire . ”</p>
   <p>“ What I desire , ” said Mansour , “ is the casket with all its contents . Illustrious magistrate , you have declared that all bargains hold good before the law ; this young man has promised to give me what I please ; now I declare that nothing pleases me but these diamonds . ”</p>
   <p>The cadi raised his head and looked about the assembly , as if to interrogate the faces , then stroked his beard , and relapsed into his meditations .</p>
   <p>“ Ali is defeated , ” said the sheik to Omar , with a smile , “ The fox is not yet born more cunning than the worthy Mansour . ”</p>
   <p>“ I am lost ! ” cried the Banian . “ O Omar , have you saved me only to cast me down from the highest pinnacle of joy to the depths of despair ? Persuade your father to spare me , that I may owe my life to you a second time . ”</p>
   <p>“ Well , my son , ” said Mansour , “ doubtless you are shrewd , but this will teach you that your father knows rather more than you do . The cadi is about to decide : try whether you can dictate his decree . ”</p>
   <p>“ It is mere child 's play , ” answered Omar , shrugging his shoulders ; “ but since you desire it , my father , you shall lose your suit . ” He rose , and taking a piaster from his girdle , put it into the hand of the Banian , who laid it before the judge .</p>
   <p>“ Illustrious cadi , ” said Omar , “ this young man is ready to fulfill his engagement . This is what he offers Mansour — piaster . In itself this coin is of little value ; but examine it closely , and you will see that it is stamped with the likeness of the sultan , our glorious master . May God destroy and confound all who disobey his highness !</p>
   <p>“ It is this precious likeness that we offer you , ” added he , turning to Mansour ; “ if it pleases you , you are paid ; to say that it displeases you is an insult to the pasha , a crime punishable by death ; and I am sure that our worthy cadi will not become your accomplice — he who has always been and always will be the faithful servant of an the sultans . ”</p>
   <p>When Omar had finished speaking , all eyes turned toward the cadi , who , more impenetrable than ever , stroked his face and waited for the old man to come to his aid . Mansour was agitated and embarrassed . The silence of the cadi and the assembly terrified him , and he cast a supplicating glance toward his son .</p>
   <p>“ My father , ” said Omar , “ permit this young man to thank you for the lesson of prudence which you have given him by frightening him a little . He knows well that it was you who sent me to his aid , and that all this is a farce . No one is deceived by hearing the son oppose the Father , and who has ever doubted Mansour 's experience and generosity ? ”</p>
   <p>“ No one , ” interrupted the cadi , starting up like a man suddenly awakened from a dream , “ and I least of all ; and this is why I have permitted you to speak , my young Solomon . I wished to honor in you the wisdom of your father ; but another time avoid meddling with his highness 's name ; it is not safe to sport with the lion 's paws . The matter is settled . The necklace is worth a hundred thousand piasters , is it not , Mansour ? This madcap , shall give you , therefore , a hundred thousand piasters , and all parties will be satisfied . ”</p>

   <p>NOTES .— Thanatopsis is composed of two Greek words , thanatos , meaning death , and opsis , a view . The word , therefore , signifies a view of death , or reflections on death .</p>
   <p>Barca is in the northeastern part of Africa : the southern and eastern portions of the country are a barren desert .</p>
   <p>The Oregon ( or Columbia ) River is the most important river of the United States emptying into the Pacific . The Lewis and Clark Expedition ( 1803-1806 ) had first explored the country through which it flows only five years before the poem was written .</p>
   <p>LXXVI . INDIAN JUGGLERS . ( 278 )</p>
   <p>William Hazlitt , 1778-1830 , was born in Maidstone , England . His father was a Unitarian clergyman , and he was sent to a college of that denomination to be educated for the ministry ; but having a greater taste for art than theology , he resolved , on leaving school , to devote himself to painting . He succeeded so well in his efforts as to meet the warmest commendation of his friends , but did not succeed in satisfying his own fastidious taste . On this account he threw away his pencil and took up his pen . His works , though numerous , are , with the exception of a life of Napoleon , chiefly criticisms on literature and art .</p>
   <p>Hazlitt is thought to have treated his contemporaries with an unjust severity ; but his genial appreciation of the English classics , and the thorough and loving manner in which he discusses their merits , make his essays the delight of every lover of those perpetual wellsprings of intellectual pleasure . His “ Table Talk , ” “ Characters of Shakespeare 's Plays , ” “ Lectures on the English Poets , ” and “ Lectures on the Literature of the Elizabethan Age , ” are the works that exhibit his style and general merits in their most favorable light . ###</p>
   <p>Coming forward and seating himself on the ground , in his white dress and tightened turban , the chief of the Indian jugglers begins with tossing up two brass balls , which is what any of us could do , and concludes by keeping up four at the same time , which is what none of us could do to save our lives , not if we were to take our whole lives to do it in .</p>
   <p>Is it then a trifling power we see at work , or is it not something next to miraculous ? It is the utmost stretch of human ingenuity , which nothing but the bending the faculties of body and mind to it from the tenderest infancy with incessant , ever-anxious application up to manhood , can accomplish or make even a slight approach to . Man , thou art a wonderful animal , and thy ways past finding out ! Thou canst do strange things , but thou turnest them to small account !</p>
   <p>To conceive of this extraordinary dexterity , distracts the imagination and makes admiration breathless . Yet it costs nothing to the performer , any more than if it were a mere mechanical deception with which he had nothing to do , but to watch and laugh at the astonishment of the spectators . A single error of a hair 's breadth , of the smallest conceivable portion of time , would be fatal ; the precision of the movements must be like a mathematical truth ; their rapidity is like lightning .</p>
   <p>To catch four balls in succession , in less than a second of time , and deliver them back so as to return with seeming consciousness to the hand again ; to make them revolve around him at certain intervals , like the planets in their spheres ; to make them chase each other like sparkles of fire , or shoot up like flowers or meteors ; to throw them behind his back , and twine them round his neck like ribbons , or like serpents ; to do what appears an impossibility , and to do it with all the ease , the grace , the carelessness imaginable ; to laugh at , to play with the glittering mockeries , to follow them with his eye as if he could fascinate them with its lambent fire , or as if he had only to see that they kept time with the music on the stage — there is something in all this which he who does not admire may be quite sure he never really admired anything in the whole course of his life . It is skill surmounting difficulty , and beauty triumphing over skill . It seems as if the difficulty , once mastered , naturally resolved itself into ease and grace , and as if , to be overcome at all , it must be overcome without an effort . The smallest awkwardness or want of pliancy or self-possession would stop the whole process . It is the work of witchcraft , and yet sport for children .</p>
   <p>Some of the other feats are quite as curious and wonderful — such as the balancing the artificial tree , and shooting a bird from each branch through a quill — though none of them have the elegance or facility of the keeping up of the brass balls . You are in pain for the result , and glad when the experiment is over ; they are not accompanied with the same unmixed , unchecked delight as the former ; and I would not give much to be merely astonished without being pleased at the same time . As to the swallowing of the sword , the police ought to interfere to prevent it .</p>
   <p>When I saw the Indian juggler do the same things before , his feet were bare , and he had large rings on his toes , which he kept turning round all the time of the performance , as if they moved of themselves .</p>
   <p>The hearing a speech in Parliament drawled or stammered out by the honorable member or the noble lord , the ringing the changes on their commonplaces , which anyone could repeat after them as well as they , stirs me not a jot ,— shakes not my good opinion of myself . I ask what there is that I can do as well as this . Nothing . What have I been doing all my life ? Have I been idle , or have I nothing to show for all my labor and pains ? Or have I passed my time in pouring words like water into empty sieves , rolling a stone up a hill and then down again , trying to prove an argument in the teeth of facts , and looking for causes in the dark , and not finding them ? Is there no one thing in which I can challenge competition , that I can bring as an instance of exact perfection , in which others can not find a flaw ?</p>
   <p>The utmost I can pretend to is to write a description of what this fellow can do . I can write a book : so can many others who have not even learned to spell . What abortions are these essays ! What errors , what ill-pieced transitions , what crooked reasons , what lame conclusions ! How little is made out , and that little how ill ! Yet they are the best I can do .</p>
   <p>I endeavor to recollect all I have ever heard or thought upon a subject , and to express it as neatly as I can . Instead of writing on four subjects at a time , it is as much as I can manage , to keep the thread of one discourse clear and unentangled . I have also time on my hands to correct my opinions and polish my periods ; but the one I can not , and the other I will not , do . I am fond of arguing ; yet , with a good deal of pains and practice , it is often much as I can do to beat my man , though he may be a very indifferent hand . A common fencer would disarm his adversary in the twinkling of an eye , unless he were a professor like himself . A stroke of wit will sometimes produce this effect , but there is no such power or superiority in sense or reasoning . There is no complete mastery of execution to be shown there ; and you hardly know the professor from the impudent pretender or the mere clown .</p>

     <l n="135">Shakespeare .— Julius Caesar , Act iii , Scene ii .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>NOTES .— Gaius Julius Caesar ( b . 102 , d. 44 B. C .) was the most remarkable genius of the ancient world , Caesar ruled Rome as imperator five years and a half , and , in the intervals of seven campaigns during that time , spent only fifteen months in Rome . Under his rule Rome was probably at her best , and his murder at once produced a state of anarchy .</p>
   <p>The conspirators against Caesar — among whom were Brutus , Cassius and Casca — professed to be moved by honest zeal for the good of Rome ; but their own ambition was no doubt the true motive , except with Brutus .</p>
   <p>Mark Antony was a strong friend of Julius Caesar . Upon the latter 's death , Antony , by his funeral oration , incited the people and drove the conspirators from Rome .</p>
   <p>The Lupercal was a festival of purification and expiation held in Rome on the 15th of February . Antony was officiating as priest at this festival when he offered the crown to Caesar .</p>
   <p>In his will Caesar left to every citizen of Rome a sum of money , and bequeathed his private gardens to the public .</p>
   <p>The Nervii were one of the most warlike tribes of Celtic Gaul . Caesar almost annihilated them in 57 B. C .</p>
   <p>Pompey , once associated with Caesar in the government of Rome , was afterwards at war with him . He was murdered by those who thought to propitiate Caesar , but the latter wept when Pompey 's head was sent to him , and had the murderers put to death .</p>
   <p>Statua is the Latin form of statue , in common use in Shakespeare 's time ; this form is required here by the meter .</p>
   <p>LXXVIII . THE ENGLISH CHARACTER . ( 286 )</p>
   <p>William Hickling Prescott , 1796-1859 , the historian , was the son of William Prescott , an eminent jurist , and the grandson of Col. William Prescott , who commanded the Americans at the battle of Bunker Hill . He was born in Salem , Massachusetts , graduated at Harvard University in 1814 , and died in Boston . Just as he was completing his college course , the careless sport of a fellow-student injured one of his eyes so seriously that he never recovered from it . He had intended to adopt law as his profession ; but , from his detective eyesight , he was obliged to choose work in which he could regulate his hours of labor , and could employ the aid of a secretary . He chose to be a historian ; and followed his choice with wonderful system , perseverance , and success till the close of his life . His works are : “ The Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella , ” “ The Conquest of Mexico , ” “ The Conquest of Peru , ” “ The Reign of Philip II , ” and a volume of “ Miscellanies . ” He had not completed the history of Philip at the time of his death . As a writer of history , Mr. Prescott ranks with the first for accuracy , precision , clearness , and beauty of style . As a man , he was genial , kind-hearted and even-tempered . ###</p>
   <p>On the whole , what I have seen raises my preconceived estimate of the English character . It is full of generous , true , and manly qualities ; and I doubt if there ever was so high a standard of morality in an aristocracy which has such means for self-indulgence at its command , and which occupies a position that secures it so much deference . In general , they do not seem to abuse their great advantages . The respect for religion — at least for the forms of it — is universal , and there are few , I imagine , of the great proprietors who are not more or less occupied with improving their estates , and with providing for the comfort of their tenantry , while many take a leading part in the great political movements of the time . There never was an aristocracy which combined so much practical knowledge and industry with the advantages of exalted rank .</p>
   <p>The Englishman is seen to most advantage in his country home . For he is constitutionally both domestic and rural in his habits . His fireside and his farm — these are the places in which one sees his simple and warm - hearted nature more freely unfolded . There is a shyness in an Englishman , — a natural reserve , which makes him cold to strangers , and difficult to approach . But once corner him in his own house , a frank and full expansion will be given to his feelings that we should look for in vain in the colder Yankee , and a depth not to be found in the light and superficial Frenchman ,— speaking of nationalities , not of individualities .</p>
   <p>The Englishman is the most truly rural in his tastes and habits of any people in the world . I am speaking of the higher classes . The aristocracy of other countries affect the camp and the city . But the English love their old castles and country seats with a patriotic love . They are fond of country sports . Every man shoots or hunts . No man is too old to be in the saddle some part of the day , and men of seventy years and more follow the hounds , and , take a five-barred gate at a leap . The women are good whips , are fond of horses and dogs , and other animals . Duchesses have their cows , their poultry , their pigs ,— all watched over and provided with accommodations of Dutch-like neatness . All this is characteristic of the people . It may be thought to detract something from the feminine graces which in other lands make a woman so amiably dependent as to be nearly imbecile . But it produces a healthy and blooming race of women to match the hardy Englishman ,— the finest development of the physical and moral nature which the world has witnessed . For we are not to look on the English gentleman as a mere Nimrod . With all his relish for field sports and country usages , he has his house filled with collections of art and with extensive libraries . The tables of the drawing-rooms are covered with the latest works , sent down by the London publisher . Every guest is provided with an apparatus for writing , and often a little library of books for his own amusement . The English country gentleman of the present day is anything but a Squire Western , though he does retain all his relish for field sports .</p>
   <p>The character of an Englishman , under its most refined aspect , has some disagreeable points which jar unpleasantly on the foreigner not accustomed to them . The consciousness of national superiority , combined with natural feelings of independence , gives him an air of arrogance , though it must be owned that this is never betrayed in his own house ,— I may almost say in his own country . But abroad , when he seems to institute a comparison between himself and the people he is thrown with , it becomes so obvious that he is the most unpopular , not to say odious , person in the world . Even the open hand with which he dispenses his bounty will not atone for the violence he offers to national vanity .</p>
   <p>There are other defects , which are visible even in his most favored circumstances . Such is his bigotry , surpassing everything in a quiet passive form , that has been witnessed since the more active bigotry of the times of the Spanish Philips . Such , too , is the exclusive , limited range of his knowledge and conceptions of all political and social topics and relations . The Englishman , the cultivated Englishman , has no standard of excellence borrowed from mankind . His speculation never travels beyond his own little — great little — island . That is the world to him . True , he travels , shoots lions among the Hottentots , chases the grizzly bear over the Rocky Mountains , kills elephants in India and salmon on the coast of Labrador , comes home , and very likely makes a book . But the scope of his ideas does not seem to be enlarged by all this . The body travels , not the mind . And , however he may abuse his own land , he returns home as hearty a John Bull , with all his prejudices and national tastes as rooted , as before . The English — the men of fortune — all travel . Yet how little sympathy they show for other people or institutions , and how slight is the interest they take in them ! They are islanders , cut off from the great world . But their island is , indeed , a world of its own . With all their faults , never has the sun shone — if one may use the expression in reference to England — all a more noble race , or one that has done more for the great interests of humanity .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Nimrod is spoken of in Genesis ( x . 9 ) as “ a mighty hunter . ” Thus the name came to be applied to any one devoted to hunting .</p>
   <p>Squire Western is a character in Fielding 's “ Tom Jones . ” He is represented as an ignorant , prejudiced , irascible , but , withal , a jolly , good-humored English country gentleman .</p>

   <p>LXXX . A HOT DAY IN NEW YORK . ( 292 )</p>
   <p>William Dean Howells , 1837 —, was born in Belmont County . Ohio . In boyhood he learned the printer 's trade , at which he worked for several years . He published a volume of poems in 1860 , in connection with John J. Piatt . From 1861 to 1865 he was United States Consul at Venice . On his return he resided for a time in New York City , and was one of the editors of the “ Nation . ” In 1871 he was appointed editor in chief of the “ Atlantic Monthly . ” He held the position ten years , and then retired in order to devote himself to his own writings . Since then , he has been connected with other literary magazines . Mr. Howells has written several books : novels and sketches : his writings are marked by an artistic finish , and a keen but subtile humor . The following selection is an extract from “ Their Wedding Journey . ” ###</p>
   <p>When they alighted , they took their way up through one of the streets of the great wholesale businesses , to Broadway . On this street was a throng of trucks and wagons , lading and unlading ; bales and boxes rose and sank by pulleys overhead ; the footway was a labyrinth of packages of every shape and size ; there was no flagging of the pitiless energy that moved all forward , no sign of how heavy a weight lay on it , save in the reeking faces of its helpless instruments .</p>
   <p>It was four o'clock , the deadliest hour of the deadly summer day . The spiritless air seemed to have a quality of blackness in it , as if filled with the gloom of low-hovering wings . One half the street lay in shadow , and one half in sun ; but the sunshine itself was dim , as if a heat greater than its own had smitten it with languor . Little gusts of sick , warm wind blew across the great avenue at the corners of the intersecting streets . In the upward distance , at which the journeyers looked , the loftier roofs and steeples lifted themselves dim out of the livid atmosphere , and far up and down the length of the street swept a stream of tormented life .</p>
   <p>All sorts of wheeled things thronged it , conspicuous among which rolled and jarred the gaudily painted stages , with quivering horses driven each by a man who sat in the shade of a branching , white umbrella , and suffered with a moody truculence of aspect , and as if he harbored the bitterness of death in his heart for the crowding passengers within , when one of them pulled the strap about his legs , and summoned him to halt .</p>
   <p>Most of the foot passengers kept to the shady side , and to the unaccustomed eyes of the strangers they were not less in number than at any other time , though there were fewer women among them . Indomitably resolute of soul , they held their course with the swift pace of custom , and only here and there they showed the effect of the heat .</p>
   <p>One man , collarless , with waistcoat unbuttoned , and hat set far back from his forehead , waved a fan before his death-white , flabby face , and set down one foot after the other with the heaviness of a somnambulist . Another , as they passed him , was saying huskily to the friend at his side , “ I can n't stand this much longer . My hands tingle as if they had gone to sleep ; my heart — ” But still the multitude hurried on , passing , repassing , encountering , evading , vanishing into shop doors , and emerging from them , dispersing down the side streets , and swarming out of them .</p>
   <p>It was a scene that possessed the beholder with singular fascination , and in its effect of universal lunacy , it might well have seemed the last phase of a world presently to be destroyed . They who were in it , but not of it , as they fancied — though there was no reason for this — looked on it amazed , and at last their own errands being accomplished , and themselves so far cured of the madness of purpose , they cried with one voice that it was a hideous sight , and strove to take refuge from it in the nearest place where the soda fountain sparkled .</p>
   <p>It was a vain desire . At the front door of the apothecary 's hung a thermometer , and as they entered they heard the next comer cry out with a maniacal pride in the affliction laid upon mankind , “ Ninety-seven degrees ! ” Behind them , at the door , there poured in a ceaseless stream of people , each pausing at the shrine of heat , before he tossed off the hissing draught that two pale , close-clipped boys served them from either side of the fountain . Then , in the order of their coming , they issued through another door upon the side street , each , as he disappeared , turning his face half round , and casting a casual glance upon a little group near another counter .</p>
   <p>The group was of a very patient , half-frightened , half-puzzled looking gentleman who sat perfectly still on a stool , and of a lady who stood beside him , rubbing all over his head a handkerchief full of pounded ice , and easing one hand with the other when the first became tired . Basil drank his soda , and paused to look upon this group , which he felt would commend itself to realistic sculpture as eminently characteristic of the local life , and , as “ The Sunstroke , ” would sell enormously in the hot season .</p>
   <p>“ Better take a little more of that , ” the apothecary said , looking up from his prescription , and , as the organized sympathy of the seemingly indifferent crowd , smiling very kindly at his patient , who thereupon tasted something in the glass he held .</p>
   <p>“ Do you still feel like fainting ? ” asked the humane authority . “ Slightly , now and then , ” answered the other , “ but I 'm hanging on hard to the bottom curve of that icicled S on your soda fountain , and I feel that I 'm all right as long as I can see that . The people get rather hazy occasionally , and have no features to speak of . But I do  n't know that I look very impressive myself , ” he added in the jesting mood which seems the natural condition of Americans in the face of an embarrassments .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , you 'll do ! ” the apothecary answered , with a laugh ; but he said , in an answer to an anxious question from the lady , “ He must n't be moved for an hour yet , ” and gayly pestled away at a prescription , while she resumed her office of grinding the pounded ice round and round upon her husband 's skull . Isabel offered her the commiseration of friendly words , and of looks kinder yet , and then , seeing that they could do nothing , she and Basil fell into the endless procession , and passed out of the side door .</p>
   <p>“ What a shocking thing , ” she whispered . “ Did you see how all the people looked , one after another , so indifferently at that couple , and evidently forgot them the next instant ? It was dreadful . I should  n't like to have you sun-struck in New York . ”</p>
   <p>“ That 's very considerate of you ; but place for place , if any accident must happen to me among strangers , I think I should prefer to have it in New York . The biggest place is always the kindest as well as the cruelest place . Amongst the thousands of spectators the good Samaritan as well as the Levite would be sure to be . As for a sunstroke , it requires peculiar gifts . But if you compel me to a choice in the matter , then I say give me the busiest part of Broadway for a sunstroke . There is such experience of calamity there that you could hardly fall the first victim to any misfortune . ”</p>
   <p>LXXXI . DISCONTENT .— AN ALLEGORY . ( 295 )</p>
   <p>Joseph Addison , 1672-1719 , the brilliant essayist and poet , has long occupied an exalted place in English literature . He was the son of an English clergyman , was born in Wiltshire , and educated at Oxford ; he died at “ Holland House ” ( the property of his wile , to whom he had been married but about two years ) , and was buried in Westminster Abbey . Several years of his life were spent in the political affairs of his time , he held several public offices , and was , for ten years , a member of Parliament . His fame as an author rests chiefly upon his “ Hymns , ” his tragedy of “ Cato , ” and his “ Essays ” contributed principally to the “ Tatler ” and the “ Spectator . ” The excellent style of his essays , their genial wit and sprightly humor , made them conspicuous in an age when coarseness , bitterness , and exaggeration deformed the writings of the most eminent : and these characteristics have given them an unquestioned place among the classics of our language .</p>
   <p>Mr. Addison was shy and diffident , but genial and lovable ; his moral character was above reproach , excepting that he is said to have been too fond of wine . ###</p>
   <p>It is a celebrated thought of Socrates , that if all the misfortunes of mankind were cast into a public stock , in order to be equally distributed among the whole species , those who now think themselves the most unhappy , would prefer the share they are already possessed of before that which would fall to them by such a division . Horace has carried this thought a great deal farther , and supposes that the hardships or misfortunes we lie under , are more easy to us than those of any other person would be , in case we could change conditions with him .</p>
   <p>As I was ruminating on these two remarks , and seated in my elbowchair , I insensibly fell asleep ; when , on a sudden , methought there was a proclamation made by Jupiter , that every mortal should bring in his griefs and calamities , and throw them together in a heap . There was a large plain appointed for this purpose . I took my stand in the center of it , and saw , with a great deal of pleasure , the whole human species marching one after another , and throwing down their several loads , which immediately grew up into a prodigious mountain , that seemed to rise above the clouds .</p>
   <p>There was a certain lady of a thin , airy shape , who was very active in this solemnity . She carried a magnifying glass in one of her hands , and was clothed in a loose , flowing robe , embroidered with several figures of fiends and specters , that discovered themselves in a thousand chimerical shapes as her garment hovered in the wind . There was something wild and distracted in her looks . Her name was Fancy . She led up every mortal to the appointed place , after having officiously assisted him in making up his pack , and laying it upon his shoulders . My heart melted within me to see my fellow-creatures groaning under their respective burdens , and to consider that prodigious bulk of human calamities which lay before me .</p>
   <p>There were , however , several persons who gave me great diversion upon this occasion . I observed one bringing in a fardel , very carefully concealed under an old embroidered cloak , which , upon his throwing it into the heap , I discovered to be poverty . Another , after a great deal of puffing , threw down his luggage , which , upon examining , I found to be his wife .</p>
   <p>There were multitudes of lovers saddled with very whimsical burdens , composed of darts and flames ; but , what was very odd , though they sighed as if their hearts would break under these bundles of calamities , they could not persuade themselves to cast them into the heap , when they came up to it ; but , after a few faint efforts , shook their heads , and marched away as heavy loaden as they came .</p>
   <p>I saw multitudes of old women throw down their wrinkles , and several young ones who stripped themselves of a tawny skin . There were very great heaps of red noses , large lips , and rusty teeth . The truth of it is , I was surprised to see the greatest part of the mountain made up of bodily deformities . Observing one advancing toward the heap with a larger cargo than ordinary upon his back , I found , upon his near approach , that it was only a natural hump , which he disposed of with great joy of heart among this collection of human miseries .</p>
   <p>There were , likewise , distempers of all sorts , though I could not but observe that there were many more imaginary than real . One little packet I could not but take notice of , which was a complication of all the diseases incident to human nature , and was in the hand of a great many fine people . This was called the spleen . But what most of all surprised me was , that there was not a single vice or folly thrown into the whole heap : at which I was very much astonished , having concluded within myself that everyone would take this opportunity of getting rid of his passions , prejudices , and frailties .</p>
   <p>I took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow , who , I did not question , came loaden with his crimes , but upon searching into his bundle , I found that instead of throwing his guilt from him , he had only laid down his memory . He was followed by another worthless rogue , who flung away his modesty instead of his ignorance .</p>
   <p>When the whole race of mankind had thus cast their burdens , the phantom which had been so busy on this occasion , seeing me an idle spectator of what passed , approached toward me . I grew uneasy at her presence , when , of a sudden , she held her magnifying glass full before my eyes . I no sooner saw my face in it , but was startled at the shortness of it , which now appeared to me in its utmost aggravation . The immoderate breadth of the features made me very much out of humor with my own countenance , upon which I threw it from me like a mask . It happened very luckily that one who stood by me had just before thrown down his visage , which , it seems , was too long for him . It was , indeed , extended to a most shameful length ; I believe the very chin was , modestly speaking , as long as my whole face . We had both of us an opportunity of mending ourselves ; and all the contributions being now brought in , every man was at liberty to exchange his misfortunes for those of another person .</p>
   <p>As we stood round the heap , and surveyed the several materials of which it was composed , there was scarcely a mortal in this vast multitude who did not discover what he thought pleasures and blessings of life , and wondered how the owners of them ever came to look upon them as burthens and grievances . As we were regarding very attentively this confusion of miseries , this chaos of calamity , Jupiter issued out a second proclamation , that everyone was now at liberty to exchange his affliction , and to return to his habitation with any such other bundle as should be delivered to him . Upon this , Fancy began again to bestir herself , and , parceling out the whole heap with incredible activity , recommended to everyone his particular packet . The hurry and confusion at this time was not to be expressed . Some observations , which I made upon the occasion , I shall communicate to the public .</p>
   <p>A venerable , gray-headed man , who had laid down the colic , and who , I found , wanted an heir to his estate , snatched up an undutiful son that had been thrown into the heap by an angry father . The graceless youth , in less than a quarter of an hour , pulled the old gentleman by the beard , and had liked to have knocked his brains out ; so that meeting the true father , who came toward him with a fit of the gripes , he begged him to take his son again , and give him back his colic ; but they were incapable , either of them , to recede from the choice they had made . A poor galley slave , who had thrown down his chains , took up the gout in their stead , but made such wry faces that one might easily perceive he was no great gainer by the bargain .</p>
   <p>The female world were very busy among themselves in bartering for features ; one was trucking a lock of gray hairs for a carbuncle ; and another was making over a short waist for a pair of round shoulders ; but on all these occasions there was not one of them who did not think the new blemish , as soon as she had got it into her possession , much more disagreeable than the old one .</p>
   <p>I must not omit my own particular adventure . My friend with the long visage had no sooner taken upon him my short face , but he made such a grotesque figure in it , that as I looked upon him , I could not forbear laughing at myself , insomuch that I put my own face out of countenance . The poor gentleman was so sensible of the ridicule , that I found he was ashamed of what he had done . On the other side , I found that I myself had no great reason to triumph , for as I went to touch my forehead , I missed the place , and clapped my finger upon my upper lip . Besides , as my nose was exceedingly prominent , I gave it two or three unlucky knocks as I was playing my hand about my face , and aiming at some other part of it .</p>
   <p>I saw two other gentlemen by me who were in the same ridiculous circumstances . These had made a foolish swap between a couple of thick bandy legs and two long trapsticks that had no calves to them . One of these looked like a man walking upon stilts , and was so lifted up into the air , above his ordinary height , that his head turned round with it , while the other made such awkward circles , as he attempted to walk , that he scarcely knew how to move forward upon his new supporters . Observing him to be a pleasant kind of a fellow , I stuck my cane in the ground , and told him I would lay him a bottle of wine that he did not march up to it on a line that I drew for him , in a quarter of an hour .</p>
   <p>The heap was at last distributed among the two sexes , who made a most piteous sight , as they wandered up and down under the pressure of their several burthens . The whole plain was filled with murmurs and complaints , groans and lamentations . Jupiter , at length taking compassion on the poor mortals , ordered them a second time to lay down their loads , with a design to give everyone his own again . They discharged themselves with a great deal of pleasure ; after which , the phantom who had led them into such gross delusions , was commanded to disappear . There was sent in her stead a goddess of a quite different figure : her motions were steady and composed , and her aspect serious but cheerful . She every now and then cast her eyes toward heaven , and fixed them upon Jupiter . Her name was Patience . She had no sooner placed herself by the Mount of Sorrows , but , what I thought very remarkable , the whole heap sunk to such a degree that it did not appear a third part so big as it was before . She afterward returned every man his own proper calamity , and , teaching him how to bear it in the most commodious manner , he marched off with it contentedly , being very well pleased that he had not been left to his own choice as to the kind of evil which fell to his lot .</p>
   <p>Beside the several pieces of morality to be drawn out of this vision , I learnt from it never to repine at my own misfortunes , or to envy the happiness of another , since it is impossible for any man to form a right judgment of his neighbor 's sufferings ; for which reason , also , I have determined never to think too lightly of another 's complaints , but to regard the sorrows of my fellow-creatures with sentiments of humanity and compassion .</p>

     <l n="1">SIR ROBERT BRAMBLE and HUMPHREY DOBBINS .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Sir R. I 'll tell you what , Humphrey Dobbins , there is not a syllable of sense in all you have been saying . But I suppose you will maintain there is .</p>
   <p>Hum . Yes .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Yes ! Is that the way you talk to me , you old boor ? What 's my name ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Robert Bramble .</p>
   <p>Sir R. A n't I a baronet ? Sir Robert Bramble , of Blackberry Hall , in the county of Kent ? ‘ T is time you should know it , for you have been my clumsy , two-fisted valet these thirty years : can you deny that ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Hem !</p>
   <p>Sir R. Hem ? What do you mean by hem ? Open that rusty door of your mouth , and make your ugly voice walk out of it . Why do n't you answer my question ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Because , if I contradict you , I shall tell you a lie , and whenever I agree with you , you are sure to fall out .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Humphrey Dobbins . I have been so long endeavoring to beat a few brains into your pate that all your hair has tumbled off before my point is carried .</p>
   <p>Hum . What then ? Our parson says my head is an emblem of both our honors .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Ay ; because honors , like your head , are apt to be empty .</p>
   <p>Hum . No ; but if a servant has grown bald under his master 's nose , it looks as if there was honesty on one side , and regard for it on the other .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Why , to be sure , old Humphrey , you are as honest as a — pshaw ! the parson means to palaver us ; but , to return to my position , I tell you I do  n't like your flat contradiction .</p>
   <p>Hum . Yes , you do .</p>
   <p>Sir R. I tell you I do n't . I only love to hear men 's arguments . I hate their flummery .</p>
   <p>Hum . What do you call flummery ?</p>
   <p>Sir R. Flattery , blockhead ! a dish too often served up by paltry poor men to paltry rich ones .</p>
   <p>Hum . I never serve it up to you .</p>
   <p>Sir R. No , you give me a dish of a different description .</p>
   <p>Hum . Hem ! what is it ?</p>
   <p>Sir R. Sauerkraut , you old crab</p>
   <p>Hum . I have held you a stout tug at argument this many a year .</p>
   <p>Sir R. And yet I could never teach you a syllogism . Now mind , when a poor man assents to what a rich man says , I suspect he means to flatter him : now I am rich , and hate flattery . Ergo — when a poor man subscribes to my opinion , I hate him .</p>
   <p>Hum . That 's wrong .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Very well ; negatur ; now prove it .</p>
   <p>Hum . Put the case then , I am a poor man .</p>
   <p>Sir R. You a n't , you scoundrel . You know you shall never want while I have a shilling .</p>
   <p>Hum . Bless you !</p>
   <p>Sir R. Pshaw ! Proceed .</p>
   <p>Hum . Well , then , I am a poor — I must be a poor man now , or I never shall get on .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Well , get on , be a poor man .</p>
   <p>Hum . I am a poor man , and I argue with you , and convince you , you are wrong ; then you call yourself a blockhead , and I am of your opinion : now , that 's no flattery .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Why , no ; but when a man 's of the same opinion with me , he puts an end to the argument , and that puts an end to the conversation , and so I hate him for that . But where 's my nephew Frederic ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Been out these two hours .</p>
   <p>Sir R. An undutiful cub ! Only arrived from Russia last night , and though I told him to stay at home till I rose , he 's scampering over the fields like a Calmuck Tartar .</p>
   <p>Hum . He 's a fine fellow .</p>
   <p>Sir R. He has a touch of our family . Do n't you think he is a little like me , Humphrey ?</p>
   <p>Hum . No , not a bit ; you are as ugly an old man as ever I clapped my eyes on .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Now that 's plaguy impudent , but there 's no flattery in it , and it keeps up the independence of argument . His father , my brother Job , is of as tame a spirit — Humphrey , you remember my brother Job ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Yes , you drove him to Russia five and twenty years ago .</p>
   <p>Sir R. I did not drive him .</p>
   <p>Hum . Yes , you did . You would never let him be at peace in the way of argument .</p>
   <p>Sir R. At peace ! Zounds , he would never go to war .</p>
   <p>Hum . He had the merit to be calm .</p>
   <p>Sir R. So has a duck pond . He was a bit of still life ; a chip ; weak water gruel ; a tame rabbit , boiled to rags , without sauce or salt . He received my arguments with his mouth open , like a poorbox gaping for half-pence , and , good or bad , he swallowed them all without any resistance . We could  n't disagree , and so we parted .</p>
   <p>Hum . And the poor , meek gentleman went to Russia for a quiet life .</p>
   <p>Sir R. A quiet life ! Why , he married the moment he got there , tacked himself to the shrew relict of a Russian merchant , and continued a speculation with her in furs , flax , potashes , tallow , linen , and leather ; what 's the consequence ? Thirteen months ago he broke .</p>
   <p>Hum . Poor soul , his wife should have followed the business for him . Sir R. I fancy she did follow it , for she died just as he broke , and now this madcap , Frederic , is sent over to me for protection . Poor Job , now he is in distress , I must not neglect his son .</p>
   <p>Hum . Here comes his son ; that 's Mr. Frederic .</p>
   <p>Enter FREDERIC .</p>
   <p>Fred . Oh , my dear uncle , good morning ! Your park is nothing but beauty .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Sir R. Who bid you caper over my beauty ? I told you to stay in doors till</l>
     <l n="2">I got up .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Fred . So you did , but I entirely forgot it .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="4">Sir R. And pray , what made you forget it ?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="5">Fred . The sun .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="6">Sir R. The sun ! he 's mad ; you mean the moon , 1 believe .</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Fred . Oh , my dear uncle , you do n't know the effect of a fine spring morning upon a fellow just arrived from Russia . The day looked bright , trees budding , birds singing , the park was so gay that I took a leap out of your old balcony , made your deer fly before me like the wind , and chased them all around the park to get an appetite for breakfast , while you were snoring in bed , uncle .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Oh , oh ! So the effect of English sunshine upon a Russian , is to make him jump out of a balcony , and worry my deer .</p>
   <p>Fred . I confess it had that influence upon me .</p>
   <p>Sir R. You had better be influenced by a rich old uncle , unless you think the sun likely to leave you a fat legacy .</p>
   <p>Fred . I hate legacies .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Sir , that 's mighty singular . They are pretty solid tokens , at least .</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">Fred . Very melancholy tokens , uncle ; they are the posthumous dispatches</l>
     <l n="2">Affection sends to Gratitude , to inform us we have lost a gracious friend .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="3">Sir R. How charmingly the dog argues !</l>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Fred . But I own my spirits ran away with me this morning . I will obey you better in future ; for they tell me you are a very worthy , good sort of old gentleman .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Now who had the familiar impudence to tell you that ? Fred . Old rusty , there .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Why Humphrey , you did n't ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Yes , but I did though .</p>
   <p>Fred , Yes , he did , and on that score I shall be anxious to show you obedience , for ‘ t is as meritorious to attempt sharing a good man 's heart , as it is paltry to have designs upon a rich man 's money . A noble nature aims its attentions full breast high , uncle ; a mean mind levels its dirty assiduities at the pocket .</p>
   <p>Sir R. ( Shaking him by the hand . ) Jump out of every window I have in my house ; hunt my deer into high fevers , my fine fellow ! Ay , that 's right . This is spunk , and plain speaking . Give me a man who is always flinging his dissent to my doctrines smack in my teeth .</p>
   <p>Fred . I disagree with you there , uncle .</p>
   <p>Hum . And so do I .</p>
   <p>Fred . You ! you forward puppy ! If you were not so old , I 'd knock you down .</p>
   <p>Sir R. I 'll knock you down , if you do . I wo n't have my servants thumped into dumb flattery .</p>
   <p>Hum . Come , you are ruffled . Let us go to the business of the morning .</p>
   <p>Sir R. I hate the business of the morning . Do n't you see we are engaged in discussion . I tell you , I hate the business of the morning .</p>
   <p>Hum . No you do n't .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Do n't I ? Why not ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Because ‘ t is charity .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Pshaw ! Well , we must not neglect the business , if there be any distress in the parish . Read the list , Humphrey .</p>
   <p>Hum . ( Taking out a paper and reading . ) “ Jonathan Huggins , of Muck Mead , is put in prison for debt . ”</p>
   <p>Sir R. Why , it was only last week that Gripe , the attorney , recovered two cottages for him by law , worth sixty pounds .</p>
   <p>Hum . Yes , and charged a hundred for his trouble ; so seized the cottages for part of his bill , and threw Jonathan into jail for the remainder .</p>
   <p>Sir R. A harpy ! I must relieve the poor fellow 's distress .</p>
   <p>Fred . And I must kick his attorney .</p>
   <p>Hum . ( Reading . ) “ The curate 's horse is dead . ”</p>
   <p>Sir R. Pshaw ! There 's no distress in that .</p>
   <p>Hum . Yes , there is , to a man that must go twenty miles every Sunday to preach three sermons , for thirty pounds a year .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Why wo n't the vicar give him another nag ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Because ‘ t is cheaper to get another curate ready mounted .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Well , send him the black pad which I purchased last Tuesday , and tell him to work him as long as he lives . What else have we upon the list ?</p>
   <p>Hum . Something out of the common ; there 's one Lieutenant Worthington , a disabled officer and a widower , come to lodge at Farmer Harrowby 's , in the village ; he is , it seems , very poor , and more proud than poor , and more honest than proud .</p>
   <p>Sir R. And so he sends to me for assistance ? Hum . He 'd see you hanged first ! No , he 'd sooner die than ask you or any man for a shilling ! There 's his daughter , and his wife 's aunt , and an old corporal that served in the wars with him , he keeps them all upon his half pay .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Starves them all , I 'm afraid , Humphrey .</p>
   <p>Fred . ( Going . ) Good morning , uncle .</p>
   <p>Sir R. You rogue , where are you running now ?</p>
   <p>Fred . To talk with Lieutenant Worthington .</p>
   <p>Sir R. And what may you be going to say to him ?</p>
   <p>Fred . I can n't tell till I encounter him ; and then , uncle , when I have an old gentleman by the hand , who has been disabled in his country 's service , and is struggling to support his motherless child , a poor relation , and a faithful servant , in honorable indigence , impulse will supply me with words to express my sentiments .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Stop , you rogue ; I must be before you in this business .</p>
   <p>Fred . That depends on who can run the fastest ; so , start fair , uncle , and here goes .— ( Runs out . )</p>
   <p>Sir R. Stop , stop ; why , Frederic — a jackanapes — to take my department out of my hands ! I 'll disinherit the dog for his assurance .</p>
   <p>Hum . No , you wo n't .</p>
   <p>Sir R. Wo n't I ? Hang me if I — but we 'll argue that point as we go . So , come along Humphrey .</p>

    <head>LXXXIV . MY MOTHER 'S PICTURE . ( 310 )</head>
    <head>William Cowper , 1731-1800 , was the son of an English clergyman ; both his parents were descended from noble families . He was always of a gentle , timid disposition ; and the roughness of his schoolfellows increased his weakness in this respect . He studied law , and was admitted to the bar , but never practiced his profession . When he was about thirty years of age , he was appointed to a clerkship in the House of Lords , but could not summon courage to enter upon the discharge of its duties . He was so disturbed by this affair that he became insane , sought to destroy himself , and had to be consigned to a private asylum . Soon after his recovery , he found a congenial home in the family of the Rev . Mr. Unwin . On the death of this gentleman , a few years later , he continued to reside with his widow till her death , a short time before that of Cowper . Most of this time their home was at Olney . His first writings were published in 1782 . He wrote several beautiful hymns , “ The Task , ” and some minor poems . These , with his translations of Homer and his correspondence , make up his published works . His life was always pure and gentle ; he took great pleasure in simple , natural objects , and in playing with animals . His insanity returned from time to time , and darkened his life at its close . When six years of age , he lost his mother ; and the following selection is part of a touching tribute to her memory , written many years later . ###</head>

   <p>LXXXV . DEATH OF SAMSON . ( 312 )</p>
   <p>John Milton , 1608-1674 , was born in London — eight years before the greatest English poet , Shakespeare , died . His father followed the profession of a scrivener , in which he acquired a competence . As a boy , Milton was exceedingly studious , continuing his studies till midnight . He graduated at Christ 's College , Cambridge , where his singular beauty , his slight figure , and his fastidious morality caused his companions to nickname him “ the lady of Christ 's . ” On leaving college he spent five years more in study , and produced his lighter poems . He then traveled on the continent , returning about the time the civil war broke out . For a time he taught a private school , but soon threw himself with all the power of his able and tried pen into the political struggle . He was the champion of Parliament and of Cromwell for about twenty years . On the accession of Charles II ., he concealed himself for a time , but was soon allowed to live quietly in London . His eyesight had totally failed in 1654 ; but now , in blindness , age , family affliction , and comparative poverty , he produced his great work “ Paradise Lost . ” In 1667 he sold the poem for 5 Pounds in cash , with a promise of 10 Pounds more on certain contingencies ; the sum total received by himself and family for the immortal poem , was 23 Pounds . Later , he produced “ Paradise Regained ” and “ Samson Agonistes , ” from the latter of which the following extract is taken . Milton is a wonderful example of a man , who , by the greatness of his own mind , triumphed over trials , afflictions , hardships , and the evil influence of bitter political controversy . ###</p>

     <l n="1">Occasions drew me early to this city ;</l>
     <l n="2">And , as the gates I entered with sunrise ,</l>
     <l n="3">The morning trumpets festival proclaimed</l>
     <l n="4">Through each high street : little I had dispatched ,</l>
     <l n="5">When all abroad was rumored that this day</l>
     <l n="6">Samson should be brought forth , to show the people</l>
     <l n="7">Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games .</l>
     <l n="8">I sorrowed at his captive state ,</l>
     <l n="9">But minded not to be absent at that spectacle .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">The building was a spacious theater</l>
     <l n="11">Half-round , on two main pillars vaulted high ,</l>
     <l n="12">With seats where all the lords , and each degree</l>
     <l n="13">Of sort , might sit in order to behold ;</l>
     <l n="14">The other side was open , where the throng</l>
     <l n="15">On banks and scaffolds under sky might stand :</l>
     <l n="16">I among these aloof obscurely stood .</l>
     <l n="17">The feast and noon grew high , and sacrifice</l>
     <l n="18">Had filled their hearts with mirth , high cheer , and wine ,</l>
     <l n="19">When to their sports they turned . Immediately</l>
     <l n="20">Was Samson as a public servant brought ,</l>
     <l n="21">In their state livery clad : before him pipes</l>
     <l n="22">And timbrels ; on each side went arme 'd guards ;</l>
     <l n="23">Both horse and foot before him and behind ,</l>
     <l n="24">Archers and slingers , cataphracts , and spears .</l>
     <l n="25">At sight of him the people with a shout</l>
     <l n="26">Rifted the air , clamoring their god with praise ,</l>
     <l n="27">Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="28">He , patient , but undaunted , where they led him ,</l>
     <l n="29">Came to the place ; and what was set before him ,</l>
     <l n="30">Which without help of eye might be essayed ,</l>
     <l n="31">To heave , pull , draw , or break , he still performed</l>
     <l n="32">All with incredible , stupendous force ,</l>
     <l n="33">None daring to appear antagonist .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">At length for intermission sake , they led him</l>
     <l n="35">Between the pillars ; he his guide requested ,</l>
     <l n="36">As overtired , to let him lean awhile</l>
     <l n="37">With both his arms on those two massy pillars ,</l>
     <l n="38">That to the arche 'd roof gave main support .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="39">He unsuspicious led him ; which when Samson</l>
     <l n="40">Felt in his arms , with head awhile inclined ,</l>
     <l n="41">And eyes fast fixed , he stood , as one who prayed ,</l>
     <l n="42">Or some great matter in his mind revolved :</l>
     <l n="43">At last , with head erect , thus cried aloud :—</l>
     <l n="44">“ Hitherto , lords , what your commands imposed</l>
     <l n="45">I have performed , as reason was , obeying ,</l>
     <l n="46">Not without wonder or delight beheld ;</l>
     <l n="47">Now , of my own accord , such other trial</l>
     <l n="48">I mean to show you of my strength yet greater ,</l>
     <l n="49">As with amaze shall strike all who behold . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="50">This uttered , straining all his nerves , he bowed ;</l>
     <l n="51">As with the force of winds and waters pent</l>
     <l n="52">When mountains tremble , those two massy pillars</l>
     <l n="53">With horrible convulsion to and fro</l>
     <l n="54">He tugged , he shook , till down they came , and drew</l>
     <l n="55">The whole roof after them with burst of thunder</l>
     <l n="56">Upon the heads of all who sat beneath ,—</l>
     <l n="57">Lords , ladies , captains , counselors , or priests ,</l>
     <l n="58">Their choice nobility and flower , not only</l>
     <l n="59">Of this , but each Philistian city round ,</l>
     <l n="60">Met from all parts to solemnize this feast .</l>
     <l n="61">Samson , with these immixed , inevitably</l>
     <l n="62">Pulled down the same destruction on himself ;</l>
     <l n="63">The vulgar only ‘ scaped who stood without .</l>
    </lg>

   <p>NOTE .— The person supposed to be speaking is a Hebrew who chanced to be present at Gaza when the , incidents related took place . After the catastrophe he rushes to Manoah , the father of Samson , to whom and his assembled friends he relates what he saw . ( Cf . Bible , Judges xvi , 23 . )</p>
   <p>LXXXVI . AN EVENING ADVENTURE . ( 315 )</p>
   <p>Not long since , a gentleman was traveling in one of the counties of Virginia , and about the close of the day stopped at a public house to obtain refreshment and spend the night . He had been there but a short time , before an old man alighted from his gig , with the apparent intention of becoming his fellow guest at the same house .</p>
   <p>As the old man drove up , he observed that both the shafts of his gig were broken , and that they were held together by withes , formed from the bark of a hickory sapling . Our traveler observed further that he was plainly clad , that his knee buckles were loosened , and that something like negligence pervaded his dress . Conceiving him to be one of the honest yeomanry of our land , the courtesies of strangers passed between them , and they entered the tavern . It was about the same time , that an addition of three or four young gentlemen was made to their number ; most , if not all of them , of the legal profession .</p>
   <p>As soon as they became conveniently accommodated , the conversation was turned , by one of the latter , upon the eloquent harangue which had that day been displayed at the bar . It was replied by the other that he had witnessed , the same day , a degree of eloquence no doubt equal , but it was from the pulpit . Something like a sarcastic rejoinder was made as to the eloquence of the pulpit , and a warm and able altercation ensued , in which the merits of the Christian religion became the subject of discussion . From six o'clock until eleven , the young champions wielded the sword of argument , adducing with ingenuity and ability everything that could be said pro and con .</p>
   <p>During this protracted period , the old gentleman listened with the meekness and modesty of a child , as if he were adding new information to the stores of his own mind ; or perhaps he was observing , with a philosophic eye , the faculties of the youthful mind , and how new energies are evolved by repeated action ; or perhaps , with patriotic emotion , he was reflecting upon the future destinies of his country , and on the rising generation , upon whom those future destinies must devolve ; or , most probably , with a sentiment of moral and religious feeling , he was collecting an argument which no art would be “ able to elude , and no force to resist . ” Our traveler remained a spectator , and took no part in what was said .</p>
   <p>At last one of the young men , remarking that it was impossible to combat with long and established prejudices , wheeled around , and with some familiarity exclaimed , “ Well , my old gentleman , what think you of these things ? ” “ If , ” said the traveler , “ a streak of vivid lightning had at that moment crossed the room , their amazement could not have been greater than it was from what followed . ” The most eloquent and unanswerable appeal that he had ever heard or read , was made for nearly an hour by the old gentleman . So perfect was his recollection , that every argument urged against the Christian religion was met in the order in which it was advanced . Hume 's sophistry on the subject of miracles , was , if possible , more perfectly answered than it had already been done by Campbell . And in the whole lecture there was so much simplicity and energy , pathos and sublimity , that not another word was uttered .</p>
   <p>“ An attempt to describe it , ” said the traveler , “ would be an attempt to paint the sunbeams . ” It was now a matter of curiosity and inquiry who the old gentleman was . The traveler concluded that it was the preacher from whom the pulpit eloquence was heard ; but no , it was John Marshall , the Chief Justice of the United States .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— David Hume ( b . 1711 , d. 1776 ) was a celebrated Scotch historian and essayist . His most important work is “ The History of England . ” He was a skeptic in matters of religion , and was a peculiarly subtle writer .</p>
   <p>George Campbell ( b . 1719 , d. 1796 ) was a distinguished Scotch minister . He wrote “ A Dissertation on Miracles , ” ably answering Hume 's “ Essay on Miracles . ”</p>
   <p>John Marshall ( b . 1755 , d. 1835 ) was Chief Justice of the United States from 1801 until his death . He was an eminent jurist , and wrote a “ Life of Washington , ” which made him famous as an author .</p>

    <head>LXXXVII . THE BAREFOOT BOY . ( 317 )</head>
    <head>John Greenleaf Whittier , 1807-1892 , was born in Haverhill , Mass ., and , with short intervals of absence , he always resided in that vicinity . His parents were Friends or “ Quakers , ” and he always held to the same faith . He spent his boyhood on a farm , occasionally writing verses for the papers even then . Two years of study in the academy seem to have given him all the special opportunity for education that he ever enjoyed . In 1829 he edited a newspaper in Boston , and the next year assumed a similar position in Hartford . For two years he was a member of the Massachusetts legislature . In 1836 he edited an anti-slavery paper in Philadelphia , and was secretary of the American Anti-Slavery Society . Mr. Whittier wrote extensively both in prose and verse . During the later years of his life he published several volumes of poems , and contributed frequently to the pages of the “ Atlantic Monthly . ” An earnest opponent of slavery , some of his poems bearing on that subject are fiery and even bitter ; but , in general , their sentiment is gentle , and often pathetic . As a poet , he took rank among those most highly esteemed by his countrymen . “ Snow-Bound , ” published in 1805 , is one of the longest and best of his poems . Several of his shorter pieces are marked by much smoothness and sweetness . ###</head>

     <head>LXXXIX . THE FOLLY OF INTOXICATION . ( 322 )</head>
     <lg type="stanza" n="6">
      <l n="27">Iago . What , are you hurt , lieutenant ?</l>
      <l n="28">Cassio . Ay , past all surgery .</l>
      <l n="29">Iago . Marry , heaven forbid !</l>
      <l n="30">Cas . Reputation , reputation , reputation ! Oh , I have</l>
      <l n="31">lost my reputation ! I have lost the immortal part of myself ,</l>
      <l n="32">and what remains is bestial . My reputation ! Iago , my reputation !</l>
     </lg>
    </lg>
   </lg>
   <p>Iago . As I am an honest man , I thought you had received some bodily wound ; there is more sense in that than in reputation . Reputation is an idle and most false imposition : oft got without merit , and lost without deserving : you have lost no reputation at all , unless you repute yourself such a loser . What , man ! there are ways to recover the general again . Sue to him again , and he 's yours .</p>
   <p>Cas . I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer . Drunk ? and speak parrot ? and squabble ? swagger ? swear ? and discourse fustian with one 's own shadow ? O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !</p>
   <p>Iago . What was he that you followed with your sword ? What had he done to you ?</p>
   <p>Cas . I know not .</p>
   <p>Iago . Is't possible ?</p>
   <p>Cas . I remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly ; a quarrel , but nothing wherefore . Oh that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains ! that we should , with joy , revel , pleasure , and applause , transform ourselves into beasts !</p>
   <p>Iago . Why , but you are now well enough : how came you thus recovered ?</p>
   <p>Cas . It hath pleased the devil , Drunkenness , to give place to the devil , Wrath ; one unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .</p>
   <p>Iago . Come , you are too severe a moraler . As the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , I could heartily wish this had not befallen ; but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .</p>
   <p>Cas . I will ask him for my place again : he shall tell me I am a drunkard ! Had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all . To be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast ! Oh strange !— Every inordinate cup is unblessed , and the ingredient is a devil ! Iago . Come , come ; good wine is a good familiar creature , if it be well used ; exclaim no more against it . And , good lieutenant , I think you think I love you .</p>
   <p>Cas . I have well approved it , sir ,— I , drunk !</p>
   <p>Iago . You or any man living may be drunk at a time , man . I 'll tell you what you shall do . Our general 's wife is now the general . Confess yourself freely to her ; importune her help to put you in your place again . She is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested . This broken joint between you and her husband , entreat her to splinter ; and , my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .</p>
   <p>Cas . You advise me well .</p>
   <p>Iago . I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .</p>
   <p>Cas . I think it freely , and betimes in the morning , I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me ; I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here .</p>
   <p>Iago . You are in the right . Good night , lieutenant , I must to the watch .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">Cas . Good night , honest Iago .</l>

   </lg>
   <p>NOTES .— Iago is represented as a crafty , unscrupulous villain . He applies for the position of lieutenant under Othello , but the latter has already appointed Cassio — who is honest , but of a weak character — to that position ; he , however , makes Iago his ensign . Then Iago , to revenge himself for this and other fancied wrongs , enters upon a systematic course of villainy , part of which is to bring about the intoxication of Cassio , and his consequent discharge from the lieutenancy .</p>
   <p>The Hydra was a fabled monster of Grecian mythology , having nine heads , one of which was immortal .</p>
   <p>Desdemona was the wife of Othello .</p>
   <p>XC . STARVED ROCK . ( 325 )</p>
   <p>Francis Parkman , 1823-1893 , the son of a clergyman of the same name , was born in Boston , and graduated at Harvard University in 1844 . He spent more than twenty years in a careful study of the early French explorations and settlements in America ; and he published the fruits of his labor in twelve large volumes . Although troubled with an affection of the eyes , which sometimes wholly prevented reading or writing , his work was most carefully and successfully done . His narratives are written in a clear and animated style , and his volumes are a rich contribution to American history . ###</p>
   <p>The cliff called “ Starved Rock , ” now pointed out to travelers as the chief natural curiosity of the region , rises , steep on three sides as a castle wall , to the height of a hundred and twenty-five feet above the river . In front , it overhangs the water that washes its base ; its western brow looks down on the tops of the forest trees below ; and on the east lies a wide gorge , or ravine , choked with the mingled foliage of oaks , walnuts , and elms ; while in its rocky depths a little brook creeps down to mingle with the river .</p>
   <p>From the rugged trunk of the stunted cedar that leans forward from the brink , you may drop a plummet into the river below , where the catfish and the turtles may plainly be seen gliding over the wrinkled sands of the clear and shallow current . The cliff is accessible only from the south , where a man may climb up , not without difficulty , by a steep and narrow passage . The top is about an acre in extent .</p>
   <p>Here , in the month of December , 1682 , La Salle and Tonty began to entrench themselves . They cut away the forest that crowned the rock , built storehouses and dwellings of its remains , dragged timber up the rugged pathway , and encircled the summit with a palisade . Thus the winter was passed , and meanwhile the work of negotiation went prosperously on . The minds of the Indians had been already prepared . In La Salle they saw their champion against the Iroquois , the standing terror of all this region . They gathered around his stronghold like the timorous peasantry of the Middle Ages around the rock-built castle of their feudal lord .</p>
   <p>From the wooden ramparts of St. Louis ,— for so he named his fort ,— high and inaccessible as an eagle 's nest , a strange scene lay before his eye . The broad , flat valley of the Illinois was spread beneath him like a map , bounded in the distance by its low wall of wooded hills . The river wound at his feet in devious channels among islands bordered with lofty trees ; then , far on the left , flowed calmly westward through the vast meadows , till its glimmering blue ribbon was lost in hazy distance .</p>
   <p>There had been a time , and that not remote , when these fair meadows were a waste of death and desolation , scathed with fire , and strewn with the ghastly relics of an Iroquois victory . Now , all was changed . La Salle looked down from his rock on a concourse of wild human life . Lodges of bark and rushes , or cabins of logs , were clustered on the open plain , or along the edges of the bordering forests . Squaws labored , warriors lounged in the sun , naked children whooped and gamboled on the grass .</p>
   <p>Beyond the river , a mile and a half on the left , the banks were studded once more with the lodges of the Illinois , who , to the number of six thousand , had returned , since their defeat , to this their favorite dwelling place . Scattered along the valley , among the adjacent hills , or over the neighboring prairie , were the cantonments of a half score of other tribes , and fragments of tribes , gathered under the protecting aegis of the French .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— The curious elevation called Starved Rock is on the south side of Illinois River , between La Salle and Ottawa . There is a legend according to which it is said that over one hundred years ago , a party of Illinois Indians took refuge here from the Pottawatomies ; their besiegers , however , confined them so closely that the whole party perished of starvation , or , as some say , of thirst . From this circumstance the rock takes its name .</p>
   <p>La Salle ( b . 1643 , d. 1687 ) was a celebrated French explorer and fur trader . He established many forts throughout the Mississippi Valley ,— among them , Fort St. Louis , in 1683 .</p>
   <p>Tonty was an Italian , who formerly served in both the French army and navy , and afterwards joined La Salle in his explorations .</p>

   <p>Falstaff . A plague of all cowards , I say , and a vengeance too ! marry , and amen ! Give me a cup of sack , boy . Ere I lead this life long , I 'll sew nether stocks , and mend them , and foot them , too . A plague of all cowards ! Give me a cup of sack , rogue . Is there no virtue extant ? ( He drinks , and then continues . ) You rogue , here 's lime in this sack , too ; there is nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man : yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it . A villainous coward ! Go thy ways , old Jack ; die when thou wilt : if manhood , good manhood , be not forgot upon the face of the earth , then am I a shotten herring . There live not three good men unhanged , in England ; and one of them is fat and grows old ; a bad world , I say ! I would I were a weaver ; I could sing psalms , or anything . A plague of all cowards , I say still .</p>
   <p>Prince Henry . How now , woolsack ? What mutter you ?</p>
   <p>Fal . A king 's son ! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath , and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese , I 'll never wear hair on my face more . You , Prince of Wales !</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Why , you baseborn dog ! What 's the matter ?</p>
   <p>Fal . Are you not a coward ? Answer me to that ; and Poins there ?</p>
   <p>Poins . Ye fat braggart , an ye call me coward , I 'll stab thee .</p>
   <p>Fal . I call thee coward ? I 'll see thee gibbeted ere I call thee coward : but I would give a thousand pounds I could run as fast as thou canst . You are straight enough in the shoulders , you care not who sees your back : call you that backing of your friends ? A plague upon such backing ! Give me them that will face me . Give me a cup of sack . I am a rogue , if I have drunk to-day .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . O villain ! thy lips ate scarce wiped since thou drunkest last .</p>
   <p>Fal . All 's one for that . A plague of all cowards , still say 1 . ( He drinks . )</p>
   <p>P. Henry . What 's the matter ?</p>
   <p>Fal . What 's the matter ! There be four of us here have ta'en a thousand pounds this morning .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Where is it , Jack ? where is it ?</p>
   <p>Fal . Where is it ? Taken from us it is ; a hundred upon poor four of us .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . What ! a hundred , man ?</p>
   <p>Fal . I am a rogue , if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together . I have ‘ scaped by miracle . I am eight times thrust through the doublet ; four , through the hose ; my buckler cut through and through ; my sword hacked like a handsaw ; look here ! ( shows his sword . ) I never dealt better since I was a man ; all would not do . A plague of all cowards ! Let them speak ( pointing to GADSHILL , BARDOLPH , and PETO ) ; if they speak more or less than truth , they are villains and the sons of darkness .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Speak , sirs ; how was it ?</p>
   <p>Gadshill . We four set upon some dozen —</p>
   <p>Fal . Sixteen , at least , my lord .</p>
   <p>Gad . And bound them .</p>
   <p>Peta . No , no , they were not bound .</p>
   <p>Fal . You rogue , they were bound , every man of them ; or I am a Jew , else — an Ebrew Jew .</p>
   <p>Gad . As we were sharing , some six or seven fresh men set upon us —</p>
   <p>Fal . And unbound the rest ; and then come in the other .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . What ! fought ye with them all ?</p>
   <p>Fal . All ? I know not what ye call all ; but if I fought not with fifty of them , I am a bunch of radish : if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack , then I am no two-legged creature .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Pray heaven , you have not murdered some of them .</p>
   <p>Fal . Nay , that 's past praying for ; for I have peppered two of them ; two I am sure I have paid ; two rogues in buckram suits . I tell thee what , Hal , if I tell thee a lie , spit in my face , and call me a horse . Thou knowest my old ward ; ( he draws his sword and stands if about to fight ) here I lay , and thus I bore my point . Four rogues in buckram let drive at me —</p>
   <p>P. Henry . What ! four ? Thou saidst but two even now .</p>
   <p>Fal . Four , Hal ; I told thee four .</p>
   <p>Poins . Ay , ay , he said four .</p>
   <p>Fal . These four came all afront , and mainly thrust at me . I made no more ado , but took all their seven points in my target , thus .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Seven ? Why , there were but four , even now .</p>
   <p>Fal . In buckram ?</p>
   <p>Poins . Ay , four , in buckram suits .</p>
   <p>Fal . Seven , by these hilts , or I am a villain else .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Prithee , let him alone ; we shall have more anon .</p>
   <p>Fal . Dost thou hear me , Hal ?</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Ay , and mark thee , too , Jack .</p>

   <p>Fal . Their points being broken , began to give me ground ; but I followed me close , came in foot and hand ; and , with a thought , seven of the eleven I paid .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . O , monstrous ! eleven buckram men grown out of two !</p>
   <p>Fal . But three knaves , in Kendal green , came at my back , and let drive at me ; for it was so dark , Hal , that thou couldst not see thy hand .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . These lies are like the father of them ; gross as a mountain , open , palpable . Why , thou clay-brained , nott-pated fool ; thou greasy tallow keech —</p>
   <p>Fal . What ! Art thou mad ! Art thou mad ? Is not the truth the truth ?</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Why , how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green , when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand ? Come , tell us your reason ; what sayest thou to this ?</p>
   <p>Poins . Come , your reason , Jack , your reason .</p>
   <p>Fal . What , upon compulsion ? No , were I at the strappado , or all the racks in the world , I would not tell you on compulsion . Give you a reason on compulsion ! If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries , I would give no man a reason on compulsion , I .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . I 'll be no longer guilty of this sin : this sanguine coward , this horseback breaker , this huge hill of flesh —</p>
   <p>Fal . Away ! you starveling , you eel skin , you dried neat 's tongue , you stockfish ! Oh for breath to utter what is like thee !— you tailor 's yard , you sheath , you bow case , you —</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Well , breathe awhile , and then to it again ; and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons , hear me speak but this .</p>
   <p>Poins . Mark , Jack .</p>
   <p>P. Henry . We two saw you four set on four ; you bound them , and were masters of their wealth . Mark now , how a plain tale shall put you down . Then did we two set on you four , and with a word outfaced you from your prize , and have it ; yea , and can show it you here in the house .— And , Falstaff , you carried yourself away as nimbly , with as quick dexterity , and roared for mercy , and still ran and roared , as ever I heard a calf . What a slave art thou , to hack thy sword as thou hast done , and then say it was in fight ! What trick , what device , what starting hole , canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame ?</p>
   <p>Poins . Come , let 's hear , Jack . What trick hast thou now ?</p>
   <p>Fal . Why , I knew ye as well as he that made ye . Why , bear ye , my masters : was it for me to kill the heir apparent ? Should I turn upon the true prince ? Why , thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules ; but beware instinct ; the lion will not touch the true prince ; instinct is a great matter ; I was a coward on instinct . I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life ; I for a valiant lion , and thou for a true prince . But , lads , I am glad you have the money . Hostess , clap to the doors . Watch to-night , pray to-morrow . Gallants , lads , boys , hearts of gold ; all the titles of good-fellowship come to you ! What ! shall we be merry ? Shall we have a play extempore ?</p>
   <p>P. Henry . Content ; and the argument shall be thy running away .</p>
   <p>Fal . Ah , no more of that , Hal , an thou lovest me !</p>

   <p>XCII . STUDIES . ( 332 )</p>
   <p>Sir Francis Bacon , 1561-1626 . This eminent man was the youngest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon , lord keeper of the seal in the early part of Elizabeth 's reign , and Anne Bacon , one of the most learned women of the time , daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke . He was born in London , and educated at Cambridge . He was a laborious and successful student , but even in his boyhood conceived a great distrust of the methods of study pursued at the seats of learning ,— methods which he exerted his great powers to correct in his maturer years . Much of his life was spent in the practice of law , in the discharge of the duties of high office , and as a member of Parliament ; but , to the end of life , he busied himself with philosophical pursuits , and he will be known to posterity chiefly for his deep and clear writings on these subjects . His constant direction in philosophy is to break away from assumption and tradition , and to be led only by sound induction based on a knowledge of observed phenomena . His “ Novum Organum ” and “ Advancement of Learning ” embody his ideas on philosophy and the true methods of seeking knowledge .</p>
   <p>Bacon rose to no very great distinction during the reign of Elizabeth ; but , under James I , he was promoted to positions of great honor and influence . In 1618 he was made Baron of Verulam ; and , three years later , he was made Viscount of St. Albans . During much of his life , Bacon was in pecuniary straits , which was doubtless one reason of his downfall ; for , in 1621 , he was accused of taking bribes , a charge to which he pleaded guilty . His disgrace followed , and he passed the last years of his life in retirement . Among the distinguished names in English literature , none stands higher in his department than that of Francis Bacon . ###</p>
   <p>Studies serve for delight , for ornament , and for ability . Their chief use for delight is in privateness , and retiring ; for ornament , is in discourse ; and for ability , is in the judgment and disposition of business ; for expert men can execute , and perhaps judge of the particulars , one by one ; but the general counsels , and the plots and marshaling of affairs , come best from those that are learned .</p>
   <p>To spend too much time in studies , is sloth ; to use them too much for ornament , is affectation ; to make judgment wholly by their rules , is the humor of a scholar ; they perfect nature and are perfected by experience — for natural abilities are like natural plants , that need pruning by study ; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large , except they be bounded in by experience . Crafty men contemn studies , simple men admire them , and wise men use them , for they teach not their own use ; but that is a wisdom without them , and above them , won by observation .</p>
   <p>Read not to contradict and confute , nor to believe and take for granted , nor to find talk and discourse , but to weigh and consider . Some books are to be tasted , others to be swallowed , and some few to be chewed and digested ; that is , some books are to be read only in parts ; others to be read , but not curiously ; and some few to be read wholly , and with diligence and attention . Some books also may he read by deputy , and extracts made of them by others ; but that would be only in the less important arguments , and the meaner sort of books ; else distilled books are like common distilled waters , flashy things .</p>
   <p>Reading maketh a full man , conference a ready man , and writing an exact man ; and , therefore , if a man write little , he had need have a great memory ; if he confer little , he had need have a present wit ; and if he read little , he had need have much cunning , to seem to know that he doth not . Histories make men wise ; poets , witty ; the mathematics , subtle ; natural philosophy , deep ; moral philosophy , grave ; logic and rhetoric , able to contend .</p>
   <p>XCIII . SURRENDER OF GRANADA . ( 334 )</p>
   <p>Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton , 1806-1873 , was born in Norfolk County , England . His father died when he was young ; his mother was a woman of strong literary tastes , and did much to form her son 's mind . In 1844 , by royal license , he took the surname of Lytton from his mother 's family . Bulwer graduated at Cambridge . He began to publish in 1826 , and his novels and plays followed rapidly . “ Pelham , ” “ The Caxtons , ” “ My Novel , ” “ What will he do with it ? ” and “ Kenelm Chillingly ” are among the best known of his numerous novels ; and “ The Lady of Lyons ” and “ Richelieu ” are his most successful plays . His novels are extensively read on the continent , and have been translated into most of the languages spoken there . “ Leila , or the Siege of Granada , ” from which this selection is adapted , was published in 1840 . ###</p>
   <p>Day dawned upon Granada , and the beams of the winter sun , smiling away the clouds of the past night , played cheerily on the murmuring waves of the Xenil and the Darro . Alone , upon a balcony commanding a view of the beautiful landscape , stood Boabdil , the last of the Moorish kings . He had sought to bring to his aid all the lessons of the philosophy he had cultivated .</p>
   <p>“ What are we , ” thought the musing prince , “ that we should fill the world with ourselves — we kings ? Earth resounds with the crash of my falling throne ; on the ear of races unborn the echo will live prolonged . But what have I lost ? Nothing that was necessary to my happiness , my repose : nothing save the source of all my wretchedness , the Marah of my life ! Shall I less enjoy heaven and earth , or thought or action , or man 's more material luxuries of food or sleep — the common and the cheap desires of all ? Arouse thee , then , O heart within me ! Many and deep emotions of sorrow or of joy are yet left to break the monotony of existence . . . . But it is time to depart . ” So saying , he descended to the court , flung himself on his barb , and , with a small and saddened train , passed through the gate which we yet survey , by a blackened and crumbling tower , overgrown with vines and ivy ; thence , amidst gardens now appertaining to the convent of the victor faith , he took his mournful and unwitnessed way .</p>
   <p>When he came to the middle of the hill that rises above those gardens , the steel of the Spanish armor gleamed upon him , as the detachment sent to occupy the palace marched over the summit in steady order and profound silence . At the head of this vanguard , rode , upon a snow-white palfrey , the Bishop of Avila , followed by a long train of barefooted monks . They halted as Boabdil approached , and the grave bishop saluted him with the air of one who addresses an infidel and inferior . With the quick sense of dignity common to the great , and yet more to the fallen , Boabdil felt , but resented not , the pride of the ecclesiastic . “ Go , Christian , ” said he , mildly , “ the gates of the Alhambra are open , and Allah has bestowed the palace and the city upon your king ; may his virtues atone the faults of Boabdil ! ” So saying , and waiting no answer , he rode on without looking to the right or the left . The Spaniards also pursued their way .</p>
   <p>The sun had fairly risen above the mountains , when Boabdil and his train beheld , from the eminence on which they were , the whole armament of Spain ; and at the same moment , louder than the tramp of horse or the clash of arms , was heard distinctly the solemn chant of Te Deum , which preceded the blaze of the unfurled and lofty standards . Boabdil , himself still silent , heard the groans and exclamations of his train ; he turned to cheer or chide them , and then saw , from his own watchtower , with the sun shining full upon its pure and dazzling surface , the silver cross of Spain . His Alhambra was already in the hands of the foe ; while beside that badge of the holy war waved the gay and flaunting flag of St. Iago , the canonized Mars of the chivalry of Spain . At that sight the King 's voice died within him ; he gave the rein to his barb , impatient to close the fatal ceremonial , and did not slacken his speed till almost within bowshot of the first ranks of the army .</p>
   <p>Never had Christian war assumed a more splendid and imposing aspect . Far as the eye could reach , extended the glittering and gorgeous lines of that goodly power , bristling with sunlit spears and blazoned banners ; while beside , murmured , and glowed , and danced , the silver and laughing Xenil , careless what lord should possess , for his little day , the banks that bloomed by its everlasting course . By a small mosque halted the flower of the army . Surrounded by the archpriests of that mighty hierarchy , the peers and princes of a court that rivaled the Rolands of Charlemagne , was seen the kingly form of Ferdinand himself , with Isabel at his right hand , and the highborn dames of Spain , relieving , with their gay colors and sparkling gems , the sterner splendor of the crested helmet and polished mail . Within sight of the royal group , Boabdil halted , composed his aspect so as best to conceal his soul , and , a little in advance of his scanty train , but never in mien and majesty more a king , the son of Abdallah met his haughty conqueror .</p>
   <p>At the sight of his princely countenance and golden hair , his comely and commanding beauty , made more touching by youth , a thrill of compassionate admiration ran through that assembly of the brave and fair . Ferdinand and Isabel slowly advanced to meet their late rival ,— their new subject ; and , as Boabdil would have dismounted , the Spanish king placed his hand upon his shoulder . “ Brother and prince , ” said he , “ forget thy sorrows ; and may our friendship hereafter console thee for reverses , against which thou hast contended as a hero and a king — resisting man , but resigned at length to God . ”</p>
   <p>Boabdil did not affect to return this bitter but unintentional mockery of compliment , He bowed his head , and remained a moment silent ; then motioning to his train , four of his officers approached , and , kneeling beside Ferdinand , proffered to him , upon a silver buckler , the keys of the city . “ O king ! ” then said Boabdil , “ accept the keys of the last hold which has resisted the arms of Spain ! The empire of the Moslem is no more . Thine are the city and the people of Granada ; yielding to thy prowess , they yet confide in thy mercy . ” “ They do well , ” said the king ; “ our promises shall not be broken . But since we know the gallantry of Moorish cavaliers , not to us , but to gentler hands , shall the keys of Granada be surrendered . ”</p>
   <p>Thus saying , Ferdinand gave the keys to Isabel , who would have addressed some soothing flatteries to Boabdil , but the emotion and excitement were too much for her compassionate heart , heroine and queen though she was ; and when she lifted her eyes upon the calm and pale features of the fallen monarch , the tears gushed from them irresistibly , and her voice died in murmurs . A faint flush overspread the features of Boabdil , and there was a momentary pause of embarrassment , which the Moor was the first to break .</p>
   <p>“ Fair queen , ” said he , with mournful and pathetic dignity , “ thou canst read the heart that thy generous sympathy touches and subdues ; this is thy last , nor least glorious conquest . But I detain ye ; let not my aspect cloud your triumph . Suffer me to say farewell . ” “ Farewell , my brother , ” replied Ferdinand , “ and may fair fortune go with you ! Forget the past ! ” Boabdil smiled bitterly , saluted the royal pair with profound and silent reverence , and rode slowly on , leaving the army below as he ascended the path that led to his new principality beyond the Alpuxarras . As the trees snatched the Moorish cavalcade from the view of the king , Ferdinand ordered the army to recommence its march ; and trumpet and cymbal presently sent their music to the ear of the Moslems .</p>
   <p>Boabdil spurred on at full speed , till his panting charger halted at the little village where his mother , his slaves , and his faithful wife , Amine — sent on before — awaited him . Joining these , he proceeded without delay upon his melancholy path . They ascended that eminence which is the pass into the Alpuxarras . From its height , the vale , the rivers , the spires , and the towers of Granada broke gloriously upon the view of the little band . They halted mechanically and abruptly ; every eye was turned to the beloved scene . The proud shame of baffled warriors , the tender memories of home , of childhood , of fatherland , swelled every heart , and gushed from every eye .</p>
   <p>Suddenly the distant boom of artillery broke from the citadel , and rolled along the sunlit valley and crystal river . A universal wail burst from the exiles ; it smote ,— it overpowered the heart of the ill-starred king , in vain seeking to wrap himself in Eastern pride or stoical philosophy . The tears gushed from his eyes , and he covered his face with his hands . The band wound slowly on through the solitary defiles ; and that place where the king wept is still called The Last Sigh of the Moor .</p>

   <p>Samuel Rogers , 1763-1855 , was the son of a London banker , and , in company with his father , followed the banking business for some years . He began to write at an early age , and published his “ Pleasures of Memory , ” perhaps his most famous work , in 1792 . The next year his father died , leaving him an ample fortune . He now retired from business and established himself in an elegant house in St. James 's Place . This house was a place of resort for literary men during fifty years . In 1822 he published his longest poem , “ Italy , ” after which he wrote but little . He wrote with care , spending , as he said , nine years on the “ Pleasures of Memory , ” and sixteen on “ Italy . ” “ His writings are remarkable for elegance of diction , purity of taste , and beauty of sentiment . ” It is said that he was very agreeable in conversation and manners , and benevolent in his disposition ; but he was addicted to ill-nature and satire in some of his criticisms . ###</p>

   <p>XCVI . INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES . ( 344 )</p>
   <p>John Caldwell Calhoun , 1782-1850 . This great statesman , and champion of southern rights and opinions , was born in Abbeville District , South Carolina . In the line of both parents , he was of Irish Presbyterian descent . In youth he was very studious , and made the best use of such opportunities for education as the frontier settlement afforded . He graduated at Yale College in 1804 , and studied law at Litchfield , Connecticut . In 1808 he was elected to the Legislature of South Carolina ; and , three years later , he was chosen to the National House of Representatives . During the six years that he remained in the House , he took an active and prominent part in the stirring events of the time . In 1817 he was appointed Secretary of War , and held the office seven years . From 1825 to 1832 he was Vice President of the United States . He then resigned this office , and took his seat as senator from South Carolina . In 1844 President Tyler called him to his Cabinet as Secretary of State ; and , in 1845 , he returned to the Senate , where he remained till his death . During all his public life Mr. Calhoun was active and outspoken . His earnestness and logical force commanded the respect of those who differed most widely from him in opinion . He took the most advanced ground in favor of “ State Rights , ” and defended slavery as neither morally nor politically wrong . His foes generally conceded his honesty , and respected his ability ; while his friends regarded him as little less than an oracle .</p>
   <p>In private life Mr. Calhoun was highly esteemed and respected . His home was at “ Fort Hill , ” in the northwestern district of South Carolina ; and here he spent all the time he could spare from his public duties , in the enjoyments of domestic life and in cultivating his plantation . In his home he was remarkable for kindness , cheerfulness , and sociability . ###</p>
   <p>To comprehend more fully the force and bearing of public opinion , and to form a just estimate of the changes to which , aided by the press , it will probably lead , politically and socially , it will be necessary to consider it in connection with the causes that have given it an influence so great as to entitle it to be regarded as a new political element . They will , upon investigation , be found in the many discoveries and inventions made in the last few centuries .</p>
   <p>All these have led to important results . Through the invention of the mariner 's compass , the globe has been circumnavigated and explored ; and all who inhabit it , with but few exceptions , are brought within the sphere of an all-pervading commerce , which is daily diffusing over its surface the light and blessings of civilization .</p>
   <p>Through that of the art of printing , the fruits of observation and reflection , of discoveries and inventions , with all the accumulated stores of previously acquired knowledge , are preserved and widely diffused . The application of gunpowder to the art of war has forever settled the long conflict for ascendency between civilization and barbarism , in favor of the former , and thereby guaranteed that , whatever knowledge is now accumulated , or may hereafter be added , shall never again be lost .</p>
   <p>The numerous discoveries and inventions , chemical and mechanical , and the application of steam to machinery , have increased many fold the productive powers of labor and capital , and have thereby greatly increased the number who may devote themselves to study and improvement , and the amount of means necessary for commercial exchanges , especially between the more and the less advanced and civilized portions of the globe , to the great advantage of both , but particularly of the latter .</p>
   <p>The application of steam to the purposes of travel and transportation , by land and water , has vastly increased the facility , cheapness , and rapidity of both : diffusing , with them , information and intelligence almost as quickly and as freely as if borne by the winds ; while the electrical wires outstrip them in velocity , rivaling in rapidity even thought itself .</p>
   <p>The joint effect of all this has been a great increase and diffusion of knowledge ; and , with this , an impulse to progress and civilization heretofore unexampled in the history of the world , accompanied by a mental energy and activity unprecedented .</p>
   <p>To all these causes , public opinion , and its organ , the press , owe their origin and great influence . Already they have attained a force in the more civilized portions of the globe sufficient to be felt by all governments , even the most absolute and despotic . But , as great as they now are , they have , as yet , attained nothing like their maximum force . It is probable that not one of the causes which have contributed to their formation and influence , has yet produced its full effect ; while several of the most powerful have just begun to operate ; and many others , probably of equal or even greater force , yet remain to be brought to light .</p>
   <p>When the causes now in operation have produced their full effect , and inventions and discoveries shall have been exhausted — if that may ever be — they will give a force to public opinion , and cause changes , political and social , difficult to be anticipated . What will be their final bearing , time only can decide with any certainty .</p>
   <p>That they will , however , greatly improve the condition of man ultimately , it would be impious to doubt ; it would be to suppose that the all-wise and beneficent Being , the Creator of all , had so constituted man as that the employment of the high intellectual faculties with which He has been pleased to endow him , in order that he might develop the laws that control the great agents of the material world , and make them subservient to his use , would prove to him the cause of permanent evil , and not of permanent good .</p>

    <head>XCVII . ENOCH ARDEN AT THE WINDOW . ( 347 )</head>
    <head>Alfred Tennyson , 1809-1892 , was born in Somerby , Lincolnshire , England ; his father was a clergyman noted for his energy and physical stature . Alfred , with his two older brothers , graduated at Trinity College , Cambridge . His first volume of poems appeared in 1830 ; it made little impression , and was severely treated by the critics . On the publication of his third series , in 1842 , his poetic genius began to receive general recognition . On the death of Wordsworth he was made poet laureate , and he was then regarded as the foremost living poet of England . “ In Memoriam , ” written in memory of his friend Arthur Hallam , appeared in 1850 ; the “ Idyls of the King , ” in 1858 ; and “ Enoch Arden , ” a touching story in verse , from which the following selection is taken , was published in 1864 . In 1883 he accepted a peerage as Baron Tennyson of Aldworth , Sussex , and of Freshwater , Isle of Wight . ###</head>

     <l n="5">At evening when the dull November day</l>
     <l n="6">Was growing duller twilight , to the hill .</l>
     <l n="7">There he sat down gazing on all below ;</l>

     <l n="18">Flourished a little garden , square and walled :</l>
     <l n="19">And in it throve an ancient evergreen ,</l>
     <l n="20">A yew tree , and all round it ran a walk</l>
     <l n="21">Of shingle , and a walk divided it :</l>
     <l n="22">But Enoch shunned the middle walk , and stole</l>

   <p>XCIX . SPEECH ON THE TRIAL OF A MURDERER . ( 352 )</p>
   <p>Against the prisoner at the bar , as an individual , I can not have the slightest prejudice . I would not do him the smallest injury or injustice . But I do not affect to be indifferent to the discovery and the punishment of this deep guilt . I cheerfully share in the opprobrium , how much soever it may be , which is cast on those who feel and manifest an anxious concern that all who had a part in planning , or a hand in executing this deed of midnight assassination , may be brought to answer for their enormous crime at the bar of public justice .</p>
   <p>This is a most extraordinary case . In some respects it has hardly a precedent anywhere ; certainly none in our New England history . This bloody drama exhibited no suddenly excited , ungovernable rage . The actors in it were not surprised by any lionlike temptation springing upon their virtue , and overcoming it before resistance could begin . Nor did they do the deed to glut savage vengeance , or satiate long-settled and deadly hate . It was a cool , calculating , money-making murder . It was all “ hire and salary , not revenge . ” It was the weighing of money against life ; the counting out of so many pieces of silver against so many ounces of blood .</p>
   <p>An aged man , without an enemy in the world , in his own house , and in his own bed , is made the victim of a butcherly murder for mere pay . Truly , here is a new lesson for painters and poets . Whoever shall hereafter draw the portrait of murder , if he will show it as it has been exhibited in an example , where such example was last to have been looked for , in the very bosom of our New England society , let him not give it the grim visage of Moloch , the brow knitted by revenge , the face black with settled hate , and the bloodshot eye emitting livid fires of malice . Let him draw , rather , a decorous , smooth-faced , bloodless demon ; a picture in repose , rather than in action ; not so much an example of human nature in its depravity , and in its paroxysms of crime , as an infernal nature , a fiend in the ordinary display and development of his character .</p>
   <p>The deed was executed with a degree of self-possession and steadiness equal to the wickedness with which it was planned . The circumstances , now clearly in evidence , spread out the whole scene before us . Deep sleep had fallen on the destined victim , and on all beneath his roof . A healthful old man , to whom sleep was sweet ,— the first sound slumbers of the night held him in their soft but strong embrace . The assassin enters through the window , already prepared , into an unoccupied apartment . With noiseless foot he paces the lonely hall , half-lighted by the moon ; he winds up the ascent of the stairs , and reaches the door of the chamber . Of this , he moves the lock by soft and continued pressure till it turns on its hinges without noise ; and he enters , and beholds his victim before him . The room was uncommonly open to the admission of light . The face of the innocent sleeper was turned from the murderer , and the beams of the moon , resting on the gray locks of his aged temple , showed him where to strike . The fatal blow is given ! and the victim passes , without a struggle or a motion , from the repose of sleep to the repose of death !</p>
   <p>It is the assassin 's purpose to make sure work ; and he yet plies the dagger , though it was obvious that life had been destroyed by the blow of the bludgeon . He even raises the aged arm , that he may not fail in his aim at the heart ; and replaces it again over the wounds of the poniard ! To finish the picture , he explores the wrist for the pulse ! He feels for it , and ascertains that it beats no longer ! It is accomplished . The deed is done . He retreats , retraces his steps to the window , passes out through it as he came in , and escapes . He has done the murder ; no eye has seen him , no ear has heard him . The secret is his own , and it is safe !</p>
   <p>Ah ! gentlemen , that was a dreadful mistake . Such a secret can be safe nowhere . The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner where the guilty can bestow it , and say it is safe . Not to speak of that eye which glances through all disguises , and beholds everything as in the splendor of noon ; such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection , even by men . True it is , generally speaking , that “ murder will out . ” True it is that Providence hath so ordained , and doth so govern things , that those who break the great law of Heaven by shedding man 's blood , seldom succeed in avoiding discovery . Especially , in a case exciting so much attention as this , discovery must come , and wilt come , sooner or later . A thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man , everything , every circumstance connected with the time and place ; a thousand ears catch every whisper ; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene , shedding all their light , and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a blaze of discovery .</p>
   <p>Meantime , the guilty soul can not keep its own secret . It is false to itself , or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself . It labors under its guilty possession , and knows not what to do with it . The human heart was not made for the residence of such an inhabitant . It finds itself preyed on by a torment , which it dares not acknowledge to God nor man . A vulture is devouring it , and it can ask no sympathy or assistance either from heaven or earth . The secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to possess him ; and , like the evil spirits of which we read , it overcomes him , and leads him whithersoever it will . He feels it beating at his heart , rising to his throat , and demanding disclosure . He thinks the whole world sees it in his face , reads it in his eyes , and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts . It has become his master . It betrays his discretion , it breaks down his courage , it conquers his prudence . When suspicions from without begin to embarrass him , and the net of circumstance to entangle him , the fatal secret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth . It must be confessed , it will be confessed ; there is no refuge from confession but suicide , and suicide is confession . — Daniel Webster .</p>
   <p>NOTE .— The above extract is from Daniel Webster 's argument in the trial of John F. Knapp for the murder of Mr. White , a very wealthy and respectable citizen of Salem , Mass , Four persons were arrested as being concerned in the conspiracy ; one confessed the plot and all the details of the crime , implicating the others , but he afterwards refused to testify in court . The man who , by this confession , was the actual murderer , committed suicide , and Mr. Webster 's assistance was obtained in prosecuting the others . John F. Knapp was convicted as principal , and the other two as accessaries in the murder .</p>

    <head>C. THE CLOSING YEAR . ( 355 )</head>
    <head>George Denison Prentice , 1802-1870 , widely known as a political writer , a poet , and a wit , was born in Preston , Connecticut , and graduated at Brown University in 1823 . He studied law , but never practiced his profession . He edited a paper in Hartford for two years ; and , in 1831 , he became editor of the “ Louisville Journal , ” which position he held for nearly forty years . As an editor , Mr. Prentice was an able , and sometimes bitter , political partisan , abounding in wit and satire ; as a poet , he not only wrote gracefully himself , but he did much by his kindness and sympathy to develop the poetical talents of others . Some who have since taken high rank , first became known to the world through the columns of the “ Louisville Journal . ” ###</head>

   <p>CI . A NEW CITY IN COLORADO . ( 358 )</p>
   <p>Helen Hunt Jackson , 1830-1885 , was the daughter of the late Professor Nathan W. Fiske , of Amherst College . She was born in Amherst , and educated at Ipswich , Massachusetts , and at New York . Mrs. Jackson was twice married . In the latter years of her life , she became deeply interested in the Indians , and wrote two books , “ Ramona , ” a novel , and “ A Century of Dishonor , ” setting forth vividly the wrongs to which the red race has been subjected . She had previously published several books of prose and poetry , less important but charming in their way . The following selection is adapted from “ Bits of Travel at Home . ” ###</p>
   <p>Garland City is six miles from Fort Garland . The road to it from the fort lies for the last three miles on the top of a sage-grown plateau . It is straight as an arrow , looks in the distance like a brown furrow on the pale gray plain , and seems to pierce the mountains beyond . Up to within an eighth of a mile of Garland City , there is no trace of human habitation . Knowing that the city must be near , you look in all directions for a glimpse of it ; the hills ahead of you rise sharply across your way . Where is the city ? At your very feet , but you do not suspect it .</p>
   <p>The sunset light was fading when we reached the edge of the ravine in which the city lies . It was like looking unawares over the edge of a precipice ; the gulch opened beneath us as suddenly as if the earth had that moment parted and made it . With brakes set firm , we drove cautiously down the steep road ; the ravine twinkled with lights , and almost seemed to flutter with white tents and wagon tops . At the farther end it widened , opening out on an inlet of the San Luis Park ; and , in its center , near this widening mouth , lay the twelve-days-old city . A strange din arose from it .</p>
   <p>“ What is going on ? ” we exclaimed . “ The building of the city , ” was the reply . “ Twelve days ago there was not a house here . To-day there are one hundred and five , and in a week more there will be two hundred ; each man is building his own home , and working day and night to get it done ahead of his neighbor . There are four sawmills going constantly , but they can n't turn out lumber half fast enough . Everybody has to be content with a board at a time . If it were not for that , there would have been twice as many houses done as there are . ”</p>
   <p>We drove on down the ravine . A little creek on our right was half hid in willow thickets . Hundreds of white tents gleamed among them : tents with poles ; tents made by spreading sailcloth over the tops of bushes ; round tents ; square tents ; big tents ; little tents ; and for every tent a camp fire ; hundreds of white-topped wagons , also , at rest for the night , their great poles propped up by sticks , and their mules and drivers lying and standing in picturesque groups around them .</p>
   <p>It was a scene not to be forgotten . Louder and louder sounded the chorus of the hammers as we drew near the center of the “ city ; ” more and more the bustle thickened ; great ox teams swaying unwieldily about , drawing logs and planks , backing up steep places ; all sorts of vehicles driving at reckless speed up and down ; men carrying doors ; men walking along inside of window sashes ,— the easiest way to carry them ; men shoveling ; men wheeling wheelbarrows ; not a man standing still ; not a man with empty hands ; every man picking up something , and running to put it down somewhere else , as in a play ; and , all the while , “ Clink ! clink ! clink ! ” ringing above the other sounds ,— the strokes of hundreds of hammers , like the “ Anvil Chorus . ”</p>
   <p>“ Where is Perry 's Hotel ? ” we asked . One of the least busy of the throng spared time to point to it with his thumb , as he passed us . In some bewilderment we drew up in front of a large unfinished house , through the many uncased apertures of which we could see only scaffoldings , rough boards , carpenters ’ benches , and heaps of shavings . Streams of men were passing in and out through these openings , which might be either doors or windows ; no steps led to any of them .</p>
   <p>“ Oh , yes ! oh , yes ! can accommodate you all ! ” was the landlord 's reply to our hesitating inquiries . He stood in the doorway of his dining-room ; the streams of men we had seen going in and out were the fed and the unfed guests of the house . It was supper time ; we also were hungry . We peered into the dining room : three tables full of men ; a huge pile of beds on the floor , covered with hats and coats ; a singular wall , made entirely of doors propped upright ; a triangular space walled off by sailcloth ,— this is what we saw . We stood outside , waiting among the scaffolding and benches . A black man was lighting the candles in a candelabrum made of two narrow bars of wood nailed across each other at right angles , and perforated with holes . The candles sputtered , and the hot fat fell on the shavings below .</p>
   <p>“ Dangerous way of lighting a room full of shavings , ” some one said . The landlord looked up at the swinging candelabra and laughed . “ Tried it pretty often , ” he said . “ Never burned a house down yet . ”</p>
   <p>I observed one peculiarity in the speech at Garland City . Personal pronouns , as a rule , were omitted ; there was no time for a superfluous word .</p>
   <p>“ Took down this house at Wagon Creek , ” he continued , “ just one week ago ; took it down one morning while the people were eating breakfast ; took it down over their heads ; putting it up again over their heads now . ”</p>
   <p>This was literally true . The last part of it we ourselves were seeing while he spoke , and a friend at our elbow had seen the Wagon Creek crisis .</p>
   <p>“ Waiting for that round table for you , ” said the landlord ; " ‘ ll bring the chairs out here 's fast 's they quit ‘ em . That 's the only way to get the table . ”</p>
   <p>So , watching his chances , as fast as a seat was vacated , he sprang into the room , seized the chair and brought it out to us ; and we sat there in our “ reserved seats , ” biding the time when there should be room enough vacant at the table for us to take our places .</p>
   <p>What an indescribable scene it was ! The strange-looking wall of propped doors which we had seen , was the impromptu , wall separating the bedrooms from the dining-room . Bedrooms ? Yes , five of them ; that is , five bedsteads in a row , with just space enough between them to hang up a sheet , and with just room enough between them and the propped doors for a moderate-sized person to stand upright if he faced either the doors or the bed . Chairs ? Oh , no ! What do you want of a chair in a bedroom which has a bed in it ? Washstands ? One tin basin out in the unfinished room . Towels ? Uncertain .</p>
   <p>The little triangular space walled off by the sailcloth was a sixth bedroom , quite private and exclusive ; and the big pile of beds on the dining-room floor was to be made up into seven bedrooms more between the tables , after everybody had finished supper .</p>
   <p>Luckily for us we found a friend here ,— a man who has been from the beginning one of Colorado 's chief pioneers ; and who is never , even in the wildest wilderness , without resources of comfort .</p>
   <p>“ You can n't sleep here , ” he said . “ I can do better for you than this . ”</p>
   <p>“ Better ! ”</p>
   <p>He offered us luxury . How movable a thing is one 's standard of comfort ! A two-roomed pine shanty , board walls , board floors , board ceilings , board partitions not reaching to the roof , looked to us that night like a palace . To have been entertained at Windsor Castle would not have made us half so grateful .</p>
   <p>It was late before the “ city ” grew quiet ; and , long after most of the lights were out , and most of the sounds had ceased , I heard one solitary hammer in the distance , clink , clink , clink . I fell asleep listening to it .</p>
   <p>CII . IMPORTANCE OF THE UNION . ( 362 )</p>
   <p>Mr. President : I am conscious of having detained you and the Senate much too long . I was drawn into the debate with no previous deliberation , such as is suited to the discussion of so grave and important a subject . But it is a subject of which my heart is full , and I have not been willing to suppress the utterance of its spontaneous sentiments . I can not , even now , persuade myself to relinquish it , without expressing once more my deep conviction , that , since it respects nothing less than the union of the states , it is of most vital and essential importance to the public happiness .</p>
   <p>I profess , sir , in my career hitherto , to have kept steadily in view the prosperity and honor of the whole country , and the preservation of our federal Union . It is to that Union we owe our safety at home , and our consideration and dignity abroad . It is to that Union that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us most proud of our country . That Union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues , in the severe school of adversity . It had its origin in the necessities of disordered finance , prostrate commerce , and ruined credit . Under its benign influences , these great interests immediately awoke , as from the dead , and sprang forth with newness of life . Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its blessings ; and , although our territory has stretched out wider and wider , and our population spread farther and farther , they have not outrun its protection or its benefits . It has been to us all a copious fountain of national , social , and personal happiness .</p>
   <p>I have not allowed myself , sir , to look beyond the Union , to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess behind . I have not coolly weighed the chances of preserving liberty , when the bonds that unite us together shall be broken asunder . I have not accustomed myself to hang over the precipice of disunion , to see whether , with my short sight , I can fathom the depth of the abyss below ; nor could I regard him as a safe counselor in the affairs of this government , whose thoughts should be mainly bent on considering , not how the Union should be best preserved , but how tolerable might be the condition of the people when it shall be broken up and destroyed .</p>
   <p>While the Union lasts , we have high , exciting , gratifying prospects spread out before us , for us and our children . Beyond that , I seek not to penetrate the veil . God grant that in my day , at least , that curtain may not rise . God grant that on my vision never may be opened what lies behind . When my eyes shall be turned to behold , for the last time , the sun in heaven , may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union ; on States dissevered , discordant , belligerent ; on a land rent with civil feuds , or drenched , it may be , in fraternal blood .</p>
   <p>Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the Republic , now known and honored throughout the earth , still full high advanced , its arms and trophies streaming in their original luster , not a stripe erased or polluted , not a single star obscured — bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory as , What is all this worth ? nor those other words of delusion and folly , Liberty first , and Union afterwards — but everywhere , spread all over in characters of living light , blazing on all its ample folds , as they float over the sea and over the land , and in every wind under the whole heavens , that other sentiment , dear to every true American heart — Liberty and Union , now and forever , one and inseparable ! — Daniel Webster .</p>
   <p>NOTE .— This selection is the peroration of Mr. Webster 's speech in reply to Mr. Hayne during the debate in the Senate on Mr . Foot 's Resolution in regard to the Public Lands .</p>
   <p>CIII . THE INFLUENCES OF THE SUN . ( 364 )</p>
   <p>John Tyndall , 1820-1893 , one of the most celebrated modern scientists , was an Irishman by birth . He was a pupil of the distinguished Faraday . In 1853 he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Institution of London . He is known chiefly for his brilliant experiments and clear writing respecting heat , light , and sound . He also wrote one or two interesting books concerning the Alps and their glaciers . He visited America , and delighted the most intelligent audiences by his scientific lectures and his brilliant experiments . The scientific world is indebted to him for several remarkable discoveries . ###</p>
   <p>As surely as the force which moves a clock 's hands is derived from the arm which winds up the clock , so surely is all terrestrial power drawn from the sun . Leaving out of account the eruptions of volcanoes , and the ebb and flow of the tides , every mechanical action on the earth 's surface , every manifestation of power , organic and inorganic , vital and physical , is produced by the sun . His warmth keeps the sea liquid , and the atmosphere a gas , and all the storms which agitate both are blown by the mechanical force of the sun . He lifts the rivers and the glaciers up to the mountains ; and thus the cataract and the avalanche shoot with an energy derived immediately from him .</p>
   <p>Thunder and lightning are also his transmitted strength . Every fire that burns and every flame that glows , dispenses light and heat which originally belonged to the sun . In these days , unhappily , the news of battle is familiar to us , but every shock and every charge is an application or misapplication of the mechanical force of the sun . He blows the trumpet , he urges the projectile , he bursts the bomb . And , remember , this is not poetry , but rigid mechanical truth .</p>
   <p>He rears , as I have said , the whole vegetable world , and through it the animal ; the lilies of the field are his workmanship , the verdure of the meadows , and the cattle upon a thousand hills . He forms the muscles , he urges the blood , he builds the brain . His fleetness is in the lion 's foot ; he springs in the panther , he soars in the eagle , he slides in the snake . He builds the forest and hews it down , the power which raised the tree , and which wields the ax , being one and the same . The clover sprouts and blossoms , and the scythe of the mower swings , by the operation of the same force .</p>
   <p>The sun digs the ore from our mines , he rolls the iron ; he rivets the plates , he boils the water ; he draws the train . He not only grows the cotton , but he spins the fiber and weaves the web . There is not a hammer raised , a wheel turned , or a shuttle thrown , that is not raised , and turned , and thrown by the sun .</p>
   <p>His energy is poured freely into space , but our world is a halting place where this energy is conditioned . Here the Proteus works his spells ; the selfsame essence takes a million shapes and hues , and finally dissolves into its primitive and almost formless form . The sun comes to us as heat ; he quits us as heat ; and between his entrance and departure the multiform powers of our globe appear . They are all special forms of solar power — the molds into which his strength is temporarily poured in passing from its source through infinitude .</p>
   <p>NOTE .— Proteus ( pro . Pro'tehYpppHeNus ) was a mythological divinity . His distinguishing characteristic was the power of assuming different shapes .</p>
   <p>CIV . COLLOQUIAL POWERS OF FRANKLIN . ( 366 )</p>
   <p>William Wirt , 1772-1834 , an American lawyer and author , was born at Bladensburg , Maryland . Left an orphan at an early age , he was placed in care of his uncle . He improved his opportunities for education so well that he became a private tutor at fifteen . In 1792 he was admitted to the bar , and began the practice of law in Virginia ; he removed to Richmond in 1799 . From 1817 to 1829 he was Attorney-general of the United States . His last years were spent in Baltimore . Mr. Wirt was the author of several books ; his “ Letters of a British Spy , ” published in 1803 , and “ Life of Patrick Henry , ” published in 1817 , are the best known of his writings . ###</p>
   <p>Never have I known such a fireside companion . Great as he was both as a statesman and philosopher , he never shone in a light more winning than when he was seen in a domestic circle . It was once my good fortune to pass two or three weeks with him , at the house of a private gentleman , in the back part of Pennsylvania , and we were confined to the house during the whole of that time by the unintermitting constancy and depth of the snows . But confinement never could be felt where Franklin was an inmate ; His cheerfulness and his colloquial powers spread around him a perpetual spring .</p>
   <p>When I speak , however , of his colloquial powers , I do not mean to awaken any notion analogous to that which Boswell has given us of Johnson . The conversation of the latter continually reminds one of the “ pomp and circumstance of glorious war . ” It was , indeed , a perpetual contest for victory , or an arbitrary or despotic exaction of homage to his superior talents . It was strong , acute , prompt , splendid , and vociferous ; as loud , stormy , and sublime as those winds which he represents as shaking the Hebrides , and rocking the old castle which frowned on the dark-rolling sea beneath .</p>
   <p>But one gets tired of storms , however sublime they may be , and longs for the more orderly current of nature . Of Franklin , no one ever became tired . There was no ambition of eloquence , no effort to shine in anything which came from him . There was nothing which made any demand upon either your allegiance or your admiration . His manner was as unaffected as infancy . It was nature 's self . He talked like an old patriarch ; and his plainness and simplicity put you at once at your ease , and gave you the full and free possession and use of your faculties . His thoughts were of a character to shine by their own light , without any adventitious aid . They only required a medium of vision like his pure and simple style , to exhibit to the highest advantage their native radiance and beauty .</p>
   <p>His cheerfulness was unremitting . It seemed to be as much the effect of a systematic and salutary exercise of the mind , as of its superior organization . His wit was of the first order . It did not show itself merely in occasional coruscations<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>; but , without any effort or force on his part , it shed a constant stream of the purest light over the whole of his discourse . Whether in the company of commons or nobles , he was always the same plain man ; always most perfectly at his ease , with his faculties in full play , and the full orbit of his genius forever clear and unclouded .</p>
   <note>Transcriber 's Footnote 1 : coruscations : flashes of light .</note>
   <p>And then , the stores of his mind were inexhaustible . He had commenced life with an attention so vigilant that nothing had escaped his observation ; and a judgment so solid that every incident was turned to advantage . His youth had not been wasted in idleness , nor overcast by intemperance . He had been , all his life , a close and deep reader , as well as thinker ; and by the force of his own powers , had wrought up the raw materials which he had gathered from books , with such exquisite skill and felicity , that he has added a hundred fold to their original value , and justly made them his own .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Benjamin Franklin ( b . 1706 , d. 1790 ) was one of the most prominent men in the struggle of the American colonies for liberty . He was renowned as a statesman , and , although not an author by profession , was a very prolific writer . His “ Autobiography , ” which was first printed in France , is now a household volume in America . See page 431 .</p>

     <l n="4">So full of ugly sights , of ghastly dreams ,</l>

     <l n="48">Unto the kingdom of perpetual night .</l>
     <l n="49">The first that there did greet my stranger soul ,</l>

     <l n="56">“ Clarence is come ! false , fleeting , perjured Clarence !</l>

     <l n="58">Seize on him , Furies , take him to your torments ! ”</l>

   <p>NOTES .— The houses of York and Lancaster were at war for the possession of the English throne . The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Gloster were brothers of King Edward IV ., who was head of the house of York . Clarence married the daughter of the Earl of Warwick , and joined the latter in several insurrections against the king . They finally plotted with Queen Margaret of the Lancaster party for the restoration of the latter house to the English throne , but Clarence betrayed Warwick and the Queen , and killed the latter 's son at the battle of Tewksbury . Through the plots of Gloster , Clarence was imprisoned in the Tower of London , and there murdered .</p>
   <p>Brakenbury was lieutenant of the Tower .</p>
   <p>The ferryman referred to is Charon , of Greek mythology , who was supposed to ferry the souls of the dead over the river Acheron to the infernal regions .</p>
   <p>CVI . HOMEWARD BOUND . ( 371 )</p>
   <p>Richard H. Dana , Jr ., 1815-1882 , was the son of Richard H. Dana , the poet . He was born in Cambridge , Mass . In his boyhood be had a strong desire to be a sailor , but by his father 's advice chose a student 's life , and entered Harvard University . At the age of nineteen an affection of the eyes compelled him to suspend his studies . He now made a voyage to California as a common sailor , and was gone two years . On his return , he resumed his studies and graduated in 1837 . He afterwards studied law , and entered upon an active and successful practice . Most of his life was spent in law and politics , although he won distinction in literature .</p>
   <p>The following extract is from his “ Two Years before the Mast , ” a book published in 1840 , giving an account of his voyage to California . This book details , in a most clear and entertaining manner , the everyday life of a common sailor on shipboard , and is the best known of all Mr. Dana 's works . ###</p>
   <p>It is usual , in voyages round the Cape from the Pacific , to keep to the eastward of the Falkland Islands ; but , as there had now set in a strong , steady , and clear southwester , with every prospect of its lasting , and we had had enough of high latitudes , the captain determined to stand immediately to the northward , running inside the Falkland Islands . Accordingly , when the wheel was relieved at eight o'clock , the order was given to keep her due north , and all hands were turned up to square away the yards and make sail .</p>
   <p>In a moment the news ran through the ship that the captain was keeping her off , with her nose straight for Boston , and Cape Horn over her taffrail . It was a moment of enthusiasm . Everyone was on the alert , and even the two sick men turned out to lend a hand at the halyards . The wind was now due southwest , and blowing a gale to which a vessel close-hauled could have shown no more than a single close-reefed sail ; but as we were going before it , we could carry on . Accordingly , hands were sent aloft and a reef shaken out of the topsails , and the reefed foresail set . When we came to masthead the topsail yards , with all hands at the halyards , we struck up , “ Cheerly , men , ” with a chorus which might have been heard halfway to Staten Island .</p>
   <p>Under her increased sail , the ship drove on through the water . Yet she could bear it well ; and the captain sang out from the quarter-deck — “ Another reef out of that fore topsail , and give it to her . ” Two hands sprang aloft ; the frozen reef points and earings were cast adrift , the halyards manned , and the sail gave out her increased canvas to the gale . All hands were kept on deck to watch the effect of the change . It was as much as she could well carry , and with a heavy sea astern , it took two men at the wheel to steer her .</p>
   <p>She flung the foam from her bows ; the spray breaking aft as far as the gangway . She was going at a prodigious rate . Still , everything held . Preventer braces were reeved and hauled taut ; tackles got upon the backstays ; and everything done to keep all snug and strong . The captain walked the deck at a rapid stride , looked aloft at the sails , and then to windward ; the mate stood in the gangway , rubbing his hands , and talking aloud to the ship — “ Hurrah , old bucket ! the Boston girls have got hold of the towrope ! ” and the like ; and we were on the forecastle looking to see how the spars stood it , and guessing the rate at which she was going ,— when the captain called out — “ Mr. Brown , get up the topmast studding sail ! What she can n't carry she may drag ! ”</p>
   <p>The mate looked a moment ; but he would let no one be before him in daring . He sprang forward ,— “ Hurrah , men ! rig out the topmast studding sail boom ! Lay aloft , and I 'll send the rigging up to you ! ” We sprang aloft into the top ; lowered a girtline down , by which we hauled up the rigging ; rove the tacks and halyards ; ran out the boom and lashed it fast , and sent down the lower halyards as a preventer . It was a clear starlight night , cold and blowing ; but everybody worked with a will . Some , indeed , looked as though they thought the “ old man ” was mad , but no one said a word .</p>
   <p>We had had a new topmast studding sail made with a reef in it ,— a thing hardly ever heard of , and which the sailors had ridiculed a good deal , saying that when it was time to reef a studding sail it was time to take it in . But we found a use for it now ; for , there being a reef in the topsail , the studding sail could not be set without one in it also . To be sure , a studding sail with reefed topsails was rather a novelty ; yet there was some reason in it , for if we carried that away , we should lose only a sail and a boom ; but a whole topsail might have carried away the mast and all .</p>
   <p>While we were aloft , the sail had been got out , bent to the yard , reefed , and ready for hoisting . Waiting for a good opportunity , the halyards were manned and the yard hoisted fairly up to the block ; but when the mate came to shake the cat'shYpppHeNpaw out of the downhaul , and we began to boom end the sail , it shook the ship to her center . The boom buckled up and bent like a whipstick , and we looked every moment to see something go ; but , being of the short , tough upland spruce , it bent like whalebone , and nothing could break it . The carpenter said it was the best stick he had ever seen .</p>
   <p>The strength of all hands soon brought the tack to the boom end , and the sheet was trimmed down , and the preventer and the weather brace hauled taut to take off the strain . Every rope-yarn seemed stretched to the utmost , and every thread of canvas ; and with this sail added to her , the ship sprang through the water like a thing possessed . The sail being nearly all forward , it lifted her out of the water , and she seemed actually to jump from sea to sea . From the time her keel was laid , she had never been so driven ; and had it been life or death with everyone of us , she could not have borne another stitch of canvas .</p>
   <p>Finding that she would bear the sail , the hands we 're sent below , and our watch remained on deck . Two men at the wheel had as much as they could do to keep her within three points of her course , for she steered as wild as a young colt . The mate walked the deck , looking at the sails , and then over the side to see the foam fly by her ,— slapping his hands upon his thighs and talking to the ship — “ Hurrah , you jade , you 've got the scent ! you know where you 're going ! ” And when she leaped over the seas , and almost out of the water , and trembled to her very keel , the spars and masts snapping and creaking , “ There she goes !— There she goes — handsomely !— As long as she cracks , she holds ! ” — while we stood with the rigging laid down fair for letting go , and ready to take in sail and clear away if anything went .</p>
   <p>At four bells we have the log , and she was going eleven knots fairly ; and had it not been for the sea from aft which sent the chip home , and threw her continually off her course , the log would have shown her to have been going somewhat faster . I went to the wheel with a young fellow from the Kennebec , who was a good helmsman ; and for two hours we had our hands full . A few minutes showed us that our monkey jackets must come off ; and , cold as it was , we stood in our shirt sleeves in a perspiration , and were glad enough to have it eight bells and the wheels relieved . We turned in and slept as well as we could , though the sea made a constant roar under her bows , and washed over the forecastle like a small cataract .</p>

   <p>CVII . IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS . ( 375 )</p>
   <p>Thomas Babington Macaulay , 1800-1859 , was born in the village of Rothley , Leicestershire . On his father 's side , he descended from Scotch Highlanders and ministers of the kirk . His education began at home , and was completed at Trinity College , Cambridge . While a student , he gained much reputation as a writer and a debater . In 1826 he was admitted to the bar . In 1825 began his connection with the “ Edinburgh Review , ” which continued twenty years . Some of his most brilliant essays appeared first in its pages . He was first chosen to Parliament in 1830 , and was reelected several times . In 1840 his essays and some other writings were collected and published with the title of “ Miscellanies . ” His “ Lays of Ancient Rome ” was published in 1842 . His “ History of England ” was published near the close of his life . In 1857 he was given the title of Baron Macaulay . “ His style is vigorous , rapid in its movement , and brilliant ; and yet , with all its splendor , has a crystalline clearness . Indeed , the fault generally found with his style is , that it is so constantly brilliant that the vision is dazzled and wearied with its excessive brightness . ” He has sometimes been charged with sacrificing facts to fine sentences .</p>
   <p>In his statesmanship , Macaulay was always an earnest defender of liberty . His first speech in Parliament was in support of a bill to remove the civil disabilities of the Jews , and his whole parliamentary career was consistent with this wise and liberal beginning . ###</p>
   <p>The place in which the impeachment of Warren Hastings was conducted , was worthy of such a trial . It was the great hall of William Rufus ; the hall which had resounded with acclamations at the inauguration of thirty kings ; the hall which had witnessed the just sentence of Bacon , and the just absolution of Somers ; the hall where the eloquence of Strafford had for a moment awed and melted a victorious party inflamed with just resentment ; the hall where Charles had confronted the High Court of Justice with the placid courage which half redeemed his fame .</p>
   <p>Neither military nor civil pomp was wanting . The avenues were lined with grenadiers . The streets were kept clear by cavalry . The peers , robed in gold and ermine , were marshaled by heralds . The judges , in their vestments of state , attended to give advice on points of law . The long galleries were crowded by such an audience as has rarely excited the fears or the emulation of an orator . There were gathered together , from all parts of a great , free , enlightened , and prosperous realm , grace and female loveliness , wit and learning , the representatives of every science and of every art .</p>
   <p>There were seated around the queen , the fair-haired , young daughters of the house of Brunswick . There the embassadors of great kings and commonwealths gazed with admiration on a spectacle which no other country in the world could present . There Siddons , in the prime of her majestic beauty , looked with emotion on a scene surpassing all the imitations of the stage . There Gibbon , the historian of the Roman Empire , thought of the days when Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily against Verres ; and when , before a senate which had still some show of freedom , Tacitus thundered against the oppressor of Africa . There , too , were seen , side by side , the greatest painter and the greatest scholar of the age ; for the spectacle had allured Reynolds from his easel and Parr from his study .</p>
   <p>The sergeants made proclamation . Hastings advanced to the bar , and bent his knee . The culprit was indeed not unworthy of that great presence . He had ruled an extensive and populous country ; had made laws and treaties ; had sent forth armies ; had set up and pulled down princes ; and in his high place he had so borne himself , that all had feared him , that most had loved him , and that hatred itself could deny him no title to glory , except virtue . A person , small and emaciated , yet deriving dignity from a carriage which , while it indicated deference to the court , indicated , also , habitual self-possession and self-respect ; a high and intellectual forehead ; a brow , pensive , but not gloomy ; a mouth of inflexible decision ; a face , pale and worn , but serene , on which a great and well-balanced mind was legibly written : such was the aspect with which the great proconsul presented himself to his judges .</p>
   <p>The charges , and the answers of Hastings , were first read . This ceremony occupied two whole days . On the third , Burke rose . Four sittings of the court were occupied by his opening speech , which was intended to be a general introduction to all the charges . With an exuberance of thought and a splendor of diction , which more than satisfied the highly raised expectations of the audience , he described the character and institutions of the natives of India ; recounted the circumstances in which the Asiatic Empire of Britain had originated ; and set forth the constitution of the Company and of the English Presidencies .</p>
   <p>Having thus attempted to communicate to his hearers an idea of eastern society , as vivid as that which existed in his own mind , he proceeded to arraign the administration of Hastings , as systematically conducted in defiance of morality and public law . The energy and pathos of the great orator extorted expressions of unwonted admiration from all ; and , for a moment , seemed to pierce even the resolute heart of the defendant . The ladies in the galleries , unaccustomed to such displays of eloquence , excited by the solemnity of the occasion , and perhaps not unwilling to display their taste and sensibility , were in a state of uncontrollable emotion . Handkerchiefs were pulled out ; smelling bottles were handed round ; hysterical sobs and screams were heard , and some were even carried out in fits .</p>
   <p>At length the orator concluded . Raising his voice , till the old arches of Irish oak resounded — “ Therefore , ” said he , “ hath it with all confidence been ordered by the Commons of Great Britain , that I impeach Warren Hastings of high crimes and misdemeanors . I impeach him in the name of the Commons House of Parliament , whose trust he has betrayed . I impeach him in the name of the English nation , whose ancient honor he has sullied . I impeach him in the name of the people of India , whose rights he has trodden under foot , and whose country he has turned into a desert . Lastly , in the name of human nature itself , in the name of both sexes , in the name of every age , in the name of every rank , I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all . ”</p>
   <p>NOTES .— Warren Hastings ( b . 1732 , d. 1818 ) was Governor-general of British India . He was impeached for maladministration , but , after a trial which extended from Feb. 13th , 1788 , to April 23d , 1795 , and occupied one hundred and forty-eight days , he was acquitted by a large majority on each separate count of the impeachment .</p>
   <p>William Rufus , or William II . ( b . 1056 , d. 1100 ) , built Westminster Hall in which the trial was held . Bacon ; see biographical notice , pages 332 and 333 . Somers , John ( b . 1651. d. 1716 ) was impeached for maladministration while holding the office of lord chamberlain . Strafford , Thomas Wentworth , earl of , ( b . 1593 , d. 1641 ,) was impeached for his mismanagement while governor of Ireland . He conducted his own defense with such eloquence that the original impeachment was abandoned , although he was immediately condemned for high treason and executed . Charles I . ( b . 1600 , d. 1649 ) , after a war with Parliament , in which the rights of the people were at issue , was captured , tried , and condemned to death .</p>

   <p>CVIII . DESTRUCTION OF THE CARNATIC .</p>
   <p>Edmund Burke , 1730-1797 , one of the most able and brilliant of England 's essayists , orators , and statesmen , was born in Dublin , and was the son of an able lawyer . He graduated at Trinity College , Dublin , in 1748 . As a student , he was distinguished for ability and industry . From 1750 to 1766 he was in London writing for periodicals , publishing books , or serving as private secretary . His work on “ The Sublime and Beautiful ” appeared in 1756 . From 1766 to 1794 he was a member of Parliament , representing at different times different constituencies . On the first day of his appearance in the House of Commons he made a successful speech . “ In the three principal questions which excited his interest , and called forth the most splendid displays of his eloquence — the contest with the American Colonies , the impeachment of Warren Hastings , and the French Revolution — we see displayed a philanthropy the most pure , illustrated by a genius the most resplendent . ” Mr. Burke 's foresight , uprightness , integrity , learning , magnanimity , and eloquence made him one of the most conspicuous men of his time ; and his writings stand among the noblest contributions to English literature . ###</p>
   <p>When at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either would sign no convention , or whom no treaty and no signature could bind , and who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself , he decreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and predestinated criminals a memorable example to mankind . He resolved , in the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things , to leave the whole Carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance , and to put perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection .</p>
   <p>He became at length so confident of his force , so collected in his might , that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution . Having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival , who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot , he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction ; and compounding all the materials of fury , havoc , and desolation into one black cloud , he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains .</p>
   <p>Whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon , it suddenly burst , and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic .</p>
   <p>Then ensued a scene of woe , the like of which no eye had seen , no heart conceived , and which no tongue can adequately tell . All the horrors of war before known or heard of , were mercy to that new havoc . A storm of universal fire blasted every field , consumed every house , destroyed every temple . The miserable inhabitants , flying from their flaming villages , in part were slaughtered ; others , without regard to sex , to age , to the respect of rank , or sacredness of function ,— fathers torn from children , husbands from wives , enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry , and , amidst the goading spears of drivers , and the trampling of pursuing horses ,— were swept into captivity , in an unknown and hostile land .</p>
   <p>Those who were able to evade this tempest , fled to the walled cities ; but escaping from fire , sword , and exile , they fell into the jaws of famine . The alms of the settlement of Madras , in this dreadful exigency , were certainly liberal , and all was done by charity that private charity could do ; but it was a people in beggary ; it was a nation which stretched out its hands for food .</p>
   <p>For months together these creatures of sufferance , whose very excess and luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance of our austerest fasts , silent , patient , resigned , without sedition or disturbance , almost without complaint , perished by a hundred a day in the streets of Madras ; every day seventy at least laid their bodies in the streets , or on the glacis of Tanjore , and expired of famine in the granary of India .</p>
   <p>I was going to wake your justice toward this unhappy part of our fellow-citizens , by bringing before you some of the circumstances of this plague of hunger . Of all the calamities which beset and waylay the life of man , this comes the nearest to our heart , and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is .</p>
   <p>But I find myself unable to manage it with decorum . These details are of a species of horror so nauseous and disgusting ; they are so degrading to the sufferers and to the hearers ; they are so humiliating to human nature itself , that , on better thoughts , I find it more advisable to throw a pall over this hideous object , and to leave it to your general conceptions .</p>
   <p>For eighteen months , without intermission , this destruction raged from the gates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore ; and so completely did these masters in their art , Hyder Ali , and his more ferocious son , absolve themselves of their impious vow , that when the British armies traversed , as they did , the Carnatic , for hundreds of miles in all directions , through the whole line of their march they did not see one man — not one woman — not one child — not one four-footed beast of any description whatever ! One dead , uniform silence reigned over the whole region .</p>
   <p>With the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few forts , I wish to be understood as speaking literally ;— I mean to produce to you more than three witnesses , who will support this assertion in its full extent . That hurricane of war passed through every part of the central provinces of the Carnatic . Six or seven districts to the north and to the south ( and these not wholly untouched ) escaped the general ravage .</p>
   <p>NOTES .— This selection is an extract from Burke 's celebrated speech in Parliament , in 1785 , on the Nabob of Arcot 's debts ; it bore upon the maladministration of Hastings .</p>
   <p>Arcot , a district in India , had been ceded to the British on condition that they should pay the former ruler 's debts . These were found to be enormous , and the creditors proved to be individuals in the East India Company 's employ . The creditors , for their private gain , induced the Nabob to attempt the subjugation of other native princes , among whom was Hyder Ali . The latter at first made successful resistance , and compelled the Nabob and his allies to sign a treaty . The treaty was not kept , and the destruction above recounted took place .</p>
   <p>The Carnatic is a province in British India , on the eastern side of the peninsula ; it contains about 50 , 000 square miles . Madras is a city , and Tanjore a town , in this province .</p>

    <head>CIX . THE RAVEN .</head>
    <head>Edgar Allan Poe , 1809-1849 , was born in Boston , and died in Baltimore . He was left a destitute orphan at an early age , and was adopted by Mr. John Allan , a wealthy citizen of Richmond . He entered the University of Virginia , at Charlottesville , where he excelled in his studies , and was always at the head of his class ; but he was compelled to leave on account of irregularities . He was afterwards appointed a cadet at West Point , but failed to graduate there for the same reason . Poe now quarreled with his benefactor and left his house never to return . During the rest of his melancholy career , he obtained a precarious livelihood by different literary enterprises . His ability as a writer gained him positions with various periodicals in Richmond , New York , and Philadelphia , and during this time he wrote some of his finest prose . The appearance of “ The Raven ” in 1845 , however , at once made Poe a literary lion . He was quite successful for a time , but then fell back into his dissipated habits which finally caused his death . In his personal appearance , Poe was neat and gentlemanly ; his face was expressive of intellect and sensibility ; and his mental powers in some directions were of a high order . His writings show care , and a great degree of skill in their construction ; but their effect is generally morbid . ###</head>

     <l n="22">Nameless here for evermore .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="23">And the silken , sad , uncertain</l>
     <l n="24">Rustling of each purple curtain</l>
     <l n="25">Thrilled me ,— filled me with fantastic</l>
     <l n="26">Terrors , never felt before ;</l>
     <l n="27">So that now , to still the beating</l>
     <l n="28">Of my heart , I stood repeating ,</l>
     <l n="29">" ‘ Tis some visitor entreating</l>
     <l n="30">Entrance at my chamber door</l>
     <l n="31">Some late visitor entreating</l>
     <l n="32">Entrance at my chamber door ;</l>
     <l n="33">This it is , and nothing more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="34">Presently my soul grew stronger ;</l>
     <l n="35">Hesitating then no longer ,</l>
     <l n="36">“ Sir , ” said I , “ or Madam , truly</l>
     <l n="37">Your forgiveness I implore ;</l>
     <l n="38">But the fact is I was napping ,</l>
     <l n="39">And so gently you came rapping ,</l>
     <l n="40">And so faintly you came tapping ,</l>
     <l n="41">Tapping at my chamber door ,</l>
     <l n="42">That I scarce was sure I heard you . ” —</l>
     <l n="43">Here I opened wide the door ;</l>
     <l n="44">Darkness there , and nothing more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="45">Deep into that darkness peering ,</l>
     <l n="46">Long I stood there , wondering , fearing ,</l>
     <l n="47">Doubting , dreaming dreams no mortals</l>
     <l n="48">Ever dared to dream before ;</l>
     <l n="49">But the silence was unbroken ,</l>
     <l n="50">And the stillness gave no token ,</l>
     <l n="51">And the only word there spoken</l>
     <l n="52">Was the whispered word , “ Lenore ! ”</l>
     <l n="53">This I whispered , and an echo</l>
     <l n="54">Murmured back the word , “ Lenore ! ”</l>
     <l n="55">Merely this , and nothing more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="56">Back into the chamber turning ,</l>
     <l n="57">All my soul within me burning ,</l>
     <l n="58">Soon again I heard a tapping ,</l>
     <l n="59">Something louder than before .</l>
     <l n="60">“ Surely , ” said I , “ surely , that is</l>
     <l n="61">Something at my window lattice ;</l>
     <l n="62">Let me see then , what thereat is ,</l>
     <l n="63">And this mystery explore —</l>
     <l n="64">Let my heart be still a moment ,</l>
     <l n="65">And this mystery explore ;—</l>
     <l n="66">‘ Tis the wind , and nothing more . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="67">Open here I flung the shutter .</l>
     <l n="68">When , with many a flirt and flutter ,</l>
     <l n="69">In there stepped a stately Raven</l>
     <l n="70">Of the saintly days of yore ;</l>
     <l n="71">Not the least obeisance made he ;</l>
     <l n="72">Not a minute stopped or stayed he ,</l>
     <l n="73">But , with mien of lord or lady ,</l>
     <l n="74">Perched above my chamber door —</l>
     <l n="75">Perched upon a bust of Pallas</l>
     <l n="76">Just above my chamber door —</l>
     <l n="77">Perched , and sat , and nothing more .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="78">Then this ebony bird beguiling</l>
     <l n="79">My sad fancy into smiling ,</l>
     <l n="80">By the grave and stern decorum</l>
     <l n="81">Of the countenance it wore ,</l>
     <l n="82">“ Though thy crest be shorn and shaven ,</l>
     <l n="83">Thou , ” I said , “ art sure no craven ,</l>
     <l n="84">Ghastly , grim , and ancient Raven ,</l>
     <l n="85">Wandering from the nightly shore ,</l>
     <l n="86">Tell me what thy lordly name is</l>
     <l n="87">On the night 's Plutonian shore ! ”</l>
     <l n="88">Quoth the Raven , “ Nevermore . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="89">Much I marveled this ungainly</l>
     <l n="90">Fowl to hear discourse so plainly ,</l>
     <l n="91">Though its answer little meaning —</l>
     <l n="92">Little relevancy bore ;</l>
     <l n="93">For we can not help agreeing</l>
     <l n="94">That no living human being</l>
     <l n="95">Ever yet was blest with seeing</l>
     <l n="96">Bird above his chamber door —</l>
     <l n="97">Bird or beast upon the sculptured</l>
     <l n="98">Bust above his chamber door ,</l>
     <l n="99">With such name as “ Nevermore . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="100">But the Raven , sitting lonely</l>
     <l n="101">On that placid bust , spoke only</l>
     <l n="102">That one word , as if his soul in</l>
     <l n="103">That one word he did outpour .</l>
     <l n="104">Nothing farther then he uttered ,</l>
     <l n="105">Not a feather then he fluttered ,</l>
     <l n="106">Till I scarcely more than muttered ,</l>
     <l n="107">“ Other friends have flown before —</l>
     <l n="108">On the morrow he will leave me ,</l>
     <l n="109">As my Hopes have flown before . ”</l>
     <l n="110">Then the bird said , “ Nevermore . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="111">Startled at the stillness broken</l>
     <l n="112">By reply so aptly spoken ,</l>
     <l n="113">“ Doubtless , ” said I , “ what it utters</l>
     <l n="114">Is its only stock and store ,</l>
     <l n="115">Caught from some unhappy master</l>
     <l n="116">Whom unmerciful Disaster</l>
     <l n="117">Followed fast and followed faster</l>
     <l n="118">Till his songs one burden bore —</l>
     <l n="119">Till the dirges of his Hope that</l>
     <l n="120">Melancholy burden bore</l>
     <l n="121">Of ‘ Never — nevermore . ’ "</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="122">But the Raven still beguiling</l>
     <l n="123">All my sad soul into smiling ,</l>
     <l n="124">Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in</l>
     <l n="125">Front of bird , and bust , and door ;</l>
     <l n="126">Then , upon the velvet sinking ,</l>
     <l n="127">I betook myself to linking</l>
     <l n="128">Fancy unto fancy , thinking</l>
     <l n="129">What this ominous bird of yore —</l>
     <l n="130">What this grim , ungainly , ghastly ,</l>
     <l n="131">Gaunt , and ominous bird of yore</l>
     <l n="132">Meant in croaking “ Nevermore . ”</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="133">This I sat engaged in guessing ,</l>
     <l n="134">But no syllable expressing</l>
     <l n="135">To the fowl whose fiery eyes now</l>
     <l n="136">Burned into my bosom 's core ;</l>
     <l n="137">This and more I sat divining ,</l>
     <l n="138">With my head at ease reclining</l>
     <l n="139">On the cushion 's velvet lining</l>
     <l n="140">That the lamplight gloated o'er ,</l>
     <l n="141">But whose velvet violet lining ,</l>
     <l n="142">With the lamplight gloating o'er</l>
     <l n="143">She shall press , ah , nevermore !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="144">Then , methought , the air grew denser ,</l>
     <l n="145">Perfumed from an unseen censer</l>
     <l n="146">Swung by Seraphim , whose footfalls</l>
     <l n="147">Tinkled on the tufted floor .</l>
     <l n="148">“ Wretch , ” I cried , “ thy God hath lent thee —</l>
     <l n="149">By these angels he hath sent thee</l>
     <l n="150">Respite — respite and nepenthe<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span></l>
     <l n="151">From thy memories of Lenore !</l>
     <l n="152">Quaff , oh quaff this kind nepenthe ,</l>
     <l n="153">And forget this lost Lenore ! ”</l>
     <l n="154">Quoth the Raven , “ Nevermore . ”</l>
