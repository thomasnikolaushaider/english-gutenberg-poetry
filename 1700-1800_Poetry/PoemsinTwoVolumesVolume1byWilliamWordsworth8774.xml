    <p>TO THE DAISY . In youth from rock to rock I went From hill to hill , in discontent Of pleasure high and turbulent , Most pleas 'd when most uneasy ; But now my own delights I make , My thirst at every rill can slake , And gladly Nature 's love partake Of thee , sweet Daisy ! When soothed a while by milder airs , Thee Winter in the garland wears 10 That thinly shades his few grey hairs ; Spring cannot shun thee ; Whole summer fields are thine by right ; And Autumn , melancholy Wight ! Doth in thy crimson head delight When rains are on thee . In shoals and bands , a morrice train , Thou greet'st the Traveller in the lane ; If welcome once thou count'st it gain ; Thou art not daunted , 20 Nor car'st if thou be set at naught ; And oft alone in nooks remote We meet thee , like a pleasant thought , When such are wanted . Be Violets in their secret mews The flowers the wanton Zephyrs chuse ; Proud be the Rose , with rains and dews Her head impearling ; Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim , Yet hast not gone without thy fame ; 30 Thou art indeed by many a claim The Poet 's darling . If to a rock from rains he fly , Or , some bright day of April sky , Imprison 'd by hot sunshine lie Near the green holly , And wearily at length should fare ; He need but look about , and there Thou art ! a Friend at hand , to scare His melancholy . 40 A hundred times , by rock or bower , Ere thus I have lain couch 'd an hour , Have I derived from thy sweet power Some apprehension ; Some steady love ; some brief delight ; Some memory that had taken flight ; Some chime of fancy wrong or right ; Or stray invention . If stately passions in me burn , And one chance look to Thee should turn , 50 I drink out of an humbler urn A lowlier pleasure ; The homely sympathy that heeds The common life , our nature breeds ; A wisdom fitted to the needs Of hearts at leisure . When , smitten by the morning ray , I see thee rise alert and gay , Then , chearful Flower ! my spirits play With kindred motion : 60 At dusk , I 've seldom mark 'd thee press The ground , as if in thankfulness , Without some feeling , more or less , Of true devotion . And all day long I number yet , All seasons through , another debt , Which I wherever thou art met , To thee am owing ; An instinct call it , a blind sense ; A happy , genial influence , 70 Coming one knows not how nor whence , Nor whither going . Child of the Year ! that round dost run Thy course , bold lover of the sun , And chearful when the day 's begun As morning Leveret , Thou long the Poet 's praise shalt gain ; Thou wilt be more belov 'd by men In times to come ; thou not in vain Art Nature 's Favorite . 80 LOUISA . I met Louisa in the shade ; And , having seen that lovely Maid , Why should I fear to say That she is ruddy , fleet , and strong ; And down the rocks can leap along , Like rivulets in May ? And she hath smiles to earth unknown ; Smiles , that with motion of their own Do spread , and sink , and rise ; That come and go with endless play , 10 And ever , as they pass away , Are hidden in her eyes . She loves her fire , her Cottage-home ; Yet o'er the moorland will she roam In weather rough and bleak ; And when against the wind she strains , Oh ! might I kiss the mountain rains That sparkle on her cheek . Take all that 's mine ‘ beneath the moon ’ , If I with her but half a noon 20 May sit beneath the walls Of some old cave , or mossy nook , When up she winds along the brook , To hunt the waterfalls . FIDELITY . A barking sound the Shepherd hears , A cry as of a Dog or Fox ; He halts , and searches with his eyes Among the scatter 'd rocks : And now at distance can discern A stirring in a brake of fern ; From which immediately leaps out A Dog , and yelping runs about . The Dog is not of mountain breed ; It 's motions , too , are wild and shy ; 10 With something , as the Shepherd thinks , Unusual in its ’ cry : Nor is there any one in sight All round , in Hollow or on Height ; Nor shout , nor whistle strikes his ear ; What is the Creature doing here ? It was a Cove , a huge Recess , That keeps till June December 's snow ; A lofty Precipice in front , A silent Tarn<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>below ! 20 Far in the bosom of Helvellyn , Remote from public Road or Dwelling , Pathway , or cultivated land ; From trace of human foot or hand . [ Footnote 1 : A Tarn is a small Mere or Lake mostly high up in the mountains . ] There , sometimes does a leaping Fish Send through the Tarn a lonely chear ; The Crags repeat the Raven 's croak , In symphony austere ; Thither the Rainbow comes , the Cloud ; And Mists that spread the flying shroud ; 30 And Sun-beams ; and the sounding blast , That , if it could , would hurry past , But that enormous Barrier binds it fast . Not knowing what to think , a while The Shepherd stood : then makes his way Towards the Dog , o'er rocks and stones , As quickly as he may ; Nor far had gone before he found A human skeleton on the ground , Sad sight ! the Shepherd with a sigh 40 Looks round , to learn the history . From those abrupt and perilous rocks , The Man had fallen , that place of fear ! At length upon the Shepherd 's mind It breaks , and all is clear : He instantly recall 'd the Name , And who he was , and whence he came ; Remember 'd , too , the very day On which the Traveller pass 'd this way . But hear a wonder now , for sake 50 Of which this mournful Tale I tell ! A lasting monument of words This wonder merits well . The Dog , which still was hovering nigh , Repeating the same timid cry , This Dog had been through three months ’ space A Dweller in that savage place . Yes , proof was plain that since the day On which the Traveller thus had died The Dog had watch 'd about the spot , 60 Or by his Master 's side : How nourish 'd here through such long time He knows , who gave that love sublime , And gave that strength of feeling , great Above all human estimate .</p>

    <p n="1">NOTE I .</p>
    <p n="2">PAGE I ( 9 ) .— To the Daisy . This Poem , and two others to the same Flower , which the Reader will find in the second Volume , were written in the year 1802 ; which is mentioned , because in some of the ideas , though not in the manner in which those ideas are connected , and likewise even in some of the expressions , they bear a striking resemblance to a Poem ( lately published ) of Mr. Montgomery , entitled , a Field Flower . This being said , Mr. Montgomery will not think any apology due to him ; I cannot however help addressing him in the words of the Father of English Poets .</p>
    <p n="3">‘ Though it happe me to rehersin — That ye han in your freshe song is saied , Forberith me , and beth not ill apaied , Sith that ye se I doe it in the honour Of Love , and eke in service of the Flour . ’</p>
