    <head>VISITOR .</head>
     <l n="1">I 'll know no more ;— the heart is torn</l>
     <l n="2">By views of woe we cannot heal ;</l>
     <l n="3">Long shall I see these things forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="4">And oft again their griefs shall feel ,</l>
     <l n="5">As each upon the mind shall steal ;</l>
     <l n="6">That wan projector 's mystic style ,</l>
     <l n="7">That lumpish idiot leering by ,</l>
     <l n="8">That peevish idler 's ceaseless wile ,</l>
     <l n="9">And that poor maiden 's half-form 'd smile ,</l>
     <l n="10">While struggling for the full-drawn sigh ! -</l>
     <l n="11">I 'll know no more .</l>

     <l n="1">Yes , turn again ;</l>
     <l n="2">Then speed to happier scenes thy way ,</l>
     <l n="3">When thou hast view 'd , what yet remain ,</l>
     <l n="4">The ruins of Sir Eustace Grey ,</l>
     <l n="5">The sport of madness , misery 's prey :</l>
     <l n="6">But he will no historian need ,</l>
     <l n="7">His cares , his crimes , will he display ,</l>
     <l n="8">And show ( as one from frenzy freed )</l>
     <l n="9">The proud lost mind , the rash-done deed .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="10">That cell to him is Greyling Hall : -</l>
     <l n="11">Approach ; he 'll bid thee welcome there ;</l>
     <l n="12">Will sometimes for his servant call ,</l>
     <l n="13">And sometimes point the vacant chair :</l>
     <l n="14">He can , with free and easy air ,</l>
     <l n="15">Appear attentive and polite ;</l>
     <l n="16">Can veil his woes in manners fair ,</l>
     <l n="17">And pity with respect excite .</l>

    <head>PATIENT .</head>
     <l n="1">Who comes ?— Approach !— ‘ tis kindly done : -</l>
     <l n="2">My learn 'd physician , and a friend ,</l>
     <l n="3">Their pleasures quit , to visit one</l>
     <l n="4">Who cannot to their ease attend ,</l>
     <l n="5">Nor joys bestow , nor comforts lend ,</l>
     <l n="6">As when I lived so blest , so well ,</l>
     <l n="7">And dreamt not I must soon contend</l>
     <l n="8">With those malignant powers of hell .</l>

    <head>PATIENT .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">See ! I am calm as infant love ,</l>
     <l n="2">A very child , but one of woe ,</l>
     <l n="3">Whom you should pity , not reprove : -</l>
     <l n="4">But men at ease , who never strove</l>
     <l n="5">With passions wild , will calmly show</l>
     <l n="6">How soon we may their ills remove ,</l>
     <l n="7">And masters of their madness grow .</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="8">Some twenty years , I think , are gone , -</l>

     <l n="10">The sun upon no happier shone ,</l>
     <l n="11">Nor prouder man , than Eustace Grey .</l>
     <l n="12">Ask where you would , and all would say ,</l>
     <l n="13">The man admired and praised of all ,</l>
     <l n="14">By rich and poor , by grave and gay ,</l>
     <l n="15">Was the young lord of Greyling Hall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="16">Yes ! I had youth and rosy health ;</l>
     <l n="17">Was nobly form 'd , as man might be ;</l>
     <l n="18">For sickness , then , of all my wealth ,</l>
     <l n="19">I never gave a single fee :</l>
     <l n="20">The ladies fair , the maidens free ,</l>
     <l n="21">Were all accustom 'd then to say ,</l>
     <l n="22">Who would a handsome figure see</l>
     <l n="23">Should look upon Sir Eustace Grey .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="24">He had a frank and pleasant look ,</l>
     <l n="25">A cheerful eye and accent bland ;</l>
     <l n="26">His very speech and manner spoke</l>
     <l n="27">The generous heart , the open hand ;</l>
     <l n="28">About him all was gay or grand ,</l>
     <l n="29">He had the praise of great and small ;</l>
     <l n="30">He bought , improved , projected , plann 'd ,</l>
     <l n="31">And reign 'd a prince at Greyling Hall .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="5">
     <l n="32">My lady !— she was all we love ;</l>
     <l n="33">All praise ( to speak her worth ) is faint ;</l>
     <l n="34">Her manners show 'd the yielding dove ,</l>
     <l n="35">Her morals , the seraphic saint :</l>
     <l n="36">She never breath 'd nor look 'd complaint ;</l>
     <l n="37">No equal upon earth had she -</l>
     <l n="38">Now , what is this fair thing I paint ?</l>
     <l n="39">Alas ! as all that live shall be .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="40">There was , beside , a gallant youth ,</l>
     <l n="41">And him my bosom 's friend I had ; -</l>
     <l n="42">Oh ! I was rich in very truth ,</l>
     <l n="43">It made me proud — it made me mad ! -</l>
     <l n="44">Yes , I was lost — but there was cause ! -</l>
     <l n="45">Where stood my tale ?— I cannot find -</l>
     <l n="46">But I had all mankind 's applause ,</l>
     <l n="47">And all the smiles of womankind .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="7">
     <l n="48">There were two cherub-things beside ,</l>
     <l n="49">A gracious girl , a glorious boy ;</l>
     <l n="50">Yet more to swell my full-blown pride ,</l>
     <l n="51">To varnish higher my fading joy ,</l>
     <l n="52">Pleasures were ours without alloy ,</l>
     <l n="53">Nay , Paradise ,— till my frail Eve</l>
     <l n="54">Our bliss was tempted to destroy -</l>
     <l n="55">Deceived and fated to deceive .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="8">
     <l n="56">But I deserved ;— for all that time ,</l>
     <l n="57">When I was loved , admired , caress 'd ,.</l>
     <l n="58">There was within , each secret crime ,</l>
     <l n="59">Unfelt , uncancell 'd , unconfess 'd :</l>
     <l n="60">I never then my God address 'd ,</l>
     <l n="61">In grateful praise or humble prayer ;</l>
     <l n="62">And if His Word was not my jest -</l>
     <l n="63">( Dread thought ! ) it never was my care .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="9">
     <l n="64">I doubted : — fool I was to doubt !</l>
     <l n="65">If that all-piercing eye could see , -</l>
     <l n="66">If He who looks all worlds throughout ,</l>
     <l n="67">Would so minute and careful be</l>
     <l n="68">As to perceive and punish me : -</l>
     <l n="69">With man I would be great and high ,</l>
     <l n="70">But with my God so lost , that He ,</l>
     <l n="71">In His large view should pass me by .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="10">
     <l n="72">Thus blest with children , friend , and wife ,</l>
     <l n="73">Blest far beyond the vulgar lot ;</l>
     <l n="74">Of all that gladdens human life ,</l>
     <l n="75">Where was the good that I had not ?</l>
     <l n="76">But my vile heart had sinful spot ,</l>
     <l n="77">And Heaven beheld its deep'ning stain ;</l>
     <l n="78">Eternal justice I forgot ,</l>
     <l n="79">And mercy sought not to obtain .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="11">
     <l n="80">Come near ,— I 'll softly speak the rest ! -</l>
     <l n="81">Alas ! ‘ tis known to all the crowd ,</l>
     <l n="82">Her guilty love was all confess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="83">And his , who so much truth avow 'd ,</l>
     <l n="84">My faithless friend 's .— In pleasure proud</l>
     <l n="85">I sat , when these cursed tidings came ;</l>
     <l n="86">Their guilt , their flight was told aloud ,</l>
     <l n="87">And Envy smiled to hear my shame !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="12">
     <l n="88">I call 'd on Vengeance ; at the word</l>
     <l n="89">She came : — Can I the deed forget ?</l>
     <l n="90">I held the sword — the accursed sword</l>
     <l n="91">The blood of his false heart made wet ;</l>
     <l n="92">And that fair victim paid her debt ,</l>
     <l n="93">She pined , she died , she loath 'd to live ; -</l>
     <l n="94">I saw her dying — see her yet :</l>
     <l n="95">Fair fallen thing ! my rage forgive !</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="13">
     <l n="96">Those cherubs still , my life to bless ,</l>
     <l n="97">Were left ; could I my fears remove ,</l>
     <l n="98">Sad fears that check 'd each fond caress ,</l>
     <l n="99">And poison 'd all parental love ?</l>
     <l n="100">Yet that with jealous feelings strove ,</l>
     <l n="101">And would at last have won my will ,</l>
     <l n="102">Had I not , wretch ! been doom 'd to prove</l>
     <l n="103">Th ’ extremes of mortal good and ill .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="14">
     <l n="104">In youth ! health ! joy ! in beauty 's pride !</l>
     <l n="105">They droop 'd — as flowers when blighted bow ;</l>
     <l n="106">The dire infection came : — they died ,</l>
     <l n="107">And I was cursed — as I am now ; -</l>
     <l n="108">Nay , frown not , angry friend ,— allow</l>
     <l n="109">That I was deeply , sorely tried ;</l>
     <l n="110">Hear then , and you must wonder how</l>
     <l n="111">I could such storms and strifes abide .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="15">
     <l n="112">Storms !— not that clouds embattled make ,</l>
     <l n="113">When they afflict this earthly globe ;</l>
     <l n="114">But such as with their terrors shake</l>
     <l n="115">Man 's breast , and to the bottom probe ;</l>
     <l n="116">They make the hypocrite disrobe ,</l>
     <l n="117">They try us all , if false or true ;</l>
     <l n="118">For this one Devil had power on Job ;</l>
     <l n="119">And I was long the slave of two .</l>

     <l n="1">And shall I then the fact deny ?</l>
     <l n="2">I was — thou know'st — I was begone ,</l>
     <l n="3">Like him who fill 'd the eastern throne ,</l>
     <l n="4">To whom the Watcher cried aloud ;</l>
     <l n="5">That royal wretch of Babylon ,</l>
     <l n="6">Who was so guilty and so proud .</l>
    </lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="2">
     <l n="7">Like him , with haughty , stubborn mind ,</l>
     <l n="8">I , in my state , my comforts sought ;</l>

     <l n="10">In what I builded , planted ! bought !</l>
     <l n="11">Oh ! arrogance ! by misery taught -</l>
     <l n="12">Soon came a voice ! I felt it come ;</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="3">
     <l n="15">Then was I cast from out my state ;</l>
     <l n="16">Two fiends of darkness led my way ;</l>
     <l n="17">They waked me early , watch 'd me late ,</l>
     <l n="18">My dread by night , my plague by day !</l>
     <l n="19">Oh ! I was made their sport , their play ,</l>
     <l n="20">Through many a stormy troubled year ;</l>
     <l n="21">And how they used their passive prey</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="4">
     <l n="23">And first before they sent me forth .</l>
     <l n="24">Through this unpitying world to run ,</l>

     <l n="26">Lands , manors , lordships , every one ;</l>
     <l n="27">So was that gracious man undone ,</l>
     <l n="28">Was spurn 'd as vile , was scorn 'd as poor ,</l>
     <l n="29">Whom every former friend would shun ,</l>

     <l n="31">Then rose ill-favour 'd Ones , whom none</l>

     <l n="34">And , with resistless terror , drew .</l>
     <l n="35">Through lands we fled , o'er seas we flew ,</l>
     <l n="36">And halted on a boundless plain ;</l>
     <l n="37">Where nothing fed , nor breathed , nor grew ,</l>

    <lg type="stanza" n="6">
     <l n="39">Upon that boundless plain , below ,</l>
     <l n="40">The setting sun 's last rays were shed ,</l>
     <l n="41">And gave a mild and sober glow ,</l>
     <l n="42">Where all were still , asleep , or dead ;</l>
     <l n="43">Vast ruins in the midst were spread ,</l>
     <l n="44">Pillars and pediments sublime ,</l>
     <l n="45">Where the gray mass had form 'd a bed ,</l>

     <l n="55">At length a moment 's sleep stole on , -</l>

     <l n="59">Above the dark broad sea we rose ,</l>
     <l n="60">We ran through bleak and frozen land ;</l>
     <l n="61">I had no strength their strength t'oppose ,</l>
     <l n="62">An infant in a giant 's hand .</l>

     <l n="67">So swift , so pure , so cold , so bright ,</l>
     <l n="68">They pierced my frame with icy wound ;</l>
     <l n="69">And all that half-year 's polar night ,</l>

     <l n="71">Slowly that darkness pass 'd away ,</l>

     <l n="74">But soon as toll 'd the evening bell ,</l>
     <l n="75">They forced me on , where ever dwell</l>
     <l n="76">Far-distant men , in cities fair ,</l>

     <l n="84">The free wind blows — we 've left the town -</l>
     <l n="85">A wild sepulchral ground I mark ,</l>

     <l n="28">In Fairy-land , on wide and cheerless plain ,</l>
     <l n="29">Dwelt , in the house of Care a sturdy swain ;</l>
     <l n="30">A hireling he , who , when he till 'd the soil ,</l>
     <l n="31">Look 'd to the pittance that repaid his toil ,</l>
     <l n="32">And to a master left the mingled joy</l>
     <l n="33">And anxious care that follow 'd his employ .</l>
     <l n="34">Sullen and patient he at once appear 'd ,</l>
     <l n="35">As one who murmur 'd , yet as one who fear 'd ;</l>
     <l n="36">Th'attire was coarse that clothed his sinewy frame ,</l>
     <l n="37">Rude his address , and Poverty his name .</l>
     <l n="38">In that same plain a nymph , of curious taste ,</l>
     <l n="39">A cottage ( plann 'd , with all her skill ) had placed ;</l>
     <l n="40">Strange the materials , and for what design 'd</l>
     <l n="41">The various parts , no simple man might find ;</l>
     <l n="42">What seem 'd the door , each entering guest withstood ,</l>
     <l n="43">What seem 'd a window was but painted wood ;</l>
     <l n="44">But by a secret spring the wall would move ,</l>
     <l n="45">And daylight drop through glassy door above :</l>
     <l n="46">‘ Twas all her pride , new traps for praise to lay ,</l>
     <l n="47">And all her wisdom was to hide her way ;</l>
     <l n="48">In small attempts incessant were her pains ,</l>
     <l n="49">And Cunning was her name among the swains .</l>
     <l n="50">Now , whether fate decreed this pair should wed ,</l>
     <l n="51">And blindly drove them to the marriage bed ;</l>
     <l n="52">Or whether love in some soft hour inclined</l>
     <l n="53">The damsel 's heart , and won her to be kind ,</l>
     <l n="54">Is yet unsung : they were an ill-match 'd pair ,</l>
     <l n="55">But both disposed to wed — and wed they were .</l>
     <l n="56">Yet , though united in their fortune , still</l>
     <l n="57">Their ways were diverse ; varying was their will ;</l>
     <l n="58">Nor long the maid had bless 'd the simple man ,</l>
     <l n="59">Before dissensions rose , and she began : -</l>
     <l n="60">“ Wretch that I am ! since to thy fortune bound ,</l>
     <l n="61">What plan , what project , with success is crown 'd ?</l>
     <l n="62">I , who a thousand secret arts possess ,</l>
     <l n="63">Who every rank approach with right address ;</l>
     <l n="64">Who 've loosed a guinea from a miser 's chest ,</l>
     <l n="65">And worm 'd his secret from a traitor 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="66">Thence gifts and gains collecting , great and small ,</l>
     <l n="67">Have brought to thee , and thou consum'st them all ;</l>
     <l n="68">For want like thine — a bog without a base -</l>
     <l n="69">Ingulfs all gains I gather for the place ;</l>
     <l n="70">Feeding , unfill 'd ; destroying , undestroy 'd ;</l>
     <l n="71">It craves for ever , and is ever void : -</l>
     <l n="72">Wretch that I am ! what misery have I found ,</l>
     <l n="73">Since my sure craft was to thy calling bound ! ”</l>
     <l n="74">“ Oh ! vaunt of worthless art , ” the swain replied ,</l>
     <l n="75">Scowling contempt , “ how pitiful this pride !</l>
     <l n="76">What are these specious gifts , these paltry gains ,</l>
     <l n="77">But base rewards for ignominious pains ?</l>
     <l n="78">With all thy tricking , still for bread we strive ,</l>
     <l n="79">Thine is , proud wretch ! the care that cannot thrive ;</l>
     <l n="80">By all thy boasted skill and baffled hooks ,</l>
     <l n="81">Thou gain'st no more than students by their books .</l>
     <l n="82">No more than I for my poor deeds am paid ,</l>
     <l n="83">Whom none can blame , will help , or dare upbraid .</l>
     <l n="84">“ Call this our need , a bog that all devours , -</l>
     <l n="85">Then what thy petty arts , but summer-flowers ,</l>
     <l n="86">Gaudy and mean , and serving to betray</l>
     <l n="87">The place they make unprofitably gay ?</l>
     <l n="88">Who know it not , some useless beauties see , -</l>
     <l n="89">But ah ! to prove it was reserved for me . ”</l>
     <l n="90">Unhappy state ! that , in decay of love ,</l>
     <l n="91">Permits harsh truth his errors to disprove ;</l>
     <l n="92">While he remains , to wrangle and to jar ,</l>
     <l n="93">Is friendly tournament , not fatal war ;</l>
     <l n="94">Love in his play will borrow arms of hate ,</l>
     <l n="95">Anger and rage , upbraiding and debate ;</l>
     <l n="96">And by his power the desperate weapons thrown ,</l>
     <l n="97">Become as safe and pleasant as his own ;</l>
     <l n="98">But left by him , their natures they assume ,</l>
     <l n="99">And fatal , in their poisoning force , become .</l>
     <l n="100">Time fled , and now the swain compell 'd to see</l>
     <l n="101">New cause for fear — “ Is this thy thrift ? ” quoth he ,</l>
     <l n="102">To whom the wife with cheerful voice replied : -</l>
     <l n="103">“ Thou moody man , lay all thy fears aside ;</l>
     <l n="104">I 've seen a vision — they , from whom I came ,</l>
     <l n="105">A daughter promise , promise wealth and fame ;</l>
     <l n="106">Born with my features , with my arts , yet she</l>
     <l n="107">Shall patient , pliant , persevering be ,</l>
     <l n="108">And in thy better ways resemble thee .</l>
     <l n="109">The fairies round shall at her birth attend ,</l>
     <l n="110">The friend of all in all shall find a friend ,</l>
     <l n="111">And save that one sad star that hour must gleam</l>
     <l n="112">On our fair child , how glorious were my dream ? ”</l>
     <l n="113">This heard the husband , and , in surly smile ,</l>
     <l n="114">Aim 'd at contempt , but yet he hoped the while ;</l>
     <l n="115">For as , when sinking , wretched men are found</l>
     <l n="116">To catch at rushes rather than be drown 'd ;</l>
     <l n="117">So on a dream our peasant placed his hope ,</l>
     <l n="118">And found that rush as valid as a rope .</l>
     <l n="119">Swift fled the days , for now in hope they fled ,</l>
     <l n="120">When a fair daughter bless 'd the nuptial bed ;</l>
     <l n="121">Her infant-face the mother 's pains beguiled ,</l>
     <l n="122">She look 'd so pleasing and so softly smiled ;</l>
     <l n="123">Those smiles , those looks , with sweet sensations moved</l>
     <l n="124">The gazer 's soul , and as he look 'd he loved .</l>
     <l n="125">And now the fairies came with gifts , to grace</l>
     <l n="126">So mild a nature , and so fair a face .</l>
     <l n="127">They gave , with beauty , that bewitching art ,</l>
     <l n="128">That holds in easy chains the human heart ;</l>
     <l n="129">They gave her skill to win the stubborn mind ,</l>
     <l n="130">To make the suffering to their sorrows blind ,</l>
     <l n="131">To bring on pensive looks the pleasing smile ,</l>
     <l n="132">And Care 's stern brow of every frown beguile .</l>
     <l n="133">These magic favours graced the infant-maid ,</l>
     <l n="134">Whose more enlivening smile the charming gifts repaid .</l>
     <l n="135">Now Fortune changed , who , were she constant long ,</l>
     <l n="136">Would leave us few adventures for our song .</l>
     <l n="137">A wicked elfin roved this land around ,</l>
     <l n="138">Whose joys proceeded from the griefs he found ;</l>
     <l n="139">Envy his name : — his fascinating eye</l>
     <l n="140">From the light bosom drew the sudden sigh ;</l>
     <l n="141">Unsocial he , but with malignant mind ,</l>
     <l n="142">He dwelt with man , that he might curse mankind ;</l>
     <l n="143">Like the first foe , he sought th ’ abode of Joy</l>
     <l n="144">Grieved to behold , but eager to destroy ;</l>
     <l n="145">Round blooming beauty , like the wasp , he flew ,</l>
     <l n="146">Soil 'd the fresh sweet , and changed the rosy hue ;</l>
     <l n="147">The wise , the good , with anxious heart he saw ,</l>
     <l n="148">And here a failing found , and there a flaw ;</l>
     <l n="149">Discord in families ‘ twas his to move ,</l>
     <l n="150">Distrust in friendship , jealousy in love ;</l>
     <l n="151">He told the poor , what joys the great possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="152">The great , what calm content the cottage bless 'd :</l>
     <l n="153">To part the learned and the rich he tried ,</l>
     <l n="154">Till their slow friendship perish 'd in their pride .</l>
     <l n="155">Such was the fiend , and so secure of prey ,</l>
     <l n="156">That only Misery pass 'd unstung away .</l>
     <l n="157">Soon as he heard the fairy-babe was born ,</l>
     <l n="158">Scornful he smiled , but felt no more than scorn :</l>
     <l n="159">For why , when Fortune placed her state so low ,</l>
     <l n="160">In useless spite his lofty malice show ?</l>
     <l n="161">Why , in a mischief of the meaner kind ,</l>
     <l n="162">Exhaust the vigour of a ranc'rous mind ;</l>
     <l n="163">But , soon as Fame the fairy-gifts proclaim 'd ,</l>
     <l n="164">Quick-rising wrath his ready soul inflamed</l>
     <l n="165">To swear , by vows that e'en the wicked tie ,</l>
     <l n="166">The nymph should weep her varied destiny ;</l>
     <l n="167">That every gift , that now appear 'd to shine</l>
     <l n="168">In her fair face , and make her smiles divine ,</l>
     <l n="169">Should all the poison of his magic prove ,</l>
     <l n="170">And they should scorn her , whom she sought for love .</l>
     <l n="171">His spell prepared , in form an ancient dame ,</l>
     <l n="172">A fiend in spirit , to the cot he came ;</l>
     <l n="173">There gain 'd admittance , and the infant press 'd</l>
     <l n="174">( Muttering his wicked magic ) to his breast ;</l>
     <l n="175">And thus he said : — “ Of all the powers who wait</l>
     <l n="176">On Jove 's decrees , and do the work of fate ,</l>
     <l n="177">Was I , alone , despised or worthless , found ,</l>
     <l n="178">Weak to protect , or impotent to wound ?</l>
     <l n="179">See then thy foe , regret the friendship lost ,</l>
     <l n="180">And learn my skill , but learn it at your cost .</l>
     <l n="181">“ Know , then , O child ! devote to fates severe ,</l>
     <l n="182">The good shall hate thy name , the wise shall fear ;</l>
     <l n="183">Wit shall deride , and no protecting friend</l>
     <l n="184">Thy shame shall cover , or thy name defend .</l>
     <l n="185">Thy gentle sex , who , more than ours , should spare</l>
     <l n="186">A humble foe , will greater scorn declare ;</l>
     <l n="187">The base alone thy advocates shall be ,</l>
     <l n="188">Or boast alliance with a wretch like thee . ”</l>
     <l n="189">He spake , and vanish 'd , other prey to find ,</l>
     <l n="190">And waste in slow disease the conquer 'd mind .</l>
     <l n="191">Awed by the elfin 's threats , and fill 'd with dread</l>
     <l n="192">The parents wept , and sought their infant 's bed ;</l>
     <l n="193">Despair alone the father 's soul possess 'd ;</l>
     <l n="194">But hope rose gently in the mother 's breast ;</l>
     <l n="195">For well she knew that neither grief nor joy</l>
     <l n="196">Pain 'd without hope , or pleased without alloy ;</l>
     <l n="197">And while these hopes and fears her heart divide ,</l>
     <l n="198">A cheerful vision bade the fears subside .</l>
     <l n="199">She saw descending to the world below</l>
     <l n="200">An ancient form , with solemn pace and slow .</l>
     <l n="201">“ Daughter , no more be sad ” ( the phantom cried ) ,</l>
     <l n="202">“ Success is seldom to the wise denied ;</l>
     <l n="203">In idle wishes fools supinely stay ,</l>
     <l n="204">Be there a will , and wisdom finds a way :</l>
     <l n="205">Why art thou grieved ? Be rather glad , that he</l>
     <l n="206">Who hates the happy , aims his darts at thee ,</l>
     <l n="207">But aims in vain ; thy favour 'd daughter lies</l>
     <l n="208">Serenely blest , and shall to joy arise .</l>
     <l n="209">For , grant that curses on her name shall wait ,</l>
     <l n="210">( So Envy wills , and such the voice of Fate ,)</l>
     <l n="211">Yet if that name be prudently suppress 'd ,</l>
     <l n="212">She shall be courted , favour 'd , and caress 'd .</l>
     <l n="213">“ For what are names ? and where agree mankind ,</l>
     <l n="214">In those to persons or to acts assign 'd ?</l>
     <l n="215">Brave , learn 'd , or wise , if some their favourites call ,</l>
     <l n="216">Have they the titles or the praise from all ?</l>
     <l n="217">Not so , but others will the brave disdain</l>
     <l n="218">As rash , and deem the sons of wisdom vain ;</l>
     <l n="219">The self-same mind shall scorn or kindness move ,</l>
     <l n="220">And the same deed attract contempt and love .</l>
     <l n="221">“ So all the powers who move the human soul ,</l>
     <l n="222">With all the passions who the will control ,</l>
     <l n="223">Have various names — One giv'n by Truth Divine ,</l>
     <l n="224">( As Simulation thus was fixed for mine ,)</l>

     <l n="226">My secret counsels , now as art despise ;</l>
     <l n="227">One hour , as just , those counsels they embrace ,</l>

     <l n="229">Thee , too , my child , those fools as Cunning fly ,</l>
     <l n="230">Who on thy counsel and thy craft rely ;</l>
     <l n="231">That worthy craft in others they condemn ,</l>

     <l n="235">Let all be true that Envy dooms , yet all ,</l>
     <l n="236">Not on herself , but on her name , shall fall ;</l>

     <l n="239">“ O happy child ! the glorious day shall shine ,</l>
     <l n="240">When every ear shall to thy speech incline ,</l>

     <l n="242">The sullen pedant and the sprightly wit ,</l>
     <l n="243">To hear thy soothing eloquence shall sit ;</l>

   <p>{ 1 } It has been suggested to me , that this change from restlessness to repose , in the mind of Sir Eustace , is wrought by a Methodistic call ; and it is admitted to be such : a sober and rational conversion could not have happened while the disorder of the brain continued : yet the verses which follow , in a different measure , are not intended to make any religious persuasion appear ridiculous ; they are to be supposed as the effect of memory in the disordered mind of the speaker , and , though evidently enthusiastic in respect to language , are not meant to convey any impropriety of sentiment .</p>
