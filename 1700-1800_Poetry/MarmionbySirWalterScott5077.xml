    <docImprint>EDITOR 'S PREFACE . I. SCOTT AT ASHESTIEL .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Sir Walter Scott 's love of the country induced him , after his marriage in 1797 , to settle in a cottage at the pretty village of Lasswade , near Edinburgh . Four years after leaving this district he took Mr. Morritt of Rokeby to see the little dwelling , telling him that , though not worth looking at , ‘ it was our first house when newly married , and many a contrivance it had to make it comfortable . ’ He then enumerated various devices , by which he had secured for Mrs. Scott and himself what seemed to both , at the time , additional convenience and elegance in and about their home . His reminiscences culminated in an account of an arch over the gate-way , which he had constructed by fastening together the tops of two convenient willows and placing above them ‘ a cross made of two sticks . ’ This is very beautiful and characteristic ; and there is much freshness and charm in the further picture of the young cottagers rejoicing over the success of the arrangements . ‘ To be sure , ’ Scott concluded , ‘ it is not much of a lion to show a stranger ; but I wanted to see it again myself , for I assure you after I constructed it , Mamma ( Mrs. Scott ) and I both of us thought it so fine , we turned out to see it by moonlight , and walked backwards from it to the cottage-door in admiration of our own magnificence and its picturesque effect . ’ It was his way to invest his circumstances with an interest over and above what intrinsically belonged to them , and to prompt his friends to a share in his delight .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>When , in<date>1804</date>, Scott was appointed Sheriff of Selkirkshire , a condition attaching to his post was that he should reside during part of the year within the bounds of his sheriffdom . He then removed from Lasswade , and settled at Ashestiel on the Tweed , seven miles from Selkirk . This is his own account of the new home :— ‘ We found a delightful retirement , by my becoming the tenant of my intimate friend and cousin-german , Colonel Russell , in his mansion of Ashestiel , which was unoccupied during his absence on military service in India . The house was adequate to our accommodation , and the exercise of a limited hospitality . The situation is uncommonly beautiful , by the side of a fine river , whose streams are there very favourable for angling , surrounded by the remains of natural woods , and by hills abounding in game . In point of society , according to the heartfelt phrase of Scripture , we dwelt “ amongst our own people ” ; and as the distance from the metropolis was only thirty miles , we were not out of reach of our Edinburgh friends , in which city we spent the terms of the summer and winter Sessions of the Court , that is , five or six months in the year . ’ The functions of the Sheriff of Selkirkshire admitted of considerable leisure , and Scott settled at Ashestiel full of literary projects , as well as heartily prepared to meet his new responsibilities and to add to his numerous and valuable friendships . An enterprise that early engaged his attention was a complete edition of the British poets , but the deliberations on the subject came to nothing except in so far as they helped towards the preparation of Campbell 's ‘ Specimens of the British Poets , ’ which appeared in<date>1819</date>. Writing Scott regarding his project of a complete edition of the poets , his friend George Ellis said , ‘ Much as I wish for a corpus poetarum , edited as you would edit it , I should like still better another Minstrel Lay by the last and best Minstrel ; and the general demand for the poem seems to prove that the public are of my opinion . ’ The work of editing , however , he seemed at the time determined on having , and he finally abandoned the idea of an exhaustive issue of the British poetry previous to his own time and settled down to edit Dryden . This was a work much needed , and Scott did it extremely well , as may be seen by comparing his own issue of Dryden 's Life and Works in<date>1808</date>with the recent reproduction of it , admirably edited by Mr. George Saintsbury . He had likewise , as he mentions in the General Preface to the Novels , begun Waverley ‘ about<date>1805</date>, ’ and other literary engagements received their share of attention . He wrote articles for the Edinburgh Review , besides doing such minor if useful literary service as editing for Constable ‘ Original Memoirs written during the Great Civil Wars , ’ and so on . At the same time , there were prospects of professional advancement , an account of which he gives in the following terms , in the<date>1830</date>Introduction to ‘ Marmion ':— ‘ An important circumstance had , about the same time , taken place in my life . Hopes had been held out to me from an influential quarter , of a nature to relieve me from the anxiety which I must have otherwise felt , as one upon the precarious tenure of whose own life rested the principal prospects of his family , and especially as one who had necessarily some dependence upon the favour of the public , which is proverbially capricious ; though it is but justice to add , that , in my own case , I have not found it so . Mr. Pitt had expressed a wish to my personal friend , the Right Hon . William Dundas , now Lord Clerk Register of Scotland , that some fitting opportunity should be taken to be of service to me ; and as my views and wishes pointed to a future rather than an immediate provision , an opportunity of accomplishing this was soon found . One of the Principal Clerks of Session , as they are called , ( official persons who occupy an important and responsible situation , and enjoy a considerable income ,) who had served upwards of thirty years , felt himself , from age , and the infirmity of deafness with which it was accompanied , desirous of retiring from his official situation . As the law then stood , such official persons were entitled to bargain with their successors , either for a sum of money , which was usually a considerable one , or for an interest in the emoluments of the office during their life . My predecessor , whose services had been unusually meritorious , stipulated for the emoluments of his office during his life , while I should enjoy the survivorship , on the condition that I discharged the duties of the office in the meantime . Mr. Pitt , however , having died in the interval , his administration was dissolved , and was succeeded by that known by the name of the Fox and Grenville Ministry . My affair was so far completed , that my commission lay in the office subscribed by his Majesty ; but , from hurry or mistake , the interest of my predecessor was not expressed in it , as had been usual in such cases . Although , therefore , it only required payment of the fees , I could not in honour take out the commission in the present state , since , in the event of my dying before him , the gentleman whom I succeeded must have lost the vested interest which he had stipulated to retain . I had the honour of an interview with Earl Spencer on the subject , and he , in the most handsome manner , gave directions that the commission should issue as originally intended ; adding , that the matter having received the royal assent , he regarded only as a claim of justice what he would have willingly done as an act of favour . I never saw Mr. Fox on this , or on any other occasion , and never made any application to him , conceiving that in doing so I might have been supposed to express political opinions contrary to those which I had always professed . In his private capacity , there is no man to whom I would have been more proud to owe an obligation , had I been so distinguished . ‘ By this arrangement I obtained the survivorship of an office , the emoluments of which were fully adequate to my wishes ; and as the law respecting the mode of providing for superannuated officers was , about five or six years after , altered from that which admitted the arrangement of assistant and successor , my colleague very handsomely took the opportunity of the alteration , to accept of the retiring annuity provided in such cases , and admitted me to the full benefit of the office . ’ At Ashestiel Scott systematically planned his day . He had his mornings for his multifarious work , and the after part of the day was given to necessary recreation and to his friends . He was an ardent member of the Edinburgh Light Horse , at a time when volunteers of a practical and energetic character seemed likely to be needed , and at Ashestiel he combined a certain military routine with his legal and literary arrangements . James Skene of Rubislaw , one of his best friends and most frequent visitors , mentions that ‘ before beginning his desk-work in the morning he uniformly visited his favourite steed , and neither Captain nor Lieutenant , nor the Lieutenant 's successor , Brown Adam ( so called after one of the heroes of the Minstrelsy ) , liked to be fed except by him . ’ Skene is the friend to whom Scott addresses the Introduction to Canto IV , charged with touching and beautiful reminiscences of earlier days . They were comrades in the Edinburgh Light Horse Volunteers , Scott being Quartermaster and Skene Cornet . Their friendship had been one of eleven years ’ standing when the dedicatory epistle was written :— ‘ Eleven years we now may tell , Since we have known each other well ; Since , riding side by side , our hand First drew the voluntary brand . ’ With regard to the Introductions , it may now be said that they are better where they are than if the poet had published them separately , as at one time he seems to have intended ( see Notes , p. 187 ) . It is sometimes said by those anxious to learn the story that these introductory Epistles should be steadily ignored , and the cantos read in strict succession . In answer to an assertion of opinion like this , it is hardly necessary to say more than that probably those interested in the narrative alone could not do better than avoid the Introductions . But it will be well for them to miss various other things besides : will they , for example , care for the impassioned address of Constance to her judges , for the landlord 's tale of grammarye , for Sir David Lyndsay 's narrative , or even for the many descriptive passages that interrupt the free progress of the tale ? Their reading would appear to be done on the plan of those who get through novels , or other works of imagination , by carefully omitting the dialogue and all those passages in which the author pauses to describe or to reflect . It is needless to say that this is not the spirit in which to approach ‘ Marmion ’ as it stands . Scott wrote with his friends about him , and it was part of his own enjoyment of his work to interest them in what for the time was receiving the main part of his attention . His talk with Mr. Morritt in front of the little cottage at Lasswade is highly significant as illustrative of his attitude towards his friends . His healthy , humorous , happy nature wanted sympathy , appreciation , sociality , and good cheer for its complete normal development , and this alone would explain the writing of the Introductions . But there is more than this . He talked over his subject and his progress with friends competent to discuss and advise , and he showed them portions of the poem as he advanced . There are indications in the Introductions of certain discussions that had arisen over his conception and treatment , and surely few readers would like to miss from the volume the clever and humorous apology for his own method which the poet advances in the Introduction to the third canto . William Erskine , refined critic and life-long friend , is asked to be patient and generous while the poet proceeds in his own way :— ‘ Still kind , as is thy wont , attend , And in the minstrel spare the friend , Though wild as cloud , as stream , as gale , Flow forth , flow unrestrain 'd , my Tale ! ’ Further , the Introductions do not in any case interrupt the progress of the Poem . Scott was dealing with a great national theme — a cause he and his friends could understand and appreciate — and both before starting and at every pause he has something to say that is apposite and suggestive . His country 's wintry state is the key-note of the first Introduction , which is an appropriate prelude to a great national tragedy ; weird Border legends and the touching and mysterious silences of lone St. Mary 's Lake fitly introduce the ‘ mysterious Man of Woe ’ ; the third and the fourth Introductions , with their features of personal interest and their bright reminiscences of ‘ tales that charmed ’ and scenes on ‘ the field-day , or the drill , ’ are easily connected with the Hostel and the Camp ; Spenser 's ‘ wandering Squire of Dames , ’ the vigorous description of the ‘ Queen of the North , ’ and the tribute to the notes that ‘ Marie translated , Blondel sung , ’ all tell in their due place as preparatory to the canto on The Court ; while the ominous record , emanating from a Yule-tide retreat , could not be more fitly interrupted than by a battle of national disaster . Scott , then , may have thought of publishing the Introductions separately , but it is well that he ultimately allowed his better judgment to prevail . It is not necessary to dwell on their special descriptive features , which readily assert themselves and give Scott a high and honoured place among Nature-poets . His quick and minute observation , his sense of colour and harmonious effects , and his skill of arrangement are admirable throughout . II . COMPOSITION OF ‘ MARMION . ’ In<date>1791</date>Scott accompanied an uncle into Northumberland , and made his first acquaintance with the scene of Flodden . Writing to his friend William Clerk ( Lockhart 's Life , ii . 182 ) , he says , ‘ Never was an affair more completely bungled than that day 's work was . Suppose one army posted upon the face of a hill , and secured by high grounds projecting on each flank , with the river Till in front , a deep and still river , winding through a very extensive valley called Milfield Plain , and the only passage over it by a narrow bridge , which the Scots artillery , from the hill , could in a moment have demolished . Add that the English must have hazarded a battle while their troops , which were tumultuously levied , remained together ; and that the Scots , behind whom the country was open to Scotland , had nothing to do but to wait for the attack as they were posted . Yet did two - thirds of the army , actuated by the perfervidum ingenium Scotorum , rush down and give an opportunity to Stanley to occupy the ground they had quitted , by coming over the shoulder of the hill , while the other third , under Lord Home , kept their ground , and having seen their King and about 10 , 000 of their countrymen cut to pieces , retired into Scotland without loss . ’ Fifteen years after this was written Scott began the composition of ‘ Marmion , ’ and it is interesting to note that , so early in life as the date of this letter indicates , he was so keenly alive to the great blunder in military tactics made by James IV and his advisers , and so manifestly stirred to eloquent expression of his feeling . In November<date>1806</date>Scott began ‘ Marmion , ’ designed as a romance of Feudalism to succeed the Border study in ‘ The Lay of the Last Minstrel . ’ The circumstances of the time , no doubt , to some extent prompted the choice of subject . Napoleon was diligently working out his ambitious scheme of a Western Empire , and plotting the ruin of Great Britain as an indispensable feature of the arrangement . Scott was not always intimately acquainted with the details of current politics , but when a subject fairly roused his interest he was not slow to take part in its discussion . This is notably illustrated , in this very year<date>1806</date>, by the outspoken and energetic political ballad he produced over the acquittal of Lord Melville from a serious charge . This ballad , which went very straight to the heart of its subject , and left no doubt as to the party feeling of the writer , not only arrested general attention but gave considerable offence to the leaders on the side so sharply handled . It is given , with an explanation of the circumstances that called it forth , in Lockhart 's Life , ii . 106 ,<date>1837</date>ed . While , however , party politics was not always a subject that interested Scott , patriotism was a constituent element of his character . He had a keen sense of national dignity and honour — as the extract from his Flodden letter alone sufficiently testifies — and , had circumstances demanded it of him , he would almost certainly have distinguished himself as a trooper on the field of battle . Thus it was not only his love of a picturesque theme that inspired him with his Tale of Flodden Field , but likewise his patriotic ardour and his desire to touch the national heart . ‘ Marmion ’ is epical in character and movement ; and it is at the same time a brilliant and suggestive delineation of a national effort , illustrating keen sense of honour , resolute purpose , and pathetic manly devotion . James IV was probably wrong , and he was certainly very rash , in attempting to do battle with Henry VIII , but although his people were aware of his mistake , and his advisers did all in their power to dissuade him , he was supported to the last with a heroism that recalls Thermopylae . This was a display of national character that appealed directly and powerfully to Scott , prompting him to the production of his loftiest and most energetic verse . Mournful associations will ever cluster around the tragic battle of Flodden — that ‘ most dolent day , ’ as Lyndsay aptly calls it — but all the same the record remains of what heroic men had it in them to do for King and country , where ‘ Groom fought like noble , squire like knight , As fearlessly and well . ’ Scott intended to work slowly and carefully through his new poem , but , as he explains in the<date>1830</date>Introduction , circumstances interrupted his design . ‘ Particular passages , ’ he says , ‘ of a poem , which was finally called “ Marmion , ” were laboured with a good deal of care , by one by whom much care was seldom bestowed . ’ The publication , however , was hastened by ‘ the misfortunes of a near relation and friend . ’ Lockhart ( Life , ii . 115 ) explains that the reference is to ‘ his brother Thomas 's final withdrawal from the profession of Writer to the Signet , which arrangement seems to have been quite necessary towards the end of<date>1806</date>. ’ At any rate , the poem was finished in a shorter time than had been at first intended . The subject suited Scott so exactly that , even in default of a special stimulus , there need be no surprise at the rapidity of his composition after he had fairly begun to move forward with it . Dryden , it may be remembered , was so held and fascinated by his ‘ Alexander 's Feast ’ that he wrote it off in a night . Cowper had a similar experience with ‘ John Gilpin , ’ and Burns 's powerful dramatic tale , ‘ Tam O'Shanter , ’ was produced with great ease and rapidity . De Quincey records that , in his own case , his very best work was frequently done when he was writing against time . Scott 's energy and fluency of composition are clearly indicated in the following passage in Lockharts Life , ii . 117 :—</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>‘ When the theme was of a more stirring order , he enjoyed pursuing it over brake and fell at the full speed of his Lieutenant . I well remember his saying , as I rode with him across the hills from Ashestiel to Newark one day in his declining years — “ Oh , man , I had many a grand gallop among these braes when I was thinking of ‘ Marmion , ’ but a trotting canny pony must serve me now . ” His friend , Mr. Skene , however , informs me that many of the more energetic descriptions , and particularly that of the battle of Flodden , were struck out while he was in quarters again with his cavalry , in the autumn of 1807 . “ In the intervals of drilling , ” he says , “ Scott used to delight in walking his powerful black steed up and down by himself upon the Portobello sands , within the beating of the surge ; and now and then you would see him plunge in his spurs and go off as if at the charge , with the spray dashing about him . As we rode back to Musselburgh , he often came and placed himself beside me to repeat the verses that he had been composing during these pauses of our exercise . " ’</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>This is wholly in keeping with the production of such poetry of movement as that of ‘ Marmion , ’ and it deserves its due place in estimating the work of Scott , just as Wordsworth 's staid and sober walks around his garden , or among the hills by which he was surrounded , are carefully considered in connexion with his deliberate , meditative verse . Scott wrote the Introduction to Canto IV just a year after he had begun the poem , and between that time and the middle of February<date>1808</date>the work was finished . There is no rashness in saying that rapidity of production did not detract from excellence of result . Indeed , it is admiration rather than criticism that is challenged by the reflection that , in these short months , the poet should have turned out so much verse of high and enduring quality . III . CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POEM .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>‘ Marmion ’ is avowedly a descriptive poem . It is a series of skilful and impressive pictures , not only remarkable in themselves , but conspicuous in their own kind in poetical literature . Scott is said to have been deficient , or at any rate imperfectly trained , in certain sense activities , but there is no denying his quick perception of colour and his strong sense of the leading points in a landscape . Even minute features are seized and utilized with ease and precision , while the larger elements of a scene are depicted with breadth , sense of proportion , and clearness and impressiveness of arrangement . This holds true whether the description is merely a vivid presentment of what the imagination of the poet calls from the remote past , or a delineation of what has actually come under his notice . Norham at twilight , with the solitary warder on the battlements , and Crichtoun castle , as Scott himself saw it , instantly commend themselves by their realistic vigour and their consistent verisimilitude . Any visitor to Norham will still be able to imagine the stir and the imposing spectacle described in the opening stanzas of the first canto ; and it is a pleasure to follow Scott 's minute and faithful picture of Crichtoun by examining the imposing ruin as it stands at the present day . Then it is impossible not to feel that the Edinburgh of the sixteenth century was exactly as it is depicted in the poem , and that the troops on the Borough Moor were disposed as seen by the trained military eye of Sir Walter Scott . It would be difficult to find anywhere a more striking ancient stronghold than Tantallon , nor would it be easy to conceive a more appropriate scene for that grim and exciting morning interview in which the venerable Douglas found that he had harboured a recreant knight . Above all , there is the great battle scene , standing alone in literature for its carefully detailed delineation - - its persistent minuteness , its rapidity of movement , its balanced effects , its energetic purpose — and surpassing everything in modern verse for its vivid Homeric realism . Fifteen years before , as we have seen , Scott had the progress of the battle in his mind 's eye , and at length he produced his description as if he had been present in the character of a skilful and interested spectator . There are envious people who decline to admit that Scott discovered his scenery , and who contend that others knew all about it before and appreciated it in their own way . Be it so ; and yet the fact remains that Scott likewise saw and appreciated in the way peculiar to him , and thereby enabled his numerous readers to share his enjoyment . A very interesting and suggestive account of the new popularity given to the Flodden district by the publication of ‘ Marmion ’ will be found in Lockhart 's Life , iii . 12 . In the autumn of 1812 Scott visited Rokeby , doing the journey on horseback , along with his eldest boy and girl on ponies . The following is an episode of the way :— ‘ Halting at Flodden to expound the field of battle to his young folks , he found that “ Marmion ” had , as might have been expected , benefited the keeper of the public-house there very largely ; and the village Boniface , overflowing with gratitude , expressed his anxiety to have a Scott 's Head for his sign-post . The poet demurred to this proposal , and assured mine host that nothing could be more appropriate than the portraiture of a foaming tankard , which already surmounted his doorway . “ Why , the painter man has not made an ill job , ” said the landlord , “ but I would fain have something more connected with the book that has brought me so much good custom . ” He produced a well-thumbed copy , and handing it to the author , begged he would at least suggest a motto from the Tale of Flodden Field . Scott opened the book at the death-scene of the hero , and his eye was immediately caught by the “ inscription ” in black letter :— “ Drink , weary pilgrim , drink , and pray For the kind soul of Sibyl Grey , ” &amp; c. “ Well , my friend , ” said he , “ what more would you have ? You need but strike out one letter in the first of these lines , and make your painter-man , the next time he comes this way , print between the jolly tankard and your own name :— ‘ Drink , weary pilgrim , drink , and PAY . ’ ” Scott was delighted to find , on his return , that this suggestion had been adopted , and for aught I know the romantic legend may still be visible . ’ The characters in the poem are hardly less vigorous in conception and presentation than the descriptions . It may be true , as Carlyle asserts in his ungenerous essay on Scott , that he was inferior to Shakespeare in delineation of character , but , even admitting that , we shall still have ample room for approval and admiration of his work . So far as the purposes of the poem are concerned the various personages are admirably utilized . We come to know Marmion himself very intimately , the interest gradually deepening as the real character of the Palmer and his relations to the hero are steadily developed . These two take prominent rank with the imaginary characters of literature . James IV , that ‘ champion of the dames , ’ and likewise undoubted military leader , is faithfully delineated in accordance with historical records and contemporary estimates . Those desirous of seeing him as he struck the imagination of a poet in his own day should read the eulogy passed upon him by Barclay in his ‘ Ship of Fools . ’ The passage in which this occurs is an interpolation in the division of the poem entitled ‘ Of the Ruine and Decay of the Holy Faith Catholique . ’ The other characters are all distinctly suited to the parts they have to perform . Acting on the licence sanctioned by Horatian authority :— ‘ Atque ita mentitur , sic veris falsa remiscet , Primo ne medium , medio ne discrepet imum ’ — Scott appropriates Sir David Lyndsay to his purpose , presenting him , even as he presents the stately and venerable Angus , with faithful and striking picturesqueness . Bishop Douglas is exactly suited to his share in the development of events ; and had room likewise been found for the Court poet Dunbar — author of James 's Epithalamium , the ‘ Thrissill and the Rois ’ — it would have been both a fit and a seemly arrangement . Had Scott remembered that Dunbar was a favourite of Queen Margaret 's he might have introduced him into an interesting episode . The passage devoted to the Queen herself is exquisite and graceful , its restrained and effective pathos making a singularly direct and significant appeal . The other female characters are well conceived and sustained , while Constance in the Trial scene reaches an imposing height of dramatic intensity . After the descriptions and the characterisation , the remaining important features of the poem are its marked practical irony and its episodes . Marmion , despite his many excellences , is throughout - - and for obvious reasons — the victim of a persistent Nemesis . Scott is much interested in his hero ; one fancies that if it were only possible he would in the end extend his favour to him , and grant him absolution ; but his sense of artistic fitness prevails , and he will abate no jot of the painful ordeal to which he feels bound to submit him . Marmion is a knight with a claim to nothing more than the half of the proverbial qualifications . He is sans peur , but not sans reproche ; and it is one expression of the practical irony that constantly lurks to assail him that even his fearlessness quails for a time before the Phantom Knight on Gifford Moor . The whole attitude of the Palmer is ironical ; and , after the bitter parting with Angus at Tantallon , Marmion is weighted with the depressing reflection that numerous forces are conspiring against him , and with the knowledge that it is his old rival De Wilton that has thrown off the Palmer 's disguise and preceded him to the scene of war . In his last hour the practical irony of his position bears upon him with a concentration of keen and bitter thrusts . Clare , whom he intended to defraud , ministers to his last needs ; he learns that Constance died a bitter death at Lindisfarne ; and just when he recognises his greatest need of strength his life speedily ebbs away . There is a certain grandeur of impressive tragical effort in his last struggles , as he feels that whatever he may himself have been he suffers in the end from the merciless machinery of a false ecclesiastical system . The practical irony follows him even after his death , for it is a skilful stroke that leaves his neglected remains on the field of battle and places a nameless stranger in his stately tomb . As regards the episodes , it may just be said in a word that they are appropriate , and instead of retarding the movement of the piece , as has sometimes been alleged , they serve to give it breadth and massiveness of effect . Of course , there will always be found those who think them too long , just as there are those whose narrowness of view constrains them to wish the Introductions away . If the poet 's conception of Marmion be fully considered , it will be seen that the Host 's Tale is an integral part of his purpose ; and there is surely no need to defend either Sir David Lyndsay 's Tale or the weird display at the cross of Edinburgh . The episode of Lady Heron 's singing carries its own defence in itself , seeing that the song of ‘ Lochinvar ’ holds a place of distinction among lyrics expressive of poetical motion . After all , we must bear in mind that though it pleases Scott to speak of his tale as flowing on ‘ wild as cloud , as stream , as gale , ’ he was still conscious that he was engaged upon a poem , and that a poem is regulated by certain artistic laws . If we strive to grasp his meaning we shall not be specially inclined to carp at his method . It may at the same time be not unprofitable to look for a moment at some of the notable criticisms of the poem . IV . CRITICISMS OF THE POEM .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>When ‘ Marmion ’ was little more than begun Scott 's publishers offered him a thousand pounds for the copyright , and as this soon became known it naturally gave rise to varied comment . Lord Byron thought it sufficient to warrant a gratuitous attack on the author in his ‘ English Bards and Scotch Reviewers . ’ This is a portion of the passage :— ‘ And think'st thou , Scott ! by vain conceit perchance , On public taste to foist thy stale romance . Though Murray with his Miller may combine To yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line ? No ! when the sons of song descend to trade , Their bays are sear , their former laurels fade . ’ As a matter of fact , there was on Scott 's part no trade whatever in the case . If a publisher chose to secure in advance what he anticipated would be a profitable commodity , that was mainly the publisher 's affair , and the poet would have been a simpleton not to close with the offer if he liked it . Scott admirably disposes of Byron as follows in the<date>1830</date>Introduction :—</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>‘ The publishers of the “ Lay of the Last Minstrel , ” emboldened by the success of that poem , willingly offered a thousand pounds for “ Marmion . ” The transaction being no secret , afforded Lord Byron , who was then at general war with all who blacked paper , an apology for including me in his satire , entitled “ English Bards and Scotch Reviewers . ” I never could conceive how an arrangement between an author and his publishers , if satisfactory to the persons concerned , could afford matter of censure to any third party . I had taken no unusual or ungenerous means of enhancing the value of my merchandise — I had never higgled a moment about the bargain , but accepted at once what I considered the handsome offer of my publishers . These gentlemen , at least , were not of opinion that they had been taken advantage of in the transaction , which indeed was one of their own framing ; on the contrary , the sale of the Poem was so far beyond their expectation , as to induce them to supply the author 's cellars with what is always an acceptable present to a young Scottish housekeeper , namely , a hogshead of excellent claret . ’ A second point on which Scott was attacked was the character of Marmion . It was held that such a knight as he undoubtedly was should have been incapable of forgery . Scott himself ; of course , knew better than his critics whether or not this was the case , but , with his usual good nature and generous regard for the opinion of others , he admitted that perhaps he had committed an artistic blunder . Dr. Leyden , in particular , for whose judgment he had special respect , wrote him from India ‘ a furious remonstrance on the subject . ’ Fortunately , he made no attempt to change what he had written , his main reason being that ‘ corrections , however in themselves judicious , have a bad effect after publication . ’ He might have added that any modification of the hero 's guilt would have entirely altered the character of the poem , and might have ruined it altogether . He had never , apparently , gone into the question thoroughly after his first impressions of the type of knights existing in feudal times , for though he states that ‘ similar instances were found , and might be quoted , ’ he is inclined to admit that the attribution of forgery was a ‘ gross defect . ’ Readers interested in the subject will find by reference to Pike 's ‘ History of Crime , ’ i . 276 , that Scott was perfectly justified in his assumption that a feudal knight was capable of forgery . Those who understand how intimate his knowledge was of the period with which he was dealing will , of course , be the readiest to believe him rather than his critics ; but when he seems doubtful of himself , and ready to yield the point , it is well that the strength of his original position can thus be supported by the results of recent investigation . Jeffrey , in the Edinburgh Review , not being able to understand and appreciate this new devotion to romance , and probably stimulated by his misreading of the reference to Fox in the Introduction to Canto I , did his utmost to cast discredit on ‘ Marmion . ’ Scott was too large a man to confound the separate spheres of Politics and Literature ; whereas it was frequently the case with Jeffrey — as , indeed , it was to some extent with literary critics on the other side as well — to estimate an author 's work in reference to the party in the State to which he was known to belong . It was impossible to deny merits to Scott 's descriptions , and the extraordinary energy of the most striking portions of the Poem , but Jeffrey groaned over the inequalities he professed to discover , and lamented that the poet should waste his strength on the unprofitable effort to resuscitate an old-fashioned enthusiasm . They had been the best of friends previously — and Scott , as we have seen , worked for the Edinburgh Review — but it was now patent that the old literary intimacy could not pleasantly continue . Nor is it surprising that Scott should have felt that the Edinburgh Review had become too autocratic , and that he should have given a helping hand towards the establishing of the Quarterly Review , as a political and literary organ necessary to the balance of parties . V. THE TEXT OF THE POEM .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Scott himself revised ‘ Marmion ’ in<date>1831</date>, and the interleaved copy which he used formed the basis of the text given by Lockhart in the uniform edition of the Poetical Works published in<date>1833</date>. This will remain the standard text . It is that which is followed in the present volume , in which there will be found only three — in reality only two — important instances of divergence from Lockhart 's readings . The earlier editions have been collated with that of<date>1833</date>, and Mr. W. J. Rolfe 's careful and scholarly<settlement>Boston</settlement>edition has likewise been consulted . It has not been considered necessary to follow Mr. Rolfe in several alterations he has made on Lockhart ; but he introduces one emendation which readily commends itself to the reader 's intelligence , and it is adopted in the present volume . This is in the punctuation of the opening lines in the first stanza of Canto II . Lockhart completes a sentence at the end of the fifth line , whereas the sense manifestly carries the period on to the eleventh line . In the third Introd ., line 228 , the reading of the earlier editions is followed in giving ‘ From me ’ instead of ‘ For me , ’ as the meaning is thereby simplified and made more direct . In III . xiv . 234 , the modern versions of Lockhart 's text give ‘ proudest princes VEIL their eyes , ’ where Lockhart himself agrees with the earlier editions in reading ‘ VAIL ’ . The restoration of the latter form needs no defence . The Elizabethan words in the Poem are not infrequent , giving it , as they do , a certain air of archaic dignity , and there can be little doubt that ‘ vail ’ was Scott 's word here , used in its Shakespearian sense of ‘ lower ’ or ‘ cast down , ’ and recalling Venus as ‘ she vailed her eyelids . ’</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>MARMION A TALE OF FLODDEN FIELD IN SIX CANTOS Alas ! that Scottish maid should sing The combat where her lover fell ! That Scottish Bard should wake the string , The triumph of our foes to tell ! LEYDEN . TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY , LORD MONTAGUE &amp; c. &amp; c. &amp; c. THIS ROMANCE IS INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR ADVERTISEMENT It is hardly to be expected , that an Author whom the Public have honoured with some degree of applause , should not be again a trespasser on their kindness . Yet the Author of MARMION must be supposed to feel some anxiety concerning its success , since he is sensible that he hazards , by this second intrusion , any reputation which his first Poem may have procured him . The present story turns upon the private adventures of a fictitious character ; but is called a Tale of Flodden Field , because the hero 's fate is connected with that memorable defeat , and the causes which led to it . The design of the Author was , if possible , to apprize his readers , at the outset , of the date of his Story , and to prepare them for the manners of the Age in which it is laid . Any Historical Narrative , far more an attempt at Epic composition , exceeded his plan of a Romantic Tale ; yet he may be permitted to hope , from the popularity of THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL , that an attempt to paint the manners of the feudal times , upon a broader scale , and in the course of a more interesting story , will not be unacceptable to the Public .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <l n="5">And peopled with the hart and hind .</l>
     <l n="6">Yon Thorn — perchance whose prickly spears 5</l>
     <l n="7">Have fenced him for three hundred years ,</l>

     <l n="15">How broad the shadows of the oak ,</l>
     <l n="16">How clung the rowan to the rock , 15</l>
     <l n="17">And through the foliage show 'd his head ,</l>
     <l n="18">With narrow leaves and berries red ;</l>
     <l n="19">What pines on every mountain sprung ,</l>
     <l n="20">O'er every dell what birches hung ,</l>

     <l n="43">Attentive , as the bratchet 's bay</l>

     <l n="45">To slip them as he broke away .</l>
     <l n="46">The startled quarry bounds amain , 45</l>
     <l n="47">As fast the gallant greyhounds strain ;</l>
     <l n="48">Whistles the arrow from the bow ,</l>
     <l n="49">Answers the harquebuss below ;</l>
     <l n="50">While all the rocking hills reply ,</l>

     <l n="62">O'er holt or hill there never flew ,</l>
     <l n="63">From slip or leash there never sprang ,</l>
     <l n="64">More fleet of foot , or sure of fang .</l>

     <l n="5">Upon the weary waste of snows ,</l>
     <l n="6">A cold and profitless regard , 5</l>

    <head>THE BATTLE .</head>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">While great events were on the gale ,</l>
     <l n="2">And each hour brought a varying tale ,</l>
     <l n="3">And the demeanour , changed and cold ,</l>
     <l n="4">Of Douglas , fretted Marmion bold ,</l>
     <l n="5">And , like the impatient steed of war , 5</l>
     <l n="6">He snuff 'd the battle from afar ;</l>
     <l n="7">And hopes were none , that back again</l>
     <l n="8">Herald should come from Terouenne ,</l>
     <l n="9">Where England 's King in leaguer lay ,</l>
     <l n="10">Before decisive battle-day ; 10</l>
     <l n="11">Whilst these things were , the mournful Clare</l>
     <l n="12">Did in the Dame 's devotions share :</l>
     <l n="13">For the good Countess ceaseless pray 'd</l>
     <l n="14">To Heaven and Saints , her sons to aid .</l>
     <l n="15">And , with short interval , did pass 15</l>
     <l n="16">From prayer to book , from book to mass ,</l>
     <l n="17">And all in high Baronial pride ,—</l>
     <l n="18">A life both dull and dignified ;—</l>
     <l n="19">Yet as Lord Marmion nothing press 'd</l>
     <l n="20">Upon her intervals of rest , 20</l>
     <l n="21">Dejected Clara well could bear</l>
     <l n="22">The formal state , the lengthen 'd prayer ,</l>

      <l n="25">I said , Tantallon 's dizzy steep 25</l>
      <l n="26">Hung o'er the margin of the deep .</l>
      <l n="27">Many a rude tower and rampart there</l>
      <l n="28">Repell 'd the insult of the air ,</l>
      <l n="29">Which , when the tempest vex 'd the sky ,</l>
      <l n="30">Half breeze , half spray , came whistling by . 30</l>
      <l n="31">Above the rest , a turret square</l>
      <l n="32">Did o'er its Gothic entrance bear ,</l>
      <l n="33">Of sculpture rude , a stony shield ;</l>
      <l n="34">The Bloody Heart was in the Field ,</l>
      <l n="35">And in the chief three mullets stood , 35</l>
      <l n="36">The cognizance of Douglas blood .</l>
      <l n="37">The turret held a narrow stair ,</l>
      <l n="38">Which , mounted , gave you access where</l>
      <l n="39">A parapet 's embattled row</l>
      <l n="40">Did seaward round the castle go . 40</l>
      <l n="41">Sometimes in dizzy steps descending ,</l>
      <l n="42">Sometimes in narrow circuit bending ,</l>
      <l n="43">Sometimes in platform broad extending ,</l>
      <l n="44">Its varying circle did combine</l>
      <l n="45">Bulwark , and bartisan , and line , 45</l>
      <l n="46">And bastion , tower , and vantage-coign :</l>
      <l n="47">Above the booming ocean leant</l>
      <l n="48">The far-projecting battlement ;</l>
      <l n="49">The billows burst , in ceaseless flow ,</l>
      <l n="50">Upon the precipice below . 50</l>
      <l n="51">Where'er Tantallon faced the land ,</l>
      <l n="52">Gate-works , and walls , were strongly mann 'd ;</l>
      <l n="53">No need upon the sea-girt side ;</l>
      <l n="54">The steepy rock , and frantic tide ,</l>
      <l n="55">Approach of human step denied ; 55</l>
      <l n="56">And thus these lines , and ramparts rude ,</l>
      <l n="57">Were left in deepest solitude .</l>

      <l n="58">And , for they were so lonely , Clare</l>
      <l n="59">Would to these battlements repair ,</l>
      <l n="60">And muse upon her sorrows there , 60</l>
      <l n="61">And list the sea-bird 's cry ;</l>
      <l n="62">Or slow , like noontide ghost , would glide</l>
      <l n="63">Along the dark-grey bulwarks ’ side ,</l>
      <l n="64">And ever on the heaving tide</l>
      <l n="65">Look down with weary eye . 65</l>
      <l n="66">Oft did the cliff , and swelling main ,</l>
      <l n="67">Recall the thoughts of Whitby 's fane ,—</l>
      <l n="68">A home she ne'er might see again ;</l>
      <l n="69">For she had laid adown ,</l>
      <l n="70">So Douglas bade , the hood and veil , 70</l>

      <l n="75">Now her bright locks , with sunny glow , 75</l>
      <l n="76">Again adorn 'd her brow of snow ;</l>
      <l n="77">Her mantle rich , whose borders , round ,</l>
      <l n="78">A deep and fretted broidery bound ,</l>
      <l n="79">In golden foldings sought the ground ;</l>
      <l n="80">Of holy ornament , alone 80</l>
      <l n="81">Remain 'd a cross with ruby stone ;</l>
      <l n="82">And often did she look</l>
      <l n="83">On that which in her hand she bore ,</l>
      <l n="84">With velvet bound , and broider 'd o'er ,</l>
      <l n="85">Her breviary book . 85</l>
      <l n="86">In such a place , so lone , so grim ,</l>
      <l n="87">At dawning pale , or twilight dim ,</l>
      <l n="88">It fearful would have been</l>
      <l n="89">To meet a form so richly dress 'd ,</l>
      <l n="90">With book in hand , and cross on breast , 90</l>
      <l n="91">And such a woeful mien .</l>

      <l n="93">To practise on the gull and crow ,</l>
      <l n="94">Saw her , at distance , gliding slow ,</l>
      <l n="95">And did by Mary swear ,— 95</l>
      <l n="96">Some love-lorn Fay she might have been ,</l>
      <l n="97">Or , in Romance , some spell-bound Queen ;</l>

      <l n="713">Short greeting serves in time of strife : -</l>
      <l n="714">Thus have I ranged my power :</l>
      <l n="715">Myself will rule this central host ,</l>
      <l n="716">Stout Stanley fronts their right , 715</l>
      <l n="717">My sons command the vaward post ,</l>

      <l n="761">Until at weapon-point they close .— 760</l>
      <l n="762">They close , in clouds of smoke and dust ,</l>
      <l n="763">With sword-sway , and with lance 's thrust ;</l>
      <l n="764">And such a yell was there ,</l>
      <l n="765">Of sudden and portentous birth ,</l>
      <l n="766">As if men fought upon the earth , 765</l>
      <l n="767">And fiends in upper air ;</l>

   <p>Thomas Bayne INTRODUCTION TO CANTO FIRST . With regard to the Introductions generally , Lockhart writes , in Life of Scott , ii . 150 :— ‘ Though the author himself does not allude to , and had perhaps forgotten the circumstance , when writing the Introductory Essay of 1830 — they were announced , by an advertisement early in 1807 , as “ Six Epistles from Ettrick Forest , ” to be published in a separate volume , similar to that of the Ballads and Lyrical Pieces ; and perhaps it might have been better that this first plan had been adhered to . But however that may be , are there any pages , among all he ever wrote , that one would be more sorry he should not have written ? They are among the most delicious portraitures that genius ever painted of itself — buoyant , virtuous , happy genius — exulting in its own energies , yet possessed and mastered by a clear , calm , modest mind , and happy only in diffusing happiness around it .</p>
   <p>‘ With what gratification those Epistles were read by the friends to whom they were addressed it is superfluous to show . He had , in fact , painted them almost as fully as himself ; and who might not have been proud to find a place in such a gallery ? The tastes and habits of six of those men , in whose intercourse Scott found the greatest pleasure when his fame was approaching its meridian splendour , are thus preserved for posterity ; and when I reflect with what avidity we catch at the least hint which seems to afford us a glimpse of the intimate circle of any great poet of former ages , I cannot but believe that posterity would have held this record precious , even had the individuals been in themselves far less remarkable than a Rose , an Ellis , a Heber , a Skene , a Marriott , and an Erskine . ’</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">William Stewart Rose ( 1775-1843 ) , to whom Scott addresses the</l>
     <l n="2">Introduction to Canto First , was a well-known man of letters in his</l>
     <l n="3">time . He addressed to Hallam , in 1819 , a work in two vols ., entitled</l>
     <l n="4">‘ Letters from the North of Italy , ’ and escaped a prohibitory order</l>
     <l n="5">from the Emperor of Austria by ingeniously changing his title to ‘ A</l>
     <l n="6">Treatise upon Sour Krout , ’ &amp; c. His other original works are ,</l>
     <l n="7">‘ Apology addressed to the Travellers ’ Club ; or , Anecdotes of</l>
     <l n="8">Monkeys ’ ; ‘ Thoughts and Recollections by one of the Last Century ’ ;</l>
     <l n="9">and ‘ Epistle to the Hon . J. Hookham Frere in Malta . ’ His</l>
     <l n="10">translations are these :— ‘ Amadis of Gaul : a Poem in three Books ,</l>
     <l n="11">freely translated from the French version of Nicholas de Herberay ’</l>
     <l n="12">( 1803 ) ; ‘ Partenopex de Blois , a Romance in four Cantos , from the</l>
     <l n="13">French of M. Le Grand ’ ( 1807 ) ; ‘ Court and Parliament of Beasts ,</l>
     <l n="14">translated from the Animali Parlanti of Giambatista Casti ’ ( 1819 ) ;</l>
     <l n="15">and ‘ Orlando Furioso , translated into English Verse ’ ( 1825-1831 ) .</l>
     <l n="16">The closing lines of this Introduction refer to Rose 's ‘ Amadis ’ and</l>
     <l n="17">‘ Partenopex . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Ashestiel , whence the Introduction to the First Canto is dated , is on the Tweed , about six miles above Abbotsford . ‘ The valley there is narrow , ’ says Lockhart , ‘ and the aspect in every direction is that of perfect pastoral repose . ’ This was Scott 's home from 1804 to l812 , when he removed to Abbotsford .</p>
   <p>lines 1-52 . This notable winter piece is the best modern contribution to that series of poetical descriptions by Scottish writers which includes Dunbar 's ‘ Meditatioun in Winter , ’ Gavin Douglas 's Scottish winter scene in the Prologue to his Virgil 's Aeneid VII , Hamilton of Bangour 's Ode III , and , of course , Thomson 's ‘ Winter ’ in ‘ The Seasons . ’ The details of the piece are given with admirable skill , and the local place-names are used with characteristic effect . The note of regret over winter 's ravages , common to all early Scottish poets , is skilfully struck and preserved , and thus the contrast designed between the wintry landscape and ‘ my Country 's wintry state ’ is rendered sharper and more decisive .</p>
   <p>line 3. steepy linn . Steepy is Elizabethan = steep , precipitous . Linn ( Gael . linne = pool ; A. S. hlinna = brook ) is variously used for ‘ pool under a waterfall , ’ ‘ cascade , ’ ‘ precipice , ’ and ‘ ravine . ’ The reference here is to the ravine close by Ashestiel , mentioned in Lockhart 's description of the surroundings :— ‘ On one side , close under the windows , is a deep ravine clothed with venerable trees , down which a mountain rivulet is heard , more than seen , in its progress to the Tweed . ’</p>
   <p>line 16. our forest hills . Selkirkshire is poetically called ‘ Ettrick Forest ’ ; hence the description of the soldiers from that district killed at Flodden as ‘ the flowers of the forest . ’</p>
   <p>line 22 . Cp . Hamilton of Bangour 's allusion ( Ode III . 43 ) to the appearance of winter on these heights ;—</p>

     <l n="2">He wanders on the tops of Yare ! ’</l>

The word means ( 1 ) a graft ; ( 2 ) a scion of a noble house ; ( 3 ) a little demon ; ( 4 ) a mischievous child . The context implies that the last is the sense in which the word is used here . Cp .

   <p>line 50. round . Strictly speaking , a round is a circular dance in which the performers hold each other by the hands . The term , however , is fairly applicable to the frolicsome gambols of a group of lambs in a spring meadow . Certain rounds became famous enough to be individualised , as e. g . Sellenger 's or St. Leger 's round , mentioned in the May-day song , ‘ Come Lasses and Lads . ’ Cp . Macbeth , iv . 1 ; Midsummer Night 's Dream , ii . 2 ; and see note on Comus , line 144 , in ‘ English Poems of Milton , ’ vol . i . ( Clarendon Press ) .</p>
   <p>line 53 . Lockhart , in a foot-note to his edition of ‘ Marmion , ’ quotes from the ‘ Monthly Review ’ of May , 1808 : ‘ The “ chance and change ” of nature — the vicissitudes which are observable in the moral as well as the physical part of the creation — have given occasion to more exquisite poetry than any other general subject .... The Ai , ai , tai Malaki of Moschus is worked up again to some advantage in the following passage — “ To mute , ” &amp; c . ’</p>
   <p>lines 61 , 62 . The inversion of reference in these lines is an illustration of the rhetorical figure ‘ chiasmus . ’ Cp . the arrangement of the demonstrative pronouns in these sentences from ‘ Kenilworth ':— ‘ Your eyes contradict your tongue . That speaks of a protector , willing and able to watch over you ; but these tell me you are ruined . ’</p>

   <p>lines 84-86 . Pitt ( 1759-1806 ) became First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1783 , and from 1785 onwards the facts of his career are a constituent part of national history . He faced with success difficulties like bread riots , mutinies in the fleet in 1797 , disturbances by the ‘ United Irishmen , ’ and the alarming threats of Napoleon . In 1800 the Union of Ireland with Great Britain gave Irishmen new motives for living , and in 1803 national patriotism , stirred and guided by Pitt , was manifested in the enrolment of over three hundred thousand volunteers prepared to withstand the vaunted ‘ Army of England . ’ In spite of his distinguished position and eminent services , Pitt died L40 , 000 in debt , and his responsibilities were promptly met by a vote of the House of Commons .</p>
   <p>lines 97-108 . These picturesque lines , with their varied and suggestive metaphors , were interpolated on the blank page of the MS . The reference in the expression ‘ tottering throne ’ in line 104 is to the threatened insanity of George III .</p>
   <p>lines 109-125 . Pitt 's patriotism was consistent and thorough . The anxious , troubled expression his face , betrayed in his latest appearances in the House of Commons , Wilberforce spoke of as ‘ his Austerlitz look , ’ and there seems little doubt that the burden of his public cares hastened his end . This gives point to the comparison of his fate with that of Aeneas 's pilot Palinurus ( Aeneid v. 833 ) .</p>
   <p>lines 127-141 . Charles James Fox ( 1749-1806 ) was second son of the first Lord Holland , whose indulgence tended to spoil a youth of unusual ability and precocity . Extravagant habits , contracted at an early age , were not easily thrown off afterwards , but they did not interfere with Fox 's efficiency as a statesman . His rivalry with Pitt dates from 1783 . Their tombs are near each other in Westminster Abbey .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>line 153 . Jeffrey , in his criticism of ‘ Marmion ’ in the ‘ Edinburgh Review , ’ found fault with the tribute to Fox , and cavilled in particular at the expression ‘ Fox a Briton died . ’ He argued that Scott praised only the action of Fox in breaking off the negotiations for peace with Napoleon , while insinuating that the previous part of his career was unpatriotic . Only a special pleader could put such an unworthy interpretation on the words .</p>
   <p>lines 155-65 . By the result of the battle of Austerlitz ( December , 1805 ) Napoleon seemed advancing towards general victory . Prussia hastily patched up a dishonourable peace on terms inconsistent with very binding pledges , and the Russian minister at Paris compromised his country by yielding to humiliating proposals on the part of France . All this changed Fox 's view of the position , and he broke off the negotiations for peace which had been begun in accordance with a policy he had long advocated .</p>
   <p>line 161 . There is a probable reference here to Nelson 's action at the battle of the Baltic . He disregarded the signal for cessation of fighting given by Sir Hyde Parker , and ordered his own signal to be nailed to the mast .</p>
   <p>line 176 . Thessaly was noted for witchcraft . The scene of Virgil 's eighth Eclogue is laid in Thessaly as appropriate to the introduction of such machinery as enchantments , love-spells , &amp; c. Cp . Horace , Epode v. 21 , and Ode I. xxvii . 21 :—</p>

     <l n="2">Magus venenis , quis poterit deus ? ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>In his ‘ Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft , ’ Letter III ., Scott , obviously basing his information on Horace , writes thus :— ‘ The classic mythology presented numerous points in which it readily coalesced with that of the Germans , Danes , and Northmen of a later period . They recognised the power of Erictho , Canidia , and other sorceresses , whose spells could perplex the course of the elements , intercept the influence of the sun , and prevent his beneficial operation upon the fruits of the earth ; call down the moon from her appointed sphere , and disturb the original and destined course of nature by their words and charms , and the power of the evil spirits whom they evoked . ’</p>
   <p>line 181 . Lees is properly pl . of lee ( Fr. lie = dregs ) , the sediment or coarser parts of a liquid which settle at the bottom , but it has come to be used as a collective word without reference to a singular form . For phrase , cp . Macbeth , ii . 3 . 96 :—</p>

By-and-by it came to be used variously for ‘ bier , ’ ‘ funeral carriage , ’ ornamental canopy with lighted candles over the coffins of notable people during the funeral ceremony , the permanent framework over a tomb , and even the tomb itself .

   <p>line 203 . The ‘ Border Minstrel ’ is an appropriate designation of the author of ‘ Contributions to the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border ’ and the ‘ Lay of the Last Minstrel . ’ In the preface to the latter work , written in 1830 , Scott refers to the two great statesmen as having ‘ smiled on the adventurous minstrel . ’ This is the only existing evidence of Fox 's appreciation . Pitt 's praise of the Lay his niece , Lady Hester Stanhope , reported to W. S. Rose , who very naturally passed it on to Scott himself . The Right Hon . William Dundas , in a letter to Scott , mentions a conversation he had had with Pitt at his table , in 1805 , and says that Pitt both expressed his desire to advance Scott 's professional interests and quoted from the Lay the lines describing the embarrassment of the harper when asked to play . ‘ This , ’ said he , ‘ is a sort of thing which I might have expected in painting , but could never have fancied capable of being given in poetry . ’ — Lockhart 's Life of Scott , ii . 34 .</p>
   <p>line 204 . Gothic . This refers to both subject and style , neither being classical .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>lines 233-48 . In these lines the poet indicates the sphere in which he had previously worked with independence and success . Like Virgil when proceeding to write the AEneid , he is doubtful whether his devotion to legendary and pastoral themes is sufficient warrant for attempting heroic verse . The reference to the tales of shepherds in the closing lines of the passage recalls the advice given ( about 1880 ) to his students by Prof. Shairp , when lecturing from the Poetry Chair at Oxford . ‘ To become steeped , ’ he said , ‘ in the true atmosphere of romantic poetry they should proceed to the Borders and learn their legends , under the twofold guidance of Scott 's “ Border Minstrelsy ” and an intelligent local shepherd . ’</p>
   <p>line 256. steely weeds = steel armour . ‘ Steely ’ in Elizabethan times was used both literally and figuratively . Shakespeare , 3 Henry VI . ii . 3 . 16 , has ‘ The steely point of Clifford 's lance , ’ and Fisher in his ‘ Seuen Psalmes ’ has ‘ tough and stely hertes . ’ For a modern literal example , see Crabbe 's ‘ Parish Register ':—</p>

   <p>WEEDS in the sense of dress is confined , in modern English , to widows ’ robes . In Elizabethan times it had a general reference , as e. g . Spenser 's ‘ lowly Shephards weeds ’ in the Introduction to ‘ Faery Queene . ’ Cp . below , Canto V. line 168 , VI . line 192 .</p>
   <p>line 258 . The Champion is Launcelot , the most famous of King Arthur 's Knights of the Round Table . See Tennyson 's ‘ Idylls of the King , ’ especially ‘ Lancelot and Elaine , ’ and William Morris 's ‘ Defence of Guenevere . ’</p>
   <p>line 263 . Dame Ganore is Guenevere , Arthur 's Queen .</p>
   <p>lines 258-262 . Scott annotates these lines as follows :—</p>
   <p>‘ The Romance of the Morte Arthur contains a sort of abridgment of the most celebrated adventures of the Round Table ; and , being written in comparatively modern language , gives the general reader an excellent idea of what romances of chivalry actually were . It has also the merit of being written in pure old English ; and many of the wild adventures which it contains are told with a simplicity bordering upon the sublime . Several of these are referred to in the text ; and I would have illustrated them by more full extracts , but as this curious work is about to be republished , I confine myself to the tale of the Chapel Perilous , and of the quest of Sir Launcelot after the Sangreal .</p>
   <p>‘ " Right so Sir Lanncelot departed , and when he came to the Chapell Perilous , he alighted downe , and tied his horse to a little gate . And as soon as he was within the churchyard , he saw , on the front of the chapell , many faire rich shields turned upside downe ; and many of the shields Sir Launcelot had seene knights have before ; with that he saw stand by him thirtie great knights , more , by a yard , than any man that ever he had seene , and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir Launcelot ; and when he saw their countenance , hee dread them sore , and so put his shield afore him , and tooke his sword in his hand ready to doe battaile ; and they were all armed in black harneis , ready , with their shields and swords drawen . And when Sir Launcelot would have gone through them , they scattered on every side of him , and gave him the way ; and therewith he waxed all bold , and entered into the chapell , and then hee saw no light but a dimme lampe burning , and then was he ware of a corps covered with a cloath of silke ; then Sir Launcelot stooped downe , and cut a piece of that cloath away , and then it fared under him as the earth had quaked a little , whereof he was afeard , and then hee saw a faire sword lye by the dead knight , and that he gat in his hand , and hied him out of the chappell . As soon as he was in the chappell-yerd , all the knights spoke to him with a grimly voice , and said , ‘ Knight , Sir Launcelot , lay that sword from thee , or else thou shalt die . ’ — ‘ Whether I live or die , ’ said Sir Launcelot , ‘ with no great words get yee it againe , therefore fight for it and ye list . ’ Therewith he passed through them ; and beyond the chappell-yerd , there met him a faire damosell , and said , ‘ Sir Launcelot , leave that sword behind thee , or thou wilt die for it . ’ — ‘ I will not leave it , ’ said Sir Launcelot , ‘ for no threats . ’ — ‘ No ? ’ said she ; ‘ and ye did leave that sword , Queen Guenever should ye never see . ’ — ‘ Then were I a foole and I would leave this sword , ’ said Sir Launcelot . ‘ Now , gentle knight , ’ said the damosell , ‘ I require thee to kisse me once . ’ — ‘ Nay , ’ said Sir Launcelot , ‘ that God forbid ! ’ — ‘ Well , sir , ’ said she , ‘ and thou hadest kissed me thy life dayes had been done ; but now , alas ! ’ said she , ‘ I have lost all my labour ; for I ordeined this chappell for thy sake , and for Sir Gawaine : and once I had Sir Gawaine within it ; and at that time he fought with that knight which there lieth dead in yonder chappell , Sir Gilbert the bastard , and at that time hee smote off Sir Gilbert the bastard 's left hand . And so , Sir Launcelot , now I tell thee , that I have loved thee this seaven yeare ; but there may no woman have thy love but Queene Guenever ; but sithen I may not rejoyice thee to have thy body alive , I had kept no more joy in this world but to have had thy dead body ; and I would have balmed it and served , and so have kept it in my life daies , and daily I should have clipped thee , and kissed thee , in the despite of Queen Guenever . ’ — ‘ Yee say well , ’ said Sir Launcelot ; ‘ Jesus preserve me from your subtill craft . ” And therewith he took his horse , and departed from her . " ’</p>
   <p>Sir Thomas Malory 's ‘ Morte D'Arthure ’ was first printed by Caxton in 4to ., 1485 . A new issue of this belongs to 1634 . The republication referred to by Scott is probably the edition published in 1816 , in two vols . l8mo . The Roxburghe Club made a sumptuous reprint in 1819 , and Thomas Wright , in 1858 , edited the work in three handy 8vo . vols . from the text of 1634 . This edition is furnished with a very useful introduction and notes .</p>
   <p>lines 267-70 . ‘ One day when Arthur was holding a high feast with his Knights of the Round Table , the Sangreal , or vessel out of which the last passover was eaten , ( a precious relic , which had long remained concealed from human eyes , because of the sins of the land ,) suddenly appeared to him and all his chivalry . The consequence of this vision was , that all the knights took on them a solemn vow to seek the Sangreal . But , alas ! it could only be revealed to a knight at once accomplished in earthly chivalry , and pure and guiltless of evil conversation . All Sir Launcelot 's noble accomplishments were therefore rendered vain by his guilty intrigue with Queen Guenever , or Ganore ; and in this holy quest he encountered only such disgraceful disasters as that which follows :—</p>
   <p>‘ But Sir Launcelot rode overthwart and endlong in a wild forest , and held no path , but as wild adventure led him ; and at the last , he came unto a stone crosse , which departed two wayes , in wast land ; and , by the crosse , was a stone that was of marble ; but it was so dark , that Sir Launcelot might not well know what it was . Then Sir Launcelot looked by him , and saw an old chappell , and there he wend to have found people . And so Sir Launcelot tied his horse to a tree , and there he put off his shield , and hung it upon a tree , and then hee went unto the chappell doore , and found it wasted and broken . And within he found a faire altar , full richly arrayed with cloth of silk , and there stood a faire candlestick , which beare six great candles , and the candlesticke was of silver . And when Sir Launcelot saw this light , hee had a great will for to enter into the chappell , but he could find no place where hee might enter . Then was he passing heavie and dismaied . Then he returned , and came again to his horse , and tooke off his saddle and his bridle , and let him pasture , and unlaced his helme , and ungirded his sword , and laid him downe to sleepe upon his shield , before the crosse .</p>
   <p>‘ And so hee fell on sleepe ; and , halfe waking and halfe sleeping , hee saw come by him two palfreys , both faire and white , the which beare a litter , therein lying a sicke knight . And when he was nigh the crosse , he there abode still . All this Sir Launcelot saw and beheld , for hee slept not verily , and hee heard him say , “ O sweete Lord , when shall this sorrow leave me , and when shall the holy vessell come by me , where through I shall be blessed , for I have endured thus long for little trespasse ! ” And thus a great while complained the knight , and allwaies Sir Launcelot heard it . With that Sir Launcelot saw the candlesticke , with the fire tapers , come before the crosse ; but he could see no body that brought it . Also there came a table of silver , and the holy vessel of the Sancgreall , the which Sir Launcelot had seen before that time in King Petchour 's house . And therewithall the sicke knight set him upright , and held up both his hands , and said , “ Faire sweete Lord , which is here within the holy vessell , take heed to mee , that I may bee hole of this great malady ! ” And therewith upon his hands , and upon his knees , he went so nigh , that he touched the holy vessell , and kissed it : And anon he was hole , and then he said , “ Lord God , I thank thee , for I am healed of this malady . ” Soo when the holy vessell had been there a great while , it went into the chappell againe , with the candlesticke and the light , so that Sir Launcelot wist not where it became , for he was overtaken with sinne , that he had no power to arise against the holy vessell , wherefore afterward many men said of him shame . But he tooke repentance afterward . Then the sicke knight dressed him upright , and kissed the crosse . Then anon his squire brought him his armes , and asked his lord how he did . “ Certainly , ” said hee , I thanke God right heartily , for through the holy vessell I am healed : But I have right great mervaile of this sleeping knight , which hath had neither grace nor power to awake during the time that this holy vessell hath beene here present . ” — “ I dare it right well say , ” said the squire , “ that this same knight is defouled with some manner of deadly sinne , whereof he has never confessed . ” — “ By my faith , ” said the knight , “ whatsoeer he be , he is unhappie ; for , as I deeme , hee is of the fellowship of the Round Table , the which is entered into the quest of the Sancgreall . ” — “ Sir , ” said the squire , “ here I have brought you all your armes , save your helme and your sword ; and , therefore , by mine assent , now may ye take this knight 's helme and his sword ; ’ and so he did . And when he was cleane armed , he took Sir Launcelot 's horse , for he was better than his owne , and so they departed from the crosse .</p>
   <p>‘ Then anon Sir Launcelot awaked , and set himselfe upright , and he thought him what hee had there seene , and whether it were dreames or not ; right so he heard a voice that said , “ Sir Launcelot , more hardy than is the stone , and more bitter than is the wood , and more naked and bare than is the liefe of the fig-tree , therefore go thou from hence , and withdraw thee from this holy place ; ” and when Sir Launcelot heard this , he was passing heavy , and wist not what to doe . And so he departed sore weeping , and cursed the time that he was borne ; for then he deemed never to have had more worship ; for the words went unto his heart , till that he knew wherefore that hee was so called . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 273 . Arthur is the hero of the ‘ Faery Queene . ’ In his explanatory letter to Sir Walter Raleigh , Spenser says , ‘ I chose the historye of King Arthure , as most fitte for the excellency of his person , being made famous by many mens former workes , and also furthest from the daunger of envy , and suspicion of present time . ’</p>
   <p>line 274 . Milton is said to have meditated in his youth the composition of an epic poem on Arthur and the Round Table . In ‘ Paradise Lost ’ ix . 26 , he states that the subject of that poem pleased him ‘ long choosing and beginning late , ’ and references both in ‘ Paradise Lost ’ and ‘ Paradise Regained ’ prove his familiarity with the Arthurian legend . Cp . Par . Lost , i . 580 , and Par . Reg . ii . 358 .</p>
   <p>line 275 . Scott quotes from Dryden 's ‘ Essay on Satire , ’ prefixed to the translation of Juvenal , regarding his projected Epic . ‘ Of two subjects , ’ says Dryden , ‘ I was doubtful whether I should choose that of King Arthur conquering the Saxons , which , being further distant in time , gives the greater scope to my invention ; or that of Edward the Black Prince , in subduing Spain , and restoring it to the lawful prince , though a great tyrant , Pedro the Cruel .... I might perhaps have done as well as some of my predecessors , or at least chalked out a way for others to amend my errors in a like design ; but being encouraged only with fair words by King Charles II , my little salary ill paid , and no prospect of a future subsistence , I was then discouraged in the beginning of my attempt ; and now age has overtaken me , and want , a more insufferable evil , through the change of the times , has wholly disabled me . ’</p>
   <p>lines 281-3 . Dryden 's dramas , certain of his translations , and various minor pieces adapted to the prevalent taste of his time , are unworthy of his genius . Pope 's reflections on the poet forgetful of the dignity of his office , with the allusion to Dryden as an illustration ( ‘ Satires and Epistles , ’ v. 209 ) , may be compared with this passage ;—</p>

   <p>line 286 . To break a lance is to enter the lists , to try one 's strength . The concussion of two powerful knights would suffice to shiver the lances . Hence comes the figurative use . Cp . I Henry VI . iii . 2 ,—</p>

   <p>lines 288-309 . The Genius of Chivalry is to be resuscitated from the deep slumber under which baneful spells have long effectually held him . The appropriateness of this is apparent when the true meaning of Chivalry is considered . Scott opens his ‘ Essay on Chivalry ’ thus :— ‘ The primitive sense of this well-known word , derived from the French Chevalier , signifies merely cavalry , or a body of soldiers serving on horseback ; and it has been used in that general acceptation by the best of our poets , ancient and modern , from Milton to Thomas Campbell . ’ See Par . Lost , i . 307 , and Battle of Hohenlinden .</p>
   <p>line 294 . To spur forward his horse on an expedition of adventures , like Spenser 's Red Cross Knight . For the accoutrements and the duties of a knight see Scott 's ‘ Essay on Chivalry ’ ( Miscellaneous Works , vol . vi . ) .

   <p>CANTO FIRST . The Introduction is written on a basis of regular four-beat couplets , each line being technically an iambic tetrameter ; lines 96 , 205 , and 283 are Alexandrines , or iambic hexameters , each serving to give emphasis and resonance ( like the ninth of the Spenserian stanza ) to the passage which it closes . Intensity of expression is given by the triplet which closes the passage ending with line 125 . The metrical basis of the movement in the Canto is likewise iambic tetrameter , but the trimeter or three-beat line is freely introduced , and the poet allows himself great scope in his arrangement .</p>
   <p>Stanza I. line 1 . ‘ The ruinous castle of Norham ( anciently called Ubbanford ) is situated on the southern bank of the Tweed , about six miles above Berwick , and where that river is still the boundary between England and Scotland . The extent of its ruins , as well as its historical importance , shows it to have been a place of magnificence , as well as strength . Edward I resided there when he was created umpire of the dispute concerning the Scottish succession . It was repeatedly taken and retaken during the wars between England and Scotland ; and , indeed , scarce any happened , in which it had not a principal share . Norham Castle is situated on a steep bank , which overhangs the river . The repeated sieges which the castle had sustained , rendered frequent repairs necessary . In 1164 , it was almost rebuilt by Hugh Pudsey , Bishop of Durham , who added a huge keep , or donjon ; notwithstanding which , King Henry II , in 1174 , took the castle from the bishop , and committed the keeping of it to William de Neville . After this period it seems to have been chiefly garrisoned by the King , and considered as a royal fortress . The Greys of Chillinghame Castle were frequently the castellans , or captains of the garrison : Yet , as the castle was situated in the patrimony of St. Cuthbert , the property was in the see of Durham till the Reformation . After that period , it passed through various hands . At the union of the crowns , it was in the possession of Sir Robert Carey , ( afterwards Earl of Monmouth ,) for his own life , and that of two of his sons . After King James 's accession , Carey sold Norham Castle to George Home , Earl of Dunbar , for L6000 . See his curious Memoirs , published by Mr. Constable of Edinburgh .</p>
   <p>‘ According to Mr. Pinkerton , there is , in the British Museum . Cal . B . 6 . 216 , a curious memoir of the Dacres on the state of Norham Castle in 1522 , not long after the battle of Flodden . The inner ward , or keep , is represented as impregnable :— “ The provisions are three great vats of salt eels , forty-four kine , three hogsheads of salted salmon , forty quarters of grain , besides many cows and four hundred sheep , lying under the castle-wall nightly ; but a number of the arrows wanted feathers , and a good Fletcher [ i. e . maker of arrows ] was required . ” — History of Scotland , vol . ii . p. 201 , note .</p>
   <p>‘ The ruins of the castle are at present considerable , as well as picturesque . They consist of a large shattered tower , with many vaults , and fragments of other edifices , enclosed within an outward wall of great circuit . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>the donjon keep . ‘ It is perhaps unnecessary to remind my readers , that the donjon , in its proper signification , means the strongest part of a feudal castle ; a high square tower , with walls of tremendous thickness , situated in the centre of the other buildings , from which , however , it was usually detached . Here , in case of the outward defences being gained , the garrison retreated to make their last stand . The donjon contained the great hall , and principal rooms of state for solemn occasions , and also the prison of the fortress ; from which last circumstance we derive the modern and restricted use of the word dungeon . Ducange ( voce DUNJO ) conjectures plausibly , that the name is derived from these keeps being usually built upon a hill , which in Celtic is called DUN . Borlase supposes the word came from the darkness of the apartments in these towers , which were thence figuratively called Dungeons ; thus deriving the ancient word from the modern application of it . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>Stanzas V and VI . Marmion , strenuous in arms and prudent in counsel , has a kinship in spirit and achievement with the Homeric heroes . Compare him also with the typical knight in Chaucer 's Prologue and the Red Cross Knight at the opening of the ‘ Faerie Queene . ’ Scott annotates ‘ Milan steel ’ and the legend thus :—</p>
   <p>‘ The artists of Milan were famous in the middle ages for their skill in armoury , as appears from the following passage , in which Froissart gives an account of the preparations made by Henry , Earl of Hereford , afterwards Henry IV , and Thomas , Duke of Norfolk , Earl Marischal , for their proposed combat in the lists at Coventry :— “ These two lords made ample provisions of all things necessary for the combat ; and the Earl of Derby sent off messengers to Lombardy , to have armour from Sir Galeas , Duke of Milan . The Duke complied with joy , and gave the knight , called Sir Francis , who had brought the message , the choice of all his armour for the Earl of Derby . When he had selected what he wished for in plated and mail armour , the Lord of Milan , out of his abundant love for the Earl , ordered four of the best armourers in Milan to accompany the knight to England , that the Earl of Derby might be more completely armed . ” — JOHNES ’ Froissart , vol . iv . p. 597 .</p>
   <p>‘ The crest and motto of Marmion are borrowed from the following story :—</p>
   <p>Sir David de Lindsay , first Earl of Cranford , was , among other gentlemen of quality , attended , during a visit to London in 1390 , by Sir William Dalzell , who was , according to my authority , Bower , not only excelling in wisdom , but also of a lively wit . Chancing to be at the Court , he there saw Sir Piers Conrtenay , an English knight , famous for skill in tilting , and for the beauty of his person , parading the palace , arrayed in a new mantle , bearing for device an embroidered falcon , with this rhyme ,—</p>
   <lg>
    <lg type="stanza" n="1">
     <l n="1">“ I bear a falcon , fairest of night ,</l>

   <p>‘ The Scottish knight , being a wag , appeared next day in a dress exactly similar to that of Courtenay , but bearing a magpie instead of the falcon , with a motto ingeniously contrived to rhyme to the vaunting inscription of Sir Piers :—</p>

     <l n="1">“ I bear a pie picking at a piece ,</l>

   <p>‘ This affront could only be expiated by a just with sharp lances . In the course , Dalzell left his helmet unlaced , so that it gave way at the touch of his antagonist 's lance , and he thus avoided the shock of the encounter . This happened twice :— in the third encounter , the handsome Courtenay lost two of his front teeth . As the Englishman complained bitterly of Dalzell 's fraud in not fastening his helmet , the Scottishman agreed to run six courses more , each champion staking in the hand of the King two hundred pounds , to be forfeited , if , on entering the lists , any unequal advantage should be detected . This being agreed to , the wily Scot demanded that Sir Piers , in addition to the loss of his teeth , should consent to the extinction of one of his eyes , he himself having lost an eye in the fight of Otterburn . As Courtenay demurred to this equalisation of optical powers , Dalzell demanded the forfeit ; which , after much altercation , the King appointed to be paid to him , saying , he surpassed the English both in wit and valour . This must appear to the reader a singular specimen of the humour of that time . I suspect the Jockey Club would have given a different decision from Henry IV . ’</p>

   <p>line 156 . ‘ Lord Marmion , the principal character of the present romance , is entirely a fictitious personage . In earlier times , indeed , the family of Marmion , Lords of Fontenay , in Normandy , was highly distinguished . Robert de Marmion , Lord of Fontenay , a distinguished follower of the Conqueror , obtained a grant of the castle and town of Tamworth , and also of the manor of Scrivelby , in Lincolnshire . One , or both , of these noble possessions was held by the honourable service of being the royal champion , as the ancestors of Marmion had formerly been to the Dukes of Normandy . But after the castle and demesne of Tamworth had passed through four successive barons from Robert , the family became extinct in the person of Philip de Marmion , who died in 20th Edward I without issue male . He was succeeded in his castle of Tamworth by Alexander de Freville , who married Mazera , his grand-daughter . Baldwin de Freville , Alexander 's descendant , in the reign of Richard I , by the supposed tenure of his castle of Tamworth , claimed the office of royal champion , and to do the service appertaining ; namely , on the day of coronation , to ride , completely armed , upon a barbed horse , into Westminster Hall , and there to challenge the combat against any who would gainsay the King 's title . But this office was adjudged to Sir John Dymoke , to whom the manor of Scrivelby had descended by another of the co-heiresses of Robert de Marmion ; and it remains in that family , whose representative is Hereditary Champion of England at the present day . The family and possessions of Freville have merged in the Earls of Ferrars . I have not , therefore , created a new family , but only revived the titles of an old one in an imaginary personage . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

Scott writes :— ‘ Were accuracy of any consequence in a fictitious narrative , this castellan 's name ought to have been William ; for William Heron of Ford was husband to the famous Lady Ford , whose syren charms are said to have cost our James IV so dear . Moreover , the said William Heron was , at the time supposed , a prisoner in Scotland , being surrendered by Henry VIII , on account of his share in the slaughter of Sir Robert Ker of Cessford . His wife , represented in the text as residing at the Court of Scotland , was , in fact , living in her own castle at Ford .— See Sir RICHARD HERON 'S curious Genealogy of the Heron Family . ’</p>
   <p>Ford Castle is about a mile to the north-east of Flodden Hill . It was repaired in 1761 in accordance with the style of the original architecture .

   <p>Stanza XIX . line 305 . ‘ The garrisons of the English castles of Wark , Norham , and Berwick were , as may be easily supposed , very troublesome neighbours to Scotland . Sir Richard Maitland of Ledington wrote a poem , called “ The Blind Baron 's Comfort , ” when his barony of Blythe , in Lauderdale , was HARRIED by Rowland Foster , the English captain of Wark , with his company , to the number of 300 men . They spoiled the poetical knight of 5000 sheep , 200 nolt , 30 horses and mares ; the whole furniture of his house of Blythe , worth 100 pounds Scots ( L8 . 6s . 8d . ) , and every thing else that was portable . “ This spoil was committed the 16th day of May , 1570 , ( and the said Sir Richard was threescore and fourteen years of age , and grown blind ,) in time of peace ; when nane of that country LIPPENED [ expected ] such a thing . ” — “ The Blind Baron 's Comfort ” consists in a string of puns on the word BLYTHE , the name of the lands thus despoiled . Like John Littlewit , he had “ a conceit left him in his misery — a miserable conceit . ”</p>
   <p>‘ The last line of the text contains a phrase , by which the Borderers jocularly intimated the burning a house . When the Maxwells , in 1685 , burned the castle of Lochwood , they said they did so to give the Lady Johnstone “ light to set her hood . ” Nor was the phrase inapplicable ; for , in a letter , to which I have mislaid the reference , the Earl of Northumberland writes to the King and Council , that he dressed himself at midnight , at Warkworth , by the blaze of the neighbouring villages burned by the Scottish marauders . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>‘ " This man , ” says Holinshed , “ had many good things in him . He was of no great stature , but well set , and mightilie compact . He was a very good wrestler ; shot well , both in the long-bow , and also in the cross-bow ; he handled his hand-gun and peece very well ; he was a very good woodman , and a hardie , and such a one as would not give his head for the polling , or his beard for the washing . He was a companion in any exercise of activitie , and of a courteous and gentle behaviour . He descended of a good honest parentage , being borne at Peneverin , in Cornwall ; and yet , in this rebellion , an arch-captain , and a principal doer . ” — Vol . iv . p. 958 , 4to edition .

   <p>‘ Sante Rosalie was of Palermo , and born of a very noble family , and , when very young , abhorred so much the vanities of this world , and avoided the converse of mankind , resolving to dedicate herself wholly to God Almighty , that she , by divine inspiration , forsook her father 's house , and never was more heard of , till her body was found in that cleft of a rock , on that almost inaccessible mountain , where now the chapel is built ; and they affirm she was carried up there by the hands of angels ; for that place was not formerly so accessible ( as now it is ) in the days of the Saint ; and even now it is a very bad , and steepy , and break-neck way . In this frightful place , this holy woman lived a great many years , feeding only on what she found growing on that barren mountain , and creeping into a narrow and dreadful cleft in a rock , which was always dropping wet , and was her place of retirement , as well as prayer ; having worn out even the rock with her knees , in a certain place , which is now open 'd on purpose to show it to those who come here . This chapel is very richly adorn 'd ; and on the spot where the saint 's dead body was discover 'd , which is just beneath the hole in the rock , which is open 'd on purpose , as I said , there is a very fine statue of marble , representing her in a lying posture , railed in all about with fine iron and brass work ; and the altar , on which they say mass , is built just over it . ’ — Voyage to Sicily and Malta , by Mr. John Dryden , ( son to the poet ,) p. 107 .</p>

   <p>Stanza XXIX . line 506 . ‘ St. Regulus ( Scottice , St. Rule ) , a monk of Patrae , in Achaia , warned by a vision , is said , A. D. 370 , to have sailed westward , until he landed at St. Andrews , in Scotland , where he founded a chapel and tower . The latter is still standing ; and , though we may doubt the precise date of its foundation , is certainly one of the most ancient edifices in Scotland . A cave , nearly fronting the ruinous castle of the Archbishops of St. Andrews , bears the name of this religion person . It is difficult of access ; and the rock in which it is hewed is washed by the German Ocean . It is nearly round , about ten feet in diameter , and the same in height . On one side is a sort of stone altar ; on the other an aperture into an inner den , where the miserable ascetic , who inhabited this dwelling , probably slept . At full tide , egress and regress are hardly practicable . As Regulus first colonised the metropolitan see of Scotland , and converted the inhabitants in the vicinity , he has some reason to complain that the ancient name of Killrule ( Cella Reguli ) should have been superseded , even in favour of the tutelar saint of Scotland . The reason of the change was , that St. Rule is said to have brought to Scotland the relics of Saint Andrew . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

Although Popery is , with us , matter of abomination , yet the common people still retain some of the superstitions connected with it .

They are held powerful in cases of madness ; and , in some of very late occurrence , lunatics have been left all night bound to the holy stone , in confidence that the saint would cure and unloose them before morning .

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO SECOND .</p>
   <p>The Rev . John Marriott , A. M ., to whom this introductory poem is dedicated , was tutor to George Henry , Lord Scott , son of Charles , Earl of Dalkeith , afterwards fourth Duke of Buccleuch and sixth of Queensberry . Lord Scott died early , in 1808 . Marriott , while still at Oxford , proved himself a capable poet , and Scott shewed his appreciation of him by including two of his ballads at the close of the ‘ Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border . ’ The concluding lines of this Introduction refer to Marriott 's ballads .</p>
   <p>line 2 . ‘ Ettrick Forest , now a range of mountainous sheep-walks , was anciently reserved for the pleasure of the royal chase . Since it was disparked , the wood has been , by degrees , almost totally destroyed , although , wherever protected from the sheep , copses soon arise without any planting . When the King hunted there , he often summoned the array of the country to meet and assist his sport . Thus , in 1528 , James V “ made proclamation to all lords , barons , gentlemen , landward-men , and freeholders , that they should compear at Edinburgh , with a month 's victuals , to pass with the King where he pleased , to danton the thieves of Tiviotdale , Annandale , Liddisdale , and other parts of that country ; and also warned all gentlemen that had good dogs to bring them , that he might hunt in the said country as he pleased : The whilk the Earl of Argyle , the Earl of Huntley , the Earl of Athole , and so all the rest of the gentlemen of the Highland , did , and brought their hounds with them in like manner , to hunt with the King , as he pleased .</p>
   <p>‘ " The second day of June the King past out of Edinburgh to the hunting , with many of the nobles and gentlemen of Scotland with him , to the number of twelve thousand men ; and then past to Meggitland , and hounded and hawked all the country and bounds ; that is to say , Crammat , Pappert-law , St. Mary-laws , Carlavirick , Chapel , Ewindoores , and Langhope . I heard say , he slew , in these bounds , eighteen score of harts . ” -PITSCOTTIE 'S History of Scotland , folio edition , p. 143 .</p>
   <p>‘ These huntings had , of course , a military character , and attendance upon them was part of the duty of a vassal . The act for abolishing ward or military tenures in Scotland , enumerates the services of hunting , hosting , watching and warding , as those which were in future to be illegal . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>lines 5-11 . Cp . Wordsworth 's ‘ Thorn ':—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ There is a Thorn — it looks so old ,</l>
     <l n="2">In truth , you 'd find it hard to say</l>
     <l n="3">How it could ever have been young ,</l>
     <l n="4">It looks so old and grey . ’</l>
   </lg>
   <p>There is a special suggestion of antiquity in the wrinkled , lichen - covered thorn of a wintry landscape , and thus it is a fitting object to stir and sustain the poet 's tendency to note ‘ chance and change ’ and to lament the loss of the days that are no more . The exceeding appropriateness of this in a narrative poem dealing with departed habits and customs must be quite apparent . The thorn grows to a very great age , and many an unpretentious Scottish homestead receives a pathetic grace and dignity from the presence of its ancestral thorn - tree .</p>
   <p>line 15 . The rowan is the mountain ash . One of the most tender and haunting of Scottish songs is Lady Nairne 's ‘ Oh , Rowan tree ! ’ —</p>

   <p>line 27 . There are some notable allusions in the poets to the moonlight baying of dogs and wolves . Cp . Julius Caesar , iv . 3 . 27 :—</p>

It is connected with a smaller lake , called the Loch of the Lowes , and surrounded by mountains . In the winter , it is still frequented by flights of wild swans ; hence my friend Mr. Wordsworth 's lines :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The swan on sweet St. Mary 's lake</l>
     <l n="2">Floats double , swan and shadow . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>Near the lower extremity of the lake are the ruins of Dryhope tower , the birth-place of Mary Scott , daughter of Philip Scott of Dryhope , and famous by the traditional name of the Flower of Yarrow . She was married to Walter Scott of Harden , no less renowned for his depredations than his bride for her beauty . Her romantic appellation was , in latter days , with equal justice , conferred on Miss Mary Lilias Scott , the last of the elder branch of the Harden family . The author well remembers the talent and spirit of the latter Flower of Yarrow , though age had then injured the charms which procured her the name . The words usually sung to the air of “ Tweedside , ” beginning “ What beauties does Flora disclose , ” were composed in her honour . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>Quoting from memory , Scott gives ‘ sweet ’ for STILL in Wordsworth 's lines . Mr. Aubrey de Vere , in ‘ Essays Chiefly on Poetry , ’ ii . 277 , reports an interview with Wordsworth , in which the poet , referring to St. Mary 's Lake , says : ‘ The scene when I saw it , with its still and dim lake , under the dusky hills , was one of utter loneliness ; there was one swan , and one only , stemming the water , and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to the one companion of that swan — its own white image in the water . ’ For a criticism , deeply sympathetic and appreciative , of Scott 's description of St. Mary 's Loch in calm , see Prof. Veitch 's ‘ Feeling for Nature in Scottish Poetry , ’ ii . 196 . The scene remains very much what it was in Scott 's time , ‘ notwithstanding that the hand of the Philistine , ’ says Prof. Veitch , ‘ has set along the north shore of St. Mary 's , as far as his power extended , a strip of planting . ’</p>
   <p>line 177 . ‘ The chapel of St. Mary of the Lowes { de lacubus } was situated on the eastern side of the lake , to which it gives name . It was injured by the clan of Scott , in a feud with the Cranstouns ; but continued to be a place of worship during the seventeenth century . The vestiges of the building can now scarcely be traced ; but the burial-ground is still used as a cemetery . A funeral , in a spot so very retired , has an uncommonly striking effect . The vestiges of the chaplain 's house are yet visible . Being in a high situation , it commanded a full view of the lake , with the opposite mountain of Bourhope , belonging , with the lake itself , to Lord Napier . On the left hand is the tower of Dryhope , mentioned in a preceding note . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>line 204 . ‘ At one corner of the burial-ground of the demolished chapel , but without its precincts , is a small mound , called Binrams Corse , where tradition deposits the remains of a necromantic priest , the former tenant of the chaplainry . His story much resembles that of Ambrosio in “ The Monk , ” and has been made the theme of a ballad by my friend Mr. James Hogg , more poetically designed the Ettrick Shepherd . To his volume , entitled “ The Mountain Bard , ” which contains this , and many other legendary stories and ballads of great merit , I refer the curious reader . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 239 . ‘ Loch-skene is a mountain lake , of considerable size , at the head of the Moffat-water . The character of the scenery is uncommonly savage ; and the earn , or Scottish eagle , has , for many ages , built its nest yearly upon an islet in the lake . Loch-skene discharges itself into a brook , which , after a short and precipitate course , falls from a cataract of immense height and gloomy grandeur , called , from its appearance , the “ Grey Mare 's Tail . ” The “ Giant 's Grave , ” afterwards mentioned , is a sort of trench , which bears that name , a little way from the foot of the cataract . It has the appearance of a battery designed to command the pass . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>lines 1-6 . The earlier editions have a period at the end of line 5 , and neither Scott himself nor Lockhart changed that punctuation .

   <p>line 9 . ‘ The Abbey of Whitby , in the Archdeaconry of Cleaveland , on the coast of Yorkshire , was founded A. D. 657 , in consequence of a vow of Oswy , King of Northumberland . It contained both monks and nuns of the Benedictine order ; but , contrary to what was usual in such establishments , the abbess was superior to the abbot . The monastery was afterwards mined by the Danes , and rebuilded by William Percy , in the reign of the Conqueror . There were no nuns there in Henry the Eighth 's time , nor long before it . The ruins of Whitby Abbey are very magnificent . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 10 . ‘ Lindisfarne , an isle on the coast of Northumberland , was called Holy Island , from the sanctity of its ancient monastery , and from its having been the episcopal seat of the see of Durham during the early ages of British Christianity . A succession of holy men held that office : but their merits were swallowed up in the superior fame of St. Cuthbert , who was sixth bishop of Durham , and who bestowed the name of his “ patrimony ” upon the extensive property of the see . The ruins of the monastery upon Holy Island betoken great antiquity . The arches are , in general , strictly Saxon , and the pillars which support them , short , strong , and massy . In some places , however , there are pointed windows , which indicate that the building has been repaired at a period long subsequent to the original foundation . The exterior ornaments of the building , being of a light sandy stone , have been wasted , as described in the text . Lindisfarne is not properly an island , but rather , as the Venerable Bede has termed it , a semi-isle ; for , although surrounded by the sea at full tide , the ebb leaves the sands dry between it and the opposite coast of Northumberland , from which it is about three miles distant . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>The monastery , of which the present ruins remain , was built , between 1093 and 1120 , by Benedictine monks under the direction of William Carileph , Bishop of Durham . There were sixteen bishops in Holy Island between St. Aidan ( 635 A. D .) and Eardulph ( 875 A. D .) . The Christians were dispersed after the violent inroad of the Danes in 868 , and for two centuries Lindisfarne suffered apparent relapse . Lindisfarne ( Gael . farne , a retreat ) signifies ‘ a place of retreat by the brook Lindis . ’ The name Holy Island was given by Carileph 's monks , to commemorate , they said , ‘ the sacred blood which had been shed by the Danes . ’ See Raine 's ‘ History of North Durham , ’ F. R. Wilson 's ‘ Churches of Lindisfarne , ’ and Mr. Keeling 's ‘ Lindisfarne , or Holy Island : its History and Associations . ’</p>

   <p>Stanza XIII . line 234 . Scott quotes from ‘ A True Account , ’ circulated at Whitby , concerning the consequences of a boar-hunt on Eskdale-side , belonging to the Abbot of Whitby . The boar , being hard pressed , made for a hermitage and died just within the door . Coming up , the three leaders — William de Bruce , Lord of Uglebarnby , Ralph de Percy , Lord of Smeaton , and a freeholder named Allatson — in their disappointment and wrath set upon the hermit , whom they fatally wounded . When the abbot afterwards came to the dying hermit , and told him his assailants would suffer extreme penalty for their ruthless conduct , the hermit asked the gentlemen to be sent for , and said he would pardon them on certain conditions . ‘ The gentlemen being present bade him save their lives .— Then said the hermit , “ You and yours shall hold your lands of the Abbot of Whitby , and his successors , in this manner : That , upon Ascension-day , you , or some of you , shall come to the wood of the Stray-heads , which is in Eskdale-side , the same day at sun-rising , and there shall the abbot 's officer blow his horn , to the intent that you may know where to find him ; and he shall deliver unto you , William de Bruce , ten stakes , eleven strout stowers , and eleven yethers , to be cut by you , or some of you , with a knife of one penny price : and you , Ralph de Percy , shall take twenty-one of each sort , to be cut in the same manner ; and you , Allatson , shall take nine of each sort , to be cut as aforesaid , and to be taken on your backs and carried to the town of Whitby , and to be there before nine of the clock the same day before mentioned . At the same hour of nine of the clock , if it be full sea , your labour and service shall cease ; and if low water , each of you shall set your stakes to the brim , each stake one yard from the other , and so yether them on each side with your yethers ; and so stake on each side with your strout stowers , that they may stand three tides , without removing by the force thereof . Each of you shall do , make , and execute the said service , at that very hour , every year , except it be fall sea at that hour ; but when it shall so fall out , this service shall cease . You shall faithfully do this , in remembrance that you did most cruelly slay me ; and that you may the better call to God for mercy , repent unfeignedly of your sins , and do good works . The officer of Eskdale-side shall blow , Out on you ! Out on you ! Out on you ! for this heinous crime . If you , or your successors , shall refuse this service , so long as it shall not be full sea at the aforesaid hour , you or yours shall forfeit your lands to the Abbot of Whitby , or his successors . This I entreat , and earnestly beg , that you may have lives and goods preserved for this service : and I request of you to promise , by your parts in Heaven , that it shall be done by you and your successors , as is aforesaid requested ; and I will confirm it by the faith of an honest man . ” — Then the hermit said , “ My soul longeth for the Lord : and I do as freely forgive these men my death , as Christ forgave the thieves on the cross . ” And , in the presence of the abbot and the rest , he said moreover these words : “ In manus tuos , Domine , commendo spiritum meum , a vinculis enim mortis redemisti me , Domine veritatis , Amen . ” - - So he yielded up the ghost the eighth day of December , anno Domini 1159 , whose soul God have mercy upon . Amen .</p>
   <p>‘ " This service , ” it is added , “ still continues to be performed with the prescribed ceremonies , though not by the proprietors in person . Part of the lands charged therewith are now held by a gentleman of the name of Herbert . " ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 244 . Edelfled ‘ was the daughter of King Oswy , who , in gratitude to Heaven for the great victory which he won in 655 , against Penda , the pagan King of Mercia , dedicated Edelfleda , then but a year old , to the service of God , in the monastery of Whitby , of which St. Hilda was then abbess . She afterwards adorned the place of her education with great magnificence . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 251 . ‘ These two miracles are much insisted on by all ancient writers who have occasion to mention either Whitby or St. Hilda . The relics of the snakes , which infested the precincts of the convent , and were at the abbess 's prayer not only beheaded but petrified , are still found about the rocks , and are termed by Protestant fossilists , Ammonitae .</p>
   <p>‘ The other miracle is thus mentioned by Camden : “ It is also ascribed to the power of her sanctity , that these wild geese , which , in the winter , fly in great flocks to the lakes and rivers unfrozen in the southern parts , to the great amazement of every one , fall down suddenly upon the ground , when they are in their flight over certain ‘ neighbouring fields hereabouts : a relation I should not have made , if I had not received it from several credible men . But those who are less inclined to heed superstition , attribute it to some occult quality in the ground , and to somewhat of antipathy between it and the geese , such as they say is betwixt wolves and scyllaroots : for that such hidden tendencies and aversions , as we call sympathies and antipathies , are implanted in many things by provident Nature for the preservation of them , is a thing so evident , that everybody grants it . ” Mr. Chariton , in his History of Whitby , points out the true origin of the fable , from the number of sea-gulls that , when flying from a storm , often alight near Whitby ; and from the woodcocks , and other birds of passage , who do the same upon their arrival on shore , after a long flight . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>Stanza XIV . line 257 . ‘ St. Cuthbert was , in the choice of his sepulchre , one of the most mutable and unreasonable saints in the Calendar . He died A. D. 688 , in a hermitage upon the Farne Islands , having resigned the bishopric of Lindisfarne , or Holy Island , about two years before . { 1 } His body was brought to Lindisfarne , where it remained until a descent of the Danes , about 793 , when the monastery was nearly destroyed . The monks fled to Scotland , with what they deemed their chief treasure , the relics of St. Cuthbert . The Saint was , however , a most capricious fellow-traveller ; which was the more intolerable , as , like Sinbad 's Old Man of the Sea , he journeyed upon the shoulders of his companions . They paraded him through Scotland for several years , and came as far west as Whithorn , in Galloway , whence they attempted to sail for Ireland , but were driven back by tempests . He at length made a halt at Norham ; from thence he went to Melrose , where he remained stationary for a short time , and then caused himself to be launched upon the Tweed in a stone coffin , which landed him at Tilmouth , in Northumberland . This boat is finely shaped , ten feet long , three feet and a half in diameter , and only four inches thick ; so that , with very little assistance , it might certainly have swam : it still lies , or at least did so a few years ago , in two pieces , beside the ruined chapel at Tilmouth . From Tilmouth , Cuthbert wandered into Yorkshire ; and at length made a long stay at Chester-le-street , to which the bishop 's see was transferred . At length , the Danes continuing to infest the country , the monks removed to Rippon for a season ; and it was in return from thence to Chester-le-street , that , passing through a forest called Dunholme , the Saint and his carriage became immovable at a place named Wardlaw , or Wardilaw . Here the Saint chose his place of residence ; and all who have seen Durham must admit , that , if difficult in his choice , he evinced taste in at last fixing it . It is said , that the Northumbrian Catholics still keep secret the precise spot of the Saint 's sepulture , which is only intrusted to three persons at a time . When one dies the survivors associate to them , in his room , a person judged fit to be the depositary of so valuable a secret . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>‘ The resting-place of the remains of this Saint is not now matter of uncertainty . So recently as 17th May , 1827 ,— 1139 years after his death — their discovery and disinterment were effected . Under a blue stone , in the middle of the shrine of St. Cuthbert , at the eastern extremity of the choir of Durham Cathedral , there was then found a walled grave , containing the coffins of the Saint . The first , or outer one , was ascertained to be that of 1541 , the second of 1041 ; the third , or inner one , answering in every particular to the description of that of 698 , was found to contain , not indeed , as had been averred then , and even until 1539 , the incorruptible body , but the entire skeleton of the Saint ; the bottom of the grave being perfectly dry , free from offensive smell , and without the slightest symptom that a human body had ever undergone decomposition within its walls . The skeleton was found swathed in five silk robes of emblematical embroidery , the ornamental parts laid with gold leaf , and these again covered with a robe of linen . Beside the skeleton were also deposited several gold and silver insignia , and other relics of the Saint .</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ ( The Roman Catholics now allow that the coffin was that of St .</l>
     <l n="2">Cuthbert . )</l>
   </lg>
   <p>‘ The bones of the Saint were again restored to the grave in a new coffin , amid the fragments of the former ones . Those portions of the inner coffin which could be preserved , including one of its rings , with the silver altar , golden cross , stole , comb , two maniples , bracelets , girdle , gold wire of the skeleton , and fragments of the five silk robes , and seme of the rings of the outer coffin made in 1541 , were deposited in the library of the Dean and Chapter , where they are now preserved . ’ — LOCKHART .</p>

The conquerors were at least as much indebted to the jealousy and intractability of the different tribes who composed David 's army ; among whom , as mentioned in the text , were the Galwegians , the Britons of Strath - Clyde , the men of Teviotdale and Lothian , with many Norman and German warriors , who asserted the cause of the Empress Maud . See Chalmers 's “ Caledonia , ” vol . i. p. 622 ; a most laborious , curious , and interesting publication , from which considerable defects of style and manner ought not to turn aside the Scottish antiquary .</p>
   <p>‘ Cuthbert , we have seen , had no great reason , to spare the Danes , when opportunity offered . Accordingly , I find in Simeon of Durham , that the Saint appeared in a vision to Alfred , when lurking in the marches of Glastonbury , and promised him assistance and victory over his heathen enemies ; a consolation which , as was reasonable , Alfred , after the battle of Ashendown , rewarded , by a royal offering at the shrine of the Saint . As to William the Conqueror , the terror spread before his army , when he marched to punish the revolt of the Northumbrians , in 1096 , had forced the monks to fly once more to Holy Island with the body of the Saint . It was , however , replaced before William left the north ; and , to balance accounts , the Conqueror having intimated an indiscreet curiosity to view the Saint 's body , he was , while in the act of commanding the shrine to be opened , seized with heat and sickness , accompanied with such a panic terror , that , notwithstanding there was a sumptuous dinner prepared for him , he fled without eating a morsel ( which the monkish historian seems to have thought no small part both of the miracle and the penance ,) and never drew his bridle till he got to the river Tees . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

While at this task , he is supposed to sit during the night upon a certain rock , and use another as his anvil . This story was perhaps credited in former days ; at least the Saint 's legend contains some not more probable . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>Stanza XVII . line 316 . ‘ Ceolwolf , or Colwulf , King of Northumberland , flourished in the eighth century . He was a man of some learning ; for the venerable Bede dedicates to him his “ Ecclesiastical History . ” He abdicated the throne about 738 , and retired to Holy Island , where he died in the odour of sanctity . Saint as Colwulf was , however , I fear the foundation of the penance - vault does not correspond with his character ; for it is recorded among his memorabilia , that , finding the air of the island raw and cold , he indulged the monks , whose rule had hitherto confined them to milk or water , with the comfortable privilege of using wine or ale . If any rigid antiquary insists on this objection , he is welcome to suppose the penance-vault was intended by the founder for the more genial purposes of a cellar .</p>
   <p>‘ These penitential vaults were the Geissel-gewolbe of German convents . In the earlier and more rigid times of monastic discipline , they were sometimes used as a cemetery for the lay benefactor of the convent , whose unsanctified corpses were then seldom permitted to pollute the choir . They also served as places of meeting for the chapter , when measures of uncommon severity were to be adopted . But their most frequent use , as implied by the name , was as places for performing penances , or undergoing punishment . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>Stanza XIX . line 371 . ‘ That there was an ancient priory at Tynemouth is certain . Its ruins are situated on a high rocky point ; and , doubtless , many a vow was made to the shrine by the distressed mariners , who drove towards the iron-bound coast of Northumberland in stormy weather . It was anciently a nunnery ; for Virca , abbess of Tynemouth , presented St. Cuthbert ( yet alive ) with a rare winding - sheet , in emulation of a holy lady called Tuda , who had sent him a coffin : but , as in the case of Whitby , and of Holy Island , the introduction of nuns at Tynemouth , in the reign of Henry VIII , is an anachronism . The nunnery of Holy Island is altogether fictitious . Indeed , St. Cuthbert was unlikely to permit such an establishment ; for , notwithstanding his accepting the mortuary gifts above mentioned , and his carrying on a visiting acquaintance with the abbess of Coldingham , he certainly hated the whole female sex ; and , in revenge of a slippery trick played to him by an Irish princess , he , after death , inflicted severe penances on such as presumed to approach within a certain distance of his shrine . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 376. ruth ( A. S. hreow , pity ) in Early and Middle English was used both for ‘ disaster ’ and ‘ pity . ’ These two shades of meaning are illustrated by Spenser in F. Q ., Bk . ii . I.

A small niche , sufficient to enclose their bodies , was made in the massive wall of the convent ; a slender pittance of food and water was deposited in it , and the awful words , VADE IN PACE , were the signal for immuring the criminal . It is not likely that , in latter times , this punishment was often resorted to ; but among the ruins of the abbey of Coldingham , were some years ago discovered the remains of a female skeleton , which , from the shape of the niche , and position of the figure , seemed to be that of an immured nun . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>lines 524-40 . The reference in these lines is to what was known as the appeal to the judgment of God . On this subject , Scott at the close of the second head in his ‘ Essay on Chivalry , ’ says , ‘ In the appeal to this awful criterion , the combatants , whether personally concerned , or appearing as champions , were understood , in martial law , to take on themselves the full risk of all consequences . And , as the defendant , or his champion , in case of being overcome , was subjected to the punishment proper to the crime of which he was accused , so the appellant , if vanquished , was , whether a principal or substitute , condemned to the same doom to which his success would have exposed the accused . Whichever combatant was vanquished he was liable to the penalty of degradation ; and , if he survived the combat , the disgrace to which he was subjected was worse than death . His spurs were cut off close to his heels , with a cook 's cleaver ; his arms were baffled and reversed by the common hangman ; his belt was cut to pieces , and his sword broken . Even his horse shared his disgrace , the animal 's tail being cut off , close by the rump , and thrown on a dunghill . The death-bell tolled , and the funeral service was said for a knight thus degraded as for one dead to knightly honour . And if he fell in the appeal to the judgment of God , the same dishonour was done to his senseless corpse . If alive , he was only rescued from death to be confined in the cloister . Such at least were the strict roles of Chivalry , though the courtesy of the victor , or the clemency of the prince , might remit them in favourable cases . ’</p>
   <p>For illustration of forms observed at such contests , see Richard II , i . 3 .</p>

Fr . croiser ; Fr . croix = cross ) is used both for the staff of an archbishop with a cross on the top , and for the staff of a bishop or an abbot , terminating in a carved or ornamented curve or crook . The word is used here metaphorically for Papal power , as Bacon uses it , speaking of Anselm and Becket , ‘ who with their CROSIERS did almost try it with the king 's sword . ’ Constance 's prophecy refers to Henry VIII 's victorious collision with the Pope .</p>

   <p>line 620 . The custom of ringing the PASSING bell grew out of the belief that a church bell , rung when the soul was passing from the body , terrified the devils that were waiting to attack it at the moment of its escape . ‘ The tolling of the passing bell was retained at the Reformation ; and the people were instructed that its use was to admonish the living , and excite them to pray for the dying . But by the beginning of the l8th century the passing bell in the proper sense of the term had almost ceased to be heard . ‘ A mourning bell is still rung during funeral services as a mark of respect . See s. v. ‘ Bell , ’ Chambers 's Encyclopaedia . Cp . Byron 's ‘ Parisina , ’ St. xv .</p>

   </lg>
   <p>In criticising ‘ Marmion , ’ in the Edinburgh Review , Lord Jeffrey says that the sound of the knell rung for Constance ‘ is described with great force and solemnity ; ’ while a writer in the Scots Magazine of 1808 considers that ‘ the whole of this trial and doom presents a high-wrought scene of horror , which , at the close , rises almost to too great a pitch . ’</p>
   <p>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO THIRD .</p>
   <p>‘ William Erskine , Esq . advocate , sheriff-depute of the Orkneys , became a Judge of the Court of Session by the title of Lord Kinnedder , and died in Edinburgh in August , 1823 . He had been from early youth the most intimate of the Poet 's friends , and his chief confidant and adviser as to all literary matters . See a notice of his life and character by the late Mr. Hay Donaldson , to which Sir Walter Scott contributed several paragraphs . ’ — LOCKHART .</p>
   <p>There are frequent references to Erskine throughout Lockhart 's Life of Scott . The critics of the time were of his opinion that Scott as a poet was not giving his powers their proper direction . Jeffrey considered Marmion ‘ a misapplication in some degree of extraordinary talents . ’ Fortunately , Scott decided for himself in the matter , and the self-criticism of this Introduction is characterised not only by good humour and poetic beauty but by discrimination and strong common-sense .</p>
   <p>line 14. a morning dream . This may simply be a poetic way of saying that his method is unsystematic , but Horace 's account of the vision he saw when he was once tempted to write Greek verses is irresistibly suggested by the expression :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Vetuit me tali voce Quirinus</l>
     <l n="2">Post mediam noctem visus , cum somnia vera :</l>
     <l n="3">“ In silvam non ligna feras insanius , ac si</l>

     <l n="5">Sat . I. x . 32 .</l>
   </lg>
   <p>line 24. all too well . This use of ‘ all too ’ is a development of the Elizabethan expression ‘ all-to ’ = ALTOGETHER , QUITE , as ‘ all to topple , ’ Pericles , iii . 2 . 17 ; ‘ all to ruffled , ’ Comus , 380 . In this usage the original force of TO as a verbal prefix is lost sight of . Chaucer has ‘ The pot to breaketh ’ in Prologue to Chanon Yeomanes Tale . See note in Clarendon Press Milton , i . 290 .</p>
   <p>line 26 . Desultory song may naturally command a very wide class of those intelligent readers , for whom the Earl of Iddesleigh , in ‘ lectures and Essays , ’ puts forward a courageous plea in his informing and genial address on the uses of Desultory Reading .</p>
   <p>line 28 . The reading of the first edition is ‘ loftier , ’ which conveys an estimate of his own achievements more characteristic of Scott than the bare assertion of his ability to ‘ build the lofty rhyme ’ which is implied in the line as it stands . Perhaps the expression just quoted from ‘ Lycidas ’ may have led to the reading of all subsequent editions .</p>
   <p>line 46 . The Duke of Brunswick commanded the Prussian forces at Jena , 14 Oct ., 1806 , and was mortally wounded . He was 72 . For ‘ hearse , ’ cp . above , Introd . to I . 199 .</p>
   <p>line 54 . The reigning house of Prussia comes from the Electors of Brandenburg . In 1415 Frederick VI . of Hohenzollern and Nuremberg became Frederick the First , Elector of Brandenburg . The Duchy of Prussia fell under the sway of the Elector John Sigismund ( 1608-19 ) , and from that time to the present there has been a very remarkable development of government and power . See Carlyle 's ‘ Frederick the Great , ’ and Mr. Baring-Gould 's ‘ Germany ’ in the series ‘ Stories of the Nations . ’</p>
   <p>lines 57-60 . The Duke of Brunswick was defeated at Valmy in 1792 , and so failed to crush the dragon of the French Revolution in its birth , as in all likelihood he would have done had he been victorious on the occasion .</p>
   <p>line 64 . Prussia , without an ally , took the field instead of acting on the defensive .</p>
   <p>line 67. seem 'd = beseemed , befitted ; as in Spenser 's May eclogue , ‘ Nought seemeth sike strife , ’ i. e . such strife is not befitting or seemly .</p>
   <p>line 69 . Various German princes lost their dominions after Napoleon conquered Prussia .</p>
   <p>line 78 . By defeating Varus , A. D. 9 , Arminius saved Germany from Roman conquest . See the first two books of the Annals of Tacitus , at the close of which this tribute is paid to the hero : ‘ liberator haud dubie Germaniae et qui non primordia populi Romani , sicut alii reges ducesque , sed florentissimum imperium lacessierit , proeliis ambiguus , bello non victus . ’</p>
   <p>lines 46-80 . This undoubtedly vigorous and well-sustained tribute is not without its special purpose . The Princess Caroline was daughter of the Duke of Brunswick , and Scott was one of those who believed in her , in spite of that ‘ careless levity ’ which he did not fail to note in her demeanour when presented at her Court at Blackheath in 1806 . This passage on the Duke of Brunswick had been read by the Princess before the appearance of ‘ Marmion . ’ Lockhart ( Life of Scott , ii . 117 ) says : ‘ He seems to have communicated fragments of the poem very freely during the whole of its progress . As early as the 22nd February , 1807 , I find Mrs. Hayman acknowledging , in the name of the Princess of Wales , the receipt of a copy of the Introduction to Canto III , in which occurs the tribute to her Royal Highness 's heroic father , mortally wounded the year before at Jena — a tribute so grateful to her feelings that she herself shortly after sent the poet an elegant silver vase as a memorial of her thankfulness . ’</p>
   <p>line 81 . The Red-Cross hero is Sir Sidney Smith , the famous admiral , who belonged to the Order of Knights Templars . The eight-pointed Templar 's cross which he wore throughout his career is said to have belonged to Richard Coeur-de-Lion . In early life , with consent of the Government , Smith distinguished himself with the Swedes in their war with Russia . He was frequently entrusted with the duty of alarming the French coast , and once was captured and imprisoned , in the Temple at Paris , for two years . His escape was effected by a daring stratagem on the part of the French Royalist party . He and his sailors helped the Turks to retain St. Jean d'Acre against Napoleon , till then the ‘ Invincible , ’ who retired baffled after a vain siege of sixty days ( May , 1799 ) . Had Acre been won , said Napoleon afterwards , ‘ I would have reached Constantinople and the Indies — I would have changed the face of the world . ’ See Scott 's ‘ Life of Napoleon , ’ chap . xiii .</p>

   <p>lines 100-10 . Scott pays compliment to his friend Joanna Baillie ( 1764-1851 ) , with chivalrous courtesy asserting that she is the first worthy successor of Shakespeare . ‘ Count Basil ’ and ‘ De Montfort ’ are the two most remarkable of her ‘ Plays of the Passions , ’ of which she published three volumes . ‘ De Montfort ’ was played in London , Kemble enacting the hero .

   <p>Stanza I. Mr. Guthrie Wright , advocate , prosaically objected to the indirect route chosen by the poet for his troopers .

   <p>line 33 . ‘ The accommodations of a Scottish hostelrie , or inn , in the sixteenth century , may be collected from Dunbar 's admirable tale of “ The Friars of Berwick . ” Simon Lawder , “ the gay ostlier , ” seems to have lived very comfortably ; and his wife decorated her person with a scarlet kirtle , and a belt of silk and silver , and rings upon her fingers ; and feasted her paramour with rabbits , capons , partridges , and Bourdeaux wine . At least , if the Scottish inns were not good , it was not from want of encouragement from the legislature ; who , so early as the reign of James I , not only enacted , that in all boroughs and fairs there be hostellaries , having stables and chambers , and provision for man and horse , but by another statute , ordained that no man , travelling on horse or foot , should presume to lodge anywhere except in these hostellaries ; and that no person , save innkeepers , should receive such travellers , under the penalty of forty shillings , for exercising such hospitality . But , in spite of these provident enactments , the Scottish hostels are but indifferent , and strangers continue to find reception in the houses of individuals . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>It is important to supplement this note by saying that the most competent judges still doubt whether Dunbar wrote ‘ The Friars of Berwick . ’ It is printed among his doubtful works .</p>
   <p>Stanza III . Such a kitchen as that described was common in Scotland till recent times , and relics of a similar interior exist in remote parts still . The wide chimney , projecting well into the floor , formed a capacious tunnel to the roof , and numerous sitters could be accommodated with comfort in front and around the fire . Smoke and soot from the wood and peat fuel were abundant , and the ‘ winter cheer , ’ — hams , venison , &amp; c .— hung from the uncovered rafters , were well begrimed before coming to the table .</p>

   <p>Stanza VIII . line 120 . St. Valentine 's day is Feb. 14 , when birds pair and lovers ( till at any rate recent times ) exchange artistic tokens of affection .

   <p>line 122 . The myth of Philomela has been a favourite with English sentimental poets . The Elizabethan Barnefield writes the typical lyric on the theme . These lines contain the myth :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ She , poor bird , as all forlorn ,</l>
     <l n="2">Lean 'd her breast against a thorn ,</l>

   <p>Stanza IX . In days when harvesting was done with the sickle , reapers from the Highlands and from Ireland came in large numbers to the Scottish Lowlands and cut the crops . At one time a piper played characteristic melodies behind the reapers to give them spirit for their work . Hence comes —</p>
   <p>‘ Wha will gar our shearers shear ? Wha will bind up the brags of weir ? ’</p>
   <p>in a lyric by Hamilton of Gilbertfield ( 1665-1751 ) . The reaper 's song is the later representative of this practice . See Wordsworth 's ‘ Solitary Highland Reaper ’ — immortalized by her suggestive and memorable singing — and compare the pathetic ‘ Exile 's Song ’ of Robert Gilfillan ( 1798-1850 ):—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Oh ! here no Sabbath bell</l>
     <l n="2">Awakes the Sabbath morn ;</l>
     <l n="3">Nor song of reapers heard</l>

   <p>For references to Susquehanna and the home-longing of the exile , see Campbell 's ‘ Gertrude of Wyoming , ’ I. i. - vi . The introduction of reaping-machines has minimised the music and poetry of the harvest field .</p>
   <p>Stanzas X , XI . The two pictures in the song are very effectively contrasted both in spirit and style .

The burden ‘ eleu loro ’ has been somewhat uncertainly connected with the Italian ela loro , ‘ alas ! for them . ’</p>

   <p>line 325 . Alexander III ( 1240-1286 ) came to the throne at the age of nine , and proved himself a vigorous and large-hearted king . He was killed by a fall from his horse , near Kinghorn , Fife , where there is a suitable monument to his memory . The contemporary lament for his death bewails him as one that ‘ Scotland led in love and lee . ’ Sir Walter Scott ( Introductory Remarks to ‘ Border Minstrelsy ’ ) calls him ‘ the last Scottish king of the pure Celtic race . ’</p>
   <p>line 333 . ‘ A vaulted hall under the ancient castle of Gifford , or Yester ( for it bears either name indifferently ) , the construction of which has , from a very remote period , been ascribed to magic . The Statistical Account of the Parish of Garvald and Baro , gives the following account of the present state of this castle and apartment :— “ Upon a peninsula , formed by the water of Hopes on the east , and a large rivulet on the west , stands the ancient castle of Yester . Sir David Dalrymple , in his annals , relates that ‘ Hugh Gifford de Yester died in 1267 ; that in his castle there was a capacious cavern , formed by magical art , and called in the country Bo-Hall , i. e . Hobgoblin Hall . ’ A stair of twenty-four steps led down to this apartment , which is a large and spacious hall , with an arched roof ; and though it hath stood for so many centuries , and been exposed to the external air for a period of fifty or sixty years , it is still as firm and entire as if it had only stood a few years . From the floor of this hall , another stair of thirty-six steps leads down to a pit which hath a communication with Hopes - water . A great part of the walls of this large and ancient castle are still standing . There is a tradition that the castle of Yester was the last fortification , in this country , that surrendered to General Gray , sent into Scotland by Protector Somerset . ” — Statistical Account , vol . xiii . I have only to add , that , in 1737 , the Goblin Hall was tenanted by the Marquis of Tweedale 's falconer , as I learn from a poem by Boyse , entitled “ Retirement , ” written upon visiting Yester . It is now rendered inaccessible by the fall of the stair .</p>
   <p>‘ Sir David Dalrymple 's authority for the anecdote is in Fordun , whose words are :— “ A. D. MCCLXVII . Hugo Giffard de Yester moritur ; cujus castrum , vel saltem caveam , et donglonem , arte daemonica antique relationes ferunt fabrifactas : nam ibidem habetur mirabilis specus subterraneus , opere mirifico constructus , magno terrarum spatio protelatus , qui communiter BO-HALL appellatus est . ” Lib . x. cap . 21 .— Sir David conjectures , that Hugh de Gifford must either have been a very wise man , or a great oppressor . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

     <l n="1">Stanza XX . line 354 . ‘ In 1263 , Haco , King of Norway , came into the</l>

   </lg>
   <p>line 358 . Ayrshire in early times comprised three divisions , Cunninghame in the north , Kyle between the Irvine and the Doon , and Carrick to the south of that stream . Burns , by his song ‘ There was a Lad was born in Kyle , ’ has immortalised the middle division , which an old proverb had distinguished as productive of men , in contradistinction to the dairy produce and the stock of the other two .</p>
   <p>line 362 . ‘ " Magicians , as is well known , were very curious in the choice and form of their vestments . Their caps are oval , or like pyramids , with lappets on each side , and fur within . Their gowns are long , and furred with fox-skins , under which they have a linen garment reaching to the knee . Their girdles are three inches broad , and have many cabalistical names , with crosses , trines , and circles inscribed on them . Their shoes should be of new russet leather , with a cross cut upon them . Their knives are dagger-fashion ; and their swords have neither guard nor scabbard . ” — See these , and many other particulars , in the Discourse concerning Devils and Spirits , annexed to REGINALD SCOTT 'S Discovery of Witchcraft , edition 1665 . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 369 . Scott quotes thus from Reginald Scott 's ‘ Discovery of Witchcraft ’ ( 1665 ):—</p>
   <p>‘ A pentacle is a piece of fine linen , folded with five corners , according to the five senses , and suitably inscribed with characters . This the magician extends towards the spirits which he invokes , when they are stubborn and rebellious , and refuse to be conformable unto the ceremonies and rights of magic . ’</p>
   <p>line 373 . The term ‘ Combust ’ is applied to the moon or the planets , when , through being not more than eight and a half degrees from the sun , they are invisible in his light . Chaucer , in the ‘ Astrolabe , ’ has ‘ that he be not retrograd ne COMBUST . ’ ‘ Retrograde ’ is the term descriptive of the motion of the planets from east to west . This is the case when the planets are visible on the side opposite to the sun . See Airy 's ‘ Popular Astronomy , ’ p. 124 . ‘ Trine ’ refers to the appearance of planets ‘ distant from each other 120 degrees , or the third part of the zodiac . ‘ Trine was considered a favourable conjunction .

   <p>line 503 . Scott quotes thus from the essay on ‘ Fairy Superstitions ’ in the ‘ Border Minstrelsy , ’ vol . ii ., to show ‘ whence many of the particulars of the combat between Alexander III and the Goblin Knight are derived ':—</p>
   <p>‘ Gervase of Tilbury ( Otia Imperial ap . Script , rer . Brunsvic , vol . i. p. 797 ) , relates the following popular story concerning a fairy knight : “ Osbert , a bold and powerful baron , visited a noble family in the vicinity of Wandlebury , in the bishopric of Ely . Among other stories related in the social circle of his friends , who , according to custom , amused each other by repeating ancient tales and traditions , he was informed , that if any knight , unattended , entered an adjacent plain by moonlight , and challenged an adversary to appear , he would be immediately encountered by a spirit in the form of a knight . Osbert resolved to make the experiment , and set out , attended by a single squire , whom he ordered to remain without the limits of the plain , which was surrounded by an ancient intrenchment . On repeating the challenge , he was instantly assailed by an adversary , whom he quickly unhorsed , and seized the reins of his steed . Daring this operation , his ghostly opponent sprung up , and darting his spear , like a javelin , at Osbert , wounded him in the thigh . Osbert returned in triumph with the horse , which he committed to the care of his servants . The horse was of a sable colour , as well as his whole accoutrements , and apparently of great beauty and vigour . He remained with his keeper till cock-crowing , when , with eyes flashing fire , he reared , spurned the ground , and vanished . On disarming himself , Osbert perceived that he was wounded , and that one of his steel boots was full of blood . ” Gervase adds , that , “ as long as he lived , the scar of his wound opened afresh on the anniversary of the eve on which he encountered the spirit . ” Less fortunate was the gallant Bohemian knight , who travelling by night with a single companion , “ came in sight of a fairy host , arrayed under displayed banners . Despising the remonstrances of his friend , the knight pricked forward to break a lance with a champion , who advanced from the ranks apparently in defiance . His companion beheld the Bohemian overthrown , horse and man , by his aerial adversary ; and returning to the spot next morning , he found the mangled corpses of the knight and steed . ” — Hierarchy of Blessed Angels , p. 554 .</p>
   <p>‘ Besides these instances of Elfin chivalry above quoted , many others might be alleged in support of employing fairy machinery in this manner . The forest of Glenmore , in the North Highlands , is believed to be haunted by a spirit called Lham-dearg , in the array of an ancient warrior , having a bloody hand , from which he takes his name . He insists upon those with whom he meets doing battle with him ; and the clergyman , who makes up an account of the district , extant in the Macfarlane MS ., in the Advocates ’ Library , gravely assures us , that , in his time , Lham-dearg fought with three brothers whom he met in his walk , none of whom long survived the ghostly conflict . Barclay , in his “ Euphormion , ” gives a singular account of an officer who had ventured , with his servant , rather to intrude upon a haunted house , in a town in Flanders , than to put up with worse quarters elsewhere . After taking the usual precautions of providing fires , lights , and arms , they watched till midnight , when , behold ! the severed arm of a man dropped from the ceiling ; this was followed by the legs , the other arm , the trunk , and the head of the body , all separately . The members rolled together , united themselves in the presence of the astonished soldiers , and formed a gigantic warrior , who defied them both to combat . Their blows , although they penetrated the body , and amputated the limbs , of their strange antagonist , had , as the reader may easily believe , little effect on an enemy who possessed such powers of self-union ; nor did his efforts make more effectual impression upon them . How the combat terminated I do not exactly remember , and have not the book by me ; but I think the spirit made to the intruders on his mansion the usual proposal , that they should renounce their redemption ; which being declined , he was obliged to retreat .</p>
   <p>‘ The most singular tale of this kind is contained in an extract communicated to me by my friend Mr. Surtees of Mainsforth , in the Bishopric , who copied it from a MS. note in a copy of Burthogge “ On the Nature of Spirits , ” 8vo , 1694 , which had been the property of the late Mr. Gill , attorney-general to Egerton , Bishop of Durham . “ It was not , ” says my obliging correspondent ” in Mr. Gill 's own hand , but probably an hundred years older , and was said to be , E libro Convent . Dunelm . per T. C . extract ., whom I believe to have been Thomas Cradocke , Esq ., barrister , who held several offices under the See of Durham a hundred years ago .

   <p>“ Rem miram hujusmodi que nostris temporibus evenit , teste viro nobili ac fide dignissimo , enarrare haud pigebit . Radulphus Bulmer , cum e castris , quae tunc temporis prope Norham posita erant , oblectationis causa , exiisset , ac in ulteriore Tuedae ripa praaedam cum canibus leporariis insequeretur , forte cum Scoto quodam nobili , sibi antehac , ut videbatur , familiariter cognito , congressus est ; ac , ut fas erat inter inimicos , flagrante bello , brevissima interrogationis mora interposita , alterutros invicem incitato cursu infestis animis petiere . Noster , primo occursu , equo praeacerrimo hostis impetu labante , in terram eversus pectore et capite laeso , sanguinem , mortuo similis , evomebat . Quern ut se aegre habentem comiter allocutus est alter , pollicitusque , modo auxilium non abnegaret , monitisque obtemperans ab omni rerum sacrarum cogitatione abstineret , nec Deo , Deiparae Virgini , Sanctove ullo , preces aut vota efferret vel inter sese conciperet , se brevi eum sanum validumque restiturum esse . Prae angore oblata conditio accepta est ; ac veterator ille nescio quid obscaeni murmuris insusurrans , prehensa manu , dicto citius in pedes sanum ut antea sublevavit . Noster autem , maxima prae rei inaudita novitate formidine perculsus , MI JESU ! exclamat , vel quid simile ; ac subito respiciens nec hostem nec ullum alium conspicit , equum solum gravissimo nuper casu afflictum , per summam pacem in rivo fluvii pascentem . Ad castra itaque mirabundus revertens , fidei dubius , rem primo occultavit , dein , confecto bello , Confessori suo totam asseruit . Delusoria procul dubio res tota , ac mala veteratoris illius aperitur fraus , qua hominem Christianum ad vetitum tale auxilium pelliceret . Nomen utcunque illius ( nobilis alias ac clari ) reticendum duco , cum haud dubium sit quin Diabolus , Deo permittente , formam quam libuerit , immo angeli lucis , sacro oculo Dei teste , posse assumere . ”</p>

Sir David Lyndsay 's exposure of ecclesiastical abuses in his various satires , especially in his ‘ Complaynts ’ and his Dialog , ‘ powerfully forwarded the movement that culminated in the Reformation . It would , however , be a mistake to consider him an avowed Protestant reformer . He was concerned about the existing wrongs both of Church and State , and thought of rectifying these without revolutionary measures .</p>

   <p>lines 141-4 . The double tressure was an ornamental tracing round the shield , at a fixed distance from the border . As to the fleur-de-lis ( flower of the lily , emblem of France ) Scott quotes Boethius and Buchanan as saying that it was ‘ first assumed by Achaius , king of Scotland , contemporary of Charlemagne , and founder of , the celebrated League with France . ’ Historical evidence , however , would seem to show that ‘ the lion is first seen on the seal of Alexander II , and the tressure on that of Alexander III . ’ This is the heraldic description of the arms of Scotland : ‘ Or , a lion rampant gules , armed and langued azure , within a double tressure flory counterflory of fleur-de-lis of the second . ’ The supporters are ‘ two unicorns argent maned and unguled , or gorged with open crowns . ’ The crest is ‘ a lion sejant affronte gules crowned or , ’ &amp; c. The adoption of the thistle as the national Scottish emblem is wrapt in obscurity , although an early poet attributes it to a suggestion of Venus .</p>
   <p>line 153 . Scott mentions Chalmers 's edition of Lyndsay 's works , published in 1806 . More recent and very satisfactory editions are those of Dr. David Laing , ( 1 ) a library edition in three volumes , and ( 2 ) a popular edition in two . Lyndsay was born about 1490 and died about 1555 . The Mount was his estate , near Cupar-Fife . ‘ I am uncertain , ’ says Scott , ‘ if I abuse poetic license , by introducing Sir David Lindesay in the character of Lion-Herald , sixteen years before he obtained that office . At any rate , I am not the first who has been guilty of that anachronism ; for the author of “ Flodden Field ” despatches Dallamount , which can mean nobody but Sir David de la Mont , to France on the message of defiance from James IV to Henry VIII . It was often an office imposed on the Lion King-at-arms , to receive foreign ambassadors ; and Lindesay himself did this honour to Sir Ralph Sadler , in 1539-40 . Indeed , the oath of the Lion , in its first article , bears reference to his frequent employment upon royal messages and embassies . The office of heralds , in feudal times , being held of the utmost importance , the inauguration of the Kings - at-arms , who presided over their colleges , was proportionally solemn . In fact , it was the mimicry of a royal coronation , except that the unction was made with wine instead of oil . In Scotland , a namesake and kinsman of Sir David Lindesay , inaugurated in 1502 , “ was crowned by King James with the ancient crown of Scotland , which was used before the Scottish Kings assumed a close Crown ; ” and , on occasion of the same solemnity , dined at the King 's table , wearing the crown . It is probable that the coronation of his predecessor was not less solemn . So sacred was the herald 's office , that , in 1515 , Lord Drummond was by Parliament declared guilty of treason , and his lands forfeited , because he had struck , with his fist , the Lion King-at-arms , when he reproved him for his follies . Nor was he restored , but at the Lion 's earnest solicitation . ’</p>
   <p>Stanza X. line 194 . ‘ A large ruinous castle on the banks of the Tyne , about ten miles from Edinburgh . As indicated in the text , it was built at different times , and with a very differing regard to splendour and accommodation . The oldest part of the building is a narrow keep , or tower , such as formed the mansion of a lesser Scottish baron ; but so many additions have been made to it , that there is now a large courtyard , surrounded by buildings of different ages . The eastern front of the court is raised above a portico , and decorated with entablatures , bearing anchors . All the stones of this front are cut into diamond facets , the angular projections of which have an uncommonly rich appearance . The inside of this part of the building appears to have contained a gallery of great length , and uncommon elegance . Access was given to it by a magnificent stair - case , now quite destroyed . The soffits are ornamented with twining cordage and rosettes : and the whole seems to have been far more splendid than was usual in Scottish castles . The castle belonged originally to the Chancellor , Sir William Crichton , and probably owed to him its first enlargement , as well as its being taken by the Earl of Douglas , who imputed to Crichton 's counsels the death of his predecessor , Earl William , beheaded in Edinburgh Castle , with his brother , in 1440 . It is said to have been totally demolished on that occasion ; but the present state of the ruin shows the contrary . In 1483 it was garrisoned by Lord Crichton , then its proprietor , against King James III , whose displeasure he had incurred by seducing his sister Margaret , in revenge , it is said , for the Monarch having dishonoured his bed . From the Crichton family the castle passed to that of the Hepburns , Earls Bothwell ; and when the forfeitures of Stewart , the last Earl Bothwell , were divided , the barony and cattle of Crichton fell to the share of the Earl of Buccleuch . They were afterwards the property of the Pringles of Clifton , and are now that of Sir John Callander , Baronet . It were to be wished the proprietor would take a little pains to preserve those splendid remains of antiquity , which are at present used as a fold for sheep , and wintering cattle ; although , perhaps , there are very few ruins in Scotland which display so well the style and beauty of castle-architecture . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>The ruin is now carefully protected , visitors being admitted on application at Crichtoun Manse adjoining .</p>
   <p>Stanza XI . line 232 . ‘ The castle of Crichton has a dungeon vault , called the Massy More . The epithet , which is not uncommonly applied to the prisons of other old castles in Scotland , is of Saracenic origin . It occurs twice in the “ Epistolae Itineriae ” of Tollius . “ Carcer subterraneus , sive , ut Mauri appellant , MAZMORRA , ” p. 147 ; and again , “ Coguntur omnes Captivi sub noctem in ergastula subterranea , quae Turcae Algezerani vocant MAZMORRAS , ” p. 243 . The same word applies to the dungeons of the ancient Moorish castles in Spain , and serves to show from what nation the Gothic style of castle building was originally derived . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

Scott quotes from Lindsay of Pitscottie the story of the apparition seen at Linlithgow by James IV , when undergoing his annual penance for having taken the field against his father . Some of the younger men about the Court had devised what they felt might be an impressive warning to the King against going to war , and their show of supernatural interference was well managed . Lindsay 's narrative proceeds thus :—</p>
   <p>‘ The King came to Lithgow , where he happened to be for the time at the Council , very sad and dolorous , making his devotion to God , to send him good chance and fortune in his voyage . In this meantime , there came a man , clad in a blue gown , in at the kirk door , and belted about him in a roll of linen-cloth ; a pair of brotikings1 on his feet , to the great of his legs ; with all other hose and clothes conform thereto ; but he had nothing on his head , but syde2 red yellow hair behind , and on his haffets3 , which wan down to his shoulders ; but his forehead was bald and bare . He seemed to be a man of two-and-fifty years , with a great pike-staff in his hand , and came first forward among the lords , crying and speiring4 for the King , saying , he desired to speak with him . While , at the last , he came where the King was sitting in the desk , at his prayers , but when he saw the King , he made him little reverence or salutation , but leaned down groffling on the desk before him , and said to him in this manner , as after follows : “ Sir King , my mother hath sent me to you , desiring you not to pass , at this time , where thou art purposed ; for if thou does , thou wilt not fare well in thy journey , nor none that passeth with thee . Further , she bade thee mell5 with no woman , nor use their counsel , nor let them touch thy body , nor thou theirs ; for , if thou do it , thou wilt be confounded and brought to shame . ”</p>

   <p>‘ By this man had spoken thir words unto the King 's grace , the evening-song was near done , and the King paused on thir words , studying to give him an answer ; but , in the meantime , before the King 's eyes , and in the presence of all the lords that were about him for the time , this man vanished away , and could no ways be seen nor comprehended , but vanished away as he had been a blink of the sun , or a whip of the whirlwind , and could no more be seen . I heard say . Sir David Lindesay , Lyon-herauld , and John Inglis the marshal , who were , at that time , young men , and special servants to the King 's grace , were standing presently beside the King , who thought to have laid hands on this man , that they might have speired further tidings at him : But all for nought ; they could not touch him ; for he vanished away betwixt them , and was no more seen . ’ Buchanan , in more elegant , though not more impressive language , tells the same story , and quotes the personal information of our Sir David Lindesay : ‘ In iis , ( i. e . qui propius astiterant ) fuit David Lindesius , Montanus , homo spectatae fidei et probitatis , nec a literarum studiis alienus , et cujus totius vitae tenor longissime a mentiendo aberat ; a quo nisi ego haec uti tradidi , pro certis accepissem , ut vulgatam vanis rumoribus fabulam omissurus eram . ” — Lib . xiii . The King 's throne , in St. Catherine 's aisle , which he had constructed for himself , with twelve stalls for the Knights Companions of the Order of the Thistle , is still shown as the place where the apparition was seen . I know not by what means St. Andrew got the credit of having been the celebrated monitor of James IV ; for the expression in Lindesay 's narrative , “ My mother has sent me , ” could only be used by St. John , the adopted son of the Virgin Mary . The whole story is so well attested , that we have only the choice between a miracle or an imposture . Mr. Pinkerton plausibly argues , from the caution against incontinence , that the Queen was privy to the scheme of those who had recourse to this expedient , to deter King James from his impolitic war . ’</p>
   <p>Stanza XV . line 287 . ‘ In Scotland there are about twenty palaces , castles , and remains , or sites of such ,</p>
   <p>“ Where SCOTIA 'S kings of other years ”</p>
   <p>had their royal home .</p>
   <p>‘ Linlithgow , distinguished by the combined strength and beauty of its situation , must have been early selected as a royal residence . David , who bought the title of saint by his liberality to the Church , refers several of his charters to his town of Linlithgow ; and in that of Holyrood expressly bestows on the new monastery all the skins of the rams , ewes , and lambs , belonging to his castle of Linlitcu , which shall die during the year .... The convenience afforded for the sport of falconry , which was so great a favourite during the feudal ages , was probably one cause of the attachment of the ancient Scottish monarchs to Linlithgow and its fine lake . The sport of hunting was also followed with success in the neighbourhood , from which circumstance it probably arises that the ancient arms of the city represent a black greyhound bitch tied to a tree .... The situation of Linlithgow Palace is eminently beautiful . It stands on a promontory of some elevation , which advances almost into the midst of the lake . The form is that of a square court , composed of buildings of four storeys high , with towers at the angles . The fronts with the square , and the windows , are highly ornamented , and the size of the rooms , as well as the width and character of the staircases , are upon a magnificent scale . One banquet-room is ninety-four feet long , thirty feet wide , and thirty - three feet high , with a gallery for music . The King 's wardrobe , or dressing-room , looking to the west , projects over the walls , so as to have a delicious prospect on three aides , and is one of the most enviable boudoirs we have ever seen . ’ — SIR WALTER SCOTT 'S Provincial Antiquities .— Prose Works , vol . vii . p. 382 .</p>

BELL seems to be an abbreviation of bellow . This silvan sound conveyed great delight to our ancestors , chiefly , I suppose , from association .

Sauchie-burn , where James III fell , was fought 18 June , 1488 ., ‘ James IV , ’ says Scott , ‘ after the battle passed to Stirling , and hearing the monks of the chapel-royal deploring the death of his father , he was seized with deep remorse , which manifested itself in severe penances . ’ See below , note on V. ix .</p>

The earliest known mention of the thistle as the national badge is in the inventory of the effects of James III , Thistles were inscribed on the coins of the next four reigns , and they were accompanied in the reign of James VI for the first time by the motto Nemo me impune lacessit . James II of Great Britain formally inaugurated the Order of the Thistle on 29 May , 1687 , but it was not till the reign of Anne , 31 Dec. 1703 , that it became a fully defined legal institution . The Order is also known as the Order of St . Andrew .— See CHAMBERS 'S Encyclopedia .</p>

   <p>Stanza XXV . line 521 . ‘ The Borough , or Common Moor of Edinburgh , was of very great extent , reaching from the southern walls of the city to the bottom of Braid Hills . It was anciently a forest ; and , in that state , was so great a nuisance , that the inhabitants of Edinburgh had permission granted to them of building wooden galleries , projecting over the street , in order to encourage them to consume the timber ; which they seem to have done very effectually . When James IV mustered the array of the kingdom there , in 1513 , the Borough-moor was , according to Hawthornden , “ a field spacious , and delightful by the shade of many stately and aged oaks . ” Upon that , and similar occasions , the royal standard is traditionally said to have been displayed from the Hare Stane , a high stone , now built into the wall , on the left hand of the highway leading towards Braid , not far from the head of Bruntsfield Links . The Hare Stane probably derives its name from the British word Har , signifying an army . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

These white ridges , as I call them , that , as we stood on Fauxsyde Bray , did make so great muster toward us , which I did take then to be a number of tentes , when we came , we found it a linen drapery , of the coarser cambryk in dede , for it was all of canvas sheets , and wear the tenticles , or rather cabyns and couches of their soldiers ; the which ( much after the common building of their country beside ) had they framed of four sticks , about an ell long a piece , whereof two fastened together at one end aloft , and the two endes beneath stuck in the ground , an ell asunder , standing in fashion like the bowes of a sowes yoke ; over two such bowes ( one , as it were , at their head , the other at their feet ) , they stretched a sheet down on both sides , whereby their cabin became roofed like a ridge , but skant shut at both ends , and not very close beneath on the sides , unless their sticks were the shorter , or their wives the more liberal to lend them larger napery ; howbeit , when they had lined them , and stuff 'd them so thick with straw , with the weather as it was not very cold , when they wear ones couched , they were as warm as they had been wrapt in horses dung . ’ — PATTEN 'S Account of Somerset 's Expedition .</p>

The gates , and the greater part of the wall , have been pulled down , in the course of the late extensive and beautiful enlargement of the city .

In this note a doubt was formerly expressed whether Henry VI came to Edinburgh , though his Queen certainly did ; Mr. Pinkerton inclining to believe that he remained at Kirkcudbright . But my noble friend , Lord Napier , has pointed out to me a grant by Henry , of an annuity of forty marks to his Lordship 's ancestor , John Napier , subscribed by the King himself , AT EDINBURGH , the 28th day of August , in the thirtyninth year of his reign , which corresponds to the year of God , 1461 . This grant , Douglas , with his usual neglect of accuracy , dates in 1368 . But this error being corrected from the copy of Macfarlane 's MSS ., p. 119 , to , removes all scepticism on the subject of Henry VI being really at Edinburgh . John Napier was son and heir of Sir Alexander Napier , and about this time was Provost of Edinburgh . The hospitable reception of the distressed monarch and his family , called forth on Scotland the encomium of Molinet , a contemporary poet . The English people , he says ,—</p>

Thus , at the battle of Blackheath , between the troops of Henry VII and the Cornish insurgents , in 1496 , the bridge of Dartford was defended by a picked band of archers from the rebel army , “ whose arrows , ” says Holinshed , “ were in length a full cloth yard . ” The Scottish , according to Ascham , had a proverb , that every English archer carried under his belt twenty-four Scots , in allusion to his bundle of unerring shafts . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>line 35 . ‘ The Scottish burgesses were , like yeomen , appointed to be armed with bows and sheaves , sword , buckler , knife , spear , or a good axe instead of a bow , if worth L100 : their armour to be of white or bright harness .

   <p>‘ Bows and quivers were in vain recommended to the peasantry of Scotland , by repeated statutes ; spears and axes seem universally to have been used instead of them . The defensive armour was the plate - jack , hauberk , or brigantine ; and their missile weapons crossbows and culverins . All wore swords of excellent temper , according to Patten ; and a voluminous handkerchief round their neck , “ not for cold , but for cutting . ” The mace also was much used in the Scottish army !

   <p>Stanza IX . line 249 . ‘ Few readers need to be reminded of this belt , to the weight of which James added certain ounces every year that he lived . Pitscottie founds his belief that James was not slain in the battle of Flodden , because the English never had this token of the iron-belt to show to any Scottishman . The person and character of James are delineated according to our best historians . His romantic disposition , which led him highly to relish gaiety , approaching to license , was , at the same time , tinged with enthusiastic devotion . These propensities sometimes formed a strange contrast . He was wont , during his fits of devotion , to assume the dress , and conform to the rules , of the order of Franciscans ; and when he had thus done penance for some time in Stirling , to plunge again into the tide of pleasure . Probably , too , with no unusual inconsistency , he sometimes laughed at the superstitions observances to which he at other times subjected himself . There is a very singular poem by Dunbar , seemingly addressed to James IV , on one of these occasions of monastic seclusion . It is a most daring and profane parody on the services of the Church of Rome , entitled :—</p>

Our historians impute to the King 's infatuated passion the delays which led to the fatal defeat of Flodden . The author of “ The Genealogy of the Heron Family ” endeavours , with laudable anxiety , to clear the Lady Ford from this scandal ; that she came and went , however , between the armies of James and Surrey , is certain . See PINKERTON 'S History , and the authorities he refers to , vol . ii . p. 99 . Heron of Ford had been , in 1511 , in some sort accessory to the slaughter of Sir Robert Kerr of Cessford , Warden of the Middle Marches . It was committed by his brother the bastard , Lilburn , and Starked , three Borderers . Lilburn and Heron of Ford were delivered up by Henry to James , and were imprisoned in the fortress of Fastcastle , where the former died . Part of the pretence of Lady Ford 's negotiations with James was the liberty of her husband . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

She believed surely that he would recompense her again with some of his kingly support in her necessity ; that is to say , that he would raise her an army , and come three foot of ground on English ground , for her sake . To that effect she sent him a ring off her finger , with fourteen thousand French crowns to pay bis expenses . ” PITSCOTTIE , p. 110 .— A turquois ring — probably this fatal gift — is , with James 's sword and dagger , preserved in the College of Heralds , London . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>Stanza XIV . line 398 . ‘ Archibald Douglas , Earl of Angus , ’ says Scott , ‘ a man remarkable for strength of body and mind , acquired the popular name of Bell-the-Cat , upon the following remarkable occasion :— James the Third , of whom Pitscottie complains that he delighted more in music , and “ policies of building , ” than in hunting , hawking , and other noble exercises , was so ill advised as to make favourites of his architects and musicians , whom the same historian irreverently terms masons and fiddlers . His nobility , who did not sympathise in the King 's respect for the fine arts , were extremely incensed at the honours conferred on those persons , particularly on Cochrane , a mason , who had been created Earl of Mar ; and , seizing the opportunity , when , in 1482 , the King had convoked the whole array of the country to march against the English , they held a midnight council in the church of Lauder , for the purpose of forcibly removing these minions from the King 's person . When all had agreed on the propriety of this measure , Lord Gray told the assembly the apologue of the Mice , who had formed a resolution , that it would be highly advantageous to their community to tie a bell round the cat 's neck , that they might hear her approach at a distance ; but which public measure unfortunately miscarried , from no mouse being willing to undertake the task of fastening the bell . “ I understand the moral , ” said Angus , “ and , that what we propose may not lack execution , I will bell the cat . " ’</p>
   <p>The rest of the strange scene is thus told by Pitscottie :—</p>
   <p>‘ By this was advised and spoken by thir lords foresaid , Cochran , the Earl of Mar , came from the King to the council , ( which council was holden in the kirk of Lauder for the time ,) who was well accompanied with a band of men of war ; to the number of three hundred light axes , all clad in white livery , and black bends thereon , that they might be known for Cochran the Earl of Mar 's men . Himself was clad in a riding-pie of black velvet , with a great chain of gold about his neck , to the value of five hundred crowns , and four blowing horns , with both the ends of gold and silk , set with a precious stone , called a berryl , hanging in the midst . This Cochran had his heumont born before him , overgilt with gold , and so were all the rest of his horns , and all his pallions were of fine canvas of silk , and the cords thereof fine twined silk , and the chains upon his pallions were double overgilt with gold .</p>
   <p>‘ This Cochran was so proud in his conceit , that he counted no lords to be marrows to him , therefore he rushed rudely at the kirk-door . The council inquired who it was that perturbed them at that time . Sir Robert Douglas , Laird of Lochleven , was keeper of the kirk-door at that time , who inquired who that was that knocked so rudely ; and Cochran answered , “ This is I , the Earl of Mar . ” The which news pleased well the lords , because they were ready boun to cause take him , as is before rehearsed . Then the Earl of Angus past hastily to the door , and with him Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven , there to receive in the Earl of Mar , and go many of his complices who were there , as they thought good . And the Earl of Angus met with the Earl of Mar , as he came in at the door , and pulled the golden chain from his craig , and said to him , a tow1 would set him better . Sir Robert Douglas syne pulled the blowing horn from him in like manner , and said , “ He had been the hunter of mischief over long . ” This Cochran asked , “ My lords , is it mows2 , or earnest ? ” They answered , and said , “ It is good earnest , and so thou shalt find ; for thou and thy complices have abused our prince this long time ; of whom thou shalt hare no more credence , but shalt have thy reward according to thy good service , as thou hast deserved in times bypast ; right so the rest of thy followers . ”</p>
   <p>1rope . 2jest .</p>
   <p>‘ Notwithstanding , the lords held them quiet till they caused certain armed men to pass into the King 's pallion , and two or three wise men to pass with them , and give the King fair pleasant words , till they laid hands on all the King 's servants and took them and hanged them before his eyes over the bridge of Lawder . Incontinent they brought forth Cochran , and his hands bound with a tow , who desired them to take one of his own pallion tows and bind his hands , for he thought shame to have his hands bound with such tow of hemp , like a thief . The lords answered , he was a traitor , he deserved no better ; and , for despight , they took a hair tether3 , and hanged him over the bridge of Lawder , above the rest of his complices . ’ — PITSCOTTIE , p. 78 , folio edit .</p>

He earnestly spoke against that measure from its commencement ; and , on the eve of the battle of Flodden , remonstrated so freely upon the impolicy of fighting , that the King said to him , with scorn and indignation , “ if he was afraid , he might go home . ” The Earl burst into tears at this insupportable insult , and retired accordingly , leaving his sons , George , Master of Angus , and Sir William of Glenbervie , to command his followers . They were both slain in the battle , with two hundred gentlemen of the name of Douglas . The aged Earl , broken-hearted at the calamities of his house and his country , retired into a religious house , where he died about a year after the field of Flodden . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>line 429 . ‘ The ruins of Tantallon Castle occupy a high rock projecting into the German Ocean , about two miles east of North Berwick . The building is not seen till a close approach , as there is rising ground betwixt it and the land . The circuit is of large extent , fenced upon three sides by the precipice which overhangs the sea , and on the fourth by a double ditch and very strong outworks . Tantallon was a principal castle of the Douglas family , and when the Earl of Angus was banished , in 1527 , it continued to hold out against James V. The King went in person against it , and for its reduction , borrowed from the Castle of Dunbar , then belonging to the Duke of Albany , two great cannons , whose names , as Pitscottie informs us with laudable minuteness , were “ Thrawn mouth 'd Meg and her Marrow ” ; also , “ two great botcards , and two moyan , two double falcons , and four quarter falcons ” ; for the safe guiding and re - delivery of which , three lords were laid in pawn at Dunbar . Yet , notwithstanding all this apparatus , James was forced to raise the siege , and only afterwards obtained possession of Tantallon by treaty with the governor , Simon Panango , When the Earl of Angus returned from banishment , upon the death of James , he again obtained possession of Tantallon , and it actually afforded refuge to an English ambassador , under circumstances similar to those described in the text . This was no other than the celebrated Sir Ralph Sadler , who resided there for some time under Angus 's protection , after the failure of his negotiation for matching the infant Mary with Edward VI . He says , that though this place was poorly furnished , it was of such strength as might warrant him against the malice of his enemies , and that he now thought himself out of danger . ( His State papers were published in 1810 , with certain notes by Scott . )</p>
   <p>‘ There is a military tradition , that the old Scottish March was meant to express the words ,</p>

     <l n="1">“ Ding down Tantallon ,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>‘ Tantallon was at length “ dung down ” and ruined by the Covenanters ; its lord , the Marquis of Douglas , being a favourer of the royal cause . The castle and barony were sold in the beginning of the eighteenth century to President Dalrymple of North Berwick , by the then Marquis of Douglas . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>In 1888 , under the direction of Mr. Walter Dalrymple , son of the proprietor , certain closed staircases in the ruins were opened , and various excavations were made , with the purpose of discovering as fully as possible what the original character of the structure had been . These operations have added greatly to the interest of the ruin , which both by position and aspect is one of the most imposing in the country .</p>

Brantome tells a story of an Italian , who entered the lists upon an unjust quarrel , but , to make his cause good , fled from his enemy at the first onset . “ Turn , coward ! ” exclaimed his antagonist . “ Thou liest , ” said the Italian , “ coward am I none ; and in this quarrel will I fight to the death , but my first cause of combat was unjust , and I abandon it . ” “ Je vous laisse a penser , ” adds Brantome , “ s'il n'y a pas de l'abus la . ” Elsewhere he says , very sensibly , upon the confidence which those who had a righteous cause entertained of victory : “ Un autre abus y avoit-il , que ceux qui avoient un juste subjet de querelle , et qu'on les faisoit jurer avant entrer au camp , pensoient estre aussitost vainqueurs , voire s'en assuroienthYpppHeNthYpppHeNils du tout , mesmes que leurs confesseurs , parrains et confidants leurs en respondoient tout-a - fait , comme si Dieu leur en eust donne une patente ; et ne regardant point a d'autres fautes passes , et que Dieu en garde la punition a ce coup la pour plus grande , despiteuse , et exemplaire . ” — Discours sur le Duels . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>line 717 . ‘ The Cross of Edinburgh was an ancient and curious structure . The lower part was an octagonal tower , sixteen feet in diameter , and about fifteen feet high . At each angle there was a pillar , and between them an arch , of the Grecian shape . Above these was a projecting battlement , with a turret at each corner , and medallions , of rude but curious workmanship , between them . Above this rose the proper Cross , a column of one stone , upwards of twenty feet high , surmounted with a unicorn . This pillar is preserved in the grounds of the property of Drum , near Edinburgh . The Magistrates of Edinburgh , in 1756 , with consent of the Lords of Session , ( proh pudor ! ) destroyed this curious monument , under a wanton pretext that it encumbered the street ; while , on the one hand , they left an ugly mass called the Luckenbooths , and , on the other , an awkward , long , and low guard-house , which were fifty times more encumbrance than the venerable and inoffensive Cross .</p>
   <p>‘ From the tower of the Cross , so long as it remained , the heralds published the acts of Parliament ; and its site , marked by radii , diverging from a stone centre , in the High Street , is still the place where proclamations are made . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>See Fergusson 's ‘ Plainstanes , ’ Poems , p. 48 . The Cross was restored by Mr. Gladstone in 1885 , to commemorate his connexion with Midlothian as its parliamentary representative .</p>
   <p>line 735 . ‘ This supernatural citation is mentioned by all our Scottish historians . It was , probably , like the apparition at Linlithgow , an attempt , by those averse to the war , to impose upon the superstitious temper of James IV . The following account from Pitscottie is characteristically minute , and furnishes , besides , some curious particulars of the equipment of the army of James IV . I need only add to it , that Plotcock , or Plutock , is no other than Pluto . The Christians of the middle ages by no means disbelieved in the existence of the heathen deities ; they only considered them as devils , and Plotcock , so far from implying any thing fabulous , was a synonyme of the grand enemy of mankind . ” { 2 } “ Yet all thir warnings , and uncouth tidings , nor no good counsel , might stop the King , at this present , from his vain purpose , and wicked enterprize , but hasted him fast to Edinburgh , and there to make his provision and famishing , in having forth of his army against the day appointed , that they should meet in the Barrow-muir of Edinburgh : That is to say , seven cannons that he had forth of the Castle of Edinburgh , which were called the Seven Sisters , casten by Robert Borthwick , the master-gunner , with other small artillery , bullet , powder , and all manner of order , as the master-gunner could devise .</p>
   <p>‘ " In this meantime , when they were taking forth their artillery , and the King being in the Abbey for the time , there was a cry heard at the Market-cross of Edinburgh at the hour of midnight , proclaiming as it had been a summons , which was named and called by the proclaimer thereof , the summons of Plotcock ; which desired all men to compear , both Earl , and Lord , and Baron , and all honest gentlemen within the town , ( every man specified by his own name ,) to compear , within the space of forty days , before his master , where it should happen him to appoint , and be for the time , under the pain of disobedience . But whether this summons was proclaimed by vain persons , night-walkers , or drunken men , for their pastime , or if it was a spirit , I cannot tell truly : but it was shewn to me , that an indweller of the town , Mr. Richard Lawson , being evil disposed , ganging in his gallery-stair foreanent the Cross , hearing this voice proclaiming this summons , thought marvel what it should be , cried on his servant to bring him his purse ; and when he had brought him it , he took out a crown , and cast over the stair , saying , ‘ I appeal from that summons , judgment , and sentence thereof , and take me all whole in the mercy of God , and Christ Jesus his son . ’ Verily , the author of this , that caused me write the manner of this summons , was a landed gentleman , who was at that time twenty years of age , and was in the town the time of the said summons ; and thereafter , when the field was stricken , he swore to me , there was no man that escaped that was called in this summons , but that one man alone which made his protestation , and appealed from the said summons : but all the lave were perished in the field with the king .

Having waged a feudal war with the Earl of Chester , Marmion 's horse fell , as he charged in the van of his troop , against a body of the Earl 's followers : the rider 's thigh being broken by the fall , his head was cut off by a common foot - soldier , ere he could receive any succour .

For this purpose , the Regent , to use the phrase of the time “ dealed with ” the ( then ) Earl of Angus for his consent to the proposed measure . He occupied himself , while she was speaking , in feeding a falcon which sat upon his wrist , and only replied by addressing the bird , but leaving the Queen to make the application . “ The devil is in this greedy gled — she will never be fou . ” But when the Queen , without appearing to notice this hint , continued to press her obnoxious request , Angus replied , in the true spirit of a feudal noble , “ Yes , Madam , the castle is yours ; God forbid else . But by the might of God , Madam ! ” such was his usual oath , “ I must be your Captain and Keeper for you , and I will keep it as well as any you can place there . ’ ” - SIR WALTER SCOTT 'S Provincial Antiquities , vol . ii . p . 167 .— Prose Works , vol . vii . p. 436 .</p>

   <p>INTRODUCTION TO CANTO SIXTH .</p>
   <p>Richard Heber ( 1773-1833 ) half-brother of Bishop Heber , was for some time M. P. for Oxford University . His large inherited fortune enabled him freely to indulge his love of books , and his , English library of 105 , 000 volumes cost him L180 , 000 . He had thousands besides on the continent . As a cherished friend of Scott 's he is frequently mentioned in the ‘ Life . ’ He introduced Leyden to Scott ( Life , i . 333 , 1837 ed . ) .</p>
   <p>‘ Mertoun House , the seat of Hugh Scott , Esq ., of Harden , is beautifully situated on the Tweed , about two miles below Dryburgh Abbey . ’ — LOCKHART .</p>
   <p>line 7 . ‘ The Iol of the heathen Danes ( a word still applied to Christmas in Scotland ; was solemnized with great festivity . The humour of the Danes at table displayed itself in pelting each other with bones , and Torfaeus tells a long and curious story , in the History of Hrolfe Kraka , of one Hottus , an inmate of the Court of Denmark , who was so generally assailed with these missiles , that he constructed , out of the bones with which he was overwhelmed , a very respectable intrenchment , against those who continued the raillery . The dances of the northern warriors round the great fires of pine - trees , are commemorated by Olaus Magnus , who says , they danced with such fury , holding each other by the hands , that , if the grasp of any failed , he was pitched into the fire with the velocity of a sling . The sufferer , on such occasions , was instantly plucked out , and obliged to quaff off a certain measure of ale , as a penalty for “ spoiling the king 's fire . " ’ - SCOTT .</p>
   <p>line 33 . Scott , after explaining that in Roman Catholic countries mass is never said at night except on Christmas eve , quotes as illustrative of early celebrations of the festival the names and descriptions of the allegorical characters in Jonson 's ‘ Christmas his Masque . ‘ The personages are Father Christmas himself and his ten sons and daughters , led in by Cupid . ‘ Baby-Cake , ’ the youngest child , is misprinted ‘ Baby-Cocke in Scott .</p>
   <p>line 45 . Post and pair , a game at cards , is one of the sons of Father Christmas in Jonson 's Masque . He comes in with ‘ a pair-royal of aces in his hat ; his garment all done over with pairs and purs ; his squire carrying a box , cards , and counters . ’</p>
   <p>line 55 . The reference is to the ancient salt-cellar , which parted superiors from inferiors at table .</p>
   <p>line 75 . ‘ It seems certain that the MUMMERS of England , who ( in Northumberland at least ) used to go about in disguise to the neighbouring houses , bearing the then useless ploughshares ; and the GUISARDS of Scotland , not yet in total disuse , present , in some indistinct degree , a shadow of the old mysteries , which were the origin of the English drama . In Scotland , ( me ipso teste ,) we were wont , during my boyhood , to take the characters of the apostles , at least of Peter , Paul , and Judas Iscariot ; the first had the keys , the second carried a sword , and the last the bag , in which the dole of our neighbours ’ plum-cake was deposited . One played as a champion , and recited some traditional rhymes ; another was :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">...." Alexander , King of Macedon ,</l>
     <l n="2">Who conquer 'd all the world but Scotland alone .</l>
     <l n="3">When he came to Scotland his courage grew cold ,</l>
     <l n="4">To see a little nation courageous and bold . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>These , and many such verses , were repeated , but by rote , and unconnectedly . There were also , occasionally , I believe , a Saint George . In all , there was a confused resemblance of the ancient mysteries , in which the characters of Scripture , the Nine Worthies , and other popular personages , were usually exhibited . It were much to be wished that the Chester Mysteries were published from the MS. in the Museum , with the annotations which a diligent investigator of popular antiquities might still supply . The late acute and valuable antiquary , Mr. Ritson , showed me several memoranda towards such a task , which are probably now dispersed or lost . See , however , his “ Remarks on Shakspeare , ” 1783 , p. 38 .</p>
   <p>‘ Since the first edition of “ Marmion ” appeared , this subject has received much elucidation from the learned and extensive labours of Mr. Douce ; and the Chester Mysteries ( edited by J. H. Markland , Esq . ) have been printed in a style of great elegance and accuracy ( in 1818 ) by Bensley and Sons , London , for the Roxburghe Club . 1830 . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>‘ The venerable old gentleman , to whom the lines are addressed was the younger brother of William Scott of Raeburn . Being the cadet of a cadet of the Harden family , he had very little to lose ; yet he contrived to lose the small property he had , by engaging in the civil wars and intrigues of the house of Stuart . His veneration for the exiled family was so great , that he swore he would not shave his beard till they were restored : a mark of attachment , which , I suppose , had been common during Cromwell 's usurpation ; for , in Cowley 's “ Cutter of Coleman Street , ” one drunken cavalier upbraids another , that , when he was not able to afford to pay a barber , he affected to “ wear a beard for the King . ” I sincerely hope this was not absolutely the original reason of my ancestor 's beard ; which , as appears from a portrait in the possession of Sir Henry Hay Macdougal , Bart ., and another painted for the famous Dr. Pitcairn , was a beard of a most dignified and venerable appearance . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>‘ " The event , on which the tale is founded , is preserved by tradition in the family of the Vaughans of Hengwyrt ; nor is it entirely lost , even among the common people , who still point out this oak to the passenger . The enmity between the two Welsh chieftains , Howel Sele , and Owen Glendwr , was extreme , and marked by vile treachery in the one , and ferocious cruelty in the other . { 3 } The story is somewhat changed and softened , as more favourable to the character of the two chiefs , and as better answering the purpose of poetry , by admitting the passion of pity , and a greater degree of sentiment in the description . Some trace of Howel Sele 's mansion was to be seen a few years ago , and may perhaps be still visible , in the park of Nannau , now belonging to Sir Robert Vaughan , Baronet , in the wild and romantic tracks of Merionethshire . The abbey mentioned passes under two names , Vener and Cymmer .

   <p>line 163 . ‘ The Daoine shi , ’ or Men of Peace , of the Scottish Highlanders , rather resemble the Scandinavian Duergar , than the English Fairies . Notwithstanding their name , they are , if not absolutely malevolent , at least peevish , discontented , and apt to do mischief on slight provocation . The belief of their existence is deeply impressed on the Highlanders , who think they are particularly offended at mortals , who talk of them , who wear their favourite colour green , or in any respect interfere with their affairs . This is especially to be avoided on Friday , when , whether as dedicated to Venus , with whom , in Germany , this subterraneous people are held nearly connected , or for a more solemn reason , they are more active and possessed of greater power . Some curious particulars concerning the popular superstitions of the Highlanders may be found in Dr. Graham 's Picturesque Sketches of Perthshire . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>Friday ( the day of the goddess Freya ) is regarded as lucky for marriages . Mr. Thiselton Dyer in ‘ Domestic Folk-lore , ’ p. 39 , quotes the City Chamberlain of Glasgow as affirming that ‘ nine-tenths of the marriages in Glasgow are celebrated on a Friday . ’ In Hungary nothing of any importance is undertaken on a Friday , and there is a Hungarian proverb which says that ‘ whoever is merry on a Friday is sure to weep on the Sunday . ’ The Sicilians make the exception for weddings . In America Friday is a lucky day-the New World , no doubt , upsetting in this as other matters the conservatism of the Old . The superstition of sailors about Friday is famous . Cp . the old English song ‘ The Mermaid . ’ For further discussion of the subject see ‘ Notes and Queries , ’ 6th S. vol . vi .</p>
   <p>line 175 . ‘ The journal of the Friend , to whom the Fourth Canto of the poem is inscribed , furnished me with the following account of a striking superstition :—</p>
   <p>‘ " Passed the pretty little village of Franchemont ( near Spaw ) , with the romantic ruins of the old castle of the counts of that name . The road leads through many delightful vales , on a rising ground : at the extremity of one of them stands the ancient castle , now the subject of many superstitions legends . It is firmly believed by the neighbouring peasantry , that the last Baron of Franchemont deposited , in one of the vaults of the castle , a ponderous chest , containing an immense treasure in gold and silver , which , by some magic spell , was intrusted to the care of the Devil , who is constantly found sitting on the chest in the shape of a huntsman . Any one adventurous enough to touch the chest is instantly seized with the palsy . Upon one occasion , a priest of noted piety was brought to the vault : he used all the arts of exorcism to persuade his infernal majesty to vacate his seat , but in vain ; the huntsman remained immovable . At last , moved by the earnestness of the priest , he told him , that he would agree to resign the chest , if the exorciser would sign his name with blood . But the priest understood his meaning , and refused , as by that act he would have delivered over his soul to the Devil . Yet if any body can discover the mystic words used by the person who deposited the treasure , and pronounced them , the fiend must instantly decamp . I had many stories of a similar nature from a peasant , who had himself seen the Devil , in the shape of a great cat . " ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>line 112 . ‘ I shall only produce one instance more of the great veneration paid to Lady Hilda , which still prevails even in these our days ; and that is , the constant opinion , that she rendered , and still renders herself visible , on some occasions , in the Abbey of Streamshalh , or Whitby , where she so long resided . At a particular time of the year ( viz . in the summer months ) , at ten or eleven in the forenoon , the sunbeams fall in the inside of the northern part of the choir ; and ‘ tis then that the spectators , who stand on the west side of Whitby churchyard , so as just to see the most northerly part of the abbey pass the north end of Whitby church , imagine they perceive , in one of the highest windows there , the resemblance of a woman , arrayed in a shroud . Though we are certain this is only a reflection caused by the splendour of the sunbeams , yet fame reports it , and it is constantly believed among the vulgar , to be an appearance of Lady Hilda in her shroud , or rather in a glorified state ; before which , I make no doubt , the Papists , even in these our days , offer up their prayers with as much zeal and devotion , as before any other image of their most glorified saint . ” CHARLTON 'S History of Whitby , p. 33 . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>A word of caution is necessary as to the ‘ many pieces ’ mentioned here . Besides his ‘ AEneid ,'Douglas ' s extant works are ‘ Palice of Honour , ’ ‘ King Hart , ’ and a poem of four stanzas entitled ‘ Conscience . ’ To each book of the ‘ AEneid , ’ however , as well as to the supplementary thirteenth book of Maphaeus Vegius , which he also translates , he prefixes an introductory poem , so that there is a sense in which it is correct to call him the author of ‘ many pieces . ’ His works were first published in complete form in 1874 , in four volumes , admirably edited by the late Dr. John Small .

The sword with which he struck so remarkable a blow , was presented by his descendant , James Earl of Morton , afterwards Regent of Scotland , to Lord Lindesay of the Byres , when he defied Bothwell to single combat on Carberry-hill .

   <p>Stanza XIV . line . Saint Bride is Saint Bridget of Ireland , who became popular in England and Scotland under the abbreviated form of her name . She was ‘ a favourite saint of the house of Douglas , and of the Earl of Angus in particular . ’ See note to Clarendon Press ‘ Lay of Last Minstrel , ’ VI . 469 .</p>
   <p>line 437 . ‘ This ebullition of violence in the potent Earl of Angus is not without its example in the real history of the house of Douglas , whose chieftains possessed the ferocity , with the heroic virtues , of a savage state . The most curious instance occurred in the case of Maclellan , Tutor of Bombay , who , having refused to acknowledge the pre-eminence claimed by Douglas over the gentlemen and Barons of Galloway , was seized and imprisoned by the Earl , in his castle of the Thrieve , on the borders of Kirkcudbrightshire . Sir Patrick Gray , commander of King James the Second 's guard , was uncle to the Tutor of Bombay , and obtained from the King a “ sweet letter of supplication , ” praying the Earl to deliver his prisoner into Gray 's hand . When Sir Patrick arrived at the castle , he was received with all the honour due to a favourite servant of the King 's household ; but while he was at dinner , the Earl , who suspected his errand , caused his prisoner to be led forth and beheaded . After dinner , Sir Patrick presented the King 's letter to the Earl , who received it with great affectation of reverence ; “ and took him by the hand , and led him forth to the green , where the gentleman was lying dead , and showed him the manner , and said , ‘ Sir Patrick , you are come a little too late ; yonder is your sister 's son lying , but he wants the head ; take his body , and do with it what you will . ’ — Sir Patrick answered again with a sore heart , and said , ‘ My lord , if ye have taken from him his head , dispone upon the body as ye please ; ’ and with that called for his horse , and leaped thereon ; and when he was on horseback , he said to the Earl on this manner : ‘ My Lord , if I live , you shall be rewarded for your labours , that you have used at this time , according to your demerits . ’</p>
   <p>‘ " At this saying the Earl was highly offended , and cried for horse . Sir Patrick , seeing the Earl 's fury , spurred his horse , but he was chased near Edinburgh ere they left him ; and had it not been his led horse was so tried and good , he had been taken .

It closes with the beautiful ascription — ‘ To Him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy . ’ There is deep significance , therefore , in this appeal of the venerable and outraged knight for the protection of St. Jude .</p>
   <p>line 457 . ‘ Lest the reader should partake of the Earl 's astonishment , and consider the crime as inconsistent with the manners of the period , I have to remind him of the numerous forgeries ( partly executed by a female assistant ) devised by Robert of Artois , to forward his suit against the Countess Matilda ; which , being detected , occasioned his flight into England , and proved the remote cause of Edward the Third 's memorable wars in France .

The second , that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits of many , that would otherwise co-operate with him , and makes a man almost alone to his own ends .

   <p>Stanza XIX line 573 , ‘ On the evening previous to the memorable battle of Flodden , Surrey 's headquarters were at Barmoor Wood , and King James held an inaccessible position on the ridge of Flodden - hill , one of the last and lowest eminences detached from the ridge of Cheviot . The Till , a deep and slow river , winded between the armies . On the morning of the 9th September , 1513 , Surrey marched in a north-westerly direction , and crossed the Till , with his van and artillery , at Twisel Bridge , nigh where that river joins the Tweed , his rear-guard column passing about a mile higher , by a ford . This movement had the double effect of placing his army between King James and his supplies from Scotland , and of striking the Scottish monarch with surprise , as he seems to have relied on the depth of the river in his front . But as the passage , both over the bridge and through the ford , was difficult and slow , it seems possible that the English might have been attacked to great advantage while straggling with these natural obstacles . I know not if we are to impute James 's forbearance to want of military skill , or to the romantic declaration which Pitscottie puts in his mouth , “ that he was determined to have his enemies before him on a plain field , ” and therefore would suffer no interruption to be given , even by artillery , to their passing the river .</p>
   <p>‘ The ancient bridge of Twisel , by which the English crossed the Till , is still standing beneath Twisel Castle , a splendid pile of Gothic architecture , as now rebuilt by Sir Francis Blake , Bart ., whose extensive plantations have so much improved the country around . The glen is romantic and delightful , with steep banks on each side , covered with copse , particularly with hawthorn . Beneath a tall rock , near the bridge , is a plentiful fountain , called St. Helen 's Well . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>That James was credited by his contemporaries with military skill and ample courage will be seen by reference to Barclay 's ‘ Ship of Fooles , ’ formerly referred to . The poet proposes a grand general European movement against the Turks , and suggests James IV as the military leader . The following complimentary acrostic is a feature of the passage :—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ I n prudence pereles is this moste comely kinge ;</l>
     <l n="2">A nd as for his strength and magnanimitie</l>

   <p>Stanza XXIII . line 682 . ‘ The reader cannot here expect a full account of the Battle of Flodden : but , so far as is necessary to understand the romance , I beg to remind him , that , when the English army , by their skilful countermarch , were fairly placed between King James and his own country , the Scottish monarch resolved to fight ; and , setting fire to his tents , descended from the ridge of Flodden to secure the neighbouring eminence of Brankstone , on which that village is built . Thus the two armies met , almost without seeing each other , when , according to the old poem of “ Flodden Field , ” —</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">“ The English line stretch 'd east and west ,</l>
     <l n="2">And southward were their faces set ;</l>
     <l n="3">The Scottish northward proudly prest ,</l>
     <l n="4">And manfully their foes they met . ”</l>
   </lg>
   <p>The English army advanced in four divisions . On the right , which first engaged , were the sons of Earl Surrey , namely , Thomas Howard , the Admiral of England , and Sir Edmund , the Knight Marshal of the army . Their divisions were separated from each other ; but , at the request of Sir Edmund , his brother 's battalion was drawn very near to his own . The centre was commanded by Surrey in person ; the left wing by Sir Edward Stanley , with the men of Lancashire , and of the palatinate of Chester . Lord Dacres , with a large body of horse , formed a reserve . When the smoke , which the wind had driven between the armies , was somewhat dispersed , they perceived the Scots , who had moved down the hill in a similar order of battle , and in deep silence . { 5 } The Earls of Huntley and of Home commanded their left wing , and charged Sir Edmund Howard with such success as entirely to defeat his part of the English right wing . Sir Edmund 's banner was beaten down , and he himself escaped with difficulty to his brother 's division . The Admiral , however , stood firm ; and Dacre advancing to his support with the reserve of cavalry , probably between the interval of the divisions commanded by the brothers Howard , appears to have kept the victors in effectual check . Home 's men , chiefly Borderers , began to pillage the baggage of both armies ; and their leader is branded , by the Scottish historians , with negligence or treachery . On the other hand , Huntley , on whom they bestow many encomiums , is said , by the English historians , to have left the field after the first charge . Meanwhile the Admiral , whose flank these chiefs ought to have attacked , availed himself of their inactivity , and pushed forward against another large division of the Scottish army in his front , headed by the Earls of Crawford and Montrose , both of whom were slain , and their forces routed . On the left , the success of the English was yet more decisive ; for the Scottish right wing , consisting of undisciplined Highlanders , commanded by Lennox and Argyle , was unable to sustain the charge of Sir Edward Stanley , and especially the severe execution of the Lancashire archers . The King and Surrey , who commanded the respective centres of their armies , were meanwhile engaged in close and dubious conflict . James , surrounded by the flower of his kingdom , and impatient of the galling discharge of arrows , supported also by his reserve under Bothwell , charged with such fury that the standard of Surrey was in danger . At that critical moment , Stanley , who had routed the left wing of the Scottish , pursued his career of victory , and arrived on the right flank , and in the rear of James 's division , which , throwing itself into a circle , disputed the battle till night came on . Surrey then drew back his forces ; for the Scottish centre not having been broken , and the left wing being victorious , he yet doubted the event of the field . The Scottish army , however , felt their loss , and abandoned the field of battle in disorder , before dawn . They lost , perhaps , from eight to ten thousand men ; but that included the very prime of their nobility , gentry , and even clergy . Scarce a family of eminence but has an ancestor killed at Flodden ; and there is no province in Scotland , even at this day , where the battle is mentioned without a sensation of terror and sorrow . The English also lost a great number of men , perhaps within one-third of the vanquished , but they were of inferior note .— See the only distinct detail of the Field of Flodden in PINKERTON 'S History , Book xi ; all former accounts being full of blunders and inconsistency .</p>
   <p>‘ The spot from which Clara views the battle , must be supposed to have been on a hillock commanding the rear of the English right wing , which was defeated , and in which conflict Marmion is supposed to have fallen . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>Lockhart adds this quotation :— ‘ In 1810 , as Sir Carnaby Haggerstone 's workmen were digging in Flodden Field , they came to a pit filled with human bones , and which seemed of great extent ; but , alarmed at the sight , they immediately filled up the excavation , and proceeded no farther .</p>
   <p>‘ In 1817 , Mr. Grey of Millfield Hill found , near the traces of an ancient encampment , a short distance from Flodden Field , a tumulus , which , on removing , exhibited a very singular sepulchre . In the centre , a large urn was found , but in a thousand pieces . It had either been broken to pieces by the stones falling upon it when digging , or had gone to pieces on the admission of the air . This urn was surrounded by a number of cells formed of flat stones , in the shape of graves , but too small to hold the body in its natural state . These sepulchral recesses contained nothing except ashes , or dust of the same kind as that in the urn . ” — Sykes ’ Local Records ( 2 vols . 8vo , 1833 ) , vol . ii . pp . 60 and 109 . ’</p>
   <p>Stanza XXIV . line 717 . ‘ Sir Brian Tunstall , called in the romantic language of the time , Tunstall the Undefiled , was one of the few Englishmen of rank slain at Flodden . He figures in the ancient English poem , to which I may safely refer my readers , as an edition , with full explanatory notes , has been published by my friend , Mr. Henry Weber . Tunstall , perhaps , derived his epithet of undefiled from his white armour and banner , the latter bearing a white cock , about to crow , as well as from his unstained loyalty and knightly faith . His place of residence was Thurland Castle . ’ — SCOTT .</p>

   <p>Stanza XXXIII . lines 999-1004 . Charlemagne 's rear-guard under Roland was cut to pieces by heathen forces at Roncesvalles , a valley in Navarre , in 778 . Roland might have summoned his uncle Charlemagne by blowing his magic horn , but this his valour prevented him from doing till too late . He was fatally wounded , and the ‘ Song of Roland , ’ telling of his worth and prowess , is one of the best of the mediaeval romances . Olivier was also a distinguished paladin , and the names of the two are immortalized in the proverb ‘ A Rowland for an Oliver . ’ Fontarabia is on the coast of Spain , about thirty miles from Roncesvalles . See Paradise Lost , I . 586 , and note in Clarendon Press ed .</p>

   <p>line 1059 . Lockhart here gives an extract from Jeffrey :— ‘ The powerful poetry of these passages can receive no illustration from any praise or observations of ours . It is superior , in our apprehension , to all that this author has hitherto produced ; and , with a few faults of diction , equal to any thing that has ever been written upon similar subjects . From the moment the author gets in sight of FIodden Field , indeed , to the end of the poem , there is no tame writing , and no intervention of ordinary passages . He does not once flag or grow tedious ; and neither stops to describe dresses and ceremonies , nor to commemorate the harsh names of feudal barons from the Border . There is a flight of five or six hundred lines , in short , in which he never stoops his wing , nor wavers in his course ; but carries the reader forward with a more rapid , sustained , and lofty movement , than any epic bard that we can at present remember . ’</p>
   <p>Stanza XXXV . 1 . 1067 . Lockhart quotes from Byron 's ‘ Lara ’ as a parallel ,—</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Day glimmers on the dying and the dead ,</l>
     <l n="2">The cloven cuirass , and the helmless head , ’ &amp; c .</l>

   <p>line 1084 . ‘ There can be no doubt that King James fell in the battle of Flodden . He was killed , says the curious French Gazette , within a lance 's length of the Earl of Surrey ; and the same account adds , that none of his division were made prisoners , though many were killed ; a circumstance that testifies the desperation of their resistance . The Scottish historians record many of the idle reports which passed among the vulgar of their day . Home was accused , by the popular voice , not only of failing to support the King , but even of having carried him out of the field , and murdered him . And this tale was revived in my remembrance , by an unauthenticated story of a skeleton , wrapped in a bull 's hide , and surrounded with an iron chain , said to have been found in the well of Home Castle , for which , on enquiry , I could never find any better authority than the sexton of the parish having said , that , IF THE WELL WERE CLEANED OUT , HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED AT SUCH A DISCOVERY . Home was the chamberlain of the King , and his prime favourite ; he had much to lose ( in fact did lose all ) in consequence of James 's death , and nothing earthly to gain by that event : but the retreat , or inactivity , of the left wing , which he commanded , after defeating Sir Edmund Howard , and even the circumstance of his returning unhurt , and loaded with spoil , from so fatal a conflict , rendered the propagation of any calumny against him easy and acceptable . Other reports gave a still more romantic turn to the King 's fate , and averred , that James , weary of greatness after the carnage among his nobles , had gone on a pilgrimage , to merit absolution for the death of his father , and the breach of his oath of amity to Henry . In particular , it was objected to the English , that they could never show the token of the iron belt ; which , however , he was likely enough to have laid aside on the day of battle , as encumbering his personal exertions . They produce a better evidence , the monarch 's sword and dagger , which are still preserved in the Herald 's College in London . Stowe has recorded a degrading story of the disgrace with which the remains of the unfortunate monarch were treated in his time . An unhewn column marks the spot where James fell , still called the King 's Stone . ’ — SCOTT . See also Mr. Jerningham 's ‘ Norham Castle , ’ chap . xi .</p>
   <p>line 1084 . See above , V. vii , &amp; c .</p>
   <p>Stanza XXXVI . line 1096 . ‘ This storm of Lichfield Cathedral , which had been garrisoned on the part of the King , took place in the Great Civil War . Lord Brook , who , with Sir John Gill , commanded the assailants , was shot with a musket-ball through the vizor of his helmet . The royalists remarked that he was killed by a shot fired from St. Chad 's Cathedral , and upon St. Chad 's day , and received his death-wound in the very eye with which , he had said , he hoped to see the ruin of all the cathedrals in England . The magnificent church in question suffered cruelly upon this , and other occasions ; the principal spire being ruined by the fire of the besiegers . ’ — SCOTT .</p>
   <p>Ceadda , or Chad , after resigning the bishopric of York in 669 A. D ., was appointed Bp . of Lichfield , where he ‘ lived for a little while in great holiness . ’ See Hunt 's ‘ English Church in the Middle Ages , ’ p. 17 .</p>
   <p>line 1110 . The allusion is to the old fragment on Flodden , which has been so skilfully extended by Jean Elliot and also by Mrs. Cockburn in their national lyrics , ‘ The Flowers o ’ the Forest . ’</p>
   <p>line 1117 . Once more the poet uses the irony of events with significant force .</p>
   <p>Stanza XXXVII . line 1125 . There is now a font of stone with a drinking cup , and an inscription on the back of the font runs thus : -</p>
   <lg>
     <l n="1">‘ Drink , weary pilgrim , drink and stay ,</l>
     <l n="2">Rest by the well of Sybil Grey . ’</l>

   <p>Stanza XXXVIII . In this stanza the poet indicates the spirit in which romances are written , clearly indicating that those only that have ears will be able to hear . ‘ Phonanta sunetoisin ’ might be the watchword of all imaginative writers . Cp . Thackeray 's ‘ Rebecca and Rowena . ’</p>
   <p>line 1155 . Hall and Holinshed were chroniclers of the sixteenth century , to both of whom Shakespeare was indebted for pliant material .</p>

    <head>L'ENVOY .</head>
    <head>Scott 's fondness for archaisms makes him add his L'Envoy in the manner of early English and Scottish poets . See e. g . Spenser 's ‘ Shepherd 's Calendar ’ and the ‘ Phoenix ’ of James VI .</head>

   <p>line 17 . This hearty wish is uttered , no doubt , with certain reminiscences of the author 's own school days . His youthful spirit , and his genial sympathy with the young , are prominent features in the character of Sir Walter Scott .</p>
